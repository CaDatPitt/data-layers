Tmcker-Related Vtblence A Pressure./vlounts Against Fee 

Continues Sharp Decline

ASSOCIATED PRESS--Trucker-
related violence on Pennsylvania
highways continued to decline
sharply Sunday and National Guard
units activated to deal with the
situation beganto return home.

But state officials, after a
meeting in Harrisburg, said 3,000
men would remain on a special
alert status if a rapid callup is
needed.

Truck traffic continued to in-
crease and a Guard spokesman said
“the incident of violence is near
zero."

During the 10 days of patroling
the highways with state policemen,
some 11,000 guardsmen have been
rotated to deal with the violence
spawned by the truckers’ protest
for lower diesel fuel rates.

The Guard said the 3,000 man
unit is from five hand-picked
battalions around Pennsylvania.
Meanwhile, the Guard’s emer-
gency operations center at Indian-
town Gap military reservation is to
continue operating 24 hours a day,
indefinitely. ,

Gov. Shapp, while urging inde-

J pendent truckers to accept last

week's agreement with the federal
government, charged Sunday that
President Nixon's radio address
“grossly misrepresented two as-
pects of the truckers’ strike...

“First, he (Nixon) indicated
government action this past week
eliminated all the hardships of the
truckers," said Shapp, himself a
former trucker. “Then he called
the truckers desperados.”

Shapp said the Nixon address
Saturday was typical of an
administration which applies un-

\ complimentary terms to those who

disagree with it.

Free Press Topic

At Forum Tonight

Freedom of the press will be
discussed tonight by Sander
Vanocur, former NBC television
news correspondent, and James M.
Naughton, New York Times
reporter, at 8:30 pm in Lawrence
Hall.

Vanocur, presently a consultant
for the Center for the Study of
Democratic Institutions, will
explore “The Media and the First
Amendment.” Naughton, a
congressional correspondent for
the Times‘ Washington bureau,
will speak on “Watergate: The
Testing of a Free Press.”

An audience question-answer
period will follow the two speeches.

The program. which is sponsored
by the Pitt News is free and open to
the public.

State police also reported a sharp
decline of trucker-related violence
following the announcement of a
tentative agreement to halt the
shutdown.

Several independent truckers’
organizations voted to return to
work. Some workers laid off by
industries that 'rely on truck
shipments were being called back
to work. And ofﬁcials reported a
cutback in the National Guard force
patrolling highways and over-
passes.

According to the state police, the
only shooting incident Saturday
night occurred on the Schuylkill
Expressway near Philadelphia.
Police said snipers fired one shot at
a tractor-trailer from an overpass.

Pressure continued to mount
yesterday for the University to
absolve the 25 cent time schedule
charge slated to go into effect
February 19.

Student leaders from eight
campus organizations met last
night to discuss objectives in
forcing the University to drop the
fee idea.

It was also reported -State
Representative K. Leroy lrvis
spoke with Chancellor Posvar last
week to voice his disapproval of the
charge. lrvis is also on Pitt’s Board
of Trustees.

Furick, in explaining the Univer-
sity’s policy, said perhaps Vice-
Chancellor of Operations Joseph
Dutton “wanted to see if he could
set a precedent” to institute similar
charges in the future by estab-
lishing the time schedule charge.
He has assurances from. Dutton,
however. that there will never be a
$5 fee for add-dropping.

Towers, BB Gun Shooting
Evokes Police Inquiry

BY RITA VITOLO
A BB gun remains in Campus
Police custody pending investiga-
tion of a shooting incident in the

Towers last week, Inspector
Charles H. Brevard conﬁrmed
Friday. No formal charges have

been ﬁled against the Tower A
resident allegedly involved.

A series of BB shots were
reportedly ﬁred from the student's
dorm window in the direction of
Tower C, shattering a window and
injuring a female resident.

Pending an upcoming Residence

Hall ‘Judicial Board’ hearing, the’

student’s name is being withheld
on request of his Legal Awareness
Committee [LAC] counsel Kevin
Joyce.

‘‘It was a matter that could

.possibly have been settled in

house." Brevard said. “We
decided that it would be possible to
handle this case ourselves if the
presiding magistrate would agree.

We're going to take this thing as
far as possible through our own
judicial system, and avoid the
courts.

“The person involved did not
realize the danger involved in his
action."

The decision not to file criminal
charges was made, Brevard stated,
after consulting with Coordinator of
Residence Life Marian E. Hirst,
Assistant Director of University
Housing Joann Woodson, and

Coordinator for the'_,Campus Judi,-_

cial System Al Bowen.

“Very happy” was Joyce’s
reaction to the decision to keep the
case within the University, al-
though he stated he had not seen

(Continued on Page 3)

Odd-even system

“But I am afraid this might be
setting that precedent,” Furick
said.

Claiming that students already
pay for the time schedule service in
the academic invoice, Furick said,
“It is an inequality to pay the
University twice for the same
service.”

The new Board President told
the students Dutton established the
charge for two reasons; 1)‘ to
generate money for operations, and
2) to eliminate waste.

Today at the University Senate
council meeting and later this week
at the Student Affairs Advisory
Council [SAAC] meeting Furick
said he intends to raise the issue
again.

“We hope to have Dutton at
SAAC to answer questions face to
face unless this thing is called off
by then,” Furick said.

Duttonjs scheduled to meet with
representatives of Student Govern-
ment ‘in his Cathedral ofﬁce
Tuesday. ‘ -

In other student opposition to the
fee, Sam Rosenzweig, a Demo-
cratic Committeeman and Pres-
ident of College Young Democrats,
has signaled local politicians to add
their support.

As a result Representative lrvis
talked to Posvar last week and
according to Rosenzweig. Repre-

sentative. Ivan Itkin will call early.

this week.

“I‘ll do anything I can to keep up
the pressure," Rosenzweig said.

Vice-Chancellor of Operations
Joseph Dutton.

“I've seen Dutton operate before
and I think it’s about time he's put
in his place.”

Rosenzweig, who also intends to
call Representatives Joseph
Rhodes, James Romanelli, and
Senator Frank Mazzei, reported,
“The idea seemed a little ridic-
ulous to [Rep.] lrvis too.”

As a response to lrvis’ call last
week to Posvar, Dr. Ray Coble,
Executive Assistant to the Chan-
cellor. called Rosenzweig and said
the Universtiy plans to “reevaluate

the situation more carefully during . .

the next -week. ”

Pa. Rationing Plan Proposed Today

HARRISBURG AP--Community
Affairs Sec. William H. Wilcox is to
present a plan for gasoline
rationing in Pennsylvania to Gov.
Shapp on Monday.

“The. plan is subject to change,”
a Wilcox aide said Sunday, “But
right now we seem to be leaning
towards an odd-even system, using

plate.”
He added the rationing proposal

would be-similar to the so-called ‘

“Oregon Plan," with motorists

able to purchase gas on an even-or
odd-numbered day. Several other
states have adopted similar plans,
and it goes into effect Monday in
New. Jersey.

The aide indicated no date has

 

yet been considered for
rationing in Pennsylvania.
Meanwhile in Scranton, Mayor
Eugene J . Peters and area ofﬁcials
unanimously agreed Sunday to

immediately initiate a gas rationing _

system in Lackawanna County.
The system, which goes into

effect Monday, would allow motor- '

ists with an odd-numbered .car
inspection sticker to purchase on
odd-numbered days, and those
with even numbers on even days.

Oil
attended the meeting Sunday noted
that 40 per cent of the stations were
closed and those opened have been
limiting their sales of gas to about
$3, and only to regular customers.

Rep. Joseph M. McDade, R-Pa., - '

was asked at the meeting to
investigate why company-owned
Kayo stations in the county have
apparently unlimited gas, while
independents’ supplies have been
cut some 20 per cent.

Powers said, ‘‘It would be wise to

Granted Second Review

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY
A student who faced dismissal
from the School of Social Work

(SSW) in December under charges -

of disrupting classes and improper
conduct of a workshop will be
afforded access to a second
academic review under a system
recently revised because of his
case, according to the administra-
tion of the school.

When an academic review board
recommended last December that
Franklyn’ Wepner, the student
involved, be dismissed, Wepner
protested the recommendation and
called for a revision of the academic
review process in SSW.

A new problem-solving system

was then instituted whereby a’

question of academic status raised
by a student’s advisor would be
handed over to an administrative
officer ot effect the appointment of
a new advisor for the student. This
program introduces this intermed-
iary step .between the student’s
initial advisor and the associate
dean, adding a second decision-
step before a consideration before a
full academic review.

An administrative memorandum
indicates Wepner’s case will be

returned to the administrative
officer level in the . revised
proceedure.

Lay an egg--simple. All you
need is a chicken. But to propel
this egg, like an embryonic
warhead, at a target and score a
direct hit isn’t the easiest thing for
a freshman engineering student to
do.

Today and tomorrow about 100
freshmen, divided into 30
teams, will present original solu-
tions to a problem of design. The
students must find a way to propel
an egg 16 fee_t, over a barrier
located‘ at a half-way point, and
onto a bull’s-eye target.

Solutions will be judged on
originality and success of delivery.
“The purpose of the experiment _is
-to see how imaginative they can
be,” said Dr. Alan Brainard,
director of freshmen engineering
programs.

“If they had more background in
engineering they would be able to
come up with lots more solutions.
The real challenge is to come up
with something novel."

Delivery systems might range
from tiny robot cars to miniature
dirgibles. One group of students
has designed a small cart with a
long bar extending from the front.
At the tip of the bar is a basket-
which carries the egg. The car will
travel on a straight course until_ it
bumps the barrier, triggering a
lever that will drop the egg onto the
target. ~

Another group of students have
designed a small car that will travel
in a wide semi-circle around the
barrier to the target.

Brainard said, “This has been
done once before but this is the
first time it’s being done with

Mile Long Line Wastes
l5O Gal. Gas Per Hour

WASHINGTON AP--If you've
ever wondered how much gasoline
is wasted waiting in line for more
gasoline, Consumers Union pro-
vided an answer Thursday. ,

Its tests show a mile-long line of
idling cars burns up 150 gallons of
gasoline every hour, the non-proﬁt

product testing organization re-

ported.
That‘s for six-cylinder cars.

I Eight-cylinder cars burn an esti-

mated 67 per cent more gasoline,
Consumers Union said.

The organization explained that
the figure holds even if an

individual driver doesn’t spend an
hour in line. If the line is moving,
as long as it stays one mile long for
an hour, the cars will burn the 150
gallons or more.

Consumers Union advised mo-
torists to shut off their engines if
they expect to sit still for longer
than a minute.

And if the lines in your
ne'ighborhood aren’t a mile long,
Consumers Union suggested look-
ing at it this way: Ten lines
stretching two blocks would burn
up the same amount as the
one-mile line.

BB Gun Shooting

(Continued from Page 1)
the official charges against his
client-.

“I know there was a shooting, I
know there is a gun in custody, but
I'm not convinced that my client is
responsible for the incident.”

Joyce contends the‘ presence of
the gun in the student's possession
does not establish his guilt.

“A BB gun is in custody, we can’t
refute that. But I’m sure he’s not
the only kid in Tower A that could
have one, and it hasn't been proven
yet that he was the one who ﬁred
the shots.”

According to Joyce, the freshman
student maintains he is innocent
and claims to have an alibi for the
time of the incident. The hearing
has not been scheduled, and Joyce
declined to speculate beforehand
on the outcome.

Acting on information obtained
from an unnamed source, Campus
Police obtained a search warrant
for the room and took the gun into
custody. Described as a gas-
operated BB gun,” Brev.ard char-
acterized it as a “very powerful
weapon,” potentially “very dan-
if aimed at the right

gerous
. places.”

_ : BY SHARON SEXTON

Students and administrators
alike agree the present Student
Union is an inadequate answer to
students‘ needs. Short on office

' space, lacking in conference,

"concert and recreational facilities.
those involved maintain the num-
bers and the needs of the students

‘have long since outgrown Schenley
Hall.

A Plans for a new union, tailored to
the specific needs of Pitt’s size and
population complexion are now
being discussed. The complete

. renovation of the present Union

with the addition of a new facility
around, in front of or behind it, is

A-now a more tangible, though not

immediate, possiblity.

Student and administrative dis-
content with the Union dates back
to October 1972 when Student
Government set up the Task'Force
That
task force submitted proposals for
the new union to the Chancellor-
Wesley Posvar, who then directed

 that the Study Commission of the

Student Union be set up.

The Chancellor intended that the
Commission, headed by Student
Union Manager Terry Milani.

determine typical space needs by
studying other college unions and
using those to determine the needs
of a university Pitt’s size.
Barring a major setback, the
Commission hopes to have the
surveys completed and translated
into square foot requirements by
late spring. Milani hopes

' architects will be hired at that time

to draw plans for the new facility.

He projects the size and design of
the building will be known by the
end of the year.

The Study Commission, in a
preliminary philosophy statement,
proposes that the “facility reflect
an acknowledgement of the impor-
tance of co-curricular and extra-
curricular activities and a commit-
ment to the development of a
meaningful community life at the
University of Pittsburgh.

Within this broad conceptual
framework the Commission pro-
poses the union be a center for 1)
spontaneous education, 2) leisure
time and recreation 3) student
services, and 4) self-governance
and programming.

In keeping with these role
expectations, the Commission an-
ticipates the union will house

Union Manager Terry Milani

conduct a detailed study on the '"

question ofthe new union making a
final projection of needs and costs.

At that time, Chancellor Posvar
listed the construction of a new
union facility as the number one
priority in Pitt’s 1973-74 capital
expenditures budget to Harris-

] burg. That request was denied and

a similar request in the 1974-75
budget reestablishing the union as
Pitt’s first funding priority is still
pending.

The Study Commission is pre-
sently conducting surveys to
determine student needs and
expectations in respect to a new
union. Questionnaires have been
sent to commuters and General
Studies students. and are being
mailed to residents, commuters.
and graduate stu-
dents, the faculty and admini-
stration.

Upon completion of those sur-
veys the Office of Space and
Planning will tabulate the results
and attempt to translate the
expressed needs into square foot
requirements.

Concurrently,
Planning office

the Space and
is trying to

conference facllities,“§tudent ser-
vices [health service, counseling,
etc.] student activities, recreational
facilities, programming space,
overnight facilities for commuters,
food services, ticket sales and
possibly small scale athletic facil-
ities, exercise rooms, saunas and
showers.

Progress toward that final goal of
a shining student union on the
corner of Fifth. Forbes and
Bigelow. has been slow. Two
months ago the Commission was
not much further on the road to the
union that the Task Force was in
October 1972.

Milani and other members of the
Commission do not feel the
Commission's slow progress is any
cause for alarm. As Milani
explains, because there is as yet no
money earmarked for the new
union. the Commission does not
feel the need to act speedily.

“We can afford to take our time
and do it right because as of now
the project hasn't been funded.
We’ll probably be done with the
study by the end of the summer,
but we probably still won’t have
any money.”

  
 
 

The likelihood and the timing of
funding for the project is a source
of much speculation by those
involved. The funding is expected
to come from three sources: the
state ($4.9 million), the students
($4.9 million), _and the alumni ($2
million).

In regard to the funding for 74-75
Assistant Vice-Chancellor of Public
Affairs. and a member of the
Commission, Jay Roling, says. “I
am not optimistic even though it is
our number one project."

Roling explained that in the list
of the state’s priorities for funding
released the Secretary of Education
John Pittenger last fall, construc-
tion of new facilities is the last in a
series of priorities. In addition,
Governor Milton Shapp expressed
his hope that funding to state
schools be kept to $200 million this
year--state school budget requests
for this year total $600 million.

The project, if funded, will be
under the arm of the General State
Authority (GSA). GSA will accept
the responsibility for providing the
money, the architectural expertise,
negotiating contracts and super-
vising construction.

GSA’s involvement in the con-
struction of the facility may create
additional problems since that body
will not participate in the construc-
tion of recreational facilities. This
means none of the state money may
go toward the construction of game
rooms, athletic facilities, saunas,
etc. ,

Plans to gut the present Union
and remodel it for recreational
facilities 'with money from a
separate source while housing the
administrative-service-conference
facilities in the other separate but
adjacent building are being con-
sidered as possible solutions to this

' conflict.

Other monies, hopefully match-
ing or exceeding the state’s
allocation. will be collected from
students, Milani explained.

The money may be collected in
the form of a student union fee
attached to each full-time student’s
invoice. .

Milani and Roling both anti-
cipate problems in the collection of
this money as students who will not
enjoy the new ‘union before
graduation will be paying toward it.

Milani hopes the third chunk of
money will come from alumni. The
alumni have had some input into
the planning of the union to date,
and it is likely, according to Milani,
that an Office of Alumni Affairs will

be included in the administrative
portion of the building.

”An optimistic
  projection
would be

completion

within  
five years.”

 

Sources involved in the planning
of the union speculate two million
of the $35 million collected in the
alumni’s 10 year capital fund
raising campaign will be ear-
marked for the construction of the
union. This money should be

available within five years.

 

Because of the uncertainty which
surrounds the funding from the
state and the students: it is
impossible "to make an accurate
projection for the completion of the
new union.
optimistic projection would be
completion within five years.”

In the interim, to better address
those needs which the University
feels the present union is neglec-
ting, $110,000 from Physical Plant
will be used to “rejuvenate” the
Union. '

Milani, who is in charge of these
renovations, says the money will be
used for painting of the Ballroom,
the lobby, the Venetian Room sun
porch, and the two porches atl
either main entrance and carpet,
drapes and, furnishings for the
reception area, the Lower Lounge,
the Venetian Room, the Pine Room
and the patio.

The money will also go toward a.
in the

new ice cream
recreation center. .

Milani plans to request funds at
the end of this fiscal year for a
complete renovation of the Hunt
Room food service facility.

BY ADRIAN MC COY

Watching the Studio Theatre
production of Sam Shepard's Mad
Dog Blues is like riding down a four
lane highway at 90 miles an hour
and being bombarded by billboard
advertisements. The play is
presented as a high speed
theatrical cubism where the viewer
is given a series of impressions
which fit together. after the
performance. The production gives
a sense of continuity to a script that
tends to wander at times. The pace
like a
Kerouac novel.

The anti—plot of Mad Dog Blues
concerns the exploits of two
protagonists; a ’50’s greaser
named Yahoodi (Robert Reusch)
and a‘ '70's rock star, Kosmo
(Anthony Eck). The only real
action of the play is their encounter
with a bizarre assortment of
anachronisms with whom they set
out a journey to discover gold
somewhere in the jungle.

The cast is a strange hybrid
what has become the American
mythology; it ranges from Marlene
Dietrich to Paul Bunyan, and from
an exotic Mae West to an equally
exotic Captain Kidd.

There are two teams in pursuit of
the hidden treasure;
Yahoodi’s, consisting of Captain
Kidd (Joseph Morris) and Marlene
Dietrich (Paula Swart). until she is

one is‘

carried away by Paul Bunyan (Jim
Diederich). They are pursued by
Kosmo's gang--Mae West (Eliza-
beth Delgado) and Waco (Stan
Feingold). a‘ howling, displaced
cowboy. The treasure is. guarded
by the ghost of an Indian girl
(Marilyn McWilliams). People
make friends, lose them, and find

-them again. Their frenzied search

for gold reveals them in all their
base selfishness.

After much plotting and counter-
plotting, the treasure ﬁnally falls
into the‘ hands of Mae West and
Jesse James (Philip Thomson).

Rock III: “We called if.

BY JIM MALONEY
Ed. Note: In the third part of the
continuing history of Rock ’n Roll,
Jim will talk about the emergence
of a Rock ’n Roll identity from the
Rhythm & Blues style in the fifties.

certain elements of “country"
bluesmen (Muddy Waters. Elmore

market.

The R&B artists who did not
ride in on the rock 'n roll surge of

 1955 still contribute much to the

fifties’ sound. Horns and a tight

' rhythm section worked well for

Otis. Roy Brown, and
similar “jump" performers. This
period also saw memorable work by
Bo Diddley. Huey “Piano" Smith.
Lloyd Price and others.

were male, Atlantic’s Ruth Brown

pioneered in the area of harmony.
Their emphasis was on a vocal
rather than instrumental effect.
fifties got underway,
groups like the Clovers, Mid-
nighters, and Drifters developed a
singing style based on the “bird”
harmony. Their work often utilized
the call and response patterns of
the earliest blues tradition. They
also demonstrated a heavy gospel
base in their vocal styles.

spiritual sound that shook black
storefront churches and soothed
Southern Baptist congregations in
the 20’s and 305. Most R&B
performers will acknowledge at
least a partial digestion of gospel
techniques in their music.

The Drifters and Coasters pro-

bably come to mind first when -

examining vocal groups of the
fifties. The Drifters were the most
prolific of such groups and
certainly among the most highly
regarded. The original lineup
included the late Clyde McPhatter,
one of the most important voices in
Rock and Roll.

From the West Coast came the
Robins. They became the Coasters
and joined forces with the brilliant
songwriting team of Jerry Lieber
and Mike Stoller. This pair penned
“Hound Dog.” “Jailhouse Rock,"
and all of the Coasters’ big hits.
The descendants of this vocal
group tradition would appear in the
early sixties in the form of the
Temptations, Four Tops, and
Miracles.

And so it is that one style builds
on another. It's interesting to note
that the sophisticated jazz of every

period carries elements of the
blues. From Louis Armstrong and
Fletcher Henderson to Miles Davis
and John Coltrane. the blues lends
vitality to the jazz form.

Consider the vocal style of Little
Richard a fusion of blues and
gospel. Probably developed from
early black spiritual services, this
same method was used to a more
subtle extent by the late Sam
Cooke. Otis Redding picked it up
from there. combining Cooke's
subtlety with Richard’s agonizing
wail. The R&B sound. immersed in
the gospel roots, came out dripping
“soul."

This hand me down nature of

blues is the secret of its survival.
When called upon to change with
the pulse of the times it responded.
Country blues was urbanized.
traditional blues was stylized, to
become R&B. Blues has met the
challenge of every musical trend
from swing to acid rock and
remains the most potent folk music
America has produced.
- [The final installment will follow
the blues/R&B sound as it was
adapted and utilized by the white
rockabilly artists circa 1955].

characters. This comes out mostly
in their relationship with one
another. which shifts from
possessive friendship to revulsion
to honest rapport. Their paranoia
and elaborate rationalizations are
part of a game they play where they
“support each other's inability to
function." as Kosmo puts it.

The set is an abstract. all-purpose
white platform which suggests the
hard lines of modern sculpture as
well as the sterility of urban life. A
versatile and fluid light design
compliments the playing space and
creates impressions of distances
in time and space where there are
none: the stage becomes east coast
and west coast simultaneously and
characters can speak to one another
long distance.

- The production is an eclectic
mixture of all your old favorite
movie actors and techniques.
Elements of vaudeville are used
here successfully.

Mad Dog Blues presents a comic

view of America as cinematic pipe
dream. but also makes a serious
statement on America as paranoid,
big city nightmare. It is a play
about barriers; barriers between
the real and the ideal, the barriers
between people, the old communi-
cation breakdown. The quality of
the language is consistent with

this. varying from the poetic to the -

obscene to the banal. with lines‘
like. "I just wanna play my
music." . -_ I

The relationship between Ya-

hoodi. the '50s kid. and Kosmo. the.

'70s kid. cancels itself out in a kind
of lukewarm 1960's philosophy:

“I'm gonna find a guru. I'm gonna
go off in the country and eat brown
rice.“ There is the idea that if It's

not on the east coast. Hhniaybe lt’s
the west coast. or if lt’s not in the

city. then It must be in the country.

When It turns out to be a sack full
of bottle caps, no one is too
disillusioned. The viewer is left
with the feeling that these people
will go on searching forever.
because their fantasies are larger
than their realities.

Willie Dixon

New Roses For A Blues

BY DOUGLAS E. GEBHARD

“Now I got my bread and a
house and a band. and I still got my
music. That’s all a man needs."
So after all these years other people
recording your material and little
recognition from anybody, let alone
the musical press, and a resur-
gence of rock brings the fame out of
the closet (so to speak).

Willie Dixon has been living on
this planet for fifty-nine years. His
music has been with us for at least
forty of them, but recognition of his
talent hasn’t seen‘ it’s highest
possible peak, until, possibly, now.

Ovation: records has released
“Willie Dixon: Catalyst”
IOVQD/1433] with some old
classics and many new tunes by the
“catalyst” of rock and blues.
“Bring It On Home,” “I Just
Want To Make Love To You,”
“Wang Dang Doodle,” and “My
Babe” are the four oldies.

Most of us know Willie via other
bands and their tunes. For
instance: Cream/“Crossroads” &
“Spoonful;" Johnny Rivers/“The
Seventh Son;” Doors/“Back Door
Man;" Pointer ‘Sisters/“Wane

—_K—night Paces 71-56 Syracuse Routing

BY RON SIEGEL
SPORTS EDITOR
Only a plague can keep the Pitt
basketball team out of the NCAA
playoffs. Common injuries won't
do the trick. With three starters in
bad shape after Wednesday's Kent
State victory, many were expecting
Pitt's winning streak to be broken
Saturday night at’the Field House.
It wasn't. The Panthers rallied
behind their walking wounded to
convincingly crush Syracuse. 71-
56, and up their win streak to 19.
Only an opening game loss at West
Virginia mars the Cats’ record.
Leading the way for Pitt once
again was Billy Knight. Playing
with his left shoulder heavily taped
for the third straight game,
“Mooney” hit for 24 points and
snared 19 rebounds, both game
highs. ’
Mickey Martin, not expected to

play, did, and contributed much .

more than his two point production
indicated.

“Mickey did fairly well for us,"
said a smiling Buzz Ridl in the
bubbling Pitt locker room after the
game. “He wasn't in good
condition because of the layoff.
(He missed a week of practice.) As
for Billy Knight, well he looked like
a healthy Billy Knight.”

In a game marred by poor
shooting at both ends of the floor,
Pitt came out ahead statistically as
well as on the scoreboard. The
Cats shot 46.3% from the ﬁeld,
below their average, and a poor
50% from the free throw line.
Syracuse shot much worse. The
Orange went 32.9% from the floor
and just 40% from the charity
stripe.

It will be tough for Knight to make
All-American, but when other
schools tout the likes of Dennis
[Sweet D] DuVal, he seems to be a
shoo-in. Gunning away from all
over the -court, usually nowhere

near normal shooting range, DuVal
shot a miserable four for 13.

“It was very important for our
Eastern prestige that we win
decisively," said Ridl. “Syracuse
would have had something to talk
about if they had beaten us on our
home court."

The home court advantage was
quite evident as 5,308 fans were on
their feet screaming when “Tiger”
Paul Auslander took the floor thirty
minutes before gametime.

The game opened fairly even,
with Tommy Richards popping
jumpers from both sides to pace the
Panthers in "the early going.
Syracuse took the lead 13-12 on a
Jim Lee baseline jump shot, but it
didn’t last for long, and didn’t
happen again.

Martin scored his only two points
of the game to put the Cats ahead
for good. He took a deft pass from
Jim Bolla for an easy layup, and the
Panthers were on their way.

Bolla_ sunk two ﬁeld goals of his
own to put Pitt -ahead by ﬁve. The
Orange started sending in fresh
troops, trying to match Pitt's
supersubs, but once again, Ridl's
bench proved mightier. Keith
Starr and Lew Hill sunk layups and
the Panthers led by nine, 24-15.

Willie Kelly took over the scoring
chores as the half ended, and the
Cats took an eight point lead into
the locker room.

Syracuse cut the gap to three
points with 11:28 to go, but Knight

Bannemten Fare Well
  At MSU

’ BY RICK STOUFFER

Lansing, Mich.--After impres-
sive victories at home against Kent
State and in the Pitt Invitational
plus a good showing at Cleveland
last week, the Pitt Tracksters met
the big boys head on in Lansing
and the Michigan State Relays and
showed they don't scare easily.

Pitttplaced 5th out of 25 schools I

including powerful Missouri and
Michigan State with a combined
point score of 13. Michigan State
was the big winner with 27 points
with the rest of .the field not far
behind.

Billy Rea, who holds the Field
House and meet record for the
MSU relays, took an easy first in
the long jump with a leap of
24’l0”. Once again, no compe-
tition was on hand to trouble Bill.

Coming right back after the win,
Billy triple jumped into a third
place ﬁnish with another no effort
try. Third place wasn't bad
considering he hadn't practiced for
three weeks.

Rick Weaver, Coach" Jim Ban-
ner's utility man, grabbed third in
the 600 yard run behind the
defending American record holder
Bob Cassleman of ‘Michigan State

and Dave Williams of Michigan.
“Weav" stayed right with the
leaders for a close third place
ﬁnish. ,

Tim Riley,‘ Pitt’s self-propelled
pogo stick, ﬁnished a close second
in the high jump leaping 6’10”.

game open. The 6-6‘/2 Braddock
senior popped in 14 points in a
five-minute span, and when it
ended, Pitt had a comfortable 62-46
lead.

Pitt began to lay back on offense
and as the eager Orange raced out
to challenge for the ball, the back
door. the side door, and even the
from door were all wide open.

The fans saw more openings
than the players did, but the
hoopers saw enough, and as
Knight and Hill converted easy
buckets, the fans went wild.

Prognosticators at the beginning
of the season said that Pitt could go
to the NIT with a 17-9 record. 20
wins would get the Cats into the
NCAA’s. With Cleveland State
and Youngstown next on the
schedule, things look pretty good
for an NCAA bid.

“I think we're pretty well set,"
said Ridl, knowing that the season
deﬁnitely will not end on March 2
when Pitt hosts West Virginia.
“We should get something.”

Rebounds--It was a third sellout of
the season...Students do not need
an exchange ticket for Thursday's
Cleveland State game...Tickets will
be needed for the Feb. 20 Temple
game (available starting Wednes-
day), and the March 2 West
Virginia game (available Feb.
25)...Resérved seats are already
gone for the WVU game...The
Golden Panthers are raffling off a
Vega at the Temple game.

  Grapplers Fall

BY G. W. STEVENS
“They didn't win this match, we

lost it." Those were the words of

Pitt wrestling coach Dave Adams
Saturday afternoon after he
watched his team blow a 9-0 lead,
losing to Lock Haven State College
19-18.

The.-Panthers, now 4-11, grabbed
their quick lead on the strength of
George Bryant's pin and Rande
Stottlemyer’s 7-4 decision. But the
squad couldn't maintain the lead as
they dropped the next five
matches. Pitt got two more
victories at 177 and 190 pounds,
but heavyweight Jim Shuster ‘s
14-8 decision over Pitt's Carl Roba
was just enough to give the visitors
their seventh vistory of the season.

“The match went just the way
we ﬁgured," said Lock Haven
coach Ken Cox. “It was decided by
the heavyweights. We were very
lucky, we won all the close
matches. Actually we were no
better than Pitt." '

Saturday’s match marked the
return of Pitt’s Bryant who has
been unable to get his weight down
to 118 pounds. He lost 14 pounds
this week to become eligible, but
he wasn't weakened at all by his
strict diet. His pin of Dave Shreck
in the third period raised-his record
to 5-0 and prompted Dr. Cox to call
him “the best 118 pound wrestler
in.the country.”

Bryant was forced to lose so
much weight this year because of
the outstanding wrestling of
freshman Stottlemyer (11-4). His
match with 126-pound freshman
Tim McCamley was a ﬁerce
struggle which Stottlemyer won in
the third period with a last minute
escape and takedown.

But after Pitt's opening surge
Lock Haven dominated the match.
Former PIAA champion Gary Walk
got his team started with a
hard-fought 4-2 victory over Pitt's
Bob Bailey (6-9). He was soon
followed by teammate George Way
who scraped out a 10-9 decision
over sophomore Jeff Weis. Weis
held an 8-7”lead after two periods
but couldn't hang on, and the
Panther lead was cut to only three.

Lock Haven grabbed the lead
with the very next match. Mark
Podroski, wrestling in his first
match as a Panther, was unable to
control powerful Dave Crowell
[13-6-3]. Crowell tossed his
overmatched opponent around the
match for three periods, unable to
catch him on his back. He was

Syracuse, and Knight had one of
his best games of the year. To get
them ready to play, Mangine
sacriﬁced classes and just about
everything else all week.

“I treated Mooney (Knight) three
times a day,” explained a happy

’ but weary Mangine. “He used the

whirlpool, dry heat, and a heating
pad; Right now, he's almost
completely recovered, although it's
a little sore right after the game.”
Martin received similar treatment
on his injured leg as Knight has on
his bruised shoulder. “We did the
same thing with Mickey as we did
with Mooney,” Mangine said (the
we including his assistant, Jay
Irrgang). “Mickey did a lot of
swimming later in the week, and
that helped a lot.” _

The rapid recovery of Martin

trainer despite being just a senior
here. “At first I thought he was
coming around sIow,”he admitted.

“But when I heard the doctors
talking about it, it was amazing
that he could play.”

Although Pitt should be able to
crush Cleveland State without
Martin, Mangine says Martin will
be able to play. Wishing to leave
the coaching decisions to Buzz
Ridl, Bobby. declined to comment
on whether it would be better for
Mickey to sit out Thursday's game.
Two other casualties from the Kent
State game, Bolla and Ken
Wagoner, are back at 100%. Bolla
hyper-extended his shoulder a-
gainst the Golden Flashes, but
heat treatments and swimming _
cured him. Wagoner twisted his
right ankle, but he responded to
heat treatment well, according to
Mangine.

Knight paid Mangine the
highest compliment when com-
paring him to trainers he has had in
the past. “Willie Myers was the
basketball trainer [and head
trainer] before Bobby, and he was
one of the best in the country,”
said Mooney. “Bobby studied
under Willie and uses all his
techniques. That's why I get back
into action sooner than everyone
expects.”

When basketball manager Tom
“Lefty” Booth learned that Man-
gine was the subject of an article,
he said, “Oh no, not Bobby.” “He

deserves one,” countered equip- lough.

Riley and Missouri's Gene Hans-
brough barely missed 7’%” on
three tries.

Pitt’s two-mile relay is fast
becoming one of the best in the

.country. Bob Steele, Tom Moore,

Rich Jackson, and Chuck Mozingo
ran a 7:36.5 to finish in second
place but with the distance medley
relay team [Jack Patrick, Wayne
Cooley, Rich Markley, and Nick
Martin] have run two of the fastest
times in the country this year.

The 300 yard dash featured
MSU's own Marshall Dill who set a
new meet, Field House, American,
and world record bettering his own
record 29.3 to 29.5.

"Herb Washington, another
Michigan Stater, who holds the
world record in the 60 yard dash
with 5.9 almost broke his 1972
record except four judges got- four

different times for the speedster'

with the average counting. Only
the night before in California
Washington had run a six flat. to
defeat record holder John Smith.

On the long bus ride home, a
very tired Banner seemed pleased
with his “Babies” showing.

“I am happy with what we did at
the meet. We accomplished what
we set out to do and that was to
qualify our relays for the nationals
(later this year in Detroit.)”_ The
competition was excellent with the
really beig powerhouse schools in
track competing.

“Everyone did a good job,"
Banner continued, “Rich Markley
(Pitt Invite’s most valuable runner)
needs a rest and Jackson is having
problems with his knee but other
than that, we're in pretty good
shape?’

One of the bright spots for
Banner was the hurdlers. With
Andre Harris still out with a bad
leg, all the hurdlers were fresh-'
men. “The freshmen did an

outstanding job. If Jay’s [Sharp-'

ley] blocks hadn’t slipped and J .C.
Floyd's leg wouldn’t have given.

out, they had a shot at the ﬁnals,”
Banner said.

With a big meet under their
belts, the Tracksters will take it
easy for a few days, then prepare
for the Ohio State Invitational to
battle the giants again.

Practically the entire track team
has bad colds with many running at
Michigan State sick. Most of the
team has qualified for the IC4A

It can be kind of demoralizing
when you know you're going to lose
before a meet begins. If you don't
think so just ask lg Perez's
gymnasts.

Going into Saturday's matchup
with Navy, on paper there was no
way they could win although the
ﬁnal, 154.9-118.75 wasn't bad.

\ “We didn't do well at all," Perez
said, “the guys were really nervous
and we got a lot of bad breaks.

With Don Stephenson not compet-
ing, we lost 15 points right there.”

Besides Stephenson, Gary Wolf
from the side horse had a bad wrist
and floor exercise man Mark Boyett
had an abdominal pull which he
couldn't tumble correctly.

“With three on the vault, four on
the parallel bar, and three on the
horizontal bar you can see we were
outmanned," Perez continued.

Perhaps one reason for the
nervousness was the fact the entire
team is made up of freshmen.
“The boys just hang in there trying
to beat their own scores. Morale is
really high despite the fact they
couldn't win."

If morale stays high when you're
losing, winning can't be too far
ahead.

Girapplers Fall Short

(Continued from Pa;/e 9)

Panthers had a lead, 18-16, and the
stage was set for the match which
would decide the contest.
Shuster jumped out to an early
lead of 9-0 using his huge frame to
muscle Roba around the mat. But
Roba kept pressuring his opponent
and was able to wear him down
enough to close the gap somewhat.

But Shuster has the big advantage
and simply held on enough to win
his match and gain the victory for
Lock Haven.

Pitt won't be in action again until
Saturday afternoon when they meet
Syracuse University at the Field
House. Their 4-11 record doesn’t
appear too impressive but Cox

doesn't feel that it tells the whole
story.

“Dave Adams is a great coach,"
he said. “We in the coaching
profession have a great deal of
respect for him and the job he’s
doing. What most people don't
realize is that he has about the
toughest schedule in the East. I'm
sure that he'll be able to get his
program back in shape."

Tankers Crush WVU

BY YAIER LEHRER

The West Virginia swim team
might just as well have stayed
home last Saturday as their
presence was hardly felt by an
overpowering Panther squad that
devoured the Mounties. 92-21 at
Trees Hall pool.

The Mountaineers could not put
much of anything together as they
wereionly able to muster one first
place out of the thirteen events.
while picking up three second

I’ places. The rest went to Pitt. and

even then some of the swimmers
who don't usually get a chance to
share the limelight with some of
the better known mermen.

Neil Wasserman won the 200-yard
individual medley with Mark
Winters and Dave Natali coming in
right behind him. Natali also swam
the 200-yard backstroke. an event
which he has never swum in a
college meet and won it ahead of
Jerry DeMuro. one of the swim-
mers who usually races in the

T distance free-style events.

“My divers really looked had,”
said Pitt diving cocach Al Coffey,
“But they looked at the divers
from West Virginia and really had
pity on them. They had one guy
diving for them who had only been
diving for four months.”

That was pretty much the story of

the whole meet. The West Virginia
fans sitting in the stands could
only root half-heartedly by the time
the meethad gone a short while and
they realized there was no hope.

There were some highlights to the
meet. though. as Jerry DeMuro
tried for and broke the team and
pool record in the 1650-yd
free-style. He swam and won the
1000-yd event, lapping the West
Virginia swimmer twice. but when
that was over the other swimmers
got out of the water as Jerry tried
for the record and a qualifying time
for the Easterns. Even the
Mountaineer fans were rooting for
him to do it. He broke the pool
record by 1:43 and also beat the
team mark set by now assistant
coach Fred Lewis.

Martin Staley looked better than
he has in a long time off the
one-meter board, capturing second
place to Tom Faytol’s first. Jack
Garrow won the three meter event,
beating the closest West Virginia
diver by a little over 144 points.
Second place went to Tom Faytol

who was only ten points behind
Garrow.

Mark Wallace did not swim in the
meet due to slight illness and John
Templin only swam in the medley
relay, giving way to Eric Wallace
who won the 200-yard breaststroke,
with Mark Winters picking up third
and Tom Curtis of West Virginia
nabbing one of the few second
places for his team.

“I think we should beat Syracuse
Saturday." said Coach Bradshaw,
“but I'm not so sure about Kent
State." It will be those meets that
will tell how well the team has been
rebuilt. The Mounties were just
practice for the Cats. The big ones
are yet to come.

For Men & Women

1814 Murray Ave.
Pittsburgh, Pa. 15217

BY KEVIN NOWE

The women's gymnastic’s team
was able to keep the mistakes and
faults to a minimum Saturday as it
scored an important victory in a
tri-meet with Edinboro and In-
diana. Pitt captured two first
places, three seconds and three
thirds, outscoring Indiana and
Edinboro 77.66 to 72.42 and 67.38.
respectively.

Donna DeMarino led the victory
with two first-place showings in the
floor exercise and vaulting events.
She also finished second in the
balance beam competition and
third on the uneven parallel bar.

In the floor exercise, DeMarino
executed a series of pivots and
jumps to near perfection. She
followed up with a combination of
front and side aerials, and finished
with back handspring leaps.
Indiana’s Sue Gibson finished
second, with Diane Bumgartner of
Pitt finishing third.

Pitt captured first and second
place in the horse vaulting.
DeMarino, competing for only the
second time this season, captured
first place with a score of 8.0.
Kathy Krynock of Pitt was close
behind in second, with a score of
7.95.

Krynock also finished second in
the uneven parallel bar competition
behind Edinboro's Debbie Haman.

Pitt Coach Debbie Wells felt the
victory was a most needed one and
would help the team's conﬁdence
tremendously. She noted the ﬁne

"performance of Sheila Barber.

Barber, with less than a year's

experience, finished third on the ,

balance beam.

Indiana coach Jupe Korab was
highly impressed ‘with the im-
provement of the Pitt squad. “The
artistic movements of each indi-
vidual, especially_Donna [De-
Marino], were extremely pretty
and graceful to say the least.”
Korab was not disappointed with
her own team’s performance
because this is their first year in
varsity competition.

Carol Portman, coach of Edinboro
stressed the desire of the Pitt team
as a factor in their recent victories.
“They cheer each other on. The
incentive is to win because
everybody else on the squad is out
to win." .

The victory evened the women’s
season record at 3-3. Their next
meet is Saturday, February 16,
against Fairmont State at Trees
Hall. Starting time for the meet is
1:30 pm.
