Pitt researchers discover possible cause of schizophrenia

By Jackie Estkowski.
stag Writer

Pitt researchers may have found the
cause of one-fifth of all schizophrenia
cases. .

An antibody that Pitt researchers have
discovered may be a primary factor in
some cases of schizophrenia. According
to Dr. Bruce Rabin, director of
immunopathology at Pitt’s School of
Medicine, antibodies in the immune system
which fight infection may mistake areas of

the body as foreign. When this occurs, the

campus safety issues were among the first to learn
of a new “van—call” service that could be operational

by the end of the week.

“We’ve reviewed the [current] shuttle systems,
and they’re pretty inefﬁcient,” SGB President Brent

Saunders said.

According to Saunders, the new van-call system
would consist of two vans equipped with cellular
phones. Upon implementation of the service,
students would be able to summon a van that
would safely deliver them to any location within a

certain range of the campus.

Saunders said thevans are only a temporary
solution to the campus safety problem.

Director of the Department of Public Safety
William Brennan said he has talked to
representatives of the Chrysler Corporation about
renting the vans. Saunders said that if the cellular
phones could be acquired by this morning, phone
‘numbers for the service would be available for
publication in The Pitt News by Thursday.

Saunders said he would try to get the shuttle to

Education key toﬁgbting racism

By Bruce Boul
For The Pitt News

Education was the. main

“message in an open forum on

discrimination presented by
Students Against Racism in .the

‘William Pitt Union last night.

Representatives from the Black
Action Society, Campus Women’s
Organization and the Bisexual,
Gay and Lesbian Alliance made
up a panel that led the question-
and—answer session.

According to Justin Laing,
deputy chairperson of the BAS,
most blacks grow up with blacks,
and most whites grow up with
whites.

“The problem begins when they
go to college because they can’t

f understand each other. We need

‘to take action, and action follows
easier when you are concerned
and get involved,” he said.

. Laing said the David Dukes of
the world are not the real threat.
“The George Bushes are the ones
who bring people in to speak

about population control,” Laing
said.

He said people need to watch
out for discriminatory programs,
not individuals. “As long as we’re
paying taxes, we’re paying for
those programs in the end.”

Dee Tervel, a first-year student
from New York, said people
wer'are not getting anywhere by
voﬁng.

“Violence is the answer; we

need to break everything down

and start over,” he said.
Laing disagreed with Tervel and

said violence will not solve

anything.

"You would have to kill a whole
social status, and that wouldn’t
be the answer,” said Todd
Kinavey, a BiGALA member.

According to Kinavey, gays
experience a very different kind
of discrimination because it is
legally tolerated in most parts of
the country.

“We’re invisible" because it
seems more legitimate to be
homophobic,” he said.

Researchers

CWO co—President Gina
McFarlin said discrimination
encompasses many groups.

“It is important to accept that it
is a part of our society,” she
added.

According to McFarlin, a Pitt
professor once said he hated
women and they wouldn’t pass
his class unless they played by
his rules.

"People in the administration
know that discrimination exists,”
McFarlin said. “We need to come
together cohesively to stop it,”
she added.

In looking for solutions to these
problems, Laing said people need
to educate themselves. “People
need to remember we are
students, and we need to read
stuff other than what were
assigned to read,” he said.

McFarlin also urged people to
educate themselves.

“Don’t bash women’s rights.
Pick up a book, join discussions
and take classes on these
subjects,” McFarlin said.

are unsure why

immune system attacks the body and
causes tissue breakdown.

“It’s like what officials called friendly
fire in the Gulf war,” said Dr. Rohan
Ganguli, associate professor of psychiatry
and pathology. “Areas of the body are
attacking each other just like the military
shooting down their own men.”

Out of 270 schizophrenia patients studied
at P_itt, approximately 20 percent suffer
from the autoimmune disease. Pitt
researchers have also found antibodies

attacking the hippocampus, a part of the
brain vital to memory and perceptions, in
about 60 patients. Rabin said the effect
causes disorganized thoughts characteristic
of schizophrenics. ’

One percent of the population suffers
from schizophrenia.

“There are very few theories connected
with how schizophrenia comes about,”
Ganguli said. “We’re testing one of a few
theories which would affect a small portion
of the schizophrenic population, but it’s a
promising finding.”

autoimmunity occurs, he said. “It may be
from a chemical imbalance or genetic
defect, but we just don’t know for sure,”
Ganguli said.

Because researchers are still gathering
information, treatments for autoimmunity
are not yet being proposed, Rabin said.
“We’re in the fifth year ofa grant and have
two more years to work on the project';” he
said. ‘‘In that time we hope to develop a
treatment that will modify the immune
system.” B

midshipman told an officer
DeGuia said he was gay.

“Whydid he want to play God?”
DeGuia said about the other
midshipman. “He made a decision
for someone else, and I don’t feel
that was right.”

DeGuia’s scholarship was
revoked and he was asked to see
a psychiatrist “tO obtain an analysis
of [his] sexual orientation.”

He considered the evaluation
but ultimately refused it. “This is
who I am. I don’t need someone
else to tell me,” he said.

DeGuia doesn’t think he’ll have
to pay back his scholarship
money. “My ROTC adviser said, if
I don’t give them any trouble, I'll
be Off the hook.”

A lawyer from the American
Civil Liberties Union and another
student who had been dismissed
from ROTC advised DeGuia not
to sue the Department of Defense.

“They said if you go through
legal action, it won’tgo anywhere
 I’m glad they told me not to go
through with it,” he said. ‘‘I want

to learn. I’m here for college, not
to go through legal action. Legal
action would hurt so many people
in ROTC and I don’t think I’d feel
comfortable outing myself to my
friends back home.”

Suing the military would also
bring him unwanted attention,
he said.

“I don’t think I'm ready to tell
the whole world. It’s like being
naked to the whole nation. You’re
being scrutinized  People are
watching you. It doesn’t give you
any space for a private life, or a
privilege to sit back and reflect.”

He is adamant about working
against discrimination in the
military, but ‘fl don’t want to do
anything to hurt ROTC.” And he
doubts that his case could make
a great difference. “They’ve been
doing this before  This is just
one more mark on the score
sheet”

DeGuia, 20, is a sophomore
majoring in history and social-

‘decision science. He said he hasn’t

been harassed On campus at all.

me. I’m sure if they did do that,
ROTC would have a bad name,"
he said.

DeGuia said few students know
that he is the student who was
disenrolled, but “I’m sure some
are pointing fingers.”

Although he still supports the
ROTC, he said the recent write-in
campaign which elected 10 ROTC
students to the student senate
was “stupid.” The unprecedented
number of ‘write-ins came after
ROTC students felt threatened by
a senate resolution condemning
ROTC. “You can write someone
in if it’s only for an issue. But after
the issue dies, that person has no
purpose being there,” he said.

He said he isn’t sure how he
feels about leaving ROTC. “That
was a question I’m still going
through. Even now there’s times
when I envy the freshman cadets
in their excitement. I wish I could
take part of that again.”

He found his time spent in the
military to be valuable but said
he"‘really, [didn't] know whether
I would have signed on” in the

end.

It was hard for DeGuia to
reconcile being gay and being in
the military. “Things were split
up. I had my ROTC life and I had
my gay life  And there were few
times they mixed.” But he thought
that he “shOuldn’t have to be
doing this sneaking around” in
hiding his sexual orientation.

His parents have been
somewhat supportive, DeGuia
said, “acknowledging ‘I have a
son,’ but not ‘I have a gay son.”’

DeGuia’s father is a retired Navy
chief petty officer who still is
hopeful that his son will rejoin
the military.

“When he calls  sometimes
he says, ‘You’ll just be in Army
ROTC next.”’ And DeGuia isn't
sure if his father is serious.

Despite the strain of being
disenrolled from the ROTC
program, DeGuia is confident that

his case is “getting a lot Of people
to ask the government to re-
evaluate” the policy prohibiting
gays in the military. “Life is just
starting,” he said. '

For The Pitt News

Clare McShane ﬁdgeted and
didn’t look the questioner in the
eye when she discussed a grade
she thought was unfair.

She received a poor midterm
grade in a class based on two
tests. This junior in the College of
Arts and Sciences refused to talk
specifics but admitted to being
ill—prepared. She said her
professor encouraged her, saying
her final grade would be based
largely on her ﬁnal test and overall
improvement.

She worked hard. Taking his
words seriously, she aced the
final exam. She went directly to
the professor when the grade on
her transcript reflected her
midterm grade. He refused to
change the grade, saying she
received what she deserved. She
was embarrassed.

‘‘I felt more stupid than the
grade he gave me,” McShane
said.

She is relatively unique in her
questioning of a professor. She is
in the absolute majority in that
she took the issue no further.

Students who think instructors

Associate Dean of CAS Gene
Deskins said the number of
complaints that reach his office is
very low.

In serious cases his office would
form a committee of faculty
members in related ﬁelds to act
as an intermediary between the
student and instructor, he said.
The committee’s authority would
extend as far as a strong
recommendation, but the
instructor has the final word.

“Enrolling in the class establishes -

a contract between the student
and the instructor,” Deskins said.
He speaks of a grade being

simply an approximation, “a ﬁckle '

creature.” He raises his hand to
his chin and leansback slightly as
he warms to the subject. He uses
large words. He dislikes the
concept of grading and the
implications of attempting to
measure knowledge.

conflict is technical rather than
subjective.

“If its an isolated incident with
a faculty member, it often comes
down to a miscommunication,”
said Deskins said.

He sees most problems being
resolved between the teacher and
student on a personal level.

So does Dr. Phil Smith, chair of
the English department. He
reiterates the instructor’s ultimate
authority but acknowledges from
personal experience that opinions
can be swayed by the consensus
opinion of a committee.

“If a panel recommends a
change in grade, the professor

may see this as something to
agree to,” Smith said.

Conflict rarely gets as far as the
committee stage, he said. He
recalls only two incidents in the
past few years.

One explanation for the scarcity
of dispute may be found in
satisfaction.

Statistics compiled by the FAS
administration concerning spring
term (90—91) grades show
surprisingly few poor grades.
More than 70 percent of all CAS
students received a grade ofC or
better—— failures and withdrawals
account for only 6.9 percent ofall
final grades.

.. Few university students contest low grades

offers another possibility. This is
her first semester in the United
States, having taught for five years

at an Australian university. She .

notices a difference in student
attitudes.

“People [at Pitt] seem to be
extremely obedient,” said Krips.

She said her authority as an
instructor was questioned more
by Australian students. Krips said
it was rather common at the
university level for students to
ask that their assignments be
reviewed. She once changed a
grade based on further review,
butshe doesn’t see that happening
at Pitt.

Q

 

Evaluating the response

The “safety on campus” issue has gotten the entire
university community into an uproar. Scared students are
upset and fearing for their lives walking from their homes
to campus at night, or vice-versa. Willam Brennan,
director of the Department of Public Safety, has been
 us  runaround. The Student -Government Board,
fortunlately. has taken the iniziative in an attempt to solve
 problems   .

At last night’s SGB meeting, Brennan claimed that a
report in the Nov. 19 issue of The Pitt News regarding the
actual numbers of security personnel was inaccurate. In
fact, Brennan himself supplied the information printed in

the article, which contradicted his first statement last

week that there were actually 100_ security personnel.
When questioned by a concerned studentin the audience,
Brennan said that his original report was correct, but
further inquisition by SGB President Brent Saunders only
confused those in attendance even more. It is imperative
that the university community be informed of the actual

_ number of patrolling oﬂicers on the Pin‘ campus. We must

have knowledge of these inadequate numbers so that a
change can be made as soon as possible. This runaround
and indecisiveness in the Department of Public Safety
must come to a stop. Our safety should no longer be
placed in jeopardywhile Brennan dances around questions
and never gives a complete or non-contradictory answer.
The Student Government Board and its public-safety
committee should be applauded for their action on this
topic. With the concern given to various projects by board
members, Pitt students can expect the arrival of a Pitt Taxi
by the end of the week. It will contain a cellular phone to
which students can call and be picked up or dropped off
between operating hours. That phone number will be
available to the community by Thursday of this week-.
An escort service similar to those used at several other
universities across the United States will also. be looked
into. However such a» project takes time, research and
funding which may not be available for the immediate
future. It is hoped that an adequate escort service will be
made available to students within the next semester.
Usually, SGB meetings are held in the SGB office, but
due to an expectedly large turnout, the meeting was
moved , to a conference room on the fifth ﬂoor of the
William Pitt Union. It is refreshing to see that students are
ﬁnally taking a stand for their rights and attending
meetings. Safety is not a “bandwagon,” nor should this
situation become a “fad.” The Pitt News urges students to
take initiative and confront SGB members with their ideas
and input as to how to make Pitt a safer place to live. We
do not expect a complete reversal overnight, but a sig-
niﬁcant change in the welfare of Pitt's students is mandatory.
It is a tragedy that it took the violation of one of our
fellow students to motivate this generally apathetic campus.

Police max

I am sick and tired of hearing
about the alleged inadequacies
of the campus police. Common
sense dictates that it would be a
practical impossibility to station
officers on every corner in
Oakland for the purpose of
protecting every defenseless
person who chooses to be out
late at night. I wonder if these

. people who constantly whine for

better security ever visited Pitt
before attending. I dare say that
most people who visit the school

easily assume that it is not the

safest place in the world.

The Pitt campus combines two
of the highest crime areas in the
nation, namely the inner city and
the college campus. Given these
facts, I believe that the campus
police are doing a ﬁne job,
especially when one considers
the relatively small number of
serious crimes that occur here.
Typical of the Pitt attitude,
students cry for the university to
provide more security, regardless
of cost, rather than choosing the
cheaper and more efficient
method of banning together. A
student-run escort service could
be easily implemented by the
SGB, provided of course that all
of the people who claim to be
concerned with campus safety
got involved S

[...l. Oakland will never be
crime-free regardless o'f“‘**-«show

many police officers are hired,

and only through student
involvement will crime be cut. If
you want to live in fantasy land,
transfer to Penn State.

‘Hotel Iothrop’amusing

I read witty Ed Kichline on
“Hotel Lothrop" (Pitt News, Nov.
14, 1991) with sympathy and a
chuckle. Now it's my turn to be
amusing. I know comparisons
are odious, but indulge me. I
graduated from an Ivy league
college in 1942, having lived in
the same dorm room in a 3-ﬂoor
dorm(wirhnolounge, nokitchen)
forfouryears. Aclually,minewas
a layout for three students, with

eqolcies

Letters

sizable living room and two 5’x8'
bedrooms (one with bunk beds).
1 furnished my own desk, two
chairs, lamp, typewriter, mattress
and bedding, period. We had no
sink, radio, phone or TV. My
ﬂoor accommodated 18 young
men in eight varied room setups;
we had one toilet per ﬂoor (two
commodes, two sinks, two
showers). We graduated into
World ‘War II, during which my
room was sometimes — not
always — worse. Admittedly, that
was back in the dark ages, and

my dorm rent was only $180 per
year. .

The article “Pitt official injured
after brawl” featured front page
Tuesday, Nov. 12, 1991, illustrates
the lack of journalistic style and
ethics The Pitt News has. Most of
the alleged people involved in
that incident had their names
mentioned. Needless to say, all
of those said to be involved were
black, and the contents of the
article portrayed a negative black
image. .-

The black population is very
small on this campus, which
makesindentifyingblackstudents
ve‘i'yv  It seems the name
dropping might.have been an
attempt to shame orslander those
mentioned in the article. T1JePtrt
News has proved itself sensitive
to the issues that concern mainly
white students by withholding
names. Why couldn't The Pitt
Newswithhold names in Friday's
article?

Furthermore, a police report is
not always guaranteed to contain
accurate information or a
complete report of occurrences.
Therefore in order for David T.
Welch to accurately report this
incident as fact, his presence or

necessary.

exaggerated

Pitt News owes some people
an apology. Not just the people
mentioned in the article nor the
black campus community but all
of your readers. You have given
them misleading information. It
was untrue, inaccurate and
showed no journalistic talent. Pitt
News, gossip and rumors are not
news. ‘Writing and presenting facts
of descriptions of events without

an attempt at interpretation is

news .

Living in ‘La-La-land’

Has Ed Kichline recently
returned from La-La-Land? His
editorial, “Nuclear weapons
necessary to prevent war,”
borders on the absurd. He first
argues that proper management
of nuclear proliferation can
minimize the likelihood of nuclear
war. l...l

Kichline then presents absence
of war in Europe as evidence that
nuclear arms prevent hot war. He
misses the point! The reality of
the cold war is that the two
superpowers fought most of the
hotpartinthethirdperson Coupe,
full-scale revolution, ass-
assinations, electiormfigging and

terroristic acts were all either

facilitated, funded or covertly
performed by both superpowers
— never mind the many
oppressive and murderous
puppet governments handled by

-both. Generally, third-world

nations have felt the hot end of
the poker for the past four

decades, and theyare the real ,

losers.
Whattheworldmustleamfrom

PITT HOOPS, THE Pl'I'l' NEWS, Wednesday, November 20,» 1991

Miller assumes leadership role on Pitt squad 4.

By Brandy L. Simms
Staﬁ“ Writer

Brian Shorter, Darelle Porter,
Bobby Martin, Jason Matthews
and Sean Miller all comprised
Pitt’s most ballyhooed recruiting
class. As seniors, Shorter, Porter,
Martin and Matthews helped the
Panthers construct a 21-12 record,
including an NCAA tournament
appearance, their third in four
years under head coach Paul
Evans.

Now that they’ve moved on,
Miller remains as the lone
holdover to that 1987 recruiting
class that never quite lived up to
expectations. After missing the
1989-’90 season with an ankle
injury, he returned last year and
averaged IO./I points and /1.8
assists per game. Now he’s back
to provide some experience for a
team that’s for the most part
lacking it.

“Well,” Miller said, “since we
have a lot of young guys, I think
[my] role is just to keep everyone
focused from game to game.
We're going to have some ups,
and we’re gonna have some
downs.”

As a first-year player Miller
averaged 9.3 points per game
and displayed the poise and court
acumen ofa senior by helping to
lead the Panthers to the Big East
regular—season championship. He
started all but foumgames that,
year and -led the team in assists
(180),,.'free throw percentage

(.851) and three—point field goals
(58).

That year he also set a school
record for assists by a first-year
player and for consecutive free
throws made (34). In a game
against St. Francis he set another
record by converting six three-
pointers. For his outstanding first-
year antics, the league coaches
selected him as the Big East
Freshman of the Year.

During Miller’s sophomore year
he started in all 30 games and led
the team in minutes played
(1,051). He averaged 9.7 points
and dished out 181 assists while
recording only 82 turnovers.
When it comes to free-throw
shooting, there aren’t too many
better than Miller, who in three
years has only missed 25 foul
shots.

I-‘rom three—point range, he’s
no slouch, either. During the span
of his career Miller has converted
182 three~point field goals or 42
percent of his attempts. Each year
he has gotten better in virtually
every phase of the game. “He’s
improved his penetration, his
strength, his shooting [and] ball
handling,” Evans said. “There
hasn’t been too many areas he
hasn’t improved in.”

The Panthers have advanced
to the NCAA tournament every
year that Miller has been at the
helm. The 6-foot, 1-inch, 185-
pound ....seni.or _.Captain is
undoubtedly the leader of this

year’s group. He’ needs just 79

points to become the 22nd player

in Pitt’s history to reach the 1,OO0- ,

point mark and is only 98 assists
away from breaking Porter’s all-
time assist record.

Last year’s team was loaded
with talent, depth and experience,
but the 1991 Pitt team isloaded
with inexperience. No less than

half of the players on this year’s -

squad are first—year players or
sophomores, but even though
most publications have picked
the Panthers to finish in the
league’s bottom half, Evans still
believes that his troops can

compete in what many consider ’

to be the nation’s premier
conference.

‘‘I don’t think you ever go into
a season — at least we don’t —
looking at it as a rebuilding year,”
Evans said. “We still think that if

the kids play good defense and—

play hard, that we can play with
most of the teams in the Big East."

Before, there was Martin,
Shorter, Porter and Matthews to
carry the load. Now Miller has to
assume the leadership role. Not
only will he be expected to
penetrate defenses and work the
ball inside, but he’ll also be

expected to increase his point 4

production as well.

“I think they’ll be looking for
me to shoot the ball more,” he
said, “whereas before I was the
point guard, just content with
getting the ball to "the other
players.”

Morningstar leader in inexperienced Panther frontcourt

By Cory Walbom
Staﬂ Writer

- With the departure of Brian
Shorter and Bobby Martin, the
pieces ofPitt’s depleted frontcourt
rest on the shoulders of Darren
Morningstar, a senior center intent
On holding those pieces together.

Morningstar, who nearly

, doubled his production in scoring

and rebounding last year, is
confident the Panthers’ frontcourt
will be solid. . _
“I think we are.just as good
inside as we were last year,”
Morningstar said. “Chris [McNeal]

and I will have to up our point’

production, but Eric [Mobley] will
be good on defense.”

All three will have to play
extremely hard to replace the
talents of Shorter and Martin.
Morningstar said he feels that
goal can be accomplished. He
has worked hard this summer to
assure his senior year will be his
best.

“I have made great progress
this summer. Lifting weights and

had to sit out the Panthers’ 1989-
’90 season. The time off is what
Morningstar did not like. “It is
hard to come back after a year
layoff,” Morningstar said.

Going into his sophomore year,
Morningstar was virtually
unknown to many Pitt fans. But
he managed to play in all 29
games that season. Morningstar
was the first big man to come off
the bench and a part—time starter.

He averaged 3.8 points per
game and ended up with a total
of 82 rebounds. '

His reserve role gave Pitt head
coach Paul Evans a reliable player
off the bench, a role Morningstar
would also play in his junior
year

Playing behind center Bobby
Martin, Morningstar got more
playing time his junior year
because Martin was hampered
by injuries. Starting in 11 games
and playing in all 33, Morningstar
doubled his point production to
6.8 ppg. His rebounds also
increased to 133 for the season.

His best performance last

running have put me in the best
shape I’ve been in,” Morningstar
said.

Shaping up, the 6—foot, 10-inch
Morningstar put on 10 pounds
and is now weighing in at 235.
Morningstar and sophomore
newcomer Eric Mobley (6-1 1, 235
pounds) should give the Panthers
a formidable duo in the paint. It
is within the paint that Morningstar
first gained basketball stardom.

Averaging 35 points and 17
rebounds a game at Stevenson
High School, Morningstar became I
a two-time all-state center and
earned Washington State Player
of the Year honors as a senior. He
also tallied a career total of 1,800
points while at Stevenson.

Morningstar first took his talents
to Navy. After playing five games
for the Midshipmen, he decided
to transfer to Pittsburgh. ,

“I wanted to play in the best
conference in the country, so I
chose the Big East,” Morningstar
said about his decision to transfer
to Pitt.

With the transfer, Morningstar

season came against Providence.
Morningstar Scored a career-high
21 points and had 9 rebounds in
Pitt’s victory over the Friars. He
also had a career—high 13
rebounds against UCLA.
Gaining experience from both
his junior and sophomore
seasons, Morningstar will be the
only big man with such
experience on this young Panther
squad. His inside play will be

‘ very Crucial to the team’s success.

Morningstar feels it is too early
to say how the team will do this
season. “We’re performing fairly
well in practice,” he said. “We are
a young team that needs game
experience.”

That game experience will
come soon enough and against
several talented Big East teams.
Morningstar knows Pitt’s
frontcourt will be tested by every
conference team. “Every team in
the Big East has a good
frontCourt,” Morningstar said.
“Everyone has a lot of good moves
under the hoop.”

Morningstar pointed out St.

John’s University’s big men,
Robert Werdann and Malik Sealy,
as the toughest players to face
under the basket. Alonzo
Mourning of Georgetown was
his second choice.

Controlling these opponents is
a high priority for Morningstar as
well as Pitt.

It is Morningstar who will take
the brunt of the Big East’s inside
attack. If Morningstar, Mobley,
junior Chris McNeal and first-
y_ear forward Orlando Antigua
control the paint, than the
Panthers’ season looks bright.

Bright is the way Morningstar
wants it. He is a senior and wants
to go out a winner. ‘‘I want to go
Out with a bang,” Morningstar
said. “I want our team to do real
well. That’s more important than
my personal achievements.”

This year Morningstar is focused
on team-Oriented goals. He wants
to do his best for the team. “I
would like our team to get to the
NCAA tournament,” he said. “You
have the most fun when you win,
of course.”

Mobley brings dunk back to Fitzgerald Field House

By Jason Hillman
Photography Editor

After a two-and-a-half—year
wait, Eric Mobley finally
introduced himself to the Pitt
community on Nov. 6,
approximately 12 minutes into
the game. He smashed home his
first dunk as a Panther. And it
definitely wasn’t his last.

“I look for a dunk faster than I
look for two points,” admitted
Mobley, who attempted at least
a half a dozen‘ more in the two
exhibition games this year. “It
feels like you’re letting off some
type of anger. It might pick the
team up if you get a dunk.”

Mobley, a 6—foot, 11-inch
sophomore, was recruited by
Pitt as early as 1988. He averaged
20.3 points, 11.7 rebounds and
6.5 blocks a game during his
senior season at Salesian High
School and made a verbal
commitment on Feb. 1, 1989, his
19th birthday. He was one of five
recruits that year who looked to
be one of the best in Pitt’s history:
Jamal Faulkner was ranked as
one of the top 12 schoolboy
players in the country; Chris
McNeal was top 50 and Mobley
and Danny Griffen were top 150.
All five were declared ineligible

due to their SAT scores.

Faulkner is now at Arizona
State and won Pac-10 Freshman
of the Year honors. Griffen is
going to play for UNLV this year.
McNeal and Dominic Dumancic,
the ﬁfth recruit, are already at
Pitt.

“I’m glad it’s over with, ” Mobley
said. “Finally I can go out here
and play some Big East basketball.
I’m real happy that I’m here at
Pitt.”

“We worked very hard to get
him,” said Pitt assistant coach
John Sarandrea, who recruited
Mobley. “I’ve known him since
he was in the ninth grade, when
I was a high—school coach in New
York City. I guess all good things
you have to wait for, and he’s
finally here.”

After being declared ineligible,
Mobley enrolled at Allegheny
(Md.) Commu nity College, where

he played with Pitt forward’

Antoine Jones. He averaged 16.4‘
points and 10.5 rebounds a game.
He played only one year of junior-
college ball because he wanted
two solid years in a major college
program. “It will always take you
one year to get adjusted to the big

school,” Mobley said, “and then ,
you have only one year left. I -

didn’t want that. Nowl have two

years to really work hard.”

Over the summer Mobley
worked out with the Boston
Celtics. “Itwas a good experience,
seeing how the pros work out,”
Mobley said. “At the Celtics’ camp,
I ﬁgured that they are all superstars
and that they were just going to
hog the ball and not give me a
chance because I’m not getting
paid. But it was different. I felt
real comfortable around them.”

Only 205 "pounds when he was
recruited, Mobley blew up to 270
pounds this spring. He has since
dropped to 235. “That’s a good
weight for him,” said head coach
Paul Evans.

‘.‘He’s 30 pounds heavier and
probably twice as strong as he
was,” Sarandrea said, “and he
hasn’t lost any quickness.”

Mobley’s greatest problem right
now is the fact that he hadn’t
played organized basketball in
nearly a year and a half until
practice started this season.

“First week of practice we
weren’t sure if he’d ever play
here,” said assistant coach Mark

Coleman. “Now he’s starting to
look like he could play in the
NBA someday. It’s tough to come
back after a year and a half of not
playing organized basketball. It’s
been a long, hard struggle for
him. He's coming through,
though. Every day he does
something better. Every day he
progresses.”

“He was real out of shape and
real rusty,” Evans said. “He’s only
played a couple of months in the
last two years. It’s going to take
some time.”

“The practices went real well,”
Mobley said. “I heard somebody
comment, saying thatCoach Evans

V is real happy with the attitudes

that we have this year. It seems
like everyone wants to play and
everyone’s willing to learn. I-le’s
having a lot of fun coaching us
right now.”

Having a physical player like
Darren Morningstar, who is a Big
East veteran, often playing
opposite him in practice is helping
Mobley adjust.

“He’s talking to me and letting

me know what I'm supposed to‘
do,” Mobley said about
Morningstar. “I watch him in
practice, and then when I get in,
I make sure I do the same things
he was doing. I like the physical
game anyway, so it doesn'tbother
me that [Morningstarl’s physical,
but that keeps me concentrated.”

In the first exhibition game
Mobley played 12 minutes ina
reserve role and had 13 points
and eight rebounds.

“I felt real good as far as not
being tired,” said Mobley after
the first exhibition game. “But it
was only 12 minutes. So I don’t
really feel that rusty.

“I knew I wasn’t going to play
a lot. [Evans] wanted me to get
used to the system. He’s not
trying to throw me out there. He’s
giving me a little playing time at
a time so I can pick up on what’s
going on,” he said.

“I thought [Mobley] played '

very well,” Coleman said. “He

didn’t try to do a lot of things he

couldn’t do. It was good, I think,

Enthusiasm product of Antigua’s environment

By Rob Pugliese

V Sta_[f Writer

Say the word “emotional,” and
the phrase “Pitt basketball player”
does not immediately jump to
mind. However, Orlando Antigua
is not your typical first-year player.

Pitt fans should expect to see a
fiery, enthusiastic player when
Antigua steps into the arena.

“l’ll be outthere hustling, talking

to a lot ofplayers, and you might

see me getemotional,” he said. “I
get very emotional when I’m on
the court.”

The 6—foot, 7-inch forward from
the Bronx, N.-Y., works hard at all
aspects of the game. Ile brings a
combination of intense defense,
savvy, court smarts, a winning
attitude and a relentless work
ethic to a team that has lacked

these attributes in the past.

“He’s an excellent defensive
player,” Pitt assistant coach john
Sarandrea said. ‘‘He’s got long
arms, quick feet, good basketball
sense and good athletic ability.
The two things he’s gonna do
best are really run the floor and
hustle and his defense.”

Last season Antigua and St.
Raymond’s High School won the
New York Catholic League
Championship.

Antigua was a three—year starter
for Coach Gary DeCesare and
became a dominant player,
averaging I5 points, eight
rebou nds and three blocked shots
his senior year. For his career, he
scored over 1,000 points and
finished as St. Raymond’s second-
leading all-time scorer. Antigua
was named New York All-City,

second—team Parade All-
American and McDonald’s All-
American. He made his Pittsburgh
debut in April’s Dapper Dan
Roundball Classic.

DeCesare influenced Antigua’s
life very deeply. “My high—school
coach was one of my idols
growing up because he looked
out for me, helped me out with a
lot of things besides basketball,
and I really thank him for it,”
Antigua said.

Antigua chose to continue his
career at Pitt because it had the
right combination of things he
was looking for and because he
had a positive feeling about
playing for Pitt head coach Paul
Evans.

‘‘I felt it was the best place for
me,” Antigua said. “It wasn’t too
far away from home. I like the

way Coach Evans is, how he gets
on you. Even though some players
might not like getting screamed
at, I need that to motivate me
sometimes when I’m not awake.”

He said he wanted to get away
from New York badly but still
wanted to stay in a city
environment.

“I like to be around people,
and I couldn’t see myself being
out in a university out in some
countryside or something like
that,” he said. “Sol needed to be
around the city atmosphere, but
I just had to get away from New
York.”

In high school, Antigua played
primarily center and was a post-
up player. At Pitt he has had to
adjust to playing the “three” spot,
small forward.

He said he realizes that he’ll
need to work hard with ball
handling and outside shooting,

but his enthusiasm and work‘

ethic should compensate.

“I’m still making a lot of
turnovers and a lot of mistakes
that should get corrected by me
just gaining experience and
playing against Gandhi and when
Antoine comes back,” Antigua
said.

He said that most of the
mistakes are strictly from
inexperience and his unfamiliarity
with playing outside and making
decisions: knowing when to pass
and knowing when to shoot,

knowing when to dribble and

when not to.

“I just gotta keep working on
that,” Antigua said, “and that’s
just gonna come through
repetition and practicing.”

“Because of the hustle, I think
you’re going to see him get a lot
of extra points on garbage
baskets, follows on missed shots
and just flat—out desire, ” Sarandrea
said.

Hitting the perimeter jump
shot wasn’t something Antigua
needed to do at St. Raymond’s,
but he is working very hard to
improve this aspect of his game.

“With somebody with the work
ethic that he has, I don’t think
there’s-any problem with thefact
that he’s going to become a very,
very good shooter,” Sarandrea
said. “He’s already got excellent
form; it’s just a matter of him
becoming comfortable facing the
basket. He’1l put the effortin, and
he’ll get comfortable a lot quicker
than somebody else might.”

Evans said he sees the same
effort and determination and is
pleased with Antigua’s progress
thus far.

“He has done real well,” Evans
said. “He’s a good fundamental
player. He comes from a good
high school with a good coach
who has taught him the skills he
needs.” '

Antigua’s strengths should
come to the forefront with Pitt
implementing an up—tempo style
both on offense and defense. His
tenacious defense should have a

Gandhi Jordan and Chris
McNea1 have been teammates for
a long time -— here at Pitt and
when they were roommates at
Oak Hill Academy in Virginia.
They were members of one of
high—school basketball’s best
teams at Oak Hill; a team that
finished its season 22-2 and
ranked 11th in the nation by USA
Today.

But this year McNeal andJordan
are among the veterans that are
expected to lead a youthful Pitt
team.

Both players saw their first
collegiate action last year, but
neither has ever started a game.
Now they are being looked to for
leadership as well as production.

Jordan, a 6—foot, 6-inch
sophomore, brings many skills to
the Pitt team. While seeing time
at small forward last year, Jordan
finished tied for fourth on the
team with 10 three—pointers in
just 182 minutes of action. He

spot

Due to Antoine Jones’ foot ,

injury, Jordan has seen significant
time at small forward in the
Panthers’ exhibitions. ButJordan
will play wherever he is needed.
“This is my first time playing
‘two’,” Jordan said. “At the two-
guard, you shoot more in this
offense, and I like to shoot. But
just as long as I'm out there, I’m
comfortable." A

He will have to see more time
at the small forward position until
Jones’ return, which may not be
for another month. ‘‘If you look,
we have Orlando [Antigua],
Jermaine [Morgan] and myself at
that spot,” Jordan said, “and I’ll
have to play a lot until Antoine
comes back because of the
inexperience of those guys.”

Jordan’s introduction to college
basketball started out with a bang
but finished rather silently. He
scored 10 points and grabbed six

H—_19._______________..____..—_____—
Sidelined Jones waits for opportunity to contribute

By Brian Gallagher
Staﬂ" Writer

For most Pitt basketball players,
the past month of preseason
training has been filled with
intense conditioning,- ball-
handing drills and countless hours
of scrimmaging. For senior

_ Antoine Jones, however, the last

month of activity has consisted of
little more than toe lifts, mnning
in a swimming pool and free-
throw shooting.

While playing a pickup game
over the summer, Jones broke a
small bone off his big left toe.
Originally thought to be an

insignificant injury, the piece of
bone has remained lodged beside
the remaining bone. The two
bones rubbing together have been
a source of substantial discomfort
to the 6-foot, 7-inch forward from
Baltimore, Md., as well as a
wrench in head coach Paul Evans’
starting lineup.

In the midst of rehabilitation,
Jones remains optimistic about
the injury. “I can’t get down_ on
this [injury] because it’s still early
[in the yearl,”Jones said. “It’s one
of those nagging—type injuries
where you feel good one day,
and the next day it’s sore.”

Primarily used last season for

PI'I'I‘ HOOPS, THE PI'IT NEWS, Wednesday, November 20, 1991

his solid defense and rebounding,
Jones averaged S. 5 points and 2.8
rebounds in the games in which
he started.

Concerning his return to action,
Jones explained that the injury is
such that a return date can’t be
pinpointed. “It’s hard to say when
I’ll be back,” Jones said, “but I'll
probably be back in a month.”

While expressing a positive
attitude about the severity of the
injury and the long layoff from
practice, Jones was perplexed at
the nature of such an injury. "‘I
never thought Ia time-Consuming
injury] would be something like a
broken toe or something like

that,” Jones said. “It’s definitely
frustrating.”
’ Particularly frustrating when
you consider the golden
opportunity thatJones has missed
out on. After completing his first
year as a Panther, in which he
appeared in 31 games, Jones was
slated to begin the 1991—’92
campaign as Pitt’s starting small
forward. Then he broke his toe.
In his absence, the small
forward position is being
occupied by sophomore Gandhi
Jordan and first-year player
Orlando Antigua. Jordan started
in Pitt’s win over the Canadian
National Team.
Jones finished last season on a

‘ high note, starting in seven of

Pitt’s ﬁnal eight games lastseason,
and spent the summer improving
his offensive game. “I stayed here
all summer and had a pretty good
summer,” Jones said. Jones
worked out with teammates Sean
Miller, Gandhi Jordan and Chris
McNeal.

In addition to missing on-court
conditioning, Jones’ injury has
also caused him to miss most of
the team’s off-court instruction.‘
This involves reviewing offensive
plays and various defensive
presses. About possibly falling
behind, Jones showed no
concerns. “I’m not worried about
it,” Jones said.

Another subject thatJones said
he doesn’t lose sleep over is
preseason ranking. College-
basketball pundits have projected

the Panthers to finish anywhere
from fifth to seventh in the Big
East. Jones said he pays little
attention to such polls. “Really,
that doesn’t count,” Jones said.
“Last year they picked us to win
it. Did we win it? No, we didn’t.”

Jones added that the so-called
“experts” aren’t rating the
Panthers on who returns.,“They
rate us on who we lost ltoI,”
Jones said. “We can’t worry about
what they write. We just have
show them that we belong.”

When asked to assess the ’91-
’92 Panthers-, Jones expressed
confidence in the team’s ability.
“I think we have a ton of talent,”
said Jones, who liked what he
saw in the exhibition game.
“Everyone played unselfish. If
we work real hard, we can be a
really good team.”

One of Pitt’s key additions this
season is of added importance to
Jones: 6-11 center Eric Mobley,"
Jones and Mobley were
teammates at Allegheny
Community Collegein Maryland,
where the tandem led the team
to a 30-6 record and a No. 15
national ranking. Jones said he
thinks that once Mobley gets
acquainted with Big East
basketball, he’ll be a terrific

‘player. “He hasn’t played in a

year and a half now. It’s gonna
take him a- while, especially in

conference play,” Jones said. “By -
_ the time he. leaves here, I think

he’ll be ready to play at the next
level [NBA].’’ ’

boards in Pitt’s season-opening
win over Northwest Missouri
State, added eight points against
Cornell and five versus Robert
Morris. But with the coming of
the conference schedule, Jordan's
minutes diminished.

Still, he was able to make his
presence known.

AgainstGeorgetown atthe Civic
Arena, Jordan picked up five
points in just two minutes,
including a big, four-point play
which kept Pitt close. Butjordan
only played in five of Pitt’s last 13
games.

This yearjordan is an important
part of the team because of the
lack of proven scorers. Even

though the Panthers don’t have a

powerful one-two punch like
Jason Matthews and Brian Shorter
around, the points will still come.
“We have guys who can put the
ball in the hole,” Jordan said.
“Sean [Miller] is going to pick it
up some. Ahmad lShareefl

showed that he can score. Chris
and I are also going to pick up the
slack. I think it’s going to have to
be a whole team effort. We don’t
have two players who are going
to explode, but everybody is
going to do their part.”

Jordan has been doing his part
in the exhibition season. In the
two preseason gamesjordan was
the Panthers’ most effective three-
point shooter, hitting four of seven
attempts. Jordan also has proven
to be a good defender, too. “I see
a lot of confidence in Gandhi
now,” McNeal said. “He’s come a
long way defensively. Last
summer he worked on his foot
work and got in shape. All of that
helps him.”

If Jordan is in the frontcourt to
start the year, a familiar face will
likely be beside him —— McNeal’s.
The 6-8 junior was a top reserve
last year, when he showed a
willingness to bang as well as a
nice medium-range jumper. He

Tonight’s ‘season5'o'p‘e‘ni’ng '

game could be called uncharted
waters for the Pitt team.

This game marks the Panthers’

game is similar to Pitt’s; they play
mostly man-to-man on defense
and look for the fastbreak

8 whenever the opportunity arises.

One good part of the NIT is that
all of the games prior to the
semifinals are played on the

  

 

higher seed’s home court. That’s
good because Pitt will open at
home, but if the Panthers win,
they will go on the road Friday
night to face the winner of the
Kentucky-West Virginia game.

Pitt forward Brian Brush, who

‘started both exhibition games,

could earn a place in the starting
lineup tonight, also. Head coach
Paul Evans said he was not sure
of the starting five, which was
tentatively listed as Chris McNeal
and Brush at the forward spots,
Sean Miller and Ahmad Shareef
playing guard and Darren
Morningstar at center.

Mobley

Continued from page H-5
that we waited to put him in
instead of throwing him right to
the wolves. He came in and
responded. He was more relaxed
than he’s been in the previous
practices, I would say.”

In the second exhibition
Mobley was less impressive,
scoring eight points and getting
no rebounds in 11 minutes.

“I would say right now he
won’t start because Darren’s
playing so well,” Coleman said.
“I think we can play him and
Darren together at times, but
that’s probably a little bit down
the ro_ad. He’s going to play, but
how many minutes I really can’t
say.”

Mobley is working hard to‘

shake off the two-year rust for his
first Big East game, especially on
offense.On days when the

A Panthers don’t practice, Mobley

goes up to the Fitzgerald Field
House and practices jump hooks
for a half an hour.

“The moves are coming,”
Coleman said, “but he’s just not
finishing the plays right now. He
has to work on his stamina so that
he can play a longer period of
time. He has to work on his post
defense a little bit too.”

Mobley’s biggest contribution

to this year’s team should be on.

the defensive end of the court.
His height and long arms should
make him a dangerous shot‘
blocker, although he had no
official blocks in either exhibition.

“He’s got the ability to play
ldefensel,” Evans said. “He’s just
out of position sometimes. But
when he’s where he’s supposed
to be, he’s tough to shoot over,
and he can block some shots.
That’s where we think he’s going
to be strong this year. He’s just
got to get used to a team defensive
concept.”

“No one blocks 12-15 shots a
game on a regular basis,”
Sarandrea said. “They come when
they come. T here’ll be games
where he gets five or six; there’ll
be games when he won’t get any
and there’ll be games maybe he’ll
get 11.” -

Mobley’s goals are modest this
year. “I just want to have a solid

season, it appears that Mobley
has already given reason for Pitt
fans to be optimistic for the future.

“It’s nice that we have a
‘franchise’ player of the future
who’s 6-11, and we can start to
build around him,” Sarandrea

said. “WithJerry McCullough and
Orlando Antigua and Ahmad
[Shareef] and what we have
coming in this year, we have the
makings of a pretty good
basketball team all built around
Eric.

“I think the best basketball for
Eric Mobley is ahead of him,”
Sarandrea said.

major impact with Pitt utilizing
the press more often this season,
and his stamina should be a big
factor

“He ’s got a tremendous amount
of stamina. He can run all day
and all night long,” Sarandrea
said. “So he’s gonna be beating
whoever is covering him up the
floor on numerous occasions.”

“We don’t have as many big
players and strong players as
they did last year. What we do
have is a lot of athletes and faster
players who like to get up and
down the court,” Antigua said.

' His presence will help to fill
the void left by the foot injury to
senior Antoine Jones.

Jones should return by late
December in time for the Big East
wars that await a very young
team.

He has worked in the weight
room for added muscle, which
will help him fight through picks
in the paint.

“They’re stressing a lot of
defense,” Antigua said. “They
want us to come out there and be
in everybody’s face and not let
them get away’ any free, easy
shots.”

Despite the fact that Antigua is
a new face to Pitt basketball, he
has already established himself
as a leader on this team. This
should come as no surprise since
Antigua captained his team at St.
Raymond's for two seasons and
served as the student body
president his senior year.

“I would say he has
demonstrated some excellent
leadership not only in high school,
but he’s starting to do it here,”
Sarandrea said. “Even though

PIT!‘ HOOPS, THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, November 20, 1991

practice is only a few weeks old
now, I already think he’s got the
respect of most of the guys on the
team.”

“The things he can’t do, he’s
smart enough to realize, so he
doesn't usually try to do these
things and get himself in trouble,”
Evans said. “We recruited him as
much for his attitude as his playing
ability. His attitude compensates

'for a lot, and he runs the floor as

well as anybody we’ve got.”
Some of Antigua’s strongest
assets are the communication and
toughness he brings on the floor.
“That’s probably one of my
strongest points,” he said. ‘‘I like
to get out there and talk ‘cause it
gets me hyped‘ up and I guess it
gets the other guys pumped up.
We try to stress talking and

communicating; that’s part of .

defense.”

“When he crosses that line to
go on the floor, he turns from Mr.
Nice Guy to Mr. Hard Nose,”
Evans said.

Antigua is looking forward to
playing in the rugged Big East
conference againstAll—Americans
like Malik Sealy of St. John’s and
David Johnson of Syracuse.

“I’m looking forward to playing
against Malik ‘cause I’m sure he’s
gonna teach me a lot,” Antigua
said. “That’s what I need right
now. I’m looking at this year as a
learning experience, to see the
things-that I can do and see what
I can learn from other players,
playing in practices and playing
against other teams.”

The Big East coaches selected
Antigua to the second team of
their preseason All-Rookie squad
and rate Pitt as the No. 8 club
entering the campaign, but

Miller

 

Antigua isn’t concerned with this.
His focus for this season is to
play as consistently as possible
and especially to play tough
defense.

“I’m glad they consider me
that, but I’m not really trying to
concentrate too much on that,”
he said. “I just want to try to help
the team out to win as many
games as we can.- I’m glad that
they have us eighth because we’re
gonna surprise a lot of people
just for the simple fact that the
guys on the team really want to
play, and we’re gonna play
together.”

“We want to come out and
prove people wrong. We think
we’re a whole lot better than
that, but they don’t. So what we
gotta do is come out and prove
it to them. That’s what we’re
gonna do.”

Continued from page H-2

Before last season began, there
were high expectations for these
Panthers, who were returning ﬁve
experienced players, including
Miller. -

Even though that team had a
tremendous amount of success,
it still managed to lose some very
close games that it was capable
of winning.

Said Miller: “I think offensively
we might not be quite as good,
especially in the ha1f—court [game],
as we were last year. But on
defense, that’s something you can
control for most of the game, and
last year we could have been

better at it.” _

A season ago the Panthers
scored an average of 83.6 points
a’ game while holding their
opponents to an average of nearly
80 points an outing, but this Pitt
team is looking to show some
people that it is just as good as
last year’s team.

“I think this year we have to be
better on defense,” Miller said,
“and [for] 40 minutes, we gotta
try to hold people. And I think
we just have to keep our heads,
and no matter what happens
early on, I think our whole key is
to get better and make a run at it

, at the end.” A ‘

PI'I'I‘ HOOPS, THE PI'IT NEWS, Wednesday, November 20, 1991

A Sop/90m0reHuemrz'c/9 steps to tbefm

By Ryan Buncher
Sta_[fW'r1'ter

Jonna Huemrich glares over at
Coach Kirk Bruce as she walks
over to the Pitt bench. She seems
frustrated with the way the game
is going, even though Pitt is
winning.

“What do you want from me?”

. she asks.

Outbursts like that one at one
of the women’s basketball games
last season are part of what both
Bruce and Huemrich hope to
avoid this season. Part of the
frustration the 6-foot center had
after every mistake interfered

_ with what was an outstanding,

first season.

“I get frustrated easy,”

scored in double figures six times
and had 17 points and six
rebounds against Villanova in
his first Big East game.

“Chris took a while to adjust
after sitting out a season,” said
head coach Paul Evans. “He was
a little inconsistent, but he
provided us with some good
minutes off the bench.”

For the season, McNeal
averaged 6.2 points and 4.5
boards a game while playing
around 18 minutes a contest.
This year McNeal will be one of
the leaders of the team on the
court because of his versatility.
In the two exhibition games
McNeal has displayed a soft

Huemrich said. “I want to
overcome that. I definitely want
to play better than last year. I
played all right, but sometimes I
got frustrated. When I do
something bad, I just have to take
it in stride.”

Coach Bruce has made a point
about Huemrich staying under
control. Bruce said in the past,
Huemrich has sometimes been
her own worst enemy, wanting
to do everything perfectly and
getting upset when she didn’t.

“I don’t expect any more from
her than she can do, and she can
do a lot for us, but she doesn’t
have to do extra,” Bruce said.

One thing that seems to need
some work is physical play on
the inside.

“Rebounding, positioning,
never box anybody out,”
Huemrich said about weaknesses
in her game. “Looking to shoot
more than I have.”

Playing within herself may be
tougher with the loss of two
major parts of the team’s inside
game, forward Lorri Johnson and
center Connie Hurt.

“Last year [Hurt and Johnson]
were a big chunk of our offense,”
Huemrich said. “Lorri was good
for almost 30 points a game. I’ll
have to pick up some of the
points, and Turia [Ransom] will
have to pick up some. I’ll have to
rebound more.”

Actually, Johnson averaged 23
points and 9.1 rebounds per game
overall, 21.9 and 9.7 in Big East

play. Hurt averaged 11.2 points
and 5.1 rebounds overall, 10.2
and 4.4 against the Big East.

“There will be some pressure
on her to do more,” Bruce said.
“There will be more expected of
her, but I expected her to hold up
her end last year, and she did
that. And that was with [Johnson]
here.”'

Huemrich was the only player
on the team to start in all 29
games last season (21 at center
and eight at power forward). She
averaged 10 points and 6.7
rebounds per game overall, 11
points and 7.6 boards against Big
East competition. Coach Bruce
rated her the best first-year player
in the league during the season.
That was backed up by her being

In-15

named Big East Freshman of the
Year. Now she must follow up on
her performance as a rookie. She
got some national recognition
lately, being included on USA
Todays list of players to watch in
the Big East.

“The sophomore year is a
critical year in the development
of a player,” Bruce said. “Now
she knows what to expect of
herself, her teammates and the
competition.”

Huemrich agreed on the
importance of that year of
experience.

Huemrich said, “Last year I was
scared. I played scared a lot
because I didn’t know what to
expect. Now I know what to
expect.”

perimeter touch as well as a power
game inside. “How Chris scores
is going to depend on who we
play," Jordan said. “If we’re
playing a team with a big man
who’s not going to check him at
17 feet, obviously he’s going to
shoot jump shots all day. But if
they have somebody 6-5 guarding
Chris, he’s going to score on the
blocks.’’

McNeal is one of theuveterans,
and he plays that role well.

He seems to direct traffic out
on the court, constantly urging
his teammates on. “Chris has
always been a leader type,” Jordan
said. “He lets his emotions go on
the court. He was always like
that, even when we were

 

roommates at Oak Hill. He wants
to win, so when we’re out there
on the court, he’ll pick us up.”

“I try to get people in the right
positions, help some of the
younger guys out,” McNeal said.
“Things like that really help them
out because in two more years
they’re going to be out there
instead of me.”

Both players like what they see
from this young squad so far.
“T here’s a lot of unselfishness on
this team, ” McNeal said. “We have
a lot of athletes out there, and
even though we don’t get a lot of
points in the half—court offense,
we’ll get a lot of points on the
break this year.”

“By playing good half—court
defense and if we can get some
points off the turnovers and the

press, it’s all going to help us pick
up for the scoring that we lost.
We have to be a better defensive
team than last year.”
