With the Semester at Sea ship
departing this Sunday for the spring
term, student safety has become priori-
ty for those in charge of the itinerary.

Last November, two Semester at

terrorist attack in Luxor, Egypt. They
weren't harmed, but this spring, SAS
students will not visit Egypt. That coun-
try was taken off the itinerary for the
fall semester voyage as well. Before
that, administrators removed Israel due
to the suicide bombings taking place
there. ,

SAS ofﬁcial Paul Watson said the
program is constantly taking precau-
tions both before and during a voyage
to ensure that the students’ trip ﬁnishes
without a crisis.

Recent events in Kenya have raised

In the third overtime of Pitt's ﬁnal
regular season football game — a bout at
West Virginia to determine if Pitt could
earn a trip to the Liberty Bowl — the
crowd of Pitt fans who traveled to the
game screamed and hollered, many of
them wearing the school's new logo on
their sweatshirts. .

Two years ago, this scene was incon-
ceivable. “Fair-weather” fans refused to
be supportive of a losing team. Many
attribute the sudden change in school
spirit to Athletics Director Steve
Pederson, a
man who sat in

major changes have taken place so great
that he is known to countless fans and
alumni as the athletic director "who
turned Pitt athletics around."

His ﬁrst improvement to the depart-
ment involved overseeing major recon-
struction of athletic facilities. Pederson
was also concerned with the non—athletic
perspective on sports.

"[Steve] is very concerned about stu-
dents havinga good time," said Joseph
Cavalla,_ director of student activities.

In his quest for a more "fan-friendly"
athletic department, Pederson made

on the fans, and is convinced that they are
as important to the teams’ success as the
players themselves.

"Students are the reason we're here,"
said Pederson. "I want to make things
better for our student athletes and our
fans."

With a football team on the fall for
almost a decade, Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg felt the future of Pitt depend-
ed on the immediate strengthening of the
athletic department. More than 90 people
applied for the position, and after a tense

‘ selection process, Steve Pederson pre-

pared his family for the move from
Nebraska to Pittsburgh and was officially
named athletics director on October 28,
1996.

"Those who knew him labeled Steve
a ‘can't miss candidate,"' said Nordenberg.
"After spending several hours with him, I
came to the same conclusion.''

JASON GALLINGER Fo1gATi1_E_P

A Student Mail Services employee sorts mail at the Melwood Avenue facility.

Mail Services says it does all it

can to keep students happy .

Jason Gallinger

For The Pitt News

From junk mail to letters from
mom and dad, if you live on campus,
your mail is handled by Pitt's Mail
Services.

It is a complex process occurring
almost entirely behind the scenes of
everyday life at Pitt. Nonetheless, not
everybody is satisfied with the service.

"I think it's way too slow,'' fresh-
man Tonya Holbrook said.
"Sometimes you're waiting for impor-
tant stuff, like money from home or a
letter you can't wait to get."

But Gus Tytke, the head of Mail
Services, said he wasn't aware of any
problems. -

"I was under the impression that
the mail service was perceived as a
fairly good service," Tytke said. He

‘added that his office has received few

complaints about the speed of deliv-
ery. Tytke said that if he receives little
negative feedback, he assumes there is
no problem with the service.
According to Tytke, the post office
sorts incoming student mail by the
special four-digit zip codes assigned to
the residence halls. Mail is then deliv-
ered directly to the dorms, where an
effort is made to have it in students’
mailboxes by noon of the day that the
building's mail room receives it.
Joyce McGlothlin, head of Student
Mail Services, which serves students
living on campus, said that if there is a
problem with mail being delivered
quickly, this occurs either because it's

incorrectly addressed or because of
students changing rooms.

"Mail gets delivered right away if
it has the correct address on it,"
McGlothlin said.

She also said that Student Mail
Services receives around 1,000 incor-
rectly-addressed letters each day. The
Student Mail Services staff must then
try to track down eachlstudent to find
out what his or her address is. That
isn't always an easy task. For instance,
McGlothlin pointed out that there are
20 people named Jason in Tower B
alone.

Student room changes cause
greater problems, McGlothlin said. Of
the 3,000 students the Towers mail
room serves, McGlothlin said 2,000 of
them might change their rooms, and
that these students never tell Mail
Services their new room numbers, she
said. That can result in another day or
two being added to delivery times,
McGlothlin said.

Both Tytke and McGlothlin
acknowledged that packages take
longer to deliver. This is because each
package that won't fit in a mailbox
must be individually indexed and
labeled. Students then receive a ‘slip of
paper in their mailbox notifying them

, of the package.

Each year, Mail Services handles
5 million pieces of campus mail, 7
million pieces of incoming U.S. mail
for faculty and staff, and 3 million
pieces of incoming student mail,
according to Tytke. In addition to this

Mail, page 6

CORRECTION: In Monday's issue, Pitt spokesman Ken Service was incorrect-

buildings for Pitt. "

putting three people in one room.

"Part of what we experienced last year
will be resolved by cooperation of the
Greek system," he said, explaining that
fraternities and sororities will encourage
more members to live in Greek units, thus
potentially increasing bed availability on
campus.

Despite the current on—campus over-
crowding and student dissatisfaction, Pitt
has extended a guarantee for on—campus
rooms to all sophomores who ﬁle their
housing contracts on time during both
their first and second.year at school.

But Admissions and Financial Aid
raised its admission standards this year
and expects to enroll at least 200 fewer
new students than last year's 3,157.

Currently, 12 percent more students
than last year have applied to attend Pitt.
To counteract this increase and to offset
last year's larger enrollment, Admissions
and Financial Aid is currently offering 12
percent fewer acceptances than at this time
last year.

An increase in freshmen this year
caused the housing shortage that forced
832 students to cram into Sutherland Hall,
which was built to house only 624 people.

Betsy Porter, director of admissions
and financial aid, said "We really did
stretch our resources over capacity, and we
didn't meet the need of undergraduates.
We need to do a better job of projecting
freshman enrollments."

and heeds its advice when it comes to
shaky situations in or near countries
on the itinerary.

"We are constantly monitoring the
political situation in any of the coun-
tries we visit," stated Watson. He said
that all ports and student-safety issues
are under continuous review.

The current problems in Iraq

A would probably be enough to divert

the SS Universe Explorer from the
Suez Canal if the ship were using it,
but usually the canal is only used
when the vessel travels between India
and Mediterranean countries during
the fall semester's voyage. _
In 1990, SAS trip took a detour
from the Mediterranean because of the
situation in the Middle East preceding
operation Desert Storm, said Wright.

The ship headed down the east coast

of Africa instead.

Wright explained that SAS also
takes into consideration the advisories
issued by the Pinkerton Company,
which publishes its "Risk Assessment"
reports about foreign countries.

Also, SAS presents a program on
board the SS Universe Explorer called
"cultural pre-port" for two nights
before any given port of call. It is "an
ongoing effort to help educate stu-
dents on how to travel intelligently
and safely," says Watson. For each
port, students are given information

mom PAGE 1

on local customs, health hazards and
areas to avoid, along with cultural and
historical information. They are also
given the name and address of the ship
in that country's native language.‘

The purpose of cultural pre-port is
to educate passengers about every-
thing necessary for them to have the
best experience in that country, with
safety being a big part of this,
explained Watson. He said it's impor-
tant to stay well-informed during trav-
el for both SAS students and other
tourists.

"Even if you were traveling to
New York City," he said, "there would
be things that you would have to
know."

Pitt senior Charles Duncan said he
has absolutely no fears about his
upcoming SAS voyage. '

"From all accounts I've heard, I
tend to think that America is more
dangerous than all the foreign coun-
tries," he said."'If you heard two guys

were shot in New York, would that '

keep you from going?"

Dave Rosengrant, a Pitt student,
went on Semester -at Sea in fall 1995
and said his trip was without incident.
He said he felt the trip was absolutely
safe because the ship is rerouted when
future destinations look dangerous.

"I loved it," said Rosengrant, "I'd
go again in a heartbeat."

ic department normally complement
each other," said Pederson.

Pederson had previously been the
center of major athletic improvements.
He was responsible for many improve-
ments in the University of Nebraska's
facilities and fundraising —- he was
instrumental in raising $20 million to

‘ build a sky box and press box in

Nebraska's football stadium.

In the future, Pitt can expect more
changes coming from the athletic
department. The major project right
now is planning the Convocation
Center. The athletic department will be
busy in the next few months gathering
money for additional changes not cov-
ered in the $38 million grant from the
state.

"We haven't been out as aggressive-
ly as I would want asking for money,"
said Pederson.

Improvements will also be made to
Trees Hall, including the addition of a
full—sized indoor running track.

Pederson said he will continue, in
all improvements, to not only think
about what is best for the athletes, but
also what will beneﬁt the students and
make athletics at Pitt more personal.

"A personal touch rings out
throughout him and his whole staff,"
said Cavalla. ‘

students and faculty to proﬁle. If you

Banning books bad

The NAACP wants to‘ ban Mark Twain’s adven-
ture novel “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn”
from high school classrooms, claiming that the lan-
guage used by characters in the story — such as the
word “nigger” — is offensive and degrading to‘ all
African Americans.

Banning this book would be a big mistake.

Twain’s classic, written in 1885, tells a story of
slave life in 1840. Often considered a satirical master-
piece, the book, written in postslavery times, is con-
sidered to be a sociopolitical commentary on a culture
still adapting to the Emancipation Proclamation.
Proponents of teaching the novel argue that characters
who use such derogatory language are portrayed by
Twain so they look as stupid as possible.

Hardly anybody argues that “Huckleberry Finn” is
an antislavery novel or that mature readers should be
able to understand this.

The argument arrives with the questions of
whether high school students can understand the novel
as it was meant to be and whether it is possible. for
teachers to guide students to the correct interpretation
of the story.

NAACP members argue “no” to both questions. “I
don’t think there’s anyway you can teach it,” said
NAACP official Richard P. Burton Sr. “I don’t think
our teachers are equipped for it.”

Every book has to be put into perspective some-
how. If a reader doesn’t understand the history of a
story, where and when it was written, he may not be
able to understand the author’s meaning. But with that
information and with the appropriate guidance for
analyzing the literature, stories like Tvvain’.s can be
enlightening. .

For example, as Pitt English Professor Jonathan
Arac said in yesterday’s Pittsburgh Post—Gazette, read-
ers need to realize that “nigger” was a derogatory term
even in the 1840s and that people who use it in
Twain’s novel are, in fact, being vulgar.

That NAACP ofﬁcial’s comment is obviously
incorrect, as many students, including several on this
newspaper’s editorial board, have read the novel in
high school and understood it correctly.

There are much more difﬁcult texts to teach in
schools, like Homer’s “The Odyssey,” which is some-
times given to students as early as the ninth grade,
though few at that level have developed the reading
ability or historical knowledge to take anything away
from its content. But nobody is trying to ban that book
because nobody takes anything in it personally.

Perhaps anybody who takes the language in
“Huckleberry Finn” personally should ﬁnd a good
high school teacher to explain it to him.

Science ﬁction has a way of

coming true. It once seemed fan— (,

tastic to imagine an undersea ship
like Jules Verne described in
“20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.”
It‘ was once thought that the-
sound barrier stood in the sky

like a brick wall, ready to smash ‘

any pilot brash enough to chal-
lenge its immutability. And it
once seemed to be a horriﬁc ——
but reassuringly farfetched —
idea to make babies to order as in
Aldous Huxley’s “Brave New
World.”

Well, chalk one up for
human arrogance.

When Dr. Richard Seed

armounced last month that he

intended to start a clinic to clone '

human beings, it very quickly
became obvious that he was a
raving loon. Asked about the
moral ramiﬁcations of his inten-
tions, Seed defended cloning as
not only ' compatible with his
interpretation of his Methodist
faith, but indeed a fulfillment
thereof. In the words of the good
doctor: “God made man in his
own image. Therefore, He

' intended that manshould become

one with God. Man should have
an indeﬁnite life» and indeﬁnite
knowledge. And we’re going to
do it, and this is one step.’—’
(Apparently, young Richard
missed the Sunday school ses-
sion in which they covered the
First Commandment.)

The happy side effect of this

is that adherents of all the faiths
of the world can gather around as

The Pitt News

brothers and sisters to agree that
this ' guy is looney tunes. You
don’t even have to believe in God
— just in the concept of the logi-
cal syllogism — to see the holes
in this argument.

That a man who actually
wants to clone humans would be
off his nut is probably not sur-
prising. That he claims to have
four couples ready to participate
in this venture is sickening.
Nobody knows if human beings
can be successfully cloned. The
infamous Scottish sheep-cloning
experiment produced many
ﬂawed fetuses before Dolly was
born. Odds are against the ﬁrst
attempt at ‘human cloning —
heck, the first few hundred
attempts — producing healthy
children.

You have to ask yourself:
Who could be so incredibly self-
ish as to want offspring enough to
risk said child’s health?

Of course, we already know
the answer. Thousands of couples
use fertility treatments every
year, despite the danger of the
resulting children being adverse-
ly affected. '

Fertility drugs, like Pergonal
and Clomid, increase the inci-
dence of multiple births, even
when used absolutely correctly.

pWhile a pile of newborns makes

a great television event, it’s a far
from ideal situation for the kids.
If they survive to be born, they-
will quite possibly enter the
world prematurely and under-
weight. If they make it through
the first few months, they are
more likely to be mentally chal-
lenged than their peers who were

born one at a time.

-Parents want status symbol, not children 

Not , depressing enough? 
Then consider that fertility drugs {
are believed to triple the risk of 

ovarian cancer in the mother.

In-vitro fertilization also 

increases the risk of multiple
births. The procedure involves

the implantation -of multiple 
embryos in the uterus. In a _.:

(thankfully rare) complication,
sometimes two embryos fuse in
what is called a chimeric preg-
nancy. This is less visually star-
tling than, say, Siamese twins,
but pity the poor doctor who has
to announce to.the proud parents,
“It’s a hermaphrodite!”

It seems to me that newborns
are becoming "just another status

symbol, like the house in the sub— ‘
urbs and the urban assault vehi- .;

In this world where so many

unwanted children are born, cer- j

Columnist

For the last several months, an uneasy
situation has been brewing in Iraq. U.N.
groups monitoring Iraqi attempts to build
weapons of mass destruction have been
barred access to the sites they were monitor-
ing. Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein continues
to act deﬁantly toward the United States and
has even ordered his people to act as human
shields at these sites should we attempt to
bomb them.

The question is what the United States
should do next. Should we, as some
observers argue, move against Iraq only as
part of a multinational coalition, a true unit-
ed ﬁont? Or should we strike now, even if it
means acting alone, to ensure the safety and
security of the United States?

I believe that the United States ought to
strike now, without hesitation, to destroy
Saddam Hussein’s weapons program

In 1990 the United States was carefulto
act under the aegis of the United Nations in
our movement to expel Saddam from
Kuwait, but the times have changed. The
United States is no longer seen in countries
like Saudi Arabia as a brave protector, but
rather as an inconvenient nuisance. They
want our protection but are unwilling to sup-
port us when we act in matters that concern
our security.

To wait for our allies to join us is fool-

crclclcrm Hussein: Jus

 

ish. We would be ceding far too much con-
trol over matters concerning the security of
the United States to our allies, who have
proven themselves to be our ﬁiends only
when they are directly threatened

The wars of the future will not be fought
in the sands of the Middle East between
massive formations of armored vehicles and
sophisticated jet aircraft. The wars of the
future will not be fought by aircraft dropping
laser—guided bombs through elevator shafts.
The wars of the future will not be fought by
conventional means at all. The wars of the
future will be fought by small and deter-
mined states using weapons of mass destruc-
tion to inﬂict thousands upon thousands of
casualties on opponents they would have lit-
tle chance of defeating in the ﬁeld of battle.

Unless we do something, Iraq will
almost certainly become the ﬁrst tenorist
state to employ nuclear, chemical or biolog-
ical weapons in a large-scale terrorist cam-
paign. Saddam has shown himself to be a
man with a complete and reckless disregard
for the value of human life. During the Iran-
Iraq war, his soldiers employed chemical
weapons repeatedly to offset the manpower

advantage Iran had over his army. During the '

Persian Gulf War, he ﬁred Scud missiles at
noncombatant Israel in an effort to fracture
the UN. coalition. He has made war on his
own people, using chemical weapons
against even women and children in an effort
to massacre the Kurdish minority in northern

The United" States is a nation remark-

rity procedures are woeful-
ly inadequate to combat
this threat and that it may
only be a matter of time
before we witness an act of
tenorism carried out here
by a hostile nation.

Col. e David H. 
Hackworth, a retired U.S. Army oﬂicer, has
complained: “Each time [Saddam] pulls our
chain, we respond with half measures: sanc-
tions, cruise missiles, no-ﬂy zones.  We
have to stop treating him like a juvenile

delinquent when it’s clear that he is really a‘

The United  should act immedi-
ately, by. whatever means necessary, to
ensure that Saddam’s program for weapons

obliterated. ’

Rape articles
insulted victims

On Tuesday, The Pitt News pub-
lished two articles about the recent
rapes that occurred in Lothrop Hall.
These two articles made me feel like
I’m attending a university stuck in the
Middle Ages.

In the front page article, Pitt

Police Deputy Chief Gary Moses was
quoted as saying that one of the
alleged rapists “isn’t ‘the type’ to
sneak into a dorm and rape again.”
I’m wondering if a person has to rape
twice, or three to ﬁve times before
being considered “the type.” Once is
actually a crime, therefore making the
rapist “the type”.

Both of the rapes were acquain-
tance rape, a category to distinguish
from stranger rape. In this country,
most women who are sexually
assaulted know their attackers,
whether they are neighbors, friends,
friends of friends, relatives,
boyfriends, etc.

The editorial following this front
page story opens with this sentence:
“Two students were raped last week-
end, and both incidents could have
been avoided if the victims had not
invited their attackers into their
homes.” The rest of the article claims

not to be blarrring the victim, but this
first sentence is, in fact, blaming the
victim.

A “woman is never, ever inviting
rape if she allows a man into her
home. Ever. If we did live by this
code, then how many friendships
would be lost? “I’m sorry, you can’t
come in because you might rape me.
Goodnight.” Women have the right to
go and do whatever they wish, just as
men do. People do not have the right
to be invited in and then rape another
person. That’s why it is a criminal act.

The two men involved are the sole
reasons for the assaults, NOT the two
women who were raped. I also won-
der if the authors ever once stopped to
consider how these medieval opinions
might feel to these two students, who
no doubt feel responsible enough
already without their student peers
slamming their actions as partially
responsible for these sexual assaults.

I know. I’ve been there.

Nowhere to study
when needed

’ In his “Campus Update” for Oct. 29,
1997, Chancellor Nordenberg stated: ‘This
University’s most basic responsibilities are

dents...bydoingallwecantocreatean

overall learning environment.” ’ --

While this university does provide us
with many fantastic learning enviromnents,
such as the 24-hour availability of both the
Benedurn computer labs and the Cathedral
Commons, there is much room for improve-
ment that simply requires better rnanage-
ment.

For example, on the weekends preceed-
ing ﬁrial exarrrs for the past two semesters
(Spring 97-2 and Fall 98-1), I was shocked
and extremely enraged when I arrived at the
Cathedral to stake out my usual table only to
ﬁnd the Commons closed. The spring event
included activities for the Ronald McDonald

House, and the fall activity was a dinner for .

the chancellor and the Heinz Chapel Choir.

While I do believe that it is to our bene-
ﬁt to rent out this beautiful facility, the chan-
cellor himself has said that the University
has a responsibility ﬁrst to its students. Of
course, Hillman was open 24 hours —

The University of Pittsburgh has
its share of rivalries. A

First and foremost is the ﬁght for
Pennsy1vania’s bragging rights
between Pitt and the hated Penn State

Nittany Lions.
Pitt also has the “Backyard
Brawl” with West Virginia — a

matchup that features two Division-I

schools separated only by .90 miles of ,

pavement. ‘ .

Then, last but not least, there’s the
battle with cross-town rival Duquesne.

Huh? '

Yes, that’s right, Duquesne. ,

In recent years, the Dukes have
become a formidable opponent for the
Pitt men’s basketball team. Last sea-
son, the Dukes and Panthers played in
one of the most exciting games in
recent series history, with Pitt winning
in the ﬁnal seconds.

Duquesne will get a chance to
avenge last season’s loss to the
Panthers on Thursday night when the
two teams battle in the third armual
“City. Game” at the Civic Arena at

Last year’s victory may have
turned the Panthers’ 1996-97" season
around, vaulting them to an 18-15
record and‘ an invitation to the
National Invitational Tournament.

The reeling Panthers, who are
licking their wounds after being
defeated by West Virginia on Tuesday
night, have dropped their last ﬁve
games and are hoping the “City
Game” will have the same positive
results this year. ‘

However, the Dukes, who hold a
9-12 overall record, are coming off a
big win" against La Salle and will put
up a ﬁght to be the best hoops team in
Pittsburgh.

“They are a very deep team and
they like to press and get after you,”
Pitt Head Coach Ralph Willard ‘said.
“Scott Edgar has that team playing
well right now. They also have one of
the best guards in the Atlantic 10 in
Mike James.”

Despite their subpar record, the
Dukes are a very talented and experi-
enced squad. Duquesne is anchored by
senior guard Mike James, who ‘leads
the Atlantic 10 Conference in scoring,
averaging 19.0 points per game.

James, he can look for help from his
frontcourt. Senior forwards‘ Nick
Bosnic, who averages 13.4 ppg, and
Kevin Price, who averages 12.1 ppg,
complement freshman forward Kevin
Shand, who leads the Dukes with 23
blocked shots.

It is still unknown whether sopho-
more guard Kellii Taylorwill play for
Pitt. Taylor, who has been hampered
by a sore arch, sat out Tuesday’s game
at West Virginia.

The Panthers are also uncertain of
the status of freshman guard Ricardo
Greer, who left Tuesday’s West
Virginia game with a contusion on his
left leg. Also, Vonteego Cummings
received stitches above his eye after
colliding with freshman Stephen
Flores in a shoot—around prior to the
WVU game. Flores lost a tooth in the
collision, and while Cummings played

with his injury, he made just one shot»-

in 10 . -attempts versus the

Pitt women’s basketball senior
Latia Howard came into this sea-
son expecting great things.

But after an evening of pain
and fear, and after one complicat-
ed, life-saving medical procedure,
her season ended before it even
began.
Days after her team’s ﬁrst
exhibition game of the season, a
game in which she started,
Howard woke up in the middle of
the night suffering from shortness
of breath and a sharp pain in her
side.

Shortness of breath is nothing
new for the Pitt senior".
She had been diag-
nosed with anemia ear-
lier in her career,
according to Pitt trainer
Jennifer Beck

But the pain made
her decide that it might
be more serious than

just anemia She took
herself to the emer-
gency room, and the
doctors delivered the
bad news —— she had a '
bacterial infection on
her mitral valve, and
some of the bacteria
had leaked to her
spleen, causing the pain
in her side.

The doctors questioned why
Howard had not yet suﬂ°ered a
stroke or a heart attack while play-
ing basketball. The problem was
very serious, so the doctors sched-
uled open-heart surgery for this 21-
year-old basketball player just
three days after her examination.

The doctors discovered that
the infection started sometime in
rnid-August and had grown pro-
gressively worse since then.

“We didn’t know how to feel.
We were shocked and Confused,”
Head Coach Kirk Bruce said of his
team’s reaction to Howard’s situa-
tion.

On the morning of Nov. 22,
Howard went into the hospital to
have the bacterial infection
removed.

Before the surgery, Howard
said, “I prayed hard. If it meant not
playing basketball, I did not want
to go through surgery.”

Howard’s comments down-
played the seriousness of her con-
dition, according to some of the

Howard’ has been courtside at every ga

medical staff. r

‘This situation could have
been life or death had they not
caught it as early as they did,”
Beck said.

The doctors removed her
valve, cleaned the bacteria off it
and then reirnplanted it in her
instead of replacing it —— returning
Howard to a normal life with bas-
ketball, according to Dr. Freddie
Fu.

“It is a very unusual and rare
condition” for any person, espe-
cially a person so young, Fu said.

Her condition and the surgery
sidelined Howard for the whole of
her senior campaign. All of these
events occurred before the Lady

 

 
 
 
      

at

Panthers even began their regular
season.

Coach Bruce said the team has.

appealed to the NCAA for a ruling
on whether. Howard will receive a
medical redshirt. If the request is
granted, this means that she would
not lose her last year of eligibility
and could play again next year.

“She missed a lot of classes,
too,” Bruce said of Howard’s con-
dition. She could also use the extra
year to make up for time lost in the
classroom, according to the coach.

scorer, rebounder and shot-blocker
her sophomore and jrmior seasons.
The team has missed her this year,
going only 4-16.

On Feb. 1, 1997, Howard

Senior swimmer Dejo sets sigh s on Nationals

Kindra Wykoff
Staff Wrlter

, ‘ Vlfrth her hair still wet from practice
and her long blue swimmer’s coat draped
over her, Isabel Dejo emerges from the

locker room. , . ,
Because sprinting is her specialty,
and her coaches are using a new tapering

V (less yardage) regimen, she has ﬁnished _

before her teammates.
As the other women linger in the
water and continue to work on their

strokes, the only thing on Dejo’s mind is

the Big East championships. She’s more
than ready for the challenging four days
that await.
_ “I’ve already gone best times this
season, and it’s not even conference,”
Dejo.said.

Dejo, a 21-year-old senior from

I Burke, Va, has.been.swimming since age v.

mne. .

That could be one reason why she is
among the top three swimmers in the S0-
and 100—yard freestyle events in the Big
East Conference. ’ '

Dejo is no stranger to success.

In high school, her speed consistently
won her the 50-yard freestyle.

“In the 50 and 100, Iwas state runner-
up for Virginia,” said Dejo. ‘

This winning streak has followed her
to Pitt '

She came here because she liked the
coach and the program.

“I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do
academically,” said Dejo. “Swimming
was the mainthing.”

As a freshman, she won her ﬁrst race
in her ﬁrst meet for the Panthers, and her
success didn’t stop there.

“I ﬁnaled in everything in the Big

ﬁnished in the top six,” said Dejo.
She continues to impress her coaches
with hard work and a natural talent that

takes her a long way in her quest for _

excellence every season.

This year that same consistent hard
work maycatapult her from the Big East
Conference to the NCAA championships.

“[The] Big East is in twoweeks, and
I have a really good chance to make
NCAA this year,” Dejo said. -

Last year was the ﬁrst time the Big
East Conference meet was held outside of
Pittsburgh. But Dejo didn’t let the absence
of a hometown crowd atfect her one bit.‘
She still made two ﬁnals and swam a life-
time best.

“I went 23.9 ' [seconds] in the 50
[freestyle] and 52.1 in the 100 free. I

ﬁnaled in both’ and did my lifetime best in’

the 100‘ﬂy,” said Dejo. _

“John Turman is a big guy that.

we liked,” said Harris. “John will be
given a chance for the starting job in
the fall.”

The Panthers also signed two of
Western Pennsylvania’s highly tout-
ed prospects in Brandon Williams
and Amir Purifoy.

Both WPIAL players were first-
team all-state selections. Williams
was the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette’s
Player of the Year and ranked as one
of the top running backs in the
country.

“There is a wonderful opportu-
nity for a. mature individual here,”
said Harris. “Brandon will be in the
mix of things for the tailback posi-
tion.”

Harris" concentrated on recruit-
ing linemen —»one of the Panthers’
biggest weaknesses last season. For
Harris, linemen are as important as
quarterbacks on the field and are of

-the utmost value in practice.

“If you can’t practice, you can’t
get better. If you don’t have line-
men, you can’t practice,” said‘
Harris. “To me, linemen were a big
focus.”

He wasn’t joking when he said

“big focus.” Pitt signed six 300.-

pound linemen, which should bol-
ster both the offensive and defen-
sive fronts.

Harris also discussed playing
time for the incoming freshmen.
“We will play the freshmen if they
are ready, but we won’t waste them.
If we have to redshirt a guy to help
us down the line,» we will. We won’t
forsake the futurefor the present.”

The focus of yesterday’s press
conference was the future. “We are
in the process of turning the pro-
gram around. I believe these recruits
have helped us upgrade,” said
Harris.

‘The Panthers have given out
only 78 scholarships out of a possi-
ble 85. Harris said he encourages
walk-ons, and this might lead to a
few extra scholarships.

“We are trying to give our walk-
ons motivation. There are a few [to
whom] we are thinking about giving
scholarships,” said Harris. ,

Harris said Pitt is waiting to
hear from three more recruits whom
he couldn’t comment on because of
NCAA regulations.

_The speculation is that Ike
Williams and Jay Chapman are two
of these players. Williams is a’high-
ly touted junior-college wide
receiver, and Chapman is a highly
rated wide receiver from
Washington, D.C. Some recruiting
services list Chapman as the No. 2
receiver in the East.

DEJO

THE PITT NEWS

FROM PAGE 13

When asked what she thinks it will
take for a repeat performance this year,
Dejo simply answered, ”hard work.”

Coach Marian Cassidy-Keen and
Assistant Coach Jennifer Michaels make
sure that Dejo and the other swimmers
exercise their commitment to hard work
every day at practice.

‘They let us know that even if you’re
behind, but you’re trying your hardest and
putting your best effort in, it’s going to help
you no matter what,” Dejo said.

Michaels often videotapes the sprint-
ers from both above and below the water.
This technique helps them with every
aspect of their swimming.

“She’s always trying to help us with
our strokes,” Dejo said. “She is really sup-
portive of us.”

Dejo smiles when speaking about her
coaches and teammates. It’s obvious that
this group is a close one from the photo of
the team taken in Hawaii.

“It’s the hardest training trip,” Dejo
said. ‘Two and a half hours twice a day.
Every day, you train and you’re with
everyone. But everyone still had the most
positive attitudes and there was a lot of
support from everyone on the trip this
year.”

The training for the Big Eastﬁnals
continues to change as the ladies head
toward the end of the season.

VV1th more tapering being thrown in,
the women look to one another for the
extra little push that only a teammate can

give.
Dejo gets that push from fellow sprint-
er Melissa Bums. ‘

“Melissa is a sprinter that’s parallel to
me. We push each other a lot,” said Dejo.

Although she’s a little nervous about
the arrival of the biggest test of the season,
the Big East Championships, Dejo feels
the team is definitely ‘ready.

“I’m nervous but conﬁdent because
we’ve already had a really good season,”
Dejo said. “I’m ready to go fast.”

While Villanova and Miami are the
favorites, Dejo is conﬁdent about Pitt’s
chances.

“We came in fourth last year, but this
year places are really up in the air. We
have a really good chance,” Dejo said.

Although she is looking forward to the
Big East competition, she also seems ready
for the well-deserved rest she will receive
after the championships and school are
over.

After graduating with a degree in ele-
mentary education and a minor in chil-
dren’s literature, she plans to go back home
to Virginia.

Dejo doesn’t plan to take it , easy
though. In January 1999 she will begin
grad school at George Mason University.
She also expects to take a year off from
swimming. _

“I might try to compete after school is
done, but I’ll probably rest for awhile, take
a break. Maybe take up another sport,”

said Dejo, laughingly.

KATKOWSKI  

pavement: the often—punishing world of
beneath-the-basket play.

Often six inches shorter than oppos— ~

ing forwards, Katkowski relies on
quickness and tenacity to score as many
rebounds and make as many driving
layups as possible. Often, as was twice
the case in the Georgetown game, she
ends up on the ground with the ball.

Of course, she isn’t complaining. _

“I like it better,” she said. “It gives
me more of a chance to get the ball
inside.”

So when a player plays this hard -
when a 19-year-old undergoes major
surgery thanks to basketball wear and
tear — what does she do right after the
game? ‘

Challenge a teammate to a game of
one-on-one? Soak in the trainer’s
whirlpool for three hours?

Sleep? -

No. When Katkowski emerges from
the locker room, she heads right over to
her family — father Robert, mother
Susan and Grandmother Marian, who
gives the sophomore 10 50-cent pieces
after every game faster than you can say
“NCAA rules violation.”

Katkowski, who chose Pitt partly
because her parents could make the
short drive from Mt. Pleasant to watch

FROM PAGE 13

her play, said the half dollars have been
coming from grandma for as long as she
can remember.

“Always when I was little, [I got
them] here and there,” she said. “By
high school, it was $5 every game.”

Most of the money goes unused —
tens of silver pieces rest somewhere in
the sophomore’s dorm room. But ...

“When I’m really low on cash,” .

Katkowski admitted, “I’ll wrap them up;
Send them to the bank.”

Her next opportunity to earn the
coins comes tonight, when the Panthers
take on Duquesne at the Civic Arena.
Katkowski’s task for the evening: to
guard Lady Duke standout Korie Hlede.

Hlede is second in the nation in
scoring, averaging 27.4 points per game.
She is a finalist for the Dapper Dan
Sportsman of the.Year Award —— the
only college athlete on the list besides
Pitt quarterback Pete Gonzalez. Asked

‘ about Hlede after the Georgetown game,

Pitt Head Coach Kirk Bruce simply said,
“You can’t stop Korie.”

Katkowski, who scored ﬁve points
versus the Hoyas and averages just over
four a game, will try to do just that.

“I’m excited,” she said. “We’re real-
ly, looking forward to playing Duquesne
tomorrow.”

The Tar Heels and Blue Devils are
neck and neck in every single statistical
category kept by the Atlantic Coast
Conference —— all the way from
blocked shots to the infamous assist—to—
turnover ratio. _ .

Where Duke has depth, North
Carolina has dominance from the tip.

Jamison, who many think is the
nation’s best al1—around player, leads
the ACC in scoring (22.3 ppg.),
rebounds (9.6) and active player shoot-
ing percentage (.614). (Duke freshman
Elton Brand, who is out for the season
with a broken foot, technically leads the
conference in shooting percentage.)

Carter, my choice for college bas-
-ketba1l’s most exciting player, can put
the ball in the hoop from anywhere on
the court, above or below the rim.

Carter shoots an amazing .629 from
the field, averages 15.7 points per game
and also grabs five rebounds a game.

Williams, a dead-eye shooter, is
averaging 15.4 points and is money
from the free throw line, shooting 89
percent, tops in the conference.

Duke, averaging a conference—1ead— _

ing 90.3 points per game, counters
UNC’s scoring machine with junior
Trajon Langdon’s 14.5 points per
game. '

Steve Wojciechowski, Roshown
McLeod, Mike Chappell, Shane Battier
and Chris Burgess round out
Krzyzewski’s crew of devils who will
be looking to knock off their biggest
rivals.

This game marks the 199th meet-

- ing between the two foes.

North Carolina has won eight of the
past nine meetings. '
The two have played 28 times

when they are both in the top 10, and

they are knotted at 14-14, but the home
team leads with a 13-8 mark. Seven
games have been played at neutral sites.
What does all of this mean, you
ask? - ‘

Not much. .

It doesn’t matter who leads the con-
ference in what category.

It doesn’t matter that Coach Gut is
coaching his first game against Duke
without Dean Smith.

It doesn’t matter that Wojo is a lit-
tle punk who will get swallowed by
Williams and ACC assists-leader Ed
Cota. ‘

Sorry, I strayed for a second there.
If you’ve read my columns in~the past,
