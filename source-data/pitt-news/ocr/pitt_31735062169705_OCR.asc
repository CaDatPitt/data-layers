 

At Noon

John Kenneth Galbraith, eco-

I nomist and author, will speak to-

morrow in the Student Union
Ballroom at noon.

The 60 year old Galbraith was
born in Canada and was grad-
uated from Ontario College of
Agriculture, part of the Univer-
sity of Toronto, in 1931. He then
matriculated at the University of
California, receiving in 1934 a
Ph.D. in agricultural economics.
Galbraith took a position at Har-
vard University as an instructor
and tutor, and shortly thereafter
became an American citizen.

In 1941, Franklin D. Roosevelt
appointed him de facto head of
the Office of Price Administra-
tion (OPA), placing the responsi-
bility for fixing the price of items
sold in the U.S. on Galbraith. By
1943 Galbraith left the OPA to
become part of the staff of For-
tune magazine.

After World. War II, Galbraith
returned to government. His work
included assessing the value of
U.S. strategic bombing attacks on
Germany and helping out in the
rehabilitation of the occupied
countries. After a brief return to
Fortune, Galbraith returned to
Harvard as a professor, where he
has been, between leaves of ab-
sence, since 1949. 7

After his return to Harvard,
Galbraith began to write exten-
sively. His early works include
The Affluent Society, The Great
Crash, 1929, Economics and the
Art of Controversy, and Ameri-
can Capitalism. Since 1959, Gal-
braith has written eight nonfic-
tion works, a novel, 32 magazine
articles, 54 book reviews, and
numerous lectures, as well as ma-
jor speeches for Lyndon Johnson
‘and Edward, Robert, and John F.
Kennedy.

Galbraith became one of JFK’s '

earliest supporters, continuing a
friendship with the Kennedy fam-
ily which Galbraith had started
with Joseph Kennedy, Jr. during
his first years at Harvard. He was
part of the Kennedy entourage at
the 1960 Democratic Convention
and campaigned extensively for
Kennedy during his election cam-
paign.

JFK appointed Galbraith to the
Indian ambassadorship, a p 0 st
which took him to New Delhi
from 1961-63. Kennedy later
praised his work there, saying,
“Galbraith was my best ambassa-
dorial appointment.” Galbraith
also wrote four books during his
tenure in India.

Ga1braith’s return to the Unit-
ed States in 1963 brought him into
close association with liberal pol-
itics and American foreign policy.
His novel The Triumph deals
with state department paralysis.
Galbraith’s role as head of the
Americans for Democratic Action
has made him a major source of
liberal opinion and antiwar criti-
cism.

Scheuler Cites Changing Society 7

by BILL ROSEN
Staff News Writer

“We have to understand blacks in our
society to know what is happening in the
world today," emphasized SG President
Ken Schueler as he addressed a crowd of
40 students in the SU Ballroom, Monday.

In response to the small crowd which
gathered to listen to one of the last speech-
es Schueler had to make as president of
SG, he said, “I prefera group this size.
Many important decisions have been made

Schueler then jumped into the main
idea of his address: that civil rights, stu-
dent power, and the new left organizations
of today are revolutionizing American so-
ciety.

Students of today, through the news me-
dia, television and radio, are continuously
made aware of the world around them.

News of the Middle East crisis, the Viet-

nam War, and the devaluation of the franc,
immediately reach the student’s ear where-
as in 1960 many students did not even know
where Korea was.

Schueler pointed to t-he Living Theatre

and the Guerilla Theatre, as those playing
in the streets of Harlem and Bedford-Stuy-
vesant,as additional mechanisms for mak-
ing people aware of themselves.

- Schueler further pointed to the students
of the sixties who, after working for organ-
izations as SNICK and CORE, returned to
their own schools in the North only to find
students being denied certain civil liber-
ties.’ 9

After several unsuccessful years of try-
ing to pass reform legislation in the uni-
versities, students began to use more vio-
lent methods such as demonstrations and

at this University by a meeting of 15 peo-
. ple. -

 

confrontations. Clear examples of these
were seen at Columbia, Berkely, and San
Francisco State College.

According to Schueler, the New Left is
operating on three levels: moral, political,
and existential.

From the moral standpoint, students re-

fuse to listen to lies from their leaders, as
. a result of their living through Eisenhow-

er’s cover up of the U-2 incident or the
CIA’s snow job on the Bay of Pigs fiasco.

From the political standpoint, students
are demanding solutions to the problems of

the American society, such as poverty, ra-

cism, and the Vietnam War.

From the existential viewpoint, students
want to be granted their civil rights, such
as freedom of speech, as guaranteed by the
Bill of Rights. In addition, students want‘
to be recognized as individuals and refuse
to be treated as subordinates.

Schueler then indicated that a definite
structure has developed in nation wide stu-
dentpolitical tactics. First, and issue is
created—for example, the morality issue of
using napalm in Vietnam.. Then, demon-
strations are staged, as was against the Dow
Chemical Co., the makers of the chemical.
Then, when the policeandvUniversity sup-
press the demonstrators, the issueis rede-
fined in terms of suppressing the freedom
of speech and the role of the University in
society. ' ' '"

A question was raised about student
apathy towards SG. In response, Schueler

said, “The position of SG has to be strength-,

ened so the students will have confidence
in that government. They will have to be
convinced that if they want to do some-
thing, they are in the position to do it.

Schueler stressed that students must gain,
control over themselves. Students did not
want to become involved in organizations

such as MDC or SG because_they knew.

KEN SCHEULER

these organizations were puppets of the ad-_—_ 6 

ministration and the students really had lit-_ 6, 

tle say in matters.

The administration knows that they can 
not continue to rule students’ social or mo_r- 1'
al behavior. The “No Curfews” rule is an‘ ‘

result of this knowledge. As Schueler stat-

ed, “The administration has realized that 
intercourse does not only occur after 2:30 1' ‘

a.m.

Fortunately, through the work of SG, If

organizations are beginning to break their

strings with the administration and stu-..
dents are beginning to have a say in how’

this university is run.

 Dr. King spoke before 2,000 persons

Uncle Sam Wants Me A

 

by PAUL STOLLER
Editor, The Pitt News

Uncle Sam wants me.

He wants to take me in his arms, slap
my face, destroy my individuality, break
me down physically, and mold me into a
different person—a person who does ex-
actly what he is told. He wants to throw
away my educational talentsain order tha
I be physically and emo- ’- 
tionally ready to clean
latrines, m ow Colonel
lawns, and kill human ,
beings, if the need pre-
sents itself in the hell- 
is_h theatre of war. 1

IT MAKES NO dif-
ference if I don’t parti-
cularly like to clean la-  "
trines. or kill people in MR- STOLI-ER
that war. I am obligated, in spite of my
philosophical leanings, to be a minute part
of that bureaucratic monster, the United
States military.

Uncle Louis’ hot breath bothers me
more and more as time goes by. My neckv
is becoming stiff from the constant ten-
sion. I am becoming depressed about that
giant roadblock in my 1ife—-the draft.

’ Like all graduating seniors, my room
at home iscluttered with all sorts of appli-
cations. There are the applications to.grad-
uate school. And on each application, a
smallsection asks the applicant his mili-

    

tary status. Have you been in the armed
forces? Do you have a deferment‘? Are
you in a reserve unit‘? In all cases. my
answer is no.

MOM AND DAD keep telling me to
make a decision——the sooner the better. Dad
thinks I should become an officer in either
the Army or Navy. Mom says I should get
myself a teaching job. She’s very much
afraid of her son participating in the war
in Vietnam.

Some of my friends have suggested the
Peace Corps. Some people say VISTA is
the thing. My aunt tells me that I should
spend six years in the reserve. And some
blind optimists tell me not to worry about
the draft. “You’ve got to live a normal life;
you‘ve got to do exactly what you want, in
spite of Uncle Louis.

Well, I still want to attend a graduate
school. But how can I? If I do go into the
military, and buckle under, the graduate
schools will uphold my acceptance. But
what happens if I want to teach? What
happens if I go into the Peace Corps or
VISTA. I guess I can reapply after one,
maybe two or maybe four years.

'1 USED TO BE excited about graduate
education. But now it’s such a distant

dream that my former excitment has trans-'

formed itself into passivity.

So many distant thoughts and dreams
are flowing through my mind. I'm tired of
sweating it out.

Goddam I’m confused.

 

  Drug Use

 

There is an old cliche that a word to
the wise is sufficient. Let’s hope so.

(Yesterday on the news it was announc-

ed that two Point Park students were found ‘

by agents with $8,000 to $10,000 worth of
drugs in their apartment.

This is the eighth raid in the local area
within the past month. ‘
Numerous raids w e r e
.made over the Christ-
mas holidays, and all
the raids seem to bethe
result of two or three
months of investigation ‘
by the city Vice Control
Squad.

THESE R‘*AIDS seem
to bear fruit to the many’
rumors that have been circulating around
this campus and the Oakland district since
school began in September. Some of these
rumors are : T

—Students enrolled in the undergrad-
uate and graduate programs have been con-
tacted by the local police and the FBI.

—A few agents have been enrolled in
the University as students and are work-
ing with the contacted students and local
police.

ALTHOUGH THE attitude of the ma-

jorit_y__of students that some drugs are un-
thorities still frown on drug usage and p.os-

spread to many adults and parents, the au-
' harmful if used in the proper amounts has

 

 

: Today’ 3 Quote

IS Illegal

SGSSIOII.

Students may feel that because their
peers and some of the adults accept the
controlled use of drugs, there is no harm
in using and possessing them.

This is not to say “now be good little
boys and girls”; I realize you are all old
enough to think for yourselves.

WHAT I DO want to do, is impress
upon you the importance of not getting
caught. If you must use drugs, and don't
give a damn about your fellow students,
whether or not they use drugs, this is just
a reminder that the heat is on and that
maximum security is of the utmost impor-
tance to all concerned.

The heat is not only being applied here
in Pittsburgh, but on a state-wide and na-
tion-wide level as well.

EVIDENTLY, THE local bar owners
are paying off the LCB as the numbers
racketeers have paid off the police in the
past. But there is no powerful element to
pay the police to turn their heads the other
way,in light of the nation-wide increase
in drug usage.

_What I am saying is that those persons
using drugs are going it alone against not
only the local police, but the FBI and any
students they can talk into giving them
the assistance they need to gain informa-
tion. ' .

Keep this in mind, and cool it until the
heatif off. -

 

Chancellor Wesley Posvar issued this statement af-
ter Dr. Martin Luther King was killed:

The students, faculty and staff of the University of
Pittsburgh share with all Americans a profound sense of
loss at the death of Dr. Martin Luther King.

This good, vital and selfless man, whose life reflect-
ed so clearly the most fundamental values on which our
society is founded, ‘did more than anyone to make us
aware of_ the need to put social justice into practice, as
well as to profess it as a principle. .

If his death is to have significance, we’ must renew
our dedication to the achievement through non,-violent

means of complete social equality and justice for all
Americans regardless, of race or color. . ' '

‘I Have A Dream,’
Said God’s Minister

By DON MARBURY

“I have a dream, a dream of a Negro and white
child walking hand in hand without fear, or with-
out prejudice.” Martin Luther King, minister of
the word of God, advocate of the equality of all
persons, and a man, was shot to death Thursday
as he stood on the veranda of his motel.

     

 

Disbelief, pain, and intense hatr3d, were my
first reactions when I heard of his death. Then
after awhile all I could feel was pity for the per-»
son who had decided to become God and decide
the death of a fellow human being. I pitied the mind
of a person who could do a thing like.this. I pitied
him for the hate that he must have had, to do some-
thing like this, and I pitied him, for being unable
to control the forces that could drive him to such
an act. I wondered does he really feel that he has
done any good or solved anything?

Confusion. Speculation. Fear. All were ati.thei.ii-; '.
front Friday; they saturated your emotions. For 
aman who stood for all men had died. ’ ' . 

' Dr. Martin Luther King.

And for the second time since the late fall of" 
1963, a great American had been murdered. Again" 
the assasin’s xullet had dealt a lethal blow to the_}_, 
American system.  

For America, it was not enough to lose" Pre_'_s-”,-Cf

Martin Luther King was a man who believed
in one basic principle that probably all of us have
heard at one time or another, “All men are created
equal in the eyes of the creator.” Sometimes when
I hear the words “nigger” and “hunky” I am just
completely baffled. This has been asked so many
times before but why, just why does the color of ‘
a person’s skin or what he believes inmake him any
different, or less a person than anyone else?

‘Dr. Martin Luther King

We’re all people aren’t we? If
cut, don’t we all bleed‘?-Don’t
all of us long for the same things,
happiness, prosperity, love, a
wife and family? Then why? Why
can’t I walk down Forbes Ave.
with a white girl without both the
members of my race, and the
white race, showing their con-
tempt for the two of us?

1

Sometimes I go someplace by
myself and ask myself, “Oh,
dear God, why is there so much
hate and prejudice in the World?
Why is everyone referred to as
belonging to a race; the white
race, or the Negro race, or the
Jewish nation‘? Why can’t we all
be one big race, where it doesn’t
matter if we are white, black or
yellow?” As one may have gath-
ered, my dreams are also very
idealistic.

The Pitt News commemorates the birthday of Dr. Martin
Luther King by reprinting this special supplement ‘published fol-
lowing his assassination‘ last April 8.

At the time, this supplement was dedicated to Dr. King’s
dream, that:

 

“One day in the Red Hills of Georgia, sons of former slaves

and sons of former slave-owners‘ will sit down together at the table
of brotherhood.”

  

 He Saw Promised Land From The Mountain

- ours. lacmnethe

 
 
  

He had a mission to follow; he_had amountain to
climb andhe climbed the mountain and he saw the

beauty of the future lying in the valley below. “Mine eyes‘

have seen the coming of the Lord,” he sand. And now
‘he shall rest as all good men rest.

Dr. Martin Luther King had faith in mankind. He
maintained his faith even though men continued to. kill
each other. Never once did Martin Luther King suggest
that‘ man should lift up his hands against his fellowman. In-
stead, Dr. King was a man of peace, a man of courage
and a man of non-violence. -

Above all, Dr. King had a dream—a dream that all
men, black and white, Jew and Gentile, Protestant and
Catholic would one day walk hand and hand.

He dreamed of the day when all children, black "and
white, could walk down any street in the south, north,
west or east and -not judge each other by their color of
their skin but by the content of their character.

But the beautiful words of this man will be heard no
longer; he shall no longer walk at the head of great mar-
ches for he is dead. Yet, Martin Luther King’s memory
will never die; his memory will live on in the hearts
and minds of men for ages to come fo.r his message was
one of hope and vision. And one day in the future, we will
look back to the courageous life of Martin Luther King and
we will say that he was right; we will say that he saw the
light of truth, and then we will know the path that we must
follow. --

And that path is the road to understanding—the road to
communication. The road will be rocky and White Ameri-
cans will have to be its travelers for we are at fault. We
are the ones who are the elite of this racist society of

  

castiga-
tors and the perpetrators. And
we are the ones who must be
moved by the life work of Dr.
King.

Both blacks and whites must
now as never before take heed
of Dr. King’s life work. All
Americans in this timeof need
and sorrow must be prepared
to face the ultimate truth—and
we must face ourselves as hu-
man beings. People must now
look at themselves and find the
true meaning of brotherhood.

More than anything all of
us must have faith in ourselves
and our fellow man. Man is a . ._  
subjective animal—a being that   "
can rationally choose between V ~  V ~ -
two alternatives. Being. Being a subjective animal, man
has inherent faith. Faith in God and faith in his fellow
man. If there is one thing, that ‘Dr. King wanted to bring
to light during his life it was that ultimately man will
y man will
not only learn to live with himself but also with his neigh-
bor be he black, white, yellow, or red. This is the message
of Dr. Martin Luther King. It is a message for all of us;
a message of the future; a message of hope and determin-
ation; a message of pride in mankind. ’

Today is the time of mourning but tomorrow will be
the time of rememberance. A great man never dies, for
his words and his visions live eternally. '

Secret Interview with Coaching Candidate Printed

by ROY JACOBS
Sports Editor
Recently, the Pitt News learned of
an interview with another candidate
for the head football coach position.
That interview is reprinted here, al-
though the candidate asked to remain
anonymous. We can say, though, that
he is well known, but not as a football
coach.
Q: Why hasn’t Pitt chosen its new
coach yet? '
I A: There’s small choice in rotten
apples (Taming of the Shrew). .
Q: What is the rush in getting a new
coach?
A: Lest the bargain should catch
cold and starve (Cymbeline).
Q: Why is college coaching such an in-
secure profession?
A: Some rise by sin, and some by
virtue fall (Measure for Measure).

Q: What is the secret of good coaching?
A: Some a re born great, so m e
achieve greatness, and some have great-

\ ness thrust upon them (Twelfth-Night ).

Q: What do you think about Pitt’s ap-
proach to solving its problems?
A: It is excellent to have a giant’s
strength; but it is tyrannous to use it
like a giant (Measure for Measure).

Q: How bad is the situation, though?

A: If this were played upon a stage
now, I could condemn it as an improb-
able fiction (Twelfth—Night).

Q: Could it be any worse?

A: The worst is not so long as we
can say, “This is the worst” (King
Lear).

Q: What can we expect from the cur-

rent approach? __

A: Nothing will come of nothing
(King Lear).

Q: But what about the future? Will

things get better?

A: If you have tears, prepare to shed
them now (Julius Caesar).

Q: Is there any hope for the future?

3 A: The miserable have other
medicine but only hope (Measure for
Measure).

Q: What is your philosophy for Pitt
' football?

A: To do a great right, do a little
wrong (Merchant of Venice).

Q: Any chance _of your visions coming

true?

A: As hard to come as for a camel
to thread the postern of a small nee-
dle’s eye (King Richard).

Q: Didn’t you once say that Pitt had a
great program?

A: My salad days, when I was green
in judgment (Antony and Cleopatra).

Q: Why didn’t you apply for the Pitt
job sooner?

A: The weakest kind of fruit drops
earliest to the ground (Merchant of
Venice).

Q: Do you think you can do as good a
job as Frank Kush would have done?

A: He does it with a better grace,
but I do it more natural (Twelfth-
Night).

Q: Do you think the attitude of the Pitt
officials has been rather nonchal-
ant during the search for a coach?

A: How oft when men are at the
point of death have they been merry
(Romeo and Juliet). ‘

Q: Let’s talk about some of the speci-
fics at Pitt. What about the prac-
tice facilities?

A: Now would I give. a thousand fur-
longs of sea for an a cre of barren
ground (The Tempest).

Q: What about the four-school agree-

ment?

A: It is a custom more honored in
the breach than the observance (Ham-
let).

Q: Will one-platoon football come back

into vogue?

A: The Law hath not been dead,
though it hath slept (Measure for Meas-
ure).

Q: Are the coaching salaries sufficient

to attract a good staff here?

A: He is well paid that is well sat-
isfied (Merchant of Venice).

Q: Did you know that the sports editor
of the Pitt News has been crusad-
ing for football reforms?

A: I never knew so younga body
with so old a head (Merchant of Ven-
ice). .

End to Streak Not Probable I

Against Temple In Palestra

By ROY JACOBS

The last time the basketball team visited Temple at the Pa-
lestra, they lost by 38 points, 87-49. Currently riding a seven
game losing streak, the cagers won’t find an easy answer to winning “

tonight when they face the revenge—minded Owls in Philadelphia (7:00,

WPGH ).

Last year, an over-confident
Temple squad visited Fitzger-
ald Field House and was upset,
80-63, by a Panther quintet that
wasto win only seven games.
Owl coach Harry Litwack is not
likely to let that happen again.
But hoop coach Buzz Ridl is still
hoping.

“We hope to do it again,” re-
marked Ridl. “We have a chance
to win. If we didn’t, we wouldn’t
play.” The mentor is hoping that

his squad continues the fine

shooting it exhibited in the sec-
ond half Saturday against George
Washington (49 per cent). Ac-
tually, in the final 28 minutes,
the cagers outscored G-W, 53-46.
They lost, 92-68.

Temple has a veteran squad,
losing only stand-out guard Clar-
ence Brookins to graduation. Al-
though the Owls’ record includes

' four losses, two of those were

one-pointers (Army and Wake
Forest), and the others were
close games with nationally rank-
ed New Mexico and Detroit.

“Temple will probably give us
a lot of pressure,” predicted
Ridl after watching George
Washington’s 1-3-1 zone rattle
his squad. The Owls have two
quick guards in Drew Nolan and
Tony Brocchi to provide the pres-
sure, while the Palestra crowd
noise (especially with Villanova
playing in the second game) can
unnerve any visitor.

Still, any key to beating the
Owls would include stopping
John Baum. He is their outstand-
ing ball-player and a candidate
for All-East honors as a 6-5 for-
ward. Last year’s surprise,
Baum averaged 18.1 points and

, 11.9 rebounds a game and out-

shone vBrookins on Litwack’s
NIT squad. This year he picked
up where he left off.

Aiding Baum up front are 6-5
forward Joe Cromer, who was
slow starting this year after a
fine junior year and 6-8 center
Ed Mast. Sophomore forward
Jack Kirschling (6-5) ‘came into

 

his own during the holidays and
may be ready for a really big
game.

Ridl expects to use guard Bob
Petrini and forward Mike Riggle
a little more tonight than so far

‘this season. Petrini is just com-

ing back from a back injury, while
Riggle will spell puzzling junior
Mike Patcher. Rob McFarland
(25 points) had a fine game
against G-W, but he’ll need an-
other if the cagers are to pull
their second straight upset over
Temple.

ROB MCFARLAND
Another Big Effort Needed

Robert Morris Overpowers

Green Frosh, 83-68 for
First Defeat of the Season

By BILL N AAB

' The Panther basketball Cubs played their most impressive
game to date Monday night, although their sensational effort

was lost in defeat. The Robert Morris Colonials

gym overpowered the Cubs, 83-68.

in their Moon Twp.

The victory was Robert Morris’ 12th straight. The Cubs are

now 2-1. Tim Grgurich’s squad
knew that the odds were against
them — height and experience -
but still fought to keep a slim
lead until the last eight minutes
of the first half.

. Bob Cizmarik who played his
best game yet and scored 22
points struck. quickly the first
three times the Cubs had the
ball. And after Rod Schoon hit
on a free throw and a field goal
and Steve Lewis drove for a buck-
et, the Cubs held their biggest
lead of the night, 12-8.

Still, even with a slight lead it
was apparent that the Cubs were
.in for a rough night under the
boards. The Colonials’ 6’10”
center, Larry Ketvirtis and team-
mate Dave Werthman seldom let
the Cubs have more than one shot.

Moreover, the Colonials exhib-
ited professional passing ability,
played a sneaky tight defense,
and had offensive star Perry

Johnson 25 points hitting from
nearly everywhere on the court.
Johnson more than once drew
whistles and oohs and ahs from
the jam-packed crowd. He had a

high-arching shot which was just -

about impossible to stop and was
also tricky on his drives.

Playmaker Cleveland Edwards
did a commendable job dribbling
and passing in ‘freeze’ situations.
However, it was big Bob Jones
who surprised the rival Cubs.
“Jones was the man who really
hurt you with his inside moves,”
pointed out West Virginia Coach
Bucky Waters, who was scout-
ing Edwards.

After ,trailing 42-34 at half-
time, the closest the Cubs could
get was 63-58 with 8:38 remain-

Situation: Complete design scheme for tools,
jigs, and ﬁxtures needed. Also
need plans detailing how much time
will be required, under optimum
conditions, for line changeover.‘

Question: Is there some way we can
