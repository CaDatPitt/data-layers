To you who were here and

much you could be ‘missed. For
you left here many friendships,
-the kind that are more than
utmost goodwill, and those
friendships do not rust. In spite
of fog something you left here
is still fresh and fair—a respect
for you like the respect for an

Wave for Job

Ensign Alma Luoise Nicholas is
now stationed at the United States
Naval hospital in Philadelphia
where her duties include the giv-
ing of psychological tests. Ensign
Nicholas entered the WAVES
February 1, 1944, and received her
indoctrination training at Smith
college. After she received her
commission, she had six weeks
special training -at the Philadel-
phia Naval hospital. This training
plus her major in psychology at
Pitt ﬁtted her for work in the psy-
chology department.

While at Pitt Ensign Nicholas
was vice-president of WSGA, a
member of Senior Court and
Mortar Board, and a nominee for
senior queen. As an undergraduate
she was a member of Cwens,

mittee.

It/lrmy Nurse Becker Prefers

‘Riding English bicycles was “something new” for Lt. Dorothy
Jones Becker of the army nurses corps, who had always been used

to the good old U. S. A. type.

In a letter to the folks back home, Lt.

Becker wrote, “A friend and I took a bicycle ride and got ourselves

lost and traveled sixteen miles before we got back.

Frost Training
In Liherators

At Air Base

Captain Robert Ellis Frost of
the Army Air Forces, a graduate
of the School of Business Adminis-
tration, Class of 1940, is new
training in Liberator bombers at
Fort Worth, Texas. He was sent
there two months ago after having
spent a year and a half as an
instructor a-t Ellington Field,
Texas. There he taught the pilot

cadets already graduated from
primary and basic schools the
technique of ﬂying twin-engine

trainers, advanced instrument ﬂy-
ing, formation technique, and
night ﬂying. Captain Frost de-
scribed these various phases of
training in his article Mission
Competed in last year’s winter
number of The Alumni Review.

Until his transfer -to the Army
Air Corps in February, 1942, Cap-
tain Frost received training in the
anti-aircraft artillery at For-t Eus-
tis, Tex-as, his basic a-t Durant,
Oklahoma, and his advanced a-t
Randolph Field, Texas. For a
short time following this last
phase 'he trained in the Liberat-
ors at Fort Worth but was soon
chosen to be an instructor at
Ellington Field.

While attending the University,
Captain Frost was the student
manager of the football team and
arranged for the West coast trip
at the time of the Pitt-Washing-
ton game. Prior to his entry into
the army as a reserve oﬁicer in
October, 1941, Captain Frost was
an employee of the Transconti-
nental Western Airlines in Pitts-
burgh.

Caotain Frost’s -father, Dr. Ellis
M. Frost, was graduated from
Pitt in 1905. Dr. Albert Ellis Frost,
grandfather of Captain Frost,
came to the University as profes-
sor of physics in 1885 and served
for 32 years. An uncle, Albert
Frost Dalbey, an aunt, Helen Frost

a -sister, Elizabeth Frost Pierson,
are all alumni of the University.

Pharmacy Students
Keep in Touch

Men and women from the
School of Pharmacy who are in
the service keep in touch with the
School through letters to faculty
members and friends. No matter
how long ago they graduated, or
how they may be_ from Pittsburgh,
-many former students send mes-
sages from such places as: India,
;.Burma, Italy, Romania, Egypt, and
New Guinea.

Just the men and women in
service keep in contact with the
School, students and faculty write
to them through the News Letter.
This phamphlet is sent to all
service people. It lists the names
of service men and women, gives
news about them, and keeps them
posted on the activities of the
School.

Foreign Pitt Clubs
Dot War Theatres

Like Topsy,_ Pitt clubs “just
growed” since Theodore Biddle,
dean of men, ﬁrst conceived the
idea» to place in mythical clubs the
former Pitt students who are
overseas. The Pitt clubs are
organizations in name only, since
there are no officers, no meetings,
and no dues.

New members are listed on the
back of the four-to-ﬁve-page
newsletter which Dean Biddle
sends to the overseas men every
eight weeks. When he receives a
letter from a former student,
Dean Biddle automatically enters
the same in a Pitt club and sends
the .writer a newsletter.

Pitt clubs include Alaska, Atlan-
tic, Australia, Canal Zone, Carib-
mean, China Burma-India, Ha-
waii, Ireland, Italy, England, Ice-
land, Greenland, Mediterranean,
Africa, Far Paciﬁc, South Paciﬁc,
and French areas.

Pitt Alumni Serve
In Armed Forces

Several alumni of the School of
Applied Social Sciences in the
armed forces have reported their
activities by letter. Pvt. Laurie
Billstone does consultation service
work -at Greensboro, N. C.; Lt.
(j. g.) Stanley Brody writes that
he is working for ﬂeet post of-
ﬁce on a ship on convoy duty.

Tech. Sgt. Leonard R-ohmer, is
stationed at Ft. Meade, Md.; and
Sgt. Irving Gold serves with the
infantry in England. Cpl. Herman
Davidson reports that he is serv-
ing with the First Aircraft Main-
tenance unit at Brookley ﬁeld,
Alabama.

Not in the armed services, but
with the American Red Cross
overseas is SASS alumna Virginia
S. Williamson.

Approximately 850 alumni of
the School of Dentistry are in the
armed forces of their country.

Four of Pitt’s Dental School
alumni who have lost their lives
while in service are Major R.obert
M. Bell, ’28; Captain Joseph M.
Levine, ’36; -Captain James C.
Forney, ’38; and Lt. Francis D.
Brantlinger, ’28.

Pitt’ ASTR Program Ends;
115 Reserves Move 

0 State

With the transfer of 115 men
to Penn State for the third term
of their training the Army ‘Spec-
ialized Training Reserve program
here at Pitt terminated on Decem-
ber 2, l944. -Concurrently with
the end of the ASTRP at Pitt, 54
men of the AST have graduated
from the pre-med curriculum and

most of them "will be admitted to‘

various medical schools some-
time during 1945. Meanwhile, they
have been ordered to duty at
Army hospitals for the interim
period.

The ASTRP men originally
came here last June. In Septem-
ber, at the conclusion of thewfirst
term, they were given a week’s
furlough at home, prior to the
beginning of the second term
which terminated December 2. In
addition to the 115 men who are
being transferred for a thirl term,
four of the original 201 who be-
gan the program, are being sent
home because they will reach the
age of eighteen years and six
months prior to the end of the
third term. While at home, they
will await call to active duty
some time in January.

The remaining men either with-
drew from the program or were
separated for academic reasons.
During the six months duration of
the program, only three men were
separated for disciplinary reasons.

Pitt was named one of the ﬁrst
schools in the nation to train
young men for the ASTRP last
spring. In order to enlist in this
program, the men must be seven-
teen years old but not over seven-
teen fears and nine months. Thef
are feed, clothed, housed, and
have their tuition paid by the War
Department. They have the priv-
ilege of withdrawing at any
time, but doing so bars them from
ever entering the AST program.
When called to active duty, they
go into the Army Air corps and
go through the regular training
program. Although they are in the
ASTRP, they are essentially civ-
ilians until called to active duty.

 

Help needed to mail the serv-
icemen’s issue. Won’t you please
please come to the 8th ﬂ-oor to-
day, and the rest of this week,
in your spare time.

Gratefully,
The Pitt News staff.

Dearest Joe,-
Ther-e is so little you can put in

these V-mails, Joe, but I'd like

to tell you a little about how the
Pitt girls are waiting for you
fellows to come back.

The man situation around here
is as changeable and unpredict-
able as the, question of where
you'll be stationed next week.
Last year, -the ASTPs were wel-
come guests in the Cathedral, and
the girls" dragged out the nail
polish and the last old pair of
nylons, with a glad cry. We even
tried that new hair-do we’d ‘been
admiring so long. Such fun! . .. .
but not for long. Now the ASTPs
have gone with the breeze, and
we are once" more having “hen
dates,” come Saturday p. m., and
playing bridge with the girls.
Browning, Keats, and the cultural
side of life once more claim our
undivided and rapt attention.
(Well, practically.) We
bushels of letters, and then brush
up on our geography so we can
discuss your wher-eabouts more
intelligently. jWe still buy the
latest records, but Dorsey's not
much fun without you, Joe.

I don’t believe the libraries at
Pitt will ever replace the Tuck
Shops, but at present, they cer-
tainly are being rushed by the
girls, to study and to dash off
notes to you...

. . . All of which means, we
miss you. We're looking forward
as much as you -to the day when

write '

we can meet you again in the.

Commons room, sing Christmas
carols together by the fireplaces,
and maybe drink some tea.» Some
smoggy afternoon, V
away, we’ve a date wi-th
again, Joe.

At Commencements

Commencement at Pitt is an

impressive experience remem-ber-
ed by thousands of Pitt graduates
in service. Two graduating classes,
those of 1932 and 19:43, have per-
haps the proudest memories. For
Pitt’s guest speakers at com-
mencement those years were two

» of today’s greatest military lead-

ers, General Douglas MacArthur
and Admiral Randall Jacobs,
respectively.

Although his audience did not
realize it until much later, Gen-
eral MacArthur’s address of 1932
was pure prophecy. He asked that
we guard against -the insidious

_paciﬁsm which certain societies

and organizations were spreading
at that time, and warned that
“Those who preach by word or
deed, ‘peace at. any price,’ either
do not have anything worth

" ‘zndefending or believe nothing they
have

is worth defending. Such
peopledeny their resp-onsibilities.
. Paciﬁsm is not the same as
love of peace. It is inactive, a,
refusal to protec-t."
He asked that we remember
the world societies which have

I » fallen despite their wealth, wis-

dom, and culture, because they

‘ chose to ignore the possibility of
‘ aggression. yHe said that there is

little in our institutions worth
having or worth perpetuating
which has not been defended by
armed men.

Many of those who graduated

‘on June 2,1943, were serving in
 the armed forces, or enlisted and
' ‘were awaiting call. Admiral

Jacobs, who received the degree

"of Doctor of Laws at the Com-
"  mencement ‘gexercises, delivered an
‘ ' outstanding address that day in
 V, the Soldiers and Sailors memo-
"trial. He praised Pitt’s history of
4  scholarship V‘ and companionship,
' ‘her Cathedral with its nationality
‘ "classrooms, and her opportunities.

The admiral aﬂirmed: “It is to

I

your generation that the decent
world entrusts, its very existence.
Your colleagues in the air, on the
battleﬁelds and in the ﬂeets dis-
tinguish themselves daily. Today’s
world is their world.”

He concluded: “With strength
in the knowledge you have ac-
quired from your alma mater,
with faith in our way of life,
I urge you to use your aptitude
to develop the capacity of leader-
ship that lies within the grasp
of each one of you. By such a
development you will maintain
today’s -troubled world and have
the opportunity to rea-p the bene-
ﬁts -of tomorrow’s promised
worl .”

--Sweet‘ am! [aw-flown-.1 

By Arnold Steinma.n
This week I would like to bring; sniper’s bullet and now he has

music a little closer to home——to
Pitt in (fact. In as much as Sweet
and Low—Down is devoted to the
ﬁeld of popular music, today I
thought that it would be nice to
tell a little about some of the stu-
dents in Pitt and some of the very
recent students at the University
who have played in the same
dance bands as I in the last few
years. It is very possible that a
few fellows have been missed, but
I am simply telling of those with
whom I am best acquainted. After
looking down the list I am sure
that you will admit that the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh has had more
than its share of ﬁne musician-
ship.

First of all there is Bob Lazar.
Bob was one of Pitt’s outstanding
juniors when he joined up with
Uncle Sam’s navy. He was a mem-
ber of Pi Lambda ‘Phi, Druids, and
like most of the fellows on this list
he played in the Pitt band. Bob
was never seen without his bas-
soon, baton, or slide rule. His
band, which was really on the
road to success when he left,
played several lengthy engage-
ments at the Balconades and
various country -clubs in the city,
and contained several musicians
that are now playing in some of
the nation’s top-ﬂight bands._

Next we have Ray Crummie.
Like Bob Lazar, Ray was an en-
gineer but is now a member of the
United ‘States Navy. He was a Phi
Delt and had the status of senior
when he was tapped (USN ). Ray
had several good offers from name
bands but school came ﬁrst and
anyway he was having too much
fun playing piano, ﬁrst with Skip
Strahl’s orchestra and then later
with Brad Hunt’s. Oh, by the way,
Ray was recently engaged to Miss
Jeannie Regal, terriﬁc singer now
with Brad Hunt.

Do you all remember the Pitt
High Hatter’s orchestra (Oh! those
trips we took up to Penn State!)
headed by trombonist Miller Wus-
lich. Well, the next three men
and yours truly played in that
orchestra until it broke up, and
Miller joined, -Charlie Spivak down
at the Stanley for a short time un-
til he left for the army. Well, to
continue the story, it seems that
several weeks ago in France Mil-
ler’s leg got into the way of a

been awarded the Purple Heart.‘

My only comment is that if Miller
could take those mad trips up to
State in the back of a truck with
twelve guys and a card table, he
can take anything.

Then there were the King boys.
Bill King played trumpet, and
Murray King played alto saxo-
phone. Outside of playing with
the Pitt High Hatter’s an-d the U.
S. Army they are not related the
slightest bit. Bill came back to
Pitt for a while last year in one
of the army programs, and I be-
lieve he will always be remem-
bered 'for his corn cob humor;
while Murray, quite in contrast,
will be remembered as the
smoothie of the band. ‘Murray was
a member of Lambda Chi here at
Pitt. _

Bob Sea-man has just come back
to Pitt this semester. He is at-soph-
omore in the School of Business
Administration and now he is only
devoting part time to his trum-
pet playing which has been heard
all over the country. The names
of the bands that he has played
in would stretch all the way from
the Commons Room to the Tri-

Delt house. Just to mention a '

very few, Tommy Carlyn, Maurice
Spitalny, and the radio staff or-
chestras in town, while one of the
out-of-town band-leaders B ob
has played for is that drummer
man, Gene Krupa, You won’t be-
lieve it but Bob’s ambition is to
be a pearl diver in the Coral
islands. Wow!

We must not forget my boy Russ
Campbell. Russ was a sophomore
pre-med when he entered the
navy. From the latest reports he
is playing saxophone in the navy
dance band at -Bainbridge. Before
he left he was playing hot tenor

sax in Bra~d’s band and also held‘.

his own in some of the jazz com-
bos around town. Russ transferred
to Pitt after his ﬁrst year at Penn
State where he was a Sigma Nu.
His greatest desire was to attend
Medical School at Pitt, and I hope
he will be one of the many fel-
lows who rejoin us at good old
Pitt after the war.

L Well there we have it; the space
is all gone. See you next week
when we start our annual poll for
all your favorite
band leaders.

Mr. Barnhart o-f Ye Olde Pitt-.
pourri says. that I couldn't write»
a good lead if -my life depended
on it, so rather than try to be
clever I’ll just open up by saying
that this column is dedicated to

all Pitt Frat men, wherever they,

may be.

The Delts are keeping up all
of the old traditions of the house..
They had their annual Bowery»

Brawl last Saturday evening,
much to the pledges delight. To

those of you who are in the dark‘

about Delt traditi-ons, at the Bow-
ery Brawl the pledges become
brothers, and the brothers lead a
dog's life for a nigh-t.

The Phi Delts are still making
a hit with the women’s frater-
nities. Last week they entertained
the Karppas at their house with a
tea dance. Tea dancing has be-
come the most popular social
event on -the Pitt campus.

The Phi Eps initiated. seven
new brothers over the weekend.
The newest Phi Eps are Bob
Harris, Bob Pearlman, Larry
Bondy, Eddie Citron, Alex Smith,
Jack Greenburg, and David Reis-
berg.

The Phi Gams are planning a
four way affair along with the
Phi Kappas, TPAs, and Kappas.
This goes along with the “Fra-
ternity ‘Good Neighbor Policy,”
and all concerned are hoping that
it goes over.

"Speaking of the Phi Kappas,
they were recently admitted to
active status. in IF Council again
after a long absence. Here’s wish-
ing them good luck for the future.

The Pi Lams are being treated
to a dance by their pledges this
weekend. The pledges are han-
dling all the details, and all the
brothers have to do is have a good
time, and we’re sure they will.

The SAEs are keeping up their
traditions of losing a President a
month. Last month it was Bob
Richardson, and this month it’s
Eugene Holohan. The new presi-
dent is Bob Delasin, and he’s
hoping to last more than a month.
Another SAE who is going the
way of most good Pitt men is Al
Phillips. Al is leaving for the
service today.

The Sigma Chis are making big
plans for a Christmas dance to be
held sometime during Christmas
vacation. They’re looking forward
to the dance, and we're looking
forward to -the vacation.

Thanksgiving was celebrated at
the AE Phi apartment with a pa-
jama party. Need I say that there
were pillow ﬁghts, food, and lots
of entertainment. The afternoon
was spent at the football game.

On Sunday, the TPAs initiated
Tillie Sanker and Vivian Hans-
berry. The initiation ritual began
at St. Paul's Cathedral, and was
followed by breakfast at the Fair-
fax dining room. T

Gibian at Home
I n France

Pvt. George Gibian is very
much at home with the infantry
in France, where he spent some
time in school before coming to
the United States. Since he is the
only one
speaks ﬂuent French, he has been
given the job as interpreter, a job
which he likes since it gives him
a chance t-o talk with the friendly
and enthusiastic French people.
He writes about one verbal alt-
tack, “They ‘are very glad to ﬁnd
somebody who understands them,
and let loose a flow of language
and hand—waving to such an
extent, that once a buddy who
was with me "tried to drag me
away from a most friendly con-
versation," thinking from the
French inﬂection and hand-wav-
ing that I was getting into a ﬁght.”

He also writes some things that
could have been taken from one
of Mauldin’s cartoons, “The
natives are most friendly and they
all wave, give the "V" ﬁnger sign,
and throw even flowers and bou-
quets at us; sometimes they throw
apples and peaches inside our
trucks, and one has to watch one’s
head.”

George, who was born and
raised in Czecho.=.loval;ia, came to
the United States in 1940, and
was graduated from the college
with highest honor in 1943.

On All Battlefronts

Marine Lieutenant Bruce L.
Reuter, 22, a night ﬁghter pilot
whose Corsair squadr-on was the
ﬁrst Allied air unit 'to land in
the Marshalls, thus becoming the
ﬁrst to operate from Jap man-
dated soil, has returned -to this
country recently from the Central
Paciﬁc.

.L1eu:te-nant Reuter’s squadron
provided night cover for landing
forces in the invasions of Tinian
and -Gua-m in the Marianas. Prior
to moving up to Saipan, where
he ﬂew in 10 missions on J ap-held
Rota atoll, he was based at Tar-
awa in the Gilberts and Roi and
Eniwetok in the Marshalls.

Lieutenant Reuter said -that al-
though h-is squadron was bombed
on Tarawa, his most exciting ex-
perience came during the inva-
sion of Guam. “Watching our
navy task force shell the island
from -my night patrol was my
most «exciting combat experience
overseas,” he said. “My plane
was hit by Jap anti-aircraft ﬁre
during the attack, but I managed
to return Ito Saipan safely.”

Lieutenant Reuter graduated
from Aspinwall high school and
attended the University from the
fall of 1940 to the -end of the
spring semester in 1942. He was
enrolled in the School of Engi-
neering. Entering Marine avia-
tion in July, 1942, he won his
wings and commission a year
later at Pensacola, Fla., and
attained his present rank of ﬁrst
lieutenant last July.

.man, MC, USNR, has returned to

head of the medical section of
Navy Mobile Hospital No. 5,
and has been assigned to the U. S.
naval hospital at Chelsea, Mass.

While serving with MOB No. 5,
Captain Heintzelman declared,
“We have found that we treat
virtually every ailment we treated
back in -the -States. We function
primarily as any recognized hos-
pital in the United States. Most
of us are .sticking close to our
specialties, and have been sur-
prised at the number of medical,
«as contrasted with surgical, cases
we have received.”

Captain Heintzelman, who was
graduated from the School of
Medicine in 1927, was elevated to
the rank of captain in February,
1944, ranking from June 1, 1943.

Lt. Col. James F. Carroll, U. S.
Army, is at present in charge of
a battalion -of anti-aircraft some-
where in France. As the. result
of an action which took place on
August 2.2, 1944, he was awarded
the Bronze Star medal for meri-
torious conduct in performance of
outstanding service.

In spite of the fact that Lt. Col.
Carroll was -the ﬁrst battalion
commander in the European

Lt. Bruce Reuter

theater to receive this award, he
got his greatest thrill when he
met his ‘brother, Cpl. Paul A. Car-
roll, in September. They -had not
seen each other for three years,
so when Lt. Col. Carroll heard
that his brother’s outﬁt was sta-
tioned fairly close to his», he ar-
ranged «to go to see him. He writes
about the meeting, “I asked Paul's
commanding ofﬁcer -to send for
him without telling him what he
was wanted for. When Paul

‘Walked into the command -tent, I

was too excited to speak. Paul
just stood and looked for a mo-
ment, and then casually said, ‘Hi,
Jim’.”

Later in the month, Lt. Col. H.
Carroll arranged to have his
brother spend a week with him
so they «could get caught up on all
that had happened since they last
met in Pittsburgh.

Lt. Col. "Carroll, who was grad-
uated from the .'School of Engi-
neering in 1930., entered the serv-
ice in December, 1940.

Pitt War Loan Drive

Exceeding Quota

Boosting its goal to $24,825,
three times the original quota,
Pitt’s ‘Student War Loan drive
swings into its ﬁnal week and a
half today, already exceeding its
ﬁrst mark by almost $10,000. “Stu-
dents co-operated excellently,”
said Jackie Goodman, ‘El, chair-
man of the Pitt War Finance com-
mittee,” and we hope they re-
member o-ur slogan, ‘Stop rolling
in clover, the was isn’t over’.”

Phi Sigma Sigma leads the or-
ganization race, piling up $11,-
606.25. Running second is Alpha
Epsilon Phi, with $3,280, while
Phi Mu is third with $1,651.55.

The drive, which began on No-
vember 20, will end on December
15, the day Christmas vacation
begins.

Total Enrolled
In Schools

Increases

Total enrollment in the School
of Applied Social Sciences has in-
creased 23 per cent over the total
number of students at this time
last year, and enrollment of full
time students is stepped up 20 per

cent, according to Dr. W. I. News-
tetter, dean of the school.

Total number of enrollees is
170, including 89 full-time degree
program students, 8 part-time de-
gree program students, 23 ad-
vanced degree students, and 50
staff workers. SASS students rep-
resent 23 different states in the
United States, Puerto Rico, Brazil,
and Canada and are alumni of ap-
proximately 60 different colleges
from which they received their
bachelor degrees.

Dr. Franklin, dean of the School
of Education, reports that because
of the shortage of teachers, the
State Department of Public In-
struction is granting emergency
certiﬁcates to people who do not
meet all the requirements and at
the same time are not glutting the
market with inadequately trained
teachers. The School of Education
is now 99 per cent girls.

Four or ﬁve veterans have re-
turned to the School of Education
to resume their studies. '

At the present time, there is a
demand for mathematics, science,
and physical education teachers.
About twenty freshmen men are
majoring in physical education
this year, although only four men
from that department will be
graduated. .

The salaries of beginning teach-
ers have been increased and now
range between $1500 and $2000.
School authorities believe that this
status-will be permanent.

Because of the lack of men, the
Kappa Phi Kappa men’s physical
education honorary fraternity has
been suspended. The organization
is marking time until boys in the
service return. ‘

This year Pitt had the ﬁrst sub-
stantial return to normal evening
registration since Pearl Harbor.
An increase of 54 per cent enrolled
some 950 new students in evening
classes. Fifty-four of these were
discharged veterans.

Club’ Seeks Old Clothes!

Le Cercle Fraincais under the
direction -of Miss Blossom Henry
is collecting clothes for the French
war refugees -this week on the
ground ﬂoor. The French club
asks University students to con-
tribute any clothes that they may
not need. They prefer that the
garments -be clean, but thisiis not
a requirement. To publicize the
campaign, -girls are wearing na-
tive costumes of the different
provinces of France through the
halls.

ISALY'S MAIRY SPECIALISTS

To all you soldiers who are still
griping about the draft board call-
ing you in the middle of a semes-
ter, just sit back and cool off.
Here’s something to ease the sting!
The draft board plays no favorites,
because many of your old “profs”
are sweating out this war along
with you.

Do you remember any of these?

Major Samuel Williams, AAF,
formerly of the department of biol-
ogy, is in Australia where he was
sent for X-ray and treatment of
injuries resulting from a crash.
Major Williams, who has ﬂown
over 20,000 miles in the southwest
Paciﬁc, has served on many com-
bat missions as waist-gunner,
cameraman, and observer, and has
received the combat star and cita-
tion.

He writes, “I saw a lot of Pitt
men——everywhere, and Pitt can be
proud of its men. They have seen
every phase of a tropical cam-
paign, and I enjoyed living with
them—eating bully beef, washing
clothes in our helmets, and work-
ing and sleeping in the mud.”

FLYING PROJECTILES

WHEN Army ballistics experts needed to photograph
speeding rockets, scientists at Bell ‘Telephone Labora-
tories built the special "ribbon-frame” camera. Their

experience came from making high speed cameras to

study tiny movements in telephone equipment parts. ~

The new camera gets its name from the narrow slot
that exposes a ribbon of ﬁlm at a speed of one ten-

thousandth of a second. These "stills,’

taken on

wing rocket.

This is an example of the many ways Bell System i

research is helping to provide better weapons, better
equipment for war and peacetime telephone service.

In Casablanca!

Michael Fela-ck, C, former ser-
geant technician in the coast artil-
lery anti-aircraft entered the Uni-
versity this fall after more than
two years in the service. Station-
ed overseas for six months, he
participated in the battles of Casa-
blanca, Algeria, Tunisia, and
Kasarine.

“Mike” won’t say much about
his battle experiences. Instead, he
concentrates on revealing the so-
cial blunders he made with the
foreign damsels, one of which con-
cerned a lovely French blonde in
Casablanca. French interpreter for
the battery, he was asked by com-
panion soldiers to get acquainted
with the blonde, and he did his
best. “I called to her from across
a barbed wire fence one day,”
Mike said, “and told her, in my
high school French, what beautiful
hair she had. Two days later, I
was informed I had used the word

of Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower.

WAC Captain Keeps Supplies
Flowing to General Ike’s Men

Capt. Marion McKay Knowles, daughter of Dr. Marion McKay,
head of the economics department, has been overseas with the WACS
since April, 1944, and is now serving in Paris as ﬁrst aide to Com-
manding General John Clifford Hodges Lee, supply chief for the armies

Captain Knowles, who was with the ﬁrst contingent of WACS to
land in France,.ﬂew from London to Normandy just three weeks after

for “h-orse” instead of “hair.” Be-
lieve me, it did nothing to cement
our relationship. Fellows in the
artillery kept asking me whatever
happened to the blonde. He laugh-
ed. “Ya know, if I weren’t mar-
ried, I’-d go back and ﬁnd out.”

Mike’s word to the men who
‘soon will be coming back are: “I
hope the other veterans coming
back will avail themselves of the
GI Bill. It’s an opportunity that
will come ‘only once. I have no
doubt that most of them will take
advantage of it, however, for serv--
icemen have seen life at its lowest
ebb. They won’t want the same
life for themselves or their fami-
lies.”

let with a football on the front
and name on the back.

was once more exempliﬁed when

W. Whiteman met his brother,
Cpl. Jack Whiteman on‘ a small
island in New Guinea.
Lt. Whiteman, now serving in
the ..Ferry Service Command, is
remembered as the business mana-
ger of the 1940 Owl, the circulat-
ing manager of the 1939 Owl, a
member of ODK, of the Hall of
Fame, and of Pi Lambda Phi, so-
cial fraternity. He is now a pilot
of the air corps’ largest transport
plane carrying supplies and
evacuating wounled soldiers from
the battle ﬁelds to army hospitals.
While stationed in Australia, he
ﬂew to the shore of a small island
in the New Guinea area where his
brother, Cpl. Whiteman was sta-
tioned. With the commanding of-
ﬁcer’s permission, Cpl. Whiteman
drove a jeep across the island
where the plane had lanled, and
the brothers were reunited for a
short time.

peninsula. She said in letters to
her family that they lived in tents

in the woods for days and Worked
by lantern light. Once they had
reached Paris through the heavy
rains and deep mud, they were
assigned unheated. quarters be-
cause there is almost no fuel avail-
able in France. “Everyone is
cold,’’ she wrote, “but we all work
long hours, seven days a week, to
keep the supplies ﬂowing to Gen-
eral Eisenhower’s armies.”

Captain Knowles has had a va-
riety of experiences.

Eisenhower’s headquarters. Dur-
ing her free time, she has gone to
Versailles to see the famed Hall of
“I was disappointed be-
cause the mirrors looked so
dingy,” she said; “I’m used to good
Pittsburgh plate glass.”

While Captain Knowles was still
in England she had opportunities
to talk to both English and Scottish
children.
children she wrote, “They sat on
the edge of their seats to hear
everything I told them about
America. One thing they all
wanted to know, ‘What is the
difference bdtween a Democrat
and a Republican?’’’

With some shy Scottish children
she broke the idea by asking: "‘Is
there anyone here named M-cKay?”

A little red—haired Scotsman
stepped up and said, “Aye, Mc-
Kay.” He spelled it McKaye.‘

Question;

College Answers

What will college be like when
we get back? What new courses
will have been added while we
have been away, and ‘what new
ones will be added when we re-
turn to coll-ege‘? Will our training
while in service be given any
credit toward a degree? These
questions which it was felt, men
in service might be asking now,
Dr. Stanton C. Crawford, dean of
the College, has undertaken to
answer.

College Adds New Courses

Question: Will Pitt use the new,
intensiﬁed army methods for
teaching languages?

Answer: Yes, the modern lan-
guage department is adopting new
method language courses used on
this campus for army groups, for
all introductory language courses

for civilians. Also, increased atten-
tion is being given to the relation
of courses in history, geography,
political science, -sociology, liter-
ature, and ﬁne arts to language
courses of the nations and {regions
concerned.

Question: Does Pitt offer any
courses that will help train men
in government?

Answer: The College offers sev-
eral courses in govern-mental serv-
ice, in connection with which has
been developed the new Institute
of Local Government. The Insti-
tute deals with research and train-
ing in municipal administration
for the counties and municipali-
ties of Western Pennsylvania.

Question: We’ll be back at work
in post-war jobs when the war’s
over. Where are we going to ﬁnd
time to go to day classes?

Answer: Al-most all of the
Schools of ‘the University are
offering new afternoon, evening,
and Saturday classes in subjects
of professional and vo-cational
interest, and in material of inter-
est from the standpoint of general
culture. More of these courses are
being planned to meet post-war
needs.

Question: Science and technol-
ogy have become increasingly
important in this war, and
undoubtedly will continue to do
so after theiwar. Has Pitt added
any new courses in this ﬁeld?

Answer: The science depart-
ments are offering new courses in
laboratory technique, especially in
hospital technique courses because
of need for such work felt by
government agencies.

Question: Will we have to wait
until the opening of the next reg-
ular semester to begin college
work -after we are demobilized?

Answer: No, if there is suffi-
cient demand, intensive courses
will be organized from month to
month within a semester.

Veterans Ask About Credits

Question: Will the University
give credits for training» taken
while in service?

Answer: The University will
allo.w approximately half a
semester of work for basic army
or navy training, or its equivalent.

Marine Pilot Completes
80 Flights Against Nips

Marine First Lt. Randolph Kirk,
’23, is a ﬁghter pilot nowi uying
with the “Hell-Lions" squadron in
the South Pacific. Lt. Kirk t,51radu-
ated from Brentwood high school
in Pittsburgh in 1938_ and attend-
ed the University of Pittsburgh for

two years. He became an aviation

cadet in July 1942, and won his
wings at Corpus Christi, Texas, in
July 19-43. Since he went o‘y.erseas
:n December 1943, the lieutenant
has been on eighty missions.

In addition, ‘further credit is
granted for advanced training
courses. Every student while in
service may take correspondence
courses with the Armed Forces
Institute, which count towards
graduation. Students of V-.12, air
corps, and other classiﬁcations
where the work is done on -college
campuses may have transcripts
sent direct from those colleges to
the Registrar of the University.

Question: Will a high “_SCh00l.
diploma be required for entrance
to the University from veterans
who had to leave high school to
enter the service?

Answer:
accept scores of tests givjsn by
the United States Armed {Forces
Institute, or other tests of equiv?
lent rank to supplement recor -s
of high school work in casesswhere
students have not had the oppor-
tunity of graduating from high
school before entering the serv-
ices.

Semesters Go Back To Normal

Question: Will the University
continue its -accelerated program
after the war? 1“

Answer: No, the University has
returned to a normal -schedule of
semesters. An expanded summc.
session will still be’ available,
however, so that those veterans
who wish to accelerate the ‘pro-
gress of their work may do so.

Question: Will any sort of
degree he offered for those vet-
erans who cannot complete’? more
than two years of college work?

Answer: The College ‘has
arranged to award a new degree,
associate in arts, to veterans who
successfully complete two: years
of college work. For those who
can continue, the credits counted
towards this degree may also be
counted towards the regular bach-
elor’s degree.

Congratulations to Major and

’ _M1“s. Joseph Francis Dunn on the

V

birth of their son, Joseph Francis
Jr." The baby was born while Ma-
jofr Dunn was serving overseas.
From England the new father
 about “Merry old England
with its driving on the left side,
its heat fﬁelds, stone fences, and
oh yes, its rain.” He says, “Spent
my ﬁrst two weeks overseas in
France but was transferred to
England. I’ve been lucky in see-
ing -places——Paris, Glasgow, Cher-
bourg, and London. When, in Lon-
don ‘ I bumped into Joseph Mc-
Closky (Col. ’38) with whom I had
quite a chat. He was telling me
of his family—-two children now.”
I Lt. Jack Hoeveler who is sta-
tioned in Paris these days says
that he has been fortunate enough
to«_meet several Pitt men and that
he" has a hard time getting past
Paris’ famous sidewalk cafes. Ac-
cordingto Jack, “They have liquid
booby traps.”

Lt. Sherman Jubelirer goes on
about Paris too--“Wha.t a city
Paris is! Something like New
York, beautiful women in every
cafe and more plentiful than cog-
nac. ; I was there ﬁve days after
the-;Jerries turned tail, and the
people went wild over les Ameri-
cains.” Paris was off limits, but
Sherman happened to have some
business to attend to, namely route
reconnaissance, and conveniently
got lost. His comment “C’est la
gue'r're.” V’

From “Somewhere in China”
comes word from 1st Lt. Tom Barr
who is with a ﬁghter squadron in
the 14th Air Force, “General
Chennault’s little baby.” Tom

-V writes “I am looking forward to

the day that I can see the good
old Cathedral again.” Apparently
‘he has been informed of all the
changes at school because he in-
sists that when he gets back he’ll
ﬁnd Mr. Biddle’s oﬁice somehow—
“even if it takes a guide.”

We hear that Lt. Bob Sullivan is
one of the few Pitt men in Hol-

~ land.

Former cadet colonel of the
ROTC, Jim Dimel is now a lieu-
tenant recently gone overseas.
Jim says “I’ve been in England
almost two months now—just a
rookie; but I’m learning. We had
a good -time ﬂying over here in
our own plane. I’m a B-17 pilot,
and to date I’ve had ﬁve combat
missions.” The former Charlotte
Harris is Mrs. Dimel, and their
son, who was a year old on Octo-
ber 2, is now beginning to walk.
Now in England too is S/ Sgt. Wil-
liam Klinkenstein. —

Capt. Tom Westermann, ', ’42
graduate, is stationed in Italy.
Everybody talks about “sunny
Italy,” and Tom says, “we’ve had
a week of ﬁne weather, but again
our rains are with us—it’s funny
how you become accustomed to it
and just sort of take it for granted.
We've got a wooden ﬂoor in our
tent. now so ‘we feel we're living
like; kings.” Tom is looking for-
ward to running into D. J. Bailey
who was in his ’42 graduating
class.

Dr. Jamison and her staff re-
ceived a Christmas card from Lt.
Elizabeth Devitt Anderson, former
women’s health service nurse for
the evening school, who is now
serving overseas in the army.

Pitt was glad to welcome back
even for a short visit Marine Lt.
Milt Snyderman who stopped to
say “Hi” while he was en route
from Quantico, Virginia, to his
present station on the West Coast.
Miltsays that everything looks dif-
ferent but the crowds in the Tuck
Shop. * _

Home on leave too, within the
past few weeks, have been Ensign
Evelyn Ferguson, former WSGA
president; the crowds were thick
around her with people who
wanted a word with “Fergie”;
Margie Beal of the Spars, who,
while at school, belonged to the
Heinz Chapel choir, was able to be
present at our Thanksgiving chapel
service; and Marine Lt. C. J. Don-
ohue.

Major Edward E. Rose, Dent ’38,
has ha-d a wide army experience
since he enlisted on Armistice
day, 1944.

After his training in oral sur-
gery at Walter Reed hospital, he
w as stationed .
at c amps in
United States
where he did
everything from
serving on
dental examin-
ing boards to
p e r f o r m —
ing minor med-
ical operations
and doing op-
erative dentis- 
try. ‘

At the completion of a course
at Carlisle Barracks, Pa., he was
assigned to an Auxiliary Surgical
Group where for six months he
trained recruits for the unit. Then
as Detachment Commander, he in-
structed his unit for overseas
duty.

In Tunisia, Major Rose and his
team treated casualties from Sicily
and Italy. After four months they
were shipped to Italy where they
are now doing oral surgery in a
General Hospital.

‘Major Rose feels that in the
service he has learned a lesson
he will never forget:

“The Army wants quality in
each operation that the dental
oﬁicer performs. Each soldier
treated deserves the best of pro-
fessional skill and idealism-for
he may -die some day in a fox hole
in order that we may go on liv-
ing and practicing the profession
that is a key to independence.”

While at Pitt, Major Rose was
active on campus as president of
Student Faculty association, pres-
ident of Druids, editor of Dental
Rays, and president of Pre-Den-
tal society. ,

From “over there,” Lt. Alvin
Gross writes, “Have now seen the
larger part of two major foreign
countries—-England and France.
Being a semi-mobile anti aircraft
unit, we are fortunate in being
able to stay in each spot for a short
while, giving us a chance to see
and learn that part of the coun-
try.” About Paris he says, “It’s
the most fascinating and beautiful
city that I’ve yet encountered.
Paris is still off limits to all troops
not stationed in the city, but I
have found excuses to enable sev-
en trips into it.” Alvin comments
about the robot bombs, “It’s a
great sensation to hear one coming
closer and closer, getting louder
and louder, then for the motor to
shut off and to await those eter-
nal seconds deciding your fate.
Really give the English people
credit for sweating those devils
out!”

Lt. John Ross, who recently re-
ceived his ﬁrst lieutenancy, is sta-
tioned on Guam with the Marine
Corps, doing some sort of recon-
struction work.

There are congratulations com-
ing to these former Pitt men: In
Italy, S/ Sgt. Jack H. Denning, nose
gunner on a B-24 Liberator Bomb-
er, has been awarded the Air
Medal. Also in Italy, Tech. Sgt.
John L. Harr was recently awarded
the first bronze Oak Leaf cluster
to the Air Medal for meritorious
achievement on aerial ﬂights
against the enemy. Somewhere in
France, Richard W. Raught has
been promoted to Corporal in the
Ninth Air Force Service Command
unit to which he is attached. At
an Eighth Air Force bomber sta-

 

tion in England Lt. Robert Foote
has been awarded the Air Medal
for “courage, coolness, and skill
displayed while on bombing at-
tacks over Germany.”

Col. Frederick D. Westervelt,
Medical School, 1930, surgeon of
the Tenth Army, has had wide ex-
perience in medical work since he
became a regular army doctor upon
his graduation from Pitt’s Medical
School. He ﬁrst worked in vari-
ous army camps throughout the
United States. At one time he
helped to train the Seventh Army
corps in desert warfare. This
outﬁt, with the United States Ma-
rines, later took Tarawa. After
serving with Admiral Nimitz in
the Paciﬁc for eight months, Col.

. Westervelt was made the surgeon

of the Tenth Army, now serving
somewhere in the Paciﬁc. During
the battle for Saipan he and his
men helped with the evacuation
of American casualties from the
island.

Lt. D. D. Wolfe USNR, a grad-
uate of the School of Education,
on duty in the European ﬁeld of
operations, recently had the -op-
portunity of spending an hour or
so at Mont Saint Michel and the
Isle of Capri. °,_

Lt. 0. B. Lewis is doing “Sier-
sonnel work within the technical
Command attached to the office
of chemical Warfare service. This
particular division works on re-
search, development, and testing
of kinds of gases, smokes, bombs,
and other munitions and equip-
ment.

Pfc. Elmer Match is teaching
the B24 electrical system at Kees-
ler Field, Mississippi.

Captain Mark J. Anderson of
the 13th Combat Wing is now sta-
tioned in England. A graduate of
the School of Education, he has
made numerous trips to Various
places over the third Reich. He
has received the Air Medal with
several clusters an-d the Distin-
guished Flying Cross as a result
of these missions. He writes that
he recently enjoyed.‘ a seven—day
leave visiting Scotland.

Lt. (j. g.) T. 0. Crawford in the
naval construction battalion in
the ‘South Paciﬁc wrote that in
Hilo near Hawaii, after spending
considerable time in remoter parts
of the island, he was kept busy
keeping supplies going to projects
located some distance from this
port.

1st Lt. Ruggero J. Aldisert
USMC recently spent a few days
at home while en route to the
Philadelphia Naval hospital where
he is now convalescing. Senior
awardee of the class of 1941, Lt.
Aldisert spent 20 months . in the
South and Central Paciﬁc.

Roosevelt Richardson, Ed ’42,
has been promoted to captain in
the Army Air Corps and is now in
Italy. .

Harold Paul Tardy, Jr., BA ’46,
has been promoted to photogra-
pher’s mate, 3/ic, in the United
States Navy. Petty Oﬁicer Tardy
is now stationed at Atlantic City
Naval Air Base.

A graduate of the class of ’39,
Phys Ed, Pvt. Harold J. Ben-
ner, writes from Wakeman Gen-
eral hospital, Camp Atterbury,
Ind., that he is serving there as a
physical reconditioning instructor.
“It’s my job to get sick and
wounded patients back into good
physical shape to be returned to
duty or discharged,” he says. ,,

Cpl. Ray 0. McGahey a Bus Ad
’43 graduate is reported somewhere
in France.

Jim Rees is in midshipman
school at Cornell university. Cpl.
Daniel Mears is in New Guinea.

Lt. Martin Gurrentz has com-
pleted ﬁfty-four missions over
Germany and has received the
DFC and Presidential citation for
meritorious service.

Camping somewhere in Belgium
is Cpl. Ted Mallinger. S 2/c Milt
Salamon is stationed in Chicago.

A letter from Major Rip Riva’
tells of doings in the C-B-1 area.
His “revamped unit is still sup-
porting Chinese troops in pursuit
of the very clever J ap.” The Chi-
nese soldier “is a good but under-
nourished fellow who has a good
sense of humor and an inquisitive
nature . . . The Eagwan (phonet-
ically speaking) is the counterpart
of the American medical ofﬁcer
but his medical education is lim-
ited to a course, if he’s lucky, of
instruction of a few weeks dura-
tion. It is startling to see some
of the primitive measures taken
by some of these people, such as
application of leaves or ground to-
bacco on wounds, traumatization
of ﬂesh or burning of the skin to
cure chills and fever.

HQ., TENTH AIR FOR-CE IN
INDIA—Promotion to major of
Andrew L. Cox, 26, son of Mr.
and Mrs. Ralph W. E. Cox, R. D.
8, Box 697, Pittsburgh, Pa., has
been announced by Maj. Gen.
Howard C .
Davidson, Com-
manding ‘Gen-
eral, Tenth Air
Force, EAC.

Attached t-o
an anti-aircraft
squadron of the
Tenth Air
Force that op-
erates against
the Japanese in
the India—Bur-
ma theater, Maj. Cox has been
in the army ﬁve and one half
years and has spent the past year
in this theater. ‘

The newly-promoted ofﬁcer,
who also holds the Air Medal, was
graduated from Perry High
school, Pittsburgh, and the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, class of 1939.

Lt. Perry F. Bowser, ’4l, was
ﬁrst reported missing, in De-
cember 1942, and a year later was
placed on the list of the missing.
In the local newspapers of his
home town area stories were car-
ried which indicated that one of
his buddies had seen his plane hit
by ﬂak and crash-land near a Ger-
man air ﬁeld in North Africa.
Perry was seen moving about the
plane after it landed, but he has
never been listed as a prisoner of
war. After the Allies conquered
North Africa, the search for him
proved unsuccessful.

George F. Young, ’43, was listed
as a prisoner of war last year after
he failed to return from a bombing
mission. He served as a navigator
on a Flying Fortress.

4 Athletes In Service

Every day, letters pour in from
Pitt students now in the service.
Dr. Carlson seems to be an excel-
lent correspondent, for he gets a
heap of letters from his boys of
past basketball seasons. Some of

the boys may have moved on since
their last letters, but ' let’s look
around and see where just a few
of many ex-Pitt athletics were, at
one time or another.

S/ Sgt. Bill Sopak checked in
from France via V-mail. CPL P3111
F. Lohmeyer, writing from New
Guinea, has been in plenty of lo-
calities. Paul is attempting to keep
himself in basketball trim by
playing with a service tea-m. Lt.
Eddie Strall has probably moved
out of North Carolina from where
he had been writing. Eddie is now
a proud papa of “a future Pitt
player.” Strall relates to the Doc
that the kid practices yelling
everyday, getting ready “for some
of th-ose nasty Pittsburgh officials.”

“Rags” Radvansky was sailing
the Paciﬁc when a Carlson letter
caught up with him. Hawaii was
entertaining Lt. (jg.) Ralph L.
Josephs. With the Marines in the
Paciﬁc is Lt. Georgie Kocheran.
Bill Cieply was: at Camp Croft,
South Carolina. Bill reports that a
modiﬁed form of -Carlson’s Fatigue
Curve system is used to condition
the soldiers.

Two husky marines that are
back from acti-on in the Paciﬁc
are Col. Paul Zeyfuss and Capt.
Mel Port. Colonel Zeyfuss, ex-
Carlson aide, is now at Camp Le-

jeune while Captain Port is out
on the coast. Red Scott is also
back from those same remote
regions. These marines are cov-
ered with various decorations
which were earned in some of the
toughest ﬁghting of the war.
J. Robert Artman is an air cadet
at the "United States Naval Air
Station at Corpus Christi, Texas.
Normie Frey is also in the ﬂying
game and was at Harlington, Tex-
as when he last»-wrote the doc that
he and a group of Pennsylvanians
soundly trounced a bunch of
Brooklyn boys in a basketball
encounter. Another cager who is.
anxious to get back to the basket-
ball wars is Ed Latagliata, some-
where in France. Ed hopes to be
out by next year and “be back
dashing up and down the hard-
wood.” Ed writes, “I still have
determination to play in the
NCAA ﬁnals in the Gardens one
of these years in the future.”

Marine Capt. Edward J. Hirsh-
berg, former Yale university foot-
ball line coach, has reported to the
Marine Corps Air Depot, Miramar,
Calif., from the Central Paciﬁc. He
served at Roi-Namur in the Mar-
shalls for 15 months as a, com-
munications ofﬁcer with a Marine
ﬁghter squadron. Prior to joining
the Yale coaching staff, the former
University of Pittsburgh end was
assistant coach at ‘Dartmouth col-
lege and West Virginia univer-
sity.

Many more boys have been
heard from. They all have the
same wish which is to be home as
soon as possible. Many hope to
resume their schooling; some have
hopes of staying in aviation or
some other special branch of the
service. But, regardless of what
plans each has, all the boys are
certain that sports will play an
important role in the postwar
world. .

Hagan

Encouraging

Director of Athletics James
Hagan has this encouraging mes-
sage for, Pitt servicemen:

“We are determined to keep
going in athletics in so far as it
is possible during the war emer-
gency. We feel that athletics are
important enough to continue-—
even though the box scores may
not sometimes be the way we
think w-e would like to see them.
To quit would be the easy way
out—-to continue is the tough way
but the better way in the long
run. We shall have the satisfac-
tion of keeping interest in inter-
collegiate athletics alive, and we
shall be in position for -a quick
recovery as soon as the war is
over———whic'h means that we shall
be in position early to repay our
opponents for some of the lickin-gs
we have taken——and you can be
certain that we are going to win

F A recently released basketball
schedule reveals that the season
is officially here on December 15
when the Pitt cagers travel to
Meadville to play Allegheny..This
contest will open a comparatively
brief court slate which consists
in entirety of 12 games. Home-
and-home battles are slated with
Geneva, Carnegie Tech, West-
minster. “snn State and West Vir-
ginia. ' ngle contests, both on the
road Nil]. ﬁnd Allegheny and the
Army Cadets as the opposition.

It is too early to evaluate any
of the teams on,the schedule. The
Carnegie Tech Tartans are the
only quintet to get into action
thus far, having gained a 27-25
victory over Slippery Rock State
Teachers. However, all of the pro-
spective opponents have ﬁne bas-
ketball reputations.

The 12 games slated for this
season are -two less than‘ last
year’s schedule when the “Tiny
‘Toughies” copped only ﬁve while
losing nine. Bethany, Ohio State,
and New York University have
been dropped. Allegheny will be
the new team to play Pitt.

This year’s team, -called the
“Phantoms,” looks so -promising
that Dr. Harold Clifford Carlson,
veteran Pitt cage mentor, can
hard-ly contain himself. The squad
is taller than -last year’s, with this
added height sure to make a
decided difference. The following
boys are most likely to see the
majority of the action: N.ate
Apple, a Navy dent student, who
wa-s a standout at the forward
post on the varsity last season;

often.”

Hopes For

“The best of good luck and an

former ‘basketball players, please
know that the new group comes
up to the standard of big hearts
and a desire to WIN ’EM ALL.
It’s the ‘biggest -team we have
had in four years. We are sure .
because most of the trousers aren’t I
big enough. We want to wini

make you proud of Pitt.”"

THE PITT NEWS

Page Eleven

By Moe Spiegel, Sports Editor

Well, football season has just ﬁnished and Pitt is getting ready
for basketball. The gridders didn't do too bad._ They beat West Vir-
ginia, Bethany, Chatham army air base, and Penn State. The win
over the Nittany Lions was really a humdinger, the score being 14-0.
This ended the season with a happy tone, although ﬁve of the top
elevehs in the nation administered sound trouncings to the Panthers.
This quintet of Goliaths was made up of Notre Dame, Army, Illinois,
Ohio State and Indiana. So, we copped four out of nine which was
okay -considering the opposition, don’t you think?

A Really screwy Bunch

Itis doubtful if the Pitt gridders had much fun when the opposi-
tion was piling it on. The fans also were having a hard time of it.
But present at each game were ﬁve jumping jacks who made fun for
themselves when the going was tough. I mean the cheerleaders, Larry
Burwinkle, Jim Ludwig, Sandy Lampl, Dick Seewald and Danny
Mallinger. With only Burwinkle having any of this type of experience,
and that in high school, the group learned their own motions for the
traditional yells. Steadily progressing, the boys hit their peak when
they went to Ohio State. They played football with the Buckeye
cheerleaders (and beat them), they went whooping it up all over the
vast Columbus stadium and the fans got as big a kick out of them as
they did out of the game itself. The contest with Penn State saw

these, boys together in action for the last time. Sandy Lampl leaves

for the service next week, while none of the others expect to be
around next year. Seewald, Mallinger, Ludwig and Burwinkle are in
the air corps and face call early in the spring.

IF Race Was A Hot One 4

The grid race in the Interfraternity Touch Football league was
a torrid affair which was not decided until the ﬁnal game. The Phi
Eps took the title in this ﬁnal tilt by downing the PiKAs, thus break-
ing adeadlock for ﬁrst place with the latter aggregation. The Delta
Tau Deltas came in third. All the frat teams showed plenty of power,
and the ‘basketball schedule being arranged should turn into a mighty
interesting slate. So, whether your frat be the Delts, Phi Delts, Phi
Eps, Phi Gams, PiKAs, Pi Lambs, SAEs, or Sigma Chis, you can bank
on a slam-bang battle.

Win ’em All _ ‘

g The above is still the slogan of Dr. Harold Clifford (Red) Carlson
and his basketball team. It looks like the cagemen may do just this.
They have only a 12-game schedule to contend with and with a little
luck, oh brother! Elsewhere on the sports page are some of the play-
ers who will carry the hopes of the Phantoms as they take the court.
Did I say Phantoms? Well, that is the name that Carlson has be-
stowed on his players. “They are here today and gone tomorrow,” he
says. “Just like Phantoms.”

All those who failed to have
their individual pictures taken for
the 1945 Owl before the Decem-
ber. 2 deadline, should have them
taken at Gimbels on Tuesday,
Jecember 12.

All‘proofs of pictures for the
1945 Owl must be returned to
Gimbel brothers by Monday, De-
-cember 11, without fail.

Freshman Club will meet
Thursday at 12:30 in the YMCA
oiﬁce on the eighth ﬂoor. Dr. H.
C. Carlson, director of the men's
heal-th service, will speak on the
topic “Basketball at Pitt.” An
interesting meeting is being plan-
ned, and all freshmen are urged
to attend.

Coach Carlson has some pretty slick strategy up his sleeve from the pleased locks on the faces of 
key players. They are (in the usual order): Front row; Oland Canterna, Harry, (Hank) Zcllers, Clair

(Tay) Malarkey.

Back row; Frank Morris, Philip Marder, and Nate Apple.

Now a, climax, ﬁtting and proper,
is to pick the players to land,

The men who have been most out-
standing , . . The all-Ameri-

While the system that’s used may
vary, according to ways that

There are always some loud sec-

Then, if it was left up to coeds,
whose judgment is -wise and
astute,

They’d answer with dreamy-eyed
rapture, “I want him
Oh isn’t he cute!”

Finally there are the

twisters, the boys

this method is too nerve-
wracking, and now it’s con-
sidered all wrong.

it’s done over a bottle of
booze!

Last week June Thomson ap-
approached me, “N ext week is
the servicemen’s issue,

Please, for a change, write some
good stuﬁ‘, or the Pitt News
will have to miss you.”

I answered, “June (sigh) I'll do
my best . . and give them
a. team of teams!

And also, for something quite dif-
ferent, I’ll spotlight the team
of my dream!!!”

“Pitt hasn’t changed much,” said Ensign Evelyn Ferguson, former
president of Women’s Self-Government association, when she visited
the campus in November on leave before taking up a new assignment

at the navy yard in Philadelphia.

Ensign Ferguson enlisted in the WAVES upon graduation last
June. She went to Smith college, Northampton, Massachusetts for
her indoctrination, and after eight weeks of strict regimentation re-

ceived her commission.

She was then sent to Corpus Christi, Texas.

Her work there was secret fol¢

some time, but recently she has
been permitted to reveal that her
job concerned electronics. Ensign
Ferguson found the math and phy-
sics she had taken at Pitt of great
value in her training for that work.

She was enthusiastic in her
praise of navy life. She said that
it taught responsibility, and that
except for the ﬁrst strenuous
weeks a WAVE has a good deal of
time to herself. Ensign Ferguson
agrees heartily with the WAVE
slogan, “Every WAVE a re-
cruiter.”

There are other former Pitt
serving in the WACS,
WAVES, Marines, SPARS,
WASPS, and army and navy
nurses. They rank from private
to major, and from seaman to
lieutenant (jg). The highest
ranking oﬂicer is Maj. Mary Louise
Milligan of the WACS.

Overseas duty seems to be a
specialty for Pitt women. Lt.
Sarah Jane Thompson served two
and one-half years as an army
nurse in the China-Burma-India
area. She is now assigned to the
Crile General hospital in Cleve-
land, Ohio.

If ribbons were given for ‘ﬁrsts’
in the service many a Pitt woman
would be wearing one.

Lt. Helen Wick was in the ﬁrst
class commissioning oﬁicers in the
Marine Corps Women’s reserve.
She is now in charge of women’s
personnel at the Fleet Marine Base
in Norfolk, Va.

Captain Sylvia Marsili was with

the ﬁrst WAC contingent to go
abroad. She had an administra-
tive post with the headquarters
service of supply in North Africa.
That was in June. In September
she moved with our troops into
Italy, and she is now reported to
be in, or near, Marseilles, France.
While in Italy, Capt. Marsili had
an audience with the Pope. In a
card to her home in Pittsburgh,
she said, “When I ﬁrst entered the
Vatican, I was frightened, but the
quiet and peaceful voice of the
Pope soon calmed me. It was an
event I shall certainly never for-
get.”

Another ﬁrst: Frances Eliza
Wills, a ’43 June graduate of the
School of Applied Social Sci-
ences was the ﬁrst colored woman
to be accepted by the WAVES.

Ruth Swanson, E’44, who
worked in the Alumnae ofﬁce dur-
ing the summer, left October 20
for indoctrination into the WAVES
at Hunter college. Upon comple-
tion of her training she will be
placed in either administration or
communications work.

At Pitt Miss Swanson was a
Delta Delta Delta, a Cwen, on the
social committee of WSGA, and a
member of Pi Lambda Theta and
Delta Delta Lambda.

Her father, Dr. William Swan-
son, an instructor in the Dental
School, was also a graduate of
Pitt.
