' Members of the CGS Student
Cabinet Council (evening student
government) voted in a special
meeting, Thursday, October 9,
1980,’ to accept’ office space in
Schenley Hall, tentatively scheduled
for renovation next summer.

The evening student government
‘offices, presently located on the
fourth floor of the Cathedral, ‘will
be relocated to the sixth floor of
‘Schenley Hall during the winter

A term of 1982.

- “The decision to move was based
upon the increase in the amount of
space that will be available to us,”
said Tom Hajduk, president. of the
evening student government.
Hajduk also said he felt the
Cathedral offices had enabled the
government to serve evening
students quite well. However, with

.. more space in the new location,

those services would be improved.
The new offices will provide a

_ reception room, storage facilities

to Hajduk, ’

In addition, there will be more

,“lnitially, the flow of students

down when we relocate. -However,

the additional space at that time. It
was not until the middle of
September, 1980, that the evening
government ‘expressed an interest in
being included, Hajduk said.

Thedecision to move the evening
government was based on a realistic

dent activities and they also will be
able to serve their constituency
more effectively,” Smith added. '
By having their offices in
Schenley Hall, it will be easier for
the evening‘ government to become

a part of the main» stream, Smith’

said. In addition, it will enhance
their perception on campus" as a
full-bodied student government. ac-

cording to Smith."

’ ‘-‘I look forward to them being
here,” said Smith. ‘‘It is clearly ap-,

government well.’ ’

Along with the evening student
government will be housed the of-

ciety To Fund Pitt

By ANGELA RYLANDER

Institutional grants used as “seed
money” for the initiation of new
projects in cancer research were
awarded to seven Pitt students and
faculty members by the American
Cancer Society.

The announcement of the reci-
pients was made Sept. 24 by Dr.
Peter Ove, chairman of Pitt’s
American Cancer Society Institu-
tional Research Grant Committee.

The recipients included Dr.
Patricia Jargiello, research assistant
professor in the School of
Medicine; Katherine Klein, a
graduate student in the School of
Medicine; Dr. James Pipas, an

assistant professor in the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences; Dr. Peter
Polverini, assistant professor in the
School of Dental Medicine; Dr.
K.N. Rao, a research assistant pro-
fessor in the School of Medicine;
Dr. Earnest Sternglass, a professor
in the School of Medicine; and
David Truitte, a graduate student in
the School of Medicine.

According to Ove, awards are
given out twice a year to those ap-
plicants with the highest “scientific
merit” and proposals related to
cancer research.

The research will cover a wide
range of cancer related studies,
from the isolation of chromosomes

u

to the detection of early breast
cancer.

“A ‘maximum of $3,000 per-
year,” can be awarded to each reci-
pient, Ove said.

The $3,000 in laboratory research
isn’t very much money, according
to Ove when considering the high
cost of chemicals, lab animals, in-
struments and other costs.

However, the purpose of the
grant is to provide “seed money”
for new projects and hopefully
award" winners will have a stronger
backing and better chance when ap-
plying for bigger grants to continue
their studies, _Ove said.

Individuals interested in receiving

a grant are required to write a two-
page proposal about their research
project.

Applications are then reviewed
by eight committee members from
different schools and scientific
backgrounds.

According to Ove, individuals
with the “highest priority get fund-
ed.” Priority points range from
1-5. One being the highest and five
the lowest.

Jargiello and her assistant Jane
Vergnes (P.I-I.D. candidate at Pitt)
will be working on the isolation of
chromosomes (rod-shaped bodies
found in the nuclei of cells) from
human cells.

“If we can isolate chromosomes
from normal cells we can form

cancerous cells,” Jargiello said.

Jargiello believes the $2,000
awarded to her may lead to further
grants“from the National Institution
of Health.

According to Ove it is difficult to
maintain research funds. Each year
a new application requesting fun-
ding and a progress report is sent to
the American Cancer Society. If
progress is slow the “funds will dry
out,” Ove said.

Progress is measured by the
number of publications written and
the ability of the -recipients to
receive other and larger grants.

The American Cancer Society
doesn’t receive state or federal fun-
ding, but generates money through
fund drives and contributions.

—_~25t_h' will be the final of the
-festivities, a concert at Carnegie

will be held in the student union
lower lounge. ‘

’ The concert to be held‘ Oct. 25,
8:00 at.Carnegie Music Hall will
be the climax of the seminar. All

of the musicians will come together 5

on the stage.

Nathan Davis, a music instructor
at Pitt and initiator of the seminars
said, ‘.~‘It (the concert) will be more
structured than a jam. Each musi-
cian has been asked to bring two
Two hours

 

      

before the show we will get together
and put the show together.” Davis
added thatthe rehearsal is not open
to the public.

A Many of the musicians participa-

' ting in this year’s‘ jazz seminar have

played together in the past. Stanley
Turrentine, a Pittsburgh native, put
out an album in 1973 called “Don’t
Mess With Mr.‘ T,” The credits on
the inside of the album reveal Idris
Mohammad as drummer and Ron
Carter as bassist. -

Carter recently released an album
titled “Pickin”’ which features
Kenny Barron on piano.‘

5 Davis said his familiarity with the
musicians was a factor in getting the
musicians to become involved in the
seminars. ’

“I’_ve played with all but one of
these musicians individually. ‘They
come here out of friendship...we
get,together and we enjoy, doing it,”
he said. -

Although Davis claims that get-.
ting musicians has never" been a pro- '
'blem, there was a time when the

concert was not successful, Davis
told the Pittsburgh Press, “Donald

‘Byrd and Max «Roach took part in
the first concert _and I_was really -'

disappointed because only about
700 people showed up. But Max en-
couraged ‘me and told me to stick
_with it.” ‘ ‘ ‘
Since its conception 10"years ago,
the success of the seminar has con-

~ tinued to grow. Davis said he ex-

pects this year’s show to be better
than last year’s, which sold out at
the Carnegie Music Hall.

October 29-31.
The seminar, sponsored by St.

and advanced grant writing techni-

quirements, according to Dr. Bill
Hunter, a consultant for the in-
stitute. A . ‘
“Every year the federal govern-
ment gives away over $80 billion in
grants,” Hunter said, “but the
competition for those funds is in-
creasingly intense, and grant-writing
is becoming harder work all the

. time. The key is to develop a pro-

gram consistent ' with agency
priorities,” he added.

Federal and private funds are '

available for an "amazing variety

.of purposes,” Hunter said, adding

that "government officials, as well as

social service organizations, and

law enforcement agencies could.

‘benefit from such a program.

He added that art councils,
educators, hospital administrators,
recreation directors, researchers,
and many other professionals
would be better off if they knew the
realities of the funding game.

Dr. Karl Borden, president of the
institute; says that the NGDI is “the
second largest grant training
organization in the country. Every
year we conduct seminars from
Boston to Honolulu.

“The ‘grantsmanship seminar’, is

a major product of our institute,”

according to Borden. “It's an in-

tensive, three-day train-ing program.
and includes the full gamut o_f those
seeking government and private
grants.” \

The seminar, to be held at the
Harley Hotel on Rodi Road, is one
of 40 to be presented" nationally by
the institute. . A

The structure of the program,
which runs 21 hours, is broken into
three basic areas: . government
sources, 14 hours; private sources,
five hours; and budget, two hours,
according to Bofden. A

The actual outline of the program

is divided into ten categories:

“money, money,..who’s got the‘

money;” “the pot of gold syn-
drome;” “goalxsetting;”_ “writing
the narrative;” and “demonstrating
need.” A A

Carter and Ronald Reagan agreed ‘

Tuesday to face each other Oct. 28
in a 90-minute debatein Cleveland,
a week before the election.

They _will be. questioned by a A

moderator anil four panelists to be
chosen by the League of Women
Voters, which is sponsoring the 9:30
p.m. EST debate. . A -

-The agreement about the format,
date.- and site of the debate was
reached by nego_tiators— for Carter

and Reagan after‘ more than six.

hours of talks duringtwo days in

/

Also included are: proposal

variations, format and design,
private funding sources, budget,
and project management. A

\

“We try to build the capacities of
the attendees” of the program,
Hunter said. *“We teach them how
to find out who has the money and
how to go about getting it.”

' Hunter stressed the point that the
program be consistent with agencies
priorities. . , A ’

A “Some organizations go after the
money just because it’s there. The
organization must know what it_
wants "to do. Grants must fit into.
the organization, not control it.”

\

Bill Hennessey, assistant ex-
ecutive director of Mercy Hospital,
a fund-seeking organization, agreesA
with Hunter’s statement. A

“We had ‘ a lot of areas ‘of

said Robert S. Strauss, chaifman of
the Carter-Mondale’ committee.
“We each gave up some things.” A

Asked about that, James Baker,
the ~-chief Reagan negotiator, said
“a little bit of this, a little bit of
that.” _ ’ A ~

Strauss had said earlierthat _there

were “a few hangups” about the -

“A lot of agencies‘l’ve seen turn
out any proposals, hoping to get
some money. I think you have to
pick and choose,” Hennessey said.

“l’ve been successful because my
proposals met their (the sources) re-

proach. You pinpoint needs and
then plan your proposal based on
those needs,” he added;

‘ Pitt’s plans to take. part in the Semester at Sea ‘pro-
gram seem to have sprung a leak. . 1
“The program, which this. past spring drew hearty

applause from Chancellor Wesley Posvar and
members of the University Senate Cou-ntil, was voted

down last week by the college of Arts and Sciences

I Council. I

The Semester at Sea Program would give 100 Pitt

A students the opportunity to study for one semester

aboard the S.S. Universe, spending approximately 50

days at various portsaround theworld and 50 days

One of the port stops I would be
Capetown’, South Africa. , \ . -

Professor Neal Galpern alluded. to the South

‘’ A African segregationnof whites on the Cape peninsula

as one situation‘ the University should consider con-
cerning the program. ’
“The SS. Universe will be sailing to Capetown,

if ' South Africa,” Galpernsaid. “Is--it not morally in-

appropriate to send the ship to the Union of South.
Africa?” » \ I E
One black studies professor slated to sail on’ the
journey has refused because of the South‘African
situation. ’ E * E
Another line of questioning arose from uncertain-

ties as to who retains theright “to shape the pro-» .
grams’ educational merits and the issue of academic

control.” ' ~ g
“At the moment, the SAS program consists of

 - Fabout seven-eighths liberal arts and about one—eighth

I

business course programs,” Galpern said. ~

Dean‘Irwin Schulman cited the program was one
designed only for the wealthy.

“Few students can afford the “$6,500,” said
Schulman. ' - A ' ~

Schulman also blasted the program as being a poor

r replica of actual study abroad. .

“It will be a floating American environment that
only partially duplicated study/iabroad,” Schulman
_said._ , ._ '

Ln Maywhen the program was unyeiled before the
Senate Council, The Pitt ~~ News supported the

»-Seaboard program as a much needed addition to
Pitt’s undergraduate curriculum. "Until _concrete
facts are provided to persuade us otherwise, we will
maintain our positive view of the program. '

We are grateful that the CAS council-has decided.
to take a critical look at the Semester At Sea pro-
gram. ' E‘ U ’ ,

But, ‘it seems that the council is just a bit late in
passing its judgment on the program tha-t‘hasi been
under discussion since last school year.

Where were all of these concerned" ;council
members last year when Chancellor. Posvar’ first
introduced the program to the University Senate
Council? . — '

» As we said, we do appreciate the concern on the

A .. part of the council, but where were they when their

concern could have really donesome good?

In other words, Pitt is legally bound to participate
in the program for the next two years. I ‘ I

dumb enough to honestly ‘believe
that the public would believe that he

wasn’t really taking the money for

himself.

Ayatollah A Khomeini—for being

Pitt News Sports Writer

When Panther sweeperback Don
in his scenic

never heard much about the Penn
State booters and their third-place
ranking in the NCAA last season.
Now that Bowen is a fundamental

part of the Panther lineup his

foremost concern, especially
tonight, is the Nittany Lions. 3
Bowen, a first-year man with the
Panthers, has ‘ never -faced the
boQ_ters’ arch-rival—Penn State.
He's heard the stories, though,
about his teammates’ upset victory
over the Nittany Lions. It was a 2-0

shutout the last time that the two _

teams met at Pittstadium. Bowen

I is hoping that he can aid the Pan-

thers I0-repeat their performance of
the "1978 season and keep their
undefeated status on the home turf.

‘ “I’ve never faced Penn State but

, I certainly have heard a great’ deal

about them,” said Bowen.
“Especially since we’ve been doing
well this season, the icing on the

\L

cake will be to defeat Penn State,
and it will be great 'doing it at
home.” "

Bowen,‘ although in his first
season with the Panther booters,
has a great deal of experience and
knowledge under his belt. The man
who holds the responsibility of be-
ing the last line of defense between

the opposition and goalkeeper Scott

I

Thunberg is quite a bit different

than the average Panther freshman.

The Canadian chose to sit out a»-few,,_
years before coming to continue his ""

education and his collegiate soccer
career. So, at age 21, Bowen brings

with him a great deal of maturity to «

an otherwise young Panther squad.

Johnny Majors and present coach
Jackie Sherrill- But according to
the Panther coach, that’s
ridiculous. , -

“I don’t have to play and John
Majors doesn’t have to play. lt’s
the players that have to play,” said
Sherrill. “If we (Majors and
himself) had to play there’d be all
‘kinds of bets.”

9 At yesterday’s football press con-
ference, the Tennessee coach spoke.
over the phone. to tell about his
team.‘ «

“We’re in the processof growing
up down here,” said Majors. “We
have a mature schedule without a

. mature football team.”

The Volunteers‘ will enter the
game with a 3-3 record. That is‘

 

‘)2’-f.i-.rNSv'>;V

rather misleading since the three
losses were to USC, Georgia, and
Alabama, all top-ten teams. In the
first two, the Vols were in the games
to the end, with only the Tide blow-

ing them out last week.

Majors said of his team"s record,

“Nobody wants to be 3-3, but it’s a
heck of a lot better than being 0-6.”

According to coach Majors, the

game against Pitt will be a. stiff -
challenge. It will be a tremendous

adjustment from preparing for
Alabam_a(last week) and preparing
for Pitt. ' ’

“We prepared for the wishbone"

offense and. now we have to turn

around to prepare for a team like
Pitt,” said Majors. “They have the
best receiving group we’ve-faced so '
far this year.” . ‘

Majors also pointed out that, in
addition to Pitt’s receivers, the Pan-
ther offensive line will pose a
menacing task for his defense.
According to Majors, Pitt’s line is
bigger than USC’s.7 ‘

The former P.itt coach expressed
his opinion that Pitt looks-to be
more difficult to handle on defense
than Alabama, even though the

, Tide held the Vols to 59 yards of

total offense last week. Offensively

the two teams can’t compare, ac- 5

cording to Majors, because they are
so different, Alabama being a
wishbone running attack-and Pitt
being pass-oriented. At one point,
coach Sherrill interrupted his
former boss by saying, “Stop trying
to throw up a smoke screen,” refer-
ring to the way Majors portrayed
the game to be a mis-match.
According to-Sherrill, the Vols

fense, capable of makingthe big

Pitt’s biggest question mark will '
be the defensive secondary which

has been plagued‘ with injuries.

Both Terry White and Carlton

Williamson have been injured, and q_

perhaps more unusual is the injury

at quarterback, and Marine should
be ‘able to play if and when he is
needed during the game.

Admidst the flow of Oakland
runners rambling through the
streets these days one might chance
to catch a glimpse of Pitt’s cross
country -team. They’re the ones
with the quicker pace.

Early morning and afternoon
work—outs have paid off for the har-
riers. They were successful at their
first two meets of the 1980 season at
Rutgers in the Eastern Eight Cham-
pionships andin the 10 Kilometer
road race at North Park. And this
past weekend, Pitt placed ninth out
of thirty teams at the West Virginia
Invitational. ~ _

Top runners Randy Bailey and
Bob Landstrom led the team to a
fourth place finish behind Rhode
Island and ahead of West Virginia
at the E.E. Championships. The
fourth place finish was Pitt’s.
highest placement in the last three
years. “ A

Randy had a time of 25:13 and Bob

minutes per mile. Our freshman,
Todd Colas, did well placing 32nd
senior harrier, Randy- Bailey
The Rutgers course consisted of a
fairly hilly, grass park terrain, said
senior harrier, Randy Bailey.
“Considering it was our first race,
my goal was tofinish in the top ten,
so basically I was happy with my
ninth place finish.”
“-Bob (Landstrom) has been

he ran a tough race,” added'Bailey.

“Hutch: (John Hutchinson) is

stronger this year too.” Hutchinson

placed fourth for Pitt at Rutgers

with a time‘ of 27:09.”

The harriers competed in their se-
cond ,meet Oct. 5, in, the Ten

Park. The 6.2 mile race, sponsored
by Athletic Attic and in conjunc-
tion with the Pittsburgh Marathon,
broughtthe Panthers to a first place

and said he was hurting as he
crossed the finish line. He added
that he hadn’t been in the leading
position for a long time and that he
looks at each race as a countdown
to the next.

In the team’s third meet, at the
West Virginia Invitational this past
weekend, the harriers faced" 29
other t_eams including West
Virginia, Slippery Rock, Allegheny

-‘ﬁowen. “Because I am a freshman,

I still feel like I’m at the bottom of

the ladder, but because I’m older

than most of the rest of the team it

tends to -neutralize the effect.”

After finishing high school (13
years worth in Ontario in order to
continue to the university level) in
1977, Bowen stayed with soccer by
playing on a senior _men’s league
and a semi-professional team for a
season.

 - “I had played with this senior
‘gem since I was 15 and I continued
to play with them after high school
ball was over,” said Bowen. “I
also had the opportunity to play a
year of semi-pro ball before coming
to Pitt.”

1

Bowen believes that it is the ex-
perience that he gained from his
teammates in these two leagues that

‘ has contributed the most to his im-
provement and growth in soccer.
By playing with a number of
English, Scottish, and Irish players
during these years Bowen learned a

great "deal that has made him so ‘

essential in the. Panthers’ winnin
season. - v

~13 “The men’s league helped me a 4

lot because of the quality of players
that Ifcompeted with and against,”
said Bowen. They were older guys
\and, some had played in the premier
leagues of, England, which is the
highest over there. Also, when .I
played semip-pro there was a-cap-
tain on the team nained Tommy
’Henderson who I give a great deal
‘of credit to for teaching me the
finer points of the game. He had

By Scot Stone
» Pitt News Sports Writer 1
The Pitt‘ women’s volleyball
squad came away from the Cincin-
natti Invitational Tournament with

- a 2-3 record last weekend. The

Pantherettes beat Cleveland
(15.-12, 15-12), and Ohio State
(14-16, 15-11, 15-6), but lost to
Kentucky, (9-15, 15-10, 7-15)
Purdue, (13-15, 3-15) and
Nebraska, (10-15, 1-15).

“I think there are several reasons

‘we didn’t do as well as we wanted"

to,” Pantherette coach Shelton
Collier said. “We had developed a
new offense at this tournament us-
ing sophmore Julie Gaul as our
primary setter, and the teams we
were playing are more accustomed
to ‘ playing better teams than we
are.’’— p
The three teams Pitt lost to were

‘ .‘ ._ ._ 1 A I A . . I .\ 4

Purdue, the '

. ._ .\ . .. . A

strongest among them, is ranked

10th nationally.
-‘>‘I don’t think that Purdue is

necessarily an outstanding-team,"” _

Collier said. “It’s just that they’re

a team that doesn’t make’

mistakes. ’,’ _
Collier," in spite of his team’s

showing, regards this type of na-'

tional competition°as valuable ex-
perience for the squad.

“I think one thing we found in
these matches is, that we probably
don’t play as good a defense that we
would need to play on the national
level,” Collier said. “What we’re
going. to do between now and the
nationals is to work on that
defense.” '5‘

“At the tournament,” Collier‘

said, “We were trying to getmore
tall people up to the‘ net to increase
our blocking strength.” .

A key to ‘an improved defense

will depend on Julie Gaul.

“I was very happy with the way '

she played,” Collier said. “She has
a lot of room to get better, but we
need to put in a taller teamfor some
of the competition we’ll be facing.
So we’ll be working with her a lot.”

In general terms, Collier thinks

that it is possible for the eastern ‘

region to’ improve, but that ex-
posure is essential. . ,
“Exposure is definitely the key to

a successful team,” Collier said?» --

“For us to go to these types of tour-

naments once or twice a year, when .

the otherteams are going every
week makes it nearly impossible for
us toikeep pace. It would be much
better if we could play more of
these national tournaments, but
that is financially impossible.I think
the East, as a region, is improving

'though.”Collier said, “But it’s a

slow road.”
