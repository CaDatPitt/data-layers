Faulty Towers elevators have

two minutes or less," said a cam-
pus police officer who wished to
remain unidentified. Faulty ele-
vators_were blamed for the delay.
In another case, police person-
nel who were answering an emer-
gency on the 22nd floor of Tower

. B were forced to literally abandon

the car on the 19th floor and run
up the last three flights carrying
their emergency equipment with
them.

According to a campus police
officer who also preferred not to
be identified, the call key for the
middle elevator of Tower B is

plained that if an emergency oc-

to the main floor before theycan
take control of it.

“If you get the middle elevator.
you got a little more room to work
he said. referring to
stretcher cases. It's better suited
for emergencies because it is
larger and can stop on any floor.
But he also said. "If you don't get
the middle elevator, you‘re in bad
shape." ,

But. according to a man who is

involved with the elevator main-.

tenance, the Towers elevators
have been operating much better
than previously. The man. who

' also wished to remain anonymous,

said he can prove the elevators
are working better by checking
the time sheets that must be
maintained which show the
amount of maintenance done on
them.

According to the man, the only
elevator that wasn’t working
properly was in Tower C, and
Westinghouse which has the main-
tenance contract is not at fault.
The maintenance man wouldn’t
say who was at fault nor who was
working on it.

As for the so-called faulty ele-
vator in Tower B that stopped. he

claimed that it was checked out
but nothing was found wrong with
it.

Donovan Hughes, assistant to
the director of Housing. said that

less maintenance than usual/has ~

been done on the elevators but in
the long run, he believes that
Westinghouse has spent many
more hours of maintenance than it
normally _ does on
“Thier contract doesn't specify
the number of hours." he explain-
ed.

The elevator maintenance man

said be firmly believes that unau- .

thorized or bootleg keys are avail-

able to students, who by us-
ing the keys, take the car out of
the computer system,‘ making it
impossible for it to answer calls.

Hughes dismissed the notion

that students have unauthorized,

keys and claimed instead‘ that stu-
dents find other keys that fit the

lock on the control panel of the car-

He also said that within a week
or two, an "orientation" on how
to operate the elevators using the
call keys would be set up for the

, maids, janitors, and security per-

sonnel. Apparently, the Housing
office feels that some familariz-
ing with the elevators is needed by
those who have keys. -

"Hughes said that Westing-
house's position concerning the
elevators is that "the cars don't
work because students beat the
hell out of them." He suggested-
that students might justifiably
claim that they beat the hell out
of the elevators because they
don’twork.

An’ Oaklandrental agency has
recently become the target of stu-

However, the students charge that
Nernberg is withholding amounts
for no valid reason.

A former Pitt student, Bob Don-
aldson, said he was informed that
“everything was fine” when he
moved out of the apartment he
shared with two friends. A few
months later, however, Donaldson
was charged an additional $298
above the security deposit. In his
own opinion, he was actually due
a$92 refund. ,

At that time, Donaldson receiv-

Seventy Commuters Form

by RON LOZOWSKI
Feature Editor

The recent Commuter Associa-
tion car pool registration
turnout, though small. was never-
theless "encouraging." according
to Bob Taylor, chairman of the
committee coordinating the drive.

Taylor was especially impress-
ed with the high ratio of' drivers to
riders. Of the 70 commuters sign-
ing up. 30 were drivers offering
rides.

Taylor felt that the main rea-
son for the limited participation
was the lack of publicity accord-
ed the affair. “When this thing
was dropped in my lap.'I didn‘t
haveimuch. time to prepare." he

‘explained. Much of ‘the response

 

came from commuters learning
of the signup by word of mouth.
Taylor added.

Originally, it was plamied that
there be a single registration date.
However, the CA has since de-
cided to conduct the service as “a
continuing thing,” said Taylor.
Interested commuters may sign
up at the CA office, 518 SU.

The CA is alsoplanning to host
another mass registration session
in two or three weeks. Meanwhile.
Taylor considers it vital that com-
muters be made aware of the exis-
tence of the pool.

The CA is therefore publishing
a list of drivers. to be distributed
on the ground floor of the Stu-
dent Union tomorrow. It will be

Speaking for the alumni advi-
sors, John Morrow of Kappa Sig-
ma outlined the complaints in five
areas: noise, dirt, trash and gar-
bage accumulation, parking, and
language. He agreed with the resi-
dents that “a bad situation exists”
but that both groups would have to
work together to resolve the sit-
uation.”

the responsibility of the individual
students to take the initiative in
contacting drivers and reaching
amenable ' arrangements. Regis-
tration forms for the pool will also
be made available at that time.

“lt’s definitely a good thing for
commuters,” Taylor remarked.
He pointed out benefits for both
sides: drivers may reduce ex-
penses by sharing costs, at the
same time sparing riders the in-
convenience of “waiting for a bus
in the freezing cold.”,

Taylor would like to see the car
pool in full operation by the begin-
ning of November. “We hope to
have everything put down and in
order by the time the snow flies.“
he said.

Jack Freeman. former execu-
tive assistant to the Chancellor,
doesn't like to waste time. Only
last month he assumed presiden-
tial duties at the University's
Johnstown branch, and he has‘al-
ready launched an array of pro-

‘_ jects designed to facilitate change.

 

FREEMAN
Lacks Funds

" Among Freeman's ambitions is
expansion of Johnstown into a
four-year institution. “Presently
we have four-year programs in
Elementary Education and Engi-
neering Technology," he said. but
students in other fields transfer
to the Oakland branch for their
last two years. “Next year we‘ll
have four-year"programs in the
Social Sciences, Humanities. and
Natural Sciences." assured Free-
man.

Committed to academic reform
while in Pittsburgh, Freeman has
continued in that direction in
Johnstown. The President said he
is striving for "an educational
program suited to the needs of
students," and "beneficial to
Western Pennsylvania and the

 

>-'~~University of Pittsburgh.“ He un-

derlined the need for "a flexible
and innovative curriculum. con-
sisting of many interdisciplinary
coursesf’

Some of the differences between
Johnstown and Oakland, Freeman
noted, are size and environment.
“Here (Johnstown) we have an
enrollment of only 1,900 stu-
dents,” he said, “and our loca-
tion is in a suburban collegiate at-
mosphere. The Oakland branch is
much larger and is in an urban
climate.”

Although the students at John-
stown are similar to Oakland stu-
dents in SAT scores and high
school rank. he said. they differ in
that most of them come‘from re-
mote areas. “Only about
live in the, dorms. whereas most

of them are commuters from
small towns and- small high
schools."

Discussing the problems plague-
ing Johnstown, Freeman cited
one also common to the Oakland
campus. "Our major "obstacle is
budget—we just can't find
enough funds." V-

One dilemma peculiar to Johns-
town concerns its location. “We
are five miles from the main
city,” Freeman explained, “and
we are isolated. We have a shuttle
bus service which facilitates
transportation into the city.”

The Johnstown campus also suf-
fers from lack of facilities, which
inhibits its aspiration for rapid
growth. "The General State Au-
thority has recently" approved
plans for a new Engineering build-
ing." Freeman remarked. "and
we want to build a field house.

"Since we have 600 acres of
land." he added; "we don‘t have
conflicts with the community as
Oakland does in its expansion pro-
ject. and we don't have a parking
problem."

Now Undergmdutzte Academic Review

Course Evaluation Book Revised

by JOYCE GEMPERLEIN

Now preparing a full-fledged
student publication. the Course
Evaluation Committee has
changed the name of its book to
the Undergraduate Academic Re-
view. With the name change
comes a variety of innovations in
format.

In the past.Course Evaluation
has contained computer printouts
based on questionnaires filled out

-V-by students regarding specific

courses. On the basis of both the

J statistical data and students‘ writ-

the Committee
each
course and wrote critiques. The
goal of the book was to keep the
student informed on the courses
and professors at the University.

A preview of the coming edition
with co-chairman of the commit-
tee. Rudy Potenzone. revealed
several additions to the, previous
statistics and critique. In addi-
tion. Potenzone said, there will be
a trilogy of articles. ‘

ten comments.

“This issue, ‘which deals with
courses offered last winter, is ex-
pected to be ready between Oct.
13 and 15. The three additional
sections are basically articles.
The first concerns different as-
pects in education; the second,
new curriculum reform in the

University, and the third, deals _

with new methods in education.
These’ articles will continue each
year and we hope to add a feature
story in the future,” Potenzone

said.

Another difference in the Win-
ter 1971 issue is the manner in
which ' the questionnaires were
distributed. Previously. students
were sent to each classroom to
distribute and collect the compu-
ter cards. Last winter the cards
were sent to teachers with a let-
ter explaining the process. The
instructors were asked to pass
the questionnaires out and then

mail them in a sealed envelope to
the Committee.

When asked how this affected
the comments. Potenzone explain-
ed: "Surprisingly enough. the
‘average course‘ received a higher
rating. Either Pitt professors are
getting better or only the better
instructors passed the forms out."

The comments and statistics, A
Potenzone said, will be paired un-
der the course name and number
as before, but the statistics will
be easier to comprehend.

* "In this issue," Potenzone add-
ed, "we have dedicated an entire
page—empty, of 'course——to the
Nursing School. We have received
numerous gripes from nurses on’
their courses, but the Nursing
School refuses to allow‘ their stu-
dents to evaluate them. All other
cabinets—CAS. Engineering. Par-
macy. and Education -— have co-
operated with us. The Nursing
School must feel that they are
above criticism."

The Undergraduate Academic
Review is distributed free to the
student body. Last year 5,000

- copies were doled out at booths

in the Student Union. Towers. and
Cathedral in less than five hours.
This year 7.000 copies of the re-
view will be available.

Potenzone gave a I brief sum-
mary of the budget of the Course
Evaluation Committee: “This re-
view cost approximately«$3,000 to
have printed and an additional $1,-

‘000 for miscellaneous expenses
, such as keypunch, printing of

questionnaires, and office sup-

Another new development for
the Undergraduate Academic Re-
view is the establishment of a
Center for the Improvement of
Teaching by Dean Jerome Schnee-
wind. Dr. Grace Lazouik has been
appointed director of the effort.
The executive board is comprised
of a student from each cabinet and
faculty members.

The board is presently working
out a new questionnaire designed
to pull out specific information.
Another decision by the board has
been to delete disparaging re-
marks about the personal char-
acteristics of an instructor. These
comments will be relayed to the
instructor in conf_id_ence. This de-

cision will take effect with the I

Glee Club Harbors

"c 38 Musician-Clowns

by LINDA COOPER

Walking down the hall, you can
hear them first. Deep laughter,
random chords on a keyboard.
shouts across the room. A room
bare with only some scattered
chairs_ and a piano, and bright
with the unmistakable enthusiasm
of the University of Pittsburgh
Men‘s Glee Club. Energy and tal-
ent—the raw materials necessary

E for good music and good times.

"Listen Girk, go back to bed——
we want to rehearse today!"

"Hey Mojock, are you back to
show everyone what a good singer
isn‘t?"

Except for the piano in the back-
ground, the scene had the makings
of any locker room or stag party,
complete with a few off-color
jokes about playing an organ in
concert. At this point, only a rous-

‘ ing rendition of “Taps” would

have been surprising.

But they are a surprising group:
a few magic chords sounded, and
instant order reigned over the
previousuproar. Chairs were ar-
ranged and throats cleared. The
Glee Club approached its first se-
lection with asjmuch vigor as it
had the horse play moments be-
fore.

Philip S. Cavanaugh directs the
38 members in an informal man-
ner_ that allows full expression of
this energy. As he leads them, his

- hands reflect this philosophy. The

motions are distinct but gentle,
his fingers softly curved. A light
touch is revealed even in
strong crescendos of the music.

While he continually corrects
the group on pronunciation, phras-
ing, and blend, “Phil’Z is not turn-

ed off by a hopeful but unconvinc-
ing “that wasn't me, the baritones
did it.” However, he is strict in
the standards he sets for the
group, and they respond in re-
hearsal with the verve present in
a performance. When they sing
Celebration. it is just that.

The reason for this responsive-
ness may be related to President
Steve Nedimyer's observation
that the members present at re-
hearsal were there because they
wanted to be there. This was re-
iterated by John Dorsey. a junior.
as he grinned, “I wouldn‘t belong
to any other . . 

The roots of this enthusiasm
can be traced partly to the social
aspects of the club. Nedimyer
claims ,it is ‘basically a close
group with a dash of good-natured
rivalry between new and old
members. At a three-day camp in
the fall these factions may oppose
each other for a football game but
team up later for other activities
such as the new member dinner.
election banquet, and various par-
ties on the road.

The Girk mentioned is the most
unabashed clown of the club, who
receives an award for his tom-
foolery and is dubbed “Girk” for
a year. ‘

The Clubs varied programs in-_
clude staged musical revues. pop-
ular music, traditional selections.
a barbershop quartet, and a folk
group. Four concerts have been
scheduled at Pitt, the next being
an appearance at the Chancellors
Reception Oct. 8. The traditional
Fall, Winter, and Spring Tours
will carry them to Washington,

Standards

Terincd ‘Ridiculous’

The standards set for Pennsyl-

tioned by a group tentatively call-
ed “Students Concerned About

About 40 people met Friday to
discuss the regulations and their
own experiences and problems
with them.

According to Bob.\,Nelson and
Gladys Unger‘, leaders of the
group. the residency require-
ments are sometimes not only
unfair but ridiculous. "In one
case.“ Nelson said, "a woman
from Pennsylvania married an
out-of-state man and had to pay
out-of-state tuition. Then they got
separated, and she still has to pay
out-of-state tuition."

‘College Middlemen

by MIKE HAL-EY
Staff Columnist

One of the- main problems facing students now is- that they
'can‘t keep pace with the skyrocketing costs of higher education.

._ The only long-run solutionvto this financial squeeze is to im-
’ pI:ove_the management of universities. Teaching productivity must
be increased. The unneeded luxuries resulting from the status-con-
scious life style of universities must be eliminated. All of these

' actions would reduce costs to students.

. _ But most of us can’t wait for tomorrow. We need money now.
;Congress seems to understand this need. More than $1 billion a
year would go to the nation’s 2,500 colleges under a higher educa-
tion bill recently approved by the House Education and Labor Com-
..inittee. I

 "iThe Senate already has’ passed a higher education bill offer-
‘ ing-$700 million a year in operating subsidies for colleges. _

 However: this approach of financing colleges directly won't
1. have the impact Congress hopes for in aiding. students.

. V 1 Too many times this money will pay for new building programs,
{bigger university staffs, fatter pay checks for faculty members and
' administrators, and a larger expense account for the chancelllor.

‘lThese increased expenses will hardly improve education tex-

cept to underwrite the status quoi or reduce costs payed for by both
-_ students and taxpayers. ' '

 _.What we need is a change in direction. Congress supposedly
gthen. bother’ siphoning money through colleges in order to assist
 ti-idents? _ . ' -' - .
Universities are very expensive middlemen and should be by-
‘  passed. Instead, Congress should start aiding students directly.

Population Crisis A

Birth Control Realistic

by LEE EILS
Staff Columnist

The movement for equality of opportunity and
equitable distribution of political and economic
power is necessary and healthy. but sadly incom-
plete. Third world peoples and their non-third‘-
world'allies have demonstrated little concern
with a crucial aspect of the total problém—the
population crisis.

In. America the black movement is the larg-
est movement of third-world peoples
characterized by unity. purpose and awareness of
culture. but black men and women have failed
to realize the magnitude of the obstacle facing
them as the population begins to outstrip its
available means of support. -

They are not alone in this misperception.
White America has failed to recognize the im-
portance of the population explosion. In both
cases, this failure is under-
standable but, in neither, is it
justifiable.

Americans are aware of over-
population. They are certainly
aware-of the many problems
facing the society in which they
live. Unfortunately. they rarely _
link the two.. '

A plea_ for mutual effort in
‘attempt to control population can_ sound like a

"racists euphemism for. "if you can’t beat them
yniggers or at least shut ‘em up. eliminate ‘e‘m.“ __

Birth control is viewed by many‘ as genocide
of the black race. This is unfortunate but can
seem to make sense viewed from the block's
perspective. . _ '

Birth control efforts are the strongest in’ low
income areaslwhere families of more than two
predominate—the ghetto. Birth control adminis-
trators are predominantly white and’ birth con-
trol efforts seem most concentrated in the ghetto.

Response to birth control in the white com-
munity has been considerably less hostile because
birth control is viewed not as a threat to the exist-
encevof thewhite race. but as a'pleasant_alterna-
tive to what may be eventual deprivation for all.

Many birth control people feel the “genocide” .
idea ‘was planted in the black mind by the Catho-

lic church in an attempt to muster support for its
own doctrines regarding birth control.

A more realistic examination of birth control
efforts renders another conc1usion..Does popula-
imply gradual elimination of the
black race in America? The aim is zero popula-
tion growth. not zero population. H .

Is it realistic to assume that a leveling off \of
the populations. both black and white. will rob
the black movement of its power? Will black
people be prevented from representing their own
interests‘? Can they be? Will progress toward

yality. Productivity

» eliminated. _
For third world peoples and non-third-world 

equality of opportunity and equitable distribution
of power be eliminated?" Can it be? Noneof it
seems likely, if current trends are any indica-
tion. ’

What does seem likely is that poverty and
abject existence will become greater realities
unless the population is controlled. If we, as a
society, have arrived at a point‘ where the race
with the largest population and/or following
shall dominate and it has become a contest to
see who can outproduce whom,then poverty and
suffering will endure and grow and eventually
bring civil war. ' _

If the desired effect is a shift in rather than
an equitable redistribution of power. it is dan-
gerously naive to assume that any" improvement
in the quality of life can result.

The interests and needs of
black Americans. white Ameri-
cans. Mexican Americans. and
American, Indians are going to
be most effectively communi-
cated and represented and met
when the children of each race
or ethnic group grow up in an
environment which can support
its ' existence materially.

There really can't be any separation of goals
along-this line. The problem commands the atten-
tion of everyone in society. _

It becomes a trade off between the quality
of lifeand the quantity of life. As scarcity is and
always will be a fact of- life, the former must
take precedence over the later. - ’

Any ‘group of human beings is going tolreactl

adversely to’ cramped living conditions andldepri-

vation. As population grows.'these problems be-

come more acute.

Poverty, however, need not be the only eventu-
in the American economy -

grows at a rate of 3 percent toi4 percent annu-

‘ally. If population can be held constant, it is

conceivable that, in ‘a relatively short period of
time, poverty, as we know

peoples, the most effective means toward a
mutually‘-desired end becomes birth control.“
It is mere self-deception to assume that existing

it, can be virtually '

‘W

 

 

political and economic machinery can support 

the interests of an ever-growing population.

The pie is only so big and grows only so fast.
and to assume that political activism or even
revolution is going to increase the size of" the
pie without limit is sheer fantasy.

Something has got to give and it had better

be the number’ of mouths, black. yellow, red and 
white. . V _  '

If you're a commuter. or even if
you're not a commuter. you prob-
ably know about the outrageous
parking conditions here at Pitt.

- A student may drive around for 15

minutes looking for a parking
space and still end up feeding a
dollar and a half to the meter for
one day. Persons who don‘t put
money in their meters are often
seen leaning over their cars. tick-

And. of course. the target of

meter maid has become the most
feared ‘enemy of the commuter
student. Students think of meter
maids’ as cold-hearted old spins-
ters. Students believe the ladies
enjoy findin_g meters with the red

out another tag.

In spite of this opinion and the
fact that I’ve been tagged a few
times myself, Iwondered if meter
maids were all that heartless. To
satisfy my curiosity I decided to

‘interview oneof the ‘fenemies-of

Mltlti-Meditt Montage

Mirrors Beatles ’ E ra

by LOIS LEVINSON

Something different and excit-
ing is coming to Pittsburgh in the
form of a multi-media inontage—
a fitting form in which to present
the phenomenon that is “The Bea-
tles."

The show consists of a succes-
sion of visuals keyed to a chrono-

- logy of Beatles songs. The produc-

tion uses 26 projectors pro-

grammed by a computer and en-
gulfs the audience in music with a
360-degree sound system.

 

This new art form will revive
the field of entertainment where
there has been a decline in audi-
ence interest and a wish for some-
thing new and unusual. In this age
of spectators, many of us would
like to be immersed. Perhaps this
type of show about which a critic
said, “To experience it is essen-
tial. To describe it is impossible."
is an answer to entertainment en-
nui.

The show. which has played to
sold-out houses all over the coun-
try and received terrific reviews.

THE BEATLES: Away with Words

Richard Mehagian, originator
and producer of The Beatles:
Away with Words, explains that
“speakers will be onstage,above,,
and around the audience. You’ll
be able to feel the music or experi-
ence it, as opposed to just listen-
ing to it.”

The format begins in the late
50's and includes such diverse
sections as segments from 2001:
A Space Odyssey and film from
the Kennedy assassinations. Some
of the visuals move at very high
speeds giving a strobe-light ef-
feet, while others are in slow mo-
tion.

"Were holding a looking glass
up to our society." Mehagian said.
“The Beatles have had such a tre-
mendous impact on our society
and whether people understand
them or not, their music has had
an effect on communication. It
has broken certain barriers. The
Beatles can communicate to all
types of people anywhere in the
world. and for that reason, the
show will probably tour abroad.”

“In this most unusual experi-
ence,” he pointed out, “your body
is permeated with the music that
represents the age‘: The Beatles
are the focal point. The magnifi-
cence of their work is interpreted

with reverence as we pay homage '
to musical genius. One critic,
wrote: .‘The feeling of watching

life on another planet.”

In 'Sleeping Beauty’

Fonteyn, Ballet Sparkle

by LYNNE WINSTEN

It is appropriate that Tschai-
kovsky's The Sleeping Beauty
should herald the awakening of
the arts in Pittsburgh this season.
Marius Petipas‘ paragon of classi-
cal choreography was presented
at the Syria Mosque Friday night.

In its premiere performance by
the National Ballet of Washington-
D. C.. guest artists Dame Margot
Fonteyn of the Royal Ballet in the
title role, and Attilio Labis of the
French Opera Ballet as Prince
Florestan were featured.

Dame Margot‘s portrayal of
the Princess Aurora has become
a legend ever since Sleeping
Beauty’s rivival in post WWI Lon-
don commemorated the reopening
of the Royal Opera House in Con-
vent Garden. The fairytale has
come to symbolize the dream of
beauty that hope emancipates
from nightmare of reality.

An ethereal auraenveloped the
entire production. The scenery
and costumes by Peter Farmer,
and the lighting design by Eugene
Lowery provided the loom upon
which the fabric of fantasy was
spun: the misty impressionistic
colors of the backdrops descend-
ing into dreamlike depths, the
gossamer garments emphasizing
the grace of the human body in
movement, and the diaphanous

drapery, suggestive of the thin
veil suspended between dream
and reality—the delicate precari-
ousness of dew dangling from cob-
webs.

Fonteyns interpretation of the
role was likewise reminiscient of
dew-flecked Cobwebs. Her incar-
nation as the 16-year-old princess
was somewhat hampered by her
appearance: she may be a young
52. but she is an advanced 16.
Nonetheless. by Act II «the Awak-
ening» the cobwebs were brushed
aside. and only the dew was evi-
dent.

She convincingly portrayed the
shy young maiden awakening from
the blissful sleep of innocence
(perhaps the rest did her good i.

Her execution of Petipas’ most
difficult and demanding move-
ments was incredibly agile and
controlled. Premiere danseur At-
tilio Labis was no only extremely
powerful, yet graceful, but pro-
vided an excellent foil for Dame
Margot. The entire company, un-
der the artistic direction of Fred-
eric Franklin, performed bril-
Iantly. Their precision and line
was remarkable.

I was amazed at how sensitive-
ly attuned the dancers were — the
corps de ballet was just that — one
fluid body moving in perfect syn-

chronization. Even beyond physi-
cal prowess and technical perfec-
tion. however. was the enthusiasm
of this young company. which ani-
mated what might otherwise have
been just another pretty picture.
with exuberant vitality. Espe-
cially notable was Luis Fuentes’
aerial acrobatics as the Bluebird
in Act III.

The fludidity with which the
fantasy unfolds was the result of
carefully coordinated efforts. It
was a triumph of classical com-
position: the symmetry of the
staging. the costuming. scenery.
and choreography.

Tschaickovsky’s score, which is
in itself a masterpiece, does not
dominate the dancing, but compli-
ments it, and flows through space
along with the dancers. It is the
unity of this artful blending of
elements that underlies the pro-
duction’s effectiveness.

As for the true test of artistic
merit — although the full-length
performance lasted three and one-
half hours. few people left before
the curtain closed on the final
act. The audience itself appeared
revitalized and clamored enthusi-
astically for curtain calls.

All in all. it was a stimulating
evening.

  Revenge Spices  

by MARTY HELLMAN

Associate Sports Editor
A fired-up, revenge- minded
West Virginia team took advan-
tage of many Panther errors on
Saturday afternoon to whip the
Cats 20-9. to the delight of an
overflow Homecoming crowd in

Morgantown. West Virginia.

The Mountaineer defense.
which proved its toughness
in previous games, held the high
scoring Panther offense to just
one touchdown and a field goal.
They thwarted four other drives
with interceptions, and halted
another with a crucial fumble
recovery. ' '

Pitt Coach Carl DePasqua
tried numerous combinations
in the Panther backfield in

order to get the club rolling. All
three quarterbacks. Dave Havern,
Bob Medwid, and_ John Hogan
split the signal calling" duties
during the game.

Panther TD _with flanker Doug
Gindin in the final minutes of
the first half. After scrambling
away from two linemen, hespot-
who played s'_pl.it
end, at the goal line and lofted
the ball towards him. Gindin

made a leaping catch of the toss

over defender Tom-Geishouser.

The subsequent two point con-
version attempt failed when'John
Chatman was stopped short of
the goal line.

Moments earlier, Geishauser
had swiped the first of four Pan-
ther errant aerials. He grabbed a
Hogan pass at midfield and ran it

toss-up the main variable in deter_mining a_ v‘ictor becomes desire.
The match-up of strengths and we_aknesses- loses its potency and
the psychological factorsinvolved in the contest assume primary

importance.

When the West Virginia Mountaineers ran onto the field Sat-
urday afternoon the roar from a screaming crowd of 38,500 was
deafening. The student section overflowed with Mountaineer fans

forcing the excess eight and nine deep seated along the.sidelines.

The cheerleaders werealmost unnecessary in all the excitement and

commotion.

Both teams appeared confident, each equipped‘ with their own
particular assets. But the Mountaineers had more then that going for
them. They had -the whole city‘ of Morgantown, West Virginia on

their side. V

Driving down to Morgantown Saturday morning, I saw evidence
of this enthusiastic support all over the place. Once over the bor-
der separating Pennsylvania and West Virginia the onslought of

signs, billboards, and radio pitches began. Route 19 was dotted

/

with pro-Mountaineer slogans the most eloquent of which appear-
ed on a cardboard sign in front of a combination used car and
junk lot. The sign read ‘A‘Jack’s said beat '

Pitt.”

In the . city

_ a local radio
‘station encouraged fans to go ‘out to the
stadium and watch West Virginia roll,
over “the Pittsburgh Vocationaland Re-

 

back 28‘yards. Luckily for Pitt
WVU’s Kerry Marbury fumbled
shortly afterward and Glenn Hyde
recovered.

In the second half, the inter-

ceptions proved more costly."
Behind 13-9 in the final quarter,

the Panthers began a drive at’

their own nine yard line. Led
by Medwid’s and Lou Julian's
running, they had moved the
ball to the 25 yard line.

Medwid elected t0.‘thI‘0W on
third down. He was chased out
of the pocket and threw right
into the hands of safety Jack
Hines. who returned it to the six
yard line. Three plays later.
quarterback Bernie Galiffa rolled
in from the four to add an in-
surance touchdown.

Though the lead seemed in-
surmountable. the Panther of-

.fense tried again. The Mountain-

eer in the Pitt receiving corps
this time was Tom Zakowski.
who intercepted another Hogan
pass in the end .zone.

With only three minutes re-
maining in the contest, a repe-
tition of last year’s comeback
was not impossible. Though the
offense got one more chance to
score, Hogan hit WVU line-

backer Billy Mantooth on the

first play from_ scrimmage.

After the game, a disappoint-e

ed DePasqua admitted that.
“Their defense ‘-was ‘ great. but
there was«a definite breakdown
in our passing game."

Although the Panther defense
had relinquished 80 points in
the first two games, they held
the explosive Mountaineers to
only three sustained drives.

In the first half, Galiffa alter-
nated sideline pases to Harry
Blake with runs by speedy Mar-
bury and Pete Wood. ‘Similar to
the Oklahoma running attack,
the quick duo dashed outside the

' Pitt defense for long gains. It

took the Mounties only 10 plays
to move 87 yards for the score, -

- Minutes later, they performed
almost an instant replay of the
first drive; though it took them
one play more to hit paydirt.

The Panther defense missed an
opportunity to stop the second
WVU march when Marbury was
caught behind the line on a third
down run. The flashy sophomore
escaped two tackles to keep the
drive alive. -

The only other ‘time ‘that the
Mountaineers threatened was at
the ‘onset of the third quarter.
After advancing to the one-
yard line, Wood fumbled and Ed
Marstellar recovered, thereby
averting a certain score.

Pitt ’s Triple Option

by JERRY MYERS
Sports Editor

It is not unusual to see a college coach sending in plays from the
sidelines during the course of a game. usually in an effort to aid his
quarterback in directing an effective attack.

The rotation is usually a halfback or an end. WVU Coach Bob Bowd-
en sent in plays by rotating his split ends Harry Blake and Chris Potts.
during Saturday's Panther-Mountaineer contest. Coach Carl DePas-
qua countered with the rotation of John Moss and Stan Ostrowski for

much of the game.

But in addition to rotating halfbacks. DePasqua used all three of
his quarterbacks. sometimes in the same drive.

Dave Havern, John Hogan and
Bob Medwid all saw plenty of ac-
tion in the 20-9 loss suffered by
the Cats Saturday. According to
DePasqua, it was all part of the
game plan.

“The game plan was to juggle
quarterbacks,“ said the disap-
pointed Pitt mentor after the
game. "Just like we've done all
seasonf'

Whatever stresses this places
on the Panther helmsmen was not
readily apparent. All three quar-
terbacks showed poise and talent
on the field although the pressure
of the game situation forced them
into making costly mistakes.

“We had to pass,” commented
junior John Hogan, DePasquas
primary strike thrower. “Sur-

 

prisingly, there was so much
pressure out there.”

Hogan was reluctant to criticize
the Panther strategy but he did
admit that coming in off the bench
presented problems. Once in the
game there is a rhythm that de-
velops. A backfield becomes ad-
justed to each other and the quar-
terback finds the pace that he can
work at. If he's yanked at this
point, when he returns to the play-
ing field later in the game the ad-
justment must reoccur.

DePasqua is obviously attempt-
ing to utilize his resources to their
utmost. When Bob Medwid came
in to lead the attack he proceeded
to run with the ball time and time
again. Hogan concentrated on

moving the team through the air

E

BOB MEDWID
Added Pressure

and Havern did both, primarily
engineering the rushing attack.

It is certainly a tribute to the
squad to have such versatility in
the backfield but they may be pay-
ing a price for it._

John Hogan, Pitt’s primary passer in their tri—quarterback corps.
felt the brunt of the Mountaineer defense. Hogan was at the helm
for much of the critical fourth quarter. at a time when the Moun-
ties knew that Pitt had to go to the air.

“They were dropping seven men back," said Hogan. "I'd see
someone in the open and then someone else would cut it off. They
were spread straight across the field."

But there was more to it than that. “They wanted it more
than we did." he emphasized solemnly. -
