Salk to Continue Work
Here On I__’_ol_io Vaccine

Perfection oflVaccine Set as New 1
Goal For University Researcher

By

JACK OLENDER.

“I think that there is no doubt that hewill stay.”

So said Dr. William McEllroy, answering a query on Dr.‘

Jonas Salk’s immediate plans. The Dean of the School of
Medicine said on Monday that Salk would continue his pres-
ent work on the polio vaccine. Dr. Salk could not be con-

. tacted for comment, but his secretary said that he was go-

ing on with his day-to-day work. '
Deluged With Awards . V
Since his anti—polio vaccine was declared 80-90% suc-
cessful last Tuesday in Ann Arbor, Mich., Dr. Salk has been

deluged with awards and job of-¢

fers. Gov. Goodwin Knight of
California offered him a position in
bacteriological research for that
state.

Dean McEllroy lauded him for
his reactions to the acclamation.
He described Salk’s accomplish-
ment as “an outstanding contri-
bution to medicine in more ways
than one. Aside from the .polio
vaccine, which is an outstanding
accomplishment, Salk is a per-
fect example of a real medical
scientist.” McEllroy cited his
conservativeness and conduct
which is “what a scientist should
be.” \

Dr. Salk, professor and head of
the department of preventive
medicine at Pitt sinée July, 1954,
has been at the University of
Pittsburgh since 1947, most of
which time he has devoted to work

.on the development of polio and

inﬂuenza vaccines.

“The accomplishment of Dr.
Salk may well be the greatest con-
tribution to medicine in our gen-
eration,” said ‘Dr. Charles W.

Mayo, head of the Mutual 6: ,

Omaha board which named the
Pitt scientist as the winner of the
$10,000 Omaha Criss Award and
Gold Medal. 7 0

Over 400 scientists had been
nominated for the honor.

Outstanding American ,Award

The national executive commit-
tee of the Legion of Guardsmen
has voted to give Salk its Out-
standing American Award for
1955. A Silver Medal of Achieve-
ment will be awarded to the re-
seacher by the Poor Richard Club
of Philadelphia. The pr sident of
that organization has in ited him
to the city to receive the award in
person. ,

The Mutual Life Insurance
Company of New York has paid
tribute to Salk’s achievement
by lowering their insurance pre-
miums. Individual and family
hospital expense policies will

cost an average ﬁve per cent
less. Mutual’s President, Lous
W. Dawson said “. . _. the tests
. . . justify the immediate re-
appraisal and reduction of our
premiums for these coverages.”-

In spite of the world-acknow1-
edged success of the vaccine, Dr.
Salk has one regret about it——the
name. He told the press last week
that the title, “Salk Vaccine” de-
nies credit to all his assistants and
scientists throughout the years
who have been instrumental in its
development. '

will supply the discount cards for
the ﬁrst year, but will demand
Pitt membership in subsequent
years. NSA has pressed Pitt to

join their organizationusince they -

need a big school on their roll.

The Key to we Universe 

By Jim Deweese

Dr. Albert Einstein is dead.

The quiet and determined genius which led the
world into the atomic age died last Monday in
Princeton, New Jersey where he had devoted his
life to the study of theoretical mathematics.

Few men pause in their frantic stumblings for
worldly gain to consider the limitless expanse of
the universe and the truths, yet
unknown, which lie beyond the
stars. Dr. Einstein was one of
these few. He labored for 40
years on a uniﬁed ﬁeld theory
by which he hoped to prove that
there was one all encompassing
law which would explain the
blinding complexity of the uni-
verse and reduce it to its simplest
terms.

No means of providing his uniﬁed theory have
ever been found but neither was there proof for
such fore—going works as his theory of relativity
which is now universally accepted and has served
as the cornerstone for the atomic age.

Descensions Insignificant
It was ironic that so peaceful a man as Dr.
Einstein should see in his theories the feasibility

grips the world in a vice of fear and distrust was
subordinate to his main task. For, in opening the
wonders of a limitless universe to the world, man
could not help but see himself and his pretty quar-
rels and descensions in the scathing light of in-

 

signiﬁcance. ‘

Even though hailed as perhaps the greatest
scientist in the history of the world he held stead-
fastly to a ﬁrm belief in God. His words,,etched in
stone at Princeton University, echo the simplicity
which was so essential to his work. “God is subtle,
but He is not malicious.”

Dr. Einstein stated his political beliefs when he
said, “As long as I have any choice I will stay
only in a country where political liberty, toleration

and equality of all citizens before the law are _

the rule.”

Freedom Essential
This need for freedom and toleration was more
vital to this man than life itself for the work
which was his life could only have been carried
out in a country which granted these rights.‘
Time has taken its toll and, as the twentieth

century is relegated to the dust covered archives‘

of history it will take with it all the petty minds
and insigniﬁcant personalities of a restless era.
Only a few names will remain in the minds of
future generations. Dr. Albert Einstein will be one
of those who, like Pythagoras, Aristotle, Galileo,
and Newton, will be remembered.
Unique" Courage

He has gained an jmpregnable place in the fu-

‘discontent and suspicion, even as the very bomb

for which he had supplied the key threatened the
total_ destruction of the earth, he had the courage
to look far beyond the world of man as he reached
for the key to the universe.

Political parties were to be ofﬁcially disbanded after the
last ballot had been cast on election day. The fact that
they were not was dramatically emphasized at Monday’s
Student Congress elections as one party gained almost
total power of Congress. Nominees from the other party

was to lead the student body for the next two semesters.’

Several Congressmen asserted that this was the time
to-.forget political ties and work for the good of the Uni-
versity. Their pleas fell on deaf ears as one after another
of the prize offices in that organization found only one con-
testant for each position. The cry of the “silver tongued
politico” has been changed from “vote for me” to “I de-

cline the nomination.”

The healthiness of a political party system here at
Pitt is doubtful in the light of such circumstances. If a

raise funds for
c h a r i t a b le
causes.

We gained new insight into
subject which is unfortunately
hazy for the average student
here——the Campus Chest pro-
gram. The particular “Pitt
Chest” which this University runs
each year under YMCA spon-
sorship is a consolidated charity
drive to enhance collection of
funds and to relieve students of
constant fund-raising d r i v e s
throughout the year. It is not
unique in that many colleges
have found such a program
beneﬁcial.

Many Gharities Aided

The annual drive is held to
collect funds for special student
charities and national organiza-
tions: World University Service,
a world-wide organization which
provides funds and books to aid

 

charity groups, we were assured,
are more concerned with college
students being informed about
various causes to which they may
contribute than actual contribu-
tions raised.

The ultimate goal——-that- when
they leave college, students will
do so with a familiarity of what
charity is and what it is doing
so that they ’may intelligently
contribute to causes deemed to
be important.

Instead of stressing only one
charity each year, the Campus
Chest committee strives to put
across the idea of varied projects
—to -educate students about the
needs that exist both in and out
of our United States.

WUS Important’

It was only at the conference,
that this columnist became fully
aware of the impact of World
University Service, for example.

It may.
spread the cash thin, but that’s _

Tough to Give

So Pitt Chest chairman Clar-l

ence Kylander, vice-chairman
Meade Beers, and special projects
chairman Zora Getting will have
a big job on their‘ hands next
semester when the drive gets
under way——to educate college
students about the worth of giv-
ing. It’s a difficult task consid-
ering that most Pittites are con-
siderably more interested in
earning a few bucks for them-
selves than giving a couple to
help others. ‘

Of course, evaluation‘ of such
a drive will be almost an impos-

.sible ‘situation. The success of

Pitt Chest this year won’t be
measured by the amount of dol-

lars collected. Possibly one cri-'

teria might be the amount. of

Chest that takes place in the

Letters to the Editor

Politics Slammed

Editor, The PITT NEWS
Dear Editor,

During the recent turmoil and
mud—slinging known as an elec-
tion, many students, myself in-
cluded, stayed back apace and
evaluated the situation. I say,
with the ﬁrmest conviction, that
this school of our has gone over-
board on activities. They have
become the center of attraction
in the University. The emphasis
is now placed on politics rather
than on scholarship. The poli-
ticians are constantly running
out of meetings with their
respective blocs, forming coali-
tions, etc. What have these poli-
ticians accomplished for the
University except for possibly,
adding to the mess of papers on

the Tuck Shop ﬂoor? Oh yes,
they ‘succeeded in obtaining a
free ﬁfth hour for activities.
This feat, although short lived,
was nevertheless disgraceful . . .
it amounted to an almost total
disappearance of classes in favor
of activities at this particular
time. It is a black mark on the
record of the University ad-
ministration that they permitted
this.

I do not say that a University‘

should not support student poli-
tics, for politics are ﬁne as part
of a well—balanced University
life. >

Do these politicians really
desire to contribute to and ad-
vance the University? No, I have
found that their goal is to im-
prove their’ personal activities
record and to help their cohorts
and fraternity brothers get into

office. This I learned very
quickly three years ago as Presi-
dent of Freshman Council.

I believe that there are some
students who honestly try to
make a contribution to the Uni-
versity through politics but
these are in the minority.

When organizations such as
Phi Beta Kappa and the other
honoraries and when events such
as Scholars Day and councils

such as CSO receive second bil1- '

ing and elections and student
politics receive the importance
and top-billing, I think it is
time for a change. We must
either change our values or else
change the name of this build-
ing, from the Cathedral of

LEARNING to the Cathedral of
POLITICS.

Recreationcal *Facilitiesi
Necessary for Unions

,(Editor’s Note: This is the‘ third of a series of student union

articles written to show what facilities other schools have included in
their union with an eye towards determining Pitt’s need.)
i By BERNICE M. COHEN

In agreement with the old adage “All work and no play
makes Jack a dull boy,” Lotus D. Coffman, late president
of the University of Minnesota said, “Students are not in

the classrooms and laboratories all of the time.

It is for

this reason that the University is interested in maintaining a

proper social environment’?

K In many student unions, ball- 9

rooms provide the setting for
student dances and large social
functions. These affairs may be
held at a nominal cost.

Ballrooms Modern
The student union ballroom at
S outhern Methodist University
contains its own pantry which
provides refreshments at social
affairs.
At Ohio State, the Student Un-
i_on ballroom is arranged in a “T”
shape with a motorized wall
which can be opened to make the
‘room larger or smaller. Space for
1200 couples on the main dance
floor is a feature of the two story
main ballroom at the University
of Minnesota student union.
Craft shops and hobby setups
are featured at the University of
Connecticut and many other
schools. At one university union
facilities provide a 1000 ft. square
craft shop, music listening rooms,
and photography darkrooms. At
Ohio State, music continually
plays in a study lounge and five
music listening booths are avail-
able.
, Soda Shops Popular
For idle hours outside of the
classrom several universities re-
port several other permanent rec-
reational facilities. Unions at the
University of Kansas, University
of Miami, and the University of
Nebraska contain_ soda shops which
they call their -busiest corners.

i SCIENCE MADE SIMPLE: NO. is

  

Once again the makers of Philip Morris, men who are dedicated 9

to the betterment of American youth, have consented to let me
use this space, normally intended for levity, to bring you a brief
lesson in science. a

It is no new thing, this concern that the makers of Philip
Morris feel for American youth. Youth was foremost in their
minds when they fashioned their cigarette. They were aware
that the palate of youth is keen and eager, awake to the subtlest
nuances of ﬂavor. And so they made a gentle and clement smoke,
a suave blending of temperate vintage tobaccos, a summery
amalgam of the most tranquil and emollient leaf that their
buyers could ﬁnd in all the world. And then they designed their
cigarette in two sizes, king-size and regular, and wrapped them
in the convenient Snap-Open pack, and priced them at a ﬁgure
that youth could afford, and made them available at every
tobacco counter in the land. ~ , '

That’s what they did, the makers of Philip Morris, and I for
one am glad. ‘ '

The science that we take up today is called astronomy, from the

Greek words astro.meaning “sorq” and nomy meaning “back.” ,

Sore backs were the occupational disease of the early Greek
astronomers, and no wonder! They used to spend every blessed

night lying on the damp ground and looking up at the sky, and o

if there’s a better way to get a sore back, I'd like to hear about it.
Especially in the moist Mediterranean’ area, where Greece is
generally considered to be.

Lumbago and related disorders kept astronomy from becom-

ing very popular until Galileo, a disbarred ﬂenser of Perth, ’

fashioned a home made telescope in 1924‘out of three Social
Security cards and an ordinary ice cube. What schoolboy does
not know that stirring story-how Galileo stepped up to his
telescope, how he looked heavenward, how his face ﬁlled with

i wonder, how he stepped back and whispered the words heard

round the world: “L’eta.t, c’est moi!”
Well sir, you" can imagine what happened then! William

"Jennings Bryan snatched Nell Gwynne ‘from the shadow of the

guillotine at Oslo; Chancellor Bismarck brought in four gushers
in a single afternoon; ‘Hal Newhouser was signed by the
Hanseatic League; Crete was declared off limits to Wellington’s
entire army; and William Faulkner won the Davis Cup for his
immortal Peiirod and Sam. .

But after a while things calmed down, and astronomers began
the staggering task of naming all the heavenly bbdies. First
man toname a star was Sigafoosof Mt. Wilson, and the name
he chose was Betelgeuse, after his wife Betelgeuse Sigafoos.
prom queen at Michigan State College from 1919 to 1931.

Not to be outdone, Formﬁg of Yerkes Observatory nameda
whole constellation ‘after his wife, Big Dipper .Formﬁg, the

naming constellations after their wives — Capricorn, Cygni,
Orion, Ursa Major, Canis Major, and so forth. (The Major girls,

_, Ursa and Canis, both married astronomers, though, Canis subse-

quently ran off with a drydock broker named Thwaite Daphnis.)

A football team is like a padlock. It can be a strong,

powerful thing but to Work it needs a key—the quarter-

back.

With this in mind the Panther mentors have been keep-
ing a close‘ eye on the signal-callers in the spring drills.
This all—important spot was ﬁlled last year by sophomore
sensation Corny Salvaterra of Wilkes-Barre.

Providing the main competition again this year, as they
did last, are a couple of Salvaterra’s classmates —— Darrel
Lewis and Jim Lenhart. Right in step with these boys is
soph Dck Bowen, who is slated to: ‘
see duty both at quarter and at
lefthalf. ‘

Charleroi's Lenhart. Lenhart. is
probably the best passer of the
three but his running ability is
. not up to the others’. His passing,
though, could develop enough to
make him a top contender
Bowen, the only soph in the
group, has been showing well in
the workouts and, while he doesn’t
ﬁgure to win the starting berth,
should make things interesting
' among the reserves. ‘

Of course, the most logical can-
didate td enter the observer’s
mind would have to be Salvatarra
who created more than a mild
sensation when he took over that
spot last year. In the words of
Michelosen, “His runnng .threat is
tremendous and his passing is im-
proving.” ,

Giving Salvaterra. all he bar-
gained for, and more, in the fight
for the key position is Wilkins-
burg’s Lewis——a lefthanded passer.
As sometimes is the case with
lefties, Lewis’ big weakness is in
the passing department. He makes
up for this somewhat, however,
with his hard running and his
handling of the team. About Lew-
is, Michelosen commented, “He

student Apathy-
Widens the Gap

By DAVE MAZEB
Sports Editor

 

That famous quote, “There’s no place like home,” was
Written by John Howard Payne concerning patriotism but
the athletic department has learned that it can also be ap-
plied to sports.

For the past ﬁve years, this department has tried to in-
terest the student body in the presentation of the annual Pitt
athletic awards in the form of ﬁrst, Varsity Day, and then,
last year, as part of Tap Day.

Neither of the two clicked. So, this semester, the
department has decided that the All-sports banquet,
which all the lettermen of the various sports attend, will
be the scene.

It seems that only the athletes care "about honoring their
teammates for their successes as well asdownfalls but the
students only make noise when Notre Dame is defeated.

Varsity Day and Varsity Walk were originated by the
Panther Club in 1950. The purpose of the Day was to com-
memorate the giving of the Charles C. Hartwig,,the Ath-
letic Committee, and the Special Academic Achievement
awards plus the disclosing_of the letter-winners in each
sport.

The names of the Hartwig and Committee awardees
were to be inscribed on Varsity Walk, the
ODK Walk that leads to Heinz Chapel.
still carried on.

Varsity Day, however, left the campus in 1954 since
attendance at the ceremonies was relatively sparse—onIy
the athletes were present. _ _

Last spring, then, the athletic awards were added to
Tap Day going-ons. But satisfaction wasn’t to be found here
either as the honors received no individuality, were thrown
in with the rest of the many student activities, and interest
Wasn’t any higher than before.

Thus, it comes about that Field House oﬁicials felt that
these awards would -be most appreciated by the players
themselves.’ The presentations will be inaugurated as part
of the All-sports banquet May 2 and it ‘looks to be their
permanent home. I

No, one needn’t worry about a tradition falling because
Varsity Day hardly lasted long enough to be so called, but
this certainly doesn’t help close the gap between the Com-
mons Room ballplayer and the rest of the school.

Thinclads
By STEVE BUTCHOCKA
A, Highly pleased with ‘the 63-59

conquest of the Miami Redskins

last weekend, Coach Carl Olson’s
thinclads will be running in the
Ohio Relays at Columbus Friday
and Saturday.

The Panther mile relay team,
consisting of Joe Dudas, Chuck
Fritz, Bill Green, and Arnie So-
well, set a new Miami Field rec-
ord,of 3119.6 which was previously
held by Ohio State as they snap-
ped the Ohioans’ 22 dual meet
winstring. In addition, Tom Jones
of the host school set a new record
in the shotput and discus.

Arnie Sowell continued his
amazing track feats as he ran the
mile with .a winning time of, 4:l6.2,
ﬁnished ﬁrst in the broad jump
with a leap of 23 feet 3/4 inches,
and once again was an easy victor
in his specialty—the 880 yard run
--with a mark of 1:56.9. '

The Jungle Cats captured all
three places in the 440 with Bill
Green ﬁrst in 49.6, followed by Ed
Saunders, and Dudas. Dave Peays
won the 220, in 22.8, Allan Gunder—
son took the two—mile event in
9:35.5, and Bill Kulnis and Bill
Smith tied for the top spot in the
pole vault with a vault of 13 feet
3 inches.

The weakest spot for the Olson-
men has been the hurdles where
they were able to take only/ one
of the six place positions against
the Redskins, that being second
place in the 220-yard low hurdles
by Saunders.

In view of the increased com-
petition that the locals will face
in the relays, the Panther track
mentor will probably enger his
mile relay team—which has been
"nothing short of sensational this
tseason——since he doesn’t want to
place entries in the events which
he ﬁgures will not yield the locals
any points. And as usual, Sowell
‘will be one of the feature attrac-
‘tions in the events in which he
competes.
