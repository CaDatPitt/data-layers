Pitt philosophy lecturer dies  

Michael Macagnone & Olivia Garber
‘ News Staﬁ’

Pitt lecturer Michael “Mickey” Perloff died of
natural causes last Friday. He was in his early
70s. 1

As a lecturer and assistant chair of the phi-
losophy department, Perloff taught classes such
as Introductionto Logic and Introduction to
Philosophical Problems. He also served as the
department’s adviser for undergraduate stu-
dents. P

Mark Wilson, chair of the philosophy depart-

ment, saidthat Perloffwas “an incredibleﬁxture ‘

in the University.” '

In addition to advising undergraduates, Per-
loff also served as the adviser of the philosophy
club. 4 ’ .

Perloff was always accessible to students.
He kept all of his office hours and responded

immediately to e—mai]s, Wilson said.

Senior David" DeLorenzo, a political science
major, experienced Perloff’s generosityﬁrsthand.
When DeLorenzowastryingto make sense of all
the credits necessaiyto graduate, Perloffwas
theretohelp. V

“I wasn’t even his student, technically,-’,’ De-
Lorenzo said. ‘ -

Althotigli he had taken Perloff’s logic class
morethanayearbefore, Perloff still remembered
DeLorenzo’s name. . 1

DeLorenzo said Perloff made logic “bear-
able.”

Logic normallyuses “P”s an “Q”s, but Perloff
did not limit himself to the alphabet, often using
“crazy” examples, DeLorenzo said.

“He’d make up somethingstupid, keep it non
sequiuitg” DeLorenzo said.

ButPerloffoftenwentbeyond the naditional
responsibilities ofprofessorship —— Wilson said
thatlastyearPerloﬁ' threwapaity for graduating

seniors in the philosophy department.

Describedasa“veiy sweet and gentle man”by
Wilson, Perloff was also essential to the success
of the philosophy department;

Wilson said he served as a type of liaison
between the department and the university,
often running the more practical aspects of the
department. _

“He solved all of our problems for us,” Wil-
son said.

Wilson will take over Perloff’s class for the
remainder oftlie-semester. He said that Perloff’s
classes for spring semester have already been
taken by other professors.

Perloff earned his doctorate of philosophy
with a specialty in logic from Pitt in 1974 and
has published research on the logical working
of agents.

Perloff will be buried in Florida, and the phi-
losophy department is planninga memorial for
January or February. ' 

Pitt, WVU
set for
103rd Brawl

Roger Sepich
For The Pitt News

It’s hard to imagine a 6-4 football team
playing in a bigger game than Pitt will this
Friday at noon. '

That’s because the Panthers will host
rival West Virginia in the 103"‘ edition of
the annual game known as The Backyard
Brawl, a game in which there is far more at
stake than just bragging rights.

The Mountaineers (7-3, 3-2) are already
Pitt’s ﬁercest rival. Throw in some mas-
sive Big East Championship and BCS bowl

implications, Pitt’s senior day, some ﬂashy ’

new Nike Pro Combat uniforms for both
teams and a national television audience,
and you’ve got the formula for one incred-

. ibly important football game.

“I love to play in games likes this,”said

. senior defensive endjabaal Sheard, one of

the 11 seniors who will be acknowledged
before their ﬁnal home game. “This is the
game of the year for Pitt football.”

“This is the best game of the year,”
fellow senior and offensive tackle Jason
Pinkston said. “It’s West Virginia. There’s
nothing better.”

The Panthers, who are 4-1 in Big East
play following a hard—fought 17-10 victory
at South Florida this past weekend, have a
one—game conference lead and still control
their own destiny, but they can?t afford a

" slip up against the Mountaineers or next

week against Cincinnati.

“If we want to win the Big East Cham-
pionship, we’ve got “to win these next
two games, and we know that,” Pinkston
said. ~ ‘

With two weeks of football to play, the
Big East title race has narrowed itself to a

Freshman balances engineering, composing

Emily Riley
Stajf Writer

Calloused fingertips glided across the
frets ofa Fender Stratocaster. Thejazz
melody floated around the tiny practice
room.

“It is a stress reliever.Jazz is the most
relaxing to play. Ijust feel it.”

The guitarist was Jacob Sacks, a Pitt
freshman with a musical mind and huge
ambition. Earlier this month, the en-

gineering student won the BNY Mel-

lonJazz Scholarship, an annual $5,000
award that goes toward the price of ei-
ther tuition or room and board at Pitt.

Established in 1986 by Nathan Davis,
the director and founder of the Jazz
Studies program at Pitt, the scholarship
collaborates the expertise of several
established musicians who choose the
most deserving candidate.

The contest only receives about 15
applications each year, Davis said, but
“withjudges like Rufus Reid and David
Baker, the award deserves prestigious
recognition.”

Both of those musicians’ received
various jazz awards of their own. Baker
received an Emmy for his work on a PBS
documentary “For Gold & Glory,” and
Reid was awarded the 2005 Mellonjazz
Living Legacy Award for his lifelong
commitment to jazz by the Mid Atlantic
Arts Foundation.

The jazz scholarship was an after-
thought to Sacks, who said that he
was extremely surprised to hear of his
award.

“One of my music teachers told me
about it, so I got some samples together
and sent them in,” Sacks said. “I actually
kinda forgot I had submitted anything.

' W 9‘ Jul 1 1

Although he only picked up his first
guitar about five years ago, Sacks has
had more than a decade of experience
with string instruments. He credited
much of his ability to the extensive
hours spent playing the violin for eight
years before starting on the guitar.

In addition, his 1ong—termjazz guitar
instructor R.J. Zimmerman, a professor
at Duquesne University, taught Sacks
most of what he knows of the theory
and fundamentals ofjazz music.

Zimmerman said, “I have been teach-
ingjazz guitar for about 20 years now,
andjacob is definitely the most talented
student I have ever taught.”

Sacks is continuing his formal educa-_
tion through Pitt’s music department.
Because of the engineering major’s
heavy course load, he is only able to
take one elective class per semester,
which includes music classes.

This semester, he is enrolled in Music.

Sacks uses rock sound  

_]azz<2

as a composer ﬁrst, performer second.
Sacks tries to combine various genres in
order to produce an original piece.

“I would say my style is jazz with a
rock sound and a classical structure,”
Sacks said.

This interpretation stems from his
love of all music types as well as the
inspiration of his current guitar—play-
ing idols. He alluded to the styles of
Grammy-winning guitarist Steve Vai,
who Sacks said “phrases things beauti-
fully,” and jazz guitarist Pat Martino,

. who plays with a “spiritual yet intel-

lectual” style.

Despite his lovefor music, Sacks
prefers to pursue a multifaceted career
including, research in the engineering
field.  S A‘ - A

“What I would reallylove to do is
work in a lab by day and kick around
the clubs by night,” Sacks said. “I want

to be able to include both passions in

Sacks came to Pitt for the tuition
beneﬁts that come with having a parent

working for the University, but also for L

the engineering program.

Sacks’ father, Michael Sacks, works
at the McGowan Institute for Regen-
erative Medicine on campus, while his
mother, Ruth, works as a music com-
poser. . ' ‘

Besides his dedication to academics

V and music, Sacks finds" the time to hang

out and kick it at the honors dorm on
Forbes Avenue.

“He isjust a fun person to be around.
A genuinely nice individual with an im-
pressive dedication to his work,” said
Sacks’ friend and fellow freshman Alex
Sieman. “If he wants something, if it is
a future in music, he will get it.” Q

EDITORIAL

The pardoning of

tu rkeys I

Turkeys are notoriously evil.

In fact, they commit crimes so heinous
that 50 million of them are given the death
penalty every year, right around the third
Thursday of November.

But some turkeys are more equal than
others.

Since 1989, the president has pardoned
one of those turkey terrorists each year.

Well,'technically two are pardoned, in
case one is unable to make all of its televi-
sion appearances. . ' '

~ We’re not really sure what these lucky
few birds have done to get pardons while
the other 50 million are left to roast — or
‘what crimes they committed to require
pardoning to begin with. p
_ As it turns out, the turkey that will re-
ceive pardon this year began his life of
crime when he gobbled racial slurs against
chickens,

He was also caught indecently expos-
ing his wattle to important government
officials outside of the White House.

B_ut his story doesn’t end there.

This bad bird is also known for stealing
from Saks Fifth Avenue and committing so-

_ cial faux pas like”interrupting Taylor Swift
at the Video Music Awards in 2009.
' The turkey reportedly received multiple
F.U.I.s after ﬂying under the inﬂuence of
‘ Wild Turkey.

During his court hearings, the judge
tried to make him go to rehab and he said,
“No, no, no!” ' '

So why does this turkey escape the
chopping block?.

We hypothesize that Obama chose to
pardon this particular bird after the turkey

agreed to go to rehab and do a year’s worth
of community service —- mentoring young
poultry. - '

Confused? So were we. Every year, the
president pardons two turkeys around
Thanksgiving. But why? What coul_d the
turkey have possibly done wrong?

It turns out the annual turkey pardoning
dates back to the first Turkey Day of George
H.W. Bush’s presidency, in 1989. Accord-

" ing to the Washington Post, Bush said of

the fowl, “He will not end up on anyone’s
dinner table — not this guy. He’s granted
a presidential'pardon as of right now.”

We’re sad to say that the joke hasn’t
evolved much since then.

After pardoning a bird named Courage
last year, President Barack Obama said,
“There are certain days that remind me of
why I ran for this office. And then there are
moments like this where I pardon a turkey
and send it to Disneyland,” according to
the Information Please Database.

And in 2007, The Washington Post
reported that President George W. Bush
“promised May the turkey that he would not
be served with a side of yams on Thanksgiv-

ing. Nor would May’s pal Flower.”

He joked that these names were better

than the ones the vice president suggested

—— “Lunch” and “Dinner.”

We hope we’ve helped you make sense

of the tradition of the presidential pardon-
ing of a turkey. . .
‘ If we haven’t convinced you that all tur-
keys are crazy when set loose, perhaps you
can enjoy Tofurky for dinner on Thursday
instead.

Happy Thanksgiving. I

International expectations

Not everyone will get a French boyfriend when they study abroad

Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

Many students might like to imagine hot
Swedish babes eagerly awaiting in the
light of warm sunsets over the Strait of
Sicily while holding a glass of Marsala as
a gorgeous Italian man serenades from
nearby. '

Others, perhaps of a more intellectual
bent, might fancy meeting an old Irish
folklorist while biking past weathered
mountains.

Whichever way, be it in a cultural, social

abroad opportunities.

Whether such ideas are inﬂuenced by
history classes, movies —- I can’t help but
name “Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo” as
the big culprit here —— or other students,
international life just seems exciting.

And as a new group is readying to leave
Pitt for next semester, I can’t help but no-
tice the expectations are as high as ever.

Going abroad not magic pill

Stamatakis ( 5

Chunnel it to Trafalgar Square" with my
new French boyfriend and take pictures
in the fountain and then I will stumble
upon a sophisticated, down-to-earth, real
indie—rock club.”

Perhaps exaggerated a bit, it nonethe-
less reﬂects the swirling land of romance,
languages, accents and fine’ cooking that
seems to exist everywhere but here. Drab
Pittsburgh just has rain and fun—sucking
machines. . -

After all, other places aren’t as one-
dimensional, corporate, fat or greasy as
America. Other places are just so much
cooler. '_ ‘ S ’

Pure psychology creates excitement for studying abroad

all.

Aroundthe world, students just want
something different — the expectation of
a different atmosphere. ‘

According to a paper by Jens Forster
in thejournal of Experimental Social Psy-
chology, “ian order to prepare for novel
events,” people think more abstractly and
with greater self—clarity.

Pure psychology is what creates the
excitement of study abroad. It focuses our
energies’, sets expectations and allows our
imaginations to run wild.»

This leaves _us' with two ultimate con-
clusions: First, buying into psychological

 

But before everybody leaving packs
beanie caps and kazoos in excitement,
realize that what you are looking for might
not be uniquely European, or Latin Ameri-
can or Australian. . i 2

Going abroad is not a magiéipill that
just suddenly makes your life interesting.
After all, if that were the case, there would
be no reason anybody would come to the
United States. ‘ V

Butpeople do want to come to the.

United States to study. As noted in an ar-
ticle in The Sunday Times of London there
is more than one British young woman
who ﬁnds “the brash Abercrombie-and-
Fitch—wearing American hunks alluring.”
I thought Italian men were supposed to be

' the alluring ones.

And one description of an Australian

V program that sends high school kids to the

United States raves, “The school experi-
ence in the U.S. is unique —— students are
encouraged to engage with their school
community, which is a very social and fun
atmosphere.” The trip, offered by World
Education Program Australia, even prom-
ises participants will experience “one of
the most anticipated events for American

. teenagers — the Prom.”

So people from the rest of the world

come to America because it, too, is seen .

as an exciting, alluring place.
This reveals a dirty little truth about
study abroad — it isn’t where you are

.. going, but the fact that you are going at

expectations that are unrealistic might
make you complacent. Being someplace
different won’t magically make you dif-
ferent, after all. If you just- assume that
being in France will get you a hot French

boyfriend," you might be less inclined to I

actually do the legwork required to get a

hot French boyfriend. - . .
Secondly, to those of us stuck in'Amer-

ic_a, be comfortedthat much of the ex-

, citementand intrigue of study abroad is
' purely psychological.

If all you can muster is a summer trip
to Tennessee, but you can convince your-
self it is novel and that you will get a hot
Tennessean boyfriend, then you too will
be able to experience some of the excite-
ment.

Change your routine —— don’t be con-
ﬁned by the fact you are “stuck” in the
same place. '

Ultimately, wherever you go, you are
still you. '

Germany will not make you cooler, and
Minnesota will not make you lamer. It
might make you think you are different,
and it might even make you act differently,
but just have a sense of realism when you
think about either staying or leaving.

So instead of an Italian in Sicily, maybe
drinking whiskey overlooking the Shenan-
doah Valley with a Kentuckian playing the
banjo can be enough to spur an exciting
summer or semester. ‘

Band relishes ‘Allstar’ status

Backstreet Boys fans, take note: Allstar
Weekend has invented a new twist on

A the youth-rock formula.

Less of a boy band than many of
its predecessors, Allstar Weekend is
nevertheless unafraid to embrace the
“pop-rock” genre, labeling its sound a

: cross between blink—18-2 and the Jonas

Brothers.

“Obviously we’re pop rock, and with a
dance influence. But when we perform,
we are trying to have more of a classic-
rock feel but still with some dance influ-
ence,” lead vocalist Zach Porter said.

A fixture on Radio Disney, it’s no
wonder Allstar Weekend is gaining some
notoriety with the under-20 crowd.
Formed while its members were stillin
high school, the band has become well-
known for its energy and for exploring
youth-oriented themes — among them,

“taking advantage of life while you still

have the chance. ' .

“We are in that young demographic.
When we started we were still in high
school. As we grow it will change, but
we’re always writing about what we
know, just being realﬁ’ Porter said.

. Courtesy J oshua Bakaitus
The members of Allstar Weekend (above) are enjoying their newfound appeal and not worrying too much about the future.

These “real” lyrics can pertain to
anything the boys feel strongly about,

be it family and friends, the touring

experience or living out their dreams
of becoming musicians.

“It totally varies, there’s no speciﬁc
formula. We just jam it out, because it’s
really all about feeling,” Porter said of
songwriting. “Songs like ‘A Different
Side of Me’ are about how we are living
that dream. It’s about how three‘ years
ago, we were thinking about being on
tour, you know, saying we wanted to be
rock stars.”

For now, the boys will continue writ?

ing what they know. Usually, that means
experiences most young adults can re-
late to. '

Times might change, powers might shiit, but as

the play “Talley’s Folly” demonstrates, romance _

never falls out of fashion.

Set during World War II, “Talley’s Folly” is
a romantic comedy that chronicles the story
of two misﬁts, Sally Talley and Matt Friedman,
who meet in a Victorian boathouse in Missouri
in1944. Although the riveris farfrom any battle-
ﬁelds, both Matt and Sally must overcome their
own differences before they can consider being
together.

Director Pamela Berlin has worked with the

Pittsburgh Public Theater four times in the pasf. ‘

As a fan of playwright Lanford Wilson, she was
interested in directing “Talley’s Folly” from the
beginning.

“This play is a wonderful character study,”
Berlin said. “It’s a two—character play with two
people who on the surface seem so different. It’s
aclash of cultures, and yet they are drawn to each
other. But there arevhuge obstacles keepingthem
apart, and that’s what the play is about. And it’s
not plot—driven, it’s relationship-driven.”

Berlin believes the play offers a singularly
compelling frame. “The setting is wonderful,”

she said of the boathouse. “You feel as if you’re‘

right there. And it takes place at once. It takes
place in real time in one scene.”

Julie Fitzpatrick, the actress who plays Sally
Talley, said the humor in the show is one of its
strongest points. “The playwrightis silly at times

and incredibly intelligent,” she said. “The writing

is just great. The banter between these two char-
acters really draws me in. It is called a romantic
comedy, and it has ‘a tremendous amount of ro-
mance, but it’s also reallya grounded play. These
two peopletrytoﬁnd theirwayto each other, and

they go through a heck of a lot. It has a large—scale)

experience between the people.”

FitzpatIick’s character is “complicated” and
makes for a challenging role.

“Sally is —— like we all are — a huge bag of
contradict1'ons,” Fitzpatrick said. “There is love
there, but there is a huge obstacle. My challenge is
tohonorthe love soIdon’t constantly p1ayanob4'

in Sally, since there are no many ‘no’s throughout
the show. I ﬁnd her humor and rhythms. And I

ilaretotake the time the playwrighttooktoletthe

story unfold. You trust the unfolding process.”

Each person involved with the show has
worked hard to produce it. Berlin began re-
searching the play months in advance, hoping
this foresight would help her adequately manage
the entire production.

“I have to familiarize myself with the play,
what it’s about, who the characters are, and I
have to cast the characters well,” Berlin said. “The
success of the play hinges on the actors. Then I
work with a set designer and costume designer
and lighting designer.”

" Since rehearsals began, the technical crew,

the director and actor Andrew Polk, who plays

_ Matt Friedman, have done a “tremendous” job

in Fitzpatri_ck’s eyes. “Pam is bringing out the
story in a unique way,” Fitzpatrick added. “I feel
so lucky with this team I have.”

Bringingthe show to audiences is the exciting
and rewardingpart of the job forboth Berlin and
Fitzpatrick. And even if the setting isn’t contem-
porary, the story might as well be in their eyes.

“It’s speciﬁc to a time and place, and yet it
resonates tremen ‘ously with the here and now,”

Porter said the band members are
inspired by “things that happen to us

— basically our lives now. But really, 90.

percent of it is about our fans.”

Guitarist Nathan Darmody‘ affirmed

this dedication to the audience.

“It’s cool to see what fans bring out
for us [at concerts]. We’re so far from
home, butto still see people who like us
+— we love it,” he said. -

While the boys are always considering
a serious career inmusic, they admit
that it isn’t their number one priority.
For now they plan on enjoying their
place in the industry while it lasts.

“Honestly,’we have no idea what we’ll
be doing in the future. About a year ago
we played a. show in Chicago for a parade
and no one knew us. Looking back at
that, we would have neveriguessed how
much would change,” Darmody said. ,_,

Directed by: Edward Zwick

Grade: C+ A V ; L

If anything. positive can be said of"‘L_ove and

but mostly just cry hysterically.  _ ' ,

At ﬁrst glance, this latest rom-com has all
the necessary ingredients to provoke your tear
ducts, including an emotionally scarred girl
(Maggie, played by Anne Hathaway), caught in
the midst of a quarter-life crisis; her eventual

Maggie’s battle with early—onset Parkinson’s

Sound familiar? If you think you’ve seen
this movie before, it’s probably because you

Remember, for instance, the Keanu Reeves

If not, surely you haven’t forgotten Shane West
and Mandy Moore’s tear-jerker, “A Walk to ‘
Remember.” Although the characters in each ,
ﬁlm have their own quirky traits -4 whether

‘ it’s an unfaltering dedication to Jesus Christ

or a seriously eccentric lifestyle — the main
premise is close to identical.

If you’ve seen either of those movies, save
yourselfthe 10 bucks you’d spend on “Love
and Other Drugs” and curl up with a good
Nicholas Sparks novel‘-— the effect will be‘

’ justthe same. _ _ M -
Fellow moviegoers, I implore you: don’t al- ~-

low Gyllenhaal’s taut abs and perfectly sculpted
rear to lure you into a false sense of movie
security. If you do the right thing and heed my
advice, you’ll wait to see the ﬁlm_on Netﬂix.
That way, you can watch it from the comfort
of your own Mac, on mute-— you’ll get plenty

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Panthers set to face off with city rival

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staﬁ" Writer

While the Pitt men’s basketball team was

Madison Square Garden, Robert Morris
was occupied'as well, defeating Duquesne
for the first time since 2006.

Today, the Panthers will look to avoid
becoming the second Pittsburgh bas-
ketball team to fall to sophomore guard
Karon Abraham and the Colonials.

Abraham scored 15 points in the 69-63
win over the Dukes, guiding Robert Mor-
ris to victory despite Duquesne jumping
out to an early 23-10 lead. He went 4-for-4
at the foul line during a 12-5 Colonials run

He leads the Colonials in scoring this
season with 14 points per game. Forward
Russell Johnson nearly averaged a dou-
ble-double, putting up 12.3 points and
pulling down eight rebounds per game.

Last season, Abraham was the unani-
mous Northeast Conference Rookie of
the Year selection and ‘set seven Robert
Morris freshman records. An aggressive
player and a talented scorer, he hasn’t
missed a step in his sophomore cam-
paign.

Whereas Abraham shines in the back-
court, Johnson is a stand-out forward
who played in all 35 games last season.-
He’s active inside and a versatile athlete,
able to step out and hit mid-rangejump—

Both Robert Morris and Pitt received
important contributions from the bench
in their latest victories. The Colonials’
reserves outscored Duquesne’s bench‘22—
8, with freshman Anthony Myers scoring
seven points and grabbing eight rebounds
and seven different players scoring at
least six points.

In the 79-70 win over Maryland, the
Pitt bench scored 30 points, led by an
11-point and _five-assist performance
from Travon Woodall. The bench put up
2.0 points against Texas.

The Panthers showed their versatility
in theirwins in New York. In the Vic-
tory over Maryland, five different play-
ers scored in double figures, and Dante
Taylor was close with eight points.

Talib Zanna ended with a double-dou-
ble against the Terrapins, putting up 14
points and grabbing 12 rebounds. Not
only will Robert Morris have to contend
with the backcourt combination ofAsh—

three horse race: Pitt, West Virginia and Con-
necticut.

Because of the head—to~head tie—breaker rule
and Pitt’s previous loss at Connecticut, a loss to

win would put them on the brink of a title, with

a chance to avenge last season’s heartbreaking

loss to Cincinnati and clinch the Big East in their
. ﬁnal game.

Since the turn of the millennium, Backyard
Brawls have been fill] of incredible moments.
From Tyler Palko’s leap over Adam “Pacman”

Jones in 2004 and Darrelle Revis’ sensational
punt retum in 2006, to the memorable 13-9
Pitt victory in 2007 that denied West Virginia
a National Championship game berth and last
year’s last-second game—winning ﬁeld-goal in
WVU’s 19-16 win. ’

The past decade of Brawls, which is split with
each team winning ﬁve, has featured games
which, if anything, have taught Pitt and WVU
fans alike to expect the unexpected.

This year’s game, which features a matchup
of two of the nation’s most feared rushing at-
tacks, should be no different. Mountaineer quar-
terback Geno Smith and veteran running back
Noel Devine lead their speedy spread-option
ground game, and Dion Lewis and Ray Graham
pace the Panthers’ power running game.

Devine is ﬁfth in the Big East in rushingwith
828 yards and has the quickness to break offa
long run at any time.

Both Sheard and Pinkston know this game
could be won or lost in the muddy trenches of

'Heinz Field.

“[Smith and Devine] are just so fast and tal-
ented,” Sheard said. “But if we can control theni
I feel like we should win the game.”

“If we’ve got to run the ball 80 times to get
the win, that’s what we’re going to do,” Pinkston
said.

As is typical in a duel between two rushing-
heavy teams, Pitt head coach Dave Wannstedg.
expects a close, grind-it-out game that will be
decided by special teams, turnovers and pen-
alties.

“Itwill probably come down to the team that
doesn’t make the biggest plays, but the team that
makes the fewest amount ofbad plays,” he said.
“That falls into tumovers and obviously penal?‘
ties. The kicking game will be a major factor
too, but I have all the conﬁdence in the world

tonGibbs and Brad Wanamaker, but the
emergence of Zanna gives ‘the Colonials
someone else to worry about inside.

“He plays with energy. That’s his job
— to give his team a greatioffensive re-
bounder that can do all the dirty work
that most guys don’t want to do,” Mary-
land head coach Gary Williams said.

But in the matchup with Texas, Pitt
needed a strong performance from lead-
ing scorer Gibbs, who made several clutch
shoots en route to scoring 24 points, 19
of which came in the second half. The
Panthers won 68-66.

The Panthers pulled off the close vic- -

tory because of their ability to make good
decisions, especially at the end of the
game, Pitt head coachjamie Dixon said.
Their discipline and experience makes it
difficult for any team, including Robert
Morris, to rattle them.

“You have to have patience and rec-
ognize that we are not going to get a

about the process, about the grind, the
patience and the commitment to what
we are doing.”

Dixon said Pitt’s success stems from
the players’ ability to come together as
a team, putting their egos aside in order
to continue winning.

‘.‘ [The players] are proud to be at the
University of Pittsburgh, and they [are]
playing for the name on their front jer-
sey. I think that is important,” he said.
“Character iswhat you look for and when
you get high-character kids, you can do
a lot of great things.”

So far this this seson, Robert Mor-
ris has scored an average 61 points per
game, holding opponents to 51.7 points,
while Pitt has put up 84.4 points and
limited opponents to 62.8.

The Panthers have also been out-re-
bounding most of their opponents, an
issue the Colonials are going to have to
contend with if they want a chance a
defeating the Panthers. [ m i p  7
