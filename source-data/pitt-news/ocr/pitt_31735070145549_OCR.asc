Pitt underclassmen faced upperclassmen in what was perhaps the largest snowball ﬁght in the school’s history. The contest turned into a capture-the-ﬂag—sty1e struggle to
. maintain control of a chair, which was clearly not designed for such shenanigans.

Hundreds of people gathered on the
Cathedral lawn yesterday, Super Bowl
Sunday. There was chaos, chanting
and merrirnent, even as gatherers
dodged projectiles.

No, this was not a riot — it took
place before the Super Bowl. The pro-

jectiles were snowballs.

Alter a historic snowfall ham-
mered the city this weekend, Pitt
student Andrew Max created a Face-
book event called, “Pre superbowl Pitt
SNOWBALL FIG .” at 5 a.rn. Satur-
day and invited 200 people.

“When I went to bed, four people
were conﬁrm ,” Max said. “When I
woke up, there were 500 people.”

About 200 people attended the
event, but about 50 of those attendees

watched from a safe distance.

At 2:30 p.m. Alan Haman made
hisway to the Cathedral lawn. Hewas
the first one to arrive, but there were
already two forts made, one along
the sidewalk in the center of the lawn
between the Cathedral and Heinz
Chapel, and another in front of Heinz
Chapel.

Haman arrived early to make

snowballs, but the snow was dry and _

packing‘ itwas difficult.

“I haven’t made any good ones
yet,” he said. - .

The fort by Heinz Chapel was
furnished with a small beige chair.
The underclassmen team gathered
around the chair, and the upperclass-
mentookthe otherfort.

Shortly before 3 p.m. someone
launched a small snowball from the
underclassmen side. It hit an upper-

classman, and the underclassmen
cheered.

“Charge!” someone shouted.

The two sides ran toward each
other through the 1<nee—deep snow,
tossing snowballs at anyone 
range.

Many snowballs turned into dust
in rnid-air, so, people improvised.
Alter hundreds of people walked on
the snow, it started to solidify, and
the snowball ﬁghters picked up large
chunks and tossed them on top of

people. Some people kicked and

scoopedthe snowto spray others.
The sides retreated to g'cn:her,more
snow to throw. They soon charged

again, andthen retreated. They re-V

peatedthispatternfor nearlyanhour.

All the while, the improvisation be-

came more and more creative.
Therewas ayellow shovel with the

- name Mike Dayak written on it, but

nobody seemed to know who Mike
Dayak was, and the shovel ended up in
many people’s hands.

“You got to get the shovel,” Mi-
chael Israel, a snowball ﬁghter on the
underclassmen side, said. “Everyone
goes after you, but you can get every-
one.” .

As Israel said this, Max got hold
of the shovel He scooped up snow on
the upperclassmen side, ran across
and dumped it on several underclass-
men. _‘

Shortly after this, two people, col-
lided in the center and fell down.
They began to wrestle and both sides
charged .

There was a chaotic attempt to

bury the two people in snow, and

snow ﬂew everywhere, like a cartoon-.
style dust cloud. Once the snow dust

cleared, the two people who originally
fell had disappeared amid the mad-
tress.

Pitt students Kim Payne and Bon-
nie La carried a small, plastic garbage
bin full of snow toward the front line
of the upperclassmen. c

“We just found it sitting there so

i we ﬁlled it up,” Payne said. “We call it

conspicuous trash  CI‘.’’ p A
" The two young women carried

“ CI‘ to the center- during a charge and

dumped its entirety onto one unfortu-
nate underclassman.
Suddenly, the upperclassmen

C-charged through the underclassmen

and grabbed the chair to bringit over
to their own side. Pitt student Stepha-
nie Mehalic sat in the chair, and the
upperclassmen celebrated. . 3

time off.

Rich Redmond, a National Weather Service
meteorologist, predicted that another storm will
begin tomorrow morning and continue through
Wednesday night. Hethinksthe stormwill dump
another 3 to 6 inches of snow on the city but said
those numbers could change because the storm
is still far away.

Much of the snow from this weekend’s storm
remains on the ground Forbes and Fifth avenues
in Oakland are still almost completely covered

with snow, making 'Duesday’s storm more dan-
gerous.

“It will compact the snow underneath it and
make it almost like ice,” he said.

“When you have a storm like this in March,
you know spring is coming fast,” he said, “but
when you have a storm like this injanuary or Feb-
ruary, and you’re right in the winter, it adds up to
a lot of problems.”

The county and the state remained in a disas-
ter emergency last night.

The Port Authority expected to have more
than 100 of its about 160 routes operating today.
Port Authority spokesmanjim Ritchie said that
there might be more buses added throughout
the day. -

The PortAuthority instructed all its drivers to
pull off the road Friday night, when the roads be-
ganto get icy. The PortAuthorityhasbeen slowly
restoring service since then.

   

“We know right off the bat that it’s goingto be
slow going [today],” said Ritchie. Buses will have
delays “and that’s going to have a domino effect
throughout the day,” he said.

Riders who can’t get to their bus stop because
of the snow should “ﬂag” bus drivers by waving,
the Port Authority website said.

Nearly 80,000 people throughout the coun-
ty lost power duringthis weekend’s storm, and as
of last night about 24,000 of them had yet to get
it back. Saturday, county residents were asked to
avoid showering, washing their dishes, drinking
sink water or ﬂushing their toilets after a water
treatment plant lost power. The plant is running

County oﬂicials asked people to avoid driv-
ing so public works crews, power companies;
police and ﬁreﬁghters canwork. Only “essen ' ”
county ofﬁces, such as the forensic examiner’s
office and the county jail, will be open today,
Kevin Evanto, county spokesman, said in a news
release.

Redmond, the meteorologist, said Pitt stu-
dents and staff should get used to the delays and
icy roads, because the temperature will stay low
through thisvweek and the next. ’

“That snow that’s on the ground is going
behere for quite awhile,’_’ he said. ‘

Snowballers vie for chair

Snowball ﬁght 4 2

Several young men lifted the chair, with Me-
halic, into the air. They carried her toward the
other side as she tossed snowballs at the under-
classmen.

This marked the point where the snowball
ﬁght turned into a ‘capture the chair’ battle, and
snow became simply ammunition.

Both sides captured the chair several times,
and it often involved a tug of war. The chair some-
how remained intact.

- The snowball ﬁghters raised their hands in
the air as a handful of people took photos from
the lawn.

“U-S-A! U-S—A!” they shouted.

After the upperclassmen had recaptured the
chair — and the shovel —— Nicholas Bazzell sat
in it and was lifted into the air, waving the shovel
in celebration. Upperclassmen carried Bazzell,
who is not a student and was just ﬁghting for
whichever side he was on, toward the Cathedral.

The upperclassmen thought they had won,
but the underclassmen charged toward the Ca-
thedral. C] Johnson, a Pitt freshman, sat on the
chairwith Bazzell. ’ .

Instead of ﬁghting over it once more, the two
young men shouted “Unity!”

Both sides banded together to lift up the chair
in which both Bazzell and Johnson were sitﬁng.
They attempted to carry it up to the ﬂagpole, but
Bazzell andjohnson soon fell to the ground.

“We can do this,” someone shouted.

Some students carried the chair to the ﬂag-
pole, as Bazzell andjohnson lifted into the air. All
the other participants decided to gather around

pletely packed down, and people who walked on
it no longer sunk into it.

Snow woes

riday hosted the begin-

ning of the region’s fourth

worst snowstorm in re-
corded history, which ended at
noon, Saturday. In less than 24
hours, enough snowﬂakes fell to
cost the city what will probably
be a week of hindered services
and troubled transportation.
The fall totaled 21.1 inches.

City services are not operat-
ing as normal.

Allegheny County, and the
whole of Pennsylvania are still
in a state of emergency. Penn-
sylvania American Water, a
water treatment plant that lost
power Saturday, only lifted its
mandatory water conservation
order to customers yesterday.
Additionally, Allegheny County
announced more than 45,000
customers are without_ power
as of Sunday. Port Authority
resumed service, although it is
still limited and not on a strict
schedule.

A brief look around Oakland I

and it is obvious that getting to
and from class will be difficult
for students, faculty and staff.

With dropping temperatures, .

ice becomes another safety
concern. And it is not over yet.
The National Weather Service
issued a Winter Storm Watch
for Tuesday and Wednesday.

But the trek will be even
more difficult for the many stu-
dents, faculty and staff mem-
bers who live outside Oakland.
With many roads still unplowed
and buses running infrequently,
the Monday pilgrimage will be
both inconvenient and danger-
ous.

Pitt should be open to can-
celing class not only today, but

 

every day until conditions be-
come safe and practical for the
University to operate.

Historically, Pitt rarely can-
cels class due to weather, oper-
ating four years since the last
cancellation. Sometimes night
classes are canceled, and some-
times weekend classes are, like
Saturday’s classes were. Last
Friday’s classes should have
been canceled, or at least cut
short a little early so people
were not stranded on campus.

Libraries and computer labs
closed by noon on Saturday for
specific reasons. Conditions
have barely changed and such
reasons" would logically hold
true for the rest of the week un-
til the snow is cleared enough
for campus activity to contin-
ue.

Currently, Forbes and Fifth
avenues are still blanketed with
snow, hardened by those few
braving the weather to reach
their destinations. Few side-
walks are clear, and even these
sidewalks were not so until
the storm ended, so they are
still difficult to use; at least
the purple salt is pretty. Doing
anything on campus proves to
be a challenge, but the smaller
streets farther from campus are
even worse.

Canceling class for just one
day does not mean much. If the
roads and sidewalks are still the
same on Thursday, given Tues-
day’s and Wednesday’s forecast,
there is still no reason to keep
the University open.

Doing so would create major
academic and financial incon-
venience, but safety needs to be
Pitt’s top priority.

The danger of emotions

 
   

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

Medical ﬁndings can affect mil-
lions of people overnight and
provide real results that can
push back some of the worst dis-
eases —— such as acute death syn-
drome — and make our longer
lives more livable. But what hap-
pens when a study neatly divides
people into ‘two camps, with
each side accusing the other of
endangering children?
According to Time Magazine, a
General Medical Council, a UK
government panel that registers
doctors and protects patients,
has found that Dr. Andrew J.
Wakeﬁeld, lead author of a con-
troversial study published in
The Lancet in 1998, violated
numerous ethical procedures
in conducting his research, and
ruled that he acted “dishonestly
and irresponsibly”. The study
in question supposedly showed
a ‘link between the measles,
mumps, and rubella (MMR) vac-
cine and autism. Wakeﬁeldbe—
came famous for urging parents

not to give their children the
MMR vaccine, and lots of par-
ents have taken him up on that
suggestion.

The controversial 1998 study it-
self has been “un-published” as
it were: The Lancet, the medical
journal that originally carried
the article, announced last Tues-
day that they were withdrawing
the article. The Lancet is evalu,-,
ating its review process, and
trying to avoid other publishing
ﬁrestorms in the future. .
Now, the original study itself
leaves room for doubts much
more considerable than those
entertained by the anti—MMR
crowd. The study under ﬁre in-
volved 12 children, 11 of whom
were male. I hope I’m not the
only one who wonders if a study
of 12 children might be a little
too small—scale to allow deﬁni-
tive conclusions, particularly in
regards to something as danger-
ous as urging parents not to get
their children vaccinated. The
paper itself seems a bit weak,
and the link between autismand

the vaccine appears to be based -

largely on circumstantial evi-
dence. '

Other‘ studies have shown no
link between autism and the vac-
cine. Despite all this, the hue and
cry against MMR has continued,
and will only get more intense
as those who support Wakeﬁeld
suggest that what is happening

- to him now is essentially part of

a huge medical cover—up.

This. -whole situation causes
problems. Whether or not the
charges of the Council are valid,
trust in peer-reviewed j ournals is
now less than absolute. With this 1
comes the possible danger that
somebody who says something
unpopular or aberrant willbe re-
garded as less credible, regard-
less of what the data suggests.
Occasionally, the people who
are right get laughed at — much.
like the way that those who sug-
gested that a bacterium caused
stomach ulcers were ridiculed
before they won the Nobel Prize
for their work.

There is also the problem of
tighterregulationofpeer-review.

- If The Lancet and other major

scientiﬁc publications turn away
controversial publications, there
is a possibility that voices might

’ not be heard, causing us to lose

Scientific studies lacking scientiﬁc discipline

out on important developments.

Dr. Wakeﬁeld himself, consider-
ing’ recent events, is probably
not one of the important voices
we should be listening to. His ag-
gressive refusal of vaccinations
has placed the public of Great
Britain and, to lesser extent, the
United States, in danger. Even if
the study was impeccably con-
ducted, it was wrong to take
something based on 12 kids and
scare the hell out of everyone in

the developed world.
This case also shows that many
people still do not have a good

idea of how scientiﬁc research .

is conducted. Studies have to be
repeated by many different peo-
ple, always producing roughly
similar results for those results
to be considered a reasonable
approximation of how the world
works. Those convinced of the
link between MMR and autism
disregard the very real debate in

_the medical literature that sug-
gests that, at best, it is far from
clear that the two are linked, and
at worst, that they are not linked
at all.

Through those who try to draw a
connection between the vaccine
and the disease, we see the worst
tendency exhibited in humans:
the rush to blame others. The
cause of autism remains elusive,
and its rise in recent years has

. been a troubling development.

Despite the fact that nobody —
not even the drug companies
making the MMR vaccine -
knows what really causes autism,
some parents of autistic children
lashed out, assuming the drug
companies were evilly sicken-
ing children in order to make a
proﬁt. The comfort brought to
people by the discovery of whose
head they should be seeking is

.perhaps the most insidious com-
~ fort of all.

Where this will all end up is any-
body’s guess. If more studies
come out showing no connec-
tion between vaccination and
autism, perhaps it will all dry up
and blow away. No matter what
happens, we must all learn the
dangers of acting passionately
before thinking, and of follow-
ing prophets who wind up being
discredited.

Communication with doctors as vital as Vitals

Ragini Grace Gupta
For The Pitt News

When you get sick you go to the
doctor, she prescribes you some
medicine and you go on your
merry way. But I have all too often
not gone on my merry way. Why?
I’m not getting my questions an-
swered. i

Let me give you a sampling of
what is an unfortunately long list
of my grievances. My dad went to
see a doctor only to ﬁnd the doc-
tor was already writing the pre-
scription before my dad had ﬁn-
ished explaining his symptoms. A
friend of mine was put on steroids
and not tapered off them, lead-
ing to a horrible allergic reaction.
Steroids, are a common enough
prescription that every doctor
should know patients should be
tapered off them. I have gone to
get blood work done only to ﬁnd
that not all the tests were writ-
ten on the order sheet and not

' enough blood was drawn. And

because Murphy’s law reigns, the
most important test was the one

But you can be satisﬁed and
you can be healthier. As with other
resources and opportunities, you
will get out what you put in. Stop
being a passive patient and take
responsibility for your health.

So why are we passive patients
instead of smart patients? Many
are intimidated by their doctor or
believe their doctor knows every-
thing. Doctors do know a lot, but
the body of scientiﬁc and medical
knowledge is constantly growing
and changing. According to a re-
port by the Institute of Medicine,

‘up to 98,000 people die due to

medical mistakes annually. This
could be in part because of human
error or negligence. All the same
—— you still need to be your own
safety net. If everyone watched
over her doctor’s shoulders, that
98,000-person statistic would
surely decrease. Also, doctors
have many patients, but you have
only one doctor and only one you.
If you are not an advocate for
yourself, who will be?

A key dilemma is the falsely
deﬁned roles that a patient and

doctor assume in the examination '

cian at the Michael E. DeBakey VA
Medical Center in Houston, says
the doctor-patient relationship
should be the meeting of two “ex-
perts.” Your doctor has medical
expertise, and you are an expert
on yourself. You have a lot of valu-
able information and your doctor
needs that information if she is
going to treat you effectively.

My cousin had abnormal
hormonal levels‘ even after try-

4 ing a few treatments. My aunt

thought she might have an insulin
problem because of family his-
tory. The doctor said she “really
didn’t think” that was the prob-

lem. Finally, six months later, my V

aunt insisted that my cousin get
a glucose ‘tolerance test. After
the numbers came‘ back higher
than normal and she was put on
the appropriate medication, her

hormone levels returned ‘to the
normal range. A family history of
diabetes is a strong indicator of
insulin problems since her type
is hereditary. Since her doctor
forgot, it was good that my aunt
did not. Make it your business to
know as much as you can.

Oz, a regular on the Oprah Win-
frey Show, doctors are forever
learning and gaining experience
through their patients. If a doc-
tor learns about new treatments,
indicators or side effects from
one patient, she is able to carry
on that new information to all her
patients. Hence, if a doctor is not
being questioned by her patients,
she stagnates and the quality of
areas of care never improves.

Being a “smart patient” is dif-
ﬁcult because it requires us to
modify the highly authoritative
role doctors traditionally have in
our society. Picking up some use-
ful habits will result in the desired
effect.

I Always ask questions. If you
don’t understand terminology
or are unfamiliar with a diagno-
sis, ask for an explanation. You
should know what is going on
inside of your body. Second, be
prepared. In the rush at the doc-
tor’s ofﬁce you are likely to forget
some things you wanted to talk to
your doctor about. You can solve
this problem by making a list of
important health issues before-

and after your visits. Try and get
some background knowledge be-
fore you go in and then read about
the speciﬁc things your doctor
mentioned.

Finally, after you understand
the mechanics and weigh the
choices, make sure you com-
municate with your doctor. If
you have concerns, voice them.
Be conﬁdent and remember it
is your right and responsibility
to ask questions and be listened
to. If you’re told, “No, that is not
possible” or the like, make sure
your doctor tells you why. Insist
on honest, focused and thorough
answers.

If I ever become concerned
with my health care and my role
in it, I remind myself that my doc-
tor is like my consultant and we
work together. The main goal of
any doctor is to help her patients
become healthier. It is important
to realize that doctors need our
help to accomplish this goal. Re-
ally, both patient and doctor have
the same goal and are on the same
side.

A weekend of winter celebration

Kieran Layton
A8-E Editor

‘ On Friday afternoon, the snow

began to fall, and it fell fast.

By Friday night, the snow
started to stick, inches piling up
like empty beer cans at stranded
college students’ apartments.

Cars began to veer off roads.
Students could be seen chuck-
ing snowballs and banding to-~
gether to push buried vehicles
from their snowy graves, only
to watch the cars get stuck again
minutes later. Power sporadically
went out for some throughout
the night.

Across Pitt’s campus, a single
sentiment rang out from the stu-
dent body: Welcome to Snow-
pocalypse 2010, everyone, and
get ready to rage.

And did we ever —— this week-
end proved to be one of the great-
est (and most random) partying

weekends of the year. Eat your

heart out, SempleFest. _

I foolishly ventured to Hem-
ingway’s Cafe on Friday night to
meet a friend, expecting a near-
empty bar due to the weather. I
found quite the opposite — it was
packed almost to capacity, full of
beer-swilling students celebrat-
ing the season’s epic coming-out
party. I heard stories of similar

crowds'at other bars, too.

The snow showed its appre-
ciation by coming down even
harder. .

By 1 a.m., South Oakland
had been officially transformed
into a massive, snow—covered

playground. Though met with.

disappointment by McDonald’s

closing because of the inclement ‘

weather, my friend and I reveled
in watching hoards of students
chuck snowballs and frolic up
and down the icy streets.

I went to sleep that night ea-
gerly anticipating the light the
morning would shed on this most
momentous of occasions.

The next day, all of Pitt was

;

Snowpocalypse 2010  

apparently feeling the effects of
the snow like a bad hangover.
Cars were buried and local resi-
dents of South Oakland looked
in despair at the shoveling task
ahead of them.

Most students—residents,
however, had no such concerns.

Around 2 p.m., a group of my
friends and .I decided to walk
around and take in the experi-
ence of Snowpocalypse.

With snow pants on and a
six-pack consumed, we began
our trek. We started down Ward
Street —— Ernest Shackleton pro-
tégés with Ugg boots on our feet,
beer in our bellies and a healthy
sense of adventure.

Snowballs and beer, like these on display in an Oakland driveway, ﬁgured heavily into the Snowpocalypse.

As we entered the heart of

v South Oakland, we watched as

students ﬂocked in droves to
one of the few Oakland estab-
lishments to remain open in the
inclement weather — Me1linger’s
Beer Distributor. Young men and
women carried beer cases back
to their apartment outposts as
if they were rations on an Arctic
expedition. Priorities took a very
speciﬁc order during Snowpoca-
lypse 2010.

We passed by a young man
and woman multiple times, ini-
tially scofﬁng at their supposed
work ethic to dig out their drive-
way. We were silenced when our
fourth passing revealed the true

Hip-Hop Week offers
chance for Kid Cudi

opening performance   _

Larissa Gula
Staﬁ” Writer

Pitt students will embrace the culture of
hip-hop_ next week as WPTS radio station
hosts its annual Hip-Hop Week, which in-
cludes Djs in dorm lobbies, a Djing com-
petition, a live on-air show and a dance
on Friday ’

This year WPTS is collaborating with
Pitt Program Council to plan the competi-
tion, scheduled for Tuesday at 8 p.m. in
Nordy’s Place. Students are welcome to
watch the competitors. At press time, 11

“A lot of people think it’s a type of mu-
sic,” Harris said. “But it’s a culture based
on urban storytelling. It’s based on young
people wanting to tell their story no matter
what their story was.” "

Hip—hop culture has its roots in 1970s
New York City, according to James Peter-
son, assistant professor of English at Buck-
nell University. Peterson teaches African-

American Literature and studies hip—hop

culture.

Peterson explained hip-hop has four
main elements: break dancing, Djing, graf-
ﬁti and rapping. During the 1970s, eco-
nomic and socioeconomic factors such as

groups had signed up to compete.

The winner of the hip—hop competition
will be announced after the show on Tues-
day and will open for the PPC—sponsored
Kid Cudi concert in_March.

At least half of a competing band’s mem-
bers must be Pitt students, but otherwise
the contest is completely open to any eager
performers, according to Corey Mizell (aka
D] KaraZmatiK), the hip—hop director for
WPTS.

Mizell,.a part-time Pitt student, has al-
ways been a DJ. He said this year’s collabo-
rations between WPTS and PPC presents a
major opportunity for students in bands.

“For anyone who’s always wanted to do
this, this will be a one moment to actually
see what it would feel like to see what it
would feel like to perform for thousands for
students,” Mizell said. “It can probably get
people to pursue this as a career  It takes
a lot of nerves to get up in front of a lot of
people on a massive stage and perform your
music and hope they like it.”

Former WPTS director Marcus Harris,
also a Pitt student, will perform in the com-
petition with his group, the BNVz. I

’fHatrris ‘is the founder’ of Pitt’s annual
hip-hop‘ week, which he hopes explains
and shares the culture of hip-hop.

the closing of art centers led, to the need
for expression in urban areas_. .

Today hip-hop is “just the most recent
installation of African—American oral and
folk culture and musical intervention,”
Peterson said. “Hip—hop is part of the his-
torical continuum of production which is

. largely responsible for all American music.

Hip—hop is also a repository. It samples
jazz, moves like the blues, and'it’s basically
merging with R&B.”

Hip—hop is also welcome in mainstream
music and culture because of historical
events, according to Peterson.

“It’s a blackart form, but it was based in
diverse communities. It was always pretty
diverse,” he said.

Music changed in the 1980s. Content
shifted from “public enemy” to a “gangster
consumerist form of the music that is acces-
sible to mainstream,” Peterson said.

Part of hip-hop culture tends to include
alternate names or personas between daily
life and stage life, something Mizell says
he’s just “always done.”

“There’s always a persona name which a

is like an alter ego because I’m a completely
different person when I’m Djing a party or
when I’m outside of my element, or being
everyday Corey,” Mizell said. “Now it’s time

sculpture. _
While no one actually went in the igloo

(not a safe idea), we marveled at their obvi— g

ous craftsmanship and dedication.

' There were snowballs thrown, cars
pushed (“Rock it, rock it V—— NOW GO!”),
more beer consumed and even snow angels
made in a parking lot. 4 ’ —

A word of advice: If you are ever tempt-
ed to roll around in a snowy parking lot,
make sure your phone is secured. Digging
for a cell phone in a three foot pile of snow
is the winter equivalent of searching for a
needle in a haystack. '

After hearing an enticing rumor that
Chipotle was among the other select
business open for the day, we headed up
Semple Street, only to ﬁnd a veritable frat
party turned on its snowy head. '

A makeshift beer pong table was nestled '

regally among a large group of college-
aged persons, all socializing and rejoic-
ing in the gifts the snow hadibrought.

Someone spoke of playing a game where
participants would jump out ofa second-

although I never found out how you won
such a game. A young woman with a torn
ACL hobbled around on self-proclaimed
“snow crutches,” letting the healing power
of snowy frolic work its magic. . ’
But most importantly, an eight—foot
mound of snow and dirt — apparently

‘the result of the snow covering a street

construction project ,— provided the arena
for the Desk Chair Sled Olympics.

In the spirit of the upcoming Winter _

Olympic games, someone had constructed
a masterfully-engineered contraption —
also known as a sled made out of a com-
puter desk chair, a wooden platform and a
pair of old skis —' suitable for transporta-
tion down a snow-covered incline.

Oakland snow mound.

I got home, I lay down in bed, cranked the

an incredibly fun day it had been.

_ Snowpocalypse 2010 has been an ex-
perience likely to come around only once
in an Pitt student’s career — if not a life-
time .— and surely I and my companions
‘were not the only ones to enjoy it to it’s
fullest. '

_ From what I witnessed, though, the
adult equivalent of a snow day not only
set the stage for students to have fun — it
gave -us the opportunity to become united

Harris explained his stage name is MH

the Verb, a name that came about because ,

he was a very active, energetic person when
he came to college.

“I’m not a noun, not a person. I’m away,”
he said.

Harris also explained some aspects of
hip-hop are not straightforward, such as
why it tends to be a male-dominated cul-
ture, 'or why the same artist will seem to
give conﬂicting messages in their songs.

“It’s conﬂicting at times, but we’re all
conﬂicted at times, and that’s the beauty of
hip-hop,” Harris said. “It’s a bit of a positive

outlet even when it’s not so positive.”

For Mizell, the collaboration of the com-
petition and PPC with Kid Cudi is a signiﬁ-
cant event during Hip-Hop Week.

“It allows all people to see all organi-
zations can work together and not be so

A separate,” he said. “This isla major insti-

tution but many organizations bringing

MEN'S BASKETBALL

Assistant Sports Editor

With the Pitt men’s basketball team
leading Seton Hall 41-37 about three
minutes into the second half, Brad Wa-
namaker was guarded byjohn Garcia
beyond the 3-point line. L

Right before the shot clock struck
zero, Wanamaker shot a high—arch-
ing ball over a leaping Garcia who, at
6—foot—9, is ﬁve inches taller than the
Pitt guard. While Wanamakerfell back-
ward, and the shot went in to give the
Panthers a 44-37 lead.

“Thatwas ahuge dagger, momen-
tum play for Pitt,” Seton Hall coach
Bobby Gonzalez said. “We played de-
fense for 35 seconds, guarded the heck
out of them.”

It was that kind of day for the Pan-
thers, who never let the Pirates within
seven points en route to an 83-58 vic-
tory Saturday at the Petersen Events
Center. The win ended a two—game
losing streak for the Panthers (17—6,
7-4 Big East) whose 83 points were a
season-best. They scored 82 points in
wins at Syracuse and against Louisville
earlier in the year.

Not only had the Panthers suf-

. feredconsecutivelosses,buttheyalso

lost four of their last ﬁve, Pitt’s worst
stretch since 2001. Ifthe Panthers
want to ﬁnish the year strong, they’re
going to need the offense to continue

to improve. In those ﬁve games, the

Panthers’ pointtotals were 66, 61, 63,
61 and 51.

Pitt is also 14th out of tlie 16-team
Big Eastin points, averaging67 a game.
The Panthers’ shootingpercentage —
44 — is 12th in the conference and

Pitt junior Gilbert Brown scored aigame-hi

Sat11rday’s gamewas astep inthe
right direction, as the Panthers shot

A big reason for the improved

offense against Seton Hall was ball

Did you see that awesome catch

I’m pretty much in limbo.

Yeah, that one commercial was

Luckily for me, there’s news
outside of the Super Bowl. And
double-luckily for me, thanks to
the Super Bowl, that news will be
buried deep down on all the big
websites and most of the big news-
papers. These stories are some-
thing I can talk about. ,.,

game win streak and hold a one-game lead
in their conference standings.

Robert Morris head coach Mike Rice is no
stranger to Oakland or the Petersen Events
Center. Before taking the reigns at Robert
Morris in 2007, Rice spent a year as an as-

-iasistant coach to Jamie Dixon at Pitt.

Since coming to the Colonials, Rice has
a 66-27 record and was named the NEC
Jim Phelan Coach of the Year two years in
a row.

Rice, whose father used to be the head
coach at Duquesne University, led the C010-
nials to the top of the NEC regular season
standings in each of his ﬁrst two seasons.
Last season, under Rice, Robert Morris won
its ﬁrst NEC Tournament championship in
17 years. '

On the court, the Colonials are led by

‘Bndersized guard Karon Abraham. As a
true freshman, the 5—foot-9 Abraham aver-

3—pointers with a 46 percent success rate.

impact though, as Robert Morris employs
a deep rotation that incorporates a large
portion of its bench. The Colonials have
eight players who average more than six
points per game.

put on ice

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s tennis team’s spring sea-
son opener at the University of Maryland was
postponed on Saturday because of poor weather
conditions. The Panthers and the Terrapins were
supposed to meetforthe ﬁrsttime in 30 years.

No make—up date is set yet for the match.

Pitt closed its fall season at the Wilson/ITA
Atlantic Regional Championships atVirginiaTech
on Oct. 27 and the Panthers willhavetowait until
laterthis weekto startplaying again.

A The Panthers will face off against Big East
rival West Virginia in Pittsburgh on Wednesday
at noon. '

The Mounlaineers played ﬁve games so farthis
seen, racking up a 3-2 record with victories over
Youngstown State, Liberty and James Madison.
In its latest match, West Virginia fell 6-1 to No. 71
Miami of Ohio.

The Wednesday match-upwillbe ﬂ1eﬁrstBig
East competition for both the Panthers and the
Mountaineers this season.

Following the match against West Virginia,
Pitt travels to Bucknell for a match on Saturday,

really being stagnant [with] just not enough
movement.”

In the Panthers’ two-game losing streak they
hadﬁve assists on16 successful shots againstwest
Virginia, and eight assists on 23 baskets against
South Florida. The Panthers had 16 assists on20
shots inawinagainst St.John’s, nine assists on 18
shots in a loss to Seton Hall and 14 assists on 26
buckets in a loss to Georgetown. '

“We played unselﬁsh,” Pitt coachjamie Dix-
on said. “We made the simple play, the simple
pass.”

The 20 assists, Pitt’s third-highest total this
year, tie the win against Louisville. The Panthers
dished out26 assists against Ohio and24against
Binghamton. ‘

But it wasn’t just ball movement that led to
scoring for the Panthers. It was also movement
without the ball. I

“The mainfocuswas nmning our motion and
setting screens, trying to create shots for other
people,” Brown said. “Ifyou have the defense
moving around, they start to break down and
lanes open up and you’re able to penetrate.”

Browntook advantage ofthe open lanes, scor-
ingagame—high23 points, his second highestas a
Panther. He scored25 inthelossto South Florida
Jan. 31, which he followedwithano—point showing

against Westvirginia.

 

“Coming from last game, and not scoring or
being productive in any part of the game, I just
really want to come‘ out and be aggressive and
assert myself,” he said.

, Another Panther who didn’t score against
WestV1rginiawas Wanamaker, buthe contributed
13 points in Saturday’s win. After his rainbow
3—pointer, he assisted anAshtonGibbs’ three. On
Pitt’s ensuing possession, Jermaine Dixon hit a
three to give Pitta13—point advantage. '
“Everythingwas going right for them. They
hitthree hugetl1ree’s inthe secondhalf,” Gonzalez
said. “Theyhitthreethree’s duringastretchwhere
they separated [from us] .”

Dixon ﬁnished second on the team with 15
points, Gibbs tossed in 11 and Gary McGhee
scored 12 to go withhis 11 rebounds. Wanamaker
ledthetearnwith7 assists, andﬁve otherPanthers
had at least two.

But noteverythingon offensewent smoothly »

for the Panthers. On a breakaway late with the
game out of reach, Brown went for a highlight
reel—worthy reverse jam. While in air, he turned
hisbackto the hoop andtriedto swinghis arms
down and around before slammingthe ball over
his shoulder, but instead clanked it off the rim.
“I thought I had it. It just felt good. It was a
shocker,” Brown said. “I thought it was in until I

I saw everybody’s face on the sidelines.”

Rants 4 13

All this baseball talk — and all that
beautiful snow outside, reminiscent of a
mid-April American League Central Division
game —-— makes me antsy for the upcoming
season. It’s two months away, which means
fantasy baseball is a month away. Disap-
pointing fourth-place ﬁnishes all around!

Meanwhile, tomorrow -— er, today — is a
rare reprieve from the Pitt-Big Ten rumors.
Be grateﬁil. Your Moriday—night lab may be
the last class for weeks that will not feature
some guy checking his cell phone after class
and shouting to no one in particular outland-
ish, Onion-like breaking news.

So far, I’ve heard “Pitt and Syracuse to the

Big Ten” and “Pitt to the Big Ten for football “

and Purdue to the Big East in basketball.” I
also heard that West Virginia was included

on Pitt’s out—of—conference schedule next’

year.

The more subtle text—shouters simply
say “Pitt to the Big Ten! It’s official!” It’s just
believable enough to earn a quick Google
search to deny its accuracy.

Of course, nothing will get done in all this

snow — except college basketball games.‘

Pitt had almost 7,000 in attendance for its
game against Seton Hall, even though the
school told driving season-ticket holders
to stay home because of poor road condi-
tions.

Georgetown faced similar problems, as
some sort of The Day After Tomorrow—type
storm dumped several feet of snow on the

nation’s capital. The Hoyas, too, won their

game, beating No. 2 Villanova, 103-90.

Meanwhile, where snow didn’t cancel
weekend bingo, No. 1 Kansas came from
behind to beat Nebraska in a rivalry that
goes all the way back to 1850s legislature.
If any school is a lock for the Final Four, it’s
the Jayhawks, who are now 22-1.

There were also a few wonderful, careful-
ly-scheduled-as-to-notconﬂict-with-foot-
ball hockey games over the weekend. The
best game featured Alexander Ovechkin and
the Capitals against Sidney Crosby and the
Penguins — but that game ended after my
deadline, too. Did Washington make it 14 in
a row? [Editoris note: Yes, unfortunately.]

' The Atlanta Thrashers played their ﬁrst
post-Ilya Kovalchuk game Saturday night,
beating Florida, 4-2. Oddly enough, it was
the highest-attended game of the season for
the Thrashers. ' I <

Speaking of Kovalchuk and speaking of
snow — double tie-in, boom — the Olympics
start up Friday. I’ll be blogging about all the
Olympic hockey action on pittnews.com as
Kovalchuk tries to lead Russia to its ﬁrst gold
medal since its Soviet Union days.

Though I’m not great at predictions, I like
the United States’ chances to outdo expecta-

tions and earn a medal. Goaltending wins .

games, and America has the NHL’s top goalie
this season in Michigan native and Buffalo
Sabre Ryan Miller. .
And although it might seem a little bit late
for you, I have one more prediction to make:
Indianapolis, 31-21. Was I right? '

Pitt looks
to guards
fordefense

Morris < 14

and 71—5 9, respectively.

Coming off an 83-58 thumping of Seton in

Hall, the Panthers would like to replicate
_that offensive production as they prepare

‘ ‘ fora rematch against West Virginia at the

end of the week. -

‘Most of Pitt’s‘offensive output against
Seton Hall can be attributed to the perfor-
mance of redshirt junior Gilbert Brown, who,
after being held scoreless in Morgantown
Wednesday, scored 23 points and shot 9-14
from the ﬁeld against the.Pirates.

, Another Panther who bounced back was
Gary McGhee. After struggling to ﬁnish at
the basket against the Mountaineers, he col—'
lected a double-double against Seton Hall
(12 points, 11 rebounds).

It will be important for McGhee and
Brown to repeat those performances in the
future.

However, one of the most important fac-
tors of the Pitt-Robert Morris contest will.
be the performanceof the Panther guards
while on defense. .

Jermaine Dixon, Ashton Gibbs, and Brad
Wanamaker will need a strong performance
on the defensive end to combat not only
Abraham, but also Mezie Nwigwe and Velton
Jones. Together, the senior Nwigwe and the
redshirt freshmanjones average a combined
17.2 points per game.
