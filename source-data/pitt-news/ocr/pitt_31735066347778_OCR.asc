Renovations for undergraduate

‘f‘l,»:..

By MREA CSORBA

Political science professor John
Chapman yesterday denounced the
unanimous vote of the University
Senate Council hearing board for
the re-appointment‘ of sociologist
Paul Nyden. '

He alleged the board’s misunder-
standing of the criteria by which
academic appointment is reviewed
invalidates their recommendation
to the Chancellor to re-hire the
assistant professor.

The hearing board, convened by
the Chancellor April 16 to examine
alleged procedural irregularities,
which Nyden charged cost him his
job, concluded that the department
failed to explicitly convey to Nyden
the criteria by which his work would
be judged. This constituted ‘a
procedural defect serious enough to
warrant giving him another con-
tract, the board ruled. '

In a two-page memorandum
distributed yesterday among the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS)
and sent to the Chancellor’s office,
Chapman held that the board’s
recommendation was given “under
the guise of procedural defective-
ness.”

Chapman maintained the board
invaded an area -of professional
judgment, which in this case, is

reserved for the sociology depart-
ment. This encroachment, with
their misunderstanding of the
criteria, invalidates the board’s
recommendation, he said.

The communique argued that a
re-appointment based, not on past
but prospective work, is not against
normal expectations. The board
had reported Nyden spent his three
years here revising his widely
acclaimed Columbia Ph. D. disser-
tation. His department, however,
concentrated their review on his

more recent works. On the basis of
,0 this descrepan-cy, the board recom-
mendedi his contract renewal.

Chapman said he was concerned
only in the principles which ran this
university. “It would be a disaster
to establish a criteria of prospective
performance and not follow it.”
Chairman of the hearing board, law
professor Richard Seeburger, who
last night dismissed the validity of
Chapman's charges, said, “He’s

L wrong.”

“From a lawyer’s point of view, I
think it’s wonderful that he is
speaking his mind,” Seeburger
said. ‘ ‘I’m conﬁdent if he is making
any valid points, then his criticism
will stand.”

Seeburger read the communique’

at a meeting with the Chancellor
last evening. Declining to comment
on the substance of this meeting,
executive assistant to the Chancel-
lor Edward Bozik, said, “We
discussed the /whole Nyden busi-
ness.”

He did say", however, the delay in
the Chancellor’s responseto the
vote by the hearing board, which
was expected to come last week, is

due to the complicated nature of the

issue. _

“I think it’s a fair inference that
the delay is due to the problems of
implementing his decision and not
neccessarily that the response will
be negative to Nyden.”

allows for the accomodation of 250
students in four-person, two-room
suites with private baths.

A , folio of options should be
completed by January, Martin said.
At that time, bids for a contract can
be elicited.

The offices currently in Bruce
Hall, including the Graduate School
of Public and International Affairs,
will be relocated to the Cathedral or
Quadrangle, vacating all but the
second, third and 12th ﬂoors of
Bruce Hall for the dormitory.

The second and third ﬂoors will
serve as student-related offices,
perhaps admissions, while the 12th
ﬂoor will remain a reception area,
Bozik said. ‘

The conversion of Bruce Hall is
one of several alternatives, includ-
ing the construction of another
building,

Outdoor Musical Cafe
Summer Program Event

_ By LINDA SPECK

An outdoor musical cafe is one
event scheduled by the Ofﬁce of
Student Activities this summer to
encourage the use of student’s
activities fee, according to Pat
Grim, director of summer sessions.

“I think not only students, but
also alumni, faculty and visitors
should be encouraged to recognize
the cultural resources available to
them,” Grim said;

The project is a coordinated effort
of the Resident Student Associa-
tion, the Student Union Board,
Student. Government and the Ofice
of Student Activities.

Five programs were selected
from an initial list of 15 events
ranging from a wine-flow disco to a
clothesline art show.

Beginning May 16, the SU patio
will be converted in to a sidewalk
cafe, which will operate Monday

"through Fridays, serving free cold

drinks, and lunches for a dollar.
The musicans providing live
entertainment will include “Buck
Dancers Choice,” “Mike Henry
and Paul Turnbull,” “Trim and
Velvet,” “Country Ramblers,”

“Minanze Marimba Ensemble,”‘

“The Run of the Mill String Band,”
and “Jim Coor.”

Other events include a resident
artist’s woodcraft show on May 18
and 25, a weekend getaway during
July 8, 9, 10, a‘ Schenley Park
band-picnic and a Gateway Clipper
cruise.

The $15 program is being funded
by Student Government,‘ ~ the
Student Union Board and the Ofﬁce
of Student Activities.

The Student Government Board,
Grim said, has pledged another
$5,000 for the program’s continua-
tion, if it is successful this year.

A survey attempting to measure
its success will be ‘administered on
June 13.. . ‘

three candidates are seeking seats.
The recommendations of ‘such a

commission could become a consti-

‘tution for county government.

Endorsing the rejection are
Christine Altenburger, assistant
dean of the ‘Graduate School of
Public and International Affairs
(GSPIA); GSPIA Dean John Funari;
GSPIA associate professor» Leon J.
Haley; John P. Robin, chairman of
the Urban Redevelopment Author-
ity and Joseph James, urban affairs
professor who chaired the 1974
County Charter Commission.

“There has been very little
political support for a charter,”
Altenburger said. “There must be
strong support for the» home rule to
work.”

Voters rejected the 1974 commis-
sion’s charter.

“Only the League of Women
Voters expressed support for a
home rule charter. The academic
community has said nothing about
the proposal. There has been no
support from the public sector,”
Altenburger said. “Without this
support, Allegheny County won’t
get the home rule charter it needs.

“With so many people running
for the commission, it also is highly,
unlikely a cohesive group will result
from,\ the election should the
proposal be accepted.”

Of the 73 candidates, 32’ are
employed by various county ofﬁces
and departments.

“As such,. they could be
considered proxies for the elected
officials for whom they work,” the
experts’ position paper stated.
“Their institutional loyalties might
lead them to either maintain the

status quo or seek additinal powers.’

for the officials they serve.”

“One of my concerns with the’

proposal if that I don’t see what the
county can gain from going to home
rule,” James said. “The county’s
major problem is its inability to
generate income. Home rule in no
way enlarges the county’s ability to
increase its revenue.”

Activities $  
Funds SGS
Scholarships

A $10,000 check to fund School of
General Studies (SGS) scholarships
will be presented to Chancellor
Wesley Posvar by SGS Student
Cabinet members Friday.

The new scholarship program for
night students is the first at Pitt and
among the few in the country.

The funds were accumulated
from unspent activities fees.

The award, to be given annually
beginning in 1978, is for academic
excellence, with consideration giv-
en to_ extra-curricular‘ activities,
community service and financial
need.

Students with between 30 and 90
credits will qualify for the
scholarship.

More than two-thirds of the night
students pay some or all of their
college education. Many receive
ﬁnancial aid  their employers.

A Welcome Freeze

It’s easy to_get people to support a good idea. The hard part
comes when one tries to put them to work and make this idea.

' reality. “ —*

The Student Government Assembly is such an idea. Many a

' recognized organization has yet to name a representative to this
\

governing body. -
So the Student’ Government Board (SGB) did what can be con-
sidered the best move possible, they _ froze the budget of
organizations that have yet to name representatives.
Everybody who was somebody, and a lot who weren’t, supported
the Student Assembly. Where are they now?
Getting student organizations to join the assembly has had a low
rate of success. A fraction of the 117 eligible groups have-joined
thus far. I ‘\ -

It is safe to assume that this lack of response contains no
organized opposition to this new bureaucracy. Many a group is
inactive during the summer. Leaders probably have been too

. wishy-washy to name a representative. ‘

Freezing the budgets of recalcitrant groups will encourage "these

‘ groups to name a representative.

A group with a frozen budget cannot spend any money. Without
being able to spend any money, the organization is virtually inac-
tive. So the threat of loss of active status hands over their head.

This move serves a second purpose. Groupsthat accept their an-

,nual allocation and then do little will be discovered and deac-
- tivated, saving student money.

The beauty of this move is the simple solution around its con-
sequences. All a recognized organization need do is fill out the
necessary forms, name a spokesman andwatch their budget thaw. 

It is in the interest of groups that wantto remain active, and
students who want a more representative student government, to
get this student assembly rolling. Strict enforcement of this budget
freeze is what is needed. ‘

Once rolling, a problem it will face is irregular participation by
some groups, perhaps to the point where they rarely attend
meetings. It is hoped that the SGB will continue its stri_ct stance
and strongly encourage attendance by problem groups.

As I understand it, the “final”
Faculty Appeals Committee deter-
mined thatithe sociology depart-
ment had made a “procedural”
error signiﬁcant enough to preju-
dice any evaluation iof Nyden’s
performance, hence Nyden should
be given a three-year extension of
his contract. While the Chancellor,
Dean, and others have argued that
the procedural error was not all that
signiﬁcant, any such argument
must be dismissed as nonsense. An
error signiﬁcant enough to affect
. such a decision is not a minor error,

I have never met Professor
Nyden, and I am not a Marxist;
indeed, Marxists familiar with my
work despise me (as do traditional
conservatives). Nor am I all that
sympathetic with some of the
activities undertaken in past
‘months by pro-Nyden and anfi~
Nyden factions. The material
presented in the May 5 issue of the
flu News, however, is terribly
disturbing; assuming accurate re-
porting, it does not speak well for a
major university. -

Letters to the Editor  

- woman Athlete Explains) Bullman Conﬂict

I believe it is necessary to make
the inconsistencies of our women’s
athletic director's policies clearer

by addressing her statements of ,

April 8th, in the Pitt News article
“Bullman Talks Back.”

,I am the volleyball player whose
scholarship was threatened last
year. While waiting to speak with
another member of her staff

concerning an academic matter,

Miss Bullman asked me to come
into her ofﬁce. It was during this
unscheduled and unexpected con-
versation that Miss Bullman told me
that ifl didn’t shape up and play up
to the potential that she knew I had

‘ (despite injury), I would find myself

without an athletic scholarship for
my senior year. Her statement was
greatly upsetting because I had no
hope of being able to afford the
out-of-state tuition necessary to

pl;\lyden’bs Fate in Hands  Those Who Goofed

l

.. and it is not a hopeful sign that the

Dean, in his handling of the case
over a long period, never noticed
the error, or chose to ignore it.

Given the fact that universities

are not growing as they used to, and‘ ‘

that faculty members denied
contract extensions or tenure
anywhere are unlikely to ﬁnd
similar employment elsewhere, a
decision against contract renewal is
coming ever closer to a denial of
employment for life; this is not the
intention, but it is the logical result
in today’s world. " From this
perspective, the‘ sociology depart-
ment’s’ error was indeed a major
one, threatening the entire profes-
sional life of a junior faculty
member. Faced with such threats,
individuals are unlikelyrto respond
in “reasonable’_’\ ways; indeed, it
-may be the case that in the absence
of a high noise level, nothing would
have happened, and Nyden quietly
would have disappeared (as many
doubtless would have preferred).

Those in the sociology depart-
ment who now plead with
University administrators to treat
Nyden as the proverbial “man
without a country” seem to have
quickly forgotten that they created
the problem in the first place. Can
they not see that if their newest
petition is successful, they will only
compound the problem a bit more?
Professor Nyden already can argue,
and logically, that he has been
denied more than a year of
professional development because

i

finish my degree; the net effect on
my performance was quite nega-
tive. ‘

In the article “Bullman Talks
Back”, Miss Bullman stated:
“Kat-hy was never threatened to
have her scholarship taken away
from her. Not by me or any of the

‘other people‘ in the room.” In
actuality, no one else was present in
the room during our conversation.
By her own .statement, Miss
Bullman is admitting that the event
did take place, and so this issue
boils down to my word against hers.

Ihave a clear conscience because I '

have not lied and have nothing to
fear from the truth.

But I would like to ask Miss
Bullman whether she can say with a
clear conscience that she has not
lied and has told the entire truth.
Generally a person in her high-level

of the need to ﬁght for his life, and
he could,easily argue two years from
now that assignment as ‘a “ﬂoat-
ing” professor could not possibly
lead to a fair evaluation of his
. competence. , I

(Yale University President) 
man Brewster used to say that
tenure is needed not only to protect
faculty members from capricious
administrators, but also from each
other. The sociology department is
now giving us an example of this
and, if Nyden returns to the
department, many of its members
doubtless will produce a local
version of the historically shameful
“silent treatment” given West
Point cadets who do not resign when

declared “dishonorable” by their i

peers. They are L acting out a
- scenario which proves Nyden’s case
for him; the attempt to squelch him,
silence him, "exclude him, and
otherwise punish him, regardless of
the official disposition of his case,
can easily be read as political
repression. I suggest they swallow
their foolish pride, ‘fess up to their
error, cease giving us an example of
Soviet-‘style repression of dissi-
dents, and admit they have a
responsibility to not.‘ attempt to
outdo deans, provosts, and chancel-
lors in making bad decisions. After
all, it remains possible that many
Nydens in this world, given fair
treatment, may produce something
outstanding.

position could be expected to state
the truth and deal with the issue
honestly,‘ however, it disappoints
and disgusts me to say that this has

not been the case with Miss .

Bullman.

She also“ states later in the same
article; “I am the administrator in
women's athletics and  feel the
coach's first contact is me and the
player’s ﬁrst contact is the coach. ”
By calling me into her office,
without first going through my
coach (and especially to threaten
something she had no right or
power to carry out), Miss Bullman
deﬁed her own alleged administra-
tive policy of following a set chain of
command for internal matters.

This seemingly purposeful incon-
sistency between administrative
action and policy is highly
inexcusable for an administrator in
her "position of power. Unfortun-
ately, my ‘case has not been the
exception, -but practically the rule.
And although I am in a position to
give details only about my . own
situation, there have been a number
of women athletes needlessly
discouraged and hurt by the
practices of our women’s athletic
director.

A logical solution would be to
bring the criticisms to Miss

" Bullman’s attention, with the hope

that she would wish to bring about
the necessary changes herself. In
light of the fact that this step has
already been taken and no changes
havebeen forthcoming, I wish to go
on record as advocating that Miss
Bullman be asked to resign from her

‘position of assistant athletic direc-

tor for women’s athletics. My
rather radical stand comes not just
from the impact her threats have
had in my life, but also from the
knowledge that she has, and does,
feel free and justiﬁed in doing the
same thing, over and over to other
women athletes--without fear of
retribution from the University
hierarchy.

Miss Bullman’s presence in the
athletic program has been, in many
respects, detrimental to its goal of
gaining national recognition. A
number of national-caliber athletes
and coaches have dropped out of the
program, transferred to other
universities, or resigned their
positions on being hassled by her
interventionist administrative pol-
icies and actions. It seems to me the
University is only hurtingitself by
allowing an administrator of Miss
Bullman’s level of incompetence
and unethical orientation to remain
in her present position.

We all live in a very strange
country.

It was only seven-years-ago that
four normal college students were
gunned down by National guards-
men on the campus of Kent State
University in Ohio during a protest
against the Vietnam war. The date
was May 4, 1970.

Yet it was only last week, the very
same day May 4, 1977 only seven
years after the brutal killings at
Kent State, that Richard M. Nixon,
the only President of the United

V W

K J

States forced to resign in office
because of his involvement in the
Watergate scandal—the most un-
savory scandal in our 200 year
history—received $600,000 for his
four interviews with British jour-

’ nalist/ interviewer/ producer David

Frost.

What is so disturbing is that
Nixon undoubtedly played an
integral part in the tactics of
National Guardsmen on college
campuses during \the _demonstra-
tion years of the late ’60s and early
’70s.

When weighing the circumstan-
ces and irony of these events, one
need not be a bleeding-hearted
liberal to realize the great injustice.

IHere we have four kids killed
without reason, whose involvement
in the sporadic violent activities at
Kent State has never been proven-
conclusively.

Then we have a President, who
lied and coimived to the American
people about his involvement with
all the sordid aspects of Watergate
receive a healthy sum of money to
come before the public and say the
same things he said three-years-ago
when he was forced to resign from
office. It doesn’t seem fair.

The first broadcast in the series of
four interviews was not what it
should have been.

Frost—well prepared, dapper
and engaging——-started with hard-
line questions. He continually
confronted Nixon with well-doc-
umented accounts of his conspira-
torial activities with the White
House staff concerning the coverup.

Nixon, however, would admit to

‘nothing more than “letting the

American people down”.

During the first half of the
90-minute interview, Nixon, gray-
haired with cheeks and jowls puffier
than most of us remember, had an
extremely difficult time defending
«himself against Frost’s well sup-
ported accusations and questions
concerning criminal involvement.

To many Americans it seemed
evident that the man they had voted
into office for two consecutive
terms, was not telling the truth.

Nixon stammered when respond-
ing to questions, giving the
impression he was lying.

Later in the interview, Frost
made the mistake of softening his
verbal assault on Nixon.

You almost felt sorry for Nixon in
the second-half of the interview; but

wh\at\must be remembered is that
although Nixon has been privately
humiliated, politicaly ruined and
publicly disgraced since the
disclosure of Watergate, he did not

go to jail like many of his
accomplices who were forced to
stand trial for their crimes.

Certainly, we should feel compas-
sion for Nixon; but he didn’t earn
the paycheck he received for the
ﬁrst part of the interview.

A clear factual accounting of
Nixon’s involvement in Watergate
was what everyone had been
promised on numerous commer-
cials and media hype since the

announcement of the interviews
some 18-months-ago but didn’t get
it.
Although Frost is not an
American citizen and though he,
like Nixon, is making a bundle from
the interviews, he certainly has all
the credentials for what many
consider the most. important event
of the year.
Frost and staff had done their
hpmework on Nixon and Watergate,

Thursday, May 12, 1977 —THE PITT NEWS—-Page -5

P Nixon Interview: Bitter Salt in Sore Wounds

but Frost’s softening toward the
end of the first interview, gave us
mush instead of the hard facts
which we had been promised
and—more important—deserve.

The next three interviews,
dealing with Nixon’s foreign policy,
domestic policy and what he has
been doing since he left office
three-years-ago, do not seem as
important as the Watergate inter-
view.

Nixon should breeze through the
next three interviews and return to

San Clemente a freeman who has _

just struck a gold mine.
The first interview was the time
I when Nixon could have told the
truth to the American people.
Ironically, Nixon’s interview was
presented to us on the seven-year
anniversary of the Kent State
shootings, it serves as bitter salt in
sore wounds.

By DAVE McDONALD

If you’re into 10-speeds more
than buying a Sears’ Free Spirit or
a Murphy’s Special, you’ll pro-
bably be willing to spend $150 an
up for a good bike. ’

With good quality 10-speeds, the
lighter their frame the higher the

_ price. This seems crazy, but when

you have to peddle up hills
(especially in the Pittsburgh area),
this lightness is essential.

When shopping for .a bike-,
look at its frame; it determines the
cycles quality and price. Frames
are made of alloyed metal or steel.
The alloy type is more expensive,

lighter and_ has a chrome-moly a

frame. Frames come in all colors
and sizes (from 19‘/2 inches to 25
inches) and usually are guaranteed
for at least 10 years; some _\come
with a lifetime guarantee.

After checking the frame inspect
the handbrakes. For brake styles,"
there are the Weinmann and
DiaCompe centerpulls, the Wein-
mann being the better of the two.
In choosing or replacing a brake
shoe, Malhauser brakes are re-
commended because of their
superior ability to stop in the rain,
however, they cost more than usual
(around $15). M

The levers that do the shifting on
the bike are in three places: of the
the stem leading to the handlebars;
the down tube of the frame; or the
end of the handlebars. Most racing
bikes have their levers on the down
tube, but bikes with shifting levers
on the end of the handlebars may
be preferable because they are

easier to reach without losing
control of the bike.
Handlebars -are all basically the
same although the alloy SR brand
are suggested inmost bike stores.
Important features on the wheel
include the hubs, rims, spokes and
tires. The hubs are made of alloy
or steel and come with bolts or a
quick release lever for easy wheel
takeoff. The hubs with quick
release are recommended. Vis-

' count bicycles have sealed bearings

 , I ‘
in the hubs which reduce effort-

when cycling. The sealed bearing
hubs keep dirt out of the bearings.
Weinmann spokes and rims have
the best stability. Spokes are of
3-cross or 4-cross but they don’t
make much difference. "V i ,
There are tubular or regular tires.
The tubular tires are very
expensive and difficult to repair.

F BingA BikeBuiIt for You

Therefore, racers should only be
concerned with this type.

The crankset, the device pedals
are connected to, should be
lightweight. Solid, cotterless
crankset is more expensive, but
more durable.

There are two types of pedals,
racing and road. Racing pedals
have toe clips and straps; road
pedals don't. Of the two, racing

pedals are the most comfortable. ‘-
A As for seats, leather is usually

2

the best buy but they also can be
made of plastic or nylon.

You should also be aware of the
technical aspects of bicycles.
Derailleurs are the devices that
move the chain from one sprocket
to another. Sun Tour and Shimano

Know Laws Before You Pedal

By PATTY TASCARELLA

Bicycles are making a fantastic
comeback. No longer is bike riding
only for obnoxious grade school
kids who scoot about on ﬂoures-
cent-painted two-wheelers with
butterﬂy handlebars. Now, sleek
10-‘speeds are becoming increas-

j_ ingly common in the stream of
traffic and people of all ages are
being swept up in mania, with
many travelers using them in place
of a car.

.With the increase in bicycle‘

usage state intervention inevitably
followed. For years, Oregon has
had bike paths set up alongside the
main roads. Pennsylvania’s
~ solution, however, was to pass
legislature that would establish
guidelines for bicycle riders.
“Bicycles have become as much
a part of traffic as cars and
therefore the riders have the same
rights and duties as other

v motorists,” said Representative

James M. Burd.
During the 1975-76 state con-
) gressional year, the Pennsylvania
General Assembly adopted a new
Motor Vehicle Code which con-
‘ tains numberous regulations for
bicycle riders.

The new laws, which carry a $10
penalty for violators, go into effect
July 1. ‘

Some of the new laws are:

Ride on a bike path if one is
provided along the highway.

Ride as close to the right side of
the roadway as possible so you
won’t interfere with motor vehicle
traffic.‘ Riding against the flow of
trafﬁe is a violation. *

Yield the right-of-way to pedes-
trians, and give an audible signal
before riding up behind a person
and passing him.

Obey all traffic signals, stop
signs, red lights, and other posted
directions. \

Don’t carry anyone on your
bicycle unless you have a bicycle
built for two. Parents may carry a
child in a securely fastened sling
seat. The bicycle driver must ride
on the bicycle seat. '

Don’t carry any packages or
bundles if you are unable to keep at
least one hand on the handlebars.

Don’t ride on the sidewalk in a
business district unless you are
permitted to do so by official traffic
control signs.

Only park a bike where it does
not block pedestrian traffic or is not
in the way of automobiles.

The regulations for required
bicycle equipment are as follows:

The bike musthave (1) a light on
the front that is visible from 500
feet, (2) a red reflector on the rear
that can be seen from at least 100
feet, (3) amber reﬂectors on both

sides of the bike, (4) brakes that
stop a bike within 15 feet at a speed
of 15 miles per hour on normal
pavement, (5) a horn or bell is
optional but a siren is not
permitted.

“Basically, good common sense
and a realization that taking
chances on a bicycle could cost you
your life is a deﬁnite rule to follow
if you have doubts about a speciﬁc
procedure when riding your bike, ’ ’
Burd said.

—Not only are traffic accidents for
bicyclists increasing’, but simple
(and some not so simple) injuries
are also on the rise. ,

A 10-speed bike is a lot easier to
pedal than earlier types, but the
rider should not try to travel too far
without physical preparation. A
person can strain ligaments in_ the
lower leg from too much exertion
and, in the hot weather, suffer
from overexposure to the sun.

There is also the problem of
getting a pant leg caught in the
bicycle chain. Bike experts and
fashion pages alike dictate tight
pant legs for the serious cyclist.

Pedal Pumpers
Push the Limit

By KEITH SRAKOCIC

At 5:30 a.m. Saturday morning it
started to rain in Columbus, Ohio.
In the late-morning darkness,

thousands of cycling enthusiasts
pulledaponchos over their heads,
pumped gum-wall tires and lubri- _
cated derailleurs, preparing for the
country’s most popular bicycle

¢.,.

 

tour—Tour of the Scioto River
Valley (TOSRV).

The tour, in its 17th year, starts at
the State Capital Building in
Columbus and winds its way 105
miles over the ﬂatlands of Ohio to
Portsmouth, located on the border
of Ohio and Kentucky.

This conglomeration of mechan-
ical and physical endurance was
first introduced to the masochistic
masses in 1962 by Greg Seipple, the

same man who thought it might be
fun to ride halfway around the world
(from Point Barrow to Cape of Good
Hope). Only 27 went on that
maiden TOSRV compared to the
3,800 who ventured through the
rain, darkness and terrible head-
winds this past weekend.

There are three food stops Each
day with an unlimited supply of
sweet morsels and Kool-Aid to fuel
the riders’ piston-like legs. The
highest point of the trip is the
chicken dinner served in Ports-
mouth that is so juicy that an old
colonel from across the border has
been known to pull on cycling shorts
to sneak a few bites. ,

Sléep comes easy after the last
gulp of food, but it was time to check
over the bikes. The seat needed
adjustment, the back tire had a slow
leak and there wasa funny squeak
in the crank, nothing a good dose of
WD-40 wouldn’t cure.

The gymnasium, in which a
portion of the participants spent the
night, lit up at 4:30 a.m. Sunday to
groans» about tender derrieres and
the cracking of rusty knees. After a
hot shower and a silent prayer the
return trip on Route 104 began.

Draft packs of riders not more
than three inches apart stretched
across the bridge as the sun rose
through the fog. Bikes 101 feet
ahead looked like blurs. ,The 47
degree temperature cramped
thighs and legs but the major
victims of the cold’were the riders"
hands.

Finally the skyscrapers of Col-

umbus peeked above the horizon.

“Island ” Is  Real Treasure

By DAN KACZMARSKI

Singing pirates?

Prancing, dancing buccaneers?

Grown men in colorful‘ costumes
making children squeal with
delight?

Ah, yes. All this and more.

But before anyone entertains
images of Willie Stargell and
company pirouetting about Three
Rivers Stadium, it should be noted
that these were not baseball, but
real pirates. Or at least
make-believe real pirates.

Long John Silver and his crew
commandeered Heinz Hall Mon-
day through Wednesday, as the
New York based Fanfare Theatre

Ensemble presented ﬁve perfor-
mances of “Treasure Island.”

The youngsters sat on the edges
of their seats, open-mouthed, as
14-year-old Jim Hawkins, played
with bouncy, bright-eyed enthus-
iasm by Joan Shepard, became
entangled in the expedition to sail
in search of a treasure cache buried
somewhere on a deserted isle.

En route to the island the motley
and altogether nasty crew, led by
Evan Thompson as Long John
Silver, decides to mutiny, with the
plan of finding the fortune for
themselves and tidily disposing of
Jim, the captain, and the few men
who choose to remain honest.

“Hero” Big Step for Little Feat 

By RANDY GAYSEK

Only in America could ‘a group
like Little Feat produce honest
American hard rocking music for
six years and be more popular in
Europe than in the States. Long
lauded for its cult band status on
the Continent, Little Feat might‘
have just produced the album that
will give them their well-deserved
domestic notoriety——‘ ‘Time Loves a
Hero.”

Like Little Feat’s five other
albums, “Hero” is a clean logical
step in the group's music. The
studio-perfect production is re-
miniscent of the" Doobie Brothers’
“Taking it to the Streets.” And
with good reason. Both albums
were produced by studio wizard
Ted Templeton, and Brothers Jeff
“Skunk” Baxter, Patrick Simmons
and Mike McDonald help out on

enough to hold its own outside the
studio.

Even though “Hero” is one of '

those rare albums that sound better
the more you hear it, it has not
received much F.M. play, and

Batters Bite Bullets;
Beaten by Bucknell

By MARY s. HUZINEC

0‘ It’s amazing how different a
team can look from one day to the
next. On Tuesday, only two days
after dropping a doubleheader to
Penn State, the Pitt baseball beam
got some excellent pitching and
exploded for 16 hits to defeat
Gettysburg, 11-1. Unfortunately,

‘the runs didn’t come so easily
yesterday as the Panthers lost a
squeaker to Bucknell, 4-3, leaving
their record at 9-7.

“We should have beat Buck-
nell,” siad coach Bob Lewis. “It
was a good game and we played well
but we didn’t get the hits when we
needed them. Their pitcher pitched

‘ well—you can’t takethat away from
him. As the .game went on he got

- stronger and the team toughened

up defensively.”

Tow consecutive Bucknell errors
in the infield enabled Pitt to score
early. Kurt Leitholf led off the
second inning by bouncing a single
up the middle. Bucknell’s shortstop
couldn’t come up with a double-play
ball hit by Mark Stevens so Leitholf
advanced to second. John Susi then
walked to load the bases. ’

Leitholf and Stevens scored when
the second baseman fumbled Ken
Muckle’s grounder. Susi came
home when Don Nania dropped a

'ﬁelder’s choice into center, making
the score 3-0.

Bucknell got a run in the third by
combining a single with three
walks.

Dave ‘Crist relieved starter Tony
DiSaia in the fourth.

In the sixth inning Bucknell
scored three more runs and held Pitt
to leave the score at 4-3.

On Tuesday against Gettysburg
senior pitcher Les Qualk went the
distance, hurling a ﬁve hitter. The
first pitch of the game was lined
over the right ﬁeld fence and the
situation looked grim, but Qualk
settled down to handle the
Gettysburg bats while his team-
mates tormented the Gettysburg
pitchers. 

Pitt exploded for four runs in the
second, one in the fifth, one in the
sixth, two in the seventh and three
in the eighth.

The Pitt track team ﬁnally
brings its traveling road show
home thisweekend to host the
seventh annual Pitt Invitational.
Pitt stadium will be invaded by
more than 20 teams from schools
all over the East. “Big name”
school such as Ohio State, Penn
State, East Carolina and West
Virginia will bring full teams to vie
for the prestigious Pitt invitational

-Girvin, Mills Find Success

At EAIAW Championships

ByMARIASCIULL0I

EAST STROUDSBURG. PA——Ol-

‘ ympic high jumper Paula Girven of

Maryland and Penn State distance
runner Kathy Mills were only two of

the many success stories at the‘

Eastern Association" for Athletics

_ for Women (EAIAW) track and ﬁeld
I championships last weekend.

The high jump competition,
spread out over a six-hour period
and interrupted by a late-afternoon
hailstorm, was won at 5-8 by
Girven, who continued to jump until
she cleared 6-0——a meet record.
Pitt’s Marie Ribik and Karen
Krichko, both of whom sprang over
5-8 in an informal meet against
Indiana (Pa.) earlier in the week,
ﬁnished third and seventh, respec-
tively.

Pantherette Carmen Scherich
had problems with her footing in the
javelin ﬁnals, where she placed ﬁfth
with a throw of 129 feet. The
previous day’s rain shower had left

the grassy runway in a swampy , ‘
over 100 points.

state. As a result, Scherich, whose

- form relies upon planting one foot

ﬁrmly on the. ground before
releasing the javelin, kept slipping
and could not get off her best
throws.

“There was really nothing wrong
with my throws,” the Pitt
record-holder explained. “I just
kept slipping.” ~

As usual, Penn State dominated
the distance events. winning every
race above the 880-yard run. Lady
Lion Kathy Mills personally ac-
counted for 30 team points by
winning the three-mile run (16:
25.8) and trying teammate Kris

' Bankes in the two-mile run (10:16). _

Mills then anchored the ﬁrst-place
two-mile relay squad, which set a
national record two weeks ago in the
Maryland Invitational.

The remaining three relays (440,
880-medley, mile) were captured by
the Morgan State four-women team
of Tanya Br; ant, Paula Clagon,
Yvette Colman and Paulette
Clagon.

Penn State easily defended its
EAIAW outdoor title by scoring well

running coach Dan Sullivan, one of
the organizers of the meetgstill
sees some good talent coming in to
do battle with the Panther
trackmen.

“We may be missing some of the
big names from past -.mgeets,”
Sullivan noted, “but there is a lot
of talent coming in. There are
some great relay teams visiting
that have already run under 3:10
for the mile relay, which shows

 some of the good performances we

expect to see."

A few of the relays and
individuals Sullivan spoke of are
East Carolina’s and Ohio Univer-
sity’s mile relay squads, both of
which have run a low three
minutes. I
A In. the individual events, Pitt will-
be hosting Penn State AIl-Ameri-
cans Paul‘ Stemmer and George
Malley, who will probably be
running the three-mile and
steeplechase, respectively. In the
sprinting events, East Carolina’s
Carter Suggs will be the man to
watch.

The Panthers also have their
eyes on the Pitt Invitational
watches. too, and they should have
a shot at ﬁrst,-place inimany events.‘
The Panthers, well-rested and with
some good workouts behind them
since being off this past weekend,
should be in tip-top condition for
this year's Invitational. Dan
Goodyear should deﬁnitely be a
threat to win the high jump after
his seven-foot performance at the
Penn Relays. Joining Goodyear in
the high jump is Keith Taylor’ who

Golfers Bogie Finale

By JOHNFINN

The Pitt golf team ended its
spring season in much the same way
it began it-by losing.

The Panthers ﬁnished last in two
invitationals this past week-——at the
Youngstown Invitational on Thurs-
day at the Indiana (Pa.) invitational
on Friday.

Jim Fitzsimmons ﬁred an 82 at
Youngstown to become Pitt’s
medalist, but his teammates didn’t
fare as well as the Panthers were
bested by four teams. ,

Panther captain, Bill Burkardt
who returned to action after an
extended illness, called the Youngs-

W

town course one of the toughest he
had ever played. “The course was
quite long,’.’ he claimed, “with
woods and sandtraps almost

everywhere you looked. ”
The Panthers played slightly

better on Friday at Indiana, but the

competition was much stronger.
The match was won by the hosts,
edging out the Penn State Blue

team for the title. -

“Indiana has a lot of ﬁne ‘
golfers,” Burkardt said, “but they
haven’t playedwellthis year. Today
they put it all together, though.”

Meanwhile, the Panthers ﬁn-
ished a distant sixth despite the ﬁne
play of Fitzsimmons and Jim

and p

 Dan Dattilo.

also will, compete in the triple.

jump. Filling. out the other
jumping duties for the Panthers are
Rich Dolson in the pole vault and
Pete Erins and Don Maydak in the
long jump.

In the weight events, Pitt will
throw Jim Krushin (discus). Mike”
Wallace (shot). Jim Chapin (ham-
mer), JeffnKapp and John Pope
(javelin) into the ring to battle the
.big boys from the other fine
schools.

Pitt's relay team who will be up
their batons in good competition,
 have to come close to setting school
records if they want to place. In the
440-relay, it will be Willie Walker,
Larry Shippen, Keith’Leckenby and
Kevin Carpenter for Pitt. The
same crew will probablyﬁrun the
mile relay, with the exception of
Rich Moore ﬁlling in on one of the
legs. I

In the individual running events,
Panthers Wayne Hursen and Bud
Cooper will run the quarter-mile.
In the usually star-studded half-
mile field, Moore will be joined by
In the distance
events, Pitt’s Tom Herrmann
should be among the top ﬁnishers
in-the mile run along with freshman
Gary Siriano. In the three-mile
run. Panther distancemen Mel
Boyd, Nort McDonald (who will
attempt to join Boyd qualifying for
the NCAA’s) and Mark Studnicki
