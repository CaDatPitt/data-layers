Goes Down To Decisive De-
feat at Hands of Pittsburgh.

CALVIN PUNTS WELL.

By Parker Robinson.

By defeating Penn State on Thanks-
giving Day, 1910, the Pitt Varsity un-
der “joe” Thompson and “Tex” Rich-
ards, piled up a record that stamps
it as the greatest team that ever de-
fended ‘the Gold and Blue. During the
whole season no_t an opponent was
able to cross their goal line. And what
a great ﬁnish it was to beat Penn
State by eleven points! Old Penn was
only able to defeat the home team by
a ten poinlt score. Therefore—but foot-
ball dope doesn"t always work out

that way, so we had better not draw_

any conclusions. At any rate it looks-

as if next year wewould get a chance
to see what we can really do against

Old Penn.

The whole city was wrought up
over ‘the game on Thanksgiving Day.
Everyone talked football and thought
football, and football seemed to be in
the very air. Long before the game
was scheduled to be called great
crowds began to ﬂock to Forbes Field
and the blue and gold of Pittsburgh
was everywhere interspersed with the
blue and white of Old Penn S'tate. The

- fair sex were much in evidence and

the yellow or white chrysanthemums
seemed to be the universal method of
showing their allegiance to one team
or the other.

It was estimated

that seventeen

'thousand people witnessed the game,

and this could not be doubted when
the grea‘t s.ho_ut arose that greeted the
teams as they jogged onto the ﬁeld.
Each team went through a short snap‘
py signal drill, followed by a few trial
punts. Then there was a lull as the
two teamsglined up, Pitt defending the
southern goal and State the northern.
Galvin stanted things going by kick-
ing off to Berry, who returned 7 yards.
Miller immediately punted but the ball
was brought back and Pitt penalized
10 yards. Again Miller punted and

Hittner was unable to get away from
State’s ends for any return. After

“Tillie” Dewar and ‘Brown had failed

Playing Like One Man—~Coach 
Thompson’s ‘ Men Keep Goal

Line Uncrossed For Entire
Season.

STATE NEVER wAv_ERs

By Chalmers Hall.

When Lieutenant Hackett darted
between the two struggling lines of
football warriors and stopped the bat-
tle which had waged sixty long min-
utes and declared Pitt victorious over
State College, a sigh of relief went
up from coach, player and loyal root-
er alike, for Pitt had not only won
but her opponent’s. score was still
nothing.

For many weeks, every Pitt adher-
ent had hoped that the varsity might

go through the entire season with-..

out allowing her opponents to score

and as game by game rolled by_and.

stillpthe white marked goal line re-
mained unmarred by hostile foot-
prints, and as team by team dropped
from the no-score list, until only Pitt
and the Navy were left, intensity
reached fever heat. And now anxiety
is over, hopes realized and we may
look back over our victorious path
whl"ch is strewn with the wreckage of
conquered foes. A

‘Coach Thompson has won the lion’s
share of the praise, for he developed
a wonderful defense and offense--a
defense that was well nigh impregna-
ble in midﬁeld and that stiffened to a
stonewall when the foe was within
striking distance———a defense that was
composed of men who fought stub-
bornly for every inch of ground and
was ever alert to break up a trick
play——-a defense that no team solved.

The same formation was not used
in everv game, as. it was changed to
withstand, to the best advantage, the
attack of the opposftion. In the
State gamethe halfbacks played a
good distance back of the line and
wider apart. The reason for this is
obvious, as State relied on the onside
kick to gain most of their. ground.
This play was not successful once
during the entire game and in the

The Best Team in the Land

 

When the last re-echoing cheer died
away last Thursday afternoon at
Forbes Field, the football season for
the year 1910 was ofﬁcially ended, and
with it came that crowning of all
glory,’ the knowledge that our eleven’

I was the peer of the time honored

rivals from "Penn State. The game
of the day was a crucial tes‘t for our

,.men, for many of the doubters said

We had been forced to face no foe
worthy of our calibre, and that our

‘great reputation would go for naught

if we failed to hold Penn State, but
when the opportunity came to prove

V .our claim‘ for superiority we not only
proved our advantage over State, but

raised the name of the University of
Pittsburgh to such a height that to-
day we are one of 'the headliners in
the rating of the collegeteams of the
country. — »

\The season just ended hasibeen
without a doubt the most successful
in the history of our athletic teams,
even including ‘that splendid record
attained by the sterling team of 1904.
when the “Peerless Leader” was at
the helm in the capacity of captain.
To Coach Thompson belongs the
honor and the praise for producing
one of the foremost elevens in _the
United S'tates; to Captain Richards‘
the glory of being the leader of the
team which stands for the superlative
in University athletics; to the mem-
bers of the team belongs the distinc-
tion of’ being the bone and the sinew
of the machine which has placed the
name of Pittsburgh on the page of
the. book, whichghas for‘,its___le_ngth
and_ breadth the expansion of"this
nation; to the students it is an honor
to know and realize that it is all ours,
not any other persons glory but our

— own, to use and cherish as we please.

To go . through a season with
the line uncrossed is not a new
achievement, but it is not one which
is considered commonplace in the
minds of those who rate the ability
of the team’ work. ’The Blue and
Gold has waved triumphant in eight
games without the semblance of a.
score being made; the nearest the
line came to being crossed was last
week when the players from State
rushed the ball topthe nine yard line,

where the representatives of Pitts"
burgh rallied their strength and re-
pelled the onslaught of the ‘visitors.
When the oval went sailing down the
field, propelled by the mighty boot
of the Center, who is easiy en'titled
to rank with the All—Americans, the
danger was passed for the last time.

It is difficult to write words which
will properly convey‘ ‘the feeling of
elation tha‘t the students are now en-
joying as a result of the deeds on the
gridiron this year, but we are proud,

‘we are overjoyed to the point to utter

in‘toxication inthe thought that we
attained such a commendable reputa--
tion on the ﬁeld of sport. But, in
this spirit of happiness we have not
forgotten our opponents, they who
fought for their Alma Mater as well
as we, ‘to them is attributed the
satisaction of being a_worthy foe and
ﬁghting until the last hope was ex-
hausted. Especially is this true of
the game played last Thursday with
Pennsylvania State College, our rivals,
of old. The men bearing the colors
of the Blue and ‘the White were
players, who deserve much praise for
the effort to keep on working, even
after the hope of realization seemed
lost.

THE SPIRIT OF PITT.

Men of Pitt, where is your spirit?
The appalling force of this ‘question
was brought to ~mind last week be-
fore the State game and on the day
set apart for the celebration of ‘the
W. and J. victory. Last year the word
spirit meant ‘something in this insti-
tution, but this term ‘the laxity of the
students is not even eligible for_com-.
parison over,the excellent efforts of

‘the year gone by. Where does the

difficulty lie, men? It appears to us,
the _,‘crux of 'the whole matter is
reaehediin the sentiment voiced the
other . afternoon in’ the meeting

preparatory‘ to the State game and that

is, we lack studen‘t organization. The
students are so busy, that time is as
scarce as money is with the beggar.
The schedule of the Uuniversity as now
arranged gives very little ‘time for
any outside affairs. To be sure, the
University is not encouraging 'the
numerous student activities in the
form of clubs of one kind or another,
but it should look a little to the spirit
of the institution.

DR. BRASHEAR IS HONORED.

Pittsburgh Scientist Awarded Medal
and Prize by Franklin In-
stitute of Philadelphia.

Dr. John "A. Brashear, the well
known Pitsburgh scientist, has been
honored by the Franklin Institute, of
Philadelphia, which awarded him an
Elliott Cresson gold medal and prize
as a" recognition of his scientiﬁc
achievements. john Fritz, of South
Bethlehem, Pa., is the only other
Pennsylvanian who‘ has been so
honored.

The institute was founded by Benja-
min Franklin. It was formed to pro-
mote science and to recognize scien-
tiﬁc men. '

The Cut System

 

,The current year found a new
system of cuts in vogue inithe Uni-
versity, and at the beginning we re-
frained from comment on the merit
or disadvantages of the plan, because
we were not qualiﬁed to hazard an
opinion. From the sentiment which
is heard here and there from the stu--
dents it is easily possible for the
VVeekly to indulge in a few remarks
from the s'tudent standpoint. First
and foremost, the system is sadly in
need of revision as it now stands. It
is an injustice to place men and
women who are at an age of under-
standing on a basis of High School
discipline to such an extent, that a
professor can, if he ‘chooses, zip a
man for non-at‘tendance of one class.
The old idea was good because it
was fair to the student and the
faculty alike, but this system, the
Weekly takes no hesitation in saying,
is not fair. There are some men,
when elevated ‘to the position of
teachers are willing to-- forget their
humane nature in the attempt to
secure discipline. No allegation is
made in this institution, but is a fac‘t
that men are likely to become alienat-
ed to the workings of their fellow
men when a little responsibility is
placed on their shoulders. We say,
therefore, ‘that a danger exists in such
a scheme where the authority is too
much one-sided.‘ Second, the student

«is entitled to some time, if he can do

his work properly. There are often
cases where an excuse can not be
given for the simple reason that it is
no ones business why absence ‘oc-
curred, meaning, of course, a personal
_cause. In such a case the less said
the better. If a man "feels that he can
take‘ a cut without affecting his scho‘
lastic standing, it is merely a matter
of being just to sanction such an
actiong It is not to be inferred, how-
ever, that We favor a plan which
means the ability to walk out of a
class room whenever inclination dic-
‘tates that way, for such is not, by any
means, our“ point of vantage. There
is a ring of fairness in a plan that al-
lowsfa limited number‘of cuts each
term, that many and "no more.
matter where one wanders a person
will always be found who is looking
toward taking advantage of any mat-
ter regardless of its nature, "and so it
has happened in the past that a few
of these self-same individuals have
made known themselves in the Uni-

'_versity of Pittsburgh, with the result

that ‘the cut system, which was
abused by a certain few was abolished
to make way for a plan wholly in-
adequate for our conditions.

We are honest .in the criticism of
the present cut system and we merely
make these remarks in the hope that
‘the puerile aspects of the method now
in use may be appreciated.

Combined Musical Clubs  
Greeted By Large Crowd

Pitt-State Clubs Perform Most Successfully Before Brilliant Audi-
ence-Dance Attracts Many Leading Society. People-—
Event Should Be Annual Affair.

Thanksgiving evening was a ﬁtting
close to a most eventful day in the
University history when the combined

concert of the clubs
Pennsylvania State College and the
University of Pittsburgh performed
before a large and brilliant audience

in Memorial Hall. As a musical event
the success of the evening was un-
qualiﬁed, the playing and singing be-_
ing the peer of any other concerts
of the “kind held in the ci'ty for years.
The lightingeffects of the gorgeous
hall were broughtginto play with Won-
derful results, especially in the rendi-
tion of “The Gold and Blue,” by the
University Glee club, iwhen the soft
tints of "the golden light intermin-
gled with the rays of blue, descend“

ed from the vast ceiling. Mr. A. P.
Gray, of State College, was exception-

ally strong in solo work, both his
numbers being greeted by tremendous
applause and necessitating encores in
each instance. “The First Concer‘to”
was given an almost perfect interpre-
tation by Mr.  W. Cratty, of Pitts-
burgh, who seemed able to produce’
tones of exceeding rareness on the
mandolin. “Good Bye Sweet Day,” a
cello solo, by Mr. Ralph. Allen,‘ of
Pittsburgh, was played with such
rare ability, that the‘ audience was not
appeased until an encore was given.
The Pittsburgh Mandolin club scored
very strongly when several selections

from “Madam Sherry” were played.
“Rockin’ in de Win,” by Messrs'Mil-

ler, Leyden, Gray and Johnson, of_

State, was a clever piece of quartette

representing '

work. “The Garden of Roses,” sung
by the Pitt quartette never seemed so
beautiful until the rich tones were
brought out so effectively by the
Pi‘ttsburgh singers. The closing num-
ber of the evening was “Hail to Pitt,”

by the combined clubs, and surely it
was well done, even to the rousing

cheers given as a ﬁnale for “Old Penn
State.”

The ball room of the Memorial
presented an animated scene imme-
diately after the concert, with the floor

ﬁlled by an assemblage of beauty and p

perfect appointment, representing
Penn State, the University and friends
of. both institutions. Dancing was
continued until one thirty.

Both Messrs.'»Cunningham and As,‘
kin areentitled to the congratulations
of the student body from the most
excellent conclusion to a superlative
day. Every detail was carefully pro-
vided for, showing an earnest effort
on the’ part of the managers to pro-
duce only the best. It is hoped the
combined concert may be an annual
event for both institutions. The splen-
did spirit» and performance of the
State men is worthy of notice and ap-
preciation. , - --

Galvin punted. On the next play De-
w-ar caught Barrett’s onside kick and
didn’t stop until he had landed it on
ball was brought back and Pitt pen‘
alized. These penalties came often in
the game and cost Pitt many a hard
th-e twenty-yard line. But again the

. won yard. As Barrett at'tempted an"

other kick Dallenback blocked it and,
although a'State man recovered, the
ball ‘was given to Pitt on the 17-yard
line, because the kick had not gone
20 yards beyond the line of scrim-

, mage. Hittner tried an end run but‘

a penalty brought the ball back. A
forward pass on the next play only re-
sulted in another penalty, as Galvin
tried a field goal from the 45-yard

it line. A failure resulted and the ball

was put in play on the 25-yard) line.

‘ Our friend Barrett tried an endrun
‘, but Lindsay broughtihim down for a
. ﬁve'yard loss. An exchange of punts

followed after which .“Tillie” secured
Barrett’s kick and re‘turned l7-yards
to State’s, 30-yard line. Aforward pass

from Richards to Hittner was good

for 23 yards and the Blue and White
team found the ball on their seven-
yard line. Brown netted four yards
on a short end run and Dewar added
two more) But, being over—anxious,

' ‘ .',Brown fumbled the next ball, and if-i't

hadn’t been for Dallenbach, the ball
would have gone to State. Then, with
a‘ mighty effort, Captain Richards
plunged throu-gh center and when the
pile disentangled, the ball was found

0 to‘ be over the line by a ve-ry small
. ‘margin. A great shou't arose from the-

Pitt rooting sut-and and Galvin’s fail-

" ‘.ure to kick goal did not dampen their

ardor to any ‘extent. A 5-0 score
looked good for the game, and every
one felt that Pitt would play it safe
and not take any chances.‘ ‘B

As a resul't a kicking dual followed.
Barrett for State and Galvin for Pitt.
‘Galvin had the’ better of it from the
start, and often got away punts for

55 and 60 yards. Richards and Wagner .
' did the passing when Galvin kicked,

and their work was far superior to
that of State’s “snapper—back” Wat-
son. Sta-te drew two or three penalties
before the ﬁrst quarter closed and
when the referee’s whistle blew, the
ball was in State’s possession on their
40-yard line. 0 A
Noscore was made in thesecond
quarter. The ball was almost always
in State’s territory with State on the
defensive. Quick onside kicks were
used continually and Richards man-
aged to get off two spectacular for-
ward passes, brie to_ Dewar and the
other to Budd, which resulted in good
gains. 
On the 40-yard line Galvin again
made a futile attempt to kick a place-
imient goal and the pun-ting duel con-
tinued. Once in this period State

‘ had a chance to score when a well
i executed forward ‘pass landed the ball

on the -15-yard line, but Pitt’s great
line proved to be a stonewall and the
ball was given to “Joe” Thompson’s
men on downs on their 8-yard line.
The ﬁrst half ended 5-O.

During the intermission the Pitt
students marched around the ﬁeld,
lockstep; headed by Nirella’s band,
and formed a great P in the center of
the ﬁeld. Then -after a hearty" cheer
for Penn. State there was. a wild
rush for their seats.

Rain started to fall in the third pe-
riod, making the ﬁeld muddy, but no
one in the crowd was seen to leave.
’ State played- with desperation in
the third period, determined to “come
back” and make good. Open play
was used much, both sides’ using the

forward pass vvilth more or less suc-g

cess. However, penalties were fre-
quent and were about equal for each
side. Late in this period Wagner was
substituted for Captain Richards, who,
although nursing an injured ankle,
had gamely stuck to his position. It

was an even game during this period

and ended with P.itt’s 42-y-ardline in
State’s possession. Capt. Richards
returned to the game in the last quar-
ter and his. presence seemed to put
new life into ,the whole team. An ex-
change of punts was followed by a
forward pass from Richards to Gal-
vin, which netted .10 yards. How-
ever, a second attempt at a forward
pass put ._the ball in State’s hands.
Miller then made a quick kick to
Wagner, who started down the ﬁeld
with a burst of speed that" left the
whole State team behind. ‘He had
no interference, but he outran /them
all, landing _the ball on the “sunny
side” of the southern goal line for a
second touchdown.
this goal and the score stood ll-0. "

With the game “on ice,” the blue
and gold vars.ity resumed their kick-
ing tactics. With the aid of a forward
pass the ball wasworked to the 20-
yard line, but another forward pass
went to State on their 7—yard line.

Howeve_r,.Quailey, who was substi-,

tuted for Dewar after Budd had gone

in at quarter, made a free catch of:
Barrett’s ,.punt onnthe 27-yard line,’

giving lvin another chance at a
field goal.‘ But agafn he failed. After
an ‘exchange of punts Budd caught
Barrett’s quick kick in the center of
the ﬁeld,‘ and with.Hittner as inter-
ference, ran 50 yards to‘the goal line.
However, the ﬁeld judge construed
Hittner’s interference as illegal, so
the ball was brought back and the
touchdown didn’t count. That was
the disappointment of the game, but
one touchdown, m'ore_or, less, didn’t
make any difference. ’ I

It was one of the greatest battles
ever waged on a Pittsburgh gridiron,
and in the words of Coach Hollen-
bachand Capt. Gray, “the best team
won.” It was not any one man, but
the whole team working together l.”ke
a machine Coach Thompson gives a
great deal of credit for winning to the
ﬁne spirit and harmony that prevailed
among all the members of the team
and claims that Richards is the great-
est captain that ever piloted a blue
and gold team.‘ Summary: '

Statements .of
  Principals in  
Pitt-State Game

 

By Coach Thompson.

“I am more than glad tha't We won.
The secret of the success of the team
is the perfect harmony that existed
between each member of the team.
Captain Gray’s eleven gave us a great
ﬁght, and I feel proud ‘that we de-
feated such a_worthy foe. The vic-
tory pleases me not only because We
downed our bitterest rivals, but be-
cause the team that won was led to
victory by the man whom I consider
the grea'test captain the local team

ever had——-‘Tex’ Ricliards.’’_ ‘

By Chancellor. McCormick.

In a short speech to the players in
their dressing room after the game he
said: “Boys, I am proud of you. The
game you played today was all that

could have been expected. ‘I predict‘
_ that in a very short time Pitt will be

counted as one of the “Big Six” teams
of the country.”
. By Captain Richards.

“This is one of the happiest days of
my. life. Too much credit cannot be
given ‘to State for the stubborn. ﬁght

1 they put up. There is not the semb-

lance of a quintteron the team and
Coach» Hollenback has certainly got

together a great machine.”
By Coach Hollenback.

“I can only say that the best team
won. Coach Thompson has a scoring
machine that ranks wi'th the best in
the country. It is a great disappoint-
ment to me, but—wait ,_until next
year.” -”

By Captain Gray.

“I agree with our coach—the best
team won the game. The Pitt team
is an experienced one, while our back-
ﬁeld is practically new. That is the

reason I think we lost. Coach Thomp-

son is a great one.”~

CLUB

DEBATING
’ BEING ORGANIZED.

Extraordinary Interest Shown.

A body of nearly sixty students met
last Wednesday to discuss ways and
means of effecting a permanent or-

ganization and adopting a constitu-

tion for a University Debating Club.

_The work is in charge of Professor

Fish, and the students are becoming
greatly interested in it. .
Heretofore such of the studen'ts a

engaged in debating were regarded
more or less ‘as martyrs to a good
cause. ’ Such an attitude is extremely
unfortunate, and there is now every
chance of its being remedied. There
is no reason in the world why de--
bating should not be on a par with
the other great and growing‘a.ctiv-
ities of the University students.

Looks like Pitt and Penn next
year. ’ '

THE PITT WEEKLY

Pitt is Superior Eleven
(Continued from page one)

fourth quarter resulted in a touch-
down for Pitt. The onside kick was
State’s chief as.set and they did not
seem to realize until the last quarter
that it was useless against Pitt.

’ It was noticed by many of the root-
ers during the latter part of the game
when the ball was wet and hard to
handle, that a man stood directly
behind the player who caught Bar-
rett’s punts and that this man did not
try to get into the interference. This
was to prevent State from recovering
a possible fumble and is an instance
which s.hows how Coach Thompson
earned the name “Foxy Joe.”

The enemy found it impossible to‘
pierce the Nine, or circle the ends and
men’ playing back of the line broke
up nearly every forward pass and on
side kick that was tried. While every
player showed up strong at breaking
up plays, it is well to remember Capt.
Tex’s splendid open ﬁeld tackles in
the Georgetown, VVes.t Virginia and
State games which prevented sure
touchdowns. Galvin also prevented

.Very from scoring in the State game

when he tackled l13iz'm from behind on
Pitt’s. 12-yard line. '1
The offense, headed by Capt. Rich-
ards, madepersistent gains against
every team that was played and may
be classed with the best there is in
the country. Dewar, Budd and “Tex”
handled punts in splendid fashion and
all were to be counted on in circling
the ends. Hittner was a hard man
to stop and played a defensive game
seldom" equalled in local’ gridiron
achﬁevements, he also headed the in-
terference in an effective manner.
Brown showed his best form running
just outside the tackles and was also
a splendid defense halfback. Wagner,
Q-uailey and Dave Richards did well
whenever called upon and it has been
rumored that the former will be put
at left half next‘ year, while Brown
will try to ﬁll the position vacated by
Tex, but this is mere hearsay. I
It must be remembered, however,
that the linemen deserve as much
credit as the backfield, as their duty,
while not as spectacular, isijust as
important. And while some men stand
out more prominently than others,
the vic-tory was won. by unitedandi
not individual effort. Every player,
regular and substitute, ‘deserves praise
-—every one, from the lineman who
fought with set face and straining
sinews to keep the enemy from mar-
ring the perfect white of that last line
to the back, who plunged recklessly

‘into the line, darted wiifth startling

speed oﬂ? the tackles. or around the
ends, or with measured precision

hurled the ball on its unerring ﬂight;
I demonstration.

into the hands of a waiting team-
mate.-—everyone deserves our praise.
For it was these men who, by stub-
born resistance and dashing runs, that
placed the old Gold and Blue of
Pittsburgh on the topmost pinnacle
of athletic achievement.

The 282. points -amassed by the
team were scored by the following

Many readers will be interested in
some statistics collected from care-
ful accounts taken during our four big
games. The name of the player, the

[number of yards gained from scr;»i,m-.-

mage and the number of downs re-
quired are given under each game.
While in some cas.es, the results seem
large, the‘ reader will remember that
long runs compensate for downs in
which little or no ground was gained.
In case of a forward pass, the dis-
tance gained is given to the man. re-
ceiving the ball; if the pass was poor
and the pass incomplete, a down is
counted against the thrower; if a
good pass is fumbled the receiver is
counted a down. ‘ I

Concerned—No Captain Elect-

The annual banquet of the football
team was, held Thanksgiving nigh‘t at
the Hotel Schenley. The members of
and ‘a number of athletic
dignitaries were on hand, Mr. Hamil-
ton looking after ‘the boys. The cele-
bration was a ﬁtting conclusion to
this, the most glorious season we
have ever had, as it was also the best
ever." Pure, unadulteratedﬁoy reigned
s.upreme, nearly every member of the
team‘ developing n'1ore.or less unex-
pected ability as an actor and general
public- entertainer. In the confusion
attendant on all this hilarity it seems

that serious affairs were forgotten, as
it seems that no captain has yet been
‘elected or letters awarded.

Performs Creditably Before
Students.

The chorus organized by Professor

Berger made its initial bow last Wed- .

ability to read music with great apt-1

ness. The program of the morning
contained two well chosen numbers
for chorus work. the score beingiwell

interpreted in both instances. It is‘

hoped we may have the chorus sing

Berger is entitled to great credit for
the effort to develop a strong organi-

Changes Opinion
0 of Fraternities

 

Dr. Benton Now Thinks College
Secret Societies a Power For
Good. ‘

Retracting remarks which he had
previously made in denunciation of
college fraternities, Dr. Guy Potter
Benton, president of Miami Univer--
sity, addressing a large body of
prominent educators last week, sprang
a distinct surprise by announcing a
complete reversal of his former at‘
titude toward the secret organizations.
He asserted that study of the matter
hadvconvinced him that secret_ so-
cieties cons'tituted ‘a strong arm of
power for the college president in
maintaining institutional ideals.

The occ_asion was the annual meet-
ing of the National Association of
State Universities, and its delegates,
most of whom are college presidents,
represented 42 State institutions.

Dr. Benton some time ago "led a
country-wide campaign against the
college fraternities, as being destruct-
ive of the welfare 0 the college stu-
dent.

Conference Meets

This Week’

University .Men to Speak at Pub-

lic Health Conference Starting A

Yesterday in Memorial Hall.

The "Western Pennsylvania Public
Health Conference opened yesterday
in Memorial Hall with a program of
intense interest. Numerous speakers
of local and state reputation are to
address the sessions held today and
‘tomorrow. Chancellor S. B. McCor-
mick, Dean Friesell, of the Dental
College and Rufus D. Smith, of the
department of Sociology, are on the
program. A large number of students

in the School of Economics and De-

partment ‘of Sociology will attend the
conference as a supplement to class
room work. In some ins‘tances re—
ports are to be made by the students.

All Western Pennsylvania Selected.

In a. selection of. an All-VVestern
Pennsylvania team, Mr. W.‘B. McVick-
er of the Pittsburgh Dispatch, alots six
positions on the first team to Pitt and
five on the second eleven. Peacock and
Budd, of the University eleven are given
recognition on neither team. It seems
to us both men are entitled to repre-
sentation, in as much as their work was
ofsterling quality through the season.
Peacock should be the left end on the
second team, shifting VVagner to full-
back and replacing Munk with Budd.
