Clark McClelland, the U.F.O.

speaker whose contract to lecture at

Pitt was cancelled last week, has

responded to allegations made
against his credentials.

McClelland’s expertise in

research astronomy was first

doubted by Dr. George Gatewood,

P director of the Allegheny Obser-
A vatory. Gatewood scoffed at the
 suggestion that McClelland was the
* astronomer/scientist he claimed to

be.

“He may have looked through
our 13" scopes, but there are no
records.of his work with any of our
other equipment. He’s an amateur,
and they serve a valuable purpose,

’ but it’s not correct for him to claim

that he is a planetary research

a/stronomer.” Gatewood said.
McClelland rebutted with a sheaf

of “documentary evidence” to

make his case. V ’

dividuals involved with these inac-
curacies are very misinformed, ac-
ting out predjudices under the title
of professionalism,” McClelland
said. '

Among letters, memos, and
reprints of documents is a recom-

. mendation from the former director

of the Allegheny Observatory, the
late Dr. Nicolas E. Wagman.

“Clark McClelland... has made
observations, particularly of Mars,
which have resulted in significant
recognition,” Wagman said. '

Another document, a translation
of “Volcanic Activity on Mars” by
G.N. Katherfel’d, a publication of
the Soviet Academy of Science, lists
McClelland as an observer of ﬂare
activity on the surface of Mars.
The credit cites the facilities of
Allegheny Observatory. According
to McClelland, the Voyager, and
Viking missions to Mars have.-
revealed craters in the vicinity of the
ﬂare that may lead to proof of the

sort of volcanic activity he sighted.

Another point of conflict on Mc-
Clelland’s resume concerns his ac-

, tivities at NASA and the Kennedy

Space Center(KSC). McClelland,
in a biography sent to the Pitt Pro-
graming Council(PPC), listed
himself as a NASA aerospace
engineer. - _

According to Joyce Giangarlo,
adviser of the PPC, when she called,
NASA, they had no record of him
other than the rumor that he had
been listed as an exploiter of the
‘agency. é

Later it was found that Mc-.
Clelland was part of a Boeing team
subcontracted by NASA to" do work
on the Apollo Saturn V rocket.

“Even then, he was just a general
office worker, a schedule planner in
the industrial. engineering
division,”A Giangarlo said. »

Once again McClelland answered
with “documentary evidence.”

“These documents support ‘my

background in the National Space
Program as I have claimed in the
promotional material for the .lec-
ture,” McClelland. said. “This in-
formation. will totally refute the
statement in the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette which claimed my employ-
ment history at Kennedy Space
Center was hazy.”

The principle piece of evidence"

McClelland presented was a memo
listing his achievements at NASA
which were the basis of an award
nomination, the ‘Apollo Saturn_ Roll
of Honor- I .

Among his accomplishments
were: A) the design of the Apollo 10
mission symbol; B) preparation of a
booklet to be used as a VIP briefing
guide; C) the design of an astro-
naut memorial; D) “participated
in the development , implemtation,
and operation of the launch com-
plex 39 facility activation PERT
program.” 7 ~

McClelland has also been the
recipient of numerous awards" and

citations, he has been given eight
American ﬂags that went to the
moon, and has received an
autographed photo of John Wayne
for his efforts to procure a similar
ﬂag for him.

“He seems to know an awful lot
of people,” Giangarlo’ said, “but

our sticking point has been his '

claim._that he was an aerospace
engineer-. He doesn’t even have a
degree. What we have here is a great
exaggeration, who knows what we

can believe anymore?”

NIGHTLY SUPERVISORS

Prevention: SureFire Ways to Protect Lives, Property   

By NICK ARNETT/,
Pitt News Staff Writer
Wednesday’s general-alarm fire
at the Saybrook apartments
reminded many Oakland residents
that they should be concerned
about fire safety. Even as fire

  trucks rolled to the Saybrook,

memories of a more tragic fire were
surfacing downtown.

‘ The first day in the murder/ arson
trial of Ernest and Despina Smalis
was coming to a close. They were
the proprietors of the “Chandes R”

Ldisco which burned in 1979, leaving
two dead. In the early testimony,
former tenants called the building a
deathtrap.

What can you do to make your

I apartment safer? What should you
. do

if your landlord won't
cooperate? And the worst situation

 -—v_vhat do you do if your building
_catches fire with you inside? Pitt-
-sburgh‘ Fire Department Battalion

Chief Dave Kratt of .the Fire

V i .Prevention Division explained the
 ‘answers.

Kratt said smoke detectors are a

smart investment. -

‘ ; “The big advantage is that they
[alert people who are sleeping,”
' Krattsaid. “We recommend that
 u ‘they be- installed in a hallway or
.  other area close_to sleeping rooms.

.;They’re also .good for areas’ like
basements‘ which are usually unoc-
'--cupied, where you wouldn't see if a_ .'
_mfi_re broke out.’_" I ‘ ' 2

would require multiple-family
dwellings to have detectors. He said
he.expects it to become law in early
1981.

The fire chief also said it is
criticalthat you be familiar with fire
fighting equipment and‘ escape
routes in your building. He noted
that the Saybrook had two large
staircases and -fire escapes to allow
tenants to escape. However, he

said, no escape route will help you '

if you don't know where it is.

Know where fire extinguishers
are, Kratt said. Know how to use
them, and if they are empty or mis-
sing, ask your landlord to .have
them serviced or replaced. Ex-
tinguishers are required and must
be inspected annually.

Krattsaid that to use standpipes--
the fire hoses on racks in large
buildings--you have to pull the hose

completely off the rack and there.

must be no kinks in the -hose.
Residents at the Saybrook fire said
they tried to use the standpipes, but
couldn’t operate them. However,
firefighters later determined that
the system was working-properly.

There is a trade-off between safe-
ty and security, Chief Kratt pointed
out. If you nail your window shut
or have iron bars on it to keep out
intruders, * you 7 may also trap

. yourself" in a fire, and you will make

it hard for ﬁreﬁghters to rescue
you_ ' ' .- ..

Watch for accumulations of com- , I

bustible materials in or around your
building, ‘Kratt added, He said that
any pile of trash can be carelessly or.
deliberately ignited and; start a
serious fire. Storing materials under
stairways is not lawful--if they catch
fire,‘ “that renders the stairway
useless,” Kratt said. ‘ /-

If you suspect that your landlord
is in violation of fire safety laws,
first ask him or her_ to correct the
problem, according to Kratt. If you

aren’t satisfied, or you need infor- '

mation, -Kratt urges you to call the
Fire Prevention office at 255-2866.
“We will send an inspector to the
premises and he’ll see what is going"
on,” Kratt said. “He’ll try to per-
suade the owner to comply with the -
regulations. If the landlord won't,
he’ll be cited, -which will lead/ to a
legal problem for him.” _ I

“We try to keep close tabs on.

arm to get him to comply. They're -

really a small price.”

In the event you.’re caught in a
burning building, Kratt said to
follow these steps: ' ' " ‘

' 1. Notify the Fire Department if '

possible. . . .h -
2. Notify the other‘ tenants‘ to

New ORL Dorm Policy Stats lndicatellioliaitions Are Dropping  

tis, an ORL staff member, said

By LINDA MILLER
Pitt News Staff Writer

Figures compiled by the Office of

Residence Life (ORL) indicate there

“J were 2,293 visitation violations dur-

ing October, a considerable drop

from the 4,630 violations in
September.

Violations in all residence halls

than 50 percent in October, ORL
assistant director Tim Snyder said.
Lothrop Hall went from 875 viola-
tions in september to 515 violations
in October, a drop of 41 percent
acording to Snyder.
Other ORL figures show that 700
letters have been sent to some of the
.2500 students violating the visita-
tion policy this term. Nick DeSan-

that 42 of these letters were “ad-
ministration summons” or letters
setting up mandatory meetings with
repeaied violators and theiORL.
Of the 42 summons sent, 14 replies
were received, Desantis said".

“This is a "continuing concern‘

that less than half of the students
have responded to the administra-

tion summons,” Snyder said. ‘‘If
they come to the meeting, ‘they
would at least put off or possibly
avoid judicial action.” ~

The majority of the students go-.

ing before the judicial board are
residents of Lothrop Hall, Snyder
pointed out. The reason for this is
that Lothrop Hall, unlike the other

halls, is not physically close to the

ORL, Snyder believes. . ,

The ORL figures conﬁnn that

first, students are starting to.get

used’ to the policy and second, they

are beginning to follow it, Snyder ~
said. With this in mind, the ORL is -. ,
starting to concentrate on in-‘ ‘

By CHRIS CLINTON AND
SCOT STONE

On November 7, Pure Prairie
League performed at the Syria
Mosque. The following is an -in-
terview conducted by

SHOWCASE with band
member Mike Reilly. Reilly
plays bass for PPL and has been
with the band since 1972.

Q: How do you classify your
' brand of music?

A: Maybe countryfied-western-

R&B-Rock and Roll. It's because

of where we're from, the Ohio
"River valley, the midwest, all of

our musical influences were
.there. You had Kentucky and
Tennessee, with their blue—grass,

‘ country and R&B from around

Cincinatti, with James Brown
and Lonie Mac, Rockabilly, the
Everly’s and Jerry Lee Lewis,
and the Rock and Roll from

northern Ohio.

Q: Where do you do most of

your recording?
A: We've recorded in Nashville,
~Toronto, L'.A., and Miami, but
we do most of our recording in
L.A. now. Every town has its
own vibe, you know, when
you're in New York, it's an elec-
tric kind of feel, and in Miami
it's nice because we spend a lot
of time on the water, out in

L.A., it's kind of M-E-L-L-O-W,

man.

The last album we.did was in
L.A., at an industrial park in
Van Nuysl you can probably
hear a tram rumbling as it went
by.

Q: Where is the band going
after tonight?

—?

ALL SHOOK UP
Cheap Trick
Epic

DARKROOM
Angel City
Epic

All Shook Up follows the
same road as last year's Dream
Police: Once America's brightest
hard rock hope, Cheap Trick

A currently sounds tired. As with

Dream Police, All Shook Up

features weak melodies and
songs. Didn't we hear this
before? "Stop The Game"

sounds like ELO while "I Love
You Honey, But I Hate Your

'Friends" lifts from Rod Stewart

and Dave Edmunds. The crystal
clear production of ex-Beatle
play pal George Martin-allows

at

A: Harrisonburg, Virginia, then
we're going home for three big
deal days, and then on out to
L.A. to start rehearsing for the
record. I

Q: Where does the name Pure
Prairie League come from?

A: Pure Prairie League was a
women's temperance union in
an Errol Flynn movie called
Dodge City.

Q: Do you feel
associated 'with the
"Amie"?

A: Sure, it's the one that's ac-
tually most popular, it's been

you're
song

"Ta'll<'ing'Tunes' wmptr. Mme Reilly

out since 1972, and that's what
everybody identifies PPL with.

Q: Does it bother you?

A: No, not really, because I'd
rather have them identify us
with something instead" of
nothing. But then you play
"Two Lane Highway," or "Glat
Top Merle," or "Kansas City
Southern" or "Let Me Love'You
Tonight” and they go "Oh yeah,
PPL."

Q: What was you're first reac-

tion when you first heard one of
your songs on the radio?

Mike Reilly and Pure Prairie League

Countrified—- Western—R€4B—Rock 'n' Roll

Cheap Trick to fall flat on their
face in broad daylight. All
Shook Up is an aural 'Huh?'.

Darkroom is a little better.
Australia's Angel City is on their
second LP so their idea stockpile
hasn't run dry yet. On
Darkroom they plow through
nine songs of varying quality
and consistency with little en-
thusiam and a lot of technique.
Sometimes this approach works
and songs like "No Secrets,"
"Ivory Stairs" and "Devils Gate"
snap. Granted, we've seen all
these moves before but at least
Angel City assembles them dif-
ferently. In fact, ‘Darkroom is
closer in the melodic department
to the In Color Cheap Trick
than the hasty comparisons to
AC/DC. Unlike AC/DC, Angel‘

A: It was a great thrill, you hear
your song on the radio, or you
pull up and hear it blasting out
of someone’s car and you think,
that's what we've been working
for, it's our music.

Q: Where did the character on
your album covers come from?

A: Sad Luke? We got him out of
an old Norman Rockwell
retrospective, he was a model
for Saturday Evening Post, and
he was on more covers than
anyone else, 28 or 29.

I Q: Do you think that other

countries are having more of an
influence’ on music than
America?

A: Not a chance in the world,
this is where the music comes
from, everything else is just

I copy. The whole British thing is

just a resurgence of,.,the 60's

thing..The music for the world _

'_comes out of America.
Q: What is it like being on the
road all of the time?

. A: It's getting old, I don't/like

travelling after 12 years,

everything else I want to do is"

getting further and further
away. I figure after about twen-.

ty years on the road,’ I'm going .

to get off. Things can get out of
perspective sometimes, you get

to feeling that way because all"

you see is buses and airplanes,

- airports, hotel rooms and—-gym-
nasiums. It's getting kind of not

worth it anymore.

I Q: "Do you want to become rich

and famous?

A: No ' fame, fortune’ ‘and
Hollywood for us, but we've got
our following built up and we're

happy to be ‘paid for doing _
‘something we like. A '

~ TWICE,NIGHTLY

City. has pop aspirations.
Darkroom, like Angel I City's
"first, is marginally interesting
but not recommended unless
you've got extra money.

Will Cheap Trick hang it up?

Will Angel City find success in-

the Bigtime? ‘

There lies a deceptive mysticism

in Elton John's new album.

However, it's all in the title,‘

Feydeau’s Frolicking Farce .

DON'T WALK AROUND

~ STARK NAKED/THE BALD

, SOPRANO
Written by George
Feydeau/ Eugene Ionesco
Directed by Mark Masterson
Theatre Express

By ].D. KLEINKE'

Upper-class frivolity is the

» touchstone of two French farces
currently on the Theatre'Express
stage. Propelling often petty,
and always ludicrous situations
to an intolerably exaggerated ex-
treme, the one-act plays reflect
their subject matter in full.

' _‘Whimsical story-lines, seeming-

fly trifling, are driven miles

‘ » beyond reality, their characters

prone to sardonic back-biting

Z} _’ with a‘ seething wit.

.On stage, these elements are

 1, in key. The cast heightened and
 beleaguers the frolicsome situa-
.. Ag tions with an i

nsanely credible
sincerity. - ‘

is exhausting to watch, much
less perform. The pacing,
unflinching in its breakneck col-
lision course towards complete
absurdity, hammers home its
ridiculousness with a tasteful
flair. Filling the stage is a‘ cast of
five, all simultaneously envelop-
'ing character and storyline, all
hilariously. The image is color-
ful and side-«splitting. L
The Bald Soprano plays the
opposite fiddle. Are the English
boring? According to Ionesco,
intolerably so. But staging the
idea, of absolute boredom
without being in itself_boring is a .
delicate process. But where the
plotlis one of unending tedium,
Masterson's staging convenient-
ly slips above its subject matter.
Indeed, drabness is on stage, but
it is a punchy drabness. The
play takes numerous plunges in- ’
to the depths of theme,
tempered with a noticeable trace
of profundity. But still,

and . terminally rib-tickling.

by an invigorating cast brim-

timacy of the actual theater also
lends the farces an addtional ele-
ment; the pace is amplified, and
the energy, multiplied to infinite
proportion. -
The experience proves ex-
hausting, but loads of fun.

which simply means twenty-one
albums at‘ age (thirty-three.

There's nothing, deceitful‘ about r.‘
the rest of the album. In fact, the
truth is rock—'s Liberace seems to J

have recovered from his post-
Captain Fantastic slump. V
Elton's been through some
hard times in the past five years.
His band walked out on hi-m,
Bernie Taupin,—stopped writing
lyrics for him, and his admitted
bisexuality seemed to affect his
popularity some. The total
result was Blue Moves} and A

Single Man. Two very mediocre

albums that. received a -very
mediocre response. ’ ‘

Yet, things seem‘ to __ have ..
changed -on this album._‘Nigel .
Olssen and Dee Murray of the '

old band are back, Taupin is
writing more ‘lyrics, and Elton

seems to be his .vibrant. self," ,

again. . .

The album is polished, easy to
listen to, and definitely Elton.
One can hear influences of

' Honky Chateau and Rock of.,the

Westies on suchlcutsas "Little
Jeannie," "Dear God,’-’ "White
Lady ‘White Powder," and the

. autobiographical _ "Two Rooms

At The_End Of The World"
which rehashes the break-up
and reunion ,of Elton and
Taupin as a songwriting team.

Despite the magic of this hit- '-

writing duo, the album's best_
cuts, "Sartorial Eloquence,” and
”Never Gonna Fall l_n ~ Love

. Again” were written? by the
underrated genius of Tom .‘

Robinson ("Glad To Be"Gay"’).
These two songs leave a biting
impression on the listener with
their masked frankness.

Overall,_2fl AT 33 can be con- -

sidered an excellent come-ba_‘cl_<

-album for Elton John. His talent I

is far from ‘expended and this

be a toaster or something like
that,” Yuille said.

“Then we went down to see what
it was and we saw flames coming
out of the closet. It was a mattress
on fire in thestorage closet. We
tried to use the extinguishers and
they wouldn’t work. We tried to

use the hoses, but they wouldn’t V

come on,” she said.
When we saw the fire, we had to
go to the gas station one block from

_V here to call the fire department,”

Yuille added. “There were no
alarms inside the building. Nothing
in the building would put the fire
out; it was just pathetic,” said
Yuille. .

Battalion Chief Dave Kratt of the
city fire department’s Fire Preven-
tion Bureau, said the cause of the
fire is under investigation. He
acknowledged that it did start -inthe
closet as Yuille alleged.

“We’ve got nothing concrete
yet,” Kratt said. “It appears as
though it might have been acciden-
We haven’t found anyone yet
who had a motive to set the fire.”

There were 60 units
building, of which fifty were oc-
cupied. ‘Twelve of those-on the
fifth floor ‘and four on the fourth
floor were destroyed. The rest of

‘the building suffered extensive

water damage because _of the heavy

lines used on the fire, Kratt said.
“We have no reason yet to call it

‘suspicious’. We found nothing like

a disgruntled employee or tenant"

who might it,”
Kratt added. . g A

Deputy chief John Harpur said
the firemen concentrated on saving

lives rather than fighting the fire in-

have started

in the '

itially, which gave the fire a head
start.

“We had firemen on all floors
and going to every door. This was
our first concern before we could
do anything else with the fire...that
everyone was out,” Harpur said.

One Pittsburgh firefighter, who
asked to be left nameless, said, “By
the time we got in, and found out
where the fire was spreading from,
it had reached the __roof. It was in
between walls. And then there’s the
thing about the storage closet that it
supposedly started from...it was
near an elevator shaft, so it could
have climbed through there. I’m
not sure. You’ve got to search for it
(the fire), andby the time you final-
ly open up the walls, there's no
quick way of stopping the
spreading.” _ A

According to Doris Somerfeld, a
disaster worker for the American

Red Cross, about 60 people were af- ,

fected by the fire, and the Red
Cross has seen 37 to 40 people at
their downtown service center.
Most of them have lost everything
they owned. . ‘
“I just felt like I worked for
nothing,” said Albert “Abe”
James, on of the fourth floor tenant
in the gutted building. “I’m not
really positive I’m staying.” A '
James, 24, was at a friend’s
house when his girlfriend called him
from work to tell him that their
apartment building was on fire.
“They’re not going to pay me for
my furniture. I lost a little over two
grand. I didn’t have much. I was
living in an ‘efficiency...I’m just
wondering if they (Gold and Co.‘
Realtors, the ownerslof Saybrook)
will find me another apartment. I

talked to Gold, and he really didn’t

want to say anything,” James said.

At press time, Pitt’s Office of
News and Information and the Red
Cross were compiling a list of Pitt

\
students affected by the fire. The
two organizations are tentatively
planning a book and clothing drive.
Sharon and Lori Brinsko, two
sisters who shared an apartment in
the 100-year-old building said they
may only have to contend with
smoke and water damage from the
fire.-
“I was just on my way home and
I heard a 4-building complex was on
fire in Oakland and I just knew it
was mine and ‘I was coming up the
Boulevard (of the Allies) and I saw
it was mine,” said Sharon, a nurse.
The Brinsko sisters had planned
to move out of Saybrook in a
month. Lori, a student at the Art
Institute of Pittsburgh, and her
sister /Sharon are both from
Vandergrift, Pa. They said they saw
no safety problems at Saybrook.

“As of now, I don’t know what I

have,” said Frank Tarasi, another

resident. “As far as I know, I’ve
got blinds. I figure if the fire was in
my apartment the blinds would
definitely go, but the last time I
checked they were still there. I got
blinds, but come to think of
it...none of them work, as a matter
of fact.’’. '

Tarasi is a Pitt graduate student
in the university’s forensic
chemistry program. '

“When I left for a class, it
»must’ve"been 5 minutes after 4.

When I came back, she was a candle
in the night. -All we can do is hope
and pray. As long as no one is
seriously hurt, that’s the main
idea,” he said. = '

Tarasi, who was waiting in one of .

the emergency shelter areas for his
parents to pickhim up, said, “I

guess you can say I’m optimistic. _

I’m going home to spend the night

"with my folks out in Kittaning(40

miles "north of Pittsburgh); I’ll. be
back up here sometime tomorrow
to take alook.”

Panthers Take Road Sow to Ay

By JEFF. DUROSKO
Pitt News Sports Editor
Going into .tomorrow’s game

against Army, the Panthers have to .

 , face more than one foe. Not only

will Pitt have to contend with the
Cadets on the field of play, but the
Panthers also have to keep from

. concentrating more on what bowl

 vitations, can be extended, coach ‘

they’d like to go to than the play at
Michie Stadium.

jWith tomorrow being the day
that official post-season bowl in-

Jackie Sherrill has been working all
week to keep his teams’ minds off
the trips to places warmer than
West Point, New York. 9

‘‘We’re in a position where we

' need some help but we’re still hop-

ing for a New Year’s Day bowl in-

vitation,” Sherrill said earlier this

week. “It probably, though, won’t

_ be decided until the outcome of

\

Saturday’s games are known.- Our

2‘ job this week ,will be defeat Army

and then we’ll worry about the bowl
invitations after the game.”

The Panther coach added that .

the team will be playingthe game
on the ﬁeld rather than a bowl game
in their minds because of last
week's not-so-great‘ performance
against Louisville.

“When out players look at the
films of Louisville game and see
how poorly they played, I know
,they’ll want to come” back and play
well against Army this Saturday,”

. said Sherrill. “I’m really not very

I s  satur¢=v,¢9a:,"s'

  

 

happy about the way we played last
week. We should have controlled
the ball more and done a better
job.”

In addition, Sherrill is not taking
the Cadets too lightly and hopes his
team is doing the same.

“Army played extremely well in
its victory over California (26-19)
and has gotten stronger as the
season progressed,” said Sherrill.
“I’m impressed with their quarter-
back. He is similar to (Oliver) Luck

_ in that he can scramble and he has

thrown for over 1,000 yards and is

        
     
       
 
        
     
    
     

I

    
   
 

. also one of the leading ground

gainers.”

That quarterback, Jerry! Ben-
nett, has completed 70 of 144 passes
‘for 1,016 yards and six
touchdowns. He is a rollout,

option-style quarterback and is the
second leading rusher with 189

One of the most important
aspects of the Pitt-Army game

tomorrow‘ is that bowl bids will be

delivered following the contest; If
the Panthers are able to continue
their winning ways, a major bowl is

still a slim possibility. Here is a.

quick look at what couldhappen.

Sugar Bowl: The Panthersseem
to have no chance here. Number

one Georgia should win'it’s remain- .

ing games and thus be the host team

in_ New Orleans. Their opponent_

would seem to be the winner of this
week's Alabama,-Notre Dame
igame. This is the only bowl which
seems fairly certain. ’
Orange Bowl: "Pitt’s chances are
better here, probably, the ‘best of
three majors. However, it does de-
pend on the Alabama-Notre Dame’

contest. There have been rumours A

mains is why take the Irish-Tide

diminish the prestige of possibly

With USC on probation and Ohio
State (if they beat Michigan) com-

_’mitted to the Rose Bowl,’Pitt would

be next in line. Keep your eyes open ,
for the Orange Bowl.

Cotton Bowl: Florida State will
probably go here to play the pro-

would go here is if Florida State

Strasser Advances to Nationals In Was

By MARIE HUFF

Pitt freshmen have found a place

.«f_‘ for themselves in the record books

_;r-

over the years. Names like Tony
Dorsett and Danny Marino are
among the most recent entries.
Well, move over gentlemen, here
comes Valerie Strasser. Strasser
not only etched her name in the
record books, but she made
history’, becoming the first Pan-
therette to qualify for the National
Cross-Country Meet.

Strasser’s accomplishment came
on Nov. 1, in the’ Division II
Regional Championships at Indiana
University of Pennsylvania. The

" freshman‘ sensation was among, the

top fifteen harriers to advance to

Swimmers

The Eastern "Champion Pitt
Swim Team opens its 1980
season tomorrow against Big
Ten Champion Indiana Univer-
sity. Indiana is coached by the
internationally famous Doc
Counsilman, and is a perennial
national swimming power. It
will be the first time the two
teams have ever swam against
each other. I

The Panthers will be led by
Eastern Champions‘ Stu Swan-
son (200 backstroke), Sandy
Pidgeon -(200 Breast), Pat
Greenwell (diving). and Rick
Carter (sprint freestyle), along
with Eastern Finalists Scott
Shearer, Jeff Trew, and Greg

the Nationals to be held at the
University of Washington this
weekend. Strasser covered the 3.1
mile course in 19:34, finishing 13th
in a field of 85. I
“This is a comeback of sorts for
me,” said Strasser. “I fell apart my
senior year in high school.”
Strasser competed for Wallen-
paupack High School on the track
team for four years, and as- a
member of the cross-country squad
for three. Strasser immediately
established herself as a top-notch
runner, advancing to the state
“cross-country finals all three years.
Strasser came home with medals
(given to the top 20 finishers) twice.
Her sophomore year she garnered a
ninth place medal and came back

her junior year to finish twelfth. As
Strasser says, she fell apart her
senior year, dropping out of the top
20.

In staging her personal come-
back, Strasser led the revival of the
Panterette cross-country squad.
The sport dropped out of existence
last year due to a lack of funds.
Back in operation, the seven
member unit, which consists of
juniors Margie Lee and Melanie
Nickerson, sophomores Sally Hig-
gins and Terry McKee, and
freshmen Barb Mischler, Patty
Ricalton, and Strasser, let them-
selves be heard.

Strasser, a biology major, credits

her teammates with much of her
success.

Open Against Indiana

freshman are also expected to
help out Pitt’s cause.

“We’ve been training hard
since the first week of
September,” said Shearer, “and
I know I speak for the team as
well as myself that we’re looking
forward to swimming a high
calibre team like’ Indiana to pro-
ve that all of those morning and ‘
afternoon _.practices have paid
off for us.”

“Overall I feel that" this season’

has been my best at Pitt,” he said.
“It’s my last vear of competitive
running and I have put a lot into it,
I"ve been having two workouts a

Last season Bailey had some
obstacles in his way when he ran the ,

course. He ended up 110 out of a
field of appproximately 250 tun-

saw the best race of hislife.

“Since we didn’t run any home

that I could have improved on that

the best) against the number one
