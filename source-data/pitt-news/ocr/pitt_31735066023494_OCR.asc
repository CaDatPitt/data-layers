ed by the Student Government
Board at Tuesday’s" meeting. .

Allocations Chairman Kerry
Warren said the Commuter Affairs
Committee, sponsor of the Com-
muter Banditprogram, had been
allocated $150 for use during the
fall/winter period. However, the
committee lost half of its allocation
because the none of the funds were
used during the fall term.»

Warren explained that the com-
mittee did not realize that it had to
use some of the money during the
fall. As a result, the committee had
been left with only $75 for their
Commuter Bandit program.‘

The Commuter Bandit helps out
commuter students by inserting ex-
tra money in parking meters where
the time has almost expired.

The board also approved an
emergency allocation of $30 for the
Allocations Committee. Warren

' said the money would be used to

pay for refreshments served during
budget ‘deliberations with student
organizations.

board agreed to a modification in

modification asked for additional
money for space rental fees for the

Warren announced that the

The bill had originally been in-
troduced by state Senator James
Kelly (D-Westmoreland) in
September, 1979.

This bill’ will make the student,
who pays the test-taking fee, the
“client” of the Educational Test-

college or professional schools who

- receive the scores, said Tom Cohen,

a member of PGR.

Truth in testing legislation re-

Opposition to President Jimmy ,

Carter’sicall for registration for the
draft\will be in full force this Satur-
day in Washington D.C., when a
national march and rally against the
draft is planned, in front of the
Capitol building, with the hope that
Congress will see the wide-spread
opposition to peace-time registra-
tion.

The National Mobilization
Against the Draft, a Washington,
D.C. based national and regional
coalition of anti-draft groups, is the
sponsor of the march and rally. The
organization is an effort that came
together two weeks after President
Carter’s State of the Union A_d-
dress, 'with the single purpose of
organizing Satu'rday’s march, ac-
cording to Patrick Lacefield, pro-
jectgcoordinator of the group.

‘,‘We wantedto pull together a

march- ~'as-T v soon“-“as.«possible,-?’? *»

Lacefield said, "as a quick response
to "Carter’s proposals: ’ ’

“We’re intending to tie toge_ther
all the local anti-draft organiza-
tions, put pressure on Congress,
and make it clear to the politicians
that the draft" is a political
quagmire,” Lacefield added.

The Pittsburgh chapter of the
Committee Against Registration
and the Draft are the local
organizers of the march, providing
round-trip bus transportation to
Washington D.C. for the one-day
affair.

The anti-draft‘ movement in its"
early days, being capable of

.mobilizing a national movement,

indicates what the future will be like
if registration is passed, according

to’Tom Onieal, head of the Pitts- -

burgh chapter of_ the Committee
Against Registration and the Draft.
“We have to get people to under-

gain and politicians are generally

“When Onieal was asked for his

reaction to the ‘recent Student.

Government Board resolution
favoring the draft, he said that the
survey used to poll students was as
accurate as could be expected, but it
was “dated” because the survey
had been taken very shortly after
Carter’s State of the Union Add-
ress, “when very few facts were
available.” -

If the survey were taken today, it -
would reflect a smaller percentage
of people in favor ‘or registration,
Onieal added.

But Onieal went on to say that

scoring are occasional, noted Ep-

pehimer, this provision would pre- i

vent error by allowing students to
look into questionable scores. '

Eppehimer acknowledged that
the bill is far from becoming a law
and added that Pitt’s groupis the‘

first to do any major lobbying for

the legislation. E

“It may take awhile for the bill ‘ 

to go through, but the initial effort

will be there,” she added.

Everything students "learn in col-

writer for NBC-TVs “Saturday

Speaking to a near-capacity
crowd in the Schenley
ballroom, Beatts realted her ex-

She posed the question to the

Could you imagine?...‘Well I think
the deal’s sewn up, Ted. Just one
thing, can you name a benevolent
despot?’ ‘Frederick the Great of
Prussia?’ ‘Right! You’ve got the
job at the asbestos plant.’ ”

In the course of an hour and 45

' minutes, she entertained the crowd

with answers to many questions‘
concerning the “Saturday Night”
cast and the organization of "the
show. “She also told the audience

for student‘ affairs, he added.

The current SGB by-laws and
constitution state’ that the pur-
pose of the SGB is to promote
the concerns, interest and
welfare of all undergraduates,
according to Abraham.

When the by-laws were writ-
ten, the board believed it was

Beatts. “You see, I live in New

told me that he didn’t have trouble

“The intent was to exclude _
CGS students,” Abraham said.
“However, if the by-laws are in-

students are included.’ ’

So far, no CGS students serve

déngncommittees, Abraham add-

If the new by-laws are approv-
ed by the board, Abraham said,

“The other night, I was in a
friend’s apartment. I was waiting
for him to come and I had his key
and he didn’t. So I had to let him
in. But I was really tired and I
wanted to take a bath. But I didn’t
want to get out of the tub to let him
in. So, I decided to leave the door
open, which was risky thing to do.
Because it was New York City, and
even though there was a doorman
downstairs, there might’ve been a
mugger or a rapist in the building.

“So anyway,” she continued, “I
put a sign on the door that said, ‘If
you’re a mugger or a rapist, please

do not enter.’ And I left the door
open and Igot in the tub and I

thought, ‘I don’t care if I am mug-
ged or raped, it would be worth it

for the joke.’ Imagine the report.

on tomorrow’s six o’clock news.
‘Ironically enough, she posted a

sign on her door...’ .

_ “Before I got out of the tub, I
did a terrible thing—_I picked my
nose. And I started thinking, ‘If
somebody comes in now, ‘please,
Lord, let it be a mugger or a rapist,
but not him (her boyfriend).’,”
Beatts said. .

Underworld Rolling In (Pizza)

infiltrated pizza and cheese

and cities, committing arson‘and
murder and costing governments
millions of dollars in lost tax

Pillows. Carpet Put Finishing Touches On Dorm Rooms  

By WALTER R. WATSON
Pitt News Staff Writer

(Editor’s note: This is the third
and final part of a series on interior
design and ways of improving small
living spaces.)

In the first two parts of this
series, interior designer Dave Farrar
gave advice on choosing a color for
the room’s walls, making lighting
work for your room, and picking
artwork for the walls that best
represents your personality. Farrar,
national home furnishings coor-
dinator for Montgomery Ward &
Company, wound up the interview

with The Pitt News discussing the -

finishing touches that can make a-

room as unique as the student who
lives in it. . . 
“Decorative ﬂoor pillows give
comfort and -are real kickers. They
set the room off. They can be mov-
ed to anyplace in the room and
make a simple seat that can keep the
overall appearance of a room neat,

without making the room into a-

‘hands-off’ area,” Farrar said.

He said that throw pillows should
be chosen with consideration of
how comfortable they are, as well
as how attractive they are.

“-You don’t want to buy
something that is only good to look
at. It’s an investment and it should
be a functional one. Maybe you see

a tapestry design on a pillow that
you like, or an avant-
garde—whatever suits your taste,
Farrar sai_d. _

“The last investment to make is
in a floor covering. Carpet tiles are
nice. Keep the color scheme
monotone. If you don’t, it will
decrease the size of the room. There
are a number of ways to arrange
carpet tiles in your room. Just make

sure that the arrangement you»

choose doesn’t cut the size of the
room, unless it’s desireable”. You
may want to decreasethe size in one
direction, but increase it in another,
Farrar said. ,

“After the flooring is done, you

have a room that says ‘you.’ It’s
special and becomes special because
of the time and money-you’ve put
into it. You may spend between $85
and $100 when you’re done, but
look, everything in your room,_ ex-
cept for the paint on the wall (Pitt
News, Mar. 14) can be removed.

The lighting, , the pillows, the
plants", the artwork, even the carpet
tiles, can be taken out when you’re
ready to move. The only investment
you’ve -left behind is the $10-$12
gallon of semi-gloss or high-gl_oss
paint,” according to Farrar.

Farrar explained briefly what he

nishings coordinator.

conductinterviews. If a student’s
application is accepted, it will be
passed on to the Institute of Inter-

The application then willbe sentgp

Since competition is stiff, it is ad-

3.50 Q_.P.A. Otherwise, the student
must prove in the proposal the field

I   Reexamining  
  Priorities

We have heard students express their dissatis-
faction with the education they are receiving here at
the University of Pittsburgh. _ -

We heard students protest last year when the Alter-

_‘ native _ Curriculum program was terminated and
again this year when the Self-Designated Major pro- .

gram faces a similar demise. More recently, we have
seen university support dwindle in the younger
departments at the university, like Black Studies.

The progressive academic movement characteristic
at many major universities during the late sixties and
early seventies is dying at Pitt. V

One of the administration’s reasons for these cut-
backs and similar ones is the lack of funds, apartially
defensible line of reasoning. However, programs be-
ing cancelled or crippled by funding cuts seem to be
in areas that have not reached their full potential.

Further, we are seeing policy changes and pro- -

grams that could be developed-but are _,not—directly
hindering the quality of student life. _

The bottom line is that Pitt students deserve a lot
more than what they are currently receiving in their
educational package from the university. '

What they have received‘ _in return for their
precious tuition dollars are promises of a drastic cur-

   Elliiziiﬁitt News

AW,

 Page 6-Wednesday," March 19, 1980"

riculum reform that will aid, not hinder, promises of T
an overall better life for students. ' .

But, based on its past performance, it is quite ob-
vious that theadministration is lightning fast when it
comes to taking away; but not nearly so when it
comes to giving. ,

It was with seldom-seen speed that a proposal to
limit the students rights to 24-hour visitation in the
residence halls was drafted and passed, while it has
taken all of twelve years to find a suitableproposal to
renovate the sadly dilapidated Student Union.

Whatever happened to that proposed proiggt
anyway? Has it been lost in the bureacratic shuffle
or rejected because of the needed funding to initiate
the project? No one knows but the administration,

- as of yet, they have not told the students.

The Student Union renovation project is but one

‘example of exciting projects introduced to_ the stu-

dent ‘body only to later disappear without a trace.
It takes the university so long to act on policies or
projects that could enhance a student’s stay ‘at Pitt,
but such little time to destroyor severely handicap
already existing policies and programs that benefit

_ students.

The university needs to reexamine its priorities and
methods of operation. Continued cutbacks and lack
of innovative programming to enhance student life,

serve both_ to frustrate students already enrolled at Q.

Pitt, and will surely discourage prospective students
from enrolling in the university.

Our first reaction was, “Who is
Stephen Wohl?” Our second reac-

' tion was that whoever he is, he is to

be pitied. Anyone with the naivete.
displayed in this guest column has
to arouse some feeling of sympathy

and compassion in the reader.

His ignorance of actual condi-

«__:'.tions in USSR and its satellites is
' abysmal and his comparison about

_‘ the living conditions of the people _

in the USA and the “superb”<:on-
ditions in ‘the USSR is nauseating. »

Since living conditions in Russia are
so great, please explain to us why so
many people are willing to risk
everything to get out? Also, why do
they have to build walls, man them
with machine guns, use killer dogs
and all "kinds of devious methods to

when treated as a special visitor,
would soon find out what is behind

to mention the International Room

recommend they spend at least a

Frankly, we would rather get our
information from Alexander
Solzhenitsyn who knows first-hand
what it is like to live under Com-
munism. Just in the university com-
plex alone, we have enough people

take his chances in the USSR.‘ It is
as simple as that. In case he is pen-

After reading Stephen Wohl’s
commentary, “U.S. Withdrawal

know that Shangri-La does exist.
I’m glad Mr. Wohl has shownkme
the “real truth” and will lead the

Show me the way Mr. Wohl, by de-
nouncing your association with this
decaying and dying capitalistic
America, and defect into the arms
of Mother Russia. Shun this socie-
ty, Mr. Wohl,_ and follow the
“true”'words of"‘The Little Red
Book.”

But if you don’t have the convic-
tion or thepurity to defect Mr.

Mr. Burke, you amaze me! In
fact you amazed me so much by
your letter March 17, that I almost
choked on my oatmeal‘ raisin

cookie. How could a defenseless, _/

innocent oatmeal raisin cookie
almost do that to me? I"

Well, when SGB came out sup-
porting Carter’s proposal for draft
registration I cursed myself into a
red, heated rage. Mr. Burke, I
wanted to personally sign your

You avoided Mann's, Kane’s,

tions are put to you: What is “a
representative sampling of Pitt
Students?” How many students
were surveyed? How was the sam-
ple chosen? What" questions were
asked? Where and when was the
survey taken?

And Mr. Burke, I’m sure that if
the resolution stated neither’ posi-
tion, the SGB wouldn’t be receiving
critical comment from any side.
This brings up Mark Galper’s ques-

I tion again: doeslthe SGB feel it ap-

Finally, that melodramatic line
about people not expressing their

apply here. I dug in and tried to
shape the outcome by voicing my

Not surveyed

Right to

Criticize

I believe I must defend against
Walter Burke’s illogical attack on
the letter-writers criticizing the SGB
resolution on the draft. (Pitt News,
March 17.)

Burke makes several points in his i_

letter: , _
l) The letter-writers were “never
in on a (SGB) meeting, never in the

known.” The only thing "that may
be concluded from this is that SGB
resolutions are intended for only
those who attend their meetings.
The fact that this excludes at least
95 percent of Pitt’s population is
ignored by Burke.

2) He also asks if the letter-
writers filled out one of the survey
forms. With this question, Burke
perverts the entire science of poll-
taking. The public does not request
to be in a poll, they are randomly
asked to participate. The question
thus arises if the SGB “survey” was
random (i.e.-—valid) at all...

3) Finally Burke rhetorically
asks, “Why do people express their
opinions after‘ the fact?...Arm-
chair quarterbacks are a dime a
dozen.” In other words, we should
have voiced our criticism before the
SGB resolution is passed (quite a
feat in itself.) Furthermore, once
passed, the issue is closed. ’A;’tad

”authoritian, even SGB standards.

I do not mind if the SGB and

the letter-writers disagree on fun-

damental issues. However, Burke
seerns upset over our very right to
criticize. V , I’ll not stoop so
low—Burke may be incompetant,

free speech. '1
Mark Collins, CAS

SGB Survey
Called Valid I

This is to thank the student body
for their interest concerning SGB’s
resolution on the registration for
the draft. However,,I feel a respon-
sibility to clarify our position on the
matter._

Contrary to the opinion express-
ed' (misrepresentation): the SGB
survey, which was conducted
February 25 to March 4, was a
statistically valid crossection of 710
students from CAS, Engineering,
Nursing and the other under-
graduate schools. To supplement
this, a random sample was taken in
the Cathedral of Learning, the Stu-
dent Union, and’ the Litchfield
Towers.

The survey questions sought the
students’ opinions concerning: 1)
President Carter’s move to reinstate
registration for the draft; 2) the
President’s plan to register men and
women, 19-20 years of age; 3) the

% nion:

 Unsurveyed SIudentFinds SGB Response ‘Amazing’

women from combat; 4) volunteer-

ed; and 5) resisting the draft. The
results were published
Wednesday’s Pitt News. _

The ﬁgures show that the majori-
ty of students questioned are for
Carter’s move to reinstate the
registration for the draft. However,

there is'a slight margin opposing his -

plan of registering men and women,
ages 19-20. Is the opposition to the

male/ female participation or to the _

age bracket? The ﬁgures also show
that of the studetns having an opi-
a majority would‘ not
volunteer for the Armed“Services,

v ing for the Armed Services if need— 

in last‘ I

but would not resist a formal drafts’

Does this mean that a mandatory‘

registration is a necessity? A
Finally, the only “long-standing

SGB policy” is it’s constitution,

and it states\ no constraints on SGB '

taking stands on political issues.
Our stand is a decision derived from
fact, not a subjective view of how
loud people cheered at the forum.

Further information can be ob- I

tained through me and the SGB of-
free. ' I

Rehiring of Grgurich —— ‘Any Big Decision to Make?’

OPEN LETTER TO
CAS MYSLINSKI

I’ve chosen this forum to speak
out for the first time on the current
basketball dilemma for the reason,
first, that I am directly involved and

I I have paid my dues for this privilege,

and second, because I genuinely feel
that it is imperative that my opi-
nion, reflected also ‘by legions of
loyal Pitt people, be aired publicly

3. rather than by private cor-

\

respondence. For that reason I
know you’ll forgive my approach.
Now that the few who represent
Tim Grgurich’s detractors have had
their shot at “improving” Pitt’s

basketball scene, to its detriment;

and now that’ a commitment ap-
pears to have emerged; and, now
that we’ve learned that the “‘best”
we could get was a coach who, with
superior talent, could do no better
than split with a coach we now seem
to want to pass off as a “loser”;

I Legal Awareness Column-

and, now that we are on the verge
of making a horrible mistake in
replaping Grgurich, SOLELY for
the sake of replacement, with a
totally untested and unknown
quality:

NOW, Cas, don’t you think it’s
about time that you assert your
authority and retake the reigns of
decision-making before it’s too late
to save a program which needed on-

which you now appear ready to im-

Questions?

The Legal Awareness Commit-
tee, composed of undergraduate
students, seeks to aid Pitt students
with their problems, ranging from
arrests to «parking tickets. Because
students often lack sufficient
knowledge of their rights, an opera-
tional Legal Awareness Committee
is a necessity. Few student organi-

I .zations can offer the type of service

offered by the Legal Awareness
Committee, coupled with the prac-

‘ tical -experience and education

available to itsrmembers.

The Legal Awareness Committee
services cover a wide range of legal
problems within "the University
community. The Committee re-

ﬂtains alaw firm who will advise and

assist students. Most of the refer-

’ ‘_ rals to the attorney consist of in-

plement, such as was the case in
1972 when you launched Pitt’s new
football era?- At that I time you
replaced a laser with a winner in a
losing program. In 1980, you have a
winner who deserves the opportuni-
ty to improve upon his own
achievem‘en-ts. ‘

Tim Grgurich need not prove his
worth to Pitt——Pitt has an obliga-
tion to recognize his worth to Pitt.
In reappointing Tim Grgurich, Pitt
will make no enemies. In turning its

back on him, it’ll lose too many
valuable friends. Can we afford to
risk that possibility?

So‘, is there really any big decision
to make? Then, why not get about
the business of re-establishing a
program which is just a “commit-
ment” away from total success?
Recruiting just can’t afford the lux-
ury of delay. Would you agree?’

-The Pitt soccer team continues

when the team traveled to nearby
Slippery Rock for a quandrangular
mini-tournament. -The Panthers

I tied Behrend College 1-1, and Slip-

pery Rock 4-4, while defeating the
Slippery Rock freshmen by a

. decisive 5-1 score.

_ The Panthers were on the short
end of the stick from the very begin-
ning of the day but came out look-
ing impressive in their play. Coach
Leo Bemis had chosen number two
goalie Mark Robertson to make the
trip, in order to gain some valuable
indoor experience. When Robert-
son failed to arrive at Slippery
Rock, forwards Jerry Buirge and
Barry Stein, who have no goal-

‘keeping experience, took over in
front of the nets. The two alter-
,«nated responsibilities throughout
the three games. I
In the first contest of the day
against Behrend, Buirge came from
his position at goal to‘ move into
one of the wing spots. Shortly after
the move, he blasted a powerful ball
past the ‘outstretched arms of the

game until the last‘ minute, when
Tony Orlando of Behrend tied it up
at one goal apiece.
In Pitt’s 5-1 win over the Slippery
Rock freshmen, Stein recorded the
first goal, and was followed by
freshman John Hagenbuch, Buirge,
and then John Pizzella adding two
more.
Pitt tried to aveng a disheartening
loss to the Slippery Rock varsity

from last‘ week's tournament in
Grove City, which placed them in

fourth behind the Rock. The game

ended up in a 4-4 draw as Jim

  Instant Replay

   

By SAMUEL SCILJLLO 7

As had been predicted last week, Villanova basketball coach Rollie
Massimino said ‘thanks’ but ‘no thanks’ to Pitt officials who were
trying to lure him into the position of Pitt basketball coach.

Apparently, the six-man committee, which has been screening ap-
plicants, wanted Massimino so badly they could taste it. But they
didn’t get him, so where does that leave Pitt, 12 days after the

In a major development yesterday, Grgurich submitted his ap-
plication for the job. Insiders report that Grgurich is now anxious to
take over the program, under his conditions, which he put so many

Why are there so few candidates for the job? Is it that Pitt’s pro- I
gram with the conditions Grgurich was forced to work under, is that

Yes, precisely’. For example, if football coach Jackie Sherrill were
to resign tomorrow, it’s doubtful th'at a committee would need to be
‘formed to seek a replacement. Candidates would be lining up at the
door for the job, one of the best football positions in college football

today. So why is the present committee starting ‘L6 feel the heat?

They’re beginning to sweat, because deep in their hearts, they feel

they weren’t able to get the man they wanted most for the job. Rollie
Massimino is still at Villanova, and he was able to manipulate the
Pitt negotiators for his own benefits at Villanova, where he just
receiveda new contract. -

It’s truly astonishing that Pitt would make such an attractive offer
to Massimino, over Grgurich. Massimino is not that much better (if

' at all) a coach than Grgurich. He's had more experience, and better
material than Grgurich had, but still only managed to split six games

‘ against Pitt the last three seasons. (Pitt and Grgurich almost didthe
"impossible in 1979 when they lost by only two points at the Villanova
Field House. The Panthers led by 10 points with 2:18 remaining but
a series of turnovers and missed foul shots added up to a numbin
loss.) ' -

But let’s not say either one is a better coach. Call it a draw, or give

aslight nod to either one. That being the case, it is a terrible insult to '
Grgurich'(who never received the respect he deserved from many _

people at Pitt) to see Massimino, or any other applicant, be given a
program of a much higher quality. I

Perhaps the people who count the most, the Pitt players, should be
given a voice. They have all spoken up in favor of the return of

" ‘ Grgurich. Last week, at a meeting with Chancellor Wesley Posvar,

they were forced to sit through a frustrating session of pat answers to
all their questions and complaints.
Now is the time for the committee members to hop off their high
» horses, realize that their egos will survive, and rectify the errors made
by the administration. I _ ‘
Pitt cannot afford to take a gamble and give the job to a coach
who isn’t that much better than Grgurich. It’s time to rehire Tim
Grgurich so that he and his-staff can go about the most important
‘business at this time of year—recruiting.

   The Rehiring of Grgurich May Be

A new head basketball coach is need soon and Tim Grgurich‘1'-s the best man’

Rick Carter Svvims Through Season Toward Notionals

\ By MIKE DICHIARA
Pitt News Ass’! Sports Editor
As the men swimmers prepare for

- Nationals, to be held at Harvard,

Rick Carter will be seeded very high
in his two strongest events, the

V 50-and 1_00-meter freestyle,

This’ year has marked a tremen-
dous improvement for the

' sophomore form Shaler, Pa.

“I’ve shattered a lot of goals that
I set for myself, even more than I
expected,” said Carter. “A big
thing would to be all-America.”

However, the goals for this
season" are not quite finished yet.

One thrill for Carter was making

the Olympic trials;

 

“I had a lot of plans about train-

" ing for the Olympics I’m naturally

disappointed about the cir-
cumstances,” he said. “But
whatever the decision, I have to go
along with it.” ‘~. I

Training can be very grueling.
There is an average of nine practices

per week, including morning ses- -

sionslasting about one and a half
hours and evening sessions lasting
about two and a half hours. Carter
will usually cover seven to eight

- thousand yards during any one ses-

S1011.

“It’s really tough but anything
worth going after will be hard. -You

just have to keep on going,” said
Carter. ‘ ‘

»When Rick began swimming in
eighth grade, one may have thought
it wiser for him to take his 6-foot-8;
200 pound frame and play basket-
ball. . But he decided to leave his
mark in the water.

“I just seemed to have a natural
ability for swimming,” he said,
“and coaches and I just.worked to
improve on it.” ‘

During Carter’s junior and senior
years at Shaler High School, the
swimming team won two state titles

. behind Carter. As a senior, he won
_ an individual title in the 50-meter

freestyle as well as all-America I
status. . ~

Last season as a freshman, there
was a lot of pressure on Carter.

“At the North Carolina meet, ‘I
was anchoring two relays as well as
the 50-/free. We did well and I won
the individual,” he said. I

Last season ended well for him as
he took the 50-free in Easterns. This

season, the North Carolina meet ‘
' also sticks out in his mind because

that’s where he qualified for‘ Na-
tionals.

“Qualifying for Nationals was
big but this year’s Easterns were a
big thrill becai" " was a grudge

match. against .v....st_.Virginia,.l and.‘ , ,Ame_ric,a,hono1;s_. , , ,

we ended up beating them. They
deserved to lose,” Carter said.
If current circumstances surrond-

ing the Olympics continue, there
may be a National meet at the end

of the summer that will place swim-
mer in international competition"
against other nations who par-

ticipate in the boycott.

“I’ll train very hard all summer
and try for that competition but
basically just try to keep improving
as much as I can,” said Carter.

For Rick Carter being seeded at
Nationals as a sophomore is a very
good improvement and he is now
hoping to earn well. deserved all-

running on the board track.
“NCAA meet or not, I was ex-
tremely happy with our indoor

"season. We were invited to every
_ major indoor meet and we'll all be

back next season.”
Outdoor season is a time for

‘ -— _more individual races, as the two-

mile relay is not a regularly schedul-
ed NCAA event. The NCAA gears

ll‘ its schedule toward Olympic events, .

so Conover will mostly run the open
880. His best time in the event was
a" l:52.8, run indoors this year. Pitt
will still have the relay team entered
in several prestigious meets,
however, such as the Penn Relays
and Florida Relays.

‘Conover, an economics major,
said he uses running as more than
just practice for meets.

“I like to run when I have a lot
on my mind.”
\

He seems quite content with his
position on the Pitt team and said

the most attractive part of his col- ‘

legiate running career is “being able
to make friends all over the coun-
try, and being more than just a stu-
dent.”

The Pittsburgh native is not so
content with all aspects of Pitt
athletics, and said, “I think it’s fun-
ny,that a major university with a

’ major football program cannot
support its other programs the way

other schools seem to. If the entire
athletic program benefits from
football, and the football team
played a major bowl and was on na-
tional television, why are there
budget cutsall over?”

His complaint is one commonly
voiced by athletes on Pitt’s
“minor” sports teams, who work
hard but still get less from the
athletic budget. For Conover, hard
work has not been an experience
limited to the tracks and roads of

Pittsburgh. This past summer, his
day went something like this: Get
up at six, arrive. at" the city’s Strip
District by 7:30, work all day
unloading trucks until late, be back
at home by 11:30 at night. -

Such manual labor gave him a

  Vance Law is a Famous Name in Pirate Camp  “ .

By The Associated Press

BRADENTON, Fla.—-There is a
famous baseball name in the Pitts-
burgh Pirates’ spring training camp
and it isn't Willie Stargell, Dave
Parker, John Candelaria or any of
the stars who won the World Series
last fall. . "

In fact, the young man bearing

_ this name won’t make the Pitts-

burgh major league roster. He’s

destined for a triple A club in th

Pirates’s system. -
No, it’s not Dale Berra, son of

I"? Yogi, or Pat Skinner, son of

Pirates’ batting coach Bob Skinner.

The name also brings back some
of ‘ the happier, later some of the

saddest days in Pittsburgh baseball
history. This youngster’s dad was
one of the Pirates’s all-time pit-
ching greats. The father is‘ fourth
among pitchers in strikeouts and in
innings pitched, sixth in winning
games, and third in games pitched.

If you haven’t guessed by now,
we’re referring to the son.of .one-
time major league pitching great
Vernon Law. He’s Vance Law, a
shortstop the Pirates drafted on a
whim in the 39th round of the June
1978 free agent draft.

One of the Pittsburgh scouts sug-
gested, “let’s take Vern’s kid.” At
that point most teams either have

quit selecting or the few left are
picking soccer players and Russian
women ice skaters.

Many baseball fans will recall the ‘

end of Vance’s father’s big league
career. Vernon Law somehow lost
his control. Maybe it was
psychological but the fine right-
hander eouldn’t ﬁnd the plate with
a radar instrument. He finally just
faded away. ~

The son is as surprised to be with
the Pirates as the club is to have him
in the system.

“I didn’t.expect a shot with the
Pirates,” said 23-year-old Vance,
who attended Brigham Young

University. “They hadn’t talked to
me my entire college career.”

Actually, the Pirates’ move was_

dictated more by sentimentality
than baseball acumen. There still
was a fondness for the name,
“Law,” in the organization. They
didn’t believe the young man could
make it. . ‘

But in two full minor league

seasons,» Law, a .6-foot, 2-inch,-

185-pounder, was hit for averages
of .319 in class A, and last season,
.310 in Triple A at, Portland in the
Pacific Coast League. I

Is Vance surprised at how well
he’s done?

“I’m not surprised because I’ve .. 7

always been confident that I could

hit the ball,”. said the I friendly  L
_young man. “I think a lotof credit '-* 
goes to my father for throwing me » fy
hours and hours of batting practice. ; A 
He knows a lot about hitting even 3

though he was a pitcher.......He’s
taught me/an awful lot.”

, Law says the surprise is on the_ ‘ it

part of the Pittsburgh organization.
“I don’t think they expected me

to progress as rapidly as I have,”_‘ 

Law said.

Vance made it clear that while he ' V

was encouraged by his father, he

was never forced to play baseball.“ I Ii’ .
