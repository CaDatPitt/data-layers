A day in the life ofa Pitt alum

In 140 seconds, ﬁlmmaker JohnpHill recounts his meeting with a stranger in nationalftlm contest

Erin Block
Staﬂ’ Writer

Tell me about your day in 140 sec-
onds. Go.

Pitt alumnusjon Hill recounted
the day he met a stranger, Dana
Buning. ’

It was Nov. 30. Hill was dumped

the night before and unemployed,
he said. He went to a café to. draw
a picture _for a friend who was on
her way to visit her mother who
had cancer.

He asked a complete stranger
if she liked the drawing. Her name
was Dana Buning.

“We ended up spending seven
hours together. We started talking

about life and how she was having
a bad day, too,” Hill said. “[Dana]
was just getting over cancer and
her cat died.” , g V

Hill, a 26-year-old freelance
ﬁlmmaker living in Los Angeles,
used this day as the inspiration for
his short ﬁlm “I Meta Girl” — but
he had to keep it at 140 seconds.

Hill submitted the video to a na-_ if

tional ﬁlm competition sponsored
by the Nikon camera company.
Competitors must‘ ﬁlm a day in
their lives in 140 seconds or less.

As of last night, the ﬁlm ranked
ﬁfth in the competition.

“I read about it on Twitter  You
can be funny. It’s whatever you do
or don’t do in a day,” Hill said.

11‘ new members of Stu-
dent Government Board
4 said they were “excited”
to start working after a group
retreat during which the Board

' collectively agreed on initiatives

for the new year.

_ Initiatives such as “Behind
the Glass Door” represent the
semester’s new direction and
focus of the Board, which met
publicly for the ﬁrst time at last
night’s meeting. '

Board President Charlieshull
explained the initiative.

The Board hopes to “hold
openphouses for students to come
in the office and see what work

i we speciﬁcally do. This is toward

the overall goal of more trans-
parency for the Student Govern-
ment Board,” Shull said.

Details of nonproﬁt deals  
remain mystery to many

Officials decline to give details on amounts of pledged donations

Michael Macagnone
Senior Staf Writer

The end of the tuition tax sig-
naled the beginning of closed-door
negotiations about which govern-
ment and university ofﬁcials will
divulge few details.

Mayor Luke Ravenstahl an-
nounced four days before Christmas
that he would drop his proposal to
tax 1 percent of tuition because Pitt,
Carnegie Mellon andnonproﬁt in-
surance company Highmark agreed
to increase their donations to the

city.

Representatives from those ‘

groups and from city government
offices initially declined to say how
much their donations would in-
crease, saying they were still work-
ing out the speciﬁcs of the deal.

Almost three weeks later, they’re
remaining mum, revealing neither
how much the groups will donate
norwhy only two of the city’s 10 col-
leges and art institutes will increase
their donations.

Representatives from Raven-
stahl’s office didn’t respond to ﬁve
calls for comment and two e—mails
sent during the past week, and rep-
resentatives from Highmark did not
return calls either.

Officials from Pitt and_CMU of-
fered a few insights into the deal,
butboth Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele
and CMU spokesman Ken Walters
declined to say how much their in-
stitutions will donate.

Fedele referenced an initiative
called the Pittsburgh Public Service

&.1&.¢

Fund, which operated from 2005
through 2007_. As part of the fund,
more than 100 nonproﬁts gave the
city a combined $14 million in dona-
tions in lieu of paying taxes during
that period.

“We are not disclosing the spe-
ciﬁc amount, however, we do an-

conference.

ticipate contributing more than we
contributed to the public service
fund in 2005, 2006 and 2007,” Fe-
dele said in an e-mail.

Pitt has not disclosed how much
it donated to the ﬁrst Public Service
Fund, only saying that itwas “a large
contributor” in a statement Chan-
cellor Mark Nordenberg made this
past November.

Walters attempted to explain the
schools’ conﬁdentiality, saying, “It’s
like [it was] under the Public Service
Fund. They kept the numbers rela-
tively conﬁdential.”

He also said he expects the city
to approach other universities as
well, and Fedele said he expects that
“the other universities, as well as
other nonproﬁts, will provide dona-
tions to the city.”

-s . ..-- -,...........--..

Of Pitt, CMU and Highmark,
Walters said, “It’s a non-proﬁt co-
alition that we’re sort of spearhead-
mg.”. ' T

Fedele said that the total contri-
butions from Pitt, CMU andVHigh-
mark would likely be less than the
$15 million needed to cover a hole in
the city’s budget. City officials pre-

_ dicted that Ravenstahl’s Fair Share

Tax, which many students and
university officials opposed, would
have brought in $16 million.

City Councilman Bill Peduto,
who heads City Council’s Committee
on Finance and Law, said neither he

nor other Council members know of "

a binding agreement between Pitt,
CMU, Highmark and the city. All
they know, he said, is that the uni-

' versities are “willing to have discus-

sions” about increased donations
to the city.

Peduto said he was concerned
that the groups haven’t reached a
solid decision yet. _ _

“You can’t balance abudget on a
press conference,” he said.

The deal followed almost two
months of heated discussion, pro-
tests and packed Council meetings.
Ravenstahl introduced the tax as ‘a
‘‘last resort” after his re—election
in November, saying he would con-
sider dropping the tax if someone
could ﬁnd an alternative that would
cover the $15 million hole in the
budget. ‘ .

The Pittsburgh Council on High-
er Education, a group represent-
ing 10 local schools, including Pitt,
threatened to take the city to court
if it passed the Fair Share Tax.

in full because “The event did not
coincide with the mission state-
ment of Hillel,” Board member
David Gau said.

Hillel’s mission statement, ac-
cording to its website, is, “Our mis-
sion is to enrich the lives ofjewish
students so that they may enrich
the Jewish people and the world.”

The “Dating-Violence Aware-

ness Program” planned to bring _

a speaker from Florida to campus
for four days in February.

Five students from Hillel would
accompany the speaker and engage
in role playing different dating situ-
ations. V S

Josh Glass, Hillel’s business
. manager, was frustrated with the
verdict.

“This was a really wideiranging
event -— very different organiza-
tions,” Glass said. “To hear that
it doesn’t coincide with our state-

” door’ transparency idea

ﬁrst knowing the reasons.

“We don’t hear what the rea-
sons are behind their decisions
until we’re at the Board meeting,
and once we’re here, since‘ we don’t
have time to prepare ourselves, we
can’t defend the decisions,” Weaver

‘ said.

Weaver said he thinks the dis-
cussion should be-held at Board

meetings so people are aware of '

the Board’s thought process.

Previousboards didn’t require
the allocations committee to give
groups all information about al-
locations.

Shull said he thinks he has some A

ideas for addressing Rainbow Alli-
ance’s concerns, but he didn’t want
to promise anything without dis-
cussing his ideas with the alloca-
tions chair ﬁrst. V
Shull said he thought about ask-
ing the allocations chair to instruct

ment, I really don’t think that that’s
fair.” ‘

Glass said that if SGB is ac-
knowledging the event could be
a productive social action project,
he didn’t think it mattered who
‘ran it.

' James Weaver, president of
Rainbow Alliance, said it was hard
to protest the decisions without

each group’s liason on the commit-
tee to inform groups of the com-
mittee’s recommendations before
the Board votes on them.-

The Board also announced two
ofﬁcer positions yesterday.

Gau will serve as the Board’s
president pro-tempore, and Ali
Noorbaksh will serve as business
manager. _

city Council to post
meetings on website

Initiative meant to increase transparency, ease of access p

Liz Navratil
News Editor

City Council began streaming its
meetings online yesterday as part
of an initiative meant to increase
the Council’s transparency.

The Council plans to broadcast
all of its Tuesday meetings online
live. The video footage is available
under the Legislativeilnformation
Center portion of the Council’s
website, www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/
council.

After the meetings, the Council
will post portions of the meeting
that cover issues of interest, pair-
ing those videos with the relevant
legislative documents.

People who visit the site will be
able to search for City Council vid-
eos online. 7

Councilman Bill Peduto, who
led the initiative _to stream City
Council meetings online, said in a
news release that he is pleased that
“City Council meetings will be more
transparent and the public will have
easier access to information that is

important to their community.” .
, “This is the first signiﬁcant
change since the early 1980s when
meetings were cablecast,” he said.
“Over the past 25 years, times have
changed, and governments must
change too. People must see how
their tax dollars are being spent —
more eyes watching equals better
government.” »
Peduto said he hopes more gov-
ernmental organizations, such as
the Plarming Commission and Zon-
ing Board, will begin posting their
meetings online as well.

Among the judges is‘Rainn Wilson, most
known for his role as Dwight in the NBC com-

video Monday night: “Holey Moley! Another

just hit me that Ihad this magical day with a
complete stranger.” A

Hill said the experience felt therapeu-

tic.

“A complete stranger is like talking to a
psychiatrist because I may never see them
again. I can say anything. With roommates
and friends you have your shields up,” he said.
“You don’t want to say to people how vulner-
able you are. _It’s a weird kind of therapy.”

Hill said that after his dad died, he felt
responsible for the rest of his family.

“You can’t tell them you’re scared,” he
said. » -

Buning had a similar experience. Their
liveslparalleled each other’s that day.

Filming the day was far harder than ex-
periencing it. Hill had less than 40 hours to
shoot, edit and submit his ﬁlm if he wanted
to make the Dec. 15 deadline for the com-
petition. '

“I don’t do dramatic. I do ‘silly comedies,”
Hill said. “I got the chance to work on a dif-
ferent scale. To be able to tell a story in two
minutes is pretty challenging.”

First, he had to ﬁnd his cast. He told Bun-

ing he wouldn’t ﬁlm the project without her.
She hesitated at ﬁrst. She wasn’t a good ac-
tress, she said.

Then there was the awkwardness that
came with ﬁlming the last scene, in which
Buning and Hill kiss.

Hill said‘ he couldn’t ﬁnd an actor who
resembled him, so he decided to perform in
the video himself. He shot the kissing scene
seven times, only to wind up using the ﬁrst
take. ’

“Warren said it’s not about you. I agree with
it. I didn’t create this life, why should I feel

be humbled. Vote or don’t vote for me. I just

members his days at the Creation Station,

. “We used the ﬁrst one because we had no

- idea what was going down,” he said. “People’s

reactions are real the ﬁrst time. [In the take] I

did thislweird wave after I kissed her. I didn’t
know what to do.” ‘

He later decided to edit out the wave.

Hill said the video covered most of the
pair’s day, except for an adventure at an ice
cream parlor.

“A month ago, I went to a Vampire Week-
end concert. I bought like 40 popsicles from
an ice cream man,” he said. “I asked Dana
when the last time she had free ice cream
was. I asked to buy her ice cream.”

Buning, a 32-year-old freelance TV pro-
ducer, said recapping the day she met Hill
was “an amazing experience.”

'“I had a wonderful day withjon. To have
a project that reﬂects that day and our life
experiences is really cool. What better way
to wrap up a year than to celebrate with a
complete stranger?”

If Hill wins, he plans to use the money to

start a new project. He then wants to visit

Hilllsaid Creation Station was based on
the fourth floor of tl1e Cathedral of Learning,
and he and his friends would often sneak in

there after hours to do extra work on their '

projects. -

“We used to sneak out at 3 a.m., crawl
under the gate at the Cathedral or go through
the automatic door that faces Bigelow,” he
said. “We used to be able to pry it open if
you were strong enough. Then, we’d quickly
run to the basement, take the elevator to the
wrong ﬂoor to fool the security guards and
run to the fourth ﬂoor. We did all these crazy
"things and I built from that. Everything we
did was teaching me. Having nothing gives
you the opportunity to be creative.”

Hill said he learned everything he knows

about ﬁlmmaking from his experience at the -

Creation Station.

“This is thetruth,” he said. “When my crew
and I showed up at the café to shoot ‘I Met a

I learned everything from Pitt — editing in

Full-body scans,
it’s flight time

hankfully Umar Farouk I
N Abdulmutallab’s suspected

plan to explode Northwest
Flight 253 was foiled —— but we
must never forget how. It wasn’t
the efforts of airport security in
Amsterdam, but a misﬁring of his
on-person explosives that pre-
vented tragedy. '

In our post-9/11 world, airport
security has grown more strin-
gent. But as shown on that chilling
Christmas day, the skies still aren’t
safe. Let’s make them safer. .

Metal detectors seem an almost
archaic tool now as terrorists adopt
innovative, non-metal explosives
that all too easily slip through se-

curity. The answer‘? Full—cavity .

strip searches? Well, not yet.

However, full-body scan-
ning technology has excited the
Transportation Security Admin-
istration’s interest since the Dec.
25 incident. ‘The TSA hopes to
instate 150 more full-body scan
machines in airports nationwide
this year, with an eventual goal of
300 more machines by 2011, ac-
cording to CNN. Currently, about
40 scanning machines are in use
in 19 airports.

The scanners can supposedly
detect any object masked by cloth-
ing. While foolproof detection can
perhaps never be accomplished,
human error can enter any sce-
nario — these scanners are more
than just expensive new toys for
airport security. They’re the most
reliable, readily available technol-
ogy we have right now.

With such revealing scans, pri-
vacy issues leave some hesitant to
have their more—or-less nude -

albeit in the negative — ﬁgures
searched by airport security.

— TSA demonstrations of the
scanners position the ofﬁcer read-
ing the scan in a separate area from
the passenger being scanned. It’s
also emphasized that passengers’
faces will be blurred out on the
screens and that the scans will sup-
posedly not be saved or stored.

They’re costly enough, but these
machinesare quicker than compul-
sory pat downs — a measure that’s

' even been called perfunctory. Se-

curity technologist Bruce Schneier
told CNN, “Any pat down that you
experience that doesn’t embarrass
you physically is one that’s not very
effective.” _

Critics of the scanning ma-
chines say money should instead
go toward advancing intelligence.
But given the red ﬂags and gaffes -
warning from the suspect’s father
about his extremism, a supposed
spot on a terrorist watch list and
a then-unrevoked visa — when

T the Nigerian suspect boarded the
plane, our conﬁdence in intelli— '

gence alternatives was shaken.

In contrast, the full-body scan-
ners are more concrete terrorism
determent devices. Unless the po-
tential terrorist hides an explosive
substance in an oriﬁce or fold of
skin, the technology appears dis-
tinctly accurate.

For as much physical security
the machines should provide, their
presence would ideally dissuade
potential attacks. Americans don’t
need a false sense of security —— we
need both something that should
make us feel safer and something
that actually does make us safer.

This year’s Student Government
Board is comprised of nine tal-
ented student leaders whose indi-

V vidual initiatives could make this

university a better place.

For instance, Board member
Zack Bombatch wants to see ev-
ery Pitt shuttle stop physically
marked similar to the way that
current Port Authority routes are
marked. Bombatch said that his
role is to talk to the city and the
University and bring them togeth-
er to discuss the proposition.

Another promising initiative is
Phil LaRue’s plan to create an “on-
line sustainability resource” that
tells students when and where to
recycle both on campus and in
student-heavy neighborhoods like
Shadyside and North Oakland.

These are both projects that
have the potential to beneﬁt stu-
dents, and they are complemented

by SGB’s overall goals for the year
that include making Pitt a more
environmentally friendly campus
and increasing student participa-
tion in SGB.

Regrettably, these laudable
broad initiatives were overshad-
owed by the fact that they were
drafted at a two-day SGB retreat
last weekend held at an undis-
closed location and paid for with
funds from the Student Activities
Fee that SGB allocated itself.

Newly inaugurated Board Pres-
ident Charlie Shull ﬁrst discussed
the retreat in comments published
in Thursday’s Pitt News when he
said that the Board would have
speciﬁc plans for the year to share
with students after a weekend re-
treat at an undisclosed location.

Reading about an undisclosed
retreat taken by SGB, I immedi-
ately envisioned SGB members
taking’ a weekend vacation to
Nemacolin Woodlands, relaxing
poolside on the students’ dime.
Worse still, Shull refused to say
where the retreat occurred when I

ﬁrst interviewed him on Monday,
and that the lack of disclosure was
in keeping with SGB tradition.

Moreover, Shull said that the
retreat was paid for with funds
from the Student Activities Fee
and that these funds were allo-

After talking to Shull, the sit-
uation looked worse than I had
imagined: SGB paidfor the retreat
with student funds, SGB allocated
the funds itself in a process with
little outside oversight, and it
looked as if SGB had something
to hide.

Shull outlined some auspicious
plans for the next year including
greater student interaction with
City Council and the inclusion of
ethics guidelines in SGB’s bylaws,
but none of his ideas mattered if
he started his term by spending
student money without telling
students what was done with it.

But hours after I interviewed
him, Shull surprised me. He called
me back and said that, after re-
ﬂecting on the issue, he recog-

nized that students did have a

was being spent.

Shull said that the location
of the retreat was a three-room
cabin at Hidden Valley —— a mid-

level ski resort about an hour east V

of Pittsburgh. The board members
spent the retreat working on the
year’s agenda and getting to know
each other better, Shull said.
Shull said that the cabin cost

about $800 a night and expenses

Of course, greater transpar-

beneﬁts the SGB members whose H

Afterjgiving me the details I

on the retreat, Shull said, “It’s

more. Indeed, although it’s pos-
sible to disagree with the retreat
or with spending student money
on it, it’s important to recognize
that Shull set a new tone for this
year when he chose to disclose the
location and cost of the retreat.
It was a recognition that stu-
dents deserve to know where their

ly, it foreshadows further steps to
increase SGB’s transparency. After

I’m notgiving Shull or SGB a

important to give them credit for
correcting a mistake and making
one element of SGB more trans-
parent rather than less. I look for-
ward to writing more about how

progress and less about scandals

End poverty with Canada

Force behind Harlem Children’s Zone, Geoffrey Canada, deserves propsr I

 
  
 

Mason Herron
Columnist

Geoffrey Canada is an unlikely hero
from an unexpected place. Canada,
58, grew up in the South Bronx. His
parents divorced when he was just
4 years old. Canada graduated from
Bowdoin College and received his
master’s degree in education from
Harvard University. A _ »
Canada is now CEO of the Ne
York—based nonproﬁt, Harlem Chil-
dren’s Zone, which seeks to end the

‘ cycle of poverty that has deﬁned the

Harlem neighborhood for genera-
tions. ‘

The Children’s Zone includes
parenting workshops such as “Baby
College,” a nine-week term of parent-
ing classes that focuseson discipline
and child development. According
to the Zone, “Among other lessons,
the workshops promote reading to
children and verbal discipline over
corporal punishment.” Pre—kinder—
garten classes come next, followed
by an intensive K-12 charter. school
with extended hours. - , -3.’

Canada’s ambition is staggering. '

In the early ’90s, Canadatook overa
modest nonproﬁt dedicated to help-
ing poor Harlem teens. However,
Canada “could see only the kids he
wasn’t helping,” said Paul Tough, a
journalist who has spent consider-
able time documenting Canada’s
mission.

“We’re not interested in saving
100 kids,” Canada said to Tough.
“Even 300 kids, even 1,000 kids to
me is not going to do it. We want to
be able to talk about how you save
kids by the tens of thousands be-
cause that.’s how we’re losing them.
We’re losing kids by the tens of thou-
sands.”

Over the past few years, research
conducted by economists, social sci-
entists and others has concluded that
the difference between the success
of a child —' say, extending from
from middle-class to lower-class
backgrounds — was found in early

childhood development. The solu- ‘

tion, at least from Canada’s perspec-
tive, was to target children early and
follow them throughout the rest of

their formative years. Ideally, by the I

time they’re 18, they’re applyingfor
college rather than probation.
Canada’s ambition is outmatched
only by his success. According to
the Zone’s website, 100 percent of
third—graders at two of the Zone’s
“Promise Academies” the name for
the extended—hour charter schools
— “tested at or above grade level on
the math exam, outperforming their
peers in New York State, New York
City, District 5, and black and white
students throughout the state.” Last
year, “93 percent of Promise Acad-

emy High School ninth-graders V

passed the statewide Algebra Re-
gents exams.” Nearly every point of
data suggests positive results created
by the Harlem Children’s Zone,
While still a presidential nomi-

nee, Barack Obama made a promise
to establish 20 new promise neigh-
borhoods across the country to “be
modeled after the Harlem Children’s
Zone.” Replication, however, does
not mean merely dropping the Har-
lem Children Zone’s model on, say,
Detroit or South Central Los Angeles.
Activists and volunteers in cities will
be encouraged to develop their own
programs that work for those com-
munities. The federal government
will disperse grants only to those
programs that show the most prom-
ise. Cities will be_ competing against
one another to create the best pov-

erty—ﬁghting programs possible.
Competition ‘— the driving force of
our economy — will be a welcome

"addition in the war on poverty.

In the past, programs meant to
combat poverty were widespread
and generalized. The programs and
assistance in one community were
similar to’ every other community
or city. For the Harlem Children’s
Zone, the task is local. There is no
bureaucracy to deal with, and the
program operates within the context

' of the neighborhood’s speciﬁc issues

and circumstances.

Obama’s policy isn’t just liberal or S

conservative — it’s both, but it’s also
above politics. It might be a govern-
ment—funded program, but it is no
entitlement. The Harlem Children’s
Zone provides parents with the same
tools that middle-class parents have,
but it still demands that they ﬁilﬁll
their obligations. The Zone attacks
a culture ofbroken homes and nega-
tive inﬂuences while also providing
communities with educational and

\ social opportunities. -
America has a history of strug-

gle when it comes to poverty. For-
tunately, we are learningfrom our
mistakes. Reformers are ‘learning
that the earlier in a'child’s life that
you begin to ﬁght the inﬂuences of
poverty, the greater the chances of
success.

In 19 64, President Lyndon]ohn—
son told Congress, “For the ﬁrst time
in our history it is possible to con-
quer poverty.” At that moment in
time, we had the will, but we did not
have the right weapons. If people
such as Geoffrey Canada continue
to innovate, we might ﬁnally route
the menace that is poverty.

“The Book of Beer Pong”

By Ben Applebaum and Dan Dis-
orbo '

Chronicle Books

Let’s pretend you’re at a party.
You’re 21, obviously. You have a
pretty decent buzz going, and you
suddenly feel conﬁdent enough
to grab some innocent-looking

guy stationed in the corner of the .

basement and drag him to the beer
pong sign-up sheet.
You wait a little bit before your

turn arrives. You head over to the 1

table. You can already smell vic-
tory in the air. You’re ready. You’re
pumped — until the realization
sets in that, in your 21 years on
Earth, you’ve never actually‘ played
beer pong.

Your palms start to get clammy,
and you glance at your partner
with a look of trepidation. You
realize that the smell of victory,
which has a strange resemblance
to Axe body spray, is actually just
wafting over from the other side
of the table where your opponents

I

are showing off their ability to

juggle pingpong balls with their .

eyes closed.
Panic. What do you do?
“Aim at a speciﬁc cup,” Dan DiS—

orbo said. “A lot of people just go .
4 and toss it, but it’s really important

' to aim at one cup and have a lot of
_ lob in your shot.”

DiSorbo, along with Ben Ap-
plebaum, penned and published
the veritable beer pong bible last
year, “The Book of Beer Pong.”
The duo became acquainted while
swapping advice for the websites
they cofounded —— DiSorbo started
GetBombed.com and Applebaum
created CollegeStories.(;om. They
felt that there should be a_ compen-
dium of beer pong facts and tips,
and so “The Book of Beer Pong”
was born. . .

So how exactly does one set out
to write a nearly 200-page book
about something often shrugged
off as a party game?

“When we started doing the ini-
tial outlines it was surprising how
much information we collected in
a short amount of time,” DiSorbo
said. “It took a full year. We wanted
to make sure we got information

8:30 a.m. — Third alarm goes
off. If it’s a bad day, ,I’ll turn it off,

til 10 a.m. If it’s a good day, this is
the point at which I angrily make
my way upstairs to make breakfast
and get ready.

8:35 to 8:50 a.m. —— Curl lashes,
apply eye shadow, eyeliner, other
eye shadow, mascara, primer,

pale.

9 a.m. —— Stare blankly into
closet and reaffirm my suspicion

that I have absolutely nothing to‘,

wear. . .
9:15 a.m. —- Still staring blank-
ly. Check weather on two differ-
ent websites. Believe the one that
is most detrimental to my hair
and footwear. This often leads to
walking around in rain boots and
carrying an oversized umbrella on
perfectly sunny days.

9:30 a.m..—. Now in a rush, I
throw on some variation of what
I wore the day before: tunic, leg-
gings, cardigan, belt, boots, scarf,

coat, bangles. Done.
9:45 a.m. — Make my way out
the door. Fumble with lock.
=10 a.m. —— If it’s Monday or
Tuesday, I roll into Caribou, get a
small coffee with room for cream
and ﬁnd a table near an outlet.
10:05 a.m. — I work on this
very column or whatever other
writing assignment needs ﬁn-

ishing. My writer’s mind expires

around noon —— by then it’s too
busy thinking about other things,
like my next source of caffeine and
whether I’ll— have time to ﬁnish
reading that book for Lit.

10:30 a.m. — Distracted by '

Facebook, Twitter, Gchat and hi-

lariously titled New York Magazine
articles.

10:50 a.m. — Resume writ-
ing. —

Noon — Finish assignments,
pack up and head out for the rest
of my day.

On the surface, this is all ﬁne
and good. I live a happy life with a

minimal amount of ‘struggle. But,

as I’ve said before, I grow bored
very easily. _

Sure, now that it’s the begin-
ning of a fresh semester, this little
routine seems great. Getting up at
8 a.m.? Charming! The lackadai-
sical luxury of winter break was
getting to me anyway. Sleeping ’til

noon? What a waste!
After just afew weeks or months
of monotony, however, I’ll hita

~ brick wall and approach my day-

to-day routine with the same level
of irritability as an overextended

* toddler in need of a juice box and a

nap. By the time I get used to writ-
ing “2010” at the top of my papers
rather than “2009,” I’ll be ready to
make some changes.

It’s at times like these — the life
and wardrobe ruts — that I need

' to focus on the ﬁner things, like

friends and running and changing
the background on my computer
screen. And shopping.

Every season I make a long list

Rob Marshall’s latest musical is far from Osca,r—wo1'thy

Kieran Layton

“Nine” ,  . .
Starring: Daniel Day—Lewis, Penelope Cruz, Ni-

Director: Rob Marshall
The Weinstein Company
Grade: C+

It turns out that moving from “Chicago” to
Italy might not have been Rob Marshall’s best
move. ‘

The director, knownfor his 2002 Oscar—win-
ning adaptation of the Kander and Ebb ‘classic
“Chicago,” decided to take a much more obscure
musical and applyhis keen eye for songand dance
to the story of afarned Italianﬁlmdirector strug-
gling to come up with his next masterpiece.

The result is “Nine,” and unfortunately, the
ﬁlm isn’t as good as what Marshall has already
proved he is capable of-creating. .

Those who have seen the trailers for the ﬁlm
know that the plot surrounds not only director
Guido Cantini (Daniel Day—Lewis), but more so
the ravishing women who dominate  life. En-
ter the incredible (and criminally underutilized)
female ensemble. - »

Oscar—winners Marion Cotillard (“La Vie en
Rose”) and Penelope Cruz playthejilted wife and
the smoldering, needy mistress, respectively,
and both share anample amount of screen time.
The rest of the women, however, appear all too

brieﬂy, though each commands her scene and
musical number to provide the ﬁlm’s brilliant
moments. »

‘ Fergie, or Stacy Ferguson, plays a prostitute
from Guido’s childhood, and she belts out the
showstopping song “Be Italian.” Kate Hudson
proves she can actually singwith the ﬁlm’s other
standout song, “Cinema Italiano,”a_ndJudi Dench

Sophia Loren appears as Guido’s mom, and Nicole
Kidman phones in her performance as Guido’s
actress muse. , ' -.

Those who thought Kidmanwas icyand stiifin
“The Golden Compass” cancheck out her perfor-
mance here and get back to me — it’s abysmal.

If it sounds_like this review is skirting away
from divulging the plot of the ﬁlm, it’s because
there really isn’t any plot to divulge. This is one
of the ﬁlm’s major weaknesses —— simply. little
actually happens. The end result is just a series
of bland, non—musical scenes interspersed with

each actress’s one number (Coﬁllard gets two, but .

they are the two worst songs in the ﬁlm).

Day-Lewis, though adequate in the leading
role, doesn’t reallybringanythingto the tablethat
any other similarly unkempt and rough—around—
the-edges actor could.

The art direction and cinematography are
admirable, but they losetheir effectwhen paired
with such a middling ﬁlm.

Though it had Oscar buzz going into the sea—

— it’s this year’s “Phantom of the Opera.”

“We actually talked to a V professor at
Dartmouth who also attended Dartmouth

According to the book, beer pong origi-
nated at Dartmouth in the 1950s. Young lads
would blow off steam by playing pingpong,
but to amp things up they would place paper

would sound like the authors were taking
themselves too seriously, but they manage
to ﬁnd a balance by approaching the topic
‘with a sense of humor.

the book is packaged that way. But at the

wanted to have a mock-serious undertone,”

The book includes how—to guides for ﬁx-
ing dented pong balls, being a beer pong
photojournalist and successfully distract-
ing your opponent. There are 16 illustrat-
ed techniques including one titled “The
Cirque,” a motion that dauntingly involves
one player balancing on one hand on the
other player’s head.

Along with the main chapters, the book
is chock—a-block full with entertaining side-
bars containing trivia (for example: “The
original Ping—Pong ball was a rounded
Champagne cork. Keep that in mind next
time you are out of balls.”) and tips that you
never thought you needed to know. DiSorbo
said their ideas “came from sitting around

brainstormingvand thinking about the nu-

ances of beer pong.”

They outlined the eight archetypal play-
ers, including DiSorbo’s own pet peeve, The
Rule Nazi, deﬁned as the player who “takes
the game way too seriously. And that’s com-
ing from the people who wrote a book on it.
Sure, this type helps maintain the legitimacy
of the sport. But playing him is not going
to be fun.”

One of the book’s major arguments is
that beer pong is, indeed, a sport. They sum
up their rationale in a 100—word essay and
provide these ﬁve additional reasons for

why it’s the best sport: “’Roids don’t improve
game play; Alcohol testing not required;
Supports America’s plastic cup industry;
No salaries mean no salary caps; The word
‘beer’ is in the name.”

So go forth, young students‘ (who are of
age, of course) and embrace the so—called
sport of beer pong. And remember —— Aim
at a cup.

— too long a list — of everything I want to
buy. I’ll only buy things that are on the list
(no need to waste money on items I’m not
dying for) and shop around until I determine
W, the cheapest place I can get it.

This year some of the things on my list
include: a denim shirt, vintage slips, thigh-

new grey jeans and a tie-dye scarf. I pick up"

one of the items whenever I need to spruce
up my wardrobe.

We all have our routines that make us
feel comfortable. We go to the same places,
talk to the same people and wear the same

things. But at what point does a routine g

become a rut? I suppose it’s when those
aforementioned habits lose their novelty
and fail to bring us the same pleasure they
did originally.

Currently I’m trying to pull myself out
of my morbidly black monotonic tenden-
cies. I used to think my head-to—toe black

ensembles made me look like a chic New
Yorker, but now I’m thinking they just make
me look lazy. I’ve also recently phased vests
out of my wardrobe. I used to wear them
at least once a week, but now they don’t
seem to add as much to my outﬁts as they
once did. _

But here’s the thing — routines are addic-
tive. They’re hard to break. Twenty dollars
says if you spot me on campus today, I’ll be
wearing all black and a vest.

tween a baritone and a tenor by ear, their voices
are hardly distinguishable. The one thing that
is noticeable is the lack of original music. For a
group that satisﬁes such a unique market in the
music business, it is shocking that Il Divo does
not experiment freely and put more of itselfinto
its work.

Still, the music ofIl Divo is so enchanting that
one doesn’t needtohearthe applause of araucous
Spanish crowd to feel transported to an equally
romantic state of mind.

Chelsea Cole is certainly no stranger
to the record books.

-. At her New Jersey high school,
Rancocas Valley in Mt. Holly, Cole
set both the school record for most
blocked shots in a game.with' 11, and
the state record for mostrebounds in
a game with 29. i I 5 ’ ‘ '

Now as a junior forward with the
Panthers, Cole has made history once
again bybecomingthe ﬁrst Pitt player
to secure 20 or more rebounds in a
single game since 1980.

Cole’s back—to-back 21—rebound
performances against Duquesne and
Marquette marked not only her per-
sonal best efforts, but also those ofthe
entire Big East conference.

However, Cole doesn’t set out to
break records.

“I did not even know about the re-
bounding records and the 1980 his-
torical mar ” Cole said. “The coaches
always stress improvement, so if I get
20 rebounds, the next step is to go out
and get 30.”

It is this humility and tenacity that
allow Cole to excel on the court. She
is currently ﬁrst in the Big East, and

seventh in the nation, averaging 11.5 v

rebounds a game.

As a freshman and sophomore,
Cole learned about work ethic and
opportunity from other Panther star
players, laying the foundationfor her
own success.

“During my freshman year, I

‘ deﬁnitely looked up to Xenia Stewart

and her commitment to the team,”

A Cole said. “She came in every day

with intensity and a willingness to
iimp,rj_ove.” I
In fact, Cole’s best personal memo-

‘ ryfromhertimewiththeteamcomes

from her freshman season, when she
made herﬁrst start againstseton Hall
and scored 17 points.

“I remember Mercedes [Walker]
was injured, and I did not know I was
getting the start until right before the
game,” Cole said. “I was nervous, but
I knew it was an opportunity to make
my mark and come out of Mercedes’
shadow.”

Cole might have emerged from
under Walker’s wing, but Cole’s style
of play is still unique.

While Walker and Cole are both
6-foot-3, Walkerwas able to rely on her
ability to take up lateral space under
the basket. Cole, however, looks to her
quickness to dominate in the paint.

“Because of mybuild, I realize that
I can’t go through people,” Cole said.
“I have to get around them or go over
them.”

Cole noted the summer condition-
ing and strength-training programs
allowed her to develop her physical
ability so during the season practice
canbe dedicatedtoworking on game
situations.

AnotherqualityofCole’sthatmakes

. her indispensable as a forward is her

versatility. Prior to a game against Ap-
palachian State, coach Agnus Berenato
decided to move Cole from the four
spot to the ﬁve spot, a position which
requires speed and agility.

“I thought Appalachian State was
a little quicker than us, so I made the
switch with Chelsea,” Berenato said.
“Chelsea can contain like a guard.”

In fact, Cole thrives off of the en-
ergy that comes with utilizing her
quickness. . ‘

“Forme, whenidive for loose balls
and really make hustle plays through-

. out the game, that is when I knowI am

playing my best,” Cole said.

Rebounding can sometimes fall
under the radar, as the ﬂashy scor-
ers seem to take priority But for Cole,
being able to focus on her rebound-
ing efforts has been quite enjoyable,
especially since she trusts the talent
surrounding her on the court. .

“In high school, Ifelt thatl needed
tobe themainrebounder and the main
scorer for the team, but nowl can get
backto my specialty,” Cole said. “I have

The most indelible memory of last
year’s Pitt basketball team came
when DeJuan Blair ﬂipped the Hus-
kies’=Hasheem Thabeet over his
shoulder as the Panthers knocked

off then—No. 1 Connecticut 76-68. ‘

Though both players have since
moved on to the pros, Pitt coach
Jamie Dixon knows that the rivalry
won’t be any less intense when No.
16 Pitt travels to Hartford to take on
No. 15 Connecticut tonight.

“Every game [between Con-
necticut and Pitt] comes with a huge

amount of hype,” Dixon said. “You
can’t pick a best game. You can go
‘through every one and point to any
one of them.” '

Pitt guard Brad Wanamaker said
the Huskies will try to bounce back
from last season’s losses against the
Panthers, as Pitt also knocked off
Connecticut once more later in the
season.

“They’re going to try to get after
us because we got them two times
last year,” Wanamaker said. “That’s
what [is] on their mind —— get re-
venge on us.”

Wanamaker and fellow guards
Ashton Gibbs and Jermaine Dixon

with 17.5 points per game.

Jamie Dixon notedJermaine Dix-

recently recovered from a broken
foot, and Pitt is 5-0 with him as a
starter.

“His value is not represented by
the numbers,”Jamie Dixon said. “He
is our toughest guy, and he makes
other guys tougher.” A

According to Dixon, the game
tonight might come down to Pitt’s
ability to stiﬂe Connecticut’s transi-

fense. Pitt senior forward Gilbert
Brown agreed.

“If we can put them in a half?

defense that we bringin every night,
and we’ll be ﬁne,” Brown said.

Taking a look at the upcoming year in sports

_During the next 12 months, sports fans can look forward to more fun from Brett Favre, Gilbert Arenas and plenty more

MCT Campus '

Rasheed Wallace’s waist won’t be bare after, he starts wearing his title belt next season.

Adam Littman
Assistant Sports Editor

The end of each year consistently brings
countless recaps of that year’s most memo-

rable moments. The start of each year, .

however, is less prone’ to offer previews
for the upcoming year.

While fellow columnist Greg Trietley
did a swell job predicting the upcoming
decade in sports, I felt like he skimmed
over 2010 just a bit. Luckily, I had some

‘free time and decided to let The Pitt News’

faithful readers know what, in my expert
opinion, they can expect in sports from
now until December.

For the first time ever, the NFL Pro
Bowl is played the week before the Super
Bowl as opposed to the week after. This
means no players on either Super Bowl-
qualifying team can actually play in the
game. In addition, the Pro Bowl is moved
from its traditional venue in Hawaii to the
same city where the Super Bowl is held.
Because of this, most remaining players
drop outlof the game for various “inju-
ries” leaving just Wes Welker to show up

ready to play.

While the Vikings don’t make the Super
Bowl, Brett Favre still gets to go as The
Who hire him to be their youth consultant,
in charge of helping the famed rockers

appeal to the kids. His advice: Get a pair

of Wrangler jeans and then back out of the
deal and hold out for the Grey Cup halftime
gig instead. The Who don’t listen, instead
opting to appeal to the youth by smashing
their instruments. After doing this, the
NFL immediately offers an apology and
announces Barry Manilow as next year’s
halftime performer, leaving my mom as
one of 12 people in America happy with
the decision. -

ily to me from experience.’-’

For Cole, the realization that she needed to
factor into the rebounding equation came early
in preseason workouts.

Because ofmybuild,Irealizethat
I can’t go through people. I have
to get around them or go over

Chelsea Cole

“Coaches kept emphasizingthatwe neededto
improve our rebounding, andlﬁnally recognized
that they were talking about my department
and that I needed to step up my game in that
area,” Cole said. A

Based on the praise from Berenato, Cole ap-
pears to have done just that. ,

“Chelsea is getting better every game,” Be-
renato said. “She is coming into her own and
becoming an explosive athlete.”

After Cole’s 15—reboundperfonnance against
Valparaiso, Berenato said every game Cole “is
capable of 15 rebounds and more.”

. In four out ofthe nextﬁve games, Cole posted
rebounding numbers of 16, 19 and her two sea-
son—high 21—rebound performances.

Cole can see differences in this year’s team

that have contributed to her success on the
boards. '

The Panthers have developed a team of bal-
anced scorers, multiple players who will take
shots and distribute the ball more evenly than
in the past.

Cole sees this as another chance to impact
her team.

“Nowthat the scoring is more dispersed, we
have more people shooting,” Cole said. “Conse-
quently, there is more need for rebounds and
second opportunities.” A

The identity of the 2009-10 Panthers has
been somewhat of a mystery. Initially, the plan
was to solidify the team as a running team that
attacked the transition game. While that idea
still is a goal, a shift has been made to sharpen
executions a plan which Cole says includes “mak-
ing offense from defense.”

Regardless of which direction the Panthers
choose to follow in their strategy, Cole will un-
doubtedly play a major role as a key rebounder
and defensive force. _

The accolades continue to come to Cole, as
she was recently named to the weekly Big East
Honor Roll, which distinguishes outstanding
players in the conference. Yet, Cole has not lost
sight of her original intent for the season.

“My focus has been to let the game come to
me, and that has helped me with my rebounding
this season,” said Cole.

IfCole builds upon her already-irnpressive
statistics, her name might pnce again ﬁnd its
way into the record books of collegiate women’s
basketball.

‘who missed last season’s showdowns with a
knee injury, has eight games this year with at
least 20 points.

“He just gets guys on their heels,” Dix-
on said. “I think he is the fastest guy we’ve
seen.”

Forward Stanley Robinson and guard
Kemba Walker run the ﬂoor with Dyson. The
sophomore Walker, whose speedjamie Dixon
praised, averages 12.7 points per contest.

The 6-foot-9 Robinson, along with 6-foot-9
Alex Oriakhi and 6-foot-9 Gavin Edwards,

gives Connecticut a size advantage over Pitt. A

Robinson grabs nearly eight rebounds per
game.

.“They have a bunch of big guys,” Brown
said. “We have to be prepared to box out and
hit the boards really hard.”

Connecticut enters tonight coming off a 72-
69 loss to No. /12 Georgetown on Saturday af-
ternoon. Pitt, on the other hand, hasn’t played
since a 74-71 victory over Cincinnatijan. 4.

Brown said the break was welcome.

“If anything, we should be well-rested,”
Brown said. “We went through a tough road
stretch against Syracuse and Cincinnati, so I

-......'........v.........;..

think it was a good thing we had a nine-day
layoff.” - l

_ As withjermaine Dixon, Brown reiterated
that the practice time during the break allowed
him to get back into the swing of things.

“We have a lot to do,” he said after the
Cincinnati victory in which he scored 17
points. “Coach pushes us every day. We don’t
settle.” _ 0

In the four games since Brown returned
from last semester’s academic suspension,
Pitt’s offensive output is up eight points "while
holding opponents to_61 points against.

Thanks to those statistics, Pitt moved up
in both major polls this week. The Panthers
climbed to No. 16 in the AP Top 25 rankings,
and they made their ﬁrst appearance of the
season in the coaches’ poll, checking in at No.
20.

While Connecticut isn’t the highest-ranked
team Pitt has faced this year, Dixon said they
might be the toughest to defend.

“Syracuse, I told them, was the best transi-
tion team we’ll play all year long,” Dixon said.
“Now I voided that statement. After watching
Connecticut, I think they are the best.”
