DAVE HART ,, ’
He Care All H 0 Had for 'I'hroc Y('ar.s-

An Analysis

Who Misplaced Integrity?  

by GEORGE LIES
Associate Editor

It probably pained Athletic Di-
rector Frank Carver to walk into
Dave Hart’s office Monday. And
it probably pained Hart to .ask
Carver what was going to hap-
pen. Because both of them al-
ready knew.

Technically, Hart resigned. He
withdrew, luckily in time, from
an institution that would have
made him anothe_r old man in an
old man’s atmosphere.

HART TOOK with him, if noth-

-ing else, an honest tongue and an

honest heart. And that’s a great
deal more than what he left be-
hind in the laps of Dr. Wesley
Posvar and Mr. Carver.

It is unfortunate indeed that
Hart was the victim of circum-
stance. When he signed to coach
a rag-a-muffin crew, he was giv-
en a four year contract to do a
six year job. His fourth year was
bought-off.

It was bought off by a few rich
alumni, who happen to own a
few corporations downtown. Mr.
Carver received more than one
such letter. it is certain, but one
is known to have carried at least
18 names of interested alumni.

There’s no telling when exact-

ly Hart lost the job.’ The best bet,
although many folks point to the
West Virginia game, is the Air
Force game. Dr. Posvar used to
work there, remember.

DR. POSVAR came to Pitt
about one and one-half years af-
ter Hart. And now, Dr. Posvar is
putting his foot down. But hard.
-At first, and naturally so, Dr. Pos-
var accepted Hart. He didn’t
know anything about him, and so
he sat through two years of losing
‘football. I

Dr. Posvar has been trying to
restructure Pitt, and it’s very hard
to keep one’s mind on academics
when athletics, specifically foot-
ball, color everything black.
Though, he acted in accordance
with Mr. Carver and several
others, Dr. Posvar must certain-
ly catch the brunt of the deci-
sion to ‘‘let’’ Hart go.

But Monday in his office, Dr.
Posvar also said that the person
who hired Hart “cannot escape
the responsibility of that deci-
sion.” The person Dr. Posvar re-
ferred to was of course Mr. Car-
ver.

Dr. Posvar came to Pitt about
eight and one-half years after Mr
Carver. At first, Dr. Posvar ac-
cepted Mr. Carver. Whether he

Noble Hart Ends Panther Career,

Mentor Admits Acting On Impulse 

by ART ROSENGARTEN

Before the bright lights of
three television cameras Dave
Hart held" his final press con-
ference as the head coach of the
University of Pittsburgh football
team.

“My decision to resign was
quite impulsive. but I’m a very
impulsive person,” said Hart.

_“and besides no one tried to stop

11

me.

Hart learned late Sunday night
that the Athletic Committee was
holding a meeting Monday at
noon. “I knew that it was time
for them to decide upon my stat-
us. And more important, it was
time for me to find out exactly
where I stood.”

When he came to work Mon-
day morning, Hart met with Ath-

does now or not is questionable.
One thing is certain. Mr. Carver,
now with a marred record, will
be evaluated. '

UNDER THE present, circum-

stances, that is with Mr. Carvers

as president of the Eastern Co -

legiate Athletic C o n f e r e n c e -

(ECAC), Dr. Posvar will not pass
judgment» on . him. Mr. Carver
will not be fired; '

In all probability, Mr. Carver
will retire right after the winter
term. He is 60 years old, still
finds time to talk to weather beat-
en reporters, and still thinks he’s
doing a damn good job.

But Pitt is now in the Dr. Wes-
ley Posvar Era, His aim is to put
Pitt on the map, at all costs. And
to do this, he knows the football
team must get help from th e
school itself.

IN SPECULATION, Dr . Pos-
var most certainly will attempt:

——-To erase the language require-
ment,

—To install business and physical
education majors, and

—To remove Pitt from the trimes-
ter system and go into some-
thing like a quarter system or
semester system.

Dr. Posvar doesn’t plan to
break-away from the four school
agreement, limiting scholarships
and redshirting. So most certain-
ly, when he speaks of “academic
revolution” here, this must be
what he means.

These are some of those prob-
lems Hart was speaking about
when he was forced to resign.

HART TALKED a lot about
the problems facing a football
coach here. He even says that’s
what got him into trouble more
than anything else. He was hon-
est though, and that’s what wrote
his letter of resignation; he had

integrity too, and that’s what’

signed his name to it.

Funny thing about honest and
honorable men . . . isn’t it?

Est tu Carver.

letic Director Frank Carver in
Hart’s office. After discussing the

past season and possible improve- P

ments‘ for the upcoming one, he
asked Carver exactly where he
stood. “I asked’Mr. Carver about
my status and he didn’t let me
know how he felt. I asked Chan-
cellor Posvar the same question
and received a similar answer. I,
thus received no satisfaction from
either one".

“The only thing that I got
straight was that the University
will compensate me salary
wise,” Hart continued. “When
I found that out. I made up my
mind to resign." A

sponse .to reporters questions.
Hart expressed both disappoint-

Richey Gains
All-American
Harrier Spot

by ED CONLEY

For about a year and-a half,
' now, almost everybody around
here has considered Jerry Rich-
ey an All-American. The star
harrier made it official, yester-
day, coming in sixth in a field of
about 250 at the NCAA cross
countrv championships.

The race, held at the Van Cort-
landt Park course in New York
City, provided the roughest on-
position for Richey since the
Olympic trials a few months
ago.

The winner was a “new face” »

for Richey, Mike Ryan of Air
Force. The cadet found little
problems coming down from the
altitude up at Colorado Springs
as he came in with a time of
29:16.8 for the six-mile run. Rich-
ey was almost a minute behind,-
finishing the race at 29:52.
..The sophomore had never seen
Ryan, but there was a somewhat
familiar sight in front of him.
Steve Stageberg of Georgetown
and Art Dulong of Holy Cross
wound up two-three‘ in the chase.
This same pair was one-two in
the IC4A’s last week, a race that
saw Richey finish fourth. — »

  

resign with a deep regret for the
players which I have recruited
over the past three years.”

Hart's disappointment lay in

his inability to convince people '

of Pitt’s woes in its football pro-
gram. “I tried to fight for the
best programs that I could con-

ceivably get for the boys, but ‘I ‘

failed.”

Hart explained further by say- ‘

ing. “I know that I have made
quite a few enemies in trying to
get things that were out of my

jurisdiction as head football‘
coach. And, certainly voicing my —

opinion the way I did hasn’t help-
ed me.

“I only hope that when a new
coach is appointed that there is
a progressive movement made
for the boys and the athletic pro-

gram,” he continued. In the same r .

vain, Hart feels that his replace.-
ment should be someone ready to
tell what he wants, and not one
who follows orders and past po-
licies to a tee.

One of the greatest hindrances

that Hart found in being the head ,

coach at Pitt was the absence of

someone in the position of a full-

time recruiter. “I think that the

coaches and myself were torn too‘ - I

much away from our coaching
responsibilities, in order ’to re-
cruit and sell Pitt football.”

Als_o looking back on his three
years, Hart felt that there cer-
tainly was some progress made.
“When we came in we had only
40 players to work with; next -sea-
son he'll have over 80 to mold
into a team. Also, he won’t‘hav'e
to practice at Trees Field. “I

kinda wish we were coming into '

it now,” he added sadly.

When asked’ about what he felt
was the single biggest obstacle to
success of football at Pitt, Hart
replied, “Everyone knows th e
problems that exist here and I’m

_ not going to repeat them, but the

situation is like going to a doctor.

If you don’t take the remedy that -.

he prescribes, then you’re not go-
ing to get well.”

Hart made one thing quite spe- , I

cific . . . he was not fired. “Mr.
Carver did not fire me,” he firm-

ly stated. “I might have been.

fired in the near future and play-
ed into their hands by resigning
but I don’t think so... V

With his future completely un- -

decided at the moment, Dave‘
Hart plans to spend some time
with his wife and family, and
maybe even consider, some busi-
ness positions that have been of-''
fered him. But Hart said, “I want
to stay in athletics and hope that
there is an opening for me some-
where.”

When the camera lights final-

ly left David Richard Hart for

the last time at Pitt, he summed
up the way that many of the re-
porters in Trees Hall, room 166,
felt as he said, “I regret that

_, things have worked out this way.“ .,

Please, Don’t Stop With

  Yesterday’s Action
Sport Editor  

Dave Hart went out with class yesterday. He didn’t rap
anybody else. He shouldered more than his share of the
blame. And he hoped the newspapers would do his talking
for him. '

He most certainly didn’t tell it like it is.

Only twice did any comment slip out that could be
construed as hints at the realities behind his resignation.
“I’m the Terry Brennan of Pitt,” hejmentioned, referring
to the hard-luck former Notre Dame coach.

Hart also sighed, “At least he won’t have
to practice at Trees Field anymore.” The
comment passed most of the newsmen by,
but it was a subtle commentary on three
hard-luck years of football.

If you haven’t noticed Trees Field late-
ly, it’s a virtual quagmire One crumbly,
football-sized mudbath that Hart used for
practice facilities because the new prac-

JACOBS

Beginning to see why _it became easier to resign?

It’s a funny thing too, about runners like Denny Fer-
ris and Tony Esposito. Everytime they carry the ball over
20 times on a hundred-plus yards afternoon, they get hurt.
Maybe they’re not conditioned right, but then again, maybe
they’re not getting the right food.

You see, a training table costs an extra $20’ to $30,000
Pitt isn’t willing to spend that kind of extra cash. No atten-
dance, no TV games, and most assuredly, -no bowl games.
No sources of income. I

But unless you put some more money into the program,

foresight to change before their program fell to pieces. Now
they’re making an extra half-million for the season.

Don’t worry. We pressured our coach into resigning;
That ought to do the job. Just like three years ago. "

Even though most people agreethat Chancellor Posvar
and Frank Carver did the’ right thing, the two of them still
somehow look like the villains of the situation. Maybe it’s
because all they did was change personnel.

Look at the official statement elsewhere on the page.

going to be made. Are we to be so naive as to believe that
the entire blame rests on Dave Hart’s shoulders?

The Chancellor did say something about academic re-
evaluation, but he was rather vague. Is this to turn into an-
other empty promise like those of 1965?

Many players were relieved to see their coach go, but
several of them were concerned enough about the situation
to" approach the Chancellor yesterday and suggest that Hart
replace Frank Carver as Athletic Director. They knew that
Hart knows enough about what needs to be done to do an

Their suggestion was sloughed off because making Hart
athletic director would have “bad psychological effects.”
The reasoning must be that it is better to fire two football
coaches in three years, as well as maintain the same admin-
istration that has managed a .395 won-lost percentage the
last four years over all sports.

All this is not to say that Dave Hart was a white knight,
among football coaches. He admits he didn’t get the job
done and that he wasn’t even able to devote full time to his

ways wanted to what was best, not what was most expedient.

It is sad to relate, but this writer had to chuckle to him-
self yesterday at the press conference when Mr. Carver, in
answer to a question said, “I don’t work for Penn State, I
work for Pitt.”

Do you, Mr. Carver? If you do, you’re not doing a very
good job. How can you be so blind as to think that coach-
mg is the total answer? Okay, we’re getting a new coach;
let’s do something else to help him out. Let’s see if you can
work WITH this one. ‘

Perhaps in the past The Pitt News has been too kind to
Dave Hart. But he was the kind of guy who was frank and
friendly and never afraid to face you —- even after a 65-9
loss. He was a different kind of person; the kind it was easy
to like. Talk to him for five minutes and you were covered
with snow.

But he’s gone now, and maybe it was for the best./But
please, for God’s sake, somebody make some more changes
around here. ' ~

‘Sad Day’ In Locker Room;

  Gridders’ Reactions Mixed 1'

by MARTHA HARTLE

Some were surprised, sad;
others were not '— that. seem-
ed to be the general reaction of
Panther football players concern-
ing the resignation of Dave Hart
yesterday. I

“It seemed sudden.” comment- .

ed senior tri-captain Skip Orszu-
lak. “but all the rumors that had
been going around cushioned it.
I didn’t think he would ‘resign
though. It was like a funeral to-
day.”

“I was shocked; i felt bad,”
added Ed Gallin, another senior
captain who saw three years of

varsity action under the depart- I

ed coach.

“It was a sad thing today in
the locker room.” explained Jeff
Brown. “He was a man who real-
ly tried, but . . . it wasn’t all his
fault. He shouldn’t have been
made a scapegoat.”

“I respected him as a person.
but unfortunately many of the
guys felt that as a coach he just
didn’t make it.” continuted the
junior_linebacker. “But even the
players that didn’t like him, you
could tell they felt bad today.
Nobody likes to see a man re-
sign.”

"‘I was sort of surprised, but I
didn’t think it would be this soon
or in this form,” commented
sophomore kicker Joe Spicko. “I
thought there would be a change
but I didn’t think he’d quit. Sev-
enty-five per cent of the prob-
lems weren’t in his hands.

But many were not shocked:

“I wasn’t surprised at his res-
ignation," q u i p p e d sophomore
quarterback Dave Havern. “I fig-
ured with the pressure he could-
n’t do anything but resign. I have

sympathy. for ' him. I’m sorry, to '
, see him go‘. He _was sincere *__to

the end. 1 just hope whoever takes
his place can do a fine job.”

“I don’t think it was all his
fault. It was partly his, partly the
administration and partly the
pl a y e r s ’ attitudes,” continued
Havern. A

“I’m sad to see him go,” added
junior end George Medich, “but
all things considered,he made the
right choice. I really like the guy.
He did a lot for me, but a change
was due. I’m sorry he couldn’t*
have left being a winner.”

“I wasn’t surprised,” agreed

, junior Ray Reppert. “What can

we say? After Saturday, I guess
we.knew something was going to
happen. .I’m sorry to see him
leave the University, but I guess
something had to be done.”

“I hate to see him go,” added
soph tailback Dave Garnett. “It’s
a shame we couldn’t produce un-
der him. He was the reason I
came to.Pitt. He’s a great recruit-
er. I was set on going to Penn
State, but after he talked to me
I changed my mind.”

Many of the freshman gfidders
emphasized Hart’s ability as a re-
cruiter‘and expressed regret at
not getting a chance to play un-
der the man who recruited them.

“I can’t give a personal reac-
tion because I feel we’re going
to win whether or not he’s our
coach,” commented frosh John
Moss. “But I like the man and

he was one of the reasons I came'_5§-

heref’

“I figured he’d be here next
year,” agreed Tony Embessi, Cub
quarterback. “A lot of us came
here because of the respect we
had for him. I thought we could
win under Hart.”

“I was very surprised,” explain-
ed fullback Lou Julian, “and I
felt bad. I hate to see him go.
He’s an honest guy. He’s why I
came here.”

“He recruited us and we re-
spected him. We wanted to play
for him," added split end Steve
Moyer. “I was surprised.”

Surprised or not, Dave Hart is
gone.....

Richey Finishes Sixth

Grant Colehour of Eastern Ken-

riers to finish before Richey.
Others taking All-American hon-
ors were Art Coolidge of Kent
State, Tom Donelly of Villanova.

“Basically, it ‘was the same

_lcourse,’;’- he comment_ed. “It def-

initely helped me. I knew I had
to get away from the pack early.
It got to be about three runners
abreast after awhile.”

That was Richey’s major con-
cern prior to the race -— the first
mile. “We just worked a bit more
on speed,” the harrier stated. “I
wanted to get a good start.

“I was eighth at the mile; that
was good enough,” he added.

He was a bit disappointed with

his finish, however. “I d id ii ’ t‘
