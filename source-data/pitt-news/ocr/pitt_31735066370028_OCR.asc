Panthers Celebrate lrishFiesta, 21-16

By MARK A. SINDLER

SOUTH BEND, Ind. .— They all played to prove a point.

Sure, the Pitt football team walked into “The House that Knute
Rockne Built” to win. But some were there to fight off tradition.

Some still held bitter memories, craving to avenge last season's

mauling of national title hopes.

And even others turned the grass carpeting into sod to make believ-
ers out of the half-dozen or so questioning bowl representatives in

attendance.

Before those former skeptics, a sellout crowd of 59,075 and a CBS
, telecastscanning about 70 percent of the country, Pitt sandwiched
' Notre Dame 2l—l6 early Saturday night in Notre Dame Stadium.

By snapping the lrishmen's five-game winning streak, the Panthers
raised their mark to 7-2 with a fifth consecutive victory by executing
the most streamlined game strategy seen as yet and are now practically
assured of a respectable bowl bid in two weeks,

“We told (the players) all week there’d be no pressure in this game,’
Pitt head coach Foge Fazio said, never thinking twice about suppress-
ing his cavernous smile. “Just get out, play the game and have fun.’

Indeed, Pitt found itself at an amusement park of sorts. There were
too many offensive and defensive stars for Notre Dame to keep track
of. Ever since the Irish won the coin toss and deferred its selection until
the second half, the agonizing began:

0 Quarterback John Congemi discovered a new deep threat in
previously underrated split end Bill Wallace, who corralled a 44-yard
TD pass at 8:44 into the first quarter. '

Cheating

U112 lair! New

PracticeBecoming Acceptable?

By JOE zsrr

Cheating is a significant problem
confronting the College of Arts and
Sciences, according to Barry Appl-
baum, assistant director of the Uni-
versity Honors Program.

Applbaum teaches a course called
CAS-2, an introduction to the uni-
versity for freshmen in the honors
program. He asked his class last
week how many had ever cheated .in
school.

All 20 students raised their hands.

“I was kind of amazed to see that
many people raise their hands,”
Applbaum said. “Cheating is mor-
ally reprehensible. It’s a crime. Yet
everyone admits to doing it.”

“What does this say about us as a
group of people, as a society?”

One CAS freshman, who asked to
remain anonymous, said he cheated
on a midterm exam in an introduc-
tory math course. His interests lie in
psychology, and he has a history of
below-average performance in
math. ’

“I wouldrft have cheated, but -1
had to pull a C or better to go on," he

I said. “Plus, I didn’t know the mate-
rial that well."

The test was administered in an
auditorium containing 200-300 stu-
dents. The student said he had ‘last

year’s midterm, which he received
from a friend, tucked beneath his
test and notes scribbled on his note-

book under his seat.

A teacher’s aide stood behind the
student during_the exam. She put
her hand on his shoulder after he

whispered something to another
student.

After class, the aide asked both .

students to write their names on a
sheet of paper. As of yesterday, they
had not been reprimanded.

“I don’t even know whether she

told the instructor or not,” the stu- .

dent, who received a low C on the
exam, said. '

, Applbaum said many instructors
“tolerate” cheating. _

“I know that some faculty
members accept it as a way of life,"
he said. “They feel it just exists and
what can you do about it?”

What can be done and what is
being done are two separate issues.

According to a flyer published by
the chancellor‘s office entitled
“Guidelines on Academic Integrity,”
a student, if found guilty of cheating
by the judicial board, can be
imposed one of six sanctions.

The sanctions range in severity
from “dismissal from the university
without expectation of readmission”
to “reduction in grade or assignment
of a failing grade on the paper or
examination in which the offense
occurred.” _ ' A

Few cases even find their way to
the judicial board. If an instructor
wrongly accuses a student of cheat-
ing without concrete evidence, the
student could sue in court for defa-
mation charges.

“It’s pretty hard to find evidence
that someone’s cheating, especially
the kind of cheating where someone
looks at someone else’s paper,"
Applbaum said. “That’s not the kind
of evidence that will stand up in a
court of law.

“If I accuse you of cheating, and
you make a big deal out of it and
take me to court, it’s true that the
university will sdpport me and pro-
vide me with an attorney. But do I
need that grief?" '

Applbaum rationalizes that‘

cheating could be considered good
preparation for the real world. The
assumption of many is that people
cheat on their income taxes, stu-
dents cheat on their tests and politi-
cians cheat to get elected.

University of Minnesota showed

Misconduct
. By l,'iE_CGY'FER,R|i

A Pitt mathematics professor
who had — been attending a
seminar in Moscow has been
expelled, apparently for speak-
ing with dissident Jewish scient-
ists, according to reports in The
New York Times.

Professor Norman J. Zabusky .
was expelled from the Soviet
Union on Friday. The Soviet
Academy of Scientists called
Zabusky’s conduct “incompati-
ble with the status of a guest of
the Academy on an official
exchange.”

Chairman of Pitt’s mathemat- ’
ics and statistics department Wil-
bur Deskins said the expulsion is
an example of political and reli-
gious harassment, not academic.‘
Zabusky had participated in
seminars where he-was -in contact
with dissidents before and had
been involved in efforts to bring

decided not to participate as a
way of protesting the recent .

Homeless, Exile Reflects  

On Country’s Civil War  

By MARTY WILLIS

At age 16, Ana Yolando went to
work in a Texas Instrument factory
in her homeland of El Salvador,
where she tried to organize the
workers, who were mostly women,
into a union.

“I worked for six years trying to
improve the wages and living condi-
tions of the "workers there,” she said,
explaining that the daily wage was
only three or four dollars. Women
employees who became pregnant
lostany right to work, she added.

When the nation’s workers held a
general strike demanding an end to
governmental repression in March
of 1980, her factory was occupied by
the Salvadoran military. All of its
union leaders were fired three days
later, she said.

Soon afterwards, many factories
closed their doors permanently, lay-
ing off thousands of workers. The

growing rate of unemployment,
which Yolando said has now

reached 50 percent, forced her and .
many others into a difficult choice I

—- joining the guerrilla ‘war in the

countryside or going into exile. Her 

decision to leave the country wasia
painful one, she explained.’

“I, for example, had to leave 
behind my two children, one two, 
years old and one four years old. It’s , 
been three and a half years since I’ve | I I

seen them. Mine is the case of

hundreds of throusands of Salvado— ‘ K

rans who have had to leave behind
their family members,” she said.‘

' If the American people knew the’

truth about El Salvador’s civil war,
they would support the struggle of
the Salvadoran people, according to

Writer Reflects On Her Beginnings

' . [By ANA PUGA

How to grow and yet preserve and
learn from your past is the conflict
novelist Paule Marshall identifies as
central to her novels and to her life.

, Marshall read excerpts from her
new novel, “Praisesong for the
Widow,” and from her first novel,
“Browngirl Brownstone,” in the last
of the lecture series “Focus: Women
on Women” at Carlow College last
Thursday.

“I grew up among poets,” Mar-
shall said, “Now they didn’t look like
poets — whatever poets are sup-
posed to look like. They were just a
group of ordinary housewives, my
mother and three or four of her
friends who dressed in shapeless
housedresses in the summer and
frumpy coats in the winter."

These black women, immigrants
from Barbados, worked as domes-
tics for middle-class white house-
wives in Flatbush. The fortunate
ones had regular jobs, and the others
would wait on certain designated
corners for the white housewives in
the neighborhood to hire them for
the day. After work, they returned to
Brooklyn, where they gathered in
the kitchen of Marshall's mother’s
brownstone to discuss everything
from their employers to the politics
and economics of the day, Marshall
said.

“As a little girl, I sat at a table,
being seen and not heard, as was the
custom in those days, listening to my
first teachers in the narrative art.
They taught me the power and mys-

tery and beauty of ordinary speech,”
Marshall said.

“God don’ love ugly, and he ain’t
stuck on pretty," Marshall quoted
from the poets in the kitchen. They
used that phrase to describe how evil
exists along with good in this world,
to explain the oppression they saw
around them, Marshall said.

“A pregnant woman was ‘tum-
bling big.‘ Or a woman a little too
free with her sexual favorswas ‘a

thoroughfare.’ ” Marshall described
the poets’ inventiveness and daring
with language.

The poets were ‘black, female and
foreigners. Powerless in American
society, they fought back with their
only weapon — the spoken word.
They were constantly creating art,
Marshall said.

“In this man’s world, you got to
take-your mouth and make a gun!"
Marshall quoted her mother.

At the Macon St. branch of the
Brooklyn Public Library, Marshall
discovered the written word. The
classics, Thackery, Dickens and
Fielding were her favorites. But she
sensed a lack until she came across a
book of poems by Paul Lawrence
Dunbar, Marshall said.

“Little brown-baby wit spa’klin
eyes / Come to yo’ pa-ppy and set on
his knee,” Marshall read from
Dunbar.

“This poem reminded me of my
father and me; this poem was about
something that was close to me,”
Marshall said.

For the first time, she realized the
similarity between the West Indian
black and the American black lan-
guage and -experience, Marshall
said.

Seen my lady home last night/
Jump back, honey, jump back. / Hel’
huh han’ an’ squez it tight.., Mar-
shall read from Dunbar.

Dunbar gave herthe courage to
go up to the white librarian and ask
about other black writers, and Dun-

T bar inspired her to try to capture the

spirit of the poets in the kitchen,
Marshall said.

In her first novel, “Browngirl
Brownstone,” Marshall depicted the

struggle for independence ofa black
girl growing up in Brooklyn.

“I tried to break away from the
flat stereotype of black.women in the
literature. I gave Selina [the protag-
onist] a consciouness and an interior
life not solely defined by racism,”
Marshall said.

In “Praisesong,” Marshall
stressed the theme of returning to
one’s past.

“Avey Johnson is a middle-aged,
middle-class black woman who has

made it. Avey is the type of woman,

who wouldn't be caught without her
white gloves, her hat and her pearls.
Avey is a CTTR [credit to the race],"
Marshall described the novel's
protagonist.

Avey has a house in White Plains,

I stocks, bonds and a secure job.

Every year, she takes a vacation
cruise to the Caribbean with two
friends and six pieces of matched
luggage. But one year during her
vacation, Avey has a dream so dis-
turbing that it makes her decide to
return home a week early.

“The dream generates an odyssey
of self-discovery; it stages a private
revolution in Avey,” Marshall said.

Avey starts thinking for the first
time in her life, wondering if the
things she and her husband have
relinquished in order to make it in
the white world were worth it, Mar-
shall said.

Marshall is also the author of
“Soul Clap Hands and Sing," and
‘“The Chose Place; the Timeless Peo-
ple.” She will teach literature at the
University of California at Berkeley
in the spring.

“The war [now four years old] has
been prolonged because of U.S.
intervention  the only way the
struggle can come to an end is if the

- government of the United States

"Naturalization Service

ceases ‘its intervention,” Yolando
said Friday, speaking before an
audience of about 25 at the Oakland
Women’s Center.

Speaking the next day before a
gathering of 200 at Carlow College,
she said, “We [Salvadorans] know
how to distinguish between the peo-
ple of the United States and the
government of the United States.
We know that you are a peace-
loving and freedom-loving people.
~You’re a powerful and strong people

and you have the power to stop this

intervention.”

The civil war, which began in
October, 1979, has
roughly 1 million refugees, mainly
concentrated in the other Central
American countries and in the U.S.,
Yolando said.

These figures were confirmed Sat-
urday by Art McDonald ofthe Tho-
mas Merton Center, who estimated
that about 500,000 Salvadorans are
now in the U.S., with about half of
them in the Los Angeles area.

McDonald estimated that only 5
percent of this group is legally recog-
nized as political refugees and that
the rest are living “underground" in
‘he U.S. This is because only 5-10
percent of all Salvadorans who have
applied to the U.S. Immigration and
have
received asylum, the remainder have
been deported, according to
McDonald. The majority of the
refugees do not even bother to apply
for asylum, choosing instead to
remain underground rather than
risking deportation, he explained.

Since 1980, about I000 Salvador-
ans .have been deported per month
for a total of about 40,000 so far,
McDonald estimated. Yolando said
that some of the deported, who are
usually flown from California and
Arizona to San Salvador, the capi-
tal, have been shot to death at the
airport upon arrival.

Yolando’s remarks were con-
firmed Saturday by Gabriel, a Sal-
vadoran refugee who, along with his
wife, Maria, has been staying for
several months at the Pittsburgh
Mennonite Church in Point Breeze
as, part of a nationwide “sanctuary”
program. A

Gabriel reported that photos of
some of those killed at the airport
have been printed in the local news-
papers as an example of what can
happen to those who dare to leave
the country.

When asked under what condi-
tions he and his wife, who have left
their nine children behind, would
return to El Salva_dor, Gabriel rep-
lied, “There would have to be a
change of government. The massa-
cre isn’t stopping.”

Yolando, who is also an illegal
alien, said that there is always the
possibility of people like herself and

. Gabriel being deported and killed. “I

feel that I’m running a risk, but I feel

‘ that it’s necessary for the struggle.

.'~\

Somebody has to reach out to the
people of the United Statesand tell
them the truth.” '

cheated in college. Applbaum
believes that similar ﬁgures would
be reflected in tests here.

Applbaum, a 1969 Pitt graduate,
confessed that even he had cheated
in college.

“Not in the sense of cheating on a
test or cheating on an exam, but in
the sense of getting help in writing
papers, things like that,” he said. “I
think there were times when I turned‘
in papers not sufficiently my work to
call my work.”

Cheating has become such a com-
mon matter that even a college
instructor admits to it. Grade school
teachers preach that by cheating,*a
student is only cheating himself.

Part of Zabusky’s stated rea-

Funding
Questions  

The Student Government Board and its Allocations
Committee seem to be confused as to their own proce-
dure, and may be hurting many Pitt students in the
process.

For the fourth time in as many weeks, the board
could not decide whether or not to fund Pitt’s annual
Writers’ Conference. The Allocations Committee has
rejected the $2,000 funding request on the grounds
that it does not fund conventions. At the weekly meet-
ing on Thursday, three board members accepted the
committee’s recommendation and three rejected it —
keepingthe issue in limbo once again.

Allocations chairman Steve Smith said that the con-
ference is a convention. Yet if the word were looked up
in the dictionary, as SGB committees are fond of
doing, one would find that a convention means “an
assembly, a formal meeting.” That deﬁnition disquali-
ties the Writers’ Conference.

The Writers’ Conference offers a unique opportun-
ity for Pitt students to meet, listen to and talk with
literary giants in all fields of writing. Participants in
the past have_ included Pulitzer Prize-winners such as
David Halberstam and Galway Kinnell (now a teach-
ing fellow at Pitt) plus writers such as Toni Morrison
and journalists from The New York Times, Rolling.
Stone, Blayboy, New Yorker and many other presti-
gious publications.

By bringing these people to the university, not only
arestudents able to benefit from them, but the univer-
sity as a whole receives better public relations and is
seen as having a literary community.

Another complaint by the Allocations'Committee is .

that the conference attracts people other than stu-
dents, faculty and staff. Yet, those that do.not work for
or attend the university pay a $5 ticket fee to attend the
convention, thereby generating money for‘ the
university. ‘

The Student Activities Fee pays for many necessary
and unnecessary events and conventions. Black Week,
which began yesterday, is an example of a necessary
event.

The Student Activities Fee pays for some of the
events and speakers brought in for Black Week. These
speakers and events will attract a large audience out-
side of. the Pitt community. Yet, there is only one
event, a concert, where those “outsiders” have to pay a
fee. All of the other events and lectures are open to the
public.

This seems a bit paradoxical and contradictory. If
SGB will help fund Black Week, it should also help
fund the Writers’ Conference. I

SGB also spends thousands of dollars every year for
retreats and conventions for other student groups. The
board itself spends a weekend every January in a hotel
in Monroeville to “learn how to be effective leaders.”

Letters To The Editor

Capita|ism,Communism,Wars

Dear Editor:

Reading Kevin Bold’s letter “Not
Based On Principles,” Oct. 3l, Pitt
News, has prompted me to submit

this letter. Mr. Bold speaks of how _

much the capitalist system benefits
the individual most. ‘ i

I would like,Mr. Bold -to compare
incidents of murder, rape, robbery,
mental illness, etc. in the United
States to that of the'Soviet Union.

The presidence of “private” profit
has instilled standards of abuse to
the overall health of millions of
Americans with “tailored” agencies
such as the EPA, AEC, AMA, NCI,
etc. , ,\
Mr. Bold stresses how “fascistic
and repressive” any left wing
government is in regard to “human
rights.” Of course, the austerity of
Marxist systems has nothing to do
with American tactics in destabliz-
ing governments not in tune to her
interests.

On Sept. 20, former Soviet
ambassador Arkady Schevchenko
spoke at Pitt before a packed audito-

rium. The American government,

paid a huge sum of money to encour-
age this man to defect to the U.S.
Can it be contended that this was a
legitimate portentious propaganda
ploy to bolster public support for
arms deployment against the Soviet
Union?

Admittedly, much of the Soviet
“super power” game is ominous, like
the Soviet army’s occupation in
Afghanistan or the threat hovering‘
over Red China or the forbiddance

Missing A

The do-gooders have struck
again! Late last week, Pitt’s Office of
Student Activities cancelled the
National Collegiate Driving Cham-
pionships. After the competition
was planned for a month, Student
Activities, in all it inﬁnite wisdom,
decided at the last minute that the
event would “put students at a
disadvantage."

The reasoning behind this was
that Bigelow Blvd., the intended site
of the competition, is a main thor-
oughfare for Pitt's 87 percent com-
muter population. If Student
Activities is so concerned about
commuters, why haven't they ever

of Russian immigration to name a
few, but I believe this letter serves in
best interest to the truth regarding
the likelihood of nuclear conflict in
the foreseeable future.

The wars that Americans fought
and died in were an awful tragedy by
which the sacrifice for liberty was a
valiant will of men and women to

“I would /ike...to com-
pare incidents of
murder, rape, robbe-
ry, mental illness, etc.
in the United States to
that of the Soviet
Union.” a

survive. The genocide methods of

Nazi Germany had shocked the
world as well as the atomic bombs

‘ dropped on Japan by the U.S., and

Russia lost millions of people in
WW II. . ,
People in other parts of the world
today are fighting just as valiantly
for their survival. Why should a
wealthy minority backing itself by
virtue of the American people’s
sense of loyalty and at the risk of
horrible war, launch a presidence
over the world’s wealth? These peo-
ple, blind with power, garb them-
selves with the principles of what
brought America to be. This is false
honor that warps the dedication that
constitutes those ideals. '

Who are the people whose power
and decisions are bringing us closer
to the brinkof nuclear war? Televi-
sion has become a shrewd device to
manipulate and “fix” moral consen-
sus to the aims of Zionist interests,
namely war conditioning.

Many"of Americais wealthy with
their conservative supporters are
willing to take a nuclear risk tergrip
those sources and world conditions
necessary to generate exorbitant

. capital. Communism is inadvertent-

ly perpetrated through the exploita-
tion of Third World countries.
Rather than encouraging ,real
reform through economic i,nde.p.end-
ence, the capitalist policy makers
suppress the popular struggles of
say, Latin Americans out of their
gross impoverishment and subjuga-
tion with force resulting in syste-
matic murder.

After their devastating imperial-
ism in Lebanon, U.S. and-Israel, in
the guise of fighting communism,
installed a government that
appeases Israel’s insidious expan-
sion and establishes American cor-
porate interests. Why should Russia
have any less right to resist fascism
in the guise of democratic national- ‘
ism as a threat to, its security? These
extremes need to be tempered, not
augmented. ,

America’s.ruling elite can have
their cake and eat it to by stuffing
nuclear missiles down Russia’s-
throat.

Soviet indoctrination. Nationalism

College Experience

done anything about the horrendous
parking situation? I’m sure traffic
could have been re-routed as it was
for our precious Homecoming
parade. ‘

Student Activities director Andy
Smith said that another reason why
the event was cancelled was that
there was no precedent for the car
competition at Pitt. This is a ridicu-
lously narrow-minded attitude.
Would Andy Smith decline sex with
Christie Brinkley just because he’d
never had it/before?

I suspect the true reason was
much more childishly motivated.
The coordinators of the event, Cam-
pus Dimensions, went through all
the official channels(.Dept. of Public

Works, Office of Risk Management,
campus police) except the Office of
Student Activities. I suspect the veto
given to the event by‘ those mature
folks at Student Activities was
nothing more than sour grapes for
not being consulted.

I, for one, am ticked off about the

whole thing. A lot of people were .,

looking forward to a lot of fun and a
chance to compete against students

from all over the country in Daytona -

Beach. Thank you, Office of Student
Activities, for a rich college expe-
rience we never had.

Looking Up

Idea A Move Away
From Democracy-

Dear Editor:

In The Pitt News’opinion sec-
tion of Nov. 4, Stephen J. Lubas
insists that a statistical survey be
taken before the SGB comments
on the American military pres- H
ence in Lebanon and Grenada. I
assume that Mr. Lubas has also
requested that Sen. John Heinz
refrain from any senate vote
before he surveys the entire state
population. However disturbing
this may be to Mr. Lubas, the
SGB is not elected to stand on
corners and collect signatures.
Instead, they are democratically
elected representatives of the stu-
dent body. As representatives,
board members have the right to
interpret student opinion as they
see fit.

If Mr. Lubas is unhappy with
Mr. Delmontagne’s position, he
has 'many options available to
make his point heard. He may

use the media, talk to SGB
members and its president, make
an appointment to speak at a
public meeting or vote in the
SGB election. In effect, Mr.
Lubas can try to persuade board
members that theirs is the minor-

ity opinion.’ If he wants to be _—

really effective, he could even

‘ stand on the corner collecting

signatures for his own personal
survey of student opinion.

The notion that everyone must
be consulted before action is
taken is only practical where few
people are concerned. That is
why representative democracy
evolved from town hall meetings.
The adherence to Mr. Lubas’
suggestion would be a move
away from democracy rather
than towards it.

Grenada Invasion AndTuition

By J.P.' MARRA

My friend Sparky ran towards me
yesterday as I was strolling toward
the C. of L. “Hey, J.P.,” he shouted.
“Wait up! I've got something to tell
you."

So I waited for him, and soon he
was at my side, panting. “Listen,”he
said. “You know how we’ve been
complaining all term about the high
cost of tuition?” I nodded. Tuition
sure does take a big bite from one’s
beer budget around here.

“Well, listen. I’ve got an idea. I
know how we can get Uncle Sam to
foot part of our bill. Wanna hear it?”

I admit, I was interested in hear-
ing what he had to say. I told him to
continue.

“Do you know about what’s going
on in Grenada?”

I nodded and said that I was ,

vaguely aware that we had sent a
couple of divisions of Marines down
there or something like that.

“Well, did you hear that the U.S.
has declared‘ Grenada eligible for
three million dollars in immediate
cash to help clean up? And they’ll get
lots more later. All because they
tried to become a puppet of Marx-
ism. Now, doesn't that make you
think?”

I told him that I don’t know much
about puppetry, so I wasn’t sure
what he wanted -me to be thinking.

“Don‘t be stupid. Do you realize
that’s at least. 300 bucks for every
resident of Grenada? And probably

. a whole lot more! Do you see what

I’m getting at?“

Again, I was forced to plead
stupidity.

“Jeez, J.P., you’re thick. If our
government gives that much money
away to foreigners, how much do
you think they'd give to American
citizens like you and me?”

I replied that I didn’t know, but as
we hadn’t been personally overrid-
den by any Red hoardes lately, our

chances of reaping any monetary
benefits from the USA were quite
slim.

“That’s my whole idea, dummy.’
He was getting pretty excited by
now. “I get my brother to take over
my house and proclaim it a Marxist
state. I have him overthrow my par-
ents, abolish private property and
set up a provisional government,
promising to turn power and Tippy,
the dog, back over to the rest of us as

9

soon as we’re able to handle the
responsibility. '
g “While/he's doing that, I call the
Pentagon, talk to Cap, get him to

convince Ronny that he‘s in danger »

of losing still another part of the
world to communisn, and what do
you think he’ll do?" ‘

I said that, knowing Mr. Reagan,
he would likely have troops at Spar-
ky’s door by nightfall.

He slapped me on the back.
“Exactly. Ronny sends a couple
dozen Marines, they storm our

house, break a few lamps, kick the
dog and bootimy brother out.”

I remarked that this seemed to be
a rather harsh way to deal with one’s
brother. “

“Nah, He’s leaving the house any-
way. Got his girlfriend pregnant this

past summer. Anyway, the Marines ,

leave, reinstall my dad asthe head of
the house, and instantly, we qualify
for money from Uncle Sam. I figure
at 500 bucks a head, and that’s con-
servative — remember — we’re no
foreigners; our family could make at
least $3,000. Since it was my idea,
naturally, I’d keep a percentage, say
90, and redistribute the rest to my

family. I’d have half a year's tuition,”

room and board left over, easy!”

I agreed that the plan seemed to
make sense.

“Listen, J .P. You can write about
all this because I want to help out
our fellow students, too. Just give-

me time to pull this off first. I figure ” ‘I ' if

that if enough people call in the

Marines, pretty soon the. govern-'_.

ment might catch on and then the - . --

scam would be called off. Hey, I‘ve
gotta fly.

“I'm off to the bookstore to pick '

up a copy-of the ‘Communist Mani-
festo.’ I'm going to give it to my

brother so he can spout rhetoric and ' I
party slogans and covince' the . V "

Marines that they're keeping the, ‘

world safe for democracy. See ya!”

So hey. If some of you want to
give this a try, wait a week, ok? For
Sparky‘s sake. I‘d give it a shot
myself, but no one‘s scheduled to
leave our house for a while. And
next time I walk into Zelda’s with
two bucks to my name, and you’re
rolling in dough thanks to me,
Sparky and communism, think of
me, ok? '

Just one note of caution. Don’t

hold us responsible if the Marines ’

decide to stay.

Capitalism, Communism, Wars

is indoctrination. Of course, The
Soviet form is bad and America’s is
good because its indoctrination is
for “freedom.” “Freedom” in Amer-
ica means to have choice within the
limits of a plutocratic government.
Values are obviously not exchange-
ble between America and Russia,
but is all this human oppression res-
tricted to just the Soviet citizenry? In
America, how far are we removed
from what collectively represented
we are? The defense complex as an
intercourse between public officials
and corporate heads in the arms
industry is a fraud perpetrated on
the American taxpayer. Our-politi-
cal system is designed to diffuse the
will of the masses. What’s the differ-
ence between people conditioned to
support their own tyranny or a sys-

tern enacting direct tyranny? “Free-
dom” is relative, not absolute, as in
regard to the American version.
The degree of toleration between
capitalism and communism rests on
the outcome of power in the hands
of a few men, not the altruism of

' democracy versus a world maligned '

with communism. Although Ameri-
cans enjoy the highest standard of
living in the world, this system is
plagued with myriad ills. The lottery
is no solution in a country ripe for
revolution. We need real redistribu-
tion of wealth. Even though these
following examples are obviously
idealistic measures and drastic prop-

osals, they are far from impossible in
view of what the consequences of a
nuclear war would mean!

The U.S. should abandon its
multi-national businesses in the
Third World and remove all its mil-
itary personnel from every area of
the world other than her own coun-
try. The world is ready for a break in
the bind of U.S. international order.
Let the billionaires capitulate to
socialist forces. These so-called
“super powers,” the U.S. and
U.S.S.R., then concede total spheres
of inﬂuence to the United Nations
and shape a world government that
is continously checked equally by all

countries. _
are then allowed the natural devel-

" opment, access and marketability of

their resources regardless of dura-
tion. America should draw upon
independent means of energy, even
if it must do away with fuel emission
vehicles and bring back the horse.
People would not be expected to
give up what property they earned in
a lifetime, and some positive aspects
of free enterprise would be retained,
but a gradual transition to a socialist
means of production and distribu-
tion would ensue.

Capitalism accentuates unfairness I ‘

out of the natural variation inherent
in nature. Generating superiority
does not outweigh the void left in
society. Competitive belligerence is
ingrained in our education as part of
the culture resulting in much aliena-
tion through a cold, cruel, insensi-
tive butchery of the emotions.

Black Week:

ay'sAvoNA BAILEY

The l4th Annual Black Week
began last night with a celebration of
gospel music at the Bellefield
Church under the theme “Unity: The
Basis From Which All Efforts
Transcend.”

Speakers during the week will

include Angela Davis, Stokely Car-
michael (Kwame Ture), Benjamin

. Hooks, Gil Scott-Heron and Dick
Gregory.

Davis is the 1984 vice-presidential
candidate for the Central Commit-
tee of the U.S. Communist Party.
Her human rights involvement
began when she witnessed a bomb-
ing of a Birmingham, Ala., church in
September, 1963, by members of the
Ku Klux Klan that left three young
girls dead. Davis is a magnum cum
Iaude graduate of Brandeis Univer-
sity. She travelled to Germany to
finish her advanced course work,
and when she returned to the U.S.,
Davis joined her present political
organization. Davis has been fired
twice from the Board of Regents in
California. ’

The_Pitt News, Monday, November 7, I983

Carmichael (Kwame Ture) is the
leader of the All African People’s
Revolutionary Party. Carmichael
has been involved with civil and
human rights since the l960’s and is
also the originator of the phrase
“Black Power." He has been
involved in college sit-ins and was
the founder of the S.N.C.C. (Stu-
dent Non-Violent Coordinating
Committee). Working with the
Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, he built grass-root net-
works around politics, education
and social programs. He has worked
with the United Farmers Associa-
tion, supported the Indian rights
movement andauthored two books:
“Black Power,” with Charles Hamil-
ton; and “Stokely Speaks: From
Black Power to Pan Africanism."

Benjamin Hooks, the executive
director of the NAACP, will also be
speaking during Black Week. Hooks
was a public defender in Memphis,
Tenn., and was later elected as judge
of the criminal courts in Shelby
County, Tenn. He served eight terms
before combining his law back-
ground with the ministry in 1956.

at 125th and Lenox.”

Dick Gregory, noted comedian,
human rights activist, social satirist,
author, lecturer, philosopher and
recording artist, will speak Tuesday.
Gregory is known as a civil rights
activist, a fighter for world peace,
hunger and native American rights.
Gregory ran from Chicago to
Washington, D.C., for world hunger
in 1972 and fasted 145 days during
the Iranian Hostage crisis.

According to Sarah Brown, the,

former adviser to the Black Action
Society, Black Week was started by
ex-Pitt student Wayne Lawson.

“The week developed out of a
need for minority cultural programs
due to limited amount of programs
offered to black students,” said
Brown.

The purpose of the week was to
honor black people and show their
contributions to fellow students and
the community. Brown said the stu-
dents hoped to rally together and
have a period of celebration.

She compared Black Week to
Black History Month and said that
the last week in November was
chosen because there was very little
to do during the fall term and it filled
the social gap.

“The focus of Black Week this
year is to unify black students,” said
Daryl Davis, chairman of the Black
Action Society. According to Davis,
black students have formed cliques
and are separating among them-
selves, particularly into Greek and
non-Greek factions.

Other than raising students’ con-
sciousness, the Black Action Society
hopes Black Week will increase stu-
dent motivation. Only a handful of
students are involved with the

organization, but Davis doesn’t see
the problem as one of apathy.

“Before you can be apathetic, you
have to know your situation.” he
said.

Greg Ray, deputy chairman for
the Black Action Society, believes
Black Week is another step in a
“great tradition” that BAS has
always tried to present to the com-
munity and university.

James Raymond, the new adviser
for BAS, said he feels “super”about

Benjamin Hooks

being involved with Black Week and
working with the students.

“The week is long, but that's what
we are trying to do — bring students
together,‘-’._ he said. “Blacks have
been trying for 400 years to become
unified, and with the system opening
up, we can do what we have to do.”

The Black Week theme ties in with
what BAS is attempting to do —
that is, bring together other groups,
both Greek and independent, such
as P.O.M.S. (Premedical Organiza-
tion for Minority Students) and the
Black Engineering Council.

Raymond doesn’t foresee any ’

changes in Black Week, but he does
believe that the event should serve as
a kickoff rather than an ending.

The week will be evaluated by
Raymond, and the need to resched-
ule events at other times in the future
will be considered.

“Most of the students are tired
after Black Week and the step
show,” he said, “and I would like to
see that changed.”

Last month, a new publication
was introduced to Pittsburgh by
Business Communications, Inc.
(BCI) — its focus, the light side
of Pittsburgh.

“We want to celebrate Pitts-
burgh in City Tab,” editor Patty
Tascarella said. “I think a lot of
publications in the city have got-
ten away from covering
Pittsburgh.”

Tascarella is a 1979 Pitt gradu-
ate and had been on the staff of
The Pitt News since her fresh-
man year.

Michael E. Romanus, pub-
lisher of City Tab and president
of BCI, conceived the idea for a
city-wide magazine like the City
Tab. _, .

City Tab, a cross between a
magazine and a tabloid, as Tas-
carella called it, will be the city’s
largest monthly with a distribu-
tion of 55,000.

City Tab currently has over
300 distribution points through-
out the city, Tascarella said. New
additions will be released by mid-
month.

Tascarella said she hopes to
make Pittsburgh and the publi-
cation “accessible to the people."

“I don’t want to be a snobbish
publication," she said. Tascarella
doesn't want City Tab to cut off

. now,

some people because of eco-
nomic status or educational
background. But “it's a tough
line‘ to walk,” she said.

The concept behind City Tab
is no lengthy articles. “You can
pick it up, put it down, pick it up,
put it down and hopefully, pick it
up again,” Tascarella said. Arti-
cles will be about 800 words
maximum, she said.

Eventually, City Tab will
cover heavier issues, but for right
they will be feature-
oriented, Tascarella said.

She said there is a “method to
the madness." According to Tas-
carella, it would, be wrong to
come out with criticism about
potholes, City Council, the
inconvenience of construction in
the city or the Pirates. People
need to know who you are and
where you are coming from first,
she said.

She also noted that it is hard to
write about dynamic issues
because City Tab is a monthly
publication.

A monthly must be more selec-
tive, Tascarella said, because
each story should be applicable
within the given time frame of

each issue. _ _
‘‘I think there IS room in the

city for another publication,”
Tascarella said. She attributes
this to the fact that there is really

no other publication like City
Tab — one that does mainly
features.

Although she wants City Tab
to be different, Tascarella said
that she would want to have
strong alliances with the other
publications in the city. She
named for example, the Pitts-
burgh Business Times and area
college newspapers. The Busi-
ness Times had some of its staff
show up to “cheer us on" at our
debut party, Tascarella said.

0 Tailback Joe McCall, playing

this season, unleashed a 116-yard
running attack, including touch-
down gallops of IO and one yards.

0 An effectively blitzing and all-
over-the-place Pitt defense held
ND’s top rusher, Allen Pinkett, to
under 100 yards (only the second
defense to do so this season),
allowed ND’s freshman QB, Steve
Beuerlein, three completions for 44
yards in the first half before being
replaced in the fourth quarter and
altered the arc of eight passes.

I And backup QB Chris Jelic sub-
bed for Congemi the entire second
half after the latter suffered a mild
concussion in the second quarter
when Duane Spielmaker turned his
head into a drill for a nine-yard sack.

Everything, it might be added,
clicked for a Pitt team that in the
past found itself pushing buttons
and not always receiving the -right
products. ‘

The Panthers, on their second ser-
ies, wasted no time in culminating a
61-yard drive when Congemi hit
Wallace at Notre Dame’s eight.

“It was a line route up the side-

' line,” said Wallace, who brushed-off

a hit by cornerback Pat Ballage and
danced in for six points, the PAT
later missed by Pat Viancourt. “I
slipped the ball in after getting out-
side the defensive back.”

Notre Dame had not allowed a
scoring pass for the previous 22

' quarters it played.

When defensive end Al Wengli-
kowski forced a Pinkett fumble on
the lrishmen’s next series, Congemi
wore the clock down.by 46 seconds
before handing off to McCall, who
sped left 10 yards in.

Fazio opted for the two-point
conversion, Congemi set up, hit
Marc Bailey open on the right ﬂat,
and Pitt was ahead I4-0 after Bailey
bounced off defenders Joe Johnson
and Mike Golic.

breakdown, Faust stuck by him,

the third quarter when he matched
up with Milt Jackson for 27 yards.
Four plays later (8:41), ND con-
verted a 37-yard field goal, making
the score I4-3.

Beuerlein completed three more
passes in his next drive, ending with
a 22-yard conversion.

Beuerlein’s next drive ended when
Pitt’s Benson soared into the air and
intercepted a pass intended for split
end Joe Howard after Beuerlein set
up seven yards from the goal line.

But Faust had seen enough Pitt

an overthrown heave intended for
Howard and picked up a 25-yard

interception return with 7:45

Blair Kiel, benched since an

interception-marred performance in
Miami six weeks ago, started ND’s
next drive and ended it as the pre-
vious two had when Benson picked

“We knew what we had to do
when we came here," Hill said for
the defenses part. “With those
thoughts of last year (Notre Dame
winning 31-16 at Pitt Stadium), we
came down here with a mission.”

“The coaches called a superb
game,” strong safety Ray Weather-
spoon said. “The players just exe-
cuted it.”

77- yard TD drive that ended with a
five-yard flip to Pinkett, Pitt had

shifting after the 12- or2l-yard burst

SOUTH BEND, Ind. — Never
did a team effort have so much
bearing.’ '

And it couldn’t have come at a
more opportune moment.

Despite a late fourth-"quarter
surge by Notre Dame, Pitt’s 21-l6
domination of the Fighting Irish
never once relied on luck. A total
team effort throughout proved con-
clusive in the margin of victory.

From Joe McCall’s rushing ll6
yards to Bill Wallace’s clutch recep-
tions thoughout, the Panthers
played with the intensity of a
national championship-caliber‘
team.

In addition to the surprising con-
sistency of the Pitt offense, the Pitt
defense shut the door on the Irish
attempts to get back into the game.

From an individual standpoint,
the Panthers had plenty of backs to

pat.
II! It *

Prior to the contest Saturday
afternoon, the Panthers had a big
question mark on the offense.

I-low successful could the offense
perform without the services of All-
America candidate flanker Dwight
Collins?

The answer was to come in the
name and performance of junior
split end Bill Wallace. The 6-2, 190-
lb. Wallace provided the offense
with the big play punch that —was
expected to be missing.

“All of us, the whole receiving
corps, knew it was up to us to pick

as whole. The corners were coming‘

up, the ends were containing.”

“Our defense was designed to
directly stop him,” Weatherspoon
said of Pinkett. “They have other
good players, but if you stop Pin-
kett. vou stop their offensive.“-

“The key was Bob Junko,” Fazio

said, referring to his defensive coor- ‘

dinator. “He had 14 defensive guys
very disciplined all week.”

Although the debate will rage on
as to how. much of a turning point
victory stands for since Pitt began its
winning streak against Florida
State, Fazio now looks over his
shoulder at this game and smiles

incredulously.

“We told our guys that you came

to Pitt to be on national TV, to play

teams like Notre Dame,”he said, “so _

go out and play your kind of game.”

up the slack,” Wallace said.. “lt’s a
big loss, losing a player as talented as
Dwight, but we couldn’t give up. We
accepted the challenge.”

On the day, Wallace grabbed ﬁve
aerials for a total of 90 yards, includi ’
ing a 44-yard touchdown toss from
first-half quarterback John
Congemi. " ‘

“On that play, Iran a 59-T shoot,”
he said. “It's a fly pattern down the
sideline. When John threw it, I had '
to adjust and cut it. I caught it and
scored."

On the last offensive play of the
first half, starting quarterback Con-

gemi was injured while trying un_suc- \

cessfully to evade the Irish defensive
pursuit.

The second half unveiled fellow
sophomore Chris Jelic. In replacing

Congemi, Jelic iced the game, engi- _ ‘

neering an ll-play, 80-yard touch-
down drive. ' . ~

The big play in the winning touch-
down drive was a third-and-ll from
the Panthers’ 34. Jelic threw 19
yards to a wide open Wallace for a_
colossal first down on the Notre
Dame 47.

“I cut in about I8 yards down
field, and Chris‘ pass was right on,”
Wallace said.

“Chris did a greatjob. It took us a
little time to adjust to him, but he
played very well.”

‘Distant’

, By LAURIE KUBLI

Whoever said that two out of

three is not bad? It may not be bad,
but in some cases, it is just not good

I enough either.

The Pitt-Converse Classic this

weekend wasan example of the Pitt
woman's volleyball team’s inability
to sustain a high level of motivation
throughout an entire tournament.
‘ The spikers’ loss came at the
hands of eventual tournament
winner Cincinnati in between victo-
ries over Big East rival Georgetown
and Western Kentucky, a team that
has two athletes who graduated
from an area school. Two wins in
three tries gave Pitt a second place
finish at the Classic and raised the
team’s record to 27-9.

The Pitt News, Monday, November 7, 1983

Second For Spikers In Tourney

The battles were fought on three
different courts, the first at the Field
House against Georgetown, whom
Pitt defeated earlier this season at
Seton Hall. The Lady Hoyas, under
first-year coach Ken Ng, failed to
challenge the home team in the first
game as Pitt won 15-5.

Pitt surged ahead,'7-0, paced by
Cathy Rupp’s powerful top-spin
serves in the second game. George-
town pulled a quick revival and
pulled ahead, 12-10, but Pitt held off
the Hoya threat-and won the match,
15-12.-

Rupp again played an important
role in the third and deciding game,

as Pitt trounced the visitors, 15-3, to V

take the match. The junior setter
aced ll of Pitt's 17 serves against
Georgetown, a feat Pitt head coach
Shelton Collier called outstanding.

“Our goal was to win convinc-
ingly, and we accomplished that," he
said. “We’re a much better team. I
was pleased‘ that my team has played
well in Big East matches because it's
important that we continue to domi-
nate conference opponents.”

Rupp maintains that her intimi-
dating serve is still in the stages of
development.

“The Georgetown match, like
Tennessee [last weekend], helped to
improve my serve,” she explained.

“I want to learn to be able to con-
trol my serve by mentally relaxing.
It’s slowly progressing. I still have a
lot of work" to do on it because it
didn’t hold up.”

The action moved to Trees Hall
on Saturday morning, a gymnasium
the spikers practice in but one that

would prove to be one they would
not win in.

Cincinnati established itself early,
taking a 10-2 lead and winning the
first game, 15-8. Pitt appeared to be
stuck in the clutches of the morning-
after syndrome, again falling behind
early in the second game, but
regained its form and won, 15-8.

The home team could not sustain
the intensity exhibited against Geor-
getown and lost the third game, 12-
15. Pitt had victory within reach in
the fourth game, but fell short as the
Lady Bearcats won the game and the
match 17-15. *

“What’s disappointing is that
we’ve lost the reputation we worked
extra hard at building,” Collier
remarked. “Pitt has been nationally
respected for playing emotionally

and aggressively every match, not
just two out of three.”
Maintaining a high level ofinten-
sity and getting up for every match is
something every good team must be

otal Domination
Subdues Irishmen

continued from page nine

McCall was the opponent rusher to
eclipse the 100-yard mark with 116.

The first half was marked by sev-
eral second-effort gains on third
down, resulting in big first downs as
McCall displayed the form that
made him‘ the preseason All East

tflﬁcadidate that he was.

With the Panthers-leading 7-0 in
the opening quarter of play, McCall,
who gained 52 yards in the first half,
took two Congemi handouts, and
within 40 seconds, he had added six
to the previous seven. The touch-
down scamper was 10 yards as Mc-
Call broke several potential tackles.

During the second half, when the
Panthers put the Irish away, McCall
was as instrumental as anybody on
the field. _

He -rushed. for 64 yards, including
31 on one effort during the fourth-

Yiquarter scoring drive that put it out

of reach.

The touchdown, a one-yard run
by McCall, was an off-tackle play,
during which he was met at the line
of ‘ scrimmage by Notre Dame
defender Tony Furjanic. McCall
fought off the stiff hit by Furjamic
and burrowed his way into the end
zone.

“I have to hand it to my blockers,”
 McCall said. “My fullbacks and

offensive line played great all day.
Especially the fullbacks.

“Marlon [Mclntyre] and Marc

[Bailey] are the best blocking full-
backs that a tailback could ask for.
Along with the offensive line, they
sprang holes for me all day.

“The offense really came together
as a unit. We played consistently

throughout the game. It was great to-

come here and beat Notre Dame

 ‘here. ”

The defense was led by the out-
standing play of inside linebacker
Troy Benson,‘who snuffed two of
Notre Dame’s three last-ditch efforts
to get into the end zone as he twice
intercepted crucial passes.

The first came with 12:13 remain-
ing in the game, as ND quarterback
Steve Beuerlein, under pressure at
the Pitt seven-yard line, tried throw-
ing for the TD but couldn’t elude the
outstretched arms of Benson.

“It was nothing special,” Benson
said. “I saw him look back inside
and fortunately, I was able to react
and came up with the interception.”

"Following that was a Notre Dame
drive that consisted of another
Beuerlein interception, this oneuby
another Troy Hill. '

Notre Dame head coach Gerry
Faust then elected to bench Beuer-
lein and go with senior Blair Kiel.-

Kiel led the Irish to the Pitt 37-
yard line. '

On second—and-five, Benson
picked off a Kiel pass at the Pitt 27

94 yard line and for all intents and pur-

poses, the game was over.

“This was a great win,” Benson
said. “We played the best game of
our season. We gelled as a team. Not
just the defense, but the entire
team.”

Another defensive star was senior
safety and All-America candidate
Tommy Flynn. Despite holding
Irish tailback‘ Allen Pinkett to 82
yards on 22 carries, therewere sev-
eral occasions when Flynn made
saving tackles. —

Pinkett’s largest gain of the day
went for 21 yards, and it was Flynn
and only Flynn who prevented it
from becoming a six pointer.

It was as if Flynn acted as the
stand-in or safety valve tackler for
the entire defense.

Though instances were spread
throughout the game, if Flynn’s
forever awareness had not been as
abounding as it was, the day could
have been a long one for the Pitt
defense.

Instead, in dragging several Irish
attempts to the dirt, the defense was
given the opportunities to make the
big plays, specifically the turnovers
that kept the Irish at bay. «

“The offense did their job in the

beginning,” Flynn said. “We felt if .

we could put them in the position

‘ aw-here:-they » had -to‘. play catch-up,-.. .-

 

then our defense could do the job.

“This is the sweetest victory that
l’ve been involved in since the ( 1983)
Sugar Bowl. This one means a whole
lot.”

The offensive line, as McCall
alluded, was without adoubt as vital
a part of the victory as any.

For senior center Jim Sweeney,
though, the victory had that extra
special effect.

“You play like you practice, and
_we worked very hard for this one all
week,” he said. “It pays off. The
mostsatisfying thing about the win
for us, though, is that we beat the
odds. We pulled off the upset, and
especially after last year’s disap-

- pointment.. Being an Irishman and

beating Notre Dame is a great feel-
ing — it’s just hard to describe.”

The offensive line, despite the
minus 64 yards compiled between
the two quarterbacks (Jelic and
Congemi), opened the ND defense
for 224 yards by the Panther
runners. '

“We were really excited about

playing Notre Dame,” sophomore
quard Mike Dorundo said. “We
were really prepared for this game.
It's the most satisfying win for me
since the Sugar Bowl, and this one
obviously means a lot more because
I played in this one.”

In the eyes of Bill Fralic, the out-
pm was also quite rewarding.

“We’ve been on the verge of blow-
ing people out all season," he said.
“This game was somewhat like the
Florida State game. Everybody
played well, and we came together
the way we knew we could.

“When Chris [Jelic] came in the
second half we couldn’t help but feel
confident. He showed great confi-
dence; It was—a good win." — »

#1!!!

And finally, Chris Jelic, following
in the footsteps of fellow sophomore
John Congemi, played with poise
that separates the mediocre teams
from the good ones.

The fourth-quarter, ll-play, 80-
yard drive was evidence enough that
Congemi could take as much time as
he needed to heal himself.

“At first, the offense had to get
used to me,” he said. “It’s great to
have the chance to play in these con-
ditions, with the game on the line,
and come through for the team.

“Everybody rose to the occasion.
The offensive line was blowing them
off the line, and the defense played
great. I’m just happy to get in and
contribute, especially when the
game is on the line.”

“It takes a long time to build a

“but our inconsistent efforts this
year have cost us a reputation which,
to me, was very valuable. Our imme-
diate goal is to now focus on prepar-
ing for Penn State.”

an incentive. The match against
Eastern Kentucky had a homecom-

quartet was honored, with their par-
ents, before the match.

Wexell aced five serves and

slammed seven spikes onto the ‘Lady 

Colonels’ court in the match.

“Kris played her best front court
match of the year,” said Collier.
Wexell had 14 kill shots for the
weekend.

“It was a great match for our team
due to the exposure of playing in the
state's volleyball community. There
were many potential recruits and
parents in the stands,” said Collier.

Eastern Kentucky struck first, as
it would do in every game that night,
but Pitt struck harder. Leading 5-1,

Pitt went on a skid and fell behind as .

the visitors scored 10 unanswered~i‘$‘

points, leading ll-5. The Panthers
took over the reins in allowing EKU
only one more point before Pitt put

The Lady Colonels charged into
the second game and burned the
home team for nine points before
Pitt managed to light the score-
board. Down 3-10, Pitt once more
bounced back to take a 14-11 lead,
but the game point proved to be as
elusive as the first point. EKU tied
the score at 14-14, before Pitt
snatched the victory away 16-14.

doesn’t believe the loss to Cincinnati
will affect her team’s performance
against Penn State next weekend.

“I hope we can get everything to

Setter Rupp, who had 20 kill shots
in the tournament, agrees with
Kohutiak, a player to whom she sets.

said. “Psychologically, -we should

By MARGARITA ELLEN

It was a fitting way to end the
season at home: The Pitt soccer
team upset Division I l5th-

. ranked Akron 1-0 last Wednes-
day night.

And it came as no surprise
when the winning edge was sup-
plied by two freshmen: Dave Van
Newkirk, who scored the second-
half goal, and Rich Godfrey,
who assisted on the winning
shot.

Godfrey, from Fallston, Md.,
is no stranger around the goal-
mouth. He is currently tied for
the team scoring lead with
another freshman, Bob Howard,
both having scored six goals in
their initial season with the
Panthers.

Godfrey’s third assist of the
season against Akron aided the
young booters in concluding
coach Leo Bemis’ career at the
Pitt helm with a home victory.

“We knew the Akron game
was important,” said Godfrey.
“It was the last home game for
coach, and we wanted him to go
out with a win. We also knew we
had to win to go to the Big East
Tournament.”

If the Panthers gain a berth in
the Big East Final Four, Godfrey
just might find himself playing
against a former Fallston High
School teammate who now plays
on the Connecticut squad.

Godfrey had a successful high
school career, averaging 15 goals
per season and also being named
All-County for three consecutive
years. In his ‘senior year, Godfrey
was named All-Metro and
helped lead his team to the Mary-
land state soccer finals.

Fallston suffered a heart-
breaking 3-2 loss in overtime, but
it gave Bemis his first good look
at this young Panther.

“When I saw Rich, I knew he
had the potential to be a good
player for the Pitt program,”
Bemis said. “We’re very happy
that Rich elected to come with
us. I recruited scoring people for
this year, and Rich is one of
them.”

Godfrey plays in the middle of
the scoring surge at the center-
forward position. He was
switched early in the season from
the right wing slot, where he
played in high school. if ‘

“My power is in my right
foot,” Godfrey said, “Coach

thought I worked better in the
middle. I find my speed to be my
biggest advantage right now. In
college soccer, you have to be a
lot faster and stronger.

“You’re up against more expe-

rienced juniors and seniors WI10!

are equal or better. I want to
work on getting bigger and fast-
er. You get knocked around by
bigger fullbacks, and" I don’t like
that too much.”

Godfrey is no small fry himself
at 5-11 and 160 lbs. He’s from a
new breed of scorers who are
bigger, to take on the tougher
defensemen, yet quick, to work
the ball into the net.

“Most of our scoring has been
done by the young players,”
Bemis said. “We didn’t get any
Parade All-Americas, but we got
some very good soccer players. If
they work at it, they will make

the Pitt program very successful

in the future,”

His mother a native of Czech-
oslovakia, Godfrey got his intro-
duction into soccer from his
older brother, Joseph, who'was
an avid soccer player in Eastern
Europe. Joseph passed on his

skill and love for the sport to-

Rich.

“Joseph introduced me to the
game,” Godfrey explained. “He
got _me started, but my dad has
been the most inﬂuential. He
kept pushing me to do my best.
He never missed any of my
soccer games, until one game this
season. He’s always there and
has ‘been by main support.”

And Godfrey has been one of
the Panthers’ main supports in
their scoring attack. With a big
victory over Akron under their
belt, the Panthers look forward
to a conference showdown
against undefeated IUP today
and a possible trip to the Big East
Tournament on Nov. ll-13 at’
Connecticut.

“Against Akron, we showed
how'good we can play and that
we have potential to be a great
team,” Godfrey said. “I like
soccer because it’s exciting to
play. The game against Akron
was one of the most exciting
games I've been a part of. -

“We have to keep up that
intensity. We have to go in think-
ing we can win, thinking we can
beat the big teams and keep on
thinking that all the time. We
have to stick together, and we
can win, the Big East

}

"Only A Freshman, Godfrey Already On Scoring Binge

Tournament.”

This enthusiastic newcomer
has set high goals for himself
over the next few years, as well as
team goals that the believes this
Pitt squad can accomplish.

“Right now, I have one goal '

for myself,” Godfrey said. ‘‘I’m
striving to break the career goal
record, but that’s a long way off.
In the meantime, I want to con-
tribute to the team and win some
more games.

“We can win more games in
the coming seasons.‘ We’re a
young team, and we’re getting to
know one another better, so we
can work together better on the
field. This season isn't over yet.
Everyone on the team is looking
forward to a possible trip to the
Big East Tournament. IUP is
undefeated, and I’d like to see us
knock them of -.”

Until the Final Four are
announced, Godfrey and the rest
of the Pitt soccer team have a
warning for their opponents.

“No one has noticed it, but we
have a good team,” Godfrey said.
“Tell all the soccer teams around
to beware: we're good, and we’re
going to be even better in the
future.”

Revenge In Hand, Panthers HitTurning Point

By MARK A. SINDLER

SOUTH BEND, Ind. — Observa-
tions from a‘ campus where all
thoughts on Saturday turn to foot-
ball and nothing else:

0 Almost on .cue, a moan arose
from the Pitt Stadium crowd last
week when ﬂanker Dwight Collins
suffered a severely sprained ankle;

Pitt would be without a deep threat

in passing situations.

As it was, he didn’t mind, but no
one consulted split end Bill Wallace.
The underrated 6-2, l90'-lb. junior
made sure that no one missed Col-
lins, leading both teams in receiving
yardage with 90.

“Sometimes I do see myself as
underrated,” Wallace said, “I think
there have been three or four catches
the last couple games the refs called
no good or out of bounds. It proba-
bly has to do with this being my first
year.”

The patience has paid off for Wal-
lace, who has been more accustomed
to keeping former split end Julius
Dawkins’ seat on the bench warm.
Now Wallace leads the team in
receiving yards with 423, and with 24
receptions, he trails Collins by one.

if 0 Almost lost in the jubilance
created by the 21-16 victory was any

trace of a revenge factor. Last sea-

son, almost to the day, Notre Dame
shattered the Panthers’ national title
hopes in a 31-16 shellshocker.

“I'll tell you in five years what this
game meant," tackle Bill Fralic said.
“This is our first big game since Flor-
ida State. We had to .go up against
Notre Dame’s tradition, their five-
game winning streak and no one
expected us to win. I'm not really
concerned about revenge.”

“Revenge was no major motiva-
tion,” center Jim Sweeney said. “For
those who played last year, though,
a national championship was taken
away, and it tells you something
when you beat the epitome of college
football — Notre Dame.

“I just look at [the win] as a step-
ping stone for us," Pitt stong safety
Ray Weatherspoon said. “We‘ve
been through some bad games and
just couldn't come together. Every-
thing fell into place today."

“People talk of tradition,” defen-
sive end Chris Doleman said. “They
talk about how they could walk all
over us. But nobody ever talks about
our tradition — defense."

“It feels real good," tailback Joe
McCall said of the final score. “You
can't describe it. This is the turning
point of our year. Beating [Notre
Dame] and their tradition — there

are no words to explain it.”

0 Cornerback Troy Hill on Pitt’s
renaissance midway through the
season: “This win gives us a whole
different outlook on the season. The
bowl committees watched us play
and we showed them that they
should give us another chance.
They're not casting us out yet.”

Our bowl picture looks real
good,” Wallace said. “We wanted
this win so bad. Revenge was it.
They beat us bad last year.”

0 Pitt head coach Foge Fazio on
his counterpart on Saturday, Notre
Dame’s GerryvFaust: “He is what
college football is all about.”

0 Speculation abounds now over
Pitt’s possible bowl bid. The Sugar is
a possibility against Auburn, but the
reps there will have to decide if they
want a record or a team. Boston Col-
lege (8-l) has the record, but Pitt has
the established name. ,

Two straight losses by North
Carolina (by Maryland, 28-26 and
by Clemson 16-3 two days ago) has
removed it from the Sugar picture.

A good draw might pit the Panth-

ers against Nebraska in the Orange A

Bowl. After squeaking past East
Carolina I2-7 over the weekend and
still having to play a resurgent Flor-
ida State squad, Miami is not a
shoo-in for the Orange.

If Pitt accepts a bid to the Fiesta, a
realistic opponent could be Georgia,
coming on strong as of late in the
Southeast Conference,

A lot could still be riding on how _

decisively Pitt defeats its remainig
two opponents: Army and Penn
State. And a win over the Nittany
Lions is not yet a commandment
from upstairs.

0 Faust on why he stuck with
freshman quarterback Steve Beuer-
lein after his dismal first-half perfor-
mance: “Steve played fine except for
the interceptions. You'll see that in
freshmen. One that was out there in
the beginning was a receiver’s fault.
[Tight end Mark Bavaro] thought it
was a blitz and changed his course.”

That was Beuerlein’s first inter-
ception, “hitting Tom Flynn on the
numbers at Pitts 29."

0 After quarterback John Con-
gemi hit Wallace for Pitt’s first
score, Faust ran onto the field rant-
ing over what he thought was offen-
sive pass interference. A. l5-yard
unsportsmanlike conduct penalty
was assessed on the ensuing kickoff.

“I thought it was interference,”.he

said. “I was talking to the back.

[judge] guy [Michael Donato], he
was right behind the play. I was
arguing with him, but I didn’t know
I was on the field.

“But you have to go with the offi-
cials, they're calling the game.”

[0 People thought that everyone in
this corner of the world abided by
the highest of standards in etiquette.
Think twice. '

A sign in the press box desperately
needs to be posted — outlawing
cheering by what is now a very parti-
san media corps covering Notre

Dame football. The way these “jour5-if-5

nalists” were cheering one would
think they were lost without their
pompons. . _
