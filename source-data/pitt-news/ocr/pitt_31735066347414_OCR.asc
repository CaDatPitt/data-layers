New Review Urged For Nyden

BY MREA CSORBA

The faculty grievance commit-
tee reviewing the alleged political
ﬁring of assistant sociology profes-
sor Paul Nyden, recommended
another committee review the case
in its report released last Thursday.

The report issued by the
ﬁve-member grievance committee
from the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences (FAS) Tenure and Promo-
tions Hearing Board suggested an
ad hoc University committee be

‘formed to evaluate Nyden’s _
scholarly performance during his

three-year contract with Pitt.

“While/ this committee (the
grievance committee) is instructed
to ascertain the existence- of the
“stated cause” (for the _termina-
tion), it is generally understood that
substantive questions of’ scholar.-
ship are beyond its competence,”,
the report states. ' _

The committee has been inter-
viewing key persons involved in the
case since October.

The report speciﬁed while the

new committee’s members should 7

have competence in the ﬁeld of
sociology, members should not be
from the department involved, nor
should they have publicly commit-
ted themselves on any aspect of the
Nyden case.

'The report advised placing its _

greatest emphasis on _Nyden’s
dissertation, both on'the original
draft, which drew lavish praise from
the Columbia University disserta-

-tion committee, and its revised

draft, which Nyden had worked on
during his contract here.

His other work, “Sociology for
the Oppressed,” the report sug-
gests, should be assigned a
secondary importance to Nyden’s

overall performance, because

BY MARK CELENDER

Pitt’s image is one of the many
reasons for the,University's low
black enrollment, according to Vice
Chancellor for Student Affairs
Alfred Moye.

"We're ﬁghting images that
have been around since the early
sixties," Moye said. “It's hard to
recruit black high school graduates
to Pitt because Pitt has a ‘white
university‘ image and because

Pittburgh has an unattractive -
T smokey little town image," he said.

tional Programs (U-CEP). who

Nyden seemed to view that work
“with little more signiﬁcance than
as a favor he did at the request of his
mentor, Dr’. Paul Lazarsfeld.”
Both parties involved in the
grievance charge received the
finished report. with enthusiasm.

"The sociology department hailed

the report as the ﬁnal justiﬁcation
for last April's 14-1-1 vote not to
renew Nyden’s contract. Nyden
also interpreted the committee's
evaluation as favorable to his case.
Nyden criticized the committee
for not objecting to the depart-
ment’ s judgment of him soley ‘on the
basis of scholarship, without
consideration of his teaching and
community input. But Nyden said,
“I regard the report as quite‘
favorable to me, given that the
procedures leaned heavily towards

the administration and against me. .

“I’m surprised the report con-
ﬁrms a number of statements I have
been making all along,” Nyden

Disabledstudeniseet Guide

BY PAUL MATHEWS

A published aid for Pitt's
disabled students, faculty and staff
was released yesterday by the
University’s Ofﬁce_ of Veteran
Affairs. '

An external access guidebook
listing‘ Pitt's ‘accessible’ buildings
and the optimum routes between
them is now available to all
members of the University com-
munity and prospective, Pitt stu-
dents conﬁned to wheelchairs.

Jack Hayes, director of Pitt’s

A Pitt's Image Is Cause  

students on a predominantly white
campus is alienation.

“All the usual problems _ of
adjusting to college are heightened
if you're a minority student, simply
because being black is different,"
Reed said. . «

Moye said due to pressure from
the government, universities want
a high minority percentage in their
student body and they want a good
quality student.

"The competition for minority
students from other institutions
throughout the country is tough,"
Moye said. “Universities will
recruit from just about anywhere to
increase their percentage of minor-
ity students."

According

to a fact "book

PAUL NYDEN .
Moore_ photo .

Ofﬁce of Veteran Affairs, said the
guidebook, Access, was designed
to meet the needs of disabled
students on campus.

“This. publication is a graphic
representation of optimum exterior
‘routes throughout campus and a
narrative description of accessible
building entrances.” Hayes said.

The booklet also contains infor-
mation about curbcuts. ramps,
grades of more than ﬁve degrees,
the types" of classes taught in Pitt's
buildings, emergency telephones
and specially designated parking
places for vehicles with Pennsyl-
vania ‘HP’ license plates,-Access
Project manager and designer Jeff
Parker said. '

Parker said that before Access
was published, wheelchair stu-
dents passed on information about
accessible buildings and the best
routes between them by word of
mouth. “Now students havea
handy reference which will immed-
iately give them critical access
information as well as optimum and
alternate routes," he said.

Tom Galante. University advisor
for disabled students, said access is
a problem that can best be solved
by providing students with mobility
constraints with as much informa-
tion as possible to help them get
around campus with conﬁdence.

“This booklet will hopefully
eliminate many of the effects
caused by access problems on
campus," Galante said.

The guidebook deﬁnes access as
"the right to enter or make use of a
facility. Several _ factors are
necessary to insure that wheelchair

Athletic Facilities Open

Despite Pitt Shutdown

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

Despite the University-wide
shutdown that directed all student
activities cease. Fitzgerald Field
House and Trees Hall remained
open over the weekend to

_accommodate a track meet and
several varsity athletic practices.
Executive Assistant .to the
Chancellor Ed Bozik said yesterday
tliat the University was closed in
order to comply with the governor's
order‘ ta‘ close down non-essentials.

The track meet, the '8th Annual
Pitt indoor Track Invitational,
scheduled for Friday and Saturday,
was held '_-because most of the
visiting teams were already in
Pittsburgh, according to assistant
sports information director Vince
Ditlardo. AthleticDirector Casimir

Myslinski reported that although,

the teams ran, the meet was
“unofﬁcial ."

serve a number of purposes other
than as a user’s guide for getting
around the campus.

“I hope this will be used as a
consciousness-raising tool to get
people in Pitt’s buildings to
scrutinize their. space and adjust it
to the needs of disabled students,”
he said.

Hayes said he also hoped the
guidebook would raise . the con-
sciousness of Pitt's able-bodied
students to recognize the problems
disabled students encounter on
campus. ‘and be used by city
planners and architects for future
reference in designing and remod-
eling Pitt’s b 'ld'ngs.

Bozik said he had no knowledge,
the track meet was held this
weekend. 

Although the Field House and
Trees Hall were closed to students,
intramural‘ department .1 head Leo
Bemis said the women's basketball

team and the swim team practiced‘ ' ‘

in the buildings on Monday.

‘,‘lf a coach wanted to hold at ‘

practice I guess they were given
the go-ahead," Bemis said. .

As long as they complied with
the heatingwegulations, coaches
were allowed to have practices.
Myslinski said yesterday.

Acting Director of News and
Publications Mary Ann Aug said
yesterday the Chancellor had
ordered all University buildings to
close. although the track meet was
approved. “it was our understand-
ing that the buildings would be
closed after the track meet," she
said.

 ~-Temperatures in all University

buildings were cut back over the
weekend to approximately 60 to 62

,degrees, and will remain that way

throughout this week, Plant Ser-
vices and building maintenance
director Alex Kaminsky said.
“The athletic facilities were told
they would have to function under
cut-back heat," Kaminsky said.
Bozik saiddyesterday the decision a

to have practices for varsity athletic , ’

teams was voluntary on the part of
the coaches.

“It has to do with personnel,"
Bozik said. “We didn't have any
volunteers to staff the library," he
said. referring to the fact the
athletic facilities’ were open for
athletic practices while the library
remained closed over the weekend. a

Bozik added the University asked
all non-essential personnel to
remain home over the weekend._

Natural Gas Pipe Excavated NYCl9"GrieV°“C9 B°°'°l .-

_ BY MREA CSORBA

A six-foot part of the structurally
damaged gas line near Langley
Hall was excavated yesterday for
metallurgical testing to determine
if the break in the line caused the
Langley Hall explosion, or if the
explosion caused the rupture.

Preliminary investigations into
the Jan. 20 blast which killed two
women and injured 68 others points
to a natural gas‘ explosion as the
plausible cause, Superintendent of
City Policy Robert Coll said at a
January 24th press conference.

Coll said the ruptured four-inch
main was an old supply line no
longer in use, although recent
information indicates this informa-

, .4 _ tion is incorrect.

. “This line is part of the pipe

system supplying the area,” Ray‘

Testa, coordinator of Equitable Gas
Company's investigation said at
the dig yesterday. Testa had been
one of two Equitable Gas represen-
tatives barred from the meeting
that convened here at Pitt last week
prior to the news conference.

The meeting, organized by
County Coroner Cyril Wecht,
included 22 city, state and
University representatives investi-
gating the blast.

Equitable Gas, who owns the
ruptured line presently under
scrutiny, sent two representatives
to the meeting. “The coroner
issued the invitations to the
meeting. We were not invited and
so were not allowed in,” Testa

said.

Wecht said because Equitable
Gas was not (Yne of the official
agencies investigating the blast,
they were not issued an invitation.
“lt was the feeling of the people at
the University and myself that
because we were investigating the
causes for the blast, it would serve
the interest of the case not to have
a vested interest, like the gas
Company, as a party to the
investigation."

Wecht said that judgment did
not preclude the Equitable Gas line
was the source of the blast.

The six-food piece of the main
located along the sidewalk 120 feet
from Langley Hall and dug up
yesterday was "wrapped in green
line tape and boxed to insure safe
shipment to the Metallurgical

~Consultants Corporation in Hous-
ton. Texas, where‘ the testingwill
be done. Testa said he did not
know when the results of the tests
will be released.

 

   
   

Suggests New Review

(Continued from Page 1)

Acting chairman of the sociology
department Vijai P. Singh excerp-
ted sections of the report into his
written statement, which states
evidence presented by the panel of
interviewees suggests legitimate
grounds for criticizing the quality of.
Nyden’s scholarly research.

Though the committee contends
it is not a competent body to judge
Nyden’s scholarly performance,
Singh wrote in his report, “Since
the fact of Dr. Nyden’s deﬁcient
sociological scholarship has been
established by the Hearing Board,
its recommendation for the ap-
pointment of a new committee to
investigate Dr. Nyden’s sociological
scholarship must be rejected.”

FAS Dean Jerome Rosenber

he will decide whether to convene

Priority Snow Job

Once again the priorities of the University of Pittsburgh come under
ﬁre—this time for allowing Trees Hall and the Fitzgerald Field House to
remain open for a track invitational and scheduled athletic practices
while closing Hillman Libaty and buildings that house student activities.

The cold wave that hit Western Pennsylvania created an energy crisis
severe enough to warrant the canceling of classes and a visit to the area
by President Carter. Yet neither rain, snow, sleet, nor gloom of night

' could interfere with the almighty athletic depa.rtment’s plans.

If the administration felt no guilt toward holding the events as
-scheduled, then why did it request a news blackout of the track
invitational? Was this an attempt to pull a snow job on area residents?

Gas Crisis-Think;

BY GARY GOVERT

As I write this. thousands of,
workers have been laid off their
jobs: factory managers say they
can't get enough natural gas to

keep production at full-
employment levels. Gov. Shapp
has’ declared a natural gas

emergency. ordered schools closed
and asked everyone to turn down
the thermostats. Pipeline pressure
threatens to drop, like the
temperature already has.

I was in the Middle East during
the winter, of discontent three years
past. so I have no memory of night-
marish lines at the gasoline pumps.
But. since returning to the U.S. the
following summer, I have been
thoroughly schooled in the alleged
shortage's economic impact. The
ﬁxed digits on the petrol dispen-
sers are forcible reminders of what
the Arabs or the oil companies
(choose one) have done to us——or
what we've done to ourselves.

In view ofthe state of excitement
now prevailing. I can’t help but
wonder if we're in for a repeat of
the so-called oil crisis. Will prices
be doubled and conservation
efforts remain nil. as happened
subsequent to the 1974 “emer-
gency?”

Depending on the source. the oil
shortage in 1973-74 was either real
or it was not. Certain groups claim
Big Oil used the Arab embargo as a
cover for putting the squeeze on
consumers. The oil companies
deny it. and have since spent huge
sums on “image" advertising-
they would have us believe in
them. trust them.

Now the same sort of charges

I and denials aregrowing out of the

natural gas issue. The gas
companies. many of them intim-
ately related to the oil producers.
would like nothing better than
deregulation of prices. Are they
inventing a shortage. giving us a
little taste of the cold. in order to
get what they want? Or are the gas

I   On Contributingto Society  

I "thought" it was. Third. I think
of the present and future and I set
an _example as to how I think
society should function. It's on me.

THE VISION

I see positive with my mind. I
tell myself people. not institutions.
can make a better society.
requirements for this positive
vision include—little everyday
people like you and me believing it
so. and acting. and behaving as if
we want a humane society. There
are a lot of ripples of human power
in speaking to the local policeman
on the beat. making peace with
“that" difﬁcult person in your
department. or reaching out and
showing your deck of cards. Most

of us can make this vision a reality _

by simply saying. “damn it—I too
am responsible. accountable and a
part of this system." It's not
enough to look to a leader. boss or
savior for societal solutions. .As a
teacher in Berkeley once told me,
become the model yourself. One
person can make a difference.
Your vision and behavior is just

as important as mine. People only I

see. hear. and feel other people.
They never feel. touch or see
something ‘out there.’ In short. we
get our impressions about America
from those local. simple‘. ever_vd-a_v
contacts. If our vision is positive it

negative expect similar vibrations.

It would be. of course, unfair to

bankrupt gas companies with
unjust price structures. but at the

the ethics behind threatening
llghtless and heatless homes unless
"monetary incentives are increased. -
Such pressure tactics smack of a
rather narrow and conditional view
of responsibility. Should, the
maintenance of essential services
be totally-—or even primarily-
dependent upon allowing produ-
cers to realize maximum proﬁt?

Why does the Washington Post's

So it's hard_not to be skeptical
about this winter's big pinch. But
perhaps the natural gas “emer-
gency" will be good for us. ‘if it
doesn't further entrench the
narrow view of responsibility
currently embraced by most
corporations. If we learn to set our
thermostats a little lower. if this
winter reminds us of the difference
between necessities and luxuries, if
we are somehow prodded into
stepping up the search for
alternatives Ito non-renewable
energy sources—tlien we'll be
better off for having felt the pinch.

Amidst _all these crises. we must
sooner or later learn that the key to
“solving the energy puzzle” is not
corporate technique or technology.
The “laws" ‘of laissez-faire
economics do not contain the
answer. Token efforts at conserva-

Only when we_—individ,ually and
corporately—acknowledge that the

Admission Indiscretion

Applicants to the School of
Medicine of the University of
Pittsburgh should consider the
following facts:

1. Of the nearly 3,500 applica-
tions to the medical school, only 20
percent have been reviewed
completely by the Admissions
Committee.

2. There are only 136 seats in next
year’s freshman class of medical
students and yet more than 100
applicants have already been
accepted to fill these positions.

3. No one is accepted to the
School of Medicine without an
interview. I _

4. Dr. Posvar, the Chancellor of
the University, and the School of
Medicine encourage and practice a
policy of special consideration for
the children of friends and
benefactors of the University of
Pittsburgh and guarantees them
acceptance interviews, the majority
of . which are provided before

December when there are many
seats available in the medical
school.
5. Thus, the situation is that
’ nearly 2,800 applicants whose
parents are not fortunate to be
considered friends of the Chancellor
or the University and who did not
i receive courtesy interviews are now
competing for 36 positions in the
School of Medicine of a University
that receives substantial ﬁnancial
support from the taxpayers of
Pennsylvania. ‘ '
Should not all of our children be
provided the same opportunity to
compete for all of the 136 positions
in the School of Medicine of the
University of Pittsburgh? The
concept of courtesy has no place in
the admissions process of our
professional schools.

Apartheid Opposition

In 1961, 67 blacks were killed by

.South Africa’s white minority

regime in an outburst of racist
oppression. Within thelast few
months South Africa’s government
has killed at least six times as many
blacks as died at Sharpsville.
Moral opposition to apartheid—a
system that forces blacks to be
virtual slaves in their own
countries——already has the support
of most people throughout the
world, including the United States.

It is expected that international
protests, will be organized in
Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean
around that time against apartheid
and racism in southern Africa. Here
in the United States, the National
Student Coalition Against Racism

_called ‘for two days of national
protests against U.S. complicity
with racist regimes in South Africa,
Zimbabwe and Namibia. The dates
they have proposed are March 25
and 26.

southern Africa for freedom! and ~
equality. Being in the homeland of

Is Gaining Momentum

the white minority regimes’ most
powerful backers, we can play an
important role in helping bring
together a powerful movement to
oppose U.S. political, economic,
and military ties to those regimes. _

We are calling upon students,
trade unionists, activists in the
women’s movement, blacks, native
Americans, religious people, and all
others to join together in such a
movement. The organization of
broad community-wide coalitions is
taking place throughout the United
States today, from Los Angeles to
New York. ‘

Only by building such a united
movement will it be possible to
exert maximum pressure on the
American government to end its ties
to apartheid and the white minority
regimes. A massive movement for
black majority rule NOW and
against Washington’s racist Africa
policies is the most effective way to
support the struggles of our
brothers and sisters in southern
Africa.

it a point to motivate them to make

Another thing I do is simply begin.
I emphasize by example not to

reference make a significant
contribution.

BY EXAMPLE

This is my most important
point. We've been trained to
expect package foolproof answers
and quick. But suppose you cannot
ﬁnd the answers; suppose your
source is not coming through?
Who knows for sure there are nine
planets?

I've ﬁnally begun to handle this
matter too. I search for my own

answers. I set an example by doing .

have to wait-for your Congressman,

cannot “give" it to you. Better yet.

have liked. to see it in others. Then
you accomplish three things: you
have set an example irrespective of
past precedents for those above
and below you. You may be the
only bible that some people will
ever see. Second. you have made a
priceless contribution to society
that does not fluctuate with the
market. ' Third, you are living while
there's still time; you are doing
something constructive to make our
society a more humane place for
mankind. I
There can only be incremental
change anyway because 80 percent
of the budget is earmarked and the
other 20 percent can only be split so
many ways. The real difference is
within you and your work place.

BY MICHELE ROTHERT

“It’s a better location except
for this,"- Greg Eide says
dejectedly.

The medium-built man teeters
on the sill of his store’s front
window. Twenty-ﬁve, thoughtful,
bearded with glasses, he ﬁngers a
cardboard Superman that had been
taped to the glass on opening day
but later marred by steam.

Here's what happened. In late
November, Greg Eide packed his
comic books in boxes and hauled
them from his small, crowded Etna
shop to a new North Side location.
“Congratulations on your new
Comix Shop. Best Wishes,” stated
a good-luck telegram sent by
friends. ‘

The comic book collector was.
eager for business; but, not long
after Eide’s Comix Shop opened,
sub-zero weather caused pipes
beneath the Federal Street building
to freeze and burst. Consequently,
Greg’s new store was flooded with
water, and his posters, books and

records were shriveled by steam. -

“Wonder Woman made it,”
Greg now says, referring to another
window decoration. “But we'll
have to do surgery on Superman."
He jumps to the floor, takes three

 

steps to the counter and rubs
Superman's wrinkled chest with his
ﬁst.

Inside the protective counter, a
colorful assortment of comics is
displayed; however, water-curled
pages blotted red-purple-blue lie
damp and limp on top of the case.
Others, wrapped in plastic, are
shelved behind Greg’s back so
that, from all directions, titles
ﬂash: Shock Suspense Stories,
Crime Stories, Dick Tracy, Mystery

It:

Marvel Mystery, Monsters...
Greg is not alone. Tim Kupin,
his employee,’ leans against the
counter, ironing the soggy comic
books. p
“Some iron out. Most don’t,"
Greg says, solemnly watching Tim.
“I have a Marvel ,Mystery worth
three to four hundred dollars,”
Greg says. “But only ten out of
several hundred thousand comic
books are the high value ones——like
the ﬁrstp issues of Superman or
Captain Marvel. They came out in

Bleier the Businessman

BY RICK STOUFFER

Something was deﬁnitely a-
miss. : I
Here he was—Robert_‘ Patrick
Bleier, football player extraordi-
naire, the man who rushed for more

than 1,000 yards with the ﬁfth

highest average per carry in the
National Football League in 1976.
The jock who, along with teammate
Franco Harris, became‘ the second
backﬁeld in‘ pro history to rush for
more than 1,000 apiece.

Here he was, a pro who should be
out tackling dummies, or scrimmag-
ing. And he was sitting behind a, a
...a desk, and» enjoying’ it. The
Gipper would turn over in his grave.

‘ ‘We’re basically an investment
banking ﬁrm,” said “The Rock” as
he puffed on his Art Rooney
trademark.

“Our ﬁrm is primarily interested
in bond ﬁnancing. What we do,
basically, is use bonds wherever
possible to build things like
shopping centers and sewage
projects.”

The ‘phone rings and Bleier is off
talking about $4 million worth of
sewers in Johnstown with a tone of
authority much like that of his
playing style for the Pittsburgh

Steelers; authoritatively sticking
helmets in linebackers’ guts.

But then, everything about
Bleier is authoritative, from the
curtainless windows to the simple
bookshelf stacked with Mad maga-

~ zines and Pennsylvania Law books.

No frills, nothing fancy. Basic-like-
football business.

“My job for the past year has
been to act like a bird dog,” says
Bleier, as he re-lights the cigar.

‘ ‘I'm the man who is sent out into
the ﬁeld to find new deal-. for the
company. Of course, being
well-known is a deﬁnite asset. It
lets me get my foot in the-door a lot

. of times...a guy might want to talk

football. But when it comes down to
the bottom line and a lot is at stake, I
still have to know what I'm talking
about.”

And Bleier does know what he’s

"(talking about. The man rattles off

industrial bonds, revenue and
underwriters like it's 33 crossbuck
or power sweep right on hike.

But it wasn't always so.
Following graduation. from Notre
Dame in 1968, Rocky (his father
gave him the name when he was
small, because he was “like a
rock”) Bleier looked forward to a
career with the Steelers. Unfortu-

nately, the Army (not the cadet
college, but the real Army), had his
original draft rights and grabbed
him, without a bonus or new car, in
late 1968.

The following May, Vietnam
became his playing ﬁeld.;.but he
didn't stay long. Extensive
shrapnel wounds landed him in the
hospital, and doctors said he would
never play ball again.

Nobody told that to Bleier. He not
only came bacloto the states to play
football, but he did it eight seasons,
getting better each year. Then
came the desk.

“Both myself and my bosses
came into this job knowing it might
not work out. We both had the
option to get out of the deal after
about a year. But really it has
turned out better than either of us

expected. I'm learning the business

and things are working well. It even
ﬁts in to my schedule during the
season.”

After a tough day on the ﬁeld, a
football player relaxing by talking
about a new shopping center to a
group of wary citizens? Nothing
uncommon with Bleier.

“My wife and I aren't really big

the late '30s-early '40s. Now. the
demand for Marvel exceeds what I
can get."

“People bring in comic books or
call me up," he continues. "Flea
Markets are dried up. People have
an assortment of beat-to-hell
books. and they think they have a
fortune because of the publicity
about comic books."

Greg stretches Superman across
the counter. Tim guides the iron
along the dark blue arm, rounds
the shoulder, and presses the

puckered cabad hest.
“I started collecting comic books

before I was eight. but I gaveit up ‘

when I was thirteen," Greg
reflects. “I thought I had outgrown
them. The other part of the reason
was that Superman, Wonder
Woman and Batman were declin-
ing. to a degree, in popularity.”
The remaining albums of Jim
Spitznagel's record supply are
arranged in stands at the rear of
the store. The record collector is
temporarily working with Greg.

“Cash or Trade! For your LP’s or

45's with picture sleeves!" is his
handwritten sign, mounted above
racks of Beatle records.

“I lost a few Monty Python
books." .Iim says. “Luckily the
distributors took back those records
that got wet."

“Seven years ago,'when I was
working in a record store." Greg
adds.. “a friend was reading some
comic books. and I got interested
again. Then I became the
instigator and founder of the
Pittsburgh Comix Club, a club to
get other collectors together.

We held a convention last year at
Duquesne University. We had
movies and workshops, and George
Romaro (producer of the movie
Night of the Living Dead) was
there. Two and three years back.
we were at Pitt's Student Union,
where, in 1974, Stan Lee came to
our convention." '

Greg steps to the window and
crawls onto the sill once more.
Then he places Superman against
the glass for passers-by to see.

“Is Superman straight?" Greg
asks. But. without waiting for an
answer, he jumps down. Greg is
not satisﬁed. He returns to the
counter. where Tim silently irons

“I signed up for it,” the tall,
skinny student said. “I don’t even
know what it is."

The athlete was in the office of
intramural coordinators Lou Fabian

the 200 students who signed up for a
new intramural sport-co-recrea-
tional inner tube water polo.

The skinny one (his friends call
him Slats) wondered why a more

co-recreational water sport to Pitt.

Fabian said the coordinators
surveyed the activity programs of
100 universities. Five schools were

give it a try.

“The turnout was phenomenal,”
Fabian said.

Slats forgot to ask if it was likely

Studio's T he Trial’:
Their Day In Court

BY LEN ROMBERG

Franz Kaﬂ(a’s Josef K. was not
the only one in court this past week.
The Studio Theatre put themselves
on the line with their prdduction of
“The Trial,” a monumentally
different play.

Several pieces of evidence should
be presented before reviewing this
The play has been
translated from Germanjto English,
which immediately distorts the
script before any producer or
director can lay his hands on it.

Michael Burke hand-carved his
adaptation especially for the Studio

Theatre. Finally, the black box
playhouse attempted a bold project
in presenting its version of “The

Keith A. Hoovler portrayed Josef

From that moment, Hoovler plays

Crying Out AtLab Theatre   iComedyAnd Beauty
In ’Bartered Bride’

BY ALEX LEVIN

“I wish I could sit them down
and give them a cup of tea or
S0mf-‘thing. ' ' my theater companion
kept saying. “Get them to relax.”
But there was no respite for Bingo
O’Malley and Caryl Opshinsky, the
two actors in the Pittsburgh
Laboratory Theatre’s production of
Tennessee Williams"‘0ut Cry.”
According to Bill Roysten, who
adopted and directed “Out Cry,”
this is only the third time the play

‘has been produced. Like most of

Williams’ recent plays. “Out Cry”
has been scorned by critics and
ignored by audiences. I can't say
for sure whether the original “Out
Cry” deserved what it got in the
past, as only the rarest of
bookstores would have a copy. But
after seeing PLT’s successful
production, I can begin to
understand why the play may have
previously bombed.

“Out Cry” involves a brother-

The Amazing Death Defiers

' BY M. PATRICK MONAHAN

“Whether it’s right or wrong,
it’s something a man just has to
do,” cooed Hollywood bombshell
Jill St. John.

“Enough’s enough,” mumbled a
petriﬁed Telly (supercop) Savalas.

What was the topic of conversa-
tion these two screenland stars were

’ discussing? A hot, passionate love

scene? Dinner at eight? A hair
transplant?

No, none of these mundane
topics—it had more meat. Telly and
Jill were discussing the bizarre
rationale of six men who put their
lives on the line for the beneﬁt (or
disgust?) of the American television
viewing public.

Monday night, CBS telecast live a
program from the Chicago Amphi-
theatre showing six daredevils
risking their lives in various ways.
Savalas and St. John were the big
names ineptly chosen to comment
on the proceedings.

Deﬁers,” and if you enjoy the
opportunity of possibly seeing a
human being die right before your
very eyes, the show was tailor-made
for your tastes.

The “star” of the show, Evel
Knievel, was supposed to pull off
the ultimate death de’fier—-a jump
on his motorcycle across a pool
stocked with 13 lemon sharks—but
there was one minor complication.
Knievel, the man who thrilled
millions by plummeting a rocket-
powered motorcycle into the Snake
River, wrecked while attempting a
practice run earlier in the day. He
watched the show from the hospital.

Ah, but there were ﬁve other men
assembled to show America the
courage and skillful deeds manda-
tory for all true daredevils. The first
act provided a real bang.

BY PAMELA EUSI

It's a real shame a “blizzard”
had to strike the Pittsburgh area
this particular weekend. The
Pittsburgh Opera offered a special
treat in its production of “The
Bartered Bride” by Bedrich
Smetana. r

This production featured not only
the imported singing stars A and
talented character playing common
to Pittsburgh's opera company, but
local talent consisting of members

of the dance group, the Tambur-'

itzans, and acrobats from the
Evans Dance Studio. '
Because of the pseudo-blizzard,
events at Heinz Hall were cancelled
for the rest _ of the weekend.
Thursday night's crowd was the
onlyone to take part in this feast
for the eyes, ears and soul.
Kudos belong to Barbara Karp
for her stage directions and her
grand design for the entire show.
There comes a time when a stage

‘ can support a certain amount of

people and then the scene loses

effectiveness through loss of '

control and population explosion.

Karp knew where she wanted the
people and when. Heinz Hall
rarely sees crowd scenes that
aren't boring and tedious.

Another plus for the work was
that it was in English and it was a
comedy. Amid all the dreary
winter news, this opera provided
the needed comic relief to help one
make it through the term. The fact
that its libretto was in English was
plain old nice. America is one of
the few countries that doesn’t
translate every. opera given here
into English. We like to keep it in
its original tongue for that certain
folksy ﬂair and to boost our egos as
respectors of national origins.

Ellen Shade was a good Marie.
She had the right stage presence
and vocal range for the role. Shade
did some ﬁne acting in Act III in
which Marie believes her ﬁancee is
unfaithful to her but the traditional
operatic vocal slides were overdone
in her arias.

As Marie's lover. Jenik. Robert
Johnson was superb musically and
dramatically. He brought life onto

' the stage whenever he entered-

quite an accomplishment. His rich
tenor blended well with the darker
colors of Shade’s soprano. He was
the embodiment of youth and love,
which were the o.pera’s main
themes.

Some of the best comic moments
of the night occurred when either

Andrew Foldi (Kecal) or Arthur‘

Graham (Vasek) were onstage.
Kecal is a self-assured matchmaker
and Vasek is the stuttering.
backward man Kecal's trying to get
Marie to marry. Both provided
moments of outrageous comedy
and excellent character portrayals.

The Tamburitzans and the local
acrobatsproved to be a stroke of
local luck and interesting additions

 to an‘_alr_eady good show

The Question Oflnnocence

his innocence to every opponent,

judge and doubter. At times, Josef
K. himself is his biggest doubter.

The idea of Josef K.’s mind
working as‘a character of its own,
trying to rid itself of fabricated
feelings of guilt, appears to be
dominant in “The Trial.” The
shadow player, who represented an
image of his thoughts, supports that
concept.

' Franz, one of the ﬁrst connected
to Josef’s arrest, says “Don’t make
such an incident out of feeling
innocent.” It was a difficult feeling
for Josef to maintain as his “trial”
continued indeﬁnitely. His actions
were as erratic as the condition of
the arrest.

Immediately after his arrest, he

instantly demanded a lawyer, only 1

pI_a_y—shifting our perspective en-
tirely.

The play within the play is a
gothic melodrama that seems to be
Williams’ parodying of his own
style of high melodrama. The story__
line goes like this: The surviving
daughter and son of a southern
mystic who has killed himself and

.his wife, leaving behind only a

revolver and the_ taunts of the
neighborhood—become immobiliz-
ed’ in their own home, without
money, without courage enough to
reach for help.

The two characters slip in and out

roIes——their ‘names remain "the
‘same and their identities are the
same. But inone aspect, there is a
difference between" the real and

‘ created roles. In the created ones

they lack the courage necessary to
cope with their fears——b‘ut as real

people they are not immobilized.

I\/Ielodramatic, Human  

Williams is able to get away with
an. overdose of melodrama in his
play within the play but /the real
characters in “Out Cry” are often
too high-sounding. Perhaps, we

I can blame that on their insanity.

But still the intensity of their manias
lacks the sensitivity and reflective-
ness of a Blanche,Dubois. And
although their intensity dragged me
down into their mire. I couldn't
help-but be‘ aware of the sharp
break the language caused be-
tween the real world and the Lab

of the two acts. ‘then ‘my

Overall, the Lab Theatre_works a
difficult play well; I felt as

exhausted as the actors at the end.

They are not afraid to run a play
without a track record. “Out Cry”
is not your usual theatre fare. I
certainly needed that cup of tea at
the end.

deciding he doesn’t need one.
Josef is told to go about his daily
business as though ‘nothing hap-

« pened. But that was hard to do.

The court he faced was different
than any legal system to be seen.
His trial announcement included a
message saying he did not have to
be present and that it should not
interfere with his work.

Though I am uncertain, the court
and its lunatic members appeared
to be just anough aspect of Josef’ s
conscience. .He understandably
thought of his arrest and trial as a
joke or a bad dream.

The Studio Theatre devised a set
that used an abundance of space
and time within the performance.
The audience was pushed into one
side of the theatre while set
constructions consumed the other
three sides.

Aiding the play during the trial
scene, a central stage area
dominated the main space. Nearest
the audience was a scene used as
Josef’s'—off1ce. The opposite side
was set up as his home. A lawyer's
home, with a painter’s apartment
above, rested to the left of the
audience;

While the set was original and
interesting in its style, it also
hindered the show with technical
awkwardness.

' The latter part of “The Trial” is

supposed‘ to be suspense-filled,

based on a fast-moving show with
quick scenes. The paceof the
Studio production at that point
broke the suspense built up toward
the conclusion.

Despite‘ any of the play’s
shortcomings, -it is’ obvious that
much hard work was pumped into a
difficult project. The Studio
Theatre put itself on trial with a very
different project.

He survived, but moments after
the explosion, Kissleburg, attired in
just a tuxedo, looked wobbly
enough for the drunk tank. And,

- according to the lovely Jill, ‘Orville

has lost 30 per cent of his hearing
since he started this act.”

Next came J umpin’ Joe Gerlach,
whose act is jumping from an
84-foot platform into a sponge.
Shaking like a leaf, trying to pull
himself together on the platform,
Gerlach ﬁelded insightful questions
from St. John.

“Jumpin’ Joe, how are you going
to do this?” said St. John.

“I’m going to try to hit the

1 center,” replied a terriﬁed J umpin’
_ Joe. '

“You're a man of remarkable
courage, Jumpin’ Joel” chipped in
Telly.

Well Jumpin’ Joe made it, too,
but if the guy doesn't die from an
extreme case of nerves in the next
two years, his body should be

Following Jumpin’ Joe was Ron
Phillips. He tried to drive a
snowmobile off a ramp. He didn’t
make it. All he got for his trouble
was a frostbitten behind.

Two of the daredevils performed
their stunts in Miami. Dave
Merriﬁeld, a well-known aerialist,
hung dangerously from a helicopter
circling 800 feet above the city.
Even the usually cucumber-cool
Telly lost his stomach on this one.

‘‘If this is what live television is
supposed to be about, I don’t think
we should be doing it. Enough is
enough, Dave, please come on
down.”

Another well-known aerialist,
tightrope walker Karl Wallenda, 72,
literally put his life on the line. He
tiptoed across a wire spanning two
Miami hotels.

In his “up close and personal”
interview (all the men had footage
discussing their feats), we even got
to see a, staged conversation

between Wallenda and his sup-

posedly reluctant wife.

“Karl, please don’t do it,” Mrs.
Wallenda pleaded.

‘ “Honey, I’ve been doing it for 50
years, ” said Wallenda, stroking her
hand, “it’s something I have to
do.” Too bad his successful walk
was cut short by a commercial.

“Imagine, Telly, the man is 72
years‘ old.’ ’

“What courage, Jill!”

Mercifully, the show ended
without any major catastrophes;
unless you consider Savalas’ and St.
John’s butchering of the m.c.
chores. From their performances,
it’s obvious that Telly /should stick to
sucking lollipops and capturing the
sharpies of television’s underworld,
while Jill should limit herself to
toothpaste commercials.

The program was an obvious
ratings ploy on the part of CBS.
ABC was broadcasting the admit-
tedly dull, but usually high-rated,
American Music Awards, in an
overlapping time period. CBS
realized the regularly scheduled

half-hour situation comedies just
wouldn’t cut it.

“Evil Knievel’s Death Defiers”
was filled with realistic and morbid
possibilities—death, for example.
The next time CBS is placed into a
similar ratings bind the viewing
public can expect more of the same.

How about an hour special

Hoopsters ’ Lewis, Rice

BY ems HALL '

“There are no bright spots when you’re losing,’ according to
Sonny Lewis. Maybe not, but Lewis and fellow freshman Mike Rice are.
at the very least, 60-watt successes in their ﬁrst season at Pitt.

“I’m not a star yet,” says Lewis, who, with Rice and 6-11 freshman
center Ed Scheuermann, is part of a luminary trio that ﬁgures to guide
Pitt to not-so-future court successes. I

Lewis and Rice have played well this season and are perhaps the only
two Panthers to have turned. in above-par performances this 4-14 year.
When each says, “I’ve been playing well,” he is not stretching the
truth. '

Rice has been Pitt’s steadiest player, having started every game and

!

  

  

\

played the entire 40 minutes in one
(Notre Dame). He makes half his
ﬁeld goal attempts, is the team’s
third-leading scorer and its leading
rebounder. And when taking on an
entire opposing front wall inside, he
makes one wonder how tragic it
might be were he not a Panther-
and were he not the only Panther

. familiar with staying under for the
rebound. ~

Lewis hasn’t been steady——incon-
sistency is his plague thus far—but

 

MICHL RICE

that is overlooked easily, as, at times, he has been the most exciting
basketball player to play in Pittsburgh since Billy Knight. Before
Knight, there were none who could challenge Nathan “Sonny” Lewis’
ability to control a basketball game and captivate an audience.

Lewis, though often playing musical positions, hits more than half his

3 shots from the ﬁeld, is the team’s second-leading scorer and

occasionally, spectacularly and assertively adds some dominating
presence around (and often above) the hoops. His slamming and
rejecting caused one dazed, 6-6 West Virginia Mountaineer to mutter,
“Man that little 6-3 dude sure got up and got off over us.”

Rice adds 12 points and 10 rebounds to the average Pitt attack;

Sonny’s contributions are 12 points
and three rebounds from a guard
position.

For both, the season has been
more than all right. Fixtures in

form Pitt’s program into a winner. »

“This year’s been alright,” claims Lewis. “And things are going to
be better. I should be snatching rebounds more. Everybody should be
shooting more—taking the good shots instead of letting them go.”'

Rice is similarly bent upon change for the better. “Ishould be
shooting, scoring and rebounding more, ’ ’ he says, apparently forgetting
his freshman ﬁgures. I know it, and Coach (Bob) Hill knows it. He gets
on me because he wants me to be better—the best.”

The road to being better is not an easy one, as these freshmen have
found. A missed layup in ‘a recent practice brought Rice a several-lap
penalty from Hill. ‘ ‘No excuse for missing layups, is there, Mike?’ ’ said
Hill the ﬁrst time the jogging Rice passed. “That should have been
dunked, shouldn’t it?” was Hill’s remark another time around.

Rice didn’t like the running, but realizes its worth. ‘ ‘Makes you think
about those layups,” he says.

Despite the dismal record, both
Rice and Lewis say they’re happy to
be sporting the Blue and Gold.

“Knowing we'll be better makes
me happy to be here,”-says Rice,
widening his familiar grin. “That’s
me,” he says. “Happy all the
time.”

All the time?

“Well, not all the time,” he says,
joining Sonny in a smile. “It’s just
that I like to be nice to people-—-off
the court.”

On the court, Lewis and Rice have
high aspirations—make that expec-
tations.

“Before it’s all over, I'll be an
All-American,” says Rice. “You
have to have that eonﬁdence——and
coach Hill will kill me if] don’t make
it.” I

Each wants to go pro, also. “Who
doesn’t?" says Sonny. “If I can
stay healthy..."

“I have to build up my body,”
says Rice, “but I think I have a
chance.”

Pitt fans hope their pro aspira-
tions will be denied for three years,
however. And each player,
unﬂagging in his praise and loyalty
to Grgurich, are hoping. too. A

“We just have to wait for it to
come around." says Rice. “That's
what keeps us going. We know
we'll be alright—and soon."

The verdict is in from the 8th
annual Pitt Indoor Track Invita-
tional: two winning. decisions by
Dan Goodyear and Eric Drescher
and two outstanding performances
by Mel Boyd and Rich Moore.

Despite the adverse weather and
energy crunch. there was a track
meet held at the Field House this
past weekend and it had many of
the qualities of a great meet.
Although a few teams—such as
West Virginia, Slippery Rock and
lndiana———didn't make the _trip
because of prior notiﬁcation of the
meet's cancelation as of noon
Friday. it was already too late for
distant traveling teams such as
Virginia Tech. East Carolina.
Delaware State and East Ten-
nessee to"turn back for home.
These teams and others were
already in Pittsburgh, so, as they
say in show biz, the show had to go
on.

The meet did go on in the
coal-heated Fitzgerald Field
House. and Mel Boyd and Rich
Moore are glad it did. Boyd placed-
second in the two-mile run. but
more importantly. ran an 8246 for
the distance. This time bettered
Boyd's former best time of 8:50 by
four seconds. 3

Moore also failed to take ﬁrst
Saturday. but he did manage to
crack his personal indoor best in
the half-mile run with a ﬁne time of
l:53.6. which placed him third.

Dan Goodyear and Eric Drescher
supplied the only wins of the day
for the Panthers. Goodyear won
the high jump with a flop of 6'8"
and Drescher had his best shot
performance of the year with a put
of 53'6".

Other high ﬁnishers for‘ the

Panthers included: Keith Taylor

a national hurdles champion and a
flock of Fitzgerald Field House
record-holders.

Pitt's Pantherettes. idle last
weekend because of hazardous
weather conditions. will host 14 of
the top women's teams in the East.
Perhaps the brightest star appear-

Maryland andthe Pantherettes will
miss her tosses of 39 feet and more.

“The mile should be the race of ‘

the day." exclaimed Pitt coach
Mary Ellen Shea. “What with

Webb of Wright State and Kris
Bankcs. Kathy, Mills. Donna
Gardner and Hilary Nodcn of Penn
State all sparkled in the 1976
Association for Intercollegiate
Athletics for Women (AIAW)

lNDIANAPOLIS——Has success
spoiled Billy Knight?

“No, I don’t think I’ve changed at
all,” Knight reflected while un-
winding in the Pacers’ locker room
after a recent‘ seven-point victory

over the New Orleans Jazz at

Market Square Arena in Indianapo-

’ lis.
g “I’m still basically the same-
, person I've always been,” he

continued. “I don’t smoke, drink,
or stay out late at night. I just

A I prefer the quiet life, you know, just

relax a lot and listen to some good
music. I guess I just don’t like the
spotlight. ’ ’

But the way “Mooney” has been
tearing the NBA apart lately, it is

becoming increasingly difﬁcult to -

avoid the spotlight. By averaging
more than 32 points per game in his
last 15 games, Knight has moved

 Pitt’s Knight Dubbed

into third place in the NBA scoring
race, trailing only superstars
“Pistol” Pete Maravich of New
Orleans and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,
the game's dominating giant, of the
Los Angeles Lakers. A
Known as “Smooth” in NBA
circles, Knight is currently averag-
ing 26.1 points per game, while
shooting an outstanding 49.6%
percent from his “big guard”
position. He is gathering 6.2

rebounds per contest in about 38*

minutes of action, and shooting 80.7
percent from the foul line. In
addition, Billy is dishing out 3.4
assists per game and playing tough
defense.

“Bill isytruly a coming super-
star,” remarked Indiana coach
Bobby Leonard. “He comes to play
every night, something a lot of
so-called ‘superstars’ don’t do.
Even with opponents double-team-
ing him at times, it seems Bill

need one.”

“Mooney” has successfully_
made the transition from ABA
forward to NBA guard, no small
task for a guy who spent most of his
college days as a forward.

“I’m really glad to be playing in
the NBA, but I don’t think I had
anything to prove coming in from

I‘ the ABA. The players all knew I

could play and some of the
toughest guys I have to go against

I are from the ABA——guys like David

Thompson and George Gervin—but
everybody’s good around here,
really.”

The 6-6, 195-lb. sharpshooter,
who is second on the Pitt all-time
scoring list with 1,731 points
(trailing only another All-American,
Don Hennon, who scored 1,841 in
the late ﬁfties), Billy is now looking

1 forward to his first NBA all-star

game, to be played Sunday,
February 13 in Milwaukee.

“Sure, it would be nice, and.I
think I deserve to be there, ’ ’ Knight
said, “but if not I’ll just use the time
to get a little extra rest.”

Knight is paired in the Pacer
backcourt with Don Buse, a 6-4,
195-lb. dynamo who is the league’s
greatest anticipator, leading the
NBA in steals and assists.’

“Buse is not ﬂashy, but he gets
the job done,” said Knight. “He’s
probably our best all-around player,
but we lack backcourt depth.”

Although the Pacers weren’t
given much of a shot by the experts
before the season began, they have
remained close to .500 during the
first half of the season, and hope to,
put it all together down the stretch
and make the playoffs.

Up front, veterans Wilbert Jones
and Darnell Hillman carry most of

the load, while second-year pro Dan
Roundﬁeld saw most of the recent
action at center while last year’s
regular, Len Elmore, recovered
from a broken foot. Elmore just
recently returned to action.

“We’ll.be a, lot stronger with Len
back,” said Knight. “He plays the
real tough defense.”

At his new “big guard” position
Knight encounters the likes of the
aforementioned Maravich, Thomp-
son and Gervin, along with Phil
Chenier,. Doug Collins, Charlie
Scott, Walt Frazier, Phil Smith,
Randy Smith, Austin Carr, etc.
etc._’—so Mooney is really “doing

Redic photo

his thing” against the best.

“It’s really hard to get mentally
prepared for 82 games,” he
confessed, “But if you don’t these
guys will just tear you up.”

Evidently, Knight does go out on
the court every night mentally
prepared, because it is he who has
been showing the NBA stars a thing
or two with remarkable consistency.

He is still the same rather shy,
soft-spoken, clean-living good guy
he’s been ‘since coming from
Braddock to Pitt and on to the great
arenas of the NBA.

No, success hasn’t spoiled Billy
Knight.

If the third time is a charm, then

(EWL) bout, right? _

Wrong. Pitt had better bizing

beat 16th-ranked Clarion (9-2), an
arch-rival’ in the EWL. *~

“They’re always tough,” co-
captain Bill Bailey claimed. “We'll
have to wrestle well.”

For the two years the EWL has
been in existence, the final
outcome of the team race has
always been predictable: Penn
State in first place, Clarion in
second, Pitt in third. This year, the

while Bill Clark (118),

nagging injuries.

The remaining starting crew is
about the same one which has
treated Pitt to a 5-2 record, namely
Brian Jacobs or Jose Martinez at
126, Steve Carter at 134, Kevin

Terps Top Tankers With
Larger Point Toto, 58-55

BY JIM GEFSKY

Does head swim coach Dick
Bradshaw have something in
common with Dorothy of Wizard of
Oz fame? Well, possibly, for just
like the Kansas gal who journeyed
so far to the Emerald City, only to be
sent away by the wily wizard,
Bradshaw and his tankers traveled
a huge distance, to College Park,
Maryland, only to be handed one of
the most heart-breaking of losses.

The Panther swimmers were
leading. 55-51, with only the
free style relay
remaining. The event was neck
and neck, but the electronic.
touch-controlled timer gave Pittfs
time as 3:11.68 and Maryland’s as
3:11.63—a .05 second difference.
Thus, the Terrapins achieved a
58-55 meet _victory despite a gallant
Panther effort.

Pitt did have many bright
moments, though, most of them
because of Jerry DeMuro and Mark
Schuman. DeMuro won three
events——the 1000-yard freestyle,
with a time, of 10:04.62; the-
500-yard freestyle with a 4:44.35;
and the 200-yard butterﬂy with a

1:58.52. Schuman took th_e

.100-yard freestyle in 47.86 sec-

onds. and also captured the
200-yard individual medley with a
time of 1257.8.

Pitt also did well in diving,
taking second and third in the
three-meter dive (an event that
featured the return of Tom Fatyol,
who was recovering from the flu),
and finishing one-two
one-meter dive through the efforts
of Scott Winkler and Jeff Shaffer,
respectively.

Bradshaw, however was not
dismayed. ‘‘It was one of the
closest meets we've ever had," he
said. “On paper, they were better
than us, but we still gave one of our
best performances of the year. I
still feel that with a lot of work we
can A still beat them in the
Easterns." . '

The tankers‘ next match is this
Saturday, when they travel to
Morgantown to face the West
Virginia Mountaineers. The
Panthers. now 4-2, will have their
hands full, as West Virginia is
quickly building a strong swim-
ming program and, according to

Bradshaw, could easily win half the _

scheduled events,

SHORT GAS SUPPLIES LEAVE
SCHOOLS CLOSED

HARRISBURG (AP)—Many
schools fueled by gas are likely to
remain closed for the rest of the
week because of critically short
natural gas supplies, utility officials
said Tuesday. ‘

An estimated 2,500 public
schools heated by fuels other than
natural gas reopened Tuesday, said
Michael McLaughlin, Gov. Shapp’s
press secretary.

Equitable Gas Co. of Pittsburgh
asked its 475 schools to stay shut
through this weekend.

Columbia Gas Co. told its 164
schools in central and western
Pennsylvania they can have only
enough gas through March to keep
the buildings from freezing, a
spokesman said.

“We really haven't ﬁgured out
how to cope with that,”, said Leroy
Kite, superintendent at Quaker
Valley school district near Pitts-

burgh. “We may have to rely a lot _

on body heat.”

National Fuel Gas of Erie told the
schools to set their thermostats at 55
degrees. A company spokesman
said some of the 300 schools have
elected to stay closed.

Health officials have recommend-
ed that schools close if they cannot
maintain temperatures of at least 62
degrees.

The state on Monday ordered
UGI Corp. and Philadelphia Electric
to restore supplies to their 60
school customers. , ‘

The state Education Department
said the schools were to meet with
the _two utilities before opening.
Only Pennsylvania Gas and Water
of Wilkes-Barre had enough gas to
meet school requirements, a

spokesman said. The company -

serves 150 schools in eight
northeastern and «north-central ,
counties. ,

Peoples Gas of Pittsburgh said
Tuesday afternoon it had not
reached a decision on schools.

Spokesman Hal Mason said some
of the 95 districts served by Peoples
also are customersof Equitable and
Columbia. Those districts might
decide to stay shut regardless of
Peoples’ decision, he said. '

The state Public Utility Commis-
sion was making a district-by-
district review Tuesday of schools
fueled by gas. .

Shapp closed the schools Thurs-
day to help save natural gas for
residential needs over ‘the past
weekend.

Across the state, large industrial
customers still had only enough gas
to protect their plants.

Statewide layoffs hovered around
the 90,000 mark, but were expected
to climb to 135,000 by week’s end,
said Labor and Industry Secretary
Paul Smith.
