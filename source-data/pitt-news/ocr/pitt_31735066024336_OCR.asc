When Rollo Turner arrived to teach
Blacks in Sports on Friday, he was met by
a campus police officer and black studies
Chair Brenda Berrian, who told Turner he
was suspended from the university.

Berrian suspended Turner on Thursday,
but he still showed up to teachhis classes
the next day, saying he had not received
adequate conﬁrmation from the dean of
the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. A

After Turner walked into the classroom,
Berrian told the students that Turner had
been suspended and said other faculty

.members would be teaching his classes. A

campus police officer was stationed outside
the classroom in Langley Hall.

An hour later Berrian addressed the
students in the Black Family class Turner
had been teaching. Again she told the
students Turner was suspended. _

“If you took the course just because
Rollo Turner is teaching it, the time to
leave is now,” Berrian _told the Black
Family class. “If you are here because you
actually want to learn something about
the black family, sign the [class roster
being circulatedl.” C

“Is there any reason why he was
suspended?” a student asked Berrian. She

said she could not comment.

Turner has said the chair and Faculty of
Arts and Sciences Dean Peter Koehler
have been conspiring to fire him because
he refused to teach a third class without
extra pay. Berrian and Koehler have refused
further comment.

University spokesperson Tim Ziaukas
confirmed that Turner was suspended with
pay and a hearing will take place soon to
review his suspension. “[Berrian] is trying
to do this with all considerations and
professionalism,” he said.

Turner said his suspension stems from a
rift in the black studies department and a
lack of respect for his research, which

Pitt economist

By Mark Carlin
stag Writer

Just when you thought it was safe to
graduate from college, the recession reared
its ugly head. If you’re planning to get a
job, think again -— grad school’s not so
bad. .

Reuben Slesinger, professor emeritus of
economics at Pitt, predicted a sluggish

. economy until at least mid—1992 during his
annual economic forecastat the Tree of
Life Synagogue in Squirrel Hill.

“The economy is like an elephant in a
small room. You can turn it around, but
you have to be very, very careful not to get
trampled,” Slesinger said.

According to Slesinger, blaming Japan
for America’s economic problems is futile.
Until American industry can provide
cheaper products thatAmerican consumers

will buy, complaining aboutjapanese trade
practices will be useless, he said. A

“We are a consumer—driven economy,
and consumers are going to buy what they
want to buy. There is very little that Bush
and the Congress can do that will make
any difference.”

Referring to Bush’s recent trade
agreement with Japan, Slesinger said,
“Getting Japan to import 20,000 more cars
annually is no big deal. That will keep the
auto industry going for about one day,
maybe two,” _ A

Normally, a government will increase
spending on the“nation’s infrastructure to
stimulate the economy, which creates jobs.
he said. But with federal and state deficits
so high, there is not enough money to
increase spending on roads and bridges,
he said. ’ _

Slesinger said consumer confidence is

predicts slnggts/9

very low and the economy will continue
to stumble. The Federal Reserve must
continue to lower interest rates, particularly
long-term interest to businesses so they
can invest in capital expenditures. He also
recommendedscalingback onentitlements
and subsidies. .

He favors lowering or eliminating almost
all other taxes in favor of a national sales
tax. “This would tax people based on
consumption, not on savings or investment
earnings.”

'.While Slesinger feels -there _ is little
politicians can do directly, he does expect
that the economy will ‘improve’ in late
spring and early summeras presidential
campaign promises raise consumer
expectations. '  V

Students can overcome procrastination

By. Barbara. Hoffmann
stag‘ W1-iter

Procrastination strikes the best
of us once in _a while, but for
others it can be a -serious
condiition. : 5,

‘¥I’ll”cle'an my room, wash the
dishes oranything, just to keep
froh1_doing what I haveto do,”
saidifstesve Nolan, a_ Pitt senior.

Profcrastiniatorsl are not lazy —
they. find other things to do in
order to’ delay a task until‘ the last
possible minute, said David Reily
of the Pitt counseling center.

“Waiting for all the right
conditions to come together or
all the planets to line up to feel it
is now time to start is not likely to
happen," Reily said.

People procrastinate for many
reasons. Some believe the project
or situation they are putting off is

going to be a terrible experience.

Other procrastinators may be
perfectionists who avoid tasks
because they are afraid of failure,
he said. There is also fear of
success. If there is success in a

certain area, then more demands 1
_ may be put on a person, -Reily"
said, and peoplefear the _

unknown.

“Another [situation] some
' people might not{think~ of

procrastination is putting
something off and then being
propelled by the last—rn_inute
deadline,” Reily said.

This pattern. can become
unhealthy and can have negative
consequences. Procrastination
may lead to a string of failures,
according to Reily.

Pitt junior Danielle Dubois said
she also procrastinates by
avoiding schoolwork. She cleans
her apartment, scrubs her
bathroom ﬂoor and talks on the

phone but" eventually gets her
work done.

But her habit has caused the
stress disorder TM], or grinding
of the teeth while sleeping.

“If it gets really bad, I’ll "shake.
My hands shake and I get sick
and nauseated," Dubois said.

Both Nolan and Dubois said

- they always think the next term
_ will be different and they will not
. procrastinate.

But even though they may do
well for the first few weeks, they
fall back into their old rut, they

said.

“It’s kind of like the New Year’s
resolutions. People make all of
these’ grand and glorious
resolutions, but it’s always easier
to fall back into the patterns that
are most familiar,” Reily said.

But it is not an incurable
situation.

According to Reily, if a person

can identify the reasons why they
procrastinate, they have taken
the first step to ending the habit.

Then they must start. Students
who are trying to get schoolwork
done should look for a place
where they can concentrate, such
as a well—1it, quiet area.

Dividing up study time by
working for an hour and taking a
five-minute break instead of
expecting to study four straight
hours also helps end
procrastination.

“Everyone can write out their
schedule and block in an hour to
study today and two hours to
study tomorrow,” Reily said. “Such
a variation in [college] schedules
can make it difficult sometimes
for people to find out where all of
their time is going.”

Breaking tasks into smaller
parts also helps, according to
Reily.

Anthro prof studies
gender issues in India

By Manuel Hernandez
For The Pitt News

If an office were able to speak
of its occupant, one particular
office would have a lot to say.
The walls, lined with posters of
faraway countries, almost
resemble a travel agency; the
bookshelves are brimming with
almost every anthropology book
imaginable.

A newsletter sits on the
conference-like table, waiting to
be edited. Behind the desk sits
the creator of this “anthro-
pological heaven,” Professor
Barbara Miller.

Her interest in anthropology
surfaced in high school, when
Miller was fascinated with classical
cultures, archaeology and foreign
countries. She obtained most of
her exposure to foreign cultures
through photographs in
encyclopedias. Her summer
vacations were spent within the
confines of the United States.

“I didn’t really enjoy vacationing
in the U.S. I always wanted to go
further and experience new
cultures, instead of packing in
the family car and going to
Washington D.C.,” she said.

Miller received all her»post-
secondary education at Syracuse
University. Initially, she majored
in areas such as French, the fine
arts and education. Her final
choice came down to either
religion or anthropology, with
anthropology winning out “by
the toss of the coin.”

Her junior year of
undergraduate study was spent

in India. After receiving her‘

doctorate in anthropologyin 1978,
she remained at Syracuse, where
she spent several years in a
teaching and research position.
She later moved to Ithaca
University.

Since receiving her doctorate,
Miller has devoted much of her
time to research, completing
extensive research on health in
many small villages of India. Her
1981 book The Endangered Sex
focuses on the health of young
Indian women.

Her major research project took
Miller to Jamaica, where she
successfully worked with a team
of economists to help low—income
Jamaicans paying high taxes.

“Working with the Jamaican
team helped me learn to be on
my toes and be able to respond.
to any tasks that came up. I also
learned to find out howl could fit
into other areas of the project
and be of whatever help I could
be.”

She is now updating her
research on India, which will

include a second book on Indian
women’s health, Let Her Live.

She has also co-authored a book
on Sri Lanka and recently edited
a l7—chapter book which will be
published soon.

“I always thought I'd be happy
in life with a husband, a child and
a book, but now I’m going to
have a husband, a child and
more than one book, so that’s
good.”

Miller, 42, has been a Pitt faculty
member for just over two years.
This is her first full-time teaching
position.

“Pitt has a very strong
anthropology department on the
national level and is a great
university in general. I couldn’t
be happier to be a part of Pitt,”
she said.

She’s chosen to specialize in
medical anthropology, which
deals with human welfare and
the effect of cultural inﬂuences.
Cultures influence to which
diseases people are susceptible,
she said.

Her primary goal is to
strengthen the bonds between
medical anthropology and the
medical school.

“I would love to be able to
better train medical students in
socio—cultural ‘aspects of
medicine. I feel it is essential to
have some of this training to help
make good doctors. We have a
multi-cultural society in the United
States. What is considered a
symptom of disease in one society
may be considered a symptom of
wellness in another society.”

Beyond her busy academic
schedule, she also has informal
meetings with Hindu students at
Pitt to talk about “almost anything
related to India.”

She gives talks to Indian youth
groups on growing up in America
and values of Hinduism from an
American perspective. “I have
formed an excellent friendship
with many Hindu families in
Pittsburgh. They have basically
adopted me into their culture.”

She also edits an international
anthropological newsletter
published by the Committee on
Women in Asian Studies, a project
she started 10 years ago.

“We try to give visibility to
those who work on gender in
Asian studies. It also helps
everyone keep track of each
other’s work so we can support
each other.” T

Miller resides in Churchill and
has been happily married to her
college sweetheart for almost 20
years. The two have a 12-year-
old son who attends Falk School.
She also enjoys seeing Pirates

, For T be PM News

When campaigning in 1987,
President George Bush told
interviewer Rob Sherman, “I don’t
think that atheists should be
considered citizens nor should
they be considered patriots. This
is ‘one nation under God.’"

Pittsburgh Secular Humanists
would like to challenge that
statement. The group promotes
humanism, which searches for
rational, rather than su pernatural,
explanations of the universe and
human behavior.

It has lasted thousands of years
and has been practiced by people
like Socrates and John Dewey.
PSI-I wants to provide a non-
religious alternative to people
who don't believe in God but
believe in moral values.

PSH President Victor Bernard
said that humanists are currently
under attack. Since the group is
not considered a religious
organization, many other religious
groups have blamed them for

moral problems facing America
today.

The Pitt News: What is the
purpose of your organization?

Victor Bernard: We have a
number of goals. One is to be a
social focus for secular humanists.
In the past we didn’t have
churches, so we couldn’t get in
contact with people who thought
along similar lines. Now we can
go on trips, see plays together,
and have discussion groups on
various topics. _

Another purpose is to provide
an educational service, so people
can learn whatsecular humanism

is all about.
PN: What is secular
humanism all about?

VB: We tend to reject the
concept of God. Some of us are
agnostics, who consider that God
might be a possibility, while others
are atheists, who reject the
concept altogether. But we
do believe in values. We believe
in the dignity of the individual,
and that each person should be
treated with respect and

compassion.

We allow people the maximum
freedom to live their lives as they
see fit. Our moral philosophy us
that you judge your actions by
the results they have on others.
True, you might have freedom,
but in accepting that, you must
also accept responsibility for your
actions.

In short, humanism epitomizes
the basic concepts of our country:
that we are entitled to individual
liberties and that ethical behaviors
require democratic institutions.

PN: If that’s the case, then
why would President Bush
have made such a disparaging
remark against atheists?

VB: This quote was made when
he was campaigning in 1987. The
interviewer says that the president
deeply believes his religion. That
is probably true. It’s also possible
that this was a calculated political

statement designed to appeal to

the religious Right.

PN: Why, in this land where
people are entitled to their
own beliefs, would certain
religious groups condemn
humanists?

VB: Some people first learn
about Secular humanism from
evangelists like Jimmy Swaggart
orjerry Falwell who don’t paint a
positive picture. They blame us
for the drug culture and today’s
“anything goes” attitude.

But we don’t promote
hedonism. We are not out to
corrupt American youth. In PSH,

 PI'I'I‘ NEWS, Monday, January_ 13,, 

Pittsburgh secularhumanist discusses moral beliefs

most of us are probably as
conventional as anybody who
goes to church. Our morality,
like religiously inspired morality,
stems from human experience.

Churchgoers are frightened by
those who reject religion. They
feel threatened. I believe this is
because they haven’t examined
what their religion truly means.

Many go to church out of force
of habit; their parents go, so they
go too. But they haven’t examined
themselves or compared their
value systems to others.

Of course, some religious
people do, and then their faith
grows stronger. These people
aren't as inclined to feel
threatened by humanists.

PN: Then your group isn’t
out to subvert religions?

VB: Certainly not! I believe all
religious and non—religious
people can exists side by side,
peacefully, and work together to
make America a better
community.

PN: You don’t really hear
much about attacks on atheists
in the news these days.

VB: A lot of it doesn’t go
reported. A few years ago, Pat
Robertson, while running for
president, said that only Christians
and Jews should be allowed to
hold public office. He said this on

the 700 Club, on national TV! But.

this was not reported by any
major news magazine until toward
the end of the campaign.

And then there’s the Christian

 

Reconstructionist Movement, a
political party that wants to set up
a Christian theocratic state. They
would like to bring back, the
death penalty for adultery,
juvenile delinquency, witchcraft
and blasphemy. It is possible
that, as an atheist, I could be
condemned to death for saying. I

don’t believe in God. And what I

aboutjews, Muslims or Buddhists?

Now the average American
probably doesn’t condemn
humanists, probably couldn’t
even care less. But there is a
significant minority that are
vocally and vehemently opposed
to us. Now people say we
shouldn’t worry about that, but I
wonder how many said the same
thing to the Jews in Germany
during the rise of Hitler?

PN: Do you really think a
holocaust could occur in
which humanists and others
are wiped out? .

VB: I don’t necessarily see
radicals coming to power yet.
But as somebody once said, “All
that is necessary for evil to triumph
is for good men to do nothing.”

PN: What do you think
causes the moral problems in
our society today?

VB: Primarily,’ the failure of
individuals to accept
responsibility. As a society, we
are too interested in instant
gratification. As long as we’re
happy, we don’t care about others.
Consider today’s sexual relations.

Mascots skate at Schenley

By Larry Chough
SuyTIVfﬂer

The Schenley Park ice-skating
rink offers inexpensive and
romantic recreation throughout
the winter season for students.

Special Events Coordinator for
Citiparks Eric Van said, “We
understand how poor most
college students are. That’s why
our special student ID night is a
great time to skate.”

ID night, which is every
Tuesday, offers anyone with a
student ID admission to the rink
at half price. “It’s clearly a venue
for students,” Van said.

“The ice—skating rink is a great
place for romance and an
inexpensive date. One Valentine’s

_ Day we had a couple get engaged

here ” Van said.

But the big event, according to
Van, will be on Jan. 16, when the
rink will host its annual Mascot
Skate.

For this event, Citiparks invites
35 well-known and not—so-well-
known mascots from nearby
colleges and businesses.

Some of the mascots scheduled
to appear are the Pitt Panther, the
Penn'State Nittany Lion, the Heinz
Ketchup Bottle, the Steeler
Stinger, the KDKA Bear, the Pirate
Parrot, the B-94 Bee from WBZZ-
FM and Willy Water of the
Pittsburgh Water Department.

“Bet you didn’t know that the
water department had a mascot,”
Van said.

“It’s a great time to bring your
camera and get your picture taken
with a lot of crazy people —- and
you’ve just got to see the Heinz
Ketchup Bottle.”

A He said that this is the
longest running recession
since World War II. Retail
sales are in very bad shape,
particularly in large items
like cars and appliances.

Household net worth
has dropped $2 billion in
the last two years. In 1980,
family median income was
just under $39,000. In 1990,
it was around $37,000.

A lot of white-collar jobs
are being lost, he said.
“People who used to earn
$80,000 to $100,000 are out
of work and lucky to find a
$20,000—a—year job.”

what these people have been
doing in this department?” Anise
said. “When the administration
seems to be a backbone of such
actions it leads to demoralization
 This smells of persecution and
harassment.

Berrian sent a memo Jan. 10 to
black studies faculty, staff and
work—study students prohibiting
Turner access to “departmental
equipment, the storage room or
the work room. Do not give any
departmental keys to him until
further notice.”

“The black man in America is
an endangered species — he’s
endangered by his own black
woman.” Anise said.

Ron Brown is now teaching
Turner’s Blacks in Sports class.
Brown works for the Academic
Support Services for Student

Athletes. “This is an awkward

situation for eve one” Brown-
)

told the students. “Hopefully we
can get the course going."

Agnes Franklin, who is now
teaching Turner’s Black Family
class, said she doesn’t know
anything about the Turner case.
“They asked me to teach this
class, and that’s all I know."

Many students were outraged
that Berrian dismissed Turner in
front of his class. “It wasn’t
professional at all,” Pitt student
Tisa Williams said. “I liked
[Turner]. He really knew his stuff
 You need black men like him
in the community.”

Pitt student Travis Banks said
Berrian shouldn’t have told the
classes directly that Turner was
suspended. “It’s ridiculous. In so
many words they told him to get
out, right in front of his class.”

Q  Law _schoo_l , Dean Mark
 Nordenberg sent a letter last
.5 se~mester_,to all law students to
» clarify the law -school’s new

military recruitment procedures.
Military recruiters will no longer

~l inside the law school because of

the Department of Defense policy
which restricts homosexuals from

I _This decision was made based

on a series of meetings by a
number of different student

- organizations including the

 jrean clarifies  ban from

Student Bar Association, Pitt
Women's Law Association and
the Gay Rights Organization.

Concern about the military’s
policy which discriminates against
homosexuals: prompted the
students to takean initiative about
one year ago, when a coalition of
the members of various student
groups approached N ordenberg.

“The students felt the policies
of the military were inconsistent
with the notions of equality,”
Nordenberg said.

ﬂyer’s caption stated “Military
Recruiters'Banned From Pitt Law.”
The purpose of his letter was to
better inform the students of the
military-recruiting procedures at
the law school.

“Though many of the student
participants found the policies of
the military to be reprehensible,
they did not seek a total ban on
law-school participation in
military recruitment. Instead, they
acknowledged that the
opportunities presented by the
military would be attractive to
many students and indicated that
they had no desire to interfere in
any practically signiﬁcant way

 

with their classmates’ pursuit of
them,” Nordenberg stated in his
letter to the students.

The: law school’s procedures
for military recruitment are to
continue to advertise openings
for lawyers within the military
whenever requested to do so.
The law school will accompany
the advertisements with a notice
stating that the military excludes
homosexuals from military
service. '

Christine Biancheria, a member
of the law school’s Gay Rights
Organization, said she
Nordenberg’s policy is necessary
because “it is essential that we
give practical impact to our non-
discrimination policy rather than
be construed as fanciful and
hollow slogans.” .
Nordenberg stated in his letter,
“Our procedures attempt to strike
an appropriate balance between
competing points of view. The
very fact they embody
compromise reflects existing
uncertainty about the law itself,

and they were carefully crafted to .

take account of the real interests
of all who might be affected by
the placement process.”
Reaction from students and
representatives of all four branch-
es of the military has been pos-
itive, according to Nordenberg.
But some students remain
dissatisﬂed.“We don’t feel the
issue has ended. We feel we have
a legitimate concern, and we’re
not satisfied with the way things
stand. We’re going to try and
persuade the administration that
this is a situation that needs to be
revisited,” Amato said.

for subject age, Needleman said the IQ test he
used determines an individual’s IQ based on

the subject’s age, and therefore age adjustment ’

is built into the experiment.

Ernhart has challenged Needleman’s research
before, including a paper in 1982 in which she
argued that leaded gasoline was not harmful.
This recent challenge comes in the wake of a
court case for which Needleman was hired as an
expert witness for the prosecution and Ernhart
for the defense.

The U.S. government was suing Sharon Steel,
UV Industries and Atlantic Richfield Company
for $100 million to clean up lead tailings from a
smelter in Midvale, Utah.

The case was settled out of court for $63
million. -

Needleman said the companies decided to
settle because “they realized they didn’t have a
case.”

The dispute between Needleman and Ernhart
attracted the attention of the Office of Scientific
Integrity of the National Institutes of Health,
which asked to Pitt to conduct an investigation

of Needleman’s work, despite a 1984

U Environmental Protection Agency investigation

that found it to be correct.

Jane Schultz, University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center’s integrity officer, said the NIH asked Pitt
to conduct a study based on the claims that
selected and omitted data may have biased his
results.

A committee of four unnamed biostatisticians
will review his work and report their findings to
the NIH, Schultz said.

According to Needleman, Ernhart is pursing
him because the lead industry pays her to.

“The lead industry is very frightened, very
desperate, trying to personalize this by getting at
me,” he said. A

Ernhart said she is challenging Needleman
because she believes the government is spending
too much money researching the effects of lead
that she believes do not exist and such research
“diverts monies from things that matter to children,
like measles vaccines.”

According to Ernhart, as a scientist it is her
responsibility to monitor her colleagues because
the public does not have the expertise.

Moving to Pittsburgh was a
great adjustment for Miller, who
had grown up in rural upstate
New York. Traffic and the size of
the city were major changes for
the “country girl,” but she said
she has adjusted nicely.

“It takes a while to get used to
the Pittsburgh accent,
Pittsburghese, but I’m getting
better at it.”

She also enjoys fossil hunting
with her family and hiking
through the hills of western
Pennsylvania and West Virginia.

“Next to India, West Virginia is
one of the most beautiful places
I have ever seen. It’s full of such

natural beauty."

She plans to write another book
on the Hindu culture of Pittsburgh
and hopes to compare her
Pittsburgh project to India after
her son enters college. She would
also like to be a part of Pitt's
Semester at Sea program within
the next few years.

Professionally, she hopes to
develop more seminar-style
classes for students to give them
a more personal approach to
anthropology. ' .

She said she wants to help he
students become professionals
that can use their training to their
fullest extent.

“It’s a tough time for
professionals in the job market,
so we have got to be good.”

Big boys and girls

When a typical student at the University of Pittsburgh
does not attend classes, it is reﬂected in grade reports at
the end of each semester.

For athletes, there is more riding on class attendance
than disappointment in themselves. The majority are
suspended from their respective sports.

To combat this effect, a majority of Pitt athletes are
forced to participate in an attendance-card program,‘
whereby each individual professor must sign a card
stating that the particular athlete attended the class. ‘

Although the intent of these cards is to improve
attendance, grades and responsibility, they can also
backfire.

The cards must be signed by every instructor that a
player has for a six-week period each semester. If an
athlete fails to have a teacher sign a card, misses class or
loses a card, he or she must have the card signed for a 10-
week period. ,

Athletes should not be given precedence over other
students, and specialized programs such as the attendance-
card policy may be reinforcing negative stereotypes of
athletes among the remainder of the university community.

For years, athletes have been trying to eliminate the
rumor that they are incompetent jocks, and nothing more.
The card—attendance procedure contradicts all that they
have been fighting for.

Card signing may lead others to believe that student
athletes are irresponsible and would not go to class on
their own if given the chance.

Anyone who attends a university is expected to act and
be treated as an adult. . ,

Students old enough to attend a university should be
responsible and trusted enough to attend classes on their
own initiative in order to maintain the grade-point average
necessary to stay on their respective teams.

If a sport means as much to a student as we are led to
believe, they will do everything in their power to gain the
discipline they need to get acceptable grades — and they
should be able to do it on their own. -

Student athletes provide a service to the university, but
that does not mean Pitt and the athletic coaches should
have to monitor their every move.

College students know their priorities and should be
able to manage them without the assistance of a slip of
paper '

This policy treats student athletes as if they were
children who don’t know enough to attend classes.

Pitt athletes should be treated like the rest of the
students.

If all students are not required to have cards signed, then
athletes should not be subjected to the system, either.

Gorbachev to Win an Oscar?

Over break I heard the most
devastating news since Donald
and Ivana Trump separated.
Mikhail “Don’t Cry for Me
Byelorussia” Gorbachev had to
step down as leader of the Soviet
Union. The shock of this news
didn’t hit me until I realized that
over the past year about five of
my columns were about his antics
in the Soviet Union. In short, my
well of stories has dried up.

Or, more aptly, bro/eenup. But ,

I can’t resist getting in a few more
shots at The Bald One, so here I
‘go. You’ve been warned.

It’s hard ‘to figure out how
Mikhail went from running the
biggest socialist power in the
world to running the McBorscht
machine ‘ at the Moscow
McDonald’s (metaphorically
speaking). You’d think that a guy
who tore down the Berlin Wall
and booked Leonard Bernstein
to play at the demolition would
command a little more respect.

Instead he got upstaged by \

Boris »“Let Me Put Some Salt on
That” Yeltsin, who saved Gorby’s
vacation and then changed the
locks on the presidential
washroom last summer: _

Not that I have anything against
Yeltsin. It takes a brave guy, after
all, to put together a jigsaw puzzle
that takes up more than half of
Asia. I’m sure that, in time, I’ll
have just as mu ch fun lampooning
him as I have had with Gorbachev.
But he has certainly complicated

Adam
Richter
things by changing the initials of
the USSR to CIS. For one thing,
Pitt students all over campus will
probably think that the former
Evil Empire now runs all the

computer labs on campus.

Another thing that Yeltsin failed
to realize is that, since the
Olympics are this year, the Russian
team will need new hockey
uniforms. I hate to say it, but I
don’t think that “CIS” looks as
threatening as “CCCP” when
emblazoned across a hockey
jersey. l

One thing that a lot of people
have wondered is what the heck
Gorbachev is going to do now
that he’s unemployed. Because
of that mandatory five-year
waiting period before initiation
into the Communist Leader Hall
of Fame, the guy is pretty much
all washed up with no place to
go. Being the loyal fan that I am,
I came up with a few job
opportunities for Gorbachev that
he may have missed in the Pravda
classifieds:

~Actor. Ronald Reagan made’

his mark by becoming the first
actor-turned-world leader.
Perhaps Gorbachev can try going
the other direction. Unfortunately,
in Hollywood there isn’t much
demand for bureaucrats with thick

Russian accents. Unless, of course,
someone decides to-make movies
of all of Tom Clancy’s novels.
oProfessor. Again Gorbachev
would be following someone
else’s footsteps (Henry
'Kissinger’s), but someone as
knowledgeable about Soviet
politics should be able to teach
anywhere —— given that anybody
cares enough about the subject
to study it. At this point it’s like
studying Latin, I guess. /

-Democratic presidential
candidate. Oh, never mind. If not
even Cuomo wants it, it can’t be
that great a job, anyway.

Well, maybe I was wrong. I
guess there isn’t much out there
for an ex—Soviet president. The
best we can hope for is that
Gorbachev will try to resist the
temptation to launch a coup of
his own to get back into the
Kremlin. Of course, it’s too late
for that anyway. Like I said, I’ll
bet Boris Yeltsin already changed
the locks on the Kremlin.

Let’s face it: Everyone will just
have to get used to the fact that
the USSR — excuse me, the CIS
— is kinder, gentler .and much
more dull now that Gorbachev
retired. With any luck, this won’t
keep other potential world leaders
from helping me do my job;

Thank God this is an election

Clomficoiiion of rumors not news

The article on “Rumors surrounding blood drives rumor with an article. Andvwhile I'm at it, where

untrue” in the January 8 issue of The Pitt News
caught me by surprise. The day prior to publication

two Greek Week Executive Board
members had told me that The
Pitt News was inquiring about
these “rumors.” My response was,

“The Pitt News staff would not be so irresponsible
as to publish a story about such ridiculous rumors.”
Unfortunately, you have proven me wrong. While
you may have an obligation to inform the public,
I ﬁnd it incredulous that this article was even

Letters

NOT! ‘ ‘

written, let alone that it was printed on above the
fold on page one. I suggest you focus on educating
the publicgon the subject of blood donations and
the AIDS virus without dignifying a quite ignorant

was the article about Pitt beating Penn State in the
Great Pitt—Penn State Blood Challenge last

November?

Please understand that
generally I am very supportive of
your efforts. I will be right there

to defend the freedom of the press, sign your
petitions for obtaining campus police reports,
encourage students to write for the Pitt News, etc.

Shooting
woes /aim‘
women
against
Miami

By Ryan Buncher -
Staf/"W'r1'ter .

The Miami (Fla) women’s
basketball team entered
Saturday’s game against Pitt
ranked 25th in the nation
by AP, having won 11 in a
row. Still, it was the Lady
Panthers’ own bad shooting

‘ that did them in.

“We got the shots that we
wanted. They just weren’t
going in,” said Pitt head
coach Kirk Bruce.

The Hurricane zone left
the Lady Panthers open for
outsideshots all game, but
Pitt hit only 21 of 68 shots
— only 31 percent —— and
five of 24 (21 percent) from
three—point range on the

.way to a 73-54 loss. The

defeat drops Pitt’s record to
5-8 overall, 1-3 in the Big
East.

Early on, Miami ran out
to a 16-9 lead aided by
breakaway layups. Pitt
fought back and tied up the
game at 24 on a three—point
jumper by guard Erin Maloy
with 6:41 left in the first
half.

The Hurricanes regained
the lead on a three-point
play by junior guard Carla
and never
relinquished it. Pitt seemed
to hit a wall offensively,
scoring only four points on
jumpers by sophomore
guard Jill Colabrese and
first—year forward Julie
Fornadel the rest of the
half.

The Lady Panthers went
in to the locker room trailing
40-28.

Another Maloy three-
pointer seemed like it might
get Pitt going again, but the
Lady Panthers didn’t score
again until sophomore
center Carol Miller’s layup
with 17 minutes left and
Miami leading by 19.

“We just hit this point in
the game where we just
don’t score,” Bruce said.

The closest Pitt got after
this drought was 61-47, after
a jumper by forward Jonna
Huemrich and Maloy’s fifth

three—point shot. But the
Hurricanes answered with
consecutive jumpers by
senior guard Jeannie
Herbert to get the lead back
to 18.

Bruce put a lot of the
offensive blame on bad
passing.

“We were rushed,” Bruce

Taking off

Hamilton, Gilbert leaving school for p

By Derek P. Willis
Sports Editor

Keith Hamilton and Sean
Gilbert, junior defensive ends on
Pitt’s football team, announced
yesterday that they would both
forego their remaining collegiate
eligibility and enter the world of
professional football.

Both players cited economic
reasons as the main‘ factors in
their decision.

“This is tough,” Hamilton said,
“but I would like to help [my
mother], brother and little sister.
It is purely an economic decision.”

Hamilton’s father, Willie, died
two years ago.

Gilbert said financial problems
and an uncertain future were the
reasons for his departure.

“I just thought about my options
—— about what was best for me,”
he said.

Both Hamilton and Gilbert said
they would return to Pitt to finish
their degrees in the future.

The two defensive ends have
struggled with injuries during their
collegiate careers. Hamilton was
a Parade All-American at
Heritage High School in
Lynchburg, Va., and a key recruit

-for former Pitt head coach Mike

Gottfried. He led the Panthers in
sacks his first season and was

named Freshman of the Year by
The Sporting News. In his
sophomore year Hamilton started
all 11 games and again led Pitt in
sacks. Last season a hip injury
limited him to nine games, yet he
still managed eight sacks, second

on the club to Ricardo McDonald. ,

Gilbert, from Aliquippa High
School, was the 1988 USA Today
Defensive Player of the Year. He
sat out his first season at Pitt
under academic guidelines. In
1990 Gilbert suffered a knee injury
which allowed him to play in
only six games. He recorded 34
tackles and two sacks.

Last year Gilbert played in all
11 games despite a toe injury
which forced him to miss four

starts. He finished fifth on the

team in tackles and was named
first—team Big EastAll-Conference.

Both players made their
decisions after the 1991 season.
“The decision came after the Penn
State game,” Gilbert said. “I chose

notto think about it until after the '

season was over.”

Hamilton, who has had a
somewhat stormy relationship
with defensive line coach Fred
Von Appen in the past, was quick
to thank both Von Appen and
head coach Paul Hackett for their
positive inﬂuence on him.

“Coach Hackett and Coach Von

offense.
However after Morningstar got
into foul trouble early in the

second half, the Panthers looked‘

to Chris McNeal to pick up the
slack. He responded with 22
points and six rebounds, keying
an 83-72 Pitt victory over the
Friars (8-7 overall; 0-3 Big East).
The win, coupled with a 79-70
Connecticut loss to the Villanova
Wildcats, left the Panthers (3-0)
with the only undefeated record
in conference play and raised
their season mark to 11-4.

While the Panthers never trailed
after the 17:00 mark, they could
not shake a pesky Providence
squad. The Friars cut the Pitt lead
to three, 73-70, after forward
Michael Smith connected on one
of two shots from the charity
stripe.

Point guard Sean Miller then
combined with Morningstar with
2:28 remaining for the basket that
started an 8-0 Panther run. That
assist made Miller the all-time
assist leader in Pitt history.

Miller said. “It came at a key

Three is the magic number that
Sean Miller usually shoots for,
but Saturday night the number
was 617. It was obvious from the

opening seconds of Pitt’s 85-72 _

conquest of the Providence Friars
that it was Miller’s night.

On the first possession of the
ballgame Miller pulled up and
drained a three-pointer from the
left side for a 3-0 Pitt lead, and
that was only the beginning.
Needing eight assists to surpass
Darelle Porter as Pitt’s all-time
assist leader, the fifth-year senior

I from Beaver Falls, Pa., quickly

went to work, feeding Chris
McNeal and Darren Morningstar
on the blocks for four first-half
assists, all the while guiding the
Panthers to a 41-38 lead.

The record assist, number 618,
was as timely as any Miller has
had. A 7-2 Providence spurt left
Pitt up by only three with 3:08
remaining. Following a time out,
the Panthers worked patiently
for the good shot. The record-
setting feed came on a pretty
turnaround jumper by
Morningstar with the shot clock
under five seconds, which gave
Pitt a little room to breathe at 75-
70.

Miller finished with 16 points

and eight assists. He hit all eight
of his free-throw attempts,
including six in the final 1:29, to
help Pitt close the door on this
one. This has been a season of
milestones for Miller, who scored
his 1,000th career point on Dec.
14 at West Virginia. On
Wednesday night, against
Syracuse, he moved into 18th
place on the Panthers’ all—time
scoring list. But Miller said this
was his most satisfying
accomplishment.

“It feels real good. Any point
guard that comes into college
basketball, one of his dreams is
to become the all—time. assist
leader,” Miller said.

‘‘I think he’s had a tremendous
year,” Pitt head coach Paul Evans
said. “I think he thinks the best
part is ahead of him. He’s been a
great person here in the
community; he’s been a class
act.”

Miller quickly credited his
teammates, present and past, for
making the record possible. Miller
said he was fortunate enough to
play with strong post players,
like Charles Smith, Jerome Lane
and Brian Shorter.

“I’ve had a lot of great guys to
pass to,” he said, then quickly
added that this season has been
the most satisfying of his career.

“This is the most fun I’ve ever

had playing basketball,” he said.
“There’s so many unselﬁsh people
on this team. Everyone’s playing
defense; no one’s pouting when
they come out of the game.”
Miller’s knack for making the
big shot or key pass when Pitt
needs it most carried the Panthers
on a night when Providence just
kept hanging around in hopes of
pulling the upset. With Pitt
clinging to a 35-33 lead in the late
stages of the first half, Miller fired
from the top of the key and found
the bottom of the net for three
and a 38-35 lead. After the Friars
crept to within one, Miller used a
nice little baseline drive, then

Steelers was predicted for months;
then all the local news shows
acted as if he had died. Let’s face
it. The timing is right. Noll seemed
to be tiring of the modern game
and players, and the Old ways
don’t work so well anymore.

With the chance to name a new
coach and the upcoming NFL
draft expected to be a very strong
one, this is a crucial Off—season'
for the team. Naming Tom
Donohoe director of football
relations was a good beginning.
He will take on some of the
administrational responsibility,
thus allowing the new coach to
focus his attention to running the
team on the field.

The new coach will most likely

be an NFL assistant, and it should
be a defensive guy. The current
scheme needs to change, and the
best defensive minds available
are looking for head—coaching
jobs. Buddy Ryan would be the
best choice (and he is -very
available now that Tampa Bay
has passed on him and hired Sam
Wyche), but it probably won’t
happen. He just isn’t the kind of
guy the Steelers organization goes
after — even though it should.
His price would also probably be
too high for the tight-fisted
Steelers. Remember: This is the
team with a payroll consistently
near the bottom of the league,
and it has gotten what it paid for

Buncher

Continued from page 10
the past few years.

0 A Joe Greene has been mentioned

quite often as a candidate and

' will probably make a great head

coach someday, but he really
needs more coaching experience.
Two current NFL defensive

. coordinators who would be good

choices are Dave Wannstedt of
Dallas and Vince Tobin of
Chicago.

Former Steeler assistants
George Perles (Michigan State
coach), Bud Carson (Eagles
defensive coordinator) and
Woody Widenhofer (Detroit Lions
assistant) would also fit the bill.
Carson might be the best of the
group, having had NFL head-
coaching. experience with the
Browns. He not only took the
Eagles’ defense from good to
dominant, he did a good job with
mediocre defensive talent in
Cleveland when he was the head
coach there.

The offensive-oriented
candidate list is limited. San
Francisco offensive coordinator

' ‘Paul Holmgren, the best of the

bunch, took the Green Bay job.
The team recently interviewed
Oiler offensive coordinator Kevin
Gilbride, but he wouldn’t even
be able to bring the run-and-
shoot to Pittsburgh.

The Steelers haven’t been able
to find two good receivers since
John Stallworth retired, so
deploying four on each play isn’t
such a good idea.

Having the best set of tight
ends in the league (Eric Green,
Adrian Cooper and Keith Cash)
and bringing in a coach whose
offense doesn't use tight ends is
the kind of logic that has kept the
team out of the playoffs five of
the last six seasons.

Another reason to choose a
defensive guy is the fact that two
quality offensive coaches who
were recently fired as head
coaches, Lindy Infante (Packers)
and Dan Henning (Chargers),
might take positions as offensive
coordinators.

Henning deﬁnitely won’t get
another head-coaching job any
time soon, after failures in San
Diego and Atlanta. His system,

which uses one running back,
one tight end and an H—back
(hybrid running back and tight
end) would fit the Steelers well,
since tight end is such a strong
point.

It was simple enough that it
could work. When he was
offensive coordinator in
Washington, the team kept
switching quarterbacks. That
could be the situation in Pittsburgh
next season, as Bubby Brister
and Neil O’Donnell battle for the
No. 1-quarterback job.

All this assumes that defensive
coordinator Dave Brazile and
offensive coordinatorjoe Walton
will be fired when a new coach is
hired — maybe sooner. They
should be.

The team gave Walton another
year to prove his system, and it
seemed to get even worse. Brazile
stubbornly sticks to a read-and-
react, 5-4 defense even though
the talent on defense is much
better suited to an attacking 4-3
defense — much like the ones
used by the defensive gurus
mentioned above.

Worse yet, the top two
defenders on the team in ’91,
linebackers Greg Lloyd (a Pro-
Bowl alternate finally getting his
due) and Jerrol Williams, were
rarely on the field together.
Williams never did get a chance
to start and still led the team with
nine sacks.

The ﬁnal stage is to have a

strong draft. This is expected to
be a very strong year for talent,
and the Steelers in the 11th spot
have the highest pick since 1987,
when they came up with All-Pro
cornerback Rod Woodson. They
also came up with Thomas
Everett, Lloyd, linebacker Hardy
Nickerson and running back
Merril Hoge in that draft. Similar
success this time around is a
must. 2 . ,
Priority No. 1 is a receiver, with
the team having a good shot at
Desmond‘ Howard or Carl
Pickens. Offensive line should
be next, getting the best guard
available in round two.

If the team goes to a 4-3 defense,
defensive tackle is also an
important position, since the

Steelers only have two, Gerald
Williams and Craig Veasey, on
the roster. Pitt defensive tackle
Sean Gilbert, who declared his
intentions to go pro yesterday,
and Florida State quarterback
Casey Weldon would be good
choices in the second round.

If the team does do well next
season, Noll’s critics will say he
should have left long ago. In
truth, he has kept the team

_ competitive despite a lack of talent

since the players from the Super
Bowl teams began to retire. The
Steelers haven’t made trades. They
have kept key players out of the
lineup this season due to
holdouts, such as David Little,
Rod Woodson, Jeff Graham and
Ernie Mills. "

They have done very little in
the Plan—B, free—agent market,
which has been useful to some of
the best teams in_the league the
last few years. If Donohoe and
the team’s higher-ups refuse to
supply the funds to win, the team
with the league’s lowest payroll
will get exactly what it pays for:
a loser.

specifically about wherehe felt
he would be drafted in April’s
National Football League draft,
but Hamilton set his goal as being
a fIrst—round choice. “I have to be
in the best shape I can be in,”
Hamilton said.

Hackett, a former NFL assistant
coach, said he expected both
Hamilton and Gilbert to be drafted
high. “There is a lot ofuncertainty
as to the direction NFL salaries
are going,” he said. “Maybe this is
the right time for them. They’ll be
under the microscope, if you will,
andl think they are both prepared
for that. I think they both
understand that some of the
greatest competition they’ve ever
had in their lives will be in the
next few months.”

Gilbert stressed the role of
Hackett and Von Appen in his
career at Pitt. “When I came here,
my attitude was completely
different than it is now,” he said.
“I didn’t stress academics, and
Coach Hackettbrought academics
into the program. And I thank
Coach Von Appen for
understanding, for not turning
his backoon me.

“A program like this is on the
rise,” Gilbert said. “It would have
been easy for Keith to leave when
Coach Hackett came in, but he
showed how’ much of a man he
was and stayed.”

“I know that I’ve been a center
of turmoil since I’ve been here,”
Hamilton said, “but I do have a

fondness [for] Pitt and for Coach I

Hackettwand Coach Von Appen.”

Pitt ’has had 17 defensive
linemen drafted by the NFL since
1978, including six ﬁrst-round
choices. Burt Grossman, who was
picked by the San Diego Chargers
in 1989, was the last Panther first-
rounder. In the past two years,
Marc Spindler, Tom Sims and
Mark Gunn have all been picked,
and Tom Siragusa signed as a free
agent with Indianapolis.

“I can’t wait for the future,”

Gilbert said, “and I try not to look ’

at it in a negative way even though
it puts a dent in my heart toleave

posed even more problems for the Friars’ defense. Miller and

drew fouls, blowing past Providence pointman Ira Bowman on-
several occasions. Miller looked to McNeal for a smooth jumper
from the corner, which built Pitt’s lead to six points with under
14 minutes to play. » .

“He knows when to hit you with the ball; that’s the best thing
about playing with him,” McNeal said. “I’m just-glad he’s around-
for this year so Jerry can learn from him.”

“We felt we could dominate the guard play with ou_r

on the kick-out.’’ ,

Miller played 35 minutes and lended the calming influence
Pitt needed for its poised stretch run: an intangible that did not.
go unnoticed by Providence. .

“IPittI has a point guard that, when it comes down to the last
two or three minutes of the game, is the best in the league,”
Providence Coach Rick Barnes said. “There’s no one better than
him in the league. My hat goes off to Sean Miller. I'm just really
impressed with him. I remember coming in  three or four
years ago with [Carlton] Screen and IEricl Murdock giving him
fits; now he’s the guy giving everybody fits. Coming down in
the last two minutes, there’s no one in the league — maybe no
one in the country\— better.”

“Pitt showed a lot of poise. Sean Miller did an excellent job
of running the team,” Friar forward Marques Bragg said.
“Everybody plays their role to achieve on that team.”

“Sean Miller keeps the team under control. He’s the leader of
the team. He tells them what to do, and they listen. They follow
his lead,” forward Michael Smith said.

Bernard-

Continued from page 4
Television shows and
commercials suggest that people
only want sordid physical
attractions.

‘That’s not true, but parents
need to educate their children
about the virtues of caring and
love.

PN: What is the PSH’s stand
on gun control, drug use, or
abortion rights? _

VB: On those issues, we tend
to be rampant individualists. We
have discussions about these
issues so people can make
decisions for themselves. We are
not monolithic by any means.

PN: What are your hopes for
the future?

VB: That people will accept
each other no matter what they
believe or do not believe. It
shouldn’t be too much to ask.

Humanists have been in
America during the past 200 years.
Two of our most beloved
presidents were humanists.

The first was Thomas Jefferson,
who was a deist and not a
Christian.

You can go to the bookstore
and find the “Jefferson. bible” in
which he took the New Testament
and stripped out all the miracles,
which he considered myths, and

.focused on what he considered

most important: the moral
teachings of a man called Jesus.

The second president was
Abraham Lincoln. On the
testimony of his wife, law partner
and son, Lincoln did not believe
in the Christian faith. Yet he is still
considered a great man.
So humanism has been around
for awhile.
PN: Who can join PSH?
VB: We meet at [Carnegie Mellon
University].

All interested Pitt students are
welcome to attend.
