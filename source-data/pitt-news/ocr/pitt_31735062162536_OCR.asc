Educator’s Report A

Dire Warning to Pa.

The number of students who will seek to enter Pennsyl-
vania colleges and universities in 1970 will be double or

more than double the number

who actually enrolled in 1958.

This huge “enrollrnent bulge” will create unprecendented
ﬁnancial problems for Commonwealth institu_tions of higher
learning. However, if various reforms are introduc.ed,the

total expenditure can be reduced.

without impairing the quality of
educational processes.

These are among the. conclu-
sions contained in a detailed
analysis of."‘Higher Education in
published" last week.
Thereport was made by a panel
of six educators and businessmen.
Chairman of the group was Chan-
cellor Litchﬁeld.

. State Ranks Last
The report was not encourag-
ing about the situation of Penn-

" sylvania as compared with other

states. “Pennsylvania,” the report

J warned, “ranks last in the amount

of classroom, laboratory, library
and dormitory space available to

‘educate and house more students

in its colleges and universities.

In“ addition, it’ is near the bot-
tom with respect to the annual‘
income per student these insti-
tutions require to maintain and
expand their programs.”

The price of correcting these
deﬁciencies will be a large one. To
meet the increased enrollment the
state would have to double its
physical ‘facilities, and face an in.-
crease ot almost 200 per cent in
annual operating expenses.

Need 20,000 Faculty

“Other crucial shortages,” the
Chancellor stated in a press con-
ference on the report, “are faced
in the 20,000 faculty member deﬁ-
cit,,with.little prospect of getting
more than half that number, and
the other -majorarea of shortage
in the needed books. About six
million. new volumes are neede,d,r
plus space and librarians for
them.” '

"In this respect we are far
behind the USSR.” Litchiield
continued. “with that country-
is, of course, another ‘problem
facing us.”

The magnitude of the crisis de-
mands a fundamental reappraisal
of the system of higher education

Rhodes Offers
Scholarships For

5 Male G 'aduates

Applications are now being ac-
cepted for the Rhodes Scholar-
ships. These awards make it pos-
sible for a student to spend "two or
three years at Oxford University.
Only male college graduates may
apply. These are highly competi-
tive awards, only 32 of which are
assigned to the United States.

Each candidate must secure
endorsement of his own institu-‘
tional Rhodes Scholarship Com-
mittee. If the student is suc-
cessful in receiving the endorse-
ment of his college or university,
his application is forwarded
either to the state in which he
resides or the state in" which he
has received two years of his
college education.

Further information and appli-
cation forms can be received from
the Committee Chairman, Dr. Roy
Heath, in Room 205, SU.' Appli-
cations must be returned to the
Committee by noon, Oct. 30.

by each of the elements of the
system faculties, administra-
tions, parents, students, alumni,
business, secondary schools, and
government.‘ “All of these groups,’?
the- report continues, “must be
prepared to reexamine and, if
necessary, rebuild the basic‘ struc-
ture.” ‘

Counsel Students

"We are suggesting something
that is far-reaching for each
group,” the chancellor reported.
“In the right schools the most
necessary task is the counseling of
these students going on to college
and the sitting out of incompe-
tent people.

“The parents ought to be will-
ing to assume the financial bur-
den of their children’s educa-
tion. Students absolutely unable
to ﬁnance their schooling should
be provided with scholarships.

“This money _can be obtained
from the contributions of alumni,
who are. not presently assuming
their share of the burden, and
other , groups. Industry possesses
the tendency for contributing but
this is absent in many other areas.

’“S‘tuAdent responsibility will be
to learn to -' work harder and
earlier. The colleges and universi-
ties themselves must Amake ade-
quate use ot their facilities, and
the Commonwealth must ‘increase
its support of them.

“Much of theﬁnancial increase
will, of nece‘ssit_3’. be bourne by
‘the students}? .

two men, feeling that their plan
was the only possible plan that
could be considered, began to
heckle the other representatives

own point of view.

David Menzer, Arts ’62, placed
before the most original _plan

three reasons for not continuing

made the following-- comments.
“Of course,
I can’t be pleased with the attend-

ance this evening. I can only feel,

that\50 of the more interested
‘members of the student body did
attend."

“If there were only three peo-
ple who could visualize ‘a con-
tinuance of Spring Carnival in
its present. form, I think it's a
pretty" clear indication that
Spring Carnival will be dropped.
or radically clianged."

“The proceedings of tonight's
meeting will serve as the basis on
which SGA shall progress in ref-
erence to Spring Carnival." I

Strange Belm vior Needed

‘.Many empty spaces will appear on the ballotsfor Wed-
nesday’s elections "for 24 ‘class Cabinet officers. Actually a
total of 25 students are running for these posts.’ But for
only four of these Cabinets are there enough candidates:

0 - and of these four, two of them have only four persons vy-

ing for four positions. _
Also to be elected are two freshman representatives

—V and one sophomore for SGA. Finally, an amendment to the

SGA Constitution is on the ballot.

-;' C 7 Fall elections usually draw a small vote, and this fall

appears to be no exception. Last year 781 students voted.

V’ - At that time two political parties competed forpositions.

On Wednesday only ‘one party will be represented on the

V ballot, thus giving us reason to believe ‘an even smaller
, vote than last year will be recorded.

But perhaps someyof the nearly 7,000 students in th

' ‘a university will behave strangely this time and vote for their

representatives in student government.

Success at Midday

The Midday Series has covered a vast amount of ground
since its inception near the end of the 1957-58 school year,

In bringing many outstanding programs here, the Series .

has ﬁlled a great void in the university’s educational cur-
F

The ﬁrst two programs this .year have been-, in a way,
surprising. Bennett Cerf, the humorist and television star,
was greeted by a huge crowd which overﬁowed into the
Supper Room and into the hallway. Following Cerf was
Kimon Friar, noted for his translation of the sequel to “the
Odyssey.” Although Friar didn’t draw as large a crowd as

Cerf‘, he still managed to create a standing-room-only situa-

tion in the Ballroom. M
These two capacity crowds, needless to say, were grat-

' ifying to those persons who have worked with the Midday

Series. The'atten.dance also was gratifying. to‘ us because
the members of the university ﬁnally are taking advantage
of these events. _

The other programs scheduled for this year offer a wide
variety of personalties. The oft used phrase, “Something for
everybody,” is the best way to describe these noon prograrris,

except that we might insert the word “good” after _“some- ‘
thing.”

Beethoven vs. Elections .' . .

Pro-Union Calendar

By Murray Chass
Mozart and Beethoven versus student elections.
That’s the main attraction for Wednesday at noon
in the Student Union. ‘

This unusual battle has been dreamed up jointly
by the Student "Union administration and the
Calendar Subcommittee of the
Student Affairs Committee.

By way of explanation, which
this affair deserves, Mozart and
Beethoven are a couple of
gentlemen whose fmusic will be
presented by members of /the
Pittsburgh , Symphony’ Orchestra
as "a Midday" Series program
Wednesday atinoon in the Union
Ballroom. . ‘ :’

Wedriesday_‘-a'lso is -‘the day
that students will ‘fgo to the
polls” to_Vvote.- ‘ .

In a list ,_of eventsvapproved by the‘Calendar

a

‘Subcommittee, "two major ones were‘ scheduled for

Wednesday. One was the Middayseries; the other,
Fall elections. However,‘ a note accompanied the
listing of the elections. It said: “Committee sug-
gests Monday (Oct.) 5 or_Monday *(Oct.) 12 ,in_—

stead of Wednesday (Oct.) 7, in order 'not- to dis-

turb Midday Series program in Ballroom during’
noon hour.” 0

Plot Thickens , _

I The committee then was advised it was ‘com-
mitting anierror in proposing this change. Wed-

nesdays, itewas offered has been proved to" be the A
.best day for student elections.

Monday, on the
other hand, is a" very poor day-

Perhaps, it was suggested to the committee, the
Midday Series for that ‘day should be cancelled if
it were feared the elections would disturb the pro-
gram too greatly. ‘ --

Cancelling the program was not feasible, though,

because the, Symphony program had alreadyvbeen _

arranged. So with some further talking by repre-

sentatives of SGA the elections for Oct. 7.were

approved. ' . .
The story, however, doesn’t end there". The

Student Union administration told SGA‘i't could not.

use the regular spot. for a polling place but instead

could use a smaller section across the way’. The.~
"usual spot is in the foyer to the rightlof the.F_ifth

Avenue entrance as one walks in that door.

‘Sitting on the‘ m‘ig‘i_n the hall of fourth ﬂoor‘

Schenley Hall conversing with some ‘of my f_riends
the other day. (rugsare nice to think on somehow)
it suddenly occurred to me that college students
are different from Other People. ' I mentioned this
casually to the Circle. They pondered it awhile but

couldn't come up with much I
in «the way of a reason for this
Striking Phenomenon.

The manifestations of it are
manifold, however. Being, of
course, the leader of the Group,
I sent most of them out re-

left of that entrance adjacent to the Student Union
desk. -
Usefulness Out-lived? .

The Student Union originally was selected as a
spot for elections because of the much larger vote
that can beadded there.’ However, one begins to
doubt the advantage of the Union when the Union
administration decides student elections are of such .'
little importance that it makes no difference what
is done with them. '

Returning to the conflict between the election
and the program of chamber music, the Calendar
Subcommittee’-s suggestion to, change the date for.
theelections creates some doubt about this Sub- 1
committee. I"ts,purpose’is:stated as follows;

“Regulate the student events calendarby acting _
upon requests fo_r.approval of specific» events and’
the’ omciai calendar of
approved’ events”, — -e ’ .

Unless we are’ grossly‘ pmistaken, we. detectan
attitude slightly pro—Student Union‘ on this sub-
committee. First of" all, the chairman of the group
is William Cooper, director of “the Student Union.

Last year’s chairman was Dr. William Swartz-~

H’

baugh, who then was both dean of students and di-- 

rector of the‘ student. union. — -

‘The list of eventsisent to presidents,
visers of organizations this surnmenwas signed by
Sally Sharples, who'was'listed as “Program. Con-
sultant -—- Student'Union, for" the Calendar Sub- .
committee, Student Affairs Committee.” Miss-
Sharples also was assistant to the director of the a
Student Union while here. A

More and more university activities have been
brought to the Union eachyear since it was‘ trans-
formed into facilities for student use. There is
nothing" wrong with the Union administration’s
exercising jurisdiction‘ over Union-sponsored ac-
tivities‘. A _‘

But when the director of V, the union is made;
chairman of the calendar subcommittee, the'_body

f which does hold jurisdiction over all majorevents,
\ this, we feel, is out of line; '

-Is the._job of approving dates for events so'diﬁ"1-
cult that a strictly student committee could not
handle it‘? It seems. doubtful that it _would be." _Pe'r'-i
haps with a‘ student-run commit-tee, such so-called

"one girl used, two hands instead’ of one’ and ‘the

“I0 also talked -to some people’ concerned over

if College Students can. Control their Imaginations.”

She paused,/reﬂectively. “Oh well,” she said
saunteririg off, “in 80 years we’ll all be dead.”

Kimon Friar Speaks E ~
‘On ‘American Myth’

By KATHRYN GRANT .

Kimon Friar, writer, educator and critic, spoke last Wed-
nesday in the ..Union on the subject of the “American Myth”
using Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, and William Inge
as three ﬁgures of his subject.

_ Allegheny County Schools.

The alumnus of the University of Michigan pointed out

that no one can define the American ‘Myth for it is now being

formed. He stated however, “the
American Myth fascinates me as
does the Greek myth.”

Friar, translator of “The Odes-

sey.,,”'._into poetic English, pointed -I;

out that when an artist has to

stop to create-symbols he becomes

a “critic as well. Such symbols
should be a part of the society.
-“Artists,” he stated, “are often
held responsible for" what the
- civilizations are responsible.”
Poem Like Onion
,A prediction.f1'om Friar ‘was
that’ the poetic drama .vill be that
which will penetrate the Ameri-

Jxcan . drama. He declared‘ that

Arthur—Miller and Tennessee Wil-
liams are both basically poets.
“Prose can only tell you .what
goes on. outside,owhereas poetry
can show you what goes on in-
side,” Friar observed.

At the coffee hour he said, “A
poem is like an onion. It can
be read at many layers and
copious tears may be spread at
the readings.”

Another point made at the lec-

v;:p- ture was the concept that Ameri-

cans attempt to make everything
similar and_ allow the individuals
to erupt. Williams, Miller and
Inge use American’. symbols to
emphasize these eruptions.

Friar ended the. lecture by/_say-
*ing, “All artists always are and
always will be misﬁts.”

Will ‘Write Poem .
During the coﬁee hour, the
speaker announcedhis intention
.of writing a political, psycho-
logical poem showing the ‘cap-

 ability of man. _to become any-

thing ‘he conceives himself of "
becoming. "

After the ‘Greeli myths. are no.
longer used, the Christ_ian_ myths‘

will becomefthe subjects of trag-
edies such as “J.B.” Following
this, Friar believes that men shall

be his own hero and not the pup—'

pet. of the supernatural. This will
be possible because life is ‘basic.-
ally tragic.‘ - ‘ .
Friar ended his appearance .
with this philosophy of. life. In
essence he said he lovks onjlifc

 Booters Win Twice;
Lack Potent Scoring

1':

Well, the Panther

By JACK SMITH
booters under coach Leo Bemis have

won two soccer gameswithin the last week, but as yet Bemis
still can’t tell if his team possess a strong scoring punch.
/’ In a game with'Slippery Rock the Cats won three to one‘.

Simeon Pestich, Bob. Murdoch

and Bob McNulty each tallied

one, with all three assists coming on passes from Ed.Giraldo.

E Harriers Beat

Week Ohio U. P
lT7ith. Shut-out

_ ‘ ny-DAVE LAVINE ,
The ‘Panther Harriers com-
pletely over-powered Ohio U.,

defeating them‘, by a 15-407

score_ The —victory_ evened up
the Cat’s record at 1-1.
Taking 'the"individuals hon-
orsi for the second consecutive
week, Bush won quite easilyand
wasnnever headed. Rush negoti-
ated the 4.3_ mile Schenley Park
course in 23 minutes and 35 sec-
onds. ‘ - ‘ _-
.Following Rush were Bob Stuck,

' _Bil1 Hinchberger, Reed Clarke and
1 Mickey. J upina, all of »_ whom

.crossed the ﬁnish line ahead of the
best runner from. Ohio U.
In taking the ﬁrst: ﬁve places
the Panthers scored a shut-out.
' Runners in a cross-country meet
are awarded. points equal to
their places, that_is if a player
ﬁnished ‘first he would get one

. - point. 4
If a runner would ﬁnish‘ second‘

hewould, get twopoints. Inevery
-‘meet the’ team" with the lowest
-score wins._ .

There are ‘seven participants
from each team and twelve places
in the meet.

The ‘first ﬁve runners from h

each ' squad are. the only ones
that/_ count in‘ the scoring‘. . That
is why the Cats score“ was only
15 in the contest Saturday. 4
However, the sixth and seventh
runners, although they can’t score
points, can help to push, the op-
ponents score up._ ' .
Since‘ there are twelve places,
the_ sixth and seventh men on a

_ team, _by ﬁnishing ahead of the

other team’s ﬁrst ﬁve, can make
the opponent’s score :.s high“ as 50.

° The Blue and Gold then trav-

eled to Ohio University where
theywwong 2-1. In the first minute
of the fourth quarter Pete Kara,-
vel" headeda ball in on a pass
from Murdoch.
Won in Overtime

‘With the score being tied at the
end of regulation play, the.Pan-
‘thers. had to go‘ ;_.into two over-
times before DonfJerich scored on
a slow 20? yard shot. The assist

‘against came’ from Murdoch.

7 With two‘ games (completed

the Cats have tallied five goals

and with no one player hitting
- for more than one, Bemis is still
_ pondering the offensive «ques-
' tion. »

So far the defense looks as ‘

strong -as was anticipated, with

‘George Zanicopoulos and co—cap- -
‘tains Ron Wyatt and Ron: Pod-

milsak leading the way. Cal Smith

has continued to show improve’-

inent at the halfback spot. '
_.“These players have been stand-

«outs on. defense,” said Bemis.‘ “We

are counting on the defense, since
the» offense hasn’t been sharp, to
keep us in the game.” .

' Take Many Shots

The Cat oﬁense in the game.
_with Ohio U. had 34; shots at goals,

while Ohio U. only had 13. The
Panthers will'have' to captilize on
these opportunities if they are to
continue their winning ways.
The freshmen won their ‘first’
game of the season downing
:‘Shadyside,» ‘a. team‘ the frosh
have‘nev_er beaten. 2-1. Shooting '
"the twogoals for‘ the frosh were
Corky ‘ Cuthbert and Nick
‘Marino. ' , '
. “Wes havea good team,” said

yfrosh "coach Dick Kipp. “If most -

of the fellows get into shape we
will be -hard -to beat.”‘ Gerry

Yospin, Gil McDonald and‘ goalie '

Herb Browning were sighted‘ by
Kipp as outstanding inthe Shady-
side victory.

him intoga tie with Haggerty for

Why do men and women who think for
themselves usually smoke Viceroy? Be-
cause they've found out the Viceroy ﬁlter

land game. The associated press
are reported as saying WI-IAT!,
while the local ‘papers seemed to
think it was a kink of desert.
Rumor has it that both teams
refuseclto play for fear of knock-
ing each other out of National
ranking. The truth of the matter
is that the Philander—Smith—Leland

game is -still being played. The-

game was delayed when each team
refused to call the toss of the coin.
Please report the ﬁnal score to one
