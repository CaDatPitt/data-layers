Service,

One store polled this year re-
ported that they 'had moved to

a new address two months be-
fore last year’s lists were ids-
tributed but the old address was
given on the card.

Another mistake was made in
the listing of the wrong branch of
a cleaning establishment. A Squir-
rel Hill store was recorded as a
participant, but the poll showed
that the Oakland‘ branch of the
same cleaners was offering the cut’-
rates while the other store was
never a member of the service.

Numerous errors in the names
of stores were discovered, includ-
ing the naming of an_éOak1and

Store owners invariably re-
ported their disappointment in

student response to the service.
One store out of the twelve
polled reported fair response.
i'1‘his, however, came from. Tech
and Duquesne who, along, with
Pitt, Mt. Mercy and Chatham
College, are co—sponsors of the
program. Buying at cut-,-rates by
‘Pitt students was indicated as
“very poor.”

As a remedy for the lack of
publicity, the store owners recom-
mended that ntoices be posted on
the school bulletin boards adver-
-tising the program. No such no-
tices now hang on theiboards at

 decides what colors

 T G-Ex reflector lamps 

Which color of light makes people look nat-
ural? Should a blue light be used more often
than a red? What kind of effect does a violet
light have on merchandise?
In recent years, color lighting has become ‘

‘ r so important in stores, restaurants, theaters,

and displays that General Electric developed
"a line of new easy.-to-use color-reflector lamps
3 for this market. ,
‘The man responsible for deciding which
— colors are most effective for users of these.
lamps is 29-year-old Charles N. Clark, Ap-
plication Engineering Color - ‘Specialist for
General Electric’s large lamp department.

Work ls Interesting, Important C

In a recent series of tests, Clark made a
critical appraisal of literally hundreds of

, ' color-ﬁlter materials to ﬁnd the ones that
produced maximum results but were still

* ‘suitable to high-production techniques, prac-
tical stocking and simpliﬁed selling. This
experimental work also had to take into

‘ account all the information on human per-
ception of color. '

 25,000 college Graduates at General Electric

When- Clark came to General Electric in
V _ 1949, he already knew the work he wanted
 r to do. Like each of the 25,000 college-grad-
uate employees, /he was given his chance to
grow and realize his full potential. For Gen-
eral Electric has long believed this:, When
‘fresh, young minds are given freedom to/,-
make progress, everybody beneﬁts—the in-
dividual,» the company, and the country.

     

CHARLES N. CLARK joined CE. in 1949
after receiving his B.S. and M.S.
(in E.E.) fromi the University of

“BETTER JUST SMILE AND SAY 'HELLO'.’’ ,

T501‘ It Across '

Money is important; in effect, it is a result of ac-

 

complishment. But at this University, as in most educational

institutions, ideals are stressed to_create a more humane
society which will eventually provide all people with both

‘the means and the manners to live comfortably. For this

reason, proﬁt becomes a, secondary goal. '
Late last Wednesday,‘ indications pointed to the fact

that the current Campus Chest drive will be the most

‘ successful ever conducted—-both funds’ andpledges seemed
_ heavy. "

But Clarence Kylander, chairman, eschewed an aspect
ofthe drive which he though to be more important and
more successful. than the jingling "coins. “I'think we’ve got
it across.” he stated in the quiet, logical manner in which
the whole campaignﬂhas been conducted. ' ' ‘ V

‘Kylander. referred to’ ‘the congenial reception given
collectors and the program as a whole. From outward mani-
festations, at least, the student body appeared willingjto
contribute. It was as though they really realized the worthy
organizations for which funds - are intended and the more
important aspects of Charity. It is more than shelling out
cash. It is more than sympathy for those who are not as
fortunate as the contributors. Even the slogan, “From those
who have to those who need” hardly implies the true mean-
ing of Charity. _ V ‘

But when one realizes‘ that Bible translators ﬁnd both
words, “Charity” and Righteousness”, synonmous, he can
best realize theimplications ofjdonation; Testament law»re-
quired that farmers leave one corner of a ﬁeld unharvested
as the rightful property of the indigent. Morally, the corner
didn’tIbelong to the planter, but rather served him a respon-
sibility of meeting community needs. '

ThaCampus Chest committee has set such a pace for

the student body. Men and women have shown maturityrby «

readily accepting such standards. Every one is pleased with

a campaign that lacks high-pressure tactics, sensational‘-pub-

licity, over-emphasis of extrinsic motivation. A
What is more important than anything else, Pitt people

are realizing through education how and why they contri-

bute. Congratulations.

« One idea that has gained much favor in C. D.

wonder about this for a few reasons.

First, anyone who has tried to get out~of a

Grid Fortunes
Hit High Mark

By GENE AROMATORIO

  

Sports Editor

    

Footballs may take-funny bounces but football teams
and players take funnier ones. Only a Pitt fan would 00.11-
cede that the Panthers even had a chance betore last Satur-
’day’s game with West Virginia’s giant Mountaineers. I
. -'-It only took acou-ple of hours,ethough, for-the -Pitt grid-
ders to prove how dead Wrong the experts canbe. Even
thosewho felt.’ that the Panthers would. upset. the Mounties
didn’t think that they would tear them apart 1n_the process.
I ' Probably no bowl-bound, nationally-ranked team
has ever taken a worse beating.’ The 26-7 score isn’t really
~ ‘ indicativeof-how bad the -Mounties were 'mau"led.
,-In the Mounties, the Panthers came up against probably

in the. Biggest-and-toughest team in the country———the ‘leading I

offensive team in the nation; Wyant, one of the leading
A_pa_“ssers; Moss and Marconi, leading ru_nners; All-American nominees
Bosley and Huff. . p ‘ - , ’ '
T Funny, this didn’t.seem to bother the Panthers. When John
. . Paluck was chasing, “Bu1l”,Wyant “behind ‘the line, of scrimmage,
Wyant’s press notices didn’t seem to bother “Buffalo” John. He
merely brushed off Wyant’s stiffarrn and promptly ran him off the ﬁeld
andpver the .TWest Virginia" bench for a ten-yard loss. ‘

 We attauchvthe “Buffalo” monicker onto Paluck for a good

reason. Son_1feone;recently ‘asked if a bull. and buffalo had ever
" fought‘ each’ other in a bull- ring and if so .who won. Well, it

seems that there have been two suchﬁghts held‘. ’

‘/Ih both ﬁghts,’ the bull madly charged" head-on at the huge
butraio, crashed._into hirn__and fell dead. The buffalo didn’t even
lose his ‘balance. ‘This maybe gives you some idea of how Wya-nt

. felt Saturday 'afte’rnoon“4when “Buffalo” Paluck took after him.
;_ The 1*unning_:.‘prowess and phenomenal passing record that the
7 Mounties had compiled over their first six games wasn’t too evident
riSa,turday.- " Only four completions in 23 tries.‘/‘As for running, the
Mounties did a lot of that. In fact, they were all but run out of
the Stadium by the Pitt line. ._ 3 '

The " way the Panthers man-handled“ the bigger Mountie
gridders. was really something to see. It was probably. the best
game ,.tl_1e Panthers played all year and was surely-the sweetest

j (win they’ve had. ‘ 

. As a unit, John Miche1osen’s gridders looked’ better Saturday
than.in any game this year. From our vantage point the whole» team
seemed to act as one. Theyxworked together "with more zest and
spirit than they’ve shown all year. Not ‘that spirit has been lack-
in_g,Abut who can blame the Panthers for being more ﬁred up than
-usual for the Mountainmen.

The gamewas the high point of. the season for both teams;
especially ,West Virginia. But by the game's’ end, the Mounties were
about as low as the chalk lines on the -ﬁeld.

' Pappy Lewis’ gridders had come there carrying Alligator
jiope chests and dreaming sugared dreams; Of course, they, hadn’t‘
eally ﬁgured that"the.Panthers‘ might sour their plans and bot-

row their ’Gator ’cases. .. p .
A The Mounties had been getting ready for this game since they
were beaten last year at Morgantown. In tuning up, they ﬂattened
‘such spar—mates as -Virginia Military Institute, George Washington,

5’ Richmond, etc., While the Panthers‘ were taking on teams like Okla-
homa, Navy, Duke,‘ and Miami.

With the Mounties rolling up the wins and records, getting
the National limelight and bowl ﬂirtations, the 1 Panthers had to
merely be content to"si_t back and try to. win some games against the
toughest teams in the nation. _

-' "Finally, both ‘teams ‘were. turned ‘loose against each otheruto

5% W110 was what and why. The result: Pitt football has

'>, soared to it’s highest point in decades._

 Proposal Suggests
-Election . Change  

_ By AL -DONALSON
I 7 Members of the Constitution Committee of Men’s Council
V :are_ scheduled to meet the MC Executive Committee to-
- morrow to present a proposal to change the method in which
the ﬁve members-at-large are elected to Council.

Currently, two representatives from The College, two
representatives from the Schools of Engineering and Mines,
 and‘ one from the School of’ Business Administration con-

     

 

For the ﬁrst time, the Pitt
News will conduct a major sub-
scription campaign to send bi-
weekly issues to University alum-
ni. Because 14 editions have al-
ready been printed, a special rate
"of two dollars has been established
for remaining 38 editions. In spe-
cial cases, back copies will be sent
to alunmi.

MC. ' .
_ At the MC meeting last Wed-
".nesd'ay* afternoon, President Di-

' believed if the members-at-large
3were elected by popular vote
‘from the entire University, MC
would be in a. position to operate
_more eiﬁciently.
,. “If there are four interested and
'-willing men .' from the College ‘or
any other school who could be
"elected to a seat in (Council, I
think it would be good for them
to be elected,” said Petro.
.-‘»‘Men’s Council can be improved
.and can serve a useful purpose at
'Pitt,?’ Petro continued, “and one
 ‘way to accomplish this is. to change
some parts of the Constitution.”
.1 . Petfo also said that he Execu-
tive Committee is considering to
3‘purpose that Council raise the
scholastic requirements for seat-
ing in MC. “Our present mini-
mum average is a 1.2 which is

‘ Carrying forward a great tradition of American

organizations has ushered in anew era in commercial
transportation. Between December 1958 and January
1961, Pan American World Airways, who pioneered
(trans-oceanic air travel with Pratt & Whitney Aircraft
piston engines, will put into passenger service twenty
Boeing 707 and twenty-ﬁve Douglas. DC-8 jet trans-
ports. This ‘ﬂeet of airliners will be powered by twin-
.s4pool,‘axial-ﬂow jet engines, designed and developed by
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft. \ '

Boeing 707 Stratollner
has already established a. trans-
. continental round-trip record.
Powered by four P&WA J -57
engines, it flew from Seattle to ,
Washington, D.C. and back, in 8
hours and 6 minutes — an
average speed of 581 mph.

Douglas nc-a_ ﬂipper is the
latest in a long line of famous ‘
transports. Cruising at 575 mph.,
30,000 feet above the earth, it will
set new standards in speed and

Supernatural

By BARBARA CHERINGTON 5

A discussion which began
on the subject
naturalism Necessary for Re-
ligion” turned into a dis-
cussion of two aspects of

. supernaturalism after participants

agreed it was necessary. .
iLed‘by Dr. Arthur; Kannwischer,
philosophy professor, and Chaplain
George Parker of Chatham Col-
lege, formerly Pennsylvania Col-
lege for Women, the occasion was
sponsored by Council of Scholastic
Organizations, on Nov. 9.
Man Made Ideals
To Dr. Kannwischer, supernat-
uralism is an ideal state man cre-
.ates to perfect what he already
knows. “We don’t look for reli-
gion, the professor claimed, “but
at‘it.”
" This Dr.__,: Kannwischer ex-
plained as being like man’s see-

ing the_ arc‘of a circle and im- "

agining its completeness.
Reverend Parker’s idea of su-

-apernaturalism is an “inﬁnite de-
' pendence.” The chaplain said that

one who understands the mean-
ing ‘of supernaturalism doesn’t
need to ask what it is. I
Need. for Mind
Both speakers“ agreed that
there can be supernaturalism,
or‘ God, without the. human
mind; But they also agreed that
only by the existence of man’s
mind is God understood.or even
intelligible. '
The profe$or and the chaplain
claimed/chat God is seen through

, individual instances.

I

These instances have different
meanings for each person. Dr.
Kannwischer said these, in-,
stances can be found in real life
to explain supernatural Ways.

. ‘The chaplain said supernatural-
ism is not explained, but he in-
timated that belief in its exist-
ence alone is sufficient.

.- Ultimate" Ideals

He said that supernaturalism is -
the ultimate, not just man’s idea of‘

the ultimate. He admitted that

reason is not absolutely necessary.

for supernaturalism.
Dr. Kannwischer drew lines

— on the blackboard topemphasize

his belief of man’s control being
necessary in‘ belief of a super-
natural idea.

Again Chaplain Parker claimed.
that “You do not look upon su-

pernaturalism——you seek and en-

. ter it.” He stressed the point that

a supernatural power isn’t mere-
ly_the idea of motion and energy,
but the motion and energy itself. .
After a ﬁfteen minute talk by
each speaker, moderator McCar-

thy asked for questions from the

' more than 50 students who at-

 

tended the discussion.

FRIENDLY FOES—Discussion leaders for the talk on “Is Super-

In CD Program Improvement;

In a recent poll of students dealing with the Universitylq

Harvey Freedman, Col. ’57, feels that CD cannot succeed

at Pitt as long as the students’
have no knowledge of the subject.

He feels that publicity should be
made ayailable to the students so
that if “God forbid” anything
should happen-—the students would
know where to go and what to do.

A n 0 t h e r college sophomore,
Maureen -Murray, believes; that
even though the problem" doesn’t
appear to be too pressing at Pitt,
care should be taken. She sug-
gests that CD directions should be
posted behind the glass bulletin
board ' where they would not be
ripped down as the committee on
Civil Defense is afraid of.-

E&M F urnishes New Lounge;

The Engineering and Mines Cabinet is getting right into
the swing of the new building program by furnishing the
lounge in the new E & M Building. '

The new lounge, located on the ﬁrst ﬂoor, gives the

provide eating facilities for them. Two rooms, adjoining the
lounge, house the oﬁices of The Skyscraper Engineer and the

Two picture windows, .the
