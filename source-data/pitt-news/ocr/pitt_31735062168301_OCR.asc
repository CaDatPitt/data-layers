But tuition hike may not be enough

It’s0fficial: Tuition Rises In Fall  i

 

GAMBLING, that the State Legislature will grant the University an

additional $4,000,000, are Vice Chancellor of Finance Edison Mont-

gomery and the University. Should the gamble fail, the University
will incur that debt and be forced to cut back services.

In a move that surprised no
one, Chancellor Wesley W. Pos-
var informed students of a tui-
tion hike that will go into effect
this September. -

The increase will raise tuition
for. full-time Pennsylvania un-
dergraduate and graduate stu-
ents in all schools except Medi-
cine and Dental Medicine by $70
a term. Those enrolled inthe two
professional schools will pay
$510 per term, an increase of
about 40% over the former rate.

Four representatives of Wom-

~« en Concerned for. the Unborn

Child (WCUC) expressed oppo-
sition to a proposal, to liberalize
Pennsylvania’s abortion laws. In
a panel discussion sponsored by
WCUC a -week ago Wednesday,
Mary Griffen, Dr. Anna Patton,
Mary Quinn. and Norbert Win-

. ter spoke against the bill propos-

ed by State ‘Representative Gerry
Kaufman.

Auditorium was Mrs. Griffen,
associate professor- in the Gradu-
ate School of Social Work. Mrs.
Griffen denounced the.abortion
operation as “peaceful. digni-
fied death."

‘,‘It has been said," she affirm-
ed." that the fetus. like tonsilec-
tomy, is only tissue. and both of
these are alive."

“However, fundamental dif-
ferences exist between fetal and
tonsilectomy. Fetal tissue is
unique in quality, whereas ton-
silectomy is related to other tis-
sues. The tissue which is pro-
duced at conception will never
reoccur. '

. “Secondly, fetal tissue does I
;  not belong to the mother-, as"

Out-of-state students will be
hit considerably harder. Full-
time out-of-state students will
pay $150 more next term, rais-
ing the per—term total to $980.

In the letter sent by Posvar to
all students announcing the in-
creases, the Chancellor noted
that, “These increases are made
but
they are necessitated by the bud-
getary situation in Harrisburg."

MORE DRASTIC
That situation, still tense, may

make steps more drastic than the
tuition raise necessary. Unless‘

the State Legislature boosts
Pitt’s appropriation by 3.5-4.3
million dollars early next year,
the University will incur a de-

ficit during the 1970-1971 fiscal-

year, which began yesterday.

In a Pitt News interview, Edi-
son Montgomery. Vice Chancel-
lor for Finance, admitted that
the University is running the
risk that its request for addition-
al funds might not be met. But

he expressed a cautious opti-.

mism: "I think the state will
come through with an augmen-
tation. though I don’t know what
the magnitude will be."

Explaining the need for a tui-I

tion increase. Montgomery noted
that the University‘s current
budget exceeds last years by
7.6 million dollars . . . "largely"
because of inflation. partly be-
cause of“ some increase in en-
rollment." '

"We asked the state for an
increase in appropriation -of 7.4
million dollars," he recalled.
"but the state told us we didn‘t
stand a chance of getting it.
They said, ‘You must raise tui-
tion, and you must raise it as
much as you possibly can.‘ "

The administration decided
that tuition could be raised by
20% at the most. “If we raised it
more than that,” Montgomery
argued, “we would have" been
changing the_ character of the

Raps Abortion .

. tonsil is not.”

Mrs. Griffen suggested what
she considered suitable alterna-
tives to abortion. Among those
men-tioned were liberalized abor-
tion laws, a guaranteed annual
income. expansion of day-care
centers. and better attention for
the retarded.

THERAPEUTICS

Dr. Patton, an obstetrician
who serves on the _staffs of West
Penn and’ McGee hospitals, re-
lated the policies of the medi-
cal profession concerning thera-
peutic abortion.

“If the mother’s life is en-
dangered,” Patton explained, “a
therapeutic abortion is per-
formed.” She stressed, however,
that such a request is granted in
only extreme cases.

The obstetrician expressed ‘ her
concern that aliberalized abor-
tion amendment would pave the

way for “not abortion as a ne-.»

cessity. but abortion upon’ de-
mand."

ATTACKS SOCIETY

Mary "Quinn. a graduate of
Carlow College as an English-
Philosophy major. and. a par-
ticipant in social affairs. claim-
ed that she was’ "not surprised’
that babies were-sh_ot at My Lai.

"‘As a society we are lazy,”

‘the activist maintained. “We are
reluctant to face our problems,
and_ we are deeply intrenched
with death.

“We must put a halt to it and
endorse life. Let us create a sit-
uation in which’ people aren't
afraid to have children."

MOTHER DEFENDS

VNorbert Winter. Duquesne Un-
iversity graduate with a degree
in Psychology and a member of
the Pittsburgh Committee for
Human Rights. remarked that
"the mother is the most logical
defender of the unborn child."
and defined abortion as "the ul-

» timate copping out of responsibi-

.lity.

"Everyone has the inalien-
able right to life." Mrs. Winter

contended. "The abolitionists de- f

mand that this be conditional.

{Should the right to live depend

on whether someone is thought
of as human? I ‘ _
Mrs. _Winter regarded Ameri-

ca as “a heartless society of

hatred and separatness. Reject
‘this heartless society and con-
struct one which is ,‘based on
love," she appealed, to her au-
dience.’ . , . -

University.” Elaborating, he
voiced‘ the fear that “sons and
daughters of lower and middle
income parents” might have been
obliged to leave Pitt.

It is estimated that the tuition
hike will yield 3 - 3.5 million
dollars. That still leaves. though.
a gap of approximately 4 million
dollars.

The University‘ was hoping
that the State Legislature would
appropriate enough to fill the
gap by yesterday. But instead
the Legislature passed a stop-
gap appropriations measure last
week, providing Pitt with only
50% of last year's appropriation
and no additional funds.

“We can be reasonably con-
fident that the other 50% will be
forthcoming,” Montgomery ob-
served. But not until January,
February, or March will it be ’
known whether Harrisburg will
provide the extra 3.5 - 4.3 mil-
lion dollars needed by the Uni-
versity.

The administration. which
hunted in vain for a crystalball,
could have adopted a’ defeatist
attitude and drastically reduced
expenditures for this fiscal year,

.nue program and continued" as

  
    
    
 
   
   
   
 
    
  
   
  
  
  
 

thereby avoiding the risk of- a .
deficit but also precluding the
possibility of obtaining more I -_
funds. It chose, however, a more ,' 
daring course of action.

Should the gamble prove un-
successful, Pitt will be in the‘.
grips of another financial crisis
early in 1971. “If the Legisla-"'
ture gives, us little or no augmen-p
tation," Montgomery declared
"we will have to borrow money
and incur a deficit.” Programs‘
for the 1971-1972 fiscal year’
would then be severely cut. '

But the University is hoping_
for the best. «.“We will take a‘ _.
risk,” ~Montgomery concluded, __
admitting that administrators like 5
himself could end up with “egg A -_
on our faces.” ‘ . ‘ ~

With the help of students, that’.’,
might, not happen. Montgomery" "
believes voters will support" can- .
didates for the State Legislature I
who favor a comprehensive reve-

sistance to institutions of higher_._*j
learning. ‘-‘The time for students
to act is between now and elec-
tion time," he declared. “Stu-as
dents can and should get candi-
dates, to express their views.” _ ~

The Astronomy Department at the University is one of the

 

_ smallest around. It boasts four full-time faculty members and two

graduate assistants who double as Ph.D. candidates. Correction on
that: it formerly employed two. Bob Nelson finally got the axe and
his students with him. In fact, all students with him.

During the last school term, THE PITT NEWS carried a series
of articles at the behest of his students landing the exemplary teach-
ing methods of Nelson.

But apparently excellence in instruction fails the criteria test
for the department heads because Nelson was recently notified that
his services as a teacher were no longer required.

The reaction of Astronomy 12 students was overwhelmingly
favorable to the beareded prof. Registration attests on one level: in
sharp contrast to the past, enrollment for the course exceeded 160
students. For the most part, they were not Astronomy or Natural
Science majors. “

Another factor was provided by a poll conducted by Nelson at
the end of the Winter term. The results indicated that only three of
the 160 respondents were dissatisfied with his instruction.

But then we can assume that “good teaching” is not a prere-
quisitefor employment in that department if one examines the rec-
ord of the chairman. .

A woman that refused to reveal her name “because I might
meet him in the halls,” had a lot to say about the quality of Dr. Nich-
olas Wagman’s approach. - V ‘

Labelling him initially “'very.rig'id,” the former General Studies

, enrollee in Astronomy 781 related that she “gave up after the first

three weeks.”

“I thoughtlthat I was the only one,” she said, “but then I start-
ed to talk to some of the other studentsiin the; class and I found out
that everybody felt the same way about Wagman.”

THE PITT NEWS double checked and discovered that another

' student told the same story. Only this time, the student was a double

major in Astronomy and Political Science who labelledboth Wag-
man and fellow faculty ‘member and new director, of the Allegheny_
Observatory, Dr. Joost Kiewet'De Jonge, “the plagues.” ' V '

So possibly ANelson’s fine record was irrelevant and he was dis-

missed on the basis of his research accumulation’. , ,
After all, -the fieldof Astronomy is fresh with-many questions
still unansweredin  ' ‘ ' V ‘  ‘ .

THE PITT NEWS then surveyed his publications and compared
them withthose produced by the department faculty. -~

It, was discerned" that‘Nelson published two "articles within" the 
last year in the .‘‘Astronomical Journal,” one of two publications. -

His work had also appearedrecently in the “Astronomical So-

"New Student Worl:shop” Hits Pitt

by BOB BONN

After many long years of hav-
ing many long speeches and many
bored freshmen, Orientation has
changed.

All but a few critical items
were new in this year’s 0rien-ta-
tion. In fact. even the name was
changed.

Removing the stigma of the
word "freshman,“ the activity is
now called “The New Student

Workshop.” Centering on a theme

Director

Named

Mrs. Glenora Edwards Ros-
sell, acting director of the Univer-

sity of Pittsburgh Libraries since ‘

last January, has been named
director of University Libraries.

She replaces Dr. C. Walter
Stone who is resigning his post
after five years to do private con-
sulting and teaching. As director,
she will be responsible for Hill-
man Library and other University
library collections.

Mrs. Rossell came to Pitt as a
documents librarian in 1958. She
subsequently became the first li-
brarian for the Graduate School
of Business, assistant to the di-
rector of University Libraries and
acting director.

of “Alternatives and Comitment
Today,“ the Workshop offered
sessions on the environment. the
changing role of women, student
dissent, and drugs. Also added
for the first time were simple
"rap sessions" with faculty mem-
bers, and coffee hours with the
various departments in the Col-
lege.

Carl Van Horn, committee
chairman, explained that the bas-
ic premise behind the new pro-
gram was that the new students
for this fall are mature individ-
uals who want to know more about
college life than simply where the
buildings are located and what
classes are required.

“We’re not going to orient

‘ them,” Van Horn emphasized,

“They’re going to orient them-
selves.”

So in addition to the most neces-
sary traditional activities (such
as placement tests, meetings with
academic advisor, etc.), the new
programs centered on the major
issues at the University and at

The game is a Saturday nigh

other institutions around the
country.

For example, there was a par-
ticularly well-attended session on
“Military Obligation and Alter-
natives.” This discussion was
three-sided, having as speakers a
representative from ROTC; a US
attorney, Blair Griffith, who
serves as a prosecutor in draft
cases; and George Schumacher,
a draft counselor and defender.

The problems of commuters
was discussed at one meeting;
life in the Towers and Quad was
discussed at another. Dr. Stanley
Shostak from the biology depart-
ment teamed up with Dr. Dave
Arey from geography for a multi-
media presentation on the en-
vironment.

most of them were not required.

The recreational activities also
changed, as the boat ride was re-
placed by a showing of “The

man.

Freshman reaction to the work-
shop was generally good. Sever-
al hosts and hostesses noted that
this year’s class is apparently a
rather vocal group which is will-
ing to express their own ideas.
Further, most of the sessions
were well-attended, even though
attendence was not required.

the new students have had the op-
portunity to gain new outlooks and

tant situations at the University.

 PittiAthletics..
Freshman Gets

First Look

' by GEORGE GAVIN

(Editor's Note George Gavin was one of the freshmen here for
orientation this week. The following are his first impressions _of Pitt
athletics as viewed after the athletic department’s introductory con-
ference Tuesday.) '

, On Tuesday afternoon I attended a conference centered upon
Pitt’s athletic program as a part of my new Student Workshop ‘70.
The talk included both inter-collegiate and intramural sports.

Coming from a small high school which had only three compe-
titive sports and a very. limited intramural sports program, I was,
needless to say, somewhat awed by the vast extent of the Univer-
sity’s athletic program. I knew that the program was large, but I
never imagined it to be this wide in scope. .

However, a wide range of sports does not make an athletic pro-
gram good or bad. It is the quality of a team’s play and a success-
ful season that count in the eyes of most people. Most Pitt stu-
dents, even we neophytes, know that last year’s football, basketball
and baseball teams did better than they had been doing for quite a -
few years.

But what about the other sports? There is little mention of them
in the city newspapers. What is the difficulty? Could it be that
some of these sports are played at locations unaccessible by stu-
dent and outside spectators?‘

Now I would like to touch upon intramurals. From the infor-
mation I gathered at the conference, I would say that it is a very
diverse program. There is an activity to suit most anyone’s taste.

Since the intramurals will he conducted on a round-robin basis
next year, I think the program will be more interesting, enjoyable,
and worthwhile. If students do not avail themselves to the program,
they could be missing out on a great opportunity.

So far, I have been very impressed with Pitt’s athletics. The
program offers many opportunities -to the students, and I feel that
it is up to the students to make the athletic program even better by
participating in intercollegiate and intramural sports.

Another Kind Of Life

By ED CONLEY
Sports Editor

The destruction of Forbes
Field by the fans after the Pir-
ates’ double header sweep over
the Chicago Cubs last Sunday
ssures the Pittsburgh baseball
club that it will no longer be
playing at Forbes, regardless of
progress at Three Rivers Stad-
ium on the North Side.

Many students at Pitt will ben-
efit from the ground across from
Hillman Library when a vast
complex is contracted there by
the University. But there will
be students who will miss the
short walk to see a ball game.
Not many universities are locat-
ed so close to a sports fans hav-
en like Forbes Field.

But let’s go back a few years,
to 1962. To the North Side. Peo-
ple over there first remember
hearing of the possibility of a
stadium near them in that year.
The current site of Three’ Rivers
is where the residents expected
the park to be built.

..The closest group of houses
to the site was in the 800-block
of Reedsdale Street, and the
occupants of those places en-
joyed speculating.

A woman who owned a small

restaurant which would be the
closest one to the Stadium pro-
claimed, “I’ve got the corner

A couple doors down the
street, a man who had recent-
ly retired from working in the
junk yard that occupied the fu-
ture Stadium site whispered, al-
most in tears, “Back where base-
ball belong .' . . The exy (pro-
nounced “X-E”). O1‘ Exposi-

one’s doin’ something right for

His wife, not a baseball fan,
interrupted. “Doin’ something’
right? Why, my windows! I
won’t have a one left when
they’re all through with a what-
checallit . . . a pennant.”

“Don’t worry, Grandma,” her
twelve-year-old grandson attempt-
ed to comfort her. “With this

balls than anybody else around.“

The people of the 800-block of
Reedsdale Street didn’t think of
.1970 students at the University
of Pittsburgh. They didn't care
about much more than what
they were doing the next day in
1-962.‘ And the thought of a
brand new ballpark so close trig-
gered such dreams.

The dreams were shattered,
though. After years of delay,
the "Bridge to Nowhere” (the
affectionate name for the Fort
Duquesne Bridge which crosses
the Allegheny River near the
Point, downtown) finally went
somewhere—right through the
middle of the 800-block of Reed-
sdale Street.
