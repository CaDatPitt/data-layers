DENTALS ATTEND I

___.__‘ A

During this week the , following
Dental’ Associations, all of them being
national in scope, are holding annual
meetings at Ann Arbor, Michigan:
The Dental Educational Council of
America, the American Institute of

Association of Dental , Faculties. _

The. University of Pittsburgh is well
represented at these meetings by the;
following members of _the Dental
Facultyi Drs. H. E. Friesell, H.

J. "F. Biddle, Robert Zugsmith, C. O.
Booth, P. V. McFarland, L. W. Ohl, A.
L. Evans, E. C. Shryock, E. Weger, S.
D.,Emrick, J. C. Hipple, A. B. French
and H. D. Fonda. - 1 _ ‘
Dr. J. F. Biddle is Secretary of the
American Institute of Dental Teachers. .
These meetings promise to be the
most interesting and important in the
history of all three associations, ‘and
very decided steps in the increasing
of the. entrance ‘requirements to

the dental curriculurnpand the length-
ening "of the dental ‘course to four‘
years are} some of the things that will
likely -be accomplished. Dean Frie-
sell, as -Chairman of the Curriculum
Committee, will present ,a‘ proposed
minimum dental curriculum to bere-
quired of all dental schools admitted
to the highest grade in the classiﬁca-
tion adopted by the Educational
Council and‘ the National Association
of Dental Examiners. « - = -

The Dental Educational Council is
also completing a thorough, inspection.
and classiﬁcation of the dental schools
of the country, similar to ‘the wo-rk
done ‘a few years ago by the Carnegie‘
Foundation ‘among the medical
schools. The rapid developments that
have taken place in the ﬁeld of dental
education in recent years demand a
complete re-organization of the teach-
ing methods that have been in practice
heretofore. - . .

PITT MUSICALCLUBS I 
MAKING FINE RECORD.

The successful season of the musical
clubs was further augmented by the
delightful rendition of a concert in
the Christ M. E. Church last Friday“
evening. Despite the inclement
weather, the auditorium was well ﬁlled
and the audience was quite generous.

with the exception of February '26th,
the night of the Cap* and Gown pro-.
duction. Work on the spring trip has
been progressing, but as yet nothing
deﬁnite has been‘ arranged. .

A number of new candidates report-
ed last Tuesday evening and the old
men will have to report for rehearsals
if they expect to be retained on the

the decisionof, men last week; There
was an abundance of good imaterial

luctance that some of the men, who
came out for the show_ and who
showed wonderful ability were drop-
ped. It was thought at first that they
might be carried as understudies for
the regular". parts but this would in-
‘volve a great deal of expense -in carry-
ing them around on trips, an expense
the club could not comfortably bear.
. The management feels highly grat-"
iﬁed with the work of the cast and
chorus. Last week a corps of clerks
and stenographers were busy ,_get-
ting ready the mail to give the pro-
duction wide publicity. .

SOCIALISTSSPONSOR I A
' v I ANTLMILITARISM.

Encouraged by the success of ‘the’
anti‘-military mass meeting held by
the students of Columbia University
League, .the;local chapter of the Inter,
Collegiate -Socialist,“ together with the
chapter of Tech, took the initiative‘-in
organizing a huge anti-military meet-
‘ing to be held under the auspices of
the student bodies of both_ institutions.
It is planned to have. prominent
men from ‘both Pitt and Tech as well
as other noted orators to address the
meeting. ,
already been secured. All’ the other
speakers as well as the time and place
of the meeting will be announced
later. , I ‘ .
Both socialist chapters wish it .7 to
be clearly understood that this meeting
is not going to be-under their auspices,
but under the uspices of the student’
bodies, which means thht. all the
students must ‘display enough enthus-
iasm"to warrant the success ‘of the
undertaking, so as _to place.‘ Pitt on
‘an equal -footing with the big
universities of -the east.‘ '

With $750 already subscribed, the
managers of the Owl are bending every
effort to secure the balance of the
necessary $1,200.00 before Monday
night. The balance to ‘becol-lected~ is
still large"enough to _make consider-

able work for the managers“ unless

the students ,’who have not paid up

 make an effort to .se'e.the ‘manager in
their .department,. The Junior fee of

ﬁve dollars is an assessment on each

member of the class and not a volun-‘

tary subscription. For members -of
the other classes the price of the Owl
is two dollars and a subscription may
be secured by paying one do1lar‘now
and the rest when the book is publish-
ed, or the subscription may be paid ‘in
full now. ‘

activities should put an accur-

will be only slightly in excess of the

One year ago(Wednesday, January
26, 1914, the ‘great University An-
niversary Fund campaign closed.

Probably never before in. the history '

of any university was such a campaign
conducted. Yet with just a year. in-
tervening, the student body as a whole
has almost’ forgotten _ the event.

’ Every one will no doubt recall the ex-
cused classes, the committees, the daily
luncheons, the speeches, the extensive

paper publicity, and the successful,
partial at least, -result. '

.Many ofthe students when speak-
ing of the campaign show considerable
disappointment in not being ‘able to

. see more tangible results. They say

that everyone was interested and
working at that * time and that now
‘nothing is heard of the matter. The
authorities -explain that even though
,two million‘ dollars were pledged to
the fund, it takes a long time for this
_money to be made available. A period
of years is allowed in ‘which to pay
the amounts pledged and, added ‘to
this, the stringent condition of busi-
ness at the present makes payment
hard. , _ “

LACK OF INTEREST
IN HONO_R SYSTEM.

 

In spite of the fact that‘ THE
WEEKLY has implored during the
last few weeks for an expression of
student opinion in regard to the honor
system, there has been very little re-
sponse. A letter from’ each student,
alumnus and members of the faculty
expressing his or jlier opinion was
asked for and very few letters have

been received. ~

"x

There may be a reason for this in
the fact that several students do not
knowcwhat is meant by the honor
system, and do not know how it oper-
ates. The scheme means essentially
merely the withdrawal of the profes-
sional supervision of those undergo-
ing a written examination, and in this
case each student signs a statement
on his paper to the effect that he has

V not given or received aid in its prep-

aration. This idea may be elaborated
so that a students’ committee co-op-
erates with the faculty in maintaining

, the standards of conduct and scholar-

ship and ‘contributing generally to

 - the morale of the institution.

This plan is in operation in many
universities and colleges in this coun-
try and its desirability has been proved
and in every case it has been found
superior to espionage. Men realize
that they are no longer mere school-
boys when they get to college, and
they come’ with the purpose in view
of deﬁnite preparation. It is not nec-
essary to hold them down to iron clad
rules in the matter of discipline.

The matter is now up to the stud-

_  ents, as the members of the faculty

are «willing to do anything that will
be a progressive step. They favor
the honor system if the student body

is ready for, it, if the organization is

strong enough to carry it out properly

_ and not make it simply an innovation
‘ g -to be laughed at.

_Students should recognize their

 amoral qualities and give the system
 an honest trial.

LETTER BOX

Editor PITT WEEKLY:
In answer to your appeal for an
.expression of student opinion on the

.91 honor system, I will say that I think

ithis system should be adopted at once.
;We are men, individuals who have
Ereached an age where we are able to
distinguish between right and wrong,
and furthermore we realize our reason
for spending four years here. _It
should not be necessary for an .111-
structor to. watch the student during
an examination. I feel sure that the
students in Pitt realize their moral
obligations and will make the honor
system a success.
Sincerely ,
A JUNIOR.

 

Editor PITT WEEKLY: '
In reply to the query “Shall Pitt
have the honor system?” the logical
answer seems to be another question,
“Why not?" The University is de-
signed primarily as an educational
institution; then it should also furnish
practice along the lines of self-goveri_i-
ment to as great’ a degre as is
practical. The students are no longer
in secondary schoolswhere every act
must be supervised and passed upon
by the members of the faculty; they
are entirely capable and are entitled
to self-rule. Under the present regime
of petty tyranny, we ﬁnd the student
senate, destined to be the ruling body,
degenerated into a body of ﬁgure-
heads better suited for the sewing
circle of the Old dies’ Home, while
their rightful auth rity is usurped by
faculty oversight. Let us then by all
means place the student body under
the new system and let the same power
punish all offenders by suspension
after a fair trial by a jury of their

peers.

WESTMORELAND COUNTY CLUB OFFICERS

‘DR. R. R. FEIGHTNER, '12.

THE WESTMORELAND
’ COUNTY PITT CLUB.

 

With a \large and enthusiastic
attendance of present and former.
students of the University, the “West-
moreland County Pitt Club" was
organized last Friday night at Greens-
burg, Pa. Weather conditions were
decidedly unfavorable, although it
took more than this handicap to damp-
.en the ardor of the loyal Pitt men.
A total of 64 attended the meeting
and many were heard from who were
unable to make the trip ‘on account
of the bad weather. Had the snow
and rain held off, it is extremely like-
ly that the century attendance mark
would have been passed. The meeting
was held in the Hotel Monahan, and
the menu was excellent. The room
was decorated with Pitt pannants and
banners and with Frank Rugh, of
Jeanette, as cheer leader, there was
plenty, of Pitt enthusiasm in evidence.
Chancellor S. B. McCormick, Dean
H. E. Friesell of the Dental School,
and the General Secretary attended
from Pittsburgh and addressed the
gathering.‘ Charles W. Scovel, chair-g
man of the committee on Alumni
Organizations of Council‘ had intended
to go, also, but was detained at the
last moment. Other speakers in ad-
dition to the three_ mentioned were
W. D. Hockensmith of Irwin and Dr.
B. F. Jenkins of Jeannette, Chairman
of the Committee on Arrangyments.
Dr. W. J. Potts acted as Toastmaster.
The election of officers resulted in
Dr. W. J. Potts '07, of Greensburg,
being chosen President; Dr. Ross'R.
Feightner '12, of Greensburg, Vice
President and Dr. B. F. Jenkins '06,
of Jeannette, Secretary-Treasurer.
Chancellor McCormick told the
Westmorelandites in his usual force-
ful way, something of what the
University has accomplished in recent
years and the great needs of the in-
stitution for the future. He said that
the alumni could be of great aid in
many ways, and especially in the
matter of interesting the state
legislators in giving Pitt a liberal
appropriation. Chancellor McCormick
referred to the fact that he is a
product of Westmoreland County
himself. He told of the great increase

' in enrollment of the University and

of the efficient organization that was
being perfected to educate the young
men and women of this section. The

' fact was emphasized by him that the

University of Pittsburgh has the same’
work in the western part of the state
that the University of Pennsylvania
has in the eastern section and that it
is «entitled to the same consideration
in the matter of appropriations as
her sister institution. 1

Dr. Friesell's. speech was short, but
decidedly to the point, as are all the
Doctor's remarks. He’ told of the
work of the professional schools of
the University, and pointed out some
of the ways that an organization such
as the Westmoreland County Club
could beneﬁt the University. _

The General Secretary outlined the
aims and object of such a club, and
told of the organization of the first

Christmas holidays.
Dr. B. F. Jenkins, Chairman of the
Committee on Arrangements, thanked

one at Punxsutawney during the

all the workers for their support,
stating that the success of the or-
ganization meeting was not due to
the efforts of one man, but to all the
“boosters” in the different towns.

W. D. Hockensmith, an '01 graduate
of the Engineering school, and a for-
mer football captain and coach of the
University, spoke on the advantages
of athletics. “I doubt” said he, “If
the University would be in its present
position if it weren't for football.” He

told of the support which Dr. Friesell

gave athletics at the time when the
alumni were trying to “boom” such
activities. Mr. Hockensmith made a
decidedly happy speech.

After the election of oﬂicers, the
meeting adjourned to the hotel parlor
and lobby, where the -alumni and
students proceeded to get better ac-
quainted and talk over old times. It
was decided that annual banquets will
be held during the winter and that a
picnic will also be arranged for at
some convenient spot in Westmoreland
County during the summer.‘

Pittsburghers were as follows:

the ‘college yells, as they gave the
“Allegenee" with lots» of “pep.” In
additionto being cheer leader, Frank
was decorator and all around handy
man. He deserves. ‘a special vote of
thanks from the members of the club.

W. D."-3 Hqckensmith, brother ‘of
Dutch Hockensmith, the grid star,

 

. hasn't forgotten his old love, athletics.

He gave this activity a big big boost
in his remarks at the meeting. Mr.
Hockensmith is a member of the Hock-
ensmith Wheel and Mine Car Company
at Penn station. He played football
for “W. U. P." more than a decade

. ago. and later coached the team.

Dr. H. H. Murray, Coroner of West-
moreland County, and a graduate of
the Medical School, .. class of 1905,
helped get the Greensburg and Young-
wood alumni to the meeting. He is
an enthusiastic Pitt booster."

Dr. W. J. Potts, the newly elected
President of the club is slated to be
the next Coroner of the county. Dr.
Potts has been associated with Dr.
McMurray the present Coroner.

If Pitt has a more loyal worker
than Dr. B. F. Jenkins, '06, of Jean-
nette, we want to see him.' Dr.
Jenkins worked with all his might to
make the Greensburg affair a success
and certainly “made good." With him
as Secretary-Treasurer of the club, it
is bound to be an eﬂicient organization.‘

. Dr. Jenkins is a brother of H. F.

Jenkins, '14, former varsity football
manager, and R. W. Jenkins, '17, "He
too, managed the football team while
an undergraduate.

R. K. Pickard, '12, of Scottdale, who
is employed in Connellsville, did some
ﬁne work in rounding up the alumni
of the Coke City for members of the
Alumni Association. He tickled the

. Alumni Secretary by handing him an

even half dozen applications for
membership and checks for dues from
the “grads" of that section. That's
the kind of work that counts.

Dr. Ross R. Feightner, '12, the Vive
President of the club is remembered
by all, as one of our greatest football
tackles. We ﬁnd since taking up this
alumni work that the football men
have it on any other particular class
of alumni in the matter of spirit for
Alma Mater. Of course, many
hundreds of men who never played
football‘ are just as loyal. But it
seems that EVERY football man has
the spirit.

The oldest alumnus present was C.
L. Kuhn, '80, of Mt. Pleasant. Mr.
Kuhn is a Pharmacy graduate. Next
oldest was Dr. J. H. Ringer, '88, of
Jeannette. Dr. Ringer is a graduate
of the Medical School.

We were sorry that R. T. McCormick
'88, of Irwin was unable to attend.
Mr. McCormick wrote a letter of re-
gret,; stating that he was deeply
interested in the affair, but that press
of business made it impossible for him

mick, '02, of Irwin attended.

.W. J. Fetter, '18, better known as
“Bill," did the proper thing by bring-
ing his father, Dr. W. H. Fetter, '90,
to the meeting. The. Fetters live at
Scottdale.

issue of the Weewly. All men who
have received their insignia for
athletic activity at the University will
be eligible for membership in this
club. As there is 8. long list of these

THE CHARTER DAY B—A—NQUET.

Arrangements for the Charter Day
Banquet, February 26th, are maturing
rapidly. The entertainment committee_
of Alumni Council will hold a meeting
some time this week to complete
further plans. Charles W. Scovel, '83,
will be toastmaster. Mr. Scovel is
certainly the right man for this all
important position. He was toast-
master at the famous Charter Day
banquet three years ago when the
125th anniversary of the University's
birth was celebrated.’ The list. of
speakers for February 26th has about
been completed. Guests will be here
from all over the world to attend the
Mellon Institute dedicatory exercises
and many will be at the banquet. _It
is expected that this will be one of
the most successful affairs of its kind
the University has ever had. The list
of out-of-town alumni will be large.

“THE OWL” CAMPAIGN.

“Owl” and help boost the campaign for
ﬁnancing that important publication
may ‘send their $2.00 subscription
check to the general secretary. He
will see that it reaches the proper
person and that ‘you get your book
when it is published. Last year, quite
a number of alumni advised us that
they desired an “Owl" and were un-
able-to get one. By this method you
will be sure to be taken care of.

THE JUNIOR PROM.

Don't forget the Junior Prom,
February 11th, alumni. The general
secretary has a supply of tickets to
dispose of to the “grads" at the rate
of» $5.00 per couple. Call or phone
him and he will take care of you.
This promises to be one of the most
sgccessful social events we have ever
had at the University, and we Want
to see a big outpouring of alumni.‘ It
will be a “Pitt" affair through and
_through and only students, alumni

University can secure tickets.

GENERAL ALUMNI 7 _

A special meeting of the General
Alumni Association of the University
will be held in Room 302, Thaw Hall,
tomorrow, Saturday night, to consider
the report on revised Constitution and
By-Laws proposed by the Alumni
Council, as acted on at it's recent

 LATE STAIIT

PULLS DOWN  
 THj_E__BAL‘llN

After making the poorest sort of
start, Pitt underwent a startling re-
vival last Friday night, and won out
over Gettysburg, 41-30. In the early
stages it looked like an utter rout for
the Varsity, but Flint got the pul-
motors to work, and the ﬁnal result

' was sufﬁciently pleasing.

The boys from the battleground be-
gan the game with some whirlwind
play that gave them a 16-5 _lead with
the ﬁrstlhalf about two-thirds over.
At this point Pitt’s reaction set in,
and the Blue and Gold began to show
to better advantage. Matson ‘secured
the ﬁrst ﬁeld goal for Pitt, shortly
followed by a successful shot by Och-
senhirt. These, with Lubic’s_ eleven
foul goals, gave Pitt 15 points to
Gettysburg’s 18 in this period.

The. Varsity opened the second half
with their heaviest artillery, and soon
overcame the visitor’s lead. Four or
ﬁve ﬁeld goals in rapid succession put
Pitt well ahead, and from that time
on it was a canter to the ﬁnish, which
showed the Varsity in front by eleven
points. . _

’ The principal factor in Pitt’s vic--
tory was the foul shooting of Lubic.
But for the work of the Braddock
brunette, the University \W0l1Id1l’l‘.
have been in it in the first half, when
he contributed eleven out of ﬁfteen
points. After missing the ﬁrst free
try, Bengmade the next seventeen, set-

_ ting a record'which should stand for

some time, unless he feels like break-
ing it in the near future. Lubic had
the crowd with hi-m all the time, and
the whole house was pulling for his
record. ' _ ,

Gettysburg showed an uncanny abil-
ity to cage the ball from a_distance,
the particular feature of their side of
the game being a shot by Turnbull,
over half the length of the ﬂoor. The
ball went through without touching
the rim,——about the most perfect shot

,, ever pulled in the Gym. Williams and

Campbell also turned in long throws.
Mahaﬁie, the Gettysburg captain, was
their leading scorer, however, W1th.16
fouls and three ﬁeld goals. Playing
with a broken nose, Mehafﬁ managed
to give Ochsenhirt a busy evening.

Pitt was woefully" weak, especially
in the ﬁrst half, on ﬂoor work. There
seemed to be a strong desire on the
part of the Varsity to gather in one
spot on the ﬂoor, and hold the ball
there. Under such conditions, it was
not very difficult for Gettysburg to
keep baskets down to a minimum. In
the second period, Pitt loosened up
considerably, and kept their oppon-
ents on the run. In this, Carlson and
Hastings were the prime factors. '

Gettysburg made a poor move in
shifting Campbell from center to for-
ward, substituting Bostock at the
pivotal position. Campbell had put-
jumped Matson, but Joe found little
diﬂiculty in taking the toss from Bos-
tock, and this contributed materially
to Pitt’s scoring _ streak. Matson
again led the team in ﬁeld goals, ring-
ing up ﬁve. _ _

If Pitt is to win the majority of the
games on the Eastern trip it vinll have
to show a lot more teamwork and less
standing in one place. Too many
passes went wild last Friday, and _too
much energy was wasted in dribbling.
It may be that these faults can be
ironed out in practice this Week and
next. ~

FRESHMEN HAVE
, THE HABIT, TOO.

 

The Freshmen cut the fourth notch
on their stick last Friday night,»ﬁn-
ishing the game with a lead of four
points over Crafton. The boys from
the town east of _Carnegie gave
Landis’ pupils a hot time of it, losing
29-25 after playing almost even
throughout the engagement.

Nicholas displayed ‘remarkable
shooting a bility, caging seven shots

. and narrowly missing several others.
On the ﬂoor, Davis was, as usual, the
shining light for the Freshmen, while
Meadows broke up many of Crafton’s
combinations. Winterhalter was the
leading star for the visitors, with four
baskets to his —-credit, and with Dunn
showed to advantage in the passing

Foul goals—Lubic 17 out. was such‘ an article.

LOOKING ’EM oven  

’At nine twenty last Friday night
the average Pitt man looked like Or-
ganized Baseball, the morning after
a Fed raid. Forty minutes later, the
same man felt, looked and talked like
a million dollars. At nine twenty the
score was Gettysburg 16, Pitt 5. At
ten o'clock Pitt had 41‘ points, while
Gettysburg’s total was 30. Outside of
this, the evening was dull and the
game unexciting.

__.o.._

Mr. Gardner, the gentleman from
Massachusetts, may rest in peace
as regards the necessity of a commit-
tee of inquiry into the state of the
nation’s war praparedness. Every-
thing will be known after-Saturday,
February 6, for on that eventful date
the Pitt basket ball team will apply
the acid test to_ the West Pointers,
while the splash squad will make a
raid on the Mi-ddies.

Coming back to basket ball, Where
the water isn’t nearly so deep, we take
pleasure in advancing the claims of
one Elliott Hastings as the Percy
Srmallwood of basket ball. The almost-
red-headed forward -covers enough
ground to make up for a whole team.
If he got twenty cents a mile, as Con-
gressmen do, he'd be independently
wealthy after one night's work.

._.0._...

Hastings is in a fair way to steal
Ochsenhirt’s stuff as a catch-as-catch-
can howler. When Pitt was trying to
get out of Gettysburg’s dust, along
near the middle of the game, the
voices of “Andy” and “Butch” fairly
pushed the rest of the team along. If
the rest of the team weren’t practical-
ly speechless, the crowd wouldn’t
have much chance to make itself
heard.

._.o__L

As a foul-shooter, Lubic seems to
be as sure as death and taxes. After
missing the ﬁrst one, Ben got his
breath and pushed through seventeen
.without a slip. He scored 11 of Pitt’s
points in the ﬁrst half, when the Blue
and Gold gunnery seemed to be sadly
at fault. In the second period, Pitt
didn’t have time to bother with fouls,
so Lubic shot only six.

Lafayette’s forwards are named
Stone and Hammer. They ought to
be hard men to stop.

. ' A0... t

Fees, one of Juniata’s hard-shooting
forwards, left his shoes in Trees Gym
when he departed after the ‘game with
Varsity. In acknowledging their re-
turn by Director Miller, Fees also
‘makes acknowledgment of ‘,‘the _un-
equalled sportsmanship whi"c_h charac-
terizes and distinguishes the Pitt
brand of athletics from all others.”

Such a letter as this is pleasing, to
say the least, in view of Pitt’s policy
to extend the best‘ treatment to vis-
iing teams, and to give them a square
deal at all times. In the same con-
nection, it is worthy of note that in
the past three years -not a, serious
complaint has been made against the
oﬁiciating of “Free” Davis. If any-
thing, Davis is inclined to ‘give Pitt
a little the worst of it. This is, un-
fortunately, by no means a common
fault among “home” oﬁicials. A

Ago?

On present form, Matson ought to
have ‘little diﬂiculty in leading the
Varsity in ﬁeld goals. Perhaps the
Kaiser could use Shadyside Joe at
throwing bombs from an aeroplane.
This suggestion isn’t to operate,
though, until he graduates. Up to
that time we can use him here. .

With the Freshmen keeping up a
consistent record, Pitt basket ball
teams have yet to lose axgame. At
this point we knock wood. “Petey”
Davis led his cohorts‘ to victory over
Crafton last Friday, and came out
ahead in a close one. Crafton showed
about the best team the Freshmen
have yet played, especially in shoot-
ing. .

AOA.

If it weren’t for an occasional let-
ter from some member ‘of the student
body, commenting on the need for real
cheerleaders, we wouldn’t know there
We’ve eaten
turkey at least twice since on last ap-
peared in this vicinity. To tell the
truth, we are beginning to ‘think the

tion, like the bear and the straw hat.

 

SYRACUSE SIGNED
T0 TWO-YEAR CONT,_RACT.

That Syracuse will meet Pitt on
the cinder path is now deﬁnitely de-
cided. This announcement comes at
the moment when negotiations for
the dual meet ‘with Ohio State have
arrived at an adverse conclusion. The
arangements between the two univer-
sities are to- the,eifect that Pitt’ will
journey to Syracuse on May the 8th,
and the representatives of the Salt
city come to Pitt in 1916.

Syracuse is possessed of a track
squad of unusual potentialities, and
the Blue and Gold delegates will be
hard pressed indeed to achieve a tri-
umph over them.

.A SUGGESTION. .

NUT A REUUEST

Sporting Editor, PITT .WEEKLY,
Can you tell us-— V '
Whether there is any reason why

there should be no cheering at most

of our home basketball games?
Why there should be so little organ-
ized rooting at even the championship

games? A
Whether or not a cheerleader’s func-

tion is to lead cheers? ' -
Whether the cheerleaders believe

their term of oﬁice expires on Thanks-
giving Day? - _
Whether it would be considered

the stand overlooking the grass plot
known as Forbes ﬁeld, and the ‘queryl
comes ﬂoating from every department
of the University, “What ‘ of Base-
ba1l?”

Manager Williamson has arranged a
schedule which will tax the prowess
of the lauded“‘Lefty” and the much
heralded “Chalky,” supported by the
best other eight men in the Univer-
sity, to carry to a successful conclus-
ion.

In addition to the names of _the
schools that appear in the schedule
given below the -manager announces
that he was unable toaccept dates
with Penn, Lafayette, John Hopkins,
Columbia, Army, Colgate, Lehigh, and
Georgetown. The failure to obtain
diamond meets with many of these

of them were unable to play on any
day except Saturdays and Wednes-
days. '

The second game with W & J. was
planned for Commencement day, but
owing to a conﬂict in arrangements
the ﬁnal date of that game has not
yet been deﬁnitely decided.

Forbes ﬁeld will be the scene of the
encounter with State, and it is plan-
ned to make this oe of the ‘celebration
days .of the springtime in the Uni-
versity. Something in the line of a
straw hat or white trouser day has
been thought of, but deﬁnite arrange-
ments will be made public later.
Following is the schedule as
anged to date: '

MOUNTAIN EERS VISIT
UNIVERSITY TONIGHT.

Tonight the Pitt forces, under the
personal command of that valiant
Teuton, Captain “Butch” Ochsenhirt,
will meet the Mountaineers from West
Virginia university. It will be a
ﬁght to the ﬁnish and no quarter
given. This is the ﬁrst time in several
years thatthe school at Morgantown
has been represented on the basketball
floor, and very little can be judged
as to their ability. They have Won
several» minor games this year, but
the game tonight‘ with Pitt will be
the ﬁrst really hard contest.

A new combination may be seen
when the local squad takes the ﬂoor
for this game. It is known that the
loose work, much in evidence last
week, was very unsatisfactory to the
coach. » The playing as a whole,
especially in the ﬁrst half, was the
poorest put up by the team this year.
The men would work the ball down
the ﬂoor only to lose it when near
the basket. The second half showed
a much improved game which en-
abled them to win out. What this
new line-up will be has not been an-
nounced, but it is hoped that it will
strengthen the teamwork materially.

When the quintet from the “Snake”,
district lineup, Pitt’s center will be up
against a rather chilly proposition.
The two ‘men trying out for that po-
sition travel under the names of Ice,
and Coldbank. Last season’s foot-
ball captain, Leatherwood, may be
seen in at one of the guards. As an
added attraction it is rumored that
our long lost cheerleaders have been
found and may put in their appear-
ance. If they do not show up for the
game they will assuredly be there for
the dance which will follow. A little
less energy wasted on the dance and
a little more expended in leading the
cheering would leave a better impres-
sion on visitors at the games. i

EASTERN JAUNT TO ‘
PROVIDE ACID TEST.

The eastern- trip of the Varsity
basket ball passes begins next Wed-
nesday, when Lehigh University is
met at South Bethlehem. The next
night Lafayette is scheduled, followed
by Rutgers College on Friday night.
The squad then ﬁnishes by playing
the United States Military Academy
at West Point. The team will leave
Wednesday noon and will return

sometime Sunday. Every one of the

institutions on the" list is represented
by a strong teamthis year, and as
each one will be met on its home ﬂoor,
it will be all the harder for the Pitt

In Crichton and Green, Lehigh has
two of the best ﬂoor men in the East.
As usual, both Lehigh and Lafayette
Lafayette defeat-
ed Lehigh recently by a close score.
Rutgers, although defeated by the
West Point team, has a husky bunch
and put up a hard ﬁght. The last
game, with the soldier boys, should
prove the hardest one of Pitt’s season.
The West Pointers have been cutting
a clean swath through the eastern
teams and are out for the champion-
ship. Columbia, Colgate, and Rutgers
are a few of the teams who -have suc-
cumbed to them this year. Oliphant,
star half back on the Army football
team and formerly all-round athlete

"at Purdue, will play one of the for-

wards.

Y. W. C. A.

When the members of the Y. W. C.
A. came out from listening to Dr.
McKelvey’s address on the “Christian’s
Thought of God” last Monday morn-
ing, each and every one had_ a more

of life. So forceful and inspiring were
the sentiments conveyed that his
listeners were thankful that they
were a part of‘ this generation.

‘The speaker showed that God’s
powenvrighteousness, truth, compas-
sion, pity, mercy and justice are but
manifestations of his love. “God is
love,” said Dr. McKelvey. “If you
knew God, you could not help but be
saved for God being love draws us to

stinctively drawn to love.”

HONOR SYSTEM AGITATES

ment prevailing among the student
body.

Chancellor McCormick: “I used the
honor system in all my classes, when
an instructor in the university. In
order to have an honor system the
students themselves must be practical-
ly unanimous for it. Before there can
be an honor system there must be a

‘student organization that will be

effective. The student senate’s decis-
ion must be absolutely acepted.”

Dean J. T. Holdsworth, Dean of
School of Economics: “The success of
the honor system, which‘ theoretically
has much. to commend it, depends en-
tirely- upon the existence of a strong
united opinion favorable to it on the
part of the student body. If such pub-
lic opinion exists, I am heartily in
favor of it.”

Dean J. C. Fetterinan, Dean of
College: “The students ought to con-
fer among themselves to determine
for or against the honor system. Any
movement that is taken should be
-taken among the students as a whole.
I have tried the system successfully
among my own classes, and I certainly
would like to see it prevail amo all
the student bodies. Many of our est
institutions have adopted this system,
and _I should think that of itself
suflicient reason for taking the matter
up at Pitt.”

Dean H.  Mellor, Dean of the
School of Mines: “I am heartily in
favor of the honor system, as soon as
the students themselves want it. It is
certain that such a system constrolled
by the students themselves will be a
success; while just as certainly, if
they are not themselves heartily in

‘ favor of it, it would fail.”

Dr. F. N. Thorpe: “The honor sys-
tem by all means.”

Dr. A. J. Todd, head of the Social-
ogy Department: “I have never used
anything but the honor system so long
as I have been teaching, and I never

expect to use anything else.”

“The honor system at the University

V of Illinois was not oﬂicially adopted

by the whole university, but several
men have used it successfully . We
did It there partly becauselwe believed
in it, and to show the other members
of the faculty that itwould work. I
believe the whole matter depends upon
the student. The student will accept
and -maintain the honor system when
he‘ comes to see that education is a

GRAND.

Vaudeville at the Grand Opera House next
week will provide a measure of diversion for
Mr. Davis’ discriminating clientele that will"
overflow with “mirth. There are to be nine
distinctive headline features in a program
which will be given every afternoon and even-
ing. Prominent amdng‘ these will b the ap-
pearance of the gorgeous and statuesque» Kitty
Gordon, former star of “Alma, Woh Wonst
Du" a titled Englishwoman. Miss Gordon,
who in private life, is"the wife of the Hon.

ish army, a nephew of Lord Beresford of the
royal navy, will play “Alma’s Return,” a

There will be various‘ other attractions, in ad-
dition to moving pictures of the war.

HARRIS.

The feature attraction at the Harris for
the week beginning Feb. 1, is “The Song Doc-
tor,” a musical tabloid.

MILES.

The program for the week of Feb. 1, in
the new Miles Theater will be full of both
novelty and interest. Heading it will be the
delineator of-Jewish types, Joe Welsh, one of
the best-known on the Amercan stage today.
Mr. Welch’s appearance in the Miles Theater
nxt week will be his first in Pittsburgh at
popular prices. -

partnership enterprise in which he and
the instructors are cooperating. When
the student once gets this idea, class
room work, laboratory or .examination
are something more than a mere game
in which his business is to put it over
the instructor if he can. '

“We are commonly told that the
honor system cannot./be worked in
universities unless students have had

the system beforehand in high schools,

but it has always seemed to me on
the basis. of theory and experience
that this is putting too low a price on
the honor of the average . American
student. Sometime or other the stud-
ent must develops a_ code of honor.
If he has ‘not learned _It in the element-
ary or high school, It is of course a

matter for regret; but that should not '

cut_him off from the opportunity of
achieving it_ In the university.”

Men of Pittsburgh interested in the
honor system are discussing it.
