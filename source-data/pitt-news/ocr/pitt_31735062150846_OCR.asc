Italian Club Plans Spaghetti
With Parmesan Dinner

By ALVIN MALAKOFF

He said he was a representative of
the Italian Club and that he had a
story. So down he sat and began to
unravel a description of a dinner that
the club would put on.

“Spaghetti, that’s what we’re go-
ing to have. A re.gular spaghetti din-
ner that will be served from 5:30
until 8 o’clock up in Heinz House on
Monday.”

“Besides,” he continued, “you can
have cheese wi-th your spaghetti, if
you like cheese. It will be the real
thing. Parmesan from I-l Duce’s

land.”

“Then there’s sauce. If you’re a
spaghetti-tangler, you’re interested in
the long strand type. But as every
spaghetti lover knows, it’s the sauce
that counts. We know our sauce. W-e
translated the recipe right fro-m the
Italian.”

He says that everyone is invited
to attend, and that the 50—cent
tickets may be obtained from any
member of the Italian Club or at the
door.

Physicists
Will Hold Open
House Today

Annual open house of the physics
department will be held today from
9 o’clock this morning to 10 o’clock
tonight, with the exhibit free to the
public.

All scientiﬁc devices, demonstra-
tions, and exhibits have been pre-
pared under the supervision of the
department, according to Dr. W. N.
St. Peter, professor of physics, who
is in charge of the affair. Such phe-
nomena as molecules turning over,
light being bent in various ways by
lenses, and the working principles of
automobile motors will be explained
in non—technical language.

Many of the demonstrations are
planned to beneﬁt certain vocational
classes. For example, art students will
view a design-making machine that
does not duplicate the same design
during a period of 24 hours; drivers
will be shown a way to prevent glare
from automobile headlights; and
singers will see pictures of their own
voices for the purpose of pointing out
tone sztriilencies in their vocal work.

Pictures of sound waves and their
uses will be on demonstration to
camera entlnisiasts; draftsmen will
compete for the best drawing of a
square and its diagonals, and the
secret of how bulbs light without
wires attached-—a specialty of shrewd
adverti:~-:ers——wi1l be revealed.

Materials used in the exhibits have
been gathered ‘together at a cost of
several thousands of dollars, and
many months of work done by staff‘
members and assistants, according to
Dr. St. Peter.

Speech Contest Finals
Set For Wednesday

Finals in the 1937 speech contest
will be held next Wednesday, accord-
ing to Carl B. Cass, assistant profes-
sor of English.

Speakers who will compete in the
final trials include Louis l"riedman.

Senior Ball Tries
Apple Polishing
Among Independents

We've been sneaking around very
cautiously. It .'~'C€l1lb' that a fellow by
the 11-'1,In() of Rauck is still looking for
us, and he's pretty determined.

Llnfonunately. our 1‘usc that we.
Butch, are an e\'enin,<: :--=es.'5ion :<lu_d«‘nt
Inns (tone with the wind. Some one
nnist have told Mr. Rauck, and he's
been looking for us. So we wrote this
article at home.

‘M-A-R-T-O-N-l.-L’

One of the Senior Ball flunkies, or
sub—commit'teemen, or something, told
us that, although we finally settled the
piioblein of the orclie;-‘tra lca(le1"';-
name (it's l\'Iarione: Johnny lllarlone
from the West), we were spending
‘too much time on inconsequentials,
and we ought to get down to a few
facts about the Ball.

"Maybe some of the kids’d like to
know,” one of the flunkies declared,
“that we’re gonna give away diplo-
mas at the Ball. Tha't’s something

new, you see, Mr. Butch. And, really,
a news story ought to contain some
news. Don't ya think?”

FREEDOM OF SPEECH

We don't know a tliing about the
(lllllollléts. They may even he sheep-
skin. We don't know. We don"t C\‘(?ll
care, now that even committee-
Iliuil—;_\'inr>n can tell us where to get
off. And we're not afraid to print
that f‘lIIl(‘l'~~€\'L‘l] if Mr. Rauck sees it.

Yes, the boys are going to give a
dance. And they want everyonc—-
ju.~t everyone --— to attend. It's gcoinz
to lie at the T“.'€lll.l‘E‘Ill (,'enf_ui.‘y £7111!)
for $13.-’-0, with Johnny Maziione from

be chaperones.

POSTSCRIPT

Oh, yes. We almost forgot the

Seniors In Secret Poll

By SPIKE

Zzyzzo isn’t a senior. In fact Zzy-
zz-o doesn’t even attend the Univer-
sity. But this can’t stop Spike, for
if Zzyzzo were to be graduated this
June he would have been awakened
very early Monday morning by the
persistent buzz-ring of his telephone.

Atmosphere (Ring — buzz-buzz-
ring.)

And Zzyzz-o would not have liked
it either. For the mysterious tele-
phone marauder, as far as Z could
decipher, was asking his opinion for
somctliing or other in a likewise poll.

On the other side of the line was
Thomas Smith, who goes to the Uni-
versity even if he isn’t a senior.
Tommy, recently -named editor of the

Panther for the coming year, is fol-
lowing the lead of the Literary Di-
gest, another humorous magazine.
Tommy is conducting his own poll,
which is shrouded with mystery and
plans for a rise in circulation.

The results of this senior poll will
be announced in the next is-sue of
the Panther, due to cover campus on
Wednesday. Spike, like Zzyzzo,
doesn’t know what the poll is about.

Candidates Asked

Any persons who wish to be con-
sidered for the co-editorship of The
Pitt Compass, University handbook,
should leave their names with Miss
Alice Beatty, in Room 801, Cathedral,
before noon Tuesday, Theodore W.
Biddle, assistant to the clean of men,
said today.

A man and a woman will be chosen
as co—editors of The Compass.

Candidates for the editor and busi-
ness manager of The Journeyman,
University literary magazine, should
also leave their names with Miss
Beatty. “If it proves necessary, the
Publications Board will hold inter-
views,” he said.

New Book
Exchange
Planned

John Glasser, BA38, was
elected president of Men’s
Council for 1937-38 at the ﬁrst
meeting of next year’s council-
men on Wednesday evening.
Feature of the meeting, aside
from the election, was the an-
nouncement of a book ex-
change project to be operated
by the Council.

Elected to the remaining
Men's Council oﬂices by the 13
members were Robert Dannies,
BA39, vice-president; Robert
Simrell, BA39, secretary; and Milton
Hansberg, M38, treasurer.

YEAR'S WORK RECOUNTED

Following the election, Florian
Majclirzak, E37, retiring president,
recounted ‘the list of projects at-
tempted or completed by Men’s
Council during the year. Heading the
resume of the ﬁrst year’s accomplish-
ments was the Council’s work in car-
rying out the men’s customs pro-
gram, laying the groundwork for the
book exchange, and establishing a
University chapter of Phi Eta Sigma,
national honorary scholastic frater-
nity of freshman men.

To give students a more conve-
nient opportunity to sell their old
books, and to provide a workable used
book exchange, the Men’s Council
student loan fund committee, headed
by Glasser, started an inquiry in‘to
possibilities for an exchange operated
by Council.

EXCHANGE TO OPEN

As a result, the Council book ex-
change will start operation by receiv-
ing used books from students begin-
ning Monday, May 24. Students wish-
ing to sell their books may set the
prices at which they shall be sold.
Used books may be purchased di-
rectly at the exchange, instead of
through the use of a card system of
locating buyer and seller.

Books will not be -bought by the
exchange, bu't will be received on a
consignment basis. Students will re-
ceive their money as soon as their
books are sold, and may withdraw
their unsold books from the exchange
at any time.

To cover costs of operation, 15
per cent of the sale price will be de-
ducted by the exchange; any amount
within the 15 per cent in excess of
expenses will be deposited in the
Men’s Council student loan fund.

LISTS ADVANTAGES

“There are several outstanding ad-
vantages to the exchange,” according
to Glasser. “Students wishing to sell
books can leave them with the ex-
change, while students wishing to buy
books may get them directly from
the exchange, instead of hunting for
someone with the book ‘they want.

“The 15 per cent deducted from
the sale price of books will barely
meet costs of operation for the ﬁrst
year, and this small amount will be
more than overbalanced by the serv-
ice rendered.”

ROSES Are RC6

RECENT action by students of the University
of Pennsylvania, led by an editorial in The
Daily Pennsylvanian, in condemning any demon-
stration or expression of sentiment in favor of
peace again brings to light the mistakenncss of
blanket condemnation through “labelling.”

Declaring that the desire of college students to
speak and demonstrate their anti-war sentiments
has been the result of concentrated Red propa-
ganda, the editorial claimed that American stu-
dents who took part were “serving the Commu-
nist cause.”

Since Communists are in favor of peace, we are
to understand, students who are not in favor of
Communism should not be in favor of peace. That
an overwhelming number of college students dur-
ing the past three years have been “taken in” by
this Communist propaganda to the extent of ex-
pressing their opposition to war is deplorable, we
are told. Since peace has been labelled “Commu-
nist,” college students should make the du Ponts
smile again by having nothing to do with it.

It is signiﬁcant, as a Hearst paper pointed out
last Friday, that all those who are working for
World Peace are really aiding a subversive at-
tempt at World Revolution.

Perhaps that is correct. Perhaps 40,000 col-
lege students who don’t know what they’re doing
are unconsciously aiding the Communist cause
by thinking they believe in peace. Perhaps, after
all, if peace is merely Communist propaganda,
we University students should be squarely op-
posed to it.

To paraphrase Mr. Hearst and The Pennsylva-
nian: “A rose by any other name would smell.”

Political Whirl

By William Stark

We have been criticized for “taking the President for
a ride” in the past, and especially in regard to his ﬁsh-
ing trips. It is our opinion that for the bes't interest
of the country, the President should stay in Washing-
ton, especially during times of “revolt” within his own
ranks. This opinion has proved its own worth in view
of happenings during the past few days.

On Wednesday, the House, by a vote of 385 to 7,
overrode the President’s suggestion to continue the Cl-
vilian Conservation Corps indeﬁnitely. Instead, they
approved only a two-year extension. Many would in-
ter ret this move as meaningless, but if nothing else,
it is illustrative of a general tendency on the part
of Congress toward economy, yes, but also toward
genuine impatience.

Although the CCC issue may be considered a minor
one, there can be no denying the importance of the
WPA grant. From all indications, it seems likely that
Congress will once more “cross up” the President. The
House Appropriations Sub-Committee has already voted
to ‘grant only one billion, instead of the one and one-
half billion asked by the President and WPA Adminis-
trator Harry Hopkins.

Are the Democratic fences falling into a condition
of disrepair? Maybe several additional days spent on
Capitol Hill would have helped out, what with ap-
propriations measures constantly on the ﬁre! Certainly
the well of patronage has not run dry, for if it has,
F.D.R. is in a bad way. We tend to disfavor the latter
explanation, and go back to the old theory that maybe
it is easier to build an astounding majority than to hold
it in check.

From Harrisburg we also hear signs of despair. The
“little” Labor Relations Act passed both Houses by over-
whelming majorities, except for a so-called “equal
rights” clause. This clause prohibits unions from ex-
cluding anyone from membership because of race, creed
or color. All was serene until the State Federation of
Labor began lobbying against this prohibition. The
John L. Lewis forces of the Committee for Industrial
Organization favor the clause.

It seems to us that it is about time that the American
Federation of Labor forces in the State Federation get
next to themselves and recognize that the era of strict
craft membership in trade unions is at an end. That
ceremonials, and fancy initiations, and large fees, and
other forms of discrimination are something of the dim,
dark past.

How do craft unionists ever expect labor to get any-
where in this State if they want to close their mem-
bership to anyone because of race, creed, or color? We
are living in a dynamic, progressive era in the ﬁeld of
labor relations and nothing is to be gained by impos-
ing petty restrictions on laborers as conditions of mem-
bership. Mr. Phillips—-we are living in 1937, not in
the days of Sam Gompers and the nineteenth century.
Away with these clouds of obscurity, and let the sun-
light penetrate the innermost parts of your already-

blackened and disorder*ed house!
* * >i<

Great Britain’s Premier will probably never get over
this coronation. As chief propaganda agent for the
government and the King, he has seen his publicity re-
peatedly take second place to the publicity of Edward
Windsor and Mrs. Simpson. In spite of all his efforts,
the world was more interested in the deposed King than
in the recently-crowned one.

Stanley Baldwin has played a smart game, yet not
so smart. The world seems to disregard his hopes and
desires, and refuses to patronize the greatest show of his
career. Granted Americans “bit” at the Co1'onation, at
any rate those who could afford it, but back home they
have been more eager to “eat up” anything they could
get on the movements of Windsor. It has been a grand
spectacle, this constant strife, and Americans seem to
have enjoyed it. It seems that everything that Bald-
win has done recently just doesn't ﬁt. He is to be re-
placed by Neville Chamberlain, a more suitable repre-
sentative of the ﬁnancial interests. Maybe Baldwin de-

At the University of Richmond, they have a wa.ker-
upper. The gentleness he exercises in awakening fellow
students for eight o'clock classes is just one kind of ad-
vertising that recommends Bernard Gilman, “The Slum-

Heavy Miami Truckin’

Two earthquakes that shook the Miami University
campus not long ago, threw a lasting scare into Profes-
sor Glos, professor of accounting.

“Last week,” said the professor to his students,
“my class was interrupted by an earthquake." His
hands trembled as he spoke.

“Last night while I was preparing the lecture for
this class, my desk got up and started to hop across
the room-—another earthquake.”

The windows of the room rattled gently. “Good heav-
ens, what’s that,” he whispered hoarsely. .

“Just a truck going past,” came from a bored voice
at the back of the room.

Smelling Salts For Puns

“Pun Revival Week” was originated at Fenn College

a short time ago by Dr. William Patterson, professor of
mathematics. The reviving of old puns will sharpen the
wit and lend credence to the blur which represents the
calculus in most sophomore minds, he explained. Hmmr
Our puns need revived too.

Ancient History Pictures
New York, N. Y.——(ACP)——-Snapshots of little boys

in sailor suits and of girls in pinafores, pictures of
Hunter College's faculty taken during their post "goo-
goo" days were ﬂashed on the screen to delight a stu-
dent audience.

It was a public exhibition of the facuIty’s baby days
given to draw in money, at a nickel a head, to be used
by the faculty-student social relations committee for
teas.

The magic-lantern exhibition was a free-for-all
guessing game. As each picture was focused on the
screen, the operator of the projector called out the de-
partment in which the subject was teaching. Students
shouted identiﬁcations with glee. “Kitty, kitty."

Court Problem

President’s Supreme Court
Plan Not Dictatorship Step,
Say Five Staff Members

By ROBERT ADAMS

VVhether or not the President’s plan for reorganization of
the judiciary is enacted into law, the Supreme Court problem

will still remain. And, despite
nents, the proposed plan is not
These two views represent t

all warnings made by its oppo-
a step toward dictatorship.
he concensus of opinion of five

staff members of the department of political science, all of

whom expressed themselves as

favoring reorganization of the

Court.

Because the Court will still have
the right to nullify acts of Congress
by declaring them unconstitutional if
the President’s plan becomes law, the
fundamental problem behind the
present Court situation will, accord-
ing to the ﬁve staff members, remain
unsolved.

REVIEW POWER OVERUSED

In many of its past decisions, the
Supreme Court has overused its ju-
dicial review function, believes Dr.
Benjamin H. Williams, professor of
political science. He says: “It is evi-
dent that the justices canno-t ﬁnd an-
swers to the social and economic
problems of today in the words of the
Constitution. By its many split deci-
sions, the Court has shown that it
rules, not only on questions of law,
but also on questions of general poli-
tical philosophy.”

That the judicial review function
of the Supreme Court has served a
useful purpose in past years, but is
no longer necessary in America, is
the belief of Dr. Roger V. Shumate,
instructor in political science. “In a
fairly well crystallized ‘governmental
system, such as the English,” he says,
“the courts do not exercise the privi-
lege of judicial review. Judicial re-
view belongs to a condition of politi-
cal immaturity, and actually consti-
tutes a limitation on true representa-
tive government.”

CONCUR IN OPINION

Concurring in the opinion that the
Supreme Court should not be per-
mitted to nullify acts of Congress by
declaring the-m unconstitutional are
Dr. Rosalind Branning, instructor in
political science, and Edwin P. Banks
and William H. Young, graduate
student assistants.

“With the President and Congress
being elected by the people at regu-
lar intervals,” declares Dr. Branning,
“I see no reason why they could not
act just as well as the Court as in-
terpreters of the Constitution. I have
more faith in the intelligence of Con-
gress than opponents of the plan
claim to have.”

Instead of being a move in the di-
rection of dictatorship, as many of its

opponents have charged, the Presi-
dent’s plan is actually a step toward
a more democratic government, ac-
cording to the ﬁve political science
teachers questioned in this survey.
The only possibility of a trend to-
ward dictatorship, holds Dr. Williams,
is that the enactment of the Presi-
dent’s plan would remove a powerful
check on his personal authority.

CALLED LIBERAL STEP

But, Dr. Williams points out, the
plan is also a step toward more lib-
eral government in that it would les-
sen the possibility that the Court
might act again, as it has in the past,
in direct opposition to the wishes of
the President and Congress. A
smoother evolution of government
will result, he maintains, if progress
is not blocked by the court.

“The position that the Court has
held in some previous decisions,” de-

rect negation to representative gov-
ernment, when, for instance, the
Court upheld only two of nine major
New Deal measures during the Presi-
dent’s ﬁrst administration.”

In spite of the fact that he favors
the plan for judicial reorganization,
Dr. Shumate‘ contends that its impor-
tance is exaggerated by both its op-
ponents and its defenders.

“If it is enacted,” he says, “the
plan would not destroy the ‘founda-
tions of liberty’ nor would it make
for permanent liberal construction of
laws. Any recomposition of person-
nel that the plan might effect will
be only temporary.

“Even if the plan goes through, the
situation we are in today—-—wi'th the
Supreme Court a holdover from the
conservative Republican regime of
the 1920’s——is likely to be repeated
ﬁve years from now.”

Conditions which might lead to dic-
tatorship will be removed by enact-
ment of the President’s plan, accord-
ing to Mr. Banks. He explains, “the
only way democracy can save itself
is by increasing its own powers. If
the federal government is denied
powers which it should exercise to
rule effectively, a dictator may even-
tually step in and take those powers."

Cadets Tomorrow

Figures Favor Panthers °

As News Picks
Olson Men To Win

By LEONARD LEVISON

Climbing into the Pullmans this
evening, Coach Carl Olson and his
down-but-not-out tracksters head for
West Point where tomorrow after-
noon they will attempt to gain vic-
tory number three against the Army's
swiftest moving unit.

At the same time the Pitt News
hazards a perfect record and tries to
make it four in a row by predicting
the outcome. We even go a little fur-
ther today and prognosticate the ﬁnal
score. The Panthers will win and the
ﬁnal score will be 66-60. Mr. Olson,
please note.

Behind these predictions is the
same basic reasoning that has called
three out of the last three Pitt
meets. Matching, as before, time for
time, and distance for distance of
the competitors,.Pitt has the advan-
tage this week.

ADVANCE SCORE

Gauging the maximum and mm}-
mum points of each team as indi-
cated by the accompanying box SW05
an estimate of the high and low po-
tentialities of each team. From this
we have computed the ﬁnal score by
taking the maximum Pitt points. in
track and adding them to the mini-
mum Pitt ﬁeld totals. This gives an
accurate indication of the ﬁnal Pitt
score, and consequently, doing _the
reverse with the Army totals, gives
the meet score in advance.

At any rate, the ﬁgures favor the
Panthers. Pitt’s minimum total is 55
points. These are points they are cer-
tain to acquire. This means theyhave
to pick up only nine more points to
win, 64 being a majority total. Army's
minimum total is 50, creating a‘ 14‘
point deﬁcit.

Of course, if track men ran the
same way the records read before-
hand there wouldn’t be much purpose
in holding meets. They don't. Any-

thing is liable to happen in any ath-

letic event, and it does happen in
track. That’s what is bothering Carl
Olson.

WOODRUFF RUNS MILE

An explanation of the allotment
of points ﬁnds that Pitt’s maximum
in the mile run is six, with the mini-
mum set at ﬁve. Johnny Woodruﬁ’
will win, as he has done in every
meet this year. Harold Test is given
a third place in maximum calcula-
tions, but he will have a hard time
getting it. Frazier of the Army is a
sure second and either Spilman or
Lewis stand a good chance to beat
Tost out.

In the 440, Pi-tt is given a first in
m-axiemum reckoning, and a second
and third in minimum accounts. Be-
cause of’ the‘ Army order of events,
Woodruﬁ‘ will be unable to run. Art
Thomas is ﬁgured a ﬁrst and Alex
Leggi-n a third. Thomas will have more
than a. hard time in beating Galen
Eaton, a 49.7 second man. Eaton, if
not a winner, will place second.

Kel-sie Reaves is Army's best
sprinter. His best time is 10.2 sec-
onds. This affords-an opportunity for
a Panther sweep with Mason, Cooper,
and Spitz scoring. The 220 will be
little closer’. Reaves should be good
for either a second or a third.

RYDEN I"A=VORED IN HURDLES

Kenny Ryden, still bothered by
strain-ed muscle in his right leg, is
counted on for ﬁrsts in both hurdle
events. The uncertainty in these
events is in the other two places.
Dave Byars of the Army, a 15.7 man
in the highs, is ﬁgured to place sec-
ond in both. Andy Las-ky, who has
been in a slump for the past two
weeks, might gain a second in the
lows. Anyway, he will place third in
both.

The two mile run is an Army
event. Bob Hubbard ran the distance
in 9.37 against NYU last week and
is conceded ﬁrst place. Either Har-
old Test or Alex Zamborski will pick
up a second or third, possibly both.
The half mile run is all Woodruif.
Alex" Leggin is not given a second
place: over John Jaycox, a 1:58.3
runner.

The ﬁeld, which may be held ac-
countable for Pitt’s defeat last week,
will ﬁnd the Panthers in another un-
derdog position, with no hope in
view. Strong superiority on the track
will be the Panthers only salvation.

CADET VAULTERS BEST

Captain Dick Klocko and Charlie
Jackson are both 13 foot pole vault-
ers. The best that Pitt can hope for
is a third place by Clifton. The dis-
cus, with Monk Meyers throwing 134
feet, likewise belongs to the Army.
There is a possibility that Rags Rad-
vansky will gain a second but he is
bothered by fouls.

For the first time in his collegiate
competition, Gene Taa-no seems cer-
tain of defeat. In fact, he’ll be lucky
to place third. This event has been
a Panther point-getter in the meets
so far, and loss of points here is
likely to' be‘ serious. Taano will be
throwing against two men who have
already beaten him this year.

Kenneth Sanborn won the Penn
Relays javelin championship, displac-
ing Taano. His teammate, Al Clark,
placed third in the same meet. San-
born's winning distance was 213 feet,
.a mark Taano has never attained.

  
 

Friday, May 14, 1937

Meet

Clark also tosses the pole over 200
feet.

The two jumps are unknown quan-
tities. Pete Bennett should win the
high jump, but his exhibition last
week indicates everything else but a
Bennett win. The best Bennett could
do last week was 5 feet, 8 inches.
His big trouble is too much weight.
Possibly, Oden may be in his best
jumping form and gain a third place.
JUMPS UNCERTAIN

The broad jump is just about in
the same category. Ed Routch has
jumped far enough to be able to beat
Sherwood Buckland, but whether or
not he’ll do it is questionable.

Army showed signs of a powerful
outﬁt last Saturday when they dou-
bled the score on New York Univer-
sity. Pitt has won two and lost one

Greeks Begin
Play In Tourney
Sessions

Unless the highly-favored Dents
and Kappa Alpha Phi stumble against
underdogs tonight in the University
and Independent leagues, each will
win the championships of its re-
spective circuits. The Politicos face
the task of stopping the fast-moving
Dents and KAPhi finds the Buzzers
blocking its drive to the top.

Meanwhile, the fraternity tourna-
ment got off to a fast start Tuesday
night with the playing of four games.
Lambda Chi Alpha and the Phi Eps
came through the first two days of
play unscathed and were to play in
one semi-ﬁnal game last night.
LAMBDA CHIS WIN

Lambda Chi, with Ave Daniell toss-
ing them in, swamped" PiKA, 13-3,
Tuesday and found Bud Beachler’s of-
ferings just aseasy to hit in pound-
ing out a 12-4 decision over Kappa
Sig Wednesday. The Kappa Sigs had
previously won their way into the
secondvround by defeating Sigma Chi
16-7.

Phi Ep’ had a little easier path to
the semi-ﬁnals, drawing a bye in the
ﬁrst round and then defeating the
Delts, 10-8, Wednesday evening. In
their first round game, the Delts beat
Theta Chi, 5-2, after being held score-
less by pitcher’ Crippen for six in-
nings.

In the other bracket only first round
games were played with Phi Kappa
winning over SAE by a football score.
The count read as if the Phi Kaps
had scored four touchdowns to an
SAE safety but the boys were play-
ing mushball, the score must have
been 28 runs to 2 runs. Phi Gam was
to meet the Phi Kaps yesterday in a
second round game.

WOLVES TRIUMPH

The Phi Delts knocked over SAM,
6-4, behind Cashdol1ar’s tight pitch-
ing Tuesday and met the Pi Lambs
who drew a ﬁrst round bye yesterday.

The Wolves and Newman club
played the longest game of the season
Wednesday night, in the Independent
League, before the former pushed over
a run in the tenth inning to win the
ball game, 7-6. Jackman, Wolves’
pitcher, weathered a bad opening in-
ning in which the Newman's scored 3
runs and handcuffed the opposition
for the remaining nine innings. Mc-
Cance pitched well also, until some
ragged support by his teammates in
the last frame put him in a hole.

The threat of rain apparently
scared the Forty- Plussers away
Wednesday and as a result the Legal

Softies won this game on a forfeit.

Lewis Captures Four
Firsts, Team
Scores 86-40 Victory

There were plenty of races sched-

' uled on the program of events, but

the Pitt freshman track and ﬁeld
team won in a walk from Altoona
High School in the fourth meet held
between the two schools, 86-40.

Clarence Lewis, versatile Panther
yearling, was the.outstanding scorer
of the day, marking up 20 points to
his individual total with a sum of four
ﬁrst places. Lewis won the 100-yard
dash, the two hurdle events, and high
jump.

Johnny Bazyk, the ace freshman
weight, performer, gained his cus-
tomary two ﬁrst places by winning
the shot put and the discuss throw.
A second in the javelin gave him a
runner-up total of 13 points. Bazyk’s
heave of 56 feet, 21/2 inches in the
12-pound shot was the exceptional
performance of the day.

Frank Ohl, a member of the crack
freshman relay outﬁt, duplicated
Bazyk’s scoring accomplishments. Ohl,
featuring with a triumph in the 440-
yard clash, also placed ﬁrst in broad
jump with a leap of 21 feet, 71/;
inches. His second was in the 220-
yard run in which he ﬁnished behind
his teammate, Burns. _

McKee, the only man to beat Wood-
ruﬂ’ this year and that wa_s- after he‘
had received a 100-yard advantage,
won the half mile run with a’ time of
2203.6. Sterner, another Pitt man,
won the mile.

These ﬁrsts, together with Baily’s
pole vault win, gave the Panthers
ﬁrst place supremacy in every event
except the javelin and hammer throw.
Perhaps, from the inﬂuence of their
varsity colleagues, the freshman
showed their only weakness in the
ﬁeld, despite Bazyk.

Altoona is the state high school
champion. The Pitt victory gave the
Panthers a superiority in the series.
It now stands, Pitt two victories, one
defeat, and one tie.

Golfers Trouncc Tartans;

Meet Cornell, Penn

Revived somewhat from the ig-
nominy of last week-end in Washing-
ton, a Pitt golf team that does pack
strength away in its golf bags dis-
played some of that power Wednes-
day at the Alcoma Country Club
where they trounced Tech for the
second time this season by the iden-
tical score, 8-1, to win the city col-
legiate fairway championship.

All chances for titles in the Eastern
Collegiate Golf Conference Associa-
tion being lost in the rough, the Pitt
six will attempt to salvage their Con-
ference reputation today and tomor-
row at State College when it meets
the other two members of its division,
Penn State and Cornell.

If the Panther putters have one of
their good days, they should be able
to come through with both victories.
If, however, they run into a playing
week-end that they had one week ago
their chances are nil.

Penn State has already won two of

State

its Conference matches and has an
opportunity to make a show for the
Conference crown. Cornell is in hardly
better position than the Panthers.

In the Tech match Wednesday,
Souchak straightened his drives out
and trounced Nevin I-‘alley again, 5
and 4. His best ball partner, Frank
Bonoratti, continued the ﬁne golf he
has been playing all year and won his
third straight match, 4 and 3, from
Peter Wasco of Tech. Together, the
Pitt Franks acquired a best ball
point, 4 and 3.

Gridman Bill Daddio had a little
more trouble with Ted Haller, but
wiggled in ahead, 1 up. Tony Kay,
who has lost only one point this year
in competition, knocked over Tech's
Dable, 4 and 3. The best ball belonged
to the Pitt combine, 4 and 3.

Bob Baughman defeated Tartan
Hubbard, 5 and 4. The Pitt number
six man, Ed Lawry, lost 2 and 1 to
Daily, but the Pitt Team won the
best ball, 1 up.

wreck Pitt chances-
for anundefe-ated season as a meas-
ure of vindication for the Quaker
defeat. ' '  3

Last season, the Penn State match-
was also re-garded as one of the hard-‘
e'.:.:t on the scliedule, but Coach Dave
O’Loughlin’s proteges scored an easy
6-3 victory. Both the Pitt and State
teams that step on the courts are
almost t-he same, as last ’year’s.
Though Larry Blatt and Ad Hartman
will be playing instead of Joe Mad-
den and Ray Heckler of the 1936
tennis team, the Panther squad will
be just as strong tomorrow, as the
squad that toppled‘ the Lions last
year, 6-3. '

FRELSIIMEN OPEN

While the varsity travels to Penn
State, the freshman netters will make
their initial start against the Tartan
frosh, also on Saturday. The posi-
tions on the yearling ‘tennis team are
still undecided, but it is certain that
Joe Kristufek will play number one
and that Bll1‘Il:’~‘, Kaufman, and
Hogenroecler will be somewhere in
the starting lineup.

Kaufman, who holds the high
school singles. championship, and
Hogeni‘oe(lcr were the nucleus of the
Allderdice net squad which paced the
city liigh school ten-nis league last
year. They have been practising
daily on the Stadium courts.

 

Bob Madden

Joe Kristufek. who has been giving’ '

the varsity a lot of competition in
practise should have little trouble to-
morrow. Kristufek was run-ner up in
the city parks tournament and is one
of the outstanding‘ players in the city.

 

Women Tennis

Smashing their way to a complete
shutout over P.C.W. on Tuesday, the

be scheduled in two weeks. In the
meantime, games will be played with
Mt. Mercy next Tuesday and with
Duquesne on Wednesday, both on‘
the University courts.

The Pitt coed team which played

ical education instructors, who ranked
the players according to ability and
€‘..“pC1‘lClIL‘C. By today all tr_vouts for
positions on the all-University team

Dedication

Fosteriana—C;llection  

Donated By Lilly  

Mrs. Earhart, Stirred By

Criticism

Of Lecturer, Originated Idea For Memorial

To Celebrated Pittsburgh

Composer

By HARRISON CHANDLER _
To be dedicated in an elaborate two-day program June 1-2,
the stephen Foster Memorial, built at a cost of more than half

a million dollars, stands today

as the result of the inspiration

born in the mind of Mrs. Will Earhart in 1927 during her presi-
dency of the Tuesday Musical Club of Pittsburgh.

The shrine of the Memorial, hex-
agonal in shape and about 40 feet
in diameter, will house the Foster
Hall collection of Fosteriana——ad-
judged to be the most authentic and
valuable. of all Foster collections and
one of the most important musical
collections in the world. Consisting
of some 10,000 items, the collection
is the gift of Josiah K. Lilly of
Indianapolis.

The collection is composed of early
and modern editions of sheet music;
original letters; manuscripts; per-
sonal belongings of Foster; original
pictures and portraits in oil of the
composer; song books; and maga-
zines, together with an extensive
bibliography and miscellany. Each of
the itemshas been studied, indexed
and described. Every known song,
composition, and arrangement by
Stephen C. Foster is represented in
the collection.

ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT

Included in the collection is the
original bound manuscript book in-
scribed with Foster’s name in gold
letters, containing 220 pencil hand-
written verses of his creative efforts
between 1851 and 1860. Among
these are lyrics of “Old Folks At
Home,” “My Old Kentucky Home,”

“‘Massa’s in de Cold, -Cold Ground,”

and “Old Black Joe.” ,1

L Also included in the Fos-tcriana are
original correspondence of Foster
and his family, photographs, and his
personal effects, including his prayer-
book, his melodion, and the pocket-
book left in his clothes in New York
when he died.

Thirty-eight years old at his death,
Foster himself never even suspected
that his songs were to be world fa-
mous; he never dreamed of immor-
tality. Mrs. Earhart today, however,
with her hopes for the Memorial
crowned with success, is grateful for
Dr. Walter Damrosch’s accolade,
“You people in Pittsburgh are sav-
ing Foster for America.”

MRS. EARHART’S IDEA

Mrs. Earhart, wife of the super-
intendent of music in the city’s pub-
lic sch-ools, conceived the idea of the
memorial to Foster’s, genius after
hearing the criticism of a lecturer
who complained that no one could
direct him to Foster’s home or to his
grave in Pittsburgh.

The Tuesday Musical Club immedi-
ately accepted Mrs. Earhart’s idea
and soon, un-der her guidance the
far-reaching plan was under way,
beginning with a radio program on
the 34th anniversary of Foster’s
death, January 30, 1928. Within a
year cam-e requests from all over the
country for suggested programs.
Several years later, January 340 be-
came a national day in honor of
Stephen C. Foster.

: Some indication of the tremendous
national and international popularity
of Foster’s songs was brought home
to the musical club's ﬁnancial com-
mittee in the contributions received,
which came from all sections of the
country. Pittsburgh school children
raised $7,000 in a year through bene-
ﬁt programs of their own making.
Among the most generous contribu-
tors were the late Mrs. Oliver Hirsch-
man, the late R. B. Mellon, A. W.
Mellon and Josiah K. Lilly.

Chancellor John G. Bowman, quick
to realize the signiﬁcance of the
memorial, obtained the approval of
University officials in 1928 to grant
a building site for it on the Forbes
street side of the quadrangle near
the Cathedral. Dr. Bowman's action
gave the plan great impetus, as evi-
denced in securing in rapid succes-
sion the endorsement and cooperation
of the National Federation of Music
Clubs and the National Educational
Association.

Dr. Lunden Declares
Teaching ‘Secure’

Sociologist Publishes
Results Of Educational
Survey In Journal

By ROBERT GETTIG

Are you afraid you may lose
your job when Old Man Depression
comes around, and the boss begins to
ﬁgure ways and means of doing with-
out you on his payroll? If so——go
into college teaching, young man.

According, to assistant professor of

sociology, Dr. Walter A. Lunden,
writing in the current issue of the
“Journal of Higher Education,”

teachers in universities remain coin-
paratively unaffected by booms and
depressions.

Dr. Lunden’s article, entitled “Eco-
nomic Changes and Faculty Clizinges,”
contains the results of a survey made
of the teaching. staffs of four u1ii-
versities, four colleges, and four
technical schools in the United
States from 1900 to 1933. This data
was plotted, for purposes of com-
parison with the deviations of the
American Telephone and Telegraph
general business index covering the
same period.

The chart shows no uniform corre-
lation between the curves represent-
ing faculty and economic changes.
Only 52 per cent of the total num-
ber of cases show agreement, with
college faculties corresponding most
closely to business changes, and fac-
ulties of technical schools least. In
five signiﬁcant years, however, 1906,
1909,1916, 1921, and 1932 —- busi-
ness depression has resulted in seri-
ous damage to the faculties of all
three types of schools.

“Much depends,” says Dr. Lunden,
“on the duration and severity of the
business cycle as well as the char-
acter of the institution.” He goes
on to show that no prediction can
be made in individual cases, due to
SL1C:1 widely varying factors as size
and type of endowment, administra-
tive policy, private vs. state source of
funds, etc.

Summing up, Dr. Lunden says: “It
is evident that long and serious busi-
ness recessions generally precede de-
creases in faculty membership of
higher educational institutions . . .
liowe'\'er, changes which parallel the
economic cycle may be due to chance
or iion—ccoiioiiiic factors. Therefore,
no claini can be made for a constant
and unit'oi'in relationsliip between
busiiiess index and faciilty member-
ship, although a close correlation ap-
pears to exist in a number of cases.”
