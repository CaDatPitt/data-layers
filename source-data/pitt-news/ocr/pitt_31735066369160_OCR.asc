Changes in Election Code  

ByMIKEKANE

Pin News Staffwriter

‘ The Student Government Board

Wednesday approved changes in
the elections code proposed.by the
Student Government Elections
Committee. _ -
Among the approved elections
code changes, which include the

replacement of a single election A‘

committee chairman with co-
chairmen and the establishment of
committee alternate positions, is
the creation of ﬁve new polling
places for the upcoming elections
in January.

According to co-chairman Ellen
Wiest, the new locations will be the
Hillman Library, the Cafeteria exit,

“Burger Chef in the Cathedral of
%earning, -Uncle’ Charlie’s in the

Student Union and at the. Pitt
basketball game in the Field House
on January 25, 1979._ ,
The elections committee also
included in the code a provision
that prohibits the use of any,

student government ofﬁces for

campaign purposeswby any candi-

date or organization. _

Wiest announced that handouts
will be provided on the election
days Jan. 22-25‘, and will include a
photograph of each candidate and
the candidates’ views on five issues
the elections committee feels are
relevant to the student body. The
questions are:

1) What should the SGB’s
priorities be for the allocation of the
Activity Fees monies?

2) Deﬁne three major areas of
academic concern to undergrad-
uates and how you would approach

I these areas.

3) What additional services
should be provided by the
University? by Student Govern-
ment? What existing services need
to be improved and how?

4) What speciﬁc things should
Student Government do to improve

the quality of life of commuter -

students? —

5) Realistically, what effect can
Student Governmenthave on the
lives of Pitt students?

The student government office
reported that, unofﬁcially, some 25
petitions for board president or
general board positions have been
filed. ,

At the top of the meeting, board
president Joshua Baylson com-
mented on an editorial in Wednes-
day’s The Pitt News, in which
Baylson’s and board ‘member Dave

_Hesidence’s absence from an-’

alleged board meeting with the Pitt‘
Out of South Africa Coalition was
called “disrespectful”,_“ and
“nothing less than an insult” to the
group.

“The editorial used a couple of
premises that are inconclusive and
unfounded. The ﬁrst is that Pitt
Out of _South Africa is a recognized
student group. We offered to‘
perhaps suspend the bylaws to
make them a recognized group, but

SGB presidn Josh ayon said at Wednesday’s meeting that the accuse-‘I

tions made in a last Pitt News editorial concerning his absence from a meeting

with the Anti-imperialist Student Union were “disrespectful” and “nothing ‘

less than an insult.”

CAS Council Discusses Part-’rimeS,’rucly Plan
' By SUE  '

Wednesday’s meeting, but
failed to reach any decision on the
matter.

Irwin Schulman, Dean of the
College of~Arts and Sciences, said
the issue of part-time study can be
subdivided into three questions.
The ~ first question concerns.
whether the present student body
should be permitted to participate
in part-time study.

_ The second question is whether

recruitment efforts should be taken
to bring older,‘ middle-aged stu-
dentsto the college for part-time
study, The third point‘raised by
Schulman covers a proposal to
expand the School -of. General
Studies to include’ daytime classes.

Schulman voiced objections to
the admission of SGS students to
daytime CAS classes. His
objections were based ‘on the
admissions process of the two
schools. ‘

Prospective CAS students are
subjected to an’ admissions process
while there are no requirements set
forth for the admission of a student
to SGS classes.

Schulman- said that he was
concerned with what affect -admis-
sion of SGS students into these
courses on apart-time basis might
have on the present liberal arts
curriculum.

“I’m not at allenthused about
diluting the liberal arts program for
the- sake of the SGS program,”
Schulman said. '

‘Dr. John Townsend, associate .

professor of physics, defended the
School of General Studies students.

/

“If School of General Studies
students are admitted on a
part-time basis to day classes I
don't see this as a watering down
process,” Townsend said. “I’ve
had SGS students who have been
away from school for years and
have been working, but these
students have been some of the
most highly motivated and delight-
ful students that I’ve ever had.”

At it's meeting next week the
council hopes to take some action
on the issue of part-time study.

Schulman discussed the schedul-
ing of ﬁnals during the last week of
classes. There is a College of Arts

and Sciences ruling stating that a

faculty are not permitted to‘
schedule ﬁnals during the last
week of regular classes.

“Some faculty consider a major-. .

. ity vote of the students a license to

schedule ﬁnals during this week .

but I certainly don’t,” Schulman
concluded. _

.In other business,\a proposed
major in applied mathematics was
presented by several members of
the mathematics department.

‘Professors Harold Cohen, James

Fink, and Mario Benedicty pre-
sented the major that according to
Fink, is three fold.

He said the new major 'would be
aimed at cultivating new attitudes

about applied mathematics, while

creating a vast body of creative
knowledge on the subject. It would
also help to develop speciﬁc talents
in the area of applied mathematics.

The representatives of the math
department all agreed that institu-
tion‘ of such a major would
deﬁnitely act to .boost enrollments

~ in -the department because of its’
attractiveness. ' . .

some move by Congress to institute
a tax credit bill. One type of tax
credit bill, the tuition advance
fund, is receiving some support
from Congressmen, according to
Moye.

The tuition advance fund would
give funds to students while in
college and then require the
students to repay the funds
through an automatic payment
made. every year when they file
their "income tax claims. In effect,
the advance fund would make
student, and not their parents,
responsible for paying for the
college education.

Moye said he personally opposed
the tuition advance fund because it
might discourage many poor from
seeking a college education. He
said that many poor students,
would not enter college, threatened
by the possibility of a large debt
afterwards incurred through tuition
advance fund. '

“The last thing a poor person
wants is to look at more debts,”
Moye said. .

Moye said that the
program,” actually a set of four
programs to help students who
have. not received an adequate
academic background in high
school, is being ‘used by the
Department of Health, Education
and Welfare.

'. Upward Bound, the first of the
programs, brings students to
college. and university campuses
and places them in a college
learning situation to familiarize
them with higher education. The
second program, the talent search
program, is used to identify
students who have academic
potential and counsel them on

admissions to colleges and univer-.

sities.

“We use non-conventional’

methods to identify these stu-
dents,” Moye said. He said that
ministers, teachers and counselors
are consulted to find students who

“‘areas of high national need”

where they have not been included
traditionally.
“For the ﬁrst time, we are taking

' a broad and general look at the

graduate level,” Moye said.
Mathematics, bio-chemistry, en-
gineering and business are some of
the areas where graduate students
have been given fellowships under
the new program. ’
Continuing education and coop-
erative education are two areas that
the government must emphasize in
the future, Moye said. He stated
that the government must work
with private groups to try to use

Thornburg Returns to Harrisburg‘

For Fund -raising Victory Dinner  

By The Associated Press

HARRISBURG—Governor-elect
Richard L. Thomburgh returned to
Harrisburg Thursday for the ﬁrst
time since his election for a round
of appearances and a fund-raising

p victory dinner.

More than 1,000 persons, in-
cluding, U.S. Sens. Richard
Schweiker and John Heinz IH, were
expected to attend the $100-a-plate
celebration, _

Earlier in the day, Thomburgh
made brief remarks before the
state Association of County Com-
missioners and the Govemor’s
Small Business Advisory Council.

is con- "

for his cabinet and other high state

‘ positions.

“We are working hard _to
canvass Pennsylvania,” he said.
“We will continue until we’re
satisﬁed we’ve gotten the best we
can.”

Thomburgh said he hopes to
have “a pretty ﬁrm feel about the
cabinet by the end of the month.”
But he said he doesn’t know how
soon before the_Jan. 16 inaugura-
tion he will announce his selec-
tions. ‘

‘ Although slow and methodical,

his approach'will be the best to ﬁnd
the kind of talent needed to run the
state, he said. '

Asked about Senate Majority
Leader Edward Zemprelli’s recent
comments that some‘ senators
would like_ to see a number of
incumbent cabinet members “re-
tained, Thornburgh said he didn’t
expect he’d have to ﬁ ht the

nominees.

“I hope we don’t start off once
again in a partisan posture,” he
said, referring to the ﬁght over
cabinet members four years ago
between Gov. Milton Shapp and
the Senate.

“I spoke with Zemprelli and he
assured me .that he would not
promote -obstructionist tactics in
moving the administration’s pro-
grams forward,” Thornburgh said.
“I assumed he included cabinet
members... '

“We ’re looking for the very best

’ people we can,” Thomburgh said.
“We’re not going to rule out
people for -service in this admin-
istration because of party afﬁlia-
tion,” he said. '

Thomburgh was asked about
reports that his transition team was
pinpointing jobs that aren’t pro-
tected by civil. service or the

out the Camp David Summit
agreements‘, “not grudgingly, but
enthusiastically. ”

Carter discussed the treaty
delays with reporters at avWhit-e
House breakfast" and then told

, Israeli Ambassador Simcha Dinitz

in an Oval Office meeting that “any
violation of this very solemn date
that was agreed to at Camp David
would be a serious precedent to set
for the future.”

Dinitz replied during a brief I

photo session that he agreed “100
percent” and said, “I think time
doesn’t work for peace.”

The ambassador told reporters

after the 30-minute meeting—an- '

nounced as a last-minute addition
to Carter's schedule-'—that he
avoided naming Egypt as the cause
for" the delay’ because he didn’t
want-to upset negotiations. Then
he added: ' “I can only tell you it’s
not Israel.” _

fast meeting, one of a series.the

Carter also: “ -

Revamping
The SGB,
Constitution

The constitutional review committee of the
Student Government Board is now starting to wind
up a campaign to suggest some changes in the con-
stitution for the Student Government of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh. The committee has already sent
letters to all student organizations asking for
suggestions and plans to meet at the beginning of
winter term to try to discover how the constitution
should be revamped. . ‘

According to Dave Hesidence of the SGB, the only
change discussed so far is a change in the structure of
the constitution’s wording in order to make it a true
constitution and not a list of bylaws. While this is
one commendable step, there are other sections of

the constitution that should be closely scrutinized by

the review committee.

The budget procedures for funding student
organizations is one area that is in serious need of
revamping. As the allocations procedure works now,’
the visibility of the steps that lead to the final funding
of student organizations at Pitt is minimal.
Although the hearings on allocations are open to the
public and all student organizations can argue the
validity of their allocations requests, there are several
features of ’the budget procedures. that keep most
students ignorant of the machinations that culminate
in the expenditure of their student activities fee.

The first feature is the time of year when the
allocations hearings are held. Traditionally, the bulk
of the hearings are held during the spring when the
majority of students are not at school. The problems.
the date of ’the proceedings created were obvious
during the hearings this spring. Many representatives
of student organizations failed to appear, apparently
because there were no members of the organizations
attending school during the spring session. Many of
the representatives who did appear were ill.-prepared
to defend their appropriations requests for the same
reason. _

The second problem. with the allocations
proceedings is. the general inavailability of infor-
mation about the requests of student organizations

and the suggested budgets that the allocations com-' 

mittee submit to the board. The SGB does not report
publicly the allocations to the student organizations
until the allocations have been approved already.

This makes it impossible for students to discover
how student government is planning to spend funds
from the activities fee unless they go to the trouble of
filing through the allocations requests of every single
organization. Such an arrangement makes it im-
possible for students to watch the allocations process
while it is in progress and react to the plans the SGB
has for students’ money.

To correct these problems, the review committee
should take a number of steps to restructure the
allocations procedures. The first step should be
requiring that the fiscal year for the SGB run from
November 1 to November 1. This move would mean
allocations hearings would be held in September, in-
stead of. the spring when few students are on-campus.
_‘ The second step’ would be to require that the
budget requests of all student organizations and the
allocations committee’s suggested allocations for all
student groups be published before any hearings are
held. This step‘is crucial _if students are to have
proper input into the way the .money they pay in ac-
tivities fees is spent. - A

before Christmas.‘

ments when their sanity is at stake.

I ’By HARRISON STACKPOLE

Usually around Christmas time,
the editorial page has some

_moralistic piece written by some

moralistic journalist explaining

how it really is a shame that the
-Christmas season has become a
commercial venture and how it's

not really supposed to be that way
and why don’t we go back to the old
days and go ride in a sleigh and
give the kiddies a stocking full of

‘ fruit.

Well, this column is not going to
be about that for the simple reason
that:

—I’m a total capitalist who

believes the idea ofa commercial

venture is one of the vital staples of
our economy (I don’t see how
commercialism is really that bad
anyway).

—-Going on a sleigh ride and
freezing your bucket off is a really
stupid idea (unless somebody that
you are fond of wants to go along
with you and keep you warm).

——If my parents ever gave me a‘
stocking full of fruit, nuts, and
candy I would throw it at them. I
want a sports car. '

No, I'm not going to get -down on
any of that trivial nonsense this
year. This year I’m going to
criticize something near and dear
to all of us—report cards and why
most of us have the pleasure of
getting the damn things the clay

Isn’t it enough that we suffer

through the agony and premature.
gray of ﬁnal examinations? Isn’t it‘

enough that _most of us eat the
cafeteria food? Isn’t it enough that
we lost to Penn State in football
again? After all of this, what do
they give us to look forward to but
the total indigestion of having to
face your parents the day before
Christmas and explaining to them
that you got a D in logic because
you didn’t go to all of your classes,
broke up with your girlfriend and
joined afraternity. Then you have
to apologize. to them and ask in a
very sincere and meek voice,
“Does this mean I’m not going to
get the stereo I wanted?”

COURSE

———-———'_"’—.f——-_—-———'-
EVALUATION

    

It is relatively obvious to me that
the University psychology depart-
ment is using us as guinea pigs in a
stress experiment to see how
much we can take. Either that, or

there are a few people with a sick"

sense of humor at this place.
“Hey Frank, look at this one.

Three C’s, a D, and two F’s. Let’s
make sure this kid gets his on the

twenty-third. ’ ’ g
“Sounds good to me, Joe.”
Putting the shoe on the other

foot, however, it is also worth

noting the date when you get a

good report card.

“But Mom, why can’t I go out
drinking with the guys tonight? I
got two A’s and three B’s?"

“That’s what you said the last
time when you brought home four
C’s and a D.”

When you finally do get your
report card (December 30) it is too
late to do anything except come
back to school and blow off the first
two weeks making up for what you
missed at home.

Something has to be done about
this grave injustice! How can you
expect the student body to worry
about such issues as PUPC or the
divestiture of South African invest-

\

I mean, if we are going to revolt
about something around here, let’s
protest‘ something that is really
pertinent to us.

How can we get even with the .

University? I wish we could give
them a lump of coal,_ but that really
isn't a mature solution to the
problem. We could always take
over the chancellor’s office and
demand our rights, but somehow I
don’t think the University police (or
Chancellor Posvar) would be too
responsive in that situation. Join-
ing the French Foreign’Legion is
always an idea, albeit a bit too
drastic (and strenous for my
tastes).

There aren’t really too many’

reasonable solutions to the report
card dilemma. _The best thing that
I do is take it out on my family’s 100
lb. german shepherd by getting

-him drunk on spiked eggnog. I

realize that it isn’t really a very
bright thing to do, but thedog
seems to enjoy it. Anway,
whatever you do, don’t let it get
you down. It could be worse. You
might be forced to transfer to
Duquesne or West Virginia. Merry
Christmas. '

UFO Lands at Arena With Driving Rock ’n ’Roll

Schenker, a German guitarist
who had been with the band since
1974, recently left the band under
mysterious circumstances.

This recent departure, explained
b Schenker’s alleged inability to

keep up with UFO’s heavy road
pace, has led the way for the
Welshman Chapman to take over
the lead guitar spot permanently.

Chapman capably ﬁlled his spot
with his own style. Schenker was a

new guitarist who replaced talented but controversial Michael Schenkerisecond from left) last week-

common to many artists-—getting
into a musical rut. > “Time
Passages” is musically and lyrical-
ly refreshing.

It opens with the title cut and
introduces a concept that is further
detailed by the following cuts. This
keyboard-based song tells of the
acceptability, on occasion, of
reaching into our pasts for
whatever purpose. Whatever one
finds, though, one will experience
it alone. .

It is important to be able to leave
the past for progressive change and

growth. Judging from its recent’

airplay, “Time Passages” deser-
vedly should be considered a hit.
The next cut is “Valentina
Way,” providing Stewart’s own
style» of rock’n’roll. It succeeds
because of straight-forwardness
and catchy singing. It reiterates
the need for a changed life
following a shattered romance.
Side I finishes with‘ “A Man for
All Seasons,” a sort of Billy
Joel-like song about gods, Jeho-

vahs, Allahs and places like
Valhalla that are “lost behind the
sun.” _ '

guitar by Tim Renwick and various
percussion by Arthur Trip III and

» Lindsey and Stuart Elliot. Lucy is a

prostitute who gets away from it all
by moving to California. Stewart’s
message here, if he intends one, is
foggy.

g “Palace of Versailles” follows as
a slow, gentle song, featuring
synthesiser rhythym by Pete
Solley. , _

There are still places we can go
where time seems to stand still, as

Stewart portrays of the Arcadian"

skies in “Timeless Skies."

Phil Kenzie’s blasting alto sax
opens “Song on the Radio,”
similar in radio status to “Time
Passages.” Kenzie skillfully
continues to highlight the song

about two people collecting
moments together.
The album closes with an

riately enough, “End of the Day.”
The album’s nine K songs are

Such quality can be attributed to

well as competent musicians. .

Chapman filled in many of the
band’s songs and made them a bit‘
more lyrical with his sinewy blues
runs.

His work on “Love to Love,”

‘ ‘ Mother Marv, ” “Doctor, Doctor”

and “Natural Thing," was out-

standing, but on the
showcase tune, “Rock Bottom,”
the absence of Schenker’s lightn-

ing-like playing could be detected. .

However, UFO has never been
an act which spotlighted just one
member. The band is as tight and
energetic a rock band as there is in
the business, and they know their
craft well.

The band had no exploding‘
signs, smoke bombs, fire ﬂashes or
levitating drumkits—_-just a good
rigging of lights, their music and
unbeatable stage charisma.

Mogg had a white sportcoat on

over a" T-shirt and tie, stripping " ’
down to just the tie when his vocals 

started to get hot at the end, with
songs such as “Lights Out. ’ Let

co-wrote _ “Time Passages” and
“End of the Day" with Stewart)

sophisticated and poetic around.

  Talking to Rock Stars -- Nice Guys Still Exist

By M‘. PATRICK MONAHAN
Pitt News Siaffwriicr

This is the final installment of a three-part article on
interviewing rock stars.

This column will provide insight into some of rock 5
-former big names, currently popular performers and
emerging groups on whose shoulders the creative weight of
.rock’n’roll must be carried if disco is to be kept from taking
over the airwaves completely. . . .

Black Sabbath: Although media critics and radio
program directors have sent this four-man group from
Birmingham, England. to the commercial graveyard by

refusing to play the band's aggressive brand of rock.‘

Sabbath mysteriously remains a popular concert draw.
I've interviewed these guys twice in the past and enjoyed
both encounters immensely.
All four are from poor. working-class backgrounds yet
have easily come to terms with their immense wealth.
’ Lead singer Ozzy Osbourne amazed me when we sat
_ down and started talking actual money figures about
', Sabbath’s unbelievable concert grosses.
When interviewedjn September, he told me about future
I_. dates in Anaheim Stadium with audiences of 55,000 for two
consecutive nights. The band expected to‘ gross more than

Uriah Heep: This veteran British rock group has been
hitting the commercial skids recently but has remained
enthusiastic about its fans and music.

The manager, Chris Healey, stands out as a fine
gentleman and could serve as a prototype for the typical
British manager.

Bob Seger: When I interviewed Seger in 1977, he was
just about to burst into national prominence with increased
concert popularity and the success of his triple platinum
album. “Night Moves." .

Seger could be described as a nice guy, cooperative and
friendly.

You feel good when someone as nice 7 oeger, who paid
dues for years before finally cracking/the bigtime, finally
makes it . Besides being a great guy, he is'als_o one of the
most talented singer-songwriters in the .music business
today. . ' '

Aerosmith: The group is one of the most popular and
wealthy of the American rock bands.

Somehow it has developed a reputation for surliness in
interview situations, but the bad boys from Boston seemed
to be on good behavior at a recent press party preceding
their sold-out Arenaconcert.

Lead vocalist Steve Tyler and Joe Perry rate aces. They

took the time to talk to kids from junior, high school papers
besides ﬁelding questions from the large group of
professional media.

Blue Oyster Cult: This five-man groilp from Long Island,
N.Y., has a rather imposing leather and metal rocker

_ image. In reality, the members are normal and articulate.

Bassist Joe Bouchard talked about how the band got
together when all the members were in college.

Thin Lizzy: The leader of this four-piece Irish band,
bassist-singer Phil Lynott, is one of the more interesting
rockers l’ve met. A

Lynott is interested in’ not only the fortunes of Thin Lizzy,
but Irish culture and Celtic history. He even has made
documentary films on both topics for the British
Broadcasting Company.

Van Halen: This band revolves around two Dutch
brothers. Edward and Alex Van Halen, who immigrated to
Hollywood 10 Years ago. Watch for them to emerge as
superstars very soon. "

All members.are under 22 and, their debut release.
‘ Van Halen," is already a platinum album while being
produced for the ridiculously low sum.of $54,000.

Onstage. the group was unbelievably energetic. as it‘
drove the Arena crowd frantic with its heavy rock 'n' roll.

* a half a million dollars for the two 90-minute performances. _

In’ less than one month, people-
from all over the world will be
celebrating Christmas, a time for joy
and festivities. These celebrations
take different forms, and at Pitt these
native traditional customs are brought
to life in the 18 Nationality Rooms.

Earlier this month, the‘ Nationality

‘ Fiooms were decorated in traditional

styles by Nationality Fio'om- Commit-
tee members. who began the day
with ‘a luncheon in the Stephen
Foster Memorial where “Christmas in
Rumania” was described. Following
the luncheon, the Committee
decorated iits rooms while a
musician wandered around the
Commons Room playing Christmas
carols with Scottish bagpipes. _
The Christmas tree originated in
Germany, but the’ custom ‘ spread
throughout Europe. Trees were in-
troduced into Slovakia during the
1700s, and carried on the earlier

Slovak custom of bringing green_ '-

branches into the home to represent
the germination of new life. Trees
were decorated with natural things
such as nuts, figs, fruits and

homemade candies. For the Czechs

and Slovaks of years past (and
present), the climax of. the holiday
season was the ‘Stedry Vecer’ or
‘Bountiful Evening of Christmas Eve,’
when the entire family joined
together foria meal to signify their
unity and to give thanks for the past
year.

The Christmas tree became

‘' -popular in England during the reign of

Queen Victoria. German Prince
Albert, the Queen’s Consort, presen-
teda tree decked with wrapped
boxes of’ gifts and sweets, silver
sugar plum baskets and glittering or-
naments to the Queen and royal
family in 1841 . The Christmas tree's
popularity was assured when the
“lllustrated London News" carried a-
description of the traditional royal
tree in 1848.

The ancient practice of decking

githe halls with holly, ivy, and other
" greens, is still practiced in England.

The purpose of this was to dispel the
darkness of the long days of winter.
Hanging mistletoe, a custom
stemming from Druid ceremonies, is
among the oldest of all English
holiday customs.

The English have developed an in-
teresting Christmas custom since
World War II.
Norway was occupied, free Nor-

tygwegian forces made it a point each

year to slip through German coastal
patrols to secure a Nonivegian tree as
a gift for the exiled King Haakon.

Since World War II, the people of
Oslo, Nonivay, have sent a huge

set up, lighted and decorated with

much ceremony in Trafalgar Square.
It is a token of Norway’s appreciation_

‘ for G'reat~Britain’s cooperation during‘

the war.’
in Norway, candles are a large part

‘of the Christmas celebrations-—

especially on Christmas Eve ,when it
is believed that the rays of the candl_e
bestow a blessing wherever they fall.
' The Norwegian tree is decorated
with rows of tiny flagsu Small or-

namental mushrooms are also placed

on it. According to Norwegian
folklore, elves live under the
mushrooms and help in the

distribution of gifts. On Christmas
Eve, rice pudding is placed in the
barn for the Jule Nissen, the elves, so
that they will look‘ after the children
for the coming year. ’ ~
The creche is the center of the
Christmas decorations in France.
Christmas there is mainly a religious

celebration and a family holiday. The '

creche, or miniature Nativity scene, is
often prepared by the children. In
some parts of France, children still
observe the old custom of placing
their sabots, or wooden shoes, in
front of the hearth for_ the Christ Child
to fill.

Mystery plays commonly were

performed during the Middle Ages.

‘One play in particu|ar—the Paradise’
Play—_—was popular during the Christ-I

mas season. This play dramatized.
the life of Adam and Eve. The‘
evergreen, symbol of immortality was

an ever-presentprop. It was

decorated with apples to remind the

audience of the fall of man from

grace.

The popularity of the plays grew
as they became more wordly in ac-
tion. Eventually, the religious aspec-
ts of the mystery plays were over-

Fries photo

shadowed by humor and rough
language. The Churci‘. finally aban-
doned them, butithe German "and
French peasants did not abandon the
decorated tree.

According to German folklore, St.
Boniface is believed responsible
for the Christmas tree which served
as a symbol of celebration. Around

700 A.D., St. Boniface stopped a ‘

pagan chieftain from sacrificing his
son, then, with one blow ofan ax,
felled a massive oak that was the
scene of the ceremony. He then
pointed to a nearby evergreen which
he said stood for peace.

The Germantree is decorated with

‘gingerbread men, pfefferneuse,

anise cookies and nuts. Edibles on a
tree are very popular in European
countries. Candles, which
traditionally are lit on Christmas Eve,

-also decorate the tree. .Tiese ' are 4

The Greek Boom is decorated with

a traditional icon and -po e\as.
The Hungarian tree is decorated

with candy-filled cornucopias, other’ ’

candy decorations, (ﬁandles and
cookies.

The Irish Room, decked in holly

and branches of evergreen, is-a 4’

delight with its pungent pine aroma. it

is traditional to place a candle in the '

window. The ceremony of lighting

the candles is a simple.,ancient ritual, 

wherein prayers are said for the
departed. The privilege of striking
the match is usually given to a
daughter named Mary. The candle is
meant to welcome any passing
stranger or traveller.

‘The manger scene, which em-
phasizes the meaning of Christmas.
was made popular by ‘a bearded
monk better known as Saint Francis.
of Assisi. In the village of Greccio in
1223, he arranged a manger with.
hay and used live animals and
‘villagers to recreate the first Nativity
scene. Often, the manger scene
which is laid out in shape of a triangle,
is the base‘for the ceppo, a light
wooden frame arranged as a pyramid.

Usually, there are several shelves

above the presepio,_ or manger’ ‘

scene, which are decorated with
pieces of fruit, colored paper and
pine cones. . The ceppo, as seen in
the Italian Classroom, is in the

'\ . ..

tradition of Italy's Tree of Light,which .-

became theChristmas tree in other
countries. 1

In the center of the table in the
Polish Classroom is a small tray of
pieces of Oplatki, unleavened
wafers. When’ the Christmas Eve
meal is served, the Oplatki is eaten by
members of the family. This breaking
of the bread symbolizes peace" and
friendship. '

Peace is the theme for all the 1

rooms. Each committee, through its
decoration of the Nationality Rooms,
has made it possible for students to
enjoy the simple aspects of Christ'-
mas, as seen through traditional

~ customs. '

‘ FGBSOTIS.

By SHARON CI-IERNICK

I was amazed at how quickly I’d
gotten the job. When I went down to
apply for an office job at Armco Steel
Corporation (now Armco, Inc.) in

, "September 1973, I didn’t really ex-

._ pect to be hired. After all, I had only
. minimal office skills. Really pushing, I
v could type 40 w.p.m.

I could file,
though, and am a fast learner. I didn’t
think any office procedure would be

I too difficult to master. '

At the time, I was doing clerical

7, work at Dianna Shops, a -women’s

clothing store in Butler. I handled

‘money, filled out the daily cash

report, and did credit dunning. I
wasn't~happy at this job for many’
The pay was below
minimum wage, the work was boring
and unrewarding, there were no
benefits, and Mrs. -Ashbaugh, my
boss, was mean and difficult to work
with. I had to get out of. there, so I
decided to try Armco.

Toward the end of my interview on

I that September day, Armco’s per-

sonnel manager, Hal Hamilton, asked
me what seemed to be a peculiar
question: “Would you ever consider
working inside the mill, Sharon?"

Thinking that a negative answer
would hurt my chances of being
hired, I said yes, feeling sure he

‘didn’t really mean it.

I was surprised and elated when,

two weeks later, I got a call to come

down to the mill for a_physicaI
examination. I took the physical, writ-
ten test and a co-ordination

test—something that seemed odd for _

a potential secretary to take. It
wasn't until I was being fitted fo_r

safety shoes, safety glasses and a ,

hard hat that I got the idea I wasn't
being hired as a secretary. The an‘-
swer I received to my shakily put
question confirmed the" suspicion.
Along with three other women, I had
been hired as one of Armco"s first
female millworkers since World War
II.

I wasn't sure how to handle this
dubious honor. When I finally got
over the shock and my head cleared,
I began to deal with my doubts. What
kind of work would I be doing? would
I like the work? Would I be able to
handle it? What would people think of
me as a millworker?

Looking back, I suppose I could
have declined the job, thanked them,
and breathed a sigh of relief as I
walked out the door. But I didn’t think
I could get out of the situation without
losing face. I had said “yes, I would
work in the mill" at mv interview. The

benefits and pay ($6.50 an hour to
start) that Armco offered were much
better than those offered by the
Dianna Shops, and I really didn't feel
like listening one more day to Mrs.
Ashbaugh screaming at me because I
was a penny off in the cash report.
My first day of work was uneven-
tful. With a man whose name
escapes me, I stacked boxes of

computer cards in a little annex next
the the office area. The job only took

one-and-a-half hours, which left mé‘ I

six-and-a-half hours to_ sit and recover
from lugging the 50-pound boxes.
Although I felt terribly guilty for sitting,

' (after all, I was earning $6.50 an hour

and should have been _‘doing 9-

something) I learned it was a common
and unofficially sanctioned practice.
Most of the jobs I did in the mill (such

A as shoveling, painting, sweeping and

banding coils) oon’t require eight full
hours ofwork. In time, I was able to
relax, and learned to loaf effectively.
After that one-day grace period, I
was inducted into the mill proper. It's
an ungodly place. Dirty, noisy,
screaming hot in the summer and
stabbing cold in the winter. Many of
the men insisted that the innards of a
steel mill are no fit place for a woman.
I believe that it isn't a fit place for a
man either. ’ _ .
Hal Hamilton had taken Barb, Nan-
cy and me (Helen, the fourth woman,
had declined the job for medical

reasons) on a tour- of the mill before .

we started working. , The drabness
was evident everywhere, from the

‘soot-covered windows and mucky air

to the institutional green and blue
walls coated with a permanent layer

of steel-gray dust. The only bright
spots in the mill were glossy, full-
color centerfolds of nude, bosomy
‘‘ladies'’ who easily put Dolly Parton
to shame. They were plastered on

the walls of the lunchrooms, but had.

mysteriously disappeared by the time‘
we finished our tour.

Most of the_men, I found, didn’t
know how to deal with our presence
in the mill. Should they treat us like
“one of the guys” or should they treat

  
   

 

I like_"‘ladies,” even though the un-

voiced concensus was that no _“lady”
would be working in a steel mill?
Most of the men tried to be respec-

tful, removing offensive pictures and

apologizing, guiltily whenever they
swore. g ‘
A lot ofthe older men I worked
with took a mother-hen attitude
toward me, especially my Uncle Aya,
who is a boss with one of the la_bor

crews. ~Whenever we had to do.

heavy work, he refused to let me do
my share. This attitude was shared

by many other bosses and crews I .

worked with. At first, I appreciated
the break. . -

After overhearing some of the I.

guys express resentment, however, I
began to realize that it wasn't fair to
accept special consideration.’
Because the federal government had
pressured mills to hire women and
minorities, my job was secure no mat-
ter what I did—but that was no reason
to take advantage of the situation.

From then on, I insisted on doing my

share. The respect I earned from the
men, as well as the growth in my self-
esteem, was worth it.

Nancy, 35, felt the same way as I

did. She was divorced and had a 10-
year-old daughter named Beverly.
Nancy also worked hard, earning the
respect of the men. She even ended
up marrying one of the labor bosses,
Charley Stuart. Barb, '27, didn’t ap-
preciate the seriousness of our
position. We were the only women in
the mill for a year, and the hiring of
other women depended on (how well
we performed. ,

I still feel anger toward Barb for the

   

I manor;

way she" acted in the mill. Although

she was married and had three

children, Barb openly began to date a‘

married truckdriver named Ray. She
didn’t care that her blatant behavior
caused a lot of negative comments.

Barb’s behavior didn’t affect the
hiring of other women though. When I
went backto the mill this summer, it
was a nice surprise to find 20 women
working there. By the time I left the
mill, the total had risen to 50.

It wasn't easy for me to relate to.

the men in the mill. I suspect that
before we women came in, most of
the men had been sternly warned not
to bother us. "At first, the men
seemed afraid even to talk to me."
Once they thawed _out, we talked
about topics relating to the mill only.

After a while, I got to know some of

the guys on a personal level. Today, ‘I

the men expressed resentment.

the mill, mainly because they couldn't
handle the work—which was no more

was.the smallest of the three women
(5’ 1 1/2"), and they would cite me
as an example, not noticing that some
of the men were also my size.
Another complaint was that we
were taking jobs away from men.
Men came‘up to me and asked point
blank: “What are you trying to prove?
Are you a women’s libber or
something?” They didn’t seen to un-
derstand when I explained, “No, but a
woman should have the right to‘ earn
her own living, whether she is a
millworker or a waitress.”
The wives of many of the men

were uneasy about the presence of
women in the mill. They thought we.

were there “looking for a- man,” and ‘

felt -threatened. Of course, with‘
Barb's behavior _as an example, I
couldn't blame them for thinking
some hanky-panky was going on.
Of the two main mills in Butler,
Pullman and Armco, -I was much more
fortunate to be working at Armco.
Pullman paid more, but Armcohas an
unparalleled safety record. The
company provides steel-toed safety
shoes, shatterproof safety glasses
and hard hats. New workers have to

attend a safety orientation. Monthly
departmental safety meetings are
held. _

I learned how‘ seriously Armco

1‘ takes safety in an incident that oc-

cured a few months after I started

work. I had scraped my knuckle on

theledge below my locker one day
while dressing for work, causing it to
bleed a little. I knew I'd be shoveling
dirty, wet slag that day and wanted to
protect my finger, so I went to the
nurse's office for a simple Band-Aid.

The nurse took one look at my ‘inger
and proceeded to write up an ac-
cident report. She bandaged my
finger so thoroughly that when she
finished, it looked as if I'd broken it.

When I got to my department, my
crew boss had, a “little safety talk’’
with me. The department head
checked with me to make sure
everything was all right. Finally, I was

. “read the riot act” from the head of

the safety department. Perhaps the
concern stemmed from the fact that I
was the first woman to have an “ac-
cide_rlt," but after that I carried my
own Band~Aids. -

Because most of the mill work was
boring and uncreative, the men would

Goose-ing (playing tricks), was com-
mon. '

When it came to goose-ing, I was
counted as “one of the guys.” I
dished it out, too. One day, after I'd
gone through a week of playing victim
to a bunch. of. practical jokers, I
decided to bake the guys some cup-
cakes. Not as. a reward, but as
revenge. I had dropped loads of
crushed eggshells in the batter,
leaving one cupcake plain. -I planned

to eat this cupcake in ‘front of my co- .

worker, Leo Rocco, to throw him off
guard. But the joke backfired. When
I brought the cupcakes Leo
mistakenly got the good one. As I
chomped on a cupcake full of
eggshells, I decided to give up trying

‘ tovget back at him. Itjust wasn't wor-
th it. , ~ ,
Another way -the men amused

themselves was by cool_<ing._ Who
would suspect that a gourmet center

existed in the mill? It did in one sec- -

tion of the slab mill. There were four
large ‘soaking pits, in which ingots
were heated until they were hot
enough to roll. The tops of the pits
were covered with sand that became

the pits was -so high. So the men

buried pans and pots of food in -the /

and a.u_|l.lSt1l'lg rapidly,” said head
coach Dick Bradshaw. “From now
on, we’re interested in showing up
as a national championship team.”

Bradshaw has confidence as the
team prepares for the Michigan
State meet at Trees Pool tomorrow
at 2:30 p.m. Last year the team
suffered a narrow 68-63 loss to
Michigan State.

Although it lost to North Carolina
last week, Bradshaw was impres-

might have been able (if McDon-
ald’s were sponsoring another

promotion) to treat their fans to-

hamburgers by halftime against
Bobby Morris, there is no cause for
unbridled celebration at the Field
House. - -
The reason? This team’s goal
(20 wins) is mademoredistant by
a pair of unknowns: Pitt’s inside
game, and the Panthers’ ability to

- win outside the Field House.’

Pitt’s big menwere expected to
be a strong point (especially in Sam
Clancy’s case) this season, but that
‘cannot be claimed today. Ed
Scheuermann’s ankle injury may
prevent him from playing this
season, and, while a redshirt might
be the best thing ever to happen to
Scheuermann-at Pitt, the Panthers

would not be so. fortunate.

Pitt needs Scheuermann, es-
pecially since it has been establish-
ed that Clancy requires some
assistance near the hoop. " Pitt
coach Tim Grgurich can -‘count
himself blessed, along with Pitt
followers, that Sammie Ellis has
shown himself to be more
dependable‘ than the average
first-year Panther .has been
recent years.

in

But Clancy’s jumpshot, effective
at Wheeling, has disappeared at
the Field House, ‘and a family
illness may compromise further
Clancy’s ability to dominate Pitt’s
next few basketball games.

And with Clancy’s recent on- and
off-court troubles has come the
news that Scheuermann, a 6-foot-
11 junior who gained ‘weight and

sed with the team. -
“-The Pitt-North Carolina I meet
featured the best competition in the
east,” said Bradshaw. “We made
a very good showing.
“Our main goal now is to win the
next meet and qualify as many

swimmers as possible for the.-

nationals before the January

season starts,” continued Brad-

shaw. /
Michigan State will offer stiff

confidence this summer, may not
return before next fall.

‘‘I’m not sure what‘ will
happen,” Scheuermann said Wed-
nesday. “It could go either way,
and I don’t know when the decision

‘will be made.”

Grgurich and Scheuermann like-
ly will share responsibility for the
decision, which will inﬂuence‘ Pitt’s
season in a large way. '

Also important to the Panthers
(3-O) this year will be their
performance on the road. Pitt
could go undefeated (13-0) at
home, but 11 home wins seems a
more reasonable assumption:

Thus, almost half of Pitt’s wins I

needbe accomplished during Pitt’s
13-game away schedule. That may
be difﬁcult, since Syracuse, Iona,
Duke and Villanova will entertain
the Panthers and since only Rio
Grande (already beaten)- and
Canisius (Dec. 20) can be consider-i
ed easy marks among the other
road opponents. ‘

PITT NOTES: Students will be
admitted to tomorrow night’s
game, and those which will take
place during Christmas break, with
ID and current validation

“There will be no free-food’

promotion at tomorrow night’s
game,” Pitt _ spokesman Dean
Billick said. “But we expect to
resume the idea, tho.ugh on a
different basis, at the next home
game (Indiana of'Pa., Dec. 16).
The idea still will be to , generate
enthusiasm and pay our fans back

     Duquese lWins Recruiting Batte, Now ust Win Games

Duquesne University’s four_ prize additions to its
1978 basketball team have been referred to as
everything from the “top prospects from the Pit-
tsburgh area” to “some of the best recruits money
can buy.” But whether you are a rabid Dukes fan or
a confirmed cynic, -it is impossible to ignore the fact
that coach Mike Rice and some influential Duquesne
alumni are making a serious effort to bring basket-‘
ball glory back to the Bluff. "

The addition of freshmenforwards Bruce Atkins

F. -and Doug Arnold, center Bill Clarke from Allegheny

Community College and freshman guard Rod Scott
to a squad that returns both its leading scorer and its
leading rebounder from a year ago gives the Dukes a
potential powerhouse. If everyone plays up to his
capabilities. . . '

Duquesne has begun the season as well as possible
by winning three games in as many outings against
the likes of Indiana (Pa.), Canisus and Niagara. In
each of these victories, however,‘ the Dukes have let
their green edges show. A ,

In the most recent win over Niagara at the Civic
Arena, Rice saw his youngsters fight back from a, six-
point deficit to take a 16-point lead midway through
the second half... As leads are wont to do with young

teams, it’ was frittered to seven points before the

finishing touches were put on a 82-69 victory._.

First and Goal

l

“I have a feeling every game will end up being a
venture with this‘ team,” said R_ice. “If we had been
a senior ballclub, we could have had a lot of fu_n.”
The starting lineup has been Atkins, Arnold,
sophomore Ronnie Dixon and juniors John Moore
and B.B. Flenory. Flenory plays the point and
prefers to take his set shot from that general vicinity.
Moore and Atkins play underneath and have done
little but pound the-boards so far this season, while
Dixon and Arnold have been somewhat trigger-
happy from the other guard and forward post,
respectively. _ . ’
“We’re still trying to find ourselves,” said Rice.

“If a team made us do a lot of things we didn’t want »

to, we’d be in trouble.

“Well, a team could run a defense we didn’t par-
ticularly like,” said Rice, somewhat reluctant to
elaborate on his team’s weaknesses. “A veteran
team might be able to ‘play’ around with it (the defen-
se), but we would
soon.” A '

- l

have a tendency toshoot too‘ ;nj_

This the Dukes did on several occasions against the

"Purple Eagles, but this time at least, the bombs were
hitting their targets. Moore threw up an 18-foot jum- '

per and hit nothing but net, as did Dixon a couple

_ times when the Dukes had no one in position to

rebound. Rice would be a fool if he expected

/

Duquesne to be able to do that against the good

teams and win. Rice is no fool.
“We played as well as this young team can during
the first 10 minutes of the second half,” said Rice.
“Then we quit playing defense and everyone started
looking for the fast break and the easy score. If we

'di_d that against a team like’Cincinnati, we’d be in

.trouble. ’ ’ ’

_ For all their rough edges, Atkins. Arnold and in
Clarke (who has become an Arena favorite). should

all develop into ballplayers, but just how good they
become is largely up to each individual. -. »
“Arnold and Atkins are not playing like "fresh-
men,”‘said Rice. “When a freshman starts a game
poorly, it’s like agshooter missing his first six
shots—things, keep going downhill. Arnold keeps
coming back: he looks. for offense.” , ‘
Duquesne has come‘ a long way, but has at least

._that4fa'r to goto. begin paying dividends to the alum- ~ A
Maybe next year they should recruit ‘at point

 Icers’ Riehl ls Smallest  
Only When Speaking of Size 

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Unlike his teammates, Panther

attending Pitt.

“My area (Lancaster County).

isn’t too keen on the sport,” said

_ Riehl, a reserve right wing. “High

school teams are almost non-exist-
ent. If you want to play, you do so
without the benefit of coaching.”

Because of this, Riehl initially
hesitated about trying out.

“I didn't know what it would be
like to play with guys like Curt Hetz
and Bill Gideon, who just have
more natural ability and exper-
ience,” said Riehl, a junior from
Akron, Pa. “But I figured what the
heck’. I’ve always enjoyed hockey
and this probably is my last
opportunity to play. I tried out last
season, made the team and am not

about to give up. I'm having too
much fun.”

Used sparingly last season, Riehl
is playing more and worrying less.

“I’m deﬁnitely seeing more ice

- time” said Riehl, who at 5-foot-7,

145 pounds is the smallest Panther.
“In fact, I probably played more in
our first game (a 5-1 win over Penn
State-McKeesport) than I did all
last year.”

Riehl still doesn’t play as much
as he would like because he is on
the third line——and Pitt usually
plays its first two lines—but that
doesn't bother Riehl.

“I have a lot more confidence

‘this season than I did last season,”
“The fact that I -

played so much (almost the entire
game) against Penn Stat_e-McKees-
port was a big‘ confidence builder.

“I’m skating better," Riehl
continued. “I’m a lot better than I
was last year, although I don't have
all the moves I would like to have. I
haven't reached my potential yet
and probably won’t until after I
graduate. But, slowly. I'm getting
better."

Despite his increased playing
time, Riehl is still at a disadvantage
because of his lack of experience.

“,It’s funny, but in practice, we
won't review the basics because.
the coaches think we know them,”
he said. “As it turns out, everyone
knows them, except me. The guys
kid me and tell me I better wis'e up.
but I'm still learning."

Riehl, who prides himself on his
checking ability, has yet to score
his first goal or record his first
assist. But that doesn't matter; he
is content just playing.

1 ._ Taking one game at a time and
putting things together as a unit
will determine the fate of the Pitt
women’s basketball team when the
Pitt Invitational opens tonight. The
Pantherettes will take the court at 9
p.m. in the Field House against
Indiana University at Bloomington.

Entering her second Pitt Invita-
tional, head coach Jean Balthaser

\

ﬁnds it essential for the Panther-
ettes to -look at each game
individuallv. “We have to

concentrate on one game at a
time,” said Balthaser, “beginning

with Indiana on Friday night.”

Senior Robin Fry, captain of the
Pantherette squad, agrees. “I
think we have a good chance to win
this tournament,” said Fry, “but to
do so we must take each game
seriously. We can’t underestimate

any of the teams we competed
against in last year’s tourney.
Each team gets better every year

Pitt’s women’s gymnastics
cC.:{ch Donna DeMarino Sanft is
pleased her team’s next meet,
against West Virginia, is not until
Jan. 10.

“Some of our girls have been
hurt,” Sanft explained. “We have
a good amount of time until our
next meet, so we hope some of our
injuries heal and we will be ready
to go in January.”

Both of the Pantherettes’ top
returnees are
injuries. Sophomore Myra Bachuc-
in recently underwent foot surgery,
and Bonnie Tressler suffered a
hand injury in practice this week.

Bachuchin, the nation’s fifth best
gymnast, according to Internation-
a‘.?3ymnast magazine, and Tressler
competed in the Association of
Intercollegiate Athletics for Wom-
en national championship meet as
freshmen. '

Two other Pantherettes, Jill
Morris and Diane Debich, are
recovering from leg injuries.

Pitt opened its season two weeks
ago by finishing second to
Louisiana State, 128.6-127.35, in
the Midwest Open at Chicago.

Pitt (15th) and’Louisiana State

‘ (11th) both are ranked nationally;

the Pantherettes ﬁnished 11th last
season.

‘The Pantherettes were led by
freshman Holly Martino, who
ﬁnished first on the balance beam
and” second in all-around competi-
tion. Three other Pantherettes,
Bachuchin, Tressler and freshman
Roxanne Evans, ﬁnished in the top
10 in their events.

Heading into , the dual-meet
season, Sanft is optimistic but
believes inexperience could hurt
her team, which has no seniors and

only two juniors (Alison Hoburg
and Kathy Spine).

Sanft, however, still thinks the
Pantherettes can hold their own
against teams like Penn State, last
year’s national- champion, and
ﬁfth-ranked Clarion.

“Things are going to get
better,” the Pantherette coach
said. “Things will get a lot easier
as we go along. We’ll have another
good season, but just how good is
hard to tell because we are still so
young.”

Ealthaser. “A big factor against
Indiana will be our ability to gain

_ control of the boards.”

Organized teamwork, however,
may be the most important factor.
“We have’ had .a lot of good
individual performances in the four

games we have played this

season,” said Balthaser, “but the
big factor is playing together as a
unit. This is a must for us to win.”

If the Pantherettes win the
opening contest with Indiana, they
then must face either Edinboro or

» West Virginia.

If there is a favorite team in the
tourney, it is Penn State, the
defending tournament champs.
PSU also sports an 11th-place
national ranking and returns four
starters from last year’s team.

Edinboro is another team return-
ing almost all its players and which
beat PSU in the regionals.
Edinboro and PSU are in the same
bracket in the tournament and the
game should prove an interesting
rematch.
