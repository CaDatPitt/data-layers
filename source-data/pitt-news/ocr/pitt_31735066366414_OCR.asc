SG Fails to Ratify Allocations

‘UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Formal Dedication Scheduled
For Space Research Center;

- NASA Officials Be Present

The Space Research Coordina-
tion Center building will be dedi-
cated at 4 p.m. Thursday in a
seminar-type program in 223
Langley Hall.

“We're going to hold an in-
formational seminar rather than
a purely ceremonial dedication
because of the importance of the
facility to" the region,” said Dr.
David Halliday, director of the
space center and dean of the di-
vision of natural sciences. “The
occasion gives us an opportunity
to introduce some of the men and
programs to the community,” he
added.

The seminar part of the pro-
gram will include remarks by an
official of the National/Aeronaw
tics and Space Administrations
(NASA) and a local industrialist;
brief descriptions of research by
three University professors; and
a general survey of the research
by Dr. Halliday. The seminar
will be followed by guided tours
of the building, located next to
Th-aw Hall on O’Hara Street.

The building, ﬁnanced through
a $1,500,000 grant from NASA,
was completed this summer and
fully occupied this fall. It is the
headquarters for all space re-
search at the University and
houses a number of the projects.

Special guests ‘for the dedica-
tion will be Dr. Homer E. Newell,
associate administrator, S p a c e
Science and Application, NASA,
and Dr. Howard L. Gerhart, di-
rector of Research and Develop-
ment Center, Coatings and Resine
Division, Pittsburgh Plate Glass.

The three scientists who will
describe their research ‘are Dr.
Alvin Cohe, professor of geo-
chemistry; Dr. Thomas Donahue,
professor of physics; and Allen
professor of library sci-

 nces and director of the Know-

ledge Availability Systems Cen-
ter.

Representing the University
will be Dr. Stanton -C. Crawford,
acting chancellor, and Dr. John
Geise, vice-chancellor for region-
al programs. About 300 persons
are expected to -attend including
industrialists, NASA representa-
tives, area scientists and Univer-
sity faculty and students. '

The structure is a ﬁve story
brick and concerte building. of

0 rooms, 32 are laboratories, and

Evan were built on a ﬂexible plan

so that laboratories and offices
can be expanded or divided with-
out major renovation.

Ground was broken for the
new building on Feb. 24, 1964.
In June of that year, cornerstone
ceremonies were held and con-
struction was completed a year
later in June of 1965. The Space
Research Coordination Center
(SRCC), of which the building is
a part, was established in Jan-
uary, 1963, to serve as a focal
point for space research and
space-related research underway
at the University-

 1- yr, -.

 

NASA numnme, located on 0’Hara St., will be dedicated Thursday.

The University work is funda-
mental or pure research. “The
three phases of the research to
be described by the scientists

' were chosen to give a sample of

the variety and kind of work be-
ing done by the center,” Dr.
Halliday said. Dr. Cohen will dis-
cuss the efforts of collisions of
meterorites with the earth and
the .moon; Dr. Donahue will re-
view atmosphere studies; and
Professor Kent will show how
local industries can beneﬁt from
space technologies through a
“spin off” project already under-
way,

The building houses the space-
related programs of the Depart-
ment of Physics, associated pro-
grams of the Departments of

Chemistry and Metallurgy, much’

of the Department of Earth and
Planetary Sciences, the Know-
ledge Availability Systems Cen-
ter and the headquarters of the
SRCC. The SRCC coordinates

space-oriented research in vari-

ous schools, divisions and cen-
ters of‘ the University.

The Center provides partial sup-
port for space.-oriented research,
particularly for new faculty mem-
bers; it awards annually a num-
her of postdoctoral fellowships
and NASA predoctoral trainee-
ships.

Support comes from NASA,
through a research grant and
through ‘grants from the A. W.
Mellon Foundation and the Sarah
able Trusts, the Maurice Falk
Medical Fund, the Richard King
Mellon Foundation and the Sarah
Mellon Scaife Foundation. .

Policies

Recommendations Set
Without Legal Quorum

Student Government (SG) failed to ratify the policies
and procedures for allocating funds from the Activities Fee
‘at its meeting last Thursday night. Although acting With-
out a quorum, the senators made recommendations to the
Allocations Committee concerning the procedures. The sen-
ate has withheld ratiﬁcation until their recommendation are

approved by the committee.

At the same meeting, SG passed
a resolution changing the date
of election. In a bill introduced
by Senator Rick Schweder, a per-
manent date for SG elections was
set at the third Wednesday of the
winter trimester. In 1966, it will
be Jan. 26.

This bill moves elections up
from previous years when they
were held late in February. Now
SG officers will take office on

Feb. 1. The bill stipulates that "

no elections of any other major
organization may take place be-
fore the SG election. The bill
goes into effect for the 1966 elec-
tions.

In a meeting that lasted close
to ﬁve hours only one other piece.
of legislation was discussed and

voted .on. A bill introduced by -

Senator John Smith and four
other senators establishing the
method of selection for chairman
of major campus events was de-
feated.

The bill had called for a selec-
tion ‘committee composed of the
SG president, the chairman of
the Student Union Board, and
the previous year’s chairman.

After that bill was defeated
debate began on a constitutional
amendment that would have
changed the composition of the
senate so‘ that there would be 32
senators elected at large by the
student body. The bill would
have changed previous procedure
by which students in each school
(Liberal Arts, Engineering and
Mines, etc) elected their own
representatives.

The -bill also called for a sen-
ate seat for either the president
or vice-president of Associated
Women Students, Engineering
and Mines Cabinet, Interfrater-
nit)’ Council, Men’s Council,
Men’s'Dorm Council, Pan Hellen-
ic Council, Student Union Board
and Women's Residence Hall
Council.

For close to three quarters of

‘an hour the senate debated an

amendment that the Basic Stu-
dent Nurse Association be given
a seat in the senate. The amend-
ment was eventually passed with
no naye votes being cast and only’
one abstention. At this point sev-
eral senators left and there was
no longer a quorum. The sena-
tors continued to do business, for
some senators explained later
that a call for a quorum had to
be called before the lack of a
quorum could be recognized.
—Next on the agenda, after sev-
eral bills were tabled, were the
policies and procedures for al-
locating funds from the Activities
Fee, SG Vice-President Marcia
Bernstein suspended parlimen-
tary procedure and an open dis-
cussion was held on the policies.

' able disease.” \
‘ Mrs. Oswald’s theory was re-
' vealed by writer Jean Stafford
H inna copyrighted interview in the
" October issue of McCalI’s.
“President Kennedy was a dy-
ing man,” Mrs. Oswald asserted.
“He has Atkinon’s diseases, which
_is a disease of the kidney, and
we know that he had‘ three op-
ferations on his back and that
. ‘R he would have been a lingering
_, President.” The article gave no
further information to substan-
tiate-her theories.
_ (Miss Stafford reported she
asked Mrs. Oswald whether she
' was referring to the rumors that
the President had had Addison’s
disease, “a deﬁciency of the ad-
renal glands, and thanks to cor-
tisone, no longer fatal . . . she
" found my interruption irrelevant
and answered simply,
ever.”’)
V I “For security reasons, we could
. 1 not have a lingering President,
I . because of our conﬂicts with
A other nations,” said said. “So why
‘I - wouldn’t it be just a normal thing
to have a mercy killing of the
_ President? _/
.. “Now, maybe Lee Harvey Os-
’ . wald was the assassin, but does
that make him a louse? No, no.
ii.‘ Killing doesn’t necessarily mean
badness,” continued Mrs. Oswald.
“You ﬁnd killing in some very
ﬁne homes for one reason or
another.”
The assassin’s mother complain-
ed, “Here is Mrs. Kennedy, a
very wealthy woman; Mrs. Tip-
pet, a very wealthy woman; and
Marina is very wealthy, and here
I'm wondering where my next
Smeal is coming from.
“Here we are, four women in
, history, and yet I am the mother;
I but has anyone come forward to
, reimburse me for my emotional
- « . stability? No, no and I have given

 Mercy Killing  

Mrs. Marguerite Oswald, mother of President John F.
._. Kennedys assassin, charged that her son may have been in-
P volved with the United States Secret Service in “a mercy
 killing.” She feels it was a conspiracy to remove the Presi-
< dent from office because he was suffering from “an incur-

‘What-V

« prove my son innocent. I can do

time and my voice, and I have
twenty-three hundred dollars to
my name.”

Mrs. Oswald reported to the
McCall’s interviewer that when
she heard that Oswald’s wife,
Marina, had been offered money
for the murder gun by a collec-
tor, “I said to myself, ‘Now these
guns are worth a great deal more
than $10,000 and Marina‘ should
get more money for my grand-
children.’ I am thinking about
the welfare of my grandchil-
dren.”

She said she had called the
Fort Worth St,ar/Telegram and
told them “those guns are price-
less but if they're going to be
sold, let's see some justice done
to the children of Lee Harvey
Oswald.”

Mrs. Oswald claimed,- “I know
who framed my son, and he
knows’ I know who framed my
son.” _

When the interviewer asked
her whether “he” was in Texas,
now she replied: “I can divulge
nothing on that score.”

She said, “I can absolutely

it any time I want by going to
Washington, D. C., with some pic-
tures.”

She recalled that her son had
had a stamp collection when he
was a boy, “and he loved to play
Monopoly, which is a thinking
game. So was stamps.” He also
enjoyed playing chess, his mother
revealed. “So he was really a
very busy little boy, and I don't
see anything abnormal about any
part of his life. He'd climb up on
the roof to look at the stars and
I'd have to get the older boys
to get him down because he was
interested in astronomy.

“I would say that the Oswald
family was actually an average
American family,” she said.

 John Bircher Speaks
To Delta Sig Fraternity

Lou Byers, the Pittsburgh and
Tri-State representative to the
John Birch Society, was the guest
speaker at the Delta Sigma Phi
fraternity house Monday eve-
ning. Kappa Kappa Gamma so-
rority attended the évent, and
Dr. Robert D. Marshall, assistant
professor of English, was invited
to [the session.

Byers showed a movie on the
John Birch Society, produced by
its founder, Robert Welch. A

cussed. ' v I

Commenting to the meeting, at-

 tended by approximately 85 peo-

ple, Jim Smith, former vice-presi-
dent of Delta Sigma Phi, said, “I
think it was probably one of the
ﬁrst attempts of Greek organiza--
tions to present to their mem-

bers a controversial political
theory. From theicomments made
by everybody there, it was most
enjoyable.”

Miss ‘Linda Schumaker, the na-

also in attendance at the event.

CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS

In an effort to prevent fires, the University has 9. require-
ment that all decorations be flameproof. Use artificial trees

whenever possible, n_ever attach lights to aluminum trees” due to , ‘-

shock hazard. If live trees are used, they must be sprayed with
a flameproofing solution. Adequately support your tree in.-a
container filled with sand and kept moist with water. .

The Buildings and Grounds Department will flameproof. all‘
trees and cut greens without charge. Those ordered through
the Purchasing Department will be so treated when delivered
to you. Arrangements for flameproofing must be made withthe

elsewhere.

Sand for ﬁlling containers will be available at no charge”

your office or group.

‘-

All tree lights must- be turned ‘off before leaving the build-
ing or upon retiring. No candles or other open ﬂame type of .
lighting is permitted. Check all wiring before using and be-
sure it is of an approved type and in good condition. .

University Departments wishing to purchase Christmas
trees and bundles of greens for decorating may do so through
the Purchasing Department. Requisitions should state the type

rally.

Editor, The Pitt News:

‘I have been waiting a long
time to see what the colleges in
Pennsylvania and the students
views were on the war in Viet-
nam. Needless to say I am from
‘Pennsylvania, and have been to
_the University many times.

I would like to pass on from
myself, and my fellow Pennsyl-
vanians here in Vietnam, our
sincere thanks, for backing us. As
I said, I and a few more were
waiting to hear from just one
college in Pennsylvania, and we
are really proud of you.

I" realize that all the students
‘there aren’t from Pennsylvania
but mhst“ are, and we believe
they are all loyal Americans. I
am from Duquesne, Pennsyl-

vania, and there are many here
' /from the surrounding area of
Pittsburgh.

We think that each student at
Pitt is capable of making up his
' ~ or her mind and we would’ like
to give a little thanks to the

you over there, that we are do-
ing a job here that needs to be
done, and thank each and every
one of you ﬁne Americans, for
a’ backing us up over here.

I am a gunner on a helicopter

always bring out as many as you
take in, but I have yet to hear
one of them complain about be-
ing over here. We feel we are
needed here, and with the ﬁne
spirit of the Pitt students, we
will continue our efforts for you
and the rest of the American
citizens that believe in freedom.

Good luck to you this coming

Once again we must retell a sad tale of our Student Government
(SG). Last Thursday, they were presented the procedure for allocation of
the activities fee as proposed by the Allocations Committee. The issue was
top priority—it has been unresolved for seven months.

I Yet the Senatelwaited until 10 a.m. to begin the formal presentation
and informal discussion of the bill. The Senate waited until it had less than
a quorum to discuss the most important issue.

p _ Earlier in-the meeting several bills were discussed and resolved while
22 Senators were present. When the issue of dealing with allocations pro-
cedure for $25,000, was presented, only 12 members were present.

It was obvious there was no quorum. Yet the Senators refused to call
for the quorum. As a result, the allocations procedure was discussed. by
a handful of Senators and recommendations were made.

The allocations proposal should have been the’ ﬁrst issue of busi-
ness. Rules should have been suspended at the outset of the meeting
and the 22 Senators should have been allowed to discuss it before any
other motions were proposed. It would have given more credibility to the

Students Form
Viet Committee

The following letter was sent
to The Pitt News from the Na-
tional Student Committee for the
Defense of Vietnam.

Editor, The Pitt News: -

The college-aged students 0
the United States have been bad-
ly criticized in recent months for
their attitude toward the Viet-
nam issue. This criticism has 're-
sulted from an unfortunate wide-

” spread publicity given to the
small, noisy minority of students
who have been opposing the
American defense of Vietnam.

Consequently, Young Republi-
cans, Young Democrats, and In-
dependents have come together
to form the new bi-partisan Na-
tional Student Committee for the
Defense of Vietnam. This new
student committee has no asso-

ciation with an extra-party po-.

litical organization of either the
right or the left. Our sole pur-
pose is to mobilize college stu-
dents in a concerted program of
responsible action in support of
American resistance to Commun-
ist aggression in Southeast Asia.

Speciﬁcally, we will engage in
a number of activities on the
campus level. First, our commit-

Now the Allocations Commmittee must accept SG’s recommendations
before the procedure can be adopted. There has been no date set for the’
committee meeting — the allocations will obviously not be made this

Although the Senate handled the issue with its usual low level legis-
lative ability, there is one valid recommendation the 12 Senators proposed.

As proposed, the committee would require a unanimous vote of its

ﬁlve members before allocations would be approved. Senator Rick Schweder
amptly noted this rule would give “power to the minority” on the com-
mittee. One person could stall any allocation.

Whether that one person be the administrative Voting member, John
Vrana, or a student ‘does not matter. Either way it is ridiculous to have

a committee where one person can deny an allocation. 1

ommendation should be adopted.

Letters To The Editor

tee intends to distribute and col-
lect petitions supporting the
United States defense of Viet-

nam. If your college already has-

distributed petitions on behalf
of American policy in Vietnam,
we would appreciate your indi-
cation to us of the number of
students who have signed. At the
end of November, we plan to an-
nounce nationally, the total num-
ber of student signatures favor-
ing the American commitment to
the people of South Vietnam.

Secondly, we are urging col-
lege campuses, especially during
the period from Nov. 22-Dec. 10,
to engage in a series of rallies

supporting American policy in

Vietnam. Ifyou feel that it. is
possible for your University to
hold such a rally during this per-
iod, please let us know the date
for the rally and any informa-
tion you might have as to its na-
ture.

Thirdly, we plan to distribute
educational materials to college
campuses explaining this coun-
try’s position in Vietnam. Please"
let us_know if we can be of assis-
tance to you in this area.

Finally, we urge students‘ on
your campuses to send Christmas
cards to our soldiers in Vietnam.
You can address these cards in
care of the World Affairs Forum,
Brigham Young University, Pro-
vo, Utah. The cards must reach

Brigham Young by Dec. 1, if our

soldiers are to receive them on
Christmas Day.

We welcome your cooperation
and assistance in the bi-partisan,
national program -to show the
American people that the new
student radicals do not speak for
our generation in their irrespon-
sible opposition to our country's
policy in Vietnam.

If you have any qu,estions as
to any phase ,of our committee,
please feel free to write us.

Coach Leo Bemis feels that two
‘pots are already ﬁlled. One team
’would be Stroudsburg (10-1) and
the other West Chester (8-2). Se-
lections are basically determined
by the Saylor Point System which
"rates teams according to their rec-
ords and who they have played.
,5 ‘Besides the booters, Temple
and Swarthmore are the main
teams being considered by the
selection committee. “Although
7both' show.Winning‘ seasons, the
lcalibre’ of their opponents doesn’t
-‘(appear very high,” Bemis said. ‘
Last Saturday's shutout of Buck-
hnell University, 3-0, at Kennard
Field, enhanced the booters‘
chances. It was their sixth win
‘in a row, raising their record
to 7-1-1.

Of the soccermen’s seven vic-
tories, four have been shutouts,
"and in three others, the team’s
"stingy defense allowed only one
- goal.
S In Saturday’s, the soccer team
: grabbed a ﬁrst period 2-0 lead

‘on goals by Don Milillo (who
took three shots) and Sal Tavares

‘ , until the ﬁnal quarter when Dave

the range from close in, making
it 3-0. .

nell game. It was mostly ‘because
his team won, but it was also be-
cause a‘ crowd of approximately
500 to 600 viewed the game des-
pite the sudden change of ﬁelds
from the Stadium to Kennard.

“After we got the lead in the
game, we slacked- off,” Bemis
said, “but it’s tough to keep a
pace when we play a team which-
can’t keep up with us. The large
crowd pushed us and let us know
that someone knows about «,our
team.” '

Captain Jim Cuddy, a defensive
fullback, expressed the team's
feelings on the crowd. “When no
one is here, it’s just like another
scrimmage. Wheh someone is
there hollering, then winning the
game means more.”

The letdown of the players
possibly could be attributed to
tiredness, in trying to ﬁnd, the
site of the game. First it was
scheduled for Forbes Field, then
the Stadium, and ﬁnally Ken-
nard. Even Schenley Oval was
considered.

Resodding of the ﬁelds was the
reason given to the soccer team
as to why they couldn’t play on
the ﬁrst two sites. At Forbes
Field, a high school football game
was to be played. At the Stadium,
the Athletic Department felt that

This confusion was over a team
which may (or may not) get an
NCAA bid. If the team did re-

ceive a bid, they probably would-
n’t be a home team. The ﬁrst
reason, according to NCAA reg-
ulations, is that a team must have
a suitable ﬁeld. The second rea-

must show that they could draw -

LOS ANGELES, California (Nov. 13) — In ancient classical history the wooden '
horse is symbolic of the defeat of the city of Troy by the Greeks. The Wooden horse which

By TOM SACKS

Tiheiri Seventh Loss in 28-0 Rout

the Panthers were banking on to upset Southern California’s Trojans in Saturday’s game

at Los Angeles lost its legs some-
where during the course of his-
tory.

In losing their seventh game
of the season, 28-0*, the gridders
rolled up a total of only 74 yards
on the ground on 31 carries.
Quarterback Kenny Lucas was
forced to rely once again on his
arm, but that same line which
wasn’t opening up the holes for
the running game also wasn’t
plugging up the holes for the
passing game. ‘

Lucas attempted 31 passes of
which only 13 were caught. Sev-
en times he dropped back to pass
only to be smothered by blitzing
Trojanilinebackers. Five of his
passes were placed right in the
hands of his receivers only to be
dropped and four of his aerials
were intercepted. Two were pick-
ed off in the end zone.

“I had no choice but to pass,”
said Lucas. “Our running plays
were going no where. I think the
only call that worked was ‘the

"draw. This is probably the worst

physical, beating I’ve taken.”
Fortunately for Lucas’ bruised
ribs the offensive unit wasn’t
seeing the ball that much as it
was. Souther Cal had a habit of
grinding out the yardage and as
long as Mike Garrett was in the

ball game the defensive unit
could ﬁnd no cure to the habit.

The Heisman Trophy candidate
carried the ball 26 times for 156
yards and three touchdowns.
When Garret was in the back-
ﬁeld two out of three calls went
in his direction.

“One of Pitt’s defensive play-
ers, I think the. left end, kept
asking me when I"d line up for
the play if I ever get tired of
running with the ball,” said Gar-
rett after the game. “I told him
to get a petition and maybe I'd
stop.”

The defensive unit which -by
this time has gotten used to try-
ing to tackle some of the best
backs in the country tried again
Saturday but with the same re-
sults. ‘

“We couldn’t key on Garrett
because of (Rod) Sherman and
(Troy) Winslow, who do a lot
of running and throwing. We just
couldn't do a one-man key,” said
coach John l\/Iichelosen.

It was left up to Trojan coach
John McKay to stop Garrett by
letting his second stringers run
the offense for nearly half the
game.

“I guess they weren’t using
Garrett that much so they can
save him for their big game next

“MoustacI1io’ ’ Leads Yogi Contest I
With Only One Week Remaining

With only one week remain-
ing in the Yogi competition,
George “Moustachio” Lies holds
a comfortable four game lead
over Bill “The Log” Cabin. For
“Moustachio,” it was another

steady week as he picked 13 out-

of 15 contests.

Only the Mississippi upset over
Tennessee and California’s de-
featof Oregon prevented “Mous-
tachio’? from a perfect record.
“The Log” fought gamely to
catch the leader. “I tried,” he
muttered. '

Try he did with a duplicate
_13-2 mark. It was “The Log’s”
best week of the season. Unfor-

— tunately for him, his best was

not enough’. Now he must hope

for a minor\mirac1e if he is to
win the contest. ‘

sen. To those in the stands it
seemed like McKay was acting
more out of pity. than foresight.

Offensively it was another rec-
ord day for . Eric Crabtree. He
caught four passes in the game,
pushing his season total to 40
and his career mark to 63 break-
ing two records set back in 1951
by Chris Warriner.

The Panthers had their ﬁrst
good chance‘ to blow a scoring
opportunity after Ed Assid had

recovered a fumble on the Trojan '

34 with two minutes remaining
in the ﬁrst half. On ﬁrst down,
Lucas connected with Bob Longo,
who caught the ball in the crowd,
for a 16 yard gain. ’ ’
On the next play Lucas tossed
the ball to Bobby Dyer, who was
all alone in the end zone, but
the ball bounced in and out of
his hands. Two more passes fell
short and the next one was inter-

' cepted.

The next scoring chancecame
in the fourth quarter. But after
driving 71 yards, another Lucas
pass was picked off.

For Midday

(Continued from Page 1)

Since making her American
debut at the Metropolitan Opera
House in 1938 as “Giselle,” Dame
Alicia has been associated with
the Company as prima ballerina
in “Die Fledermaus” and “Or-
feo ed Euridice,” and now is in

' complete charge of the Ballet

Company as a whole.
Throughout the United States

A Dame Alicia Mardova has starred

with the Ballet Russe de Monte
Carlo and America Ballet The-
atre. She has danced in “Giselle,”
“Swan Lake,” “The Sleeping
Beauty,” “Les Sylphides,” and
“Rouge et Noir.”

She has been called “the em-
bodiment of Romantic Ballet,”
and to balletomanes she has
made the role of “Giselle” her
own, writing about her unique
interpretation of it in her auto-
biography, “Giselle and I.”

John Martin, New York Times
dance critic, called her “not only
the best living ballet dancer, but

‘probably the greatest who ever

lived.”

Dame Alicia, who began her
career when still a child as the
youngest ballerina of the famed
Diaghilev Ballet, has an excep-
tional history of “ﬁrsts”' in the
ballet world. She has started
more ballet companies than any
other ballerina, was the ﬁrst bal-

Grad Students iSeek

Representation , Unity

A group of graduate students who feel there is a def-
nite lack of representation on their behalf have created an

organization to promote unity. The ﬁrst meeting to deter;

mine policy and purpose will be

held in Dining Room A, SU, to-
night at 8 p.m.

The meeting is open to all
students, but is directed toward
graduate students in all depart-
ments. The discussion will center
on common University problems
such as greater accessibility to
the library by graduate students,
a discount on books purchased at
the University Book Center, the
enforcement of freedom of the
press concerning the distribution
of literature in the Towers, the.
conditions under which graduate
students do their research, and
the advantages and disadvantages
of the trimester system for this
type of research.
