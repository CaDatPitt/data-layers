‘in the Student Union, Commons

School of the Health _Professions.

The Elections Committee has
announced that _a dinner will be
held at 5:30 p.m. today in Dining
Room C SU for everyone who
has volunteered to count election
ballots. , .
_ Electi-on returns will be posted
as they come in this evening on

That othersite, of course, would
be on the North Side. What rela-
tion would Pitt have with the
Municipal Stadium if it were built
in that area and what is _the Uni-

chancellor stat-ed. “No one has
come to me and asked, ‘Will you
play there?’.” ‘

is no possible truth to the rumor

that Pitt has already been com- _

Students to Pay for Sports?

_ SGA Discusses Motion

To Charge Admissions

The proposal that ‘students should pay for admission to
athletic events was the main topic of discussion at last Mon-
day’s meeting of the Student Government Association. John
L. Sullivan, Arts ’59, chairman of the Athletic Committee,
-gave his report Onlthis situation. _

P The committee report advised SGA to recommend t5 the

"Administration and to the ,Ath—¢

letic Department the adoption. of
the following proposals; ‘ F
. ( 1) That a more stringent check
and control of student ID cards

i- be maintained; tohachieve this we

recommend the adoption of .a
combination Student Activity -

‘ Identiﬁcation Card.

_ (2) That the Student section be
reduced in size to include only
s_ectio'ns 15, 16, and 17; and that
the Athletic Department be award-
ed section 14 with full right to
sell season or individual game

_ tickets for that area.

‘Section Reduced .
(a) This Will reduce the student
section to 5,127 seats, but this
number will be suﬁicient to ac-
comodate those students _who

» wholeheartedly support Pitt foot-

ball. — -
(b) -This willalso enable the
Athletic Department to acquire
. increased revenues and it will
thereby lessen the possibility of
students being forced to pay for
the privilege of attending ath-
letic events.
(3) That henceforth the Athletic
Department be, asked to refrain
from granting class seven or other

- complimentary passes for sections

15, 16, or 17. Instead, we recom-
mend that these passes be mark-
ed speciﬁcally “Section 14 Only”
and that this section be completely

separated from the student sec-

tion by means Of a wire fence.
Proposals Approved
(4) That 400 tickets be set aside
as d-ate tickets for each home game
and that these tickets go on sale
the Monday before each game.
- These proposals, which were
approved by the ‘governing
body, were based on three fac-
tors, the attempt to eliminate
“extraneous people” from the
student section; the curtailment
of the transfer of student_iden'-
tiﬁeation cards among under-
graduates and non-students, and
the reaction of Pitt students to
a proposal suggested by the Ath-

letic Department that students
would have to purchase tickets
for all home football, games.

In the report Sullivan ‘stated,
“We believe that students should
not pe required to pay for the
privilege —of attending athletic
events, it is unfair to burden stu-
dents with the added expense; this
privilege to attend athletic con-
tests free-of—charge is essentially
the same as the privilege involved
with the free use of university
libraries and Student Union fa-
cilities.”

Attendance Declined

“The result of such a plan
would be the penalization of stu-
dents who are the schOol’s most
avid supporters,” he continued.
“We are convinced that reserved
seating in the student "section
would disrupt what little unity
is now evident there as a result
of the participation of various

clubs, interest groups, fraternities, '

and sororities.”

In summing up his report Sul-
livan said he believes these four
motions to be a “good compro-
mise.” On the reduced seating
“Pitt Students, as a whole, do
not support their own team . . .
Student attendance has declined
enormously in the past ten
years.”

He then read the ‘statistics on
game attendance of Pitt students
to prove his point. In -deciding on
the solution to this pr.O'blem, he
stated, “It was just a question of
either hurting a minority or 'a
large body of students.”

Ann Papieski, Arts ’59, made a
motion that SGA “conduct an Ac-
tivities Participation Guide pro-
gram with the following purposes:

to encourage participation when-
ever possible;

to discourage excess participa-
.tion whenever necessary; and to

counsel and advise students in the .

selection of a wise and well bal-
anced activities schedule. The mo-
tion was tabled for next week.

in that area?

The chancellor further said
that the University wants to
think about the proposal a long
time before saying, “We want to
stay here" even if it means the
city can’t ﬁnance a ‘stadium and
therefore lose its professional
baseball and football teams.”

Expressing equalconcern about
' what the city’s attitude should be
toward Pitt in this matter, he said,
"‘The city must bear in mindthat
we are ‘trying to build a new kind
of institution and one of I the
things we need to build it is stu-
dent enthusiasm.

Who would make the decision
whether or not to move‘? “I

- would not undertake to do it
alone,” the chancellor said.
There are too many people in-
terested in this. I’ll make up
my mind and present my opin-
ioncto the Board-of Trustees. I
will then carry out their deci-
sion. . » Z
_ “I think it is most unlikely that

we won’t agree.”
Dr—.‘Litc'hﬁeld had no idea at all
what would happen to Pitt Sta-

\- diumﬁif a move is made. “We

‘ could. tear it_ down, use it for

parking or even open it up in part
for more playing ﬁelds, which has
‘been one proposal.”

The chancellor did say that
the new stadium would have to
include as big a seating capac-
ity as Pitt's ﬁeld does now.

What about Hami1ton’s~ réason-

ing that Pitt would decline as a
national‘ power if the Panthers
played their games in a city-
owned stadium " away from the
campus? Chancellor Litchﬁeld
thought for a minute and said,
“‘It's one of the issues that has
to be considered. I would like to
reserve judgment on that.”

William C. Burns majored in Civil En-

his own ideas about his engineering
future. “I wanted a job with a ‘growth’
company,” he says, “where I could de-
velop and move ahead .as a member of
management.”

Bill found his ‘growth’ company-and
his management opportunity. On gradu-
ating in June, 1954,‘ he- started work
with the New York Telephone Company.
« Six months of training and job assign-
ments in Albany familiarized him with
the Plant, Commercial, Accounting and
‘Traffic functions of the ‘telephone busi-

. ness. Then came ,].8 months as engineer

in the Long Range Planning Group. In
‘October, 1956, he was promoted to Su-
pervising Engineer.

engineers and two clerks. In this job,
he studies and forecasts the future tele-

phone needs of customers ‘in a 4800-.

20 years ahead. He then coordinates.

the development of plans to meet future
needs with the various engineering

In Job Market .

“New placement, statistics
at the University could indi-
cate an uptrend in the job
market,” Dr. Paul Sherwood,
director of the University’s
Placement: Service, said last
week’;

In the past three Weeks corp- -

orations have conducted 3,445 in-
terviews with Pitt students, an
increase of‘ 1,505 over the‘1,94O
interviews conudcted in a com-
parable period last March.

Last March 97 corporations sent
180 interviewers to talk over jobs
with" graduating seniors. In the
past three weeks 114 corporations

sent 27-6 interviewers to the Pitt
lcampus.

- The s t u d e n t s interviewed
were seniors who will be gradu-‘
ated in June and who are regis-
tered with the Placement Serv-
ice. They include primarily stu-
dents of engineering and mines
and of business administration,
but students in the liberal arts
and _other ﬁelds who wish‘to en-
ter the business and‘ industrial
world were also interviewed.

“Figure comparisons “for this
year and last,” said Dr. Sherwood,

”"“point up that the companies are

sending more interviewers —- a
hopeful. sign that more hiring is
taking place, and that students,
still wary of _the job market, are
not passing up any opportuni-
ties.” - , '-

Records for last June show that
241 engineering and mines seniors
were registered with the Place-

ADVENTURES INSOCIAL SCIENCE’: N0. 2

T oday, with earnestness and sobriety, we make the second of
our forays into social science. We take up the most basic of all
social sciences-sociology itself. '

Sociology teaches us that man‘ is a social animal. It.is not
instinct or heredity that determines his conduct; it is environ-
inefnt. This fact is vividly borne out when you consider the case
of Julio Sigaloos. ,

Julio, abandoned as an infant in a dark wood near Cleveland,
was adopted by a pack of wild dogs and reared as one of their

'own. When Julio was found by :1 hunter at the age of twelve,

the poor child was more canine than human. He ran on all
fours, barked and growled, ate raw meat, lapped water with his
tongue, and could neither speak nor understand one single word.
In short, he was a complete product of his environment.
Julio, incidentally, was more fortllnatc than most wild chil-
dren. They never become truly humanized, but Julio was ex-
cept-ionalu Bit by bit, he began to talk and walk and eat and
drink as people do. His long-dormant mental processes, when
awakened at last, turned out to- be ftmt-ast.ic:1lly acute. He was
so bright that he learned to read and write in a month, got
through grammar school in three years, and high school in two.
And last June as thousands of spect:1t.ors, knowing the odds
Julio had overcome, stood and raised cheer after cheer, he was
graduated Valedictorian from Cal Tech with a degree in astro-
physics! ' . ‘ .
~Who can say to what towering heights this incredible boy
would have risen had he not been killed the day after commence-
ment while chasing a car?

     

But I digress. To return to sociology, people tend to gather
in' groups—-—a tendency that began, as we all know, with the
introduction of Marlboro C‘igarettes.Wl1a.t an aid to sociability
they are! How benignly one lodks upon one"s fellows after pull-

-ing on Marlboro’s ﬁlter that really ﬁlters, on Marlboro’s ﬂavor »

that’s rea.llyliﬂavorful. How eager it makes one to extend the
hand of friendship! How "grateful we all are to l\=I:u'lboro for
making possible this togetherness! How good not to live in the
bleak! pre-Marlboro world with every man a stranger!

The groups that people live in today (thanks to Marlboro)
vary widely intheir customs. What is perfectly acceptable in
stance, the case of Ug Van Wyck.

. Ug, a Polynesian lad, grew up in an idyllic South Sea isle

one society may be quite outlandish in another. Take, for in-'

where the leading event of the year was the feast of Max, the
sun’ god. A quaint all-day ceremony was held, with tribal.

dancing, war chants, fat-lady races, pie-eating contests, and, -for
‘the’ grand ﬁnale, the"sac1'-iﬁce of two dozen maidens.

According to Ug’s folkways, sacriﬁcing maidens was entirely
acceptable, but when, in his eighteenth year, he was sent as an
exchange ‘student to the ~'Univers_ity ‘of Wisconsin, he soon
learned that Americans t-ake'a dim View of this 'pr:ictice—in‘
Wisconsin, at any rate. The ﬁrst ﬁfteen or twenty maidens Ug
sacriﬁced, he was let off with ’a warning. When, however, he

"persisted, drastic measures were taken: he was depledged by

his fraternity. A broken man, Ug quit school a.nd-moved to
Milwaukee where today he earns a meager living as a stein.

Sharockman, Morsillo
Leave Fathers in Dark;

EdNot Heard From Yet

_ By MURRAY CHASS

Michael Sharockman and James Morsillo are a couple of
bewildered fathers. Their sons withdrew from Pitt last Fri-
day. and neither father knows where Ed and Pete are now.

‘The two reportedly left for Florida with Mike Lucci and
Marty Baracca, who were expelled from the University also

on F1'iday. Mr. Morillo last saw his son

Pat and the other three went to¢
the Morsillo home in Ambridge.

But Mike Sharockman has
neither seen nor heard from Quar-
terback Ed since the latter was
home during the break between
semesters. Home is St. Clair, Pa.

However, from talking with

Mr. Morsillo and Angelo Ba-

racca-, Marty’s father, some kind

of story can be pieced together.

The four, using Lucci’s car, went

to the Morsillo’ home Friday

night. "They returned to school
that night and then left for
good Saturday morning.

They went to Baracca’s home in
Blairsville, ,Pa., Saturday after-
noon, ate lunch there and then
departed supposedly for Florida
about 2 pm.

-When the quartet was at Mor-
sillo’s home Friday night, Mr.
Morsillo attempted to ﬁnd out
what had happened. “I tried to
get them to talk,” Pat’s father re-
marked. “I said, "Now boys, spill
it out. If you did anything wrong,
let's get it straightened out’.”

“But all they said v;as~—fRead
it in the paper tomorrow.’ Pm
puzzled myself. I don’t know
_what to say. We haven’t heard
anything since. Lucci called his
home Sunday morning from

North Carolina. thoug .”

No one could be contacted at
the Lucci residence for further
information.

_Mr. Morsillo said that Mrs. Ba-
racca gave‘ Marty $100 and Lucci
received the same amount from
his father. “I wouldn’t‘ give Pat
any money,” the elder Morsillo
said. “I told him to stay here and
face‘ the music.” ‘ .

Mr. Sharockman, on the other
hand, is completely in the dark.
“We haven’t heard a word from
Ed,” the distraught father said.
“I don’t even know what hap-_
left school. All I know is what

“Last time I spoke to Ed (be-
tween semesters) he said that
everything was okay-—He was
established, was getting along
ﬁne, had good grades. I. thought
he was set. Then I picked up the
paper Sunday and saw that he
had withdrawn.”

Mr. Sharockman said that he is
very disappointed. f‘I don’t think,,
he should have left. If he was in

it. I don't know why» he didn't
call us.‘ Any other time, if he was
going to do something, he always
let us know, regardless of what
we thought. It's not like him.”

_ Mr- Baracca had only slightly
vmore to add to what Jim Mor-
sillo and Mike Sharockman
knew. “Their intention might

school down south. They, said
they were going to stop at dif-
ferent colleges along the way.”

He mentioned. as possibilities
where the four might try to enter
North Carolina, Miami and- Flor-

. ida State.

Mr. Morsillo has an idea that
Pat may want to enter the Uni-
versity of Florida. “Pat wanted
to go there when he graduated
from high school with another of
the Ambridge players. But the
other fellow didn't have the
grades and couldn’t go. So Pat
decided to go to Pitt." _ ’

Both Sharockman and- Morsillo
are eligible to apply for reinstate-
men" here. .

Many more applied. Not all were accepted.
In more than 200 U. 8. colleges, 14,436 college
sophomores met the high standards set. These
students were selected to continue officer
training in the advanced R.O.T.C. course.
Why didcach of these young men decide

one of the boys should come
through and do a good job.

The outﬁeld will be bolstered
by the return of hard hitting

‘After the appropriate expres-
-sions of greeting I gently pump
Scranton as to the reasons for his
presence in our respecta-ble sub-
urb. The Scranton, being as cau-
tious as a two-dollar better in the
third race on opening day, at-
~~tempts to hold out on his old busi-
--ness assoicate. So I shames him
into revealing the truth.-
The following is the truth,
according to the gospel, as I
heard it from Scranton Slim!
The whole company of traveling
actors‘ from the Great VVhite
VVay has accepted the kind in-
vitation from the University
drama contingent to entertain
the music and comedy addicts
‘in the vicinity.
These addicts, being of a breed
2 which is needing a high—powered
kick, demand a high-type produc-
tion. Thus, sparing no expense,
not even debt, the-whole gaudy
mob has been transported here
on the Red Arrow Limited, on the
sly. ' * ‘
Scranton travels. with Brandy
‘Bottle Bates, Harry the Horse,"
and Angie the Ox and arrives
here just on time to begin re- —

I am standing on the corner of Forbes and Oakland Aves.
two weeks ago, conversing with my esteemed friend, Gus
_Miller on the probabilities of the local ball team picking up
all the marbles this season, when .a gentleman strolls by,
limping obviously. This limp strikes middle C in my cranium
3 ~ and I immediately recognize this gentleman to be none other

lyn, will be the object upon which
all optics will be focused for the
show. His doll, Adelaide, featured
artiste at the Hot Box, on 42nd
at Broadway, hits the town via
Viscount and her job is to corral
Nathan, latter a 14 year engage-
ment. , 2
Nathan is still promoting the

“oldest established, permanent

‘The argument of the “morality
play” revolves about the Nathan-
Adelaide affair, and Sky’s remark-
able attachment to a straight

‘dame who plays Mother Rescuer

to the Bowery Bums—a mission-
ary, none other than.

nacle of the popularity indices
not so very long ago. “I’ve
Never Been, In Love Before,”
“If I Were A’Bell,” “Bushel and

the tunes which people have
been observed to whistle in
their sleep for months after ex-
posure. - _ _ ,_
