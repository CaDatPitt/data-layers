Pitt “rushed to judgment and

Democratic leaders push proposedAmerican Jobs Act

Brendan Owens
Staﬂ" Writer

Democratic leaders have ‘taken
to all corners of the country
to stump for President Barack
Obama’s newly proposed jobs bill,
including college campuses.‘

 ’. Democratic‘National Commit-

tee Chair, U.S. Rep. Debbie Was-

serman Schultz, D-Fla., and White
House staffer Kalpen Modi hosted
a conference call for collegiate
journalists Monday afternoon
to discuss 0bama’s proposed
American jobs Act and how it
may beneﬁt students across the
nation. The two ofﬁcials in the
call focused mostly on explaining
the merits of the bill and its aims,
rather than the speciﬁcs of how it
will accomplish them.

Obama began the push for the
bill with a speech two weeks ago,
which he has intended to jump-
start the nation’s economy. While
he emphasized that “nothing in
this bill should be controversial”
Republicans in both chambers of
Congress have criticized the bill

' and increased taxes on the rich

included in the proposal.

Schultz stressed in the call
the difﬁculties for college gradu-
ates and made clear that the
president’s bill would facilitate
a faster transition from college
to the workforce, but she didn’t
expound upon ‘how exactly the bill
would accomplish this.

“Right now there is a struggle

coming right out of college. There
are certainly no automatic oppor— ’
. tunities, so this bill would be more

hospitable to college graduates,”
Schultz said. “For young Ameri-

cans in particular, the American ._
Jobs Act will really make a differ- U
ence in the short—term and long— .

term employment.”

The White House website
states that the president’s act
would cut taxes for America’s
small businesses so that they can
hire employees and grow. The ﬁrst
$5 million in payroll tax would
be cut in half for 98 percent of
businesses and payroll tax would
be eliminated for ﬁrms that add
new workers to their payroll or
increase preexisting wages.

“Small business is the en‘-

gine of economic development,”
Schultzsaid.

According to the act, tax cuts

will be expanded to 160 million
workers who willreceive a 50
percent cut in payroll taxes in
2o12. This will_provide a $1,500
tax cut for the “typical family.”
The act lays out two programs
to put workers back to work. A
“Returning Heroes” hiring tax

credit has been proposed under '
that would provide tax credit to A

encourage the hiring of veterans.
A “Project Rebuild” would focus
on hiring people to work renovat-
ing homes and businesses. V "
“We are at our strongest when
everyone does their fair share
and everyone gets a fair shake,’-’
Schultz said of the $500 billion

-bill. “This bill-isfully paid for

in a fair way, including closing
corporate loopholes and asking
America’s wealthiest to pay their
fair share.” ~

The White House website said
Obama will call on ajoint Com-
mittee to come up with additional
deﬁcit reductions to pay for the

plan. A detailed plan will be re-
leased inthe next week.

Schultz advocated for the act
and stressed that it will create
more jobs and expand the econ-
omy instantly aswell as create

thousands of construction jobs to,
' ﬁx American infrastructure.

A
b

,‘‘It would make it easier for

_ workers to remain connected to

the workforce as well asgive them
skills for the future,” she said.
During the /half—hour confer-
ence call, Modi also discussed the
president’s full repeal of “Don’t

"Ask, Don’t Tell.”

“[The president has initi-

I ated] a full repeal of ‘Don’t Ask,

Don’t Tell’ so our friends that are
serving can [do so] without dis-
charge from that unfair policy,”
he said.

Schultz expressed adamantly
her desire for young adults to
have a voice in the political ‘arena

« through the bill."

“Young people have always

been an important voice in the

Democratic party,” she said. “I
got my own start in youth poli-

ties with the College Democrats.

I decided it was important that a
voice for young people was heard
in our political discussions.”

During the ﬁrst part of the call,
Modi pointed to the Affordable
Care Act as an example of Obama’s
past achievements.

“The Affordable Care Act led
to health care becoming more
affordable and accessible for
youngpeople,” Modi said. “A lot

» of folks in ‘college are beneﬁting

from that, especially folks that
are‘ graduating.” ,

Under the act, dependents can
stay on their parents’ plans until
they turn 26. ,

The act now provides 12 mil-
lion young adults with coverage.
But 30 percent of that demo-
graphic is still uninsured — a rate
that Modi said is higher than that
of any other group’s across the
board. V A
 7 C Modi said that Obama’s main
goal isto provide jobsand student -
aid for young adults.

“[It’s]‘ the pinnacle of what the
‘president wants to do, from how
student loans work, to predatory
lending,” he said. I

Pittsburgh Protocol reduces number of post-surgery drugs

UPMC 4 1

face transplants, said it could be
years before UPMC starts per-
forming face transplants because
the process for ﬁnding a compat-
ible donor is unpredictable.

“It could be tomorrow, six
months to a year or even longer,”
Gorantla said.

Doctors at UPMC developed
the Pittsburgh Protocol and have
used it to perform eight hand

' transplants on ﬁve patients over ,

a span of two years.

Gorantla said the recipient is
given the donor’s bone marrow
with a complement of stem cells
to increase the chance of recep-
tion.

The Pittsburgh Protocol is de-
signed to reduce the number of

T drugs that are taken by the recipi-

ent post—surgery.

The procedure only uses one
drug at lower doses post-surgery,
as opposed to the three—drug se-
quence used in other face trans-
plants, Gorantla said. The one
drug, tacrolimus, is given at low
doses as compared to other treat-
ments through the protocol.

Immunosuppressive drugs,

trick patients’ immune systems
into accepting foreign tissue, and
the patients must remain on the
drug sequence for the rest of their
lives. Gorantla said the purpose
of the UPMC method is to pro-
portionally reduce the risks as-
sociated with a lifetime of taking
multiple medications.

Gorantla said that risks for the
transplant include the side effects
associated with tacrolimus. These
include diabetes, high blood pres-
sure, high cholesterol, other organ
failure and — in extreme cases —
the development of cancer.

“[However], at the doses we
are using, we don’t see these side
effects,” Gorantla said.

The Pittsburgh Protocol has

'been used successfully in hand

transplants at UPMC so far, with
ﬁve patients currently on a low-
dosage of the immunosuppressive
drug and very few episodes of re-
jection, said the UPMC website.

Gorantla said that major ben-
eﬁts of this procedure includea
quick return to a normal life and
a seamless reintegration into so-
ciety. A

anther Card .
OW accepted   at    

An ideal candidate for a face
transplant is somebody who is
relatively young and healthy and
has no existing health problems
that could complicate the surgery
or compromise protocol, Gorantla
said. People with infections or vi-
ruses such as HIV cannot qualify
for a face transplant. V

The process for finding a
candidate includes a thorough
screening made up of various
psychological and psycho-social
tests. Screeners look into a po-
tential recipient’s motivation for

and expectations in receiving the‘

transplant as well as his or her
ability to comply with medica-

tion directives and psychologi-.

cally cope with the surgery. There

_ is currently one person on the list

waiting to receive a transplant.
The surgery is meant for peo-
ple who have devastating injuries
or facial deformities to the point
where the face doesn’t look or
function as it should and vital pro-
cesses such as breathing, tasting,
smelling or seeing are inhibited.

Hersh’s conﬁdence behind the podium.

During the question-and-answer ses-
sion, Hersh labeled himself ajeffersonian
in response to a question posed by an audi-
ence member asking if he thought it OK for
the government to keep secrets.

Hersh said he’s a staunch believer in the

ernment’s] job to keep the secrets, and it’s
my job to ﬁgure them out.”

In 1974 Hersh broke a story on the front
page of The New York Times about illegal
CIA ﬁles. He said he had found out that
the CIA was keeping ﬁles on 100,000 or
more Americans whom the organization
suspected of being dissidents. Only the
FBI is permitted by law to keep domestic

“You’ve got to publish that,” he said.

Hersh quelled one audience member’s
concern on the moral dilemma journalists
face when breaking controversial stories.
He said that when he’s writing a story with
potentially sensitive content, he often goes
to a trusted inside government source ﬁrst
to warn them.

He gave an example of the type of con-

versation he often has in such situations:



\

“Here’s what you did. There’s no way I’m
not writing about it. You better get your
people out of harms way,” he said.

As for the aspiring journalists in the
crowd, Hersh encouraged them to ﬁnd
truth for themselves through interpreta-
tion and scouring research and articles.

“The only truth is one that you come to
believe by your own personal experience or
your own personal reading,” he said.

English writing professor Cindy Skrzy-
cki arranged Monday’s lecture. Hersh’s
topics of discussion and advice dovetailed
with the content of two of her Pitt classes,
in which she teaches investigativejournal-
ism to her students.

“Nothing will surpass hearing Sy Hersh
stand in front of you,” Skrzycki said of the
face-to-face encounter with the veteran
reporter..

Kelly Posenau, senior and editor—in—
chief of Pitt Political Review, said she
came to hear the lecture because she heard
Hersh’s informal public lectures are rare.

"‘He’s had a huge inﬂuence on journal-
ism,” Posenau said.

“He’s an icon,” Skrzycki said. “His sto-
ries had a groundbreaking effect on public

policy.” %-

More to ACC
than sports

Pitt is set to join the‘ Atlantic
Coast Conference. That means
new competition in several dif-
ferent sports. That means leaving
an imploding Big East Conference.
But what does that mean outside
of the sports realm?

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
answered this question before
most fans even pondered it. At
Sunday night’s press meeting, he
discussed the academic beneﬁts
of switching conferences, such
as strengthening Pitt’s alliance
with Wake Forest. The two schools
collaborate on regenerative re-
search as part of the Wake Forest-

- Pittsburgh Consortium.

We know the switch didn’t take

. place for academic reasons. And

before we sound naive, we’ll note
that most of the proceeds that the

conference switch could generate .

will likely feed back through the
athletic department.

“This is not about playing Mo- _

nopoly and moving pieces around
on the board,” NCAA President
Mark Emmert told USA Today
about conference-switching.
“These are real institutions with
real students and real coaches
and real programs, and it’s much,
much morecomplex than playing
a simple game.”

We agree. And we are hope-
ful that moving to the ACC will

extend beneﬁts to Pitt that reach
beyond the sports ﬁelds, courts
and pools. .

Like Emmert said, it’s not just
about playing a game. And the

NCAA realizes that, too.

The NCAA’s Academic Progress
Rate system serves as an annual
academic progress report and
numerical indicator of Division I
collegiate athletics teams’ abilities
to graduate their student-athletes.
And the ACC is a leading force in
those rankings. .

Pitt ﬂoats in the middle of the
Big East pack as it is, but mov-
ing to the ACC could mean»bet-
ter things for athletes who aren’t
going pro. Student-athletes who
take note of the APR. system will
see that Pitt is becoming part of

a conference that dependably -

retains and graduates them. Af-
ter all, to most student-athletes,
college is important because of
the education —— and degree — it
provides. Period. ' '

We‘ hope Nordenberg meant
what he said Sunday night. Pairing

up to do research with the likes ' H

of Virginia Tech, Duke and UVA
would not only further increase
Pitt’s internationally renowned
reputation as a public-research

powerhouse — it would literally A if

make the world a better place.
And building this bond up and
down the Eastern Seaboard makes
it even easier for us to work to-
gether within our conference.

We think joining the ACC could
be the most important move Pitt
makes to assert itself as one of the
best colleges —-‘both academically
and athletically — in the country.
We just hope the academic aspect
isn’t thrown aside.‘I

THE SCHAFFIDAVIT

Pitt neglects wallet—wellness

Dean Humphrey should make personal ﬁnance part of ‘Healthy U’ campaign

.4
MCT Campus

According to one expert, this year’s average graduating senior will have accumulated $27,000 in student
‘ debt. He could use some honed money-management skills.

Matt Schaff
Columnist _

Dean Kathy Humphrey cares about
Pitt students, and by my calcula-
tion, there’s one more important
way she can — and should —— show
it. Along with priming students to
improve their personal and social
habits, Humphrey should engage
them in a money talk.

This past Wednesday, Hum-
phrey’s Division of Student Affairs
hosted an event called the “Healthy
U Fair,” which gathered undergrads
on the William Pitt Union lawn to
promote awareness of Pitt’s health-
related resources and emphasize
“seven dimensions of wellness,’’ ac-
cordinghto the division’s website.

" Hearing of the program, I, after ’,

spending years kvetchingly writing
off Humphrey’s Outside the Class-
room Curriculum like so many of
my classmates, prepared for disap-
pointment. But upon reading up on
these wellness “dimensions,” my
presumptions evaporated, leaving

a residue of mostly pleasant sur-
prise. Even if the lure of OCC credit
contaminated students’ reasons for
attending the fair, the Healthy U
initiative reﬂects a real and hon-
est attempt by the University to do
good for its students. The dimen-
sions, some of which include physi-
cal, emotional and environmental
wellness, are the right ones chosen
for the right reasons.

‘But without kind critics, even
well—intentioned programs will
fall short.’ That’s why, if the spirit
of civic duty indeed ﬂoats in the
skies over Oakland, I’m contribut-
ing: "Healthy U could improve by
inserting “personal ﬁnancial well-

ness” into its master list. With more

students struggling with ﬁnances
in the jobless non-recovery, Dean
Humphrey should recognize the
opportunity for compassion and
make some constructive noise.
There’s actually something
scarier than journalists using
cliches —— journalists using the
“cliche criterion” to protect their
front pages from thoroughly re-

ported stories that happen to have
critical importance for readers.

For example, where did Iraq War
coverage go? Similarly, loan debt,

exploding college tuition rates

and post—graduation employment
prospects are all topics that seem
to fail the “cliche criterion” these
days, especially among collegiate
op-ed writers. We’ve had years to
exhaust these opining opportu-

nities, and predictably the act of
moaning about our fellow students’
weakening ﬁnancials is approach-

ing editorial taboo.

But I don’t care.

Why? Because you don’t. Finan-
cial pressure on today’s college stu-
dents is rapidly growing, as if by
the hour.

First, it’s the cost. In a zero—in-
ﬂation, recessionary environment,
public universities are upping the
price of higher education at a terrif-
ic pace. For example, since last year,
Temple University raised tuition 10
percent, Pitt raised it 8.5 percent,

Program could ease
financial stress

Schaff 1 5

and the University of California
system used an 8 percent increase
to top off the increases of 9 and 32
percent that it implemented each of
the two years prior, respectively.

The second pressure, of course,
is the loans to pay for the costs. Ac-
cording to FinAid.org, every sec-
ond, the American population of
student borrowers owes an addi-
tional $2,853.88 in loans — a rate
that could push student loan debt
beyond the $1 trillion mark next
year. At the moment, studeiit» debt
breaks down to $27,00’0..peri‘gradu-
ating senior, ﬁnancial aide expert
Mark Kantrowitz told NPR.‘

And then, ﬁnally, it’s the absence
of jobs that — you might guess --
leads to failures to pay off the loans.
The conventional wisdom among
labor economists is that the U.S. job
market must add at least 150,000
positions per month to supply the

inﬂux of newcomers to the work— -

force — like, say, recent college
graduates. But thanks to ongoing
economic malaise, the economy
only added on average 40,000
workers per month since May,
according to the Bureau of Labor
Statistics. Last month, nearly three
years after Lehman Brothers col-
lapsed, the economy produced zero
jobs. So much for that. The situation
is so dire that default on student
loans — which by law follow you
till death do you part -— is becom-
ing more common. The New York
Times reports that the unthinkable
happened to 8.8 percent of borrow-
ers last ﬁscal year. That ﬁgure’s up
from 7 percent the previous year.
The issues underlying students’
ﬁnancial pressures cannot be re-
solved by Dean Humphrey. Student

Affairs might be powerful, but halt-
ing the explosion of college costs
and student debt requires broad-
swath cultural change, and the
going—nowhere unemployment
level demands intervention from
the highest office —— perhaps Presi-
dent Barack Obama’s jobs bill, if not
something more major.

Instead, Dean Humphrey can
use her political and organizational
prowess to jumpstart discussion of
personal ﬁnance on campus. Stu-

’ dents arrive at Pitt with virtually no

experience balancing checkbooks,
paying bills or living on a budget
(high schools usually don’t require
a personal ﬁnance class), and thus a
money-management program mar-
keted -in the Humphrey-style would
only see high demand, especially
from a student population now bur-
dened by unprecedented ﬁnancial

pressure. Pitt’s website does say that ’

the Academic Resource Center can

offer personal ﬁnance advice, but _

to my knowledge there is no stu-

The justiﬁcation for such a‘ program
would mirror the philosophy that

sity’s commitment to its students
should not end at infusing them
with academic knowledge, but at
providing resources that facilitate
healthy and happy lives. Combining
personal ﬁnance awareness with the
Healthy U initiative —— or any other

' campaign — is not only consistent

with Dean Humphrey’s‘ ideals, but
since students are under so much
economic stress, it’s the right thing
to do. '

After all, what’s more pertinent
of a “student aifair” than a student’s
wallet? I

“the others.” And yes, that is a ~

“Lost” reference.

1) Hermione turns out to be
the hot one. Finally! “Harry Pot-
ter” is a rare cultural phenome-
non that made the others join the

nerd club. Not only did it allow I

us to say “Wingardium Leviosa”

and be understood, but it gave

us the chance to agree with our

-“others” friends on a movie to _

see. Instead of pleading with ev-
eryone thatvWoody Allen is funny
(I swear he is!) or that Wes An-
derson makes sense (I swear he
does!), we could simply focus on
letting them know it’s not “LeviO-
sa,” it’s “LeviosA.” And you know
the nerd in the group? Hermione.
You know the one that turns out
to be hot? It’s not Draco. Hermi-
one went from squirrely to Jessica

you weren’t signing up for Potions

people who brought them to the

The 1983 movie “Flashdance” opens with
a young woman biking down the streets of
Pittsburgh, pedaling across the bridges and

’ through the South Side.

Jennifer Beals’ steelworker character is not
a real person, but an iconic personage from a,
Pittsburgh-made movie —-— one -among many
that have showcased the Steel City. ‘V ‘

But the journey from the inception of Pitts-
burgh’s movie-making industry to “Flash-
dance” was an arduous one, and it took even
longer for the city to make it to Christopher
Nolan’s “The Dark Knight Rises.”

The lights dimmed and the screen ﬂickered
on at the beginning of the 20th century on
Smithﬁeld Street in Pittsburgh, where the
ﬁrst movie theater in the country opened.
Its name, the Nickelodeon, comes from the

still attend the zombie walks in the Monro-
eville Mall commemorating Romero’s second
zombie ﬁlm, “Dawn of the Dead” (1978). ‘
But more than just Pittsburgh’s zombie
heritage pulls in movies such as “The Deer

Hunter” (1978), “The Silence of the 'Lambs”

(1991) and “Wonder Boys” (2000). .

Pitt professor and screenwriter of “St. .
Elmo’s Fire,” Carl Kurlander, and other writ- ‘

ers support the theory that it’s the everyman
perspective here in Pittsburgh that allows the
audience really to connect with characters.
“Pittsburgh has been my muse for ‘St. El-
mo’s Fire’ to what’s going on now,” Kurlander
said. “There are so many different kinds of

people and culture here in the city that really“

gives screenwriters the opportunity to create
memorable characters.” . -

Pittsburghers are ct hctrcl-“working,

blue-collar, no-nonsense group. We get

in, we get the job done, and we do it

right the first time.
-— Michael Sparks

price of a ticket — 5 cents — and a Greek
term denoting a theater —-— “odeon.”

When the theater opened in 1905, Pitts-
burgh and a few other cities ledthe national
ﬁlm industry. The reign was short~lived,
however, as hundreds of nickelodeons soon
opened up across the country. Hollywood
forgot Pittsburgh, and the city remained on
the whole an undiscovered movie-making
jewel until the ’60s, when the next big thing
hit the silver screen: zombies.

In 1968, George Romero’s classic zombie
thriller “Night ofthe Living Dead” came alive
and changed the industry in a profound way.
All of a sudden, independent ﬁlms with low
budgets were possible thanks to the vision
and dedication of Romero. Not only did Hol-
lywood get a wake-up call to this new style
of ﬁlm, but Pittsburgh itself also gained an
important aspect: a cult association with the
zombie apocalypse. _

To this day, fans from around the country

Pitt and Pittsburgh Filmmakers alumnus
Michael Sparks has worked on independent
ﬁlms like “Graduation” (2007) and now works
on his own screenplays based in Pittsburgh.

“Pittsburghers are a hard-working, blue-
collar, no-nonsense group,” Sparks,said. “We
get in, we get the job done, and we do it right
the ﬁrst time. You’d be amazed at how many
places don’t instill those kinds of values in
their people.” 9

The Steel City can be described as a hot
spot for the entertainment industry. The coun-
try’s ﬁrst radio station, KDKA, its ﬁrst public
television station, WQED, and ﬁrst movie the-
ater all originated here.

Pittsburgh has even given Hollywood a
few of its stars: Michael Keaton from “Bat-
man” (1989). Jeff Goldblum from “Jurassic
Park” (1993) and Rob Marshall, director of
“Chicago” (2002) to name a few — and the
list keeps on going. '

Money matters draw movie—makers to Steel City

Written By” Patrick Wagner

A father and a son walking through the
harsh conditions of a desert wasteland, a
Chicago-like city with a dark and sinister
underworld —‘ the Pittsburgh featured in
ﬁlms is an ever—changing landscape.

“It can stand in for anywhere east of the
Mississippi, but at the same time has char-
acter of its own,” Pitt in Hollywood adviser
Carl Kurlander said.

Pittsburgh is experiencing a cinematic

renaissance, as major ﬁlm productions once I

again seek the advantages of the city’s movie

industry with movies like “The Dark Knight

Rises,” “Zack and Miri Make a Porno,” “The
Road” and “The Perks of Being a Wallﬂow-
er.” What brings Hollywood ﬁlmmakers like
Christopher Nolan and Tony Scott to Pitts-
burgh isn’t just its status as a livable city,
but its status as a city with a vibrant ﬁlm
infrastructure. '

Film productions have come to Pittsburgh
since the days of the steel mills, but histori-
cally, the inﬂux of Hollywood productions
has been a more measured occurrence.

“It comes and goes,” said Brady Lewis,

"66

came after the introduction of Pennsylvania’s
Film‘Tax Credit in 2007, which offers a 25

percent tax credit for ﬁlms that “spend at I

least 60 percent of their production budget

' in the Commonwealth.” Before the tax credit

went into effect, even Pittsburgh zombie

‘legend George Romero was forced to shoot

elsewhere. _ ~

“Romero had made ﬁlms here all his life,”
Kurlander noted. “But he couldn’t shoot
‘Land of the Dead’ [2005] in Pittsburgh be-
cause of the cost, so he ended, up shooting
it in Canada.” Notable for its favorable tax
incentives, Canada has long attracted pro-
ductions from the United States.

“During the late ’90s, movies were ﬂock-
ing to Canada due to their tax incentives and
government rebates,” said Mike Matesic,
president of entertainment labor union In-
ternational Alliance of Theaterical Stage
Employees Local 489. The union represents
ﬁlm crew positions from construction to
video playback in Pittsburgh and has seen
the change ﬁrsthand since the tax credit
was instituted.

“In 2006 our union had just over 100

We had a big boom in the early 1990s

there's something going on again.

—- Brady Lewis

director of education for Pittsburgh Film-
makers. “We had a big boom in the early
1990s that lasted for a few years, There was
almost nothing for a while, and now there’s
something going on again.”

That ﬁrst boom occurred after a series of
strikes in New York City made movies more
expensive to produce there. With_Pittsburgh

east, Hollywood started to take interestfln
an effort to realize that interest, the Pitts-
burgh Film Office spun off from the Greater
Pittsburgh Office of Promotion to help bring

“From around 1990 to 1993 we had a new
inﬂux of productions,” Jessica Conner, the
Film 0fﬁce’s assistant director, said. “There
was a need for one group to oversee things
while those productions were here.”

members,” Matesic said. “In the ﬁrst three

years [after the credit] it grew to well over .

300 members  We’re working steady be-
cause of the tax credit.” And they’re not
the only ones beneﬁting from the recent
surge.

From Gavin O’Conner’s “Warrior” to Pat-
rick Lussier’s “My Bloody Valentine 3-D,”
ﬁlmmakers have looked to the Pittsburgh
area as an economical solution to the expen-
sive process of movie-making, and accord-
ingly, the city’s brought in more than $100

g millionin the last year alone for the city.

government officials considered putting
the $75 million budget for the incentive on
the chopping block after last year’s budget
deﬁcit.

This summer Christopher Nolan’s “The Dark Knight Rises” took over several locations
in Pittsburgh, including Oakland (the Mellon Institute on Craig Street) and sections of
Downtown, to create the dark Gotham City. Though the cityscape is based off Chicago,
Pittsburgh’s chameleon qualities made it an ideal setting for the ﬁlm.

for the budget proposal this past March,
noting that the ﬁlm industries in Pennsylva-
nia’s cities ‘_‘need a government that knows
enough not to shout, ‘Cut,’ in the middle of
production.”

Pointing to its importance — the tax
credit has provided around 4,000 jobs
around the state according to a legislative
study — legislators renewed the program.

“Films are brought here today for dif-
ferent reasons,” Conner said, “but ﬁrst and
foremost is the ﬁlm tax credit.” Though not
all ﬁlms use the credit, like “The Dark Knight
Rises.”

Although tax incentives are part of what
makes Pittsburgh an economical place to
make a movie, those “different reasons”
within the city also play a major role in cel-
luloid centurions bringing their visions to
the world’s movie screens. '

“Way back [in 1991], movies came to
Pittsburgh because of our locations, lower
rates and our crews,” Matesic said.

Nancy Mosser, a casting director who has
worked in Pittsburgh for 20 years, reﬂected
on the continuing draw those attractions
provide for ﬁlmmakers.

“They’re coming here for the same reason
that they shot ﬁlms here in the ’90s,”‘Mosser
said. “The crews are really really good. They

.1’ H

can do three movies here at once and still
have enough experienced crew people to
handle it.”

As an educator at Pittsburgh Filmmak-
ers, Lewis is a part of one of the reasons
Pittsburgh is at the top of many producers’
lists: for the body of trained professionals
available in the city.

“For 40 years, people have been getting
training at Filmmakers,” he said. “Most of the
pool of people who work in the industry here
have to come through here in some way or
another earlier in their career.” Institutions
like Filmmakers, the entertainment union
Local 489 and more recent introductions
like Kurlander’s Steeltown Entertainment
Project have helped to maintain the base of
trained professionals that once worked with
Mister Rogers and George Romero.

’ “A lot of productions will come in with
their pages or their production designers,
but they hire the entire art department 10-
cally,” Conner said. “-We have a crew here
that’s able to work on these productions
and provide that backup when needed.” The
art department decides the aesthetics ofthe
ﬁlm like how the buildings will work in the
background.

Those art departments might be asked
to evoke Pittsburgh, but they also might be

asked to represent somewhere else entire-
ly. That variable aesthetic is an advantage.
Western Pennsylvania became a barren land
for “The Road” and mimicked Chicago in
“The Dark Knight Rises.”

Lewis cited another reason for Pitts-
burgh’s popularity with on-location pro-
ductions: “When you shoot on location, you
do a lot of modiﬁcation to make sure what
you’re shooting looks how you want it to,”
Lewis said. “That’s something Pittsburgh
has as a location. It can look like a lot of
different places.”

I The city of Gotham in Christopher No-
lan’s “Batman” series, for example, has been
generally constructed around the look of
Chicago. For the purposes of ﬁlming “The

Dark Knight Rises,” the abundanturban ,

architecture around Pittsburgh was adapted
and incorporated into that world.
Although Pittsburgh is adept at playing
other cities, it has gladly found itself type-
cast as Pittsburgh. In addition to “Batman,”
movies set around the city —— “The Perks
of Being a Wallﬂower” and “Steel Town”
— also have been produced here. Kenny-
wood played a ﬁctionalized version of itself,
complete with a Pitt reference, in “Adven-
tureland,” written by Pittsburgh Filmmak-
ers alumnus Greg Mottola. DirectorKevin
Smith represented Monroeville’s zombie
heritage on the hockey j erseys of “Zack and
Miri Make a Porno” ,—- his second ﬁlm made
in the city after 1999’s “Dogma.” ,
Pittsburgh’s movie infrastructure ul-
timately brings ﬁlmmakers to the area.

if Tax incentives pull ﬁlms and revenue to ’Burgh

than ever. According to the Pittsburgh Film
Ofﬁce, they’re creating economic beneﬁts for
the area in both measurable and unquantiﬁ-‘
able ways.

Conner said that since the ﬁlm office
opened in 1990, ﬁlm production companies
have spent $560‘ million in the region. Last
year, the area took in about $100 million
and she estimates there will be more this
year because of “The Dark Knight.”Beyond
what’s quantiﬁable by the city, ﬁlm produc-
tions stimulate the economy in numerous
other ways. A :

“We don’t track numbers for people go-
ing out after work and grabbing a beer, or
when a family comes in and goes to the zoo
or go to the mall to buy a birthday present,”
Conner said. “We don’t track that, but you

have to ﬁgure a ﬁlm like ‘DKR’ has over 400

crew members who have days off and spend
their money locally.” ’
The livability of Pittsburgh has continued

. to pull productions from the entertainment

behemoth even 20 years after New York City
ushered in Pittsburgh’s last ﬁlm boom.
“Even just-the general cost of being in
Pittsburgh is better than bringing your
crew to New York,” Lewis said. Mosser
praised Pittsburgh as a place great for
more than just movie-making — appar-
ently ﬁlmmakers love it too. .
“.I’m happy that I get to do this kind
of work in.Pittsburgh,” she said. “I didn’t
have to move to New York or L.A. I can
still work in a pretty small city that’s
friendly and easy to get around in, but
I can work on major feature ﬁlms in

the process. I get to do that work right _

here.” I '

Dixon, Graham react to ACC move

Art u"!/iréssmlt

Pitt basketball coach Jamie Dixon said Pitt’s success as a basketball program doesn’t depend on its

Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editor

Someone was going leave, Pitt just
moved on ﬁrst.

That’s what head basketball coach
Jamie Dixon had to say at a news con-
ference on Monday addressing an-
nouncement that Pitt and Syracuse
are leaving the Big East for the Atlan-
tic Coast Conference. Dixon said that
Athletic Director Steve Pederson kept
abreast of the changing landscape of
college athletics. Last week, Pitt real-
ized itwas time to make a move.

“-Chancellor Nordenberg, Steve

[Pederson] and I made every effort
and I think [we] wish that the Big East
was going to stay together and grow

getbetter and add moreteams,” Dixon '
said. “But we also knew that therewas ,

going to be the possibility of realign-
ment, that we might be the team that

moves on.” 0

He added that attempting to build
a conference ofboth football and non-
football schools is difficult and created
problems when Pitt attempted to bol-
ster the Big East. Nordenberg and Ped-
erson spent “every waking moment”
trying to strengthen the conference,
he added.

“We did everything we could to
make the Big East better for a number
of years, but at that point a decision
had to be made,” Dixon said.

Dixon, entering his ninth year as

" _Pitt’s head basketball coach, said he

always felt the ACC would be the best

' ﬁt if Pitt ever moved.

When Pitt and Syracuse joined the
ACC, the move signaled the end of the
16-team Big East basketball conference
widely consideredthe best league inthe
country. But Dixon said that Pitt would
build rivalries inthe ACC the same way

conference.

the Panthers built meaningful competi-
tion with teams like Connecticut and
Villanova. ,

“We have so many rivals in [the Big
East] that weren’t our rivals four, ﬁve
years ago,” he said. “We’ll have a lot of
BigEastteamsthataregoingtobewith
us intheACC. Insomeways, it’s almost
goingto be former Big East and ACC
schools when we get to that poin ”

The ACC is already home to former
BigEast schools VirginiaTech, Boston
College and Miami (Fla.), who left the
Big East during conference realign-
ment in 2004.

Asked ifhe wanted Connecticut and
Rutgers —— two teams rumored to be
ACC targets —— to follow Pitt and Syra-
cuse, Dixon said he would let the ACC
commissioner make those decisions.

“I think [the ACC organizers] feel
they improved their conference with
the additions, and if they feel that two

 

morewill improve the conference, then
they’ll do thataswell,” he said. “Those
guys know what they’re doing.”

The momentum and success that
the Pittbasketballprogrambuiltduring
the last 10 years will continue with the
move to the ACC, Dixon said.

“We needto continue to make [the
program] better,” he added. “That’s
what we strive to do everyday, and we’ll
continue to do so movingforward. It’s
up to us, not what conference we’re
in or what conference we’re going to
be in.”

He said that he also doesn’t an-
ticipate any problems transferring
the Panthers’ style of play to the ACC.
Many view the Panthers —— and other
members of the Big East Conference
—-asplayingwitharougher stylethan
teams in other conferences.

“No matter what, if you’re from
Pittsburgh andyou have success, you’re
going to be a physical, tough, defen-
sive-minded team even though we’ve

been No. 1 in the country in offensive ‘ '

eﬂiciencyg” Dixon said. “We’ll adapt.
We’ve been very good offensively, but
we’restill1<nownastheteamthatbeats
people up-”

. Dixon doesn’t anticipate the move
will affect his recruiting style, either.

 Pitt has never focused on one speciﬁc

city or state to recruit, he said, noting
that the Panther coaches focus on the
player, notthearea. —

Asked ifthe unknovvnt1'metable for
the move had an effect on recruiting,
Dixon said he wanted to see how the
conference situation played out in the
next few weeks. Right now, Pitt and
Syracuse have to wait 27 months to
ofﬁcially join the ACC because of Big
East regulations.

“I think there is going to be some
conference realignment, so I think
that’s going to answer some ques-
tions and then we’ll go forward,” he
said. “We’re recruiting so fardown the
road, anyway. We’llbe adaptable andbe
aware of what’s going on.”

Head football coach Todd Graham
said he’s excited about the recruiting
opportimities that the ACC opens to
the football program.

“I think it’s very difﬁcult to recruit
a place that you don’t have,” he said.
“Playinginthe ACC is goingto allowus

Haywood would have received

FOOTBALL

Fitzgerald, McCoy stand

Sean Corrado
For The Pitt News

‘Former Panthers didn’t disappoint in

week two of the NFL season as Larry
Fitzgerald and LeSean McCoy led the
way for Pitt football alumni.

Fitzgerald (Pitt WR, 2oo2—2oo3)
caught seven passes for 133 yards and a
touchdown for the_Arizona Cardinals,
doubling his week—one yardage. Yet the
performance was not enough to give Ari-
zona a win, as the team fell to Washing-
ton in a nail—biter, 22-21.

The final touchdown came on a 73-
yard completion from quarterback Kevin
Kolb, a sign of great things to come for
the new duo. Kolb was nailed as he re-
leased his throw to a wide—open Fitzger-
ald along the sideline. Fitzgerald’s abil-
ity to get open easily pairs with Kolb’s
strong, accurate arm. _

McCoy (Pitt RB, 2007-2008) again
gave a fine performance but came home
without a victory. His Eagles lost to At-
lanta 31-35. Aside from the loss, Mc-
Coy is proving to NFL fans_that he is
not going to go through a “sophomore
slump” in his second year as a full—time
starter. ,

After his fine 122—rushing-yard per-

Former Pitt and current Eagles running back LeS”ean McCoy ran for 116 yards‘ and two
touchdowns on 22 carries against Atlanta on Sunday.

formanceliin week one, McCoy gained»

116 total yards (95 yards rushing, 21 re-

ceiving) on 22 touches and two red zone

scores in weekptwo. He demonstrated
more of his power this week, bursting

through tacklers—”at the goal line — the

same fate the’B‘igiEa~st tacklers met when
trying to bring him down in 2008.
’.Mc,Coy’sjr'ookie teammatie, Dion“Lew-
is (Pitt RB,”2009-2010), did not receive
any touches offensively but did receive
somespecial teams play. ‘

On the defensive side ofthe ball,Jets '

cornerback Darrelle Revis (Pitt CB,
2004‘-';2Q‘j06)' led New York’s defense to
a 32-2‘ rout ofjacksonville, as the Jets

Revis ended the game with three to-
tal tackles and held the Jaguars’ No, 1
wideout, Mike Thomas, to only three
catches for 29 yards.

finished the game with five total tackles‘

in a 27-19 win.

He said that the program’s focus would still
remain on bringing in the “best and brightest”
from Pennsylvania and Ohio —— players that are
as“gas tank’s drive away.” I '

But he added that the move to the ACC could
help bring in those local athletes as well.

“Perception is reality, and perception is that
this is a big-time move up for us,” Graham said.
“Kids are very impressionable when it comes to
conference affiliations.” B ’

But the Big East is a lot better than the per-
ceptions of it, Graham added, and Pitt will be

able to compete in the ACC. He said the larger
league —— the ACC will have 14 teams while the
Big East football conference had just eight --
won’t make it more difficult for Pitt to reach a
BCS bowl game.

“I thinkthat type ofleague makes everything
better,” he said. “Instead one BCS team, you’ll
wind up havingtwo.” 

But moving to the ACC also means leaving
behindahistoric rivalinwestvirginia. 'I‘hisyear,
the Panthers and the Mountaineers will play the

“I’mtraditionalist. I love college football. I have

But with the potential end of one important

He said he’s at Pitt to build a championship

“The top opponents thatwe are going to play I

Suit separate

ages, attorneys’ fees and court costs.
Buzbee said that they “bent over back-
wards” in attempt to reach, an agreement
with Pitt. The attorney also said he and
Haywood met with Pitt ofﬁcials in a meet-

ing at which Pitt ofﬁcials admitted that the ‘

institution had promised to pay Haywood’s
buyout.

“Mr. "Haywood said that if they paid the
buyout, he would drop the whole thing,”
Buzbee said. “And they wouldn’t do that.”

He described the attitude of Pitt ofﬁcials
as “ﬂippalnt” and added that the meeting was
a wasted trip, saying that Pitt didn’t gather
any of the information it was supposed to.

Buzbee said several letters exchanged

’ with the University proved unsuccessful in
helping the situation and that Haywood de-
cided not to drop the issue.

. “We did everything we-could to avoid this
lawsuit,” Buzbee said.

I The announcement of the lawsuit comes
nearly a month after the Pennsylvania Hu-
man Relations Commission opened an of-
ﬁcial investigation into a complaint ﬁled by
Haywood. Buzbeesaid the lawsuit doesn’t
concern the PHRC or the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission. ,

The complaint‘ ﬁled with PHRC alleged
_a racial motivation for Haywood’s ﬁring,
although injuly Buzbee said that the primary
issue into the investigation was Haywood’s
termination without due process.

Haywood ﬁled the complaint with the
PHRC on Aug. 1. PHRC spokeswoman Shan-
non Powers said on Aug. 16 that since the
PHRC opened the official investigation, that
public information is limited to the com:
plaint from Haywood. ’

At the conclusion of the ‘investiga-
tion, which could take up to a year, the
PHRC would reach one of two ﬁndings:
probable cause or no probable cause.
If there is probable causelof discrimination,
Powers said there would be one last effort
to settle and then the case would proceed
to a public hearing. If there is no probable

cause, the ﬁling party is notiﬁed and has

10 days to put forth further information.
The new information is reviewed in a prelimi-
nary hearing and if no cause is found, the party
is informed of his right to ﬁle the case in court.

A Under state law, the party must allow PHRC _

one year to investigate the claim. If the case
is still open after one year, the party is noti-
ﬁed so that he can ﬁle a case in the court of
common pleas. .

At a court hearing on Feb. 11, Haywood
entered a court diversion program in Indi-
ana, which requires 60 hours of community
service and a psychological evaluation.
