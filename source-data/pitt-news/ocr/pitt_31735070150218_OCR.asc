Chemistry students build ‘smart’ drugs

A team of Pitt undergraduates could
soon ﬁnd a new way to ﬁght can-
cer and simultaneously control the
harmful effects of nuclear fallout.
Under the guidance of Paul Flo-
reancig, a professor in the Depart-
ment of Chemistry, three Pitt seniors
majoring in chemistry are building
a microscopic drug-delivery system
that could have wide-ranging ap-
plications for human health.
“What they are doing is tryingto
make smart drugs,” Floreancig said.
Second-year natural sciences
students commonly dread organic
chemistry exams, but nothing wets
the palms more than one kind of test
question: organic synthesis. Having
to propose step-by-step roadmaps
from simple starting materials to
complex molecules, students must
carefully mix creativity with aca-

demic mastery, and such demands
can overwhelm many.

But not Akira Shimizu, Stepha-
nie Garrell andsuzanne Principe,
who day after day in Floreancig’s
laboratory follow much the same
process of molecular engineering.
The difference is that in their case,
no teacher can tell them the right
answer.

“A lot of times with organic re-
search, you’re working with mol-
ecules that no one worked with
before,” said Shimizu, who started
contributing to this project for his
summer Brackenridge Fellowship,
an interdisciplinary research award
for Pitt undergraduates funded by
the University Honors College.

Armed with a panoply of chem-
icals and equipment, the student
team is set on building molecules
that have never existed. The pro-
posed application is just as ambi-
tious: to produce drugs that selec-
tively affect their biological targets

without touching other parts of the
body.

“The end result is getting them
into cells and seeing how they react
toward their target,” said Garrell,
who, alongwith Principe, joined the
project this semester. Such insight
could then translate into better ways
to conduct chemotherapy and pro-
tect from nuclear radiation.

But testing the team’s molecular
products in cell cultures, let alone
animals or humans, is a long way
off. They have to ﬁrst make the
products.

In the chemistry students’ case,
the desired products are new kinds
of “prodrugs.” Unlike traditional
pharmaceuticals that enter the
body in active form, a prodrug can
only elicit its therapeutic effect after
one or more biochemical processes
convert the drug to its active form.
Prodrugs have reached widespread

Dr. Thomas Starzl enjoyed the Fourth
ofjuly weekend relaxingvvith his wife
and six dogs in the country. It wasn’t
until he returned home afew days lat-
er that he noticed ahandﬁil ofunread
emails — emails sentfrom Britain and
Dallas, each askingwhy he hadn’tyet
responded. “Responded to what?”
Starzlwondered.
Scrolling back to an email dated
June 30, Starzl learned the reason
he was in demand. The former Pitt
professorhad been namedthisyear’s
recipient ofthe Lasker-DeBakey Clini-
cal Medical Research Award forhis in-
novative workinlivertransplantation.
Starzl will accept the Lasker
Award, which recognizes scientists

who have made major advancements
inthe medical world, with University
of Cambridge’s Dr. Roy Calne laterthis
week. According to the Lasker Foun-
dation’s website, 81 Lasker laureates
have "also received the Nobel Prize.
Starzl attempted the ﬁrst human

Although his ﬁrst several liver patients
died within days of their surgeries,
Starzl quickly improved the procedure
to allow patients to live for years after.

  Veterans oﬂice without
program director

Megan Trimble .
Stqff Writer

Pitt student veterans can print papers
in David Lawrence Hall or grab abite
to eat in the Union, but if they walk
into the Office ofveteran Services on
the fourth ﬂoor of the Cathedral of
Learning, they won’t be able to speak
with a program director.

Since November 2011, the Office
of Veteran Services has been operat-
ing with a limited staff. Despite con-
versations between the administra-
tion and studentveterans on campus,
the University is still in negotiations
to ﬁnd the OVS a director.

“A search has been under way.
for some time for a new director of
veteran services at Pitt,” University
spokesmanjohn Fedele saidinregard

to issues raised bythe Pitt Student
Veteran Association. “An offer was
extended on [Sept. 10] to an excit-
ing candidate who also happens to
be aveteran.

Fedele offered no further informa-
tion on the candidate.

William Cole, president of Pitt’s
SVA, approached the Faculty Senate
Committee on Sept. 4 to present four
main issues facing student veterans
at the University. Chief among them
was the need for a director and pro-
gram assistant in the OVA —- an of-
ﬁce currently staffed by coordinator

Janet Owens and beneﬁts coordinator
Dennis Renner.

Cole’s presentation also outlined

the need for a veterans’ transition

course, a veterans’ resource center and an in-
crease in the means of communication from
the SVA to student veterans throughout the
University.

Cole said that a veterans’ transition course
would help refresh veterans on skills that are
necessary for becoming a successful student.

Studentveteran Sean Rohrer joined the SVA
to ease his transition back into the University
and to connect with other veterans. As a 24-year-
old sophomore and, prior to attending Pitt, a
former combat veteran of about ﬁve years, he

ﬁnds himselfhaving to releam basic academic .

skills that many would ﬁnd to be second nature.

“One of the biggest things that I’ve found
challenging is picking up basic math again,”
Rohrer said. “[As a student veteran] you are
coming back after ﬁve plus years without hav-
ing done simple math, and now I have to take
algebra or higher—level math.”

Rohrer said it’s quite a transition to go
from working in the ﬁeld to schooling, where
a physical approach must be transformed into

an academic one.

“When you are in the military you have one
way of thinking, and there is a certain way of
doing things. You are given atask, and nobody
gets home until you’re done,” he said. “But in
school you have several

The national organization is designed to

and Cole said thatveteran suicide stands as one
of the biggest concerns facing veterans today.

He added that a way to mitigate the situa-
tion is to provide individuals with social and
academic support as they transition from the
military back into civilian life. .

In many cases, Cole said, changes‘ such as
preferential course scheduling would help to
alleviate some of the stresses thatveterans face.

“For example, we had a guy get out of the
Marine Corps, and two months later he’s going
to school. He doesn’t know anyone, he doesn’t
know much about the courses, and he doesn’t
knowwho are good professors to take,” he said.
“So by the time that his registration opens, he
is kind of behind in relation to everyone else.”

And in some cases, veterans do not receive
the academic credit they thinkthey deserve for
their time spent in the service.

Rohrer was certiﬁed as an EMT with a spe-
cializaﬁon in trauma, but the University granted
him only one credit in physical education for
his service. He found himself as one of the last
people signing up for fall classes this semester,

clinical use, from treating high blood pressure
to cancer: The idea for chemotherapy is for the
drug to become toxic when it hits cancer cells,
sparing normal cells. _

Despite their preponderance, the prob-
lem with prodrugs is that their structures lack
generalizability. That’s because, most often,
researchers construct them with only the in-
dicated purpose in mind, reinventing most of
the wheel each time.

In contrast, Shimizu, Garrell and Principe
want to fashion a common, customizable
wheel.

“What we’re trying to do is make one where
it is easy to change  what drug you’re deliv-
ering, to change what you’re targeting and
change what sets it off,” Shimizu said. "

In that end, the undergraduate team is busy
synthesizing several templates of prodrugs,
built of three molecular “groups” capable of
customization. Leaning heavily on scientiﬁc

. literature for procedural clues, the students

spend lab time assembling the groups through
a series of sequential chemical reactions, puri-

. fying the intermediate products and conﬁrm-

ing they got what they intended.

Once combined in multifunctional mol-
ecules, the “targeting” group would attach
to the area of interest, the “triggering” group

would convert the drug into active form, and

the “cargo” group would deliver the payload —
the substance that actually changes, protects
or kills the target.

After basic preparations prove" effective
and viable — the group hopes to be ‘ready
for cellular testing by..December — scientists
elsewhere could modify the different “groups”
to ﬁt their respective therapeutic objectives.

“It’s avery generalized approach to deliver-
ing different molecules to different environ-
ments,” Floreancig said.

That could mean eliminating many kinds of
cancer cells, but it could also mean safeguard-
ing mitochondria, a critical cellular component
affected by nuclear radiation. Experimental
evidence suggests that mitochondria exposed
to radiation increase production of reactive
oxygen species, which are unstable particles
that, in high amounts, tear cells apart. Thus,
there’s a big push to ﬁnd ways to deliver drugs
that counteract these species to mitochondria
in tissues especially vulnerable to radiation,
like bone marrow.

Drugs like that could be quickly distributed
to people after a nuclear emergency, according
to Joel Greenberger, chair of the Department
of Radiation Oncology and leade_r of the cam-
pus—wide grant from the National Institutes of
Health that partially funds Floreancig’s work.

“The main aim of the grant is to develop
small molecules to be used as radiation miti-
gators,” Greenberger said. “These would be
drugs that can be given to people after radia-
tion events to try to protect their bone marrow
and their gastrointestinal systems. This would
be for willful acts of terrorism.”

neering takes time andfocus. Shimizu, Garrell"

drug—— cyclosporine, which acts as an immuno-
suppressant and helps prevent rejection during
transplant surgeries.As a result, liver transplants
are performed today all across the world, and
survival rates have increased from zero to be-
tween Bo and 90 percent.

Dr. Abhinav Humar, Clinical Director of the
Thomas E. Starzl Transplantation Institute at
Pitt, said that Starzl is an iconic ﬁgure in the ﬁeld
of transplantation.

“Just about anyone in the ﬁeld will know his

name,” he said. “Well, not just about everyone’

—— everyone.” I

Starzl began teaching as a professor 

gery at the University’s School of Medicine in
1981. He said that Pittsburghwas an educational
center for transplantation at the time.

“As of the 1980s, Pittsburgh was the only
place in the Americas that offered liver trans-
plantation as a service,” he said.

Starzl spent the greatest portion ofhis career
at Pitt, although he also spent substantial time
at the University of Colorado.

During his time at Pitt, Starzl said, he taught
hundreds of students and watched many of them
accomplish great things. He said that one of the
most important lessons he taught his students

’ was how to treat patients.

“I wanted students to learn how to compas-
sionately take care of sick patients, and how to

"do it skillfully with a high degree of integrity,”

 39...“...

he said.

One of Starzl’s former students and colleague
ofmore thanzo years, Dr. Wallis Marsh, said that
the most importantlesson Starzltaughthimwas
the importance of perseverance.

“When I was in medical school they called
him Dr. Frankenstein. The world was against
him, but he didn’t give up,” he said.

Humar said that Starzl advanced inthe ﬁeld
at such a fast pace because ofhis relentless pur-
suit. ;:     a 4  u -

in the early times when there might have be

“I’m always thinking about when I can ‘get’ ‘

Marsh attributes many of Starzl’s achievements.
“As mere morfals,we make mistakes because

s ould embrace progress

Tiemoko Ballo
For The Pitt News

On Sept. 5, BitTorrentInc. released
uTorrent, the mostwidelyused torrent
client in the Western world, on An-
droid smartphones and tablets. Now
anyAndroid device can joinuTorrent’s
150 million users and engage in peer-
to-peer ﬁle sharing on the go.

Thismarksamajorstepforward—
orbackward, depending onyourpoint
of view — for mobile devices, since

there aren’tmanyhighqua]ity, ﬁ1ll-fea- .

ture alternatives to uTorrent available,
and previous apps onlyallowed remote
control of a uTorrent desktop client.
The iPad and iPhone won’t be 
part anytime soon because Apple’s
strict app approval process erqalicitly
outlaws torrent clients because oftheir
association with piracy.

Whether you have a strict moral
opposition to digital piracy, oryou’re an
advocate oflntemet freedom, this de-
velopment warrants some reﬂection.
As peer-to-peer ﬁle sharing becomes
even more widespread—now hitting
mobileAndroid devices —we have to
take a closer look at the nature of piracy
and its ramiﬁcations.

Manywould argue that piracyis an
immoral crime that is no better than
shopliﬁing. These people would argue
that lazy and greedy people engage in
piracy to avoid spending money and
that these same people would have
made legitimate purchases provided

that a method of piracy had not been
available.

I say all of those things are untrue.
Piracy is not intrinsically wrong. It is
a response to a new medium. It is the
effect of widespread technological
advance. Moreover, piracy is a direct
catalyst for innovation, for progress.
Piracy is good forbothbusinesses and
consumers because itforces adaptation
and leads to new methods of distribu-
tion.

Harvard professor Clayton M.
Christensen coined the famous term
“disruptive technologr.” The phrase
refers to a radical new way of doing
things, anadvance so drastic it disrupts
traditional business methods and dis-
places earliertechnology. The Internet
is the ultimate example of this phe-
nomenon. Peer-to-peer piracy is just
one small side effect of the Internefs
disruption and of the extreme avail-
ability of free information. Piracy is a
waytoutilize anexcitingnewinforma-
tion inﬁast:ruct11retl1atdidn’texist2o

And when disruptive technology
hits, businesshasto adapt. Innovation

There are two kinds of companies
inthe InternetAge. Theﬁrstkind com-
plains about piracy reducing its sales,
spends resources hunting and penal-
izingpirates and lobbies foranti—piracy
legislation that will hurt its consum-
ers. The second kind ﬁnds new and
creative ways of delivering its product

that reduce the appeal of piracy, spends
resources improving its consumers’
experiences and earns their business.
Several industry—leading companies
have taken advantage of the Internet
to deliver their products in new ways
thataredeser-vingoi‘hard—earned cash.
App1e’s i'I‘unes, which allowed people
to download MP3s instead of having

retailer, has been so hugely success-
ful it’s almost killed physical media
in the music indusuy. Netﬂix, which
allows Internet streaming of movies
and TV shows, has largely replaced
movie rental stores and DVD shipping
services. Steam, which allows for the
digital purchase and download ofvideo
games, has gainedaloyalfollowingand

Digital distributionhas revolutionized
the way we obtain content and has
greatly reduced the need for piracy

Books hold a special place on and off
the shelf. Whether they’re printed on
toothy stacks of paper and frail pages
orviewed on a touch-screen pad,
these seldom predictable encounters
tend to show up in all aspects of life.

In the exhibit appropriately titled
“Books,” now on display in the Barco
Law Library Gallery, local artist and
photographer Karen Kaighin cap-
tures the sirnplistic beauty of books
in a series of images. The pictures
represent the bookas aphysical entity
that holds not only compilations and
information, but also the stories of
the people who once held it and made
it part of their lives.

Images of books spark nostali response

Taken in homey lighting, some
of the pictures have slanted shadows
that caress the book edges, almost en-
ticing the viewer to pick up the book
and see what mysteries it has to hold.

Associate director of the gallery
Marc Silverman coordinated this
exhibition and began the process of
inviting Kaighin to display her art

more than a year ago.

“In creating exhibits, there are
a lot of little things such as press re-
leases, insurance for the art, et cetera,
and the gallery itselfis usually booked
one to two years in advance,” Silver-
man said about the curating process.

Kaighin is a local artist whose
work and alternative methods of

photography are well—known in the
Pittsburgh area.

“Karen works with alternative
processes in photography,” Silver-
man said.

Most ofher photos are taken using
nontraditional cameras, and Kaighin

emphasized her love of using ﬁlm to

shoot her photos. Describing her pho-
tographic process, Kaighin said that
after she took the initial ﬁlm photos,
she then “scanned the negatives of
the photos and made digital prints
for the ﬁnished products.”

This method seems to be dying
out in today’s modern  realm.
“I like the look of ﬁlm and feel a kind
of nostalgia for it,” Kaighin said. Her
method of photography helps to draw
a different relationship between the
process and the images.

For the Barco exhibit, Kaighin pri-
marily took photos of reader’s ency-
clopedias and a few mystery novels.

FILM REVIEW

‘GoodTime’ brings girl

Kira Scammell
Staﬁ’ Writer

“For a Good Time, Cai|...i’
‘ Directed by: Jamie Travis
Starring: Ari Graynor,
Lauren Miller, Justin Long
(Grade: B+

Two girls come together to start
a fruitful entrepreneurial business.
Only, these girls are in the business
of sex operating. —

Like other [comedies about
women set in New York City, “For
a Good Time, Call...” tells the story
of two post—collegiate roommates,
Katie (Ari Graynor) and Lauren
(Lauren Miller), who struggle to
pay rent each month. The story
is based on Lauren Miller’s real-
life friendship with her college
roommate, Katie Naylon, and the
ﬁlm acts as Miller’s debut as both
a writer and lead actress.

Since it’s premiere at the Sun-
dance Film Festival this pastJanu-
ary, “For a Good Time, Call...” has

s together in unlikely career

 

been anticipated as a raunchy com-
edy similar to movies like “Brides-
maids” and “Bachelorette.”

The beginning of theﬁlm is pre-
dictable. Katie and Lauren have
hated each other for the past 10
years because of a college party
foul. But around the same time
that Lauren gets dumped by her
boring boyfriend, Katie is on the
verge of being evicted from her
spacious apartment that overlooks
Gramercy Park. So Jesse (Justin

sse (center brings Lauren (left) :16 Katie (right togeher as roommates. Courtesy of Focs Features

Long), a mutual friend of the two
girls, sells the place to Lauren by

telling her, “If there was a knot big.

enough in the floor, I would f**k
the s**t out of this place.”

Katie — the token party girl
complete with a stripper pole in
her living room — and Lauren,
better described as a wallﬂower,
clash in their living situation
initially. But a few days after she
moves in, Lauren ﬁnds out that her
new roommate is employed as a

nail technician, a waitress, a ﬂyer
distributor and phone sex opera-
tor. And instead of passing judg-
ment on her new roommate’s many
jobs, Lauren is intrigued.

When Lauren loses her job, she
decides to help Katie expand her
“services” by creating their own
hotline. Lauren acts as the business
manager, while Katie takes care of
the dirty work.

FASHlON WEEK
Fashion Week

to hit runway

Quinn Keaney
Staﬁ Writer

Pittsburgh Fashion Week
Sept. 24 through Sept.
30
www.pittsburghfashion-
week.com

Sartorially inclined Pittsburghers
can rejoice at the arrival of the third-
armual Pittsburgh Fashion Week.

Kicking off on Monday, Sept. 24,
at Soldiers 8: Sailors Memorial Hall
on Pitt’s campus and ending Sept.
30 with a lunch commemorating the
latest group of Pittsburgh Fashion
Hall of Fame inductees, Pittsburgh
Fashion Week will feature a variety
of styles and shows.

The week’s events are both cul-
tural and social, highlighting the
biggest trends in fall fashion to hit
Pittsburghthis year. Local designers,
boutiques, specialty stores, depart-
ment stores and consignment shops
in and around Allegheny Countywill
display their long-awaited garments
and take part in elevat1'ng Pittsburgh’s
fashion proﬁle.

Miyoshi Anderson founded and
created Pittsburgh Fashion Week, and
she currently serves as the executive
director of the week—long soirée, en-
suring that Pittsburgh won’t beleﬁ
out of the American fashion game,
dominated most notably by New
York.

“We aren’t the same caliber as
New York Fashion Week, that’s for
sure, but with new changes in our
city, we’re pushing onward and tak-
ing a nice jog forward in the fashion
industry,” Anderson said.

It started off small and originally
took more than a year to plan, but
Fashion Week has grown since its
debut in 2010. The organizers plan
to utilize different venues throughout
the city and surrounding area this
year, giving them an opporumity to
reach out to various communities
and designers that aren’t necessar-
ily located in the Downtown area.
With events in spaces such as the
Heinz History Center, the Mall at
Robinson, the Omni William Penn
Hotel and even places in Washington
County, this week is truly dedicated
to celebrating the people and style
of Pittsburgh.

“Pittsburgh’s fashion sceneisever—
growing,” Anderson said. “The

Women stake claim in hip hop

Rocks like: Bob Dylan at 30
Grade: A

A quick sample of rap songs leads you
to an obvious conclusion: rappers are cool.
They’re rich, and they ﬂaunt it. They drink
excessive amounts of alcohol and do exces-
sive amounts of drugs. Their sexual prowess
is legendary. '

But the most obvious thing you learn
about rappers? Almost all of the time, they’re
men.

But 2012 has marked itself as a year full
of up—and-coming female rappers, including
a new breed of “white female rapper.” Most
interestingly, these rappers’ largest fan bases
include middle—c1ass girls ﬁt for an episode of
HBO’s “Girls.” But what’s changed? Are these
female rappers singing about empowering
women, or are they simply well-dressed and
pretty enough to win over listeners’ hearts?

Of course, that isn’t to say there aren’t or
haven’t been female rappers in the past. Some
notable examples from the last few decades
include Missy Elliott, Lauryn Hill and Monie
Love. For the most part these women have
faded from the spotlight, leaving rap to be
dominated by masculinity.

The most obvious example of the genre’s
new generation is Azealia Banks. Banks, a
21-year-old Harlem-bred rapper and singer,
became famous last winter with her standout
hit “212.” A wonderfully ﬁlthy mouth and a
wise sampling choice led “212” to become a
popular song for most of the spring, lead-
ing up to the release of her mixtape Fantaxea
injuly. A

People love Banks because she isn’t afraid
to sing about the same topic that male rap-
pers sing about: sex. She’s been crowned a
savior of black gay culture, touring in drag-
ball style. And let’s be honest: Rap and homo-
sexuality aren’t two things that go together
easily.

One girl built similarly in the fabulous
Azealia Banks style is Rye Rye, who incor-
porates indie ideals into her clever feminist
rapping and collaborates with pop stars
like Robyn and M.I.A. Also, Iggy Azalea is a
blonde Australian who became famous after
she released a video for her single, “Pu$$y,”
a bold song about sexual gratiﬁcation for
women. These two womenrap about how
cool they are and how easily they attract
members of the opposite sex, all while look-
ing good without sacriﬁcing their bodies to
the current hip—hop ideal, much as many
would argue Nicki Minaj has.

If you remember, Minaj used to be a well-
respected female rapper, and it’s been agreed

for a long time that her verse in Kanye West’s
“Monster” is the best verse in the song. De-
spite her ridiculous appearance and over-
blown physical form, she was able to rap
with the best of them in 2010 and early 2011.
But Minaj has deteriorated somewhat since,
becoming less of an ideal female rapper and
more of an ideal hip —hop background dancer
who happens to rap. If Minaj is the epitome
of the current hip—hop ideal, then people
like Azalea and Rye Rye are its antithesis.
They already appear more legitimate in their
progressive climb up the indie hip-hop ranks.

However, some new female rappers aren’t
looking for legitimacy in the current indus-
try. Artists like Kreayshawn and star Kitty
Pryde create vaguely clever, vaguely ﬁinny
rap songs. While Kreayshawn seems more
like an internet rap parody (i.e., let’s pick the
whitest girl we know and have her trash talk
over a catchy beat), Kitty Pryde’s allure comes
more from the fact that she looks and sounds
like an adorable 16-year-old girl.

And let’s not forget the incredibly weird
and yet somehow alluring Yo-Landi Vi$$er,
one-half of the South African rap duo Die
Antwoord. With her baby voice spewing dirty
rhymes and singing how —once again — all
the boys want her, Vi$$er appears in control
on the group’s summer 2012 single “Baby’s
On Fire.” Over the course of the song, Vi$$er
shamelessly raps that her sexuality gets her
what she wants. For all of Die Antwoord’s
novelty, Vi$$er’s rapping is unlikely to make
too much of an impact in the hip—hop world,
mostly because it’s difﬁcult to look past Die
Antwoord’s obvious weirdnessand focus on
Visser’s rapping quality.

the rigid lines of pages compressed together.

The images of worn, we1l—used books seem
to parallel the traditional methods in which the
images were taken. Kaighin explained her inspi-
ration behind the exhibition, stating that many
books “just sit on the shel .” But in generations
past, these encyclopedic books were what was
used to conduct research.

Many of the books she photographed were
from her mother, and the photographs exhibit
the wear and tear associated with their use.
The exhibit revels in a topic apart from today’s
online cataloging, which allows us to read texts

on a computer, iPad or other electronic screen.
This exhibit shows the discrepancy between
the past, the present and the future of books.

“There are always going to be people who
cannot afford to buy eBook readers,” said bibli-
ographer and public services librarian Ray Anne
Lockard of the Frick Fine Arts Library. “Those
people need access to information, including
recreational reading, just as much as people
who have electronic devices. There appears to
be a growing divide between the information
haves and have-nots,” she said.

Kaighin’s art shows the necessity of the phys-
ical book and also demonstrates thatabook is in
itselfa work of art, a kind of portable sculpture
that has value and use — spine and all. E

Sea Wolfhas retnumed to its roots for its third
full-length album, Old World Romance.

Less abandthanasolo projectbysinger/song-

a new release thatjs a combination of upbeat,
hopefultunes and mellow, nostalgic ballads — all
of which are aesthetically satisfying and separate
from the band’s past work.

The album’s openingsongandﬁrstsingle“Old
Friend”begins withanostalgic requestthatreﬂects
Church’s overarching desire to return home for
this album, both literally and metaphorically._ “Old
friend, come back home,” Church sings, setting
the tone for the album. ,

After recording Sea Wolf’s sophomore album
far from home as more of a group effort, Church
wantedtodothingshisway——inhisownspace
and onhis owntime——ashe didforSeaWolf’sﬁrst

Church’s vocals and experiments since Sea Wolf’s
inception, butwhile Old World Romanceis clearly
an improvement from its predecessors, it did not
blaze any newtrails inits genre.

The emergence of a few female rappers
probably won’t change the rap game for good,
especially when a decent number of them
aren’t going to be taken seriously by anyone.
But artists like Azealia Banks and Iggy Aza-
lea who are promoting acceptance of female
sexuality and gay culture have begun to create
a new dimension in the hip—hop world.

But the rap world’s presence will remain
intact as long as people keep bragging about
themselves — something both men and wom-
en are capable of. I

ALBUM

Seawolfsometimes sounds like just another mel-
low indie band and may be written off as such by
some listeners. Its sound seems to be aninevitable
product of its environment.

Still, Old World Romance is certainly enjoyable
to listen to and not a loss by any means. In fact,
none of its tracks are failures — a rare achieve-
ment in a genre where most albums contain at
least one songthat listeners won’t revisit.

In his third record, Church seems to have
found an ideal combination between his own
instrumentals and those of his current backing
musicians. Drums, keyboards, bass, guitar and
cello combine in 10 well—executed tracks for an

album that proves Church is a far more versatile
musician — both vocally and instrumentally —-
than his ﬁrsttwo albums may have let on. Church’s
ability to craft catchy hooks has always been evi-
dent, but his previous two Sea Wolfalbums both
had afeeling of redundancy that this album rises
far above. For Sea Wolf, Old World Romance is a
shiftfrom anoverdone, melancholy mold of indie
pop to afresher, morejoyful folk sound.

Sea Wolfis often compared to Arcade Fire,
Bright Eyes and Elliott Smith among others, but
many of the band’s past endeavors have been
criticizedas duller, less edgy projectsthatlack any
exciting new twists or innovations. Their songs
ﬁlled the iTunes libraries of fans who listen to such
artists, butonly capturedthe hearts ofthose new
to the genre. I

Andrew Stern
Staﬁ Writer

Nick Wysong has had quite the
week.

Friday, the freshman turned
19 and scored a hat trick. He then
registered an assist Sunday against
Duquesne, these performances
culminating in his title of Big East
Rookie of the Week.

Wednesday night he continued
his good form, scoring two goals to
help Pitt beat Robert Morris 2-0 and

’~«‘-’ remain undefeated.

/.

.s

“I guess I was in the right spot
at the right time,” Wysong said of
his brace. ‘

Pitt, triumphant in its last four
games, started out extremely poorly
on Wednesday evening, allowing the
Robert Morris Colonials (2-5-1) to
stick around.

But after the break, Pitt started
to show some life. That newfound
energy led the Panthers to score two
goals in front of the home crowd.

The ﬁrst tally came when, after
receiving a pass from freshman Matt
Venanzi, midﬁelder Cory Werth ad-
vanced the ball to freshman Nick
Wysong.

Wysong then rocketed a shot
from about 12 yards out into the
left corner, beating Colonials goalie
Toba Bolaji and giving the Panthers

'8» Last Saturday, the Pitt football

team produced likely the best
game the University’s current
student body has seen during
its time at the school.

A number of great team quali-

j,$j ties emerged from the Panthers

it when they stunned No. 13 Virgin-
ia Tech. The offense moved down
the field at will, churning out long
touchdown drives and control-
ling the tempo of the game. And
defensively, it looked like Steelers

as the unit shut down the Hokies’

SPORTS

W6rsong’s two goals help Pitt continue undefeated season

a 1-0 lead in the 71st minute.

Not long after the ﬁrst goal, the
freshman connection would work
again. Wysong received a beauti-
ful feed from Matt Venanzi and
dribbled his way through the Rob-
ert Morris defense before sending

a blast off his left foot and into the ‘

left part of the net -— his second goal
of the game and ﬁfth of the week.
Pitt head coach Joe Luxbacher
saw marked improvement in the
team during the second period.
“We made some adjustments at

halftime, and the guys decided they
were going to play a bit harder,” Lux-
bacher said. “I don’t want to make
excuses, but we were tired, having
played three games in past six days.
It was a good win, and Nick scored
some great goals, and we played

much better in the second half.”

the Panthers have had a ﬁve—game

performance has earned him a starting role

Thomas three times —-— and pre-
vented Virginia Tech from ever
establishing a running game.

Needless to say, a lot of great
things happened for a Pitt foot-
ball program yearning to reas-

_sert national prominence under
new coach Paul Chryst, who has
already demonstrated a greater
ability to win big games than the
school’s other recent coaches.

But the best development
from Saturday’s game? The 157-
yard performance delivered by
true freshman phenom running
back Rushel Shell.

The rise of Rushel came rather
unexpectedly, even to me. But
now, after stiff-arming, truck-
ing and running his way all over
and through a nationally ranked
Hokie defense, Shell is here to

stay.

Much has been said about his
incredible feats in high school,
playing at Hopewell — where Pitt
legend and Heisman Trophy—win-
ner Tony Dorsett played before
his days at Pitt Stadium — and
his state-record 9,078 rushing
yards.

But it’s time to turn the page

on that.

Because now, Pitt fans could
be watching a new legend in the
making.

With that being said, I found
myself at a loss for words when,
after looking at Pitt’s depth chart
for this Saturday’s game against
Gardner-Webb,.I discovered that
Shell is still the third running
back.

He’s behind Ray Graham, who C

might be playing well in his own
right, but is only 5—foot-9, 190
pounds and still rounding back
into form after his knee injury.
Through three games, Graham
registered 268 yards on 57 at-

. tempts and two touchdowns.

Those numbersare solid, but
they’re not what we expected
coming into the year after “RG1”
—-— as I like to call him —-— led the
nation in rushing prior to los-
ing the rest of his season to the
knee injury. Don’t get me wrong:
Graham is good, but he still isn’t
the star Pitt fans expected and

, hoped to see.

Shell also finds himself behind
sophomore Isaac Bennett and his
17 total carries for 74 yards and
one touchdow so far this yearn.
A little larger than Graham at

5—foot—11 and 205 pounds, Ben-
nett is a viable goal—line back,
as fans saw when he punched

in a touchdown run against S

Youngstown State in the opener.

But I believe that Shell should
not sit behind anyone.

At 6-foot and 215 pounds, he
is just about the same size as NFL
star Adrian Peterson.

But it’s not just about how
big he is, even though Shell is

stronger and larger than most.

last Saturday.

Shell broke through the de-
fensive front seven more often

much-maligned offensive line as
well — andconsistently broke

WORDS OF WILSON

Champions League’s return a good thing for sports fans

Jasper Wilson
Assistant Sports Editor

With the NHL lockout now
official and the NBA not truly
mattering until after Christmas,
sports fans need something to
satisfy their fix in the middle
of the week. Champions League
soccer should fill that void.

The 32-team European pro- I

fessional soccer tournament run
by the Union of European Foot-
ball Associations — the conti-
nent’s governing body for soccer
— is the most competitive and
arguably the most exciting of its
kind in sports.

For casual soccer fans: Imag-
ine the level of skill at the World
Cup, but better. The World Cup
requires countries from all
around the world to participate,»

V meaning nations such as Togo,

Montenegro and New Zealand
get beaten on by traditional‘
powers. The Champions League
has a smaller, but more talented

. pool to draw from since its par-

ticipants are the best teams from
the strongest soccer continent.

A higher level of play results.
The tournament’s group stage

-began on Tuesday, and the final

is on May 25. But what’s great
about this event —— besides the
games themselves — is its for-
mat. '

Because of the time differ-
ence between the U.S. and Eu-
rope, most games happen at
2:45 in the afternoon. This is
the perfect time slot no matter
who, or where, you are. Have
a boring lecture? Watch some
action on your laptop. At work?
Plan your lunch break around
a game. Matches take place on
Tuesdays and Wednesdays, so
the commitment required for
viewing even one game a week
is minimal. No need to find the

fortitude it takes to wake 
early on the weekends to watch-“ 

European league games.

The two—legged structure
used in the group and knockout
stages works well on television
because it’s short enough that

you don’t get bored of a particu- ._,
lar matchup, and you also get to
see which team is truly better ‘

instead of witnessing the arbi-

trary nature of single elimina-
tion knockout.

The games last two hours,
which gives you ﬂexibility with
your schedule, and the fact that
match days occur every two
weeks ensures that the product
won’t become stale in the way
thatgday after day of baseball
does... . . I ’ ‘

Fox, which has held the
American broadcasting rights to
the competition-since 2009 and
will continué ;fQ;do so until 2015,
needs to manage such a precious
jewel with more love and care.
The network’s soccer-specific

channels such as Fox Soccer
‘Channel aren’t on standard

cable, which keeps the general
public from having easy access
to the sport. .

This approach makes sense as

‘ ea: business strategy, but it also

comes off as a blatant abuse of
power. Currently, the regional
Foxisports network, Root Sports

‘ in Pittsburgh, shows only two

games each match cycle. The

ilﬁnall is always on the local fox

affiliate, WPGI-I, and big games

are sometimes there or on FX. ,

Hopefully more games will be
regularly featured on those sta-
tions so the game can continue
to expand its reach here.

The wild finish to the Real
Madrid-Manchester City game
on Tuesday made me realize how
much I missed this competition
these past four months and how
much I wanted to convince peo-
ple who aren’t yet soccer fans of
the competition’s appeal.

Jose Mourinho, the manager
of Real Madrid, has appeared in
three Champions League finals
and won two with other clubs
already, yet he celebrated Cris-
tiano Ronaldo’s game-winning
goal as though he had just won
the lottery.

That level of passion holds
true for players and fans alike.
This is the trophy they all cov-
et. For many of the world’s best
players, it has. a greater cache
than the World Cup because
their native countries aren’t
strong enough to compete seri-
ously, while their clubs are (e.g.,
Ryan Giggs of Wales or Didier
Drogba of the Ivory Coast).

The environment of these

  

W

stadiums mesmerizes and can
serve as a lesson in how true
support of professional teams
should look and sound, in con-
trast to the artificial and manu-
factured noise that permeates
our domestic leagues. I’m look”?
ing at you, NBA.

Also, what other sports com-
petition has its own anthem?

As I’m writing this column,
Oscar, a 21-year-old Brazilian
player, has just scored his second
goal of the game against Italian
powerjuventus in a breathtaking
strike for Chelsea, his new club,
to formally introduce himself
to the soccer-watching world.
Chelsea won the Champions
League back in May, and Oscar’
probablyjoined the Blues be-
cause he, too, wants to win.

The London club’s owner,
Russian businessman Roman
Abramovich, has gone through
seven managers in nine years,
including Mourinho. Despite
winning nine trophies during
that time and becoming the
owner of one of England’s most
