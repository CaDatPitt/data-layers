A proposed revamped registra-
tion system represents the initial
step toward the ability to bill stu-
-dents on a credit hour basis, ac-
cording to Joseph Dutton, Vice
Chancellor of Operations. ‘

of such a system.

The report, compiled by an Op-
erations task force, further rec-
ommended the introduction of an
add-drop fee beyond a certain
date, with a bonus for individuals
preregistering at the
times.

The bonus would consist of a

guaranteed seat for the particu-

lar courses.

Dutton noted that there were
15,000 drop-adds in the winter se-
mester billing, with some stu-
dents even dropping courses for
which they were not registered.

"This completely goofed up our
system and statistics and became
advantageous to the student be-
cause it delayed the invoicing pro-
cedure,” stated Dutton in a pre-
lude to the report.

_ “Kids would come in and drop
“ courses just to screw up the sys-
tem,” he said. “We’ve got a mons-
ter on our hands (referring to the

~ present system).”

 

However, Eugene Richardson,

Processing and chairman of the

“He always uses Japanese com-

According to Plato. there are
various styles of karate.

"Each style has a different

philosophy and stresses one or»

kan style (that used by the Pitt
team) is well-rounded; it is about
50 per cent arms and 50 per‘ cent

The proposal also ‘hopes to gain

According to Richardson, the
registration task force included
no faculty or student members be-
cause “we wanted to concentrate

The task force members includ-
ed the Registrar. Comptroller,
Director of Administration Sys-

In the past, the various offices
involved had shared what Dutton
termed a “Hatfield-McCoy type

"It was the old buck’ passing

Richardson feels that the prob-

“There are three types (of spar-

first is three-attack sparring,
where both ‘sides know ahead of
time what attack will be used and
what the block will be. The second
is one-attack, where only the at-'

there is free sparring, where _nei-
ther the attacks nor the blocks are
pre-arranged. . . . Free sparring
is "used during competition.”

Though a hobby to some, the two
regard karate as more than that.

“Karate makes you face your-
self." said Tomcanin. "It makes

teaches you to endure pain and
keep it to your'self." ‘

"In Japanese. karate‘ means
‘empty hand’."‘ added Plato. "Kar-

The Commuter Association is investigating the possibility of over-

night facilities in the Towers for commuter students.

Margie Masilunas, president of the CA, has proposed that com-

. muters be given a half floor in the women’s dorms and a half floor in

the men's dorms. She feels that two dollars a night would be a rea-
sonable cha rge:

If the CA obtains access to dormitory rooms. an effort will prob-
ably be made to distribute opportunities for lodgings as widely as
possible. , ,.

“An attempt will be made to limit, the numbers of nights per term
that a student can rent a room,” Masilunas said. “We would want the

- facilities to available to the greatestnumber of students.”
Masilunas is optimistic about this new proposal and about the

CA5 plans for dances, picnics, coffee houses. etc.

1 Her optimism is due in part to the cooperation which the CA has re-
‘ceived f'rom the Student Government. specifically. Tom Bailey. Student
Government Board president.

“Tom Bailey seems to be really sensitive toward commuters and

the problems we face,” Masilunas commented. “It looks like we will _

be able to work well with him.” /
_The CA has been active on other fronts as well. The associations

C car pool chairman, Bob Heister. has just completed car pool lists of

‘ Pitt and Carnegie—Mellon commuters which will be distributed this

week. Though this merger of sorts has never been tried before. Masil-
unas believes it will be easy for Pitt and C-MU students to help each
other out because of the proximity of the two schools.

Parking, perennial commuter problem. received a boost earlier
this year when the administration built a new commuter parking lot
located beside Trees Hall. The CA played a major role in convincing
the administration the lot was needed. ‘

A comprehensive health insur-
ance plan. including such benefits
as University Health Service.

be available to Pitt students next
September.

The Blue Cross-Blue Shield
Health package was approved by
the Advisory Board to Student
Health Services Wednesday. pend-
ing modifications to be made pior
to signing the contractglt will re-
place the current program con-
tracted to Strothman and Mock
which expires Aug. 28.

The plan is optional. available
at the annual cost of $56 per stu-
dent. Married students can obtain
coverage for their entire fami-
lies at $153.60. In addition to these
benefits previously listed. the
plan includes hospitalization and

tions. x-rays. and laboratory serv-
ices. .

‘Students not enrolling in the in-
surance plan will receive medical
services on a fee-system basis.
Director of the Health Service Dr.
Joseph Hinchliffe said students
will be charged the amount it
costs the Health Service.

For instance, Hinchliffe said a
gynecological visit will cost ap-
proximately $10, a visit ‘with a
general practitioner around $7.
The University will continue to

' subsidize all nursing care. health

education. and preventive medi-
cine. '

Although state laws require dor-
mitory students to be insured.
they will not be required to pur-
chase the University insurance
if they» can prove they are cov-

The movement toward a com-

began when a huge increase in
Health Service usage indicated
that the University budget could
not meet rising student health de-
mands.

Administrators advised Hinch-

  Price defines horror, villainyﬁg

U‘

U

by SUE HOENSTINE

If you attended a lecture by a
master villian you might expect
a greasy—haired. black-caped fel-
low to slither around the audience
dropping lizard s into the laps of
old women. A

This. however. was not the case
when actor Vincent Price reveal-
ed his admiration for villians be-
fore a Duquesne University audi-
ence Wednesday.

The gray-haired. gray suited
gentleman looked more like an
Oxford professor or someone
you'd meet for tea and crumpets
in a London club than the star of
The Fly or The Pit and the Pendu-
lum.

Only when Price wrung his
hands over the podium and let his
stacotteed English accent fade
into a sinister laugh could one
make a connection between the
lecturer and Price’s ominous film
roles. .

Price termed villain y a "sub-
tle art" and explained the traits
of a true villian.

"Villains represent the major
element of chanc-‘re and the con-
flict of good and evil." he said.

“Asa villain I have to take the
despicable and make it delec-
table,” Price snickered. “Villains
must walk a tightrope between
horror and hysteria. You (the au-
dience) provide the hysteria and
we provide the horror.”

But to Price murder, blood and
gore are not the only elements of
true horror.

Straw Dogs, Price explained.
“is not a horror movie. It only
presents the violent side of hu-
man‘ nature. And Dracula is a
phony character because he can‘t
do anything without drawing

A Iblood." ,

 

Price depicted villains as men
with human characteristics with

. whom an audience can identify.

"Life makes people into vil-

lains,“ he said. "The best villians

are people who are knocked off
the straight and narrow "and get
into trouble. We are fascinated by
these people. because we know

VINCENT PRICE: Making the despicable delectable.

that it can happen to us. "

“Iago. the villain in Shakes-
peare‘s Othello is the part every
one wants to play." Price said.
"What makes him (Iago) the vil-
lain is Othello. Iago cant stand
Othello because.Othello‘s so damn
good and it eventually drives Iago
to his villain."

Price admitted the the hardest
job he ever had “was keeping a
straight face in The Fly. «

“Everytime I‘d look at Herbert
Marshall (who played a charac-
ter who transformed to a giant
fly)’ and see him caught in that

ridiculous cobweb I'd go mad with g '

laughter.

"him co-signing Percy’s expendi-
tures, asked to hold a referendum
on the $1,200 per year salary he
receives as chairman of the
Gen e ral Studies Student Cabinet.

"‘I don’t think I've asked any-
thing that's unreasonable,” said
Moye of his request. “1 clearly
stated to him that it is necessary
to have a clearly defensible poli-
cy for paying salaries out of stu-
dent activities fees.” »

Percy, however. bridled at what
he considered hnauthorized ad-
ministrative control. He agreed

_ to hold the referendum but gather-

ed about a half-dozen present and
former student "leaders. all of
whom had grievances with Moye
or Student Affairs in general.

The result was last weeks abor-
tive anti-Moye movement. spear-
headed by Percy. _supported by

 former Commissioner WadeLaw-

son, and quashed by the Chancel-
lor’s enthusiastic support of Moye.

_ , "FORCEFUL STYLE
Whatever procedural -feud exist-
ed was probably compounded by
Percy's, forceful" style. At a re-

cent’ meeting with Moye. Percy

reportedly stated in no uncertain
terms that he was after Moye's
job, leading to.a heated exchange
of epithets between Percy and

Moye's staff. Though not person-
ally abrasive. Percy has pushed
hard to win what he c0nside1's a
rightful slice of University serv-
ices for General Studies students.

When he took over the leader-
ship of the Cabinet last summer,

it was afledgling uninfluential or-»

ganization that had spent but $3,-
500 the previous year.

Perc_v‘s own election was symp-
tomatic of the organization's
weakness. Though. according to
the Cabinet constitution about 25
people were eligible to vote, only
‘a handful did. Which didn‘t much
matter. since- Percy was unop-
posed.

‘Quietly but determinedly. Per-
cy strengthened the group. He
first spent over $5.000 furnishing
the Cabinet office in room 360 CL.
Then he went about trying to in-
tegrate General Studies students
into the campus mainstream.

Percy once complained that “the
General Studies student is, to a
large extent, a forgotten man on
campus.” If so, he wasn’t forgot-
ten long. -

During the Fall Term. Percy

helped initiate a fistful of pro—;

grams for General'Studies stu-
dents, including an intramural
program, half-priced ‘tickets to

offended by the attempt which Mr.

Money was no object. The Luv‘

Inn contract, for example. cost stu-

dents $6.000. Percy. however. had

an ample xwar chest—$80.000 in

student activities fees—to draw
from.

For his pains, Percy received
a $1,200 salary, also from student
activities fees. Over and above
this amount, Percy was paid more
than $1,700 in personal expenses
between July 1 and December 31.

According to Percy. some of
this money bought beer for a par-
ty and security for a concert. But
he admitted that a_good deal of
the‘ funds financed such items as
gas and mileage money for Cabi-
net members to commute to and

eral Studies students. _.

Some administrators, however,
noting Percy’s rather shaky man-

A week prior to the “dump-
Moye" meeting. the students

. mentioned in the article were con-

tacted by Gordon Percy and met
in the General Studies Student
Government Office to discuss

problems which we were. having

with Student Affairs. It was men-
tioned atthis time that some stu- _
dents were after Dr. Moye’s job,
however, the majority of the stu-
dents present felt that Dr.‘ Moye"
had given us no reason to ask for
his job. but agreed that we would
meet with the Chancellor and dis-
cuss the problems with Student
Affairs. -
About a week later these same
students, and to my knowledge an
uninvited reporter from the Pitt
News, met with the Chancellor to
discuss student affairs. Before
any discussion was taken, how-
ever, Mr. Pattak was asked to
leave the meeting and after a

‘quite futile argument, and a vote

by the students present, he de-
parted. I -

I feel this background is essen-

' tial to‘ understand the sour grapes

attitude which Mr. Pattak showed
in his article. " -

There are several basic mis— ’

truths in the article which I would
like to point out:

First, in his opening paragraph

is ‘Mr. Pattak states thata group of

student leaders met to dump
Moye. This is untrue. There were
at the most, three students pre-
sent who even considered asking"
for Moye’s job, and this was ‘not
brought up at the -meeting.

(Editor's Note: Nowhere in the
article does Pattak call the meet
ing \a- “dump-Moye” movement.

The phraseology is Ging’s. Pattak

also notes‘ that anti-Moye senti-

.'ment was not a major topic of‘-‘,_
-. I . th'e.megting‘.)_ 1 A '

.uPercy’s anti-apathy efforts shake up administrators

"paper. the Nite Times, tailored

They cite an incident of the Fall
Term. when Percy allegedly tried
to have fired a University tele-
communications worker who had
displeased him. Percy claimed
that he was merely concerned
about the capabilities of the work-
er. but some continue to view it
as petty head-hunting echoedin
the anti-Moye movement. '

, ADMINISTRATION MORE
CONCERNED THAN STUDENTS

Pointing to the increase in Cab- A

inet members from three to'5O or
60. Percy claims that his free-
wheeling policies have had a tonic
effect on student apathy; -

“When the Nite Times first
came out,” he said, “I had 20 or
30 students stop me and say, ‘Hey,
I’m glad somebody_’s taking care

99! '

of us. /

"Students down at the Lu_v Inn
jump all over me when I go there
saying. ‘Hey. this is great!”

Yet for the mostpart. the ad-
ministration has been more con-
cerned with Percy’s policies than
students have been. ' . -

I asked 20 General Studies
students studying in the Commons
Room Tuesday evening to eval-
uate Gordon Percy’s term. One
praised him effusively, one prais-

ed him cautiously, and 18 smiled

politely and shrugged.
They -had never heard of him.

Second, Mr. Pattak lists me as
one of the students who _was ask-
ing for Moye’s job, and I go on
record as calling Mr. Pattak a
damned liar.

(Editor's Note: Pattak merely

--lists Ging as attending the meeting.
He also stated that ‘n‘the drive"
brought together students disaf--
fecte'd with both Moye and Stu-A 

dent Affairs in general.”)

A Third. of the -seven students pre- «

sent at the meeting. only two were
quoted.in the article, so I ques-

tion how Mr. Pattak was able“ to’
ascertain

the motives of the

others who were in attendance.

 

~ (E nor 5 Note: Pattak interview-y

. ed and quoted four of the students

present and made repeated un-
successful. efforts to contact Ging.)

Finally, every" administrator
who was quoted in the article was-
quoted anonymously, which sug-
gests to me that Pattak either
possesses the Clifford Irving li-
cense to contrive information or
that Pattak was afraid to quote
these men.

(Editor's Note: Both the Chancel-
Ior and Dr. Moye were quoted by
name. Two other administrators
quoted requested that their quotes
not be attributed to them.)

I suggest that students be aware
that Clifford Irving is not the only

person in this country who feels
no qualms about distorting infor— ‘

mation for his own ends, and hope
that before believing this type of
diatribe they‘sea_rch a little deep-_
er for the truth. «

Students, viewing the paradox
of simultaneous peace and con-
flict, will havethe opportunity to
examine the issue in the under-
graduate "Conflict and Peace
Studies Program” opening in the

fall semester.

"The program will focus on the
circumstances which cause large
scale conflicts on the interna-
tional, nation, and local levels,"
Dr. Jerome Laulicht, associate

professor of "sociology and direc-

tor of the program, said.

But establishing causes will not
be the ultimate concern of its par-
ticipants, Laulicht emphasized,
since the reduction and preven-
tion of conflict and violence will
receive equal consideration.

In order to do this, the program
will draw from various disci-
plines, including the humanities,
social and natural. science depart-
ments, and the schools of. law, in-
formational sciences, and public
and international affairs.

The initial program will consist
of: _

-—four’ interdisciplinary core
courses including: Problems of
War and _Peace,, Problems of
Social Justice and Human Sur-
vival, the Analysis of Conflict,
and Approaches to Conflict Res-
olution: Theory and Practice.
(The first two courses are to be

included" in the Freshman"

Studies Curriculum, but open
other students also.) ' ' —

—selected courses offered under

‘ departmentalauspices. g

A certificate will be awared to

gram is not limited to those wish-
ing to complete certification re-
quirements.

ticipants concluded that the is‘-
sues of peace and conflict had so
many facets that the traditional

singular approach could not ade- .

quately examine the subject. In-
stead, they. proposed the basic
structure upon which the new pro-
gram is based. '

.Although not under the same
title, many other colleges and uni-
versities have established or are

— developing programs similar to

Pitt’s, including Kent State Uni-
Yersity, ‘University of Wisconsin,
Princeton University in New Jer-
sey and the University of Penn

’ sylvania. .

The impetus for such programs, _
said Laulicht, has not come from
students concerned with ‘racial,
social, or international conflicts.
Instead, Laulicht credits aca-
demes» for the increasing inter-
est in the subject.

The designers of a course on America's prison system have won _‘

$2.500 in the Experimental Course of the Year contest.

Called “The” Correctional'System in a Free Society,” -the course?‘
was devised by Sociology Professor John Karns, Director of -Special‘:

ulty, chose theiwinner from more than 40 entries. *

“It seemed to me that this course among other things indicated

the most careful planning,”‘he said.

“As a course involving outside lecturersland teamwork,” added
Schneewind, “this seemed more carefully integrated.” '

Thecourse will introduce students to the theory, structure, and

function of America's prison system and will, according to its plan-;« 
goal‘of re-:! __‘-A372

Various aspects of the correctional system, including prison lifei,':,:*:::?;.:»1

The course will tap experts from government, penology, ‘and thej‘ 
community, as well as offer students opportunities for field work.

Avrakotos said that the idea for the course stemmed from a sym-’ 
posium last term on the prison system which he helped organize.

of the Communist Party, U.S.A.,

wrong but a “crime” which re-

v quires punishment.

At a Wednesday press confer-

gUnited States, argued that the

If elected President, Hall said,
he would “indict and convict all

Later, Hall told this reporter
that he will’ urge the North Viet-
namese government to persevere,‘
when he visits Hanoi next month.
In Hall's estimation, the Vietna-
mese Communists are on the
verge of victory and should not
give up the struggle.

Hall added that he feared the
Chinese government might put
pressure on the North Vietnamese
to reach a modus vivendi with
the United States in Vietnam.

To bolster that contention, Hall
argued that an “imperialist” like

President Nixon makes conces-
sions (e.g. Nixon‘-s pledge to the
Chinese that he will remove
troops from Taiwan once Asian

tensions ease) only when he has =

something to gain from it.
Hall's suspicion is that Nixon
and Premier Chou En lai of Chi-
na came to an “understanding”
by which the United States will
withdraw its troops from Taiwan‘
if the Chinese convince the Viet-
namese Communists to stop the
fighting in Vietnam.
Otherwise. Hall considers the
U.S. - Chinese rapprochement
healthy.

, VIOLENCE VS.
NON-VIOLENCE

In fact, though Hall may one
day advocate a violent Commun-
ist revolution, for the United
States, he currently favors both
domestic reforms and the reduc-
tion of world tensions.

"Our party has always said
that we will move towards social-
ism in the most peaceful manner
possible." Hall declared. “But."

path,” Hall said, “but we will not
shy away from violence if it is
necessary.”

To promote socialism through
peaceful means. Hall has embark-
ed on a presidential campaign.

A realist of sorts. he recognizes
that he is darker than a dark horse
this year.

“We have no illusions about
what will happen in the present
election,” he noted, “but there
will come a day when Communists
will be elected to office in this
country, and that includes the
Presidency.”

Hall said that ‘jelectoral strug-
gles have always been a feature of
our party.“ -

In line with this. he believes
the 1970 election of Marxist Sal-

they will not back a Communist
revolution. He also argued that
the success’ of the Communist
Party in advocating reforms in-
stills confidence in the power of
the party.

Thus, Hall explained why Com-
munists have played such a ma-
jor role in labor movements in
America. Many scholars believe
the success of American unions
partially explains Communism’s
failure in the United States.

Asked when he will no longer
favor socialism through peaceful
means. Hall said violent revolu-
tion will become necessary when
.the government of the United

.States_stops heeding the majority

of people.

Hall also argued that socialism
takes root in a nation only when
a majority of the people support

it.

“You can’t establish socialism

by a putsch,”- he claimed. “The”

majority of people have to be be-
hind it.”

Hall. one of the founders of the
United Steelworkers Union, work-
ed as a Steelworker and served as
a union staff representative in
Ohio. ’

He is seeking 36.000 signatures
on nominating petitions to place
the Communist Party on the Pres-
idential ballot . this , year. Twenty-

ready been collected.

Krenicky calls Tower
TV room "sure thing

The proposed Towers‘ TV
Lounge is now "a sure thing.“ ac-
cording to Men‘s Dorm Council
President Ken Krenicky.

Krenicky, who has been work-
ing for the lounge since fall term.
said that the Student Government
Allocations Committee last week

‘agreed to provide funds for the

lounge‘s color television.

Krenicky, also a Student Gov-
ernment Board member, believes
that Housing will fin.ance
the drapes, furniture, carpet, and
partitions.

The lounge, which would be lo-
cated in the lobby of Tower A,
could be finished by the end of
this term, "said Krenickv.

The question, Krenicky said. is
not whether there will be a lounge.
but how long it will last once com-
pleted.

“With the way things are rip-
ped-off around here," he said.
"the TV and furniture could dis-
appear within the first month!"

eral security measures including

Hellraising‘Purlie’lots of fun Bland ‘Vanilla’ needs spicing

by LOIS LEVENSON ,
Beginning and ending with a rousing
funeral. Purlie may not invoke heaven.
but it certainly raises hell. And no one
could be blamed for selling his soul to the
devil in order to enjoy this happy musical.

For a change blacks have the choice
roles and handle them with such aplomb
that you are swept up in their rejoicing and
laid low by their solemn spirituals.

Reverend Purlie Victorious is a self-
styled black liberator who had been plan-
ning for 20 years to buy a country church
on the south Georgia plantation where he
lived.

There he’d be able to preach the real
meaning of freedom which he believes is
more than ‘just six feet of land in which
you are buried alive by poverty.

To achieve this goal, he brings a sim-
ple country girl, Lutibelle (a name he con-
siders a "disgrace to the Negro profes-
sion”), to impersonate a dead cousin who
has been left an inheritance of $500.

The money is being kept by 01’ Capn’, a
Simon Legree relic who owns the land
they lived on, the cotton they picked for
him and the commissary where he sells
them rotten food at prices that put all the
blacks into the kind of debt that kept slav-
ery alive and well long after Abe Lincoln
died for our sins.

Purlie conspires hilariously with his

brother. Gitlow; his sister-in-law, Missy..

and the Capn‘s guitarplaying,peace song-

~‘ writer son to get the money and thereby

obtain dignity.
All ends well for the plotters, but the

credibility is unpleasantly strained at the
ridiculously contrived ending.

No matter. The suberb cast polishes the

- cardboard lines as if they were fine mar-

ble and the surface shines.

The Nixon's musical fare usually of-
fers two or three good voices per show.
only one of which can be heard beyond the

/tenth row. Purlie offers the gift of songs

that can all be heard and are all worth

Robert Guillaume as Rev. Purlie makes
the audience his following from the start.
His wide gesturing. smooth strut, and sly
grin belie his severe incantations.

His tonal quality is consistently lively
whether he’s talking love to Lutibelle,
preaching “power” to his people, or lam-
enting his plight, showing the underlying
stamina that makes this man a leader.

Never missing a chance to punctuate
her lines with facial expressions, Patti Jo's
Lutibelle has the audience
roaring at every lift of hereye-
brows and protrusion of her
lower lip. Varying between
wide-eyed shyness and loud-

and growls with laugh-evok-
ing results.

The uniting force is carried with moth-

_ erly love throughout the play by Carol Jean

Lewis as Missy. Whether consoling Purlie,
advising Lutibelle, or taking a bat to the
side of her husband’s head, she is a lovable

and loving comic with a soothing singing -

voice.

Gary Gelds and Peter Udell’s songs are
great for swooning and shouting, starting
from the opening curtain with the exciting
“Walk Him Up the Stairs.” .

Coupled with Louis Johnsonfs clever
choreography, songs like, “Skinn1n’ a Cat"
and “Great White Father" (with the field

hands dressed like ragged Whiffenpoofs)
I produce ripples of laughter throughout. '

“Being colored can be lots of fun—if
there ain’t nobody lookin”’ is a sentiment
expressed by one of Purlie’s,characters.
Not to get a look at this show, whether
you’re black or white, would be to miss’ a

Feature Editor

The Latent Image flashes clips of be-
lated relevance across the Shadyside
screen with its second full length feature.
No, it’s not Return of the Night of the Liv-
ing Dead, but There’s Always Vanilla, a
remarkable unobtrusive creation certain

to emerge as one of 1972’s genuinely me- .

diocre efforts.

For while Night of the Living Dead (a
Latent Image product) was either lauded
as a classic or at least vehemently de-
nounced. There’s Always Vanilla fails
. even to offend. The script lacks

punch. and the credibility of=
the listless plot is marred by

cares?”

Afterall, it’s the eminently

forgetable, oft-rendered tale

of a wanderin’ ex-"session ma‘ (Ray Laine) .

in search of (no kidding) “experience.”

Didn’t such quasi-relevance cease to be

fashionable about two years ago? Anyway,

this guy Chris is simultaneouly striving

to relate to his "I-can-still-cut-the-mus-
tard” father (Roger McGovern).

Rather than unravel the ensuing. not-
so-elusive strands of the plot, suffice it to
say that a love affair with a fluke acquain-
tance (Judith Steiner) culminates in an
aborted abortion and a further unclimactic
climax.

Is that all there is? Just about. The
artificial depth lent by George Romero’s
direction should" mislead only the most
cursory viewer, although as a typical dou-
ble-bill-B-movie-supporting.attraction, the
picture stacks up as almost adequate. '

Neither tasty. nor tasteless, the film
lacks ‘a definitive flavor of its own. Since
the film was made here, Pittsburgh thea-
ter-goers may amuse themselves straining

‘ to perceive familiar-ities in the background

b‘ut elsewhere even this advantage should
vanish. Thus the unfortunate construction
will be evaluated on its own rather ‘dubious
merits, as the skyline melts into unobtru-
siveness. »

Perhaps the most strikingly insipid
trait is none‘other than the title. Brace
yourself: Chris’ dad is describing the mer-
its of selecting. the relatively accessible in
life, noting that though Howard Johnson’s
boasts a slew of flavors. intermittenly per-
iods of unavailability (and hence, disap-
pointment) occur.

But. he stresses. "There's always va-
nilla."

Chris merely ponders the poor fellow‘
who’s hung up on butter pecan.

Lion 'B’ team whips

outclassed gymmen

by RICK_ROSENTHAL

The Pitt gymnasts took some of
the battles, but Penn State easily
won-the war Wednesday night at.
Trees Hall. 135.00-101.95.

Pitt took the floor exercise
event.,22.00-21.90 with three fine
performances turned in by Mark
Boyett. Ed Swerdlow, and Dick
Pribis. ‘

Boyett led off for the Pitt gym-
men and performed a clean rou-
tine which rated a 6.9 from the
judges. “Boyetthinjured his ankle

in pre-meet warm-ups, but after I

having his ankle taped, performed"
quite well," said Coach Warren

‘Neiger. g
Ed Swerdlow turned in what he .

thought was ‘his best routine‘of

. the year but the judges disagreed.

Swerdlow said, “I increased the
difficulty of my routine. perform-
ed it better than before. but I
scored lower with the- same

. judges as last time."

Pribis took first in the event,

- scoring 7.7, on a fine performance g

markedby a full twister and a su-
perior-difficult hand-press.

’ Assistant Coach Ig Perez said,
“It was Dick’s smoothness in per-
forming his routine which enabled
him to take first in the event.”

Grid highlights
shown next week

The first public showing of the
entire Pitt football highlights film
will be next Tuesday night in 120,
David Lawrence Hall. The half-
hour film will start at both 8 p.m.
and 9 p.m. and everyone is wel-
come to attend.

Produced by the Pitt Publicity
Department. the movie is entitled
"A Year to Grow." A short seg-

J ment of it was shown on WTAE- .

TV during the halftime of the Pitt-
Penn State basketball game last
week. , '
After the initial showing, the

No coachgin the country has more right to say
that his team has had the bad breaks this year. than
West Virginia‘s Sonny Moran. ‘

After seeing his high scoring Mountaineers get
off to a flying start with five straight wins. Moran
has endured a series of misfortunes that caused him
toreorganize his club.

Two starters were declared ineligible (Larry

v Harris and Levi Phillips) and two weeks later. Har-

ris perished in an auto accident. In the same mis-

hap, starting forward‘ Sam Ogelsby was seriously
injured. .

_ One week later, reserve forward Bob Hornstein

suffered a collapsed lung, and following that, re-

serve center Gary Reichenbecher was also injured.

Despite all this. the Mountaineers have proven
tough on their home floor in the beautiful WVU Coli-
seum, and Panther Coach Buzz Ridl anticipates a
"struggle" in tomorrow nights 8 _p.m. season finale
for P-itt and WVU. ) ‘ -- .

"Don‘t feel to sorry for them." Ridl warned.

Recently, the Mounties were nipped by Penn
State, 80-79, in the final two seconds, and succumb-
ed to Virginia, 89-88, in overtime. Last Saturday,
Wil Robinson sank a 12 foot jumper at the final buz-g
zer to give WVU a 78-77 win over Manhattan in the
ECAC game of the week. Wednesday

Virginia Tech, 83-82.

Robinson. who recently moved into third_posi-
tion on the all—time WVU sfcoring list behind Jerry
West and Rod Hundley. is the fifth leading scorer

in the nation with a 28.1 average.

Since the loss of the other starters, the Moun-
taineers rely on Robinson’s prolific scoring ability.
Against Manhattan, Robinson hit for 48 points as
the Mountaineers screenedgand ‘picked for him.

Mike Heitz, the Mountaineers ambling seven
footer, has also picked up the slack by averaging
over 13 points per game. Heitz, a horrid foul shoot-
er (40-96) earns most of his-points underneath with

his height advantage.

Rounding out the starting five for Moran's
squad is guard Curt*Price. a good ball-handler and

But the Wildcats‘ days may be

the I_C4A‘s get underway at 3 p.m.

"Pennsylvania is favored."
commented the Pitt coach. "No.
I‘d say Villanova and Penn are
co-favored. They are both well-

depth." ' _ '

Pitt will enter the new, ultra-
modern Jadwin Gymnasium, “a
dark horse threat,” along with
Adelphi and Manhattan. The Pan-
ther tracksters tied Penn last
year (21 points) behind Villano-
va’s strong 42 point showing.

”’Adelphi’s top‘ entrants in the

Presently, it holds the world re-

If the tracksters’ showing at

This Sunday night the Pittsburgh Knights will battle the College

All-Star Coach Phil Gefsky did
add defenceman Glenn Hyde to
give the blue line crew some

minder Jeff Hart to bolster the

But Williams’ play speaks for
itself at least statistically. So far
this season Williams has scored
ten goals, three of those coming
while'Pitt was shorthanded. The
line of Williams. Glanville and
Browne has accounted for over
half of the goals scored by the en-
tire Pitt team. ’

Even though Williams was not
chosen as an All-Star, the lanky
winger will certainly take some
satisfaction at the end of the reg-
ular season. Pitt has clinched
first place in the City Division and
now is waiting to see_wh0 will fin-

Both C-MU and Duquesne can ~

grab the final playoff spot in the

_dent that the icers will have no

was, for the most part. the do-

stopped 46 shots.

‘ "If we meet Duquesne again. it
will be a good game." Williams
commented. "but I don't think

it that he (the Dukesgoalie) can be
that lucky twice."

As far as the toughest league
competition Pitt has faced, Wil-

liams remarked, “It would be a,

toss-up between Duquesne and
Carnegie-Mell0n.” Last Sunday
Pitt downed C-MU by a 6-1 score.

Eastern gym tourney

“The Pink Panthers." as the women gymnasts at Pitt call them-
selves. acquired varsity status just two short years ago. Starting then
at the "Pussycat" level. the squad has developed to a point of near
"real Cat" status and that is evident by looking at members such as

Donna DeMarino. team captain
this year.

Donna.’ a sophomore physical
education major, hails from Mo-
nessen High School. a school
whose gymnastics team captured
the State Championship for six
consecutive years. For four years.
Donna was on Monessens gym-
nastics team and in her senior
year became team captain.

When asked. “When did it all
start?“ Donna thinks back. “Well.
I messed around withgymnastics
when I was about nine. but I got
more serious myfreshman year
in high school."

Quickly she adds, “My uncle,
Bud Giannini, has" coached me
since I started and I used to work
out at the Monessen Sokol Gym-

nastics Club under his direction \
‘ He’s a great coach and has been

mostly responsible for my devel-
opment as a gymnast. b

"I still have a lot of work to do
before I go to the Easterns. My
best apparatus will probably be
the balance beam."

lllllllllllllll|lllIllllll|llllL3

by STEVE WILLIAMS

It is an obvious fact there exists a great deal
of student dissatisfaction with the sports program
here at Pitt. This discontent seems well warranted
in view of the records of the individual teams. But
there is one team which seems to be well on the
roadback to respectability. the swim team.

With the resignation of the previous coach
whose best year yielded only three victories, new
head Coach Richard Bradshaw has already surpass-
ed that markwith a 4-6 record. , '

This might not seem to be much of an improve-

ment upon initial inspection, but. with a little luck _

and a little fortune. the team could have been
7-3. Besides the improvement in
the team’s record the most not-
able improvement has come from

the participants themselves.

Last year only five members
of the swim team qualified for the
Eastern championships. This
' year nine have qualified in eight
WILLIAMS individual events’ and four relays.
Among this group are three freshmen whom Brad-
shaw recruited, Bernie Victor, Ed Cahill, and Tom
Smith.

But the stalwarts of the team. the core of five
seniors. co-captains Fred Lewis and RickRowe. and
Tom Hayes. Dave Anderson. and Mark Cohen. have
posted times this year at least comparable to or
better than last year.

    

Lewis has bettered the team record by tensec-
onds in the 1.000 freestyle. -while Rowe has come
perilously close to breaking the record in the 200
yard freestyle. Hayes /was swimming better than
ever before. and Anderson was improving his times
until his back injury, and Cohen was swimming fas-
ter than he ever did in his life.

All this indicates that it’s the coach and his‘

style which is responsible for the improvement.

Smile of success

In the swimming world. when the names of In-
diana. Harvard. or Penn swim teams are mention-
ed. a name synonomously runs right along with the
school. the name of its coach : Councilman. Gam-
brell. and Breen. respectively. These men have
brought their schools to where they are now.

And. as in all sports where individuals compete
one-on-one. there are the high strung dispositions of
the competitors which the coach must handle in or-

der to form a good team. Bradshaw has been able '

to handle the cry-babies. the individuals with all
those little aches. and the hotdogs to the point that
they are a team.

Along with his energetic personality and the
ever present sincere smile, he has brought the best
group of graduate divers here to coach his diving
team. Dick Rydze, the NCAA and AAU national
champion; Jon Hahnfeltd, one of the most highly
talented divers to ever come out of Indiana Univer-
sity, and Pitt’s own Dave Wessel have constituted
the corp of highly qualified coaches.

But a coach can’t live off the laurels of the past.
He has to rise to the occasion every year.'For the
‘72-73 season,Bradshaw ‘has already recruited 12

swimmers. And from the 29 which the team has re--

cruited. by alumni. parents. and the swimmers
themselves, nine more possible swimmers from
area high schools have already made verbal com-

mitments to come to Pitt. These 21 freshmen-to-be '

and the 14 sophomores-to-be. already on the team
will be able to fill the trunks of the graduating sen-
iors. ‘

"Were two years from having an outstanding
team,” commented Bradshaw. "We will be filling
the holes left by the seniors this year. but we’ll pos-
sibly be undefeated or have a 9-1 record in two
years. Now that Kent State can't wave out-of-state
tuition. they won't have any edge in recruiting for a
while.

With the return of Mark Wallace and the 26
freshmengand sophomores. the future couldn't be
brighter for Pitt’s swim team.

Variation on

a Theme for

College Students

Many of you (at, least we hope many) by now. have
heard or have heard about the great stereo system
that we designed last fall. Its cost was $429.00,

and it leveled any competition below $600.00, be- a

cause we carefully engineered this system around
the superior smaller Advent loudspeaker. We were
so proud of it that we went for a full page ad in
Time magazine, bragging just a bit. The public,
including hard-nosed college students, loved it,
and purchased over 200 of these systems. —

A few of the extra fussy students (there are always
a couple in every crowd), have made comments
like these:

“Yes, we can easily tellthat the Opus One
stereo system goes much lower in the bass
(where we can feel the notes), and much high-
er_ in the highs than more expensive competi-
tive systems.” ~ '

“Sure, we can. hear that this system is much
clearer and more natural than competitive
units.”

“BUT, we would like to have this clearer, wid-
er range sound LOUDER!"

“We want the deep bass note on Emerson,

"Lake, and Palmer's “Tank” toremain a true
bass note just" like you have been giving us,
but we want it to BEND THE WALLS.”

“What can you, the experts, give us for a little ’ A
‘ bit more money that will be iust, as good, but ,

also louder."

FOR moss EXTRA FUSSY FEW we
DEDICATE THE FOLLOWING VARIATION.

UTILITY ADVENT LOUDSPEAKERS.

This unit sounds just like the smaller Advent, ex-
cept it is immediately louder, and can be played
to even louder limits than the smaller Advent.

The Kenwood
  K5606-P Compact

This flexible unit has (you've guessed it) more
wattage than our $429 system, so that with its RMS
power of 50 watts, it can play the larger Advents

louder. It's loaded with meaningful controls, whose‘

operation can be explained tq you by any of our

staff. The 606 has a sensitive FM stereo and AM" I

tuner. Built into the top isopus one's best loved

automatic turntable, the PE 2034' (alias the PE’

2038). This is the same turntable that we recom-
mend for our $3000 stereo systems, because cg its
full moving tone arm and its quiet dependable op-.
eration. The Kenwood 606 normally comes with a
good Pickering cartridge. However, we feel that
it is not good enough for the Advent speakers, so
we replaced it with a superior Shure 75-6 magnetic
cartridge at no extra cost. - *

The Cost of the System ls..‘l

$509.00

Visit either opus one store to hear it with your
own records. Then check the competition up to
$800 with the same records. You'll be shocked to
hear the superiority of our, system. But then we
did work overtime in creating it.
