The Pitt News

Another Pitt student became the
victim of oncoming traffic along
accident-plagued Fifth Avenue.

Yesterday morning, Rowina V.
Cube, a student from Somerset, Pa.,
stepped into the bus lane in front of
the William Pitt Union and was hit
by the front right side of a PAT bus
using the lane, according to a Pitts-
burgh.Police report. '

“I saw her standing there talking
to a friend when the bus went by. I
heard a noise, then I sawher lying
“there,” said Adam Plotkin, a witness
at the scene. “It happened so fast,
and the bus. driver never even
honked or anything,” he said.

The victim was rushed to Presby-
terian University Hospital where she
‘is listed in serious condition. Hospi-
tal officials will not disclose the

- extent of the injuries until the vic-

tim's family is notified.

The bus driver, identified as eight-
year veteran Theresa Gorman, said
that she tried to avoid the girl. Gor-
man, visibly upset, would not com-
ment any further.

PAT officials will investigate the

cause of the accident although they

have no reason tho suspect negli-
gence on the partof the driver,
according to PAT spokesman Jason
Fincke. .
“Bus drivers will be advised in the
future, though, to be particularly

a.m., working their way through the

and talk to many of the spectators.
They then addressed their fellow
Democrats, echoing the issues and
themes raised by their parents dur-
ing the campaign.
Twenty-two—year-old Zaccaro,
who spoke for the first time on her
own Saturday morning, spoke of the
enthusiasm she and her mother met
while “hopscotching around the
country” for the last two weeks.
“The polls don't seem to reﬂect it

Mondale, 26, has been campaign-
ing for his father full-time for the
past two years.

He opened his speech to an
applauding crowd saying, “There
are only 52 days left to the election
and the night Ronald Reagan real-
izes he is not going to be sworn in for
a second term." .

His presentation touched on the
issues raised by his father during the
campaign — party unity, voter regis-

Long-term parking near the Pitt
campus, already a precious com-
modity, will be in even shorter
supply later this year when much of
Oakland joins the city’s new residen-
tial sticker parking program.

The purpose of the program is
rather simple — to force the cars of
commuting students and university
employees off the street, freeing
those spaces for Oakland residents,
both students and non-students.

Under the program, only those
with Oakland residential stickers
will be allowed to park for more
than one hour on selected streets in
central, west and south Oakland.

The program is already in use near
Magee-Womens Hospital and will
expand into the neighborhoods near
the university.

An exact start-up date has not yet
been determined. That’s because the
city has not finished printing the
stickers or erecting the necessary
signs. But it is. expected to start
sometime before the middle of the
term.

Avenue,” Fincke said. “After, all, _

one accident is one too many.”-

Ass_istant Director Walt Waters,
of the publicsafety department at.
Pitt, said that students in the area
are not always used to the counter-
ﬂowing bus lane on Fifth Avenue.
“New students arriving each fall are
not always familiar with the system
of traffic flow. This can cause prob-
lems," he said.

To prevent accidents in the past,
the department put up signs to warn
students, and they got PAT to put
up railings along Fifth Avenue,
according to Waters. They did

receive a negative reaction from ,

PAT, though, he added.

Residence Life Assistant Director
Jerry Kowalski said that he was-not
pleased with the recent rash of acci-
dents, but he added that “the” fault
does not lie with any specific group
of people. The problem lies within
the urban environment of the college
community," he said. “Students
must be aware that Pitt is not a nor-

. mal collegiate setting. ln reality,
what really separates Oakland from

the Pitt campus? Kowalski con-,

cluded, “For me, it is just a reality to
contend with."

Plotkin said he was very upset
about the whole rash of accidents.

“When you see something lilte"this>, 1., *

think the city should respond and do‘
something about it,” he said. “The

2‘ ‘. - ~ -
Gary Erenrich, the city’s principal
transportation planner, said the pro-

gram is intended to improve the

quality of the neighborhoods by
removing non-Oakland cars from its
streets, hopefully relieving parking
congestion.

Richard Meritzer, permit parking
specialist, agreed. Meritzer cited a
study conducted in central and west
Oakland that showed 78 percent of
the cars parked on the streets were
commuters’. The survey showed that c
the vast majority of cars was regis-
tered outside of Oakland. ~

Meritzer said this large percen-
tage of commuters posed a problem
for residents looking to parkitheir
own cars.

This week, the city started selling
the permits for central Oakland to
those who could show proof of
residency there. The permits will
cost $10 a year, and the fees will go
toward administering the program.

City workers are collecting the
fees, and the resident will be sent a
sticker when they are printed. Only a
lease, a current utility bill with the
resident’s name and address or a
notorized letter from the landlord
are acceptable proof of residency,

Meritzer said.

Pitt offering Grimm tales

“I usually focus on family rela-
tions in the folktales,” Ashliman
says. “But it’s not an artificial focus
because basically what they are
about are things like sibling rivalry,
parent-child relations or generation
conﬂicts. The most interesting fairy
tale conflicts are the ones that deal
with taboo subjects such as incest or
parental disobedience.”

Despite so much conflict and suf-
fering in Grimms fairytales, the
main character, no matter how
downtrodden he or she is through-
outmost of the story, always man-
ages to live “happily ever after."
Thus, the term “fairy tale ending.”
Rarely advocating any kind of dissi-
dence, fairy tales encouraged their
audience to accept whatever circum-
stance life threw their way. Because
European peasants of the 19th cen-

tury (when the Grimms recorded *

their stories) could not challenge the
political authority of the king or the
familial authority of a father, they
may have invented stories in which
the characters are often subject to
miraculous transformations over
which they have little control.
Through luck, a starving orphaned
girl without hands becomes the wife
of a king. Through magic, the ugly
unwantedfrog becomes a prince. .
Ashliman points out that if a frog
becomes a prince in a Grimms story
then it is a fairy tale, meaning it deals
with the supernatural. However, all

' fairy tales are folktales, which are

stories transmitted orally such as
jokes, anecdotes or local legends. A
true folktale is usually only a few
minutes long and has no known
author. So contrary to popular
belief, the Grimm brothers never
wrote any fairy tales of their own;

. they simply transcribed the fairy

tales of the German populace. In

addition to being literary historians,

they were also philosophers, theolo-
gists and pioneers inthe science of
folklore, something that Ashliman
himself is researching. He is cur-
rentlyiinishing a book on images of
the family in Grimms folktales. This
is only the second semester he’s
taught the Grimms folktale course
but he says that he’s used folktales in
some form in almost every other
course he’s‘ taught here at Pitt for the
past 15 years.

“The Grimms course is unusual,”
says Ashliman, “in that it can be
used to satisfy three different
requirements.;It’s a W course and it
can also be taken either as a foreign
culture course or a literature course
because it's co-sponsered by the Ger- »
man department and the Compara-
tive Lit department.”

Another unusual aspect of the
course_ is that its students use com-
puters to analyze and research the

’ tales, relying on a computer data

bank consisting of 5,000 folktales_
arranged according to subject mat-
ter. For those that have yet to master
the Apple, Ashliman spends the first
two class periods teaching students
to work the computer. He admits
that some students initially have dif-
ficulty but claims that “by the endof

the course they’ll be naming their

children after me. The computer
really is a marvelous tool."

Informal
learning

Approximately l2,00U people
people enroll in Pitt’s Informal Pro-
gram (PIP) each year. The program
offers classes, workshops and study
trips in the following areas: anthro-
pology, the arts, communications,
computers, languages, philosophy
and professional development.

No credits are awarded, no grades
are given; there are no prerequisites,
and no enrollment restrictions. “We
simply provide practical instruction
in a relaxed atmosphere,” said Nina

I’ Gowell, Director of Pitt’s Informal
Program.

“That's something we would like
to stress about the program," said
Gowell. “Many Pitt students are

‘very busy with their classes and feel
that they couldn’t possibly handle
another class, but PIP classes are
not time consuming like credited
courses.” I

“We look at PIP as the bridge that
links academics to one’s very own
career,” said Gowell.

This fall term, Pitt's Informal

I» Program offers 175 classes and
workshops, along with 33 study
trips. ‘

Although the program is a part of
Pitt, it is not funded through the
university. “PIP is funded through
its registration fees, and that is what

helped make it a successful pro- . if . , ‘-
gram,"said Gowen, Pitt Informal Program Director Nina Gowell.

The Pitt News, Wednesdrﬁl’. Scptember I.9,}.l,98i4.   I.  I      

“We are always on the watch for
topics of public interest and new
trends,” said Gowell.

Instruction for all PIP classes and
workshops is provided by University

I of Pittsburgh professors, professors
from other universities, or experts in
their respective field.

“The Fashion and Beauty Busi-
ness is one example of a workshop
added this fall because of public
interest. This particular workshop is
taught by a group of Pittsburgh pro-
fessionals of the fashion and beauty -
industry, including K. Barchetti,
President of the K. Barchetti Shops.
With this course participants can
learn about starting a new fashion or
beauty business, or expanding an

‘existingone. ‘

Another new class added this fall
is “Investing Strategies for the ‘80s.”
This‘ class examines investment
options and financial goals. The
class aims to help those with little or
no investment experience, and will
be taught by John C. Lynch, an eco-
nomic consultant to banks, corpora-

Another Pitt student is in the hospital this week after being
struck by a vehicle on Fifth Avenue. How many more will be
injured before the university and the city finally resolve this
problem?

If the students involved in these accidents were simply iso-
lated instances, there would belittle anyone could do. But this
is not the case, and the problem of accidents and near misses
between people and cars is historic and widespread on both
Fifth and Forbes Avenues. ,

The original designs for Pitt were. to have the university
centered on the hill where the Chemistry Building and Alumni
Hall now sit. The construction of the Cathedral of Learning,
initiated by Chancellor Bowman, forever rooted Pitt on Fifth
Ave. With no other direction for growth, Pitt continuously
sprawled up the hill, creating the problem we all face today.

In February of last year this paper commented on the
dangers involved in crossing Forbes Avenue. The editorial
offered several solutions to the problem and stressed the
urgency and consequences if measures to correct this problem
were not addressed. .

The editorial prompted action from Charles Pascal, Jr.,
Democratic Committeeperson from the sixth district of the
fourth ward. Pascal called on city Public Works Director Louis
Gaetano to take action to improve the safety afforded to stu-
dents as well as motorists. '

It is now seven months later, and the ominous warnings from
Pascal and this paper have gone unheeded, and students and
non-students have suffered. The city has not acted on Pascal’s

On Fifth Avenue, the cross-ﬂow traffic caused by the bus
lane makes crossing the busy street extremely ‘dangerous for
-pedestrians as well as automobiles coming onto Fifth Ave.
from the Quad Dorms.

Pitt should ban such traffic from this dormitory area." The
risks of accidents outweigh having a late-night pizza delivered
to your doorstep or having daddy drop you off a little closer to
the dorms. ' .

. According to sources close to city decision-making, the pos-
sible relocation of the bus lane to Forbes Ave. has been vehe-
mently opposed by businesses on that street. Such businesses
evidently fear a loss of revenue because of the disruptive buses.
But unless something is done, there may be a more permanant
loss of customers —— those hit by buses.

Plans to equip buses with noise devices -— emitting a beeping
sound to warn pedestrians — have been stalled because it
would require changing a law. Presently only heavy trucks and
machinery can use such devices.

IfU.S. Steel, ALCOA, Westinghouse, Rockwell, Gulf or any
of the other multinationals located in Pittsburgh wanted a
pesky ordinance or two changed, City council would be hard
pressed to find a reason to say no. It is time Pitt used some ofits

Why not ?/ Maurice Malin

The pros and consof being

Thinking about nuclear weapons
issues often evokes emotional
responses from many of us. Discus-
sion of the problem -— how to rid the
world of the threat posed by nuclear
weapons — is often emotional, sim-
plistic, and passionate. Some con-
clude with despair, “one can’t think
rationally about these things;
simply, they pose an awesome threat
which must be gotten rid of.”

A nuclear-free world may be pre-
ferable to our present day situation.
But to hope that the desire for a
world free of nuclear weapons could
or should be the basis of U.S. policy
is a hope born of well meant but

perhaps misplaced passion, not rea-_

son, and may be not only unrealistic
but dangerous. ’
Nuclear weapons exist. Even if the
superpowers were to disarm, the
knowledge and capacity to rebuild
nuclear weapons would still exist.
Thesefacts will not change, regard-
less of the emotional and passionate

desire we may have for them to do .

so. In any case, bilateral disarma-
ment would require an unprece-
dented degree of superpower trust
and cooperation, and unilateral dis-

. armament is clearly dangerous.

'Given that we live with nuclear
weapons, it would be wise to discuss
and- understand nuclear weapons
problems and issues in as rational
and intellectual a way as possible.

This is often difficult to do; the very,

existence of weapons with such
enormous destructive, power seems
primafacie irrational, almost ridicu-
lous, and certainly useless.
Indeed, many find solace for our
nuclear predicament in a simple,
wishful nuclear employment stra-

tegy called Mutual Assured Des- ~

truction (MAD). This strategy
posits that neither superpower will
lauch an "attack against the other
because it will certainly be retaliated
upon and wiped out itself.

Twenty years ago, this strategy
made sense. Neither superpoweer
really had the capability to do more
than threaten the other’s cities with
all-out retaliation. Their missiles
were few and innaccurate. A missile
defense, antithetical to the strategy
because _it reduces one’s vulnerabil-
ity, was technologiclly infeasible.

But those who advocate this stra-
tegy of deterence now are yearning
for a bygone era. Both sides have
developed highly accurate missiles,
aimed at their adversary’s military
sites (this is called “counterforce”
targeting). Both are actively devel-
oping missile and air defenses; and
the U.S. war waging plans posit
40,000 potential targets in the

I U.S.S.R. and Eastern Europe (pre-

sumably, the Soviets have similar
targeting plans). '
Clearly, solutions to our nuclear
weapons problems will not come
through bilateral disarmament,
which simply is not feasible, or

_»

I-‘ill Iiiu-inzitioniil inc.

through insistent advocation or
MAD as outlined above. As emo-
tionally appealing as these simple
solutions maybe, they fail to take
into account the reality of these
recent developments. A
Indeed, a good place to begin con-
sidering nuclear weapons issues is
through understanding the present
state of U.S. nuclear strategy. It is
simple to say that _recent develop-
ments have led up closer to nuclear
war; such developments may indi-
cate that policy makers believe that,
with highly accurate weapons and
elaborate targeting plans, a nuclear

war could be fought, perhaps even to
some “favorable” conclusion.
However, investigation and
thought may reveal that, given pres-
ent day Soviet war fighting strategy
and counterforce capability, the best
way to deter a Soviet attack may be
to convey a willingness to actually
use our forces. The Soviets do not

adhere to MAD (they label it “bour-.

geois naivette”). Our own strategy
must therefore resond to the possi-
bility that, perhaps in the time of
crisis, the Soviets may deem it in
their interests to lauch a small-scale,
limited attack. Credibly deterring

Opinions 

such an attack required the force
structures and targeting plans the
U.S. now adheres to, because they
give the president the means to ﬂexi-
bly respond to the Soviet attack.
This capability is lost through the
MAD strategy, which dictates that
our_ response, will be unbridled and
against major Soviet population
centers. The threat of such a massive
form of retaliation may not be credi-
ble against a limited attack.
Moreover, we should not be so
sure that a nuclear-free world is bet-
ter_ than a world with some nuclear
weapons. Nuclear weapons may

nuked

have actually prevented a super-
power confrontation so far, as each
side fears engaging in a conflict
which may escalate to the nuclear
level.

Whether disarmament is feasible;

whether or not our strategy leads us.

closer to, or futher from, nuclear
war; whether some nuclear weapons
are actually a good thing: These are
three of a number of serious nuclear
weapons related issues which
deserve rational debate, not just
emotional responses. To cure our
ills, we must first understand them,
as upsetting the problems may be.

PHILADELPHIA (UPI) — Ger-

aldine Ferraro had some harsh"

words for President Reagan’s stan

on arms control. *
The Democratic vice presidential

candidate accused Reagan of having

,— in her words — “fundamental

misconceptions about defense pol-
icy in the nuclear age.".

In remarks prepared for delivery
yesterday, Ferraro called this _year’s
election a “referendum on arms con-
trol and the fate of the earth.”

She said Reagan's policies are
accelerating the arms race and mak-
ing it “less controllable."

Ferraro's running mate, Walter
Mondale, said much the same thing,
charging that four years of Reagan
have made the world “more
dangerous."

LOS ANGELES (UPI) — An
unauthorized walkout by workers at
a General Motors plant in Van
Nuys, Calif., yesterday pushed to
nearly 63,000 the number of GM

' workers on strike across _the nation.

GM spokesman Harry Kelly said
that the entire first shift — 2,500
employees —— at Van Nuys was sent
home yesterday afternoon because

of ‘confusion caused when “several
hundred people” walked out.

Authorized strikes continue at 12’

GM plants, including plants in
Doraville, Ga.; Bowling Green, Ky.;
and the Michigan cities of Warren,
Flint, Lake Orion and Pontiac.
The selective walkout is costing
the company $18 million per day
and each worker about $80 per day.
The main issues in the dispute are
job security and wages. Bargaining
is scheduled to resume in Detroit
today. _ '

WASHINGTON (UPI) —— Presi-
dent Reagan met with his top advi-
sors today to decide whether to
impose limits on steel imports as the
steel industry has asked.

Reagan is expected to make a
decision by the end of the week.

Bethlehem Steel Corp. and‘ the
United Steelworkers of America
asked the administration in January
to impose quotas that would limit
steelimports ‘to 15 percent of the
American market. Imports are cur-
rently more than 20 percent of the
U.S. market.

Outside a steel plant in Cleveland
two days ago, Walter Mondale said

Although he is thinking of offer-
ing the course in the future, Ashli-
man claims that .the art of
storytelling is virtually dead. “A
great deal is lost when people don’t
tell stories to their children_ any-
more," Ashliman believes. “An oral
tale, properly told, is two-way com-

munication. The-teller receives input -
in the form of facial experessions, .

comments, sighs, and can adjust the
story to the audiencess reactions.

Mondale said Reagan's policies
are.“turning our industrial Midwest
into a rust bowl." '

QUITO, Ecuador (UPI) — A
cargo jet crashed into a residential
area of the Ecuadorian capital yes-
terday, killing at least 40 people. The
plane was taking off from a nearby
airport when it apparently lost
power and flew into the crowded
streets, ripping through churches
and homes. Authoritiessaid more
than 30 of the people killed were not
passengers of the ill-fated ﬂight.

WASHINGTON (UPI) — A spo-
kesman for the State Department
said that they have filed an official
protest accusing Moscow of a delay
in reporting the‘ detention .of five
American seamen. The_ crewmen
and‘ their ship,‘ which apparently
strayed into Soviet waters,’ were
seized on Sept. 12. However, the
U.S. was not notified until two days
later. The seamen are expected to be
put on a U.S. Coast Guard cutter

_today.

those with stickers. Oakland.desig-

‘nations will be “B. C, D, and E."
according to Meritzer. Oakland resi-
dents should be aware the sticker
applies to just one zone. A car with a
“B” sticker parked in a “C" zone for
more than one hour will be ticketed.

Leonard Prosser, supervisor or
enforcement for the program, said
all unstickered cars will be ticketed.
He said his department will hire two
new employees to help police
Oakland.

Prosser doesn’t know what will
happen during Pitt football games
when thousands of fans search for
parking places, but he said his peo-
ple will be there ticketing any ille-

gally parked cars.

City officialsbelieve Oakland has
enough available public parking to
handle the commuters, and they said
Oakland is well-serviced by public
transportation, so many can leave
their cars at home.

Meritzer said Oakland has “the
best public tranportation system in
the city.” He said there wasn’t “a real
need". for people to drive in
Oakland. - -

One cummuter, Pitt student
Lynda Sailor, said she understands

.the residents‘ concerns about park-

ing but commented that Oakland
“wouldn’t be anything without com-
muters.’.‘ She said the city shouldn’t
“ignore” commuters.

But Oakland residents long for
the day when they won’t have to
park three blocks from home. Tom
Wanko' of 4! Boundary Street
summed up the neighborhood
sentiment: ’

“Its about time!“ he said with a
sigh.

the Soviet Union, where it may have
caused severe damage.

are given marijuana if the drug is
illegal. Mrs. Reagan said that she
didn’t thinkit was true that cancer
patients are treated with marijuana.

The Pitt News, Wednesday, September I9,‘ 1984

PPC needs help

Have you ever wondered what it
would be like to arrange a concert
with the Pointer Sisters, from con-
tract negotiations to the production
itself? Or a performance of the Chi-
nese Magic Circus of Taiwan? How
about a abstract art exhibit? Or a
parade and carnival for
Homecoming? »

These are just a few of the pro-
grams which the Pitt Program
Council offers every semester to stu-
dents, as well as the unique oppor-.
tunity to take part, as members, in
their selection and planning.

Made up of nearly 300 members,
the PPC‘ is chartered by the Stu-
dent Activities Office as a student
organization, run and managed by
students themselves. Twelve com-
mittees, each chaired by an under-
graduate student, work together to
provide a balanced program of edu-
cational, cultural, recreational and
social activities for the campus
community.

Joining the PPC, is a unique
opportunity for students to gain
practical experience in the selection
and planning of programs coming to
Pitt and also provides the chance to
meet and become involved with
celebrities from the entertainment
and art worlds.

According to Rick Fogle, one of
the two advisors who serve as sup-
port for the Council, the PPC pro-
vides the opportinity to develop
communication and organizational
skills necessary in the business
world. “Most people have no experi-
ence in a real work atmosphere",
says Fogle. “After you've worked
with the PPC you have something
more to follow up on with your
resume. The responsibility gives you

something concrete, and a chance to

gain recognition through the work
you've done.” ’

Open for membership to any Pitt
student with a valid I.D. and a QPA
of 2.0, the PPC seeks input and help
from all segments of the university in
the planning and production of its

. programs.

As members, students are given
the chance to represent the needs
and.wants of the campus community

‘through their vote; they select which

programs and what type of pro-

grams will be presented. Chairmen
direct the activities of the commit- ,

tee. The final decision and work are
done by the members themselves.
Members can be expected to be
involved in negotiating performers’
contracts, as well as publicizing and
producing the programs.

Stu'dent Coordinator Al Frioni,
whose job it is to ensure that the
requirements of the PPC constitu-
tion are followed by each commit-
tee, says that “the PPC is a
supplementary education that your
classes cannot teach you. I’ve
learned more, being a chairperson
and student coordinator, about
leadership, professionalism and
dealing with people than I ever could
have in any class. Right away, they
gave me responsibility.” F rioni also
stressed that students are not too
young to get involved and take on
that responsibility. “Once inside the

PPC, ” he said, “you learn that the _

most important thing is student
your chance to
grow." '

Laura McKeever, who has served
as a.committe chairman three times,
says that there is a lot of pride in the
work done at the PPC. “I think this
organization has a quality which is
different from others; it’s very pow-
erful, and students delegate that
power, “McKeever says. “You have
to learn cooperation, because you’re
all programming for one thing: the
Program Council. It's a realistic
experience that you can carry with
you into the work world after you

‘leave college." .

The twelve committees which
make up the Pitt Program Council
are as follows: ‘

0Committee on the Arts: Selects,
contracts and produces major art
programs ranging from theatre and
dance to art shows and instrumental

9 and vocal performances.

William’ Christopher and Elie
Wiesel.

travel opportunities for Pitt stu-

dents. Past excursions include -the.

Auto Mechanics and Cosmetology. A

0Recreation: Sponsors tourna-
ments in table tennis, billiards, video

Brenner, Marc Weiner and the Wei-
nerettes and the Summer Film

0Student Coordinator Position
(Not a Committee): The duties of the
Student Coordinator include the
implementation and execution of
the constitution; to preside over the
meetings of the Board of Governors
and Executive Board; to represent
the _Pitt Program Council at all offi-
cial functions; to interpret the con-
stitution, and to prepare a budget
for the year.

Any student wishing to join the
Pitt Program Council simply has to
fill out an application at the Pro-
gram Council offices in the William
Pitt Union, indicating one’s choice
of committee for membership. I

Since the PPC is an independent .

organization and is funded by the
student activities fees collected by

' the university from all Pitt students,
_ it is free from campus politics. Each

committee makes its selection of
programs by a vote of all its
members, giving everyone a voice in
the matter.

Once you have joined the Pitt
Program Council, be prepared for
the experience of a lifetime.

elderly

By Sonja Alexander
The Pitt News

Rescuing puppies and caring for
the sick are two services that one
would not normally consider
together," but a new concept called
Pet Therapy has fused them.

Pet Therapy was started about
five years ago in the Oakland area by
the Animal Rescue League. In this
program, puppies are taken to
homebound patients and nursing
homes. Some of the nursing homes

. in this area that participate in this

program are The Nursing Home and
Shadyside Manor.

Puppies produce no long term
benefits but do affect the emotional

state of some patients. Joyful memo-
ries are brought back to those who
had pets before they entered these
homes. Stress is also reduced when
these puppies are around. Puppies
aid in lowering blood pressure and
improve communication between
the staff and the patients.

The puppies are brought in to visit
on weekdays when there are a lot of

"visitors. The puppies cost nothing

because they are brought ot the
homes by volunteers or by the nurs-
ing home staff. Estel Wagner of the
Animal Rescue League feels that
this idea is a good one for boththe
patient and the animals. Debbie
Brinker, Activities Director of The
Negley House Nursing Home also
considers the animals a help to the
patients. -

Netters slam
WELJ, now 2-0

By Bob Travers
The Pitt News

Well. at least one Pitt sports team
remains unbeaten. ‘

The Lady Panthers women’s ten-
nis team upped its record to 2-0 by
defeating ‘Washington & Jefferson
yesterday at Trees Courts. Jodi
Levine and Rhonda Gibbs switched
places from Friday's win over
Carnegie-Mellon. This time it was
Levine's turn to dominate her
match, while Gibbs had to struggle
to notch a victory.

Levine, the No. 1 singles player,
won easily in straight sets, 6-0, 6-1.
“My serve and volley were working
well today,” Levine said. “I got
psyched up to play and Ixwent out
there really wanting to win and I did
it.”

Gibbs was able to stage a come-
from-behind victory over Jennifer
Spicer, 4-6, 6-1, 6-4, because, as she
said, she kept her cool. “A key to
tennis is to have peace within. Just
have peace of mind. The important
thing is that I kept a positive attitude
the entire match. I never got down

when I was behind and I came

back. " '
A’ host of distractions which
included an intramural softball

game on a nearby field and a low‘

ﬂying Life-Flight helicopter failed to
disturb Gibbs’ concentration. “The
heat, the helicopter and things don't
bother me. I'm used to playing with
distractions.” J

Head coach George Dieffenbach

said much of the credit for the win

should go to the three players who
staged three-set victories after losing
the first set.

“Gibbs, Carrie DeVera.and Col-
leen Driscoll, I was very impressed
with. They showed a lot of character
and played intelligent tennis. That is
the mark of a good player."

The coach talked to each player

  pikers dig into IUP, Duquesne 

By Laurie Kubli‘
The Pitt News

The Pitt women’s spiking
machine revved up its engines in
preparation for a big weekend by
running down Duquesne and Indi-
ana University of Pennsylvania last
night in the Duchesses’ gym, win-
ning the best-of-three matches in

_ two games each.

Pitt defeated Duquesne 15-7, 15-
l l, but hit a few rough spots on the

.way to winning /its first non-

before the ﬁnal sets. “I tookthem
aside and talked to them about their
strategy, that they had to attack
their opponents’ weaknesses. They
listened, and that is what clinched
the match for us." .
Indeed, it was these three victories
that were at the heart of the Pitt win.
If the Lady Panthers had dropped
any of these matches it would have
meant Pitt could not have clinched
the match in singles play as it did.

‘And if the third set would have gone, '
_ W&J would have taken.a four match

to two lead going into the three dou-
bles matches which follow the sin-
gles play.

Jennifer Leach coasted to a two-

set win, 6-1, 6-3. “The heat wasn't a

factor for me at all. I just played a
good match.” , ' .

It wasn't so easy for Stephanie
Nelson, the Lady Panthers’ No. 5
player, who lost 6-7, 2-6. Included in
that first set was a tie-breaker which
Nelson lost, 7-2. She said, “I need to
hit my strokes better, I wasn’t con-
sistent at all today and my opponent
was. I can play a lot better than
today and that's what I have to do.”

At on particularly frustrating
moment Nelson threw her racquet to
the ground in disgust. “I lost my
patienceand my temper," she said of
her John McEnroe impersonation.

For Carrie DeVera, it was all a _
matter of loosening up: “I was play-_

ing tense at first, but after a while I
loosened up and played _ better.”
DeVera, a winner at 3-6, 6-3, 6-1,
said she was more nervous today
than in the opener Friday.

Levine, ‘in comparing the "team's
first two matches of the season, said,
“W&J is more consistent and more
experienced than CMU." Of her
own team's play she remarked, “This
was a good win. Now we're ‘2-0’ and
ready to have a.- good season. We
really hung together out there when
we were down.“

It was that togetherness and team
spirit that gave the team the most

exhibition match. IUP fell harder
and faster, losing to Pitt l5-2, l5-2.

—“We got some of the early-season‘
jitters out of our system,” remarked
head , coach Shelton Collier. _“We
have work to do. We'll really-see
what needs to be done this weekend
when we'll be tested.”

It was a stiff test for Duquesne’s '

first-year coach Mike Petock, who
played for Pitt's men's volleyball
team before it became a club. Petock
still plays for the club and is taking
coaching classes at Pitt.

"Pitt is by far the hardest team
we'll face," Petock said. “It gives me
a good idea on what we need to work

on. I was impressed, but we were
tentative, especially ‘after Sandy
Bachman got hit ‘in the face.”

“ Wegot some of the
early season jitters out of _
our system...” ‘

Coach Collier

Bachman, who fell after the hit,
said the spiked ball struck the side of
her neck. She was standing in the
backc_ourt at the time.

The host team appeared to be
intimidated by Pitt's line-drive

spikes. Senior Ulana Kohutiak hit
eight killshots in the match, and
Cathy Rupp played a role in 17 of 30
points by slamming seven kills and
assisting on l0 more. Junior Sally
Gillespie, ‘who alternates between

' setting and playing defense, gar-

nered four service aces, five assists
and five digs. '

Duquesne took a brief 8-5 lead
midway through the second game,
but Gillespie served six points to
regain the lead for Pitt.

Petock did not think Pitt's serving
was as good as it would have been in
a larger gym or in Fitzgerald Field
House. “They're used to serving I2
feet behind the line, and here they
had to stay two or three feet back,”

Petock stated. “They let up on a few.

No one [from Pitt] served as hot in.

the match as in the ‘warr'nup.“

Collier. was satisfied with his
team's serving. “I was concerned
about playingin a small gym," Col-

lier said. “We serve aggressively, so a-

small _ gym sets us back, but we
adapted pretty well. I think we were
impressive."

Panthers to start new season

Panthers looked vicious enough
to "warrant top national stature
with Texas, Nebraska and
Auburn.

Then, two fell swoops left Pitt
hanging lifeless. The vultures,
Brigham Young and Oklahoma,
came to prey. In short, the Pitt
offense looks the part of a bewil-
dered, lost boy while its defense
looks like one would after being
trapped on a treadmill. Twenty-
four points in two games just
doesn’t cut it, though an 0-2

“I don’t really know what went '

_ everyone is talking of the start of

“our new season."

That being the case, head
coach Foge Fazio now takes
stock of what’s led the Panthers
to this worst start in 14 Oakland
autumns. “Let’s get a few things
straight,” the third-year skipper
began. “There’s too much blame
placed on the offensive line.
Look at me. I’m the guy who gets
it. So I'll take it all.” '

Of the line performance Satur-
day, Fazio added, “Look at it.

Busted assignments. here, plays,

stuffed there. The offensive line,
their intensity may be such that
we asked of them too much.”
It is a line that averages a
healthy 265 pounds yet has
blocked for only ‘I78 rushing
yards and a‘measly 415 passing in
two games. It is a line that’s
waited patiently while 83 passes
have been attempted for an

’ abominable 42 percent comple-

tion rate.

Still, Fazio blames a blitz of I
, playbook strategy that has left

the live down linemen in’a tizzy.

“There have been too many
pass-blocking plays and too
many run-blocking plays to per-
fect what we want to do,” Fazio
said. “What happens is you go to
camp, put things in, the guys
grasp it well, they look good in
scrimmage and then you add
some more.” A

And the coaches did that this
year because the line was one of
veterans, and not one that last
year played it simple in the Ten-
nessee opener and increasingly
grasped more for the _Notre
Dame and Penn State battles.

If two losses don’t change the
philosophy, loss of a starting
quarterback will. Junior John
Congemi probably won’t start
until next month, while the line
waits until late this week to find
out whether it will be John Cum-
mings, Chris Jelic or Dante
Wiley. Congemi severely
sprained his right ankle against
Oklahoma.

Fazio hedges quite well,
though fairness dictates that a
couple practice sessions provide
the best way to name a starter:
“It's very interesting to be in a
situation like this; all three guys
are very attentive.”

Christy, weathering this bar-
rage of criticism blown his and
others‘ way, isn't too ‘concerned
about who's named. “It won’t

changegmuch. I played with _

[Cummings] at camp and
Dante’s been‘ in there. The
offense believes in them.”

Yes, but can anyone still place
belief in the Pitt offense? The
starting quarterback is gone. The
running backs aren’t breaking
big yardage plays. And there has

been no sign of a 70- or 80-yard.

drive that brings out the sparkle

. in highlight footage.

' “I feel that I see what’s hap-
pening," Christy said. “I want to
get the other guys going. After
somebody misses a block, you
see the mistakes and want to
improve. You don’t want to
make more mistakes.”

Maybe this supposed quan-
dary Pitt is in has its benefits.
There’s no pressure, Fazio will
admit as readily as he will the
offense “has no identity" now.
Pitt will travelto Philadelphia's
Veterans Stadium Saturday
afternoon and merely play hard-
nosed football and forget the
strategy that so far seems as if a
computer spewed it out.

the most boring seasons in recent

tling it out.

Strategy that backfired in two
games is being scrapped. Past
failure leads to new lesso_ns.

“The criticism? We’re used to
that," Fazio continued. We were
criticized when we were 7-0 [’82]
and not beating the point
spreads. When you’re in a posi-
tion as head coach, I don’t want
the criticism bestowed on assist-
ant coaches or players. We can
do that behind closed doors. -I

‘ don’t} want to alienate them. I
want to keep them loose.

“We have problems, but when 1

you have them, we don’t make
, excuses. We’ll solve those
, problems.”

GRID BITS: ‘Sophomore
Chuckie Scales, recruited as a
tailback out of ' Shadyside
Academy, will be primarily used
at ﬂanker now. Calling him
“another threat for us outside,"
Fazio said of Scales, “He’s a
breaker. When he catches the
ball, look out. Like.No. 3 [Der-
rick Shepard] and No. 4 [Buster
Rhymes] of Oklahoma. It’s a
thrill. Go watch a defensive back

. try to tackle either one.” Scales
‘has rushed for 60 yards and
caught three passes for 24 yards
this season.
_ Although J elic is considered as
one of three quarterback candi-
dates, he originally left that spot
in the second day of camp to
focus on playing in the defensive
backfield. Since then he has
punted in two games and has
been averaging 37.] yards after
15 kicks. .

the first team since the 1927 New

Although the season has been
boring, some of the players haven't
been. The success story of the season
has been 'Mets rookie pitcher
Dwight Gooden. Last
Gooden struck out 16 Pirates and in

‘ doing so, broke the major league

record for strike outs in a season by a
rookie. On Monday night, Gooden
repeated his performance, this time
against the Philadelphia Phillies.
Gooden broke the NL record for
strikeouts in two consecutive games
with 32 and for three games with 43.
Both marks were previously held by
former Dodger Sandy Koufax.

As‘ the end of the season

can overtake Minnesota and Kansas
City. Jackson, the designated hitter
for the Angels, hit his 500th career
home run on Monday night in a los-
ing effort to the Royals, to join only
12 other major leaguers to reach that
mark. That’s a lot of home runs and
just think, he . never got to play

game. Which shell is this week's
quarterback under? Shell number
one: John Congemi, last year's start-
ing quarterback at the beginning of
the year, has little experience and a
lot less good experience. His only
touchdown this season was thrown
to an Oklahoma defensive back.
Shell number two: defensive back
Chris Jelic. Sowhat if he hasn’t

played offense all year?
Finally, shell number -three:

Freshman Dante Wiley. Wiley, a,

‘ Parade All—America from

I‘ Jeannette, performed well at camp
this fall; But Wiley isa freshman and -

freshmen take time and patience,
two things Panthers fans are not
very willing to give right now. How-
ever, if Pitt puts Wiley in, they could
end up with a veteran quarterback
for the future, to go with a young
running corps of freshman_Charles
Gladman and sophomore Tom
Brown. The only problem with that
is: will Foge be around for the

PITTSBURGH (UPI) ‘— The city
of Pittsburgh saluted Olympic gold
medalist Roger Kingdom and three
other Olympians yesterday and
presented them with the key to the
city.

Kingdom, a student here at the
University of Pittsburgh, rode
through downtown Pittsburgh in an
eight-car motorcade. Joining King-
dom were swimmer Sue Heon, also
of Pitt, marksman John Rost, and
soccer" player Erhardt Kapp.

The four Olympians were greeted

' in Mellon Square by 15,000 fans, six
Pitt cheerleaders, Mayor Richard
Caligiuriand other officials.

The mayor gave the Olympians a

key to the city and proclaimed Tues-
’ day as “Salute to Pittsburgh area

Football Happenings

NEW YORK (UPI) —— The UPI
Board of Coaches once again placed
the Nebraska Cornhuskers atop the
UPI College Football Ratings. The
Cornhuskers rolled past Minnesota,
38-7, last weekend. Nebraska
received 34 first-place votes, com-
pared to second-ranked Texas,
which received four. Texas climbed
from third tosecond after an impres-
sive 35-27 win over Auburn.

The  News, Wednesday, September 19 I984

ports briefs  

Oklahoma moved to No. 3 after
stomping Pitt 42-I0, while another
Panther nemesis, Brigham Young,
jumped to the fourth slot. Rounding
out the Top I0 were Penn State,
Ohio State, Boston College,
Washington, Miami and UCLA.

SEATTLE (UPI) — University of
Washington Head Coach Don
James has labeled a report that he
has contacted the University of Flor-
ida about the school's head coaching
job as "ridiculous."

James, in his tenth season at
Washington, has built one of the
nation’s top college football\ pro-
grams at the PAC-I0 Conference
school. He is currently unbeaten in
two games and ranked eighth in‘the
UPI rankings. .

Florida is in the market for a new
head coach after Charley Pell was
fired over the weekend.

Around The NFL

PITTSBURGH (UPI) —- Steel-
ers’ Coach Chuck Noll says that this
year’s team reminds him of his l974_
team, the first of four Super Bowl

winners. The Steelers are 2-1 and,a-re.

the only team in the AFC Central
Division with a win. Pittsburgh can
improve its division lead by knock-
ing off the Browns Sunday in Cleve-
land. The Steelers are a

two-and-one-half point favorite to

win.

MIAMI (UPI) — Miami Dolphin
Coach Don Shula says he doesn’t
know what‘ to expect from Dan
Marino. The former Pitt quarter-
back tossed three touchdown passes
as he led the unbeaten Dolphins to a
21-17 victory over the Buffalo Bills
Monday night. But Shulasays, “We
don’t know him well enough to tellif
this is a typical game for him. He has
only been on the team two years.”

Marino’s three scoring passes give
him 10 for the season so far.

INDIANAP.OLIS (UPI) — The
Indianapolis Colts have_ asked the
NFL to investigate an incident that
occurred during last Sunday's game
against the St. Louis Cardinals.

MIAMI (UPI) — The Miami
Dolphins report no progress in the
search for a running back to replace
the injured Andra Franklin. Coach
Don Shula is hoping the return of
Joe Carter from a shoulder injury
will help the situation. Carter has
missed the first three games of the
season. ,

Franklin is sidelined with a knee
injury and efforts to replace him.
have failed. Due to the death of
David Overstreet last summer, the
Dolphins were in need of a runner
even before F ranklin went down.

Last week, Miami traded for San
Diego's Chuck Muncie and signed
free agent Rickey Young. Both run-
ning backs failed their physical
examinations after urine tests
revealed the presence of an active
ingredient found in marijuana.

Tennis Notes

PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fl.
(UPI) —— The Women’s Tennis Asso-
ciation ruled that Chris Evert
Lloyd’s 56-match victory streak will
be reset at 55.

The decision handed down now
means that Martina Navratilova can
break the record tonight at a tourna-
ment in Bonaventure, Florida. Mar-
tina opens in a first-round match

against 16-year-old Melissa Brown

of New York.

_ The WTA checked the validity of
Lloyd’s streak after tennis statisti-
cians and reporters at the U.S. Open
noted that one victory came by
default.

Navratilova tied the mark when

she defeated Evert Lloyd in the
finals of this year’s U.S. Open.

For those looking for the Pitt
women’s cross" country team, don’t
waste any time. With only three
members, the squad can hardly be
considered a team. Nonetheless
Coach Elbert Kennedy does not
appear too discouraged. He consid-
ers this 1984 season one in which to
build. '

Junior Amy DiFrancesco, the

sole returnee from 1983, will be
joined by freshmen Joyce Zinski and
Debbie Wreiley.

“Right now it seems as if Amy
may be the only runner eligible to be
competitive. Although the freshmen
had done well in high school, it
could take at least a year to condi-
tion them for Division I competi-
tion,” Kennedy said.

Kennedy doesn’t believe that join-
ing the Big East Conference is a det-
riment, although he said he believes
there are runners at Pitt who are
frightened to come out because of
what the Big East stands for in pres-
tige and top competition.

Obviously it will take time to
develop ‘ a similarly competitive
team, and, in turn, a staunch reputa-
tion. That eventualy serves as means
to recruit top-ranked high school
runners. ‘

“In order to build, you need the '

tools to work with,” Kennedy said.
“Right now nationally ranked
runners are going to schools with
good reputations, such as West Vir-
ginia and California State [Pa.], but
I’m looking to recruit for next year
already.

“Although I'm looking at middle I

and long distance runners whose
emphasis will be on track and field,
they can be conditioned to run in the
cross country meets.” Kennedy is
not discouraged. But he does realize
it will take patience. Then again, all
good things do.

sewed up victory number two for the
Lady Panthers.

The match was the No. 6 singles,
between Colleen Driscoll of Pitt and
Katie Bell of W&J. It was an emo-
tional Driscoll who found herself
down 1-6‘after the first set. She was_
the only Pitt player to lose in the
CMU match, and her confidence
was wavering. She admitted, “I was
in tears after the first set and Julie
[teammate Julie Gress] just talked to
me and told me not to worry and
forget the first set, and just go out
i’ and relax and play tennis. I couldn’t
have done it without the help of my
teammates.”

After a day off today, Pitt will
host Slippery Rock (3:30, Trees

Spikers win
two matches

continued from page thirteen

Gillespie opened the first game by
serving for eight consecutive points,
and freshman Krista Zeiner served
six points in the middle of the second
game in her first collegiate match.

Kris Wexell, who was not
expected to play, was “integrated
back into the lineup,” according to
Collier, “so she’s comfortable this
weekend, and so the team’s comfor-
table." Wexell played with an ice
pack taped to her hip, which she

injured in practice last week.

Collier was happy with the job his
team did in view of the absence of
fourth-year starter and captain Judy
Young, who was lost to mononu-
cleosis last week, and Wexell’s “part-
time” work. He played everyone but
Young and was content with the per-
formances his three freshmen did.

“They each have specific roles to
play. Carolyn Brown did a greatjob
fulﬁlling her role, coming in on
defense, even with no collegiate
experience. Krista Zeiner and
Louise O’Shaughnessy did a good
job and are both going to be counted
on.”

The spikers travel to Philadelphia
to participate in the Temple Invita-
tional and will meet’ Princeton and
defending Big East champion Provi-
dence, who upset Pitt in last season’s
final.
