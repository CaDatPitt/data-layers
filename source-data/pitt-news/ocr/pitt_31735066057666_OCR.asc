By Christine Hanna

By chance of stopping in
a Beverly Hills leather
goods store to buy a brief-
case in 1980, Thomas
Keneally used an
Australian credit card
which took 15 minutes to
clear, sparking a change in
his life.

Within that time, he met
the owner of the store, a
Holocaust survivor, who
told him the story of a
German Nazi who showed
decency toward him and
other Jews.

Students utilize volunteer option

By Nicole Walz
For The Pitt News

Junior Katie Delaney is one
of many students who tutor
area school children each
week. The tutors volunteer
twice a week at surrounding
elementary and middle schools
as part of Pitt Project Tutor.

“I started tutoring because I
wanted to get involved in
community service,” said
Delaney. “Pitt Project Tutor
was widely publicized, so it
was easy to get involved with
it.” ‘

Pitt Project Tutor is just one
of the many volunteer oppor-

tunities available through the A

Center for Student Community
Service.

The center has information
on over 100 agencies that need
volunteers, with issues ranging
from tutoring, animal rights,
the environment, AIDS and
many others.

The program coordinators,
Larry Bartlebaugh and Molly
Mulhem, said all students are
welcome, and all they need to
do is register through the cen-
ter.

“If those agencies don’t
have an opportunity [that
meets the needs of the stu-
dents], I will search for an

agency that will,” said
Bartlebaugh. '

The most popular programs
are the tutoring programs and
the the mental health pro-
grams. Bartlebaugh said he
would like to develop the

environmental awareness pro-

grams more. The center is
always looking for new volun-
teering ideas as well, she said.

Presently, the center has
approximately 700 students in
its database.

dents placed and referred to

Battling
alcohol

abuse: a
naﬁonal
problem

By Chris Lombardo
and Kate Scholl

I The Pitt News

(This is the third ofa three—part
series on underage (lrinkiizg. )

The problem of underage
drinking is one aspect of the
larger issue of alcohol abuse on
college campuses.

It’s not a new issue, but
increased awareness of the seri-
ous consequences are triggering
scrutiny of what universities are
doing to address the problem of
excessive drinking and its
results.

Recent events such as the
alcohol overdose death of Pitt
student Atif Bhatti, the alleged
sexual assault at a Pitt fraternity
house and the drunk—driving
accident that killed student
Faith Savasta a year-and-a—half
ago have violently demonstrat-
ed the destructiveness of alco-
hol abuse at Pitt. However,
studies show that Pitt is not
alone.

Ninety-five percent of violent
crimes and 53 percent of
injuries on U.S. college cam-
puses are alcohol related,
according to a recent federal
student survey conducted by the
Center on Addiction and
Substance Abuse. The study
also reports that in 90 percent of
all campus rapes, the assailant,
the victim or both had been
drinking.

A study from Columbia
University conducted last year
reported that the average col-
lege student drinks 34 gallons

"Black Nativily” opens Kwanzaa season atPiI1

By Erica Glasspool
Staff Writer

Just in time to open the Kwanzaa sea-
son, the African Drum and Dance
Ensemble and the Kuumba Workshop will
present a production of “Black Nativity.”

The “Black Nativity,” an African-
American gospel drama written by
Langston Hughes, will be performed at
Stephen Foster Memorial on Dec. 3 and 4
at 3:00 p.m.

“The ‘Black Nativity’ is a musical nar-
ration about the birth of Jesus Christ using
African dance and musical song,” said
Shona Sharif, artistic director of the

African Drum and Dance Ensemble.

Hughes’ “Black Nativity” was first per-
formed at the York Theater and later at
President Kennedy’s International Jazz
Festival before moving on to the Festival
of Two Worlds at Spoleto in Italy.

The play is now being performed in
almost every major city across the nation
and was done in Pittsburgh from 1989-92
by the Wilkinsburg Arts Council.

The African Dance and Drum Ensemble
and Kuumba Workshop picked up the play
this year after a one year hiatus.

The Kuumba Workshop consists of chil-
dren from the ages of 5 to 15 from under-
privileged communities. It provides chil-

dren with the chance to learn skills it
African dance and drum technique and tr
participate in performances all over the
city of Pittsburgh.

Sharif has worked with the Kuumbz
Workshop for the past four years and saic
she thought the performance of “Blaclx
Nativity” was a good opportunity to help
the students grow.

“The play is heated with a lot of spiritu-
ality and fun with beautiful costumes,’
said Sharif. This will mark the Kuumba
Workshop’s first professional debut.

Before writing “Black Nativity,’
Hughes founded Negro theaters ir

NAPLES, Italy — Two peo-

when the cruise liner Achille
luuro caught ﬁre off the coast
of East Africa yesterday.

Ships in the area rescued the
900 passengers and crew mem-

the ship’s owner said the cause
of the blaze, which appears to
have started in the passenger
quarters, was not known, but
arson has been ruled out as a
possibility.

According to the passenger

a surge in businesses planning

economy surged more than was
previously thought, the

product grew at a 3.9 percent
annual rate between July and
September, .5 percent higher
than expected, and just under
the second quarter’s pace.
More money was spent on
building factories and machin-

recent quarter, and the biggest
decline was in the rate of
inventory building. — Reuters

dents,” Bartlebaugh said. “A
lot of students are volunteer-
ing, just not through us. There
are more than we know
about”

The center began two years
ago as the Pitt Volunteer
Action Center, under the
coordination of Nicole
Monastra. The first year was a
growing period of building a
database of students and mak-
ing contacts in agencies. It is
now located in Room 119 of
the William Pitt Union.

Some of the center’s future
projects are the Martin Luther
King Jr. Week of Community
Service from Jan. 9-15 and
the Pennsylvania Service
Scholars.

“In honor of Martin Luther
King, Jr. and his commitment
to community service, we are
sponsoring a week-long com-
munity service celebration,”
said Bartlebaugh. The goal is
to have over 1,000 students
participating in community
service that week.

There are many different
reasons for volunteering,
Bartlebaugh said. Students
can gain experience relevant
to their major and build a
resume at the same time.

“We have accountants who
volunteer in agencies to do
the payroll,” Bartlebaugh
said.

Other students feel it is a
moral obligation, or want to
work for social issues that are
important to them.

‘A lot of students in the
school Delaney has tutored
have difficult family situa-
tions, such as broken homes
or drug abuse, Delaney said.

Delaney said tutoring, to
her, is not all aboutteaching
what is in a textbook.

“I usually try to do my own
creative ideas. I had both the
girls I tutor make a collage
when the goal for the week
was self-confidence  IfI

can’t make their lives differ— '

ent, then at least I can make a
difference in their lives,” said
Delaney.

“I think it is important to
make a difference in the com-
munity,” Delaney said. “If
you have the time and the
skills, why not?”

of alcohol per year. Students
spend an estimated $5'.5"billion
on alcohol each year, which is
more than their books and non-
alcoholic drinks combined. The
traditional university response to
the mounting evidence of alco-
hol’s harmful effects is partici-

Week, an educational program
focusing on alcohol abuse o_n
campus and responsible drink-
ing. Pitt participates in this pro-
gram each year.

“Beyond the one week, we
considered what else we could
do,” said Leon Haley, vice chan-
cellor for student and public
affairs. He mentioned other
actions Pitt has taken, including
sending 3,800 letters to fresh-
men students’ parents “re—
emphasizing the importance of
alcohol awareness” and the for-
mation earlier this year of a task
force on alcohol and substance
abuse. “That committee is
charged with looking at prob-
lems on campus and how we
can respond,” said Haley. After

Pitt’s Student Health Service
offers classes and educational
programs dealing with sub-
stance abuse. In general, the uni-
versity tries to handle cases on
an individual basis, said Dennis
Donham, assistant vice chancel-
lor for student affairs. Although
legal penalties for underage
drinking are stiff, few students
end up facing the loss of driving
privileges and ﬁnes called for by
the law.

Like Pitt, most universities
focus on education and preven-
tion rather than sanctions.

At other colleges and univer-
sities, new programs are being
initiated. Many schools now
have substance-free dorms or

is another tactic. Some schools

exemplifies a broad-based
approach that some schools are
taking. It integrates inebriation—
free dorm life with a campus-
wide wellness education pro-
gram that offers workshops and
publications for students on all
aspects of healthful living. The
University of Connecticut and
Boston College, schools compa-
rable in size to Pitt, have similar
programs.

Haley did not want to com-
ment specifically on the possi-
bility of any such programs at
Pitt, although he said, “We want
to stretch the limits of our capac-
ity or even borrow ideas from
other institutions that might be
appropriate for us to consider.”

In response to the published
story about underage drinking in
the Oakland bars, questions con-
cerning campus police involve-
ment with bars have surfaced.

How closely do campus police .

monitor the ins and outs of the
Oakland bar scene?

Pitt Department of Public
Safety Director Rick Boyd com-
mented, “They don’t have juris-

diction to take action inside bars
unless requested by _city police.
Their speciﬁc responsibility is to
control crowds that gather in
that general area and from ﬁghts
breaking out. To hold down
rowdiness is really what they’re
there for.”

When asked why a university
police officer was in Zelda’s the
night Kevin Kramer was admit-
ted illegally, Boyd responded,
“His reason forbeing there had
to be unofficial. Our officers are
not allowed to work as bouncers
or ID checkers.” Boyd said cam-
pus police are solely responsible
for areas owned by the
University of Pittsburgh.

Because there can be no direct
steps taken by the university to
combat underage drinking in
campus bars, it is and will
always be up to the students to
behave responsibly. Haley said
he believes the school can still
influence students to make
responsible choices. “The uni-
versity system is about making
choices, opening minds and
thinking clearly."

The Pitt News, Thursday, December 30, 1994
 

Author

-From page I
Keneally, who took the information
and two years later put to bed the
award-winning book, “Schindler’s
List.” “No, second to last, [Steven]
Spielberg was last.”

Approximately 300 people listened
to Keneally, who is from Australia,
speak about researching the book,
working with Spielberg on the
Academy Award-winning Schindler's
List and seeing race hate last night
in a lecture, sponsored by Pitt
Program Council, in the William Pitt
Union Assembly Room.

“This man [Pfefferberg] had once
been declared a subhuman. A whole
system, an extravagant system 
had been devoted to exterminating
him because he was a virus
on Western civilization,” Keneally
said. “What an astounding proposi-
tion that was. All race hate carried to
a limit is absurd  The way the SS
brought the European tradition of
anti-semitism to a head was very fas-
cinating.

“And so out of recklessness I began
to research the book.”

Keneally said he began research by
talking to survivors in Australia, Los
Angeles, New York, Europe and
Israel.

He also used two file cabinets con-
taining Schindler letters, photographs,
transcripts of speeches and testi-
monies that Pfefferberg saved.

Various survivors introduced
Keneally to other survivors and stood
as referees. “They had no reason to
talk to a writer who wasn’t Jewish,”
he said.

Keneally said he found that
Schindler was a remarkable man. He
may have been a womanizer, a black
marketeer and a drunk; however, he
bribed Nazi officials so he could pre-
tend to run a labor camp so that Jews
would not be sent to extermination
camps, Keneally said.

According to Keneally, Schindler
also blew the whistle on the Nazis to
officials in Budapest and Istanbul.

His book hit page one of The New

York Times Book Review and accord-
ing to Keneally, did very well.

Keneally said Spielberg read the
review, then the book and then con-
tacted him. “From the time we met, I
knew he was interested in the same
questions I was.”

Spielberg bought the film rights to
“Schindler’s List” in March of 1983
and then had trouble with screenwrit-
ers, including Keneally, and was wor-
ried about reception, he said.

“I wrote the first draft. It wasn’t far
enough from the book, Spielberg
said.”

Keneally said Pfefferberg called
Universal and Spielberg at least a
couple times a week to tell them
“Schindler’s List” was a great story
and if they would make it, it would
win them an Academy Award, which
it did.

A decade later Spielberg’s film was
completed, and he flew Keneally and
his wife to the premiere in
Washington, D.C. “I quite liked it,”
he said.

Keneally said he was so mesmer-
ized by the film that he did not notice
Spielberg’s special lighting affects
until the fourth or fifth viewing and
the musical score until the third view-
mg.

“I think that [the book and film]
make the Holocaust less deniable
than it was. All parties have to
remember that it happened,” Keneally
said.

Junior Steve Tender said bringing
Keneally to Pitt helps increase aware-
ness on c_ampus. “I have personal
feelings on the Holocaust, plus I have
visited Auschwitz. I think Holocaust
awareness is important on this cam-
pus.”

Freshman Lauren Hillman said the
lecture was very good and informa-
tive. “It was a chance to hear a differ-
ent point of view about the
Holocaust.”

For “Schind1er’s List,” Keneally
won the Booker Prize for Fiction and
the Los Angeles Times Prize for
Fiction.

Show ID

A man was arrested _in Trees Hall on Monday for carrying a
loaded gun and for trespassing on Pitt property. The man was not
carrying a Pitt ID, but like many people he had no problem getting
into Trees Hall. There is a large sign informing you, upon entering
Trees, that a valid Pitt ID is required. But IDing at Pitt facilities is
even worse than in the local bars. People are almost never asked for
ID upon entering Trees. Luckily, there have not been any serious
problems yet, but people carrying guns into Trees does not bode
well. Tempers have been known to ﬂare during a basketball game;
now bullets might ﬂy as well.

Trees Hall is not the only place where lack of ID has been a prob-
lem. Also on Monday, a shuttle driver had problems with some
individuals on the shuttle. It was then discovered that some people
on the shuttle carried no identiﬁcation.

How hard is it to ask for Pitt ID’s? Is it not the security officer at
Trees or the shuttle driver’s job to do so? Is this really so much to
ask? We pay for these services, and it is not fair to us to have other
people freeloading on us. Furthermore, with the potential for trou-
ble indicated by these recent incidents, it is insanity for the adminis-
tration not to do something to stop non-Pitt students from using
Trees, the shuttles or any other student services where ID is
required.

If a student were to get shot in Trees Hall because a security ofﬁ-
cer was too lazy to ask for identification, it would not only be a
tragedy, but would create serious liability problems for the universi-
ty. Not enforcing ID requirements is just plain stupid. The Pitt News
strongly urges the administration to right this wrong.

Willard brings Piil back

Pitt’s basketball team got waxed by North Carolina on Tuesday.
Although they played better than expected against the No. 2 team in
the country, it is very likely not the only ass—kicking the team is
going to get this year. But fear not Pitt students, new coach Ralph
Willard is going to bring the excitement back to Pitt students as well
as a contending team. .

This year is going to be a rebuilding and transition year for the
Panthers, but the style of play will be much more exciting than in
past years. Willard brings an up-tempo and three-point bombing
gameplan to Pitt. We may lose a lot this year, but the games will be
exciting, and we urge students to give the team their full support
and rock the house at our home games.

But while this season may be tough, that will soon change.
VVillard’s recruiting class has been ranked No. 2 in the nation by
USA Today. This in only his first season of recruiting. With the Big
East starting to again emerge as a power conference, the future
bodes well for Pitt basketball.

But part of a winning program is a strong home court advantage,
for which strong fan support is needed. Pitt has brought in a quality
coach, who is in turn bringing in a quality playing style and players.
It is our duty to rock the Field House and give them all the support
we can. Go Pitt!

SGB

On behalf of the 1994
Student Government Board,
I would like to offer some
comments on the recent
SGB article (“SGB strives
for the shortest meeting
ever”) of Nov. 29, 1994. It
appears that the reporter
coveringfthis ineeting, Eric
Smith (whose byline “For
The Pitt News” indicates he
has written less than five
stories), is in need of some
guidance concerning the dif-
ference between a news
story and an opinion editori-
al.

His criticism of the meet-
ing format is duly noted, but
it is really quite sad that the
absolute most important
information that SGB want-
ed to convey to the student
body — that concerning its
disagreement with the modi-
fied Block Plan options in
the Lothrop Convenience
Store — was placed at the
very end of the article, on
page 4. This is especially
ironic in light of both my
taking the time with this
new reporter to explain in
detail the situation at the
Lothrop Convenience Store
and The Pitt News Editorial
Board itself choosing to
write its own opinion editor-
ial supporting SGB’s posi-
tion.

A factor contributing to
the levity Mr. Smith experi-
enced was that the nine
elected officials in the meet-
ing will end their working
relationship very soon, and
their positive attitude
toward one another has
taken on a friendly, jesting
tone. Mr. Smith should
probably attend more uni-
versity meetings; perhaps he
would be surprised to note
that witty banter and laugh-
ter occurs at meetings of
other student groups, and

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

even the Senate Council.
However, I’ve yet to see the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette or
the University Times choose
to focus on this banter as the
lead in a news story.

The reasons for the
desired brevity of the meet-
ing are numerous. At this
time of the year, most stu-
dents are concentrating
heavily on preparing for
final exams and assign-
ments. Also, four of the
SGB personnel at the meet-
ing were in the middle of
completing eight hours of
allocations committee inter-
views, with the only break
being the SGB meeting
itself. This interviewing
team had an immediate
agenda after the meeting.

Finally, The Pitt News
readers should notice that a
serious gap exists between
the writing quality of a
reporter covering an SGB
meeting for the first time
and a team of nine elected
officials who have worked
together for a year. There is
nothing wrong with levity if
the most important infor-
mation conveyed to the
media in a timely and seri-
ous manner. The nine SGB
officials were elected by the
undergraduate student body
in the most competitive
election on record. It
appears that the requirement
for writing for the news sec-
tion of The Pitt News is a
pulse.

Ross Pasquale
President, SGB

BAS and Hillel

I am surprised that SGB
member Eric McKinley
could make such unfounded
remarks about the Jewish

students and faculty who are

active in Hillel. ‘He said that
to his “knowledge,” the only

tension between the
African-American/Jewish
community was felt by
Hillel, and not at all by the
Black Action Society. Mr.
McKinley’s “knowledge” is
just a mere bias. opinionated
and uninformed guess with a
short memory.

I am not a member of
either of these two groups,
but, I have felt and wit-
nessed the tension that Mr.
McKinley ignores. Last
year, the Black Action
Society made an all out
effort to deride The Pitt
News, simply because the
editors had Jewish looking
and sounding names.
Shortly afterwards, The Pitt
News scolded the BAS for
their racist policies, and the
BAS then boycotted The Pitt
“Jewish Controlled” News.
That doesn’t indicate ten-
sion? How about the old
constant barrage of letters
from the BAS that consis-
tently implicated the
Jewish community for their
problems, many times
equating Judaism with slav-
ery? Last year, the SGB
president even responded to
BAS with a letter saying
that blacks can also be
Jewish, as was so in his own
ancestry. Whenever the BAS
went on a “whine trip,”
directed against the Jewish
community, the more
responsible and socially eti-
quette Hillel responded with

offerings to discuss and‘

remedy whatever the current
problem BAS had with
them, which was often.

The Pitt News was correct
in saying that the “air”
needed to be cleared
between these organizations.
But Mr. McKinley, Hillel
wasn’t the group creating
the smoke.

of information about HIV and AIDS. It’s a
wonder how the most talked-about issue of the
‘90s was nearly nonexistent several years ago.

A while ago, a friend of mine told me that a
group of scientists discovered the HIV virus,
infected a few homosexuals, and failed to find a
cure before some bisexuals caught it. I seriously
question the likelihood of her story, although it is
true that prior to 1986 this disease was believed
to exist primarily among homosexuals, specifi-
cally gay men, and was even coined as the Gay
Man’s Syndrome.

The question is, why. did so few people know

The media bombards us every day with a slew

about it back then? AIDS was discovered in

1978, and the media put forth minimal effort in

 making known the existence of this very deadly

disease until 1986, when heterosexual occurrence
of AIDS first became frequent. The first reported

cases dated from 1979, but only in 1988 did the
media and government begin attacking this issue.
By then, however, reported cases had already
reached catastrophic numbers. Between 1981 and
1987, 50,000 cases were reported to the Center
for Disease Control. In 1988 alone, 124,174
cases of AIDS globally were reported to the
World Health Organization, with suspected unre-
ported cases numbering 300,000. The United
States accounted for 71 percent of the world
total.

Why did the American public only learn about
AIDS and HIV when it hit the heterosexual com-
munity? Was AIDS any less important when it
was considered the Gay Man’s Syndrome than it
is today? Most importantly, would AIDS be less
of a global epidemic threat if the public was more
knowledgeable about it in its first years?

It appears as if society took the position that as

The Pitt News, Thursday, December 1, 1994

Columnist questions why AIDS was ignored for so long

long as AIDS was contained within the “Gay
Community,” there was no reason to worry about
it. When people began contracting it through het-
erosexual contact however, the government went
out to warn the world with a kind of vigilance
seen only during wartime! So ultimately, our
equal rights, democratic government took it upon
themselves to play the role of “God” and decide
who is more worthy of their attention. Clearly,
the “heterosexual community” won that game by

far. But is a heterosexual any more worthy of_

treatment than a homosexual? As far as I know,
people do not receive medical care based on their
sexual preference.

Now, assuming that AIDS and HIV did remain
contained within the “Gay Community,” would it
be the huge uproar of the ‘90s that it is today?

Sonia Lander is a columnist for The Pitt News

BAS

The two articles that
appeared in the November
15 issue of‘The Pitt News
relating to the Jeannine
Amber lecture event were
examples of poor and
unprofessional journalism.
The article by Kevin

Kramer, “Speaker, SGB_

Help Relieve Racial
Tensions” is loaded with
incorrect information. The
article states that there are
“tensions between Pitt’s
Black Action Society and
Hillel.” This is absolutely
untrue. There is no known
proof of any dissension
between Hillel and BAS.
Jeannine Amber could not
have done anything to
“relieve” tensions between
BAS and Hillel because
there were no bad relations
apparent to begin with. You
cannot provide a solution to
a problem when there is no
problem in the first place. If
there are any bad feelings
from Hillel concerning the
Black Action Society, they
were not presented or made
known to BAS. In the future
I would advise The Pitt
News when reporting on
BAS to talk to the leader-
ship of the organization
first. / .

The article also said that
the “primary purpose” .of
the luncheon for Jeannine
Amber was to “clear the air
between BAS and Hillel.”
This certainly was not the
case. The Black Action
Society was given the
impression that the purpose
of the luncheon was to pro-
vide an opportunity for
members of the university
community to meet and talk
with Jeannine Amber.
Representatives of BAS
were surprised to discover
that the luncheon was a
group discussion about
issues relating to the
African American and
Jewish communities.

"Furthermore, the article by
Linda Wisniewski, “Amber
Speaks About Importance of
Cultural Diversity” also had
inaccuracies. The article
stated that the Jeannine
Amber lecture was a part of

the Black Action Society’s
Black, Week programs. This
was a mistake. The Jeannine
Amber lecture was not a
part of the Black Week pro-
grams, nor was BAS a co-
sponsor. I am very disap-
pointed that The Pitt News
would make such a big mis-
take especially since there
was little coverage of the
actual Black Week events.
The Black Action Society is

_ recognized by the university

as "the representative student
organization for black stu-
dents, and we are willing to
work with other groups to
uplift the entire black com-
munity.

Racism
After reading Mr. Barge’s

article (“Stephen Foster

Memorial and statue an
insult to blacks,” Nov. 7,
1994,) it seemed clear that
equality is an important
issue for him, as it should
be for every American. This
can be achieved through
complete integration of
black and white cultures and
the end of racially superior
attitudes in both communi-
ties. We must change our
attitudes toward blacks" and
whites. We should not
expect the media or univer-
sity to take on this task for
us — this is our responsibil-
ity. The media is a reflection
of the current attitudes with-
in our culture. How can we
expect them to change if we
don’t? '

As for the issue of the
African Cultural Center,
regardless of who it is
designed to represent, a cul-
tural center says in effect:
“Be proud you are this
race,” thereby defining indi-
viduals foremost according
to race. How can racism end
as long as we continue this
blatant labeling based on
skin color?

We must stop pointing the
finger at the media, the uni-
versity and everyone else,
and start accepting responsi-
bility for the ideas and
racial stereotypes that we

continue to keep alive in our
hearts.

Recycling

The coalition of students
that has formed around the
recycling issue is nothing
short of impressive. CWO,
RSA, Circle K, SEAC and
even the National Wildlife
Federation, as well as other
campuses around Pittsburgh
like CMU and Carlow, have
all united to help Pitt devel-
op a-comprehensive recy-

cling program on campus. .

We are very ‘happy that
Housing is willing to work
with us in this critical inat-
ter. ‘ ”"

It is no secret that recy-
cling on Pitt’s campusis not
the very best it could be.
However, the fault is ‘not
entirely with the administra-
tion, nor does the entire
solution lie in designing an
effective system for collect-
ing and separating recy-
clable materials. The
biggest challenge lies in
educating the campus com-
munity about the need for
recycling, and even relearn-
ing how to dispose of that
soda you are sipping from
right now. We as a campus
need to make some simple
yet fundamental changes in
the way we live our lives.
These changes can best
come about through cooper-
ation and community’ effort.
SEAC, CWO, RSA, Circle
K and the other organiza-
tions have joined with the
Housing Administration to
take the first step, towards
making those changes. But
we cannot do it alone. It
will involve each and every
student, staff and faculty
member to make this new
and improved recycling pro-
gram work.

Dickensheets wrong

Mr. Dickensheets’ grasp
of the problems of “blacks
and other minorities in an
inner-city underclass” is
presumptuous and blatantly
oversimplified. If he would

LETTERS To THE EDITOR /

stop the dittohead hyperbole
and open his eyes to the
struggles of others, perhaps
he would glean something
of the complexities of the
human condition. But Mr.
Dickensheets can only see
the poor as some abstract
entity that lurks at the very
fringe of his world, lawless,
lazy beings trying to break
the barrier and get some-
thing they don’t deserve.
The talented ones, born into
families that can afford the
necessities of life, must
keep a constant vigil against
those who try to sneak into
the fold. The truth is the
welfare system could be
abolished tomorrow and the
financial burden to the tax-
payers would be impercepti-

bly affected.
Unquestionably, the welfare
system needs to be

reformed. But the same
could be said for the
Defense Department, and
that is not met with as much
enthusiasm. It just bugs Mr.
Dickensheets that someone
may get something for noth-
ing when, undoubtedly, he
never took a helping hand in
his life. Funny, when the
subject of welfare comes up,
the self—made men come out
of the’ woodwork.
Remember, beware the self-
made man who worships his
creator.

Andrea Campbell

WPTS

I

This letter is concerning
the article “Subtle subver-
sion” which explains the
reason behind the cancelling
of WPTS-sponsored shows.
I understand the basic
premise for the cancella-
tions of the shows is
because an American flag
the size of one’s hand was
set on fire at the Rancid
show. I attended the Rancid
show, yet didn’t hear of the
flag-burning incident until a
couple weeks later. How is
it that I was at the show and
didn’t notice such a devious
act you may wonder? Well,
the reason was the incident
was an isolated event which
didn’t really affect a soul at
the show. The woman who

set the flag on fire wasn’tar

Pitt student nor even a
Pennsylvania resident for
that matter, yet because of
her we can’t see cool bands
play anymore. Now also
cited in the article for the
ban was a show
occurred last year which I
also attended. At this show
someone vomited in the
men’s bathroom, once again
not a Pitt student but an out-
sider.

Being a college student, I
don’t have the funds to go
pay $12.50 to go see a band
play at venues such as
Graffiti or Metropol. This is
where WPTS comes into
play. WPTS provides shows
featuring bands, such as
Rancid, who will go on to
play only larger clubs, with
higher ticket prices, as their
popularity grows. Also, you
don’t have to be 21 years
old to get into a WPTS
show, whereas at places like
the Decade and Bloomfield
Bridge Tavern you do. The
only way for people under
21 to see good underground
shows in Pittsburgh is
through WPTS, as no one
else besides bars can bring
in such acts. It is because of
this that I plead for the
return of shows provided by
WPTS and, if not, thank
them for the healthy enter-
tainment they gave to me
and my friends in my first
year and a half at Pitt.

Although I know this sub-
ject doesn’t pertain to
everyone, but imagine if
you will that all football or
basketball games were can-
celled. Imagine the uproar it
would cause. Just because
the number of people who
attend these shows is a
minority at Pitt doesn’t
mean that our forms of
entertainment should be
banished. To us these shows
mean a lot, they are equiva-
lent to what a football or
basketball game means to a
loyal Panther fan. Maybe
I’m wrong, but I just think
all students should have
equal representation when it
comes to university policies.

Fifty Million Frenchmen

Music/Lyrics: Cole Porter

Direction and Choreography: Ted
Pappas

Pittsburgh Public Theater

Through Dec. 18

Tickets: 321-9800

Ask anyone who really knows me, i
love Jazz. its heat, speed and syn-
chronicity separate it from all other
forms of music. Fifty Mil/ion
Frenchmen is Jazz, played out with
people instead of instruments. The tim-
ing was clean, the pace was fast and
the subject, desire, couldn’t have been
hotter for the period when it was writ-
ten. This revival of the 1929 original
was pure energy, and damn good.

This production stands by the origi-
nal script as adapted by Evans Haile
and Tommy Krasker, and making a 65-
year-old play relate to a ‘90s audience
is not an easy thing, but the themes
are so timeless it still works. Andrew
Lloyd Webber, a definitive example of
modern composers, is wonderfully suc-
cessful in marketing his plays to the
public, but his musicals are somewhat
formulaic. There is a serious need to
look back at our past in order to move
the musical art form into the future.
The composition is what makes a
musical great, and unlike a Webber
musical, this production never buries
the orchestra. instead, the five-piece
orchestra is on stage the entire time,
giving the score of the musical the
attention it deserves.

Peter Forbes (Don Goodspeed) is
young, rich and hot for a Midwest
beauty, Looloo (Melodie Wolford), he
scoped out on the boat to Paris. He
makes a bet with Billy (Peter Rearden)

that he can convince
her to marry him with-
out his money. Our
hero finds himself
penniless on the
streets of Paris, while
Billy puts the moves
on Looloo. Picking up
Mcjobs as a tour
guide and a “dancing
man,” he sends his
trusting but material
love flowers to tide
her over until the
fourth of July, when
he can reveal his true
identity. While he
spends his days pro-
viding shock value to
indifferent Americans,
he loses her money
and her trust, yet he
never manages to
lose her heart.

lt’s a plot straight
out of the golden age
of musicals. Yet its
lyrics from numbers
like “You’ve Got That
Thing” and percussion of “Let’s Step
Out” caused a huge scandal that gave
the production an experimental edge
over its contemporaries.

Goodspeed’s dominating presence
and powerful vocals stand out in his
performance of Peter, a character
whose lines could otherwise be viewed
as too dated or plastic. His seduction
in “You Do Something To Me,” the
most famous of the musica|’s numbers,

language were polished, and “Please
Don’t make Me Be Good” exemplified
the sexual awakening of the 1920s.

The quality of the female vocals
overall was strong, but Liz
McCartney’s demanding chanteuse,
May, proved the widest range and dis-
played beautiful tonality in numbers
like “Find Me a Primitive Man” and “l’m
Unlucky At Gambling.” For vocalholics,
she’s the reason to see this play.

The set has a sleek feel to it to
appease the modern audience, and so
does the simple choreography, but the
costumes are as outrageous as the
1920s would allow. They are beautiful,

beautiful, beautiful — no, other way to
describe them.

Fifty Million Frenchmen is full of the
uninhibited sexual tension that was so
much a part of the ‘20s Paris scene,
and of Jazz itself. lt’s rare to find a
medium that captures that with such a
sense of humor. Pittsburgh Public
Theater, in this landmark production,
does that for me, and hopefully sets a
benchmark for area revivals to come.

The performance runs at the
Pittsburgh Public Theater on the North

Death and Disaster: The
Rise of the Warhol Empire
and the Race for Andy's
Millions

by Paul Alexander

Villard Books 258 pps.

Andy Warhol’s legacy is
everywhere, from the populari-
ty of his art to his enduring
attitude of everyone’s 15 min-
utes of fame. Pop art and par-
ties go hand-in-hand with
Warhol, and Pittsburgh,
Warhol’s hometown, has
become one of the most
important areas of the man’s
continuing importance to the
art world with the opening of
the Warhol Museum this year
on the North Side.

Yet behind the famous per-
sona of Andy is a multi-million
dollar fortune left in a state of
flux after the artist’s death. In
Paul Alexander's book, Death
and Disaster, it is revealed
that since Warhol’s death in
1987 and the creation of the
Warhol Foundation, millions of
dollars have been misman-
aged, antiques misplaced and
one of the most important men
in Warhol’s life reduced to a
sideline player. Alexander's
book, separated into two parts
-- Warhol’s life and the activi-
ties surrounding his fortune
after his death —— outlines in
detail the business move-
ments and the fight for the
worth of the artist.

Fred Hughes, Warhol’s busi-
ness associate since the
1960s, was given the charge
of managing the artist’s for-
tune after his death and estab-
lishing the Andy Warhol
Foundation for the Visual Arts,

  

o" . "
I

a non-profit organization that
would give grants to artists,
feeding off the millions in
assets accumulated over the
years. With unsold art,
antiques that Warhol hoarded
and property assets, the worth
of the estate and the founda-
tion was estimated in the hun-
dreds of millions. But now, not
even 10 years after Warhol’s
death, money has become so
tight that the Foundation has
the possibility of losing control
of the day-to-day operation of
the Andy Warhol Museum
because of lack of finances.
Millions of dollars seem to be
missing, and the money given
out of the fund has barely
reached the acceptable level
for the Foundation to remain a
non-profit organization. Fred
Hughes, meanwhile, has been
reduced to a sideline player,
no longer involved directly with
the Foundation.

The book, meticulous in its
details regarding the financial
side of the foundation, puts
the blame on various people
who now control the
Foundation yet were never
involved with Warhol’s work,
or art in general before. A
common comment throughout
the text is, “Andy wouldn't
have  and in most cases, it
seems to be the truth.

Paul Alexander, who wrote
in The Village Voice and New
York Magazine of the
Foundation during its forma-
tive and troubling years,
seems to understand well
where the troubles lay in the
Warhol Foundation, and he
writes clearly and thoroughly
about them. Although some-

 

.,.

  

times his bias becomes too
obvious, the reader is able to
ascertain on their own who is
right and wrong in the con-
flicts. lf there is any problems
in the book, it is in the fact that
Alexander talks too much of
Warhol’s artistic and personal
life (over one-third of the book)
and possibly not enough of the
business side of the man.

Death and Disaster is a
complete investigation into the
differences between art and
money — the creativity of the
individual artist against the
bureaucracy of the business
world.

The Tragical Comedy or
Comic Tragedy of Mr. Punch
by Neil Gaiman and Dave
McKean '

Vertigo/DC Comics, 24.95

For several years, the press
has tried to bring comics into
the ‘90s with such catchy
phrases as “Comics grow up”
and “Comics aren’t just for
kids anymore,” and, to a point,
that’s true. More graphic vio-
lence and sex certainly consti-
tute a more adult ‘stance, but
they don’t necessarily mean a
more mature story. For‘ the
most part, comic books remain
a male fantasy with scantily
clad, large-breasted women
and a general power fix, not
the high art that many try to
make it into.

There are exceptions, of
course, and no better excep-
tions than Chester Brown’s I
Never Liked You and Neil
Gaiman and Dave McKean’s
Mr. Punch. Both use a less
traditional medium, words and
pictures, to tell stories; stories
without costumes, without
super-powers, and with, most
importantly, emotion.

/ Never Liked You is an
autobiographical tale by
Chester Brown that centers
around his teen years and his
acceptance and rejection of
friends and farrfily. The story
illustrates his connection to
his clinically depressed moth-
er (a depression that eventu-
ally leads to her death), his
classmates who ridicule him
for his lack of use of profanity
and his infatuation with a girl
that leads to nothing. Brown
shows his relationship with his
own feelings and his inability
to relay them when they are
most important, and he does
so in a unique, yet realistic,
fashion.

What Brown does best is to
use the medium of words and
pictures to its fullest, creating
a pace unavailable in prose or
film. Here, Brown can fill a
page with seven panels or just
one, and he has control of the
characters and action like any
film director would dream of.
His art and dialogue are sim-
ple and sparse, yet that only
adds to the charm and impor-
tance of the story.

. I Never Liked You is at
times painfully true and realis-
tic, and Chester Brown has
become one of the most
important cartoonists today.

Neil Gaiman (writer) and
Dave McKean (art and
design) produce a slightly
more traditional story with Mr.
Punch. Set mostly in 70’s
England, Mr. Punch involves
a young boy, his grandfather
and the death of the Punch

and Ju y show, a violent pup-
pet show that, frightening as
the premise seems, was pop-
ular entertainment for children
for hundreds of years. The
Punch and Judy story tells of
a man, Punch, who kills Judy,
a baby, a doctor, a judge and
eventually the Devil himself.
Set around this backdrop, the
boy must look more closely
into the world of his grandfa-
ther, a confused role model at
best, and into the change of
his maturing mind.

Gaiman’s words are insight-
ful and true, and he combines
the innocence of the boy with
a more mature narrator. The
dialogue is clear and precise,
and the story falls into some-
thing that connects the simple
ways of childhood and the ter-
rifying aspect of the Punch
and Judy show and the gruff,
dislocated grandfather.

McKean’s visuals, a combi-
nation of pen and ink, pho-
tographs, collage and water-
colors, are, like the story, in a
constant emotional connec-
tion. Scenes are played out
from the view of a frightened
child, and he never overplays
the story. In Mr. Punch, the art
and story do what is most
important in comics, comple-
ment each other, a piece of
work in which the complete
package is noteworthy.

What is mature and what is
worthwhile are points of con-
trast in any medium, but in
something such as comic
books, immature by nature, it
is refreshing to see something
that can stand out not only in
words and pictures, but in
anything. I Never Liked You
and Mr. Punch shows what
good storytelling can do,
notable works using a medi-
um connected more with
ducks and mice than with
mind and meaning.

Gets New

Bringing the biz to the ‘burgh is
nothing new for the Pittsburgh Film
Office. Lorenzo’s Oil, Silence of the
Lambs, Hoffa, Only You, Bob Roberts
and now Sudden Death. in four years
the Film Office has assisted in the pro-
duction of 40 feature and television
films, as well as commercials, music
videos and industrial film projects —
which have generated $125 million in
revenue for the Pittsburgh region.

In October, Dawn Keezer left her
position in Santa Cruz, Ca|if., as direc-
tor of public affairs and film commision-
er and is now the director of
Pittsburgh’s Film Office. She replaces
former director Robert Curran, who left
Pittsburgh to accept a position with
MGM Television. While in Santa Cruz,
Keezer was responsible for develop-
ment of the county’s media relations,
film and community relations program.
Before leaving for Pittsburgh, she had
tripled the county’s film revenue.

“Economic development is what the
Film Office is really all about — bring-
ing in people that are going to spend a
lot of money and create new jobs,”
Keezer said.

As director of the film office, Keezer
will be responsible for marketing
Pittsburgh to television and film studios
so that more production will take place
here. At her position in Santa Cruz,
Keezer said she used direct mail cam-
paigns in which photos of the county

 

were sent out to studio executives so
that they could evaluate Santa Cruz as
a possible set location.

She said Pittsburgh will also be mar-
keted in this manner. “|t’s a great place
to shoot. There’s diversity of locations
in a very small space. There’s down-
town, and then drive a very short dis-
tance and be in farmland. There’s so
much here for them to shoot, and
there’s a great crew base,” she said.

Although Santa Cruz had the beach,
the only operating amusement park on
the West Coast (where parts of “The
Lost Boys” were shot), nearby moun-
tains and Redwood trees, Keezer said
Pittsburgh has more varied locations
than her former city. That is why pro-
duction executives have found
Pittsburgh such an appealing location
to shoot in recent years. Pittsburgh’s
strong crew base “that are very capa-
ble, trained and well-known in the
industry” also appeal to production
managers and location scouts.

For most feature films, studios
review thousands of scripts before a
few are chosen to be made into
movies. Studios look for scripts that will
appeal to a broad-based audience, and
when about 100 have been consid-
ered, the studios will budget each, they
begin thinking about potential stars and
narrow the scripts down. “They are
looking at money,” Keezer said. “The
money is always the bottom line in

tryside and other more unique settings

“Basically,” she said, “we wine and
dinehim for a weekend and really
show him what Pittsburgh has to offer.”
And although Pittsburgh may not be
used for a script immediately following
a trip, years from now the producer will
remember the city, she said.

“l’ve been fortunate that l’ve been a
film commissioner for five-and-a-half
years now. So, l’ve had the opportunity

hoping to bring those relationships to

Keezer said. Hollywood executives
change positions often in Los Angeles,
and Keezer’s familiarization with
numerous producers and her connec-
tions are very important in bringing pro-
duction to Pittsburgh because, she
said, “people buy from people they
know. That’s true whether or not your
selling washing machines or cars, or
whatever."

notice there isn’t a female
counterpart to the word
“misogyny”?) It's cool that
Pavement plays with different
tunings, but has anyone
noticed that Liz does it too?
Didn’t think so.

Of course you can’t expect
such understanding from the
same mainstream journalists
who dream up idiotic phrases
like “do—me feminists,” to
describe such women who
enjoy sex; as if most feminists
didn’t dig copulation until

lyrics like ‘‘I want to be your
blowjob queen,” the album
starts off with a brief tale of a
one-night stand that never
happens because Liz says,
“l’m timid.” lt’s OK boys, she

While Exile felt like more of a

Midnight film-
Basic Instinct

 

piano exercise Phair plays soft-
ly on the 88s, accompanied by
some guitar noise off in the dis-
tance.

Subtle changes in recording
quality provide variety from
track to track and emphasize
the moods of the songs. The
two most divergent tracks
appear side by side. On
“Shane,” the drums have a
bedroom recording sound,
while the guitar and vocals
sound crisp. Liz strums away
and sings in a low and thereby
menacing voice. It gradually
builds to a climax as she sings,
“You gotta have fear in your
heart” over and over, as if she
won’t stop until she installs the
fear personally. As Phair
repeats the mantra, a flood of
television noise engulfs the
song.

“Nashville” follows, with as
much bliss as its predecessor
had menace. This romantic
slow dance features a Cocteau

Twins guitar as well as saxo-‘

phone and harmony vocals.
Instead of sounding gravelly
again, our heroine sings at the
top of her register, giving off
some warm, heartfelt sincerity.

Whip-Smart includes a cou-
ple more user-friendly pop
gems. The title cut’s beat box
driven groove sounds perfect
for those nice “alternative” pro-
gramming shows. The rocked
out “Supernova” delivers some
chunky riffage and a driving
chorus. Yet the guts and idio-
syncracies in these songs
make sure they’ll never get
mistaken for standard radio
fodder, “alternative” or ‘mersh
(that’s commercial to you).

If any criticism can be lobbed
atWhip-Smart, it stems from
the fact that the strongest
material comes in the first half
of the album. Not that Phair
runs out of ideas by the time

Unplugged in New York
Nirvana
DGC

OK, I admit it. i only started
listening to Nirvana after Kurt
Cobain blew his own head off
with a shotgun last April. I
didn’t like Nirvana because
they were too popular. For
God’s sake 14-year-old kids
were singing the slurred lyrics
to “Smells Like Teen Spirit.” I
didn’t want to be a part of that
scene. But when i heard about
Cobain’s suicide, l was totally
floored. For some strange rea-
son, I felt like I had lost a
fnend.

I broke my solemn vow
never to buy a Nirvana album
with the purchase of
Nevermind, Nirvana’s “break-
through” album that sent the
kids through the roof.
Thoroughly entranced with its
brimming bar chords and over-
loaded distortion, I bought
Bleach and In Utero to to\sat-
isfy my new addiction. I’m now
convinced of Cobain’s incredi-
ble musical abilities.

Listening to Unplugged in it

New York gave me a sort of
.queazy feeling. Not that the
music was bad, but there was
not a single word mentioning
Cobain and the contribution he
made to the music world.
Nada, nuthin’, zilch. At least
the words “ln memory of Kurt
Cobain” could have been print-

After getting over this dis-
heartening discovery, l sank
into all of the songs. Recorded
last Nov. 18, such classic
songs as “Come as You Are”
and “On a Plain” may have
had the volume turned down,
but the emotion was turned up
past 10. Cobain relied on his
voice as an instrument as
much as he did his guitar. The
crackle of his voice splintered
into a raspy holler on “All
Apologies.” Anguish was tat-
tooed all over his greasy-
blonde head.

The meat of this album lies
in the cover tunes. “Jesus
Doesn’t Want Me for a
Sunbeam” is an old Christian
song replumbed to give a sar-
castic flavor. Krist Novose|ic’s
sloppy accordion playing adds
a folk-like feel to the song. is it
possible to play the accordion
neatly? Cobain’s singing hits a
groove that made me sing
along to the chorus: “Don’t
expect me to cry/ Don’t expect
me to lie/ Don’t expect me to
die.” “The Man Who Sold the
World” almost sounded
impromptu with Cobain admit-
ting that he might “screw a
part of it up.” His distorted
acoustic guitar put that signa-
ture grunge edge to this old
David Bowie song.

What unplugged album
would be complete without a
cello player? Not this one. The
warm tones generated from
the cello filled the rests
between:Cobain’s straining
voice in the songs “Dumb” and
“Polly.” A lingering mellowness
is radiated through the album,

Under new
guidance,
track and
field comes
together

n recent

years, the

Panthers
have had a
facelift so to
speak, as var-

 

ious teams

went through
Columnist coaching
Keith changes.
Pompey Despite what

you might

think, it was the men’s track
and field team that suffered
the most.

Under former coach John
Vasvary, who resigned during
the summer, track and field
members were filled with bro-
ken promises.

“He promised us clothing,
and we would never get
them,” said Jay Murphy. “Last

. year, he
told us
he was
going to
get us
new
warm-
ups.

7 Have
you seen us with them? And
we had to beg him for the
body suits.”

In the midst of arguing for
uniforms, the team divided.
The sprinters and throwers
went one way, while the dis-
tance runners went the other.

Things got so bad that, last
year at the Big East Indoor
Track and Field Champion-
ship, some runners didn’t even
know one another.

This Saturday at West
Vlfczinia University, the
Panthers will be guided by a’
new coach, Steve Lewis.

Before this year, Lewis was
the head coach of the women’s
program, as well as the men’s
sprint coach.

During his tenure at Pitt, he
has produced over 70 Big East
champions, 13 individual All-
Americans, several additional
All-American relays squads
and two world—record holders.

When Pitt won the confer-
ence outdoor crown, it was
Lewis, not Vasvary who got
the credit.

Under his tutelage, look for
the Panthers to compete more
as a team this year, not like a
group of individuals.

“Things seem a lot better
this year,” Murphy said. “Last
year it seemed like the team
was going in two different
directions. There is a lot more
camaraderie and leadership
amongst the captains. This
year, everybody seems a lot

Women's h

By Brett Fondrk
Staff Writer

After spending a long week-
end in Nevada, the Pitt Lady
Panthers finally came home to
take a short jaunt down Fifth
Avenue to play Crosstown rival
Duquesne. If they were suffer-
ing any jet lag, it wasn’t evident
on the court last night, as they
defeated the Lady Dukes 74-71
at the A]. Palumbo Center.

Senior point guard Carol
Morton led the Lady Panthers
as she scored 17 points and
dished out seven assists.

On the receiving end of most
of her passes was freshman cen-
ter Latia Howard, who scored
10 points, and pulled down a
team-high 12 boards.

The inside-outside combina-
tion of Morton and Howard
proved to be too much for
Duquesne as Pitt improved to 2-
1.

“It was Carol’s best all-
around game,” coach Kirk
Bruce said. “They left her open,
and she hit some critical shots.
She had a tremendous game for
a point guard.” 3

Bruce also pointed out that
Howard’s big game was helped
out by Morton’s stellar perfor-
mance.

“Latia was a little nervous
early in the game, but she came

back to make some big plays,”

he said.

“She was five for nine from
the field. Carol got her the ball
where she just had to turn and
shoot.”

Pitt led 36-32 at the half, and
had a lead that ballooned to as
high as 12 in the second half, as
the Lady Panthers survived a
late Duquesne run.

Wrestling confidentwith tough schedule

Pitt News File Photo

Carol Morton scored a team-high 17 points last night.

“They shot themselves back
in the game,” he said. “They
made a couple of late runs, but
we were able to weather the
storm.” .

Pitt had a balanced scoring
attack, with all five starters in
double figures. The Lady Dukes
were led by Korie Hlede, who
poured in 21 points and nine
rebounds. Hlede essentially kept
the Lady Dukes in the game in
the second half when Pitt
appeared poised to make the
game a rout.

By Adam Pincus
Staff Writer

With an extremely chal-
lenging schedule ahead this
year, the Pitt wrestling team
will look to make its mark
against some of the nation’s
top competition.

“We beefed up our sched-
ule,” said head coach Rande
Stottlemeyer in the team’s
media guide. “We added

some of the top teams in the

country, so we can see where
we compare on the national
level.”

Some of those teams that
Pitt will face are Penn State,
Iowa State, Purdue, Ohio
State, Clarion, Lock Haven,
Edinboro, West Virginia and
Bloomsburg. Each of these
teams finished last season
ranked in the top 40.

“I think in order to be the
best you have to wrestle the
best,” said junior Brett
Gould. “You can’t gear your-
self up to wrestle the better
guys at the end of the year
unless you’ve done it all year
long.

,. \\._. .

“It was a good, close game,”
Bruce said. “We played a con-
sistent game and were able to
avoid a let-down.”

Pitt will have no. time for a
let-down Sunday, or they will
be the one on the short end of a
rout. Penn State will be coming
to town and bringing with them
a top 10 ranking.

“They’re loaded, they are just
as good as their ranking,” he
said. “We’re just gonna play
hard and see how the chips
fall.” .

West
heads
Big East
football
honors

Pitt running back Billy
West was named the Big
East Offensive Player of
the Year yesterday.

Voted on by the eight
conference coaches,
West, a sophomore, was
also unanimously select-
ed as a first-team All-
Big East performer for
his league-leading 1,358
yards, which ranked
ninth in the nation.

Senior offensive tack-
le Reuben Brown, earli-
er named as an All-
American, was also
unanimously voted first-
team All—Big East.

Senior receiver Billy

A Davis’. 51 receptions and

conference-leading nine
touchdown receptions
landed him on the sec-
ond team.

For the second con-
secutive season Tom
Barndt earned second-
team honors. Barndt, a
senior defensive tackle,
collected eight sacks.

Miami's defensive
tackle Warren Sapp was
named the Defensive
Player of the Year.

— Sean Duncan

Heavyweight Pat Wiltanger has All-America potential.

“Out of all of our other
regular dual meets, I think
we will be in every match,”
said Gould. “I don’t see

where we are wrestling a
team that is that much above
us where we couldn’t-com-
pete with them.”

Gurus round our college basketball top 25 preview

The Pitt News

(Editor's Note: This is the second
of a two-part series continued

from Tuesday.)

17 .) Georgetown

Coach John Thompson’s lum-
bering, stuff—’em—down-your-
throat style of play might be
altered by the arrival of the top
freshman point guard Allen
Iverson. Iverson scored 30 points
a game as a junior in high school
before he spent most of his
senior year in jail due to a brawl
in a bowling alley.

But the thrust of the Hoyas’
offense is still centered around 6-
10 junior Othella Harrington
who averaged 14.7 points and
eight boards.

Blue—chip big man Jahidi
White should alleviate some of
Harrington’s responsibilities.
Guard George Butler is the only
other returning double-digit scor-
er.

18.) Wisconsin

Michael Finley is one of the
most prolific scorers in the
nation. The 6-7 forward does it
all — especially jump, evident
from the backboard—shattering
dunk he displayed this summer.

Sophomore big man Rashard
Griffith decided to stay a Badger
after he originally left the team at
season's end — and with his 7-1
presense, Wisconsin is a top con-
tender for the Big Ten title.

19.) Alabama

Pitt can kick itself for the one
that got away. After originally
committing to the Panthers,
Jamal Faulkner bolted to
Arizona State after serving a year
at prep school (which someone
afﬁliated with Pitt paid for, and
then he ratted on Pitt for recruit-
ing violations). Then Faulkner
got kicked out of ASU for a
phone scandal. Now he’s at
‘Bama and making serious noise,
and it ain’t with the phone.

Besides Faulkner, the Tide
have the other four starters back

who all averagedtdouble-digits
from last year’s 20- 10 squad.

20.) Memphis

What happened to the State in
Memphis? Anyway, the
Memphis kids have all grown up
— at the least a year older, which
should be plenty.

Junior David Vaughn led the
Tigers last year in both scoring
and rebounding, averaging 12
per game. Vaughn was lonely on
the blocks a year ago. Now he’s
joined by 6-10 high school All-
American Lorenzen Wright. One
guy who seems to have matured
over the summer is sophomore
forward Cedric Henderson.
Henderson cuts straight to the
goal, slips underneath for his
share of boards and plays tough
D’.

The backcourt lost Johnny
Miller and Sidney Coles to trans-

fers, but it returns lead guard '

Chris Garner and erratic yet dan-

gerous shooter Deuce Ford.‘

21.) Oklahoma State

The Cowboys lost some fire
power to graduation, but retain
Big Rural (the other name is now
a cliche) Bryant Reeves.

The Big Eight title could boil
down to the head-to—head wars
between Reeves and Kansas’
Ostertag. You can see the nuts
and bolts ﬂying already.

Oklahoma State has more than
Reeves, however. Randy
Rutherford is back at two-guard,
and Chianti Roberts is ready to
star at small forward. But the
Cowboys desperately need a
point guard and somebody to
help Reeves grab rebounds.

22.) Villanova

‘Nova is more than ready to
graduate from NIT champ to
NCAA qualiﬁer. The core of the
team is now juniors and sopho-
mores, Kerry Kittles is able to
hoist the VVildcats fortunes on his
back in the waning moments and
all ﬁve starters return.

Kittles is as good as it gets in
the Big East. Center Jason
Lawson now has a tour of duty
under his belt and will be asked
to carry more of a load this time.
Eric Eberz shoots well from the
perimeter, Jonathan Haynes
plays ball-hawking defense and
6-4 Alvin Williams is a rising
star off the bench.

The missing link last year was
a dominant power forward.
Villanova solved that by having
6-9 N.C. State transfer Charles
Komegay join the ranks.

23.) Michigan State
Gunner Shawn Respert is back
with his 24.3 point average.
Respert, viewed by many as the
top shooting guard, is on the
verge of breaking Steve Smith’s
school scoring record and could
possibly break the Big Ten scor-
ing record held by Calbert
Cheaney. But unlike past years,
he ﬁnally has a team around him.
I Ultra—quick point guard Eric
Snow will team up with Respert

will be facing. The team
opened its season by travel-
ling to Lock Haven
University for the Mat-Town
USA Invitational.

The Panthers placed fourth
out of 13 teams. Penn State
won the tournament with 126
points, Nebraska got the sec-
ond spot with 120 points and
Lock Haven squeezed its
way into third with 113
points, two points above
Pitt’s 111.

The team’s projected
starters each placed well at
L o c k
Haven,
with the
excep-
tion of
t . h e
heavy-
weight
division, due to the absence
of junior Pat Witlanger.

“We were only 15 points
away from the first—place
team, and 15 points is easily
scoreable with Pat Wiltanger
in the lineup,” Gould said.
“We did not score very many
points at 158 or 177, and
none at heavyweight. So
basically, if we had scored in
those three weight classes,

fleet

"Let us nqtgrow weary while doing
good, qr in cfue season we 5 reap
A if we do not [we art.

then that is an easy 20
points, and we could have
been in the hunt for first
place.”

Junior J.J. Fasnacht,
wrestling in the l42—pound
class, is looking to repeat his
impressive total of 33 wins
last season, which ranks as
the second-best sophomore
season in Pitt history. He
continued his winning ways
at Lock Haven with a first-
place finish.

Junior standout John
Richey is at the 134 class.
Richey advanced to his sec-
ond—straight NCAA
Championship last year and
took second place this week-
end at Mat-Town.

Brett Gould will start at
150, which is considered to
be the most competitive
weight class on the team.
Gould placed third last
weekend.

Pat Wiltlanger is at the
heavyweight spot and has the
potential to earn All-
America honors. He is com-
ing off of a knee injury and
has not competed yet this
season.

Bryan Matusic will be at
the 167 slot, as he opened up
the year with a second-place

finish at Lock Haven. He
lost the title match, 2-1, to
Penn State’s Glen Pritzlaff in
overtime.

Opening up at the 118 spot
is sophomore Chris Stevens,
who had some big wins as a
freshman. He will be count-
ed on to set the pace for the
team.

Freshman Chad Jesko
started last weekend’s match
for the Panthers at the 126
spot and was able to earn
himself a fifth-place finish.

Fifth-year senior Derek
Burgert will be at the 158
spot.

Burgert has wrestled 167
and 177 classes in the past.
He will be looked upon to be
a leader for this year’s
squad.

Junior John Gibeaut is at
177 slot and saw limited
action last year after earning
a starting role during his
freshman campaign.

At 190 is freshman Mark
Bodo, who redshirted last
year in order to mature phys-
ically.

“Preseason rankings came
out, and we were ranked
37th,” Brian Matusic said.
“Personally, I think we are a
much better team than that.”

24.) Illinois

The best thing the Illini could
have done to cure their under-
achieving plague was to fire
coach Lou Henson, but that
didn’t happen. They may have
found the next best answer, how-
ever, by landing big—time recruit
Jerry Gee. Gee, a 6-7 power-
finesse forward, covers every
aspect of the game and will
immediately make an impact.

Illinois’ attack is led by sopho-
more point man Kiwane Garris ,
who causes havoc on offense and
defense. If center Shelly Clark
sheds some pounds and stays
away from the police, then the
Illini could be the sleeper in the
Big Ten.

25.) Ohio University

Gary Trent —— that’s all you
need to know. The 6-7 all-every-
thing forward scored 25.4 points
and collected 11 boards a game
last year. And by the way, he has
a 43-inch vertical jump. Tiny
Gino Ford’s three—point arsenal
will allow Trent to build on last
year’s numbers.

“Coach Vas[vary] 
not that he didn’t care
about us, he just lost the
love for the sport. He just
wasn’t into it. He didn’t
love it like everybody
else. Lewis is much more
dependable. You know
with him you are going to
get things done.”

Distance captain Mike
Umbleby added, “It is a
lot cooler. It was kind of
hard last year when you
had a race coming up and
you didn’t know your

This year, Lewis has
instilled team together-

Under new guidance,
Pitt should finish with in
