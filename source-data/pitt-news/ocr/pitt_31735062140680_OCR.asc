Plans Naval

University of  2658 Volume 33 Number 23  

Both the army and navy ﬂying
corps will display the blue and gold
colors of Pitt when a ﬂying cadet
naval unit is formed at the Uni-
versity, correlating almost exactly
the University ﬂying cadet army
unit organized last year. v

To form this Pitt unit in the Na-
val Aviation corps, Ensign Ralph
Cox, D35, will discuss cadet train-
ing, interview applicants, and show
pictures of naval cadet camp life
at 3 o’clock in 208 Cathedral to-
day.

Students who are accepted may
ﬁnish their school year before be-
ginning training.

The requirements, commissions,
and pay are practically identical to
those of the army ﬂying cadets.

Applicants should be between
the ages of 20 and 27, unmarried,
should have the equivalent of two
years college credits, and should
be morally, physically, and psy-
chologically up to the Navy stand-
ards.

They will agree to remain on
active duty for four years after be-
ing commissioned, and will agree
to remain unmarried for two years
after beginning active duty.

Upon completing a six weeks
training course and the six months
advance course, the cadets will be
commissioned as ensigns in the
naval reserve,» or second lieuten-
ants in the Marine corps reserve
and will be sent to active duty in
the Aeronautic Organization of the
US Navy.

During the training period the
cadets will be paid $75 a _month
plus an extra $30 for expenses. As
ensigns they will receive $245 a.
month.

A ROTC men will be able to apply

for the naval ﬂying cadets by ﬁrst 

effecting a separation from the
University corps.

Cox received his commission
two and one-half years ago and
has since been attached to the At-

~lantic squadron. He has formed

units from volunteers in eastern’

colleges including Penn State,

Temple, University of Pennsylva-

nia, and Westminster.

The latest decision of the Na-
tional Defense Mediation board
concerning the CIO-UMW demand
for a union shop in the steel com-
panies’ coal mines clearly forces
the Administration to decide its
position on the place of labor on

' the national scene today.

The New Deal was swept in and
was kept in office mainly on labor’:
vote. From 1933 to 1939 the
“public”-—of which labor is only a
third-—was pro-labor, in that it
motivated and generally supported
the President's pro-labor program.
Since the summer of 1940 national
problems have been relegated to a
backseat, with the begining of the

all-out defense effort.

Most of the public support the
President’s leadership in foreign
policy. Consequently any act by
any labor group which even seems
to impede this new national policy
alienates and antagonizes the pub-

lic. Public opinion has forced the

President to deny, seemingly, any
extension of 1abor’s privileges (al-
though the public stands behind
all of labor’s previous gains).

Labor however seems to think
this is the time to ﬁrmly entrench
itself, remembering the great un-
ion-smashing campaign after the
last war. Here the moral question
can be dropped: the i-ssue is no

in longer “are you for or against la-
bor?" but, for labor and its sup-
porters, it is “what should be la-
bor's tactics?"

" At the present moment———and es-

pecially in the coal dispute——a

‘strong labor position would seem

 do little more than further an- .
'T‘7tagonize the public to demand .
is greater curtailment of ‘labor privi-

f.I.eg'es than would result if labor

"mean at most ( 1) abandonment of
the union shop in all coal mines in
the country——unfortunately the
public has not been clearly told
that the union shop exists in 90
per cent of all soft coal mines; (2)
a voluntary surrendering of the
right to strike.

Insofar as most of the strikes
involving defense contracts have
been needless AFL jurisdictional
disputes, point (2) would be a
good thing. But valid union de-
mands—as is the CIO-UMW union
shop demand——would be settled by
government arbitration rather than
on a fairer basis of‘ union-company
economic power. This suggests the
main issue: the place of the Ad-
ministration.

President Roosevelt is exceed-
ingly wise on this point, in that his
respect for the democratic process
has allowed him to follow public
opinion on matters of national pol-
icy. The tragedy of this ﬁnal de-
terminant is the public’s ignor-
ance, due mainly to the failure or
the inability of the press and of
labor itself to correctly present the
issues. ‘

On thenational front today the
direction for labor to take is un-
certain. Aside from the adminis-
tration policy, it depends on too
many other question marks.

Is the AFL aligned for purely
political reasons against the (310?
Is the President shifting his favor
towards the AFL and away from
the CIO? What effect would Lewis’
1940 support of Willkie have on
such a shift? Have Lewis and the

President-—both astute and very -

sober politicians —begun a real
fight for labor leadership? Or have
they agreed to post-war conces-
sions for labor denials now?

The Book Drive

It’s been over a year now that
we’ve been adjusting ourselves to
the inconveniences of war-time—-
rising prices, scarceness of com-
modities, absence of friends and
relatives. We’ve patted ourselves
on the back, looked ourselves over
in the mirror, and said “It’s a
tough grind, but you’re doing a ﬁne
job, m’boy,” as we’ve reached for
the latest copy of Esquire.

But in the military training
camp, there's no back-slapping,
crumby mirrors, and no Esquire.

A letter, a card from someone
back home, an occasional movie, a
glance through the Rat-tail Comb
Manufacturer’s Journal or the
Lithographer’s Tri-Monthly are the
most vigorous forms of creative
reading which are presented to the
draftees.

On Monday SFA inaugurates its
drive for book donations. You to
whom the works of your favorite
author are accessible merely upon
presentation of a little yellow card,
you who are tired of blowing the
dust off favorite but long-discarded
volumes on your bookshelf, and
you who know darn well what it
feels like to be able to get hold of '
a good book when you want it,
you think it over.

Or The Return

Editor, the Pitt News:

Three times a week for several
eons, aeons, or what have you, or
at least since this semester began
have I, an amateur intellectual,
been bored, my jaded sensibilities
plunged in the gloomy deeps of
ennui as I perused the paranoiac
ravings of columnists, (so-called),
who scorn the trivial, the monu-
mental inﬁnitesimal, to dissect, ex-
amine cursorily, and happily ex-
plain the this and that, the why and
wherefore of anything or anyone,
past, present, or future.

And then, one ﬁne and sunny
morning, it came. The millennium.
At last a writer who really writes.
Who with skill consummate, (aid-
ed no doubt by a goodly supply of
reefers), throws with a ribald song
care and gloom to the winds. I re-
fer, of course, to, the inimitable,
the coruscating ravings of that
blessed madman, Jacquot.

’Twas too good to last. Did you,
as Lord High Executioner, swing
the bloody axe that sent his head
rolling gorily? Or did he obtain
pertinent data concerning one ’Avid
Admiress’ and withdraw from his
public for the attainment of needle

. points on his wolﬁsh fangs? Or

what ?

So please, dear Editor, hearken
to a voice crying in the wilderness
and recall the wandering prodigal.
Then may a beneﬁcent heaven
shower blessings on thy undeserv-

ing head.

D o c Carlson’: prescription,
translated from the Latin, follows:

1. The reader should take fre-
quent, but short, rest peri-
ods, applying hot towels to
the eyes.
He should shift his gaze to
distant objects. (What ob-
jects? Use your own judg-
ment.) .

2.

He should observe things on
a different plane. about the
room, such as wallpaper,
lampshades, and respectable

This prescription is guaranteed
to result in less eyestrain. (And

removed from their homes and
work to train to ﬁght, with guns,
tanks and planes built with
American sweat and money de-
fending the approaches to Lenin-

grad and Moscow—With all this-

there is no turning back. ’

The administration and congress
who are the representatives of the
people have said in effect that an
axisﬂdefeat is essential to the con-
tinued safety and security of the
nation. The time for greater sacri-
ﬁces and increased unity of action
is now.

_Members of the America First
Committee :-——America’s policy is
decided. Our president has prom-
ised to exert his efforts after an
allied ‘victory to see that no nation
is denied raw materials and oppor-
tunity for trade which is necessary
for its prosperity, making our pur-
pose a truly great one. Messrs,
Wheeler, Lindbergh, Clark and the
rest of you, sincere and honestly
conceived as your aims may be,
you can only emba__1'rass and retard

America but you cannot stop the»

tide of decency urging us on to
sacriﬁce for the creation of a better
world.

Labor: Your struggle is a just
one, and it is true that you have
been exploited by capital. But your
country is taking the most serious
step in its history. Remember, you
have won great gains in the past
few years under our free system.

ou know how labor fares under
Hitler. Help keep this nation free
by postponing your ﬁght for a
closed shop and you will reach
your objectives yet.

Capital: You have more at stake

than anyone. The system that al-
lowed Fords and Carnegies to
spring from comparative poverty
to tremendous fortunes needs to be
defended now. Don’t be greedy
about mercenary proﬁt. Give the
workingman a. chance to earn
enough to keep pace with rising
prices. Think of him as a human
being and not just another pair of
hands to help you amass greater
wealth.

Americans All: Unite behind our
elected leader. Instead of the lei-
sure of Hyde Park to which he
might have retired, he is enduring
a punishing pace at the helm of
the most gigantic effort in history.
We will sacriﬁce and suffer and
die.

The immediate future is clouded
with the darkness of misery- But
come what may, we will stand up-
right, content in the knowledge
that the heritage we leave will be
not worse than we found it, and
perhaps somewhat improved.

When the.\history of the times
come to be writtenelet it not be
said that when the opportunity to
salvage mankind from decadent
barbarism presented itself, we
were found scrapping among our-
selves for our own petty interests.

Let there rather be set down
besides the accounts of the exploits
of the brave men who began this
way of life and perpetuated it, that
we rose to the challenge united in
resolve, courageous in spirit and
made it possible for children and
generations following them, to live
in freedom from want, in peace,
and good will. ,

Where free man gather, whether
it is for the time being in dark
cellars, or in later" years in public
assemblage, let them look back on
us and say, “This was their finest
hour.” ‘

When the Pittsburgh Symphony
society planned their concerts for
this season, they made certain that
there would be a varied program
of music and composers represent-
ing most nationalities and peoples
of the world. And so when they
chose their soloists for this year’s
season theypdid not forget to in-
clude the famous Russian-born
cellist, Gregor Piatigorsky.

Tonight at 8:30 and Sunday aft-
ernoon at 3:30 this noted musician
will bring along his magniﬁcent in-
strument, a Montagnana cello of

1739, and with the accompani-

ment of Dr. Fritz Reiner and the

Pittsburgh Symphony orchestra,

play the Dvorak Cello Concerto in
this city's sixth pair of concerts.

He will also play the solo ’cello

part in Richard $trauss’s "Don

Quixote.”

Piatigorsky has been hailed by
Dr. Koussevitsky, conductor of the
Boston symphony, as “the greatest
’cellist of our day.”

Piatigorsky has played more
concerts in the United States and
Canada during the past eleven
years than any other cellist. He
has filled 450 engagements.

Cellist Piatigorsky was born in
Russia thirty-eight years ago. He
was on his way to a brilliant ca-
reer in his native Russia when the
revolution came. After escaping to
Poland, then Germany, he strug-
gled for a brief time playing in
cafes and theatres. But soon his
talents were recognized through-
out the European continent.

TONY PASTOR . . .

One of Mr. Pastor’s best discs
to date is his recording of two
“jive” tunes. A side has “Sunday-
in Savannah,” a slow drag tempo
number featuring Tony on the vo-_

" cal. Background is quite smooth

with deep voiced hornsrand steady
rhythm. Discmate is a new novelty
swingeroo entitled “J ohnnie’s in the
Pantry.” It’s chock full of rock.

‘DICK TODD . . .

The vocalist who is a cross be-
tween Bing and Bob Crosby but
doesn't compare to either, comes
through with "Delilah." Glenn Mil-
ler did the song previously and
Todd's vocal doesn't even compare
to Tex -Beneke’s. The only thing
that's good about “Orange Blos-
som Lane," on the reverse side, is
the line orchestral backgrounds.

TOMMY DORSEY . . .

Here is a hit if we ever heard
one. The successor to “Yes In-
deed!” has ﬁnally arrived. Sy
Oliver’s arrangement of “Swingin’
On Nothin”’ is really solid. The
rifting is terriﬁc with Jo Stafford
going all-out. Don’t pass this one
up. Tommy digs that classicr“0n
the Alamo” on the reverse. Five-
way reed work shines throughout,
but tune is just fair.

HARRY JAMES . . .

For thirty years “My Melan-
choly Baby” has been quite a fav-
orite. Now Harry James’ recording
will probably keep it popular an-,
other thirty years. If you like a
subdued trumpet and not one that
blasts you out of your chair, then
you'll surely like this tune. Flip-

the very smooth “Having a Lonely

To ward off pauperism resulting
from the usual unbalance of outgo
and income of allowances, two Cali-
fornia Tri-Delts are taking

washing. Rates have been set at»-
12 and 15 cents for cotton and silk
shirts with long sleeves—washed

and ironed. Shirts of the same

fabrics with short sleeves can be

washed and ironed at 8' and 10

cents. A petticoat can get through

the washer, the wring-er and past

the iron for 5 cents.

So, if lazy California co-eds
have shoulders rounded from
stooping but hands long-nailed and
delicately white, it is because the
Tri-Delt clothes lines are full and
two ingenious Tri-Delts have ‘the

They played for ten-minute
quarters, with 20 yard downs on-

these modiﬁcations the two groups
agreed on new sets of rules for the
game. Each player was required to
cut or tape her nails, thus reduc-
ing the possibility of slashed mem-
bers. Hairpins, jewelry and other
sharp objects were not worn.

As a convenience to the players

'Greatest,

inest' ln History Of Pitt

By BETTY McMAHAN

Two records were broken as the result of the Fordham
victory—the record for the most enthusiastic pep rally, and
the most orderly parade and downtown celebration ever or-

ganized by Pitt students.

No telephoned complaints were received by the adminis-

lor’s ofﬁce would begin to ring
as soon as
would arrive
Pittsburgh.

Newspapers reported no violence
or destruction of property by the
students. Pitt students “ran de-
cently amuck,” said one paper.

Speakers at the assembly rang-
ing from anyone connected with
the football team to administra-
tive ofﬁcers, shouted above the
cheers that “this demonstration is
the greatest show of student spirit
ever seen at a university assem-
bly.”

“In the 22 "years I have been at
the University there has never been
such enthusiasm,” exclaimed Dr.
Carlson, director of the men’s
Student Health service, as he stood
before a jammed auditorium.

“live never seen a student body
as wholeheartedly behind the squad

as you are,” declared Coach
Charles Bowser. V
Provost Rufus H. Fitzgerald

shouted: “This is the finest thing I

ever saw!’’

Soldiers’ and Sailors’ memorial
hall was ﬁlled to capacity. Every
seat was occupied and students
were ten deep at the rear ofthe
auditorium.

The rally was organized late
Sunday evening by Ben Foote,
C42, and an emergency SFA pep-
assembly committee. V

Foote’s group was made up of
Al lcardi, C43; Guy Wallace, C42;
Gus Wilde, C43; Bob Bentley,
C42; Ed Tablac, BA43; and Dick
Grifﬁths, C43.

The committee made an esti1nat-
ed 100 telephone calls, basing the

trative offices Monday. Usually the telephones in the Chancel-

organization of the rally on the
f1‘-aternity houses as the most eas-

.ily accessible group on campus.

Band members were called. About
11 o’clock that night, the hall was
contracted.

The next morning, 45 minutes
before the rally started, a parade
permit was obtained and with the

Action taken by the deans of
the undergraduate schools, Novem-
ber 10, 1941:

“In view of the unusual circum-
stances, and the cooperation and
line spirit manifestedby the stu-
dent body, it- is agreed to recom-
mend to the undergraduate facul-
ties that no cuts be recorded for
absences from day classes on Mon-
day, November 10.”

Secretary of the
Board of Deans-

aid of Inspector Dye, ‘in charge of

the traffic department of Pitts-

burgh, a police escort was obtained

to ‘handle more than. 350 cars in

the Pitt victory parade. “
In a letter to Coach Bowser, Mon-

day, Chancellor Bowman wrote:

Dear Mr. Bowser:

What a good day! My pride in
you and the team is beyond tell-
ing. In the long up-hill it was not
easy to keep up your spirit. But
how grand through all these days
the students have been! They
stayed with you in good sports-

manship. They believed in you’ and‘

in the will-to-win and in Pitt and
‘here we are.
Again, here are best wishes to
you and the team.

This time Swank Magazine is

Asserting that lip-kissing is
merely a lot of romantic ballyhoo
spread by poets and others of the
same ilk for countless centuries,
Swank’s February issue stated in
a sensational . expose, “Kissing
Must Stop," that kissing is taboo
in Japan; barred in Italy by Mus-
solini as bad for public morals;
and temporarily banned in several
colleges when coeds went on “kiss
strikes.”

Scientists claim, according to the
editors of Swank, that the thrill of
osculation springs largely from the
imagination; thus rubbing noses
would be absolutely as stimulating.

Designed to revolutionize Ameri-
can osculatory habits, the article
explained that kissing started un-
romantically enough when Roman

brushed their Wives’ lips to learn if
they had been drinking wine.

Aside ‘from these unromaniic

Nebraska was hit hard by grad-

But their optimism was far too
premature for after winning the
first two games over Iowa State

"B1'.ﬁ"' Jones, From Roses
To Dust Bowl In Year

Last year it was the Rose Bowl
for Major Lawrence “Biff” Jones
and his University of Nebraska
Cornhuskers. But this year it looks

 as though it will be nothing better
~ than their own Dust Bowl for the
‘ Major who is beginning his ﬁfth
year as coach of the Nebraska
team. Last year’s visitors at the
Pasadena classic have apparently
never quite recovered from the de-
feat they suﬁered there at the
hands of Stanford and its “T” for-
nation, for they have won but two
games while losing four thus far
this season.

teams had a record of nine won,

Cornhusker teams was Nebraska's
Rose Bowl bid last year.

The “biggest cake my oven can 
bake" was brought in by Mrs. Wil-
kcrs herself and placed at the ta-
ble seating players Fife, Dutton,\
Jones, and Saska. Because every
member of the team had perform-
ed in so outstanding a fashion no
particular player’; name was in-
scribed on the cake. lnstead, in ic-
ing script it read: ‘

Few Remnants Left of Once-

Although neither team is having
the kind of a football season that
their schools are accustomed to
having, the game between Pitt and
Nebraska will ﬁnd two hard driv-

morrow. Last yearthe Cornhusk-
ers went to the Rose Bowl. Thus
far this year they have a record of
two up and four down, while the
Panthers of course won their ﬁrst
game last Week.

Independent association mem-

when a booth in the elevator lobby
opened to take membership appli-

Hiram Milton, C42, president
of the group said, “We want ev-

long to IA, for it is the only group
with which he can affiliate himself
to solve his social and educational
problems.

“We are aiming at the"street-car
student,’ at the 80 per cent of the
student body which doesn’t have
any fraternity connections.”

IA is attempting to give these
students a full and real collegiate
life through association with stu-
dents who have the same problems,
Milton added. '

To do this, IA offers a complete
program‘ of low-cost social affairs
in _which any student may partici-
pate, and work on campus prob-

Membership in the organization

is not essential for participation in

the activities and the membership

“I wish ‘to make it clear that the
