Freshman Coeds Plan
Unit Activities Meeting
For Monday Afternoon

Marking the close of the mentor
period for freshman women, the
Freshman Unit assembly to be held
Monday at 1 o’clock in Stephen
Foster Memorial, will formally
open the unit period which will
continue for the remainder of the
school year.

Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of
women, will preside at the meet-
ing and will formally close the
mentor period which she opened
earlier in the year.

Since women are not permitted
to participate in major campus
activities during their freshman
year, smaller activity groups are
organized under the sponsorship of
WSGA, which the women may join.
The purpose of, these units is to
introduce freshman women to the
various. types of activities repre-
sented. by the major groups on
campus.

Gertrude Broido, C40, chairman
of the Unit Advisory council, will
discuss the purpose and plans of
the units and will introduce the
unit odyisers to. the freshmen.
After a short program, the fresh-
men will meet in their individual
units.

At this assembly, freshman
women will, for the first time, learn
to which unit they have been ad-
mitted. Each, girl had previously
listed two choices. Although the
units are limited to twenty-ﬁve
members, no girl has been placed
in a unit which she has not chosen.

According to. Miss Rush, assist-
ant dean of women in charge of
activities, “Through the units,
every freshman is given an op-
portunity to participate in activi-

ties. At present 218 girls have i

signed up and that is almost 100
per cent of the freshman class."
The ten units and their junior
class advisors are: acting, Mary
Gregg; camera art, Regina Ship-
man-; current literary review, Mary
Amman; French. Margaret Louise
Berg; glee club, Betty Langguth;
publicatiﬁnsi Alice Benovitz; public
speaking, Hilary Lurie; sports, Joy
Hartman; stagecraft, Ruth Mc-
Hcnry; writing. Mary Roche.

Piit Panther
Goes on Sale

Crashing through in style close
to that of the “Sutherland Scythe,”
the Pitt Panther brings out a sec-
ond issue in record time on Mon-
day.

The lapse of time is not the only
record this issue of the Panther is
making, however, for it will be one
of the largest issues seen on
campus for some time.

Bob Brown, C39, takes alpha-
betical precedence and offers a
short story under the heading of
“You Know Me, Felice.” A reliable
combination of the hat check girl
in a night club and the trumpet
player in the same establishment.
A twist makes the story very read-
able.

Olsen Will Direct Band

Continuing its string of swing

' A new type of formation will be
presented, and George Olsen, pop-
ular orchestra leader who is ap-
pearing. in person this week at the
Stanley theater, will direct the
Band in several numbers as guest
conductor.

Commenting on last week's nov-

press the Band’s appreciation for
the splendid cooperation offered by
the Coed ofﬂcers in performing the

Pitt Players Open Season
With Barry’s “Holiday”

IY SIDNEY SHORE
Emulating the star performance
of Low Arms in the screen version
of Philip Barry’: “Holiday”, Bill
Hoevelor turned in a “natural” as
dipsomaniac Ned Seton on the Fos-
ter Memorial stage last night.
Seriously. Hoevele: easily stood
out from an otherwise not too dis-
tinguished cast. Margaret Nelson,
Pat Franklin, and Lorene Kessler
took alternate honors as Julia,
Laura Cram, and Susan Potter.
As for the leads, Eleanor Haught
and August. Hofmann vacillated be-
tween the good and the very bad.
Eleanor lacked all the ﬁre and
spirit the role of Linda demands
because, I think, she was miscast.
Sophisticated comedy with a
message does not ‘suit the abilities

of an amateur collegiate cast. Ex-
cept for the “shining four” the
players would not or could not ﬁt
their roles. Harmon, Klemer, and
Solomon hardly fulﬁlled the prom-
ise of their parts.

The Barry dialogue was exceed-
ingly clever and the entire cast was
responsible for throwing away good
lines, The play, which is a “conver-
sation piece”, was just too much
for The Players. Parlor talk de-
mands capable actors.

Credit must go to James Lindsay
for the excellent sets and to the
costume director for some smooth
evening gowns. Make-up for the
men was poorly done, especially for
Harmon and Hoeveler.

This was no holiday for Pitt
Players.

“Corsages are taboo. We’re de-
pending on the good taste and
judgment of . our fellow Pitt stu-
dents to conform to our policy”
were the words of Hirsch and bus-
iness manager Edgar Cooke, C41,
re-emphasizing their no-corsage
policy, which this week caused
quite a bit of discussion on campus
and brought forth opposite opin-
ions from assistant dean of men,
Theodore Biddle, and dean of
women, Miss Thyrsa W. Amos.

And the executives added, “Don't
let your attendance at the bonﬁre
interfere with your attendance at
our dance. The rally is scheduled
to end at eight o'clock.” ‘

Tickets, priced at three dollars
a couple, will be sold at the door.

Committee In e mb e r s assisting
Hirsch and Cooke with prepara-
tions for the _dance include Jack
Glenn, chairman of publicity, Jack
McClain, Bob Ryan, Mary Jane
Firth, Dick Jones, Dick Bosch.
Philip Zang, Bob Goodwin, Mor-

Students Give
Play at Forum

Using the technique of the new
“group theater”, Pitt Peace Coun-
cil will present Irwin Shaw’s play,
“Bury the Dead", at Monday’s
meeting of Inquiry Forum at 1
o’clock in 132 Cathedral.

Pitt Players will enact the roles
in the condensed version of the
anti-war play which Broadway au-
diences acclaimed two seasons ago.
Included in the cast are Peggy
Nelson, C40, and Eleanor Haught,
C39, stars of Pitt Players’ produc-
tion, “Holiday”; John Weisbrod,
C39; and others.

“Bury the Dead" is a story of
four dead soldiers who refuse to
be buried. Monday’s presentation
will feature the spotlight technique,
wherein the characters, who are

standing in the darkness, read their _

lines when ﬂashes of light are
played on them.
Robert Saffron, C39, program

director for Peace Council, is pro-_ I

ducer-director of the play.

“At the Monday production stu-
dents will have ‘the opportunity to
see three major University activi-
ties collaborate; they may see the
ingenuity of the Peace Council,
the acting of Pitt Players, and ac-
quire a working knowledge of cur-
rent problems presented by Inquiry
Forum,” he states.

Sponsored by the YM-YWCA,
Inquiry Forum is a weekly meeting
open to all University students. It
presents discussions on problems in
economics, politics, religion, and
other fields.

Monday’s program is a “unique
way of presenting a viewpoint",
according to John Fri-tzmeier,
C39, Inquiry chairman. “We usu-
ally have a guest speaker voice his.
opinions during the ﬁrst half of
the hour with students ﬁlling up
the remaining period by question-
ing him.”

Inquiry Forum is managed by a
committee of six students and six
faculty members. Serving on the
executive committee with Fritz-
neier are Alice Rotzsch, C39;
Dorothy Cleland, C40; and Esther
Marcuson, C41.

Pitt Peace Council meets every
Wednesday in 135 Cathedral. Rosc-
:nary Lutz, C39, is chairman.

MacMi||an Gives
Lecture On Arctic

By ROBERT D. HAMILTON

Commander Donald B. MIcMil-
lan, famous Arctic explorer, gave
an illustrated lecture on “The Na-
tural History of the Arctic,” be-
fore the ‘ Pittsburgh Academy of
Science and Art last Thursday
night. ‘

‘ " Originally a teacher, he became

‘an’ Arctic‘ explorer in a curious

 . '.way.I-His father, ‘a’ sea captain,

made whaling trips into the Arc-
tic seas bringing back Eskimo
« clothing -for his son, and stories of
‘the North which ﬁred the boy's
imagination. .
Entering Bowdoin College, he

. became acquainted with Admiral
Robert Peary, ﬁrst white man to
reach the’ North Pole. After leav-

‘ ing the college, Commander Mac-

Millan I taught ‘for some time.
"While at’ Worcester Academy in
=Ma‘ss'achusetts he was able to help

in the rescue of .14 people’ en-

dangered in I-"a yachting accident.’
Admiral Peary, hearing of it,
invited him to come along on his
dash to the Pole as ornithologist
and "dog-team driver. Commander
 MacMillian‘]was one of the men
, who set ‘out with Peary for the
, Pole, but was forced to turn back
A when his feet were frozen at 85°
 north latitude, within- 15 degrees
\ of the pole. ”
" Dr.

MacMillan believes that}

'while’ there remains little geo-"
_‘jgraphic'al exploration to be done,

»mostly in the mapping of coast-
lines, that there is much unﬁnished
in the way of biological studies, es-
pecially in the ﬁelds of botany and
I zoology. 

Campus Canvass

Each week “Campus Canvass”
brings to you, via The News, a
ques_tion,‘tiinely and of student in-
terest. The students whose answers
appear are selected at random
throughout the University.

The Question:

Whom do you think the peo-
ple of Pennsylvania will elect as
governor and United States Sen-
ator in next week's elections?

The Answers

Phil Scheiding, C39:

The Democrats will win; both
Earle and Jones. The huge working
class in Pennsylvania remember
what the Democrats did for them;
they also remember what the Re-
publicans did not do when they
were in ‘power. I would vote Demo-
cratic. I think it is a progressive
party despite its blunders.

Jules Lott, BA38:

The scandal in which the Demo-
crats were involved dampens the
spirit of the party members, but
one still can ﬁnd no alternative in
the Republican party. V

When one considers the present
power of the Democratic machine
and the continued high regard by
the mass of workers for the “little
New Deal” in the state it becomes
doubtful whether the Republicans
have a chance.

Frank Reich, Law ’39: _ '

Charles Jones, undoubtedly, has
a decided edge in the gubernatorial
election. Between Davis and Earle
the outcome seems to be a toss-up
with Earle slightly ahead.”

Charles Dlugokenski, BA41:

I've given the matter quite a bit
of study and I think it will be one
of the closest fought elections that
‘we've ever had with the Republi-
cans emerging the ultimate win-
ners.

The graft charges brought forth
by Margiotti and Earle’s retalia-
tion with “streamlined” legislation
has given the Democratic party a
terriﬁc set back.

Harry Miller, Law '41: .

I think Earle will be elected sen-
ator and James governor. Although
I’d like to see Davis elected I don't
think he has a chance. Earle has,
because of the organization behind
him which is not supporting his

running partner Jones.”

Dr. Root, Mayer Diagnose

Wells -Welles  

By ALICE BENOVITZ

For the most part, the emotional
excitement..s‘.anse.d. by. the Orson
Welles production last Sunday has
died down, but ripples of interest
still stir the ﬂood of public opinion.

Thousands of people in every
profession and vocation are dis-
cussing and analyzing the over-
whelming reaction to what started
out as just another radio program.
Congressmen are demanding strict-
er censorship; college professors
are investigating the psychological
and literary, angles; network oili-
cials are .. offering explanations;
and the average listener is telling
anyone who will listen just what
his reaction was.

The consensus seems to be that
the major cause of the upheaval
was the “news flash" technique
used. Dr. W. T. Root, professor
and head of the psychology depart-
ment, said, “Anyone who tuned into
the program late and heard a news
ﬂash from the Secretary of the
Interior had the normal and log-
ical reaction of fright.”

Dr. Root went on to say that
the recent events in Europe which
had been broadcasted to the Amer-
ican public in news ﬂashes at all
times of the day and night had
probably created a psychological
set that facilitated the emotional
shock of this broadcast.

Mass hysteria entered the pic-
ture only when large groups of
people were caught up by the
rumor and lost themselves in an
emotional orgy. Since this was
Sunday night, a large number of
Church congregations were dig-

Radio Drama

turbed by hysterical people run-;
ning in with wild stories of the
“end of the world.”

Another angle to the situation.
is the technical or literary criti-i
cism of the Welles production.’
Frederick P. Mayer, associate pro-
fessor of English, said, “It was an i
unusually eifective and ﬁnished!
presentation in that it combined?
fantasy with such a realistic ap-
proach.

“I can understand the fright a
person might have felt at the be-
ginning of the program, but later
when the Martians entered the
scene, a little sophistication and
logic on the part of the listener
might have forestalled such unus-
ual excitement.”

Whether because of a sudden
spurt of scholarship or because
most of the students were listening
to Charlie McCarthy, the fact re-
mains that comparatively few stu-
dents heard the broadcast.

However, those who did tune in
after the beginning of the program
confessed that they were very
frightened. One coed called her
sister in New Jersey to ﬁnd out if
the Martians had invaded her
home. Another ran next door to the
neighbor for protection.

But the piece de resistance was
the remark of one News oﬂice
pundit that he didn't see what all
the excitement was about since ev-
eryone knows that Mayor Hague of
Jersey City is constantly on guard
to keep out all un-American ele-
ments—including Communists andi
Martians.

“They lost it, they lost it.” The
YWCA seemed to be seeking some-
thing Tuesday evening. The topic
for discussion was “The Quest for
Conviction.” We hope they found
it. Hulda Tully, C41, chairman of
the banquet, deserves the credit
for planning the evening entertain-
ment for 80 people.

Play Today
With WAA

There are many girls in 828
Cathedral these days during ﬁfth,
seventh, and eighth hours. 828 is
the locale of the new WAA rec-
reation room. Darts, ping-pong,
and dancing are the diversions of-
fered. You don’t have to be a jave-
lin hurler to dart into the recrea-
tion room and observe the ping-
pongcrs and shadrackers exhibiting
their skills. Join in the fun and
play today with WAA.

SCOTTIE

There is no need for officers of
the law at the Pi Lambda Phi
house. Even their pledges have or-
ganized. The beat of president was
given to Morris Levy. His subor-
dinates are Bill Klinkenstein, vice-
president, Howard Barr, secretary,
Jerry Goldman, treasurer, and Leo-
nard Cohen, social chairman. They
will probably assign the post of
ﬁrst kitchen-police to the newest
pledge, Jerry Leiber.

THE PITT NEWS

A FRIDAY, NOVEMBER L 1938

Carnegie Tech Prepared to Defeat
Pitt In Tomorrow’s City Battle

Beat Pitt! ‘

That battle cry has been dinning
in the ears of the 1938 Tech team,
the best in a decade, since the be-
ginning of the season, and tomor-
row at 2 o'clock Bill Kern’s Tar-
tans face the unbeaten Panthers in
the stadium with a better than
even chance of pasting the initial

ledgers.

Several factors weigh heavily in
Tech’s balance. Coach Bill Kern,

was first assistant coach when he
crossed Panther Hollow to the Tech
campus, knows Sutherland’s style
of play from the inside.
. FAST TEMPO

Pitt has been traveling at a fast
and furious tempo since the begin-
ning of the season. Every team
that Pitt faced was “up” and point-
ing for Pitt—shooting the works.
Panther reserves have been weak

team has been taxed—especially
during the last two games.

Coach Jock Sutherland was not
even before the Fordham game,

game of the season. Tech catche
Pitt after the hard Fordham game,
with Pitt still groggy from the
pound-ingand the fury-of the play.

them out of the game but which
will weaken Panther effectiveness.

TECH STRONG
Tech,‘ meanwhile, hasihad their
tough games sandwiched in be-
tween breathers. This same Tech

team defeated a Holy Cross squad
thatranks with the leaders in the
East. But their ace performance
of the year was turned in against
an undefeated Notre Dame team.

Tech lost, but it _took a referee,
who got his arithmetic muddled, to
swing the game for Notre Dame.
Tech outplayed the Irish, and up
until the fatal sequence of downs
held them to one ﬁrst down.

Last week the Scotch had a fair-
ly easy time; and they face tomor-
row’s kick-oﬂ’ well rested and in
good condition. For the first time
this year Tech will be at full
strength. Everyone will be off the
Skibo hospital lists, and Kern will
have the entire squad at his dis-
posal.

LEE IN LINE-UP

Fully recovered from a bad char-
ley horse which kept him on the
bench against Notre Dame and
Akron, Fullback Jack Lee will be
back in the line-up and will cap-
tain the Skibos against Pitt. Lee
is the best defensive back on the
squad and spearheads the Tech in-
terference on running plays.

Halfbacks Merlyn Condit and
George Muha are both climax run-
ners——deadly in the open ﬁeld.
Muha is a sophomore and rated as
the best back to reach the Tech
campus since Harpster. Condit’s
status as a brilliant back was es-
tablished in games last year and
during the ﬁrst half of this season.

CARNELLY THREATENS

 

TED KONETSKY

walkers. Cassiano, Stebbins, and
Chickerneo will attempt to carry
on their usual touchdown proclivi-
ties.

The front wall may differ a bit
from the usual line-up. Last week
Raskowski was benched by an in-
jury and Ted Konetsky ﬁlled in.
Konetsky played an excellent game
and Raskowski faces the problem
of regaining his tackle position.

Bill Daddio and Fabian Hoffman,
ends; Merkovsky and Raskowski or
Konetsky, tackles; Lezouski and
Petro, guards; and Dannies, cen-
ter, will be up front for Pitt.

'Soccer Team
Opens Season

Coach Dave Ward’s soccer team
gets its ﬁrst real workout today
when the Panthers travel to Slip-
pery Rock Teacher’s College to oili-
cially open the Pitt soccer season.

For the past month, Ward has
been testing his 25-man squad in

inter-club scrimmages, and While
the resulting team is naturally in-
experienced, the Pitt coach is
rather happy about the whole
thing. Unoﬁicial scrimmages with
the Carnegie Tech booters have
been better than satisfactory.
Fifteen men will make the trip
today. Starters will include Jack-
man, Englemore, Slack, Murray,
Haley, Crunkleton, V e n t r e s ca,
Brien, Soroka, Poe, and Anderson.
The four additional men had not
been named when this was written.

Work Of Pittsburgh Artists

By SHERMAN POCHAPIN _

A" Doing something real1y""‘Pitts-
burgh,” the department of Fine
Arts is exhibiting a show of paint-
ings of Pittsburgh artists of the
nineteenth cenitury until November

26 in the seventh ﬂoor galleries.
Undoubtedly the most famous
artist to have one of his works in
the exhibit is John James Audu-
bon. -"The Audubon piece is a "pen
and._ink portrait of Benjamin Page.
Phe portrait sketch was donﬁ in
L81‘?-{during one of Audubon’s vis-
.ts"’to'-,-this city.__*.a<«....:.._ ,
A truly. “up'-sfrom the bottom”
irtist , was Chester Harding, ‘_-who

’_;tartied out as a péddler in New

York,‘  and migrated to Pitts-
iurghg where he became a house
painter. He slowly drifted into por-
trait work and eventually -became
me of the fashionable’ painters of
he P¢1fiod. Harding later werit to

aortrait ;Qf' 9Harmar Denny, the‘
irst ,mayor of Pittsburgh, is being
rxhibitéd. . ‘
Demonstrating --that art; ‘even {in
he nineteenth centur-y,...cou1d con-
ain' humor, is a painting entitled
‘Whoa . Emma,” by David. G.
Blythe. ‘Blythe was a widely known
vood-carver and artist of the time,

; and by virtue of his ability  see

_ deiinite purpose. -

and illustrate the follies of life,
his works have been. widely ex-
hibited throughout the country.

A balloon-cheeked youngster,
haughtily spurning the cutlery he
clutches in his chubby hands, to
assist food into his mouth with his
free ﬁngers, is probably the most
appealing picture in the exhibit.
John Donaghy, the painter, chose
the then-not-original phrase “Fing-
ers Before Forks” to caption his
opus. ' _.  ’ 

Of great interest in these days
of major catastrophes are -two
paintings -‘by William‘ C. Wall. They
areboth of Pittsburgh after. the
Great Fire of 1845.-. .One .«view.~was
painted from Boyd’s Hill, now 9.
part of Duquesne, and the other
showing the north shore of the
Monongahela, was painted from a
borough then known as Birm_ing-
ham, now known _as the South Side.
Both of these "canvases were
loaned by the Carneg‘ie"Insti_tute.

Saunders Lists Results

Of Membership Drive

Alumni Enrollment 1

Reaches New High

Reaching the highest mark of

any membership campaign, the an-
nual autumn drive of the General
Alumni Association came to a
close last Tuesday evening at a
Schenlay dinner meeting
where ﬁnal reports disclosed the
new membership at 4,202.

Although the new mark only

surpassed last year’s record by
two members, Don F. Saunders,
executive secretary of the associa-
tion, is “not only pleased but sur-
prised”.

“On the basis of promises of
various school chairmen, I believe

that we will yet reach 5,000 new-

members,” states Mr. Saunders. He
expects more results from the
School of Dentistry because two
dental conventions interfered with
the recent two-week drive.

Largest sub-committee report
ca.me from the School of Educa-
tion and Graduate School which
enrolled 829 against the 449 of last
season's drive. The Schools of En-
gineering and Mines netted 633
compared to their 1937 mark of
590. The College reported 608
members, an increase of 58.

School of Business Administra-
tion reported 476 applications, last
year they had 506. Two hundred
ﬁfty-five were signed up by the
School of Law, surpassing last
year's total of 222. The School of
Pharmacy reported 350 new mem-
bers against 447. The School of
Medicine increased last year’s 519
by 10.

Dr. Andrew P. D’Zmura, a mem-
ber of the School of Medicine’s
committee, is among the leaders in
the individual campaign. He se-
cured 50 new members.

Chairman of the campaignwas ‘

John B. Nicklas, ’22, vice president
of the association. Miss Jean Hay
was leader of the drive among the
women.

First meeting of the campaign
was held two weeks ago at a din-
ner meeting at the Hotel Schenley.
A report meeting was held last
week when it was announced that
2,900 had signed up. At the be-
ginning of last Tuesday's meeting
the results totaled 3,140.‘

Relentlessly a mechanical mouth at Bell Tele-
phone Laboratories keeps talking . . . talking . . . "
talking into this new type telephone. Other telephones
are being frozen, steamed, baked, lifted and dropped
into their cradles by machines.

  

Why all these laboratory tortures? Simply because
your telephone must prove it can take more use and
abuse than it will ever get in its normal lifetime. It must
be ready to give you the best possible telephone service.

Exhaustive testing of Bell System apparatus is one
reason you can depend on your telephone always.

Why not telephone home oftener?
