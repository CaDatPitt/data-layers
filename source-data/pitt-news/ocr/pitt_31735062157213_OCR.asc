Of Women

In a biting rebutaal to “Taxon-
omy Of The Distaff,” printed in

which Gene N ovak catalogued Pitt
women into five distinct types——
and none of them an American
Beauty, Peggy Bodin gives ﬁve
male counterparts in her article
“Et Tu Brute,” ,due in the May
17 issue of the mag.

According to reports from the
Panther staff, Miss Bodin .pulls
no punches, in fact, she makes a
few blows below the belt.

She expounds on the following
types of Pitt men: the bitter vet-
eran, who wears officer pinks and

ard, who affects a casual dress, is
very pale, and never opens his
eyes completely; the fraternity
man, the most nerve-wracking of
the lot because there is no end to
them; and the athletic type, who
is the least harmful of the ﬁve
because he is the most child- like.

Novak started something, and the
women are going to have the tra-
ditional last word."

 .C Tomorrow morning and afternopn, Pittwill‘
be asked to. contribute to a nebulous sounding
container, the Pitt Chest. This chest, however,
has more than cubic measurement to verify its
existence. ' i
A few semesters ago, Pitt was getting mighty
perturbed about the number of charity organi-
z‘ati0ns that tried to solicit funds on campus.
No matter how worthy these organizations are
the conscientious student or faculty member
found himself digging deep into a not-too-deep
pocket every month. No matter how the busi-
ness cycle moves, this is a problem to the stu-
dent and to the, faculty member.

Student Congress. last semester felt that
some answer should be made to the fund situ-
ation. They have come up with thisCPitt Chest.

The Pitt Chest combines the. campus drives
of the Community’Chest, Pitt in China, the
Student Loan Funds, WSSF, and others into

_ one big drive. It is done for convenience,-and,
,incidental1y,‘for the beneﬁt of these groups.

‘Certainly it is ‘easier to contribute Once and

know that you won’t be bothered again.

' For this reason we ask that everyone con-
tribute to the Pitt Chest. The committee is
asking antwo dollar response. We think that
two ‘dollars should be a minimum response.

CHelp the Chest committee reach its goal,
help the various charities involved, andtmake
it easier for yourself at the same time. The
cost: two dollars.’ '

Back to the books. ‘Spring Festival has

come and gone for another year. Festival, no
doubt, "will be back next year, and if the

,present_ trend continues, next year’s produc-

tion should be something bordering on the col-
losal. This year’s was itself within hailing dis-
tance of. that adjective. ' ,
Much of the credit for the success of the
Festival goes to chairman McMorris and his
co-"managers Madden and Matonak. This triols
hard work paid oﬁ in what has been generally
considered as the best of Pitt ’s modern spring
celebrations. The smoothness with which the

events were? run oif testiﬁes t0 the. thorough-

ness of the committee’s preparation. .
Along with the accolade to the committee
should go, we think, some mention of the ﬁne
spirit withvwhich Pittstudents received and en-
tered into -the" festivities. C . - . '

The enthusiasm and interest shown bythe
students augeifs well for the future. They show

‘that givensomething worthwhile with the right

Equaﬁon Gives Allswer

To More Than Machines

t

By Bill Veenis ——-——-
‘ Engineering is a course composed of science-
‘logic, based on fundamental equations and ax-
ioms. It proves less interesting toC_the layman‘than
student government to a cynic. But it has point.
The most useful of all formulae plugged
into the leaking brains of embryo engineers is
the efficiency equation and axiom. In short, it
reads: Eﬁiciency equals input divided by out-
put, and never greater than 100 percent.

The efﬁciency equation is useful far beyond the
realm of physical science. It seems to apply equally
well to the ‘art of living. . ’

Last Friday afternoon, at the Tap Day lunch-
eon, I wondered just how many of us sitting there
and patting ourselves on the back realized how
and why we were there. More particularly, Iiwas
interested in the number of persons who we know
had contributed to life at Pitt who were not around
the banquet table. There are many, perhaps with
shorter activities records than those present, who
contributed. C

C The rule of eﬁiciency-—never greater than

100 percent—seems to apply more to the guy
who wasn’t lauded than to the tappees. In
fact, it applies equally well to both. _

The best of ‘steam engines seldom has an e.ﬁ‘.i-

. ciency greater than 20 p.exgu'cent. The‘ most effi-

cient gasoline engine is for hate to reach a high
of 4-0 percent. Electrical machineryhas the honor
of top place with a comfortable 80 percent. In no«

-case, does a machine push over the ‘100 mark.‘

You just don’t get more than you put in. 
How ably this point applies to life. How -muchC

j more sensible, a philosophy than that of the cynic
who. expects everything on a

-platter. It just doesn’t-
work that way, Bud. ~ C . -
No matter how much energy a person" ap-
plies to a project, how much initiative he places
‘in a new ﬁeld, how anxious he is about results,
he is bound to‘ experience some pangs of dis-
appointment. He can’t expect 100 percent re-
sult. .
_From this standpoint it is diﬂicult to under-
stand‘ that person who won’t take this time to be
interested in the people or the ‘activities around.
him and thinks life treats him rough. ‘He can’t
seemi to see what the engineer knows": you don’t

How many students know that there are health iser

of Miss Ethel M. Woomer, registered nurse _and secret
the 34th floor offices of the Men’s Health service. ‘

‘Seniors, and even graduate stu-
dents, come up here and tell us
that they just found out that ﬁrst-
aid facilities are available ingthe
school.” ’

This is unfortunate, for the phy-
sicians and nurses of the ‘two
health services are well qualiﬁed
to advise students on their health
problems, physical or mental. _

The Men’s Healthservice staff,
headed by Dr. H. C. Carlson, in-‘
cludes Dr. R. C. Tomarelli, and
Dr. P. J. McKeating. Dr. Auleene.
M. Jamison, who directs the 28th
ﬂoor Women’s Health service, is
assisted by registered nurses Eve-
-lyn Heighley and Mildred Little.

In addition to giving ﬁrst aid
and medical advice, the services
receive all notiﬁcations of absence
due to illness, and communicate
with the proper deans of the Uni-
versity. Students returning to
classes following illness must re-
‘port to the service with a state-
"rnent of the attending physician in
order to obtain a certiﬁcate which
serves as an excuse to instructors
whose classes have been missed.

Physical examinations are given
to incoming freshmen, to students
enrolling in the‘ School of Educa-
tion, and to all students participat-
ing in athletics. Health records
are kept on all veterans. _ 'C

Even less generally known than

.Si’rate Receives Grant

For Farm Research

STATE COLLEGE, Pa.—A research grant of $8000 has been given
the Pennsylvania State college by the Allegheny Conference on

Community Development for the

purpose of investigating agricul-

tural potentialities of the Pitts-¢
burgh area.

The study is designed to deter-
mine the most desirable‘ type of
agricultural development and the
possible ma_rket for agricultural
production of counties in South-
western Pennsylvania, Ohio and
West Virginia. '

The departments of agricultural
economics and rural sociology

will conduct inquiries into the
number and sizes of farms, rural
populations, and production facil-
ities; also the uses and acreage of
land and the numbers and types
of livestock.

This project is a continuation of
research undertaken cooperative-
ly by the College, the Allegheny
conference, and the Pittsburgh
Chamber of Commerce.

NORMAN, Okla (IP)—-Thanks
to Will Rogers memorial fund
scholarships, 26:.handicapped stu-
dents are attending the University
of Oklahoma this year and pre-
paring for work that will enable
them to become active citizens.

Since 1939, when the fund was
established in memory of Okla-
homa’s humorist—philosopher, 156
students have been given assist-
ance through grants. Dr. M. O.
Wilson, chairman of the fund com-
mittee, says virtually every schol-
arship granted is capped by a
success story.

“One crippled boy became a
lawyer. Another an outstanding
ﬁction writer. Others are engi-
neers, doctors, pharmacists, min-
isters, teachers, librarians and
salesmen.”

Many of the students, who re-
ceive sums ranging from $30 to.
$50, are crippled, blind, deaf, or
have heart ailments and other
handicaps. The amount given is
determined by the difference be-
tween the student’s needs and re-
sources.

 Everyone has had the experience of changing horses in mid-

i strea.m—-even professors.

Dr. J. Warren Nystrom, head of the geography department, be-
gan his undergraduate work with an eye toward a major in history.
;But in his senior year, after taking a few geography courses at Clark

University, Worcester, Mass., he switched saddles and set out to
teach others the wonders of far off lands.

5 Geography is a family affair
 with Dr. Nystrom, since hisiwife
_? and their two sons have an equal
T’ ‘ enthusiasm for the subject. In
_ fact his wife has often joined him
 in his extensive travels through
R_ the United States, Canada, and
Caribbean area, and South Amer-
ic-a.

“Teaching f r o m experience

, ' often increases the interest,” said
Dr. Nystrom. Although the exper-
ience can be rather trying, he add-
ed remembering his experience in

. British Guiana.

Through some mistake he and
his wife entered British Guiana
without entrance permits, . but

, .were forbidden to leave without

 exit. permits.

 For four days Dr. Nystrom and

Homer by Daugherty

Gives Pi KA 4-2 Win

Pitcher Frank Dougherty,

kept PiKA’s undefeated string

intacit by clouting a home run in the fourth inning of a tie

’_ ball game, forcing another loss on Delta Tau Delta, 4-2. The

game was played at Trees Field Thursday. _,
With the score tied at 2-2, “Jake” Jacobs grooved a pitch
to Daugherty that had “Ralph 9 ‘

Kiner” engraved on the seams.

Frank promptly slammed the ball
out of the park to give PiKA the
game, 3-2.

Joe Ingelido iced it in the ﬁfth,
hitting another roundtripper off
Jacobs. The ball traveled the
length of the track house in left
ﬁeld. '

V The same afternoon the Phi
Delts and Phi Lams enjoyed a day
full of base knocks, the Delts com-
ing out on top, 11-9. The losers
loaded the sacks in the ﬁnal frame
with only one away, but Delt
pitcher Bob Drummond, couldn’t
be solved for the hit that twould
have sent the game into extra in-
nings.

Selwin Berson started on the
mound for the Lams, Jordy Segal

Potent News
Dares Panther

An old proverb helped to per-
petuate an ancient eighth ﬂoor
tradition this morning. Mumbling
about “Time, the great healer,”
Bill Veenis, News Editor, chal-
lenged the Panther-Orwl staffs to a
softball game.

Wits had a ﬁeld day reminding
Veenis of the pasting absorbed by
the Mighty News Cagers, in De-
cember when the Panther staff
blasted the News quints, 51-34.

The News nine has appeared
twice at Ellsworth Field where
they pounded out impressive vic-
tories over All-Star teams. “We’re

The only chance for Pitt fans
to yell was provided by third
baseman Dodo Canterna. Dodo
drove a home run into the center-
ﬁeld seats for the first offthe ﬁeld
circuit clout this season.

Canterna’s third—inning appear-
ance at third base was a surprise,
for he had previously told Mit-
terling that he was leaving the
team because of a conﬂicting Eng-
lish class.

ScOTcH'N SODA'S MUSICAL Revue

By Max Scherb

Pit.t’s football team complet-
ed its spring practice drills last
Friday. If they are to to be put
on the ﬁeld next fall, however,
the University will have to hire
Navy divers to go through
Trees Field and ﬁnd them. ,

Slavedriver Mike Milligan put
his forces through the ﬁnal ses-
sions despite one of the heaviest
downpours of the spring. By 4
o’clock, Bill Bruno was observed
going over left tackle stroking the
Australian crawl.

Milligan and his staff proved
that they were with the boys and
didn’t desert them. Mike proved
to be‘ a rainy day fashion plate.

A Muddy Bruno Scores

Only about 30 men were used
in the almost two hours of -con--
stant scrirnmaging. The wet (ﬁeld
necessitated, the”? overconcentra-
tion. The poor conditions prevent-
ed a complete judgment of the
scrimmage. —

The first team managed to score
against the second with only a
few minutes remaining in the
practice. The catch was that Bill
Bruno had to be moved from
the second to the first backﬁeld in
order to score.

Len Radnor, Leo Skladany,
Tony Razzano, and many other
mainstays were sidelined prior to
this practice with injuries. These

Better Next Fall

However, there can be little
doubt that the squad will improve
over last year’s outﬁt. The added
experience plus the slight light-
ening of the schedule load should
mean something next fall. And
the reserve strength is deepened.

Milligan and his men have ad-
journed for the summer and Will

tember. They have workedhard

MINNEAPOLIS, Minn. (IP)-—.
The general belief that war ext
perienccs have altered the voca-
tioiiahplaiis bf American Veterans
is discounted by a nationwide sur-
vey on veterans’ education made
by the American Cw.“-uncil on Edu-
cation with ‘£9 backing of Disa-
bled American Veterans.

Results of the study indicate
that more than half (51 per cent)
of the veterans now enrolled in

college and universities are pre-

paring for the same vocations they
planned to enter before they went
into the armed services, accord-
ing to E. G. Williamson, Dean of

University of Minnesota,
who acted as chairman of the sur-
vey committee.

However, considerable change in
vocational aims was found among
disabled veteran students. Of this
group, 46 per cent of married stu-
dents and 43 per cent of single
students enrolled in programs
leading to occupational goals dif-
ferent from those they had in
mind prior to the war.

Frets Reserve
Right to Limit
Membership

COLUMBUS, o.—.'rhé right of
fraternity groups to restrict mem-
bership according to race, color,
and creed is democratic, stated Jo-
seph A. Park, Ohio State univer-
sity dean of men. ‘

Mr. Park said that in voicing
this opinion he was reiterating a
statement made by David E; Em-
bury, chairman of the National In-
terfraternity Conference, at a two-
day meeting of United States and
Canadian representatives of fra-
ternities in New York last week.

Mr. Embury-said, “The college
fraternity is the closest knit, most
intimate group to be found any-
where outside the family group.
The members live together, and
share each other’s joys and sor-
rows. What then could be more
natural, more important, than
choosing new members of the
same racial, religious. social, and
cultural backgrounds as their
own?” '

Dean Park said» he welcomed
the formation of a new inter-ra-
cial fraternity, Lambda Alpha
Gamma, on‘the campus, but that
it was also democratic for groups
to be able to select their members
according to their own standards.
