Mayor
talks of

From new jobs to Plan B, Pittsburgh

’ Mayor Tom Murphy ﬁelded an array of

questions Tuesday at a forum in the William
Pitt Union.

Conspicuously absent from the
evening’s discussion was the controversial
House Bill 907, which Murphy supported
but Gov. Tom Ridge vetoed. .

Plan B was the initiative city oﬁicials
drafted to frmd the construction of two new
stadiums, among other improvements.

House Bill 907 was a bill recently
passed in the state legislature to take old
laws off the books. Aprovision buried in the
language allowed Gov. Ridge to approve
the last $150 million needed for Pittsburgh’s
stadiums. Most of the legislators who
passed the bill didn’t read it thoroughly and
didn’t realize what they had done.

The evening’s discussion centered
around jobs and the economic rejuvenation

of the city.

During the ﬁrst half of the session,
Murphy addressed the audience, comprised
of Pitt students and younger adults.

“I believe you’re in the most’ exciting
city in America,” Murphy said to the audi-
ence. “A city that is re—inventing itself.”

Murphy relayed an anecdote from his
childhood during the open forum. He spoke
oftworuleshehadasachildlivinginthe

city: having to be home before the street
lights came on and not being allowed near
the river.

“Now we are breaking both of these

rules,” he said, refening to city initiatives .

and on Washington’s Landing.

State representative Tom Druce did-
n’t need his constituents to tell him col-
lege tuition costs were high in
Pennsylvania. He could see that for him-
self.

All he had to do was open the news-
paper and read about tuition and fees
increasing with each passing year, or scan
the bulky education reports that fell on his
desk in his East Wing Harrisburg oﬁice
warning of the decreasing aﬁ‘ordability of
college.

But what it all came down to was the
fear he felt after looking at his own chil-
dren. Like many fathers, he worried that
he might not be able to provide his kids
with a quality college education.

Gathering the support of his colleagues in
the House, Druce put together a resolution
calling for the Subcommittee on Higher
Education to embark on an in-depth study
into increasing tuition costs, a plan the
House adopted in March.

“My goal at the start of this was for us

keep tuition low. I
don’t buy that. I think these schools need
to be more efficient.

“If we give more money, it’s coming
from the taxpayers. It’s taking money
from one pot and putting it into another.”

Shopping for a college is like shopping
for clothes — the university must ﬁt you.

“Just like you want to look nice in the
clothes you buy, you want to feel good
when you say you attend a certain universi-
ty,” said Linwood N. Harris, associate direc-
tor of Admissions and Financial Aid “Some
students base their decision to oorne to Pitt
on the size of city and school, the cost of the

mented in Oakland, Shadyside and Squirrel
Hill.

He said he’s ﬁghting homelessness by
adding 5,200 units of public housing that
are under construction or in late develop-
ment stages, 2,200 of which are designed
for the low- to rniddle-income families.

“Every time we build something, there
is always 100 or so people telling us we
can’t take the risk. Instead of telling me
what you’re against, tell me what you’re
for,” Murphy said throughout the forum.
Each time the audience responding with
applause.

Murphy said a plarmed $500 million
Coke factory in the city will employ more
than 2,000 construction workers, as well as
provide 450 pennanent positions within the
building, some of which could be held by
former union steel workers‘.

Murphy said he believed his plans will
create more employment opportunities in
Pittsburgh than the number of people need-
ing jobs.

Another issue raised at the forum con-
cerned the lack of cleanliness within the
city.

“We are a dirty city; it’s unforttmate,”
Murphy said

He armounced a program that will
begin next year in Oakland to clean up the
streets. Murphy said he plans to hire 30
additional workers to roam the city and

Murphy also said he’s heard to nurner—
ous comments about building new stadi-
ums, but one stuck out in his mind.

“I keep hearing ‘don’t use our tax
money to keep [the Steelers and the Pirates]
here, but don’t let them leave,”’ he said.

The majority of the forum’s audience
agreed that if any of the sports teams left it
would generate bad publicity for the city.

A Pitt graduate student from New York
talked about a commercial he saw on televi-
sion while home for Thanksgiving break.
The commercial for Cable Vision stated that
without cable, New York City would be
Pittsburgh, implying that Pittsburgh was an
undesirable city to live in.

Murphy responded that in order to mar-
ket the city of Pittsburgh, “we need to
believe in ourselves.” , '

He responded by speaking about an
event that took place about a month ago in
Pittsburgh, when members of the Fortune
500 visited.

“They were stunned on how the city
had changed,” Murphy said of the CEO’s
who had not been in the city for several
years.
One CEO was given a tour of the city
and was pleasantly surprised at the changes.
In fact, Murphy said, the executive said
Pittsburgh is now on the top of the list as a
possible city to build the cornpany’s eastern
American headquarters.

“Pitt has students from all over, even as

“Just because their parents make certain

McKnight said. “The
student might feel that
it would be best if they
stay at home.”

McKnight added, “college is a wake-up
call for many African American students,
and there are a lot of different aspects to col-
lege life that students just don’t take into
consideration.”

Students need a healthy balance
between academic and social life, he said. If
the students party too much they might fail,
and if they study too much they might have
a nervous breakdown. .

McKnight added that in order to ﬁnd
solutions for low retention rates, Pitt has to
take one step at a time.

“It’s an ongoing process that no one can
solve,” said McKnight.

Student arrested for

Erin. Lindeman
Senlor Staff Writer
Pitt police arrested a student Monday
after three women complained he
crouched under desks in Hillman Library,

/

looked up their skirts and touched their ’

legs.

One woman said when she discovered :
Aaron Kastein, 18, beneath the desk he 0
told her he was just playing hide—and—seek
and he was sorry.

Police charged him with one count of
harassment after he confessed to the accu-
sations. -

The women, who ﬁled three separate 5

complaints, each reported feeling some-' '

one touch their legs from underneath desks V

on the ﬁrst and third ﬂoors of the library.

Police declined to release the names /2‘

of the three victims who ﬁled complaints. ’

One of the women reported seeing
Kastein lingering in the library after she
had called the police. When the oﬁcers
arrived at the scene, Kastein was still on
the ﬁrst ﬂoor of the library.

T‘wo Pitt Police officers arrested
Kastein at 8:53 p.m. Ofﬁcers interviewed

‘ Kastein, and he confessed during a subse- 5

quent interview conducted at the Pitt !
police station.

Pitt police Commander Tim Delaney.

not a run-of-the mill investigation like a _

‘ THE PITT NEws

TUITION

into rnid-November, members of the sub-
committee organized 11 public hearings at
which more than 72 people ranging from
parents, students, professors and college
administrators to ﬁnancial aid ofﬁcers,
public policy makers and representatives
from education commissions testiﬁed.

This isn’t the first time Pennsylvania
has looked at state higher education and
tuition costs.

In 1985, the Kirby Commission,
under Governor Richard Thornburgh,
marked the ﬁrst time in recent state histo-
ry that a sincere effort was made to study
post—secondary issues and come up with a
set of recommendations. Later came the
master plan of 1986, which was to be a
tool state policy makers could use in
improving higher education.

Then, in 1994, a House special task
force concluded its work with a set of
draft recommendations, and in 1995,
another committee, chaired by Rep. John
Lawless, R-Montgomery County, deliv-
ered yet another set of recommendations.

Nothing substantial came out of the
plans, commissions and task forces of the
past, said Pat Carone, a Butler County
Republican who recently left the state
House after serving six years in ofﬁce, at
a Nov. 23 press conference in Harrisburg
on the subcomrnittee’s ﬁndings. The out-
look doesn’t look much brighter for the
state’s most recent study.

“We will need to continue ourwork
next year,” said Rep. Wﬂliarn Robinson,
D—Allegheny County, minority chair of
the Subcommittee on Higher Education
and a former Pitt trustee. “You will prob-
ably see this work implemented into
another resolution in the future.”

And as the 12 recommendations
make their way from one resolution to
another, they won’t have the added sup-
port of two representatives who built a
reputation of expertise in higher education
issues. Both Carone and Ronald Cowell,
an Allegheny County Democrat and also a
former Pitt trustee, decided not to run for
reelection and left ofﬁce two weeks ago.

In her last term of ofﬁce, Carone
chaired the House’s subcommittee on
Higher Education and spent the better part
of the last six and a half months attempt-
ing to wade through the ﬂood of infonna-
tion "and ﬁrst person -testimony with her

subcommittee to ﬁnd the essentials. What

the subcommittee came up with were rec-
ommendations “intended to provide a
more rational and more effective
approach to developing and implementing
state policies pertaining to higher educa-
tion in Pennsylvania.”

The subcommittee advised the
General Assembly to better utilize tools
such as the State Board of Education’s
Master Plan for Higher Education, the

annual state budget process, and state ~

appropriations, among other things, to
promote efﬁciency among the state’s
postsecondary schools. It even went so far
as to recommend that the General

Assembly establish a blue-ribbon com-
mission dedicated to advisingxlegislators
and the State Board of Education on l1igh—
er education issues, especially those per-
taining to the Master Plan.

' Robinson said while the state does
have a master plan to direct higher educa-
tion policy, it is often times pushed to the
side and not consulted. The subcommittee
wants to see this changed.

“The State Board of Education is
working on updating the Master Plan right
now,” said Dan Langan, deputy press sec-
retary for the Department of Education.
“We agree with the subcommittee that it
should be utilized.”

The subcommittee also suggested the
General Assembly implement perfor-
mance—based funding. Schools receiving
state money to operate will only receive
more if they meet a set of requirements
designed to increase cost efﬁciency and
reduce tuition.

“I offered the idea of the state not
appropriating money to institutions
increasing tuition more than the rate of

He Said

inﬂation as a place to start,” Druce said.
“But by the time everybody on the sub-
committee was brought up to speed on
Pennsylvania higher education, we didn’t
have time at the end to develop consen-
sus.’’— : , . ' - .

Ann Dykstra, Pitt’s _director of com-
monwealth relations, believes the recom-

mendation for linking the level of state-

funding a university gets to how efficient-
ly it operates holds the greatest impor-
tance for Pitt.

“Pitt would not be adverse to dis-
cussing performance-based funding, but
we’ve found that where it’s worked the
best is with a relatively small proportion
of the entire appropriation spending,”
Dykstra said. “Cutting costs and cutting
revenue and cutting tuition is one thing,
but when it starts to affect the quality of
education  the General Assembly has to
really look at that.” .

Robert Pack, vice provost of . academ-
ic planning and resources management,

said Pitt has taken steps to keep net tuition .

.s_s .&.I- n

the same percentage of total University
revenue for the past ﬁve years. ‘He said net
tuition accounted for 22 percent of
University revenue in 1994 and the exact
same amount this year.

But, in order -to maintain this percent-

1 age, Pitt not only had to increasetuition an

average armual rate of 4.4 percent in the
last ﬁve years, it also had to severely trim
low—priority programs such as -the
Department of Slavic Languages and
Literatures —— programs some students
ﬁnd to be of the highest priority —— as well

~ as turn away ‘talented faculty because it

couldn’t afford to hire them. A
During this same period, Pack said,
the state appropriation has slightly
declined as a percentage of Pitt’s total rev-
enue, from 18.5 percent ﬁve years ago to
17.4 percent this year. _
“Colleges must contain their costs

_scrupulously,” Katherine Henderson,

president of Point Park College, told sub-
committee members in July. “But the fed-
eral and state governments must increase
their subsidies.”

Druce said everyone must look at the
total picture. And what he sees are schools
expanding their course offerings and carn-
puses, and departments having faculty
members teach three or four students in
one class.

“We need to make institutions really
make a case for their [tuition] increases,”
Druce said. “We are not going to feed
their increases.” '

This back and forth between universi-
ties and legislators is not limited to
Pennsylvania, said Jackie  director
of federal policy analysis for the
American Council on Education.

“What we’ve seen from legislators
around the country is they want more
accountability,” said King. ' ,

While Pemrsylvania public universi-
ties do not have to abide by a strict set of
state—irnposed line items on their budgets,
and most likely won’t have to in the
future, many want to ensure universities
use state money in the most effective way
possible — especially in a time of rapidly
expanding technology when the desire to
provide Students with every available
resource is at an all-tirne high.

“Obviously, tuitions at state—support—
ed and state-related schools have gone up

 because state ﬁmding has not kept pace,”

said Peter Balcziunas, executive director
of the Pennsylvania Association of
‘Colleges and. Universities. “On the other
hand, institutions did not have to install
ﬁberoptics underneath their campuses to
provide students with Internet access and
entrance to the global library.”

He said students have to decide if
they want services such as counseling, the
most recent books and joumals in their
libraries, or new, modern dorms. If they
do, he said, someone’s got to foot the bill,
and chances are, it’s going to be them —
in the fonn of higher tuition costs.

“What the consumer in higher educa-
tion has to decide is if the improvements
in higher education are ones they want,”
Balcziunas said.

What the hell iswrong with some
Hillman Library patrons?

This is one of those occa-
sions to just shake your head
and ask, “What the hell?”

A “hide-and-go-seek stu-
dent,” whose antics are so ludi-
crous they could easily be
passed off as urban legend, was
caught Monday by Pitt Police in
Hillman Library.

He was caught hiding under
desks and cubicles, apparently
waiting for any woman wearing
a short skirt to sit down, and
just remaining there. His
excuse, upon discovery, was
that he was playing hide and go
seek.

What is it about Hillman
Library that it makes it a haven
for this sort of behavior? Does
Hillman’s large collection of
pornography create an atmos-
phere conducive to bizarre male
shenanigans? ‘

Still on the loose is the noto-
rious masturbator. You’ve prob-
ably heard the story: The loose-
ly wristed denizen (or denizens;
maybe the infamous faculty-
student masturbation club has
moved its headquarters from the
second-ﬂoor bathroom of the
Cathedral to Hillman Library)
masturbates under the desk,

usually in the line of sight of a
girl who’s studying.

While complaints have been   

lodged about incidents of this
nature occurring in the library,
it is still quite bizarre that it has
taken so long for one of these
weirdos to get caught. ‘

With finals fast approaching

-;n. . ~«

and Hillman’s hours     

to 24 hours a day, the presis-tire-i‘?
is on, and the temptation to do
strange, crude and utterly dis-
gusting things may be that
much greater.

It’s also quite twisted that
it’s now no longer gum we’re
supposed to watch out for under
the desks.

Textbook thieves and those
who use the private study rooms
as a sex parlor have nothing on
these clowns. This is nothing
short of depraved. This sort of
behavior is just plain creepy. If
you see" someone pulling off a
stunt of this nature, report it
immediately. ‘

With one oddball having
been caught, perhaps some of
the lewd behavior will be
curbed, as well as the sopho-
moric jokes that arise from such
incidents.

" ,1 I: didn’t know Anthony DePasquale,
-the Pitt; junior who died Friday at the Pitt-
Duquesne women’s basketball game.
However, when I read about his death in
Monday’s Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, I was
instantly touched and inspired by learning
about the way he lived his life.

DePasquale, a 20-year-old communi-
cations major and a student manager for
Pitt’s men’s basketball team, died from a
heart attack as a result of muscular dystro-
phy, which had been destroying his body
since his childhood. Unable to walk, this
disease kept him confined to a wheelchair.

Unfortunately, I know a little bit about
muscular dystrophy because my cousin
Mark died from this disease at the age of
19, when he was a sophomore in college.

Just like DePasquale, my cousin was a
huge sports fan. Without sports, my cousin
might still have lived, but the quality of his
life would have been dramati-
cally different for the worse.
Sports was his love and his rea-
son for living. It seems as
though both DePasquale and my
cousin were both able to enjoy ,
their lives so much more because of their
love of sports and their ability to make a
difference by supporting their colleges’
and their high schools’ sports teams.

Besides being a friend to Pitt’s men’s
and women’s basketball teams,
DePasquale was also a friend of the Pitt
football team. This seemed apparent in a
photo of DePasquale, who posed this year
with Panther football players. This photo
was also printed in the Post—Gazette.

Sometimes students might get into a
rut with their schoolwork, and the goals
that they set for their lives may see, unob-
tainable. They might not realize the impor-
tance of perseverance despite obstacles
that might get in the way of their aspira-
tions. This was not the case with Anthony
DePasquale.

Although doctors told DePasquale that
he would not live past the age of 20, he
still dreamed of one day becoming an
armouncer for Pitt, and of walking again
some day. . -

This makes me think of some high-

MICHELLE

FRIEDMAN

 

school English papers that I was assessing
on Saturday here at Pitt for a project in
conjunction with the School of Education
and the Tri-State Area School Study
Council. Students had to write an essay
based on the following statement:
“Someone once said that success in life is
measured not by how far we go but by the
direction we choose.” ‘
DePasquale was indeed a prime exam-
ple of someone who lived according to this
statement. According to the P-G article,
DePasquale was persistent, outwardly
maintaining a friendly and positive atti-
tude, and he did not give up on his goals
despite the hardship of battling muscular
dystrophy, a disease that slowly atrophies
people’s organs and muscles. Anthony
DePasquale knew what path he wanted to
take in life, and he never lost sight of his
goals. '
Other people who have
muscular dystrophy have their
own personal goals and ambi-
tions for their lives, as well;
they just don’t have as much
time as some of the rest of us do
to realize and accomplish, their dreams.
My cousin died from muscular dystro-
phy after being in a hospital attached to
life support for several months, and we

watched him suffer a slow and an uncom- .

fortable end to his life. This contrasts with
the sudden way that Anthony DePasquale
was taken from us.

My deepest sympathy goes out to
DePasquale’s family and the many friends
he had ‘here at Pitt. I hope and pray that
some day his family might take the small-
est bit of comfort knowing that
DePasquale died suddenly after he had just
cheeredon a Pitt sports team, which was
something that he seemed to love to do.

DePasquale’s life indeed seemed to
represent joy, which he was able to give
and take so beautifully in his short yet
important life. He seemed to have lived by
an expression from which we can all learn:
Carpe Diem! Seize the day! ,

THE PITT NEWS: OPINIONS

  Courtney, say ii cIin'|- so!

Andrea Woessner
Columnist

Hole’s new video, “Malibu,” pre-
miered on MTV recently. I don’t watch
much MTV or much TV in general, but
I sat dumbfounded through the whole
video. Courtney Love, the lead singer
of Hole, is nothing like she used to be.

I know this is nothing new —— I
vaguely remember. glimpsing pictures
of her a while ago on the covers of
inane magazines such as People and Us
and other noxious bird—cage liners.
Though I was mildly shocked at her
sleek, socially acceptable new look, it
obviously didn’t make that big of an
impression on me — the first time
around. It wasn’t until I saw her in
motion that I realized the true tragedy.

I’m not a big Hole fan. I’d proba-
bly recognize a few songs if I heard
them, and I don’t think that Hole is
entirely talentless. It would be unfair to
say that they’re without merit.
However, let’s just say I’m not rushing
out to buy their new CD. I don’t own
any Hole CDs, and I probably never
will. .

That said, I’m really disappointed,
and almost hurt, that Love underwent
such a drastic makeover. While I’m not
a fan, I admired her for not trying to be
conventionally “pretty.”

I liked what she stood for, and I
liked her aggressive spirit. She ﬂew in
the face of all stereotypes about women
and beauty with her matted hair, her
thick,‘ wildly smeared eyeliner, her gash
of bright red or orange lipstick that she
just wouldn’t keep in the “lines” (a la
Robert Smith), her ratty baby-doll
dresses and scuffed Mary b  _
Janes (irony, anyone?) ‘
her torn fishnets and 
most importantly, her 
contemptuous “Go 
ahead, I dare you” sneer. -.5
Everything about her had 
a certain bad-girl air and  
a sort of animal ferocity , ‘
that’s just not “allowed” 
in polite society. I

Courtney Love was
the kind of role model 
for young girls who 
helped to balance out the
inferiority—instilling, suppress—your-

   

 

anger, shut-up—and—look-pretty inﬂu-

ences that pervade our society.
Practically from birth, little girls are
told how to behave and how to appear.
They’re essentially told that if you
don’t look pretty for the boys, you’re
worthless. Everybody knows that this
goes on, and yet nobody has really been
able to ‘do anything about it —— it’s
deeply ingrained in our society, and

it’ll take a lot to eradicate it.

_ But one of the ways society can be
changed is through dynamic public fig-
ures. Everyone knows about the inﬂu-
ence of celebrities on the general pub-
lic. For a recent and obvious example,
just look at everyone’s favorite capital-
ist, Marilyn Manson, and all his silly
 “Spooky Kids.”

" Public figures have an
awesome power, and too
few use their position for
good. If a cultural icon
challenges a culture’s

deas, denounces them
and demonstrates the
“new way,” the culture
will, in time, follow
them. Look at what Elvis
started with a little public
hip-waggling; he chal-
lenged our culture’s con-
cept of sexuality, helping
to kick off the notion that maybe sex
isn’t a shameful thing that should be
confined to dark master bedrooms and
never, ever discussed.

The famous have a great deal of
power to make changes even if that’s
not what they set out to do. If you are in
a position where you’re adored by
many, then your actions can have seri-
ous cultural repercussions; you have a
responsibility to people to stand for

what is good and what is right.

Courtney Love, regardless of
whether she likes it, used to be a pow-
erful force against the archaic and
dated prejudices that still remain in our
society today.

Now, she’s just become another
pretty girl, a bare—it—all-to-get-attention
corporate tool. She retained some of
her aggressive spirit in the “Malibu”
video, so she’s still not “nice” (not yet,
anyway); unfortunately, she’s turned
into such a sexual object that it’s hard
to see anything else in her. She looks
like a naughty Barbie doll, right down
to her wispy, transparent Kleenex of a
dress and her hideous pink lipstick
(which, unfortunately, is neatly
applied). I suppose I shouldn’t be sur-
prisech

What is pure invariably gets mud-
died over time; Elvis died fat and dis-
gusting in his bathroom, the complete
opposite of the sex symbol he once
was. I just hope another riot grrrl
appears soon to take Love’s place — it
would be exciting to witness dramatic
culture change ﬁrsthand.

Andrea Woessner played with her little
brother’s G.I. Joes and Transformers
when she got too irritated with Barbie is

My Little Ponies.

We all need somebody to lien on

James Maude

Oplnlons Edltor

Oh, the games we humans play and the
words we use to play them. The intimate
interaction between male and female; the
terms we coin to apply to various degrees
of interaction — “go outwith,” “have sex
with,” “get engaged to,” “get married to,”
“have an adulterous affair with,” etc.

‘ The sexual semantics of the English
language will not do for me. I’Ve gotten
into trouble several times for misusing
words. “What?” she protested. “We’ve
been going out for three months! Why
don’t you know where we are in our rela-
tionship?” This vagueness will not do. Not
one bit. How do you call someone your
girlfriend/boyfriend, when no ﬁxed scale
has been accorded (i.e., ﬁrst day to ﬁrst
month: casual date; second month to ﬁrst
year: boyfriend/girlfriend etc. Or for those
of you who are very possessive, the
moment you ask someone out equals the
moment you attach the tag “girlfriend.”)?

So, in lieu of established terminology,
I will attempt to create my own. For all
intents and purposes, these are what I con-
sider to be suitable synonyms for the
ambiguous word “date.”

lien v. 2. [derived from actress Jennifer
Lien (“Star Trek Voyager,” “American

History X’ ’)] To have sex with member of
the opposite sex on the ﬁrst date.

The ﬁrst deﬁnition of “lien” (I was
shocked to ﬁnd one), is a noun meaning “a
claim on the property of another as securi-
ty for the payment of a just debt”
(Webster’s New World College
Dictionary). But in light of a current fasci-
nation with the blue—eyed, blond Lien, who
seems to play shy, restrained and intelligent
characters (such as _ Kes on “Star Trek
Voyager,” who was engaged to Neelix, a
character who looked like a rainbow trout),
I thought she’d be a good choice upon
which someone could base a dictionary
deﬁnition. I wouldn’t mind liening Ms.
Lien myself, actually. .. =

With “lien” in our vocabulary, guys
would have an easier time talking to each
other about women.

“‘S’like, we liened and all this stuff
like that,” says Schlong to his friends. In
celebration, Schlong drinks another forty.

The words “date” and ‘ —k” have
been fused into one word: lien. Simple
enough yet? Time for another.

carrera v. [derived from porn star Asia
Carrera] to have anal sex with member of
the opposite sex on the ﬁrst date.

‘ Carreraing is a trend growing in popu-
larity. Guys and girls with a propensity for
liening are also.prone to carreraing. It does-

n’t occur too often in the United States, but
caireraing is a regular ﬁrst date experience
in Brazil, mainland Europe, Southeast
Asia, South Africa and Australia.

noyb v. [abbrv. “none of your busi-
ness”] to have gone on any date and to dis-
close to others that the date took place but
not divulge any personal details.

Whether you liened or carreraed, it’s
OK to noyb. It is sometimes important to
keep events under wraps. Why tell people
things you don’t want them to know? If
you want to keep intimate details of what
you and your date or girlfriend did, feel free
to say you noybed.

tudor v. [derived from Mary Tudor,
Queen of England from 1553 to 1558] 3.
To have gone on a date and not done any-
thing signiﬁcant.

“So Schlong, what did you and Amy

do last night?” asks Adrian. “Like a bour— I

geois capitalist, did you wine and dine, then
usurp power unto yourself and have sex

with her? Did you lien?”
“No,” replies Schlong. “S’1ike, we
tudored and all this stuff like that.”

“That’s too bad, hom ,” says Roy.
“You are having bad luck with the women.
You should wear more green shirts. You

' had an intuition about Amy, but I guess that

didn’t work out.” _
Tudoring is synonymous with the old-

fashioned tenn “courting,” except that
courting was not strictly deﬁned as a date
without sex; it just happened to be that way.

tokolosh v. [derived from the
Tokoloshe, a small Southern African
demon with an insatiable sexual appetite]
to go out on a date expecting sex but not
getting any. ,

“No expectation, no disappointment”
are regular words of wisdom from Roy.
That is why for most men, tokoloshing a
girl is heartbreaking. Guys with these
appetites, of course, generally have no
respect for their dates, so they’re generally
dumped after the ﬁrst tokolosh. Why
should sex be be compulsory on ﬁrst dates
these days, anyway? In a self-respecting
person’s-twist on my dictionary, it’s better
to tokolosh and tudor than it is to lien and
carrera

Before I get canied ‘away by these
crazy thoughts, I will end this infernal mess
by saying that we Westerners are limited by
the language we choose to describe acts of
sex and love. Signiﬁcant overlaps and trite
euphemisms explain this. But whatever the
word, whatever the occasion, action speaks
louder than words.

James Maude, being English, sometimes

‘has a shaky command of the English lan-

guage.

The first annual
Yander awards

Boy, was I wrong! Go ahead, you can
say it — that Jay Yander is an idiot.

My previous colurrm tore through the
basketball team like Hurricane Mitch tore
through a small Guatemalan village. The
Pitt men’s basketball team went on a victory
barrage over Thanksgiving break and
showed me up —— big time. They beat then-
No. 4 Kentucky and then-No. 10 Xavier.

And all of a sudden, the Panthers were
rankedinthetop25 fortheﬁrsttime since
1993. My apologies go out to Ralphy and
the boys for such harsh words. My pen can
be quite aciirnonious at times.

But tliat’s not wlmt .I’m here to talk
about today. It’s time for the ﬁrst Yander’s
Choice Awards. Mixed within these sarcas-
tic prizes, you also will ﬁnd some legitimate
awards.

Ladies and gentlemen, the envelope,

Most Stagnant Offense — the Pitt
Panthers’ football offensive squad. Will
somebody please draw a few new plays for
these guys? I’ve been here for ﬁve seasons
and memorized the whole playbook They
can suit me up, for crying out loud.

Most Overlooked Pitt Team — men’s
swimming and diving. Head coach Chuck
Knoles has done awonderful job with the
defending back—to—back Big East champs.
This year, tliey’re again the team to beat in
the conference.

Paul Evans Look-Alike (from
behind) Award —. Ralph Willard. Check
this out for yourself at the next game.
Ralphy sure looks like the former Pitt coach
ﬁorn behind (Hint: It partly has to do with
Ralph’s head). You may even say Willard
looks like Evans when he’s sitting, arms-
crossed, on the bench.

Most Unnotioed Pitt All-Americans
— wrestling. As long as I’ ve been here, head
coach Randy Stottlemyer has produced
multiple All-Americans every year. Pitt bas-
ketball and football can’t say that

Most Embarrassing Political

Cyrus Zolghadii was ready for the sum-
mer to begin. In the otf-season, he planned
an exciting internship in New York city and
a chance to teach young kids about his ﬁrst
true love: tennis. _

He had just ﬁnished his junior year at
Pitt and was looking forward to his ﬁnal sea-
son under head coach George Dielfenbach
and possibly a future somehow related to his
favorite sport.

All of that changed when he opened his
mail less than one week after returning home
to spend some time with his mother in
Vuginia before moving to New York

A letter from then-Athletics Director
Oval Jaynes changed the way Zolghadri
would look at tennis for the rest of his life.

In fomial letters, every member of the
men’s tennis and gynmastics tearris were
informed that their programs would no
longer exist at the University of Pittsburgh.

  

This move was elfective immediately.
This sent shock waves through the

respective programs. Athletes who chose to ‘

pursue their sports careers were going to be
forced to do that elsewhere. This meant
transferring, not an easy move with less than
four months remaining ‘until the next acade-
mic year.

“It was very strange reading that letter. It
was all like a very bad dream,” Zolghadri
said as he re-read the letter.

(“I remember seeing the envelope and
thinking it was a letter of thanks from Mr.
Jaynes or something like that, but when I got
to the end, I just stood there and wondered
what I was going to do-. I knew I could sur-
vive without tennis, but I felt horrible for the
guys on the team that were freshmen or
sophomores. What were they going to do?
How could they possibly transfer this late in
the year? The whole situation left a bad taste
in the mouths of everyone involved. I don’t
think many of the coaches or players will
ever forgive Pitt for doing what they di ”

Like thousands of other weighﬂifters in
America, Pitt senior Greg D’Eramo has
been swallowed up by the whirlwind of
advenisements for the vogue supplement
androstene.

As he sits inthe Wrlliarn Pitt Union, he
expresses no great fear when asked about
androstene’s side effects, which include
aggressive behavior, testicular atrophy, acne,
water retention and possibly liver cancer.

He simply runs his hand though his
head of thick, dark hair and shrugs.

“My biggest wony is baldness,” he said
“I don’t want to become sterile either.”

A month ago, the Pit senior heard about
androstene from a friend in the Marines. So

D’Eramo and his friend were supplied with

androstene, and they are now a month into a -

new workout with the supposed wonder
substance. '
“In the month I’ve been taking andro, I
think I did get stronger,” D’Eramo said

Unfortunately, this piece of legislation
that President Richard Nixon signed in 1972
didn’t immediately make moves like the one
involving Pitt’s men’s tennisand gyrrmastics
teams a reality. Tiﬂe IX has endured a long
road to get where it stands today.

Shortly after the legislation was passed,
the National Collegiate Athletic Association
made its opinion clear. They claimed that a
drastic cut in funding for rr1en’s college ath-
letics, or an increase in frmding for women’s
programs, would hint the overall success of
intercollegiate athletics.

Federal regulations on how to fully
comply with Tiﬂe IX took nearly tliiee years
to be available at all participating institutions.
The government agency in charge of seeing
that the law was enforced, the Department of
Education, acted slowly when it came to
hearing cases based on ﬂie new law.

made. Then, in 1984, those in favor of Tiﬂe
IX were dealt yet another crushing blow. The
Supreme Court’s decision in the Grove City
vs. Bell case nearly destroyed the foundation
of the legislation.

Citing the fact that the institution con-
sistently refused state and federal funding,
University oﬁicials refused to comply with
the Title IX restrictions.

The courts . cited the Basic Education
Opportunity Grants that Grove City students
were awarded and decided that they did fall
under the umbrella of federal funding, and
the school would have to comply. However,
the school did have the right, which it even-

many unanswered questions about its eﬂ°ec-

The popularity of the drug has skyrock-
eted since Mark McGwire admitted using it
this summer (andro is legal in Major Legue
Baseball).

Not only are ﬂie dosages and types of

as well. Though the drug itself boasts excel-
lent results and is totally natural, there have
been no conclusive studies done on it

So just what is it, and how exactly does
it work?

’ Andro, a potent anabolic steroid, is pro-

_ duced endogenously in small quantities in

the adrenal glands and gonads. It is convert-
ed by the liver to testosterone, an even more

potent androgen.

program and not be bound by the Title IX
regulations.

This case, along with dozens more,
were lostina seaof red tape, and many were
eventually dropped or forgotten. Even
worse, those that did make it to the end were
often halted by roadblocks similar to that
involving Grove City and eventually lost as
well.

Less than four years later, a move was
made that would start the Title IX ball rolling
yet again, this time in a new direction.

Despite an attempted veto by then-
President Ronald Reagan, Congress passed a
bill that reversed the Grove City decision.

The Civil Rights Restoration Act stated
that any institution that received even the
slightest amount of federal aid at any time
was to be judged under Title IX. The Ofﬁce
of Civil Rights in Washington, D.C, even
wentas faras tolabelT1tleIXcases “top pri-

tive damages.

A Allthetalkaboutequalitywas great,but
what were schools going to do when the

' backbones of their athletic departments were

put in jeopardy?

Kelly Meters, captain of Pitt’s women’s
volleyball tearrr, agrees that Title IX did have
negative elfects.

“I think that Title IX, unfortunately, was
a necessary evil developed to bring about
gender equity in sports,” she said.
“However, we [athletes] have not forgotten

about those teams that have been dele ”

Zolghadri was one of the ﬁrst to be hurt
by Pittsburgh’s move toward compliance,
but every dark cloud has a silver lining. That
lining came in the fonn of two new women’s
programs at Pittsburgh.

Led by head coach Roland Sturk, the
women’s soccer program debuted in the fall
of 1996 and in two seasons of conference
play has become a Big East contender.
Softball, which ﬁrst took to the diamond last
spring, will begin its ﬁrst season of Big East
play this March.

“Was Title IX the best way to improve
women’s programs across the country?”
Sturk reiterated when asked the same ques-
tion. “Yes, I think it is because schools have
had absolutely no initiative to work on this,
and without legislation like this it’s hard to
ﬁnd an equal level of participation in sports
on all levels.”

Sturk realized that some people have to
suﬁer when it comes to full compliance, but
said the law is the law and it must be fol-
lowed.

dragging their feet with compliance, but I

- really thinkPittsburgh is headed in the right

direction,” he continued. “We have added
two exciting programs, one of which I have
beneﬁtted directly from, and in conjunction
with Steve Pederson and the Athletic
Department’s desire to make all of our pro-
grams exemplary ones in the Big East, it’s
clear we are headed in the right way.”

Does this change only the college gain
for female athletes? '

A woman would spend most of her life
practicing day in and day out to be the best
she could be at her sport. All of the late nights
and road trips only to see those playing days
end at the high school or, if she was lucky,
the college level.

Professional opportunities for women in
sports were an endangered species for most
of this century.

Female athletes growing up did have
some idols, such as Billie Jean King, Wilma
Rudolph and Chris Evert—Lloyd, butmales
still dominated the world of professional
sports. The jerseys female athletes
unwrapped on Christmas morning were
adorned with names such as Jordan,
Montana and Lernieux.

That is not always the case now.

The Jordan jersey has been replaced by
that of New York Liberty center Rebecca
Lobo.

The Joe Montana poster has been
replaced by a shot of Mia Harnrn knocking
in another goal for Team USA.

Last year’s Lernieux fan is now a
Hayley \V1ckenhauser admirer.

Hayley who?

.  . E7» 9

Hayley Wickenhauser, ‘the 19-year-old
American who led the USA squad to a silver
medal at the 1998 Winter Olympics, is con-
sidered one of the best female _hockey play-
ers in the world, and she showed it this sum-
mer.

For nine days, Wickenhauser donned
the black, orange and white of the
Philadelphia Flyers and took her shots at
Lindros, LeClair and company. A

For nine days she was one of the guys,
but that wasn’t the point. In an excerpt from
her journal written for CBS Sportsline, she
commented on her intentions heading into
camp, saying she ‘

“My intentions heading into camp were
not to make the Philadelphia Flyers or create
a media circus, rather just to becorrre abetter
player,” she explained. “To do that you have
to compete with better players.”

This experience will likely give the 19-
year—old phenom an added advantage this
season in the WPI-IL, the newest female
hockey league. ,

The ﬁve-team league dropped its ﬁrst
puck Oct. 18, and despite low attendance
and a lack of media attention, the league is
alive and has high hopes for next season.

Thanks to the growing popularity of
women’s basketball, the WPHL has arrived
at a good time — time when more and more
women are playing, and watching their peers
compete on a professional level. .

In the early ‘90s, the road from college
to professional sports for women was a long

and arduous one with many athletes fallen A

Rivers Stadium. Could there be anything
more aesthetically displeasing than this hunk
of cement? Plus, you have to be among all of
those yinzers.

Nicest Sabbatical from Crap — the
NBA lockout. It’s been so nice not to hear
anything pertaining to NBA game highlights
on “Spor1:sCenter.” I am truly sick of hearing
about all of the trash—talking that goes on
during an NBA contest. The only place that
has more trash than the NBA is the streets of
Oakland.

Sports Leagues Most Likely to
Disband — ABL and WNBA. These gals
need to merge quickly, or it’s lights out for
both of them. There simply is not a market
for a professional women’s basketball

league, let alone two. I mean, really — unless '

the ladies look like Heather Locklear, I cer-

tainly don’t want to watch this traditionally

slow and deliberate game.

City Most Likely to be Without a
Professional Sports Team Within Five
Years — Pittsburgh. Sony to say this, but if
the public oﬂicials of Pittsburgh, Allegheny
County, and the state of Pennsylvania don’t
wake up, the city is going to be without a
professional team very soon. The Pens are
broke, and the Bucs and the Steelers deserve
better. My advice to Mayor Murphy —— you

shouldn’t have oifered stadium funding and
decided later that Plan B may not work Give

but it hasn’t even gotten to Plan A yet.
Greatest Aspect of Sports — the
upset. The upset is a beautiful thing in sports.
I spent this past Saturday watching the
underdogs Miami and Texas A&M thrash
the national title hopes of UCLA and Kansas
State. But there isn’t a better stage for upsets
than the NCAA basketball tournament in
March. Where else can a Middle Tennessee
State beat a more talented Duke team?
There’s nothing quite like rooting for the
underdog. It makes us feel like anything can
happen. Even marrying Jennifer Love

The Only Thing Missing from College
Football — a playoff system. This Bowl

with the blowhards who make up the voting
panel of the AP and the coaches’ poll. For all
I know, Walt Hanis voted his Panﬂrers No. 9
this week. Sony, Coach, Pitt is at best atop-

careers in athletics were relegated to coach-
ing, playing overseas or watching as a chap-
ter of their lives came to an abrupt end

That all changed almost faster than you
can say WNBA or ABL.

These dueling women’s basketball
leagues have sparked an interest throughout
the world, helping to inﬂuence ad cam-
paigns, pushing female athletes closer to
their once lofty goals, and making a lasting
impression on the way women’s athletics
will be viewed

Traci Waites, in her ﬁrst season as head
coach of the lady Panﬂiers basketball team,
agreesvvithtlreideathatinmostcases the
doors to a future in sports were closed to
women after college.

“Women are now getting the same jobs
and resources as men when it comes to col-
lege and professional arenas. These pro
leagues that are popping up in all sports, not
just basketball, for women are long over-
due,” she said

Waites stressed that these budding pro-
fessional opportunities for women not only
affect mature athletes who can come out of
school and make a career out of sports, but
also are important at the grassroots level by
creating more motivation for younger ath-
letes to earn scholarships, etc.

Having played for Montcgna in Italy
following her college career, Waites under-
stands the importance opportunities in the
United States can have for an athlete coming
right out of college. .

“When I went to Italy, I didn’t have any
family or ﬁiends there, and it was a big tran-
sition,” said Waites. “By getting a chance to

port system that didn’t exist abroad”

. . . - . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . » . . . . .

The University of Pittsburgh adrninis—
tration and Pederson have made amazing
strides toward making Pittsburgh one of the
solid contenders in women’s athletics.

“All of the women’s programs are on
the rise, and that will show when we start
having players make it to the next level; a
level that is so brand new,” said Waites.

Just as Waites is excited about the
growth of the WNBA and the ABL for her
players, Sturk feels that the rise of women’s
soccer in the U.S. has fed the sport’s popu-
larity worldwide.

“VV1th the Women’s World Cup in 1999,
and plans for an eight—team league around
2000 or 2001, the future of women’s soccer

looks great,” said" Sturk “It will all come .

down to a matter of sponsorship support, and
the ability to get off the ground Just like in
any arena, the bottom line, unfortunately, is
money. If the league starts and there is no
sponsorship, TV revenue or spectators it
won’t last long.’’

The Mattel Corporation has also caught
on to the rapidly gowing sport with its line
of Women’s World Cup Barbie dolls that
willbeintroducedearlynextyear. T h i s
new Barbie isn’t Mattel’s ﬁrst venture into
the sporting industry. They also produce a
WNBA and Olympic Skater line of prod-
UCS.

basketball, hockey and soccer, other sports
such as volleyball and softball aren’t too far

'I'I

  ANDRO

FROM PAGE 8

Testosterone, the male sex hormone, is
responsible for giving males characteristics
such as body hair, voice tone and build

By taking andro in caplets — typically
100 milligrams (the size of a large cold pill)

. at roughly $23 a bottle — manufacturers

claim it boosts the body’s testosterone level
within minutes, creating a testosterone
“spike” that lasts up to three hours.

Mark Kelsch, Pennsylvania sales repre-
sentative for Achieve Total Fitness ‘in
Oakmont, has been lifting for seven years
and also takes andro.

“I take it an hour before workouts and
around eight in the evening,” he said “Most
peopletakeituptoth1eetimesaday.Itis all
up to you.”

The dosage is based on the comfort
level of the user. The maximum recom-
mended dosage is three times daily, but that
amount may not be necessary depending on
body size. Smaller dosages may decrease the
risk of side effects. ~

D’Eramo takes two dilferent types of
andro, taken in combination, that are said to
produce a longer level of testosterone
“spikes”.

D’Eramo wants to eventually move on
to Nor-Androstene, which is even more
potent. Nor-Androstene is so potent users
can test positive on illegal steroid tests while
taking it. ’

Kelsch said andro has been around for a
while, ‘but was never really publicized until
last year when the East German Swim team
admitted to using it throughout the ‘60s, ‘70s
and ‘80s.

Andro is marketed as a dietary supple-
ment for those seeking to build muscle. Due
to a 1994 law, the Food and Drug
Administration does not test dietary sub-
stances as it would over—tl1e-counter drugs.

This law results in the lack of studies
done on the subject

In the United States, the only study on
record is a 1962 test completed at the
Medical College of Georgia on only four
women. A study done in Germany stated that
when snorted, andro could raise testosterone.
levels 237 percent.

So, if there is really no conclusive
research on the substance, what about the
side effects?

D’Eramo said he really isn’t wonied
about the side effects now, but he is aware
that possible ones exist. Since andro is'con—
verted to testosterone in the liver, in large
doses it may be connected to causing liver
cancers in users just 10 years down the road.

Faster-occuning side effects in adults
include aggressive behavior, testicular atro-
phy, acne and water retention.

Kelsch is not wonied about the side
effects either. He explained studies of the
effects are not very conclusive, and he has
found a way to prevent them from occurring.

He said he supplements the herbs

Palmetto, Chrysin and Zinc with his dosages ‘

of androstene, which he says helps reduce
any side effects.

Despite potential risks, Kelsch says the
sales of his products haven’t declined —
rather, they have increased This increase, he
said, was due in part to McGwire’s admis-
sion of his use of andro.

“When the ﬁrst story of McGwire’s use

came out, the next day we set a record for
sales,” he said.

Pitt junior Jeff Irwin, lifter and former
andro user, quit because he he found himself
suffering severe bouts of edginess. ‘

He said that after taking it for three
weeks, though his energy level was incredi-
ble and he had excellent concentration dur-
ing workouts, the side effects bothered him.

“I was very edgy,” he said “I would just
snap on people.”

The most severe side damage from
andro can occur if it’s taken during puperty.

According to Dr. Gary Wadler, a New
York sports physician and a consultant to the
U.S. Department on anabolic—androgenic
steroid abuse, most teenagers who take the
supplement have not gone through the surge
in testosterone that happens during adoles-

_cence, therefore anything raising testos-
terone levels will have a serious impact.

He said younger people who are
exposed to testosterone suddenly will have
great levels of muscular development; how-
ever, the prices ﬂiey pay are not only the pos-
sible side elfects mentioned above, but more
serious ones such as permanently stunted
growth caused by the premature closing of
the growth plates in their long bones. '

For these younger users, the supplement
can also be converted into the female sex
honnone, estrogen. This causes breast
enlargement in younger subjects.

Kelch said he does not sell any andro
products to any customer under the age of 21
because he believes it is unethical.

Though his company prohibits selling
the supplement to minors, others don’t,
including the Colorado—based Experimental

.\e°

and Applied Sciences, which has a Web site
that is accessible by all.

g An ESPN report claims many high
school students take the supplement because

they believe it helps them compete with.

other athletes and enhances their chances to
make it into college athletics. This new craze
leaves many of the student’s coaches guess-
ing, because most of them have had little to
no experience with the supplement.

The 6 million teens who do take the
supplement are simply left alone to ﬁgure
out whether substances such as andro are
safe or even effective. The National
Federation of High School Associations took
a stance against andro just before the school
year, but the group has no power to set and
enforce policy.

The decision-making is up to individual
school districts, most of which know little to
nothing of the substance.

Similar inconsitency exsits at the major
sport level. Androis banned in the NFL and
NCAA, but not in the NBA, NHL, or Major
League Baseball.

So many questions still remain over the
controversial substance androstenedione.
Though it is a natural supplement, it has the
same effects as anabolic steroids.

In a Denver Post column on Aug. 27,
1998, Bill Bryan, a team physician for the
Houston Astros, said he doesn’t believe nat-
ural is necessarily good

“People say androstenedione is natural,
so it can’t be that bad. That blows my mind

, Nicotine is natural. Turpentine is a natural

substance. Arsenic is natural. But that does.-

n’t make it good to put into your body,” he .
