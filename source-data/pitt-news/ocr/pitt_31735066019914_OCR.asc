Giant
Eagle

closing

averted

By Scot Ross

News Editor

After an extensive meeting with

a group of Oakland citizens“

representatives of the Giant Eagle
supermarket, located at 3440
Forbes Avenue, said yesterday
that the supermarket will remain
open.

The group, Oakland Directions
lnc., is comprised of Oakland
Planning and Development, Fa-
mily House, the South Oakland
Citizen's Council and other
health and educational organiza-
tions in Pittsburgh.

Reportedly, profit loss over the
last few years due to shoplifting
was one of the reasons for the
proposed move to close the su-
permarket.

The basic cause of concern
among the parties involved was
that, as the Giant Eagle serves as
South Oakland's only food mar-
ket, the community would be
without an easily accessible
grocery store.

At a meeting held yesterday,
Giant Eagle representatives Ray-
mond Huber, the vice president
for Personnel and Labor Rela-
tions; Charity Imbrie, vice presi-
dent and general counsel; and
Bernadette Baker, regional
manager, met with Oakland
Direction and compromised on a
series of actions that would take
place at the Giant Eagle over the
next few months.

The. first step will be for Giant

Unsuccessful transplant results in lawsuit

By Blake DePastino

For The Pitt News

One year after an unsuccessful
heart transplant operation at
Presbyterian-University Hospital,
a patient’s family filed a negli-
gence suit in U.S. District Court.

Michael L. Hild of Englewood,
Ohio is suing the hospital, trans-

plant surgeon Dr. Alfredo Trento '

and the
Procurement

Transplant Organ
Foundation of

Western Pennsylvania, claiming
that his wife, Teresa Lynn,
received a defective replacement
heart.

Mr’. Hild and his three children
seek compensation for their grief,
claiming that Trento and the
hospital should have been aware
of the allegedly poor quality of
the transplant organ before the
operation.

Teresa Lynn Hild was 31 when
she died June 24, 1986, the day

after the transplant surgery.
Executive Director Brian Braz-
nick of the Organ Procurement
Foundation, the organization
responsible for acquiring the
donor heart from Froedert
Memorial Lutheran Hospital in
Milwaukee, declined comment
on the suit, adding that the Foun-
dation had not yet been served
any papers. The only word Braz-
nick had received on the filing,
he said, was from a news brief in
last Saturday's Pittsburgh Press.

Presbyterian-University Hospi-
tal media correspondent Susan
Ruth also refused official com-
ment, saying only that it is ”stan~
dard for the hospital not to
comment on cases like that”and
explaining that discussion would
not be proper during litigation.

Trento, who performed the
transplant operation June 23,
1986, is said to be out of town
and unavailable for comment un-
til the end of July.

‘Summerfest’ offers disabled enjoyable social interaction

By Keri D. Smith
Staff Writer

The physically impaired got a
chance to beat the summer dol-
drums at a Summerfest Monday
night in the William Pitt Union.
Information was offered about
community— related recreational
and social activities for the han-
dicapped.

Judy Schiffbauer, patient serv-
ices coordinator of the Myasthe-
nia Gravis Association, organized
the Summerfest. ”|t’s a social
party to introduce people with
physical and medical impair-
ments to organizations in Pitts-
burgh that offer social and
recreational outlets for the han-

dicapped. There are a lot of ter-
rific organizations that provide
these opportunities, but people
just don't know about them.”
According to Schiffbauer, the
interaction of these groups with
the handicapped is geared
towards creating a social at-
mosphere for the disabled. ”This
started out with a dozen organi-
zations involved. The Myasthenia
Gravis Association, I work with
them, the Multiple Sclerosis So-
ciety, Harmarville Rehabilitation
Society, just to name a few. They
all kind of pitched together
cooperatively to get their patients
involved,” she said.
Schiffbauer would like to see
some solid social relationships

evolve as a result. She stated, ”lt’s

good to have friends and to have ‘

people get involved. It's good for
the self- esteem of the han-
dicapped.”

Many of the disabled used the
Summerfest to get informative
pamphlets and booklets that
prove quite useful.

’’I’m giving out pamphlets and
answering questions on the ther-
apy and ‘recreation program,”
said Diane Babin, who works at
Citiparks Therapy and Recreation
Program. ”We h_ave a variety of
leisure activities programmed for
the mentally retarded and physi-
cally handicapped.  It's very
successful. It provides them an
outlet to do things socially and

recreationally as well as athlet-
ical|y.”

Access provided information
such as a map of downtown and
sidewalk ramps in Oakland.
Project Ace offered information
concerning therapeutic activities,
how to attend a clinic by Crime
Prevention for the Handicapped
and how to become a member of
the National Handicapped Sports
and Recreation Association. The
Center for Independent Living
contributed information on coun-
seling, housing consortium and
attendant care. Much more infor-
mation was available about
camps and parks and a variety’ of
other events and services availa-
ble to the handicapped.

’’I got a flier in the mail,” said
Tom Williams, a disabled Pitts-
burgh resident. ’’It seems nice.”

Williams said that before he
heard about Summerfest he just
sat at home and worked on his
computer. « He said Summerfest

gave him a chance to meet peo-

ple: ”l was getting bored just sit-
ting at home doing nothing.”
Asked whether he had signed up
for recreational activities or
volunteer work with the various
sponsors, Williams said he didn't
know about them. ”|’|| have to
check those out.” , -

Also there was Ethel Newsome
who provided information about
the Square Wheelers. ”Square

Heidnik’s jury begins deliberation in niurder trial

_ PHILADELPHIA —— Torture-
murder ‘suspect Gary Michael
Heidnik looked straight ahead at
the judge, ignoring the jury, as his
lawyer argued Tuesday that Heid-
nik was insane when he chained
up six women in his house, kill-
ing two and sawing apart one
body.

The prosecutor argued Heidnik
wasn't crazy because ”he knew
what he was doing and he knew
it was wrong.”

”This man conducted repeated
sadistic acts on six defenseless
persons,” said Assistant District
Attorney Charles Gallagher about
the women Heidnik lured to his
basement and kept captive in

chains. ”What he did was
premeditated, deliberate
murder.”

Defense attorney A. Charles
Peruto, Jr. said repeatedly that his
client ”is insane.”

”He is suffering from
schizophrenia, a major mental ill-
ness,” Peruto said.-

The comments came in closing
arguments by opposing attorneys
in a sixth-floor City Hall cour-
troom where a jury, chosen in
Pittsburgh because of pretrial
publicity here, will be given in-
structions to begin deliberations
Wednesday.

Peruto and Gallagher each

took 45 minutes to sum up their
case on the seventh day of the tri-
al before Common Pleas Judge
Lynne Abraham.

The bearded Heidnik, wearing
the black, flowered Hawaiian-
style sport shirt he has worn ev-
ery day except Monday, ignored
the lawyers’ rhetoric.

Navy captain killed

by car explosion

ATHENS, Greece (AP) —— The
U.S. military attache in Greece
was killed Tuesday on the street
where he lived by a bomb in a
parked car that blew his armor-
plated car off the road as he drove
to work.

The Pentagon confirmed the at-
tack and identified him as Navy
Capt. William E. Nordeen.

There was no immediate claim
of responsibility for the blast, but
senior police officials said they
believed it to be the work of
November 17, a left—wing urban
terrorist group.

‘I Nordeen was serving as the U.S.
defense attache as well as the
naval attache to Greece.

Police bomb experts said the
device was detonated by ”some
kind of remote-control radio
device.” They said the bomb was
apparently planted in the trunk of
a Japanese sub-compact.

NEWS BRIEFS

The group November 17 has
claimed responsibility for 11 as-
sassinations since 1975, includ-
ing the 1983 shooting of U.S.
Navy Capt. George Tsantes and
the 1975 assassination of Richard
Welch, CIA station chief in
Athens.

Bill outlaws steroid

use in high schools
HARRISBURG (AP) —- A bill that
would outlaw the use of anabol-
ic steroids by high school ath-
letes, prevent strip searches at
schools and further regulate
home schooling was approved
Tuesday by the House Education
Committee.

The omnibus bill, which was
approved unanimously, now
goes before the full House for
consideration.

Committee members defeated
several amendments, including
one that would have banned
smoking in public school
buildings.

The bill, sponsored by Rep.‘

Ron Cowell, an Allegheny
County Democrat who chairs the
committee, stipulates that parents
who teach their children at home

must provide at least 180 days of
instruction totaling at least 900
hours at the elementary level and
990 hours at the secondary level.

Specific course requirements
and remedial programs are also
spelled out in the legislation.

The committee also approved
a bill that would call for dismis-
sal of any public school em-
ployee convicted of delivering
drugs or possessing them with in-
tent to deliver.

House investigates

Meese’s use of jet
WASHINGTON (AP) —~ Edwin
Meese’s frequent use of an FBI jet
is under scrutiny by a House sub-
committee chairman who says
the attorney general may have

‘ violated President Reagan's man-

date to hold down travel costs.

Rep. Glenn English, D-Ok|a.,
has directed the General Ac-
counting Office, the investigative
wing of Congress, to attempt to
cut through a shroud of secrecy
the FBI and Justice Department
have placed over Meese’s travels.

Between June 3, 1986, and
May 11, 1987, Meese used an
FBI airplane on 40 occasions,
compared to 37 trips by the FBI
and other Justice officials, accord-
ing to a House Government

Music and peace featured at Schenley Summit

By Mark R. Brown

J Contributing Editor

America's most liveable city
played host to the American-
Soviet Peace Walk last Sunday.
They came to Schenley Park to
relax and picnic, exchanging
conversation and friendship, sym-
bolizing the spirit of trust that
seems to be growing between
America and the Soviet Union.

The events up at the Schenley
Park Overlook — called the Pitts-
burgh Rock and Roll Summit —
went on for more than 10 hours
Sunday. Eight bands — two of
them Russian — and over 100
different organizations participat-
ed. The event was emceed by
KDKA radio announcer Trish
Beatty. ”The whole show came
off beautifully,” said Beatty.
”There’s some entire Russian fa-
milies on the walk, and from here
they go on to lowa. Despite some
delays, everything went fine. A
lot of Pittsburghers came out to
meet the walkers.” Beatty was in
Moscow last year for a peace

march there and has since visit-
ed Nicaragua.

Approximately 220 Soviet
citizens and 150 Americans par-
ticipated in the walk. Yuri Ka|in’s
English wasn't very fluent, but he
explained that he had been walk-
ing for peace in the United States
for a month now, as well as walk-
ing from Leningrad to Moscow.
‘'1 am very glad to see goodwill
in American people,” said Kalin,
who liked Pittsburgh and found
it very beautiful.

A variety of groups were
present near the 60—odd tents
which had been pitched. The
Pittsburgh Conference on Soviet
Jewry had an information drive
going that day. According to Faith
Weinstein, coordinator for that
group, ’’I just wanted the Soviet
people here to know that there’s
another side to Soviet reality. Hu-
man rights are a prerequisite to
world peace.”

One of the bands which played
at the ”summit” was Vettz, which
is comprised partially ofVietnam
veterans from Ohio. They played

July tribute slated

In honor of the late mayor of
Pittsburgh Richard S. Caliguiri,
Citiparks has planned a Fourth of
July weekend event entitled
”Celebrate Pittsburgh.”

The past few years, Citiparks
sponsored a one-day celebration
for Independence Day; however,
officials felt that this year they
would extend the festivities and
dedicate such to the passing of
Caliguiri.

The program will begin Friday,
July 1, with a Vintage Motor Car
parade and display and a Pitts-
burgh Symphony concert.

On the following day, enter-

tainment will include computer-
ized musical performances by Joe
Negri, another Pittsburgh Sym-
phony concert and a hotair bal-
loon race.

July 3, Pepsi, WLTJ and The
Allstar Jeep/Eagle Dealers will
sponsor a concert by The Fifth
Dimension.

And on the Fourth, the Pitts—
burgh Symphony will be high-
lighted again as they perform
”Fourth of July Spectacular.”
Also, Zambelli International Fire-
works will light up the sky in the
evening with their delightful and
renowned display.

some period music from the Viet-
nam era, capping it off with their
own song, ”The Wall,” which
refers to the Vet's Memorial in
Washington D.C. Vettz’s
manager, Gregory Roberson,
said, ”People who want peace

-the most are the ones who have

experienced war.” At the end of
”The Wall,” members of the au-
dience were encouraged to tell
the audience the names of friends
or loved ones who were killed in
Vietnam. With helicopter sound
effects produced by their key-
board, it was an emotional ex-
perience.

Roberson related that Vettz,

who has a video and a 45 out,
has had problems finding a label
for their LP, which they hope to
have released by August. ”|t’s
okay to sing tunes about drinking,
drugs, wife beating, infidelity,
that's okay. But Vettz has been
called controversial. Figure that
out.” Roberson also said that part
of their proceeds are donated to
Vietnam Vets of America, which
in turn helps disabled and needy

. veterans.

Most of the Soviet citizens on
the march spoke English. Kate, a
21-year-old linguistics student
from Kiev, in the Ukraine, is a
singer with the folk group

Ukrainochka. ”l have only been
in the [United States] for nine
days,” she said, and had only ar-
rived in Pittsburgh that day. Did
she miss home? She smiled and
said, ”Not yet.”

As an orange and pink sunset
silhouetted Pittsburgh's unique
skyline, members from different
bands got back on stage for some
rhythym and blues. ”We’re the
Blues Defense |nitiative,” said

one of the singers to the au-

dience; then they rambled into
”Let Peace Roll Like a River.” As
the sun set, one got a feeling that
there was something more to
hope for tomorrow.

 

Disabled

Continued from page 1

Wheelers is an organization
about people in wheelchairs and
we square dance.  it got start-
ed about three years ago to give
people in a wheelchair some-
thing to do besides just straight
exercise. Not everybody has an
electric wheelchair and not
everybody can push themselves
like me. People come who will
push us and it's a nice syn-
chronized affair.  It gave me an
extracurricular activity to belong
to that you got to meet people
and it helped you to be more lov-
ing and giving of yourself to other
people.”

According to Schiffbauer, the
concept of getting the han-
dicapped involved with commu-
nity services was started by Susan
Harper. ’’It was to overcome the
isolation and the loneliness," said
Harper. ’’I thought it was a shame
that agencies didn't come
together.

”We started out contacting
about 30 agencies and maybe a
handful carry most of it. I'm with
the National Multiple Sclerosis
Society and they do a lot. But
tonight a lot of the work was
done by Myasthenia Gravis.”

Also sponsoring the Summer-
fest was the Office of Veterans
and Disabled Student Services of
Pitt. One of their employees, Sa-
bina Bilder, was helping out.
”When they approached me, it
was about recreational activities
for the handicapped and that's a
good place to meet anybody,
whether you're handicapped or
not. It seems like a natural out-
growth of being together.”

Free refreshments were given
at the Summerfest and there was
entertainment to be enjoyed as
the Sweet Adelines sang and a
mime performed. Other sponsors
were the YMCA, YWCA, Open
Doors for the Handicapped and
the Volunteer Action Center. ,

Smith, Lane first-round NBA draft picks ‘

By Sam Tallarico
Sports Editor

NEW YORK, NY. — When
former Pitt Panther center Charles
Smith woke up Tuesday morning,
he thought he was finally going
to feel secure.

Smith knew he would be taken
in the first round of the National
Basketball Assocation draft and
could finally get on with his
dream of playing professional
basketball.

But when the Philadelphia
76ers made Smith the third-
overall pick shortly after noon, he
felt something wasn't right.

Smith, while talking to the me-

dia, did not seem too enthusias-
tic about the Sixers. He said he
felt nervous because he had a
feeling Philadelphia was going to
trade him.

He was seen earlier talking to

the Los Angeles Clippers’ person-

nel, who two picks earlier made

Kansas Jayhawk Danny Manning J

the No. 1 pick.

"I came down here and
thought it would come down to
one team, but now it's two,”
Smith said. ’’I heard rumors of a
trade, but you just have to take it
as it comes. It's probably a better
situation for me in Philadelphia
because of fan support, and the
Sixers like to run a |ot."

Price wins Family  
House Invitational
in sudden death

By Matt Martin

Sports Editor

Although Monday and Tues-
day's Family House Invitational
Golf Tournament at the Oakmont
Country Club is not a sanctioned
PGA event, a naive passerby
never would have known it if he
had happened upon the 34-pro
field vying for the $100,000 first

prize.

Nor would he have known it
from the three—way sudden death
playoff between Nick Price, Craig
Stadler and Chip Beck. Thethree
finished tied at 140 as the two-
day event came to a close and
were forced to battle it out for the
top prize on the 10th hole.

And Price golfed as if he didn't
know this was a non-PGA tour,
as if he were playing for the U.S.
Open Championship, sinking a
putt of just inches after striking
the pole on his second shot to
win the Invitational outright.

Beck shot a par-4 to finish one
shot back while Stadler went one-

- over with a five.

”Everyone was trying today,”
said Price, who led the field with

Five Big

By Sam Tallarico
Sports Editor

NEW YORK, NY — Although it
may seem the Big East hasn't
been too successful in sending
representatives to the NBA in re-
cent years, this season's group
might leave its mark.

Four Big East players were
taken in the first round in yester-
day's draft, five overall. They
were all taken before the 30th
pick. Pitt's Charles Smith and Jer-
ome Lane were third and 23rd,
respectively, while Syracuse's
Rony Seikaly was the ninth play-
er taken overall. He becomes the
ﬁrst-ever draft pick for the expan-
sion team, the Miami Heat.

winning the 1983 World Series of
Golf. ”But now I think things are
changing. My game is more well-
rounded than it ever has been.”

But things weren't so rosy for
Price as he finished out the
36-hole event. He bogied the
15th, 16th and 17th holes before
shooting an even par—4 on the
18th hole to end the day with an
on—over 72.

Price said he knew, however,
that the playoff win and victory
money were his when he earned
the right to tee off first after draw-
ing numbers out of a hat.

"I was really happy that I drew
number one,” Price said. ”I said
to myself, ’I’m gonna make three
here.’ ” I

He did, of course, and won his
first playoff ever in the process.
”Playoffs  are not really the
nicest thing to be in," Price said,
"because one shot can do you
in.”

Price's putting almost did him
in first, though. He putted 33
times yesterday compared to 27
on Tuesday, and three-putted on
both the seventh and tenth
greens.

‘'1 was suprised he had that
much trouble,” said Beck, who
was in third place with a 1-under-
par 70 on Tuesday.

But Beck was happy with his
own strong finish, mirroring his
Tuesday score. ’’I couldn't have
played it any better,” he said. "I

Seton Hall forward Mark
Bryant was taken 21 st by the Port-
land Trailblazers while the San
Antonio Spurs picked St. John's
forward Shelton Jones (27th, se-
cond pick in the second round).

Seikaly may feel a little more
honored, as he will go down in
history as the Heat's first draft
pick ever.

"I’m excited to go to Miami,”
said the 6—foot-1 1 center. ”In ord-
er for me to reach my full poten-
tial, I need playing time, so
Miami is the ideal situation for
me."

Seikaly thinks the NBA will be
a better place for him than col-

lege. "Playing man-to-man is

When the Seattle Supersonics
picked Michigan point guard
Gary Grant 15th, a blockbuster
deal went down. The Clippers
traded last year's leading re-
bounder, Michael Cage, to Seat-
tle for Grant. Seattle gave up their
1989 first—round draft pick to
Philadelphia. The Sixers sent
Smith and a No.3 draft pick to the
Clippers for Bradley's Hersey
Hawkins, whom Los Angeles had
taken with the sixth pick.

Smith wasn't really surprised at
being the third player taken .in the
lottery, partly because of what he
was able to do after he finished
at Pitt.

”The college game wasn't

suitable for me, and the pro
teams realized that,” said Smith.
”I did things for them [the
coaches at the Olympic trials]
that they didn't think I could do.

”The shooting range is different
in the pros, but I can play defense
and I'll be playing harder. It's
one-on—one, so I'll get to take it
to the hole."

Smith also wants to prove that
he isn't a ”soft player,” like some
have claimed he was at Pitt.

”My job was to score and cre-
ate things. No one I played
against will say I'm a soft player.
I wouldn't mix it up just so I
could stay in the game.

”I am a rebounder and I'll do

whatever the coach wants me to

do, I have no qualms with that.
I was tagged with a label through-
out college of being a soft and
finesse player and it stuck. I just
had to deal with it."

The idea of Smith's being a soft‘,

player would never cross the
mind of Evan Pickman, eastern
scout for the Clippers.

”Our second pick, we were
looking at Charles as opposed to
[Kansas State's] Mitch Richmond
and [Auburn’s] Chris Morris. We
knew Philadelphia wanted
Hawkins, so to get Smith we
went after Hawkins. Philadelphia
got the player it wanted and so

East players taken in NBA draft

great for me. I'll get to use my ath-
letic ability better,” he said.

Seikaly sees an added benefit
of being drafted by"the Heat.
Former Syracuse teammate
Dwayne ”The Pearl" Washing-
ton was left unprotected by the
New Jersey Nets during the ex-
pansion draft.

”I was excited when I played
with him. He's two years older
and two years wiser. I'm looking
forward to it."

Bryant knew he would go in
the first round —— the only ques-

tion was when. ”I didn't know .

who would take me, but I
definitely knew I would go in the
first round.

”Playing at Seton, Hall helped
out quite a bit. Being in the
papers once in a while and being
on CBS helps, too,” added
Bryant.

Fans at the Felt Forum, this
year's draft site, were screaming
for New York Knicks officals to
pick Jones, just as the team
brought in the Redmen's Mark
Jackson last year. Jackson went
on to set the rookie assist mark
and win NBA Rookie of the Year
honors. ‘

For a while, Jones thought he
would be staying in New York.

”I thought I had a good ch'ance
of being with the Knicks because
of trades. I thought I'd go higher

I!

than this, but I'm happy, said

Jones. ’’I’m glad I got picked by
a team. I'll give it 110 percent.

”I don't have any hard feel-
ings,” said Jones, on not being
picked by the hometown team.
”It's a business, not a friendship
game.

NOTES: Speaking of Jackson,
Notre Dame's David Rivers, the
last player taken on the first round
(the 25th pick, by the Los Angeles
Lakers) said he has something to
prove. ’’I’m going to go out and
be another Mark Jackson. I'm go-
ing to go out and show people
what they've missed." '

did we. Seattle even got a good
deal. Everyone winds up getting
who it wanted.”

Former Pitt forward Jerome
Lane, who bypassed his senior
year of eligibility to enter the
draft, was picked 23rd overall by
the Denver'Nuggets. Lane was
not in attendance (he was at his
grandmother's house in Akron)
and neither was graduated -Pitt
small forward Demetreus Gore,
who had a chance to make the
three-round draft, but who was
not chosen and must try to make
a team as a free agent.

When Smith found out about
the trade, he seemed more com-
fortable and for the first time to-
day, relaxed.

''I think now I feel more com-
fortable. The Clippers are the
team for me," said a happier
Smith, last season's Big East Play-
er of the Year and Pitt's all—time
leading scorer.

Smith knows, however, it's go-
ing to take a while for the Clip-
pers to turn the franchise into a
winner.

''It's going to take time, so
we're going to have to be patient.
In Los Angeles, we're going to
work hard. Danny, Gary, Reggie
[Wi||iams, former Georgetown
Hoya star], Norm [Nixon, former
Duquesne Duke], and me, we're
gonna be motivated. I'm ready to
go.”

Smith couldn't seem to say
enough about his new situation.
''I like their style of play. When
you run and get players who play
well — that's what the fans want
to see. I feel good about coming
in with two other No.1 picks.”

lf looked at from Smith's view-
point, it would seem a better pic-
ture than with Philadelphia.

Although the Clippers are go-
ing to the draft for improvement
and are building towards the fu-
ture, Smith won't mind a lean
year or two.

Actually, he sees a lot of

promise with his new team. "The
whole scenario with the Clippers
looks good. The players are
young. I've never played with
Danny, only against him, but
we'll have to be interchangable.

"We have a bunch of winners
on this team. If the winners can
dominate over the losers, we'll be
all right," added Smith.

And if the Clippers do grow
well as a team, Smith may be
well on his way to some sense of
security——mentally and finan-
cially.

Draft Notes: Although Lane was
taken as the 23rd pick on the first
round by Denver, some seemed
to be a little surprised he was still
around that late, including Smith.

'’I feel confident aboutJerome.
Although he's late in the draft,
he'll be fine.

"Jerome was the same as me.
We were both limited. It was
pick, pass, rebound. lt's been that

way through the whole ordeal." _

The_New York Knicks, who
had expressed interest in Lane
last week, acquired last year's
second-leading rebounder
Charles Oakley and Chicago's
first-round pick Monday night for
Bill Cartwright and the Knicks’
first and third-round choices.

"Jerome was on the list, but
(DePaul's Rod) Strickland was the
best player at the position," said
Knicks’ coach Rick Pitino.

Demetreus Gore, on the other
hand, was passed over in this
year's draft. Because of new labor
agreements between players and
the league, the draft lasted only
three rounds. Next year it will
drop to two rounds. Gore may
have been a victim of numbers,
but Smith has other ideas.

"A lot of teams are talking
about Demetreus. He did well at
the Chicago camp, but [NBA
head scout] Marty Blake put in
some negative criticism. Also, be-
cause ofJerome and my situation,
he may be overlooked."

knew that the golf course was
tough." Beck ended up with the
$40,000 second-place prize.

Stadler didn't seem too dis-
traught, either. His third—place fin-
ish was good for $30,000.

Last-place Chris Roderick (167)
was guaranteed $6,000.

''[I played] pretty much up and
down," said Stadler, who shot
par—71 on the day. "I drove pret-
ty well.,l three—putted 16, but I
had a little better finish anyway."

Price's revitalizing win has him
"Keyed up for the British Open."
The South African—born Price said

he realizes what it takes to win a
tournament.

"You have to be in a position
to win on the last nine holes. The
last nine holes are what deter-
mines it," he said, alluding to the
fact that he might have been in
a position to win the 1982 Brit-
ish Open, '85 PGA and '86
Masters if he had followed this
theory.

"You've got to learn to lose be-
fore you can win," Price said.
"It's taken me five years to get to
the stage I'm at now."

But it took him only two days
to win $100,000 and boost his
slumping career.
