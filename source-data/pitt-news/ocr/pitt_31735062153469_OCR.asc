‘ “If I don’t return to the scene of

\ This announcement was made by
'Chairman_Norman MacLeod at a meet-
.ing of ‘the Junior class Monday morn-
ing.- Mr. ‘1\/Ia,cLeod said. in part:
“There is one thing I would like to
clear up in the minds of the student
body, and that is the great expense
.-that most of the students think the
prom will incur.
how it can cost any ‘student more than
from $7 to $8. s The price "of admission
is $4.00, which includes the dinner;
and the other expense is the taxi bill.
There will be no ﬂowers; it is speciﬁ-
cally stated upon every -ticket ‘Omit
ﬂowers from costume.’ Every member
of the class ought to -be present to
make this affair‘ the greatest
history" of Old Uni.” ,
» Many members» of the class pro-
posed that the "week of February 16;
be made _“Juni-or week” at the Uni-.
versity. These suggestions are to be
blroughtcup at the next regular'meet-
ring of the class next Monday morning.
 “Every student of the University

should be on hand to attend the Prom.
on the 16”, said John A. Tho-lnpson,
president of the class.
there are many who think that the
Prom. is one of these stiff aﬂairs. The
only thing stiff about it is the formal
shirt.‘ This function is being held
under the auspices of our class, and
it is the ‘duty of every member in the
class to talk it up among his fellow

that it is a Pitt affairfor every mem-
ber of the University, including fac-
ulty, alumni and the student body.

Thisis a radical depalﬁre from the
‘plan of former years, occasioned by
the elimination of the annual Pitt-
State Concert, which was always held
on the eve of the annual football
game at T_hanks.givin:g. Two -concerts
will be given in,stea.d of one so that
an opportunity of hearing the clubs
will be given to every student.

The tickets for the ﬁrst concert
on March 2 will not be diﬁerentiated
as to-value, as every seat in the house
will be w-orth the same price. 1 Any
student can get two tickets anywhere
in the house. For the second concert
on March 3, the: orchestra, and the
ﬁrst two rows in the balcony will be

reserved for thecAlumni‘and friends
of the University. Thus it is hoped
that every student will receive im-

by the Advisory Board last week.
Regular‘ rehearsals are beingheld

New material is needed in all parts,
as several defe ts were discovered
on the Christmas trip. An. extensive
trip for the Easter vacation is_being
outlined by the management, whlch to-

Theeditor would like to say in
onnejction with the third item
lrnentioned above, that it has been ’
suggested that because he is not
in ' sympathy with aglven. aspect »
of a :moot question,-« it is useless
to address communications .to
him in favon of that side. i We
LL,a.re sorry that it is so difﬁcult to
understand that a man can be a
. partisan and at the same time al-.
low jfair play and free speech upon
any-issue that concerns the con.
stituency whom it is his business
to serve. No reasonably worded
Lcommunication, however opposite

THE WAY o'u'r Student Activities,

be one of determination to stand

the present year which in no way

Two sidelights have come -out of;
the discussion, which aiford interest-

 future action. The

‘originall commission
. . under which the Ad-i
BY-PRODUCTS .vis.ory Board ~_to

LLLL .
«operating, is in the

A of the Board. of Trustees, declaring
that some mleanls is necessary for the
supervision of the -student activities, »
which will not permit their misman-
agement or‘ assumption of impossible l
liabilities. The student activities fee
of $3.50 is then apportioned by dire‘-

division. which has been in force inethe A
pa}st,, i. e., $1.00 ea.chL to the PITT
._WEEKLY., the Musical Clubs and the
Cap -and.Gown club, the /Adrvisory
Board" being empowered solely to ad- “
minister this “three dollars, upon con-
dition of the :p'I"OpeI" ﬁnancial man.-
.agement ‘of the activities“ We are
quite ~certa.in that the student body
in general has not been aware of this
fact, nor were even the student mem-
bers of the Adviso Board until last
week.‘ It is .pLeerl1~a‘ps a little surprising .
that such incomplete legislation should.
Lorlginally have. been LL approved by the a
Board of 'Trustees.. _The question at
the present .time,2l1owever, is: Is there
not some means of more strictly deﬁn-

ible L and inclusive? We know that
the Adwisory Board itself is conscious
_of these deﬁciencies, and will L take.-
what steps are practicable L l toward
their removal. A J . LL .
The other point we have in mind is A
closely connected ‘with; the one above
referred to,__and has’ to do with. the .
need of some body A» with powenover

Dear Sir: A d _ L.
I feel that for theigood of the Cap
and Gown Club, theuletter printed last
week over the name of the graduate
manager and club members was ina.d- 7
visable.
said before, the real issue is to bring
the. student body and the Cap Land’
Gown Club into harm.ony. ,LL L LL L
The graduate manager, probably be-
cause he does not come into contact
with‘ the student body in« general, is
mistaken in saying the dis.satisfe.ction
lies with a few. ma.lcontentLs. The stu-
dent body isnot in sympathy with the
club; or7 we might better say, was not‘
“in, sympathy with itlast year while
the annual ‘play was being produced.
‘Two, or three conditions are~reca.1Ied
whicl: serve-as examples of the causes‘
of this dissatisfaction.» _ A A P 
body, which makes upitls cast and I

was obligeddvto take the poor seats.
The writer speaks of the aboveas hav-’
ing come to his notice; there may be
other incidents of la. similar nature.
It‘-has been said. that “Only those
who want to deceivethe public keep it
in ignorance”. The declared intention
of the manalgement is totreat the ‘stu-
dent bodyfairly. Despite such occur-
rences as above me'ntioned, however,

University is announcedfor the Hotel
Schenley —'Wednesday, February 16,
and ‘a large turn out of the alumnimis
desired. The rate for the grads is’

$5.00 per couple.

As the years go by and the Junior
“Prom” becomes a. more prominent
feature of the social life of Pitt, the
alumni are showing more interest by
their attendance. At the “Prom”
last year the attendance of grads was
larger than ever before and this mark

promises to be exceeded at the 1917

“Prom.” This is essentially a Pitt
aﬁair, for the graduates and under-
graduates only. The Alumni Secre-

A/News dispatches from East Youngs-
town, 0., the seat of the recent labor

r riots at the plant of the Youngstown

Sheet and Tin ,Plat_e Company works,
tell of the thrilling experiences of Dr.

» J. L. Smythe, onelof ‘the -1911 Medical

‘graduates, who practices there. The
Pittsburgh “Dispatch” of January 8th
has the following article:-— .
I A “It is not given to many men to have
the building in which they are succor-
in-g bullet. -wounded charity patients,
blown down about their ears. Yet this
is fwhatiell to the lot of Dr.-J;. L.
Smyth, when V rioting strikers dyna-
mited the‘ postofﬁce here last night?“
Not only did" the doctor escape him-
sel~f,..but he carried with him, his wife
and '26-months-old son. 

“S-myth, who is a native of the
Southside, Pittsburgh, was graduated
from the University of Pittsburgh in
the class of 1911. .His father, John P.
Smyth, is a well known Southsider,
having beenengaged in the hotel busi-
ness near South Twenty-eighth street
for many years.

Dr. Smyth was besieged with calls for
assistance. -.I,-I0 rendered aid to sev-
eral victims while the latter were ly-
ing in the streets and then returned
to his office, where he found awaiting
him one woman andilnine men, all of
whom were suﬁering from bullet
wounds. ‘ ‘p _. » ‘ A A
“The eighth patient was being at-
‘tended when the ﬁrst shot of dyna-
mite was exploded in the postoﬁice
building. This blew out the entire

vﬁces and living apartments ontthe ‘sec-
ond floor, rushed to a rear room where
his wife and baby were. He seized
the two and started for the-back stair-
way. Before he reached this avenue‘
of escape, a second charge of dyna-
mite was exploded, and the backvwall
fell. Immediately the building took
[ﬁre and Smyth, realizing that quick
action was necessary, lowered his wife
as faras he could reach and then let
go. i Mrs. Smyth escaped unhurtf Fol-
lowed the baby, and he too, was un-
injured. 

“By this time the strikers were
pouring bullets into the burning build-
ing. iFearing lest one of the leaden
Lmilliles should ﬁnd lodgment .in him-
self or in the person ofihis dear ones,
Dr. Smlyth leaped to the ground, hus-
tled Mrs. Smyth and Smyth junior into
an auto and escaped to Youngstown.

“The doctor’s only salvage from the
wreck was his ;auto. He has borrow-
ed a medicine case. from a brother
practitioner and today is about his
business as usual.” 6 ' -

 L. Rogaliner, A -’04
A Pneumonia r Victim

 

On returning to the office after an
iabsende of several weeks folrlowing
the Penn State football game, the
Alumni Secretary was greatly shocked
tohear of the death of that sterling
fellow; William L..Rogaliner, a grad-
uate of the‘ class of 1904, Mechanical

Engineering. Mr. Rogaliner died De-

cember 5th at the West Penn Hos-
pital, suﬂering an attack of pnenmonia
as a result of a cold contracted at the
Penn State game. He‘ was‘imm.edi-
atelytaken to ‘the hospital, but the
best 0f medical attention was without
,avail. His death occurred a few days
‘after his removal there. A
1 Mr. Rogaliner was employed as a
draftsman with the Bureau of Engin-
eering of the City of Pittsburgh. He
was unmarried and made his home
with his brother-in-law at -5643 North-
umberland street. At the time of his
death, he was aged 32, years.
The Secretary became very well ac-
quainted with the deceased during the
football season when he often visited
the office and secured tickets. He

was ‘a true blue football fan and at
. true blue Pittman in every way. He

always took delight in saying a goo

word for his Alma Mater. ° —
A year ago lhebecame a member

of the General j Alumni Association

and often told‘ the writer howrhe en- '

joyed reading the “Pitt lWeekly” and
keepingi closgr to the University
through the Alumni affiliation. Of
friends, he has an abundance. His
pleasant disposition and ‘line char-
acter insured him these.

Pitt lost a good loyal son when the
grim reaper called “Roggie” -to the

Great Beyond.

The most welcome news that has
been given out by the athletic authori-
ties for a long time is the announce-
ment that Charles Reineckehas been
reappointed as coach for the wrest-
ling team. The. successful work ac-
complished by. the popular coach last
year was such ’tha.t- the authorities
were extremely anxious to-iget him
to train the matmen again this year.
It was doubtfulofr a time Whether he
would beable topaccept the odor as

it was feared that business affairs

would prevent him from giving any
time to outside work. However news
was received the early part‘ of the
week that hephad‘ arranged it so that
he would’ be able to be with the fel-
lows again this year." i . . t ~

The men entered from the Uni- i

versity in the championship meet at

the P. A. A. did, ’as_well as could be

expected, considering that few of them
had had any practice and they had
worked without any coach. None of
the men took premier honors but ‘a’

number of them‘ lasted to the ﬁnals. ‘
The best match ofthe tourney was the ‘

one between Acting Captain Ray Huff

of the Blue and Gold squad and Harry

Jenkins,‘ former national champion
andat present Middle Atlantic A. A.
U- champion, After having thrown
both Fulkman and Tomlison of the
P. A. A., Huff entered the ﬁnals
against Jenkins. After over ﬁve min-
utes of the prettiest and most spirited
wrestling, seen during thetourney, the
former State man slippedinto avbody
hold -and the Pitt captai-n’s shoulders
were pinned to the mat. _
~ Other Pitt -men who showed up well
were E. G. Francis, Robert] Ferguson,
J .g Forster, Philip McNa1ly, Ian Forbes,

Dear Sir: _

Why did John Fry-or, the best bass
drummer-that Pitt ever had, not play
inthe student band‘ last fall?

' . Beatrice X-—~Ed. ’17.

Answer:  Fryor would have
again occupied the position in which
he won such undying fame, but upon
investigation it was found thatihe had
already won his letter in this sport
for four consecutive years.- This, of
course,made him ineligible for furth-

Stanley F. Hodgson, a‘ Fellow in
Pure Chemistry in the ‘Department of
Research in Pure Chemistry of. the
Mellon Institute of’ Industrial Re-
search, died in St. Francis Hospital,
Pittsburgh, January 7, from pneumo-
nia, after a brief illnessfof one week.

Stanley Feather Hodgson was born
at Brantford. Ontario. on February 4,
18.92, and was/the son of Alfred and
Alice Feather Hodgson, now of 0:319.
donia, Ontario. Following his gradu-
ation from the Brantford Collegiate

of Toronto for two-years and then ma-
triculated at the University of Pitts-
burgh, where he was graduated in

Science. in Chemical‘ Engineering.
He planned ‘to pursue graduate work
and then enter the industrial ﬁeld,-
‘and, with this object in view, -he was
successful in being appointed a Fellow
in Pure Chemistry in tl1e’De'partme11t
of Research in Pure Chemistry of the
Mellon Institute, where, during the
past’ three months, he pursued ad-
vanced work in _ physical chemistry
under.IProfessor Rosanoff, in candi-

ence.   . A A
As a student, Stanley Hodgson was
a faithful and earnest worker, and one

integritYgin»mind and inheart, of pure
purpose and clean life, who spoke no
evil and who was generous in judg-
ment. While extremely modest, he
-possessed, real strength; and’ courage.

Stanley Hodgson was well; spent and
wellvﬁlled by its ideals and devotion.
-He was a member‘ of the American

' Chemical’ Societyﬂ and, during -his

undergraduate days, was active in the
affairs of the University of Pittsburgh

Chemical Society. He was la charter
member of Omega Chapter of Alpha

Chisigma, and was one of the i.m.o“_st
enthusiastic’ workers in. the Chapter.
In his death the fraternity has-lost

took constant pride in promotingits
interests.’ ' -

Now that the temporary scaffolding
of life has fallen away, the‘ true no-
bility of iHodgson’ls character stands
clearly revealed ‘in all its beauty, a
worthy inspiration ;to all students.
His ‘genial nature, broad sympathies,

ed by his. many. friends. /
