Hop Escorts

Leap year comes but once every
four years, but Heart Hop comes
once a year. and they’re both
heading this way again Friday,
Feb. 20 in the Schenley Hotel ball
room.

Girls will have their annual
chance to do the courtin’ and this
year’s Heart Hop adds the “new

table and parsley cox-sages.

Heart Hop is a tradition begun
in 1942 when a date bureau was
set up a few days before the dance
to register “blind dates.” Girls

Davis Leaves:
Council Plans
48 Program

Chuck Davis left the Men’s
Council witness stand Thursday to
deliver his farewell address dur-
ing a session which included broad
plans for the coming year.

Davis’ curtain—dropper
mild compared to those heard. dur-
ing recent weeks, embodying only
a challenge to the Council to go
on and do better things for the
students of the University.

Heading the Council program
was the decision to install the
planned men's lounge in the for-
mer band rehearsal room on the
eighth floor.

A $700 appropriation for fur-
nishings was made with the un-
derstanding that the band would
still use the room when necessary,
but would otherwise leave it avail-
able to all men enrolled in the
University.

The semi-annual discussion of
the freshman orientation program
revealed that spring classes on the
school tradition and" history will
be held during every hour ‘on
Thursdays and Fridays.

The schedule will end. in a
smoker planned along the lines of
pre-war aﬁairs at which fresh-
men could meet various student
representatives stationed in booths
for convenience in answering in-
dividual questions of the new men.

The opening date for Men’s
Council's used bookstore was set
for Feb. 3, continuing on through
February 20.

Faculty Reviews
Speaker Issue

Members of the faculty had their chance to

tell the committee of deans what they thought
about bringing political speakers to Pitt.

Until the recent review of the University’s poli-
cy the attitude has been to have no political speak-
ers, as such, speak with sponsorship of the school.
When a local political group offered the services
00f Henry Wallace as a lecturer

the University declined, _precipi-
tating much comment from the
student body. -

Student Congress has asked for

a review of the policy and the
faculty meeting was the second
in that review. Student opinion
was heard two weeks ago in the
first meeting.
M No,action was taken at either
meeting but the opinions present-
ed will be considered if the of-
ficials make another statement
of policy. Dr. Stanton C. Craw-
ford was chairman of the group
as it heard some arguments for
all sides of. the case.

Urgingthat any and all speak-
ers should be permitted to speak,
Dr. M. R. Gabbert, head of the
philosophy department feels that
it is a University duty to “. . .
live dangerously and not be like
Ceasar’s wife.”

He further qualified his remarks
that these speakers
should be brought to the campus
by student groups and not the
University itself. The public, as
informed by the press might. con-
sider-this to be actual sponsor-

shop by the University, accord- 

ing to Dr. Warren Nystrom, head
of the geography department.
“We have to consider public re-

action,” he said, but stressed that

we should strive for a liberal po-
sition. This attitude was mention-
ed by others of the faculty in fav-
or of bringing controversial is-
sues out into the open.

“This policy as it now stands
is designed to keep away ext:-em-
ist left-wingers,” said Dr. J, P.
Watson. He also reminded that po-
litical speakers would come to a
city the size of Pittsburgh under
the auspices of political groups

anyhow, thus offering students and

opportunity to hear them.

Act 011 Speakers
The report of the second of a series of in-
quiry meetings into the question of Political
speakers on this campus is in today’s issue.
It.is a report we are more than happy to
print; -

This _is the second time during the course
of this term when the University Administra-
tion has acted with thoroughness on recom-
mendations from Student Congress. The fact
that there are no students in the deciding group
concerning political speakers might bring reas-
onable criticism.

However, the steps made by the present
Adiniiiistration to straighten out Pitt prob-
lems is an omen of better things to come.

Commendations

Pitt gets plastered-——and is proud of it.

The aforementioned plastering in this case
refers to the work being done on the third
an deighth floors. They’re hard at it up there
and the results are very pleasing to the eye.
Actually, they’ve been hard at it for some

months and the improvements, though gradu- I

al, are now considerable.

The administration and Chancellor Fitz-
gerald are to be commended for the manner
in which the work has been carried out-—
with a minimum of inconvenience to both
students and faculty. While the students
enjoy a two week mid-year vacation, the pneu-

, ma ic hammerers will continue to hammer, the

   
 

Wreckers will continue -to Wreck, the plasterers
will continue to plaster, and the painters will
continue to paint, (strong union, you know).
When the students return, the third and eighth
ﬂoors should be pretty well plastered. And if
the boom holds up long enough, we can all
look forward, in the not’ too distant future we
hope, to Pitt’s being completely plastered.

VVhile the plastering firoceeds, incidentally,
the News, Owl, and Panther oiiices are tempor-
arily located in the Bigelow avenue wing of
the Cathedral instead of their normal Fifth
avenue wing location.

  And Morel I Praise

Plaudits to Director Robert L. Author and
the 120-piece University Marching Band for
their great performance in the “1947 Stadium
Review” last Thursday evening.

-The musical aggregation played “indoor
music” in a striking fashion that——to put it
mildly-—brought . enthusiastic response from
the audience.

. It was disheartening to note that the Sold
iers and Sailors auditorium had quite ‘a few
empty seats. Only 788 music listeners were
present with the studentisale of tickets far
down in the minority. Perhaps, the advent of
exams was responsible for this lack of support.

We Quit

There comes a. time in the lives of all stu-
dents when they must I-«féturn to the ignomini-
ous purpose for which they are here. In-short,
the time has come for ﬁnal exams. -

—The Pitt News would like to wish every
reader luck on the coming ordeal and an en.-
joyable vacation. With this hope for the hope-
less, we announce that The News will go on
an extended three Week vacation‘, following
this edition. '

Our next journalistic endeavor will reach
campus Friday, February 6, registration week.
For those who have messages to give, deadline
date is Wednesday, Feb. 4, at 3 p. In.

And now for the books.

'Worfburg Trumpet’

Back 9
 pan of Education

The Wartbug Trumpet, way out in Waverly,

weeks ago. In an editorial backing the lighter side.
of campus life, the astute edit writer proclaimedzi
“If the average college man were asked to make
a list of the most important factors in the ‘gain-
ing of his college education, he would most likely
forget to mention ‘bull sessions’.”

The prodigious typist from Iowa has much
to back hisutheory. But, I doubt that he has
spent an afternoon in Pi_tt’s Tuck Shops. It’s
probable that the average Pitt man would
delete, with emphasis, any mention of this man-
ner of gaining an education.

Can you imagine listing a complete knowledge
of how to get drunk on three drinks, what the
well dressed sorority will ‘wear to a taffy-pull, or
how nice it would be if all professors dismissed
class ten minutes early?

Then, you could tell a prospective employee
that you were well versed‘ in matters of the

., heart, with complete tabulations of the num-
ber of pinnings and engagements and the

number ofreturned pins and engagement rings
during the average college year.

No, I think the Wartburg trumpeter would be

way off track with the merits of a bull session,

here. _It is a rare happening when two or three
Pittiteg get together to talk about the present‘
trends of national or international politics, of the
way that othe philosophy of an entire nation is

In Waverly, it might be diﬁerent. But it’s a
sure bet that today’s bull sessions at Pitt won’t
be listed as positive education.

Pitt ’s mystery Romeo of the year is James Hamilton. Not
the James Hamilton who attends Pitt but the James Hamilton
who attends Pitt, yet does not attend Pitt. W

This grade A muddle was kicked up by the American
Weeklyr, the registrar’s ofﬁce, and a student who may not even

exist.

The.Weekly, a national magazine, claims to have received

a letter from “James Hamilton, a
19-year-old student at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh,” who pro-
tests the fact that young students
——especially‘ non-GI’s—are unable
to get married because of the cost
of education.

Mr. Hamilton, according to the
Weekly, points out that profes-
sional men nowadays must wait
until they’re 30 or ‘over to start
their ‘families.

Can nothing be done about the
situation?

oldex-sailor who states that he
most deﬁnitely did not write the

Mr. Hamilton—that is, the one
who has been located—-wants it
known that he has no marital
problems, and what is more he is
having trouble enough “getting by

Right now, Hamilton says he is

layed to the Tuck Shop by Betty
McGuire.

While swimming around in a
big bowl of coke, a big murderous
paw, jabbed into her bowl and
caught her by the tail. She strug-
gled, ﬂopped to the ﬂoor gasping
for water.

Betty tried artiﬁcial respiration;
she even dumped Gretel back in-
to the bowl of water, but the kill-
er would not be denied.

2 A crowd gathered, but undaunt-
ed, the paw jabbed again.

Gretel died of fright.

Pete Watson thought a moment,

dumped her into a coffee cup, and

then in front of some thirty or
more witnesses, it happened.

Pete swallowed the helpless
goldﬁsh.

Pete had only one comment:

“Burp——another ten years shot to
hell!”

Burrey Gives Opinion

Of French University-Wonderful

Students are pretty much the same the world over, ac-
cording to Susanne Burrey, former English instructor at Pitt
who left for Grenoble, France, several months ago to do gradu-

ate work.

In a letter to Mrs. Ruth C. Mitchell, who is in charge of
the nationality rooms here, Miss Burrey wrote, “I would ad-
vise anyone who wants to go to Europe by no means to
hesitate. It’s worth it; it’s won-* ‘

derful.”

said Miss Burrey. “We are quite
a melange in the lecture halls as
you can imagine—a few are even
middle-aged but most of the stu-
dents are like those ‘everywhere

—if a little more serious! I’m not
sure.”

Miss Burrey feels that the op-
portunity for cultural interchange
is one of the greatest advantages
of foreign study. Most of the stu-
dents speak English.

The congenial atmosphere is
not restricted to the school. Im-
agine shaking hands with your
neighbor every time you see him.
That’s what the residents of the
pension, or hotel, where Miss
Burrey resides do.

It’s quite different from the
American apartment building
where one never knows the peo-
ple next door, she points out.

Some Rooms Heated

That isn’t the only difference,
says Miss. Burrey. Most of the
classes are held in the Palais de
l’Universite, “in which some of
the rooms have heat.”

Teas aren’t like the ones held
in the Pitt Commons Room eith-
er. At a tea Miss Burrey attend-
ed she brought the sugar, at Turk-
ish couple brought Turkish cig-

arettes, a Frenchman, Grand
Chartreuse, and an American
couple, tea.

“We cached some bread from
the dining room, and someone
added some cheese bought in
Switzerland,” she said.

Sally-Joy Oleon   Chosen Member
Of “Mademoise||e" College Board

For the ﬁrst time in severalﬂ
years, Mademoiselle magazine has
honored a Pitt mademoiselle.

Sally-Joy Oleon, one of Pitt’s
leading pre—legal students, has
been chosen as a member of the

She was selected on the basis
of an essay she submitted on In-
ter-Collegiate Government, show-
ing just what the role of a college
forum is in the world of today.

She says, “I didn’t think any-
thing would come of it, so I
didn’t tell anyone I entered.” One
day last fall, however, she came
home from a football game and
found a small pink enevelope with
Mademoiselle’s address on the
back ﬂap—-—and now she’s telling
everyone about her good fortune.

For Three Games  i

 

Pitt’s baskethall team goes East this weekend with hopes for as
much success as it enjoyed in their previous eastern trip to West
Point. Dodo Canterna, who scored 15 points at the Academy, cares
not for Horace Greely’s advice.

they would rather pay than play,
so they failed to appear for their
scheduled contests.

As a result Leo Bemis, director
of intramural sports, rung up $15
on his register. With ﬁve men on
a team that is a 50 cents per cap-
ita rate.

The YMCA bowlers, who were
present along with the Electrons,
were probably the causelof the
wholesale /forfeitures. It was the
last day of the season and the Y
had such a tight grip on first place
that the other teams didn’t see
much point in being there.

Scheduled to meet the Vets No.
1, the’ Y cinched the league title
without toppling a sirfgle pin.
Had the Vets No. 2 appeared and
Won two out of three games and
had the Y lost two _.out of three,
there would have been a first
place tie.

The Manifolds, by forfeiting to
the Electrons, gave the latter
three victories and the deed to
second place.

ground for its undefeated array
Friday and Saturday, then re-
turned home _and added individual
laurels as unattached competitors
in Sunday’s local AAU champion-
ships.

Ben Grady’s tankers swallow-
ed potent Fenn, 44-.31, Friday
night at the Foxes’ Fisher pool.

Bob Brugger cracked a district
record in the AAU swimming
championships Sunday afternoon,
negotiating the 60-yard free. style
grind. in 31.2 seconds to win the
event’s junior championship. He
placed fourth, however, in the
senior swim won in slower time.

Bob McHale topped the 100-
yard junior breaststroke toga, and
Mike Levine took the 100yard
junior free style. Levine, Dick
Petro and Bill Grant placed in
other events.

The Panthers meet Colgate at Hamilton, New York, on Friday
night and Cornell at Ithica on Saturday.

The Pitt—Co1gate gameis something of a rubber match inasmuch
as the two schools——which incidentally have not clashed
l928—ho1d three victories" over each other.

‘ It is possible the Raiders may

since

operate with two units, one tall
and the other small but faster.
Ernie ‘Vandeweghe, six foot three
inch center, is the pride and joy
of Coach Karl Lawrence.

Last season Vandeweghe estab-
lished an all-time Colgate indiv-
idual scoring record with 329
points in 17 games The only com-
mon foe of Pitt and Colgate is
Penn State who defeated the
Raiders but lost to Pitt.

Dr. Carlson’s gang ‘should ﬁnd
the going rougher against Cornell
than against Colgate. The Big
Red is currently up to its neck
in the race for the Ivy League ti-
tle. - -
N.Y.U., the sensation of Mad-
ison, Square Garden, tumbled
Cornell, but by only ﬁve points,
58-53. Bob Gale, captain and
scoring threat of Cornell, rack-
ed up 20 markers against the Vio-
lets.

On Jan. 31 the Panthers grap-
ple with Penn State at ‘State Col-
lege. In their previous game at
the Stadium Pitt copped a 35-
34 decision. But with their re-
cent upset over West Virginia,

the Lions have the Panthers wor-

ried.

Buckeyes Rout Pin. 74-55:  
Canferna Registers 21 Points

Although Dodo Canterna chipped in 21 points, which «set a new
season mark for Panther scorers, Ohio State's Dick Schnittlier came
a through with a 22-point effort as the Buckeyes powdered Pitt, 74-
56, at the Columbus Coliseum Saturday night.

Trailing 31-19 at the intermission, Pitt pulled up to 31-24 in the
early minutes of the second half before the fast-breaking Buckeyes
regained control. The triumph snapped a‘ three-game" State losing
streak and cut the Panther victory string at five straight.

Tippy Dye’s tall sophomores recorded 26 ﬁeld goals to 19 for the

Pitts and topped the Panthers at
the foul line with 20 free throws.

Hoopsters

At Mid-Season Mark

By Bob Van Atta

Bridgevjlle Samniy David needs less than a ﬁve point aver-
age for each of the next nine games to better the total with
which he led the varsity basketball scorers last season.

The dark-haired gilurd has tallied 130 points in 12 games
compared to the 171 total he recorded during the ’46~’47 cam~

paign. His 10.8 per game average.

is tops for the Panthers.

Guard Bil1'Cieply and scrappy
Bimbo Cecconi are virtually sure
bets to beat their third and ﬁfth
place totals of last year. Co—Cap—
tain Cieply registered an even
100 in the ’46-’47 race, while Cec-
coni rung up 55 markers. «

.Runner-up Dodo Canterna is
hot after his last year’s total of

151 points. He has 116 tallies with
the schedule just past the halfway
point. 

Canterna’s 21 point effort at
Ohio State Saturday was the best
individual effort of the season.
The Panthers have won ﬁve and
lost seven. Three of their victor-
ies were scored at the Stadium
where they are undefeated.

Icardi Addresses Men's Club
On ‘Fair Weather’ School Spirit

“School Spirit” was the topic ofg
principle speaker “Ike" Icardi at
an informal meeting of the YMCA
Men’s Club this week.

After opening the smoker with
group singing, the meeting seated
itself to hear introductory remarks
by Chairman Chuck Jennings, who

Main substance of Icardi’s ad-
dress was that although the out-
ward manifestations of “school
spirit" was the support of athletic
teams on the ﬁeld, the “real and
important spirit” came from an in-
ward. sense of pride in the Uni-
versity.

“Pitt." he said, “is people, and
more than that it is an established,
successful institution.” He ad-
monished the fair-weather fans of
Pitt who take from the school
everything that is good but harp
on the poor features. “Like a
lawyer who is presenting his case
to a jury,” he said, they exploit
Pitt’s good points when speaking -
of Pitt to people and save the bad
for constructive analysis.”
