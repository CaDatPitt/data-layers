many, and other European coun-
tries. H
Purpose Cited

The purpose of the ‘S” Award,
established‘ two years ago, is to
Sail, See, Study, and Speak in"for'-.
eign lands. In McCabe’s “State-
ment of Purpose for the scholar-'
ship, he wrote the following state-

ing the world smaller each year,

Omnibus Sales

Hit Top at 300

“Omnibus,” Pitt’s monthly

literary-humor magazine, has
announced a sellout of some
800’; copies of its February edi-
tion.‘ The magazine, which
has only been published ﬁve
times, went on sale Tuesday, Feb.
7, during'registration week and
was sold out by.Thursday, Feb.
9. .
’,Two hundred more copiesof
this issue have been ordered and
will be available in the Omnibus
office, 830 C1.

Artie Steinberg, Col. ’57, busi-.
ness manager, announced that
“Omnibus” has risen to a peak of
$400 income through ads from ’a
September low of $80. . _ « '

Steinberg has credited the sell-

out to the use of “subtle college
humor.” He said Pitt is, “now on
the waypto, having 'a magazine
that ,will appeal to“ all types of
University students.” . ' ‘
-‘ A new format, different in both
literary and mechanical style, ‘was
used by‘ the staff, -and a new
character, Fitzhugh Schenley, was
introduced. > - = "

The column written by Fitz-
hugh is a humor;column about

‘ events around the University. This

type of light reading plus‘ other
timely information has helped the
magazine reach its plateau of

“high college humor.”

before Student Congress, at its
meeting Monday, by Miss Emily

before every meeting,” ‘Miss Ir-

SC follow this example,‘ ‘at least
to the extent that reports are
typed in full and read in an aud-
ible voice at meetings.” ,

One of the standing commit-
tees of the Senate handles stu-
dent-faculty. relations. Miss Ir-
vine, once a member of this
committee, commented that dur-
ing her term the committee was
very active and worked closely
with student groups on many
projects.

The duty of this committee is
“to establish a closer relationship
between student and .faculty.”
Student Congress. presently has a
standing cominittee whose duties,
as outlined by the SC constitu-
tion, -are identical. That committee

indicated the preference of some

Chest Drive Sets Record of $25400

Paced by classroom donations of $773.05, the 1955 Pitt¢
Chest Drive set a new record,

soaring to $2,540, and achiev-

ing approximately 30% participation. ~

The Engineering and Mines Cabinet started the ball roll-
ing with a $100 donation and the Dental School students
gave the drive a tremendous boost with a $350 gift, fulﬁlling
their goal of 100% participation.

Alpha Phi Omega’s “Ugly Man
contest” added $190, junior and
senior Pharmacy students contrib-
uted $35, and the Evening School
Association, along with $500 in ad-
ditional donations, pushed the
total sky—ward.

“Although Pitt had a very
successful drive,” states Clar-
ence Kylander, Col. ’56, Chest
Committee Chairman, “Carnegie

He and his associates are also

trying to investigate various com-

can learn, as well as the limits of
these capacities.

Rhesus monkeys were chosen

After investigation, the experi-

vanced monkey had been lifting
up a screen while they were set-
ting up the problem, in order to
ﬁnd out which object was the cor-

The monkey stopped learning

Dr. Julius A. Koch, ﬁrst dean of the University’s School“ I

of Pharmacy, died Friday, Feb. 10, in Ocala, Fla. at the

age of 91.

Dr. Koch graduated in 1884 from what was then the
Pittsburgh College of Pharmacy, seven years later accepted
the deanship. After serving seventeen years as dean, he
was appointed professor of chemistry and Director of the

Chemical Laboratories of
School of Medicine.
'VVell-known for his work in
organic chemistry, ,Dr. Koch,
along with a German co-worker,
devised a method for synthesiz-
ing aromatic aldehydes. To most
workers in that ﬁeld, this be-
came popularly known as the
Gatterman-Koch synthesis.
Dr. Koch was born in Germany
in 1864. Even as a young man he

Lazor Duels With Riley
C 0 a c h Grove Washabaugh’s

A hoopsters have been very generous

to the Jungle Cats this season, and
without their generosity, things

pcould be just a little darker, rec-

ord-wise, for the Timmorismen
than the present two game range
above the .500 mark.

Although tournament bids
areh’t resting on the outcome,
the Panther-Titan tussle should
provide an interesting scoring
duel between Bob Lazor and Jim

— Riley.

Both of these hot shots have
been averaging close to 20 points
a game and have been carrying the
brunt of their team’s scoring
punch. ' '

Two Seniors Bow Out

Lazor (6-6) meshed 20 points in
his latest effort against Army
while Riley (6-5) tickled the cords
against Youngstown for 34 tallies.

~ Timmons will start his regular

ﬁve of John Riser, Julius Pegues,
Chuck Hursh, Joe Fenwick, and
Lazor. -

Two seniors will make their
ﬁnal appearance before the home
crowd in the likes of Fenwick and
Frank Zimmovan. At the begin-
ning of the season the 6-3 Zim-
movan, who hails from North Un-
ion, couldn’t even make the trav-
eling squad although he was a reg-
ular the last two seasons.

Zimmovan Sixth Man

Zimmovan’s play in the last sev-
eral games, however, has improved
to the point where he is now con-
sidered the number six man on
the team.

At the forwards for the
Titans will be George Strehler
(6-4) and Dave Rankin (6-3)
who excell in the rebounding
department and usually hit for
double ﬁgures in the scoring
column.

are Ron Tranter (5-11) and Har-
old Davis (6-1). Davis is a top

greatly by the Titans. Davis’ one

pounder from West Virginia.

Ed Peery will put his 26-0
record on the line when he
tackles David Gorley in the 130-
pound class, Peery, who won in
the EIWA and NCAA last
year, has injured both his
shoulders so far this season but
is expected to be in good shape
for his match with Gorley.

In the 137—pound class Vic De-
Felice (6-1), an up-and-coming
sophomore, will draw Al Odell of
West Virginia as an opponent.

Bob Bubb, the Panthers’ most

' promising 147-pounder, will be
looking for his sixth win against
one loss when he tangles with
Bill. Mills of the Mountaineers.»

year, will be seeking revenge as¢

Athletic Association pool, Saturday night at 8 p.m. They
will be going for their tenth win of the season as against
three losses, before taking on strong navy at Annapolis,
Feb. 25.
While the navy-men learn to take deep water by the
~ time they graduate, they face aé ’
group of swimmers that have to '
learn to swim in shallow water.
Because the Panthers .practice
daily at the PAA where the pool
,‘i1e,/‘is ﬁlled to capacity only during
meets, they work out in a depth of
three feet.
_ The swimmers close the- current
season at the PAA the following
week against a West Virginia Uni-

fend their ECSA championship at\
