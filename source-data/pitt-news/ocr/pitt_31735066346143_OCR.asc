vol. 65. no. 85

The Student Association Com-
missioners, by a three to one
vote, agreed Sunday night to re-
quest a $4 boost in the Activities
Fee for the Fall Term.

That request, which would hike
the fee to $12 per student per
term, must be approved by Vice
Chancellor for Student Affairs
Bernard Kobosky and the Univer-
sity Board of Trustees before it
becomes policy.

It is expected that the new fee.
if approved. will raise $270,000 in
funds to bedistributed among stu-
dent organizations, compared to
the $190,000 brought in by this
year‘s $8 fee.

The fee boost was recommend-
ed to the Commissioners by the
Student Association (SA) Alloca-
tions Committee.

In their presentation, commit-
tee members argued that the Ac-
tivities Fee hike was necessitated
by the $390,000 requested by all
organizations for the coming
year. Though they trimmed many
budgets, they said, they will be
unable to meet even those pruned

requests without an Activities Fee
hike.

The Commissioners approved
the recommendation by the re-
quired three to one margin. Social
Commissioner Lenny Klavonic.
Programs Commissioner Dennis
Concilla and Academic Commis-
sioner Wade Lawson. critical of
the entire allocations process (see
box following), dissented.

The last step in that process be-
gan Saturday morning when the
Allocations Committee, which had
previously reviewed the budget re-
quests of all campus student -or-
ganizations, presented their sug-
gested allocations to the SA Social
Commission and the Commission-
ers.

According to the newly-formu-
lated allocations procedure. sug-
gested allocations of the commit-
tee must either be adoptedby a
majority of the Social Commis-
sion and the Commissioners or re-
turned to the committee with sug-
gested revisions.

A major decision agreed to by
the group was that no student Ac-

Committees Commissioner
Wade Lawson has likened
members of the SA Social Com-
mission to “.‘ . a bunch of
adolescents trying to play a
major league'basebal| game
in a minor league ballpark.”

Lawson expressed dissatis-
faction with the Commission's
actions during current alloca-
tions meetings, charging Com-
mission members with refus-
ing to “. . . accept responsibli-
ity or to get involved in contro-
versial issues."

Lawson was particularly up-

tivities Fee funds would be used
to pay salaries.

This means that when the SA

budgets come before the group

this weekend, salary proposals
for the SA officials will probably
be rejected. Though claiming that
it would pay its $13,000 wage
schedule from self-generated
monies, Pitt News salary propos-
als were pared from the paper’s
budget Sunday.

Szabo Inauguration Set;

Varied Menu Slated

by RON Lozowsxi

Szabo Food Service will take
over from Saga Food Service on
the night of Friday, July 9. Serv-
ices will begin the following morn-
ing, with full operations under-
way by Monday.

Pitt will become the largest
campus service by Szabo, which
also serves hospitals, office build-
ings, and plants, including a 50,-
000 customer per day operation
for United Aircraft.

Negotiations for the purchase
of Saga’s vening machines have
already been completed, although
a regional director must still en-
dorse them. According to Dennis
Robertson, Szabo’s vice-presi-
dent of marketing, there was no
difficulty in_ arriving at a figure.
Workable machines will remain in
service; unusuable machines will
be replaced during the summer.

Robertson stated that the snack
bars are “all-important" and will

Draft Foes

Frustrated

by MIKE MILLER

Draft opponents were dealt a double blow as two proposals for
terminating military conscription were shot down in the Senate last

week.

An amendment to the pending draft bill, sponsored by Sen. Mark
Hatfield (D.-Oreg. ), which would have ended the -draft on June 30.was

dispatched by a vote of 67-23.

A compromise amendment proposed by Sen. Richard Schweiker
(R.-Pa.) was also defeated bya much closer vote of 49-43.

The Schweiker amendment proposed a one-year extension of the

draft. 3

A spokesman for Schweiker stated that the Senator favored ending
the draft immediately but realized that such a proposal would never
pass. He offered the one-year extension as a compromise.

The two votes virtually assured that the draft will continue until
June 30. 1973. as the House has already approved a two year extension.

A date for final Senate action on the bill is uncertain.

Draft officials state that they can conscript millions of men who
now hold deferments if the bill fails to pass by June 30. 1971. the

expiration date of the current draft.

Sen. John C. Stennis (D.—Miss.> stated that failure to act on the
bill by June 30 would be a "national calamity.“

Sen. Schweiker was quoted by the New York Daily News as stating
that last minute pressure by the Nixon Administration was based on
assurances that another extension would not be sought after 1973.

According to Sen. Hugh Scott (R.-Pa.) the administration wants
time to gradually phase out the current-selective service system.

, a “Hawaiian Luau”

be the “focal point" of Szabo’s
early effort.

Robertson said that Szabo feels
the Tuck Shop and Hunt Room
warrant “substantial improve-
ment." Expansion of services in
these areas will include the in-
stallation of “Henny Penny“ fried
chicken centers, in hopes of offer-
ing students the same variety of

.choices available at fast-food res-

taurants on campus.

Szabo will also take over opera-
tion of the Medical Center Nurses
Residence (MCRN) cafeteria.
Since in the past this cafeteria
was run by the University, the
change will necessitate an in-
crease in prices. Current prices
at other campus food facilities
will remain unchanged.

In its outline of proposed serv-
ices for the University. Szabo
suggested the_hiring of waitresses
for the faculty dining area. Rob-
ertson maintained that such a
move would enhance the attrac-
tiveness of this facility and could
prove an important "plus" in at-
tracting potential faculty mem-
bers.

To help break the monotony of
the regular schedule. Szabo also
proposes to introduce the “spirit-
lifter" menu—an occasional of-
fering of something different and
unexpected. combined with the
proper atmosphere and em-
ployees in appropriate costume.

Such occasions may range from
to a “Ro-
man Holiday." While Robertson
admitted that such attempts c.;..‘.d
be termed “cornball,” the moves
would be carried out for the im-
provement of student morale.

Robertson voiced the hope that
the quality of the service would
be such that students would leave

set with the $5,845 granted
the Heinz Chapel Choir and
the decision to slice the Pitt
News salary proposal.

Of the Choir, Lawson said .
that it should be funded sub-
stantially by the University,
due to its public relations val-
ue.

He also said he still favors
salaries for certain organiza-
tions, in that they function as
“a drawing card that enables
the student who comes from a
family of the under $5,000 in-
come range to participate."

The position against salaries
represents a reversal by the Com-
missioners. Earlier this term,
the Commissioners proposed sal-
aries for themselves and other
SA officials.

Programs Commissioner Con-
cilla said that salary request
could have been honored only if
the Allocations Committee and
the Commissioners had recom-
mended a larger Activities Fee
raise.

“I’m still in favor of salaries,”
he said, “but it's to the point
where we can’t afford them.”,
Concilla also said that a student
had threatened to sue the Uni-
versity is salaries were paid.

To date, roughly 50 per cent of

on the future of arts at the Uni-

Jerome L. Rosenberg, Dean of

reported that “there were barely
enough faculty members for a
quorum" at the session. Conse-

quently, most of the business,

fall.

Commenting on the recently
implemented 40-60 rule that al-
lows a student to earn up to 60
credits in his major but prevents

»more than 40 required major

credit.s “this should ease some
problems for students with ma-
jors in Studio Arts, Theatre and
Music.

“Previously it had been diffi-
cult for a student to get a certain
amount of professional training
during his undergraduate studies.
Now by rearranging the curricu-
him a major can get up to 42 in
Studio Arts.”

A professor of sculpture will be
added to the faculty of the Studio
Arts department, it will be impos-
sible for them to expand their fac-
ulty further. “

When William Saroyan's The Time of Your Life
rushes out at you at full speed. it is electrifying
-and entrancing. When it declines and becomes most
somber it induces fascination and reflections.

The play contains a stream of lively and pungent
dialogue filled with humor and touched with the
dynamic, creative spirit that is the self-indulgent
reflection of Saroyan's humanistic idealism . . an
idealism that is an affirmation of love. optimism
and strength in the obvious midst of evil and uncer-
tainty.

The Time of Your Life is a panorama of impro-
visation. Saroyan. at his best. was a story teller.
Set'in the world of the late 30‘s. his first full
length drama draws together an assortment of
characters.

They are tied together by their common ail-
ments: their troubles . . . their shames.

‘They do managewto pick each other up and in tin-
ality sing a song to life. They do not damn evil . . .
but recognize it as it exists. They do. however. avoid
it by avoiding it in their own actions.

San Fran Saloon

They share their time in a San Francisco honky—
tonk which is Nick's waterfront saloon. It is in this
colorful setting that we meet such characters as a
student of life. the kindly saloon keeper. the street
walker with dreams, an aspiring tap dancer. a fab-
ulous teller of tall tales. a worried cop. a boy in
love and a crazy Arab who lounges in a corner.

Saroyan weaves into each a little hope which
comes about from their existence as they interact
with each other in Nick's entertainment palace.

‘Time  Your Life’

. Electriiies, Entrances

Such hope is neither trite nor undefinable. for as
the play reveals itself—there is an optimism that
grows out of the misery of the world 1 . . that says.
"Live.“ -

Through it all is a lyrical eloquence. There is a
beauty that is as captivating as it is refreshing.
Saroyan’s unmistakable enthusiasm and affection
for people and life is remarkably passionate, mark-
edly genuine, warm and comic.

In the somber and humorous interaction that
takes place on Fosters stage. their is some sort
of love story. It is celebrated as a dance in praise
of life. It seems to say . . . keep pushing those feet
and singing your songs and above all don't forget
to look up.

In the prologue to the play. Saroyan opens with
the statement. "In the time of your life. live-—so
that in that good time there shall be no ugliness or
death for yourself or for any life your life touches."

Canfield’s Direction

Aside from the play itself. which is the reflec-
tion ot the University Theatres concern for perti-
nent and entertaining drama for its audiences. is the
direction which brings Saroyan's vivid writings to
the stage. a

The responsibility for the treatment of The Time
of Your Life is its director. F. Curtis Canfield. Dr.
Canfield has succeeded with marked sensitivity in
bringing out Saroyan at his finest. He has made

some minor deletions in the original script and has

combined some of the dialogue in the latter scenes
to the fullest advantage.

He seems to have taken hold of every subtle
moment . . . of every fiery explosion. giving this
drama the masterful touch of beautiful staging. pre-
cise timing. and realistic action. After seeing this

I will never forget the first
time I heard Helen Reddy’s ver-
sion of “I Don't Know How to
Love Him" from her album of
the same name. (I must empha-
size right now that this is not
the cut taken from the album
Jesus Christ: Superstar and
sung by Yvonne Elliman.)

I was in an apartment house.
I had just spent the night sleep-
ing on a hard mattress on the
floor. when I awoke, shivering
cold. to a grey, rainy day and
the pungent odor of an unchang-
ed cat box.

My friends had instilled in
me the possibility of cockroach-
es crawling out of the base-
boards and making a home in my
hair: I was hungry and I didn’t
know when I was getting home.
In the midst of all this, a new
version of a favorite song echo-
ed out of the transister radio
nestled beside me. Somehow it
fitmy mood. too.

I listened to all of it, but this
new version was much too sac-

 

REDDY: Not Ready

charine to suit me. I couldn't
stomach it, and yelled my dis-
taste. Such a bittersweet, pow-
erful song has no business being
done in the manner of some love-
sick school girl.

So when I received the album.
and took a deep breath. I thought.
"Ah yes. that Helen Reddy!".
and thought back to the cats and
the gloom.

But when I glanced over the
titles of the other songs on the al-
bum. I forgot my bad first im-

Robertson said the commuters
would be offered the new possibil-
ity of purchasing a ticket good for
seven dinners.

Housing Director John Vrana
was questioned regarding the pos-
sibility of granting resident stu-
dents the option of foregoing a
meal ticket.

He said that such a move "would
not be feasible." since the Uni-
versity might then face difficulty

in meeting overhead costs on ‘

campus dining facilities.

He suggested. however. that a
no-meal-ticket option for dorm
residents might be possible some-
time in the future.

The album listed hit after hit,

Staff Columnist

The purpose of .my last arti-
cle was to question whether we

could afford to hire any new-
. employees (black or white) for

the Housing Office.‘ I do admit
we need more black and" even
women administrators through-
out the university.

But we should not hire these
new people for the purpose of

window dressing. They -should

not simply be added on by in-
creasingthe present staff size
which would increase costs.
Instead they should -be hired to
fill vacancies in existing posi-

tions.

Plus, we should notirecruit
new administrators just to work
for black or women students.
If these people are to be hired,
they should be qualified and
able to work with all students.
We can‘t afford less. '

Well, I learned in some friend- I

ly criticism from Dan McFad-
den, Executive Assistant .Vice
Chancellor of Student Affairs,
that his office and the Housing

administrator will fill a vacancy
that will soon exist in the Hous-
ing Office. ,

John Vrana, the Housing Dir-
ector, is trying to find a quali-
fied person "who will work for
everybody.” .McFadden explain-
ed that the new black adminis-
trator will "deal with black and
white students and will be an
asset to the Housing staff."

& McFadden also told me how
Vrana is trying to do more to cut
costs and improve services.» The

Housing Office has, in the past '

year. reduced the number of head
residents from 9 to 3. Some Re-

sident Assistants will now dou-
ble up with other students in

rooms which makes more bed
spaceavailable. This extra space
last year generated an extra
$70,000 in revenues.

There are also future plans to
cut the number of RA’s _ in
half to cut costs further. Plus
the Housing Office is trying
to increase services by establish-

‘ing a new post that will deal

with student off-campus housing
problems.

stated, “The last two rate in-

creases were in response to wage

increases won by the’ union
working in the dorms." He feels

the big cost in housing here has ‘ '

been the result of satisfying the
needs and demands of the un-
ions. But he feels confident that

‘Vrana is doing a_good job in

stabilizing costs to a point where
we don’t have to expect “an
increase
least the next 3 years.”

All of this is good news. But .

we should also realize we are
now paying $152 a month for
dorm rooms, which is the second
highest rate in the country; (We
pay $650 a term for room and
board). " “

This piece of bad news was
revealed in a surveytconducted
by the Housing Office, which
included some Ivy League col-
leges. So there is probably much
more that can bedone in Hous-
ing to reduce costs further.

But there is "hope. At the end
of my interview, McFadden said,
"We should reduce staff size

Editor.

I would like to take this opportun-
ity to add some more valid informa-

tion to that of the article written by

Mr. Mike Haley on May 27.

Mr. Haley seems to be somewhat
engrossed with the idea of hiring a
black administrator i_n the housing of-

I ' fice. When he states the hiring of ad-
administrators is,

ditional qualified
directly associated with Pitt‘s exces-
sive dorm costs, he completely negates
other factors such as food costs, linen
service. cost. of maintaining rooms,
that are major contributors to the uni-
versity housing costs.

Mr. Haley has been overly "gener-
alistic with the concept of maintaining
the status quo in the housing office; I

wonder what he would have said if con-3

cerned white RATS would have asked
for additional administrators _to deal
with the ‘complexities ‘that arej associat-

_ ed with operating a large housing com,-_jl
. f”;p1ex- such" as the _Univ'ersity" of . Pitts-

 

dices.

 

In other ways,-.the humanness of millions of
other women is exploited daily. From fashion to
the role in the family, social guidelines have»
been established. There is ‘seldom any time for
a women to develop the “person,” only time to
follow the feminine norms that hubby and Saks ,
Fifth Avenue have cooked up for the “little
woman.” ' i ’

The sexist cycle that causes these types-of
exploitation cannot be stopped easily, however.
For not «only must the attitudes of men tow-
ard women be changed, but women's attitudes of
themselves must undergo some revamping. '

Women must realize that they can reject’

‘the present norms and. in turn, form new ones
for themselves and their children; They must
realize that they have the right to be more than
a sex object or a market to peddle the latest
fashion styles. They must stop reinforcing the
sexism that is already present in this country by
ceasing to participatein all sexist ventures”.

. - And maybe. just maybe, thenext time KQV
has -a Hot Pants contest, there will be no contes-
tants to playtheir silly game — just some very

stunned promotion men wondering what to do
now that they‘re going to be fired. "

I do not believe that the black RA‘s
were requesting just a “black face" in
the housing office. I think they are
asking for someone to be responsive
to the total needs of resident students
in the university.

. It is my opinion that a black admin-
istrator would substantially reduce some
of the misunderstandings that are pre-

valent in the housing. office dealings"

with black students.

If Mr. Haley is so concerned about
reducing costs, why doesn’t he request
students, to give up some of the serv-
ices that are offered by the university
housing office.

I wonder why people with ideas si-
milar to those of Mr. Haley have al-
ways been the roadblocks to any effec-
tive and -real change in our society? If
the university -followed the logic‘ of

'' those like Mr. Haley, it‘would never

change; and probably ‘would. ‘remain
stagnant and‘ die.frorn its ovv_n,,p1jej.u-

example of his work. it is hard not to become a fan
and ardent admirer. He is a rarety among directors
in Pittsburgh for he is consistently fine.

The actors for the most part are wellicast. In the
central role of Joe is Bert Nemitz who delivers a
skillfully rich and compassionate performance.
Joining him is Bill Becze who brightens and at
times delicately overwhelms the stage with a mas-
terful performance as Tom. Both he and Nemitz
are consistent in characterizations that are well
defined, well balanced and beautifully created.

Henry Luba. as Nick. makes a rewarding debut

er...‘ a major role for the University Theatre He

gives a performance that is savory and delightful
in style and delivery. Dan Frezza once again re-
turns to Fosters stage after too long an absence.
His role as Kit Carson is one of the major high-
lights of the evening.

In the role of Kitty, Paula Stuart delivers a
fine portrayl in her first major performance. Her
beautiful expression brings the right amount of
troubled innocence to her role . . . her delivery is
usually on key. Larry Cervi as Harry and Jeff Bou-
dov as Dudley provide fine performances in major
supporting roles.

In addition, William Keyes (Arab), Francine Ne-
mitz (Mary L.), Alan Calcagni (McCarthy), Kathy
DeVecka (Elsie), Richard Ruben (Willie) and Gary
Vigland (whose performance was only midly satis-

fying but promising)round off the list of notable con-
tributors in minor but well done portrayals.

Kenneth Neal. Sherri Speer. Patrick Carroll.
Bruce Abrams. Mary Jacobs-Ford. Judith Galardi.
Linda Loxterman. Francis Roefaro and Ronald
Sopyla pretends to be a combination of Jonathan
Winters and Paul Lynd in this and every past part
I've seen him in. He might do much better if he
would try to learn to act instead of wasting his
time doing poor imitations.

Settings by Henry Heymann and costumes by
Lynne R. Hemingway are outstanding. Lighting by
Richard Evans is the best I‘ve seen all season at
the University ‘Theatre. The hidden piano playing
of James Agnew gives delightful sounds.

Saroyan ends his prologue with these words:
“In the time of your life, live so that in that won-
drous time you shall not add to the misery and sor-
row of the world, but shall smile to theinfinite de-
light and mystery of it.”

See The Time of Your Life. It is a remarkable
play which. under Curt Canfields direction. is
well deserved reward to all those who. as Saroyan
did. can hope to be a part of life‘s totality and re-

{ain an unsoiled spirit throughout the time of their
ives.

Choral Groups llllerge

To Form Pitt Singers

by SID WERNER

Some people are fine singers. others are mediocre and still
others are so poor you wonder if they can shatter the porcelain of

their bathtubs.

For the many people possessing good voices. practice is impor-
tant. So for the satisfaction of those students who enjoy singing the
University provides the Glee Club. the Heinz Chapel Choir and the

Womens Chorale.

Under the direction of Phillip
Cavanaugh of the Music Depart-
ment, the singers meet three
times a week. Choice of music is
generally left to the discretion of
the group, though Cavanaugh
says he has the group do pieces
from Schubert and a few masses
to brush up on their classical rep-
erto’ire.

The structure of the organiza-
tion is loose as is suggested by
their optional attendance policy.
Usually. there are about ten or
12 people participating.

Although there was an effort
to publicize the group. there were
not enough responses to warrant
any concerts. Therefore. the ori-
entation of the singers is for prac-
tice and enjoyment. In line with
this approach. Cavanaugh says
his goal is “not to polish the sing-

ers. but merely to introduce

new material to them and to.

go over a few of the old stan-
dardsf‘

The reaons for singing vary
from person to person and from
group to group. For some it may-
be an emotional release. for
others a profession. For the Pitt
Singers music is enjoyment and
that is the basis for their organ-
ization.'

IN THE April 29 edition of the

versity Calendar Events listed

sions" as open to the public. .

battling it out to be top man in the highjump.

Wilborne and Thompson

though different in physical
appearence apparently are equal
as far as their ability to high
jump go. Both athletes have been

“Well, I wouldn’t call it an in-

squad lacked confidence in Mike
Niccols‘ pitching this season.
or the junior righthander was
blessed with the perfect spot in
the pitching rotation.

In all but one of Mikes starts
this spring. the ”team supplied
ample support at the plate to
give him comfortable working
margins. He combined his good
fortune with excellent pitching
to compile a 5-1 record and a
remarkable ERA of 1.79.

His only loss came to Penn
State when he was lifted in the
fourth inning trailing 2-0.

“I don’t know why,” Mike
laughed about the team’s scoring,
“but I was real happy about it.
It took a lot of pressure \off me.
It seems like Ken Macha always
homered for me."

In the past three years as a
Panther hurler. Niccols racked
up a 10-4 mark with not one
loss at home. His ERA hovered
around the 1.5 limit for the
period. Coach Bobby Lewis used
Niccols primarily against the
tougher teams for the last two
seasons.

When Mike entered Pitt three
years ago. he joined the base-
ball team with four ambitions.
He split even with his aspira-
tions. M

“It would havebeen nice to
pitch’ a college no-hitter, “Mike
said. “The one goal which I

1really wanted was for the team

to make the NCAA playoffs,
which we didn’t do.” V

Ace righthander Mike Niccols his favorite pitch, a slider against
Allegheny College in the last game of the season two weeks ago.
Niccols, the top hurler on the Panther staff, racked up a 5-1 record
and a 1.79 ERA.

Mike achieved his hopes of es-
tablishing a_ winning record at
Pitt and this year he attained
his final goal. that of being nam-
ed to the Tri-State all-star team.

Unfortunately. Niccols will be
ineligible to play next year for
the same reason that sidelined
Jerry Richey and Bryant Salter
from the outdoorit-rack season. '

Mike pitched in his freshman
year, before the NCAA allowed
baseball players four years of
competition.

“I would rather have sat out
last year -instead of my senior
year." states Niccols. “I would
love to pitch against UCLA who
we play next year-then I could
really see what I‘m made out
of.“

Niccols considers his best game
while at Pitt to be a three-hit
shutout of West Virginia when
he was a freshman. “It was my
first start here and then again
it was beating the Mountain-
eersf'

Despite his
spring, Mike wants to assist Lew-
is with the pitching staff and
hopes to be drafted by a major
league team next January.

Although Mike had the op-
portunity to sign with the Cin-
cinnati Reds after a brilliant
high school career in Philadel-
phia. he is glad. he chose to
come to Pitt.

“I know that there are a lot
of guys that don't make it in
the majors and this way I'll
have a better chance to get a job
if I can't get on a team." ‘

For the remginder of the sum-
mer, Mike will pitch for the
Monroeville Maulers in league
play. Several other Panther mit-
ters are members of the local

squad.
If the rest of the Maulers fol-
low the Panthers‘ lead. the

teams opponents will find Nic-

‘_-cols a hard pitcher to beat.

300 Poverty-A reri
Youngsters To Join
In Sports Program

Three hundred local youngsters will have an opportunity this sum-
mer to participate in the National Summer Youth Sports Program. The
1971 program will operate in a record 64 cities and 34 states and on

110 campuses this year.

Pitt is one of the 110 schools that will offer its facilities
to the local community. Nationwide the program has served the needs
of 85.000 poverty-area kids during its first two summers of opera-
tion and will probably entertain close to 60.000 youngsters this

year.

Pittsburgh natives will be screened by the programs officials.

Taylor Tompkins is directing the program in the Steel City. He will

have the use of Trees Hall, both
the gym and the pool in order to
give the youths instruction on

swimming. gymnastics. basket-
ball and baseball.
According to Dr. William

Exum, chairman of the NSYSP
Committee, “We should gain from
past experience. I think some of
the programs improved 50 to 100
per cent last year. We expect the
same improvement this summer.”

President Nixon has released
$3 million in federal funds for
the program.

Your body has remarkable re-
cuperative powers when left
alone. The popular mistaken
concept is that we cannot gain
strength and build resistance
unless we eat. So long as this
illusion persists, thousands will
go to premature graves. Food
and nutrition are mt synony-
mous. You are not nourished
by the food you gag, but in
proportion to the amount you
g_igest and assimilate. Through
the ages man has lasted and
regained health, peace of mind
and a new way of life. Recently
in America there has been keen
observance and interest in the
splendid results attained by
fasting.
