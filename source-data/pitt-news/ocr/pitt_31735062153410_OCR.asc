Many people thought they would be early if they arrived on the scene at
1:30 p. m., one hour before the battle, but they were greatly surprised to
ﬁnd themselves in that ﬁfteen-person thick jam before the turnstiles. At
the northwest reserved seat section even prior to the opening of the gate,
the people were raving to gain entrance and being told than; it was not
time yet, waited about for admittance.

MISS Lucie WILL
ADDRESS (ASSEMBLY

At the assembly next Friday -at
11:30 A. ML Miss Katherine Locks! of
Youngstown, 0., will deliver hope of
her famous current topic lectures.
Miss Lo-ckje‘ delivers these lectures
in Philadelphia, ‘Detroit, Cleveland
and Pittsburgh, and the audiences in
each town are growing larger from
week to week. The particular theme
for next Friday will be “The Balkan

Situation,” and it will be interesting
to every student of present day his-
tory.

Inasmuch as these topics are always
before audiences that have paid for

‘admission, it is certain that the best
way of. showing_»Miss Locke due ap-

preciation will be to have a record-
breaking attendance in Memorial'Hall
next Friday.

If the interest in this topic is suffi-
cient to warrant it, there will be a
course of topics given -at the Univer-
sity during the year. , :

Economics " Reception
Precedes Big Game

 

 

With lots of Pitt “pep” and happi-
ness in their heants, the students of
_the Sch-ool of Economics departed
from Trees Gymnasium,-Friday night,
after having attended the initial re-
ception given to the new students of
that school. It was one of the‘ most
successful receptions ever given by a
school of the University and the
‘freshmen went home feeling as if they
were now acquainted with every up-
perclassman in the School of Engi-
neering.

The Economics senate had charge
of the affair and the president, Albert
S. Yoder, presided. The bon-ﬁre that
was being held on the Stadium, at-
tracted the students in the earlier
part of the evening but at 8:30 the
"dancing began and “Economicers" ga-
lore poured‘ imto the gymnasium. Of

course they ' were accompanied by
their best girls. .

SGHENLEYBNI FEB. 18
TO BE SCENE OF PROM

Wednesday, February 16, was the
date chosen for the Junior Prom at a
regular meeting held at the Phi Zeta
Phi fraternity house Monday even-
ing. Norman M_acL.eod, general chair-
man, presiding. A

The Hotel Schenley beingpthe most
suitable for the occasion, both because
of its nearness to the University and
because of its prestige, was the unani-
.mous choice of the whole committee.

After a discussion by the committee
as to the day, Friday, it was learned
that Friday February 11, and Friday
February 18 could not be had due to
these dates already being taken by
Carnegie Tech and Pennsylvania
State Normal respectively. It was
then that Wednesday was suggested
by Chairman MacLeod. The committee
chose this date after being ‘shown that
it would no doubt be suitable to the
majority of the student body, having
‘no previous obstacles in the way, even
the basket ball team, being able to
come.

 

NORMAN ANGEl[ IS
pohlusiggunvensliv

journalist, author and advocate of
peace,‘ wiil speak at the student as-
sembly of the University of Pittsburgh
in Soldiers’ ‘Memorial the morning of
November 19. The meeting will be
open free to the public. Mr. Angell’s
best ‘known book is “The Great Illu-
sionf’, His most recent production is
“The World’s Highway.”

Mr. Angel} was born in England, but
spent a large part of his early life in
'the.United »States. He took up news-
paper work and for several years was
Paris correspondent of American news-
papers. He came to the United States
several months ago, and gave a series
of lectures at Cornell University on
“International Relations.” He has lec-
tuned before many other gatherings
since. _ .

. The address at the University will
be the only one he will deliver in
Pittsburgh. He will be entertained by
Chancellor S-. B. McCormick. Mem-
bers of the Pittsburgh branch of the
Arbitration and Peace Society will
give a dinner in Mr. Angell’s’ honor.

Musical   Clubs

With the passing of the ﬁrs-t month
of school work in the University, the
preliminary work of the Musical Clubs
is about completed and from now on
the -(efforts of the candidates will be
directed along more specialized lines.
*"”"'*This”"‘"'prelimnary' period furnishes
materal for the prediction that the
Musical Clubs will have the most suc-
cessful year in the experience of the
organization. it

Two. years ago, the Musical Clubs
was established upon a more sound
footing than in.the past by the adop-
tion of a constitution and the secur-

visor. Through the untiring efforts
and wise counsel of this one man, the
organization has been brought out of
.‘debt, has established a reputation as
‘;the best club in. the University, and

cognition from -the outside world.
Before all the student activities were
placed under the control of the Ad-
visory Board to Student Activities, the
«Musical Clubsihad a hard struggle to
make both‘ ends meet. This was due
to lack of student support and mis-
management. Since that time-, how-
‘ever, the clubs have had some ﬁnan-
cial foundation for the work of the
‘year; and greater results can be
accomplished. .
Under the new arrangement, the or-
ganization receive $1,000 a. year from
the advisory board, which also author-

ness of the clubs. This prohibits the
signing of any. unfavorable contracts
which might have disastrous ﬁnancial
results. 2 . . ‘_

Another good effectof-= the board is
the regulation concerning the scholar-
ship of the candidates. If amember
‘falls down in his studies, he is im-
vmediately dropped from the club. In
this way, only those students who can
keep up in thier work can remain in
the organization, so: that a greater de-

ing of Louis J. Heath as Faculty Ad-

bids fair to receive unqualiﬁed re-V

izes all contracts, trips an_d other busi- :

gpendence can be placed on the mem-
‘bers. ' p

The constitution, as adopted in May
1914, provides for a permanent organ-
ization for the years to come. The
position of manager is acquired
through a period of competition cov-
..9’.1‘in:g- three years. Any. regular mem-
ber of the Sophomore class, in good
standing, regardless of his musical
ability, is eligible to compete for the
position of Assistant Manager.:During
the third week of school, a. call is
issued for competitiors who report for
the manager. He assigns all work and
keeps a record of the same, which is
presented to the advisory board and
the club in‘ May. The standing of the
competitors is arranged on a percent-
age basis of the work done. From
this list of competitors, the Assistant
Managers are chosen. Then follows
another year of competitive work after
which the ﬁnal choice of manager is
made.‘

The ﬁnal manager is very ably qual-
iﬁed for the duties and work of the

their goal. -But_their efforts were unavailing. The closest they were able
to get the coveted goal, was once when Wesbecker intercepted a forward
pass of Williamson’s and carried it to the [20 yard line. On the next play
the ball was fumbled for an instant and Herron, following the ball like a
hawk, gathered it in and sped 76 yards for a touchdown.

MhP P d ° ti
P'tt’

Did anyone ever come out with the
statement that Pitt didn't have any
“PEP”? Well ‘we think that an
apology is‘due the University of Pitts-
burgh student body. To use the words
of one of Pitt’s“ noted alumnus “Pitt
has gone n1a.d,‘the students beginning
Friday morning are raving maniacs
and I should think that it will take a
few weeks for some of Pitt’s,1oyalites
to be able again to indulge in the art
of speaking the English language
above a whisper.” «

The rooting began with the “Mass”
meeting that was declared the. best
ever by every upper classman of the
University on» Friday morning. En-
thusiasm. reigned supreme with every
freshman, sophomore, junior and se-
nior on the job to show the team that
they were there with the spirit.

The ﬁreworks were begun by Di-
rector of Athletics Charles Miller, fol-
lowed by Captain “Chalky” William-

son, who predicted that Pitt is going
to-win. He spoke of the good» team.

 

Pitt had and how proud’they were of
being backed up by such loyal Pit-

torium that morning. “I-lube” Wagner,
Pitt’s 1913 captain, gave the student
body a talk on “What I expect Pitt
to do to Wash-Jeff”. This was fol-

ers and now secretary for the Y. M.
and the shots from the canton of

“Pop” Haslett, of Pitt’s cheering re-
nown. He awakened the student body

the “g.rads”.are comingpinto the fold
at a very encouraging clip. The week
of the W.*—& J. game hundreds : of

that about all they could do was to
hand out tickets and receive the pay-

during the lullsp to “talk up” the
Alumni Association: The men spoken

to were usually responsiveand the re-

After the football season, it is th

every. “grad” who purchased tickets
during the season, as a; careful. record
was kept of them. They will be shown
the advantages of alumni member-

last« year with very good ‘results.

In the meantime, alumni who are in

the fold are .-reminded that they should_ I
Lneveroverlook apchance to secure a

member." When a friend of classmate
is met, who isn’t in, the first question
should be “Do you get the PITT-

négative then the’ retort should be
“Why not join the Alumni Association

for a. touchdown.

Scenes of bedlam
broke loose-, and while the crowd. was
yelling themselves hoanse, Fry kicked‘
goal, This proved to be the winning
touc.hdown,,for Pitt had a lease on all
the scoring for the.‘after£oon..

P. HeymEin*—0utpunted

Tshe punters on both [sides were
clearly oﬂ form. The ﬁerce playing .
on both sides ‘caused the kicking
game to be resorted to frequently.
Heyman was outpunted by an aver-
age of almostflive yards by the Pitt
hooters. However, this may be V ex-
plained in part by the low passes that
he received from the centen. Fry’s
punt from. the 48-yard" line and out of

_ bounds on the six-yard’ line was the

longest and the best -of the afternoon.
Pitt’s one attempt at the side kick
failed completely and was only re-
sorted to once. ' P '
“Hastings tried twice to boot the ‘pig;
skin between the bars and both times
just missed registering by inches. 6His
ﬁrst attempt was from the 30-yard
line and to many in the crowd it ap-
peared that it passed between the up-
rights. However, the referee decided
otherwise and the points were disal-

‘lowed. Again in the second quarter

he narrowly missed another attempt
at the south posts- Washington and
Jefferson's sole attempt was one from
the 55-yard line that went Wide when
Heyman washurried by a bad pass
from the center. . P I
First Half scoreless

Theﬁrst half witnessed the local
eleven conserving their strength and
being contented inbreaking up their
opponents’ overhead attempts. It
seemed to many in the crowd that the i
teams were evenly ma 7 d- Many
looked for a. scoreless r’ ult. Others
thought that luck would-‘ prove. to be
the deciding elpment. However, they
had ‘failed toftake into account the
resourcefulness of the Pitt mentor,
Glenn Warner. It was under his ord-

ers that the game had been conduct-

ed as it was. At only one time had
anything been tried and that was
when Williamson took a long chance
and got away with it. The ball was
on the 22-yard line and fourth down‘
i Williamson idno-pped
back to kick and instead of kicking,
hurled the inﬂated oval thirty’ yards
down the ﬁeld intothe‘ waiting arms
of “Jimmy" DeHart. It wasthe pret-

tiest pass that was pulled off in the

entire game. . \

Pitt Tackles Strong A .

Thornhill and Hockensmith played
their men to a standstill and seven
yards was the total advancement made
thnu their positions. Sutherland and
Soppitt were not far behind the tack-
les‘ in eﬂiciency, sixteen yards repre-
senting the total gain thru their part
of the line. Hermon and Carlson both
held the Red and Black backﬁeld dnen
to little onno gains. S_ies also played
a good game while he was in.
 Williamson, DeHart, Hastings, Fry
and M-cNulty all played the game of
their lives. Their work ;in breaking
up the forward pass was a revelation
to all who‘ witnessed the game. Wil-
liamson’s selection of plays places him
among the best ﬁeld generals that
ever run a Goldand Blue machine. It
is hard to pick outta single manand,
give him anywhere near a preference
over his fellows for what they did

ing when .the*sc»ore was .a. tie’ and vi -

game. Pitt’s famous running attack
‘here showed to? it’s best ‘advantage
and there was no stopping it. Run-V‘
ning interference for Hastings o-n his
59 yard ‘run was no less than six of
his ‘ team mates who took out’ man
after man’ who attempted to stop the
‘runner. Herron, who has been men-
tioned‘ by many of the eastern critics
for the mythical All-American, again
“played a. most sensational game. His
recovery of .Sto»bb’s attempted forward
pass and his outdzlstancing the fast
W. & J. men who attempted to catch
him, marked, the second touchdown
for the Un«ive-rsityéteam and practical-
ly settled the game. _ _ , ” 

The third period marked fall the
scoring made during. the entire game.
Closely following Herroirs long run

bration. The Pitt band‘ was also on
deck to lead-in the sin.ging.a,nc1 to do

crowd dispersed at an early hour, so

.- Saturday Night , s T -.

The Alvinfrheatre was the.‘ scene of

 Pitt’-so -=1-festivity--4 on ‘.Sa;turdi§§y "night.-~

Although the fplayers’ boxes were
decorated with no banners, the lead-
ing actors with armbands and pennants
appeared in the scenario wearing both
the Pitt and Wash-Jeff colors. This
made up for), the missing’ decorated
boxes usually visible to the Pitt stu-
dents, after a W..& J .. and State game.
At the ﬁnish’ of the ﬁrst. act°Con-

gressman James Francis Burke pre-
sented the large; trophy, for two
years in the handsof the Washington
Countians, to Pitt’s captain, who made
an address praising the clean sports-
manship of the W. & _J. squad and the
flghiipthat they displayed during the
whole game. A V .

The Big Snake Dance ~ ,
Everybody seemed‘ to be in it.
Over 1250‘ students participated in
what may be called the biggest cele-
bration the University of Pittsburgh
ever had. , The students, after gather-
ing at both State and Thaw halls,
seemed to disperse to all sections of
the campus tvhati to a spectator’s view-
point the crowd seemed very small.
The co-eds of the University. are to

be ‘congratulated at the amount- of
“Pep” they showed Monday morning.
As was remarked by a few freshmen,
their cheerleader, ‘Miss Edith Hart,
ought to be elevated unanimously to
the place of head cheerleader. This
morning at the mass meeting of the
co-ed body’ on “the steps of Thaw Hall,
Pitt’s new cheerleader. could. be seen
going through all sgrts of maneuvers
in, a great endeavor of lmaking the
members of her group shower the
worthy football warriors” with cheers.
They not only cheered but they show-
ed somethiﬂg in the ‘form of spirit
downtown with the boys, yelling and
shrieking, while they were indulging

. in the task of snake dancing.

It~was almost half way into town
thatlan Forbes, Pitt’s ndted bystander
on “The rules of the game” proved
himself the hero of the hour. While

‘ marching in line- with the rest of his

fellow students, he noticed a. wagon
load of freshmen being hauled‘ into‘
town. He politely asked them to leave
the wagon and walk to town with the
rest of the freshmen, whom he claimed
were showing true Pitt spirit. They
refused to walk. It was then that a
crowd of sophomores led byllan imme-
diately began hurling the freshmen
to the hard bricks below. They soon

‘.‘So'm.eone ought to lecture to those

member of the -senior class. “I think
it .a great honor to help in the cele-
bation of this victory, because I know
that during my four years‘ in school I
have waited for this lone day when I
might rejoice in -the victory of my

John Spargo, noted author and lec-
turer, spoke before the Socialist Study
class last Monday morning on the
“Real Meaning of Socialism.” In spite
of the football celebration, a large
number of students, faculty members
and friends of the University made up
an audience which ﬁlled the chapel

in Thaw Hall. Following the lecture.

an open discussion was carried on by
those present.

 

‘v. M. C. A.

That the Y. M. C. A. has made
"rapid strides of progress during «the
first month of the present school year
is evidenced by the first monthly re-
port of the organization which -Gener-
al .Secretary,‘Geo-rge M. Kirk, submit-
ted to the Chancellor last week.

' The work as ithas progressed so
far, is very encouraging, and begun
in nearly all of the divisions of the
activity of the association. The mis-
sionary work is practically“ conﬁned
to the Pitkin club and the Student
Volunteer Band, which have held
meetings every‘ week. This work
was aided by the visit of R0b61‘t M-
Russell, Traveling Secretary of the
Student" Volunteer Movement.

The deputation work has been car-
ried on to the extent of. six meetings
being held in the pulpits and Young
People’s Societies in the near vicin-
ity. C ‘

At least ten men are engaged in
active social service work in Trinity
Chapel, Soho, Woods. Run, and the Y.
M». C. A. branches at Hill Top, East
Liberty and Stockton Avenue.

The membership is 160. Many new
members were secured through the
Freshman campaign. ’Wi«thin the next
week or so, a campaign will be in-
auguratedin the upper classes; and
it is hoped that the 500 mark will be
reached in the membership of the or-
ganization." '

The temperance committee was
aided in the organization of its work
by the visit of W. Everett Baker,
Traveling Secretary of the Intercol-
legiate Prohibition Association. Mr.
Baker met with the members of the
organization here, and discussed plans
for the carrying on of the work.

The bible study plan is still in the
embryonic state, as nothing deﬁnite
has been _started. A delegation will

be sent to Grove City Conference of-

the Student Volunteer Band next week.
G. C. MIeMilla.n, J. D. Stark, H. N.
Mawhinney, and Ray Howe will be the
delegates at the meetings.

The average attendance for the
month was 90. This is high because
of the large attendance at the first
meeting.

The social committee has arranged
a stag party for November 19 at the
gymnasium. Swimming, athletic and
gymnastic exhibitions will be held and
a large number of the studen‘ts‘will
probably attend. For December, the
committee has arranged a joint social
with the Y. W. C. A.

Next week’ will be one of prayer.
Every weekday, there will be service
at 12:30, except Monday when the
meeting will be held in connection
with the regular meeting of the as-
sociation at 11:30. D1‘.-.»..Hugh T._ Kerr
of the Shadyside Presbyterian church
will preside. Voluntary prayer Cir-
cle wil be held every Tuesday at 10:30.

To the Juniors, prepare to part

. with $5.00; to the other classes, have

a dollar ready, for the “Owl” mana-
gers are coming to" you for the ad-

vance money for this year’s annual;

Beginning yesterday, the men who
will control the ﬁnances of the book,
started out for subscriptions whereby

' they will raise the guarantee fund be-

fore any deﬁnite work on the pub-
lication can be begun. The subscrip-
tion blanks were distributed to the

various schools by Manager W. C.-

Arthur and Controller W. T. Canan.

As in previous‘ years, the regular
fee for the Jun.iors,will be $5.00. This
includes a book, a picture and an in-
dividual writeup. For the Seniors and
underclassmen, the price of the book
is $2.00, half of which sum is paid
now and the remainder when the
book is received. The Advisory Board
of Student Activities sets a certain
sum. which must be raised before ac-
tive work on the publication may be
started; -and the managers must rely,
on the generous. response of the stu-
dents to -secure this amount.

The editorial staﬁhas met several
times, and the size and style of the
book have been deﬁnitely decided up-
on. The size will be exactly the same
as last year, with the exception of
the number of pages, which will be
larger. Only the details are to be
worked out. ‘ «

All students wishing to do art work
shouldsee Miss Louise iMoye as soon
as possible.
