reclassifying 11 departments that had
been facing reductions was delivered to
the provost late yesterday afternoon.
However, program chairs said they had
not yet received copies of the document.

Provost James Maher was unavail-
able for comment or conﬁrmation.

Peter Koehler, dean of the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences, said chairs would get
copies of the ﬁnal draft and a personal
letter from him detailing the reasons
behind their new placement this week.

Dean's office delays distributing department revisions

“The proposals will be bound and
sent to the department chairs [Monday]
afternoon,” Koehler said Sunday
evening. “It may take a day or two to
write all those letters, though. So don’t
make it sound  like they should expect
the letters.” A °

Some department chairs said they
had called the dean’s ofﬁce yesterday to
try to get a copy and discovered it was
not yet complete.

“They said the text wasn’t ﬁnished,”
said David Birnbaum, the Slavic depart-
ment chair. “In the e-mail that [Koehler]
sent me, he had said that the report
would be shared with chairs, and his tar-

said] they intended to ﬁnish it today, that

when to expect it, but said it wouldn’t be
today.”

French and Italian chair Dennis
Looney said he also contacted the dean’s
office.

“I called down there [at 3 p.m. on
Monday], and I was told  [the copies]
weren’t ready yet,” Looney said. “We
haven’t gotten it.” .

Looney said ofﬁcials in the dean’s
ofﬁce could not tell him when to expect
a copy.

The draft moves the language
departments and linguistics out of ﬁring
range for now; However, it still leaves
geology, religious studies, theater arts,
classics, and sociology in a new catego-
ry: departments in transition.

According to the report, this status
means the departments have either
recently made changes to their programs
or need to.

Department chairs declined com-
ment on the document itself, choosing to
remain silent until they had seen it for
themselves. ‘

Cooling head trauma victims
prevents brain damage

   

After years of speculation and
failed therapies, a key treatment for
severe head trauma has been proven
effective.

Researchers at UPMC have dis-
covered that cooling the brain after it
has been severely traumatized can
improve the chances of a complete
recovery. This treatment, termed by
doctors as hypothermia, simply
involves cooling the body to 87 or 88
degrees Fahrenheit for 24 hours -after
the head trauma occurs.

“This treatment can lead to
improved patient recovery with less
permanent disability,” said Dr.
Donald Marion, chief of Pitt’s neuro-

 

trauma services, and the head of this
study.

Brain damage due to severe head
trauma is responsible for major dis-
abilities such as paralysis, impaired
or severed speech, and memory loss.
The discovery that hypothermia can
help prevent these disabilities was
published in the February 17, 1997,
edition of the New England Journal
of Medicine.

The article described how the
technique reduces swelling of the
brain due to inflammation, as well as
inhibits the flow of neurochemicals,
such as glutamate, which kill brain
cells and lead to permanent brain
damage.

“This treatment can be compared

Supreme Court says scrambled sex

Around the World

CANBERRA, Australia — Australia is
moving to get rid of the world’s only
euthanasia law.

The Australian Senate voted today to
overturn the law in one of the country’s
territories. The repeal measure already
passed t.e Australian House of
Representatives.

The law lets terminally ill patients
commit suicide with a doctor’s help. The
law took effect last year, and since then,

- four people have taken their lives under its

provisions.

Under Australia’s system of govem-
ment, the national parliament has the con-
stitutional right to strike down territorial
and state legislation.

HEBRON, West Bank —— Palestinian
police are moving to end violence in the
West Bank.

Yesterday, Palestinian police formed a
human chain and fired into the air in
Hebron. They were trying to keep
Palestinian protesters away from Israeli
troops. It was the first time in several days
that Palestinian police have taken action to
end the stone throwing.

Israel has accused Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and his security forces of
encouraging violence against Israel. But
the chief of West Bank security says his
forces are in the street trying to control the
situation, not stir up trouble.

Across the Nation

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Yesterday’s
unanimous ruling by the Supreme Court
means Playboy TV and other sex channels
must be completely covered up —electroni-
cally speaking —— for nonsubscribers. ’

Playboy Entertainment had asked the
justices to block enforcement of a new feder-
al law while they challenge its constitutional-
ity in the courts.

The law requires cable TV companies to
impose complete blackouts on adult channels
for nonsubscribers, or air the channels only at
night Many parents complained their chil-
dren were still able to get an eyeful and ear-
fI1l of sex while watching partially scrambled
sex channels.

LOS ANGELES, Ca. — The National
Enquirer may be headed for hot water again.
Bill and Camille Cosby are threatening
to sue the paper over an article that suggests
they hired a gunman to ﬁnd their son’s killer.
Cosby spokesman David Brokaw said they
are demanding an apology and a correction.

Brokaw accused the tabloid of not doing
enough research and says the Cosbys would
never resort to taking the law into their own
hands.

The Enquirer stands by its story and
said the couple hired a private investigating
ﬁrrnwhichislicensedtocarryanduseguns.

Ennis Cosby was shot to death along a
Los Angeles highway in January. Though an
18-year-old suspect has been charged in the
case, he has not yet entered a plea.

Fraternities

Pasquinucci said this was the push for
the desire to ban alcohol from Phi Delta
Theta.

To make the transition easier and
begin sooner, incentives such as dis-
counts on insurance and possible grants
for improvements to the residences will
be offered. The only incentive Pitt’s
chapter has been offered so far is lower
insurance rates when it makes the
change.

“Not every stu-
dent is coming to
school to drink,”
Pasquinucci, said.
“Some are looking
for those [fratemi—
ties] that are alco-
hol—free.”

How will this
affect future recruit-

ing?
According to
Rosensteel, rush _

will be affected, but
it’s too soon to tell
whether the effect will be positive or
negative. Alcohol will not be permitted
on the premises when the policy goes
into effect even if members are over 21.

The only place alcohol will be
allowed is at events that take place in a
bar or restaurant. This is what is called
a third—party vendor. What makes this
situation favorable is that the fraternity
is not liable for what might happen
when a social event is held by a third-
party vendor.

Phi Delta Theta alumni also have an

opinion on the fraternity’s transition.

Jeff Massanova is an alumnus from
Kent State.

Socializing is a big part of a frat,
but Massanova believes this can be
done without alcohol. He agrees that a
major reason to ban alcohol is because
of the liability costs.

“People say, oh, you’re buying your
friends when you join a fraternity, when
the reality is the
money goes to lia-
bility insurance,”
Massanova said. He
said he had more
fun doing communi-
ty services with his
brothers than get-
, ting drunk together
and not remember-
_ ing what had hap-
'  pened.

:9 M a s s a n o v a
_, said that men whc

- want to join a frater-
‘ nity just to drink are
weeded out during pledging, so he
doesn’t believe that not having alcohol
will affect current or future member-
ships.

Other Pitt fraternities might follow
Phi Delta Theta’s lead.

Ken Greenberg, past president of
Pitt’s Phi Kappa Theta, said, “Frats‘
being alcohol—free is the wave of the
future  but ultimately, you have to be
responsible for your consumption of
alcohol.” He added that the decisio
“breeds a better brother.” 9

Open the door

Secrecy is a problem at this
University. Not only do the various
organizations on campus, such as the
FAS Planning and Budget Committee,
the Board of Trustees, and the Student
Govemment Board, assault us with
decisions made in closed—door meet-
ings, members of the administration
don’t want us, the student body, to be
able to get in contact with them.

_ In a column which ran on
Monday, February 17, we printed
pfk+ @pitt.edu as Dean Peter
Koehler’s e—mail address for you to be
able to write to him and let him know
what you thought about the proposed
FAS cuts. We thought that we were
giving you the correct e—mail address

THE PITT NEWS

  

because that is what he has listed
under his name in the 1996-97
University of Pittsburgh Telephone
Directory.

However, when we checked his
account usage, he hasn’t checked this
account since February 1, 1995. It has
86 unread messages on it as of yester-
day. For all of you who sent Dean
Koehler e—mail or wish to send him e-
mail in the future, his correct e—mail
address is koehler+ @pitt.edu.

This leads us to the problem of
secrecy. Students should have access
to the correct e—mail addresses and

to communication: No more


home phone numbers of all Pitt

, administrators and faculty.

Students have a vested interest in
this University. They spend their
money, their time, and their intellect
making Pitt a great University. IfPitt is
to continue to be a great University or
in some cases becorrre great where it is
lacking, it needs student input

All Dean Koehler has to do is
pick up a telephone directory to ﬁnd
out that his unused e—mail address is
listed. Then, all he has to do is either
check the listed e—mail address or have
the new address posted so that his

7

secrecy at Pitt

messages will get to him.

The problem is that he, like so

many other people in power at this
University, would rather give you the
rtmaround, a bum number, or no num-
ber at all rather than deal with you
directly. -
The result is that the interests of
the students are not a consideration,
and the administration hides its disirr-
terest behind the excuse of “student
apathy.”

We are not apathetic, and we are
not stupid. It’s time for the administra-
tion to open the pathways of commu-
nication to the legitimate gripes and
concerns of students. No more closed
doors and no more secrecy.

Pittsburgh is a small city. In fact,
we shouldn’t even call it a city. It’s
more like a town.

But that’s not bad. In fact, I
think that it’s quite good.

I grew up in Pittsburgh and
have lived here all my life. And
since we have several professional
sports teams, I have always assumed
that Pittsburgh was a big city. Well, I
know now that it’s not Last week, I
was fortunate enough to visit New
York City for a conference on col-
lege newspapers and other media
The most valuable thing that I took
away from" this conference was the
experience of being in New York,
and realizing what it’s really like to
be in a big city.

In short, it’s a great place to
visit, but I wouldn’t want to live
there.

Kevini Lilley, A.gst.iSpons,

It’s so big, and there are so
many people, that you can’t help but
be excited, especially at Times
Square. Between about 40th Street
and 55th Street on Broadway, there
are more people and things to do at
night than in all of downtown
Pittsburgh during the day. Trrnes
Square is so brightly lit from signs
and stores, and heavily populated
with people, that if you don’t look
up at the sky, day is indistinguish-
able from night. Everything there is
big, too. For example, there’s the
Virgin Records Megastore, housing
three full ﬂoors of musicgoods. The
official All—Star Cafe (owned by Joe
Montana, Wayne Gretzky, Shaquille
O’Neal, Andre Agassi, Monica
Seles, and Ken Griffey, Jr.) is the
kind of place that you see in a
movie, complete with swinging
spotlights, hosts with walkie-talkies,

 ~ beautiful waitresses, and good

 

music at a perfectly loud volume.
However, I for one can only
stand to be that excited for a few
days at a time. I oouldn’t live there. I
would have several problems stay-
ing in a big city for a long period of
time. For one, there’s not much of a
chance to take a relaxing walk The
city streets are really busy, and you
have to be on a constant lookout for
cars, especially taxis, which out-
number all other vehicles in the city.
The only option is taking a walk
through one of the parks. There are
so many people at these parks, how-
ever, that you can hardly feel alone.
That’s my big complaint about
New York: it’s almost impossible to
feel alone, and sometimes, I really

want to be alone for a while without .

hiding out in my room. You can do
that in Pittsburgh. In fact, after about
7 p.m. in downtown Pittsburgh, you
can very easily be alone, without
feeling like there’s a band of hood-
lurns waiting around every comer.

Structurally speaking, New
York makes more sense than
Pittsburgh. Streets stretching
through midtown are sensible.
Streets with names run perpendicu-
lar to numbered streets. In addition,
trafﬁc runs in one direction on odd-
numbered streets, and in the oppo-
site direction on even-numbered
streets. Traffic ﬂows nicely, and it’s
easy to keep track of where you are.
New York streets were planned,
unlike Pittsburgh streets, which
more or less just accumulated. I can
only imagine the conversations that
our city engineers must have had
when planning our roads:  this
seems like a good place for a road.
There are no buildings in the way.”
Hence, we are left to ﬁnd our way
with map and compass through the
hodgepodge of alleys that have been
given names.

Bright lights, big city:NYC vs. Pgh

Pittsburgh is small enough that
one can ﬁnd their way through the
alleys. There are not many to
remember. And because there are
even fewer places to go around
Pittsburgh, there are fewer alleys
that one must know.

Things in a smaller city like
Pittsburgh can grow familiar to us. I
went to the top of the Empire State
Building last Friday night and expe-
rienced the magniﬁcent sight. But
there are so many buildings, and
because they were all so close
together, it was diﬁicult to pick out
anything unique. Of course, I identi-
ﬁed some of the major buildings,
and used the pay—per-view binocu-
lars to get a closer look. For the most
part,'it was just a big bunch of lights.

I don’t mean to knock New
York, or Pittsburgh for that matter.
My visit to New York was awe-
some. I can’t remember how many
times I simply looked around,
speechless, trying to ﬁgure out how
to convey to my friends this feeling
of “Wow! I’m here!” Luckily, I did-
n’t have to. My friends would look
at me with that same speechless
expression, and we’d know what
each other was thinking. New York
can do that to you, but this feeling
would disappear if I lived there. It’s
like eating the $30 buffet at a really
good restaurant similar to the
Encore Cafe in the Marriott
Marquis. (Yes, I have actually paid
$30 for Marriott food and loved it!

Unfortunately, they would not ‘

accept blocks.) Dining there once in
awhile is a real treat, but eating there
everyday would become old hat. I’d
rather have it for an occasional treat,
and a delicious one at that.

Just how bad
  will the good
of old Bucs be?

 

Youth will be served on the
Pirates 1997 roster.

It might not be served at a four
star restaurant. But at least it’s better
than the same tired left—overs.

When the regular season begins
in exactly one week, the Pirates will
embark on a new philosophy.

Gone are’ the tired and boring
steadfasts of the Pirates less-than-
stellar teams the last few seasons.
No more overrated, punch-and—judy
hitting Jay Bell. No more slap—hit-
ting and defensive butcher Orlando
Merced. And no more steady and
unspectacular plays from Jeff King.

Replacing those players are. the

household names of Womack,
Guillen, and Randa. A
Who?

Okay, so maybe most people
have never heard of these players.
After all, who would know these
players, unless you list last week’s
Baseball Weekly as the last good
“book” you’ve read.

But the Pirates are hoping that
these players can be the foundation
of future years. General Manager
Kevin McClatchy even went as far
as to say that this year’s team will
have better players at seven of the
nine positions.

Oh, the hope that each spring
brings.

The proposition that the Pirates
have a chance to compete in the
National League is daunting at best
and impossible at worst.

The Pirates have to play in the
same league with people not even
close to the Pirate’s realm of finan-
cial earnings. Two club owners, that

Gymnusis set school record

Pitt finishes fourth in Eastern
Gymnastics League Championships

teve Stonaha

 

Atlantic

The East
Gymnastics League
Championship meet was
Saturday in Raleigh, North
Carolina, and the Pitt
women decided to put
together the second best
performance in Pitt history.

Pitt scored a 192.85
which was good enough for
them to place in the top half
of the standings against
very tough competition. Pitt
finished fourth among the
eight teams competing,
beating North Carolina
(l92.325), Towson State

(192.1), Maryland
(191.775), and Rutgers
(190,050). Pitt couldn’t

overcome the talent of New
Hampshire (193.1), North

 

Carolina State (195.1), or
West Virginia, who won
their second straight
Conference title with a 196.

Pitt set records in two
events as well as tying or
setting two other individual
records. On the vault,
Coach Debbie Yohman sent
out junior Calli Bodnar to
replace Danielle Alba who
had season—ending elbow
surgery before the meet.
Bodnar scored a 9.8 tying
the Pitt record set by Robyn
Senior two years ago.
Bodnar was one of four Pitt
tumblers who scored over
9.7 culminating in a score
of 48.65, which reset the
team vault record that was
set last week versus Ball
State.

Samantha Salyers had
an inspiring performance on

Tuesday, March 25, ‘I997

the uneven bars, destroying
the old record of 9.85,
which was set at the first
meet this season by Janet
Highhill. Salyers scored a
9.925 to capture a tie for
first place on the apparatus.

Highhill scored a 9.725 as-

well, to help Pitt to a 48.325
on the bars.

Despite high scores by
Lori Buck (9.75), Salyers
(9.75), and Kristin Bond
(9.675), the lady panthers
could not conquer the beam
and ﬁnished with a disap-

pointing 46.75.
The ﬂoor exercise has
historically been the

strongest event for the
ladies. They did not disap-
point on Saturday as four
Pitt gymnasts shared sev-
enth place in the meet.
Flamer, Highhill, Senior,
and Lisa Fronhofer all
scored 9.85, and Calli
Bodnar scored a 9.725 to
help Pitt shatter another

school record with a 49.125.
The old record was 48.8, set
last year.

Robyn Senior was the
only Pitt gymnast to com-
pete in the all-around, but
she was not able to crack
the top ten with her score of
37.975.

Last week, three Pitt
gymnasts were named to the
East Atlantic Gymnastics
League, All-Conference
team. Senior Robyn Senior
was selected ﬁrst-team all-
conference in the vault and
the ﬂoor exercise." .

Freshman Danielle
“Freddie” Alba was a unan-
imous first team selection
on the balance beam, and
second team all-conference

Sophomore Janet

with a second team all-con-
ference pick on the uneven
bars. 5

Everything you wanted to know about rugby and more

“Patrick Robertson

Many people may have read the
paper over the past few weeks and
skimmed over the rugby headlines, think-
ing, “I don’t want to read this, I don’t even
know what rugby is.” I know that when I
started my beat on rugby I thought, “I
don’t know what rugby is, either.” This
article should clear up many of the ques-
tions about the sport. .

First of all, the sport of rugby resem-
bles American football. The ﬁeld is quite
similar, and they use a ball much like a
football. However, there are many differ-
ences between the two sports.

The ﬁeld carmot exceed 69 meters in
width. The touch zones where scoring
occurs can be no less than 10 meters long,
and carmot exceed 22 meters in length.
The area in between the touch zones may
not exceed 100 meters. The goal posts are

3 meters high to their crossbar, and then_

more than .4 meters exceeding that on
either upright. They are 5.6 meters wide.

Other than the absence of yard markers
and the different dimensions, the ﬁeld
looks much like a football ﬁeld.

The teams play with 15 players a
side. Play is continual, and they play 40-
minute halves. There are no substitutions
except for injuries. The ball can never be
passed forward or laterally. It can be car-
ried or kicked ahead, but only passed
behind.

The scoring is a little like football.
Tries, worth ﬁve points, are scored when
a player runs into the touch zone and actu-
ally touches the ball on the ground. After
that, the team attempts to kick the ball
through the uprights. The team attempts a
two—point kick 22 meters back from
where the player touches the ball down —

that is, if aplayer touches it down in the
left comer of the touch zone, the ball
comes back 22 meters along the sideline
to be kicked. They also have three-point
conversions. These occur when a player
kicks the ball through the uprights while it
is in play.

A line-out occurs at the begirming of
a game, or after penalties and scores. In
this melee, the two teams line up across
an imaginary line, and the back standing
out of bounds must throw the ball straight
toward the players, who will in turn
attempt to tip the ball back to their team-
mates in order to begin play.

Another way of starting play is called
a scrum. In this case, both teams interlock
in a kind of huddle, when the scrum half

throws the ball in the middle, and the for-
wards struggle to pop the ball loose to
their backs.

If a player is tackled, that player is not
down as in American football. In this
case, the opposing player holds this play-
er down, allowing a ruck to take place.
This is not as organized as a serum, but it
serves the same purpose.

Obviously, the team that scores more
points wins the game, but it is much more
difficult to score than in football, and
there is a lot of strategy involved. By now,
everyone should know enough about
rugby to read the articles or attend a game
or two. Look in tomorrow’s paper to see
how Pitt’s team did last weekend in
Shippensburg.

The women’s rugby team over-
came the loss of three key players to
defeat Clarion 15-0 in a game short-
ened due to fighting.

Pitt’s Angels were leading 15-0
with about two minutes remaining
when the game was called. The skir-
mish occured during the second half
of the game. The two teams had
been warned after the first that
another altercation would result in
the cancellation of the game.

The Angels’ Allison Smith felt
that Clarion’s inability to move the
ball successfully led to the Golden
Eagle’s failure to retain composure,
which ultimately led to the fighting.

Smith opened up the game’s
scoring in the first half with a short
run that put the Angels up 5-0.

“I was supporting Lori
[Altenderfer]. She got tackled and
threw it to me and I took it in, with
a couple of people hanging on,” said
Smith.

The Angels scored again in the
first half when Altenderfer took it in
from 10 meters out. The conversion
failed and the Angels lead 10-0 at
halftime. ’

Jenna Rosenberg scored the
final try for the Angels, but once

‘again the conversion failed.

The team was forced to play
without flankers Idi Okilo and
Allison Moore and hooker Angela
Whaley.

Tuesday, March 25, ‘I997

 

Okilo, a co—captain and one of
the team’s fastest players, sat out
with an ankle injury but is expected
to return for the Angels’ next game,
April 5.

Moore, the team’s other co—cap-
tain, has mono and missed her first
opportunity to play in over a year.
Her return date is unknown.

Whaley, the team’s top hooker,
also missed the game due to illness.

The Angels did not need them,
however, as they dominated field
position and controlled the ball.

“I think that our level of play is
above Clarion’s with or without the
injuries. We showed how strong we
really are,” said Angels President
Althea Rodgers. “We could have
probably crushed them, but we did

everything well for our first game.”

“We played very well,” said
Smith. “We’ve been trying to incor-
porate rucking, we were superb in
that.”

The depth and versatility of the
Angels contributed significantly to
the win.

“The biggest thing that helped
us out is our rookies are really
good,” said Rodgers.

The Angels also won the B-side
game 5-0, with Allison Smith scor-
ing the only try.

The Angels play Fairmont St.
and Rochester April 5 starting at
1:00 p.m. The games will be played
at the Lower Frick Social Club in
Regent Square.

spending possibilities, (Wayne
Huizenga of Florida and Ted Turner
of Atlanta) and a player with a salary
$2 million higher than that of an
entire team (Barry Bonds who will
earn about $10 million this year
compared to the entire Pirate team’s
projected $8 million payroll) are not
fair competition.

Yes, the Pirates will be bad this
year. They will probably be the worst
team in the National League and
maybe even all of baseball.

But before you start crying for
the future of the Pirates, keep in
mind that Baseball America, the
leading publication on minor league
baseball, rated Pittsburgh’s farm sys-
tem as the best in baseball.

The Bucs are loaded with minor

league talent from former No. 1 draft
picks Kris Benson and Chad
Hermanson to sluggers Ron Wright
and Freddy Garcia. All of these play-
ers are a year or two away from the
majors but are slated to be impact
players in the years to come.

So don’t expect a lot out of this
year’s Pirates team. What you can
expect is competition for starting
jobs and a reprise from the same
tired, left-over players that have
been hanging around the Pirates the
last few seasons.

This year’s youth movement will
pay off in wins during the next few
seasons.

”At a time when children
suffer from perhaps the
gravest social problems
of any group in the U.S.,
how do we ensure that
they grow up in the best
environment possible?”

(TIME Magazine February 3, 1997)

YOU can be part of the growing movement to prepare to
meet the needs of tomorrow’s children by enrolling in Pitt’s
Program in Child Development and Child Care. Through a
combination of hands-on practice in a variety of internship
sites, and classwork, you will learn how to use
developmental relationships, counseling skills, activity
programming and program design to promote positive child
and youth development.

For further information and application packets for both the
upper division B.S. program and M.S. program, call
624-2909, send e-mail to narr+@pitt.edu, or call in person
at 1717 Cathedral of Learning.
