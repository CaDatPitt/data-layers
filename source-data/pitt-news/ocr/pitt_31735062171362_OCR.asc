Seven Study Guerillas

by STEVE LUBETSKY

The meaning of the term "guerilla," according
to Susan Walsh, has long been subject to controver-
sy. Miss Walsh, instructor of CAS 17: Guerilla War-
fare in Latin America, hopes that the course will
resolve much of the ambiguity.

Implemented this fall by the College of Arts and
Sciences, CAS 17 will examine the various defini-
tions of “guerilla“ and the different methods pecu-
liar to guerilla movements. The course traces the
“origins, development, and impact of the guerilla
movements in Latin America." investigating such
factors as socio-economic conditions, international
relations, national politics, and Latin American
history.

The program of study for CAS 17 was designed
by Miss Walsh, a senior soci0logy—po'litical science
major. who became interested in Latin American
studies while serving in Mexico as a VISTA volun-
teer. She believes that the progress of CAS 17 dem-
onstrates that "students can design their own
courses and be successful."

Dr. James Malloy, a Political Science professor,
serves as the faculty advisor to the course. He des-
cribed CAS 17 as “a one-shot deal,” since it is plan-
ned primarily by students. “Only the concept re-
mains the saipe, never the format,” said Malloy,

whose extensive research on guerilla movements
was buttressed by several hair-raising summers in
the midst of Latin American insurgencies.

Potential registrants for the course were re-
cruited by the Center for International Studies. The
Center sent letters regarding the course to those
students having a background in Spanish or Latin
American studies.

The course, however, is open to anyone interest-
ed, and there are no prerequisites. Evaluation is
based upon class discussion and a paper.

Miss Walsh expressed disappointment that the
course has attracted only seven students, but she
hopes that the number will increase to 10 or 12 for
the winter term. She attributes the light response to
the belated approval of the course and the lack of
publicity for it.

The relatively small enrollment has not hinder-
ed the efforts of the seven. One related that the
course “broadens my understanding of Latin Amer-
ica and why the United States takes interest in it."
She hopes to discover “why the U.S. considers guer-
illa movements a threat to the point that it resorts
to counter insurgency.”

According to another student, the outlook for
CAS 17 is positive. “The course is still in its plan-
ning stage,” he remarked, “and there will be fu-
ture courses deriving from this.”

 

mous vote, there are still some who believe it contains flaws
4. The elected students. togeth- Which Ought to be C0”'eCt€d-

One of these is Carl Van Horn, a junior Political Science major,
who served on last year’s restructuring committee.

While Van Horn basically agrees with the constitution, he feels it
is deficient in several respects.

NEED FOR RATIFICATION

Principally, Van Horn is disturbed that the new constitution lacks
a provision stipulating that it be ratified by the University Senate and
the Board of Trustees. He believes that a constitution ratified by stu-
dents alone will be meaningful to students alone, and not to adminis-
trators and faculty members.

One other problem Van Horn finds in the new constitution is its fail-
ure to hold the SG Allocations Committee responsible for its decisions.
Since the Allocations Committee handles around $200,000, Van Horn 
believes the constitution should be amended to include a method of

Van Horn also points out that the constitution makes no mention of

having the four commissioners (of academic affairs, social affairs,

. programming, and committees, respectively) meet together. He be-

lieves this is vital if consistent policies are to be formulated by SG.
Without this added mechanism. he contends, actions will be too diffuse.

Despite this criticisms, Van Horn generally supports the consti-

tution. “The present ideas of the
new constitution are valid, but
there are many flaws which need
to be corrected. I urge a careful
re-examination.”

Suzanne Slyman, a junior who
has beeen in SC for three years
and who also served on last year’s
restructuring committee, thinks
the constitution is alright as it
stands. “Many individuals pre-
sently seem to be frightened of its

-flexibility,” Slyman notes, “but -
this is the main strength of the ,

constitution. In the past, senators
seemed more concerned with
dealing with laws and amend-
ments and not concrete situations
and accomplishments. This con-
stitution won’t hold people in. In
the past five years, this is the
third constitution to come up. I
think that this constitution will
end this, and meet the changing
times and the new population
which comes to the University ev-
ery four years.”

FOUR COMMISSIONERS

Slyman believes that the most
important aspect of the new con-
stitution is the addition of four
elected representatives to the
University Senate Council. These
four students, once elected, will

be commissioners with duties in 
the four specific areas mentioned ,

earlier.

The new setup, she contends,
will result not only in more stu-
dent involvement but also in more
accomplishments, because there
will be four persons instead of
just one to handle all these areas.

Also, Slyman argues, a person
elected to one of the areas will
probably have more legitimacy in
the eyes of students and adminis-
trators. The reasoning behind the
contention is that a student will be
able to specialize in the division in
which he is most interested and
capable.

The new constitution is the pro- , 

duct of several terms of work and
a variety of student and faculty
inputs. .

"A Licr-rise To Kill”

 

General Lauds System

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Associate Editor

His biography reads like an
honor score: Deputy Assistant
Secretary of Defense. Florida
Jaycees Man of the Year, 1969:
holder of the Legion of Merit. the
Distinguished Flying Cross. the
Distinguished Unit and Presiden-
tial Citations. etc.

Yet General Daniel “Chappie"
James. Jr. of the United States
Air Force, is a man in the middle.
As a black and a representative
of the US government, he is daily
confronted with charges of “Un-
cle Tomism.“ according to his

own admission. and forced to de-

fend himself.

“I don't feel any conflict about
being black and being in the mili-
tary service." he claimed. “When
somebody calls me an Uncle Tom.
I just look at the source. Some-
body once said to me when I first
went into the Air Force that the
same people who attacked me on
the way up would still be there on
the street corners with their cups
when I made it."

AFIRST
Nevertheless. as one of the first
of his race to attain a generals
status. James relates to the plight
of the poor black in America.

“I understand the problems of
the black people in this country. I
understand how the Panthers’ feel
about always being trod on. I un-

derstand how it might seem better '

to die than to remain how they
are.“ he said. "I understand
where they are coming from. but
I don't agree with where they are
going." ,

His solution lies in changing our
present institutions from within
and “especially peoples’ atti-
tudes.”

“I disagree with the Panthers
for the same reason that 1 dis-
agree with the Klan, both are ra-
cist groups. You must change the
attitudes of people while you
change the institutions in which
they operate."

James is convinced that "all
people all over the world believe
in equality." He admitted. how-
ever. that “some people are more
unequal than others."

Although he addressed himself
to the unequal conditions of the
Mellons and poor blacks and
whites atthe same time. he was
quick to state his political position.

"I'm not underwriting social-
ism. make sure that you get that
clearly." James said. “I'm a cap-
italist. no doubt about it.

HE’SA ‘MAN’
General James. 50 years old.

-statuesquely tall and personally

dominating. was decisive about
his role as “a man in this society
and a soldier of the government."

He told Paul Boas, law student
here. at a Friday luncheon. that
“a man fights for his country and
is willing to die.

“You are a coward,” he accus-
ed Boas heatedly. “You are afraid
to defend you country, you and the
other radicals in this nation.”

' His business. as a "representa-
tive of the MIC, is killing.“

“I have a license to kill from
this government." he responded.
to a question concerning his
"right to kill yellow people."

"We are there to fight yellow
people now." he explained. "But
this country has fought white peo-
ple. too. in Germany and Italy. We
are there (in Vietnam) because of
our foreign policies—and some
economic motives—and to protect
what is ours."

As a black man. James contin-
ued. “I have the same interests as
any other American—to protect
the country. When people burn and
destroy. they are burning and de-
stroying my country. too.“

Pitt News Drama Critic

 

   

The Studio Theatre. so far this season. has been engaged in
bringing back the best of last season. This. in fact. has turned out to
be a very profitable idea—at least as far as audiences have been con-
cerned.

Last eve. however. there was an exception. Aside from The Pro-
blem revived last spring. Sandy Berman presented the premier of
her Odyssey in Mime.

Unless I was deceived by all of the laughter and applause. those
attending seemed to be thoroughly pleased with her display of talent.
both as a writer and a performer.

Mime. is a highly demanding art requiring not only precision.
but a good deal of creativity and expressive skill. A repertoire of
experience for the aspiring mimest is not only hard to come by. but
difficult. as far as finding one who can teach and translate this me-
dium of expression. Therefore. it would be somewhat unfair to judge
Miss Berman more than lightly in this area of theatre. which is al-
most a lost art.

Each of Miss Berman‘s mime‘s were more in line with charac-
terizations than “total mime." In most instances. there was little done
to create for us anything more than facial expression plus some body
movement. Aside from created props ltypewriter. bar, etc., which
in most instances were direct motivation) the atmosphere or per-
haps physical properties of her immediate environment were lost or
missing.

In The Wall, however. Miss Berman turned in a rather inter-
esting performance. closer to what I would call "Mime" in a clini-
cal sense. There was a person and a place. and an atmosphere that
was quite believable—quite real -— quite well done.

WPGH—campus radio station, applying for FM license and under attack.

by JOHN DEMCHAK

 Thrashingabout the University
of Pittsburgh, for the first time
as a student. I could not help but
be impressed with the size and

' , complexity of what is here.

On any large university cam-
pus, the surest and most reliable

:- method for getting news is

through the student media—the
newspaper, the campus radio.

’_and thebulletin boards. for ex-

ample.

A survey taken at the Joy-
Weinglass debate two weeks ago

revealed that while a small
group of students had been alert-
ed to the event by The Pitt News
and the bulletin boards. seem-
ingly no one present had receiv-
ed the word through the campus
radio station.

Be that as it may. this amaz-
ing display of non—motivation on
the part of the campus radio
voice prompted me to launch an
investigation into this particular
branch of the University com-
munications system.

Subjectively. I would have to
say that WPGH—820 is adequate

Angel Flight will hold its fall term Rush Open House this evening,

from 6:00 8:00 P.M. in room 435 S. U.

-just barely—-as a dormitory-
centered radio station. It has
music—~usually somewhat out-
dated. but music nonetheless-
and some semblance of campus
news. plus the American Infor-
mation Network on-the-hour na-
tional and international reports.

But WPGH is nothing to write
home to mother about.

Hearing the same music on
WPGH as one hears on a WIXZ
or KQV locally. plus some cam-
pus news «here and there» is not
overly stimulating or excitingly
different. or even surprisingly
imaginative. /,

COMMUTERS

Now. according to what I
hear. the Commuter Association
feels that there should be some
sort of radio'link between the
lniversity and the residences of
the individual commuters.

There is a way of doing this by
applying for and operating a
campus—based FM radio service.
much as Duquesne University
does locally with WDUQ-FM.

WPGH has asked. or will ask
shortly. for support in going for
an FM license from the Com-
muter Association.

The station wants to go city-
wide with an FM signal to add to
its closed—circuit 820 AM. and
it needs all the support it can get
from campus organizations.

The time has come to specu-
late briefly on the merit of this

organization. holding sway over "

a city-wide FM station emanat-
ing from the University.

There are two types of radio
services extant currently.

The “music station.“ which
WPGH has tried to become. of-
fers two rather indistinct types
of programming. music and
news. followed by news and mu-
sic.

It is a station geared to at-
tract the maximum number of
advertisers and listeners while.
at the same time.’ reducing the
program content to the absolute
minimum. This sets uplan oper-
ational procedure which can be
followed with ease by a trained
ape.

COMMERCIALSIM

This type of programming has
been developed and used with a
great deal of success by com-
mercial radio stations. most of
which have but one goal in mind:
that of making money. without
spending too much of it in the
process.

The other type of radio serv-
ice. this one usually operated by
colleges and universities. con-
centrates primarily on program-
ming to college-level people who
have developed interest in many
varied topics.

Utilizing the free services of
essentially philanthropic organ-
izations such as the National Ed-
ucational Radio network, the In-
ter-Collegiate Broadcasting
Service, and the Broadcasting
Foundation of America, as well
as local resources. these sta-
tions tend to offer a rather wide
variety of programs to the pub-

   
   
   
 
  
 
  
  
  
 
 
   
  
  
 
  
  
 
    
  
  
  
  
   
    
   

Among these are feature mu-
sic. news. public affairs. discus-
sions of minor importance. in-
terviews of great importance.
and public service programs.

Since the college station does
not have to be governed by the
mass mind at its most prima-
tive. there is much room for the
two things which will. hopefully.
bring some life back to instant-
juke-box radio; namely confron-
tation and experimentation.

Since this latter type of sta-
tion seems to flourish best in a

collegiate environment and ’

since the University has a col-
legiate environment. it might
be wise to consider going the

rout of this second type of broad- .

cast service. ~

WPGH could easily supply the
facilities for these services. and
an experimental radio unit could
be designed to control the pro-
gramming. or.perhaps a separ-
ate system that could just as
easily be established for the FM

facility.

Both of.these directions would
provide creative alternatives for
the myriad of people on campus
who might wish to participate in
radio broadcasting in a capacity
other than that of a glorified but-
ton pusher.

At any rate. should WPGH‘s
current programming be fed
city-wide over the FM. there can
be little doubt that the Universi-
ty would soon feel the pinch of its
FM station turned into a laugh-

(Editor's Note( An apparently accidental disruption followed by an
exchange of remarks which occurred in the Political Science class of Dr.
Steven Rosen on Thursday, Sept. 24, has touched off a minor contro-
versy on the news and editorial pages of The Pitt News. In order to
reach an amenable solution to the incident which involved the filing of
charges by Rosen against Dr. Stanley Shostak, The Pitt News will no
longer provide coverage of the event unless there is an additional hap-
pening. However, the editors of The Pitt News strongly urge that the
two professors, Rosen and Shostak, follow our example and refrain
from recommending that their respective classes write letters, sign
statements and otherwise keep the-matter burning.)

To the Editor. The Pitt News:

We would like to express to the campus community our regret
that a relatively small incident has become a cause celebre.

~* The interval between classes has always required that the co-
operation of the students and faculty. When large numbers of stu-
dents are involved. indeed even more cooperation is required.

Dr. Shostak has taken steps to avoid problems in the future by
starting his classes 10 minutes after the hour and byrequesting that
his students do not appear before that hour.

_ We both regret intemperate remarks on this issue and the on-
flated public exposure that the incident has received.

 Changed I mage ;

 ' (Editor's Note: The author is the President of Zeta
Beta Tau fraternity and secretary of the Interlrater-'1

/lnity Council (lFC) under the leadership of President

Joe Wendler.)
by SID WERNER

The Fraternity System has an outstanding pro-
duct to sell to the University. but seemingly mis-
led public to buy it.

The fraternities on campus have undergone
such great changes in the past three years. that a
senior who rushed fraternities in 1967 but decided
not to join. might go backto those same fraternity
houses today. and find an entirely different en-
vironment.

The major changes have come in
the area of pledge programming-—
that part-of fraternities which is
most condemned.

Practically everyone has seen a
movie in which a fraternity man
initiates a pledge by having him jump. blindfolded.
into a lake full of large rocks.

The story usually ends with the pledge serious-
ly injured or dead. and the fraternity men cogni-
zant that their folly was dangerous and unneces-
sary.

_ NONE HERE

Although University fraternities have never
had comparable incidents. they have come to real-
ize the evils of physical hazing. And so. beginning
September. 1968. fraternities began phasing out
hazing.

Initiates are no longer paddled or in other ways
degraded. They are taken into their respective
fraternities on the basis of friendship.

By 1969 most fraternities had made great pro-
gress in eliminating their hazing tactics and had
proceeded to further liberalize their pledge pro-
grams.

The pledge period is now the time for the new
men to make certain that the fraternity he has
chosen is the right one for him and then to assimi-
late into the organization.

ASSIMILATING

It is with this idea of assimilation in mind that
a number of progressive programs have been es-
tablished. The Neophyte Policy of Zeta Beta Tau

I has put the new members on an equal basis with

the older Brotherhood. except for the right to vote.
Pi Kappa Alpha's’Associate Member Policy also
elevated the new man to a higher status.

In the near future the institution of pledging
may be discarded completely and operations are

‘ Z’/to Old grotor/oity Js Dodd ’

 

 
  

now underiway in the Interfratfernity Council. to try I

 

ing stock.

to cut the time limit placed on the pledge period 

the University.

At the present time. a man must attain a satis-
factory QPA before he is permitted to join a fra-
ternity. Scholarship. however. has practically‘ be-
come the by—word in some fraternities.

Eleven of the Universities I6 fraternities were
above the men‘s average. with the highest one
maintaining a 3.15 average.

And what of the fraternity systems once dis-
criminatory policies‘? Every national fraternity
on this campus has eliminated any discriminatory
clause from their constitutions.

NON-ETHNIC

The so-called Catholic or Jewish houses no

longer maintain ethnic entrance requirements.

A few years ago the Black fraternities on cam-
pus broke away from the IFC. leaving the rest of
the Greek system with a lilly white complexion.
but a few fraternities are making progress in
breaking down this barrier.

It is vital for fraternities to stay abreast of
current campus thought. Otherwise the system
will suffer. the victim of hard line traditionalism.
The Interfraternity Council knows this. and the in-
dividual fraternities recognize it. so it is very
probable that the long needed reform will continue.

Think Again
On “Outrage”

Editor. The Pitt News:
I wish to take issue with the let-

ter by George Hughes in the Sept. ‘

30 edition of The Pitt News con-
cerning Marxism and faculty. Mr.
Hughes opens by characterizing
the University decision to grant
one day for student campaign ac-

" ttivity as an "outrage.“

Such a statement makesit pain-
fully obvious that the oft-heard
complaint that students do not
give working within the system a
chance is sheer hipocrisy.

This is followed by the charge
that “colleges are . . . centers for
Marxist indoctrination.“ The
sparse attendance at many of the
leftist-oriented rallies. such as
the May Day Rally of last year «if
a collection of no more than 30
people can be called a rally). in-
dicates the falsity of this charge.

Hughes goes on to attack the
history faculty (one must assume
that he refers to that of the Uni-

, versity since he does not specify»

from an explicit Marxist frame-
work.“

As a history major who has tak-
en or audited 36 history credits at
the Cniversity. I find this view-
point totally inaccurate. The
majority of the history faculty
have not appeared to me to be
Marxist and of the minority who
are. few let it bias their teaching.

What is done by most of the his-
tory faculty is to present the
Marxist view of history together
with more orthodox interpreta-
tions.

Without an exposure to these
various viewpoints. a balanced
view of history is not possible.
Hughes maintains that "real“ his-

tory is not taught at Pitt. I would
like to know just what Mr. Hughes
thinks "real" history is.

If Mr. Hughes thinks that there
is an ultimate historical truth
which can be found. I would like
to wish him luck in achieving this
goal which has escaped historians
since Herodotus.

 

How Mr. Hughes would achieve
this picture of “real" history if
he wishes to exclude those the-
ories of history which prove dis-
tasteful to him I really could not
imagine.

 A Keep Panthers. Ailing

a

by JERRY MYERS

The scene in the Panther locker room after Saturdays 27-6 tri-
umph over a determined Kent State squad hardly resembled a post-

game victory celebration.

Instead the Cats were concentrating on licking their wounds. In.

the training room a corridor away from the main dressing area. there
was ‘standing room only." for those who could manage to stand.
Lifting himself up on a pair of crutches and testing them out

for size was big defensive end Jack Dykes. Since Saturday. X—rays
have been taken of Dykes‘ right knee indicating that there is no

bone damage. but the extent of

his injury will not be known for
several days. He is definitely out
for the Navy game.

Lying flat on his back on -one
of the tables was Charlie Hall,
obviously in great pain. Hall suf-
fered severe knee bruises against
Kent State, but he will be rea-
dy for the Navy game.

Dave Havern, already dressed
and departed. hobbled home with
a bruised lower ‘back and is a
hopeful starter against Navy.

And the list goes on and on.
Hank Alford. Pitt's other starting
defensive end. who was injured
in the Baylor game. is expected
to .be out at least one more week.
Johfi. Simpson. starting offensive
guard. who pulled a hamstring

. muscle in practice last week will A

be ready for Navy this Saturday.

If starting quarterback John
Hogan responds to treatment of
his sprained ankle he'll be ready
for'the Middies and Ralph Cin-
drich, the Panthers big middle
linebacker, should see limited
action at Annapolis.

Coach Carl DePasqua appears

‘ to be at his wit’s end.

“We’re riddled with injuries,
and this certainly has affected
our overall performancefg’ De-
Pasqua said. “We aren’t deep
enough to overcome so many in-
juries to our key personnel.”

With two quarterbacks as ten-
tative starters, back—up signal-
caller Tom Hasbach has to be
ready for action. Hasbach. a 6-1.
180-pound sophomore from Pitts-
burgh piloted the Panthers through
35 minutes of grueling football
against the Golden Flashes last
week—end. He now has that es-
sential game experience that
is so important and with the sit-
uation as it is. he might get a
chance to accumulate some more.

"The quarterback situation is
drastic." DePasqua went on to
say. “All .we can do is hope that
they respond to treatment.“

On a brighter note. the Panth-
ers have an opportunity to put
together their first three-game
«winning streak since 1963. The
Navy game might be more im-
portant than it looks. if only as
a rejuvinator.

Fans "Get On’
Carl DePasqua

 

 

 

by ED CONLEY
Sports Editor

Carl DePasqua received "a couple" letters from Panther fans this
week. and he didn‘t appreciate their content.

At yesterdays football luncheon the Pitt football coach admitted
that his mail has included complaints about his choice for first string
positions in the offensive backfield. particularly at the fullback post
where Tony Esposito plays ahead of Phil Sgrignoli.

A similar gripe was voiced in the Pitt News sports office Saturday

after Sgrignoli replaced Esposit.o
and literally ran through Kent
States defense with his powerful
rushing ability.

“Why don’t you start getting on
that guy (DePasqua) about Sgrig-
noli. He’s a lot ' 
‘better than Es-
posito,” is about 
the way the vis- L
itor registered ti":
his. thoughts. I 6
might add that
the same plea
was expounded *
upon by another 
irate fan on ' --
Monday night. PHIL SGRIGNOLI

But "getting on“ DePasqua
wasn‘t necessary. The fans who
want to be heard write directly to
the man who counts. and Carl De-
Pasqua read the opinion that I
heard.

   
   

"We have a well-rounded of-
fense.“ DePasqua refuted. men-
tioning that the two fullbacks and
tailback Denny Ferris all run ex-
ceptionally well.

“We’re happy to have Phil
Sgrignoli on the team. He’s a hell-
uva football player, but Esposito
gained about 78 yards on Satur-
day.” L

Esposito gained exactly 78
yards against Kent State and
Sgrignoli charged for 71 yards
on six fewer carries. But the
coach added that Esposito was
tops on a coach‘s grading scale

which accounts for all aspects of
the game.

Those who complain about the
fullback dilemma—if you can call
choosing between two productive
men a dilemna—‘point to statis-
tics when they make their stabs
at the coach.

Esposito has averaged a solid
4.1 yards per rush this fall, but
his substitute has advanced 5.5
yards for an average burst. Sure‘,
an average usually drops with an
increased amount of runs, they
say, but the more Sgrignoli ar-
ries the better he looks, which is
true as he is grinding out more
yardage than last year when he
averaged 4.9 per run.

“Many times when the second-(3
unit comes in we expect them to
do a good job." DePasqua argues.
however. “Those two kids in front
«starters Esposito and Ferris) do
a great job of softening people
up...

Tony Esposito is DePasqua‘s
starting fullback. Complaints are-
n‘t going to alter that. and it isn‘t
a knock against Sgrignoli. The
Panther coach is obviously im-
pressed with his number two man.
as he uses him more often. “

Sgrignoli has carried the ball
22 times in three games. steadi-
ly approaching his total of 34 rush-
es last season. And that‘s despite
the Panther opening game where
the plan was to throw the pass.

-Vornhagen

Worlcs For
His Points

by MARTY HELLMAN

For senior Mark Vornhagen.
excellence in cross country and
track has not come easily.

“I don‘t have the natural ability
as a runner like some guys do."
Mark said. “I'm the type of run-
ner who has to work to do well.“

Since Mark started competing
as a sophomore in high school at
Bernardsville. N. J.. he has been
outstanding both as a harrier and
as a two-miler.

In his junior and senior years,
Vornhagen led his squad to two
consecutive state cross country
titles for small schools.

For the past four seasons. he
has continued in his winning ways
as a member of the Pitt cross
country team. ’

During his freshman year.
Vornhagen was one of the key rea-
sons that the Pitt Frosh placed
second in the IC4A's. As a mem-

_ ber of the varsity squad he has
 consistently been one of the top
three runners.

“My best race ever in cross
country was at last year’s East-
ern Championships when I placed‘
39th.”

Mark views the present season
with much anticipation and excite-
ment.

"This is definitely the best
team that I have ever been a part
of. With all the talent that~we‘ve
got. we all know that the next guy
will take yourplace if you let up.“

Because of the abbreviated
schedule this fall and the empha-
sis on the final meets, Mark finds
it easier and more enyoyable to
train.

"We have less pressure on us.
and we all really like it. Most of
the early work was left for us to
do individually with the stipula-
tion that we run 100 miles per

 week.

Track. not cross country. was
the main reason that Mark came
to Pitt. Coach Jim Banner recruit-
ed him at the New Jersey track
championships.

“I came in second in the state
in my junior year for the two mile
run, and first when I was a sen-
ior.”

Marks best result in the two
mile was a 9:09 second place fin-
ish in the Delaware Invitational
as a soph.

The annual Penn Relays in
Vornhagen‘s favorite meet. “It‘s
such a great atmosphere here

) when there are 40,000 people

screaming and going crazy over
track.“

Vieing against the top two mil-
ers in the east, Mark copped 15th
as a sophomore and as a junior
last year placed 12th.

Future plans for Vornhagen are
hazy at present.

"I might go to grad school in
Michigan for economics. 1 do
know that I will continue to run.
not for competition. but just for
my own health."
