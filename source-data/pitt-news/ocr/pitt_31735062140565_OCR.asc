The ‘ University Defense
council, preparing today for
any emergency, issued the fol-
lowing instructions for stu-
dents and faculty members in case
of air-raid. . ’ '

The instructions, signed by John
Weber, secretary of the University

Following is 11. brief summary
of instructions issued by Univer-
sity authorities for use in case
of onlair-raids
1. Avoid all floors below the sixth,

including the Commons room.
2. Avoid the 7th, 10th, 14th, and
23rd floors. These are not

suitable because of their proxa H

imity to roof areas.
3. Assemble on any other floor be-
tween the 6th and 28th.

4. Avoid the wings of the build- H‘

ing within three floors of a

, roof area.

5. Keep away from windows or
other possible sources of fly-
ing glass. .

6. Do not crowd; do notrush; use
stairs instead of elevators.

and Theodore W. Biddle, acting
dean of men and assistant coordi-
nator of defense, will be posted in
prominent spots all over the Uni-
versity.

The instructions follow‘:

UNIVERSITY DEFENSE BULLETIN
No. I.

Some students have inquired re-
garding their safety at the Univer-
sity in event of an air attack in
the vicinity of the Cathedral of
Learning. This statement is pre-
pared, not because of any particu-
lar danger in the Cathedral of
Learning, but rather to give occu-
pants an idea of what‘ to do if the
Cathedral is included in an attack
area.

It is the experience in Europe
that more casualties result from
ﬂying glass and debris than from
any other cause. The Cathedral of

M Learning, because of the large open

space around it, is peculiarly safe
from this hazard. Its construction
of steel and concrete and its rela-
tively small roof areas, made of

"reinforced concrete are added ad-
ivantagefor safety. This construc-

tionpalso provides safety from fires
caused by incendiary bombs.

Some students have considered
the Commons»room~ the safest place
in the Cathedral. While most parts
of ‘ the Cathedral are considered

safe, the,Commons room, because

of the large exposure of roof area '

immediately above, is probably the
least safe of the larger rooms in

of the University is to assembleom

- Carl Olson while preparing anoth-
er Blue and Gold indoor cinder rep-

world.
However, he stated deﬁnitely
that physically ﬁt men were re-
quired by the military forces of

the Unital States and that is what-

the indoor track training is doing
for the Pitt men. Track is one of
D the chief ways of getting a. man
into shape and he promises to do
just that for any man that comes

out for the sport. “He went‘ on to‘

say that the theme of every coacll

v in the country is “physical ﬁtn-essz”

about the war Situation, he is at

, Associated Press placed Ralph
Fife, burly Panther guard, on their

First Team All—American squad.-
“This adds another link in Fife’s
'.already long chain of all-American"

honors. The ‘AP team, ‘picked by
sports writers, coaches and officials
rewarded -Fife for his outstanding
play throughout the past season
by pairing him with Endicott Pea-
body at the guard positions on‘ its
select eleven.

Dillon Graham, editorof the An-

nual team, says, “It was Fife who

was largely responsible for Pitts-S
burgh’s upset of Fordham in the‘

Rams’ only defeat.”~ “Fife ruined

our whole attack,” says Jim Crow-.

ley, Fordham mentor, “We couldn’t
fake him out of position.” V

“‘Althoug‘h playing with a medi-‘
performance’

ocre, club, Fife’s
couldn’t be overlooked. He played
a full 60 minutes against Duke and.
Ohio State and his’ play against
Minnesota rated him among the
all‘,-time greats,” concluded Wal-
lace Wade, Duke coach.

., Phi Kappa continued their vic-
tory parade in the Greek league

when they nosed out an impressive-

Phi Gain quintet last Thursday

,31-29. ‘The win was the second in

as many games for the Phi Kappa

ﬁveanjd placed them at the top of-._
the IM league. The contest was

the best played thus ‘far in the
newly inaugurated hoop campaign.
Led by Bob Tyberski and Tom
Ki-am, the Phi Kaps ﬁnally emerged
victorious from a contest that saw
the lead exchange hand many
times. Tyberski was‘ high man for
the NevillepSt.»aggregation, tally-
ing eleven points. Tom Kram also
helped ‘the cause along by_drop-
ping in four baskets for eight
points.

- composed ‘of ‘former college aces
including Joe ~“Peppyl’ Garcia,
Pitt star‘ of a few years ago, Bill
Fortney of Duquesne" aifame and
Steve Sitko, Notre Dame‘ luniinary.

The Panthers pulled a surprised

of their own when they handed the
s_tar—studded aggregation a 30-27

lacing. Army bound Eddie Ziolkow- ‘

ski led the assault for the Blue and
Gold as he registered 18 points.

“Ziol” sunk eight field goals -and‘

two foul shots. - T

The victory "was more than
pleasing to the. Carlson-men be-
cause the court they played on had
the new fan shaped banking
boards, and it was the first ‘time
they had played on such a court.
The Panthers trailed at the end of
the first period 10-2, but after they
had become used to the new bank-
ing board they overtook the Fleet
Wings and ﬁnally won out.

The tapering -off process begins
tonight as the ‘boys get set to open

one of the most optimistic seasons
in Pitt history. Theplayers have

caught some of Carlson’s enthusi-
astic fever and have set the Sugar
Bowl game in New Orleans, to be
played the latter part of March, as
their goal. If they can keep up the
pace they have maintaiiied through-

After being crushed by the Phi

ln Flo rlda
‘Dr. Frank Conrad, father o'f
American broadcasting, who died
in Miami, Florida, last week, was
honored by the University‘with an
honorary doctor of science degree
in 1928. .
First to foresee the tremendous
possibilities of wireless telephony,
Dr. Conrad’s research in 1920 led’
to the broadcast of regular pro-
grams and later‘ to the establish-
ment of, the pioneer broadcasting
station, of the - world, Westing-
house’s KDKA. -
Born in Pittsburgh on May 4,
.1874, Dr. Conrad joined the West-

inghouse company in 1890 and ad- A

vanced rapidly from the bench to

research. His first important con- »

tribution was the round type elec-
tric meter now_ in universal use.
Other inventions were the panta-
graph power -conductor used on

/electric trains, an improved arc
lamp, the electric clock, AC cir-
cuit breakers, automobile starting,
lighting and ignition systems, and
many other devices.

In 1926 he received the Morris
Liebman award from the Institute
of Radio Engineers. In 1931 he was
awarded the Edison medal of the”
American Institute of Electrical
Engineers, in 1933 the John Scott
medal of Philadelphia, and in 1936
