Newsweek correspondent Ar-
mand de Borchgrave, who con-
siders himself “a layman with
common sense and not an ex-
pert,” believes that man is
burdened by a homespun philo-

S ~ sophy — a basic theory which re-

mains primitive despite greater
change in today’s world than ever
before.

He said man doesn’t have the
ability to break through the clich-
es he has lived with since the Sec-
ond World War. And he says, “The

world is jammed packed with din-

osaur-like figures, institutions out-
wardly active——but inward1v_dead.”

 World Filled With ‘International Illusions’

IT WAS A small spring session
audience in the Supper Room
Thursday. But they listened to
Borchgrave support his closing
question — Why can’t we muster
the imagination required to re-
group as nation states? — with
more than enough examples. '

.He said we are faced with in-
ternational illusions—specifically
Vietnam and the Middle East.

“We are faced with protracted
conflicts,” said Borchgrave. “In
Vietnam, North Vietnam knows it
cannot lose. Ho Chi Minh, who is
now 79 years old, believes he is
about to duplicate the same feat
against the US as he did against
the French. ’.’

Borchgrave contends that Egyp-
tian’ attacks result because Nas-
ser must think about thermorale
of his army—his sole basis of pow-
er. "His army (in attacking Is-
raeli areas) must seem to be do-
ing something.“

ON THE OTHER hand. Borch-
grave says Israel is playing down
the war. "Their only fault." he
claims. "was their failure to make
a decision after the six-day war.
They could have bargained with
Hussein or Nasser then."

Borchgrave. who has been a
correspondent in Moscow. has
many Soviet contacts. He added
comments surrounding ‘both the
arms‘ race and the Sino-Soviet
ideology clash.

—“EACH STEP in the arms race
has been a result of what the other
side has been doing. From my So-
viet contacts. I have found that
Russia would like to see us spend
more on. defense (that is, the
ABMs) than on offense (the
ICBMs).“ -

‘News’ Tops Pi Delt Winners

It’s no wonder.

With Pi Delta Epsilon, the
University’s honorary journa-
lism society, urging adminis-
trators to look into the possi-
bilities of restarting a School
of Communications here, five
members of The Pitt News staff
captured six of Pi Delt‘s national
editorial and news honors —— more
than any other college newspaper.

Paul Stoller, the graduating edi-
tor of The Pitt News, led the way.

Ironically, the Pi Delt chapter

here at the University stands as_

the only chapter not supported by a
Communications - Journalism

School. "The society, one of 143

chapters, has been trying to change
that.

Through the efforts of a Pi Delt
- committee, the Director of Publi-
cations, Mrs. Esther Kitzes, and
Herbert Stein, special assistant to
the Chancellor, a tentative propos;
al has been presented to the ad-
ministration to “provide students
with an interdisciplinary, interde-
partmental program in communi-
cations.”

The proposal states thata “pro-
gram for communications could
have as its broad focus on the un-
dergraduate level communications
through the mass media. A sharp-
er focus might be the reporting of
news and information in urban af-

fairs.”

The two-yea1’—old journalism
course (English 145), the first ini-
tiated here in a long time, has
been hampered by a lack of credi-
bility. Albert Bloom, the class in-
structor and also the executive
editor of the Jewish Chronicle,
has said that the class is muchtoo
large. ’

“It covers a broad spectrum,”
says Bloom, “from someone who
has had journalistic training to
someone who has not. But it’s the
only one of its kind.”

For the first time, a text (Inter-
pretive Reporting) has been" re-
quired for the course.

Bloom has said that what must
be started is a basic “news and
editorial sequence, encompassing
public relations and TV and ra-
dio."

Media's Message: More Racism;
Unconscious Oppression Of Blacl<s

Reprinted from the Kent Stater

by LAFAYETTE TOLLIVER

One of the most blatant forms of
outright racism can be seen in
the mass media, that being the
television, radio, newspaper,
magazines and in just the white
society reinforcing their racial ha-
treds by conscious or unconscious
oppression of the black people.

Before one can truly under-
stand how such a cruel thing as
taking away a person’s identity
came about, a little history must
be incorporated. We must first
look back to the creation of the
American Negro.

Over 300 Hundred years ago,
people from a rich cultured land

' called Africa were forceably ex-

tracted from their native land,
Stripped bare of their remem-
berance of their African ties,
language and culture, and phy-
sically separated from their ac-
quaintenances, they were plac-
ed at the botton of the social-eco-
nomical ladder — that of a slave, a

— piece of chattel, a subhuman.

-ON THE MORBID economic
auction block, the black man was
emasculated of his manhood and
the black woman of her woman-
hood and dignity. The plantation
system then came along which in-
stilled in the black mind a depen-
dency and a subservient state on the

white man.

Then came the so-called “Eman-
cipation Proclamation” which lef
the Negro without a base to stand
on and orient himself to the
radical change. From then on it was
exploitation of his labor, will-pow-

— er, women and faith in the good-

ness of man. The Negro then be-

came a scapegoat for every perni-

cious idea the white had to get

 1 off of his mind.

From this brief essay on the
“before,” we can reasonably turn
to the “now.” Constantly, the
white man told the black he was
inferior, -less intelligent, lazy,
shiftless and “just no good.” The
white reinforced this negativism by
entirely omitting the black man’s
contribution to literature, the
arts, music, medicine, explora-
tion and whatnot.

’ THE BLACK FACE was not
seen on TV or his voice heard on
the radio. The only thing the ra-
dio’ and TV did was to reinforce
the white sterio types by such
programs as Amos-n-Andy, Roch-
ester on Jack Benny, The Little
Rascals and the former roles of
Stepin Fetchit. Everywhere one
looked it was all white and no
black. Self-hatred breeds in a
society where“ one’s identity is
constantly derided because of noth-
ing but color. '

Such farces as integration to
the white level and integrated
schools, churches, businesses,
country clubs only serve to rein-
force the idea that “white is right”
and ‘_‘black is ugly.”

Even in the black family, the
child sees the negatavism his par-
ents show during their battle with
the system and he is told again to
take a step back because onlyof his
skin color.

WHAT IS THE FINAL out-
come of this constant, deliberate
brainwashing? The Negro not
only hates himself in many cases,
but tragically hates his fellow
blacks. Told that black is evil and
constantly despised by the white
society, the black saw as the re-
presentative symbols of that ha-
tred, his fellow black brothers and
sisters.

a Do We Need It?

So we have a color limbo in
which the blacks are placed. On
one hand, blacks are striving to
maintain their own true identity
and also in some cases, to be ac-
cepted by the white society. One
finds blacks espousing black cul-
ture and history to learn their
proud heritage. There are those Ne-
groes who desperately want to
be accepted by the whites but the
cost is their blackness. These lat-
ter “Negroes” constantly strive
for white middle class values
of speech, behavior and ideals.
They shun association and with
blacks and always wind up apolo-
gizing for “those people” when
their “white friends” question
their behavior.

The greatest social compliment
is when they are-told “Why, you
don’t act like a Negro.” Self-hat-
red has claimed another victim.

ING of the black and of his po-
tential for growth, white brain-

Negro became the ‘Invisible Man.’_

Claom Dictatorship

 

 

The tremendous push last term to re-
move the stigma of “nigger” from the stu-
dent was woefully unsuccessful in attack-
ing the problem of student-faculty relations
at its most basic leve, in the classroom. '

The by-laws convention of the recently or-
ganized Faculty of the Arts and Sciences
(FAS) held during the reading period last
term points this up. It’s unfortunate that
only a few students attended the conven-
tion. Those present witnessed a more than
thirty minute debate about whether or not
students are part of the University_com-
munfrty.

THIS PRODUCED a tirade from a sur-
prising number of our belived professors
against student representation on faculty
committees in a voting capacity since
“most of us know what the students want
and we know what’s best for them.”

Luckily, this faction was defeated, the
outcome being that student representa-
tion was actually increased. On the legis-

‘ lative level, this sounds optimistic. But in

the classroom, students are still niggers.

The courses that I took last.term pro-
vide frightening examples. In a course deal-
ing with the explanation, analysis and com-
parision of political theories, the pro-
fessor set aside Friday as the day of the
week when students were permitted to
participate in the discussion: the other two
days of the week we were talked at.

He "would not recognize raised hands
on these days nor stay after class be-
cause he had previous "obligation." But
n_either‘would he come to the classroom
fiveminutes early. To top it off, office

ANOTHER EXAMPLE was a profes- '

sor could not be available for the schedul-
ed course-time, one hour three mornings a
week..Instead, she transformed the course
time into a three-hour class on Tuesday
nights. If students couldn’t work things out
with their employers, find transportation
back to campus (if commuters) or break
other commitments, they were forced to
drop the course. Two or three ended up by
doing this.

In neither instance was there any me-
chanism through which student niggers
could complain, protest or bring charges
effectively.

Yhere is no way through which students
can, form a power position, lobby, and

protest against dictatorship in the class-Iﬁ’ I

room, or the ridiculousness of cumulative
finals, which are in many cases the result
of the laziness of professors to give and
grade term-distributed exams and which are
no test of knowledge anyway since most
students cram painfully for these ordeals
only to forget everything soon after thay
hand in the exams.

IT IS OBVIOUS that a mechanism must
be established that does not assume
that the teacher is right a la high school_
A structure is needed through which the
student can protest getting the raw end of
the deal. '

How otherwise can students protect
themselves against the tyranny of profes-
sors like these?

Until we push for and obtain such a
structure, students arepniggers, not only
by the hands of admirii’strators.;.an_d fac-

No Lack Of Religion Here

The Editor of The Pitt News

from Alan. Ross Anderson. Chair— A

man. Department of Philosophy.
March 31. 1969

The editorial ' "Changing Times
II" of March 28. 1969

The enclosed letter was writ-
ten as soon as I learned of Father
Clancy’snarticle. He has inform-
ed me by telephone that his ar-
ticle was badly edited by the New
York Times, and that he had no in-
tention of suggesting that the. Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh was some sort
of religious desert. He also tells me
that he plans to try to correct the
impression created by his article as
published, and to make it clear
that his real interest was in get-
ting the University to estab-
lish a Department of Comparative
Religion and Theology. This is
certainly a legitimate interest,
though from my own point of
view there are other things that
come first: Black Studies, for ex-
ample.

The enclosed letter has nothing
to do with problems concerning
the establishment of such a depart-
ment, but only with Father Clan-
cy’s apparent complaint that the
only way to study religion “ser-
iously” at Pittsburgh is to take
courses in French. I feel confident
that Father Clancy and Rabbi
Rubenstein are as interested in
getting everyone clear about this
issue as I am. There are lots of
courses that deal with religion at
this University, and (as is point-
ed out below), there are majors
in the subject.

I should add that if the editors
of The Pitt News choose to edit
what I have said above (or be-
low) in the way that the N.Y.
Times has edited, according to

'Father Clancy, his own contribu-

tion, then I would rather have
mine not published at all.'

Or perhaps what was called for

But of course General Eisen-

to call these tactics to task for be-

It is a sad commentary indeed
that the university ‘recognizes the

course in Existentialism . . . of-
fered in the French Department.“

The Philosophy Department at
Pittsburgh. however. happens
at present to offer three-under-
graduate courses in the Philoso-
phy of Religion. another course
(not disguised in the slightest) in
Existentialism. and a related
course in Phenomenology. At
least six of my colleagues reg-
ularly offer undergraduate cour-
ses in the philosophy of religion
and closely related fields. More-
over. approximately one-third
of each of our introductory cour-
ses in philosophy is devoted to
problems in the philosophy of re-
ligion, so that a number of dif-
ferent view points may be pre-
sented.

But we also have in hand some
specialists: for example, the views
of one of my colleagues. Profes-
sor William W. Bartley. III. may
be found in The Retreat to Com-
mitment (Knopf. 1962; Chatto and
Windus. 1964). which deals
with the theology _of such figures

as Barth. Tillich, and Niebuhr. and .

in numerous essays on the philos-
ophy of religion which have been
published in such journals as The
New Republic, The New York Re-
view of Books, Harper’s, Com-
mentary, and Encounter.

If Clancy's real complaint is
that these courses are not taught
from a Roman Catholic point of
view. then I should report that
while Professor Bartley is admit-
tedly among the “very White Ang-
lo-Saxon Protestants“ of whom
Clancy writes. he had the privilege
during the past term of teaching
a course on Existentialism and the
Philosophy of Religion in colla-
boration with a Roman Catholic
priest who is a regular member of
the University of Pittsburgh fac-
ulty. Although no attempt was
made to disguise the instructors
own views. all prominent posi-
tions were presented sympatheti-
cally. I should note also that sev-
eralyears ago Professors Kurt
Baier and Nicholas Rescher made
arrangements with Duquesne Uni-

. ‘\n»\©

of Malcolm X but doesn‘t chose to
allow students who wish to attend
services or watch the Washington
cremonies without the penality of
missing important last classes.
General Eisenhower. though a ca-
reer military man. never felt that
noise or force countedlfor much in
resolving the problems, that beset
manking. I hope my school has not

  

versity (a Roman Catholic institu-
tion) for transfer of students. the
aim being that all students could
best learn about the topic from
those who were devoted to it.

I. have mentioned only what is
available in our department of
Philosophy on a‘ regular basis.
but Pitt also offers two separate
undergraduate majors in religion:
one is the History of Religion. and
one that is called the Interdepart-
mental Major in Religion. On the
graduate level. the University of
Pittsburgh‘s newest innovation in
religious studies is the Joint Pro-
gram in the Study of Religion. be-
gun in 1967. leading to the Ph.D.
in Religion. and being offered
jointly by the graduate faculties of
the University of Pittsburgh and
the Pittsburgh Theological Sem-
inary. There is also a Department
of Religious Education in our
School of Education.

In addition to these formal pro-
grams. dozens of faculty members
in various departments and
schools of the University give
courses and do research in such
areas as the Psychology of Re-
ligion. the Sociology of Religion.
Comparative Religion. and the
Literature of Religion. ‘ The
latter is apparently the only one
of which Clancy is aware. as is in-

dicated by his report that the,
French Department is offering.

a course in Existentialist Liter-
ature "in disguise as it were.”
There is no disguise at all . One
would expect a French depart-
ment to offer a course dealing
with contemporary French lit-
erature figures and philosophers.
and our French. department does
just that. '

Whatever one‘s attitude toward
the truth of various religious dog-
mas may be. no one denies that
they have had a profound and con-
tinuing impact on our civilization.
So have many other topics: mathe-
matics. philosophy. physics.  .
Any of these including religion.
can be studied as carefully and
sympathetically at the University
of Pittsburgh as it can at any
other university worth the name.

Yours truly.

German Reforms

Editor. The Pitt News:

The Department of Germanic
Languages would like to inform
the Pitt News and its readers
about certain curriculum changes
it plans for the fall trimester.

We have always had senior fac-
ulty members participating in
our beginning language pro-
gram and are now instituting a
system which will involve them
even more closely in the earliest
stages of language learning and
will also relieve first year teach-
ing assistants of sole responsibil-
ity for beginning classes. The
scheduled eightsections of Ger-
man 1 will be condensed into
four master classes which will
meet three times a week with a
senior faculty member. Each mas-
ter class will be divided into three
drill sections. which will meet
twice a week with a teaching as-
sistant. whose work will be close-.—
ly supervised by one of the parti-
cipating faculty members. The ad-
vantages _pf such a program are
obvious. The student has the ma-
terial presented by an ex-
perienced teacher and still re-
ceives a considerable degree of
individual attention. The supervis-
ion aspect of the program should
produce a better quality second-
year teaching assistant and thus
improve the quality of German 3
and  This system will of course
be extended into German 2 in the
Winter trimester and. if finances
allow, will eventually also be '
adopted for German 10 and 11.

The second change planned is
to lessen the emphasis on liter-
ature at the intermediate level.
This is in line with the recom-
mendations of the language chair-
men to the undergraduate coun-
cil. though the decisions on both
these changes predate those recom-
mendations. The department has
for some time been making ef-

’ forts to introduce cultural mater-

ial into its program and is now
making such material a fixed part
of the curriculum. The cata-

* logue description of German 3 is

being changed‘ to make it in-
clude both cultural and literary

reading material and German

has been completely revamped.
Beginning in the Fall, students
will be able to choose between sec-
tions in which literary material is

read and discussed and sections:
in which contemporary German‘-
life and the German contributions 
to civilization are treated. If there_j 

is a positive response to this
option, sections
scientific material willeventually
be added. '

We would appreciate your cal-F '..

ling this to the attention of your

readers. as many of them will___

unfortunately be involved in

schedule changes resulting from 7

these decisions. It is particular-

ly important that those few stu- 'f
dents who registered before the

registrar’s office was informed of

the changes be made aware of the" _-3

‘option in German 4. German 1 has
been condensed into four master

classes that will meet at 8,, 10, .
' 12 and 1. _ ,.
meet at the same time as the mas-  ,
ter class.) A literary and a cultur- ft 1 
al section of German 4 will be of- if 

(Drill sections will

fered at 11. at 12 and at 4 MWF.

(We hope that pairing sections at’ ’ 
each time will keep students from. Z i
being forced into a track they do”_ 
not want merely for the sake of 1

schedule convenience.)

These changes ‘represent our
effort to makeva positive and sub-

stantial response to student recom- - 

mendations about language teach-
ing at Pitt. They may go too far

for a few people, for some they 

certainlydo not’g‘o far enough, but
they are intended to make an un-

dergraduate education at Pitt of 
higher quality and more meaning- '_ 
ful to the student and the interna-  

tional society in which we all live

tday. They _are the product of  A

dialogue between teacher and stu-
dent. We hope this dialogue will

not be merely a passing phase, but ‘ ‘V -

will continue to produce fruitful
results for American educatipn,
and that it will not turn into a
monologue by either side.
Sincerely yours

How ‘They.’ Did It

Huston Letter
Editor: The Pitt News:

Recently one of your articles
carried a statement that some.
students were repeating that per-
enial statement “why don’t ‘they’
work their way up like we did."
In the winter term of ’68 I took
a course In Urban Geography
from Professor Kuntz. In the
census date we studied were the
following statistics.

From 1800 — 1960 the popula-
tion of Allegheny Co. had in-
creased from 478,000 to 380,000.
In one decade alone. 1830 - 1840,
the population increased 114

‘ per cent. as a result largely of mi-

gration from Germany and the
United Kingdom. By 1880 the pro- 4
portion of foreign-born had ris-
en to 30 per cent of the total pop-
ulation of Allegheny Co.

While in the rest of the six
country area of the Pittsburgh
metropolitan. area the population
increase stablized at 10 per cent,
in Allegheny Co. from 1860 —
1910 the population increased
again from 380,000 to 1.6-mil-
lion. In 1910’, the proportion of
foreign-born was 401,000.

-Add . the 2 first-and ‘_sec_oncl-gen- _

 

. eration descendents of earlier im-

migrants to the foreign-born pro-
portion in 1910 and I think you
will find that they constituted a
considerable majority of
population.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but
these figures suggest to me
that those of us who are descen-
dants of immigrants did
not so “work our way up peace-
fully through the ranks” as we
simply outnumbered the earlier
settlers of Pittsburgh and thus
gained the political power to force
change. And judging by the his-
tory books, those who had a stake
in the status quo were no more
interested in accepting change
than they are now. Only now in
many cases “we” have become
“they.”

It does not seem so unreasonable
to expect that the tactics used to
achieve change now for a minority
that cannot expect to become a

majority in the future that they

will be part of should differ from
the tactics used by a minority that
became a majority over the space
of a generation or two.

is the senior college of the New School for Social Research, an urban university
located in Greenwich Village with all of New York City for its campus. There
are three main New School units. One is the Graduate Faculty, a leading center
in the Social Sciences that offers training to 2,400 masters and doctoral students
under scholars like Economist Robert Heilbroner, Political Scientist Saul K.
Padover, and Philosopher Hannah Arendt. A second is the New School evening
division, which provides a vast range of courses, workshops, and lectures for
some 12,000 New -Yorkers annually, and serves as a major cultural center for the commun1ty-at-
large with programs of concerts, ﬁlms, modern dance and art exhibitions. The newest unit is the

NEW SCHOOL COLLEGE

an undergraduate program, limited to 500 students. The College offers a two-year program for
. students who have already completed their sophomore year elsewhere, and who are interested in
earning their B.A. with emphasis in humanities or social science, in a program which considers

undergraduate education important in itself.

Instead of lectures, every class,in_ the College is designed as a seminar, with about twenty students
sitting around a table to learn through participatory discussion. Instead of textbooks, the student
confronts the actual works produced by great minds of the past and the present—Aristotle and
Sartre. Freud and Erikson, Sophocles and Pinter. Marx and Marcuse. Shakespeare and Picasso,
Joyce and Antonioni. Instead of requiring its teachers to engage in specialized research and publi-
cation, the College has a faculty whose primary commitment is to teaching, and it frees them from
extrihsic demands so that they camconcentrate their talents on the instructional program. Instead
of taking a collection of unrelated courses, students take a Divisional Program—a set of courses
designed by the faculty to ﬁt together into a total educational experience. And instead of a “major,”
each student pursues his own Individual Study Program, in which he investigates, in considerable
depth and over a two-year period, a problem of his own choosing under the guidance of a tutor. .

The student takes three year-long courses during his ﬁrst year and two year-long courses during
his. second. This constitutes his Divisional Program. The rest ofhis time is spent in Individual Stud-
ies, which he initiates during his ﬁrst year and pursues for half of his time during his second year.

THE DIVISIONAL PROGRAM: Unlike most
colleges, we are not divided into specialized
departments like English, History, or Psychol-
ogy. We have only two Divisions—the Humani-
ties and the Social Sciences. The entering
student normally elects to study in either the
humanities or the social sciences, but may
choose to work in both.

The signiﬁcance of this unorthodox Divi-
sional structure is twofold. It means that the
student takes courses at an advanced level that
are genuinely interdisciplinary rather than nar-
r'owly specialized. And it means that the student
is free, in the Individual Study portion of his
program, to investigate ‘a ‘problem that deﬁes
the boundaries of conventional departments,
perhaps cutting across philosophy and drama,
or psychology and economics.

THE HUMANITIES: The humanities com-
prise all the creations of man—in music, paint-
ing, and literature, in history, science, and
philosophy. Yet at most colleges, a student who
wishes to study these creations at an advanced
level must limit himself arbitrarily to the study
of a single kind, and even to a single country
or period. There is no “department" at most
colleges that will allow him to major in both
Thomas Mann and Dostoyevsky, both Pinter
and Proust. And even when he limits his study
to one of these ﬁgures, the intellectual tools
that he requires for exploringthe ideas of that
writer in depth can only be acquired by_taking
courses in still other departments-philosophy
or theology or psychology. Similarly, a student
who majors in the conventional philosophy de-
partment cannot develop, within his specialized
courses, the aesthetic sensitivity that he needs
to penetrate fully the philosophy of thinkers
such as Plato and Nietzsche and Heidegger,
whose philosophic visions are expressed by
means of image. myth, and dramatic action no
less than by rational discourse. It_is for these
reasons that our study of the humanities is in-
terdisciplinary rather than fragmented into de-
partmental “majors."

We have designed a set of courses that ﬁt_

together into a comprehensive investigation of
the creations of man. It is possible for us in
a single course to juxtapose a treatise by Kant,
a novel by Barth, and a movie by Godard in
order to deal fully with the problem under in-
vestigation. The emphasis is less on assembling

information about particular works than on-

discovering the methods of understanding and
appreciation that can be applied to any work.
The goal is to provide tools of analysis that
will extend the student’s insight. into the hu-
manities when he pursues his own Individual
Study.

THE SOCIAL SCIENCES: The most worth-
while research in the social sciences tends to
involve two or more specialties simultaneously.
Schumpeter was an economist, but Capitalism,
Socialism and Democracy is as well philo-

sophic, political and historical. Myrdal is an.

economist, but The American Negro draws on
many ﬁelds. Arendt is a philosopher, but To-
talirarianism is historical, sociological and psy-
chological. And current efforts to understand
such diverse phenomena as the underdeveloped
nations, fascism, poverty, and hippies look to
all of the social science disciplines. We have
therefore constructed an upper-level program
in social science that is totally interdisciplinary.

The emphasis is on formulating new prob-
lems rather than learning the answers to old
problems, on mastering the methods by which
truth can be discovered rather than memo-
rizing the truths already known, and on under-
standing the seminal concepts that have proved
to be especially suggestive in illuminating so-
cial reality. The problems studied in this pro-
gram, as well as the readings, exhaust no
universe. establish no canon. deﬁne no ortho-
doxy. They provide a strong foundation on
which the student can build his Individual
Study program.

THE INDIVIDUAL STUDY PROGRAM:
One-quarter of the junior year and one-half
of the senior year are reserved for individual-
ized study. The student pursues his own spe-
cial interests under the guidance of a faculty
tutor and by means of the analytical tools he
is developing in the Divisional Program; his
work generally culminates in a written paper.
Some students form ther own seminars or‘en-
list members of the faculty to offer special
courses; others take courses from the vast
programs, graduate, undergraduate, and adult.
available at the New School for Social ‘Re-
search—courses taught by such visiting special-
ists as Paul Douglas, Rollo May, Bayard Rustin,
Leslie Fiedler, Lee Strasberg, Allen Ginsberg:
and others choose to work independently of
any course structure, under the direct super-
vision of their tutors. The possibilities for In-
dividual Study are initiated by the student
himself and limited only by his imagination
and intelligence.

THE INTER-DIVISIONAL CORE: At the
center of the Divisional Program are the
courses in which students and faculty from
both of the Divisions come‘together for inten-
sive collaboration on common concerns. Per-
haps no other aspect of the College embodies
as radical a departure from the dominant
trends in American education as this one.wl1ich
we call the Inter-Divisional Core. Its purpose
is to discover new intellectual arts for dealing
with the problems men confront when they
try to know and act. We conceive these in-
tellectual arts as modern adaptations of the
old “liberal arts,” whose original function was
to “liberate” men from old ways of seeing
and doing. ‘

The readings in these courses are drawn from
all the areas of knowledge—humanities, social
sciences, natural sciences, and philosophy.They
are selected to shed new light on some of the
fundamental issues underlying all knowledge
and activity, issues like‘ the relation between
fact and value, theory and practice, subjec-
tivity and objectivity, thought and action. In a
rigorous and serious manner. the courses in-
vestigate questions like these: Are there “arts"
"of discovery——intellectual strategies for hitting
upon new solutions to problems? Are there
any “hard facts" in the world—facts that can’t
be altered by the perspective from which they
are.viewed? lsthere a method for making one-
self into an innovator rather than a passive.
transmitter of outside forces?

THIS PROGRAM is now three years old. It has
drawn students from over 300 colleges and
universities throughout the U.S. Although it
emphasizesthe value of education for its own
sake, substantial numbers of its graduates have
been admitted to top-ranking graduate schools.
Tuition and fees are $1700. Most of the stu-
dents live in private quarters near the School.
We do not provide housing. We have no gym-
nasium. Only teachers. students, classrooms
and books.

Falling far short of its goal to unite all
the universities and colleges of Pennsyl-
vania against the threat of recently pro-
posed Harrisburg legislation, the Pennsl—
vania Association of College Students
(PACS) convened about 15 institutions
at Point Park College April 18-20 for a
semi-annual conference.

Founded about five years ago, PACS push-
es for student representation on all admin-
istrative committees with each school in or-

der to actualize the goal of “working within
the institutional structure to gain the
respect of both the administration and the
faculty.” The hope is to arrive at a feel-
ing of community.

’ On the state level, PACS strives to be-
come an effective lobbying union, repre-
senting student opinion in Pennsylvania
and feeding back to the respective schools
the machinations in Harrisburg which af-
fect and threaten them.

The conference was highlighted by the
discourses of three representatives from the
stone halls of the legislature — two sym-
pathetic to the position of students.

State Rep. K. Leroy Irvis kicked—off the
conference Friday night by approving of
student lobbyist unions which “need re-
presentation in Harrisburg as all the other
groups now have,” but he gave a few sug-
gestions about how to go about it.

The prominent black lawyer and legislator
advised to “first find out about your repre-
sentative to see what leverage can be us-
ed against him and secondly, have some-
thing to say in an organized, coherent
manner.”

He warned against writing block let-
ters and initiating mass postcard cam-
paigns.

While predicting the slow and unpub-
licized death of the Fleming Bill (No.
227), Irvis was adamant in pointing out the
danger that the new bills dealing with
a cutback in PHEAA aid, like Bills 320 and
19, are promising.

State Senator Fred Robbs reiterated Ir-
vis’ warning on the second day of the con-
ference. He labelled the push to change
all state aid into loan a product of
“political machinations.”

Hobbs inferred that Bill 320 was des-
troying the original goal of the PHEAA
program and turning it into a weapon
against dissenters.

However, a third speaker stood on the-

other side of the fence. Bob Young, law-
yer and executive assistant to State Sena-

tor George N. Wade, who has strongly sup-

ported the bills attacked by Hobbs and
Irvis, spoke in defense of the rationale be-
hind them.

He sat at the head of a long conference

  
    

JUDY VIRGINIA
tatives a list of seven ways the legislature

is attempting to control “violent demonstra-
tors.” His list included denying state funds

to involved students" and universities, em-

powering the universities to expell violators
of school rules ’and redefining the criminal

codes for academic munity.

In defending the more than twelve bills
proposed to clamp down on the univer-
sities in the last three months, Young be-
lieved that “if the reports reaching the
legislature of public reaction to student
violence are only a partial assessment of the
chaos, I believe a middle ground is no
longer workable.’ ’ t

In addition to public indignation, the
legislature according to Young is also re-‘
acting to pleas for help from the institutions
themselves. He refused however to sup,
ply any names or concrete information. I, “

The concluding day of the PACS conven-
tion was a grueling three hour session deal.-
ing with revisions of its constitution, the
bills discussed and elections ofofficers. A
resolution was passed which condemned
Bill 320. if

A ceremony held April 18, in‘
the Graduate School of Public:

memorated the change of name.
of the principal building of
the Department of Physics, ‘the-
Old Mellon Institute, to Alexan‘-Y

Dr. Allen, who died June 7, 1968
came here in 1939. For ten years.-
prior to this he had been asso-
ciated with the Bartol Foundation)‘
and the Biochemical Research
Foundation of the Franklin r..~.In-_'
stitutelin Philadelphia, where he“
designed and constructed one
of the earliest cyclotrons. A

He began construction of a sec-
on major cyclotron. Dr. Allen’s"
cyclotron reflected the scope of in-‘
dustry and in the city of Pitts-X ,
burgh. . g 

It was made of steel from‘U_. , I
S. Steel, aluminum and mach~, 5

equipment from Westinghouse. 
It used oil supplied by Gulf," and 
the magnet was fabricated by I
Mesta. In addition, financial sup- V
port was volunteered by Mrs. 
Sarah Mellon Scaife; i

Construction of the cyclotron,
however, was interrupted by the ,

“ Washington, D. C. - The
NAACP nationwide youth mobil-
zation for the passage of the re-
cent Washington legislation for
118 year old vote set itself a goal
.j of birnging more than 5,000 peo-
pleto the capitol on April 21-2.
n reality, the turnout did not ex-
 ceed about 350.

The Pittsburgh NAACP sent a
Kdelegation of about -38 people, 6
of whom were white. Taking off
"-from a location in the middle
S‘ "f the Hill District, at 5:30 a.m. a
="'char,tered bus chartered a group
aning from toothless old women
s to a,small boy of about six who
:'slept peacefully all during the
‘four hour trip but who turned
 into a placard-carrying dynamo
’ upon reaching Washington.

A The ‘bus, deposited it occupants
at the Hotel America, six blocks
from the Capitol. The national
 mechanism of the NAACP, with its
[spokesman in Miss Carol Quilloin,
took over and explained the ra-
-”tionale_behind the mobilization.
.“'I‘-wenty-one is no magic age
. _t—whicl1 to exercise one’s rights,”
‘began the NAACP Regional
?,‘"Youth Field Director for the
outheast.” People get mar-
ied at eighteen, pay taxes at
ighteen and should be granted
.».-full citizenship at eighteen.”

   
  
  
   
  
   
   
  
  
  
   
   
  
    
   
   
 
  
  
  
   
 
   
  
  
    
 
  
 
  
 
   
  
  
   
  
  
 
 
  
 
 
   
 
  
 
  
  
 
  
   
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
  
  
  
   
  
 
  
  
  
   
   
  
  
   
 
   
 

She went on to assess that low-
{ering the voting age to eighteen
would channel youthful concer-n
into the political process, pro-
_:’_vide a -needed transfusion» in
3‘?American politics and voting hab-
. ts and allow youth to assume the
-fundamental and valuable instru-
"7‘rnent for expression and participa-
 tion in the life of its society.

'N.Miss Quilloin and her com-
jjmittee provided statistics which
‘claim that 10 to 12 million peo-
—.p1e,fall into the 18-24 age group
{and that while the median age

45.1.

 The next organized assem-
“blage was held that night at
 the Metropolitan African Metho-
-“dist Episcopal Church. A packed
‘church was entertained by the
student choir from D. C. High
School, which performed songs
ranging from Handel's Messiah
to Fiddler on the Roof. A ros-
< trum of speakers pushed the theme
' . of the conference, highlighted by
the rhetoric of Clarence Mitchel
~III, D.C. Congressman.

1.Mitchell believed that the cor-
ruption in the political system can

of responsible voting. “Who gets
anything is determined by who is
elected,” he said. “Government
,_is. being run by a minority. If
you don’t participate, you can’t
expect the legislature and the gov-
ernment to be responsive to you.”

He went on to say that the
promise of change he’s with
young people. “Y oung people are
more mature than the old politi-
fcial hacks who always vote the
same way or the way their bosses
‘tell them to.”

 . The assembled state delegations
sat in the auditorium of the
,Senate Office Building and lis-
*tened to more than seven Congres-
“smen define their reasons for sup-
porting the 18 year old vote. In-
jcluded in the group was Senator
'_‘Ja_cob Javits, New York, who had

..that “you have an equation,

A significantly smaller group
convened in the Church that
evening for the roundup session
of the conference. The keynote
speakers were Rep. Louis Stokes,
Ohio, and Senator Edmund Mus-

Stokes, the first black man. to
serve on the House of Un-Ameri-

“To deny a man to vote while

DR. HALLIDAY
An Ovation

  

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Staff News Writer

In all-day marathon session, the Faculty of the Arts and
Sciences (FAS) passed on its by-laws and solved such issues as
whether or notstudents are dynamic members of the University
community. The by-laws convention with an attendance of some
170 faculty memberslwas held April 7 in Clapp Hall and pre-
ided over by Dr. Holbert Carroll, political science.

With the goal in mind to “continue as long as necessary to consi-

der the.draft paragraph by paragraph and to vote on proposed amend-
ments,” the FAS approved seven of the proposed 15 amendments.

First off, the group voted
against a motion to suspend the

’ rules and to allow fulltime insturc-

tors to vote on the by-laws, while
deciding later in themeeting to
include these same faculty mem-
bers as full voting members in fu-
ture decisions.

However, amendmens designat-
ing teaching graduate students
and Ph.D. candidates with teach-

' ing duties as FAS members were

defeated. All professors in the
tenure stream were voted in.
Original-ly drafted March 14, the
FAS by-laws were turned out and
defended at the convention for the

most part by Dr. Robert Newman, "
. chairman of the By-Laws Commit-

tee. Former Dean David Halliday
assisted the committee.

Where students were concerned,
a debate raged for more than 35
minutes around the question of
student representation on facul-
ty committees. A large body of
professors held the position that
students lack the ‘experience and
insight of their professors.

The opposing side pushed for an
increase in student representa-

tion in order to stabilize the con-,

cept of “community” \within the

University. The result of the de- ‘

bate was that student participa-
tion on the Undergraduate Council,
the Graduate ‘ Council and the
School of General Studies Council

 

was increased from three to five.

In addition to the increased stu-
dent representation on the Facul-
ty of the Arts and Sciences Cun-
cil (FASC) which is an elected sub-
group of the FAS, those present
voted to include two members of
the Black Action Society (BAS )' as
voting members of the FASC.

The FAS attacked the problem
of absentee ballotting by requir-
ing that [those members of the
FAS whocannot attend scheduled

meetings to submit a personal re- -

quest for an absentee ballot be-
fore the meeting. They then may
vote only on original proposals

and not on amendments, substitu-I ‘
tions or matters of parliamentary '

procedure.

Furthermore, items may be
placed onithe agenda for a meet-
ing by a petitionsigned by 40 mem-
bers of the FAS presented to the

FASC not less than 14 days before 7

the scheduled meeting. _

The participants, which had con- ‘
siderably dwindled in number-“by.

the end of the day, concluded by
the by-laws convention with a
standing ovation for Dr. Halliday

When the4FAS met in the closing days of the Winter
Term to discuss its proposed by-laws, the question of student
representation came to the front, The result was that:

—A large body of professors said that “students lack the ex-
perience and insight” compared to the professors.

—-While an opposing group pushed for an increase in stu-
dent representation “in order to stabilize the concept of
community within the University."

 

for “his-outstanding devotion to
democracy which has made this
demonstration possible.”

A group of more than 100 faculty members. medical students. phy-

"We are firmly opposed to the
development and deployment of

' no matter how limited in sizeor

against the "thin” Sentinel Syst-

 —The ABM will initiate a spiral-

therefore, will not result in any

 —There are -many technical

Washington, Part 2 f

Scott, Schweiker Absent 

The two Pennsylvania Senators. Hugh Scott and
Richard Schweiker. were absent from the group of
US senators speaking before the NAACP Youth
Mobilization Conference.

Senator Scott. however. sent a representative.
Miss Carol Reed. who explained his view on the 18
year old vote. "The senator is in favor of lowering
the voting age state by state. However. before he
makes up his mind on the constitutional amendment
to lower the age. he is waiting for the results of the
judiciary committee that is investigating the idea."

Miss Reed explained that Senator Scott wants to
besure that the 18 year old vote would be bene-
ficial to the country before he backs it. "He‘s not
against it." she emphasized. "But, it's just not his
thing."

.Scott’s opinion on student protests, according to
Miss Reed, is that “as long as they’re orderly,
they re okay. ’ The senator “believes that people

 
 
 
   
   

shouldhave the right to protest,” she explained.

“The Pitt News” in an attempt to interview Sen-
ator Schweiker in his office. talked with his legis-
lative assistant. Mr. Burke. He explained that the
senator was one of the co-signers of the bill to es-
tablish the 18 year old vote.

"The senator.” said Burke. “feels that the 18
year old vote should be gained through a constitu-
tion amendment, rather than state-by-state."

When asked about the senator’s opinion on stu-
dent up-risings, Burke said that the senator had
voted for the bill to allow colleges to cut off aid to

student demonstrators. “However,” he empha-

sized, “the senator voted against requiring the col-
leges to do so.” J

When questioned on the Fleming Bill, Mr. Burke
stated, “I don’t know anything about this, and I
don’t think that the senator does either.”

In an attempt to improve the stu-
dent representation and the over-
all quality of the student voice at
the University. The Pitt News is
asking that all students who feel
they have something to submit to
the paper do so immediately.

All material from art work to

short fiction. including poems. ar— -

ticles. cartoons. columns and
news interpretations will be ac-
cepted. and the best material will
be published.

No student. faculty member or
administrator will be required to
contribute on a regular basis. but
it is hoped that many more mem-

bers of the University community
will contribute when they feel they
have something to say.

The effort is being made as a
result of a student opinion poll
taken in the final issue of the

winter term. We, the staff, can-

not hope to cover all areas of Uni-
versity life. But, the paper can be
representative of the entire stu-
dent body, if the entire student
body contributes to it.

Deadline nights during the

US Senators Praise

by ANNE DORN
Staff News Writer

WASHINGTON, D. C. — A repre-
sentation of US senators voiced
emphatic endorsement of the 18
year old vote to an eager crowd at-
tending the NAACP Youth Confer-
ence. The senators spoke at an as-
semblv held the second day of the
conference in the Senate Audi-
torium at the Capitol.

Opinion was divided between
supporting lowering the vote on
the state level or at the nation-
al level, but all the senators who
spoke supported the 18 year old
franchise. Said Senator Thomas
Eagleton, state government offi-
cial, “The franchise ought to be
granted to those who want to be
participants."

One weekend A
Major Smith,

Lieutenant Schaffer,

The senators’ general opinion
seemed to reflect the national
consensus. Senator Edward Brooke
(Rep., Mass.) stated that a re-
cent national poll claimed 69 per
cent of the population favored a
lowering of the voting age.

   

As Senator Brooke entered the
auditorium, the audience broke in-
to a loud and lingering applause,
and television cameras and lights
switched on to record his com-
ments. “When people between 18
and 2l'can’t vote, it creates apa-
thy. They have to go outside the
system.” He pointed out the im-
provements in mass media and ed-
ucation which have increased the
ability of the 18 year old to vote.

Senator Brooke, along with sev-
eral other of the speakers, em-

:

and a beautiful blonde

named Mary

phasized the importance of letters
and local support in communities
to force action on the movement
of the vote.

One of the best arguments to use
in convincing people, said Sena-
tor Gerald Ford (Rep, Mich.) was
that “young people have earned
the" right to participate in a mean-
ingful _ way.” He urged avoiding
cliches like “old enough to fight,
old enough to vote.”

Two senators supported lower-

1 ing the voting age through a state-

by-state process, without the con-

-stitutional amendment needed to
do so on the federal level. Senator

Carl" Albert, Majority leader from
Oklahoma, urged the audience to
pass the bills in the states. “Every
-time you pass’ the 18 year old
vote in one state, you increase your
power in the Senate.”

 Senator‘ Howard Baker, Jr.
,(Rep., Tenn.) said that he propos-
‘ed-a compromise bill in the Senate

1  to lower ‘the voting age to 18 on a

federal level for those elections
involving "federal officials only.
He believed that thestates have
the right to decide their own vot-
ing qualifications.

He perceives theleventual lower-
ing of the voting age as a natural
phenomena, just as the removal
of past qualifications, such as race
and sex, has beensuccessful.

Senator Albert stated that “black-

stated that student dissent may be
caused by a lack of an effective

Senator Jacob Javits (Rep.,

the NAACP in its drive to lower

‘Charity’ Needs Charit

by TOM MILLER
Staff Feature Writer

Faith, hope, and charity abide,
but the greatest of these is char-
ity. The Corinthians learned
their lessons over 2000 years ago
from Saint Paul That lesson is still
playing, only this time at a dif-
ferent theatre. The Nixon down-
town.

Charity Hope Valentine is a big
girl with a little girl heart, who
is so filled with faith and hope
that she gives her heart, when it
isn’t breaking, to almost anyone.
Charity wants- someone to love
her,-*-and while this sounds pretty
simple, for a simple girl like Char-
ity love always seems to scald in-
stead of warm. This is the ‘girl
who_se “fiance” steals her pock-
etbook and then pushes her off
a bridge. .

But Charity persists, unable
to escape that “fickle finger of
fate.” “Your’re you and I’m me,”

“iffy”

she says, running around New-

York and throwing her heart to
any receiver, fake or not. The plot
comes originally from a Fellini
movie "Nights of Cabiria,” but you
hardly need that information to
understand Charity. '

Charity is a dance hall hos-
tess, so, naturally or not, “Sweet
Charity” is a dancing movie. No
doubt the real reason is to make
you forget that no one in the
movie can really sing that well.
But they do dance. From Lincoln
Center to Wall Street they dance.

From El Morocco style night’

clubs to Roseland type dance halls
they dance . . . and dance. Oh,
what Bugsby~Berkley and M-G-M
could have done with this movie.

This time, though, the 500
chorus girls prancing on the block-
long keys of a twelve story piano
are out, and Bob Fosse is in. As
director and choreographer, Mr.
Fosse has filmed what amounts to
a pretty decent ritual offering to
the goddess Terpsichore. The
dances have taste and style, but
they look a little too familiar,
come in all to predictably, and
seem just a little_ too typical of
movie musical dancing. This does
not mean they are necessarily bad.
They are good, but, in a few years
I fear they will be looked upon as
the musicals of the thirties are to-
day. The movement-is flawless,
however, and a few times becomes
exciting.

Since the music has been turn-
ed, in most cases, into simply
a vehicle for the choreographer,
there is little to say about it, ex-
cept that is succeeds in provid-
ing strong march and frug num-
bers for Bob Fosse’s dancers.
“Where am'I going” is an excel-
lent an expression of Charity’s de-
spair as “If My Friends Could
See Me Now” is of her exceeding
joy at spending the night with-
afamous Italian movie star.

In the program credit for the
screenplay is given to ‘Peter
Stone, but if memory is reliable,
the funniest lines are left over
from the legitimate version by Neil
Simon. “Sweet Charity” was
not Simon at his best, but it was
Simon, and that makes it fun.
Peter Stone has maintained
much of the Simon quality and the
fun still runs wild.

There are two particularly wel
done, or at least appropriate
scenes, in which the blaring» an
whirling stops, and a montage :6
shots reveals Charity as herself
apart from the freaky world '
which she lives. Scenes li
these, constrasted to t_
overwhelming gloss of the res
of the movie save Charityfa_‘n_
her gang from becoming adanc:
school demonstration film with“
plot. The film has a pleasant con
tinuity between ' private Char}
tiy and public Chairity that make’
it rather engaging at times. 0 '

The center of all the fun is sup
posed to -be Charity, and thatli
Shirley MacLaine. Miss Mac
Laine is not a dancer, a fact shf

ie. She is _not a singer, a fact sh

ue-Gold Game

QUARTERBACK CHUCK WINTERS'tosses the football on Pitt Sta- ’

dium’s grassless turf, during an earlier spring practice drill. Winters
ranks as the No. 3 signal-caller going tinto the fall practices. Winters
completed 3 of 5 passes during the annual spring game.

Friedl completed ten passes in
twenty-five attempts, good for
229 yards. But the transfer from
the Citadel was also intercepted
twice.

The 5-9 junior quarterback com-
pleted a pass-catch combination
that had all new faces from last
year’s starting offensive unit. Last
year’s No. 1 tight end, George Med-
ich has not participated in the
spring drills. Medich is also the
No. 1 pitcher on the baseball
team, and the 6-5 pass-‘catcher
has been spending the spring toss-
ing goose eggs against opposing
nines. '

Junior Bill Pilconis, who caught
4 passes for -57-yards, provided
a big target for Friedl, substi-
tuting for Medich.

Last year’s No. 1 receiver,
split-end Skip Orszulak was also
missing from the air attack. Or-
szulak, who graduated and head-
ed for San Diego’s summer camp,
was replaced by sophomore Steve
Moyer. ‘

“He needs polishing,” ex-
plained DePasqua, “but he show-
ed us that the has a lot/ of talent.
He can catch.”

Moyer shared pass-catching hon-
ors in the Blue-Gold Game with
Pilconis, grabbing four tosses. One
was a pass from halfback Ferris
on a flea-picker play.

The Blue team’s quarterbacks
also had relative success in the
air. Chuck Winters completed
three of five passing attempts, and

sophomore Joe Delisio converted

on six of ten tosses.

But on the ground, the 1969
Panther editor, was less success-
ful. The Whites gained only 78’
yards rushing in the annual spring
game, and the Blues were even
less effective with a dismal 12
yards in the plus column.

“We have to improve our run-

“We’ll have to strengthen the

As for predictions for next year’s

“They feel that they can do bet-

Before the 1969 Panthers ever trotted on Pitt Stadium’s gras-
sless football field, the annual Blue-Gold Game seemed to have
all the possibilities of being marred by another sixty minutes
of Pittdome. The first sign was the program, which was dated,
April 26, 1968.

Last year’s 1968 Blue-Gold Game program introduced a grid
team that boasted of a winning season, “the year the Panther be-
gins to growl.” The footballers played slopDV that game, but ex-
head coach Dave Hart and his players blamed the pouring rains
and the muddy field. Inventing excuses became a more arduous
task as the Panthers lost regularly during the fall and went on to
a third straight 1-9 season. V ’

Saturday’s small turnout witnessed Pittdome on the very first
play when John Moss carried the ball, fumbled, and then drove
head first to recover the ball. The promising sophomore half-
back sufferer a head injury on the play and was unable to
see further action. ‘

Two plays later, Blue quarterback Chuck Winters

/
threw

_ his first pass and was promptly intercepted by sophomore de-

fensive back Craig Kugler. The White team, the first-string of-
fensive unit, took over and on the third play, junior transfer from
the Citadel, Jim Friedl threw his first pass and was also inter-
cepted. '

But the tide turned from Pittdom, and the men of DePas-
qua began to show signs of a truly new look. There was the
end-around run which worked twice for four yards on carries
by lanky 6’6, former high school hurdles star Bill Pilconis.
There was the 57-yard screen pass to Denny Ferris that result-
ed in a touchdown. And there was the 73-yard bomb thrown by
Friedl to wingback J ..D. Lewis.

Even the coaching staff had a new look. Offensive coach
Bimbo Cecconi was donned in a deep blue spread-collar shirt
with French cuffs, and slacks. Linebacker coach Ray May was at-
tired in a pink shirt, and slacks of a slightly deeper pink color.
And DePasqt{a was wearing a black suit in his first appearance
in Pitt Stadium as head coach.

However, the reversal of that Pittdom tendency may have
been merely an illusion. ,— No-one was outstanding. Not even
Friedl who passed for two‘ touchdowns and 229 yards, but who
completed only 10 of 25 passes andvwas intercepted twice.

Last year the Panthers looked promising in the spring prac-
tices and pre-season fall Scrimmages, but then they stopped
playing each other and that illusion of a dream season was
shattered by the harsh realities of comparative ineptness

“_You can’t evaluate when you play against yourself,”

said De Pasqua after the Blue-Gold Game, “but overall I was
extremely pleased with the conclusion of the drills.

The real test begins September 20, when the Panthers open
another season in UCLA’s hugh, scary Colisseum. That’s when De-
Pasqua and his staff lead their newly revamped offensive and de-
fensive units against the opposition. Defeating the Uclans and

, then rugged Oklahoma on the road is more than a difficult task,

it’s an improbability. All this reporter wants to see is a respec-

’ table football team, not another assemblage of uniformed bod-

ies destined for Pittdom.

DePasqua   Lands Two Footballers;
Recruit List Totals Sixteen Stars

Coach Carl DePasqua announced this week the addition of
two more football prospects for next fall. Ernie Webster, a 6-3,
215 pound tackle and end from Calvin Cooledge High School
in Washington, D.C., and Joe Siemanski, a 6-4, 218-pound tack-
le from ‘Wyoming Valley West in Swoyersville, Pennsylvania,

are the 15th, and 16th- recruits.

The other fourteen freshmen
football signees are the follow-
ing:

George Feher -— a 6-1 200-pound
linebacker from Aliquippa

High School.

Tom Hasbach —-— a 6-1, 180-pound
quarterback from Baldwin High
School

Myron Kunka — a 5-11, 190-pound
halfback from Monessen High
School

Mike Grahovac —- a 6-5, 245 pound

tackle from Aliquippa High
School

Dean Arlett — a 6-4. 200-pound
end from Sto-Rox High School
in Stowe Turnpike. Pennsyl-
vania. V

Jim Parros -- a 6-2. 185 pound

Gary Patterson —- a 6-2. 235-pound

Stubenville High School in
Stubenville. Ohio.

Mark Ludwikowski — a 6-1, 220-
“pound fullback from Wyom-
'ﬁg'Va1ley West High School.

George Yatron — a 6-1, 210-pound
center from Reading High
School

Richard Oldshue — a 6-5. 220
pound tackle and end from
Irondeouoit High School
Rochester. New York.

Joe Kovacic — a 6-1. 235 - pound
tackle from Churchill Valley
High School.

Paul Yuna — a 6-3. 215-pound
center and linebacker from
South Allegheny High School
in Port Vue. Pennsylvania.

Bill Mercer —- a 6-2. 210-pound
. guard from Mt. Lebanon High
School

Presently, DePasqua’s biggest
problem is landing football pros-
pects for next year’s squad is an in-
ability to recruit quarterbacks.
Of the sixteen signees. only Has-
bach is listed as a quarterback.
But DePasqua has other quarter-
back prospects in sight. and chan-
ces are that quarterbacks will be
the remaining two scholarship

Medich Hurls Mitters To. irsts

by ED CONLEY

Both George Medich and Ron O’Grodnik had rocky starts
Wednesday, but before they were through the two mitters had
settled down. In fact, they did more than settle down. They
carried Bobby Lewis’ Panther nine to their second win in four
games, a 2-1 squeaker over Grove City.

The first batter Medich faced hit a routine grounder to O’Grod-
nik, who was starting at short stop for the first time this spring. O’Grod-
nik fielded the ball well enough. but his throw pulled first baseman

Frank Gustine off the bag.

' Medich proceeded to give up
a couple of singles a_nd hit a bat-
ter. A base hit by Jack Mackert
put the mitters in the whole, 1-0.

Then, Medich and O’Grodnick
took over. O’Grodnik banged
out a triple to right-center in the
bottom half of the first, scoring
Bob Solonickne to even the score.
Center fielder Joe McCain’s
‘single to left brought O’Grodnik
home with the winning run.

Diving Catch Saves Score

No one else touched home af-
ter that initial inning. And Med-
ich turned into a master on the
mound, surrendering only six hits
while striking out nine. Medich
didn’t walk anyone.

The mitter ace made it two
wins in two starts with that per-
formance, and he has yet to let
an earned run cross theplate.
Medich went 8-2/3 innings in
the opening victory over West-
minster, April 21. Two unearned
tallies ruined Medich’s shut-
out attempt in that one.

“Medich looked stronger —- the
whole way — in this game,” Lew-
is said after the triumph over the
Grovers.

“At one time he let up,”
though, Lewis continued. “He
tried to pace himself. You’ve got
to bear down all the time.”

Lewis was talking about the
fifth inning. The bottom part of
the line—up came to the plate-in.
that inning and they stung the
ball a bit. A great diving catch
near the right field foul line by
Solonickne saved a run. The two
batters that followed slashed out
basehits, but Medich reached
back and fired a couple of third-
strike tosses past the Grovers’
Bruce Wright and Buz Sawyer.

Tom Stromp is a lonely man this season.

The senior netter from Pittsburgh is winning and he’s win-
ing consistently. His individual wins have provided most of the
few bright spots in the tennis picture this spring.

Stromp, a two-year letterman, is one of only two veterans return-
ing from last year’s 7-8 net squad. Last year he posted the best won-
loss record on the team while playing as number three man. Thissea-
son he’s moved up to the number one spot and he’s continued to ‘win

both in ‘singles and doubles.

Netters Host
California St;

Hopes Bleak

' Tuesday might have been the
luckiest day of theyoung sea-
son for coach Ben Pope’s ten-
nis squad. The netters rematch
with West Virginia was rain-
ed out. '

Because of the heavy schedule

during the remainder of the month,

it is unlikely that the match will
be rescheduled. It is also unlike-
ly that this fact will induce Pope
to hammer walls or kick water
coolers. In the previous match,
WVU crunched the netmen 8-1.
While Pope’s number one man
Tom Stromp won the only con-
test, the Mountaineers demolish-
ed the other netters by sweeping
the remaining singles sets. Five
of those were by shutout scores.

Pope is undecided as to whether
his squad has improved any since
_that first match. "It’s possible
that we. might have gotten one

I more point. But thatfs justa,_gues_s.”

Despite his wins, however, Tom ,

has been disappointed with his
game so far this spring. “I’m not
'playing well,” he related. “The
competition might be better at
number one, or than again may-
be I'm worse. I’m in a rut right
now. I'm just concentrating on

winning. I can’t get loose and-

relax. I can’t let upat all.” -
Tom indicated that the weakest

“part of his game right now is his‘

return of serves and he plans to
spend some time improving it. "I
don’t practice enough,” he ad-
mitted. “I’ve got to practice, es-
pecially my returns.” 4

As a team, the netters are cur-
rently winless this spring and the
outlook isn’t good for the remain-
der of the season. “I thought In-
diana would be our easiest
match," Tom explained. “But we
lost that one 7-2.”

“We’re having a lot of prob-
lems on the team,” he contin-
ued. “And the trimerster sys-
tem has caused most of them.”
Stromp cited the fact that a lot
of potential tennis players leave
campus after finals in April. The
bulk of the tennis schedule,
meanwhile, falls in May.

‘fIt_’s hard to ask a guy to give
up a job just-to stay and play
tennis,”

   

he added_.»_“You can’t," _ _
l '  l.th]€n.... " '

his mound opponent. '1'he mit-
ters banged out one hit in every
inning after the first (for a total
of ten), but the lefty wouldn’t
let anyone else get beyond sec-
ond base.

“Sawyer was tough when he

I had to be. We didn’t bunch our

hits off him,” Lewis stated. ‘‘I
didn’t think we'd score many
runs.” ‘

The only real problem for Saw-
yer was a shortstop named O’
Grodnik. The mitter got two more
singles in the game, finishing
the tilt at 3-for-4. The only time
Sawyer got O’Grodnik out was
in the sixth inning when the

"shortstop led off with a hard

smash right at Grover center
fielder, Ron Petre.

“It helps to have O’Grodnik,”
Lewis said. He looked good to-

Drives In Winning Run

anything. We have a list of guys
on campus that could be playing
for us that would murder the first
six men on the team right now.”

Spring football and ineligibili-
ties have also cut into the tennis
roster, according to Stromp. “The
conditions we have to play under
are really bad. It’s so‘ hard; to play
spring tennis on “the trimester
system.”

Meanwhile, Tom Stromp con-
tinues to win. It’s been pretty
lonely in the winner’s circle this
spring. ’ .

       
 
      
   
      
    
 
        
     
     
       
       
      

day. He hit the ball hard and
wasn’t bad in the field.”

The only other mitter to hit
safely more than once was catch-

er Sammy» Glass. The -receiver, .

who was also starting his first
game of the spring, had a two-for-
three day. Petre went two-for-
three day. Petre went two-for-four
for the Grovers in their third loss
in six games. ,

The mitters have had eight
games wiped off the boards by
rain, putting them ahead of last
year’s “wet” season when seven
games were halted. The bad
weather. certainly isn’t a strang-
er to_Lewis. Once, thirteen games
were cancelled during a spring.

The games that the mitters
did get to play during the tri-
mester break were the victory over
Westminster, and losses to Buf-
falo (15-12) and Bucknell (4-3).

The difficulty in those losses
was fielding. In the high-scor-
ing contest against Bucknell, the
mitters matched their conquerers

Richey of Pitt (3:58.6), Larry Zul-
lerjof Syracuse (4:10), Carl Hat-
field of West Virginia (4:11.6),
and Al Sheaffer of Penn State all
expected to lock up in a tight duel.
Another good battle is expected
in the shot put between Penn
State’s Mike Reid (573/4”), Roger

remarked Ban- _

Taylor of Syracuse (55' ), and Pitt's
Greg Ellis <53‘ ).

Other top individuals include:
Bryant Salter (Pitt) in the high
jump ('6-10) and triple jump (49-
11); Smitty Brown (Pitt) 9.8 in
the hundred and 4.7 in the 440;
Dan Kouvolo (Pitt) in the javelin
(236-11); , John Cabiati (Penn
State) in the high jump (6-10);
Ken Brinker (Penn State) in the
hurdles) Reg Corbett of West Vir-
ginia in the pole vault (15-2);
and Guy Roberts of Syracuse in
the 440 (49.2).

In the 120 high hurdle compe-
tition, Dave Brinn will be the thin-
clad’s lone entrant. “Dave’s a long
way from in shape,” commented
Banner. “This will be his first
race of the year due to a muscle
he pulled back in January.”

Bryant Salter, thinclad hopeful
in-the high jump and triple jump.
has also had his problems keeping
well. Bryant spent the past week-
end in bed in Des Moines, 1a., with

a case of tonsilitis. He was there '

along with Jerry Richey and Dan
Kouvolo for the Drake Relays. The
heel injury which he suffered ear-
lier this year is also still plaguing
him.

The intermediate hurdles com-
petition will be handled by Carlos

Reisen and Wally Swiger. Mike _

Nolan, Mark Vornhagen and‘Jer-
ry Richey will handle the chores
in the two mile race.

Admission will be free. Medals
will be awarded to the top three
place winners and the Athletic
Directors’ Trophy will be present-
ed to the team champions.

Ridl Announces Three 4

HS Roundball Recruits,
Civic Arena Contests

During the trimester break, basketball coach Buzz Ridl an-
nounced that three Western Pennsylvania high school roundball
stars will attend the University next fall.

The first catch was Carl Morris who was selected to the All-Section
12B Post-Gazette and WPIAL teams last season. Morris. who stands
6-6. played center for Braddock High School. '

The second catch was Bill Sul-
kowski who was also selected to
the All-WPIAL Team. Sulkowski's
decision to enter Pitt in the fall
ended a 78-school chase at land-
ing the Canon-McMillan star.

Sulkowski, a big 6-8 center, av-
eraged 22 points and 14 rebounds
per game during this past season.
He also shot at a 48 per cent clip
from the floor. 7

announced that there will be a
Summer Softball League dur-
ing the spring session.

The league is open to all stu-
dents, faculty, and staff. Stu
dents not enrolled in -either of
the two sessionsof the summer
term, but who were enrolled in
either of the first two trimes-
ters, are eligible to participate.

The slow pitch softball league
will consist of 10-man

Ridl‘s most recent recruit is
scorer and playmaker Don Wilson.
a local star from Penn Hills High
School. Wilson averaged 20 points

per game in leading the Indians to -

a remarkable 23-4 record last sea-
son.

The slick ball-handling guard
was selected to the West Penn All-
Stars for the 1969 P-G'Dapper

‘ Dan Roundball Classic and the

WPIAL Team. Wilson measures
only 5-6. ‘

“We feel that he can do the job,”
said Ridl, about his undersized re-
cruit. “He’s an exciting local star
and a lot of people will want to see
him play.”

Recruiting two tall basketball
prospects is not the only headway
that Ridl has made during the off-
season in an attempt to give the
University a big-time basketball
team. Arrangements for some of
the home games to be played at
the Civic Arena are now being
made.

  Golfersl-lope To Shake Recent Trend;  

Scores,WeatherMonotonousRoutine

by BILL NAAB

The score, 4-3, has been a regular happening for the golf team. Again last Tuesday the score
ended in a 4-3 decision. Of the six matches that Rex Peery’s Linksters have participated in, 4
have ended by that same, 4-3, score. Two were victories.

In damp, dreary weather Tuesday, West Virginia edged Peery’s golf squad as the Lynn

brothers, Jack and Rick, to-
gether with Bruce Keagy and
Mike Pirih scored victories for
the Mountaineers.

John Meteney, Ray George, and
Charles Patrick pulled through
for coach Peery. Meteney was
the medalist with a 72 score,
which according to Peery "was
amazing in that rain.” Meteney
had been selected as team cap-
tain before the St. Vincent match
April 22.

‘Last Friday, Meteney also had
the chance to be the hero. A play-

off between Meteney and Clar- =

ion’s Al Weingartner determined
the winning team. Both com-

petitors parred the first three holes.

The, Weingartner parred the
next three holes, while Meteney
bogied. Thus, Clarion managed
a 4-3 victory.

Meteney has yet to be beaten
at Shannopin Country Club, the
linksters home course. Next

.the

Tuesday, the linksters will be
involved in a three way match
against Kent State and Indiana
State University. Peery stated,
“Meteney will get a true test
against Indiana.” He indicated
Indiana has two superb
golfers, either of whom will be
able to give Meteney a stiff
challenge.

“Indiana has one of the better
teams in the state, and Kent State
always has a pretty good team,”
Perry remarked.

Up to the present time, _West-
minster has been regarded as the
toughest opponent. The 6-1
verdict which the Titans handed
Peery’s linksters "remains as
the most lopsided score of the
season.

Both of the squad’s victories
have been achieved through extra
hole playoffs. The victims were
Bucknell andySt. Vincent. How-

ever, the linksters have lost two
straight home matches since the
Bucknell victory April 4. After
Tuesday’s match at Shannopin,
Perry said, “West Virginia play-
ed like they played on the course
everyday. Some’ of our guys
played like they never saw it.”

Regardless of those setbacks,
Perry believes that his squad
is improving. v“A lot depends on
the weather,” he said. “In a cold
rain improvement doesn’t show.
But, there’s been some nice days.
Then, we’re not playing golf,
though.”

Peery will cross his fingers
during the next week because on
May 9 his squad will travel to
Cornell University to compete in
the Eastern Golf League cham-
pionships. The coach will be hop-
ing for constant improvement and
plentyrof nice weather before the
tourney.

Since Peery has coached the

golf team (five years), no one

has qualified for the 16-man play-
off in the Easterns. The 16, men
with the lowest scores meet in a
playoff and then play again the

. next few days until nearly every-

one has been eliminated. But,
until then Peery would like to
notch a victory or two on the sea-_

son's record, even if the scores

should turn out to be 4-3 decis-
ions.

Winless N etmen

  Play Tomorrow

‘(Continued from Page 17-)

Tomorrow at 1:00 p.m., the net-
ters host California State. The
prospects for victory, according
to Pope, appear no brighter than
they did against WVU. “Cal-
ifornia would have to be awfully
weak to lose to us. They always
have a good team. They’ve knock-
ed us off the past five years.”

Thus, because of a number of
factors not unusual at the Univer-
sity, the tennis team appears doom-
ed to l?ittdom.

Du Pont wants engineers who want to grow
professionally. And we have great respect for
the guy who’d like to “know more about it” be-
fore he marries a speciﬁc kind of job. We even

have a plan to help him.

It’s called “planned mobility”—a' sort of
intramural job hop. You don’t get into a train-
ing program. You get into a job. If it doesn’t ﬁt
you‘, or you it, you get into a second job or a ﬁfth
or a sixth, until you ﬁnd the one you want to
grow with. It gives you time to decide while
you’re broadening professionally. ‘

Ask the Du Pont interviewer about it. Ask
him anything. He was inyour shoes very

recently.

Mr. Doan:

lWl‘HEl""c$»‘ @21.l‘@E'ﬂ‘@'    

Dear Mr. Doan:

Just once and for all—will business admit
that it does make mistakes? Over and over
again we see the major corporations
stamping out criticism as they cover up
flaws. Somehow the "ethics" always

i seem to get lost in the rhetoric.

Several notable cases come to mind, the
most recent being the much-publicized
affair of the General Motors Goliath
versus'Ralph Nader. Here Big Business
exposed itself as being oversensitive to
constructive criticism—as well as callous in
its ignominious attack on its critic.

Surely, while we don't expect Big Bllsiness
to change its ways overnight, we can
expect a rational consideration-

and not merely a cover-up job.

Yet the Nader episode is not unique.

One recalls a similar overreaction—-and
this time by the chemical industry—to
Rachel Carson's exposé on indiscriminate .
uses of insecticides. The Big Business
response to Jessica Mitford's eye-opening
portrayal of the realities of the funeral
business was equally bitter—not so much
against her arguments in "The American
Way of Death" but against the author
herself. In none of these instances did
business admit its imperfections on its
own accord. Only public pressure——-and the
fear of continued negative pub|icity—was
able to draw out the truth about auto
hazards, bug sprays and casket costs.

It's instances like these that prove business
is responsible for the myth that it sees

' only the facts it wants to see. It's

instances like these that reinforce the
image of business justifying any means
that maximize the ends—the ends being
monetary profit. It's as if Mammon
himself had updated the business

code of ethics.

Twentieth Century Big Business appears
to be nothing more than a reincarnation of
the Nineteenth Century stereotype, the.
Robber Barons. Jay Gould's stock-market‘
rigging has its 1961 counterpart in G.E.
and Westinghouse price-fixing. We have
our Billie Sol Estes and our Bobby Bakers.
Today's business covertly sanctions such
noble practices as bribes, kickbacks,
company callgirls and tacit collusion.

The "ethics" of Big Business have
created a business unto itself—industrial
espionage. Here anything goes——from
duplicated office keys to parabolic
microphones. And even packaging frauds
are becoming more and more blatant

in today's age of the 10—ounce

giant economy size.

Thus, when college youth are asked,
"What's wrong with Big Business?", we
answer most simply, "What's right with
Big Business?" Very little, it seems.
Sincerely, ' 
Stan Chess
Journalism, Cornell

WEI?

Dear Mr. Chess:

Big Business does not hold itself out as a
sacred cow whose actions or ethics are
not subject to scrutiny or valid criticism.

But in making valuejudgments of the

"rightness" or "wrongness" of business,
I question whether isolated instances are
definitivecriteria. .

Critical judgments should be made in
perspective with the phenomenal growth
of our national economy since the end of

' World War II; a period during which our

gross national product more than tripled '
from $208.5-billion to approximately
$740-billion last year.

This growthhas resulted from a continuous
effort on the part of the business com-
munity to respond both to society's
demands, and its needs. On the one hand,
the constant demand for product
improvement leads to better design and
greater performance through advances in
technology. Similarly, society's needs
prompt extensive research for the
development of completelynew products
——-which create the additional profit-
making opportunities essential for the
nation's economic growth—while
satisfying a social purpose.

The measles vaccine developed at Dow is
an example. The benefitsto society from
planned inoculation programs multiply

in astounding ‘geometric proportions. Not
only can thetotal incidence of measles

be cut substantially, but also a far lesser
number will suffer the crippling mental
defects which before destined many to a
life of perpetual care in institutions.
Human lives are being saved, their useful _
purposefulnessunimpaired, while millions
of dollars are freed for reallocation ,
to other uses. ’ I‘

The focus on profit—making products to
serve definable social needs reflects the
times just as the community's mores
always affect standards of ethics. In this
less-than-perfect society in which we live,
the ranks of business, and government,
and education, and virtually every other
segment of the community, unfortunately
harbor those who cheat and scheme to
gain their personal ends. It's probably
rather remarkable that our times have not
produced more Billie Sol Estes and Bobby .
Bakers. But usually they are found out in
short order. Neither I, nor any other
responsible businessman, condone their
actions. Certainly their conduct cannot be

' regarded as typifying business any more
than the activities of the S.D.S. on various A

campuses speak for the majority segment
of the student body.

Equally, an inquiry into press— 
sensationalized episodes of bribery. ‘:
collusion, kickbacks and callgirls probably '
will reveal involvement of the same kinds ..
of cheaters and schemers looking for a “‘
fast dollar._ No company that I know .
condones this conduct. It simply does not _
represent the ethics of business, any more 
than does industrial espionage. Frankly, I ‘ E-5;‘
think its significance has been
quite exaggerated.

What it all adds up to is that most ,
business enterprises, under the strict ' 
discipline of our competitive profit—making
system, constantly are providing 1.
improved products and better service. In 5‘
doing so they mirror the community——of
which they are an integral part—both in .
the advances made, and in their standards
of performance. In the course of this, '
mistakes, as distinguished from unethical
practices, occur. I suppose that those
who make ‘them are no less reluctantsto
‘admit their mistakes, or to sustain public
criticism, than people in other

walks of life.

I am ‘not acquainted with all the facts
surrounding General Motors’ issue with
Ralph Nader, but it is a matter of record
that James Roche, then President of GM,
made a public apology on this matter L 
before the Senate's Investigating _Com- if
mittee.

As regards Rachel Carson and

insecticides, I will say that my own
company had done research on the
toxicology of insecticides long before the
Food & Drug Administration voiced any
concern in this subject. Research was not
forced by Miss Carson's work. The -
chemical control of agricultural pests
certainly has a direct bearing on the very
critical question of world food supply.
Such control measures, coupled with I
applied research by.agronomists improving
cropyields, constantly are increasing

food supplies to meet expanding
population needs.

I feel, therefore, that while your question

as to ”What’s Right About Big

Business" focuses on its conduct, rather

than its accomplishments, real objectivity

requires that both be weighed in balance.

On this broad scale, then, business is ' :
pace setting ‘the times in accordance with

the community's needs and the ground

rules of its environment.
