Performance educates on abuse

Tegan Hanlon
For The Pitt News

“Jenna” stood in front of the mi’cro—
phone, her eyes glued to the ground.
She explained to the audience that her
boyfriend often forces her to have sex.

She asks him if there is anything else
that they can do when they are together
-— he’s not interested in anything else.
Jenna has been banned from spending
time with her male friends. She is in
denial that she is being raped. I _

Jenna, played by Pitt juniorJul a Ru-
bin, is one of the characters‘-in  pro-
gram “Words Not Spoken,” presented
by the Hillel Jewish University-Center
last night in the William Pitt Union As-
sembly Room. 1

During the performance, student ac- '

tors from various universities presented
ﬁve monologues each representing a dif-

ferent type of abuse —- including sexual,
physical, verbal and emotional ~—_— from
the viewpoints of both the abused and

The presenters said the purpose of _

the production was to increase aware-
ness of abuse and to discuss the prob-

lems and relevance of issues dealing with
dating violence and abuse.

“Only 50 percent of dating abuse vic-

those who do report, 88 percent tell a

director of “Words Not Spoken..”
Rubin discussed why she believes
many victims do not speak up.
“People who are abused are often
ashamed, and to make matters worse,
if they speak‘ up, their friends tend to
blame them for putting themselves
in that situation and not leaving the

abuser,” she said. “We forget to ask not

only, ‘Whyare you with him/her?’ but,
‘Why does he/she abuse?’ It’s a two-way
street.” ,
“I hope the audience learned what
the indicators of abusive behavior are
and good techniques inorder to resolve
the issues,” senior cast member and Pitt

Banner to
honor Rutgers
player

Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor

Pitt will honor a Rutgers football player before
the two football teams square off at Heinz Field
this Saturday. . . , . T

The Pitt Athletic Department made a banner
for Rutgers defensive lineman.Eric LeGrand,
who was paralyzed below the neck while trying
to make a play during the Scarlet Knights’ game
against Army on Saturday.

An Athletic Department spokeswoman was
not surelastnight when the banner, which reads
“Pitt is pulling for Eric LeGrand,” will go on dis-
play. It will appear ﬁrst in the Petersen Events
Center, then at the William Pitt Union before
moving near the student section at Heinz Field
for Saturday’s game. ‘

Members of the Pitt community are encour-

aged to sign the banner.

“This was a very, very unfortunate injury,”
Pitt head coach Dave Wannstedt said. “I corre-
sponded with [Rutgers coach] Greg Schiano and
let him know that, ﬁnm our team and players,
our thoughts and prayers are with Eric.” ﬂ

Student Health helps Pitt’s sex rankings

Ryan Shaughnessy
For The Pitt News

Pitt’s national prestige has risen, and
even a condom company thinks so.

Trojan Brand Condoms released its
2010 Sexual Health Report Card last
week. The study ranked Pitt the 21st
most sexually healthy school out of 141
universities tested in the country. Penn
State and WVU ranked 14th and 15th in
the study, respectively.

Pitt skyrocketed up the ranks from
last year’s study, in which Trojan ranked

nationwide. 5

Trojan has released the study each
year for the past five years.‘ "

5 “We want to inspire action, get people
to realize that sexual health on campus is
critical and that there are things every-
one can doto help improve their sexual
health,” Bruce Tetreault, group product
manager at Trojan, said in a press re-
lease. 4 ‘

The research ﬁrm Sperling’s BestPlac-
es conducted the study, which analyzed
data from student health centers to rank
schools.

Factors like the number of students
withan STD, HIV or unplanned pregnan-

V cies were not included in this study.

Bert Sperling, president of Sperling’s
BestPlaces, explained the methodology
of the study. _ A" _

“The study did not evaluate schools
for their level of sexual activity or sexual
health in regards to STDs,” Sperling said.
“The study evaluated the campuses that
are doing the best job of communicat-
ing with students so that they can make
their own decisions regarding sexual
health.” _ , .

Student Health could not provide sta-

tistics about on-campus STD rates or

unplanned pregnancy rates but was able

to provide national statistics.
According to the Center for Disease

Control, there are about 19 million new

STD infections each year — almost half of
them among young people 15 to 24 years
of age — Dr. Elizabeth Wettick, director
of Pitt’s Student Health Service, said.
The key reason behind Pitt’s jump in
the rankings might be improvements
made by the University’s Student Health
Service. Sperling said this is because

Study uses health center information

Pitt’s Student Health Service efforts helped Pitt’s ranking rise in study ‘

Trojan 4 2

many of the 12 criteria reﬂect resources
and testing made available by the Student
Health Service.

In nine out of 12 categories, Pitt re-
ceived A or B grades, with C beingthe
lowest grade possible.

Pitt scored a 10 out of10 on HIV test-
ing and availability of sexual-assault
programs. It receivediA grades in those
categories, Sperling said.

Wettick described the most popular v

resources available for Pitt students
through Student Health that may have
helped in the rankings. ’

PantherWELL is a relatively new pro-
gram on campus, Wettick said.

Its most popular program is a “broad
overview of STDs and STD prevention,”
which includes discussion of types of
STDs, abstinence, correct condom use
and STD testing. ‘

In addition, she said Student Health’s

health educator provides many services,
including a program called “Girl Talk,”
a candid discussion about birth control
methods.

The health educator is also available
for individual appointments with students
who seek more information about birth
control options or STD prevention, or for
a rapid oral HIV test. .

The study only included schools from
various athletic conferences and many
of the universities evaluated were large
state schools. However, Sperling assured
that the study is reflective of the nation’s
student base. T

“Although there are over 2,000 insti-
tutions and universities in the country,
schools in our study covered over 30 per-
cent of all undergraduates in the country,”
Sperling said. “Schools were chosen based

l_ on their ‘maximum’ impact.”

Columbia ranked first, and Brigham
Young and University of Idaho were last
to finish in the rankings this year.

To give perspective of the Trojan rank-
ings, both WVU and PSU arehigher up on
the Princeton Review’s party rankings
than Pitt.

Sperling said even the smallest changes
can go a long way and differences between
14 and-21 in the rankings are trivial.

“Don’t worry,” Sperling said. “21st is
really, really good. You’re doing a lot of

’ things right.”

Here are "the 12 criteria used in the
study:

1. Health center hours of operation

A p 2. Availability of patient drop—in vs.

appointment only

3. Availability of separate sexual aware-
ness programs‘ 

4. Contraceptive availability and cost
5. Condom availability and cost

6. HIV testing, cost and locality (on vs.
off campus) '

7. Other STI testing, cost and locality
(on vs. off campus) .

'8. Availability of anonymous advice via

’ grams

Many abuse victims stay silent

Production teaches students houg to increase communication between victims and friends

Words 4 1

“The program was really helpful,”
sophomore Jordan Pipkin said. “It really
opened my eyes to a broader deﬁnition
of dating abuse and rape.”

After the monologues, about 50 audi-
ence members broke into small groups
to simulate confronting a friend who had
been a victim of abuse.

They practiced offering tips to help.
the abused victim.

“You need to listen without judging
and share your concerns with the per-
son,” Matza—Haughton said. “Let the
victim know that the abuse is not his
or her fault.”  .

Others involved with the production
said that communication is necessary to
protect victims from abuse. -

“Silence is the enemy, and people in
these situations are not alone. There
are resources out there, there is help,”
said senior Timothy Craft, from Rainbow
Alliance. The group was a co-sponsor of
the event. -

The program featured a cast of four
students from Pitt —— seniors Cornick
and Karthik Dwarki and juniors Becca
Stern and Rubin, as well as Olivia Payne, _

Soda pop won’t stop,
even if banned

Soda pop gets a bad reputation, admittedly for
good reasons. ’N Sync went so far as to call it
“dirty” pop, and apparently, baby, you can’t stop
lildng that dirty pop. Oh wait, wrong pop.
But1et’smakelike]ustinTimberlake and set’N
Sync aside, because NewYorkCityMayor Michael
Bloombergmightbetakingitalittle toofarintry-

ingtobanNewYorl6sSupp1ementalNutritionAs-  “

sistance Program (SNAP) users ﬁ‘om buyingpop
and other sugary drinkswith their food stamps,
according to The NewYork Times. .

Currently, the only items that cannotbe pur-
chased with food stamps are alcohol and tobacco
products. C

To be fair, like these products, pop provides
virtually no nutritional beneﬁt. But the same is
true of a lot of foods at supermarkets.

We feel this new ban on sugary beverages
unfairly targets food-stamp recipients as making
unhealthy choices, even though everyone could

’ beneﬁt from drinking fewer Pepsis.

The New York Times reports that “health
advocates make it clear that they would like to
improve everybody’s diet, not just that of food-
stamp recipients, through measures like ataxon
sugar-sweetened beverages.”

Ifpop is really on the samelevelas alcohol and
tobacco products, thentaxingseerns likethe next

logical move for decreasing its consumption, not
banning it from SNAP purchases.
But even taxing might not help decrease the
use of such an inexpensive product.
Forcing _people to be healthy actually turns
out to be pretty hard. P ‘
Anddespitethe correlalionbetween increased
 " _ f _ tion and increased obesity rates,
pop is not solely responsible for weight gain.
So howmanythings do we havetotaxorban

from food-stamp programs before ‘Americans ‘

arehealthy? 1

It’s also important to note that the purpose
of the food-stamp program was to “enlarge the
choices of poor and hungry people, rather than
to limit them to the most nutritious items,” The
New York Times 

Mayor Bloomberg’s effortto ban pop is amild
example of the government attemptingto control
human behavior.

When it comes down to it, we’re pretty sure
mostpeople know that regular pop drinking is
not conducive to good health, yet they continue
to drink it anyway. Consumers should have the
optionto do that, and they should deﬁnitely have

==::*?tl'fé option to drink pop in moderation.

Because you know more than

Government should take lessons from Mom about spending:

Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

You are 4 and have a sassy attitude and a knack
for googling. You also have a fear of monsters
under the bed. , ‘

A likely course of action for you would be to
storm up to your mom waving some printout
fromawebsite foramonster-catching machine,
demanding thatyou need the protection offered
by the device.

But mother knows best. A machine would
not decrease the frequency of monster attacks
in your room -— monsters are notoriously dif-
ﬁcult to catch. Plus, the money she saves ﬁ‘om
not buying what is essenﬁally just a giant box
with blinking lights can now go toward a book
explaininghow monsters are notrealand13boxes
of Fruit Gushers. ~

Now replace your mother with government,
the 4-year-old version of yourselfwith various
advocacy and citizens’ groups, and the monsters
with crime, obesity and other social ills and you

. have a situation analogous to today, with one

exception: Mother buys you the monster ma-
chine, and instead of Gushers, we get big boxes
ofblinking lights.

Forthosewholosttrackofthis analogy awhile
ago, I am saying that the government puts too
many resources towardthings thatonlymakeus
feel safer, healthierorbetter, butdon’tact11allydo'
anything to improve our daily life.

One example of this is politically placed four-
way stop signs. Before you roll your eyes at the
idiocy of complainingaboutstop-sign conspira-
cies, I’ll admit that the problem is a lot smaller
than say, terrorism. But it exempliﬁes my point
very clearly "

To clarify, by politically placed stop signs, I
mean the urmecessary four—way stop signs lo-
cated in many residential neighborhoods that
have nothing to do with trafﬁc control and are
only meantto slow drivers—the signs on rarely
traveled roadsthatonlyseemtotestyourpatience
and your ability to follow the law. Many of these
signs are the result of mothers and‘neighborhood-
advocacy groups lobbying for signs to protect
littlejoey andjulia Ann. Local governments, not
wanting to urmecessarily anger people, often
capitulate.

Unfortunately, four-way stop signs like this
are no more effective than monster—catching
machines. They don’t reduce accidents orprotect
Joey. In fact, they often make it more dangerous
forhirn.AsnotedbyMartinBrethertonatarecent

Instiurte of 'I‘ransportation Engineers meeting,
drivers often don’t feel obligated to stop at these
stop signs,- and when they do, they often resort
to wild acceleration and braking to compensate
for stopping. These intersections become less
safe, and the admittedly small cost of a stop sign
is needlessly added to the city’s budget.

The quick moral of this story is that the signs
make mothers feel greatbut actually makethings
worse.pIt is a case where what we want: makes
us worse off. In personal issues, this is ﬁne ‘—
spend your afternoon drinking lead milkshakes
if itmakes you happy.- But at higher levels, the
policies should be more data-driven. This story
is repeated very often in other policy areas.

- Concerned about crime? Ifa 2008 British
survey of its citizens is any indication, residents of
the United Kingdomare concerned, eventhough
crime rates have been dropping for more than
10 years. The Conservative and Labour parties,
therefore, haveto out-doeachotherand advocate
stronger, more expensive positions on crime to
not appear weak. As of 2008, this had pushed
crime spending to 2.5 percent of the country’s
GDP, anevengreaterpercentagethanthe United
States’.

But consideringthe actual crime rate and the ’

budget situation the country faces, this spend-.

ing is increasingly unjustiﬁable. Determining

spending based on the perception of crime is
wasteful, just as spending based on the percep-
tion of monsters is.

' Finally, we havelall heard the stories about
schools pulling chocolate milk from cafeterias
and increasing the intensity of gym classes to

combat childhood obesity. The ideais that these ‘
actions,whichlimitchoiceandcutintoacademic -
timaarejustiﬁablebecausetheywilltiimchildren ‘

into beautiful, ﬁt GapKids models.

Too badthese programs don’twork either. As
Dr. Leann Birch points out in her recentwork on
childhood obesity, childhood weight problems
stemmore fromthe hometlranfrom school. Yet
this doesn’t seemto be stoppingthe onslaughtfof
school programs —we allfeelbetrerwhenwe at"
least appear to improve the situation.

So ifyou are scared of monsters, fatkids, crazy
drivers orphantom crime butyou don’twantto do
anythingto actually improve circumstances ——or
wouldlike to spendwaytoo much money on it —
then be consoled that governments everywhere
are on your side. I, however, do not sleep any more
soundly knowing of the wasted spending.

Then again, that couldbe the monster under
my bed.

Smashing Pumpkins, take note: At least
one other band is bold enough to claim
a fruit as its title. _.
Pomegranates, a Cincinnati-based act
of college-aged men, adapted the name
because it was “the idea that -was least
embarrassing” at the time, according to
drummer Jacob Merritt. _
“Pomegranates havea mythology and
a cleansing process. The imagery fit our
music,” Merritt said. .
Pomegranates’ music, which Merritt
described as dreamy pop, reflects the
tastes of the individual band members,

» with heavy inﬂuence from groups like

Pink Floyd and the Talking Heads.
Merritt and vocalist, guitarist and
keyboard player Isaac Karns formed
Pomegranates in 2007. As their old band
separated, Merritt and Karns continued
playing together, recruiting another vo-
calist and guitar player, Joey Cook. The
group’s first recorded work, the EP Two
Eyes came out four months later. Soon,
the band was signed to Lujo Records.
By the time their first album, Every-

thing is Alive, debuted in 2008, the mem- .

bers had settled into a new lifestyle, and
a lineup change had brought vocalist and
guitar player Daniel Lyon to the band.
Lyon said he’d been involved in several
other groups at the time, but the Pome-
granates were refreshingly dedicated.

“In January I decided to come down
again and start writing with them after
a falling out with the other players [in
other bands] ,” Lyon said. “This is defi-
nitely a lot more serious than any other
project.”

Merritt has been involved with the
music scene since he began playing in

Courtesy Kerry Davis

high school, ﬁnding pleasure in music
composition.

“I like the idea of creating something
that other people appreciate and some-
how makes their lives better one way or
another,” Merritt said.

Currently on the road, the band are
releasing a third album, One of Us, at

I the end of October. The album makes

frequent references to relationships back
home.

1 “I think with this last album, everyone
felt like it was mostly personal experi-
ence,” Lyon said. “I think a lot of beliefs

.come into this. I think there’s, quite a

number of love songs as a result of us
having serious girlfriends.”

Karns, a member of the Pomegranates
since its inception, noted that the band’s
albums have become less story-based.

“On our last album [Euerybozy Come
Out], we had a few songs we released we

_ could tie togetherpwith a narrative,” he

said. “In some ways it was easier to write

In 1984, Joel and Ethan Coen made their
directorial debuts with “Blood Simple,” a
dark-comedy thriller awash with adultery,
murder. and betrayal.

Twenty-five years later, acclaimed Chi-
nese director Zhang Yimou has remade it,
transporting-the story from a small Texas
town to the deserts of northern China.

The plot of “A Woman, a Gun and a
Noodle Shop” —— staying true to its Eng-
lish title — is simple. A man suspects his
wife is having an affair with an employee
and hires someone to kill the adulterous
‘couple. But murder never remains simple.
Complications arise when the hired hitman
realizes an opportunity for ﬁnancial gain
by eliminating the boss instead.

Director Zhang Yimou made his name
with films like “House of Flying Daggers,”
“Hero” and “Raise the Red Lantern.” Theg
tackle the theme of adversity faced by peo-
ple living in rural areas of China, often
feature a strong female lead and dazzle
audiences with rich color palettes.

Despite being accustomed to the Chi-

' nese slapstick cinematic style, I found

myself unable to connect with this movie"?

Compared to the obvious ominous and dan- -

gerous tones of the Coen Brothers’ ver-
sion, the elements of “Noodle Shop” were
too outlandish. I left after the 95-minute
movie, simply hungry for a bowl of pulled
noodles and with the desire to see the origi-
nal “Blood Simple.”

‘Shop’ lacks kung fu

Noodle 4 7

This is not to say that the movie deserves
a bad review. It has been extremely well-
received at international ﬁlm festivals and
in its limited opening in the United States.
But, my fellow college-aged classmates --
especially those with no particular interest
in or knowledge of China — might get more
out of “Blood Simple.” : ,

“A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop”

might wow audiences with contrasting

' bright costumes and sweeping panoramas

of the desert at the rarely seen western_

end of the Great Wall, but the subtleties of
Zhang’s deft directorial hand might be lost.
Additionally, although many Chinese ﬁlms
utilize martial arts to engage foreign audi-
ences, there is an obvious lack of kung fu in
this movie. Death is quickly bestowed upon
victims by ﬁrearm instead of by drawn out,-

,.cho"re:ographed sword ﬁghts.

If you would still like to take a chance

Band ripens songwriting

Group forgoes extensive narratives for chronicles.” of romance

Pomegranates 4 7
ﬁt songs to the narrative.”

The Pomegranates’ third album, how-
ever, was not conceived with a blueprint
of any sort. Though Karns sees the album
as painting a clear portrait, any narrative
listeners might infer is unintentional.

K “As far as writing, that was a big dif-
ference,” he said. _“We didn’t have a des-
tination point with the new one. We just
wrote. Last time we had a start and a
ﬁnish and we ﬁlled in the blanks.”

Ever industrious, the band is already
thinking about producing another al-
bum.

“We’ve written a song that we have
yet to record and release, but we play
at shows, that we’re happy with,” Karns
said. “I think We’re all excited to write
again. I think we’re always trying to write
songs and not -take long of a break. We
may not use all the songs, but it keeps

us going.” ‘ .

When their tour_ ends, the members
of Pomegranates will all return to day
jobs in cafés and restaurants. Most of
the members live in Ohio, with the excep-
tion of guitarist Joey Cook, who lives in
Northern Kentucky.

“When we’re home between extended
touring we have to work really hard,”
Karns said. “When on the road it’s fun and
rewarding, but it’s still hard work.”

Band life for Karns is “halfway between
a career and a hobby” — it doesn’t pay
the bills by itself. Karns has envisioned
working on a farm or in a bookstore but
doesn’t see these as “lucrative choices”
that could ever replace music. ’

“I’m happy to do something that I love
and share it with people even if it is hard
work and not the best money,” Karns said.
“I think we all agree it’s worth it».”I

 een Postseaon hopes alive

 

r ssel I Staff Phgrp

Pitt sophomore Hayley Neal (N o. 29) and the Panthers split two games over the weekend against Georgetown and Villanova.

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt Women’s soccer team needed to win at
least one game thisweekendto remainin conten-
tion for a berth in the Big East tournament. 1 7
Luckily, they did. _
The Panthers fell 1-0 to Georgetown on Friday, -
but with their backsagainst thewall against Vil-
lanova on Sunday, they capitalized on the scoring

opportunities they’ve struggled to take advantage :

of all season, defeating the Wildcats 3-0.

The top-ﬁve teams in the American and
National divisions each advance to the Big East
tournament. Right now, the Panthers are in last
place, three points behind St. John’s and four
points behind Syracuse. '

Pitt will have a chance to make up ground
thisweekendastheteam ends its regularseason
against Providence on Oct. 22 and Connecticut
on Oct. 24 at Founder’s‘ Field. Pitt head coach

Sue-Moychinsaidthe Panthers needtowinboth '

gamesand need several other teams to lose in
orderto earn aberth inthe tournament.

Chin said Pitt needs to bestrongintlieback,
the way the team played over the weekend, in
orderto earnthe victories. It’s importantforthe
Panthers to keep the opposing team infront of
them, she said.‘

“We just needtoﬁnish our chances. Ifwe can
getanearlystartthewaywe didagainstvillanowm,
thatwillbe bigfor us,” Chin said. “We’relool<ing

The girls know what we have to do, so its going

The Panthers registered only one shot on goal as
Georgetown held them scoreless and picked up

In the 37”‘ minute, Kailey Blain scored her
ﬁrst goal ofthe season, which ended up beingthe
gamewinnerfor the Hoyas.AfteraPittturnover,
Blain took an off—balance shot, shooting the ball
past Pitt goalkeeper Morie Kephart into the top-
left comer of the net. -

The Hoyas heldthe Pantherswithoutashotin
the ﬁrst halfwhile registering six of their own.

“I thoughtwe were alittle tentative intheﬁrst
half,” Chin said. “We gave themalittle too much
time and space on the ball.” I

In the second half, however, Pitt increased ’

its intensity on the offensive end, shooting the
ball nine times to Georgetown’s three. Chin said
the Panthers did a better job of pressing the

M Hoyas on the ball and on the attack, especially

off turnovers.

“Wewereve1yaggt'essiveatthegoalandcre~ ‘

ated scoring opportunities in the second half,”
Chin said, “I wishwewouldhaveplayed thatway
in the ﬁrst, because I think the outcome would
have been different”

Hayley Neal had the only shot on goal for s

Pitt in the game. In the 51?‘ minute, she ﬁred a
shotatGeorgetown goalkeeperjackie Desjardin,
-but Desjardin stopped the ball in the center of
the box. ’ '

Desjardin earned her sixth shutout of the
season. Kephart made one save and allowed one

goal.

Pitt's Ashley Cuba said the Panthers played
well on Friday but just couldn’t pull out the vic-
tory. .

The Panthers came out ﬁring against Villanova,
scoring twice in the ﬁrst halfas they defeated
the Wildcats 3-o. ’

Three minutes into the game, Neal put the
Panthers ahead. Following a Carroll corner kick,
Morgan Sharickgatheredtheballandtookashot,

save. Neal collected the ball and after her ﬁrst
shot was knocked away, she scored on her own
rebound into the near-side corner.

“We started out very strongagainstVillano—
Va,” Chin said. “We were able to get that early
goal, whichwas huge, and then we continued to
put pressure on and got another goal.”

Teams the

do without

Tonyjovenitti
Sports Editor

 

Lastweek, Icounted downthe loteamsthatshould
join the Big East; But in order for that to happen,
the BigEastwould needto get rid of certain teams’
in basketball

There are already 16 basketball schools, and
even that is too much. ‘

ESPN Radio 101.3 in Dallas reported over the
weekend that'FCUwas invited to the BigEast. I’rn
not sure if that’s a rumor or not, but how could
the Big East invite TCU football and not add the
Horned Frogs in basketball?

Yes, itwouldbe extremely rudeto simply kick
outabasketballteam. Lastweek, I suggested hav-
ing a Survivor season and eliminating the two
last—place teams after the regular season. Or the

conference could strike a deal with the MAC or V
' Conference USA, and the two worst teams could

be relegated down to a so-called mid-major con-
ference. V

Butallthatwould be too complicated. So this
week, I give you the 10 teams the Big East should
kick out.

The teams at thetop ofthe listarethe most
valuable to the conference, so No. 10 absolutely

. cannotbekickedout. No.1shouldhavebeenkicked

for any conference.

6. Marquette. Marquette doesn’t have as
much history in the Big East as Villanova and
Georgetown, but the Golden Eagles do have a
rich_historyinbasketball. They won tl1eNaﬁonal
Championshipin1977 and have appearedinthfee
Final Fours, inc1uding2003 whentheybeat Pittin

5. St._]ohn’s. St. _]ohn’s basketball has been
awful for years. Since 2003, the Red Storm are
83-118. But they won the Big East tournament
in 2000, and they have a lot of history in New

ances. Itwouldbetoughto kick outaschoolwith
that much basketball history. But in all honesty,
the Red Storm’ aren’t bringing much to the table
anymore. *

4. Providence. It would be a shame to kick
Providence out of the Big East when it is on the
cusp of success. TheFriars areafoundingmember
of the conference and have some decent history,
but not nearlyas much as St.Johns. And honestly,
how important is the Rhode Island market?

3. Seton Hall. The Pirates are much like St.

  

John’ . They have a lot of basketball history, but
not as much as the Red Storm. The Pirates have
a lot of difficulty selling out Nevvark’s Prudential
Center, even with the upper levels closed off. Rut-

‘ gers is already giving the Big East the Newjersey

markeggand the Scarlet Knights have a much big-
gerhabase. — .

2. DePaul. DePaulhas two Final Four appear-
ances, but one was in 1943, prior to the modern
Tournament. But over the past six years, the Blue
Demons are a dismal 37-65 in the Big East Con-
ference. Yes, the conference needs a team that
everybodycanbeatup on, butDePaul is just abit
ridiculous. The Blue Demons are not livingup to
Big East standards since joining the conference
in 2005. ‘

1. DePauL Yes, the Blue Demons are on this
list twice. They are that bad. And seriously, who
cares about DePaul basketball? DePaul is a great
university, but itisbringing absolutely nothingto
the BigEast. Somewould argue t.’natDePaulbrings
the Chicago market, but Nolre Dame already does
that. I’dtakeanawﬁ1lTCUbasketballteamoveran
awful DePaul team if it means thatTCUwillbring

namen ”

The Panthers had several other chances to
score, includingachristina Nicassio shotthat hit
off me crossbarjust minutes after Pitt’s ﬁrst goal.
After the first half, Pitt out-shot Villanova 12-5.

Pitt ended the game with a 21-9 shot advan-
tage, including an 8-4 shots-on-goal advantage.
The Panthers also led in comer kicks, 6-2.

Kephart made four saves and recorded her
fourth shutout of the season and ninth of her

career. Cuba scored her sixth goal of the season
and the 13”‘ of her career. She’s now fourth on
Pitt’s all-time scoring list in just her sophomore
season. .
Chin said thewinwas crucial to keeping Pitt’s
Big Easttournament hopes alive. .
The Pantherswillhead into their last regular
season games hoping to play like they did on
