Friends.

 

$419.15 was the amount collected
from the students and friends of the
University as a Thanksgiving gift for
Harry Shof, a former Pitt student and
n-ow a patient in the West Penn hos-
pital.

\

Under the supervision of ‘Mr. Yoder,
chairman of the Shof fund, tagging be-
gan Wednesday afternoon on the
campus. Many students remained in
.room 107 Thaw hall to help string the
tags which might be ready for the
Thanksgiving game. At 6 p. m. 3,500
tags were left to be strung, but they
were soon made a prey of William
Shapiro, a freshman, who volunteered
his services at home until the wee
hours. --

At 12:30. a. in. Thursday many
Schof taggers appeared on Forbes
ﬁeld and were given sealed boxes to

Harry Schoff is well remembered by’

the students as being the only man
who scored a touchdown against W.

THEODORE M. BARBER

 

. DIES AT HOSPITAL

Was One of Earliest Professors
of Latin in Old Western Uni-

 

versity of Pennsylvania.

 

Theodore M. Barber, formerly a.
professor in the old Western Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania, died on the ev-
ening of November 25 at St. Francis
Hospital, Pittsburgh, .Pa. Professor
Barber was appointed to the chair of
Latin in 1870, a year after graduating
at Dartmouth.

-Coming to the University at a time
when classical learning did not prove
attractive to the average student, he
brought to his teaching such thor-
oughness of method and strict disci-
pline that the. study seemed _to have
new, life and many of those among
the student body, who were ambi-
tious to learn, found that no more

proﬁtable or instructive courses were

given in the U-niversity than those of
Professor Barber.

At a meeting of the sophomore class
held Monday in room 105 Thaw, the
president was instructed to- draw up
_a petition to be presented to the
student senate asking them to rescind

heir action in taking the money due
the sophomore class from the sale of

. President Hill called the meeting t-o

on the matter of certain freshmen dis-
obeying the freshmen rules. '

After this matter was disposed of
the question of the cap money was

Hill Illl. BllAbllEAll

“Uncle John”, Alfred Brashear,
-Pittls-gwst-“noted Alumnus, and-‘narn-
ed by l- the Governor of his state as
Pennsylvania’s most eminent citizen,
was paid a tribute by more than 1,000
citizens at monster banquet in Mem-
orial hall, in celebration of his sev-
enty-ﬁfth anniversary last Wednesday
night.

Twice during the evening Pitt con-
quered. Almost riotous cheering oc-
curred when Mr. Baird’s poem “A
Rose for Every Year” was recited by
a Pitt student, during which tin1e‘the
Phoebe Brashear club responded to a
gift of 75 roses.‘ And on another oc-
casion when Dr. George H. Clapp,
president of the board of trustees of
the University of Pittsburgh, read a
set of resolutions adopted by the trus-
tees. He announced rthat on Pitt
charter day, February 23, the Univer-
sity proposes to confer upon Dr. Bra-
shear. the degree of doctor of laws.

The masque and pageant given in
honor of Mr. Brashear was a master-
piece, those taking ‘part acquitting
themselves. in a most praisewonthy
manner. Following the masque there
was a pageant of the organizations
‘present which included" more than
thirty clubs and societies in, which
“Uncle John” is a member. This pag-
eant was under the direction of a
committee of the University of Pitts-
burgh, in which George ’M.. P. Baird
and Dr. Tyson ﬁgured preeminently.

T-he Phoebe Brashear club, repre-

 

Dr. Brashear on the stage and each
member deposited an American

AMENDMENTS P A S S E D.

 

The Student Senate of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh have donated
themselves Christmas presents in the
form of a gold pin for services ren-
deredto their fellow coherts during
the current year. This ‘was the de-

, cree passed by the members of Pitt’s

‘ruling body, the Senate, at a regular
meeting Monday morning. L

“The pin will be an-expression of
thanks, and the only expression the
senators will get,” was the sentiment
of one of the senators in fav or of the
adoption of the insignia.

The next action of the Senate was
the clearing up of the State band

ing Pitt’s alma mater. While both
the Pitt and State bands were march-

sented by 75 members, marched past’

ing on the ﬁeld displaying much
“Pep” and trying to drown each other
in noise State was playing Pitt’s alma
mater. This was not noticed by the
Pitt student body until one of the
members halted the band by saying,
“Stop, they are playing our Alma
Mater”. It was later understood that
there was an ill feeling existing in the
State camp. The action of the Senate
was to rectify the matter to the stu-
dent body of State and explain the

was deeper-seated, and lies in the fact
that there was lack of prearrange-

the person of Dr. Francis (J. Holder,
we shall look to see a rise on the part
of the student, band. propo-rtional to
the advance on the.MusicalTc1ubs dur-

W T it personally? We
are certain that a disgracefully large
percentage of them do not. This is
something for which no Pitt man or
woman can be held blameless. : The
‘words are printed on innumerable oc-
casions, and are contained in’ the
student handbook, whilethe mu-sic is
set to the ‘well-known hymn -tune. of
the Austrian national anthem. We
have heard the complaint that this
tune is life-less and, uninspiring. We
do not agree. An Alma !M.ate%r should
be set to stately -and digniﬁed melody,
and this anthem has those qualities,
at the same time that it does not
lack, virility. It m-aybe a good thing
for a new tune, original with Pitt
composer, is something that event-
ually should come. but until that time,
the “Austrian Hymn” is our Alma
Mater, and we must give it proper
respect.

In this...-connection, the tendency to
substitute a lighter song, like “Hail
to Pi-tTt”T for,-rthe Alma Mater, i. e.-, by
st-anding and uncovering for it, is to
be heartily discouraged. .. George
Kirk, who wrote the words -of “Hail
to Pitt”, to the _.music of ‘Lester M.
Taylor,‘ says that this inclination is
entirely foreign to the original pur-
pose ofits authors; It is a football
song, pure and simple, like Yal-e’s
“Boo1a” or the “On Wisconsin” of the
North, -and shouldne-ver be elevated
to the position of A
which our Alma Mater should be
treated. And the same applies to the
new “Cheer Song”. T’ 3 r A

in. almost endless controversies,
largely with the central powers, over

Allies is largely a re-ﬂection of this
sentiment, ‘that Germany and Austria,’

T by their conduct. ‘of the war, have for-

feited whatever -claim they may have

of the administratiorn has _ been

fundamentally, the only right or pos-

sible one, viz.,, that the lives and
property of neutrals are‘ quite as
thoroughly to. be respected. in war as
in peace. "Whether the practice of our
government has been entirely effective
is open to some question.’ But the

Last week the social whirl was set
a going by the Spirit of Thanksgiv-

merrymakings. To have a party or
to go to one three times daily for the

au fait, and many we-re the parties.
There -were those parties to see the
game, a half dozen or more fellows
deciding they’d sit together to vet-
ness State’s downfall and bring their

after -the game, at the various frater-
nities, all‘ of which kept openhou‘se
to the membegs and their friends at
theschenley and Fort Pitt where the
crowds‘ were of the gayest and every-
body entered into the spirit of the
;fun for the season's sake, and of the
various theaters.‘ “The. Follies”. seem-
'ed to be the lode star of Thespian art
and thither went many to see the hit
of the season. T We are all singing

“Hello Frisco” this week.

Monday, December 6th the Nixon

“Chalky” Wiliamson led his world-
beating aggregation of gridiron stars
through their ﬁnal test of the season
on Thanksgiving Day against the
mighty foe hailing from Penn State,
and the outcome, expressed in a 20-to-
0 victory over the Center Countians,
affords ample evidence that Coach

It was a remarkable affair to mark
the close of such a glorious season.
Right from the outset Pitt was put to
a severe test. of its staying qualities
when a fumble of the kickoﬁ gave
State the ball on the Gold and Blue
seven’-yard line. .Warner’s gladiators
responded with the desired effect,

, holding the visitors for downs.with

little advancement. It surely was a
splendid bit of defensive play on

Pitt’s part.

Williamson Shines ,

State, displaying more skill than
any of Pitt’s former opponents of the
year, Pennsylvania and Washington
but a
slight -change in Pitt’s attack worked
remarkably well, and the Blue and
VVhite. determined as they were,
could not withstand the furious on-
slaught. Captain Williamson was at
half, and in his old post at quarter
was one promising youngster. This
star’s name is Eric Meadows, and it

_ is because of his splendid judgment

th-at Coach Warner's eleventh hour
shift in the lineup met with such ap-
proval _after thestruggle. On several

 occasions Meadows contributed spec-

tacular work at breaking up State’s

open game and while calling signals

seemed to overlook no opportunity.
Williamson, relieved of much re-

sponsibility in this new arrangement,

was able to distinguish himself to
better advantage. His running ith

P the ball could not be excelled, w. ile

-his punting stood out as one of the
«chief features of the combat. His
boots were all good for long distan-
ces and while he had a worthy nival
in Clarke, his ki.ck'i:ng was the best
done by Pitt in any game this year.
’ Hastings Amasses Points
Hastings, of course, cannot beds-
nied his share in any conﬂict, and
those who have watched the former
Kiski phenom all season were not
surprised at his sensational playing.
His ﬁrst successful placement kick of
the season was registered early in

the tussle and that score broke the

ice. Later on he annexed the two

rtouchdowns and kicked both goals,
«amassing in all a total of 17 points,-

enough to have him = stand out as a
prominent ﬁgure in the melee.

But it is altogether unfair to the
other men'on that wonderful mach-
ine to single out any individual star.
DeHart replaced Meadows in the
closing minutes of play and -negotia-
ted a few scintillating dashes, one of
which was good for 60 yards. At

A ’ some time or other every man on the

team became conspicuous. Thornhill
gave the audience a thrill when he fell

‘ on Higgins who had darted for the

goal posts on a recovered fumble.
I-Iockensmith upset the State attack
at the beginning. Soppitt, Sutherland,
‘Peck, despite his «recent illness, Her-
ron, Carlson and eyeryone alse put
up the ﬁght of their lives. Is it any
wonder State lost?

George McLaren started the game

I in place of Ted Fry, and the former

Peabody luminary was as good as
ever. He never failed to plow the line
when some distance was needed for
Gougler, too, managed to

chance. He kicked a neat ﬁeld goal

SPLASHERS PREPARE
FOR ANNAPULIS MEET

The Pitt splash team after their
victory over the P. A. A.‘ rteam is
showing great interest in their work
and every man is trying to get into
the best possible condition for the big
meet with the Navy, at Annapolis.

The opportunity of the present
swimming team to overcome the Navy
hoodoo is an added incentive for the
men of the «squad to get in the best
possible condition. Especially is this
true of several of the boys who have
gone down to defeat before the sail-
ors‘ and it is their fond dream that
they will be able to haul down the
banners of Uncle ».Sam’s school.

More candidates are wanted for po-
sitions on the swimming team. Any-
one who has“ had any practice in the
past should come out in order that the
coach may get a line on what it is
possible to do. Pitt’s teams for the
past few years have been exceptional-
ly strong but with the incoming class
there has been an added increment
that has ﬁlled several of the places
that were left vacant from last year.

All men, who want to try out for
positions on the team should report
to C. }S. Miller at the gym.

 

Warner's Part Evident

Underlying Pitt’s great performance
could be seen the master hand of
Glenn Warner. His wonderful inter-
ference, his smooth running attack,
his close following of the ball at all
times was to his credit as exhibited by
his pupils. The game closed a won-
derful season and one worthy of the
brilliant machine and the able tutor-
ing of such a coach. A

State placed her hopes on the sterl-
ing caliber of her backﬁeld, but admit-
ting .Pitt’s prowess on the defense, it
is small surprise that men, like Berry-
man, Ewing and Clarke could not
penetrate the Gold and Blue forwards
effectually, The talent of these men
is far above the ordinary and at va-
rious times they displayed threaten-
ing speed and power, but their on-
slaughts were shortlived and availed
them nothing but the honor of having
given Pitt a splendid scrap. Ewing
shouldered his teammates a bit by
his remarkable. tackling, saving many
a point for his team by his accurate
and hard defensive efforts.

{I3 ELEEIEII  
llllﬁ LEADER

Robert Durham Peck, Jr., formerly
of Lock Haven, Pa., but now of Pitt
and national fame was selected to lead
the 1916 Pitt football team. The elec-
tion took place immediately following

 

the Pitt--State game and Peck was .

elected on the- ﬂrst. ball-oft‘, by the
men who were given the varsity in-
signia.

The result, of the election caused no
surprise to either the students or the
public in general. The Wonderful
ﬁghting spirit shownnby the redoub't-
able Titian-haired center has instilled
the fighting spirit into the team and
no little credit should be given to him
for the wonderful record piled up by
the Gold and Blue» team this year. A
year ago he was mentioned for the
same position and although the honor
was delayed for a season, yet this year
his fellow players. gave him their vote
of conﬁdence in his ability and their
appreciation of himself as a man
when they elevated him to this -po-
sition. The honor is a great one and
as such is not to be lightly thought of.

Peck came to the University with
the class of .1917. He prepared for
his college course at Conway Hall.
It was as halfback that he started his
career on the gridiron, and it wasat
this positionlthat he played for the
first season. However, Coach Duff
saw his true worth and shifted him
to the line. Duff’-s judgment has cer-
tainly been vindicated by the results,
as Pe-ck has «turned out to- be one of
the greatest centers that ever passed
theiball to the quarter.
“Bob” still thinks. that he should be
in the backﬁeld and is continually
practicing at that position, when th
coach is not looking. -

Peck will, without doubt, be - W.
Camp's selection for the, All-American
this year. Many of the best critics
in the land have already picked him
for their teams and it is reasonably

sure that he will be the choice of the

majority. The captain-elect has cut-
played any, center that he has played
against during the past two years.
Cool of Cornell, and McEwan of the
Army, are the only men in the col-
leges today that are mentioned in the
same breath with the husky Pittite.

The following men were awarded
letters for the past season. 7 Includ-
ed in this number. were only two
freshmen, Sies and iM,cDaren. It was
rather a surprie to many that more
of the men. did not get letters but
the committee decided otherwise. Of
the men receiving letters only three
will be lost by graduation, namely
Captain Williamson, Shapiro, and
Beattie. Practically all the other men
will be available for the team next
year.

Warner with all this amount of ma-
terial from the Varsity along with the
recruits from the first year team
should be able to produce a. team that
will owtshine the record compiled by
the team this year. A scoring ma-
chine has always been the long-look-
ed for desire of every Pittite and
hopes are high that Warner will pro-
duce a point-a-minute team for 1916.

From the Freshmen team there are
a number of men who are ﬂrst class
material for the varsity next year.
From the backﬁeld there are Smith,
Easterday and Hell, all of whom are
capable men. On the line there are
a. number of big men but who they
will ﬁnally pick to go to next year

. is still unknown.

.Mah.an modestly states that when he
was off ‘color “deah
naturally lost to Cornell. At the same
time Brickley gr-ives Harvard ﬂrst hon-
ors. How any team that is a one man
affair can lay claim to the champ-
ionship is beyond our ken. Still I
suppose that it is hardly expected for
us pr-ovincials to understand «the reas-
onings of the Easterners when they

ﬁgure out who is to get ﬁrst honors. ‘

 

From a correspondent: “T-he height
of asininiity has been reached by the
Mt. Union College Varsity Letter
=Club ‘when they declared that they
would expel any member who played
professional football after leaving col.-
le-ge”. ‘Still as some one remarked
“Gee, what an honor to belong to the
Mt. Union College Club.”

 

A letter has been received by the
writer of this column from John Gar-
vin, '15, who is attending Yale Grad-
uate School, protesting against an al-
leged insult offered to Yale spirit.
The cause of the protest was the fol-
lowing statement:

Harvard eﬁiciency——41, Yale spirit
0.. We apologize Johnny, but how
many points did Yale score? We were
only pointing out that spirit alone
never won a football game, even if it
is a Yale eleven.

 

We are going to publish in the next
issue of our noble sheet, an all-Pitt
eleven that has -been sent in by an
alumnus. We would like to receive
more of these. If you are interested
think it over and send in your favor-
ites. We do not promise to publish
them all but w-e will do the best we
can.

 

The A. A. U. is in danger of losing
out all along the line. They have giv-
en up the idea of trying to control
basketball, and there is a great deal
of dissatisfaction in many quarters.
Their prohibition on summer ball and
a few of their other rules are either
evaded entirely or no attention is paid
to them. This organization, at one
time, did a great deal but they are in
danger of listening too much to the
Eastern representatives and of lag-
ging behind the more advanced ideas
of the West and M1d_dl‘e-West.

It is rumored that .

old Hahvard” .

Coach Harlow said, after the game,
that Pitt -could beat Harvard by as
big a score as they did State. One
of the State players, -asked about the
game, answered: “Downhearted ?
Why, didn’t we hold you to 20 points?
At that State has nothing to be asham-
ed of. Their ﬁght against the re-
lentless attack of the irresistible Pitt
backs and forwards was one of the
gamest and most desperate ﬁghts ever
put up by an opposing team that by a
losing eleven.

 

We asked our oﬁi-ce boy to h d in
his selections for the mythica All-
American. In about ﬁve minutes he
came back and askedif Freshmen
we‘re'e1igib-le for positions on the
teams. We asked why, and he said
he had selected the members of the
ﬂrst, second and third teams, but that
there were not enough players on the
Pitt squad to make a fourth.

Basketball practice is going on mer-
rily at the «gym and the amount of
material that is being displayed as-
sures that the Pitt ﬂoor team will be
one that one need not be ashamed of.

The appearance of‘ the members of
the football squad on the ﬂoor has
greatly increased the chances of Pitt
against the Championship Yale team
that invades this section about the
21st of December. It is to be hoped

that the Coach will be awake to the
need of .a great deal‘ of team work if
he wishe-s to hold the strong New
Haven ﬁve when they line up against
the Blue and Gold men: The Yale
team was the best in the land last
year and with practically the same
team back in the game it lo-oks as
though Coach Flint is up against a
tough proposition.

The material that has presented it-
self is both good and plentiful. In
fact the number of former star high
school players is almost bewildering
and when it c-omes to picking the best,
it Certainly must be a sort of. hit
and miss affair. It is certainly too
bad that the University is not sup-
plied with another basketball ﬂoo-r in

 

order that all might get an equal:

chance to show what they .-are worth.
It certainly would be a needed im-
provement if a new gym or basketball
floor was provided so that those who
wish to do so might practice when-
ever they wish to.

With the closing of the gridiron
season Hastings, Carlson, M-cNulty,
Hell, M-cLaren,. Matson, Easteq-day
and one or two others have reported
for practice. All these men are in
good physical condition and are ready
for the hardest knocks and the hard-
est fought game. '

Pitt’s claim to the championship of
the state last year wasdisputed by
«the Allegheny College ﬁve. No doubt
they had a wonderful team but this
year ‘the Pittites will be on the look-
out and then the Meadville. boys
slhould be on guard. Pitt easily won
t e
the state last year and it looks as
though we were on a. ship of pros-
perity together.

(Ed. Not——The following is an ex-

tract from a letter received at our 

office from the World’s Student Chris-
tian Federation, through its secre-
tary, Dr. John‘ R. «Mott. Its appeal
needs no comment.)
New York, Oct. 25, 1915.

To the Christian Students and Teach-

ers of the Colleges, Universities

and Schools of America:

As the second winter of the Great
War draws near with its inevitable

increase in the volume of suffering,
there is a matter which should receive
the urgent attention of the students
and professors of the colleges, uni-
versities and_ schools of America. We
have not realized as fully as we
should have done the great demands
which this struggle has made upon
the students of the countries now at
war. A recent ...report states that
nearly 75 per cent of the men students
of the colleges and universities of
Great Britain have already entered the
army, nearly 11,000 undergraduates and
graduates of Cambridge University
alone having gone to the war. In
Germany nearly, if not quite, 50,000
university students are in the army,
and an even .larger number of the old-
er -school boys. When I was in Paris-
within a year, where I had been in
the habit of. ﬁnding inother years as
many as 18,000‘male students in the
Latin Quarter, it was with di culty
that I assembled a small group of
four. The proportions‘ of university
men of Austria, Hungary and Russia
who are in the ﬁghting lines or in
military training are nearly as large.
From nearly every Canadian univer-
sity fully one-half of the men have
gone to join the army‘. A

The needs and opportunities of our
fellow students in the Christian Stu-
dent Movements of Europe present an
irresistible call to the students and
professors of America. Never before
has ourhelp -been somuch needed,
and probably never again in all the
coming years will there be such a de-
mand made for our sympathy and
practical cooperation. It is an oppor-
-tunity for us to show the reality’ of
our Christian faithand of our Chris-
tian love. I confess at times with
sinking of theheart that my solici-
tude in these days is not for the stu-
dents of the lands now at war. They
are stirred to their deepest depths
and are placing themselves with all
their powers at the disposal of their
nations and in the service of their
ideals. Neither is my anxiety for the

[students of, neutral countries. near

the war theater, that is, the students

of Holland, Switzerland. and Scandi-

navia, for they have entered to a won-
derful degree into fellowship with
their fellow students in the countries
at war and are seeking to help them.
My fear is for the students of Amer-
ica, lest in this dark hour of the

V world-’s need we may be .indifferent_
M or callous to the claims of our fellow

students in Europe and not enter suf-
ficiently into fellowship with their
sufferings and into cooperative effort
to enable them to meet their oppor-
tunities. If they are willing to give

their lives and all that they possess
for their ideals, should we not show
alike ability to deny ourselves for

the sake of rendering unselﬁsh ser-
vice. '
4 In response-to many suggestions it
is proposed to raise during the next
few weeks before Christmas, a gen-
erous, unselﬁsh offering in which it is
hoped that every American student
and professor who learns of it may
participate, and that this offering be
sent to the Christian Student Move-
ments of the different European coun-
tries as a Christmas "gift from their
fellow students in America, to be used
by these Movements in safeguarding
their most valuable work in the Eu-
ropean universities, and also in fur-
thering their practical Christian min-
istry among the millions of menunder
arms. Surely there is no American
student who will not gladly give a
dollar or more, even out of poverty,
when these facts are brought t-0 his
attention. , . V '

All gifts should be sent promptly
to John R. Mott, 124 East Twenty-
Eighth Street, New York City.

Very sincerely yours, _

_ V JOHN R. MOTT,
General Secretary of the World’s Stu-

dent Christian Federation. ‘

\

years. ago he was crowned as the ‘very
ﬁrst man in the affections and esteem
of his fellow townsmen,’ in Pittsburgh.
“It is an honor to the University to
have the devoted service through
these years of such a man “as John
A. Brashear, and it is an honor also
to participate in the celebration of his

seventy-ﬁfth anniversary day, and to _

wish him good health, vigor of mind,
high courage, a fruitful activity for
long years yet to come.” 0
