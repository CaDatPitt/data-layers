State may cut Pitt's funds

By Heather Gahres
Asst. News Editor

The University of Pittsburgh may lose $4.9 million in state
appropriations next year, Executive Director of the Senate
Appropriations Committee Bob Bittenbender said.

In the state Senate’s budget plan, Pitt and the other three state-
related universities would receive a 3.S—percent cut in state
appropriations, Bittenbender said.

However the state House of Representatives passed its proposed
budget, which would cut Pitt’s state appropriations by 4.2 percent

The House's and the governor's plans would eliminate funding
received by "Pitt’s Johnstown and Bradford campuses, Maureen
McClure, University Senate Budget Policies Committee co—chair,
said.

“I don’t know if legislation is punishing the new president for ﬁxing
up his house’ against the University Senate’s Budget Policies
Committee,” McClure said. “I would hope that next year the
university works very hard with the state and public to reestablish
its credibility.” - g

Pitt’s Commonwealth Relations Director Dennis McManus and
Assistant Director Ann Dykstra are currently in Harrisburg lobbying
against the budget cut.

“The level of funding is so limited. Therefore the ﬂexibility of
change is also limited. [The lobbyists] have less of an opportunity to
effect the change,” Bittenbender said.

Bittenbender said the tight fiscal condition of the commonwealth .

Pitt works for minority retention

By Julie Sabol
News Editor

Calling for a minority program
coordinator, a faculty and staff
cultural diversity workshop and
additional minority scholarship
programs, the Senate
Undergraduate Affairs

Committee recommended a

Minority Retention Resolution
to the Faculty Assembly
yesterday.

I ’ “The main goal is to improve

the environment for minority
‘ retention at Pitt," chair of Senate

Undergraduate. Affairs
Committee Jonathan Schooler
said. ’ ' G _
Schooler said the current
minority retention rate, 36
percent, is unacceptable and
programs need to be installed
to improve it. -
The Assembly unanimously

but

passed the proposal which will
now move to the Budget Policies
Committee for. approval.
Though the proposal’ mustbe
passed by the entire University
Senate and then approved by
O’Connor, Schooler is hopeful
the programs will be
implemented as soon as possible.
“In the ideal world, the year
after next these programs would
be at least beginning,” Schooler

said

The proposal made four
recomendations. First, it calls for
a minority program coordinator
who would serve as a liasion
between the existing programs.

The minority program
coordinator would not take over
the programs currently in place,
would serve as a
communicator between various
groups to help‘ them run more
efficiently.

The coordinator would also

be responsible for revising and
consolidating some current
programs that have been
. having difficulties.

“There’s been a lot of
‘fragmentation and
decentralizition between the
departments dealing with
minority issues, so a minority
coordinator could help to
correct some of the

fragmentation that exists at the

administrative level,” chair of
the Black Action Society Marcus
Guy said.

The second aspect of the
proposal addresses the need
for faculty and staff to become
aware of the complex issues
associated .with cultural
diversity at Pitt, Schooler said.

The proposal calls for a half-
day Cultural Diversity

workshop which all current -

faculty and staff would be

Due to city budget cuts, the fire pumper at Oakland's Fire House

The pumper is the fire truck that carries the hoses and water to a

Fire House 14 Captain John Trenz said that the removal of the

Penguins win Stanley Cup for second straight year

By Ryan Buncher
Asst. Sports Editor

It wasn’t as easy as some expected, but
the Penguins clinched their second straight
Stanley Cup championship with a 6-5
victory over the Chicago Blackhawks
Monday night. — .

Pittsburgh won the first three games by‘

a combined four goals to put themselves
on the brink of the championship.

Most experts called for a blowout, using
the Pens’ past history of blowing out
opponents when they had a chance to put
a team away. i

In order to avoid a fiasco such as the one
that occurred after the team won the cup
in Minnesota last season, the Pens
announced that the team’s flight back to
Pittsburgh that night would land at a
remote site which would be kept secret.

The key to Pittsburgh’s success has
been a very offensive minded team playing
great defense, but this night would be a
shootout.

“This was like a regular season game for

us tonight the way we played defensively,”
Pens goalie T om Barrasso said, “If we get
in a game like that, you have to like our
chance. We’ve got too mu ch’ talent to lose
in a shootout.”

The Penguins came out as if they would
put the game away early, as Jaromir Jagr
fired a wristshot by Chicago goaltender
Ed Belfour to give Pittsburgh a 1-0 lead
just 1:37 into the game. Dirk Graham
answered five minutes later as he charged
in alone on Barrasso. He stopped the first
shot, but Graham slammed a rebound
home to tie the game.

Pittsburgh retook the lead only twelve

seconds later as Kevin Stevens slid the

puck past Belfour on a play set up by a
Mario Lemieux. Chicago coach Mike
Keenan then yanked Belfour, putting
Dominick Hasek in the goal.

Almost as quickly as the tie was broken,
Grahamtied it again as Chris Chelios set
him up with a pass to the doorstep after
forcing a turnover in the Penguins’ end of
the ice. Graham came up big every time
the Blackhawks needed it in the first

period.

Later in the period Lemieux scored on a
power play set up by a viscious elbow
delivered by Chelios to the back of the
head‘ of Pittsburgh defenseman Larry
Murphy. Lemieux flipped a rebound of a
Murphy shot over a fallen Hasek to give
the Pens back the lead. Graham then came
up with his third goal of the period as he
snuck in the goal crease behind Barrasso
and shot a Brian Noonan pass into the net.

Rick T occhet gave the Penguins a quick
start in the second period. Stevens grabbed
the puck behind the net and threw it out
to Tocchet in front and the Pens’ winger

the puck in off the glove of Hasek for a 4-

5 lead.

Late in the period the Penguin defense
made a mistake and gave Jeremy Roenick,
Chicago's leading scorer who had been
held scoreless in the series,“ room near the
net and Roenick bounced the puck into
the net off the stick of Murphy to tie it up
again. i ' ‘

V Hasek was the story of the game after
that, stopping breakaway after breakaway,

including diving out to the blue line to
take the puck from Stevens who was
charging in alone.

Murphy finally broke through as his
shot from the point deﬂected off of a
group of players in front of the net and
over Hasek’s right shoulder to give the
Pens the lead.

Minutes later, Ron Francis and Shawn
McEachern charged in on a two—on-one
while Francis just fired the puck past
Hasek to extend the lead to two goals.

Chicago made one more run after
Roenick brought them within one goal
with just under nine minutes left. But
Barrasso stopped everything Chicago
threw at them, including Michel Goulet’s
shot from right in front with just under ten
seconds left. As that last threat was crushed,
the celebration began with the team
mobbing Barrasso.

“Oh Lord Stanley, Lord Stanley get me
the brandy," Pens announcer Mike Lange
cried. '

After a pause, the Chicago crowd broke

Television kiosks to placed on campus

ByAndrea Barczykowski
Stajf Writer

Students will soon be able to
see student made films and have
access to campus information by
viewing Kiosks which will be at
various locations around the
university.

A Kiosk is a television which
can be programed through the
University Center for Instructional
Research in Hillman Library. One
Kiosk is already located on
the ground floor of Forbes
Quad.

According to Engineer
Technical Coach for UCIR Max
McGee, no one has programed
anything specific for the Kiosk.

“[Up until now] the Kiosks have
shown general educational
programs and have been used
on occasion to promote
lUCIRl.”

The equipment was purchased
for the Campus of the Future
program in 1987 and is used for
distance education between Pitt's
main campus and its branch

campuses.

McGee is interested in getting’

faculty members to utilize the
center for programing on the
Kiosks.

“We want everyone to know
that we can produce everything
from here. This is a do-it-yourself
lab.

We want [the faculty} to be
involved. That’s what Media
Resources is here for, but until
they see it happen they don’t
know what they can do,” McGee
said.

Also working on the program
is Brian Wittle, president of
Students for Media and Art
Exhibition.

Wittle wanted to program
information about different
offices and organizations at Pitt,
but he ran into many pro-
blems.

“Originally I wanted to produce
my own video about Pitt life. I
wanted to show it at times during
the day when a lot of students
would be around, but I found
that I couldn’t do that unless the

differentluniversity organizations]
specifically asked me to. There’s
nothing you can do that someone
doesn’t have a problem with, so
we won’t show anything that has
to do with just the university, but
we will show things that have to
do with the students,” Wittle
said. ~

Wittle plans to use the Kiosks
to show ﬁlms made by students
and wants to encourage anyone
who has a film to fill out an
application.

“I have 10 to 12 applications
right now. Right away it’s going

to be slow, but by the time the
term starts I think it will be big,”
Wittle said.

Although few people know
what the Kiosks are, Wittle
believes that people will watch
the student movies.

“I think people will watch them,
especially the people who made
[the films]. If they’re going to be
around the Kiosk they’ll probably
drag their friends with them,”
Wittle said.

McGee doesn’t expect much
interference from the university
concerning the films.

“In a university setting with an
attitude that allows for creative
process, there will be very little
censorship,” McGee said.

By June 8, the Kiosk in Forbes
Quad should be programed, and
possibly fiveor six more Kiosks
will be taken out of storage and
programed. UCIR has every-
thing it needs for the program-

ing.

“Everything is already here; I 9

don’t foresee any additional
costs,” McGee said.

Vacancy ﬁlled

Franklin joins Pitt's black studies department

By Carmen M. McGill
For The Pitt News

With a doctorate in social work
and a strong desire for black
students to be educated, Dr.
Agnes Franklin joined the black
studies faculty at the University
of Pittsburgh in January of this
year

When the black studies
department found itself with an
unexpected vacancy, Franklin
was asked to join the staff.

For the past 22 years Franklin
has worked at the Right Start
Institute for the Black Family,

‘training its day care staff to be

sensitive to the needs of teenage
mothers and their babies.

Franklin has also done
community work for the
Allegheny Health Department by
recruiting young mothers to
attend baby clinics.

“For the past 16 years I have
worked with young mothers and
their babies in the Pittsburgh
public school system. It has
probably been the most
rewarding job I’ve ever had,” she
said.

In addition to her social work,
Franklin has taught child
development and beginning
psychology at the Community
College of Allegheny County
South Campus in West Mifflin as
well as black psychology at
Chatham College. ,

This past semester, Franklin
taught a black family course at
Pitt. “I was surprised [that]-many

aware,” she said.

“Culture must start before
college. My job is simply to
enhance it,” Franklin said.

According to Franklin, being
in contact with students is one of
the most enjoyable aspects of
teaching. “I feel that students use
me for more than just a professor.
They tell me about their
problems,” she said.

The University of Pittsburgh

ready to begin trans-

into humans in several

Drugs that would prevent

The best matches for
humans are baboons, pigs and

The procedure will only

said.

Medical center Spokes-
person Lisa Rossi said the
rejection drugs have not yet

' been approved by the federal

government and the cross-
species organ transplants are
probably at least a year in the
future.

She also said Martin was not I

in charge of the project and
therefore was not qualified to

The first baboon-to-human
transplant occurred in 1984,

known as Baby Faye, received

Magee to teach CIS modern health care

By George Kopec
Staff Writer

Health care in the former Soviet

Union is in need of assistance,’

from the physical state of the
hospitals to the prevalent attitudes
of the society, according to
Director of Public Relations of
Magee—Women’s Hospital Pam
Golden.

“Our [Soviet] birthing practices
are a national tragedy,” Dr. Yurii
Puchkov, director of international
exchanges at the Academy of
Medical Sciences, said.

“Our society believes that
humiliation, degradation and
suffering in childbirth is the fate
of women," one Russian health-
care worker said.

In an effort to improve the
situation, representatives from
Magee will soon travel to Russia
to provide both training for
health—care professionals and
health education for the women
and children of Russia and the
Commonwealth of Independent
States. ’ ’

Magee representatives will be
acting in partnership with
MiraMed Institute, a Seattle-
based, non—profit, publicly
supported organization dedicated
to bringing culturally sensitive
models for women’s health care
and medical training programs
to places in great need, Golden
said.

“Magee’s st_rength in
community outreach coupled
with its record of quality maternity
care and teaching makes it the
ideal hospital to work with to
ensure the success of this project,”
Tanya M. Kotys, director of
development for MiraMed,
said.

From May 7 to 19, a group of
five Magee representatives,
including hospital President Irma
Goertzen, took an “assessment
trip” to Moscow.

.“The purpose of this first trip
was to identify priorities and to
develop a more concrete plan of
how we will achieve our goals,”
Golden said. -

Russia has an infant—mortality

rate of 23 deaths per 1,000, versus
the 9.1 per 1,000 rate in the
United States, according to
Golden.

Fifty percent of infants have
health problems at birth, and 50
percent of people with AIDS in
Russia are children, she said.
Ninety—five percent of Russian
women have no access to birth
control.

These staggering statistics
indicate‘ that the MiraMed—Ma gee
group will have its work cut out
for it during the three—year
program, Golden said.

“We want to undergo a learning
and teaching process, one that
will work both ways,” she said.

As for the prevalent opinions
of Russian society, Golden said,
“First we mustdecide, Do actions

— follow attitudes, or do attitude

follow actions?” r

The Russian government has
donated space in Moscow City
-Hospital #70 for the project, and
Golden said it may expand to
other cities and regions in the
future.

Bomb tbreozt

clears union

By Jason Hillman
Managing Editor

A bomb threat caused the‘

William Pitt Union and the
Cathedral of Learning to be
evacuated at 10:30 p.m. last night.

Following Secret Service
guidelines, campus police
searched both buildings for a
half-hour before readmitting
people. “We took all the
necessary precautions,” campus
police Sgt. Roger Dixon said.

The city received a call from
someone claiming to be from the
FBI, according to city police
officer R.A. Mackovich.

The person said a bomb would
go off in a building on Fifth and
Bigelow. The city then called Pitt
and dispatched two city police
officers to the scene. The campus
police then sent six officers to
search the buildings.

The university policy for bomb
threats is for the campus police
to present the facts of the case to
the" building manager and then
let that person make a decision.
The campus police can override
the building manager’s decision.
“We do have the public safety
responsibility for Pitt," Dixon said.

Dixon said the threat did not fit
the profile of similar situations.
“lButI we don’t dismiss this sort
of thing at all,” he said.

is causing the cuts, which are unusual for state-related universities to receive.

The state would be able to reallocate funds if additional money would become available, Bittenbender

said. Where the funds would be reallocated would be a question of the state’s priorities.
The state Senate should vote on its proposed budget plan next week, Bittenbender said.

Prof receives recognition
for personal achievement

By Bruce Boul
St_a_[f Writer

Pitt Philosophy Professorjohn
Mcdowell has recently been
recognized by the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences for

‘ his eminence in scholarship and

professional attainments.

Mcdowell was elected on April
8 in Boston as one of the 3,000
fellows nationwide into the
Academy for his entire body of
work in metaphysics and
epistemology; philosophy of
mind and language; ancient
Greek philosophy and ethics.

“Most of my work deals with
the place ofthe human mind and
the rest of the world,” Mcdowell
said. And as an elected fellow to
the Academy, he will meet with
the other fellows from time to
time to give lectures.

According to Mcdowell, the
American Academy of Arts and
Sciences sponsors projects that
relate the intellectual resources
of the learned professions to
problems of science and of social
and technological change; and
elects fellows and honorary
members for their achieved

distinction in intellectual ﬁelds.

His career began in 1966 at
Oxford University and has been a
Fellow of the British Academy
since 1983. Mcdowell came to
Pitt in 1986 as a professor of
Philosophy and has been a
University Professor in the
Department of Philosophy since
1988.“I came to Pitt for a lot of
reasons,” Mcdowell said. “Mainly
because I was depressed by the
British government under
Thatcher,” he said. '

Mcdowell also added that he
carried an extremely heavy
teaching load in England, and
Pitt's philosophy department was
“extremely attractive.”

He has written and lectured
extensively on numerous topics,
including thejohn Locke Lectures
at Oxford University in 1991, and
held visiting appointments at
various universities in the United
States and India.He is a native of
South Africa andreceived his
B.A. from the University College
of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in

Salisbury, Rhodesia in 1962; a‘

second B.A. in 1965 and his M.A.
from New College, Oxford in

Philosophy and Ancient History.

encouraged to attend and all new
employees would be required to
attend as part of thier
orientation.

Schooler said the workshop
would offer a broad perspective
of cultural diversity, racism as
well as sexism would be
addressed.

A competive scholarship and

support program for motivated

minority students in their

second, third or fouth years

was also recom-
mended.

The scholarship would be
awarded on the basis of academic
perfomance as well as letters of
recomendation, leadership and
general potential.

Support would be provided to
outstanding minority students by
offering challenging cu rriculums,

financial assistance and peer

and community‘ support
groups.
Lastly, the committee

recommended a minority support
fund drive to solicit support
from alumni and corporations
to improve Pitt’s ability to
attract, retain and
graduate outstanding minority
students.

The money acquired from fund
drives would be used to support
the proposed programs, fund
additional minority scholarships

_ and programs and attract new

minority faculty to Pitt.
Though Schooler said he was

;plea_sed, with the f,acul_tyj;s

response to the proposal, he said
there was still a lot of work that
needed to be done.

“What we’ve provided is the
basic skeleton, there's a lot more
details that need to be worked
out.

We’ve provided suggestions for
a number of different ways the
university can get involved,”
Schooler said.

Though the proposal is a good
first step, and Guy said he is
optimistic about its future, he
said support must come from
high—level administrators if the
programs are to become a
reality. ’

“[Minorityl retention is not a
problem, it’s a symptom of a
much larger problem which deals
with institutional committment.
The commitment currently comes
from mid-level adminsitrators,
but it needs to come from
[O’Connor] and the Board of
Trustees in order for programs to
succeed. Retention is not a root
problem, lack of university
committment is,” Guy said, “I’m
very interested to see what
the result of the proposal will
be."

Minority retention is not a
problem for only adminis-
trators and faculty to be
concerned with Schooler said,

V students must become involved

as well.

concerns. It’s very important to

BAS as well as all other students
are hopefully going to
become involved,” Schooler
said.

Members from both SGB and
the BAS said they would be willing
to work with Schooler and his

I committee to help finalize the

proposal.

“Student involvement is crucial
and I’m really glad Schooler
realizes the important beneﬁts
that studnet evaluation will
provide,” SGB member and

‘advisor to the SGB Multi-
cultural Committee Ross Pasquale
said.

Guy said he finds it interesting
that the BAS has historically been
involved with minority retention,
but it is only now that the
Faculty Assembly addresses this
issue. He said the BAS supports

THE PI'I'I' NEWS, Wednesday, June 3, 1992

the proposal and its four
points. ,

“I think it’s about time. We’re
very happy the committee has
taken this initiative. We beleive
this is the tip of the iceberg for
retention programs. We’re
looking forward to working with
the FAS committtee,” Guy
said.

Pasquale said these proposals
are long overdue and he will
assist the committee in any way
he can.

“This is wonderful this is being
done, it should have been a long
time ago, I feel it’s unfortunate
it’s coming from Schoolers
committee, it should have
come from a higher level, but I'll
personally help in in any
way that I can,” Pasquale
said.

 

“I would deﬁniately be willing
to work with the BAS and any
other pertinent groups in order
to finalize the draft and to have a
final draft that would reflect the
needs of the student body,”
Pasquale said.

Speaking on behalf of the BAS,
Guy gave their support. “W/e’re

willing to work with anybody V

who wants to help with the issue.
These [four recomendations]
are all positive steps,” he
said.
Schooler recognized the need
for administrators support as well.
“I am cautiously optimistic but
I recognize in order for this to be
_successful it will take a serious
committment on the part of the
administration and I'm hopeful
this will occur,” Schooler
said.

hazardous area, Trenz said.

The removal of the pumper
could lead to a tragedy in
Oakland like the one at
California University of
Pennsylvania, Trenz said. A
California University student
died in a fire in his fraternity
house last spring.

Quick responses to ﬁres at
parties on York Way and
Atwood Street prevented the
spreading of fires to other
buildings, T renz said. “What’s
prevented tragedy [in Oakland]
is a quick response by our
pumper,” he said.

There will be about a 50- to
45—second difference in the
response times to fires in South
Oakland, Trenz said.

“Does that add to the risk of
a fire? What if Fire House 14
was putting out a dumpster fire
and another station had to cover
a fire? There are too many
variables,” Dickinson said.

Because the hospitals and
residence halls have sprinkler
systems installed in their
buildings, the removal of the
pumper will not seriously affect
them, Trenz said.

The area that will be affected
most by the removal of the
pumper is South Oakland,
where many students rent
apartments, Trenz said.

“Down below Forbes Avenue
is where the problem comes in
 Half of the buildings don’t
have smoke detectors, or if
they do [the smoke detectors]
are not working,” Trenz said.

City administrators disagree
with Trenz and said Oakland
will not be in danger.

Pens

into a standing ovation as their
team left the ice. That came to an
end as NHL Presidentjohn Ziegler
was announced. Ziegler, who is
reported to be on the way out,
drew a chorus of boos from the
crowd as he handed the Stanley
Cup to Pens captain Lemieux.

For Lemieux, this was just one
more addition to his list of
accomplishments. He won the
Conn Smythe Trophy for the
playoff Most Valued Player for
the second straight year after

' scoring 16 goals and 34 points in

only 15 games.

“lLemieuXl is the best player in
the world and he proved it again,”
Keenan said.

Lemieux played through the
playoffs with his chronic back
problems and a shoulder
separation He then played
through the last two rounds of

playoffs with a broken finger

which kept him out of the lineup
for the last four games of the
Patrick Division Final.

“l was su prised I won the Conn
Smythe,” Lemieux said,
“lBarrassol was superb in every
series.”

Barrasso proved yet again that
he can win in the playoffs,
continuing to answer questions
about his clutch play earlier in
his career.

He played in every game of the
playoffs and came up with many
key saves.

The team had some diverse
emotional reactions to the win.
The normally shy Jagr, still self-
conscious about his choppy
English, grabbed the microphone
from the hands of an interviewer
and started to praise his
teammates.

“This is for lLangel, ”Jagr added,
in a recreation of a scene from
the locker room last season, “Elvis

has just left the building.”

Many of the other Pens had
similar, giddy reactions.

“He’s what, 55 years old, and
he acts like a two-year-old.”
Tocchet said of Brian Trottier,
who was on a cup champion for
the sixth time.

“These guys make me feel good.
They bring me up,” Trottier
responded.

Though veterans of last season’s
championship said winning it all

V was sweeter this time, many of
the players were on a Stanley Cup
Champion team for the first time.

“We just got done doing this,”
rookie McEachern said.

Stevens said before the season
that the Pens had to win it all
again to prove themselves as a
great team. Not only did they win
it all again, they did it in
style.

They swept their last two series,
the conference finals against

Boston andthe cup finals against
Chicago.

The Blackhawks had won a
playoff record 11-straight games
entering the finals, a streak the
Penguins matched with Monday
night’s win.

After the game, Pittsburgh
coach Scotty Bowman, who
earned his sixth Stanley Cup ring

this season, said this team was

comparable to the great
teams he had seen in the
past.

Then came the subject of a

possible Penguin dynasty.

“These guys are talking
dynasty,” T occhet said, “I want
to be a part of this.”

The Stanley Cup was rumored
to have been all over the place as
the Penguins celebrated last year,
including ending up at the bottom
of Lemieux’s pool. '

“It’s going to swim again this
year,” Jiri Hrdina said.

Retention attention

At yesterday’s Faculty Assembly meeting, Senate Student
Affairs Committee Chairjonathan Schooler gained approval
for a strategy for minority retention. Although the University
of Pittsburgh recently ranked second among schools
achieving outstanding retention of African-American
students, the figures are unacceptable. Pitt ranked second
with a 36-percent retention rate of African-American
students. Even though the university could boast about
this “success,” the committee had the wisdom to march
forward to address inadequacies.

In response, the Minority Retention Resolution should
be acted upon as soon as possible. It offers fresh, bold
initiatives to erode prejudice on campus. Of its four
objectives, the Minority Program Coordinator is the most
essential.

Various university departments address issues under
the banner of “cultural diversity.” In many instances, their
attempts would be most successful in an environment
with close communication, with coordination provided
by a minority-program head and the active participation
of all minority students.

As the committee suggests, cultural-diversity workshops
are also important — and not just for students. Sexism,
homophobia or racism do not only afflict students. The
committee proposal for a faculty and staff half—day
workshop is along the right lines —— it is being viewed as
an ongoing process. .

Funding for racial minority scholarshipsfis not a new
idea, but the committee's skeleton proposal notes
“Competitive scholarships and support program for
motivated minority students in their second, third or
fourth [year].” This approach, is_ fresh. and empowering.
Calling for “special, challenging teachers and curriculum”
opens the doors for diversity. Calling for a “peer and
community support group” for those receiving support
will turn the poor college outlook around for African-
American students.

Finally a Minority Support Fund Drive soliciting support
from alumni and the non-Pitt community is essential. Any
proposal should harness energy and resources from
different sectors.

Now is the time/for action on behalf of disadvantaged
groups on campus. African-American student retention is
a national disgrace. Other historically disadvantaged
minority retention rates, such as lesbian, gay or bisexual
students, are not even calculated or examined by many
schools. Opportunities for disabled students should also
be on the table. For comprehensive action, the comrnittee’s
idea provides a great starting point.

Support from students, campus leaders, faculty and the
highest ranking administration is all equally important.
Higher education needs affirmative action, not permanent
inaction — this is a step in the right direction.

Hiring practices questioned

Just a few weeks ago the city of
Pittsburgh found itself-embroiled
in racial politics as civil-rights
groups, city police and the city
council debated heated issues
regarding present hiring practices.

“Most rookies until '93 to be
white, male,” the Post-Gazette
headline glared with seeming
distaste.

Based’ on a current list of
candidates having passed
preliminary entrance
examinations, the City of
Pittsburgh’s police department
has no other group of applicants
to choose from —- no women,
and specifically no blacks..

Naturally this has caused an
uproar with some special-interest
groups, including the NAACP,
which chose to make the hiring
of police officers a political
issue.

One of the key issues regarding
this situation is the extra “veteran’s
preference” points given to
applicants with previous military
experience.

The heavily biased article in
the Post—Gazettestates that, “Many
white men are aided” by a 10-
point bonus. Let’s back up for a
minute 

Aided?

It sounds like some
conspiratorial plot to infiltrate
the entire police department with
white males. The term
“preference” is somewhat
misleading, also. It implies that
only white men are given this

special treatment. The fact is,’

anyone having military
experience is eligible to receive
this consideration. The last time
I checked, black males had equal
access to the military and

therefore had just as much,

opportunity to take advantage of
these points.

Is the special consideration
necessary? If you change
“preference 0 points” to
“experience factor,” it makes a
lot more sense. The military is
one of the few places that has
jobs with descriptions similar to

Lou
Liberto

those of police officers. Finding
experienced personnel is not a
discriminatory practice. Certain
segments of the population would
have you believe so.

So how is it that only white
males are beneﬁtting from this?
Current levels have blacks, men
and women, comprising over 20
percent of the Armed Forces,
while only comprising a little
over 12 percent of the total
population.

I don’t want to play the numbers
game, though the idea that an
equal percentage of a population
must be represented is not only
unfair, itundermines the integrity
of the entire hiring process. Yes,
discriminating against qualified
applicants is just as bad as
discriminating against one’s skin
color. ,

However what should interest
everyone is matching the most
qualified person with the job. If
two people are equally qualiﬁed
but the one’ who is hired is chosen
because of his or her skin color,
then that is an entirely different
situation.

While examining the subject of
qualifications, the first of a long
series of catchy buzzwords and
phrases from the mouths of
affirmative action supporters is
culturally biased examinations.
The story goes that blacks don’t
score as high as non—blacks on
examinations like those given by
the police department because
the exams are written according
to white male standards.

This may be an acceptable
argument against SATs and IQ

_tests, but are the duties of police 4
officers subject to questioning.

along cultural boundaries? City
council wants to pay $80,000 to
find out.

With this in mind, lwho, if
anyone, carries the responsibility
to ensure that more blacks are
represented on the police force

or in any other sector of society? '

You? Me? Why not ﬁnd the blacks
who have made it in society,
American society, and observe
what they did to achieve their
success.

I’d be willing to bet that it won’t
be because they filed court actions
and other lawsuits against
individuals demanding that they
be hired solely because of their
race.

Experienced professionals,
black or white, male or female,
are those who the public would
really like to see hired with their
tax dollars.

We should not be willing to
compromise public safety to
preserve some abstract, unrealistic
ideal touted as “equal
representation.”

Women empower themselves by seeking political office

Available money and women’s anger about the Clarence
Thomas hearings last October have motivated more
women to run for 1992 Senate seats.

This year there are 20 female U.S. Senate candidates
compared to eight in 1990, two in 1988 and six in 1986.
When the all—male Senate panel questioned Anita Hill
during Justice Clarence T homas’s Supreme Court
nomination hearings, thousands of women watched in
outrage.

Lynn Yeakel, the current Pennsylvania Democratic
Senate candidate, said, “I watched the hearings with a

There seems to be an ever-growing
movement in this country to regulate life

feelings about sexual harassment in the workplace.
Also on the panel was Senator Edward Kennedy (D.
Mass.), who at the time of the hearings had been accused
of wandering around his Florida estate without his pants
on and whose nephew was accused of rape by a female
guest at the estate. Kennedy denied hearing any screams

the night of the alleged incident. The nephew was found
not guilty of rape. Women wondered how a man who
seemed to be confused by his own sexual issues could
be impartial and fair to Anita Hill.

Then a few months later, boxer Michael Tyson was

' accused of raping a beauty contestant in his hotel room.

He was later convicted and given a six-year prison
sentence. Throughout the trial, Tyson was convinced that
he would be found not guilty, partly because the court
ruled against admitting evidence of Tyson’s prior sexual
harassment of women. 1

However, several of these sexual incidents were detailed
in the press for women around the nation to glower over.
The fact that this previous harassment was not admissible
evidence was unacceptable to them. . ,

Women’s anger focused on changing the political
system. The justice system was not listening to women.

‘Sexual abuse and harassment issues enter gray areas

where there is doubt about right and wrong and who is
guilty of what.

Victims are accused of compliance and are blamed for
not doing whatever their accusers feel should have been
done under the circumstances. It takes insight and
understanding to determine a fair response I0 all involved.
Watching the Thomas hearings, the Kennedy-Smith trial

 

and the Tyson trial, women felt that a fair response was
not given to the female victims involved. Now women in
many states are taking action to work toward a change in
the justice system.

Yeakel said the Thomas hearings “galvanized people.
They realized that there were 98 men and two women
and no people of color [in the Senatelt

The voters realized it was time we had better
representation in the Senate.” The justice system will not
change until minorities and women are equally represented

enforce. A

Female candidates will need continued support to be
elected. Evidence of this continued support lies in the
sizable rise in funding of female candidates this year.
Emily’s List, a feminist fundraising group, will raise $3
million this year, compared to $1.5 million raised two
years ago. i

A Republican group, Women in the Senate and House
(WISH), raised $150,000 in its first two months of
operation. These women’s political action committees,
both liberal and conservative, have become more
sophisticated about raising funds for candidates. Several
of these groups also train female candidates to run and

‘then give them money early in their races.

Women have the potential to become politically
empowered because they are now more financially
sophisticated and have learned to focus their anger about
not being fairly represented.

This newly gained political power will enable female
candidates to successfully run for office. When the new
candidates‘ take office in January 1993, there could be a
more equal representation in the Senate as well as in the
House.

Therefore in order for Kelly to be
consistent, these beliefs are mandated by
the fact that murder is simply murder
under each of these circumstances. It does
not matter whether we are referring to a

Murder is still murder.

However if Kelly happens to believe in

someone to death is a matter of justice,
and the difference is that a fetus has not

the convicted murderer has.

Therefore the criminal’s death is simply
a product of our society following its own
laws.

Kelly would also argue that allowing
someone to execute a living will, that is to -‘

justifiable under a variety of circumstances

Carnegie showcases Bearden retrospective

Pittsburgh Memories depicts life in a steel town.

By Megan Bertino
Editor in Chief

African-American life and culture come
to the Carnegie Museum of Artin the one-
man retrospective Memory and Metaphor:
The Art of Romare Bearden, 1940-1987.

Bearden, who died in 1988, is a world-
renowned artist best known for his collages
that depict life for both rural and urban
blacks in America.

Bearden, the grandson of a North
Carolina slave, once explained his work as
“lan attempt to] establish a world through
art in which the validity of my Negro
experience could live and make its own
logic.”

The retrospective explores Bearden’s
early cubist period with-selections from
The Passion of Christ and Garcia Lorca’s
"Lament for the Death of the Bullfighter”
series. The cubist selections are mainly
bright watercolors which move across the
canvass with surprising energy and feeling,
but several oils including Adoration of the

Wisemen and Madonna and Child are

painted in strong, deep colors that create
a stable energy, making the watercolors
seem more ﬂeeting. .

The final work in Lament, Even the Sea
Dies, gives an eerie finality to all life that
seems appropriate for a society bent on
saving the planet.

But the Bearden experience lies in the
powerful and provocative collages
synonymous with his name.

The collages incorporate multiple angles
and vanishing points that somehow create

an illusion so real it’s as if the work is a
photo. And yet the collages are real beyond
a photo. Bearden adds an element of
emotion that draws viewers ever closer,
putting them in a world of which they can
never be a part.

Bearden’s collages incorporate hundreds
of magazine cutouts. Faces are created by

using the nose of one man and the chin of__

another, by pasting the lips of one woman
over the face of another. But the eyes in
the collages are unmistakable. In so many
of Bearden’s works someone’s eyesystare
back at viewers. In Young Students, an
urban youth looks at viewers with eyes
that are captivating, questioning, powerful
and inescapable.

Bearden also has the ability to represent

a large cross-section of life in just one

collage. The Street. depicts musicians
performing in front of a New York City
apartment building. In the same work,

Bearden also shows viewers a cutaway of. 1,

a mother and child, a couple making love,
a man ascending a staircase to his home,
the Brooklyn Bridge and the New York
skyline. All this is done in unusual
proportions, vibrant colors and opposing
angles, but the surrealism of the work
pulls it into a reality even more real than
if the viewers were actually standingon
the street.

Bearden’sinspiration for drawing and;

cutaway views came from his childhood

friend Eugene who lived at his

grandmother’s Pittsburgh boarding house

for African—American steelworkers.

Bearden remembers his friend
in Farewell to Eugene, one of
the most moving collages in
the collection. Bearden creates
a funeral scene that is
sorrowful without being
melodramatic.

In his series Memories of
Pittsburgh, Bearden re-
members the years he spent
in Pittsburgh as a high-school
student. His collages show a
gray city with the skies
illuminated by the steel
factories’ fires.Throughout
Bearden’s work travels a
Tolstoyian train metaphor.
Like the Russian author,
Bearden was fascinated by
the passage of trains.

Bearden once said, “I use
the train as a symbol of the
other civilization — the white
civilization and its
encroachment upon the lives
of blacks.”

/Bearden said he felt. that
train tracks often cut through
neighborhoods populated by
blacks.

Trains pass by windows and
appear on the horizons of
Bearden’s works.

Bearden was born in North
Carolina and raised in Harlem.
He was educated at New York
University, Art Students’
League and The Sorbonne.
His works are as beautiful and

After a disastrous road trip
during which the Pirates lost
eight of nine games to West
Coast teams, the Buccos have
ﬁnally returned to Three Rivers.
Home sweet home is exactly
where they need to be as they
prepare for an important four-
game series with the division
rival New York Mets.

By compiling an 11-17 record
in May, the Pirates have

achieved their first losing,

- desperately need a good

showing in the New York series
to solidify their spot near or at

Because of many off—season
acquisitions by the Mets, most
U.S. sporting magazines have
picked them to finish atop the
East. However they have yet
to show signs of pulling away
fromthe pack and- making a

The Mets series is perhaps
that most anxiously awaited
this year because it will be the
first time Bobby Bonilla will
be back atThree Rivers Stadium
since he left the Pirates for
bright lights, big city and big

11 straight playoff wins, one easily forgets
a time when it looked as though the Pens

would never win another game; when the
loss of Lemieux guaranteed a Penguin de-
parture from the playoffs; when every-
one thought the Pens had no replacement
for Super Mario— until Francis stepped up.
Remember game four against the
Rangers? Without Lemieux, down 2-1 in
games and 4-2 in goals with a little over
eight minutes left in regulation, the Pens
were face-down on the mat, left for dead.
That is, until Francis willed them to win.
The shot heard ‘round Manhattan —— a
Francis 60—footer from outside the blue
line — resuscitated the dying corpse,
sending the Pens to a scintillating 5~4
overtime triumph. Francis would tip in the
game-winner and finish with a hat trick,
and the Pens would never look back,
winning the aforementioned 11 straight.
While Lemieux supplied the sensational
plays as only he can, Francis thrived in the
corners, behind the net and, when it was
needed most against the Rangers, at the
forefront. Unbeknownst to most, he
finished the playoffs as the third leading
scorer with 27 points, besting even press
darling Jaromir Jagr. In any other playoff
year, the former Hartford Whaler would
be hands—down MVP. But with Mr. Mario

on the same team, that’s just not a reality.
And with justifiable reason. While

playing in only 15 playoff games — seven V

with a broken hand —— Superman in a
Pens sweater tallied 16 goals and 18 assists
for a league—leading 54 playoff points. In
addition to his unmatched offensive
production, Lemieux played stellar defense
both in aggressively backchecking at every
opportunity and shadowing opposing
pointrnen in penalty-killing situations.

His end—to-end shorthanded goal against
perrenial Norris Trophy winner Ray
Bourque is one for the ages, next to his
seam—splitter against the Minnesota North
Stars in game three of last year’s finals.

But despite all Lemieux’s exploits, the
back-to—back sweeps of the Boston Bruins
and Chicago Blackhawks would not have
been possible, plain and simple, without
the unheralded play of Francis.

With his unselfish attitude and
underrated skills to match, Francis
seamlessly meshed with the ever-changing
character of Scotty Bowman’s lineup,
providing the Pens coach with a chameleon
in skates. For the Penguins coaching staff,
it became a redu ndant yet intelligent Abbott
and Costello routine:

Need a point man on the power-play?

Get Ronnie Francis. Need to kill a penalty?
Get Francis. A faceoff win? Get Ronnie.
Forechecking? Francis. Backchecking?
Number 10.First-line center? Ronnie.
Second—line center? Ditto.

More than any other member of the
Penguins, Ronnie Francis did whatever
was asked of him. Furthermore, he did it
with incredible skill, desire and class.

It was only fitting that Mr. Versatile
notched Pittsburgh’s Cup—clinching goal, a
50-foot laser from the left circle midway

“ll

through the third period. In the madness V

that is the postgame press binge, Scotty
Bowmanwent out of his way to men-tion
how proud and happy he was with one
particular player — Ron Francis.

What stands as the best memory of the
entire playoffs —and serves as a subtle yet
most deserving salute to one of Pittsburgh’s
best playoff performers ever — was the
sight of Ronnie Francis carrying the Cup
off the ice. Like his play on the ice, it wasn’t

a flashy or spectacular jaunt like Lemieux’s '

or Stevens’s. Only proud and dignified. A
fitting honor for a noble performer.

For without Francis, the Cup would not
be returning to the city of Pittsburgh.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, June 3, 1992 

Pitt should be commended for ‘doing the right thing’

By Stephen Flinn
Staﬂ“ Writer

Okay everybody, hold your
breath! Pitt’s football program is
in trouble.

As a result of a 15-page report
compiled after an in-house
investigation of its football team,
Pitt is guilty of, among other
things, NCAA recruiting
violations. The inquiry was
prompted by the investigative
reporting of local newspapers.
The process took about 15
months, although it seemed much
longer. Is this good news? Of
course not! Is this bad news? Well
 yes and no.

God knows what actions the
NCAA will take from here.
Remember, this is the same NCAA
that ostracized the poor little
Robert Morris basketball program
by making it pay NCAA

tournament money back and
banned it from postseason play
last year. The NCAA then turned
around and let ﬁlthy rich UNLV

defend its national title so the
Runnin’ Rebs could make a few
million dollars more. So at this
point your guess is as good as
mine as to what the NCAA will
actually do to Pitt’s football
program.

Whether you agree with Pitt’s
actions or not, there is an
important lesson to learn here:
Short—term gain in most cases
leads to long—term pain. If the
NCAA decrees that these
violations are punishable, the

actions were not worth it. This is _

because the consequences may
include not only NCAA sanctions
against Pitt’s football team, but
also the tarnishing of the
university’s name and the
character of the alleged violators.
A scar of this magnitude could
last a lifetime.

The university should be
commended for the way it
handled the situation. By
admitting guilt and opening itself
to possible NCAA punishment,
Pitt is addressing this problem in

Just write it.

Hey! Wanna be on the radio? I

Students interested should

mom would be proud.

Any questions
at

the best way possible. The
university is proving it does not
want to sweep any crumbs under
the carpet. Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor stressed institutional
control by stating that the football
program needs some work and
that while he is at Pitt, he will do
everything he can to make sure
conduct of this nature never
happens again.

So the short-term gain of
recruiting advantages, no matter
how minor these violations may
seem — such as giving out some
tee-shirts or letting a recruit stay
in a luxury hotel room —— will
never make up for the long—term
pain felt somewhere down the
road. Pitt did the right thing. The
university is voluntarily facing
some short-term pain in order to
realize long-term gain.

In other words, Pitt is facing
possible NCAA sanctions but is
guaranteeing a clean program in
the future with nothing to hide.
And why is the university doing
this? Pitt has always been regarded

as an excellent "school for
preparing players for the NFL. By
admitting all the in-house
findings, there can be nothing
brought up later which may
further tarnish the program.

Assistant Sports Information
Director Ron Wahl said the NCAA
may comment on Pitt’s situation
by the end ofjune. Now there is
nowhere to go but forward. The
football program is putting its
sins behind it. Its penance may
be harsh NCAA sanctions, but by
conducting such a thorough
investigation and turning its
findings over to the NCAA, Pitt is
virtually removing all skeletons
from its closet.

The university realizes the value
of the football program. When
the Panthers win, it helps bring in
more alumni support. Some of
this money does go right back
into athletics, but much ofit goes
to non—athletic parts of the
university. When Pitt goes to a
bowl game, the athletic
department makes sure Hillman

Library gets a nice donation. Next
time you look at a library book,
do not be surprised if there is a
sticker in the cover declaring it a
donation from a Pitt football bowl
team.

Also countless students come
here because Pitt has a well
known football team. The
university -realizes this; that is
why it is working so hard to
show the NCAA it wants to come
clean. Pitt’s mistakes were made
in the past, but that is just it: it is
in the past. So let’s take our
punishment and move on rather
than hide and hope no one will
find out.

It is a shame some Pitt football
fans do not realize what the
university is trying to do. They
are badsmouthing the university
for turning itself in and bad-
mouthing the local press for
opening up a can ofworms in its
own city’s school. This initial
reaction is understandable, but
time will tell — Pitt did the right
thing.

THE PI'IT NEWS, Wednesday, June 3, 1992

Blazers too hotfor Bulls to handle

By Rob Pugliese
Senior Staff Writer

Defending their NBA title has
made the Chicago Bulls, well,
pretty defensive.

Life at the top is taking its toll
on the champs, and their
occasional lapses of effort and
desire have made the road back
much more difficult than the Bulls
ever imagined. Internal bickering
surfaced after losses to Cleveland,
and whining about the officiating
has been constant.

New York and Cleveland
knocked Chicago down two or
three pegs on the vulnerability
scale, and Portland is more than
capable of having its way with
the champs. The Blazers can adapt
to any style, outgunning a high-
octane Phoenix club and muscling
with Utah to reach the finals.

This will be a hard-fought series
that should go the distance. The
Blazers have paid their dues,
matured through adversity, and
they will now claim their first
world championship in 15 years.

,Here’s a position-by—position
glance at the series matchups and
why it’s Portland in seven.

been much of a factor in the
playoffs to this point, and he
won’t start now. Kevin Duckworth
is mobile and his quickness
translates into an advantage on
the boards. Duckworth is potent
from 15 feet in with his jumper,
and enjoys an many ‘advantage
over the grizzled veteran. Edge to
PORTLAND. ,

POWER FORWARD: This
matchup is seen as pivotal — the
one that could go a long way
toward deciding the final
outcome. Horace Grant has

carried the Bulls through cold"

spells with his devastating work
on the offensive glass and
undoubtedly has been their most
consistent performer, savejordan.

Buck Williams is the man who
does all the little things for
Portland, and he matches up very

. well here. The legs and youth of

Grant against the experience and
savvy of Williams is too close to
call: EVEN.

SMALL FORWARD: Scottie
Pippen and Jerome Kersey are
clones in so many ways. Both are
6-foot, 7-inch athletic
thoroughbreds, devastating
wingmen on the break, tough
rebounders and great defenders.

However there are also key
differences. Kersey’s build and
strength make him a much more
durable player, vital in winning a
series of this magnitude. Pippen
has been the mystery man of the
playoffs. He has often dissipated
into a non-factor.

Kersey has been consistent in
every game. Kersey been
underrated his entire career, while
Pippen often gets more attention
than he deserves just because he
plays with Michael Jordan. The
desire and toughness of Kersey
will tell the story here. Slight
edge to PORTLAND.

POINT GUARD: This promises
to be a field day for Terry Porter.
His three-point rampage broke
the backs of both Phoenix and
Utah. John Paxson still sticks the
open jumper effectively and has
shown more success firing off
the dribble, but he faces a
nightmare with the versatile
Porter. Too many problems to
even discuss for Chicago; edge to
PORTLAND.

SHOOTING GUARD: The

dream scenario is reality: Jordan
and Clyde Drexler waging war.
Jordan is a one-man show again,

actually looked like a team. He
alone has brought the Bulls to the
threshold of a second title. He
will light it up, but how much
will he light up his teammates?

Clyde has an opportunity to
prove that he, not Michael, is the
MVP this year. After years of
neglect, he will take center stage
and will not disappoint. Clyde’s
steady hand will coax Portland
through tough stretches. Slight
edge here to CHICAGO.

BENCH: The Blazers wear
teams down with their bench.
Cliff Robinson is one of the most
versatile players in the game, and
Danny Ainge brings the three-
pointer and still more experience
to the floor for the Blazers.

The Chicago bench also plays
its role very well, but it can’t
inflict serious damage on a
consistent basis. Edge to
PORTLAND.

COACHING: Phil Jackson
didn’t adjust well to the superior
opposing tactics of either Pat
Riley or Lenny Wilkens. Rick
Adelman deserves credit for
melding Portland’s fr_agile
psyches, but he really hasn’t
instilled a killer instinct in them.
No advantage here: EVEN.‘

Continued from page 12
when the Pirates finally came
out on top by four games.

Last season it was the
Pirates‘ turn to pound on the
Mets..Pittsburgh dominated
its old nemesis all year..

This year both teams are
reeling from tough losses, so
the upcoming series should
be very interesting.Nearly
every game the Buccos lost
over this incredible skid was
because either the starting
rotation couldn’t get past
the fifth inning or the
bullpen couldn’t hold the
lead.

The New York fans are
booing Bobby Bonilla so
loudly that he is forced to
wear earplugs at Shea
Stadium. He is showing some
signs of life however: a
mammoth grand slam during
a 14-1 pounding of San
Francisco earned him a

curtain ‘call from the Newf

York crowd.

For the Mets to win the
upper hand against the Bucs,
Bonilla and Howardjohnson
must produce.
