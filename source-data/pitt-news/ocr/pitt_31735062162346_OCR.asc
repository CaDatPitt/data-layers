TUESDAY, IVIAY 14, ‘I974

BY BILL HADUCK
A_ $21 million redevelopment
project for the Herron Avenue area
behind Trees Hall, including both
residential and. commercial im-
provements, could become a reality
by 1977 according to the originator
of the plan, Phillip B. Anderson.-
Anderson, a Pitt undergraduate

i'('«_,majoring in urban studies, said the

1‘

main objective of theplan to clear
Herron Avenue of all structures,
replacing themwith a much needed
shopping district and modern high-
and low-rise apartment buildings.

The shopping district would
include a major department store, a
100-room motel, parking garages, a
supermarket, a movie theatre,
pharmacies, specialty shops, and
restaurants. .

The residential" areas of the site
would be cleared of 112 dilapidated.
and substandard structures, and
replaced with 16 apartment ,build-
ings with a capacity of approxi-
mately 452 units. 5» 

In addition, a combined profes-
sional ofﬁce and medical- building
would be constructed.

Although the area is centrally
locate'd for about 50,000 residents
of the upper Hill District, Anderson
noted that presently there is not a
single supermarket or pharmacy
within easy walking distance.

“It’s a great inconvenience,” he

— said. “You can’t even get aspirin if

you need  This way we’ll have
two pharmacies right in the area.”

Because much of the land under
and around Herron Avenue has
been mined, ﬁlling operations will

. have to be undertaken to prevent

subsidence problems with some of
the high rise buildings, Anderson
said.

News Analysis

The Amine subsidence problem
eliminates the possibility of gov-
ernment funding, so Anderson has
turned to private ﬁnancing for the
project. “We have a tenative
commitment from Kidder Peabody
in New York to ﬁnance the whole
package.” Anderson also noted
several local ﬁnancing companies
interested in the project, including
J.W~. Reese Company; Johnstone,
Newcomer, and Valentour; and the
ﬁrm‘ of Lorenzi, Dodds and Gunnil
Inc.

Much of the area was blighted by
the riots of the 60’s, and Anderson
said this had a part in the
reluctance to redevelop. *

“No one with any capital wanted

to go into the area and redevelop it .

right after the disturbances and so
it has stayed this way.”

An automobile tour of the project
area showed most of the buildings
abandoned and boarded up.- A few
are inhabited. V

Relocation for the people who do
live in the project site should be no
problem, according to Anderson,
because only about 15 families
would be affected. In addition,
federal law holds that relocation
funds must be made available
before any families can be forced to
move. Anderson said Kidder
Peabody would agree to such
terms. _

The shopping district would
beneﬁt a great number of people,
Anderson said. “Not only the
people on the Hill, We expect a
great influxof consumers from all
over the city. Herron and Center is
one of the busiest intersections in
the city, and in addition, Herron

Resignation Would Create Problems

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

It has been a year now since.

President Nixon’s Watergate
troubles spurned initial, perhaps
premature and unfounded, calls for
his resignation. Those bids were
scoffed at by the country's
conservative establishment, while
the liberals then passed them off as
wishful thinking.

But the events of the year, and-

especially of the past week, have
transformed the attitude: It is now
the conservatives, led by ranking
Republicans in Congress, who call
on the President to step aside.
And it was apparently those
Republicans now outspoken on the

. subject of resignation that caused

the ﬂurry of rumors which swept
the capital Friday -of the Presi-

. dent's possibly‘ imminent resig_na_- “

Following the release of the
Watergate transcripts by the White
House May 1, and. the subsequent
scrutiny of them by the Congress
last week, support for the
President--hitting a peak just
before the weekend--virtuallyedied
out, thus leading many Capitol Hill
observers to believe that the
President might resign soon.
“People who have supported
Nixon all the way down the line are
now turning away from him--some
have even called for resignation,"
said one Senate aide. “This is
having a great impact.” -
The aide particularly referred_to
the onslaught of criticism which
was ‘directed at the’ President by
Republicans in Congress Friday.

Senate Council Concern

BY GENE GRABOWSKI
_ Many objections about recom-
mendations in the Chancellor’s
Tenure Commission Report were
voiced at yesterday’s University
Senate Council meeting. Speaking
for the Senate Committee’ on
Tenure and Academic Freedom,

_ William Brown said he, was

concerned over changes proposed
in the report affecting the “very
nature of tenure." ‘

Charging the Report was “lack-
ing in balance and sensitivity”
toward faculty members, Brown
advocated a substantial revision of
the Tenure Commission Report so
as to mitigate the threat to tenure
and academic freedom. ‘

“We must continue to have

Thursday  

evening, about 200 mailers voted to
accept the new contract which
involved terms of attrition ‘due ‘to
automation, wages and fringe
beneﬁts.

“We won’t have a paper out
until Wednesday, maybe Thurs-
day, because of the preparatory
work we have to do,” Feigel said,
“but we’re definitely returning to
work tomorrow.”

The paper handlers are the only
union to remain unsettled but they
are expected to take a ratiﬁcation
vote today,’ according to the
Associated Press." Ofﬁcers of that
union reached a tenative agree-
ment Saturday, with the Pittsburgh
Press Co. who owns both the Press

and the Post-Gazette. -

A statement issued by the Press
soon after the printers’ and

newsstands Wednesday night. The
statement said the first edition of
the Press would come out Thursday
afternoon. Although the statement
seemed very optimistic, it conclu-
ded, “barring further labor prob-.
Iems.”

The Press released no further
details, but Feigel said the printers
settled for the same package as the
Teamsters. ‘ The Teamsters, in
addition to an improved wage and

Myslinski’ Denies
Student Ticl<et Fee
For '74 Football

1/

BY GENE GRABOWSKI

Athletic Director Casmir Myslin-
ski denied Friday that Pitt students
would have to pay to attend home
football ‘ games. ‘

The rumor that students would
have to buy tickets to see Johnny
Major's Panthers swept the

campus after the team’s highly I’

successful campaign. Students
feared the administration would
attempt to capitalize on the team’s
popularity by charging" them
admission to the games.

Myslinski dispelled the rumor 

saying “This is the first time I’ve
heard of any such idea. Nothing of
this nature has been discussed in
the Athletic Department.”

Some students were also con-
cerned over the possibility of a
reduction in student seats at Pitt-
Stadium. The seats, it was
rumored, would accomodate pay-
ing customers instead. Myslinski
also denied this rumor. “I haven’t
heard anything about reduction of

seats, either,” he said. “As far as '

I know, the student section twill
remain the same size as last year.”

According to Myslinski, students
will still be admitted to home
football, games free if they show

their ID cards and validation cards» »

at one of the student gates. x

“Damn! Gotta sign in just to
check my mailbox? This is crazy.”

That's what many students have
to say about the added security
precautions now enforced in the
Towers Lobby.

In an effort to reduce crime in the
dormitories, the Towers security
force is operating on a 24 hour
basis. Anyone passing through an
inner door to either Tower B or C
(Tower A is closed for the Summer)
must sign his name at the security
desk in front of the door.

Only resident students who have

i the required orange sticker on their
, ID cards can pass freely through

the lobby area. At all times of the
day or night, non-resident guests
must telephone their hosts from the
security desks for permission to

« visit.

M “It won’t hurt the Oakland area,
either. There’ll be some family
type sit-down restaurants, which
Oakland lacks." '

Because of its location, Anderson
said the area is a “sound
investment," for redevelopment.
He admitted that private financing
would not make a great profit in a
short time by funding the project.
but said, “Finance has a respon-
sibility to meet the people's needs.
This proposal will give them a
chance to exercise it.”

is required to sign in at two security
desks if he wishes to see a Tower C
resident. _

Many students and guest are
bewildered by these inconven-
iences and wonder if they will
continue through the Fall.

Assistant Ho'using Director Don-
ovan Hughes said the added
security is only a Summer
experiment. “_We’re running a test
period to see the reaction, of
residents and what police reports
will show," he said. '“To the best
of my knowledge, no decision will
be made about permanent 24-hour
security until late this Summer."

Residence Life Co-ordinator
Marian E. Hirst, also said the
program is experimental and
added, “Personally, I think the
extra security is a good idea.”

The new precautions’may be
inconvenient, but security they
offer is high. There has been no
report of a single crime in. the
Towers since the 24-hour security
program went into effect more than
three weeks ago.

‘Obscene’ April Issue

BY CATHY TUTTLE

Freedom of the press became an
issue at‘ Dusquesne Un.iversity this
spring when the campus news-
paper, The Dusquesne Duke,
appeared before the University’s
Student Judiciary Board to defend
the content of their April Fool’s
edition.

Charges of “lewd, obscene, and L

perverse" were leveled by
Dusquesne student Joel Klein
against the Duke’s gag issue, “The
daily nancy." ‘

Editor Jim Hosek admitted,
“The paper was rather crude at

- times. But it was supposed to be

mainly humorous. The real issue
was whether or not the school
should be" able to censor us.”

Duquesne Vice President for
Student Services Darrel Rishel
argued student— publications
should, “Not be censored, but we
should hold them accountable for
actions that are slanderous, libel-
ous or grossly inappropriate. The
April Fools’ issue was inappropri-
ate, racist in nature, and had a lot
of what could only be labeled as
‘sick-sex’.”

Rishel emphasized Dusquesne
was a religiously affiliated school
and as such had an obligation of
moral teaching and conduct, and
“regulation of moral activities.”

To regulate the moral activity of
the paper, and insure against
further papers of this type, Rishel
proposed forming a publications
board, which “would act as a check
on student publications. Certainly
there was never any idea of
censorship. Of course,” he
continued, “if they want to be
totally free, they have to .be
ﬁnancially independent.”

During the April 25 trial before
the Student Judiciary Board, Hosek
claims Rishel used‘ the‘ opportunity
to “push for a publications board.”
The publications board, Hosek
said,‘ “would have the power to
pick and choose editors, to decide
editorial policy. It’s crazy to say

they wouldn’t be censoring us.”

Duquesne’s Dean of Students
Office also used thetrial as an
opportunity to take a stand against
the paper, Hosek said. He asserts
the Office, along with the Office of
Student Services, pressured Klein
into bringing charges against the
paper.

“When they, (the Dean of
Students Ofﬁce) should not have
taken_a stand, they did. Patricia

_ the administration’s_

Watt, Dean of Students, testified in
behalf of the plaintiff. That is a
definity conflict of interest.”
Watt's assisstant, George A

Preisinger, tried to answer some of
the charges. “While the n ws-
paper is the voice of the students, if
we finance it, it is the responsibility
of the University,” he said.

Preisinger continued, “the pub-
lications board and the April Fool’s
edition of the Duke are two

separate issues, but it’s difficult to
separate the two. Should there be
a publications board? I don’t
know...l don’t know. A student
paper, when it is a part of the
University should be held account-
able to someone. If the students
can’t take their responsibilities for
the paper seriously,'then maybe
authority
should be exercised.” A
Claiming the paper “seemed to
feel it was immune from libel
charges just because it was part of
the University,” Preisinger noted_
the job of his office was “to alert
students to their responsibilities.”
Hosek found mixed reactions to
his paper. “Some of my teachers
used a whole class period to lecture
about how bad it was. Some
students liked it, obviously, others
didn’t. United Press lntemational
[UPI] was going to run a story on
us. And Dan Rather called about
the trial.” '
Encouraged by the paper’s
acquittal on all charges, Hosek still
felt an April Fool’s issue would not
be published in the future. “We
worked all year to build credibility
for the paper, only to see it
destroyed by that one issue.”

 Resignation Would Create Problems

/,

(Continued from Page 1)
disapproval was Senator Richard
Schweiker of Pennsylvania, a
candidate for reelection this year.

“I am compelled to speak out,"
Schweiker said in calling on Nixon
to resign. “I cannot remain silent
in the face of this now obvious
moral corrosion destroying and
debasing the Presidency."

But all the reports of resignation
were strictly rumor, according to
many sources at the Capital,
apparently motivated by the
collapse of Republican support for
the President and other speculative
observations of the President’s
behavior in the past few days.
They were probably not, the
sources said, originated at the
White House.

Nevertheless, the rumors have
raised questions about the conse-
quences of a Presidential resigna-’
tion. Technically, the consequence
of utmost importance to the
American people would be that
Vice President Gerald R. Ford
would assume duties as President.

Philosophically, it has been

~widely argued by scholars that a

Presidential resignation might
have two negative effects: 1) leave
a sense ‘ of illegitimacy among
Nixon's staunch supporters that
the President had been forced out
of office by his political opponents
setting a dangerous precedent for
future unpopular presidents, and;
2) deny the nation of the
constitutional process of impeach-
ment, the remedy set forth by the

Founding Fathers to rid the nation K

of unfit leaders.

But after a resignation, the
consequences for private citizen
Richard Nixon could be equally
damaging. Unless he was granted
immunity from prosecution by
Congress, the ex-President could
be indictedfor various charges
stemming from. Watergate and
other scandals which have rocked
his administration in the past year.

According to an article in the
New York Times, there are some
portions in the Nixon transcripts
which would appear central to an
investigation.

The Times writer cited United
States Code, Section 1505, which
states it is an obstruction of justice

to “influence, intimidate, or‘
impede," any witness at a
Congressional investigation and
applied this to a White House
conversation in which Nixon told
John W. Dean III, his special
counsel, not to'worry about an
investigation being considered in
the House Banking and Currency
Committee and a Senate Judiciary
subcommittee. '
.Another incident concerned a
conversation which shows that
Dean warned the President on
March 21, 1973 that Howard Hunt,
a convicted -Watergate burglar, had
threatened to reveal seamy activi-
ties relating to the White House

, unless he continued to receive hush

money. For 90 minutes Nixon
considered options for dealing with
the threat, the report said. u p
The Times writer indicated this
may be an obstruction of justice, in
accordance with United States
Code Section 1510, which declares:
whoever willfully endeavors by
means of bribery, misrepresenta-
tion, intimidation, or force or
threats thereof to obstruct, delay or
prevent the communication of
information relating to a violation
of any criminal statute of the
United States by any person to a

criminal investigator, “can be
prosecuted for obstruction of
justice.

And as Anthony Lewis of the

‘New York Timesirecently pointed

out, Nixon as a private citizen could
be sued or asked to testify in a
large number of ordinary damage
suits, on a wide range of subjects.
It appears certain that whether or
not the President is impeached and
convicted, or resigns, his legal fees
are likely to be astronomical.
Immunity presents its problems
also. As Lewis pointed out, “What
about ‘the men who have pleaded
guilty and are awaiting sen-.
tencing--Jeb Magruder and John
Dean. for example--should they.
still go to jail?" And the list does
not end with Dean and Magruder--
there are literally scores of men
involved in the Watergate scan-
dals. Immunity, too, would
somehow leave the feeling of

incompleteness that the nation had -

been deprived of the judicial
process as it had been deprived of
the constitutional process of
impeachment when the President
resigned in the first place.

But while it is, at best, only
possible President Nixon would
resign after the widespread fallout
of Republican support, its scenario
was ‘aptly offered yesterday by a
Senate aide: “In a city like this
there are so many rumors that you
don't take anything -seriously until
it happens.”

“But," she continued, ‘_‘he could
resign tomorrow."

increase. Smith also announced a
small cost of living increase of $75
per term for teaching assistants

-and teaching fellows.

. Smith said the University was
asking for $58.9 million in’ State
Appropriations for the coming
year. President of Senate Council,
Dr. Robert Newman elaborated on
this point: “The attitude of the
State inquisitors has improved
enormously. While we probably
won't get all of the $58.9 million,
we'll probably get most of the
funds we asked for." A‘

In an official statement concern-
ing the financial situation of
Lawrenceville’s Arsenal ‘Family

and Children’s Center, Smith said,
“We will continue our faculty
support of Arsenal, but financially
we cannot, make up the deﬁcit of
about $80-100,000." Smith added
if outside institutionsoffer temp-
orary financial help until perma-
nent funding is available, then
Arsenal will survive.

Provost Rescues. CIC  

From Possible Extinction

BY CATHY TUTTLE
Funding from the Provost’s

Office has alleviated the threat‘of ~

extinction facing the University's
Citizen Information Center (CIC).

CIC director Vic Papale said he
presented “good programs and a
very low budget ofﬁce. At least 12
organizations petitioned for us to
remain open. That is probably why
we were slated to stay open.”

Assistant to the Provost Ray
Steele, said the University was in
the midst of deciding which
organizations the school can afford,
and which will have to be
terminated.

Steele said, “We're making
some hard-nosed decisions now.
Which organizations provide useful
services and which ones don’t?
We're only getting so many dollars
a year from the government. We
have to make cuts in the budget.
Since our mission is mainly
academic, we haveto take a-hard
look at peripheral groups like CIC.
The question we will be looking at
continuously is do they serve the
University?” _.

State President of the College
Young Democrats and former
employee of CIC, Betty Nelson,
stressed the importance of the
Center. “It provides students with

Senate Council

that his intent to curtail student
questioning at the meeting was
entirely misunderstood. “The
discussion became too much of'an
inquisition,” he said. “We were
wasting time on an issue that
should have been discussed at a
meeting between the administra-
tion and the students."

In further Council action, Chair-
man of Student Affiars William
Lenaghen asked for faculty input
'on a future security system for the

CIC is open daily for questions
concerning political candidates and

addition to providing political

Voters Guide twice a year, and

holds voter registration. Offices

In 1970, after the Kent State
shootings and other student dis-
turbances, CIC was established by
the University Senate to “channel
student energies into productive
political activities," Nelson said,

Although many universities set I

up similar organizations in 1970,
CIC is one of the few remaining
information centers of _its kind.
Nelson said, “Through its non-
partisan stance, the CIC has kept
the issues clear. The former

 Resignation Rumors

At one time the resignation of President Nixon might have been an
-acceptable response to the revelations of the Watergate incident and
other scandals, which have rocked the nation in the last year.
However, with the opening of the impeachment proceedings in the
House Judiciary Committee the resignation of the President will thwart
.the constitutional processes of government.
Many newspapers, such as the Miami Herald, the Chicago Tribune,
and the Cleveland Plain Dealer have recently called for Nixon’s

resignation, so the nation can avoid the spectacle of impeachment-

proceedings in the Congress. In an editorial last Sunday, the New York.
Times reiterated that the President might resign because he is “no
longer in a moral position” to lead the 

Edward Brooke was the ﬁrst Republican senator to call for Nixon’s
resignation. Since then James Buckley of the Conservative Party said
the President would do the nation a favor if he resigned. Last Friday
Pennsylvania Senator Richard S. Schweiker could not “remain silent in
the face of the now obvious moral corrosion destroying and
‘embarassing the Presidency,” and urged the President to resign.
Others such as House Republican Leader John Rhodes and Senator
Marlow Cook of Kentucky have suggested the President seriously
consider resigning. ' ’ ‘ .

Senator Milton Young, Republican of North Dakpta has suggested
the President step aside, invoking the 25th Amendment to the
Constitution because it “would be a whole lot easier for members of
Congress and myself if he used the 25th amendment and stepped aside
until this thing is cleared up.” _

It goes without saying that the power of Nixon as President has
disintegrated and that he lacks the moral authority to lead ‘the nation.
If anything, the released transcripts of the Watergate conversations
have made perfectly clear to all Americans, including some of the
President’s staunchest supporters.

. Even Senator Barry Goldwater has  the President will
resign if the House votes a bill of impeachment “rather than let the
countrybedraggedthroughtwoorthreemonths ofterrorinaSenate

trial.” With so many Republicans deserting the President, the
resignation of the President is a real possibility which cannot be
dismissed too lightly. j_

Undoubtedly, the President’s handling of the Watergate issue, and
the actual scandals themselves, have damaged the Presidency and
Americans’ sense of their political system. The American people have
lost conﬁdence in their political leaders or the political system. The
resignation of the President will only serve to reinforce that
dissatisfaction.

The Constitution declares only one means of removing a Presidentif
he has committed high crimes and misdemeanors, and that is
impeachment and not resignation. -

As expressed by Senator Young, Nixon’s resignation or invoking of
the 25th amendment and stepping aside temporarily will save many
congressmen from making a decision on the question of impeachment.
But this is an illegitimate rationale for calling for Nixon’s resignation,
since congressmen unwilling to accept the responsibilities of their

A "offices in accordance with the Constitution should not be holding those

offices. It is time for the resignation requests to stop.

The resignation of the President would ‘cheapen the political
processes of the American democracy. If the President is removed it
should be by the will and constitutional power of the Congress.

An exercise of these political processes in full view of the American
people will not be terrorizing, as Goldwater said, but revitalizing. It
will prove to the people of the country that their governnnnent can work,
will work, and is working. It will restore the faith.

Heyoo!

BY W. JACK ROMBERG.

There is a theoretical organiza-
tion in the United States called the
electorate. As good citizens and
potential voters we are all members
of this figmentation. _

Since the appearance of political

parties, American politicians have‘

viewed the electorate as a huge
clumsy beast that must be fed,
watered, placated, and sometimes
housetrained. Each year the
electorate responds by installing
into office those politicians which
best represent their ideal of the
American dream.

The electorate is composed of a
diverse ‘array of personalitites,
from ivory tower liberals and
bl’eary-eyed youth to thesouthern
redneck, all equally susceptible to
the massive ad campaign‘ which
characterizes our yearly tribute to
commercialism.

Such are American elections, a
conglomeration of selling tech-
niques cleverly designed to make
Americans think they are making
their own choices.

The media, true. to the tenets of
modern technology, plays its role in
this annual spectacle, by predicting
the winners through a number of
“key" districts. Since their
accuracy rate is wel_l over 90
percent, this renders the votes of
thousands of people meaningless.

Many voters, accepting the tide of
the times, wait until the first

\ predictions come out, an hour

before the polls close,‘ before

Sexism

Dear Editor:

This is in. answer to absolutely
nothing but a revolting situation on
this campus. This situation is the
one in which we, as students, are
placed because we are considered
by the benevolent policy-makers of
institution to be immature
imbeciles who have no idea what to
do with academic freedom in a
“learning" experience. As a result
we ﬁrst, are not expected (nor
allowed) to demand anything in

' particular of an instructor to fulfill

what we may seek in academic
expression; and second, after we

deciding to vote. A logical
continuation of the development
of American elections points to an
interesting scenario.

Imagine now, elections in the
year 2000. Political parties have

been done away with as being an '

ineffective means of reaching the
people. Instead, the three major
networks, ABC, NBC, and CBS

each run their own candidates for

municipal, state, and federal
offices. This would increase the
political awareness of those mil-
lions of viewers who are glued to
the television.

For the housewives, soap operas
would no longer consist of the same
old “Tom loves Jane who loves
Dick who loves Harry” sort of story
line. Rather, the toils and
tribulations of a chief executive
would gain popularity.

Consider the effect on those
myriads of football fans, when, in
the middle of Monday night
football they hear, “Look at that
Kansas City line, folks, they’re fat!
They’re out of shape! But they are
all voting for me, Howard Cosell for
senator...” "

‘The need for political patron
drives would no longer exist.
Instead, each network would seek
sponsers for their individual
candidates. For example, Pepsi
Cola, Adorn, and Chevrolet might

' decide to support ABC’s candidate

and advertise for them. Companies
would have the choice of suppor-
ting individual candidates or the
networks‘ entire slate. '

To The

“buy” our position in a classroom,
and pay for the service‘ of an
instructor, the instructor is given
“academic freedom” and we are
subject to her or his whims.

Therefore, I maintain that my
freedom of '. expression and aca-
demic exploration :has repeatedly
been suppressed by instructors at
Pitt, not because it was irrelevant
or not educational [academic] but
because of the personal prejudices
of the instructors in question. That

prejudice was in response to myself _,

as a woman challenging sexism and
as a lesbian challenging sexist bias.
t Furthermore, my relationship to
the

 Right of Free Press

press is accountable to its readers and not to admini/strators.
Furthermore, Rishel argues that the administration has an obligation

The recent controversy stemming from the publication of an April
‘Fools’ issue of the Duke at Duquesne University threatens to deny the
editors of the campus newspaper their right to continue as a free and
independent press responsible only to its readers.

The editors of the Duke appeared before the Student Judicial Board
on charges of being “lewd, obscene, and perverse." but were
acquitted on all charges. Dr. Darrel Rishel, Vice-President for Student
Services indicated at the hearings a board was needed to act as a check
on student publications. _

A newspaper is guaranteed the nights ofa free press whether it is a
campus newspaper fnmded either through Student Government or the
administration, or a completely independent paper funded with ad

revenue. This is a right guaranteed by the Constitution, and not a

privilege granted by university administrators.
V However, administrators are in unique positions to infringe on those
guaranteed rights. But any suggestion by an administrator to regulate
the press is unjustiﬁed-even if done in an attempt to serve the interests
of the community.

Obviously, the purpose of the proposed publications, board at
Duquesne IS directed at holding the paper accountable for actions
termed nnappropriateby Rishel. What Rishel fails to realize is the

institution as a consumer-

to regulate the moral activity of the paper because the school is
religiously afﬁliated. Eeedom of the press is non-sectarian. The

0 Constitution of the United States is applicable to all innstitutions, both

public and private, religiously affiliated or unaﬂiliated. An attempt to
invoke religious affiliation as reason to censor the press is an insult to
the very basis on which this nation was fomnded.

The idea of a publications board to censor the press should be
abandoned. The Duquesne Duke should be allowed to operate without
administrative censorship, since administrative control -is no different
from government control of the national press.

Thomas Jefferson summarized the issue of the free press best when
he wrote. “Were it left for me to decide whether we should have a
government without newspapers, or newspapers without a
government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.”

If it is a question of choosing between administrators who propose
publication boards designed to censor the press or the existence of the
Duquesne Duke as an independent force on campus, we must
overwhelmingly support the Constitution’s First Amendment right of
press freedom. 0 ‘ '

Elections In The Year 2000 

Furthermore, networks could
gain exposure for their candidates
by giving them guest slots in prime , 
time television series. This would
eliminate the need for Gallup polls.

Political analysts could rely solely
on Neilsen ratings.

With the advent of television if
campaigns, there would be no ugly, 
fat, or dull candidates with high
squeaking voices. The typical 
candidate would look like Robert
Redford, have the wit of Mark
Twain, and a voice like Bing
Crosby.

Also, there would be a revolution
in political slogans. If, for
example, "Johnny Carson were to
run for President, his campaign
slogan would merely by “Heyoo!”

Finally, election day would be
radically changed because the
accuracy of computer predictions
would reach its pinnacle. One
random voter would be selected 

answer a series of “questions
concerning the products he and his * '-
family use, and what sort of shows
they watch. The answers would be
fed into a computer which analyzes
them and announces the will of the
American public in a free and open
election.

This futuristic election system is
not only more efficient and
economic, but more honest too.
Political corruption would be :
minimized. After all, if you can't

decisions of instructors by‘ virture

of the instructors role, so we are in ,
a position’ to be intellectually 
oppressed, and become peons in an l
economic relationship which we i

should have a role in controlling. ‘

My call to action is that students ’
must assume responsibility for V,‘
submissing to that role and actively "
ﬁght for control over the academic
situation and end our submissive-
ness. Students must be sensitized
to the fact that if they think they are
being handed “crap” in a
classroom, it is crap that they are 
buying and should demand free- ' 
dom of expression in the class-
room, and the same “academic
freedom” given to instructors. ,
‘That we shouldphave the right to ‘
challenge material given in the 1'
class (and therefore explore our
inherent thought processes) with-
out fear of the instructor-controlled
grade.’ To implement that there
must be a way for students to
challenge instructor’s practices and
be taken seriously, which means
that students basically can no
longer be considered immature
imbeciles, and must be treated as
consumers with a right to control
the economic and academic rela- ,
tionship. '

Dear Editor:

lmplicit in the concept of
so-called “course evaluation,"
which in actual practice is also
professor—evaluative, is the pre-
mise that all things can be
quantified according to precise
measurements. Obviouslycertain
features such as height, weight.
distance, can be precisely quanti-
fied. But is it really sensible to
believe that teaching performance
and the learning experience can be
meaningfully reduced to a few
mathematical ﬁgures on a page in
some “course evaluation report?"
Upon reflection, no. Upon
reflection, the basic premise upon
which course evaluation is predic-
ted is seen to be faulty’.

Learning is essentially a quality
of experiencefxand being such, it
cannot be meaningfully reduced to
and expressed in a few cold ﬁgures
on a piece of dry paper.

One might--to use an analogy--
say that it is 80 degrees outside;
that is a measurement of tempera-
ture. But if one says he is enjoying
the pleasant weather, that is a
quality of experience and cannot
truly be meaningfully reduced to
figures. ’

Likewise, the qualities of the
experience of learning, of impart-

set forth in figures.

Course evaluation booklets can-
not really be taken seriously to be
actually accomplishing what they

stimulating?

attempt to do.

Course evaluation studies have,
however, achieved things their
ardent advocates have not openly
asserted; course evaluation studies
at the University of Pittsburgh have
greased the palms and lined the
pockets of students‘ who have
involved themselves with them.
Course evaluation money has been
used, not to evaluate courses, but
to pay for jet plane rides and
salaries and other gratuities for
students involved with course
evaluation. To read former
Undergraduate Academic Review
[course evaluation] Kingpin Rude
Portenzone’s letter in a March
edition of the Pitt News, one would
think that course evaluation work
was a selfless act upon the part of
self-sacrificing students. However,
a careful evaluation of the would-be.
evaluators shows that they have
done rather well for themselves
monetarily--and this is something
that can be meaningfully expressed
in precise figures, in terms of
dollars and cents. '

Prior to Rudi Portenzone’s
involvement in course evaluation
work, the students who involved
themselves in it did so without the
desire to benefit’ themselves
monetarily. :With the coming of
Rudi Portenzone, all this changed.
Rudi Portenzone, Miss Stackhouse,
and others. began the unprece-

dented practice of paying them- \

selves salaries out of student funds
earmarked for course evaluation,
and buying themselves‘ jet plane
tickets so they could fly back and
forth from home and other places.

And, what is truly interesting about
the matter is that all this
unprecedented spending‘ of money
to benefit the course evaluation

I

personnel did not contribute to
more efficiency on the part of the
evaluators. In fact, efficiency flew
to the wind when Portenzone and
Company wasted over $2,000 in
1970 by fouling up the printing and
mail—out operation aspect of the
Undergraduate Academic Review.
Also, Portenzone attempted with
conspicuous gall and near success
to have the Undergraduate Aca-
demic Review course evaluation
‘booklet declared a permanent‘
campus publication so he could
claim special scholarship beneﬁts
for himself. Such a patent high
self—serving move had never even
been contemplated by prior course
evaluation staff.

If thegcourse evaluation advo-
cates are so enthralled by the use of
ﬁgures, perhaps they should do a
little booklet listing precise ﬁgures
in dollars and cents regarding how
much students and others involved
in course evaluation have monetar-

-ilxheneﬁtted lytheir involvement.

To‘ be for something out of

sincerity is commendable. But to ‘

be for something out of ostensibly
high-sounding but false reasons
which cover up ulterior and selfish
motives ‘is * reprehensible. '

Dear Editor, 1

We would like to comment‘ on the
current debate regarding the use of
the Biology 138 textbook, Man and
the Environment. .

While maintaining a thin facade of
scientific neutrality on social
questions. the book asserts that the

world is_overpopulated and that the -

"colored peoples" of theworld are

 

primarily responsible for the
population. problem. It further
states that the poverty of Black,
Brown. Red and Yellow people is
due to ignorant habits of breeding
too many children rather. than to
the systematic racial and economic
oppression that they suffer.

These assertions lay the ground-‘

work for proposing racist measures
to control the population of
oppressed peoples such as forced
sterilization. chemical treatment of
the drinking water in poor
communities and using economic
reprisals against mothers who
“bear too many children." These

measures are characterized, among ’

other things. by their denial of

. womens' rights to autonomy‘ over

their reproductive systems as well
as their genocidal purpose.

This attempt to legitimize racism
is only one instance of a stepped-up
drive of attacks on Black youth that
have been characterized by budget
cutbacks, "restrictions placed upon
admissions and the recent speaking
tours of Jensen and Shockley.

institution of capitalist society.

concrete visual image that film or
TV would present is bound to be
disappointing. What takes place in
the imagination 'of the audience
turns out to be much more. scary
than the dull reality of actual
experience. The idea of a
supernatural evil unleashed upon
the world hits an audience harder
than some celluloid vision of
mechanical monsters uprooting the
Empire State Building. ’'

The success of a show like CBS .

Radio Mystery Theater shows the
incredible potential for radio as a
medium. Radio does not have to be
a barrage of easy listening, ‘hit
parade and advertising. It can be a
valid art form. The revival of radio
drama may indicate an interesting

‘future ‘for the medium.

The idea of something to sit
down and listen to. rather than as
background noise. is a novelty for
our generation. since weare the TV
Kids. People tend to rely on their
visual perceptions too heavily.

I Radio gives them a chance’ to get

into aural effects.

So if you're looking for some
weird escapist entertainment. tune
in to WWSW at 10:07 some
weekday evening. You may waste
a few brain cells. but it's still better
for you than television.

The new programming schedule
for Fall I974 seems to be

jam-packed with the typical vio-.

tunately. carbon-copies. no matter.

how pale. of the high-quality The

Waltons and the sickening Apple’s

Way. . t

Starting with Friday nights, the
networks have almost revamped
the entire _evening. Considering
what they left ‘there, it’s a shame
they didn’t go all the way. NBC,
the big loser on this night last year,
will probably sink again. Its hopes
ride on the continued success of
Sanford and Son--their other
offerings consisting of four spinoffs
from other series: Chico and the
Man. Sunshine. A Second Start,
and Police Woman.

Chico and the Man concerns the
relationship of a chicano mechanic
and an old white garage owner.
Sunshine is a spinoff from the CBS
cheapo-rip deal Love Story of the
same name. A Second Start spun
off from Medical Center, deals with
an insurance broker who decides to
become a doctor.
at 10:00 is a cloudy reflection of
NBC‘s Tuesday-night Police Story.

CBS adds ‘two new situation
comedies on Friday. as well as
keeping its movie at 9. The
sacrificial lamb up against Sanford
and Son is The Love Nest about a
seventy-year old couple living in a
Florida trailer camp. Following at

’7:30 is We'll Get By, which deals
with a family_barely managing to
survive in urban New Jersey.

Meanwhile. ABC brings in three
new series while keeping the
noxious tiseudo-science-fiction. Six

Violinist Isaac Stern will make
his 16th. subscription concert
appearance with the Pittsburgh

Symphony at Heinz Hall May 17,.

The program consists of five
works by modern and classical
composers. The Orchestra will
perform Mozart’s Symphony No.
29 in A Major, “Miroirs” by
Kelterborn, and Five Pieces for
Orchestra by Arnold Schoenberg.
This will be the Pittsburgh

Police Woman, ~

, 281-5000 for

Million Dollar Man at 8:30.
Leading off at 8:00 for ABC is
Kodiak, starring,Clint (Cheyenne)
Walker as an Alaskan cop in a
frigid version of Adam-12. At 9:30
comes The Texas Wheelers, with
Jack Elam as a freeloader-father of
a group of “lovable Texan
vagabonds." Oh. ,well...

ABC closes out the night with
what I think has the potential to be
a big hit--Kolchack: The Night
Stalker. with Darren McGavin in
the title role. He plays the role of
Kolchack, an investigator-reporter
whose speciality is the occult.
McGavin created the role in two
excellent made-for-TV movies; The
Night Stalker and The Night Killer.
It has the potential to be a big hit,
but ABC, in its infinite wisdom,
placed it in the worst time slot
possible.

NBC continues its present
schedule on Saturdays, while CBS
adds one new comedy and ABC
revamps its whole schedule. The
Paul Sand Show is the new CBS
entry. replacing M*A*S*H which
goes back to Sunday. Sand plays

BY BRUCE IRVING

Almost all rock bands can be
classified as one of two main types.
The first is characterized by slick
technical proficiency and the ability
to make music with a machine-like
precision. Yes and Three Dog
Night are prime examples of this
emphasis. and the lack of spontan-
eity they usually display makes
their concerts predictable and often
dull. The second type, exempliﬁed
by groups like Slade and Ten Years
After. sacrifice musical quality in
an’ all-out effort to generate.
excitement.

It is a rare group _that can

_ combine these qualities in the right

proportions, and the Eaglesare
just such a band. Their Syria
Mosque concert last Thursday
night was as musically impressive
as it was fun; they delighted their
enthusiastic audience for nearly-
two hours. I
The concert.opened with an

acoustic set from Jeff Comonor, a
young singer from Los Angeles.
He was ‘followed by Jesse Collin
Youngand his band. Young, best
known for
Youngbloods. played a varied
assortment .of music including
folkish ballads, rag-like numbers
and some up-tempo blues flavored
material. His band was tight and
versatile; the piano player and
ﬂute/sax player were especially
impressive. A standing ovation
brought the band back for an
encore of ‘-‘Let Your Light Shine,"
the spirited title song from Young’s
newest album.

‘ “Take It Easy." the Eagles‘ 1972 .1

debut single, got the main
attraction off to a rousing start.
Incredibly smooth harmonies came

1 rolling through the sound system

while the solid, churning beat “had
the audience moving from the‘
start. Glen Frey moved from guitar
to piano to sing .“Outlaw Man,"
which featured extended lead work

from Bernie Leadon and new Eagle '

Don Felder. ‘J

“Already Gone ’ was the first of
tunes from their new
Asylum album On the Border.
While not as immediately appeal-
ing as their debut album, nor as
interesting thematically as Desper-

his years with thei

ado. On the Border is a strong
album that further establishes the

'Eagles as versatile writers and‘

performers and will hopefully
remove the early label of “country-
rock band.” While still providing a

Bassist Randy Meisner deserves
mention here for the solid bottom
lines which helped make these
rockers work, as-we_ll as for the
superb high harmonies he provided
throughout.

   
 
  
  

Henley. somewhat burned out after
two hours of playing. talked about
their music and themselves. The
rigors of touring were brought up
first by Frey who said "After thirty
days of this. you find yourself

few soft ballads, the up-tempo '

material is most prominent. The
rock songs are unmistakably rock,
and clearly show, both on record
and on stage, that the Eagles can
boogie with the best of them.

Acoustic guitars came out for
“Doolin Daltins," “Tequila Sun-
rise" and “Train Leaves Here This
Morning." The harmonies on the
last song were particularly beau-
tiful. Nostalgia was the keyword in
‘‘Ol' 55" and Frey dedicated it to
“everybody whoever stayed up all
night trying to get laid and failed."

Bernie Leadon's banjo virtuosity
was displayed on two bluegrass
flavored 1 instrumentals which also
featured Felder's mandolin. "The
banjo remained ‘out for “Early
Bird." a good transition to the
band's heavier material. “James
"Dean." later described as "a
period piece whose whole point is
the idea of idol worship," and
“Good Day In Hell," a rocker,from
the new album, brought the
audience to their feet.

talking about the music business in

very long, although people such as

Joni Mitchell and Paul Simon (both -

see it all as some kind of game, but
now that it's our profession we find

Correction

The Pitt News incorrectly stated

‘ in an editorial on May 7 entitled

Council Without Ears. that Dr.
Edward Blake moved discussion be
closed on childcare programs at the
Senate Council meeting to discuss
faculty salaries. Blake's first name
is David and not Edward as stated.

 

Monday's lunch hour crowd was
a mixed bag of conservative
husinessnicn. elderly shoppers.
and wandering college students
and secretaries. The one hour and
fifty minute concert consisted of
huge doses of progressive rock.
with emphasis on recent Deep
Purple album cuts.

Though they were enthusias-
tically received, Harombee’s per-
formance could best be described
as lackluster. Lengthy guitar solos
and stumbling vocal arrangements
forced many experienced rock-and-
roll enthusiasts to leave the concert

early.

The \one highlight of the

performance was a surprisingly
excellent rendition of,Joe Cocker's
version of “With  Little Help
From My Friends." in which lead
singer Ken Coey literally became
Joe Cocker.

   

At times, Coey’s imitation of
Cocker became so realistic that one
member of the crowd commented,
“He looks like Joe Cocker doing a
terrible imitation of Joe Cocker.”
Perhaps the value of this profun-
dity will never be totally under-
stood.

As a group. Horombee has been
in existence for over four years. but
a list of group members is
worthless. The group has
undergone more metamorphosis in
the past couple of years than a
stuttering butterfly.

In an interview after the concert.
lead singer Coey emphasized that
the group would continue doing the
"Free Concerts in the Park" series
until the group “made it."

At least in this reporter's
opinion, the best way for Coey to
achieve this success ispto get rid of
Harombee and go on tour
alone...perhaps as Joe Cocker.

1 Pia. Baseball Team  

 W/inning Year

BY JOHN C. BLACKBURN
Prideiwill be on the line as the
Pitt baseball team concludes its
1974 season with three games this
week. The Panthers play a
doubleheader at Clarion today and
finish with, a singletonzat Kent
State tomorrow.
-Coach Bob Lewis and his players
know they are gunning for Pitt’s
eighth straight winning season.

b However, they entered the trip

with a record of four wins and six
losses, needing a perfect week to
keep the streak alive. '

“We’re going to take a good shot
at it,” Lewis said, “but it’ll be
tough. We have to face Clarion
pitcher Pete Vukovich, and he's
about the best in the area.”

For a change, the Panthers will
have a little momentum after
winning two of three road games
last week. At Gettysburg last
Monday, a two-run double by
designated hitter Val Bianco
highlighted a three-run fourth
inning that gave the Cats a 4-3 win.

On Wednesday, right fielder

‘Scott Sufrin led a season-high
11-hit barrage with a triple and a‘

double as Pitt outslugged Bucknell,
7-S. Also, Val Bianco led off the
second with his first homer of the
season.

“Our_hitting has spurted in the
last three games,” Lewis said.
“We were hitting too many ‘atom

balls’ early in the season. We hit

hard, but always right at ’em. One

game, we must’ve hit eight right at
their center fielder.” ~
Sandwiched between those two
victories was an 8-5 loss at Temple
last Tuesday in which two Pitt
errors gave the Owls three
unearned‘ runs and a 4-0 lead after
two innings. “Errors have really
hurt us,” lamented Lewis, who had
counted on defense as team
strength before the season\began.

    Penn State D

BY RON SIEGEL

The fourth annual Pitt Invita-
tional Track Meet held last
weekend at Pitt Stadium turned
into a Nittany Lion romp, as Penn
State totally dominated all compet-
itors.

No team scores were kept, but on
a 3-2-1 (ﬁrst-second-third) basis,
Penn State scored 39 points, while

second .place was shared by Pitt,

and Western Michigan with 9%
points each.

While the meet itself was a big
success for’ its founder,’ Pitt Coach
Jim Banner, the Panther perform-
ance was disappointing, although
understandable. With most of
Banner’s runners out of action due
to injury, Pitt did not place once in
anyrunning event. Three Panthers
placed in Field events, with Billy
Rea leading. the way, copping two
titles. ’

Rea easily -won the triple jump
with -a leap of 49-9‘/2, despﬁe
having barely practiced the event
all season. His nearest challenger
was Craig White of Western
Michigan, at 48-0. The Panther
senior had an equally,easy time of
it in his pet event, the long jump,

‘ winning with a 25-11% leap. That

\

jump was also a winner by over a
foot. _

Apparently just to show that he
could do it, Rea won his qualifying
heat for the 100-yard dash with a
10.0 time, but did not compete in
the ﬁnals.

Pitt picked up the rest of its
points in the high jump, with Tim

George Jupin tied Purdue’s Rich-

Panther scoring.
The outstanding performer

award went to Penn State’s Mike
Shine, who set or tied two records

‘individually and contributed to a

third.
Shine tied the mark in the
120-yard high hurdles set by

Nittany Lion Fred Singleton at last
invitational with a 13.9
mark. He took nearly two seconds
off ‘the 440-intermediate hurdles
mark with a 52.4 running, eclipsing
Les Clerkley of Western Michi-
gan’s tie of 52.4, also set last year.

Shine was also a member of the‘

winning PSU mile relay team,
whose 3:1l._0 beat the record Pitt
had set in 1972 and tied last/year,
3:13.3.

Twelve records fell in the two
day meet, and two more were tied.
It would have been 13 if Purdue’s
Larry Burton hadn't pulled a
muscle in the middle of the
220-yard dash.

Netters Boast Record
With Winning Week

BY RON SIEGEL

Winners in two of its last three
matches, the Pitt tennis team
boosted its record and assured
itself of a winning season with just
two matches left to play_.

The netters pulled out a
squeeker over California at_the
Trees, Courts last Wednesday,
copping two doubles matches to
win. George Dieffenbach, Tom
‘Current, and Mike Hobble all won
their singles matches, then all
three helped their doubles teams
win to wrap up the victory. Current
and Dieffenback, playing doubles

together for their third season, won

their match, as did the Mike
Hobble-Bill Wood team. A

Pitt romped to a 9-0 victory over
Allegheny Friday, but coach Fran
Webster insisted the match was
much closer than the score
indicated. “There were some very
tight matches that could have gove
«either way," he explained.

The tables were turned Saturday
as the netters invaded Bucknell,

losing 9-0. . Once again, said
Webster, the score was mis-
leading.

George Dieffenbach carried his
singles match to three sets, and Joe
Kantor was also in a close match,
but the Panther that cam closest to
victory was Alan Levin.

The curly-haired sophomore won
the firstset on a tie-breaker, .7-6,
then almost won the second set.
Levin had several match points, but
an injury to his arm suffered in the
second set hampered his efforts.
He lost the ﬁnal set, 6-3.

The injury to ’ Levin forced

Webster to find a new partner for
his number one doubles player, Joe
Kantor. To the rescue came Mike
Hobble, a freshman.’ Hobble and
Kantor were winning the third set
5-3 against a Bucknell unit that had
only lost once in ten starts, but
were defeated, 7-5. ‘

“I can’t say enough about_the
way Hobble’s, been playing,”
enthused Webster. “He’ll be one
of our top players for the next three
years."

I-lobble’s brother, Harry also
played doubles against Bucknell,
with Bill Wood, and they also did
well.

The season ends tomorrow at 1:11
when Pitt hosts Westminster. _

Lewis points out that his team’s
greatest flaw is its inconsistency,
but consistency is nearly impos-
sible when six‘ of a paltry 19
scheduled games are cancelled by
weather.

“When we went to Temple,”
Lewis said, “they had public

center fielder Paul Seneca and
third baseman Danny Slain, whose
double highlighted the six-run

in the season's opener.

When asked if the Bruins were
motivated, Guidolin retorted:
“Twenty thousand dollars is
enough motivation. It's enough for
me." _

The NHL honored the two teams
at a luncheon Monday and Guidolin
remarked during a short talk: “I
see the Flyers are here. It's nice to
see my team is at the track Garden
State." ,

Guidolin told his team after
Sunday’s nationally-televised 4-1
defeat that they were badly
outhustled.

“Only about six of my guys were
working,” said the chagrined
Boston coach.

The Boston players didn’t argue
their coach's point. '

“The Flyers are hungrier than
we are,” commented a downcast
Bobby Orr.

Guidolin got upset when it was
suggested that maybe a good ﬁght
on the ice would start the Bruins’
adrenalin.

“I’m a Canadian. We have only

closed he would use Don Saleski or

Quarterbacking Key For W.V.U.

BY G.W. STEVENS
Associate Sports Editor
West Virginia University recent-
ly completed Spring football drills
and the outlook is somewhat

brighter for the 1974 season. A
total of 17 starters and 33 lettermen
return from last year’s 6-5 squad as
the Mountaineers shoot for their

DANNY BUGGS

ﬁfth straight winning year under
coach Bobby Bowden. However,
the success of WVU this fall will
depend to a large extent on
consistency at quarterback.

“We’ve got potential and exper-
ience,” Bowden explained, “but
like a bomb, we can’t explode
without an igniter. If our
quarterbacking comes through this
fall, we could be a pretty good
country football team.”

The leading candidate for the
quarterbacking job is junior Ben
Williams who started the last ﬁve
games in 1973. Williams was given
the starting role against Penn State
after injuries to starting quarter-
back Abe Dillon and backup Chuck
Fiorante. He had his best game
against highly-favored Miami di-
recting a brilliant come-from-be
hind victory.

“Ben again established himself
as the number one quarterback
during spring training,” Bowden
says. “He has unlimited potential
but is not as polished as he must
become.” A

The back-up spot is still up for
grabs, and the coaching staff is
concerned about ﬁnding a second
quarterback who can win for them.
Fiorante, who is just now recover-
ing from a shoulder separation, is a
good bet to see quite a bit of action.

'Two talented sophomores, Kirk
Lewis and Tom Loadman, will also
h_ave an opportunity to lead the
Mountaineers.

The remainder of the West
Virginia offense will be exciting
with some [highly-skilled wide
receiversand several good running
backs. All-American Danny
Buggs, who averaged 23 yards per
catch as a wide receiver, will be
back to harass the opposition.
Buggs scored a touchdown every

.sixth timehe handled the ball on

pass receptions, ﬂanker reverses,
punt returns and kickoff returns.

Marshall Mills, who caught 29
passes for 400' yards last season,
will fill the other wide receiver__
spot. Lettermen Bernie Kirchner
and John Everly will also return to
strengthen the
Mounatineer passing attack.

The WVU running attack will
also be in good hands this fall.
Tailback Dwayne Woods gained
800 yards as a sophomore last year
while sharing playing time with
Artie Owens. Owens was also a
sophomore in 1973 and will

 

undoubtedly surpass his 400 yard
total of a year ago. '

The defense will also be
experienced, with eight starters
returning. The front line will be led
by middle guard Jeff Merrow, an
all-East candidate. with tackle John
“Tree" Adams and end Andy
Peters lending support.)

Linebackers Bruce Huffman and
John Spraggins will anchor the
Mountaineer defense. Huffman
was second in tackles last season
with 152 while Spraggins totaled
130. They will be backed-up by an
experienced secondary which in-
cludes returning starters Charlie
Miller, Marcus Mauney, and Jack
Eastwood.

The kicking game has been a big
question mark for Bowden so far
this spring. With the graduation of
placekicker Frank Nestor, who
holds most of the school’s ﬁeld goal
and extra point records, either Emil
Ros or Rockey Gianola will ﬁnd _a
choice spot on the team.

The punting game should im-
prove over last season with the
return of freshman walk-on Chuck
Brooks. Brooks averaged 46 yards
per punt in the ﬁnal spring game
but will be challenged for his
position by tight end Kirchner.

The schedule will be just as

tough as last year, with quite a few .

games ﬁtting into the revenge
category. However, the team will
be more experienced overall and
deeper -at certain positions. If
someone ignited the offense and
the defense can get tougher, West
Virginia could have a very big year.

president Red Auerbach's office,

‘Basketball Association champs are
back as heroes.

The Celtics, who beat the
Milwaukee Bucks 102-87 Sunday
night for their 12th NBA title in 18
years, returned from Milwaukee to
an official city welcome Monday.
“We caught them by surprise,"
said Coach Tommy Heinsohn of the

JPHILADELPHIA AP--Are the
Philadelphia Phillies for real?
Iflyou looked at the standings in
he National League East Monday,
There they were--in first place by a
half-game.

' It's the first time the Phillies
have been in first place, other than
April, since Sept. 26, 1964.

» Manager Danny Ozark just
smiles when he’s asked whether
the flowers blooming in May can
ast through the dog days of July,
August and September.

 “We're a lot like that other team
in town," Ozark said Sunday after
his team swept a three-game series
from Pittsburgh for the ﬁrst time
I 'nce 1969. He referred, of course,
to the Philadelphia Flyers, who are
battling the Boston Bruins for the
National Hockey League Stanley

“All we wanted to do was to keep
him from getting too many shots in
this game," Heinsohn said.

It worked. J abbar was kept to 21
shots and managed to score only 26
points.

Jabbar looked at the situation a
little differently. ‘He said it was not
exactly surprise which did in
Milwaukee in the seventh game of
the series.

“Victory or defeat is in the hands

of the Creator." he said. “I just

Phillies Tops In East

Dick Ruthven. 2-1, has learned to
curb his temper. Steve Carlton, 3-3
has shown flashes of his 27-game
winning form of two years ago. Jim
lonborg, 3-2, isvpitching his best

since winning the Cy Young award .

at Boston in 1967. Maybe most
important, second baseman Dave
Cash .287 has given this team a
leadership absent for many years.

No one in town is predicting a
National League pennant for the
Phillies, "but if the early season
form holds Ozark’s team will be a
factor in an extremely competitive
division. ~ '

In the Phillies‘ recent western
swing the club lost only seven of
eight and dropped only a half-game
in the standings. ~

Ozark still has an ace up his
sleeve in pitcher Wayne Twitchell,
who hasn't played a game.
Twitchell underwent surgery in the
off-season for a knee injury. He's
throwing again, but it will be at
least June before he sees any
action. Twitchell was the club's

bestpitcher last year with a 13-9 .

record and a 2.50 earned run

He coined the phrase, “Yes We

Besides surprise, smooth team-
work also sent the Celts on their
way to winning the Walter A.
Brown Trophy.

Boston center Paul Silas said the
Celtics came out on top because

,“we operate on a team concept.

“No one player" dominated our
team. When one player is having
an off day, someone else just steps
in to help‘out," he said. _‘,‘Just like
Sunday, when John Havlicek was

MISCELLANEOUS

--LOST.-2, rin s-' sentimental value;

involving the Houston Golf Asso-
ciation, the local news media and
some touring players.

The tournament has had its
problems since it moved to the
Quail Valley Country Club from the

prestigious Champions Golf Club, ‘

four years ago.

Last season the tournament

boosted its purse to $205,000,

making it one of the richest on the
tour in the hope of luring some of
the game’s leading players. It
didn't work. So this season the

sponsors cut the purse to $105,000. _

The leading players again skipped.

“The players don’t seem to care
anything about the sponsors,” said
HGA executive director John

‘Davis; “so maybe we shouldn’t

care anything about them.”

Some players contend the HGA
doesn’t.

“I don’t like the HGA,” the
stormy Hill said Saturday, recount-
ing a story of how he was refused
permission to withdraw from the
1973 Houston Open, flew into
town, played the required one
round and then‘--as he’s entitled to
do--withdrew.

“The only reason I'm playing
here is to win and get even,” he
said. “I’m hot at the HGA. I'll
continue to be hot. Even ifI win.”

His remarks appeared in the
local newspapers, and Davis said
Hill had “several lies in the
statement."

The next day, after his victory,
Hill took off at the press. .

“‘I don’t like "to talk ‘to the
press,” he said. “Every time I do
it comes out wrong. Every time I
do, they out me. OI’ Davey don’t

have much blood left. They don’t

hear what I say. They hear when
they want to hear.”

He said he had no quarrel with
the HGA, .“just one man,” and that
he would return to defend his title
next year.

Hill’s comments, the charges
and counter-charges all are just the
tip-of the iceburg, however.

Other players have complained
of hotel rent-car reservations that
went astray or of promised courtesy
cars that failed to arrive.
