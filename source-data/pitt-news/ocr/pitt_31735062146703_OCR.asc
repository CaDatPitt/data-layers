Engineering
Dean Repo rts
Record Year

Applications Refused

Because of Limited

F acilitzes in Division

E. A. Holbrook, dean of the
Schools of Engineering and Mines,
announces that the full time day
registration in
the schools has
passed the 800
mark.

This is the
largest enroll-
ment in the his-
tory of the
schools, exceed-
ing last year's
number by ap-
proximately 60
students.

It was neces-
sary to limit  '
the enrollment
in the freshman DT Holbmok
class to 250 students. Many quali-
ﬁed high school graduates who ap-
plied for entrance after September
1 were refused admission for this
reason. Many of the applicants to
the departments of mechanical and
aeronautical engineering were re-
fused admission. Applications in
those departments alone totaled
over 100.

Limitation of enrollment in the
schools at the present time was
due to the fact that the mechanical
drawing and designing laboratories
are ﬁlled to capacity. Arrange-
ments are being made for increas-
ing the capacity of these drawing
rooms and a new class of students
will be admitted for the second se-
mester in February.

  

Soph Hop Petitions
Available Today

Petitions for the chairmanships
of the Sophomore Hop and Fresh-
man Dance are now available in
the office of the dean of men and
dean of women, announces Theo-
dore W. Biddle, assistant dean of
men.

Petitions for the Sophomore
Hop, which will be held November
4, must be returned to these of-
ﬁces before 5 o’clock next Tuesday.

The SFA Appointments Com-
mittee will interview candidates
for chairmanship October 5, 6, and
7, and the executive committee
will make the ﬁnal selection Oc-
tober 11.

The Freshman Dance petitions
should be returned to the dean of
men's or the dean of Women’s of-
ﬁces by 5 o’clock next Friday, Oc-
tober 7. The dance is scheduled for
December 2.

Druid Members Meet
Today to Plan Initiation

Druids, honorary activities fra-

ternity, will meet today at 3:30
o’clock in the ofﬁce of the dean of
men, 209 Cathedral, to discuss
plans for the initiation of four
newly-elected members, according
to Joe Roberts, president.

The new members, Cortland Ba-
call, BA41; Dick Jones, C41; Bill
Sherries, BA41; and Harold Wint-
ner, C41, were tapped to member-
ship at the Druid Smoker for
freshmen last Wednesday evening.

Roberts asked all members .0
please be at the dean of men’s of-
fice promptly to make the neces-
sary preparations.

 

Students- Must Show
Cards During Series

If the Pittsburgh Pirates, aided
by the weather, and the Chicago
Cubs, succeed in winning first
place in the National league, the
University might use this new
advertising slogan: “Register at
the University of Pittsburgh and
see the World Series.”

It is said by those who seem
to know, that the Cathedral from
various floors is a better van-
tage point for seeing the Forbes
Field games than the tradit'onal
hole in the fence. But anyone not
a student at the University who
cherishes any idea of so using
the Cathedral will have a hard
time in taking advantage of
these observation facilities, for,
accord'ng to John Weber, secre-
tary of the University, anyone
wanting admittance to the Cathe-
dral on the “series” days will be
required to show his registra-
tion card.

According to Inspector Dye of
the city traﬁic division, there will
be no restrictions against stu-
d-ents parking in the vicinity of
the Cathedral, although he sug-
gests that students do not park
in the Schenley park plaza. This
suggestion, says Inspector Dye
is for the protection of the stu-
dents, since anyone parking in
the Plaza in the morning will be
blocked in by the afternoon ball
fans.

Faculty, Association

Will Hold Reception

Joining with the members of the
Faculty Club, the Women’s Associ-
ation of the University will open
the fall program with a reception
tomorrow evening at 8:30 o’clock
in the Faculty Club.

Dancing, bridge, and a program
by Wilson, the English magician,
will provide entertainment.

Reservations are being accepted
by Mrs. Ford E. Curtis, Mrs. Rob-
ert J. Munce, and Mrs. Chester A.
Buckner.

Other events on the October
schedule for the Association in-
clude: a party for newcomers,
Wednesday, October 5; executive
board meeting, October 12 in the
Faculty Club; a lecture meeting,
October 12, with Dr. Herbert L.
Spencer speaking.

On Wednesday, October 19, a
dessert-bridge will be held. A chil-
dren’s Hallowe’en party is sched-
uled in the Foster Memorial on
October 22. “Observatory Night”
will be observed on the evening of

dan, director of the University's
Allegheny Observatory, will speak.

New Edition
Of Fraternity
Guide Issued

Editors of Handbook
Borrow Cover Idea
Of National Magazine

A revived and revised Fraternity
Handbook appeared on campus this
week when the annual publication
was distributed to freshmen men
at their orientation classes.

With a full-page photograph
showing one wing of the Cathedral
and the wrought iron lamp on the
campus, the booklet, titled “Pitt
Fraternity Life,” suggests a well
known pictorial weekly.

“Pitt Fraternity Life” is a com-
plete change from the more formal
handbook of former years. This
year’s book is edited by Robert
Simrell, BA39, Theta Chi, under
Interfraternity Council sponsorship.
He was assisted by William Alli-
son, editor of the Alumni Review.

The new 24-page pamphlet fol-
lows the informal style throughout
with an increased number of pho-
tographs and informal write-ups
of each fraternity. Each fraternity
has a page devoted to it with a
group photograph, Greek letters,
pledge pin and active insignia.
Also included is a short history of
the local group, the national, and
its leading graduate, undergradu-
ate and faculty members.

Between the fraternity pages is
information of interest to new stu-
dents about fraternities and Inter-
fraternity Council. A few words of
explanation and advice are offered
by Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear, dean
of men, and Robert R. Corley, as-
sistant dean.

A page is devoted to the repre-
sentatives to the Interfraternity
Council, publishers of the book.
“Pitt Fraternity Life” is published
by Interfraternity Council, made
up of representatives from the 13
national social fraternities in
Council.

Dr. Papanek Talks
On European Crisis

Presenting an account of the
background and present position
of Czechoslovakia in Central Eu-
rope, Dr. Jan Papanek, Czechoslo-
vak consul for the Pittsburgh dis-
trict will open the regular series of
Inquiry Forum sessions, Monday
at 12:30 o’clock in 132 Cathedral.

Discussing “The European Cri-
sis”, Dr. Papanek will give his
viewpoint of the motives and per-
sonalities of Czech officials based
on his personal associations with
many of them.

Pittsburgh's foremost authority
on the Czech crisis by virtue of his
past diplomatic career, Dr. Papa-
nek is also a personal friend of
Eduard Benes, having served for
three years as secretary to the for-
mer foreign minister of the war-
born republic.

The local consul has spent a life-
time in legation work for his coun-
try. Born in Slovakia, now the
eastern part of Czechoslovakia, he
attended government s c h o o 1 s
throughout his country. From the
“gymnasium” at Moravia he was
drafted into the army at the out-
break of the World War.

With the Czech legion he went
to Italy where he launched his dip-
lomatic career by working in the
local legation.

For his outstanding work and
intellectual attainment, Dr. Papa-

Pitt Gridders Meet

Owls Tomorrow

Temple Boasts Fine ‘°

Defensive Outﬁt

Dr. Sutherland’s pack of roving
Panthers may turn up the joker
in the Pitt football schedule when
they meet Pop Warner’s Temple
Owls tomorrow afternoon in Phila-
delphia.

Wily Pop Warner, who has
turned out many great football ma-
chines in his years as coach, many
of them spent at Pitt, would con-
sider a victory over a team coached
by Sutherland, his outstanding pu-
pil, one of the high points in his
coaching career.

The Temple eleven will be lurk-
ing behind a cloud of suspicion
that the Owls are weak. Their slim
margin of victory, 6-0, over Al-
bright last Friday night has helped
spread the rumor, and the stage is
set for a startling upset.

Pitt’s‘ backﬁeld will be really
tested by the Temple line, which
will outweigh the Panther forward
wall by 10 pounds. The Owl sec-
ond team line is almost on a par
with the ﬁrst stringers.

If the Temple line -should be too
tough for the Panthers to solve
Saturday, Dr. Jock Sutherland will
likely break up his famous back-
ﬁeld, and shoot Ben Kish to full-
back, moving Goldberg over to
Cassiano’s halfback slot.

Curly Stebbins, who got off to a
grand start against West Vilginia,
will be back at the right halfback
position. Larry Peace, who played
brilliantly against the Mountain-
eers, will answer the whistle if
Stebbins is unable to start.

Dick Cassiano will start the
game at left half. Smashing John-
ny Chickerneo will “mow them
down” from the quarterback block-
ing post. Ben Kish will ﬁll in at
either full or half and Bob Thur-
ban will understudy Cassiano.

While the Pitt backﬁeld is the
focus of most attention, the Pan-
ther forward wall continues the
tradition of great lines. A] Lezous-
ki, Steve Petro, and understudy
Harold (call me Butch) Klein keep
the Panther well stocked in great
guards.

Bill Daddio started the season in
All-American stride against West
Virginia and his smashing play
should stymie any attempt of the
Temple attack to circle his end.
Fabian Hoffman, at the other end,
will make Owls search other parts
of the line for a soft spot.

Walt Raskowski, Elmer Merkov—
sky, Ed Gurczenski, and Ted Ko-
netsky give the Panthers a quar-
tet of tacklers who are really
tough.

Bob Dannies will again be in the
snapper-back role. Bob had a little
difficulty with his down-the-ﬁeld
blocking against West Virginia but
with another game or two under
his belt Dannies will handle his
position capably.

For the first time in years the
end of the ﬁrst quarter may not
find Coach Sutherland injecting an
entire second team into the game.
Four or ﬁve fresh men may enter
the scene but unless Pitt has a lead
the bulk of the ﬁrst team will carry
the burden.

Tomorrow attention will be paid
to the punting and down-the-field
blocking.

Larry Peace, second string back,
walked off with punting honors.
Chickerneo was a little uncertain
and Goldberg got little distance on
his punts.

 

Dr. Macartney Gives
Talk on ‘Opportunity’

Dr. Clarence Edward Macartney
will preach his annual sermon on
opportunity —— “Come Before Win-
ter,” for the twenty-third time
Sunday night at the First Presby-
terian Church, downtown.

At the morning service, Dr.
Macartney will preach on “Be 21
Christ.” The double quartet, under
the direction of Aneurin Body-
combe, will sing. Students are espe-
cially invited to attend both serv-
ices.

X-Country
Team Races
Purdue

Hill and dale trained Pitt cross
country runners will run over the
Indiana prairies tomorrow morn-
ing in their season’s beginning
when they race Purdue at Lafay-
ette.

Pitt won last year. This season
Carl Olson has a young, inexperi-
enced team.

Leaving this morning by motor
were Frank McCabe, Al Boulanger,
Ben and Casmir Kopec, Walt Ster-
ner, Bob Coggswell, and Captain
Al Zamborski —— the seven-man
team.

Potts Asks Immediate Retam
0f Intramural Entry Blanks

“Get those entry blanks in at‘
once,” said Jimmy Potts, director
of intramural athletics, yesterday
morning as he sat in his 27th ﬂoor
office, arranging the plans for
Pitt’s greatest intramural adven-
ture.

Potts was referring speciﬁcally
to the entry blanks that are re-
quired for admissionand partici-
pation in the fall program which
includes touch football, tennis,
soccer, horseshoes, and cross-coun-
try.

Deadline for entries into the
football, tennis, soccer, and horse-
shoe phase of the program has
been set for Wednesday, October
5. Cross-country entries may be
delayed for a few more weeks.

With intramural athletics the re-
cently—adopted keynote of the Uni-
versity’s athletic department, elab-
orate preparations have been made
for developing this type of student
sport activity along the broadest
possible basis which means par-
ticipation in -some of its phases by
each man student on the campus.

Every type of campus organiza-
tion has been urged to enter a
representative team. The great ma-
jority have indicated an immediate
affirmative response.

sents his viewpoint. Members of
the audience question him for the
remainder of the period.
