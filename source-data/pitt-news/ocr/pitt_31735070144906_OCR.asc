Backyard Brawl is about

more than just football  

by Greg Trietley
- Staﬁ’iWri'ter .
Beyond heated West Virginia-
Pitt basketball and football battles,
friendly competition between the
two schools exists across all sports.
They brawl in a big backyard.
In the women’s tennis version
of the Backyard Brawl, the Pan-

thers are undefeated against the

Mountaineers over the last two
seasons.

V “The last four scores have been
4—3, so that makes for a great ri-
valry between the two schools,”
said,Pitt women’s tennis coach
George Dieffenbach. “The girls
know their personnel. They know
our personnel  It’s a match that

we look forward to.”

Before two victories last season,
Pittsburgh had never defeated West
Virginia, going 0-27.

“Up until last year, we had never
beaten them before,” said Pitt tennis
senior Christie D’Achille. “They’ve

always been our biggest rival on our _ ;

schedule and our number one team
that yve set out to beat.”
. West Virginia women’s tennis

c0ach_ Marc'Walters agrees about

the rivalry.

“I think there’s been a mo-—

mentum swing in the rivalry over i

the past three years,” said=Walters.
“Pitt’s really kind of handed it to-us
in everything. It stings doubly when
it’s Pitt that’s ‘beating-you.” I

T Canceled debate

i just simple polities

‘For those waiting on pins and

 needles for the debates between
E MayorLukeRavenstahl andhis chal-

.  lengers in the Democratic primary,

 City Councilman Patrick Dowd and
; attorney Carmen Robinson, the past

 several weeks have brought nothing

 but bad news. First, as a result of the
; shootingideath_s of three Pittsburgh
 police officers last weekend, local
 broadcast stations WPXI—TV and
 KDKA—TV both rescheduled the
 primary debates for a later time

And now Ravenstahl has said

 that his camp has no open dates to

 which they can move the KDKA

 debate, effectively canceling it Dowd
 objected to the move, of course —
 if the debate were to go forward it
 would only.be him and Robinson.

§ Neither of them is an incumbent, so _

 it’s hard to think that much inﬂuential
 debate would occur.

According to .the Ravenstahl

 camp, the only open date they have
 before the May 19 Democratic pri-
E mary is May 4, which is also the date
 that WPXI took with their resched-
 uled debate But we understand how

 diﬂicult scheduling can be some— ‘

 times, when there’s so many
 sports games ancl concerts to go to
 in the next few weeks —: although,
 unfortunately, Kenny Chesneywon’t
 be back in town untiljune 6.

Even so, to the casual observer,

 it certainly looks as though Raven;
 stahl is  out of a debate
E Debates are one of the only ways that
 the voting public can get to know
 the candidates’ stances on a variety

of issues, as well as to see how they

, respond under pressure The fact that
 Ravenstahl is so  to just throw
I one away without  more of an

7 effort to reschedule certainly doesn’t

 

help his 

But for his part, Dowd doesn’t }
5 seem gracious or understanding. f
He accused Ravenstahl of using the ;
shooting deaths as an excuse to get .
out of the debates, a comment that 3
Ravenstahl’s own camp called ‘‘dis— ,3
 offensive and completelyout 

of line” in a letter to KDKA.

Although Dowd did bring up ii
some valid points about the state of '
. the mayor’s office, such as ethical

concerns over campaign contribu-

tions’ and personal use of city proper- A
. ty, his comments strike a particularly 
sour note that  portray him as 3

too quick to play the blame—game

But really, we shouldn’t expect?
anything different This is the state i
of political discourse in modern 
America: accusatory sniping from .
behind the cover of press releases :
and prepared statements while :
avoiding actual discourse as much ;

as possible

Therealshameofthisstoryis that i '
the other two debates that remainwill 
necessarily be more rushed and have M
to encompass a larger amount of ‘ 
material, lowering the effectiveness 1

of the whole process. Either that, or

 that was planned for the 
third debate will have to be dropped f
entirely,which would be just as much 

of a loss.

Either way, the only person win'-  i
ning out on this is Ravenstahl,iwho 
gets to go into the p1imary'with an E
incumbent status, a huge politicalwar ; 
chest and, now, one debate less than '
anyone was anticipating. We can’t say 3
whether Ravenstahl’s choice to cancel 
rather than reschedule was entirely 
political or simply fell to scheduling ‘
conflicts, but we can say that regard— 
less,'it didn’t hurt his chances. I ~

Tuesdays with Molly-

by Molly Green
Columnidt '

     

For those of you who don’t keep
up with important political news,
President Obama ﬁnally picked the.
“first puppy” —— a Portuguese water
dog named Bo. ,

Needless to say, I’m a little alarmed
at the speed of this “appointment”
One minute Obama is browsing
local shelters for labradoodles 4 a
crossbreed of the Labrador retriever
and the miniature poodle,‘cle_arly it
does not get more American than
that — and the next he’s invited some
foreigner, some Portuguese duck dog,
into the White House.

Where is the oversight? The
checks and balances? The Senate
committee meeting?

A -For those who think this an over-
reaction, it’s time I let you in on a little
secret All people, but especially those
in power, are judged based on their
pets. That dog represents Obama.
Obama represents the United States.
We live in the United States, and
therefore that dogs image is reflec-
tive of us. _ ' ' '

Have any of you forgotten former
French presidentjacques Chirac and
his clinically depressed Maltese? Back

_  Chirac was mauled by the

dog, which is prone to  “vi-
cious, unprovoked attacks,” according
to Chirac’s wife, Bernadette.

Clearly this has negatively. affected
the world’s opinion of France. For
example, the majority of Americans
currently have a negative opinion of
the French government, according to

“the Pew Global Attitudes project.
Or take former President George ~-

W Bush’s terrier, Barney. Back in
November, the little monster bit a
reporter right on the White House
lawn! Bush ended his term with only
a 22 percent approval rating, accord-
ing to CBS News. No doubt, this was

largely because of Barney’s unforgiva‘

able antics. Statistics don’t lie.

So you see, it’s just as important
to vet the Obama’s supposed ﬁrst
dog as it_is to vet a potential treasury
secretary. And because the Senate
wouldn’t man up, I decided to do

it myself. . , ~ .

Rumors of a first dog began
circulating last November when
Obama promised Sasha and Malia
a puppy as a reward‘ for dealing with
the campaign craziness — but for a

5 while, some of us worried that this
might have just been more political

_ rhetoric, as we all know Obatna hands
' out campaign promises like Happy

Meals. V ,

made no progress.'Luckily, ABC .

News ‘Chief Washington corre-
spondent George Stephanopoulos
called Obama out, to which Obama
gave this measly response: The pro-
cess of finding a first dog “has been

tougher than finding a commerce

secretary.”
Whatever.

As with all of his government ap-

pointees, Obama was very specific

with what _he wanted ﬁom the first
dog: first, that the dog be a hypoal-
lergenic breed —— Obama did not
receive any campaign contributions
from the ﬁne people at Claritin, and
he’ll be damned if he supports the
bastards now — and second, ever
wary of his elitist image, that they

’ get the dog from a shelter.

Well, Obama made good on one

of his promises, at least Thedog is in- _ j
- deed hypoallergenic —— Claritin won’t

see" a penny from the Obamasl — but
B0 is not a shelter dog. Oh no. Bo, my
friends, is a Kennedy — specifically a
gift from Sen. Ted Kennedy, accord-
ing to the Chicago Sun-Tirnes.

This brings‘ me to my second
worry. Clearly what we have here is_
an example of «a Washington insider

So, as an act of public.service, I

I havecomposed this comprehensive

guide that I hope will save more than
a couple geek lives this year. If you
count yourself as one, keep this col-
umn in your pocket’ Should you ﬁnd
yourself trapped in a party situation,
follow these steps to ensure that you
make it out alive. '

1. Pick your corner early.

If you’re going to spend the en-
tire night  from the rest of the
party in a corner, then you’d better
find one as quickly as possible. At the
standard fraternity party, you have
anywhere between 30 minutes to an
hour to pick one before they’re all

. claimed. You might even be able to

choose your corner based on factors
such as minimum distance to the
front door and maximum distance
from other partiers. _ . ..

If you’re at a party with a high
percentage of social rejects, though,
like a Mensa social, then you might
have as few as 10 minutes to claim
your spot before theyfre all spoken
for. In this situation, you can’t be
choosy. You need to plant yourself in
the first comer you can find, or you
face the danger of  to actually
participate in the party.

 

If you find yourself in the unfor-

 tunate circumstance of losing your

corner‘ at the Dr; Who Fan-Fiction

' scheduled start time, don’t panic.

lery in the Frick Fine Arts Building '

plays home to a juried exhibition

of the Studio Arts Departrnent’s
student works. -

' Department chair Delanie
Jenkins ‘explained that seniors
are required to submit up to six
pieces of work to a faculty jury.
There are criteria for how works
are presented, giving them a taste
'at what it’s, like to submit work
professionally. '

“This show is a little bit deer-
in'—the—headlights for students,”
said Jenkins. “It’s the culminating
moment, they’re almost over the
threshold but not yet, so it’s a mo-
ment of awe.” '

\While the exhibition isianpexcit—

.ing opportunity for the-artists, it
also requires stressful -preparation

—— something students learn to
handle during their undergradu-
ate training.

“There are rigorous critiques.
People who are expecting the
studio arts major to be like high

T school art classes usually get scared

pretty quick. It’s all about learning
the skills,” said Jenkins.’ _ . 5 '

The show includes work by a

few underclassmen but primar—-
ily focuses on seniors: Submitted '

pieces, were narrowed frorn5»22O

to 127. . I
“It’s the biggest show we’ve

ever had and it’s chock—full of really i

great artwor ,” said Jenkins. ‘.‘We
have an awesome group this year.
Every year the show gets better.
This is the mark, the end of their
time and they get to see what has
been acknowledged by faculty as
successful. We’re really proud and
excited for them.” I ’ \ . i
One such artist is Tanya Swartz,
a senior double-majoring with
English writing and a winner of

J theiBet-qty Blockstein Levinei'Memo—

 Award. She found her.passion

for art at a young age, spending
summers with her grandmother
and taking art classes.

One of her most interesting
pieces in the gallery is a paper—ﬁlled

inspection, the paper is actually

Astronauts of Antiquity/s latest isn’t just for dummies

Astronauts Of Antiquity have very
good reason to feel uplifted.
The indie band combines the

    
  
 

sohd
tracks on

 
  

, musical genres electronica and neo-

soul, and its world—uniting musical
sound reminisces with some jazzy
and disco beats. .

Best of all, for people looking
for something beyond the everyday
mainstream, the band’s odd m_usic
calls for some not-too-standard
lyrics.

Not being able to predict the

next line before it’s harmonized
with a familiar chord is a nice
switch from, well, plain—old pre-
dictable. _

Spacey and beat—heavy, the be-
ginning of the album hosts a proud
sliding guitar that leads into lyrics,
“I wake up in the morning to the
sound of a distant train. / Wish I
had a ticket to that place where I
feel safe. '/ The phone is ringing
off the hook before I can answer it.
/ So much to do all the time ...”

If listeners are human, there
is a 99.9 percent chance that they
have experienced some kind of
day like this. _

In the same song, vocalist India
proclaims,’ “If I saw you anywhere,

/ I have nothing to feel. / If I saw ‘

you in everything, /I’d be grateful
for all that you bring.”

Hear that? More than one per-
son has one of those days.

Continuing on the band’s musi-
cal journey, the music to the track
“Strangest Places” somehow rings
of a jazzy beat through its outer

space synchronic sensation.
Listeners might feel as if they
are sitting at a warm, cozy dance
club diner, as the vocalist calls
out between soaring brass notes,
“There are no closed cases / When
it comes to help above.” A remind-

er to be open to the powers that ’

be, perhaps?

Leaving jazz territory as the
album continues, “Sup A Soul”
tells everyone where they start off
—— “Stuck in a sardine can. / No
room to move around. / I hear a
melody breeze through the crack. /
Two kids playing violins ...” From
there the song kicks up its heels,
preaching to listeners that they
should free their minds and that

they can ﬁnd a beat to who they V

are + and can be a superman or --

superwoman.

The showcased beauty in the
band’s lyrics is the ability to ﬁnd
soulful things to say without bein
dark and depressed. -

They didn’t take the easy’ way
out of their writing style by making

listeners cry. Track title “Break-
through” continues this happy
trend, passionately proclaiming,
“The universe is going to surprise
you. / I got nothing but faith.”
Then, to soften the dancing de-
mands the album usually demands,

“Beautiful Fate” slows down. The

next time life drives listeners into

a corner, they ought to give this
song a listen, with its chorus, “It’s
a beautiful fate. / Taking yourself
on a blind date. / Substitute your
self-hate. / Everything else can
wait. / It’s a beautiful fate. / Wake
me up from all that’s fake. / Let

Kristijan Hoover, a senior doubl_e~major— if
ing with history of art and architecture, said "

A she originally came to Pitt to study medicine.

After taking a few art classe’s,'howeVer, she
realized her heart belonged in a more cre-i
ative ﬁeld. ' _ .

In addition to some of,her photography
work,  Hoover has three installations in
the gallery, all revolving around a theme“
dubbed ‘‘\What eats us up.” _ -

One piece is a provocative dining table
setting, with each plate ﬁlled with mirror
shards, bullets and   _

“In a literal sense, it_’si'iabout the things
you put on your plate effects they
have on you,”. said ]ari"I-Ioover. “The

the violence that is part of our life.”

Another artist is Nancy Egger, a senior .

studio art. Her abstract self-portraits, made
for an upper-level painting course, feature a
large photograph of her back. After cutting

the picture into strips, she collaged them

onto a painted canvas.

“I was really interested in cutting up the
body, not in a harsh way, but to take the focus
off of the whole,” said Egger. “I wanted to"

stretch the picture to fit the canvas, instead

of vice versa, to change the image and your
perception of the body.”

Egger admitted that while. submitting
pieces was very stressful for the students
and faculty, the reward was worth it. i 

' “The show is the culmination of our four
years of hard work there." It’s impressive to

see our class’ bodyof work together andsay,

‘Wow. This is what’we’ve done.”’ i _

a in spring football practice at this

time last year. But Smith wasn’t
on the sideline this Saturday at the
Blue-Gold football scrimmage at
Heinz Field.

That’s because Smith is done

i _ with football. - ‘-

As the 20_O8 se’ason came to
a close, Srrlith found. himself a

- third-string quarterback , on the
Panthers and didn’t see a great

chance at getting time the next
year. He moved on. The 6-foot-3
redshirt sophomore from Cran-
berry Township picked up a base-
ball bat for the first time inthree
years, and, judging by the way he’s
played for Pitt so far this year, he
hasn’t missed a beat. -

-Smith has ‘started 12 of th :

team’s 30 gamep so far in 2009,

batting .283, with nine RBIs and.
I oneihome run. i

His team currently is 17-13
(4-8 Big East), with 21 games ‘left
in the regularseason before, the
Big East tournament.

But Smith wasn’t sure exactly

how it would all work out. He
didn’t ‘know if he could still play
the game at such a high level.
Now, most of his doubts have
been extinguished.

“I really 'didn’t think I was go-

really feel I’m contributing to my .

team right now.”
Such a long time away from

the game had an initial effect on

Smith, but as the season’s_ rolled
on, he’s gotten more "comfort-
able. ‘ "
“Three years of not touching
_a bat was hard,” said Smith. “But
I’Ve' been hitting well the past
couple games.”
Even though Smith hasn’t
forgotten about the pigskin, he
is completely committed to the

Losses to Panthers sickeni W V U players in all sports

Rivalry, page 1

Indeed, Walters, a Morgantown

native, noted his built-in personal-

disposition toward Pittsburgh.

“[Pitt is] No. 1 on my calendar,”
said Walters. “I have a deep affinity
for WVU sports  I have personal
feelings that it’s sickening to me to
lose to Pitt.”

Still, the tennis rivalry is without
hostility. Many players and coaches
know each other. -.

“We see them all year,” said Pitt
tennis senior Kristy Borzai “We
know all the, girls, they know all of

us,. and we know the coach. We’ve A ,

had a long relationship with West
Virginia. We always look forward
to playing them, but I would say

valry,” said Dieffenbach. “We have

. a lot of respect for their coach, and

their team and their school.”

George is one of the coaches that
helped me get acquainted with the
conference,” said Walters. “George
is one of" those coaches that I’ve
enjoyed working with arid can cer-
tainly be honest with. When we
have our matches  everything is
first class on both ends.”_

The women’s gymnastics team
hopes it can follow the same path
as the‘ tennis team. Panthers gym-
nastics last defeated West 
in 2000.

“[\X./est Virginia has] a really re-
spectable program,” said Pitt senior
gymnast Alix Croop. , “It would be
awesome to beat them. We’re al-
ways right up there with them, so

“We have old teammates from _

back before college on their team,

or friends that we competed against"

Ties in the sport are rare, but
both deadlocks in Pitt history have
come against West Virginia. Croop
stated that the ties add to the ri-

valry.

in which the Backyard_Brawl traces
back to 1934-35.

“It’s, a pretty big deal,” said Pitt
senior wrestler Zach Scheaffer. “[A
win ir1 the Pitt—West Virginia match

usually] puts you first or second in‘

the conference.”
Scheaffer and the Panthers last
year snapped a Mountaineer six-

game  streak over the squad,
winning 18-17. To win under the

“hostile crowd” at the West V1rginia"a  

. we more look forward to beating we’re capable of doing it.” Coliseum was one of Scheaffer’s fa-
them.” Like the tennis rivalry, many op— Vorite Pitt experiences, he said.
“I think it’s a very healthy ri— posing gymnasts know each other. “To beat West Virginia, every-

body was really pumped,” said
Scheaffer. “We edged them out and
beat them. It was really intense.”

Walters noted Dieffenbach before,” said Croop. “For us it’s like . Wrestling is 30—22—2 all—time
