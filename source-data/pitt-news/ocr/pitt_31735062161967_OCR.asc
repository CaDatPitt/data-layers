Maintenance Workers’, Strike Continues

BY TOM VERBISH

The University will not close and
food service activities will return to
normal today, according to a panel
of union and administrative repre-
sentatives meeting in the Tower’s
lobby last night to answer student
questions about the strike by
Service Employees International
Union Local 29.

Tom Albert, director of Univer-
sity Food Services, said, “A verbal
agreement has been reached with
Local 29 whereby they will permit
Szabo workers and fodd delivery
trucks to cross their picket lines.”

A general deterioration of
dormitory living conditions has
resulted from the strike by

‘University spokesman Myron

Judge Claims Injunction

Not Necessary Instantly

BY BILL HADUCK

It appeared unlikely yesterday
that an injunction would be handed
down to prevent the two day old
janitor’s strike from continuing for
at least a few more days.

According to Common Pleas
Court Judge Warren Watson, “The
immediacy of the problem” isn’t
such that he would “have to issue
an order instantly.” University
officials had hoped Watson would

Food, Sanitation Problems

Will accumulating filth on

. Because of the strike of custodial’

workers on this campus, things you
might take for granted, like three

meals a day and reasonable
sanitation, have become major
concerns.

Police Chief Reportedly Resigning

by SCOTT MACLEOD

Recently appointed Chief of
Campus Police, uniform division,
Robert Fadzen, was reportedly on
the verge of resigning today,
according to an informed source
inside the police department.

“I'll be gone" Friday. the source
quoted Fazden as saying earlier
this week.

It could not be confirmed by either
Fadzen or Joseph Gil, Director of
Health. Safety. and Security that
Fadzen was resigning. However.
many sources close to the police
department did confirm it had been
strongly rumored that his resigna-
tion was coming soon.

Fadzen was unavailable for
comment last night. Gil. in a
telephone interview said. “I have
no comment. I haven't looked into
other matters because I've been
tied up with the work stopage. l
have no comment."

Hired by the University last
December 3, Fadzen was consider-
ed popular among the members of
the force. He had initiated action
in several major areas for improve-
ment, including:

--getting the squad cars and vans
in top condition.

--getting high quality training for
the. force from the state police
barracks training center.

--plans for various information
seminars,

--trying to work out personality
problems on the force.

During interviews with other
officers, an incident was exposed
that may have motivated Fadzen’s
resignation.

Recently. Officer Arnold Tarr filed
a report. exposing the hazards of
the Campus Police ambulance.
which is not equipped with safety
straps for the stretcher. The report
followed an accident when a

student was injured on an
emergency trip to a local hospital.

“Joe Gil saw the report and said it
wasn’t valid, ” an officer reported.

“Then Tarr was told he should
retract the report.” Another
officer quoted Gil as saying, “Tell
Officer Tarr to change the report or
he will be suspended.”

Fadzen reportedly sided with Tarr
on the issue. which is still under
deliberation. Fadzen told Tarr he
could expect official word on the
situation today. One officer said
this incident. along with a
multitude of others, probably
caused Fadzen's resignation.

Campus Police officer Arnold Tarr
expressed suspicion about Fad-
zen's premature resignation.

“If Bob Fadzen is resigning
because he couldn't get relief from
Joe Gil, that tells me there is a

Operation of the University
cafeterias has been largely taken
over by volunteers, while Univer-
sity Housing claims to be doing the
most possible with a skelton staff.
When asked what was being done
about facilities in the dormitories,
Housing suggested students adjust
to the situation. “We’ll give you a
can of cleanser if you want to clean
it yourself. Your best bet is not to
make a mess.”

Rumors that the University would
be closed down by health ofﬁcials
proved unfounded. One county
health ofﬁcial noted that the
situation had not even come to his

’ attention, but that inspectors would

be sent to examine the operation of
the cafeterias by student volun-
teers.

A source in the Student Health
Service was concerned over the
lack of adequate sanitation in the
Service's patient areas. “There is
a potential danger,” he admitted.
“lt’s very difficult to treat patients
in areas that are not maintained.
It's common sense that once things
get dirty it’s hard to maintain
optimum conditions.”

Failure of elevators, short of
people being trapped inside them,
will also add to the general
confusion, as Westinghouse re-
pairmen are honoring the picket
lines.

Facilities at Trees’Hall are also
falling victim to the strike.

Fifth, Forbes

BY THOMAS P. CLOONAN

Oakland's traffic congestion
stems from inadequate parking
spaces rather than the one-way
traffic on Fifth and Forbes
Avenues, local merchants said
yesterday.

In contrast with previous atti-
tudes, the 25 businessmen and

presidents attending an Oakland

Chamber of Commerce luncheon

.mentioned no dissatisfaction with

the one-way system. Discussion
centered around the City's plans

 for Oakland parking facilities.

Executive City Planning Director
Joseph Wozniak described pro-

lblems in determining sites and

sizes of proposed construction, but
no target dates or definite plans
were set.

Taking a strikingly different

‘stance, a Pittsburgh Model Cities

Commission meeting Wednesday

night demanded an immediate
return to two-way traffic. Two
dozen angry uptown residents
insisted City Council enforce its
mandate for two-way traffic and
overrule Mayor Peter F. Flaherty's
decision to leave Fifth and Forbes
one-way. '

The Downtown-to-Oakland
thoroughfares became one-way in a
60 day experiment begun June 18,
1972. Although the Mayor's office
and the Traffic Planning Depart-
ment hailed the plan as a success,
Uptown residents and Oakland
merchants claimed otherwise and a
City Council order of October 24.
i972 called for a return to the
two-way system.

The City administration pointed
first to construction on Fifth
Avenue and then to the closings of
the Melwood Avenue and Fern
Hollow bridges as reasons for the

continuance of the one-way

pattern.

The Fern Hollow span, a section
of Forbes Avenue linking the City's
Squirrel Hill district with neigh-
boring Wilkinsburg, opened last
June I. The Melwood Avenue
bridge on Baum Boulevard re-
opened December 3].

The Mayor's present position is
represented in his 1974 budget
message: “Further construction
on Forbes Avenue will necessitate
the retention of one-way traffic on
Fifth and Forbes." His office will
make no other statement on the
subject.

City Traffic Engineer G. James
Balzer prefers the system as is and,
while conceding some aspects
might need refinement, would like
to see it become permanent. Citing
the added street-crossing safety for
pedestrians, Balzer said “l think
we have proved to the people that it
works, all but for a small number.
And we’ll never change their
minds.”

One of those whose opposition
remains steadfast is the Reverend
Donald Mcllvane, public safety
chairman of the Pittsburgh Model
Cities Commission and pastor of
the Hill District's St. Richard's
Church. ,

Mcllvane feels the plan succeeds
in Oakland. but fails in the Uptown
section. “These are two areas with

a vast difference." he says.

“One is a struggling residential
area, the other a university and
business area. There is no
question as to its moving better in
Oakland, not in Uptown, where it
becomes near Gist Street a
speedway, and then closer to town
a bottleneck.”

Mcllvane calls for a compromise
allowing the Oakland section to
remain one-way while reconverting
the Uptown section to a two-way
traffic flow.

The directional change has
meant alterations in 16 bus routes,
but the Allegheny County Port
Authority Transit (PAT)'is satisfied
with the set-up. Carrying 19% of
its passenger volume through
Oakland. PAT last April began a
“wrong-wayﬁ’ bus land on Fifth
Avenue to accomodate Uptown
residents complaining of long and

dangerous treks to bus stops.
PAT is pleased with the bus lane
and would like to extend it further
up Fifth, beyond the Cathedral of
Learning to Bellefield Avenue.
“Our first interest is to be a good
neighbor," says Transit Operations
Director Harold H. Geissenheimer.

,. “We'll run on whatever streets are

available."

Just what streets will be
available remains an issue, though
a quieting one. A civil suit calling
for a return to two-way traffic was
filed by Oakland businessmen in
Commonwealth Court last March,
but dismissed for lack of proper
legal grounds.

A Model Cities-sponsored pro-
test last April 23 brought only the
arrest of three men, including
Mcllvane, for obstructing traffic.

Support for the one-way system
has come from the West Penn
Motor. Club on the basis of a poll
conducted among its membership.
Oakland Development Inc. (ODI)
has extended qualified support,
contingent upon better parking

This January 22 the U. S. Celebrates the Supreme Court’s decision in redefining person-
hood, in granting certain ambiguous rights to a woman to destroy the prental occupant in her
womb. The Justices ignore bio-genetic facts that the child is a living, human individual. They
misconstrue abortion’s niche in public morality by the often used transparent catchphrase-
“a woman’s right to control her own body”—hinting pro-life is somehow anti-woman.

Dance marathon, phone booth stuffing

, BY RITA VITOLO

The happy days, an ABC
television advertisement squeals,
were when “the D.A. was a
haircut...and everybody liked Ike.”
American Graffiti wants to know
where you were in ‘62. The Lone
Ranger is riding again, this time on
Saturday afternoon TV. And
Dylan's back. The message is,
kiddies: Pick a past, anybody’s
past, and have some fun with it.
Prolong your adolescence a little
more. .

Nostalgia is alive and well. And
living at Pitt this weekend.

Billed as the ﬁrst Pitt Nostalgia
Weekend, the program jointly
sponsored by the Student Union
Board and the Public Relations
Committee of Student Government
includes a Mickey Mouse Club

Revival, phone booth stufﬁng,
tricycle races and 15 cent ice cream
cones, as well as a 24 hour dance
marathon for the beneﬁt of the
American Red Cross.

The weekend's sponsors,,how-
ever, think nostalgia for days gone
by is neither overworked nor
ﬂagging in popularity. “Since No,
No, Nanette started the whole
thing a few years ago,” contends
Dean Siegal, a senior member of
the Public Relations Committee,
“each generation has taken its turn
to be nostalgia, and now it’s our
turn. Why Nostalgia Week-end?
Because it's the current thing."

originator of the idea: “We’re not

declared the fad had caught on

claiming that one of the natural

Receiving pressure from several
areas, particularly a Pitt News
letter to the editor (January 11) that
described the practice as an
“outrageous cruelty," the Com-
mittee eliminated the contest from
the program. ,

Although sentiment was strong
among Committee members to
continue with the contest, acting on
the advice of the University
attorney, Eller has dropped the
matter entirely. .“The contest is
definitely off. The University has
asked us not to do it because it
would be very bad publicity.”

The Committee is determined to
get the show on the road, despite
difﬁiculties. Originally designated
as a means of publicizing Student
Government’s activities on cam-
pus, Eller contends that they have
more than succeeded.

“Our goal was to get publicity
for Student Government. And even
if this doesn't work out, we
achieved our purpose. The
publicity we’ve gotten through this

hassle, has been terriﬁc.”

believe Student Government can
play a vital role. University
expansion has been undertaken
without consulting the community.
Pitt has been displacing residents
without securing adequate housing
for them.

The vast facilities of this campus
are closed to them and I believe
they should be allowed to use the
Hillman Library. the medical
facilities. and attend the cultural
events and night classes which the
University carries.

Bob Heister

Question: What do youlhold as the
most important point in your
campaign?

Heister: Well, there are two points
I'm running on--continuity and
experience. Experience in that I've
had a year on the Board and I've
proved that I'm a hard working
member.

l'm running on continuity be-
cause the Student Government
from year to year changes its
priorities. Unless we have some
sort of continuity. we are not going
to be able to solve the problems
that take more than a year to work
out.

Q What are the problems?
Heister: They are the three areas
the Board decided to concentrate
on last year--the planning for a new
student union. building the intra-
mural athletics program. and
looking into the registration-
advising problem.

Q What have you accomplished
this last term?

Heister: We have done an awful lot
of research concerning the new
union. Polls were taken to see what
the commuters and the dormers
want to see.

Q How about
problem?

Heister: We have been meeting
with Fred Koloc (director of
advising center) and with Frank
Reed (concerning the registration
problem).

The problem is that the
University moves like a turtle. it
moves very slow. You can't change
it overnight. We have to analyze
the problem and come up‘ with a
viable solution.

Another problem is that there
are a million other things to do as a
Board member. There are many
other responsibilities.

Q And what about the lntramurals
problem?

Heister: This is a test case. We
are working together with the

the advising

 

administration trying to get some-
thing done. The administration
process takes a long time. It's
overwhelming.

Susan
Hayes

Question: What do you describe as
the most important issue in your
campaign?

Hayes: I feel there are a lot of

students who don't know how much _

the Student Government
has. I would like to create an
atmosphere of awareness. Stu-
dents should find out what Student
Government is. lwould like to see
more people involved.

Through this involvement. there
would be greater pressure on
Student Government to do what the
students want.

Q How would you increase the

p()V\/Cl‘

awareness of studehts so they

would take a greater interest in
SGB affairs?

Hayes: The best way is through
publicity. More consideration
should be given (to publicity). You
can put flyers in mailboxes and
those kind of things. This would
start word of mouth communication
which would also be good. And
when you allocate funds. more
priorities should be given than it is
now.

Q How do you feel about the
allocations generally?

Hayes: The biggest gripe I hear is
the way funds are allocated. A lot
of people are dissatisﬁed. And the
housing problem here is bad. The
dorm council should have more
power. The dorms here should
have more of a home atmosphere.
Through the dorm council's allo-
cations. a lot of improvements
could be made.

Q How do you feel about security?
Hayes: it is very inconvenient for a
lot of students. but I would still
want it kept in effect.

Pat Kablach

Question: Can you point out the
most important issue in your
campaign?

Kablach: Being on the Allocations
Committee for two years now. I
have had the chance to see how
money is distributed. and i think
the priorities of the campus have
changed.

There is a lot of clamoring for
more programming and other
services that will not necessarily be
directed to special interest groups.
So I think we have to reorganize our

 

 

     

  

   
 
  

We

15¢‘

priorities on how the money is
spent.

The allocations money should be
spent like students want it. In that
reorganizing. we should take the
emphasis away from special
interest groups and put it into areas’
where it will affect a larger number
of students. '
Q What other areas are you
concerned with?

Kablach: There are many things
like the advising center that need
serious looking into. You see,
Student Government shouldn't just
be interested in social affairs, but
up to this point. they haven't used
their power effectively in the other
area.

Q How could you, as a Student
Government member, help revamp
the advising center? ’ '
Kablach: Ithink we must present a
position paper charging that the
Advising Center does not meet the
students’ needs. They should
change the way they hire advisors
by perhaps‘ giving Pitt. graduates
first priority. Also they must
assign students to advisors that are
in a relevant department.

You have to get the academic
committeesin the Faculty Senate
working on the problems with the
Advising Center. Once the faculty
is behind it. the Chancellor must do
something about it.

Bob Longwell

Q: What do you view as your

number one objective as a
candidate for Student Govern-
ment?

Longwell: I think the new Student
Government should come in with
the philosophy that all student
organizations should be united. To
quote one present SGB member.

they now feel “we hold the purse
strings and those are the facts of
life." I don't think the Board
should have that kind of control.
Q: What should the situation be
then? '

Longwell: I would like to see the
student organizations united be-
hind the different issues at the
University and 1 don't think we can
do it under the old criteria. Student
organizations have to get together
and work out the problems
together. It shouldn't be the
exception; it should be the rule.
Q: How do you intend to achieve
your ends?

Longwell: First Student Govern-
ment will have to meet with student
leaders of the different organiza-
tions and establish better com-
munications. It must be the kind of
relationship where they are calling
each other on the "phone and

saying. “There's a problem here-- A

let's see if we can get together and
work it out." Then harmony is
much better than when you simply
say. “We have the money so do as
we say."

One of the problems is that the
new Student Goverment Board
seems to inherit a bad reputation
from its predecessor. We have to
change all that.

Correction

We wish to correct an error
which appeared in an interview
with Ruth Weinhrom in Wednes-
day's paper. The interview should
have read: "Another problem is
the programming for dorm stu-
'dents. When only $200 (not S2000)
goes for programming for 3000
students it is not planned very
efficiently.

'-s"7r'catastrophe. The Administration's present position, most notably their

 Vrana’s information, however unwelcome, is also not true--upon

The Administration is to be faulted for our present inmnvenience and
the impending crisis with which we are all faced. Their insensitivity to
ward the striking union, local 29, and blatant attempts at manipulating
student_sympathies are reprehensible and irresponsible.

The University has had ample time to negotiate a settlement with the
janitors. They were notiﬁed by the union 60 days before the December
31 expiration of the janitors’ contract to set a date for talks. They
waited until the ﬁrst week in January. They were afforded an
additional two weeks by the janitors who worked from December 31 to
January 15 without a contract. _

The University should have taken responsible action before the .
contract expired to protect the needs of the students and avert this

withdrawal of all offers to the union, shows a disregard for those same
needs and seems to encourage a more serious catastrophe.

The actions of the Administration since the strike also shed a
questionable light on their ethics as well as their sense of
responsibility.

When the possibility of a shutdown in the Towers’ cafeteria loomed
closer, the University announced that students with meal tickets would
be reimbursed for meals they weren’t eating at a rate of 81 cents per
meal. What the University neglected to consider is that students who
bought smaller meal plans pay substantially rriore per meal than
students on the complete meal plan. Any reimbursements should be
made accordingly.

In a blatant attempt to win student sympathy for the University,
Director of Housing, John Vrana circulated a newsletter in the dorrm
announcing room  board rate increases next year to compensate for
the increase in the janitors’ salaries.

questioning, Vrana revealed the increase in room and board rates had
been scheduled prior to the strike. '

While the food supply runs short in the Towers, garbage cans
overﬂow and strikers threaten violence, two key members of the
Administration are out of town. Chancellor Posvar is in Harrisburg for
budget hearings, and Vice Chancellor of Operations, Joseph Dutton is
in Chicago for a convention.
We question what could possibly be more pressing in Harrisburg and
Chicago than the situation here on campus. .

Another demand is a better
pension plan. “The way it is now,“
one maid said, “you get 8 dollars a
month. 8 dollars. What good is
that?"

The food situation seemed on its
way to becoming a major problem
as striking workers kept food trucks
from making deliveries. “It’s
going to be had,” said Tuck Shop
manager Ida Emery. Asked if she
thought the Tuck Shop would be
forced to close, Emery replied, “As
things go, I guess so. We have no
milk, no bread, and as of tonight
we’ll have no more hamburgers or
chicken. It‘s tough.”

service workers. the situation
seemed equally dim. “Sure I'm
running out," said acting manager
Jeff Chaby. “The milk’s had. We
cut out the white milk." Manager
Dick Dearden said the food might
last “till Friday morning."

Although lines were longer than
usual due to the smaller work force,
the general feeling among students
seemed to be that the food was “as
good if not better” than normal.

Outside, striking workers re-
ferred to the student cafeteria help
as scabbers and said “they’re
defeating our purpose.”

strikers are successful in their

notified the administration 60 days
earlier to set up a date for contract
negotiatiations, but we didn’t
begin bargaining until the first
week in January.

“Thus this strike could have
been avoided had the University
acted sooner on our request.

“They finally made us an offer
four hours before the strike, then
withdrew it three hours later. We
had nothing to offer our members
thereby necessitating a strike."

The offer made was a 25 cent
increase per hour the first year and
a 20 cent increase each year for the
remainder fo the three year
contract.

During the meeting it was
announced an Ad Hoc Strike
Support Committee had been
formed by undergraduate and
graduate students, professionals

and faculty members who support

the strike.

Spokesman Steffie Brooks said,
“A meeting will be held Friday in
front ofthe Tuck Shop to picket and
distribute leaﬂets in support of the
strike. If the strike is not settled. a
meeting will be held Monday at 1
pm at 524 SU to discuss further

Executive Athletic Assistant Albert
E. Smith pointed to the curtailment
of recreation time as a result of the
strike. “We don't have anyone to
do anything." he said.

Inside the dormitories, one
student complained of the lack of
toilet paper, but felt the overall
situation wasn‘t very bad.
However, water damage caused by

“The administration is trying to

Twenty of us met with John Vrana,

director of University Housing,_

today, and he told us room and
board would be going up next term
regardless of the strike.

“We too are trying to get
students organized to prevent this

Student Government President
Rege Kaufman chaired the meeting
and said, “Legal action will be
taken against the University if it
does not fulﬁll its obligations to the

Jeff Chaby, chairman of the

“Tramp"Cames to Oakland

BY HARRIS LEVY

A series of ﬁlms by one of the
cinema's finest artists. Charles
Chaplin, will be shown at the
Carnegie Lecture Hall by the Film
Section of the Museum of Art.
Chaplin, besides being one of the
most talented people ever to work
in film is also one of the most well
known. Surely everyone would
recognize his inimitable cramp
ﬁgure with derby, cane, and
mustache.

The classic Chaplin ﬁlms have
been rarely shown in recent years
and the series of ten programs to
be shown on successive Friday
evenings presents a rare oppor-

, tunity for area viewers. The cost of

admission for students is also
relatively inexpensive, as a series
ticket is available for $10, and
tickets for individual shows will
cost students $1.25.

The first program, which was
shown last Friday consisted of
Chaplin’s first feature, The Kid
(1921), and the short, The ldle

' Class (1921).

Tonight’s program, The Chaplin
Revue, includes three shorts, A
Dog's Life (1918), Shoulder Arms
(1918), and The Pilgrim (1922).
They will be shown in the Lecture
Hall at 8:00 and 10:15.

The authorized version of The
Gold Rush, (1925) which includes a
musical score and narration by
Chaplin will be screened at 8:00
and 10:00 on January 25. The Gold
Rush is perhaps Chaplin's most

famous feature. Also on the
program is the 1922 short Pay Day.

The Circus (1928) and the short,
The Immigrant (1917), are to be
shown at 8:00 and 10:00 on
February 1. The Circus like the
Gold Rush, has a musical score.

After most ﬁlmmakers converted
to talking pictures, Chaplin pro-
longed the use of the art of
pantomine in his features like City
Lights (1931) and Modern Times
(1936), both with musical scores.
Modern Times also has songs sung
by the Tramp. City Lights will be
screened on February 8 at 8:00 and
10:00; Modern Times is to be
shown at 8:00 and 10:00 on
February 15.

Chaplin's ﬁrst talking ﬁlm was
the satire. The Great Dictator, in
which he played both Adenoid
Hynkel, the dictator of Tomania,
and a Jewish barber. It will be
shown on February 22 at 8:00 and
10:15.

Chaplin’s next film was the 1947 A

Monsieur Verdoux subtitled, “a
comedy of murders”; it will be
shown on March 1 at 8:00 and
10:15. The film contains diabolic

humor, bitter satire and social’

criticism 1 wrote Chaplin in his
brilliant My Autobiography (1964),
in which he also called Monsieur
Verdoux “his cleverest and most
brilliant film I have yet made.”

March 8 (at 8 and 10 pm) will
mark the premiere showing of
Chaplin's last starring feature, A
King in New York (1957).

The final film in the series is
Limelight (1952) to be shown on
March 15 at 8:00 and 10:45. This
film, which was the last film that
Chaplin made in America finds him
portraying an English music hall
clown. The film had very limited
bookings when it was originally
released and as they did not
include the Los Angeles area, the
film did not qualify for an Academy
Award. However, when the film
was re-released in 1972, it played
in Los Angeles and earned the
Academy Award for best original
musical score. Chaplin’s co-stars
in the film are Claire Bloom and
Buster Keaton, the equal of
Chaplin as a silent comedy director
and performer, but one who did not
have the opportunities such as
Chaplin did in the sound film era.

Chaplin’s films are well worth
seeing. The series presented at the
Carnegie Lecture Hall shows
Chaplin’s transformation from
great silent clown to social satirist.
Any Chaplin film is probably worth
seeing and his best films (of the
ones that I have seen, 1 like The
Gold Rush most) rank with the best
ever produced. This series
presents readers with an unusual
chance to see the work of this
controversial artist. Chaplin’s
films have both humorous and
serious qualities. Though the cost
of admission is slightly higher than
that of movies run at Pitt, it is far
lower that that of commercial
theaters and art of this quality is a
bargain at nearly any price.

Write-in Seeks SG Presidency

BY
RICHARD SWARTZ

Contemplating such innovative
notions as a student tuition strike

«and a revolving Student Govern- »

ment Board (SGB), Jeff Sekerka
announced his write-in candidacy
for SG President.

Sekerka is centering his cam-
paign on the development of a new,
more favorable image of Student
Government than has existed in
past administrations. Citing a lack
of activity in the areas of
continuity. organization, and com-
munication, Sekerka offered var-
ious proposals designed to inject
fresh life into Student Government
proceedings. A

“One of the major problems is
the absence of communication
between the various student

p organizations,” Sekerka observed.

“For instance, other universities
have ~been'able to carry off tuition
strikes because students weren’t
intent on keeping within their
factions. Here at Pitt, tuition is a
serious concern for most students,
but "there’s a stigma as far as the
communication between these fac-
tions goes.”

Another obstruction lies in the
area of continuity, according to
Sekerka, in reference‘ to the
different aims of out-going and
in-coming Student Government‘
representatives. He has suggested
retaining two members of an old
Board to actively serve with a new
one, in order that a systematic
transition could be effected regard-
ing majorprojects.

“At leastrif they couldn’t have
formal voting powers and duties,
thought should be given to letting
them serve in an advisory
capacity,” Sekerka said. “As it
stands now, there just isn’t any
carry-over between one Board and
the next.”

Sekerka accentuated the need for
student involvement, terming
motivation “the whole key”.

The Mayor’s refusal to return to

gcouncilmanic order, yet, while
maintaining de juris opposition to

indicated a willingness to let‘ the

But Council Public Safety Chair-
man Eugene DePasquale plans to
act on the Uptown residents’
opposition and query the Mayor
about the subject at next week’s
Council meeting. DePasquale is
especially dissatisfied with traffic
jams and lack of access for
emergency vehicles.

However Robert Zepfel, mana-
ger of the Freedom House
ambulance service, sees no difﬁ-
culty in navigating the one-way
streets. “We ﬁnd we have more
mobility because we're working
with four lanes instead of two."

more co—ordination in '

Through seminars, news articles,
and other avenues of publicity, he
hopes to impart a semblance of
legitimacy to Student Government
demands, particularly regarding
tuition.

Regarding allocations, the write-

in candidate believes the Pitt
Hockey Club and the Studio
Theater should receive higher

considerations monetarily. and that
with organized student support,
could conceivably pressure the

Board into releasing adequate
funding.
He also criticized Student

Government for “alienating for
black students" as far as soliciting
their opinions on the issue of
programming and advocated
scheduling more noteworthy
speakers and entertainers in the
upcoming year.

Trashcan Fire Erupts

In SU; Cause Unknown

In the middle of the janitors

overflowing trash can in the men’s

sea WM... Support
In Pitt-Janitors Dispute,

BY BRIAN DUNN

The Student Government Board
take a stand in
support of either the University or
the union during the Service Union
strike. aecording to SGB President
Rege Kaufmann.

In a closed executive session

‘Wednesday, the Board decided it

was “impossible to be sure as to
who is right and who is ‘wrong in
the strike.”

The Board called a meeting
Thursday evening to educate the
public on the strike issues.

Representatives of the union and .

the University were invited to
speak.

“The students are the people
being hurt,” said Kaufmann.
“When we enter into a contract
with the school, we expect our
rights to be fulfilled. Until we have
more information, we’ll just push
for a speedy settlement.”

When asked if the SGB would be -

able to take a stand after
Thursday's meeting, Kaufmann
replied, “That's possible. but

probably not that soon."

. The executive session followed a
general Board meeting, during
which ‘Kaufmann opened the floor
for student opinions and proposals
concerning the strike. ‘

Mark Satinoff, SGB candidate on
the Pitt Young Socialist campaign,
said the SGB “should unequi-
vocally support the strike."

Satinoff offered three proposals
to the Board and the student body
in general:

“First, a mass meeting should
be called, initiated by the Student
Government, to educate students
on the issues of the strike,

feeling killers. One of the most
memorable scenes in Dirty Harry
was Callahan calmly munching
a hot dog and foiling a robbery
attempt. This time he's calmly
munching a hamburger and foils a
skyjacking. Some difference.

And then there's Callahan, the
supermale. so tough he doesn't
even want a local anesthetic while
getting stitches in his face. And of
course women throw themselves at
his feet, quite literally. Screen-
writer John Milius, also responsi-
ble for the story. has made a career
of creating such macho types, like
Jerimiah Johnson and Life and
Times of Judge Roy Bean and
sometimes his male image is
downright laughable.

it's all too easy to find fault with
the film. The ending is
preposterous. Sex and violence
scenes are stuck in with no bearing
Characterization is
shallow at best. And the “action"
sequences are so clicheed by now
that they're boring.

But in spite of the ridiculously
structured story, the film remains
one of the most terrifying to ever
hit the screen [certainly more
frightening than the tale of a
simpering pre-adolescent devil
spewing green vinyl vomit]. One
shot, of a menacing line of black
leather-clad motorcycle cops
threatening Callahan is one of the
most chilling sights on film, not
unlike the terror of a similar line-up
of crows in The Birds.

It's one of those rare films that
manages to inspire a gripping
paranoia, seemingly by accident.
But the clutter of needless corpses
and the male identity problem of
the leading character hampers
what could have been a first-rate
suspense thriller. Like the gun of
its title, Magnum Force lacks any
vestige of subtlety.

Turing to the other side of the law
(and vice is always more interest-
ing than ivirture). subtlety plays a
very important part. Especially
when you're dealing with a crew of
con men like in The Sting.

When it was announced that the

Films Investigate Both Sides Of Law

Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was
banding together for another ﬂick,
lovers of blue eyes and film fans in
general. eagerly awaited the
results. But don't try to compare
the two. Cassidy's success was
hinged on the spirited interplay
between two dynamic actors.
tottering on a not-so-great plot.
The Sting is just the opposite, in
that it does not rely on only two
characters (who really get little
interplay) and has a relatively
respectable storyline. The two
high priced actors have only "one
scene together of any note (which
of course is one of the flick's best).

The story concerns the plottings of
a band of Depression-era con men,
or “grifters," led by ace Henry
Gondorff (Paul Newman) in a “Big
Con" to swindle rackets leader
Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw) out
of a quarter million dollars. The
particular target was requested by
Johnny Hocker (Robert Redford).
whose long time partner was
ordered killed by Lonnegan.

Okay, so it isn’t the stuff that
great films are made of.
Admittedly, it's highly romanti-
cized. All the con men [the good
guys], are made glamorous, living
by their wits and dashing good
looks, who pick only on the nasties
of society for their schemes and not
the good citizens. And the villians
are short-tempered, dull-witted
characters, usually with some
physical handicap or exaggeration
who have to resort to violence on
people who meant them no harm.

So escapist entertainment, here
we come. Director George Roy Hill
has handled it more lightly than
Cassidy wisely avoiding any
emphasis on the few moments of
pseudo-drama that
counters.

And there are a couple ' prize
scenes. The f1rst‘is the initial
meeting of Hooker and Gondorff.
Expectedly. Newman plays the
hard,-drinking voice-of-experience
to Redford's brash. cynical kid who
will still go along with anything
Newman says. A little something
for the Cassidy fans. who don't get
much else to remind them of that
flick.

Tracksters Host KSU
In Lone  H0me Meet

BY RICK STOUFFER

When the Pitt Tracksters meet
Kent State at the Field House

‘tomorrow it will be Coach Jim

Banner's first real test of his
“progressing" team.

“Kent State is a campus school,”
said Banner, taking a few short
minutes from drilling his boys,
“they have a lot of depth in most
places and they always have a few
standouts.”

One of these standouts is Gerald
Tinker. a runner for Kent State.
Tinker was ‘on our '72 Olympic
team in Munich and a gold medal
winner in the 4 by 400 event but
Pitt may be spared seeing his
ability.

“Tinker is a very good runner but
it is possible he won't be running
tomorrow,” said Banner. “He
hasn’t run in any of the major
events so far this year so you can’t
really tell. Another Olympian is
Jock Aachenbrea. He was a weight
thrower at Munich for the French
and will be throwing shot tomor-
row.”

But State isn't made of only two
people. Banner went on. “Last
year Kent State won the Mid
America conference in track which
can give you some kind of idea of
what they can do. We'll be running
NCAA order of events for this
meet in order to let more of our
boys try to qualify for the Eastern
Regionals and for the NCAA. The
competition will be tough but we
wanted the meet to gain those
qualifying times."

Fan support is always a welcome
sight for coaches and Banner
seemed pleased with support in the
past from Pitt students.

‘.‘I’m very happy with the support
from the student body. We always
get good support for meets

especially our invitational
Invitational January 25 and 26 at
the Field House]. We're hoping for

that good support tomorrow be-'

cause we’ll need it.”

Generally if a coach is asked for a
prediction on the outcome of a meet
he breaks out in a cold sweat and
stammers while walking away.
Banner was not that bad.

.“It's too hard to predict the

outcome of a meet, the factors to be
weighed are too varied. We have
been very lucky being almost void
of injuries going into this meet."

Then with a half smile he added. “I
think we're prepared for this
meet." “Progress" marches on.

Penguins
Trade
Rutherford

BY RON SIEGEL
SPORTS EDITOR

Newly appointed Pittsburgh
Penguin General Manager Jack
Button made his second major deal
in less than 24 hours yesterday by
trading goaltender Jim Rutherford
and defenseman Jack Lynch to the
Detroit Red Wings for defenseman
Ron Stackhouse.

Button traded defenseman Bryan
Watson and left wing Greg Polis to
St. Louis Wednesday in exchange
for defensemcn Ab l)cmarco and
Steve Durbano, and left wing Bob
“Battleship" Kelly.

Rutherford, who came to Pitts-
burgh from Detroit several years
ago, was notilied of the trade just
before the Pens’ flight to Van-
couver was scheduled to depart.
Lynch has been playing with the
Penguins AHL affiliate, the Her-
shey Bears for most of the season.

Stackhouse is a 6-3, 200-pounder,
who played with the California
Seals before being traded to Detroit
in 1971.

Demarco and l)urbano will join
.‘$tackhou.se in adding a new
dimension to the Penguins de-
fense, brawn. Dcmarco is 6-0, l85,
while Durbano, who has shattered
many leagues‘ penalty records, is
()-l, 210 pounds.

While Kelly lacks the size of other
new Penguins, his penalty marks
take a back seat to nobody. He
spent 20!; minutes in the pokey last
season while playing in the AHL.

All of the new players will join
the team in Vancouver for tonight's
game with the ('anucks (H155 pin),
with the exception of Demarco,
who has been sent to New York for

a shoulder examination and will
join the team in Philadelphia
Sunday.

Comes In
Small
Package

((10/iii/1/wrl from Page 9)

tlemyer could have gone to any
school. His choice of Pitt reveals
yet something else about the man.

“I want to get an education both
in the classroom and on the mats.
And while I want to go to the top, I
also want to be a part of building
something. The last two schools I
had to choose from were Clurion--
ranlted seventh in the nation--and
Pitt. I feel Pitt is a program
working its way up and I want to be
a part of it.”

Rande Stottlemycr is a “small
package" in stature alone.

Racke ts Fizzle Against Cubs

BY DAVE FOUST

The Slippery Rock junior varsity
committed the same basic error
that George Washington University
decided upon last Wednesday
night at Fitzgerald Field House
when they showed for the
scheduled contest. A forfeit would
have been less embarrassing as the
junior Panthers muscled Slippery
Rock 93-54 in providing a preview

of what was to happen in the »

upcoming hour and a half.
Defense is a term that seems to be
going out of style with the Pitt
basketball program and was once
again evident as the junior
Panthers wasted no time in putting
their aggressive brand of point

making into high gear. After only
five minutes ofplay Pitt held a 14-7
advantage and the only escape for
Slippery Rock was to get off the
court via a time-out.

Pitt managed to force so many
turnovers with its “defense," that
the little Panthers had the bulk of
their 93 points from run and shoot
brand of basketball. The size
advantage that the little Panthers
possessed was hardly a factor in
the first half as a three-guard
trapping and stunting offense
gained ball possession and points.

Slippery Rock could not put an
offense together because they were
too busy trying to get away from
Panther little people without losing
the ball. Slippery Rock substituted

The University of Pittsburgh Student
Government Programming Committee

presents:

en masse’ to get the ball near the
goal, but to no avail. The half
ended with a 47-21 Pittsburgh
advantage.

Slippery Rock began to break the
Panther’s press and managed to
get near the basket for some
percentage shooting where they
were greeted by the likes of Wayne
Talbott, Mark Disco, Scott Stevens,
and Lous Kelly who took command
of nearly everything that dared to
venture within fifteen feet of the
basket. ’

The race horse tempo of the Pitt
attack began to take its toll on
Slippery Rock. Bob Shrewsbury

and Scott Nedrow aided by Frank
Boyd persisted in fast breaking
lay—ups and short jumpers while

 

Robert Haygood delighted his
football following with the long
jumpers that earned 18 points and
high scorer for the night.

Randy Lloyd and Eugene Jones
began picking up points for
Slippery Rock as Pitt rebounders
were unable to put two hands on
rebounding basketballs. Pitt began
to slow the game down with eight
minutes remaining but was unable
to work out anything that resem-
bled a pattern offense. Slippery
Rock continued desperation shots
but was unable to narrow the forty
point disadvantage.

 Ieers Practice With

Mountaneers, 18-4

If Purdue outclassed the Pitt
Hockey Club earlier in January. it
would have to have been the same
when the skaters met West
Virginia last Sunday night at the
Sewickl_v Ice Arena. Pitt put the
punch on the Mounties by an 18-4
margin in what amounted to little
more than a practice session.

It could have been more of contest
ifthe WVU squad had their regular
netminder available. For reasons
not disclosed, the Mounties num-
ber one goalie didn't show and the
Pitt skaters proceeded to make a
swiss cheese out of the backup
WVU goaler.

Pitt will not resume Western PA
Intercollegiate Hockey Association
action until January 27, when they
will meet Duquesne for the first
time this year at the Civic Arena.
The “extra ice time” of the WVU
game was welcomed by the Pitt
skaters, who now must make due
with just their two regular practices
each week.

Freshmen Paul Shemansky
started in goal for Pitt. playing two
fine periods before giving way to
John ‘De Fazio in the third.
Shemansky won't be stopping
pucks for the next few weeks,
however. Pitt defensement Duke
Shaeffer put Shemansky out of
commission with a knee injury
when the two were involved in a
“pick-up session” down at Panther
Hollow during the colder weather
earlier in the week.

Pitt now holds down second. place
in the WPIHA, just two points
behind Carnegie-Me1lon.. The
Tartans have yet to lose a game
although they have not experienced
their victories without some difﬁ-
culties. ' .

St. Vincent College finally broke
into the win column this week? by
defeating Penn State~ [McKee-
sport], 3-0. That loss put the PSU
in third place, two points behind Pit
and four points ahead of Duquesne,
Indiana and St. Vincent, all of
whom are tied for fourth place with
just two points.

WPIHA in goals scored with 39 in

  Gillman To Coach Oilers  

Again Next

HOUSTON AP -- Houston Oiler
General Manager Sid Gillman. who
said at the end of the season he had
coached his last game. announced
Thursday he had changed his mind
and would coach professional
football's worst team again in 1974.

Gillman. who fired Bill Peterson
after the fifth game last year. also
announced that defensive co-
ordinator Burnie Miller and defen-
sive line coach Bruce Beatty. were
no longer with the club.

Gillman also announced that
public relations director Dan
Downs had been elevated to
assistant general manager.

"l‘ve told you before from time
to time that I wasn't going to do
it." Gillman told a news con-
ference. "but I've changed my
mind."

Gillman said one reason for the
tumabout was a petition from a
group of Oilers asking him to
remain as coach. .

“A second big reason is our
desire to maintain continuity."
Gillman said. “Hopefully now we

Season

can have some stability in our
organization and in our football."

He declined to say how long he
will remain as coach or if he had a
replacement in mind but he hoped
the new coach would be from the
Oiler staff.

A possibility from the OiIer's in if

present staff could be former Rice

All-American King Hill. a 12-year

pro quarterback and quarterback
