. Center? Near Adoption

by LEE TERKEL

The proposal to allocate funds for the establishment of a
Citizen Information Center (CIC) will be acted upon in the very
near future by the‘ Senate of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.

The CIC, if formed, will ad-
dress itself to the following tasks:
(1) to collect voting records and
public statements of all candi-
dates and have them available on

. an “as requested” basis.

(2) to contact all candidates
seeking public office whose con-
stituency includes all or partof
Allegheny County to see if they
desire to have students partici-
pate in their campaign P

(3) to have available voting
regulations and to assist in their
clarification

(4) to collect data to facili-
,tate academic research on the
electoral process.

» Chancellor Wesley Posvar
ileased a statement concern-
jng the CIC. He recognized the

/University’s role as a forum of

 free political discussion and
warned that its adoption of a
political stance would run

counter to this role. ‘_

_ Furthermore, the statement
emphasized that political ab-
sention of‘ this nature is re-
quired if the University is to
remain a recipient of govern-
ment aid, since the use of pub-
lic funds to finance a candidacy
is illegal. '

The Executive Committee of

Saga Policies Outlined

by SHERRI ZIPPAY

As a result of a review of food
service proposals submitted to
Bernard Kobosky, Vice Chancel-
lor for Student Affairs, and John
Vrana. Director of University
Housing. three food service com-
mittees were established.

The Director of University
Housing serves as chiefiliaison
officer with the campus food

_service. During the past year‘

when competitive bids were
sought for the food service oper-
ation and Saga Food Service was
awarded the campus contract
for another year, Vrana proposed
to Kobosky that a general food
service policy committee and
two working subcommittees be
created so that student opinion
could have a direct effect on all
campus food service operations.

One subcommittee would be
concerned with the boarding
food service operation and the
other with non-boarding cafeter-
ias. snack bars. and vending.
After reviewing the proposal,
Kobosky approved it and asked
Vrana to establish the commit-
tees.

According to Vrana, “It is our
intention that the subcommittees
will indeed be working commit-
tees conducting on-going inspec-
tions and ‘evaluations of food

Clarification of Politics

service activities in their respec-
tive areas, and raising import-
ant issues and concerns with the

appropriate food service mana-

gersf’

“It is hoped,” he stated, “that
the food service working com-
mittees will meet biweekly and
that the food service policy com-
mittee will meet monthly. The
food service policy committee
will review reports from the
working committee, discuss and
implement policy changes, and

solve problems which the work- _

ing committees bring to their

attention. However, most of the-

work and involvement in food
service decision making will
come from the working subcom-
mittees where student member-
ship is a majority,” be con-
cluded;

‘The membership of the .three
committees shall consist of the
following:

i I. Food Service
Policy Committee

A. Director of University Hous-
ing - Chairman
B. Director of Campus Food
Service ’
C. Associate Director of Hous-

A SDS Splintered

Spring and summer of 1969

‘saw a splintering of the nation-

al organization of Students for
a Democratic Society (SDS).
The Pitt chapter of the SDS was
forced to clarify its political posi-
tion by the arrival in Pittsburgh
of members of the radical
“Weatherman” faction of the SDS.

The result was a clarifica-

tion and affirmation of previous.

stands on the part of the Pitt
SDS, rather than a massive
change.’Out of the turmoil, the
Revolutionary Socialist Union
(RSU) rose to replace the SDS
at the University. I

The RSU strongly believes.
according to Paul Leblanc. a
member, that students must re-
late to the problems of the work-
ers in this country. Since the
students must inevitably join
the labor force and must there-
fore interest themselves in it,
the RSU insists that working
class support is essential in the
struggle for meaningful social
change.

The RSU has since been ‘ in-
volved in several national and
regional actions supporting work-
ers and protesting the war in
Vietnam. They _ have been ex-
tremely active in the struggle
of the Hospital Workers to
unionize, the California Grape
Boycott, and the demonstration
of the« Black Construction Co-

  

    

of student support. In order
to better. acquaint the mem-
bers of the University commun-
ity with its programs and poli-
cies the RSU has undertaken an
extensive series of films and
speakers to be presented this
term.’

” Among the speakers to be
presented this term, will be

Edward Boorstein, an American
Marxist economist, yon Socialism
in Cuba, (Oct. 22); Charlene
Mitchell, 1968 communist party
candidate for President, who will
speak on Black Liberation and
Socialism; A Communist View
(November 4); and Paul Boutelle,
who will give a Trotskyite view
of black liberations (November
5).

SG , Concerts Changed

Despite the recent cancella-
tion of the September concert
and the rescheduling of Novem-
ber's, the Student Government
(SG) Concert-a-Month Commit-
tee intends on continuing to pro-
vide as varied an entertainment
base as possible. The Concert-a-

. Month places a limited financial

backing in a centralized enter-
tainment acc\‘oun—t for organiza-
tions on campus in an attempt
to obtain a broad cross-section
of entertainment.

SG President Lenny Klavonic
stated that the concert schedul-
ed for Saturday night, a Blues
Festival, headlining James Tay-
lor, was scratched because Tay-
lor is presently engaged in film-
ing a movie, and time and avail-
ability of a decent group made
rescheduling the concert during
September impossible.

Although the November con-
cert was originally supposed to
be Chicago, in a combined ef-
fort by SG and the Student
Union Board, contractual com-
plications, lack of adequate fa-
cility, and promotional prob-
lems forced cancellation. In-
stead the Concert-a-Month is
working on a concert scheduled

Oakland Co-Op  

A Free Barter Store Tone

(Editor's Note: John Bradley, local spokesman for
the Oakland Co-Operative Store, describes the func-

‘tions of the establishment and outlinesits methods

and goals.)
by JOHN BRADLEY
Since last winter a group of students, faculty,

and community people have been organizing the

Oakland Co-operative Association. Within two
weeks, the consumer owned store will open at 3601
Blvd. of the Allies, at Ward St. V

A consumer’s co-operative is a non-profit serv-
ice set up for its members. Anyone can join and
each member has one vote regardless of how many
shares of capital he ownes.

To become a member requires the purchase of
one share at ten dollars and payment of the one
dollar application fee. A

The shares provide the capital for stocking the
store. The “profits” or savings of the store are re-
turned to the members in the form of a patronage
refund, in accordance with their purchases rather
than capital ownership.

Anyone can shop in the store following a discount
pricing policy but only a member is eligible for a
patronage refund.

NEEDS
The need of consumer co-operation stems from
four basic realities which diminish the value of the
consumer’s dollars. '

First, in many areas of retailing, mark-ups of
over 50 per cent are common. By selling at discount
prices with a maximum mark-up of 25 per cent,
considerable savings can be realized.

Second, many stores carry and stock a variety
of similar products. This means additional capital
and inventory costs that must be passed along to
the consumer. By judicious and non-repetitive pro-
duct selection, the co-op can reduce costs and in-
crease member savings.

Third, the enormous variety of products avail-
able on the market defies the individual consum-
er’s ability to shop wisely. Few consumers have the
time or resources to be fully knowledgeable about
more than a few of their purchases. With consumer

co-operation expert information will be available in

all areas of consumer expenditure.

And finally, what the establishment deters
fraud and deception. The co-op feels that the best
consumer protection is consumer ownership and
control.

The Oakland Co-op is already doing business in
a wide range of items at considerable savings: auto
tires, basic clothing, underwear, hosiery, dry
goods, camping equipment, school supplies, small
appliances, photo supplies, etc.

The co-op has been holding occasional Saturday
outdoor fairs in the backyard of its president, Prof.
Ray Richman, and in the Glen Hazel public hous-

V

ing project area. When the store is opened, addition-
al goods will eventually be carried: winter clothing,
books (especially on ecology, foods, etc.) textbooks,
dairy products, organic foods, housewares an
hardware, etc. I

Eventually the co-op hopes to open a gas station

P and auto repair services, a co-op pharmacy, and

other services. The development of additional serv-

ices depends on membership. As the co-op grows,-

we hope that the model of consumer control can be
applied to a wide range of services, from newspa-
pers to medical services and co-op housing

MORE THAN STORE
The founders and members of the Oakland Co-
op see it as more than just a store. The co-op has a
social purpose equally important as the economic.

The co-op hopes to sponsor educational and cul-
tural activities, arts and crafts, a photographic dark-
room and eventually printing facilities, an “ecology
action” of waste recycling, and other things that
groups of members may want to undertake.

In addition to these activities the co-op is work-
ing closely withthe Metropolitan Tenants Organiza-
tion in an effort to set up buying clubs in the public
housing projects.

The co-op is developing the capability to provide
technical assistance to other community groups
who want to set up their own consumer controlled
services. The co-op also hopes to serve as a ve-
hicle for people who want to undertake projects in
the community.

DEPENDS ON PARTICIPATION

The development and the social and economic
success of the co-op depend on the enthusiasm and
participation of the members. The co-op needs help
in a wide range of its activities; the consumer edu-
cation committee, the membership and publicity
committee, the monthly newsletter, the arts and
crafts committee, the store operations committee,
and other activities. ’

In additiog, the co-op and its members can bene-
fit from people who have had experience (or just
want to learn) in the various areas of the co-ops’
operations. '

The Pitt Campus Co-op Organizing Committee

- will hold an organizing meeting on Wednesday, Sept.

16, at 4 :30 p.m. in room 306 of the Student Union.

Students. staff, and faculty interested in work-
ing on the co-op, joining it, or just rapping about
co—ops should come to the meeting. People unable to
attend the meeting but who want additional inform-
ation should call John Bradley, 421-3795.

YAF Convenes For

Tenth Anniversary

by FRANK DONATELLI

This week (Sept. 9-12) over
500 members of the Young Ameri-
cans for Freedom (YAF) met in
Connecticut to celebrate the tenth
anniversary of the founding of the
organization. The group spent the
first three days at the University
of Hartford hearing speeches and
participating in workshops. The
fourth day was spent at the estate
of columnist and editor William
F. Buckley, Jr.

The participation represented
over 40 states and the vast major-
ity of those attending were of col-
lege age. The Pittsburgh contigent
numbered 15, three of whom were
from the University. Other col-
leges represented from -the Pitts-
burgh area included Duquesne,
Point Park, and Chatham.

The program began Wednesday
evening. Waggonner Carr, former
attorney general of Texas, told the
YAF that “the greatest challenge
to you is to seek out and oppose
those of your generation who
would destroy America.” There
followed a discussion of conser-
vatism as it relates to Western
civilization and American tradi-
tion by Professor George C.
Roche, III, author John Chamber-
lain, editor Jameson G. Cam-
paigne, Sr., and Douglas Caddy, a
founder of YAF. The evening was
capped with an address by Na-
tional Review publisher William
Rusher.

Thursday and Friday consisted
mostly of participating in work-
shops on such topics as political
action, journalism, the academy,
and counteracting the New Left
on campus.

Perhaps the highlight of the
conference was the Thursday eve-
ning speech by Senator Barry
Goldwater of Arizona. After re-
ceiving a 20 minute standing

ovation, Senator Goldwater told
the crowd that “the greatest
threat to individual freedom in
America is the growth of govern-
ment bureaucracy." Senator
Goldwater was also presented
with the first of three “Man” of
the Decade" awards given by
YAF to the outstanding conserva-
tive leaders of the past ten years.

Others receiving “Man of the
Decade“ awards were California
Governor Ronald Reagan and Wil-
liam F. Buckley, Jr.

On Saturday, the scene shifted
to the estate of William Buckley
at Sharon, Conn. After a tour of
the grounds, the group heard ad-
dresses by Buckley and humorist
Al Capp.

Evaluating the whole affair,
YAF Executive Director Randal
Teague called it “a watershed for
the conservative movement.”

Tommy Lee: Man In Demand

by LORETTA HORRELL

Tom Lee is a man in great de-
mand, and if your are interested
in talking with him, the effort to
put forth to find him will be quite
rewarding.

This Pitt senior is as amiable
as he is diverse. His many
achievements in music and photo-
graphy are balanced by his hu-

mor, magnetic personality. and _

sincere compassion toward his
fellow man.

His background is as diverse as
his music. He has called many
places home, including Hong
Kong, Brazil. and. since 1966.
the United States.

At one time, Tom had planned
to go into medicine. Now, in his
senior year, he is majoring in mu-
sic. After graduation he plans a
career in advertising because he
thinks “music is a very depress-
ing profession.”

Tom plays the flute and so-
prano saxophone. He is a member
of Pitt’s jazz band and has per-
formed with them on television
and for local organizations. Last
spring the music department
sponsored him and a group of stu-
dents in the intercollegiate jazz
festival at Notre Dame in Indiana.
Tom won first place as flute solo-
ist. He plans to attend the festival
again in the spring.

Hostility

large elements of society have i

become increasingly hostile to the
academic community due large-

AA ly to demonstrations and dis-

ruptions on campus. A Gallup Poll

taken after “the student strike re-
vealed that 82 per cent—of the

over-2l population opposed the

~ ln the last few years there has
been on campus an effort to put
theory into practice, in fact, into
direct action. As a result, thinkers
have come to be seen as a real
threat by certain regressive ele-
ments.

Education, previously identified
in the minds of many "middle
Americans with social lmobility
for their children, ‘has come today

—. to be regarded with suspicion and

some contempt.'"~The value of dis-
sent and its subtle role in the po-
litical T process eludesx many of
these people; the political dem-
onstrations inspires the lament,
“ls this what wesend our chil-
dren to college for?” A

Re-Evaluation Needed
Given this, it may be time for
the activist students to reevaluate
their tactics. Is the university real-
ly an appropriate target‘ for seri-

ous political action? And are dem- '

onstrations and disruptions lnot
now becoming counterproductive?

Consider the first ‘question.
Demonstrations are beginning to
seriously hurt the schools. Equally
important, attacks against the
schools can have only a marginal
effect on the Ainstitutions and
forces in society that are really re-
gressive. ‘ A

If activists feel that demonstra-
tions are still valid, they miaht
consider restricting their use to
more appropriate targets—such

as military installations, induction ,

stations, corporations guilty of
major pollution, and the arms in-

T. dustry.

Correction _
The universities,-forﬁall their
faults, have made serious efforts

Another’ View

to correct abuses in their struc-

A tures. They are probably the fair-

est and most decent institutions in
society. And, activists might re-
member, they were the cradle of
the movement.

In considering the second ques-
tion, that is, the value of dem-
onstrations to the movement, ac-
tivists must understand that op-
portunist and regressive politi-

1 cians feed on them. It is easy for

politicians with nothing to say
otherwise, to create for them-
selves a demogogic appeal by de-
nouncing students for demonstra-
tionsi Attacking students involves
none of the hard and possibly un-
popular decisions a legislator
must make in weighing the claims,
of competing interest groups and
in deciding issues.

lt is a cheap avenue to popu-

larity for the mediocre; it might

notbe too inaccurate'.to say that
Mr. Reagan was elected in Cali-
fornia by radical students. Perhaps

_it is time for the movement to be-

gin to ask itself whether it wants
to. make -things so easy for these
gentlemen.‘

road of cop—out.

I do not believe a word coming
from anyone working for Nixon.
Fewer restraints on campuses‘?
Bullshit. What about IRS "guide-
lines" which would threaten uni-
versity tax-exempt status for di-

Letter
Policy

Letters to the Pitt News must
carry the full name of the writ-
er and the signee's school or
address. Letters should be type-
written, triple-spaced. There is
no stipulation placed a n
length, but all letters are sub-
ject to condensation by the edi-
tors.

Any letter which in the
views of the Pitt News editors
tends to libel, scandalize, or
falls outside the rules of what
we see as journalistic ethics
will not be published.

It good reason is shown by a
reader who sends a letter, why
their name should be with-
held, the Pitt News will oblige.
But good reason must be
shown. We reserve the right to
withhold the names of letter
writers, but we must know
who the party is, and how
they can be reached if neces-
sary.

No pen names will be used,
but the name of an organiza-
tion can be used in the signa-
ture, if that organization is
known to us.

I'll tell you what I've tound out

may be adventurous . . . ad-

"Destroy Police Myth”

by LENNY KLAVONIC
SG President

During the week of Sept. 21,
the Student Government Legal
Awareness Committee in conjunc-
tion with campus security will
sponsor a program designed to
acquaint students with the prob-
lems‘, duties, and attitudes of se-
curity officers, and allow the se-
curity police a chance to better
understand the University stu-
dent, his ideals and behavior.

as anti-youth.

 

KLAVONIC

The program will take on an individualized ap-
proach, placing security officers and students on a
one—to-one basis, where each can gain understand-
ing and insight through close personal contact.

The student will be afforded the opportunity to

Western Psychiatric Hospital or elsewhere on cam-
pus, where he can understand the scope of the cam-
pus security operation and relate to the officers he
is assigned to in open conversation and free expres-
sion of views. The student will be assigned to the
security officer for a two-hour period to ensure that
as many students as possible can become involved.

CONSISTENCY

Consistent with the concept of the University
community, where various facets of the University
interact, the security officer can also be regarded
as an integral working member of the community,
responsible to the mutual interests of the educa-
tional institution.

The common interest should place the security
officer in an entirely different light from the city or
federal police officer, yet circumstances have dic-
tated that a sizable portion of the student commun-
ity still regards him as not concerned with the wel-
fare of the student and the University, but out to
“bust” as many students as possible for whatever
charges can be levied. I

to them.

Events such as Kent State, Jackson State, the
Washington Moratorium. where confrontation with
police has resulted in violence, injury and death,
and the increasing harrassment on the part of law
enforcement agencies of college students has re-
sulted in the stereotyped image of the police officer

SYMBOLIC STATUS

Recent murders of police in major U.S. cities,
coupled with the violence that has recently plagued
this country, have given long hair, eccentric beha-
vior, and feaky clothing the status of symbols of a
movement, which not understood by middle—class
Americans, have resulted in condemnation of those
who freely express.

The rationale for attempting a program with
students and security police is that existing condi-
tions have forced individuals into a pattern of
thought where pre-established ideas prevent com-
munication and cooperation to mutual advantage.

One of the major goals of the program is to pro-
mote understanding and above all cooperation be-
tween students andsecurity police. The large num-
ber of robberies and assaults on campus are ex-
tremely difficult to_ solve when students refuse to
cooperate in identification of suspects, will not
press charges where criminals are apprehended, or
feel that the problem is not theirs unless it happens

NOT TO BUST

If the student can adopt the belief that the cam-
pus security officer is not out to “bust heads," al-
though uniformed and armed, but is here for the
mutual interests of the University community, and
the security officer can clarify his preceptions of
the student as an individual and not a symbol, then
perhaps some semblance of understanding can be
achieved and genuine cooperation in the University
community can begin.

prises nearly one-third of the
total enrollment.

Pitt News Special

Pot May Be Harmful

(Editor's Note: The following story is a reprint from the College Press
Service which has been released to The Pitt News.)

WASHINGTON—CPS—The next load of marijuana from the mid-
west may contain a pesticide which a government commission recom-
mended “should be immediately restricted to prevent risk of human ex-
posure" because it is possible the pesticide causes birth defects.

Under a joint effort of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous
Drugs and the Extension Service of the Agricultural Department, farm-
ers throughout the midwest are being urged by County Agents to spray
the pesticide 1, 4-D on wild marijuana crops. A major effort is under-
way in 20 counties and ten midwestern states but the effort is nation-
wide according to George Gaffney, project officer for the attempt to
destroy marijuana.

Although no research has been done on the effects of 2, 4-D when
smoked, research on the pesticide when ingested has given evidence
that birth defects may be found, and the Secretary of HEW Robert
Finch has stated that the use of the pesticide should be “immediately
restircted to prevent risk of human exposure."

It is possible, however, that 2, 4-D may be even more dangerous
when smoked, according to Dr. Joseph NcLaughlin, a researcher for
the Food and Drug Administration.

Midwest marijuana has long had a reputation of being very mild,
and not very good for getting high. Some dealers have mixed domestic
grass with the Mexican variety, selling it as Mexican. It is thus possi-
ble that some people who think they are buying imported ‘dope could
really be getting marijuana which has been sprayed with 2, 4-D.

It should be emphasized that there is no proof 2, 4-D will cause
birth defects, when ingested or smoked, and that the birth defects found
in lab animals were caused by doses far larger than any marijuana user
is likely to consume.

Pitt News Drama Critic

by ARTHUR ROSENBERG
Drama Critic
The Studio Theatre‘s produc-
tion of Jean Genet‘s The Maids
will be revived on Sept. 25. 26.

’ and Oct. 2 and 3 at the little the-

atre on the ground floor of the
Cathedral of Learning. Presented
last spring. Maids was an instan-
taneous success with capacity au-
diences. The quality of this pro-
duction alone, as presented at that
time. justifies its revival for stu-
dents and staff alike. A superb
cast headed by Valerie Ososky
and Francine Nemitz will return
for this production.

There‘s a lot to be said for the
production of The Maids by the
Studio Theatre. Not only is this
one of the finer products of its
period in French theatre. but as a
University presentation. it is cur-
iously superior to any previous
productions of this year. save R
and G Are Dead presented last
winter.

To delve into French theatre.

.its history as a transformation

would lend an understanding to
Maids, adding perspective to a
playwright of considerable note
and force in the French drama.

There seems to be little doubt
that the influence of Becket, Ion-
esco, and Genet is more wide-
spread than the impact of those
affirmative playwrights before
them. Grouped together under
“The Theatre of the Absurd” (a

category they did not choose),
they are a minority of dramatists
even as they have major signifi-
cance. The most influential work
of the three was Beckett’s Wait-
ing for Godot.

Probably the most obscene. im-
passioned, and vividly theatrical
of all of these dramatists is Jean
Genet. He appears as the messen-
ger of evil—exceedingly colorful
with a violence and ambiguity
above many other contemporary
playwrights.

The theatre of the absurd is a
pessimistic theatre. often em-
ploying farce as a device. Parti-
cularly in many of Ionescos‘
works. we see it as tradgedy with
a grin. Such plays are more often
than not better received in univer-
sity theatres or off-Broadway by
American audiences, most parti-
cularly because they are non-real-
istic.

Satre spoke for most French
dramatists when he said, “I am
for the real and against realism.”
Characters in French plays are
usually conceptual images rather
than what we call real flesh and
blood personage. To make its
points French drama uses para-
dox, irony, and metaphor. It is a
drama of language, taking often
to the wildest expressions—to the
point of madness while American
theatre has traditionally sought
safer, more respectable identity.

To Come

Maids delves into the human di-
lemma of man’s class and caste;
of a wastebasket of human emo-
tion; of tears of longing; of im-
perfections which are sealed shut
by; and are products of the sys-
tem. Exploding with a freedom
when struck by diaster, it brings
death to the evils of the world-
by death or martrydom. There is
little salvation, little hope to heal
the perils that life presents. The
here and now is left to the dreams
of never to be . . . a circular story
of the repeating sequence of life‘s
unconquerable fate.

Richard J akiel has done a splen-
did job—far superior. to Names
which he directed last winter. My
only real criticism of note deals
with the second half of the play.
Although “slow pacing" is use-
ful as a' transitional device here.
in a few instances things dragged
a bit.

Francine Nemitz was impres-

sive and delightfully beable. Her
variation was quite good, deliv-
ery consistenly sensitive with a
total performance that left me
with the feeling of a skilled and
talented young performer.

Valerie Ososky shows a great
deal of promise. Although not ful-
ly matured—she displayed some
fine moments (especially in the
latter half of the play) but her
character wallowed a bit here and
there. Henry Heyman‘s set was
well done and quite attractive.
Sherry Caldwells technical skill
(better than her last effort) cre-
ated a purposeful and effective
lighting design for this production.

The development of any the-
atre program is seen by the pro-
ducts produced. Curiously, a very
superior show has been mounted
exceedinly well. Pe_rhaps there
may be consistency in this area
also.

Associate Sports Editor

The Panther football squad
(7-point underdogs) is ready
to go. tentatively.

Head Coach Carl DePasqua

has chosen Saturdays starters for
the UCLA clash. Yet. one of the
biggest questions puzzling fans
still hasn't been resolved. As of
now. either Dave Havern or
John Hogan could open against
the Bruins.

DePasqua mentioned leader-
ship and the ability to perform
under pressure as characteristics
that he is searching for in a

quarterback. He also indicated
that both passers will probably
be exposed to the UCLAN de-
fense. '

Pitt’s ‘publicity department
recently released a TE NTA-
TIVE starting lineup. Dave

Havern (in a guess) was listed
as quarterback. Others were:
Tony Esposito-fullback, Denny
Ferris-running back, Doug Gin-
den-flankerbck, Steve Moyer
split end, Joel Klimek-tight end,
Bill Beinecke-tackle, Bruce Har-
kiewicz-tackle, Dan Lynn-guard,
John Simpson-guard, and Bob
Kuziel-center.

ning.”

He mentioned that Oregon
State tried to pressure Dum-
mit. The Panthers. meanwhile.
will attempt the identical
task.

"'We’ll definitely have to put
a great deal of pressure on him
in order to contain their attack."
Quinter explained.

Despite Oregon State’s in-
tense defense, Dummit com-
pleted 18 or 29 passes. How-

ever, his‘ 170 total yards pass-
ing indicates that he was forced
to toss mostly short passes. The
Bruin rushing helped to deflate
Oregon State even more than
did the passing. UCLA out-
gained OSU 302 to 139 on the
ground.

"Halfback Arthur Sims does
-a good job of filling-in for Mick-
ey Cureton. and so does his
replacement. Randy Tyler. This

gives them a very balanced
attack." Quinter remarked.. ‘
DePasqua added. "UCLA's

running will make their pass-
ing even more effective."

Quinter further noted A that
the Bruins lack the streaking

speed of past years, although_

they compensate for the slight
imperfection with amazing
quickness. .

The offensive performers. how-
ever. don't possess a monopoly
on team quickness. "UCLA has
a tall and rangy defense that has
excellent quickness.“ Quinter
said. "Overall. I ,would say
that it should be a very close
ball game." i

f  Greg Rodgers Begins  
 Final Year Of Running

»

by MARTY HELLMAN

"I was too small to play football and I wasn't good at soccer. so I
decided to run cross country with my brother in high school." rem-
inisced Greg Rodgers about his start in cross country.

' Since that decision to become a runner was made in his sophomore
year at Lancaster High School. Greg has excelled as a cross country
and track star. V -

"I like cross countrybecause "it is a great conditioning sport. al-
though I cansconsider myself great in it." remarked Rodgers.

Unlike most cross country runners, Rodgers likes a hilly course.
“I seem to run better on a hill,” mentioned the.‘senior harrier. ‘‘In fact.
I seem to do better in‘ a race
where there are a lot of hills."

In Greg’s first year at Pitt, he
was number two man on the
freshman squad behind Richey.
Since then, he has been in the top —   
five on the varsity. , .  . 

Rodgers had an encounter with
three of his present teammates
in high school. In the Pennsyl-
vania State Cross Country Cham-
pionship of 1966. Greg copped
sixth place. while Jerry Richey
and Mike Schurko ran 1-i and
Mike Nolan edged him for fifth
position.

to that outcome.

Is his team anything like last
year’s 8-1-1 squad and does it
have the same possibilities?

“It isn’t the same team,” he
answered, with his drawl that
makes it sound as if he’s in a
cozy place like your living
room or the back room at Gus-
tine’s.

Same possibilities?

“No, it doesn't.”

Prothro was also asked to com-
pare Pitt to Oregon State.

RIFLE TEAM
NEEDS -CIIOOTIRS

All eligible varsity riflemen and
anyone interested in coming out
for the team should come to the
team’s second meeting Friday

He couldn’t handle the task,
he said-“I haven’t seen this
year’s Pitt team. ”

Prothro wasn’t finished with
the down to earth answers.

Someone asked if Oregon State
was a good football team.

“I don’t know,” Prothro gave
the by-then expected answer.

 {“All they’ve played is us. And

I don’t know how good we are?”

luncheons have been switched to
the Babcock Room to bring them
to a campus locale, away from
distractions. More calls like the
one to Prothro and the fancy room
at the top of the Cathedral may
begin to seem like the cozy
back room at Gustine’s.

Nest week the luncheon’s will
be held at Gustine’s for the
final time. Because of a previous
committment the Babcock Room
won’t be available. The next
week, however, the luncheons
return to the room for the re-
mainder of the season.

For the first time in one year

male guest—but the gathering
didn’t seem to be affected.
Former Sports Editor of the Pitt
News Martha Hartle is now
attending Yale Law School and
wasn’t present. Unlike the ex-
pectations presumed because of
a few comments by a writer last
year, there was no additional
swearing. Maybe it was the at-
mosphere of the Babcock Room?

Tsima. a South African transfer student, has been playing soccer

since he was four years old. In ad-
dition to soccer, he has played on
championship tennis and cricket
teams, both in South Africa and
internationally.

Lekoma was the team’s high
scorer in his first year at Pitt. He
scored the team’s only goals in

Yogi Days
Are Near

Like a big brass band, the 1970
crop of yogis will march into the
columns of the Pitt News sports
section this week and every week,
sprewing out their supreme wis-
dom in vivid predictions about the
results of the most controversial
weekly football games.

Defending champion from the
1969 core of pea pickers is Wee
Willie, the one and only “Buzz"
Nabb in disguise. Seeking revenge
for his second place finish is the
infamous “Quack.” Taking over
the vacated crystal ball positions
will be Marty “Zelmo” Hellman,
Don “Chief” Marbury, Mike “Cu-
tie” Miller, Jerry “Nubs” Myers
and a surprise female guest.

The players and the coaches
aren’t picking this year due to a
minor that has been spread that
they are going to win. The players
nosed out the coaches last year
matching their 71-43 record _
with the coaches’ tally of 69-45.

When asked what the secret of
his success is, Wee Willie said,
“buzz of willya.”‘Next we turned
to Ed Conley but all we got out of
him was “quack, quack, quack,
quack, quack.”

tributes his scoring mainly to the
combined efforts of the entire
squad.

“I am supported by these guys,”
he says, “If my scoring is high it
is because of them. If it is low it is
because of them also.”

Lekoma believes in leaving the
strategy formation to the coach.

“I am a player, I'm his tool. It
depends on him, not on us,” he
said. ‘‘I concentrate on the game
and how I play.”

After missing a year of play due
to scheduling problems and ill-
ness, Tsima returns to what he
feels is an improved team.

“We have a better team this
year," states Lekoma. “We have
better skilled younger players and
high school recruits coming up.“

Today's match against CMU

played competitively for three

‘ years and was a member of the

South Park tennis team this
summer. She rates as a steady
player who is noted for “blow-
ing her opponent’s cool."

Teaching tennis this summer
in Shaler Township and playing
in many local tournaments kept
Elaine Kingas in practice. She
is a forceful player, who prefers
to play at the net.

Joann Kotjan, a power player,
likes to hit the ball hard and
putit away.

The efforts of these girls and
the new players potential should
produce a successful season.

“With nine matches and prac-

ready have a feather in our

often and that will help im-

Girls’ Hockey Faces
Long, Tough Season

Deidre Burnstine‘s field hockey team played only two games
last season but defeated both opponents. CMU and Chatham. This
year with eight games scheduled, a new playing field—-the men’s

Miss Burnstine, who has coach-
ted the team for the two years
she's been at Pitt, began playing
field hockey in seventh grade.

Field hockey, a combination
of soccer and ice hockey, isn’t
as popular here as on the eastern

been difficult recruiting players.

However, the coach’s outlook
for the upcoming season is bright.
“We have some good players

tennis camp this fall in Maine.

The match begins at 4:00 at
