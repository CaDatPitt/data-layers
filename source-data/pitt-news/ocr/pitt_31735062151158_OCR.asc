_  Introduction Stating’
Purpose of Survey. '

c

 

A survey of the negro migration to
Pittsburgh, made by A-braham. Ep-
stein, Economics '17, and supervised
by Dr. Francis Tyson, has just been
“completed for ‘publication. The sur-
vey was started last year by the mem-
bers of ‘the Social Science» Club, when
the “first -large migration of negro
labor came to this district. 3

The work was -merely started last
year, and after the graduation_ of Mr.
Epstein he was asked to continue the
survey. Intensive work on the sur-
vey was begun las-t June when a_ study
of ﬁve hundred individual cases was
made with the use of schedule forms,
which sought information as to living
conditions,’ wages," family conditions
and other problems vital to the negro
laborer. A study wastalso made of
the police court records for the past
three years, child de1‘inquency, l.abor
unions, and employment. i

All these facts. have -been gathered
together in this survey, the purpose
‘being as has "been stated -by Professor
Tyson in the introduction “_to show
the need for the correct treatment of
the negro laborer and to‘show the de-
plorable conditions in this city.so that
they may be an example to other
cities which have a similar problem."

The greatest pa‘ of -the work was
done by Mr. Epstein in "securing the
data and in investigating the actual
conditions. Mr. Epstein when a stu-
dent at the University was active in
social work and made a study of social
problems during his career as a stu-
dent. ' - 1 '

The publications will soon be re-
leased and distributed to those who
desire to secure them. A

The possibilities are that it will be
taken over as a University publication.
'-as a ‘study of the Sohool of Eco-
nomics. “ r

 McClelland. Captain Carlson _has proven l1imselfAAa~
 leaderand a great deal of our suc-cessthis year can
_ tracedto his individual efforts.’ Pitt did not have_the,great-

' est team that everAA represented this institution but we are sure
VA-that‘ no captain ever had a moredifﬁcult ta.sk. Carlson led a
team that was shattered by'- graduation and almost: Atotally, dc-’
stAroyed'"by_enl~'1st~ments. He did not hesitate in his task Abut with
f3AAI‘11e,Pftt-Alspirit he inspired his "men on and when ‘the whistle
 ending the game last Saturday he had led his men to the
un_ﬂi‘sputed»championship of the East and in the minds of many

the chanipions of" the country. . V
 .AndA'asWe glance sorrowfully over the list of those men who
have represented Pitt for the last time we hesitate over the natnes
of.A-Southerland an,d"Seidel. -These men formed the bu-lwarks of
our defense. 1 Ever reliable they unsparingly gave every _Aounce.Aof

THREE YEARS UNGONQUEREID 

,_ Once again the Pitt Panther retires to its lair 11I1co»nq1ieI;ed.
,]§_‘orjthe third successive year, Coach Warner has led his charges
through; an unbroken string o-frvictories. Our joy is complete.
-Never did a coa«ch,.,fac.e more perplexing problems. Before the

__A"Avery ﬁrst game was played, VVarner lost Aschman, who was
 slated to play in the backﬁeld and then the day before the Penn

game Hilty ,was called to the colors. Each time, however,

A~Warner rose to the occasion and in each game ‘Warner-was de-

,—clared the victor. D

A Only one game was lost on the gridiron during the past four
years. ‘ Four years ago ‘V. &.J_., with the greatest team that ever
Iffepresented that institution, forced the Panther to how its head

_.in defeat 13 to 10. In realitythat defeat was a_ victory, for

f  & J. was heralded to trample over our goal line at least a half
 ‘dozen times. In 1915, guided by “Chalky” Williamson, Pitt’s

.gla-diators decisively whipped all comers and fought their way
"f to the very pinnacle of supremacy, only to- ﬁnd the place sought
hy Cornell,,who boasted of a. similar record. Last year in 1916,

 hour victory wascomplete. Noteam dared dispute our supremacy-

and wojworé ackno-wlediged the champions -of the football uni-

“I believe this,to be the most feasible
way_of giving the University of Pitts-

the;life of the insured, but at his death,

Ias the amount insured for is turned

allowed his insurance to lapse for a
good and sufficient reason. This speaks
well of class spirit and loyalty to their
A1maiMater. and I trust we will be able
to boast of Pitt students and Pitt Alumni
in a like manner towards their Alma
Mater." ‘

Mr. Woods also spoke on the great
progress of the University in the past”

greater progress in the near future,
as the ever increasing importance. of
Pittsburgh as a ‘manufacturing and
business center demands an ‘institu-
tion of learning second to none in the
country. -'
i A Chance for All.

In concluding his remarks Mr.

Woods said:

i"I believe we are all indebted _to Mr.
St. Peter for giving us the opportunity
to participate in this most worthy cause
—the members of the Alumni and stu-
dent body, the opportunity to repay
their Alma Mater not only for their
education—in a professional or educa-
tional Way, but for the character and
ideals which are instilled and constitute
a part-of this education;——ever busi-
ness man, the opportunity to par cipate
in this advancement of civic pride ’in,
our community and insurance men .to
demonstrate their ability to take part
in this far-reaching plan of insurance
which will not only beneﬁt the Univer-
sity, but also serve as 0. shining exam-
ple as one of the many practicable uses
to which life insurance can be put."

Mr. Jaiiies M. Dalbey, local repre-’
sentative of theoM_utua1 Life Insur-
ance Conipany, also addressed the
meeting, and stated that in most cases,
where ainan was showii that it was.
not only a question of loyalty and
gratitude to his.Alma Mater, but also
a matter qf pride in beinguassociated
l-with an institution such. as Pitt will
-be, he invariably subscribed if his cir-
cumstances permitted him to do so.

In speaking to the Secretary the
other day regarding the Insurance En-
dowment Funrl, one of the prominent
alumni of the U1llV€r$l‘ly who is an
expert in life insurance matters, said:

f‘You naturally want to understand,
and to be able to tell others, what this
ericlowmeiit plan means, not only for the
farther future, but for these pressing,
present war years. ‘

A_ War Need.

“The University is a. WAR NEED,
one of the most vital. For this is a war
of science and mind——of engineers.

are the leaders in opening the Opportu-

«Among all the war needs pressing
for cash today, none is more vital, none
more modest in the sums asked, none
more certain to make such sums go far.
And this one rests directly upon us who
are Pitt’s Alumni or friends.”
