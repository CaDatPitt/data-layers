Textbooks

The Student Government Book
Exchange has issued a plea to stu-
dentsifor more used text books,
particularly those needed for
freshman courses.

The exchange sold more than
250, books in two days and would
have sold many .more, according
to Jay Fingaret, chairman of the

Book Exchange, if they had had V

enjough copies of the popular
texts.

They are especially seeking
books for Biology 11 (previously
1);'Math-. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23; and 24;
History 11 and 12 (previously 1
and ; History 40 and 41 (previ-
ously 71 and 7; and Anthropology
80 (previously 1 and 100).

Fingaret also said that al-
though in August the exchange
accepted all books which stu-
dents offered, some of these
boks were not placed on sale.
They were not placed on sale
because some books are no
longer required for fall courses.

Book Exchange personnel con-
sulted lists of books required for
each course, obtained through co-
operation with the Book Center,
and eliminated those texts which
students would not be interested
in buying.

Because of this screening pro-
cess, the exchange will be able to
waive the customary 10 cent
handling charge on books which
are not being used. Persons who
are attempting to sell books which
are required this fall, however,
must pay the handling fee whether
their books are purchased or not.

The exchange will remain open
for the remainder of this week
and will return unsold texts and
the money for purchased texts
next Monday and Tuesday.

‘Big Brother’ Program 
Meets Some Setbacks

Forgetful freshmen and confused contractors combin-
ed to put a few hitches in Men's Council’s Big Brother Pro-
gram but the “big brothers” managed to carry out their
agenda anyway.

The original plan, as formulated by Men’s Council last
spring, called for each big brother to be assigned eight

freshmen. ‘He was to send each of them two letters-—one
Welcoming him and the other giv-9
ing him the details of the time
and place they would meet.

Because of late freshman ap-
plicants and those students who
indicated that they would be
counselors and then dropped out,
however_, there were difficulties.

Since no masterlist of fresh-
men and counselors existed,
the reassignments were made
mostly by calculated guesswork.
This reassigning resulted in
disparate groups ranging from
ﬁfteen. men per big brother in-
stead of the planned number,
eight.

The brothers were to meet in
Langley -Hall, but when the com-
mittee in charge arrived they
found contractors installing’ tile
floors in the new rooms. Despite
these difficulties, the big brothers
met with their groups, discussed
general problems with them, an-
swered questions, and attempted
to instruct them in “the ways of
registering.”

Joe Beeler, an Arts freshman,
said, “the program was a very
great help to me. Through it I
learned things which, although
gone over and restated in meet-
ings with others, were more

upperclass counselor.”

Dorm Students Up 1400% In 5 Years

responsibilities . over‘ ‘his
former position as Schenley Hall
Supervisor.

Both men will meet periodically
with Dr. Geise for the formation
of ‘Student Union policies. Dr.
Geise said that “students can’ look
forward to a continuation and
growth of the present Union
program.”

The two co-directors fill the
vacancy left by William mi.
Cooper. last year‘s SU director,
who resigned for a position at
Trenton State College in New
Jersey.

Heller has been with the Stu‘— 1 .

dent Union since it began to oc-
cupy its present building. He
graduated from the University in
1958 and joined the administrative
staff under Dr. Swartzbaugh, then

head of the Union. .-

Bigger has devoted much of his
life to country-club and hotel
management. He joined the Uni-
versity three years ago as Schen-
ley Hall supervisor. In addition to
his responsibilities for the entire
Schenley Hall physical plant, res-
ervations are now also completely
under his direction. This function
was formerly under the SU di-
rector.

Bigger is now a joint member
of the Student Affairs and Busi-

ness Affairs staffs.

Construction on the University's
new three-tower dormitory oilfi-
cially started last Thursday when
Chancellor Litchﬁeld, Gwilym
Price, chairman of the Board of
Trustees, and Thomas O. Mere-
dith, of the F.H.A. turned the earth
in groundbreaking ceremonies
next to the Schenley Quadrangle.

Before’ a crowd of 150 Univer-
sity administrators, faculty and
students, Meredith designated the
groundbreaking as symbolic of the
dynamic movement in the Univer-
sity in the past few years.

As the Chancellor pointed out
ﬁve Years ago, the University
housed 100 dorm students. Today
over 1500 students are living on
campus.

The new dormitory ae.
signed by Deeter and Ritchey,
are expected to house 1868 men
alone. It should be completed
by the fall of 1963.

The three-towered building,

originally slated for completion in

 Impression Battle
The annual battle of impressions took over the campus
last week as 1125 enthusiastic freshmen clashed with twice
as many doting university officials and upperclassmen.
Although this year's group fell 475 short of the expect-
ed 1600, the class made up in quality what it lacked in
quantity. According to ﬁgures released from the office of
student admissions, 56 percent of the entering freshmen
were in the top ﬁfth of their graduating class, quite an up-
swing from previous years. In addition, eleven freshmen

had skipped their senior year in high school.

Traditional university honor and pride directed the
lmovements of administrators, faculty and students as they
matched this.attack with an impressive record of their own.
A‘ well planned week of assemblies, tests, outings, recep-
tions anddances introduced the newcomers to a rapid pace

of college life.

yNow»the slow process of disillusionment will set in.
With two days of the year gone, much of the awe remains,

' but adjustments have begun. The long year of work and
_ study is underway. And as in past years both sides will be-
-come disappointed as the dropouts start and “snap” courses

mount.

Hopefully, this year’s class will prove an exception as
they move into an exceptional program. For the past three
years the excuse for the letdown has been “transition,” “re-‘
organization” or, more impressive, “dynamic change.” This
third class to enter un.der the trimester system must change

such a notion. '

The addition of ﬁve Mellon Professors and 200 new fac-
ulty members can hardly be offered as an excuse for failure.
Neither can advanced freshman classes in English, math

‘and languages be apologized for. The academic challenge
is growing at Pitt each year for students who are wi.lling
to place the Greeks, football games and studies in their

proper perspective.

While meeting the basic needs of the academic scholar,

To Hell And Back’. . 5

Welcome to Bedlam

By Moﬁhow Nesvisky

When General William Tecumseh Sherman
tiredly summarized his opinion of war in that brief,
oft-quoted observation,‘ he probably believed it
wholeheartedly. But if he had had the jmisfortune
to be in the Commons Room at the end of last
week, he would have joyously
galloped back to the battle-ﬁeld
for thecomparable order, peace
and solitude of its mass mur-
derings. . , ‘

Registration was -indeed, hell. i
Perhaps it was not as bad “as it
used to be,“ as withered alumni
relate from «their wheelchairs,
but this is little consolation to
we who lost our arches in those
endless lines last Friday. ‘ ' «

If one had pre-registered
early, in February for instance, the ordeal would

possibly have been reduced. But if, like most of
us, a student happened to need a schedule change,

or for some reason or other had to register at the
last minute, or (God forbid) he happened to be
an Incoming Freshman, then brother, it was “Mur-
der -in the Cathedral.” ‘

First off, the University had obviously not
deemed it necessary to supply the students with
accessible sources of information. The only peo-
ple in the building who could possibly know what
the devil was going on were all located behind
desks, which in turn were all preceded by mon-
strous queues of puzzled students.

It.~has been reported that one Freshman stood
in line for over three hours, merely to find out
where the men’s room was located. He later indi-
cated that he no longer cared about reaching this
destination.

Mingle. Mingle

Secondly, class cards were distributed poorly,
to say the least. The cards for the entire catalogue
of courses were unequally divided and placed on
six. conterminus desks. The streams of students

' behind them helplessly intermingled, which meant,

of course, that one "did not necessarily arrive’ at
the desk which he had intended to visit. But even
if one did, there was no assurance that his desired
class had not been closed hours before. A

Then there was the stomach—juggling business
of changing a schedule. In order to perform this
thirteenth labor" of Hercules, the hopeful student
first had to acquire authorization. This’ meant

standing in line to. see the authorizors, of ‘course. ,

And when he did reach this Nirvana, he was
usually informed that in order to have a schedule
altered, he must present documents to verify the
necessity of the request. If the student did not
have such a note, he generally had no alternative
other than trying to crash the iron registration
gate next winter. A
Hungry CI-utchers

Occasionally, some students were granted their
wish. Hungrily clutching their authorizations, they
could be seen crawling towards the Commons
Room, praying that their ﬁngers would not be
trampled.

So then let us all close our eyes very tightly
and pretend that a student does actually manage

   

needless turmoil.

to obtain his schedule change. After waiting in

another line until he is too tired to collapse, the .l

somehow receives his class card. But along with

it _are almost a dozen identical cards that all re-
quire him to explain the change he has made.

But it surely keeps the IBM people happy.
And when this ravished child clings pantingly
at the cashier’s window, his money is taken with

lightning speed. That part went disturbingly -fast,
indeed. ~ . .

At any rate, when this illustration is multi-
plied by the number of milling students who were A
present at registration, one can almost compre-
hend the immensity of the whole chaotic affair. It

‘is felt that getting an appointment with Khrushchev

would be easier than obtaining class cards on
registration day at our University. ‘
End Inquisition ' . _

Naturally, the question of reducing the toil in
registration arises. Pre-registration was a worthy
plan, but it ‘is not enough,‘ to be sure. There are,
I believe, several other possibilities for easing the
anguish of our pre-term inquisition: ’

First and most important, registration should
not be compressed into the mere day and a‘ half
which we experienced. It must be recognized that
we have a large school here. Spreading out regis-
tration over a ) week, for instance, ‘ would be less.
irritating to students and administrators’ alike.
The inﬁnite queues, and particularly those for
schedule changes, would no longer exist.

Secondly, the practice of standing in line to
obtain class cards and then ﬁnding out that the
class is closed should be abolished. The Univer-
sity should devise some method of constantly in-
forming the students on ﬁlled classes. This could
be done with a large bulletin board, or perhaps
with a loudspeaker. \

V Desk Mess

In addition, there seems to be no excuse for
dispensing class cards in only six lines. One line
included all ‘ the courses from Psychology to
Zoology. A glance at a catalogue shows the
frightening amount of courses in between. So why
not twelve desks? Or ﬁfteen?

But the agony of the chaotic registration was

not entirely the fault of the University people. A

The “children” of our student body must not be
overlooked. These are the Pitdiots who push,
shove, sneak into the heads of lines and wallow
about making single ﬁle lines double, triple and
quadruple. _ ‘ l

And the girls are not free from blame. They
were in there, shoving away like varsity lineback-
ers. It has been rumored that several carried bricks
in their purses. At least it seemed that way. ,
i All of this added weight to the yokes on the
shoulders of the people who distributed class cards
and had to do spur-of-the-momentadvising. The
men and women who were employed by the Uni-
versity to instruct and found themselves handling
registration deserve our pity.

Concluding, it can be seen that registration is
still a hellish business, both for students and ad-
ministrators and that the cooperation and thought-
fulness of both are needed for eliminating its

' an

on the other hand, university administrators cannot be-
come smug in their position. Surprise Saturday classes,
sudden course cancellations and tuition raises will never
be accepted as a matter of course. As long as this univer-
sity strives for academic freedom, there will be strife be--
tween students and officials as to the method of achieving
that end. » A

side isslated forsuccess. Now it’s the old story of work-
ing together, of cherishing those first impressions and ma-

The friendly competitioniandi ‘

enthusiasm aroused by upperclass
counselors at Freshmen Camp
Twin Echo this year helped to
unite the class of. 1965 men. In
center above is Charlie Lucas, an
upperclass leader, who was found
to have that certain talent for
urging his ‘Gold.’ team to victor

Even a leg injury did‘ not damp-
en his spirit — and his ‘boys’
won the cup. The friendly, com-
petitive canoe race resulted in
a mass swimmingspree.

weight of his burden by 585 and’
realize that the floors of Schenley
must sag beneath the weight, of
so many clothes, records, nick-
nacks, and books (‘?). Freshmen,
however. were not the biggest of—
fenders. It seemed that the up-
perclassmen were the ones who
arrived with everything but the‘
proverbial kitchen sink.

  Fatigue F eshmen
  Fall Fromw Festivities

The freshmen were led from’
registration lines to teas, assem-A
hlies, outings, tests, and dances:
during their Week of orientation
The pace that was set for them
became tiring and one by one
they collapsed ~——— in lounges, dorm
rooms, and on busses and street-
cars headed for home. _

But unsuspected is the fact the
the feeling of unity that they
worked all week to achieve must"
once again be earned when the
unfamiliar upperclassmen‘ arrive
oncampus.

The. climax to their.week was‘
a day of fun at Kiski. A dull quiet
reigned" over the campus as the so_
obviously enthusiastic class of
1965 cheered‘ for Pitt at Kiski.
Swimming, volley ball, and soft-
ball were a few of the activities
they enjoyed before the refresh-
ing rain sent them all scurrying
(for cover.

N0 mere atmospheric H20, how-
ever, could dampen their spirits;
‘their returning cheers were some~l
what softer but suffered from no
lac}; of enthusiasm.

With   Freshman Spirit  

New Quarterback Paul Martha Stings Ears;

Mike Ditka’s Bullying

Absent This Campaign

By JIM 0’BRIEN
Sports Editor

Team spirit is an intangibility which is usually discounted
by cynics. “What team doesn’t have it?” the skeptical ob-
server will observe. Last year Pitt’s football ‘team lost only
three games without spirit. This may prove the insigniﬁcance

‘of spirit.

In the same vein, the 1960 eleven won only four games.

Perhaps they could have won?

seven engagements. with
i.e., the non-alcoholic type-
Last year there was dissension
among the senior members.
Cliques were numerous and any
esprit de corps was monopolized
by the undefeated yearlings.
Captain Bullies Mates
Mike Ditka, a bona ﬁde All-
American if there ever was one,

spirit,

ywas also somewhat of a bully.
Ditka put out 100 per cent every

game, and expected likewise from
his contemporaries. He was apt
to rough up any dissenters a bit.

Some team members, espe-
cially the seniors, resented the
constant tongue-lashing, ’ just as
some of the Pittsburgh Steelers
resent the lava-tongue of Quar-
terback Bobby Layne. They re-
belled. It was eleven individ-
uals last year. It is a team this
time.

College freshmen are always
portrayed as eager, fresh-scrubbed
status-seekers. Last year’s plebes
are just that, only they have ma-
tured in a year, and are now
seeking jobs on the first-string.
So far only Rick Leeson has
breached the all-veteran lineup,
but more are anxious to leap over
seniority barriers.

Fast Newcomers

As 5 result everyone is
struggling to gain recognition,
even letter-men are in a precari-
ous position. These newcomers
are fast, a virtue which no one
has ever accused the Pitt back-
ﬁeld of being in the last decade.

The team as a unit looks "ﬁt

and able to cope with the
schedule which resembles a
mine ﬁeld. But the quarterback
spot is the hub about whicha
team’s success revolves, and the
heir to the now-injured Jim
’l‘raﬁcant’s job must be a top-
notch man. —

Paul Martha, the dandy that
sparked the freshmen to their fine
season last year, looks like the
most logical choice. He is the

prep school’s answer to the Steel- 4

ers’ Layne.
Newcomer Has Appeal

He is a glamour boy whose
every movement on the ﬁeld is
accompanied by “oohs” and “ahs”
from the gallery, especially from.
the feminine gentry.

This same appeal, plus his out-
spoken manner, e.g., “that ‘D’ unit
is real garbage” has not kindled
any ﬁery love for him in the
hearts of his teammates. They ad-
dress him as “Sweetie” and
“Everybody’s All-American Boy.”
He may be one day.

HUSKY FULLBACKS are aplenty on the 1961 Pitt Football roster

Two Newcomers
Cause of Outlook

Coach Leo Bemis was ver-
bally kicking the subject of
soccer around Kinnard Field

in Terrace Village the other‘

day as his recruits ﬁled in for
duty. The lantern - j a w e d
coach was surveying the Village
landscape which was enhanced by
the presence of a bumper crop of
soccer players. ’

All present had gone through
a rigorous physical examination
on Tuesday and now Bemis was
anxious to see how good the boys
could “ed de ball and boot de
bloody ‘t’ing,” as “Doc” Carlson
puts it.

Unlike his football contem-
poraries whose bleak outlooks ﬁll
the” newspapers from December to
September, Bemis is optimistic
about the upcoming grind.

, Defensive Losses Hurt
« .“I think that we’re going to be
allright,” Bemis remarked. “Sure
we lost a lot or nne boys, espec-
ially on the defensive side, but we
have a lot of seasoned players re-
turning, too, along with some
really good newcomers.”

One or the latter, who still re-
mains a. question mark as far as
permission to compete is con-
cerned, is the reason for Bemis’
optimism. Oddly enough, it is a
Pitt football player.

Ray Tarasi, a speedy ball-car-
rier for John Michelosen the last
two seasons, is also an outstand-
ing halfback on the longer soccer
field. Tarasi suffered a broken arm
in the West Virginia game last
year and his doctor has ruled out
any further football playing.

Tarasi Holds Key

He may, however, be permitted
to play soccer. Having already
starred for a local top-flight ama-
teur team, the Harmarville Hurri-

Not “Edding de ball”

canes, he will add punch to the
Panther ‘oﬁensive line.

Pete Smith. a diminutive
Irishman‘ who made the Penn-
sylvania-New Jersey All-Star
squad, carries an adroit toe,
honed for quick scoring. Bob
Cuthbert, who had to sit out the
past baseball season with a sore‘
knee, is the other front liner.

The availability of Tarasi would
allow Bemis to shift Paul Liberati,
aforward in 1960, to a halfback
position. This pair would provide
the Cats with an offensive threat

on the past team.
Veterans Return

Returning on the defensive unit
are ﬁve letter—men, including
goalie George Georgakokis. “I ex-
pect him to come through for me
this year,” Bemis confided. The
other returnees are Chuck Dun-
bar, Steve Daniels, Jerry Yospin,
and Ronald: Mehocks.
