A. W. S.

By BERNI McLEOD

“Consolidation for bigger
and better things” marks
the philosophy behind a new
Associate-d Women Students
Handbook, now in the plan-

‘ ning stage, which will take

the place of the Pitt Co-ed, the
Panh-el Handbook, the AWS Hand-
book, and the AWS Flipper. ‘

The Handbook, proposed at a
recent AWS Council meeting will
serve as an over-all reference

manual for University. women. It .

will include, among other things,
sorority information, regulations
on dress, dormito-ry rules, social
customs, and University tradi-
tions.

With the approval of Dean of
Women‘ Savina S. Skewis, a
search for an editor-in-chief for
the Handbook is. now underway.
The student will be responsible
for consolidating the information
from the other past publications,
directing the lay-out of the pages,
and including up-to-date informa-
tion on all University positions
a.nd regulations.

According to Kay Shenesky,
AWS president, studentsmay ap-
ply for job as editor starting to-
morrow by picking up an applica-
tion blank in the Dean of Wom-

en’s office, 1209 CL. A]
cations must be turned in by Fri-
day, Sept. 30, and the editor will
be announced shortly thereafter.
“The new AWS Handbook will
be a big improvement over hav-
ing four separate publications,”
said Miss Shenesky, “When wom-
en students pick up their copy
next September, they will have a
convenient reference guide for
answering any question they may
have about the University.”
The booklets that the new
Handbook will incorporate pre-
viously had very different func-
tions. The Pitt Co-ed was given
out to freshman women during

- summer Orientation and includ-

ing information on dress and tra-
ditlons. The “ﬂipper” contained
dormitory rules; the AWS Hand-
book handled University customs,
and the Panhel Handbook dealt
with sororities and rush.

Pitt Hosts Convention

Mortar Board, national wom-
en’s leadership honorary, will
host a sectional convention Fri-
day and Saturday, with the co-
operation of the Dean of Wom-
en’s office.

Student Government

Begins Its

Student Government has begun
its year of activities with the
completion of the Book Exchange
and the collection of information
cards for the Student Directory.

According to Bernie Koch,
chairman of the Book Exchange,
the total sales were o-ver $1,700.
The Book Exchange ran from
Sept. 7 to 16 and was manned

this year entirely by volunteers."

Koch commended the work of
committee members Cyndie Cor-
bett; Kathy Baierl, Carol Steiner
and Pat Labeka.

Koch said, “I’m pleased that

h we sold so many books, but I

feel that more students could
have used it.” Koch explained
that the students save money
both by selling their used books
and buying other students’ books
at a lower price. “Unfortunately,
many books could not be sold

_ because instructors have changed

the required books,” Koch said.
“Student Government has ﬁlled
a need that the Book Center has
neglected,” he continued.

Student Director Chairman Mike
Bryson along with his committee
has completed the gathering of
over 95 per cent of the informa-
tions cards of full -time students,

The Student Director commit-

‘ from".

Activities

the ID Card operation to collect
the cards. The cards have been
sent to the printer who will com-
pile the 'entire book. Last year
students for_the same total cost
were forced to do much o-f the
layout and production work
themselves. '

Bryson predicted that the Di-
rectory would go on sale about
October 20 at a price of appro-
\ximate1y 30 cents per book.

Participating schools will be
Bucknell, Cornell, Penn State,
Chatham, Carnegie‘ Tech, Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania, West Vir-..
ginia, and the University.

a panel discussion on the topic:
Student involvement on campus
and the community at large. A
group discussion will follow, con-
cerning alumnae relations, ﬁ-
nances, tapping procedure, and
the formulation of a meaningful
pre‘-initiation program.

At a luncheon on the 12th ﬂoor,
CL, Mrs. Jules Labarthe, Jr., sec-
tional director of Mortar Board,
will describe the upcoming na-
tional convention. ‘

Officers for the University chap-
ter are: Janet Berson, president;
Susan Gitomer, vice-president;
Harriet Ungar,' secretary, Fran
Nicholas, treasurer; and Marsha

Rehns, editor. ;

STUDENTS ARE seen waiting in line to pick up their permanent m

Dr. Robert Levine, profes--I‘
sor of chemistry at the Uni-
versity, is now working on
what might offer a cure for.
a new strain of malaria’
which has been menacing

troops in Vietnam. 
The strain, which has infected
enough of our troops 30 WOTTY the-
defense department seems to be_
resistant to the usual anti-malaria
drugs—quinine, chloroquine, and
atabrine. f
In an exclusive interview with
The Pitt News, Dr. Levine stated,
“We do have a compound which~
looks promising. It has been test-1
ed successfully in mice and chick- ._
ens, and next will be tested in‘.
monkeys. If it passes this then it‘
will be tested in humans."
He continued, “The structure
of the compound is completely;
different from quinine and ata-=:
brine and at present we are try
ing to evolve a. theory why this‘
appears to be an effective anti-
malaria serium.” - '
The new compound is one of
1,100 chemical compounds’ cre-
ated at the University by grad-‘
uate students over the past? 20
years. A team of four Washing.‘
ton chemists who are consultants :
to the Walter Reed Army Re- '
search Institute in Washington
were the ones who ﬁrst tested;
this compound by injecting 
into mice at the University 
Miami which had already been
infected with the new strain 50»
malaria.
Dr. Levine received his B.’
and M.A. from Dartmouth Col-.
lege and his Ph.D. from Duke
University He has been withth‘e§
University since 1946 when he?
was an instructor. He has pu‘
lished in over 90 research jour
nals. His main research interests
in the ﬁeld of organic chernistr
include the synthesis of potenti
pharmaceuticals in the areas 0
cancer chemotherapy, analgesic

Dr. Levine plans to visit Isra

Israeli government. -He will visit?‘

,, .The Pittsburgh Symphony is
;_o'i1ce again commanding the stage
“of Syria Mosque. Friday evening,

liythe Symphony opened its 40th
9-season to a near capacity house,

.1-playing works by Beethoven, Res-
_"pighi and Debussy. The opening
was both disappointing and mag-

niﬁcent.

2 The program opened With Bee-
." tho.ven’s “Lenore” Overture No.

 1. “Lenore” is one of four over-
 tures‘ that Beethoven wrote ‘for
qhis, only opera, Fidelio. The Sym-
M  phony played it "with neither the
5  ~ force nor emotional output which
characterizes Beethoven’s works.

‘The themes were presented with

, V‘ speed and without warmth.

_ _ Until the closing sections of
 the second work, the “Pastoral
'-__,Symphony” of Beethoven, I was,
 bored and disenchanted. The
__ .piece which portrays the pastor-
al quality of summer, was be-
gun just like the “Lenore” Over--
zﬁture. Q

1 ~ Near the end of the selection,

.. the thunderstorm theme started
' to""be played with vigor and un-

derstanding. It was magnificent.

’ The oboe, ﬂute, clarinet and‘
' French horn exchanged places

_ with nature. There was life and
freedom in the playing and the
‘Symphony produced a storm as

Beethoven had intended.

_ The second half of the concert

«was not a gem, but came very

“close to being one. Opening with

‘~‘_Respighi’s “The ‘Fountain of

-ROme’.' (a tone poem describing

yancient Roman sculpture), Dr.

. ‘ Steinberg moulded the scene with

 his hands as a sculptor moulds

w amorphous clay. A “Claude Lor-

raine-type” Rome was produced,

“a scene dotted with running nai-

ads, tritons and sirens amidst

-the strength of ancient sculp-

   
  
   
  
  
   
 
   
   
   
  
 
 
    
  
  
  
  
   
  
  
 
 
  
    
   
   
  

The mystical quality with which

Dr. Steinberg and his associat'es
played Debussy’s “La Mer” also
. ‘helped make up for their short-
“ ‘comings during the ﬁrst half of

feet interpretation.

 Berkeley

Admits
No Slights

In a recent article, the New
York Times speaks of the trend
of the University of California
at Berkeley to “overcompensate.”'
The reference is to the efforts
being made by the campus ad-
ministration to show the error in
the idea that Berkeley has been
neglecting the undergraduate
population.

Berkeley, the site of the histor-
ic student rebellion of 1964, had
made a concerted effort to make
the entering. class feel at home
on the massive campus.

Administration and faculty

‘composed a new campus guide

book, “Berkeley: A Challenge to
Understanding.” Edited by two
upperclass students, the publica-
tion is indicative of the “new
Spirit of Berkeley."

Students of the class of 1970
are being urged to take a critical
look at themselves and also at
their opponents to try to develop
their own potential to the utmost.

_ ‘THERE HAS been some
discussion on this campus
about the revitalization of
student government‘ by way
of ‘a new constitution. But
the sad fact of this whole
issue is that student govern-
ment, by its very nature,

there should be movement, debate and student interaction, cobwebs are

Student Government is truly dragging its feet. Supposedly a focal
point for student concerns, it has had one meeting in one month where the
only resolution presented was so ill conceived that it had to be withdrawn.
The issue of out-of-state tuition has been referred to a specially appointed
committee and who knows when we’.ll ever hear from it.
Last spring a political union for the University was suggested but the
idea seems to have been lost somewhere in the marshes of student apathy.-
 much needed force on the campus, the political union could have served
as a place where the varying ideologies of the campus could have met face

‘ But one really can’t expect a political union to come to life at the Uni-
versity where student political groups are dull and ineffective. Few if any of
the supposedly “activist” groups have taken the time to presentspeakers
ororganize forums which would discuss such issues as the Selective Serv-

A ice System, ‘the Vietnam War or the national economic picture.

With the new state relation, there should be much discussion of the
Pennsylvania gubernatorial election. Again the campus groups which sup-

. port specific candidates should take the lead in sponsoring these debates.

The Student Union Board programming this year is a withering rose
in a garden of weeds. The Back Porch Majority Concert was enjoyable,
well attended and moreover free to the student body. Yet there are only

it seems. Student govern-
ment, again by its very na-
ture, is a transient organiza-
tion. Students come and go,
and proposals and policy
change with every turnover
of personnel. The situation
could very well become
chaotic if there were no ad-
ministrative veto. But what
happens when student gov-
ernment suggests a policy
change that is needed, rea-
sonable and has popular sup-
port of the student body?

In a recent article, Terrv
Hyman, chairman of the SG
Constitutional Committee
said: “The more directly and
accurately, t-he administra-
tion communicates with

those it seeks to administer. '

the more wisely it will act.”

THIS BELIEF, in my
view, is not well founded.
Hyman speaks of an academ-
ic ideal that does ‘not with-
stand the test of reality. An
administrative decision does
not always depend on direct
and accurate communication
of information, and more of-

ten than not depends on the '

personal beliefs of the ad-
ministrators. And where
state—relatedness is involved,
it is important that any poli-
cy change not shock the
“conscience of the state.” Ad-
ministrative decisions could
foreseeably become ultra-
conservative and irrational
under certain circumstances.

An example of administra-
tive irrationality occurred on
the campus of the Pennsyl-
vania State University last
year. The issue was the at-
tempted repeal of a rule on

student conduct that forbade
all female students from vis-
iting the private apartments
of male students.

AFTER ATTEMPTING to
repeal this regulation for
three years, student govern-
ment ﬁnally convinced the
administration to aid in poll-
ing students, parents and
faculty. In a statistically ac-
curate survey, 70 per cent of
the students favored aboli-
tion of the rule, while almost
an equal number of parents
and faculty favored no

' change.

Finally, after repeated stu-
dent protests, the adminis-
tration submitted a substi-
tute for the rule, which did
little to change is original
substance. Student govern-
ment rejected the proposal
unanimously and submitted
its own which met with wide
student support.

A STUDENT council now

‘had a chance to become a

student government in the
true sense of the word. But

the administration didn’t

agree and countered: _“Im—

a responsibility to protect

our coeds.” “It has been our ,

own experience in this area

' that students are not respon-

sible enough to make their
own decisions.” The student

government p ro p o s al was
dead.

But this was mature poli-
tics. Coeds were asking to
protect themselves. Seventy
percent of the students’ felt
they were responsible.

‘On that day ‘a student
council remained a student
council. '

“Snoopy

By HOBART HARRIS

It is 3 a.m. somewhere in the
heart of France. Crawling under
the barbed wire and between
tank traps is a courageous World
War I pilot. Strong soldiers
blanch upon seeing him, and
why not? The beagle has always
been a ferocious beast and the
Daisey Hill Puppy Farm is known
for its breeding prowess.

Snoopy and the Red Baron,
and
Winston's cover blurb as “the
war novelists war novel,” is a 60
page volume of Snoopy’s cartoon
adventures with the Red Baron.
Snoopys ﬁgmented ﬂight with

papers last term, and have now
been reprinted in this ﬁne,
Schultz-quality work.

Snoopy has never been an im-
posing ﬁgure, and decked out in
a woolen scarf and ﬂying hel-
met he looks ridiculous. His Sop-
with Camel has a strange resem-
blance to a doghouse, and he is
the only known pilot to have
walked away from a crash land-

ing in a supper dish. The dog is‘

indestructible‘. Unfortunately, his
plane is not.

As the book begins, Snoopy
has just been shot down again,
and he isn’t happy. He holds the
record for being defeated more
times in mortal combat with the

Red Baron than any other man.
He has crash landed into almost
every ﬁeld in France.

There are compensations, like
the beautiful French farm girl
who seduces the handsome Bea-
gle in a bowl o-f potato soup.
There are admiring glances for
Snoopy as he makes it back to
the base after a crash landing.

Air warfare has always attract-
ed the most daring of men who
go into combat with the names
of their Gods on their lips. Snoopy
chooses to be diﬁerent. “Nyahh,
Nyahh, Nyahh, you can't hit me!"
he smirkes. He should know bet-
ter.

The most curious aspect of

Snoopy’s battl-es is that-they are,

of course, ﬁgments of his own
imagination. They are daydreams,
and Snoopy is the dreamer. If
Snoopy wanted to win, all he
would have to do is dream it.
Yet he loses.

As a matter of fact, Snoopy has
always been a lousy dreamer.
Snoopy never did suceed as a vul-
ture. He never did get Linus’
blanket away from him. His dog-
house was saved from the wreck-
ers only because the state chose
not to destroy it. Time has taught
Snoopy a hard lesson. Perhaps he
hasn’t admitted defeat conscious-
ly, but it looks like something is
wrong. .

Snoopy is losing his dogﬁghts
to a Baron. He conjured up in a
war resurrected in his daydreams.
He is losing to his own progeny.
“S0medaY I’ll get you Red Bar-
on!” Someday Snoopy’s dremn
will come to an end.

DefensiveUnit ComestoLifeAgainstDuke 

Another Day

Sophomore Parrott
Typifies New Poise

By Tom Sacks
Sports Editor

Lo-u Parrott slammed his fist into the turf. For a mo-
ment he appeared to hesitate, disgusted with himself. But
only for a moment. He quickly picked himself up and head-

ed for sidelines.

Duke’s Jay Calabrese ‘had just run 14 yards through the
left side of the Panther defense for the Blue Devils’ second

and winning touchdown.

Parrott’s a sophomore who was playing outside line-
backer Saturday. It was the ﬁrst time in his life he had

ever been assigned to the linebacker spot.

According to both head coach Dave Hart and lineback-
ing coach Dick Bestwick, Parrott played a good game for
someone as green as he was. He might have made some tac-
tical mistakes, but that’s up to the game ﬁlms to reveal. But

 
   

LINEBACKER. LOU PA.R.ROT'l‘

if he did make some mis-
takes, they weren’t glaring.
What did glare was the way
he hit and hit hard.

His play was reminiscent
of the bruising Panther tac-
kles of the past. To a degree
he personiﬁed the sudden ag-
gressiveness of this year’s
defensive unit. It was an ag-
gressiveness poured upon an
unsuspecting Duke team Sat-
urday. And most important
of all, it was an aggressive-
ness inspired by the show-
ing against UCLA last week.

Throughout the ﬁrst half
of Saturday’s game, Jim
Flanigan’s defensive unit was
penalized for piling on. These
penalties might have hurt in
terms of yardage, but not in
terms of spirit..

The defense which had at- -
tempted to stop UCLA was
inexperienced and awed. Not
one Panther defender had
been acquainted with his
position prior to this year.

Maybe they were afraid of making mistakes in Califor-
nia. And maybe because of this they weren’t hitting in the

Coliseum.

This is how Parrott explains it now, “Before mistakes
used to shake me up. But now I just think -of the next play.
That’s the only way I can keep my composure out there.”

— Parrott is small in terms of linebackers, but “I’m not
weak.” Hart has called Parrott the best tackler on the team.

“It’s hard to explain what makes a good tackler,” says
Lou. “In high school you’re taught to leave your feet and
go for the ru«nner’s midsection. But you can’t leave your

feet in college. The runners here are just too good.

“Now t-hey teach us to use our heads. If _.you put your
~ head right through their numbers, you can’t miss. When I
see a ball carrier coming, the only thing I care about is him.”

At New Castle Parrott played in the defensive backﬁeld
during his senior year. That’s where he played against
UCLA. But when Hart readjusted the defense for Duke,

Parrott was moved up to linebacker.

He likes the change. “I’m closer to the action now. When
I was in the backﬁeld, l’d hesitate because I was worried

about somebody beating me deep.”

He was in on the action Saturday. He was in on the
tackle which put Duke quarterback Al Woodall out of the
game with a dislocated elbow. He was also responsible for
knocking Dave Dunaway, their best receiver, off stride at
the line of scrimmage. Dunaway only caught one pass.

There is no answer to just why the defense was so ﬁred
up against Duke and not UCLA. As Parrott says, “The prae-.

tice prior to Duke was just different.”

Whatever the difference was, the Panther defenders

'- now have some poise and conﬁdence. As with Parrott, they
" . still have a lot to learn; but they’re learning fast.

Poor Punt Coverage
Causes Loss, 14-7

By - GEORGE LIES

Aggressive defensive football, the kind
that wins games, was evident at the Sta-

dium Saturday. There was a great differ-

ence between the defense which allowed 57
points last week and one which grudgingly gave
seven points to Duke.

Duke realized it the ﬁrst time they tried an
offensive play. Terry Hoover let them know. From
his left linebacker position, he dumped senior
Mike Shasby for an eight yard loss.

J acke Devonshire, the Duke tailback, realized it
the first time he carried the ball. Cornerback Bob-
by Dyer showed him. Ffom the Panther 40 to the
25-yard line, Devonshire thought it wasn’t true.

When he got to the 25, however, he had a change,

of mind. He fumbled the ball into Dyer’s waiting
arms.

Paul Killian made a believer out of Jay Cala-
brese, the Duke fullback. After a one yard loss the
first time he carried, Calabrese thought he might
score a touchdown. Running from the Panther 19-
yard line, h-e made it to the ﬁve. Here he fumbled.
Killian recovered the ball.

And what of the Duke quarterback, Todd Or-
vald, who replaced the injured Al Woodall? Joe
Curtin taught him a few facts of fgotball. Orvald
threw deep into the end zone to all-America can-
didate Dave Dunaway, who wasn’t used much
throughout the game, but Curtin jumped high for
an interception.

Even many of the sparse gathering (24,684)
in the stands realized it. They saw these turn-
abouts which stopped cold three Duke drives in
the ﬁrst half.

Head coach Dave Hart surely knows it. He said
so. “There’s no question about it, our defense im-
proved greatly over last week. The defense was
up, but it was our fault (=the coaches) they had
so many penalties (seven for 88 yards).

“I told the coaches not to say anything to them
though,” Hart said. “I would rather have them
over-aggressive -than have them lay-back and
wait.”

In pre-season interviews, Hart said he loaded
the defense with the best players. He wanted them
to be tacklers.

But he may have left the offense void of tacklers
on a third down play, with four yards to go for
a ﬁrst down,,the strategists decided to punt. With

the score 7-0 favoring the Panthers, Aldo Zortea

kicked from his own 11-yard line.
Duke’s Andy Beath grabbed the ball on the 49,

and breaking away from several Panthers, ran"

MIKE RAKLEWICZ leaps over right guard from
two yards out in the ﬁrst quarter for the Panthers’
only touchdown in the 14-7 loss to Duke, Saturday.

for a touchdown. In this instance, the offense
could have used a tackler. Just one might have
saved the game.

“The offense let us down,” Hart. “And that
punt caused us the loss.

“A 7-0 score at the half would have made us
a lot better-off,” Hart continued. “It’s not nice
to lose.

“The offense didn’t sprint after the runner.
They took everything for granted,” Hart said. “We
had not practiced against the punt return and
Zortea didn’t work enough on this. He was sup-
posed to cover on the play, but he went down
as soon as someone hit him. This won’t happen

again.” .

Scoring-wise, fullback Mike Raklewicz bolted
from Duke’s two-yard line for the Panthers open-
ing (and only) touchdown. The play climaxed a
72-yard drive in which quarterback Ed James
twice completed passes to split end Bob Longo on
third down and long yardage situations.

In the third quarter Duke’s Calabrese drove
into right end, slipped out of thearms of Joe
Curtin and ran 14 yards for the winning touch-
down.

Booters Apply All the Pressure,

By MIKE BROURMAN

West Chester is known as a pressure team.
Against the booters on Saturday, they were more
of a pressured team. Yet, they escaped this pres-
sure long enough to score two goals, and then
hang on for a 2-1 victory.

The Rams had only one offensive chance in
the ﬁrst half, but they made the most of it. All-
America Bobby Lieb drilled home a shot with
less than two minutes gone. It was their only shot
until the second half. V

Except for Lieb’s goal, the play was all the
booters’. Led by A1 Traunsteiner, they applied
the pressure constantly, but couldn’t put the ball
in the net.

West Chester escaped again early in the third
quarter, and managed to get off one shot. Again
it tallied, and they had a 2-0 lead. It was the last
shot they were to get.

The booters came right back after West Chest-
er's goal, and got one of their own. Traunsteiner
connected on a penalty kick, cutting the deﬁcit to
one goal.

It was a goal they never could get. 'I'hey kept
up the pressure, and made rush after rush at the
Ram's goal, but the nets were not disturbed.

The Rams heaved sighs of relief as they left
the ﬁeld after time ran out. As Lieb put it, “This is
the toughest team I’ve ever played, and we’ve
played the best. They’re tougher than Navy was.”

In its ﬁrst real challenge of
the year, the cross-country team
placed third in a triangular meet
with Ohio University and Kent
State Saturday.

The ﬁnal score was Ohio 28,
Kent 49, and Pitt 57. The one
bright spot for the harriers was
the showing of Frank Handle-
man, who ﬁnished fourth. The
remaining harriers, Fran. Shor,
Ken Lawton, Larry Hubner, and
Paul Gregg, ﬁnished 11th, 12th,
114th, and 15th, respectively.

Leading Ohio U’s attack was
Mel Williams, who is ranked ﬁfth
nationally, and John Blair, who
ﬁnished ﬁfth. Sam Blair, who
runs the mile in 4:04 copped ﬁrst
place for Kent with a time of
25:53.8, while his teammate Pete
Lorandeau, who is ranked eighth
nationally, ﬁnished third.

Ohio University’s well-balanced
running was the key factor in
their victory. In past years, Ohio

Does water pollution bug you? Or smog? Does it
concern you that some places in the country never
have enough teachers‘? Or nurses? And when you
read about the growing pains of a developing na-

 

has always had one of the better
teams in the country. - .
Regardless of the dual defeat,
Coach Banner’s cross - country
team still has high hopes for the
remaining meets with Gannon
College on October 8; Grove City,

October 15; West Virginia, Octo-
ber-22; and Penn State on Nov. 5.

The harriers will continue run-
ning ten miles daily in an effort
to improve their times for the
IC4A meet held in New York
on November 14.

You can. Thousands of General Electric people
