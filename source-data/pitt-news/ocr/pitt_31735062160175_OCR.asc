Mag ‘Clean-Up’ Move

Men’s Council and the Newman Club embarked on a
«campaign this_ week to “clean up” the Panther, student

humor magazine.

Expressing particular disapproval of the Panther’s re-

cent parody, “True Concessions,”
Council voted unanimously Tues-
day to ask the University publica-
tions) board to take “constructive
Vaction to clean up The Panther.
, magazine.” V
Last week-end the Newman
Club sent a resolution of protest
to Panther Editor Paul Schwarz.

Boycott ‘Threatened
The resolution, copies of which
were sent to the dean of men and
women and to 16 campus religious
organizations, read in part, “that
until the Pitt Panther can meet

it the standards of the Legion of De-

cency the members of. the Pitt
Newman Club will refuse to buy,

sell, or read the magazineﬂ

Schwarz, in reply, made this
statement to The News:
‘ “We realize that the quality “of
the last issue did not measure up
to previous parodies in respect to
humor. It is probably for this rea-
son that certain situations—inher-
ent in the magazine we were p‘ar-
odying—were interpreted as vul-
gar rather than funny. Let me em-
phasize that such an effect was not
our purpose.” K

Meritspwin
Six of Eight
SC Posts

By BOB THOMAS
(See column, Page 4)
Interfraternlty Council took
it on the chin Wednesday.
In fact, it was almost a com-

plete knockout. as the audacious
Merit Party swept six of its

eight candidates into next year’s‘

Student Congress.

Only two IF men won offices-a
senior position to Don Milletary
and a junior position to Dan Ber-
ger. He got the most votes among
the men-888.

It was the worst beating the IF
has ever taken in student elec-
tions.

Merit Winners
. Merit Party victors were Larry
Adler, Joe Marasco, and Bob Os-
terhout for senior positions and
Lloyd Fuge, Dan Purdy, and Ross
Reese for junior, jobs.

The Merit Party crushed IF
with insurgent fraternity men as
well as independents.

But it didn’t do so well in the
Men’s Council contests. Only Don-
ald Day, running for a bus ad
sophomore position, came through
for the merit men. In the Edu-
cation contest, Merit Party-back-
ed Paul Schrading tied with Dave
Lichtman of‘ IF. The tie will be
broken later by an internal vote
of the new Men’s Council mem-
bers, it was decided by the Elec-
tions Committee.

Busy for Congress

Second of a Series
By ELINORE STONE

A number of innovations

kept SC busy on campus last

year. The successful alumni-student train trip to Notre Dame

‘was a feather in Congress’s cap as well as that of the Pitt

News and Alumni Association, the co-sponsorers. A day to

honor Pitt fathers at football%

games was instigated and repeated
this year.

The SC Decorum Committee
asked that action be taken to pro-
tect students from ‘the “unwar-
conduct” of excessive

ously been mistaken for ushers
enforced this attitude a bit more
emphatically this year.
Commons Room Dance

And, through Congress, a pre-
eedent was set. A_dream became
a reality when the Common’s

‘Room Committee of SC at long

last secured permission to hold
dances in -the Commons Room and
the Senior’s graduation ball
brought new life to the Gothic
Hall. - ~ '
In the spring of 1951, SC again

gavel of!’ authority fell to Cyril
Wecht. I
This year’s Student Congress
‘ has much to recommend it. .Its
seven months of activity have
been marked by a number of
ﬁrsts.
On November E 30, SC held a

' Student Government Day, consist-

ing ‘of panel discussions, informal
meetings, talks, and an open meet-
ing of the governing body for all
students and Congress members.
Second Newspaper Suggested
When Jim Furbee introduced
the idea of a second student news-
paper last Fall, Congress‘ backed
him and through their new Polling
Committee,‘ polled the student

. body to discover their ,feelings on

the notion. The idea died. Con-
gress also came out in favor of
girl cheerleaders and is still ﬁght-
ing to keep this innovation from
the grave.

p The bloodmobile came to Pitt
under SC sponsorship twice last
September, collecting 393 pints
of blood on the first trip. It will
return Mayvl and 2 for a third
drive.

Two thousand seven hundred
and ﬁfty-one students received
free chest x-rays last December
when SC brought a mobile x-ray
unit to Pitt. On May 6 through 9,
free x-rays will be given again.

Food Service Investigated

Also “in the interest of student
welfare,” SC investigated the Uni-
versity Food Services—Cafeteria

the prices‘ are so high and where

« ternity and sorority actions, hous-

ing practices, and discriminatory

gs ll4,—-THE "PITT NEWS ’ emaay,

As the result of a particularly inept par-
ody issue, the Panther is currently the object
of some rather indignant and scathing criti-
cism. This is, of course, not the ﬁrst time it _

has been attacked for its interpretation of the

level of college humor.

Butthis is the ﬁrst time any sizable num-
ber of organized students has expressed dis-
satisfaction. In the past they have been con-
tent to publicly damn the Panther and to pri-
vately snicker at its contents. Or, if they
were sufficiently disguested, they simply re-

. fused to buy a copy, apparently content to

let the rest of the population ‘sink into im-
morality but determined at all costs to re-
main pure ‘themselves. ’ ' ' —
In this case, however, the Newman
Club has decided to take action in the
form of circulating a resolution a reso-
lution which charges the Panther with
being a “vulgar, base and repulsive ma-
gazine.” The Newmans further declare
‘ that they will “refuse to buy, sell or
read the magazine” until it conforms to
the “standards of the Legion of Decen-
cy.” This" petition was greeted warmly
in Men’s Council where it received a
wholeheartedly endorsement.

If the Newmans had restricted their criti-
cism to the “True Concessions” issue and if
they hadtbeen willing to restrict their reme-
dies to a general improvement of the maga-
zine, they would have found us largely in
agreement with them. In our opinion the
parody was a failure as humor and something

less as a magazine.
' - * * >1< *

..~ The Newmans threaten to boycott. the

magazine until it conforms to the standards

 of the Legion of Decency. As they must know

the Legion is an instrument for policing their
morals and not those of people who follow
other religions. What maybe a sin for them

1.» may not bea sin for a Protestant or Jew.

’We are not implying that the°Newman

If Club because of its affiliations ‘with the Cath-

o‘-lic Church does not have-the right to pass
judgment on the Panther and-to urge others

J to join with it. They are just as free to con-

demn the magazine as they are to refrain

A from reading it.

,. But we want to point out the dangers
inherent in any form of censorship,
which is precisely what the Newmans are

. advocating. If the editors of the Pan-
ther must write their copy with one
eye cocked on the Newman Club, an-

. other on‘ the Westminster Foundation,-
always keeping in mind the fact that
the Orthodox Jews dislike certain things
and the Baptists are prone to cavil about
drinking, they might as Well quit.

It is this sort of censorship, based on con-
ventional morality, which has turned the
movie industry into a lily—1ivered branch of
the arts. It has prevented many honest men
from exposing much that is ugly in our so-
, ciety and behind its facade of respectibility it

I has promoted more injustice than a dozen

“True Concessions” could even achieve.
I Any sort of censorship, wether it be pro-
scribed by rule or law, imposed by social

_pressure, practiced by euphemism or ordain- A
ed by religion, is essentially selfdlegating and

will inevitably betray those people whom it
seeks to protect. You can not forever prevent
people from discovering that all is not on
the up—and-up in Denmark.

In a University where the unrestricted

lpursuit of the truth is one of the cardinal

ideals, we cannot see how anyone can in good
conscience propose a form of censorship.
Here, if nowhere else, we should encourage
freedom of inquiry and, especially, freedom
of expression.
* * * *

We do not want to confuse the obvious
poor taste of one edition of the Panther with
a great American principle. We think that
if the Newmans recognize that it was in
poor taste and if they also recognize that
their action is a potential threat to a basic
liberty, they will withdraw it. They have

plenty of reason for their indignation, but
no justiﬁcation at all for their action.

If they find’ that they cannot alter their
position we suggest they place a little faith
in the students who run the Panther anr‘
hope for the best. We feel certain the fa?“
‘will not be misplaced.

per descended on ,the,mu1t.itude
with a torrential ﬂuttering and
moaning. .
Not the least heroic of these
wood-pulp philanthropists was
junior Bill Pentecost who un-

“Cyril,” he said, “it’s a bit dirty
here.”

“It will be done,” said Cyril.

And it was. .

All the politicians pitched in
and with A mighty’ sweep of
brooms and brushes soon sub-

a doubter, look at the picture on

Many were the profound state-

But the most ‘profound of the
profundity issued from the

mouth of sophomore Congress

in the afternoon when I talked ,

“I’m beat,” he said. ‘ s

Ir: the same vein was another
commentrfromi a Congress can-
didate. “If I win today,” he said,
“I’1l be so happy I’ll work like a

Hard-working members of the

Tuesday night. Someone slipped
into the YMCA ofﬁce on the

mimeographed machine and rac-

At 9 a.m., Wednesday both
were on the ﬁring line, smiling
but weary, passing outpropa-

They discovered the missing

Cle,an|iness Not All  
° ‘JACK MARKOWITZ s

A “freedom of the press” argument should be
enough to quell the present rebellion against‘ the
Panther’s most recent ticklings of the funny bone.

That argument is an important one, and in the
light of it, the publications board is unlikely to
forceably “clean up” the Panther. But pressure
from the advocates of cleanliness on the printed
page may‘we1l force the maga-
zine’s editors themselves to
change Panther policy (which
has incidentally always aimed, ;
not for vulgarity, but for hu-:*_
mor.) g '

Cleanliness seems to be the
virtue most in demand on a col-
lege magazine. It need not be a
good magazine, so long as it is ‘
‘‘c1ean.’’ It is argued ‘that great

humorists——lVlark Twain, Char1ie"Chaplin—-did“ not

stoop to telling "‘of‘f-color” jokes, and the ﬁeld of!
clean. humor is broad enough to keep a college boy
writing for some -time. Such an argument,
course, ignores such reasonably good hufmoristsxasv
Aristophanes, Moliere and Shakespeare, who were
not above spicing up the-third act a bit with a little
shrewd lewdness. ,

The advocates of “cleanliness” think they will

ldivert college humor from the sinful to the noble. ,

They will not; they will divert it from the funny to
the dry. . I ‘ '

The most refreshing thing about college humor I

is the very thing the “clean” advocates attack--its
irrepressible irreverence concerning the things so-
ciety is most solemn about-—_success, money, rem
spectability, and mainly and above all, sex.

College humor is a relentless ,needle——a punc-

turer of ideals, such as sex morality, which may 
good, but which are held so self—righteously that

they are an excellent target. The good college mags \
‘azines spoof us, make us appear just a little foolish, .
make us see ourselves as the irreverent, who are

not such a depraved lot, see us.’
Thus, at its best, and that is not its “cleanest,”
it is-refreshingly clean. in a better sense.‘ It is

frank and open and says the most outrageous“
”’ things, but makes uslaugh at them and‘ at our-_- .

selves. He who cannot appreciate a good “oﬁ-color”

joke or thinks it a wicked thing ismissing some _

of life’s heartiest and most educational’ laughter.
The real distinction the Panther editors must

make is not between ,“cleanliness” and “di.rtiness," ~

"but betweenstuff that makes you laugh and, stuff
that doesn’t. Some recent Panther Tnaterial has

been vulgar without having-the saving grace of -

being humorous. That kind of E vulgarity is repulx-1

sive to an, and the editors know it, and they are
more embarassed by it than the cleanliness boys
could possibly be.

I Claim the Record  l

DAVE wmmz 1

Since the Depression, the American student has
been characterized as “working mylway through
college,” If you’re not ‘among the 60 per cent of
Pitt students who work part or fulltime you know
people who do work between studying and (some.-
‘times)_sleeping. I’ve ‘worked, too, at jobs ranging
from. two years as a soda jerk to two weeks aS.-1'2’
funeral parlor receptionist. ,

But I claim, again modestly 3
that last year I held the biggest _
strangest assortment of jobs that 
a student has ever‘ ja‘mm—ed int i
one year.

In 1951 I was, at one time or .
§_ another, a gandy-dancer, photo‘
lab technician, truck-driver,
book-stacker, stee1,_ plant “bur
ner,” gold miner, teacher’s read-
er, accordionist, nose-tester for a cigarette com-
pany, post office clerk, dishwasher, newspaper col-
umnist of sorts, harvest worker, and, as an AFROTC

student, a government servant. _ -.

Why? Because I believe being a Jack-of-alh
Trades is the best kind of preparation for being
master of one. I believe you gravitate toward a
specialty, without consciously selecting it until you
have to jump or go back. 0

‘Informal education is the kind that a Jack—of-
all-Trades tries to steal from the world andpthe

 

people in it. It’s the kind a shine boy can get. It’s"

the kind of education that most people stop getting’
as they ‘grow ,olde,jg, and some people never get.
It’s a knowledge of life, how to get along, with

other people, and a “thief” steals what he thinks

valuable, without worrying about other people’s

g standards. -

Informal education can be learning how to pitch

:1 tent in a high wind, how to tie a bow tie or make, u
love, how to bake a cake or write a short story, mop,

a ﬂoor swiftly, or pick up the right fork.

In any case, you can’t learn an)’.t,h.ing‘from"a,

Reilly is really on the ball.

And it’s quite natural, too, that Bob
Reilly is Pitt’s top golfer and ace—in-the-
hole‘, when his past is recalled.

In successive steps, the curly-haired golf
er first learned how to walk. That was
natural. But shortly after those initial ales-

 

,sons,,his orientation to athletics began.

, - Six Losses in Three Years
At the age of four, his two golﬁng brothers,
Bill and Ralph, wrapped a club in his ivory-

pure hands, and young Robert had his first toy

--a golf stick.

That toy might have been great child's play,
then, but now Reilly wield: a mighty club for
Coach Dave McCormick. In three years the 21
year-old pre-med senior has lost six of 21 matches.

Four of those were registered against him in
1950, his ﬁrst varsity year; and last year, only
Dick Knee of St. Francis bettered Reilly on the
greens. In two matches this year, the three-time
golf captain has been top medalist for Pitt.

"The hardest thing about shooting a couple
holes of golf when we were kids,” Bob recalls,
“was ﬁnding a place to play. No onewanted us
hanging around. But I managed to get a lot of
professional training, anyway.”

Standout in High School

‘Most of the advice, however, came second-
hand. “My brothers picked up valuable tips from
Ray Cerer, the pro at Alcoma Country Club, and

Carl Benjan, a pro somewhere in Cleveland. They,

in turn,” he laughed, “passed it along to me.”

How good is Reilly then‘?

Well, he's been number oneiman on the Pitt
squad ,for three years, placed eighth in the West
Penn Open in l95Q,‘and, while a senior at West
View High in 1948, won the local Hearst Junior
Tournament. C

Reilly went on to capture third place in the

Hearst nationals that year.

As for Pitt’s golfers, Captain Reilly claims,
“this years squad is the best in the past four
years.”

16 Thinclads Entered
In Penn Relays Today

By JACK DAVEY _
Coach Carl Olson has assigned a rugged task to 16 of
his outstanding thinclads by entering them in the Penn

Relays at Philadelphia today

and tomorrow.

Competition will be provided by:

the best track and ﬁeld men. in
the country in preparation for the
Olympic games this summer. Spe-
cial permission to enter the meet
has been granted to a number of
men serving in the army ‘and navy.

Michigan, Morgan State, and
Manhattan stand the best chance
of winning the team title accord-
ing to Olson, with Michigan being
rated the best of the three.

King, Monahan Invited
Only one relay team will run

for the Blue-and-Gold this after-,

noon--the distance medley team
composed of Frank Kuzma, Ray
Lee, Dick Weber, and Dan Som-
mers. Six other men have been
entered in ﬁve events.

Clyde King and Wally Monahan
received invitations to compete in
the special 120-yard high hurdle
event, while the Panthers will be
represented in the broad jump,
discus, two mile run and the high
jump. -

King and Monahan have con-
sistently turned in good times in

the hurdles and should stand a

good chance of placing in this
event.
Kuzma To Meet Competition
a On Saturday the shuttle hurdle
relay team of Monahan, King,
Kennedy and Bill Reuschel will
try for gold medals.
Olson has the mile relay team
of Dave Denman, Joe Dudas,
Bruce Giron and Lee and the four-

mile relay team of Kuzma,, Weber, ’

Dawson Likes

Hefty. Linemen

By DON SCIIURMAN

One of Coach Lowell Daw-O‘

\son’s- most distressing prob-

lems when spring training be- —

gan—a shortage of linemen of
big league caliber—-has been par-
tially solved.

While no new candidates have
entered training at Trees Field
since then, the performances of
several holdovers from last year's

squad have been more than grat- I

ifying to Pitt’s ﬁrst year coach.

Especially promising are the ..

tackles where Dawson’s lightest
contender is 212-pound Bill Priat-
ko.

«Along with 220-pound Eldred
Kraenier and 215-pound Lou Pal-
atella, the hefty sophomore has
been one of Dawson's mostichee-,r—
ing prospects in the spring work-

outs.

But Dawson is even more op-
timistic about his ends. “Compar-
atively, I have quite a few out-
standing ends,” he says.

“Besides Dick Deitrick, I can use

,Joe Zombek, Joe Bozek, or Bill

Adams,” he adds. Since both Zom-
bek and Bozek played strictly on
defense last year, Adams might
well be the man to ﬁll the big
shoes of graduating Chris War-
riner.

“We’re happy we won.”

Said Reese, “Frankly, the rea-

harder. We had more eﬂfective
publicity and better men.”

PMerit-man winner Dan Purdy
claimed they won because “each
candidate on the Merit Party went
out and pushed for the group as

Adler proclaimed, “The merit

The Merit Party sprang up as 51
