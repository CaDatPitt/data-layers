research on
anti—aging
develops at
  Pitt  

By Kelly Lyons

It’s not the fountain of youth, but
when it comes to anti—aging serums,

~ Pitt researchers might have made a

breakthrough.

Two Pitt researchers have
launched a collaborative effort be-
tween their stem cell research center
and aging lab to discover the impact
that stem cells could have on aging
mice. The researchvresulted in mice
living two to three times longer than
they otherwise would have, and re—
searchers said thatin some time, the
results might be applied to slowing
human aging.

Johnny Huard, senior researcher
and director of Pitt’s stem cell re-
search center, and Laura Niedern—
hofer, senior researcher and associ-
ate professor for the department of
Microbiology and Molecular Genetics
at Pitt’s Cancer Institute, began their
four-year experiment to study the
effects of muscle—derived stem/pro-
genitor cells (MDSPCS) on the health
and life spans of mice. The research-
ers infected mice with progeria — a
rare genetic disease that causes ac-
celerated aging — in order to parallel
the animals’ aging process to that of
humans. !

Neidernhofer said the mice with
progeria age similarly to adult hu-
mans.

“They start to tremble. They get
a hunched back because they have
osteoporosis, and they don’t move

as quickly,” she said, adding that the

SGB drop boxes not completely foolproof  

Graduate and CGS students won’t be shut out from accessing New York Times and USA Today

Studies students as initially
intended. The boxes won’t be
able to differentiate between
students of each school. The
Board initially suspended the
program because there was no
way to prevent people outside
the School ofArts and Sciences
from picking up the paper.

“If you have a [student] ID,
you can.get a paper,” Board
member Alex Murdoch said.
“It’s kind of like we are still
funding for those grad stu-
dents.”

During winter break, the
Board decided to halt the pro-
gram until locked drop boxes,

which would limit the papers
to only those students paying
the student activities fee, were
implemented.

The. locked drop boxes
would not cost any extra and
are includedin the cost of the
program, which cost $30,500
during the pilot stage.

Murdoch voted at the Jan.
24 SGB meeting to discontinue
the program because he did not
think it was the responsibility

I of the Student Activities Fund

to pay for the papers. He said
that he plans on voting in favor
of waiting for the locked drop
boxes to avoid immediate>dis—

tribution of the newspapers.

Board member Halim Genus
also voted against the program
at Tuesday night’s meeting. He,
like Murdoch, said that he does
not think the Student Activities
Fund should pay for newspa-
pers.

“I am not against newspa-
pers and information,” Genus
said. “The student activities fee
is to pay for student activities

tions  It shouldn’t fund for an
individual’s morning paper.”

Experts analyze Republican primary before Tuesday’s vote   

Gingrich’s strong showing in South Ca'rolina‘lea:ues experts wondering‘ the fate of the Republican field-

By Nate Kreichman
For the Pitt News

There are three candidates left
ﬁghting for the Republican presi-
dential nominee, and each has
won a state primary. But this
doesn’t mean the race is split be-
tween three different, qualiﬁed
candidates. ~

Allan Lichtman, a history pro-
fessor at American University,
said that this Republican presi-
dential election is more superﬁ-
cial than substantive.

“[The Republican Primary is]

a clash of personalities more than -

anything else. The great major-
ity‘ of Republican primary voters
could not spell out the differences
among these candidates on issues
like taxes, regulation, abortion
and immigration, [because] there

really isn’t one,” Lichtman said.

Thus far, three states have held
a primary or caucus, and each has
produced a different winner —— a
phenomenon that is not uncom-
mon in presidential primary sea-
son.

Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick
Santorum took Iowa and former
Massachusetts governor Mitt
Romney took New Hampshire be-
fore former Speaker of the House
Newt Gingrich’s victory in South
Carolina Saturday night.

Republican party is not as ideo-

' logically fractured as the primary

season makes it seem.

In 2004 and 2008, three dif-
ferent presidential candidates
won in each of "the ﬁrst three
states to vote in the Republican
primary season, while in 2000
then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush
took Alaska and Iowabefore Ari-
zona Sen. John McCain won in
New Hampshire. .

In 2008, former Arkansas p

governor Mike Huckabee won
the Iowa caucuses while eventual
Republican winner McCain came
in fourth. McCain won a narrow
victory over Huckabee in South
Carolina, further cementing the
state’s reputation as a bellwether
for the Republican nomination.

The winner of South Carolina’s
Republican primary has gone on
to take the party’s nomination in
every election since 1980.

But Casey Rankin, president of
Pitt College Republicans, pointed
out that unlike this year, in the
past the winner has taken either
Iowa or New Hampshire before
claiming the Palmetto state. _

“We’re looking at unchart-
ed territory in historical terms,”
Rankin said. “[South Carolina]
is really not a good predictor of
what’s going to happen next.”

Victor, who said she believes
Romney will be the Republican

nominee, agreed that the events «

of the past week were not enough
for her to change that belief.
Romney’s campaign is built

around the notion that he can

create jobs-, and Rankin claimed

.— dents and non—affiliates on

their rosters, but undergradu-
ates must make up _75rpercent
of the membership, said Glyn
Cozart, a student employee at
the Student Organization Re-
source Center.

Board Presidentjames Lan-
dreneau was unable to state
what percentage of the pa-
pers were picked up by gradu-

he does have that capability.
“He has experience in business

and the private sector. I think he

understands how we can create

jobs and get the economy going,”

Rankin said. ,
Gingrich’s campaign is based
upon his newfound momentum
and a conservative grassroots
movement, which up_ until this

point has been split between a-

number of candidates but seems
to have ﬁnally settled on him. _To
that end,- Gingrich has continu-

. ally cast himself as a “Washington

outsider” feared by the party es-
tablishment. Victor said the out-
sider suggestion is “disconnected
from reality.” A I .
“The idea that the party is
scared suggests that he’s some-

‘ how not the Republican party.

That’s ‘ridiculous, he’s the former
Speaker of the House,” Victor
said. “There isn’t a more Republi-
can Republican than Gingrich.”
Litchman said that Gingrich’s

surprise win in South Carolina ,

is mostly due to an anti—Romney
sentiment in the electorate. Up to
this point, the anti—Romney vote
has been split between a number
of candidates, including Santo-
rum, Texas Gov. Rick Perry and
Minnesota Rep. Michele Bach-
mann. Since the latter two have
dropped out of the race, conser-
vative support has swayed toward
Gingrich. ' . ’
“The Republican electorate”
doesn’t want Romney and now
they seem to have focused on a
single alternative in Newt_ Gin-
grich,” Lichtman said. “I don’t

think this is so much that they
love Gingrich more but that they
love Romney less.’’

, Heading to Florida ‘

Gingrich and Romney have
emerged as front-runnersyiin the
race, andthe candidates’ atten-

, tion is now on Florida, which will

hold its primary onjan. 31.
Campaigning, and even voting,
has already begun in the state as
advertisements crowd television
screens and voters mail in absen-
tee ballots. Victor said the state
is less conservative than Iowa and
South Carolina, because of more

urbanization and a large 'immi- _

grant population.
V Lichtman agrees. He said that
the state requires a different kind
of campaigning due to its_ size and
diversity. I

Rankin pointed out that Flor-
ida is the nation’s fourth most
populated state, one of the big-
gest geographically and home to a
number of expensive media mar-
kets. Other candidates may not be
able to compete with Romney’s
highly organized and well-funded
campaign. ‘ -

“It’s impossible to do enoug
town halls and campaign stops to
connect with each voter like you
could in South Carolina or Iowa
or New Hampshire,” he said. “It’s
going to be about getting on TV,

being able to afford advertising

and organization.”

’ Additionally, Lichtman said
the primary process is mutually
dependent and that Gingrich’s

lege of General students,.but ,

member Gordon Louderback.

He said if thepapers remained ».

win in South Carolina could trans-

late into success in Florida and
beyond. ‘ ' ‘
Moving into Florida, Rankin

- said he believes Gingrich will be

unable to compete with Romney’s
organization, and that the former
governor will start to pull away

with the lead over the course of ,

the next week.
. Victor said she still believes

Romney will win in the end, but _

she would not be surprised by
either candidate taking Florida,
noting that a Romney victory

. would be the result of fundraising
A and organization, while a Ging-

rich victory-would be the result
of momentum and a grassroots

following. E_ithe_f way, shelsaid ‘

“there’s going to bea ‘good ex-
planation.” .   _ if ' '

Gingrich hastheedge in Licht-
man’s eyes, but he said the former
Speaker is “eminently” capable
of total self-combustion at any
time.” A

“It remains to be seen if he’s
got the discipline and the ability
to sustain along-term campaign,
and it looks like this is going to
be a long-term campaign,” Licht-
man said. , .

Both Victor and Lichtman
recognized that Santorum has
little chance to take Florida or
the nomination, and that he is
“treading water.”

Regardless of who wins in Flor- _

ida, the victory will prove critical
moving forward. The state “isn’t

a game-ender,” Lichtman said.

“The beat‘ goes on, but obviously
it’s very, very important.” I

that more papers would be"
picked up than if they are lim-
ited to only students. He voted

on Tuesday to extend the pro-
gram, but he said he will vote to
wait until the campus re_ceives
the locked drop boxes.

I “If we implement right away,
it will be just like before,” Lou-
derback said. “Why wouldwe
go back'to that system?” I

‘injected mice found signiﬁcant relief

from many of the symptoms associ-
ated with aging. ‘
Mice affected by progeria live an

average life of 28 days, Neidemhofer ‘

said, as opposed to normal mice that
typically live between one-and—a—half
to two years. She and Huard" were
surprised to see that the mice were
living longer afterbeing injectedwith
the stem cells. 1

“At one point, I looked at the ani-
mals, and they were at 45 days.post—
implementation. I thought it was a
mistake,” Huard said.. “It seemed too
good to be true, but it wasn’t a ﬂuke.

That’s what was happening.”

Huard said the mice that received
stem cells lived approximately two to
three times as long as they should,
between 45 to 60 days.

The researchers are optimistic
that the results will have similar ben-
eﬁts and slow down the aging process
in humans.

“A lot of science needs to be done,
but maybe inthe next 10, 15, 20 years
we harvest your stem cells, we freeze
them down, and when you turn 45 or
50, instead of doing all this cosmetic
surgery, you re—infuse yourselfwith
your own stem cells to rejuvenate
yourself,” Huard said. _

Still, their research is far from a
personal time machine.

“We are not going to take some-

one who is 50 and make them look 25 8

again, but it’s possible to take some-
one who is 45, inject them with stem
cells from when they were 20 and try
to delay the aging process,” Huard
said.

The experiment operated under
several controls. The researchers
separated the mice into two groups:
those affected by progeria and those
who were healthy. Each group had
between four and nine mice. Those
with progeria were then divided into
two groups: one that was simply in-
jected with a saline solution and the
other that was given the MDSPCS in-
jection into each mouse’s abdominal
cavities.

Huard likened his research dis-
coveries to learning to play an in-
strument. “It’s like learning to play
the guitar. You learn your ﬁrst few

notes and think, ‘Man, I’m so good,’
but then you quickly realize how little
you know,” Huard said.

The next phase of his research
involved harvesting stem cells and
progeric cells and cultivating them

~ together to determine if a growth fac-

tor was secreted that “rescued” the
aging cells, allowing them to spread
and differentiate.

“If we can identify and purify that

factor, then we may have found an"

anti-aging protein or an anti-aging
factor that we can use in the drug
store without having stem cell con-
sultation,” Huard said.

- Huard also noted that the stem
cells caused the aging mice to develop
blood vessels in the brain and muscles
post—injection, which led his team to
believe the number of blood vessels

is related to the beneﬁcial effects and
production of stem cells.

Huard hopes to further pursue re-
search about the potential beneﬁcial
effects of stem cells. He and N iedem-
hofer are currently in the application
process for more research grants.

The National Institute of Health,
the Ellison Medical Foundation, the
Henry J. Mankin endowed chair at
Pitt and the Jean W. Donaldson en-
dowed chair at the Children’s Hospital
of Pittsburgh funded the project.

“I would like to project myself 50
years from now reading a science pa-
per coming out and see what those
cells are secreting because we are go-
ing to know, maybe in my lifetime.
The young generation is going to
say, ‘Oh my, those were the factors,”
Huard said. I

COLUMN

Internet facilitates

Courtney Strauss
Columnist

 

Like the “Saturday Night Live”
character Glenda Okones, who
created her own political smear
campaign to preempt the inevi-
table trash talk, welanticipate
criticisms of our actions before we
even complete them. In the words
of Taylor Swift, about whom I
don’t have anything nice to say so
I won’t say anything at all, “Why
you gotta be so mean?”

Of course, if we all heeded our
mother’s only-say-nice-things
mantra, art critics would be out of
a job and “Prom Night” would’ve
made way more money. We criti-
cize, some say, because we love.
For instance, people felt the need
to tear apart SNL musical guest
Lana Del Rey because they loved
music. But while she was a little
pitchy and lacked stage presence,
some attacks —- making fun of her
plump lips, for example — were
unnecessary.

What I’m concerned with isn’t
informed criticism, it’s meanness.
Petty name-calling has become
more prevalent than ever, part-
ly because we can hide behind
computer screens when we at-
tack people and partly because
we no longer understand what
nice means.

The Internet allows political

smears and middle—school bully— V

ing to spread on awhole new level.
In the political world, nasty online
rumors force candidates to take
time away from serious discus-
sions to debunk silly rumors. And
in schools, cyberbullying contin-
ues to engender tragedy (the one-
year mark of 15-year-old Phoebe
Prince’s suicide is fast approach-
ing). In a 2005 i-SAFE America
study that polled students in the

fourth through eighth grade, 57
percent reported that someone

had said hurtful or angry things

to them online. ‘

We most readily associate cy-
berbullyingwith preteens and
high school students, but it’s also
prevalent among adults. In the
January issue of “Elle,” a woman
using the pseudonym Totally
Helpless wrote to the magazine’s
advice column and complained
that photoshopped pictures of her
having sex with‘ animals popped
up whenever she Googled her
name. She suspects a woman at
a rival ﬁrm created the pictures
after losing an account to her, but
she has no way of knowing. The
anonymity the Internet affords
allows us to unleash that mean
streak we harbor inside us with-
out having to assign our names to
the dirty deed.

A As we grow older, cyberbully— A
ing will only become fancier and

the consequences more severe.
Consider What we already do:
Many of us end relationships by
defriending someone on Face-
book. This can be a real day—ruiner
when you hope a pal at odds with
you will listen to the slew of your
apology voicemails and ﬁnally
agree to meet you at Starbucks
for reconciliation over lattes.
Remedying our recent mean;
ness epidemic, however, might
be harder than tamping down
on cyberbullying, given that the
word “nice” has attained a dubi-
ous connotation. Some studies,
for instance, demonstrate that
when women are viewed as nice,
people like them better, but the
nice women are considered less
effective in the workplace. When
they’re considered more effective
but not as nice, however, they
experience more career road-

anonymous cruelty  

    What I’m
concerned
with isn’t
informed  
criticism,
it’s meanness.

 

 

 -pfbblem  pl.
ception here,” Huffington Post
columnist Birute‘Regine said.
“And the biases we bring to the
word ‘nice,’. such as being compli-
ant and eager to please.” Being
nice entails much more than this
stereotype. Regine uses the,anal-
ogy of a dancer: Talented danc-
ers make their performances look
easy, when, in fact, they require
immense skill and training. We
take for granted the skill needed
to make things nice.

Whether someone chooses to
hide behind technology in order
to avoid an uncomfortable situ-
ation or scour the cyber-ether
dealing out anonymous low blows,
meanness should be resisted at
all costs. If you’re guilty of one
of the aforementioned charges,
you’re only hurting yourself. Your
body would be much better off if
you released serotonin and endor-
phins by making the world a little
nicer. Remember, we’re all human
beings with feelings. I

"Paterno was looked up to by many

people for years. However,-I am

Practice players become part of team

Byjasper Wilson
I Sta_[fWri ter

When Gregg Donnelly takes the
ﬂoor at the Petersen Events Cen-
ter, he’s surrounded by athletes a
few inches taller and quite a few
pounds of muscle heavier. He’s
not allowed to dunk, but unless
he. makes a slick move inside, he
probably wouldn’t get the ball that
close to the basket, anyway.

But at the other end of the
court, Pitt women’s basketball
players usually have no trouble
scoring on him.

Donnelly is just one of the
male students who make up Pitt’s
group of practice players. Pitt head
coach Agnus Berenato started us-
ing practice players when she was
a head coach at Georgia Tech in
the ’90s and carried the tradition
with her to Pitt.

She ﬁrst started using male
practice players when her team
at Georgia Tech suffered several
injuries and a friend’s son gathered
some fraternity brothers to join
her team at practice.

“We had to have a scout team,”

V Berenato said. “We have to be able .

to practice against our opponent

The Panthers use male practice players to help them prepare and develop.

and see what they’re running.”
Tennessee head coach Pat
Summitt is creditedwith intro-
ducing the concept to women’s
basketball in 1974 when she be-
gan coaching there. Other top
programs —— such as Connecticut
and Rutgers —— also use male prac-
tice players.

Summitt said she started using

male pract-ice players because her
team didn’t have .a lot of depth and
it was difﬁcult to hold scrimmages
in practice.

While coaching, she also taught
physical education classes and
took classes as a graduate student.
She took notice of men playing
pickup games in the gym after her
practices and got the idea to ask

‘ some of them to play against the

Lady Volunteers.

“It was much better than our
manager waving a broom like she
was a tall player in the post trying
to block or alter shots,” Summitt
said.

Summit said the practice play-
ers help the team get more rep-
etition on offense and defense
while eliminating the familiarity
of always competing against team-
mates’. _

Practicing with the Panthers

. Bobby Mizia l Senior Staff itriter
Several women’s basketball programs, including Pitt, bring in male players to practice with the team.

Donnelly, now a senior, has
practiced with the Panthers since
his sophomore year. He went
through a tryout with a group of
other potential practice players
after responding to a ﬂier posted
in Trees Hall.

“I’m only 5—foot-10 and the girls
there are over six feet,” Donnelly
said. “You swallow your pride be-
cause they’re gonna drop step and
they’re gonna score on you.”

For the sake of competitiveness
and safety, Berenato has a set of
rules the practice players must
follow. They cannot dunk, block
from behind or undercut during
a layup.

Other male students discovered
the opportunity in a different way.
This year, video coordinator Dave
Scarborough went to Trees Hall
and played some pickup games to
ﬁnd potential practice players.

“I did it the wrong way. I got
guys’ emails and instead of saying,
‘Hey, let me get your email,”’ he
said. “Guys just emailed me and I
had no idea who they were.”

The ﬁrst player he brought to
the team was 5—foot-10 sophomore
Josh Smertz.

Pitt looks to keep

1.‘ .

momentum against Hoyas?

. By Nate Barnes
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s basketball team still
has a long way to go.

The Panthers picked up their
ﬁst Big East win on Wednesday,
but it won’t be easy for Pitt to coun-
ter an eight—game losing skid by
starting a win streak. Pitt will face
a signiﬁcantly more challenging
task against No. 10 Georgetown
tomorrow than it did in its win
over Providence.

Pitt (12—9, 1-7 Big East) must see
this game — and every game after
it — as a must-win situation. The
Panthers ﬁnally ended their losing
streak and have the chance to turn
the end of their season around, but
that can’t happen unless they pull
out a victory over the Hoyas (16-3,
6-2 Big East)

After the Providence ‘ game,
Pitt forward Nasir Robinson said
the Panthers have more winning
to do. To pick up a second win in
the Big East, Pitt will have to get
by the Hoyas and their big three:
Jason Clark, Hollis Thompson and
Henry Sims.

Clark — a high—scoring guard
— ﬁgures to give Pitt trouble. Clark
averages 15.9 points per game and
recently exploded for 31 points
against DePau1 onjan. 17.

Pitt has given up high—scoring
totals to many guards this sea-
son. Most recently, Providence’s
Vincent Council nearly posted a
triple—double with 26 points, 10
rebounds and nine assists. But
Council didn’t have much help
outside of his own scoring.

That’s not the case for the
Hoyas.

Thompson averages 14 points
per game. Although he scored just
four points onJan. 21 against Rut-
gers, he shoots 50.3 percent from
the 3-point line and has posted
multiple 20-plus point games this
season.

Pitt Panther Lamar Patterson
will most likely draw the assign-
ment of the junior small forward
Thompson, while Travon Woodall
will need to stay on his toes to de-
fend Clark.

Underneath, Pitt will need
to ﬁnd a way to counter George-

..;:«.,

town’s center, Sims. The 6—foot-10, Q
242—pound senior averages 11.8 1
points and 5.5 rebounds per game. V
The Panthers have struggled inside .
this season, both offensively and A

defensively.

Coming off a double—double i
against Rutgers, Sims will look to ;

assert himself against a smaller

Pitt frontline. Dixon will likely ro- S
tate Talib Zanna and Dante Taylor

on Sims defensively. .

Several factors will be in:§§tt’s _
favor tomorrow, starting with the ,

momentum that comes from a
long—awaited ﬁrst Big East win.
While Providence is hardly a Big

East powerhouse and is currently “

tied with Pitt for last in the Big East
standings, anything other than a
zero in the Big East win column
looks good to Pitt fans.

More importantly, during the a

game against Providence, the
Panthers actually looked theway
a Pitt basketball team is exprsﬁied
to look.

Although the Friars scored 74 it

points against Pitt, the Panthers’

offensive execution might have 
been thebest fans have seen all _

year.
Pitt also has its backcourt intact

for the ﬁrst time since the end of ,

November. Starting point guard
Woodall —— in his second game

back since suffering an abdomi— S

nal injury —— ﬁnally looked healthy
and made a noticeable impsﬁ.‘

The offense ran smoothly, f
and Woodall removed pressure 1
from Gibbs, which allowed the _V
Preseason Big East Player of the 
Year to shine. Woodall ﬁnished the 
game as Pitt’s second-leading,s,cor- 
er with 17 points and also di§hed 

out nine assists.

“It’s amazing [Woodall’s] back 

and playing to this level so quick- 1

ly,” Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon
said after the win over Providence.
“Eight weeks is eight weeks,‘ but
he was tremendous, and Ithought
his play spread. Hopefully it will
continue to spread when we get
back to work tomorrow.”

BIG EAST BREAKDOWN

Sracuse stays at top of some

By R] Sepich A‘
Staﬂ” Writer

After ﬁnally picking up its ﬁrst Big
Easf win on Wednesday, the Pitt
men’s basketball team no longer
sits at the bottom of my Big East
standings. _

The 12-point victory over
Providence snapped the Panthers’
eight-game losing streak, and
with starting point guard Travon
Woodall ﬁnally looking healthy,
Pitt might slowly climb the league
rankings in the coming weeks.

As the rest of the league con-
tiniggs to shuffle for positioning
in the Big East, here are my lat-
est rankings of all 16 teams in the
conference:

A 1. Syracuse — With sophomore
center Fab Melo out with academic
issues, the Orange (21-1, 8-1 Big
East) lost their ﬁrst game of the
season and their_No. 1 national
ranking at Notre Dame last Sat-
urday. However, Syracuse didn’t
dwell on the setback. Head coach
Jim Boeheim’s team rebounded
in1‘{z:32ssively with a strong vic-
tory on the road at Cincinnati on

Monday to show both the Big East
and the entire country that the
Orange remains one of the best
teams in the nation — with or
without Melo.

2. Georgetown — There’s
something to be said for a team
that can play awfully and still come
away with the win. That’s exactly
what the Hoyas (16—3, 6-2 Big
East) did this Saturday. George-
town shot a miserable 13 percent
in the ﬁrst half against Rutgers,
yet still found a way to pull out
a two—point victory against the
pesky Scarlet Knights. Starting
with Pitt this Saturday, the Hoyas’
schedule gets tougher and tougher
over the next few weeks.

3. Marquette — The Golden
Eagles (17-4, 6-2 Big East) are on
a ﬁve—game winning streak and
are ofﬁcially the hottest team in
the conference. Star senior guard
Darius Johnson-Odom is ﬁnally
getting the support he expected
when Marquette entered the sea-
son with high hopes after last sea-
son’s surprising run to the Sweet
16. If the Golden Eagles’ role-
players continue to play at a high
level, Marquette’s winning ways

January 27, 2012 I The Pitt News I WWW.pittnews.com

won’t end anytime soon.

4. Cincinnati — After taking
the No. 2 spot in my standings last
week, the Bearcats (15-6, 5-3 Big
East) dropped both games this
week after close, disappointing
losses against West Virginia and
Syracuse. On paper, Cincinnati
beneﬁts from an easier schedule

. in its next few games, but picking

up victories during road trips to
Rutgers and St. John’s is always
easier said than done in the al-
ways unpredictable Big East con-
ference.

5. Notre Dame — For a pro-
gram that has searched for a
breakthrough victory in recent
seasons, the Irish’s (13—8, 5-3 Big
East) win over N o. 1 Syracuse last
Saturday might be just that. Notre
Dame’s students rushed the court
after pulling off the biggest shock

this college basketball season, and .

the team managed to avoid a let-
down Wednesday night by pick-
ing up a nice road victory at Seton
Hall. The Irish found wins tough
to come by earlier this season, but
they seem to be gaining momen-
tum at just the right time.

6. West Virginia 9 Unlike

Notre Dame, the Mountaineers
(15—6, 5-3 Big East) did suffer a let-
down following one of their best
wins of the season. West Virginia
pulled out an overtimewin over
Cincinnati on Saturday, but didn’t
show up at all on Wednesday as
the Mountaineers were blown out
by St.John’s in New York. Playing
inconsistent basketball like the
Mountaineers have done this sea-
son isn’t a great recipe for success,
but with a star like Kevin Jones
on their roster, West Virginia will
always be dangerous.

7. Connecticut —— The Huskies
(14-5, 4-3 Big East) have struggled
to win close games this season
with last year’s late-game hero
Kemba Walker now playing in
the NBA. UConn recently dropped
tight affairs with Cincinnati and
Tennessee by three points each

and has now lost four of its last _

six after a 12-1, start. The talent is
still there, but the Huskies need
to start turning the corner soon
before they ﬁnd themselves on the
verge of missing out on the chance
to defend their NCAA title.

8. Louisville — Many people
expected Pitt to pick up its ﬁrst

rence, Pitt moves up a spot

Big East win Saturday night with
College GameDay in town to watch
the Panthers and Cardinals play.
Head coach Rick Pitino’s team,
however, had other plans. Lou-
isville (16-5, 4-4 Big East) came
into the Petersen Events Center
and took the crowd out of the
game down the stretch to pick up
a crucial win. Now back at .500
in conference play, Louisville will
hope the win over Pitt can jump-_
start its season. _

In the rest of the Big East,
South Florida (9) and Seton Hall
(10) continue to have pleasantly

surprising seasons. Both the Bulls '

and the Pirates have winning re-
cords in conference play almost
halfway through the season. Rut-
gers (11) and St. John’s (12) are
still trudging their way through
rebuilding years by picking up
wins when they can. DePaul (14)
won its second Big East game and
the Blue Demons have made big
strides in the right direction this
season. Finally, Pitt (15) ended its
losing streak, but it wasn’t much
of an achievement when you con-
sider that the victory came against
lowly Providence (16). I

PRACTICE PLAYERS

FROM PAGE 7

“He walked into my ofﬁce one
day, he’s like ﬁve-foot-nothing and
we were a little worried about him,”
Scarborough said. “He’s turned out
to br: :1 good guy.”

Smertz recruited new practice
player Zach Koehler. Senior Pat
McDonald heard about practice
players from friends who started
helping teams at other schools,
such as the University of Southern
Calﬁggrnia. Sophomorejarad Kmi-
etowicz saw a ﬂier about becoming
a practice player last year.

McDonald, who transferred
to Pitt last year from Wilkes Uni-
versity, took initiative and got the
process started as soon as he ar-
rived on campus.

He played soccer at Wilkes and
said that the camaraderie between
the basketball team members and

practice players reminds him of
his time as an intercollegiate ath-
lete.

“You kinda feel a part of every-
thing that’s going on,” he said. “So
it’s kinda cool to feel that again.”

Smertz said the experience
hasn’t been what he expected.

“I ﬁgured I would just go there
and maybe pick a few balls up
and put the balls away,” Smertz

said.

But Berenato uses practice
players to ensure that none of her
team members see less time on the
court during practice. She said she
wants her players on the bench to
get into the rotation the same way
they would in a game.

‘,‘Say you practice a scout, then
you have to teach and reteach the
whole set [to the entire bench],”
she said. “The thing is, it just takes
a lot of time. I try to be very, very
time conscious. For me, it’s all
about time management.”

Sophomore guard Marquel
Davis was already used to play-
ing with male athletes at practice
when she arrived at Pitt as a fresh-
man, saying she’d played against
men her entire life. 5

“I just look at it like playing
pickup against the guys in a regular
gym,” she said. “I think it’s good
for women players to be able to
get to play against men because
physically they have a bit [more]

percentage marks his highest percentage
since he went 4-8 on Dec.1O against Okla-
homa St.

“There is deﬁnitely more space. [Wood-
all] is an extra playmaker,” Gibbs said. “At
the same time he is a scoring option, too,
so the defense has to respect him. It opens
up opportunities for me. It’s great to have
him back. The best is yetto come from him
and his team.” ‘

Home-court advantage could also fac-
.tor into the game’s outcome. Despite some

inexcusable losses at home, such as Wagner .

and Long Beach State, Pitt should still gain
an.advantage from playing at the Petersen
Events Center this weekend instead of need-
ing to travel. '

Students get up for big games. Before this
season, the Petersen Events Center used to
be known as the place where top—1o teams
come to die. Maybe Pitt can salvage some of
that reputation.

“We have to hold our heads high now,
but we have to move on,” Gibbs said. “We
have to prepare for practice tomorrow to get
ready for Georgetown Saturday and carry
everything over.” I

of an advantage than women have. They
make us‘ better.”

Sophomore Kyra Dunn agreed that prac-_

ticing with men is normal. Her high school
team also used practice players. I
. “It’s just a tremendous help,” she said.

‘ “And it really makes you want to work that
‘ much harder because it teaches you to give

everything you’ve got to in order to dofwell
against girl or outplay her.

“I’m just so thankful that they come in
everyday even though the results don’t seem
like they’re paying off. It’s just a great help
and we really appreciate it.” '

The practice players receive a pair of
sneakers and practice gear that the team
washes and that they get to keep at the end
of the year. That’s the extent of the free

. perks.

But the players don’t do it for the tangible
beneﬁts- '

“Everyone really likes being apart of a
group,” Berenato said. “They really have
become a part of our family.” '

All practice players have to go through
the same administrative hurdles as the ath-
letes, including registering with NCAA clear-
inghouse, taking drug tests, undergoing
physicals, attending compliance meetings
and ﬁlling out paperwork.

“The process is long, but it’s thoroug ,”
Pitt associate head coach Patty Coyle said.
“If they go through the process, you know
they’re serious. They understand it’s not
about them. They all get it. That’s real im-
portant. They’re here to make us better.”

Beyond ‘Practice '

For some of the practice players, the ex-
perience helpsprepare them for the future.
Kmietowicz said he wants to go into coach-
ing and that his time as a practice player will
be invaluable as a coach.

“I just think that all the practice players 
start out just wanting to get a good run and

work up a good sweat,” Berenato said. “But .

what several of them have done is ask me
if they could come shadow us in the ofﬁce.
They all maybe now want to think about a
career in athletics.”

' Over time, the players become part of

the team.
“Greg brought his parents last week and

they came to a practice,” Berenato said. “It
was if they were watching their son practice
for a team.Jarad’s parents were at the West

Virginia game on Saturday. They’re just so '

proud of their sons.” .
Mallorie Winn, a former player under
Berenato at Pitt and Georgia Tech, is now
an assistant coach. She knows ﬁrsthand the
importance of practice players. -
“It’s becomes very tiring being a student-
athlete. Going to class, practice everyday,
weightlifting this and that,” Winn said. “To

have that different element come in and raise:

the intensity on a" daily basis, it just really
helps keep the practices spontaneous and
keep it going and keeping it competitive.
Scarborough said the practice players
help to recreate game-like situations and
Coyle added that ‘.‘they never have a bad
day.” _ A
The role of the men doesn’t stop when
practice ends.
7 fj‘jOne of the managers last year and I

would sit at press row [during games] and .

we would just ‘write the plays together and
defense and all that,” Kmietowicz said. “It
was just good to see the game from that
aspect. It was almost like we were scouting
with coaches.” 4 I

The men often break down ﬁlm with the
team, as well. ' ‘

With the -practice players’ different
schedules, two or three men will normally
take part in a practice. The coaches hope to
get to a point-where they have ﬁve at every

4 practice and a total roster of 10 or more.

Each of the practice players said they’ve
developed a greater appreciation for the
players’ ability and the sport.

“A lot of people are surprised with the lev-
el of competition,” Donnelly said. “I always

tell my buddies ‘No, they’re very skilled, very _

9”

strong and they’re quick too.
McDonald chuckled recalling a ‘misun-
derstanding about the role of practice play-

I ers. He overheard a conversation where a

fellow Pitt student thought McDonald snuck
onto the Petersen Events Center ﬂoor once
and took a shot. '

“I’m in there like everyday,” McDonald
said.

Smertz said it keeps getting harder for I

him to keep up with the team.

“What I’ve learned so far is that women’s
players are a lot better than people think.
It’s deﬁnitely been a humbling experience
playing against them,” Smertz said. i
