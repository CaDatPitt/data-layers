Peace Treaty
F Vote Scheduled

A referendum for the Peoples
Peace Treaty will be held Friday
in either the Cathedral Commons
Room or the Towers Lobby.

The announcement was made
Monday evening -by Dennis Con-
cilla, Programs Commissioner of
the Student Association.

DONATELLI: Referendum
unsatisfactory.
News Photo

The nine point document. which
calls for complete and total with-
drawal of American troops from
Vietnam, was approved at a stu-
dent peace conference in Ann Ar-
bor, Mich., in early February.

There has been disagreement
between Pitt’s Peace Treaty Com-
mittee and the Young Americans
for Freedom, who disapproves of
the committee’s tactics.

Simon Solomon. a spokesman
for Pitt's Peace Treaty Commit-
tee, said that approval of the ref-
erendum would be an added indi-
cation of the public‘s disenchant-
ment with the Indo-China conflict.

Frank Donatelli of the Young

Americans for Freedom (YAF).
voiced his dissatisfaction with
Fridays referendum. "I would
recommend that the Student As-
sociation not have a referendum
now since there hasn‘t been suf-
ficient publicity to inform the pub-
lic."

Solomon reported that the com-
mittee has been holding discus-
sions and been willing to answer
questions on the treaty for over a
month. Concilla says, however,

. that YAF requested a public de-
_ bate with the Peace Committee

and was refused.

When questioned about refusing
to debate the treaty. Solomon
stated. “We don‘t want to put our-
selves on their (YAF's> level.“

Donatelli fears that passage of
the referendum at Pitt “would
only give more ammunition. to the
movement. Students should be
aware of the reprecussions. he
said. "If colleges ratify the trea-
ty. the more violent the spring
demonstrations will be. "

Solomon pointed out that a re-
jection of the referendum would
not effect the May 5 offensive in
Washington. It will include non-
violent acts of civil disobedience.

“We're going to Washington to
increase the consciousness of the
people in the country and to sen-
sitize them to the fact that the
war is going on and what it's doing
to the country of Vietnam." Solo-
mon declared.

The ballots for Fridays refer-
endum will include the complete
text of the People's Peace Treaty.

Concilla emphasized that al-
though the Student Association
will be checking validated identi-
fications andin charge of tallying
the votes. "the outcome of the
referendum will not dictate the
policies of the Student Associa-
tion. It will merely illustrate the

feelings of those students who

voted." Concilla said.

College Presidents Unite

New Master Plan Proposed

by BOB BONN
Opinion Editor
The adoption of an equitable
Master’Plan for funding colleges
and universities in Pennsylvania
looks "very promising.“ accord.-
ing to Chancellor Wesley Posvar.

Previous fears that a Master
Plan would aid smaller. private
institutions and hurt Pitt. Penn
State, and other large universities
in the state have been alleged by
making serveral plans—one for
community colleges. one for state
colleges. and one for the three
state-related schools.

According to the Chancellor. the
Pennsylvania Association of Col-
leges and Universities (PACU) is
developing a system now for Pitt.
Penn State. and Temple.

The PACU is a body of 11 col-
lege presidents, including the
heads of Penn, Pitt, Villanova,
Temple, Chatham, a_ state college,
a community college, and several
others.

"The formula itself is very com-

complicated." the Chancellor said.

"but in brief. its based on unit
cost figures per output in credit-
hours ' I

In other words. funding will be
based on the number of credit-
hours earned at the school. Dif-
fering costs between upper-level
and lower level courses. as well
as graduate courses. will also be
taken in account.

Though this formula may tend
to increase class size, Posvar does
not expect this to be a major prob-
lem‘. “A danger in any formula is
the incentive to cut costs and in-
crease credit-hour output by hav-
ing larger classes,” he said.

"But I think we must reasonbly
and sensibly hold the line on class
size."

It was also pointed out that
some very small classes. which
receive only four or five students
a term. may be offered only once

RICHARD Utley and Albert Watts

drug analysis open to students.

“Seeing that it is nearly impos-
sible to dissuade students from
using drugs. we wanted users to
be fully aware of what they are
taking," said Bob Ging. Chairman
of the committee. "This is be-
cause most of the drugs used are
unavailable pharmaceutically and
the users will often purchase a
drug under false pretenses. This
creates an obvious health hazard."

To have a drug analyzed. a stu-
dent must Contact Ging through
the SA office at extension 7330.
After the samples are picked up.
they will be forwarded to the

them. The findings will then be re— ,

Confidential Drug Analysis

Gingrstressed that all of the
findings are confidential and the
user remains anonymous.

"Neither the LAC. nor the Cam-
pus Police condones the use of
drugs." cautioned Ging. "We just
can‘t stand by and watch people
harm themselves.

A The drug analysis program was

conceived at a meeting with In-

Approval of the plan by the State

while. A drafting team is present-

'Skyscraper’ Cuts $$ 

by JIM MAC .

The Executive Committee of the
School of Engineering has voted
unanimously to withdraw $2.400
in subscription money from the
Skyscraper Engineer.

The magazine will no longer be
available free of charge unless
new revenue sources are found.

Dr. Harold Hoelscher. Dean of
the School of Engineering. de-
clared that the withdrawal was
due primarily to “tight finances."

“We have been going through
the budget for the past months,”
he said, “and here and in other
places we have decided to cut
funds. We are also not hiring ad-
ditional staff next year nor are we
raising any faculty salaries.”

The Skyscraper Engineer gets
about one-half its operating ex-
penses from the Executive Com-

mittee. Dick Beswick, editor of"

the magazine. said that'he had “a
few alternatives“ to recoup the
funds.

"First." he said. “we can re-
quest that the Engineering Cabi-
net ask the Executive committee
to reconsider the withdrawal, or
we can try to get funds from the
alumni. If we don't get this. we
will have to charge 40 cents per
copy.“

Beswick predicted that charg-
ing students for the publication
would greatly reduce circulation.
“This would limit our effective-
ness,” he said. “We are now 21 vi-
tal source of communication with-
ing the Engineering School. A cut
in funds would weaken our cohe-
sive force and ultimately the st-

I dents’ education}?

The withdrawal of financial sup-

port coincides with what Beswick -

termed a “peace issue“ of the
Skyscraper Engineer, which some
viewed as critical of the School of
Engineering.

In a feature editorial in the M

Winter '71 issue. the editor wrote:
“To cease to be a leech on our,’
troubled city, I suggest that the
School of Engineering should les-

sen the rigor of its courses, lower ' L ‘

its admissions requirements, and
thus make possible the admission it
of. more center city high school-
graduates."

Hoelscher claims that there is 
no connection between this end
and other editorials and the cut in
funds. “There is, however," he
said, “great controversy among"
faculty and students alike on is-

_ suing school money to purchase a

magazine that not everyone feels
is worth reading. Because of this
and tight funds, we have decided
to withdraw subscriptions.“

RATES ON 65 parking meters in Schnley Plala have been doubled to
20 cents an hour, according to the Commuter Association (CA).

The hike, discovered Friday by the CA, encompassed approximately
half the meters in the region between Hillman and Carnegie Libraries.

Terming the action “a sad commentary on the state of parking in
Oakland,” the CA,said, “Few can afford this doubling of rates.

According to city officials, the hike was ordained by the Pittsburgh
Traffic Control Commission and the City Treasurer. The official claimed
. more money is needed to cover increases in wages and upkeep costs.
In a written statement, the CA urged commuters to express their out-
rage at the raise: “You, the commuters, are going to. pay this increase.
Why not join us in trying to do something about it? '

CA Refuses Terms‘

 

Lot ‘Opening Stalled

'byBOBGEDEKOH
Hopes to reopen the Panther

Hollow parking lot suffered an-

other setback Monday when the
Commuter Association (CA)
Parking Committee Chairman
Larry Elder refused to accept the
terms offered by University
Treasurer David Smith.

The agreement would have
placed the operation of the lot in
the hands of the CA. The Univer-
sity agreed to subsidize the lots
operation for one year. provided
the CA would operate the lot on a
self-supporting basis thereafter.

The lease and insurance for
three terms was to be $2.000. with
an additional $1.200 to be paid to
the Physical Plant for signs and
slag.

Elder claims that most students
do not attend classes during the
spring trimester, making the op-
eration of the lot during this per-
iod impractical.

"If the CA could fill the 70

spaces for two terms. only $1.400 I

could be raised. dooming the
project from the start." he said.

He added that he had never re-
ceived the conditions of the
agreement from Smith, but had
discovered the terms when Exe-
cutive Assistant to the Vice Chan-
cellor Dan McFadden showed him
a letter from Smith.

Elder said that if McFadden
had not shown him the letter,
“The CA might have wound up
with a lot under conditions they
could not possibly have met.”

Although the CA refused this
offer, it is‘ willing to consider

others. provided the University
accepts the financial responsibil-
ity of operating the lot. with the
CA accepting the responsibility

_ of' space allocation.

B&O POLICY

The Panther Hollow lot. owned
by the B&O Railroad. was for-
merly used by students free of
charge. In September of 1969. the
University received a lease from
B&O for the property. The prop-
erty was to be designated a stu-
dent parking area.

Although the amount asked by
the B&O was low. they requested
that the University accept the
liability for any incidents which
might occur on the property. The
University was unable to con-
tract an insurance policy and the
project was dropped.

Early this term, the railroad
notified the CA of its intention to
start tagging 4 and towing cars
parked in the lot, because the Uni-
versity had not signed the lease.

Since that time. Smith and the
B&O have negotiated in an at-
tempt to contract a new lease.

Elder claims that Smith said
last year the lot would be avail-
able free of charge because it was
too small to warrant the hiring of
an operator and because the B&O

A had made a very liberal offer.

Elder continued. “Why this sud-
den change of plan? Could it not
be that Mr. Smith fully realizes
that the CA couldn't comply with
the demands regarding the oper-
ation of the lot,, and he is hoping
that we will undertake it and
fail. giving him an excuse for re-

Any women students who have experienced discrim-
inating treatment at the Student Health Service, Placement
Center, or Counseling Center are URGED to send a short,
but detailed, written account of their experiences to Gail
Hornstein, Chairwoman Task Force on Student Affairs, Ad-
visory Council on _Women’s Opportunities, in 9I7 C.L. The
concrete accounts of women students are ESSENTIAL in our
examination of these services. All information will be kept
strictly confidential, but names may be withheld if the
writer feels that this is necessary.

_ fusing to offer future parking to
commuters?"
KATSUR LOT
Elder added. “If this project
doesn‘t work. the University
won’t lease the John Katsur lot to
the CA."

The CA wants to operate the
Katsur lot, on the corner of Daw-
son and Bouquet Streets. The lot
is University-owned but leased to
an individual. under the stipula-
tion that parking be made avail-
able to students at a charge of
$7 per month.

The CA contends that if Katsur
can make a profit, the University
could do as well, cycling the prof-
its into lot improvement and the
opening of other student parking
areas.

Replying to Elder. Smith said
the memo to McFadden was only
a restatement -of the agreement
which had previously been made
between himself and the CA. He
notedthat the lease and the mon-
ey have already been sent to the
B&O, and that the University will
control the land as soon as the
signed lease is returned.

He added that as soon as the
agreement is made about the Pan-
ther Hollow Lot, it will be avail-
able to students. He said the ad-
ministration is willing to meet
with the CA to discuss a new plan
for the 1ot’s operation, adding that
if repairs to the lot are to be
‘made, the students will have to
pay for them.

He noted that at the time a free
lot was proposed, there had been
no mention of needed repairs. “If
the lot is not taken over by the CA,
it will probably be turned over to
the Physical Plant for operation
‘on the basis of the other student
lot located near the Carnegie Mu-
seum,” he said.

Gray Denounces
«Black Gemcidé’ 1 Budget Hearings Slated

by LORETTA HORRELL
White Americans professing
black genocide say. “The only way
to get Niggers is before they are
born."

This was the view of Naomi

.Thomas Gray, specialist in the

field of family planning. She spoke
on “Population Control—a Form
of Black Genocide" Monday eve-
ning in the Graduate School of
Public Health auditorium

 

GRAY: Charges genocide.

Questioning the white concern
for environmental issues, such as
the need for fresh air and wide
open spaces. Gray stressed that
“blacks have not yet breathed
fresh air."

“The question of who is going to
survive is raised when population
control issues arise,” stated
Gray. Citing the Federal govern-
men’t present means of estab-
lishing more birth control facil-
ities in poor black communities
than in similar white areas, Gray
concluded that whites want only
whites to survive.

Gray explained that blacks are
concerned about the earth. but
that issues of self-determination
are presently more important.

"Black mothers and fathers do
give their children hope that the
existing system will be better."
remarked Gray. She said that in-
terest in family planning existed
in many black families.

“Well-to-do blacks average
smaller families than do whites
of the same income bracket,” she
said.

Of major concern to Gray is the
limitation of births in the lower in-
come brackets. “Consider birth
control facilities in a black com-
munity where no other medical
facilities exist.“ Gray argued.
"Whites are more concerned
about control of black births than
they are of healthy Americans."

Citing several cases of what
she considered racist attitudes.
Gray emphasized white actions
taken to procure what she labeled
black genocide. Among these were
the following:

—Legislation for sterilization of
welfare mothers made by South-
ern states.

—Coercive sterilization induced
on black mothers during deliv-
ery time in Southern hospitals.

—Attempts made by the Federal
government to limit the num-
ber of children for which sup-
port could be recieved.

Gray said that United States
foreign aid to non-white nations
in the form of birth control ma-
terials gives strength to genocide.

"The charge of genocide will
persist," stated Gray, “as long as
whites continue to talk out of
both sides of their mouths.

“Blacks want to be left alone.
They don’t want birth control de-
vices thrown at them. They are
tired of being dragged behind the
whites.

“Black women do want to lim-
it the size of their families." said
Gray, “but without white coer-
cion.“

Pitt’s Request Up

‘Budget hearings in Harrisburg.

Vice-Chancellor of Finance Edi-

As far as fiscal year 1971-72 is
concerned, Pitt is asking for $49.7

are added, the total amounts to

eer can do his part to change
the way things are.

Guns and bullets are designed

- ‘by’ engineers. If engineers would
 refuse to fabricate weapons, the
» Vyfoot soldier could not use them.
“As human beings, our conscience

should stop us from using our
skills to destroy life when we

- could be saving it.

The engineer, Conley‘s column
further points out, is an a1l-impor-
tant and powerful entity in to-
day’s technological society. Much

of America's wealth and capa-
bilities either directly or indirect-
ly fall under his control.

Now suppose you were Dean of
the School of Engineering. Would
you ‘want this issue of “Sky-
scraper Engineer” sent to your
executive friends in industry and
education?

By cutting off publication funds
and forcing the magazine tosell
at 40 cents an issue, Hoelscher
is preventing its free distribution.

The editor of Skyscraper En-
gineer feels that to make the
school more than a trade school.
an independent journal is essen-
tial. Skyscraper is the most wide-
ly-read student publication in the
School of Engineering, and cer-
tainly. the magazine is not the
least important engineering ac-
tivity. In fact, I feel that it is
one of the most important.

Why just now did the Execu-
tive Committee decide that its
funds were inadequate to sup-
port “Skyscraper,” and how
was it determined that funds for
the magazine were least essen-
tial? If the students do not feel
that the magazine warrants the
$2400 grant, as Hoelscher specu-
lates they may, then let their
elected representatives——the Stu-
dent Cabinet~—say so.

If the purpose of Dean Hoel-
scher‘s non-fiscal support is fi-
nancial censorship. he is acting
irresponsibly and unwisely. If
this is his purpose in cutting off
funds. the Dean is interfering
with the journalistic and academic

freedom of the engineering stu- '

dentbody.

 

Sexism Colorblind

Is Liberation Shared?

by MIKE SIMON

Recently. the Pitt News came out against the
Circle K. Miniest Mini Contest as sexist oriented
and degrading to women. Being in full agreement
with this stand. I was quite angered to note that
Black social fraternity. Alpha Phi Alpha. was
sponsoring a Hot Pants Contest, with a $10 prize
going to the nicest pair of Hot Pants. Adding to
my anger was the fact that this dance was to be
held the evening after the Circle K fiasco.

Before I jumped right in and branded the
Hot Pants Contest as sexist. I felt it would be ad-
visable to see what some black women and men
felt about the issue.

Their sentiments seem to dictate that Black
women have always been liberated. They held
the jobs to support the family.,and were always
depicted as “queens. beautiful. strong and inde-
pendent." Black women in ancient society had po-
litical and social equality. I

In short, white women’s liberation is not need-
ed for them. The overall freedom from oppression
for the black person is what matters.

The Black woman cannot be liberated until
the Black male is. Black women have enjoyed a

higher status over males in society for 100 years.

Unfortunately. I cannot agree with these sen-
timents. True. the black woman has supported the
black family in the ghetto. but in what type of
position? -.

She has been the cleaning woman, the maid or
practically anything else that could be consider-
ed degrading if not slavery. Bound to a low-pay-

ing job because of a second rate education. and.

a host of other reasons. she and her husband have
found it necessary to work for the wealthy whites.

Has she truly been regarded as a queen through-
out history or has she been manipulated by males
into taking the burden of raising a family?

I don‘t understand how the black women suc-
ceeded where the white woman failed.

Didn’t the Hot Pants Contest try to show the 

nicest body along with the clothes, or could some-
one have won it by putting a pair of hot pants
on a clothes hanger, and judge it by its style?

It's hard for blacks and whites to understand
and to communicate when they‘ve been apart
for so long. Maybe it’s time for a little less rhet-
oric. and we could try to be more understanding
witheach other.

 

.igWh0 Can We Trust? Whoi Are ‘The People’?

by MIKE SIMON

Prevalent in the United States today
are many misconceptions concerning the
People’s Peace Treaty and misinformation
about the entire Vietnam war.

Primarily, the treaty is not anti-Ameri-

can, it provides for both the immediate

withdrawal of United States forces from
Vietnam, as well as all other foreign
troops. This is stated very clearly in Ar-
ticle VI of the Treaty, “The Vietnamese
pledge‘ to form a provisional coalition
government to organize democratic elec-

- tions.

p All parties agree to respect the results
of elections in which all South Vietnamese

,,'can participate freely, without the pre-
sence of any foreign troops."

This in-
cludes North Vietnamese soldiers.
Accusations have also been made that
Article VII of the Treaty will allow a
bloodbath to occur. Article VII plainly
states, “The South Vietnamese pledge to
enter discussion of procedures to guaran-
tee the safety and political freedom of
those South Vietnamese who have colla-
borated with the United States or the U.

I S. supported regime.“

Perhaps the only reason people have
been so afraid of this provision is due to
the inconsistencies of the United States.
On numerous occasions, such as My Lai,
rampant slaughters have taken place
without any real reason.

If we can’t even trust our own coun-

A A 1“ try, just who can we trust?

The history of Vietnam is chock full
of repression and subversion sponsored
by the United States. In the 1954 Gene-
va Convention. South Vietnam and France

gagreed to allow Vietnam to hold free

elections.

It was the United States who backed
Diem, a pro-United States candidate. and
then finally caused the scheduled elec-
tions not to be held in 1956. Then, once

.. again, the guerilla warfare started and
K the killing was resumed. »

Accusations have also been made“

that the Treaty does not adhere to the
democratic principles of the country
The present United States regime does
not even respond to the democratic prin-
ciples of the country.

A citizen cannot expect the govern-
ment to respond to his or her demands
when that government has been proven
to have engaged in very undemocratic
actions.

When the will of a few bureaucrats,
can cause a country to suffer not only
politically,but socially and economically
as well, it is time for the people to make
the peace. This is the entire basis for the
Treaty’s justification.

It has been proven with the excur-
sion into Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.
that the United States Army, and the
U.S.-supported Army of the Republic of
Vietnam cannot defeat the North Viet-
namese.

This is not because the North Viet-
namese have a superior army, but is
attributed to the obvious conclusion that
the forces of the North must have the
support of the people. Without this they
couldn’t win, as they are doing right now.

Perhaps all of the people that make
up this country should take another look
at the treaty and see if it really isnt
what they have wanted. because Nixon
has shown time and time again that he
just isn't interested in ending the war.

by BARBARA SARGENT
Associate Professor of French

It is time to take a hard look at the so-
called “Peoples Peace Treaty." which
is being so enthusiastically pushed by
some students at this University.

-We are given to understand that they
are the “people" of the United States
and the “people“ of Viet Nam. Both in
point of fact the signers of this treaty
for the American side are 16 persons de-
signated by the National Student Associ-
ation and claiming to speak for the Ameri-
ican people (though the N.S.A. has
among its affiliate memberships less than
25 percent of colleges and universities in
this country).

On the other side are the communist
party of North Viet Nam and its student
fronts—subjects of a totalitarian regime
who could not sign this or any other
declaration without the approval of their
government.

For individual citizens in a free soci-
ety to enter negotiations with a repres-
sive regime that does not tolerate oppo-
sition and that responds to dissent with
annihialation (the collectivization pro-

gram of 1952-54 took a toll of some 600.-
000 human beings. from peasants to in-
tellectuals. in assassinations. forced labor.
and imprisonment) and commits armed
aggression against its neighbors goes be-
yond stupidity: it is downright wicked.

flow will you   Vote?

Article I, for example, promises im-
mediate and total withdrawal of Ameri-
can forces from Viet Nam and the pub-
lic announcement of a date by which
this withdrawal will be accomplished-
with not a word about reciprocal with-
drawal on the part of North Vietnamese
forces from the soverign states of Laos,

Cambodia, and South Viet Nam, where

they have been carrying on a war of
conquest for many years.

Article V states, with sickening hy-
pocrisy, that “the Americans pledge to
end the imposition of Thieu-Ky-Khiem
on the people of South Viet Nam in
order to insure their 1-ighto se1f-dete1--
mination and so that all political pris-
oners can be released.”

I In fact. the government of the South,
rather than that of the North, represents
the choice of the people, expressed by
vote in competitive elections attended by
international observers.

It is the totalitarian North, where com-
petitive elections are unknown. that daily
violates the right of its own people to

self-determination, and that can infallibly P

be counted upon to deny that right to
all inhabitants of territory it conquers.

Article VII, which blandlygpromises
that there will be “discussions of pro-
cedures” to guarantee the safety of those
suspected of collaborating with the U.S.
or the elected government of the South,
disregards the executions that the Viet
Cong has already carried out of thou-
sands of South Vietnamese, and the cap-
ture of numerous “blood lists” of those
tobe executed. .

Of course we want peace. But I sub-
mit that a satisfactory peace cannot be ob-
tained by naive amateurs conducting an
unofficial and indeed seditious flirtation

Treaty is coming up on Friday.

with the government of North Viet Nam
and representatives of the Viet Cong.

To claim that these are “the people of
Viet Nam“ is patent nonsense; the peo-
ple of those parts of the Far East (and
elsewhere) dominated by communist re-
gimes do nothave a voice in policy.

Apathy Triumphs

Learning absolutely nothing fromipast experience. the Pitt News
attempted early in March to woo the student body.

Courting earnestly, we mailed out questionnaires on the paper's
quality to a random sample of over 1.200 students. Anxious to serve
students, we hoped to gauge perceptions of the Pitt News’ strengths
and foibles—and then improve.

To our dismay, we were swamped by fewer than 100 responses—a
gratifying percentage compared to the turnout for Student Govern-
ment elections of late, but not enough for a valid survey.

Clutching at a straw, we are trying nonetheless to
tern.

The majority of respondents consider the Pitt News a "good"
newspaper——-as opposed to poor, fair, or excellent.

Naturally, we find this encouraging, although we hope to merit an
“excellent” rating before long. it

According to two-thirds, the Pitt [News has been “moderately
fair” over the past five months. Fourteen per cent consider the paper
“very fair.” Of this. we are proud. »

On the other hand, we are chastened by the fact that nearly two-

discern a pat-

thirds of those responding feel their field of study has not been ade-

quately covered. To correct this. we are focusing more on education.

Without more feedback,’ we will pursue the course we have al-
ready charted.

‘ Editor.

As a student and an economics
major at Pitt. I am concerned
about the quality of education I
am receiving. And frankly, I think
it leaves much to be desired. 1

The fault lies not only with the
student for passively accepting
what he or she is receiving, but
also and mostly with the various
departments who hire their fac-
ulty. Since I.am most familiar
with the workings of the depart-
ment of economics, I will direct
my disgust at them.

Recently, an assistant ‘profes-
sor in the department, James T.
Kneafsey, has been dismissed

, this year for some very shady

reasons. Those who are acquaint-
ed with him know~th’at he is one of
the few people in the department
who is seriously concerned about
the students and willing to help
them. ‘

Knowing this, I inquired why
his contract was not renewed.
The answers I received were var-
ious but none of them justify his
dismissal. Looking further into
the matter and listening to stu-
dents and faculty grievances, I
have come to the conclusion obvi-
ous to most in the department
that Prof. Kneafsey’s dismissal
and most of the department’s
problems are in some way affect-
ed by the game of power politics
being played among the faculty.

For some mystifying reason,
these “educated, enlightened"
scholars of economics cannot dis-
pel their petty jealousies and con-

tant — the student. Of course,
there are those in the department

Hiring Procedure Questioned"; 

who are concerned about the edu-
cation the students are receiving
and their welfare, but these are in
the minority and some may‘ also

-find themselves in a similar plight
_ as Prof. Kneafisey’s in the future.

(Next year, one of the best
teachers in the department will
be in a very precarious position
when his contract comes up for
renewal. The reason? He has fail-
edto obtain a Ph.D.)

Professors are-hired and dis-
missed on the basis of what the
power “clique” considers is the
person’s potential for fitting into
the social atmosphere of the de-
partment and on the length of his
or her credentials. —

His ability to communicate ef- .

fectively with and teach the stu-
dents is not considered.

A doctorate in economics and a
long list of publications does not
make a person a top—rate educa-
tor. When re-evaluating a present
professor on his past perform-
ance, teaching has a weight of
only 25 per cent.

Many of our distinguished doc-
tors in the department fail miser-
ably when it comes to teaching

yr

students. A handful of professors

Unfortunately, because of the is

department’s noble requirement ’
and goal that all professors hoid

doctorate degrees, we will be los-it .

ing some of our best teachers. We 

have already lost one.

As students, we are being 3
grossly neglected. Due to these 
occurrences in the department or;
economics, it appears that stu- 

dents are the lowest priority.  

It is time for students to.

educators and heads of wdepart- '
ments to think of morethan their g '\

The Abortion: An Historical Romance, 7966,
by Richard Brautigan, Simon and Schuster,

New York, $1.95.

Before he emerged from the San
Francisco underground. Richard
Brautigan was married and di-
vorced. never went to college.
reached the age of 29. and used to
make money selling his mimeo-
graphed poems on street corners.
He had written all of his presently
published books except one. be-
sides.

Times have changed. Having
been “discovered" by the above-
ground press. Brautigan has be-
come the most published unpub-
lished author of all time.

The Abortion: An Historical
Romance 1966 is being pre-
sented as the “new” novel by
Richard Brautigan and it repre-
sents a reviewer’s and reader’s
trap. The story goes like this:
somewhere on‘ the California
coast, probably Berkeley, there
lives a shy, isolated man who
runs a library where books that
are written and then stored for
eternity are brought and then
never seen again.

These books are all one-shot
affairs and, the writers are given

the distinct pleasure of placing
the book anywhere in the library
that they please.

LIBRARIAN

This loner—librarian has an as-
sistant. Foster. who takes these
books up to the “caves" where he
watches over them while he sits
around and hits the bottle. The li-
brarian. meanwhile. meets a girl
who hates her body. and then de-
cides that she ought to share a lit-
tle of it with this kind soul who
runs this book mausoleum. so she
moves in with him. and in a short
time. 10 and behold. she’s preg-
nant.

Good old Foster knows an abor-
tionist in Mexico, so he sends the
book undertaker and his girl,
Vida, down to this abortionist.
When they return, they discover
that Foster, in all his alcoholic’s
wisdom, has given over there-
sponsibility to a dear old lady,
who promptly throws them out.
We leave the story with our hero
selling things and collecting mon-
ey.

Some of the books brought to
the library, incidentally have ti-
tles like Its the Queen of Dark-
ness, Pal by Rod Keen, My Dog by
Bill Lewis. Sam, Sam, Sam by

Patricia Evens Summers and
Moose by Richard Brautigan.
When this last book is brought the
librarians remembers something
about the writer's last book which
had the word America in its title.
PARABLE

Brautigan mentioning Brauti-
gan in his own books seems to
suggest that this is not a first

/6’zmk
Kc:/[cw

novel. but something written in
the interim between the time he
wrote Trout Fishing in America
and when it got published. The

story seems to be a parable. a.

coming of age. where Brautigan
is ready to throw the artistst
creed of “art for arts sake“ to
the wind and go around taking
charity.

If we stretch the parable fur-
ther and look at the title. Brau-
tigan may not only have written
on abortion. but he may have writ-
ten an abortion. an intentional
self-parody to let out a little frus-

Brautigan’s “Abortion”: Not Up To Par

tration at not gaining any recogni-
tion. He may have written The
Abortion to while away the tim
or something. —

At any rate, he didn’t write it
very well (this may be sacreligi-
ous to Brautigan admirers) but
as a Brautigan admirer my self,
and knowing what he can and has
done with his other novels, it is
obvious to me that he didn’t spend
very much time with it, or put too
much into it. .

This may be a lot of speculation
but compared at his other finely
and tightly written books. Abor-
tion looks like an imitation. For
example:

"Vida had gone back to sleep.
She looked nice with her long
black hair spread out like a fan of
dark lakes upon the pillow" The
Abortion.

“We made a long and slow love.
A wind came up and the windows
trembled slightly, the sugar sway-
ed fragily by the wind. I liked
Pauline’s body and she said that
she liked mine too, and we could-
n’t think of anything to say.”

The second quote was from In
Watermelon Sugar and doesn‘t
tell you much other than exactly
what Brautigan wants to tell you.
but he doesn’t state it. he implys

/it. There lies the difference be-

tween this new book and the
others. The old ones are a esthet-
ic finery, the new one is well. The
Abortion.

NOT BEST

Abortion will seem like a ro-
mantic interlude from his other
works. or it will be considered as
not one of his best. My guess is
that he had a few bills to pay and
needed the income from another

book. or that he was cajoled into‘

printing it because he wanted to
change publishers. which he did.

In any case. putting the typical
fast paced and curious quirks of
a typical Brautigan story aside.
Abortion is not one of his first-

rate pieces of writing and should- .

n't be considered so merely out
of respect for an ideal or philoso-
phy.

Brautigan writes like a turned-
on Hemingway, not stating much
but creating, with words having
feeling, something that can’t real-
ly be described. He has taken the
responsibility to show us things
that we can feel rather than allow-
ing us the responsibility of free
interpretations. He has shown a
great maturity in his past writ-

tings, an artistic maturity tha

isn’t often found anymore. I

The Abortion is still nice but
that dangerous boundary between
good writing. using weird images.
and ludicrous writings that can't
be taken too seriously has been
crossed too many times. The
whole thing becomes a subtle. un-
knowing parody, but a nice parody
all the same. Even when he isn't
as good as he can be. Richard
Brautigan is still worth reading.

gRhodes, a Harvard fellow who

noted early that he usually com-

For the occasion, however. he
chose a light, simple, and optim-

Recalling the origins of “the

With -a raconteur's self-assur-
ance, Rhodes described a turning
point in his life—his realization of
the importance of “preserving hu-
man life.“

As a Cal Tech sophomore.
Rhodes recalled, he was a “mili-
tant black revolutionary . _. . in the
evenings.” He armed himself
then with an M-1 carbine, which
he was tempted to use when a riot
erupted in Pasadena.

Contemplating the possibility
of killing people, Rhodes suddenly
considered the thought “bizarre

and beyond reason.”

At that moment. Rhodes decided ,

"the preservation of human life“
is precious and got rid of his
weapon.

The culmination of twenty
days of spring football drills
comes this Saturday afternoon
as the gridders engage in the
annual intra-squad Blue-Gold
Game at the Stadium at 1:30.

Admission to the game is free
for everyone. Entrance to the

stands can be gained through
either Gate 1 or Gate 9.

This will be‘ the first time

The exact format of the con-
test will not be decided until the
end of this week. Coach Carl

Mitters Face Dukes
As ’71 Season Opens

by JANICE BUCCIGROSSI

Friday marks the opening of the ‘71 Pitt baseball season as the
mitters play at Duquesne’s Herchel Field at 2:30 p.m.

Pitt‘s coach. Bobby Lewis, will be going with a young and inex-
perienced squad. Three veteran starters—Guy Caparelli, Ken Macha,
and Terry Stokes—are returning to the line-up and only one senior
squad member, John Fredland, is elated to start.

Senior team captain. Bob Solonickne. who ended last year with a
.354 batting average,. will not be available to play right field in the
season opener. Solonickne broke: his hand several months ago and

still finds it difficult to swing a bat.

“Solonickne just won’t be able
to start on Friday,” related
Coach-Lewis. “He hasn’t respond-
ed to practice as we had hoped.”

Because of Solonickne‘s in-
ability to start, Lewis finds it
“necessary to place Ken Macha
in left field.“ Macha was origin-
ally to have played in the infield,
at either first or third base.

John Fredland holds down the
center field spot while Dennis
Toboz. who saw limited action
last season, rounds out the out-
field in right field.

Footballer John Simpson, in
his first season of Pitt baseball,
will start at first base. U‘

Lewis has positioned sopho-
more Bob Livingston and Paul
Quarantillo at second and third
base. respectively. Completing
the infield is last years center
fielder. Terry Stokes. who will
fill shortstop.

Behind the" plate is the vet-
eran sophomore. Guy Capar-
elli who handled most of the
catching last season.

Lewis is uncertain as to who

r’:

\

will be the starting pitcher in
the season opener.

“We haven't had enough out-
side work." explained Lewis.
“so I wouldn‘t go with just one
pitcher on Friday. Maybe I'll

I use there pitchers, each one only

to go a few innings."

Duquesne‘s coach, Rich Spear.
will also be fielding a young
team. The Duke starting line-up
consists mostly of sophomores.
Only three, three year men are
returning to the line-up. Pete
Rondinaro. out last season with
mononucleosis. will play first-
base while Jim Cafaro is in
left field and Tim Bradley is in
right.

Spear’s starting pitcher iwill
be either Paul Hindes or Ed
Fritsky.

"Pitching is our weak spot."
said Spear. "It’s not that we
don't have quality. we just don‘t
have quantity.

“There is little depth in
pitching right now. At this point
we have only four startingpitch-'
ers«an_d two relievers." »

The tennis team, which prov-
ed to Coach Fran Webster to be
stronger than anticipated will
play their season opener today
at two o'clock against the
Mountaineers of West Virginia
University. weather permitting.

"We‘ve got a few practices
in with the good weather and I
had a few surprises," stated Web-
ster. “A couple of boys I hadn’t
seen much of played some good
tennis at practice. Now I have a
good idea who will be playing
what.“

Today‘s line-up will feature
the following players. Sopho-
mores and lettermen. Joel Hur-
witz and Mike O’Laughlin will
be in the number one and two
singles positions and will team
up to form the number one
doubles squad.

Gary Schwartz, a junior trans-
fer student from Allegheny Com-
munity College will play num-
ber three singles and double
up with freshman Mike Pines,
who’s in the number four posi-

 

DePasqua and the coaching staff
will opt between two plans de-
pending on the number of injur-'
ed players -available for the
game. L

“If five or six players are
ready toigo full blast," explain-
ed -Defensive Coach Serafino
Fazio, “we'll be able to combine
the first team offense and second
defense against the second of-
fense and first defense.

“We’1l run it as a regular game
except for on punts when there
will just be fair catches," he
continued.

If the‘ few players aren’t pre-
pared to play, the style will be
similar to last year’s contest. Both

‘first strings will oppose the sec-

ond strings, and one team will
move the ball from the_ point
where the other team stalled.

“We‘d rather run it the first
way,” commented Fazio.

With the departure of kicking
specialist Joe Spicko due to grad-
uation, three candidates are vying
for the job. Tim Hornish will
fill the void at the punting spot,
while Eric Knisely and Bob Di-
Tommaso are battling for the
place-kicking position.

"Joel and Mike have played
doubles together before and have
good experience." Webster ex-
plained. “However, I‘m not sure
who my third doubles team will
be. It's hard to get two boys to
work together well for thefirst
time.“

Veterans Jorge Gutierrez and
Les Abramovitz hold the num-
ber five and six places on the
squad and newcomers Bill Wood,
Wesley Yang, Jonathan Flint and
Edwin Klein fill the number
seven. eight. nine and ten slots.

Webster indicated that the
positions especially the doubles
spots could change during, the

  
  

“They haven’t kicked under
fire," stated Fazio, “but they

_ have looked good so far."

There will be a change in the
Panther’s basic allignment on
defense. Instead of employing
the usual four man front line,
a middle guard will be added
and only two linebackers will
be necessary.

“The reason. why we changed
is because of the personnel re-
turning this year and the type
of boys that were just recruit-
ed,” explained Fazio. “We feel
that we’ll be able to use more
of the boys better this way."

Several gridders will sit out
the game due to injuries. Nick
Staresinic, John Thissen, Joel
Klimek, Mark Butryn. George
Boyerinas, and Gary Patterson
will all view the game from the
sideline.

Fazio is pleased with the pro-
gress made in the drills and feels
that the attitude on the squad is
good. “They are all eager and
hustling,” he said, “and they re-
alize that next year’s schedule
will be a lot tougher."

PAUL FELINCZAK (47) is stopped by the Panther defense led by

George Fehet (51) in last

Saturday's

scrimmage. Felinczak, a

freshman fullback, will get another crack this Saturday afternoon in

. the Blue-Gold game’. .

“Bad breaks like goals being
scored by our own men, bad offi-
ciating and excellent goaltending
by Fred Smith, Jr. cost us the
game," commented a bitter Joe
Testa on the Pitt hockey teams
8-5 loss to South Park. The loss
evened the team’s record at 3-3-1.

The game was delayed 30 min-
utes after two goals triggered off
long arguments. The first fracas
broke loose when Pitt’s‘ Dave
Bahnson was shoved into the
South Park net with the puck. The
referee allowed the goal but South
Park argued that it was an illegal
score. South Park lost the argu-
ment and had defenseman Dick
Rectenwald a misconduct penal-
ty, along with a team bench pen-
alty for delay of game.

With the game tied at 3-3 and
South Park shorthanded the Pitt
skaters had a chance to go ahead.
South Park turned the tide though
and scored to give them a 4-3 lead.

Thinelacls Open Outdoor 

Season In Ky. Relays

by VINCE DI NARDO

With the indoor track season
barely ended. the Pitt track team
gets back into action this weekend
in Kentucky. as they open their
outdoor season at the Kentucky
Relays.

Along with some of the top
schools in the East——Villanova.
Penn. Syracuse. Penn State. Pitt.
the second best team in the East
as a result of the IC4A's. will see
its first action of the spring.

Qualifiers
Seeded In
Crap Meet

Fifteen matches were held Mon-
day night at the Fitzgerald Field
House in the first round of the All-
Campus Wrestling Tournament.

In the first match of the eve- ‘

ning‘. Dan Ciccotelli went against
Dennis Ranalli. At the same time
Ed Everett and Don Weller were
wrestling. Ranalli won his con-
test as did Everett. The two win-
ners will go against each other in
the 125 pound weight class for the
championship of that division lat-
er this week.

Tom Bailey of Pi Kappa Alpha
advanced one bracket, set to com-
pete for the 135 pound champion-
ship. His‘ opponent on Monday
night was Bill Williams. Ron Curd
lost to Bill Hauch and Rich Zewe
beat Mike Repasky to set the
championship match in the 145
pound weight class. Hauch will
face Zewe for that title.

In the 155 pound division, Glenn
Shaw was pinned by Lauren Bran-
brugh with eight seconds left in
the contest.

The 165 pound class champion-i

ship was decided on Monday
night. Kevin Love pinned Paul
Carroll with 16 seconds left in
the first period to ice that divi-
sion. There were the only two
competitors in the 165 class.

Dan Hackworth lost to Craig
Evans while Vince Corsi of Phi
Gamma Delta beat Tom Smith.
Corsi was co-champion in the In-
terfraternity Wrestling Tourna-
ment at 170 pounds.

Bob Thompson of Fiji wrestled
twice on Monday night. In his first
match he defeated George Myers
and in his second contest he pin-
ned Jim Piper. This qualified him
for the finals in the 185 pound
class. He will take on Tom Schil-
linger who decisioned Tim Alt-
man, 6-2.

Joe Judeikis pinned Bob Noeth-
ling and Tom Porreca won by de-
fault to Lloyd Walker as the eve-
ning came to its last few contest.

In the last match of the night.
Carl Barlett pinned Brian Wad-
linger to set up thd card for the
135 pound weight class.

The relays will contain both
track and field events and Pitt will
have many athletes competing in
both phases.

Dan Kouvolo, who won the Flori-
da Relays last week with a heave
of 235 feet three inches, and Lou’
Frank will throw the _iavelin for
the tracksters. Frank and Kouvolo
were the only Pitt entrants in the
meet.

Bryant Salter. who had decided
earlier not to further his track
career but pursue a football one
instead. may change his mind
about the rest of the spring. but
he will not make the trip to Ken-
tucky. John Wilborn and Terry
Thompson will do the high jump-
mg.

Al Benaglio will pole vault for I

the thinclads and Steve Hein will
throw the discus as as well as the
shotput.

The mile relay team, intact
from the indoor season, will be
ready to take up where they left
off indoors. Smittie Brown, Dorel
Watley, Dennis Scatzman and
Ted Bobby will run the relay.

Track Coach Jim Banner is ex-
pecting big things from the mile
relay team. .

“If they don't run 3:10.5 we‘ll
be dissappointed.“ he said earlier
this year.

Banner doesn’t expect instant
success, but because of the bet-
ter conditions outdoors, some
time this spring theteam can be
expected to come close to that
mark. Indoors, the team’s best
time was 3: 17.5.

Jerry Richey will participate in ‘

the relays. but not as a member
of the Pitt track team. Richey‘s
eligibility is before the ECAC and
a decision is expected within a
week. Richey ran track in his
freshman yearand it is question-
able that he will be permitted to
compete. Richey will run the open
mile in Kentucky.

Rick Caroselli. Bill Kalchthater
and Elliot Drysdale will partici-
pate in a number of hurdling
events and Ted Bobby will also
try his hand in the intermediate
hurdles. .
