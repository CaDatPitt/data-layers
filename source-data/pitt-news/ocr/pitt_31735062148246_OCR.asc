“These gatherings help to create a
better ‘spirit and understanding be-
tween parentand 'ins’tru',ctor,7 and thus

Quite a number of Pittsburgh

plaining that their ﬂags were taken.

“The University therefore feels
that it is obligated for the return

disregard-mg the European war in earnest. Only once in awhile did a little

of it creep into the Weekly columns.

The presidential election of that year caused much interest among the

students, however.

‘detefmfne W110 they preferred for president. The result was’: Wilson, 511;
Hughes, 388; the Prohibition candi-9

date, 19; Socialist c‘and"i‘date, 34; and
the Industrial candidate, 1.
About this time a foreign trade

, There was no fear of the United"
States becoming involved in the war
expressed in the Week1y’s accounts

of what was discussed at these meet-
ings.

Shortly after the beginning of 1917,
a persistent undertone of preparation
It was not, however,
expressed in editorials, or in student
letters, but in the events reported in
the news stories of the paper.

The ﬁrst military science training
was started during this period, and a
branch of the Red Cross was organ-
ized. The Socialist Club changed its
name to the Social Science Club to
avoid misunderstanding.

One of the members of the Inter-
national Polity Club attended a con-
vention of college students at Wash-
ington, D. C. in an attempt to pre-
vent a declaration of war by the
United States. They advocated a ref-
erendum before Congress made any
declaration of war.

in the Weekly, “Pitt was drawn into
active preparedness circles when the
Federal- Government designated the
University wireless stationas a listen-
Ving‘-indepot for Western Pennsylva-
nia.” " ‘ " '

Representatives from the United
States navy spoke before students
calling for recruits.

On April 6 the United States de-
clared war on Germany.

The April 11 issue of the IWeekly
carried a banner head stating that
“PITT STUDENTS BEGIN DRILL-
ING TODAY.” Battalion drill was
announced, and a United States army
captain spoke to an assembly of very
patriotic students.

He said. “The country gives you

activities‘ still went on. There was
another march scheduled for that day
in addition to the parade of 'so1diers-
the grand march for the junior prom.

On the front page near the drill
story which had overshadowed the
junior prom, was a call for war slo-

you original? Want to help your
country? I Think up some snappy war
slogans that would appear well on
posters.”

For the ﬁrst time in months, the
editors commented on the war. In
this April 11 issue‘ they said, “We
have elected to take an active part in
the war which means that either we
must bow to a system of absolutism
or place in the hands of the civilized
world the greatest gift of God, De-
mocracy . . . We have no quarrel
with the German people.”

A later editorial asked that the
University supply as many men as
the University of Pennsylvania. They
quoted from that university’s paper.
“If the government wants 2,000 men
from our student ranks there is no
doubt that it will get them.”

The University also wanted to sup-
ply 2,000 students—just a few months
ago concerned only with how large
a score they were going to beat their
football rivals by—to die in the mud
in France.

We Take Notes
On a Holiday '

With Monday’s football hangover behind us, we _

can look back upon what has been described as one
of the most “orderly” post-game celebrations in re-
cent years. It has often been pointed out that the

’ ideaofa ‘football holiday is an immature one, but

apparently students of Pittsburgh schools still feel
that the thrill of victory in the seasoii’s most im-
portant game should be celebrated by a Monday
walkout.

In this year ’s celebration, students of the Uni-
versity and of Carnegie Tech showed the best spirit
yet evidenced between the two schools. Special
praise is due the Carnegie Tech student body for
their splendid cooperation with Student-Faculty
Association president Pat Cusick in his efforts to
make the Pitt celebration orderly.

To-oh’s Dormitory Council

. .  ;headed by. Gene Musial,Tartan football‘
player, made the goalpost ceremony possible for the
two schools. 'l‘ech’s dorm men first captured the
Pitt goalposts, and their friendly spirit smoothed
the way for the award of the new trophy to the
‘University.

For their attempts to plan an orderly ceremony
as a. satisfactory way out of the celebration prob-
lem, we feel that the Carnegie Tech Student Coun-
cil and the University SFA are deserving of recog-
nition.

The University, however, slipped on one point.
A football holiday can’t be delayed until 12:30

»,o’cloek, no lI1‘d.‘l3t€I‘,, how badly. the planners may

want to avoid disruption of class schedules. The
‘spirit behind a football celebration is spontaneous,
as Monday ’s outburst proved.

One sour note that came from the day ’s celebra-
tion was the action of a group of University stu-
dents who made a misguided attempt to give the

Community Fund Drive
. . some free publicity. By removing the Com-
munity Fund ﬂags from the city streets, the stu-
dents gave themselves black eyes in the opinions of
many Pittsburgliers. V
On the Whole, Monday’s celebration was a smal__l
start toward havingfootball demohstrations repre-
sent, as far as they ever can, something of the Uni-
versity spirit. This was accomplished because of
the attitude of cooperation between the majority of

« .- students of Carnegie. Teeh.and- the University. It I

'- - Gontrasted with "the action of the .student~ body. on
Monday morning, an incident atithe game Saturday
brought home the difference between Pitt “school spirit”
and clean sportsmanship.

We had the good fortune to sit in front ofa Carnegie
Tech man and woman. Throughout the game they acted
like mature college students. When Pitt made their
touchdown. we happened to turn around.

The girl was crying and the fellow looked sincerely
downcast. lMoreover, after the game was over they

SFA. head Pat Cusick speaking for the student body
said, .“Let’s show the city and the country that sports-

Editor, the Pitt News: I .
Now that one of the downtown papers has very
-conspicuously featured a “scoop” made by a freshman
at the University, I/am led to wonder just how long
ourgschool spirit is going to be held up toridicule be-
fore the public, and how long we “are goingto stand by
idly and watch our University lambasted‘ and criticized

H by an unfavorable press. '- —

Surely, our students are not as gullible has the public
At least let _our intelligence

exist only in the minds of the people who write them.

I believe, like my other fellow students do, that our
loyalty and devotion to our University is of the same
caliber as that of other students in other schools. Yet,
our University is always singled out for these contempt-
ible articles that appear in the front pages of news-
papers.

Undoubtedly, these unfair articles will continue to
appear  long as the students remain lax in the dis-
charge of their duties towards the University. So, let
us awake from our lethargy,-and prove once more, not
to skeptical students but to “a skeptic student” that we
are true and faithful students who believe in the ideals
that ou.r University is endeavoring to uphold.

Sincerely yours.‘

  Sports

SIBELINES

By BILL McELWAIN
? Editor

THERE ARE TIMIES when a sports writer feels foolish. Sat-

urday was one of them. The boys downtown felt foolish because

they had picked the Tartans to

win. We felt foolish because of

some comments we had made once about a sophomore halfback

named Jones.
When we printed an analysis

of sophomore stars in general, and

used Washington’s Sterling, West Virginia’s McCann, and 1>i1;t’s
Jones as horrible examples of over-publicity, we did it with the

best intentions.

But the analysis backﬁred. Our best friends stopped speaking

to us.

People we had never seen before introduced themselves so

that they, too, might stop speaking. We never realized Jones had so
many friends. Still, we had the moral satisfaction of knowing that
Edgar hadn’t had a chance to prove us wrong.

Edgar Comes Through

Even that is gone now. Edgar camethrough.

If people think we were to hard on Eddie, we ’re willing to admit
it. We can only hope that all errors of judgment will be exposed

by such satisfying evidence.

, It took the Scranton Woxv a wh.ile to get warmed up Saturday.
His ﬁrst ball carrying attempt only picked up eight or nine yards, and

his ﬁrst pass was incomplete.

One reason for its failure may have

been that both: Pitt and Tech men scurried for safety when Eddie
blistered the ball over the line much in the manner of Bob Feller

striking out Joe Dimaggio.

Outwits Tachlers

the Tartans dizzy, then smacked
a ‘pass that gained 20 yards.

' ‘v. , Later on,,he began to improve. ..\Vith Bobby. Thurbon, he ran

Jack Goodridge in the ribs with

His touchdown heave came while three

our four Skibo tacklers were deciding which one should formally
break up the play by smearing the Jones boy.

Eddie evidently grew tired waiting for them to make up their

minds, for he twisted away from

one clutching hand, spun around

like a ballet‘ dancer, and flipped the ball almost out of the Stadium.
Thurbon and Rettinger were in the Tech end zone behind the Tech
safety man, and Thurbon pulled in the ball a yard from the limit

of the playing ﬁeld.
Relief for Cassiano

As the Tartans tried to come back with passes, Jones put the

crowd on its feet with a 50-yard

only t'o have the officials call Pitt for an offside.

runback of an intercepted aerial,
Pitt had the ball a

few plays later, and Eddie ended the fun by taking the snapback,
hesitating for what seemed minutes, then streaking for the sidelines

and. the dressing room.

Regardless of yvhat it ‘means to anyone else, we know that Jones’
success Isa big relief to Dick Cassiano, for whom Eddie is a sub. The
backﬁeld star has worn himself out all year trying to be the com-

_plete Pitt‘ running attack, and with Jones seeing more frequent

service, Cass will have a. chance to rest and should -be an even better

‘ p'e1'f9«rme'r-«.than he‘-in-ow is.

Perhaps we‘ will be accused of going outon the opposite limb
from our ;original stand on Jones, hence, wouldn’t it be nice for Pitt
to have another All-American left halfback?

With the fall intramural activi-
ties in their ﬁnal stages,-the spot-
light shifts to the competition in
the ﬁve-sport winter program,
scheduled to get under way, Wed-
nesday, December 6.
I Spirited rivalry in three leagues,
fraternity, independent, and engineer-
ing, will constitute the scheduling set-
up for the ﬁve sports: basket ball,
volley ball, handball, table tennis,
and bowling. Each athlete may play
in only two of the ﬁve.
Track and Swimming

In addition to the regularly sched-
sports, an indoor track meet and a

.p0I't.unity sfQ1" participation. The two
sport rule will not be in effect re-
garding these contests. '

The Phi Kappa cagers lay their
basket ball crown on the line, but
will be a prohibitive choice to snatch
it up again with Dick Cassiano, Butch
Goodell, Jack Glenn, and Tommy
Halloran available to defend the title
won last year.

Newmans Favored

The Newman Club will be favored
to retain their Independent league
toga, because two gentlemen from
lVIcKeesport (their names-are Joe and
-Fran-k)"‘and"Joe‘ Dunn are veteran
members of the»quintet. Pep Croker,
stalwart of the Oil and Gas passers,
last 'winter’s engineering winner,
makes his team a strong favorite to
keep the engineering title.

All leagues will play a round robin
tournament, the winners of the three
divisions ﬁnally meeting for the all-
intramural cage championship. Floor
games will be staged at both Trees
Gym and Pitt Stadium.

Phi Gams Defend

Phi Gamma Delta tosses its volley
ball crown into the ring; gridders
Earl Pressel and Bobby Thurbon head
the defense committee. A six-man
team represents each club in a round
robin tourney played at Trees Gym.

The leading table tennis exponents
last year were the Delts. Their prexy

Two Football Men Turn Sports Writers;
Laud Spirit of Teammates, Student Body

‘By’ Jack Benz and Paul Foley
One of the local sports writers has
said that this year’s Pitt team has
more spirit and determination than
any other Pitt team he has ever seen.
Saturday’s game seemed to prove
this point to a lot of people who had
been doubters.
In 1930 Pitt went into this annual
battle the underdog, and came out

,on top with a one point victory, 7-6.
;This year, again the underdog, they
:came through to knock the kilts off
gthe Techites. The game was hard
lfought all the way through and after
wan almost costly fumble. the boys
ifought their way to the unexpected
‘but deserving win.

Johnny Dickinson, although in-
jured in the opening plays, was a
great inspiration to the team. John-
ny had pulled us out of a hole a week

A
7

before, so We owed this one to him.
The fellows wanted to get.the ball
for him to show their appreciation.
Ted Konetsky and Ben Kish show-
ed real ﬁght and spirit. Ted was in-
jured early in the game but stayed
in for a good part of the afternoon.
Ben played from the ﬁrst quarter on
with a broken bone in his leg. %
This week we play a strong outﬁt
from Nebraska. We all know from

‘Pitt-in-China’ to Receive  

 From Campus Fund

University Works on Plan to Help Exchange
Student to Lingnan with Tuition, Expenses '°

[Editor’s Note: This is the first

of a series of articles describing the

student projects towards which 75 per cent of the Student Community

Chest funds are dz‘-vet‘-ted.]5

Least known of the student projects to which student aid from the
Campus Community Chest is given has been Lingnan university, “Pitt-in-

China.”

Founded during the latter part of the last century as Canton Christian

college, Lingnan university changed its name shortly after 1900, according!

to Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of women, who is chairman of Pitt-in—China.

Since 1914 on, Lingnan has received¢

contributions from the Pitt student‘
body, which donated as much as
$1,600 during the late ’20s.

The original plan of Pitt-in-China
was to support a professor or gradu-
ate assistant at the Canton school,
such as students from Pennsylvania
State college or the University of
Pennsylvania do. Rece”n‘tly attention
has been given to the plan for junior
year exchange of two students be
tween Linganan and the University.
University Moves‘

When. the Japanese army invaded
South China, Lingnan university
moved to Hong Kong, where the Uni-
versity of Hong Kong has given her
the use of the Hong Kong campus.
The Canton campus, being American
property, has not, however, been
touched by the ravages of war.

Dr. Henry S. Frank, ’22, head of the
department of chemistry at Lingnan
university, is no-w a visiting profes-
sor hereat the University. He is on
leave of absence from Lingnan, where
he has taught for several years, since
Pitt-in—Chin.a ﬁrst sent him.

Helps During Invasion

Dr. Frank in describing the work of
Lingnan university, and of Pitt-in-
China, told of the services rendered
by the university during the Japanese
invasions of Canton. Strangely, al-
though he willingly told of incidents
both in favor of the Chinese and the
Japanese, Dr. Frank never mentioned
the Japanese except as such, never
calling them invaders, attackers, or
any similar name.

When refugees began to descend

upon Canton, the universitty agreed
to house 7,200 of the 20,000 in the
city. On the ﬁelds of its college of
agriculture, and of rice ﬁelds donated
by ﬂeeing Chinese landowners, the

faculty and students raised Ameri-

can ﬂags, conscripted experienced
coolie labor and harvested the rice.
They were also able to purchase and
recondition a rice mill which supplied
all the meal for the entire city."

A slaughterhouse and a beannery
were added to the university’s serv-
ices before long, Dr. Frank explained.
As experienced Chinese drifted into
the refugee camp from the mountains,
Lingnan went into the charcoal burn-
ing, the bean sprouts, and the brick
manufacturing industry. “Before we
ﬁnished,” Dr. Frank said, “we had.
women weav.ing cloth. In fact, we
were a self contained community.”
Classes in English

Classes at Lingnan are conducted
almost entirely in English. In fact,
several of the professors, of whom 25
per cent are American, would have a
hard time otherwise. One-third of
the 500,students are girls and sev-
eral coeds have been exchange stu-
dents at Lingnan university.

Pitt—in-China hopes to eventually
raise enonugh money to provide the
tuition and living expenses for a Pitt
exchange student to Lingnan as a
movement toward international good-
will. The interest which Urfiversity
students display in Pitt—in—China this

year and subsequent years will de— .

termine how soon this plan can be
inaugurated, Miss Amos said.

Students March

Continued from page one
ited with starting the celebration by
invading the upper. campus and the
School of Dentistry buildings. How-
ever, as the parade proceeded toward
downtown Pittsburgh, past the School
‘of Pharmacy buildings on the Boule-
vard of the Allies, many students
were still in class.

The route of the parade was orig-
inally intended to go down the Boule-
vard of the Allies and back up

the downtown Golden Triangle. Dif-

ﬁculty started when attempts were
made to split the parade into smaller
units, each of which then proceeded
over theentire section trying to re-
join the main body of student cars.

The groups of cars ﬁnally proceed-
ed ‘back to Tech at 12:30 o’clock for
the “scheduled” demonstration. After
the exchange of a few cheers, they
disbanded and returned to the Cathe-
dral.

, Band members, several of whom-
did not take the unofﬁcial jaunt into
the Triangle, organized a swing ses-
sion dance in 124 Cathedral shortly
afterwards. Students danced to the
jubilant victory music for about an
hour when the room was cleared to
make way for a regularly scheduled,
regularly attended class.

Two students were injured during
the celebration. Dick Frankovich,
C41, suffered a severed achilles
tendon, and William Roben, was
admitted to the University hospital.

Complaints were received from
various building superintendents in

a good celebration in every respect.

Skill Evinced
In Year’s First
SF A Concert

By Denton Beal

Displaying unusual skill and art-
istry, Jean Lewis and William
Schneider, violinist and baritone,
successfully entertained an enthu-
siastic audience at the ﬁrst Concert
Hour presented by SFA and the de-
partment of music appreciation at
Foster Memorial on Monday.

Of the more brilliant selections
played by Miss Lewis, the most suc-
cessful were deFal1as’ Danse Espag-
nole, in the Kreisler arrangement,
and Kreisler’s Caprice Viennoise
whose slightly saccharine double-
stops were admirably executed.

Miss Lewis’ depth of tone made
Wieniawski’s Romance, from the
second concerto, probably the audi-
ence’s favorite, while the charming
Caprice XX of the famous Paganini
was given an equally effective treat-
ment. The remaining number on
Miss Lewis’ portion of the program
was Sar'aste’s Zigeunerweisen, a
number of great technical difficulty.

Mr. Schneider possesses a-n ad-
mirably trained voice, which seems
at its best in the lower register. For
this reason the best of the Lieder on
his program was Brahm’s lovely Sap-
phic Ode which Mr. Schneider sang
with feeling but dignity well suited
to the music.

Not the least of his good qualities 1

lies in his ﬁne diction, the clarity of
which combined with a vigorous if
not powerful expression, caused the
popular aria Se Vuol Ballere from
Mozart’s Marriage of Figaro to be re-
ceived with great applause. A popu-
lar note was added to the program by
the sentimental paganism of Kip-
ling’s Road to Mandalay in the well
known setting of Oley Speaks.

Miss Lewis was accompaniedby
her mothers, Mrs. H. G. Lewis. The
accompaniment for Mr. Schneider
was furnished by Mr. Harry Goldby
in his usual ﬂawless manner.

Dr. Allen to Speak

Because Dr. Edward Condon, re-

the date of the meeting has been
changed to next Tuesday, Lou spar-

Another reason Sparvero gave for
the change in the date is that Sigma

that evening.
