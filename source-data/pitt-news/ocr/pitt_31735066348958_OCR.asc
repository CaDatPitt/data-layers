In Wake of Ticket Protest

BY BILL MOORE

The amount of seating allocated
to students at home football games
has been increased, the controver-
sial student coupon book distribu-
-tion plan has been retained, and a
committee has been called for to
study possible alternatives and
make reccomendations for future
ticket allocation, under a statement
issued late Tuesday by Chancellor
Wesley Posvar.

Posvar and Athletic Director
Casimir Myslinski released state-
ments Tuesday night in the wake of
numerous student complaints
about the coupon system and a call
by student leaders for Myslinski’s
resignation because of alleged
inconsistencies in his handling of
the ticket matter.

Following release of the type-

.. written reactions, student leaders

expressed mixed reactions--laud-
ing the increased student seating
and asking for guarantees of future

early Wednesday, “The coupon
system was based on the premise
that -we must have equity in

distributing a scarce commodity--- ;

football tickets. Based on previous
attendance, with an approximate
10% increase in the number of
student seats, there is no longer a
scarcity. Therefore, there is no
longer a’ need for a coupon system.

“It is absurd to suggest it is good
planning to create a system for
which there is no need.”

' In his statement, Posvar said he
believed Myslinski has done a
commendable job in his post. “I
believe that this success merits a
sincere effort at understanding and
strong support,” he said. ’

Myslinski in his lengthy state-
ment explained the system used for
allocating stadium seating, and

9,200 seats to a possible 10,010
seats, if demand for the coupon
booklets warrants such an increase.

Students are guaranteed 9,200
seats, and a possible 810 additional.
free tickets, pending clariﬁcation of
student demand for coupon books.

Students also will be given
access to 300 student or date
tickets, 300 School of General
Studies student tickets, and the
regular public seating. Date tickets
will cost $7, while General Studies
tickets will be sold at half the
normal price. .

Myslinski explained that his use
of the term ‘sell-out’ in his previous
dealings with students meant that
the request for tickets had
surpassed the available seating,‘
even though not all tickets had
been distributed. I

Charges leveled at the system
came from. -Student Government

(RSA) President Jim Datovech and
Panhellenic Association President
Sue Turner.

Although 24-hour visitation

study groups held during the"

spring and summer terms were
used as a source of student opinion
in developing the new policy,
Hubbard maintained that because
of the small number of people
living on campus at the time, this
was insufficient. ' ‘

“As far as I’m concerned, they
did not have representation on the
part of students there. _ Moye’s
office said they were unhappy with
the amount they had,” Hubbard
said_. No spokesman for the Office
of Student Affairs was available to

weren’t enough here. Most of the
students here were foreign ex-

who were about to go back home, ,

or senior students here only to get
enough credits to get out in

“In essence what you had were a
lot of students who would be only
indirectly effected by the policy;
you didn't have the students who
would be back here in September.
We had very little of them,"
Hubbard said.

RSA president Datovech held a
similar position. A

‘.‘It's our, feeling the escort
system is viable and could possibly
work, -but we've had concern

“There was no real student input

A student complained that he has been unjustly
denied in-state resident status by the Residency Office. He

said that after living, working and going to school in’

Pennsylvania for 12 months, he should be considered a
resident with in-state tuition privileges. Revealing further
details of this case may jeopardize the student's position
since he is appealing the decision to the Residency Appeals
Committee soon.

According to Residency Officer. Dennis K. Pratt, there
are guidelines for students attempting to establish
permanent residence in Pennsylvania.

The important guidelines in this case demand that a
student live in the state for I2 months without attending a
university or college, and that he be a citizen or

&;_flCll10nSll'atC intentions of becoming one. In addition, a
' student under 21 is assumed to have the domicile of his

 

parents unless he proves to be an emancipated minor
(ﬁnancially independent of parents). Students attempting

to gain residency may not be ‘receiving aid from another M

   

A person must adequately demonstrate that he intends
to reside in the state if the 12-month period is not up. He
cannot, however, apply for residency solely for the purpose
of attending a university or college.

The student in question did not sufficiently demonstrate
that his residency would permanently be in Pennsylvania,
and not solely for educational purposes, Pratt said.

Though the 12 months is set up in the guidelines, a
student may try to establish residency in less than the
designated time.

"For instance, if a person is transferred to a job in
Pittsburgh. buys a house and moves his family here under
the 12-month guideline, it may be considered by the
Residency Office that he plans to permanently reside in
Pennsylvania.‘ He thus would be givenin-state tuition
privileges," Pratt said. ‘

“We considereach case. as individually and fairly as
possiblebut we must make decisions according to -the

If

guidelines, ,

Pratt said. -“,The-gburden falls on me ,to

  

interpret what is intended in the guidelines.”

Pratt admitted the guidelines are unclear as of now but I '  

he said he hoped they would be made more exact.

 

“If a student feels the'decision is unjust, as in the.- , 1 V 
previous case, he can appeal to the Residency Appeals 1 .. 1 

Committee, which is comprised of ﬁve University-_. 

administrators. A hearing is set in which the student may
present his case, The Committee then ‘presents
recommendations to the Residency Officer to uphold or
change the decision. _
“it is important that the students get a fair hearing. 01

assume every student may appeal,” Pratt said. ‘‘If I feel ‘

that the Committee will definitely change it, I change it.”

About 60% of the petitions are changed in favor of the-
students, according to Pratt.

Students wanting to establish in-state residency should
pick‘ up available material on the matter in the Residency
Office.

Knowing the guidelines will helpthe students avoid .

error in the petitioning for domicile in Pennsylvania.

Seating Increased After Protest  

( Continued from Page 1)

Platt, in his reaction, also stated
he was pleased with the addition of
the extra 810 free student seats,
and asked for a guarantee the same
number of free seats would be
available next year.

He ‘stressed the importance of
the proposed ad hoc committee,

-and asked that half the group be

student members. “The commit-

‘ gtee’s_recommendations should be

binding--not considered and then
tossed aside,” he said.
. Concerning the call for Myslin-

. ski’s resignation, he said, I think it

is clear Mr. Myslinski deceived the
students on the issue, and I am
waiting for the chancellor to deal
with the situation.”

lnterfratemity Council head Ed
Riefenstahl, instrumental in draw-
ing up the initial student demands,
said he was pleased to see the
“decisive action” taken by the
administration, and was equally
pleased with the added seating.

He echoed Platt’s request for
assurance that the same number of
seats would be available next year
at no cost to students.

there are now more student seats
available than there have ever been
students at football games,” he
said.

He added he hoped something
could be worked out in regard to
the coupon system and said, “I
hope the avenue for communication
will remain open between students
and administrators.”

Panhellenic President Sue Tur-
ner said she felt the new number of
student seats would be sufficient to
meet the demand.” Student leader
concern was not exaggerated, and
administrators have heard our
voices. I’m pleased Posvar and
Myslinski worked the situation out

. this way,” she said.

She questioned Myslinski’s
statement that he always accom-
odated students. “He accom-
modated them in the past because

it was no problem. Now that
student interest is greater, he
hasn't made students his first
priority,” she said.

“Many students have stated 0-

concern that the athletic depart-
ment has turned into big busi-
ness," she added.

Reactions from other student
leaders were similar to those of
Platt, Riefenstahl and Turner. _

No exact procedure was stated
for establishing the ad hoc
committee that Posvar said would.
study the ticket situation..

distributed until tomorrow. Under
plans layed out earlier this week,

Mosque Show

Nearly 200 youths without tickets
threw bottles and rocks at
Pittsburgh police when they were
denied admission to a sold-out rock
concert last night at the Syria
Mosque.

A crowd gathered early in the
evening before the Average White
Band concert was to start, police
said, and several ticket holders had
their tickets stolen as the doors
opened. People overﬂowed onto
Bigelow Boulevard, and when told
to disperse, many would-be scalp-
ers began to throw empty bottles
and rocks at the traffic control
police.

‘ Mosque officials said the trouble

-didn’t _extend inside; the doors

were not crashed and . the concert
went on as scheduled.‘ The police
calledthe matter routine.

Several arrests. reportedly were
made, none involving Pitt students.
A few people ‘were taken to
Presbyterian g,Hospital for treat-
ment, according to police.’

The concert situation may ..have
led to other incidents outside the
Mosque, police‘ said. 7Reports of

made, some alledgedly near the.

Sue Turner, Panhellenic Associ-

the relevance of the study made

-this summer, not only to the dorms

based. .

“Amos Hall was not occupied
when th'ey did the survey. It's valid
for the Tower dorms in the spring
and summer, but not in the
fall--and it's definitely not valid for
Amos Hall" Turner said.

“I think one of our major gripes

-problems are unique."

Residence Life Director Fred
Fonseca responded to the criticism,
saying the ofﬁce was forced to act
on the basis of the information
available to them because of time
constraint.

“I think we were in the position
where we had to make some
decision,” Fonseca said. “We
tried to involve as many students as
we could--we sent out notice to
every spring and summer student.
Time was running short and a
‘lecision had to be made.”

Hubbard also was angered by
what he felt was a violation of an
earlier understanding that the
summer study groups’ ﬁndings
would not be used as a basis for
security policy. .

“They passed out this survey for
the groups under the title “24-hour
visitations."_ The way I got it from
Residence Life was that nothing
(official) would come of these study
groups.

“They just wanted the reports to‘

be submitted to Fonseca; Fonseca
in turn would write up a general
report to‘ submit to‘ Moye. No
policy whatsoever was to be made
from these study groups,” Hub-
bard said.

Datovech‘s account varied
slightly, but still expressed the
view that the groups were not to be
used as the sole source of student
opinion in the formation of a
security system.

“Fonseca said we could look at a
wide range of options, even
changing physical plant systems
and how you would do it. He said
there would be no speciﬁc plans
without getting back to students."

Fonseca responded to these
complaints calmly.

“We are under some criticism
that we used the study groups as a
reason and way of changing policy
change. I know I personally
explained it to the students
involved. I told Chip Hubbard
clearly some ﬁndings could be used
for this," Fonseca said.

Hubbard outlined an area of
possible inconvenience to students
living in the dorms.

“Monday night football is
supposed to be coming up pretty
soon, and the TV room in Tower A
is always crowded for it. As it_
stands, if you are not a resident of
Tower A, or you don’t know
somebody who lives there you can't
get in to see the TV room. Less
than a third of the Towers residents
have access to the TV room,”
Hubbard explained.

Datovech also dealt with the
issue of access to dorm facilities in
relation toithe new security plan.

“There’s no provision for getting
into the TV room, the conference
room or the RSA ofﬁce. They want
to do it by having people sign in,
but that defeats the security
system," Datovech said.

“In effect it's an easy way to get

Turner said, “It's.the consensus

when their residences are unoccu-

there's little vandalism or intru-,

 Still Unanswered . . .

The statements released by Chancellor Wesley Posvar and Athletic
Director Casimir Myslinski last night reﬂect a positive attitude in
‘approaching the ticket distribution system.

The additional seating for football games, as announced by the

_ » Chancellor, will beneﬁt students at the games and may provide for all

S squeeze. The ad hoc committee has the potential for usefully applying

student input to the tickets problem, thus providing a lasting, viable
solution to the controversy.

‘ . in ’ jAd‘hoc committees are ﬁne gestures, but will it be a committee of

 " displayed

by administration in formulating the original ticket plan?

Myslinski still has not explained the sale of tickets on Friday and

in possibly ‘before that to the satisfactionof student leaders.
  .The extra seats at games, the ad hoc committee, all of these are

proper and responsible replies by the Chancellor. They do not address
all the questions, and certainly more is at issue here than extra football

 A game seats.

The real question raised here is about the policy-making system
within the University that may have brought forth a bureaucratic
tangle, certainly without student interaction or planning. ,
. ‘Tomake a wise policy, anyone, including students and chancellors,
must have the facts.

In the case of the coupon distribution system, something went
wrong.

 What about Myslinski?

The call for the resignation of Athletic Director Casimir Myslinski by
‘several student leaders comes on the heels of one of the hottest issues
to .hit the Pitt campus in a long time--football coupons.

« i Because of Myslinski’s involvement with the new ticket distribution
system and his self-damaging statements on the issue, students ﬁnally

This_is not the first time Myslinski’s conduct has outraged students
-in regard to sporting programs at Pitt. Last year the athletic director
was embroiled in controversies over tickets for the Penn State football
‘ game and funding for the Pitt Hockey Club. There have been ,
numerous other occasions when he and students haven’t seen
eye-to-eye.
' But the current crisis concerning how students will be permitted to

i enter Pitt Stadium for this season’s football games has backed
 . Myslinski into a corner. .

LI-lisproﬁleasanadministratortookasuddenturnfortheworse
when he was caught, ontape, misrepresenting information about the
availability of seats for this year’s Notre Dame game. Myslinski

/>  claimed  had been sold out in May, prompting administrators
' to  a1 new ticket distribution plan--one that would prevent

overcrowding, thus decreasing the possibility of violence at the

H. stadimn. V

Upon discovering that tickets for the game were still on sale last
Friday, student leaders resisted implementation of the plan, calling the
rationale for it baseless and contrived.

The leaders then demanded the resignation of Myslinski because of .
his deception, whether deliberate or unintentional, throughout the
ticket controversy.

In light of Myslinski’s misrepresentations concerning the tickets, his

" consistently poor receptiveness to students, and statements rmde by

several of his fellow administrators supporting these charges, it
A appears that a thorough investigation into Myslinski’s dealings should
be launched.
The investigation should take into account the athletic director's past
‘conduct and his present dodging on the ticket issue. It should be
mindful of the tremendous revenue spent each year by the Athletic

. Department and the increasing prominence the department has gained

~ because of Pitt’s winning team.
The investigation must be objective, with students, faculty and
administrators on the commission.

Big Time Money,
Student Expense

Once again big time football has
returned to Pitt and with it has
come the incentive to make the big
time money, at the expense of the
student, the perpetual supporter of
Pitt’s athletics. Greed has
motivated our University to abuse
the student it was designed to
serve. It was the same student who
was in no manner consulted as to

the creation and development of ,

the new ticket policy. Thestudent
was forced to accept this unfair and
unreasonable policy.

We as students’ still wish to
support Pitt Athletics, but ﬁnd it.
impossible. considering the ad-
ministration's present policies and
practices. We demand our
University to revamp its athletic
policy and over-all student policies.

There are several reasons for our
strong feelings on this matter. Note
that Pitt students supported their
football team during the many lean
years--years when no one else
would have a thing to do with the
team. Both on and off the field, the
Pitt students haveiibeen the most
consistent bloc of supporters that
the team has known.

While we ﬁnd the resulting new
ticket distribution, plan unpalat-
able, we feel the method used to
bring about such an end to be
degrading, insulting, and a tra-
vesty of the concept of trust which
the University Administration con-
cedes publicly to rely upon so
heavﬂy.

You will please note the lack of
student participation in the devel-
opment of this plan. Even a request

Phi Delta Theta Fraternity

Lying to and
Ignoring Students

With the idea of the “coupon
system” instated' by University
ofﬁcials, many students are left
unsure of what is really going on
with Pitt football tickets this year.

Being Greek and having dis-
cussed this issue in mass with other
Greeks, l had readily agreed to

accept the system seeing no other_

alternative in sight. It has its
feasible points and its not-so-
feasible points but the old system
was far from fool-proof either.

Now, over the weekend, a
student goes to the Football Ticket
Ofﬁce and ﬁnds that tickets do,
indeed, remain for the Notre
Dame-Pitt game. According to
Athletic Director Caz Myslinski, all
tickets were sold for the game.
Upon this reasoning, they institu-
ted this new coupon system.

It is not that the few hundred

tickets that remain will solve the

problem for the students. But, the
point from this whole dreary issue
is that the administration has
totally ignored the students. Those
same students who sat in the rain
and snow during those 1-10

‘ 1:‘ ‘sund-
‘r-rzitnj

it was, are being overlooked.

If the “coupon system” was the
only way, I, like all other students,
had to accept it. The point is that
the administration had lied to us
‘and the communication gap had
better be mended soon.

l hope that the return of big-time
football has not reached the
extreme to totally ignore all
students. If it has. bring back Carl
DcPasqua and the “three run and
punt" offense.

The ND Sellout
And Waiting List

In the last two weeks, much
discussion and attention has been
given to the concern of the new
football program. Since the Pitt

football team has improved, the -

interest of the athletic department
has been purely monetary with no
concern for the students’ interests.
This weekend has brought about
interesting facts concerning the
deceit and lies a university
administrator has used to develop a
ticket program.

Yes--open your eyes Joe and
Susie student. This University is
out to screw you! Did you know
they developed a system based on-
the fact that the Notre Dame game
was sold out so fast and many
people were on a waiting list. .:
Thus, they felt a system was
needed. Bullshit! The game is not:
sold out and you can buy tickets for_
all your friends and they will still,
have tickets left over. ,

Mr. Posvar--do you hold a
control on your administrators or
do they run you!

We have played your game with
your cards and we tried to resolve
our differences. But the cards were
marked! What is wrong--can’t the
athletic director play fairly?

We need answers now--not
tomorrow!

Richard Tarquinio
President, Phi Kappa Theta

Bringing Violence
Down Off the Hill

This letter is directed to Casimir
Myslinski, \. concerning football
seating for students.

The coupon system seems to
contain many problems, too many
to work with any real justice.

'The games against Navy, Notre

‘ Dame and Penn State will not only

be the biggest games of this year,
but we have the best chance of
winning these gamesas any Pitt
team in the last decade. Yet
many upperclassmen could miss
these games, and it was these fans
that suffered through the lean
years.

What wouldhappen if you have a
blue ticket to the Homecoming
game and your date has a red
coupon which would exclude her
from the game? What is to happen
when the fraternities and sorori-
ties, who are the most vociferous

group on campus when they are-

excluded?

One of the points brought out in
the September 5 issue of the Pitt
News by Chancellor Posvar was “if
hundreds or thousands of students
were to be turned away from the
game, a serious violence problem

. could be on our hands.” We would

like to know what will prevent
violence from ‘occurring at the
Student Union when hundreds or
thousands of students are denied
tickets for Penn State or Notre
Dame. The only change we see is
that the violence has been brought
down off the hill and on to the
campus!

It seems, in our opinion, that if the
University and the Athletic De-
partment were not so money-hun-
gry, they would see that the most
logical solution is, rather than
excluding students, to open one or
two more sections to the students.
This action would enable all the
students to attend the games. After
all. without the students the
football team and the University
itself would fail to exist.

Back on the streets

BY TOM WASELESKI

, Recall that Napoleon Bonaparte
was sent into exile twice before
Europe was really free from his
yoke.

Though Richard Nixon has
brought disgrace upon himself
several times, his se/If-enclosure at
San Clemente is his first truly
"historic banishment. And from all
indications, the brooding of this
tragic figure may be short-lived.

In a court deposition concerning
the ownership of his Presidential
tapes and papers, private citizen

7“_Z‘,:~lixon came off like the cocky young

punks he and his ﬁrst vice
president used to relish berating in
public addresses back in the good
old days when no one had anything
on them. Pretty snappy perfor-
mance for a man who reportedly
has been in the depths of emotional
despair, at death’s dark door, and
among democracy’s most unloved
characters--all in the space of
twelve months.

Mr. Dobrovir, attorney for
columnist Jack Anderson :' “Do you
believe that the public at large, as
opposed to the special prosecutor,
has a right to know the complete
story?”

“Must Present Official ID Cards

      

 

Mr. Nixon: “If my counsel
doesn’t I would never put my
wisdom above his.”

Richard Nixon is deﬁnitely alive
and kicking. Scratching and
snarling. And though he may not
have his sights set on 1976, he
doesn’t really need it.

He never had the book thrown at
him or scarcely even a letter of the
law. He is preparing a ‘courtroom
battle that could result in his
receiving the only deﬁnitive evi-
dence history will ever have against
him, his tapes and papers. His
favorite line in court these days is
one he’s used to repeating, the one
about executive privilege and
safeguards for the Presidency he
did so much to despotize.

So while Nixon is trying to burn
history before it gets a chance to be
leaked into the history books by
Ellsbcrg or‘ somebody, he is doing
his part to bolster the economy by
not telling the “truth” (does
counsel know what is meant by
“truth?”) for free. I mean, really,
to suggest that the truth belongs to
everyone is downright socialistic.
So the high-priest of free enterprise
is going to market it. I can hardly
wait to see whether the royal
audience is ﬁlmed before a rolling
fire or along the raging Pacific.

At any rate, what it all points up
to is a classic example of the second
offender who returns to his former
ways because he has not been
rehabilitated. And what is even
more ‘classic is the way Nixon is
sticking it to the American people;
he must be deriving trememdous

It.

satisfaction, since he has always
blamed the media for bringing on
his fall. Yet it is through the media
that he is going to present himself
as the victim of circumstance.

There have been many jokes
about Nixon’s desire to be a “law
and order president.” Perhaps the
trouble with American justice is
that it isn’t run like President
Ford’s “trickle-down” economics,
whereby the major components of
the economy (Gulf, Standard,’ GM,
et. al.) are given the means for
ﬁnancial vigor in the hopes that the
beneﬁts will tricke down to the less
important cells of the economy, the
working individual. Had we given
Nixon a full shot, indeed a double
shot of the bitter elixir he so
vigilantly crusaded for for social
wrongdoers, he may not have been
back on the streets peddling his
goods all over again.

And even 'if some of the
even-handed justice hadn’t trickled
down to the masses, in Nixon’s
case it would have been well worth

5head the new department--a‘
,-combination of the biology, bio-
chemistry, biophysics and micro-
{biology departments, effective
January--has been the victim of
overreaction by the‘TAs, according
to the faculty members.

’_- ‘_‘~‘He’s (Sussman) only been in

biophysics and microbiology pro-
fessor Karin Ihler. “It’s hardly

- The TAs’ major complaint had
been that Sussman spurned input
from them in building the new unit
and neglected to meet with them as
"requested.

“Dr. Sussman was here for four
_ "days before he was hit with the TA

requests,” biology professor Carl
" Partanen said. “Had he been
approached earlier, he would have
probably taken care of the matter.

matter,” said assistant biology‘
professor Robert Raikow, ‘But he
has only been here 11 days.”

The TAs also complained about
Sussman’-s appointment of the
assistant chairman for the life
sciences department without ad-
vice or input from them or faculty
members. Some faculty members
backed Sussman’s method, while
others declined to comment.

“Sussman was justified in
making the appointment of his
assistant by himself,” Partanen
said.

The new assistant chairman,
biochemistry professor Ron Bent-
ley, refused to comment on
Sussman’s communication and
methods of staff selection, fearing
he would “exacerbate the situa-

tion. . ,

Assistant biochemistry professor
Terrence Cooper, currently acting
as information director for Suss-
man, maintains.that the chairman
has done a lot in the short time he’s
been here.

Sussman has scheduled a Sep-
tember 23 meeting with the TAs of
the three merging departments,
according to Bentley and Cooper,
at which they hope the conﬂict will
be resolved.

General Moshe Dayan, former
Israeli defense minister and leader
of Israeli forces during the Six Day
War and the Yom Kippur War, will

Black College Fund
Awards Pitt $15,000

Norman R. Dixon, associate
professor in Pitt’s School of Edu-
cation, was the recent recipient of a
$15,000 grant from the United
Negro College Fund. The grant
supplies funds for doctoral stu-
dents to study the socio-economic
impact and development of grad-
uates from the nation’s black
colleges.

The projected research, to be
conducted by Dixon, seeks to
identify those fields and profes-
sions in which the graduates of
black colleges are under-re'pre-
sented. The graduates’ career
development histories in relation to
their training and aspirations will
be a prime focus of this study.

Although the research will
specifically cover a 10-year period
(1964-1974), it will also relate to a
broader 30-year timespan begin-
ning in 1944, in order to establish a
historical perspective. Based on
the stugly’s ﬁnal collected data, the
researchers will recommend long-
range solutions toward the goals of
equal opportunity and afﬁrmative
action. '

The $15,000 grant stems from
the work and involvement of Dixon
in the field of higher education at

Pitt. Dixon's accomplishments in
pyschometrics and his develop-
ment of the nation’s only course
offering on black colleges have
earned him a position of leadership
in American education.

the cuts, two of the better ones
being “I Keep Forgetting” (inci-'

and “Without a Doubt.”

Brooker’s arrangement of
“Without a Doubt” is especially
good, as he faces his piano off with

tan assortment of trumpets and
saxophones in a tense duel from
which relief is found only in a light,
bouncy chorus.

Two songs on the album that are

somber organ that drones on
monotonously. For those desiring b a 39 .

‘Oaks’ Brings ‘Moody’ Back

BY TOM WASELESKI

From Mighty Oaks.
Ray Thomas, Threshold Records
(THS 16].

This is another album for those
still lamenting the breakup of the
Moody Blues. Ray Thomas had
one of the group’s most character-
istic voices--listen to this and you’ll
recognize it immediately. He wrote
some of the group’s “prettier”

songs: “For My Lady,” “Are You‘

Sitting Comfortably?” and “Nice
to Be Here.”

Though it’s nowhere near the
excellence of the Hayward-Lodge [
(also former Moody Blues] album

. released earlier this year, Thomas

has put together a solid album of
his own that is inferior to old group
efforts but is nonetheless satisfying
to those who await a possible
reuniﬁcation.

Thomas opens with the album's
title cut, an instrumental that you

really couldn’t call a complete
piece. It sounds more like an
introduction, despite, its lush
orchestration.

Thomas has written only one of
the album's songs; all the others
are co-written with Nicky James,
who does backing vocals and
percussion on the record.

“Hey Mama Life” is a good
song; it would be perfect if the
lyrics didn’t try to be so

high-sounding: “...Life is a lonely-.

time for a man who drinks his
whiskey by the jar...” and “...Take
the pride from a man. You’re left
without a meaning...” .

“Love Is the Key” runs pretty
much the same way: “...The earth
is good;why do we abuse it? Our
land, our seas, our sky. Let’s try
our wings and ﬂy...” Are we
supposedto cry or what? The day

Today, even so-called “non-technical” courses
(psych, soc, bus ad, to name 3) require a vari-
ety of technical calculations—-complicated cal-
culations that become a whole lot easier when
you have a powerful pocket calculator.

Not surprisingly, there are quite a few such
calculators around, but ours stand apart, and
ahead. We started it all when we introduced the
world’s first scientific pocket calculator back in
1972, and we’ve shown the way ever since.-

The calculators you see here are our newest,
the first of our second generation.Both offer you
technology you probably won’t find in compet-
itive calculators for some time to come, if ever.

Our HP-21 performs‘ all arithmetic, log and
trig calculations, including rectangular/ polar
conversions and common antilog evaluations.

It’s display is fully formatted, so you can choose
between fixed decimal and scientific notation.

Our HP-25 does all that-—and much, much
more. It’s programmable, which means it can
solve automatically the countless repetitive
problems every science and engineering student
faces.

With an HP-25, you enter the keystrokes
necessary to solve the problem only once.
Thereafter, you just enterthe variables and
press the Run/Stop key for an almost instant
answer accurate to 10 digits.

Before you invest in a lesser machine, by all
means do two things: ask yourinstructors
about the calculations their courses require; and
see for yourself how effortlessly our calculators
handle them. I

Both the HP-21 and HP-25 are almost
certainly on display at your bookstore. If not,

  Respectability

BY RICK STOUF FER
Sports Editor

With the terrible confrontation A

(ie the Pitt-Oklahoma football
game) less than three days away, it
becomes time to assess the game
from the standpoint of the two

 .?:?eams.

From the vantage point of the
Sooners, they have to win this
game. But then it would be more
exact to say Oklahoma must win all
its games this year. After all, it is
considered the number-one team in
the nation and is picked by many to
be the national champions at the
close of the season.

In fact, the Sooners are playing
the role of the fast gunslinger who
must take on all challengers who
come into town and -must beat them
handﬂy.

In their first test--using the word
“test" rather loosely--the Norman

.’.,,..-.geople did just what they were

«supposed to and crushed out-

classed Oregon 62-7. Not bad for
opening the season.

Head Coach Barry Switzer has
never lost a game as Big Man On
Campus [BMOC] [29-0-1, counting
Oregon], and every game except
for perhaps three or four have been
by astronomical scores such as 62-0
or 58-7. It’s not because Switzer is
some kind of high-scoring, . make-
your-opponent-squirm kind of
coach. The truth is that even the

‘second string at OU is strong

enough-to take on many teams on
the Sooner schedule.

The pressure is on for Oklahoma
while for the Pitt Panthers and
Head Coach Johnny Majors it is
more a “give a respectable

.4’”?;~how'ing" type of attitude. No one,
._, .

at least anyone with more than

marbles in his cranium, is telling
Ol’.Iohn to go on out to Norman and
destroy a definite powerhouse
football team while 63,000 parti-
sans sit around in their custom-
made red cowboy hats, boots,
shirts and pants, waving large
crimson-coplored towels in the air.

-No,-cthe-'--rnood 'aroun‘d‘the Pitt =

campus is.do your best and play
with all you’ve got. After all, Pitt
has nothing to lose and EVERY-
THING to. gain from an upset.

A win would vault the Panthers
into the top ten without any
problem and possibly into the big
five." " A _ I ‘

Even the so-called respectable
score--somewhere between losing
by one point and losing by
21--could help the Panthers in the
ratings game. Look at it this way.
Most teams Oklahoma plays,
except for Nebraska or on rare
occasions Oklahoma State, get
beaten by an average of 50 points,
or so it seems. By keeping the
score low, the Panthers will have
succeeded in shutting down one of
the nation's. true offensive Big
Boys. - '

No matter which player one asks
about the Norman Encounter, he
talks about the “on a certain day
anything can happen on a field“
way of thinking. This is exactly the
way they--the players--should be
thinking. The task does look bigger
than any in the past, but as a
Pittsburgh radio personality says
more times than one cares to
remember, “The more you win the
closer you come to losing." ,
Oklahoma’s time may be near. -

September 20 will be a big day in
Pitt football. All one can ask of the

50 or so men who will play is, “Be '

respectable." .

The‘ fact that Saturday’s game
against Oklahoma will be no
ordinary affair had been estab-
lished prior to the weekly press
luncheon at the Greentree Holiday
Inn yesterday. But if it needed any
further clarification, Coaches
Johnny Majors and Jackie Sherrill
certainly provided it.

As Sherrill discussed the Sooner
personnel one by one, one got the
distinct impression that what Pitt
is facing this weekend is not a
football team, but a navy, an army
and an air force all rolled into one.

“Steve Davis (the quarterback)
is what makes Oklahoma’s offense
go,” Sherrill began. “He makes
excellent decisions in pitching the
ball at the right time. p

“Joe Washington (the tailback)
is the best back I've seen in a long
time as far as being able to run and
stop on a dime and go eastand
west.

“Tinker Owens, [the wide
receiver] has dropped one pass in
four years.

“Oklahoma is much further
advanced than anybody else who
runs the wishbone. '

“On defense,

Wednesday,-September--177“, 2975-1-‘HE*PITT-NEWS¢Paget9L:. 

Switer Ready for Shootout

(right tackle) is the best defensive
tackle in the last 10 years in college
football.” .

Sherrill was one of four Panther
coaches who scouted Oklahoma in
its first win of the season against
Oregon. In that game, Oklahoma
amassed 33 first downs and 617
yards of total offensive yards.
Washington carried the ball just
seven times.

Majors was impressed with the
Sooners, to be sure, but he is
leading his troops into the game
believing they can compete with
the Sooners.

“I don’t think Oregon was a
strong football team,” Majors
began rather calmly. “They
fumbled the ball 10 times and lost

seven of them,” he noted. Then
his voice became more insistent.

“We have to approach this game
realistically. Oklahoma is better
now than Southern California was
last year when we played them, in
my opinion. They’re an experien-
ced team and we’re going to go into
the game with respect.”

As Majors’ voice became louder,
he made a few things perfectly
clear.

“Those Oklahoma fans want
blood; a victory isn’t enough for
them. Like the story about the guy
laughing all the way to the bank,
they laugh all the way to the polls.
We’re going into the game looking
to win. We’re not going.to be
over-awed against them. Whether
we lose 7-0 or win 7-0 or lose 37-0
or win 37-0, we’re going to come
back with our heads up.”

On hand by way of telephone was
the Oklahoma coach, Barry Swit-
zer, who must have had a crying

Boyd Runs With

BY- RALPH SPARKLE

If you had to describe Mel Boyd
in one word it would have to be
consistent. Consistently good
would be more like it. Then add a
highly, competitive spirit, a lot of
dedication and concentration, and
you have the ingredients that make
Boyd a successful athlete.

In high school Boyd was
All-WPIAL in three sports: track,"
basketball and cross country. His
track achievements included
WPIAL runner-up once and champ

twice in the two mile. Boyd had

three fine showings at the State
Championships in the two mile. He.
was runner-up his junior year, and
in his senior year he won and-still
holds the meet record.

Boyd also made three trips to the ’

state meet for cross country, where
he ﬁnished eleventh. first and
second respectively.

Considering Boyd’s numerous
treks to the State Championships,
it's no wonder that many schools
wanted --him. But some colleges
-wanted him for his talents that led
Ringgold to the WPIAL Basketball
Championship.

When asked about his decision,
he commented, “I’m only 5’8” and
that is not exactly college basket-
ball height.“ Why take the chance
and sit on the bench.when I ca.
run and prove 'my abilities? Sure
there’s not the fansin track or cross
country like there is in basketball,’
but I like to run and I feel that I
made the right decision."‘,

Head Coach Mike Agostinella
would be the first to agree. “Mel is
a leader. an example for the others
on the team. He is always there
with that extra effort. lt's,always
100% with Mel."

Last year as a freshman, Boyd
proved he could compete on the
college level. He ﬁnished well in
every dual meet and ﬁnished the
cross-country season with a superb
race at the Eastern Champion-
ships.

Boyd’s track performances are
not to go unnoticed. Agostinella,‘
commentingon his 4:1l- mile and
9:02 two-mile, said “Boyd is like a

shark. He has‘a quiet nature but

really shows his teeth for the meat.

When he gscnses an . opponent is

- knowing your

‘a struggling he goesafter him.”

‘Boyd atttributes his success to

concentration. ‘‘I just like being in

shape. It's a personal achievement
body is like a
perfectly tuned machine. A good
coach-athlete relationship is essen-
tial but most important is the
concentration. If a runner can keep
his concentration throughout»:-the’
race, he'll reach his maximum
potential." ' -

but not Boyd. He enjoys running

Charge for Admission     

BY RON SIEGEL

“These kids don’t know how
‘good they’ve had it,” said
Assistant Vice Chancellor William
Markus in reference to the seating
situation at Pitt football games.
Two independent surveys, one
taken by the Pitt News, substan-
tiate Markus’ statement.

Herb Smith, student affairs
coordinator for athletics, surveyed
11 schools with major football
programs. Seven of these schools
charge students admission to
games. In this category are
Indiana, Iowa, Michigan State,
Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio State
and Syracuse.

The Pitt News surveyed the 11
schools on Pitt's schedule this
season and discovered that nine of
the schools charge students admis-
sion, either in athletic fees» or on a
per ticket basis.

Here is a rundown of the policies
of Pitt’s opponents: *

advance.

THE PITT SITUATION: None of
the student activity fee goes
towards athletics. Prior to this
season, any student who showed an
ID was admitted free. This year,
students must exchange a free
color-coded coupon for a free game‘
ticket, andirun the risk of getting
shut out of one or two games.

The major drawback of Pitt’s
plan seems to be that the student
who is willing to pay if he wants to
see a big game [eg Notre Dame]
will be unable to do so.

Except for schools like Okla-
homa, where a substantial contri-
bution is a prerequisite to bu-ying a
season ticket, all schools surveyed
that charge admission to students
assure every student a seat.

A committee is being organized
at Pitt that will plan long-term
student ticket policies. As of now,
there has been absolutely no
announcement of any plans to
charge students admission to Pitt
athletic events.- .

OUTSIDE the 412 area:

Dial “O” + the area code + the number.

Also, remember that dial-direct rates apply on all calls within
the continental U.S. (except Alaska) completed without operator
assistance. They also apply on calls placed with an operator
where direct dialing facilities are not available. They do not
apply to person-to-person, coin, hotel guest, credit card, collect
calls or calls charged to another number because an operator

must assist on such calls.

Oklahoma
No Worry
For Taylor

BY STEVE SYBERT

Remember when the town bully
used to knock you down and take
your cap and kick dirt all over you?
And remember you used to swear
to get ~even_when you grew up?

Well, Oklahoma is bullying its
way around the college football
scene these days and come
Saturday will try to make Pitt its
next victim. But the Panthers have
grown up. Yes, it’s the Panthers
who have come of age and the

bullies who had better watch out. ff -2

Pitt sophomore split end Willie
Taylor is one player who believes
the Sooners and better watch out if
they try to pick on the maturing
Panthers. I I

“They’re number one in the
country and Pitt is just now getting
started,” he said. “People don’t‘

‘Buffalo Back’
Helped Settle
Wild Frontier

(‘Continued from Page 

Obviously, it didn’t happen that
way. The Ghost Dance was
doomed to failure from the start in

that respect. What the dance did,

do, Lott does not seem to suspect:
The dance actually helped the
Western ‘Indians accept the advent
of white men and the settling of the
frontier.

Despite his failure to recognize

the real purpose of the Ghost

‘Dance, Lott has written a reason-

ably informative novel that gives at
least ‘a partial’ glimpse of the real

‘American Indians.

To Willie Taylor:

‘DU Just Another Game’

(Continued from Page 10)

The word being passed around
this year about Oklahoma is
“awesome.” The Sooners have
won 20 games in a row and have
gone 29 games without a loss.
There appears to be no end to the
streaks in sight. Last year,
Oklahoma led the nation in three
offensive categories--rushing, scor-
ing and total yards. Running back
Joe Washington was chieﬂy res-
ponsible and is ready for a repeat
performance this season. j

“Sure they’ve got the backs,”
Taylor said. “But we’ve got the
backs, too, and I think we’ve got
the better backs. Dorsett is better
then Washington.”

Maybe so. But what about the
Sooner defense, also rated as one

of the finest in the country?

“They have to prove themselves
to me,” Tayloraffirmed. “I’m not
going out there scared. They are
just as human as I am.”

Taylor already is looking past
Oklahoma, all the way to Notre
Dame and Penn State, two of the
other bullies who will invade Pitt
Stadium in November.

“I felt we should have beaten‘

both Notre Dame and Penn State
last year,” he said. “The breaks
just didn’t go our way. I think this
is the year we beat both of them.”

Taylor may be thinking big for
being so new to the varsity scene.
Yet as a junior varsity player,
Willie led the young Cats to a 4-0

record, grabbing 25 passes for 439-

yards and 6 touchdowns. But he

feels ‘playing varsity is a whole new

ballgame. »
