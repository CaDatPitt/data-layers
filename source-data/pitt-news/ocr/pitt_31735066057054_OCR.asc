Fighting AIDS at Pitt

SGB and PATF join together against AIDS

By Rebecca Baker
Staff Writer _

By blowing up a condom and smear-
ing it with hand lotion, Donald Ainslie
from the Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force
started off last night’s AIDS seminar.

Ainslie, a Pitt philosophy graduate,
explained the definition of each initial
in HIV (Human Immunodeficiency
Virus) and AIDS (Acquired
Immunodeficiency Syndrome) at the
Student Government Board—sponsored
event.

“The difference between HIV and
AIDS is that the syndrome is actually a
particular set of diseases, while the
virus is just in the blood,” he said.
“AIDS has just been redefined. Until
recently, AIDS was just a list of infec-
tions, made in Atlanta in the mid-’80s.”

Pitt profs 
speak out 
for Cuba

By Rachael DeVine
Staff Writer

The democracy of the
United States was in question
at a meeting in the Public
Health building last night.

Speakers voiced their opin-
ions on the 50-year embargo
the United States has had on
Cuba.

“If we are a free—t»rade
democracy, why has our
nation stopped other coun-
tries wanting to trade with
Cuba?” Pitt law Professor
Jules Lobel asked last night ,
in the Graduate School of 7‘
Health building.

Lobel was referring to the
Torcelli Bill, which prohibits
trade with Cuba and has also
put sanctions on other coun-
tries stopping their trade
with Cuba.

“The United States may
have been able to argue with
a straight face that the Cuban
embargo was a national
security defense in 1991, but
with the fall of the Soviet
Union, Cuba cannot be said
to be a surrogate of the
Soviet Union,” Lobel said.

Pitt Spanish Professor John
Beverly said the embargo has
cost the Cuba $50 billion
since 1960.

“If the U.S. wants to col-
lapse the Cuban economy
and affect the lives of 10 mil-
lion Cubans, then we better
expect two-and-a-half mil-
lion Cubans in the United
States because of family rela-

Ainslie said that now AIDS is deter-
mined if the person’s T—cell level is
below a specific number, because a lot
of government programs won’t fund
health care unless a person actually
has AIDS.

He recommended that people get
anonymous AIDS tests if they want or
need to know if they have the HIV
virus because insurance companies
might hold an AIDS test on a doctor’s
record against a client. ’

“Even confidential testing at a clinic
isn’t guaranteed,” he said.

Anonymous testing is only available
at the Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force on a
trial basis, due to a local government
official who Ainslie said‘ wants to abol-
ish anonymous testing.

“AIDS is a cutting-edge virus in a
depressing sort of sense,” Ainslie said.

 

“If it had to come, it came at the right
time since we didn’t know much about
the detailed workings of the immune
system before the 1980s.”

While HIV can be transmitted by
unprotected sex, Ainslie warned about
needle use in tattoo parlors and steroid
use among athletes.

“Bloody fist fights are pretty unlikely
to be a cause of transmission,” Ainslie
said. “Because the blood is leaving the
body rather than going in.”

Ainslie led some members of the
audience in “condom playing” in which
he gave students signs with 12 separate
instructions on how to put on a con-
dom and had theinrearrange them-
selves in the proper order of use.

“The age of innocence is over,”
Ainslie said. “HIV is hereand we’re
going to have to deal with it.”

Controlling rage through positive action

A nger can have positive
aspects. An angry
response to an assault, for
example, can help us to
mobilize an effective
defense. Too often, however,
out-of-control anger can have
devastating effects. Much of
the violence that occurs in
our society is a direct result
of rage. Anger, when it
becomes chronic, can also
lead to hypertension, heart
disease and other health
problems. .

On a more optimistic note,
however, anger can be con-
trolled. Research has demon-
strated that anger ‘in some
people gets triggered more
easily when they are sleep
deprived, physically fatigued
or even over-saturated with
sugar. Rearranging sleeping
habits, getting more physical-
ly fit _or diet modification can
reduce the anger threshold in
a number of people.

We also know that the way
people tend to think about
things can contribute to their
angry feelings. Anger is often

created by a perception of
external threat or provoca-
tion, or by someone behav-
ing in ways that are different
from our expectations. If we
are in the habit of viewing
inadvertent slights against us
as intentional or premeditat-
ed we are likely to be primed
to respond with excessive

control. Make notes about
what it was about each inci-
dent that triggered you angry
response. Think about the
feelings and thoughts you
had at the time and some
alternative ways you might
have thought about or
restructured the situation in
ways that were less upset-

progress will also help.

There are other ways of
addressing the problem.
Anger problems might be
contained, for example, by
becoming more aware of
your basic fears (since anger
is often rooted in fear), learn-
ing relaxation techniques or
learning to get more of what
you want out of life by
asserting yourself appropri-
ately.

There are books in
the library or bookstore
that can provide more
detailed tips on controlling
anger, or, for some people,
professional counseling
might be a solution.

need to know that you can

a complicated problem, and
for significant changes to
occur a determined effort
over an extended period of
time will be necessary. It is
an effort, however, that if
successful, will have life long
benefits. .

EVERY FRIDAY AT Spm Crab Le s served with butter

To the University Community:

. On April 7, 1993, The Pittsburgh Stop, Inc. celebrates its 4th anniversary. This 4th year has turned into a very special
year. After starting out with 4 sweatshirts in a box, and putting that box into the trunk of my car, The Pittsburgh Stop, Inc.

now has the largest selection of Pitt items in the world. After visiting many college bookstores around the country and V

comparing prices to our famous $9 -100% pre-shrunk heavyweight t—shirts and "our 3529- 12 oz. Lee Cross Grain
heavyweight sweatshirts, our prices arenot only the best in Oakland, but also around the country. Our everyday low prices
are lower than our local competitors 20% off prices. ’

But what makes this year special is that the class of ‘93 has grown with us. I remember freshman orientation in ‘89,
passing out ﬂiers with the class of ‘93 on them and freshman asking me where the library was and seeing students go to the
wrong building for class, as well as learning to adjust to college life and earning money to pay those large phone bills! Now,
4 years later with lots of hard work and dedication, the class of ‘93 will become the future of our country. Congratulations!

As this class graduates to become leaders of our country, The Pittsburgh Stop, Inc. has graduated from vendor to the only
licensed manufacturer of Pitt paraphernalia on campus.

I am glad to announce that on Feb. 5th, 1993, The Pittsburgh Stop, Inc., along with Shirts Illustrated, Inc., which is owned

and operated by The Pittsburgh Stop, Inc. signed an agreement with the University of Pittsburgh and Collegiate Licensing ‘

Co. This enables Shirts Illustrated, Inc. tolbe a licensed manufacturer of Pitt paraphernalia. This agreement entitles us to put
the Pitt trademarks on all marketable items. We have two professional artists on duty to assure the best artwork and to
upgrade designs annually. The most important aspect is price! As a manufacturer, we can bulk—buy all goods, print and then
sell. This eliminates other printers and saleman’s commissions, guaranteeing the best possible price for years and years to
come.

How more official can you get? A Pittsburgh native, University of Pittsburgh Alumni, Golden Panther, manufacturing Pitt
products in Pittsburgh, and selling them under the shadow of the Cathedral of Learning. Exciting!

To all University students, departments, staff, greek organizations and businesses — we silk screen for all occasions. Our
service is excellent and we deliver — just call 621-7488 for more info.

A special thanks to Chancellor O’Connor, Sr.Vice Chancellor Tucci, Asst.Vice—Chancellor DeVitto and Athletic Director
Oval J aynes for having the honesty and open-minded willingness for resolving past issues and differences and making this
agreement possible. Hail to Pitt!

Last but not least, we would like to thank everyone who supported us the past 4 years, especially the class of ‘93 of whom
many friendships have been made. The bottom line for the class of ‘93 and The Pittsburgh Stop Inc. is perseverance in that

College costs increase

The headline looked encouraging; “College cost rise smallest in 20
years.” But that was the only encouraging sign in what is an otherwise
grim outlook. Costs are increasing and state aid is decreasing. For
those who plan on having kids better start saving now. The cost of a
college education by the year 2000 could be well over $50,000 a year.

Seem impossible? We’re halfway there already. Yale, the posh Ivy
League university located in New Haven, Conn., was the first to break
a barrier that symbolizes the escalating costs associated with a four-
year undergraduate education. T o spend a year studying at Yale
University now costs $25,110. The rest of the Ivy League should reach
that level duringathe 1994-95 school year. .

For the rest of the universities in the United States ——both public
and private — the picture looks frighteningly similar. As surveyed by
The New Yorle Times, tuition increases at Pitt and several other univer-
sities will average around 5 to 6 percent this year. The only good
news is that this years tuition increase is less than the 11 percent of
last year — still more than the 4 percent increase in the inﬂation rate.

Since education by its very deﬁnition is an investment in the future,
the outlook for posterity is not very promising. The question is, how
can we keep these costs from spiraling upwards even further?

The desire to keep tuition costs low will require sacrifice on the part
of everybody —- including students. Students will not be able to
request as many services, university employees will have to accept
pay increases no more than the national inﬂation rate, athletic depart-
ments will have to stop hiring and firing coaches at will and, most
importantly, administrative fat and salaries will have to be trimmed
substantially.

In short, the system of higher education is a microcosm of the fed-
eralgovemment. Dominated by politics, inﬂuenced by special inter-
ests and slowly drifting away from their educational base, universities
and their customers have brought many of these troubles upon them-
selves. It would be wise to utilize the educational resources the uni-
versity possesses to figure out how to bring down costs and maintain
quality instead of researching, for example, the function and purpose
of lentils.

The biggest problem, as with many things in our society today, is
that posterity will have to pay for it. And as fewer and fewer students
attending college, this will be a difficult task to accomplish. The
United States economy is being pulled down because of the actions
of previous administrations. I

Clinton's many Women

With all the struggles and misfrrings that President Clinton has run
into in his first couple of months, in one respect he seems to have

/

kid to his guns: The rights and importance’ of women in society and -
government. '

His numerous appointments of qualiﬁed women to cabinet posts,
while not as many picks as some would have liked, were impressive.
He lifted all abortion rights’ restrictions imposed on women by gov-
ernment and signed the Family Leave Bill.

But more importantly, the image that Clinton portrays is that he
sees the women he interacts with as equals. Some of the women he
has surrounded himself with, like his wife Hillary and Attorney
General Janet Reno, are women with strong images as well as strong
personalities. This is a far cry from Barbara Bush, who spoke softly
and carried a big stick.

Also, the women he picked were people who deserved their jobs.
It was not a matter of token women quotas but getting qualified
women into more positions in government.

Most important is how Clinton treats Hillary, which differs from pre-
vious presidents. He treats her as a partner, an equal who can have a
tremendous impact on his work during his term. That may be as a big
a blow for women’s rights as any in American history.

the little-known governor of

’ Arkansas could win the nomination

of his party, let alone the presidency,
were exceedingly long. Bill Clinton
defied these odds in large part
because he — and the managers of
his campaign — grasped the grow-
ing sense of economic insecurity that
has penetrated middle-class America

- by the ﬁnal year of the Reagan-Bush

era. The Bush people did not appear
to understand this until verylatein
the campaign and when they ﬁnally
did, the president’s frenetic tours
around the country promising “jobs,
jobs, seemed both cynical and
contrived.

The Clinton campaigncapitalized
on middleclass anxieties and offered
a set of conﬂicting suggestions as to
how economic problems would be
addressed. After the election these
ideas took shape in the economic
program currently working its way
— with varied degrees of success —
through Congress. The program
incorporates three crucial proposi-
tions about promoting recovery and
growth in the short to medium rurr

First, it is held, some credible steps
must be taken to reduce the deﬁcit,
and these cannot consist of spending
cuts alone. This part of the program
appears to have cleared Congress,
though after 10 years of failed pro-

grams to control the deﬁcit its eliicacy

remains open to question.

Second, a short-term stimulus
package is seen as needed to deal
with the changes in the economy
attendantto the reduction of our mili-
tary budget and the apparent malaise
in consumer confidence that has
characterized the past year. ,

Third, some program to deal with
the rapid run—up of medical costs and
their impact on the economy is seen
as a prerequisite of any attempt to
control the federal deﬁcit

The stimulus package is the cur-
rent point of contention between
congressional Republicans, who
seem to have a “cloture proof’
minority in the Senate, and the
Clintonites, who feel the package is
crucial to restoring conﬁdence and
offsetting further shocks to employ-

ment that will inevitably come ﬁom
reductions in defense and further
downsizing expected in a number of
large corporations. What economic
reasoning lies behind the debate —
and there doesn’t appear to be very
much — pits Neo—Keynesian propo-
sitions about economic stimulus with
the Neo-Coolidge macroeconomics
that came into fashion in the 19805.
Neither side seems to “get it” when it
comes to analyzing the changes that
may underlie middle-class anxiety

about the future.

Overiooked inithe debate are two
aspects of recent economic growth
that need to be further examined.
Neither is primarily “rnacroeconom-
ic.” The ﬁrst involves the implications
of increasingly free trade with a
world where many of our trading

partners are relatively “labor plenti- 

ful.” Economic theory holds that in
such cases free trade may, on bal-
ance, be beneﬁcial to a 1abor—scaroe,
high—wage economy, but that it may
be accompanied by reductions in
real wages. Clearly, increasing inte-
gration of I a world economy where
serni-skilled and even highly skilled
services can be provided in low-
wage areas will have a significant
impact on relative wages. When
computer programmers in Calcutta
can provide services directly via E-
mailtoﬁrmsinNewYork, therela—
tive wages and employment oppor-
tunities of programmers in both
places will be affected.

Second, there is the suggestion
that new technology in business has
been labor saving in the ranks of
middle management —— where
many college graduates in the United
States have traditionally sought
employment The increased weight
of white collar unemployment and
the hostile job environment with
which graduating college seniors are
all too familiar appear to be more
than the result of a temporary and
apparently mild downturn in the
maaoeconomy, and this impression

is reinforced by the worsening of the
U.S. income distribution observed
throughout the 19805..

If the worsening income distribu-
tion and the persistence of unem-
ployment are due to “structural”
causes such as those suggested
above, the Clinton stimulus package
may miss the point of the problem.
While a shot of construction work on
roads and bridges may offer some
relief, it will not address the problems
involved in reallocating labor from
military and defense to other uses
and fromdeclining sectors to ones
that may potentially grow. Nor will it
address the impact on income distri-
bution of substantial declines in the
earning power of various groups of
workers.

Economists have had relatively lit-
tle to say about such problems and
they need to address them more sys-
tematically‘. In the meantime,
Clinton’s advisors would do well to
examine the adverse impact of plac-
ing more costs directly on providers
of employment — such as  or
play” funding. of medical insurance.
The use of broader-based taxes on
sales, or value added, or even on
trade ﬂows to cover costs of adjust-
ment needs to be explored

Such changes appear to be pre-
cluded because of a gridlock that
stems not from Congress but from
the electorate itself. For over a
decade, voters have appeared
unwilling to tolerate either substantial
cuts in expenditures or increases in
taxes, let alone consideration of how
tax andspending structures might be
changed to enhance economic per-
formance. The voters have received
very little political leadership in this
area beyond such slogans as “read
my lips”. We need to consider the
long-run US. record more carefully.
Of the G—7 nations (the large industri-
al market economies) we have the
lowest ration of total taxes to national
income. And over the 25 years ﬁom
1965 to 1990 we also have have the
lowest rate of per capita economic
growth.

Johnny Majors has made a career of rebuilding football programs.

By Cory Walborn

Senior Staff‘ Writer

Among the rolling hills of Tennessee, Shirley

mer Tennessee Coach Bowden Wyatt as the two
most inﬂuential people in his coaching success.
“My father was a builder,” Majors said. “My dad

coached a team at Huntland and they improved.”

Majors once coached a high school football team.

At Huntland High, he mowed the field, taped the
players and constructed a winning football team in
the process.

-After going_3-5 in his first season, Shirley Majors,

only lost one game in the next 13 years. He was a
builder of success. And so was one of his players —
his son, John.

Johnny Majors, Pitt’s new head coach and retum-
ing legend, has a big reconstruction job ahead of him
as he looks at Pitt’s football future. It’s nothing new.
The hard hat has been passed from one generation
to the next, turning every building job Majors has
had into a success.

“Because I was coached by builders,” Majors said,
referring to his success over the past three decades,

The amazing 73-6-1 record at Huntland was more
than just an improvement, it was a secret to the
younger Majors’ success.

“He [Majors’ father] taught us how to be disci-
plined, he taught us how to get in condition,” Majors
said. “He was hard-nosed, but once you made the
team and fought, he treated you like a person.

“He taught [the players] how to hustle and play as
a team.” '

Playing as a team is something Majors has learned
and will stress to his Pitt players. Majors also learned
plenty while attending the University of Tennessee.

Leading the Volunteers to a 10-0 record in 1956,
Majors was inﬂuenced by yet another builder, Wyatt.

“He was a dynamic individual, he was like my
father,” Majors said. “They were very similar in

“I learned from the best.”

Majors referred to his late father, Shirley, and for-

approach.

Men's tennis routs Youngstown St.

By Jason Brame
Staff Writer

Pitt’s men’s tennis team ran all
over‘ the Youngstown St.
Penguins 7-2 yesterday at an
afternoon match at the Cost
Center.

The Panthers rolled to their
third win in their last four games
and improved their overall record
to an impressive 9-5.

“We’re beginning to peak,” Pitt
head coach George Dieffenbach
said. “The team has gained a lot
of momentum, and individually
each member is really progress-
ing and is really on the right
schedule. With their improve-
ment, they’re getting ready for
their last three matches of the year
getting down to the Big East
Championship.”

Scott Smith, Pitt’s No. 1 seed,
lost his first match of the game, a
6-1, 6-1 decision to Penguin Bob
Taylor.

“Scott Smith played a very fine
player,” Dieffenbach said. “You
can’t take anything away from his
opponent, his opponent played

very well. Scott made a lot of
good shots but his opponent was

. just very strong.”

Alex Cobbold garnered Pitt’s
first victory, a 6-4, 6-2 thrashing
over George Laskos. James
Chronister followed with a 6-5, 6-
1 win over Youngstown St.’s
Vinnie Marino.

“Alex is gaining a lot of conﬁ-
dence and a lot of rhythm
towards the end of the season,”
Dieffenbach said. “This is his last
year — his senior year —— and
he’s making some big contribu-
tions.”

The bottom half of the order
was perfect for Pitt, with seeds
four, five and six all winning.

Jeff Campbell beat Dan Salcedo
6-0, 6-2. Effrum Garnett defeated
his opponent 6-4, 65, and David
Dumpel beat Jon Bobounir 6-1, 6-
0.

“Once again, our depth pulled
us through,” Dieffenbach said.
“To not lose a set playing two
through six singles is a real
accomplishment.”

In doubles, the Panthers went
undefeated, as Cobbold and

Dumpel won 8-6 over Taylor and
Laskos. Smith and Kevin
Sambuchino won 8-3 over Marino
and Salcedo, and Scott Alexander
and Anirban Mukheijee won 8-5
over the Youngstown St. duo.

The win was their second in a
row and third in the past six days.
After thrashing St. Francis 9-0, the
Panthers fell to the Nittany Lions
of Penn St. 7-0.‘ The team
rebounded to defeat Edinboro 7-2
to run their record to 8-4 before
yesterdays victory.

“Against Edinboro, that was
really the turning point of our sea-
son,” Dieffenbach said. “There’s a
team that’s played real strong
against us the past five or six
years. The team played real, real
tough.” _ .

“Pretty much the whole team
dominated St. Francis,”
Dieffenbach said. “In the Penn
State match -—- they’re a real
strong team and it was a good
experience to play them, but we
put up good fights in every one of
those matches. Oftentirnes in ten-
nis you learn more from a loss
than a win.”

Orioles to dethrone '
weakened Blue Jays

Byjason Hillman
Editor in Chief

What a difference a couple of years makes.

In the past, the American league East was considered by many
to be the worst division in baseball. Four, possibly five AL West
teams were considered better than any East team.

Now the AL East is probably the best division in baseball, with
at least four contenders battling for the pennant.

One of the reasons that the division is having such a turnaround
is the strong starting pitching that many of the teams have devel-
oped or traded for. Mike Mussina, Cal Eldred, Juan Guzman,
Melido Perez, Jim Abbott and Charles Nagy are examples of that
pitching.

The Baltimore Orioles made the most improvements over the
offseason. The acquisitions of Harold Reynolds and Harold Baines
shore up weaknesses in the Orioles’ lineup. Beyond trades, the
emergence of Arthur Rhodes (7-5, 3.63 ERA) as a fourth starter
and the prospect of Glenn Davis finally having the year he’s capa-

' ble of are what push the Orioles to the top of the division. Even

the perennial wash-up Fernando Valenzuela has joined the party.

As it stands, the starting rotation is the weak point of the club.
Mussina anchors the staff while aging Rick Sutclilfe is a solid, if
uninspiring, pitcher, and Ben McDonald is a completely unde-
pendable super-talent. The relief pitching may be the best in the
league, with stud Gregg Olson as the closer and Alan Mills, Mark
Williamson and Todd Frohwirth as the set-up men.

There seem to be no weaknesses in the lineup, with the excep-
tion of right ﬁeld, and the one thing that the Orioles have kept
from their less hopeful years is a strong defense. With all these
weapons, this team is the one to beat.

Repeat has to be in the minds of the Toronto Blue Jays.
However, the team lost many of its best players before the start of
the season. Dave Winﬁeld (with his 108 RBIs), Kelly Gruber,
Candy Maldonado, T om Henke, Manuel Lee, Jimmy Key and
David Cone are gone. Of course, Cone wasn’t with the team for
long, but he would have been a tremendous asset.

Their replacements(?) -—- Dave Stewart (out for the first six
weeks of the season), Paul Molitor, Dick Schofreld and Darrin
Jackson —— cannot match the losses, although Molitor and Jackson
are good players.

The pitching is still strong but not as strong as last year. Stewarfs
injury makes him a question mark for the entire year. Jack Mom's
is aging, Guzman and Todd Stottlemyre have had injury problems
surrounding their phenomenal performances. Although the two-
three-four spots of Roberto Alomar, Molitor and Joe Carter are
untouchable, the fact that Devon White (.303 on—base average)
leads off for this team could spell an October vacation for the Jays.

Steinbrenner is back and a new and improved New York
Yankee team is waiting in Yankee Stadium. ‘Abbott, Key, Wade
Boggs and Paul O’Neill are some of the pieces that should fit in
well on the team.

The comers have two potential Hall of Famers in Boggs and
Mattingly, but the Yankees’ real strength is their starting pitching.
Key, Abbott and Perez (2.87 ERA, 218 strikeouts) are the studs,
and young talent Sam Militello and Bob Wickman fill in nicely as
fourth and fifth starters.

The talent isn’t quite enough to win this division but the Boss
could make some moves and take this team to the top. Or the bot-
tom.

The Milwaukee Brewers surprised many people with the
strong challenge they gave to the Blue Jays last year —— pushing
them to the last week of the season and finishing only four games
back. A combination of blurring speed and strong pitching made
the team contenders.

Unfortunately, the best pitcher late in the season, Chris Bosio
went to the Mariners, and the best hitter, Paul Molitor, went to the
Blue Jays. But the team still has speed at the top of the lineup (Pat
Listach, Darryl Harrrilton) and the pitching is still good, with Bill
Wegman, Jaime Navarro, Cal Eldred and promising youngster
Ricky Bones.

This team has talent, no doubt, but probably lost too much to
beat out the other improved teams in this division. They could
surprise, though.

Disaster follows the Cleveland Indians like a well—trained
puppy. Burdened with one of the league’s most pathetic histories,
it is easy to feel sorry for this team. The tragedy of the deaths of
Tim Crews and Steve Olin was emotionally devastating and Olin
was one of the best young closers in the game. Now the Indians
will have to go to a bullpen by committee.

What's so bad about the Seattle sound? Mud ‘N Honey

By Brian Berger

Showcase Editor

Three years ago a friend
and I heard Mudhoney on the
radio. And while I was excit-
ed at the freshness of the
sound, my friend triumphant-
ly boasted “this is why
Pittsburgh music sticks.”
Then he added “and always
will.” He apparently meant
that Mudhoney had more
musical balls than any local
group and, more importantly,
the whole city. He wasn’t a
local boy, ya see.

I’d love to run into him
now and ask him if he thinks
his comment is as dumb now
as it was then. And I’ll bet
Ian Williams’ guitar, drums

and suede Pumas that this g

kid hasn’t slapped on a
Mudhoney song in two years.
Not only did he have a slight
attention span, but he proba-
bly thinks that the band has
sold out because it went from
an Indie label to Reprise’s
semi-large mersh headquar-
ters.

And I’ll bet both of Mike
Shanley’s bands and his jazz
records that this friend has
listened to one of the out-
standing local recordings that
have sprung since he laid his
foul tongue on me. Who he is
isn’t important, what’s impor-
tant is the local music scene,
but even they are on the back
burner for the moment. Ya
see, Mudhoney is finally
coming to Pittsburgh.

Actually, it’s not that
important because their time
has passed. Blown away real-
ly on the freeway of feedback

that propelled Nirvana into
pop tarts for little girls and
made Sonic Youth forget how
to write a decent song. That’s
right, despite their major
record deal, the Seattle four
are baby muppets compared
to Nirvana, laundry for Pearl
Jam (who never got played
on college radio anyway),
ballboys for Alice In Chains
(who are still lapping at
Geezer Butler’s hung bass)
and, ya know what else,
Mudhoney smashes ‘em all.
Yep. Mudhoney rocks the
rock; these punks jock the
jock. Whether it be Black
Sabbath, The Stooges, who-
ever, all these high glossy
MTV pinups owe everything
to Mudhoney. In fairness to
Nirvana (a first) those lads
are dumb enough to admit it.
Ya see, Mudhoney (and the
Melvins, who featured former
Mudhoney players) started
this whole Seattle thing that
provided Spin and Rolling
Stone with covers,
Hollywood with a movie,
fashion with a new (actually
an old) wardrobe and
throngs of youth with a new
form of idolatry.
Two-and—a—half years ago it
appeared that Mudhoney was
done. The group was playing
its last show, at least that’s
what the group said; and for
the moment, we all wanted to
believe it. We were there,
live at the Palladium, NYC. A
swirling pack of whiz kids,
slackers, a real melting pot of
eager white kids. The show
went on forever; they kept
coming out and doing encore

jumped headfirst from the
stage, trying to take the band

members with them. The
group didn’t seem to care this
was its final call, its whoop-
de—do; encores up the ass.
And so it seemed,
Mudhoney lay dormant for
awhile. Vocalist and guitarist
Mark Arm tried a little solo
thing going acoustic and
playing a real bad single on

Sub Pop. But then, the hype
returned. Mudhoney
rejoined, actually it never
broke apart, probably wanted
to test the waters the group
had created a wake in.
Mudhoney signed to Reprise
and delivered Eifery Good
Boy Deserves Fudge. A pretty
damn good record that made
me and others say, “If this is
what the majors are gonna

put out, then I’m with it."
Sonic Youth almost single-
handedly destroyed
novel notion.

It brought back pleasant
memories of the group’s first
single, the massive “Touch

On Dance By Michelle
Staff Writer

Local choreographer and
dancer Ryan Gober will per-
form Stations of the Cross, a
movement meditation, on
Good Friday, April 9, at 5:30
p.m. in the Heinz Chapel.

Stations is an adaptation of
an ancient custom observed by
pilgrims who went to
Jerusalem, who offered prayer
throughout the city in places
associated with the death and
burial of Jesus. Stations of the
Cross or the Way to the Cross is
usually observed during Lent

and Holy week, although many
pray the stations throughout
the year.

The Stations of the Cross are
usually observed by a pilgrim-
age to Jerusalem, but today
many usually go to church.

Gober’s performance is a the-
atrical production of the
ancient liturgy. The 14 stations
are: 1) Jesus is condemned to
death; 2) Jesus accepts the
cross; 3) Jesus falls, 4) Jesus
meets his mother; 5) Simon
helps Jesus; 6) Veronica wipes
Jesus’ face; 7) Jesus falls a sec-
ond time; 8) Jesus speaks to the
women; 9) Jesus falls a third

time; 10) Jesus is stripped; 11)
Jesus is nailed to the cross; 12)
Jesus dies; 15) The body of
Jesus is lowered; and 14) Jesus
is buried.

The 50 minute performance
consists of: 1) Reading from
holy scripture; 2) Meditation
(this is the dance segment of
Gober’s interpretation of each
station); 3) Congregational
Unison Prayer (the audience
may participate in this section);
this three—part pattern is known
as the Benedictine prayer.

Gober created the movement
meditation because he believes
artists should make quality

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, April 8, 1993

works on themes relevant to
contemporary society and
hopes his performances will
“enrich the life of the church
and draw each viewer closer to
God.”

Stations was performed last
year at Heinz Chapel at this
time and Gober said this led to
his “Kairin on the Journey”
being commissioned by the
American Guild of Organists.
Local actor Ben Tatar will nar-
rate, and dancer Bonnie Crosby
will join Gober in the perfor-
mance.

Gober has also taught chil-
dren and adults on art in spiri-

Chapel hosts a special Stations of the Cross, with dance

tual development, written arti-
cles, conducted workshops and
performed dances in churches.
He has created over 55 dances,
teaches at the Dance Alloy
School in Oakland and is an
artist—in-residence in the
Pittsburgh public schools.

Be there Friday at 5:30 in
the Heinz Chapel in Oaleland,
other performances of Stations
are Thursday. April 8, at the
Independent Methodist Church
in New Castle at 7 pm and on
April 9 at the Westminster
Presbyterian Church in Upper
St. Clair at 7:30 p.m.. All per-
formances are free.

bass, Alan on guitar and Brendan O’Malley
on drums. Wliile some claim that this per-
manence solidified the cuts, I‘ll argue that
the spontaics seem drippy over pristine pro-
duction.

No matter really, Witchcraft still possesses
spine-tingling worthiness in many spots.
“Obsessive/Compulsive” recalls “Asking For
It” with Rebeca once more falling within her-
self and expelling another out. “Sleepyhead"
is still more ME, ME, ME. And finally, if
Licht’s instrumentation is your pleasure, “The
Rose is a Thorn” is an epic wallow in the
spirit of Husker Du’s “Recurring Dreams.”

B.O.X. has that start/stop mechanism
inherent in its hook—ful romps that if a lesser
trio performed it, it would be coined
“quirky" (read: “wimpy"). Instead. B.O.X
blows sh-t up with big sound and crazy
angles reminiscent of a less atmospheric
Slintscape or the Boredoms with a mumbling
disorder. One can sense that much Zappa
has been absorbed here as well. Like

its namesake, B.O.X can form Lake Michi-

Mudhoney

Continued from page S-1
about the full-lengther in ‘89
on Sub Pop that landed the
group on MTV with “This
Gift.” just to prove that they
were really good, they blew
open the Spacemen 3’s
“Revolution” on the B side.
Those were some fine days,
indeed.

Now, they got their second
thing out on Reprise, Piece
Of Ca/ee. lt’s simple rock ‘n’
roll without an attitude. It’s a
fun record, with Arm tooling
around with an organ on
some parts and other mem-
bers fiddling with a banjo
and silly crap like that. But,

THE PI'IT NEWS, Thursday, April 8, 1993

when it comes down to
showing Mudhoney can let it
go, the group rips off gems
like “Suck You Dry” and “No
End In Sight.” It’s almost like
the group’s mastered its craft
and can beckon it at will.
Big, slurpy bass lines over an
imposing drum kit, feedback
and healthy riffs of guitar
blasts push the pedals. lt’s a
dirty, metallic blues, dirgy
kind of thing that really
doesn’t sound anything like
that at all.

Arm sounds a bit like
Stephen Tyler if he hadn’t
blown his nose so much. A
scratchy, raspy nasal tone

that is never buried in the
mix. The vocals are always
up front, and you better
believe it’s important. The
kids can’t really stomp if they
can’t sing along. That one kid
(my friend) he really pissed
me off when he said that
Pittsburgh music sucked and
always will. We rock and we
ain‘t stuck up or defensive
about it, neither is
Mudhoney.

Majors
Continued from page 6

“IWyattl was the only
major college coach who
ever won three champi-
onships in three major con-
ferences,” Majors said.

Wyatt won at Wyoming,
Arkansas and Tennessee;
building each program up
from nothing.

“He was a builder, and so
was my dad,” Majors said.
“He was a lot like ‘Bear’
Bryant, and ‘Bear’ Bryant
won everywhere he was.

“I learned from builders.
There is no place for self-
ishness. They worked you
hard in the offseason, dur-
ing the season, they
trimmed the fat off the fat
ones.”

Learning this work ethic,
Majors knows it is the key
to winning. But winning
has not always been on
Majors’ side, he has been
on both the winning and
losing ends of the football
spectrum.

“Back in high school [his
dad was not coaching
then], we were 1-9, so I had
a lot to do with the success
of the team ‘cause I’m the
starting quarterback,”
Majors said. “We got beat
65-7, 75~6, 58-0, 65—7 and
39-7. I’ll never forget those
scores as long as I live
because it was humiliating
and very embarrassing.

“I’ve been on both sides
of the fence,” Majors said. “I
don’t like to lose, but I’ve

been there before.”
Majors has coached at
Iowa State, Pitt and

Tennessee during his head
coaching career and at
each place he has started
on the losing side of the
fence. But after a few years,
he often builds a ladder tall
enough to cross over to the
other side — the winning
side. I

Building that ladder is the
tough part.

“I’m a product of my
background,” Majors said.
“I had great trainers. So that
is what type of coach I am.

“I believe I’m a fighter in
my heart. I believe I am
going to try to instill ﬁght-
ing spirit into the players
and I’m going to try to hire
coaches that can do it just
as well or better than I do.”

Majors said he is proud
of the coaching staff that he
selected and said it is the
most exciting thing he has

done while at Pitt. Building
a new stall‘ is the first step
to success.

“I didn’t come here to
fail,” Majors said. “We have
to build the best team we
can. It’s going to be a pretty
darn good struggle.”

But if it wasn’t a struggle,
Majors wouldn’t be here.
He wouldn’t be putting on
his coaching cap or wear-
ing his whistle around his
neck. He wouldn’t be
building. And that is what

Johnny Majors does best.

threat. But seriously, the total tal-
ent just isn’t there.

A once—proud organization, the
Boston Red Sox is probably the
only team that can be completely
counted out of the pennant race.
They have Roger Clemens and

very little else. Andre Dawson
should have fun in Fenway, which
is suited to his right-handed
power, and Frank Viola is still a
good pitcher, but otherwise this
team is really not even worth talk-
ing about.
