Law Careers Featured

Thomas M. Cooley, dean of the
.Graduate School of Law, will
speak briefly on “Why Study
Law?” this Friday at the school’s
Open House coffee hour.

The main purpose of this meet-
ing, which be-  .» .

Students may report to the

they are free to visit the various

The two classes that will be
opened for auditing by a class on
torts (a civil wrong committed
between individuals, giving one
the right to sue) at 9:50 a.m. in
1409 C1. and a class on contracts,
in the same room, at 2 p.m.

“Lacking an undergraduate pre-
law curriculum,” explained Dr.
Cooley, “many pre-law students
graduate from Pitt without ever
having had ﬁrst hand information
as to what the study of law is
like, what lawyers do, or what
opportunities are in the profes-
sions of law.”

Since there are fewer students
enrolled in law schools through-
out the United States than there
were in 1930, the American Bar
Association fears a possible short-
age in lawyers in the future if
the present trend continues.

Students felt the need for lock-

Sixty percent of the 47 groups
contacted by the Student Library
Committee responded to the
questionnaire.

question concerning s m 0 k i n g

# I1 it
By JIM HUFNAGEL
A small, buff-brick building

1_ squatting between Old Mellon In-

' stitute and the Parking garage on
O’Hara Street houses the Univer-
sity’s atomic cyclotron.

The cyclotron, according to
Bernard L. Cohen, associate pro-
fessor of physics, “is an important
instrument for research in nuclear
physics and has, in the past, been
used for the production of radio-
active isotopes.”

Its function is to accelerate a
deutron (a proton plus a neu-
tron) through a circular mag-
netic ﬁeld. This particle event-
ually reaches a maximum speed
of about 15 mega electron volts,
which is about‘ one eighth the
speed of light. At the height of
its energy cycle the particle is
pulled out of orbit by a highly
charged electron ﬁeld.

The resultant energy is then
used for determining the biological
effects of. radiation, the effects of
radiation on solids, production of
radioactive isotopes, or investiga-
tion of the motion of protons and
neutrons in the nucleus.

3 * 8

“Our high revolution system can
do more precise experiments than
any other cyclotron in its energy
range,” Cohen said.

Construction of, the cyclotron
was begun before World War II
but was not completed until
1948. Three years later it was
modiﬁed to the present high en-
ergy system.

Funds for the cyclotron’s con-
struction and maintenance came
from the University, the Office of
Naval Research, the National Sci-
ence Foundation, and the Air
Force.

It is managed by a four-man
staff: Bernard L. Cohen, Karl S.
Quisenberry and James N. Mc-
Gruer, associate professors of phy-
sics,’ and A. J. Allen, professor of
physics and director in charge of
the cyclotron.

In addition to the managing
staff there is a technical crew
maintaining and operating the cy-
clotron, and a Theoretical Nucler
Physics group comprised of Nor-
man Austern, Elizabeth Barenger
and Robert Drisko, associate pro-
fessors of physics.

All Panther Team

Baseball Team

9 To Open With  

O O
California St.
By ‘JIM O'BRIEN
The Panther baseball team
will unveil its 1961 edition
this Friday at California. Be-
fore any e n v i o u s smirks
emerge, the game is in Penn-

sylvania at the former state

teachers college, not the sunny
fruitland.

Coach Bobby Lewis has been
conducting intra—squad games the
past week, but he has yet to "sand
off ‘the rough '
edges that are
still percept-
ible. The pitch-
ers are still a
little wild, the
batters’ timing
off. and still a
lot of miscues
in the ﬁeld. ‘

“California is .
supposed to be
loaded,” moun-
ed Lewis. “Meanwhile I‘m doing
patchwork just to ‘ieid nine play-
ers. I only have about fifteen boys
eligible for the first game.”

Pitchers Not Ready

“The pitchers aren’t ready yet,
either. They haven’t worked
enough, and I suppose I'll have
to rotate the pitchers a bit. None
of them are ready to go a full
nine innings yet.”

Thus far. Ralph Shutterly,
the only letterman among the
mound staff, appears to be the
likely starter for the opener.
When his wing starts tiring,
Lewis will counter with either
Lauren Guthrie or Frank Ig-
naczak, or, perhaps both.

There are strong rumors circu-
lating that “Corky” C‘uthbert.will
not_ be back at second base this
year. Lewis expected his bad
knee to be healthy enough for
him to play, but “Corky” is leery
about reinjuring it. He would
prefer to have it mend properly
by sitting out the upcoming sea-
son.

  

Lewis

Short on Manpower

If he doesn’t play, Lewis’ prob-
lems will be aggravated. Short on
manpower now, he might have to
play Shutterly at second base un-
til the freshmen become eligible.
As it is, Pete Suder, who has been
tab-bed for first base duties, has
to play shortstop during the early
action, because there are no re-
serves.

The outﬁeld trio of Drew Wil-
liamson, Dave Reeder and John
Ciofﬁ are set, as well as Captain
Jerry Matulevic at third. Bob
New has been given the catching
assignment. Any other plans are
sheer conjecture. -

Visitors Favored

Maryland Starts
Track Saturday

Any hopes Panther track
followers had of seeing their
favorites coast into the out-
door season with an easy win
over a “patsy” are completely
unfounded. Instead of a sec-

ond-rate opponent, the Panthers
face‘ a top-notch Maryland squad
this Saturday at the Stadium, with
action beginning at 12:30.

“I just got a look at the times
they recorded in an indoor meet
with Navy, a team that beat us
during the past season,” said track
coach Carl Rees. “Maybe we
shouldn’t have even scheduled
them.” ‘

It’s not that bad, but the boys
from College Park, Md., broke six
ﬁeld house records in their dual
meet -with the Midshipmen. They
have a .pole vaulter who cleared
14’ 8", two who high jump over
6’ 4", and the IC4A javelin cham-
pion.

In track events, the Terrapins
are strong in the middle dis-
tances-—half-mile, - mile, two-
mile-—-and the relays. They also
boast IC4A high-hurdles king,
Bill Johnson.

But Rees is far from dismayed,
despite his team’s rather disap-
pointing showing during the in-
door season.

We ran against teams that had
scheduled a large number of in-
door meets, but we had only
three,” Rees said. “And we have
quite a few boys that I feel will
do a lot better outside than they
did on the boards.”

These must include Don Ad-
ams, half-miler. Adams has a
bad arch that couldn't take the

sharp turns on an indoor track. ,

Then, too, Rees will be able to
enter such strong men as Vance
Carter, Reed Clarke, Bill Hinch-
berger, and Ed Sherlock in three
events instead of two.

The smooth-striding Carter will
run the 220-yard dash, 440, and
mile relay.

Other Panthers who will be at
l.east even money to cop the spot
in their specialty will be co-cap-
tain Dan Kanell in the shotput and
discus, Sherlock in the high jump,
Ed Vamos in the broad jump, and
Hinchberger or Adams in the half.

The Panther golf team, which

Weeks, comes out into the fresh,

legiate competition. The golfers

Buckeyes.

Weather condtions have cramp-

had much opportunity to evealu—

ate each individual.

Ron Dermitt, Stuart Snod-

sessions, and tentatively make
up the team.

The Buckeyes captain, Jack
Nicklaus, rated as the top amateur

second in the U.S. Open Golf
Tournament.

LUCKY STRIKE PRESENTS:

Ei|R.DRi'F' DD:

on. FROOD'S THOUGHT FOR THE DAY: In College, it
tsn’t who you know that counts-——it’s whom.

   
 
     
 
   
   
   
   
   
   
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
    
           
      
       
     

 
 

Dear Dr. Frood: I just can't seem to
get in step with the rest of the students
here. They enjoy parties, dancing, folk
singing and dating. None of these-
things interest me at all..Am I behind
the times or what?

Left Out

DEAR LEFT: You're in the right times;
you're just one of our squares.

 

Dear Dr. Frood: I have a confession.
All my life I have “been trying to
learn’ how to whistle. I just can't.
Please, will you tell me how to
whistle?

Dear Dr. Frood: Hamlet killed Polo-
nius. Macbeth stabbed Duncan.
Richard murdered his little neph-
ews. Othello strangled Desdemona,
and Titus served Tamora her two
sons in a pie before killing her. Don't
you think this obsession with vio-
lence would make an_ excellent sub-
ject for a term paper?

English Major

DEAR ENGLISH: No, I don't, and my
advice to you is to -stop running
around with that crowd.

Puckered

DEAR PUCKERED: Watch the birds.
Notice how they gather a pocket of ‘
air deep within the breast, then
push thin jets of thisair into the‘
throat, through the larynx, up and
around the curled tongue, and then
bounce the air from the roof of the
mouth o.ut through the teeth (which
act like the keyboard on a piano).
Practice this. In no time your
friends will be amazed at the beau-
tiful, warbly trills that flow from
your beak.

Dear Dr. Frood: What do you think ac- .
counts for the fact that college stu-
dents smoke more Luckies than any
other regular? V
Marketing Student

DEAR MS: Collegiate Lucky smokers. ‘

   
    
 
  
   
 
 
 
 
   
  
  

I

Dear Dr. Frood: My coach is writing this lette
for me because I am illiterate. We want to
know if I got to learn how to read to get into
college. I am the best football player in the
state. X

I: an.’

  

DEAR X: Every college today will insist that
you meet certain basic entrance requirements.
I'm afraid you're just out of luck, X,., unless
you learn how to read diagrams and count to
eleven.

ARE YOU READY FOR THE FLOOD? Most students today live a carefree, devil-may-care
existence-—buying their Luckies day to day. Only a handful have had the good sense to set
aside an emergency cache of three or four Lucky cartons, wrapped in oilskin. When the dam
breaks-—they'll be ready. Will you?_ . -

CHANGE TO LUCKIES and get some taste for a change!
