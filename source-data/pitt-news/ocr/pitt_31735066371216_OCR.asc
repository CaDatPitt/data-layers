Kathy Casey-
For The Pitt News

There is growing evidence that

video display terminals (VDTs) used
at the University of Pittsburgh and
elsewhere may pose health hazards
to those who use them regularly.

VDTs have been linked to severe
eyestrain and irritation, backaches,
stress and in a few cases, miscar-
riages and birth defects. Journalists
and women‘s groups are growing
increasingly concerried over the pos-
sible hazards and are calling on the
government to research VDTs and
their possible side effects.

Digital Electronics Corporation,
which manufactures VDTs used at
Pitt, is conducting studies ofits own.
Jeff Gibson. a spokesman in the
company's public relations depart-
ment at Digital’s Concord, Conn.,

» headquarters, said the company is
studying the VDTs’ effects on vision
and muscular strain.

“We consider ourselves one of the

leaders in ergonomics research into

Digital monitors studies here and ,

abroad and is investigating what
effect seat construction and
operator-to-keyboard distance have
on eyestrain and backaches, Gibson
said.

VDTs’ capacity to serve as elec-
tronic typewriters and word proces-
sors have made them a fixture in
newsrooms across the country. The
Newspaper Guild, a journalistic
union, was prompted to call in" a
government agency to investigate
the machines’ effects on pregnant
workers after a report from Canada
filed by four women that said the

VDTs caused severe birth defects in

their children.

The National Institute for Occu-
pational Safety (NIOSH). prompted
to action by the guild, is currently
conducting research into VDTs’
effects.

Dr. Jane Gordon, head of repro-
ductive studies at the NIOSH Div-
ision of Surveillance, Hazard and
Evaluation Field Studies in Cincin-
nati said her studies will determine if

women who use VDTs regularly are
at a greater risk when pregnant than
those women who do not use the
machines at all. Any definite conclu-
sions are “several years down the
road” because the reproductive stu-
dies are still in the planning stages,
she said.

NIOSH researcher Dr. Michael
Smith ofthe Ergonomics Division is
studying the VDTs’ effects on eye-
strain, backaches and stress. Smith
reports‘ “acute visual “effects” asso-
ciated with VDT use. '

“Between 75 and 80 percent of
those who use VDTs more than one
hour a day suffer fatigue and eye
irritation," Smith said. .

Because these studies are not com-
plete, Smith said he could not deter-
mine if eyestrain found in VDT
operators may lead to serious visual
problems.

The latest NIOSH studies come
on the heels of a study, funded by
NIOSH, by the National Research
Council released last summer. The
Council found VDTs were unlikely
to pose any serious health threats. A
1980 NIOSH report, however,

found “cause for concern" over
VDT-related health risks.
It is this uncertainty in VDT stu-

‘dies that caused the.Newspaper

Guild to request new studies,
according to Kenneth Fisher, secre-
tary of Guild Local 6l at the Pitts-
burgh Post- Gazette.

“Our main concern atthis point is

. that we just don't know,” he said.

“What are the long-term effects of
this? What will we do? What is the
impact ofthis? Wejust don't know.”

The VDTs’ impact on the news-
paper business is the “most dramatic
change for newspapers since the
typewriter," Fisher said. It is for this
reason that Fisher said any health
effects are of primary concern -to
journalists. An estimated l5 million
people, most of them reporters and
clerical workers, will be using VDTs
by 1985.

“Workers will tell you that their
eyes hurt them,“ said Susan Hetz of
the local chapter of 9 to 5, Pitts-
burgh Working Women.

Hetz said her organization is fol-
lowing the VDT research closely,
and she said the hazards have been

‘Friday, February, 10, 19g

downplayed.

“Workers complain of eyestrain,‘
backaches andstress due to the iso-
lation of working on a machine for
hours,” she said.

Hetz said some VDT features, like
adjustable screens, can alleviate
some of the glare involved in eye-
strain, but she added that there are
other facto-rs that cause problems.

“On a lot of terminals, there are
no adjustments, and a lot of them
are pretty noisy,” she said.

Comfort may be important, but

Hetz said that any negative effects‘ ,

VDTs may have on pregnant women
concern her and 9 to 5. She said
VDT problems are not explained,
and it may be “years and years
before we have what can be condi-
dered a partial answer.”

The links between, VDTs and
health hazards have led two states,
Maine and Connecticut, to pass bills
initiating studies on the possible
hazards. Legislation is currently
under consideration in Massachu-
setts, New York, Oregon and Illi-
nois. Pennsylvania, has yet to
introduce any such legislation.

and down a glass of burning plum
brandy.

Where are you? Sarajevo, Yugo-
slavia, site ofthe 1984 Winter Olym-
pics.

“This is not a country which has
been jaded by having too many for-
eigners," said Pitt ass_ociate profes-
sor of political science Dr. Ronald-
Linden.

Linden, who recently spent eight
months in Yugoslavia studying its
reactions to international events,
said the people of Yugoslavia are

' friendly to the point of inviting
strangers home for dinner and a
taste of slivovitz, a potent plum
brandy served repeatedly in small
amounts.

“This is not something you sip
daintily. This is something you
throw down the back of your
throat," Linden said.

of'Bosnia in the Herzegovina region
of Yugoslavia, is noted especially for
its spicy food. A favorite snack is
cevapcici, a small spicy hot dog that
is eaten with kajmak, a type of
cheese sauce. Turkish coffee is also
favored here. Strong like espresso,
yet sweet, this drink is served in
small cups and often accompanies
the slivovitz ritual.

The name Sarajevo comes from
the Turkish word for palace, “saraj,”
‘and it seems appropriate. The town
is dominated by the tall minarets of
the mosques, which are attended by
the town’s Moslem population, esti-
mated at 47 percent.

Linden called Sarajevo “a micro-
cosm of [cultural] Yugoslavia,” con-
taining both Roman Catholic and
Eastern Orthodox churches as well

as being the center for Yugoslavia‘s‘

Jewish population.

Though the people are of diverse
backgrounds, they recently are able
to share one thing in common: the
1984 Winter Olympics.

Because of a housing shortage,
Yugoslavian authorities offered resi-
dents large sums of money to vacate
their homes during the games in
order to accomodate the 30,000
tourists expected daily. An esti-

remaining visitors are being housed i

in the city’s hotels, including Saraje-
vo‘s new Holiday Inn, which report-
edly had a small showdown with a
band of rats —- rumored to be in
town hoping to see the U.S.-Russian
hockey game —— the week before the
Olympics began. '
Athletes will stay in either Olym-
pic Village A, located in Mojmilo
(six km from the city‘s center), or
Olympic Village B, which is situated
at lngam. Olympic Village A con-
sists of 640 apartments, a kitchen
designed to prepare 9,000 meals per
day, a restaurant and assorted game
rooms. Olympic Village B, which
will house cross—country and’ bi-
athlon athletes, has'l64 rooms and
two apartments. Cuif-rent plans are

to convert these villages into hotels
during the post-Olympic period.

Until now, Sarajevo has been
noted primarily as the location of
the assassination of Archduke Fran-
cis Ferdinand. In 1914, 19 year—old
Gavrilo Princip planted his feet
firmly on a Yugoslavian sidewalk
and fired the shot that began World
War 1. Today, those footprints are
i'mm'orta,lized in concrete; Princip is
regarded as a freedom fighter by the
people of his country.

Yugoslavia is among the most
progressive of the Eastern European
socialist nations since it has allowed
foreign. investments. The country,
‘however, is now facing a debt of over
$20 million and high inﬂation. The
flowof foreign money and the build-
ing of a new ski resort sponsored by
such. corporations as Coca-Cola

Olympic facilities should aid in the

country’s financial comeback.

A tavern manager filed com-
plaints yesterday against Pitt
football players Joe McCall, Bill

, Hinton and Darryl Clark in Oak-
l land magistrate Nick Diulus’
office.

The complaint follows an
alleged altercation betwieen
Clark and Hinton and the man-
ager of Peter's Pub.

Bon Bonesso, manager of
Peter’s, is charging that Clark
and Hinton punched and kicked
him several ‘times on Feb. 3 at
5:30 p.m. in the men’s room of
Peter's.

“l was just in going to the

den, l got slammed from
behind," Bonesso said.

McCall had earlier been
barred from Peter’s. according to
Bonesso, and was asked to leave
the bar on the day of the alleged
assault.

Clark said yesterday, “I can’t
say anythingabout it. I can't
speak for Joe [McCall] or Will
[Hinton]. I can admit that l was
there.”

“We’ll see what they say and
go from there."

Head football coach Foge
Fazio was unavailable for com-
ment yesterday. Athletic Direc-
tor Edward Bozik was unaware
that the incident had occurred.

High-tech theft increases,

Pitt compute

By Bob Steen
For The Pitt News

Computer theft is growing on
campuses across the country,
including Pitt's, according to com-
munity relations officer for the cam-
pus police Charles Grier.

One Apple computer, for exam-
ple, has been reported missing from
the Old Engineering Hall. Accord-
ing to assistant director of Public
Safety Walt Watters, the door to
Room 404 was found openjust after
midnight on Jan. 28. Whoever stole
the computer did not break the lock
to enter, and Watters said that it
could be an inside job.

“Many of Pitt‘s computers are
[housed] in older buildings that
weren't made for tight security,”
Watters said. When computers were
larger, they were housed in only a
few locations, but now that compu-
ters are lighter and more portable,
theft cases like this one are common,
he said.

Watters said he would not give
exact figures because such informa-

a.i.___.

tion is confidential.

Grier said there are several meas- _

ures individual departments can
take to reverse this trend.

r stolen

Push-button combination locks
are being installed as part of this

effort. Grier said he encourages the
use of such replacement locks
because they do not require keys,
which means unauthorized persons
cannot gain entrance. In addition,
the combinations can be changed if
there is a break-in and the names of
all employees who know the combi-
nation are registered.

Grier also suggested that depart-
ments record se_r_ial and model
numbers ofall their computers. This
practice makes it difficult _for the
computers to be resold. Watters
said, however, that many thieves
probably keep the computers they
steal for their own use. This makes it
difficult to track the stolen goods
down in pawn shops or on the black
market.

Another preventive measure,
Grier said, is the use of anchor pads,
which lock computers to their
tables.

Following these measures will
help create an effective deterrent
against internal theft. This cam-
paign could be successful with
university—wide cooperation at a
minimal expense, Grier said.

SGB goes on Chariot Race

The Student Government Board recently drew up a proposal
to have an additional campus bus provided by the university to
serve those students moving into the fraternity housing com-

plex in September. The board said that the convenience and
safety of those students warranted the expanded service that
could only be provided by an additional bus.

The university’s offices of public safety and business and
ﬁnance have taken a wait-and-see approach to the idea of an
additional bus, while the board has attempted to forge ahead.

Board member John Geyer said, “It really doesn’t matter
"how much it costs because they are going to havexto do it.”
Sergeant George Lancaster of the parking division of the cam-
pus police responded by suggesting that a survey be taken to
judge the need for the extra bus.

In between those extremes lies the answer to whether a‘/bus is
in fact needed. The failure of both responses is indicative of
why the best-intended plans of this’ and past boards seldom ar
realized. _ A

The administration, on one hand, seems to have decided to
again allow the Student Government Board to spend its ener-
gies needlessly, having already decided against the idea. As we
have seen with the Internship Office, that game can be allowed
to run on for months. p

The board members, on the other hand, have shown a lack of
understanding with such statements of declaration as “they are
going to have to do it." C

1 The board should recognize the university’s tendency to
throw paperwork at every decision and work around it. The

" university should.rediscover the open-minded approach to

problem solving and quit, treating Student Government
members as pets that can be led around by dangling promises in
front of their noses.‘ ’

Right Move Wrong Time

President Reagan's decision to pull the Marines off the
Beirut airfield was a ‘step in the right direction. However, to
couple that commendable move with a nine-hour bombard-
ment of East Beirut was an appalling mistake and a signal that

, although the troops may be withdrawn, U.S. military involve-

ment has not.

The U.S.‘s mission in Beirut has never been made clear,
either tothe public or the Marines. Our intentions there have
been confused, unorganized and counterproductive. Reagan
has failed to understand the important cultural inﬂuences in
the Middle East. His vision of the world as being divided into
evil pro-Soviet agents and God-inspired pro-Americans is
naive and overly simplistic. It is also a major contributor to the
mess we’re in now.

The placing of Marines in Beirut aided in ending the geno-

cide being instituted against civilians who opposed the Phalan- ‘

gist party. Having accomplished this, we then claimed to
support the pro-West Phalangists. Thus, the Phalangists saw
no reason to compromise with the forces they were trying to
extinguish. This was our major mistake in the Lebanese
conflict. -

The U.S. is now left with a Lebanese government that is
about to fall, and we continue to fire on the city we were forced
to leave. These bombs are landing not only on the forces we are
opposed to but on the hillsides where many civilians live.

When the Israeli forces bombed Beirut, America and the
‘American press justly condemned the state for those actions.
The U.S. bombing of Beirut is not far from the actions it
labelled as heinous when Israel committed them.

U.S. military presence in Lebanon has not achieved the
results that would best benefit the region; the war continues. To
increase military tensions and further divide the nation by
bombing Lebanon will only increase the likelihood of an all-
out civil war. The Israeli people were disgusted with the actions

 committed by their leaders and publicly demanded their troops

“Pitt News

writer  
“thoughtless” .

I am writing in regard to an article
which appeared in the Monday,
Feb. 6 edition of The Pitt News.

The article, titled “George Allen
out late, playes tired" by Joe Zeff
was a shining example of irresponsi-
ble journalism and exaggerated gos-
sip. In this piece, Zeff states that he
and other people saw Pitt basketball
player George Allen out on the street
at 1:00 a.m. the morning of the Pitt-
Boston College game. Z f implies
that Allen's late night activity ad-
versely affected his play and contrib-
uted to Pitt’s loss to Boston College.

Did Zeff ever stop to think that
basketball is a team sport and a loss

rests on the shoulders of the team,

not the individual player?‘ I3itt‘s loss
to Boston College ‘was a result of
poor team play, not the play of Allen
alone. i

Did Zeff consider that playing
over 17 minutes of basketball
against a Big East power and
nationally-ranked team tends to
make even the best athlete tired’?

Against Boston College, the entire \

Pitt squad appeared a bit fatigued.
Maybe Mr. Zeff should investigate
the late night activity of all the Pitt
basketball players and "' bring his
findings to the attention of the coach
and the rest of the Pitt population.

I wonder what Mr. Zeff was trying
to accomplish by writing such an
article. Was be trying to remedy
Pitt’s basketball problems? Maybe
Zeff just wanted to expose Allen to
Coach Chipman. Whatever your
motive Mr. Zeff, I have a couple

suggestions for you. First, stick to I

writing real sports articles and if you
must write gossip, I hear Dear Abby
is looking for help. Second, do not
write anything detrimental or poten-
tially detrimental about someone
who is bigger than you, it could
come back to haunt you.

Honor student
defends Honors

This letter is in reply to Professor
Marshall‘s letter of Feb. 3. I suggest,
sir, that if you have angry remarks to
make about either declining minor-
ity enrollment, the honors program
or the university, you be direct with
them. Curt cynicism does little
toward the definition or solutions of
problems.

Was the purpose of your letter to
suggest that minority enrollment is
down becaiise the honors program is
thriving, i.e., the sun rises because
the roostercrows? The two are inde-
pendent phenomenon related by
coincidence, not, I think, by delibe-
rate plan. "

An examination of university
budget, tuition increases and enroll-
ment as a whole would yield more
helpful indicators as to the strength
of the university's commitment to
affirmative action. Suggesting that
the honors program is responsible
for the state of minority enrollment
is patently illogical.

_ Or was the purpose of .your letter
to criticize the attitude of the admin-
istration toward education?
Obviously, there is an unresolved
question as to whether this univer-
sity is a business or an educational
institution, and since no happy
amalgam of the two has yet
appeared, there is more room than
usual behind the scenes for political
baciebiting and general abuse of the
current system.

Energetic and promising students
are as deserving of recruitment,
careful advising and teaching as any
other group of students, and one
function ofthe honors program is to

provide the same. Furthermore, it

. provides a forum for those teachers

excited by the idea of teaching a dif-
ficult or unusual subject to a small
number of capable and interested
students. _
Continued discussion requires
further provocation and is outside
the purview of a reply to your first

letter. There is a final question I
would pose you, Professor Mar-
shall:..Why did you write that letter‘?
Insinuation byjuxtaposition is often
used by angry people with no other
weapon, and I personally would bet-
ter enjoy a more direct debate.

The Pitt News
Enquirer

My roommate and I were
appalled by the obvious attempt of
slander written about George Allen
in the Feb. 6 issue of The Pitt News.
Is The Pitt News really that desper-
ate to fill up space’? What do those
reporters do —— stalk the streets all
hours of the night just waiting to
sling mud at any unsuspecting
person who comes along? And they
call that journalism? Perhaps The
Pitt News should change its name to
The Pitt Enquirer.

If.Ioe Zeff had an ounce ofschool
spirit, he would have realized the
trouble such an article could cause.
Didn't he think that Coach Chip-
man might have imposed a penalty
against Allenupon reading it? Let’s
face it, the basketball team doesn’t
need to cope with any more difficul-
ties. Most important is the factthat
the reporter knew there was no cur-
few set for that particular evening,
yet he proceeded to submit what
amounts to nothing but a libelous
piece of trash. _

My roommate and I, both English
writing majors, have been thinking
about joining The Pitt News staff,
but we don't want to be associated
with this kind of yellowjournalism.
It's a shame; we thought The Pitt

White.House needs woman’s touch I

Many political theorists are say-
ing that the gender gap will be a
pivotal issue in this year’s presiden-
tial election for the first time since
women gained suffrage in l920. Pol-
iticians are beginning to pay atten-
tion to the wants and needs of
women instead ofjust those of the
ma1g;_¥yi_A_S}f§ Iii}; t.h.‘§L_r.w;1ti9o- .L.’ . . .

Women are becoming more polit-
ically aware and active since it is
starting to be quite clear that their
rights are being ignored under the
present system. More attention is
being paid to issues such as repro-
ductive rights. equal pay and the
plight of the poor, including urban

By early January. speculations
were already being made as to the
possibility of a woman vice-
presidential candidate. Several
major candidates in the Democratic
party have not totally ruled out
choosing a woman for their running
mate. although they have yet to

make a serious commitment to such
an idea.

While I would love to see a
woman as vice-president, I do not
think that a candidate who picks a
woman running mate will be a win-
ning candidate. America is just not
ready to accept a female as its vice-
president. -

Americans may like to think of
as progressive and
believing in equality, but that just
isn’t the case. The Equal Rights
Amendment was defeated in I982;
women still only make $.59 for every
$I a man makes, and American
women are still treated like second-
class citizens in this country. This
does not sound like a society that is
ready for a woman vice-president.

Often, women’s worst enemies are
other women. Large numbers of
women came out against the ERA;
the one that most immediately
comes to mind is Saint Phyllis
Schlaﬂy, who saved womanhood for
civilization. Many of these women
came out on the premise of being

anti—choice and were joined by a—

president in the White House who
supported their views. Others just
had conservative views on the rights
and abilities of women.

If women cannot join together as
a force to overcome their inequality,
how are theygoing tojoin forces and

' elect a woman president, let alone a

vice-president?

While women make up over 50
percent of the nation’s population,
only 5 percent of the members of
Congress are women. There’s only a
handful of women governors, and
even in state and local government,
women do not have a great represen-
tation. The Pennsylvania State
Senate has only one female member,
and there are none in the congres-
sional delegation.

Women need to start running for
more offices and making their pres-

ences known and their voices heard
on the local, state and national lev-
els. They have to start small and
work their way up. There are some
women who are under consideration
for vice-president, but if they do not
meet the strong criteria for this com-
plicated age in American politics,
the Americans voters should not and
are not going to accept one.

A women‘s ideological stance
needs to be taken into account. It is
possible to have a Ronald Reagan
mentality inside a woman's body. A
woman like that would be no good
for women’s issues.

Finally, and probably most
importantly, women are still
trapped by prejudices and double
standards that have festered and
grown for hundreds of years. These

prejudices remain in the back of the
minds of many Americans, men and
women alike. The years of condi-
tioning cannot be erased so easily.
" Take, for example, ifthe president
would die or resign and leave a
female vice-president in his place.
Now we all know how emotionally
unstable women are supposed to be,
especially now, with these new dis-
eases like premenstrual syndrome
being discovered. What ifa woman

gets emotionally uspet over some-’

thing trivial like the U.S.’s losing a
hockey game to the Soviets and
decides it’s time to nuke Moscow?

This is the same type of mentality
that believed if John Kennedy were
elected president, the pope would be
sitting in the White House. To deny
the existence of these prejudices
would be unrealistic.

I hope a woman does run for vice-
president this year. Hell, but why
should we only settle for second-
best; we should shoot for the Oval
Office itself.

At least one of George Orwell’is '

predictions have come true: Amer-
ica will be ruled by Big Brother in
1984 instead of Big Sister.

Room 441/Chris Bosso

Well, there he goes again. Just
when you thought it was safe to
turn to the sports pages, Mr.
Reagan springs another doozy
on the unsuspecting public. The
president, in an interview on
ABC’s “Good Morning Amer-
ica,” vigorously denied that his
administration is unfair to the
poor, and, by implication, overly
friendly to the rich.

“What we have found in this
country, and maybe we're more
aware of it now," said Reagan,
“is one problem that we’ve had,

even in the best of times, and
that is that the people who are
sleeping on grates —— the home-

By choice? There you have it:
The homeless hang out on the
streets‘ because they want to, at
least that's what thepresident
appears to be saying. Reagan’s
long-suffering misstatement-

office immediately rushed to the
clarification of this statement
(for which there must be a special
office.)

Spokesman Anson Franklin
argued that the president was

cent of the homeless, acording to
“some studies,” do indeed refuse
aid from governmental and non-
5 governmental agencies. Most of
these recalcitrants, Franklin
added, are “deinstitutionalized”
mental patients, disturbed peo-
ple who, in Reagan’s words,
“have no place to go.” ,

I’ll give the president the
benefit of the doubt about that
25 percent —— for now. But hold
on here. If, by the White House’s
own numbers, 25 percent are

less — are homeless by choice.” 

fighters in the White House press . A

partially correct: some 25 per-

‘...the brieand chab-
lis set have made a

mockery of the so-

called social safety-

9

net. ,

another 75 percent who are not;
There are, in the immortal words
of Ambrose Bierce, “lies, damn
lies, and statistics,” but the
administration’s own statistics
imply by omission that the bulk
of the homeless do not sleep on
steam vents because it reminds
them of summertime in Ber-
muda. He who once stated so
emphatically that “trees cause
more pollution than automo-
biles" — and was elected anyway
— once again betrays his atti-
tudes by his words. I

The Amiable One’s attempt to
deflect criticism of his adminis-
tration’s behavior over the past
three years just won’t wash. Rea-
gan’s cuts in social programs and
tax giveaways for the brie and
chablis set have made a mockery
of the so-called “social safety
net.” \

The “truly needy,” thosel

whom the president vowed to
protect no matter what, are out
on the streets this balmy winter,
joined by the victims of Reaga-
nomics and of David Stockman’s
one-sided budget axe. Most of
these people would rather be in a

warm house, preferably their
own, but they're not. And this
fact, rather than the presidents
glib assertion to the contrary, is
the reality of our times.

Perhaps the poor are with us
always. Perhaps some of our past
social programs failed to alle-
viate hunger and poverty. That is
not the point. A society isjudged
ultimately by how it tries to care
for its least able.

A nation as wealthy as ours
only deserves condemnation for
the current air of mean-
spiritedness, the willingness to

2 turn away from the unkept, the

ill-fed and the un-housed. And,

we no longer even try to address V

these problems. -
In another interview, Mr. Rea-
gan declared that “If there are
individuals who suffer from our
economic programs, they are
people who have been dropped

1 from various things like food-
stamps because they weren’t.
morally eligible for them.” Mor-‘

ally eligible? Now it all makes
sense: you get no government
assistance unless you are of
upstanding moral character.
Fine, morality is a wonderful
thing, but his definition of mor-
ality differs from my own.

Reagan’s rich inherit the earth

0

In the world according to Rea- '

gan, it is the tax—avoiding mil-
lionaires who shall inherit the
earth. The meek will be out on
the streets ———‘ where they evi-
dently belong.

FREUD AND MAN'S‘ SOUL
By Bruno Bettelheim

, Vintage

We are far from understanding the
impact of Freud on our modern
world. But part of the problem lies in
simply figuring out what Freud was
all about. His philosophy is no one
thing, no single doctrine. Rather,
Freud is part of our modernity pre-
cisely because of his multi-
facetedness — a blending of
conservative and radical, of science
and art, of optimism and bleak
despair. ‘

Knowing Freud would mean keep-
ing attuned to all these s'ides, but it
has too often been the inclination of
modern schools of thought to reduce
him — to find in his work only what
they want to find there. And now,
Bruno Bet_telheim’s Freud and Man's
Soul suggests that we may not even
know Freud's words if we read them
in English; Bettelheim’s short book is
a savage study of the ways Anglo-
American thought has already
decided for us the meaning of Freud
by translating him in polemic ways,
giving us not the diversity that is
Freudian thought but, rather, only a
parody more in keeping with the
superficialities of American investi-
gations into the psyche.

Bettelheim argues that Freud's
thought was profoundly concerned
with everyday problems and strove
constantly to create a system of
knowledge that would be open to
many readers. But, as he argues, the
American and English translators
encouraged the erection of psycho-
analysis into ajdomain reserved for
specialists, and so they often trans-
lated simple concepts into more diffi-
cult ones.

Bettelheim suggests that the sum
effect of such translations was to
construct psychoanalysis as a fixed,
rule-bound science rather than an
open—ended exploration that would
continually have to interrogate its
own precepts.

The process that historian Iohn

Seeley has called the "Americaniza-
tion of the Unconscious” too often
took the form of dogma, a freezing of
ideas into unbending laws, and Bet-
telheim is right to show» how this
reduction took place even at the level
of Freud's words. Unfortunately,
Bettelheim then goes on to suggest
that he knows the correct meaning
not only of Freud's words but also of
the concepts for which they stand.
After attacking the limits of interpre-
tation (as he does when he suggests
that Interpretation of Dreams is too
unambiguous a translation of Freud's
title, Die Traumdeutung), Bettelheim
proposes his own interpretation of
Freud.
' For Bettelh-eim, Freud was a philo-
sopher of reason, a defender of
rationality’s powers against the dark-
ness of the unconscious and the
unreasonableness of human drives.
No doubt, there is such an optimist in
Freud — a believer in the conscious
mind's ability to gain control of its
fate through knowledge — but the
other side of Freud — his sense that
no knowledge is final -— is as impor-
tant, and Bettelheim distorts Freud's
power by ignoring this quality.

Frgud_fzj1£I It/‘Ia“n's'S‘0i'4l is a book that



attacks distortion while engaging in a
distortion of its own. Bettelheim has
done Freudian scholarship a great
'service by showing the weaknesses of
translation, and one wishes that his
book had been no more than an enu-
meration of the errors and mistakes.
Unfortunately, Bettelheim’s ambi-
tions are greater, and his understand-
ing is just not up to the task.

AN‘ AMATEUR'S GUIDE TO THE
NIGHT

By Mary Robison

Alfred A. Knopf

In this collection of 13 stories, most‘
of the characters are neurotic and
others are downright crazy, “but all
survive their problems. The stories
engross the reader in watching each

character create his own survival tac- ‘

tics. Robison's characters are often
American family members who expe-
rience minor and major tragedies

_ every day.

In the title story, a teenage girl
copes with high school graduation,
her mother's mental illness and her
father's absence. One would think
that caught between a mother who
imagines spies and conspiracies
behind every bush,and a father who
only writes her, "Happy Graduation,
Good Luck in Your Future,” the girl_
would be a wreck, but like most of
Robison's protagonists, the girl lives
through her problems with matter-
of-fact courage.

In ”The Wellman Twins,” Robison
depicts the ironic situation of a lonely
set of twins. While the sister drinks
too much, the brother writes letters
to an imaginary lover. Like most of
the family members in these stories,
although they love each other
fiercely, their mutual love cannot
assuage their individual pain.

ALI. I3ooI<IiD i

let their children down. In one story,
a young man whose mother died at
birth is upset by his father's decision
to remarry. He goes to his Aunt
Mindy in order to discuss his prob-
lems with "someone more mature.”
But Aunt Mindy has no solutions to
offer him; she drinks until she passes
out on the bathroom floor.

In most stories, little narrative des-
cription, Robison's characters explain
their problems in earthy, simple lan-
guage. In one especially moving
story, a speech-writer explains how
she took a cut in pay and prestige
when the senator for whom she
wrote died. At 36, her goals are to pay
off her Master Card bill and stay
sober.

"I'm clenching myself and in my
fashion, praying, because a drinking
binge would be a very negative way
for me to go next,” she says.

In another story, an unemployed,
unmarried and unexpectedly preg-
nant young woman fends off both
her brother and her ex-boyfriend’.
While her brother tries to grind her
face‘ in grim reality, her ex-boyfriend
tries to seduce her into his web of
grandiose illusion. She sums up the
attitude toward human nature
implied in Robison's stories when she
tells them both off: "It's just that peo-
ple, they don't ever do what they
don't want to do. And they can't ever
be what they aren't already.”

— Robison's characters do » not
undergo sudden epiphanies or
achieve dramatic triumphs. Problems

' are to be endured, not solved, says

Robison.

PET SEMATARY
By Stephen King
Doubleday -

The book jacket claims that Ste-
phen King became so afraid while
writing Pet Sematary that he was
unwilling to finish it. After reading
the book, it's understandable.

Pet Sematary begins with Louis
Creed, a doctor, moving his family
(and pet cat) into a small town in
Maine so that he can practice at a local
infirmary. The Creed’s newhome is
located on a busy roadway, and on
their arrivial, they are warned about
the dangers of the busy roadway by
an old man who lives across the way.

The old man, ]ud Crandall, also tells
them about the ”pet sematary,” a
children's pet burial ground in the
woods behind the house — sacred
Micmac Indian grounds.

Most readers can guess from past
works of King's (Carrie, The Dead Zone,
’Salem's Lot...) that Pet Sematary is full of
terrifying suspense and the kind of
vivid details that keep you involved
right to the bloody end.

story of Celie, a young black woman
in the South of the 1920s and the
decades following. Trapped (along
with her young sister Nettie) in an
uncompromising environment, sexu-
ally abused by her stepfather, traded
into marriage and lacking any other
outlet for expression, Celie addresses
letters to God, expressing her daily
routine. "Long as I can spell G-O-D, I
got somebody along," she reasons.
In the letters, Celie explores her
inner and outer world, growing and
learning. Her husband's lover -

flamboyant blues singer Shug Avery I

— moves into the household tempor-

arily; initial distrust grows into admi— *

ration and affection. From Shug,
Celie discovers the mutual pain and
pleasure of love. ”I think it pisses God
off if you walk by the color purple in a
field somewhere and don't notice it,"
Shug tells Celie. .

Walker's text is composed entirely
of letters —-
addressed to God, later ones written
to sister Nettie, who has become a
missionary in Africa and whose rep-
lies and lifestyle sharply contrast
Celie’s own. The letter format p-roves
surprisingly versatile in Walker's
hands. Celie begins writing at~14. The
last entry — nearly half a century or
so later -— records her sister's joyous
return from Africa.

The Color Purple is equally beautiful
and disturbing. Walker condenses the
Southern American black experience
to a common denominator and in
direct and unpretentious terms.
Celie’s understated letters reflect her
pride and spirit. Her remarkable abil-
ity to accept and to survive persuades
with rare power.

HAVING IT ALL

By Helen Gurley Brown
Pocket Books

All right all you "mouseburgers”
out there —- your book has finally
arrived. If you, too, want to "have it
all” like author Helen Gurley Brown,
this self-help book is just what you
may need.

Having It All guides you in "mouse-
burgering" your way to the top,
through diet, exercise, face and body

‘help, clothes, sex, marri_age, friends,

money and working to the ultimate
of "having it all" —- and what a coinci-
dence! These are also the chapter
headings. Having It All teaches its les-
sons through examples taken from
Helen Gurley Brown's life and the
lives of her famous and often
unnamed friends.

If you're curious about what
Maude Adams eats for breakfast (a
boiled egg and plain yogurt), the most
romantic (and voyeuristic) places to

make love (the Tower of‘Pisa or in a\

canoe, just to name a few) and how to
get married (you'll have to read it to
believe it), then this is the book for
you.

Helen Gurley Brown wrote this
book in such a chatty style that, by
book's end, the reader may think that
it was a friend doing the advising
instead of a famous editor. Iust
remember, you won't believe all that
she writes, and it's up to the reader to

pick up what is believable and what is C

trash.

---' Star 80’ Explodes With True Life‘-—,

By FRANK DiGIACOMO

On Aug. 14, 1980, Dorothy Strat-
ten was found murdered in the blood-
spattered apartment she had shared
with her estranged husband, Paul
Snider. Snider had shot her in the
head with a rifle before turning the
weapon on himself. It would have
gone down in the books as just
another‘ domestic murder/suicide —
"Jealous H’usband Kills Wife, Self" —
and been forgotten, except for one
thing: Dorothy Stratten was Playboy
Magazine's 1980 Playmate of the Year.

The fact that Stratten was qonelof
Hugh Hefner's chosen few has made

her life (and death) story great media .-

fodder and resulted in a string of TV
movies, newspaper articles and even
porno sex-ploitation pieces on the
blonde centerfold.

However, in their hurry to cash in
on the Stratten saga, most have
glossed -over the darker and eventu-
ally dominating half of the Dorothy
Stratten story: Paul Snider.

Bob Fosse hasn't. _

Star 80 isn't about Stratten -—- it's
about Paul Snider, a volatile, sleazy
parasite who captures the innocent
playmate and sucks the very life from
her. In focusing the lens on Snider,
Fosse has created an incredibly dis-
turbing movie that features an
intense performance byrEric Roberts
as the slimeball husband.

Loosely based on Teresa Carpen-
ter's "Death of a Playmate/',which
appeared in The Village Voice, Star 80
begins at the end with asweating,
bloodied Snider screaming obsceni-
ties and curses at his "enemies." The
only glimpse of Stratten (played by
Mariel Hemingway) is a flash of her
blonde hair matted with blood. From
there, the film resorts to flashbacks
interspersed with interviews of peo-
ple who knew_ both Snider “and
Stratten.

g.

The screen quickly reveals Snider's
scummy personality as he supports
himself‘ by ‘pimping and promoting
wet T—shirt contests. Alone in his
pin-up-covered room, Snider pumps
iron and primps his greasy hair while
practicing conversation in front of his
mirror. These scenes are as revolting
as they are revealing.

From the point where Snider meets

the naive Stratten at a Vancouver.

Dairy Queen, the two characters’
destinies diverge: Stratten's ascends
to the heights of a Playboy Playmate
and a promising movie career, while
Snider's plummets to a world of jeal-
ousy, two-timing and tackiness.
Snider seems to realize that he is
losing his grasp on Dorothy. She
spends less and less time with him; he
is despised by the Playboy minions,
especially Hefner himself (played
effectively by Cliff Robertson) and is

lV'Iariel“He'mmgway"an Er1c'R'bertsr us an an Wl e1n'§”obI7osses Star 80.

basically shunnedby the glamorous
world into which Stratten has been
inducted. For Snider, it is only a
matter or time before he consumes
Stratten and himself with his anger.

Throughout, Eric Roberts gives an
incredible performance as the terrify-
ing Snider. His portrayal is stiletto-
sharp as he threatens at any moment
to flare into a maniacal monster, de-

stroyingi everything in his path. One I

of his most memorable scenes occurs
when he is introduced to the people at
Hefner's mansion and manages to
offend everyone he meets, including
the big man himself. Roberts left the
audience cringing with each sleazy
line he delivered.

Mariel Hemingway is adequate as
the innocent Stratten, though it
remains to be seen whether or not

 

she can act and not just portray

herself.

Other memorable performances
include Robertson's Hefner and
Roger Rees’ quirky role as the movie
director who convinces Dorothy to
leave Snider (a role based on real-life
director Peter Bogdonavich, who
worked with Stratten in They All
Laughed). V

Fosse's direction and Sven Nyk
vist’s photography give Star 80a slick
feel that superimposes the multi-
dimensional character of Roberts’
Snider onto a ”flat" Hollywood set-
ting. This intensifies-Snider's role in
Star 80 and makes him an unforgetta-
ble character.

Star 80 is another Fosse triumph
that finds America putting flesh and
beauty on a pedestal only to discover
that there is a worm crawling
between thg idol's teeth.

ln»Reclcless, Johnny Rourke, a
leather-clad, motorcycle-riding out-
cast,“ says, "There's something I've

' got to do. I've got to go Idon't know

where — just somewhere, out of
here, and I've got to go now. See, Iget
real frustrated 'cos there's lots of
stuff that I feel and that I want to say.
But it just — it just doesn't come out
right...." A prophetic statement, con-
sidering that the film, like Johnny's
feelings, doesn't know where it's
going, either.

Reckless is a disastrous, congealing
blob of stale cliches -—- cliches about
youthful rebellion, dying blue-collar
towns, awakening sexuality, social
values and just about anything else
you care to add to the bulging list.
And the cliches, or ”messages" as the
screenwriter probably intended them
to be, are as subtle as a sledgehammer

to the cranium and about as deep as a -

sidewalk mud puddle. Teenage-type
movie's aren't known for their intel-
lectual depth, but this one makes Val-
ley Girl look like Truffaut.

The first few scenes of the movie
are indicative of things to come;

opening shots show Johnny (new-’

comer Aidan Quinn) dressed in his
black leather jacket, straddling his
motorcycle while perched atop an
observation deck looking down into
the dreary smokestacks of the town's
steel mills. The wind whips around
his attractive blue-collar features, the
camera zooms in for a tight shot as he
displays an emotion that screams,
"DESPERATION & ANGER!"
Johnny places his empty beer can
(Iron City, no less) on the very edge
of the deck, revs up his bike and heads
straight for it — Ooooh! Riveting
moment! Will he stop short or keep

 

j-HIT-N-RUN

going straight over the edge? Of
course, this being the beginning of
the movie and all, you know he's not
going to be killed off, even though
after 10 more minutes of such drivel,
you'll wish he'd kept going.

Deep, sensitive guys need deep,

side of the tracks. Never mind the
fact that Tracey, a supposedly "nice"
girl, breaks into the high school and
vandalizes and forget, also, that she's
two-timing on her regular boyfriend,
Randy (Adam Rourke from D.C. Cal:
and My Bodyguard), the obnoxious cap-
tain of the football team. Hey,

of the misunderstood teenager (it
may look like they're just riding
around town at 80 miles an hour and
having lots of gooey sex, but hey,
that's just the way it looks) and decide
that they'd better leave town quickly.
So, off they go, right through the
high school's hallowed halls on John-
ny's Suzuki, with $50 in cash, no lug-
gage and more importantly, no visible
means of contraception.

And herein lies the slapstick irony
of Reckless: the audience is supposed to
see Johnny and Tracey as heroes, a
thinking couple who go after what
they want and who throw conven-
tion to the wind in order to make
their lives better than those lived by
the poor, unemployed steelworkers
and undereducated peers who live in
their town. Instead, this couple with-
out a cause will end up worse off than
the people they don't want to become
—- without so much as a high school
diploma and no skills, what will
become of them?

And what will become of Aidan
Quinn, who's making his acting

debut in this mess? He may be able to .

act, but we certainly can't tell from
his role here -—- he mumbles fre-
quently and tries to look both sensi-
tive and tough, appearing to have
watched too many movies starring
Marlon Brando and James Dean.
Without some kind of miracle, he'll
probably never be heard from again.
Daryl Hannah, who starred in the
equally awful Summer Lovers, will prob-
ably continue in her quest for Dumb-
est Roles For Untalented Former
Models. However, it's difficult to
imagine a role, or a movie, dumber
than this one. Sometimes trash can

SENSATION

Pittsburgh Celebrates The

By LISA LaVALLE

Ingmar Bergman — film-maker,
theater director, playwright;
throughout his career, he has
remained faithful to both stage and
screen. He is a true genius in all
respects, and no other artist comes
close to his mastery of new
dimensions".

Now, Bergman's profound creative
works can be experienced in Pitts-
burgh during the Ingmar Bergman
Film Festival, which is being pres-
ented by the Pittsburgh Playhouse
and the Carnegie Institute of Art in
conjuction with the American pre-

’ miere of Nara~]ulie at the Pittsburgh

Public Theatre. Nora-Iulie, a two-act

play, is an original adaption by Berg-

man based on Ibsen's A Doll House and
Strindberg’s Miss Iulie.

Bergman‘, born in Uppsala,
Sweden, in 1918, traceshis affinity
for film back to his childhood.
Throughout his adolescence, he
spent much of his moneybuying film
equipment and all of his free time at

mar Bergman

the cinema. Although he seldom
went to the theater, it was Strind-
berg's A Dream Play that left a lasting
impression on him. Moreover, Berg-
man worked in the theater before
starting his film career, with Strind-
berg being his major influence.

It wasn't until the 1957 film The
Seventh Seal, however, that Bergman
achieved world-wide critical success.
In this film, Bergman demonstrated
that a film-maker could use the

medium for a far more thoughtful‘

purpose than most people had asso-
ciated with cinema —— philosophical
probing. Bergman dominated the
Swedish cinema unchallenged until

he announced his retirement from S

film-making withthe completion of
Fanny and Alexander, which was
released toward the end of«1983.
"The world of women is my uni-
verse," Bergman was quoted as say-
ing. In fact, Bergman's women is the
ovpriding theme of the present film
series. Renowned author and film
critic Molly Haskell was in Pittsburgh
on Feb. 3 to kick off the event. ”Berg-

 

Ingmar Bergman
man,” Haskell stated, ”has given us
some of the most complex and sexu-
ally intelligent women of cinema."

The city-wide celebration of Berg-
man will continue through February
and into March with the opening .of
Nora-Iulie. The production begins at
the Pittsburgh Public Theatre with a
preview on; Feb; 17; 4 following the
opening on Feb. 22, the play will run
through April 1. (Tuesday through
Saturday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday and
Saturday matinee _at 1:30 p.m. and
Sunday at 1 and 7 p.m.)

This merging of Bergman's ‘theater

adventure, the expensive and

demanding mistress ——— you worship
both, each in its own way.”

cial craftsmanship. It is an unus-
ually soothing album that runs
deep with maturity, intelligence
and most of all, good music.
This time around, Simon
focuses this music on the
paradox that the heart and mind
create—-the contradictions

-between thinking and ‘ feeling

and how, ultimately, it affects
human nature. Sins of pride,
sins of flesh; they're all here on
Hearts And Bones and delivered by
Simon with the subtle angst of a
Woody Allen screenplay.
"Allergies," which opens side
one, slyly assimilates love with a
bout of hayfever, while "Think
Too Much (a)” and "Think Too
Much (b)” are lighthearted,
touching pieces that call for
more articulate speech of the

This five-song LP stands/out

mon characteristics of indies); b)
it doesn't depend on trend
appeal for an audience. While
many other independent labels
are crashing the market with
the acoustic punk wave (Green
On Red, Violent Femmes, Los
Lobos), and everybody else is
trying electronic soul a la Yaz or
the Eurythmics, Wednesday
Week come off as original
simply because they sound as if
they don't listen to anyone else’s
music —— at least not anyone
from the past 10 years or so.
Betsy's House has riffs that’ll
remind you of everything from
a Jackie DeShannon throwaway
to a classic surf song. The mu-
sic's simple —— rarely more than
drums, bass, guitar — as are the
arrangements, but the lyrics,
and especially the singer's
phrasing, are unique enough to
bring you back to the turntable
time after time. Whether the
lyrics rhyme ("Well,. you're a sad
little dog/Can I lciclr you again?/I cer-
tainly was clever/Getting you for a

heart and less logic. "Rene And
Georgette Magritte With Their
Dog After The War" sadly
determines that passion does
not equate to love; "The Late
Great Johnny Ace” is for those
who thought they weren't John
Lennon fans but still feel the
emptiness of his death.

Most evocative of Hearts /Ind
Bones though, is "Train In The
Distance,” which somberly
implies that love is a vicious
cycle for its smitten participants
——- one relationship being no
better than the other. At this
point the paradox is temporarily
dissolved as Simon's lyrics
remind that "The thought that life
could be better/ls woven indelible/Into
our hearts//ind our brains."

Throughout, Simon powers
his pondering lyrics with music
made by a great crew of back-up
musicians including Nile
Rodgers, Bernard Edwards,
Steve Gadd, the I-Iarptones and
even a cameo appearance by
guitar genius Al Di Meola on

_ "Allergies.” The musical perfor-

mances are very strong but
manage to maintain a tranquil-
ity that complements the often
reflective lyrics.

In fact, as a whole, Hearts /ind

Bones displays a subdued atmos- «

phere that seems aimed at the
older listener who would be
drawn to Simon's thinking
man's artistry. Consequently,

LESLIE VAN BUSKIRK

Great singles, but where's the
album? Irene Cara, the apple of
Giorgio Moroder’s money clip,
may be able to survive by sing-
ing title songs to movie sound-
tracks, but she'll sure as hell
never make it in the full—length
album department —- at least
not this time. '

The only saving graces of
What A I-'eelin' are the hit singles
that have been taken from the
Flashdance ("Flashdance...What A
Feeling") and D.C. Cab (”Why
Me" and "The Dream") sound-
track albums. The rest of this
stuff is pure drivel that must
have been thrown together just
so Cara could fill her empty biki-
ni top with spare change.

There seems to be an attempt
to incorporate every musical fad
and fashion into What A Feelin’.
"Romance '83” is the obligatory
synth-pop number; "Cue Me
Up" is its over-Iobligatory
follow-up; ”Breakdance" is self-
explanatory, and let's just

Hearts And Bones seeks no com-

If that's not enough, Cara's
voice, which is strong on the

Probably the only redeeming

_BALLS TO THE WALL
Accept

= Portrait

Five men from West Ger-
many call themselves Accept.
Their album is called Balls To The
Wall, and it's dedicated to "all
the people in the world." How
nice; but there's one thing —
theirs is bland, loathsome and
distasteful rock-n-roll.

At their most listenable (if
you can call it that), they sound
much like a second—rate
AC/DC. Only the title cut, and
perhaps "Love Child," approach
a slightly bearable heavy-metal
sound, which leaves the rest of
the album best labeled as
”trash." Loud and repetitious
guitar riffs lack a true rock-n-
roll energy and go nowhere.
Distressing and offensive lyrics
("I can't wait to get you/Down

on the dirty floor") are, fortu-

group's attempt at a rock ballad
(an insipid little song called
"Winterdreams") falls flat, and I

songs on the album aren't really
about anything in particular,
and they don't make much
sense.

JEANNETTE — What was going
on in Room 108 at Jeannette Senior
High School Thursday afternoon
was not typical of a day in the life of
a normal high school student.

Instead‘ of I7-year-olds filing in
for-their last class ofthe day, middle-
aged reporters,Vcameramen and
photographers occupied the room,
eagerly awaiting one student’s col--
lege choice.

This student, Dante Wiley, is not
your average high school kid. His
6-2 1/2, 185-lb. frame and numerous
athleticxawards indicate that.

Wiley, the most sought-after high i

school football player in Western
Pennsylvania, decided that Pitt is
the best place to showcase his tal-
ents, picking the Panthers over Penn
State.

“I just felt, in my heart that Pitt
was for me,” Wiley said.

Wiley, who made the decision
Thursday morning, said the football
team and academic opportunities —
he plans to major in electrical engi-
neering -- were the main reasons he
selected Pitt.

By Mark A. sindier’
The Pitt News

In one sense, the saga of Jeff
Robinson took a new twist two days
ago when Pitt basketball coach Roy
Chipman suspended the sophomore
transfer for the rest of the season.
According‘ to Ed Badger, Robin-
son’s former coach at the University
of Cincinnati, though, his suspen-
sion was nothing new at all.

Chipman met with Robinson
Wednesday in the wake of the 6-9
center’s comments in The Pittsburgh
Press following Saturday's loss to
Boston College. Robinson said
Chipman “lied” about increased
playing time he was supposed to
receive against Providence and BC.

Chipman is expected to meet with

.Robinson next week and again at

the end of the season. For now, he
will remain on scholarship through
April. ’

“I’m not going to [fully] suspend a
kid because of what occurred in the
paper," Chipman said. “I think a lot
of.,things occur between a coach and
his players. But that shouldn’t be in
the paper. It's a situation now where
it’s healthy for him to concentrate on
school and get his act together.”

Recruited out of Indianapolis’
Broad Ripple High School, Robin-
son signed with the University of

Cincinnati for the 1981-82 season,

but transferred after one year.
According to Badger, Robinson suf-
fered attitude problems then, as he
does now.

“When we let him go, we were
I I-2," said Badger, now an assistant
with the NBA’s Cleveland Cavaliers.’

back, but he also possesses the rifle-
like arm to play quarterback, as evi-
denced by his selection to the 1983
All-State team at that Qosition, In

, addition, he was selected to the All-

Conference team as a punter.

“I’1l have my shot at quarter-
back," he said. “But if that doesn't
work out, I’ll go somewhere else like
free safety." V

One reason Wiley's press confer-
ence received so.much attention is
that this is the first time the media
have had the opportunity to inter-
view him. Jeannette coach Joe
Mucci imposed a blackout on player
interviews during the season.

“I think one ofthemost important
things was‘ to impress on these kids
'tl_iat'team morale had to be kept,”
Mucci said. “We had three Division
I prospects in Dante, Mark (Brasco,
kicker, who will also attend Pitt) and
Maurice Chamberlain, and we had
to keep things in proper perspective.

“I think the kids came through it
beautifully.”

Mucci, like Wiley and his family,
faced the pressure of college coaches
and media alike.

“Defensively, that
was a problem. He

“I had no ‘personal troubles [with
him], but he kept telling the press, ‘If
I‘m not going to play, I was going to
transfer.‘ “

in both institutions.

‘‘I’m glad it’s all over, and Dante ‘

will do very well at the University of
Pittsburgh."

Another person who is pleased all
the hoopla has ended is Gerri Wiley,
Dante’s mother. Mrs. Wiley let out a
resounding “yes" when asked if she

was happy the recruiting season had ’

ended.

“At first, we were speechless, see-
ing all these famous coaches coming
to the door,” she said. “After a while,
you find. out they, are the same as
you.”

As far as the family input on the
decision, Mrs. Wiley said she and
her husband, Parris, judged each
school but left the ﬁnal choice to
Dante.

“We gave him the pros and cons
on all the schools,” she said. “But
Dante had to make the decision.”

While the Wiley family is relieved
the recruiting season for their son is
over, Dante did not mind the atten-
tion he received on his first media

I gathering. »

“I hope to go through it again,” he
said.

Badger: Jeff Robinson’s  
problems are nothing new  

At Cincinnati, Robinson played
in I 1 games, starting one, for a total
of 128 minutes. He also accounted
for 37 points and 24 rebounds for the
Bearcats. This all after scoring more
than 2,000 points at Broad Ripple,

, which ‘Won the state championship

in his junior year.

“It was just basically his attitude,"
Badger continued. “He was more
self-centered than team-oriented.
Offensively, [he was a good player.
Defensively, that was a problem. He
couldn’t even guard his sister. But

there was nothing he couldn’t work .

out."

. When contacted, the 202—lb. cen— ”

ter refused to talk about his current
status or the past.

“I don’t have anything to say,”
Robinson said. “I’m going to leave it
alone.”

After ineligibility forced him to sit
out last season, Robinson entered
1983-’84 expecting to fill a glaring

void at center. He started successive ~

early season games against Florida
State and Duquesne (Dec. 20 and
27), but has seen only limited action
since.. .

In seven appearances this year,
Robinson had scored 26 points and
grabbed five rebounds. Badger
insists nothing has changed since
two seasons ago. . . V

“Seems like the same situation [at
Pitt] as at our place,”he said. “I feel

ers supported my way. They thought
of him as a pain in the ass.”

Conversely, the relationship
between Chipman and Robinson is
panning out differently. Quite
differently. L

“I don't think there’s a personal
problem with me; it’s the pressure in

‘the press he's been getting,” Chip-

man said. “People are telling him to
do this and that. He‘s had a lot of
fanfare. He had that at Cincinnati —
it hampered him. He became dis-
heartened and showed it at times
when you shouldn’t. It's hard to be
attacked after a game." ’
Although Chipman did not con-
tact Badger upon hearing of Robin-

son's availability, he was aware of
personal conflicts. “We knew then
there was some problem, but in talk-
ing to those involved, it was nothing
hard-core. He wasn‘t a violent type,"
Chipman added.

Badger could not readily deter-
mine whether Robinson‘s personal-
ity differences stemmed from earlier
years.

“The thing is, it was a strange high
school situation,” he recalled. “I
could never get close to his coach. So
I don’t know the answer to that,
whether he had an attitude problem
in high school. The coach wouldn‘t
talk to us. He and Robinson’s family
did not get along well.”

The Lady Panther basketball
team's quest to extend its winning
streak was decisively rebuked by
Penn State Wednesday night.

The Lady Lions (14-9) ran all over
Pitt (13-9) en route to a 93-56 thrash-
ing at State College. Head coach
Judy Saurer was not available for
comment, but assistant coach Janet
Gabriel analyzed the Lady Panthers’
downfall.

“Basically, I think our biggest
problem was (failing to) control the
boards,” said Gabriel. “They took us
out of our game. We figured if we
could dominate the boards, we
could control the pace ofthe game,”

Pitt will take on St. John’s Satur-
day at 5:00 p.m., who is one of the
two teams with whom they share
first place in the conference, the

. other being Providence. The three

teams top the crop at 4-1, with St.
John‘s leading the overall record

. category at 18-2.

Pitt's leading scorer Jennifer
Bruce (24.4) was held to 18 points,

tively with Penn State's press. “They
were all over everyone, stealing the
ball and getting layups,” she said .
Early in the first half, Callan noticed
that her team was slightly behind,
10-8, the only point at which the
score was close.

“The next time I looked, it was
something like 28-12, and we never
got back in the game," said Callan.
“They also double-teamed Jennifer
(Bruce), they werejust all over her. I
felt sorry for her.”

Pitt shot 40.7 percent from the
field, but Penn State grabbed three
out of every four missed shots. As a
result, Pitt took few second shots
and a severe scoring drought ensued.
Pitt managed to collect only seven
offensive rebounds.

Lisa Fubio blamed her team's
ineffectual offense on its inability to
break the Lady Lions’ full,-court de-
fensive press. “We’ve seen the 2-2-1
press many times this season, but
instead of passing the ball up the
court, we tried to dribble through it.

lt would take us 15 secondsjust to
get the ball up the court, and that left
only 15 seconds to try to score [due
to the 30-second clock]. They also
picked our 2-3 defense apart by
sending one person long,” said
Fubio.

Kim Tirik, who leads the confer-
ence in assists with 142, left nothing
out in her appraisal. “Everything
went wrong,” she said. “They forced
turnovers and got easy buckets from

' that." Pitt committed 28 turnovers

and stole the ball only six times. “We
couldn't break their press and they
got the rebounds.

“We were pretty even for the first

A five minutes or so but from then on,

it was all downhill," said Tirik.

’ Lady Panthers travel

to WVU for Hardee’s

ByNhﬂaGmmh
The Pitt News

This weekend the Lady Panther
track team will travel to the Univer-
sity of West Virginia for the third

(3-time this season to participate in the

Hardee‘s Invitational.

“It‘s good competition for us,“
said Pitt coach Elbert Kennedy.
“-We’re beginning to be very
competitive.“

The “us" consists of sprinters
Renee Henderson, Gail Counts,
Edie Butler, Felicia Blake, Sue
Torre and lone long-distance runner
Amy DeFencisco.

After last week’s performance at
the Princeton Invitational, confi-
dence in the team has risen.

“They all run well together,“ said
Kennedy. “They look out for each
other, there’s no prima donnas.
Defeats and losses are shared by
them [the team] as one.“

The team has come a long way
since last year. “The team didn‘t
have any quarter-milers. Now we
have two and they're both natural at
the distance," said Kennedy. Two
events in the middle—distance cate-
gory last year are covered this year.

3 Butler runs the 400-meter while

Blake runs the 800-meter.

Each runner is expecting some-
thing of themselves. “Up until
Princeton I wasn't pleased with my
running. Now I feel like my own self
and I want to run a good race,” said

~.

Blake. “This meet is a milestone."
She said patience plays a big part in
her performance.

Butler said,  whole perfor-
mance at a meet is based on faith."
She dedicates her track career to
God, a moment of silence and medi-
tation for her teammates as well as
for herself. She’s satisfied if she's
does her best —— “being the best that I
could possibly be,” is Butler’s favor-
ite motto.

Torre said, “I‘m in better shape
this week than I was three weeks
ago.“ She’d like to run a better time
and her goal is to improve.

Like Torre, DeFrencisco also
expects improvement, “I was in
much better shape last year. This
year I‘m concentrating on the 3000-
meter run, which is my best race."
She said the 1500-meter is too fast
and the .5000-meter is too long.

The Lady Panthers will field one
relay team. Henderson, Counts,
Blake and Butler will compete in the
(4x400) I600-meter event. Individu-
ally, Henderson. Counts and Torre
will go in the 55- and 200-meter
dashes. Butler and Blake are sche-
duled in the 400- and 800-meter
events, respectively. DeFrencisco
will compete in the 3000-meter run.

“Quality is moving up as we run
each meet," said Kennedy. “We run
to win, but our goal is to improve -
maybe get a faster time, something
positive.“

Swimmers renew rivalry with Princeton

By_Mary Dalgle
The Pitt News
“We’re ready,” said Lady

Panther swimming coach Dave
Belowich of his team’s dual meet
with Princeton this Saturday at 1
p.m.

The swim team started what
Belowich called a “tapering
phase” this week in preparation
for Saturday's meet and the Big
East Championships, which will
be held at Trees Pool beginning
Feb. l6.

According to Belowich, taper-
ing constitutes shorter but more
intense practices. He said his
team has eliminated its morning

practice so the swimmers can rest
up for a toughened afternoon
workout.

The team‘s goal for the meet
against Princeton is not only to
win, but also to continue improv-
ing its times.

“Princeton is almost like a
tuner for the Big East,” Belowich
said. But rest assured, the Lady
Panthers will not be looking past
their rivals from the New Jersey.

The rivalry between Pitt and
Princeton has been around for
years, but this year's team has
extra incentive to beat the Lady
Tigers. Part of the reason is that
Princeton coach Maura Cost-
man hasn't been entirely cooper-
ative in arranging the event.
Also, the Panthers still

remember to last year, when
Princeton left them off its
schedule.

“Now that we have the meet,
we want to show them what kind
of team we have," said sopho-
more Georgia Spolsky.

Against the Lady Tigers, Pitt's
200-yard freestyle relay team will
be looking to make the qualify-
ing time for Nationals. “We are
thinking ahead of time for this
meet," Belowich said.

The team of Sue Hickman,
Denise Sedlacek, Tracy Pfister
and Alicia Dugan made a last-
minute decision in to go for the
qualifying time in last week’s
meet against Youngstown State
but fell short by four tenths of a
second.

Lady gymnasts face Clarion

By Wes Cotter
The Pitt News

lt’s hard to be humble when
you're on a roll!

lt’s even harder when you are
planning for a meet with a team
that just doesn’t measure up.

Its a pleasant position and it’s
the one the Lady Panther gym-
nastics team will be in this week
when they meet the Golden
Eagles of Clarion State
University.

The Lady Panthers are coming
off of a win two weeks ago
against West Virginia University “
in which Pitt set a new all-time
team scoring record of 178.]
points.

Pitt coach Donna Sanft said,
“We don’t really feel like winning

or losing is important. We want a
good team score." Sanft went on
to say that Pitt‘s expecting” a
team score ofat least [78 tonight.

“We don't want to go. back-
wards, we want to keep improv-
ing our scores.” She then
commented with a rather large
smile that Clarion has been aver-
aging between l59 and l66
points.

“We should do very well.
We’re really psyched, and I think
we should kill Clarion,” Kristy
Pieters said. ’

Pieters will compete in the all-
around this weekend after being
out of action with knee prob-
lems. In addition to Pieters’
injuries, Jackie Calderone hyper-
extended her knee this week in
practice and will be unable to
compete. Debbie Dabkowski

also will be doubtful for the

meet.

Sanft said that these injuries
should be covered by the team’s
depth. She explained that six

_ girls will compete in the all-

around.

Pitt‘s lady gymnasts had last
weekend off, and according to
Sanft, it didn‘t hurt them.

“It gave everybody a chance to
rest and try some new things they
haven't had time for. This meet
should get us back on a decent
schedule."

She went on to say that the
ratio of falls the team has expe-
rienced is something her gym-
nasts are working on.

Sanft said that in their record
setting meet two weeks ago there
were three falls. “We have a
countdown to the meet where we
don’t have any falls. We can do it
this week if we hit.”

For The Pitt News _

Those who enjoy art seldom see
drawings displays as a tour de force
in their own right. Today’s painting
continues to be dominated by relief
abstractions with little trace of the
precisely drawn line.

But the current exhibition at the
University Art Gallery in_the Frick
Fine Arts Building predates this
trend. Gathered are portrait draw-
ings by some of the foremost Italian
artists working between 1400 and
1800. It boasts some 40 sketches
including works by famed fresco
artists Guido Reni, the Carracci
brothers, Andrea Sacchi and Giam-
battist Tiepoloi All pieces are from
North American collections, most
notablythe Janos Scholz collection

_ of Pierpont Morgan Library, the

Art Museum of Princeton Univer-
sity and the Metropolitan Museum
of Art.

The show, with its ink and chalk
sketches of the human face, shows

¢.

Renaissance art!

the power and beauty of a pencil in 4
‘ the hands of an artist.

The exhibition was organized as
an independent project by Adelheid
M. Gealt, curator at the Indiana
University Art Museum. Following
its run here through February 26,
the show travels to its third and final
exhibit at Oberlin College. At Pitt,
the exhibit happily coincides with
the term of Fine Arts Visiting Mel-
lon professor Dr. Ann Sutherland
Harris,a formidable scholar in Ital-
ian baroque.

Occasional notes in the accom-
panying catalogue refer the reader to
Harris’ rexearch concerning ques-
tions of artist attributions. On cer-
tain works, the signature is
smudged, filled in by a different
hand, or simply not there. Attribu-
tion concerning these drawings is the
subject of heated academic debate.

The show offers an intimate
observation of Italian people of all
ages, both sexes, though mostly
from the upper classes. While a few
of the 18th century portraits may
distance us with status regalia, most
are presented in unencumbered

directness.

The show opens with a stunning
Renaissance profile of a tonsured
monk by an unknown North Italian
master. The monk’s Roman features
are well chisled and smoothed by the
artist's use of black chalk with white
heightening rubbed to a fine finish
on the antiquated paper.

Memorable in its expression of
palpable pathos is Federico _Zucca-
ro’s honest portrait of his mother.
Thin-skinned and frail, her dimin-
ished face reflects a disappointed
recognition of the world and her
unabated love for her artist son.

One of the more direct statements
in chalk is Agostino Carracci’s “Por-
trait of a Woman" used as the fron-
tispiece of the show. The
workmanship of an artist 400 years
ago'still holds viewers captive now.

The exhibition is a fascinating
chronicle of ‘portraits drawn from
the various schools of Italian art
throughout the ‘four centuries.
Gallery hours are Tuesday through
Saturday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Sun-
day from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.
