Lothrop Hall's RD
resigns following a
‘quiet hour’ dispute

By Jim Lakely
and Christine Hanna
The Pitt News

Mary Ellen Hiotakis, a third—year resident director of Lothrop
Hall, resigned Oct. 2 over what she described as a simple noise
report being blown into a racial issue.

Sydney Lewis and’ other ninth ﬂoor residents complained to
Office of Residence Life officials that they were unfairly accused
of noise violations because they are African American.

Although it was a resident assistant who wrote the report,
Hiotakis, as the resident director, was held accountable by the
students for racial insensitivity.

Hiotakis said she resigned because ORL did not support her
View concerning the noise incident and it succumbed to racial
pressure by tearing up the written noise report. Hiotakis said that
“all basic procedures should be followed whether black, white or
other minority.”

According to Hiotakis, some time before Sept. 24, an excessive

LCB addresses under age drinking at fraternity parties

By Rachael DeVine
Staff Writer

Drugs and alcohol were addressed
at Greek 101 last night in the William
Pitt Union Ballroom.

Officer Jerry Farmer, of the Bureau
of Liquor Control Enforcement, told
students what will happen if they use
fake identification.

“On top of the fact that you will
receive a fine [of up to $300] and
have your licence suspended for 90
days, you will have another fine on
top of that [of upto $500] and anoth-
er 90-day suspension tacked on,”
Farmer said.

Farmer told Greek students that
other than being under age and using
a fake ID, the law would also hit
them hard for charging people to

drink at their parties.

“If you are charging people to get
in, then in the eyes of the law you are
running a speakeasy, and that makes
for a criminal record,” Farmer said.

Farmer told students how he was
arrested for underage drinking when
he was 20.

“That arrest didn’t prove to be detri-

mental to my life. You just have to ~

remember that if you think you are
man or woman enough to drink, then
you should be man or woman enough
to get caught,” he said.

Sergeant Charles Grier of Pitt’s

Public Safety told students how they
can avoid police-related drinking
problems.

“It is very important to remember
that we only come because of com-
plaints,” Grier said.

Grier said students should keep par-
ties under control, and as a preven-
tive measure, just started in the
past five years, students can make
negotiations with the residents in the
area.

“We have had cases where people
are defecating on lawns. You can
understand why residents of the area

"call us,” Grier said.

The last speaker of_ the evening,
Shirley Haberman of Pitt’s Student
Health, presented alcohol-related sta-
tistics.

“Do you realize that 70 percent of
the violence on this campus is alcohol
related, and, that 40 percent of
the academic failure can be said to
be alcohol related? You have to make
the connection yourself for these
numbers to have an impact,”

Haberman said.

Haberman said she is glad there is
such a bond within a fraternity or
sordrity because brothers and sisters
look after each other, but it is not so
easy for first—year students.

“If you are a freshman and in the
Greek system, you are terribly vulner-
able. Most of the reported troubles
on this campus come from freshmen
in the Greek system,” Haberman
said.

Haberman touched on the subject
of drinking and driving to let students
know they must not be involved with
a vehicle if they are going to choose
to drink.

Haberman distributed car-shaped
key chains with the slogan, “Don’t go
boozin’ if your gonna be cruizin” to
students.

Don't let Halloween treats trick your body

et’s face it. We were
born with a sweet tooth.
It’s known that infants
with no prior feeding

( experience respond to sugar

solutions with vigorous sucking,
lip licking and expressions of

' contentment. Feed those same

infants a bitter solution, and they
respond with spitting, tongue
protrusions and expressions of
dislike.

These reactions are not
learned, they are innate. We are
born with them. They came in
handy for primitive people and
gave them a selective advantage

' over nature. Wl1en you look at

their diet, the fruits, berries and
other sweet tasting plant foods
were safe to eat. The plants ,with
bitter tastes were more likely to
be poisonous. So by developing
a preference for sweet tastes,
primitive people were more

likely to consumethe sweet,

safer foods. The fruits and
berries were also good sources
of calories, which they needed
to survive. Remember, they
didn’t have the vast selection of

250 calories. About 50 percent
of the calories will come from
fat and the other 50 percent
from sugar. Most of the choco-
late bars are made with the
“bad” fats: palm kernel oil, lard
and cocoa butter. These fats
raise cholesterol levels in the
blood. Candy bars without
chocolate will be mostly sugar,
as will gummy bears, lollipops,
licorice and candy corn.

Highlfat diets are associated
with weight gain, and if some of
those fats are the “bad” (saturat-
ed) fats, the risk of developing
heart disease is increased.
Sugar can be a factor in dental
caries (cavities), especially when
sugar is in foods that stick
to the surface of teeth. The
longer the sugar remains in con-
tactlwith the tooth enamel the
greater the chances of tooth
decay_. What’s the
solution? Enjoy one candy bar
and then brush your teeth.

Varvaro
receives  
coveted
award

By Paul Grubbs

For the Pitt News

Filomena F. Varvaro,

assistant professor at»

Pitt’s School of Nursing,
has won the first United
Way Senator John Heinz
Award.

The award goes to a
local volunteer who has
outstanding commitment
and dedication to com-
munity service.

- For the past 14 years
Varvaro has worked for

the Women’s Center & '

Shelter of Greater
Pittsburgh, one of the
first domestic violence
projects in the country.

“It’s very important that
we have helped the
women and the center,”
Varvaro said.

The WC&S provides a
supportive community
that shelters women and
children who have been
the victims of domestic
violence. Amongst its
goals is educating the
public about domestic
violence. and being
involved in the process
of primary prevention.

Varvaro has performed
numerous duties: from
answering the center’s
seven—day'-a-week, 24-
hour hotline, which pro-

vides information, coun-.

seling and referrals for
battered women and
their children, to writing
a manual for emergency
room personnel to edu-
cate them on how to rec-
ognize a victim of abuse.
The protocols in the
manual led to new stan-
dards of education of
hospital staff — especial-
ly emergency personnel
—— on how to deal with
and treat victims of
domestic violence.

Varvaro is also

’ involved in group and

individual counseling,
education of the public,
leading a weekly support
group and researching
domestic violence issues.
In addition to her vol-

‘ unteer work and teach-

ing, she has done
research on the recovery
of women who have
coronary artery disease.

Veterans, disabled students access support services

By Mike Laughlin

Staﬂ Writer

Imagine starting college after
spending some years in the mili-
tary and how much you would
feel like an outsider in a class
room or dorm full of 18-year-old
kids fresh out of high school.

Imagine “being visually or
hearing impaired, in need of
tape-recorded textbooks and
sign-language interpreters for

L class lectures or not being able

to enter buildings as a result of
being confined to a wheelchair.
That is where the Office of
Veterans and Disabled Student
Services comes in. Located on
the second ﬂoor of the William
Pitt Union, it assists discharged
veterans attending the University
of Pittsburgh by obtaining bene-
fits from a variety of Veterans’
Affairs educational assistance

- Dependents

programs, while also ‘providing
support services to students with
disabilities so their experience at
Pitt will be a little easier for
them.

“It’s been around since the
Vietnam War ended, probably
been around before then,” said
Donald Grafﬁus, coordinator for
the veterans’ services.

The services provided to vet-
erans, and their dependents if
applicable, deal strictly with VA
educational benefits, which
include the New Montgomery
G.I. Bill, the Veterans’
Educational Assistance Program
and the Survivors and
Educational
Program. The office helps veter-
ans with filling out paperwork
and making certain that they get
their money.

Any other problems that veter— I

ans may have are referred to the

occasionally counsels students.

“Don Graffius is a great help
to anyone "who comes in here,
veteran or not,” said Ron
Horvath, a senior and veteran
who works at the ofﬁce.

The other branch of the office
provides support services to stu-
dents with disabilities, such as
interpreters for students with
hearing impairments and readers
for students with visual impair-
ments, said Sabina Bilder, a stu-

dent services specialist who

coordinates services for students
with disabilities.

Bilder said that the office must
also make certain that there are
“reasonable accommodations” in
campus buildings. “We have to
make, sure [the physically chal-

lengedl can get into our build-
ings,” she said. '

Bilder said that the office
owes its creation to Section 504
of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.
The section states that individu-
als with disabilities cannot be
discriminated against by compa-
nies and institutions like Pitt.

Bilder also said the office was
established because of disabled
students receiving financial assis-
tance from the federal govern-
ment, which forced Pitt to
become more accommodating
to them. People with disabilities
were becoming more vocal at
the time, so there was a need
for assistance.

It is only ﬁtting that the curator
of the Stephen Foster Memorial
oncelived on the banks of the
Suwannee River in Florida — a
place immortalized in FOster’s
classic ballad “Old Folks at
HOme” which begins, “Way down
upon the Swanee River.”

- ‘While we all know at least the

ﬁrst line of that song, curator Dr.
Deane Root said there is a lot
more we can learn from Foster,
the mid-19th century composer,
who is famous for writing “Oh
Susanna” and “Jeannie With the
Light Brown Hair.”

“Historians have called his
music the first distinctly American
[music] because it didn’t, exist any-
where else,” he said.

Root has concentrated on the

memorial’s extensive collection of
early American music since he
became curator in 1982. His aim
has been to preserve and make
the collection accessible to the
public. He said that less than half
of the collection are items relating
to FOster’s career.

“This is, the most important cen-

Root said the cOmpOser’s music

' bridged the gap between many

ethnic and minority groups by
appealing to common denornina—
tors among all people.

"‘He is the first white composer
to write songs about blacks that
were hymns to the beauty of the
spirit, rather than poking fun at
racial differences, which was ram-
pant in his time,” he said. “His

 

music was among the first and
most powerful pieces to be used
in the battle for emancipation in
the 1850s.”

Root is also concerned with
stimulating musicians, writers and
the media to highlight Foster and
his music. Foster’s songs have
been covered recently by popular
artists like Waylon Jennings, Syd
Straw and Emmylou Harris.

Root Said he is looking forward

to the completion of the first

Lewis told The Pitt News on
Oct. 5 bringing the issue to

Noise on the floor contin-

problems with racism go
beyond this isolated floor
incident. She said that the RAs
don’t have sufficient training
to deal with sensitive racial
issues. She said African-

referred to as “they” and “you

Woodson said that the

the RAs participate in lectures
and programs that show them
the cultural differences and
needs of the incoming resi-
dents.

When contacted for reac-
tion to Hiotakis’ resignation,
Lewis declined to give a sec-
ond interview saying she
agreed with Ryan that the res-
idents are trying to move on.

for me,” he said. “I think that
comedy was easier because at
least I knew what I wanted to
do. College can be hard
because you don’t know what
you want to do.”

According to Sinbad, college
students are under a lot of
pressure when they are in col-
lege because their parents are
telling them to be things that
they don’t want to be.

“Parents send their children
to college putting in their heads
that they want to be doctors
when they don’t really want to
be, that’s one of the biggest
problems with college kids

today,” Sinbad said.

Admitting that college can be
hard, he also says that college
is worth the experience.

“A college education showed
me that I could learn. It also
taught me a lot of social skills,
and it taught me how to
depend on others yet also be
independent.”

According to Todd Cable,
director of Special Events for
the Pitt Program Council, an
estimated crowd of 1,800
packed Soldiers and Sailors to
see Sinbad as part of the home-
coming events going on this
week.

A lot of the students were in
attendance just because they
like Sinbad’s ability to be
humorous without being vul-
gar.

According to Shelby Patrick,
a psychology major who got to
meet Sinbad “he hasa wonder-
-ful personality and is very
down to earth, he is as humor-
ous off stage as he is on.”

“He shows he can be funny
without being profane,” Pitt
student Tony Dorsett Jr. said.
“It’s stuff that you can enjoy.
He’s not vulgar, and you can
gain a new respect for peop
like that.” =

“He’s a talented man. He gets
his point across,” said Pitt stu-
dent Orlando Antigua.

According to Sinbad, educa-
tion is a very important step in
life but a life long one, he told
The Pitt News.

“It’s important to follow your
dreams and continue to edu-
cate yourself,” he said. “When
you get that piece of paper,
that’s when the education
begins.”

  Honecker's last song

Let us turn back the clocks for a moment to the year
1980. Ronald Reagan, the former governor from
California and Hollywood actor, was running to unseat
a peanut farmer from Georgia — incumbent President
Jimmy Carter. Like 1992, the economic stagnation was a
major issue. But unlike this year, it was not the only
issue which concerned this country. There was a
hostage crisis which caught the attention and hearts of
all America and a giant red menace participating in an
arms race, which could have meant‘ world destruction.
Names like Breshznev, ‘Honecker and Reagan permeat-
ed the world news. The distinction between good and
evil was as clear as that of night and day in each coun-
try’s respective minds.

Today the world is a different place.» The mood no
longer rests on the difference between cold war defini-
tions of good and evil but rests instead on the competi-
tion between friendly rivalries. ‘Eastern Europe as we
knew it has been through a time warp, answering more
to market mechanisms than to the cloud which hung
over it. Furthermore, the only Communist threat which
remains is the rhetorical one about Bill Clinton — not
the Russia of Stalin. Slowly but surely, the Soviet Union
of the past is slipping into the past which is destined to
become a major chapter in the history books. "However,
those ‘ days should not be permanently inscribed just
yet’. There are still a few inscriptions to make.

One of those not-yet-permanently inscribed memories
is former East German leader Erich Honecker. Soon
after Nov. 12, the day his trial begins, Honecker is like-

ly to become a ﬂeeting thought as. well. He and five I

others are under scrutiny for the shooting death of four

V , people trying to escape over the Berlin Wall, as well as

1}

the death of eight more killed by mines or booby traps
on the border with the West. '

While Honecker should face _the full -impact of the
German legal system, it is very important to remember
that his country was answerable to a higher power —
the Soviet Union. Their inﬂuence and power should
not be underestimated. They crushed uprisings in
Hungary in 1956 and in Czechoslovakia in 1968. The
leaders of these satellite nations were not always the
ones at fault. , ’ ‘

However, the fact that Honecker is 80 years old, in
poor health and was a puppet to both a system and the-
Soviet Union is not an excuse. Three-hundred-and-fifty
peopledied in escape attempts since 1961. More than
that died for political objections. Families that lived less
than 10 miles away from one another were permanent-
ly separated, and people were forced to inhibit their
ideas.’ Despite the fact that Honecker was not entirely
responsible for his actions, he should be held account-
able.

Justice must be served for the thousands who died.

You are at a party and peo-
ple are drinking beer. You
offer a beer to an acquaintance
and he accepts —— only to
sneak away quietly and pour
the beer down the drain. This
has to make you mad. Another
example: You smoke. While
you are smoking a friend, who
you know doesn’t smoke, asks
you for a cigarette. You oblige,
only to watch him or her
smoke the cigarette without
inhaling, putting on a Charade
to impress you. What does this
say about the individual’s char-
acter? -

You say you’re tired of hear-
ing that a person’s character is
important. You say we
shouldn’t concern ourselves
with the past lives of our presi-
dential candidates. You’re
wrong. The character of a can-
didate is of the utmost impor-
tance.

Bill Clinton’s character has

become cliche. Bush has been
pounding on the character
issue because it is hislstrongest
weapon in the fight against
Slick Willy’s ascent to the pres-
idency.
‘ Consider this: We are about
to elect into our nation’s high-
est office a man who has in
one way or another smoked
marijuana, probably been
involved in an extramarital
affair, dodged the draft and
probably done a few things in
Russia that you or I wouldn’t
even think of. But you say,
who cares?

I’ll admit there are a lot of
“maybes” and “probablys”
here. But I’m focusing on the
“definite” —— the fiasco sur-
rounding Bill Clinton’s pot
smoking experience. I know,
can’t we let sleeping dogs lie?

Clinton should have inhaled

But,I’m not telling you how
evil Clinton was for smoking
pot at Oxford. I’m not con-
cerned with that. In fact, I
couldn’t care less if he were an
avid dope smoker to this day!
If America wants him, then
more power to this confused
country. What I’m concerned
with is the way it came to the
public’s eye. And I’m also con-
cerned with the answer Boy
Clinton gave to his accusers.

Chris
Diersen

You may or may not be

vr aware of the particulars, so .let

me take a moment to fill you
in. Clinton was asked some
time ago if allegations that he
had smoked marijuana were
true. Clinton responded slickly,
“I have never broken the laws
of this country.”

About a month later, the
same question was posed to
him. Again he responded, “I
have never broken the laws of
this country.” A

Then, finally, someone got
wise. Soon thereafter, someone
asked him, “Bill, have you ever
smoked marijuana while out-
side of this country?” Whammo!
He was nabbed. But Clinton’s
slickness prevailed. He admit-
ted to his use of marijuana
while at Oxford. But he said he
didn ’t inhale.

This is where I would like
for you, the reader, to engage
with me on some introspective
thought. Logic dictates that
either Clinton told the truth or
he lied.

If he smoked pot and
inhaled, presumably getting
high, then he lied to the

American public. If, however,
he told the truth and didn’t
inhale,. I’m going to convince
you that it’s even worse than if
he had lied.

For one thing, let’s accept
the fact you’d be hard—pressed
to find anyone Clinton’s age
who hadn’t smoked marijuana
during the late ‘60s or early
‘70s. Now let’s assume that Bill
told the truth when he said he
smoked but didn’t inhale. No
big deal, smoking pot doesn’t
make you the anti-Christ and
most likely didn’t damage
Clinton’s brain to any large
extent. So, having established
that, what’s the problem?

It’s the scenario I mentioned
in the beginning. That person
who you saw sneak away and
quietly pour the beer down the
sink; that guy who tried to
convince you, “I really do
smoke!” Would you want that
person for your president,
regardless of how smart he or
she was? Of course not. They
pretended to be something
they were not.

Imagine Bill Clinton, Mr.
Rhodes Scholarship,‘ too weak
“to just say no” and turn down
the offer of a puff of marijuana.
I guess I should feel sorry for
him — the poor guy. Buckling
under the pressure laden upon
him by those evil and ever-
oppressive college students. But
really I don’t feel sorry for him
and neither should you. I’m
disgusted by him.

— A person needs to show forti-

tude, not just try to act cool
and fit in. I sure as hell
wouldn’t want this phony run-
ning America.

Sit back and slack,
comics are back

By Jennifer N. Spagnuolo

_If you have been told comic books are juvenile and a
waste of time, don’t- fear’— the art trend of the ‘90s is
here. As of late, comic books are looked at more and
more for’ their artistry rather than content and story line,
which is in no way juvenile. _

Around since the late 1930s, comic books have been a
source of entertainment for much of America’s youth. Just
imagine our world as it is, minus the TV — don’t worry
it’s just a dream. Entertainment in those days included
radio shows and reading out loud —— OK the reading is
more Puritan. Anyway, kids were turning to superheroes
when they got bored of Amos and Andy and “Moby Dick”

Beginning with such characters as Superman and
Captain America, comic books grew to a phenomenal
height. Comic books are now reaching a much larger
audience than bored pre-teens. Even through generations

REM
Automatic For The People
Warner Brothers Records

Gentle—smooth southern com-
fort.

That’s the image that immedi-
ately engulfs the mind after lis-
tening to R.E.M.’s latest release,
Automatic For The People -— the
Athens-bred quartet’s ‘10th
album.

Beginning with the lumber-
some but seductive bass—driven
“Drive” and ending with the
equally half-speed slumber, “Find
The River,” Automatic is any-
thing but a conventional, run—of-
the-studio follow-up—to-a-smash

album. Then again, Bill Berry,
Peter Buck, Mike Mills and
Michael Stipe are no singular-
sound, run—of—the—retro band.
After hitting it bigger-than-big
in 1991 with the complex yet
user-friendly Out of Time, R.E.M.
has pulled back on the backbeat

~ and jangly geetars, opting instead

for a meshing of Violas, violins,
cellos  and a dose and a half
of Stipe’s emotiveyet simple
vocal gymnastics. The results? A
rich, ﬂowing 12—track work of
memorable warmth.

The sounds simmer from the
start with “Drive” —— the band’s
first single off the album —
thrives off the stark yet comfort-

ing violin/acoustic guitar plod-
ding and the dominant vocals of
Stipe.

The ensuing “maybe-this-
maybe-that” verbal tease that
conjures up a slew of slumber-
induced images of adamant yet
insecure solitude: “Maybe I ride,
maybe you walk/ Maybe I try to
get off  baby/ Hey, kids! Rock-
and-rol]/ nobody tells you where

to go  baby.” Classic example -

of a song that grows on the lis-
tener after repeated play.

For the legit rock romps, “The
Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite” is
R.E.M. at its upbeat best — re-
establishing, at least for a song,

Lori M. Bossert
Staff Writer

The City Th-eatre’s Cabaret Verboten
takes a look at both the past and pre-
sent in the form of songs and sketches
from the heyday of the _German
Cabaret. This irreverent piece provides
a political and social critique of both
Weimar Era Germany and America of
the ‘90s.

Cabaret was a popular art formlin
post World War I Germany, similar to
American vaudeville. However, where
vaudeville tended to reflect its ‘time,
the cabaret was an active source of

political satire and social critique. The
music and the broad comedy styles are
similar to those of vaudeville but have
a harsher undertone
American cousins. Vaudeville existed
primarily for entertainment, but the
cabaret was a vehicle for contemporary
criticism of both social and political
institutions and ideas.

Arranged chronologically, the show’s
songs and skits are like political car-
toons come to life. Similar to these car-
toons, the vignettes reflect the changes
in Germany’s political and social cli-
mate. The first act pokes good-natured
fun at the various issues they target,

The City Theatre presents Caberet Verboten

using light-hearted songs and carica-
ture-like skits with a satirical undercur-
rent.

The second act opens with a similar
song about the “new objectivity” that
was sweeping the land. However, it
quickly turns harsh and cold as the
actors attempt to joke about situations
with no inherent humor. In the chilling
“Tailor Fragment,” for example, toward
the show’s close a Jewish man shops
for a suit. As the sales clerk measures
him, his motions measure those made
for a coffin. There is nothing funny
anymore, just a grim, oppressive fear

Contmued from page 11
the band’s jangle/backbeat/lyrical
hook menage 2'1 trois trademark,
resulting in an unintelligible but
spry four—minute rockfest. It’s the
best up tempo song on the
album.

“Ignoreland” also hits the high
road to rumbleseat, jumping
from the start with a nasty bass—
drum takeoff. Using the hot
wattage as a adamant backdrop,
“Igr1oreland” mutters aimlessly —
much like its topic — about the
wretched political ambiguity
known as the United States gov-
ernment. It’s information over-
load — hot hitting info break-
down.

Another rocker — albeit a
toned-down jaunt — is “Man on
the Moon.” Structured with the
standard framework folk sound,
Stipe and Millscombine vocals to
harmonize about a variety of dis-
connected images. The result is a
three-minute question of trust
about society: “If you believe
they put a man on the moon/ if
you believe‘  there’s nothing
up their sleeve.”

Checking in as the first of
many quarter—tempo strolls, “Try
Not to Breathe” dares one to try
not to listen. Despite nabbing the
opening percussion snippet to
The Who’s “Magic Bus,”
“Breathe” grooves like an inspira-
tional hymnal — complete with
organ and mandolin accompani-
ment. Like the hollow acoustic
echo that encompasses
“Sweetness Follows,” “Breathe”
adheres to a pondering tone that

recalls the melody of the under-

rated Beatles’ classic, ,“You’ve
Got to Hide Your Love Away.”
Both are superb walks through
downscaled rock.

To follow that “superb” idea to
the Nth power are the poetic
rhythms of “Everybody  If
you’re in need for a serene song
that may elicit a tear or two, lis-

' ten to the first minute of the

emotion—drenched “Everybody
Hurts” — the best song on a
compilation filled with grade-A
material.

Crawling through the intro
with a lullaby guitar line,
“Everybody” leaves no heartfelt
vibe untouched. Stipe is again
the shining light, reassuring the
lonely and downtrodden that
things aren’t bad for just you -
they’re bad for everyone at one
time or another: “When your day
is long/ and the night  the
night is yours alone/and you’re
sure you’ve had enough  of
this life/ hang on  don’t let
yourself go/ cuz everybody
cn'es/ everybody hurts  some-
times.”

The‘ serenity continues in the
revering _ remembrance
“Nightswimming” I.—- a sweet

_ piano and strings-laden roller-

coaster of simple things gone by.
Stipe again_ dominates, this‘ time
cajoling images of one’s own
childhood joys . to emerge
through the course of listening‘ to
his uninhibited revelations: “It’s
not like years ago/ the fear of
getting caught/ the recklessness
of water/ they cannot see me
naked/ these things they go
away/ replaced by everyday.” It’s
a great song about things gone

this is intended to show
the loose relationship she
and Fabian have, it ends
up cheating the viewer
because her character is
underdeveloped and too
assuming.

Fabian and Al’s rela-
tionship also poses a
snag. It happens too mag-
ically; they instantly
become pals. Thankfully,
his character ﬁts too well
to care much. But it is
Fabian’s character who
earns the most screen

time. He is a self-con- '

sumed, quick—fix money
earner with a penchant to
earn self-respect by get-
ting rich quick. Along the
way he discovers that
boxing /is a brutal busi-
ness. He rants and raves
in typical De Niro fash-
ion, hyper and witty, but
are more speeches than
they are threats or intimi-
dation. As he deals with
people who don’t like

scious effort on his part

of sitcoms and reruns, the
interest is still there. But in our
‘90s visually stimulating world

— we have Nintendo andi

MTV to thank for that —
comics are no longer the plot
and dialogue that we craved
when we turned off the radio.
It is the art in the books that
we crave.

more people are buying comic

have improved drastically over
the last couple years.”

Zafris and his buddy John
Zaphyr opened the Comics
Crypt in November of 1991 —
both are graduates of the
University of Pittsburgh, class
of ‘86 and ‘87. Zafris claims his
comic collection was “the only
asset I had.” Noticing that the

closest comic book store to
Pitt was on South Craig Street,
the men thought it would be a
good idea to establish one
closer to campus.

Phantom of the Attic, locat-
ed on South Craig Street, is an
independently-owned chain
managed and owned by Jeff
Yandora. Phantom has been in

business since 1985. When
askedihow far back his love
for the comics goes he replied,
“My mother should have

Cabaret

Continued from page 12
which spills off the stage and into the
audience.

Jeremy Lawrence, the evening’s cre-
ator, uses only authentic German
Cabaret songs and sketches, including
works by Bertolt Brecht, Friedrich
Hollaender, Karl Valentin and Mischa
Spoliansky. All the material. ‘is
from original sources, with few
changes. After the show, Lawrence
noted in a quick interview that he
had not “modernized” the subject mat-
ter. . '

This is surprising, because Cabaret
Verboten is no museum piece.
Nothing appears musty or old—fash-
ionedin this engaging, fast—paced
evening of theater rife with satire per-
tinent to America of the ‘90s — partic-
ularly in an election year. Everything
comes under fire including feminism,
“trickle—down” economic theory, the
press, corruption, inﬂation, fashion,
racism, sexism and sexual freedom.
However, everything is also in context
for a post-World War I German audi-
ence. If in doubt, one needs only to
check the extensive program notes,
which provide a brief history of
Weimar Era Germany and the
cabarets, and list a source for each
song and sketch. Only one or two
lines are obvious additions, such as
the “family values” one-liner. But
these are few and do not break the
illusion that we have come into an
authentic German cabaret.

Excellent production values also
contribute to this show’s success. R.C.

Baker’s smoky, cool—toned lighting The

(3

crew fron1 the City Theatre's production of Caaret Verboten

 

and Rhoda Hartmann’s properties cre-
ate an atmosphere which is both
glamorous and gritty. The cast mem-
bers look like they’ve stepped out of a
1950s movie, thanks to designer
Lorraine Venberg’s excellent costumes
and makeup. The set is a colorized
collage of pop culture from Weimar

Germany. A blimp hovers over part of ‘

the set. Wide—eyed dancers smile out
at the audience. Although one might
wish for a more “authentic” cabaret
stage, this approach reminds us that
the evening is a chronological collage
of cabaret, and heightens the connec-
tion to our own time.

The cast is the final element that
makes this show succeed. Derek
Meader is a chatty, funny master of
ceremonies, capable of both the dra-
matic and comedic aspects of his role.
Willy, “the second banana,” is played
by Jon Bicsey with energy and a soar-
ing tenor voice that fills the theater.
Lenora Nemetz is a brassy, trampy
comedienne as the ﬂamboyant Gussy
— she writhes through her last num-
ber (“I Don’t Know Who I Belong
T0”) with anguished flair, providing
one of the show’s starkest images.
And Julia Collins is a delightful Trude,
the troupe’s danseuse/chanteuse. She
has a lovely, tongue-in—cheek sense of
comedy which works well for this
show, particularly on numbers like “A
Little Attila,” one of the highlights of
Act I. All four actors work well as an
ensemble, skillfully taking the audi-
ence from the high-pitched comedy
of the first act to the show’s cold clo-
sure. 7

This year he has been outstanding,

“We have some youngsters that are
coming in and finding out what col-
lege football is all about on the
defensive side of the football,” Logan
said. “I look up from time to time,
and we have got four freshmen in the
secondary. That makes your career

Anderson
takes ECU
QB position

By Rob Pugliese

Sports Assistant

Think of the top passing
offenses in Division I foot-
ball. " E

Visions that flash through

the mind might be of
Dennis Erickson’s Miami
Hurricanes or Steve

Spurrier’s Florida Gators.
But the number-one passing
attack in the nation will roll

directly into Pitt Stadium ’

this Saturday.

It is East Carolina, and its
leader is sophomore sensa-
tion Michael Anderson.

Anderson, a six-foot-four-
inch, 226-pound quarter-
back, entered this season
unknown to most college
football observers.

He was under the intense
pressure of replacing
departed superstar Jeff
Blake, who now serves as a
backup signal caller for the
New York Jets.

« East Carolina, not known
as a football powerhouse,
became one of the nation’s
dream stories last season,
finishing 11-1 largely due
to Blake’s heroic perfor-
mance.

While the 1992 Pirates
are struggling at 3-3, their
passing attack has not
dropped off.’ In fact, it
leads the country with 354
yards per game due to
Anderson’s dynamic abili-
ties.

In East Carolina’s 44-34
loss at Bowling Green,
Anderson broke Blake’s
single-game team records
for attempts, completions
and yardage by ‘hitting
33 of 55 passes for 379
yards.

Panther soccer kicks Canisius all over Pitt Stadium 6-0

By Bennett Zamoff
Staff Writer

Eric Prex scored a goal and
assisted on three others as
the Pitt soccer team rolled to
its easiest win this season, 6-
0 over Canisius University
last night at a frigid Pitt
Stadium.

Six different players scored
goals for the Panthers, who
manhandled a badly out-
matched ‘ Golden Griffins
team from the opening whis-
tle to the final horn.

Pitt improved its. record to
10-4, marking just the third
time in Panther soccer’s 24-
year history that the team has
won 10 games.

There was never any doubt
as to who was in control in
the Panthers’ second straight

win, with Pitt coming out
strong and asserting control
with a slew of opportunities
and rushes in the game’s
opening minutes. 0

It only took the Panthers
eight minutes to turn one of
those opportunities into a
goal. Sophomore midfielder
Charlie Wasson beat Canisius

‘goaltender Nick Christou

with a shot from about 15
yards out to put Pitt up 1-0.
The blast was Wasson’s first
goal this season.

' Just 57 seconds later,
another Panther, who had
yet to score this year, got in
on the act.

This time Eric Prex found
first-year player ].L. Gorsin
open on the left side of the
field, about 20 yards in front
of the goal. Gorsin blasted a

shot over the outstretched
arm of a disgruntled Christou
to put Pitt up'2-Q, 

Panther Coach Joe
Luxbacher credited those two
quick goals with the team’s
charge to victory.

“We scored two goals early
and that changed the whole
complexion of the game,”
Luxbacher said. “Then they
opened up, and when they
opened up that gave us a lot
more space in the back. It
sort of snowballed from
there.”

“Snowballed” means one
more goal that half and three
more in the second half.

The Panthers’ third goal
came via Prex, their leading
scorer this season, on a
penalty shot. -

Prex’s score — his seventh

goal this year — was espe-
cially satisfying for the
sophomore midfielder since
he was stopped on a penalty
shot in the.Panthers’ 1-0 vic-
tory over Villanova a month
ago. -

“It was  a confidence
builder,” Prex said. “There
was no way he could stop
that, too. It was a good
shot.”

“The penalty shot was big
for his confidence,”
Luxbacher said. “Prex usually
makes those, and we just
wanted _him to get back on
track.”

_ Walter Lamory scored his
secondlgoal this season to
give the Panthers a 4-0
advantage midway through
the second half. First-year
sensation Dean Astorino

notched his seventh goal this
year with 11 minutes remain-
ing to put,'Pitt up 5-0. _

Midfielder Ted Noethling
added his second\_goa1 this
year with less than two min-
utes to go to complete the 6-
0 whitewashing.

The game was a productive
one for Coach Luxbacher and
his team not just because of
the barrage of goals but
because he was able to use
the game as an opportunity
to give some players who
have not seen much playing
time this year a chance to
contribute.

This included back-up
goaltender Ki_rk Brodows,
who played the entire sec-
ond half as first-year starting
netminder Adam Spitzer took

Scboolboys are back for Homecoming

By Brian Berger
and Rob Pugliese
The Pitt News

After a humiliating month of
having our column space
macheted, the Schoolboys
return, Homecoming style. Like
the alumni, we are coming back
eager to improve upon our
wasteful 3-3 mark. No losing
juice this week.

Arizona Wildcats (3-2-1) at
Cal Bears (3-3) -3

The feisty Cal squad returns
home after two hard-fought

losses on the PAC-10 road,

dropping to Washington and
succumbing late to Southern
Cal. '

- Tailback Russell ‘White missed
the Trojan game with a groin
injury but is’ expected back
against a vastly improved

- Wildcat h1m(_‘.h. His presence is

the difference here as the Bears
are able to return to a balanced
offense and look to cover for
the sixth time in seven games in
the series. Cal is a money earn-
ing a 9-0 mark against the num-
ber in Berkeley the last"season
and a half.

Both squads are 4-2 against
thegspread in ‘92, but the year
has belonged to the Wildcats
thanks to a stifling defense
which appears to have come
from nowhere. Coach Dick
Tomey, with seven starters
returning on D, has his team

‘believing and allowing a total of

17 points against Miami (Fla.),
UCLA and Stanford the last
three weeks —- and has every-
body else believing, including
Las Vegas odds-makers who are
offering this game at an afford-
able price. N

benefitting from scheduling.
They played Miami the week
before the Florida State match
and upset Stanford last week
(KO—ing QB Steve Stenstrom)
after the Cardinal experienced
two grueling road matches at
Notre Dame and UCLA.

Don’t believe the hype here.
California is in desperate need
of a W and home field is the
charm. The PAC-10 as a whole
is overrated and Arizona is play-
ing way above its talent level.
Look for a balanced Cal “O” to
move the ball and come up
with the big plays. Earth to
Arizona. Take Cal-3. .

East Carolina Pirates (3-3)
at Pitt Panthers (3-4) -5 -

This game features two of the
worst defenses around and two
of the elite passing attacks.
You’ll see yards, lots of them,
and possibly 75 or 80 points in

this game. ECU leads the coun-
try with 354 passing yards per
game, and Pitt’s not far behind.
Alex Van Pelt has been red hot
the last four games and should
sizzle against toast-fry Pirate
secondary.

The Pitt defenders are still
reeling and look to have their
hands full as well with sopho-
more Michael Anderson and the
ECU “O.” But let’s be realistic.
East Carolina gave up 44 points
to Bowling Green and 45 to
Duke. .

Pitt should get back to .500
here, looking for revenge from
last year’s shocking back—and-
forth affair at Greenville. Like
that game, this one should
come down to who has the ball
last. Panther Pride ‘92, let’s at
least start getting some revenge.
Take Pitt -5.

Freeman
runs into
Big Easts

By Matt Groff
Sta_ﬁ"Writer

Balancing a schedule of
Division—I cross country and
serving in Army ROTC on
top of an 18—credit course
load may sound exhausting
to most students, but Pitt
senior Waddie Freeman
says he wouldn’t have it
any other way.

As he prepares for the
Big East Championships on
Saturday, Freeman says he
is proud of what is behind
him.

“I’ve been through a lot
in the past couple of years,”
Freeman said.“But I don’t
think I’d change any of it if
I could. I’m really a better
person and an improved
athlete because of my expe-
rience.”

Freeman says his life was
changed by his decision to
join the Anny in December
of 1987. This decision came
during his junior year after
transferring to Pitt his
sophomore year from
Michigan State University.
He cited academic struggle
and a career—jeopardizing

Davis rrns into gap
left by Bouyer injury

By Mike Johns
Staff Writer «

College football is a game
of ups and downs. A player
could be at the top of his
game having a record year,
and then an injury strikes.

Chris B.ouyer was leading
the Big East conference in
receiving this year before
he had a career-ending
neck injury two weeks ago
against Notre Dame.
Bouyer was a quality
receiver who benefitt_ed
from a passing scheme
developed by Pitt’s head
coach Paul Hackett. '

Bill Davis has stepped in

as Pitt’s starting flanker’

going into Saturday’s game
against East Carolina.
According to Pitt receivers
coach Mike McCarthy, the
Panthers should not miss a
beat with Davis in there.
“He is the starting
ﬂanker, and the flanker in
our offense is a very impor-
tant guy,” McCarthy said.
“Davis had a great role
model in Bouyer, but he
has a little more speed than
Bouyer did. He [Davis] did

a great job last week
against Temple for us.
Davis is a guy that has
stepped to the front, and
we’re going to push him a
little more this week.
Everything we asked him to
do so far, he has done.”
According to McCarthy,
Davis "is a player that
should give the Panthers a

quality receiver for two _l

more seasons.
“Davis is going to be in a

‘position that is going to

make it possible for him to
make many plays for us,”
McCarthy said. “Our
offense is rated fourth in
the country in passing this
year. So it’s obvious that
we are successful in throw-
ing the ball around. He
[Davis] is an intelligent kid
who knows the system very
well, and he pays attention
to detail very well. All
Davis needs is to get game
experience.” V

That experience is com-
ing, and confidence ‘comes
with it.

“I feel pretty good, and I
feel as though the coaching

Men's X-country faces national powers

By Jason Feuchtwanger
For The Pitt News

Pitt faces three of the top 20 teams in the
nation as the Panthers look to improve on
last year’s fourth place finish at the Big East
Cross Country Championships on Saturday.

Defending Big East. Champs Providence,
ranked fourth, Villanova fifth and
Georgetown is 17th in the nation.

The number one returning runner at the
tournament is two—time All—American
Terrance Mahon of Villanova.‘

While Providence does not have one star
as does Villanova, it possesses something
just as important —- plenty of quality run-

ners.

“Providence has tremendous depth,” Pitt
Coach Jim Lear said. “Georgetown is also
very good and is ranked nationally. This is a
very big race for us.”

Junior Mike Lynn pointed to what must.

happen if Pitt is to pull off the upset. -
“The key for us to do well is a tight group-
ing of our top five runners,” Lynn said.
“Georgetown is at the same level as us, so it
will be close.” I
Pitt enjoys a top five that consists of both
youth and experience. Senior co-captain
Waddle Freeman leads the team with Lynn,
sophomore Frank Nesko is not far behind.

Grandison adds to rise of ECU

By Stephen Flinn
Staff Writer

Most high school athletes attend the
college program that they feel will do
the most for them — not Greg
Grandison.

He said that he chose East Carolina’
because he thought it was the program
thatxhe could do the most for.

“I chose ECU because I thought it was
an up and coming program, and I want-
ed to help put ECU on the map,”
Grandison said.

His list of possible choices included
Oklahoma State, -Ole Miss and Mississippi

State. But he instead chose to play for
the East Carolina Pirates, who are defi-
nitely on the map now. This previously-
unknown school had its best season in
school history last year with an 11-1
record. »

Grandison is the starting safety for the
Pirates and is an All—American candidate
picked by The Sporting News as a pre-
season favorite for the Jim Thorpe award,
which is given to the nation’s top defen-
sive back.

Grandison is best known for his fero-
cious hitting. He recorded 100 tackles
last year combining solos and assists, so

staff has alot of confidence in
rne,” Davis said. “I have been
here_as long as most of the
previous starters. I am young
in respect to my playing time,
but I adjusted to the wide
receiver role pretty well. In
my opinion, I’m going to be a

force to be reckonedewith.”

Davis said that he is ready
to be pushed into a bigger
role in ‘Coach Hackett’s
offense.

“When the coaches say that
they want to push me in hav-
ing a bigger role in the
offense,iit just tells me how
much of a big weapon that

the coaches think I can be,”
Davis said.

Davis and Bouyerboth pos-
sess good hands and run good
routes, but there are some dif-
ferences between the two
receivers.

“I learned a lot from Chris
[Bouyer]. He showed me many
things, but we are two differ-
ent types of receivers,” Davis
said. “Chris was a prototype

-receiver with great ﬁnesse. He

had great knowledge of the
game. He new how to work
people, and he showed it by
becoming the leading receiver
in the Big East.

_“I am more of a power wide

receiver. -1 use my speed,
strength and quickness to get
open on the field.”

Davis said -that he is looking
for big things in his Pitt
career. ,_

“I look for big things this
year and in my career,” Davis
said. “I think I have potential
to be a great player, but some-
times saying you have poten-
tial makes it seem like you’ll
never get there. I have a lot to

learn, and the more I learn, ‘

the better I’ll be. It is just a
matter of getting me the ball

. once I get the ball, we’ll
just have to see what hap-
pens.”

Clemson Tigers (4-2) at N.C.
State Wolfpack (5-2-1) -1 1/2

The Tigers have come on
strong after consecutive heart-
breaking losses to Florida State
and Georgia -Tech early in the
season. They stunned Virginia

- in Charlottesville two weeks

ago, coming back from a 28-0
deficit to win 29-28. Last week
they _pasted an inconsistent
Duke squad. _

N .C. State pretty much exem-
plifies the entire Atlantic Coast
Conference — thelteam is
unpredictable. It has beaten
quality opponents (Iowa and
North Carolina), and it trashed a
solid Texas Tech club 48-13.
N.C. State lost to Georgia Tech
and tied an awful Virginia Tech
outﬁt 13-13 last week.

With the Citrus Bowl bid wide
open, look for the Wolfpack to
come out fired up at home
against a hurting Tiger offense.
Tailback Rodney Blunt is ques-
tionable with a hamstring injury,
and redshift frosh QB Solomon
is out with a knee injury from
the Duke game. Solomon had
sparked the Tiger offense in its
recent surge. The N.C. State

offensive line is banged up as
well, so expect a low-scoring
affair on Tobacco Road.

The ‘Pack has long been
Clemson’s nemesis, covering the
line 18 of their past 21 meetings
and splitting the past six
matchups despite being the
underdog every time. N.C. State
is a bankable 13-3 in its last 16
versus the number. Clemson’s
fire power is seriously dimin-
ished and its one-dimensional
rushing attack is nothing new to
an aggressive Wolfpack bunch.
This is Clemson’s toughest
remaining game and believe
that State will show ‘em why.
Take NC State -1 1/2.

Bonus baby: parlay, parlay, par-
lay.

Vanderbilt (2-4) -6 1/ 2 vs.
South Carolina (1-5)

The woeful Gamecocks
shocked Mississippi State last
week, but don’t expect the
same here. Vandy returns home
with the alumni after hangin’
tough at Georgia last week. SC
rookie QB Steve Tanneyhill
makes first road start against
hostile Commodore squad, but
we are not eager to lay an
inﬂated number. Take Vandy -6

he is definitely making his
presence felt.

“I love to hit, I love the
contact. I enjoy hitting,”
Grandison said.

It is Grandison’s knowl-
edge of his team’s defense
that ECU head coach Steve
Logan appreciates most.

“Greg gets us lined up in
the right defensive sets —
that’s_ comforting. He is a
key due to the rest of the
secondary now
being all freshman,” Logan
said.

This is Logan’s‘first year
as head coach at ECU and
it’s taken some time for
Grandison to adjust to the
new coach.

“I still knew what was
expected of me this year,
but I’m not quite sure how I
am expected to play,”
Grandison said. “Last year I
was all over the field. This
year I am being a little more
cautious.”

He is hoping for a shot in
the NFL and stated emphati-
cally what team he would
most like to play for.

“The Raiders — I love the
silver and black,” Grandison
said.

But if he doesn’t make it
in the NFL, his education
will still allow Grandison to
stay close to sports.

“My major is communica-

1 tions, but I’m specializing in

broadcasting. Those are my
favorite classes,” Grandison

said. “They’ll help me in my ,

future, because someday ‘I
want to be a sports analyst
on TV.”

Swartout is coming

injury as the reasons for this deci-
sion.

“Going to Michigan State right
out of highschool was over-
whelming  so far away from
home and I didn’t know anyone,”
Freeman said. “When I came to
Pitt, I think I got too caught up
and distracted byithe social life, it
really took away from my school
and athletic performance.”

According to Freeman,
he reported to boot camp directly
from his Lothrop residence in
what he calls one of the best
decisions of his life. He said he
gained maturity, discipline and
confidence during his four years
as he rose through the ranks to
sergeant, working as a military
analyst.

He retumed to Pitt in January of

1992 with a new outlook and cer-

“I had seen him run when he was
a senior in high school, he was a

had a lot of talent When he first
came to Pitt he was a real good
runner, but I don’t think he knew
how much he was capable of
achieving. Since he came back last
January,.I’ve found that his confi-
dence is meshing his ability and
great work ethic. He really brings
leadership to the team.”

Freeman has been a mainstay in
the top ﬁnishers for Pitt this year,
just as he was in 1987. In his last

two competitions, he finished on

top at the City Championship and
19th at the Notre Dame
Invitational to lead all Pitt runners.

Freeman is also an accom-
plished runner in indoor and out-
door track for Pitt, but he says that
he likes the challenges of cross
country.

“When running in an open ﬁeld
instead of a track, the mind has a
tendency to wander, and it can be
difficult to keep focus,” Freeman
said. “I think my discipline from
the Armyreally forces me to keep
my concentration and produces a
competitive edge.”

He says that this cross country
season has progressed well for
him personally, but he is looking
forward to competing as a team
this Saturday at the Big East
Championships in Boston

“This season we’ve all been
developing together, the team as

one,” Freeman said. “We rely on
everyone to do their job, it hasn’t
been an individual thing. I’ve seen

improvement from everyone on V

team and that is important If one
person has a bad day, the team
will pick him up.”

According to Freeman, this
Saturday’s contest including sever-
al nationally-ranked teams, will be
a strong test of the Panther squad"
He says he feels they can make a
strong_showing if they can stick
together and pull through as a
team.

“We can’t worry about who
we’re running against and what
everyoneielse is doing,” Freeman
said. “If everyone keeps their con-
centration and confidence
throughout the race, we’ll do well.
Personally, I hope to use my own
experience to push the team to its
potential.”

Anderson

Continued from page P-2

Six games into the campaign,
Anderson has already sm’ashed
every sophomore record for East
Carolina quarterbacks. He has com-
pleted 146 of 257 passes for 1,750
yards with 15 touchdownsand
13 interceptions. But his inexperi-
ence occasionally shows when

.Anderson commits youthful mis-

takes.
First-year Pirate head coach Steve
Logan ‘_ has gradually eased

Anderson into the offense with a
very unique system, designed to
coax Anderson’s raw potential into
consistent productivity.

Anderson does not start the
game. He watches from the side-

lines for ‘one series as senior Sean
McConnell’ directs the first drive of
the game.‘ .

“It gives him time to digest what
is taking place on the field,” Logan
said. '

“It gives him a chance to come off
the bench, and when~he goes out
there he sees what the coverages
and fronts are.”

Anderson’s sizeand athletic abili—"

ty are two of his strongest assets,
but both Logan and Pitt head coach
Paul Hackett said that they see
countless other skills in the man
known as “Satellite.”

“I say ‘quarterback’ in the truest
sense of the word. He’s not just an
athlete. He’sva very bright young

THE PITT NEWS, Saturday, October 24, 1992

man,” Logan said. “He” has a good
arm -—— not a gun, but a good arm.
He’s an extremely accurate thrower
and hasla great gift of accuracy.

“I don’t know of any sophomore
quarterbacks that are doing what
he’s doing. Michael is well ahead
ofthe pace of guys like Jeff Blake,”
Logan said.

That’s quite a statement consider-
ing Blake graces the top of every
Pirate passing chart, has earned
considerable support in last year’s
Heisman Trophy race and left East
Carolina a fifth—round draft choice
in April. _

Those who believed Blake's
performance was an aberration
for Pirate quarterbacks may finally

take notice of the man who
appears capable of heading all
future ECU passing lists. For
Anderson, the question is not if,
but when. ,

“This guy is a classic pro football
type of quarterback,” Hackett said.

“‘He’s a straight, drop—back proto-

type, in-the—pocket, drop-back-and-
fire-the-ball-straight-downfield
quarterback. He’s going to be one
of the top quarterbacks in -the
country.”

Hackett and the vulnerable Pitt‘

defense will get an up—close oppor-
tunity to gauge Anderson’s devel-
opment facing an offense that
throws the football 75 percent of
the time.

While the offense seemed

“The touirnarnent was a
lot of fun,” s-Kenkel ’said..—..
"‘The other teams were
enthused about us joining
the league. The competi-
tion is stronger, but I think
we will do very well.”

i The Panthers’ next home

game will be this Sunday
against Penn State at 2 p.m.
in the Cost Center.

This will mark the: first

time the two teams have
met on the lacrosse field
and, as head coach Gary
Neft explained, it will
be the biggest test for his
team so far in this young
season.

“Every year they finish in
the top five oriysix in our
league,” Neft said

“I know they will be
good?
