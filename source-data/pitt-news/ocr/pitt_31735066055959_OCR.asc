Fatal jump from Cathedral

Former student is second suicide in three months

Ben Jackson
Editor-in-Chief

On Monday evening, the
Cathedral of. Learning was
the scene of another sui-
cide when a former Pitt stu-
dent jumped from the 32nd
floor. »

The Allegheny County
Coroner’s office said that
the death had been ruled a
suicide on Tuesday after-
noon.

The City Police said the
victim was 27-year-old
Sharon Ann Shelton.

Shelton allegedly jumped at
approximately 5:30 yester-
day evening and was seen
falling by someone else in
the building, who dialed
911.

Police said it was
unknown how she gained
access to the ledge from
which she jumped. Pitt
Police Chief Rick Boyd
said that the police think
she may have gotten onto
the roof from a higher
floor. The ledge was on the
Bellefield Avenue side of
the Cathedral of Learning.

Michelle Amato of the

Pitt public relations office
told The Pitt News that
Shelton had been a student
at Pitt from September
1990 to April 1993. The
registrar’s office said she
had received a certificate in
women’s studies and a B.A.
in liberal studies.

This is the second suicide
on campus in three months.
The first was over last
term’s spring break in early
March. John Solot, a Pitt
student in the College of
Arts and Sciences, jumped
from the 35th floor.

Senate limits student-faculty relationships

 

Ben Jackson
Editor-in-Chief

The Senate Council met Monday afternoon
to discuss the revised policy on faculty—stu—
dent relationships, the evolving policy
regarding conﬂicts of interest during federal-

ly-funded research a'n*d'th’e' possibility of ‘

revoking the Medical Center’s right to use
the University’s name.

The first major item discussed was the poli-
cy regarding consensual sexual relations
between faculty members and their students,
a policy which caused a stir when first pro-
posed.

The new revision states that “the University
prohibits intimate relationships between a
faculty member and a student whose academ-
ic work, teaching or research is being super-
vised or evaluated by the faculty member.” It
defines a ‘faculty member’ as “anyone
appointed by the University as a teacher,
researcher or academic administrator, includ-
ing graduate and undergraduate students so
appointed.” An ‘intimate’ relationship
includes sexual or “romantic” relationships.

In addition to the new definitions, the poli-
cy was amended by the council to read that
any transgressions may cause the faculty
member to lose legal aid from the University.

A question was raised over what was meant
by the word ‘romantic’ and what was meant
by the word ‘may.’ The members of the com-
mittee who produced the policy said they
were leaving room for all the various situa-
tions which could arise.

The council next discussed a conflict of
interest policy for faculty engaged in federal-
ly funded research. All Pitt faculty submit-
ting a research proposal must adhere to the
policy, which requires a researcher not to
engage in activities in which the potential for
personal gain might affect the integrity of his

or her research or relationship with the uni-
versity.

A related proposal for a policy on the com-
mercialization of research work was tabled
until the Staff Association Council could
examine it. The policy is designed to help
restrain University faculty who might want to
pursue entrepreneurial interests and at the
same time to protect the‘ University from law-
suits.

Finally, a proposal was made by Christina
Paulston at the April 8 meeting that the
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center not
be allowed to use the title ‘University of
Pittsburgh.’ This motion was brought up
from the table again at Monday’s meeting.
Paulston said that she didn’t think it was ben-
eficial to the University’s public image. She
also noted that the fact that UPMC is in the
process of buying up a number of hospitals
makes fund raising difficult, since the
University appears to have excess money.

Paulston was supported by Gordon
Macleod from the Health Services
Administration, who cited hard times ahead
in funding and confusion by the public over
whether the hospital was part of the universi-
ty or not as good reasons for the change.

“Even the employees of UPMC are con-
fused about their own relationship to the
University of Pittsburgh,” Macleod said.

The University had licensed the name to
the hospital sometime around the time
President Posvar left and Chancellor
O’Connor came in, but no one present was
certain who actually gave the license. It was
suggested that the Senate Council recom-
mend to the Chancellor that UPMC no longer
be allowed to use the name.

The motion was tabled for a second time,
this time until October, when more informa-
tion will be available. Senate Council will
meet for the last time this summer on June

The Office. of Student
Affairs has suspended its
third fraternity for hazing this
year. Phi Kappa Theta’s char-
ter has been revoked for a
minimum of one year, effec-
tive immediately, according
to a report issued by Assistant
Vice Chancellor for Student
Affairs Dennis Donham.

As a result of the sanction,
the fraternity’s lease for on-
campus housing has been ter-
minated. The University is
going to reassign all members
to other University housing.
While Phi Kappa Theta is
banned from the house, the
university can reassign it to
another fraternity.

Joe Cavalla, director of stu-
dent activities, said that the
University is looking into
placing another fraternity in
the house, but that no candi-
dates have been named yet.

Phi Kappa Theta can now
appeal the decision to Leon
Haley, vice chancellor for stu-
dent and public affairs.
Though no one from the fra-
ternity could be reached to
comment on Donham’s deci-
sion or the possibility of an
appeal, Jim Marcin, the coor-
dinator for the national frater-
nity of Phi Kappa Theta,

endorsed the University’s
decision.

“They had a fair and just
trial within the University,
and we, as a national fratemi-
ty, continue to explore our
options with the University,”
Marcin said.

Marcin said that Phi Kappa
Theta was exploring the pos-
sibility of an appeal within
the University as well as
other options, including reor-

two other
Pitt fratemi-
ties, Sigma
Phi Epsilon
and Kappa
Alpha Psi, had been suspend-
ed for hazing within the past
year. Another fraternity, Phi
Gamma Delta, is also being
investigated on unrelated haz-
ing charges.

Sigma Phi Epsilon was first
suspended by its national
office for a hazing incident
involving alcohol and later
suspended until April 1997
by the Office of Student
Activities. According to
Cavalla, that sentence has

   

been lightened to a suspen-
sion until fall 1996 after the
fraternity appealed to Haley.
Kappa Alpha Psi was also
suspended indefinitely after
five suspects, one of which
was a Pitt student, were
arrested for their involvement
in a beating that put two
pledges in the hospital. The
suspects have been charged
with two counts of aggravat-
ed assault, two counts of
recklessly endangering anoth-
er person and one count of
criminal conspiracy. Their
trial is upcoming - in
Allegheny Common Pleas
Court. ‘
The decision on Phi Kappa
Theta comes after a recent
drug raid at» the Pi Lambda
Phi fraternity house which
resulted in eight arrests, six
of which were Pitt students.
Last fall a “Greek
Imperative lnitiative” was
formed by the Office of
Student Affairs, organizing a
committee to create a list of
recommendation to Haley
about overhauling the Greek
system, especially in the
areas of rush season and alco-
hol policies. According to
Cavalla, the committee’s rec-
ommendations have been sub-
mitted to Haley. Haley will
now take a couple weeks to
review the recommendations
before making any decisions.

UPMC takes over Aliquippa, begins
negotiations with Washington

Russ Krebs
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center has merged
with Aliquippa Hospital and
will extend its services into
the Beaver County region at
the end of the month.

Aliquippa, a 183—bed acute
care hospital, will be the sec-
ond hospital this year that "the

Mill about 10 years ago.
When this happened, the area
lost over 15,000 jobs, and
many of these people had to
move elsewhere for employ-
ment.

“J & L workers were our
paying customers; they’re
gone now,” Zernich said.

Jane Duffield, director of

UPMC, said that, in addition

UPMC recently merged
with the former South
Side Hospital. Once this
UPMC acquisition is
finalized, the hospital
will be renamed UPMC
Beaver Valley.

A third UPMC merger
may take place within
the next year. Last week,
the Washington Hospital
Board of Trustees voted
to enter into discussions
with the UPMC. The two
organizations will develop a
framework for “combining
their resources” during the

next six to nine months,-

according to statements made
by the president and chief
executive officer of
Washington Hospital in a
UPMC report.

“The acquisition of
Aliquippa Hospital by the
UPMC ensures the future of
this organization that has
served the citizens of
Aliquippa and the surrounding
communities for 39 years,”
said George Ehringer, the
Aliquippa Hospital
Association board chairman.

The acquisition came at a
financially vital time for
Aliquippa. Like many hospi-
tals, Aliquippa was losing
money. According to Dr.
Stephen Zernich, a Pitt gradu-
ate who has been affiliated
with the hospital since before
its inception in 1957, much of
the problem had to do with

allow that.”

According to Zernich,
HMO’s were a big part of
Aliquippa’s financial prob-
lems.

“The HMO’s came in and
made an already bad situation
worse for us,” Zernich said.
“We used to honor Health
America. Then they discontin-
ued their use of this hospital,
and we lost even more
patients.

“Thirty years ago, if I

tise and financial
resources available to
Aliquippa, the reason
for the acquisition of
the hospital was to give
UPMC a presence in

Beaver Valley.
According to
Duffield, UPMC

intends to establish a

presence in the commu—_

nities surrounding
Aliquippa by opening
primary care physi-
cians’ offices that will be
affiliated with the hospital.
Zernich feels that this will
help with the re—emergence of
the hospital in the area.
“Aliquippa Hospital is a
good hospital with good doc-

tors,” Zernich said. “We just

need to have more doctors to
refer people to us. The UPMC
will help us with this — they
are necessary for our survival.
They gave us a shot in the arm
financially, both to take care
of old debts and to buy new
equipment. The UPMC offi-
cials have been superb and
very cooperative with us.”

incarceration. If we investmore in education, we might not have to
invest as much in incarceration.” ’

Tim Reeves, Ridge s press secretary, put a different face
on things. According to Reeves, education is still the number one
priority of the Pemis lvania Government. He said that 43 percent
of the state budgebis devoted to education, and Ridge’s proposals
for education come ' the context of the state getting $600 million
less from the federal government next year. The corporate tax cuts
that Walko mention according to Reeves, are job-creation tax
credits. . l

“This is the ﬁrs te budget in 25 years that spends less than the
year before,” Reeves said. “The average line item decreased slight-
ly this year. Education was held steady, and corrections got an
increase because we’ve built new prisons and think it would be a
good idea to put guards in them. VV1th reduced federal funding, the
state has been forced to make some tough decisions.”

Nationally, it looked as if educational funding was going to take
a hit when House Majority Leader Dick Arrney suggested cutting
education ﬁmding in order to pay for an eduction in the gas tax. In
a telephone interview, Sen. Rick Santorum said that this proposal
would probably not go anywhere.

“It’s Dick Armey being Dick Aimey. He’s saying there’s a lot of
money around for cutting,” Santorum said. “We’re actually cutting
from the department of energy. There’s lots of money to be saved.”

Sex with faculty not safe sex

Monday, the University Senate Council
approved a policy regarding faculty-student relation-
ships. It has now moved to the next level.

The policy says: “The University prohibits inti-
mate relationships between a faculty member and _a stu-
dent whose academic work, teaching or research is
being supervised or evaluated by the faculty member.”
It defines a faculty member as anyone appointed by the
University as a teacher or academic researcher, and this
includes both graduate and undergraduate students who
may have any such responsibilities.

This policy is designed to protect the University
and faculty members from charges of sexual harass-
ment. While it may do this, there are a number of ancil-
lary protections that probably should not be over-
looked in this policy. ‘

The first is the protection for the faculty. The
policy lessens the possibility that there will be sexual
harassment charges filed. At the same‘ time, however, it
also makes the faculty member safe from other types of
harassment. ~ '

V Imagine, for instance, if the students and faculty
were given a blank check on relationships how the open
response section on teacher evaluations would change.
The possibilities on those blank lines would be endless,
if not uncomfortable.

Also, with the Student Government Board plan
to publish class guides based on more informal student
evaluations, the possibility that one professor might be
publicly humiliated — or, at the other extreme, have his
or her class mobbed by young hopefuls — is just too
great a risk.

This policy protects the students in other ways
as well. Should some unfortunate Joe College student
have an amorous relationship with the professor of his
eight o’clock, there would be fewer excuses for him not
to make it to class. Can he really say “I was too tired
after last night to make it to class”? Or alternately, if he
was too tired to make it to class and couldn’t explain

where he was last night, this may lead-to very uncom-
- fortable”situa'tions all around, and these discussions are

the kinds best carried on elsewhere.

The students do, however, lose one form of pro-
tection from all of this: namely, the student now has no
excuse for the terrible grade he got on an exam. When

he has an amorous relationship with a professor, the

professor knows why he hasn’t been studying — the
student has been too busy being amorous. Since the
other students who are busy being amorous with each
other have none of this protection, it seems only fair
that those sleeping with their professors not have it
either.

Student leaders co-opted too early

Nichole
Gantshar

David Ifshin was only 47
when cancer stopped his politi-
cal career. He had been a radical
student leader who mellowed as
he grew older but never forgot
how to bring_ about social
change.

When he was president of
the National Student
Association in 1970, Ifshin

traveled to North Vietnam and‘

asked the U.S. troops in South
Vietnam to put down their
weapons.

It’s not somthing he would
have said 20 years later, but
Ifshin’s role had changed by
then. The older Ifshin was a
policy-maker and had to be a
compromiser.‘

That’s appropriate behavior
for someone of his status. It’s
not appropriate for students.

Today students are too quick
to compromise.

Ifshin’s transition from radi-
cal to mainstream politics
makes sense. Ifshin was a lead-
ing Washington, D.C. attorney
and took full advantage of its
perks. What’s the excuse of stu-
dent leaders? '

Several years ago I met with
Ifshin to ask him to help me
raise money for the United
States Student Association (the
name of the NSA since 1978)
and its foundation. Ifshin joked
he didn’t need the foundation
anymore because “under
Reagan’s tax changes no one
needs the deduction.”
Financially, he had come a long
way from his radical student
past. Yet his commitment to fair
public policy did not waiver.

Ifshin’s passing reminds me
of what I have lost as I have
become older, and the activist
zeal of my undergraduate days
has been co—opted into the

mainstream establishment way '

of working.
It makes me sad to see that

so many student leaders have
already made the transition
from rebel to co—opted bureau-
crat.

Students should not be like
Ifshin in his 40s; they need
some of that spark of Ifshin the
student leader. They also need
to understand that politics is
about dialogue. Ifshin knew that
his entire life. He was part of
the American Israeli Political
Action Committee. AIPAC
doesn’t like to compromise, but
understands it is inevitable, so it
frames its agenda issues in
black and white.

There can’t be room for
compromise in the beginning.
Policy changes aren’t black and
white. Social change occurs
after much compromise. If
activists start in the middle,
there can be no room for com-
promise. '

The lessons Ifshin learned as
a student activist remained true
throughout his career. Take a
position, a strong position, and
move towards the center only
when you have to.

Compromises go on every
day. Ifshin was. known for being
a strong early supporter of Bill
Clinton. Yet he took on that role
once he realized his first choice
for president, conservative
Senator Sam Nunn, would not
run.

What room for compromise
will exist if the student leaders
don’t make outrageous
demands? Why are today’s stu-
dent leaders speaking like Ifshin
of 1990 rather than Ifshin of
1970? How will they even earn
seats at the bargaining table if
there is nothing left to bargain?

In the 1990s Ifshin bar-
gained from the position of
power broker. Students have
their own unique bargaining
position.

“How can I listen to Scott?”
a state senator once joked to me
aboutthe president of our
state’s student lobby organiza-
tion. “His suits are more expen-

sive than mine!”

The senator thought if a stu-8 ’

dent could afford a $500 suit,
obviously he didn’t need lower
tuition or more financial aid.
Scott started dressing in. jeans
when he visited a legislator.

“If you’re going to represent
students, you better look like a
student,” Scott told me as he
went to give a speech at a rally
dressed in overalls.

Today Scott is back in suits
and walks the halls of Capitol
Hill representing the interests of
hospitals and businesses. Scott,
like Ifshin, made the transition
from student activist to bureau-
crat. '

But why are today’s student
leaders making that transition as
soon as they arepelected to
office?

The political process will
not work if the most liberal
force on a college campus is the
College Democrats.

Students have their whole
lives to work at being reason-
able, taken seriously and being
productive. Why start out that
way at 21?

Sure, someone has to be the
reasonable one who will go into
the university president’s office
and wear the suit. But who will
help position the student wear-
ing the suit as the voice of com-
promise? The radical empowers
the compromiser. In order for
the student wearing the suit to
compromise, hundreds of others
need to be extreme, outrageous
and downright obnoxious.

David Ifshin had a short
time to make his noise and he
took full advantage of it. There
were people who didn’t like
him. But Ifshin never shied
away from making his voice
heard. His position shifted from
working against the establish-
ment to working with it, but his
voice never wavered-. Student
leaders need to do the same.

' board member of the United

It goes a little something

This has been done

Attempt now to scan your

The titan of the league
that season rested in .

through the regular season,
in a similar fashion to this

squad, winning the
President’s Cup, which goes

‘ to the team with the best

regular season record.

Wouldn’t it be nice if the '

did. The Minnesota North

into the playoffs, upset them
in the first round. The Stars,

They did. After trailing two
games to none, former All-
Star (current chump) Kevin
Stevens guaranteed a series
victory for the Pens.
Everybody from Don
Cherry to Zarley Zalapski
balked at such a bold state-
ment. But they did win the
series. From that point on,
winning Lord Stanley was a
formality.

Now let’s return to your
favorite watering hole,
where you’re still gathered
with fellow Penguin fans.

Wouldn’t it be simply
marvelous to entrench the
Pens in an opening round
battle with playoff nemesis,
the Washington Capitals?

With a diverse field which
included clubs like the
Laurel Creek Track Club
and universities spanning
the local area, the Pitt track
and field team dominated
the competition at last
Saturday’s 1996 Pitt
Invitational at Pitt Stadium.

Despite Pitt’s success in
winning 18 events, the
weather conditions in
Pittsburgh on Saturday
refused to let any athlete
turn in normal perfor-
mances. .

In case you fell in a cave,
Pittsburgh experienced

sleet, rain and temperatures_

around 30 degrees.

“You could say that the
weather won in terms of the
results,” assistant coach
Dave Sobal said. “We came
in second.”

With no team scoring in
the meet, the Pitt
Invitational gives track ath-
letes the opportunity to race
against others in preparation

_for the IC4A (men)/ECAC

(women) Championships
coming up this weekend at
George Mason University,
in Fairfax, Virginia.

“It’s a meet that you have
to qualify for,” Sobal said.
“We have a lot of people
going, so Pittshould be rep-
resented well.”

Back at the Pitt
Invitational, senior All-
American Najuma Fletcher
won the long jump in her
final Pittsburgh collegiate
appearance. Junior Angie

Martin outdistanced the
field in the 800m with a
time of 2:11.00, winning by
more than four seconds. The
Lady Panthers took the top
four spots in that event.

Other women’s winners
include: Megan Ferrara in
the heptathlon (4,430
points); Ayne Allen in the
400m intermediate hurdles
(1201.91); Shameka
Osborne with a 1l.37m
heave in the shot put and a
33.48m in the discus; and
Gennifer Washington in the
triple jump 38-feet—9.

The women’s 4x100m
(47.66) and 4x400m
(3:58.8) relay teams also
garnered first place honors.

On the men’s side, a pair
of Panthers went home dou-
ble winners. Junior Orrel

‘Green won both the 110m

hurdles (14.85). and the
400m intermediate hurdles
(54.35). Ron Losiewicz
took first in the shot put
(13.29m) as well as the dis-
cus (42.18m).

Sprinter Jay Jones contin-
ued his recent dominance in
the 100m dash, winning
with a time of 10.96 sec.
Freshman Tim Tyre won the
400m with a time of 49.47
sec.

The Pitt men took the top
four spots in the 400m
despite using several dis-
tance runners.

“Because it was a low—key
meet,” Sobal said, “we
mixed up some people in
different events. We thought
the distance runners could
use some speed work, so we
ran them in the 400.”

Pitt hurdler Orrel Green warmed up for the IC4A’s by
winning both the 110 meter and 400 meter intermediate
hurdle at Saturday’s Pitt Invitational. Pitt won 18 events.

Junior Ed Adamson

placed first in the l500m

clocking in at 4:08.29. Rick
Walsh won_the 800m with a
time of 1:57.75. To round
out Pitt’s winners, the
men’s 4x400 relay team
won with a time of 3222.2.
Against watered-down
competition and a watery

track, Pitt’s ‘times were not
impressive. _ . 

“There were very few
times that anybody did very
much,” Sobal said. “A lot of
that can be directed at the
horrible'weather.”

This weekend’s weather
forcasts predict nothing but
sunshine.

Crew competes at prestigious Dad Vail

Men’s varsity  
lightweight 8
places sixth

Lightning, fires, overturned trail-
ers and popped oars all complicated
the Dad Vail Regatta last weekend as
103 schools competed for a national
rowing title. ‘

Temple University won the race.
The men’s varsity lightweight 8 pro-
duced Pitt’s best finish and was the
only Panther crew to qualify for the
finals. They came in sixth.

A fire had destroyed the
University of Tennessee-
Chattanooga’s racing shells. They
had to race in borrowed boats. After
its boat trailer jackknifed, George
Tech had to stop at the emergency

room. Marquette University’s crew
raced without a coach, as they had all
year

It was all in the spirit of the race,
named for University of Wisconsin
crew coach, Emerson “Dad” Vail.
Vail started the Regatta 58 years ago
to serve as a national championship
for club teams which don’t receive
the same sponsorship and scholar-
ships as other official collegiate
teams.

Bad weather delayed the 8’s final
races, the Regatta’s premier event,
until Sunday morning. Chief referee
Chris Blackwell went out on the
choppy Schuykill river on a rowboat
and pulled the crews off the river.

“The race was supposed to be at
5:15,” said crew member, sophomore
Eric McDonald. Thousands of specta-
tors were ready to watch. McDonald
was ready to race.

“We trained in bad conditions in

Pittsburgh, but we didn’t have that '

option,” said McDonald.

Regatta official Harry Stinger
rescheduled the race for 8:30 the next
morning. He said the race could not
be rescheduled for later on Sunday
“These teams are operating on a
shoestring,” said Stinger. “They real-
ly can’t afford to change their plans.”

“[Sunday] was a lot colder. The
temperature had dropped,” said
McDonald. “It was windy, and the
water conditions were bad.”

The Panther crew had a quick start
and kept within a boat’s length of the
other crews throughout the first 1000
meters of the race.

“In the last 750 meters, the boats
that finished one, two, three pushed
their way out of the pack,” said

McDonald. “Then the last 20 strokes.

of the race our boat fell apart.” '

McDonald and sophomore Chris
Holwick were the only crew members
to return to the Panthers from last
year’s sixth place boat.

It was the semi—final heat that pro-
vided the highlight for McDonald.
The boat had to finish third to qualify
for the finals. The race was against
five other crews.

“We came in third and had good
sprint,” said McDonald. “It was the
best of the year. We’ve been working
on it for the last two weeks so we
went into it with a new energy.”

“Coming into the last 200 meters
we were in 4th place, and the closest
boat had open water on us,” said
McDonald, referring to the fact that

the other boat was more than a boat’s,

“The coxswains started going, ‘we’re walking on ‘em’,”
said McDonald. “We walked straight through La Salle in the
final 200 meters in the race.”

Next year, all but one of the lightweight 8 crew will return
to row together and McDonald hopes again to improve.

“We looked at that race as a good spot to gage how we
will train for next year,” said McDonald. “No one thought
we would make the finals. Everyone was new. We were
seven seconds off the first place boat, so it was better than
last year.”

Two other Panther crews advanced to the semifinal races
on Saturday. '

The novice women’s crew advanced to the semifinals but
experienced a problem with their rigger (the part of the boat
that holds the oar in place).

“The stroke seat oar popped out of the rigger,” said senior
Michael Rhody. “So they finished sixth.”

The women’s heavyweight 4 also qualified for the semifi-'
nals, but they finished fifth -— two places short of qualify-
mg. -

All the crews recovered from the weekend’s travails.
Georgia Tech recovered from its accident to beat Pitt and
finish second in the men’s lightweight 8 and novice light-
weight 8, third in the women’s novice 8, and third in the
women’s lightweight 4. The borrowed boats paid off for
Chattanooga. They finished fifth in the Men’s Pair with a
Coxswain and sixth in the solo pair.

say, attempting to talk over
Grinch. “Finally, we can put
to rest those dogs who have
haunted us. Let’s crush
those Caps.”
After another scare (and

~ another 0-2 deﬁcit), the Pens

did_crush those Caps in one
of the most physical series
ever seen. One of the more
thrilling moments came
when Bryan Trottier tl1reat-
ened to mop up the ﬂoor
with Jim Schoenfeld’s per-
fect David-Caruso hair.

“Whew!” your friends
exclaim. “That Petr N edved
sure can score them goals,
but I heard he has some
problems with female fans.
Hey, barkeep, a round of
quarterdrafts !”

With that tension over, the
Pens could now concentrate
on their archenemy, the New
York Rangers. Earlier in the
season, the Rangers were
considered the top team in
the Eastern Conference.

Well, Mario Lemieux and
J aromir J agr had different
things on their minds. The
greatest duo in the history of
hockey demoralized the
Rangers’ supposedly
staunch defense, scoring 15
of the Pens 21 series goals.
The series was a laugher; the
Pens won four games to one.

“We told you so,” your
friends continue. “The Pens
own the Rangers in the play-

offs. This is getting too

easy.”

Too easy is right. Tonight,
the upstart Florida Panthers
have the chance to eliminate
the “awesome” Philadelphia
Flyers down in Miami.
What a brilliant piece of
work someone is doing
upstairs in Hockey Heaven.

Even if the Flyers manage to -

win the series, which they
won’t, they’ll be physically
exhausted.

Let’s look at the other con-
ference — you know, the
one that hasn’t won a Cup
since the Calgary Flames in
1932, or something like that.
Over there, the talk has been
all about those deadly
Detroit Red Wings.

But in case some of you
have been too busy tracking
down the Deadapalooza
dates (just talk to me),
Wayne Gretzky and the St.
Louis Blues have won three
straight and taken a 3-2
series lead. Like Florida,
Mike Keenan’s guys can
also clinch tonight at home.

This is too good to be true.
I’d like to think that Badger
Bob is up there creating this
scenario, but he’d rather see
the Pens win the Cup by
beating the good teams.

That doesn’t look like it’s
going to happen, but the
Pens will be smiling like a
butcher’s dog in the month
of June.

Mike Kovak is the sports
editor for The Pitt News and
wants all those stupid Flyers
fans to finally shut up.

 Twister

 ‘Entertainment  

V The Pitt News
Wednesday, May 15, 1996

: Typical Hollywood clreck and effects

Twister
Directed by Jan DePont
With Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton

Twister is total Hollywood. To a
tee. No-holds-barred cheese, with a
weak story line masking its real show
of killer FX. The sound in Twister is a
serious plus for any fan of any kind of
serious noise. Death metal types
should go just to witness the utter
destruction. —

The story line in Twister is pretty
dry, as you basically see a host of
Generation X stereotypes chasing
around tomados. The reason these Xer
sons—of—bitches are chasing these tor-
nados is because they have this inven-
tion that will save lives all over the

The bigger the screen you see this
picture on, the better it should be.
Michael Crichton wrote it, and
Spielberg produced it, so on the meter
of mediocrity it should make a lot of
money (because in America we like
bullshit and kisses, and Crichton and
Spielberg have machines that make
those sorts of things). ‘

All together, this ﬂick sucks. Word T

on the street says some computer guys
were fooling around with some
images, and some Hollywood types
got a look and hurried up and spit out
this movie. No real story — just a cap-
italist vehicle for some fantastic com-
puter FX.

Twister is running everywhere.

“Dorothy”.

Attention: If you’re starved
for musical entertainment but
on a tight budget, read on.
Five bands for six bucks.
That’s right, five real life rock
and roll bands for one easy
and remarkably cheap install-
ment of $6! Whew. Cynics
take note, even if you hate
one band, it’ll only cost you a
$1.20, so no complaining.

The only fear one could have '

is that the whole show would
be comprised of lousy’ bands,
none of which are worth a
lousy dollar. Rest assured,
this is not the case. There’s a
little something for everyone,
that is if you like psychedelic
or pop music.

Basically, the five groups
can be loosely divided into
basic pop or psychedelic cate-
gories. Here’s the skinny on
the pop: The Secret Stars are
more than comfortable play-
ing their brand of strummy
rock with the likes of
Tsunami and The Make*Up,
which is not bad company to
keep. The duo from Boston
play basic no-frills music
prone to make you smile and
maybe even tap your foot.
They’ve released some
tapes/cds on the lo-fi
Shrimper label as well as an
acclaimed 7” on Simple
Machines, “Wait/Riot Kill.”
If you like pop music with
sweet boy vocals and strong
girl vocals and plenty of gui-
tar twang, check them out.

Pop'Narcotic recording
artists Sugar Plant have also
been making headlines. The
group has played shows with
Lois, Scrawl and the
Magnetic Fields. Their sound

forever gets compared to.

Galaxie 500, and the group
admits a strong Versus inﬂu-
ence. They mix these ele-
ments with shimmering
results and without sounding
like a bad cover band. This
Japanese group is dream pop
at its finest — hypnotic and
sweet with a little edge, cer-
tainly not run-of-the-mill.
New Zealand’s Brother

Philadelphia's Bardo Pond play Luciano’s tonight!

Love bridges the gap.
They’re spacy, but also have
pop sensibilities. The group
has released some stuff on
Flying Nun, but alas, I know
no more. They put out a very
limited 1p and I wasn’t one of
300 to check it out. Mystery
bands are always exciting;
perhaps they’ll be really cool.
Nonetheless, they have that
New Zealand charm attached
to them, so...

Tono Bungay are from
New York City and are cer-
tainly spacy, psychedelic and
instrumental. That is, they
usually have no vocals. Bob
Bannister, their chief guitar
strangler, is a man on the
scene who’s played with
Vineland, Cat Power, etc. The
music is improv at times and
very textural. If you’re prone
to hallucinations, watch out;
the dynamic’ shifts and multi-
ple textures are bound to
cause you to see trails. The
group is the typical 'l\vist,ed
Village outﬁt (they’ve put out
stuff on the label) and has

-also found home on New

World of Sound.

Topping off the indie rock
blowout is Bardo Pond, the
group that proves there’s
more to Philly than cheeses-
teaks. Rock ‘n’ Roll power-
house Matador Records
thinks so and released their
last lp, Amanito.. Basically,
the group puts out fuzzed-out
psyche epics. The guitarists
have enough effects pedals to
supply an army of six-
stringers; occasional flutes
and slide guitar passages ﬂoat
through the sludge. The band
makes dense songs which
beautifully contrast the airy

a female vocals. In the last

issue of Sonic Death,

T Thurston Moore praised the

group — make up your own
mind. See them live. ‘
Don’t miss this concert. It’s
cheap...it’s rock’n’roll...it’s ‘an
all-ages Luciano’s affair.
Things kick off at 8pm, so
don’t be late. -

Audrey Hepburn is Neck
written by Alan Brown
published by Pocket book

Author Alan Brown’s ﬂeshy
satire is about a Japanese mantra
artist, Toshi, who is surviving the
changing society that has been
brought on by the Americans. Set
in present day Japan, the theme
unearths the inﬂuence of Western
values after World War II reforms.
Eastern traditions and lifestyles
changed drastically when Western
commercialism took over society.

Toshi is living in Tokyo when
the Japanese are revolting against
the sale of American rice and the
emperor is dating United States
movie star Brooke Shields. Mantra
Cartoons, known as Jap-
Animation, is the popular medium
appearing in every form of modern

' media and expressing the clashing

attitudes of the politically drawn
atmosphere. Wide-eyed, big-
breasted women ﬁghting society’s
evils are the favorite characters of
Jap-Animators who feel manipu-
lated by the Western world

9

After seeing an American ﬁlm
starring Audrey Hepburn, Toshi

develops an obsession with foreign .

women whose physiques resemble
Hepbum’s. The narrative uses
Toshi’s body image to interpret the
self-consciousness that the
Japanese feel working within a
diverse economy previously domi-
nated by natives. Toshi is continu-
ously aware of his petite features,
which contrast the long frame of
the Caucasions. This is an innova-
tive analysis to the cultural identity
question throughout the storyline,
but it gains no literary ground with-

in the plot

The story ﬂashes back to
unveil the factors in Toshi’s past
that can be linked to his Western
relations as an adult Hidden family
secrets evolve, giving the book
melodramatic features. Although
Brown’s use of updated current
issues in modem Japanese culture
gives this ﬁctitious story credibility
and integrity. By doing this, the
author has created a wholesome
explanation for Eastern cultural

_ struggles
