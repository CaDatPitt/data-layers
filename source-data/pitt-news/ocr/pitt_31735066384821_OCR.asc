Carlow To
Continue Pitt

 Housing For

Fall Term

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

The University will enter into a
limited housing agreement with
Carlow College for the 1978-79
school year to ease Pitt’s housing
crunch, according to housing
director Don Hughes.

I Carlow, located approximately a
quarter of a mile down Fifth Avenue
from the University’s Towers

3 "dormitories, has absorbed Pitt’s

overﬂow of female students for
several years.

Hughes termed the response to a I

recent housing office survey of 230
female upperclassmen closed out of
the University residence halls as

“great.” The opinions of some 30 ,

percent of the students who returned
the surveys proved 25 to 28 percent
were against relocation in the
Carlow dorms. Response to the
survey, which had been distributed
to students in March, does not
commit the students to living at
Carlow, Hughes stressed, and
return

eadline has passed, students may
continue to submit them.

Offers for living at Carlow will also

‘ be made to University transfer

students.

Pitt students who choose to reside
in the Carlow dorms must follow that
school’s rules and regulations,
which differ significantly from Pitt’s

’ policy on guests in the resident halls.

Meanwhile renovations continue
on the two newest Pitt dorms-—
Bruce Hall and the Forbes Pavillion.

“We have no problems at the
moment,” Hughes said. “The
Pavillion is coming along more

'  I1 than Bruce, but there is only

     

ti  s much to do there.”

Although Hughes said the new

residence halls are expected to open
on schedule this fall, he added that

temporary housing may have to be I

provided to students assigned to
uncompleted floors in Bruce Hall at
the start of the term. —

Duke does not like to be too

predictable, a point he emphasizes 
in his choice of music and ,_
musicians——or, rather, in his
non-choice of music. Because, in  _
this opinion, it's unnecessary to 

pinpoint a type of music.

to play for himself, to make himself

Senate Council Debates
Athletic Facility Use

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH
Pitt News Staffwriter
The University Senate Council
yesterday tabled until its September
meeting. a proposal by Professor

Nathan Hershey that would have"

restricted use of Pitt’s athletic
facilities to members of the
University community after Sep-
tember.

Hershey’s resolution requested
that the chancellor instruct the
Director of Athletics to make no
commitments for Pitt athletic
facilities except for Pitt students,
faculty or staff using the facilities for
varsity and club team activities,
intramural programs, physical
education classes or leisure and
recreational activity.

The proposal came in response to
a report submitted to the Senate
Athletic Committee by the Sub-
committee on lntramurals and
Recreation, which criticizes the lack
of emphasis on intramurals and
recreational sports at Pitt. Her-

shey’s plan would freeze use of
Pitt’s athletic facilities by outside
groups until the council could
review and debate the Athletic
Committee’s report on the ﬁndings
of the Intramural and Recreation
Subcommittee.

Robert Hickey, assistant vice-
chancellor for the Health Related
Professions, objected to the resolu-
tion because it would hurt the poor
neighbors of the university near
Trees Hall, who are permitted to use
the facilities there.

“It seems to me that it would be
revisionist to welsh at this time on
the arrangements many of us fought
so hard for in the 1960’s,” Hickey
said.

Hershey defended’ his motion,
stating that use of athletic facilities
was often‘ planned without consider-
ing the needs of the regular
members of the University com-
munity.

'|ntiltrated' Groups
Cite FBI,CIA Crimes

By The Associated Press

WASHlNGTON——Three organi-
zations under surveillance or inﬁl-
tration by the CIA and FBI during
the 19605 and early 1970s said
yesterday that congressional
proposals for a new intelligence
agency charter will not prevent

' future abuses.

The American Friends Se_rvice
Committee, the Women Strike for
Peace group and a Chicago
organization fighting the intelli-
gence agencies in a lawsuit testified
before the Senate Intelligence
Committee.

Louis W. Schneider, executive
secretary of the American Friends,
or Quakers, said, in prepared
testimony that his organization had
obtained 10,000 pages of files kept

on the American Friends by various .

government agencies, including the
CIA, FBI, State Department, the IRS
and the armed services.

The files show a pattern of
constant FBI surveillance of the

I Duke Thrills Crowd With Light,Synthesizers

 

oisy Stanley Theater audience Friday night with his

committee, which won a Nobel
Peace Prize in 1947.

In addition, Schneider said, the
CIA opened official mail between

committee employees and persons .

in foreign countries, including the
Soviet Union. The committee
actively opposed the Vietnam War.

W-hile legislation under consid-
eration by the committee seeks to
limit CIA authority,'Schneider said
there is a danger that intelligence
ofﬁcials or future White House

occupants might find ways to justify I

illegal surveillance.

For example, he said, the
proposed CIA charter would allow a
person attempting to influence
policy in foreign countries to be
targeted as a source of information
by the CIA.

Schneider said many American
Friends Service Committee workers
in countries like South Africa would
fit that description and thus could be
targeted.

GOOD,” he said. “I think people
need to feel good. It’s more

important to me...it’s a challenge. ”‘

Multi-stylistic would be the term
to dessribe George Duke’s music.
Playing with such notables as
Jean-Luc Ponty, he learned to play
an electric piano—now one of his
most prized I instruments. After
Ponty, Duke put in time with Frank
Zappa and the Mothers of
Invention. It was Zappa who
persuaded him to sing and play
synthesizers. Reluctant to learn at
first, he now prefers to use the
synthesizer instead of his voice to
get his feelings across.

“I've spent more time with the
instrument,” he said, “I can make
it sing, cry, or laugh for me.”

He now plays four synthesizers in

an average concert, including a
specially-constructed keyboard (a
Moog) that he wears around his
neck. But, he attributes his greatest
amount of growth to the two years
played in western singer Cannon-
ball Adderly’s band.

“That’s where I really grew up
musically, mentally, and emotion-
ally.” he decided. “Zappa opened
me up to possibilities I probably
never would have ‘gotten into. But
Cannonball secured me with the
other artists.”

Now Duke's talking very enthu-
siastically about the potential of
electronics “as long as you don ’t get
involved in turning knobs to the
point of disrupting the flow of the
music. I hope they see how many
beautiful things can be done if the
accoustic and the electric blend
together.”

The members of the band are no
less reputable. Gwen Evans, along
with Josie James provided some
very 1 fine background vocals.
Napoleon Murphy Brook, a former
lead singer with Frank Zappa at the
same time George was with the
band, is also on vocals, lending a
fantastic voice and dynamite
harmonization to the group. His
dancing, moving and all-around
stage show kept the audience

the “stick that's "gonna make you

audience with loud screams.

What is the Funk? According to
Duke, Funk makes you feel good.
It’s soul, it’s rock, it's an art, a
music that does not need to be
explained or justified. It’s {very
sensuous, very with it, and very
versitile.

“You don’t let. it go,” Duke
explained. “You embrace it, hold
on to it, put it in your heart...Funk
doesn’t mean anything unless you
have participation.”

And to this end, Duke succeeded.

asked. “To be able to walk on the
stage and get the feeling from the
audience that I can do anything I
want. I like Pittsburgh because I
feel like I can."

And from what Pittsburgh had to
say, it liked George Duke.

“But I'm always going

to,

change,” Duke warned. “I’m never "-

going to stay the same. The one
thing about life, the one thing about
life'——somewhere along the line,
somebody’s got to realize—the one
thing about life is change. The only
constant thing about life is change.
You’re going to change, one way or
the other. I want the freedom to
change, to do what I want, not what
someone else expects of me.”

denied outside groups,’.’ Hershey

said, ‘ ‘but I think more regard has to
be given people in the University
community.’ ’

In other business, the . council
approved a resolution on growth
proposed by the Senate Budget
Policies Committee. This resolution
states that the ratio of instructional
faculty and staff to the total number
of students enrolled at Pitt “should
not be allowed to increase.”

The resolution also proposes that
a monitoring system be established
to insure this ratio is maintained.
Professor Richard H.. Pratt, chair-
man of the _Budget Policies
Committee, explained that the
proposal was initiated by increases
in faculty and staff while student
enrollment has slackened.

“If we are not careful. and keep

adding people,” Pratt said, “disas-
ter may strike.”

After four amendments and many
questions about the effect of the
proposal, the council also accepted
another resolution from the Budget
Policies Committee, which provides
that future appointments in aca-
demic administration should have a
maximum renewable term. '

Under the resolution, renewal for
any academic administration posi-
tion (associate and assistant pro-
vosts, associate or assistant vice
Chancellors for the Health Pro-
fessions, deans, associate and
assistant deans, chairmans of
divisions in the School or Education
and elsewhere, directors of units in
which academic research or teach-
ing is performed and, chairpersons
of academic departments requires
prior evaluation and consultation
with faculty. This resolution applied

only to those with both a faculty
position and an administrative post.

Jack Freeman, who presented the
Chancellor's Report, commented on

Pitt’s budget situation, the Bakke—

case, the Annual Giving Fund drive,

L Chancellor Posvar’s trip to China

Pitt football games.

According to Freeman, Pitt and
the American Broadcasting Com-‘
pany have reached‘ agreement on
televising the Pitt-Notre Dame game

lina State game regionally. He
also said Pitt is awaiting confirma-

Ethel Taylor, who heads the
Strike for Peace troup which urges
international disarmament, said her
FBI files show‘ she personally had
been under surveillance since 1956.

“It is obvious from my FBI files
that agents, women of course, sat on
our small committee meetings as we
planned actions against the Vietnam
War, actions which we gave the
fullest publicity possible," she said.

Ms. Taylor said the organization
also was under surveillance by CIA
agents on grounds that peace
groups. especially during the

Vietnam War, obtained support
from foreign sources, a suspicion
which proved groundless.

She said the CIA should have‘

known there was no foreign money
because “we could afford only
part-time staff, if any, and our
equipment was mostly second-
handf’

Both the service committee and
the disarmament group obtained
information on their surveillance
through the Freedom of Information
Act.

Ms. Taylor said the proposal
before the committee is written in

such general terms that federal
officials inclined toward abuses

could claim that any organization 

was a threat to national security. I

Also testifying was Chicagij

attorney Richard M. Gutman,
representing 18 organizations which
contend they were under surveil-
lance during the 1968 Democratic
National Convention and-later.
Gutman said CIA ﬁles obtained in
lawsuits show the agency kept close
track of all groups protesting at the
convention. He said all CIA covert
operations in the United States and
abroad should be prohibited.

The Week  

Nationals Continue Nix
Over American League, 7-3

By The Associated Pres-

SAN DlEGO—Steve Garvey ripped a game-tying, two-run single
and then tripled and scored the winning run as the National League
came from behind for a 7-3 victory over the Americans in the 49th
All-Star baseball game last night.

It was the seventh consecutive victory for the NL, which has won 15
of the last 16 contests against the Americans and now holds a 30-18-1
edge in this game.

Garvey opened the eighth inning with his triple against reliever
Rich Gossage, a huge drive against the right field fence that missed
being a home run by perhaps five feet.

Then Gossage, working to Dave Concepcion, uncorked his wild
pitch, allowin‘g Garvey to score. Suddenly, the tight game came apart
at the seams for the AL stars, who were battling to overcome an
All-Star jinx that has hounded them for the past two decades.

Concepcion walked and hometown hero Dave Winﬁeld of the San
Diego Padres singled to left where Chicago’s Chet Lemon booted the
ball for an error, putting the NL runners at second and third.

Bob Boone of Philadelphia, playing for the NL All-Stars exactly 20
years after his dad played in one for the AL, followed with a two-run
single and it was 6-3.

Boone advanced to second on an infield out and dashed home with
another run on Dave L'opes’s line single to right. That- was plenty of
cushion sfor relievers Bruce Sutter of Chicago and Phil Niekro of
Atlanta, who retired the Americans in order in the bottom of the ninth
to continue a frustration that has resulted in 20 losses in 22 games
against the NL.

Carter Warns Of Security ‘Leaks’

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON—President Carter summoned key members of
Congress to the White House yesterday to complain that
congressional leaks of classified information are damaging national
security.

Senate Republican Leader Howard Baker of Tennessee said
afterward that Carter told the group that reliable intelligence
sources are drying up because they fear their confidential
information will find its way into news reports.

A White House official, who asked not to be named, said Carter
acknowledged that the administration itself is a source of leaks, and
-he pointedly refrained from suggesting to the legislators how they
should stem their own leaks.

The official also stressed that Carter pledged to continue
supplying classified information to Congress in line with recent
arrangements to oversee U.S. intelligence activities.
_r‘_‘_V}’_§:__havd~a"lp_rig__talk about leaks,” Baker said. “Leaks are an
‘ epidaemiedisease .in.Wasliiii§t6ii§ and I suppose they’ll continue to
be. But if you can’t stop them, at least you ought to slow them down.

“The President cited some examples that did in fact damage the
national interest, primarily in the ﬁeld of a new reluctance of reliable
sources to conﬁde information to U.S. officials."

"72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

The Chosen Few

Anyone who has tried to go to Trees Hall some weekend'after—
noon to play a little basketball knows the lack of concern for
recreational sports at Pitt. If they happen to want to play the same
day as a home football game, they can expect to be sorely disap-
pointed——Trees Hall is locked tight.

During the rest of the year, Pitt students still have an impossible
time finding a place to play a game» of pick-up basketball.
Throughout the year, the Field House is closed for any number of
different special events. The recent report by the Sub-Committee
on Intramurals and Recreation to the University Senate Athletics
Committee cites one glaring exampleof the frustrating schedule of
the Field House. '

During the week of April 9, the basketball floor and track were

, open on only one day. On April 9, the floor and track were closed
-for an outside event. On April 11, they were closed to allow for

preparation for the sports banquet. Both wereiclosed the 12th for
the banquet. On the 13th the floor and track were closed to allow
‘cleaning after the sports banquet. On April 14 and April 15, the
two facilities were closed for a football clinic.

Whilethese frequent closings inhibit use by Pitt students, faculty
and staff, varsity teams have free use of facilities, even during their
off-seasons. The subcommittee report cites the swimming team as
one example. Their swimming season ended in ‘March, but the

/coach still reserved the pool every day from 3:30 pm. to 6 p.m. for

varsity practice and the Pitt Aquatic Club.

The list of injustices continue. The tennis courts disintegrate into
gravel while the Athletic Department spends $1.5 million on Pitt
Stadium for new astro-truf, an expanded press box area, a new
scoreboard and sound system, renovation of the Chancellor’s and
Athletic. Director’s boxes, repainting and expanding football
coaches’ offices.

Such behavior shows unjustifiable bias for intercollegiate
athletes over the majority of students who might participate in
recreational or intramural sports. Such favoritism cannot be
ignored when our rival university,‘Penn State, maintains an In-
tramural Field House with an indoor track, basketball, and
volleyball courts and handball courts. It also has over ninety tennis
courts for all students.

The Sub-Committee on Intramurals and Recreation proposes ten
recommendations toalleviate this prejudice toward athletes. The
administration should act immediately to enact these

’suggest.ions——especially the shift of control of intramuralsand

coordination of athletic facilities to the Physical Education Depart-
ment. This action is the only reasonable one, if Pitt wants to
benefit all students and not a chosen few.

freshman class and their parents to

life at Pitt. Faculty, staff and
students all worked together and
must be congratulated for a job well
done.

To everyone involved with
Freshman Orientation 1978, the
Orientation Staff extends a hearty
congratulations and a sincere thank
you. It’s very difficult to thank each

expanded the ACLU from a
defender ofcivil liberties into one of
the main liberal organizations
which fought for social change. As

PER SPEC TI VE

Lukas relates. this change began in
1964 when the Southern regional
office of the ACLU became
embroiled in the ﬁght for civil
rights, and added equality to the
organizations past concern over
civil liberties.

‘Defense of Dr. Benjamin Spock,
draft evaders and military dissi-
dents further stretched the union's
interests to include topics besides
First Amendment rights. Finally. in
1970 the ACLU went as far as calling
for the “immediate termination " of
the war.

During the Watergate crisis, the
ACl_U continued their spree of
social activism as the first national
group to demand Nixon's impeach-
mcnt. This move certainly paid the
union in the endi it attracted
50.000 new members in 1973 after
the call for impeachment.

Now those days of “burning

are less universally-arousing liberal
concerns like women's rights.

These areas attract less vigorous
support or outright opposition from
some el’emerits of the traditional
liberal community. As airesult,
many who supported the ACLU find
they cannot agree wholeheartedly
with the ACLU’s present actions:
defense of Nazis and opposition to
Bakke. /

This situation returns the union
full-circle to their old position,
before the activism of the 1960's.
when they concerned themselves
mostly with the defense of
traditional civil liberties. Perhaps
that might be the best place for the
ACLU to be.

There is nothing so important to
the American political system as the
maintenance of the right to free
speech. peaceful assembly, free-
dom of the press and right to a fair
trial and due process. The United
States needs an organization like
the ACLU which has the guts to
defend these rights. even when it
means defending Nazis, the Ku
Klux Klan or hardened criminals.
After these _people's’rights are
violated. it is much too easy to

one’s constitutional rights on

The ACLU is probably blessed by
the defection of those who cannot
comprehend the value of the
defense of such people. These past
supporters probably never even
realized the historic tradition which
the ACLU maintains-—the eternal
safeguarding of Americans’ civil
liberties. lfthey did not understand
this tradition, they obviously should
not have been members. ‘

The thinning of ACLU ranks
might benefit the organization '
the long run, but it also puts the
union in a precarious financial
position. During the 19605, a
burdgeoning membership made
fuiidraising simple. When member-
ship declined. ACLU leadership had
to push hard to get the money
needed to continue its work.

ACLU leaders have found new
sources of income from foundations
and special appeals, and it is
doubtful the union is about to
collapse. Hopefully, this ‘roller-

tion can teach the ACLU a lesson.
and they will stick to their original
purpose of defending civil liberties
without becoming embroiled -in

‘Loopholes Allovv Cheating ByCoa|Operators'

By The Associated Press

HARRISBURG——Mining law
loopholes allowed hard coal opera-
tors to cheat the state on a massive
scale. according to testimony given
yesterday by Dr. Maurice Goddard
before a House committee investi-
gating a giant coal ﬁrm.

According to reports in the
Pottsville Republican, lax enforce-
ment by the Department of
Environmental Resources let the
Great American Coal Co. get away

with failure to restore land
devastated by anthracite stripmin-
ing.

DER officials said it will cost the
state an estimated $11.5 million to
backfill the land. But Goddard, the
agency head, said the blame does
not rest with his department.

,“It is the consequence of a
regulatory framework which has
several loopholes which the wily
and irresponsible can use to their
own advantage,” said Goddard in

GOP Proposal Offers

No Cure For Inflation

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON-—lnflation is
worse than expected and economic
growth is disappointing, but there is
no basis for Republican conten-
tions that a one-third cut in income
tax rates would improve the
situation, the House Budget Com-
mittee was told yesterday.

The GOP proposal for such a tax
cut, spread over three years, has
been adopted by national Repub-
lican leaders as a major campaign
issue.

President Carter and Democratic
leaders in Congress favor a smaller
tax reduction, but there have been
signs that they fear defections
among Democrats who must soon
campaign for re-election against the
GOP proposal.

Meanwhile, Carter’s effort to
bring a tax cut bill to the House floor
without a reduction in the tax on
capital gains, appeared close to
failure. Representative Al Ullman,
Democrat of Oregon, said he
intends to reconvene the House
Ways and Means Committee, which
he heads, to work on taxes next
week. Ullman said a measure
involving some easing of the capital
gains tax will be beforethe panel.

The House Budget Committee,
opening hearings‘ Tuesday as it
prepared to draft spending ceilings
and revenue floors for the year
starting Oct. I, heard assessments
that inﬂation continues to be worse
than expected and that economic
growth is slow. But committee
members were told the country does

not seem slide into

recession.

Alice M. Rivlin, director of the
Congressional Budget Office, and
Representative Richard Bolling,
Democrat of Montana, chairman of
the Joint Economic Committee,
both testified they know of no solid
economic evidence to
Republican claims that a one-third
tax cut would pay for itself by
boosting the economy and federal
revenues.

The sponsors ofthe big tax cut are
Representative Jack F. Kemp,
Republican of New York, and
Senator William V. Roth Jr.,
Republican of Delaware.

Bolling said testimony given his
committee, including that of the
principal academic framer of the
Kemp-Roth proposal, left him
unconvinced that it would “produce
a veritable bonanza of jobs and
increased economic output.”

He said comparisons with the
growth that followed a big tax cut in

likely to

V the 1960s are misleading because

conditions have changed and “the
evidence of history does not support
the argument that taxes have
reduced economic incentive to the
point that growth is inhibited.”

Mrs. Rivlin said evidence avail-
able to the Congressional Budget
Office tends to support the
conventional view that the Kemp-
Roth proposal would greatly
increase the federal deficit and be
highly inflationery, without produc-
ing enough additional revenue to be
self-financing.

HARRlSBURG—The Common-

will not recommend legislative pay

are out of session, commission
Chairman Harry Rossi said yester-

‘A Rossi. whose three-man com-

that no plans exist for a pay increase

“There’s nothing like that being

Rossi. “Our agenda is empty. If it

Under current law, if the
commission recommends a pay
boost that ‘isn't voted on by the
Legislature in 30 days. the boost
automatically goes into effect. ’

Because the Legislature is out of

London Scientists, Mother Create First Test Tube Baby

By The Associated Press

LONDON—A "British woman is
expected to give birth by Caesarean
section in two or three weeks to
what experts believe will be the
world’s first living “test tube
baby,” her gynecologist said
yesterday. X

The woman, identiﬁed only as
Mrs. A., became pregnant by
means of a laboratory technique
after nine childless years of
marriage during which a defect in
her fallopian tubes prevented her

‘ from conceiving.

Two British specialists implanted
an egg from Mrs. A. into her womb
four days after it had been fertilized
in a test tube by her husband’s
sperm. A

Dr. Patrick Steptoe, 65, a
gynecologist, and Dr. Robert
Edwards, 52, a Cambridge Univer-
sity physiologist, have spent more
than a decade trying to bring a test
tube baby to life.

“It must be recognized that in the
weeks ahead an atmosphere of total
calm is vital to the well-being of the

‘mother and her child-to-be,”

Steptoe said in astatement issued
yesterday through the syndication
service of Associated Newspapers

'Ltd., publishers of the Daily Mail

and London‘ Evening News.

“Of course, we also recognize
that, because of the unique nature
of this forthcoming birth, there is
enormous public interest.”

He said he and Edwards advised
the couple to “make a special

. arrangement’ ’ with an international

agency to relieve pressure on them
and also “to secure a ﬁnancial
future for their child.”

The test tube technique aims to
help women who cannot conceive
because of an obstruction in the
fallopian tubes which carry, eggs
from the ovaries to the uterus.

Medical and genetics research
authorities in Britain . say the

international medical community
believes no test tube baby has ever
been born, although there have
been reports of test tube concep-
tions which failed during
pregnancy.

No proof has been offered to
substantiate other claims that three
test tube babies are alive in Europe.
The report is believed groundless,
said David Sanders, a spokesman
for the British government's
Medical Research Council.

Mrs. A. is believed to be 32 years
old and married to a railroad man in
his late 30s. Their identity is being
withheld for ethical reasons.

The woman is now in the M3
maternity ward at Oldham and
District General Infirmary at
Oldham, about 190 miles northwest
of London.

The British newspaper syndicate
chosen by" the couple to tell their
story for a fee issued yesterday’s
statement in which gynecologist

/ .

Steptoe urged the news media not to
put any pressure on his patient as
she awaits the birth.

He said all announcements
concerning the birth would be made
through the news syndicate, which
declined to reveal the amount of
money the couple will receive for
publication rights.

Mrs. A. reportedly will give birth
by Caesarean section in the publicly
funded National Health Service
hospital and is confident that she at
last will have a baby after years of
disappointments.

Various sources provided infor-
mation which indicates that during
their 12 years of research Edwards
and Steptoe found they could
fertilize female eggs with male
sperm in the laboratory—in a “test
tube” which is in fact a
sophisticated and complex piece of
glassware.

reportedly became pregnant, but
the pregnancies did not continue
the full nine-month cycle.

Many questions must remain
unanswered, medical authorities
said, until Steptoe and Edward
publish details of their research in
the medical press.

Sanders said there is no single
authority on the existence of a live
test tube baby. “But the general
feeling among the medical commu-
nity is that there are none,” the
Medical Research Council spokes-
man said.

Steptoe and Edwards have

aroused some controversy by their

experiments, which raised ques-
tions about the possibility of a test
tube breed of man.

Steptoe has responded to critics
by saying: “All I want is to help
mothers whose child-bearing
mechanism is slightly faulty.”

The central ethical committee of
the British Medical Association met
in special session last week to‘
endorse the experiment.

Dr. John Dawson, secretary of
the committee, told reporters:
“Used responsibly, the technique
offers no ethical difficulties for
doctors. If Mr. ‘Steptoe has
succeeded, it will-be a valuable
addition to the treatment of infertile
women.”

Players Differ
On Absent Stars

By The Associated Press
SAN DIEGO—-Defectors from the
All-Star Game drew both support
and criticism yesterday from others

. involved in baseball’s-midsummer

classic.

Out of the 49th game last night
were Thurman Munson, Carl
Yastrzemski, Rick Burleson, Reggie
Jackson, and Johnny Bench. In the
past others have electedto skip the
All Stars and take the three-day rest
afforded most major leaguers at this
time of the year.

Jackson reporteduhe had a fever,
but there was suspicion that he
feared he would play. only a few
innings and then be replaced by
Billy Martin, his New York Yankees
manager, who directed the Ameri-
can League All-Stars.

Munson was named to the squad,
but said his bad knee needed the
rest. Bench has suffered back
problems this season. Burleson hurt
an ankle on Sunday and reportedly
will be lost to his Boston Red Sox for
several games, and Yastrzemski
also has been ailing.

Yaz hit a home run last Saturday
but in that game was a designated
hitter. .

American League President Lee
MacPhail came to Yastrzemski’s
defense, telling newsmen, “He has
played hurt for some time and
thought he needed the time off.

~ He’s played a lot of All-Star games

for us and I can’t fault him.”
Jackson waited until the day

before the game to say he was too ill
to play.

Bench was the overwhelmingi,
choice of voting fans to be the «

National League catcher even
though he has been hurt much of the
1978 season.

Ted Simmons, the St. Louis
catcher who replaces him, said in
answer to a question, “John
certainly
popular and I can’t take anything
away from him. But he has been
hurt, and I think I’ve played well
enough to deserve to start.”

Martin referred to last year to say
pitcher Nolan Ryan of the California
Angels never would be selected by
him for the All-Star squad.

“He dishonored the All-Star
game,” said Martin of Ryan who
wasn’t originally selected in 1977
and then refused to join the club as a

replacement for injured teammate

Frank Tanana. —

“A healthy man should never
refuse,” the ﬁery Yankee skipper
declared.

Los Angeles Dogers’ center
ﬁelder Rick Monday was "suffering
from a shoulder injury when the
fans selected him. Even before he
knew he could play, Monday" said,
“I’ll sit on the bench if Manager
Tommy Lasorda will let me.”

Steve Garvey, the Dodgers’ ﬁrst
baseman who was 1974 Most
Valuable Player, commented:

“Three days off is a limited time
for a professional and can’t compare

with the chance to play in one of-

baseball’s showcases.”

All-S tar Game Should Be Taken From Fans  

0 One of the things proven by last night’s All-Star’

game was that baseball fans, at least the ones that
voted for the starting lineups, know little about the
intricacies that go into being a premier performer of
the art of baseball.

The New York Times conducted a poll of major
league ballplayers to see who they would have liked
to see start last night’s game in San Diego.

The players disagreed with the fans at three
positions in the National League lineup and there
were five discrepencies with the American League
selections. Ted Simmons of the St. Louis Cardinals
would not have had to wait for Johnny Bench to be
injured to earn his starting position, the Dodgers’
Dave Lopez would have replaced Joe Morgan and
Dave Parker got the nod over Los Angeles outfielder
Rick Monday.

The players’ choices on starters in the American
League included Texas Ranger catcher Jim Sund-
berg, Kansas City second baseman Frank White,
Boston shortstop Rick Burlson, Milwaukee out-
fielder Larry Hisle and Red Sox strongman Jim Rice.

The differences between the thinking is drastic
enough for Commissioner Bowie Kuhn to declare
himself infallible again and return the balloting to the
players, ending the annual popularity extravaganza.

Monday, who started in centerfield, was placed
10th in the balloting by his peers.

is very talented and»

Sundberg defeated Fisk, 2 to 1, inpthe players’ poll.

Reggie,Jackson received votes from only two of
the 10 ballots cast by New York Yankee players, and
finished sixth in the overall election, yet was over-
whelmingly voted into the starting lineup by the fans.
Simmons outpolled Bench, 144-23.

‘ts;

The fans were originally given the right to vote for
the All-Stars in 1947, but this right was removed after
the 1957 game. That year, Cincinnati fans voted
seven of the eight positions to Reds causing action by
Commissioner Ford Frick. Frick removed two of the
fans’ choices—Gus Bell and Wally Post—replacing
one of them with a fellow who played in New York
named Willie Mays.

Frick returned the vote to the managers, coaches
and players, but in 1970 baseball went back to the
paying customer in an effort to regain fans.

Many might argue that the game is played for the

fans so they are the ones that should make the
decision, no matter how wrong it may be. The

majority of people that follow baseball do not engage.

in stuffing the ballot box with the names of the

hometown favorites and do not deserve to be 

deprived of a legitimate all-star contest. A close, bit-
terly-contested game is what is best for baseball.

It’s your move, Bowie...

0 If George Blanda, retired Oakland quarterback
and kicker, decided to begin collecting his NFL pen-
sion now, he would receive a monthly check of
$939.60 for the rest of his life. If Blanda waited only
four year until he reached 55 to start collecting, the
check would increase to $1,305 a month; If Blanda is
financially foolish enough to wait until he hits 65, the
checks would jump to $3,419.

0 School spirit is not the only reason‘ that the
NCAA basketball tournament causes so much ex-
citement. The NCAA recently announced that the
members-of the tourney’s final four (Arkansas,
Duke, Notre Dame and Kentucky) each received over
$240,000 plus expenses.

0 George Scott of the Boston Red Sox was
definitive when asked if Yankee Ron Guidry throws
harder than Nolan Ryan. “Nobody throws harder
than Nolan Ryan. Not even God.”

Amen.
