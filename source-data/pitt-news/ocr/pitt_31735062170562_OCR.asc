SAAC Seeks Nominees For

«Stole Education Council

by JOYCE GEMPERLEIN

Members of the Student Affairs
Advisory Council (SAAC) decided
Wednesday to actively seek nom-
inees for a newly-created Stu-
dent Advisory Council working
with State Commissioner of High-
er Education Jerome M. Ziegler.

This action came in response to
a letter .received by Dean of Stu-
dent Affairs Al Moye. According
to the letter, the council would
involve 32 delegates — students
and graduates from.Pen’nsylvania
‘colleges and universities — who

A would be nominated by each.
"school. '

The candidates, Ziegler ‘says,
should be “broadly representa-

feels, would prove less time-con-
suming.

If such measures are imple-
mented, Moye continued, the Uni-
versity should expect to be faced
with the problem of accelerating
and improving orientation of
freshmen. Full status, he, said.
involves more responsibility.

Areas which involve increased
status for the l8-year-old—-lease-
signing, health care — must insti-
tute such orientation programs.

SAAC members also agreed to
support Women’s Housing Board
(WHB) in their attempts to ne-
gotiate with the University Mail
Center. WHB claims past at-
tempts at extending mailroom

station in order that packages

might be mailed and stamps pur- .

chased there.

A meeting with officials of the
mail center will be arranged by
SAAC.

Moye agreed to attempt sched-
uling another Athletic Commit-
tee meeting when SG President
Tom Bailey challenged the valid-
ity of recent decisions made by
that body. Bailey charged that stu-
dent representatives had not been
advised of the first meeting,

. thereby eliminating input.

’ .Ellie Smeal of the National 01‘-

ganization for Women spoke on

. "Political,Power of the Women’s

Movement” to a small audience

'9 V in the Cathedral on Monday.

Smeal, an activitst in the Wom-

A. en’s Movement, spoke informally
' on the Women’s Movement’s po-

litical power. Smeal first identi-

 fied her terms, stating that politi-
 _cal power was “the authoritative
allocations of values in life” or

‘ the

“distribution of
sources?’ E
Smeal stated that the Women’s

OUT‘ I‘€-

 Movement is trying to enter and

be recognized in the political do-

in main for two reasons. The first is
 g to gain acceptance of women in

politics, and the second, to try to

reference to a women politician,
and completely ignored the ac-
tive presence of many important
committee women. -

Smeal pointed out that the Wom-
en’s Movement is political, and
that its ideology is simplistic, but
revolutionary. The Women’s
Movement has first tried to
change and establish laws, instead
of approaching the judiciary
branch first, for there were_ no
laws in existance with provisions
for women.

Some of the laws affected in-

clude the Equal Pay and Civil A

Rights Act. In fact, under the Civ-
il Rights Act, using the defined
classification system, women
were not legal people.

Smeal explained that the equal
rights amendment, ratified by
only 21 of the necessary 38
states, will overcome centuries
of common law, and pronounce
women as legal people.

The speech was concluded with

Board Studies Funding of Students

by BETH BELL

The Remuneration Board, created by the Uni-
versity to study possiblity of allocating funds to pay
students for activities met Nov. 7. -

Dave Tive, Assistant Director of Student Activ-

ities and advisor of Student Publications, said that »

the board originated from a recommendation made
by a disappearing task force last May to pay stu-
dents who are Student Government officers or stu-
dentpublication staff members.

The task force recommended that (1) students
should be paid for extra curricular activities which
service the University and students, and (2) fund-
ing should come from a number of possible places,

including the University, student activities fee, or. '

each individual activity in case the activity-fee is
abolished, or a developmental program to receive
grants. The original committee also recommended

the remuneration board should include members of

_the faculty, administration, and students.

/

Tive noted that this year the only publication

which students are paid is the Pitt News. This year
the scholarships were abolished for the editors and
business managers of the Pitt News, the Owl, and
the Polaris, although the editorial staff and re-
porters through a contract with the Student Gov-
ernment. (Photographers, ‘and ad salesmen are

. paid by commission.)

The board has met twice.this year although no
plans have been designed to allocate funds to parti-
cular student activities, stated Tive.

He also stated that the board was created with
the idea that students who hold “time consuming
jobs of of valuable service to the University can re-
ceive payment because they don’t have time to
work at part-time jobs to support themselves”.

Lectures Scheduled on

Slavic Culture, People

by LOIS ELDER

"The United States isn‘t a melting pot; it‘s more of a goulash with
each nationality adding its own flavor," said Dr. Alexey Kiselev, As-
sistant Professor of Slavic Language and Literature.

At the end of the month, Dr. Kiselev’s Slavic 180 class will sponsor.
four lectures, with each focusing on a major Slavic group in Pittsburgh
—the Czechs, Poles, Russians, and Yugoslavs. The programs, open to
all members of the University, are designed to show what the Slavic
culture, civilization, and people are like.

According to Kiselev, “There is a huge population of Slavs in Pitts-
burgh, and many don’t realize they are Slavs. Many people lose their
way of knowing their heritage. Anyone who is interested in finding out
more about his or her background is welcome to attend any or all of

the lectures.

John Wisniewski, Vice Chairman of the Polish Nationality Class-

room Committee and Education and Research Director of the Pan- 

Slav Alliance, will deliver the Nov. 201e/cture. focusing on the Poles.

The Russians will be featured Nov. 22 in the lecture by the Very
Rev. Dimitry Ermakov, a Russian Orthodox priest. He will discuss the
immigration patterns of Russians to America, giving a social, reli-

gious, and historical background.

‘On Nov. 27, Milan Getting, Chairman of the Czechoslovakian Na-
tionality Classroom Committee, will lecture on the Czech influence in

Pittsburgh.

The speakers for the Nov. 29 lecture on the Yugoslavs have not
.yet been announced. Dr. Kiselev hopes to have a speaker for the Croats
,v\ and another for the Serbs.

The lectures will be held on the above days from 2 to 3:20 p.m. in

room 342, Cathedral of Learning.

Fee Issue Mis eading

by TIM GING

, On November 14 and 15, a referendum will be held to deter-
mine if students desire to pay an activities fee. This, unfortunately,
is a gross misrepresentation of what is really at stake.

The activities fee currently subsidizes one hundred and forty
organizations, four student publications, Homecoming, concerts, mo-
vies and much more. The question must be asked if the activities
fee is'voted. what will happen to these organizations and events?
One wouldassume that without money, all or most of these will
slowly go out of existence or become nonfunctional. The conse-

"  .quences would be indeed severe.

Try to imagine a campus already lacking in communication with-
out its major newspapers and radio station. Try to imagine a campus
with supposedly little to do now without Friday and Saturday night

' - movies. Homecoming or concerts or speakers such as Norman Mailer,

Mort 'Sahl or Christine Jorgenson. It is difficult to imagine a
college without them.

The point is, Pitt wouldn’t be without these things. An adminis-l

trator would be in a sad position trying to explain to the alumni and
prospective students why a University the size of Pitt doesn’t have

' T a newspaper and Homecoming. Trying to sell a University without any

.social ‘activities would tax the abilitiesjof any college recruiter. In
essence, the image of Pitt would be badly tarnished. '

 Obviously, some and possibly a substantial number of organi-

 ljlzations would be maintained by the University if only for public re-

 

lations. This leads back to a student activities fee. It may not be
labeled as so, but it will be present, hidden in the tuition. The referen-

" ,1‘ dum clearly will not eliminate the activities fee if it is voted down.

Its now possible to get down to the real issue, who will con-

 trol the fee. If a Yes vote carries the referendum, students will con-
i tinue to determine how they spend their money. If a N0 vote car-
, "ries, the already expanding Student Affairs staff will divy out the
 ;,"'money. It should also be noted that as a department adds to its staff,
‘ it must, by necessity, spend more money. The result is an increase
I _ in the amount of money needed simply to spend the money available.

The referendum obviously is not what it is billed’ to be. When
you vote next week, the real issue will be whether you want students

 ‘to determine how they spend their activies fee or whether the

 x-Qéremlin lBii1a(g,e Gene mater

your vote to maintain student control and planning within the Uni-
versity. Don’t allow Pitt to regress to the hidden activities-fee of
ten years ago. Vote YES on November 14 and 15.

A (lolumn and 21 Half

Four More Years

by JOHN METCALFE

It is late Wednesday afternoon, and I’ve just
about given up hope the teletype will suddenly
print out a correction. Sixty-two percent of us
have decided that Mr. Nixon should have his lease
at the White House renewed for four more years.
I am appalled, but not surprised.

I don‘t mean to suggest that the election was
inaccurate in expressing the majority's will —*
neither do I suggest that the better man ‘won. Ra-
ther I am appalled at the genuine majority will
in my country.

Very little has changed. The presidency will
go on as it has, hopefully no worse than before,
perhaps even marginally better. The war goes on as

- before, some days hotter than others, but always

large, and deadly, and expensive. School goes on
as before, cautiously. Our honored allies in Greece,
South Vietnam, the Phillipines’ and elsewhere are
in the habit of closing down universites, but not
until the rulers have consolidated their power,
and even then not until the schools make noise.

It is unlikely the war will have ended by i

the time this is printed on Friday. On rainy days
like today it seems unlikely to ever end. It is un-
likely that the Constitution will "be suspended in
the next little while, or that Congress will be dis-
solved, though it now seems that such moves
would not be entirely unacceptable to America as
it is today.

The country was richly informed of evidence
that the President's supporters were willing to vio-
late laws‘ relating to disclosure of funding and
to political espionage" and sabotage. THE PUBLIC
MUST HAVE NOTICED THAT ON Election Day the
war was ticking along nicely, and that heroic’
efforts were being made to supply Gen. Thieu
with war material which could no longer be
shipped in the event of a cease fire. The public
had reason to suspect that the Administration was
inclined to be more sympathetic to corporate en-
titiesthan to individuals.

And five eighths of the people who voted chose
to continue with Mr. Nixon.

Some people knew all this but were not es-

pecially bothered by it. Others simply assumed
that the Democrats were just as corrupt, but

better at_ concealing the fact, perhaps through
long practice. Whatever the reason. a compeling
majority of Americans have sent George Mc-
Govern to his place in history. I believe that his
place is the one formerly occupied by Adlai Steven-
son. He is a compassionate idealist, and, like
Stevenson, he has learned that such men are rarely
given positions of trust in this country. The par-
allel may go farther. Perhaps in 1976 some more
ruthless candidate will appear to put into practice
what is today an unacceptable blend of radicalism
and wishful thinking. Nixon’s Vice-President might
even carry the parallel to its extreme, and do just
what Eisenhower’s V.P. managed in 1960. It may
be a faint hope, but it’s the only one I’ve got
at the moment.

Along with about twenty—nine million other
voting Americans I favored McGov,ern and
rejected Nixon. This is a substantial number of
people, but it is a minority. Until the results were
in some die-hards refused to believe the country
was almost two-thirds in favor of Nixon.lNow it is
abundantly clear.

We are a minority, and a precarious one. Our
beliefs are as clearly and diametrically opposed
to those of the majority as they can be. This may

‘be an advantage. For the first time we know _we

are a minority, and that we are in exile in an Am-
erica headed by Richard Nixon and mostly popu-
lated by people who support (or condone) Mr.
Nixon and his policies.

It makes me feel like a member of an-en-
dangered spec1es._As such I feel it is time for us,
the other three-eights of America, to get busy,

to make our, survival more likely, and eventually '

return this country to a sane course.

We may have the help of Congress, if it
bothers to take back the constitutional powers
it has abdicated. '

If we do nothing, there will be even fewer

‘of us in ‘76, and we might even dwindle away

chopped-and-channeled

altogether and wind up somewhere between the
Constitutional and Communist Parties, well-mean-
ing and spirited but hopeless. In the future we
will be either powerful or pathetic, and, as we
begin our exile, we must choose which it will be.

Four more years. And not a day longer.

Last, we make a fast blast to

  he he... it...

by JOHN CAPITMAN

Wednesday, Nov. 8, and a sleepy
sort of desperation pervades the

‘campus — not that we’re surpris-

ed with yesterday’s results: its
just that we can’t believe, don’t
want to»-believe that this country,
these people are as"predictably
despicable as vesterday showed.

This is all old hate by now—I
guess it isn’t very important—but
as a freshman it seems frighten-
ing to think that at 18 I’ll be out
of school—out in the real world
the next time that the American
people—or the 60 per cent of them
who vote—get another chance at
the Republican administration.

And thus my impressions as a
new voter-—as an American‘exer-
cising that precious (or at least

thats what its supposed to be)

right for the very first time —
seem worth recording if for no
other reasons so’ that I can look
back four years from now and say
—“yea that's right that’s what it

felt like—that’s how much it_

hurt.”

I was a poll watcher in the 22nd
and 23rd districts of the 14th
Ward, Squirrel Hill, predomin-
ately full of middle class donkies,
with a few elephants and fewer

squirrels. The reasonthatl want-'

ed to do ‘it was because of the
surprising experience that-I en-
countered when I registered.

Well when I went to the North-
umberland Fire Station to r'egi,,S-
ter, there was a well-dressed up-

per bourgeois Pittsburgh lady— -

and a well suited glaring Republi-
can, who after taking my form
from me said, “And now for the
oath.” '

“Do you promise to uphold the
administration and the constitu-
tion of the United States and to
never do anything or join any or-
ganization that proposes its over-
throw.” _

This seemed highly irregular
and extremely unconstitutional,.
so I argued with them and finally
they said, “Well these are our or-
ders‘, we’re just doing our job.”
But after some hassling and pro-
ducing a copy of the-election laws
they let'it go. I didn’t_-swear and

. I was registered.

So that’s why _I decided to poll
wa’tch—in case there was any
other bits of’ illegal‘ trivia that
needed to be fought'—and indeed
there Vveren’t. It was all so legal
and jovial and predetermined that
it was dull.

I got to the voting ‘place—the
kindergarten room at the Wight-

- man School, early in the morning

~ watching the progression of faces,

 

and was there off. and on all day,

‘and bodies—all seemingly unat-
tached andgalmost animal like

cast their ballots for the candi-
date of their choice — that grand
choice.

There were lots of events all
day that seemed repetitious — a
young woman, carrying one child
and holding the hand of another.
She wore tailored blue jeans and
a flowered blouse, raincoat and a
crucifix hanging from a golden
string.

She wanted to vote the straight
Republican ticket—how does one
do that, and must I pull other lev-
ers to vote on flood relief. What
is this home‘ rule stuff? I never
heard anything about it? How
should a good Republican vote?

And the elections judge—Ivan
Goldberg — everybody just called
him Ivan, explained ‘the machine,
explained home rule, and didn't
tell her how a Republican votes.
“Make the choice your own -
that’s your right as a American-
vote for whatever you want.”

Yes everything seemed possible
at the voting p1ace——and this feel-
ing of? hope was also recurrent,
like the guy who works at the
commune——who doesn’t usually
vote. He comes in confident and
stands "on the line looking bored

and impatient—“You«vote ’cause

this time it matters and maybe
you can do something.”

And then as he comes out of the
machine the combination of pleas-
ure and boredom seemed faded-
replaced by a desperation and

cynicism, pulling longblond hair .

out’ of his eyes, smiling to his

friend who has to vo_te:'i,n another

district,’ “Well I tried, it won’t
make any difference, but I did
something”, '

This transition, ‘from smug

pleasure at .voting—.doing your bit‘

for American democracy — that
fades into boredom ‘and then
transforms itself into a sadness-

, a reeling that “it wouldn’t make

any difference—” and “what does
it mean anyway——nothing I guess”
was on the faces of all my contem-
poraries and I guess very much
on my own. A

Yet there is something immut-
ablyHAmerican about the whole
process—waiting in line to get
your drink at a reception—somber
because you .haven’t gotten drunk

lyet—and* then after voting the.

sort of depression when you get
the drink and its m'ade from fake
vodka and Hawaiianpunch? -

But not all America wasn’t sing- 'C

in’g—the Republican _ committee-
men sat confidently, “Yea we’ll
loose this district—we‘a1ways do,

but we’ll win and get good and

drunk at the party downtown af-
terwards—yea we’ll win.”

Others, some on. the line, "and
some outside_’_ha_nding ou_t leaf-
lets—like the largemanjin a grey

business suit, who said loudly
and repeatedly to each of his
friends, “Well if I can’t vote for
George Wallace—I got to vote
for somebody else—I know I’ll
write in my own name—what do
you think Edith, what about that.”

And then he waves to a friend
on the line——and you start thinking
about the psychology of the voting
party—one must recognize their
own people—-the good guys, your
neighbors, who’ll vote a straight
ticket. - The campaigning gets
down to a subtle sublimated game
of who can remember whose
name—and the party with the best
memory “gets to pick the candi-
date of their choice.

Later there is the counting 4-
everyone sits around a big table-
with quadruplicate copies of the
“election return form.” First
you check to see that none of the
people who sent in absentee bal-
lots have voted—then these bal-
lots get tabulated by hand—a pro-
cess that takes a good two hours.

Finally two people,-one from
-each party stand with Ivan the
judge and call out the returns
while the four people copy them
onto the return form. The election
is then over for the district—the
Democrats go.to Ivan Itkins to get
drunk and the Republicans go
somewhere else to get even drunk-
er——and some people cry, and
some people laugh, and the rest of

’ us are just bored and cynical. and

tired and-‘know exactly what the
returns will be. ‘ '

The’ best thing that happened all
day was when a couple came in
with five littleboys, their kids
trailing behind, fascinated by the
demonstrator machine. I showed
these future voters how the ma-
chine worked. Then they asked me
who I voted for——I said I would
tell them if they told me who they
would vote for if they could vote.

‘One little boy said, “This ma-
chine is sure a lot of fun. I’d vote

just to play with it—but even if I _

could vote I wouldn’t because its
really‘ stupid to think that one
person’s vote makes any differ-
ence.” ’ 2 "

Letters to the Editor   

Editor, The Pitt News:

By having this letter published,
I am hoping that someone in this
University_ will wake up and help
the poor patrons of Alumni Hall
who have been wallowing in mud
for two years. A new Chemistry
Building is under construction and
along with it we will have -a park-
ing lot. The parking lot was start-
ed in November of 1970 but has
not yet been completed.

Consequently, in order to gain
admittance to the one accessible
entrance to Alumni Hall, one must
wade through mud. Up until last
Winter, we were very patient.
Last February a petition was sent
to Hunt Martin’s office (Director
of Physical Plant) and within a
matter of weeks we had a wood-
en walkway. However, the Uni-
versity took the liberty of storing
some large pipes on it. Several
members of our department have

written memos to Physical Plant -

asking that our parking lot be pav-
ed in order to relieve us of this
mud. In fact, when the Chancellor

made his tour of the University in .

September, he made no comment

concerninglthe mess surrounding '

Alumni Hall!

. I/am sure that if this situation
were surrounding the Cathedral,
immediate action would be taken.
Unfortunately,
who have to suffer are the faculty,
staff, and students of the Chemis-

try Department, not to mention -

visitors to the department.

control the activities through a

McGovern was a strong favorite
in in three precincts adjoining the
University Park campus, rolling
up leads of 1,090 toI526,I527 to 284
and 465 to 300. i

The three precincts have the
highest student density of the 69
voting subdivisions in the county‘.
In Pittsburgh, those wards with
heavy student concentrations
handed McGovern their vote at
about the same pace asxother vot-

ers. In the city’s 14th Ward, Oak-

land area, McGovern won by
about 2,200 votes and inthe 15th
Ward the Democratic nominee
won by about 600. Both areas have
a significant number of Pitt stu-

- dents in residence. 6

However, the figures are com-
patable with the 15,000-vote lead
McGovern held throughout the
city. ' '

The situation was slightly dif-
ferent in Philadelphia where Mc-
Govern won very strongly in the

17th, 24th, and Sixth Wards which ‘

Sm .

 mt

 

surround the University of Penn-
sylvania.

However, these areas also have
large Negro populations, parti-
cularly the 24th Ward which hand-
ed McGovern a 10-to-1 plurality.

In Union County, the voting
trend of Bucknell University stu-
dents could not be easily mapped.
The 2,933 students are distributed
throughout Lewisburg’s less than
10,000 population and the muni-
cipality followed the same line as
the rest of county in giving the
President a 3-to-1 edge.

In Wilkes-Barre students stood
out for a "slightly different rea-
son. Twelve of them, from Wilkes,
Kings, and Miseracordia colleges,
were evicted from the Luzerne
County Courthouse Tuesday for
using public facilities to further
the cause of one candidate. They
were accused of scanning voter
lists in the courthouse and calling
registered voters in a last-min-
ute attempt to win them over to
the McGovern camp.

Speck lO8—locus on TV 

Have you ever been curious
about the rationale behind some
of today’s television" program-

, ming? Or wondered what role

government plays in mass media?
A unique experimental course
here at Pitt offers students a
chance to gain insight into the
mechanisms which are involved
in mass media through a term-
long simulation.

The course is Speech 108 (in-

structor Pete Longini) and its
members take the “roles” of net-

. work an_d advertising executives,

government officials, and people
in related service industries.

Realism increases weekly, as ’

variables are- added. These in-

, elude everything from education-‘
al television to program ratings.

in which the class members con-
stitute the viewing audience.

Course creator Longini wishes
to expand the class size to 100
students next term to permit the
inclusion of more roles and vari-
ables, this increasing realism.
Little is needed as prerequisite——
merely‘a small aptitude for busi-
ness operations.

Child Development

by FRANCINE Rosie:

Paul Brant and Tim Hartman.
co-chairmen of the YMCA’s com-
munity projects, have provided a
wide variety of activities for-the
development of children, but they
need willing workers.

Link is a project which was
started by two former VISTA vol-
unteers at Duquesne University
in 1966 andghanded over to Pitt in
1968. In former years, the organ’-
ization dealt primarily with black
children. Due to lack of black'in-
terest, however, Link has become
mainly a group dealing with white
children.

Cyndi Shimen, coordinator of

, the group, lamented the fact and
said that “we hope to get more
black cooperation in the future.”

Link is concerned with children
eight to 12 years of age. There is
one volunteer to a group of 46

-children. Groups meet for three
hours once a week, spending the
time on field trips, at the mu-
seum, flower shows, baking cook-

activities, and twice a year a vis-

it to Camp Kon-O-Kwee. The pur-
pose of Link is simply to get kids
out of their homes and allow them
to spend some time with their
peer group. It also enables them
to discover what the world is like.

The Day Care project is headed
by Debra Berger. Centers are lo-
cated at St. Joseph’s Church in
Bloomfield, the Louise Day Care
Center in East Liberty, and East
Liberty Mothers. The children are
from the ages of three to five.
and most of the centers are open
from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily.

One to One, a project which
deals with emotionally distrubed
children from the ages of 10 to 14,
is run by Beth Gargan. These chil-
dren are usually referred by a

social agency—such as Western.

Psychiatric ‘Hospital—-and come
from a bad family background.
The leaders involved undergo an
initial training period which is
continued throughout the program.

There are three soccer teams
made up of children from fifth to
eighth grades. Each team is as-
signed two student volunteers
and holds two practices a week.
Games are held weekly and at the
end of the season the winning
team is taken to see a Penguin
hockey game.

A new project which should be
set up in January is Adolescence,

headed by Paul Brant. This pro-,

ject concerns teenagers from the’
ages of 13 to 16 in the Oakland
area. The group hopes to set up a

Teen Center where volunteers will ‘

act as counselors and entertain-
ers, if possible. Special shows
would be set up concerning music
and art, the general idea being to
give the kids somewhere to go.‘

All of these projects need vol-
unteers. The YMCA ‘office is lo-
cated on the fifth floor of Schen-
ley Hall and the extension is 281.
What else have you got to do for
the next four years?

Lights Out: San Francisco begs
a question: Why would anyonebuy
a record with 16 artists, most of
whom you’ve never heard? These
albums are-usually old studio
tapes of third-rate material found
by some hungry opportunist. The
KSAN jock, Vooo, who compiled
this one, seems friendly and well-
intentioned, but his jams. don’t
quite equal his sincerity. ' ’

John Lee Hooker kicks it .off
with one of his patented one-chord
blues hauntings. Not bad. At the
end he puts down his ax, and says,
‘_'That’s it, nothin’ but the best and
later for the garbage.” Which gets
to where the rest of/ Lights Out is.

Tower of Power do a side.and-
a half. I confess to boredom with
them anyway, but these tracks
guarantee I’ll never cop any of
their records. They’re not down-
right trash, but the band fails to
belt out that soulful energy that
gets you out on the floor putting
. down steps. ‘ ' .

The songs are too long for their
capacity to jam, and the rhythms
don’t connect with your hips. Side
A four has 12 minutes of monoton-

ous Lebanese restaurant music

and three of Dan Hicks. and His

Hot Licks. ‘

If you’ve never heard either, -

you might get offthe first time,
but your bread will be better
spent on those 99¢ Leb—folk wax-'
ings, which aren’t bad by the
way, and D. H.’s Where’s the
Money.

Peter Frampton learned from
I Steve Marriott, but Humble Pie
sacrificed budding talent for prov-
en rock_ and roll. Fra'mpton’s
songs on Winds of Change stack
simple,‘ direct lyrics against
Humble Pie-Free based sound. It
works well most of the time.

The quieter tunes complement
his vocals best, though. you know
he’s no stiff-ass when the drums
crash through his introspection
The production demonstrates ' a
feel for strings and horns in the
right places. “Jumpin’ Jack
Flash”'is the only weak tune. It’s

‘Lights Out’:Dc1rk, Dismal

too long and there’s no crossfire
hurricane.

If you’re looking for an album
to keep you cheerfully entertain-
ed during those cold nights of lay-
ing back, Winds of Change (offers
a tasteful relief from the typical
efforts of guitar player-led groups
like Ten Years After. Frampton
might notzing you between the
eardrums, but he’ll penetrate
your melody centers after a few
hearings.

His songwriting needs some
polish. but he’s. still young. He‘
produced the record himself. In
all, it’s a very balanced collec-
tion, more inventive than the
Eagles or America will ever be
Two more years and this chap can
be expected to flower into full ‘
glory.

Author-songwriter Ben Sidran
has delivered I Lead ,a' Life, a

' beautifully personal, very acces-

sible _album. Jazzy with electric
piano, strings, flutes, saxes, and
a soft feel that only Van Morris-
son consistently reaches without
becoming muzak, you need this
one when you’re after reassur-
ance that the restless age isn’t
driving everybody into a mad sex
and drug frenzy. 

On the other hand, if your ‘taste
caters exclusively to hard-charg-
ing rock and you like your‘ head .
twisted, steer clear.

idran’s knack for saying sim--
pl_ what he sees, communicates
like a gem. ~He conducts a weav-
ing, mellow‘ spread of keyboard
and vibes that draws you into, his
flow. No doubt you’ve, heard
smooth music before, but this is
unique.

Often, personal artists _,become
pretentious, hung on themselves
too‘ desperately to come across
to their audience. Not so on I Lead
a Life. We’re‘ led through a slow-
ly building maze of soft freedom
wishes, gentle advice for getting
there, echoing xylophone love
lines, and outside chances for suc-
cess.

to the best new songwriter and
first album of the year. Michael
Murphey published a few hundred
songs before cutting Geronimo’s

* Cadillac, songs any country mu-

sic giant would be proud to do.
Now he’s come into his own as a
performer.

Singing with an acoustic guitar
picked in pretty,- personal style,
he needs no help to whisk you
through mountains and over prai-
ries. When the bass, piano, and
choruses roll in, you could be in
heaven. ‘

Murphey’s Baptist upbringing
and pure Texan lifeline provide

vehicles for his message. Every '

song packs a powerful image. No
hokey cowpoke numbers, tributes
to legendary figures, or. sad,
yearning love poems. Just the real
thing, with all humility, straight-
forwardness, and truth possible.

Half the songs are co-written
with various other people, a
means’ that more songwriters
should adopt. It checks the ten-
dency to drift into esoterica.

We need solid, honest music to
remind us of the dues some folks

have paid inshaping our world,

and our beliefs, not drivel about
personal bummers. '
Like any debut record, Gero-
nimo’s Cadillac, has its faults.
Murphey’s tenderness requires
simplicity in the background: The‘
production -is too uneven for it iiy
spots, and the music .is a trifle un-
wieldy with the words occasion-
ally. '

These flaws are trival in view
of‘the entire set, however. After

three listenings. vou’ll be so im-
pressed that no amount _of nitpick- ‘

ing should phase out.
One of Murphey’s rare talents

lies in combining the earthy with '

    What's GoingDown

There’s this fantastic little mag-
azine Warner Brothers records
publishes, called Circular. It’s“a
weekly. and contains all sorts of
lively, goodies about Warner’s
acts (Reprise, too), a tour sched-
uled for their acts and an in—depth
profile of a different artist every
week. It’s an interesting and in-
formative kind of. publication.

And it’s free. All you have to
do is send your name and address
to Circular, c/o Warner Broth-
ers Records, Burbank, Calif.
91505, and they’ll put you on their
list. About once a month there’s
an extra “Listen to the Music”
section that previews little-known
Warner/Reprise acts. It’s really
neat

Anyroad, in one of their recent

‘issues, they featured /this cat

named Guy Zapoleon, who, using
God only knows how many record
charts, computed the top 1,000
hits from 1958 to the present. It’s
basically an L.A. area chart, bu
still interesting. ’

'\

Top ten tunes were Chubby
Checker’s “The Twist.” Bobby
Darin’s “Mack the‘ Knife,” Fer-
rante and Teicher’s “Exodus,”
Andy William’s “Hawaiian Wed-
ding Song,” Percy Faith’s
“Theme from a Summer Place,”
Johnny Horton’s “Battle of New
Orleans,” Everly Brothers’ “All I
Have to Do Is Dream,” the Bea-
tles’ “I Want to Hold Your Hand,”
the Righteous Brothers" “You’ve

_Lost That Lovin’ Feelin’,” and

Richie Valens’ “Donna.” No. 1,-
000 was Tommy James‘ “Ball of
Fire."

no doubt about her emotions and
thoughts.

Count Almaviva as played by
Alan Hitler, was indeed a hand-
some “amant,” and his acting
skills was displayed in variations
of stance, voice, mannerisms, and
movements, depending upon the
role he played. Particularly note-
worthy was the contrast between
his portrayal of Count Almaviva,
and his portrayal of the deputy
music student.

The insanely jealous guardian,
Bartholo, was by turn pathetic.
comical, and revolting. The role
demanded intense energy, as in
his fits of anger or despair. It

came as somewhat of a surprise.

to learn that the Bartolo of this
production, Jean-Claude Barbier.
is not an old man.

“Ruse,” yes. Ingenious, yes. But

‘ Forthose acquainted with Paris

enunciation was no doubt in defer-

ence to an inexperienced Ameri--

not a native language. ’

However, this.deliberate speech

tain portion of .the audience. For

Creative Experiments

Highlight Art Classes

by JUDY DECKER

Imagine yourself contemplating a canvas, wi-ping a paint brush
on your blue jeans, and starting your first painting. Or, picture yourself

in leotard andtights, performing exercises at the barre, and learning '

‘ to move to music. Think how you would look if those baggy jumpers and
too tight skirts made from a simple pattern were tailored into your own
creation. Try to imagine the great feeling of forming sticky, gooey clay
that is spinning around on a potter’s wheel.

The previous “daydreams” may never enter many students’
heads. And if these thoughts do cross a student’s mind, they soon flee
when the words “credit,” “assignment,” and “grades follow, in as-
sociation.’ V

But students no longer have to block ideas of experimenting with
the creative arts. These opportunities are now available without any
_hassels.

Where are these wonderful, fun-filled, and developing experiences
to be found? They can bediscovered in Pitt’s backyard—at the Carne-
gie Institute- ,

Yes, believe it or not, that old stone building. has something more
dynamic than dinosaur bones and mummies to offer. In the basement of
the Music.Hall, there arernany different studios where classes can

’ meet.

The classes offered by the Institute are 12 weeks long, and meet
once a week for approximately two and one—half hours with morning,
afternoon, and evening sessions available. The offered courses range
from Beginner’s Drawing and Painting to Sewing, Crocheting and Knit-

- ting, to Beginner’s Photography. There are over 20 categories of‘ class-,

es, and 60 classes meet in one week. These courses are offered for

, three terms a year, and are non-credit." There is a small fee for at- I

tendance; I

Did you ever hear of Toleware and Tray Painting? This is one of
the unusualclasses offered by the Institute. How about Hatha Yoga for
relaxing? You can also learn Party Planning and Flower Arranging,
or Interior Decorating. Also, classes are offered specifically for "chil-

 dren. The courses provide a good Saturday activity for your Brothers
or sisters, or your children. A - .

. The part-time’ instructors for these classes are usually profes-
sionals in their fields. Manyarefrom CMU and Pitt.

The classes meet in well equipped studios in the Music Hall base-

’ ment. Theidance studio is filled with mirrors and has a strudy barre.

There is a room completely full of sewing machines, and- a special
room where the clay often flies off the ‘potter’s wheel. '

The courses offered by the Institute are very well established, and
have been in existance since 1940.‘The Institute sponsorsthe classes
through state, county, and city funds. , . .

' Students with interest in the creative arts no longer have to
. “stifle” themselves. Instead. they can go to the Music Hall basement
and have some exciting experiences.

Cats Engag n Naal

by JANICE BUCCIGROSSI
Associate Sports Editor

“I can’t believe that were 5-3 and they’re a 1-8 football team,‘
stated Navy’s head football coach Rick Forzano concerning the status

of his own squad and that of Pitt.

The two teams will take out their frustrations caused by extended
losing streaks tomorrow when the Panthers confront the Navy Midship-
men at 1:30 p.m. at Navy Marine Stadium. Annapolis, Md.

Forzano attributes the disappointing showings of both teams to

their tendencies to make crucial mistakes.

_ “Like us Pitt has been making critical errors but Pitt has also
been improving as they go along,” commented Forzano. “I guess it’s
the same with every other-losing football team—you just keep mak-

ing critical mistakes at the wrong time.”

To this Pitt’s‘ coach Carl DePasqua adds, “We need to have have

the big plays but we just aren’t getting them.”

Although Forzano openly shows his disappointment with his
team’s performance so far this season, he also is quick to point out

his squad’s outstanding qualities as players. ‘

“Our team is one with a lot of character, it's a fine group of young

men,” said the Navy mentor.

An asset on the Midshipmen’s offensive unit is sophomore half-
back Cleveland Cooper. According to Forzano, Cooper is “the best

Navy runner since Joe Bellino.”

This star halfback leads his Midshipmen teammates with 639
yards on 110 carries. Cooper has three more games this season in
which he can top the all—time single season rushing mark at Navy. To

accomplish this he needs only a total of 195 yards.

Also aiding the scoring punch of the Academy squad are the two

quarterbacks, juniors Al Glenny and Fred Stuvek.

Glenny has completed 56 out of 105 passes for a total of 712 yards
and six touchdowns. In Navy’s 42-23 defeat against Notre Dame last
weekend he gained 303 yards on total offense (this made him only the
third gridder in Navy history to collect over 300 yards total offense

in one contest). .

“Al is a little more of a threat at the corner but he can’t throw as
well as Fred,” said Forzano. “It’s really good to be blessed with two

good quarterbacks on the team.’’ .

Defensively, the Navy Midshipmen are not quite so well off as

Forzano would like them to be.

“Our ground game is in high gear but- our defense is in low gear,”
related the Navy coach. “Right now I don’t care about the offense,

we just have to play defense first.”

The Navy defense is small but on the line Glen Nardi, a defensive
tackle, and Jim Garban, inside linebacker, seem to be the best that the
Midshipmen can offer, according to Pitt scout Bob Timmons.

“Defensively, they use a lot of different sets (5-2, 6-4) and they
keep changing looks,” Timmons continued to comment. “Their sec-

ondary plays back deep and they are good against the pass. However,

you can run against them. Their last couple of games they gave up over

300 yards per game on the ground.”
# * alt

While Forzano counts his blessings that he has two good quarter-
backs on his squad, DePasqua may have some difficult with this posi-

tion tomorrow.

In last week’s battle with the West Virginia Mountaineers quarter-
back John Hogan suffered an injury to his shoulder in the first half of

the game and he saw no action during the second half.

His availability for tomorrow’s contest will depend on his recover-

ery over this week.

With or without the services of Hogan, DePasqua and his crew
are looking to defeat Navy by a larger margin than they did last season.

In last year’s contest, Pitt barely snuck pass'the Midshipmen —
the Cats claimed a 36-35 victory over Navy with the winning six yard
TD pass to Les Block coming with only 27 seconds remaining in the

game.

by LYNN HARRIS

This year the Pitt harriers will compete in the
IC4A as individual participants.

The IC’s are for the Eastern championship and
will be held in Van Cortland, N. Y. The top 15 run-
ners and the top six teams will qualify for the NCAA
in Houston, Texas.

The three barriers that will be competing are
Mickey Collins, Bob Steele, and Nic Martin.

“Steele and Martin looked good in workout on
Monday and Tuesday,” commented Coach Don
Mollenhauer.

Collins has not worked out this week due to ten-
donitis in his heel.

“I hope to work out Friday and Saturday and
make the trip on Monday,” said Collins.

“I think I can place in the top 15,” he contin-
ued. .

The course the harriers will be running is a five
mile course in Van Cortland Park.

“It‘s a very difficult course." commented
head coach Jim Banner.

“Narrow and rocky,” he continued.

Approximately 103 schools are members of the
IC4A. At least 250 athletes will be competing

.“It should be a fast race,” said Banner.

Last‘ year the harriers as a— team took eighth
place. Two years ago they took second to Villanova,
sending Jerry Richey to the NCAA.

In individual competition Bob Steele took 52nd
last year. Out of the three harriers going this year
he will be the only one who has been to the IC’s
before.

“They have the potential to do well, but you

have 250 runners you can get caught in the pack." .

commented Banner.

It is disappointing Pitt can’t go as a team. This
is due to the poor health of Bob Schurko and Bob
O’Neil and John Black’s bad knee. All three will
rest up and then prepare for indoor track.

“If we went as a team this year we would be
in the top five,” commented Mollenhauer.

While Collins, Martin, and Steele have improv-
ed consistently throughout the season and ran their
best race of the year at the Big Four, qualifying
in the IC4A does not mean they will automatically
go to the NCAA’s.

The final OK will come from the coaching
staff.

“If they do well enough in the IC’s to warrant
it being worthwhile they will go,” said Banner.

    

they have played so far this season. The Midshipmen were even able to come up with 447 yards total offense

‘Sneak Preview’

Wed. Night at 

by VINCE Di NARDO

The Pitt basketball season
opens rather early this year, but
hungry Cat hoop fans will get a
chance to view and analzye Coach
Buzz Ridl’s forces Wednesday
night at the Pitt Field House.

Ridl has scheduled the first in-
tra—squad game in Pitt history to
both “sneak-preview” hisitalent-
ed squad and to access the four
weeks of practice the squad has
undergone.

Cat rooters will once again fam-
iliarize themselves with All-
American candidate Bill Knight,
who will be looked on to lead the
Panthers to great heights. Mickey
Martin, who has not missed any
practice because of injury as he
did last year, will also be eager
to show he belongs.

Pittsburghers will get the
chance to see Pitt’s all time big-
gest man in action, for the first
time. That would ~ be Lucius
Keese, a junior college transfer
out of Florida.

Keese is 6’10" ‘and weighs
230 pounds,

-Kirk Bruce, from the hustling
freshman squad, will also be out
to earn himself a starting posi-
tion. Jim Bolla, Carl Morris, Ken
Wagoner, and Bill Sulkowski, all
familiar Pitt names, will also be

MICKEY MARTIN
Ready This Time Around

Blll. KNIGHT
All-American Candidate

on hand. The game will pit the
varsity against the junior varsity,
for the most part, and could have
some shuffling of personnel.

The juniorgvarsity was rated
19th in the nation in Street’s.and
Smith’s magazine’s recent pub-
lication. Pitt fans will get their
first chance to gawk ,at the highly
touted freshmen recruits. Keith
Starr, Tom Richards, John Ends-
ley, Mark Disco, and Greg Mc-
Bride are among that select
group. -

To make it easier for the Pitt
student to attend the game, shut-
tle busses will leave from the
Towers at'6:30 that evening. Ad-
mission will be free to students,
while other fans will be charged
$1 at the door. Busses will return
to the Towers one-half hour after
the game is completed.

“I’ve been in coaching long
enough to know we have a lot of
talent," said Ridl. “But, with our
schedule, this could prove to be
an interesting season.”

A full house would be extremely
appreciated by the Cat hoopers

and could pole—vault them into an '

emotional pitch for the season’s
opener.

One thing for sure, a Pitt team
will come out on top.

Javelin Prepares For Aot Roc

by PAUL DeVITO

The champion University road
race team is now quickly and di-
ligently preparing themselves for
the "biggest" race of their short
but impressive two years of rac-
ing.

The Thanksgiving Day race.
held in Atlanta. Ga.. will climax
the 1972 racing year——a year that
was filled with exceedingly large
amounts of success against over-
whelming odds.

Over the past few weeks. the
team has taken the Javelin to
Washington, D. C.. where they
worked upon and tested a new ex-
perimental exhaust system. Along
with this, the team developed fur-
ther the engine that won the cham-
pionship of the East.

Before leaving for Atlanta, the
Javelin will be taken to Philadel-
phia where Mark Donohue will
test the car on a special “Skid-
Pad” which is used for stabilizing
the racing machine.

Along with the developing work.
the race team will be honored this
Saturday for winning the Sports
Car Championship for the North-
eastern United States in the A-Se-
dan Class, a Sports Car Club of
America title, at the William
Penn Hotel.

At the present time, arrange-
ments are beingmade for rides
and accommodations to the race
in Atlanta for the Pitt students.
Any person who is interested in
driving to or going to the race
should fill out the form and send
it to Bob Fryer, University Road
Racing Team Race Shop, 123
Washington Ave., Bridgeville, Pa.
15017. "

  

“P|TT’S“ PRIDE—Headed for the American Road Race of Champions at
Road Atlanta International Raceway Thanksgiving weekend is the Uni-
versity’s Javelin. The Pitt team is the first U.S. college auto racing team.

John Ceukner. V

This Friday afternoon, the riflemen will try to duplicate their'ef-
fort of a week ago as they meet Grove City for a big showdown.

‘Foge’ s....F..  

 

- Piii Profit  

by VINCE Di NARDO
Sports Editor

If‘Serafino “Foge” Fazio was a sane man, he would get out of col-
legiate football and become a salesman. He would be rich in no time
and would never have toworry about things like job security and re-

cruiting football players.

This Spring, after serving three years as an assistant Pitt
football coach, Fazio was named Assistant Athletic. Director in charge
of Recruiting by Pitt Athletic Director Casimir Myslinski.

This was a good move for it gave Foge the opportunity to sell
something—himself. And, after making two trips with him to look at
future Pitt gridders, this writer can't deny him of that ability.

A former Pitt center at the time when Ditka was awing Pitt with
his play, Fazio was a free swinging athlete who earned the name of
“Ironman Fazio,” because he played so much.

Well, he’s not exactly an Ironman now, as he has spread out just
a might. His belly isn’t as firm as it once was, but that’s better for
his job as that gives him a lot more to sell.

Fazio could sell a sun lamp to an Arabian dying of heat ex-
haustion in the Sahara Desert. He is personally responsible for Stan
Ostrowski, Bob Medwid, Reynold Stoner, and many others being on

the Pitt squad today. And, if you think selling Pitt is easier than selling
sun lamps in the desert, think again. 3 T

Regardless, Fazio goes on with his duty, traveling thousands of A

l

miles trying to find the Pitt gridder that could turn things around.

He can spot a good looking female two miles away, but more im-
portant, he seems to have the knack to gawk at a football player, see
something a casual observer would never catch. ,

“I like the way that quarterbackisets up,” he said the other day,

looking at a North Hills team.

“You know. Pitt has always gotten the kid with the guts. The hust--
ler. Now I’m looking for the kid who is super. I want to score on one
play like the rest of the football powers.”

This is where Foge will have to use his discretion. There are thou-
sands of good football players around. But, how many Greg Pruit,
James McAlisters, and Jack Mildrens are there? Fazio doesn’t know
that either-, but he always carries a pen in-his coat pocket, just in case.

As a kid, Fazio grew up in surroundings where you had to fight to

get anything. He did that well. So well in fact that bullies stayed away i

from him and nicknamed him “the crazy Italian from West Virginia.”

Married now, Fazio has settled‘ down some.

I

Serafino had a little trouble pronouncing fudge /when he was a kid
and that led to his present nickname——Foge.

     

SERAFINO FAZIO
Pitt Recruiter

This‘ is the first year that Foge

will be solely responsible for the_

Pitt football recruits. The Cats
are at a critical stage, as far as
needing people are concerned,
and what happens three or four
years -from now will be made pos-
sible by the people he- gets in the
next three months. "I ‘

“If we really want a kid, I tell
him that he is the type of kid we
need to win with in our program,”
he said. “You’ve got to be honest
with today’s kids. They aren’t as
nieve as I used to be.” I

And even though Pitt might be
harder to sell that a Penn State
or a Notre Dame, Fazio is giving
it his best. Which, by the way,
happens to be pretty good.

A Very Unsung

By BART MACK

it's not very likely that one
will hear Dave Blandino's name
boomed over the public address
system at Pitt Stadium more than
once per game. In fact. if one
doesn't listen carefully to the
announcer give the startling line-
up. it might never even be known
that Blandino is in the game.

Starting at one of the offen-
sive tackle slots. Blandino is one
of the"unsung heros' of the game.
He is a part of the seldom men-
tioned offensive line that makes
the plays for the runners. The
offensive potential of any team
depends heavily on‘ those un-
sung heroes and with Pitt cur-
rently with 1-8 record. it might
seem that the offensive line is a
lonely. frustrating place to be.

But Blandino still reflected
confidence in the teams poetn-
tial when he said.

"I think we
_ can knock off any team we play.’

If we can eliminate the mistakes
like fumbles. interceptions and
lately our inability to move the
ball across the goal line when
were inside the other team’s 20.
then we won't have any trouble."

The junior tackle has been a
mainstay at his position for Coach
Carl DePasqua even though he
dit not start the season with a
perfectly clean bill of_health.i
Blandino tore ligaments and car-
tilage at the end of the 1971 sea- _
son that required an operation
over the winter. As a result, he
missed spring drills and -just re-
gained the former strength in
his knee in time for camp.

"Missing spring ball really
hurt," Blandino remarked. "I
wasn’t running at full speed un-
til late in the summer."

To compound the problems.
Blandino also sustained a twist-
ed ankle toward the end of camp
and had to sit out a week. He

'. Pitt‘s freshmen recruits this year are a lot better than their one-
-_two. record would indicate. The team is comprised of many players who
7had over 50 scholarship offers and chose Pitt. One of these is Mike
‘Mehalik. ’ ’

‘ A Mehalik was one of the most sought after recruits in the East. with
, over 100 scholarships to choose from. He chose Pitt.

, “The fact that it’s close to home (Steubenville) Was one factor.”
he said. “but the fact that Pitt is a good school educationally. as well
as the challenging schedule we play also were big factors.“

Mehalik received no special favors for coming to Pitt. Some South-
,-er‘n schools promised him that he would play varsity his freshman
.-year, but Pitt made no such offer. Although he has dressed for varsity
games‘ this year, Mehalik has not seen any action and does not expect
jtp this year.
 .. Next year, however. he hopes to win a starting job, although the
’ competition will be fierce. All of this years running backs will be back,
._along with Cal Branch and Ted Berrien from the Jayvees.

r“Somebody’s going to be injured, somebody’s going to be a re-
erve. and somebody has to play,” he noted, “But I think I can make
t.” -

_ Mehalik echoes the sentiments of many of ,the players and coaches
in theiopinion that the jayvees should-have played more games. “We
ihould have played at least five games,” hebluntly stated. “I feel that
lie inactivity hurts.”

_ As to getting enough practice from working out with the varsity,
Mehalik stated, "You learn more things from being with the varsity,
ut you lose your sharpness, and you don't‘have enough plays. We only
new five or six plays well for our games and this hurt."

1 ' Mehalik cites the closing seconds fumble in the Kent State game as
[n example. .“We ran a quarterback option and just as Don Herold faked
.hand.off to me, he got hit, and neither one of us held onto the ball. It
'__as a stupid play on both of our parts. But we didn’t practice it much
‘ince training camp, and if we had, we, probably wouldn’t have lost the

 Despite the losing record. Mehalik did quite well in the statistic
Jlepartment. He lead the jayvees with 158 yards rushing, with an im-
dpjressive 4.7 yard average, including two touchdowns, tops for the team
J n'b_oth categories. He accomplished this while sitting out parts of each
