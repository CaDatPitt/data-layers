The meeting room of the _Vista
International Hotel downtown was packed
to the doors Thursday as State Attorney
General Ernie Preate officially entered the
Pennsylvania gubernatorial race.

“All my life I have prepared for this job,”
Preate said. “I’m ready for this job. I want to
build a better Pennsylvania.

“As Pennsylvania’s next governor I will

and women who obey the laws, raise the
kids, fight the wars and pull the load in this
nation,” he said.

Preate’s stop in Pittsburgh was his second
in a two-day, nine-city announcement tour.

Preate invited Reagan Democrats,
Republicans who voted for Ross Perot in
1992 and the “disillusioned Pennsylvanians”
who did not vote at all to support the
Preate election bid.

said. ,

“We’re putting together the coalition 
which spells victory for Pennsylvanians
when they elect Ernie Preate for governor."

Preate, 55, said his record as District
Attorney of Lackawanna County and
Attorney General shows he is a fighter for
the people. '

“I have fought for you all my life, and I
want to continue to fight for you," he said.

Saturday, Pitt women set a world record
in the shuttle- hurdle relay, and few seemed
to notice.

“People don’t even know that we have an
active track program,” sophomore Tonya
Mullins said. ~

While the basketball team got embar-

the unheard of.

Pitt was faced with competing in the
Eastern Michigan University Invitational

and Kim Blair.

Even though they were without their top
three they stayed focused on winning.

But they got more than that.

Black Action Society presi-
dent Keith Davis struck back at
The Pitt News on Friday, call-
ing the newspaper’s reports
“cruel and unwarranted attacks
by oppressors [of the BASl”.

“The Pitt News has made a
full commitment to corrupt the

Black Action Society,” Davis
said at the morning press con-
ference.

Davis’ statements were in
response to an article in the
Jan. 26, 1994 issue of The Pitt
News which reported the two
incidents on Jan. 23 and Jan.
25 in which the BAS_would
not allow white newspaper
reporters into their meetings.

In the Jan. 27 The Pitt News,
an editorial charged the BAS
with breaking the university
anti—disc-rimination policy.

Davis also announced that
the BAS will continue to pro-
hibit The Pitt News from cover-
ing BAS events “as long as they
continue to report from a racist
Eurocentric viewpoint.”

Director of Student Activities

Joe Cavalla said Pitt will not
tolerate disobedience of the
anti-discrimination policy.

“No university organization
will be allowed to tell The Pitt
News that they can’t cover a
meeting like that,” Cavalla said.

Davis also said that BAS is
committed to mutual respect

the university community to

By Matt Groff

In light of the feed-
back and research the
Student Government
Board has heard in past
weeks, the 8GB voted
unanimously to reaffirm
their resolution to sup-
port an 58 student activi-
ty fee increase to $40 per
semester.

The vote was taken at
Thursday’s meeting after
SGB President Ross
Pasquale reviewed his
‘communication in the
past week with universi-
ty administrators, gover-
nance groups and stu-
dent groups such as the
Academy of Students of
Pharmacy.

“When we spoke with
lASl’l, they understood
why it had to happen."
Pasquale said. "No one
had any vocal, negative
attitude about it.‘7

Pasquale also said
Telefact conducted a stu-
dent survey on the
increase at the request of
Vice-Chancellor of
Student Affairs William
Harmon on Jan. 26.
Telefact reported 70 per-
cent of people who
called were in favor of
the increase.

“As long as you say
what it’s for and why
and make sure every-
thing is well-known,

Br. Bob tells students how to deal with bullies

Following a column I wrote in
the fall on assertiveness, a stu-
dent wrote saying that the arti-
cle was helpful but asked ifl
had any suggestions for dealing
with parents, bosses or friends
who are too aggressive and try
to get their way through bully-
ing tactics.

Psychologists who have stud-
ied this problem over the years
generally conclude that bullies
are often anxious people.
Whenever they face a problem
involving other people they
have learned that they can
reduce their anxiety and often

get what they want by utilizing

an intimidating style.

The problem is that if you
give in to this kind of behavior
you reinforce it, and if you get
aggressive in return you get
caught in a power struggle that
is not helpful to either party.
Usually the best approach is to

try and understand what is caus-
ing the anxiety, confront the
behavior in a calm and reason-

Coping on
Campus

Gallagher

able way and attempt to negoti-
ate a solution that is beneficial
to both parties.

For instance, a student may
report to a parent that they are
failing a class and may not be
able to pass it. The parent goes
“ballistic” and demands that the
student avoid all social activi-
ties, break off a dating relation-
ship or follow some other

course of action that has little
objective merit.

It’s not hard in this instance to
figure out the source of the anx-
iety. The student can maintain
control in such a situation by
remaining calm in the face of
the onslaught and by not coun-
terattacking or caving in. Words
to the parent that might help
are, “I know that you are angry
at me for not doing better and
perhaps even a little scared for
me, but I’m scared also and
could use your support.” If the
bullying continues, stay cool
and suggest that perhaps it
would be better to talk about
this later when you both have
had more time to think about it.

Strategies for coping with bul-
lying behavior can be modiﬁed
to suit the different tempera-
ments of both parent and stu-
dent, but some approximation
of this approach, consistently

applied, can work wonders not
only with anxiously aggressive
parents, but with aggressive
friends as well.

This advice, of course, doesn’t
cover all aggressive encounters.
Beating a hasty retreat, for
instance, may be the best
course of action if there is phys-
ical danger. When verbally
attacked, however, you can
often keep control of the situa-
tion in two Ways. The first is by
stepping back from the emotion
of the moment to analyze what
is stimulating the anxiety in the
aggressor. The second is by
calmly and reasonably con-
fronting the person in a way
that demonstrates that you are
open to negotiating a solution
to the problem but that you will
not be bullied. This may not
work every time but it’s a plan
that can be effective in many sit-
uations of this kind.

New era
brings
hurdles
to South

Africa

By Marc Miller
For The Pitt News

The challenges South
Africa will face at the
dawn of a new era were
brought to light Saturday
as Pitt panelists explored
the issue at an open
forum.

A panel of three native
Africans discussed the
democratization of South
Africa Saturday as well as
elaborating on the impor-
tance of the election com-
ing up in April in the
nation accustomed to
political strife and dis-
agreement.

Thomas Mathoma, a
student at the Graduate
School of Public and
International Affairs at
Pitt, said he felt South
Africa was at the “onset of
a new era” and “expect—
ing better changes for the
future.”

Mathorne stressed the
importance of the new
constitution which will be
drawn up by the leaders
elected in April. '

sor and former chair of
the Africana Studies
Department at Pitt, added

Campus Women's Organization defends
cboice to run advertisement in The Pitt News

Byjohn B. Moore
Staff Writer

Thursday night’s Campus Women’s
Organization meeting drew several stu-
dents who expressed disappointment in an
advertisement placed in The Pitt News by
the CWO and the Bisexual, Gay and
Lesbian Alliance.

The advertisement mentioned women
being used by the media to sell various
products and referred to theLambda Chi
Alpha fraternity’s rush poster as an exam-
ple.

Wording in the advertisement said that
Lambda Chi Alpha brought sexual harass-

ment onto Pitt’s campus by using scantily-
clothed women in their rush poster.

The closing phrase, “Get Angry! Get
Active!” struck a nerve with Pitt student
Ellie Miller.

“I found the advertisement to be very
threatening,” said Miller. “I don’t feel as a
woman that I need to be angry and that’s
what the ad was saying.”

CWO co-President Shira Hassan said the
advertisement “was meant to approach
some of the attitudes [women] have been
faced with on campus.”

Also in opposition to the advertisement’s
wording was Lori Goldstein. “I agree with
the issue,” said Goldstein. “I don’t believe

in the way it was stated.” _

Referring to a phrase in the advertise-
ment that stated no punishment was hand-
ed down to Lambda Chi Alpha for breaking
a rush code, Miller said the rush posters
had been taken down, that the fraternity
had apologized and editorials had been
written addressing the incident.

Hassan said, “We didn’t want to address
this fraternity, we wanted to address the
women angered by the [rush] poster.”

She said despite the complaints received
at the meeting, all other reactions she has
received have been very positive.

Along with the advertisement, the 30 stu-

“I want you to make me the
people’s governor.”

Preate called for an open pri-
mary, even though some in the
Republican Party want the
Republican State Committee to
officially endorse a candidate
for governor.

“The reason I’m not going to
be their nominee is because I’m
not ‘their boy.’ I’m not intimi-
dated. I can’t be bought. I’m a
fighter for the people. That’s
what makes a difference,” he
said.

choose our nominee at the
polls, one vote at a time.”

“To those who would try to
choose a governor without ask-
ing you, I say this: either join
with us on the people’s team or
get out of the way.”

Preate also asked his support-
ers to help him take back the
Republican Party from “power-
ful special interests, lurking
behind the scenes.”

Preate cited some of
Pennsylvania’s crippling eco-
nomic and social problems,
which he hopes to resolve as
Pennsylvania’s governor.

Preate addressed crime, the
issue which recently replaced
the economy as the nation’s
most pressing problem, with a
call for more prisons and law

enforcement.

“It’s time we stop the endless
violence,” Preate said.

“Criminals are not the victims
of society, but rather, in truth,
society is the victim of crimi-
nals,” he said.

“If we must build more pris-
ons, if we must hire more police

businesses.

As businesses leave the state,
so do approximately 8,000 col-
lege graduates every year,
Preate said.

Preate said the American fam-

According to Preate,

“job-killing corporate taxes to

Preate said the economic plan
he will unveil in the coming
days is “a common sense plan,
and it will work.”

Several of Pitt’s College
Republicans watched Preate’s
announcement in person on
Thursday.

A few, including CR President

President Jeff Paladina, rode the
“Preate Express” bus which met
Preate and his daughters

They also stood on the plat-
form behind Preate as he made
his announcement.

“I’m delighted to see the men
and women of Pitt were here,”
Preate said.

When asked how college stu-
dents and recent college gradu-

ates who are now fleeing the-

state would benefit with Preate
as governor, Preate responded,
“I want to reach out to the
young people who are disillu-
sioned or cynical about govem—
ment.”

“I want to give them a home,”
he said.

“I want them to know that

there’s a government which can I

be their government, that wants
to give them and opportunity to
stay hereand find a job  that
appeals to their noble spirits,”
Preate said.

Lurie said, “Emie Preate has a
history of working with the
University of Pittsburgh College
Republicans. Being here is a
great honor.”

“Already, Ernie has been able
to garner a lot of support from
[College Republicansl,” Lurie
said.

“A Republican is going to be
our next governor, and Ernie
Preate very well may be our
next governor,” he said.

According to Lurie, the CRS
will not officially endorse any
gubernatorial candidates until
after the primary.

Baldwin buyout in best interest

Current Pittsburgh Penguins owner Howard
Baldwin may, as early as today, submit a propos-
al to buy the financially-troubled Pittsburgh
Pirates according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

Despite claims that the team is not for sale,
some owners have expressed a desire to sell the
baseball team off. I

If the team becomes available, the best possible
outcome is that Baldwin and his financial sup-
porters would purchase the team.

The appropriation by Baldwin and his backers
would not only benefit the city of Pittsburgh, but
also the organization, on several fronts.

These benefits would have wide—reachin
effects that make this deal very attractive to aﬁ
those involved, including the people of
Pittsburgh.

First and foremost, it will bring a little more
revenue to the struggling franchise. -

Worth about $14 million less than the major-
league average, the Bucs would benefit from a
man who owns three other organizations
(Baldwin has brought two new franchises, the
Stingers and the Phantoms, which are roller
hockey and soccer, to Pittsburgh in the past
week.)

Not to mention Baldwin is a marketing genius
for Pittsburgh.

After buying the Penguins he came in and
changed the logo, changed the uniform, changed
nearly everything — all in the name of a greater
marketing intake. Not only did people buy the
new emblem, they also bought all the versions
of the old one that they could find.

Baldwin expanded the Penguins into Russia,
purchasing a Russian team as a pseudo—minor
ea‘ ue team for the Penguins.

T is provides a new source of talent for the
team and the league. They will sell new Russian
Penguin paraphernalia -—— with some more
money goin to the Penguins.

The centra ized ownership of one man in one
city makes it much more unlikely that, if times
become tough in the city as far as baseball, the
Pirates will leave town.

H. Wayne Huizenga has bought up nearly the
entire city of Miami. Huizenga owns the Miami
Dolphins, Florida Marlins and Florida Panthers,
as well as the Blockbuster Corporation.

While the new indoor soccer team cannot com-
pare to Huizenga’s Dolphins, Baldwin’s owner-
shi adds_ stability to a very unstable franchise.

T liree Rivers Stadium, home of the Bucs and
Steelers, has, as the Post-Gazette states, “one of
the worst stadium leases in the free world.”

If Baldwin were to come in as the owner, he
would pull a little more clout with the city as he
slowl accumulates stock in Pittsburgh sports and
there ore can exert influence in the city.

With the pull that owning a majority of
Pittsburgh sports would bring, he will be able to
negotiate better deals with all concerned and
improve the financial situation of the team and
the city.

BAS broke policy, should be punished

If a U.S. citizen commits a
crime, regardless of her or his
race, creed, religion, sexual ori-
entation, etc., that person is
indicted and/or charged with
the crime.

If a person willfully divulges
or admits information determin-
ing his or her guilt, there is usu-
ally no question as to whether
or not there will be a trial.

If a member of the Pitt com-
munity violates a policy, the
proper course of action should
be taken against that member
respectively.

Furthering this point, I have a
simple question: If a representa-
tive of a university student
organization violates a policy —
one which all student organiza-
tions must follow to remain an
organization, hold office space
and receive monies from the
student activities fee fund allo-
cated by [the] Student
Government Board - should
that representative and/or orga-
nization be charged with a vio-

“ lation?

Tuesday evening, representa-
tives of the Black Action Society
violated not only the student
certification" code, but also the
university’s anti—discrimination
policy.As a student organiza-
tion, BAS has agreed to certifi-
cation requirements 15 and 21
which state: all university orga-
nizations commit to “adhere to
university regulations,” and to
remain “consistent with the
educational mission of the uni-

Versity.”

According to the organization
certification contract, which all
organizations must sign, “any
violation of the certification
requirements may result in sus-
pension or revocation of certifi-
cation.”

The anti-discrimination policy
is considered to be a university

regulation; therefore, violation‘

of the policy is equal to viola-
tion of those requirements stat-
ed above, and warrants loss or
suspension of BAS’s certifica-
tion. The actual anti-discrimina-
tion policy “prohibits discrimi-
nation  based on race  [and]
applies to activities.”
Violation of university policy
warrants/requires charges to be
filed with the office of judicial
Affairs  a.k.a. J-Board.

Why then have no charges
been filed against those repre-
sentatives of BAS who admitted
denying the admission of Pitt
News reporters to a “general”
meeting on the basis of their
skin color?

The meeting was publicized
(on several signs in the William
Pitt Union) as “general” not
closed; how then could repre-
sentatives deny any Pitt student
or community member access?

A BAS representative stated
that “we might discuss things
that may seem offensive to
white people...” Is this not a
furthering of the violation?

Possibly the greatest and
most disturbing violation was

that of a university official, the
advisor of BAS, who stated “a
black reporter would have a
greater understanding. A white
reporter would report through a
white perspective.”

As an open-minded propo-
nent of this university and its
regulations, is it not the respon-
sibility of this very same official
to give guidance and wisdom to
Pitt students, rather than racist
indignation?

On the whole, the racial cli-
mate here is no—less-than dis-
gusting, yet the university
administrators choose to diffuse

.these tensions rather than attack

them head-on and educate
everyone in the community,
regardless of race creed, reli-
gion, etc.

If in‘ fact BAS believes they
have grounds to file charges
against The Pitt News for viola-
tion of the Publications Code
which requires student organi-
zations to “refrain from expres-
sions that are considered
obscene or libelous according
to current legal definitions,” i.e.
consistent misrepresentation
and misquotation, then BAS
should take the appropriate
course of action.

Resorting to racism and intol-
erance, when BAS members
consistently expect the universi-
ty community to be open-mind-
ed and receptive to their goals
is a little more than hypocritical.

Blade Action Society shooting itself in the foot

The Black Action Society is shooting itself in
the foot. The Pitt News (1/26/94) printed an arti-
cle reporting that their writers were denied per-
mission to cover several BAS meetings because

the reporters were white.

Yet on the same page of that issue, BAS Vice
Chair Michael Barge, attending the Tolerance
On Campus seminar, was quoted saying, “On an
individual level and as a group  it all starts
with us. It comes down to respect. When I treat

you like I like to be treated  ”

So which is it? Is the BAS a group of African
Americans who wish to represent themselves by

regation.

shutting out everyone that is not of the same
race? Fine. Then have the BAS represent only
African Americans, don’t invite any Pitt News
reporters to meetings, and perpetuate racial seg-

But if the BAS wants to fight discrimination
and prejudice, they need to start by removing
racial intolerance from their own group. Until
this conﬂict of interests is resolved, the BAS will
continue to draw bad press, regardless of who

is writing the article.

The response continues over rights of media, student group

For all intents and purposes there is a war going on
between the Black Action Society and ThePitt News.
However if The Pitt News is your only access to the
goings-on in this war, then perhaps you do not know
the entire story. But first I want to make a few things
clear.

1. I am a white_student. I ﬁnd it personally abhorrent
that my race should be in any way important, but oth-
ers believe it is, so I will not make anyone wonder.

2. While I have written Perspective columns before, I
do not consider myself to be connected to or affiliated
with The Pitt News.

3. Neither am I in anyway affiliated with BAS.

Now that that is clear, we can get on with it.
According to the Jan. 26 The Pitt News BAS refused to
allow two white reporters access to a meeting, but
would have allowed a black reporter access. Then the
official Pitt News editorial of Jan. 27 called for universi-
ty officials to take action against BAS for violation of the
university’s non-discrimination policy.

If that is what in actuality happened then such action
would be appropriate. But was this incident properly
reported? BAS Chairman Keith Davis says no. I spoke
with Keith on the night of the 26th and he told me quite

' a different story.

First he said that he informed Julie Sabol, editor in
chief of The Pitt News, a few days before the meeting
that BAS wished no media coverage of their meeting,
which they are legally entitled to under the “Sunshine
Act” (a federal act that applies to all state institutions,
such as a public university) as long as the media is
informed in advance. Keith said that Ms. Sabol initially

THE PI'l'I' NEWS, MONDAY, JANUARY 31, 1994

 

agreed to this, but then changed her mind and told
Keith she would report on it anyway. Therefore when
the two white reporters arrived, they were naturally
denied access.

Now comes the crucial part. Keith told me that yes, a
black reporter would have been allowed to enter the
meeting, as all black students are considered inherently
passive members of BAS, but would not have been able
to report on the proceedings. In other words any black
person could enter the meeting as well as any white
member of BAS (there are three by the way); however
no one, regardless of race, was allowed to cover the
meeting for any media organization.

Keith also told me that Julie Sabol has an intense per-
sonal hatred of him and that other articles on BAS
racism have been taken out of context in similar ways.

So where does the truth lie? What really happened? I,
like most of the people reading this article, was not
there and therefore cannot say with any reasonable
degree of certainty what really happened (not that lack
of sufficient evidence has ever stopped people from
making opinions in the past — just ask Michael
Jackson, Tonya Harding or Bill Clinton).

However knowing Keith (he’s my dormitory ﬂoor’s
resident assistant) I believe what he told me. In fact
considering that this and past articles have made Keith
out to be a radical and somewhat racist individual, I
was seriously wondering, before I discussed the issues
with him, if there were perhaps two Keith Davis’s on
campus. ‘ A

However, on the other side of the issue, I would not
find it surprising if there are individuals within BAS

who would like nothing better than to infuriate white
members of The Pitt News.

Ultimately, though, it comes down to the issue of fair
and equal access. Regardless of the number of jokes
students and faculty make about the quality of The Pitt
News, a front page headline stating BAS racism goes a
long way in influencing the opinions of university
members.

Also it’s not as if it is historically rare for the news
media to make an intentional effort to inﬂuence opin-
ion (examine the causes of the Spanish—American war,
or Nazi propaganda). Of course BAS does its own
“name calling.” In a response to The Pitt News article
which I read in Keith’s room (though I never did see it
anywhere on campus) The Pitt News is once collective-
ly referred to as “a bunch of Eurocentric racists.” And I
do not fondly remember last year’s attempt by BAS to
deny Darryl Gates his right of free speech.

But The Pitt News has a unique and tremendous
inﬂuence on public opinion and, in an issue as contro-
versial and volatile as this one, I feel that BAS should
have as equal a voice as possible, so I tried to, among
other things, express their side in this article.

Hopefully both The Pitt News and BAS will grow up
a little bit and come to some sort of agreement before
their private little war spreads any farther. It may even
be necessary at some point for the university to step in
and investigate. However the introduction of our won-
derful University—of—Pittsburgh ‘bureaucracy may only
make matters worse. I

Having BAS ﬁne, shutting Whites out, separatism can no longer be tolerated

Recently, The Pitt News report-
ed the Black Action Society had
snubbed attempts to cover one
of their meetings. O.K., ﬁne, any
group or organization has the
power to refuse the media, right?
Wrong, the BAS happens to be a
university—sponsored organiza-
tion. University policy states very
clearly that it does not discrimi-
nate based on race, sex, or color.
The solution would seem simple
then; have the university step in
and inform BAS (a),inhibiting
reporters from meetings violates
our policy (b) continuing this
practice will result

in investigations and suspen-
sions.

It is, however, unlikely the
university will do anything. And
that is a shame because BAS and
organizations like it will contin-
ue to subvert rules.

Wait, why should white stu-
dents care what goes on at BAS
anyway? It is for black students

’ only.

As chair Kelby‘ Ritter so elo-
quently states, “The meetings are
now closed because black stu-
dents feel more comfortable and
we might discuss things that
might seem offensive to white

people  Oh, and what things
might those be Mr. Ritter? I
mean, you know university poli-
cy: no discriminating, regardless
of race, color, or sex.

Mr. Ritter apparently feels that
some of us white students might
get a little squeamish at what
actually goes on at those meet-
ings.

Well, here’s a solution that
might suit everyone. I propose
white students petition Pitt to
create a White Action Society. Of
course only whites will be
allowed to attend meetings. And
only white reporters will be

allowed to cover events because,
“We white students feel more
comfortable with only white
reporters and blacks might find
some of our discussions offen-
sive.” The chances of this hap-
pening are slim and none, and
slim just left the building.
Subsequently, the double stan-
dard that now exists at Pitt and
many other college campuses
will continue.

The other upsetting issue that
shows its ugly face here is sepa-
ratism. It has become apparent
that blacks at Pitt are choosing
this route.

The reason is blacks are sick
of white culture. That is under-
standable, whites are still the
majority. But choosing to shut
whites out completely is not the
answer. Having BAS is fine.
However, shutting the door on
whites is not.

What is wrong with having a

‘white perspective on black

issues? Likewise, what is wrong
with having a black perspective
on white issues? Or how about
human perspectives on human
issues?

BAS shouldn't discriminate. . . . . . The Pitt News is Eurocentric

“I have a dream that my four little chil-
dren will one day live in a nation where

they will not be judged by the color of

their skin but by the content of the char-

acter.” Has this message fallen upon deaf

ears? . .
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was truly a
man of conviction, moral courage and

perseverance. He stayed the course. He‘

relentlessly fought the fight. He trudged
through a land sweltering with oppres-
sion and prejudice to attain "a goal — that
the people of this great country would
look beyond skin color and into each
others hearts.Unfortunately, this inspiring
message does not exist on this campus.
There should not be incidents where BAS
holds meetings and will not allow
reporters to enter based on the reasoning
that they are white. Call it reverse discrim-
ination or whatever you desire, but the
fact is, BAS excluded and continues to
exclude individuals based on skin color.
There is no denial that the black man

suffered a terrible plight under slavery.
There is no denial that even after emanci-
pation they were denied basic freedoms
granted to other Americans solely on the
basis of their skin color. BUT, I do deny
that racism should be practiced - by any-
one. Excluding reporters based on skin
color perpetuates the exact form of
racism that African Americans fought
courageously to overcome.

Let the walls between the races come
down at this university even if it takes
one brick at a time. “Let freedom ring
from the heightening Alleghenies of

Permsylvani  and when we let it ring 

we will be able to speed up that day
when all of God’s children, black men
and white men, Jews and gentiles,
Protestants and Catholics, will be able to
join hands and sing in the words of the
old Negro spiritual, ‘Free at last! Free at
last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at
last!”

BAS poorly represents African American students

I can no longer give the Black Action
Society the benefit of the doubt. In the

past, I was able to overlook the bigotry of A

their “leaders”  "because I felt that the
poor judgement of one man speaking on

I. T behalf of 'the.BAS should not -taint the

entire organization. The January 26 issue
of The. Pitt News has convinced me that
the BAS is indeed a pillar of racial intoler-
ance. Never have I seen an ethnic com-
munity so poorly representedby an orga-
nization designed to advance its agenda.
i refuse to believe that the BAS repre-
sents African Americans at our university.

I urge everyone not to allow the BAS to
earn contempt for the important concerns
of the black community, which must.be
addressed quickly, wisely, ‘ and‘ peaceful-

ly. At this, the insolent BAS has been an’

extravagant failure. ,
I am absolutely outraged that my stu-
dent activity fee is being used to promote

racism. I can no longer believe a few bit-g

ter remarks are responsible for this. The
BAS is a seriously-flawed organization
and a menace to us all.‘

Patrick P. Peschnaubowitz

CA5 ‘95

This is in reference to the Jan. 26 and
Jan. 27 issues of The Pitt News which
featured articles concerning the BAS.

As a student here at Pitt for the past
five years, as well as a former staff
writer and columnist for The Pitt News, I
can say with first-hand knowledge that
the Black Action Society certainly has a
point about the Eurocentric filter with
which The Pitt News‘ reporters and edi-
torial board View the actions of African
Americans both here at Pitt and in the
general populace.

Last year in particular, the Perspective
section of The Pitt News was filled with
smug, patronizing columns by white
writers criticizing black people in gen-
eral without any semblance of balance,
i.e. accounting for the ways in which
white racism may contribute to the

- “decline” of the black community.

Also, the debate over letting white
reporters in to cover BAS events is not
the same, as the editorial put it, “as only
white males being allowed to cover
their events,” because the Pitt News as
well as other mainstream media (espe-
cially in Pittsburgh) inherently favors
white people, particularly white males.

-This -argument is invalid because it

assumes that black students at Pitt have
the same opportunity of access and
empathy as white students; to the con-
trary, as far as eliminating Eurocentric
bias in the United States, the playing
field is far from equal.

BAS certainly has a right to protect
themselves from hurtful and erroneous
coverage from this campus’ newspaper.
Black students pay activities fees too,
(which goes towards the space The Pitt
News uses freely from the university),
why shouldn’t they be frustrated at con-
stantly seeing negative images of them-
selves from the newspaper they help
support? .

And despite Julie Sabol’s assertions, it
is in my experience at The Pitt News
that black students are definitely alien-
ated from the editorial process.

However, The Pitt News has the right
to cover events on campus which are
advertised as being open to the public.

It is in my opinion that Julie Sabol as

‘well as the Publications board sit down

with BAS and its advisor and discuss
and resolve this problem -which dogs

the media here and throughout the C

country.

ThePitt women’s basketball
team has pulled out to a 14-3
record, 8-1 in the Big East, with
an offensive goal of 70 points
per game. Lady Panther head
coach Kirk Bruce said that if the
team gets 70, they usually win.

Pitt got close to that mark,
taking a 19-point lead on a
three—point shot by Jenine
Joyce, then the offense just
seemed to disappear. The Lady
Panthers scored only two points
in the next 4:30.

“It was starting to get a little
scary,” Joyce said.

Pitt pulled out of the slump in
time to hold on for a 74-65 win
over the Boston College Eagles
yesterday at Fitzgerald Field
House, but not ‘before things
got interesting.

“It seemed like forever,’.’
Bruce said.

“The game flows if you’re
scoring,” Joyce said.

“When you’re not scoring, the
game slows down. It

drags.” ,

Senior guard Erin Maloy
pulled the Panthers out of that
particular mt with a three—point
shot, her third in the contest.
Pitt drained nine—of-14 three
pointers in the game, with
Maloy, Joyce and Jill Colabrese
hitting three each.

“T hat’s a real nice trifecta out
there for the three,” Bruce said.

Pitt knocked off the Eagles
82-63 earlier this season in
Boston behind 23 points from
Jonna Huemrich and 22 from
Colabrese. This time, Boston
College was able to slow
Huemrich, holding her two 12
points even as she grabbed 11
rebounds.

“A lot of teams try to shut
down Jonna,” Joyce said.

“That opens up the outside a
little more. Today everyone was
shooting well from the
side.” H.
In the first half, Colabrese
burned the Eagles again. She
scored 15 in the half, including
all three of her treys. She led a
Panther squad that hit 56 per.-

out-

‘ cent of its shots from the field in
the opening period, including
seven—of—ten threes, and hit all
five of its free throw attempts.

The Eagles stayed relatively
close with the Big East’s top
scorer, senior guard Kerry
Curran, tossing in 16 points,
including four three-pointers.
They also hit twice as many free
throws as Pitt, making 10-of-13
from the charity stripe.

Boston College kept chipping
away at Pitt enough to go into
the half down only 42-36.

“We were real dismayed that
we shot 56 percent and we
were only up  Bruce said.

Bruce pointed to the Eagle
defense as a key in keeping the
game close.

“We only took 48 shots,”
Bruce said.

“They did a nice job on us
defensively.”

Best in COu7”tZ‘tj/ converge on Field House for All-Star meet

By Dan Lauso
Staﬂ‘ Writer

The best vs. the best, No. 1 vs. No. 2,
the irresistible force meeting the irnmov—
able object. Call it what you will but
tonight at the Fitzgerald Field House the
best that the world of collegiate
wrestling has to offer will be strutting its
stuff in one of the premier wrestling
events of its kind.

The National Wrestling Coaches
Association All-Star Classic pits many of
the top- ranked wrestlers in the country
against one another.

Seven—out-of-the-11 matches will see
the No. 1 seed in the country, at that
given weight class, face off against the
No. 2 seed in the country.

“Some of the finest collegiate wrestlers
in the country will be showcased in the
match, and it is anevent any wrestling
fan should witness,” Pitt Panther
wrestling head coach Rande Stottlemyer
said.

One of the premier wrestlers hitting
the mat will be local wrestling phenom
Cary Kolat. Kolat, a student at Penn
State, is a western-Pennsylvania native
who attended Jefferson & Morgan High

School

Kolat is ranked No. 1 in the country at
the 134 lbs. division and will face-off
against the country’s no. 3 seed — T. J.
Jaworsky of North Carolina State.

American candidate Jeff Kloiber in the
190—lbs. division.

Kloiber, currently ranked eighth in the
country, will square off against Michigan
State’s Emilio Collins, the No. 4 seed in

Over the past five days the Panther
wrestling team split four matches to
raise their season record to 8-5.

Wednesday night Pitt beat the
Vikings of Cleveland State to secure
their second Eastern Wrestling League
conference victory. ‘

As has been their usual foray this
season, the Panthers fell behind early
and pulled the match out in the final
six weight classes.

Pitt’s John Richey recorded a pinfall
over Joe Barabas at 3:40 of the 134
lbs. match.

Over the weekend the Panthers
traveled to Clemson University to

Wrestlers split four matches in five days

compete against the Tigers and
University of North Carolina at
Greensboro.

The Panthers couldn’t solve the rid-
dles that the Tigers threw at them as
they were soundly defeated 25-12.

Winners for the Panthers included
John Richey, Derek Burgert, and the
amazing Rich Catalano. _ ’

The Panthers’ big guns of Jeff
Kloiber and Pat Wiltanger both lost by
narrow margins of 2-1.

Perhaps feeling a little disappointed
in their previous effort, the wrestlers
came out and blew UNC Greensboro

See Wrap-up, page 12

As host school, Pitt is allowed to enter
one of their wrestlers to compete in the
gruelling event.

Pitt’s choice for its entry will be All-

the country at 190 lbs.

Despite the intense pressure facing
him, Kloiber displays a unique calm in
anticipating the upcoming proceedings.

“[The classic] is real important for me,
but I’m not nervous,” Kloiber said.

“I’ve been training for this the entire
year” '

The premier match of the evening
could be at the 158-lbs. division.

Pat Smith, a three-time NCAA champi-
on, is hoping this year to become the
first four-tirne NCAA champion.

In his match, Smith will face the No. 2
seed in the country, Sean Bormet.

“Many people believe that if there is
anyone out there who can beat Smith,
it’s Bormet,” Pitt assistant coach Jim
Beichner said.

Everyone involved in the All-Star
Classic, from the wrestlers to the fans,
benefits from this event.

“For the wrestlers, this is their moment
in the spotlight,” said Beichner — a for-
mer participant in this event. “For the
fans, this is like the NCAA tournament
finals without having to sit through all
the qualifiers’ matches and consolation
matches.”

For the wrestlers, just being involved is
an important feather in their caps.

“This is a really big event in college
wrestling,” Stottlemyer said. “Any kid
who is a competitor wants to be here for

this.”

Men swimmers thrash outmatched Villanova, 162-79

Sean Duncan
Staff’ Writer

Oh, sweet revenge.

The men’s swimming and diving team
(7-1) broke out their brooms against
Villanova this weekend, sweeping the
Wildcats in six out of the 15 events and
won ten, en route to a 162-79 whitewash
at Trees Hall.

Pitt’s legacy of ten straight Big East
titles came to an abrupt halt last year at
the Big East Championships, at the
hands of none other than the visiting
‘Cats.

Revenge was definitely on the minds
of the swim team.

“All I wanted to do was to blow them
out of the water,” said senior diver Sean
Braud. “I wanted to beat them by a hun-
dred points, two hundred points — by
as much as we possibly could.

“That feeling of losing last year, I don’t
want that again, and I don’t foresee it
happening again. We were sending a
message by all means.” ‘

Braud and the rest of the diving team
did all they could to crush Villanova —
they swept both the 1-yard and 3-yard
dives.

Braud won both events.

In the 3-yard dive Steve Wolfe came in
second and John Soulakis in third.
Jeremy McClean placed second in the 1-
yard dive and Steve Wolfe in third.

The swimmers took care of the rest.

Matt Brady won the 200- yard
freestyle, Sami Vartiainen finished sec-
ond and Jonti Bacharach in third. Brady
also won the 200-yard backstroke.

“We are definitely sending a message

to all the Big East competitors that we
swam [against] this year,” Brady said.
“Against Syracuse, Miami and now

“So they all know we are gunning for

at the edge of Trees pool and cheered.

Not a “Beat ‘Nova” cheer, but a cheer
telling themselves to “Get on up.” And
that’s what they did. They got up and
beat the Wildcats 128-115.

“It was an incredible meet, because I
think we had a little bit of doubt going in
as to whether we could beat them,”
senior captain Jen Burns said. “But we
stood up and raced these girls.”

And nobody raced them better than

Burns. She won both the 200-yard and
500-yard freestyles in convincing fashion.
But Burns’ firsts were only two—of-five on
the day for the Panthers. They won the
meet on the strength of their second-
through fourth-place finishes.

“We’ve had some leaders in the past
meets that were getting the firsts, like
Burns and [Laura] Zdyb,” junior Vicki
Geubtner said. “But there were swim-
mers, like myself and some others, that
weren’t getting the seconds and thirds
that we needed. That's what happened
today, we stepped up.”

Pitt opened the meet with second and
third-place finishes by their relay teams
in the 200-medley relay. And junior Zdyb

followed that with a first in the 1000-yard.

freestyle.

“I’ve been sick in the past couple of
weeks and I wasn’t quite sure what I was
going to do when I got in the water,”
Zdyb said. “So I just went in with a posi-
tive attitude and tried to do my best and
it came out pretty good.”

Sophomores Jenny Doran and Susan
Poorbaugh finished third and fourth,
respectively, behind Zdyb. -

Burns’ 200-yard freestyle victory was
next with Pitt junior Christy Knobloch
taking third in the event. Then Geubtner,
sophomore Alicia T ymes and sophomore
Chrissy DiLeonardo swam two, three,
four in the 50-yard freestyle. Senior cap-
tain Candie Burke and rookie Kara
Crombie placed second and fourth in the
200-yard individual medley. ‘

Rookie Charla Caponi, Doran, and
Burke took second, third and fourth in
the 200-yard butterfly and Geubtner,

Carol Morton, Pitt's most disruptive defender, was
limited by foul trouble and a stomach ailment.

"She wasn't feeling very good," Bruce said.
"Sl.e‘ll  ready to go Wc.inesday."

Both offensive stars from the first half struggled
in the second half. Colabrese took only four
shots, scoring four points.

Cur-ran kept shooting, but stopped making
them. She hit only two—of-ten attempts in the sec-
ond half. She finished the game with 25 points on
seven-of—22 shooting with six turnovers.

“Kerry Curran had a not-so-great day. She’s
usually a lot better,” Joyce said.

“Kerry looked a little hesitant out there. She had
a couple turnovers. Her shots weren’t falling and
she got a little frustrated. That hurt
them.” _

While Boston College had nobody to step up in
Curran’s place, Pitt had Joyce. The junior guard
scored 11 of her team-high 19 points (matching
Colabrese) in the second half.

Bruce said in the past that the team was waiting
for the game that both Colabrese and Joyce were
both playing well offensively at the same time.
This time it was different halves of the same
game.

“Finally,” Joyce said of the coinciding good
days for her and Colabrese.

“When one of us plays well, the other one
doesn’t have the greatest day. We needed it

“A team comes back  we make an adjustment

now.

“That comes from taking care of business out
there. Our record is nice, and we want to build
on that.”

The Panthers are entering an important week.
They hit the road Wednesday to visit Miami. Pitt
got its first win ever against the Hurricanes earlier
this season in Pittsburgh.

“Miami is going to be a big game,” Bruce said.
“It’s hard to win down there.”

Things get harder Friday at 5 p.m. when the
12th—ranked Connecticut Huskies make up the
game that was snowed— out two weeks ago at
Fitzgerald Field House.

“We’re trying for a [national] ranking,” Joyce
said. “We have to beat one of these big teams. We
have to beat UConn or Seton Hall. We want to
beat UConn bad.”

In the battle of speed,
the 50-yard freestyle was
all Pitt.

Zach Economos, Eric
Stull and Ryan Blair fin-
ished one, two and three
respectively.

Jonti Bacharach won
the 100—yard freestyle.
Stull and Economos
placed second and third.

“It was particularly
enjoyable with all the
sweeps we had,” head
coach Chuck Knoles said.
“Some of the sweeps we
had I did not expect to
sweep.”

Pitt almost swept the
distance race —— the 1000-
yard freestyle. After nine-
and-one—half minutes of
gruelling swimming Sam
Dommel came out on top
with Gary Mule second.

“This was la] big mental
booster for us,” said
Brady. “We needed to get
over the fact that we lost
the Big East title to these
guys last year, and we lost
it here.”

“Psychologically this
win was more important
as for [far] as the effects of
the season,” Knoles said.

“We needed to take
back the ownership of
our pool and feel good
about ourselves after the
loss last year."

In the last event, the
400-yard freestyle relay,
the swimmers were still
out for blood.

Bacharach, Williams,
Vartiainen and Sunseri
combined for the win.

Fortunately for the Huskies,
Pitt cOuldn’t'hold the whole

inside and Out, and exploited a
talent difference down the
homestretch to send the Field
House into silence and the
Panthers into fits.

After getting two points for a
takedown in a little Wrestling
match with UConn forward
Travis Knight in the first half,
Pitt forward Chris Gant was
whistled for a technical foul in
the second — one that seemed
to totally turn the tide into
COnnecticut’s favor.

the shot and if I have penetra-
tion I’m going to penetrate,”
Sheffer said. “I’m doing whatev-
er the defense is giving me.”

Which wasn’t a lot. When
UConn wasn’t running plays to
free the hot shooter (like shots
immediately Off an inbounds
pass) Sheffer fought through a
lot Of shirt-tuggin’ and pullin’ as
he tried to find his open shot.

“In Israel they dOn’t play
defense, but in Europe, Greek
teams and Spanish teams are
much more aggressive.”

Aside from first-half outbursts
from Shareef and guard Sotiris 
Aggelou (10 points), the crux of 
the Panther offense was sup-
plied by the 6-11 Mobley.

The uncharacteristically oft-
animated center, who played
strong defense in the paint,
knocked down seven-of-ten
shots from the ﬂoor and f1ve-Of-
seven from the line to garner 19
points to go along with his
team-high eight rebounds.

“We knew Mobley was a ter-
riﬁc player — he’s going to get
his points because he’s so
strong and so powerful,”
Dickenman said. “We tried to
