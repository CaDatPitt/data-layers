 

()'Connor lobbies state to avoid cuts in funding

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis'O’Connor has
requested a 6.8 percent increase in state.
funding for the next fiscal year from the
Pennsylvania Senate Appropriations
Committee. - _ ' D

However, O’Connor also said even
with the funding hike, Pitt may operate
with a multi-million dollar deficit.

“The 6.8 percent increase is based on
an extremely lean budget for [ﬁscal year]
1995,” O’Connor said.

“But even with this increase, the uni-
versity is -projecting a $3.5 million deficit
for the year that will require further cuts
throughout the institution.” '

According to Pitt’s Office of Public
Affairs, the requested increase would
raise funding to $148.7 million from this
year’s $139.3 million.

The further cuts, mentioned by
O’Connor, come one year after Pitt
implemented a cost reduction and con-
tainment program which reduced spend-
ing by almost $8 million.

O’Connor, who spoke before the

appropriations committee in Harrisburg A

on Wednesday, warned that the overall
quality of the university will suffer if

repeated budget cuts unscathed,” he said.

“The cumulative effect of seemingly
small reductions will ultimately under-
mine the extent and excellence of our
education, research and public service
facilities.” ‘

In light of these greater revenue needs,
O’Connor also criticized the current
requirements of the Tuition Challenge

Universal health care, giving
all Americans complete medical
coverage, is impossible to pro-
vide, according to Dr. Norman

Departments of Pediatrics and
History of Medicine at the
University of Wisconsin Medical
School. '

Fost, who served on President
Bill Clinton's Health Care Task
Force, delivered the annual
Alpha Omega Alpha lecture at
Pitt’s School of Medicine
Thursday.

“The central problem of not
just the Clinton plan, but the
whole health care debate, is not
even discussed  except with
condensation and disdain,” he
said. ‘ A
That problem, according to
Fost, is America’s “insatiable
demand for health care.”

“The American people are not
yet willing to even discuss giving
up any [health care benefitsl,” he
said.

All industrialized nations with
universal health care plans
ration their limited health care
resources in some fashion, Fost
said.

England, for example, rations

Canada rations based on the
costs of medical procedures.

In the United States, Fost said,
the ability to pay for health care

determines who receives med- ,

ical treatment.

“The United States is unique 
in our policy of rationing health
care on the basis of the ability to
pay,” he said. I
E According to Fost, many
Americans understand national
health care to include all neces-
sary health care procedures
regardless of demand. Because
health care resources are limited,
such coverage.is simply impossi-
ble.

“You can’t have ,eve1ything,”
Fost said. “Somebody is going to
have to give up something that
does not mean inconvenience,
but means death.”

While many argue this stance
is immoral, Fost said the victims
of rationing under the present
health care system are those
individuals whodie because
they cannot afford the care they
need. i S ,

Because the demand for
advanced health care exceeds
the medical system’s ability to
provide, Fost said rationing is
inevitable.

The second annual
Women in Development
Conference focused on
women as catalysts for
change.

The conference, organized
mainly by students from the
‘Graduate School of Public
and International Affairs, was
held this weekend in Forbes
Quad.

According to organizer
Flora Calderon-Steck, the
GSPIA students realized that
women were not included in

catalysts for change

the curriculum nor in any
specific class.

Calderon-Steck said, “We
felt that was a big vacuum
and we wanted to raise
awareness that development
is not gender—specif1c.”

The three—day conference
had many speakers from a
variety of international orga-
nizations. There were repre-
sentatives from the World
Bank, the Department of
Urban Planning, the Peace
Corps and the United States
Agency of International
Development.

The keynote address,

called “Recasting Women in

delivered Saturday evening
by Patricia Fernandez-Kelly.

The student group also rallied on "

March 4 to condemn Baruch

“Most students have nothing

they will be sympathetic to our
cause. We want people really to
know what we stand for and to

Greeks dance day away for S

By Rebecca Baker
Staff‘ Writer 2»

While most Pitt students slept
in yesterday morning, over 800
Greeks arrived at Metropol and
danced the day away in a 12-
hour marathon benefitting
Special Olympics.

This year’s marathon, “I’m Still
Alive,” featured music from the
1970s, but also played music
from the ‘80s and ‘90s for the
non-disco fan. By 10:30 a.m.,
fraternity and sorority members
were already whooping and

, whistling to the B-52s, Nine

Inch Nails and every other song
DJ Gene Barney played for
them.

“I like crowds like this,”
Barney said. “I’m having a good
time, and-I know they’re having
a great time.”

“I’ll tell you how enthused
they are,” Barney added. “I can’t
even play what I want because
I’m backed up with requests for

‘the next hour; And they’re so
'-varied that .1 can’t~-even 
, them!” ’  ~

/eicle oﬂ

wee/e with
ceremony

By Cameron Harvey
Staﬂ’ Writer

Yesterday afternoon Pitt engi-
neers emerged from Benedum
Hall to listen to live music as part
of the opening ceremonies for
this year’s Engineers Week.

Around 50 people participated
in the opening events with live
music provided by the
Callypsons.

With the theme being music
this year, each department repre-
sented a different style of music
ranging from reggae to disco to
holiday music. The goal of

Engineer’s Week is to have the

engineering students use what
they have learned while still hav-
ing fun.

According to Vicky Verbanec,
president of the Engineering
Student Council, Engineer’s
Week has been a tradition since
1949. Pitt engineers did not have
a spring break so they made up
for it through this special week.

v This year Jamey Chatlos and
Carrie Anderson, co-chairs for
Engineer’s Week, have been
responsible for setting up the
week-long schedule of events.

0 The events include:

-Today there will be Pitt
Monopoly at Benedum Hall at
noon. Each department has
made its own set of pieces which
will be judged during the game.

-Tuesday, “Ingenuity” — an
event where students must solve
engineering problems with the
best possible solutions —— will
take place.

-There will also be a joint
blood drive in Benedum Hall
with Phi Sigma Pi.

-Wednesday there will be a
Jeopardy tournament in the
William Pitt Union’s Dining
Room A at 7 p.m. According to
Verbanec, there is the possibility
of a faculty team, but nothing is
definite yet.

-Thursday’s event is
“Gimmick.” It will be at the Cost
Center from 2 to 5 p.m. and will
includevolleyball, tug-of—war, an
egg toss and a keg roll.

-Friday there will be an engi-
neering parade starting at
Benedum at 9:45 a.m. Each
department will have its own
ﬂoat. °Saturday there will be
the soap-box derby races at the
Chevron Building. According to
Verbanec, each department puts
a lot of time into the cars, trying
to get them to meet the many
regulations. E

-Saturday evening there will
be an Engineer’s Ball.

“The last couple of years there
has been a lull in the turnout,”
said Verbanec. “But a lot more
people are interested in it this
year. We’ve put up huge banners
everywhere.”

According to Verbanec,
Engineer’s Week is comparable
to Greek Week.

“It’s a big tradition at the uni-
versity,” said senior Frank
Fischer. “It gives the engineers a
chance to get out. It’s about as
wild as engineers get.” A

Greeks sponsor carnival

By Jennifer McGinnis
For The Pitt News

The rain did not stop Pitt
Greeks from coming out to
the Greek Week spring car-
nival for Special Olympics
this weekend. However,
some snow did stop the
Special Olympians from

coming.
Carnival chair Stephanie
King estimated that

1,000 Greeks attended the
event at Pitt Stadium Friday
night.

“Unfortunately, due to a
lot of snow in their area only
three or four Special
Olympians showed up,”
King said.

King said there were
approximately 21 booths at
the carnival. These booths
ranged from fish ponds
sponsored by Delta Zeta and
Sigma Sigma Sigma to a
Theta Phi Alpha bubble-

blowing contest. Some oth-
ers included the Delta Delta
Delta face—painting booth
and the Delta Phi tape-ball
toss.

“Many, many hours went
into the carnival,” King said.
“[Greeks] had to develop an
idea, provide the equipment
and prizes for the booth,
come early to set up and
make sure it would be a suc-
cess,” King added.

Special Olympian Dawn
Gipson said she was having
a good time and enjoyed
playing the Kappa Kappa
Gamma tic—tac—toe game
where she won candy lip-
stick.

First-year Delta Phi broth-
er Kimon Knaelakis
described the carnival as a
contest between the fraterni-
ties and sororities to see
who could make the best
game, and a fun event for
the Special Olympians.

Pitt would stand to gain an
additional $4.2 million in state
funding if terms of the plan
could be met. The plan requires
a" 4.5 percent cap on tuition
hikes at state-related and state-
owned universities.

It offers an additional $200
per full—time undergraduate stu-
dent who is a Pennsylvania resi-
dent.

O'Connor said problems with
the programs allocation formula
include that it does not take into
account the additional costs of
educating professional and grad-
uate students.

He also said part-time stu-
dents, who make up a large per-
centage of Pitt’s undergraduate

0 population, are not counted by

the program.

“The Tuition Challenge Grant
Program ’ also contradicts
the long—standing practice
of granting each public universi-
ty an equal percentage appropri-
ation increase,” O’Connor
said.

“If continued over a period
of years, this policy will put Pitt
at a serious disadvantage and
further hinder efforts to maintain
and enhance the quality of edu-
cation offered at each institu-
tion.”

O’Connor told the committee
he was willing to work with the
state to develop a more effective
method to allocate state funds to
colleges and universities.

“Ration we must,” he said.
“Everybody in the world has fig-
ured that out except us.”

In the present health care
debate, however, Americans are
hesitant to sacriﬁce any category
of medical coverage in favor of a
system which provides basic
coverage for all Americans.

The necessary exclusion of
certain kinds of care or age
groups to support national
health care spawns an ethical
debate which will undermine
reform efforts, said Fost, who

served on the Ethics Committee
of the Task Force.

“Until Americans in large num-
bers say they are willing to give
something up, there will be no
change,” he said. “If [national
health care] covered everything,
you’d have the [present] health
care system.”

According to Fost, Americans
pay the most for their health
care, and the present system
covers the smallest percentage
of citizens of any nation’s health
care system.

About $80 billion annually

goes to clerks and executives of
the 1,500 American insurance
companies, he said.

In addition, Fost said health
care costs are the most common
cause of financial ruin and fami-
ly bankruptcy in the United
States.

The U.S. system is also the
least accessible to the sick, who
need coverage the most,
because many private corporate
insurers only cover relatively
healthy Americans, Fost said.

being insensitive to AIDS
patients and other expensive
clients, Fost said, private Health
Maintenance Organizations can
tailor their clientele to include
only healthy individuals.

“The devil must have designed
[the present health care systeml,”
he said.

The proposed Clinton plan is
based on managed health care,
in which “purchasing coopera-
tives” collect health care dollars
and “accountable health insur-
ance,” similar to HMOs, compete
for consumer money by offering
the items included in the
National Health Bill at competi-
tive prices, he said.

According to Fost, “consumer
satisfaction report cards,” listing
items such as cost, waiting time
for services and quality of care,
would help consumers choose
between competing plans.

Because coverage is deter-
mined by the National Health
Bill, consumers know exactly
what service they will receive for
their health care premiums, elim-
inating the confusion of the pre-
sent system, he said.

According to Fost, consumers
may opt to pay additional sup-

“This is not socialized medi-
cine,” Fost said. “It is a way to
organize present health care dol-
lars.”

Since the company with the
best quality and lowest price
would woo the most consumers,
the plan would theoretically
lower health care costs and raise
quality of service, Fost said.

Under this system, health
insurers theoretically “have a
powerful incentive to produce a
product which is inexpensive,”
Fost said.

Because of its failure to ration
health care along with other
questionable assumptions, Fost
said the Clinton plan will be
unsuccessful.

Doctors, trying to remain
aﬂoat in a competitive market
would perform more tests and
offer more check—ups, would
raise overall health care costs,
undermining the plan’s attempt
to reduce health care expenses,
Fost said.

“Historically, competition
leads to a rise in costs,” he said.

Fost cited an experiment in the
Canadian province of Manitoba,
in which the number of health
care providers was doubled. The
experiment was expected to rad-
ically increase the population of
Manitoba, as business and indus-

try, lured by low health care
costs,_relocated there.

Instead, the glut of physicians
forced those physicians to per-
form more procedures to survive
in the market, and health care
costs rose 70 percent in
Manitoba.

Another reason the Clinton
plan will fail, according to Fost,
is the plan’s exclusion of compa-
nies with over 100 employees
who are satisﬁed with their pre-
sent health care coverage.

These corporate plans tradi-
tionally contain healthy, low-
cost health care individuals.

This “cherry picking,” Fost
said, removes healthy individu-
als from the health care pool
who would otherwise absorb
some of the cost of treating sick
individuals under the national
plan. “The whole idea of man-
aged health care depends on a
sense of community,” he said.

If healthy individuals do not
contribute to the national plan,
sick individuals under the
national plan will not have
enough financial resources to
cover their care.

According to Fost, another
shortcoming of the Clinton plan
is the “ambiguity of beneﬁts.”

“I personally cannot tell what
is in [the Clinton beneﬁts pack-
agel,” he said.

For example, Fost said “repro—
ductive counseling” is covered
under the Clinton plan. This
includes “genetic testing,” which
can determine risks of develop-
ing diseases such as cystic ﬁbro-
sis, Alzheimer’s disease,
Huntington’s disease and breast
cancer.

The plan does not state, how-
ever, which of these diseases
will be included in genetic test-
ing. These tests could cost $1-2
billion annually for each disease,

tested, he said.

The debate over abortion cov- -

erage alone, Fost said, “will by
itself undermine the whole
plan.” Because the plan does not
mention speciﬁcally which pro-
cedures are covered under cate-
gories like reproductive counsel-
ing, nobody knows how much
the Clinton plan will actually
cost to implement, he said.

The Clinton plan “has no clear
way of preserving academic
[medical] centers,” such as Pitt’s
medical system or the University
of Wisconsin Medical Center,

Fost said.

These centers, because of the
inherent inefﬁciencies and costs
of academic centers such as resi-
dencies and libraries, could not
compete under the Clinton plan
without subsidies. “That was ter-
rifying to me,” Fost said. “We’ll
go out of business quickly.”

Fost concluded no real health
care reforms will come about
until Americans are more willing
to sacriﬁce some medical cover-
age to shift resources towards a
universal health care system.

“Vested interests are too pow-

erful, and not enough people are
being hurt badly enough,” Fost
said.

If the current health care crisis
helps to control costs, Fost said
universal basic coverage may
become a reality in 10 or 15
years. Fost gives Clinton “enor-
mous credit for at least putting
this issue on the front bumer.

“Nobody was talking about
improving access five years
ago,” he said. “Clinton was the
first to run based on the argu-

Conference  

Continued from page 1
and her recent research is in the
role of women in global econo-
my.”

Fernandez-Kelly said gender
roles are an adaptation to eco-
nomic .and political situations
and that current gender expec-
tations have developed since
the Industrial Revolution.

She said, “Our idea is fairly
recent and not an eternal defini-
tion. Men were not expected
to support women and children
for most of history. Women
were expected to contribute.”

Fernandez-Kelly also said the
expectation that men are to be
the breadwinners has placed
men in a position where their
gender identity is dependent on
their ability to be providers.

Diana Brandi‘, a graduate stu-
dent from the School of
Education. Administration and
Policy Studies, said, “A confer-
ence like this brings together
women to talk about issues. We

have a long way to go, but
there have been great strides
made in terms of how people
see development.”

Brandi said it is important for
all people to get the opportuni-
ty to have certain human rights
such as employment, educa-
tion, housing and a sense of
dignity. She said, “We can’t do
that without involving women
in the process at all levels.”

Calderon—Steck said, “The
exchange of ideas have been
very dynamic. To me, that
shows people are concerned
and want to learn.

sored by Pitt’s Center for Latin

MSA

Continued from page 1
Islam has attracted many fol-
lowers in the United States
but is simultaneously repre-
sented negatively in the
American press.

Idriss said, “You read a lot
about things that are anti-
Islamic in the West, yet peo-
ple come to be Muslims in
large numbers from all walks
of life.”

He said Islam is a positive
choice for many Americans
because it provides its follow-
ers with inner peace.
According to Idriss, Islam has
a lot in common with many
other religions and respects
them all.

Idriss said Muslims, like fol-
lowers of the Judeo-Christian
faith, believe in a universal
God, holy scriptures, divine
messengers and Judgment
Day. Although Islam primarily
believes in Mohammed and
the Koran, he said Islam also
recognizes Jesus as a prophet
and parts of the Bible as holy
scripture.

MSA member Hayati Akyol
agreed. “This speech was
good to clarify the contradic-
tory points between Muslims
and non—Muslims.”

Idriss said the media often
associates Islam with violence

and subjugation of its follow-
ers. He said the media often
represents Islam by using “a
big sword with blood drip-
ping on the hands.” On the
contrary, Islam is concerned
with peace and respect for
other people, he said.

Jaffar Crim, a Muslim who
attended the lecture, said
Idriss “made nice points about
Americans who accept Islam
in this country because that is
what I did.”

One week after Baruch
Goldstein, a Jewish settler,
murdered 50 Muslims praying
in a mosque, the MSA held a
rally at the William Pitt Union
to promote a Muslim interpre-
tation of the massacre and
raise Muslim consciousness
on campus.

Said Yasin, organizer of the
rally, said students are not
getting the full View of the
massacre.

“The media in the U.S. has
not covered it the way it hap-
pened. What we have seen
on TV is really nothing,” he
said.

The MSA said more than
one terrorist was involved in
the attack,the Israeli military
allowed the individuals into
the mosque knowing they
were armed and soldiers did

not halt the terrorists until it
was over 20 minutes later.

Crim also attended the rally
and said he believes current
information about the mas-
sacre has misled the public.
“Some of the things in the
American media were not
some of the things we heard
from people who were there.”

Al-Sahrawi said there
were four speakers at the
rally, including a member of
the PLO, a Schenley High
School student who is presi-
dent of the Muslim Youth
of North America, a Jewish
Pitt professor who con-
demned the massacre and a
professor from Ohio
University. He said there were
approximately 100-150 peo-
ple in attendance.

Al-Sahrawi said the event
was part of the empowerment
process. “We should not just
let the Israeli perspective or
Zionist perspective prevail.
We have lots of Muslims, [we
need to] instill a capacity in
our people to get together
and do something.”

He said the MSA will
continue promoting its point
of View by bringing more
lecturers to Pitt and pos-
sibly creating an MSA
newsletter.

Don't lose sight of ethics

The health care debate rages on, and one important
concern in deciding the issue is ethics. There are a
number of concerns that must be addressed, one of
which is the way in which health care is rationed.

The way America currently rations health care (care
only to those who can afford it) is unethical and must
go. In a lecture at Pitt’s School of Medicine, Dr.
Norman C. Fost hit the nail on the head when he said,
“The United States is unique  in our policy of
rationing health care on the basis of .the ability to pay.”
Despite the pain involved, however, some form of
rationing must take place.

Other nations, especially those with universal, social-
ized medicine, ration health care on varied criteria. As
the prospect of universal coverage becomes more real,
the United States must examine rationing systems
throughout the world and develop an,ethical system
which can allow for a reasonable system of controlling
the ﬂow of services. '

According to Post, Canada rations on the basis of the
price of different medical procedures and England pro-
vides coverage only up to acertain age. “You ca_n’t
have everything,” Fost said, “Somebody is going to
have to give up something  _

Determining what has to be given up is the dilemma
facing health care experts, government officials and
ethicists. They are struggling with this question as they
prepare different bills to go in front of Congress.

The costs of procedures necessary for survival cannot
take a backseat to other things which are less serious
in nature. A list needs to be generated which would be
able to make clear to insurance providers what sort 'of
therapeutic methods would be used. In addition, costs
for procedures must be controlled. The focus of medi-
cine must be switched to one of a balance of preventa-
tive measures and curative measures for all people. If
the focus is on one or another, there will not be
enough participants to pay for coverage. According to
Fost, the Clinton plan will allow companies with more
than 100 employees who are satisfied with their cur-
rent health care plan to buy out of the national plan,
which will remove healthy individuals from the system
who would help make up the cost of those who need

’ treatment.

What must be remembered is that healthy citizens are
of paramount importance to a healthy nation. Health
care concerns affect everyone, and the current system
is not providing coverage to a large portion of society.
Congress should also take ethics into account as health
care plans are bantered about. ‘

Even though they are dealing in the law, economics

and pragmatism, a level of ethical consideration must

be maintained as these plans are designed. Only in this
way can health care really be made to work for the

population.

“Heterosexual sex is rape.”

I ran across that arresting
quote while reading a theater
review in the local newsweekly
In Pittsburgh a couple of
months ago. _

Upon first glance, it seemed
to be a remark that a misan-
thropic feminist or a homosex-

, ual activist would make —— but

now that I think about it, it’s
probably not far from the truth.

These days, unfortunately,
people of both genders misuse
sex to gain power to the point
that, ultimately, the sex itself
isn’t really the issue.

Often both men and women

approach each other just to
prove to their friends -— and,
sadly, to themselves —— just
how much sexual power they
possess and find themselves in
the dead-end game of seduc-
tion. —
Remember also that the
crime of rape has essentially
the same objective, conquest,
and it is for this reason the two
are comparable.

As one anonymous writer
put it, “The only difference
between rape and seduction is
the sales job.”

Men are usually assigned
blame for this problem, and I
have to admit thatwe probably
deserve most of it.

Often we are encouraged to
become sexually active during
adolescence (when I was 15,
my father talked about taking

my brother and me to a prosti- ‘

tute), and losing one’s virginity
has been considered a rite of
passage for decades.

Then again, most of the skin
mags, some of the music and
even advertising reflect the
possibility of male sexual grati-
fication.

The annual swimsuit issue of
Sports Illustrated isn’t the best-
seller for nothing, and it was

. no accident that the Olivia

Newton-John song “Physical”
went to the top of the charts.

I don’t know if it’s because ‘

such men fear real intimacy or
rejection or that they secretly

People need playmates not power plays

hate women, but a lot of us do
tend. to turn women into
objects.

And what often happens is
that a lot of men can’t tell the »
difference between consensual
sex and forced sex.

At a party I attended a num-
ber of years ago, a Chatham
College student was literally
being molested in full View of
everyone, and I have to admit.
that my first response was,
“Well, she must have wanted

Rick
N owlin

it.” I

How did I know — did she
really want to have sex with
the guy or was she simply too
drunk to resist?

Women, however, must
share at least some of the
responsibility for this shameful
state of affairs.

A couple of years ago,
Towson State University
released the results of a survey
on “date rape.”

It also noted that the vast
majority of college men who
forced themselves sexually on
women were either members
of fraternities or varsity ath-
letes.

I wasn’t at all surprised, as it
is those very men that women
are often attracted to in the first
place, and our culture says that
theseuare the most desirable
men because of their status.

I should know, since I’m a
fratemity alumnus and a former
basketball player; that’s at least
part of the reason I got some
attention from the girls.

In truth, about two-thirds of
the women I met at Pitt 11-13
years ago I met through the
Greek system.

Part of the problem is that
they make themselves more
available and thus set them-
selves up, especially when the

brew begins to flow freely.
Athletes especially are likely
to be sexually active, as they
are lavished with worship as
early as the sixth grade, and by
the time they reach college

they see sexual contact as a

Civil right.

My brother, also a former
basketball player who walked
on at WVU, told me that “if
you’re an athlete [there], you
can get all the sex you want.”

A former football player at
the University of Oklahoma
who was convicted‘ of rape

- said frankly that there were

women who slept with team-
mates and then broadcast “who
could and who couldn’t.”
Whetlier we want to admit it
or not, we men are victims too,
and it’s particularly tough on
those guys who really believe
in treating women right.
So why don’t a lot of jocks

and frat boys respect women?
Why should they, when if one

woman doesn’t please them
they can just get another?

So wl1at’s the answer? Well,
for openers, we can stop trying
to play games and learn to
enjoy each other for our own
sake.

I" referred in a previous col-
umn to a woman in Chicago
named Carol, and the best way
I can describe our relationship
is that were, well, playmates.
(No, not THAT kind.)

Now, I happen to think she’s
kinda cute, but she’ll never win
a Miss America contest, and I
know I’ll never be confused
with Billy Dee Williams — and
that’s OK.

Neither of us? believes in sex
outside of marriage, but then
again, the emotional intimacy
we share almost makes sex
irrelevant.

So maybe that’s the solution
to our dilemma — perhaps we
should look for playmates

'rather than sex partners.

Anyone for a game of tag?

McEachern "estatic" to be home in the ‘Burgh

By Dan Lauso
Staff Writer

here’s an old saying that
, says “you can never go
home again,” or something

to that effect.

But don’t tell that to the
Pittsburgh Penguins’ Shawn
McEachern, who has tri-
umphantly returned to the
Penguins’ lineup since his
return trade from ‘the Los
Angeles Kings. -

Fans have ‘welcomed
McEachern back to his old

' stomping grounds with various

signs and an ensemble of bois-
terous applause as the public
address announcer has picked
up where he left off since the

off-season trade sent McEachern '

to the Kings for strongman
Marty McSorley.-

The enthusiasm has gone
both ways as McEachern is
equally glad to be back in
Pittsburgh. V

“I’m ecstatic to be back in
Pittsburgh,” McEachern said.

“I like playing in Pittsburgh,
and‘I’m glad they wanted me
back.” .

McEachern became Penguin

LAX team suﬂers
first loss ofseozsoni

By Adam Pincus
Staff Writer 2

You could see the disappointment on the faces of the Pitt
men’s -lacrosse team Saturday afternoon as the team walked

off the Pitt Stadium field.

“Hopefully this is a wake—up call to the guys,” head coach
Gary Neft said of the team’s first 1os§, a 13-11 defeat. “I am
very disappointed. I don’t think we played very well at all.”

It was the team’s first loss of the year, and it dropped its

record to 4-1 overall.

Their opponent was division rival Fredonia (N.Y.) Stat
whose status is Division III, as opposed to Pitt’s club team.

The Panthers really seemed to be pumped up prior to the
game. Not just for the fact that they were playing outside for
the‘ first time this season, but also because they were antici-
pating a tough match from Fredonia State.

Their enthusiasm was evident in the early going as Pitt
jumped out to their usual quick lead as Josh Gochnaur put

them up 1-0.

However, things began to go sour as Fredonia State came

up with four unanswered goals. This flurry stymied the Alabama Relays’ TBA
Panthers and took them out of their game. It was truly the
first time all year that the team looked as though they were
intimidated.

When a team is used to dominating and controlling a
game, they sometimes force things and try too hard. That
was the problem that Pitt faced. .

They were able to cut the lead to 6-3 at halftime, thanks
to two goals by Andrew Hutchinson.

The second half meant a second chance for Pitt. Would
the team remain ﬂat or turn up the level of play a notch?

Jerry and the Jerry-aires waitingfor new coach to

Anyone who follows Pitt bas-
ketball can tell you that the
1993-94 season was not a mem-
orable one. The season ended
on a sour note with the turmoil
associated with the end of head
coach Paul Evans’ tenure, a
nine-game losing streak, and a
disappointing 13-14 record.
However, no matter how bad
things may seem, there is
always next season to look for-
ward to. Here is a rundown of
the players returning and what
will be needed from them.

-Jerry McCullough, senior
point guard.

The undisputed leader of the
team will be back to run the
show once again. He was sec-
ond on the team in scoring with
a 13.3 average. With the grad_ua-
tion of Eric Mobley, whoever
the new coach is will most like-
ly expect McCullough to put the
ball in the hole more often. He
is solid at the point. A

-Orlando Antigua, senior’
small forward.

Orlando, who had a career
scoring average of 5.6 had a
breakthrough year in which he.
was third on the team in scoring
with a 10.7 average, including a
career—high 20 against cross-

town rival Duquesne. He shot a
sizzling 42 percent from three-
point land and led the team
with 47 total buckets from
beyond the arc.

However, there were a few
games, such as the ‘Connecticut
game, in which he shot horribly
from the field. Antigua showed
range on his jumper and played
his usual aggressive defense,
but he must become more con-
sistent. He will most likely be
the starter at small forward.

Brett
Fondrk

-Chris Gant, senior power
forward.

Gant came into the season
looking to be in the best shape
of his career and it paid off as
he led the Panthers in rebound-

‘ ing six times and finished sec-

ond to Mobley with 167 caroms.

There is no doubt that he can
rebound. He also took it upon
himself to be the unofficialteam

enforcer. His aggressiveness, .

especially in the North Carolina

game when he didn’t back
down against center Eric
Montross, often fired up the
team. But he will have to pick
up his game offensively. He and
Willie Cauley will battle for the
starting position.

0 Jaime Peterson, senior cen-
ter. Peterson, a junior college
transfer, was a capable backup
to Mobley. He scored in double-
digits in five games and provid-
ed a spark off the bench at both
ends of the court. With the loss
of 7-foot—4-inch recruit Thomas
Hamilton, Peterson is the only
center on the team. The ques-
tion is whether or not his 200-
pound frame can handle the
pounding a center takes during
a full Big—East season.

-Garrick Thomas,
guard.

Thomas, a streaky shooter, is
best remembered for his three-
pointer late in the game against
Seton Hall during his rookie
year to clinch Pitt’s' 76-73 upset
win. He showed ﬂashes of bril-
liance this season, as his 21-
point outburst against Robert
Morris attested. Thomas can
play a number of positions, but
regardless of where he plays, he
will have to put the ball on the

floor more. Look for him to
challenge for a starting position.

-Andre Aldridge, junior
guard. ,

Aldridge filled in admirably
the last two games of the season
when McCullough "went down
with a hand injury, especially
with his nine points, four
assists, and no turnovers in the
Panthers’ tournament loss to St.
Johns. Aldridge will most likely
get more playing time next year
as he will be groomed to take
over the point-guard duties
when McCullough graduates. At

times this season, Aldridge
looked tentative. He will
become more relaxed as his
playing time increases. He will
be called upon to ease
McCullough’s load next season.
-Willie Cauley, senior for-
ward. , -
Cauley was having a fine sea-
son, scoring in double digits in
nine games before being
thrown in Evans’ doghouse for
the latter part of the season.
Cauley, who is not afraid to
throw around his muscle, is a

strong rebounder who also
possesses a decent touch
from the perimeter. At times
his shot selection was sus-
pect, but look for him to bat-
tle Gant for the starting nod
at power forward. H

°Jason Maile, sophomore
guard.

Maile averaged 4.2 points
a game off the Pit: bench. He
nailed 19 treys and had a
career-high 14 points in the
final game against St. John’s.
Maile, who averaged 34

points a game as a high_

school senior, will be looked
upon to bring this type of
scoring to the Big East. His
quickness and endurance are
questionable. He will con-
tend for the start at shooting
guard.

-Sotiris Aggelou, sopho-
more guard.

Aggelou hit a number of
big treys this season includ-
ing the late—season leaner
that sent the BC game into
OT. When he’s on, he is a
deadly shooter with almost-
limitless range. He started
four games and had a high of
17 against Buffalo before his
season was shortened by a
wrist injury. Aggelou must
improve his shooting off the

dribble. He will battle
Thomas and Maile for the
start at tWO.

°Shaun Koontz, senior for-
ward.

Koontz, a walk-on,
appeared in eight games and
earned playing time with his
aggressive play in practice. It
is not known whether or not
he will have to walk—on next
year.

-Derek Jones, senior

guard. '
‘ He appeared in four
games and hit a three-point-
er against Robert Morris. His
status as a walk-on is also
unknown.

-Recruits.

At this point, there are
none. Without a coach, don’t
look for Pitt to land any blue-
chip prospects. Whoever the
coach is will probably have
to grab some junior-college
transfers.

-Coach.

It’s completely up in the
air. John Calipari, Rick
Majerus, who knows? One
thing is for certain — they
had better get somebody
soon. Thenucleus for the
team is intact, they just need
someone to lead them.

Well, Pitt came out tough and
fought back one goal at a time.
The equalizer came at 9:28 of
the third quarter as Eric Seamen
put the ball in the top-right cor-
ner of the goal to beat the
Fredonia State goalie and tie the
game at six.

At this point, the game took
on a whole new style as the two
teams began trading goals;

Fredonia was first, regaining
the lead at 7-6. Then only sec-
onds later Pitt was able to tie it
back up at seven.

Things were starting to slow
down again when Darrell

Schmitt scored at 4:11 of the
third quarter to put Pitt back ‘up.
The Panthers were starting to
put a smile back on Neft’s face.

The third quarter eventually
ended at 8-8, and the teams
entered the fourth quarter with
the momentum in Pitt’s hands.

The Panthers wasted little
time as they scored at the 14:15
mark of the final quarter to go
ahead once more by a 9-8 mar-
gin. Only nine seconds later,
however, the game was tied at
9-9.

How quick the tables turned,
as Fredonia State scored the
next three goals to send its lead

back up to three, at 12-9.

After coming back, Pitt now
faced another three-goal deficit,
and this time they only had 8:35

or it was over.

They were able to come back
and reduce the lead to 12-11 at
the 3:04 mark. Then, with 1:30
a
to organize their
thoughts and that the last stab at

remaining, the Panthers called
timeout

scoring.

However, Fredonia came out
of the timeout and scored to
make it 13-11, which ended up

as the final score.

worked out for either team as
either player ever fit into their
new surroundings.

McEachern fell out of favor
with Kings head coach Barry
Melrose because of his lack of
scoring.

McSorley never fit in his role
as a stay-at—home defenseman
with the Pens. So both players
were traded back to their origi-
nal teams along with Tomas
Sa-ndstrom for Jim Paek last
month.

McEachern made an immedi-
ate impact for the Penguins,
recording three points and
being a plus three for the

evening his first night back.

McEachern brought down the
house with a beautiful break-
away goal, beating Hartford
goalie Sean Burke through the
five-hole.

“When I got into the clear, I
said to myself, ‘I’ve got to score
here,” McEachern said.

“I was pretty nervous before
the game, I wasn’t even able to
sleep [the night beforel,” he
said.

“I think I’ll be able to sleep
pretty good tonight though.”

The Pens’ view of McEachern
still seems to be fairly high.

McEachern has played a lot of

minutes and has even played in

Mario Lemieux’s spot a great
deal on the number—one line.
He has killed penalties and
even played in many of the
four-on—four situations for the
Pens.

McEachern even received
high praise from his new head
coach, Eddie Johnston.

“McEachern again, we talked
about faceoffs — he [has beenl
very good on the faceoffs,”
Johnston said.

While in Los Angeles,

McEachern only scored eight
goals and 21 assists despite liv-
ing in one of America’s most
ideal climates. The change back
to a winter climate seems to fit
  well for McEachern.
 Z When told that there aren’t
‘ " any palm trees in
Pittsburgh, McEachern shot
back, “There are no earth-
quakes either.”

Perhaps it’s the change in
scenery that has
helped McEachern pick up
where he left off last sea-
son.

matic and it didn’t hap-
pen,” Luke Fox said. “I
think we’ll pick it up the
rest of the season. I don’t
mind the loss now, as
long as it doesn’t hurt our
playoff chances.”

“It’s only our first loss,
so we’ll take it as a lesson
rather than a downer,”
defenseman John Fotis
said.

“If you get down on
yourself, the season tends
to slump. We’ll get right
back at them tomorrow.
We’re not high school
kids anymore, we’ll have
to suck it up and come
out tough from here.”
