IFC plans charity Came-a—thon

By Brendan Kevenides
Staff Writer I

The |nterFraternity Council
announced at a board meeting
last night that the 1988 Frater-
nity Game-a-thon to benefit
the Special Olympics will be
held on Oct. 29 and 30.

At this event, people are ex-
pected to choose a game from
a variety of festivities (ranging
from billiards to board games)
and play it for a period of 24
hours.

Each person participating in
the Game-a-than will be
responsible for acquiring
monetary pledges based on
the amount of time that each
participant is able to continu-
ously play. This money will be
presented at the end of the

" Game—a-thon to the Special

Olympics fund in the name of
Pitt's Greek system.

”The Game-a—thon is an
event cosponsored by the IFC
and Panhel and is designed to
promote unity and fun for the
Greeks,” said IFC President
Chuck Farinella.

Farinella said that other
Greek fund—raising activities to
benefit the Special Olympics,
such as selling candy, are en-
couraged at this event.

Farinella also explained that
anyone participating in the
Game-a-thon will be elligible
to challenge him, a nationally
ranked pool player, to a game
of pool.

Farinella said, ’’The laser
will pay one dollar to the Spe-
cial Olympics. If I lose, the
money will come out of the
IFC treasury.”

The person who beats him
the most times will win a two-
piece cue stick valued at $65,
said Farinella.

Also at the IFC meeting,
board member Dave Chap-
pano announced that Florida
State University has banned all
parties in which kegs of beer
are involved. He said that all
persons 21 years of age or
older who attend fraternity
parties at FSU must bring their
own alcohol if they wish to
drink.

The board also announced
that first—round nominations
for those who strive for IFC
board membership. next year
will be held at the next board
meeting on Nov. 1. The elec-
tion will take place on Nov.
15.

The Allegheny County Health
Department recently announced
that the number of local AIDS
cases has reached 200, including
the first reported case ofga child
contracting the disease.

”We can't predict that we'll see
fewer cases than last year,” said
Guillermo Cole Jr., an informa-
tion officer for the county health
department.

The county's first pediatric case
occurred this year. The case in-
volves a preschool child who ap-
parently acquired the infection
before or during birth. Cole said,

Police
report
decrease
in crime

By Michelle L. O'Brien
Staff Writer

Reported incidents of burglary
in the South Oakland area have
decreased recently, according to
John Cousins,’ crime analysis
officer at Pittsburgh's Zone 6
police station.

- Cousins said the Zone 6 station
in Squirrel Hill, which also
polices Oakland, has received
only three reports of_ burglary in
South Oakland so far this month.
He estimated the normal rate is
”one or two per day.”

”[The rate of burglary] has
dropped considerably since July
and August," Cousins said. He
stated the drop is partially due to
the return of students for the fall
term. ”With roommates, usually
one or the other is there most of
the time.” However, he cau-
tioned, some instances of theft
are the result of roommates who
”borrow” from each other.

Cousins also noted the decline
refers only to reported cases of
burglary. The actual rate of bur-
glary could conceivably be
higher, he said. ”A ‘lot of times,
roommates and neighbors, who
are supposed to be looking out
for each other, are reluctant to get
involved. I don't know why they
don't think it's important
enough,” he continued.

old. At least 26 pediatric cases
have been reported elsewhere in
Pennsylvania.” .
Cole said that 142 of the cases
involved homosexual and bisex-
ual men. Hemophiliacs and
blood transfusion recipients ac-

count for 20 cases. Seventeen

cases are attributed to in-
travenous drug users. People who
are both gay and drug shooters
make up six cases.

Heterosexual transmission has
been linked to four AIDS cases.
The 11 remaining cases in Al-
Iegheny County could not be
classified by risk group as a result
of insufficient data. a

Governor Casey
signs Superfund bill

HARRISBURG (AP) - Gov.
Robert P. Casey signed legislation
Tuesday creating a state-level
hazardous waste cleanup pro-
gram, vowing to use the law's
muscle to snare polluters and
build a legacy of environmental
protection.

With Casey's endorsement of
the bill, Pennsylvania becomes
one of only four states with toxic
cleanup laws. The program will
use a combination of business
taxes and state dollars to restore

an estimated 250 state and feder-

During a ceremony at the cap-
ital, Casey signed the bill while
flanked by more than two dozen
lawmakers, lobbyists and other
officials, some of whom had bit-
terly fought over provisions in the
legislation.

”Today we're taking the final
step in the yearlong effort to es-
tablish a program that attacks the
environmental challenges we
face,” Casey said.

Casey’s action comes just five
days after House and Senate
members unanimously approved
the compromise waste bill, end-

Clinic helps families cope with problem children

By Erin Flynn
Staff Writer

Since Sept. 29, the Child Con-
duct Clinic at Pitt has been help-
ing families with children who
have impulsive or aggressive be-
havior problems. This research
program, originally a part of
Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic's in— service, now functions
as an out—patient clinic.

This clinic created a program
for ’’problem’’ children, aged
seven to 12, and their concerned
parents. The majority of the kids
involved in the program are
difficult to manage at home, as

well as in school. The director,
Alan Kazdin, developed a sys-
tematic approach to handle these
aggressive children and to teach
their parents a positive way to
reinforce it.

The Child Conduct Clinic helps‘

two kinds of children. The aggres-
sive child who has constant op-
positional tempers and is known
to steal, set fire to objects and
destroy property, is one type,
while the other is the impulsive
child.

Parents with impulsive children
will realize they are being disrup-
tive in school, refusing to get
along with peers and diagnosed

with a ”tension deficient
disorder.”

The therapy that the clinic pro-
motes is presenting the child with
”problem-solving skills.” Its pur-
pose is to help them stop and
think about a solution to a situa-

tion without showing signs of ag-
gressive or impulsive actions. The
child is given a situation and must
review the five steps that were
taught earlier.

First, the child must define the
problem, followed by the analy-

sis of the possibilities that could
occur. The child continues to fo-
cus on the consequences of the
situation. If the answer is correct
as to which approach should be
taken, a reward is given. The next

He said the chances of police

step is for the child and therapist
to evaluate the results to see if
they were ”nice and slow.”

The therapist also practices
role-playing with them, and re-
quires assignments to be done at
home, and reported on by the
parents.

The parents are also a main fo-
cus in the clinical process and are
given the same amount of instruc-
tion. They are taught ”appropri-
ate parenting skills” in an attempt
to change behaviors, and to en-
courage cooperative attitudes.
Management skills are learned,
along with an emphasis on posi-
tive reinforcement. The mother
and father are told to “set definite

limits,” and to demand effective ‘

punishment. They are also en-
couraged to start a ”reward sys-
tem” in the home. The therapist
deals with one set of parents at a
time and does not preach to a
group of parents. The help is per-
sonal and on an individual basis.

Elaine Weissberg of the Child
Conduct Clinic said that the ”par-
ents’ major difficulty with these
children is controlling them. 
The goal of the Child Conduct
Clinic is to change the child's be-
havior. The child’s low self-
esteem rises as more self-control
is gained.”

The program to help the par-
ents is a 16-week process, while
the child's therapy takes up to 24
weeks. Close Contact is main-
tained with the families between
weekly sessions to assist with any
problems that may occur.

The Child Conduct Clinic is lo-
cated on the fifth floor of the

The first AIDS casein Alleghe-

”We can report that there will

ing such mortality data in 1986.

French theorist wins Nobel prize for economics

  STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) —
Maurice Allais, a prolific theorist
whose ideas on balancing supply
and demand helped rebuild the
French economy after World War
ll, won the Nobel Prize for eco-
nomics Tuesday.

Allais, a Paris shopkeeper’s
son, became mentor to a genera-
tion of economists. He developed
formulas to enable large enter-
prises, particularly public ones, to
keep an economy in balance by
regulating prices and allocating
their resources.

After the award was an-
nounced, the 77-year-old
economist said he had given up
hope of ever winning the prize,
which was established 20 years

(ago. ”l’ve been mentioned so

many times before, I just didn’t
think I would get it,” he said from
hisapartment in a Paris suburb.

The poverty and unemploy-

 

ment Allais saw in the United
States, on a visit during the Great
Depression of the 1930s, turned
him to economics from the en-
gineering career for which he had
trained.

According to the citation, Allais
was honored ”for his pioneering
contributions to the theory of
markets and efficient utilization
of resources.”

His theories are expressed in
complicated mathematical for-
mulas. They form the basis for
sorting out the thousands of in-
dependent factors involved in
marketing goods and services:
How much should a train ticket
cost, for example, or what is the
right price for a kilowatt-hour of
electricity?

Panel calls for
better prenatal care

WASHINGTON (AP) ~— A fed-

WORLD BRIEFS

eral panel called Tuesday for
universal access to prenatal care
by American women as a way to
reduce the number of babies
born diseased and handicapped
— and save taxpayer dollars in
the process.

”The most basic problem is
that our nation has failed to give
adequate priority to the principle
that all pregnant women -— not
only the affluent —— should
receive prenatal, delivery and
postpartum services,” said Joyce
C. Lashof, chairwoman of the In-
stitute of Medicine study com-
mittee.

The panel's two-year survey
started out trying to determine
what type of outreach programs
would be most effective in
providing pregnant women with

But it soon concluded that the
problem ran deeper than women
not being aware of services avail-
able to them.

”Our central conclusion is that
outreach efforts are no match for
the pervasive barriers faced by
|ow—income women in trying to
secure adequate prenatal and
maternity-care services,” Lashof
said at a news conference where
the 254—page report was issued.

properly using public funds to

On the surface, the issue is
whether an anti-drug mailing by
incumbent Sen. Edward W. Hel-
frick, R-Northumberland, violates
a Senate rule prohibiting candi-
dates from mailing state—funded
newsletters to constituents within
60 days of an election. State Rep.
John Showers, a Union County
Democrat running against Hel-
frick for the 27th District seat,
held a news conference to say it
did.

By the time the event was over,
Democrats and Republicans ac-
cused each other of lying, Hel-
frick accused Showers of being
soft on drugs and the bitter back-
stage battle to control the
50—member Senate was in the
open.

Dukakis
fights
negative
Pa. image

By David Morris \
Associated Press Writer

HARRISBURG (AP) -
Democratic presidential nominee
Michael Dukakis will be in trou-
ble in Pennsylvania on Election
Day unless he starts fighting back
against negative campaigning by
Republican candidate George
Bush, Gov. Robert P. Casey said
Tuesday.

’’I told him, frankly, he had to
take his gloves off and hit Bush,”
Casey said during a meeting with
reporters outside his office.

The governor, who was ac-
cusedof running a negative cam-
paign when he was elected in
1986, said hewould not tolerate
Bush's attacks and he does not
think Dukakis should, either.

’’If anybody questioned my
patriotism, l’d knock his head off
in no uncertain terms,” Casey
said angrily. ’’I wouldn't be nice
about it.”

Casey said he first told Dukakis
he needed to pick up the pace in
Pennsylvania during a campaign
stop in Greensburg late last
month but has seen no evidence
the candidate listened.

He said Dukakis needs to talk
about jobs, the economy and the
environment.

He also said the Dukakis cam-
paign, which has been picketed
by pro-life advocates, needs to
spell out Bush’s change of heart
on abortion. In recent campaign
appearances, Bush has said he
opposes abortion while Dukakis
favors it.

”George Bush is a total phony
on the abortion issue," Casey
said. ”(He) was pro-choice until
at least 1980. I think that George
Bush is selling the pro-life advo-
cates a bill of goods on that issue.
It's unfortunate that George Bush
has been throwing sand in their
faces/’

Although there are nearly
600,000 more Democrats than
Republicans in the state, most
polls show the vice president
holding a narrow‘ lead over
Dukakis. '

Area school for the blind undergoes reconstruction

. By Lisa Broujos

Staff Writer

The Western Pennsylvania
School for Blind Children, not
only a school for blind people but
for those with multiple handicaps
as well, has undergone major
reconstruction during the past
year to accommodate its various
scholastic and residential needs.

”The building was old and real-
ly not accessible for the children
in wheelchairs,” said Dr. Janet Si-
mon, the director of the school.
The construction has modernized
and made totally accessible the
school buildings while adding
more dormitory and classroom
space.

The $11 million project is be-
ing funded by the Department of
Education in Harrisburg and by
various other contributors.

”We will be able to go all
through the campus without hav-
ing to go outside,” Simon said. Si-
mon received both her master's
degree and doctorate at the
University of Pittsburgh.

The Western Pennsylvania
School is one of two schools for
the blind in Pennsylvania. The
other is in Philadelphia. The
school was chartered to operate
in 1887, and its five acres were
donated by Mary Schenley.

The enrollment of children be-
tween the ages of two and 21 is

189, and the number of staff

members, including teachers,
therapists, nurses and child-care
workers, is 250. Most children re-
side at the school during the
week.

”Everybody goes home .on
weekends. That's part of the
school's philosophy, that we’re
really not an institution, we're a
school,” Simon said.

"Kids should go home and
spend time with their brothers
and sisters,” Simon said. She
stressed that even though the
children often have multiple han-
dicaps, they are ”just kids” and
are ”treated like normal kids.”

She said a number of the
teenagers went to the Michael
lackson concert and were ”iust as

thrilled as any other teenagers
would be.”

The teaching methods vary ac-
cording to the age groups and
their capabilities. Simon said the
kids like activities and objects
that they can relate to, such as
tangible and audible objects.

The children are grouped ac-
cording to similar abilities in
groups of eight, with a teacher
and two assistants.

”We have the philosophy that
every child can learn from every
other child, as well as learning
from the adults,” Simon said.

Prior to 1975, when the school
consisted primarily of blind stu-
dents, most graduates went on to
college and entered the competi-

1

tive work force. Simon said that
multiply handicapped graduates
do more assembly—line work.

”They are still productive,” but
they are usually not lawyers, so-
cial workers or clerical workers,
Simon said.

”Oakland has a very high con-
centration of blind people” be-
cause many of the graduates
familiar with the area remain
here. The Pittsburgh Blind Associ-
ation is on North Craig Street, and
Moorehead Towers, subsidized
housing for the blind, is located
on North Craig Street and Baum
Boulevard, Simon added.

”Blind people tend to network
together,” Simon explained.

Two children killed as West Bank conflict continues

By Eileen Alt Powell

Associated Press Writer

JERUSALEM (AP) ~ Israeli
troops firing plastic bullets killed
two Palestinians — a teen-ager
and a 5-year-old boy — and
wounded a U.S. journalist during
clashes Tuesday in the occupied
West Bank, Arab hospital officials
said.

~An army spokesman ‘confirmed
the deaths and said five people
had plastic bullet wounds, in-
cluding American photographer
Neal Cassidy, the first foreign
journalist shot in the 10-month
Palestinian uprising over Israeli
rule in the occupied lands.

Hospital officials said six peo-
ple were wounded.

The 5-year-old boy died after
he was hit with plastic bullets in
the chest, stomach and left hand
as he played in a schoolyard near
his home, according to officials at
Al Ittihad Hospital. .

The child, identified as Deyaa
Fayez, was shot‘ when Israeli
soldiers opened fire on a nearby
group of stone—throwing Palestin-
ians, Arab reporters said. The
reporters and hospital officials
spoke on condition ofanonymity.

Hospital officials identified the
second victim as Khaled Tbaileh,
14, of Nablus. Officials at St. John
Hospital said he was shot in the
chest with a plastic bullet in a se-
cond clash in Nablus, the West
Bank's largest city.

The deaths raised to 301 the

number of Palestinians killed
since Arabs launched the upris-
ing Dec. 8. Six Israelis also have
died.

Israel has occupied the territo-
ries since the I967 Middle East
war.

Cassidy, 37, of Oakland, Calif.,
was hit in the right leg while pho-
tographing a demonstration in the
Nablus market area.

The army spokesman had no
details on the child’s death but
said soldiers opened fire in the
market after demonstrators threw
stones and bottles. \

The spokesman, who cannot
be identified under military regu-
lations, said Cassidy was close to
the rioters and ”endangered him-
self” by being in the area, which

was closed to outsiders under
military orders.

Cassidy and five Palestinians
ranging in age from 16 to 23
were wounded, hospital officials
said. All suffered plastic bullet
wounds, they said.

Hospital officials have reported
six deaths by plastic bullets since
the army introduced their use in
August.

Cassidy was covering the Nab-
lus protest for Frontline, a bi-
weekly newspaper published in
Oakland. He also works for Im-
pact Visuals, a photo agency in
New York.

Officials at the Government
Press Office in Jerusalem said
they had no record of Cassidy be-
ing accredited to work in Israel.

Also Tuesday, the Supreme

Arab Kach movement is racist.
Kahane told reporters that he was
urging backers to boycott the
vote,

The court also ruled the
Progressive List for Peace, which
calls for a Palestinian state along-
side Israel, could compete in the
elections. The right—wing Likud
bloc had demanded the party's
ouster for allegedly seeking to
destroy |srae|’s Jewish character.

Voyager student participates in English pub chicanery

As I tried to grab the pint of
beer the bartender handed me,
Nigel, my partner in ”The Great
Three-Legged Bar Crawl,” began
to walk away.

MICHELE
QUINN

My leg, which was tied to his
by an old bra, was being pulled
away as the pint of beer tipped
precariously. Other bar crawl
participants laughed as one of
them grabbed the beer and
another grabbed Nigel — who by
our ninth bar was so drunk he
didn't know quite what was go-

.ing on.

Out of the 30 pubs in Durham,
England, we were determined to
drink one pint of beer (1 6 ounces)
at 12 of them. It would have been
much easier if we didn't have to
finish by closing time (which was
10:30 p.m.) and tie ourselves to
a partner as if we were in a
”three-legged relay.”

Using everything from old bras
to dirty socks, people had start-
ed to tie their legs together at the

’ University of Durham's St. Hild

and St. Bede bar which opened
early at 6:30 p.m. We had four
hours to drink 192 ounces of
been

While others tried to walk
around the tables and up the
stairs, usually tripping and yelling
at their partner to slow down, I
drank my-first pint trying not to

taste the bitter dark brown beer.
My partner, Nigel, who was an
”experienced bar crawl-
er,”chugged his beer within a
few minutes.

As soon as I finished, we were
off to the next bar, racing down
the cobblestone streets trying not
to fall as onlookers stopped and
laughed at us. Bar crawls are a
common occurence in Durham,
many of the university's clubs use
them as fund-raisers, so its
citizens are used to half—drunk
students running between pubs.

Nigel and I raced by the
Durham Cathedral on our way to
the fourth bar. As we crossed the
lawn, and passed the sign which
read ”Do not walk on the grass,”
I started to feel ill from the rate
of consumption. The worst part of
the crawl was yet to come as we
had to run to the college bars on

I ”the hill,” which was 15 minutes

away.

Nigel laughed and sang drink-
ing songs, trying to keep my
spirits up. He even gulped down
some of my beers so he didn't
have to wait for me.

The people who were at the
bars we visited watched as we
entered the room demanding
pints as fast as the bartender
could pour them.

I realized how entertaining we
must have looked as we teetered
through the door trying to out-

scream fellow crawlers’ beer ord-
ers. Some of the participants had
fallen and were covered with
mud or were sweaty and out of
breath from running.

By the tenth bar, Nigel’s eyes
were glazed and I was trying to
bribe others to drink my beer for

me. I even started to pour some
of the beer into empty glasses
which were left on the tables —
trying not to get caught by the
other crawlers.

I don’t really remember going
to the last two bars. The crowd
had slowly dissipated leaving

only a few expert crawlers chug-
ging the last few pints.

I left Nigel with the others as he
leaned against the bar spilling the
few remaining drops of his beer
onto his soaked shirt. I untied the
bra, held it tightly in my hand and
somehow made it home.

Burning of the flag is
not a criminal offense

The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case from Texas
where a man was arrested for setting a flag on fire in front
of City Hall, while other protesters chanted, ”America,
the red, white and blue,_we spiton you. _

There is a Texas law which prohibits defacing or damag-
ing the flag when the person doing so knows that the act
will ”seriously offend” people. Both of the policemen who
made the arrest said that they were offended.

The act of burning the American flag to express one’s
opinion is understandably offensive. However, a law such
as this is ridiculous and a clear violation of the First
Amendment. Assuming the flag was the man's property,
he was completely within his rights to act in the way he

did.

In a nutshell...

”She set her own little rule, and she broke her own lit-

own promise.”

I tle rule. I'm admitting for her that she basically broke her

A few days ago, I was sitting in
traffic downtown, when sudden-
ly, a police officer on a police
bike, his siren screaming bloody
murder, flew up the street on the
wrong side‘ of the road. The
officer stopped right next to me
and in front of a car that was
stopped on the side of the street
in front of the Pittsburgh Nation-
al Bank building. The officer
jumped off of the bike, ran up to
the car and proceeded to scream
like a crazy man at the man in the
car. The officer called this man a
few names and said a few things
that could not be printed in this
column, no matter how much I
begged my editor. The man in the
car, looking shocked out of his
mind, responded, ”Officer, I am
just waiting for my wife." The
officer continued to verbally
abuse this man, then proceeded
to write him a ticket.

At the downtown Arts Festival,
a street man was dancing, high
on cheap wine. An officer of the
law came over to him and told
him to sit down. The man kept on
dancing. The crowd protested as
the man was grabbed, thrown to

a street man, it is communist
news to me.

A couple of friends of mine
went to a bar to have a few drinks
after work. They weren't there
even five minutes before one of
them, a girl, asked the other, a
guy, if he would trade his sweat
shirt for her T-shirt. They went to
the bathroom to switch. Three
off-duty police officers suspected
them of drug use and followed

[...] It seems that for some
odd reason Mr. Young feels
that homosexuals don’t have
the right to protection under
the law.

Obviously, Mr. Young is not
gay, and equally as obvious,
he knows nothing about gay
people. He states, ”Homosex—
uality, however, is not normal
or acceptable, it is something
that participants willfully
choose for reasons of their
own.”... Why, when so many
share the small—mindedness
that you apparently possess,
would someone choose to be‘
gay? It would be like choosing
to be black during times of
slavery. Although many black
people were undoubtedly
proud and accepting of what
they were, the world of the
white man was quite better.
The same thing holds true be-
tween straights and gays in our

gay people stay in the closet.

”Lions, tigers and bears do
not practice homosexuality.”
Maybe not, but gorillas and

society. No wonder so many‘

apes, of which, theoretically,
humans are direct descen-

ality. It has been observed
thousands of times and
documented. Fortunately, in
the ape world, there are no so-
cial ramifications for being
gay. Unfortunately for the
straight and gay members of
Pittsburgh, we have Pittsburgh
City Council. Or maybe, I
should have said half of City
Council, considering the other
half voted in favor of the legis-
lation. [...]

An offended non-smoker

I am a sophomore here at
Pitt and a slightly offended
non-smoker. [...] Mr. Ross,
have you ever smelled the hair
or the clothes of a girl who
smoked? Have you ever kissed
one for that matter? Well,
maybe you smokers are used
to such aromas and delicacies.
Not me, thanks. [...]

Also, the halls of the
Cathedral aren't as large as
you ”think.” Along with the
smoke saturating your clothes .
and hair, it also dissipates into
a large volume. I won't go into
the expansion rate, that's not
the point, and this isn't Chem
II, but the smoke is nonethe-
less bothersome. [...]

Finally, smoking doesn't
look ”hip." This is the '80s.
Hip, to me, means road signs
on your walls, classic tracks 
and accepting ”no” as an an-
swer from a date. [...]

them in. The officers grabbed and
frisked them. Finding no drugs on
them, the officers let them go.
Upset, and planning to file a
complaint, they approached the
officers. Even though they were
off duty and consuming alcohol,
these cops decided that they
would arrest my friends. The
officers grabbed them, slammed
them against the wall and took
them in. My one friend sat in de-
tox -for seven hours that night,
and my other friend showed me
deep scratches all over her neck
that one officer gave her during
this brutal arrest.

If you take the time to look at
the side of a police car you will
see the logo ”To serve and pro-
tect.” If this is what these officers’
ideas are of serving and protect-
ing, then they have no right to be
on the police force.

I have asked many students
here at the University of Pitts-
burgh to tell me their definition
of the responsibilities of being a
police ofﬁcer. The definitions I
have heard. so far have been very
fierce. The definitions have
ranged from "to be fat and vi-

cious” to ”to think you are
Charles Bronson or Clint East-
wood while clearing the shelves
of Mr. Donut.” Surprisingly, no-
where in between these two defi-
nitions is one that includes ”to
serve and protect.”

Along with the comically deri-
sive things that students have
created are some of the testimo-
nies of students about the exces-
sive amount of force that some of
the officers are using. Jeff Mernic,
a sophomore at Pitt, told me
about the time he was arrested
while fighting with his girlfriend.
”We were arguing pretty badly,
and I grabbed her jacket. About
a second later, two or three of
them [police officers] grabbed
me, threw me and cuffed me."

Sharon Ingrassia, a Pitt senior,
has witnessed many examples of
excessive force. ”They [police
officers] will literally slam you
against a wall or literally throw
you in the paddy wagon, no mat-
ter what the cause for arrest is.”

One of my friends from class
told me about a time that he wit-
nessed a police officer grab the
arm of someone sitting on the

What ever happened to ”To serve and protect”?

wall across from The Original.
’’All the guy did was resist a little
when the officer grabbed his arm,
and the guy was cuffed and
tossed into the paddy wagon.”
An officer commented on these

instances by saying, ”We have P

had a lot of rookies here [in Oak-
land], and some of them are a lit-
tle anxious.”

Rookie or not, should officers
in Oakland and elsewhere be so
aggressive with citizens? Are they
this aggressive with serious
thieves? Do they know the differ-
ence between a serious thief and
an innocent citizen?

Let me make it clear that I am
not overlooking all of the good,
honest, caring and fair police
officers in this city. They know
who they are. I would also like
to comment that I have never wit-
nessed or heard of an instance
where a university officer was in-
volved  except for the time that
I got a ticket for not studying. But
some of these Robocop wanna-
bees should just relax a teeny bit.

The Lady Panthers dominat-
ed an overmatched Robert
Morris team in volleyball ac-

\ tion at Fitzgerald Field House
last night.

Despite frequent substitu-
tions, Pitt had little problem in
capturing three straight games
(l5-6, l5-2 and 15-6) from
their cross—town rivals.

The win raised the Lady
Panthers’ record to 15-5;
Robert Morris dropped to
6-10. ’

ln game one, junior Julie
Sheils’ top-spin serve befud-
dled the opposition.

Taking over the serve with
the score knotted at three,
Sheils proceeded to ace
Robert Morris four straight
times and turn the game into
a rout. F

Shells and All-American

_ candidate senior Denise

Frawley paced the Pitt artillery

against hapless Robert Morris

in game one with four and
three kills, respectively.

Pitt's domination of Robert
Morris was even more deci-
sive in game two. Paced by
middle-blockers senior Nora
Mulvihill and freshman Dee
MacAulay’s three kills, the
Lady Panthers. ran off to a 13-0
lead before mercifully granting
Robert Morris their two points
for the game.

Despite wholesale substitu-
tions in game three, Pitt put
the finishing touches on the
sweep of Robert Morris with a
15-6 win.

Freshman Sue Zonneville,
who had entered the match in
the second game, gave the
Lady Panthers a strong perfor-
mance in the middle. She tal-
lied three kills in game three

 

as well as a team—leading five
for the match.

Pitt coach Shelton Collier
was pleased about the Lady

Panthers’ win on a number of \

fronts.

”The game was most impor-
tant because we wanted to
play well in the field house to
get ready for our next home
match against Penn State [Oct.
29]. We wanted to go into the

Penn State match in a positive
frame of mind,” he noted.

Another positive aspect of
the match according to Colli-
er: ”We were able to play a lot
of people that haven't had an
opportunity to play much.”

With the win, the Lady Pan-
thers’ record advances to 15-5.

  Injury bug takes bite out of Pitt,

forced to use inexperience on line

By Matt Martin

Sports Editor

The Pitt Panthers, a Top 20
team just four weeks ago after
demolishing Ohio State, have
completed their transformation to
the walking wounded.

A 42-7 win over Temple this
past weekend broke the Panthers’
three game losing streak and
evened their record at 3-3, but in-
juries sustained in the game may
also have broken their collective
back.

Offensive tackle Tom Ricketts,
guard Chris Goetz, reserve Bill
Cherpak and center Dean
Caliguire all suffered injuries on

the front line, and Ricketts, who‘
is in a cast, will not play this‘

weekend in the Homecoming
matchup with Navy. Cherpak
and Goetz have been assigned to
second team positions for the
game.

Add to that defensive end Burt
Grossman’s gimpy ankle, tailback
Adam Walker's injured Achilles
tendon, arthroscopic surgery to
defensive tackle Marc Spind|er's
knee, cornerback Cornell Hollo-
way’s cervical sprain and quarter-

back Larry Wanke’s lame
shoulder, and you have a team
even younger than Pitt coach
Mike Gottfried could have im-
agined at the onset of the season.

’’I’m very concerned about the
injury situation,” Gottfried said.
”The one tough thing with inju-
ries is that you don’t get any con-
tinuity and consistency each
week.”

Cherpak agreed.

”Experience is a big thing in
college football. Our offensive
line played against Navy last
year, so we know what types of
things they do. The younger guys
haven't learned that yet.”

But Cherpak is confident that
the underclassmen — particular-
ly those on the offensive line —
can handle the pressure.

”The young guys are stepping
up to the challenge,” he said, not-
ing Scott Miller, who will start for
Ricketts at left tackle, in par-
ticular.

”He played for Ricketts most of
the game. It was his first game at
Pitt that he really played in. This
week in practice, he knows that
he will be the starter."

Cherpak," who would have

started at left tackle, was injured
against the Owls when guard
Mark Stepnoski blocked his man
onto Cherpak’s leg.

”l’m day to day,” he said.

Freshman guard Dave‘ Dixon
will start in place of Goetz, and
John Glesky, who has played at
center and guard, will back up
Caliguire. 1

Gottfried spotted one positive
note in the injury situation.

”The one thing you can’t meas-
ure on this football team right
now is the experience that the
younger people are gaining in
good situations, positive situ-
ations.

”l was very impressed with the
number of people playing that
are going to be around here for
awhile,” Gottfried said, referring
to his freshmen defensive line-
men in particular -— tackles
Richard Allen and Jeff Esters, and
ends Nelson Walker and Mike
Chalenski.

Gottfried noted that some of
the injured players may see play-
ing time this week.

"Cherpak, Goetz and Caliguire
all are kind of gimpy and we

Bills already thinking about playoff drive

By Barry Wilner

AP Sports Writer

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. —
After their smashing return to the
NFL limelight, the Buffalo Bills
might be ready for anything. Even
their first trip to the Super Bowl.

The Bills routed the injury-
plagued New York Jets 37-14
Monday night in their first ap-
pearance on the league’s weekly

showcase in four years. Their
fourth-straight victory within the
AFC East gave the Bills a 6-1
record, tied with Cincinnati for
the best mark in the conference.
They have a two—game lead on
Miami in the division.

”This sure puts us in the
driver's seat,” Jim Kelly said af-
ter throwing for 302 yards and
three touchdowns. ”We’ve
played all four teams, and we’ve
beaten all four teams. They have

to be thinking we're the team to
beat.”

With their next two games at
home against New England and
Green Bay, the Bills are in excel-
lent position to keep that lead or
build on it. But they also play five
of their last seven games on the
road, including trips to Miami,
Seattle and Cincinnati.

The Bills have not made the
playoffs since 1981. After seven
weeks, they aren't talking about

’’I think this is a playoff—qua|ity
team,” said A|l—Pro defensive end
Bruce Smith, who had 2‘/2 of
Buffalo's five sacks of Ken
O'Brien. ”But we still have to
prove that.”

It was Smith's best outing since
returning from a 30-day suspen-
sion for substance abuse.

”This game should show a lot
of people how strong we are.”

And how weak the Jets are
when they are undermanned. Af-
ter a 3-1 start, the Jets are O-2—1.
They played Monday without
tight end Mickey Shuler, who
was tied with the Bills’ Andre

Reed for the AFC receiving lead
but idled by a neck injury; left
tackle Dave Cadigan, the No. 1
draft choice who was placed on
injured reserve with a damaged
ankle; and their best linebacker,
Alex Gordon, out with a thigh
problem.

Then they lost guard Ted
Banker for at least three weeks
with a sprained foot.

”These things do happen,”
O'Brien said. ”But we have to
fight through it.

.Pitt soccer team hopes
to get back on winning
track against Colonials

By Mike Rampa
‘Staff Writer

The soccer team is gearing up
for tonight's match against the
Robert Morris Colonials. Coach
Joe Luxbacher hopes to bring his
team back to the .500 mark for
the season with a victory.

”We’re going to have our
hands full. They're a very talent-
ed team,” Luxbacher said.
”Robert Morris is mostly an all-
foreign team. Most of the players
are from Trinidad. I'm expecting
a tough game.”

. The Colonials beat the Panthers
at Robert Morris in a close game
last season by a score of 1-0.

Pitt hopes its developing
offense, which has shown im-
pressive progress and patience
during the course of the last
several games, will start showing
some results on’the scoreboard.

Midfielder Heinz Pak is the
Panthers’ leading scorer and most
O-dangerous offensive threat. Mark
Mostinckx has come into his own
lately, complementing Pak’s scor-
ing with two assists.

Luxbacher plans to keep
Mostinckx in the midfield to per-
form his role as the stabilizing
agent of the occasionally impa-
tient offensive line.

Pak, however, could wind up

anywhere on the field. ”Heinz
can do the job anywhere. If we
have to bring him back [on
‘defense] to allow a few other
guys to create some scoring op-
portunities, then I’m prepared to
do that,” Luxbacher said.

Jay Kapusta, who had outstand-
ing games against Georgetown
and Carnegie Mellon, will most
likely get the start in goal. Assis-
tant Coach Bob Campbell feels
that Kapusta has demonstrated
the skills to earn him the starting
spot. In addition to some key
saves, Kapusta consistently kicks
60- yard punts down to about the
opponents 35- or 40- yard line.
This takes some pressure off of
the offensive line as they simply
set up around the 40 instead of
touch passing or playing kick-
and—run to get the ball downfield.

Scott rMcCurry has played ex-
ceptionally well, most notably at
the CMU game. He will be an in-
tegral element in the Panthers’
defensive scheme tonight.

‘Pitt has played defense out-
standingly all season, and sweep-
er.Dan Liberati and stopper Jon
Ascher will have their hands full
for yet another game trying to
shut down the Colonials’ effec-
tive offense.

The action gets underway at
:15 p.m. tonight in the stadium.

Paterno not worried about Lions’ '88 record

By David S. Martin

Associated Press Writer

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — Coach
Joe Paterno said Tuesday he
would rather see Penn State im-
prove than add to the school's
record 49-year string of non-
losing seasons.

"I don't really give a darn about
the non-losing season streak. I
don't even think about it," Pater-
no said. '’I'm thinking about how
we're going to get to be a decent
football team.”

Penn State, 4-2, lost 24-10 to
Syracuse Saturday and finishes
the season against Alabama, No.
6 West Virginia, Maryland, Pitt
and No. 2 Notre Dame.

’'I would think we're probably
going to be underdogs in five of
the last five games,” Paterno said
at his weekly news conference.

season came in 1938 under
Coach Bob Higgins when they
finished 3-4-1. The 49-year string
stands as an NCAA_record.

Paterno’s worst season as head
coach was his first, in 1966,
when Penn State finished 5-5.

In his 23-year tenure, Paterno
has amassed a 211-50-2 record,
including 19 bowl appearances
and national championships in
1982 and 1986.

"I'm concerned with whether
we can get this club good enough
that they can be a competitive
football team  and get over the
kind of football we've played
lately," Paterno said.

He said he would start tailback
Leroy Thompson Saturday at
Alabama, 4-1, in front of the
sophomore’s "hometown”
crowd. ,

Brown at tailback this season.

Thompson, who hails from
Knoxville, Tenn., has rushed for
194 yards on 56 carries this
season.

Brown is the team's leading
rusher with 400 yards on 68 car-
ries, while Redman has 171 yards
on 29 carries.

Against Syracuse, Paterno fault-
ed the team's pass coverage, pass
rush, the offensive line for five
illegal procedure calls, the
receivers for their inability to
catch the ball, the kicking game
and the punt returners for allow-
ing the ball to bounce.

"I'm still very optimistic about
this squad. I'm disappointed
we've lost two games. Disap-
pointed but not discouraged,”
Paterno said.

”We've got to now understand
what it takes to win. Not just to
play hard, but to win. I don't

think we played Saturday the way
you play when you expect to
win. That's my job to do, obvi-
ously,” he added.

Freshman quarterback Tony
Sacca seemed one of the few
players immune from the coach's
criticism Tuesday.

"Sacca has done well,” Pater-
no said. "His performance had
nothing to do with the fact that
we got beaten by Syracuse.”

Sacca came in for Tom Bill late
in the third quarter of Penn State's
21-16 loss to Rutgers Sept. 24.

Sacca, the first true freshman to
start at quarterback under Pater-
no, started in wins against Tem-
ple and Cincinnati before the
Syracuse loss.

He has completed 39 of 90
passes for 624 yards, two inter-
ceptions and four touchdowns.

"I don't think you can blame
the fact that Tommy Bill got hurt

on all our problems. Since Tom-
my Bill has gotten hurt, we've
won two games, and I thought
Sacca played a good strong game
against Syracuse except for the
fact that he took some sacks, par-
ticularly one early in the game,"
Paterno said.

"You're going to get bad plays
no matter who's playing quarter-
back," he added.

Sacca was sacked five ‘times for
a total of 46 yards, including a
sack for a 15-yard loss on the
Lions’ first possession.

Paterno said he has not thought
about whom he will play at quar-
terback when Bill recovers from
a dislocated kneecap. ‘

''l have not even given that one
single bit of thought," Paterno
said.

Bill is expected to begin prac-
ticing the week of the West Vir-
ginia game, Oct. 29.

.Tight end Kirk becoming a bigger
part of Panther offensive scheme

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, October I9, I988

By Vince Carey
Sports Editor

The Pitt offense has gotten

‘away from the run a little bit. The

last two games, quarterback Dar-
nell Dickerson has thrown for
209 yards against Notre Dame
and 287 yards against Temple —~
both career bests.

The ground game is still a big
part of the offensive scheme
(averaging 253.2 yards per
game), but the passing game is
starting to assert itself. One play-
er who should benefit from this
is tight end Vernon Kirk.

Against Temple last week, Kirk
was used in a goal line play in
which he received a pitch from
Dickerson and ran around the
end. The play worked twice (from
one yard and two yards out) for
touchdowns.

”We ran the same play against
Northern Iowa,’’ Kirk said. ”Dar—
nell has the option of flipping the
ball or keeping it. Against North-
ern Iowa, we kept it. Against
Temple, he read the safety and
pitched it to me, and I ran it in.”

Kirk feels that the offense has

”We have shaped up pretty ‘

be getting better as the season
moves along.”

Kirk hails from Donora, Pa.,
and played for Ringgold High
School. He received many
honors during his high school
career, including All-State and
Washington County's Defensive
Player of the Year. He was also
named to the UPI Top 25.

So far this season, Kirk has
caught just four passes for 40
yards but has been used more re-
cently.

”It is something we put in at
camp,” Kirk said. ”The coaches
wanted to utilize the tight end a
little more this year. We showed
that we [tight ends Tom Huebner,
Dave Tanczos and Kirk] could all
catch the ball during the spring,
and it just carried over into the
fall.”

Panther coach Mike Gottfried
has seen Kirk improve over the
course of hiscareer at Pitt and
hopes to use him more often.

”We have always had it [plays
to the tight end] built in there; it
isjust that we are throwingafew
more bootleg passes now and a
couple of different things,” Gott-
fried said. “’Vernon has been
productive when we have called
on him.”

The last couple of weeks, the
Pitt offensive line has been hit

, Oakland starter Ste wart looks for

better tidings on mound tonight

By Jim Donaghy
AP_ Baseball Writer

OAKLAND, Calif. — Dave
Stewart hopes the country is

Qwatching him in Game 4 of the

World Series. He has something
to prove.

Stewart started Game 1 for
Oakland and got a no decision
when Kirk Gibson pinch hit a
two-run homer in the bottom of
the ninth off Dennis Eckersley to
give Los Angeles a 5-4 victory.

Stewart gets another chance
Wednesday night and is expect-
ed to be opposed by Dodgers
rookie Tim Belcher. Los Angeles
carried a 2-0 lead into the best-
of-seven series Tuesday.

Q‘ Stewart, who pitched his first

three seasons for the Dodgers,
was hoping to get some recogni-
tion from a victory in the World
Series. Two consecutive 20-game
seasons haven't been good
enough.

’’I was a 20—game winner last
year and I was left off 12 Cy
Young ballots. That's a shame,”
Stewart said. ”The reporters that
cover the A's rspect my ability
and show that in the way they
write about me and my ability. I
wasn't very happy about it last
year.”

Stewart had reason to be un-
happy after Game 1 but he didn’t
show it.

”Our record speaks for itself,”
Stewart said. ”We know we're
good. I've got no reason to think

we’re not going to make a run at
this thing.”

Stewart pitched eight innings in
Game 1 and allowed three runs
and six hits. He struck out five
and walked two.

”The thing I wanted to do is
just what I did — I kept us close
and gave us a chance to win,”
Stewart said. ”I can't ask for too
much more than that.”

Stewart was 20-13 in 1987 and
21-12 this year. Not a bad record
for a guy who was released by
Philadelphia in 1986.

Belcher also started Game 1
and had all kinds of trouble.

In two innings, he allowed
three hits and four runs while
walking four. The big hit was Jose
Canseco’s grand slam in the se-
cond inning.

’’I was keyed up and anxious,
and usually I walk behind the
mound and relax,” Belcher said.
”But on Saturday I stayed right on
the mound, got the ball and toed
the rubber.

”I started thinking ’I can't walk
him (Canseco), or ‘I can't hang a
slider to him.’ I tried too much
I just went crazy.”

Belcher won nine of his last 11
games to finish 12-6 and won
two games in the National
League playoffs against the Mets.

He throws heat, in excess of 92
mph, but his control got him in
trouble on Saturday.

Steroids almost caused ex-South
Carolina player to commit suicide

NEW YORK (AP) — Former
South Carolina football player
Tommy Chaikin used bodybuild-
ing anabolic steroids for three
years and says they drove him to
violence and nearly to suicide be-
fore last year's Clemson game,
according to this week's issue of
Sports Illustrated.‘

”I was sitting in my room at the
Roost, the athletic dorm at the
University of_ South Carolina,
with the barrel of a loaded .357
Magnum pressed under my
chin,” the story, written by Chai-
kin and 5/’s Rick Telander,
begins.

”My finger twitched on the trig-
ger. I was in bad shape, very bad
shape. From the steroids._ It had
all come down from the steroids,
the crap I'd taken to get big and
strong and aggressive so I could
play this game that I love.”

Chaikin said he had been hav-
ing ”anxiety attacks” for five
months and said they had be-
come ”so intense that I couldn't
stand them anymore. I'd lost con-
trol of everything. ...”

”I was definitely going crazy,
but not in a wild way.  I knew
I was history — it was just a mat-
ter of time. I thought about the ex-
plosion and the bullet, about how
it could take away this pain.”

Chaikin, a 6-foot-1, 250-pound.

defensive lineman from Bethes-
da,, Md., lettered in from 1984-7
after redshirting in 1983. He said
he didn't pull the trigger because
his father, who had flown to
Columbia-,: S.C., for the game,
knockedon the door and‘ took
him to Sibley Memorial Hospital

In the waiting room, Chaikin
said he ”started to have spasms.

My body was having a reaction
to Stelazine, the drug that a psy-
chiatrist had prescribed for me a
few weeks earlier when I'd first
come home from South Carolina
to get some professional help.”

Chaikin said that ”suicide was
always on my mind. Suicide and
football.”

Coach ]oe Morrison, who took
over the South Carolina program
in 1983, refused to comment on
the story. ”Coach Joe Morrison
does not plan to have any com-
ment on the story tonight,” sports
information director Kerry “Tharp
said. I
Chaikin weighed 185 when he
first played football as a junior in
high school. He said he built him-
self up to 200 pounds as a senior
by lifting weights.

As a freshman at South Caroli-
na, he ”held a dummy for the
scout team and got knocked
around all fall.  Already guys
had asked me if I wanted to take
steroids — they called the stuff
”juice” — so I could beefup and

fight back."

In the spring of 1984, Chaikin
said, ”I decided I was going to
take steroids to get big and strong
and aggressive. I finally broke
down  I saw how well the guys
already on steroids were doing,
maybe 30 of them at that time.”

He said assistant coach Jim
Washburn told him, ”Do what
you have to do, take what you
have to take.”

Chaikin said he went from 210

‘pounds to 235 in eight weeks,

taking 12 injections a month. In
addition to muscle growth, he
said he ”got real bad acne on my
back; my hair started to come
out. I was having trouble sleep-
ing, and my testicles began to
shrink — all the side effects you
hear about.”

When he took his football
physical that fall, a doctor told
him he had developed high
blood pressure and a heart mur-
mur. But Chaikin said he ”never
heard a word about it from the
coaches.”

sacks of quarterback Randall
Cunningham.

"They beat us on offense,
defense, special teams and ev-
eything else,” said Ryan,
whose team slipped to 3-4.

’’It was a lack of execution.
I thought we had a pretty good
game plan on both sides of the
ball,” he said.

”We had enough sacks for
everybody to take credit,” he
said of the pass protection.

”I don't think anybody
played a great game,” he ob-
served, although offensive
tackle Matt Darwin, defensive
tackle Mike Pitts, and special
teamers Terry Hoage and
Dave Little were named as
players of the game for the
losers.

”We got beat physically a
few times, but mostly there
were mental areas where cer-
tain things happened that
shouldn’t have happened. It
wasn’t always the offensive
line or the backs. Everybody
shared in it. 4

”When you do things like
that you’re going to get it
handed-to you.”

Ryan was unable to reason
why the Eagles were so high
in beating the New York Gi-
ants on Monday Night Foot-
ball a week ago, and so flat
against the Browns.

”|’ve coached high school,
college and in the pros, and it
happens at all levels. |t’s noth-
ing you want to happen but it
does.

’’I hope we all learned that
with a short week you have to
get ready [quickly]. Nobody
made the plays needed to
win.”

Ryan noted, ”When things
are going bad they have a way
of snowballing into a lot of
problems. We struggled on
both sides of the ball.

"We needed turnovers ear-
ly, somebody to make a play
that would change the field
position. We couldn't get it
done. We had about four
chances and got one.”

aFlorida State feels they are a victim poll apathy Kirk

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, October I9, I988

By Brent Kallestad
Associated Press Writer
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Because
Florida State slipped a voter's
mind, the Seminoles slipped from
fifth to seventh in the weekly As-
sociated Press football poll, and
that created a small furor in the

3 state Tuesday.

P o
III-I-II-i-I-III--I-I

After a 45-21 victory over East
Carolina on Saturday, Florida
State fell from fifth to seventh, be-
hind Nebraska and undefeated
West Virginia. Nebraska, 6-T,
moved from seventh to fifth after
defeating No. 10 Oklahoma State
62-42. West Virginia, 6-0, was
idle and remained No. 6.

”This is unbelievable,” said
Wayne Hogan, sports informa-
tion director at Florida State.
”We’ve won six straight ball
games.  West Virginia moves in
front of us, and they didn't play.’’

AP College Football Editor Her-
schel Nissenson, who conducts
the weekly poll, said one of the
60 sports writers and sport-
scasters who vote failed to list
Florida State in the Top 20.

The voter, not identified under
poll guidelines, said he probably
would have voted the Seminoles
seventh, enough to keep them
No. 5 in the final tabulation.

’’It was an oversight on the part

of the voter and an oversight on
our part for not double-
checking,” AP Sports Editor Dar-

rell Christian said Tuesday. ’’We 6

try to ensure it's honest, of
course, and as accurate as such
an unscientific survey can be.”
The Seminoles have rolled up
six straight wins after losing 31-0
at Miami in their season opener.
”We haven't been impressive
the last three weeks, but I was
surprised we dropped two places
after winning,” Florida State
coach Bobby Bowden said Tues-
day during his weekly telephone
conference call with reporters.
’’If the reason we dropped is

that somebody didn't vote us in
the Top 20, I'd think that would
take care of itself if it is correct-
ed,” he added. .

Christian said this week’s pol
would stand, adding, ”lt’s unfor-
tunate, but it probably will recti-
fy itself next week.”

Hogan said, however, that the
error could perpetuate itself be-
cause voters often work off the
previous week’s poll table. Once
listed as No. 7, the Seminoles are
likely to remain No. 7 unless a
higher-ranked team is upset, he
said, and that could keep Florida
State from being invited to one of
the major postseason bowl

games.

playing four straight home games,
the Panthers have to go on the
road to finish out the season.

Since the end of the college
football season is more important
for bowl game recognition than
the beginning, it has the potential
to hurt a team. Kirk doesn't fol-
low that line.

’’I don't think it is much of a
problem,” Kirk said. ’’People
think that when a team gets used
to their home crowd, it becomes
a problem when they go on the
road. I don't believe that. We
have a good enough team that it
shouldn't affect us.”
