Concentrating on finding

Clever condom comebacks for students

EXCUSES! EXCUSES!

. According to the Pennsylvania Bureau‘
of HIV/AIDS and Department
of Education, the average age for teens
to have intercourse for the first time
is 15.5 for boys and 16 forgirls. A
survey by “Seventeen,” November, 1991
revealed that 51 percent of 14-2 year olds
are engaging in sex. A Student Health sur-

’ vey in 1989 found that 67 percent of

undergraduates and 92 percent of graduate

. students have had intercourse. The

researchers found that between 80 and 89
percent do not use condoms for disease
prevention.

 “It doesn’t feel good.”

“It takes too long.”

“You won’t catch anything from me.”

Do any of these excuses click? They are
all excuses for not using a condom.

The health profession has promoted con-
dom use since the increase of STDs (sexu-
ally transmitted diseases) and the specter
of HIV. Is anyone out there listening? We
think not:

In an attempt to find out why condoms
are not being used, we can refer to
the above excuses. Men complain that
there is a diminution in ‘sensation, it inter-
feres with the spontaneity of lovemaking, it
takes too long to put one on and it negates
the trusting relationship necessary for inti-

macy.

Many women find it hard to combat
these very valid sounding reasons for not
using condoms. The bottom line, however,

makes the excuses sound weak. Women,‘

most often, are losers in this game,
although everyone ultimately loses. Most

 

CARTER

STDs can cause serious problems if

untreated: sterility, pelvic inﬂammatory dis— .

ease and even death. Many are insidious
They exhibit mild or no symptoms until
well advanced.

But then - everyone knows these facts.
Do they use condoms? NO.

Asking your partner to use a condom
when he throws up such roadblock takes
Chutzpah.

Brown University’s Office of Health
Services took a survey of students to

explore some condom comebacks. It was
felt that if women were given some ready-
made replies totheir partners’s excuses, it
might help them over come their reticence
and tirnidity.

Here are some of the replies to:

“It doesn’t feel good.”

“If you are uncomfortable with using
condoms, then let’s try something other
than intercourse.”

“Aw, come on, I love- the feel of rubber.”

“It spoils the mood.”

-“Just think how much fun it will be start-
ing all over again with it on.”

“So does getting AIDS.”

“It takes too long.”

“Then you need practice and there’s no
time like the present.”

“Arguing about it takes longer.”-

“You won’t catch anything from me.”

“Yes, but I might catch something from
the last person you slept with.”

“Have you been tested lately?”

“Just this once won’t matter.”

“It only takes once.”

“Oh? If it doesn’t matter, then let’s go
watch a movie instead.”

Now that you have ammunition for con-
dom excuses — use them, already!

For The Pitt News

Honoring the Pitt-West
Virginia football rivalry, Pitt’s
.Alpha Phi Omega National
Co—ed Service Fraternity is co-
sponsoring a run from WVU
to Pitt in which all proceeds
will beneﬁt the Autism Society
of America.
The event Kicks off with a
ceremonial hand-off of the

WVU head coach Don Nehlen
to the first runner.

The hand—off will take place
at 8 a.m. Friday morning at
Mountaineer
Morgantown, W.V.
Approximately 50 different
runners will take turns carry-
ing the ball 80 miles along
Route 19 into Pittsburgh.

West Virginia coordinator
Andy Kirk says the runners
hope to arrive in Pittsburgh
around 8 p.m. Friday night.

official game ball from the

Stadium in’

“We’re working on setting
up banners and posters
along the route to cheer on
the runners,” Kirk said.

"‘We’re still not sure what
we’re going to do when we
come to the Liberty Tunnels
though.”

One Pitt student who par-

ticipated in the run last year,

Jenny McBride, said,

“The run is a lot of fun. .

You get to meet a lot of dif-
ferent people from both Pitt
and WVU, and it benefits a
great cause.”

This is the 21st year of the
run. The Pitt chapter will co-
sponsor the, run along. with
the Alpha Phi Omega chapter
at WVU. ' ..

Inaddition to the run itself,
Alpha Phi Omega is sponsor-
ing numerous other events
this week at both Pitt and
WVU. Members of the WVU
chapter are taking part in a
pass-a-thon.

“A lot of people don’t want
to miss their Friday classes
and therefore can’t run, but

. still want to help out,” said

Kirk.

“The pass-a-thon will take
place in front of the student
union at WVU. Members will
take turns passing a symbolic
football back and forth while
the run is going on.”

Both chapters are collecting
funds through pledges made
to the runners and through
canning. '

The runners plan to present
the game ball to Pitt head

coach Paul Hackett during a

pre-game ceremony on
Saturday at Pitt Stadium
according to Pitt coordinator
Trish Will.

The charity was brought
to the attention of Alpha
Phi Omega by the president
of the Pittsburgh chapter of
the Autism Society of
America, Dan Torisky.

Alpha Phi Omega sponsors beneﬁt run

Torisky’s son, who is afflicted
with autism, was the role
model for Dustin Hoffman’s
character in the movie
Rainmcm.

“Most people don’t know
any more about autism than
what they saw in Raz'nman,”

~ Kirk said. “Autism is a rare

disability. We want to help

_ fund research and fight the

disease.”

-“We are generally trying to.

raise awareness of the disease
with this event,” Will said.

_“The more infonned people
are, the better prepared we’ll
be to fight autism.”

The chapters hope to raise
a combined total of $3,000 or
more.

“We do a lot of projects but
this run is our biggest,” Kirk
said. ~

“We hope the communities
of Morgantown and
Pittsburgh can help us to
reach our goals.”

SGB obtains passes
fromthe Carnegie

By Carmen M. McGi]1
Staff Writer

Pitt students will be able
to explore the art exhibits,
hall of dinosaurs and Oasis
of Egypt at the Carnegie
Museum all for free this year
due to the Student
Government Board’s pur-
chase of passes.

Just as last year, the SGB
bought 3,700 passes and is
making them available to all
CAS students.

“[Last year’s program] was
very successful, especially
for a first year program. We
gave out _,all the passes we
had,” SGB President Gil
Golden said. “Typically, stu-
dents who went once went
again and again.”

Last year, the Carnegie
presented the SGB with lit-
erature and ideas about-pur-
chasing passes for under-
graduate students.

“Every board member had
been to the Carnegie but felt
that it was expensive,” SGB
President Gil Golden said.

“[Wel looked at’ [their pro--

posall and negotiated a
price.”

Last year about 200 passes
were given as a gift to CGS
so they could also see if
their students were interest-
ed in the Carnegie, accord-
ing to Golden.

This year SGB bought the
Carnegie passes earlier.
They bought the same num-.
ber of passes at the same
price and sold 150 to CGS
for their original price. SGB
also gave passes to the art
department and is ‘consider-
ing giving passes to the biol-
ogy department for students
taking Biology 006.

The Carnegie and
appointed SGB undergradu—
ates have a committee that
comes up with programs for
undergraduate students. “We
take suggestions from
undergrads and funnel them

to the Carnegie,” Golden

said.
CAS students may obtain
free passes to the Carnegie

‘by stopping by the SGB

office located in 639 William
Pitt Union.

Protesting the Department of

peace activist group, “Desert

day at Carnegie Mellon.

“We should lay war-making
aside and devote resources to
more humanitarian research
projects. We can’t even feed
people in Somalia or right
here,” activist Vincent Eirene
said.

After the speech, the group
walked to Warner Hall carrying
a banner reading “BREAD NOT

According to Eirene, the
group was going to make a
presentation to CM President
Robert Mehrabian. The items
for presentation were a loaf of

Virtual reality demonstrated in Union

By Christine Hanna
Asst. News Editor

,Two people play against each other
with the objective of killing one another.
There will be no actual deaths, only
bursts of particles on the monitors. The
players get into the pod, place the hel-
mets on their heads and buckle the
equipment. Then they simply look
through the helmet to find their oppo-
nent in the multi-level complex, aim and
fire. .

For three and a half minutes they turn
in circles, move their heads up and
down, and fire the joystick. Whatever
they say is amplified so the spectators
can hear. '

Innovative technology hascome to
the University of Pittsburgh through the
game “Virtuality,” created by Virtual
Reality Productions. Virtuality, spon-

sored by Pitt Program Council and
Pepsi-Cola, attracted many students’
attention as they walked through the
William Pitt Union Concourse
Wednesday.

“I thought it was great. It was really
neat,” first-year student Matt Wapner
said.

“What the computer does is simulate-

an artiﬁcial environment. Everything you
see and hear is computer technology,”
Conde Gonzalez, event coordinator of
Virtual Realities Productions, said.

PPC Director of Special Events Todd
Cable said that the response has been
great. “There'is always a line,” he said.

,First-year Pitt student Mike McDonald
said, “Mediocre. It did not compare to
[Stephen King’s Creation in his movie]
The Lawnmower Man.”

Gonzalez said that virtual reality tech-
nology is actuallylfrom the 1960s. It
began as ﬂight simulators in the military.

Virtual reality is also being used in
architecture and medicine.

According to Gonzalez, Virtuality
gives players a tremendous amount of
freedom, and no two games are alike.
“It is totally up to you,” he said.

“I thought it was kind of strange.' It
could be interesting if you really learned
how to do it,” first-year student Sarah
Pressman said.

“Certainly different. You got to get
used to it. I have heard about it, but I
had never experienced it. Overall, it was
interesting,” first—year graduate student

‘Jorge Latorre said.

Gonzalez said that the overall
response to Virtuality in the nation has
been favorable. All ages, from five to 85,
enjoy it. “It is pretty awesome,” he said.

Virtuality will be in the Union
Thursday and Friday from 11 a.m. to 9
p.m. It is free for all Pitt students with
valid identification.

ing Mehrabian was not in at the
moment. ‘

“[Mehrabian] is unavailable.
Apparently he had an appoint-
ment today at the Pentagon,
and was not able to accept this
bread,” Eirene said.

When asked about the less-
than-a-dozen protesters who
had shown up, Eirene respond-
ed, “I am never disappdinted

quality of the people here out-

“All those of you who doubt
that, because of the smallness
of this demonstration, it’s
somehow ineffectual.

thing. But we always need to

‘X ’ 1S coming

Spike Lee is undoubtedly one of the most inﬂuential
and controversial film makers of our time. His films
have explored a broad range of social topics, from
inter-racial couples in jungle Fever to inner-city race
relations in Do The Right Thing. While Lee’s films con-
tain deeper—than-surface meanings, his last two pic-
tures have created stirs in the media and on the streets
with their abrasive portrayal of life.‘

On Nov. 20, Lee’s long awaited movie about the life
and teachings of Malcolm X will be. released nation-
wide. The hype surrounding this film has been incredi-
ble. And it is now nearly impossible to walk the streets
without seeing someone who is wearing an X. The
mystique of Malcolm X is once again at the forefront of
everyone’s mind. -3

Lee has added fuel to the fire by calling on blacks to
skip school or work and attend the opening of his
film. He told the Los Angeles Times, “We’re telling them

they’ve got to turn out to support this film and support ’

Malcolm.”

Malcolm X is an important historical figure. Every
facet of society needs strong characters with whom
they can identify. The fact that American society has
only recently started to accept the impact that
Malcolm X had on our culture is a disgrace. Our edu-
cational system is such that African-American curricu-
lum and the contributions made by blacks throughout
American and world history are often pushed aside.

Malcolm X is a breakthrough movie. And as a direc-

tor, Lee is trying to‘ break through the educational
establishment and helping to create analternative cur-
riculum.

It is a strong statement _to say everyone should skip
work and school. But strong statements are what make
people take notice. His comment was not about alien-
ating whites, it was about solidarity for blacks. If he
gets half of the turnout he requested, his message will
be heard.

Although Lee specifically requested that African-
Americans go and see this movie, it would be benefi-
cial for everyone to go and take a look at this picture.
Malcolm X, as a historical figure, is someone that
everyone should learn more about.

But he is not the only African-American historical fig-
ure that Americans should learn more about. There is
Fredrick Douglas, an abolitionist and writer of the
late19th century; Charles Drew, a surgeon who found-

ed the American Red Cross blood bank; Langston

Hughes, a poet and writer of the mid—20th century; and
architect Pierre L’Enfant, whose plans were used in the
development of Washington D.C. Hopefully this film
will start the change to cultural education we desper-
ately need.

Warning to all citizens of
Pennsylvania: if you are inter-
ested in sending your child to a
public high school, get out of
the state while you still can. In
its infinite wisdom, the state
legislature has created 52 addi-
tional requirements for gradu-
ation from a public high
school.

These requirements are
based not on academic perfor-
mance, but on how those stu-
dents feel about racial and sex-
ual. relations, the environment
and other social and political
issues. What these require-
ments really mean is a genera-
tion of unthinking, politically
correct robots.

This is just one in a-series of
politically correct agendas that
are working their way into our
public school curriculums.
Before long our kids will be
learning that the assassination
JFK was a conspiracy of the

.military industrial complex,

Vietnam was a mistake and that
Edward Kennedy is Jesus
Christ. .
Have we not learned from
our mistakes? Isn’t it about time
we realize that the more politi-
cal or social agendas are

emphasized, the less actual.

education is emphasized?

One common misconception
of the American education sys-
tem is that in comparison to
other nations, it simply is not
long enough. “The Japanese go
to school 246 days out of the
year. If we did that we
wouldn’t have to sell out our
country like we are now,” said
my fraternity brother. I sighed.

What he fails to realize is that
we could teach our children
365 days of the year and it
wouldn’t do any good as long

as we keep shoving these
agendas down their throats.
Under the current system, our
high-school students can barely
recognize the United States on
a map (let alone who its neigh-
bors are), or the capital cities of

'most states. Is it reasonable to

distract our students even fur-
ther with lessons on “how to
be nice to people?” Of course
not.

Nat
Finkin

The answer to our current
educational woes lies not in
new and innovative ideas from
the liberal establishment’s polit-
ical and social agenda, but in
the past. The answer’ has been
here all along: teach children
the basics. .

Every high-school graduate
should be able to read, write
and perform basic mathemati-
cal equations. They should
have a ‘sense of American and
world history, and know basic
geography. The three “R’s” are
all that need to be taught.
Anyone with a grasp on those
fundamentals is prepared to do
anything in life, whether it be

to study Shakespeare or to‘

design buildings.

The more social and political
issues are taught, the more the
actual fundamentals get set
aside, or rushed through. Right
now, our students are having a
hard enough time reading a
newspaper to bother with the
reasons why they should recy-
cle it. Issues such as the envi-
ronment, sexual and racial rela-

  Keep liberals away from edacation

tions and common manners
should be kept out of the
schools and put into the
homes, churches and local’
communities where they
belong. This way, children can
fully grasp the fundamentals
once again.

However, it is not 1950 any-
more, and often there is no sta-
ble home in which our children
can form their own ideology.
But one of the reasons why we
see unstable homes, poverty
and unemployment is due to
poor education.

When a student graduates
high-school barely able to add
two and two, but knows how
much energy a fluorescent light
bulb saves, does very little
good. The impoverished peo-
ple of this country are poor
due in large part to a poor edu-
cation. '

The more fundamentals are
stressed, the more likely that
students everywhere will have
a better chance of furthering
their education and contribut-

ing to society, or getting a well- '

paying job out of high school.
Perhaps the reason college
educations are stressed so
much in the workplace is
because employers know that
no one learns anything in high
school!

The time has come to teach
our children, and stop telling
them how to think. Right now
we are in a vicious cycle, and
when the Pennsylvania legisla-
ture further. contaminated our
students already—polluted cur-
riculum, the only thing they did
was make that spin cycle a’ lit-
tle bit faster.

Of all the heavenly things
that have come out of this
new love rock thing, Throw
may be the closest to bliss.
But then again, it may not
even be love. It’s more like
lust, where the feelings are
impulsive and quick, but
never dangerous, unlike
love which can kill. But, the
movement has been dubbed
love rock, and this compila-
tion is an outstanding exam-
ple of the genre’s encom-
passing sounds.

It’s tough to decipher
where you draw the line
between what is love rock
and what isn’t, but it doesn't
matter here as almost every-
thing makes you wanna
hold hands and blow wet
kisses. Many of these bands

N.C. superstars Superchunk

songs, a new and improved
version of “Skip Steps One And

the vocals, it’s a fine example
of their unique ability to mesh
power-pop guitars with big

“Coming Down” is a low-ridin’
bass diddy with stripped-down

contibution, and your not soon.

to forget with its joyful banjo
picking and pretty vocals.
Jennifer Saymore comes off as
the shy, innocent little girl who
I can just picture on stage with
hands folded at her waist sadly
crooning “I don’t know what
I’m gonna do/ if you look at
me again/ the way that you
do.” Al Larsen (lead singer ‘of
Some Velvet Sidewalk) delivers
an anguished question mark of
pleasant feedback that seems to
strike a similar chord to local
Karl Hendricks “Sometimes All
I Have is questions/ like what
makes a boy,” or “how do you
say more than you were born
to say?” Gees sometimes this
love rock ‘thing can be so gru-
eling.

G1ad’s “Pry” is a punkish pop
revver that somehow seems to
avoid committing itself to its
obvious influences (7 Seconds
or even one of those power-
pop NC bands). DC’s Bikini Kill
let loose with a milky mid-
tempo rocker that even lends
itself to a rare (love rock) guitar
solo. But, a few of the cuts are

stapled in the Beat Happening
happy, snappy perk-filled slap-
py drumming and jangled gui-
tar riffs. Go Team (a BHoff
shoot) follow this formula to a
tee while the McTells travel a
similar road with a big drum
kick. Courtney Love’s “Spray” is
a keeper with hushed vocals
that smothers you in euphoric
ideals “How happy to have one
perfect day.”

All in all, it’s 22 songs to
make out or make a move
with, or on, that appear as
innocent as a puppy. But it
asks deep personal questions
that pry but never offend.
Sometimes it can sound like
bad karaoke, with wobbled
vocals and make—shift instru-
mentations, but the amueturish
appeal gives almost all the
tracks, and .genre it’s sweet
charm; With mostly girlyvocals
and quick jabs that clip and dab
and lure you into sing—along
tactics, it’s no wonder a whole
new’ generation of under-

ground folks are discovering ‘

the kiss—and—tell appeal of Love
Rock, and if this is an example

of it then it’s a grand one. You
decide, if you feel like giving
an innocent but interested glare
at a cute boy or girl, then
you’re already a lovey, sap-
filled, dreamy—eyed member of
the movement.

Epic soundtrack

Seattle, Seattle, Seattle.

Does any competent and
trailblazing wattage illume from
elsewhere? It’s doubtful.

Especially after absorbing the
smokin’ soundtrack from the
movie Singles, a romantic coin-
edy about young couples living
in — appropriately —— Seattle.

Recruiting the likes of Pearl
Jam, Soundgarden and
Mudhoney, the 15—slice pack-
age of movie—backing further
amplifies the stature of the
Emerald City as the preeminent
capital of fresh smoulder-rock.
The work of the mostly Seattle-
bred groups alone is worth the

permission to please the audio
senses, but with the additions
of Paul Westerberg and
Smashing Pumpkins, it’s a clas-
sic heart—stomping and
whiskey-smooth collection — a
heavy imagery festival.

Pearl Jam claims king of this
intense Seattle battle, punching
in with the double-dingers
“Breath” and “State of Love and
Trust.” Riding the cardiovascu-
lar roller coaster known as
Eddie Vedder’s vocals, “Breath”
exhales repeatedly into theear-
lobes like a sonic massage from
the masseuse gods of rock: “All
these reaching hands  out
grabbing things/ Day in, day out

oh-quoom-u-lating.” In
“State of Love and Trust,” the
eerie optimism continues, leav-
ing listeners yearning for more
of the ‘Jam.

That taste for more is around
the corner, quenched by the
boys from Soundgarden. The
dual ditties of “Birth Ritual” and
“Seasons” —-— the latter a quiet
stroll by ‘Garden leader Chris
Cornell -— brilliantly display the

band’s versatility to crank or quiet at its
discretion. Cornell’s vocals in “Seasons”
give the simple rhythm guitar a stark,
authoritative companion, rendering a
baffo ballad: “And the naked floor is
cold as hell/the naked floorqreminds
me/the naked ﬂoor reminds me/that I’m
lost.” , ‘

‘. Companionship continues in “Chloe

  -1"-‘Dancer” incorporates desolate

piano" pricks with Wood’s gymnastic
brooding for a mid-album reminder

- -about a “dream” that “must die.” The

knowledge of the lead crooner’s demise
does nothing but enhance the solitude

that drives the awkwardly keen anthem.

Another depression—induced minstrel
comes by way of the Chicago—based
Smashing Pumpkins, whose tune title
appropriately defines the spirit needed
to listen to the song. “Drown” is a
vengeful rendition of anger and spite
blown open by some fuzz-producing
axe work: “No matter where you are/ I
can still hear you drown.” It follows the
same tone of U2’s “So Cruel,” thriving at
a different level thanks to extended har-
mony and believable bitterness.

The somber moodswings of
Pumpkins and Mother Love Bone
remain palatable thanks to. the shining
star of the album, Paul Westerberg.

The above-and-beyond absolute
excuse to purchase Singles comes cour-

tesy of the matching nuggets con-
tributed by the ex—front man of the
Replacements. Last heard trying to
resuscitate Joan Jett’s career, the down-
to—grunge Minneapolis native picks up
where his former band left off in its cur-
tain call, All Sboole Down.

Solo Paul pens the best song on the
album in “Dyslexic Heart,” a hot—and-
cold emotionsfest neatly wrapped in a
shiny, strummin’ fashion. As the title
suggests, the song deals with the yo—yo
mindset of a‘ confused guy in love  or
hate: “Do I date you?/do I .hate you?/I
got a dyslexic heart.” The tight—as—a-
drum percussion accents the group cho-
rus (“Na Na Nu-nah! Na na-nuh na—na!”)
in brilliant'folk—giddyup style.

“Waiting for Somebody” explodes to

an emphatic “Huuugh!” immediately fol—_
lowed by a trail of quick—hitting rhythm
guitar riffs that merge effortlessly with
Westerberg’s tough, simple vocals: “You
come along/it doesn’t really matter/I go
it alone/doesn’t even hurt — All my
life/waiting for somebody.” It employs a
straight-ahead concept (hard—luck antici-
pation of love) with classic-rock gang
harmony to create a great tune. 8

Alice in Chains, Screaming Trees, The
Lovemongers and even Jimi Hendrix
(also a Seattle man, albeit a dead one)
also check in with single forays of_
smoke, though their offerings are a bit
unpolished compared to the stellar
achievements of Westerberg,‘ Pearl Jam
and the Pumpkins.

Move

Continued from page 8
young junkie who runs with
the wrong pack.

The "film begins in L.A.
where the desperate trio stages
a gruesome raid in search of
drugs. As Pluto muzzles each
of the hostages, Franklin’s
camera pans the floor and
leaves exposing, disturbing
extended shots of the tied cap-
tives. After Pluto jams a needle

into one of the victims and Ray,

suffocates another with a plas-
tic bag, the mood is set for a
highly-tense adventure with no
rhyme or reason for the char-
acter’s actions, other than sin-
cere, selﬁsh concerns.

Of course the police have to
be involved, and what Franklin
delivers is a ﬁnely—grained por—
trayal of big town/ small town
police-force mentality. As the
trio ﬂee L.A., with a heap of
cash and coke, the story slowly
evolves around the group’s
anticipated arrival in the‘ironi—
Cally titled Star City, Arkansas
— a stereotypically correct ver-

sion of Boondocks, Southern
U.S.A. Much of the film’s
appeal lies in it’s Southern por—
trayals of small-town life.
“Hurricane” Dixon (Bill
Paxton) is the town’s sheriff
with a small-town family men-
tality and an underlying pas-
sion for big-city police investi-
gation. He may be a bit fool-
ish, but damn he’s committed.
The L.A. cops take a more
relaxed approach to the whole
case, dealing with the fugitives
on realistic, deadly terms, but
with just the right amount of
sarcasm to urge on the hyper
Hurricane. The distinctions of
the forces is clearly shown as
the Hurricane dreams of going
to L.A., while the L.A. cops
can’t get enough of the deli-
cious home cookin’
Hurricane’s wife serves up.

Franklintakes time to let his

plot work itself out and injects
so much into it that everything
is able to come together with-
out ever losing its focus.
Pluto’s prison and crime

records are more than just
announced as reasons for his
crazy doings, they are
enhanced because of the
scripts strong characteriza-
tions. Particularly strong is
Fantasia who grabs the film’s
latter spotlight. A troubled, but
beautiful youth, her past deal-

ings with Hurricane — both’

are from Star City and share
the same big-city dreams, a
dominant tone of Franklin’s
small town portrayal. — are
hinted at, but fully developed
in the film’s dramatic climax.
Ray is the only character who
we aren’t fully informed of, but
his actions and mannerisms are
never predictable, and if he’s
the trio’s (who can’t get it
together) leader, then Franklin
does a wonderful job of dis-
guising it by playing on his
sloppiness. ,

The waning moments‘ are
highlighted by intense scenes
that go from action—fil1ed vio-
lence to settled, yet abrasive
personal confrontations that

are revealing and never cliched
or boring. The film’s climax is
powerful and a fine barometer
of the script’s stickiness, as all
the themes Franklin introduces
tie together (much of it sud-
denly rushed upon the viewer
by the Hurricane-Fantasia
affair). Despite it’s dominant
violence, the ending plays par-
ticularly well on emotions and
past suffering, but doesn’t
leave the pulp, more like con-
centrated orange juice than
fresh squeezed. One False
Move though, is strong and
rugged throughout. It is a grip-
ping, urgent portrayal of guns
on the run and a hardened
look at contrasting lifestyles
and locations.

lent cinematic eﬂort from little

Hold on to the football!

Coaches scream this order constant-
ly to their players, sometimes to deaf
ears. Turnovers are the greatest con-
cern of West Virginia Coach Don
Nehlen, as far as offense is con-
cerned, as his team enters its second
game of the season this Saturday at
Pitt.

The Mountaineers fumbled the ball

‘seven times last week at Miami, OH
and lost five of them.

“Of the 29 points they scored we
gave them 17 to 20 of them,” Nehlen
said. “When we didn’t fumble, we
played extremely well. We gained
over 500 yards against a ranked
defense a year ago. Every time you
turn around, we were fumbling the

. football. It was bouncing off our
heads, it was bouncing off the
ground  it was embarrassing, the
way we dropped the ball.”

West Virginia does have a strong
running game, second to Syracuse in
the Big East last year, led by senior
tailback Adrian Murrell. Murrell
racked up 904 yards and seven
touchdowns last season. He showed
his receiving skills las-t week with five
catches for 99 yards and a touch-

. down. 4

Murrell runs behind a huge line,

averaging 282 pounds per player and
anchored by siX—foot-seven-inch, 290-

Mountaineers must apply
stick-um to slick ﬁngers

pound center Mike Compton; an All-
American candidate.

Behind that group they run the
option, but who runs the that option
still is not settled. Nehlen said he will
play both of his sophomore quarter-
backs, Darren Studstill and Notre
Dame transfer Jake Kelchner.

“They both played well [last
week],” Nehlen said. “I thinkthe
Kelchner kid has a lot of ability. He
made aecouple of mistakes, but also
made a couple of big plays.”

WVU is the second of seven teams
the Panthers will play this season that
run the option. Pitt defensive coordi-
nator Nick Rapone stressed defending
against the option as a key concern
for that very reason. The team did
totally shut down the Kent State
option in last week’s game, but then
again, the Golden Flashes have an
offensive line about the same size as
that of most high school teams in
Western Pennsylvania.

Pitt did have trouble stopping the _

dive, as evidenced by a 64-yard run
off the right side by Kent tailback
Troy Robinson. They could have a
real problem stopping the running
game — especially with Tom
T umulty out of the defense“ with the
torn pectoralis muscle he suffered
against Kent.

The West Virginia passing game
was not much of a threat last year, as
they were second from the bottom of

Defense, defense, defense.

If head coach Don Nehlen’s West
Virginia Mountaineers have any hopes
of taking a “W” back to Morgantown
this Saturday in the 85th edition of the
“Backyard Brawl,” first on their priority
list must be to slow down the Pitt
Panther offensive steamroller.

Easier said than done.

With four-year starting quarterback
Alex Van Pelt and halfback Curtis Martin
leading a ground—and—air attack that
promises offensive pressure on every
down, head coach Don Nehlen has rea-
son to worry —— especially following a
disappointing 29-29 season—opening tie
to Miami of Ohio at Mountaineer Field.

The WVU defense wasn’t horrible last
week —— yielding just 287 yards — but
didn’t step up to compensate for a
plethora of turnovers on offense, result-
ing in four Redskin touchdowns.

“Defensively, we played average [last
week],” Nehlen said. “We weren’t good,
we weren’t bad, but [we] were some-
where in the middle.”

That “somewhere in the middle”
mode of defense has to worry Nehlen,
who knows full well the firepower
capabilities of the other blue—and-gold

V team.

“Offensively, they really look to me
like a real dominant football team,”
Nehlen said. “[Tl1eirl offensive line —
they’re the biggest bunch of guys I ever
saw in my life.

Undersized W W] defense braces
for explosive Panther offense

larger than most folks.”

Confronting the tumultuous training
table line of Pitt for trench high jinks is
defensive coordinator Steve Dunlap’s
light-but—experienced quartet of line-
men. Playing a straight 4-5 defense,
junior Scott Gaskins (six—feet two—inch—
es, 264 pounds) and senior Rick Dolly
(6’—4”, 250) hold down the interior,
while senior ends Tom Briggs (6’—5”,
230) and Boris Graham (6’-2”, 230) have
their sights set on a the Panthers sharp

two—niner, Mr. Martin, and the rest of

Pitt’s stacked backﬁeld.

Assisting the WVU trench—men is a
diminutive-but-quick trio of linebackers,
whom Nehlen says “are not very big,
but our linebackers run pretty good.”
Juniors Wes Richardson (6’-2”, 229) and
Tim Brown (6-0’’, 210) will both see
action at middle backer, with
Richardson starting. On the outsides,
sophomore Puppy Wright’ patrols the
strongside position; sophomore Matt
Taffoni getting the weakside nob.

While a hearty and experienced
offensive line and running game can
spell disaster for any defense, the air
warfare of Van Pelt, Green and Bouyer
could likely add salt washings to the
veritable “Razor—induced” wounds that
plague the WVU defense come
Saturday.

Combating such an assault will be an
experienced defensive backfield of cor-
nerbacks Kwame Smith, Tommy Orr
and Leroy’ Axem. Orr and Smith will
start, but Axem may be the most valu-
able of the three — playing backup at

W/o7nen’s
tennis team
begins play

at Colonials

By Tom Schneider
Staﬂ Writer

The Pitt women’s
tennis team starts the
1992 fall season this com-
ing Thursday, Sept. 10.
They will invade
Coraopolis, Pa., where
they hope to start the
season on a winning
note against the vastly
outclassed Robert Morris
Colonials.

Senior Julie LoPrinzi
will lead a Pitt team with
several returning letter-
winners. LoPrinzi, along
with Jennifer Jacobs,
Erika
Nieswenter and the rest
of the Lady Panthers will
be looking to improve on
the team’s last-place fin-
ish in the Big East last
year. ’

“Our team this year
is as good, if not
better, than last year’s
team,” head coach
George Dieffanbach said.

The Colonials will
attempt to battle Pitt with
a new coach and a six-
player roster — several
of which are walk-ons.

Robert Morris is com-
ing off a 3-11 record last

season and fifth7place .

finish in the Northeast
Conference.

They also lost four let-
ter winners to graduation,
and the core of seniors
they have now consists
of a mediocre number-
three, singles player‘ and
two very good basketball
players.

RMC’s only hope
for -success against
the Panthers lies with
senior Kelly Sabol and
junior transfer Erin
Schlegel. _

Sabol had a_ strong sea-
son at the number two
singles player last year,
finishing with an 11-4
record.

Schlegal

Robert Morris out

of Carrollton, Texas to .

move into the Colonials’
number one singles spot.

She is-also one of two
RMC players that lives
farther away than
Ambridge.

First—year Colonial head
coach Tom Fleming said
of his hopes for next
year.

“We are looking for-
ward to recruiting for
next season.”

After playing Robert

Morris, Pitt will play in I

the Duquesne Invitational
this weekend. ~

The Panthers will
return home to host

Volleyball team looks
for first victory in Ohio

By Cory Walborn
Staff Writer

Coming off a positive but still
disappointing Nebraska touma—
ment, the Pitt volleyball team
returns to action this weekend
trying to replace the zero in its
win column.

The Panthers (0-3) take their
young and inexperienced show
on the road as they travel to
Miami, Ohio totake on the
likes of Northern Illinois,
Purdue and tournament host
Miami (Ohio) University.

Starting off with Miami
(Ohio) on Friday, the Panthers
have a good chance to get their
first win of the season.

“Miami has two starters
injured and they graduated two
of their top players,” Pitt head
coach Sue Woodstra said.
“They are a little rough right
now.” .

That roughness should give
Pitt’s first-year players a chance
to continue to mesh into the
Panther’s offensive "attack.

with Northern Illinois. Northern
Illinois is an up-and-coming
team that won its Mid-
Continent conference a year
ago.
“ hey [Northern Illinois] have
all their players returning this
season,” Woodstra said. “They
are going to surprise some
teams this year.”

Northern Illinois is a solid
team that features good athletes
and good size. This match
should pose the only threat to
a Panther squad trying to over-
come the inconsistency that
will plague them this early in
the season.

The last match of the week-

end will showcase Virtually
unknown Purdue against‘ the
Panthers.
. “We’re not really sure about
Purdue,” Woodstra said of a
team with no prominent play-
ers or coach. V

Some thoughtless predictions from mindless writers

By Jim Lakely
and Brian Gallagher
The Pitt News

Week one of the National Football
League regular season got off to an
explosive start with a mega-Steeler sur-
prise,‘ a Redskin scalping and a season
full of bone-crushing Eagle-blasts at the
Vet.

With all 28 teams from America's bad-
dest game hitting respective grass and
turf for week number two, it’s appropri-
ate to back up our aimless fodder con-
cerning the Eagles and Falcons — every
team for that matter — and get on with
it with some smacking picks.

Here are week twO’s game-by—game

prediction, spewedfoith by the editor ~

of the sports department and one of his
lead lackies —JL and BG.

N.Y. Jets at Pittsburgh (+1): Steelers
will be smokin’ after monster win at the

in Atlanta, but a raucous Three Rivers
crowd and mean Mr. Lloyd will bring
the jets crashing down again. Take the
Steelers and the points.

_ Dallas at N.Y. Giants (+3): The (3-
Men are a much better team than their
17-point embarrassment to San
Francisco last ' week showed. The
Cowboys are riding the wave of Jimmy
JOhnson’s ugly surf hair—do. L.T. and the
boys are gonna wipe “America’s Team”
Out. New York won’t need the three
points. Take the Giants toiwin.

Chicago at New Orleans (-4): The
Bears pulled out a thriller in the final
seconds against Detroit last week. Make
no mistake, the Monsters and the Fridge
are back in Chicago. New Orleans has
the best fat man in football in “Iron
Head” Heyw_ard and their only chance
will be to hand himthe ball 40 times.
Mora won’t do it and neither will the
Saints. Take Chicago in the Dome.

Minnesota at Detroit (-3.5): New

breathed life into a team that has been
treading water for years. Once a team
consideredga lock for the Super Bowl,
they are now in decline. For Detroit I’ve
got two words: Bany Sanders. Enough
said. Take Detroit to cover the 3.5
points.

Atlanta at Washington (-10): Skins
looked horrific in their Monday night
loss to overrated Cowboys. Glanville’s
Falcons were lucky to survive jet attack
at the Georgia Dome. Washington
wakes up big time, giving its fans a rea-
son to believe again. Blow-out city
baby. Take the Skins minus the points.

Seattle at Kansas City (-10): First the
Chargers, now the Seahawks. The
Chiefs have the luxury of warming up
against two of the worst teams in the
AFC. Old Seattle hero Dave Krieg will
hand the ball Off and watch the Chiefs
running backs ram it down his old bud-
dies’ throats. Take the Chiefs minus the
points.

Green Bay at Tampa Bay (-2.5):

Battle Of the bumbling bays is the dozer
runner-up of the week. The Pack is
heading for the Central division base-
ment, while the Bucs sport bright pants
and a bright future. A no brainer.
Buccaneers minus the points.

Houston at Indianapolis (+9.5):
The Oilers got a rude wake-up call from
the Steelers last week and will be hell
bent On revenge. But they won’t get it
here. First-round picks Steve Emtman
and Quentin Coryatt have made a sud-
den impact — helping sack Bernie Kosar
11 times, Shocker of the Week. Take
the Colts to pressure Moon and cover
the spread.

Buffalo at San Francisco (-3.5): In a
battle of Super Bowl contenders, a high
point shoot—out is guaranteed. ‘Frisco is
a better road bet. Take Kelly and Co.
with the points in the best game of the
week. ‘

Philadelphia atlPhoenix (+6.5):
R.C., the Uncola (Randall Cunningham).

By Brian Gallagher

Senior Staff Writer

The story of the‘1992 Pitt
kicking game was supposed to
be a tale of veteran placekick-
ers. With years of gameday
experience in the legs of
seniors Scott Kaplan, Eddie
Frazier and junior Ted
D’Allesandro, the Panther kick-

Qing duties looked to be filled to

the hilt with capable booters.

But a funny thing happened
on the wayvto a predictable
plotline.

A walk-on junior with just
two years of organized football
under his powerful right foot
blasted‘ his way onto the top of
the Panther depth chart and
won Big East Special Teams
Player of the Week in his debut
on the Pitt Stadium turf.

His name: Sean Conley.

satisfied with Conley’s first

 

Pennsylvania has given Pitt
coaches and fans several rea-
sons to believe the placekick—
ing duties are in good hands.
Or at least on the right toe.

In his Panther debut, Conley
blasted half of his kickoffs
through the end zone for
touchbacks, drilled a 31-yard
field goal and connected on six
of seven extra points — his
lone miss was blocked.

The sparkling opening night
for Conley, a graduate of
Mercyhurst Prep, gave Pitt’s
special teams a needed boost
following the loss of senio
starting placekicker Scott
Kaplan. Kaplan underwent an
emergency appendectomy
three weeks ago, and is not
expected to return for two
weeks.

Despite having no experi-
ence at the Division I level,
head coach Paul Hackett was

foray on the Pitt Stadium turf.

coaching opening

By Stephen Flinn
Sta_[)" Writer

Pitt replaced departeda'ssistant coach John Sarandrea with for-
mer Duquesne University assistant Joe DeSantis last week.
Sarandrea resigned to take a high school basketball coaching job
close to his home in New Castle.

Desantis had been coaching at Duquesne for the past three
years. Previously he coached at his alma mater, Fairfield
University, in Connecticut. 3 ‘

He resigned from Duquesne on Sept. 2 to accept the coaching
position at Pitt and wasted little time getting to work. .

“I am just trying to get moved in to my office and I am already
making plans to leave for a recruiting trip on Thursday,” DeSantis
said.

Football fans always find
something disturbing about

the American Football
Conference’s Western
Division. Every year there’s

at least three contenders
waiting to spread their wings,
and every year they fall on
their faces like a bunch of
two-year-olds on roller

1 skates.

The big question is, are
they gunslingers this Season
or just a batch_ of fake gold
coming out of the West?
Aside from Al Davis’ great
Raider teams, the only-other
squad to bring home a Super
Bowl’--trophy to the AFC
Western Division was Kansas
City back in 1970. Yet almost
every year, football critics’
and odds—makers pin the tail
on one of the donkeys com-
ing out of this division.
Denver Broncos: Denver
will win this frantic division
hands down. But that’s com-
ing from a guy who picked
the Red Sox to win ,baseball’s
American League Eastern
Division. The Broncos have
enough guns to rival any East
L.A. gang. Quarterback john
Elway is still as cool as the
other side of the pillow and
last year’s AFC Rookie of the
Year, linebacker Mike Croel,

will continue to be the Spark
plug of a defense that fin-
ished first in the AFC this
past season.

Denver did very little to
improve its chances during
the draft, but it secured its
future by grabbing UCLA
sophomore quarterback
Tommy Maddox with its first
pick. Maddox will run the
Show when Elway is gone
but right now he’ll be waiting
patiently on the sidelines
watching Elway perform.

Head Coach Dan Reeves
will have one less missile to
fire this season. After a con-
tract holdout and a disap-
pointing season last year,
Reeves sent running back
Bobby Humphrey to Miami
in exchange for power run-
ner Sammie Smith. Smith
won’t figure to get much play

in Denver especially with_

new-found thoroughbred

Gaston Green leading the

ground game.

Green racked up 1,037
rushing yards last season,
which made Humphrey
expendable. Mark Jackson
and Vance Johnson are still
two of the best wideouts in
the game. Both had disap-
pointing seasons last year
catching a combined four
touchdowns, but with
Elway’s slight of hand either
one can become a game

breaker at any time.

The defense is solid. Steve
Atwater and Dennis Smith
lead the charge in the sec-
ondary, gwhile Karl
Mecklenberg, Croel, Michael
Brooks and Simon Fletcher
make up the second best
linebacking core in football
save the Saints.

Los Angeles Raiders: Raider
fans have a lot to look for-
ward to this season. A draft
day trade brought the NFL’s
third all-time leading rusher
Eric Dickerson from the hap-
less Colts to the open arms of
Al Davis and his Raider team.

Head coach Art Shell is
entering his fourth season
with the Raiders and he’ll
have a few major decisions to
make that will decide the fate
of his team. If he splits time
in the backfieldgbetween
Dickerson and Marcus Allen,
Dickerson could return to his
bickering ways which sent
him from the Rams to the
Colts then back to Los
Angeles as .a Raider. The last
thing Shell needs is dissen-
sion in the ranks.

The other major decision is
between quarterbacks Jay
Schroeder and Todd
Marinovich. Second—year man
Marinovich got the nod in the
last regular season game for
LA against the Chiefs com-

Panther sec

By Rob Pugliese
Senior Staﬂ Writer

He is as fast as the name
implies, maybe even faster.
Seven times an NCAA All-
American sprinter, he col-
lected an Olympic gold
medal as an alternate on the

relay team this summer in
Barcelona.

The sight of him loose on
a hitch route or deep on a
post pattern keeps defensive
coordinators awake through
the wee hours. _

The Pitt secondary will be
in for its first true test of the
season this Saturday against
West Virginia. It’s a test that
promises to be stem with
the receiver some call “the
fastest man in college foot-
ball” to come to town.

the Panther secondary is
blessed with a fine pair of
safeties, the cornerbacks are
for the most part, unproven.
Jett, a 5-foot-10-inch, 160-
pound senior  ‘ from
Shenandoah Junction, West
Virginia hasstarted at split
end for three years, and
with WVU looking to throw
the football more this sea-
son, he could finally bust
 out. ’ -
-. “We would like to. put the

game,” Mountaineer head
coach Don Nehlen said.
Jett played sparingly in the
' Mountaineers’ 29-29 tie with
Miami (Ohio) last week on a
tender knee but still man-
aged to fry the Redskins for
a 46-yard touchdown recep-
tion. In addition, he racked
up 177 all-purpose yards,
carrying the ball ‘once for
seven yards, returning five
punts for 59 yards and four
kickoffs for 65 yards. Nehlen
said Jett is in better shape

J United States 4. x 100-meter

That’s James Jett. And while I

 ball"in‘his"'ha'n'ds‘ 10 times a’

ondmy must

ground Mountaineers fett

this week and will be ready
to go full tilt on Saturday.

Pitt cornerback Vernon
Lewis, who will draw the
assignment of covering Jett
one-on—one, expects to see
Jett at full strength.

“Last year they didn’t_ get’

the ball to him enough. This
year they’re gonna have to,”
Lewis said. “He has great
speed. He’s such a great ath-
lete. We’ll.be prepared to
help out the corners but
there’s really no way to pre-
_pare except experience.”
Lewis, a senior, is the
most experienced coverman
the Panthers have and ranks
Jett very "highly as far as
gamebreakers go.

“He’s up there with the -

best  with Rocket (Ismail),
with Qadry (Ismail),” Lewis
said. “And we have a guy
right here at Pitt in Dietrich.
I play against a guy every-
dayﬁin practice who has just
as much speed, if not more.”

Although Pitt has been

vulnerable to blazers of Jett’s
caliber over the years, Jett
has not exactly gone crazy
against" ‘the Panthers. In
1989’s memorable 31-31
deadlock at Morgantown,
-Jett scorched Pitt for a 59-
yard touchdown on the
game’s third» play but fin-

ished with only two recep-

tions for 81‘ -yards.’ .

As a sophomore, Jett"

caught three passes for 54

yards- and a touchdown in a ~‘

38-17 West Virginia rout.
Last year, Pitt shut Jett and
the entire Mountaineer
attack down. Jett finished
with just one reception for
13 yards in a 34-5 Panther
mauling; _ '

“He has not really pound-
ed us over the years but he
can always rip off a big
play,”. Pitt head coach Paul

By Rob Pugliese and

The Pitt News

Guess who’s back? Not the
overrated Dallas Cowboys, but
the unheralded and underrated-
SchoolBoys Two who went 20--

'11 last season (.645 percent)

and made beaucoup ducats for
the entire Pitt community. Just
like Washington’s Purple Haze
defense, we’re comin’ at cha,
harder than last season.

Michigan Wolverines (+ 3) at
Notre Dame Fighting Irish (1-
O).

The sixth-ranked Wolverines
open their season in South
Bend against Lou Holtz’s club,
that didn’t look too impressive
last week in routing
Northwestern. Theluck of the.
Irish is in‘ effect with another
season of Notre Dame football
on NBC. 'Get ready for lots of
clovers and leprechauns.

This has quietly evolved into
one of college football’s fiercest
rivalries. "The last few seasons
have seen these two take turns.

sives on each other -—— Raghib

Heisman winner, Desmond

That’s all done with. Time for
some old Midwestern smash-1'

_mouth football. Two of the

F nations most talented, deepest

‘ and basically slammin’ back-

fields (along with Washington,
Florida and Nebraska).

Elvis is back in the house.
Elvis Grbac has more experi-
ence than any quarterback in
the Top 25 right now, holding
a 23-5 mark as a starter. The
nation’s most efficient passer of
1991 loses Howard but junior
Darrick Alexander returns after
missing all of last season due to
a knee injury he sustained in
the opener. Alexander gives
Grbac a deep threat.

The Michigan ground assault
will be punishing with junior
Ricky Powers and sophomores
Jesse Johnson and Tyrone
Wheatley running things.
Powers didn’t get a lot of props
with Howard and Grbac always
around, but he’s one of the
best backs in the nation with
1,197 yards as a sophomore
(tenth—hig_hest total in Michigan
history). Center Steve Everitt
anchors what is always one of
college football’s elite lines
along with 294-pound guard
Joe Cocozzo. . -

Stanley and Tony Henderson
are good enough to start at
nose guard. The Wolves’ plan
on rotating six linemen in and
out of the game. ~

The Irish have one legitimate
Heisman candidate and one
pretender who could be the
most overrated player in the
nation according to Pugs (QB
Rick Mirer who B.B. doesn’t
think is overrated). Their 247-
pound fullback, Jerome Bettis,
is the real deal. He resembles a
bulldozer that moves in very
high gears. He is one of the

most unstoppable forces in the E

nation and deserves some
hype. Reggie Brooks is his run-
ning mate and he sliced
through Northwestern for 157
yards last week. Mike Miller is
being touted as the next Rocket
andhe broke open at close
game late in the third quarter
with a 70-yard TD reception.

The defense is not, repeat 0

NOT, championship caliber.
One more time for Beano Cook
and Lee Corso, two jolly Irish
fans, this defense» isn’t even
close -to being above average.
That is why they are lucky this

is ND and not-any other school .

Soccer team

By Brian Gallagher
Senior Staff‘ Writer

Following a heartbreaking,
opening weekend that featured
two one—goal losses, the
University of Pittsburgh soccer
team opens its 1992 Big East
soccer schedule with road
games at Providence College

and Boston College.
Hoping to rebound from
defeats at the hands of

Bucknell and California (Pa.)
State, the Panthers hope to do
something this weekend
they failed to do all last year:
win a conference game. In
‘91, Pitt was 0-6-2 in league
play.

SQQFI ,é wadtnsiqoa xsbzrrisa gezwain. ’l'II*1 E1111‘
FH»E_ HI I NEWS,.S'5ﬂlrday, September K5419929-

opens Big East schedule

For Pitt forward Scott
Alexander, the weekend pro-
vides two opportunities to
make amends for an opening
weekend of defensive break-
downs and missed opportuni-
ties. It’s also a chance to prove
the Big East coaches wrong.
Pitt was picked last in the pre-
season coaches’ poll.

“Everybody looks past us,”
Alexander said, “but we’ve got
a good bunch of young kids in
— a couple of old guys."

Alexander looks at the Pitt
team of 1990 as reason to be
optimistic about the weekend.
Two years ago, the Panthers
lost 5-2 at Providence, and beat
BC on their turf — the Golden

Eagles first home loss in four
years.

“People already see that
were ranked last [in the coach-
es’ polll and finished last [in
‘91],” Alexander said. “Finishing
last didn’t reflect how we
played.

"We played Seton Hall 2-1
[loss] last game of the season,
and they finished 16th in the
nation.

“We’ll be ready for it. If we’re
not ready today, [Pitt Coach]
Joe Luxbacher will have us
ready by this weekend.”

Pitt plays Providense Friday
at 3:30 p.m., with the Bos-
ton College battle at 1 p.m.
Sunday.

defense that type of speed in practice,” Hackett
said.

Jett is already being touted as one of the
nation’s top sprint prospects for the 1996
Olympics in Atlanta. He was the NCAA runner-
up in both the 100 and 200 meters this year.

On the football field Jett’s best performance
came as a sophomore when he grabbed 51 pass-
es for 652 yards to lead the Mountaineers.

Last season, as a junior, he totaled 818 all—pur—
pose yards for an average of 14 yards per play.
Through last week’s game, Jett has 49 career
receptions for 1,048 yards and a 21.4 yard aver-

Hackett said.
Hackett believes Jett will see the football more
this time around.
“The reason he only caught one pass [last
. week] was because he was a little bit injured and
. didn’t even start,” Hackett said. “We’re gonna
have to double him and get someone up in his
face. He’s a world—class sprinter. We can’t allow
him free access to anywhere on the field.”

“I am extremely excited
about Joe joining our bas-
ketball staff,” says Pitt head
basketball coach Paul Evans,
“We are very fortunate to be
able to attract a candidate
with the extensive experi-
ence as a recruiter, coach
and player  his contacts in
the New York City area will
especially be a valuable
resource for our recruiting
efforts.”

The connections that
DeSantis has established in
New York are certainly war-
ranted.

“Ironically,” DeSantis said,
“I attended the same high
school as John Sarandrea —
Tolentine, in the Bronx. I
also played for Riverside
Church, a highly regarded
A.A.U. team in New York

City. And my alma mater,’

Fairfield University, is only
an hour and a half away
from New York City.”

Coach DeSantis is credited
with being very instrumental
in the recruiting success that
Duquesne has recently
enjoyed. He is considered to
be the reason that
Duquesne was able to
recruit once again in the
New York Metropolitan
area. A a

DeSantis seemed very excit-
ed.

“I am pretty familiar with
Pitt’s personnel,” DeSantis
said. “I think they have a lot
of size, but have some good
perimeter players also. That,
plus playing 16 home
games, certainly doesn’t
hurt.”

DeSantis has been around
the Big East before. He
interviewed for a job at
Boston College a few years
ago. He was also the run-
ner—up for the head coach-
ing position at St. John’s
when it was vacated by Lou
Carnesecca as he retired
after coaching the Redmen
for 24 years.

DeSantis was not sure
how he felt about playing
against Duquesne next year.

“I will be looking forward
to playing Duquesne, but it
will be an interesting sce-
nario to say the least.”

Before going into coach-
ing, the 34-year—old DeSantis
was drafted #44 overall in
the 1979 NBA Draft by
‘Washington, but opted to
play professionally in
Venice, Italy for the 1980
season. In 1981 he tried out
for the Atlanta Hawks and
finished up his playing
career with the Maine
Lumberjacks of the CBA for

_ the 1981 season.

pleting 23 of 40 passes for
243 yards and three touch-
downs in a 27-21 ‘loss. He
also played in the postseason
against Kansas City, complet-
ing only 12 of 23 passes for
140 yards and four intercep-
tions. Schroeder, on the other
hand, ranked 13th out of 14
in passer rating last year
throwing for 19 touchdowns

and nine interceptions.
Wide receiver Tim Brown’s

_late-season performances

helped him bully his way
into the starting line-up as a
wideout. Brown’s running
mate at the receiver spot will
be deep threat Willie Gault.

Another plus for the
Raiders will be second-year
fullback Nick Bell. Bell has
the size and speed to take
the spotlight away from Allen
and Dickerson.

The defense is the only
reason why the Raiders won’t
command a lot of respect this
season. Other than defensive

_.backs Ronnie Lott, Lionel

Washington, Terry McDaniel
and Eddie Anderson LA is
plagued with old age.

1 Kansas City Chiefs:l The

Chiefs have more question
marks than the Riddler’s
wardrobe. Running back
Christian Okoye is trade bait
and Barry Word is slowly get-

ting phased to ‘make room
for Harvey Williams.

Williams is an exciting,
young runner capable of
pu_tting up huge rushing
numbers.

Dave Krieg is the new
helmsman in Kansas City.
Krieg was signed as a Plan B‘
free-agent. The knock on
Krieg is in the lastthree years
he’s thrown 52 interceptions
and 47 touchdowns.

Tim Barnett will run the

. short routes for Krieg, and

ﬂeet-footed JJ. Birden will be
the deep threat. .

The defense will speak for
itself this season. KC has
ﬁelded a dominating defense
for several years. Linebacker
Derrick Thomas heads the
charge for the Chief’s D.
Thomas recorded 13 1/2
sacks, forced four fumbles
and recovered four fumbles
en route to his third Pro
Bowl appearance inas many
seasons.

Top draft pick Dale Carter
will play an immediate role
in the secondary which
already includes Albert Lewis
'and Kevin Ross, two of the
NFL’s best.

Seattle Seahawks/San
Diego Chargers: Take your
pick of which will finish last.
Both teams have as much
chance of success this year as
a screen door in a submarine.
Seattle has no quarterback
(Kelly Stouffer), both wide
receivers (Brian Blades and

' Tommy Kane) are hurt, and

—John L. Williams is their rush-
ing threat. The only plus for
Seattle is that the Seahawks
were the only team in the
AFC last season that didn’t
allow any opponent to rush
for 100 yards or pass for 300
yards in a game. That might
have something to do with
their annual cupcake sched-
ule.

The Chargers are headed
up the same creek with the
same broken paddles.
Despite General Manager
Bobby Beathard’s' maneuvers
to hire a new head coach in
Bobby Ross and trading draft
picks the last few years, San
Diego is going nowhere.
They haven’t been to the

. playoffs in 10 years, and they
don’t look as if they’ll
come anywhere close this
season.

Marion Butts will be their
offensive stud. Butts racked
up 834 rushing yards but all
that does is inspire teams to
stack the defense up. on the
line and dare quarterback
Bob Gagliano to throw.
Gagliano couldn’t hit the
broad side of a barn with a
handful of salt.

Cornerback Gill Byrd is the
only defensive star:-on the
team and he’s injured at the
start of the season. Both
teams are in desperate need
of repair.

THElI’I'Iﬂ‘5P®V!i&,:13quﬂ'dmE;‘Sep&n‘ib?éW1l1§Tl99IH'l:

Conley

Continued from page 5

“He did a magnificent job,”
Hackett said. “[The award] is a
great tribute to him and the job
he did for the first time as a
walk-on. I was very pleased.”

For Conley, Saturday night’s
opener was yet another posi-
tive step in the ascent of the
six—foot-one-inch, 183-pound
specialist, who didn’t learn of
his starting assignment until just
minutes before game time.

“I knew I’d at least be doing
kickoffs,” Conley said, “so I
was prepared all week for
[some playing timel.”

Conley didn’t kick in high
school. In fact, his school didn’t
even have a football team.
Instead, he played soccer, bas-
ketball and baseball, receiving
several offers to play in college.

Kicking became prominent in
1989, when he walked on at
Gannon lPa.] University. There
Conley played two seasons as a

Golden Knight, gaining valu-

able game experience as well.

“My first year was a disaster,”
Conley said. “I was awful. I
made about one field goal all
season. I had no teaching at all
and really didn’t know what I
was doing.”

A big factor in Conley’s leap
to Division I ball is the guid-
ance of current New England
Patriots placekicker and West
Virginia alumnus Charlie
Baumann, who grew up in his
hometown. Conley considers
Baumann his mentor and cred-

its the pro for getting his body
in a Panther uniform.
“He’s one of the guys that I

really owe for being here,”‘

Conley said. “He talked me into
coming here in the first place.
I’d worked with him over the
summers the past few years,
and he helped me a lot.”

As for Conley’s prospects of
starting the rest of the season,
both he and coach Hackett
agree the assignment is any-
thing but a concrete deal —
calling it a “week-to—week”
decision. But because the
Johnstown competition
between the kickers was so
intense, Conley says it is a situ-
ation that has . . and will con-
tinue to  benefit both him
and the entire team.

“We just pushed each other
[in camp], made each other bet-
ter kickers,” Conley said. “I
have those two guys to thank
for that.

“We’ve got a really good situ-
ation with Eddie [Frazierl and
Scott 'lKaplanl. I know that if I
go down, there’s two guys that
can come and do the job.”

It will be somewhat ironic if
Conley provides Pitt with the
decisive points against his men-
tor’s alma mater, but the calm,
collected junior prefers not to
look ahead to such dramas.
Rather, he tries to simply fol-
low_ a tried and true kicking
adage. T

“I just try to take it one kick
at a time,” Conley said.
