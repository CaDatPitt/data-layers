sideswiped

At 11 a.m. yesterday, the S.S.
Universe Explorer was sideswiped by
another boat while traveling along the
Saigon River on its way to Ho Chi
Minh City, Vietnam, according to an
Institute for Shipboard Education press
release. I

’ The ship was carrying more than
600 students,‘ including 40 Pitt students,
enrolled in the fall 2000 Semester at
Sea program. No one was injured and
students are being asked to proceed
with their plans in Vietnam, according
to official reports on the incident.

The starboard side of the ship sus-
tained damages, but according to the
press release it “may be repairable with

rninimal or no impact on the ship’s

schedule.”

According to unofficial reports,
damage was also done to student cabins
on the inside of the ship.

Pitt spokesman Ken Service was
unavailable to comment on the incident
yesterday evening.

Student debates issues with Black Action Society

BRENTIN MOCK

’ Staff Writer

The Black Action Society’s Tuesday
night meeting centered around Pitt fresh-
man Matt Schiros, whose response to Jay

-Dworin’s column, published in The Pitt

News last Week, caused a heated debate
between he and'Jay Dworin of BAS.

Schiros, who is white, submitted a
written response to Dwon'n’s editorial
printed in The Pitt News last Thursday. In
the letter, Schiros wrote, “When can I get
away with being racist toward you?” and
“The University should end‘ its ‘Black
Studies’ programs, unless they’re going to
enact a ‘White Studies’ program.” ’

Schiros e—mailed his letter to some
students, posted copies around campus
and handed them out at shuttle stops.

The letter eventually reached Dworin.
Intrigued by Schiros’ rebuttal, Dworin
phoned Schiros and proposed a public
debate, to which Schiros accepted.

At the debate, Schiros faced Dworin,
about 50 black students and the Steering
Committee of BAS. A

Dworin said he felt that the BAS gen-
eral body meeting served as a good venue
for such a problematic issue.

BAS Executive Secretary Courtney
Richardson handed out copies of Schiros’
e-mail as he began his speech in the
Wﬂliam Pitt Union Ballroom. As the

assembled crowd watched, Schiros read

portions of his letter aloud.

As he read, jaws dropped. Whispers
passed through the crowd, and some sat
uneasily in their chairs, shocked by
Schiros’ words.

When the audience had an opportuni-
ty to respond, hands rocketed up and stu-
dents rushed to the microphone. .

Although his face turned bright red,
Schiros seemed undeterred. He held his
ground, responding to nearly three hours
of student questions and comments.

BAS had to interrupt the heated’

debate so they could cover the rest of the
items on their agenda and adjourn the
meeting. After the meeting was oﬂicially
adjourned, discussion resumed.

Schiros’ premise was that race and
color no longer ‘matter. He said that the
only way racial equality can ever exist in

America is if race—blind policies are put
into place —,meaning no more privileges
for blacks such as aﬁimiative action.

The general consensus of the audience
was that race and color do matter. Some
said that the fact that Schiros is white is the

. reason why he enjoys certain privileges

and liberties blacks never receive. -
Dworin said he was pleased with the
outcome of the debate.
“It was exactly what. I expected,”

Dworin said. “I hope [the debate] and the
controversy it sparks helps blacks under-
stand the gravity of this matter if they
remain silent and apathetic.”

Schiros said he had similar intentions,
and added that he wasn’t looking for pub-
licity.

“Certainly, I wasn’t looking for atten-
tion. I wanted to open a volatile matter to

Resident assistants banged on doors as
students slowly stumbled out of bed Others
rushed out of the showers, and everyone was
directed toward the exit as the ﬁre alarm
sounded.

But Tony Velazquez and his roommate
were at least two Tower B residents who
were still sound asleep in their room during
what was only a drill.

According to many past and present I

students living in residence halls, sleeping
through or ignoring ﬁre drills and false
alarms is a common event — sometimes
because people fail to hear the alarm, and
other times because students do not take
them seriously. .

A ﬁre drill occurs when the students

_ must evacuate. It is an unannounced practice I

of what should happen in case of ﬁre.
Students must evacuate the building or face
a ﬁne from the University.

The orange signs placed on the build-
ings indicate a ﬁre test. The testing is done to
ensure the systems are working, and stu-
dents do not have to evacuate during the
tests. '

Because some students are so noncha-

lant about ﬁre drills and their own safety,

there" is a possibility that if a real ﬁre
occurred, it would be handled poorly. and
end in disaster.

“I remember having drills and some-
times we never heard them,” said Velazquez,
who is now a junior living off campus. “So
if it actually did occur, it might have taken a
long time to evacuate.

Other students who say they hear the _

alarms still don’t evacuate because they
assume that it is a false alarm.

Colleen Lamb, a sophomore who lived
in Lothrop last year said there were always
complications in the boiler room of her
building, which caused the alarm to go 0
every morning. -

“I would get up the ﬁrst couple times,
but then I’d just go back to bed” Lamb said
“Nobody ever knocked on my door.”

Now, a Brackenridge resident, Lamb

saidthatitisstillraretoseemorethan20'

people outside her building during a drill.

“If anything was to really happen, peo-
ple wouldr1’t know any better than to go
back to bed,” she said _

Dan_Feinbe1g, a junior, recalled a simi-
lar embarrassing experience from his fresh-
man year in Tower B, after waking up to a
ﬁre alarm.

“I was so groggy that I wandered down-
stairs in my boxers, but I was the only one
there,” Feinberg said “It’s kind of like the
boy who cried wolf— the alarm used to go
off so frequently that everyone thought it
was f .”

Velazquez said that he would leave the
building during alarms in the beginning of
the year, but after that he did not think it was
necessary.

“Nobody ever made us leave,” he said.
“The RA never walked around.”

But luckily there have not been many
actual ﬁre emergencies.

Stephen Sivulich, the assistant director
of residence life, said that in the last three
years he has worked here, there hasonly
been one ﬁre, which was the result of a
mishap involving an extension cord.

I “That particular ﬁre happened last
year,” Sivulich said. “And because of the
quick action of the RA, nobody was hurt, but
the room was almost completely destroy .”

Sivulich said that although there is only
one ﬁre evacuation drill conducted in resi-
dence halls every semester by residence life,
the housing service frequently tests the
alarm system Orange notices posted in
dorms are reminders to students on the days
of testing, when students don’t have to evac-
uate

‘Prohibiting smoking, air conditioners, .
halogen light ﬁxtures, any type of ﬂamrna- I’

ble item such as incense, and most types of

extension cords, hot plates, or cooking items »
-other than microwaves are other measures

taken by residence life to ensure safer resi-
dence halls. ' '
However, Jessica Ariff, who lived in.

Tower A during her freshman year, said that
most people she knew broke these rules at

one time or another.

“I don’t think anything life 
came out of these rules,” she said " I A

Lamb agrees. '

“I know people who burn candles, but I
never ‘think anything will catch on ﬁre,”
Lamb said. A

But Sivulich warned that residence life I

is constantly reminding RAs to inspect ﬁre
safety hazards which should be dealt with
immediately. , . I

And Sivulich said that if the ﬁre chief

was notiﬁed of students who failedto eVac- A
uate during ﬁre drills, he could ﬁne them for i

‘Things run relatively smooth, we
occasionally get an attitude,” Sivulich said

“Every time an alarm goes o_i£ you should I

reactlikeitis’arealﬁre.”

_ ignoring University policy. ‘ ’ V

After deadly ﬁres like the oneat Seton L

Hall University in New Jersey lastyear, 

Sivulich has been bombarded with questions]

from faculty and staff about ﬁre safety pro-
cedures at Pitt. I

“We’ve been fortunate at Pitt, because I
we constantly do drills and we train the RAs ~

to react very quickly,” Sivulich said "Ihat’s

our secret.Ithinkthatiwhatwe’redoingisp'
good and we have to keep doing it, but we .« s
also have to make students aware of the ’

importance of ﬁre safety.”

Especially now, after a ﬁre in.NorthA’

Oakland killed a student, others lookback '
on their years in the residence halls and .

admit that they should have been more con- “ 7

cerned for their safety.

“It was never something I really thought a

about,” Velazquez said. “But now I know
my life would have been in danger during a
real ﬁre.”

Something’s brewing  A

DON SZEJK JR.

Staff Writer A

Gary Johnson’s dark eyes grew wide as
he spoke. He stroked his neatly trimmed
goatee and ﬁshed around in the shopping
bag a moment before coming up with a
neatly labelled bottle. All the while, he ﬁd-
geted like a child. , ‘

, “Just wait until you try this,” Johnson
said. ‘This is my best batch yet!”

It seems odd to see a grown man this
excited, but Johnson explained that he
always gets excited about * the things he
loves. And if there is one thing Johnson
loves, it’s beer.

More speciﬁcally, he loves his own
beer, which he brews in his kitchen at home
in McKees‘ Rocks, Pa. Johnson, a former
Pitt student, is one of a large number of hob-
byists here, and across the nation, who reg-
ularly take to their kitchens to cook up their
own home brew.

Johnson has been making his own ales
and lagers for a little more than a year. He
has always liked the_ taste of beer, especially
the more expensive German imports. .

He ﬁrst heard about home brewing
fromra ﬁiend, and after a sampling of this

. ﬁiend’s beer, he was hooked.

Johnson explained that he likes to make
his own beer because he can have it his way.
Each batch of brew can be carefully blend-
ed to get exactly the ﬂavor he likes.

“It’s an artistic outlet for me,” Johnson
said. “The process itself is interesting, and I
can tweak the recipes to get it just how I like
it.” .

According to Johnson, the process is
simple, but not easy. All beeris essentially
made from four basic ingredients: barley or
wheat malt, hops, yeast and water.

-Malt, which isrthe sugar from grain, is
ﬁrst cooked with water, then hops are added
for ﬂavoring and aroma. After the mixture is
cooked for an hour, it is rapidly cooled, and
yeast is added. The mixture is then trans-
ferred to a_ larger container, where it is
allowed to ferment. When fermentation, is
complete, the beer is bottled and aged. Most
of Johnson’s beer is ready within three

weeks. _ '
_ The basic ingredients are always the
same, but beer makers can adjust the ﬂavor,
color and alcohol content of their brew by
adjusting the recipes. Many brewers get
together to compare notes and share secrets
about creating their favorite beer styles. I
“There is a sense of community that I
like,” Johnson said. “I’m always ﬁred up
when I come across something new, or taste
a great beer.” I
Justin Crimone of Shadyside agrees. A

former chef who is now a student at Pitt,-

Crimone is famous among his friends fora
creation he calls “Black Death.”

His potent brew is more likea wine I
' than a traditional beer. The heavy elixir,

without any noticeable carbonation, is
meant to be sipped as an after-dinner drink
‘There is something special about shar-
ing something you’ve made with your
friends, especially if they’re beer people,”
Crimone said. . I .

_ Pride seems to beacommonthreadthat
connects home brewers. Jon Benedict, the
owner and sole employee of. South Hills
Brewing and Supply Company 

' Greentree, Pa., says his customers are gen-

erally well—educated and well-informed
individualists who bring a measure of pride
to everything they do. n 
‘‘They’re the kind of people that want
to make a beer that suits them instead ofa

beer that some ad agency wants them -to

drink,” Benedict said.
,..Benedict has ‘operatedhis store since

_ 1994 and can testify to the strength of home

brewing as a hobby. He said that the home
brew fad of the mid—’90s has leveled off and‘
left behind a core group of dedicated beer
folks. He likes to call them “Iifers.”

Johnson is one of these “lifers.” As hei I
held up a full glass and" admired the clarity,

and color of his lager, he spoke of his
German heritage and a great-uncle who
used to brew special beers for family gath-
erings and holidays. The old recipes are

gone, but Johnson plans to keep the spirit .
_ alive.

(“I want to pass it down to my
nephews,” he said. “As soon as tl1ey’re old
enough, I want to teach them.” , /-

BAS

discussion and I think I created an avenue
where more than one opinion could be
heard by the community.” —

Schiros admitted that when he first
read Dworin’s editorial he automatically
thoughtit was the work of a racist in the
same vein he thinks Louis Farrakhan or
Malcolm X to be racists.

After the debate, Schiros said he felt
Dworin may not hate all white people but
deﬁnitely holds some racist views.

\‘ Schiros said he learned some new ,

things at the debate; he mistakenly stated
in his letter that black organizations

FROM PAGE 1-

receive a “full third of the total activities
budget.” ‘ ‘ 
, Dworin found out the ﬁgure was actu-
ally closer to 10 percent.
Schiros admitted that he was appre-

hensive about the meeting, but hopes to 

have another, more public debate with
Dworin.

“I received 20 threatening phone '

over the weekend. I knew I was going into
a hostile environment. But, at the same

time I know people are rational,” he said. A
‘‘It’s not an issue of black or white,”g

he said. “I’m not trying to pit myself
against the black community. Overall, “I
just want people to know that there’s more
than one opinion on“this.” I

Don’t let superstitions ruin
your Friday the 13th fun  

Even those of us who aren’t
raving triskaidekaphobics may feel
a small wave of nervous apprehen-
sion when looking at the calendar
today. Not only is it Friday the
13th, it is the spooky month of
October, and if that’s not enough to
make your heart race a bit, it’s also
a full moon.

You could stay in bed all day,
quivering in terror, just waiting for
the 24 hours to pass. That would be
the cowardly approach.

Or you could be brave. You
could face your fears head on,
intentionally break every supersti-
tion  and leave the world a better
place as a result.

Walk under a ladder. This
won’t be hard with all the con-
struction going on. Don’t just hurry’
by; linger under the ladder for a
while and kindly greet the con-
struction guys working on the job.

If you see a black cat, don’t cry
or panic. Pick up the kitty and
caress its fur lovingly. If you are
feeling particularly deﬁant and you
consider yourself a true friend to
wildlife, visit a local animal shelter
and make a special effort to
embrace all the kitties that are of a
dark persuasion.

Smash your mirror as a symbol
of how our society places too much

emphasis on appearances. For the
rest of the day concentrate on culti-
vating your inner beauty.

Even if it doesn’t rain, carry an
umbrella and open it indoors fre-
quently. To make this worthwhile,
declare it Umbrella Maintenance
Day and wash that umbrella down,
stripping off layers of grime and
acid rain.

Finally, the bravest, most
rebellious folks should set their
watches to military time and meet
at 13:13 on the 13th ﬂoor of the
Cathedral of Learning. Bring your
ladders, black cats, broken mirrors
and opened umbrellas.

We will mix all of the stuffin a
giant cauldron to make a mysteri-
ous, potent brew. To make it tasty,
we will throw in 13 shots of
Fruitazza fruit slushies from
Eddie’s.

Symbolically spitting in the

face of superstition, we will drink
the brew while cackling loudly and
dancing the monster mash.

Still a bit scared? Still tempted
to skip classes and spend all day
hiding under the covers? _ ‘

Then take an example from
The Pitt News. We certainly aren’t
afraid. . -

We’ve taken 13 paragraph
here to prove it.

If there’s one thing wrong with America’s

Unfortunately, some folks do actually seem
to think kids don’t get enough television at home
and need it pumped into the classroom Hence,
now we have something called Channel One
Television, beamed into classrooms nationwide
and watched by 8 million students daily. It teach-
es students lessons that we shouldn’t want taught
to anyone, let alone those most susceptible to
such teachings. .- ,
Although we need to teach American chil-

when our schools offer junk food promotions?

teachers do their job when television is
intruding into their activities and depriving them
of valuable instructional time?

Although we need to teach American kids to
avoid peer pressure and be happy without relying
on outside sources of gratiﬁcation, Channel One’s
commercials teach otherwise. Neil Postman and
Steve Powers write that “[t]here are no simple or
fast solutions to life’s important problems; specif-
ically, there is no chemical that can make you
desirable: attractiveness must come from within.”

Christian tradition, is the exact opposite of what
almost all commercials teach

In other words, “Thou shalt not” directly
conﬂicts with “Just Do It.” But, we should follow
the Bible rather than the gospel of Nike. When
kids watch Channel One, they get a_ full day’s

151' .1 s
Graham or Stewart?

Too close to call

The Pittsburgh Steelers have had
enough problems in the past few seasons to
last head coach Bill Cowher a lifetime.

In the third game of the 0-3 start, start-
ing quarterback Kent Graham injured his
thumb, and was unable to play against the
Jacksonville Jaguars and New York Jets,
both road contests the Steelers won.

In his place, Kordell Stewart led the
Pittsburgh offense to 24 and 20 points in
those two victories, while the defense gave
up just 16 points combined.

Stewart has had numerous poor show-
ings at Three Rivers Stadium, and with
Graham healthy, Cowher immediately
named Graham as the starting quarterback
for Sunday’s home game against the
Cincinnati Bengals.

There are numerous ways to analyze
the Steelers’ QB situation, so I’ll handicap
the “race” for you.

Numbers — It’s very simple. Graham
is 0-3 as the starter with losses to
Baltimore, Cleveland and Tennessee,
including two of those at Three Rivers
Stadium. Stewart is 2-0 as the Steelers
quarterback after beating the previously
unbeaten Jets last week. Advantage —
Stewart

Passing ability —— There’s little that
Stewart can do to shed the image of the
awful passer most Pittsburghers think he is.
The facts speak for themselves: Stewart
can’t read defenses, can’t ﬁnd the open
receiver and is inconsistent. Graham has
shown that he can be as accurate as former
Steelers QB Neil O’Donnell was. If you
want to make the argument that O’Donnell
threw two interceptions in Super Bowl
)O{X, check with Corey Holliday and the
receiving routes he was running.
Advantage — Graham

Athleticism — If you have to ask this,
you’re not a Steelers fan. Stewart is not

'“ T Although Schmidt didn’t reveal who
thought it would be fun for her, she was
quick to credit her high school coaches,

. Gerry Kiple and Dana Dobbs, for actually

making cross country and track enjoyable.
- “[Kiple] helped me out a lot,” Schmidt
said.

Dobbs, who is deaf, provided a great
deal of inspiration for Schmidt.

“He was really motivational,”
Schmidt said. “He helped me prepare to
run. I learned a lot about running and see-
ing things in a different way from him.”

During her senior year of high school,
Schmidt was injured and started having
doubts about whether she would be able to
run in college. She ended up making the
Pitt team in a roundabout way.

“I was having trouble getting every-

thing back together,” Schmidt said. “And it

was really frustrating for me.”
Schmidt had considered an offer from

_ East Carolina University, but taking her

injury into consideration and her desire to
attend an excellent physical therapy
school, Schmidt turned her attention to
Pitt

“I decided to come to Pitt, because I
liked their academics,” Schmidt said.
“They have a really good [physical thera-
py] program here.”

' Schmidt was set academically, but the
Pitt track program was not aware of her
athletic ability, until a call from the East
Carolina coach to former Pitt distance

' coach Dave Sobel let them in on the secret.

Not too long after that, Schmidt said,
she received a call from Sobel and was a
member of the team.

Even though she wasn’t conventional-
ly recruited, Schmidt said, ‘‘I’m glad that
I’m here.” _

However, Schmidt hit a stumbling

failed to turn a double—p1ay in the top of the
ninth inning and the Yankees hung in long
enough to tie the score at nine. That’s when
destiny called upon the number eight hitter
in the Pirates lineup in the bottom of the
ninth, a defensive second baseman batting
.270.

Mazeroski stepped to the plate and
faced New York’s closer, Ralph Terry. Terry
threw Maz a ball for the ﬁrst pitch, but the '
second one was right down the middle.
Mazeroski swung the bat with effortless
force and watched as the ball saﬂed towards
the 406 mark in left—center ﬁeld. When the
ball cleared the wall and a dumbfounded-
Yogi Berra, the stadium erupted. ’

“I was staring right at Mazeroski when

.Mazeroski was staring at the home run. It

was right in front of me, all the way out,”
Emanuele remembers. “I was just ecstatic, it
was the greatest, the people in,Oakland just
had a party. It was thebiggestparty that I’d
ever been to in my life.” _

The party spread from Oakland down
to Market Square and the rest of the Golden
Triangle. The ﬂood of celebrators forced the
police to close off the roads that led into the \
city.

“I was in high school and lived in
Dormont,” said a Pirates fan ‘who goesby
the name of Huddy. “A ﬁiend of mine and I .
hitchhiked since the buses weren’t running .
and got a ride down to route 51. We just
walked into town right down the white line
of the Liberty Tunnels. It was a madhouse.”
