Not all finals during finals week

Philip Bombara

’ Some Pitt students will take their

ﬁnal exams in many classes this
week, although they wonit.beofL.—
ﬁcial in the eyes of Pitt’s admin-
istration;

Those tests listed as the of-

ﬁcial ﬁnals, or “ﬁnal examina- ‘

tions” on a course’s syllabus must"

be given during Pitt’s scheduled ‘

finals week. Juan Manfredi, vice
provost for undergraduate stud-
ies, said Pitt’s Ofﬁce of the Reg-

1 istrar schedules all ﬁnals.

“If a course syllabus includes

"a ﬁnal examination, it must be

given as scheduled by the reg-
istrar’s ofﬁce and not at other
times to allow for the students
to prepare for other class ac-
tivities and examinations, and
to minimize schedule conflicts,
even if the faculty member and
all students in a course agree to
such a change,” Manfredi said in
an e—mail. .

He went on to say that other

"late semester examinations,

which he deﬁned as “anything

which is not a final,” are set by

« departments or individual pro-

fessors as they see ﬁt. These tests
should be indicated in the course
syllabus, Manfredi said.

However, if professors do not
have official ﬁnalsscheduled on
the syllabus, they determine the
testing schedule for the semester
— which could include a de facto
ﬁnal exam this week.

For example, one professor,_

who wished to remain unnamed,
said that this year, his last exam
was scheduled for this week rath-
er than during ﬁnals week.

“As part of my ﬁnal, I require
my students to attend an event
and then review it, and being that
the schedule of the event varies
from year to year, it sometimes
happens that it falls outside of ﬁ-
nals week. So this year happened
to be one of the instances itvfalls
outside of the University slated

time,” he said during a recent i

interview.

_ Additionally, the professor
found that in previous years
when this same conflict" arose,
students typically performed
better on the ﬁnal examination

Service cuts
could affect
Pitt’s Port
Authority
contract  

Andrew Shull
Staﬂ’ Writer

Pitt’s negotiations for a new con-
tract with the Port Authority will
likely be affected by the recent
service cuts, which could change
student transportation fees.

When the Port Authority cut
its service by 15 percent last
month, it might hurt students’
ability to get around. This will
likely come up at the negotiating
table, as Pitt’s contract with the
Port Authority expires in June of
next year.

Pitt officials have said that
they do not yet know how much

the cuts have affected student

transportation.

The current contract gives stu-
dents, faculty and staff unlimited
rides on Port Authority buses, the
rail system and the inclines.

More ‘than 20,000 of Pitt’s
29,000 graduate and undergradu-
ate students live of‘f—campus, and
many use Port Authority services

to travel to and from campus.

The money for Pitt’s contribu-

‘ tion to the Port Authority comes _,

from the $90-per—semester
transportation fee that all stu-
dents pay. That fee has remained
unchanged since the 2006-2007
academic year.

Pitt spokeswoman Patricia
White said in an e—mail that

Pitt exceeds recycling goals

Shae’ Felicien
Staﬂ’ Writer

In competition this year, Pitt was
in the top half of the Big East and
beat its goals —— for recycling.

The annual eight-week compe-
tition called RecycleMania drew
in 630 college campuses nation-
wide and concluded on April 2.
Together, the schools collected
over 91 million pounds of.recy-
clables and organic materials.

The competition officially be-
gan on Feb. 6, after a two week
preliminary period.

Concluding its third year par-

ticipating in the competition, Pitt .

was able to exceed its goals for

V the year.

This is the third year Pitt en-
tered RecycleMania —\ an an-
nual recycling competition that
stretches across more thanA400
colleges in the U.S. and parts of
Canada — but a new twist to the
competition means Pitt gathered
more than the usual cardboard
and plastic.

This marked the first year that
Pitt participated in the Food Ser-
vice Organics category, using the

new composterlocated in Market ,

Central to reduce feodwaste.
V “It was a benchmarking year
"for the compost category, but I
believe it will greatly enhance our
results in the future,” said Allison
Plummer, a junior and student
sustainability coordinator for
Pitt’s Housing Department.

She said that a goal of 12
pounds of recycled goods per

student was set at _the start of j
‘the competition. . .

. The,Re°YC1¢M3“l3"W¢b5i§‘3z’

linked on my.pitt._edu, ‘detailed-

this as four pounds of paper,
seven pounds of corrugated card-
board, and one pound of bottles
and cans per student. ’

Pitt recycled 14.72 pounds of

combined materials per student,
more than two pounds past the
goal‘ that Pitt set in the beginning
of the contest.

In the category of Grand
Champion, Pitt placed second
out of four schools from the Big
East, just behind the University
of Louisville. Those ﬁgures gave
Pitt a ranking of 160 out of 289
schools in the category.

According to the RecycleMa-
nia website, “The Grand Cham-
pion category combines trash

admitted that he does not recycle
on a regular basis and wasimsure
of what RecycleMania was. How-
ever, he did note the importance
of recycling.

“It is important for students

V to recycle because we all play a

bring out that outcome,” Johnson

said. “Now I just‘ need to remind’

Successful colleges and uni-
versities _in this category dem-

_ The RecycleMania website
said that Pitt students, faculty
and staff recycled 584,407

. pounds of material. -

Plummer hoped that the Uni-
versity would score higher in the
category of waste minimization,
which aims to reduce the amount
of municipal solid waste pro-
duced per person. ’

Sophomore Filipe Silvestre,

petition through_his resident as-

 recycling as a ‘.‘simple” one and.

encouraged others to take part in
it and “develop good habits.”

LARP club features

The club’s president is an intellec— ‘

' tual from 18th-century England.

The adviser is an Arab astrono-
mer from the Islamic Golden Age,
and they meet with 10 to 15 other
“immortals” Friday nights on the

Cathedral’s ground floorto act .

across the world‘.

They are LARPers, and/their '
A club is probably not at all like

whatlyou’re picturing.

Live- Action Role'Playi.ng is a
game that_has been played world-
wide since the mid-199 Os, and
the chapter at Pitt became an ‘offi-
cial student organization just last
semester — although people with
no University affiliation can still
play with the group. In it, each

‘player creates a character, then

plays that character within the‘

game. Each character has a back
story where somewhere along -the
line, he or she was turned into an
immortal vampire. .

There are few dramatic cos-
tumes, no prop weapons or
battles and the club strictly for-
bids any physicality within the
game.

“It’s a game where basically
we write, tell and act out a story

all at the same time,”.said Chuck -

Werner, the club’s advisor and a
Pitt faculty member who works
in alumni relations.

. Club members are attracted
to LARPing for various reasons‘,
Werner said. Some peopleenjoy
games like"“Dl1ngeons and Drag-

 ons” an__d are more interested’ in

. the fantasyqspect oﬁthe game. 1
Others are from writing or lit-. ,
erary backgrounds‘and_ enjoy '

meticulously crafting their char-

, acters’ stories. Some members

like the theatrics of it, and some
-— butcertainly not all ‘—- enjoy

‘ putting together costumes for

the game. .
‘ ,‘.‘As dramatic and overreach-

ing as it ‘sounds, it’s really run- »

of-the-mill, boring stuff,” Werner
said. . -
. Despite that tepid endorse-

V ment of the game, Werner said he

advises the club because he has
been playing the game since he
was a student at Carnegie Mellon

- University. He said he still plays

the game and that he stepped into
the role as adviser because of his
extensive experience.

“It’s about more than vam-
pires,” club president Dan Mur-
phy said, “It’s about what you do
when you lose your humanity.”

Murphy, who is a ‘senior his-
tory major, plays the character of
a “Faux Intellectual” who lived in

England during the 1750s. Mur-

phy said his character decided

to become a vampire because he"

thought being immortal would
give him a chance to reach his
full intellectual power.

Players reported that the
game’s intrigue comes from the
social, political and moral impli-
cations of living as a vampire in
a human world. - - ‘

Port Authority 4 1

Pitt’s agreement with thepPort Authority
‘included “language acknowledging that
the compensation paid by the University
is in consideration for a certain level and
type of service.”

‘ She said in the e—mail that Pitt would
ask for a reduction in compensation if it
discovers that the service cuts did have
an effect on overall~University ridership,
although she said Pitt has yet to do a formal
study on the impact of those cuts.

She said that Pitt would try to. determine
whether the Pitt community was affected
by the cuts and ask for lower compensation
if it had been. '

Jim Ritchie, a spokesman for the Port
Authority, said that the issue of lower fees
was something both sides expected to ad-
dress while negotiations begin on a new
contract.

According to a report the Port Author-
ity sent to the state legislature in 2009,
the ﬁve-year contract that Pitt negotiated
called for a 15 percent increase in fees ev-
ery year, causing Pitt’s fees to the Port
Authority to doubleover the five years of

cuts v

the contract. .
In the report, Pitt initially paid just un-

Jim llitchiez ‘

    

der $3.9 million, and CMU paid $881,000
in their first years. ‘It did not include in-
formation on the 2010 compensation, al-
though it would be about $6.81‘million,
according to the 15 percent increases in
Pitt’s agreement.

Carnegie Mellon University — which
uses the same bus routes as Pitt — negoti-

A ated a similar contract with the Port Au-

thority, except with a smaller annual pay-
ment, and the same percentage increases
over the same time period.

 

  Pitt could push for lower prices in
light of service  

Neither University commented on
whether they are currently seeking lower

payments to the Port Authority, although
Ken Walters —-who works in the media
relations office at CMU — said that the

university does discuss service issues regu-

larly with the Port Authority.

Whether Pitt will lower its fees to the
Port Authority -7 and if those savings will
be passed onto its students —— remains to
be seen over the course of the negotia-

tions. . V .
“This isn’t something that will unfold

in the next few days,” Ritchie said-

this, more experienced players will always
be happy to help people who are unfamiliar
with the relevant literature: . '

He also said that knowledge of the nov-
elsis not required to be successful in the
game. The story line of the game itself is
completely different, as it is one that is
created and acted out liveat the games.

However,cMurphy would caution per-
spective players not to show up assuming
that their game bares similarities to vam-
pires like the ones from “Twilight.” He
said that it is a gameof personal horror,
not romance. ' .

Murphy explained that the -personal.

horror stems from going from being a
human to being a monster and ﬁghting
within one’s self to retain one’s human-

ity. He made the distinction that although ‘

vampires need_t0 drink blood to survive,
they do not necessarily need human blood
to survive. _

a Not succumbing to that temptation is
part of the game. That, plus the intriguing
politics, social dynamics and elaborate
back stories all make this a hobby that is
much bigger than simply acting out vam-
pire fantasies. - ‘ '

Faueebook only
complicates

dating  

ollege students have
reached a new level of des-

peration and laziness.

MBA graduates from Columbia
University developed a Facebook
application called iWould that al-
lows use_rs to create a “to-do” list
of people on their friend lists.

The point of the appiis to

cross—reference- users’ lists to
find matches — ensuring that
both parties are interested and
no one gets rejected.

“The app aims "to rule out’

the potential for rejection with
its provision that if the inter-
est isn’t mutual, your crush will
never know,” the Huffington Post
reported.

Although new technologies
often make hooking up easier, we
think that some might _actually
make dating more complicated.

A 2009 Pew Research Center
Study on social isolation and new
technology found that “The use
of social networking services
to maintain core networks is
highest among 18-22-year—olds.
Thirty percent of 18-22-year-olds
use a social networking service
to maintain contact with 90 per-
cent or more of their core inﬂu-
entials.”

Social networking is great

for connecting, but we just

don’t think it’s that great for ro-
mance.

There’s something — dare we
say —— magical about the period
of.courtship before dating. The
time of anticipation where you
try to analyze whether or not
your dream date likes you or
not, Sure, there’s some mystery
involved, but that’s part of the
fun. Rejection is a crucial.ingre-

client in the romance stew that‘
makes scoring a date all the more

- satisfying. _

Additionally, we aren’t con-
vinced that iWould eliminates all
rejection, anyway.

Because Facebook states
who downloaded «what applica-
tion, knowing that your crush
has downloaded it will let you
know whether they are interested
in you. If he or she has the app

and you haven’t been notiﬁed —

of a match, he or she obviously
wouldn’t shun, shag or marry
you. Well, we guess the shun part
is debatable.

We also think people need to
be careful with how much infor-
mation they give over to a social
networking site. You already

tell Facebook your name, date.

of birth, e-mail, location, sexual
orientation, relationship status
and maybe even your phone num-
ber. Are you now also willing to
provide it with a list of which
people on your list you like as
more than a friend?

And although we hate to bring
this up for fear it will give people
ideas, we have to note that this
would be the ultimate thing to
hack into when someone leaves
his or her Facebook open. One
minute you’re chatting up that
cute girl you work with, the next
minute you’re being notiﬁed that
you have a match — and it’s your
stepmom.

So to conclude this editorial,
we’d like to tell college students
to stop making dating and hook-
up apps and websites. Most of
us are horny or looking for love.
All you have to do is get off your
computer and come find us. I

You might have heard of the
Gang of Eight, which is the col-
lective term for the eight leaders

the leaders from each party of both

the Senate and the House, as well

as the chairs and ranking minority

And who could forget “The
Apple Dumpling Gang” — featur-
ing two bumbling criminals and a
posse of adorable, precocious chil-
dren destined to inhabit the depths
of the Disney Vault, where they
are forced to sustain themselves
on Disney Princess lollipops and
“Lizzie McGuire” reruns.

These gangs are often highly
specialized to meet the challenge of

a speciﬁc problem or task. A lot of .
. times, it’s the fastest, most efficient

way to get something done.

So I’ve been thinking about put-
ting together my own fantasy gang
— a gang comprised of politicians
whom I personally favor — which

will rally to tackle an issue very.

dear to me, by instigating a na-
tionwide assault on grammatically
incorrect street signs. _,
We’ve all seen them: the mis-
used apostrophes (or should I say,
f‘apostrophe’s”?), the incorrect

spellings,the missing hyphens, _
the inconsistent capitalization‘. ,

For decades, these ,n}qn_st_ro_sities

have plagued this country; but now

it’stime we say,‘ “No more!”

carefully choosing the members of .

group cohesion. I need people‘ who
will balance each other out .— peo-
ple who have different perspectives
but will ultimately get along. And
I need people who know how to
Party-

After much deliberation, I’m
quite sure I’ve managed to draft
the greatest gang on~Earth.

The members include Speaker
of the Housejohn Boehner, R- Ohio,
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,

Russian Prime Minister Vladimir ' .. ‘

Putin, New York Times columnist
Gail Collins, his eminence Kevin

Bacon and Pikachu (on a part-time '

basis only).
Each member of the gang has a

_ very speciﬁc role to play.

I’ve mostly given Boehner a
spot in the gang simply because
I owe it to him. I’ve made more
Boehner jokes than the number

of times Boehner has cried shame- g

lessly in public e which is a lot.
Boehner is alsoa conservative; a

would trust to make actual gram-
matical decisions, and they’re also
my personal heroes. So mostly,this
is just an excuse -for me to hang out
with them as much as I want.
Bacon, of course, will take care
of the manual ‘labor. He’ll be the

one physicallyremoving the er- -

roneous signs and constructing
the correct ones in their place.

‘While doing this, he will perform

select numbers -from “Footloose”
to much applause. The addition of
Bacon to the gang is crucial, be-
cause it will catapult all members’
Bacon Numbers — including my

own —- to a 1, making each of us
key links in Bacon chains and fre-
quent participants on The Oracle
of Bacon.

Putin will be’ our muscle. He’ll
take care of any dissenters using
special techniques that took years

for him to master in the Siberian ,

tundra. To conceal his identity, Pu-
tin will wear a Richard Nixon mask
and speakthrough a vocoder.

As for Pikachu, his role in the
gang is purely for image. He’ll be
the star —— the face of the move-
ment! All across the country his
sweet Pokemon face will adorn bill-
boards, commercials, McDonald’s

Happy Meal bags — and all other
sorts of propaganda —— that read
“Pikachu, I choose correctly punc-
tuated street signs!”

We’ll probably have him do an
R&B cover of Redbone’s classic
“Come and Get Your Love,” but
instead we’ll call it “Comma Get

Your Love.” The music videopwill -

feature Chris Brown.

Our ultimate goal is the com-
plete and utter annihilation of ev-
ery single grammatically incorrect
sign, ever. First Pennsylvania, then
—— the world.

tion of pests using every means
of termination at one’s disposal
—— including poison, brute force
and hatred. Ruthless in its execu-
tion, the Sarah Reagle offers no
mercy. Every n1isworded sign must
be destroyed.‘

Of course, some people might
think that the Gang of Five and
One-Half is frivolous or unneces-
sary. But then again, so is “Mulli-

But it was. And I know that
this is entirely specious logic, but
if there is a place for “Mulligrubs”

FOOD COLUMN

Simkin: Tea parties not justfor the British

Sarah Simkin
Columnist

April 29 is a date that will have
international signiﬁcance — not
just because it’s the penultimate
day of ﬁnals, but also because
Prince William of Wales is marry-
ing Kate Middleton. What better
way to celebrate both occasions
than a tea party?

Tea is a far broader subject
than I could hope to cover in
a food column. For the sake of
simplicity and tradition, then,
we’ll conﬁne ourselves to black
tea options, neglecting the many

v ﬁne white, green and herbal va-

rieties.The classic options are
Darjeeling, widely hailed as the
champagne of teas for its deli-

cate taste, Earl Grey and English
Breakfast. I would also highly
recommend plain PG Tips tea -
wildly popular in the United King-
dom and available at the Giant
Eagle Market District and some
Indian grocery stores.

You’ll want to provide guests
with cream or milk and sugar —
I don’t actually know of anyone
who takes their tea with lemon,

. but I suppose you could prepare

for that contingency, as well.

As for food, ﬁnger sandwiches
aren’t at all dissimilar from regu-
lar sandwiches except for their
presentation: crusts cut off, sliced
into triangles. So basically like
lunch-when you were 5, but now
with elegance. - - . ~ »

There are a few classic ingredi-
ent varieties you could attempt.

I’d recommend making at least .

two for variety’s sake, if you’re at-
tempting to put together an actual
tea party. Chicken, tuna and egg
salad are probably concoctions

you’re already familiar with mak— ,

ing that will serve as excellent
ﬁllings on white or wheat bread.
Smoked salmon and cream cheese
or cucumber is another favorite,
as well as watercress and butter.
Is it a tea party without scones?
Of course it is: A tea party is a
state of mind and has no formal
requirements other than perhaps
tea and friends. But you’re prob-
ably expecting a scone recipe, and
I’m.loath to disappoint. j
r Hence, for basic plain scones,
combine 3 cups flour with 1/2 cup
sugar, 5 teaspoons of baking pow-
der and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Cut

‘' the other guy onstage,” he said referring to
the fact that he takes on Mercury’s persona
when he performs. _

Indeed, Mullen hardly views his perfor-
mances as his own accomplishments.

_ “The guy on stage is not the guy thatI am.
He is self—conﬁdent; an extension of myself,”
Mullen said.

Off the stage, as well, Mullen has been
asked to impersonate Mercury. Just recently,
for _instance, he ﬁnished working on aJapa-
nese commercial featuring his voiceover
impression of the singer.

Mullen said he is pleased with the ano-
nymity his alter-ego affords: When he isn’t
performing, he spendsftime with his wife

and four children, with all the privacy of a‘

regular civilization. _

Although he enjoys his off-time, Mullen
never tires of championing his band.

“It’s not just Justin Beiber and Hannah
Montana for kids,” Mullen said. Mullen said
that kids enjoy the show alongside their par-
ents, who might have seen Queen perform

Pitt takes series against Georgetown)

Ryan Samson I Senior Staff Photographer '

The Pitt baseball team defeated Georgetown in a doubleheader on Friday, but lost in the ﬁnal game on

V Sunday in Washington, D.C.

Dustin Gabler
Staff Writer

The Pitt baseball team won its
third-straight Big East series

over the weekend by taking two ‘

of three games over the George-
town Hoyas.

The heavy rains in Washington
,D.C., caused the weekend series to
be rescheduled to a doubleheader
on Friday and then the conclusion
game on Sunday. ‘

The "Panthers (21-18, 8-4 Big
East) improved to 6-0 in dou-
bleheader games this season by
winning both games on Friday.
After winning the series against
Georgetown, Pitt remained in
second place in the conference
standings behind Connecticut (22-

« 12, 10-2 Big East).

“Playing doubleheaders are
very tough, especially when
you are playing two nine-inning
games,” Pitt head coach Joe Jor-
dano said. “It is a long ‘day, but
there is nothing that we do differ-

ently to prepare or execute than..,

we do for a single game.”
But Pitt was unable to sweep

the last place Hoyas (19-19, 2-10 A

Big East) because ‘ofSunday’s lack
of offensive production.

Pitt 15 —- Georgetown 9

The Panthers’ bats exploded in
the opening game of the series.

John Schultz, Zach Duggan,
Kevan Smith, David Chester and
Rick Devereaux all hit home runs,
and Pitt started the game with

three runs in the top of the ﬁrstqi

inning.

[The scoring started quickly for
Pitt as Duggan homered the ﬁrst
at-bat of the game.

Three errors plagued the Pan-
thers in the bottom of the ﬁrst
inning, allowing Georgetown
to score four runs on only three
hits.

Smith’s.solo home run in the
third inning tied the game back

at Pitt and the captain of C.S.B. —
said that earning the chance to play
on the Petersen Events Center ﬂoor
fulﬁlls some early season goals;

“That’s been the main goal since
day one,” Wimberly said yesterday.
“That and to actually get a rematch
with the dental school.”

The dental school team — which
eliminated Wimberly and C.S.B. in
the Elite Eight last year — went on
to win the league championship.
Wimberly carried the loss with him
all season. V

“They beat us to prevent us from
going to the Final Fourion a very

controversial game—winning shot,”

Wimberly said.

 A-;Th;,e shot that would have won 
‘ the-gan_1e_for‘ C.S.B. was waved=off-
ﬁve minutes after the ﬁnal buzzer.

One big headline for Wimberly’s
team this season wasthe addition of

formerPittbasketballplayerAustin '

Wallace.

“He is just a great addition to the
squad,” Wimberly said. “Nobody
can really match his size, rebound-
ing or defense. He sets the tone on
D [defense] and we run our offense
through him when we can.”

Other than Wallace, C.S.B. has
another go-to guy for when it’s des-
perate for points —— Mario Reeves.
Unlike Wallace, Reeves gained his
reputation away from the Pete.

’ “People call him a legend up at
Trees. He’s instant offense,” Wim-
berly said. V V -

Wimberly is already strategiz-
ing for what he knows will be a

tough matchup against the dental

school. . '

’ “Weneed to rebound, we ‘

need get out to their shooters,”
Wimberly said. ‘,‘5I‘hey can shoot
from anywhere on the ﬂoor.”

' In the other semiﬁnal, the Bar-

bara Streisands will be taking on
the Vegetables. Similar to C.S.B.,
the Barbara Streisands were elimi-
nated by the dental school last year,
by losing to it in the ﬁnal round.

Pitt junior Vince Williams, who
plays for the Streisands, thinks
some of the team’s goals have al-
ready been accomplished. .

. “The main goal for our team was
to play in the Pete, to at least get to
the Final Four,” Williams said. “But
we want to win a championship.”

For the players on the Stre-
isands, playing in the Petersen.
Events Center will be a landmark
in itself. Junior Kirkjones —— Wil-

_ liams’ teammate -— said the team is

excited for the opportunity to play

in the building; - ‘ ‘ .

Williams agreed. _
T “I don’t think anyone on our
team has played on the Pete ﬂoor

yet,” Williams said.‘

nal Four at the Pete

Williams also said the team’s bal-
ance drives them forward, and that“
it’s hoping its ability to make adjust-
ments can take it all the way.

“We work together so well as a
team, it’s really just whoever has
the open shot shoots,” Williams
said. “If someone is messing up,,,.
nobody has a problem with taking
criticism. We’re really good at mak-
ing changes in the game.”

The members of the Stre-
isands have a lot of experience in
their starting ﬁve, which features
a complete lineup of players who‘

‘played varsity-level basketball in

high school. Over the course of its
9-0 season, Williamssaid the team
felt its conﬁdence growing.

“We feel that we have a, really

good shot to win it,” Williams said.—.

“We’ve been through many tests so
far, and we’ve played some tough
teams”;

Graham, Favre highlight of NewsyAward winners

-4

Greg Trietley

 

.. _ Another Pitt News year is coming to an end,

which means one thing: the Second Annual
Newsy Awards. l -

Ah, yes. The Newsy Awards. Something I
made up to reminisce about the collegiate jour-
nalism year that was —— a year of sweater vests,
octane and Tasers. '

The Robert U. Woodward Award for_]our-
nalistic Stones

This honor goes to The Lantern, Ohio State’s
student newspaper,.and writer Grant Freking.

Last month, The Lantern published Frek-
ing’s editorial “Give 'I‘ressel the Boot,” which

«called for the university to ax football coach

and sweater vest enthusiast Jim Tressel over
NCAA violations.

Freking basically went Tank Man on Ohio
State’s athletic department at atime when 'I‘res—
selwas dodging contrition with statements like,
“I apologize for the factIwasn’t able to ﬁnd the

ones to partner with to handle our difficult and

complex situation.” .

The Lantern let its stance be known: Tres-
sel’s smug narcissism was something it would
not tolerate.

Senior Staff Writer ~

The “Don’t Tase Me, Bro” Great Moment
in Taser History ‘ . — _

This past yearwas to Tasers what20o4was
to thundersticks. These days, videos of streak-
ing, drinking and gallivanting fans getting the
juice show up more often than a new “Saw”
movie. The second, and therefore last, resort of
overweight security guards —— after “running”
-— aTaser saga has three acts: 1) Fan does some-
thing dumb. 2) Fan gets zapped. 3) Discussion
about ethics surfaces of said zapping. ’ '

But ﬁnally, someone broke the monotony.
Police used a Taser on a man at PNC Park last
week. What could have been another ho—hum

“Don’t Tase Me” whine—fest took aturn for the . V
magical when, as city detective Francis Rende
' wrote in his report, “It had no effect on him.” '

The winner in all this is science. We have

The only thing that the Miami Heat’s wel-»

Brett Favre received this honbr last year,
but it’ll be a sunny day in Pittsburgh before
he wins another. This year, Pitt football coach
Todd Graham wins.

Remember the state of Pitt football back
injanuary when the Panthers ﬁred Michael
Haywood? Thankfully, someone as loquacious
as Graham stepped in to digthrough the rubble.
No one knows how good the team will be, but
he’s already given us the phrase “high-octane.”

But speaking of Favre

. Favre still lingers. He can’t take the hint.

He tags along when_you take your spouse to
a wine—tasting festival. He’s the third person
in a handshake. He’s the unwanted bassist of
The Doors. . ‘
. . . ._ Favre went fromfunny .t.o.sad. to furiny to
pathetic, but even “Family Guy” doesn’t stretch
ajoke out this long. I fully expect him on the
Pittsburgh Powerbyjuly and on the Washington
Redskins when the NFL (maybe) resumesplay‘
in September. G .

With that said, see you in the fall.

vereaux’s two-run homer. _'

Pitt gained two more runs in the ﬁfth
and three more in the ninth.

Pitt 13 — Georgetown 4

In_the second game on Friday, senior
pitcher Corey Baker broke Pitt’s record
for all-time wins, earning him his 22nd
victory.. v

“We are all very pleased that Corey broke ‘

the record,” Jordano said. “It is a testa-
ment to his hard work over four years. He
earned it.”

Baker will continue to add to the record
as he ﬁnishes his senior season with the
Panthers. . .

“It means a lot to me to break the re-
cord,” Baker said. “When I_ signed with Pitt,
I never would have imagined I would leave
here the all—time winning pitcher. Second

to a Big East Championship, it is-deﬁnitely ~

a great accomplishment.”
The Panthers jumped out to catch an
early lead, putting up ﬁve runs in the ﬁrst

runs in its only defeat of the weekend.
“We got impatient at the plate,” senior

Phil Konieczny said. ' -

“The guy was mixing up his pitches well,
and we swung at some bad pitches. We need
to get back to hitting our pitches and stay-
ing disciplined,” he said.‘

’ Looking for the sweep, Jordano sent
freshman Ethan Mildren to the mound.
Mildren pitched a complete game and al-
lowed three runs —- only one of which was
earned. I ' _

“Ethan pitched a phenomenal game to-
day,”Jordano said. “He deserved better.”

Jordano has rotated his third starter
for weekend series throughout the season.
Mildren got the nod this weekend.  . ‘

“We switched our rotation this weekend
and we will continue with it against Rutgers

‘ on a short week,”.]o"rdano said. _

With two outs in the third inning, Mil-
dren forced a ground-ball. Second baseman
Travis Whitmore committed an error on

The early ﬁve runs gave Baker the cush-
ion he needed. Baker pitched six innings,
allowing 11 hits, butheld the Hoyas to only

. four runs, one unearned.

“Baker pitched as well Saturday as he has
all year,” Jordano said. “It was good to 'see
him getting back into his rhythm.”

i ' “This weekend I felt really comfortable
on the mound which I hadn’t felt in my last
few starts,” Baker said. “I think I just hit a
midseason slump that most good players
go through, and I took a step in the right

- direction the past weekend.”

Pitt tacked on two runs in the third,
fourth and sixth innings to widen its lead
over the Hoyas. . _

A single run in both the eighth and ninth
innings was enough to increase Pitt’s run

‘ total to’ 13 and earn the Panthers their sec-
' ,ond victory of the weekend. . '

The Pantherstied the game at one in the

» With two outs and Mildren still pitching
in the ninth inning, Pitt appeared to be set

- up to send the game into extrainnings.

But Mildren allowed a single and then hit
a batter. A double to left ﬁeld brought in the
winning run to put an end tothe Panthers’
extra-innings hopes. I

“We obviously did not swing it as well .

today as we did on Friday, but that is the

nature of this game,”_]ordano said. “George; _

town’s starter did a good job keeping us off
balance and they got a few timely hits. That
was the difference.”

Pitt faces Youngstown State tomorrow in
a nonconference matchup at the Petersen
Sports Complex. After that, the Panthers
will remain at home to take on Rutgers in
a three-game series stretching from Thurs-
day to Saturday. I l
