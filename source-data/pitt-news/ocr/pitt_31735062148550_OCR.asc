Dr. F riesell Will Speak at His Own
Banquet By Telephone

Testimonial

By Betty Schoeller

Dr. H. Edmund Friesell, dean of
the School of Dentistry, will lift a
telephone receiver in his Miami,
Florida, home this evening and
speak some 1,600 miles away to a
banquet-meeting of the Odotonlog-

ical society of Western Pennsyl-
vania in Hotel Schenley.

The dinner marking the centenary

of the dental profession will be a
testimonial to Dr. Friesell, who is
head of the dental department of St.
Francis and Children’s hospitals
and the Western Pennsylvania
Home for Children.

The novelty of attending one’s
own testimonial dinner by tele-
phone is occasioned by Dr. Friese1l’s
prolonged vacation in Florida. Ac-
cording to Dr. Harry Metz, head of

An outstanding ﬁgure in dental

of the dental profession in Pitts-

dental school in Philadelphia and
opened an office in East Liberty at
21. He joined the faculty of the
Pittsburgh Dental college in 1903,
becoming dean in 1904. He was in-
strurnenta,l in making the school a
part of the Western University of

Temorary Assembly

Authorized by Trustees

O1'.ga11izatio11 of a. temporary University Counci.l of

faculty-and deans was co.mpleted.late Friday at a meet-

ing in the office of l§l1()"(3haI1'(’,€llO].‘, with the announcement -
of ofﬁcersof the new group. _ _ _

Rufus I-I. Fitzgerald, provost of the University, was ~
elected chairman of the Council. Secretary 1S Dr. Sam- A

uel P. Franklin, professor of education and director of

courses in religious education. _ _ .
The new Council has a inembership of 68-ﬁve administrative .

officers, 14 deans, and 49 ranking professors of departinents through-

out the University.

Establishment of the University Council was authorized by the“

Board of Trustees on February 6, it was revealed Friday by M1’.

Fitzgerald. '

According to the Board’s statenient, tlienew group IS to servo ,
“as a University council or senate for a period of one year a.n(;l to

make recommendations to the Board concerning the desirabihty of _

establishing a permanent council.”

If practices at some universities are followed, the new Council will i

serve as an advisory body on educational and administrative policies and
procedures and to acquaint the faculty with University affairs. ‘

Root Heads Committee

A preliminary meeting of the new Council was held February 23, when»
a committee on nominations and an investigative committee were ap-

pointed. Chancellor John G. Bowman designated Mr. Fitzgerald to call: —

this meeting.

Nominations for officers of the group were reported by a committee‘;
headed by Dr. Stanton  Crawford, dean of the College. I
conducted by mail, and election results were announced at Friday’s’

meeting.

As chairman of a ‘committee to investigate the fu.nction;~‘
councils in other institutions and to consider topics for discussion, Dr. '~

‘*0

William T. Root, dean of the Graduate School, submitted a long report}.

_ Includeclin Dr. Root’s report on typical problems discussed by other
faculty councils were budget policies; faculty appointment, tenure, and
advancement; improvement of teaching personnel; improvement of scholar-
ship and research; public relations; student aid; athletic policiesl; student
problems; and registration procedures.

Faculty members recalled Friday that the University formerly had a
council of administrative oﬂicers, deans, and faculty representatives. This
council was in existence during the regime of the late Chancellor '.iVlcCor'-V
mick and the first ten years of Chancellor Bowman’s administration.

Revival of a faculty Council was recommended last year in the report i
of the special committee of the Board of Trustees which investigated the I

University’s administration.

Trustees Suggest Council

In the report of the trustee investigating committee, made public

last October, was the recommendation “that the Chancellor appoint a joint A

committee of administrative ofﬁcers and faculty members to formulate
and recommend to him, and through him to the Board of Trustees, plans»
for the establishment of a University Council as representatives of the
faculty, to be convened periodically and frequently by the Chancellor or;
his representative for the expression of the faculty’s advice on educational‘:

policies and procedures and to inform the faculty about the University’s --

current affairs.”

Another recommendation of the trustees investigating committee,.
“that the Chancellor convene the deans periodically and frequently as a»
cabinet for the expression of their advice on administrative policies and’
procedures and to inform them about the University’s current affairs,” is-‘

understood to have been in effect for some time. ‘
Although no official cabinet of deans exists, they have been meeting '
regularly with Mr. Fitzgerald to discuss administrative problems.

Administrative olﬁcers on the new University Council are Chancellor D

Bowman, Mr. Fitzgerald, Dr. John Weber, secretary of the University;
J. Gilbert Quick, registrar; and G. S. Rupp, assistant treasurer and bursar.

Deans who are members of the Council include Dr. Stanton C. Craw- ,

ford, the College; Dr. Charles S. Tippetts, Business Administration; Elmer

A. Holbrook, Engineering and Mines; Frank W. Shockley, acting dean of ’_

Education; Dr. ‘William T. Root, Graduate; Dr. William S. McEl1roy, Medi-
cine; Dr. H. Edmund Friesell, Dentistry; Alexander Marshall Thomspong.

Fraternities Play Host at Open
House Dance for All Students

Saturday is a red—1etter day in the
history of fraternity dances at the
University, for on that day the 13
men’s social fraternities on campus
will play host to all University stu-
dents.

The ﬁrst all-University open
house dance will ﬁnd the welcome
mat out at each fraternity house for
all thestudents at the University.

Previous interfraternity house
dances were limited to a group of
houses open for the evening, with
members of the others progressing
from one house: to another during
the dance. This dance will have all
houses open and all student couples
moving from house to house.

Purpose of these dances is to ac-
celerate the spirit existing between
fraternities and to build up a ‘Uni-
versity spirit among all the students.
Incidental to this-is the introduction
of non-fraternity"-students t3o=tll'e“so'-

cial life~of‘th'e'-fra‘terni,ty men . ». .

and it -isn-’t rush week!

Better
all is one of the primary aims of the
dance.

Heading the free interfraternity
event is Don Ceferatti, C40, Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, assisted by Richarde
R. Weiss, C40, Pi Lambda Phi, and
Seymour Farber, E42, Sigma Alpha
Mu.

No, We IDon’t
VVant Any Tickets

If the mythical social butterﬂy, Whose dance
budget was printed in last VVednesday’s News, had
ventured with his customary thoroughness into the
social ﬂurry of the last week-end, he would have
lought four dance tickets and would have added
Smother $10 to his previously-computed $163.18

lance bill.

V‘Ve’re inclined to doubt that any dance hound
did attend all four aﬁairs. At the same time we do
nbt doubt that four open dances are too many for
any one week-end. Being in the so-called small
dance category, they have to compete not only
with the “big” dances of the near past‘ and near
future, but also with each other. Unfortunately,
this competitioii with each other for publicity and
sales tends -to lead to forced--publicity stunts and to
petty jockeying for supposed advantages.

The result is unpleasantlfor all concerned; for
the dance chairmen, for their committees of ticket
sellers, and, most of all, for the student—cust’omers
who are button-holed with everything from typo-'1
graphic cigarettes to dangling skeletons and prom-
ises-‘of Hoevelerish gags. . _ ‘

— Without‘pret.ending t‘o»,have.arrived at a just
so1lut.ionito«-tl1e" dance problem, we believe ifsthe
smaller numerical groups 011 campus would be con-
tent with having closed dances, the social calendar
wouldbe cleared considerably, the unseemly rival.-
riesi would ‘cease.,« and the average student, who at
best, ca11 take in only one dance a 11ight’,_would be
spared several .‘-‘No’s”  week.

l"VVel' offer this sideliglit into the mg-11 cost of

1 social living at the University, not only as a possi-

blesolutiopn, but also as a polite refusal to our
friends among the next batch of dance committee

ticket-vendors.

' Attention, Cadet Colonel Harvey Cupp and Military

‘iMaybe I’m just a poor disillusioned sophomore or

Common Sense

Ziskincl Reviews Third
Term Issue Today  

By “Senator” Ziskind

Why the howling? Why the agonizing groans, the
Pleading, hysterical cries of Republican leaders "that
Roosevelt must not seek a third term? " Why the
admonition, the shaky-toned protest that such a ven-
ture would mean his certain defeat? Has the Repub-
lican leadership become the paternal father of the
Democratic Party? Is it so concerned about the fate
of. the opposition as to beg it not to “go wrong?”

No, my friends, the Republican Party sees in a. third
term the setting of a precedent “frought with danger
and extreme peril -to democratic institutions?’ And so

the Republican controlled state legislatures of New ,

York and New Jersey, by a clear-cut party vote, adopted
resolutions urging the national _.Congress to go on rec-
ord against a third term for Franklin D. Roosevelt. The
resolution was concocted in the Republican caucus be-
fore the respective houses‘ .met,gand With sweating
brows and exhausted expressionslfthe.«legislators has-
tened to vote approval. 1 P — i 7‘ - '

‘Kind of Paradox"

‘Meanwhile John Hamilton, chairman of the Re-
publican Party, and Hamilton Fish, the harrying min-
ute-man, challenged,Rooseveltto run so that the Re-
publican Party could trounce -Roosevelt and the New

» ‘Deal at one and the same tilme. After the heroic state-

ment was issued thel',j:gent1.emen“ ran for cover and sent
their lieutenants scurrying around in a desperate effort
to obtain‘ a Congressional ‘anti-third-term resolution.
You see, my ifrierld_s,‘it’s a kind of‘ paradox: The
Republican Party “v{_rants” _Roosevel~t to seek a third
term, and it’s strainingevery muscle to keep him from
doing it. ‘ <~ - ,1 1 ' A
Now I don’t want to be rude. But, if I may, I should
like to ask whythis curious carrying--on? Isn’t it true
that we still have elections in this country; that if
Roosevelt runs, even for a third term or a fourth or a
ﬁfth term, he has to get more votes than his opponent
to win? So why, fellow Republicans, this intense Worry
and passionate pleading! T ,
Ah! C I’ve got it! You’re afraid that Franklin
Roosevelt will get more votes than his opponent. You
see he’s popular. He’s done things. He’s a leader.
4 While, what do you have to offer?

A Rcsoumling Voice

You’ve got a Sir Galahad who sent a lot of criminals
in jail-Dewey. If kids under ten could vote he-‘might
win, but the more sober folk are not so enthusiastic
about a G-man for President. Our country has more
in it than criminals.

You’ve got a candidate who is running on the repu-
tation of his father—Taft. His father couldn’t get a
second term, and he seems colorless enough to merit
less. He speaks the gospel of normalcy.

You’ve ﬁnally got a Senator who believes that
everything should be done half way—Vandenberg. He
has a simple formula; If the Democrats want to pay
a sixty-dollar pension and the Republicans a thirty-
dollar pension, then settle it at forty-ﬁve dollars. That’s
not statesmanship. That’s mathematics.

So we must let the Republican leadership weep for
the “folly” of the Democratic Party in renominating
Roosevelt. We must let them warn of his “certain de-
feat,” of his “weaknesses” as a candidate, of his being
“embarrassed” by the voters. But whispering across the
prairie land and whistling through virgin forest and
crowded city I" hear a resounding voice growing with
increasing cadence and intensity. And it says: You
can’t beat something with nothing!

Survey
College Majority
Admit ‘Smoking’

By Student Opinion Surveys of America

AUSTIN, TEX., March 1l.—As a group, college stu-
dents are giving the tobacco growers a good business,
for well over half of them report that they are smokers.
Less than a third, however, smoke habitually, and half
of the women who attend the nation’s colleges and uni-
versities say they never indulge in cigarettes.

Sending out its scores of interviewers to talk to
students of all types, the Student Opinioncsurveys of
America, with the Pitt News cooperating, has compiled
statistics that show the tobacco habits of collegians.

“What is your favorite brand of cigarette?” a sci-
entiﬁc cross section of the colleges was asked. And
this is what they answered:

Lucky Strike . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..12.1%

Camel . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .10.4

Both men and women in greater percentages prefer ..

Luckies over any other brand (14.1 men, 8.8 women.)
But the girls placed Phillip Morris second with 7.6 per
cent, 7.1 per cent selecting Camels. The preferences of
men run in exactly the same order as those for all
students above.

Any caricature of the typical college woman as a
habitual smoker appears to be erroneous, for only 21.6
per cent declare that they smoke regularly. Men use
cigarettes, pipes, and cigars out of habit to quite a
larger extent than the co-eds, 34.3 per cent, or over a
third. The complete tabulations follow, statistically
representing the entire U. S. college and university en-
rollmentz

Interesting diﬁerences in cigarette preferences were
noticed in looking over the U. S. map_—perhaps due to
the influence of advertising in different sections. More
students in the West Central, Southern, and Far West-
ern ‘states say Luckies are their choice. But ' as one.

production. The technical
crew, under the Supervision of
James Lindsay, technical director,
and Walter Zischkau, BA41, tech-
nical manager, will adapt the de-
signs to the stage.

“The seven scenes have been de.

1 signed with an attempt to avoid log-
r ical forms,”

Mr. Elliott explains,
“This is to give the effect intended
in expressionistic drama.” —
_ Expressionism, according to Mr,
Elliott, aims at tangible portrayal of
emotional or mental-ideas. In this
Pultizer prize play, the author] has
treated his materials as freely as
possible, simplifying situations and
substituting types for individuals.
The settings, therefore," are dis-

.. torted and exaggerated, in line with

the psychological feeling, of
drama.

the
The play is concerned with

2 the psychosis of Mr. Zero, a non-

entity in a world of progress.
The ﬁrst scene is a bedroom,
tawdrily furnished, symbolic of
Zero’s vwhole world. Executed‘ in
cold and bright color, it will give an
effect of garish gas light. Nearly
everything in the scene is frankly

painted on the drops; there is no at-‘

tempt to create an illusion. .

A book-keeper’s office, typical of
Z,-ero’s life away from home makes
up the second scene. The furnish-
ings afe grossly exaggerated. No
attempt is made at reality, for desk
and stools tower six feet high over
a revolving stage.

mood of Zero’s hum drum exist-

Seismological
Head Predicts
Earthquakes

After eight weeks of compara-
tive quiet in the seismological ob-
servatory located in the sub-base-
ment of the Cathedral, Donald C.
Bradford, University seismologist
is prepared for ﬁreworks.

Reason?

“There are often many earth-
quakes following a quiet period,”
Bradford explained.

First “quake” to be recorded in
eight weeks was one last Monday
lasting an hour and determined by
Bradford to be about 2,790 miles
away. The disturbance Was either
on the coast of Ecuador or in the
Yakutat Bay, Alaska.

Next earthquake recorded on the
instrument occurred last Tuesday
which started at 7:13 p. m. and was
about 2,600 miles away. At 1:20 a.
m. Wednesday another disturbance
was recorded at about 2,000 miles
from Pittsburgh.

F rosh Athletes Claim

"Broken Promises’

Continued from page one

-men revealed a badlyjumbled and

confused system of ﬁnancial aid to
Pitt athletes. P

B The bogey of promissory notes,
prominent in last year’s freshman
football “strike,” made its appear-
ance again. Of 18 boys questioned,
17 had signed notes and of these, 10
claimed that they had been told by
either Kliskey, _business manager
John Weber, or track coach Carl
Olson to ‘forget the notes, that they
were “just a formality.”

7 A11 10 insisted that they had been
given the impression that their
buildings and grounds, jobs would-
cover only board, roorn,and books,
with tuition “taken care. of.”. Later
they wereasked to pay something
on the notes “to make it look good,”
and ﬁnally. they were told to pay
them in_ full... 0 . 3 . v_ -- .
$.48 PerMonth  - ' w , .

Another claim advanced by‘ ‘most
of the group was that Weber or
Kliskey had assured them that they
would work only two" or ~ three
hours a day and would receive $48
per month, the same arrangement
under which the juniors. operate.

Several of the boys saidthat they

d_.id_,not know. whatthe actual wage
rate was until, they received their
ﬁrst -check, =when it was revealed
that they were working‘ for $.50 an
hour, rather than approx-imately
$.90 as they had been led to believe.
 Outright aid in the form of schol-
arships’ varied. All of the group
questioned stated that they had been
told by Kliskey, Hagan or Weber
that their tuition would be paid
second semester if they maintained
a‘C average or better in their first
semester.
Scholarships Inconsistent
In a few cases this carried_ the
added promise of a bonus, the
amounts ranging from the remis-
sion of any tuition paid to a
straight $100 in cash. No one who
had been promised such a bonus re-
ceived it, the boys involved claimed.
Of those who achieved a C av-
erage ﬁrst semester, nearly all were
given some form of scholarship, but
there was no consistency in the
awarding. Some were given full
$150, some were given half tuition,
and in a few instances no award at
all was made.
Several freshmen held scholar-
ships their ﬁrst semester. These

Rah-Rahs Win
Over Theta Chi
Bowling Squad

Last year’s intramural champs
and this year’s engineering title-
holders were toppled in the opening
rounds of the all-campus. bowling
tournament last Wednesday on the
Center & Neville alleys.

Theta Chi’s ex-intramural win-
ners, with Roy Anderson and Bob
Vetter in their crew, were stopped
by the Rah-Rahs whose high-man,
Joe Aaron, took the afternoon’s top
honors with a 194 score. Arny
Levine, Joe Cubernick, and Mat
Meyer made up the rest of the Rah-
Rah roster.

Engineering’s Industrials, who
made the road a tough one for the
championship Amity’s in the intra-
mural race, were brushed oﬁ by
the Sweepers. With the Industrials
beaten, the Sweepers faced off with
the Pi Lams on Friday. Harry
Leonard, Bob Dalzell, Richard Trim-
bell, and George Lanz ﬁll the
Sweepers’ lineup.

Pi Lambda Phi’s niche in the un-
defeated side of the sheet was
carved out by a win over the
Lollerpops. The engineers’ second
team in the tourney, the Civils,
dropped their initial battle to the
Hi-Rocks during the Wednesday
session.

Neither the Pi Lams nor the
Sweepers showed up for their meet-
ing on Friday. However, the touted
Amity bowlers blanked the Chem-
ical Engineers, 3 to O.

The following matches are sched-
uled for the Strand alleys this aft-
ernoon at 4:30 o’clock:

Industrials vs. Lollerpops.

Theta Chis vs. Civils.

Sweepers vs. Pi Lams.

Rah-Rahs vs. Hi-Rocks.

Freshman Polar Loop
Closes Season Today

Final games of the Freshman Po-
lar league season take place today
as the league-leading Coldspots
meet the Defrosters and the Pen-
guins play the last place Seals.

The Coldspots must win their
game to retain sole ownership of
first place. If they lose they will

be’ tied for the championship with .

their competition., _ 1;.‘    -- 

were either half tuition or $100 per
semester, but in no case was the
recipient sure where the money
came from. “Three or four thought
they held senatorial scholarships,
others, thought they were given
building and grounds awards, and
still others didn’t care so long as
they weren’t asked to pay tuition.
No Work’ in Grid Season

One boy stated: “Weber just said
he’d, take_care of me. I don’t know
what kindof scholarship it is. As
long as lkeep a,C average, 1’m sup-
lJ0.Sed...t_o get the scholarship.” _

Also promised to them, several
footballplayers claimed, was that
they would not be required to -work
during football season and > that
their total practice period would be
only two hours. Instead, they stat-
ed, they spent two and ,a, -half to
three hours in practice,?then work-
ed four hours more _on their jobs.

Diamondstars
Cntinuet Drills

V A Pa’n,therNine  Open’.
'” Year with Long Trip V

While the majorleague baseball

tearhs_ are beginning their annual
drills in thewarm South, the Panth-
er nine is braving cold winter blasts
in Pitt’s heatless Stadium.

Last season’s baseball squad,
Pitt’s ﬁrst in a number of years, did
not attract a large number of ath-
letes. However, the game seems to
have caught on this winter and a
long list of rookies have reported to
bolster the contingent of veteran
sophomores and juniors.

This season Coach Mitterling will
bank on two capable hurlers, south-
paw Andy Johnson and righthander
Ed Haluska. Edgar Jones also may
be available for mound duty. Jim
Simpson, sophomore, lacks experi-
ence, but shows plenty of promise.

Of the catchers returning, varsity
backstop Hartman has the edge.
Goodell, Stahl, Digby, Ridabo, and
Gurcheim are the other candidates.

Inﬁelders Foliart and Holbrook,
and outfielders Keiper, Butch, and
Goelz will ﬁght to retain their reg-
ular positions of last year.

With almost all the 1939 varsity
and many bright prospects on hand,
Coach Mitterling promises a success-
ful season. The baseballers begin
their grind the ﬁrst week of April
when they invade enemy ﬁelds of
Wake Forest, Duke, Virginia, and
Maryland.

WAA Cagers
To Face Tech

After marking up two victories in
as many contests last Week, WAA
cagers are priming for their scram-
ble with Carnegie Tech lassies Wed-
nesday at 4:30 o’clock in the Cathe-
dral Gym as a Health Week feature.

The WAA team broke a ﬁve-year
jinx when they ﬁnally outscored the
YMHA girls, 14-11, at the Y gym
last Wednesday. Seniors Florence
Ragan and Annabelle Miller each
tallied half the WAA total.

In another snappy fray the fol-
lowing night, the Pitt sextet visited
the downtown gym of the Evange-
line Residence team and came back
with a 28-18 victory.

Ragan again showed the way by
tossing in 11 points. Senior Ann
Beatty also chalked up 11 markers
and Miller had six.

Passer-s Close
Year With Loss
To W. Virginia

Pitt's basketball team ﬁnished its
second losing season in three years
by falling before West Virginia,
42-35, Saturday night at Morgan-
town.

For the second consecutive week
high scoring Panther forward Ed-

die Straloski was completely tied ’

up, this time scoring just one ﬁeld
goal. Chepko’s 12 points led the
Mountaineers while l\/Iilanovich and
Scherer paced Pitt with 10 apiece.

From the moment Jim Ruch
opened the scoring with a ﬁeld
goal for West Virginia, Pitt was
behind. Baric and Mandich shov-
ed the lead to 9-7, and Kalmar and
Ruch made it 13-7. From then
until the half ended, Pitt scored
only twice, on two pointers by
Milanovich, while Chepko sparked
the Mountaineers in a scoring drive
that made it 22-11.

In the ﬁrst three minutes of the
second half, Chepko and Baric gave
West Virginia an 19 point lead as
the Panthers trailed, 31-12. Pitt
then spurted to narrow the gap to
38-24, as Baric was chased on
four personal fouls.

Baric’s departure was the sign
for the Carlsonmen to cut loose
with another rush of points and
bring the score to 40-33. Each
team scored one more before the
game ended.

Panther Cinder  Placest
Second in CIC Championships

East Lansing, Michigan, March 9.--A small band of Pitt‘ trackers
made a gallant bid for their Central Intercollegiate track title here
tonight, ending up in second place, four points behind the Marquette cin-

der team. '

The Golden Avalanche’s,all-around strength slightly overshadowed
the Panther’s individual brilliance, the A Marquette team tallying 351/2

points to Pitt’s 31.1’,/2. Notre Dame,
defending champ ﬁnished third with
231/2, and Michigan State, the host
team, took fourth with 211/2; .

Minus the services of..two. of its
most brilliant luminaries, Frank
Ohl and Al Boulanger and prob-
able point scorers Del Anderson
and Red Jessup, the Olsonmen put
up a remarkable battle.

When Hap Stickel and Bill Car-

ers, placed one-two in the 75-yard
dash, the Pitt squad grabbed an
early lead. Stickel dashed the 75

Wednesday Will Mark Entry Deadline

For University’s Spring Intramurals

Wednesday marks the entry dead-
line for the spring intramural pro-
gram which is scheduled to open
March 20. In the past week the ap-
plications have been pouring in
from groups in all three leagues.

All the berths‘ in the fraternity
mushball division have been filled
while tennis, golf and horseshoes
entries indicate that there will be
plenty of action on those three
fronts. Last year the Delts monop-
olized the brotherhood action when
they took the golf, tennis, and horse-
shoe laurels, neglecting only 1nush-
ball which fell to the Sammies.

When the time came for the SAM
boys to continue the strangle-hold
the fraternities had held on the in-
tramural mushball championship,
their opponents, the Gamma Gam-
ma Woos, broke the grip. That de-
feat put the crown into independent
hands for the first time.

This spring’s program will feature
a three-cornered ﬁght, with the fra-

defeat the defending Phi Kappas
Friday, 25-24, and force the intra-
mural basketball playoffs into an
extra game.

The Jerks held the upper hand
throughout the ﬁrst half and led
13-8 at the intermission. They
scored their points in the early part
of the game on ﬁeld goals by Mal-
lcy, Anania, Stetler, and Bonelli.
Halloran sparked the Phi Kappas
by tallying three of his team’s eight
points.

Phi Kaps’ Passing Poor

Both quintets sh-owed signs of
tension as their passing and shoot-
ing was far below par. The frater-
nity champs were especially guilty
of this practice.

Outstanding for the winners were

standbys Stetler ‘and .1)/Ialloy. The ”

pair frequently broke up passes and

shots made -‘by’ their opponents._ _A1lf-_.

intramural forward Jack Glenn
lived up to his reputation of out-
standing play for the Phi Kaps.

The independent champions held
a slight lead in the ﬁnal few min-
utes of play when the Phi Kaps,
with footballer Dick Cassiano lead-
ing the way, put on a scoring spree.
“Dandy” Dick caged two ﬁeld goals
in rapid succession. These, together
with the baskets by Halloran and
Glenn, put the fraternity team in
front. 1
Malloy Leads Attack

The Jerks came back, however,
with ﬁeld goals by Malloy and Stet-
Ier to take a one-point lead. Time
ran out on the Phi Kappas, who
tried everything in the book to tie
up the score. 

High scoring honors for the con-
test went to Bob Malloy of the
Jerks, who registered three ﬁeld
goals and two free throws for ‘an’
eight ' point ‘total. Phi -K'appa’Vs_r two,

‘ high . scorers,“ Tom iHalloran__  

 

Jack Glenn, were next with seven
apiece.

By winning Friday’s fray, the
Jerks’ ﬁve also earned the right to
meet the Phi Kappas again, this
time in the ﬁnal match of the double
elimination series.

According to the intramural of-
ﬁce, the deciding game will be play-

ed today at 4:30 o’clock on the Trees .

Fraternity Leaders

Await Later Action

On New IF Proposal
Students Expect Detail of Council’s

  P-oliti-cal Setup After Next Conclave

Fraternity men on campus were close-mouthed over the week-
end when approach.ed for their reaction to Int'erfraternit.y Council’s
proposal to endorse their own slates in the coming student elections.

In genera],-the -attitude of fraternity men was summed up in
th.e followiiigstatenient from ‘Richarde R. VVeiss, C40, former presi-

dent of Pi Lambda Phi: “ ‘

_‘‘Since none -of the plans for
fraternity menis policies in the
comingelections are deﬁnite yet,
I think it wiser for all of us to
wait until we know about what
we are talking.” . .

Introduced at a meeting of the
council last Tuesday evening by
Bill “Edrnunds, E40, Phi ‘Gamma
Delta, the plan to ‘endorse candi-
dates ‘was unanimously adopted by
the delegates present. James Ken-
nedy, C40, Delta Tau Delta, presi-
dent of the council, explained that
ratiﬁcation by individual fraterni-
ties is unnecessary, as the vote of
their representatives is considered
sufficient for adoption by the group.
Proposals Listed

While there was no deﬁnite an-
nouncement from either Kennedy or
Edmunds as to what the council
plans to do at election time, specu-
lation on campus -advanced the fol-
lowing as likely courses of action:

1. “Only fraternity men will be
endorsed for positions in the Stu-
dent-Faculty Association, Men’s
Council, and the College Associa-
tion. '

2. Fraternity men and fraternity
women will be endorsed by the
council.

3. Fraternity men and students
in the School of Dentistry, the so-
called “dental bloc,” will be se-
lected.

4. Fraternity men and women
and dental students will be en-
dorsed.

5. The council will endorse fra-
ternity men, fraternity women,
dental students. and independents.
Meeting Scheduled

A special meeting of the council
to consider the workings of the as
yet indeﬁnite endorsement system
will be held at the Phi Epsilon Pi
fraternity house on Wednesday
evening, Kennedy announced.

It is expected that the details of
the council—end.orsed slating plan
will be announced at that time.
Most fraternity leaders are waiting
until that meeting before comment-
ing on the proposal.

One fraternity man stated: “It
is a good plan and I think it will

work, but I’d like "to hear more
about it before I can say much
about it.”

The ‘I-F proposal follows within a
month after Fraternity Presidents’
Council, wome'n’s ‘fraternity group,
announced its “Hatch Act” to re-
move fraternity ‘women from the
campus political scene.

FPC Plan Opposed

Opposed ‘by four large fraterni-
tiesat the time of its inception, the
women’s plan was subsequently
called an attempt to “clean up the
political situation.”

The ‘Interfraternity Council plan
is in direct opposition to the FPC
proposal, in that it puts the frater-
nities and their organization ‘openly
in the political limelight with en-
dorsed candidates, rather than hav-
ing them withdraw from politics.

The action taken by the council
is unprecedented in University his-
tory. It was explained by Kennedy
and -Edmunds that the proposal was
made as a part of the series of plans
which fraternities are suggesting to
“improve the status of I-F Council
in the eyes of the students.”
