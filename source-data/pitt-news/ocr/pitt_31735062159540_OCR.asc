New T-Squad No Closed Corporation

Says Casanova; Candidate

.,T EFLNI, EE 'f(llIS WAY,-- Len Casanova, new football mentor, tells
ac e ic Bo ovac and Back Joe 0 Bara the way things willpbe next

year under the "T” formation.

Gas Furnace A ugments

Cu rtailed Heat Supply

Conversion has already been made here to meet the conditions
of a power and heat shortage arising from the coal strike, accord-
ing to Dr. John Weber, secretary of the University. v

The University’s auxiliary gas furnace was turned on Wednes-
day at 8 a.m. in an effort to sustain the coal supply of the Belle-
field Boiler Plant, which usually supplies the University’s heat,

for as long as possible.

Though the auxiliary equipment,
located beneath the Cathedral, is
unable to supply the entire heat re-
quirement, a comfortable tempera-
ture can be maintained if the camp-
us buildings are givenapre-heating
says Dr. Weber.

This pre-heatingperiod consisted
last Wednesday of two morning
hours during which heat from the
Bellefield plant was supplied at a
full rate. Then, by using the Univ-
ersity’s gas furnace, heat from the
plant could be cut off.

The auxiliary heating equipment,
supplemented by blowers and local
heating in some buildings, can sup-
ply heat for the entire campus.This
equipment is tested at regular int-
ervals so that its efficiency during
conditions such as those that pre-
vail at present can be assured.

The University is also Obey-
ing the Duquesne Light Company's
request of the beginning of the
week to cut down 50 per Cent 01'!
electricity.

Two elevator’s are being put out
of use between rush periods. Ray-
mond L. Coss, superintendent of
the buildings and grounds depart-
ment, has asked for the shutting
off of all nonessential electric
equipment and lights. \

Len Casanova, Pitt’s new foot-
ball coach, stepped to the rostrum
of Stephen Foster auditorium last
Wednesday and told about 300 wel-
coming students that “the 1950
football team will not be a closed
corporation.”

_The ex-Santa Clara mentor appar-
ently meant to assure the Univer-
sity’s single wing gridders that
they need not worry because of the
T-formation innovation.

"Anyone _who wants to play the
game will be welcomed to the
squad,” Casanova declared. '

Student Support Asked

Procla iming himself uneasy before
an audience, the bronzed, gray-
haired coach displayed no diffi-
culty as he addressed the enthu-
siastic audience. speakingjn a
firm, clear tone, he enjoined Pit-
tites to support their team.

“Nothing can be accomplished
without it,” he said.

Casanova went» on to say that he
hoped the future will bring a return
to the golden footballera that once

i was Pitt’s.

"I am aware of the wonderful
tradition here,” he said.

Commenting further on the ath-
letic stiuation, Casanova expressed
a l/ilcinlg for thetype of player who
takes part in other phases of Uni-
versity life.

"lam surelwill be happy at Pitt,
and I want to make the student’s
life more enjoyable,” he concluded.

Others Voice Welcome

The Student Congress sponsored
program,which included cheers and
songs, was Casanova’s ‘formal in-
troduction to the student body.

Other speakers were, Captain
Tom Hamilton, who lamented the
lack of interest in wrestling; Don
Wilde, the official student repre-
sentative; and Dario Icardi-, student
emcee.

Encourages Hard Fight _

Bewailing the fact that non-grid-
ders are missinga great experience,
Casanova asserted that “football
gives men a better understandingof
everyday problems.”

Move Ahead

Plans for the proposed$$l,500,000
Pitt student center are moving “full
steam ahead” and rumors that the
University is contemplating scrap-
ing the whole project have been
branded false by Dr. John Weber,
secretary of the University.

During the past week talk has
been circulating through the school
that due to pinched financial con-
ditions resulting from an unful-
filled fund drive plans for the
new student center would be ab-
andoned.

Dr. Weber, however, asserted
emphatically that such a reversal
of tactics has not entered the .dis-
cussions of University planners.

The Building Fund Campaign
Drive has slowed down at approxi-
mately $7,800,000 of a $12,700,000
drive for needed construction funds.

Campaign officials set January,
1950, as the tentative closing date
for the drive when it began in
June, a 1948. When the deadline
arrived, however, nearly $5 million
was lacking. Since that time little
progress has been made.

According to Dr. Weber, the main
hindrance in the path of the center
now is the ‘drawing board where
architects have not been able to
turnout finished plans and blue-
’ keep up with ‘

   
 

othae

under one roof.

Nelson brought back a general
picture of student unions and a
concrete picture of the University
of Pennsylvania center. The Penn
center is under the direction of a
board of governors, eight seniors
who have come up from among the
"heelers” or assistant governors.
Freshman or sophomore heelers are
screened from year to year until
finally the eight most capable are
chosen as governors.

The editor of the college paper
is always a member of the board of
governors. ,

Activities carried on in the Penn
student union include bridge les-
S005» dancing, Varietv shows, de-
bates, assemblies, movies, and
coffee hours.

In spite of the opportunity for a
wide variety of activities at some
other schools, Nelson reports, Pitt
appeared to have the most satis-
factory and most efficientfreshman
orientation program. No other col-
lege represented offers a program
approaching the two-month series
of orientation classes used here.

~ Letters to theliditorg

The letter that Managing Editor
Dick Kovar submitted at the time of
his resignation from Student Con-
gress carries a message that ex-
presses an interesting attitude to-
ward the time, importance, and
position activities can play in a
stude nt’s school life. Consequently,
we reprint it, in abbreviated form,
here.

Miss Flora Diemert,
President, Student Congress

In tendering this resignation, let
me make something of a ‘farewell
address’ concerning Congress it-
self. My own situation makes me
acutely aware of the conflicts that
can arise when a student tries to
devote himself to rob many posi-
tions.

In my own case, it has meant
that neither the News nor Congress

lﬂum-Schewe

I Sloppy Precedent

  

Student Center and a temporary men's lounge on the Cathedral’s

eighth floor to precede the erection of the permanent Student

Center structure on the campus. Coming even before these interim

facilities, we now have lounging facilities outside the band and
_ music appreciation room on the eighth floor.

And, if that's to be taken as an example of the way these fu-
ture recreational halls are going to be received, the University
and students might as well put a match to their blueprints and for-

‘get the whole thing.

 g. 3 Not that students aren’t taking advantage of the dozen tables
' parked there. No, you almost need a reservation to get one during
most of the day.Card games and the like go there from early morn-
ing until well into the evening. As far as that is concerned, the
popularity of these added “spare-time” facilities can certainly’
be seen. ‘
I But the way this hallway lounge is being treated at times,
one would think it was being used as an adjunct to some over-
crowded kindergarten. Even many five-year-olds have already
learned to be more neat and careful.

A view/of the area before the cleaners tackle it at night leaves
one with the impression that all the rubble in the Cathedral has
been collected and dumped there. Cigarette butts litter the floor

« despite the presence of a half-dozen giant metal ashtrays near
the tables.

Paper -- candy wrappers, lunch bags, score sheets with "We-
They’s” heading long columns of figures -- are strewn liberally
over the floor and on the tables wdhich aren't occupied with a
mass of clothes and books.

What makes this messy sight worse is that it is located in the
hall of one of the busiest floors in the building, where many
visitors from the outside come. They certainly must be highly
impressed if they turn toward Bigelow instead of Bellfield when
they alight from an elevator. This lounge doesn't have doors to
hide its disheveled state.

Will carelessness, like the brands of cigarette burns that
virtually outline every one of the practically-new tables there, be
multiplied in the larger eighth-floor lounge, in the Grace Reform
quarters, if and when they are used, and in the permanent Center?

 
 

 

 

  

If those who are working on these projects notice the present
lounging area, small wonder if they begin to doubt the advisability
of going any further with their plans.

 

A lot of talking and planning is being done about a temporary-

By JOAN SCHEWE

Pertinent to Pitt students is the
question, “What do you think
of the switch from the single wing
to the T formation?” A few men
admitted ignorance of the subject.
The ladies, bless them, for the
most part, ‘remained silent. Those
who were stimulated.gave the ans-
wers appearing below.

Elmer Hollstein, College '52:
"It should bring out a lot more
players.”

Nancy O'Connor, College '51:

"We’ve had the tea in the Commons
Room every day at 3:30.”

Mike Soffa, Ed. '50: "Great. We
can have more razzle-dazzle. The
plays themselves are more interest-
ing and more deceptive. There are
a variety of attacks and aerial em-
phasis.”

Peggy Ferguson, Ed. ‘$0: “No
difference to me.”

Bob Fesko, College '52: "The
single wing was based all on power.
The T gives much more deception.
Blocking assignments on the line
won’t be as tough.”

Richard Coppula, College '50:

“Pitt has a light backfield. It
should use the T.”
.Al'thlll' G. Nicola, Engr. '50:

"With the material Pitt has now,the
single wing ‘is better. It will take
a couple of years before Pitt will
have anything in football.”
Charles Liebert, College ’51:
“It should lead to higher scores,
and higher scores increase the
chance of winning games. The

 

single wing is becoming obsolete,
unless you have the best of mater-
ial.”

Robert Boyer, Engr. ’51: "It’s
the best thing that could happen to
Pitt. It will attract more hot shot
high school players.”

Mike Uric, special student: "In
the T there isn't as much body con-
tact and therefore it isn’t as hard
on the players.”

Bill -llardesty, Ed. '50:‘ "The T
is the most successful formation
used today.” _

Larry Brent, College '50: "It
will provide a more exciting type
of action. It ought to fill the stad-
ium every Saturday.”

Marilyn Herr, College “50: "If
you have good football material,
you can teach the players anything.”

Sue Delphey, College '53: “It

will take time to adjust, but from
the standpoint of the team it will
be better. A little less chance of

injury and more flashy plays.”

Bill Sichk0,College '52: "It will
be more to the spectator’s liking.”

Fred Botti, Ed. '51: "I think it
is superior because it is a better
passing formation. Its quick open-
ers and cross bucks can beat any-
thing a single wing has to offer.”

Ronald Kish, College '53: "It is
for the better. Most teams are us-
ing the T now.”

Mabel Allen, Ed. ‘$1: “I think it
 an advantage.‘ Several fellows I

has received the full attention
which I owed to each,to say nothing
of the superficial attention my
studies and non-school activities
have received.

This same conflict can be ob-
served, I am sure, in students who
are also holding too many irons
in the fire and trying to keep them
all hot. From this observation, I
strongly recommend that Congress
enact legislation to control this
situation, as was tried, unsuccess-
fully, at earlier meetings under my
own leadership.

I am sorry that I shall not be able
to carry on my Congressional duties:
I am even sorrier that, for various
reasons, I have not been able to
do all that I wanted while I was
on Congress. Maybe my successor
can do better.

No one realizes more than I do
the implications attendant upon
my resignation. I believe that a
student who cannot carry out all
his duties or who is not certain
that he will remain in office should
turn down that office at the very
beginning. Unfortunately, Ithought
when I accepted my election" to
Congress that I would be capable
of handling both jobs.

Therefore, I cannot accent too
strongly the need for competent
leaders to be chosen for student
government offices and the neces-
sity that persons running for office
consider fully the requirements

election.

The number of resignations and
subsequent internal elections occur-
ring in Pitt student government this
year made a farce of the whole set-
up. Let's hope that I will be the
last person who, through lack of
foresight, has to make himself
part of any such ridiculous proced-
ure.

Advice

Editor,
Pitt News

Mr. Kovar, your Managing Editor,
hit a new low in journalistic achieve-
ment with his column in the Febru-
ary 28 issue.

It is entirely possible that the
article was phrased so astutely that
I missed the point he was attempting

Richard D. Kovar

for office before even running in an ,

to make. Proceeding on the assump-
tion that there was no point, I should
like to offer some comments on the
column. '
The editor ofany publication has
the final say on what does, and what
does not appear in his publication.
If I may be permitted, I should like
to make some suggestions as to a
more fruitful use of the space de-
voted to Kovar’s clumsy method of
informing Pittites ‘ of his consis-
tently high quiz marks in "poli. sci.”
1) The editor might choose to
publish the grades of the members
of"the News staff, and break them

_down under two classifications-
Vet vs. Non-Vet.

2) He might choose to publish
some of the better themes turned in
for Freshman Composition. Thus,
other obviously young and inspired
authors could see their work in
pdnu

3) He might choose to revise a
long standing policy and print ad-
vertising in that space, thus getting
some return from a number of inches
that must be filled with something.

think Mr. Kovar would like to hear I

“We all know that an independent
organization is going to spring up
this Spring just before elections”
and just because of elections, he
inferred.

Recognizes Politics

The group is with us now. But
there are indications that it is not
as Fox foresaw it.

"We’re trying to integrate the
non-fraternity student into Pitt’s
social and cultural life,” states
the Executive Council of the revi-
talized Pitt Independent Associa-
tion.

The Council does not completely
ignore the political side of campus
life. "It would be foolish to create
an artificial vacuum in politics
when we’re trying to fill the vacuums
in_other fields,” it honestly admits.

The organization’s leaders also
admit that if an independent leader
shows himself capable, he will
probably receive the backing of the
PIA.

Faces Problems

It is this honesty which has led
many who have heard about the
group to see in it the possible birth
ofpan independent faction for the
independents and not against the
fraternities. It’s going to take quite
a lot ofwork before the entire school
body goes along with this belief.

In past years too many indepen-
dents have used the PIA as a step-
ping stone to advance their own
ambitions. Usually the individual
just almost makes an office while
the organization itself never gets
near the boat. I ’

It was mentioned at Student Congress’ initial meeting of this

Ray Maher and Don Ewart had just proposed that Student Con-
gress foster an independent organization. The discussion was
growing heated with insult topping insult when Dave Fox said it.

 
 

As evidenced by the above state-
ments of policy, it has not avoided
the fact that there are politics to
be dealt with.

To have ignored this situation
would have been hypocritical.

Norhas it made politics its chief
issue, neither ostensibly nor actu-

“attempting to plan social func-

to quote PIA President George W.
Kimmel in his letter to the News.

Its great problem, other than sur-
mounting the bad connotation that
independent groups have on campus,
ishowto deal with the large number
of non-affiliated students.

Of course that problem won’t exist
until a large number of students
show an interest in joining the or-
ganizaticn. The Executive Council
has been making plans and believes
itself capable of handling the stu-
dents’ interests.

In this task they probably will
not be alone. Student Congress in
a straw vote at the time of Ewart-

ness to aid an independent group.

Student Congress slipped back

into its "resigning rut” Monday
with the resignation of Richard
Kovar.

Kovar, who was internally elec-
ted last Fall, resigned because of
increased duties as managing editor
6f the News.

In a letter to Flora Diemert, Con-
gress president, Kovar stated that
the “number of resignations. . .made
a farce of the whole election set-
up.” He also suggested that Con-
gress “enact legislation to control
this situation (the large number of
resignationsl.”

This resignation is Congress’
second loss in two weeks. At the
previous meeting Miss Diemert an-
nounced that Dave Cleland was no
longer in school.

Clinton H. Lowery edged out Roy
Titchworth in Monday’s election to
fill the remaining two months of
Cleland’s term. Loweryis a member

More Credits Needed

The student must earn at least
44 credits in his major subject
and related courses. Of these, at
least 12 must be in related courses,
and eight in a conference course.

The total number of credits for

s Groups, speaking on "How "It
Feels Is to Be a Member of a Min-

Speakers representative of the
Jewish, Catholic and Negro stu-

speech. The talks are concerned
primarily with personal experiences.

No Soap Box Oratory

"We try to stay off the soapbox,”
said Howard Greenberger, one of
the speakers.

After the speeches the meeting
is turned into a question and ans-
wer period. Questions usually con-
cern characteristics of the particu-
lar group.

Opinions on nationality or dia-
lect jokes and intermarriage are
usually sought from the speakers.
The decline of discrimination in
the South in particular is usually
brought up for discussion, accord-
ing to Greenberger.

People Interested

"People do showa great deal of
interest in the question period,”
Greenberger added.

When queried as to whether these
question-discussion programs have
any effect on discrimination, he
replied, “we hope so.”

"At least the people become
aware of the problem. We try to
talk about the discrimination which
most people practice without real-
izing it. Our talks are concerned
with the insidious prejudice, like
the ‘you’re a nice guy, but you’re
different’ attitude,” said Green-
berger.

that he can give the exact number

Another favorite diversion of
Jack's is watching the sports events

The purple and ermine for the
coronation of this year’s Senior
Queen will be taken out for fitting
when the nominees are presented at
the annual Rose Tea, next Tuesday
at 4:30 p.m. in 1217 Cl.

senior women to place nominee sug-

Speaking ofthe Bureau, Reynolds
said, “They have done a wonderful
job in uncovering the weak points
of retailing.” The next move, he
commented, will be "to apply what

it in retailing.” '

Asked about the ball point pen,
Reynolds replied, "They were just
a passing phase in my life.” The
stocky, tanned world traveler dis-
covered the ball points in Buenos
Aires in 1945. Even then they were
not new, having been invented in
1888 by an American, John Loud.

Within a short time the ballpoint
by Reynolds was an institution in
the United States.

During the {two years in which
Reynolds pushed sales for his com-
pany he hit the cointry with some
of the biggest promotion stunts in
recent years, including a record-
breaking flight around the world and
a lesser— known search for the
highest mountain in interior China.

In April 1947, he cruised his
airplane, the Reynolds "Bomb-
shell,” around the world fast enough
to give Howard Hughes’ old record
for the same feat a bad beating.

Reynolds poured $175,000 into
this flight. After it was over he
posed for the cameras with a smil-
ing President Truman and chortled
about '”a million dollars worth of
free publicity.”

All this Reynolds accomplished
with one year of high school. "In

The buildings and grounds de-

result of defects in the bottom of

made the University must decide
whether the length of time Trees

Veteran’s Administration to deter-

The VA now owns the building,and
under the terms ofa previous agree-
ment, the University was to move
out late this spring.

According to Frank Carver of the
athletic department, there is a
chance that the University may use
the gym for several additional mon-
ths. If and when this is determined
and an estimate is made of the cost
of pool repairs, a decision on the
tank will be forthcoming. It is hop-

. . . . t
ed that this decision will be made
in the near future, says Mr. Carver.

After two dry inonths, the pool was refilled at the beginning
of this semester. However, it was soon found that the water was
draining at an abnormal rate, rendering the pool unusable.

Wisemen in

1st Round

Twice in the past two years the Go-
phers have come close but not close
enotgh to the intramural crown. This
year may be different. They moved
through the first round of playoffs Tues-
day by trouncing the YMCA, 61-48..
_ The ace ofthe champs was Bill Ford,

who tallied 20 points against the Wise-
men.

Fast breaking in the initial quarter,
the Gophers led by a 16-7 margin and
extendedtheir lead to ten points, 28-18,
by halftime.

At this point Ford and George Koury
began hitting from the middle to main-
tain the lead until the final whistle.

Teenie liarrls of the Y tallied 25
points to be high man for the evening.

Eps Champs

A mass of over 200 cheering
spectators jammed themselves into
Tree’s gym Monday night and watch-
ed the Phi lips win the ‘fraternity’
championship for the third year in
a row by defeating the Theta Chi’s
45-42.

A feature attraction of this champ-
ionship game was an ensemble of
of the Theta Chi marching band
trying to inspire their team to
victory, but to no avail.

A powerful surge was made by
the Theta Chi’s in the third quarter
as they started to roll over the Eps,
but the Champions held on and were
trailing, 34-35, when the stanza
ended.

The Phi Ep’s, however, proved
too powerful in the fourth quarter
and pushed out in front.

Pitt ’s Largest

A 24-game baseball schedule
was announced by the Athletic De-
partment today. This is the largest
baseball card in Pitt's history.

.,A four garrie southern trip over
the Easter recess, during which
VMI and Maryland will be played,
is a feature of the slate. Both Mary-
land and VMI were banned from
competing with NCAA member
schools earlier in the year by the
National Collegiate Athletic As-
sociation because of alleged Sanity
Code violations.

Meanwhile practice for Coach
Ralph Mitterling’s team continues

’ at the Stadium bullpen.

Mitterling, who expects to field
as strong a team this year as last,
has three good men ready to fill the

a speech. Obviously fighting strong
emotion, Warner nevertheless made
a valiant attempt to express his
pride and happiness over the meet.
He was unable to do much more

stood up and described at length
the difficulties Professor Warner
had overcome in order to make the
meet possible. He went on to thank

a biting wind.

Cas shuddered a second time for

much point in telling the man that
Pittsburgh winters have been pretty
mild the last couple of years. He
arrived here the second day of a

up, so he probably would not find
much consolation in "mild winter”

And he’d be right. We do have
C rotten winters, mild or no. V,

But there is more here than just

strictly conservative -- just in be-

Up in the line we don’t insist on
big fellows. Why, at Santa Clara

Thus, it seems apparent that

I News Errs

,3,-In IF Yarn

With due respect-to the frat men,
as the Pitt News stands corrected.
V In last Tuesday’s edition the
News reported erroneously that
previous IF champions went di-
rectly into the final all-campus
championship game.
a With a sharp reminder from last
‘ year's IF champ, the Phi Eps, and
a check on last year’s News it was
found that the Greeks had to play
one playoff game in 1949 before
they could qualify for the finals.
Therefore, they could have been
_ eliminated in the first game, but
.still could finish among the top
,four. .
However, The News was correct
3 in stating that the road would be
-rougher for the Greeks this year
 than in the past. This season they
T will have to play more than one
i if game to get to the final, as they
. must start at the bottom of a 16-
“ - team playoff.

Pitt Trackmen Open Indoor
Season Against Munt Union

ludoor track makes its initial home appearance on the Panther sports
scene tomorrow when Pitt plays host to Mt. Union College at Schoon-

maker Hall, South Park. Starting ti

me is scheduled forl p.m.

Former cross country members
will be the Panthers’ entries in
the 1000-yard run, mile, and two
mile events, John Kountz, John
Wilson, and Jack "Red” Weigel
are entered in the 1000-yard run;
Frank Kuzma, Jay Neilson, and
Ed Carnegie are listed for the
mile while Ed Berman, Jack Mc-

the two-mile.

Hurdlers Richard Lindley, Bob
McKowen and Richard Hohan will
compete in the_ 50-yard high and
low hurdles. Ralph Stillwagon,
William Sarver, and Norman Kur-
cher are set for the'S0-yard dash,
while Richard Drum will team with
the above three in the sprint relay.

The shot put, broad jump, and
high jump will constitute the re-
mainder of the meet's events. Only
Javelin and discus will be missing

Following this meet, the Pan-
thers have a date for the Knights
of Columbus games at Cleveland,
March 17.

BEST SCORING AVERAGE on

belong to a varsity performer but to
a freshman point specialist. Mickey
Zernich, the Aliquippa ace, has
plunked in 175 points in 11 games
for a 16 point per game average.

Mat Season

Ends at W. Va.

Coach Rex Peery’s wrestlers’
pack their grips and holds and go to
Morgantown this Saturday for s a
match with West Virginia, the final
dual meet of the season.

The Panthers, winless in nine

meets, will probably receive a rude
reception from the ridge dwellers.

Panthers expected to give the
Mountaineers the most trouble to-
morrow are Captain Doc Conklin,

Ray Cappelli, and lanky Frank
Skirpan.
Skirpan, Pitt 145 pounder, will

meet Captain Bob DeAntonis. In a
pre-season match at Uniontown
earlier in the year, Skirpan decis-
ioned the Mountaineer.

Conklin is Pitt's best grapple:
with a record of seven victories,
one draw, and one loss. Don Knif-
fen will be Conklin’s opponent,
while Cappelli will tangle with
Jimmy Miller, Mountie 128 pounder.

With the exception of Ed Stewart,
Peery will start the same team to-
morrow that started against Waynes-
burg last week.Stewart, a 155 pound-

Shratter, who suffered a shoulder
injury in the Waynesburg meet.

On the fraternity front, the Phi
Ep PEPs copped the IF title

By DON MURDOCK

"Let George do it” is not just
an empty phrase to George"Scotty"
Phillips, a member of the Pitt fresh-
man basketball team. For George has
been called on several times to
accomplish the difficult.

The 6-0, 175-pound athlete is a
product of Robinson Twp., a small
school with slightly less than 200
students. Although only six foot,
George was the tallest member of
the Robinson High School team. He
was a regular center for three years
for Coach Bob Wrenshall, and was
team high scorer in his junior and
senior years.

High School Beat Odds

In 1948 George got his first taste
of the "difficult” when the small
school copped the Section 16 flag.
Going into the sectional playoffs
the Robinson Ramblers were given
no chance whatsoever.

Nevertheless, led by‘ Phillips’
high scoring they whipped three
playoff opponents and lost only to
the Irwin Black Knights in the
finals. It was no disgrace for the
small school, becuase Irwin event-
ually won the state title.

Coming to Pitt,Scotty once again
found a difficult situation. Unlike
his high school experience, George
discovered that he was one of the
shortestplayers in freshman prac-
tice. However he rose up to meet’
the problem and now he has the
distinction of being the shortest
man on the starting five.

New Style

Also working against the 18-year
old. lad was the different style of
defense and offense that Coach
“Bobby Artman called upon him to
master, but Scotty answered the call
and learned in quick fashion.

"On offense,” he explains, "I
was used in high school as a re-
bound man and I scored most of
my points from the pivot. Here at
Pitt I am called upon more for set
shots from the outside or drive-in.
layups.” ”

Phillips has been affected more
than many of his teammates by the
change from high school to college
ball, but he’s overcome obstacles
before.

SC Has Nothing on EC,

Boystown Solons Moan

By LEO MOSS . .
Student Congress isn’t the only governing organization with

troubles. Its little brother, the Ellsworth Center Student Council,
has its share. And their problems are basically the same.
According to President Andrew Daly,Col. ’52, "unfortunately,

like; Student Congress, _we don’

could”_ because of quibb_ling over
"technicalities in parliamentary

procedure.”

The result of this is the jam-
ming of some of Council’s basic
campaigns. Since the freshman and
junior varsity football teams took
-over most of the ground floor,
Ellsworth’s biggest headache is
its lack of space for any recreation
whatever. But Frederick E. Lange,
advisor to Ellsworth Council, says
that Council has placed “not much
pressure”in the direction of recrea-
tional facilities.

In line with this problem how-
ever, E. C. Council is campaign-
ing for longer open hours in the
Tuck Shop. (It now closes at 2:30
p.m.) If this goes through there
could be card playing, ping pong,-
and other game room activities in
the afternoon.

One of the sore spots that Pres-
ident Daly hopes to correct is the
election system. In the past, posi-

petitions were received. Also a
nominating committee passed on all
petitions. Favoritism has often en-
tered in so plans have been propo-
sed to make the systempmore suit-
able.

Aside from legislative duties,
the other side of E. C. Council’s
activity slate includesthe Center’s
sociaL functions.

At theﬁbeginning of the fall sem-
ester, there was a new system of
activities cards begin that gave
Ellsworth students a reduction in
prices to all their social affairs.
These affairs included a picnic in
the fall, a Christmas party, a Chris-
tmas dance, and the Freshman
Chinatown dance. Because of the

success of thisvventure, the Coun-
cil has a surplus in its treasury.

Council financially supports the
E. C. glee club and sponsors dis-
cussion groups, movies, and free
co-ed luncheons for Ellsworth stu-
dents.

Each year 14 keys are awarded
to students who have furthered the

Pitt Students a Sorry Lot,

Criminal Survey

Reveals

By ANN GUSSIN V
Delinquency in the pasts of Pitt students is closely correlated
with that of Juvenile Court wards, according to a survey conduct-
ed by Miss Veronica Maz, graduate assistant in the sociology

department.

Two hundred and seventy two Pitt students, 167 men and 105

women, took part in the study to
determine the amount and kind of
juvenile offenses committed by col-
legestudents. They answered ques-
tionnares in complete privacy, and
deposited their ‘answers in an U11‘
marked box, so that there would be
no feeling of uneasiness, Miss Maz
explained.

The results showed that two-
thirds of the women and nine-tenths
of all the men had committed offen-
ses. Only two had been referred to
court.

Of the total of 655 offenses com-
mitted, traffic violations, malicious
mischief, and petty stealingranked
highest. Sex offenses ranked fourth
for boys and third for girls among
the students participating in the
survey.

The study showed that the high-
est number ofoffenses amongmales
had been committed by students of
law andpsychology. Miss Maz feels
this may indicate that the relatively
high rate of childhood disorganiza-
tion may have influenced the stu-
dents in choosing their careers.

Another sighificant fact shown
by the surveyis that offenses dis-
closing emotional disturbances

and family difficulties, such as
truancy, ungovernability and run-
ning away, were surprisingly low
among Pitt students.

The high number of traffic viola-

tions as compared with those of
Juvenile Court wards indicates a
greater amount ofeconom-ic security
among college students, says Miss
Maz.

She could find no significant
correlation between the number of
offenses committed, and family in-
come and nativity.

the job, asked Pettler what form
she should use in composing the
letter. He told her to use “exact-
ly the same form as she had used
for the Westinghouse letter.”

Jay M. Sharp, writing for the
Aluminum Company; regretted that
it was against company policy
to give ads to magazines such
as the one Pettler described. He
did say:

* “The angle you suggest is very
interesting. It has never occurred
to us to attemptto publicize the
WESTINGHOUSE name in our
advertisingitbut the idea is very
intriguing. As a matter of fact,
if ”you could be successful in
getting Westinghouse to do the
same for us, we might be even

the School of Education.

willing to break down our policy.”
