Candidates for SGB president debate student issues

Marc Friedberg came out fighting,
while Justin DalMolin remained soft- spo-
ken and subdued. Despite their differing
modes of presentation’, both candidates
for Student Government Board President
discussed their plans for “putting students
first” to an audience comprised of a mere
50 people at last night’s debate.

Bob Hopkins, Pitt’s housing director,
was one of two administrators in atten-
dance and did not seem surprised at the
newest example of student apathy. He
said he thought the event a “marvelous
exercise in democracy” despite the fact
that attendance was low.

“There are 50 students here, while
more than 13,000 will be represented by
the president,” said Hopkins.

Students who did attend voiced con-

cems ranging from the disenfranchise-
ment of student groups, such as CWO
and the Asian Students Association, to the
allocations process for freshmen.

CWO representative Laura Bardwell
expressed her skepticism for Marc
Friedberg"s plan to eliminate SGB pro-
gramming in favor of delegating this
responsibility to departments within the
University. She said she feared that pro-
grams such as the upcoming seminar on

‘the “date-rape drug” Rohypnol would not

be possible without supportirom SGB.

Friedberg held fast to his assertion
that freeing SGB members from the all-
consuming task of organizing programs
would allow more time to concentrate on
interacting with student groups.

“If we get rid of SGB-sponsored pro-
gramming, student organizations will get
more money,” said Friedberg.

Pitt students and administrators
talked about talking last night at a
“town-hall meeting” held in Benedum
Auditorium.

Nearly 50 people attended the
meeting, sponsored by Marquette
Bowman, currently a board candidate
for SGB, to address concerns about the
status of life on Pitt’s campus.

“We complain, whine, fuss and
attack the aspects of the University we
don’t like, but we do nothing more
than that,” Bowman said. “Little do
we realize that we’re part of the prob-

lem.  We needto take advantage of

this [meeting] to let administrators
know what we need as students.”

Representatives from the hous- A

ing, parking and transportation, stu-
dent affairs, and student activities
offices were on hand to ﬁeld questions
from the audience and ask a few ques-
tions of their own.

‘ Candidates for SGB positions,
current SGB officers and members of
student organizations like CWO,
BAS, and The Pitt News talked with
them about issues like the cramped
housing conditions, problems with the
student H), and complaints about food
services.

The overwhelming response
from administrators was that they have

may be to blame for all the troubles. -
While addressing concerns ﬂiat

students weren’t consulted about insti-

tuting the new PittCards, Dennis
Donham, vice—chancellor of student
affairs, said that students and adminis-
trators should both realize that in a
place as large as Pitt, it’s diﬂicult to
receive input from everyone affected
by a certain decision.

“The University is a very large‘
place, and some people and adn1inis—
trators fall through the cracks when
these issues come up,” Donham said.

Cocaine found in Colombian tanker

Across the World

TUZLA, Bosnia-Herzegovina — U.S.
troops seized over 1,000 riﬂes from sol-
diers of the Bosnian Army’s 254th brigade
last Thursday. The weapons were seized
because the Bosnian army had taken part in
ﬁghting in a demilitarized zone patrolled by
NATO—led forces near the village of Gajevi.

NATO officials claim that the seizure
itself adds to the proof that the 254th
brigade was involved in the ﬁghting.
“There is no doubt in our minds that mem-
bers of 254th brigade were on the scene,
were engaged in the ﬁghting, and were
involved in the arming and supporting of
the crowd who marched to Gajevi,” said
Maj. Simon Haselock, a NATO spokesman
in Sarajevo. Haselock said that NATO

troops seized at least 50 fewer guns than
had been found in an earlier search of the
compound — demonstrating that at least
some of the guns had been used in ﬁghting
or given to civilians to continue the ﬁght-
ing. Associated Press

Across the Nation

NEWARK, NJ. —— Customs officials say
that a 750—foot Colombian oil tanker enter-
ing the U.S. had more than black liquid on
board. Two stowaways had swum under
the tanker when it was beginning its trip
and holed up in the ship’s rudder compart-
ment. The men were found in the hollow
during a routine search -— which also
found 100 pounds of cocaine. Associated

set up a system to draw criticism.”

Donham said he doesn’t think adminis-
trators intentionally ignore student opinion,
but few students voice their opinions to the
people who can atfect change.

Most people at the meeting agreed that
one of the main problems at Pitt is that there
are so many students and administrators that
few people know with whom to discuss their
conoems.

Betsy Sallade-Farina, director of food
services, received several complaints about
the block plan and
food quality at the
meeting, and

the students’ ques-
tions about her pro-

BAS President
C r e i g h t o n
Moorehead and
SGB presidential
candidate Mark
Friedberg both ques-
tioned the policy of
charging students
more money for their
blocks than they are worth.

Farina said she understands the concern,
but added it is necessary to charge more to
fund certain “academic programs” and keep
places like Sutherland cafeteria open.

Another concem was that students lose
money on a $4.50 block when their pur-
chases amounts to less than that

Farina said food services is looking into
a way to calculate that amount to make up
for that “lost” money in the upcoming year.
She encouraged more input on the quality of
her department, but said she’s noticed little
interest from students.

“I don’t know if it’s student apathy or
some other problem, but I haVen’t been get-
ting much response ﬁom students,” she said.
“We have to put together student focus
groups to address student concerns. We can
only feed the students what you tell us
you’re interested in eating.”

 

  

 

Lauren Leiter, SGB board member, said
she’s heard a lot of students’ concerns about
food services, and that SGB is a good outlet

. for the administrators toconnect with the

student population.

“If you need someone on your commit-
tees we know of people who’ll help you and
be glad to voice their concerns,” she said.

Bob Hopkins, director of housing ser-
vices, said students need to know more
about otf-campus housing that the universi-
ty provides, and take advantage of the
 resources provided to

“My oﬂice now

provides rental guides
for the Oakland area that
list all [Pitt] oﬂ’-campus
facilities that some peo-
ple _ may not know
about,” he said.
V Joe Cavalla,
director of student activ-
ities, asked the audience
what they thought was
the best way to commu-
nicate between adminis-
trators and students.

“When you come into the student
union, do you look at bulletin boards? Is The
Pitt News a viable outlet of infonnation?” he
asked. “We’Ve got a lot of ways to commu-
nicate, but I don’t know that there’s a central
place we can get together and discuss
things.” ’ 2

Many from the audience said newspa-
pers and ﬂiers are the best way for the groups
to keep in touch, and organizers of the event
said more meetings like this one are needed
so students and administrators can share
ideas.

“The most important thing tonight was
communication,” event organizer Marquette
Bowman said. “We need to make our prob-
lerns open to administrators, and also let stu-
dents know what programs and opportuni-
ties are out there. Then we can put these
things in students’ faces and say ‘Look! Here
it is! Do something!”’

SGB

He added that students are already
paying for these programs in their tuition,
and SGB implementation of them is sim-
ply serving to charge students twice.

DalMolin said he felt offering pro-
grams for students is, in fact, one of the
reasons for the existence of SGB. He said
he was not convinced that programs such
as the Internship Seminar would have
occurred without backing from the SGB.

“A collective effort is what’s neces-
sary, and the tool for that is the SGB. We
are supposed to represent the general
interest of the student body,” said
DalMolin.

Although DalMolin and Friedberg
both cited experience as a key reason why
students should vote for them, students
such as Todd Neufeld and The Pitt News’
editor-in-chief Ben Jackson questioned
them on the practicality of their plans.

“We’ve heard a lot about your expe-
riences and goals and strategies, but in the
day-to—day things get lost. Being a board
member is certainly different than being
president,” said Jackson.

Because of this, Jackson told the can-
didates he was concerned their “well-
thought—out goals” would become lost in
the shufﬂe of their new position.

Neufeld had similar concerns, and
noted that issues such as improved com-
munication between the SGB and stu-
dents, that DalMolin called for, have been
proposed in the past to no avail. He asked
the candidates what made their plans
unique.

Friedberg said that his plan to
restructure the board would forge a
stronger communication link between
board members and students. Under his
presidency, Friedberg said each of the
eight board members would be responsi-
ble for interacting with four student
groups a week. This way, board members
would be held accountable for their
actions.

But DalMolin balked at the idea of
expecting SGB members to attend four
meetings a week.

“It sounds like a hell of a lot more
bureaucracy to Inc,” said DalMolin.

He said he would appoint someone in
his administration to maintain the ﬂow of
infomiation entering the SGB ofﬁce.

Christa Douaihy, a member of CW 0
running for SGB, was incensed by the
fact that neither of the presidential candi-
dates nor an SGB liaison had attended
any CWO meetings this semester to
address their concerns.

In a follow-up interview she went on
to say that she was upset by The Pitt
News ’ endorsement of specific" candidates
for SGB. She said she feared that the
thousands of students who did not come
to hear the candidates speak would rely
solely on the judgement of the paper.

“What the The Pitt News has done is
analogous to ﬁve people on the editorial
board electing one president for thou-
sands of students,” said Douaihy.

Students can vote for SGB president
on Wednesday, Nov. 20.

stretches the student activities’ alloca-
tion.

“Often we can get a block of seats
[at a concert] and just charge the face
value of the ticket,” Misuraca said.
“Charging a minimal fee at some
events helps us to provide about three
times the amount of programming as
we could with only our allocation.”

While $326,000 may seem like a
large amount, the going rate of speak-
ers can range anywhere from $30,000
to $90,000 for a single presentation.

“Colin Powell runs in at about
$60,000  George Bush and George
Foreman want $50,000 to speak,” said
Misuraca.

Misuraca said that when the Pitt
Program Council decides to provide
students with an activity, they try to
offer programs that will serve the entire
campus community.

“We take that 35 percent of the
activities fee that we are allocated and
try to turn it into a lot of events that
appeal to a lot of people,” he said.

While the Pitt Program Council is
responsible for providing the largest
amount of entertainment to the general
campus community, it receives around
$124,000 less than the student activities

allocations committee.

The student activities allocations
committee oversees and makes recom-
mendations to the Student Government
Board for the disbursement of around
$450,000 to the over 120 campus-wide
clubs, organizations, and governance
groups that request funding.

Members are selected from an
application process which draws from
students in the campus community.
Applications for committee positions
are currently being accepted at 639
William Pitt Union through 5 p.m. this
Friday.

“There is a lot of competition for
seats on the [student allocations] com-
mittee,” said Milani. “It’s a very presti-
gious position, and that is reﬂected in
the number and quality of applicants.”

Once selected, the members sit
through a training workshop and are
then left to operate under a set of well-
documented policies and procedures
which review" organizational applica-
tions for funding.

“This is a system designed to max-
imize the student role in decision-mak-
ing,” said Milani. “Everyone under-
stands [his] role and plays by the
rules.”

presidential endorsement

The Pitt News announced its endorsements for Student
Governrnent Board yesterday. Today, we present our pick for SGB
president And the honor goes to  Mark Friedberg. -

After holding discussions last Friday with each of the candi-
dates for president, we feel that Friedberg is the best man for the job.
While not always the most eloquent in public appearances, his deal-
ings on a personal level show that he can get things done.

First of all, his idea that SGB should be more concerned with
the policy of this University, rather than spending most of its time
andresourcesonprogramsthatcouldarrdshouldbesponsoredby
other student groups or University departments, is a good start
Though The Pitt News would like to point out the danger of com-
pletely ignoring the programming aspect of the Board, we feel that

the SGB, as the student government board, should be mainly con-
cerned with changing the policies of Pitt to be more st1rdent-ﬁiend-

ly. .
One of the ways Friedberg intends to make Pitt more student-

I friendly is through simpliﬁcation. He plans to cut through as much

red tape as possible to simplify such aspects of student life as regis-
tration and the allocations process. ‘

The more time that other student groups and University orga-
nizations are running the programs, themore time that is freed up
for Board members to concentrate their eiforts on helping solve the
problems of everyday student life. Spearheading one program can
often dominate all of a Board member’s time for an entire semester.
Byon1yhelpingothergnoupswithprograms,tlristirnecanbeset
aside for other goals.

We were also impressed with Friedberg’s experience in dealing
wiﬂ1theadrninistration.Hec1mentlyhasseatsonboththeSenate
Council and the University Senate. He regularly interacts with the
chancellor and vice chancellors. The way for students to gain
inroads into the administration is to forge relationships with mem-
bers of the admrnr' 'stratiorL ‘

We wish Mark the best of luck in his campaign. Students, don’t
forget to go out and vote in the elections on Wednesday, Nov. 20.

THE P|'I"l' NEWS

Random events woke us out of stupor

 

Randomness in the universe is
disturbing. One minute you are in
your nice comfortable personal
reality, then something completely
random and non-sequitur happens.
Subsequently, we are retumed to the
present in a rather abrupt manner.

Last week I talked about this
phenomena in respect to. infatuation
and relationships, but the experi-
ences I have had this past week
have led me to believe that this phe-
nomena is slighﬂy more universal.
We are so caught up in our cozy lit-
tle comers of the world that it takes
these completely random events to
bring us out of our self-deluding
stupor. Every once in a great
while, I am reminded that there is a
world outside my brain. This world
normally has no effect on me, and
certainly I have no effect on it.
Though I profess to be well
informed and thoughtful about the
ills of human society, to some extent
it is all lip-service. I still go through
life every day eating my corn ﬂakes
for breakfast and trying to decide
what the hell I’m going to do after
graduation. Not to mention my
even more immediate petty con-
cerns like what I’m going to eat for
lunch. The fact that I
think the best form of govemment
is a socialistic democracy is irrele-
vant. I eat, drink, sleep and live the
tenets of capitalism. As I sit deeply
engaged in a philosophical discus-
sion about the evils of capitalism
and social Darwinism, I order a

pizza and marvel at the capitalistic

convenience which my capitalistic
money can buy. Capitalism is part
of my personal reality, whether I
like it or not. The randorrmess in this
liesintlrefacttlratlarnsoabsorbed
in my thoughts and almost never
wake up enough to realize my
hypocrisy. It takes something like
an insane man in Wendy’s smoking
section uttering random phrases and

talking about strong, forceful voices.

inhisheadtomakemerealizethat
there is a world outside my head
and it is in a signiﬁcantly abhorrent
state of disarray.

On a more morbid note, I was
reminded of my own mortality this
weekend in a rather abrupt manner
by receiving news that a good
friend of mine from high school
was dead. He was a volunteer ﬁre-
man on the way to a call. He was
stopped at a red light when he was
rear-ended by another car so vio-
lently that he died instantly. This
guy was one of the most brilliant
people I know. His SATs were in the
1400s, and in high school, his GPA
was above perfect. He was also one
of the most selﬂess people as well.
Despite his taxing college schedule
he still found time to serve his com-
munity as a volunteer ﬁreman.

What is disturbing about this is
not that he died, it is the random
manner in which it occurred.
“There but for the grace of God go
I,” or anyone else. The guy was
going to the ﬁre in an orderly and
calm manner when wham! out of
nowhere, a totally unrelated event
occurs and cost the world one of its
better inhabitants. Chaos and ran-
domness in the world have no prej-

udice and take no prisoners.
Whether we think so or not, we are
at their mercy. I like my cornfort-

able reality and when it is thrown '

off-kilter, so am I.

As much as I hate having my
own personal reality thrown out of
whack, in a strange sort of way I am
glad that they are happening. These
seemingly random events make me
much more considerate and careful
with respect to others and their situ-
ations. One realizes that there may
be perfectly logical circumstances
behind the closing down of these

places and others have their own

separate lives to deal with. The fact
that these things probably happen
for a reason seems to take away any
justiﬁcation for being angry due to
inconvenience. .

As far as my friend is con-
cerned, there is no way his death
can seem reasonable or understand-
able. But one can take away a
newer sense of caution and wari-
ness. There is an outside world (as
surprising as this might be) and
sometimes it comes crashing down
into the forefront of our minds. I
think the results of randomness
would be less severe if attentiveness
and observation were raised to a
higher level. I can’t decide which
group to start —— F.A.R., Foundation
for Abolishing Randomness; or
F.A.R., Foundation for Advocating
Randomness. Despite its disturbing
nature, randomness is sort of useful,
but I think we’d be better off com-
bating it with awareness.
Jay DeMar1ino thinks that all the
world should join in the “Fight
Entropy ” campaign.

SOUTH BEND, Ind. — This
weekend’s voyage to Notre Dame
proved to be a truly religious experi-
ence. But I didn’t go to mass or con-
fession with the priests and monks at
South Bend. No, Notre Dame is
much more than the most-recognized
Catholic school in the country — it
is the epitome of college football,
truly the apex of the entire sport.

' Yes, I admit, I did hit myself
after saying “holy &%@l’’ at the
incredible sight of the 12-story
Touchdown Jesus. But the sight of
the Golden Dome, considered the
most—recognized landmark of any
college campus, truly caused me to
desire a rosary for prayer. The sight
of the shiny golden glow amidst the
ominous November night sky simply
was too much to bear. After seeing
the sight numerous times on TV,
viewing it in person caused me to
stop and marvel with my mouth
agape, looking skyward like a child
who sees a skyscraper for the first
time.

The spectacle of Notre Dame
Stadium was dampened somewhat
by the massive construction vehicles
that didn’t gel with the rustic ambi-
ence of the campus. But/once inside,
the stadium took on a completely
different feel. This was the feel, I
thought, that every stadium should
have: a 59,000-capacity grass sta-
dium that had the feel of a high-
school stadium, with stands all
around the field and the fans practi-
cally on top of the field. It was gen-
uinely a celestial experience.

So if you ever get a chance to go
to Notre Dame, please, count your
blessings. And don’t, swear at
Touchdown Jesus.

The highly anticipated
coming-out party for the Pitt
basketball team proved to be
worth the wait. Last Friday
night, the Panthers easily
handled Marathon Oil,
cruising to a 82-65 victory.

The Panthers controlled
the tempo of the game from
the opening tipoff. Their
relentless full—court press
created nine first half
turnovers by Marathon. The
game opened with the teams
trading fast breaks, but nei-
ther team converted. It took
3:50 before either team got
on the scoreboard. A layup
from 21-year-old freshman
Kellii Taylor put Pitt up 2-0,
and the Panthers never
trailed. ‘Taylor led Pitt with
18 points for the game.
Marathon Oil didn’t score
until the 5:13 mark when
Mike Mitchell, who had a
team-high 18 points, nailed
a jumper.

The horrendous shoot-
ing continued throughout the
ﬁrst half for both teams. Pitt
shot 36 percent from the
field in the , first half.
Marathon was even worse,
hitting on just 26 percent of
their shots‘.

“The major thing is we
got our stage fright out of
the way, especially in that
first half,” said Pitt Head

THE PI'I"l' NEWS

Tuesday, November ‘I9, 1996

Marathon Oil can't handle men's hoops

Coach Ralph Willard.
“And we started three
sophomores and a fresh-
man.”

The cold feet theme

seemed to be the most com-

mon explanation for Pitt’s
first half shooting perfor-

- mance.

“It was the first game.
We all had some jitters, and
the shots just wouldn’t fall,”

Isaac Hawkins’ ten points and eight rebounds
came in just 19 minutes. ~

Taylor said. “Coach told us
to have fun. The jitters
should be over now.”

The jitters were over by
the second half. With just a
32-27 lead at halftime, the
Panthers calmed down in the
second half. The tempo was
more controlled, and a com-
pletely different Pitt team
dominated the second half
by nailing 57 percent of its

field goals. The most dra-
matic was a layup by an air-
borne Taylor off a perfectly-
placed pass from Vonteego
Cummings. That gave Pitt a
14-point lead with 14:04 to
play. The Panther lead slow-
ly stretched to a peak of 23
points with 7:06 left in the
game.

The foul line kept
Marathon in the game. They
were 11 of 15 from the line
in the first half. The Panthers
took just four foul shots,
making only one. Things
didn’t get any better in the
second half. Marathon went
10 for 13 in the second half.
Pitt made its only two sec-
ond—half . free-throw
attempts.

“The thing that disap-
pointed me more than any-
thing else tonight was we
didn’t get to the free-throw
line. That was a big problem
we had last year and it hap-
pened again tonight,”
Willard said. “We’ve got to
get to the free, throw line.
The way you do that is by
having your big people take
the ball to the rack.”

That situation should be
helped when Chad Vargas
returns to the lineup. He did
not dress for Friday’s game
due to a stress fracture, but.
should be available by the
time Pitt’s real season opens
next Sunday against Illinois
State.

Pitt’s women’s basketball
team opened its season with an
exhibition game against the
Lithuanian junior team, and
though the final ended up in
Lithuania’s favor, 69-58, the
score doesn’t tell the whole

story.

Just as Coach Kirk Bruce
promised, he got everyone into
the game early and often gave
many of the younger players

some game experience.

The game -started well for
the Pitt. They took an early 17-

Gold outruns Blue in annual Blue-Gold track meet

 

It may be hard to put stock in a
track meet where people sing “Hail to
the Redskins” over the loudspeaker.
Make no mistake about this one,
though — Pitt’s blue-gold meet means
something. The gold team won Pitt’s

10th-annual intrasquad meet last
Sunday by a 113-87 score, but that’s
not what this meet is abc ut.

“It’s like a family rivalry thing.
You want your brother to do good,_ but
at the same time, you ivant to kick his
butt,” said blue tearr Captain Orrel
Green.

After the meet, everyone is family

was so ineffective in their zone
offense that Bruce chose to run a
man-to-man offense, which got a
little more going for Pitt.

The second half proved more
promising for Pitt. They hung in the
game and began clawing their way
back. Pitt outscored the foreigners
38-28 in the second half.

Pitt center Melissa Thompson
scored a game-high 15 points, fol-
lowed by Agne Abromaite of
Lithuania with 14.

Pitt finally worked the ball
inside, and every time the ball
ended up in the paint, the inside
players made something happen.

The Lady Panthers were able to '

make passes and finish plays.
The 2-3 zone made a difference.
“Our returning players have a

feel for this defense,” Bruce said. .

‘_‘The younger players will have it
down by the first game.”

Apparently, the younger players
are getting the hang of the defense
that shut down Lithuania for much
of the second half.

It also helped that
Baranauskaite went out with five
fouls. Her loss limited the inside
game, and Lithuania’s tough dou-
ble—team defense. Pitt took advan-
tage and shot 52 percent in the sec-
ond half.

Bruce said the Panthers won a
lot of mini—games that he was
watching very closely. These exhi-
bition games are a chance to work
on little things and the Lady
Panthers did that.

“You cannot prepare for foreign

gteams,” he said. “Their 6-foot-3

girl played like their 5-foot-5 girl.
They could both drive to the bas-

' ket.”

The Panthers will start the reg-
ular season on Friday night against
Virginia at the Field House.

again. Members of both teams take laps
together with pizza and pop in hand.
Fun is a primary component of the
meet, but there is tough competition
too.

“The team looks real good. This
isn’t like a regular meet. You have to do
everything within three hours. A lot of
people were tired, but nobody quit,”
Green said.

Green was one of the participants
in the day’s most exciting race, the
men’s 600 meters. Green led the race
for about 599 meters, but was nosed
out at the finish by freshman Carl
Taylor. Taylor’s time was 1:22.13, .02
ahead of Green.

“After a quarter mile, he looked

weak. I’m more of a middle-distance
runner than he is. I’ve been training for
that kind of race,” Taylor said.

Taylor was also on the gold team’s
winning mile relay team, consisting of
freshman Jeremy Ward, senior Jerel
Williams, sophomore Tim Tyre, and
Taylor. The team finished in 3:25.45.

Several freshmen took advantage
of their first chance to compete. Brian

Richard won the men’s high jump with

a jump of 6-6. He also won the pen-
tathlon with 3283 points. Close behind
was freshman Brian Johnson with 3225
points. Johnson was the winner in the
long jump with 20-3 1/2. A

New meet records were set in the
weight throw for both men and women.

Rashida Daniels set the new women’s
mark with a throw of 44-6 3/4. Ron
Losiewicz’s 44-2 set the men’s record.
Losiewicz also won the shot put with a
throw of 44 feet.

Sophomore Trecia Smith wonthe
shot put with 42-9 1/4 and the high
jump with 5-4. Smith was also on the
victorious gold mile-relay team, along
with freshman Shantee Earl, senior
Jennifer Williams, and sophomore
Nina Carter. Williams was also the
winner of the 50—meter hurdles with a
time of 6.56 seconds.

Pitt’s distance runners, fresh off the
district cross-country championships,
