Faculty retirement packag

Pitt professors
voice frustration
over delay an
incentive package

Melissa Blackwood
’ Staff Wrlter

The saga of the proposed retire-
ment—incentive package, which has
been in the works for nearly two
years, continued last night as sever-
al Pitt professors voiced frustration
with what they describe as the
University's lack of action.

An ad hoc committee of faculty
members and administrators sub-
mitted the plan to the chancellor in
June but haven't heard anything
since.

University Senate President
Gordon Macleod told members at
last night's Faculty Assembly meet-
ing that he believes the issue will
be on the Board of Trustees’ agenda
in October. ‘

However, that did little to alle— A

viate the anxiety of professors who
had hoped to have a retirement-
incentive package in place by Sept.
1.

"I think we are entitled to more
than just the secrecy and the ten-
sion," said Herb Chesler, professor
of economics.

At the urging of several faculty

members, Macleod agreed to ask’

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg to
address the status of the package at
next week's Senate Council meet-
mg.
The plan endorsed by ‘the
Faculty Assembly in June would
offer cash bonuses of up to 2.5
times the tenured professors‘ annu-
al salary if they retire within the
next three years.

They could then be replaced by
younger, lower-paid faculty. ,

Also last night at the meeting,
faculty members investigating the
relationship between Pitt and the
University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center Systems reported they are
slowly gaining a better understand-
ing of the way the UPMCS works.

But, they added, their efforts
are being stymied by the head of
the UPMCS. '

Former Senate President Keith
McDuffie formed the committee
last spring to study the compatibili-
ty of the UPMCS with the

University, especially the School of ‘

Medicine.

Many people within -the
University community are con-
cerned that the UPMCS' for-profit
goals are not always compatible
with Pitt's educational goals.

According to Chairman Nathan
Hershey, committee members have
met with the chancellor, the interim
dean of the medical school and sev-
eral other key people from the med-
ical school.

However, the president of the
UPMCS, Jeff Romoff, has declined
to talk to committee members.

Without Romoffs input, said
Hershey, several questions remain.

For example, the committee has
learned that some sort of task force
has been created to make recom-

mendations about the relationship
between Pitt and the UPMCS.

The details, though, remain
murky.

"We don't know who is on the
board because Jeff Romoff won't
meet with us," explained Hershey.

"We know from talking to peo-
ple at the School of Medicine that it
isn't any of them,"~he added.

Romoff was not ‘available for
comment. _

These kinds of questions are
not unique to Pitt, however.

Several other research universi-
ties and medical schools across the
country are also trying to figure out
how to adapt to a rapidly changing
health-care environment.

Macleod summed it up: "Let
me remind you that this is a moving
target. Nat Hershey's committee
has done an excellent job, but
things are going to continue to
change at UPMCS."

Across the Nation

BATON ROUGE,‘ La. —— Donald Hunt
nearly died after a night of heavy drinking,
and his roommate, Benjamin Wyrme, did
die.

Now Hunt is suing Louisiana State
University, his fraternity, and the bar where
the drinking took place, for negligence.

Hunt says the fraternity forced him and
the other pledges to drink huge amounts of
alcohol.

He says the bar is negligent because its
employees could have stopped the drinking.

And Hunt says the university has failed
to regulate the tradition.

An attorney for LSU says the institu-
tion is not legally liable.

Wynne was 20 — the same age as Hunt
— and the legal drinking age in Louisiana is
21. ‘

SAN FRANCISCO — As San Francisco

life such as relationships, work habits,
and other daily functions.

The factors in the onset of this disor-
der are not yet known, said Malkoff-
Schwartz, but it may have a strong genet-
ic link.

The element of inconsistency and the
demands of college life -— which_many
students ﬁnd manageable —— can trigger
mania in someone who has bipolar disor-
der.

“If you have this disorder, there are
risks you can’t take that other people can
take,” says Frank. “You can’t stay up late
studying or watching TV.”

Malkoff-Schwartz and her col-
leagues studied the events in the lives of
39 people with bipolar illness. —

They -found that 65 percent of

Around the World

MONTROUIS, Haiti —— Divers have seen
the bodies of more than 100 people trapped
on two decks of a sunken ferry in Haiti.

There had been reports that hundreds
more people had been on board and that
they may also have drowned. But the divers
are indicating that the ferry may not have
been as overcrowded as those reports
seemed to indicate.

Officials say 276 tickets were sold for
the ferry trip. Fifty survivors swam to shore
yesterday after the feny went under. About
50 bodies have been recovered, and divers
say they've counted between 100 and 115
other bodies in the two lower decks.

Some locals are blaming the tragedy on

boat owners.

Docs soy ’Never underestimate the power of prevention’

Hillary Stevenson
Staff Wrlter

Every year thousands die from
diseases which have known vac-
cines.

Two national surveys say over

half of those deaths are preventable

if doctors are given adequate train-
ing in the administration of those
vaccinations as preventive medicine.
Faced with these facts, a Pitt
medical professor and his colleagues
developed a program that gives doc-
tors better training in teaching their
patients about the importance of
vaccinations and immunizations.

The Teaching Immunization for
Medical Education program is a cur-
riculum aimed at stressing the
importance of immunizations and
vaccinations to medical profession-
als during their education, reports
Dr. Richard Kent Zimmerman of
Pitt's medical school.

Zimmerman led the development
of the program in 1993 in response
to research done by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta, Ga., and the Association of
Teachers of Preventive Medicine.
The findings of the two groups
showed that there was a lack of suf-
ficient knowledge in the area of pre-
ventive medicine among both med-

ical students and practicing doctors.

Zimmerman said approximately
65,000 people die each year from ill-
nesses such as pneumonia, hepatitis
B and the ﬂu.

''Half of those deaths could have
been prevented"
Zimmerman said.

The need for pro-
grams such as
Zimmerman's are des-
perately needed to pre-
vent unnecessary
deaths from occurring,
according to the CDC.

"Through surveys
we conducted with the
Association of
Teachers of Preventive
Medicine, we were
given the impression
that there is not ade-
quate information on
preventive medicine or
vaccinations," said Dr.
Ray Strikas of the
CDC's National Immunization
Program. "We assessed what was
being taught and found that there
were great deficiencies."

According to Strikas, adults are
the most likely to go without vacci-
nations. Most school districts across
the country make sure that children

He said    

receive the vaccinations they need,
but no one does the same thing for
adults, Strikas said.

Sharon Silvestri, an administra-
tor for the Allegheny County Health
Department, agreed with Strikas and
said the unnecessary
sickness and complica-
tions from those sick-
nesses arise right here
in Pittsburgh because
people aren't required
to get immunization
shots.

"Because there are no
required immuniza-

do
them,"

not
said

generally
receive
Silvestri.
According to Donna
Weber, director of the
Immunization Office
at Pitt, students are
among those who lack
required immuniza-
tions. Since a second ﬂu vaccine
wasn't required by Student Health
Services until 1989, many students
have gone without receiving it she
said.
"[Col1ege-age] students need at
least two doses of the vaccine for
measles, mumps, and’ rubella," she

tions for adults, adults-

said. "We also urge students to
receive the hepatitis B series as well
as a tuberculosis shot and a tetanus
shot."

If SHS discovers a student does
not have the needed immunizations,
that student will not be able to regis-
ter for next semester, Weber added.

Guillermo Cole, spokesman for
the Allegheny County Health
Department, said the department
administers primarily pneumonia
and ﬂu vaccinations. And of those
who do receive vaccinations, he said
a large percentage are elderly.

"We still don't have 100-percent
coverage," Cole said. He attributed
the failure of many adults to get vac-
cinated to being unaware that their
physician advocates immunizations,
to not having a physician or to sim-
ply not knowing the vaccinations are
out there. i

"We need to do a better job of
persuading a-nd explaining to people
the importance of vaccinations,"
Cole said. '

And, said Zimmerman, that's the
point of his curriculum: to heighten
this awareness among doctors and
patients alike.

"That is why we need new meth-
ods to teach preventive medicine,"
Zimmerman said. '

National park lands
are becoming oil fields

It now seems to be only a matter of time until
Schenley Park and the Cathedral lawn become oil
fields.

On Monday, the U.S. Bureau of Land
Management approved exploratory oil drilling on a
site in national park land in Utah — on the very same
area that President Clinton designated to be protect-
ed last year.

This is very wrong. It means that nothing is
sacred, and lands that are designated as such by our
president are not safe in the face of “development”
——- that is, greedy industrialists. It may even mean
our president’s word is meaningless in the face of
our government’s bureaucracy, and that’s scary.

Drilling oil wells in that area is going to destroy
the ecology and the natural beauty of the place. For
anyone who doesn’t quite understand environmental
lingo, here’s the translation: Drilling will destroy the
things in this world that people want but that cannot
be rebuilt.

Who cares about ecology, you ask? Well, just
imagine this campus without any grass or trees, and
maybe you’ll get the idea. It would be ugly and col-
orless, but at least we’d have oil for our cars. '

And that’s the most important thing, isn’t it? Oil.
As long as we can save 2 cents on a gallon of gas,
who cares whether there are any national parks left?

That is the way things may go because this
approval sets a precedent. It says that national parks
are not protected from the greedy hands of industry,
and if the parks are not, then what is? Nothing.

We urge you to write to your congressmen. It is
generally accepted that one letter is the opinion of at
least four other people. Pennsylvania’s senators are
Rick Santorum and Arlen Specter, and William
Coyne and Frank Mascara are the representatives for
Pittsburgh. Tell them you want our protected lands to
be safe from asphalt and steel. Tell them you may
want’ somewhere to go on vacation someday when
the beaches are all covered with a thick, black slick.

Tell them you want your country back from the
billionaires.

Tell them that you care.

since classes started and already
things had begun to sour, espe-
cially what was left of the gallon
of milk in my reﬁigerator.

Though it was still a whole
day before the “Best if used by”
date stamped on the jug, my milk
was already well on its way to
becoming some other  signiﬁ-

cantly more solidiﬁed rnefr’iber'of ‘ ‘

the ' dairy-"product family.
Needless to say, pouring it onto
my Frosted Flakes at seven in the
morning was not exactly when,
where or how I’d prefer to dis-
cover this anomaly. I

Two things became instantly
clear to me as I looked at the cur-
dled globules which stared back
at me as if to say,“What the heck
are you doing up this early in the
morning ?”: A

First, I had to ﬁnd a humane
way to get rid of the brand new
ecosystem I had inadvertently
fertilized and ensured four more
generations of life in by pouring
it on-my sugar-encrusted cereal.

Second, I had to geta new
cereal bowl.

You know, a stamp—marked
“Best if used by August 31,
2001” would have been just as
truthful as the one on the milk
container in my trash can.

As I carried out a trash bag to
the dumpster at arm’s length -
in a similar manner that the CDC
carries bags of bio-hazardous
waste to the incinerators which
burns cute little things like Ebola
and the black plague — I trem-
bled as a horriﬁc realization sud-
denly hit me:

The Pitt News

It was time to go grocery
shopping again.

This, of course, just a day-
and-a-half after the Giant Eagle
on Forbes Avenue packed its last
blue bag of student groceries and
shut down forever.

In an never-ending attempt
to evade the Sunday checkout
lines (which each look a lot like
the line to get on Kennywood’s
“Steel Phantom” on Memorial
Day), I set out in the cool 10 p.m.

a nightfaair to .the_ closest 24-hour
W grocery store I knew of.’ -
After an eventful" 30-minute*

drive of dodging oncoming vehi-
cles — most packed with people
decked out in black and gold
clothing whooping rowdy cheers,
mooning passers-by out the back
window and waving empty beer
cans — I ﬁnally arrived in the
grocery store’s parking lot. (I
realize the Steelers’ last-minute,
14-13 victory over Washington
was a nice surprise, but you’d
think the Pittsburgh Police could
act a little more professional
while driving in their squad cars.)

It’s times like these when I
realize human beings are, with-
out a doubt, creatures of habit.

When some people wake up,
they reﬂexively grope for that
ﬁrst cup of coffee. Others instinc-
tively grab a snack everyday at
3:45, sharp. For me, walking
through a grocery store’s front
door triggers a memory of the
mountain of coupons resting
beside my reﬁigerator back at my
apartment.

At 11 p.m., shopping with
America’s upper crust crumbles
to shopping with America’s most
wanted — deﬁnitely not an experi-
ence for the weak-at-heart.

A student's adventures buying milk

The only people in a grocery
store after 10:30 p.m. are: a)
employed there b) evading a
Pennsylvania State Police swat
team c) drunk (1) on heavy med-
ication e) neurotic columnists f)
people who just got off 39—and-a-
half-hour shifts in some factory
and act like they should be evad-
ing a Pennsylvania State Police

- swat team or g) any combination

of the above.
I scarnpered through aisles
blockaded by stacks of food

A marked “Buy these or we won’t

let you leave the store alive!” and
other snappy marketing logos.
On my way through the
store, I entered the bulk depart-
ment — where I have heard
vicious rumors that some people
just sit there and eat more items
than a busload of senior citizens
at a Atlantic City Casino buffet.
Several minutes later I emerged
with a bag of 12 cents worth of
raisins and a dried apricot. (I
would have bought more, but I
didn’t particularly care for the
trail mix  or the Oreo cookies 

or the pretzel rods.)
Soon enough, my cart,
which moments before had only

carried enough crumpled and
hacked-up advertising circulars
to make another full rim of this
newspaper possible, was laden
with ramen noodles, pasta and
other foodstuffs associated with
poverty.

But I still hadn’t found what
I came looking for.

Milk.

Rounding into the icy air of
the dairy aisle I stopped and saw
the ﬁgure at the opposite end of

Nuzzo, page 7

Conservative agenda
does not provide for
equality 

I am concerned by Marc Wisnosky’s
rousing yet vapid discourse in the Aug.

27 edition of The Pitt News on unity, - A

morals, equality and patriotism. His
opinions were stated passionately, but
were not linked logically. I am saddened
that he chose, in his tirade against the
welfare system, to focus on welfare
mothers and to completely disregard
their children who constitute two-thirds
of all welfare recipients. While I concede
that the triumphs over welfare cited by
Wisnosky do exist, I assure you that they
are not part of the reality experienced by
most welfare-dependent children.

Wisnosky preferred to deny differ-
ences in color, race and creed within the
United States. With his carefully culti-
vated tunnel vision ﬁrmly in place, how
can he hope to appreciate the differences
between people and to learn from them?
Wisnosky also glossed over the disparity
of wealth between conservative, profes-
sional America and the welfare state.
From birth, a child subsisting below the
poverty level is not equal to a middle— or
upper-class child, simply because he or
she does not have half as many resources
as his or her wealthier counterpart.
Wisnosky can claim that all are equal,
but his saying as much does not make it
so.

It is odd that Wisnosky claims
Judeo—Christian ethics as his moral
guidelines, for from the same heritage I
hear a call to provide for social justice,

-something that Wisnosky, no doubt, con-

siders unnecessary. One of the greatest
commandments is to_ love your neighbor
as you love yourself.

Only by a conscious effort to realize

equality will it be attained, and it is cer-

tainly not a part of the conservative

agenda.

 so Affirmative
Action needs to stay

I was upset to see an article in The
Pitt News about how affirmative action
should be abolished. News ﬂash!
Everything is not fine.

My mother is white and my father is
black, but from society’s point of view I
am a black woman. So I must deal with
the same prejudices, misconceptions and
biases that all other black folks go
through.

. Granted, in some instances my light-
skinned complexion can get me places
that I otherwise might not get to be. I
spent this summer as a hotel’s front—desk
clerk, and noticed one day that everyone
in the front ofﬁce was white, and the
black people who were hired were light
skinned. And of course, all the house-
keeping staff are dark—complected or
Hispanic. I couldn’t list all the times I’ve
been treated better in a store because of
my skin color than was another, more
darkly skinned sister.

Over the past year or so, I’ve talked
to some white students on campus who
were mad that there were scholarships or
grants just for African Americans that

   

they couldn’t get their hands on. Stop_
your crying. There are many African-‘
American students on this campus who
didn’t have the opportunities, the
resources and the support system that
many‘ white kids may have had.

The truth is that white people are
scared. T'l1ey’re scared that the world
may be given to them on a paper plate
instead of a silver platter. They think that
black kids didn’t earn being here. They
think it’s easier for us. Ha, think again!

Granted, the population of minority
students is‘ not as bad as Carnegie
Mellon University’s, but there is still not
enough diversity on this campus.

You need to diversify an institution
to beneﬁt its population. We need diver-
sity in the work place as well as on col-
lege campuses so that we do not live a
sheltered life.

That’s the whole point of going to
college — to meet new people of differ-
ent cultures, backgrounds and ethnicity. I
think that one of the most important
things you can learn in college is to
respect others for their differences. We
all need to break the habit of trying to put
people into categories, making assump-
tions and believing in misconceptions.
The best way to learn this is to deal with
other races on a day-to-day basis.

No one wants to slight another group
because its members are “too success-
ful,” as was mentioned about the Asian-

-American population. I agree that there

should be some reform of affirmative
action, but to do away with it altogether
is absurd. White America is not ready yet
to take it upon itself to do the right thing
and diversify the work force and college
campuses. Therefore, we must ﬁght to
keep affirmative action. We are not a
perfect society. Yes, the black communi-
ty has made many strides in the past 30

years. But guess what? It’s not over yet.

the aisle. Her hair was tousled, her
McDonald’s unifonn was rumpled and
her cart was full.

Our eyes shifted to the prize resting
halfway down the aisle — the last avail-
able gallon of milk on the shelves until

6 tomorrow moming’s precious restocking.

Our glances shot back at each other and
met in clear deﬁance.

Not since Giant and Lee clashed in a
Virginia-based trading post over smoked
deer jerky had such a battle over conve-
nience foods brewed.

Our carts drifted off to our sides. We
stood poised with an eye on each other,
straining to discern any betraying sudden

A movements. I’m not positive, but the ele-

vator music being pumped into the store
seemed to fall silent, replaced by the orni-
nous refrain in The Outlaw Josey Wales.
A tumbleweed (or maybe just a really big

. bug) rolled by on the ﬂoor.

Before I could ﬁnish twitching my

eye (to act out the western"-themed sce-
nario just a little bit more), she was three
feet from the milk. Seizing it, she offered
a demure smile in my direction.

I suddenly realized I was way too into
this whole wild west thing and now would
pay dearly for my mistake.

So instead of the convenient gallon, I
had to settle for eight little pint containers
like those you got before nap time in

A kindergarten. And instead of plastic, I

would be forced to drink out of those
funny pseudo-paper material cartons that
have been proved to cause cancer in labo-
ratory rats and never seem to open cor-
rectly without the aid of a Ginzu knife or
surgical scalpel.

I’m just glad my father wasn’t there to
see the shame I had brought upon our
family name as a kid behind the meat
counter wearing a hotdog-shaped hat
glanced into my shopping “cart and snick-
ered.

After I arrived in the only open check-
out line, I discovered - to my chagrin - that

everyone in the store‘ decided to head there
about a minute before I did.

An hour later, the cashier was swiping
the little discount card that the store had
issued me so they can see what I eat most
and send me coupons for things I’ve never
bought even once before in my life. (I’m
sure when the person responsible for look-
ing at what I’ve bought and then issuing
those coupons is a little perturbed by spo-
radic metric-ton purchases of ‘pasta
throughout Western Pemisylvania.)

I left and pulled up to my apartment

A just in time for “Good Morning America,”

unpacked my groceries, and sat down to
enjoy a nice refreshing glass of milk.

As I turned on the TV and opened the
now—warm, pint—sized carton, I looked
down just in time to see my milk ask me
what the heck I was doing up so early in
the morning.

Marc Nuzzo would rather have ﬁnished
that pint of milk than appear in one of
those milk mustache adds.

Harris-Patemo
rage in the cage

Sure, Penn State beat Pitt 34-17 last
Saturday. Sure Penn State is a better foot-
ball team than the Panthers are right now,
but who’s the better coach, the old geezer
Joe Patemo or the young and inspiring
Walt Harris?

The Nittany Lion faithﬁil will argue
that Patemo’s 290 wins make even asking
that question pointless. But should the No.

 1-ranked team beat the preseason’s 89th-
ranked team by only 17 points, coming
nowhere close to covering the spread?

Throw in the fact that had the Panthers
not missed a scrambling opportunity and
had there not been a dropped pass in the
open ﬁeld early in the game, the outcome
would have been even closer.

Because the two programs are at dif-
ferent stages right now, settling the "who’s
the better coach” debate on the ﬁeld is
impossible at this point.

But there is a more-civilized, less-bru-
tal way to determine who is the better ﬁeld
general. It’s obvious that a steel-cage
match between the two men is long over-
due.

The ﬁne institutions of professional
wrestling have used the conﬁnes of the
‘steel cage to settle disagreements between
mature, upstanding gentlemen for years.

Wouldn’t it be great? All of the issues
of Saturday’s game could be maturely dis-
cussed throughout the course of the bout.

While Harris is blistering Joey’s face
off the cage’s steel beams, Patemo will
probably try to explain that he wasn’t try-
ing to run up the score.

Then, after Harris slaps on a ﬁgure-
four leglock, Patemo could explain why, if
the Lions were indeed not trying to 11111 up
the score, was Curtis Enis still in.the game
approaching the fourth quarter with Penn
State up 34-3?

And maybe the always-classy JoePa
could tell Walt why he went for the ﬁrst
down on fourth and six well into the fourth
quarter with his team still clinging to the
same 31-point lead.

A J Then, Joey would t:ry to. tell Harris that

 Pitt’s late rally was meaningless because it
was against his second-team defense.

’ Harris would respond to that by
applying a suplex ﬁorn atop the 15-foot-
tall cage, catapulting Patemo’s 70-year-old
carcass ﬁrmly into the center of the ring,
and all the while Harris could be explain-

_ ing that Pitt had primarily ﬁelded its sec-

P ond-team offense, too.

Yeah, both men are good coaches, but

‘ my money is on Walt.

Pitt-PSU:Tai|goting with the enemy

Brian Knavish
Staff Wrlter

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. —- The traffic
reaches the bumper-to—bumper stage
about 15 miles away from Beaver
Stadium. As you sit there in gridlock, you
have lots of time to look around and take
in all of the beautiful scenery that makes
up the outskirts of State College.

Decrepit shacks line the streets and it
seems that a household is only accepted
into the community if it has at least one
disabled vehicle displayed in the front
yard. It the vehicle’s engine and mechani-
cal innards are sitting on the hood or roof,
that family becomes the envy of the entire
neighborhood.

But as you’re attempting to digest this
eye—opening dose of the local culture,
another common denominator of the local
dwellings catches your eye. Virtually
every “house” pays tribute to their
beloved Penn State Nittany Lions in one
way or another.

Penn State ﬂags, barmers, homemade
signs, and even the occasional disturbing
life-size Joe Patemo
cardboard cutout are
proudly showcased on
the property.

Even some of the
houses that don’t have any form of
Nittany Lion gala on display still show
their loyalty by having their owner stand

Cross country left in dust by Kent State

Geoff Moak
Staff Wrlter
At the ﬁrst meet of the season, the
Pitt men’s and women’s cross country
teams were content to let the other teams

run for the glory. There was competition"

at the ‘top at last Saturday’s race at Kent
State, but the Panthers were using it
largely as a training race.

Kent State won both the men’s and
women’s races. The men scored 45 points
to edge out Duquesne, 46, and Akron, 47.
Pitt’s men ﬁnished with 77 points.

In the women’s race, Kent State’s
renewed commitment to the distance-
running program was evident. They won
the race with 23 points. Pitt was second
with 34 and Akron brought up the rear
with 95.

“This is a very early season meet. We
try to train through the early season
meets. We really want to be running
faster later on,” said Pitt Head Coach

Dave Sobal.

That’s not to say
there weren’t some Pitt
runners among the
leaders. Seniors Amy
Francy ' and Lynda
Andros led the way for
Pitt’s women. Francy
ran among the leaders
for much of the race
before ‘ falling back
slightly. She ﬁnished
third for the ﬁve-kilo-
meter raoe in 20:06.

“She went in with
the intention of winning the race, and she
did lead in parts. I think she learned from
it,” Sobal said.

Andros also had a good race, but in a
different fashion than Francy. The leaders
pulled away from Andros midway
through the race. In the second half
Andros made up some of that ground on

 

the leaders, something
that generally is not

ished in 20:16 in
fourthplace.

About 45 sec-
onds behind Andros
was a pack of ﬁve
runners within nine
seconds of each other.
The pack was led by
Pitt sophomore
Lauren Fittz, who
came in seventh place
with 21:00.

“[Fittz] worked hard over the surn-
mer and she’s a lot stronger this year than
she was,” Sobal said. 7

All in all, Sobal was happy with the
women’s performance. .

“It was nice to have four women in

the top 10,” he said.

to have good food,” 1974 Penn State grad
Ellen McCullsky explained. “We used to
just throw some hamburgers or hot dogs
on the grill. But we’ve had season tickets
for 12 years now, and we’ve progressed to
this.”

The “this” she referred to was her
barbecued chicken shish—ka-bob that she
waved in her right hand. McCi1llsky’s
gameday menu included everything from
ﬁesh watermelon to three different types

- of grilled chicken meals. And, of course,
McCullsky had plenty of beer on hand
too.

“The beer’s what makes the party,”
McCullsky added.

As nauseating as this outpouring of

support for such an evil cause may be
(well, nauseating and evil when viewed
ﬁ'om behind navy blue and Vegas—gold—
colored glasses), you can’t help but
respect their spirit.
_ “We have the best fans in all college
football,” Sam Snarvock, class of 1983,
said. “I was here for the national champi-
onship in ‘82. It was insane. JoPa is a
god.”

Love ‘em or hate ‘em, Nittany Lion
fans are loyal and, in fact, are what makes
these Saturday afternoons such an event.

a harmonious chorus in singing the Penn '

State ﬁght song. ’

If you’ve never experienced this
yourself, it probably sounds corny, like
something you’d see on TV. But these
people eat it up. Unfortunately, most peo-
ple don’t even know the words to the Pitt
ﬁght song.

Actually, trying to ﬁnd a person with-
out the blue and white of a Penn State
shirt or hat on among the spirited mob is
next-to-impossible. But there is one small

sub-culture of people that fail to fully par-
take in the blue and white bonanza.

This group has no problem with the
blue but shies away from the white, pre-
ferring gold instead. This group is the
small—but—dedicated contingent of Pitt
fans who made the journey into the mid-
dle of nowhere for the game.

“Penn State ain’t nothing but a bunch
of fairies,” said Panther supporter Matt
Havel. ‘That No. 1’ ranking is bulls—t.
Give us a few years and [Head Coach
Walt] Harris will have us up there.”

The men had a rough day.

“The only surprise to me is that I was
expecting the men to show a little stronger
than they did,” Sobal said.

Injuries may have hampered the
already small men’s team. Senior Matt
Samuel ran while ﬁghting off the rem-
nants of a cold. Despite being sick, he was
still the Panthers’ second runner, ﬁnishing
13th in 22:34. Fellow senior Scott Curry
did not participate. Cuny was nursing a
leg injury and did not want to risk aggra-
vating it at a relatively unimportant early-
season meet. .

upperclassmen was freshman Mike .

Orzechowski. In his first collegiate race,
he ﬁnished ﬁfth with a time of 22:00 for
the odd distance of four miles. Normally,
men rim ﬁve mile races.

“I wasn’t expecting to be up with the
leaders,” Orzechowski said. “I just wanted
to go out and run my race and not worry
about what was going on.” _

Because the course was on a hill and
the grass was high, last Saturday’s times
were relatively slow. Next week, hills will
keep times slow again as the Panthers
travel to the mountains of West Virginia
University for a big early-season meet
against traditional cross-country power-
houses Georgetown and Virginia Tech.
