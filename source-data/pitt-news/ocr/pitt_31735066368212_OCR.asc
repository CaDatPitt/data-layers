Enrollment Down

Enrollments at private col-
leges and universities dropped
substantially, while those of
public schools increased,
according to the National Cen-
ter for Educational Statistics.

Over 27,000 more students
enrolled at public institutions
than a year ago, and 40,962
fewer students attended private
colleges and universities. If the
center’s prelimary figures are
validated, this year will be the
third time in seven years that
total college enrollment failed .
to increase. — .

Also, this fall, the number of
female and part-time students
declined, a reversal of past
trends.

NSA Recruiting

If you’re a math, computer
science, engineering or foreign
language major, a top-secret
government intelligence
agency wants you.

The A National Security
Agency recently placed ads in
The New York Times offering
students majoring in those
fields a chance to participate in
a “a world of opportunity.” A
spokesman for the agency told
The Chronicle of Higher Edu-
cation that the ads are part of
the agency’s efforts to attract
needed specialists and that it
regularly sends recruiters to col-
lege campuses.

areer Program ClosingQuestioned

By TODD ERKEL _

Members of the special commit-
tee formed to review the proposed
closing of the new careers program
question where Dean Jerome
Rosenberg has received some of his
information.

“Some of the things in the cfos-
ing proposal do not agree with the
documents I have,” said committee
member Barbara Sizemore of the
black studies program. “I don't
know if I have all the documents.”

Ronald Curry, director of the
careers program and member of the
review committee, would not com-
ment directly on the dean’s closing
proposal. “I can just tell you thatl
am preparing a counter-document
to what he has put out,” he said.

Rosenberg announced his plans
to eliminate the program, which

was begun in 1970 and is currently
administered by the University-
Community Educational‘Program
(UCEP), at a recent FAS Council
meeting.

The new careers program pro-
vides day classes for older part-time
students employed at various social
and human welfare agencies who
are pursuing bachelor's degrees at
Pitt.

“When we originally got into
this, the idea was that ours would
be a follow—up to the community
college training for the first two
years,” said Rosenberg. “I think
it’s important to see that there has
been an erosion of commitments of
several institutions.”

Allegheny Community College
closed its careers program in the
early ’70s, and, according to Rosen-

berg, some employers no longer
allow students time to attend
classes, or they require students to
make up the time or lose pay.

“I’m questioning where the dean
received that information,” said
Curry. “We haven’t had any prob-
lems with it.”

Rosenberg» wants to dismantle
the program by next summer (’83),
but he added that students now in
progresss will be allowed to com-
plete their programs. Rosenberg
also said that one of the two
teacher-counsellors now in the
program would probably be
retained.

An important question in this
debate is whether the new career
student can fit into programs now
offered by the College of General
Studies and the School of Social

The slogan on the brochure
reads, “Peace Corps.... The
toughest job you’ll ever love.”

Elizabeth McDavid said she
believes in this motto, and adds
to it, “Peace Corps is an expe-
rience that changes your whole
outlook on life.”

McDavid is presently the
recruiter for the Peace Corps at
Pitt. She is the first recruiter sta-
tioned at Pitt since 1979 and she
hopes to stimulate interest in
the program. She said. Pitt is
one ()f the few schools in the
country to have a recruiter.

“The Peace Corps is a

government agency which
sends volunteers to countries
where they are invited,”
McDavid said.

The host countries, which
consists mainly of Third World
regions, have a specific problem
or project for the volunteer to
solve, she said.

According to McI)avid, the
goals of the Peace Corps have
not changed since its inception
in 1961. She outlined three
major goals upon which the
program is built: to help needy
countries with technological
skills; to learn about other
countries’ culture and take this
knowledge back to America and

to show the developing world
that Americans are individuals,
not just business con-
glomerates.

Al_though' the Peace Corps is
a two-year program, many
volunteers choose to extend
their stay, McDavid said. “Nine ,
out of 10 volunteers say they
would do it again.”

The special aspect of the
Peace Corps program is that a
volunteer not only lives in the
country, he becomes a part of it.

“Most of the people accept
the Peace Corps volunteers very
well,” she said. “People like it
when others try to learn their

Work.

“As far as the School of Social
Work is concerned, you have (3
remember that students can not
enter until they’ve earned at least 60
credits,” Curry said. Curry said
that he is not familiar enough with
CGS to comment on whether it
provides an alternative for the new
career student.

Rosenberg feels that it does, say-
ing that the new career student
already takes part in CGS through
special course offerings.

When asked whether Rosen-
berg's proposal signals further cuts
in UCEP, Curry said, “I would_not
be surprised.”

The committee will meet with
Rosenberg Tuesday morning, at
which time it will select a chair-
man and set up a work schedule.

Students
Form Own
Alcohol
Task Force

The Resident Student Associa-
tion recently formed a task force to
recommend policies for alcohol
use on campus in response to fears
that a similar administration com-
mittee might set overly-stringent
rules.

Valerie Jachimowicz, president
of the RSA task force, said the
group will survey residents about
their alcohol use and look at alco-
hol policies on other campuses
before recommending what
changes, if any, should be made in
Pitt’s current policy.

Jachimowicz said she does not

believe there is an alcohol problem
on campus. The RSA formed the
task force, she said, because the
Office of Student Affairs formed an
administration-only group in Sep-
tember to recommend a new alco-
hol policy.
, The RSA was worried that, with-
out student participation, the task
force might propose an overly strict
policy, such as banning all alcohol
use on campus. ,_

“We wanted to propose an alco-
hol policy that would encourage
responsible use without totally
banning it on campus,” she said.

Pitt’s current policy bans under-
age students from bringing alcohol
into the residence hall and prohib-
its students from bringing more
than a case of beer or its equivalent
into the residence halls. It also
students responsible for
property damage that may occur
during a party in their rooms. ’

Vice Chancellor for Student
Affairs Conney Kimbo announced
in September that his office was
forming a committee to study alco-
hol education on campus, diagno- I
sis and treatment, available for
alcoholism and current univeristy
regulations on its use. Kimbo said
the committee did not include stu-

dents because it is a fact-finding

committee and that students would
not be involved until after the com-
mittee made its recommendations.

jachimowicz said the RSA task
force will bring its recommenda-
tions to the Office of Residence
Life next term. If its recommenda-
tions are completely ignored, “our
next step is to try and get the resi-

dent students fired up," she said.

language and culture."

In order to prepare the volun-
teer for his two-year stay, the
Peace Corps requires a three-
month training period. This
instruction comprises techiii-
cal, language and cross culture
training.

“It can be difficult to adjust;
it depends on one’s mental atti-
tude. What one learns in cross
culture will help a lot though,"
McDavid said. The volunteers
who make it through the first
six months, she said, find
adjustment during the
remainder of their stay easier.

McDavid said only one out of

‘every six Peace Corps appli-

caiits ever signs a commitment.
The Peace Corps desires that
applicants meet certain require-
ments aiid are interested.

The corps also accepts only a
set number of applicants. The
number of volunteers now
stands at 5.500, which,
McDa\'id said, is a manageable
number.

McDavid's involvement as a
recruiter originated when she
was a volunteer. She spent two
years in the African nation of
Niger as a nutrition educator
and nutritional recuperator.
Although she had no prior
training in nutrition, the Peace
Corps’ training sessions pre-
pared her for the task.

Peace Corp: Looking For Students

.\IcI)a\'id empliasi/.ed that it
takes a special type of iiidivid-
ual to join the Peace Corps-
two years is a long time.

"A volunteer must be inde-
pendent, a self-motivator and a
g()()(l‘ organizer,” she said. "He
must also know how to work
with all types of people in all
types of situations, with or
without supervision.”

The peak year for volunteer-
ing was l967. It has tapered off
since then, but McI)avid sees a
bright future for the program.

“I see it staying where it is,”
she said. “I don’t think it will be
cut in funds because Reagan
supports it.”

“We’re going to try and show
them that students are not just a
bunch of drunkards on weekends,"
she said.

A Pitt professor, however, said in
a recent speech that most college
efforts to encourage responsible
drinking and reduce alcoliol—
related problems do not work.

Education professor Howard
Blane told researchers and college
officials in Massachusetts that
social values determine drinking
among college students and that
most programs adopted by colleges
to deal with drinking fail to focus
on that.

McGovern:

Not

A Candidate?

By RAY WUSLICH

Former Senator and 1972 presi-
dential candidate George McGov-
ern is visiting college campuses
around the nation to give his views
on comtemporary issues, but his
aides say it doesn't mean McGov-
ern is considering another shot at
political office.

“Everyone asks if he is going to
run for office," McGovern’s assist-
an Ruth Claveloux said. “Right
 he has no plans to run,"

He will speak at Pitt tomorrow
night at 8 p.m. in David Lawrence
Auditorium. The lecture is spon-
sored by the Pitt Program Council.

According to Claveloux,
McGovern is likely to address spe-
cific contemporary issues such as
detente with the Soviet Union and
government-sponsored jobs
programs.

“The country’s roads, bridges
and even cities are crumbling,”
Claveloux. said. “McGovern sup-
ports government programs which
would provide jobs and rebuild the
country.”

She said the current debate over
the basing of the MX missile is not
important to McGovern.

“He does not believe in the con-
cept of the MX missile,” Claveloux

“McGovern favorsdetente with
the Soviets and believes that the
stance of the present administra-
tion regarding the Soviet Union is
not productive."

McGovern began his political
career in 1953 when he became
South Dakota’s Democratic Party
executive secretary. He was elected
to the House of Representatives in
1956 and re-elected two years later.

McGoven won a Senate seat in
1962, which he held until defeated
in the 1980 elections.

In 1969, as a member of the U.S.
Senate, McGo-vern was named
chairman of the Democratic Com-
mission on Party Structure and
Delegate Selection, and in 1972,
then-Senator McGovern became
the Democratic Party nominee for
the presidency.

He was defeated in the 1972 pre-
sidential election by Richard
Nixon. In 1976 he was appointed

Be Your Own Freeze Zone

By DANA REED

Members of Pitt's Arms Race
Study Group discussed the possi-
bility of adopting “nuclear freeze
zones" on campus as a way‘of stip-
porting the nuclear freeze
movement.

During its meeting last week,
English professor Liane Norman
said Pitt faculty could declare‘ their
departments nuclear freeze zones,
thereby limiting research or testing
of nuclear weapons it might
attempt. Norman cited Progressive
magazine as the source for the idea.

“What it boils down to is simple
principles,” Norman said. “First.
your turf is off-limits to the design,
testing, I production and use of
nuclear weapons. Second, you also
withhold your consent from any
other activitythat you feel supports
the development of nuclear
weapons.”

The third principle, Norman
said, is that you renounce whatever
right you have to be defended by
the use or threatened use of nuclear
weapons. Finally, you ask to be
taken off the target lists of any

  

  
   
   
 
 
  
 
 

    

governments that produce or con-
template the production of nuclear
weapons.

“Your own body could be a
nuclear freeze zone," Norman said.
“Declaration of a nuclear freeze
zone is a symbolic act. Collectively,
such declarations could exert a
powerful influence on the United
States and other participants in the
nuclear arms race."

Opinion

t

Battling At
The Quad

Advice after the incident is like medicine after the
funeral. But in Pitt's case, there’s more to be said
about the conflict between the two groups of foreign
students at the Forbes Quadrangle last Saturday.

A group calling itself the Islamic Union of Iraqi
Students (IUIS) planned to meet in a Forbes Quad
lecture hall to voice protests against the Iraqi
government of Saddam Hussein. Before the meeting
could begin, another group-identifying themselves
as Iraqi students loyal to the Hussein regime-arrived
at the Forbes Quad. A fight broke out between the
two groups in which two persons were injured.

Since that incident, the groups involved have
launched charges against each other and against the
university administration. Although this has been,
in large part, an emotional exchange, some impor-
tant questions have been raised. Now, as the dust
settles, Pitt students demand that these questions be
answered and that episodes of this sort do not
happen again. A complete investigation would
begin with the following points.

First, members of the IUIS have claimed that. the
group with which they tangled had been sent by the
Iraqi secret police or by groups indirectly tied to the
Hussein government to prevent the meeting taking
place. The latter group, in turn, has charged that
IUIS is made up neither of Iraqis nor of Pitt stu-
dents, but rather of Iranians from other parts of this
country who used contacts with a Pitt group—the
Muslim Student Organization—to gain access to
university facilities for their meeting. While all vio-
lent encounters on campus must be viewed as serious
matters, fights brought here by “outsiders” falsely
claiming to be Pitt students must be met with
outrage.

Next, we must wonder why those responsible for
approving the Forbes Quad.reservation were not
concerned about the possibility that an unautho-
rized group would conduct the meeting. This possi-
bility should have become apparent when
advertisements appeared for the protest bearing the
previously unknown IUIS name.

The Office of Student Activities is investigating
the matter. It is meeting with the Muslim Student
Organization to review university policies, and it
will monitor future ads to see that the same mistake
is not repeated.

It is the responsibility of the Office of Student
Activities to investigate and release the details con-
cerning who was protesting, and why the incident
occurred.

But in_g_dditioyn, to preventing future incidents, it is-
the responsibility of the Office of Student Activities
to investigate the charges that Pitt student organiza-
tions brought outside groups here to do battle on the
steps of Forbes Quad. That possibility is the most
shocking feature of the whole incident. It won’t be
easy——or wise—to brush the affair aside as no more
than a minor violation of an unimportant policy.

Bleep, Blurp, |t’s Christmas

By CHRISTINA CLINTON

Today is the end of the Thanks-
giving weekend, and the Christmas
season is upon us once again. It is
supposed to be a joyous time of the
year, filled with friends, family,
holidaycheer and peace on earth.

This Christmas, however, peace
on earth may be threatened by some
strange beings. You all know their
names: Pac-Man, Donkey Kong,
Space Invaders and other such
arcade games.

The gift to give this Christmas
appears to be the home video
games offered by such companies
as Atari, Coleco, Mattel and many
others. These companies are invad-
ing our homes with the mindless
games they seriously call “recrea-
t.ion.”

Most of these games appear to be
nothing but outlets for the violent
tendencies that seem to be taking
over this country. This time, how-
ever, instead of being only outlets,
they may also be the cause of more
violence in our society.

U. S. Surgeon General C. Everett
Koop, told a Pitt audience that
children often retain the violent
feelings they experience while
playing the games after they are
away from the machines. Televi-
sion is bad enough with all its vio-
lence; children certainly do not
need all the violence in the games
they play.

However, these games are not
just attracting children; many
adults are catching the video craze.
There is not one bar in Oakland
that does not have at least one
game. Pitt students spend hours
and their college tuition in Game
Mania and Video Playpen. With

children, we can say» they are too
young to know better; what’s the
excuse for adults?

Taverns and pubs used to be a
place for friends to meet and talk
about life over a few beers. Now, if
you can hear yourself think above
the bleeps _ and blurps of the
machines, you still cannot talk to
your friends because they are too
busy playing video games. Old-
fashioned conversation has been
replaced by a machine.

Getting back to the violent
aspects, there are a few games that
have provenzg have the potential

 

to be hazardous to our society.

Take the game Firebug. The
object of the game was to manuever
an arsonist around the screen and
see how many fires he could set.
Firemen condemned the game.
They feared that the arson rate
would increase because video-
addicts wouIdii’t be able to tell the
difference between reality and a
game.

There's also a new game out,
Custer's Last Revenge, that is made
specifically for adults. One of the
objects of the game is to see how
many Indian women that Custer,
wearing only a cowboy hat and
boots, can rape. If that’s recreation,
I ll work for the rest of my life and
forego play time. Sure, this game
probably wont be seen by many

children, but how many eight-
year-olds have ever been convicted
of rape?

This game may prove to be com-
pletely harmless to our society, but
if one deranged person commits
this act in real life because of the
game, then the game is a danger to
our society.

Video game companies are now
capitalizing on our thirst for vio-
lence. Millions of dollars are spew.
each year by people who get a kifg‘
out of blowing things up, killing
people and, basically, just destroy-
ing anything that gets in their way.

I guess I’m just an old-fashioned
person in a sense. I’m old enough

~ to remember the days before the

computer age; before the video
madness that is descending over
our lives. Life is so complicated
right now, why do our games have
to be?

I wonder if children still play
Monopoly, Scrabble or checkers.
Probably not, there’s not enough
excitement offered by those games.

The only thing they offer is the
chance to learn something. Take
the game Life, it teaches a pers .
how to manage his money while
he's handling marriage, children
and a mortgage. Real important
stuff, right? What do video games
offer educationally? Nothing, as
far as I can‘ see. How many people
do you know whose home has been
attacked by a being from outer
space or whose girlfriend has been
kidnapped by a big gorilla?

Yes, Christmas time is here once
again. I only hope that all your
homes will be filled with peace and
love this holiday season instead of
violence.

Dear Editor:

The article pul)lished in The
Pitt News on Monday, Nov. 22
entitled “Pitt Incident Mirrors
Iraq Situation" was inaccurate
and lacking in important
details.

The article suggested that the
pro-Hussein group of 50 people
were not lltiiyersity of Pitts-
burgh students and were possi-
I)ly flown in to the city to stop
the event. This is simply
untrue. I have known many of
the pro-Hussein Iraqi students

“ Protect‘ Us And Our Campus ....”

Dear Editor:

Last week, we noticed a number
of advertisements appearing in
The Pitt News and signed by the
so-called “Islamic Union of Iraqi
Students." Since we were not aware
of such an organization either in

‘the United States or in Canada, we

«sci

went to the Foreign Student’s
Office to ask about the legitimacy
of this organization and the iden-
tity'of the people affiliated with it.

The Foreign Student's Office
informed us that there is no such
organization on campus. They
directed us to the Student Activities
Office, the office that had issued
the permit for the group to use uni-
versity facilities.

We spoke with the Student
Activities Office and passed on to
them the new information about
the “Islamic: Union." They admit-
ted to us, in light of this new infor-
mation, that they had been misled
and had not been correctly
informed as to the type and pur-
pose of the Nov. 20 activity. We
then asked the Student Activities
Office to cancel permission for the
activity.

We felt that our request was

more than valid since all of the
Iraqi students enrolled at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh are opposed to
any type of activity that distorts the
truth about their country and their
government. However, the Student
Activities Office refused to honor
our request.

The lack of concern shown by
the Student_Activities Office led to
what happened on Saturday, Nov.
20, 1982, at Forbes Quadrangle. A
number of Iranian students armed
with bats, knives, sticks and
tnace—studetits from areas outside
the catnpus-—attacked the Iraqi
students who had gathered there in
an attempt to discover who these
people—who claimed to represent
then1——were. As a result of this
umprovoked attack, two of our stu-
dents were seriously injured.

We contacted the campus police,
who should be commended for
their efforts to protect students
from further harm and to prevent
these outsiders from doing even
more damage. The campus police
asked the outsiders to show any
type of document that would prove
that they were Iraqi and that they
had permission under their organi-

There Is A Limit

By DANA REED

7.vi Zoref is a 26-year-old sergeant
major in the Israeli Defense Forces
(IDF). In civilian life, he is a gradu-
ate history major in Israel.

Like many American soldiers
who served in Vietnam, Zoref said
that he felt the IDF had been misled
concerning the motives behind the
invasion of Lebanon. He said that
he feels betrayed by the leaders of
the Israeli government.

Zoref spent 37 days in
Lebanon—part of the time on the
eastern front a.gainst Syria and the
other around Beirut. He was with
an artillery and communications
unit. “In my 37 days in Lebanon, I
saw ._quite a few shocking sights,”
he told me.

One day, his unit, along with
several similar units, was posted on
the hills overlooking. the southern
quarters of Beirut, the Beirut air-
port and some Palestinian refugee
camps.

The plan, he said, was to shell
south Beirut for 12 hours from
land, air and sea enabling the IDF
to enter the city. Zoref’s unit tar-
geted the airport and the refugee
camps, according to Zoref. From
his post, he said he could see the
direct hits and the smoke. The
sight, he said, was horrifying, and
the morale of the soldiers was low.

“The knowledge that innocent
and defenseless civilians were in
there was intolerable,” he said.

Even today, months later, he told
me he finds it hard to convey the
despair and helplessness he felt
there.

When Zoref was recalled to serve
another 24 days in Lebanon, he
refused. He was tried for “refusing
an order” and sentenced to 27 days
in a military prison. He was
released after 10 days.

After his release, he joined
“There Is A Limit,” an organiza-
tion that draws its members from
among the reserve units of the IDF.
“There Is A Limit" has circulated a
petition among soldiers that calls
for an end to the war and the with-
drawal from Lebanon of all Israeli
forces. So far, 1300 soldiers have
signed.

Zoref is speaking out because he
wants people to know that the “40-
kilometer” security area was a lie.
The war was fought, in his view, to
establish a new order in Lebanon.

Zoref and his group do not feel
alone in opposing the war; 400,000
people demonstrated against the
operation. Even in the armed servi-
ces, where there is a ban on politi-
cal activity while on duty, there is
objection to the war, Zoref said.

The war will have an impact on

, ‘I.
OA«wl>lI<O1w_a§IrkrI .

Israeli society. “People are afraid,"
he told me. “They’re afraid of the
same thing that happened after
1967. They're afraid of
occupation.”

He warned that Prime Minister
Begin and Defense Minister Ariel
Sharon want to settle southern
Lebanon and possibly annex it.

Zoref said that he holds Begin,
Sharon and the IDF responible for
the massacre of Palestinians in the
refugee camps of Sabra and
Chatilla.

“They gave the orders and were
present when the Phalange went
in,” he said. “They are directly
responsible for the atrocities com-
mitted there.”

Zoref told me that he does not
expect the IDF to pull out for some
time. The question is now what
will become of the Begin govern-
ment. In Zoref’s opinion, Begin
and Sharon treat the Palestinians
like animals. Zoref believes there
can be no solution to “the Palesti-
nian problem," no justice without
self-determination for the Palesti-
nian people.

“The majority of the people are
tired of war,” Zoref said. “They just
want to live in peace."

Calls, Decisions; Pitt

Loses Tough One

5

By BRIAN BALK

Foge Fazio’s heart sank to per-
haps its lowest depths after Penn
State’s Nick Gancitano’s field goal
put the Lions ahead 19-10. Pitt
players shook their heads in dis-
gust knowing that the game, not to
mention the entire season, was lost.

Pitt’s pre-seasoii No. 1 ranking
faded to fiction as its opponents
from Happy Valley showed an
unyielding desire to capture their
first national championship.

Were the Panthers actually
outplayed—or were they out-
coached? Was it the questionable
officiating—or was it Mother
Nature that caused the Panther
downfall. Many unanswered ques-
tions will be rehashed for the next
year. Most will remain unans-
wered. All that will be fact is the
final score, 19-10 Penn State.

H The most obvious party to scru-

> tinize is the neutral party—the offi-

cials. Fazio did not make excuses or
place blame on anyone in particu-
lar, however, the opportunity
surely did present itself.

The first one came when a Keith
Williams 53-yard punt return was
called back. Additionally, Pitt "was
slammed with a delay of game
penalty. According to the officials,
Williams made an “invalid signal”
which froze the defense. According

 

to Williams, he just waved off the
other deep man, Chris ]elic.

"‘I questioned why he made the
call," Williams said afterward. “I
thought a fair catch was when
you're waving your hands over
your head.”

Fazio sided with Williams’ ques-
tioning the call. “I don’t think the
refs made the right call. In a punt
return, you have to make a definite
signal above your head—not waist
high,” Fazio said.

“I don’t know if that call cost us
the game, but itdefinitely hurt us,”
Williams added.

Another controversial call was
made when defensive end Al Weng-
likowski spun Lion tailback Kurt
Warner around, jarred the ball
loose and recovered the fumble.
The officials saw the play in a dif-
ferent light, ruling the ball dead on
the tackle.

Did Fazio call the w-rong plays at
times? It would seem so, but he had
his reasons. Late in the third quar-
ter, Pitt was buried deep in Penn
State territory. On a third-and-10
situation, Fazio elected to punt the
ball. ‘

“We couldn’t afford to have
another high snap,” Fazio
explained. “This way, if it hap-
pened again, we would get another
chance to punt again.”

With the swirling winds playing
havoc on Dan Marino’s spirals, 3

Bryan Thomas (44) slips

halfback’s efforts want In vain as Pitt lost to the Nittany Lions.

pass play was a precarious chance.
Thus, Fazio decided to punt on
third down with a 10 man rush,
rather than risk it on fourth with
an all-out rush.

There were other plays, however,
where Fazio’s decisions could be
questioned. After a personal foul
by Penn State’s Mark Robinson on
Panther flanker Dwight Collins
put the ball on the Lion 1-yard
line, Fazio called on Eric Schubert
for a field goal, rather than relying
on the power ofgthe offensive unit
to drive the ball into_the endzone

Lady Panthers Remain Undefeated

By SCOTT DE LLETT

The Pitt Lady Panther basket-
ball team ran its record to 3-0 Satur-
day when it routed National
College of Illinois 93-39 at the Fitz-
gerald Field House.

Sophomore forward Jennifer

Bruce led the Lady Panthers‘ scor- .

ing attack with 18 points while

ward Pam Miklasevich added 14

points and nine rebounds as Pitt
took a 47-15 halftime lead.

Freshman guard Kim Gannis
scored 12 points in just 13 minutes
of action while freshman Kim
Tirik had a gaine-high seven
assists.

The statistics showed the domi-
nation the Lady Panthers had over
National. Pitt shot 51 percent from
the floor while National shot 25

rebounded National by a two-to-

assists and 20 steals.

Forward Anti Logan was the
only National player in double fig-
ures with I2 points. She also had
five rebounds as National’s record
dropped to 0-2.

Fazio said he was confused.
“Everyone kept telling me that it
was first down,” he said. “But
when I looked up, it was fourth
down.” He added, “IfI had to do it
again, I probably would have gone
for the touchdown.”

With time running out, the
Panthers drove the -ball down to the
Penn State 30-yard line. Pitt trailed
by six and was faced with a fourth-
and-five situation. Fazio once
again called upon the kicking of
Schubert. He explained his ratio-
nale for making this decision.
“With four minutes to go, I

past Penn State linebacker Dave Paffenroth. The senior

thought V that if we could hold
them, we could come down and do
something again.” That, however,
never happened.

At the beginning of the third
quarter, heavy winds blew into
Nittany Valley. It was as if Paterno
clapped his hands, producing the
,inclimate football weather.

The harsh winds, hitting Pitt in
the face during the third quarter,
were a noticeable factor in the
game. Cornerback Tim Lewis
explained, “Every time the punts
went into the air, they would just
hang there and stop.”

Fazio Rates High
In First Collision A

With ‘God’

By BARRY ZASLOFF

While Penn State had Pitt firmly
secured in its claws late in the
fourth quarter, a reporter seated in
the press box offered: “They're
gonna hang Fazio back in
Pittsburgh.”

While the lynch mob hasn't yet
closed Fazio’s windpipe, it has fas-
tened the rope. The local sports
talk shows have been flooded with
callers criticizing some of Fazio’s
coaching decisions.

Fazio, in his first year as Pitt’s
coach, had the unenviable task of
matching wits with a god of sorts—
_]oe Paterno—last Friday at Happy
Valley. On a cold, blustery after-
noon, Pitt lost 19-10, which was no
disgrace considering that Penn
State may soon emerge from the
Sugar Bowl as national
champions.

It was Fazio, who has been the
subject of considerable criticism all
year long—even while his team
was undefeated, who faced the
game’s most difficult decisions.

Pitt was defeated. Once again,
Fazio was in the wrong place at the
wrong time.

The man who inherited a team
of which so much was expected, of
which anything short of a national
championship would be consi-
dered failure, has had the burden of
coaching in a Catch-22 situation.

If Pitt wins by a few points, it’s
not enough. If Pitt crushes a weak
opponent, it's taken for granted.
And if Pitt loses, as it did Friday,
the blame is heaped upon Fazio.

This one removed all possible
shelter for Fazio. Decisions. Lord,
the decisions. If the Panthers had
won, they would've passed with the
winds sailing across State College.
They lost, and the lynch mob is

Pa terno

Actually, a close look at Fazio’s
decisions indicate that he didcmore
than an adequate job of coaching.

0 With Penn State leading 16-7

and seven minutes left in the game,

Pitt faced a fourth-and-one situa-
tion from the Lion one. Fazio
opted to kick the field goal rather
than go for the touchdown.

“I question myself whether we
should have gone for the touch-
down,” he said shortly afterwards,
“but I had the strong feeling_that
we ‘could get the ball and score
again.”

“If I had to do it all over again,”
Fazio added, *“I probably would
have called time out and talked it
over.”

Still, the decision was not neces-
sarily a poor one. If Pitt had gone
for the TD and had been
unsuccessful—as it was on the pre-
vious two plays——the game would
have no longer been in doubt. By
kicking the field goal, Pitt moved
to a position where one score could
have won the game for them. There
was plenty of time left to march
down the field for a game winning
touchdown.

0 On Pitt’s next series, with the
Panthers trailing by six points,
Fazio called on Eric Schubert to
attempt a 47-yard field goal. This
was perhaps Fazio’s only mistake
of the day.

Schubert missed, but even if he
had been successful, Pitt would
have still trailed by three points. A
touchdown would still be needed
to win the game. By then there was
less than five minutes remaining. A
FG in that situation was meaning-
less, so why not play for the TD or,
at least, the first down?

It was, perhaps, Fazio’s only bad
decision ofthe afternoon. Which

“Tom. Darling put Pitt gymnastics
on the national map.”

Warren Neiger
By NORM VARGO

Tom Darling is one guy who
isn't afraid to admit he was a Pitt
gymnast who was in the right place
at the right time.

“Yes, I was fortunate to come
into a brand new era of gymnastics
when I arrived at Pitt," says
Darling—Pitt’s only NCAA cham-
pion and All-American in the 30-
year-old history of the sport at the
Oakland campus. “Every
nationally-recognized gymnast of
the time had graduated. Every-
thing was there for me to reach my
potential. I was comfortable with
the situation. Certainly, you can
say I took advantage of it.”

Darling——now an executive for
Nissen—Universal Corp. based in
Annapolis, Md.,——says he’s “sur-
prised" that he remains the Pan-
thers’ only gymnastics All-
American, three-times, in fact, and
Pitt’s only NCAA champion after
graduating more than a decade
ago.

“Like I said, I was fortunate in
that I came into a new program at
Pitt with experience,” recalls
Darling. “Down through the years
I thought Pitt would claim other

Panthers

champions. Some people came
extremely close. but missed out for
one reason or another."

Darling singled out some Pitt
gymnasts whom he figures
could‘ve notched national individ-
ual titles. Gymnasts like Dave
Hirst, who remains a long-time
friend after being a classmate and
teammate both at Pitt and before
that at Lincoln High School in
Northeast Philadelphia, and Jim
Mulvihill, Earl McConnell,
Lowell Meek and Ed Zamecnik.

“You could add Dave Shideman—
tle to that list, too,” added Darling.
“I’ve probably forgotten some oth-
ers. Gosh, it’s been so long since
I've discussed Pitt gymnastics with
people. It‘s hard to recall faces and
names of the good ones.”

Darling feels Hirst—who fin-
ished as the runnerup to Darling
on the rings in 1957—should’ve
been a national champion.
“Undoubtedly, Dave Hirst
should’ve been a champion. He
probably would’ve, too, but for
injuries,” reasoned Darling.

And Darling remembers Lowell
Meek as probably the Panther gym-
nast who wanted a national title
the most.

“Lowell wanted a title as much
as anybody. Certainly, he has to go
down as one of the ‘hungriest’
gymnasts ever to attend Pitt.
Lowell, too, could’ve been a
national champ had it not been for
problems.”

Darling
“problems.”

“Yes, we had problems in those
early years when Pitt was trying to
get its gymnastics program going,”
said Darling. “There was little

publicity in the sport unless you
competed for a big school like, say,
Penn State.

“We used to kid around that
Penn State gymnasts always
seemed to get extra points from the
judges. They didn't have the

back then as they do now.

“One reason I was able to win

Run Past Westminster In Second Half  

George Allen (11) was one of tour Panthers in double figures
as Pitt deleated Westminster, 80-67 at the Fitzgerald Field

House Saturday.

' ' Seezox photo

BY 5_COTT DELLETT
And TODD ERKEL

In past years, the Pitt Panther
basketball team experienced prob-
lems with less talented teams. For
example, the Panthers were only
able to defeat Davis and Elkins, a
Division III school, by two points.
And several years back, Morris
Hzirvey, a small college in West
Virginia, beat the Panthers by two
points.

For most of the first half, Pitt had
problems with Westminster, the
National Association of Intercolle-
giate Athletics (NAIA) District 18
champions in 1981-82. The Titans
kept the game close and even had a
slight two point lead. But the
Panthers recovered from the slug-
gish first half and came up with a
decisive 80-67 victory in the season
opener in front of a Fitzgerald Field
House crowd of 3,261 Saturday
night.

The score was tied 32-32 with
4:12 left in the first halfafter a pair
of foul shots by Westminster guard
Kevin Haynes. The Titans could
manage only one more point in the
half as an Andre Williams 15-foot
jumper, two foul shots by Clyde
Vaughan and a 20-foot jumper by
Billy Culbertson, after a steal by
Vaughan, with four seconds
remaining gave the Panthers a 38-
33 lead.

“The key to the game was the
end of the first half,” coach Roy
Chipman said. “We went from a
one to a five point lead, and we left
with momentum that carried over
to the second half."

The combination of Westmins-
ter’s style of play and overconfi-
dence led to the lackluster play in
the first half.

“Westminster played good,
smart basketball,” Chipman said.
“They were able to control the
tempo of the game in the first
half."

“We were overconf-ident in the
first half, and by the start of the

second half, we realized we had to
play.”

Vaughan, who led Pitt with 28
points and 12 rebounds, agreed
with Chipman about the team’s
overlooking Westminster.

“I think we learned tonight that
we can’t expect teams to give us the
game,” he said. “I think we went
out there expecting that tonight.”

The second half proved to be a
different story for the Panthers.
Using a 1-3-1 press, Pitt used its
advantage in height and quickness
against Westminster en route to a
54-37 lead.

“We had to pick up the tempo,
and it paid off for us,” Chipman
said. “The 1-3-1 threw off their
rhythm.”

The Panthers were able to keep
the lead in the teens until the latter
part of the game. Westminster con-
verted on three pairs of foul shots
and layups by Craig Randall, who
had 15 points, and Rob Killmer to
cut the lead to eight with 2:38
remaining. But Vaughan iced the
game for the Panthers with a foul
shot and a layup.

“For us, it was a good opener,”
Chipman said. “Westminster is a
well-coached team, and wehad to
make adjustments."

The game exposed two facets on
which the Panthers must work
before they‘ enter the balk of the
season. .

“We have to work harder on
defense,” Chipman said, “and our
ability to get the loose ball, but
people are looking at each other
and are too concerned with the fast
break.”

The Panthers had problems get-
ting the ball inside, but that was
due to Westminster’s giving Pitt
the medium-range shot.

“They were packing it in and,
with the exception of Clyde, they
were making our kids shoot.”

And the Panthers responded well
as Williams who had 16 points,
Culbertson, who finished with 12,
and guard George Allen, who came

off the bench to score 10, hit from
outside.

Chipman wants to establish
Charles Thompson at the big
guard shot, but so far, he has been
tight.

“Charles is still nervous and not
as loose as I’d like to see him,”
Chipman said. “We need to get a
big guard ready to play. Having
George and Billy in the game lim-
its us in some ways, especially def-
ensively. We can use George and
Billy against teams with small
guards, but we can’t afford to do it
going into the Big East schedule.”

The Panthers should face big
guards tommorrow night, as they
travel to the Civic Arena to face
crosstown rival Duquesne. The
Dukes will start Terry Teachout,
6-1, and Andy Sissini, 6-2. Neither,
however, is the big guard Chipman
fears.

Joey Myers is the lone returning
starter. The 6-8 senior forward
averaged 8.4 points and 6.7
rebounds per game in 1981-82.
Teachout, Sissini and Pat Farrell
provide ‘the main strength, 8

With the lack of talent, Chipman
expects a slowdown from
Duquesne.

“_I think Duquesne will try to
slow the tempo down,” he said. “I
think their refusal to play with the
clock shows this.”

Another aspect that has taken
away the luster of this rivalry is the
time at which the game is being
played—late November, instead of
January or February.

“I, personally, think it’s too
early to play this game,” Chipman
said. “I’m not into the game as
much, and the media certainly-isn’t
into it like years past."

Still, the game has
meaning.

“I think it’s an even bigger
rivalry now that we represent the
Big East, the best league in the
country right now,” Culbertson
said. “Besides, it's still Pitt versus
Duquesne.”

sented Pitt. It wasn't fair, but in
some cases gymnastic titles were
judged by personality and such,
instead of by effort. . . ‘

“But that’s changed, just as gym-
nastics has changed. I can see it
happening.

work at Michigan State. Atfer that,
I was an assistant coach at the

I coached teams that competed

By TIM DINGER

Although the talent gap between
the Pitt and Waynesburg wrestling
teams is significant, the Panthers
aren’t overlooking this opponent
in tomorrow’s match.

"‘It’s like the Pitt fooball team
playing Louisville,” assistant
wrestling coach Chuck Coryea
said. “We don’t want to key up too
much for them, but we also don’t
want to look past them.”

Despite an injury-plagued pre-
season, Coryea is optimistic about
the season opener.

“We’ve had a lot of injuries that
hurt us, but I think thatwe have the
depth now to handle them,” he
said.

Although theilineup is not com-
plete, the coaches have a general
idea who will wrestle at
Waynesburg.

At 118 lbs., either freshman Kyle
Nellis or junior Eric Lobell will
take the mats for Pitt. Nellis is a
high school All—America who won
four matches in last week’s Ohio
Open, his first collegiate conpeti—

j tion; Lobell is coming off of a red

and also internal problems that
had cropped up."

Darling feels that these "internal
problems" nearly ruined Pitt's
gymnastic program. “It didn’t help
matters any," he declared.

Ironically, Darling credits
Donna DeMarino Sanft—Pitt
women's gymnastic coach——for
sort of saying the boys’ program.
“Credit must go to Donna for keep-
ing up the continuity when the
internal problems threatened the
boys’ gymnastic program,” he sug-
gested. Without her effort, it’s hard

shirt last year because of knee
surgery.

At 126 lbs., the likely starter is
sophomore letterman Rich Ess-
wein; at 134 lbs., junior lettertnan
Joe Throckmorton will open.

At 142 lbs., itwill be either senior
John. Settineri or junior Craig
Richey and at 150, freshman Joe
Bond will get his first action as a
Panther. .

Pitt has a couple of Eastern
Wrestling League Champions in
the next two weight classes, sopho-
more Doug Haines at 158 lbs. and
junior Jeff _]elic at 167.

Curt Hertz starts his first year of
eligibility for the Panthers at the
I77 lb. weight class, and senior
Kurt Karanovich comes back after a
redshirt year at 190 lbs. _

The heavyweight position is still
undecided; either senior Paul Sal-
oky or j unior Dan Kasperkoski will
claim the spot.

Although Waynesburg is an
NAIA (National Association of
Intercollegiate Athletics) school,
Coryea is not sure of his position.

It wasn’t a question of having

_The Pitt News, Monday November 29, I982

AMERICANS, ISRAEL, AND PEACE

THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES AND ISRAEL SHARE COMMON IDEALS, VALUES, AND SPIRITUAL
ROOTS. BOTH GOVERNMENTS ARE COMMITTED TO DEMOCRACY, JUSTICE, HUMAN R|GHTS.AND FREE-
DOMS. WE AFFIRM OUR UNYIELDING SUPPORT FOR THE STATE OF ISRAEL AND RECOGNIZE ITS RIGHT TO
LIVE WI-THIN SECURE AND RECOGNIZED BOUNDARIES FREE FROM THREAT OR ACT OF FORCE. WE FEEL
THAT IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE CONGRESS AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO CONTINUE THE BI-PARTISAN
POLICIES WHICH ENHANCE THE ECONOMIC STABILITY AND THE MILITARY SECURITY OF THE STATE OF
ISRAEL. THESE POLICIES ARE CLEARLY BENEFICIAL TO BOTH AMERICANS AND ISRAELIS.

IN LIGHT OF THIS CONSENSUS, WE COMMEMORATE THE NOVEMBER 29,1947 UNITED NATIONS RESOLU-
TION WHICH RESULTED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE JEWISH STATE. WE REGRET THE CONTINUED
STATE OF WAR THAT HAS ENVELOPED THE NATIONS OF THE MIDDLE EAST FOR MORE THAN THREE
DECADES. WE CALL ON ISRAEL’S NEIGHBORS TO END THEIR CONTINUED REJECTION AND INVITE THEM TO
JOIN ALL PEACE-LOVING PEOPLE IN AN EFFORT TO MAKE THE DREAM OF PEACE A REALITY.

UNQUESTIONABLY THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE HAVE INALIENABLE RIGHTS AND WE SUPPORT NEGOTIA-
TIONS WITH PALESTINIAN REPRESENTATIVES WHO OPENLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE LEGITIMACY OF THE
STATE OF ISRAEL. WE FEEL THAT THIS CONDITION IS THE ESSENTIAL PREREQUISITE TO SINCERE NEGOTI-
ATIONS DESIGNED TO GUARANTEE PALESTINIAN RIGHTS WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY SECURING ISRAELI

BORDERS.

A GENUINE PEACE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HER NEIGHBORS MUST ENCOMPASS FULL DIPLOMATIC

V RELATIONS, THE END OF HOSTILE PROPAGANDA, AND THE TERMINATION OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC
WARFARE. THESE OBJECTIVES CAN ONLY BE ATTAINED THROUGH MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING AND

RESPECT BY ALL PEOPLES WHO LIVE IN THIS TROUBLED REGION. WHEN THESE GOALS ARE REALIZED,

ISRAEL AND HER NEIGHBORS WILL LIVE IN PEACE AND TRANQUILITY.

“PAID FOR BY CONCERNED
STUDENTS, B’NA| BRITH HILLEL”

Nationality Rooms Get Dressed Up For Christmass,

‘Tis the season for holiday
decorating-and Pitt’s
Nationality Rooms are no
exception.

The 18 classrooms, which
were given as gifts to the
University from the ethnic
groups in Allegheny
County, are used daily for
teaching in the arts and
sciences.

During the month of
December, the rooms are

decorated in authentic
Christmas styles, with most
of the ornamental objects
made by hand in the tradi-
tional fashion.
The decorating, which beg-
ins this year on Saturday,
December 4, is done by the
various committees which
maintain their particular
classroom.

Guided tours of the rooms
are usually available Mon-

day through Friday from 9
a.m. to 5 p.m. and Saturday
and Sunday, from 12:30 to 4
p.m. Reservations are requi-
red, and nominal fees are
requested from April
through August and during
December when student
volunteers are not on
campus.

Members of Quo Vadis, the
organization of student
volunteer guides for the

 
   
 
   
 
  
  
  
 
  
  
 

  
  

rooms are trained in the his-
tory of the rooms and in the
cultures of the countries they
represent. Members inter-
pret for visitors the concept
symbolized in the rooms,
while sharing the excite-
ment of helping others dis-
cover therichness of the
ethnic backgrounds por-
trayed.

There is also a Visitors
Center located in the Com-
mons Rooms, open week-
days, which offers a slide
presentation of the rooms,
and information. The
Nationality Rooms gift cen-
ter, located nearby, carries

Your education doesn't stop with a baccalaureate degree. It begins
there. Once you enter the world of work, you will gain valuable ex-
p( rience and really discover what it's all about to use what you learned

in college.

Take the Air Force for example. As a commissioned officer you'll be

' handed executive responsibility on your very first assignment. You'll

manage people and complex systems. You'll be expected to perform
well, and you'll be paid well, too. lt’ s worth working for.

You can get there through the Air Force ROTC program. In fact, we
have (1 scholarship plan that will net you $100 a month tax free and
pay l- »r all tuition, l)O()l(S and lab and incidental fees. And that will free
you to concentrate on your studies so you can get well prepared for

where you're headed.

Check It out. Find out how you can get into a “graduate” program
like the Air Forr:e. It's a great way to serve your country, and possibly
find your formal education extended at Air Force expense as well.

‘‘Indian food is only as
spicy as you are.” es

Mike Kalina - Pittsburgh’s
famous dining critic.
Indian food is the most

misunderstood cuisine in

Pittsburgh. The general
misconception is that it is
very spicy and hot but that is
not me case. We at TAJ
Restaurant have a degree of
spicyness on a scale of 1 to
10. . . 1 being mild enough

a challenge to the brave!

Everything in life should be
tried if possible before
passing judgement and
Indian food deserves that
chance. We have converted
a lot of die hards to our food
why don’t you try it?
Consider it an experiment in
international dining and find
out if nothing else, how a
country with a population of
700 million eats.
