WPGH Called.
‘Step Forward’

In Radio Talk

Chancellor Litchﬁeld recogniz-
ed the University’s new radio sta-
tion, WPGH, this week as being
“a major step forward in
promoting better _ communication
between the students, faculty, and
administration.”

At a meeting in his office Mon-
day, the Chancellor officially

‘ acknowledged the establishment

T

 

of the student broadcasting set-
up. He commented on the work
initiated chiefly by Richard Rauh,
general manager of the station,
David Mishelevich, assistant gen-
eral manager and Nathan Fire-
stone, program director recorded
in a conference which was later
broadcast.

At the beginning of the discus--.

sion, which was arranged with the
co-operation of Bernard Adams,
special assistant to the Chancellor,
Litchﬁeld expressed his hopes for
the growth and success of the
radio station.
Facilities to Expand

Possibilities of expanding the
range and facilities of the organi-
zation were discussed which, ac-
cording. to Mishelevich, were
“most encouraging to the staff of
the radio station.”

The Chancellor also indicated
a desire for the highest quality
campus broadcasting, which he
felt would be a ﬂexible means
of faculty-student-administrah
tion communication.

In the part of the meeting
which was broadcast, Litchﬁeld
congratulated -.\,g‘.he_, students re-
sponsible for‘  realization of
WPGH, and spoke highly of their
“many years of service‘? to the
idea of campus radio. .. ‘ '

upon the “unusual significance of
student broadcasting.” After enu-
merating the ’many groups on

 Wcampus who have a needifor bet-

,23 ter‘ communication with their as-

sociates‘, the-Chancellor stated that
he was “constantly looking 3701‘
new devices for expressing my
views on current campus develop-
ments to the students anc‘ facul-

Hc added that the radio sta -
tion may possibly be a method
for the much—needed improve-
ment in faculty-student-admin-
istration relationships.

Another service which the
Chancellor feels the station can
perform is in interpretation of
news. He described it as a “new
way to bring intellectual life to
the students.”

of student leaders some time be-
fore the increase was approved
by the Board of Trustees, and al-

they‘ saw that the increase was
entirely‘ justified. .

“In the University’s attempt to
increase’ the quality of its educa-
tional program, the cost of main-
taining and ‘expanding the Uni-
versity facilities have naturally
increased.

“The University budget,”
continued Rankin, “amounts
each year to approximately 35
million dollars. Of this amount,
814; or 9 million dollars is de-
rived from tuition and student
fees, however, instructional and
related educational costs are
almost 13 million, a substantial-
ly larger amount than the rev-
enue from tuition.

“This deficiency must. therefore,
be made up from other sources.
In the past 13 years, continued
Rankin, “book prices have in-
creased 46 per cent, faculty sal-
aries 35 per cent, and journal
prices 82 per cent.

“The main point to be gained
from these ﬁgures is that tuition
costs don't begin to 933’ for the

tional program.” '

Slotkin, Sobota Present Proposals

Senate Considers Reorganization

By JOSIE GROSSIVIAN

SG considered two possible
plans for student government re-
organization Monday at what Jay
Fingeret called “the most impor-
tant meeting of the year.” Sena-
tor Ray Reeves submitted one
alternative in cooperation with
Bob‘ Slotkin, and SG president
Richard Sobota presented the
other. ‘

Both measures were tabled un-
til the next SG meeting Monday.

Reeves’ proposal called for five
changes in the present constitu-
tion. First of all, representation
would be determined on the basis
of schools -— two senators for
each 500 students in Liberal Arts,
Education, Engineering and Mines,

Business Administration, Pharm-
acy, and Nursing. Accuracy of ap-
pointment would be checked pri-
or to registration.
Includes Councils

In addition, the president of
Men's Council, AWS, IFC, Pan-
Hellenic Council, Men’s Dorm
Council, and Student Union Board
would be senate members.

The next three points con-
cerned the office of president:
he would be required to attend
all senate meetings but would
have no vote; he may be a
member of but may hold no of-
{ice or responsibility in any
other campus organization; and
he will receive threelacademic
credits for his position from the

Chancellor

Releases V iew
On Penalties

Litchﬁeld recently
released a public statement con-
cerning his stand on the much
talked—about disciplinary action
which resulted in the suspension
of several top Universityathletes.

The Chancellor, who had been
out of town when the penalties
were made public, commented in
‘this manner: ‘

Chancellor

“These are private matters be-
tween the individuals
and the University, and therefore
not something about which the
University is permitted to com-
ment publicly.

Should Proﬁt

“If the students can proﬁt from
their mistakes, there is every rea-
son to expect that the entire mat-
ter will be settled and forgotten
before the opening of another
school year.

“For the sake of the students
involved and their families, we
hope this can be done without
the further penalty of addition-
al public account.”

The football varsity men who
have been suspended are Bob
Ostrosky, Paul Martha, John
Botula, Glenn Lehner, Carmen
Ronca and Ray Conway.

This is the second time in three
years that football players have
been suspended or dismissed from
school for disciplinary’ reasons.

They will be allowed to re-
enter_school in the fall trimester.

He will work closely with a su- ,
pervising professor in this de-
partment and receive his grade
from him. «
Rccves feels that the three
credits will provide incentive for
the president as well as make him
a more responsible executive be-
cause of the faculty advising.
“We have been Satisfied with
weak leadership," Reeves said,
“We need executive direction."
The choice of senators from the
schools, he stated, will stabilize
the base of representation.
Reeves’ proposal was tabled
until the other plans could be
considered. Sobota’s motion. oili-

‘Tone Bad in Sonic Locations’

WPGH Meets With Apathy;
Encouragement, And Static

By MARILYN EIGES

The first broadcast of stations
WPGH through the Schenley
quadrangle Monday night met
with adversity in the form of stu-
dent apathy and much interfer-
ence from static.

A door-to-door survey of lis-
teners made in McCormick Hall
dormitory found listeners in two
of the thirty suites polled. When
questioned about the program,
many students replied they had
attempted to tune in the broadcast
but had been ‘unable to locate it.

The only sound emanating from
650 on the dial was static —- loud
and clear. This tended to dampen
the interest of listeners who aban-
doned further attempts.

Girl’s Stare

Some girls were unaware of
the new addition to the dial;
others greeted the questing in-
truder with a baleful stare.

However, where electronic re-
ception was good, so was lis-
tener reception. Judy Gold, arts
‘64: “I think it is a ﬁne under-
taking and could be the basis
for more unity on campus.”

Greatest response from the male
side of campus came from the
9th floor of Holland Hall where,
according to Stanley Knoll, arts
‘65, “Everybody on the ﬂoor has
tried to get WPGH with no suc-

Tone Suffers

Reaction differed little on other
ﬂoors. Philip Jaffe: “I don’t think
it could make a hit during the
week when people are studying,
but perhaps weekends would ﬁnd
more listeners.”

David Carson, eng. ‘65: “I
tried but couldn’t receive the

' show because of interference.
However, if the reception was
better I would certainly listen.”
The Student Union was equip-
ped with a loudspeaker which
broadcast the show during its
ﬁve hours on the air. Reception
there was clearer than at any
other point on campus but the
tone was still not entirely clear.
Deskman Ignores
Assorted bystanders in the Un-
ion felt the broadcast a goodthing
when it was called to their atten-
tion but hadnot previously real-
ized the show was on. When ask-
ed if he had been listening to the
broadcast, the SU night desk man,
who was standing in front of the
speaker, replied “No” and return-
ed to his work.

Up in the broadcasting sta-
tion, the staff was hopeful about
their reception and looked for-
ward to elimination of all static
and technical interference.

 
 
 

Amateur ‘Radio

  

Club Begins

Operation of 1000-wt. Station

The University Amateur Radio
Association has begun operating
a thousand-watt short - wave
transmitter.

The transmitter, lent to the
University by Bob Staib, a ham
operator from Ohio, is as power-
ful as any other amateur station
in the country. Its power is equal

{to that of WLOA and WYRE

(formerly WEEP). K3RIA, the
University’s ham station, is 81
times as powerful as WPGH, the
University‘s closed circuit broad-

casting station.

Formerly, using iow power,
the ham station has contacted
49 states and ﬁve continents."
The ham club has maintained.
phone patch service for stu-
dents who are more than 500
miles from home.

Students desiring phone patches
to points over 500 miles from
Pittsburgh can register’ with the
radio club by calling Extension
7379 or applying at KZRIA, 326
Schenley Hall.

University Theater Casting

Planned For ‘Becket’ Play

Readings will begin soon for the upcoming University
Theater presentation of Jean Anoui1h’s “Becket,” a drama
of conﬂicting friendship and religion between a reigning
French monarch and his closest companion in work and
pleasure. '

Bernard Engel will direct the production and Philip Eek
will design the medieval settings . P
and costumes. Engel has appeared '
in several Broadway shows and
more recently directed’ “The
Deadly Game” at the Pittsburgh
Playhouse.

Preliminary plans call C for
“Becket” to be ‘staged A in. the
Commons Room in a “theater-in-
the-round” atmosphere. Demands
of the play require the Gothic set-
ting of the Cathedral to empha-
size the color and pagentry of the
story and also to accommodate
the script’s requirements for ﬁve
horses. ' I 

All members of the, Univer-
sity community are eligible for
casting of the 40 available parts.
Because of the number of roles
and the construction of the play,
rehearsal calls will not be more
than one or two nights weekly
for most characters.

Included in the cast of char-
acters are ‘an English knight, the
King of France and his courtiers,

  Graduate A ssis tame

While the increased monies gained from the recent

tuition hike may put Pitt in a better bargaining position

as far as a better quality faculty membership is concerned,
they cannot eliminate a basic teaching problem —- the
graduate student assistant. ~

A Taken from the undergraduate student’s viewpoint, it

‘ is difficult to justify a higher price for education when

there is a strong possibility that he will obtain the same
quality of teaching he is now receiving from a number
of graduate’ student. assistants. According to Dr. Alan C.
Rankin, assistant chancellor of Student Affairs, “Due to

' the nature of courses in which graduate student assistafits

are employed, it is possible that a freshmanlor sophomore
can receive/a signiﬁcant portion of his totalclassroom hours

a‘

‘But, on the other hand, where- else can the future col-

V lege teachers and professors receive their training than in ‘I
 thelactual classroom situation on the University level?

Although, these are only two aspects of the problem, the
ability. to co-ordinate these conﬂicting views remains in
the hands of_University ofﬁcials. And as far as it has gone,
Pitt has found a workable solution whereby both graduates

 and undergraduates can beneﬁt.

In the past three years the number of graduatevstudent
ass-istantshas decreased by 40 percent. In 1959 there were
271 graduate student assistants; today there are 163. The
lone fact that the University has cut back on the number of
graduate assistants now employed on campus indicates a

realization of‘ the problems involved in extensive use of i

such assistants. It also gives the University more oppor-
tunity to be selective in theiquality of students it needs
for teachers. _,

In the second place, as the system now stands, gradu-
ate student assistants are generally selected as section
leaders in conjunction with lectures given by a senior fac-
ulty member. In addition, the graduate assistant is super-
vised and given training seminars along with his teaching
assignments. Therefore, in an area where he was once
sadly lacking, the graduate student now has some back-
ground of teaching techniques to supplement his individual
knowledge. I

But while the improvements listed above help alle-
viate: some of the problems on the graduate and undergradu-
ate level, one basic consideration has been overlooked.

When a person is hired for a teaching position, he should‘

know something about teaching- Quality faculty’ members
may be those most knowledgeable or outstanding in their
respectiveﬁelds, but quality teachers must also be able to
impart that knowledge in the most effective way. Before
they are put in a University classroom, graduate students
should not only be screened for their capabilities as scholars
but, if given’ ateaching assignment, more careful considera-
as well.

  

  

 

IA Salute to Solitude

The Last

By Bill Mawllinney

In a society which regards television, Holly-
wood, transistor radios, sweet breath, and weekly
clubimeetings as the highest achievements of man-
kind, it is not surprising to ﬁnd that few people
can comfortably entertain the
thought of being completely
alone.

To be alone, according to
Webster, is to be “apart from
others; all by *one’s self; solitary;
exclusive of others; without any-
one or anything’ else; only.”
Aloneness does not allow for a
radio or television, a telephone
or doorbell. Everyone could use
solitude, but few indulge them-
selves. It is ,a tonic in this
crowded world with its many jarring edges.

, Yet I, feel it is unfair to blame our lack of sol-
itude on theipressing demands and activities which
consume so much of our time. After all, we make
ourselves busy so we will not have to face being
alone. To be quietly and calmly alone, with no dis-
tractions, is a luxury to those who can- do it, and
a nightmare to those who cannot. Once the mind
starts to wander in its unusual way, exploring
unique, sometimes frieghtening paths, most people
will reach quickly for the television or telephone.
Transistor Trance

Consider, for example, those ..-who travelthe
streets with a transistor radio blaring from their
pocket, or—pressed against their ear. They have suc-

ceeded in escaping their thoughts completely. A.

glaze comes over their eyes, they stagger and
lurch through the crowds, anxious only to get home
and turn on their television sets. As long as some-
thingvis claiming their eyes or ears (preferably
both) they are content.

Salutes to solitude are found in all literatures

Franchise of the Future

 

and in all times. It has been an eternal fascination
to the Far Eastern philosophers, and has ﬁgured

‘importantly in the lives of the Christian saints. .

Our own literature stresses the man of action and
man in his society, but we can ﬁnd, occasionally,

’a rare jewel such as “Walden” by Henry David

Thoreau. After living for a year in the woods near

 Walden Pond in Massachusetts, Thoreau wrote, “I

love to be alone. I never found the companion

that was so campanionable as solitude. We are for .,

the most part more lonely when we go abroad

among men than when we stay in our chambers. ., ,
A man thinking or working is always alone, let 

him be where he will.” Thoreau’s book is not an
expression of misanthropy, but a celebration of
the individual and the rational in man.
Misanthropy Passe ,

Our society has little sympathy with the con-
templative man. The sense we give ‘to words be-

trays our opinion of him. “Hermit,” “recluse,” “out-

sider” and “stay-at—home” are all somewhat de-
rogatory, while “camaraderie,” “sociability,” “good
mixer” and “adaptability’ cary a stamp of ap-
proval. Misanthropy is rather out of fashion, and
a solitude is a near-forgotten pastime. Those who
prefer it are constantly being urged by their friends
to “join something.” Sociability is quite natural
to man, but how much sweeter it is when tempered

-and balanced by contemplation.

The last stronghold of the “loners” is any big
city like Pittsburgh. Only there is it possible to
experience that strange sensation of being “alone
in a crowd.” Solitude, after all, is not a question
of physical distance. It is simply a matter of with-
drawing into one’s self, and letting the mind work,
uninterrupted by the distractions of everyday life.
Most people," however, equate aloneness with.lone-
linessf Nothing could be more“ mistaken. Anyone
who can be alone and occupy himself ‘without the
use of “props” is in no, danger of being lonely.

Who Will Vote?

, By Barry Gross I
“ ‘The unlimited democracies were unstable be-
cause their citizens were not responsible for the
fashion in which they exerted their sovereign
authority . . . No attempt was made to determine

whether‘ a voter was socially re-

spon-sibleqto the extent ,_of‘ his
literally unlimited authority’.” I

This will be part of a lecture
delivered by aniO.C.S. instructor.
of the future. The instructor
will be talking about the nations
of the twentieth century. The
sentences quoted above are from’
“Starship Troopers” by Robert
A. Heinlein, a book which ex-
trapolates not only upon the type
of war to be fought in the future
by highly trained men in mechanized armor, but
also suggests a future where the voting franchise
is limited. V

In this future society, every voter and office-
holder has served a minimum of two- years in the
Federal Service as a member of the armed forces
or, if unﬁt for the complicated war/fare of the fu-
ture, as a government employee. Only upon com-
pleting a voluntary term’ of active service and
having been honorably discharged or placed on

inactive retired status can a person vote and hold .

office. i
Authorityv Equals Responsibility

By serving in the armed forces a person has
earned the right to vote by demonstrating “that he
places the welfare of the group ahead of personal
advantage.” He feels that “authority and responsi-
bility must be equal.” .. . I

The idea that not everyone who now qualiﬁes
by law to vote is actually capable of intelligently
exercising his responsibility is emotionally charged.
At ﬁrst it seems anti-American, a violation? of civil
rights. Immediately objections can. be raised. Ifthe‘
right to vote were to be limited more than it is
now, would it not be a step‘ backwards, erasing’

those gains which were made_ in civil rights when-
ithe voting franchise was extended to negroes and; 

then to women‘?
Soldier/Citizen A 

Nobody wants a child or a mentally incom-
petent person to vote. We doV_,h,ave certain restric-
tions today. And it may be that as the decisions af-

     

 

’ editing.

fecting our country and other countries become
more complicated to make and demand greater
considerations by both..voters -and officeholders, it

could become necessary to provide new. qualiﬁca-

tions. *

Heinlein suggests that there is a moral diﬁer-
ence between a citizen and a soldier which leaves
the man who has been a soldier more aware of the
responsibility of voting. “A. soldier accepts re-
sponsibility for the safety of the body politic of
which he is ‘a member, defending it, if need be,
with his life. The civilian does: not.” '

Today there are American ‘soldiers who have
accepted this responsibility for the safety of their
country. They man Polaris submarines or march
along the Berlin border. But many of them cannot
vote because they are under 21. , 
Responsigbility Behind Authority
 ‘At the same time, b-ack in the states, a 23 year
old pool hall loafer can forgetto vote or wait un-
til some crooked politician has slipped him ﬁve
dollars and vote as he is instructed. He doesn’t have
to bother considering which candidate could do
the job better.

The person who has undergone at least two
years of service before being allowed to vote,

would put some thought into his voting and this

resulting awareness of the responsibility behind
the voter’s authority might very-well improve a

democracy:

The idea submitted by Heinlein probably has
some ﬂaws, but it is worth some discussion. ,It
might be better to first read the book in order to
discuss the idea in its context instead of from the
few observations "made here, V

Daryl Too Heavy
For 137 lb. Class

Panther wrestling fans who

 are accustomed to seeing the
, familiar combination of Daryl
. Kelvington and John Zolikoﬁ
-in the 137, and 147 pound

divisions are in for a surprise

when the matmen take on Syra-
cuse at the Field House Saturday.

Zolikoff who has never wrestled’

lower than .147 pounds will drop
down to 137, while Kelvington
who is getting too heavy for 137
and has been rwrestling at 157
will be in Zolikoff’s old spot.
Zolikoff, who had his weight
down to 143 pounds last v.-‘ck,

i ,may have to get along on crackers
andwater this week to make the
1-new weight, but he is conﬁdent

that he will do it.
Strongest Team
The shifting of Zolikoff and
Kelvington will enable Coach Rex
Peery to ﬁeld his strongest team.
Augie Arrigone and Jim Harrison
will be able to drop down to
their regular classes, 157 and 167
pounds respectively. A g a i n s t

highest weight class.
Ken_Barr_will be inserted in
the 177 pound slot and Tom

Johnson Tops T ykes

By JIM O’BRIEN

The most bizarre cast of characters to hit the road since I’

Jack Kerouac and his buddies careened across the country,
hit. Pittsburgh this week. They call themselves. things like
Little Beaver, Fuzzy Cupid, Sky Low Low and Tiny Tim.

They are midget wrestlers in the fairy tale scheme of things. ;
Meanwhile, working diligently in a tropical room at the ‘

extreme end of the Field House,
a near dwarf who calls himself
simply Mike Johnson was sweat-
ing worse than Elsa Maxwell after
touching her toes.

Johnson is a legitimate wrestler,
but at 123 pounds «he could easily
qualify for the midget card at the
arena.

. Grabbed Titles

He’d probably win, too. “He's
the best high schoolwrestler that
I’ve ever seen,” Coach Rex Peery
claims. It’s no wonder. Now a Pitt
freshman, Johnson had a phe-
nomenal record of 84-0 in four
years of scholastic wrestling, in-
cluding four state titles. To make
the tale even more ﬁctional sound-
ing, he never had a take-down

S scored against ’ him.

Johnson doesn’t mind being
so small. “It takes all the fun

All-America Tabs

Socce-r’s Liherati

Soccer halfback Paul Liberati
has been named as a honorable
mention on the College All-
America Soccer team, it has been
announced recently.

Liberati, a junior from Spring-
dale, Pa., handled‘ the left half-
back spot for the booters and
wasinstrumental in their ﬁne de-
fensive showing. Coach Leo Bemis
feels that “Paul should be able‘
to make the ﬁrst team All- Amer-

out of the sport,” he said, “if
you don't work to get your
weight down.” Johnson can lose
lup to 15 pounds in ﬁve days
“ time. “It just takes a little sac-
riﬁce, that’s all.”

Johnson got beat this year —— a
teammate, Captain Dick Martin, a
senior on the varsity, turned the
trick, and it took him quite a
while to do it. Martin won the
match on riding time, i.e., con-
trolling his opponent on the mat
for a length of time.

“I-Ie’s fantastic on his feet,”
Martin claims. “He’s like 'a living
legend, and most of . the people
wanted him to beat me. I’ve met
better men on the mat, but none
lik_e he is when he’s on his feet.
He doesn’t act like he's so good
either.” - V

167 pounder Gary Sirota could
give the Panthers trouble.
Syracuse should provide a good
trial for the -new Panther lineup,
which7“.Peery hopes will spring-
board the grapplers to an out-
standing season. However, the

real test of the squad should come
a week from Saturday when the
matmen travel to Army to meet
a strong Cadet team.

Mike and Dave Johnson

“He isn’t cocky,’ Frosh Coach
Dave Johnson, says of his little
brother. “But when he goes out
there he is sure that he's going to
win. He felt that he’d beat /Martin.
We were worried about how he’d

take a loss, but he took it real

swell. _

think he’s just awfully good.-”

A BAskET AND A BALL

Dr. James Naismith tacked a peach basket on
the ledge of a gymnasium, pumped  a soccer
ball, and invented the pastime called basketball.
That’s about all Ernie McCoy, the athletic director
of Penn State, does for the Uni-
versity Park campus team, only
he gets a maintenance man to
climb the ladder.

And that’s about the farthest
State basketball gets off the
ground the rest of the season. It
enjoys a unique status on the
sprawling land agency. At most
other schools it is the. No. 1 in-
door winter sport, but at State it 3
plays patsy to wrestling, gym- 
nastics and the football team’s
bowl ventures.

 

‘The Lions had a near-version of Don Hennon

for four years in Mark DuMars, andonly his rela-
tives ever made an effort to see him in action. The
school has come up with respectable ﬁves in other
seasons (no fault of the athletic department) and
still the team put on private exhibitions.«

The man caught in the middle of this laissez-
faire attitude is husky John Egli, the amiable men-

Syracuse Gym
Squad Here
On Saturday

The Syracuse gymnastic ~

meo will attempt to capture

tory of the season when they
meet Pitt at the Field House
Saturday afternoon.

Team Captain for the Orange-
men Phil “Corky” Voas is ‘the
man to watch according to Pan-
ther Coach Warren Neiger, in the
first event of the day, floor exer-
cise, Voas will pit his skills
against Pitt’s Earl .McConnell.

“I anticipate a real battle be-
tween Voas and McConnell --

both are excellent tumblers,” re-
marked Coach Neiger, “but I think

that an individual can enter, cop-
ped ﬁrst place honors in floor ex-
ercise and longhorse and a second
place position on the horizontal
bars against Navy earlier this
season.

Syracuse Junior Ray Grim-aldi
is expected to give Roland James,
Pitt‘ sophomore, a hard time when
they meet on the side horse. Nei-
ger dubs Grimaldi “a smooth per-
formerf’, Orangeman Ronnie Or-
lick may ..also give the Blue and
Gold some- anxious moments. ‘Or-
lick is the leading scorer for Syra-
cuse this season.

In spite of Syracuse”s impres-
sive showing in their ﬁrst two
outings, Neiger, relying on out-
standing routines by veterans Mc-
Connell and Ed Zamecnik, is very
optimistic about the results of Sat-
urday’s meet.

Sports Editor

State does not have one boy on a full athletic
scholarship. The Fraternity Council on the campus
usually foots the bill hallway with the athletic de-
partment for each athlete, unless he is a Negro,
and then there are other problems.

John Mitchell, one of these Negroes, who hails
from Pittsburgh Central Catholic, doesn’t even have
a meal ticket. During the holidays the players were
almost left to scratch for themselves, with matters
of food and clothing more question marks.

Like. Pigs

“We were asked to bunk in the locker rooms,”

the young Lion remarked. “But Coach threatened
to send us all home if we had to live like pigs.”
It is normal for the school to allot three
dollars a day to a basketball player for a
“training meal” and for his amusement when
the team is on the road. At these rates he
could just about oat bran flakes for “training”
and crack peanut shells for “amusement” and
a little more nourishment.

Indifference toward the sport took an upturn

this campaign. Wayne Lundy, a 6-6 center of top-
notch capabilities, got in scholastic trouble with the
help of a “D”;in a physical educational class. He
could have been saved, but McCoy had to go
hunting. ‘ -

They lost Lundy. It would be like us losing,
well, it would be like Duquesne losing Willie
