The author of the following article, Steven C. Beering, is chair-
man of the Stude-nt_Congress Academic Promotions Committee. That
group has fostered the new, Council of Scholastic Organizations to

- promote high academic standards in Pitt organizations. In order to
‘accl-omplish its purpose of encouraging scholastic standings, CS0 is
only opensto organizations which can" show a: 2.0 overall QPA. His
article is a reply to groups and persons who have found him _“dis-
criminating” organizations which may join CSO. -
By STEVE BEERING ,

The other day I was squeezed into a localelevator on
the Ground Floor and momentarily a "burly, ruddy—f_aced
chap barked at me: “Do you‘ admit that you’re discriminat-
ing?” Noting my puzzled look, he hastened to add that he
was referring-to the standards we had set up for member-
ship in the new Council of Scho-6 .  '

Elastic Organiza-tions. Immedi.ate- ' P‘
1y _* I replied that we were, of
course, not discriminating.

Seeing my face ﬂush “with,
righteous’ indignation, the tall
blond fellow continued: “But you
are denying certain organizations
the right to join?” He regarded me .
.with obvious delight as I some-1
what peevishly rejoined that we
were indeed doing so. “Well, isn’t'
that discriminating?” he shot back I -
triumphantly. “No doubt abouti ‘ ‘
zit,” I said, “we are discriminating; 1 .
you’re right!” 3

Rally Pact;

Writes Own

Carnegie Tech Student
Congress has officially reject-
ed the “Rally Damage Pact”
that would place responsi-
bility for damage incurred at
rallies on the governing bodies
and individual- students of the
city schools.

In a letter to SC president Ross
Reese, read at Monday’s meeting,
the Tech council absolved itself
of paying any expenses. The mes-
sage read “that in instances of
visitation of other campuses the
ﬁnancial responsibility of any
damage done, insofar as Student

V Council can establish be borne by

individuals who are responsible
for such damage.” That is if, re-
sponsible students can be appre-
hended. -

‘ Ritz Hits Tech

Pat Ritz WSGA president, call-
ed down Tech’s decision andfelt
that its representatives to, the
original meeting, Oct. 1, had not
adequately explained the pact to
their student body. ‘‘It was made
general enough to be suited to all
campuses” Miss Ritz stated. All
representatives agreed upon it.
_T_ech people cond'ucted the meet-,

SC passed a recommendation
Monday. that Pitt senda letter to
the Carnegie‘ Tech Student Coun-
cil acknowledging receipt of their
let-ter and the decision that they
-.made; that it state Pitt’s group
would stand by the original state-
ment as a “matter of policy” ex-
pressing thehope‘ that inthe fu-
ture the neighboring school would
see its way to‘acceptin.g the pact
as originally detailed.
No Word From Duke

Still no word has been received
from the Student governing bod-
ies of Duquesne University nor

School spirit has long been maligned at Pitt 'due_to
poor turnouts at football games, pep rallies, social affairs,"

H...

Dr. Carlson believes that much of
the controversy surrounding the
“spiritless Pittites” is due to con-
fusion and ignorance concerning
the controversial term “school
spirit.”

In‘ an effort to pin down, in
concrete terms, the true meaning
of the two-word phrase, Dr.
Carlson presented his idea to The
Pitt News in order that it could
be thrown open to the entire Uni-
versity. _ "

“Too many people talk about
"Pitt not having any school spir-
it,” says the “Doc,” and they
don’t know what school spirit
1s.”

Dr. Carlson has been interested
in this idea for quite some time
and the trigger for his project
came when he saw the small num-
ber of students that showed up to
send the Panthers off to North-
western.‘ .

He broached his idea to the

Academics Committee
Lists Many Objectives

The Student Congress Academic Promotion committee
has completed a list of 18 goals and objectives to improve
academic standings at the University of Pittsburgh.

In a completed report passed unanimously by committee
members at a meeting Friday afternoon, the following pre-

amble was set down as the com-
mittee’s purpose: “to publicize,
recognize, and promote any organ-
izations, projects, curricula, tradi-
tions, program, ideas, speakers
and events that -in someway or
other exert a broadening cultural
inﬂuence, raise academic stand-
ards and contribute towards schol-
arship.”

Academic Standards Foremost

Chairman Steven C. Beering im-
pressed the point that the purpose
of college‘ is to “obtain an educa-
tion and to make social contacts.”
But education is foremost in all
cases and to that extent the Aca-
demics Committee will do all in
its jurisdiction to promote higher
academic standards at Pitt, Beer-
ing said in effect.
 To stimulate interest in “raw
materials present at Pitt but lack-
ing ineffectiveness” the commit-
tee is promoting the following
academic activities: the Interde-
partmental Major program, the
Council of Scholastic Organiza-
tions, the Humanities Society,

various academic traditions, and
high school relations in regard
to academic advantages.

Frat System Revision Asked

A revision of the present sys-
tem of fraternity rushing has been
recommended to lessen the strain
on fraternity men and new-com-
ers along with the promotion of
individual faculty advisors for all

students. Othergoals are the cre-

ation of a Dean of Freshmen, fac-
ulty and course rating sheets for
students, the establishment of a

Dean’s list and an honor system
for advanced courses.

The SC committee is working
on an expanded tutoring system
now performed by Phi Eta Sigma
and WSGA, co—ordinated faculty-
administration support for school
functions, and the periodical pub-
lication of a “Great Books List.”

In clarifying methods of opera-
tion, the Academic Promotions
committee has included the follow-
ing statement: “We want to raise
questions, not necessarily. answer
them; to criticize constructively
and contribute new ideas; to en-
courage, persuade and point out;
to suggest courses of action and
perhaps some new avenues of ap-
proach. In return we ask only to
be heard, although any and all
cooperation we may ‘receive will
be appreciated, too.”

Reception H elcl
For Parents Of
F rosh Again

The annual Cliancellor’s Recep-
tion for parents of freshmen will
be held this Friday, Nov. 6 at 8:15
p.m.

The event is designed to ac-
quaint parents of frosh with of-
ﬁcials and faculty of the Univer-
sity. -

When guests arrive, they will be
entertained with organ music by
Frederic Lotz, -University organ-
ist.

Theodore Biddle, Dean of Men,
will then extend an official wel-
come to the parents and introduce
various members of the welcom-
ing committee. Among them will
be Ross Reese/president of Stu-
dent Congress, who will speak for
the students of the University, and
the various deans who will speak
on their individual schools.

After Chancellor R. H. Fitzger-
ald speaks, the formal part of the
affair will end with choral selec-
tions by Men’s Glee club.

Visitors will then be conducted
to places of interest in the Uni-
versity. A reception will then be
held, when parents will have an
opportunity to meet and talk with
the ch-ancellor.

This is the ﬁrst in a. series of articles dealing with work being

done by the Universi_ty’s School of Engineering and Mines. The work. ‘

done here deserves attention since the nation, and the world is rapidly
becoming ,a World of Technology. Since Pittsburgh is the center

of much of the world’s industry, Pitt’s part is indeed, considered‘

signiﬁcant.

By JOHN De NINNO

For the ﬁrst time in the

history of the steel industry,

some of America’s largest steel producers are pooling their
knowledge concerning blast furnaces for the mutual bene-

ﬁt of the industry as a whole.

This exchange of information is being done at Pitt. It

is being ﬁnanced by a grant fromé

Advisory Board Organized

To facilitate the exchange of the
information an Advisory Board has
been set up here. ‘

The purpose of the Board is to
improve the method of “banking”
or “blowing in” a furnace. They
are doing this by exchanging
knowledge acquired from experi-
ence.

“Banking” a furnace is a method
of stopping a blast furnace while
still keeping the blast furnace hot.
Another way of stating the method

DeNinno

is to consider the ingredients of a-

blast furnace. These are iron ore,
limestone, and. coke. When the
furnace is “banked” iron ore and
limestone is not added while the
coke is. '

This is to allow the furnace to

Tickets are $2 per couple.

Music will be furnished by the

 

Smolder and thereby remain hot.

The amount of air blown into the
furnace is lessened but enough is
permitted to enter so that the bed
of coke at the bottom of the unit
will retain its heat.

Results of ‘Banking’ Furnaces

Blast furnaces are banked be-
cause of strikes or business reces-
sions. They produce pig iron which
is later used in the production of
steel. If the furnaces are not
banked correctly the lining of
brick would be damaged and as a
result would have to be replaced.

' The cost of relining one blast fur-

nace is approximately $1,000,000.

In an attempt to lessen this ex-
pense the companies comprising
the Advisory Board compared
notes on how their concerns did.
the job. This consisted of data.
from 12_dilferent companies.

Another process improved upon
by the Board was “blowing in” a
furnace, which is the method of
starting its production of pig iron
again once ithas been banked.

Report To Be Used As’Manual

Professor Gittins in conjunction
with the advisory Committee will
publish a report, the ﬁndings of
the group, entitled “A Study Of
Banking and Blowing In Blast
Furnaces With Recommended Pro-
cedures,” in thenear future. This
information will then be used as
a mill manual for blast furnace
operators.

Some companies represented in
the Advisory Board are the Jones
and Laughlin Steel Corporation,
United States Steel Corporation,
Republic Steel, Pittsburgh Steel,
and Great Lakes Steel Corpora-
tion. "

secretary of the committee
on yeducational exchange, the

largest number of students to

it began in 1948, enrolled this se-

MONTGOMERY "CULVER, riew
English instructor at Pitt, reach-
ed literary prominence when his
short story, “Black Water Blues”
. was selected for the 0. Henry
‘ Memorial Award Collection as
one of the Best‘ Short Stories of

 (

''_%‘ 

1951. ‘His prize-‘winning. story
was ﬁrst published by the At-
lantic Monthly Magazine which
deemed it the best “ﬁrst” story
printed by the “Atlantic” in that
same year. '

Culver Teaches Here
I By JUDITH GOTTERER ‘
Following his father’s example, - Montgomery Culver

returns to Pitt to teach.

Even when he was leaving the University to do research
for his Ph.D. at the University of Illinois he had planned to
come back as soon as his degree was completed.

An instructor in freshman Eng-
lish, Culver is interested in both
writing and teaching of writing
and hopes to carry on the “won-
derful work that Mr. Peterson
(Edwin L. Peterson) is doing in
this /ﬁeld.”

Short Story Wins

While at Pitt, Culver’s short
story, “Black Water Blues” was
published by “The Atlantic Month-
1y” magazine and copped several
honors.‘ Soon after the story was
published in MSS, it placed_ ﬁrst
in the 1950 “.Atlantic Monthly”

"contest for college students. ‘The

magazine selected it- as an “Atlan-
tic Monthly First,” later giving it
the magazine’s prize as the best
“First” story pri-nted in the “At-
lantic” in 1951.

The story reached its height in
fame when Herschel Brickell se-
lected “Black Water Blues” for
the 0. Henry Memorial Award
Collection for the Best Short
Stories of 1951. »

“Constant application and prac-
tice is necessary in creative writ-
ing,” the young instructor advises.
His story was rewritten approxi-
mately 14 times before comple-
tion.

Pitt Well-Organized

Culver ﬁnds freshmen English
courses at Illinois not as well or-
ganized as Pitt’s. At Illinois, in-
ﬂuenced particularly by Joyce, the
department advocates more radi-
cal and experimental writing.
“They are _more interested infor-
malists and patternists than in
basic fundamentals.

“I don’t think it is healthy in
the college student level,’’ he add-
ed. Culver believes a strong back-
ground should be taught ﬁrst. Ex-

perimentation may come only after
tradition has been mastered.

Culver backs the Pitt theory to
“Write what you know and write
it as concretely as possible}?

_ Father Commemorated

The M. M. Culver ‘Memorial
Scholarship in Mathematics is
given each year at Tap Day, in
honor of his father, professor of
mathematics at Pitt who died in
1950. Mr. Culver, senior, was also
interested in writing - and for a
hobby wrote poetry. '

Culver hopes to complete work
on his degree by summer, 1954, so
that he may start intensive "writ-
ing. He has fragments of a story
which he plans to make into a
novel. \. ‘

The .book, he says, will use a
university as background, “stick-
ing with the precept of Mr. Per-
cival Hunt, retired English pro-
fessor, of writing about what we
know.” -

As a record collector of blues,
his collection consists of .“very un-
common renditions with old and
strange labels.” '

MILITARY "BALL POSTS

Applications for those inter-
ested in working on the Mili-
tary Ball must be in the Dean

, of Men’s office by 4:30 Thurs-
day afternoon. Later that
same day the SC appointments
committee will choose chair-
men ‘and persons for other po-
sitions in room 804. I .

Applications may be ob-
tained from Miss Wagman in

In the future, none of. the loyal Pitt students
or alumni will point a proud ﬁnger at the 1953
football season. The reason goes without saying but
in the defense of our team I would like to submit
my opinion why our pre-season highly rated grid-
ders are not the rave of._ the nation.

First let‘s take a look at*last -year’s performance
—for that is the basis on which the experts rank-
ed the football powers in late August. ‘We c1ob-
bered most of the opposition with the exception
of Oklahoma, West Virginia and Penn State. Every-
one will agree that the Mountaineers and the
Lions should have been easy meat and the only
tussle wegshould have lost was the Okie tilt.

From the great team of 1952 we did lose seven
key men but it should be remembered that two-
pl-atoon football was still in full swing. On that
squad we had two All-Americans, Schmidt and
Kraemer, and a third Bill Reynolds, who.is now
burning upvthe pro ranks, and who should have
made theselect team. Well, we lost Schmidt and
Reynolds but we still had the Epps, the Kraemers,
the Fords and the Deitricks along with a strong
number of excellent frosh ready. to take advantage
of their eligibility. . ‘

Then came the NCAA rule of limited substitu-°
tion at the end of the season. _We suddenlyifound
ourselves back in what‘ the majority of coaches
and players call the “medieval years.” Our coach,
Red pawson busy  the process of building a
strong two-platoon football giant, looked up- from
his strategies and found he had to scrap his whole
plan and start anew- L

Springpractice came and went with the learn-
ing of fundamentals of defense'and'offense, the
main jobs of the Panthers. Then the late summer

- gun and the Mountaineers went home happy. Okla--

homa was next. Well the game is in the books
but we did outplay them even though’ we didn’t

have enough wind to beat them.

The Irish accepted us as the powerhouse we
were the year before. They were worried in that
ﬁrst half. Northwestern-—we just had to get that
one out of our system. Minnesota—we hit a new
low; not because the team we faced was so extra-
ordinary but because the new rule caught up with
our boys. Injuries are plentiful in our ranks after
Saturday’s test and I think we can lay the blame
to the’ limited substitution.

To back up a statement like.that I’ll use some
facts. Most all of the boys on the present squad
have played either offense or defense (never both)
since their high school days. Then in one season
they must learn a. comparatively new art.

. Sure some teams ’aren’t suffering at all, you
might think, but let’s hear what some coaches have
to say. » _ ‘

Lou Little, Columbia, “We were ‘nosed out in
the last half. minute by Princeton . . . there was_
nothing I could do about it . . . I was actually
afraid to make substitutions . . .”

“. . .' Once I put a man in I have to keep him
intill the end of the quarter not being certain I
have a better man on the bench. Five of my, boys
went 60 minutes against Lehighand another played
50 minutes. That’s tbo much,” ‘said Little.

Tus§,Laughry, ‘Dartmouth, “The. surprising thing
to me is the inability of players to go both ways."

s Pitt isn't alone in the wake of this single pla-
toon-guillotine which has been called “the greatest
leveler since mud.” Such power-packed outﬁts as
Alabama (rated to be "the top team in the nation

'by, Grantland Rice), Michigan ‘State, Ohio State,

Navy and -Duke have felt the stinging blow of the
new rule. -

I think amiable Red Barber summed up the
feeling toward the new system on, his CBS foot-
ball roundup, when he said, >

“How good is a football team?” He ans_wered

it with, “On what Saturday?” »

‘ The cat in this case is spelled
“Kat” and it means a two-footed,
upright character who wears

shoes. The tongue is my native
tongue, Eng-
lish, a_nd what. --
I don’t like is

that, but after
the kats got

Kat talk isn’t limited to one
word, though. Several words can
be strung together and given a

By the time you did ﬁgure out
that he meant ‘he -was going to
clip you in the jaw the kat would
have dropped that particular
set of words andicome up with
something like, “I’m going to lay
ﬁv'e’ on your chops if you don’t
stop moving the food locker.”.
Maybe ]that’s why»,kat talk is
so confusing. Just about the time
everyone gets to know a word
the kats drop it and ostrasize
anyone who uses it. A “square”
is now called a “cube” and any-
one who .calls a person a square
is even more of a square (or
cube) than the person who is
called a square. 1
Along about this time you’re
probably saying that it can’t hap-
pen here. Wake up,.son,'it has
happened. You may havefbeen
used to the familiar Christmas
carols, but come this Yule and
every disc jockey in town will be

is for everyone to become kats.

the silver voice of a Southern ‘

Democrat answering, “You all
shouldn’t say that, Great White
Father. We had that suede tax

There Are Bow Ties and Bow Ties ‘

By Jim Deweese
To tie or not to tie, that is the question. This
is not meant to be a parody on Shakespeare for I
am certain that if Bill were around today, »he would
consider the case of the pre-tied bow tie to be of
the utmost importance. ,
At present there are two types of pre tied bow
The
former is nothing more than a means of character
degradation while the latter is a lethel weapon.
When you put on abow tie by means of the
elastic band method you are courting disaster‘ by
several means. The ﬁrst'is slow strangulation. It
has been scientiﬁcally proven that prolonged and
constant pressure between the oral cavity and
the lungs will result in oxygen starvation. If you
must wear this type_ of tie, make sure it is not
too tight.
Careful of thelcad
Secondly,‘you present an excellent victim for
the practiCal’jokeste1'. He, the cad, will wait until
you are engaged in polite conversation with several
important individuals and then ‘he will make a
furtive grab for your tie and run across the room
with it before releasing it. V

ture) and asking yourself when the elastic will-
give out. If the elastic does break, you are ruined,‘
unless ‘you wear garters. And even if you do wear
garters and manage to replace the -elastic on the
tie with that from your left hose holder, you will
ﬁnd that your sox will nestle snugly ‘about your
shoe top. Either way you are socially wrecked.

Fraud I Say __ g
The clip—on bow tie_is a fraud from the start.

There are several requisitesnto the wearing of this ,

tie.‘ The first is the necessity of wearing a shirt.
Unless you havevery prominent collar bones, on
which to aﬁix the tie, you must wear a shirt. Sec-
ondly, the shirt must have a collar. And thirdly,
the collar must be stiﬁ enough to support the
weight of this metal encrusted piece of neckwear.
The stiﬁness of the collar is entirely inclejaenclcnt
of. this stiffness of the wearer.
True Bows Are Tops

As for the appearance of a man who is un-
aware that -his clip—on bow tie has become 50% '

-uniclipped, words fail me (anlunusual situation).

_So, once more all glory and honor return to the
self-tied bow and it regains its niche among the
most famous neckwear of an illustrious civiliza-
tion. It may look bedraggled and may be slightly

so many nations, but says Dr. Fin-
ney, “They all spoke German well
enough to ask for a glass of beer!”

Unfortunately, Dr. Finney could
not get accommodations in any of
the little towns where the music
festivals were being held this sum-
mer. He missed attending the con-
certs but had a proﬁting experi-
ence with a different series of
concerts. '

These were the ones given by
the Seventh Army Symphony Or-
chestra, with Thomas Auchterlonie
in charge: Theorchestra is made
up of 60 soldiers from privates to
corporals, no oﬂicers.

Went on Tour

When Dr. Finney met Tom at
the airport, Tom asked him to
come along on tour with. the or-
chestra. In the organization of the
symphony, men. had been chosen
from_~various battalions. who either
were in the band or could play
some kind of musical instrument.

Kettledrums, . violins, Violas,
cellos, basses, and other instr'u-
ments were purchased, and the
following months were spent prac-
ticing four or five hours a day for
the planned concerts. The group

has traveled 9000 miles all over‘

Germany giving concerts.
The, programs were varied. A

‘typical one presented Darius, Mil-

Walter
and

haud, Robert Schuman,
Piston, George Gershwin,
Giuseppi Verdi.
‘_‘Music Hath Charms”
This served a two-fold purpose
in introducing modern American
music to the German ‘people, and
in creating better feeling by les-
sening the stings "of occupation
with the_ subtlepower of music.
For encores, the orchestra often

‘ played «popular: German songs ‘ and
dances. Dr. Finney saw the en--

thusiastic response of the audi-
ence; but also _the marks of a beat-
en‘ people without hope for the
future.‘ ' .- . ‘ A

‘This was not his first visit to
Germany. ' V

He saw Munich again, reduced

to see it, mostly. because of its
nearness to this country.

¢ed out that “the outstanding fea-
ture of the game was the defen-
sive line play” of the Panther
Cubs.

Petro credited the frosh line
with stopping the Kent passing
attack by continually harassing
the opponents’ quarterback and
forcing him to throw the ball
away. As a result of this vicious
rushing, the defensive backs set
up three touchdowns by intercept-
ing hastily tossed passes.

Bob Rosborough, Dick Sherer,
Chuck Brueckman, and Dale
Brown were cited by Petro as an-
noying the Kent passer the most

positions. ‘ H ‘

John Pogozelski, Dan Wisniewski,

cellent job of stopping the Kent
ground offensive.” '

Cornelius Salvaterra initiated
the scoring with a 12-yard run on
a bootleg play in the ﬁrst period
of play. Jim Lenhart then ﬂipped

the end zone for a second tally.

After Kent scored in the third
quarter, the game ceased to be‘a

times in rapid succession.

Rex Peery, who has coached Pitt wrestling into the na-

expect to approach last season’s
ﬁne record. The 1952-53. squad
racked up ten straight wins be-

iLate Phi Ep Rally

N ips   Lams, 21-205

In a Sunday morning Intramur-
al football game that was worthy
of major attention, Phi Epsilon Pi

‘ downed Pi Lambda Phi by the
A score’ of 21-20. In the game which

haslbecome an annual institution,
the. Lams pulled out to an early
lead and the half ended with the
Phi Eps behind 20-0.

Speedy Carl Myers got behind
the secondary of the Eps to catch
two "touchdown heaves from. Herby
Myers, and Hank Browdy caught
the third Lam touchdown pass. A
safety completed ‘ the _ Pi Lam
scoring and then the Phi Eps took
over the game.

Safety Deqides Result

Nothing short of great play was
shown by Phi Ep as Sid Schaer
passed to Stu Michelson for one
score, passed another to’ Howie
Schwartz for the second, and on
a tricky end around play where
the end who takes the ballfakes
a run and passes to the other end,
Michelson scored again, adding the
extra point to make the score 20-
19, still in favor of the Lams. In
the ﬁnal moments of the game,
however, Buzzy _Litm-an broke
through the Lam line to nail

-..Herby Myers behind the goal for

a. safety, notching the ﬁnal score
at 21-20 in favor of Phi Ep.
Injuries Common

TH’e ﬁerce all-around play evi-
denced byboth teams resulted in

A two players being banished for‘

ﬁghting, a Pi Lam needing to have

stitches made to close a gash un-

der his eye, and minor injuries as
common as" the referees’ quick
whistles. »

The Phi Ep team’s defense held
the Lams to ‘virtually no gain in
the second half, and Ted Tabach-
nick played a big part in holding
back the Lam thrusts as he inter-
cepted three aerial_s.

The Panther soccermen went
down to their fourth loss of the
season Friday as they’ were de-
feated by powerful Frostburg, 3-

most of- the potent teams in the

district was just too much for the

made by Mike Culhane.‘ Com-
mendable play was also exhibited
by Norm Zanardelli, Noel St.

Don Corbett, Hugh Casper, and

Next Wednesday brings the long
awaited home debut of the soccer
team when they -meet Slippery

is hoped that there will be a large
turnout on hand to watch the con-

. NCE there was a ghost named Leroy, who lived in a
haunted cottage near a large Eastern university. Every
Friday night, at exactly seven o’clock, he’d slide under the
door of Baskerville Hall: (the main dorm), and give the students
all the answers to next week’s quizzes. ' '
This was quite a set up. No studying, no cramming . . . and
' -straight A’s all term long. But_ then, one Friday, the hour
came and went. No Leroy! And the following week, all the
Baskerville Boys got an F on every quiz! -
The Friday after that, all of Baskerville Hall waited . . a
and waited. But still no Leroy! In high dudgeon, they set out

to ﬁnd him. Creeping into Leroy’s haunted cottage . . .

the

Baskerville Boys found him moaning and groaning. ‘.§,What’s
the matter, Leroy?” they asked. ,

Leroy wiped a ghostly tear from his ghostly eye. “The
weather’s so hot, every time I put on a shirt’ the collar Curls

and wilts. I haven’t been out for two weeks!”

In high glee, the Baskerville Boys hurried to the local
Van Heusen dealer and bought a dozen Van Heusen Century
Shirts with the revolutionary soft collar that won‘t wrinkle
ever. Regular collars, spread collars. $53.95 for whites, $4.95
for colors. “A very good investment,” they thought.

Leroy was delighted. He rewarded the boys with all the
answers to the following week’s quizzes. Two months later,
all the boys from’ Baskerville Hall had ﬂunkcd out. Leroy’s
good-looking Van Heusen Century Shirts made him so popular
with the co-eds, that he didn’t have time for quizzes or answers.

Beering———Discrimination

(Continued from Page 1)

.. be nothing more than a group of
letters were they not symbols of

concepts and connotation.s. It is

" this hidden abstraction that makes

r

them real to us. A word is thus a
-living entity embodying a host
of meanings which affect diﬂ"erent

. users in different ways.

Eight Deﬁnitions Listed

The word “discriminate,” for in-
stance, in the Latin meant .“to
part or divide.” Soon it was used
abstractly and it assumed its new
meaning of “to tell apart or to
distinguish.” Currently, there are
at least eight oﬂicial deﬁnitions.
(See any comprehensive diction-
ary!) Some of these deﬁnitions
are as follows: to discriminate, v.
-—to note or to observe a differ-

,ence—-to distinguish accurately—

to dif‘ferentiate— to note or dis-
tinguish as different-to perceive
the particular, nice, or exact dif-
ferences between things, to de-
termine wherein these difference
eonsist, and to estimate their sig-
nificance.

It seems to me that College-
.ought to teach us to discrirninate

irnore exactly. Then, with sharpen-
ed intellectual vision, we can bet-
ter lead the lives of educated in-
dividuals. More of us should re-
discover the original meaning of

the term‘ and cease to discriminate-

againstit. This we may call the
scientific inﬂuence of our epoch
or maybe the McCarthy Approach.

But the biggest surprise was
perhaps that he didn’t do anything

about it after all. And that, too,
illustrates something about our
era—0ur general apathy. He saw
no longer anything interesting in
this little problem because 1) I
had agreed that he was right and

2) I had given him permission to"

quote me. What fun is there, how-
ever, in exposing such a thing?
As far as he was concerned, he
had emerged Victoriously and the
story ended there. "
Connotation Often Misintei-pirets

Did the story really end there?
Actually, I think, it points to quite
a basic problem: the problem of
words and how we use them.
Words begin to connote certain
things; they lose their original
identity and suddenly are over-
shadowed by a new series of im-
ages. Thus, “to discriminate,” to
our elevator friend, meant “To
make biased decisions in" favor of
or against something; while to me,
it meant merely “to m-ake distinc-
tions.” .

On the basis" of my deﬁnition,
we did indeed discriminate. We
made a distinction between those
groups that honor students for ac-
ademic achievements, and those
that tap students for activities
achievement. We thought this
nothing more than logical proced-
ure! "Indeed, without discrimina-
tion, all our campus groups would
lose their individual meaning and
deteriorate in-to purposeless as-
semblages. L
