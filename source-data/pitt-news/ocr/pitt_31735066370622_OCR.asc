Students say riots
not caused by rap

Frances Sansig
Staff Writer

”Rap attracts a totally different
crowd,” said Tina Nicholson, a Pitt
student who recently attended the
Run-DMC concert at the Civic Arena.
If this is so, it is exactly the type of
crowd the city of Pittsburgh wants to
prevent from gathering again.

After the Rene and Angela, and
Run-DMC concerts, Pittsburgh Mayor
Richard Caliguiri said, ’’I will no
longer stand for this hooliganism of
people coming out of rock shows and
causing us disturbances downtown.”

Added police protection and
screening of acts scheduled to appear
will be some precautionary measures
the city of Pittsburgh plans to take to
ensure that incidences like these are
not repeated. Rap music has been
particularly targeted because of the
rioting that broke out after the Rene
and Angela, and Run-DMC concerts.

LaTannia Brown, another Pitt stu-
dent who was at the concert, agreed
that rap music attracts a different au-
dience, but added, ’’It doesn't make
me do anything crazy.”

While some experts believe the
rioting may have been incited by
what Public Safety Directorjohn Nor-
ton termed ”provocative and por-
nographic lyrics,” some Pitt students
said the riots were not caused by the
music.

Pitt sophomore basketball player

Jerome Lane said, ”You can't blame
it on the music.”

James DeHoniesto, president of the
Pitt chapter of the National Society
of Black Engineers, said rap music
makes people rowdy, but added that
many other types of music have the
same effect.

’’It has a good beat and it makes
you feel good. It's that simple,” he
said.

Honiesto blamed the rioting at the
Rene and Angela concert on the lack
of efficient transportation. ’’It wasn't
what happened at the concert. It's
what happened afterwards. The ur-
ban youth would have went home,
but that night public transportation
wasn't run too efficiently," he said.

While Run-DMC’s recent LP ”Rais-
ing Hell” has drawn criticism from
those who have deemed its lyrics
suggestive, Kevin Wortham, a
backstage security guard at the Run-
DMC concert, blamed the outbreak
on the artists themselves and their
abusive language.

”They provoked people," he said,
adding that it was not necessarily
with their lyrics. ”They rap about
life.” He commented that the lack of
transportation and the media
coverage were part of the problem.
"There’s a major problem with pre-
judice [even] on [Pitt's] campus. The
point is that all suffer for just a few.”

Undergrad tuition
to increase again

Pete Brasko Ill
Staff Writer

Pitt students will be paying more
for their college education this fall.

The University of Pittsburgh
trustees have approved a $461.9
million operating budget for the up-
coming school year, calling for a tui-
tion increase of just over 7.3 percent
for most full-time in-state
undergraduates.

In-state tuition for undergraduates
in the colleges of Arts and Sciences
and General Studies, and schools of
Education and Social Work will be
$3,100 for two terms this fall —— up
from $2,890 last year —— putting the
amount of the increase at $210.

The cost for most graduate students
at the university will be going up 7.7
percent, although the exact amount
of the increase varies depending on
the academic field.

The cost per credit for part-time in-
state students will range from $104
for arts and sciences to $245 for
medical and dental students.

”Once again, we regret the
necessity to raise tuition,” said Pitt
President Wesley Posvar. ”The in-
crease is more than inflation, but we

"i think this will become one
of the top 10 public ‘research
universities in the country. I don't
want to underestimate the difficul-
ty.“ We've got Competing mis-
sions, and there‘ are always
"political tensions in a pllacle like ’
this," Benjamin said. ”There’s no
reason, however, that we can't
thoughtfully put these mosaic
pieces together.” .
Benjamin said he hopes to
focus on improving the quality of
undergraduate education. There
has been some controversy in-
volving the piacement ofdeans in

Benjamin to stay at Pitt

and changes to be made in »

various schools, recentiy in the
Schooi of Education ’ and

‘ 1p'I'-evi:ousi_*y‘ with ‘ the Scihooi of

. Phar?r‘nar:y'.i “ .

He said"he_is pleased with the

’ ?déij:i.siofns’ ’that"fhave been made
thus‘ far’, and that by piecing well-

regarded deans and faculty from ‘

.0ther_sch0O;|Is in the nation, the
administration is improving all
facets of the university.

“l’l'l even modestly say that the
university has managed to keep a
provost who, it was automatical-
ly thought, would go to the Big
10 [Minnesota]/’ he said.

Benjamin said the university
has a responsibility to be a leader
of change. He emphasized that he
will focus on the quality, not
quantity, of education in the next
five years.

’’I don’t think the future is

growth of some undergraduate _

this university is definitely one of 

have to face the fact that the cost of
living for the university is higher than
the cost of living for the general
public.”

The increase is in fact more than
double the rate of consumer inflation,
which experts expect to run
anywhere from two to three percent
this year. The 7.3 percent tuition in-
crease is, however, about the average
for Pennsylvania colleges this year.

Besides inflation, Posvar said the
increase is necessary because of
skyrocketing insurance costs and pay
raises for faculty.

According to Posvar, Pitt's general
liability insurance cost has tripled
from $400,000 a year ago to $1.2
million this year. Posvar also said pay
raises for Pitt professors and other
workers will be in the five to six per-
cent range to ’’help them gain a cou-
ple of notches on inflation.”

Posvar said that most Pitt students
receive some form of financial aid,
and the university will have more
than $50 million in university, state,
federal and private aid available this
fall to 35,000 Pitt students at five dif-
ferent campuses.

”For the middle-class student
whose family has to pay his way, this

numbers at all,” said Benjamin. ’
”l think we need to think, if not _
about capping enrovliments, at
least in terms of slowing the

programs, and be careful," j

Benjamin said he would be in-
terested in the post of president
of the university here should it
open in the next few years. ”Presi—
dent Posvar intends to, and I hope
he really does, stay another four
or five years/the said. ”lf l have

’’I know it's a ciiche, but i real- J

to serve in this kind of position," " "
said Benjamin. ”These pieces are

place to be.”

When he first arrived. here,
there was a great deal of anxiety ,
over the changes to be made.
Since then, the uproar has calmed
and most are waiting to see what
the first cycle of the planning pro-
cess Benjamin has overseen will
produce.

"I've been here three years
now, and the place hasn't been
destroyed," he said. ’’I think peo-
ple are starting to believe I'm not

Cuban refugeeon Staten Island Ferry kills two

United Press International

NEW YORK — Just one day after
New York's gala for Lady Liberty, a
homeless and apparently deranged
Cuban refugee from the Mariel
boatlift began slashing and stabbing
passengers on a Staten Island ferry
with a two-foot-long sword. When
the incident was over, two people
were dead and nine others injured.

Authorities said many of the
passengers were taking pictures of the
Statue of Liberty when Juan Gon-
zalez, 43, pulled out a sword he had
hidden in a bunch of newspapers and
began ”running around, stabbing and
slashing anyone near him.” Accord-
ing to authorities, the attack went on
for nearly five minutes before a
retired police officer managed to sub-
due Gonzalez at gunpoint. The
retired officer, Edward del Pino, is a
resident of Staten Island and a securi-
ty guard in Manhattan.

Police then used a body bag to
carry Gonzalez away after the ferry

docked. Authorities said Gonzalez
told them he has been homeless
since the 1977 boatlift and that ”God
told him to do it."

Gonzalez was picked up Thursday
by police after he acted strangely at
a shelter for the homeless and was
taken to a mental hospital. But the
hospital released him Saturday after
he promised to seek psychiatric help.

Dow plummets in
record one—day loss

NEW YORK — The stock market
took its steepest one—day dive in
history Monday as the Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials fell 61.87 to
1,839.00. The tumble exceeds the
previous record loss of 45.75 points
on June 9 of this year. Analysts said
traders returned from the long July 4
weekend in an uneasy mood over
evidence of continuing weakness in
the economy. The economic worries
coupled with statements by leading

analysts then touched off the record
sales and losses. A monthly survey
conducted by the National Associa-
tion of Purchasing Management
found declines in production,
employment and new orders, which
setoff the economic worries, said
analysts.

Japanese party
scores big win

TOKYO —— In what analysts say is
a mandate for the pro—Western
policies of Japanese Prime Minister
Yashuiro Nakasone, the Liberal
Democratic Party scored its biggest
postwar victory in Japan's House of
Representatives. Election boards in
the 47 states said that after counting
the ballots, the government party can-
didates won 300 of 512 seats in the
House. The Liberal Democrats had
only 250 ‘seats before the election.
The victory was sparked by high
voter turnout and the opposition’s

failure to offer alternative programs,
Japanese analysts said. Nakasone
described the triumph as a ”reflection
of our citizens’ voice, or maybe
heaven's voice, or maybe the voice
of God.” He added that he had not
expected such a large margin of vic-
tory for his party. The victory clears
the way for a possible change that
would allow Nakasone to serve
another term as prime minister. If no
such change takes place, Nakasone
will have to step down in October.

Supreme Court ruled a key provision
of the Gramm—Rudman Balanced
Budget Law unconstitutional, giving
back to Congress the task of cutting

usurped the president's powers. The
Gramm—Rudman Law, enacted last
December, is designed to set the
federal government on a five—year
course of decreasing annual deficits,
ending in a balanced budget by
1991. If in any of these years, the
president and Congress fail to agree
on a budget within the mandatory
deficit ceilings, across—the—board
spending cuts are imposed auto-
matically.tThe cuts are supposed to
be shared equally by all defense and
domestic programs not exempted in
law. The ruling means if President
Reagan and Congress fail to agree on
a budget within the deficit ceilings,
Congress would be able to impose
the across—the—board cuts through a
joint resolution that would have to be
signed by the president. But such a
vote leads to a sticky situation for
many Congressmen — a situation that
the unconstitutional provision would
have avoided — placing individual
lawmakers on record in favor of spen-
ding cuts.

Red Hot

Sovietjazz is introduced to the West

Bruce Kasrel‘
For The Pitt News

Although Pittsburgh is a city which
is rarely considered a jazz town, it
has been selected as one of a hand-
ful of North American locales mak-
ing jazz history. On July"10 at Graf-
fiti a Soviet jazz group, the Ganelin
Trio, will bring their free—sounding
style to the Steel City. This gig is the
last leg of what is the first Western
tour by a Soviet jazz ensemble.

For almost 15 years, the Ganelin
Trio has been the dominant force in
Soviet jazz, yet only a few outsiders
even knew they existed until a few
months ago. The group’s leader and
namesake is 42-year-old pianist
Vyacheslav Ganelin who is a
member of the USSR Composers
Union and has written compositions
for opera, television and movies.

Ganelin has been fascinated by
jazz ever since the early '60s. While
studying piano at the Vilnius Conser-
vatory in Lithuania, he started
performing with his own amateur big
band and formed his first trio’. Even
though much of his training on the
keyboards was based on Russian
classical romanticism, his style leans
towards the abstract. Often playing
the physical piano strings with a
mallet, Ganelin is one of today's most
innovative and unusal artists in any
countries jazz scene.

While Ganelin does some in-
tersting things with hardware store in-
ventory, the real showman of the
group is reedman Vladimir Chekasin
who has been known to play two
Saxophones simultaneously.
Chekasin’s style has been compared

began his studies in a conservatory
(the Sverdlovsk Conservatory) and
discovered jazz on his own. Winning
acclaim wherever he appears,
Chekasin has become a legend
among Russian jazz circles.
Ganelin, in an interview published
in the Soviet magazine Chorus in
1979, said of Chekasin, ”He is a law
unto himself. lncognito. A phantom.
I can only say that he has never
ceased to amaze us.” Chekasin is an ,
impulsive innovator on stage. His im-

petuous bouts with the main topic of
a particular selection is what gives the
trio its avant-garde and often chaotic
edge.

Speaking of chaotic, the Trio’s
drummer, Vladimir Tarasov, is a liv-
ing example of disorder. Playing a
multitude of instruments which in-
clude glockenspiel, spoons and
anything else he can get his hands

on, then using them to produce er- .

ratically sensuous and playful music,
Tarasov fills out the Trio perfectly.

Although hardly noticable from his
playing, Tarasov plays in the Lithua-

Prince: Mountains

Prince has got to be one of the
spaciest hip—shakers to ever fall off the
planet Cool. Loved as he is hated, this
master funksmith’s actions have a
tendency to polarize people's reac-
tions to him, ranking him amongst
some of the real ground-shakers in
the history of modern music. From
Elvis to the Rolling Stones to the Sex
Pistols, there will always be those
reckless few artists who refuse to
bend to the whims of the masses; art-

ists who have a permanent effect on
the way people interpret their culture
—— and, more importantly, on the way
they dance. Prince is one such artist.

At first glance, ”Mountains” is a
confused jumble of meandering
acoustics, windy trumpet stabs and
a blurry psychedelic fog of female
vocals in the stripped-down nature of
”Kiss.” If you're not careful, you
might even find your jazz boots jerk-
ing and careening their way out on-
to the dance floor, since Prince offers

only maximum soul power. Remem— ‘

ber, maximum soul power means
more pleasure for yourpartner which
means more pleasure for both of you.

After trudging knee—deep through

ches and phony teen-age love goo,

John Parr had neglected to include

nian Symphony, while the Trio is in-
active. He is the only member to not
formally sever ties with his classical
background.

With critics and music lovers rav-
ing about these three, S. Frederick
Starr, Soviet jazz expert and dean of
Oberlin College, needs only adjec-
tives to describe their brilliance —
witty, elegant, vulgar, theatrical and
surprising are just a few. One Lon-
don writer went completely wild
upon hearing them, saying, ”This

wildly funny, exuberant vital music‘

is guaranteed to rankle governments
and other stiff—necks around the
world. Roll over Chernenko, tell’
Tchaikovsky the news!” With such
high praise all around the globe, it is
unimaginable how the Russian
government could keep the Trio a
secret for so long. '

Part of the reason for their
anonymity is the Soviet government's
past aversion to jazz. Most every
leader from Stalin to Brezhnev found
it too unorthodox and enjoyable for
their citizens’ ears. Perhaps the harsh-
est words came from the novelist
Maxim Gorky who pins the blame for
the decadence of Western civiliza-
tion on jazz’s shoulders. Digging
deeper Gorky wrote: ”Listening for
a few minutes to these wails, one in-
voluntarialy imagines an orchestra of
sexually driven madmen conducted
by a man-stallion brandishing a huge
genital member." Boy does this guy
have a problem. Since many sided
with Gorky, jazz was forced
underground.

At first there were only a few bands
playing the circuit, but jazz soon
became the popular thing to do on
the black market. Albums were soon
selling for astronomical prices, and
listened to Voice of
America's jazz broadcasts. However
popular with the Soviet people, it was
not until Stalin's death in '53 that the
government wanted anything to do
with the stuff. But by then, the Rus-‘

' sians were a distant second to the rest

of the world in jazz circles. As a
result, they made the quest for jazz
another arena of competition. Not
only did they want jazz, they wanted
to be the best. i

The result of their efforts is the
Ganelin Trio. Since the secret was so
well kept, little did we know when
Reagan and Gorbachov met in
November that we couldn't even get

the upper hand in the cultural ex-

changes. And even though we may

cry out no fair to many of the Rus-

sian military maneuvers, the Cianelin‘
Trio is truly the most impressive rab-

bit from Gorbachov’s hat. You see,

these guys are beating us at out own

game — modern jazz.

Learning the benefits of living the high life

   

‘BACK IN THE HIGH LIFE
Steve Winwood
Island Records

John McCombe

Entertainment Editor

Some artists never escape the
limitations imposed by their pasts.
Micklagger instantly comes to mind.
His role as the prancing fool who
fronts the human riff machine will not
be forgotten until the Stones have
abandoned their rolling for good.

Steve Winwood has never con-

‘ fined himselfto a single role. He has

grown almost effortlessly from the

brash teen—ager who shouted.

”Gimme Some Lovin’ ” with The
Spencer Davis Group, to a demure

 
 

and respected adult musician respon-
sible for the timeless ”While You See
a Chance” from 1981 ’s solo LP Arc
ofa Diver. He has even led several
careers in between, including the
leadership of both Traffic and the
short—lived Blind Faith.

Winwood has now broken a three-
year silence with the release of a new
single and Back ‘in the High Life.
What makes this LP his finest solo
work to date is the sense of rebirth
that it confidently affords. The studio
hermit who produced both Arc of a
Diver and 1983's Talking Back to the
Night has opened up socially and
musically, appearing to be back in
the high life again.

High Life appears to be the work
of a man whose creative powers have
peaked. This record is excellent and
Winwood knows it. I suspected this
fact myself the first time I heard
”Higher Love,” the album's first
single. From the timbali-flavored tom
tom break that opens the song to
Chaka Khan's vocal fireworks that
end it, ”Higher Love” is five minutes
of pure pop pleasure that might not
even be the highlight of High Life.

That honor could go to either the
title track or ”The Finer Things,” an

update of"’While You See a Chance”
that includes an equally beautiful
keyboard introduction.

Only on ”My Love's Leavin’ ” does
he offer some respite from the high
life. lt’s a highly personal song, which
may be an expression of his feeling
of his recent divorce from long-time
wife Nicole. ’

I get the feeling from listening to
this album that Steve Winwood is
more concerned with counting his
blessings than dwelling on his losses.
He has abandoned one-man studio
efforts, instead surrounding himself

with friends like James Taylor, who
contributed harmony vocals on the
title track, and Joe Walsh, who par-
ticipates in a Hammond organ/guitar
duel on ”Split Decision,” a tune that
the two co-wrote.

”Split Decision” is indicative of the
exhuberance that flows from every
groove of this album. Winwood ex-
presses himself well on ’-‘Higher
Love": I could light the night up with
my soul on fire/I could make the sun
shine from pure desire. Could Steve
Winwood possibly do these things?
Back in the High Life has complete-
ly convinced me that he can.

CONFERRING WITH THE MOON

William Ackerman
Windham Hill Records

Douglas Payne
For The Pitt News

In the late '50s, Columbia Records
did some marketing research and
discovered that there existed an au-
dience hungry for something called
”mood music.” This mood music, as
it became known, wasn't as com-
plicated as jazz or as heavy as
classical, butit was, however, a
pleasant alternative by which
housework or homework could be

done while listening.

In 1977, William Ackerman took
a little musical talent and a heap of
business sense and created Windham
Hill Records, thus ushering in an en-
tirely new generation of easy-
listening, instrumental musical
generically known as ”new age.”

William Ackerman’s Conferring
with the Moon is a good example of
the strengths of Windham Hill and,
ultimately, the label’s weaknesses as
well. Ackerman is a very talented
conveyer of feelings and moods, yet
his guitar never steps out front to em-
phasize what emotions he's hinting
at. The title track, for example, has
the brooding ethereal quality known
to Pat Metheny’s acoustic music,
while Chuck Jackson's lyricon
enhances the piece much like Lyle
Mays’ synthesizer unifies Metheny’s
songs

Unfortunately, the music on this
record is easy to classify by cliches.
”Lago de Montanos” is unique in its
use of the charango, but sounds like
music for Zen meditation. ”|mprov
2" and ”Big Thing in the Sky” are

Psycho III converts
suspence into parody

Douglas Goncar
For The Pitt News

Psycho III is the second sequel to
. Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 masterpiece
of terror and suspense. The film stars
Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, a
young man behind the front desk of
the forelorn Bates Motel, which is ad-
jacent to the brooding Victorian man-
sion he shared with his mother.
Movie audiences’ 25-year fascina-
tion with Norman Bates is explain-
ed best by Perkins who said, ”  they
are attracted to Norman because he
is basically a trusting and generous
soul whose crimes are committed out
of self—protection rather than hatred.”
Unfortunately in Psycho III, Nor-
man Bates has become more rigid
and awkward, failing to display
natural, raw emotion for any extend-
ed period of time. Perkins’ character,
as well as the movie, has developed
into a parody.

Hilton Green, long—time assistant
director to Hitchcock, produced
Psycho III with the intention of ”mak—
ing a fine motion picture” rather than
simply emulating Alfred Hitchcock.
Psycho III fails to do so by produc-
ing a great amount of unintended
comedy. Perkins’ shocked looks,
failure in romance and pursuit of a
female reporter in a dress and wig are
so over-dramatized that the audience
of nearly 200 had tears of laughter
welling in its eyes.

Lead actress Diana Scarwid is the
only jewel in an otherwise lackluster
series of performances. Scarwid
depicts a pleasant yet naive woman
who runs away from a convent
before taking her final vows, uncer-
tain of what she wants from life or
from herself. Checking into the Bates
Motel, she is met with warmth by
Norman.

Anthony Perkins, who insisted on
directing Psycho III after reading the
screenplay by Charles Pogue, should

have let Hilton Green keep the reigns
as director. To say that the ac-
tor/director role is too much for
Perkins would be unfair. He has
proven in the past that he is an ac-
complished actor as well as an ex-
perienced play director, casting such
productions as the 1978 Broadway
hit Steambath. This film will surely
serve as a steppingstone for other
movies Anthony Perkins may pro-
duce. Sadly, Psycho III is a poor basis

Ackerman’s affinity for the

Conferring with the Moon requires
too much action on the listener's part
for positive reaction to Ackerman’s

The question of whether or not the
Pittsburgh School Board should im-

has been one of hot debate and con-
troversy currently, mainly because
the clinics might dispense birth con-
trol devices.

Across the nation, 52 school
districts have set up‘c|inics but only
10 systems dispense birth control to
their students, according to Dr. Helen

to the clinics’ distribution of birth
control devices to students.

According to the report:
”Diaphragm fittings, condoms and
oral contraceptives are included in
the current Pittsburgh school-based
clinics budget proposal.” But this is
not one of the recommendations
made by any of the subcommittees
in the task force.

The idea of school-based clinics is
not new, according to Faison. ”There
are clinics in St. Paul, Minn., that are
12 and 13 years old. There they
have found out that the health ser-
vices are being used by students that
are not reall" sexually active — so the

students use them for other reasons
than simply for birth control,” she
said. _

The task force's minority report
states that school-based clinics are
not needed because ”teens can
receive contraceptive services and
abortions readily and without paren-
tal consent.”

The minority report also states that
school-based clinics are not effective
in reducing teen pregnancy. Despite
a lower live birth rate and a lower
pregnancy rate, a lower abortion rate
among teens cannot be found. In ad-

being too expensive. It stated,
"although some private foundations
may fund some, but perhaps not all,
of the costs for the initial few years,
currently unmet and future costs will
soon be passed on to the taxpayers.”

The controversy has been very in-
tense, especially at recent school
board meetings. About 200 people
came to one meeting, over 80 of
them testified on the pros and cons
of such clinics.

Some people accept the idea of
educating children and adolescents
about sex, but have mixed reactions

about the distribution of co’i§tracep- .

tives by the school. David Plum, a
27-year-old graduate student at Pitt,
said students at the teen level should
be educated about sex. ’’It has
become more common, so why hide
it? If they become sexually active
early, they should know about [sex].
But I don't believe it’s the school's
responsibility to distribute birth con-
trol. Rather, the school or the
students’ parents should teach them,”
he said.

Some people see the distribution of
contraceptives as a positive comple-
ment to sex education.

’’If they don't get it [birth control]
they may not use it at all. I think a
school situation would create more
comfort for the individual. If people
are using contraceptives, they may be
less apt to have abortions,” said Ran-
di Shapiro, a Pitt junior.

Keith Mikush, a 20-year-old junior,
said sex education coupled with con-
traceptive distribution is a good idea.
’’I think the situation would be bet-
ter because there would be [fewer]
pregnancies. What kids don’t learn in
the home they have to find
elsewhere, and it's better to learn
from the high school than on the
streets,” he said.

Barbara Paull, director of education
at Women’s Health Services Inc. in
downtown Pittsburgh, said the clinics
proposal is a good proposal that
might meet a premature death. ”lt’s
a good idea totally misrepresented by
the opposition. They [school-based
clinics] offer a wide variety of services
and parental consent is needed for
those services. Birth control services
represent only about one-fourth of
the total services available. The peo-
ple opposed to it are really creating
false issues. They think the parents
will lose control, and that is not
necessarily so. If you attack it early,
before the school board has had a
chance to fully review it, then you're
killing something that could turn out
to be very good.”

The opinions are varied and the
arguments for and against the school-
based clinics are many, but according
to Chairman Frison, the decision will
be made by the school board at the
beginning of the next school year.

Colleges must
admit students
over athletes

The madness must end.

It has been three weeks since the
death of Len Bias and nothing has
changed. It has been two years since
Jan Kemp was fired from the Univer-
sity of Georgia for refusing to pass
undeserving athletes and nothing has
changed. It has been one year since
TCU was found to have violated over
100 NCAA rules in dealing with stu-
dent athletes and nothing has chang-
ed. It has been nearly a decade since
Coach Woody Hayes embarrassed
himself, Ohio State University and
everybody watching by punching a

Clemson player during the Gator.

Bowl. Still nothing has changed.

The time is now for colleges and
universities to put athletics where it
belongs —— among the lowest of
priorities. It's nice to have a winning
and profitable football program, but
at what price? How many must die
before the brakes are put on? How
many undeserving, athletes, who
have below the minimum reading
and writing ability required to
graduate from high school, will be
admitted to college?

Colleges must understand that to
grant admission to any athlete who
is sorely lacking academically is un-
fair, hypocritcal and unethical. To
allow athletes admission, squeeze
them through four years of eligibili-
ty with the barest number of credits,
and then turn them loose with
nothing but memories and 25 credits
left to graduate is criminal.

Colleges have a responsibility to
the public and to every student. They
violate that responsibility to the
public each time they admit an
athletically superior, but academical-
ly inferior student. Every undeserving
athlete who is admitted costs a more
deserving person the chance to at-
tend college. This is a crime. Colleges
violate their responsibility to the
athletes by letting them slide through
eas‘y classes designed not to educate
but to keep them eligible.

Colleges must end their obsession
with having a successful athletic pro-
gram. Why should Pitt compromise
its high moral standards for the
benefit of a winning football team?

lfthe answer is profit and prestige for S

the program by having a few games
a year televised nationally, then the
ethical fiber .of those who are in

" Bob
Travers

charge of the university and the
athletic program must be questioned.

So a few rules are broken, a few ar-
rests are covered-up, a few grades are
doctored. Who's hurt, they ask?
Where's the harm?

Colleges must -keep their thoughts
away from the bottom line. There are
more important things for a univer-
sity than its profit/loss column. Pitt is ~
not IBM. It is, along with every other
college and university in America, a
haven from a world beset with
materialism. It is on the quads, lawns
and classrooms of America's in-
stitutes of higher learning that
knowledge, wisdom and questioning

must still count for something. If it is '

the last place where they matter, then
this is even more reason to protect
our colleges from those who would
turn them into'r’nope_y machines.

The argumentis soinetimes made
that athletic money goes to support
other academic programs, that it is
often the lifeblood of a university's
recreational budget. Those reasons
are not good enough to support a

lying and cheating athletic program.

If it is a choice between cheating
to win and playing by the rules and
losing, a college must always choose
the latter.

Colleges opting to cheat destroy
everything they should stand for and
violate everything we hold to be
good about learning. Colleges which
put winning above learning have sold
their souls for the Orange Bowl.

It would be infinitely better for a
college to scale down its athletic pro-
gram, than to increase it through'i|-
legal means. A college must stand for ,
the‘ highest of ideals.’ A winning foot-_

ball program is not one of them.''‘. _

Every student in college should be
there only to learn. Education is
everything.

At least it used to be.

Fourth basketball recruit may be ineligible e

John Enright

Assistant Sports Editor

Chris Gatling, Pitt’s 6-8 recruit from
Elizabeth, N.J., can be added to the
-list of incoming freshmen basketball
players who may not be eligible to
compete in the 1986-87 season.

Originally, three Panther recruits,
Herb Barthol, Rodney Brookin and
John McNeil, were borderline
academically. On Monday, a Pitt
spokesman disclosed that Gatling, a
high school teammate of Panther
guard Mike Goodson, is also a ques-
tion mark academically.

All four players took the SAT for the
final time in June hoping to reach the
minimum score of 700, which, along
with a 2.0 GPA, is required for
freshmen athletic eligibility.

The academic guidelines, often
referred to as Proposition 48, were
recently adopted by the NCAA. They
are in effect this upcoming school
year.

The eligibility status of the four
players should be known by early
next week, when Pitt receives the
results of the tests.

Gatling’s case is a strange one. A
blatant error by his high school
guidance counselor led to the
problem.

Apparently, Gatling’s counselor
took his best verbal score from the
results of one SAT and combined it
with the highest mathematical score
of another SAT. The two combined
scores totaled more than the required
700, and the counselor assumed
Gatling had met the requirements.

The problem was that colleges re-
quire prospective students to take the
best total score from one test; that is,
students aren’t allowed to combine
scores from separate tests.

With this being the case, Gatling
had to take the test again in June in
an attempt to meet the 700 minimum
score.

”The Pitt coaching staff was very
upset when they found out about
this,” said a Pitt spokesman. "They
didn't think there was a problem with
Gat|ing’s SAT score. Now, it's up in
the air.”

If all four freshmen are declared in-
eligible, Pitt would be left with only
10 scholarship players for the season.

Although none of the freshmen are
considered impact players, two of
them, Brookin and Barthol, could

help the team as valuable reserves.
Brookin, a 6-5 forward from

Steeltown, Pa., was the MVP for the ,

Pennsylvania team in this year's Dap
per Dan Roundball Classic. He
averaged 31.2 points, 15 rebounds
and six steals a game his senior
season. Brookin has the offensive skill
to give the Panthers quality time at
small forward.

Meanwhile, the 6-11 Barthol has a
chance to see a good deal of time at
the center position if he shows
enough skill in fall workouts. But if
Barthol, a second—team all-state selec-
tion from Parma, Ohio, can't do the
job, head coach Paul Evans will go
with 6-10 convertedforward Charles
Smith almost exclusively at center.

For The Pitt News

When University of Pittsburgh
guard Bob Sign finished his routine
in the weight room, he looked
around the room. What he saw were
offensive linemen pumping iron, but
not the same people Sign plays with
during the season.

The players were former Panther
offensive linemen Bill Fralic, Emil
Boures and Jim Sweeney. They are
among a group of former Panthers
now in the NFL who work out in the
Pitt Stadium weight room on a
regular basis. Their efforts have
definitely made an impression on
Sign.

'’It helps me to see a person who
has already gone through college, has
already made a name for himself and
is now in the pros,” said Sign. '’It in-
spires me to want to do my best lift-
ing weights, running or whatever it
might be.”

Sign, a junior at Pitt from Lamar
High School in Arlington, Texas, is
expected to start at left guard for the
Panthers this year. He has already
been named an honorable mention
All-America by The Football News.
Versatility is his claim to fame. Sign
will also be the team's long snapper,
or, if needed, he will play center
when the Panthers are on offense.

"I'd like to think they can count on
me when they need me," said Sign.
"|'ll play centerpr guard. It doesn't
matter.”

What does matter is how Sign and

his teammates perform for new head
coach Mike Gottfried, but they feel
they have every reason to look for-
ward to playing for him. J
"We've heard nothing but great
comments about Coach Gottfried,”

Sign said. ”He tries to get a personal
relationship with each one of us.
He'll do what he can for us, but on
the other hand he's still a
disciplinarian. He wants things done
his way. If we do things his way,
things will be great.”

Sign, Gottfried and the other Pan-
thers are getting ready to start sum-
mer camp on August 12 at Edinboro
University. Following camp is Pitt's
six-game home schedule which starts
with a night game against Maryland
on September 1 and includes big
games with West Virginia and Miami
of Florida.

The upcoming summer camp will
be Sign’s first in which he works with
new offensive line coach Mike Solari.
Solari had a chance to see his left
guard in action during spring prac-
tice and liked what he saw.

"Bob is a real smart and consistent
football player,” said Solari. As a
result, Sign promised to spend the
summer working on techniques.

He hopes his hard work will help
to improve the Panthers’ record this
year, winning the hearts of many
fans. Two people who are already
fans of Sign are his parents, Bob and
Sue Sign, who travel from Texas to
attend every Panther game, whether
it's home or away.

Gatling

Wilson, N.C., is a talented guard, but
he probably won't be counted on to
provide any depth next season.

Gatling, the only freshmen player
signed by Evans (Barthol, Brookin
and McNeil were all signed by
former coach Rov Chipman), could
be the sleeper of the group.

A thin left-hander, Gatling aver-
aged 18 points, 13.1 rebounds, 5.6
blocks and 2.4 assists per game for
his high school team last year.

"Chris' best basketball is ahead of
him. He is a very, very good athlete
who runs the court well, handles the
ball well and shoots very well,” com-
mented Evans upon the signing of
Gatling two months ago. "He could
be a small forward for us or, if he fills
out, a power forward.”

Within a week Pitt should know if
any of these talented players will be
able to play next season.

Pens sign
free agent

The Pittsburgh Penguins an-
nounced the signing of free agent
Scott Johnson to a multi-year
contract.

The 22-year-old left winger led
Lake Superior State College in scor-
ing last year with 21 goals and 25
assists for 46 points in 40 games. He
was named the Lakers’ most valuable
forward last year, ending his college
career with 121 points in 155 games
at LSSC.

Lake Superior head coach Frank
Anzalone said of Johnson, "Scott has
excellent skating skills and great
defensive knowledge of the game,
and after the period of adjustment I
think he'll do very well at the pro
leve|.”

Johnson, a native of New Hope,
Minn., received his degree in
criminal justice at LSSC and became
the second player from LSSC to sign
with Pittsburgh in as many years. In
the spring of 1985, the Penguins
inked defenseman Chris Dahlquist.

Editor-in—Chief

Anthony Webb was born /uly 13,
1963. It was around that time that
Russia began launching its sputnik
rocket series into space. Thus, An-
thony Webb received his first — and
last -— nickname: Spud.

Since that time, Spud Webb has
grown up, so to speak. Standing only
5-7 at the age of23, Webb mystified
the nation last winter when he won
the National Basketball Association’s
Slam Dunk Contest. America fell in
love with this undersized superhero
and his spectacular array of dunks.
His appeal to fans soared just as that
first sputnik rocket did in the early
’60s. He played sparingly as a
member of the Atlanta Hawks,
averaging only 7.8 ppg, but he is still
one of the more popular players in
the National Basketball Association.

With his newfound popularity,
Webb has also realized a new life.
Posters with his picture now grace
the walls of shoe stores across
America promoting Pony basketball
shoes. He has also been a guest on
the Tonight Show with johnny
Carson.

Several weeks ago, Webb visited
Fitzgerald Field House at Pitt to
speak to players attending Paul
Evans’ Pitt Basketball Camp. He of-
fered some insight into what his life
has been like since he was crowned
the new king of the slam dunk.

Q2 Since you won the NBA Slam
Dunk Contest last winter, has your
life changed?

A! Too much!

Q: Is it really that bad?

AZ No, not really. It is mostly fun.
There are really no negative points —
they are all positive. You can't do
everything you want because people
recognize you everywhere you go,
but you try to do them anyway.

Q3 With all the traveling you do,
how much time do you get to spend
playing and working on your game?

A! Well, when I am not on the
road, I am in Atlanta — in the sum-
mer league — so I get my share of
playing.

Q! When you competed in the
Slam Dunk Contest, you were up
against some great athletes, including
your own teammate, Dominique

Q Wilkins. You are a foot smaller than

Dominique, yet you beat him. Do
you ever tease him about that fact?

A! Not really. When I am in
Atlanta, we are together everyday.
We play a lot, but we don't really talk
about the dunk contest. We talk
about signing for next year and mak-
ing the team better for next year.

Q: Speaking of signing for next
year, you are currently without a con-
tract. You are a huge fan attraction
because of your great athletic ability
and your ability to dunk a basketball.
Will that work as a bargaining tool
during contract negotiations?

A: Yes, it is definitely a bargain-
ing tool when I negotiate. When you
go to see a basketball game, don't
you like to see a dunk? Don't you like
to see Dr. J or Michael Jordan dunk
a basketball? It is entertainment.

Q: But in the same frame of
mind, do you think people may
overlook your ability as a ballhandler
or as a passer because you won the
dunk contest? You are a point guard,
don't forget, not a power forward.

A! Oh, definitely. The same thing
happened with Larry Nance [of the
Phoenix Suns] when he won it. The
same goes for Dominique also.
Everybody looks at his dunking in-

The Pitt News / Wednesday, July 9, I986 / Page II

No tangled Webb

stead of his ability as an all-around
player.

Q2 So what is better? To be
recognized as a slam-dunk artist or a
point guard who is a good passer?

A: As you know, in basketball
you have to do something spec-
tacular to get noticed.

Q! So I guess that means you
would rather be viewed as a slam-
dunk artist?

A! After I won the contest, there
were a lot of eyes on me. I don’t
know if it was because I was a basket-
ball player, a slam dunker or a novel-
ty. I think my playing proved I was
not just a novelty.

Q! Where did this superhuman
leaping ability you possess come
from? Did you build up your legs or
were you born with it?

A! I guess it is a God-given talent.
It's weird to really think about it. I
never really thought why me at my
size? It is a God-given talent and I just
want to use it to the best of my ability.

Who sez ya gotta be 6-4 to play in the NBA?
