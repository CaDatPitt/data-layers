Curtains, a platform and some
painted muslin will transform Heinz
house into a theater tomorrow and
Friday nights when Pitt Players,
student dramatic organization, opens
its season with a one-act comedy
and two ‘episodes from life. The
dwindling supply of free tickets in

Flummery,” opens the program. To

queathed a fortune on condition that
he’ changes his name to_ Wurzel-
Flummery. He wants the money, but
not the name. . . . .

romance between a ‘young gob, just
landed, and a working ‘girl, in a "city

co1legians_ who were asked what
they thought was Pitt’s peculiarity,
everyone gave a different answer.
Most found difficulty indistinguish-
ing between peculiarities. and gener-
ally undesirable. conditions.

A recent voter, still suffering from
his experience in Room 107 %, Alum-
ni Hall, nominated our election
methods for the honor. He waxed
indignant over ,‘_‘the absurd practice
of, allowing‘ candidates to "circulate
their own petitions for nominations”
and “the insolent behavior of can-
didates at the polls,” citing the in-
stance of a candidate who tried to
protest a ballot because the voter re-
jected him. _

Laboratory fees hold a certain"
measure of peculiarity, thought a
chemistry student. “Why tax this

property of using a laboratory,” he
asks, “when our tuition has already
granted us the privilege of delving

Alfred Ratner, president of Col-

the 0-0 game played with the highly touted veteran team
from “Little” Washington, -attention of - everyone is 11,0_W'nd1j'

lege Thanksgiving Day. Penn State is-coming to Pittsburgh» . .

with the one idea-"of winning the game. In fact, it has.been
said, that Hugo Bezdek, the “determined Mt. 'Nitta.ny- coach.

J ‘ has had this one game "in~view' all season. State has been

coming along steadily, after losing_a critical gamevto _Notre.

Penn State alumni are rallyirigc

around their team and urging them

I to come through with a victory in
this ﬁnal game with Pitt. Pitt has-

had the upper hand on the Centre
County crowd for a good many
years, and while the feeling is very
friendly and cordial, there is no gain-
saying the fact that State men
would give their good right hand,
and possibly a part of their left, to
beat the Panthers here on Novem-

V ber 25.

Colorful Game
The game will be possibly the

-. most colorful of the year, with the
possible exception of the Tech game.

State. is sending down its crack
military band, and the Pitt band will
be on deck with some new features.
State’s student body will attend a
hundred percent, and .the alumni and
students will be packed on both sides
with adherents of Pitt and State.

The advance sale of tickets to the

Pitt alumni is much heavier‘ than
-either W. & J. or Tech. There is
little football opposition on Thanks-

- giving Day, as the majority of col-.

lege and school teams have closed

their schedules. The result is that‘

the magniﬁcent Pitt Stadium will be
the Mecca of all football fans for
this ﬁnal big game. Alumni who
have not purchased their tickets
should get them at once. They
should also pass the word around to
out of town fans they can get tickets
by mail order. The prices for the
game are $3.00 and $2.50 in the side
sections and $2.00 and $1.50 in the

ends.
‘ A Hectic Season '

The State game will end the hectic
season which has had its ups and
(lawns. :When the season started
those “in the know” warned every-
one that with eight green men on the
varsity and the hard chedule to be
tackled, no one could hope for a de-
featless team. Of the 1925 team
which won eight out of nine games,
Coach, Sutherland started the season
with only three veterans. The 1925

season was one of the most phenom-A

enal in Pitt history, but when such
stars as Chase, Wissinger, Gustaf-
son, -Brown,
Kifer were lost and the schedule
tackled was the hardest in Pitt his-
tory, some defeats were sure to be
encountered. These have. come so
far in the Tech and Lafayette games,
but. great victories have been won
from West Virginia and Colgate, and
thrillin ties have been played with
W. &.  and G_eorge_towr_ two vet-

W. & J. last Saturday. Few people
picked the Panthers to have a chance
against “Andy” Kerr-’s veteran out-f
ﬁt, headed by the mat “Bill" Amos.
They not only he cl their own, but
had a slight advantage, having two
chances to,score to. one for W.~ & J.
It was a thrilling battle, both ‘teams
giving no quarter, and the tie score
possibly was the fair outcome. Alum.-

Coach Sutherland has done a re-
markably ﬁne iece of work, consid-
ering all the difficulties he has been
up - against. "

with Bellefonte Academy.
Dr. M. R. Hoag, Dent. ’14,— who was

a member of the football squad‘ here "

some years ago, is looking after the
boys in Lock Haven. He writes the
Alumni Secretary. he will meet the
team;, that he has made all arrange-
ments for practicing Friday--and for
their hotel plans. Many alumni of
the central part of the state will go
to see this game at Lock Haven, and
it will be a real battle. Bellefonte

has -been invincible in football, but '

Coach Carlson feels he has a chance
to defeat them this year. This is
quite a task, judging by their score
with West Virginia Freshmen Satur-
day, when they defeated the Moun-
taineer Plebes 67-7. '

Recital After Pep Meeting

.3; ivuuus swim!

‘Madame Estelle Gray-Lhevinne
and her famouscremona made their
second appearance before _- the stu-
dent body at assembly. Friday. The
45-minute. program followed the Y.-
and J. pep meeting,‘ and included '_ 6
customary appreciation and tone ‘test
of the violin, and explaniitory talks
before each ‘number. The general

 

and " the choice of selections was
guided by theonature of the audience,
says the artist. .

‘The “Londonderry Air" is an ad'-
mirable melody for demonstrating

also, the ;-Friml number, “After Sun-
set.’

,“Polonaise Brilliante” by Vieuxtemps
and the “Sarasota Habe:rna”'_were ob-
scured “by I the excessive speed, of
Madameﬁstempos. Tradition and our
personal aesthetics rebelled at the

men” with pizzicato and at‘ the ‘in-
crease of the speed in the Peer G’ t
selection; further we feel that neit er
number is appropriate" as a. violin
solo. The omission of the Cho in
Prelude, owing no doubt to the 1 m-
ited time, is to be regretted. .

and at . the same time giving the

is.“a good thing, as it islbeing’ put
on to‘ advance class spirit.”

A Fresh Meeting ’ '

About 150 freshmen shouldered
the. responsibility of assenting for
their class for the. continuance of
frosh regulations, as a climax -to
the class meeting in Memorial hall
banquet. room last Wednesday. Talks
by Gibby Welch, football and track
star, and Milton Saﬁer, and open
including criticism ’ of
the first-year men by a freshman co-
ed, marked the meeting’s program.
Alfred Ratner and J. E. Lindsey,
freshmen presidents, presided. About
.ten co-eds were.present. _

Only an aﬁirmative viva voce was
asked of the freshmen on the ques.
tion, “Are you in favorof carrying
outregulat;ions?” i i

Challenging the plebes to “throw
up- a background of tradition for fu-
ture freshmen,” Welch_ said impart:

. _The_ purpose of this meeting is
to instill pep in the freshman class
an_d_to stir up class -spirit. Class
spirit at Pitt is in a deplorable con-
dition. -Seventy-ﬁve percent of the
students have the ‘don’t care’ atti-
tude and the others are fault-'
ﬁnders.” ., g ' .

Speaking on the relation of fra-
ternities to school spirit, Welch de-
clared. that “the inter-fraternity
conference means more to the school
than student council.’’’

After explaining‘ the pushball
contest, Welch said, “I would solicit
your supportfor this scrap and for
class spirit. You should go out and
lick the sophomores. Let them -know
Y0}! are there. ;Competition will
bring about cohesion in your clagg,
Freshman regulations will bring
about better Pitt and class spirit in
the end.” i _ V . _

 Main Object At Pitt,

‘Education, Says K. E.

“The main object at Pitt is,‘educ.a_-
tion, not athletics!” says K.  Davis,
graduate manager of athletics. “The
Pitt athlete «either. studies‘ or he
doesn’t play football. The transfer
rule reiterates this principle, in that
it prevents anyone playing here who-
ever ‘played on any other college
team,” he adds. I
A In the opinion of Davis, football
does not lower the scholastic stand-
ing of players, but aids them to suc-
cess in their life’s' work.

 

cent of former Pitt football men are
making good,” Davis says. '
“Football is an. activity, just as
the band, the debating teams, or the
glee clubs. In fact,” says Davis, “I
have as much respect‘ for augood
debater as a football man. Both
have cliﬂicult situations tolface and
both must show ‘guts,’ not quitting
when they lose.”   l .
Mental and physical ldevelopment
are acquired on the footballﬂﬁeld, be-
lieves Davis, since decisionshavepto
be_-made quickly and under ﬁre, a
condition which develops the player
mentally. Rough training . builds
them physically, developing superior
men. ‘ '
“Most people take life too serious-
ly. ‘They adhere to a particular sub-
ject, seeing the world in a narrow
scope‘, instead of broadly. ‘They need.
a hobby. Football is ‘the hobby "of

 athletes, just as raising ,cl_iickens or

horse racingjis to others.‘
~ “Athletics are fine for everyone
concerned. They, create school‘ spirit
and interest. I ‘know alsuccessful
business man of Pittsburgh who is
worth 9. million, and he is most proud
of his letter ‘P.’.. " ‘
“Athletics are togbe encouraged, to
be aided, for theydo ‘not lower the
scholastic standing "at Pitt,” con-
cluded Davis. I '

 

Telegraphic Match _ -.

- V Opens ‘Riﬂe Season
' Telegraph wires will burn Friday
with the completion' "of the tele-
graphic match between -Pitt, Uni-

versity of California and Polytechnic.
Institute. The four-day match

“ . swung into ‘action yesterday when

Pitt gunmen began banging at bulls
eyes at the 176th armory range. '
On the ﬁring line for Pitt the re-
cently chosen varsity undergoes its
seasonal baptism. Firing in the
match are R. G. Atkinson, .M. D.
Crane, K. Diver, W. L. Lauler, Capt.
J. W. Lauler, H. B. .McKinney, V.
Pickard, M. Barletta and-G. E. Hall,
all of whom made the team through
a series of eliminations held since
September. - . .-

The dopefrom V. P._I. indicates
a strong team opposes Pitt on the
Virginia end. of the telegraphic tri-
angle. Riﬂe team recordsshow that
Pitt has always been the underdog,

V. P. I. has gripped them for the
last two years. - "

[The teams were evenly matched,‘
although. the Panthers had two
chances to score tothe visitors’ one.
The first Pitt chance resulted from

 recovered fumble. Carlin. fumbled

a hard punt by Hagan, which was
,recovered- Vb_y.Kern on the nine—yard
line. Three thrusts at. the line and
an incomplete forward pass failed to
ut the‘ ball- over the .line,_ and the
Presidents’ kicked out of danger.
; In the same period Wash—Jeﬁ?’s
only chance to break the'deadlock
was lost when‘ Edwards missed an
attempted field goal from the 24-
yard line. The all was placed in
position for the trialfollowing a 39-
yard run by Cleve Cook; Knoxville
lad. Cook was‘ the big gun for the
Presidents, even outshining‘ Captain
Bill Amos.
5 In the next quarter. Rooney at-
tempted a ﬁeld goal from avery dif-
ﬁcult angle. The try missed win-
ning the game by a very few feet.
