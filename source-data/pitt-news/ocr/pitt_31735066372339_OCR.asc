A recommendation has been
made by city officials and Pitt emer-
gency medical specialists that the
university replace itsiprivate emer-
gency medical service at home foot-
ball games with city paramedic
teams;

The recommendation, although
not directly connected to an incident
that occurred at the Oct. 24 football
game. has increased in emphasis in

light of the incident. in which a spec-

tator suffered a fatal heart attack.
The spectator, Donald D. Der-
rick. 46. of Bethel Park. was treated
at the scene by a stadium physician
and was taken to Presbyterian-
University Hospital. where he died
at approximately 3:20 p.m. that day.
In his report of the incident. the

stadium physician. Dr. Gregg Gold-
strohm of Pitt‘s orthopedics depart-
ment. added an extra supplement in
which he was reportedly critical of

. theemergency medical service pro-

vided by the ambulance service cur-
rently under contract with Pitt.

Perman Medical Service. Inc. is
the firm" that currently serves Pitt
football games.

Goldstrohm. while confirming
that he did write a supplement to his
report. would not comment on the
nature of that supplement.

“lt‘s potentially a very hot issue.’’i.
\ he said, “especially when you have

anybody involved when there’s a
death. And liability being what it is
in medicine. l’ve got to be very cau-
tious about what you (The Pitt
News) say. because that can be

Anti-Hazing Stance

D “The basic philosophy of the fra-

Pitt’s Assistant Director of Student
Activities and Greek Educational
Consultant Larry Lunsford told the
lnterfraternity Council Thursday
night. 4 A

Lunsford spoke against hazing
before fraternity members in a lec-
ture entitled “Pledge Education and
Retention Begins When Hazing-
Ends."

Lunsford is. a former fraternity
advisor and has lectured nationally
on . fraternity Concerns. The IFC
invited him to host their program on
identifying and eliminating hazing.

Lunsford said that people pledge
to fraternities because of the friend-
ships they offer. the loyalty and
honesty they instill in their
members. and the fun and excite-
ment they represent.

Hazing. Lunsford said. represents
the most publicity any fraternity
gets. — — .

Lunsford said that hazing can be
very dangerous and that many peo-
ple can get hurt. He said that 60
people have died across the nation
from hazing incidents since I900 and
20 deaths have occurred in the last
eight years.

“Ninety-five percent of all hazing
is done by fraternities." Lunsford
said. “Hazing is insane. Only our
ignorance can account for the
danger."- ~

that there ‘was inadequate treat-

The recommendation that Pitt
replace the private emergency medi-
cal service at the football games with
city paramedics is being spear-
headed by Drs. Paul Paris. director
of Pitt’s new emergency medical
residency program. and Ronald Ste-
wart. director of Pitt‘s Center for
Emergency Medicine.

Depending on the size. type and
number of people at the event. sev-
eral teams consisting of two‘ city
paramedics and one physician from

dle any emergencies that might
occur. Paris said.

Faculty Discuss Adopting Conduct Code

By MARGARET ATTWOOD

Faculty misconduct should be
dealt with as a faculty problem.
according to a report given to the
administration by the Senate Educa-
tional Policies Commitee. V

Professor Richard ' H. Pratt.
chairman of the committee. told co-

workers at the Faculty Assembly A

Meeting Fridayythatiinstead of an
administration-directed recording
mechanism toireiport to the Provost
instances of faculty abuse. the Pro-
vost ought to ask various depart-
ment units to ‘consider
themselves how they want to handle
instances of abuse within their own
departments. .

According to the Provost. there

among '

should be a code of conduct for
faculty members and a system to
report the number of abuses. and
that these reports should, become a
part of the faculty member’s perfor-
mance record.

The committee suggested to the
administration that they believe
each department_ should be asked if
they will consider such a system.

The‘ Pitt football team may have traveled to Boston over the weekend, but that didn’t
mean football was nowhere to be found on campus. The students above took advantage

_oi the last few days of cool fail weather to pick up a game or two on the Cathedral lawn.

The items for mode of conduct
reports suggested were;

0 meeting the first class on time.

0 conducting full period classes.

0 arranging foriadequate substi-
tutes in event of absence.

0 completing the full term by not
giving early final exams. A

0 arriving to class prepared to
teach.

0 keeping office hours. (This is
particularly directed toward evening
professors.) .

0 treating all students equally.

0 supervising teaching assistants.

The facultyiadvised the adminis-

tration that if withinia few years the ‘

in-department system fails. they
might then decide upon a more
legal-type systemof control.

Pratt also stated that. at this
‘point. the administration is operat-
ing on hearsay. without facts and
statistics. adding that the large
majority of faculty members are
conscientious.’

The Provost sees faculty absentee-
ism during finals week as the most

serious problem with as many as half B

of the faculty not completing the
term.

Profiles: Mark Symczak,Artist

By WALTER R. WATSON
Realism in the visual arts. is seeing
a progressive rise in popularity and
critical scrutiny. Gallery shows are
cropping up in major American cit-
ies where contemporary. free ﬂow-
ing. enigmatic abstract works have
left many people saying, “I like

 

going to shows where this stuff is
showing. You can plow through a
whole museum of it in nothing ﬂat."

  

  

There‘s good art and there‘s bad.
and yet one wonders where to go to
take a glimpse of what is perhaps
returning to the art world as “the
next big thing." Mark Symczak. a
Pittsburgh artist. whose most recent
drawings and paintings are on dis-
play at Pitt's UP Gallery. (Forbes
Ave. at Bouquet St.) is dedicated to
figurative tradition in art. The show
is far from the kind of work that
chases curious first timers out of gal-
leries and museums.

“Well." says Mark. a 27-year-old
self-employed artist. '“it‘s there for
you to see: There's lots of imagery.
it’s representational. it's got ele-
ments of surrealism. what more can
I say?" -

I guess l could say that as far as
making a living. my wife. Susan and
I make a few bucks here and there.
We pool our resources. you might
say. There’s the two of us. working
hard. Two heads are better than one.
that‘s the long and short of it.” he
adds. creating airs of mystery and
mischief concerning his art and his
life.

Mark’s work on display at UP
Gallery from now until Nov. l5_.
reveals a wide range ofimaginatively
and technically sound representa-
tions of skylines. interiors. and.
most clearly. people, His use of
colors often intensifies otherwise
dull rooftops and human figures. As
example. a pastel self-portrait.
which only exposes Mark’s upper

T body in a striped tanktop shirt. is

almost the direct opposite ofthe per-
son last seen at the opening of his
show nearthe middle ofOctober. He
appears less gregarious. more sensi-
tive. protective in person.

Graduating from the Art institute
of Pittsburgh in I975 with a degree
in visual communications. which. as
Mark is quick to point out. “is the
equivalent of a degree in the com-
mercial arts. It‘s that simple."

l have a good number of influen-
ces. the most influential one is  B.
Kitaj. a leader of modern figurative
artists." said Mark perhaps looking
ahead to his next show which will be
on display in April of next year at
the Wiebe Gallery downtown. Prior
to the current UP show. Mark had
an exhibit at the Pittsburgh Center
for the Arts.

“I like the city. Pittsburgh‘s a nice
place. l’d like to go to other places to
see what they’re like. I go all around
town to find places for inspiration.
Oakland‘s one of the places that l
use from time to time in my work. I
concentrate on rooftop scenes
because all the buildings around
here offer something very different.
very inspirational. you know‘? Up
there. you get a number ofdivergent
angles that give an abstract quality
to my art. I like different places for
different reasons." said Mark.

Pittsburgh’s locale isjust right for
the thingsithat l try to do. A lot of
my work emanates from models. My
wife is often a model for my work.
That’s her in ‘Sue of Pittsburgh. Pa.’
"That work is on display with the
current UP show." Mark‘s wife
works in an office building ofa large
corporation downtown.

Mark sees communication
expressed in visual terms easier for
him than speaking or writing.

“A writer can use clever tricks; he
can be imaginatfve and express
things that. well. that are sometimes

  

just works out better for me." said

‘New York. Chicago. I.. A. Artists

hard for me to get across. The image

Mark. who resides in the Pitts-
burgh’s Bellview neighborhood.

Mark sees a rise in the art appreci-
ation and development in
Pittsburgh.

“I think all the arts here are seeing
somethjing ofa boom lately. And it‘s
clearly seen in the visual arts.
because in the last couple ofyears. at
least four new galleries have opened.
They wouldn't be opening if there
weren't an interest." said Mark.

“The main reason for the atten-
tion given to art lately could be
because ofthe resurgence of regional
art and artists. The base of talent is
not as strongly rooted in places like

are being pooled from outside the
cities everywhere. from Texas to
Maine.“ said Mark.

When asked why he has chosen to
do work that is largely representa-
tional. Mark replied. “It's just what
you’ve got in your’ bones. lt's
abstract or realist. one orthe other. l
can‘t put my finger on it exactly."

Mark sees his life as largely some-
where between work and living.

“lt’s hard to separate the two. l
work in my house. my life revolves
around that. lt‘s not like a job that
you can just leave. It’s like l said
before. I work for myself all day.
everyday. lt‘s an endeavor that
keeps on going."

With the uttering ofthese words.
the interesting angles presented in
one of Mark's rooftop paintings

appears a metaphor for that expe-
rience. that work. where the vanish-
ing point is far beyond the water
towers and rust_v signs that hang
perched atop some of Pittsburgh’s
older apartment and factory build-

community.

Other lectures this fall have
focused on the problems in ;\orth-

science and pseudoscience and the
question of medical ethics in the
nuclear age.

The Cabinet has also scheduled a

four-part series on Reaganomics

a university program giving medic-
command and giving orders to the
paramedics. that the university at
least provide itself with the service."
Paris said.

Glenn Cannon. director of Pitts-
burgh‘s Emergency Medical Ser- '
vices. said the recommendation that
Pitt hire city paramedics is part ofa
city-wide attempt to have city para--
medic teams present at heavily-
attended events.

The management of both Three
Rivers Stadium and the Civic Arena
have been approached with the idea.
while the David l.awrence Conven-
tion Center has made it a policy to
have city paramedics on the scene at
any event with more than a thou-
sand persons in attendance.

Cannon said the university would
be charged approximately Sci) per
game for the service. which would
cover the costs of the paramedics. lf

’ a medical emergency occurred. the

patient would be charged for any
medical treatment received.

“What happens is anytime you
have a large crowd ofpeople. they’re

going to generate a certain number
of calls." Cannon said. “And Pitt
seems to generate a lot of heart and
cardiac-related problems compared
to Three Rivers Stadium. A lot ofit
may be due to the fact that at Pitt
you get a lot ofold alumni who have
been with the university for years
and years whereas at the Steeler
games you get all kinds of people.“

Paris said he has discussed the
proposal with universityathletic and
health and safety officials. and that
he received a positive response.

"I don’t think there’s going to be
any resistance from the universit_v. l
think thcy’ll realize that we can
improve the services that are pres-
ently provided.“ he said.

In the case of the event that
occurred at the Pitt—S_vracuse home-
coming game. (ioldstrohm. the sta-
dium physician. said he received a
message to assist in a cardiac arrest
occurring in section eight. the end-
/one section above the team locker
rooms at approximately 2:45 p.m.

(ioldstrohm said that by the time
he arrived. Derrick had already been
in a cardiac arrest. and that two
spectators were performing cardio-

Termination of Programs. also dis-
cussed at the faculty assembly the
complaints received from the geo
graphy department that the proce-
dures required for termination of
programs statedwin the Resource
Management System manual were
apparently bypassed. Investigation
suggests. according to the commit-
tee. that differences in interpretation
and lack of adequate communica-
tion were the basis of the conflict.

The two issues involved were the
need for prompt preparation of a
planning proposal when change in a

responsibility center is being con-
templated; and early \consultation
with effected faculty when the con-
templated change involves reorgani-
Iation or termination of programs.
The committee found no need to
revise the PRMS manual at this
time. suggesting that the problem is
a need for better communication
between faculty and administration.

According to Mulgrave. the
PR MS is not being followed by the
administration and the faculty
should be told in advance when
changes that affect them are being
made.

“At that time. appropriate resus-
citation measures were undertaken.“

.Goldstrohm said. which included

starting an intravenous and admin-
istcring appropriate drugs.

Shortly after the attack occurred.
Goldstrohm was assisted by another
physician and a person familiar with
emergency medicine who had been
sitting in the stands. (ioldstrohm
said that up until the time the other

physician had come down to assist. V

he had been in “the difficult posi-
tion" of having to apply a “bag-
mask“ or oxygen mask to Derrick in
addition to “running the code." or
coordinating the emergency
procedures.

"Ideally, in a cardiac arrest. you
should have one person who stands
back and gives directions to other
people so he can kind of keep a scope
on the overall situation. For what-
ever reason. I was unable to do
that.“ Goldstrohm said.

When the physician. whom Gold-
strohm did not name. and the other
spectator came down to assist him.
Goldstrohm then got a reading of
Derrick‘s heart activity from a car-
diac monitor. (ioldstrohm deter-
mined that Derrick had symptoms
of a ventricular fibrillation. or a
completely irregular heartbeat.

At that point. Derrick was defi-
brillated. or shocked three times on
his chest. in an attempt to return his
heart to a normal beat.

Derrick was then taken to Presby-
terian Hospital. where he died
shortly following admission.

Goldstrohm said Derrick would
have received the same level ofmedi-
cal attention. no matter which para-
medic service was at the stadium.

“I honestly believe that this gen-
tleman received the ultimate care
that he could have received. l think
that the difficulty arose in that

SGB Opposes
Scanlon Order

By CHRIS CLINTON

The Student Government Board
passed a resolution Thursday that
stated its opposition to Secretary of
Education Robert Scanlon’s gag
order on the presidents of the I3
state colleges and Indiana Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania.

ln what was termed a “clear
abridgement of the Constitutional
right of freedom of speech of the
presidents." SGB resolved that:

—The secretary of education
should rescind the policy directive
and publicly apologize to the state
school presidents; and

-—— The secretary of education and
the governor should publicly
encourage the presidents to speak on
behalf of their institutions without
fear ofsanction from the governor’s
office.

In September. Scanlon placed a-

gag order on the presidents of the
state colleges. In short, the order
stated that the presidents could not
seek legislat_io__n through state legisla-

_ tors unless what they sought had

been cleared with the commissioner
for higher education. the deputy
secretary for policy management
and the governor’s office.

AVE SOMETHING TO I

Chip Roth. chairman ofPitt‘s stu-
dent Governmental Relations Com-
mittee and one of the authors ofthe
SGB resolution. said that various
legislators opposed to the gag order
have asked student governments
across the state to make resolutions
against Scanlon’s gag order.

“They‘ll (legislators) owe us a
favor when budget time comes along
if we do something now,” Roth said.

He saidgthat Pitt would also make
some friends with the statewide stu-
dent lobbying organization.

Board members Mark (jalzerano.
Mary Pat Par_rell and President Bill
Abraham voted against opposing
Scanlon’s order.

After the meeting. Abraham said
the only» reason he opposed it was
because the GRC was asking for
Scanlon to apologize publicly for
the gag order.

He asked Roth if by endorsingthe

resolution the SGB would be “going

for blood" orjust for the withdrawal
of the policy. ’

“We don‘t want to stop communi- A
cation between us and the state i

government.” board member Todd
l)el.uca said. After a short debate.
however. the resolution passed.

Right Moves

Pitt would do_ well to act on a recommen-
dation made by city officials and Pitt emer-
gency specialists to upgrade. its emergency
care facilities at Pitt stadium.

Pitt currently employs the Perman Medi-
cal Service, lnc., a private firm, to handle any .
stadium health emergencies. But a recent
incident in which a spectator suffered a fatal
heart attack during a Pitt football game has’
raised some questions about the adequacy of
the stadium’s current medical care set-up‘.

In his report of the incident, the stadium
physician, Dr. Gregg Goldstrohm, added a
supplement in which he was reportedly criti-

’ cal of the service provided by the ambulance

firm. In addition, city and Pitt officials have
been urging Pitt to replace the private_ emer-
gency medical service with city paramedics.

Dr. Paul Paris, director of Pitt’s new emer-
gency medical residency program, said that if
the university employed teams of city para-
medics and resident physicians, it “would be
assured‘ of having the latest capabilities and
anyone who could survive will."

“It makes sense now that we have a univer-
sity program giving medic-command and
giving orders to the paramedics, that the uni-
versity at least provide itself with the service,”
Paris said. i

Paris’ recommendation is part of a~city-
wide attempt to havecity paramedic teams at
heavily attended events. The management of
Three Rivers Stadium and the Civic Arena
have also been approached with the idea. The
David Lawrence Convention Center "has
already made it a policy to have city para-
medics on the scene at any event with more

R than a thousand persons in attendance.

In light ofthe incident at the football game,
and the fact that Pitt could be utilizing serv--
ices for itselfthat it already, has, it seems that
the next logical step would be for the univer-
sity» to replace its current services with those

C of city paramedics and resident physicians.

So far. university officials have responded
positively to the plan. We would urge them to
continue further with efforts to bring the best
emergency care available to Pitt Stadium.

KURT WEINSCHENKER

By KEVIN B. CONNER

_ From September I976 to April
I980, l was a Pitt undergraduate.

Now it seems to me that every year, a ‘

t little after January. there is an article
in The Pitt News about a Pitt gradu-
ate‘s job. Contained within these
articles is always a pat—on-the-back
paragraph or two about how Pitt
prepared them for this job. They
never fail to amaze me.

Well, young friends, l would like
to disagree with these individuals.
First, graduating in 1980 and there-
after will be known as some of the
worst periods for getting ajob-—no
one will deny that. And Mr. Reagan

has almost certainly made sure of it.-

What I want to explore with you is
the idea that those of you coming
away from this school with a liberal
arts degree (or anything similar) are

‘ being given an education but not any

sort of preparation for the real
world.

Let’s face it, you may graduate a
“renaissance man," as our esteemed
chancellor is fond of saying, but that
and fifty cents will buy a cupgof cof-
fee. Since I left the university l have
been: A book sales rep for a vanity
house: an assistant manager of a
family-type chain restaurant; a grill
cook in a downtown good-times res-
taurant and a security guard. Now.l
don’t know about you. but none of
these jobs would seem to require a
degree in speech communications.

So here’s my point: the dean ofthe
College of Arts and Sciences says he
doesn‘t want to change the curricu-
lum so that liberal arts graduates are
channeled into the corporate world.
Well, my opinion is that he ought to
give it plenty of thought; because,
like it or not, that’s the only world
that's got jobs for you and me.

We are faced with a_ curriculum
that seems to be withdrawing from
the world——you can know small
group, nonverbal signals or the rea-
sons for the extinction of the
Aztecs-—— but if you can’t make heads
or tails of a profit,’ loss sheet. you're
sunk. _

l’ll give youan example of the

cruel realities you may face.'When l.

was managing the restaurant. I was
working 50-60 hours per week and
making an $l l.500 salary. Now, as a
security guard (unionjob), l’m mak-
ing the equivalent of that salary for
40 hours per week. l quit my restau-
rant job because they needed an
‘automaton, not an human, and.l’ll
,quit.t"he security guard job because
my brain will soon drip out of my
cars from lack of use.

What I‘m telling you is that once »

you‘re desperate e Jugh, broke
enough and frustrated enough
because you haven‘t found a. iob in

. Good LuekGrads-And Thanks, Pitt

your field, you’ll take any job you
can get so you can keep your apart-
ment and feed you face. You’ll live
on Original hotdogs and nine-packs
because you can‘t save the thirty
bucks to buy decent groceries. And
in your mind, you justify this
because you want a job for which
you went to school. Perhaps I
should be fair and not place the
blame totally on the school. The
world is a cruel place and l did learn
that on the streets of Oakland, an
education for which I’m grateful.
You want some more examples‘?
l’m not alone. I could tell you about
the friend who's a musician along
with having a degree like mine. He's
given up‘ music as an “idealistic
notion“ and figures he might get a
job writing public relations copy for
hospitals. l could tell you about the.
English Writing major who drives a
cab. Or the actor on welfare. It goes
on and on. I

On the other side of the fence are
the engineering students I know who
are making .more money this year
than most teachers will make in their

"first fifteen years of employment.

So. what can you do‘? You‘re vic-
tim of the times, a Christian among
the lions. a person with a capable
mind who doesn’t want to figure vec-
tors or take a patient‘s pulse. Well,
you can bust your butt or plug along

in mediocrejobs. Predictions forthe‘

coming years estimate the need for
lb0,000 more janitors, so cheer up.
What else? Why not move to one of
the occupational meccas in the

Southwest. Better yet, get into the-

armed forces (you’ll be an officer).
That way you haveia job. and when
World War lll starts, you'll have
figured a way to be in office duty or

some other‘ non—combat positionp
Good luck, future grads. And. uh,

thanks, Pitt.

Graphics That Mock
Journalistic Standards

Dear Editor:

As a graduate student at Pitt l
have come to value my weekly edi-
tion of The Pill News. Each week
you and your staffproduce a student
newspaper which is both informa-
tive and enjoyable". Having served in
a number of editorial capacities on
campus publications, I well appre-
ciate the hours and energies which
go into a quality publication. For

that ‘reason l applaud the efforts of‘

The Pit! News staff.

I was particularly impressed with
this week’s edition (Oct. 26) in which
a significant ‘amount of column
space was allotted to the problem of
violence against women. It takes a
marked amount ofjournalistic dedi-
cation and integrity to cover such a
story and focus the public’s eye on a
social issue so'real and.disturbing.
that we have historically ‘chosen a
cultural blindness to it. Asan under-
grad I attended a private collegethat
averaged four reported rapes. on
campus per semester. Byand large,
the student body was and is-unaware
of this situation on that campus. The

college administration considered,

the issue of violence against women

too “politically hot" and “academi-

cally distressing” for inclusion in the
campus paper. There are no words
to describe the feelings of an editor

who on proofing the first editions I

finds a well-researched, well-written
article on a current campus problem
censored and replaced by 500
words on the future of the intramu-
ral volleyball. The female student

body. faculty and staff have a right_

to know, and The Pitt News metthat

challenge well. _ ‘
What I cannotunderstand is why

the same issue of The Pitt News

" which focused so well on the prob-

lem of violence against women con-
tained advertising copy which is
blatantly sexist, cheap and insulting
to women. I refer to a 2" by 4" block
on page 5 containing a graphic ofa
type proven to instigate violence
against women. In short, such gra-
phicsmake a mockery of the jour-
nalistic and humanitarian standards
to which the staff aspires. If these
accounts are crucial to the paper’s
financial survival, design non-sexist
advertising. lf they aren’t crucial,
drop the account. I want to continue
looking forward to a quality campus
paper each week.

Freshman QB Almost Upsets Pitt;
Panthers Foil Late Drives, Win 29-24

By JOHNETTE HOWARD
CHESTNUT HILLS, Mass. —

Call him Fran Tarkenton’s legacy

_ Boston College signal caller Doug

Flutie led a Halloween uprising
Saturday that almost overthrew the
No. .l'-ranked defense——and perhaps
team-—in the country. Almost.

Flutie and a nightmarish fourth

“He was running around back

linebacker Sal Sunseri. “He did a

It was enough to send_the bewil-

Boston College smiled and nodded
their heads benevolently, even after

The Eagles late comeback left
Pitt’ defensive coordinator Foge
Fazio shaking his head too.

“The kid is fantastic. Unbeliev- '
able. That’s one of the best games a
quarterback has played against us,”
Fazio said. “He was on his back

underhanded.” ‘

For Fazio, an emotional coach
who, according to one player, cried
at halftime ofthe Pitt-West Virginia
game as he implored Pitt’s defense to
stop its sloppy play, life on the side-
lines was too nerve-racking. V

Playoff Spot At Stake

By LISA GRENEVICKI

The Pitt Panther soccer team
travels to Indiana University of
Pennsylvania tomorrow in a big
game that could give them the West
Penn Conference championship.

Under conference rules, the team
with the most points in the league is

‘declared champion. As of now,

under a complicated point system,
Slippery Rock is in first and Pitt is
second, even though the Panthers
have beaten Slippery Rock this year.

The conference is divided into two
six—team divis_ions. The divisions are
set up on the ,ba_sis of strength.
Stronger teams*are°in Division l and
weaker teams in .Division ll.

Each year, theN.o.l team in Div-
ision ll moves up to Division I, and
the last place:,,t‘eam in Division I
drops down t‘o“‘Division II.

The point system is set up this
way: A team recejives three points for

possible 2l p%(¢),.i:*rttsi.viThei team, unde-
feated in conference play, already
has l8 points and will achieve its
maximum point total with a victory

over IUP.

Slippery Rock, whom Pitt beat

A 5-0 earlier in the season, is leading

the league with 21 points. They play
all ll conference teams and can
receive a possible 27 total points.

With their loss to Pitt, Slippery.

Rock can now only gain a possible
24 points, which they probably will.
Pitt must beat lUP in order to
have any chance at the conference
cro'wn.
if the Panthers win, Pitt Coach
Leo Bemis will ask for a special rul-
ing at the conference coaches’ meet-
ing this week. . .
“The onlyiway we can be declared
champion is "if make an amend-
ment to the ctinference constitu-
-tion,“ said "Pitt Coach Leo Bemis.

“Our chances aren’t that good. The ‘

constitutiori is set up so we play the
teams in the league. l choose not to

Johnstown squad,‘ because they’re

schools wonitipiay us or don't have
room on the:ii',‘schedule.’' ,,
Before Pittgggcan worry about the
conference-”r-Mingi, they’ll D have to
have their game together or IUP.
According to Bemis, IUP is a
good team. with their strength com-
ing from their offense. A 63” IUP
layer from Nigeria, Tony Chiboukc,
is leadingjthe league in scoring. They

outcome went down to the final play i

of the top scorers in the league last

last two games.

“The last two weeks, we haven’t
been clicking the way we were ear-

work together’. Mistakes and‘turn-
_oyers cause the whole team to let

Afterjumping out to a 29-10, the

run, drove 88 yards in eight plays for

Title;Freshman Surprises

Steele aHit
AtStriker  

By LISA GRENEVICKI

Pitt Panther Jim Steele may have A

started out in soccer to get in shape
for football season back in seventh
grade, but now he's one of the new
stars on the Pitt soccer team:

Steele, a freshman and one’of
three players on the squad from
Trinity High School in Washington,
Pa., has earned himself a starting
spot at the_ striker position.

The striker is in the center of the
forward, line and is usually a spot
reserved for the goal scorer of the
team. This fits Steele’s playing
history--- he has been a striker since
his junior year at Trinity when he
switched from the midfield.

“The striker has to have a good
shot,“ explained Steele. “You have
to come back and help your mid-
field. You get the ball and take it in
yourself or distribute it to your

wings....You donft just play in the

center.,,You have to run back and
forth across the field constantly.”
And Steele likes the idea of run-
ning. He likes to run, but not for
competition. To-stay in shape after
the soccer season is over, Steele runs
up to I0 miles a day. » '

Disaster for Spikers

The Lady Panther volleyball
team’s race for the Eastern Regional
title screeched to a crawl on Hallo-
ween weekend as they returned
thrice-defeated from the Penn State
Invitational Tournament.

The first blow ofthe weekend was
dealt to the Lady Panthers by the
University ‘of Illinois. Pitt lost the
match ll-I5. I5-I3. ll-I5 and 6-15.

In their second match ofthe tour- '
nament, Pitt became the victim of
host Penn State. losing 6-I5. I5-I3,

. 4-I5 and l3—l5. Pitt's final confron-

tation was-against Rutgers. and
again Pitt was toppled by their
opponents 8-I5. I5-6. 9-l5. l5-I3
and 9—l5.

Pitt Coach Shelton Collier
summed up his perceptions of the

disappointing tournament.
“This weekend’s tournament was

typified by inconsistent individual 

performances. We played like we
practice~we had a combination of

several good and several bad plays ~-
those I

and we saw the results of
efforts." ,
Collier traced Pitt's failure to exe-
cute this weekend to a lack of con-
centration and desire. A
“This weekend. we faced [three
teams with more concentration and
desire. resulting in three consecutive
losses for us.” Collier said. “In situa-
tions like this the players say they are

trying. yet they do not seem to-"'“

understand that in competitive team

athletics. if your opponents are giv-

Penn State Upset;
Alabama Slips By

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

lt’s beginning to sound like a
broken record. Maybe college foot-
ball coaches around the country will
elect to banish the No.l ranking in
the polls, and just begin at the No.2
spot. The usually-coveted spot has
been an omen more than anything
this season. Just ask Michigan.
Notre Dame. USC. Texas and now
Penn State.

Penn State Coach .Ioe Paterno’s
quest for a national championship
suffered a severejolt Saturday as his
Nittany Lions fell short to a strong
Miami team. l7-I4. It’s not that
Penn State didn’t have a chance to
win the ballgame. Twice in the first
half. Penn State had first and goal
inside the I0-yard line. and twice
came away empty—handed.

On one occasion. Brian Franco.
who had been a model of kicking
consistency all season. missed a chip
shot. Franco went on to miss four
field goals. ‘

Following a host ofmissed oppor-

-tunities. Penn State still staged a

savage fourth quarter rally. Down
I7-0. the Lions scored two quick
touchdowns; Quarterback Todd
Blackledge. who wound up with 358
yards passing. a school record. hit

     

tight ‘end Mike MeCloskey' for

yards out.

Freshman Steele

Strikes it Big
With Best Shot  

cominueclg/rrmrpage ten

“l like to run." said Steele. “and l
do a lot of running at my striker
position. I can run all day.“

According to Steele, his style of
aggressive. hustling play was influ-
enced by his high school coach. Art
Richardson.

“Its the way l was taught.” said
Steele. “If Richardson caught you

‘walking during practice, you ran

laps. If he thought you were getting
lazy, he really got on you.”

Richardson must have done
something right. His prodding
helped Steele to become Trinity’s
third leading scorer with 42 career
goals and win All-WPlAL honors
his senior year. 0

Steele also was a standout for the
Columbus Soccer Club of Steuben-
ville, Ohio. this summer. He and

-some .fellow hometown players

helped the semi—pro team to the
league championship.

Now Steele is aiding Pitt in its 8-5.
v season as the Panthers chase the

West _Penn Conference crown. The
Panther booters will face lndiana of
Pennsylvania tomorrow in their last
conference game and a victory could
clinch the title for Pitt. 

Steele is one ofonly two freshmen

that have found a starting spot on

this year’s highly talented Pitt squad
and he‘s happy about t_hat.

“l‘m not used to sitting on the
bench." said Steele. “and l don’t like
it. but l’m glad I'm playing now. lt‘s
pretty hard for a freshman to come
in and play his first year."

Steele. who has scored twice this
season. is serious about his play- 
even if his attitude to most other
things is light-hearted.

“I'm like two totally different peo-
ple,” said Steele. “Before, a game. I
joke around and act like an idiot. but
when l get on the field. l'm real
serious. l get serious because l hate
to lose. There’s nothing that gets me
more mad than when we get scored
on.” ,

With the Pitt team having some
problems lately with tough teams.
how is Steele handling defeat‘?

“I guess you can say it motivates
me some when were losing.’ said
Steele. “I get pretty mad after a game
we lose. but after awhile l cool down
and forget about it. ljust look for-
ward to the next game.“

Steele will have a big gamieto look

,for'ward to tomorrow at IUP and a

long soccer career as a Panther.

“Soccer keeps me in good shape
and gives me something to do.’
Steele said. “It helps me to relax. l
just like to play because it’s fun."

enough.”

Collier"s expectations of winning
the Eastern Regional title were also

slightly dented during the chaotic '

weekend.

“This certainly takes us out of the
driver‘s seat at the regionals," he
said.“l honestly feel our chances of
winning regionals are slim since four
or five tcamsin the East are capable
of beating us. l’m not at all sure that
this team has what it takes to amply

prepare for regionals and win them.“

Prior to this weekend the l.ady_
Panthers had won ll oftheir last I2)
matches.

The loss that the Lady Panthers
suffered at the hands of Penn State
was by far the most disappointing,
according to Collier.

“Recently we‘ve been spending
the majority of our practice time on
serving and serve reception, yet
Penn State was able to continually
dominate us in both areas.“ Collier
said. “Despite this. l thought we
were going to win because their star
player. Ellen Crandell. was uncom-
monly ineffective.

The match against defending
Eastern champs was special for Col-
lier. which made the loss even more

‘bitter.’

LadyPanthers Lose Big

“I wanted to win the Penn State
match as much as any match this
year and afterwards I was embar-
rassed because the team did not per-
form as if they felt the same way."
Collier said.

The Lady Panthers will have a
week to regroup from their casual-
ties and prepare for this weekends
tournament at Western Michigan
University. The tourney should be
the second-toughest tournament of
the season for Pitt. after the Penn
State tournament, and it will also be
Pitt‘s final regular season

competition.

2 Poll System Needs To Be Restructured



 

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

Dear Mr. Pollster,

This is a desperate letter written
by a confused college football fan.
For years I have sat in front of.the
television on Saturdays eagerly
watching college football games. My
love for the game was unabashed.
After the last play had been made,
my attention would immediately
turn to your poll. I always eagerly
awaited your weekly standings.

Herein lies my problem. wise one.

Who is the number one football
team in the nation‘? This is a question
that you have failed to answer for
me. I’m quite upset with you Mr.
Pollster and feel that you may have
to become obsolete. Let me explain
my dilemma. A 1

About four weeks ago I watched
USC beat Oklahoma on television
and thought that the Trojans were
definitely the number one football
team in the nation. And you agreed
with me. POW. Two weeks later
USC lost to Arizona and they were
gone. Next comes Texas, who also
beat Oklahoma then they get
killed by 'Arkansas. Now begins my
tOrm‘ent. Oklahoma with a record of
4-2-1 is still ranked l9th in the coun-
try. Why‘?

Why were they l9th while Miami

 

(FIa.) was not ranked in the top 20at
all‘? From what I saw this weekend.
they’re just as good as anybody.
Your No.l team Penn State found
that out.

Texas, the team that was demol-
ished by Arkansas, is still sixth in the
country, while Alabama with one
loss and one tie is eighth. Something
fishy is going on here, Mr. Pollster!
Even Michigan, which has lost
twice, is l5th. Who’s next‘? Notre
I)ame with a 3-4 record‘?

Okay, let me get back to my origi-

~ nal point. Who is the best team in the

nation‘? Is it Pitt‘? They obviously
seem to have the inside track on the
spot after their narrow victory over
Boston College. But are they better
than Clemson. a team with an 8-0
record. coming off an 82-point
performance‘?

And are they better than Penn
State, losers. yet still deserving ofa
shot at the No.1 spot‘? How far will
they drop‘? "

In the past you have shown little
respect for teams from the East. Last
year after Florida State beat Pitt,
you dropped the Panthers from

three to I I. Now, look at Southern
Cal. With one loss, they are still
fourth in the nation. I say it’s
disgusting. .

Who helps you with these polls
anyway, Mr. Pollster? Do you do it
with a hangover on Sunday morn-
ings‘? Obviously you are not paying
attention to your duty. You have to
be objective. remember‘? You are not
supposed t'o like Bear Bryant more
than someone else.

Mr. Pollster it‘s about time you
became extinct. No longer will we
have to deal with your warped objec-
tivity if a sounder system could be
developed to see who is really No. I.

Who knows for sure ifa Miami, Ora’

Mississippi State isn’t really better
than a Nebraska, or a“ USC‘?
Develop a playoff system.

Have the top I6 or I0 teams inthe

country play in an elimination,touir— A

nament. How do you devise the
playoff teams‘? Some of those smart
guys working for'you.Mr. Pollster.
surely could come up with a suitable
idea. Then have teams play in the
same bowl games as now, but have
each bowl game be an elimination
bowl.

For example, have Pitt play Texas -

in the Liberty Bowl, with the winner
advancing to the Cotton Bowl, or
something like that.

Do you see what I mean,'Mr.

Pollster‘? Anything is better than

your system, where teams jump in
the rankings just because they are
going to be on television or they
have a big name.

Remember what you did to—West
Virginia‘? After the Mountaineers
were ranked 20th by your poll, they
came out and blew away a team by
42 points. SO what do you do, you
drop them from the top 20. Make
sense, right‘? What’s the matter,
didn’t you like the color of their
uniforms‘?

This year‘s revolving door at the
No.1 spot has proved to at least one
fan that you. Mr. Pollster, have got

to be stopped before you get out of .

hand. Before you vote Notre Dame
national champions or something
like that. You’ve done it before, but
hopefully you won’t do it again.

Sincerely,

An avid fan.
