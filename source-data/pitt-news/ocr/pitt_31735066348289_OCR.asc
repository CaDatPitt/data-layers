SGB Candidate Petitions

BY TOM SMITH

Circulation of petitions by candi-
dates for the January SG elections
would be limited to the fall term
according to election by laws
proposed by the Student Govern-
ment Elections Committee (SGEC)
at a meeting Monday.

Committee Chairman Chuck
Diedrich said the move would

" provide sufficient time to check for

petition infractions before candi-
dates could be certiﬁed. “The
committee should remember we
need adequate time to make a
thorough check of petitions to
register candidates,” he said.

A student must file a petition with '

the SGEC to ‘be registered as a
candidate and placed on the ballot

Candidates for SG Board need only
200 signatures.

Coal Negotiations Go C)n;
Steel Ponders Shutdown

WASHINGTON AP——Leaders of
the United Mine Workers (UMW)
reconvened‘ Tuesday" apparently
prepared to seek a reopening of
contract negotiations with the coal
industry.

The union’s 38-member bargain-
ing council was expected to re-
commend that UMW President
Arnold Miller return to the nego-
tiating table to win some modifica-

‘tions in a tentative contract agree-

ment initialed with the industry last
week.

“Obviously, some parts are going
to have to go back for renegotia-
tion,” said a union source.

Meanwhile, the nation’s biggest
steel producer took steps to offset

L production problems caused by the

curtailment of coal supplies.

US Steel Corporation, the nation’s
biggest steelmaker, said it would
start shutting down entire plants if
the coal strike isn’t settled by Dec.
1. Last week, US Steel announced
the layoff of 13,700 employees.

About Pitt Tenure Policy

The Pitt News features today an in
depth story on tenure at Pitt on
pages 6, 7, and 8. The (article seeks
to put into print the debate over
what some have labeled- Pitt’s

' . “tenure crisis.”

Tenure will be the subject of a
special session of the Senate Coun-
cil on November 22. That debate

will be centered on the recommen-

dations of the Tenure Commission
Report published last February.
That debate concerns the criteria
used in evaluating faculty for
tenure and the applications of those
criteria. The role of teaching in the

' tenure process will be :ex_am_ine‘d,
“ -_along»_v>yith'the rinci le of tenure in

relation to the present economic
situation and its affect on higher-
education.

Today’s Pitt News feature dis-
cusses these subjects at length.
The story, itself, took six months to
compile and involved close to 40
interviews with faculty, adminis-
trators, and students.

The story does not seek to resolve
the tenure crisis, not does it
portend to treat all the issues
involved with promotion and tenure
conferral. ‘However, it is indeed an
attempt to focus on some of the
most important _issues which dir-

~ ectly affect the student population

“When the’578 names have been
chosen, a second list of 100-200
alternates will be compiled at the
8:30 drawing,” Meloro said. “The
alphabetized names of the winners
on the first list will be posted early
Thursday morning in the residence
halls, the Student Union Ticket

‘Office, the Information Center, the

Student Government Offices, the
Pitt News, and the Student

The winners have until 3 pm
Monday to pick up their tickets.
After that time, any unclaimed

‘tickets will go to the alternates.

Each lottery winner will receive
only one ticket, but may exchange
it to obtain seating arrangements
with friends ,who already have
tickets. Exchanges may be

handled through the Student Union ,

Ticket Office.

“ Meloro said the tickets were made

available to his office on Friday,
but he’s not sure just where they
came from. As to the possibility of

iHands—-Free Experiment

Emergency Ca||boxesEpande

t BY MATTHEW KENNEDY
Pitt’s callbox ~. system, an elec-
t nic series of instant-response
phones placed around campus for
emergency use, has been expanded
to be included in elevators and
experimental no-hands phones are
in ‘process of installment.
Designed by University Director
of Fire, Parking and Safety Joe Gil
and a battery of University engin-
eers, the call box system has been
in working order since the begin-
ning of fall term‘ this year.
Experimental phones, using no
receiver, and operated by the caller
without use -of hands are still
awaiting installment, according to
the system’s designer and Director
of the Physical Plant Hunt Martin.
“What’s holding up installment is
about six parts you could hold in
the palm of your hand,” said
Martin. The small, but important
equipment is necessary to‘ connect
the experimental phones to the

main switchboard at the Varsity.

Hall nerve center.

The regular call box system has
been expanded to include all
elevators on campus, and some
call-box locations have been shifted
with an eye to convenience and
availability.

" Campus Police Training Officer

Sam Conte noted that thesophis,-‘

       

ticated equipment, along with the
new electronic alarm system being
installed at Pitt, would free the
Campus police for greater em-
phasis on human services.

“We’re not out in the middle of a
com-field, like Penn State,” Conte
said, “This university is in an
urban environment,
open to all the crimes in an urban
environment‘, sometimes even
more.”

“One night a lady was being
followed,” Campus Police Chief
Curt Graham said, “so she hit the
phone. The guy turned around and
walked away‘ when he saw her at
the call box.

“I don’t know of course, just what
he had in mind. Maybe he was
going to assault her or take her
purse, but if you asked that lady,
she’d say the system was worth a
million dollars.”

“A number of uses have devel-
oped for the phones,” Graham
added.

“Officers on a beat have been
using the phones to call in, which
cuts down on radio transmissions,
insures the phone is operational
and lets us know the officer is
alright.” '

Conte estimated nearly 25 calls

.reach a consensus_on further action
’_cdncerning the continuing crisis in
the black studies department.
~iI-lowever, a concrete decision was
'J'l0t’ reached due to .lack of a
quorum.

The crisis started when Dr.
Roland Smith, Camegie-Mellon
professor, was named head of the
{iblack studies department over BAS
yfavorite Curtiss Porter of Pitt. The
"result was a Black Student protest
irat the Chancellor's office, attempt-‘

Deputy chairperson, George van
Hook said before the meeting,

“This is to be our last meeting. -

The next one will be with the

But another meeting has been
scheduled for tomorrow due to the
lack of attendance at Tuesday's.

Despite the low attendance, BAS
chairperson Graylyn Swilley denied
any apathy toward the Black
Studies situation. “It’s not that it
is a dead issue," said Swilley.
“There were not that many people
absent from this meeting. We
could have reached a concrete
decision without them. But it
would not be a complete consen-
sus. I did not wish to exclude

(Continued from Page I}
just i recently approved by the
Student Government Board, the
elections committee has five days
to check petitions for infractions.
and certify candidates as being
eligible for office. ~

Committee member John Rohe
offered the motion limiting the
petition period to the fall term. It
was approved 3-0-2 with Diedrich
and Committee member Patty
Cooper abstaining. '

Cooper said, “A couple members
of the present SG Board have told
me that they made their decision to
run for office during Christmas
vacation and I think we should
consider that before voting.”

The reason for their late decision
according to Diedrich, who ab-
stained due to his role as chairman,
was the human impulse to delay

‘filing for office until the last

possible deadline. ,
Cooper, asked whether the com-
mittee would make any exceptions
“for those who won’t be in Pitts-
burgh this term for some reason.”
Both Rohe and Diedrich said no

exceptions could be made to the -

rule, and that a candidate need not
personally circulate his own peti-
tions. “A candidate could have an

associate circulate his petitions,”
Rohe said.

Rohe continued, “If we push
circulation of petitions into next
term, we’ll have a lot of problems.
We can't have a campaign without
certiﬁed candidates and if petitions
aren't due until next term we won’t
have any time to check their
validity. I l J

Cooper agreed petitions should be
returned before the end of the fall
term. She said, “I don't want to
see petitions out over Christmas. I
just want to see that everybody
gets a fair shake.”\*

The committee unanimously sel-
ected November 26 as the first day
potential candidates may begin
circulating petitions. All petitions
will be due in the Student Govem-
ment office (305 SU) by noon
December 16. The dates, however,
are tentative. "

“We,can’t select ﬁnal dates until

' the Judicial Board holds hearings

on the proposed by laws,” said
Diedrich. The Student Govern-
ment Judicial Board (SGJB) must
approve all bylaws written _by the
committee, according to the elec-
tions code. ,

The provision relating to the
petition period was one of the

Phone Sets To Be Installed

the operational phone system.
“Everybody has his own defini-

tion of an emergency of course,” I

Conte said. “If a foreign student is
lost on campus, finding out where
he’s at is an emergency.” _
The call-box system was initiated
as a method‘ of providing quick aid
for people in trouble at Pitt’s

Oakland campus, or to provide a
fast method of crime reporting b
witnesses. ;
The call-box phones were
stalled on campus after a combined
review of University officials and
student groups, in areas with

I high-density pedestrian traffic.

. “We can provide help in about a
minute,” Gil said earlier this year.

bylaws the committee" was author-
ized to write after Friday's Student
Government Board vote approving
the election code. Unlike the code,
the bylaws will not be permanent.

I A date for judicial board hearings

on the bylaws has not yet been set,
but Diedrich hopes the bylaws will
be approved by next week.

“They must be approved immed-
iately," he said. “If the Judicial
Board makes any unnecessary
delays in their proceedings we may
not be able to operate until next
term. That would be disastrous.

“Petitions could not be circulated.
The elections process could not be
initiated until the by-laws are

approved. If the elections com- '

mittee does not have sufficient time
in which to conduct the elections it
will be a definite impediment to our
ability to conduct a fair and honest
election, which is our only goal.”
In other action the committee
formally voted to rescind a previous
vote approving public campaign
financing of SG elections. “Due to
the controversial nature of the
subject the chair deemed it best to

involve other concemedupeople in,

the decision on piiblic ﬁnancing.”
Public hearings have been sched-
uled for tomorrow in the SU Dining
Room A at 7 pm.

The committee also selected
January 9 as the first day of
campaigning. No candidate may

, legally campaign prior to that date.

Other bylaws approved Monday by
the committee concerned the set-
ting of dates for a Meet the
Candidates program (January 15),
the Presidential Debate (January
20), and the inauguration (Feb-
ruary 6).

' Student Government Elections Ccmrnittee(SGEC) has decided to
public hearings on the signiﬁcant, but controversial issue of public
aign ﬁnancing of the Student Government elections. The
mmittee is actively seeking to involve the University community in
ecision making process, and this certainly will lead to an open and
nest election.
ection campaigns have never been ﬁnanced by Student Government
ore. The revenue for the candidates’ campaigns would come
_, y from the Student Activities Fee.
fblic ﬁnancing is indeed a good move. If each candidate is allotted
same amount of funds from the public treasury, everyone would
"an equal chance of being elected. «No organization supporting a
ctcandidate would be able to subsidize inordinately a candidate’s
_p.aign. No one candidate, then, would have a greater opportunity
‘ ' election.
, ver, it is quite apparent the committee, if it adopts the idea of
blic -ﬁnancing, as we think it should, must establish a ﬁmding
dure without ﬂaws.
1’ _ ,__thatis the burden on the shoulders of the election committee. A
it ' a -~ of options, though, are available. The committee could
s”uggestallcanq:aignmaterialsbeprocessedthmpghthecoimnittee
only University facilities. The SGEC would essentially be
 upon themselves the effective regulation of the campaign.
the other hand, the committee could set a spending limit for
 C didates allowing them to" rim their own campaign without
erference by the SGEC- The money they spend on their campaign
iildthen be refunded after the elections. However, this proposal is
g y and opens the door to countless rip-offs.
ierefore, we suggest the committee take it upon themselves to
 ely regulate the campaign. Public ﬁnancing will only work if all
" paign materials are processed through the committee. Because of
- GEC’s participation all unfair tactics would be eliminated. It is
__V.ei,r obligation to conduct a fair and honest election. And certainly,
 public ﬁnancing of candidates’ campaigns would lead to a fair and
chest election. .
urtherinore, the concept of holding public hearings by a Student
vemment committee is a refreshing idea. We hope many people

Letter to the Editor

Not Rejecting Porter

Editor ,

I have never been the one who
nodded his head in the affirmative
every time the administration made
a move. Or. the contrary I have
always been outspoken, at a
personal sacrifice, and critical
when in my view the administration
was wrong or when I thought it
used underhanded or unethical
methods to achieve their personal
goals.

Although such dishonesty occa-
sionally shows through on various
levels of the administration, I will
make one exception in a most
positive way, and that is, the
Chancellor’s office. It has always
been and is forthright, honest,
sincere, and very effective .in my
estimation. His stand with regard
to.the appointment of the Dean of
Black Studies is just that, and I am
convinced, honest. He says, in fact,
lets not make hasty decisions,
based on tempers still inﬂuenced
by a confrontation.

Let’s cool our tempers and define
our goals and then find the best
man under whom these goals can
best be achieved..The decision for
the selection of the Dean is the
responsibility of the Administration

An Instrument

it Of Death ‘

What is going on??? For the past '

number of weeks a propaganda
effort has permeated. the Pitt News
pleading for academic credit’for
ROTC. Their rationale? That Pitt
is one of 13 schools in the US which
offer ROTC courses without aca-
demic credit. Well, what about the
hundreds of universities that don't
even allow ROTC on' their cam-

puses.

No one is forced to enter ROTC
you say? In 1969 while I was a
freshman at Indiana U. of PA every
freshman was forced into two
semesters of ROTC, 3 hours aweek
of IV: credits. Fortunately enough
freshmen rejected this involuntary
servitude, boycotted ROTC classes,
and demonstrated against this
iniustice and now mandatory ROTC
is eliminated from IUP.

In 1968 and again last year
academic credit for ROTC was
denied for a multitude of reasons.
Then why. should we go through
this hassle again. ROTC cadets are
paid, no matter if they're needy or
not, over 100 dollars a month plus
books and tuition to attend college
in the name of the military. Are
football players, Studio Theatre
actors, et al to be given credit for
their extracurricular works in their
career selection?

And how many others at college

are paid to attend classes by a

- private institution? If the military

is so concerned with producing the
“best leaders,” then why should
they have to bribe their students
with money, easy credits, and a

 fancy uniform. Enough with these

academic hassles.

Let’s face it; ROTC is a death
institution, an instrument of the
military. ROTC’ accreditation was
eliminated in a furor of anti-war
sentiment in the late 60’s, and

hopefully, this same sentiment will

candidates for the Deanship at

thing of Concern to me is that those
who are promoting Curtiss Porter
for the position are not concerned
with any basic principles on which
selection is made.

They do not want to leave the
option of selection to those who are
responsible for the operationof the
university. They want to eliminate
the selection process completely,
because they want their man. Even
if he were the most qualified for the
position, this is still dictating to the
administration, because the em-
phasis is on eliminating the option
of selection.

I am shockedibeyond belief that
the students and the BAS in the
Pitt News are asking why Porter
was rejected. This is precisely the
point, he was not rejected. He
merely was not selected.

Separate and

J Uncredited

To the editor,

Two articles have appeared in the
Pitt News recently urging the
restoration of academic \credit for
ROTC. We feel that the values of
academic freedom and intellectual
integrity demand. that ROTC
remain, a separate, non credit
program. A university is, or should
be’, a place where freedom and
humanitarianism are the para-
mount values.

Within the university setting
people should be encouraged to
range widely and unfettered across
the realm of ideas. In addition, they
should be constantly examining the
effect and meaning of these ideas
on people. The military life is
diametrically opposed to these
ideals. Strict obedience is one of
the primary goals of military
training, the other being efficiency
in killing.

We hold that, quite apart from
arguments over the “necessity” of
the military or of its methods, these
goals‘ are incompatible with the
aims of a university, and therefore
should be kept strictly separate.

For those people who desire such

training, let the military alone be
Iresponsiﬂble for providing new
  '  ti‘ es ’“but'kee

   

   

       

then, their inpufis made. If they
claim that only one person in the
world is qualified for the position
then they say that he is God and in
my opinion that should disqualify
him. A

My point is, that your complaints,
confrontations, disagreements with
administration decisions, etc., have
nothing to do with the process. You
are not concerned how the
University selects its deans,
faculty, administrators or how it

performs any University functions. I

You are concerned with one
individual, Curtiss Porter, irre-
spective of any other issues; that, I
do not believe, is your responsibili-
ty or right.

Again, do not be so harsh on Mr.
Porter, he was not rejected. At

present, having whatever inputs I ‘

have, and they are only what I
read, lam of the opinion that, now,
Curtiss Porter would be the wrong
choice for the Deanship.
appointment would do more harm,

than the good he can do, and I I

believe he can do a great deal of

Military Training ’
On Pitt Campus

Dear Editor:

I am disappointed that the ques-
tion of ROTC credit has come up
again. Now seems to be a ripe time
for its proponents to bring up the
issue with the events of the late
’60’s not as sharp in our minds.
Yet the truths of those years are
still truths today. ROTC is run by a
part of the government. What
other outside organizations come to“
Pitt, clamp onto it, and teach its
philosophies? Who pays the ROTC
instructors’ salaries?

As to the armed services’ need for

_ officers, why should a person who

is ‘truly interested in becoming an
officer spend four years on a
campus first? _ His inclinations
should take him directly to the

' service for leadership training and

not to a campus which is not at all
responsible for such training.

Courses could even be taught in a
civilian setting at the Federal

Building. In addition I am at odds
with the concept of the military and
war. ‘I cannot understand why
countries ritualistically confront
each other and kill off portions of
their populations,
gained?

The great majority of Pitt’s male
students have not gone to a
battleﬁeld to kill other humans--or
even worse, to drop bombs from
planes on people they can‘t even
see. This is so totally foreign to us.
Yet I realize leaders of other

countries would hardly agree with .

me, so I cannot realistically recom-
mend the abolishment of Army and
Air Force ROTC. However. I hope
that the CAS Council keeps some
distance between the University
and ROTC and doesn't change its
mind about giving credit to ROTC

Nit-picl<in g p
And Rhetoric

Dear Editor,

Mr. Joseph White (“Intelligence
and Abortion Rights” letter, 10/18)
is indeed honest when his last
sentence implies his own tenden-
tiousness (characterized by strong
opinions).

But, he says that “students might
feel reticent about criticizing a
faculty member.” All students?
Are we talking about the same
students? Why should they criticize
me? Well, Mr. White says,
absolutely, that “through literary
devices like ‘Karen...once that egg
gets fertilized, you’re talking about
a new person no one has the right
to kill”’ my letter “comes off as
patronizing.” "

That’s simply Mr. White’s opin-
ion; no patronizing was intended
nor did several of my students and
colleagues ﬁnd it. Thus, his
scolding about my manners and
principles is unjustified. One could
nit-pick: the quoted sentence is a
matter of style, not device. For a
real rhetorical device, let’s watch
Mr. White. ,

He says that “a snappy, one
sentence formulation” cannot “a-
dequately replace disciplined intel-
lectual discourse”--and then he
gives a snappy, one-sentence
formulation that he buries as a
subordinate clause.

That’s his basic premise, yet he

that he's said almost nothing.

"Relative Value

Of Humanity

To the Editors:

I feel neither reticence not com-
punction about questioning the
views of a faculty member: there-
fore, I will respond to Mr. Joseph
White’s attack of Dr. Joan Huber in
the 18 October Pitt News.

As a student, I find Mr. White’s
initial remarks regarding possible
student apprehension about critici-
zing an instructor to be extremely
condescending. And when he con-
tinues with what he calls “disci-
plined intellectual discourse,” he
concludes with the notion that

.. humanistic principles are not pro-

life.
It is only in warped Machiavellian

humanism that the belief in indi-
vidual human dignity goes so far as
to allow one person to destroy
another. Human dignity mustlbe
the same for all, regardless of size,
age, "sex, race, or creed: individu-
alism cannot be carried to the
extreme of condoning the denial of
the dignity of another human
being. And a simple biological
investigation will determine that
the unborn child has a genetic code
which marks him or her as unmis-
takably Homo sapiens—an individ-
ual and human entity.

If one accepts the premise of
imminent and inalienable human
rights, than they must be applied
equally to all people; if, on the
other hand, you reject this meta-
physic, Mr. White, then we do not
have to be concerned with “abor-

tion rights” any more than the’

right of life: we have no rights.
Nor can I accept utilitarian at-

' tempts to “evaluate” human life. It

is indeed only "through an accept-
ance of artificial standards that one
may begin to decide the relative
value of human beings. I suppose I
should be pleased that I am neither
an unborn child, nor aged, nor
mentally retarded, nor Jewish-

because the last time someone
tried such a heinous experiment,
they all were slaughtered. Hitler
believed Machiavelli.

Student Health
Insurance Plan

Dear Editor:

This year's student health insur-
ance plan, which is a “fringe
benefit" for each graduate em-
ployee at the University of
Pittsburgh, represents a drastic
change in coverage over the
previous year’s policy. In the
recent mailing regarding the new
policy, the university administra-

tion made no attempt ‘to’ indicate‘

the following signiﬁcant alteration:
the policy now includes a $100 per
person (maximum $300 per family)
deductible clause for health care
needs not provided by the Student
Health Service. Most graduate
employees are ‘unaware of this new
deductible clause and, because the
university has ignored its duty to

expecting expanding enrollments
and it just didn’t happen that

V way,” said Moye.

“Six hundred thirty-seven to a
thousand fewer students enrolled

' at Pitt than expected in 1973. Now,

we're being told the birth rate is
decreasing to the extent that the
18-year-old population will be
much smaller in 5-10 years than we
predicted. And given these reali-
ties, we may have to release some
people.”

Provost Rhoten Smith, whose
duties include recommending to
the Chancellor the conferral of
tenure for a faculty member to be
promoted, expects that these
changing conditions in higher edu-
cation will affect the number and
quality of tenured appointments.

"The key problem today is that
we've come out of a long period, of
almost 20 years duration, in which
it was literally true that , most
institutions, including the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, awarded tenure
to faculty who did their job satis-
factorily. Someone who contributed
to the endeavprs of the University
had a right to think they would be
tenured. But that is no longer the
case." . _

The many tenure disputes at Pitt
in recent years involving faculty,
who think they have met the
criteria for tenure conferral, and
administrators, who think someone
with better qualiﬁcation can be
hired, bear out Smith’s remarks.

The tenure process, referred to as
the “tenure stream,” is comprised
of four ranks: instructor, assistant
professor, associate professor, and
professor. When a faculty member
is promoted to the rank of professor
or associate professor, he is award-
ed tenure. A -faculty member,.
however, can be hired as an
associate professor without tenure,
and then be required to meet the
criteria established at Pitt for
tenure.

The Board of Trustees has the
authority to grant tenure, but these
powers are delegated to the Chan-
cellor.

TENURE DISPUTES AT PITT

To be awarded tenure a candidate
must first be approved by his
colleagues at the departmental
level, who then make a recom-
mendation to the dean of the
particular school. The dean’s re-
commendation is sent to the Pro-
vost, or in the case of the health
schools, the Vice Chancellor of the
Health Related Professions. The
case is then referred to the Chan-
cellor, who informs the candidate
in writing of his decision. A
negative recommendation any-_

a nonconferral of tenure, but in
some cases a decision on a faculty’s
tenure may be deferred or post-
poned until the following year,
according to Smith, “in order to
give an ‘individual more time to
develop if that’s possible.”

lfa faculty member is not promot-
ed to the rank of associate profes-
sor by the end of his sixth year in
residence at Pitt, the administra-
tion notiﬁes the candidate tenure
will not be conferred. And faculty
member may not serve at Pitt more
than seven years without a confer-
ral of tenure.

Pitt’s most noted tenure dispute
which began in 1971 has still not
been resolved. That case involves
Dr. Sharon Johnson, an assistant
professor in the School of Medi-_
cine, who claimed she had been
denied tenure on the basis of sex.
Johnson ﬁled charges alleging sex
discrimination with the Equal Em-
ployment Opportunities Commis-
sion, which authorized her to ﬁle
suit in United States District Court.
Claiming she had been discharged
in violation of amendments to the
Civil Rights Act pertaining to sex
discrimination, Johnson ﬁled suit
in February, 1973. She won a
preliminary injunction retaining
her position on the faculty until
further order of the court. The case
naming the University of Pitts-
burgh as a defendant and support-
ed by the National Organization of
Women (NOW) is still pending.

Most other recent disputes have
involved the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences, the largest academic unit
at Pitt. Procedures which led to
unfavorable decisions for candi-
dates in the Earth and Planetary
Science, French, Biology, Chemis-
try, and most recently the Speech,
Linguistics, and English Depart-
ments have been questioned.

In response to this faculty dissat-
isfaction with the tenure processes,
FAS recommended in April, 1972
the establishment of a commission
appointed by the Chancellor to.
conduct a long range investigation
and analysis of the tenure system
at Pitt and alternative tenure
systems. The report of the Tenure
Commission published last Febru-
ary, has once again stirred a
campus-widedebate of the tenure
process.

It is generally accepted that a
candidate. for promotion or tenure
conferral must fulﬁll the Univer-
sity’s three criteria of excellence in
teaching, service, and scholarly
work, an extension of which is
publication of research.

There are many faculty who
contend the criteria are not applied
fairly when publication of research
is given more importance than
teaching in the evaluation of a
candidate’s credentials.

As one untenured faculty member
said, “The issue is whether you get
promoted for the work you do or
staying at home writing books.” ,

The chemistry department is one‘
example of this, according to Vice
Chancellor Moye, who is also a
tenured-faculty member of that
department. “In the chemistry
department you damned well bet-
ter be a good researcher if you
really want to get tenure. You can
slip by being a bad teacher there,”
he said.

The History department also re-
quires a candidate to publish a
manuscript to be tenured, accord-
ing to Van Beck Hall, a _former

‘president of the Pitt Professional
andyian associate

. -[PPU].

  

professor of History.

But, FAS Dean Jerome Rosenberg
denies research ‘is given more
importance in the evaluation of a
faculty’s qualiﬁcations for promo-
tion and tenure. Both teaching and
research are important, says Ros-
enberg, but he does admit a
faculty’s efforts to excel in the area
of service are minimally recognized
in the evaluation process.

Dean of the College of Arts and
Sciences (CAS) Robert Marshall
agrees with those who think that
publishing is inordinately empha-
sized in the tenure process. “There
is far too much emphasis on
publication,” said Marshall, “and
that’s because the system" values
research.

“There are three criteria,” Mar-
shall continued. “You should say if
one demonstrates excellence in one
or two things tenure will be
conferred.”

Then, it is possible that a faculty

member recognized as an excellent
teacher could be denied tenure
because his research is inadequate,
according to President of the Pitt
Chapter of the AAUP Ray Rich-
man. “The administration is saying
that without publications none of
the other achievements make any
difference. ,

“The University does have an
obligation beyond teaching, but the
most important thing in an under-
graduate program is good teach-
ing. lt’s not destroying the quality
of the University granting tenure to
a good teacher.” ' - _

Teaching is a far more important
mission of the university, according
to Moye, labelling it “very wrong”
to deny tenure to a good teacher for
failure to publish "adequately.

“We approach research, in my
way of thinking, as if each one of us
is going to win a Nobel Prize,” said
Moye. “But, we just keep the
literature‘ cluttered with mediocre
material because we're mediocre
researchers.

“I really love research,” contin-
ued Moye, “but I know there are
other things that are more impor-
tant. I think there is some value in
taking'a student and stimulating
him to the point that he would allow
me to get inside him, give him the
skills to do research and watch him
go off exceeding my capabilities all
the way. That is as valid to me as
publishing a damn mediocre paper
which only ﬁve people in the
country will read.” '

TEACHING AND RESEARCH

Rosenberg is bewildered by these
types of complaints from faculty
and says the undergraduate faculty
must excel in research as well as
teaching since Pitt has a responsi-
bility in both those areas. “The
University is one of the few places
that house scholars who do re-
search. Where is a person going to
go for a job who has research

ability? In FAS we want people who ’

can teach and also make contribu-
tions to research. That’s what
we’re here for.”

Not all faculty, however, maintain
teaching as an important criteria
for tenure conferral. Hall admits
that a faculty’s teaching ability
cannot be considered when evalua-
ting a candidate for tenure.

“A-teacher's classroom perform-
ance is not important in determin-
ing tenure,” Hall said. “You know
a lot of people fuzz this and tell you
that it is a criteria, but the difﬁculty

is how do you really. know_ if
someone ..is a good . teacher. It’s- ‘

    
 

very difﬁcult to evaluate somebody
else's teaching. If somebody comes
up for tenure, I haven't been to his
classes.

“But you can read a person’s

professional work and get a good_

idea whether it’s exciting, and
new, or whether its pedestrian, old,
and a piece of junk,” he adds.
The failure to develop a teaching
evaluation system at Pitt, accord-
ing to Dean Marshall, is an
indication the University is not
tryly committed to good teaching.
“You can tell what a system values
by the way it evaluates,” said
Marshall. “We do not value teach-

V ing because we have not come up

with a system of evaluation. It is
clear and self-evident to me that if
the system valued’ teaching it
would come up with a way of
evaluating teachers.”

Though agreeing that the system
does not value good teaching,
Moye blames the faculty for an
unwillingness to evaluate the
teaching ability of their colleagues,
and adds the faculty are not
committed to good teaching.

“If we theoretically really look
hard at what someone else does
and make some kind of decision, it
would be a judgmental decision.

For some reason the faculty don’t

believe in that.

CAS Dean Robert ‘Marshall

“Many faculty, themselves, don’t

know what good teaching is or how
to even approach it,” said Moye.
“And yet at the same time that I
admit we don't know what good
teaching is, we have not devised
any schemes to try to improve our
techniques, skills, not have we
done a damn thing ‘to generate
interest among our graduate stu-
dents for good teaching.”
_The vagueness of the written
criteria for tenure conferral, ac-
cording to Richman, allows the
administration to evaluate tenure
canklidates very subjectively. It is
for this reason the AAUP is most
concerned with due process in
tenure cases, and Richman insists
the reasons for a tenure rejection
be speciﬁed to prevent any admin-
istrative impropriety.

‘‘I think the criteria for tenure are
valid--the notion that teaching per-
formance is an appropriate consid-
eration, that publication is an
appropriate consideration, that
professional activities are an ap-
propriate criteria, or contribution to
the" University, University-wide
committees or department com-
m'ittees--that all of these are valid
considerations,” Richman said.

“But what we object to especially
on the negative side is a statement
that a person has been denied
tenure because he or she has not
published sufﬁciently. We want to

know somethingabout-quality in, __ in

there. We want to know if an
individual is not a good teacher, we

want to see some evidence. We
want it to be documented, not
subjective.

“Otherwise, it's whether your

department chairman or the dean
likes you or not. We don’t want that
to be a criterion. We want to make
sure that every effort is made to
support a negative judgment.
Otherwise. you are subject to the
whims of authority.”

The guidelines for the conferral of
tenure and promotion to the rank of
associate professor, which Rich-
man refers to, are contained in the
Faculty Handbook. Labeled as
“window dressing” by Hall the
guidelines read, “An associate
professor ‘should have completed
all formal academic preparation for
a teaching career and have sub-
stantial experience in teaching,
research, advanced study, or ap-
plicable non-academic professional
experience. The_ person should
show a capacity and will to main-
tain teaching effectiveness and the
ability for continuing growth as a

teacher, scholar, and member of V _

his or her profession. He or she
should also have progressed in
attaining eminence in a scholarly or
professional field.

“An associate professor‘ must
display consistently mature per-
formance in course curriculum
planning, guiding. and counseling
students and younger staff mem-
bers, and participation in the
activities of the University.”

These guidelines are so general,

 ’”\according to Marshall. they can be

"ﬂu...

interpreted to mean many different
things at any given time, and he
cites his tenure case as an example.
“I do not ﬁt the guidelines as they
are being implemented today,"
said Marshall.

“I have not published and if I

’ were a candidate this year I would

not be--tenured because today is a
period of non-growth. When I was

,i.-"’“‘- a candidate we were in a period of

growth.” .

Provost Smith has no objection to
the subjective nature ‘of the criter-
ia. “There is a certain subjectivity
to this kind of thing and I wouldn't
apologize for that. I love my wife.
It's kind of subjective, but it's
important."

Smith adds it is his responsibility
to correct any errors made in the
application of the criteria, and in
this way to insure that all tenure
candidate are evaluated on the

same basis. “You might say my

function in the process is to make
sure there's a relatively equal
application of standards through-
out the University- '

“I can’t have ‘one school down
here and another school up there
though the standards may differ
because of the different missions of
the schools. There’s got to be some
kind of comparability so that the
English Department has standards
just as high as FAS andjust as high
as the Law School and so forth.”

This subjectivity leads Van Beck
Hall to think of the tenure process
as only a series of political hag-
glings and not really as an evalua-
tion of the faculty's excellence. “If

 department is very‘strong and

  

has strong candidates it will scream
like hell if they don't get tenure,_"
he said.

“On the other hand if you have a
department that's coming apart at
the seams because the senior

, promotion.

  

rnembers aren't speaking to each-.

other and when they do they're
screaming at each other, they send
a recommendation to the dean and
the dean's going to sit there and
twiddle his thumbs.”

When asked if politics was in-
volved in the conferral of tenure
Smith replied, “That’s a loaded
question. I’m a political scientist
and I guess I exceed that there is
politics in all of life.

"I think that very often thereare
not honest differences of opinion.
There are some people who think a
person is a very valuable individual
for the University and therefore
ought to be retained and given
tenure. There are others who very
honestly, just as honestly. come to
‘the opposite opinion that this
person may have merit but that we
probably could do much better if

Van Beck Hall, former president
Pitt Professional Union(PPU)

we had another opportunity.

“In that sense there come to be
struggles betwen those who sup-
portta particular individual and
those who do not. Sometimes it’s
the department vs the dean. Some-
times there can be racial overtones
to it. Sometimes there-can be the
sexist problem. There can be
charges I should say that sexism’
came into it in some way. Generally
speaking, I really don’t think these
kinds of political claims have much
validity. I think we are all trying to
do just as responsible and profes-
sional a job as we can.”

The dangers in a situation like
this, according to Richman, in
which personalities play a role in
the conferral of tenure, could have
serious consequences for the future
of the university. “A subjective
judgment will favor perhaps a" less
competent and more agreeable
faculty member,” he said. “If the
administration has a choice be-
tween two faculty members for
tenure, the administration is more
likely to choose the one they like
better.” ' I

SUBJECTIVE APPLICATION OF
CRITERIA

ling. ac-ans. though, to yet another
serious problem relative to the‘
application of the criteria. accord-
ing to Hall. The subjectivity allows
administrators to deny tenure to
faculty who have succeeded in
meeting the criteria for tenure and
“A faculty member
may meet the criteria of the
department and is denied tenure
not on the basis of any procedural
ground," said Hall. “but on the
basis the dean wants to reallocate
faculty resources in his area or he is
trying to save money or for a series
of other factors ofthis type."

There are “non-quality consider-
ations"~ for -tenure conferral, Ro-
senberg admits, with ' the result-

   

 

   

that a faculty member who had met
the‘_criteria for promotion maystill
not be tenured.

“For example, said Rosenberg,
“if I see that a department is losing
student clientele, which would
mean reducing its faculty size and
that it should not confer tenure on
additional people and perhaps even
face the possibility of having to

9!

~ reduce the current staff. This is the
kind of consideration that is impor- '

‘tant but not even related to the
quality of the individual.

“We may have a department that
is well supplied with an excellent
staff and we just cannot make the
long term commitment for another
tenured faculty member. I may
reject a candidate because I may be
concerned with the prospects of
growth in the department and the

impact the decision has in the

I possible flexibility of the depart-

ment in later years.”-

When the foreign language re-
quirement was abandoned several
years ago, Pitt could not afford any
increase in tenured faculty in the
language ,departments, cited Ro-
senberg as an example of the effect
of departmental growth on tenure
conferrals.

This is not a valid reason for a
non-conferral of tenure argues

Hall. “I think there are other ways’

for the University to reallocate
teaching personnel. You’re dealing
with people who have been here
five or six years, and I feel that if
they have met the criteria then they
should be awarded tenure.”

Richman responds more bluntly to
these “non-quality considerations”
and suggests the University release
administrators instead of faculty.
“The University has a super abun-
dance of administrators .and there
is no evidence they are productive.
Most of the administrators at this
University are not doing their job.
There are too many superfluous
administrators and programs for
the University to claim not tohave
money for learning programs and
tenured faculty."

Smith. however. maintains the

changing job market is responsible '

for the facultycomplaints with the’
tenure process. According to Smith
there is more competition for
tenured positions since more qual-
ity faculty are available.

“There are good people out there
seeking jobs and a few years ago
those people were fiercely compet-
ing for and the chances were that if
you had a good average person you
might do worse if you let ‘him go
and‘ went out to try and get
someone else.- So, I think what has
happened is that people got used to

thinking-that if_l really; work hardy:
andgdo my. very. best; the chances-".-

 

\i'éci}iesd;1§‘,“>.-in-énibér 20-,

are 99-1 that I will get tenure. And
now we’re having to move into a
period when the chances may be
only 50-50 even though the person
may have done adequately.”

The Pitt administration considers
as a matter of policy that an
individual should only be tenured if
he isthe best available person in
his field. I L

This is an unrealistic criteria,
according to Richman, and allows
the administration to abuse the
tenure process. “This criteria per-
mits an assertion without any proof
that somebody - more qualiﬁed is
available. We at AAUP say if
somebody is available elsewhere--
has he been interviewed, and is he
willing to serve?

“We _don’t object to the idea that

the University should grant tenure‘

to only the best qualified person
available, but if this criteria is used
it cannot be used generally. If they
say there are better people avail-
able, we. want some names of
people who really are available. It's
like saying to an economist--there
are better people available---like
Paul Samuelson at MIT, the Nobel
Prize winners‘-well, it’s just ridicu-
lous.” .

Pitt is always searching for and

I has succeeded in hiring some of the
best faculty in their fields, said-

Rosenberg. , “We have brought
very competent, excellent people
into the junior faculty, who are
strongly rated for people starting in
their discipline. I am very proud to
see some of j the appointments
we’ve made.

“We don’t put up artiﬁcial ex-
pectations for our faculty,” adds
Rosenberg. “We don’t expect ev-
erybody to be a Nobel Prize winner.
What we expect from our people is
to be a conscientious academic
person.” .

Many faculty, however, are. more
concerned with the FAS Dean’s
policy of referring all tenure cases
approved at the departmental level
to anonymous ad hoc committees.
The committees which he appoints
reevaluate" the tenure candidate
and make a recommendation to
Rosenberg. If the committee re-
commends the conferral of tenure
Rosenberg says he will not reject
the candidate for promotion.

These committees were created,
according to Rosenberg, in order to
share the responsibility of evalua-
ting a candidate's qualiﬁcations.

the other extreme,” he said. “The
ad hoc committee makes a decision

without understanding who the
people are and how they fit into the
mission of the department.

“The decision is put in the hands
of those who do not know the disci-
pline, the person, or the depart-
ment, who are told to look at a
folder of the person to make a
second decision which is supposed
to be a better decision because they
think the department's decision is a
parochial decision.”

Hall agrees the department is the
best source ofjudgment in tenure
conferrals. “I think the basic
professional decision has to be
made by the department because
there is nobody else to make that
decision. You have to have some
type of close analysis of the
professional capabilities of tenure
candidates and I have the feeling
this can only be done at the
department level.”

But, one untenured faculty mem-
beriput it more bluntly. “The

}members of the ad hoc committees
are chosen from a very small group
of senior faculty. The decision,
though, is really Rosenberg’s, but
he uses the committees to give him
a little more weight. And very
often they have no competence to
judge a candidate’s qualifica-
tions.”

process. “The ad hoc committee

served to develop and improve the
quality of the institution." \

However, the FAS Dean is openly
irritated when it is suggested only
the department is capable of judg-
ing a candidate’s qualifcations.
“Departments have known in the
twentieth century that a depart-
ment recommendation still has to
be review by the administrators.
Departments know the dean is
going to review tenure cases very
seriously." .

Most faculty would not object to
the ad hoc process, according to
Riehman, if they could be assured
they would be guaranteed due
process. in the course of their
evaluation. “We would like the
specific charges or the specific
reasons for these committee’s
judgments to be exposed and the
opportunity presented to the in-
dividual to rebut and we think
when a rebuttal ismade it should
go back to that committee for
reconsideration.”

Rosenberg. however, maintains
the process is a fair one, and
objects to some faculty’s preoc-
cupation with due process consi-
derations. “A faculty member is

entitled to know the basis on which
he was not recommended for
tenure." he said. = “And if he
thinks information was not avail-
able to the committee he may ask
for reconsideration. And if there
are new facts in the case he may
ask for reconsideration. If he
thinks he was denied promotion for
reasons that turn out to be in his
judgment in violation of academic
freedom he may appeal his tenure
case. *
“Tenure is not a legal proceed-
ing,/" adds Rosenberg. “The
University very frankly hires peo-

‘ pie for a determined length and it

decides if it would be advantageous
to the overall goal of the University
to offer that person a long term
contract and a permanent posi-

tion."

Faculty concern for due process in
tenure cases ignores the reality
that it is the administration’s
prerogative to either accept or
reject a faculty’s ‘tenure, said
Smith. And he adds this is the
source of the controversy over the
tenure procedures.

“There are a lot of people who
feel that they ought to get tenure
unless some kind of set of charges
can be brought against them and

if made to stick. And there are those

who like myself agree that tenure is
not a right until it is conferred and
that the administration has a right

sity. I think that is were the big
issue is.

The hot debate over the tenure
process will continue. But. the
principle of tenure. now a subject
of litigation in the courts. is also
being questioned by many at Pitt.
Both Riehman and Hall, however
defend tenure as being absolutely
necessary for the well being of the
faculty.

“Quite frankly, we’re not making
princely salaries,” Hall comment-
ed. “The faculty are really very
similar to civil servants. For
practically a century civil servants
have had this type of tenure. I
think it’s pretty foolish not to have
tenure.” ~

Riehman adds. “Tenure is the
protection of a faculty member's

dismissal. That't all it is. Tenure
is essential.”

There is a need at Pitt to protect
the faculty's academic freedom.
according to Moye, but the Vice
Chancellor makes no secret of his
distaste for the tenure system. “I
don't like the tenure system. I
like to think that in a
reasonable system a good em-
ployee need not_ be protected by
that thing /called tenure."

While not objecting to the exist-

I ence of the tenure system‘Marshall -

questions whether tenure is a
viable principle any longer in light
of the economic problems affecting
all institutions of higher learning.
“We have to take a hard look at the
principle of tenure,” Marshall
said. “The sizes of schools are at

Pittsburgh   Theatre Curtain Rising Cumin I‘

Scheduled for Ployh

Iowo Lab Floats
To Pittsburgh On

99¢ Theatre

BY HARRIS LEVY

"The Iowa Theatre Lab is the next
company that we're bringing in.
They're going to be at Stephen
Foster on November 29th and 30th
and December 1, 2. and 3. People
who want tickets should get them
soon--the nature of the work re-
stricts the audience to 29 for each
performance of Dancer Without
Arms. Dr. Richard Mennenga Pitt
theatre arts faculty member.-.op—
timistically explains the plans of
the Pittsburgh Ninety-nine Cent
Floating Theatre Festival.

“The Lab appeared at. the Nancy
Festival in France and later played
in Paris. They're going to be in
New York and Baltimore before
they stop here on their way back to
Iowa." Mennen shuffles through
the papers on his desk until he
finds some reviews of the Iowa
Theatre Lab and a brochure elab-
orating their philosophy. --

The Iowa Theater Lab writes that

T “it seeks bold precise forms to
communicate its choices to am

audience, rejecting that which is
indeterminate, formless, lacking in
'energy...the Lab’s conviction is
that Americans, as actors and
audience, lose _touch with them-
selves if they resist exploring the
submerged dark continent which,
personally and communally, they

I - inherit.’ ’

Dancer Without Arms — “it’s
main theme is negative sexuality
—-frustrated or misplaced desire,
guilt. isolation, violence, longing

, for contact turned up past pleasure

to pain.“ So wrote Michael Smith
in a Village Voice article in which
he praised the Lab for its “finesse"
and “disciplind intensity." A Le
Monde critic lauded the perfor-
mance of another Lab production
for being "beautiful, talented,
seductive.’

Tickets are available at the Ste-
phen Foster Memorial box office
which is open from 1 to 5 pm and
can be reached at 624-4101. Men-
nen notes that tickets must be
picked up by the 23rd."

The Iowa Theatre “seeks bold, precise forms to communicate its ,
choices...rejecting that which is indeterminate, formless, lacking in

energy...”

Ninety-nine cents is all it costs to
see Dancer Without Arms. “The 99
cents has arisen to meed a need for
performances free from the expec-
tations enforced by a high-priced
ticket, free from the buy-and-sell
mind set...The 99 Cents is a
floating theatre, because people
will give’ the their performing
places when they are available, and
we will match the availability of
performers with the availability of
space." .

“The statement on the program
gave the principles of the 99 cent
theatre,” Dr. Mennen explains.
“I’m enthused about the project
because there’s little or no oppor-
tunity to see new theatre. Occa-
sionally there’s some in the univer-
sities but there are no chances to

see professional groups. The"

choices will be made in terms of the
groups that exist. Companies that
will play for 99 cents are mainly
younger groups that do new

see Medicine Show and Frogs,

performed at Trees Hall on Nov-

pany brought here by the festival.
“I didn’t know how many people
would show up.. I was surprised -- I
didn't think there were that many
people in the community who
wanted to try new theatre. We had
180 on Saturday and even Sunday's
performance, with little publicity,
attracted 90 people. There was a
fantastic mixture in the audience..

Commissioner Hunt, grandmothers I

and little kids. We had people of all
creeds, colors,’ and ages which
made the company very happy.
They said it was the best audience
they‘d had on their tour. In New

Theatregoers were delighted and
surprised by the performances of

J :,‘~‘$;..l’-_‘21sZt.ve1'y and Large Volume

BY M. C. PILECKI
;'iT\cloesn't take long to realize
wvhy The Hireling. a Cannes
Festival prize winner, had a
difl'icult~ start at the box office.

The 1973 release is a very quiet,
understated film, the type that’s
capsulized as “sensitive." Hardly
your moneybags blockbuster.
There’s no sex, no violence, and
really none of the things the TV-fed
American movie audience is used
to on a screen. A

Plus, more than coincidentally
inspired by the storyline itself, the
movie seems to have that "elite"
look that scares off the masses. The
same sort of actual or near-snob-

jhness afflicting the so-called
“art" market.

But The Hireling, far from being a
great or even important cinematic
statement, is rather flawed, al-
though still strong enough to
sustain one’s interest.

The story concerns the still young
Lady Helen Franklin, just recover-

’ ing from a nervous breakdown after

the death of her husband, an
influential member of Parliament.
While she tries’to put her life back
together in Britain of the 1930’s,
she frequently hires a car for her
needs and talks out her loneliness
with the driver. \
f"i;;.doing so, and in discarding
‘some of the “traditional" taboos
about familiarity with servants, she
'adopts such innocent habits as
sitting beside him (instead of in the
back seat) in the car and inquiring
of his family. Tragically enough,
the driver misconstrues her naive
friendliness and frequent odd
moods and, predictably but under-
fa-§;,(_i_ab1y, falls in love with her.

" 'i"'~1*he film has several things going

for it, two of which are stellar
performances by the two leads,
Sarah Miles and Robert Shaw.
Miles is the epitome of fragile
English aristocracy, almost deathly
pale coming from the sanltarium

the film, which gains color along
with the heroine] yet ever dignified
and beautiful, even in frailty.

Shaw, on the other hand, is a
hard-working lower class business-
man quite mindful of his place, and
quite obviously common. Every
syllable, every gesture, even the
way he walks marks his place in
society as surely as in a strict caste
system. But his emotions, growing
t_hroughout the movie, are real,
even though perhaps in a “com-
mon” way.

The Hireling shifts its point of
view gradually from Mi’lady,
seemingly an outcast even in her
own family at first, to the driver, a
true outcast from all friends by the
end. But the flaw is that the
transformation is rather uneven in
making Helen a sort of villainess in
the old decadent upper classes
division, a type of high class tramp.

It doesn’t gel. in

The Lady is too much the
bewildered child when she is forced
to turn to a hired hand for the
communication she so desperately
lacked elsewhere. For his part, the
driver just sits uncomfortably and,
when asked to reciprocate in a
small way, he lies and misleads the

Lady in hopes of placating a,

potentially good client. And as

Helen’s mental health improves,
she tries -- in a somewhat
acceptable, aristocratic way -- to
help out the driver when he seems
to need it. But she, of course,
cannot return a love she does not
mean to provoke.

After being a gentle soul helping

first the driver then an ambitious.

potential husband-in his political
career (he hopes -to follow in her
late footsteps in more ways than
one), who also turns out to be

deceitful, Lady Helen is suddenly'

changed into a cold aristocratic

tramp unable to feel love or
concern.
But other than the rather

unbelievable tumabout at the end,
The Hireling is a quite engrossing
movie, with many of the “little
touches” that make quiet little
films like this interesting. The
characters, even the minor ones,
are ﬁnely drawn and expertly
portrayed. The photography cap-
tures an ethereal beauty in the
English countryside and the small,
dirty towns that form a backdrop
for the action.

The Hireling is a rather interes-
ting, if non-blockbuster ﬂick, and is
the type to attract the arty crowd
rather than a mass audience, which
is what it’s been doing.

But there are endless puns and
inversions of popular expressions
which can be funny at times.

The film is almost entirely
derivative. It parodies the whole
spectrum of the science fiction
genre, from old Flash Gordon and
Buck Rogers serials to "2001. One
sequence is a direct rip-off from
King Kong.

There are Disney-like shots of
fairyland kingdoms and some
beautiful animated sequences of
constellations in motion. These
scenes of pure fantasy are very
nice, but they are also taken from
earlier sources.

Comic book titles flash across the
screen. The film incorporates the
simplistic morality of melodrama
and the grotesquerie of the
carnival.

tion, but that is as it should be in a
film like this.

can’t get in unless you’re over 17.

becoming a cult item in the same

P/Adams Expecting Improvement

BY JAN MATTHEWS"
Starting December 2 against the
second best wrestling team in the
country, Michigan, Coach Dave

' Adam's Pitt wrestlers will try to

improve on a dismal 5-12 record.‘
Back from last year’s squad are

George Bryant and Rande Stottle-

meyer, both All-Americans, and

" A Ron Selfridge, third in last year’s
.» Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling
. . Association tournament.

Pitt no
longer will have the services of
Wally Morrell, a senior last year,
who compiled an 11-11 individual
record in the 167 pound class.

To replace Morrell and to ﬁll any
other gaps left open, Adams went
on a recruiting binge bringing in no
less than seven freshmen, and
Adams says that as many as three
of them have an opportunity to ﬁnd
themselves in the starting line-up.

Adams is not blessed with schol-

arships to hand out. He is forced to
draw from a fund to recruit
members of his team. This aspect
only gives Adams a chance to
“recruit where we need more
strength.”

Pitt still has a young team, and a
rock hard schedule awaits them.

“Our schedule is very tough,”
says Adams. “In addition to
Michigan,
powerhouses as Navy,
Clarion, and Penn State.”

Terrapins junior varsity football
team comes to Pitt Stadium on
Friday to play the Pitt JV squad in a
noon match. Both Pitt and Mary-
land are in the process of rebuild-
ing their football programs, and the

game should be an exciting con-‘

Pitt has victimized Potomac State,
Kent State, Youngstown, and Alle-
gheny Community so far this year,

and the Panthers have looked_

impressive in all four games.
Many of the players on this years
Cub squad will play varsity ball
next year, and the importance of a
JV team in keeping a winning
tradition alive is crucial.

“They are a real good, solid group

John Richardson, Walt Brown, and
Jim Buoy, all freshmen, comprise
the front line for the Panthers.
When you start looking for reasons
why the team has been able to
amass a total of 26 ﬁrst downs per
game on the average, the offensive
line is one of the prime reasons.

Of course, the backfield and
receiving corps has something to
do with it as well. Tom Sindewald
leads the team in rushing yardage
with 249 yards in 55 attempts and
two touchdowns. Tailback Ed
Brosky has" picked up 132 yards in
38 carries, and wingback Calvin
Glover, a walk on, has rushed for
35 yards in 6 tries.

Matt Cavanaugh and Bernardo,

Paez have both played quarter-
back, though Cavanaugh has
played a great deal more, and the
two -have together completed 65
percent of their pass attempts. Tim
Padovese_ occupies the tight end
position, grabbing eight passes for

Taylor has caught 25 passes for 439

As a unit, the offense has gained
1454 yards in total offense, 707 of
those rushing. They have gained
105 first downs compared to just 29
for their opponents. That, in itself,
is an incredible statistic. I '

The defense, as can be summar-
ized from the fact that they have
only yielded 29. first downs in four
games, has, been rugged. Paul
Test, Ed Ford, Steve Pritchard,
John Richardson, and Gary Tyra
constitute the‘ front ﬁve; the mon-
sterman is Dave DiCiccio; Tom

.Rechichar and Kurt Kovack the

linebackers; Bill Paken, Willie
Marsh, and Eugene Conngrs the
defensive secondary. The’ defen-
sive unit has allowed only 789 yards
to be ground out against them this
year, have intercepted nine passes,
and recovered 13 fumbles. Re-
markably, only one touchdown pass
has been thrown, against the Pan-

ther defense all year.

Ice Trip Unsuccessful  

BY STEVE SYBERT

The Pitt Hockey Club was ﬂying
high after a hard-fought 2-2 tie with
Villanova on Saturday only to be
‘shot down the following day by the
Navy Midshipmen.

The Panthers had to come from
behind twice in order to deadlock
the Wildcats, but could not quite
catch up to Navy after spotting
them a 3-0 first period lead.

Denny Brown knotted the Villano-
va game at the 9:30 mark of the
ﬁnal 15-minute period by ramming
home a 15-footer after taking the
face-off from center Charlie Ha-
gins. .

Until Rick Martin [not the one
from Buffalo] scored an unassisted
goal with 7:26 gone in the second
period, the contest was marred by
numerous slashes, elbows, and
charges which by game’s end
amounted to an abounding 31
penalties. Martin picked up a loose

puck which, after being. driven‘

 

wide by Pitt's Rick Vernon,
caromed all the way from behind
the Villanova net to the Pitt
blue-line from where the Wildcat
center skated in all alone to beat
Panther goalie John DeFazio.

Pitt tied the game for the first
time two minutes later when
Vernon ﬁred another blistering
shot which this time soared by
Villanova’s “Bunk” Barnard and
into the net. Bob Arturo and
Browne were responsible for
setting up the scoring play.

The Wildcats’ Bob Scarfone,
assisted by Walt Lucca, put his
team back on top by powering a
shot into the cage at 8:55 of the
ﬁnal period only to see Pitt's left
winger Browne tie it up lessthan a
minute later.

Both teams failed on excellent
scoring opportunities in the game’s
closing minutes. Barnard stopped a
blazing shot by Vernon with two

In just a few years the Terrapins

the Atlantic Coast Conference,
while Pitt has become the best in

Johnny Majors. For the trend to
continue, the JV teams will have to

continue supplying the varsity wi.%

good players each year. '

- “The JV team is deﬁnitely‘ a

stepping stone to varsity play in
most cases,” Leahy explained.
“What we’re trying to do with the
JV program at Pitt is to develop a V
winning attitude, which. hopefully
will help our overall program.”
Life on the JV team isn’t always
easy, because everyone wants to

play varsity, and also because thy «.

JV’s have to run against the ﬁrs 

team varsity in practice every day.
And they run the plays» against
guys like Burley. Moorhead,

even the toughest players in the

“They are really an important
part of our program." Leahy noted.

“They have worked very hard
running the plays of the scout
squad. It's good that they get a
chance to play a team like Mary-

minutes remaining and thus stifled
Pitt’s hopes of coming out with a
win. Villanova’s Scott Heitmann,
trying to hit the upper left-hand
corner, fired a ten-footer wide of
the goal as time was running out.

The second period was highlight-
ed by flared tempers on the part of
both teams. The Panthers’ Arturo
was about to be sent off for an
interference penalty at 6:46 when
Villanova’s Scarfone cracked him in
the ribs with the blade of his stick.
This led to much pushing and

. ;.r?"'f.iw.ing with Hagins and Bill Duffy

of Villanova each receiving double
minor penalties for roughing.
Scarforie was dealt a major for
spearing with intent to injure.
Browne and Martin were called
for roughing three minutes later,
but the headliner came at 13:06
betwen Russ Stump of Pitt and
Villanova’s Jeff Fick who were both
sentenced to sit out the remainder

of the game with fighting majors.

The Panthers got off to a sluggish
start in Annapolis, allowing the
Midshipmen to take an early lead
which Pitt failed to overcome. Jack
Shaughnessy opened the scoring at
the 4:26 mark for the Middies by
blasting a slap shot by DeFazio
from ten feet out. Scott Moore
followed with another only 25
seconds later to give Navy an early
2-0 margin. Bill Dooley assisted on
both goals while Norm Meiss
helped out on. the initial tally.

The Panthers’ attack picked up
towards the end of period one but
they failed to get on the scoreboard
despite several good chances. In
one instance, Vernon broke in all
alonelon Navy goalie Jim Hanna
but the puck slid off his stick and by
the net.

While Pitt was still applying the
pressure, the Middies scored what
turned out to be the winning goal
on a close play in front of the
Panther net. Dave Niedermaier

“I had a great game against Penn
State last year,” he stated boldly.
“Where I came from, we didn’t
hear too much about Penn State, So
I wasn’t over-psyched for the
game.”

But perhaps the ()’3’', 255 pound
senior has been drooled over most
by head’ coach Johnny Majors.
Earlier in the season. Majors let a
group of reporters know how he felt
about his strongman.

“He's a legitimate candidate for
the Outland Trophy as the best
lineman in the country. I-le‘s as
good as Rich Glover was at
Nebraska and as quick and strong
as Lu Selmon was at Oklahoma.
He's the finest lineman l‘ve ever
been around as a coach."

_Those are strong words indeed,
even for a head coach, but there’s
much reason to believe Majors. He
saw both those Big Eight stars

M develop and perform while coach-

ing at another Big 8 school, Iowa
State.

Burley himself modestly shrugs
off such gooey praise (“I don't
gloat over things like that”), and
instead concentrates on his upcom-
ing battle with the “Number One in
the East" Nittany Lions.

Was Burley upset about not being
able to enter a bowl game this
year?

“No, not at all. In fact, before the
Notre Dame the seniors voted not
to go to the Liberty Bowl because it
would look like we were a last

resort. Besides, the PSU game is as
big as a bowl game, as far as
money and prestige.” .

So, in fact, the Panthers would not
have accepted a bid from Memphis
even had they defeated Notre
Dame.

' Now all that’s left for Burley are

the Penn State encounter and the
countless All-Star games he's likely

Iowa Theatre: Presentation of America   

(Contirzued from Page 9)

Medicine Show is an exuberant
entertainment which mines [and
'undermines]-a rich lode of Ameri-
can archetypes; it combines the
energy of Marat/SADE with the
parody of Mad Dog Blues.
Besides characters like a slow-
witted cowboy, an Indian maiden,
and a tough-talking soldier, the
Medicine Show cast enacts ver-
sions of the George Washington
legends, the Wizard of Oz tale, and
a gangster story. After setting up
the characters and the plots, the
show cleverly weaves them toge-
ther; the facades of the stereotypes
are destroyed while they’re all
shown to be part of the same set of
values, the American bedrock.
Medicine Show exposes the false-
ness of notions such as “money can
buy happiness.”
The inventive, unorthodox pre-
sentation complements the origin-
ality of the play. The company

Pig, the council has combined: matches the different plots with

engrossing drama with a subtly
delivered and relevant recreation of
the life of a black family in the

appropriate acting styles.
Whether they’re drifting in and

‘out of several roles or hawking

Animal Crackers and other goods

while mingling with the crowd at
intermission, the Medicine Show
Theatre Ensemble keeps the audi-
ence constantly dazzled, amused,
and attentive. And by juxtaposing

the plots to demonstrate that the’

American myths can't really help
reach anyone (the Wizard can just
do card tricks and throw pies),

Medicine Show leaves theatregoers '

with a lot to think about. The
performances at Trees Hall were an
auspicious beginning for the 99
Cent Festival.

The Medicine Show Theatre En-
semble and the Iowa Theatre Lab
are the first of “possibly a half
dozen groups by the spring”
brought to Pittsburgh through the
efforts of the 99 Cent Festival.

as long as the money holds out and
the companies can make it.”

“IdeaIly, we’d like to have a
group in summer residency to hold
workshops. There’s a precedent for
the 99 cent Floating Theatre Festi-
val: the Theatre Project in Balti-
more and we’re in touch with them.
They put on productions every
weekend without charging admis-
sion...Baltimore’s closer to New
York where most of the companies
are. The International Theatre
Institute is going to feature the 99
Cent Festival and the Baltimore
group and others in their newslet-
ter which goes out to 3500 groups...
maybe in the ‘future there’ll be a
whole circuit that companies can
play regularly.”

The 99 Cent Theatre, a welcome
development in local theatre, _ is

sure to provide many exciting and
unusual evenings for Pittsburgh
audiences.

Replying to a ﬁnal question, Dr.
Mennen states that he is the
founder and executive director of
the Pittsburgh 99 Cent Floating
Theatre Festival. “I’m ‘more like
the chief balloonist,” he adds with
a sinile, “if that doesn’t just sound
like hot air.”
