The Cathedral of Learning was the
home of the Fortune 500 Forum’s open-
ing _ dinner held on Thursday evening.
The dinner included a pageant celebrat-
ing Pittsburgh’s ethnic diversity in
which over 60 different nationalities
were represented. A v

The Fortune 500 Forum is made up
of more than 100 top business leaders in
the nation. The group held its eighth
annual conference this weekend in
Pittsburgh. ‘

According to Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg, this dinner was the only
large group meeting of the_Forum.

“To have it [dinner] ‘here in the
Cathedral, the Commons Room in par-
ticular, [was] to expose some important
people from all around the country to
the University,” he said. ‘ ,

Before the dinner, the Forum trav-
eled to the Carnegie Museum, where
Pittsburgh . historian Nathan
McCol1ough delivered a lecture.

For three days, the CEOs, presi-

dents and chairmen of businesses
focused on issues facing'today’s compa-
nies, including market volatility, global
competition, the information technology
revolution, and the state educational
system. ‘ - 9

This year the theme of the»confer- L

ence was “New Ideas for Leadership.”
According _to John Needham, president
of Fartune’s conference division, the
agenda explored the key issues that
American businesses will faceas they
go into the 21st century.

“The Forum brings together
America’s business leaders to stimulate
new thinking on key issues facing com-
panies in this uncertain economic cli-
mate,” he said. . .

Members of Pitt’s Students in
Solidarity said they _missed a good
opportunity to let top CEOs know of
their unhappiness with workers’ wages
in the United States.

But despite learning of the event at
the last minute, they managed to put
together a barmer in 10 minutes. '

Black gays deal wit
Iifecis double minorities

’ Christal Hall

Staff Writer

When Ritch, a Pitt senior, was 16,
he had a secret so electrifying that the
idea of someone finding out made his
heart race.

He found the courage to tell his
mother that very secret and instead of
comforting him, she yelled, “You’re
going to go to hell for that.”

That’s the coming-out story of
Ritch. He said he hid his homosexu-
ality from his family because he
thought it was something bad and he
didn’t want anyone to find out about
it.

Now that he’s 21 years old, his
relationship with his mother has
improved. He said he’s a happier man
because he’s_completely honest with

7 CVCIYOIIC.

“It was difficult growing up gay
because the pressures of society were
mounting up on me,” said Rich, who
did not wish to give his last name.

But if being a homosexual makes
Rich a minority, then he can be con-

sidered a double minority because_

he’s black as well.

As part of National Coming Out

Week, the Rainbow Alliance, in con-
junction with the Black Action
Society, held an open forum on race
and sexuality last Tuesday.

It was held as an attempt to dis-
cuss the many issues that gay minori-
ties face and to also dispel any stereo-
types —— such as all gay men are fem-

L inine — that society may have about

people of alternative lifestyles.

“There are so many issues that
face queers. You don’t stop to think
about racial issues,” said Ray
Murphy, co-president of the Rainbow
Alliance.

Kynetta McFarlane, BAS’ com-
munity outreach chair, said that some-
times people don’t think about what
they are saying and fail to realize the

McCullough said his restaurant

are sitting with some who is under-
age. He added this has always been
one of its policies, and it hasn’t
changed. ‘

“The restaurant ultimately faces

Beale said, whose restaurant will
not serve people over,21 seated with
those who are underage.

effects of their words on other peo-
ple’s feelings.

Black men have a tendency to be
insecure about their sexuality, said
Mykol Walters, BAS’s intercollegiate
struggle chair. '

“For a lot of black men, they feel
emasculated already, and they feel

like they are in competition with gay .

males,” McFarlane added.

She added that a lot of racism is
inbred, but sometimes people maydo
it subconsciously.

The audience members were from
different ethnic and educational back-
grounds, ranging from undergraduate
to doctoral students.

“Being a gay man of Hispanic ori-

gins, I feel I have an imperative to
work on gay issues,” said Michael
Mazza, a Ph.D student. “There’s a
prejudice against homosexuals.”

Marques McKnight, BAS’ politi-
cal action chair said, Pittsburgh is one
of the most racist cities for a young
black man to begin his life.

“The more African-American gay
males come out, the more willfollow
suit,” McKnight said.

McFarlane added that sometimes
it’s dangerous being gay, and it’s even
more detrimental being gay and
black.

“It’s a phenomenon for people to
accept themselves and to be proud of
who they are regardless of being gay,
white ‘or black,” said McFarlane.
“That in itself is enough to be proud

_ of.”

Pennsylvania Liquor code needs
some serious amendments

According to the
Pennsylvania Liquor Code, a
restaurant has the right to refuse
to serve an alcoholic beverage
to a patron over 21 if he or she
is accompanied by someone
who is underage. Though it is
not an enforced rule and it is at

the discretion of the restaurant’s .

owner, it is still an incredibly
stupid idea. '

Exceptions to the rule allow
restaurants to serve parents who
take their children to a restau-
rant and people who are at least
25 years old but are in a group
that includes younger people.
The rule is tailored to suit par-

ents and families (“family val-_

ues” is the phrase of choice for
those on the right wing with few
or no critical thinking skills),
but in reality, it is a step toward
Prohibition.

One can argue whether
under-21s should be allowed to
drink alcohol or not. But right
now, a person of legal drinking
age should be served alcohol
upon request in an establish-
ment with a liquor license, even
if he or she is accompanied by
someone under the age of 21.

How can ‘ ' the
Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania expect its resi-

dents to act responsibly if it
takes away the chance for them
to do so?

There are already laws in

' place stating that it is illegal to

serve alcohol to someone under
the age of 21, and that over-21s
may not- purchase alcohol for
minors. Why compound the
issue by adding more legislation
aimed at reducing underage
drinking? Aren’t the
Republicans in the state legisla-
ture against big government?
This doesn’t sound like the

reduction of the state’s role in,

its citizens affairs. .

It is not mandatory for
restaurants to enforce this law
(not yet’, anyway), and it doesn’t
rank nearly as high as other

~Pennsylvania drinking laws

such as the “Cops in Shops”
program, which places plain-
clothes officers in bars and
liquor stores to catch drinking
offenders. The only good thing
about this is that the
Pennsylvania Liquor Control

Board gave restaurants a choice.

It is still, however, a dis-
criminatory rule, and if any
restaurant owner values “little”

things such as civil liberties and _

rights, he or she will tell the
PLCB where to shove its code.

Justice delayed, justice denied 9

After weeks of solerrm injunctions from .
. mainstream commentators to the effect that we

must wage a “war on terrorism,” an event of
this past weekend was truly refreshing. The
arrest of Augusto Pinochet in London high-
lights the falsehood that lies at the heart of the
United States’ “war on terrorism”: namely,
that the United States is the innocent “victim”
of “terrorism,” completely benign in its own
intentions and incapable of itself inﬂicting
monstrous horrors on the world.

For those who aren’t familiar with it, let’s
go over the relevant history. In 1970, Salvador
Allende of the Socialist Party was elected
president of Chile. Chile — in contrast to most

La1:inAmerican countries — had a long-estab- ‘\

lished democratic tradition, and Allende’s
“ arliamentary road” to socialism held out the
prospect of meaningful change.

This did not sit well with the heads of
transnational corporations like
International Telephone and
Telegraph, nor with top policy
planners in the U.S. government,
who feared that Chile would set an
example for the parliamentary left
in countries like Italy. The United States set
out to destabilize the democratically elected
government by ,“making the economy

scream” and by  CIA assistance to mili-

tary coup plotters. . A

~ When Chilean army Gen. Rene Schneider
upheld the principle of army neutrality in pol-
itics, the CIA -ﬁrnded a fascist terrorist group

called Patria y Libertad, which promptly

assassinated Schneider, making way for the
right—wing elements led by Gen. Augusto
Pinochet. On Sept. 11, 1973, the military
struck, bombing the presidential palace in
Santiago and killing Allende. The military
then unleashed a '17-year reignof terror in
which at least 3,000 people were murdered or
“disappeared,” and in which thousands of oth-
ers were horriﬁcally tortured. The new mili-
tary regime invited experts from ﬂie “Chicago

school” of economics to oversee mass priva1i- '

zations and union-busting; the latter’s “liber-
tarian” sensibilities were not offended by the
hundreds of dead bodies piled up by Pinochet.

The United States’ excuse for initiating
the overthrow of a democratic government
and replacing. it with a military regime that

   

systematically practiced torture? In the words
of then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger: “I
don’t see why we have to let a country go
Marxist just because its people are irresponsi-
ble.”

In 1990, facing a growing wave of revul-
sion within Chile against his autocratic rule,
Pinochet agreed to a form of democratic elec-
tions, but on his own terms. The new constitu-
tion granted Pinochet immunity from prosecu-
tion in Chile for the crimes he committed dur-
ing his time, in office, and even after leaving
the presidency, he remained head of the armed

-forces.

However, in July of 1996, the Association
of Progressive Spanish Prosecutors ﬁled suit

in a Spanish court on behalf of the families of .

Spanish. citizens who had been killed by the
Chilean regime. This offered the possibility of
punishing Pinochet for his crimes on the basis
of international law even if Chilean
courts would not prosecute him
because international law forbids
amnesty forithose who perpetrate

COLUMMST crimes against humanity. . ,
Until now, however, the suit

seemed largely symbolic because upon step-
ping down as head of the military, Pinochet
assumed the title 0 “senator for life” — creat-
ed especially for him — and remained rela-
tively secure in that position, despite resent-
ment on the part of most of the Chilean popu-
lation. K A

Last weekend, however, as the ex-dictator
was visiting Britain for medical treatment, he
was arrested by the British authorities. As of

this writing, it remains to be seen whether the .

United Kingdom will honor Spanish requests
for extradition, but such a move is something
to hope for. I

That Pinochet might be held accountable

for the deaths of several Spanish citizens while i

avoiding oiﬁcial culpability for the thousands
of Chileans murdered by his regime is never-
theless a case of “too little too late.” Also dis-

appointing is the fact that Henry Kissinger will .

never be prosecuted as an accessory to murder,
but this will always be the case as long as
rogue states are permitted to harbor terrorists.

should be so concerned over what cer-
tain cults do. So what if some choose to
castrate themselves and wear purple
robes? So what if some choose to open-
ly defy the Federal Bureau of
Investigation and burn their own houses

down? So what if some say “Our
Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be
thy name”?

In response to Loornis’ concern
with growing competition from “evil”
cults (Hare Krishnas, International
Church of Christ, Microsoft) and the
threat they pose to “legitimate” cults
(Roman Catholicism), I have decided to
add to his headache. This afternoon, I,
along with nine male friends, will go to
the Office of Student Activities and reg-

" ister the Holy Church of Fulber as a stu-

dent organization. V _
Fulberism (catchy name, don’t you
think?) has something that most reli-
gions do not: a strong female deity.
Sure, Roman Catholicism has the
pagan-based Mother Mary (a psycholo-
gy professor of mine once explained
that her weak image contributed to the
position of woman as a second-class cit-
izen in medieval Europe), but
Fulberism has Asia Carrera. Though she
doesn’t yet know of her promotion from
porn star to deity,» she will serve as a
good female ﬁgurehead for our congre-

-— gation to worship. (Bring toilet paper to

prayer meetings. Our worshipping ses-
sions could get messy!)

As founder and self-appointed pope
of Fulberism, I will not carry out mind-
control techniques such as those used
by the Hare Krishnas (there has to be
some brainwashing going on there -— I

mean, who would voluntarily look that

bad?!). Potential Fu1berists_will be wel-
comed to our meetings with openarms.
For three hours, we will treat them to

the best of European techno music,‘

accompanied by stunning 3-D Visuals
and a subtle voice—over by Pope Fulber.
No brainwashing or mind control here!
Now,’ I know you’re thinking
Fulberism is not exactly a well—deﬁned
religion, but remember, the Church of
Scientology does not tell you every-
thing up front — it’d ruin-the surprise
and joy of being a Scientologist. Your

indoctrination into Fulberism will be a’ ,

slow yet enjoyable‘ process. And relax:
You won’t have to shave off all your

. pubic hair until your sixth month of

membership.

Does the Holy Church of Fulber
sound good to you? Would you like to
send us a contribution? Do anal beads
strike the fun chord much more than
rosary beads? Ronald Loornis might
have something to say about Fulberism
(needless to say, it’ll all be right—wing

gumbo) at his next campus visit, but.

remember, whatever he’s going to say
about us is false, just as his comments
on the ICC and Hare Krishnas are false.

Cults aren’t bad; they’re merely

misunderstood. Come on and join my « I

God, my Tribe, my Church, my Cult.

.1 Pitt Panthers
have two faces

Many boos rang throughout Pitt
Stadium at the end of Saturday’s game.
This sound of disapproval came
from a crowd very frustrated with a

team that seems to change faces in’

every game it plays. The loss to
Rutgers was no exception. ,

* Pitt was supposed to win. Coach
Walt Harris seemed to agree, stating
there are no excuses for what hap-
pened out on the field.

“We saw four different teams out
there today, two of ours and two of
theirs,” he said.

This has been the case all season.
The Panthers seem to suffer from some
kind of football multiple-personality
disorder. Each week, fans see a_differ-
ent team taking the field.

In this week’s matchup, it was a
difference of halves for the Panthers.
In the first half, they played a tight
defense and even shook up the offense
with more running plays than in previ-

. ous weeks. However, the team was

dramatically different after halftime.
The nationally ranked defense faltered,

letting Rutgers drive the ball up the

field to whittle away the Panthers’ 21-
7 halftime lead.

Why did Pitt shut ~ down a both
offensively and defensively in the sec-

. ond half? Why did the face of a team

change so quickly in such a short peri-
od of time? ~ _ I
It has a lot to do with Pitt’s oppo-

nent. Recall last season if you will. Or’

even recall last year’s Pitt-Rutgers
contest. The Panthers came out with
the win only after a double-overtime
contest that shouldn’t have been the
nail-biter it was. How could a team
that beat Miami and Virginia Tech in
that. season lose to Temple and almost
lose to Rutgers?-

'The same question can be asked
this year, and there is a differentarray
of answers and excuses. This season’s
opening game was supposed to be an
easy win against Division. I-AA
Villanova, yet Pitt barely squeaked out
a-48-41 victory. But against Penn
State, the Panthers played solidly in
their, loss and showed a national TV
audience it could play with the best.

Even in the Virginia Tech game,

. though the offense struggled and the

ﬁnal score didn’t reﬂect it, the defense
showed the 10th-ranked Hokies they
were in the game.

Over the last two seasons, Pitt has
failed to win some of the games that
are supposed to be the easiest on the

At the half, everything seemed normal.
The Pitt Panthers’ nationally ranked
defense had allowed just 59 yards and no
points. Matt Lytle and the offense had dri-

ven for three touchdowns, overshadowing

an early fumble and giving Pitt a 21-7 lead.
The crowd cheered as the
Homecoming King and Queen celebrated.
But in the. third quarter, quarterback

, Mike McMahon and the Scarlet Knights of

Rutgers mined the happy Homecoming.
The sophomore sigiial-caller ﬁom nearby
Wexford, Pa, opened the period by leading
a Rutgers ﬁeld—goal drive, then threw two
touchdown passes to give his team a 22-21
edge. A late Scarlet Knight ﬁeld goalmade
the ﬁnal score 25-21, putting ‘the Panthers
(2-4, 0-2 Big East) one game behind
Rutgers (3-3, 1-3) in the conference stand-
mgs.

“We got outfought in the second half,”
said Pitt head coach Walt Hanis. “No
excuses.”

/ After being held to 35 yards in the air
for the ﬁrst half, McMahon opened_ the
third quarter by more than doubling his
output — connecting with Chris Hutton on
a 40-yard pass play. ‘

The drive stalled at the Pitt 22, but

Ike,.WiIliams took his place on the next _

tured Mitlireep Panther  backs.
Williams stayed in for the rest of the drive,
which ended six plays’ later without a score.
Harris would conﬁrm later that Barlow
re—aggravated an old ankle injury on the
play, putting almost half of Pitt’s offensive
production out for therest of the contest.
“You could tell that he wasn’t able to
go,” Harris said of Barlow, who missed all
of the Pitt—North Carolina game last week
with the same injury. Williams ﬁlled in for
Barlow the rest of the way on Saturday,
netting 46 of his 60 rushing yards in the

' second half.

After Ike and the Pitt offense debuted_
-in the second‘ half with a punt, McMahon
went on anotherlong drive, this one a 76-
yard march highlighted by a 20-yard com-
pletion to Hutton. Fifteen more yards were
tacked on to the reception when the Pitt
defense drilled McMahon after the com-
pletion, setting up a ﬁrst down at‘ the
Panther 15-yard line.

Five plays later, the McMahon—Hutton
connection clicked for ‘a 2—yard scoring

According to the pregame depth chart,
Kevan Barlow should have taken the ﬁeld

for Pitt’s ﬁrst offensive series on Saturday. .

Slated to start at tailback after missing
the North Carolina contest, Barlow
watched as Ike Williams lined up behind
Matt Lytle. I

- It was the ﬁrst of many running-back
switches made by head coach Walt Harris
in an attempt to ﬁnd a solid starting back

But despite the Panthers’ 237 yards
rushing in their 25-21 Homecoming loss to
Rutgers, that solid starter hasn’t material-

“We’re trying to ﬁnd someone that we
can ride,” Harris said, when asked about

the trio of backs — Ike Wﬂliams, Brandon '

Williams, and Barlow —— he used. “We’re
trying to ﬁnd out who is the best guy,- and
Ike hadn’t had much of a chance.”

Before his start, Ike Williams had a
total of ﬁve _can°ies for the Panthers. He’d
made an impression in August training
camp, taking wicked hits from Pitt defend-
ers during__the ﬁrst Johnstown scrimmage.

Saturday, Ike went back to basics —

cl oo r o pe n at
on his ﬁrst carry, Dax Strohmeyer spiked
him for a 1-yard loss. Ike ﬁnished the game
with 60 yards on the ground, eclipsed only
by Barlow’s 17-carry, 96-yard perfor-
mance. ‘

Barlow began his day on Pitt’s second
series, rushing up the middle for 5 yards,
then taking one of Pitt’s three option pitch-
es of the day for a 1-yard gain. On the next
series, the sophomore staked his claim for
Pitt’s starting job, beginning the drive with
a 44-yard carry off right tackle, Pitt’s

longest "run from scrimmage this season.

It also represented the end of Bar1ow’s
claim. He would end the Pitt drive by
knocking a pass into the arrris of Rutgers’
Jabari Moore, and on the ﬁrst play of Pitt’s
next drive, the nmning back ﬁimbled away
Pitt’s second option pitch. Reggie Stephens
batted the ball forward, then picked, it up
and raced for a 53-yard score.

_“We had a couple of crazy things hap-
pen,” Harris said. “We were a little
snakebit, looking back at it.” _

The snake ﬁnished oﬁ one of Pitt’s
three backs in the third quarter, when
Barlow re-injured his ankle and left the
contest. ~

averaged just over 4 yards per carry, and

Brandon touched the ball only once. The.

option resulted in only one important rush:
Late in the second quarter, Latef Grim took

touchdown. A

Perhaps even more surprising than
the 25-21 loss to Rutgers Saturday was
the spotty play of the Panthers’
defense.

Going into the game, Pitt was
ranked ninth nationally in total
defense and was certainly expected to
dominate the struggling Rutgers
offense, which had only scored three
touchdowns in a game one time this
year.

Instead, Rutgers took advantage of
poor defensive coverage in the second
half to open up its passing game, and it
ran the ball effectively to score 19
unanswered points and complete_its
comeback. ‘ -I
_ Pitt’s defense was able to live up
to its nationalranking during the first
 The_,._V only Rutgers score in the
 30 minutes came from its defense,
when Kevan Barlow’ mishandled a
pitch from Matt Lytle ..and Reggie
Stephens returned the ball down the
left sideline for a Rutgers’ touchdown.

Had the Panthers been able to
repeat their first half performance,

they would have -given up only 119

. total yards, bolstering their season sta-
‘ tistics. By, the game’s end,.however,

Rutgers had gained 324 yards.

In the final , minute of the third
quarter, McMahon threw over the
middle to receiver .Bill Powell, who
had the coverage beaten by three
steps. Powell ran to the left sideline
and into the end zone for a 62-yard
touchdown.

Perhaps the most disappointing
defensive effort came without a big
play. With three minutes gone in the
fourth and Rutgers holding a 22-21
lead, punter Greg DeBolt sent a high,
37-yard kick to the Rutgers 2-yard

line. In a spectacular play,‘ senior

Chuck Brown caught the punt, leaving
the Knights with terrible’ field posi-
tion.

Rutgers then began a steady 72-
yard drive that resulted in a field goal.

“The momentum changed,” head
coach Walt Harris said, after the con-
test. “The game was lost way before

then, but it made it so that it would be

very difficult to come back.”

schedule. This season, most of the
players suited up each gameday are
new to the Big East and the Panther
football program. So losses to teams
like Virginia Tech aren’t so heartbreak-
ing. However, losses like the one: on
Saturday are.

In order to become respected in the

Big Eastland in the nation, the Panthers

"not only have to take their game to

another level when playing tough
opponents, but they have to take the
same mentality into the games in

which they have the obvious advan- —

tage.

play. Phil Clarke blocked Barone’s extra-
point try, making the score 21-16.

It was Rutgers’ first offensive touch-
down of the game —— the team’s first score
came on Reggie Stephens’ 53-yard return
of a Barlow fumble.

“They got hope when they scored the
ﬁeld goal on the opening drive, and then
we kept‘ giving them more hope,” Harris
said. ' ‘ .

Stephens struck again midway

mom PAGE 8

L through the third, giving the Knights more

hope and, more importantly, giving them
the ball back. I

The Rutgers comerback leapt in front
of a Lytle pass intended for Latef Grim,
putting a weary Pitt defense back on the
ﬁeld to meet theistreaking McMahon-.

The sophomore didn’t disappoint On
the d1ive’s second play, he threw a bullet to
Bill Powell, who left Pitt defensive back
Tray Crayton in his wake on his way to the
go-ahead touchdown;

The 63-yard play was the longest
reception of PoweH’s career and the
longest pass of McMahon’s -career.'It was
also the longest scoring play from scrim-
mage against the Pitt defense this season.

“It was a bulldozer elfect in the second
half,” Crayton said. “We were just playing
sloppy.”

The two-point conversion failed,
keeping the score at 22-21 in favor of the
Knights. Lytle threw an 11-yard toss to
Terry Murphy on the ﬁrst play of the next
drive, but netted 6 yards on the next three
plays to force a punt and provoke a burst of
boos from the 31,176 Homecoming fans in
attendance as the third quarter ended.

McMahon ‘went 5 for 6 in the quarter,

. throwing for 139 yards and two touch-

downs.

The boos died down as Pitt quickly
stopped the Rutgers offense after three
plays. They rose up again as the Panthers
were forced to punt on their next posses-

sion, but they turned to cheers when Chuck

Brown caught and downed Pitt punter

Greg DeBolt’s kick on the Rutgers 2—yardg
line.

Harris called it “one of the pretiiest
plays in football.” But six plays later, with
the Knights facing a third-and-5 on their

' own 17-yard line, safety Seth Homack
committed one of the ugliest.

McMahon threw a bullet to Hutton
near the ﬁrst-down marker, but Homack
climbed over the receiver’s back before the
ball arrived. The pass-interference penalty
kept the drive alive, and the Knight offense
chewed up 6:16 with a 15-play series that
resulted in a ﬁeld goal. 7

The teams traded quick possessions in
the ﬁnal minutes, giving Lytle a chance to
win the contest with 36 seconds remaining.
After a quick ﬁrst down, the quarterback
ﬁred a deep pass for Murphy but had it
intercepted by a leaping Jabati Moore.

“We sat back on the [11-point] cush-
ion,” said Lytle, describing his team’s sec-
ond half performance. “For whatever rea-
son, we didn’t come back and execute.”
