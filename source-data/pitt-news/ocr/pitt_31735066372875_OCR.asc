year have until .1-\pril 1.3 to file

an annual report of their L981 .

spokesman said recently.

The 1981 aiitiual tixeinpt
atiiount was 5S;3,5()() for people
6:3 or over and .‘3~l,()80 for people
under .65 all of 1981. A person
who was 72 or older all of 1981
does not have to make a report.
Neither do people who receive
benefits because of disal)ili.ty-,

A person who did not receive
any checks in 1981 because of
expected earnings does not have
to make a report of his or her
earnings. But, the representa-
tive said, if those earnings were

in that person's best interest to
make a report.

Since 351 in benefits is with-
held for every $2 of earnings

above the annual exempt
amount, it could be that some
benefits may be due. If they are,
they will be paid after the
annual report is reviewed.

Most people who have to
make a report of their 1981 earn-
ings have already received a
form for this purpose_in the
mail. Those who did not receive
an annual report form or those
who misplaced the one they did
receive can get a copy at any

Pitt ResidentAssistants  

Keep An Eye On Dorms

By KAREN SABOKBAR

Students who hit the lucky
numbers in the housing lottery
might feel fortunate at having
secured a dorm room for next
year—-but there's another group of
students who got housing--only
they don’t have to pay for it.

Of course there’s a catch. Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh resident assist-
ants (RA’s) receive free room and
board in exchange for policing
Pitt's residence halls.

There are 83 RA’s at Pitt (41
female and 42 male) who are in
charge of the 4200 resident stu-

I dents. Each RA is assigned to

approximately 50-60 students,
although’Tower A and Tower B
have smaller groups of 40 and the
two McCormick RA’s have larger
-groups of 70. .

The major responsibilities of a
resident assistant include letting
the students know where to go for
help, and maintaining order and
control, especially _ with’, their
assigned group. According to ‘Jo
Ann vWoodson, directoryjof the

‘ Office of Resident Life (ORL) it’sa
job that puts them at the “beck and
call of students.',' - ;

The RA’s are assigned threeduty
nights a week,,from 8PM~'.-8AM,

and they must’ be “on duty",3-4-

weekends a term. a

“At the beginningof theyearl
had to learn how to adjust my
‘studying time,” said Lori Gilbert,
an RA from Holland‘!-fall, “but
after a while you learn to make the

most of the situation. Sometimes, it
can be full-time craziness.”

Two-time RA, Bob Peters, who
is responsible for the first five
floors of McCormick Hall, agreed
that it's a hectic job. RA’s often
find themselves in the position of
being disciplines.

“Last year when I was an RA in
Tower B," said Peters, “things
were different. It was mostly an all
freshman floor, and I was seen as
more of a disciplinary RA than I
am now.

“Because they were younger and
didn’t know each other as well as
people in the suites, I had to deal
with constant hassless in the mid-
dle of the night.”

Usually the RA’s only have to
concentrate on problems with
assigned group, and ‘ occasional
dorm problems; one night last term
however, every’ RA available had to

-deal with_all the resident students

at once.
» A chain-reaction of bombarding

. the quad with any throwablc object

ignited through the dorms the
weekend of the Florida State foot-

, ball ;game._ The campus police were

called, but the bottles, bricks,
apples, etc. continued to descend.

C

“It was unbelievable,” Gilbert
said. “Everyone was throwing
ihings out the windows and the
cops actually told us to stand in the
middle of the quad and get
control."

The destruction, chaos, and vio-
lence ended when the resident
assistants and directors thought of
a better plan.

“We were sent from dorm to

s

troubled students, telling others to
turn the music down, and opening
doors for those locked-out of their
rooms.

The requirements for the RA
position are: 2.5 Quality Point
Average, junior or Senior status,
and demonstratable skills of
leadership. . .

At the beginning of December
applications are made available for

full-time students. These appli-'

cants must be completed and
returned to the ORI. by the middle
of January for consideration.
“This year 331 students picked
up applications," said Woodson,"
178 of these were completed and
returned to us and 83 were chosen
from our selection process.”
Beside the application itself, a
transcript and letters of reference

“We look for people who can interact effectively
in, a group situation. Leadership skills and the

cumstances are -most important——personality

knock on doors, go in, and make
sure all the windows were closed.
’We had to calm everyone down."

Although being an RA has its
exciting V moments, the usual
agenda includes talking to

Since the ORI. was established
in 1972. the RA’s RD’s and other
members of the ()RL have min-
imal conflicts.

“Whenever you deal with an
administrator and a worker you're
going to have some friction, result-

things should be done." Peters

said. “But, generally if we do haveﬁ

problem we take it to the RD, who
in turn takes it to the ORLQ"

As long as the RA’s adhere to
their rules and regulations as siti-
dents and the terms of agreement of
a resident assistant, they will avoid.
reprimands from the ORL.

“The most common warning,"

said Woodson, “involves failure to

attend mandatory workshop ses-

beforehand, then a brief discussion
and warning will result."

Vaﬁous
Careers

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

Approximately 30 professionals
came to the Forbes Quadrangle
Wednesday to discuss job oppor-
tunities in various fields of busi— ’\
ness and communications. ' l‘

The University Counseling Cen-
ter has sponsored the career
seminar every fall for the past 12
years; this year, because of many
requests from students, they added
an extra day of the seminar in the
spring.

“It’s information that the stu-
dents really» need,” said Teddy
Fakles, a counselor at the Career
Counseling Center.

“The idea of the open conference
is for students to be able to talk
informally with people in all of the
different occupations,” said
Fakles.

Mike Pak, thedirector of market-
ing for the Pittsburgh Spirit soccer
team, who talked to students about
opportunities in sports manage-
ment at the seminar, said that
while the usual advice of how to
dress for an interview or how to
speak to prospective employers is
important, he Knows 01 more prac-
tical advice about how to get one’s
foot in the door of a company
through things such as
internships.

“I think a lot of kids aren’taware
of what's going on in the job
market," he said. “They don’t real-
ize what’s expected of them."

The seminar has been very» bene-‘yr
ficial to students with different.
degrees of need for career
information.

“I have to declare a major pretty
soon, and I have no idea what kind
of career I want to get into,” said
one Pitt sophomore. “I saw a lot of
interesting careers this afternoon.”

Ted Schott, a senior, came to the
seminar to look at prospective
careers to which he might apply his
cornmunications/psychology ma-
_]0l".

“I’m just trying to see what doors
are open to me now,” he said.

Pak said he feels it is essential to-
draw a realistic picture of the on —
look of the job market for studetﬁ”
and the seminar provides the per-
fect vehicle for doing this.

ol the money it invests in a joint
research with a university~.»

The university would also
benefit greatly from such a venture.
Pointing to a specific L‘)u'vlII1p'l'.’,
«Olson said that Pitt stands to gain
10 percent of the equity if an absor-
bent of carbon monoxide——a pro-
duct of- a joint research project
between the university and a pri-
vate group ‘of inyestors—is
marketed. "

“These royalty surpluses can l)e
fed back into the-university’s ap-
plied and basic research projects,”
said Olson. “Students will be able
to gain access to advanced indus-
trial research labs, and at the same
time, such efforts will make it pos-
sible to renovate university labs "

  
  

Olson said he believes ihe uni-
versity can make another major
contribution in this type of
research field by bringing the skills
of the university's S()(l1ll scientists
and economists into the picture to
discern the major impacts ‘of mar-
keting a technical innovation.

The outlook for government
research during" the next ten years
will depend on such factors as (lon-
gress‘ powei‘ and Pitt's research
competitiveness, according to
Associate Provost for Research
Alan  fisher. ’

“‘I)espite all the electric shock
treatment the federal government
has exposed universities to during
the past 1:") months, it is too early to
be oyer—pessimistic about the
future of t‘ese'trch " said Fisher

  

 

  
   

fire o

“The ‘NationalInstitute of Health
(NIIeI),and the Nzttioital Institute of
Iiducation (NIE) are two of the fed-
eral agencies that Pitt has a inajor~
itv of its research projects with and
neither of these are among the
agencies facing huge cuts."
According to Fisher, 81 percent
of all of Pitt's research is funded by
the federal government and the
current projected research cuts of
$55-(S5 million would mean a ill-1'2
million loss to Pitt annually.
Despite the fact that in less than
one~;>*fiscal year, the rate of research
growth has been cut by two—thirds
to 7 percent, Olson is encouraged
by Congress‘ restoration of
research cuts; in social and behav-
ioral sciences asked for by the
‘ma -‘entent and Budget

Financial Aid ToBé Cut In Half

“Pitt has the advantage in the
future because it is competitive and
a top research school in the nation.
It also provides healthy alterna-
tives to the single research proje(t
with its interdisplinar\' studies
such as the Learning Research and
Deyeloprnent (Ienter," said Fisher.
“It's a matter‘ of weathering what
could be viewd as storntv period
indeed. ” »

In his report to the llniyersity
Senate, (lhancellor Wesley Posvar
gave an a('(‘t)titrt- of last‘ week’s
budget hearings before the state
legislature in Harrisburg, at which
he and Pittadministrators stressed

the severe budgets constraints Pitt

is under and expressed “acute cori-

tern" about the ptojectetl 539 mil-
Iion loss ol federal aid for students.

 

“'I"hey were very receptive,
inquiring about such things as,

Honors Prorram science resear‘ 
.% Y,
})t‘()_|(‘('tS, and our medical trarr '5

plant operations," said Posyar.
“We were reassured that our
request for state—sponsored loans to
medical students has a chance of
becoming reality if the legislature
passes a law that makes tax-exeinpt
bonds available for medical and
other graduate students.”

“Not only has Gov. Ihornburgh
rectified the former administra-
tion’s unfair‘ treatment of state-
related schools, but he has also kept
his promise to make education a
higher priority by giving the uni-

versity a (5 percent increase in ztll<i-ﬂ_\

cations for the coming fiscal year,

Opinion  

Educaﬁonal
Discrimination

Just when we thought the smoke hadgcleared over the
Reagan administration's decision in January to support-—
and then not support—tax-exempt status for alleged dis-
criminatory practices at Bob Jones University, the folks in
4 V ‘ the federal Department oftEducation put some logs on the
fire.

According to a report out of Washington yesterday, the
Reagan administration is considering a proposal to

r ‘ remove loans granted under the guaranteed student loan

program from coverage underfederal anti-discrimination
laws. The major difference between this proposal and the
-one that would have given tax-exempt status to Bob Jones
University, is that instead of directly sanctioning discrimi-
nation, the administration is leaving it up to the colleges
and private lenders. E I H

The guaranteed student loanprogram (GSL) was estab-
lished under the Higher Education Act of 1965, primarily \
to subsidize low-interest loans for students. In addition,
the program also insures loans made by private lenders to
studentsand pays the difference between the student inter-
est rate, currently 9 percent, and market rates. In 1981,
more than 3.5 million new loans were’ made to students
totalling $7.7 billion at a cost to the government of $2.6
billion. _ I ’ '

It should be pointed out that of "those 3.5 million bor-
rowers, about two-thirds were from families with incomes
below $25,000, an income level which presumably
includes many of the nation’s minority families.

Besides excluding the guaranteed student loan program
from federal discrimination laws, the administration will
add insult to injury with its proposed reductions and
increased restrictions on the program ‘scheduled for April
1. The new proposals include the doubling of the origina-
tion fee, hr the fee paid as soon as the loaniis received from
the bank; need for loans would have to be proven by -
students of any income level; instead of only those who

\ ~ come from families with an adjusted gross income of

more than $30,000; borrowers would have to pay market

’ interest rates two years after beginning repayment instead

' ‘ of the current 9 percent interest for the life_Ioftheloan;and
‘graduate and'professional students would be ineligible‘

under the program, i

. ' 9

All in all, it doesn’t matter what color you are, if you've
been relying upon the guaranteed loan program to get
through school; the only color that matters these days is '
the green, in dollar bills. The irony of the situation, how-
ever, is that as the Reagan administration dismantles the
hard-fought efforts of the civil rights movement, it has
committed itself to a bungling attempt to increase the
number of blacks and Hispanics in the federal labor force.

The affirmative action plan results from the govern-
ment.’s consent to a discrimination suit filed by civil rights
groups concerned that a majority of blacksand Hispanics
were not scoring as well as whites on the federal, employ-
ment test, commonly known as PACE for the Professional
and Administrative Career Examination. Thus far, how-
ever, the administration is discovering that no matter what
it does to revise the test, blacks and Hispanics still score
consistently lower than whites. Not only can’t it get its act
together on the test, but the administration has also had to
field charges that consenting to the suit is basically a
consent to create legal quotas.

So, while the administration tries to figure out what to

do in its own house, policy-makers, most noticeably those .

in the Education Department, seem to. think that they can
divert attention from their own internal bungles by creat-

. ing havoc on the outside, mainly for students.

Dear Editor:

Once upon a time I went tothis
place to study called Hillman. I
journeyed up to the second floor

._ during the early evening. Not hav-

ing been to the building in some
time, it was not quite what I

« expected. J

The pair to the left of me was
having an intellectually stimulat-
ing converse about the tactical
advantage of the 3-4 football
defense over the 4-3 strategy. How-
ever, I was not interested. The _cou-

_ ple to my right were obviously in

love.» They played funny games and
talked somewhatquickly. Straight
ahead, a whole group at a long
tablehad been carrying on several
discussions during the hour that I
was there. I’m most sure their inter-
change concerned matters of great
"import.” On the other side of the
section people were dancing and
singing. One swinger said to
another that the first floor was even
more fun than the second. Two
tables away, a quite pretty and jo-
vial group was eating and drinking
and being merry. ’ "

By then, looking around more
_carefully, I_ noticed‘that of all the

people in the section I was the only ,

one not engaging in some form of
discourse. Confused, Isought some
clarification from the group at the

long table by calmly asking them __

to keep it down a little. “I am try-
ing tow study.” I informed them.

the wrong place. Hillman is not a
library at all.

One and all they laughed and
howled. One member proclaimed '
it was the best one she had heard all

had brought such joy into their
lives and at last I realized I was in

Pitt’s -Elevator Repair Belowstandard

Dear Editor,

I would like to bring it to your

attention that Pitt's elevator repair *‘

The delay of repairing these but-
tons causes many students to wait

Baseball TeamHit
WithHard Luck

B)/“BARRY ZASLOFF

 The ugly eyes of fate are glaring

   

it

 Pitt Panther baseball team,
telling them that/th?y should have
remained north. ”
 T he Panther are currently strug-
glmgthrough a redefined version
of sprmgtrainingatan eventcalled
the Rollins College Baseball Week
in Winter Park Fla., leading one to
wonder where all of the team’s
lucky leprechauns have gone.

It all ‘began last week_ on the
plane trip to Florida when I the
Panthers’ luggage mysteriously
disappeared sometime after takeoff
and before arrival, turning clothes
into a valuable commodity. if

Adding to this were hotel accom-

' nodations that were anything but

accommodating, as a mixup left
some of the Panthers hunting for a
place to stay.

To further complicate matters,
the Panthers ar'e laboring through
the same bad fortunes on the base-
ball .diamond. So ' "far, they have
played and lost four games--9-3 to
host Rollins, 11-2 to‘ Eastern Ken-

~ tucky, and 14-8 and 14-13 to Army.

Graduation has taken its toll on
Pitt. Gone are seven players,
including. three-fourths of last
year’s staring infield. . .

A “Rebuilding the infield is a
major challenge this year,“” said
Panther coach Bobby Lewis before
the season. “We have a lot of work

people there. Mike Fitzpatrick will
return, A and Jon Adams, who
backed up at third last season, is
back. We’re also looking for some
new people. to step into, the
‘infield.”

Also noticeably absent are
would-be senior pitchers Allen
Lachowichz, a No. 1 pick of the
Texas Rangers in last year's June
baseball draft, and Larry
LaMonde—the 21st choice of the

Pittsburgh Pirates in the same A

draft. Only 6-4 righthander Aaron

Krause--8-Oilast year-returns to if

the starting rotation.

“We must] rebuild our pitching
staff,” Lewis said at the end of last
season. “I hope some of our-young
people can step in and help
somewhere.

“We were devastated by gradua-
tion,”. Lewis continued. “You
don’t replace the quality players

" ,that we lost that easily. Wehave a

lot of rebuilding to do.”

One place thatithe Panthers are
in good shape is the outfield, with
Doug Steiner, a .333 hitter, and-

 Darrell Gissendanner, a .346'hitter,

both returning.

Apparently the outfield. is the
one bright spot for Lewis, save the
A 90 degree Florida temperatures.
But with theway things have gone
so far, the'players will probably
return with a sunburn instead of a
suntan. r i

. Pitt's Darrell Gissendanner boasts the top batting average

ampng the returning regulars on the Pitt baseball team.

Gymnasts 1
Plot For
Penn State

Challenge

By MIKE ROSE

As the Pitt Panther men's gym-_
nastics team approaches its season
finale tomorrow against archrival
‘Penn ‘ ‘State, Pitt coach Frank
D’Amico plots his strategy for the
unlikely upset.

The worrisome but ever-
op.timistic coach, while acknow-
ledginglthat Penn State has been
scoring several points higher than
Pitt this season, hasn't given up the
hope of toppling the Nittany
Lions, currently rated two notches

above fourth-ranked Pitt in the 3

Eastern standings. .
“We will need a score of 273 to

‘beat Penn State,” D’Amico pre-

dicted. “We are trying to gain one-
tenth of a point per man in each
event. If we can do this, then our

total score will increase three’

points.

Such thinking (by day, when he
isn't teaching backflips, D’Amico
doubles as a Pitt mathematics
teacher) reveals that three addi-'"

tional points, tacked on to the 267

* mark Pitt has already achieved this A
season, would lift the team within , .,

striking distance of the nation’s

Top 20 rankings, ifnot Penn State- 9

And ‘even though D’Amico
admitted,it’.s highly improbable
his team could score six points
higher than th.ez267 Pitt record they

set last week against West Virginia,

  Pidgeon Visits
Third and Last Time

By SEAN BARNES-

Sandy Pidgeon and seven of his
teammates will journey to Milwau-
kee next weekend for the men’s
NCAA Divison I National Swim-
ming and Diving Championships.
This will be Pidgeon’s third and
final trip to Nationals as he moves
up to Pitt's graduate school after
this year. _

Pidgeon qualified for the meet in
three events-one event for each of
the three days of the nationally tele-
vised swimming championships.
This is the Superbowl of swim-
ming, and Pidgeon and his Pitt
teammates are intent on. moving
the University of Pittsburgh swim—
ming team to a Top 20 in national
rankings. X .

Pidgeon is qualified for ~ the
second consecutive year in the 200-
yard breaststroke, as well as the
400-yard indi’vidual medley, the
event in which he set a seemingly
untouchable record at Easterns two
weeks ago and the 400-yard medley
relay, in which he swims the
second leg breaststroke. _,

As ironic as it may sound, this

i valuable swimmer to the Pitt team

was not recruited, but rather made

the squad as a walk—on on 1978.
“They didn’t need another
breaststroker,” said Pidgeon. “Pitt
already had the three best breast-
strokers in’ the East. My second
place in the 200-yard breaststroke
at my’ freshman Easterns (regional
championships) sbrt of shocked
the team then. We took -first,
second, third and fourth in that
event.” ’
Because of those other top breast-
strokers on Pitt’s team, Pidgeon
there was nothing left in him. But
even when the pressure graduated,
Pidgeon did not slack off-in prac-
tice. There are few swimmerstoday

never ask us to do it, but we felt
so good about doing it because
the ground crew members are

' big Pitt fans.-” _

‘ Of course. run-ins between a
‘coach and the groiindskeeper
were not ‘uncommon either.
“(John) Michelosen (head
football coach from 1955 to
1965) wanted to practice on the
field while I was ordered by the

athletic director to cover it,”

Czarnecki said.‘ “He (Michel-
osen) said, ‘If you don’t”get the
cover off, I’ll punch ‘you’.
That is the time you are put in
the middle.” '

In general, Czarnecki and the
current coaching staff get along
‘well, though he says he has to
treat them differently during
the season as compared to after

“The coaches and I get along
well in general,” - Czarnecki
said ‘‘I don’t deal with coaches
in the same way as they aren't
normal during the season.”.

Czarnecki recalled a couple of I

‘incidents involving current
football coach Foge Fazio and

‘basketball coach Dr. Roy Chip- I

man/.
I When F oge took over the job,

’ one of the first things he did was

to getrid of the county cops that
escort the head coach off the
job,” Czarnecki said. “S_o I said
to him, ‘It’s_ going to be tough
for these Italian guys to hide
their guns under their coats
during the hoi days of Sep-
tember and October’.”

As for his anecdote on Chip-
man, Czarnecki recalls, “Roy

  

Leo ‘Horse’ Czarnecki iti't')'

was pretty down during the
season so I went up to -him and
told a joke about a 7-2 recruit
going_into the Field House on a
recruiting trip. He hits his head
against the door and knocks
himself out. They hide ‘him in
Presbyterian Hospital and pro-
tect him from recruiters from
Penn State and Duquesne.” I
He adds, “Roy has gotten a

‘ lot of mileage out of the two-by-

fours he”has now. He is an
excellent coach and a joy to talk

As for his opinions on
coaches in general, Czarnecki
said, “They are regular guys

saysrhis motto is “I never found
a coach I couldn’t talk to.”

Czarnecki has as many opin-V

One thing‘ Czarnecki takes
pride in is the job his ground
crew does.
“When we have a deadline to

done in that time,” Czarnecki
(A said. “It’s not a nine-to-five

But it’s aljob that keeps Horse
Czarnecki involved with Pitt
athletics. A

one that threatens football this
year. He also said college ath- ,
letes should have a different
curriculum since “they are pre-

Czarnecki added that perhaps

that practice as hard as Pidgeon.
His long-distance,’ top-quality
workouts showed clearly in his
winning 4,00-yard individually
medley swim at Easterns. The
second place swimmer was still full
one-half of a pool length behind
when Pidgeon touched for the new
Eastern Regional record.

He first began his serious train-
ing at Kiski Prep, where his father
was the swimming coach. Kiski
Prep has turned out All-Americans
in swimming year after year, and
Pidgeon was no exception, captur-
jng All-America status his senior
year there in breaststroke.

Pidgeon’s younger brother is
Kiski Prep’s latest power in
breaststroke.

“He’s as big as I am already, and
he’s only a sophomore,” said Pid-
geon. He may be as tall, but if
you’ve ever seen the muscular chest
of Pidgeon, you’d know his brother
still has a way to go in the weight
room before his is as big as his older
brother. I

Pidgeon Hopes 3rd Visit   to Nationals a Charm

installed this champion quality in
his son that only took a coach such
as Fred Lewis and the opportunity
to unleash it against colleges today.
Pidgeon had liked what he heard
about Lewis and Pitt, and, with
both his academics and swimming
career in mind, chose Pitt.

Since Pidgeon’s first day on the
team, his easy-going, confident
attitude has rubbed off on his team-
mates more than Pidgeon even
seems to suspect. He will help any
fellow swimmer with any problem,
from stroke technique in the water,
weight techniques in the training
room, homework at school to prob-
lems in their social lives.

“The camaraderie of the team is
what I’ll miss the most,” said Pid-
geon. “We’ve spent lots of hours in
the water together, always working
harder to improve over yesterday.
We've become very tight. We prob-L’
ably know each other better than
our mothers. It seems my best
friends are all swimmers.”

Pidgeon described his feelings
about how Pitt ends a week of swim
practice.,“Friday’s practice I alway
look forward to. We all put in
tough Fridays and always get crazy

at practice. At the training table,
we’re always famished and we wolf
down more food than usual, being
just as crazy. Then, since so many
of us live so close together in
Lothrop, we all go to our rooms
and crank up our stereos and open
our doors and get even crazier.

“Of course,” he added “We’ve
got to remember that there is a Sat-
urday morning practice, but we
definately know how to loosen
up.”

It seems all Pitt's swimmers have
a great affection for music and-—
practical applications for it. Pid-
geon described how there are all
three levels to a swimmer’s con-
sciousness while swimming.

“There's the music Ievel,” began
Pidgeon, “where you think of
tunes. It seems very natural with
the way swimming is such a rhyth-
mic sport. .

“Then there is the side of you‘

that is always working to improve
your stroke and times. You’ll count
your strokes or be checking how
much you’re stretching, or count-
less other things you learn from
experience,” Pidgeon said. Then
there is the third state, where you’re

(‘bu cil

..__.

thinking of your school and social
life. People who swim or do long-
distance running know what I'm
talking about. That being alone,
just yourself, seems to give
swimmers an inner peace I don't
see in many other sports.”

This inner peace is well exempli-
fied by .a1l'swimmers, for as they
approach the block for their events,
they do it alone. _

“Sure the crowd and my team-
mates add to my psych,” said Pid-
geon, “but when you lose an event
in swimming, it was no one’s fault
but your own. Therefore, I have my
own psych I achieve before my
event, just like every other
swimmer has his own psych."

Pidgeon says he is at his highest
peak physically right now. He will
continue training after Nationals
for the World Championships in
Equador in July. Only the best in
each event will qualify from the
United States, and since it may be
Pidgeon’s last swim meet while he
is at such a peak, he is prepared to
suffer the pain of a summer's long-
course workouts for the chance to
compete. “Those workouts make
college workouts seem like a pic-

“An Elephant

nic,” Pidgeon said. Those summer
workouts include an eight-hour

day of training-—five hours in the "

water and three hours on weights.
Work willconsist of lifeguard duty
for another five hours or so with
couple hours of time free per day
probably. being spent catching up
on sleep.

“I’m glad to have been part of
such a great team and program like
Pitt’s,” said Pidgeon. “Fred
(Lewis) is just starting to blossom
as a coach. He’s the best I've swam
under. He’s underrated now
because of all the coaches that
coach in the sunbelt states. But
he'll get the respect he deserves.”

Pidgeon no longer needs to
prove himself to Pitt; but he’ll
keep trying for recognition at
Nationals. V

His spirit has helped Lewis in
his coaching and his teammates in
their swimming. As part of the
East’s largest contingent qualified

for Nationals, Pidgeon has already

accepted’ the pressure of three
events at Nationals and looks for-
ward to facing the world in July in
Equador-—representing Pitt as
well as the United States.

call it Peach Ball,” Wooden said. “I
told him it sounded too much like a
football game." _
“I imagine you've seen a lot of
changes since then in basketball.”
“Changes?” Wooden hissed.
“Changes are only good when
you're talking sweat socks——I used
to tell Kareem that too. Whew!
When you start making changes,
you destroy the beauty and appeal
of the game." -
“Coach, what do you think of

“Never like 'em. The name of the

‘all wore Spalding, it might be OK.

wanted to put ‘Nirvana’ or ‘Karma’
on his jersey, but I vetoed it."

Perhaps the most grating thing
about the boot-licking, perpetua-
tion of Wooden’s other-worldly
image is its lack of truth.

As recent reports in the.,_Los.

thing transcendental about Wood-

Recruiting news. . .

Things don't look too bright for
the Pitt basketball team's recruit-
ing efforts. First, reliable sources
have said that 6-7 forward Ken
Walker from Georgia is currently
leaning towards the University of
Kentucky, and earlier this week it
was reported that 6-4 guard Bryan
Mitchell had verbally committed to
Tennessee. Both players are being.
heavily recruited by the Panthers.

Meanwhile,
rounding where Clairton’s Lloyd
Moore, will go to school continues.
The 6-9 center, the area’s most
sought-after recruit, apparently
was going to Duquesne until head
coach Mike Rice was fired. Now,
Pitt and Marquette-appear to be
back in the running for Moore’s
services. Moore had indicted that
he would make a decision before
the Roundball Classic on April 2,
but now he says he may wait until
Duquesne names it new head
coach. '

The Panthers are not seriously‘
going after any other area player,
although they are still talking to
Upper St. Ciair’s ]oe~David.

Tim Grgurich

Tim‘ Grgurich returning ‘to
Pittsburgh to coach Duquesne?
That's» Va‘ union as seemingly
unlikely as Chuck Tanner and
pessimism or Pitt and Andy
Sissini. '_ ‘ i\'  ” 3'

The" Post-Gazette reported that

Grgurich, ex—Pitt head coach and‘
now an assistant to Jerry Tarkan-
ian at Nevada-Las Vegas, will be
interviewed by the Duquesne
search committee along with
American University’s head has-
ketball coach Gary Williams.

Grgurich resigned from his Pitt
job in 1980, after losing 65-63 to
Duquesne in the first round of the
NIT. Grgurich, who compiled a
69-70 mark in his five years with
the Panthers, later reapplied for the
job.

Whoever gets the Duquesne job
would receive a salarV of between
$50,000 and $60,000 a year, plus
complete control over the basket-
ball program, according to the ,
Duke’s athletic department. ’

Meanwhile, James Madison bas-
kqtball coach Lou Campanelli
took his name out of the running .
for the Duquesne job. Campenelli
said he was “flattered that his name
was been mentioned in regards to
coaching positions at both Seton

Hall and Duquesne,"'but added‘ in

that he was not interested in coach- -
mg at either school.

rriakes sure ‘beg bike is
in perfect shape ~
- She inspects and

adiusts every part. She

tunes and balances ‘
the whole machine, so

Because she
treats her bodytthe

' ered a lump in‘her-
breast a few years

ago. X ‘ .
She discovered it

early. And these days,
85% of early breast

successfully. ‘
Judy has since

had reconstructive _,

again. Alive, vibrant,

A ready to get on her

Judy Lafferty is

lust one example of

the kind of progress
we're making against
cancer in its many
forms.

The American
Cancer Society takes
some credit for that
progtess. But credit
won't finance our
work.

_ We need your
money to help us win
