By Mail

At last Monday’s general meet—  _ 

ing of the University community

in the Common Facilities Build-.

ing, Provost Charles Peake prom-
ised that any changes in the Dec.

3 ROTC decision of the Faculty of ’ “ .
Arts,and Sciences would have to .

be made by the faculty.

The vote to modify De”c.i'*3'. ac-
tion is being conducted by mail.
The ballots were issued Friday
and must be returned by Feb. 24. ‘

Instructors and Teaching, As-3

sistants,‘ who were permitted to
vote on the original decision,

‘have not been sent ballots.

The following is a copy of
that ballot:

“At the first general meeting
of the Faculty of Arts and‘Scien/--
ces on December 3, 1968, the
Faculty approved this motion.
put- before the house by the Un-
dergraduate Council: S

I hereby move that this Faculty
award no academic credit for

ROTC courses, except thatany _ “

student currently enrolled in eith-
e-r a basic or advanced program
may complete that program with
credit as currently granted.

The Provost and I are disturbed ’ 4 » 
that the rﬁotion as passed worked,  V 1*

a hardship on those students now

enrolled in the basic program who - x 

had made plans to go on to the

advanced program. This is elabor- .

ated in a memorandum of Feb-
ruary 5, 1969. to you from’ J.
Steele Gow who was then serving
as Acting Provost. We therefore

ruled administratively that stu-,

dents currently enrolled in the
basic program be permitted to‘
continue in the advanced program
for‘ credit shouldthey desire to do

so. The action of the Faculty re--

mains otherwise unchanged.

We now wish to withdraw our

ruling and submit the matter to V

Faculty vote.

Do you agree to modify the ac-V" 
tion of the,Facu1ty as indicated  '

,above?

Many faculty members feel
that a mail ballot is an effort to
cut off any further debate on the
issue. The Undergraduate Coun-
cil discussed the issue involved in

this modification before the Dec. ..

3 vote, but the issue wasnot rais-
ed at that meeting.

RESIDENCE JUDICIAL
BOARD

Applications for justices in
the new Residence Hall Judi-
cial Board must be in by Wed-
nesday. This is a combined
board of men and women._Ap-
plications should be turned in
to either Nick Gervase or the

Once upon a time there was a little boy_
who always was playing with his naval.
Everybody told him that this was bad,»
that he would go blind, that hair would
grow on his palms, but he persisted. Fin-
ally one day he heard a public servant
announcement on WPCH that stated . . .
“CAUTION: playing with your naval may ,
be hazerdous to your health. So instead
he went out and bought a pack o cigar-

Editor's note: In view of the fact that
we have just returned from an Editor's Con-

vention and are frantically trying to catch ‘

' up on the work we missed, we thought we

~ would reprint an article from The Post,
Ohio University's daily paper in place of
an editorial.

So, we will by-pass Senator Fleming,
ROTC, Trustees, the Language Require-
ment etc. for a few days and study, cram,
but never cheat, for our mid-terms.

You’ll N e<ver Know It . . . Even Here

now?
Don’t you feel guilty? Aren’t you
sorry for the error of your ways‘?
The early bird catches the worm.

Unquote.

Cram, friends. Cram until the mid-
term is handed out.

Cram all night, cram until you
hear the birds-chirping, then cram all
day.

Cram until your head aches. your
eyes redden, and dark circles map your
face.

Cram until equations swim before
your eyes, until you can recite the
poetry backwards and forwards, until
you remember middle names and sub-
titles. ’

Cram until you think you can’t
cram anymore. then cram some more.

Gulp No-Doz, suck bennies.

Open the windows, take cold show-
ers.

Send out for pizza, keep the coffee
hot.

Memorize. _

Memorize facts, dates, and names.

Memorize theories, systems and
laws.

Memorize your instructor’s likes and
dislikes. Psych out what he’ll ask, then
memorize that.

Memorize chapter summaries and
Cliff ’s Notes.

Memorize the date, place and time
of your mid-term.,

And when all else fails, cheat.

Print those hard-to—remember facts
on your hand. your kleenex or the
back of your tie.

« Excuse yourself to go to_ the john
where your roommate lS waiting with
your notebook.

Sit next to the smartest kid in the
class and train yourself in inconspic-
uous spying.

Slip a page ‘of formulas into your
shoe, your shirt, your coat pocket.

Wait until the proctor leaves the
room, then sneak a peek at- your text
book — theone you never read.

For this is “learning.” This is col-
lege and the system we’ve adopted.
This is what we call an education,
this is what we pay for this is the
foundation upon which we’re building
our lives’ careers.

It is an immutable aspect of the
American college experiencek to be
laughed at when it’s all over.

“Ah, those were the days. . . .”
“The time of my life . . . 

“Remember when we went into
that test and. . . 

“The best years of my life. . . .”

From this atmosphere emerges our
teachers, our doctors, our lawyers,
our journalists, our engineers . . _. and
some of our failures.

This is the American college ex-
perience. Sometimes a fault of in-
stitutions, sometimes a fault of pro-
fessor, but mostly a fault of students
and 20th Century American Society.

Cram.

Commuter Problems

 

,Commuter-

Editor, The Pitt News:

I would like to congratulate Dave Tier-
nan on a really magnificent article “Hooked
on a feeling.” I don’t think that I can say
I know how you feel about the language re-
quirement, but I’m sure that on many
other shortcomings of today’s society. I am

 equally disgusted. .
, L People today are adhering to antiquated 
modes of conduct and thought that were

worthless when established and are less then
worthless today. This in itself is disgusting
but when you ask why and they can give
no better reason than that it’s always been
this way. then you really begin to get sick.
I often wonder how people can readily ac-
cept such absurdities without even ques-
tioning them or themselves.

It’s nice to_ know there are other people .

around who don’t just sit down and accept
standards being imposed upon them without
question. I can only add that I’m sorry

y I can’t help you with your German.

Carol Nowicki

Editor, /The Pitt News:

I'm one of the young [kids sitting in
Spanish 4 who has not yet heard Rabbi.
Rubenstein. What I have heard, though.

’ means far more to me at the moment. I

have heard you echoing my beliefs of what
a liberal education should be and I have
watched you go through all the alternatives
we are offered and reject each one, just as

I . , I have done.

But you did not continu_e toevaluate the
reasons and possible merits of the system
we are now under. In some small way I

~ _. can understand your insatiable desire for

knowledge. In my own way, I too share

‘your thirst. But in spite of my youth. or

perhaps because of it. I also realize the need

 for a structured liberal education.

After complaining ignorantly about the
language requirements for six months, I re-
cently had occasion to question the adminis-
tration on this point. Dr. Watson; Ass’t.
Dean of the College. explained the langu-

- , age requirement as a necessary part of our

education. He did give me a history of
language requirements pa for the past
seven years, which made me feel a little

A, less persecuted, but still peeved at my pre-

sent restriction.

Dr. McClelland went one’ step further
and said language proficiency was requir-
ed in all graduate schools. Apparently the

. ’ four terms of a language are enough to
’ pass this test. But, not so! Dr. McClel-
' land admitted that most students had to take

a refresher course before taking the test.

So. where does this leave us? Stuck in a
linguistics mire that is so thick we can’t
see bottom. Structure. form. continuity —
all are needed for a workable liberal arts
education. But the structure is not pliable.

, the form is bulky, the continuity leaves ,

gaps.
" Possibly, if Josh Chasen and Dean Peake

and Joe Kociubes accept the challenge of-

fered them at today's confrontation — we
will get the renovated language. long af-
ter we are directly affected. Until then. I

'can only remind you that there is_a sympa-

thetic listener in 622 Holland.

Editor, The Pitt News, ‘

- The letter by David F. Tiernan ( “I
can’t Forget What That Book Represents”)
in the Pitt News of 2-10-69 merits some com-
ment.

It is unfortunate that Mr. Tiernan. as
many students and non-students. still fails
to understand the real reason for the lang-
uage requirement. Some of these were giv-
en in my letter of 7-17-68 to the Pitt
News, which you published subsequently;
it included the main fact that the study

of a foreign language leads to a better un— ,

derstanding of one’s native language.

The study of a foreign language also
provides the basis for a knowledge of other

-cultures. Which language is selected, is of

minor importance. ‘If Mr. Tiernan finds
German so difficult. he might satisfy the
requirement by trying another language —
and he might even profit t'rom the exper-
ience.

The appreciation of other cultures
through the study of their languages is es-
pecially important for a journalist. as Mr.
Tiernan aspires to become. If more jour-
nalists had this appreciation, we would
have better journalism. It seems to to be
characteristic that we always go out of our
way in an attempt to make others under-
stand us. but that we are willing to devote
very little effort in trying to understand
others. For all we know, we might even find
solutions to our current problems by learn-
ing from others; neither ghettoes nor rats
are particularly new.

Mr. Tiernan bemoans the fact that other
students do” not know who Jean Paul Sar-
tre is; if Mr. Tiernan knew French. he
would have an even better understanding
of Sartre than he possibly could have now.

Editor, The Pitt News:

This letter is a reply to Bruce Leven-
son’s colurrinof Feb. 12. (“Commuter
Shmuter") In the depressing tradition of
this newspaper. it is fraught with distor-
tions and falsehoods. The opening state-
ment is the first distortion. Certainly trans-

. portation (parking) is a major concern of

commuters. But it is not the only concern.
as Mr. Levenson would have us believe.

He next alleges that the group leas-t~
qualified to represent the commuters and
solve their problems is the Commuter Asso-
ciation. The Commuter Association has
five members on Men’s Council and is re-
presented on President’s Council. Clearly,
his feeling is not shared by others on this
campus who made these provisions for re-
cognition.

Mr. Levenson then refers to our latest
effort to communicate with commuters as
ludicrous and calls the cafeteria issue pet-
ty. ‘

If he has taken the time to prepare ‘and
mail out this type of material to nearly
9,000 students as the Association has. I will
be glad to compare results. If he hasn‘t.
it is clear his allegations are not based on
fact. If he cannot see that lower prices than
the present cash ticket price will bring more
commuters into the cafeteria, the stu-
pidity lies with him and not with the As-
sociation. " Y

The Association is trying to deal with the
parkingproblem. We have had strategy ses-
sions with Mr. Jack Freeman (Assistant to
the. Chancellor) and this.has led. to negotia-
tions with PAT and Mr. Anthony‘Miscim-
arra.

In the other areas of proven concern.
we are near agreement on a limited meal
ticket set-up with Mr. David Ginevan.
Director of- University Housing. Dr.
Critchfield has secured a lounge area in
the Student Union and there are negotia-
tions under way with Mr. John Loch for
more. These facts clearly refute the “do-
nothing” charge of Mr. Levenson. The re-
sults of our poll show almost 80 per cent of
those responding in favor some sort of meal
ticket plan and favor increased lounge fa-
cilities. Clearly. parking is not the only con-
cern of commuters.

By making these frivolousclaims, Mr.
Levenson has displayed a callous disregard
for the facts, something not known to this
newspaper. --

Editor. The Pitt News:

My contratulations to Mr. Bruce Lev-
enson on his column of February 12 entitl-

ed "Commuter Schmuter."

In this article. Mr. Levenson uncovers
the astounding fact that the central issues
confronting commuting students are. sur-
prisingly enough, parking and transporta-
tion. Mr. Levenson further implies that
if the difficulties of commuting could be
reduced, commuters would have'a more
equal opportunity to‘ avail themselves
of facilities on campus such as the Hill-
man Library, Trees Hall. or the Student
Union and participate in activities which
require evenings at school.

As I read, with approval. Mr. Levenson’s
amazingly unique line of reasoning, I be-
came aware that his argument closely par-
a1leled‘(l) an article which I wrote last

fall for the Pitt News special on the “Speak 7

Your Peace” weekend and (2) the thoughts V
of nearly every commuter who inhabits the
Commons Room or Student Union lobby.

I was extremely disappointed to find
that Mr. Levenson did not follow his bril-
liant observation with any sort of earth-
shaking solution. As I recall. Mr. Leven-
son and others have suggested that the City
remove parking meters from Fifth Avenue
or the Schenley Plaza. I

‘ (Editor's note: Mr. Levenson did not
advocate the removal of parking’ meters.)

If such proposals became realities. I
would be willing to bet that by 6:30 a.m.
every available parking space would be_us-
urped for the entire day by students and
Oakland employees — not to mention Pitts-
burgh employees who would park in these
free spaces and take a bus into town.

Consequently, the turnover of spaces dur-
ing the day woud most likely be min-
imal and the traffic u n b e a r a b l e. The
idea of free parking spaces is most, desir-
able. but this particular method of acquir-
ing them is impractical to say the least.
Perhaps Mr. Levenson has realized. though.
tions, particularly in view of the Univer-
sity’s increasing commuter population and
the financial difficulties of the PAT.

‘I have been working with Mr. Anthony ‘
Miscamarra of the City’s Traffic Plan-
ning Bureau for over two years. and any
Small 3m01lnt.0f progress that has been
made has come slowly and not without much

. planning and consideration.

Ntlabati Talks Of ‘StruggleA

“Non-violence is only effective
when the opposition has a con-
science." posed Gladstone Ntla-
bati. exiled black leader from
South Africa who spoke at noon
Friday in the-SU Ballroom. “So
far. peaceful efforts to obtain so-
cial justice have been met by
blood and iron. The time for non-
violence in South Africa has
gonef’

Speaking on “The Ethical Jus-
tification for Violent Revolution
in South Africa,” the black speak-
er traced the frustration that the
black population has felt through-
out its struggle for social equal-
ity. “The British wanted to
change the Black Africans into
Black Englishmen through their
‘tea parties’; and then they would
give them political rights. I would
expect this process to take about
5,000 years." said Ntlabati.

So from 1652 to 1906. the Afri— .

cans fought their "civilizers,"
said the speaker. “And we lost our
freedom and human dignity on
the battleground." he continued.

With the establishment of the
African National Congress (ANC ),
the movement‘ became somewhat
organized, but, according to Ntla-
bati, its methods were not strong
enough. -

The group attempted to obtain
results by presenting petitions and
depositions to the government.
but this approach did not change

2»

significantly the mood of hate in
“the only country in the world
where discrimination based on
color is enshrined in the Constitu-
tion.“

In 1959. a group disatisfied
with the ANC's policy of non-
violence broke away and formed
the Pan-African Congress of
South Africa. The dissenters real-
ized that the struggle for human
dignity in South Africa had to get
off the level of non -violence.
Ntlabati talked about the alterna-
tives to "reasoning with the white
South African government.

“There are four levels of vio-
lence,” proposed the speaker.”

The first is sabotage, in which no
lives are taken. This is what’s now .

going on in South Africa. The
next stages are guerilla warfare,
terrorism and open revolution.”

However. insisted Ntlabati. the
failure of the past methods of the
revolutionary leaders had been
proven only‘ too well by the mass-
acre in 1960 of 20.000 peaceful
protestors and the massive arrest
of its leadership.

The confrontation. instead of
helping to further social justice.
only lead to American business-
men" pouring some 40 million
dollars in aid into the white gov-
ernment of South Africa to save
the falling economy.

ed States are actively participat-
ing in the murder and destruction
of the black community in South
Africa,” said Ntlabati.

This fear of the power of Amer-
ican business interests in only one
of the apprehensions that Ntlaba-
ti conveyed about the role that
the U.S. may play in aiding the
white government of South Afri-
ca.

“The new administration lays a
much greater emphasis on free
enterprise and black capitalism."
mused the lecturer." This "black
capitalism" is a great contradic-
tion: it’s a system that is-working
against everything the blacks be-
lieve in."

Although Ntlabati insisted that
the militants of South Africa are
“pathologically anti-Communist,”

he felt that the U.S. is under the‘

impression that they are Com-
munist and “feels morally obliged
to protect us from being Com-
munist.” .

Part of the problem of misun-
derstanding lies in the fact that
South African guerilla troops are
"trained in the USSR and China
and other African countries.
“But.” explained Ntlabati. "When
one is drowning. he doesn't ask
another person if he is a Com-
munist or not before he accepts
his help."

Another factor causing the Unit-
ed States concern. according to
Ntlabati. is the shooting of sup-
posed non-combatants. like wom-
en and children. However. as de-
scribed by the speaker, children
are undergoing military training
from the age of ten and women
all over the country are being
taught how to shoot. "Thus.
women and children are being
made combatants by the govern-
ment.” concluded Ntlabati.

“The problem with the US,”
lamented Ntlabati, -*“is that this
country has forgotten its values.
The important things here are
wealth, military power, white pig-
mentation, and anti-Communism.
The South African blacks are the
victims of these values.”

The exiled leader identified
seven basic requirements for jus-
tified violence: a just cause. war
as only a last resort. a lawful pub-
lic authority. hope of victory. just
intentions. the nature of the in-
justices being serious enough to
allow for damage done. and a war
rightly conducted through just

He posed that the only alternative 1
left is_ for the blacks to go outside‘

A woman, watching her children vieing for a drink of water,
glanced up and said,’ “We had a good day, today,” after Satur-
day‘s track meet at the Field House. The woman was Mrs. Jim Ban-
ner and she had jsut witnessed a convincing victory by her husband's
varsity thinclad squad over the tracksters from Penn State. The 65-35
triumph was something that the couple had “come a long way for.”

The freshman had a rougher
time; but still won, 52-48.

Yet, the coach, Jim Banner, did
not seem to think that the varsity
victory was as easily gained as the
score would indicate.

“Easy?” he asked. “All the races
were tough; we had to scratch for
them all.”

Nonetheless, eight of the 12 top
spots went to his trackmen. result-
ing in the rather lop-sided victory.
the first for the thinclads over
State in 16 years.

One of the grea_test perform-
ances of the day was turned in by
Jerry Richey. As expected. the
speedster easily captured the mile
event. despite a 4:156 clocking, a
bit slower than his latest outings.

But, a reason for this may have
come to the crowd’s attention lat-
er when Richey ran in the two-
mile competition. About mid-way

through the race a stitch in the
sophomore’s side opened. The pain
was noticeable, but Richey stayed
in the race to capture an impor-
tant second spot. Mark Vornhagen
won that race for the varsity with
a time of 9:22.5.

Richey had to be pulled from the
two-mile relay team though. They
didn’t need him against the Nit-
tany Lions, as the quartet of Greg
Rodgers. Mike Nolan. John Wern-
er and John Aikentwon the race
in 7:46. The milesrelay group also

_ won their chase.

A member of that team, Smitty
Brown, had another successful Sat-
urday. This time he was involved

‘in three wins, taking the 600-yard

dash (1:11.4). anchoring the relay
race. and capturing the 50-yard
sprint. '

The 50 is somewhat new to
Brown; the win came in his first
try at the race since high school.
His time. of 5.5 barely bettered

. teammate Dave Garnett and State’s

Ken Brinker’s 5.51.

“It's the first time since high
school.” Banner mentioned. “but
I knew Smitty would be up there."

Someone else who got “up
there" Saturday was high jumper
Bryant Salyer. Once again, he
equaled his Field House mark of
68' in that competition, and his
leap of 23’1” in the long jump
broke the varsity mark. These were

. the only records set by the thin-

clads in the meet.

However, a Field House mark
was surpassed by a State trackster.

Cagers Outmuscled at West Point

by JERRY L. GRUEBEL
Assistant Sports Editor

The varsity and freshmen hoop-
sters ran into tough defenses over
the week—end and both teams fin-
ished losers as the cagers fell"to
Army, 72-47, and the Cubs drop-
ped another to the Little Dukes.
76-57.

In Saturday’s loss at West Point.
the men of Ridl were rarely in
shooting range of the basket.

“We only took 36 shots.” said
Ridl. “We ‘had 16 turnovers to
their eight, and they had 10 more
offensive rebounds. That pretty
much tells the story.

When the cagers did shoot, they ’

missed. Slphomore shooting ace
Mile.Caldwell poured in 10 of

14 shots from the floor, but the
rest of the cagers hit on only five
of 22 shots—a miserable 22.7 per
cent.

The cager’s poor shooting and
16 turnovers can all be credited
to a sticky Cadet defense. which
at times was too sticky.

"They play an aggressive de-
fense." said Ridl. "They just
grab and hold you, but we knew
about that. Tney got away with a
lot. They physically outmuscled
us. ’ r

-The cagers held the Cadets to,

poor start and a persistent Army
defense/handed them another loss.
For the cagers it was their third
straight setback and 16th loss _
against four wins. ‘

The night before at the Field
House, the Cubs were also im-
mobilized by an aggressive de-
fense. Earlier in the season, the
Little Kukes dropped the'Cubs

at the Civic Arena, but in the re- .

match the Cubs were without
guard Kent Scott and lost by a
bigger margin. '
“It would have been different
defending against Scott,” said Du-
quesne freshmen coach Al Bailey.
Without Scott in the line-up. the
Cubs were helpless against Du-

‘quesne’s ‘press.

_“I thought Pitt would be bet-
ter prepared against the press,"
admitted Bailey, who watched his
boys roll up their 11th victory in
12 contests.

The two bright spots in the
game were guard Steve Lewis
and center Paul O’Gorek. Lewis
paced the Cubs with 18 points,
while O’Gorek chipped in with
16.

The Cubs have a full week to
prepare for their next game
against Johnstown at the Field
House Saturday. but the cagers

The final victory for the thin-

. clads came in the shot put com-

petition where Greg Ellis contin-
ued to exhibit consistent strength
in tossing for 50‘-51/4"

The freshman’ meet was one of

those “down to the wire” contests .

in which nobody knew who would
win until Dorel Watley hit the
tape in anchoring the successful

frosh mile relay team. in the final ‘

event. I

The group’s time of 3:26.5 look-
ed like an easy win over State,
but if one of the'Lions runners
hadn’t fallen on a turn (under the
stands and out of the crowds view)

the outcome of the meet could

have been different.

Bannergdecided, “I knew it (the
frosh meet) would be close. but I
didn’t think it would go down to
the mile relay." The meet would-
n’t have. either. if it wasn‘t for
some great efforts by some of Ban-
ner's frosh.

.Ken Balkey, in particular. pro-
vided that little extra that led to
the win. Balkey. who ran the mile
in 4:45 in high school. took the top
place in that run, finishing in
4217.4. Then, he came back from

-a distant third in the 1000-yard

run to grab second place. Team-
mate Watley won the race, edging
Balkey by less than one-tenth of a
second
