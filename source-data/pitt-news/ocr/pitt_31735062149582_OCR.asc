us hear more in
ggreat music for the orchestra
than we are now able to.” In the

course he will avoid historical data
about composers, discussing only the
analysis of the music.

V.Vhy will the course appeal to its
diversiﬁed students? Dr. Erskine
says that all people have good minds
and music is a universal language.
All we _need is an ear for music,
which, he believes, is the essence of
appreciation.

Mr. Reiner disagreed in part, de-
claring that an open mind and inter-
est are more conducive to true appre-
ciation. He pointed out that “per-
sons not gifted will get something in-
structive and constructive from the
course.”

Rathertlian present a program, Dr.
Erskine has planned to study one
masterpiece each week. His method
will be to have
the selection
played in its en-
tirety before dis-
cussing the dif-
ferent aspects of
the orchestra and
orchestral music.
Following his
analysis, the
composition will
again be played.

Dr. E r s kin e
prophesied, “At
the end of 16
weeks the very minimum value
obtained from the course will bethe
listening. Also, students will under-
stand the orchestra and things said
by the orchestra which cannot be
said by any other combination of in-
struments, the piano, or the voice.”

At one point in the interview, Mr.
Reiner abruptly ended his explana-
tion of the differences between bass
ﬁddles and cellos to look at his shoes,
spattered from the melting snow,
and exclaim, “I ought to have a shoe-
shine.”

Equally informal was Dr. Erskine
who said he’d “try and get by with-
out one” and went on to explain that
“composers don’t toss coins” to tell
them whether to write for orchestra,
piano, or organ.

ductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony,

tivity in the Pittsburgh district
moved slightly higher last week,_ ac-
cording to the weekly summary of
business conditions compiled by the

seasonal, the report stated. The in-
. dex of business rose to 85.3 per cent

only three-tenths of a point over
the week ending November 19.

.to haunt us concerns the question of

‘Pitt’ a gridiron brother, would re-

‘ outsmarted the Carrol goalie to again

tﬁoal
  l

BY LEONARD LEVISON

nos

Sports Editor

As we sit on the doorstep of 106, Cathedral, this morning to await

the ﬁnal appellate decision in the

now well-blurbed “just put your

name down” incident between some ﬁrst semester students and the
Universitv business manager. there are certain reﬂections that come

through the stained glass windows
* -'31

and into our eye.

$

\Vhen We were freshmen the most salient lesson of our composi-

A
?

tion course was, “Never use an ab-_
straction. Use only speciﬁc details”,
Maybe if there were a few speciﬁc
details in every administrational an-
swer, a better understanding of what
is going on, athletically, at Pitt
would be had by everyone.

We are told that the University’s
aim is to play football with ivied
Dartmouth, Cornell and Pennsylva-
nia, among others, as well as the
respected Big Ten. We are further
told that athletic scholarships and
other supporting attractions to tal-
ented athletes have been eliminated.

Now anyone who does nothing but
read Saturday's scores knows that
these desired opponents are anything
but slouches in a football way. And
further, that their gridiron excel-
lency is on the ascent, improving
with each season.

The speciﬁc detail in this case is
“How is Pitt going to secure the
necessary manpower to meet, on
-even terms, these rising gridiron
citadels when the present manner
of administering the University’s
athletics is doing nothing but dis-
couraging able athletes?”

:1: 43 .,.
Standards Vary I
Another impression that rises up

whether or not this courtship will
be successful. Or, still further, are
there not more effective methods of
obtaining this objective?

Even if these other institutions
come to agree that they can ﬁnd
nothing objectionable in the Univer-
sity’s athletic policy is there any as-
surance that they will jump to get on

We wonder whether or not these
Eastern schools, after considering

gard the University as a suitable op-
ponent because of the lack of deep-
rooted traditions comparable to their
own.

=12 :.': :1:
Match For Maroons

With regard to the Big Ten, it
seems that the University’s present
trend will give it a football team that
will only be a match for the Univer-
sity of Chicago Maroons. The boys
at Dr. Hutchins’ Lake Michigan
hang-out, while distinguished above
all others for their scholarship, are
notorious for their competitiv.e record
with their brothers in the pure West-
ern Conference.

In fact, the last time they defeated
a Big Ten football foe has long
passed into tradition. So acute has
this ‘situation become that the Ma-
roons have seriously been contem-

plating severing their Big Ten con-

. nection.

Futhermore, was there anyone
who could have any conscientious
gripe with the schedule that the Pan-
thers played this year? Fordham,
Duke, Carnegie Tech, and Nebraska
seem as attractive to Pitt followers
as anyone it would be possible to se-
cure. And these schools are willing
to meet Pitt any year. ‘

as as at:

One thing certain about this entire
affair is that the boys who are fresh-
man football players at Pitt now, in
the event that they ever develop into
public ﬁgures, will be the most re-
luctant crew that any autograph
hunter ever encountered.

Floor Managers

All basketball managers are re-
quested to report to Charles Was-
sel, varsity basketball manager, this
afternoon at 3:30 o’clock in the Sta-
dium dressing room. -

1 The smﬁ‘ Is There

Playing John Carrol to a 2-2 draw in the first game, of the season,
the Pitt hockey team showed, in spots, potentialities that could carry

it to the league clianipionship.

More balanced and sniootller t

hail the Carrol team, the Panther

outﬁt set the pace for the greatest part of the game.
Clyde Slnring started the ﬁre-works before the game was 30

seconds old. Taking the puck at his¢

own blue line, be split the defense
and beat Goalie Ryan to score unas-
sisted.

With Schooley off the ice for hook-
ing and the Pitt defense having trou-
ble getting organized, Rancourt had
ample time to beat goal tender Ellis
and even up the score.

The 1-1 tie stood until the last 6
seconds of the middle period, when
Artz, taking a pass from Schooley

put Pitt ahead.

The third period was fast and spir-
ited. Schooley made a solo dash that
drew Goalie Ryan out to the red line
to stop a sure score. Arsenault broke
loose only to be stopped by one of
Conick's spectacular dives.

With two minutes to go, Carrol
brought all ﬁve men down the ice in
a now or never attempt to score. The
manuver was successful. Ellis, un-
able to follow the puck in the melee,
was caught off guard by Eddie Ar-
senault shooting from the blue line.
‘The third period ended with the game
tied up 2-2.

The ﬁve minutes overtime period
failed to change the dead-lock, and
the game ended with everyone feel-
ing that Pitt had been held, not
beaten.

Outstanding for Pitt was goal tend-
er Ellis. Playing a smart, wide-
awake game he made many sensa-
tional saves.

On the offense Irv Artz was at his
peak. Skating hard and fast he con-
sistantly sparked the Panther attack.I
On the defense'Right-wings Lowe and |
Brittain constantlv bothered high
‘scorer Eddie Arsenaut and kept him

from breaking loose.

Kappa Sigs Lead
All-Point Race

With the termination of the touch
football season, Phi Gamma Delta
has come up fast on pace setting
Kappa Sigma in the race for the All
Point trophy.

Kappa Sigma
with a total of 238 points and now
has 158 to hold the slender margin
of one point over Phi Gamma Delta.

The Phi. Gams gained an additional’

19 points in the past football cam-
paign to run their total to 157.

The largest single gain in the foot-
ball race was made by the champion
Phi Delta Theta team. The Phi Delts

climbed from ﬁfth place to fourth:

among the All Point contenders.
Starting the present year with 185
points, the Phi Delts now have a to-
tal of 242.

Delta Tau Delta slipped from sec-
ond place to third but is still directly
on the heel of the leaders with 248
points. Pi Kappa Alpha ranks in the
first ﬁve with a total of 232. The
PiKAs dropped from fourth place fol-
lowing the rise of the Phi Delts.

Other scores show Phi Kappa, 210;
SAE, 205: Phi Epsilon Pi, 196; Pi
Lambda Phi, 180; Lambda Chi Alpha,
178; Theta Chi, 170; SAM, 140; and
Sigma Chi trailing with 114.

I The PittNews Sports

By Bill McElwain
Prospective, members of Pitt’s
gymnastics and volleyball teams will
meet in Trees Gymnasium this after-

noon for the initial practices of both
varsities.

Both teams are in the experiment-
al stage, no schedules having as yet
been set up for either one. Practices
will be conducted for several weeks,
and, in the case of volleyball, inter-
squad games will be played, until the
extent of the available material is
ascertained. ' .

Coach Karl Oermann has announc-
ed that all boys interested in gym-
nastics should report at 4 o’clock to-
day, the volleyball artists waiting
until 5 o’clock to run through their
ﬁrst practice under the tutelage of
Charles Radi.

A life saving and swimming pro-
gram, leading to the awarding of Red
Cross life saving certiﬁcates, will al-
so be inaugurated by Oermann at
4:30 o’clock today. The emphasis
will be placed upon life saving, rath-
er than the different styles of swim-
ming.

Temporarily eclipsed by the for-
mation of the two varsities and the
life saving program, intramural ath-
letics swing back into prominence on
Vifednesday with the ﬁrst" competition
of the winter sports program.

Fraternities, engineers, and inde-
pendents are set for the opening, and
have teams entered in all ﬁve sports.
The Fraternity league will see ap-
proximately equal competition on ﬁve
fronts, but most of the ﬁring in the
Engineering and Independent loops
will be centered on basketball and
bowling.

Action will begin at 3 o’clock in
the afternoon and continue until 10
o’clock during _.much of the season.
While Trees Gym will be the scene
of most of the matches, the Stadium
will be used for some basketball
games, and the Strand bowling al-

started this year ~

leys will serve as the battle grounds
for gowlers.

Although the schedules are almost
completed, any team which was un-
able toenter before November 23
may still compete if the entry blank
is received at the Intramural office
sometime today or tomorrow. About
30 teams are expected to be included
in the three leagues.

A Message
From Garcia

Through the recent mails came
a letter to Dr. H. C. Carlson, Pitt
basketball coach, from Jose B.
Garcia, formerly “Pep” Garcia,
1937 varsity basketball center.

Joe, who in Maracaibo, Vene-
zuela is known as Jose, is phy-
sical director of the Gulf Oil Co.
Jose has brought the American
game of basketball to Venezuela
and Jose (pronounced Ho-o-z-ee)
has been lecturing, demonstrating,
and explaining basketball.

The enclosed clippings hail Jose
as an American basketball maes-
tro, which is quite something or
other. They’re even going to put
him on the radio, and when you
lecture on the radio, in Spanish,

about the American game of
basketball, you are indeed a
maestro.

Jose claims that he’s an inno-
tent bystander. A

Olson Requests
More Trackmen

Varsity cinder coach Olson has sent
out a request for all those desiring
to try out for positions on the indoor
track squad to report to him at the
track house any day this week be-
tween. 3 and 5 o’clock. ‘

Candidates need not be experi- .

enced to receive consideration for
any of thetrack positions open.

At present, the world champion
mile relay team of Woodruﬁ‘, Ferra-
ra, 0111, and McKee, is working hard,
hoping it will break several indoor
records this season. A" A ‘

Showing mid—season form in
throwing the shot—put is husky John
Bazyk, University record holder, who
promises to be one of the main point-
getters on the Panther squad this
year. »

Early nomination of a freshman
who will make track history before
ﬁnishing Pitt is William Carter, a
young runner who closely resembles
Ben Johnson of Columbia, former
Olympic star.

scheme here) will have to cope with inexperience and nervousness as
well as a powerful Northwestern ﬁve in its ﬁrst game at Evanston
Saturdayeand coping with Northwestern alone is trouble enough!

The sopoliomore-laden Pitt traveling squad, bulwarked by only
one man who has seen any varsity service, will have trouble getting

away fast this year.
Wildcat squad will be out to even
up the Pitt victory last year.

The series which began in 1927
with a Pitt victory, stands at 5 to 4
in favor of Northwestern. Last year’s
Pitt win broke a sequence. of three
consecutive triumphs by the Big Ten
outﬁt.

After the Northwestern game, the
Panthers will go to Peoria, Illinois,
where on Monday night they are
scheduled to play Bradley Tech.
Bradley is a court power in Illinois,
and this year has a team which will
be tossed in against crack intersec-
tional rivals. '

Bob Johnson, junior holdover from
last year, will be Carlson’s only vet-
eran hand, and Johnson will team
at guard with second year man Jim-

University graduate.

 

November 22, 1938.
’ Dr. Jock B. Sutherland, Coach,

University of Pittsburgh,

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
My dear Dr. Sutherland:

Last February you were kind
enough to respond to a request from
this office concerning an outstanding
§football coach who might be avail-
able for a high school position. You
recommended Mr. George C. Shot-
well, whom we promptly investi-
gated and then appointed to under-
take the difficult task of reviving
football in our city.

It is a pleasure to report that Mr.
Shotwell has far exceeded our ex-
ipectations. He has built up a team
{from mediocre material and has
'.brought them through a strenuous
ten-game schedule in such a manner
that both the players and the local
fans have received great enjoyment
during the season. Thus far East

To The Editor

Through the courtesy of Dr. Suth-v*

Orange has won. seven games, tied
one, and lost one, and-will probably
win its eighth game on Thanksgiving
Day.

Mr. Shotwell’s policies as a coach
and as a gentleman have made him
an outstanding success in his posi-
tion. Not only has the team won
games, but lvlr. Shotwell has won the
respect of the players, their parents,
the students, the faculty, the citizens,
and our opponents. His clear think-
ing, sound judgment, and inspiration-
al leadership are extraordinary. Mr.
Shotwell’s insistence upon precision
and decisive execution makes him
outstanding among the high school
coaches of New Jersey.

We are grateful to you for recom-
mending Mr. Shotwell to us. I am
enclosing a clipping from the local
high school paper which gives you a
picture of the changes which his
work has produced.

Very sincerely,
HENRY E. KENTOPP,
Superintendent of Schools.
East Orange, N. J.

Continuing the policy of creating
new varsity sports at the school,
James Hagan, athletic director, an-
nounced earlier in the week that the
University will have a ping pong
team. i ' L

Last yeara group of students head-
ed by Joe Reiter and Ollie Hurst,
played various clubs around the city
and,went under the school's colors
but had no official sanction from the
University.

Intramural" boss James Potts will
sponsor an elimination tournament
at Trees Gym with the outstanding
four or six men being chosen to rep-
resent the school, Along this line,
the University has previously pur-
chased four new table tennis courts.

All those intending to enter this
elimination tournament are urged to
have their applications turned in to
Potts at this oﬁice in Trees Gym no
later than the deadline on Wednes-
day. Although the tournament may
not start before the holidays, the en-
tries must be ﬁled in order that the
drawings can be made up and out-
standing players seeded.

Due to the opening of the intramu-
ral winter program dealing with bas-
ketball, volleyball, ping pong, hand-
ball, and bowling on the seventh of
December, the elimination cannot
possibly begin until December 12.

THE PITT NEWS

MONDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1938

FROEI many quarters during the past several days have come com-
ments oii the editorial stand taken by The News with the regard

to the present athletic situation.

Interested parties from the newspapers and those directly iii-
volved to the student body and general public have interpreted

The News attitude in different lights.

Some think we are advocating high—pressure, subsidized foot-
ball; others are convinced we favor complete de-einphasis.
circles we are praised for our inquiring attitude, while in others, our
comments are called “unfair” and taken as deﬁnite evidence that

we are at odds with University oﬁicials.

\Ve can hardly blame our readers for being a little perplexed

been presented with sufficient clarity and forcefulness.

This fall, we have been watching with interest the rapid strides

All this, it appeared, was an essential step in :1 de-emphasis

of de-eiiiphasis of football, in the hopes that. education at Pitt may
swing into better balance with the athletic side and thus raise
measurably the academic standards of the University in comparison
with other schools.

Until a week or two ‘ago, we continued to cherish our hopes
that: such a policy was being pursued. Recent events, however,

Brown Study . . .

by Robert Brown

-the French room the fun started.

Well, they are crating up the canvases over at

Carnegie today, and Pittsburgh’s greatest show is over.

On the whole, people were not too startled by this
year’s International. They walked through all the
rooms and had a pretty good time. They could un-
derstand most of the painting. But when they came to
It just seems that
the French are plain screwballs. Discussions result.

The clubwomen, who have gotten along in great shape
up to the French room, cock their heads, stand back
from the picture, look at the guidebook, and then agree
among themselves that the picture has a very deep
meaning. A few young student painters from Carnegie
Tech saunter around, telling each other that Picasso and
Matisse are all washed up.

i A Bewildered Public

The older married couples give up in disgust and go
home to read the paper. The newly married couples de-
cide that it might be easier, and just as cultural, too, if
they were to take a correspondence course in music
appreciation.

There is, I think, a deﬁnite reason for all of this be-
wilderment. The French paintings are so different from
those of the other countries. _

For example, even today, the Dutch are still painting
calm, sober things just as they did in the days of Rem-
brandt. English painting is still very genteel or very
radical in a genteel sort of way. Gaunt, cold Spain is
portrayed by its contemporary artists much in the same

_ manner as El Greco did when he twisted his paints on
' the canvas or when Goya satirized the brainless Castile

kings and the murdering hordes of Napoleon.
But France, seemingly, has always been strongly in-

’ dividualistic, and its artists are the same way. They

refuse to stay in a “school” of painting. It is so much

.- more fun to establish one of your own. Consequently,
i the history of French art is a history of squabbles and

i ﬁghts and factions and schools.

 Good Old Louis

Louis XIV established the ﬁrst “national” school of

 painting. All a painter had to do was to be grandly
j. dull and paint pictures of the king on horseback, the
' king at breakfast, the king hunting, and occasionally :1

.. noble or two.

He was sure to be handsomely rewarded
by the state. .

Watteau broke into this with his marvelous shimmer
of. light and color, and there followed a battle royal be-

-‘ tween the new followers of Watteau and the old “acad-

emy” school. David put a stop to all this nonsense, it
was thought, when Napoleon made him the state paint-
er, and Ingres, the great master of the nude, gave prom-
ise of continuing the classical tradition. Then Eugene
Delacroix came into the picture and established
Romanticism.

In the late 1860’s Manet broke up Romanticism with
a hard boiled lady named “Olympia” who was not
screened behind bushes and bowers, but looked directly
out at a shocked Parisian public. The new realism was
shaken by the Impressionists—Renoir, Seurat, and
Monet. Impressionism was taken over the coals by the
war.

The Paris Cliques

And so we have modern French painting a hodge-
podge of ideas and forms. We have Matisse, emphasiz-
ing line and color, and he has his little clique. Braque,
a Cubist, is still imitated. George Roualt, who did :1

magniﬁcent “Christ and the Children,” for last year’s‘

International, is called immoral by the Futurists, who
could stand some house cleaning themselves yet. Andre
Derain called Cubism “so much humbug” and he paints
with strength and sureness, and does not belong to any
school. And there are hundreds more.

So you cannot blame anyone for being bewildered at
modern French painting. It may be played out or it
may be just beginning a new era. No one knows
whether it will continue to dominate painting as it has
for the last 200 years, or whether the leadership will be
taken by the United States, young and conscious of its
culture as it never was -before.

At least, we should know the answer in about 50 CI
(Carnegie International) years from now.

Richards Predict
As] Aftermath of

s City   Decline

Urbanization

Am

By Ruggero Aldisert v

“If we do not remove the unde-
sirable slums and blighted areas of
our huge cities, it is neither prophetic
nor pessimistic to state that our
monster cities will breed the forces
that will destroy our civilization.”
Such, is the opinion of ‘Wallace Rich-
ards, executive ‘director of Pitts-
burgh’s regional planning associa-
tion.

Mr. Richards believes that these
cities will suffer the same decline as
ancient Rome because of the “tenden—
cy toward over—urbanization.” He
feels that this trend can be checked
by “balanced rebuilding of cities.”

Speaking recently before an au-
dience which included Cornelius D.
Scully, mayor of Pittsburgh, and Mr.
Biggers, national director of regional
planning association, Mr. Richards
traced planned communities from "the
garden of Eden to the Pittsburgh-
Allegheny County Council for Re-

“The ﬁrst step of an approach to a
declared- Mr.
Richards,” is to organize civic groups
into a council or forum as a medium
for correlation between the govern-
ment and the citizenry. Then we
must establish cooperation between
the City Planning commission, the
County Planning commission, the city
and county departments of public
works, the mayor, city council, and
county commissioners.”

_ “The degree to’ which this is ac-

complished will mark_the degree, to
which a planned development pro-
gram for the region can be achieved.”

Mr. Richards also includes in his
tentative program an estimate of the
growth of population within the’ city
and its environs during the past 25
years. He would then sponsor a
complete re-appraisal of all proper-
ties. ’

“But there can be no reality to
any long range plans predicated on a
perpetually shifting millage with a
consequential variations in annual
revenues. No attempts were suc-
cessful to coordinate the construction
program of the city and county up to
this year, which is marked by a re-
markably happy agreement on the
plan for a waterfront boulevard proj-
ect and the Crosstown thoroughfare,”
he added.

“Once this cooperation is accom-
plished we might then include a
gradual elimination of all inappro-
priate uses of land with particular
reference to the improvement of resi-
dential - areas; determinationvof the
most desirable distribution and den-
sity of population from the -point of
View of housing and easy access to
work; an establishment of total hous-
ing needs for all income groups with
automatically an appraisal of the
adequacy of present housing, and
strict control of all the new land sub-
division plus ‘the revision of zoning
ordinances in accordance with future
land use needs determined by the
above steps.” ' - ‘

Antioch Students
,Try Health Plan

An extension of the ordinary col-

lege student health plan calling for _

student health insurancehas been
tried at Antioch college, Yellow
Springs, Ohio.

Instituted more than three years
ago, the health insurance plan pro-
vides that in addition to the regular
medical and inﬁrmary service there
is available to students emergency
hospitalization and consultation with
outside specialists.

Said Antioch’s president, A. D.
Henderson of the project: “This plan
has the double object of ensuring
that Antioch students, especially
when they are away from the camp-
us on their cooperative jobs, will not
delay calling in adequate medical
care in emergency, and that through
the pooling of group resources the in-
dividual will not be forced out of
school by the ﬁnancial burden of
emergency illness.”

Music Organization

PREPARATION FOR HAPPINESS
William Allen White, Emporia,
Kansas, editor:

“Education is a preparation that
helps a man to understand his envir-
onment and to live there happily and
usefully.”

YOU CAN’T WEAR EDUCATION

University of Wisconsin’s President
C. A. Dykstra:

“Education must come from within
you. You must be receptive to it.
Education cannot be poured into you,
nor is it a cloak that can merely be
put on and worn.”

And still the repercussions come dribbling in from
Dukedom in the form of Herbie Hoclistetter, Sam
Cammarata, and Leon Darling who slid into a ditch just
this side of the Promised land, named by the Chamber
of Commerce Winchester, Va. This, men, is
guaranteed as the hostile south’s milk and honey spot

. abounding with “honey chile” and “you alls” and
all the implications that go with it . the aboves,
cheered on by Homer McCliiitock and his Ben Avon
classic, are planning to journey there in May for the
big Apple festival famed for miles about. _

Bud Beachler, late of-the “News,” who has grade-

this is known as freedom of the Press. The hockey boys
are snapping the populace to attention these days by
coining the latest in slogans, e.g., “Don’t eat that grand-
ma,”_which I believe is a direct steal from the C and G
shows.

Leo Griﬂith is hinting about that the next Panther
issue will be peddled by Pitt purties instead of the
mustached or ﬁre-hatted salesman of former days . . .
’Tis also aired that a baby leopard will incognito as

One tall, dark and transient Bob Sully, Duquesne
transfer, hit the Wed. tea last wk. armed by Virginia
Lappe, P.C.W. known-about. And slipping through a
fast deal on our boy Bob, one notorious Marshall Nes-
bitt esquired Ginnie to the tremenjous Frosh Dance.
And inthis line we all grant bows to Bill Allen and his
ace publicity man Jack Stauff . . . for whom I predict

_ a brilliant future here at Pitt.

_T_he deer season was formerly opened by our Leo
Griﬁ'ith, alluded to earlier, when 45 minutes after its of-
ﬁcial unwrapping, this young buck brought down a doe
just to have a little fawn . . . henceforth and forthwith
he will be referred to as Grifﬁth the Deer-Slayer . .
and in this line Irving Bennett is slaying one Merly
Pincus from the woods of Sq. Hill.

“Young Dr. Kilda.ire”—Duke Ellington

They came into sight, half hidden in an amber spot-
light. ' The music was low and on an off-beat, ﬁghting
up_ to a climax. Clarinets, trombones, trumpets took
the melody, wailed it. Fingers on the keyboard picked
out a swift caricature of the tune. Higher and higher
came the notes. Then, ,when it seemed that no {man
could reach for more, the music, bold and deﬁant, end-
ed in a blare of harmonic dissonance.

There was no doubt that Duke Ellington was back.

I have heard orchestras before, but never one that
could combine expression of arrogance, of disillusion-
ment, of expectancy, of joy, with a whimpering back-
ground of the rhythm instruments, sure—and yet, hesi-
tant. ' It is an emotional treat I always‘ await and long
remember; i I ' '

Lew Ayres has bounced back from his “death” in
“All Quiet on the Western Front” to aivery much alive,
alert, and" improved actor. And “Young Dr. Kildaire,”
with accent‘ on the “dare,” offers him ample ‘opportunity
to sink his teeth into something worthwhile.

‘For Ayres, as a young interne in a hospital, seeking
his ﬁeld in medicine, learns to make a diagnosis and
dares to stick by it, even when older and supposedly
wiser men in his ﬁeld contradict him.

The story involves an heiress who tries to commit
suicide. Ayres, working on an ambulance, saves her
life and gains her conﬁdence. He loses his interneship
by not betraying that conﬁdence, and there are other
ramiﬁcations of plot.

And there is a warm personal appeal to all this. Dr.
Gillespie (John Barrymore) the head doctor at the hos-
pital says with a wink, “When I don’t know what’s
wrong with a patient, I give him bicarbonate of soda
and wait and see what develops in the morning.” You
see?
purr inside. See it for a real down to earth, human

characterization.

Penn . . .

“Brother Rat” Priscilla Lane, Wayne Morris

If you are still worried about the depression, or have
a note coming due soon, go take in “Brother Rat” at the
Penn. If you don’t laugh yourself into the middle of
next year, you’re not human.

The laughs are abundant and sincere. The situations
are screamingly humorous. The acting is ﬁrst rate.
And the story, judiciously whitewashed for the movies,
is every bit as funny as the stage original.

It deals with goings on at Virginia Military Institute.
And what goings on! Hazing of undergraduates, break-
ing of regulations, women in dormitories—-but all legit-
imate of course. The women in this case being neces-
sary to help cram some last minute chemistry knowl-
edge into the head of the star pitcher of the baseball
team.

A riot if I ever saw one. Bring out the SRO sign.
Yes, sir! “Brother Rat” is back in town.

It’s the kind of entertainment that makes you 4
