University of Pittsburgh senior Laura
LaFave has been selected to receive the
1993 Marshall Scholarship, which will

the scholarship from 110 students in five
regions across the country.
“By the time they called, I had given
up,” LaFave said. “I was very surprised.”
To apply for the scholarship,_LaFave

wrote two essays, ﬁlled out an application-

glary and current security in
last night’s Open Fomm II,
sponsoredby the RSA exec-
utive council.

“We locked our doors,
but that wasn’t enough 
we want to know what can
be done to improve securi-
ty,” said Michelle Pristash,
whose room was broken
into over the break.

There are no answers as
to the break-in, but the
investigation is still pending,
Housing Administrator
Linda Perkins said.

Perkins said that over the
break campus police will
check the buildings, and it
is not necessary to take ’
valuables home over the
break.

“We’re pretty sure it
won’t occur again,” she
said.

the Honors College helped
her prepare for the interview.

“The Honors College
gave me a mock interview.
They were very supportive,”
LaFave said. “If you ever
want to go for a national
scholarship, definitely go to
them.”

During the interview, a
panel of six people asked the
students questions pertaining
to their ﬁeld of study. “They
just ﬁred questions at me  it
was really fun actually,”
LaFave said. “They asked
very, very good questions.
They asked me technical
points about my area and
theoretical questions about
why we should have a phi-
losophy department.” .

In a press release, Alec
Stewart, dean of Pitt’s Honors
College, said, “Laura is a
remarkable and deserving
recipient of this prestigious
award  She retains exactly

ity that are the Marshall
ideal.”

Perkins and Jo Anne Woodson, direc-

LaFave is the third Pitt Honors College
student since 1984 to be awarded the
scholarship by the British Marshall Aid
Commemoration Commission. She plans
to study at the University of Bristol, locat-

Copy Editor

Following the last Senate
Council meeting, in which the
proposal of granting beneﬁts to
in-house spousal relationships
was supported, the Staff
Association returned yesterday
with ﬁscal and legal issues that
may be involved.

The legal issue dealt with was
whether there will be a risk
allowing unmarried heterosexu-
al or homosexual couples into
university -housing. Same sex
marriages are not recognized by
many courts but Pitt feels it
would be descriminatory to

not married whether they are
heterosexual or. homosexual.
The Staff Association legal advi-
sor is requiring that unmarried
couples requesting these bene-
fits be together for at least two
years prior to applying.

Spousal extras include tuition
benefits, a library card
and bereavement leave time.
The fiscal advisers found
that the cost of spousal beneﬁts

_in terms of taking classes

would be comparable to
faculty attending classes at
the University of Pittsburgh
—— a limit of 6 credits is being
considered. ‘

would be minimal.

The Senate Council received
a letter addressing the burglary
that occurred ‘over the
Thanksgiving holiday in
Holland Hall. The letter charged
that the university has not
responded to the victims’
needs. Attached to the letter
were two—and-a-half pages of
signatures supporting the let-
ter’s request for more attention
to this issue.

“There is an investigation

going on, but sometimes we

don’t move fast enough for stu-
dents,” Vice Chancellor for
Student Affairs William Harmon

Steve Parks of the Graduate
and Professional Student
Association addressed the new
shuttle plan to begin finals
week. He said that it doesn’t
match graduate students’ needs,
but a further study of the routes
will be conducted. .

Parks later‘ introduced gradu-
ate student Mark James as the
president of the Pan-African
Graduate Student Association, a
support group for graduate stu-
dents of African descent. “We
felt we would be able to do
some very positive activities,”
James said. p

Also mentioned was the

Herbert Needleman, who was

accused by Harvard of falsifying 9

research while “he was there.
Last spring the Office
of Scientific Integrity
conducted open hearings to
investigate these accusations.
“We will be in for a bit of unfa-
vorable publicity for the univer-
sity,” said Professor James
Holland, president of Senate
Council.

Friends of Animals said it is determined to educate Pitt students

about the cruelty that animals needlessly endure in the testing of a

Approximately seven members of the club are participating in
telephone telethon today. “We’ll be calling people" on campus to
inform them about cosmetic testing,” club President Michelle Grant
said. ' ‘

Each volunteer will call at least 20 ‘people on campus to inform
them of the companies that still perform animal testing and those -that
have stopped. They want to find out students’ views on other ani-
mals’ issues, such as vegetarianism, medical testing and dissection.

Gillette and Procter 8: Gamble are two companies that still use ani-
mals in testing. Grant said that many people continue to buy prod.—..,
ucts from those and other companies that perform animal testing
because they are either “too busy or don’t understand what’s going
on."

“We have to keep following up, staying in their faces and inform-

 ing them so they can make’ changes,” shelsaid. -

Phi Sigma Pi is a social blend of academics and leadership

By Amy Damn
For The Pia News

Phi Sigma Pi may be- one of
the newest fraternities on the Pitt
campus, but as Vice President
Tom Webster said, “We’ve come

- -a long way, baby.”

This fraternity is special at Pitt
because it is considered a hybrid
social. It is a combination of
social, leadership and honor soci-
eties. ‘ _

“Pitt either has just social or just
honor groups, and this is a mix

of both. That’s what I think inter-

ested a lot of people,” President
Rich Pasquinelli said.

Plans for a Pitt chapter began
this summer when Pasquinelli
and Webster had two classes
together. Pasquinelli had trans-
ferred from Widener University,
where two of his friends had

been mernbersof Phi Sigma Pi.

He became the contact person
at Pitt and was awarded for being
a founding president at the frater-
nity’s national convention last
month

In rnid-September two meet-
ings were held for anyone inter-

ested in becoming a member.

“I’m thinking, ‘Oh yeah. We’ll get

about 20 people,”’ Webster said.
He said he was surprised when

approximately 150 people came

to the ﬁrst meeting and 75 to the

next. “And they weren’t always

with Dear Friends

By Elizabeth Petras
For The Pitt News

Did you ever want to get
away from the hustle and bus-
tle of the hectic Christmas sea-
son and discover the good, old-
fashioned meaning of
Christmas? Well, why not check
out the University of
Pittsburgh's Dear Friends’ 10th
annual Victorian Christmas con-
cert, “A Visit From St. Nicholas
and Friends,” on Sunday, Dec.
13 at 2:30 p.m. in Pitt’s Stephen
Foster Memorial Theater.

The concert will feature Guy
Russo and Diane Owens on
vocals, James Ferla on guitar,
Andrea Doyle on piano and
Jean Thomas, ensemble direc-
tor, on the ﬂute. All are profes-
sional musicians who instruct
in the Pittsburgh area. -

The songs and instrumental
music will depict St. Nicholas,

- Kris Kringle and the Nutcracker

King, traditional Christmas fig-
ures who pre—date Santa Claus
and Rudolph. The earliest
Christmas visitors — angels,

' shepherds and wise men ——

will be depicted in early
American carols from the
singing school tradition.

“These songs are direct, bold

and even sparse,” Thomas said.
“They serve to remind us that
Christmas is not all tinsel and
glitter.” ‘

The audience will be invited
to participate in an onstage
tree—trimming and sing-along, a
Dear Friends tradition.
Ornaments, made by volun-
teers, willbe fruit and ﬂowers,
in keeping with the tradition
that on the night of Christ’s

birth that all the trees in the

forest blossomed and bore fruit.

Thomas feels that one of the .

main attractions of the concert
is how it focuses on the tradi-
tional values and not the com-
mercialized aspect of Christmas.-

"‘Overall, our appeal has

been that people feel they can .

recapture a less hectic
Christmas,” she said. “We’re try-
ing to keep the tradition alive
of ‘people getting together for
the holidays. People feel it’s
less commercial.”

Following the concert, the
ensemble will take the concert
out on the road. It is sched-
uled to perform in Sewickley,

the same people,” he added.

Phi Sigma Pi has 38 chapters
nationwide, and the Pitt chapter of
Alpha Omega has 103 members.

“That has to be the second
biggest social in the Greek system,
and it is the biggest under all acad-
emic groups [at Pittl,” Pasquinelli

_ said.

Next semester Phi Sigma Pi will
be recmiting new members. There
will be a preliminary event Jan. 13
in the William Pitt Union's
Kurtzman Room to meet some
members. Actual rush events will
begin Jan. 19 and will last about 10
days.

Representativeswill be handing
out ﬂiers of the rush schedule and
giving general information at a
table in the Towers lobby from 1.1
a.m. to 6 p.m. on Jan. 8, 11 and
12.

Membership requirements are
simple; a 3.0 GPA is the only set
standard. But during rush “linem-
bersl have to demonstrate that
they’re going to do something for
the fraternity,” Secretary Jennifer
Ilztvis said.

In the short time since its begin-
ning, the club has been involved
in a numberiof activities. In
November, it supported the Pitt

hockey team and volunteered at
the Rainbow Kitchen.

Recently, along with other frater-
nities, it helped at the Pittsburgh
School for the Blind’s Christmas
tree sale fund raiser.

Webster said he was most sur-‘

prised that 19 members showed

up at 8 a.m. on a cold and rainy

Saturday. “Everybody always talks
about how much apathy there is
on campus, but I haven’t seen it.”

According to its officers, Phi
Sigma Pi offers many advantages
to its members. I _

“There is a time commitment,
but as far as comparing it to the
commitment of other socials, I
don’t think it’s as big,” Davis said.

For commuters it is "a perfect
opportunity to get involved, meet
a lot of oeople and get help with
classes,” Pasquinelli said.

Davis said that costs are nominal
compared to a lot of other groups.
“But we offer a lot for the money,”
she added. K p

The fraternity received its formal
recognition from its national olfice
and from the university less than a
month ago. “It’s fun seeing it all
come togetlrerf’ Davis said.

Webster said he has high expec-
tations for the future. “The best has
yet to come,” he said.

Educational reforms

Test scores are spiraling, and American business is
falling into the doldrums. Students’ performances have
slipped behind that of our two major economic com-
petitors. Teenage students now rank around 10th in
the world in terms of math and science. Only 25 years
ago we were number. one.

It’s not surprisingly then that the buzz phrase in this
country has come to be “school reform.” School choice
and pilot programs (innovative schools) are the
newest suggestions commonly heralded as solutions to
this very pressing problem.

However, we think there is a better solution, and this
one will go further than halting the falling test scores
of our nation’s youth. Just last week Texas Governor
Ann Richards proposed a constitutional amendment (to
be decided upon by referendum) which would take a
percentage of property tax from the state’s wealthiest
districts and redistribute it to the poorer ones. As
things stand now, the poorest students in Texas
receive $2,337 per head while the wealthiest districts
spend $56,791 per student. Justa slight discrepancy if
the truth be told. C

The amendment failed by nine votes and therefore
will not go to the voters. Nonetheless we think it is a
good idea. When an education is considered crucial to
move up the socioeconomic ladder, those from the
poorer districts suffer the most. The way things stand
now the status quo is encouraged and the wealthy
perpetuated.

Children from poorer districts rarely gain the neces-
sary skills to function today. Computers, nutrition and
updated books, afforded only by the wealthiest
schools, are the things which are needed most for stu-
dents to gain a proper education. Qualified teachers
would of course all go toward the districts where‘ they
can earn the highest return. Yet many continue to
assert that while something needs to be done about
our public schools, they are not willing to use their
money to do it. C

We know that most people will not go for this plan.
In a practical sense, it does mean taking money away
from wealthier school districts and redistributing it
through some bureaucracy far away. But at a time
when America is seeking the best and brightest, too
many of them are ignored and never get a chance to
prove their capabilities.

An income discrepancy of $2,000 to $56,000 per
head is unacceptable when more education means a
better life and a higher standard of living. It doesn’t
stop there however. Increase the funding to poorer
school districts and watch crime diminish, drug use
slow down and test scores rise. It’s worked in other
countries, it can work here. Let’s give our children a
head start, and let’s start with a fair education for all.

The Panthers dropped their second game in a row

82-69 victory before a crowd of 517 at Fitzgerald Field

'12th-ranked Nittany Lions.

Pitt head coach Kirk Bruce saw his team fall behind
early. The offense turned the ball over on its ﬁrst pos-
session, and Penn State capitalized on the other end-
with a three-pointer by guard Jenny Kretchmar.
Although the Panthers did manage to regain their com-
posure and stay competitive for the rest of the half, this
sequence was a foreshadowing of things to come.

The ‘beat rolls on for the

, team.

Swimming without breast-
stroke attist Don Boyd, who is
out with an illness, the Panthers
were still able to capture the
seventh annual Pitt Invitational
meet as they easily outswam
second—place James Madison
and the rest of the ﬁeld.

The ﬁnal score was Pitt —
899.5; JMU —— 790; Miami of
Ohio — 662.5; Maryland —
361, UConn —- 332 and Virginia
Tech -— 230.

Right from the opening event
on Thursday night, Pitt showed
why it would certainly be the
team to beat in this competition.
Gary Mule got things started for
the Panthers by taking first
place in the 1,650 freestyle
while swimming a personal
best tithe for the event

In the second and ﬁnal event
of Thursday, Pitt’s 800 free relay
team of Aaron Fortner, David
Williams, Jonti Bacharach and
Matt Brady dominated the ﬁeld,

defeating second place James
Madison by over six seconds.
The relay victory would be a
sign of things to come for
sophomore Brady in the next
two days.

Friday night’s first race, the
200 free relay, went wire to
wire in a virtual dead heat. Pitt,
UConn and James Madison bat-

tled from the start, with no ’

more than a few inches sepaiat-
ing any of the three. In the end,
James Madison was able to pull
away for its first victory of the
meet, defeating the Panthers
and UConn by only .04 sec-
onds.

Feasting oﬁ the excitement of
its first victory, James Madison
was able to tie the Panthers
with its second consecutive vic-
tory, as sophomore Mark
Gabiiele posted an NCAA con-
sideration time (which gives
him a shot at qualifying for
NCAAs) for JMU in the 200 but-
terﬂy. Pitt’s Fortner placed a
close -"third for the Panthers.

Something kept Pitt’s starting shooting guard
Ahmad Shareef off the floor Saturday night
against Marshall.

It wasn’t foul trouble, it wasn’t injury and it
was not the performance of any player on the
Thundering Herd. It was his teammate Marlon
Rhymes.

“The only reason Ahmad didn’t get more min-
utes in the second half is because Marlon was
playing so well,” Evans said.

When Rhymes came into the game for Shareef
with 11:48 left in the game, Pitt cou1dn’t shake
Marshall, trading baskets and clinging to a two-
point lead. Rhymes immediately began to remedy
that, slashing down the lane and dishing to
sophomore forward Chris Gant for an easy layup.

Pitt began to slowly pull away by banging on

the inside, drawing fouls and hitting the free

. throws. But it was Rhymes who slammed the

door. He hit nothing but nylon from the three-
point range on two consecutive possessions to

" put the Panthers up 79-68 with 6:05 remaining,

and Pitt coasted to victory.

Rhymes finished with 11 points, including
three—of-four from three-point land and three
assists in 21 minutes of switching between the
point and the wing.

A junior college transfer from Central Arizona,
Rhymes has had to make the adjustment from
being the featured scorer to a bench player bat-
tling for court time. He has also had to find his
scoring chances in an offensive system that fea-
tures the inside game as opposed to perimeter
shooting.

“Down in Arizona, I was the man,” Rhymes

said. “But here I got to get the ball down to the

swim multiple events in a meetlike
this,” swimming Coach Chuck
Knoles said “I wanted to see how
he would swim with a number of
events each night. We were a little
disappointed with his times ... but it
was a good experience for him to
swim this many events in a meet.”

The Panthers jumped right back
on the victory stand in the next
event, as sophomore Brady blew
away the field in the 200 freestyle.
Miami of Ohio’s Joe Douglas got
the Redmen on the board by win-
ning the 100 breaststroke, an event
which is usually dominated by Pitt.
However, with Boyd out with a
virus, the Panthers were no longer
invincible in this event.

“Don is still really sick right now.
I don’t think he’ll be ready to start
training until the middle of
January,” Knoles said. “Your idea of
domination is a litﬂe different when
Don Boyd is not-in there.”

In the next three events, Brady
stepped up big for the Panthers.
He destroyed the ﬁeld in taking the
100 backstroke, and then came
right_back and won the 400 I.M.,
narrowly missing another NCAA
consideration time. Finally, he
proved he is human by ﬁnishing
eighth in the 100 freestyle. Brady-
count — at this point three individ-
ual victories and a relay.

Even though it seemed Brady
was having an outstanding meet,
Knoles said he and Brady expected
an even better performance from
the sensational sophomore.

"‘We were both a little disap-
pointed with how fast he swam,”
Knoles said. “But Matt didn’t swim
this past summer, and there is still a

lot of training coming up. I think
he will have a good second semes-
ter.”

The swimmers then gave way to
the divers, who took to the one
meter board. As he has all year,
Pitt’s Sean Braud showed why he is
an NCAA candidate, winning the
competition. And just like the
swimmers, Pitt’s divers also showed
a little depth as junior Steve Wolfe
took fourth and first-year diver
Jeremy McClean took seventh.

“I am pleased with how [Wolfe]
dove this weekend. He really
wantstto be,a,nat1'onal class diver,

I and he really took control of him-

self,” diving Coach Julian Krug said.
“[McClean] is also showing signs of
becoming an outstanding diver. I
anticipate he will be our top diver
in the future.” 1

Saturday started oﬂf with another
outstanding relay event, the 200-

medly relay. Pitt and JMU battled .

each other from the start, as JMU
was able to kick it in at the end to

grab another relay victory and '

some momentum to start the ﬁnal
night of competition.

Enter Brady. The sophomore
worked his magic again to dorni—
nate the 200 backstroke, throwing
the momentum back in the
Panther’s favor. Brady—watch —
four individual events and. one
‘relay. _

Mule posted another personal

race featured a rematch with JMU’s

' Rich Rowland, who had battled

time, .Mule blew Rowland away by

“Gary did a real nice job this
weekend,” Knoles said. “Iast year
he was so nervous he got sick and

.. couldn’t: swim. But this year was a

different story. He posted four per-
sonal events, winning both the
1,650 and the 500 

By this time in the meet the only
real drama left was whether Brady
could grab his ﬁfth individual victo-
ry in the ﬁnal swimming event —
the 200‘I.M. Swimming with the
chance to break his‘ own meet
record time, this race was no con-
test. Brady blew away the ﬁeld for
his ﬁfth individual victory, just miss-
ing his meet record by 0.8 seconds.
.| The Panther divers put the ﬁnish-
ing touches on the Pitt victory in

the three-meter event. Braud once
again took the title, while Wolfe
finished fifth and McClean .a
respectable seventh.

“Overall I am very pleased with
the performance of our divers,”
Krug said. “Sean really stepped up
his diving in the ﬁnals, with the
pressure on the line: We_are just
preparing to perform well at the
Big Easfs and the NCAA meet. We
still have some work to do to per-
form at the level we want to at the
end of the year.” '

This meet was a sample of what
the Panthers will see later in the
year at the Big East
Championships. Several of the first-
year swimmers got their first real

big-meet experience this past
weekend and performed very well,
according to Knoles.

“I was really pleased with Chris

Perry and Tony Sunseri especially,”

Knoles said. “They got their first

realexpen‘enceinameetlikethis~

and didn’t allow the pressure to
handle them. I am really happy
with the way the young guys did
this weekend

“Overall, I am very happy with
where we are at this point. What
we really needto do right now is
to hold on to the times we swam
this weekend and build on them
fnorn here. What we have to do in
January is hold on to what we
have gained so far.” ‘

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, December s, 1992

that point. Humerich continued to

1 Carry the load for the Panthers

while the Nitrany Lions got points
from Mack and Tina Henry.

“We started with the man—to—
man,” PSU head coach Rene
Portland said. “V(7hen we started
playing zone but they started trying
to take the outside bombers we
switched back.”

The _ move worked. The
Panthers’ ﬁnal lead of the game, a
20-18 advantage at 9:43 of the peri-
od, evaporated quickly as Penn
State went on a 14-4 rim and cap-

basket until 17:58 of the period
At the other end of the ﬂoor, the
Panther defense stiffened and kept

the Lions from having much suc-

cess of their own. But while Pitts
problems continued, PSU began to
pick up its scoring. Only
Humerich's jumpers kept the
Panthers even remotely close. By
the 2:00 mark, PSU opened up_ a
game-high 16-point lead. »
Portland said she was worried
that Pitt’s experienced lineup
would give her team ﬁts, but the
Lions behaved like the veterans as

Everyone’s saying that we’re a great
team  but we’re still not sure
who this team is.” A .
Pitt was hurt by its inability to
convert offensive rebounds into
points. Penn State, on the other

hand, was ‘eﬂicient with its second-

chance shots —— a key statistic in its
victory. ‘ '

“Our offensive rebounding was
terriﬁc,” Portland said of her team’s
22-11 advantage. “Also our foul
shooting [Was strong]. We ﬁnished
early on the. four line and at the

press pretty well,” Bnice said. “On
other occasions we’ got a little timid
in there. You don’t want to throw
the ball away, and you don’t want
to create bad situations. So what I
think happens is that you get tenta-
tive and watch for the defense
instead of seeing where your play-
ers are.”

Humerich garnered game-high
scoring honors, netting 25 point0.

Portland was content with her

team’s defense against the Panthers’
proliﬁc scorer. ‘

Hockey

Continued from page 8
penalties that killed us,
Hockey Club President Mike
Mahoney said. “It’s hard to
play when you’re shorthand-
ed almost the whole game.”

IUP got on the board first
with a power-play goal at
3:11 of the first period,
scored by Jim Atzert and
assisted by Bryan Cikowski.
Pitt answered with a goal by
captain Vic DiSanti (5:46
from Bill Crousey, Kip Linse)
to tie the game.

DiSanti set up camp in
front of IUP goalie Dave
Burkett, while Crousey took
a pass from Linse, went
behind the net and put the
puck on a silver platter for
Disanti, who was all alone to

6‘

‘ tip it in.

With IUP on a power play
late in the first, Panther

Deron Stock beat an IUP
defender to a loose puck
near center ice, walked in on
goal and knocked in the
rebound of his own shot to
give Pitt the lead at 2-1.

Just 45 seconds into
the second period, IUP tied
the game with a power-play
goal by centerman Mike
Heilman, assisted by Dan
London.

The Panthers regained the
lead just 23 seconds later,
when Steve Fisher scored on
a slapshot from between the
circles to make it 3-2.

IUP tied the game at 8:16
of the second, when
Cikowski cranked up a slap-
shot from the left wing circle
that Bratkovich never got a
piece of. A

The Panthers continued to
play strong defensive hockey

and appeared to have the
momentum going their way
when they killed off a full
two—minute IUP five—on-three
advantage midway through
the second frame.

However, with 2:12 left in
the period, Panther defense-
man Mahoney was sent to
the box with a five-minute

major penalty for high stick- .

ing. This‘ was to be the
game-breaker.

On a major penalty, the
player must stay’ in the box
for the full five minutes,
allowing the opposing team
to score as many goals as
they can for the duration of
the penalty.

The Indians
advantage of this by scoring
two goals after the penalty
had carried over to the third
period.

took full

IUP took the lead for good
just 53 seconds into the
third, on a wraparound goal
by Heilman (Atzert,London).
With Mahoney still in the
penalty box, IUP’s Atzert tal-
lied what proved to be the
game-winning goal 45 sec-
onds later, with assists going
to London and Cikowski.

The Panthers climbed to
within one goal with 2:10
left in the game after DiSanti
took a pass from Scott
Giordano and notched his
second goal of the night to
make it 5-4.

After penalties and miscon-
ducts were handed to
Panthers Giordano and Steve
Karas, IUP iced the game
with a goal by Kevin.
McCl-ung (16:04 Atzert) to
make it 6-4. At this point,
Panther Coach Jeff Belle was

ejected after receiving a
game misconduct. Belle also
received a gross misconduct,
which means he is not per-
mitted on the bench for Pitt’s
next game.

The Panthers finished the
first half of the season with a
2-6 record, 2-3 in
WPCHA. Pitt’s next game is
Jan. 9 against the Steel City
Stars, who have already
h'anded the Panthers a 9-7
loss this year. This month-
long layoff will give the
Panthers some time to figure
out what’s going wrong.

“Dave Koval is graduating
 Steve Karas doesn’t know
if he is coming back  so
we are gonna have some
spots to fill, “ said Mahoney.
“But I’m not thinking about
it right now  I really need
this break.”
