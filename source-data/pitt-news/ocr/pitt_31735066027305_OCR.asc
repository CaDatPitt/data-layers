Food, transportation, and gargoyles

Student government fields variety of questions at town hall meeting

"Megan Borolski

 

Everything from safety on campus
to food services to gargoyles was dis-
cussed at last night’s first—ever student
government Town Hall meeting.

Marquette Bowman, Student
Government Board member and the
coordinator of the meeting, couldn’t be
happier about the student response.

“The number of students here
tonight quadruple the amount that I had
at the original meeting I sponsored as a
candidate. I am very pleased with the
student turnout,” he said.

The meeting began with each board
member giving some personal back-
ground information, and stating the
projects they were currently working
on. The meeting then shifted to an open
floor, with two microphones set up for
student questions.

“I think that the board should be
commended for opening themselves up
to the student body for questions,”
President Justin DalMolin said. “We
wanted to be able to sit down with the
students and to talk about what their
concerns are and what they wanted
changed.”

The first major questions con-
cerned the Student Escort Service,
which was shut—down at the beginning
of this semester. DalMolin said that
since the program was disbanded, the

 

Parking and Transportation office has
added an extra van to Van Call and has
recently extended Van Call’s hours
until 5 a.m.

Bob Harkins said the Student
Escort Service was dropped due to lack
of support and lack of use by the stu-
dents.

“We tried out the system for two

semesters, and we advertised it. We just
didn’t have the clientele for it,” he said.

One student asked if vans would
stop to pick up students if ﬂagged
down on the street. Harkins agreed,
saying he will inform the drivers to
pick up extra passengers, if vans were
not already en route to pick up other

Advisors give tips on how to beat the scheduling crunch

$:._laci Mobbvan

 

When most students are think-
ing about ways to keep warm or the
possible excursion sites for spring
break, advisors are thinking about
upcoming scheduling.

Even though a new semester has
just begun, students already need to
think ahead to next fall. In the next
few weeks, students will have to
compete with each other to get the
courses they want and an early
scheduling appointment.

Those with a declared major
have a small lead over the people

WEATHER

 

who need to attend large advising
sessions, but even they still need to
hurry to their department in order to
schedule an appointment.

Students can check in room 252
of Thackeray for the time, date, and
place of advising sessions or visit
the departments of their majors.

Students who have questions or
concerns, or those who are unable
to make the advising session, are
encouraged to call 648-6444.

Following some basic steps
makes the scheduling process less
stressful and intimidating, accord-
ing to Linda Sasso and Beth
Tiedemann, two advisors from the

CAS advising center.

Students must first read the
course description packets. The
packets will tell students if a course
fills the requirements they still
need. It will also tell students the
class size, location, and times for
finals.

Students are strongly encour-
aged to attend their group advising
sessions and to visit their advisors
at least twice during a semester.
Students should write down the
time of their appointments and call
their advisors to cancel if they are
unable to make it.

MEDIA, Pa. — When the opening
statements were heard for his mur-

arrived in a wheel chair wearing a
leg brace. His attorneys said that he
slipped and fell on steps Friday
when he was being returned from the
court to the psychiatric hospital
where he is being held. One year and
one day ago, du Pont killed Olympic
wrestler David Schultz. His defense
is that he didn’t know it was wrong
to shoot Schultz on his 800—acre

NEW YORK — The world’s first
atom laser has been created by
physicists at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. They
believe that the applications for such
a laser could be endless. Atomic

this laser, making them even more
accurate.

’Work on the laser started back in
1995, but no papers will be pub-
lished on the finding until this week.
The finding makes atoms travel in a

Time

Time management is very
important for students. Students
should make sure they have enough
time to get from one class to anoth-
er and time for lunch, if they so
desire. Deciding on class times and
placement can be very important
for students having a hard time get-
ting up in the morning or those with
short attention spans.

Students should also find out
about new programs, learn about
study abroad, and get information
on possible scholarships.

Finally, students should contact

 

the advising center with any ques-
tions or problems they may have.

“No problem is too small. Even
problems not directly associated
with scheduling can affect a stu-
dent’s life and, therefore, their
work,” Sasso said.

Students should think of advi-
sors as liaisons between themselves
and the University community,
Sasso said.

“Even if we can’t solve the
problem, we can put students in
touch with the proper places and
people,” Sasso said.

There wil be a news writers’ meeting

tomorrow at 4 p.m. in the William Pitt Union,  

room 434. New writers are welcome; absent

staff members will be reprimanded with,
appropriately enough, a staff.

Douaihy said she had no

Douaihy had promised to erect

Douaihy said the Cathedral

the best she could do was a
“stuffed gargoyle suctioned to

engineering and related technologies.

One thing that sparked Johnson’s inter-
est in PTEI’s startup was his realization of
the pressures for cost and funding that
future researchers will continue to face.

PTEI is built around a small core staff
consisting of an executive director,
Johnson, and four other associate directors.
Together, the staff coordinates and provides
support for all PTEI activities and form the
primary liaison with researchers and
regional businesses. The PTEI is a collabo—
rative effort between Pitt, UPMC, CMU,
and Allegheny General Hospital.

Johnson hopes to establish Pittsburgh
as a national center for tissue engineering.
He said that he believes Pittsburgh is an
excellent location to start up the PTEI. One
reason he cited is Pitt’s global reputation for
transplantation, and another is that
Pittsburgh has a huge pool of talent in the

'I'I-IE P|'I"l' NEWS

medical and tissue engineering filed.

His associate directors agree.

“Pitt is a major research power house.
Besides being a topranked medical school,
Pitt is also ranked 14th in the nation, up
there with Stanford, and Harvard, in
regards to how much research is going on
here,” said Reed McManigle, a technology
transfer specialist.

PTEI oﬁicials said they also hope to
increase the economic potential for the
region’s ﬁrms that will be commercializing
these products.

“The PTEI is attempting to unite sci-
ence with business development,” said
McManig1e.

While the ultimate goal of PTEI is still
far off, many steps have already been taken
to make these innovative creations one step
closer to realization.

company, Precision Therapeutics, began
operation in July 1995. The company runs
tests on cancer patients’ eells, rather than on
the patients themselves.

A second company, Automated Cell
Technologies, a joint Pitt/CMU start—up, is
currently underway. And a third company,
Ce1lEct Bio, was recently selected as “Most
Likely to Succeed,” at the Pittsburgh
Venture Idea Fair.

In addition to these companies, the
growing attention to tissue engineering
locally has resulted in the attraction of two
tissue engineering companies to Pittsburgh,
including The SoloHill Therapeutics, from
Ann Arbor, Michigan. A second company,
CellSource, is a subsidiary of the Tulip
Company in San Diego, and may potential-
ly be starting up in the Pittsburgh area this
January.

“If you ask me why I am moving to

FROM PAGE 1

Pittsburgh, the answer is simple, there is
endless amounts of potential here,” says
John Johnson, president of CellSource.

So far, the primary funding for the
PTEI has come from the Ben Franklin
Technology Center, a state—sponsored eco—
nornic development program. Funding
from BFTC has provided PTEI with two
seed grants to spin off a number of new
ﬁrms such as Precession Therapeutics,
aforementioned.

“The role of the Ben Franklin Program
is to nurture the development of high—risk
commercial endeavors with high potential
for economic payoff to the region. Tissue
engineering is one of these endeavors,” said
Lawrence McGeehan, president of the Ben
Franklin Technology Center.

The PTEI directors said they hope to
acquire additional funding from local foun-
dations.

Civilian review board
necessary to monitor
police actions

Many Pittsburgh citizens, are demanding that a
civilian review. board should be instituted to monitor
Pittsburgh city police in light of the Gammage case.

We at The Pitt News think this is a great idea.
Those police who conduct themselves honorably have
nothing to worry about and can only benefit from
having a reviewboard to deal with the bad apples who
undermine the integrity of all police officers. Those

/NeKALs

bad apples that need to be weeded from the bushel,
well, let’s just say that it’s about time they had some-
thing to worry about. I

The civilian review board would be responsible
for officially investigating any allegations of police
misconduct. It would have investigational duties and
the power to subpoena, advising responsibilities
regarding the training and hiring of police, and the
responsibility to hand down disciplinary action for
any determined misconduct. The board would give
people a voice concerning the conduct of police. It
would consist of seven members who are citizens of
the city of Pittsburgh and are chosen by the mayor to
serve on the review board.

The Johnny Gammage case was the principle
cause for'the public outcry for a civilian review‘
board. City Councilman Sala Udin sponsored seven

You can -take this as a formal
complaint and sweeping indict-
ment. Anyone who uses the
word “like” more than once in
one sentence is officially a, like,
moron, as far as I am concerned.
It astounds me that in my, like,
English classes, so many people
are unable to express their ideas
without resorting to this annoy-
ing habit. Ifind it ironic that
people in my science classes, on
the other hand, are able to
respond to, or ask, questions in a
concise and accurate manner
without feeling it necessary to
fill out their statements with
umpteen qualiﬁers, ﬁllers, dis-
tractions, security blankets, or
whatever else the word “like”
has come to represent to modern
college students in English writ-
ing classes. Such is the language
of science, perhaps, as opposed
to the science of language.

Strunk and White notes that
“perhaps the most useful thing
to know about like is that most
carefully edited publications
regard its use before phrases and
clauses as a simple error.” Why
has a word that is rendered
meaningless, become so
overused? I don’t know; all I do
know is I am having to physical-
ly restrain myself from scream-
ing in annoyance at those who
insist on qualifying their every
phrase with the verb “like.” '

Unsure of the validity of
their own ideas, perhaps, people
constantly defer to some imag-
ined critic. Perhaps, the profes-
sors are a little intimidating with
their incredibly difﬁcult ques-

desire to have a civilian review board. The first town
hall meeting had 18 speakers with a ratio of 17 speak-
ers in favor of a review board and one opposed.

"In May, there will be a referendum on the ballot
which will determine whether or not the review board
will become a reality. Hopefully, all of the people
who are shocked and dis-mayed by instances of police
misconduct will get out and vote for the institution of
a civilian review board.

 

Like, get a grasp of the language

tions such as, “What was your
reaction to this poem?” I can
certainly understand why one
might wish to hide behind such
responses as, “Well, I was like,
thinking that maybe, like, the
poem was about, like, the sky,
like, as a sort of metaphor for
the, like, emptiness of my, like,
brain.” Yeah. Good point.

But maybe I am being too
harsh on the poor, little, like,
University students. Maybe they
have simply grown up with so
much emphasis on political cor-
rectness that they are having a
reaction. Constantly qualifying
one’s statements with “from my
perspective,” and “within the
dominant culture,” and “speak-
ing as a white male for which I
am so damned sorry, please
excuse me for living” is proba-
bly too cumbersome, and thus
“like” has emerged as a natural
shortcut and defense.
Unfortunately, it also renders
every idea, thought, and action,
imprecise and “wooly.” Now, I
hasten to add, I have no preju-
dices against wool as such: it’s
warm, natural, and cheap.
However, used as padding for
half-baked ideas of PC is plain
silly and promotive of the
sheep-like behavior of unorigi-
nal thought. PC, as far as I can
tell, is a similar concept to that
of affirmative action. The notion
has the best of intentions -
namely, liberty, fraternity, and
equality; however, in practice it
achieves little except greater
division, misunderstanding, and
resentment. I don’t pretend to
know how to achieve liberty,
fraternity, or equality, but I do
know that constantly qualifying

one’s statements with the word
“like” leads to a dangerous brain
condition known as W
for short.

Those of us inducted into
the secret know that this stands
for Wooly, Worthless, Wimpy,
Wafﬂing, and the cure is as yet,
undiscovered. Some believe the
problem is simply one of space;
that is, the overloaded brains of
late twentieth century college
students are simply too full of
other important information
about bus schedules and so forth
to hold even a couple of extra

‘ verbs.

While it is true that there is
no cure, one of the main steps
toward elimination of this sad
disorder is recognition of same.
Fortunately, we have the luxury
of speaking and writing one of
the most common -(I don’t mean
prevalent, I mean common) lan-
guages of the world, and thus,
have not had to bother straining
our brains with an alternative.
The least we can do, as a gesture
of PC to all those poor slobs
who must learn a second lan-
guage, is leam our own lan-
guage well. Thus, as a tempo-
rary solution to the disorder of
Ws, I propose this list of altema-
tives: agreeing, analogous,
appearing, approximate, corre-
sponding, equal, is, perhaps,
possible, probable, resembling,
similar, was.

Thus I end my appeal to the
verbally challenged. Good luck
on your journey towards elo-
quence.

Like,  taylor hopes you, like,
really, like, get the point of this,

of the addition to the Panther varsity line-
up, but they will get yet another chance
next year, as Pitt will ﬁeld a women’s
softball team for the first time in history.

The addition of softball gives Pitt a
total of 10 women’s varsity sports com-
pared to nine for men.

“Right now there are no plans to add
another men’s sport. Title IX says that
there must be equal opportunities for men
and women in terms of participation. It’s
not a team by team case,” Athletic
Director Steve Pederson said.

A campus poll was conducted in
1995 when Pitt was notiﬁed that the cur-

‘ rent balance of varsity athletic programs

wasn’t in accordance with Title IX. This
piece of legislation states that all publicly-
funded universities must have equal

opportunities for men and women in ath-
letics.

“Women’s softball was the number
one sports interest,” Athletic Director
Steve Pederson said, based on a campus
poll. “The addition of softball for women
shows the continued commitment that Pitt
has to increasing athletic opportunities for
women.”

In April of 1995, the members of the
Pitt men’s tennis and gymnastics teams
were notiﬁed by mail from then—Athletic
Director Oval Jaynes that their programs
had been cut. To fully comply with the
Title D( regulations, Pitt added women’s
soccer this fall.

In the campus-wide poll, women’s
soccer came in second behind softball, but
the lack of proper facilities prohibited the
administration from moving forward with
softball. The women’s soccer team shares
time at Pitt stadium during the fall with
the football and the men’s soccer teams.

The newest Panther team will begin
playing a limited schedule in the spring of
1998, and they will enter the Big East in

1999. Conference rules state that a new

A varsity sports team must play at least one

season before entering conference play.
Last year the conference added three new
teams: Notre Dame, Rutgers, and West
Virginia.

The Big East Conference currently
has eight women’s softball teams broken
up into two divisions: North and South.
The North division consists of two—time
defending Big East Champion
Connecticut, along with Providence,
Boston College, and St. John’s. Notre
Dame is the top team in the South division
joined by Vrllanova, Rutgers, and Seton
Hall.

Big East officials have yet to deter-
mine in which division Pitt will be placed.

Last season, Notre Dame went 19-1
in the Big East and 48-16 overall. It won’t
be until 1999, but the Panthers will be
playing nearly 60 games a season.
Currently, there are limited facilities for
sports like baseball and softball. Does this
mean that there will some major changes
in playing ﬁelds as we know them at Pitt?

Pitt baseball Coach Mark Jackson
isn’t worried about the limited ﬁelds on
Pitt’s campus. “I haven’t had any discus-
sions with the Athletic Department yet,
but I’m sure there will be two ﬁelds. Most
schools that have both baseball and soft-
ball will have separate ﬁelds,” Jackson
said.

‘Those are the plans we’re looking
toward. We’re happy to get the program
started,” Pederson said. “We have to go
out and ﬁnd the best place to play the
games. Hopefully we can ﬁnd a place on
campus, but there are no guarantees.”

Now that the team has been born, the
work must begin in setting up opponents
for next year and compiling a coaching
staff that can begin recruiting.

“Carol Sprague has a long back-
ground in softball,” Jackson said yester-
day in a telephone interview. “She has had
great success as a coach, and I’m sure the
search for a coach will begin soon. She’s
an expert in that area.”

Pederson expects to hire a coach
within the next six weeks.

Men's lacrosse not lax
about upcoming season

Eric‘ Mosley _ _

 

Most people would not call a 10-5
season a disappointment, especially for
a Pitt team.

However, University of Pittsburgh
men’s lacrosse club co-captain Pat Shea
feels that last season was a let down.

“Last year was a little disappointing
because we were eliminated from the
playoffs, but beat some good teams like
West Virginia,” Shea said.

Last year’s squad was very young
and lost only one player to graduation;
thus, leading to a season filled with high
expectations.

“The expectations surrounding this

team are very high, a-nd everybody
knows it, especially the league we’re
in,” Head Coach Gary Nest said.
“Everybody is excited, and we have a
good mix of players that can get the job
done.” .
The Panthers begin their season this
Saturday night against St. Vincent
College in Catonsville, Pa. They will
play with yet another young team — a
team with only 5 seniors, a couple of
freshmen, and the rest of the 25 man
squad sophomores and juniors. Pitt will
look to Captains Rob Heapes and Pat
Shea for leadership, and to senior Dave
Travis for strong goaltending.

“This is the best squad we’ve had in
a long time,” Travis said."‘This has got
to be the year. Our offense is clicking,
and we are leaming more and more
defenses. We need to learn more,

 
 

because last year teams knew our style
of play, and this year we plan to throw
them off.”

Senior attacker Marc Polecritti is
also optimistic and added, “We feel bet-
ter about this year’s club than the one’s
we’ve had over the last couple of years.
We are more organized and determined.
Last year we were held back because of
a lack of dedication. This year we are
ready.”

The Panthers play in the National
Collegiate Lacrosse League, which has
85 teams, and only 16 of them make the
playoffs. This year Pitt is hoping to be
one of them.

The Panthers plan to use their depth
this season, something they have lacked
in the past. “We have a senior or an
experienced player that can play every
position,” Polecritti said. “We have a
good goaltender, a good defense, and
Pat [Shea] is a solid midfielder. We are
ready.”

“We’re really looking forward to
the season and to play teams such as
Grove City,” Travis said. “Grove City
has given us some problems in the past,
and we’re looking forward to beating
them this year.”

The Panthers hold most home
games at the Cost center with the excep-
tion of a few games which are held at
Pitt Stadium, weather permitting.

The season runs until mid-April,
when the playoffs begin, and they will
play teams such as Ohio University,
Allegheny College, Duquesne, Carnegie
Mellon, and Grove City.

Piﬂ grapplers set to prove

P-E-ON-N-S-T

Brian Kn

 

 

It is the moral and ethical obligation of
all Pitt students to harbor an intense hatred
for Penn State, and our athletic teams are
given the task of making our little Nittany
Lion fiiends aware that they suck.

While the storied Pitt—Penn State foot-
ball rivalry will be reborn next fall, the
rivalry between the two schools comes out
in all competition. The Panther wrestlers
gets their chance Friday night when they
travel to State College to take on the
fourth-ranked Penn State grapplers.

“Any time Pitt and Penn State get
together, there’s the rivalry factor,” Pitt
Head Coach Rande Stottlemyer said. “It
won’t be easy, but if we wrestle solid, we
have a good chance to win.”

No one knows about the rivalry” better
than Pitt senior Bryan Matusic. He wres-
tled for the Nittany Lions before transfer-

really sucks

ring to Pitt.

“[This match] means a lot to me.”
Matusic said. “I know a lot of people up
there.”

“Even though I’m friends with a lot of
the guys of their team, I’d still like to beat
on them,” he added.

Pitt will have its entire, healthy lineup
ready for the match including Chad J esko
who is nursing injured ribs.

“I’ll be glad to get back in there,”
Jesko said.

The starting lineup for Friday night’s
dual meet will feature Chris Stevens at the
118-pound weight class, Rob Loper at 126,
Jesko at 134, Mike Dixon at 142, Kevin
Johnson at 150, Jacob Schaus at 158, John
Withrow at 167, Matusic at 177, Mark
Bodo at 190, and Rick Vettorel as the
Panthers’ heavyweight. .

Pitt returns home on Sunday to fac
another Big 10 opponent in Indiana at 2
p.m. in Fitzgerald Field House.

Hockey

- The Pittsburgh
Penguins will welcome
back goalie Ken Wregget
tonight when they visit
the Buffalo Sabres.
Wregget has been out of
the lineup since
December 26 with a
severely pulled ham-
string. Rookie goalie
Patrick Lalime will
return to his backup role.
During his stint as the
Penguins starter between
the pipes Lalime set an
NHL record by going 16
games without a loss.

° The Pens will also
welcome“ back Jaromir
Jagr from a sore ankle.
Missing the game for the
Pens will be Joe Dziedzic
(sprained left shoulder)
and Andreas Johansson
(ﬂu).

0 Buffalo Sabres left
wing Randy Burridge
will miss two to four
weeks after tearing carti-
lage in his left knee in
practice.

Jurisprudence

0 A former assistant
to John du Pont, Patrick
Goodale, testified yester-
day in Media, Pa., that he
was with du Pont when he
attacked former Olympic
wrestler David Schultz.
The defense for du Pont
isn’t attempting to dis-
prove their client commit-
ted the crimes. They are
instead claiming that he
was insane at the time of
the murder.

° The closing argu-
ments are over, and the
O.J. Simpson civil suit is
on its way to jury.
Sources say that some of
the jurors have been con-
tacted by attorneys with
offers to represent them
following the trial. No
jurors have been dis-
missed.

head coach of the
Chicago Bears. During
his 10-year stay in
Chicago, Ditka led the
Bears to a 112-68 record

The Pittsburgh Angels women’s rugby
club will kick off the spring season March 15
with a new coach, a new look, and the return of
some of its top players.

Tim Nestor, a former U.S. national team
member, will replace Rob Blackmore as the
head coach of the Angels. Blackmore may
remain on the staff as an assistant; however, he
no longer wanted all of the duties of head coach
because he and his wife, Michelle, are antici-
pating the birth of their ﬁrst child. Michelle
Blackmore has also retired from the sport due
to the pregnancy.

Captain Idi Okilo retums to lead the
Angels, and she is optimistic about the upcom-
ing seasorr '

 
   
 

ttsburgh Angels anythi

  

 

“We did okay last year, and we had a lot of
rookies. They are more experienced now,”
Okilo said.

The team will also be bolstered by the
return of co-captain Allison Moore. She missed
the fall season due to shoulder surgery but is
expected to be back for the spring season.

“She is another quality veteran and gives
us some experience,” Okilo said.

This year’s club features players from Pitt
and Carnegie Mellon, along with professional
women from the surrounding area. The team is
open to anyone over the age of 18, and some
players continue well after their 30th birthday.

Angels President Althea Rodgers attribut-
es this wide—ranging appeal to the lack of other
opportunities for women.

“As you get older, there are less sports for
women  it’s the only full—contact sport [for

THE PITT NEWS

ng but angelic

women] in the US.”

Rodgers also explained the excitement
which fuels her love of the game.

“If you’ve ever played, it’s addictive,” she
said. "The adrenaline rush — the camaraderie.”

That camaraderie is one characteristic of
rugby which separates it from other sports.
After a game, the home team invites the visitors
to a party where food and beverages are pro-
vided.

After spending the day trying to pound
each other into the ground, the teams spend the
night singing songs, drinking beer, and trying to
ease their pain. Rodgers said there is often very
little hostility between the teams after a game.

“You take all your aggression out on the
ﬁeld. You know when you leave that ﬁeld that
you can’t blame anybody else  except maybe
the re  she said with a laugh.

analysis from Terry Bradshaw, Howie
Long, and the staff of Consumer Reports.
Vegas bookies will offer odds on the
most—watched spot, funniest punchline,
and an over/under on the hemline of
Cindy Crawford’s outﬁt for the Cadillac
ad (hint: take the under).

When Pete Rozelle tried to sell this
game 31 years ago, nobody bought it.
When Joe Namath sold it, television are it
up faster than the Blues Brothers polished
off the hot-dog buﬂ°et after the Oscar
Meyer Halftime.

A Steel Curtain, a Super Bowl
Shuﬁle, and a guy named Montana later,
and the game has outgrown the sport. Fox
broadcasting reportedly lost money
broadcasting its ﬁrst two years of football
for the sole purpose of gaining the rights
to Super Bowl XXXI.

They made it up in a hurry, charging
$1.2 million for a 30—second commercial.
The spots sold out months in advance.

The game itself? Well, nobody really
cared. The Packers won their ﬁrst title in
30 years. Big deal.

Bill Parcells took an unknown
Patriots team and traded punches with the
Pack for three quarters. Desmond
Howard made Super Bowl history. Brett
Farve conquered his personal demons and
the entire National Football League on
one Sunday evening about 50 miles out-
side his hometown. So what.

It might be the biggest event in
sports, but the championship of pro foot-
ball is also the only one where people
knowingly take bathroom trips while the
game is on so that they don’t miss the
Dancin’ Bears or the Nissan guy. Water-
cooler conversations the next day focus
less on 99-yard kick returns and more on
soda, cars, covered air—conditioning vents,
and the Budweiser hamster.

Where did the football portion of this
game go? Is it forever lost between day-
long pregames and plugs for the X-Files?

No. If you look, you can ﬁnd it.

Sunday moming at one, while most
football fans were out stocking up for the
evening’s revelry, Fox presented 90 min-
utes of pure football. They turned the net-

. work over to Madden and let him put

together an all-time Super Bowl team.

Ninety minutes of ﬁlm. Lawrence
Taylor punishing quarterbacks. John
Riggins punishing linebackers. Jack
Lambert punishing everybody.

Ninety minutes of proﬁles. Jack
Youngblood, who played Super Bowl
XIV with a broken leg. Walter Payton,
who played the role of decoy in number
XX to help the non—Pepsi Bears win a
title. Namath, who literally gave both
knees (a double-replacement operation
four years ago) to further football.

Ninety minutes of Super Bowl histo— ‘

ry that didn’t involve Dancin’ Bears or
Nissan guys. It was a nice touch — and
