Students Call Crisis

Meetings

Tuesday Rap Session S

Suggests Student Alternatives

About seventy-five students,
faculty and administration mem-
bers attended the Mass Meet-
ing in the Commons Room at
noon on Tuesday. The meeting

was called by a few concerned

students to discuss what "we
can do as students and as other

interest groups" in the Univer- .

sity‘s financial crisis.

Scott Baum was the first to.
speak, Baum explained that the
problem is simply a political
one. Pitt, Temple and Penn State
need money; the State doesn’t

have money, and won't, until a ’

tax is passed.“

“To remain in operation, the
University has borrowed from
Mellon Bank and. Pittsburgh Na-
tional Bank approximately twen-
ty million dollars.’The interest
on this is about $4,500/ day.

"The University has stated
that the traveling expenses, sup-
plies, etc. should be cut to a
minimum," stated Baum. The
University has also stated that
no new faculty members will be
hired, and teaching assistants
are to be reduced to a mini-
mum.“

SG Election

“I will leave you to draw your
own conclusions about whatthis
means to your education," con-
cluded Baum.

A rap session was held after-
wards to discuss different cours-
es of action. A week shutdown
of the University, a trip to Har-
risburg, voter registration driv-
es on campus, and a letter writ-
ing campaign were among the
alternatives proposed. .

Urge Letter Campaign

By JUDY VOLLMER
Staff Writer

Students, concerned about the

Harrisburg Crisis are.busy pro-

moting a campus-wide letter
writing campaign in order to
call for immediate action for
University finances.

Arbitrators Chosen

By DON MARBURY
News Editor

..The Student Government elec-
tion question will be entering its
final stages very soon, accord-
ing to Bernard J. Kobosky, As-
sistant Chancellor for Student
Affairs.

Kobosky said that after the
second SG election last week,
Steve Cundra, USC presidential
candidate, and his campaign
manager John Cavaluchy. ap-
proached him with an appeal to
the Student Government Election
Committee’s SGEC decision.
which stated that Cundra was
disqualified.

Tuesday of this week Kobos—
ky met with Harris Miller, SCU
presidential hopeful. his cam-
paign manager. Sy Adler. and
Cundra and Cavaluchy. for over
three hours trying to come to
some agreement as to how the
long-running SG question should
be resolved.

Kobosky said that he showed
the four students a list of names
of some faculty and administra-
tors. from which to appoint a re-
view committee whose function
would be arbitration in the SG
dispute.

es, ’ Dr. Marcia Landy. Prof.

Richard Seeburger, and Mr.
Thomas White.
Kobosky will appoint these

persons as members of the re-
view committee and will charge
them to decide the following:
Does the SGEC constitute the
legitimate body to make deci-
sions concerning the SG elec-
tion; can this body decide if a
candidate and or elected official
can be disqualified by the
SGEC; and if the disqualifica-
tion of Steve Cundra and Lee
Clabots is upheld. are Harris
Miller and Shep Goldberg the
president and vice president?

The basis for the review com-
mittee's decisions will be Cun-
dra and Cavaluchy's appeal. ex-
cerpts of which appeared in the
Wednesday addition of The Pitt
News, and the stenographic text
of the SGEC which was printed
in its entirety in this Monday's
issue.

Kobosky emphasized that he
had given both sides on the SG
issue a chance to choose their
own student representatives to
the committee. but that both sid-
es declined his offer.

"The important thing." Ko-
bosky emphasized. “is that both
sides have agreed. to accept the

   

feel that letters do work, and
they are being read in Harris-
burg. But we need more con-
structive, critical letters from
students, their parents, rela-
tives, and even high school stu-
dents who are considering Pitt

for college."

Information booths providing
"dummy" letters to give stu-
dents an idea of how to write
an effective letter will be set
up for the next week in the
Towers Lobby, Common Facili-
ties, the Cathedral basement,
Student Union, and the Nurses’
Residence.

Klavonic added. "The letters
should be mailed on Saturday.
and will arrive in Harrisburg on

’ Monday. This will cause a bomb-

shell of pressure on the legisla-
tors."

The Mobilization Coalition
(the Mobe) is not sanctioning an
immediate march on Harrisburg
followed by a University shut-
down. They urge. instead, that
students write letters convinc-
ing legislators of their concern
and ‘of their understanding of a
shutdowns impact.

Steve Rozensky of the Inter-
Fraternity Council suggested
that students write their letters
as voters. emphasizing the re-
quest for full-funding financial
package. Rozensky added, “Stu-
dents should also stress that
a University shutdown would
result in local depression."

"There are so many students
who are unaware of the imme-
diate need for action, especially
in the form of a mail bombshell
in Harrisburg. We're hoping that
the booths will inform the stu-
dents enough that they will ini-
tiate action,“ Klavonic stated.

For those students who can
afford it, the Mobe suggests

.telegrams and phone calls to

 
 
  
  

cal palm

"The state is not hostile to our

education," explained Freeman,

“It's simply the fact that it is an
election year.”

“Why hasn't it happened be-
fore, a student asked in the
question and -answer period fol-
lowing Freeman’s speech. “It
has,“ Freeman answered, .“But
not to this extent."

When another student asked if
all University properties were
mortgaged, he laughed and said,
“Not true."

Dr. Jerome Schneewind, Dean

. of the College of Arts and Sci-

ences, discussed what would
happen if the University is
forced to close.

.."If the University closes and
all of you have to transfer, the
market will be glutted."

“If the University closes;
Penn Sta_te and ‘Temple will pro-
bably also be forced to close.
This will appear in the news,
and not on the back page of the
Post " Gazette. As a_ result, uni-
versities and colleges in Penn-
sylvania will have a hard time
attracting teachers."

Schneewind asked that “stu-
dents use their ability to exert
political pressure by writing let-
ters and visiting their represen-
tatives." He also asked that stu-
dents go home and go to the

Republican headquarters or to . 

the Democratic headquarters
and use their influence there.

"You might be under 21 now,‘

but you won’t always be under R  g

L Boycott Demonstrators

Face Summary Hearing

Thirteen grape boycott de-
monstrators who were arrest-
ed last Saturday for disorder-
ly conduct face a summary
hearing in the Public Safety
Building tomorrow morning at
9a.m. '

The thirteen, who had ga-
thered with other demonstra-
tors in Market Square to pick-
et the sale of grapes, were
picked up in a police patty
wagon shortly before 2:00
p.m.

According to Mrs. Bunny Ar-
nal, the demonstrators were har-
assed by the police in jail. Mrs.
Arnal and her husband, Rever-

end Oscar Arnal, were among_

the grape boycott demonstrators
not arrested.

“Last Saturday there was more
cause for arrest,” said Mrs. Arnal,
referring to the demonstration in
downtown Pittsburgh January 31.

also the hippie - types, those

According to Mrs. Arnal, the f ‘ .

group of demonstrators during
the February 7 protest was com-
posed of mostly priests, nuns,
and ,“middle-class people”. The
long-haired demonstrators were
in another section of the down-
town area with Albert Rojas

during the arrests. Rojas is the S’

head of the grape boycott move-
ment in Pittsburgh. '

..“They were held for better
than an hour and a half before
they were permitted to make
telephone calls,” said Mrs. Ar-
nal. “One policeman made lewd
remarks to a nun, but the de-
monstrators were harassed in
jail.”

The summary hearing tomor-J 

row morning will be to deter-
mine whether or not the demon-
strators are guilty.

By DIANNE ULYON
Staff News Writer

The Japan Committee of the
Asian Studies Program will-spon-
sor a symposium on February
17, 18, and 20 on the Japan-
ese student movement. Noted au-
thorities in the academics of and
negotiations» , with the ‘Japanese
students‘ will participate“/‘in the
panel. discussions with University
professors.

From», late in the nineteenth
century to the present‘ day Jap-
anese students have ‘organized
around a number of local ‘and
national issues to effectively dis-
rupt university and government
operations. The most significant
of these protests was the -1960
/protest in Tokyo against the Un-
ited States-Japanese Security
Treaty. That protest forced the
resignation of Prime Minister
Kixhi and necessitated the can-
cellation of President Eisenhow$
er's trip to Japan.

vide the engineering teacher
research experience in such
health-related areas as phar-
macology. pharmacokinetics.
and physiology. Dr. Win-
gard said the in-depth train-
ing will enable him to bring
a quantitative approach to
problems in biology and me-
dicine. He says contribu-
tions in this field will help
in the understanding of fun-
damental biological process-
es. and application of such-
information} will ultimately
result in better health care:

The three days of panel dis-

cussions will attempt to bring a

perspective to the issues, atti-
tudes, tactics, environment, and
effects of these protests.

Air Concerns

lines in 1965 with the publication
of his book. Unsafe at Any Speed,
which accused the auto industry
of failing to insure safety in its
products.

The dedicated crusader has also
immersed himself in other issues.
He has carried his “safety” cam-
paign into all industries, charging
that most manufacturers defy
minimum safety standards in the
protection of their personnel.

lncluded in his concerns are the
sanitary issues in the meat and
fish industry. the dangers of rad-
iation overexposure in the course
of medical and dental X-rays. gas-
pipeline safety. and environmen-
tal hazards such as air and water
pollution.

Perhaps a New York Times de-
scription best characterizes Na-
der and his accomplishments:
“Many others have shared his dim
view of corporate America and
have expressed their doubts in
more detail and more persuasive-
ly. What sets Nader apart is that
he has moved beyond social criti-
cism to effective political action.“

Indlustriulilsm  

can be ultimately traced to a
conservative influence. or at
least that conservatives acqui-
esce in the existence of these
problems. These are misconcep-
tions. and they must be correct-
ed.

The immediate cause of ecolo-
gical disruptions is industrialism.
which in our society is a con-
comitant of progressive capatal—
ism. Conservatives support indus-
trialism because they believe in
progress. provided that it is care-
ful and genuine. They advocate
capitalism because one of their
highest values is liberty. and
capitalism is economic liberty.
But conservatives do not approve
of license. and when industrial
capitalism manipulates our .re-
sources carelesslyi. it moves into
the sphere of license: therefore
conservatives oppose the excess-
es of industrialism. There is
nothing new about this. Anyone
who traces the development of
modern conservatism will find a

constant and at ‘times despairing
‘outcry against the ravages of in-

dustrialism. Indeed. conserva-
tism arose (with Edmund Burke.
in the latter half of the 18th cen-
»turyi in large part as a response
to the Industrial Revolution and
its consequent dispoilation of the
countryside and its replacement
of the values of. an agrarian eco-
nomy with those of an indus-
trial economy. -

It should also be mentioned
that the environment of com-
munist industrialism is hardly
pure. 1 have read that Lake Bai-
kal is filthy. and 1 have seen the
Danube River called the "cess-

pool of Eastern Europe", Ecolo-

gical problems are apparently
dependent upon the level of in-

dustrialism and technology and

not necessai‘ily upon the l'orm of
economic organization. So the ar-
gument to the effect that ecolo-
gical problems are peculiarly
American or /peculiarly capita-

list cannot be sustained. iE.g..
Mr. Paradises caricature of what
he calls the "vandal ideology“ in
Nation. 29 December 1969. »

Now we know that -the far
left could hardly be held respon-
sible for present ecological pro-
blems — they have neither the
will nor the ability to cause
them — and I have argued that
conservatives are not responsible
either «for much the same rea-
sons». Who. then. are the real en-
emies of the environment‘? The
liberals. of course.

Liberals support industrialism
from an almost insane passion
for progress (never mind where

we are going so long as we are ‘

going somewhere»; they support
capitalism because they will not

slay the goose that lays the gold-

en eggs. which eggs are needed
to finance their socialistic pub-
lic spending programs.

As further proio f of this
charge. I offer the facts that
ecological problems have assum-
ed such serious pr-oporhons, re-
cently because of the dramatic
expansion of the American eco-
nomy in the last decade. and

that that decade has been a lib— .

eral decade: Democratic con-
trol of the White House and of
Congress. the use of expansion-
ist Keynesian economics. and an
increasingly centralized and bur-
eaucratic federal government.

Another way to state the case
is toacknowledge. that while the
liberals haveiproved that they
can "fire up" the economy. they
have also proved themselves in-
capable of controlling it or of

forseeing its less desireable con- g

sequences. .

Having identified the source
of the problem. we can use this
knowledge for the future. But
the problem exists now; what is
to be done‘? It is beyond both
my present purpose and my
competence to make specific re-
commendations. but I should like

to point out that perhaps this is ~

one issue on which conservatives.
leftists. and even liberals—if they
will come to their senses for

Voice From The Ghetto

The "Model Cities”

By RICHARD J. PALAZZI
Contributing Writer
One of the plans our govern-
ment uses to spend our taxes to
improve living conditions in the

. inner-city is something called ur-

ban renewal. Under -the present
"Model Cities" program. huge
sums of money are entrusted to
the mayors of our major cities.
Ideal areas for renovation are
then chosen by the mayors‘ com-
missions. these areas usually be-
ing the teeming slums. A board
of planning and approval is.then
chosen from the people living
in the neighborhood to be reno-
vated. so that they will have
some say as to how the area will
be changed. and to make sure
they aren't "urban renewed"
right out of a place to live.

\ Sounds foolproof. doesirt it -
the neighborhood plans its own
new community. and the city
builds it with federal. money.
But lots of poor people are fight-
ing this plan. There are quite a
few" demonstrations and angry
community meetings over it.
Let's take a look at how one city
bungled "model cities".
you'll know why. V V .
The _neighborlio°od ‘I lived in.

and

  

on Chicago's near north side. is
scheduled to become a model
area for urban renewal. The
neighborhood is inhabited by
Puerto Ricans to the northwest.
Blacks to the southwest. and
poor whites to the east. The
buildings are all very old and
unattended. The site is perfect
for a new community model.

The city officials. however.
feel that if the new neighborhood
is to be a nice one. it should
have not only nice new build-
ings. but also nice new ‘people.
After all. they cant have a lot
of dirty old poor people clutter-
ing up their model community.
So. before any of the poor peo-
pleeven knew what they were
in foi. the neighborhood plan-
ning committee was choseniof
wealthy white Democratic poli-
ticians who live in the ritzy Lin-
coln Park area». the new coin-
munity was planned. and old
buildings began to fall.

Several sharp community ac-

tion groups soon noticed build-

ings disappearing. This worried
them. because a community ac-
tion group isn‘t much if the coin-

__munit_\: is just acres and ..=acres

a while can join forces. This of
itself will not. of course. solve
the problem. but surely it is a
desireable. if not necessary. pre-
requisite. And with the Vietnam
war winding down. and with
some progress being made to
bring into the mainstream of
American life.
been excluded. perhaps agree-
ment on this vital issue can be a
basis for further progress. At
worst. such a joining of forces
should provide an atmosphere

conducive to discussion. a ''low- E

ering of voices" or an “era of
negotiation": at best. perhaps-
just perhaps—it will bring to this
nation a feeling of unity that is
badly needed.

will Concern
For Hungry
Be Forgotten?

Editor.The Pitt News:
I am glad that there is concern

' for the underfed. underprivileged

children of the Pittsburgh public
schools. and I support every effort
that can be made to alleviate their
distress. However. I am ‘afraid

~ thata “quick remedy" such as the

Hunger Week will ultimately

prove to be a more destructive

gesture than is immediately ap-
parent.

It is good that people should get
an idea of what it’s like not to
have lunch for a week. ‘but they‘ll

never know what it’s like not to

have lunch for a lifetime, or not to
have shoes, or sufficient clothing,
or a good school. {'1 they'll give
their four or five dOli rs, and have
lunch anyway, or a bigger dinner.

But think for almoment about
the children themselves, how they
will regard the matter. To them,
lunch for a week will be a treat.
But when the week is over, they
will look back on it as a very. cruel
gesture. Some of them may even

I am not criticizing the concern

Strike Benefits

General Electric Employees Send Thanks 9

Editor. The Pitt News:

We express our gratitude to you
for publishing our letter in the
Feb. 4 issue of The Pitt News.

As an adjunct to that letter. and
in fairness to your readers. may
we acquaint you with the terms of
the final settlement of the.Gener-
al Electric strike. Briefly. they
provide for a 40 month contract.
with general hourly wage in-
creases of 23 cents in the first
_year. 15 cents _coming 13 months
after that. In addition. cost-of-liv-
ing adders will be made every Oc-
tober. Moreover, special in-
creases for skilled workers of 5-
25 cents an hour more take effect
immediately.

At the end of that contract. in
no case should the minimum av-
erage hourly wage be less than $4.
In many cases". it will be consider-
ably higher. Beside these general
wage increases. the fringe benefit

package includes: 100 per cent
coverage of medical expenses. in-
creased pension minimum pay-
ments. and more liberal sick pay.

This settlement seems fair to
all parties. and continues to make
General Electric employees
among the highest paid in Ameri-
can industry.

Finally. in reference to Miss
Millers article. "General Elec-
tric‘s Evil History." (The Pitt
News, Feb. 2. 1970», we cite the
fact that General Electric has
paid out more than $12 million for
Insurance Plan Coverage of em-
ployees while on strike and their
dependants. although the company
was not contractually obligated
to do so. During that period alone.

69.000 medicalexpense claims _

were processed for. payment.

As stated in our previous letter.
we still do not think Miss Miller is
fairly or adequately presenting

The Lessons

In
Handwriting

Editor, The Pitt News:

We are starting a new semes-
ter and half of our problem is to
figure out the professor. My sug-
gestion is to watch his handwrit-
ing strokes and you will have an

. insight into what he is like.

Check his d-stems. If his d-
stems are made with a big loop" he
will be sensitive to any type of
personal’ criticism. You will not
want to directly criticize him, but
rather compliment him, then cri-
ticize, and then cover it up with an-
other compliment.

If he crosses his t-stem to the
right of the stem he will have a
temper and if his i-dots are like
jabs little things will make him

’ "irritable. When crossing his t-, if

the line begins heavy and tapers
off to a knife edge or narrow point
he is sarcastic. Next check his
slant, this will determine his emo-
tional basis. Writing that slants
far to theright indicates a person
who acts quickly to emotional sit-
uations and can be persuaded if
you affect his emotional basis. If
your professor’s writing is more.
‘vertical he will be very objective;
far to the left he will never show
his true feelings.

Finally check his final strokes
on words and if the stroke swings
up away from the base line he will
be kind and generous and will not
mind spending a little extra time
helping you.

These are just a few helpful
hints derived from Graphoana-
lysis, the scientific study of hand-
writing. Graphoanalysis is becom-
ing an excellent tool in personality
assessement of not only our pro-

, fessors, but of everyone who is

able to hold a pencil. Graphoana-
lysisncan best be defined as the
study of the individual strokes of
handwriting to -determine the
character and personality of the
writer. Graphoanalysis is now be-
ing used by teachers, social work-
ers, psychologists, creditors, per-
sonnel directors, clergy, doctors,
lawyers, and many others to help
them understand themselves and
the people they work and live
with.

So the next time your professor
writes on the board or you write
in your notebook check a few of
those strokes and you will have a

, better insight into him and your-

self .»

Academic
World
Is Decrep it

Editor, The Pitt News:

For those of us serving four or
more years of college it is really

encouraging to read statements 33:35‘.

like the one published in the Uni-
versity Times‘ last week: "We
never had any difficulty in placing
our graduates before. and we don't
anticipate any now, in spite of the
fact that the job market is tight.
The students who come here are
good and we give them good train-
ing." _

The person who made this state-
ment is the chairman of the De-
partment of Philosophy. I wonder
what kind of place this is, If all you
get out of the Philosophy Depart-

ment is "good training." what in

,"the.hell do you get out of disci-
plines like education. psychology.
or literature?

Much is said about the hypocri-
sy of the academic world. but how
much of it belongs to teachers and
administrators? To many students

it is revolting and pitiful to see
teachers preaching to us the petty
truths that they have discovered
in'papers" and "articles."
To see them trying to be “hip“ or
“in" is even more saddening. How
many times do we hear them cri-
ticizing the way things are when.
in reality, they are the things and
theirs is the way in which they are
run. ’

Perhaps. we do not-realize how
things are. but unfortunately aca-
demic life is like a septic tank——

the- deeper you get into it. the '

more you stink, and the darker
things get. Those of us that have
just a tiny chance of choosing be-
tween this and "the other world“
really . hestitate after serving
some awakening years.

My father. a member of the
Portnoy generation. seems to be
right after all; there aint no dif-
ference. The manager in our

world is the chairman, the sales- '-

man is our engage teacher, and
silent majority is the stockholder.

What part do we play in this
golden play? We are the people f'or
whom all those brilliant and well-
written articles are published. We
are the people for whom those
beautifully bound thesis are re-

searched and for whom those‘

monolithic prestiges are built af-
ter years of hardship and servi-
tude as Ph.D. candidates and in-
structors. (The punch line of this
tragedy is that we buy all this.

Ridl’ s Squad Prepares For Road

Panther Center

Ending After Disastrous Losses

By ED CON LEY
Associate Sports Editor

Buzz Ridl brings his Panthers back to the
Field House tonight for their final home ap-
pearance of the season in a game -against Sy-
racuse, and the cagers couldn’t have picked a
worse time to look for a good farewell crowd.

The Jungle.Cats lost a home game in the
Civic Arena to the Temple Owls, 101-72, Wed-
nesday night, missing their second consecutive
30-point loss by only one point. They were
smashed by Georgia Tech, 92-62, Monday.

Harry Litwack, the Temple coach, must have
had an alert scout watching the game against
Georgia Tech. The“Panthers were stymied by a

constant pressing defense in that loss, and the

Owls utilized the same defense from the start
Wednesday.

It worked again as the Panthers committed
22 turnovers. More important, perhaps, were the
five turnovers the Cats had in the first five
minutes. They resulted in thegOwls’ break-away
and a 13-5 lead. The Panthers "nevercame close

, after that.
“We shouldn’t have had that much trouble 6

again,” ‘Ridl said. “We were throwing our pass-
es over the top, lobbing them.”

A 50 per cent shooting performance by
Temple and costly Panther fouling prevented
the cagers from cutting the deficit. The Owls’
33-for-66 effort from the field wouldn’t have
provided the trounce, alone, since the Cats were
able to put 30 shots through the hoops. But, 35
successful foul attempts by the Philadelphians
couldn’t be erased very easily.

The Panthers only had half as many at-
tempts (18) from the charity line and connect-
ed on twelve of their free throws.$a

Paul O’Gorek, Mike Patcher, and Jerry Cau-
ser committed four fouls each in the game. And
Patcher sat out most of the encounter after get-
ting three personals in less than five minutes at
the beginning.

The Owls‘ John Richardson enjoyed the
charity bit so much that all of his 15 points
came from the foul line.

All of the Owls weren’t overwhelmed by
the regularity of the visits to the line, though.

Ollie Johnson, in fact, swished as many shots
from the field as he did from the line. His six
successes from both ranges gave him 18 points
on the night. Add 16 rebounds to that and Mr.
Johnson turned out to be the biggest, individual

A problem for the Cats.

Lee Tress, the Owls center, was their lead-
ing scorer with 20 points and Drew Nolan toss-
ed in 17.

“They played one of their best games to-
night,” Ridl said afterwards. “I just talked to

their coach (Litwack) and he told’ me that we ’

hit them on their best shooting night of the
yearf’

There was an unusual name among the Pan-
ther leading scorers Wednesday.

Because of the foul trouble that the Panther

. big men suffered, Jim Tweardy played more of-

ten than he has ever played in one game as a
Pitt basketball player. The weight and height
loss was evident when the 6’5”, 180-pounder
was on the court, but he still contributed 11
points and nine rebounds.

Another substitute, Bob Cizmarik,
nine points.

Kent Scott led the Panther scoring once
again with 12 points. However, all but four of
them came in the final minutes when the Cats
and Owls were trying to the game.

Ridl’s starting line-up tonight’ is almost as
uncertain as it was early in the season when he
was experimenting. He had two new starters in
the Temple game, Mike Riggle at forward (re-
placing Mike Paul) and Mike Leiws at guard
(replacing Cleve Edwards). And the Cats ad-
mittedly haven’t looked good in their latest-out-
ings.

Riggle and Lewis were inserted because of
their play against Georgia Tech when the first
stringer, faltered, and Ridl noted that Edwards’
ankles are aching again. Cleve, it may be re-
membered, had to be worked into his starting
assignment because of pre-season injuries.

Syracuse has been one of the better teams in
the East this season, but they went against the

scored

charging Owls last week and also found them-

selves on the short end of a lop-sided score.

Abrams Scores

    

23; Cubs Wirrz

By BILL NAAB

Marvin Abrams continued his dead-eye shooting,” the Cubs of
continued to contrast excellence with shabbiness, and most}:
importantly the Cubs downed_ the Youngstown JVs Wednesday ‘

evening, 86-73.

-“So many times we look super, but so many other times we look I

dopey. We should have been ahead by 20 points at the half,” Coach‘

Tim Grgurich remarked.

Throughout most of the first
half, the Cubs could not add the
topping to their dessert. They
stole the ball 19 times and also
agitated the Youngstown attack
by deflecting the ball 17 times.
Nevertheless, they couldn’t cash
in on their numerous opportuni-
ties and permitted a— 10 point lead
(With 4:14 left in the first half)
to dwindlel to just a 4 point half-
time advantage, 43-39.

Grgurich could thank Abrams
for maintaining the first half
command. He popped in three
of the team’s final four baskets
and in all contributed 12 points
to the Cubs’ halftime total.

Circumstances had changed
drastically since the Cubs‘ earl-
ier loss to Youngstown: the Cubs
didn’t approach their first game
total of 62 rebounds, nor did they
approach their previous 33% free
throw average. Wednesday, the
Cubs had their best night of the

The wrestling squad has been
plagued with injuries and ill-
ness for the past two weeks.

‘:We are scraping to get guys

said Adams.

Willie Saloky, who wrestles
at 177, sustained a shoulder in-

Adams considers Ben Bishop
to be a tremendous 150 pound-
er, and he adds, “they have two
pretty decent light weights,
John Hamilton and Allan Kopo-

The Big Red boast that their
main strength lies in the middle
and light weights.

Coach Warren Neiger’s gymnasts will try to get back on the
winning track tomorrow night when they travel to New England
to face the University of Massachusetts.

The gymnasts will be shooting for win number three on the

season, opposed to five losses. The latest loss was a disappoint-
ing showing at Slippery Rock Tuesday as the gymnasts scored a

meager 118 points.

According to Neiger. Massachu-

setts will be very tough. "We know

. they‘re tough." he commented.

“We'll have our‘ hands full ‘once

Youngstown Invades Trees Pool

As Tankers Seek Third Victory

Looking for long overdue
third victory of the season,
the Pitt mermen take on the
tankers from Youngstown tomor-
row up at Trees Pool. with the
meet starting at 2 p.m.

This is the first time the mer-
men have taken on Youngstown in
a swimming meet so Coach Grant
has little prior knowledge to go on.
Youngstown beat Grove City ear-
lier this year and presents the
Panthers with the same type of
meet that they swam against
Grove City. Grant puts it this
way: "It will all depend on the re-

well in the in-between races but

Wins Dorm
"'B” Honors

by MARTIN HELLMAN

While the fraternities, inde-
pendents, and engineers have
dominated play in the past
week and a half. the dorm leagues
have wrapped up their season al-
ready.

In "A" League. the Playboys
and Keystone tied with 4-1 marks.
while Sutherland House swept to
victory with an unblemished 6-0
record in "B“ action.

The Stones got into a playoff
berth for the "A" title by downing
Pleasure Palace. 60-43. The.Play—
boys also beat the Palace. 51-37.
and squeeked by Random House.
65-61. to propell them into the
playoff spot.

Sutherland’s championship was
decided in a crucial game against
previously unbeaten Litchfield
Manor, with the score of 51-46.

Fraternity league play was
highlighted by two upsets in "B"
section. Theta Chi scored a big
win over last years champ. PiKa.
51-43. Kappa Sigma also upended
the PiKa's. 55-39. to knock the de-
fending team out of contention.

Kappa Sig won three other
games to take possession of first
place in the "B" section. The vic-
tories were at the expense of Del-
ta Sigma Chi. 58-33: AE Pi. 76-25.
and Theta Chi. 50-45.

The Fiji’s also remained un-
beaten by whipping SAE, 59-35,
and knocking off Triangle, 45-32.
Delta Sigma Chi rebounded from
its loss to Kappa Sig to win three
in a row over Delta Phi, 45-33; over
Triangle, 52-45, and over SAE, 54-
39. AEPi took its first game, 43-
36, over Triangle, while Delta Phi
beat AEPi, 53-32, but lost to The-
ta Chi, 69-35.

Phi Kappa Theta stayed unbeat-
en in "A“ action. with a 49-30 win
over Delta Sigma Phi, and a 66-29
drubbing‘ over ZBT. Delta Tau
Delta stayed close behind as they

we‘ll have to maneuver around a
little to win the relays.“

Grant went with the combina-
tion of sophomores Mark Cohen.
Fred Lewis. Al Morris and Dave
Anderson in the 400 yard medley
relay against Grove City on Tues-
day and then came back with Coh-
en. Rick Rowe. Lewis. and Tom-
my Hays in the 400 yard freestyle
event which decided the meet.
Grant has promised to switch
some men around in the relays but
he will go with essentially the
same men in the individual events.

The hometown fans will get a
chance to see the tankers pitted

against a team that is about of

equal strength as they are. A cou-
ple tankers to key on are Rick
Rowe, sophomore freestyler from
Mt. Lebanon High School; Al Mor-
ris, sophomore breast stroker
from Irwin, Pa., and Tommy
Hays, senior freestyler from Pitts-
burgh.

A big problem the Panthers
have had to contend with all sea-
son is that they don‘t have a real
fast sprinter to anchor thier two
big relay races. The relay is im-
portant because the winner of that
race gets seven points while the
loser tallies a big zero. In the in-
dividual events. points are award-
ed for second and third.

In order to rank Youngstown, it
would be necessary to assess the
teams theyve played. Coach
Grant commented. “I guess Kent
State is the toughest team that
Youngstown swims. Kent is on the
level of Maryland and that makes
them pretty good. Youngstown has
alsoswam against Kentucky. They
lost to both of them."

Unlike Grove City, Youngstown
does not have any outstanding in-
dividual swimmers to depend on
and the outcome of the meet will
depend on how well the two coach-
es place their contestants.

Dave Wessel will be on the div-
ing boards again Saturday with
Chester Zientek backing him up.
Dave has won 10 of the 12 events
he's entered this season with
Chester beating him out in one of
the two he failed to win. Coach
Grant will be depending on both
of them for some fine diving to-
morrow.

FLYING HIGH AT COURSIDE

The Temple Owls weren’t
the only things flying at the Civ-
ic Arena in the Panther loss to
Temple Wednesday night. A
barrage of paper airplanes
started towards the court near
the end of the first half of the
game. With the cagers well out
of the game and the Panther
fans restless at halftime, the

/number of amateur airplane

constructors continued to rise.

The area between the court
and the stands on the home
team’s side was almost blank-
eted with the planes before ac-
tion resumed.

Y Counselors wanted for Camp Somerset for
girls and Camp Cobbossee for boys.
