Students, police start thinking about SempleFest

by Jen Hirsch
Staff Writer

SempleFest, an annual celebra- A
,tion in which students drink, party

and take over Semple Street, will
arrive in eight days, and as of this
week, thevPitt police didn’t think it
was coming. ' _ _

Pitt police Chief Tim Delaney

said he knew Pitt’s ‘homecoming
king, Akere Atte, had applied for a
special event permit to host Sem-
pleFest April 17 (see related story,

' page  But/when Atteprescinded‘
his application after ﬁnding out
-that he’d be held legally respon-
sible for everything that happened ’

during the preiﬁnals festivities,

Delaney‘ said, “I thought there"

INTO THE SUNSET

wasn’t going to be a SempleFest

this year.” - ‘

Delaney, who found out about
the event Tuesday afternoon, said
that because his department has
been busy planning for today’s
memorial for the-three city police
ofﬁcers who were killed last week—.

end while responding to a call, he '

hasn’t met withanyone to discuss

plans for _SempleFest.

. Part of this, he said, also stems
from the fact that “we operate on
a permits basis.” - ' V '

Delaney said as long as students

_‘ stay on Semple Street’s sidewalks,

don’t drink excessively, don’t drink

hiunderageiand aren’t doing other:

wise dangerous or. illegal things,
they can do whatever they want.

During last year’s SempleFest,
64 .people, 18 of whom were Pitt
students, were arrested. 'Ehat’s 20
more arrests than occurred during
February’s post-Super Bowl riots.

Students and business owners
had mixed reactions to the im-
pending event. .

SempleFest best day of

the year for beer sales

SempleFest, page 1

years, is bracing for the worst.

Last year, someone set a Dumpster on
ﬁre outside her house, she said. People threw
beer bottles at the ﬁreﬁghters when they ar-
rived at the scene of the party.

“I’mi against it this year,” said Linn. “It’s
going to be out of control.”

Linn usually parks her car outside her
Semple Street house, but she will keep it
in a garage for the day, which will mark the
fourth annual SempleFest.

Pitt sophomore Rachel Blackburn said
she will also park her car off the street but
still supports SempleF.cst.: .

It’s a tradit1"oin.to have a b1ow—out before
ﬁnals, she said. i

Some local business owners said they also
look forward to SempleFest.

“It’s the most business we do in one day,”
said Campus Deli owner Maurice Nassif.

Last year, the store had to close four
hours early because “students wiped us out,”
he said. _

Jaime Hively, co—owner of Mellinger’s

 

   
   

Beer Distributer Inc., said her company will
be “on the top of our game” that day. She
has staffed additional employees and or-
dered extra kegs and 30—packs of beer, her
most popular items. V , C .

Hively’s mother and store co—owner,
Diana Bellisario, completely supports Sem-
pleFest.

“Of course ﬁres worry me,” said Bellisa-
rio, “but it’s nice to see everybody together.”

To prevent ﬁres, Pittsburgh City Council
banned upholstered furniture on any unen—
closed porch. But some Semple Street resi-
dents have yet to comply.

While some students have recently pulled
their couches inside, evidenced by the gaping
empty spaces and still visible dust outlines
on porches, upholstered furniture pieces re-
main on some others.

The ﬁne for violating the ordinance
ranges from $200 to $500 per day, plus court
costs, and is one more rule by which stu-
dents looking to participate in SempleFest
will need to abide. A

Fraternity seeks recognition

Fraternity, page 1

  

« with “renewed urgency”

N’ ..

Hannah Pilling / Staff Photographer

-The brothers of PiiLambda Phi fraternity’ pose in front of their house, which caught on

fire two weeks ago, on North Dithridge Street.

“[I'he brothers’] spints seemed to be pretty
good,” he said visit with the brothers,
Sanders said it appeared that the incident has not
really affected their academic performance.

“We were worried about the brotheihood at
ﬁrst,” said Cole.

_ Investigators did not give specific details as
to the cause of the ﬁre, which started injohn
Connors’ bedroom, but said it was accidental
and related to an electrical malfunction.

Sanders said although the ﬁre was contained’

to mostly the second and third floors of the
house, early assessments  the damage
to cost at least $40 thousand. I

The fraternity has beeniat the Dithtidgei

Street house since 1922, and the last major reno-
vation was in 1948, said Sanders
“I think we’re on a four— to ﬁve-
month time frame [to get back in the
house]  but obviously some  need
to be brought up to [par],” said, Cole.
Despite not  affiliated direct-
ly with the University, he said, the chap-
ter functions in much the same way as
other recognized Greek organizations
But since he became president, Cole said
is a “renewed urgency behind re-recogni-
Because of its relative separation from Pitt’s
-Greek community, the chapter experiences

more independence but also less social recogni— '
, tion, said Cole.

\While the chapter unofficially collabo-

} "rates with other Greek’ organizations for

private mixers and more open parties, the

last pledge class was considered low, bring-

ing - in about seven brothers, said Cole.

“[Recognition] would just reflect better on

us and Pitt,” said Cole “The beneﬁts of being
separated don’t outweigh the costs”

‘The chapter’s recruitment currently relies‘ on

events like  hookah and house parties,
but affiliation wit:h the University would allow
the organization to take advantage of the larger
Greek networking activities on campus

“We’ve done faitiy, butwe’re absolutely look-
ing forward to [reinstatement]. The recognition"
of the University would be extremely helpful,”
said Sanders ‘ '

Sanders .and ~ chapter representatives have
been  closely with Rothrock and the Of-
fice of Fraternity and Sorority Life since early
March to form an action plan for reinstatement

“Theijlnterfraternity Conference] as an um-
brella organization is completely, 100 percent

' valuable,” said Rothrock.

In order to takejadvantage of IFC resources,
though, the first step is to “establish a 

V relationship,” said Rothrock. ‘ ‘

In addition to the general‘ requirements for
any organization seeking recognition, Rothrock
will require that Pi Lambda Phi representatives
meet _with her on a biweekly basis

Because the fraternity seeks reinstatement
instead of ﬁrst-time recognition, members must
also provide a detailed explanation as to why all
past violations “are ‘no longer a part of the chap-
ter’s culture,” said Rothrock.

The process is not new to the fraternity as

' a whole Other chapters have recently regained '

recognition from their respective universities,
and others have had to start over, said Sanders

1 While one chapter was forcedto close com:
pletely, the fraternitjfs chapter at Temple Univer-
sity is expected to colonize in the coming 

But at Pitt, the chapter has focused on align— —

ing its vision with that of the Greek community,
said Sanders

‘There are major benefits‘ [to reinstatement] ,’ ’
said Sanders “We are really looking forward to
reconnecting with the University and rejoining
the Greek tnmtnunityzé

Pa. Bikini Team interested in site’s parties

McDade said, is Wednesday, when he up-
dates the “girl of the week,” another fea-
ture of the site. ' «
‘So far, he said the girl of the week has
been a friend or acquaintance. The sec-
tion shows a photo and some background
information about the featured girl, like
her major and an embarrassing story.

major featured the first week in March,

participated because McDade asked her,
she said. ‘

The events, McDade said, have started
to increase in popularity, noticing new fac-
es and more people attending. With a $5
cover charge, the events hosted at several
of the participating bars offer two hours
of free beer, contests and giveaways.

Word of the site is also beginning to

"reach beyond Oakland. McDade saidthe

 uxuathr ‘J.:u ilz.w.k.

Pennsylvania Bikini Team recently con-
tacted him, interested in becoming part
of one of his hosted parties. He added
that Miller Light is also now a sponsor
and the site’s ofﬁcial beer.

For McDade, the site is not only a ﬂex-
ible job he can work into his own sched-
ule, but also.acts as an internship that
gives him credit toward his major.

Eventually, McDade said he hopes to

hire other Pitt students as interns to take
charge of other sections of Pittsburgh to
successfully expand the site.

To get the word out about his site,
McDade originally passed around ﬂyers
in the dormitories on campus. Initially,
McDade intended not only to list bars,
but also house parties posted by other
students. _

Resident Life Director Shawn Brooks
called a site like this “potentially prob-
lematic” for the on—campus residents,
because most are not legally allowed to
drink.

“We really are trying to do our best to
have students think verycarefully about
how they choose to engage with alcohol,
and we’re not in a position to promote its
use,” Brooks said. '

Only about 10 percent of Pitt students
living in the dorms are older than 21.

But McDade said the reluctance of
students to post theseparties forced him
to abandon the idea and change his mar-
keting strategy. (

Now McDade said he markets
through word of mouth in addition to a
Facebook group students can join. l

Blair's choice good for 

himself but bad for Pitt .

make the best decision for himself, 2
and according to him, he has al— 
ready reached his highest potential 
playing college basketball. There’s 
no reason for him to wait around 5
for another year and try to carry 
the basketball team without Sam 
Young and Levance Fields. And 
while he would certainly help the 
program, if his personal interests 
lie outside P_itt basketball, it’s his 3 ’
own prerogative to choose where 5 ~

Dejuan Blair was named a
ﬁrst-team All-American, and he
was one of two Big East players
of the year. Indeed, the only title
Blair can no longer claim is that
of a Pitt basketball player.

Blair announced his inten-
tion to enter the NBA Draft on
Tuesday, and on Wednesday, he
announced that he had signed a
marketing and advertising contract
that immediately ends all future
eligibility to play college basketball.
At this point for Blair, it’s the NBA
or bust. ,

Some Pitt basketball fans feel

A understandably upset about his
move. Blair was the most promis-
ing player on Pitt’s hasketball team
in decades — the last time Pitt had
a ﬁrst-team All-American player,
it was Don Hennon in 1958. And
it’s undeniable that Blair’s presence

' on the team was a huge factor in

the program’s successes during the '

last two years.

I Given that, Blair’s decision to
go professional might sting a little.
And there are arguments against
it: If he chose to stay, he would
have had another year to build as
a player and potentially. enter the
Draft with higher stock, not to

mention getting another year of .

college under his belt.
But Blair might have said it best
, himself in yesterday’s press ‘con-
ference: “I had a heck of an indi-
'_ vidual year, just like we had a heck
‘ of a team year. I got All-American.
r I got Big East player of the year.
I was ﬁrst-team everything. When
you have a year like that, then you
don’t need to come back.”
Really, all Blair is  to do is

he wants to play.

Bl'air’s case is a lotilike that

V There is an epidemic of inter-.
E est in the United States. Everyone

cares too much. From foreign wars
to our neighbors’ lifestyles, we have
lost the ability to restrain our inter-
est. At every opportunity to form
an opinion, we do so with reckless
abandon. We needa return to our
right to be disinterested.

Before I go any further, I would
like to  “disinterested.” Suf-

word’s meaning has wafﬂed back-
and forth. Now, most use it to mean
“uninterested.” Why the English lan-
guage would need a synonym for a
word that looks almost exactly the
same, I will never know However, I
am certain that"‘disinterested” means

Much like we have forgotten what
“disinterested” means, we have for-
gotten that we are allowed to be it
A culture of punditry has convinced
us that every social issue demands

 our judgment. As radio shows, Web
2 2.0 and a host of other bottom-up

 

- media seem to imply, every citizen
should have a vehement opinion on

everything from Birthnght to birth

control. A _

V What this creates is something
like a Facebook persona. We all have
our sprawling lists of what we sup-
port. “Students against Fluorescent
 Classrooms,” “Cyclists in
Support of Reaganomics,” “Harry
Potter Fans for the Liberation _of
Palestine.” We all become gross dil-
ettantes and our opinions lose their
teeth as we become saturated with
interest

As technology shrinks the globe, ‘

we ﬁnd ourselves convinced that ev-
ery issue must affect our lives simply
because we are more aware of it.
Everrthe smallest cultural rumbling
in China surely will radiate back to
our lives: the social butterﬂy effect,
if you will. I -

At first, this only seems like re-
sponsible citizenry. How could keep-
ing abreast of world events possibly
hurt us? There is a boldrline, though,
between awareness and opinion.

Consider what it would look like if
we were pressed to justify that every-
thing affects us as much as our impas-
sioned interest would suggest: “Well,

you see,-I care because Obarna’s tax‘

plan will ignite the aristocrats to war
against the middle class, who will be
too'busy  to keep their children
from  away because gay mar-
riage has weakened family values. We
will be powerless to resist because we
have lost the ability to communicate

after we banned couches on porches,

thus disintegrating the fabric of social

connectivity, this entire downward

spiral started by too many people
buying XBoxes instead of PlaySta-
tions, those pillars of familial cohe-
sion. Long live the MacBook Pro.”

No one actually thinks like this.
However, one would hardly be able
to tell we are hot this ludicrous with
the amount we protest, bemoan,
write petitions, editorialize and argue
with classmates.

It’s not that we need to turn a
blind eye or care about each other

less. Quite the_ opposite. We need -

to exert our right to be disinter-
ested while still well-informed. We
are allowed to not form opinions
on whether some event, group, law,
etc. is good or evil. We are scared,
though, that if we do not wave the
banner one way or the other, we
might seem boring, unintelligent, or
disconnected. .

What would this right to disinter-
est look like? Take abortion. I am
neither woman not doctor. I am not
a politician and have not been embry-
onic for some time. Arguably, I have
very little stake in the ‘matter and even
less to say about it that has not been
repeated tenfold before. Choosing
neither echo chamber of pro—life or
pro-choice, I simply abide. There is
never an imperative to adjudicate on
matters, no matter how important

Scientists are not necessarily mad

 
    
 

by Mark Kozlowski .

Colummitt

Every time I’m in a gathering of I

people who specialize in the liberal arts,
whether at a choral convention, debate
tournament or staff meeting for this

ﬁne newspaper, I can always get people -
to look alarmed by simply responding A

to the question, “What’s-your major?”
with the word “chemistry? ’ Their eyes
glaze over inishock and they rapidly
change the subject, lest I burst out in
sonnet or song about the ﬁner points
of nucleophillic substitution.

The sciences, for all they have done

‘ for society, have_a rather mixed repu-

tation. Those who practice them are
portrayed as socially awkward nerds
or “mad scientists” who stand in
the middle of their laboratories with
ominously smoking Erlenmeyer flask
in hand, muttering “With this, I shall

' - control the world and get back at all

those women‘ who have rejected me
over the years!” , .

This portrayal is utter nonsense
The textbook for CHEM 0666: In-
troduction to Maniacal Methods states
quite clearly that “when  dur-
ing a reaction that will rule the world,

it is advisable to‘ keep the reaction ﬂask
inside a fume hood}?

Not only are scientists made to
be scary, but so is the subject they
study. Sure, the public delights in little
factoids like how many arnoebae can
dance on the head of a pin, but go
any deeper, and most people simply
aren’t interested '

i This is truly a shame, for those rr1a-
joringin the liberalarts maynever truly
discover what science majors already
know: There is an aesthetic beauty and
elegance to the sciences, just as there

is beatity and ‘elegance. to a  .

play or novel. _

“But, but, science is so complicat- V
ed,” would be the replyfrom some ..
However,  is  incredible  ' *

that we  the world at all. A
lot of stuff happens in nature, in space
and in molecules. There are 92 natural
elements, each having a distinct sort
of chemistry, millions upon millions
of different species, all in a universe a
size beyond comprehension.

Things have interacted, on this
planet at least, for about four billion
years, with complex life around for
about 550 million. Yet we understand
some of the rules under which all these
various elements "interact, and we can
teach quitea few of them, in very
simpliﬁed form, to schoolchildren via

shows like “The Magic School Bus”

I And that understanding of the
universe, limited as it may be, is‘ truly
elegant. Take, for one small example,

the class used to scare small children A.

who want to be  organic chem-
istry. Mechanistic organic 
can really be compared to ballroom
 some ways: molecules bond,

interchange electrons, break bonds, '
rearrange and_ generally shufﬂe about _

* based on lots of different rules.
Much as there are some moves in
ballroom dance that are impossible,
sub-optimal, or require lots of energy
. to do while others are very easy, the
same is true of . organic chemistry.
And while some hate this subject with
aipassion, I think of it as a sort of
moving—picture show: “Dancing with
the Carbons,” if you will. I
, . But science also has an awful lot
yet to  To take a historical ‘per-
spective: In 1874, Philipp Von Jolly

advised Max Planck not to pursue '

physics because, by his lights, every-
j  had already been ﬁgured out
Jolly turned out to be astonishingly

wrong, and Planck derided up _

~ large contributions, opening the ﬁeld

of quantum physics’ and  the
191 8 Nobel Prize.

“Today, we operate _under no such il-

lusions of  close to understanding '

everything Weunderstand that gravity
exists, for example, but not conclusively
why it exists, or why it is considerably
weaker than other fundamental forces
New and  reactions abound
in any scientiﬁc journal you care to
name, many of these reactions solving

, difﬁcult technical problems Meteorol-

ogyis still rather inexact Oceanogra-
phy is still in its infancy A

 for the philosophically-
minded, science operates on an inter-
esting philosophical construct Theo-
retically, at least, we cannot claim to
“know”  Ideas accepted as
fact are accepted because they ﬁt cur-
rent data and have not been convinc-
ingly disproved yet

Even the most venerable and con-

ﬁrmed theories are not safe. Newtonian '

physics, the last word on mechanics for
more than 200 years, was shown to be
a model that broke down in extreme

circumstances

Einstein is not-a big deal because he
had great hair, he’s a big deal because
some of what he said ﬂew in the face,
of 200 years of scientiﬁc thought and
turned out to ﬁt certain observations .
more exactly. _

So, with that, who’s up for 
that additional science elective?

Far from being callous, the right
to disinterest is a revival of human-
ism. By letting social conﬂict be

in the outcome, we stop reducing

those on Israel, abortion, religion, etc

Just in it for the Music , .

Pop fans nee

by Justin Jacobs
A 09E E3itor

   

Now! 30, as in the 30”‘ installment of
the popular Now T/mtir W//mt I Call Music!"
compilations, was just released and sold 146
thousand copies in one week.

This news immediately brings to mind
two questions. First, how in the hell have 30
of these things been made? And second, who
are the 146 thousand people dumb enough
to buy Now! 30?

The answers to these questions are actu-
ally rather simple, but they point to a deeper

1 issue. Basically, 30 of these compilations have

been made because they continue to sell,
and they continue to sell because fans of
soulless pop music are the most vapid type
of music fan, and hence will buy anything

_ with an exclamation point and a good beat.

But that’s a gripe for a different column.

My real issue with Now! still existing is
that, in an age where we can download entire
catalogues of records in under a minute or
buy individual songs on iTunes, thereby mak-
ing your own bits compilation, this series of
pop song collections is utterly and completely
irrelevant to the music scene.

But it wasn’t always that way.

Now! actually debuted back in 1983 in

_ England as a 30-song double vinyl, but even

then the idea wasn’t new — hits collections .
had existed since the early 1970s. The series
exists in Mexico, China, Czech Republic,
Poland, Portugal, Israel, New Zealand and
Greece, where the title roughly translates to,
“Now These are the Hits Today!” They’ve
long served the purpose of encapsulating
Top 40 radio in one place -— all the catchi-
est pop hits of the last few months on one
record, no waiting around to hear them on -
MTV or the radio. ’ .
Even in 1998, when Now! debuted in the

 

   

d to getvvith
the times and over Now

big, sure, but the downloading scene certainly
wasn’t as saturated as it is today. Looking at
the track list is particularly entertaining, too
— remember “Never Ever” by All Saints?
Fastball, K—Ci & Jojo, Aqua, Marcy Play-
ground and Cherry Poppin’ Daddies all show
up too. Inexplicably, so does, Radiohead.
Seriously, Thom? ‘

In seventh grade, when I was king of the
bar _mitzvah' party dance floor circuit,‘I actu-
ally won a copy of Now! 2 (which included
the New Radicals’ still—underrated “You Get
What You Give”) at a middle school dance
when the announcer asked students to have
a dance-off. And at time, it was a pretty cool
prize.

If I was the same 13-year-old winning

I Now! 30 today, though, I doubt I’d be as

thrilled. With the incredible amount of ac-
cess we have to music, and the fact that I
could burn my own version of Now! from
iTunes, without any songs I didn’t’like, in
a few minutes-, the compilations just seem
unnecessary. 1
Now, by no means do I condone down-
loading mass amounts of music and stealing

from deserving artists, but the songs on Now! 3.
compilations are so ubiquitous in the pop 7, ,
music lexicon they’re basically public prop—  W

erty. Why spend money on a compilation that

has pop songsyou more than likely have on ‘V  - A '  A 1 ’
iTunes already? For the cover art and liner 

notes?

It seems pop music consumers have be- V 
gun to catch on. While Now! 5, to name just ._ 
one, sold over four million copies and Now! 
7 sold 621 thousandcopies its first week, as 
access to music increased, the series’ sales ,
dropped pretty dramatically Now! 30, with 
146 thousand first-week sales, is one of the 

series’ least successful.

Still, folks, come on now. Make your own,
better mixes of your favorite hits. Plus, any 
establishment that wouldput Nickleback on 
a compilation, like, say Now! 30, is one that 

doesn’E deserve your support.

Children with special needs

by Kathryn Beaty
Staff W/riter

Given digital cameras, children who otherwise
would not be able to share their stories have the

~ chance to do so on their own terms, through

their own eyes. .

‘Through Our Eyes: Lifeas Seen by Young
People with Special Needs,” "the appropriately-
named new exhibit at 105 Gallery in Homestead,
features photographs taken by children with spe-
cial needs as part of a project that paired them
with graduate student mentors who visited them
at home and talked about their photographs.’

The project involved ﬁve local families and

, their children with special needs and matched

why he took it.”
Because his brothers would be  nearby

and Monahan would have extended conversa- ‘

tions with his mother, she said she feels she really
entered his life. .

Monahan and her mentee still keep in touch,
and she plans to go with him to his next three-
week transfusion. She said that if he wants, she is
also open to keeping in touch in the future.

Monahan explained that the project offers a
different view on patients’ lives that taught her
about understanding them more as people as
opposed to patients It was about going out into
the community, meeting a family and getting to
know their story and lives and getting to know

them with ﬁve graduate stu— them on another level than the

got going on around them.

educate new leaders in patient— ‘
centered care for children with special needs and
their families.

The children took pictures that documented
the parts of lives that were important to them.
Most of the children included images related to
their disabilities, from their medication to long
clinic hallways, but many of the photographs
were not related.

Darla Clayton, a UCLlD fellow pursuing her
post—doctorate degree in psychology, said that
the 10-year-old with hemophilia‘ and autism with
whom she was paired took about 30 pictures of
his favorite pet guinea pig Squeak, as well as lots
of pictures of buildings and toys.

“I was taken by the fact that he took all these
pictures of  you would expect,” said Clayton.
“He has a disability, yes, but he took pictures like
any other child. He has the same interests, he has
the same passions and he also  a disability. For
me, it was important to think of all kids as whole
people ﬁrst, not focusing on their problems.”

Kate Monahan, a UCLID fellow ﬁnishing
up her second year in Pitt’s doctor of audiology
program, was paired with a 16—year<>ld junior in
high school with sickle cell disease, whom she
preferred not to name.

Monahan said that the important part of the
project for herwas the relationship between men-
tor and child and that the photographs were a
byproduct of this relationship. 1 V

Each weekend, Monahan visited the student
at his house and talked to him about the pictures

Jane Bernstein, a UCLID faculty member an
English professor at Carnegie Mellon University,
piloted the program. She was previously involved
in a similar project at Charles Morris Hall, a com-
munity for adults with neurological disabilities.

Bernstein said that the ﬁrst photographer she
knows to experiment with this type of projectwas
Wendy Ewald, a camp counselor in Labrador,
Canada, in the l96’s. C

Ewald introduced the Polaroid camera to the
camp’s lnnu youth population and had great suc-

cess Today, international organization PhotoVoice '

introduces similar projects all over the world, with
the intent of  people who are traditionally
the subjects of works to become the creators.
“It’s a means for people to depict their lives,”
says Bernstein, “and this issue of people who are
marginalized or disenfranchised tends to be an
important element, because instead of ofﬁcials

describing their lives and  about what they U

need, what they want or issues in their communi-
ties, they have the means to depict their lives.”
As the mother of a grown adult with devel-
opmental disabilities, Bernstein explained that for
parents, the exhibitwas something that validated
their children, who are often devalued because of
their disabilities, and gave them a way to com-
municate their lives. ’ A
Monahan agreed and said that her subject
discovered he could get his story out there and
use it to affect other people’s lives VV1th his as-
pirations to work in television, said Monahan, it

was especially exciting for him to discover’ this .

Seniof Staff [Writer

Ah, Masters time,'Re_minds me of my all-
iime favorite golf moments:

3. Playing the front nine at a local munic-

. ipal course in what had to be eighth or ninth

grade. I had to borrow three golf balls from
my friend Steve, who also lent me his clubs.
Midway through the round,‘ I haul off and

’ slice one that ﬂew probably 200 yards to the

right, down a steep slope. “You’re goingto
get that,” Steve says. He tees up and hits an

' identical "shot that also disappears ‘down the
hill. “OK, we’re not going to ‘get those,” he

says and marches proudly down the fairway.

2. My ﬁrst time playing a full 18 on a for~
real golf course, _Oyster Reef Golf Club in
Hilton Head, S.C. The only club that wasn’t
an iron that I hit straight at the range all

’ morning was the hybrid that came with my

set. I ﬁgured that’s a sign. , .

So the starter drops us off at the tee box

on No. 9, and my friend Pat drives one right
down the middle of the fairway I’m up and
reach for the hybrid. The starter stands and
watches from the right. I take a deep breath,
crank back and shank it right atithe starter’s
feet. He jumps, the ball whizzes by his leg,
smacks against the shack and loses itself into

the bushes. My three friends erupt laughing. A

I say I’ll just drop it when we get down the
fairway. ,.
1. Playing at a par—3 in middle school. I’m
with my friends Dave and Tim playing with
cheap rental clubs that we’re expected to re’-
turn. I feel ambitious on the seventh, which
is probably a whole 90 yards uphill. Iilook
back at them behind me. “I’m going to hit
it hard,” I say. I wind back, andijustbefore I
get to the ball, Dave tosses his club in front
of mine. I snap it in half with the swing.
We decide that we need to get rid of the
evidence, so Tim‘ hits one into the woods
 fakes like he’s going to ﬁnd his ball, only
to throw the broken club away. We ﬁnish the
round, leave the clubs against the shack and
run away down the road. For ice cream.‘

was getting booed because he was always

over to the announcer’s table and says into

smacked him down and grabbed the micro-

Pitt guard Shavonte Zellous will be the Panthers’ first-ever women's basketball player

drafted to the WNBA.

Zellous is a ﬂat out scorer and would compliment

Shavonte, however, is just  to wait until her
name is called before she starts  those kinds
of predictions '

“I don’t pay attention,” said Shavonte when
asked about mock drafts “I’d just rather not know
I know for a fact that I’m  first round, but I’m
just ready to play and meet my new teammates.”

In her time at Pitt, Zellous became the -first

But she doesn’t want any of this to end

“I want to make -an impact {in the,WNBA]
right away and do the same as I’ve done for Pitt,”
said Zellous “I don’t just want to be a rookie that
they drafted.” '

Zellous has a few connections in the WNBA
already — she grew up in the same Florida neigh-

Though she doesn’t know her, Zellous says
that she has always looked up to and modeled her

the Detroit Shock, and would love to meet or play

alongside her

Regardless of her connections and inﬂuences,
Zellous will  happy after Thursday

“It doesn’t matter to me where I end up,
