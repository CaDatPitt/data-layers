Board presidential
candidates debate    

By Frances Sansig
Managing Editor -

Candidates for Student Govern-
ment Board president participat-
ed in an open debate last night to
discuss issues relevant to the
duties of Board president.‘

Craig Jackson and Robert A.
Reddy were asked 11 questions
by moderator and current SGB«
president, Phil Mayer, and were
permitted 3 .minutes to reply and
allotted 2 minutes for a rebuttal.

Both candidates agreed that the
role of the Student Government
Board was to be a representative
body to the students of the
university. '

”| feel that first, and most im-
portant is for the board to be in

said Reddy.
According to Jackson, the role

leader of the board, ”which en—
tails being a leader of the univer-
sity,” to which Reddy replied: ’’I.
do feel the SGB is the most
responsible [organization] to stu-
dents and administration. Over-

 

touch with the student body,”

of the SGB president is to be the,"

all, the SGB president is the

person to shoulder this responsi- V

bility.” J _
Both candidates wereasked to

address the primary concerns of 
Pitt students today. Jackson said’ . .5 i
there is is need for better securi-—.

ty, more facilities — ”Trees Hall‘ 1 
needs to be renovated” — ‘com? V 

puter needs, and the need for

more lobbying in Harrisburg to‘

battle rising tuition rates at pub-
lic universities. ‘ '

Reddy said, ”theisecurity issued
is one of our major problems  -5

computers are our next major
problem.” Reddy stated,

however, that more computer"
time does not translate into more ..

time, but more computers. Red-
dy alsorsaid parking is a major

problem confronting commuting '

students.

Each candidate discussed the“
role of the Allocations Commit- V ‘

.‘.

tee. Jackson said he, feels one

problem that currently exists in _

the allocations procedure is the

lack of communication between ~

organizations and liasons, and
both candidates suggested .im-

proving that particular problem. ‘

Professor addresses black leadership

By William Young.

Assistant News Editor

Dr. Jack Daniel,» associate provost of un-
dergraduate programs, spoke at the Black
Action Society's third general body meet-
ing last night and addressed the problems

of Black leadership and organization.

He stated that groups such as the BAS

- ”spend so much time organizing” that

they never get organized. He stressed
three primary reasons for the disorgani-
zation of Black groups at all levels of
society. ’

”Jea|ousy will destroy (Blacks) either
collectively or individually,”Daniel said.

New fine formilkcrate thefts  

Daniel asserted that jealousy among
Blacks only hurts the Black people as a
race and that Blacks can not afford to be
envious of other Blacks because it affects
their ability to be productive.

The second reason Daniel pointed out
for inefficiency among Blacks was ig-
norance. '

”There are Blacks that think punctuali-
ty is counter to Black culture, so they're
always showing up late forclass or late
for meetings,” Daniel stated. ”lgnorant
people who think studyinghard is ‘ef-
feminate. Ignorant people think science
and technology is a white field. Ignorant
people believe that a ’C’ grade is ac-

ceptable.”_ _

”lgnorance can destroy Black unity,”
Daniel said. ”When the leadership is ig-
norant it destroys unity. Ignorant Blacks
will defend White racism, or defend
Judge Bork, or even put up with what's
going on in South Africa.”

The third problem Daniel stressed was
that of vanity in many forms. Daniel stat-
ed that there are too many Blacks who
want things to get done but refuse to do
the work. .

He also pointed out that there were to
many people who ”are all talk but don't
do anything.”

He also stressed that White racism was

Pitt students may be ‘forced to
reorganize their shelves due to a
Pennsylvania law recently estab-
lished to crack down on thefts of
milk crates. 4

.’’I use them [milk crates] for

books, towels, sweaters, basical-

ly for anything,” said Sherri Bran-
dis, a Pitt sophomore. ”They
.stacl< nicely on top of one another

«and are really convenient.”

The new law involves fines of
$300 or 90 days in jail for any-
one possessing store-owned or
dairy-owned milk crates.‘ The
deadline to return stolen milk

.grates'without penalty is Dec. 9..

Carl Herbein, executive direc- .

tor of the Dairy Industry Associa-

_tion of Western Pennsylvania,

said that stolen milk crates force

' stores to increase milk prices.

”We lose a few, said Frank
Sagoski, manager of the Giant Ea-
gle supermarket, located on
Forbes Avenue. ”I recently
caught two girls taking them.
They are not to be removed, it
says it on the crate. People [steal-

, ing milk crates] should be fined.

lt’s stealing in essence.” A
Sagoski said that Giant Eagle

returns all milkcrates to its milk

distibutors and is charged for any

. crates stolen from its possession.

. According to "Herbein, a mil-
lion dollars worth of ‘milk. crates

has been stolen each‘ year in

Western Pennsylvania. _
Brandis said she obtained her

crates through a friend who stole

them.

. ”They should give us more

time [to return the crates]/’ she _

said, ”at least until the end of the
school year.”

”Who is going to catch you if
they are in your room,” said one
Pitt student who wished to be
anonymous. ”-When I started
stealing them, which was ages

ago, it wasn't a big thing. I can ’

.see maybe now where it's getting

Reagan nominee Ginsburg under firealready

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, November 3, I987

 

WASHINGTON — Supreme

‘Court nominee Douglas H. Gins-

burg’s wife performed two abor-
tions and assisted in a third while
still a medical resident, but later
she ”made a personal decision
not to perform these kind of oper-
ations,” White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said Monday.

A justice department spokes-
man confirmed this past weekend
that Dr. Hallee Perkins Morgan,
wife of the Supreme Court
nominee, performed abortions
during medical training at Beth Is-
rael Hospital in Boston.

Terry Eastland, the spokesman,
said she performed the proce-
dures during her first year of
residency in 1979-80 and agreed

‘ during the next year of training to

assist on particularly difficult

abortions. She has performed

none since then, he said. ‘
Ginsburg was nominated last

Thursday by President Reagan, an

outspoken opponent of abortion.
Ginsburg also faces Senate
questions about his role in an ad-

‘ministration effort that helped

win First Amendment protection
for cable television operators at

a time Ginsburg had almost
$140,000 invested in a cable
company. But President Reagan
indicated Monday he was not

concerned about the situation.

Reagan, questioned by report-
ers, said he had thoroughly
reviewed final candidates for the
nomination, and he said, ’’I’m
satisfied with the appointment.”

Asked whether he was con-
cerned about allegations of a pos-
sible conflict of interest, the
president replied, ”No, not at
all.”

Man leaves infant in
street after fighting

PITTSBURGH — A 35-year-old
Pittsburgh man was charged with
reckless endangerment and relat-
ed counts for allegedy setting a
4-month-old baby in the middle
of a street.

The infant's mother, Jewell An-
derson, told police that Delmar

Carmack kicked down the door
of her apartment after she
returned around 1:45 a.m. Sun-
day from a party.

, Carmack allegedly threatened
to kill three teen-agers who had
been baby-sitting. Anderson said
she ran from the apartment, and
Carmack followed her, grabbing
the baby from the-arms of oneof
the sitters.

He put the child inthe street -

and threatened to leave it there
until it died, ‘she said.

The other charges against Car-
mack were terroristic threats, sim-
ple assault, burglary and
endangering the welfare of a

child, authorities said.

High court to rule
on DA fs death plan

PITTSBURGH — Allegheny
County prosecutors- planned to
ask the state Supreme Court to
reconsider last week's decision to
convert a 20-year-old Pittsburgh
man's death sentence to life in
prison.

The court ruled‘Oct. 26' that
prosecutors failed to prove ag-

gravating circumstances needed
to justify a jury's verdict of death
for Christopher Caldwell. The
court said it lacked authority to
send the case back to a jury for
a new hearing on the sentence.

Caldwell confessed and plead-
ed guilty to a January 1985 rob-
bery in which an elderly
Pittsburgh man and hiswife, for
whom Caldwell had done
chores, were tied in chairs facing
each other, had their throats cut
and were stabbed.

Girl who got organs
resting at Children ’s

PITTSBURGH -- A 3-year-old
Kentucky girl rested under seda-
tion Monday following an ex-
perimental five-organ transplant
made possible by the death of a
baby in Virginia.

”Part of her is living,” said Earl
Shirks, 42, of Pennington Gap,
Va., father of organ donor
Heather Orick, two months.

The recipient, Tabatha Foster _of
Madisonville, Ky., remained in
critical condition, which is nor-
mal after transplant surgery, at

Court refuses to give
death to wife killer

WASHINGTON — The Su-
preme Court Monday refused to
reinstate the death sentence of a
Pennsylvania man who strangled
his wife after he hit her with a
hammer and stabbed her
repeatedly.

The court, without comment,
let stand a ruling that the jury im-
posed capital punishment
without being given anadequate
explanation of ”torture.”

John Nelson was convicted of
killing his wife, Sara, on Feb. 14,
1983, in Millcreek Township, Pa.
Mrs. Nelson was struck on the
head with a claw hammer and
was stabbed six times with a
wood chisel. ,

The Pennsylvania Supreme
Court last April ruled that the tri-
al judge who instructed jurors
during -the sentencing phase of

Nelson's trial did not adequately _

explain what torture means.

Dream On

Aerosmith’s rebuilding efforts
are finally complete as they
produce an album rivaling
those of the past

By Jeff Maffe

Staff Writer

It's more like the end of a va-
cation for the band Aerosmith.
With the release of their new al-
bum Permanent Vacation, Aero-
smith is beginning to grab back
some of the fame they once had
as one of the supergroups of the
'70s. I V .

Aerosmith came out of Boston
in the very early '70s and built a
following on the East Coast.
”Dream On” became the band's
anthem and was their‘ first hit.
Later, Aerosmith decided to re-
release it, and the song became

an even bigger hit.

The band's" biggest album to

date is 1975's Toys in the Attic, '

which contained such classics as
”Wa|k This Way” and ”Sweet
Emotion.” It was after this al-
bum’s release that Aerosmith
came into the limelight and be-
came a headline act across the
country.

However, in the late '70s and
early '80s, the band ran into
some problems.,CuitaristJoe Per-
ry left the group to do his own
thing, and bassist Brad Whitford
left to tour with Derek St. Holmes

of Ted Nugent fame, forming the
Whitford—St. Holmes band. Perry
had a hit or two on his own,
although they couldn't compare
to the songs of his former band.

After a five year hiatus, all of
the original members of the band
got back together to tour, and this
eventually led to the recording of
Done With Mirrors, an album
very much below’ par when com-
pared to records past.

Aerosmith played in Pittsburgh
two years ago with Ted Nugent

as the opening act. They put on J

an energetic show, and it was
good to hear Joe Perry's guitar
again. Unfortunately, Nugent, the
opening act, stole the show.

This year, however, things will
be different. The band was
rebuilding the last time, and they
were a bit sloppy. With a new al-
bum high on the charts and a
chance to regroup, Aerosmith’s
act should be more polished.

The opening act this time is
Dokken. They have had some re-
cent success with their album
Under Lock and Key. Guitarist
George Lynch was voted as
Soloist of the Year for his work on
the song ’’In My Dreams.”

cesful because he-has obviously learned

many skills of the trade.

leaders in independent film releases.
Within the last three years, they -have
scored an impressive number of commer-

cial and critical successes including: Kiss _

of the Spider Woman, The Trip to Boun-
tiful, Mona Lisa, She's Gotta Have It and
this year's River's Edge. To that impres-
sive list of credits can be added another
admirable film called Slam Dance.
The picture is directed by a relative
newcomer to Hollywood, Wayne Wang.
Originally from Hong Kong, Wang's only
major film to date has been Dim Sue: A
Little Bit of Heart. Wang had worked in
television prior to directing his talents

He displays much cinematic adroitness ,

in his new film. The camera shoots from

‘a myriad of angles and with a variety of

lenses that add to the stylistically visual
aura of the film. _

There are recurring dream sequences
that work effectively within the context
ofthe story. There is never confusion as
to whether or not a dream sequence is oc-
curing even though there A is no wavy

screen or mist arising from nowhere.

Wang differentiates the dream state
from reality by flooding the former with
bright lights. He also zooms in on the
dreamer’s facejust prior to his reverie.

There are several devices that Wang uti-

lizes throughout the film, the obvious of
which is his use of mirrors. They appear
continually and cast reflections
everywhere. ' A
Wang is clearly influenced by many
directors, but one of the most obvious in-
fluences is that of Ingmar Bergman. There
are a host of close-ups with the fore-
ground figure in perfect focus while the
background figure remains in a blur; ’
Slam Dance is a veritable feast for the
human eye. The film never lags. There is
never a moment.for reflective contempla-
tion. I watched the film with a college au-
dience of 400 students, which is never the
optimal atmosphere for watching a
movie, and there was hardly a sound
emitted in the theaterthroughout the 100
minutes of running time. ’

Slam Dance stars Tom Hulce (an Os-
car nominee for his portrayal of ‘Mozart-
in Amadeus) as C.C. Drood, an under-
ground cartoonist and painter, whois the
prime suspect in a murder case.’

The case is the impetus for a character» , a

study of Drood and his array of friends.
Hulce turns in a magnificent performance
that captivates the viewers and causes
them to sympathize with his plight.
Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, last seen

as Tom.Cruise’s girlfriend in The Color of _

Money, plays Drood’s estranged wife.
She is a stable mother, working at a nurs-

_ ery school, who does not need the aggra-

vation of Drood’s adolescent personality.
She wants someone to depend on instead

of someone who depends upon .her.,

The Alarm and U2: do they

have something in common?

The Alarm
‘Eye Of The Hurricane
|.R.S.

The Alarm has always been
unfairly compared with U2.
There was something about
the raw, from—the-gut anthems
their first two records yielded
that was purely The Alarm.

Then the richness and diver-
sity of ”Strength,” the power-
ful ”Father To Son” and the
moving ballad ”Wa|k Forever
By my Side” showed the band

to "have complexities that
_.. might allow them to fi rmly es-'

 

tablish their own musical
niche. _

Thus, the new LP Eye ‘Of
The Hurricane is amajor dis-
appointment. A song like
”Newtown Jericho” shows the
band shamelessly following
formulas. Mike Peters breathi-
ly sings lyrics loaded with Bib-
lical imagery, while a piercing,
high-pitched * guitar jangles
over a moody synthesiser part.
”Newtown Jericho” is not un-
like half of U2’s ”The Joshua
Tree,” and in being such an
obvious reference, falls apart.

' - ;jT_he,produtctiongthroughout‘

   

Eye Of The Hurricane (done
jointly by the group and John:

Porter) points up most of the ”

album's failings. Keyboards‘

and electronic drums annoy- _i 
ingly gloss and thicken the ar--f .1 
rangeme/nts; few songs reach  .
any kind of dynamic peak, and .. _ c A

a slick sterility drowns most

«everything. This album ' is _ _.
ldefinitely listenable and easy 
to digest, but it fails to distin- : T V
guish itself from numerous_*
other well.-made but ultimate-T -

ly unexcziting records.-

When tuning in a Pittsburgh
college radio station,.the listener
is bound to hear local groups
whose names have never been
heard in other parts of the
country.

The Affordable Floors and Hec-
tor in Paris have managed to

garner Pittsburgh audiences and

can be heard on college stations
including WPTS-FM from the
University of Pittsburgh and
WRCT-FM of Carnegie Mellon
University. »

But in New York and Ohio,
their music has never been heard
and may have never gone be-
yond the campus audience.

Brad Freeman, station manager
of WPTS, wants to change that
with his new College Radio

Network.
”The basic, big thing,” Free-

g man said, ”is just to get the sta-

tions communicating, to
exchange local bands.”

’’If a band is really good,” Free-
man said, ”the other college sta-
tions are going to notice it.”

He plans to have WPTS act as
a central base for the network —
having that station and its
manager in charge of producing
a bi-monthly newsletter for each
college station to see what groups
are popular in specific regions.

But Freeman said he not only

I chose stations whose location

and dial setting would be easy for
the listeners to tune in but also
those playing music similar to the
progressive programming of
WPTS.

”What we'll ask for,” Freeman
said, ”is for the stations to send

THE PITT NEWS,‘ Tuesday,‘ November 3, I987

in a tape of their local bands, and
we'll also have them fill out a
form that tells us about their sta-
tion to make sure they can han-
dle the network.”

Freeman said that without
CRN, stations have only been
able to communicate and trade
ideas while visiting each other or
at collegiate broadcasting con-
ventions. With CRN, the stations

will be given the chance to. re-

main in continual contact.

Although WBNY of Buffalo,
New York, has expressed interest’
in CRN, Freeman admits it may
be difficult to have more than ten
stations on the East Coast.

”The problem is that college
stations like to operate indepen-
dently,” Freeman said. ”They’re
notorious for wanting to be in-
dependent non-entities.”

 

>CoIlege Radio Network links universities across U.S.

But he said CRN will not try to
vulgarize that independence by
bringing in commercialization,
saying he wants to see college
stations and not the record com-
panies determine what the au-
dience will hear.

Freeman also said the network
will not discriminate against mu-
sical tastes, provided network sta-
tions have an outlet for such
programming as country or reg-
gae songs.

CRN is something Freeman
had been planning to do since his
freshman year at Slippery Rock.
But now that he has arrived at Pitt
and has become WPTS—FM’s sta-
tion manager, CRN has taken its
first breath of life.

”OK, I have a million things to
do,” Freeman admits, ”now I
have a million and one.”

can't hide the shimmering pop
beauty of ”Presence Of Love."
And guitarist Dave Sharp's

compelling.

Unfortunately, there aren't

fore, lives in a world in which she
talks but cannot listen.

The characters are what make
the movie so enjoyable. They are
vibrantly real, almost exclusive-
ly due to Wang's direction,
though all actors were commend-
able in their portrayls. Wang's
camera prowls intensely close to
the character's faces revealing all
their dreams and hidden fears.

The narrative structure is so
convoluted that it is impossible to
decipher what exactly is occur-
ring in the film. Drood dated a
girl who was later murdered. The
girl‘(Virginia Madsen) was in-

7 . 

volved in politics somehow, but
it is never quite clear how.

V .

Drood is forced to do his own ' 

investigative work to uncover the it

real murderer, but the path he fol-
lows is laced with suspense and
danger. Clearly the story of the

murder is secondary in impor- ‘ 
tance to the character studiesjn '

the film.

Slam Dance is a unique and’ ' 
enthralling independent produc- .

tion. There is a diverse visual ar-
ray of images that work quite
effectively. It is a film with little
story but more than enough styl
to compensate. .
