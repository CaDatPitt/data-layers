Med Students Show
StagePotentialities

By DIURRAY CHASS

__._ ' V So you’re wondering how to get into Pitt Medical School,
eh?.Don’t think that your grades or list of activities or money

connections will do it for you.

That stuff is all passe. Now-

adayslthe one biggest qualiﬁcation that will assure admission
is:'be an actor, comedian or impersonator.
How do we know this? It’s easy. We went to see a play

After the play, which was per-
formed for three nights by the
senior medical students, it was
clear to us that the well-known
Pitt M edical
School is pro-
ducing not only
doctors but also
actors, comedi-
ans and imper- _

‘Although the
show was gear-
ed primarily to

 

Deitrick

ed~with themedical school, the
ordinary “laymen” were able to

along with the
medical audience.

Among the attractions that de-
- served the hearty laughter and
prolonged applause. of the full
house at Stephen Foster Me-
morial were‘ Dick Deitrick, a
number -of his talented class-
mates, some really witty scenes
and nine tunes that came-across
as smoothly ‘as any songs per-
formed by a professional troupe.
Deitrick opened the show and
appeared at various times through-
out as the Shakespearean Bard,
the man, who tipped the audience
off as to what would happen next.
It’ is unfortunate that many Pitt
sports fans could not have wit-
nessed Dick in this role. ~
‘ .Sisson Directs ’ »
For the Shakespearean Bard
was "unlike anything »Dick did
while in his undergraduate days
here. The last time Dr. Deitrick,
appeared before the University
public was .a football, basketball
and baseball star from 1951
through 1954.

Although all the students in
the play carried out their parts
in a surprisingly polished man-
ner, several stood out. Among
these were Harvey Klein, Otto
Kessler, Jack Greenberg, John
Perri, Robert Wilkins and Rich-

predominantly

ard Sissoii. The latter two doc-
tors also had a large. part in
writing the show. Sisson was
the producer-director.

Perhaps the outstanding scene
was the one before the ﬁnale. In
a take off on Tennessee Williams’
“Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,” Big
Daddy Litchﬁeld, played by Jack
Greenberg, had all the family as-
sembled trying to select a new
dean of the medical school.

‘Save Our Land’

All of a sudden Cornpone Tay-
lo_r (Bob Wilkins) rushes in with
his confederate army and a couple
of’ local characters, Whitey’ the
White Tower Boy (Marvin Lewis)
and Frankie Gustine (James Rhy-
mer). Asked what they were do-
ing there, Cornpone replied, “They
(Whited and Frankie) asked us to
save their land for them.”

Another of the 26 scenes took
place in an Endocrinology Clinic

(we had to look it up so you can

too) in which was seated at six-
armed man. A doctor entered

’ the room and upon seeing the

man asked, “What seems to be
the problem?” .

In order to get the most enjoy-
ment out of many of the lines, it
was necessary for the viewer to
know the medical dictionary thor-_
oughly and know the doctors of
the faculty at the school. But
there ‘were -enough other lines to
keep the “unsophisticated” seg-
ment of the audience pleased.

Song Lyrics Original '

"All nine songs had original
lyrics although the melo_dies have
been heard before. As‘ an exam-=>

.ple_of the ‘music, there was “Sex

Is Not- a Simple Thing,” per-
formed in Act 1, Scene eight. Here
are a couple of lines from that
riotous number:
To laymen sex is just a trick,
simply a matter of good tech-
’nique‘. But give to us a Madame‘
Bovary. We don’t care if she’s
got ovaries . . . Just so she
knows‘ what‘ to do, in a group
of two. ‘ —
_By the end of the performance,

W. Brown ‘
To Receive

Dent Award  

By En ZINMAN
One of the longest employ-
ed of the University person-
nel was honored recently by

‘members of his profession.

Mr. William L. Brown, clerk
of the ‘Upper Dental School,

sylvania Dental Association, as
first recipient of a yearly award
presented at their annual dinner
meeting.

Criterion for the honor is “This
person must be one who has made
himself known through some out-

profession.”

F e w practicing Pitt Dental
School graduates would not know
Mr. Brown since he first began his
work art the Dental School in 1914.
After three years as custodian he
attained his present position.

' Mr. Brown remembers: “It

was a lot different in those days.

~ There were as many as 456 stu-
dents in the Freshman class
compared to today’s 96). If you
didn’t make -good they’d take
‘you out and then it would be a
different type of drilling’ since
it was World War I.”

“Then, too, the students had to
carry their own foot engines with
them to the infirmary. ' There’s
been a lot of wonderful changes,”
he added.

Dentistry was then a three,
rather than the present four year_
course and Dr. H. E. Friesell was
dean. , _

The Dental "School has under-
gone many changes since. Orig-
inally the Upper Dental School
was located where _the present
Mineral Industries Building lies.

there wasn’t anyone in the.audi..—
ence who wasn’t wondering how
the med students had found time
to prepare such an outstanding
show. . p ’

And there surely was a great
number of people who were not
certain whether those fellows (and
two girls) on stage had gone for
four years to Pitt Medical School
or New .York’s Actors’ Studio.

standing contribution to the dental .

WILLIAM L. BROWN," clerk of the Upper Dental School, was
named by the Western Pennsylvania Dental Association as the first
recipient of a yearly award. Brown has been a Pitt employee for

the past 45 years. - -

constituting the Upper Dental

School" are located in the new

Schools of the Health Profes-

sions building.

The last two years are to a
large extent undertaken at the
dental clinic -at O’Hara_ and
Thackeray Streets. -

Mr. Brown has been at Pitt for
45 years, and has been married
for 57 years. His favorite hobby
is ﬁshing for the “big bass” at
Pymatuning Lake.

When asked if he would keep
on working at the Dental School
as long as he is able; Mr. Brown
replied with -his well known
phrase, “That‘s right!”

SELF-DISCIPLINE

vThe fellow who shows great
courage in the face of adversity is
not without fear—-he shows his
mastery of it.

Annual Lecture Series

’ I The Oﬁice of Cultural and Educational Exchange an-
nounces the establishment.of' an annual lectureship dealing
with the subject of cultural exchange. _ ,
Each annual series will deal with one particular ‘subject

in the-realm of cultural and educational exchange, approach-
ing the field from the standpointsof the various ’academic

disciplines. Each will feature an
outstanding foreign scholar and
will make_a signiﬁcant contribu-

‘tion to scholarship and to the un-

. ‘derstanding of cultural exchange

from the particular disciplinary

. viewpoint. '

The underlying assumption of
thisprojected series is that schol-
arship has an important contribu-
tion to make to the ﬁeld of cul-

.tural and educational exchange.

A further assumption of the
series is that the ﬁeld of cultur-
al and educational exchange is
important to_ many related aca-
demic disciplines and is worthy
of the attention of scholars in
those disciplines. -

The, ﬁrst event in this annual
series is planned for April 23 and
24, 1959, on which days Professor
Werner Philipp of the Free Uni-
versity of Berlin, currently pro-
fessor at the University of Wis-
consin in the ﬁeld of Russian. his-

_tory, will present three lectures
‘ on the general subject, _“Cultural
‘Relations Between Russia and the _

West.”

The first lecture will deal with
“The Reciprocal Effects of the In-

' troduction of Christianity into An-,

cient Russia?’; the second with
“Russia -Between Tradition ‘and
Westernization”; the third with
“The Impact of Western Thought
on Revolutionary Russia.” I
Professor Philipp is one of
Europe’s outstanding specialists
in the ﬁeld of Russian church
and intellectual history. He is
director of the Historical Divi-
sion of the East Europe Insti-
tute at the Free University of
Berlin. In this country he has
lectured previously at Columbia
and Stanford. .

The lectures will be held in the

auditorium of Clapp Hall at 4 and

Dr. Donald Stone‘

8 p.m., Thursday,'April 23 and at
8 p.m. on Friday, April 24. .

The public is invited to join
with the university community in
hearingythis ﬁrst series in the cul-
tural and educational exchange
lectureship. Those desiring further
information are invited to contact
Dr. L. H. Legters at the Ofﬁce of

9. The University’s second annual Honors Convocation,
held last Wednesday, was, unfortunately,_not as successful
as the ﬁrst pne, held in 1958. The immediate sign that one
, could look, for-in determining the success or failure of this
' year’s Convocation, as opposed to last year’s or even taken
by itself, is the attendance at Syria Mosque last Wednesday

By Joseph Ungar
Inﬂuenced by today’s uncohtrollable trend to-
ward progress, a number of individuals out in

' California have recently come up with some re-

markable ideas. In fact, they ‘are ‘almost as re-
markable_ as they are amusing. '

Take the idea of Elizabeth Taylor. In response
to deep inner stirrings, a spirit-
ual hunger, and —a lot of bad
publicity, she has decided to .fol-
low the pattern set by Marilyn
Monroe_ and» has converted to
Judaism. Thisis probably a ﬁne
thing. But, of course, it could
lead to future difﬁculties.

Suppose, for example, the
newly discovered religious angle
takes hold." And suppose that
Hollywood, by’ chance, becomes morally corrupt

 

and goes the way of Sodom and Gemorrah.

In such a case, both of these ﬁne ladies, who
are notably pure in body andsoul but who have‘,
it is said, a slight tendency to disobey orders, could
very‘well end up as pillars of salt.’ Andwho wants
to‘be a pillar of salt?

More HRs‘. More Money

Then there is Walter O’Malley. Everyone knows

him~as a nice, jovial, light-hearted gentlemaniwho

likes to make money. Lastyear he fathered the _

idea that more people in baseball parks mean more
money, and that more home runs mean more
people in baseball parks.

So he transplanted the Brooklyn Dodgers from
Ebbetts Field to the gigantic Los Angeles Coli-
seum. Then he built a left ﬁeld screen close be-
hind third base and satiback. , 0

Fans poured into the stadium. Those sitting
near the rim had a hard time seeing the players
and sometimes saw the ‘ball. On hot days they
found themselves unsheltered in the blazing sun

. this coordination.

cause a great many balls hit or sailed over the-

left ﬁeld screen. ,

"Unfortunately, however, the excitement was
dampened somewhat by a distant right ﬁeld screen
which cut the potential fun in half. This year Mr.
O’Malley cleverly remedied the situation by also
drawing in that screen. Rumor has it that if this
plan doesn’t work, he will next year shift home
plate to the outfield."
A. Progressive Educator

Another man with a progressive idea is Dr.
Leslie N. Nason. Dr. Nason does not concern him-
self with religion or baseball. He is a professor of
education at the University of Southern California,
and he makes surveys. .

Late last year, he surveyed a number of gifted
students in a Long Beach high school. His studies
led to the following conclusion, a conclusion which
should thrill all high school football coaches. Dr.
Nason foundlthat it is not very good for students
to be. smart. "In his own words, it goes like this:

“The gifted child generally‘ prefers associating
with the teacher rather than playing with class-
mates on the playground. His muscular control
never develops properly and as a consequence
neither does his penmanship, which depends on

“Thus, there develops a block between his
thinking process and what he is able to communi-
cate intelligibly in writing. He never develops or-
ganizational skills. A ceiling is placed on his future
attainments. i

“The time comes,” he goes on “when the ‘prob-
lems are too complex for -fnental computation.
Then Then the student’s ineptitude with pencil
and paper will place another ceiling on his de-
velopment.” _

Evidently, Nason feels that students have ceil-
ings. Nevertheless, his observation says a mouthful.
Little canbe added. Rumor hasiit that Dr. Nason
spends hot afternoons in the blazing sun at the Los

The Mosque, which seats approximately 3500 people,
surprisingly was .much too empty.lThe entire ﬁrst ﬂoor and
balcony were ﬁlled, but there was only a scattering of peo-
.ple_ inthe second balcony. How many of these spectators
were University students? All those on'the ﬁrst ﬂoorwere
students who were being honored. There were 762 of them.‘

But the seats in the ﬁrst ‘balcony were taken up almost

Music Lends Perfection
The play, performed very ably

by the Arden Camphire com-

, pany, was accompanied by ori-

ginal music for' flute and piano
composed by Llyod Kropp, a

its setting is
h e r e —— above
the Golden Tri-
angle, and now A

style of the Greek dramas, com-

" plete with a chorus of news-
papermen which adds a humor-
ous, if biting tone. (These men
of course represent those. who
carelessly ride roughshod ' over
.the gentleness of life.)

Style First Awkward
This style at ﬁrst seems awk-
ward, both to the audience and
to the actors. We are unaccus-
tomed to having a poem with» all
its depth of meaning spoken to

graduate student in humanities
at the University. The music
lends a touch of perfection to an
already intensely moving pro-
duction; the fluteseems a par-
ticularly appropriate instrument
for expressing mood.

Another particularly apt touch
was-added by a painting done
by Mrs. Lee intended to repre-
sent the “heroine” of the poem.
The serenity of this 0 painting
added immeasurably to Naomi

_, This total is appalling. Out of a student body of 7000
_'only 15 per cent were stimulated enough to attend the "pro-
. ceedings. Nothing could speak more poorly for a'University
than something such as this. Where were the students? As
 one undergraduate put it, “I never heard at 9 a.m. so many
‘people making plans to go downtown.”

One possible reason why the Convocation was so poorly
‘attended-was the lack of publicity. Very few people were
aware before last Monday that Archibald MacLeish' was

 

speaking here. One might think that the administration was
trying to keep that fact a secret in that the news was re-
_leased so late. -

Perhaps the reason lies in the relative drawing power
of last year’s speaker, Robert »Frost,'and MacLeish. Frost’s ~
appearancecalled for SRO’signs at the ﬁrst Convocation.
But it seems unlikely that such a gap exists between the
- two literary greats in manystudents’ minds that this would
have caused thegreat decrease in‘ attendance.

Itmay be to commit treason to‘say that Pitt students '
V are as- yet not ready for men of MacLeish’s stature to at-
tempt to appear here, but this maybe the only conclusion.

v ‘Besides the small size of the audience, there is still
another part of the Convocation which was ‘a failure. That

terial possessions, only to realize,
in ' anguish, their emptiness. In

Mr. Lee’s poem-play, however, "

Faust is not thecentral charac-
ter; he is merely one. of three
who have failed in some meas-
ure to understand what living is.

Each is rejected by a woman,
who symbolizes life; the artist is
too dedicated, there -is “too much
of heaven in his love”; the hus-
band desires her only for an
ornament, and Faust would give
too little in return for the tre-
mendous gift she gives. The hus-
band and Faust typify a ,partic'-
ularly American kind of failure.

Afraid to Love

The one supresses his need for

us. Weaare embarrassed at hav-
ing the kernal of life’s truth pre-
sented to us divested‘ of all the
'part.iculars and amenities of day
to day existence. ‘
Perhaps, too, our ﬁrst inclina-
tion is to reject it as “artiﬁcial”
or “ridiculous and stilted” be-
cause if we were toadinit that
this is truth we, as Faust, would
then have to admit our failures.
As‘ the poem-play progresses,
however, the outer shell of our
-materialism is broken down, and
we begin to realize that here __be—
fore us are the simple, obvious
truths of life that we so often
ignore. We, no less than the
Greeks, can be tragic figures; we,

Radkoff’s stirring portrayal.

Mr. Lee’s presentation is, in-
deed a dramatic poem; it is not
the ordinary -entertainment we
are presented with as day to day
fare on Broadway and else-
where. Indeed, it is not really
entertainment at all; one is too
deeply affected by the play to

call it by ‘so common a term.

This play is certainly not com-
mercial theater; it is something
more than that. It does not pos-
sess a story which can be satis-
fying to those who are not mov-
ed by ‘the message it reveals.
Mr. Lee’s poem cannot appeal to
any who have not the courage to
admit that this is life.

  n,i..g Instruction Program lanned

 

., Cadets Participate‘

In Flight Training
With Piper Cubs

By MERL BALDWIN
“Get thatnose down! Keep

"er straight! That’s it. Now,

see, she ﬂies herself once you
give her a chance.” Words to
this effect are rapidly becom-
ing familiar to the 13 Air

Force and six Army cadets par- 

ticipating in the Flying Instruc-
tion Program started here at the
University this year.

Planned t6 save the Air Force
and Army time and money in
basic ﬂight schools, the FIP has
been more than a year comingto
Pitt. The cadets are learning to
ﬂy at the Butler-Graham Airport
located about eight miles‘ south of
Butler, Pa. . _

, Scholter Aviation Company has

been contracted to teach the

cadets their basic theory of ﬂight.
Fly in J—3 Piper Cubs

The cadets are learning to ﬂy
in time-provén J—3 Piper Cubs,
the airplane that enjoys the rec-
ord, of being the airplane in which
more people have received their
primary ﬂight training/than in
any -other yet manufactured.

-Slcholter Aviation’s two in-

structors, Mr. Donald Link and
Mr. Dale Kottraba,‘both of But-
ler ‘County, are qualified_ in-
structor pilots with long ‘records
of ﬂying behind‘ them.

‘Link has logged‘ 25,000 hours of
instructor time alone. Kottraba,

‘more of a newcomer to the avia-

tion business than Link, is a com-
mercial pilot and an instructor
with a full instrument rating at
24 years of age.

Travel Expenses Paid

Flying instruction at Scholter
Aviation normally. costs $13 per
hour. Through the FIP, however,
cadets pay nothing but their time
and interest. ROTC foots the bill.
In fact, the cadets are paid $2.50
each time they .drive to Butler-
Graham to cover their travel ex-
penses.

“It’s a wonderful opportunity
for anyone planning a ﬂying

career,” said ‘Mr. Link. “You
boys want to get all you can
from it.” .

In addition to the 36 hours! of
dual and solo ﬂight instruction
the cadets receive in the “Cub,”
upon completion of the course,

(when he is able to qualify for

his Civil Air Patrol pilot’s license)

3 Days Flying Weather

So far-, everyone is doing well
in his ﬂying. The Piper Cub is
famous for being a “forgiving
little bird. The biggest trouble
that the cadets have run into so
far is the weather.

“We’ve averaged only three
days a week that we can use
for teaching beginning pilots,”
Mr. Kottraba c o m m e n t e (1.
‘‘There’s ﬂying ‘weather here on
an average of five or six days a
week but most of them just
aren’t for students.” .

The Cubs cruise at about 65
mph, but there have been days of

60 mph gusts of wind when Mr.

Link has throttled the engine
down and ﬂown backwards. “The
kids-might as well be ﬂying kites
on days like, that,” he‘ said.

The cadets themselves are en-
thusiastic about the FIP to the
degree that they talk about
little else in their spare time.
“You’ve got to move everything
when you’re up there,” said Jim
Wempa, one of the Air Force
students. “One hand on the
stick, the other on the throttle,
and both feet busy with the
rudder pedals — talk about one
armed paperhangers!”

All the cadets, seem to share the

opinion one expressed as he burst
into the ready room. ,“As far as
I’m-concerned,” he said, “it’s the
greatest thing they’ve gotten’ in
the University .since they intro-
duced the Coed!”

THE CARE AND FEEDING OF ROOM-MATES

Room-mates are not only heaps of fun, but they are also very
educ:Lt~ional, for the proper study of mankind is man, and there
is no better way to learn the dreams and drives of another man
than to share a room with him. *

This being the case, it is wise not to keep the same room-
mate too long, because the more room-mates you have, the
more you will know about the dreams and drives of your
fellow man. So try to change room—m:ites as often as you can.
,A 1'ecent,study made by Sigafoos of Princeton shows that the
best interval for changing room—matcs is every four hours.

How do you choose a room-mate? Most counselors agree
that the most important thing to look for in r0om—mates is that
they be people of regular habits. This, I say, is arrant nonsense.
Wllat if one of their .regular habits happens to be beating a
Chinese gong from.midnightto dawn? Orgrowing cultures in
your tooth glass? Or reciting the Articles of War?

Regular habits, my foot!_TheA most important quality in la
room-mate is that he should be exactly your size. Otherwise
you will have to have his clothes altered to ﬁt you, which can
be a considerable nuisance. In fact, it is sometimes ﬂatly im—‘
p()ssible. I recollect one time I roomed with a man named
Osage Tremblatt who was just under seven feet tall and weighed

_ nearly four hundred pounds. There wasn’t a blessed thing I
. could use in his entire wa.rdrobe———until one night when I was
invited to a masquerade party. I cut one leg off a pair of Trem-
bIatt’s trousers, jumped into it, sewed up both ends, and went
to the party a.s a bolster.‘ I took second prize. First prize went

her head and went as a candied apple.

But I digress. Let us turn back to the qual_il:ies that make
desirable room-mates. Not the least of these is the cigarettes
they smoke. When we bum cigarettes, do we want them to be
shoddy and nondescript? Certainly not! We want them to be
distinguished, gently reared, zestful and zingy. And what ciga-
rette is distinguished, gently reared, zestful and zingy? Why,

To go on. In selecting a. room—ma.te, find someone who will
wear well, whom you’d like to keep as 9. permanent friend.
Many of history’s great friendships first started in college. Are‘
you aware, for example, of the‘remarka.l)le fact that Johnson
and Boswell were room-mates at Oxford in 1712'? What makes
this fact so remarkable is that in 1212 Johnson was only three
years old and Boswell had not yet been born. But, of course,
children matured eu.rlier- in those days. Take Mozart, who
wrote hisﬁrst symphony at four. Or Titian, who painted his
first masterpiece at ﬁve. Or Hanso Felbgung, who was in many
ways the most remarkable of all; he was appointed chief of the
Copenhagen police department at the age of six!

It must be admitted, however, that he did badly. Criminals
roamed the city, robbing and looting at will. They knew little
Hanso would never pursue them——he was not allbwed to cross

_ Today’s game would have-been
something of a homecoming for’
Pitt alumnus Canterna. Dodo

v Maser Bright Spot

One of the bright spots in the
Panther lineup, if and when it is
given a chance to perform, could
very well be First Baseman Ron
Maser.

Sophomore Maser, who is call-
ed “Lefty” by his friends, is the
same lad who pitched ﬁve straight
shutouts to lead McKeesport High

ball title.

During the championship
game Maser hurt his knee, -and
afterwards had to alter his
pitching style due to the injury.
This eventually led to a sore
arm. After graduating from Mc-
Keesport in 1956, he received an
$8000 scholarship to Arizona
University.

Maser left Arizona after several
months because ‘he believed that
he didn’t deserve the scholarship
since he was unable to pitch.
After a brief stay at ‘Penn State
in early 1957, Maser left and came
to Pitt. He switched positions and
is now- one of the Panthers’ top
hitters. A

Jack Yedlica was the Panthers’

went to third on an error.

Shutterly then drove him in with

Shutterley was in a jam in the

‘At the Pitt Wildwood club Sat-

Mason and Swaney also com-
bined in the first of the doubles
events to come up with another

“Waynesburg should offer more
opposition on their home courts,
but I feel very optimistic about

our chances,” Coach Bill Sum-.

mers reported.

In the netmen’s first meet of the
season last Tuesday with West-

drilling, Coach John Michel-

to round into shape for their
May 2 dress ‘rehearsal at the
Wildwood Club. The Panthers

have been brushing up on their
fundamentals and running
through plays for the‘past two
weeks.

Michelosen has been holding
light scrimmages throughout the
past week whilestaging a major
scrimmage on Saturdays.

The usual amount of injuries
have ‘plagued the Panthers in
the spring session. Norton Sea-
man, first -unit guard and star
placekicker, has been sidelined
because of a leg injury.

Last season Seaman was also
hampered by leg injuries. Others
receiving injuries have been Half-
back Curt Plowman and Fullback
Fred‘ Riddle. Both boys suﬁered
ankle injuries but are not ex-
pected to be out of action long.

Two quarterbacks are battling
for the number two quarterback
position behind Ivan Toncic.
They are junior Pete Prince and
‘sophomore Dave Kraus. '

Kraus looked very good in the

’ ﬁrst scrimmage and is expected to

help ﬁll the shoes of Ed Sharock-
man who* has departed from
school.
