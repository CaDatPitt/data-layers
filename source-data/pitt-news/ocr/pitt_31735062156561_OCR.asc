974 Freshmen on Campus
Get Activities Rush

Fall registration at Pitt has shown a slight decrease but the
decrease is apparently in the upperclass sections and not in the
freshmen class, according to E._]. .\lCIr1t0Sl1, assistant to the

dean of men.

Figures, although incomplete, show that 974 freshmen were

admitted at the end of the Sept. 9
registration.

Pitt freshmen this fall are being
provided with a score of activities.
Two of these, the freshmen smoker,
last Wednesday in FosterMemorial,
and the first of eight Mixer Dances,
which was held Thursday, have
already inagurated the first week
of school.

Frosh orientation classes and

Dean’s Groups are scheduled to
meet once a week for six weeks.

At the end of that time all new
freshmen will be required to take an
Qrientation exam.

During the six week span all
freshmen must abide by the rules
set down by ‘.1en’s Council and
WSGA.

University
Averts AFL
Strike

A threatened strike of union
painters was averted Tuesday
when the athletic department
agreed to cease painting opera-
tions on which non-union men

were being employed.

The agreement was reached be-
tween a top University official and
William Lobaugh, foreman of the
union painters.

The union protest and walk-out
threat focused upon the athletic
departments’ use last week of non-
union labor for the painting of Trees
Gymnasium.

Immediately upon receipt of the
union protest, Raymond L. Coss,

superintendent of buildings and
grounds, requested Frank Carver,
graduate manager of athletics, to
suspend the work being carried on
in Trees Gym.
Painting Stopped

(Tarver, acting in the absence of.
Capt. Tom llamilton, director of
athletics, ordered all painting
stopped pending Capt. Hamilton’s
return last Saturday. Further action
by the union was also postponed
until the (Iaptain’s position could
be explained.

The athletic department, ac-
cording to Frank Carver, was act-
ing on the theory that its own men
could be utilized for odd jobs of
painting. Working on a close bud-
get, the department planned an in-
expensive painting job on the ‘gym,
scheduled for demolition within
two years.

This position was explained to
the union at Tuesday's conference.

None But Union

The conference ended in an
understanding that hereafter the
athletic department would hire none
but union painters.

Recently, according to Frank
Carver, the department used union
labor for the major job of painting
exposed steel in Pitt Stadium.

During Capt. Hamilton’s absence,
the halt of athletic department
painting extended even to post-
poning the stencilling of seat num-
bers in the Pitt Stadium demonstra-
tion block.

Senior Opens Criisade

On Grid Pools,Numbers

A Pitt student has opened a one man crusade to clean up

gambling on the campus.

Emil Mrkonic

a pre-law senior, says he will "eliminate”

football pools, numbers writing and other types of gambling from

the campus.

Mrkonic will use his police power as a constable in the tenth
ward of MCKeesport to carry-out his attack on local gambling in-
terests. The 23 year-old senior was elected to the post last year.

Estimates made today of the number of students who have

dropped out of the University to
that Pitt has escaped the fate

of several schools across the

country and suffered almost no drop in enrollment from thatcause.

While UCLA lost l,l00 primarily
through the draft and military call-
ups, and other schools admit that
they are “worried about the out-

look,” tentative estimates made
by William F. Saalbach, assistant
to the dean of men, and Mary V.
Stevenson, secretary to the dean of
men, totalled less than 35 students
who have dropped out to enter the
services.

last summer, about 25 veteran re-
servists have been called to active
duty, and since the start of the
present semester the rate of with-
drawals has been about 3 a day.
So far, there have been no volun-

tary enlistments by vets.

Among the non-veterans, Miss
Stevenson said that to the best of
her knowledge less than ten had
left for the services, and of these,
only one had enlisted.

Effects Later

The situation is expected to last
only until the end of the present
semester, however. In a recent news
release, john Newton Baker, public
relations director at Florida State
University, predicted that at that
time every school in the country
will suffer a sharp drop in enroll-
ment.

It is then that students who have
been deferred in order to complete
the current school term will be
called up.

His police power extends through-
out Allegheny County.

Charging that the gambling situa-
tion on the campus is "degrading,"
he plans to enlist the aid of city
police to help eradicate it. Foot-
ball pools and numbers writing are
automatically subject to prosecu-
tion.

Football pools and numbers writ-
ing on the campuses of Pitt and
other Pittsburgh colleges were
first brought to light in the Pitts-
burgh newspapers last year,Mrkonic
revealed. They were mentioned in
connection with a recent grand
jury investigation, he added.

Blames Schools

Mrkonic stated that Pittsburgh
colleges "foster and promote foot-
ball pools and the like."

He says that students who take
such courses as economics try to

use the knowledge they gain in
classrooms to beat the football
pools.

GI’s and ROTC men, he pointed
out, often used the money they re-
ceive from the government to play
numbers or try to beat the foot-
ball pools.

Charges Denied

University officials, when in-
formed ofMrkonic’scharges,denied
that the University condones such
gambling devices.

"I know of no pools in operation
at the University of Pittsburgh.
Certainly they are not condoned by
the University in any respect. I
have noevidence of any suchgambl-
ing in operation at the present time.
If I had such evidence the Univer-
sity would have taken action to pre-
vent it," stated T.W. Biddle, dean
of men.

Dean Charles B. Nutting of the
law school said, "It is of course
contrary tofact that the University
of Pittsburgh as an institution
fosters and promotes football pools.
It is difficult to gain knowledge in
any field that cannot be misused. I

"I do not think the University
will stop teaching economics simply
because knowledge obtained can be
used to beat the football pools.”

Vet, Legal Rulings Made

Pre-Legal Test *
Ruling Enacted

All pre-legal students will be
required to take the Law School
Admission Test as a partial ful-
fillment of admission requirements
for a number of leading American
law schools.

The test will be administered
by the Educational Testing Ser-
vice at more than 100 centers,
not yet announced throughout the
United States on Nov. 18, 1950 and
on Feb. 24, and Apr. 28, 1951.

Since most schools select their
freshman class in the spring, it is
advisable that the candidates take
the test on Nov. 18, 1950.

Students intending to go to law
school must make separate appli-
cations to each school of his
choice, and inquire whether he has
to take the Law School Admission
Test.

Pitt is one of the many schools
which does require the test for
admission.

Insurance

Sales Good

The Student Hospital and Medi-
cal Care Plan, offering a low-
cost insurance program to all full-
time University students, had re-
ceived II98 paid premiums as of
Sept. 26.

.The returns of the Johnstown
extension, graduate, and pharmacy
schools, not yet received, are ex-
pected to shoot this year’s enroll-
ment well over last year's 1800.

Under the plan the student is
covered 24 hours a day, twelve

.months a year beginning on the

day he enrolls and pays his 3310
premium.

Those who still wish to take ad-
vantage of this offer may enroll at
the Student Desk on the ground
floor. Dean of Men Theodore W.
Biddle, in expressing his opinion
of the plan, said, “It is an excel-
lent project designed for young

_people.”

“Welcome”
Panther Lists

“Welcome Back” says the Pan-
ther magazine staff in the first
edition of the humor magazine, on
sale Oct. 11.

Some of the features to be found
in the first edition are; a section
of pin-up pictures, an analysis of
the new “T” football era here, a
spread on the Pitt band, and a
special section that upperclass-

men are supposed to overlook-it’s'

for freshmen only.
Keystone of Panther policy this

year, according to Editor Don
Horowitz, is to experiment with
new material and test reader

reactioﬂ thereby getting an idea
of what kind of magazine the
students want and will buy.

Campus Interviews on Cigarette Tests

Number l...THE PUFFIN BIRD

  "What’s all the /Luﬂin’ and puﬁin’ about?
I ’ve been a Puyﬁn all my life!”

You may think this “bird” is funny — but he’s no

odder than many of the cigarette tests you’rc asked to make these days.

One puff of this brand — one snifi of that. A quick inhale — a fast exhale-

and you’re supposed to know what cigarette to smoke from then on. The sensible

test doesn’t have to rely on tricks and short cuts. It’s a day-after-
day, pack-after-pack tryout — for 30 days. That’s the
test Camel asks you to make! Smoke Camels regularly for
30 days. Your “T-Zone” (T for Throat, T for Taste)
is the best possible proving ground for any cigarette.
After you’ve made the Camel 30-Day Mildness Test,

we believe you’ll know why . . .

than any other cigarette!

The Captain was asked for a plan, and he presented one. V

itself in a possible war effort.

should carry a lot of weight.

***

Regardless of what we may think of Athletic Director Tom
.Hamilton’s hour-a-day physical education proposal, few would
deny that some such plan should be seriously considered as the
University, with an eye on world conditions, attempts to integrate

Along this line, a recommendation aimed at getting potential
servicemen into top physical condition before their entry into
service seems eminently in order.

Further, a recommendation from a man possessing an ex-
tensive military, as well as physical education, background

So let’s take a look at Capt. Hamilton’s proposal.

***

He suggests scheduling every full-time male student of the
University to a one-hour-per-day session of physical education,
five days a week. His proposal suggests no means by which this

program is to be implemented. He is the first to admit that accept-
ance of-his planwould present “serious difficulties” to the phys
ed staff in the implementation of the program.

I I Capt. Hamilton is acting on the principle of "Tell ’em what
you think is right, and once your program is accepted, work out
the details to fit it.” This,rather than "Consider every detail
and work out the program to fit the details.” ‘ »

And there’s much to support the Captain’s reasoning. If five
hours a week of phys ed is what is needed to get the male popu-
lation of the school into shape, don’t accept less class time,

***

thereby settling for an inadequate program.

=|!**

Nevertheless, a few details should be kept in mind. Assum-
' ing that the Captain’s proposal is accepted and that there are
roughly 8000 full-time men students, no less than 1000 men
would have to be handled each hour of the school day to meet

the conditions of the program. This situation would present, we
feel, something more than "serious difficulties.”

Also, a gym period of one hour results in a subtraction of
two hours from the student’s day, for reasons obvious to the
man who has taken gym at Trees-- time consumed travelling
to and fro, dressing, showering, etc. Thus the program would
result in«a ten-hour chunk beingt aken out of a student’s week.

Nevertheless,

the seriousness and the timeliness of the

suggestion demands its prompt and careful consideration by the
Board. of Deans, to whom it was presented.

riChancellor Applies Ax
To Pitt’s Budget

by Myron Kopelman

 

' , ml‘
"The Economy Year.” That’s what this 1950-51 academic
year is called when faculty members get to hob-nobbing over

. their celery in the Faculty Club. In other words, this is the year

in which Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald got out the ice pick and
stabbed about five more holes into the University’sfinancial belt.
Departmental budgets were slashed right and left. I am not

certain, but in all probability,
piercing shrieks were heard from
behind every pillar and post.

Nobody likes a budget cut. Not
even the fellow doing the cutting.
It is, however, a job that has to
be done.
Strange Timing

Still in all, it seems strange that
an “economy year” should come at
a time when the University is think-
ing of expanding into a wholesale
project of new—buildings.Ordin arily,
you don’t buy yourself a flock of
summer homes when you cannot pay
the mortgage on the old homestead.

Now it is a fact that the funds
that are appropriated or donated for

,, the building program are specifi-

cally directed toward that program
when given, and cannot be invested
in other University use-s. Likewise,
funds given for, say,the Nationality
Rooms cannot be thrown into the
building program.

Whether or not the University
could gather more funds for the
maintenance of possessions al-
ready in existence by forgetting
about the building program, I do
not know. I have only six credits
in economics.

Perfectly clear, however, is the

l Overset
by Bob Thomas

Maybe it’s none of our business
but it appears that the freshman
dink program is slipping again.

Either that or the freshmen are
dropping out of school like the pro-
verbial flies. Sometime Men's Coun-
cil is going to have to come to a
decision to bring an adequate en-
forcem ent system to the P,-itt campus
if it wants its program tolsucceed.

We have in mind the Penn State
system with specific upperclassmen
charged with enforcing freshman
customs. Known as "hat men,”
they are members of governing
bodies and upperclass honorary
organizations. Their identification
is the distinctive hats which they
wear.

It's plain to see that if Men's
Council must have dinks -— and I
believe that the freshmen them-
selves would be the last ones to
object -- it must provide a stronger
method of enforcement than that
provided by a generally lackadaisi-
cal upperclass student body.

Hamilton and Muscles

To leave dinks for the time
being, though", what do you think of
Captain TomHamilton’s proposal of
physical education for everybody? ,
. One thing sure - if it should go
through we're all going to be either
mighty athletic or mighty tired-

You will read on page one of
this issue that the armed services
have barely tapped Pitt's man-
power so far. Assistant Registrar
Endicott A. Batchelder was one of
those tapped - only lightly, how-
ever.

A major in the 459th AAA Arm‘
ored Weapons Division, a reserve
outfit, Mr. Batchelder was alerted

Federal Aid?

Some say that higher education
can be maintained in a fitting style
only by a Congressional bill pro-
zirling for federal aid,to education.
Despite cries that federal aid would
influence teaching matter and
threaten academic freedom, high
officials at Pitt are reported to
favor such legislation.

Yet even if federal aid is the
answer, the unexpected demands
made by the Korean business and
by President Truman’s new mili-
tary preparedness program seem to
have placed aid-to-education out of
thequestion, for the present.

It appears, then, that Chancellor
Fitzgerald will be keeping his ice
pick handy for some time to come.

Dinks! They’re everywhere: on the walks, in the Tuck Shop

squeezed into elevator corners,

and bobbing in and out of the

version of pride.

The fact that faculty and staff

students cars, blue splashed, can
only use general and public areas
has been called undemocratic. Both
students ‘and faculty are dissatis-

Frats Offer

Suggestions

-To Officials

BY BORIS‘ WEINSTEIN

Before the start of the 1930
interfraternity football season, a
dozen undergraduate fraternities

have been contacted in an effort
to get their opinions and sugges-
tions on the officiating of IF foot-
ball games.

The results of this question and
answer session have found the
Greeks not entirely satisfied with

Intramural Director Leo Bemis’
whistle tooters.

The frats were asked these
questions:

l~Do you think the officiating

has been satisfactory?

l

,2

 

 

2-Do you think the officials
have been partial at times?

3-What would you suggest to
improve the officiating?

In answering the first question
most of the fraternities agreed that
the officials handled the games
‘fairly well’. However, they feel a
‘fairly well’ called game is by no
means good officiating.

The PiKA’s, for example, are
convinced that “poor officiating is
caused by incompetent officials”.
They also insist that many offi-
cials are not schooled well enough
in the game to serve as officials.

Pi Lamb, on the other hand, is
satisfied with the officiating, but
asks only for rule clarifications
before each incoming sport.

Half of the fraternities represent-
ed in the poll agreed that games
are judged impartially. The other
half were able to recall instances

Reports from last year’s Orange Bowl game, in which Len Casa-

nova’s Santa Clara team came from behind to upset favored Kentucky,

gave a large share of the credit to

This year’s Panther squad will
follow the same trend, and be one
of the better conditioned teams in
the country.

Proof of this came while watch-
ing the Panthers run through prac-
tice plays, sprinting from 25 to 50
yards for approximately 15 minutes,
without any seemingly undue strain
on their wind.

Team on Tap 
/y Creen Pitt Backs Geared 
  To Stop Cox’s Passes 

By WILL DOERGE

Len Casanova’s Pitt Panthers, all decked out in their new
"T” formation, left this morning for Durham, N.C., to face the
"passingest” team in Duke history tomorrow.

It’s no secret that Duke depends on the pass as its main

‘offensive weapon. They have All-American candidate Billy Cox

to do the throwing, and he's expected to do plenty of that against

the P anthers.

Last week Duke was forced to go through the air to win over
a strong-lined South Carolina eleven. The Blue Devils’ offensive
line seemed too light to open up holes for their runners, so their.
attack along the ground was stalled.

Threw 32 Passes

So Cox, along with Fullback
Jack Mounie, threw a record num-
ber of 32 passes
in whipping the
Gamecocks, 14-0.

The same si-
tuation should
prevail this week.
Pitt has a vete-
ran line that is
expected to re-
pulse the oppo-
sition’s ground
attack. Thus,
Duke figures to
be air-minded
against the Panthers. V

Meanwhile, Casanova and his
assistants, realizing what to ex-
pect, have been concentrating on
setting up a pass —defense this
week. They also realize that they
do not have an experienced defen-
sive back on the team.

Banks on Sichko"

Sichko

“Our defensive backs are very T

green,” wails Jack Roche, back-

field coach. "The only ones with
experience at all are Bill Sichko
and Armand DiFonso.”

Sichko is slated to be the Pan-
ther’s safety man, while DiFonso

 

and Sophomore Bill Reynolds are
the defensive halfbacks. Another

sophomore, Joe Schmidt, is the
fullback and line-bacl<er ; on
defense.

Capp Doubtful

The injured Joe Capp, who may
only see limited service, is being
counted on as a defensive back
this year, in addition to his offen-
sive fullback duties.

Pitt’s offensive backfield for
tomorrow shapes up like this..
Bob Bestwick at quarterback,
Sichko at left half, Jim Campbell
at right half, and John Huzvar, full-
back. Huzvar will play his first,
and last, game for the Panthers be-
fore he leaves for the Marines next '
week.

It’s the backfield that holds the
key to Pitt's success this season,
no doubt about that-both on of-
fense and detfense.

THE PITT NEWS -- Friday, September 29, 1950 -- Page 6

llow the Smart Boys
Called the Turn

From the very start of spring football drills there had been a
lot of blah-blah claiming that Pirt’s line would have to carry its
backfield if the Panthers are to go anywhere this year. Yet the

the hunch here was that the coach-
ing staff, right up until the start of
fall practice, regarded the talk as
just so much gum-beating.

Naturally, the boss men were
not saying so. Let the critics be
pleasantly surprised. If they did
not commit you, why commit your-
self?

So the grandstand and press box
quarterbacks went on tch-tching
and moaning that the all-rookie
backfield would be more suitable
for cheek-pinching than for tack-
ling; and in the meantime, Casa-
nova and his lieutenants went

ahead preparing their little sur-
prise party.

Shrewdness Lacking, Yes

Certainly the coaches were not
kidding themselves about the
defensive weaknesses of a youth-
ful backfield. A good pass defense
can be made up only from a group
of shrewdies who have many a rug-
ged Saturday afternoon behind
them. You don't replace a smart
Cookie like Carl DePasqua by
pulling someone out from under
a freshman dink. I

Yet even with a weak passide-
fense, this young backfield show-
ed signs of being a lot stronger
than most people thought. They
had an offense, a very promising
offense.

Fast? They don’t come much
faster than Paul Chess, Bill
Sichko, Bobby Bestwick, and Jim
Campbell. Deep? Why, there were
guys on the bench named Schmidt,
Capp, Reynolds, Huzvar, and De
Fonso, who possessed either po-
wer, speed, or brains. In some
cases, a combination of those.
qualities was present.

No. In all probability, the
coaches were not losing near as
much sleep over this backfield a
month ago as were the smart

Curtain Time
For Harriers

A minor sport will open Pitt-’s
sports schedule when the Panther
cross country "team hosts West-
‘minster and Geneva at Schenley
Park tomorrow at 11:30 a.m.

With the loss of Captain Jay
Neilson and Ted Zatkovich, Pitt’s
hopes of equaling last year’s
highly successful record of four
wins and one loss are slim, ac-
cording to Coach Carl Olson. Five
veterans, Ed Berman, Ken Mahanna
John McMahon, Jack Weigle, and
Frank Kuzma form the nucleus of
the seven man team.

The 1950 schedule follows:

Sept. 30 - Westminster and Geneva at
Pittsburgh
Oct. 7 - Slippery Rock at Slippery
Roc

boys.

But then what happened?

Fullback Chess, who thought he
had been transferred from the
active to the inactive Marine
Reserves, was called to gervice,
the explanation being that he did
not respond to a letter directing
him to return his equipment to
make the transfer official. Chess
protested that he had received no
such letter. The Marines gave him
the back of their neck.

Chess

An Epidemic »

At the same time, Fullback Mike
Omatick was called into the
Marines. Less than three weeks

later ‘Fullback Joe Capp suffered
a badly sprained ankle which may
yet cause him to watch tomor-
row’s opener from the bench. This
week came the payoff when John
Huzvar was called by the Marines
--the fourth fullback to come down
with a case of unexpected circum-
stances.

Inasmuch as no coach can pro-
duce a bowl contender with three-
quarters of a backfield, you might
say that Casanova’s little surprise
party for the critics probably has
ended before it begun.

And now, what have we left
with us ? A pack of critics who will
be saying all season long, “See.
No backfield. I told you so last
spring.”

was administered.

After voicing their opinions, the
Greeks came up with a few sug-
gestions of their own. They be-
lieve that games will be judged
better if more competent men with
a keener background of the game
are installed,

The majority of the fraternities
would also like to see non-frater-
nity men officiating at fraternity
battles. This, they believe, will

   
   

eliminate a certain amount of
favoritism that is present.
If these suggestions are in-

stalled, the Greeks feel that not
only football officiating will be
improved but also that officials
will have an easier time directing

landscape.
