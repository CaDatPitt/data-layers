With her head slightly tilted and
her hand on her hip, Pitt junior
Michelle Caughlin reﬂected on the
mysterious mural that looms over stu-
dents as they eat in the new Cathedral

"It looks aged, like it could be
retouched to make it look more con-
temporary to attract more people," she
ﬁnally said, in a critical tone.

The painting, entitled "The
Norseman," was discovered last semes-

For The Pitt News

For the next 10 years, Pitt students
searching for a soft drink from
University-run dining facilities or vend-
ing machines will be able to purchase
only Pepsi products.

This will give students more drink
choices, new vending and soft-drink
equipment, and more chances for free
products at special events. Director of
Food Services Betsy Sallade-Farina
said three main criteria contributed to
making this change: price, service and
free products.

"We negotiated some amount of
free products that we can administer to
students for events. There is a certain
amount of product locked in," said

Sallade-Farina. "I think it's something

we can work out to the students’ advan-
tage."

Before, student organizations need-
ing free products for special events had
to solicit support from various compa-
nies, usually working through Sallade—
Farina to find a company willing to
underwrite costs.

Sallade-Farina can begin to allot
free soft drinks or T—shirts as student
groups request support for events such
as pep rallies or pregame activities.

Improved service comes in the
form of new equipment and a greater
range of products. In addition to its
colas, Pepsi carries Ocean Spray juices
and several types of soda including gin-
ger ale, Mug Root Beer, Slice and
Mountain Dew.

In dining facilities, the new elec-
tronically ‘calibrated equipment is
meant to monitor drink taste. Pepsi also
provided new beverage cases ‘for its
Ocean Spray juices and bottled water.

Valulet can’t escape unsafe
reputation with new name

Across the Nation

CLEVELAND — The airline that used
to be called ValuJet is still being called
dangerous.

Federal inspectors have found a num-
ber of safety—related violations at what is
now known as AirTran Airlines. Among
the problems: falsified documents,
improper maintenance, faulty repairs and
repeated failures to supervise contractors.

The ﬁndings are in Federal Aviation
Administration documents obtained by
Cleveland's Plain Dealer newspaper.
They were based on a three—week inspec-
tion in October and November. The viola-
tions are more serious than the ones that
prompted inspectors to recommend the
airline be grounded two years ago.

Despite the recommendation, ValuJet
kept ﬂying until after the May 1996 crash
of one of its jets in the Florida Everglades.

BOULDER, Colo. —— An overlooked
ﬂashlight may be a new clue in the Jon
Benet Ramsey slaying.

Time magazine says the ﬂashlight
recently turned up in an evidence bin at
Boulder, Co. police headquarters. It’s
now being tested.

Time magazine says the ﬂashlight
was found on the kitchen counter-in the
Ramsey home on the day the 6-year-old
beauty queen was found slain.

The magazine says police suspect the
heavy, black ﬂashlight could have been
used to inﬂict Jon Benet’s severe skull
fracture. -

Authorities have said Jon Benet’s
parents remain under an “umbrella of sus-
picion.” But Boulder District Attorney
Alex Hunter is quoted in The New Yorker

NEW YORK —— There’s a report that
lawyers for the Justice Department and
Theodore Kaczynski have reopened plea-
bargain talks.

Newsweek quotes a Justice
Department ofﬁcial as saying Attorney
General Janet Reno may not want to risk
a circus trial if the alleged Unabomber is
allowed to represent himself.

Federal prosecutors earlier turned
down an offer to have Kaczynski plead
guilty in return for a life sentence. The
government is seeking the death penalty.

Justice Department sources say if a
deal is to be worked out now, Kaczynski’s

‘lawyers will have to give up their demand

that they still be allowed to appeal the
sentence.

Kaczynski will undergo a psychiatric
exam this week to determine if he is com-
petent to stand trial and defend himself.

WASHINGTON — A scientist who says
he wants to clone people seems unfazed
by criticism.

Richard Seed says he’s got enough
money to start his project but is still talk-
ing to other potential contributors. He told
“Fox News Sunday” that he has encour-
aged that they don’t always slam the door
in his face.

Yesterday, President Clinton called
Seed’s plan “untested and unsafe and
morally unacceptable.” Clinton said it is
clearer than ever that Congress needs to
ban human cloning.

There is movement in Congress to do
just that. House Majority Leader Dick
Armey told Fox that God created man in
his own image, and he added, “We don’t
need a bunch of amateurs down here

as saying he can’t make a case against the doing what they think they can do.”

Rarnseys at this point.

would not go to a helmet, but I wouldn't
‘ want to tell someone else what to do."

It is not known whether a helmet would
have saved the life of either Kennedy or
Bono, but it does seem that winter athletes
of varying ages are becoming more interest-
ed in wearing them.

Jason Hanlon, a salesperson at W1lli's
Ski Shop at Seven Springs ski resort, has
recently ﬁelded more inquiries about the
once-novel idea of a ski helmet.

"Every year people are becoming more
and more interested in helmets," said
Hanlon. "Parents are getting them for their
kids, and the snowboarders are also wearing
them more. We're also seeing a greater num-
ber of older skiers wearing helmets."

The most common injuries that Hanlon
sees on the slopes and nails are knee

"These types of injuries usually happen
to beginners when they cross their skis,"
Hanlon said. He stresses, however, that
more serious accidents can occur.

"Last year during a race a skier plowed
headlong into a tree. The helmet cracked,
but he was okay. It deﬁnitely saved his life."

Frank Bruno, a snowboarder and
owner of ProSource Bicycles in
Bloomﬁeld, sees a direct correlation with
bicycle—helrnet safety.

"Ten years ago nobody wore a helmet
when riding their bicycle. Today, it's rare to
see a rider without one," Bruno said.

Bruno agrees with Hanlon that in the
years to come the $90-200 helmets will
become as common to skiers on the slopes
as they are to riders on the road or trail.

PAINTING

ter buried behind a wall in the former Roy
Rogers restaurant.

The artist and origins of the 10-foot-
wide and 6—foot—high painting are still
unknown, but Ken Service, Pitt
spokesperson and one of the first people to
see the painting when it was discovered,
said that it may have been on the wall

' when the Cathedral opened in the late

1930s.

"l've received phone calls from alum-
ni who went to school during that time
who remember seeing the mural," he said.
Service also believes the last sighting of
the painting was 15 to 20 years ago.

The name is written along the bottom
of the painting, but Kirk Savage, assistant
professor in the University's art and archi-

tecture department, believes it may have
been added later.

"The painting features Indians, and
the title actually doesn't describe the paint-
ing," he said. "‘Norseman’ refers to
Vikings." .

Betsy Sallade—Farina, director of food
services, believes it was a govemment-
commissioned painting during the Great
Depression.

"Most artists doing government com-
missioned work didn't sign their names on
their paintings," she said. 0

Sallade—Farina says she has also
received phone calls from people who
remember the painting.

"Most people wish it was still cov-
ered," she joked. "But the community is

glad it was preserved."

The painting's discovery generated
interest in other parts of the country as
well. An Associated Press story ran in
many newspapers and The Chronicle of
Higher Education, a national magazine,
also featured a story on the mural. Service
says he's received phone calls about the
painting from people as far south as
Florida.

Sallade—Farina said Christine Dalton,
a mural renovation expert from the
Westmoreland Museum, will clean the
painting. The painting has been discolored
from ketchup stains and years of cigarette
smoke. The cleaning will take place over
spring break and cost an estimated $2,000.

"My first impression of the painting
was that it was interesting and worth pre-
serving," Sallade—Farina said.

said.

Sallade—Farina also said the painting
will be updated and that other similar
works will be added to tie in with the mod-
ern theme of the cafe.

Despite all the interest the painting
has received, it’s not worth very much
money.

"It was made for one space and can't
be moved, so it's not marketable," Savage
said.

According to Service, the University
has stopped researching the painting’s
background.

"We're not actively pursuing it right
now, but we will follow up on any infor-
mation that is given to us," he said. "But as
of now the painting remains a mystery."

They'll buy out your Congress from under you

Michael Berquist

Columnist

Over the last few months, I’ve
grown armoyed by all of the
Washington politicians dodging
questions about our campaign-
ﬁnance system. Instead of ﬁxing
ﬂaws exposed in the last election
with the ways we fund our political
campaigns, our elected representa-
tives have done their best to duck the
question altogether. What’s worse is
that the American people have
shown so little interest in such a vital
issue. Something must be done soon
because our campaign ﬁnance sys-
tem is a complete disgrace.

While working in Washington,
D.C. last summer as an intern for a
U.S. congressman, I was astounded
to see just how much mail congres-
sional oﬂices receive from special
interest groups, and just how little
they receive from private citizens.

Mail from the tobacco lobby
asking the congressman to protect
tobacco subsidies. Mail from the
National Timber Association plead-'
ing for him to support a logging bill.
The list goes on. There isa lobby for
just about every special-interest
group under the sun.

Sadly, while these groups are
making their voices heard in
Washington, you have no real say in
what goes on down there. There
isn’t a National Association of
Working Americans or any lobby
protecting the needs of America’s
forgotten middle class. So the sys-
tem keeps chugging along, vicious-
ly destroying good ideas and pro-
tecting the status quo at any cost.

The inﬂuence of these special-
interest groups has made a real dif-
ference in the quality of representa-
tion the American people have in the

halls of power. In the past several
years we have lost some of our most
intelligent leaders, innovators who
fought to forge compromises and
make the system work, because they
became sick and tired of working in
atsystem that rewards money and
power over hard work and good
ideas. Those who remain are forced
to beg‘ for money from donors
instead of doing what the public has
elected them to do — represent us.

The rules of our campaign-
ﬁnance system have contributed to
the low quality of debate that
plagues politics today. .In the last
several elections, special-interest
groups have consistently exploited a
loophole in the carnpaign-ﬁnance
laws that actually encourages
groups to run negative ads against
candidates by letting them use “issue
ads” — thinly veiled attacks on rival
candidates. Our campaign laws
actually force candidates to do noth-
ing but run negative attack ads and
punish them if they attempt to show
positive ads. The old adage that no
good deed goes unpunished has
never been truer than in the cam-
paign laws.

Prepare for more of the same in
1998. Reports show that incumbents
going for re—election next year are
amassing record sums of money and
will bury their underfunded foes in a
deluge of negative advertising. In
1996, candidates spent a staggering
$790.5 million (62 percent by
republicans).

Billionaire Steve Forbes spent
$30,000 for every vote he received
in his 1996 run for the presidency.
Experts expect the 1998 election to
easily shatter the 1996 record.
Money rules.

By electing the current

Congress, the American people did-
THE PITT NEWS

n’t get change. They merely traded
in one set of special-interest groups
for another. The AFL-CIO, the
Christian Coalition, and similar lob-
bies now wield the real power in
Washington, D.C. Their lobbyists
takelegislation designed to make
government more ﬂexible and more
responsive to the public and lard it_
up with goodies for their constituen-
cies.

Alas, you won’t ﬁnd refonn on
the agenda of this Congress. Newt
Gingrich, for example, seems to
think that our political campaigns
needmore money —— a bizane idea
akin to saying that an alcoholic can
cure his problem by doubling the
amount of hard liquor he drinks.

At a recent meeting with CEOs
of powerful companies, Gingrich
demanded that two—thirds of all cor-
porate money be funnelled to the

Republican Party -—— a tactic one v

would expect to see Don Corleone
employ rather than a man who styles
himself as the American version of
Winston Churchill. One Gingrich
aide explained the tacit agreement
reached at the meeting: “The com-
panies that did not listen won’t get
our ear when they need favors.” In
other words, while this Congress is
considering its interests, it won’t be
considering yours.

VV1th the power that money
holds in politics today, it is certainly
debatable whether we really live in a
democracy. It is up to the American‘
people — YOU -—— to write‘ our
elected representatives and demand
that they put away the smoke and
mirrors and move to reform our
campaign-ﬁnance system. The time
is now.

Michael Berquist is fed up-with a
system that doesn’t work.

Antonelli

It’s all about politics. You can’t see
the danger, but you know it’s there. When
you’re just starting out, you don’t even
know who your allies are. Your own men-
tor could turn out to be your worst enemy.

Welcome to the dean search at Pitt,
where a committee has submitted three
names to the provost for a ﬁnal decision.
Two are outsiders who would enter a
volatile enviromnent alone and unarmed.
The other is John Cooper, former chair of
our chemistry department. He’ll still face
a mineﬁeld, but a familiar one.

That familiarity — and the much-
needed stability it would bring the Arts
and Sciences — should count in his favor,
and he should be chosen dean.

Stability?s a word Pitt’s adrr1inistra—
tion needs to add to its vocabulary.

Believe it or not, our board of trustees
did something right '— it named Mark
Nordenberg chancellor in 1996. Since

school operates.

understanding and people skills. Staff and
students knew him, liked him, respected
him. No matter what qualiﬁcations the

other candidates had, we can’t put a value c

on the biggest asset Nordenberg brought

_this school — stability.

Pitt has now reached another cross-
roads. When current dean Peter Koehler
steps down, he’1l leave a heap of unre-
solved issues as high as the pile of laundry
spewing out of the basket in my closet.

First, there’s the undergraduate cur-
riculum review under way. That issue has
been left mostly to David Brumble, the
undergraduate dean, who spent months
holding meetings with faculty and stu-
dents to note their concerns with the cur-
rent requirements. Out of those discus-
sions, he formulated a plan that would
replace many of the current requirements
with so-called clusters of courses.

When certain departments heard his
plan and thought they might lose students
if certain requirements disappeared, such
outrage swelled up that the plan — and all
discussions — have been stalled. Say the
philosophy department thinks it will lose
undergraduates if its requirement gets nul-
liﬁed. Without undergraduates, the depart-
ment can’t justify spending as much
money on its graduate students.
Philosophy freaks out and whines to for-
eign culture-heavy departments, which
then complain as well.

 

hltp:IIInrww.pItt.eduI ~ pm:

All moaning, no other plans pro-
posed. The wheels of progress, or at least
cooperation, come grinding to a halt.
Brumble doesn’t seem to know what to do
about it.

What’s his new supervisor going to
do? Well, an outside candidate will have
to spend months listening to everyone’s
brouhaha, take another month thinking it
over, get sidetracked for another semester
and then ask someone else to do it.

Cooper, on the other hand, already
knows all this. The downtime would be
signiﬁcantly lessened between now and
when talks resume. His department,
Chemistry, doesn’t stand as much to lose
from clusters because many of its‘under-
graduates are science majors. But after
serving on so many University comrr1it—
tees, he knows it’s political suicide to just
pass or ax a plan based on one depart-
ment.

Second, for anyone who missed it,
this University almost said eulogies for 11
graduate student programs T last spring.
Cooper served on the faculty advisory
committee that prevented this from hap-
pening (at least for the time being) and set
up a new plan that includes continuous
reviews of all departments. If these
departments don’t do better in terms of
standards like undergrad enrollment and
cooperation in joint programs with other
departments, they could lose funding and

never “improve.”

How’s an outsider supposed to learn
all about every department in time to per-
form these reviews and really understand
the results — just numbers on a page, stu-
dents never met, classes never observed?

There’s another complication here as
well -— a number of department chairs got
their egos trampled on when identiﬁed as
a department that could be cut. As pro-
ceedings continued, they complained
about unclear measurement standards,
about humanities being singled out (nine
of the 11 identified departments were
humanities, and more than half the
humanities area was identiﬁed), and about
the process not being fair.

Someone new, frankly, won’t know
enough about the people involved not to
worsen a bad situation — one where some
people still blame the current dean and
some the provost. This University is
divided over the politics of these two top-
ics, and now no outsider could possibly
maneuver around the personnel obstacles,
no matter how smart she seems.

Sometimes change is needed, but
sometimes, as with Mark Nordenberg, all
you need is a little stability.

Coach Cowher a
class act

Class.

.It’s something that is all too often rniss—
ing in sports today. Class is the primary
ingredient in the slowly disappearing recipe
that is sportsmanship.

Taunting and showboating on the part
of the players is, unfortunately, an expected
part of the game. But classless behavior on
the part of coaches is just despicable. Teams
reﬂect the attitude of their coaches, and if
good sportsmanship is going to survive at
all, coaches need to realize the responsibili-
ty they hold.

You don’t need to look any farther than
this season’s saga between the Steelers and
Broncos to see the stark contrast between a
classy coach and a classless one.

The Steelers lost a heartbreaker that
they could have won easily to the Broncos
24-21 in yesterday’s AFC championship
game.

After the game, Steelers Head Coach
Bill Cowher did the classy thing and took
his hat olf to the Broncos. He conceded
defeat and did not once attempt to serve up
an excuse.

He instructed his players to do the
same, and as a result, there was virtually no
ﬁnger-pointing or “if—only-this-had-hap-
pen ” talk.

Cowher’s approach after the emotion-
ally devastating loss is especially admirable
when you consider how much there was to
complain about in the game.

It seems the referees forgot that foot-
ball was a contact sport and made two pass-
interferance calls that should be an embar-
rassment to the NFL.

It was obvious to even the most casual
football fan that neither call was really pass
interference. What’s even worse is that both
of those “penalties” led to Denver scores.

But Cowher and his boys never even
once tried to blame the loss on the officials.
They simply acknowledged the fact that
officiating is a subjective part of football
and that it’s up to the team to overcome that
adversity.

Classy.

Cowher and the Steelers never once
mentioned Norm Johnson’s ﬁrst-quarter
missed ﬁeld goal that would have meant a
tied game, or the numerous dropped passes
or stupid interceptions that so often disrupt-
ed the Steelers’ momentum. The Steelers
took the loss like men.

Very classy. Now, let’s hearken back to
Dec. 15. Remember that game?

It’s the game in which Kordell Stewart
and the Steelers stormed from behind to
beat the Broncos 35-24.

Late Panther comeback falls short

Second-half showings
from Lockhart, Hawkins
not enough to push Pitt
Hoops past Providence

Eric Mosley

Staff Wrlter

Vonteego Cummings is sure to set both
Pitt and Big East records during his college
basketball career. And on Saturday night, he
accomplished one of the two feats, setting a
new mark in Big East play.

However, it’s a record that Cummings is
probably not going to boast about.’ The
record he set during the Panthers’ contest at
Providence is the Big East landmark for the
most turnovers ever in conference play.

Cummings, who has led the young
Panther squad in every sense of the word
thus far this season, was frustrated by
Providence guards John Linehan and Corey
Wright, resulting in 12 turnovers in Pitt’s
87-77 loss before 11,098 fans at the
Providence Civic Center.

“It was just a bad game,” Cummings said
following the loss, which dropped the

Thursday night’s game at
West Virginia gave the Pitt
Lady Panther basketball team
a chance for momentum —
momentum going into
Wednesday’s matchup
against the nationally-ranked
Connecticut Huskies.

But instead of pushing
their Big East Conference
winning streak. to two games,
the Panthers (4-9) fell victim
to Mountaineer forward
Talisha Hargis, who scored
19 points in 24 minutes and
led her WVU squad to a 65-
50 victory.

“She’s kind of an uncan-
ny player,” said Pitt Head
Coach Kirk Bruce, when

asked about the Mountaineer
standout. “She’s very good
defensively. Reminds you a
lot of [men’s hoops guard]
Kellii Taylor.”

Like Taylor, Hargis is
best known for her defense
and aggressive play —— espe-
cially driving at the basket
regardless of opposing traffic
in the lane. Nine of her 19
points came from the foul line
in Thursday’s contest, a result
of her drives. Also, Hargis led
all players in steals with three
and defensive rebounds with
seven.

ward combination of Hargis

record 12 by Vonteego Cummings,

offense began to pick up its game as
it scrambled back from a 16 point
deficit to take a two point lead with
just over seven minutes left to play.

Cummings came through defen-
sively to spark the comeback with a
block of Jamel Thomas’ breakaway
lay—up attempt. It was one of
Thomas’ six turnovers on the
evening.

But with Cummings wrapped up
by the Providence defensive press,
the offense didn’t have enough to
overtake the Friars completely.

“We need Vonteego to come
through big every game. He didn’t
play well tonight,” said Head Coach
Ralph Willard of Cummings’ perfor-
mance.

Besides the turnovers, the full-
court press against Cummings
forced him into foul trouble — he
left the game toward the end of the
second half. 8 \

Providence freshman John
Linehan made two of his nine steals
in the final three minutes of the
game to reverse Pitt’s momentum
and give Providence the win.
Linehan also hit all 10 of his foul

. shots toward the end of the second

half to put away the Panthers.

Pitt’s Jarrett Lockhart recorded
all 12 of his points in the second
half, leading the Panther comeback
and committing just two turnovers
for the contest.

The Panthers weren’t the only
ones getting their pockets picked,
though -— Pitt had 15 steals of its
own, including five by Cummings.
The Panthers also held a 28-27
rebounding edge but couldn’t get the
offense going with Cummings shut
down.

“I think the 15 turnovers in the
first half killed us. That was the crit-
ical point. We fought back well in
the second half but we turned the
ball over three times,” said Coach
Willard.

The Panthers came within eight
turnovers of breaking their own Big
East record; the Panthers turned the

’ ball over 35 times in a game against

Georgetown in 1995.

The 27 turnovers also equalled
last year’s in-conference record, set
on three different occasions with
Connecticut, West Virginia and
Miami each hitting the mark. Pitt’s
28 turnovers versus non-conference
rival Duquesne last season was the
most of any Big East team.

Cummings’ 12 miscues also
bests last season’s Big East record of
11, set by both Seton Hal1’s Shaheen
Holloway and Villanova’s Alvin
Williams. Holloway’s nine turnovers
in a Dec. 8 game versus the Panthers
last season was the conference-game
high of 1996-1997.

Woods 28 to nine. Toney finished the
game with four fouls and, due to early
foul trouble, Woods (three fouls)

played just 16 minutes in the contest.

Coming off the bench to spell
Woods was Pitt freshman Kenosha
Chastang, who led all Panthers with 1]
points in the contest. The 6-foot-4 for-
ward also pulled down 14 rebounds,
another team—leading total, besting the
12 boards of 6-7 center Nickeia
Morris.

Coach Bruce said that Chastang’s
performance was a much-needed
boost for the squad, and that having a
fresh 6-4 player to plug in late in the
game will help the squad underneath
in upcoming contests.

“Eleven points and 14 rebounds,
that’s a nice game for a freshman post
player,” Bruce said. “And she’s had a
lot of games like that for us.”

Morris and guard Gina Montesano
led all Pitt starters with eight points
each. Morris, a sophomore who did
not start against Connecticut last sea-
son, is ready for the Huskies on
Wednesday.

“You always just want to be opti-

mistic,” Morris said. “The whole team

feels that way.”

Montesano, however, may not be
ready. She has missed the team’s last
two practices after having an ingrown
toenail removed. Bruce said that her
status for the UConn game was still up
in the air, but she would have to be at
100 percent for the Lady Panthers to
challenge the nation’s third-ranked
team.

To combat UConn, Bruce has
installed a new zone defense over the
past week of practices. The 2-3 zone is
a departure from Pitt’s usual scheme

_— a man-on-man setup or what

Morris called “a matchup zone.”

Bruce said he hopes the 2-3 will
help Pitt contain Connecticut’s
perimeter game, especially the play of
Husky letter-winner
Nykesha Sales. Sales scored 23 points
on the Panthers in a Feb. 19 game last
season.

On offense, the Panthers look to
use their height advantage, with
Morris, Chastang and Woods (6-2)
leading the attack. According to

THE PITT NEWS

COLUMN

actions after that game serve as a stark
contrast to Cowher’s commendable
behavior.

After a slow start in the game, the
Steelers dominated and the Broncos
choked. But instead of acknowledging the
Steelers’ superior play that day, weasel
Shanahan had more excuses than a high-
school attendance ofﬁce.

Shanahan insisted that if it were not
for his team’s 12 dropped passes, they
could have easily dominated the Steelers.

He assured the media that if his team
wasn’t so banged up, and if his receivers
had held on to those balls, his Broncos
could have had 500-plus yards of offense.

Yeah, Coach Shanahan, and ifcaribou
were people instead of 500—pound smelly

animals and if a hundred of them had polit-
ical science degrees and if they were elect-
ed, the United States could have an all-
caribou Senate (imagine the headlines).

Saying the Broncos could have won
had it not been for those dropped passes is
like saying the Pirates could have won had
they not given up all those home runs.

Dropping passes is bad football, just
like giving up home runs is bad baseball.
But throwing out all of those “what—ifs”
falls into the ﬁrst level of classlesness. But
Coach Mikey didn’t stop there; he man-
aged to behave even more like a sixth-
grader.

Shanahan publicly criticized Cowher
for his emotional, in-your-face and on—the—
ﬁeld style of coaching. What the hell does

9

Shanahan care about how Cowher coach-
es? It doesn’t affect him one bit.

Even if Cowher decided to hold prac-
tices at the Phipps Conservatory and
instructed his players to wear
Rollerblades, what does Shanahan care?
Shanahan’s job is to prepare the Broncos
to play football. If he thinks the methods
Cowher uses to prepare the Steelers to
play are wrong, he should prove it on the
football ﬁeld.

Bill Cowher is a classy football coach
and a classy person. Mike Shanahan is a
weasel. Cowher has earned the respect of
players and coaches all across the league,
and next year, should the two teams clash
again, I like the Steelers’ chances.

Brian Knavish is a columnist for The Pitt
News and thinks that Mike Shanahan
looks like a gecko.

“Providence did a good job of
taking Vonteego out of the game,”
Willard said. “Vonteego let them
frustrate him, and he didn’t make a
lot of smart decisions with the bas-

didn’t have a lot of help out there

Cummings was not the only
Panther to turn the ball over,
though. Pitt as a team combined to

“Obviously, 27 turnovers is way
too many,” Willard said. “We’ve
been doing a pretty good job taking
care of the basketball this season,
but give Providence credit, they did
a good job of taking Vonteego out
of the game. Their guards played
him very physical and did a good
job of pressuring him and keeping
him from getting the ball back once
he gave it up.”

half.

allowing the Friars to go on a 19-0
run to give them an 18-point lead,
31-13. But the Panthers hung on
and only trailed 40-30 at the half.

The Panthers continued to fight L

in the second half, attacking the
undersized Friars with their inside
play. Sophomore forward Isaac
Hawkins, who scored a career high
22 points and grabbed 11 rebounds,
and freshman center Attila Cosby,
who added 16 points, dominated the
second half to help the Panthers
eventually take a two-point lead.

“Every team is going to kill us
inside,” Providence Head Coach
Pete Gillen said. “We just don’t
have enough big guys.”

Pitt’s two-point lead did not last
very long. The Friars, especially
guards Linehan and Kendrick
Moore, stepped up and made the

plays with the game on the line.

“When we came back to take the
lead, we seemed to exhale,” Willard
said. ‘l‘Providence regrouped as a
team.”

Monday, 12 January 1998

Pitt could not even get a lift
from injured sophomore guard
Kellii Taylor, who played only four
minutes and did not score. The
Panthers, however, got another
strong three—point showing from
guard Jarrett Lockhart, whose two
three-pointers in the second half
helped the Panthers make their run
to take a brief lead. Freshman
Ricardo Greer added 11 points for
Pitt.

Providence was led by Linehan,
who made two of his nine steals in
the final three minutes of play, and
nailed 10 of his 10 shots from the
charity stripe down the stretch.

The win raises Providence’s
record to 6-7 overall, 1-3 in Big
East action.

“This game was more guts and
heart than strategy,” Gillen said.
“We could have quit, but we did-
n’t.”

The Panthers are idle until next
Saturday night, when they host
Rutgers at the Fitzgerald Field
House.
