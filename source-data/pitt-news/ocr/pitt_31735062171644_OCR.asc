/1 Special Jssuc Examining the Ezrllcgc’ Press

On many campuses. the college news-
paper is the principal means of communi-
cation. Although these publications are not
intended to be representative of student
opinion. that is sometimes what students
and administrators expect.

Because the student newspaper is often
the prime source of information and opin—
ion on campus events and trends. its impor-
tance as a medium is paramount. Inevit-
ably. it becomes a target.

Some of the most controversial campus
issues revolve around the student newspa-
per. This has become more apparent in re-
cent _vears as various factions within uni-
versities around the country have attempt-
ed to either censor or control the campus
press.

There have been several instances in
;,which the attempts have been met with a
considerable amount of success.

In one of the more recent incidents.
the administration at Pennsylvania State
University successfully removed the edi-
tor and a reporter for what they consider-

—mE KENTSTATEIQ .

ed an improper means of obtaining news.
In situations like this. the autonomy of the
student newspaper is at stake.

It is one of the purposes of this special
supplement to briefly acquaint the read-
ers of The Pitt News with some of the prob-
lems that confront the staff of a campus
organ during the course of its publication.

We have attempted, in this edition, to
study the impact of the student newspaper
through examination of not only The Pitt
News. but of other college publications
around the country.

As a basis of comparison with other col-
lege papers. the supplement has dealt with
not only the journalistic aspects of vari-
ous publications leg. the occasional intru-
sion of bias into news stories). but with
the conflicts. the constraints. and the pres-
sure under which a student paper must
function.

Almost invariably. cultural clashes
arise between college journalists and other
members of the University community.
with threatened resorts to censorship and

control acting as catalysts.

Lately, at this University, the clashes
have not traditionally been with the admin-
istration, but with student based groups.
Such an incident occurred here when
groups of ROTC students allegedly seized
large quantities of the now defunct maga-
zine Alternatives as a means of protesting
the content.

At times like these and in the course of
day to day publications, college journal-
ism becomes a lesson in power politics.
Editorials or intentionally biased news
stories are sometimes used by individual
students. student groups. and administra-
tive representatives eager to propagate
their own viewpoints.

The political angle can be extended to
encompass the unending haggles over who
should control the power of the purse
strings. In most instances the monies are
scrutinized either by the administration or
a student based group such as student gov-
ernment allocations committees.

Once again the question of the paper’s
autonomy arises, most notably in cases
when the financial controllers make de-
mands upon the content of the publication.

In this edition, we have attempted to of-
fer samples of the best in campus journal-
ism, to focus on typical problems, and fin-
ally to suggest alternatives and possible
solutions.

It is hoped that the reprints of stories
from other campus papers may serve to
make the readers aware of some central
issues at other schools, in addition to of-
fering a brief sampling of different jour-
nalistic styles.

This supplement was conceived and pro-
duced by members of Lee Gutkind’s Eng-
lish 95 class, all of whom write for the
Pitt News.

Contributors include Laura Ayres, Bob
Donaldson, Virginia Joyce, Bill Gormley.
Steve Lubetsky, Don Marbury, Mike Mill-
er, Cindy Morgan, Mike Simon, and Dana
Ventriglia. Sketches on pages one, two and
three were done by Joyce Porostosky.

How Student Newspapers Throughout

Campus Editors are Suspended and lnterrogated,

The CFIC further proposed
that, as general practice, a dis-
claimer be printed on the mast
to distinguish “official Univer-
sity policy from student opin-
ion.”

Obscenity Charge

Unilateral removal of the edi-
tor of the Purdue Exponent by
the University President in No-
vember, 1968, touched off a
campus controversy which in-
cluded classroom demonstra-

tions in support of deposed edi-

tor William Smoot, III. President
Frederick L. Hovde. basing his
decision on the “nonrepresenta-
tion” charge, objected to the
use of four letter words in the
Exponent. The Board of Trus-
tees seconded his motion.

A tripartite Review Board
acted as arbiter and rendered a
decision that is currently serv-
ing as the model for at least
three other newspapers.

The Board strongly urged that
(1) the lines of authority gov-
erning content control be clari-
fied; (2) a disclaimer be used:
(3) the Exponent investigate the
viability of incorporation and
(4) a student newspaper be
“functionally defined" for the
protection of all involved.

A presidential censorship at-
tempt at Fitchburg State College
two years later ended up in the
U.S. District Court of Massa-
chusetts. The case was enter-
ed for formal litigation after
President James Hammond. ob-
jecting the publication of Eld-
ridge Cleavers essay. Black
Moocliie as obscene. cut the
funding of Fitchburgs The Cy-
cle.

The subsequent decision by
Justice J. Garrity provides an
important legal precedent safe-

Funding iscut, Publications are Burned and Stolen

guarding the rights of the cam-
pus editor.

No Confinement

In essence. the February 1970.
ruling stated that” having fos-
tered a campus newspaper. the
state may not arbitrarily impose
restrictions on the matter to be
communicated. Students may not
be confined to sentiments that
are officially approved."

It figured significantly in the
successful defense of the edi-
tors of Mississippi States cam-
pus paper. The Reflector. An
editorial concerning the “death
of god" carried by the student
newspaper prompted the Board
of Trustees to appoint faculty
editors “for the purpose of edi-
tingstudent publications before
they are sent to be printed.“

Editor in chief Grady Thur-
man said in an interview that the
editors had planned to sue the
state for breach of the Garrity
decision if the Trustees‘ Nov-
ember 20 move were not revers-
ed.

Immediately before the end
of the past term. however. the
Board met to change it collec-
tive mind and reinforce the au-
tonomy of the editorial staff.

Direct censorship by Boards
of Trustees. is rare and much
less frequent than editorial and

financial handcuffing by col-
lege presidents.
Several states. notably Cali-

fornia. carry statutes that invest

the president with nearly auto-

nomous control of all campus
organizations. The West Coast
state's Education Code provid-
es that "a student body organi-
zation may be established at

ervision of the college‘ officials

Lawmakers and Judges

State legislative and judicial
bodies are moving increasing-
ly into the censorship lime light
and. notwithstanding the Gar-
rity ruling. they usually sup-
port presidential charges. When.
the editor of the Minnesota
Daily was arrested for printing
obscene material. several state
legislators there tried unsuccess-
fully to push through a cut in
the university‘s appropriations.

When Pitts administration fail-
ed to officially reprimand the
editors of the magazine Alterna-
tives for "publishing obscene
remarks about President Nixon"
in 1969. a few Pennsylvania leg-
islators called for reductions in
state subsidies to the school.

condemnation from metropolitan
newspapers. Judge Lloyd Weav-
er of nearby Clarion County's
Common Pleas Court publicly
interrogated the editor of Clar-

handled by an outside agency

Student Censorship

Despite the frequent occur-

Outsiders Use Pursestring Powers1i.¥i}f;
To Straitiacket College Papers

Although 20 per cent of the nations college
newspapers are financially independent. the vast
majority are not so fortunate.

.\Iost college newspapers find advertising and
circulation revenue inadequate. To balance their
budgets. they must rely upon subsidies from student
government and. or the administration.

Without aid. few could survive. With aid. how-
ever. come problems. Administrators and student
government heads sometimes threaten to cut the
newspaper‘s pursestrings. particularly when they
are criticized in print.

The dilemma is aptly described by a Special
(fornmission on the Student. Press: “The question
of whether students. and the university. should be
forced to finance a publication with which they dis-
agree and over which they‘ have little Control is be-
ing asked with increasing frequency.“

FAIR BARGAIN

College newspaper editors argue that they tul-
fill their side of the bargain so long as they cover
events fairly and keep the university community
well informed.

Student governments occasionally complain.
however. that the campus press is not reflecting
the views of the student body. And administrators
sometimes object to what they consider innaccurate
or distasteful journalism.

Naturally, college newspapers prefer autono-
my to dependence. Insulated from political pres-
sure, they can make policy decisions without fear or
reprisal and freely pursue journalistic excellence,
as they define it.

The fight for journalistic independence has
been led by the Ivy League newspapers. Harvard.
Yale. Princeton. Dartmouth. and Cornell are now
self-sufficient.

Over the past two years. the Boston University
News has successfully severed its ties with its ad-

ministration and Student Government.

But for most college newspapers. independence
is impossible. The Pitt News investigated the pos-

 

sibility last year. but found that it wasn‘t feasible. '

disert. a Trustee. concluded that if The Pitt News‘.
is to be distributed free of charge. continued assis '
tance will be necessary. —

  The Pitt News: To Be Eight-Paged Into Nothingness

One of The Pitt News news
editors has a long list of back-
logged news stories, many of
which deal with some impor-
tant campus or student happen-
ing you will never know about.
If by chance some deadline
night, he finds that there is
room for one or two of them.
they will be so dated they will
no longer be of importance to
the readership.

The Entertainment editor
comes to the editor of the news-
paper to tell him of the many
new ideas and subjects that she
would like to add to the paper,
but soon finds that an occasion-
ally movie review is all she
will be able to contribute from
her staff.

The feature editor reaches a .

point of exasperation where he
doesn’t even bother to assign
many of the story ideas he
gets, because he realizes that
the chances of him getting
more than one feature a week
in, is very unlikely.

Pitt News photography staff-
ers call editorial members into
a special meeting to complain
about how their pictures were
being “cropped”. Here we are
going out and trying to take
the most interesting and best
pictures that we can," one
photographer commented. “and
when we give them to you
(the news staff) they are ‘but-
chered into one-half column
cuts (usually the smallest-sized
picture used."

FINANCIAL CENSORSHIP
The Pitt News is not plag-

‘ued by many of the forms of

censorship outlined in this spe-
cial issue, but we are censored.
although more subtly, devious-
ly and indirectly.

We are censored, because we
do not have the money to make
this the kind of paper we want
and that we feel the students of
this campus, need, expect, and
are entitled to have.

The Pitt News is one of. if
not the most important organi-
zation on campus. and provide
a much need service to a large
body of people in and around
the University.

We are the only student or-
ganization which generates a
large part of its on revenue to
underwrite its budget.

We mold and stimulate cam-
pus opinion, are a voice for stu-

.dent thought and plus inform

the student of just what is go-
ing on in his school.

Every year we have been
chosen as an All-American
College Newspaper. the high-
est rating possible by the Col-
legiate Press Service, and each
year in national college news-
paper contests. Pitt News ar-
ticles take more than their
share of victories.

Yet, this ybar we have been
forced to put out a paper lack-
ing in many important things.
because we just didn‘t have the
money to do so.

It would seem that an organ-
ization as important to the Uni-
versity, as the Pitt News would
be taken care of enough that it
could do the best possible ser-
vice to the University commun-
ity that it could.

NO SPACE

The whole problem is that
we do not have enough money
to afford printing as large en-
ough paper — to cover the news
and other items, which we feel
are of importance to the Uni-
versity and University commun-

_ ity adequately.

This fact is a form of indir-
ect censorship in that we are
limited to the stories and many
different angles to a story.
which we can fit in the paper.
During the Fall term of 1970
and continuing this term. if
we had a lot of features pic-
tures. and opinions and news
stories. of great importance to
the reader. which because of
space limitations. were greatly
abridged or many not run at all.
Stories that we felt the student
should be informed of were
presented skeletally. or too late
to carry the importance that
they should have.

We contend that this dis-
tracted from the quality of our
publication, and injured our
position as a voice for student
opinion.

pm News reporters put many
hours into stories. but so many
of them never reach the read-
er.

Is it not naive to think that
a campus this size can be cov-
ered adequately by an eight
page paper? In a paper that
size. page four would be de-
voted to student opinion and
editorials; page five. Letters
to the Editor; pages six and
seven. sports. (which is now
covering six winter sports.)
and pages one. two and
three, divided among the En-1
tertainment. Feature. News.
and Photography staffs.

You must realize to, that only

‘the business

page one and four of a paper
this size are devoid of ads.
Page eight would be a full
page ad, and the other pages
filled with ads.

Because of a large drop in
national advertisements. the
Pitt News business manager has
informed the staff members
that the papers will have to be
small or we will lose too much
money on each issue. Even
when they have been eight
pages long (usually the small-
est during regular terms.) we
have been losing money.

$52,900 in off-campus adver-
tising and subscriptions sold by
Pitt News business staffers was
anticipated for this school
year. It is very unlikely that
we will reach that figure. so
manager must
keep expenses as low as he
possibly can. Printing expen-
ses is our largest bill. so
this naturally. is one of the first
cutbacks. or in other words.
smaller papers.

IN DEFENSE OF SALARIES

“Pitt News people are cry-
ing the blues about not hav-
ing enough money to do things
with the paper. but they have
the nerve to pay their people
salaries for the work that they
put
activity." Is this fair?"

How do we answer a com-
ment like that one‘?

In the Spring of 1970, Chan-
cellor Wesley Posvar asked
Judge Ruggero Aldisert, a Pitt
Trustee, to head a committee
which would undertake a study
of a student publications at the
University and make recom-
mendations to improve the
role and quality of these pub-
lications.

One of the statements which
came out of the committee stat-
ed. “No formal agreement be-
tween the administration and
the student journalist will work
unless the administrator is
willing to consider the news-
paper and educational project.
guaranteeing the student journa-
list the same freedom to pur-
sue truth as is granted to all
students. What position can a
man of reason maintain toward
the student press? He can take
to it essentially the same atti-
tude he takes toward other edu-
cational enterprise on campus:
the desire to assist through mo-
ral and FINANCIAL means the
education of the students.

After extensive research on
what other college newspaper

in on an extracurricular»

staff'ers across the country were
paid. a yearly sum of 11.608.50
was set aside for salaries. pay-
able in three payrolls during
each trimester. Payment is
made from the Merit Assistance
Program fund (MAP). The
Student publications advisor
checks all payroll checks and
runs a cost analysis to see that
‘disbursements stay within the
allotted total sum for each pay-
roll period. '

But the salaries we receive
for our work on the Pitt News
are not given because they’re
nice to have. Pitt News salaries
are as important to the quality,
and operation of the paper as
money enough for larger papers
are —' in fact even more so.

Pitt News staffers receive
money‘ because the demands of
the paper are so great. just in
time spent. that without them-
many people. whose services
and work is dependent upon.
would have to get part-time jobs
rather than spend their time
working on the paper.

The editor makes $117 a month
and he spends as many as 40-50
hours a week devoted to Pitt
News work. A top reporter
spends around 20 hrs/per week
on the Pitt News, and the tops he
can get is $40 dollars a month.
(Three reporters received that
much.) The editorial salaries go
down the line with approximate
$10 differences; the lowest be-
ing $60. that‘s for around 30-40
hours of work a week. and sal-
aries go as low as $2.50.

We feel that the quality of the
paper would be impaired if we
did not have this form of com-
pensation.

But how are Pitt News work
compensation and small papers

This summer, members of
the Pitt News guided by Direc-
tor of Publications Mrs. Ester
Kitzes presented a large packet
of information concerning pay-
ment to college newspaper
staffs. to the Student Govern-
ment Allocations Committee.
The packet was well research-
ed; contained precedents for the
request. and outlined how the
money would be used and why.

The Allocations Committee
refused our request for funds
for staff compensation. but were
ordered by the Student Govern-
ment Senate. who voted that we
should receive money for com-
pensation. to give us $5,500 for
the Fall term 1971.

Convinced that the Pitt News
was a special case situation, and
that the paper did need staff
compensation, the SG Senate
promised that some sort of ar-
rangement would be worked out
to see that we got a sum for

compensation each term. The a

Senate did not keep its promise.

The situation now is. that a
sum for Pitt News compensation
will come out of the Student Gov-
ernment Senate budget for the
month of January. but after
that. we must fend for ourselves.

WHAT’S THE DILEMMA

So here is the point that we
have been building up to in this
whole editorial:

Staff compensation and a
large enough paper to adequate-
ly put out the paper are of equal
importance to us. because they
both ultimately affect the quality
of the paper. We no longer will
work with one. without the other.
Both of them are necessary to
put out the kind of paper which
everyone can be proud of, and
get something out of.

The Pitt News will continue to
pay compensation even if we
don’t get any additional monies.
We are going to start putting out-,
a paper, the size needed to stim-
ulate this campus adequately,
even though we will lose money
on every issue.

We will no longer let financial
censorship dictate our (mean-
ing you and us). newspaper.

Unless we do receive more
money the Pitt News will soon
have to cease publication. be-

cause we will simply be broke. “

But up until that time. you‘re go-
ing to get much more of a com-
plete newspaper.

We don’t want to see the Pitt
News die. We love it, or we
wouldn’t even concern ourselves
with it. (God knows the hassles
aren’t worth it.) For Pitt News
staffers are very devoted people
—trying to render a service, but

constantly limited in the per-__

formance of that service.

Two things——compensation and
operational money—operational
and compensation money—The

' Pitt News cannot survive with-

out them. This is your student
newspaper, as well as ours. Will
you support us in our dilemma
when the times comes? When
that time does come the life of
your student newspaper will de-
pend upon that support.

“You Cannot Say That, and Because You Did......”

(Continued from Page 2)

Several thousand copies of the
Alternatives controversial issue.
which included a series of arti-
cles attacking ROTC accredita-
tion. were confiscated a few
ROTC cadets before campus dis-
tribution.

In this instance. however. the
University decided against the
offenders, requiring them to
reimburse the editors. On the
question of the alleged obcen-
ity. a faculty-student Publica-
tions Board dismissed the char-
ges. and reinforced the editors'
right to final judgement.

On a less dramatic scale. stu-
dent censors often operate
through officially sanctioned allo-
cations or student government
finance committees. Of 27 stu-
dent newspapers polled in a
1968 survey. more than 60_‘.T&» per
cent are funded in whole or

part by allocations committees on p

a yearly basis. 1

 

Anti-Decadence

As a by-product of funding. a
Senate controlled Publications
Board was established by the
SG President at Hofstra Univer-
sity. Hempstead. New York. to
prevent the student newspaper.
The Chronicle, from becoming
“decadent."

During the time that the news-
papers budget request was un-
der consideration. the editors
of The Pitt News were forced to
defend their editorial policies
and content decisions to the Al-
locations Committee prior to
funding.

A former director of the Unit-
ed States Student Press Associa-
tion. Robert Johnston. suggested
that a student appropriations
committee will more readily re-
move funds from a student news-
paper to which it objects than
will an administration‘ fearing
for its public image.

Because of its ambiguous posi-

tion as a newspaper. somewhere
between the high school mimeo
and the professional media. the
student press must take steps to
protect its financial autonomy
and editorial integrity. The Pur-
due Review Boards recommen-
dations. seconded by USSPA‘s
Johnston and Californias CFIC.
offer a four point plan:

— The student newspaper, in
order to avoid the legal impli-
cations of officially represent-
ing its university, should print
a disclaimer in its standard mast
to dissociate itself from official
university policy.

— Lines of authority and re-
sponsibility must be clarified.
The Board proposed the estab-
lishment of a democratically pop-
ulated publications board to han-
dle complaints. Although the
Garrity decision protects the
student journalist from arbitra-
ry and‘ unilateral suspension,
other statutes require that some
structured grievance‘ procedure
be operative.

mast disclaimer last September.

   

— The newspaper must enjoy
some degree of financial inde-
pendence. The strongest college
papers, including the Harvard
Crimson. the Yale Daily News.
the Cornell Daily Sun and others
have incorporated as entities sep-
arate from the universities.
Where incorporation is impossi-
ble, Johnston proposes that cam-
pus papers be allocated funds
from student governments on a
contractual basis as opposed to
ad hoc annums.

—— The staff of the paper has
the ultimate responsibility to de-
fine for itself the role and func-
tions of the student press. The
Purdue Review suggested that
“the campus newspaper should
function both to provide notice
and review of campus events and
to stimulate discussion of issues
important to the campus and to
citizenry in general.”

The Pitt News is batting .750
on the scale. having inserted the

Important controversies are han-~

dled by an official albeit infre-
quent1y—-called Publications
Board and the editor formulates
policy with the concurrence of
the editorial board. The news-
papers financial independence
has been strengthened by an
administrative purchase of 4.000
subscriptions. Nevertheless. year-
ly sessions with an ever chang-
ing Allocations Committee are
still the norm.

As a significant precedent.
the Garrity decision has provid-
ed the student editor with the
legal right to define the medi-
um that he or she heads. Neither
the Massachusetts ruling nor
the Purdue document. however.

College Journalism: Objective, Fair, Bi

An important facet of the col-
legiate press is its journalistic
quality. The degree to which col-
lege papers present a clear un-
biased account of revelant events
depends upon a combination of
both writing and layout.

Man of these factors can be
manipulated. sometimes uncon-
sciously. to introduce an element
of bias into a newspaper or news-
paper story.

To examine the quality of col-
lege journalism the following pa-
pers havebeen studied.

The sample includes:
Minnesota Daily
Minnesota). The Daily Collegian
(The Pennsylvania State Univer-
sity). The Kent Stater (Kent State
University). The Miami Hurri-
cane (The University of Miami).
The Hofstra Chronicle (Hofstra
University) and The Oakland
Ridge’ Recorder (The Oakland
Community College of Michigan).

This sample constitutes a cross
section of collegiate periodicals.
Papers from the East Coast, New
England, the Mid West, and the
South were included in the sam-
ple in addition to papers from uni-
versitities, small colleges and
community colleges.

The

Good journalistic writing was
a quality displayed in most of the
sample papers. but elements of
bias were occasionally present in
the layout.

PLACEMENT IMPORTANT

The placement of articles on a
page or in the paper as a whole.
can emphasize a story or play
down its importance. This is how
bias was revealed in the newspa-
papers.

The Hofstra Chronicle employ-
ed this method to emphasize the
paper's financial interests. The

(University of ,

Chronicle’s appropriations were
cut by $1252.50 and this fact was
advertised in the lead story on the
front page. ‘

The story contained facts. but
not all of the facts. The following
statement was attributed to the
Chronicle’s editor.

“This move shows the selfish
character of the majority of the

student senate. We couldn't even
get $600 to feed the staff for the
entire year. The student senate
just spent $550 on their induction
dinner and we work a helluva lot
harder than they do.”

The chairman of the senate
committee was quoted as saying.
"To correct over-appropriations
the total student organizations
budget was severely cut.“ '

Thus the papers views were
aired. but the student senate was
not given a chance to defend itself.

KENT STATE

The impact of the Kent State
killings has left the Daily Kent
Stater with a sense of distorted
priorities. Many stories were dis-
played out of proportion to their
news value.

One paper used the entire front
page and editorial page to repro-
cussions of the incident. Another
issue devoted the entire front
page and all but 12 inches of the
editorial pages to the same sub-
ject.

These stories were extremely
repetitious. consisting of a rehash
of the stories and columns of the
previous day.

The Kent Stater exhibits an im-
balance of stories. There is a
greater emphasis on news stories
and editorials. The paper aver-
ages 12 to 16 pages of news and
editorials and two pages of sports
and little or no features.

The Daily Collegian, however.
differs from these previously

mentioned papers. Its news arti- '

cles are objective and there is a
proper balance of articles. The
Collegian, unlike the others was
a full sized newspaper rather than
a tabloid. The Collegian was able
to devote an entire page to news.
editorial. sports and features.

The Daily Collegian also includ-
ed a segment of the front page de-
voted to national and internation-
al news. as University Park stu-
dents have limited access to other
news media.

BALANCED CONTENT
The Minnesota Daily was an-
other publication which steered
away from biased writing and

contained a good balance of arti-
cles.

The Minnesota Daily advocated if
an editorial policy of being op- '

posed to campus violence. While

giving equal space to stories con- \ .

cerning both sides of the issue.

they were able. through skillful i '
layout. to make this policy evident _

in the news pages without gross-
ly over playing the importance of
these stories.

One paper that was particular-

ly appealing was the Orchard
Ridge Recorder, which proved “

that a large campus with a jour-
nalism school isn't necessary to
produce a good newspaper.

The Recorder has an unusual
and modern format. with interest-
ing layout containing many photos
and illustrations. .,

OPINIONS PAGES
UNLABELLED
The news articles were unbias-
ed but pages of opinion were not
labeled well so a reader might not

be aware of whether he is reading  A

news or opinion.

Bias occurred most often in the
display the articles received

Their importance was emphasiz- . ‘
"ed or‘ de-emphasized by placing

it prominantly on a front page or
burying it on the back page.

Bias was present only when the 0

Campus was affected by a grave
crisis as at the Kent State cam-
pus. or when the papers interests
were at stake. as in the case of the
Hofstra Chronicle.

In the papers studied. the writ-
ing itself was generally free from
bias in the form of opinion pur-
posely injected into the story
through use of connotative words
or misinformation.

Max Orovitz, a convicted fe-
lon, a man .who has been denied
the right to vote in national elec-

If the Board of Trustees limit-
ed themselves to the business
and legal aspects of the govern-
ance of this university we might
have less basis for concern. The

Board, however, does not limit

itself to financial and legal af-

For Dissatisfied Students

Remember when the domes
blew down and the UMass pub-
he lost track of Free Univer-
sity? Well, it‘s still there, and
its members have been active
ever since. Incidentally, for ev-

- eryone's edification, Free Uni-

versity City was pictured in the
Encyclopedia Brittanica under
Student Dissent. So its famous
even if you don’t remember it.

Free U. hid in South College
all last year and did things.
Eight members went in the Sil-
ver Bus last semester and had
educational experiences on the
open road. Cultural revolution,
a central Free U. idea, has been
explored. and in connection with
this, Free U. has gotten into
the use of media. This week,
Free U. returns to the public
consciousness as it moves into its
new headquarters, in the old
bookstore opposite the Hatch.

Last year there was no real
grasp on the part of the student
body as to the nature of Free U.
The Dome City failed as a spark.
Apathy was the general reaction.
What could have been a new di-
mensinn in the college life of
Joe Umie became a story for the

for the dorm rat.

It shouldn’t be like that-. Edu-
cated people, especially those
who can read ought, I think, to
be curious. A recent survey
showed that eighty-six percent
of all UMass undergraduates
were in fact literate. This consti--
tutes a clear majority, yet only
sixteen per cent of the student
body is curious. That is, I think
curious.

Free U. is an opportunity for
those students who are dissatis-
fied -to find alternatives. It is
a largely structureless flexible
organization in a time where few
things are flexible. It’s a chance
to rap with people who are into
interesting things. It’s also en-
tirely -preferable to the ceiling
in your room which yiu just
maybe find yourself staring at,
no?

Find out about Free U. It’s
tight there by the Hatch.

No more than one member of
any department could serve
in this capacity simultaneously.”

If the trustees are to have final
say in the award of tenure, why
should the faculty not have the
right to demand that certain qual-
ifications be necessary for Board
membership?

A self perpetuating group of
financial wizards and business-
men are a questionable body to
hold such power. I believe that
the board has no value in this
judgement other than the rejec-
tion of a tenure proposal for
financial contingencies.

-Again I affirm that our systems
and our laws must be inherently
fair and valid. We cannot al-
ways depend on the judgment
of. those persons who administer
these systems and laws. All the
‘if clauses’ of our policies must
be rewritten to be clear and con-
cise. for we are governed by men
who can err, not gods.

“To my knowledge. it is the only one

a student’s grievanceswill be heard and
his rights protected. ‘

“There is a great need for something
like this,”A said BSC member Dr. Eleanor
Isard, the director of the Counceling Cen-
ter. “Hopefully, it will resolve some of
the disputes between students and advis-
ors that the Counceling Center is now
trying to settle.”

Dr. Isard said the Grievance Commit-

plaints by students who are prevented,
either by their advisor or their instructor.
from droppingcourses.

She also expressed the hope that it

The question of whether a student
must be mandated to take classes in for-
eign language has been blown up into a
controversy that has plagued both stu-
dents and faculty for more than a year. 

The issue arose last fall when an ad

l(ent State’s ‘Bust List’ Reaches 25

by SHARON SALYER
The Kent Stater

Busted: Bill Arthrell. a junior
education major. for second de-
gree riot: not a new story around
Kent in the days following the
Grand Jury probe. He's number
19 arrested out of 25 indicted.

This reporter met Arthrell in
the SAC office as he was leaving
campus to voluntarily surrender
to the Portage County Sheriff's of-
fice. “We've been made political
pawns and now we have to legally
fight it.“ is the way he summar-
ized his feelings toward the in-
dictments.

On the way to Ravenna. Arth-
rell said he felt the persons in-
dicted were "a very diverse group
of people.“ An “atmosphere of
fear“ prevails over Kent. he said.
because of the “spacing" between
indictments.

The Grand Jury report, he con-
tinued, “created bias” before the
trial. -

As Arthrell went behind a door
to officially turn himself in. Shell
Hull. a friend of Arthrell. asked.
“How can this happen to us? How
can a county or town judge stu-
dents when they don‘t under-
stand the university?"

Cathedral Basement

Set for Remodeling Job

The long neglected Cathedral basement is slated for a re-
modeling which promises to make use of formerly wasted space.

Vice Chancellor of Finance, Edison .\lontgomer_v announced
that "Central Printing and the University Mailroom will both be
moved to the high-ceilinged area adjacent to the Studio Theatre."

A double ceiling will be installed. providing two floors for

the area.

Directly above this area is the
Registrar's Office, which as a
result of the construction will
have a floor put in a formerly
inaccessible area.

The cost of the operation is
approximately 82.000 dollars. in-
clusive of air conditioning for the

basement project and the Regis-

Vice Chancellor Montgomery
mentioned that there was a "pos-
sibilit_v of a remote job entry
computer substation being install-
ed. so that students wishing to
use the computers would not have
to travel to the seventh floor of
the Cathedral."

The substation would be locat-
ed in the
shop, facing Bigelow Boulevard.

this university last May. And the
eyes of a whole nation watches so
closely over what happens in this
town. that seems to be over-
whelmed by its new-found no-
toriety.

The judge entered and a man
asked, “Are you the candidate?”
looking at Arthrell. After the
judge asked Arthrell about his
class schedule, he set Friday, 9
a.m., for arraignment and set
bond at $1,000.

Leaving the courtroom. a short.
smiling bail bondsman told us
that most court workers went
home at 4 p.m. and reminded us
that they had done Arthrell a fav-
or by rushing him through. The
bondsman said the “favor“ had
kept Arthrell from waiting in jail
until morning.

Arthrell returned to the base-
ment of the court building for
thumb prints and mug shots.

Returning to the car. bedecked
with a Kent State sticker below a
peace sign. he found a parking
ticket. which was paid in a nearby
fine box.

UM Disciplinary, Code

Provides Matched Counsel

UM students charged with
major disciplinary offenses will
have the right to counsel starting
this September.

The change comes as part of a
revised disciplinary procedure
that has been “approved in prin-
ciple" by the Board of Trustees
and the Faculty Senate.

Students. charged with minor
offences will continue to be tried
through the Men's Residence
Hall Association and the Associa-
ted Women Students, however.

An important feature of the new
procedure will be the provision
for matched counsel. This pro-
vides that if a student wishes to
