Snaps Mountaineers’ Streak  

By DONALAD GIFFIN

' « Sports

Editor

MORGANTOWN, W. Va.—Pitt’s intense ‘basketeers took West
Virginia’s 58—game home winning streak and jammed it down the
throats of some 7000 unbelieving Mountaineer fans here Saturday

night.

The Panthers choked off the jeers and catcalls directed at their

possession strategy by nosing out Lee Patton’s club, 34-32, in an over-

time tingler.

Stunned, the spectators ﬁled
from the WVU ﬁeld house after
witnessing the ‘Mountaineer’s
ﬁrst Morgantown defeat since
1944. Pitt did it that time, too.

_ Pitt Ran Show ,

Dr. H. C. Carlson’s blueprint
for the game was carried out to
near perfection by his ball-hand-
ling experts.

They ignored the hoots and pa-
per wads of the grandstanders and
forced the West Virginians to play
the game Pitt’s way. Although
trailing by a few points through
the ﬁrst three quarters, the Pan-
thers kept the ball from the fast-
breaking Mounties. .

For nearly seven minutes in the
second quarter they hoarded the
oval while behind, 13-11.

WVU Poor Freezers

When the‘ West Virginians, cap-
italizing on one or two of Pitt’s
infrequent mistakes, jockeyed
ahead, 26-18, they tried the Pan-
ther tactics. They backﬁred on
them, though. '

Three times the Caravan scored
by swiping the ball from the
Mountaineers, unaccustomed to
manipulating the freeze.

Dodo Canterna and Sammy Da-
vid completed their_Pitt' careers
insimilar fashion to other games
in which they wore the Panthers

Lou (Bimbo) Cecconi had brok-
en away for a layup a minute
earlier, but Eddie Sterling had
fractured the deadlock almost as
soon as it was forged. His rebound
tap-in at 7:15 jumped the losers
in front, 29-27.

Pitt followed its hold-the—ball
pattern in the "overtime period.
After Fred Schaus converted a
free throw, Dodo swished his ﬁfth
long set shot at 2:50. '

WVU’s Eddie" Beach flicked in
an easy peep with a minute left.

INTIMIDATINC VOTES

' \Ve11, the Great Beer Scare ended in Congress last Monday
-amid motions and countermotions and a rather preeinptory de-

cree from the undergraduate deans that they wouldnot consider
changing the University’s policy on drinking even if Student
Congress approved it. .

This last was the most unsavory part of a generally silly
aﬁair. There was plenty of time for the deans to state their
position after Congress acted. Certainly there was no necessity
for appearing at the Congress meeting with a ruling intended to
force‘ Congress’s vote into line with their ideas. - V _

VVe never did think much of the beer proposal -and we’re

'glad to see that it came to its proper end. But we think that

there is enough common sense in Congress to have defeated it
without ‘ﬁrst hearing an ultimatum from the deans. In short we
action lacked both good timing and

"Since Student Congress is supposed to represent.theistu-
dents (a view to which the deans theoretically subscribe) it is

' entitled to come to its decisions freely. It also has a right to

be heard by the deans after reaching these decisions, no matter

how much the proposals may conﬂict with current University.

policy. Unless Congress is given that consideration it has no.
reason for existence. _ V V »

, The whole episode is another illustration ofthe impotency
of Congress, and its dependence on administration support un-
der the present setup. The defeat of the beer question is of little
importance. But it is alarming to think. that another measure,
a reallygood one, could come to the same end’ in the same
manner-. ‘ '

Music Notes

By JERRY NEWBERG . T;

It looks like a sell-out for the Military Ball.
All the tickets alloted to the Student Desk
have been sold and the ticketchairnian is call-
ing in.all unsold tickets held by Military Ball
committee men. Ticket sales will be stopped
when expenses are met. Maestro Tex’ has
added to his group two new Vocalists, Glenn
Douglas and Mary lllayo, who will appear with
the band on March 18 . . . “America’s No. One
Saxophonist” Charlie Ventura featuring new
sounds in music will appear for a one-niter at
the “Hills” New Granada Theater on March
15 ‘from 9:30 p. in. to 1:30 a.~m. Tickets are
on sale at the New Granada or at Lomak»in’s.
Charlie placed first in the tenor sax division
of the Metronome poll and placed second to
Duke Ellington as the year’s outstanding’ so-
loist in t-he Down Beat poll. Sure to ina_ke the
hop fans go wild is the Ventura and crew
waxing tabbed “Pina Colada.” Roy Kral and
Jackie Cain feature their pipes and the combo
bop vocal by the pair is nothing short of ter-
riﬁc, as is the wonderful orchestrated patter
brought up by the Ventura -boys.‘ Ultra fast
tempo‘, and smart licks by the maestro all go
toward making this platter a winning one.
The ﬂip, “Stop ’n Go” acts as another show-
case for the great Ventura group . . . Lovely

THE SITUATION ‘becomes involved when Morell decides to leave Candida (portrayed
by Anatalie Gefsky) and Marchbanks alone in the house while he leaves’ to speak at a Socialist meet-

i The Pitt Players’ next production, “Candida,” will be presented
at Stephen Foster Memorial.

§ Anatilie Gefsky, who has appeared in the past Players’ produc-
bns of “The Philadelphia Story” and “Would—Be Gentleman,” has

le‘ title role of Candida.

 Miss Gefsky has done work with the Pittsburgh Playhouse,

gorking on such plays as “Hand in Glove.” She also ‘appeared in the

Jack Schano, recently appoint-

Mr. Schano will be remembered

Robert Sisler, an advanced

a role of Marchbanks, the

Ruth Schwartz, who has ap-
peared in Pitt Players’ “Would-Be

Phi Epsilon Pi and the Phys Ed
Whips meet Thursday at 5:30 p.m.
for the Pitt IM basketball cham-
pionship.

Both teams came through with
wins last Thursday at Trees gym
in semi-ﬁnal tilts.

The Whips were pressed hard

by a good Gopher ﬁve before‘

winning, 41-34. The Phi Eps had
a much easier time in blasting an
outclassed Pioneer quintet, 36-19.
Starting fast, the Whips built
up an 11-point lead early in the
second period, only to see the
Gophers rally and trail by only
two points, 22-20, at halftime.
Not more than three points
separated the two teams until the
four-minute mark was reached in

Rosa, Steve Pavlokovic, and Steve
Yewcic dumped in three quick
baskets and the Whips were off
to the races.

Bob Miller’s hook shots and
Curly Weitz’s set shoes for the
Phi Eps in the. other game were
too much for the Pioneers.

Held to an 8-5 lead at the quar-
ter, the IF champs opened up and
led, 18-10, at halftime.

In another game,’ Theta Chi
captured third place in. the IF
league by beating the PiKA’s,
56-40.

In the‘ championship tilt,. the
Phi Eps /will be out to add the
IM crown to their laurels. But

to win, they must beat a Whip

outﬁt that twice beat the Edu-
cators, conquerers of the Eps in
last year’s IF title game.
