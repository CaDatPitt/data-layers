Students scour city during PMADD

For The Pitt News ‘

Students left the comparatively
tidy area of Oakland Saturday
morning to head out into areas
littered with garbage, scrap
metal and stray tires buried in
knee-high grass. '

The University’s fourth an-
nual Pitt Make a Difference Day
sent several thousand students
to more than two dozen commu-
nities throughout Pittsburgh to
clean up litter, set up chemistry
kits for local schools and reno-
vate parks.

Students ﬁlled several dozen
buses that departed from Pitt at
8:30 a.m. They then scattered to
the North Side, South Side,lLaw-
renceville and several other areas
around the city. Organizers of the
event said that they would not
have the official count of the at-
tendees until at least Monday.

 

Student Government Board
member John Hasley said Pitt
students proved their dedication
to community involvement.

“This year was absolutely a
success, especially around now,
when people in the community
complained that students were a
nuisance. We were able to prove
students are responsible,” he
said."

Freshman Kyle VanDerPool
heard about the event through
the First Year Experience Face-
book page.

“I think it’s an important way
for studentsto give back to the
community,” VanDerPool said
on the bus ride to California-

~ Kirkbride, an area in the North

Side.As dozens of students ﬁled
out into the low—income neigh-
borhood, an atmosphere of ea-
gerness to get to work began to
pervade the group.

According to Debbie Reed, the

president of California-Kirkbride

‘ as curbs and the public park.

Neighbors, California-Kirkbride
is a neighborhood in dire need
of help. She said the area suffers
from neglect, litter and plant
overgrowth in public areas such

C1ean—up is the ﬁrststep tog-
ward renovation of the area’s
park, which was an important
part of the California-Kirkbride
community.

“Families used the park for
years, and it was an important
part of the community,” Reed
said. “It seems like forever since
it’s been used.”

A Senior Shelbie Devoe was
excited for the opportunity to
bond with new friends from the
Anthropology Club while raking
leaves and picking up litter.

From rolling old tires out of
knee-high grass to weeding brush
and removing rotting’ wood,
about 30 hands Volunteering at
the park were filled while per-
forming necessary tasks. A

Kathy Humphrey, Pitt’s vice

A provost and clean ‘of students,

regarded the enormous turnout
with little surprise. V

“The students coordinate this
and step forward every year,” she
said. “Student Affairs just sup-
ports their efforts.”

Kate Malekoff, SGB’s PMADD
chairwoman, said that, logisti-
cally, the annual event takes
roughly an entire year to coordi-

~ nate. Initial plans are developed

by SGB and PMADD, as well as
interested volunteers. This year,
30 students with no group afﬁli-
ation came forward to help plan
the event.

Every year, Student Volunteer
Outreach gets in contact with ne-

glected areas and finds sites at

which students can volunteer,
but individual organizations,
such as the Special Olympics at
the University of Pittsburgh, also
propose ideas for places to serve.

For The Pitt News?-

The fourth annual Sleep-In for
the Homeless took place Friday
at Schenley Plaza — except at-
tendees didn’t “sleep—in.”

Community Human Services
planned for the event to run from
6 p.m. until 6 a.m. But the organi-
zation received a phone call early
on Friday from city oflicials, who
informed the group that city or-
dinance does not permit sleeping
in a public park. Organizers then
decided to conclude the event,
which drew in about 200 people,
at 11 p.m. '

On the event website, CHS
Development Director Diane
McMah.on expressed her dis-
appointment. She said that on
Wednesday afternoon, the city
was questioning the location of
the event.

“This was a total surprise since
the mayor’s office and council
had offered proclamations for
the ‘Sleep—In for the Homeless,”
McMahon said on the organiza-
tion’s website.

Mayor Luke Ravenstahl issued
a proclamation declaring "Oct. 21
“Sleep—In For The Homeless Day”
to honor the dedication of Com-
munity Human Services.

“We are very frustrated that
this happened when we paid for
the event, alerted the city and
knew that other groups had slept
out at this same location,” Mc-

His car was one of a dozen that
lined up on Bigelow Boulevard
this weekend for the Panther Rac-
ing Club’s car show to raise money
for its sponsor, Feel Your Boobies.
Feel Your Boobies is a national
nonprofit organization whose
mission is to provide women with
knowledge and resources to help
them ﬁght breast cancer.

Panther Racing Club member
Tom DuPree suggested the idea of

. aligning the club with the charity
because of his mother’s work with
breast cancer. « .

Pitt alum Dr. Beth DuPree is a
comprehensive breast care sur-
geon for»Holy Redeemer Health
System in Southampton, Pa. She
wrote the book “The Healing
Consciousness: A Doctor’s Jour-
ney to Healing” and came out to
the event on Sunday to support
the cause.

Car show raises

Dr. DuPree challenged club
members to “raise money for
something bigger than [the
club].” She has promised tomatch
the team’s donations to Feel Your
Boobies with her own donation to
the organization. ,

A" major Steve Karkenny proposed

the idea for the car show, inspired
by the Pittsburgh Vintage Gran
Prix held annually in Schenély

Park. When he suggested using

the show to fundraise for Breast

beginning of October, the group
immediately began searching for
interested organizations.

off a 2012 Mini Co.op_er. to dis-
play, and Bill Airgood, a senior

CEO of Community Humanservices
Adrienne Walnoha said at the event that
she was also frustrated by the change.

“It wouldlhave been nice to know ahead
of time,” "Walnoha said. “But when life

' hands you lemons, you make lemonade.”

Walnoha acknowledged the irony of
the situation when she explained to the
crowd that the homeless encounter the
same predicament of where to sleep on a
daily basis. ,

Elizabeth Zinni, a senior at Slippery
Rock University, attended the event, but
was unhappy that she wouldn’t be able
to sleep outside and experience what the
homeless have to do every day.

“I’m disappointed that we won’t get the
full experience,” she said.. _

Despite the setback, the fundraising
event successfully continued throughout
the evening with guest MCs Mike Stout and
Sean McDowell. As part of the registration
for.the event, participants donated $25 to
Community Human Services. -

Attendees took a tour of the city to dis-
cuss problems such as where they would
sleep if they were homeless.

CHS organized the event to raise aware--
ness about the homeless.situation and to
fundraise for about‘1,500 of 2,500 local

ds light on homelessness in city

According to a survey done by the De-
partment of Human Services, Allegheny
County has nearly 2,500 homeless people,
rendering it difficult for the community to
avoid the problem. -

Co—chair Clark told the audience that
sometimes a simple hello can make a per-
son’s day.

For years, Clark and his family served.

Christmas dinner for the homeless in
Downtown Pittsburgh. They soon became
familiar with .a man named Harold. The
softspoken man dressed in army apparel
would always sit quietly at the dinner table
for a while before gathering up the courage
to ask for his dinner.

Clark eventually encouraged his teen-
age son Paul to make conversation with
Harold, and the two became friends.

Three years later, Paul returned from
college to help out with another Christmas
dinner. When he couldn’t ﬁnd Harold, he
asked his father for information about him.
Clark had to tell his son that Harold had
frozen to death earlier that week.

For Harold "as well as for the countless I

others who face winters without the guar-
antee of heat or shelter, Clark continues
supporting Community Human Servicles
year after year at the “Sleep~In;;Eo

Stajf Writer —

The Nominating Committee of Pitt’s Boardbf
Trustees has recommended two Pitt alumni
as Emeritus Trustees.

~—-- as ----
The Board

past contributions.
—Mark Nordenberg
Afteraconference call meetinghosted by

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg Friday morn-
ing, George Davidson Jr. and David Fawcett

V Jr. might be named Emeritus Trustees if the

board acts on the comrnittee’s recommenda-
tion at the full board meeting on Oct. 28.
Nordenberg introduced the two men at

the meeting and praised them for their con- ,

tributions to Pitt.

“During their decades of dedicated service
to the University, George Davidson and Da-
vid Fawcett have contributed signiﬁcantly to
Pitt’s progress in a range of ways, from their

membership on therBoard of Trustees and on _

the Board of Visitors, to their visible presence

as Pitt ambassadors in the community, to .

their generous philanthropy,” he said.

Davidson, who graduated from Pitt in 19 61
with a degree in engineering, is the retired
chair of Dominion Resources, an energy
provider. _

He has served as a Board of Trustees mem-
ber since 1987 and is currently vicechair of
the Swanson School of Engineering Bo_ard

V of Visitors.

The American Gas Association awarded
Davidson with the Distinguished Service
Award in 2003 for natural gas industrial
contributions, and Pitt’s Board of Trustees
recently awarded him with the Trustee Me-
dallion, acknowledging his services to the
University. 1

David B. Fawcettjr. graduated from Pitt’s
School of Law in 1953. He now works as a se-
nior partner in his law ﬁrm Dickie, McCamey
& Chilcote and is a member on the School of
Law Board of Members. From 1987 to 2005
he served as an Alumni Trustee.

In 1991, the School of Law recognized
Fawcett as a DistinguishediAlumni, a des-
ignationlwhich acknowledges his career ac-

complishments and his contribution to the

ﬁeld of law.

Both Davidson and Fawcett have been the
University director for UPMC in the past. y

“Through George and Dave's election as
Emeritus Trustees, the Board respectfully
acknowledges their past contributions and
ensures the University will continue to ben-
eﬁt from their service and wise counsel,”

Budget confusion

merits attention

Most Pitt professors would agree
that the more information a study
provides, the more‘ trustworthy
it becomes. But when it comes to
ﬁnances, the University seems
determined to keep both its stu-
dents and its employees in the
dark.

spokesman Robert Hill, Pitt in-
stated a 2 percent budget cut —
$40 million dollars in total ——
across all 600 of its units, which

include both academic and ad-'
. ministrative departments. When

this cut will actually take effect,
however, and how individual de-
partments plan to cope with it,
has yet to be revealed.

More troubling still, the Uni-
versity seems to have neglected
informing certain administrators
of the measure. In an article last
Friday, chairs of the English,
communications and chemistry
departments told The Pitt News
that they hadn’t heard of the cut,
or that it hadn’t affected their
budgets. ’

Clearly, transparency is not
one of Pitt’s priorities. But for a
University responsible not only

for student money but also more

than $100 million in state funds,
such secrecy is particularly unjus-
tifiable (not to mention inconsis-
tent with the University motto,
“Veritas et Virtus,” or “Truth and
Virtue”). Students struggling to

. cope with an 8.5 percent tuition

hike and a2 percent budget cut
have a right to know, forinstance,
how many employees Pitt has cut
this year. Thus far, administra-
tors have only provided us with
general overviews of their ‘cost-
saving measures, and no ‘num-

'lhink we

According to University

bers.

Part of the problem is that Pitt,
a state-related school, is not held
to the same high accountability
standards as Pennsylvania’s 14
public universities, and is thus

permitted to reveal remarkably .

little information about its fi-
nances (what it does disclose
can- be found in the annually
published Fact Book). How much
support an individual department
receives per year, or the salary of
any single professor, is not made
available to the public.

The University’s recent be-
havior also raises organization-
al concerns. We can understand
why Pitt wouldn’t want the media
scrutinizing the particulars of its
2 percent cut, but its failure to
inform some of its own depart-
ments of the measure is not only
indefensible, it’s inexplicable. If
chairs were to remain unaware of
the cut during the year in which
it was implemented, they would
eventually discover they were 2
percent over budget, and the re-

mainder of their spending plans ‘
' would be thrown out of whack.

When a scientist publishes a
study in a journal, he reveals the
sources of his data and the means
by which he came to certain con-
clusions; in short, he exposes
himself to criticism. Pitt officials,
who are more familiar with these

I conventions than nearly anyone

else in our community, under-
stand this. It’s curious, then, that
they seem so averse to revealing
information. just as scholarship
can’t ﬂourishwithout external
criticism, Pitt endangers its in-
tegrity by keeping its ﬁnances
to itself. I ‘

. Columnist

 

Capitalism has long been viewed as
more than just an economic system,
and until some yet-to-be determined
date, we’re going to be hearing loud
denunciations of it from the people
occupying Pittsburgh.

Yet those who denounce capital-
ism seldom know what it is, or that
what they’re protesting isn’t really
capitalism and why the alternate sys-
tems they sometimes propose are not
any better. It’s time to set the record
straight on all three fronts.

What is capitalism? Essentially,
it’s a system_ wherein resources are
allocated based on marketsthat are
relatively free and unfettered. The

govemment remains impartial,_and '

constricts itself to maintaining law
and order, enforcing contracts and
property rights, providing infra-
structure and dealingwith situations
where the beneﬁts or costs of doing
a certain  don’t entirely fall to
the person or ﬁrm doing it. That’s
about it. '_ -

Thevprotestors point to the im-
plosion of the housing market, par-
ticularly credit—default swaps and
the housing bubble, as a product

of this system. Was it? Yes and no.
Credit default swaps would have been
invented in an unbridled capitalis-
tic system, but if these bets turned
sour and the banks failed as a result,
it would have been entirely on the
heads of the banks. By bailingout the
banks, the government has implied
that misjudging risk is not punished,
and it is by government action, not
by the action of the markets, that the
banks are encouraged to behave in a
risky fashion. ‘ .
The protesters also decry income
inequality. This is partly the result of
skill and education inequalities, and
it provides an incentive for people to

e do certain jobs that would otherwise

be unattractive. If awaiter and adoc-
tor were paid the same, what incen-
tive would anybody have to take on
$100,000 in debt and spend eight
years in school to become a doc-
tor? Although people are irritated
that CEOs make obscene amounts
of money, they’re paid well because
they’re uniquely talented at running a
company. And if they aren’t talented,
they get ﬁred. I

I would also ask the Occupy pro- V

testers what system they would pro-
pose to replace “capitalism” as it is
practiced today. Many would suggest
some brand of socialism, anarchy or

Mike Rosenthal I Staff Illustrator

communism. The problem with all
three of these systems is that they
depend on miracles. _

Communism requires that the
state have power sufficient to disman-
tle the bourgeoisie and grantworkers
control of the means of production.
The problemiswhat comes next. Karl
Marx and Friedrich Engels believed
that after the worker’s paradise was
achieved, the state would wither away.
The problem is, when the people run-
ning the state are granted that much
power, why would they voluntarily
cede it? They didn’t do so inthe USSR,
Cuba, North Korea, China or _Cam-
bodia, and they’ve failed to in many
other places as well.

Anarchism swings to the other
extreme, maintaining that once the
state is gone, people will organize
themselves in small collectives, make
collective decisions and all will be
well. The problem is thatthis requires
cooperation between people, a lack
of ambition to be the one in charge
and mutual trust and respect. Not
many people are that cooperative,
selﬂess and trusting. A lot of people
advocating anarchism aren’t even
that cooperative: They would prob-
ably be unwilling to work with the
very “fat cats” they now decry. Inad-

Capitalism facilitates sound decision-making

Kozlowski < 5

vertent experiments in anarchy and
forced independent decision-making
by small collectives, such as the types
which took place in Somalia, Afghani-
stan, Congo and even New Orleans
after Hurricane Katrina, have not
demonstrated promising results.
Socialism seems the most ap-
pealing of the alternatives. Social
Democrat governments have shaped
European politics for generations. But
the results there aren’t better than
the results here. Greece is facing a
complete ﬁnancial meltdown that will

lead to painful changes in the welfare _

state, one way or another. In Italy,
welfare exacerbates anti-irnmigrant
sentiment. The slums of France have
been racked with race riots in the re-
cent past as bad as anything we’ve
seen here, and unemployment of
pooryouth is atrociously high. Great
Britain, despite having state-provided
health care, a generous social safety
net and higher taxes than we do, still
had massive riots this summer.
Capitalism, by contrast, is a good
economic systemfor several reasons.

Capitalism is democratic. When peo-
ple speak of “the market,” they aren’t
talking about a cabal of white men
in fancy suits. The market is you, me
and roughly 7 billion of our closest
friends making decisions about what
to buy. Decentralizing decision-mak-
ing ensures its efficiency. In order to
decide how many pairs of every kind
of size 11 shoe need to go in every
store in the country, a bureaucrat in
Washington would have to have an
incredible amount of information
atihis disposal. It ismuch easier to

stock shoes correctlyinafree-market
system. The owner of every store has
a good idea of what kinds of shoes

- are selling and orders more of those

kinds. He has every incentive to get
the number right: Order too many
and he endsup with a huge surplus he

can’t sell; order too few and custom-

ers get upset. .

Another advantage of capitalism
is that it encourages innovation and
thedevelopment of new products and
ideas. Apple created the iPhone be-
cause it thought it could make money

selling it, not because the government
ordered its development or Stevejobs
was feeling benevolent.

Capitalism has received an unfair
hearing because few people under-
stand it. It has also gotten an unfair
hearing because a lot of what is sup-
posedly an example of “unfettered

capitalism” is in fact repulsive to the .

unfettered capitalist. We need to rec-
ognize thatfor all its faults, capitalism
is still a better system than the most
prominent alternatives.

for celebration. Collecting
revenue from the gas industry and
giving it to affected communities
is more than I had ever expected
to see from him, but it is far from
the best course of action.

Stamatakis was right about one

thing: Corbett’s plan was genius. _

He’s appeasing the industry by
letting them take Pennsylvania
by storm, as long as they toss
some cash our way first. And he’s
appeasing citizens by leading
them to believe that money can
magically dispel the negative
effects of drilling. The idea that

-it’s okay to pollute as long as you

pay an adequate monetary sum
permeates our society, but it’s
completely arbitrary; there’s no
exchange

rate in nature between pollution
and pennies.

Corbett’s plan is nothing more
than paying communities off to
put their health at risk. That
risk is not worth.it, especially
for what is only a temporary
solution to the energy crisis.
When all the wells have been
fracked, and whether or not rates
of illnesses, cancer and birth
defects have risen in the process,
we’ll find that our nation’s
appetite for energy has still not
been permanently satiated. A
true cause for celebration would
be to start pursuing sustainable,
renewable, permanent energy
sources now, not putting our
health and our ecosystem’s health
at risk for nothing but a quick fix
with negative side effects.

Sincerely,

Ashton Gibbs has picked upright
where he left off.

Gibbs — a senior guard for

and the Big East Preseason Player

. of the Year —- had 26 points and

led the Blue team to a‘ 5-7-49 vic-
tory over Gold in the annual Blue-

The game pits the two halves of

Gibbs went 7-13 from the field,

from the free—throw line. He also

finished with four assists.

“I probably should have

guard Travon‘ Woodall said with a
smile. “It’s hard to disrupt some-
body like that.”

Woodall, who covered Gibbs
for portions of the game, is con-

vinced his teammate has im- e

proved since his stellar junior
season. ‘ =  A

“I don’t know if you noticed
his burst of‘-speed out of the
dribble,’ but his first step got so
much faster,” Woodall added.
“His whole body._changed.”

The game started off sloppy,

with a turnover, goaltending call, '

missed shot, foul and travel all
in the first four possessions, but
after scoring a total of only eight

points at the 11:55 mark in the

MEN’S SOCCER

Greg Trietley
Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s soccer team saw its chances
of making the Big East Championship dwin-
dle this week, as the Panthers concluded
their home schedule with losses Tuesday
and Saturday to teams they chased in the
standings.

The Panthers entered the week one point
behind both the Providence Friars and N otre
Dame’s Fighting Irish for the last spot in the
postseason tournament, but they lost to the
Friars on Tuesday, 1-0, and to the Fighting
Irish on senior night Saturday, 3-1.

The consecutive losses put Pitt (4-11-1,
2-5-0 Big East) four points behind the sixth-
place Fighting Irish with two games left in
the regular season.

“It’s the same script,” Pitt men’s soccer
head coach Joe Luxbacher said about the
loss to Notre Dame. “We didn’t play well
in the ﬁrst 15 minutes. We’re trying to ﬁg-
ure out how to score a goal. We had a few
chances, but we’re still not creating enough
chances.”

It’s still possible for the Panthers to make
the Big East tournament, but they would
‘need to win their ﬁnal two games and Notre

Dame would have to lose a match and tie a
match.

Notre Dame (7-3-4, 3-2-1 Big East) took it
to the Panthers on senior night, out-shooting
them 24-7 and out-cornering them 10-3.

“They were just a step faster than us,”
Luxbacher said after the game. “Our guys
battled and hung in there, but they [the
Fighting Irish] deserved to win. They were
the better team tonight.”_ .

Pitt had a great opportunity to open the

place in the Big East. The top six teams from each division advance to the Big East tournament.

none came from officials.

“We had a couple chances early,” Lux-
bacher said. “I thought we should have had
a penalty kick quite honestly when Prete
was pulled down in the box.”

From there, the game was all Notre Dame,
as the Fighting Irish opened the scoring on
a wild play in the 33rd minute. Sophomore

thers were up in arms wanting a call, but

first couple up and downs, when the lights
are bright, you get the jitters.”

Moore ﬁnished 6-15 from the ﬁeld and
added seven rebounds and an assist to
his stat line.

“Points are good, but it’s a team sport,”
Moore said. “I just wanted to contribute

to getting the win, but unfortunately we

didn’t come out with it.”

Khem Birch also drew some attention.
The McDonald’s A1l—American, playing for
the first time on his new Pitt homecourt,
drew some early cheers for his ability in
the air.‘

The freshman forward recorded eight
points, four rebounds and three blocks
— not including two that were waved for
goaltending.

“I want to get the highlights —- block-
ing shots and getting dunks,?’ Birch said.
“But I also want to win too; don’t get me
wrong.”

Birch, who had an explosive put-back
dunk for the Gold team’s first points of
the second half, drew additional atten-
tion to the blond streak running through
his hair. I - -

“I just like being different,” Birch said.
“I was going to wear ﬂuorescent green
shoes. Hopefully Coach [Jamie] Dixon
will let me.”

The freshman also had three turnovers,
and he admitted he felt some of those jit-
ters his teammates had alluded to.

“You know, I really did,” Birch said.
“Coaches really look at this stuff to see if
you’re ready.” V

The crowd was loudest when guard

son —— hit back-to—back 3-pointers with

less than two minutes left in the game to
seal the victory for the Blue squad.

Rivers finished with six points, an assist
and a steal in 13 minutes of play time.

While Moore admitted the game was
“mostly fun and games,” head coach Dixon
understands that this time is valuable.

“It’s practice number seven. It’s six
freshmen. It’s a team finding their way,”
Dixon said.

Noticeably absent from the game was
senior forward Nasir Robinson, who had
knee surgery on Friday and is expected to“
miss three to four weeks.

The team expects him to make a full re-
covery and return in time for Pitt’s season

The Heart Health Fair and Fan Fest were
held at 2:30 p.m., with the basketball team

. signing autographs from 3 to 4 p.m. More

than 6,000 people attended at least a por-
tion of the day’s events, including the scrim-
mage. . '

Alonglthe lower concourse, four tables of

' blood pressure screenings opposed two tables

of CPR and AED demonstrations. There was
also an “Ask the Dietician” booth where a
dietician discussed symptoms, factors and
ways to prevent sudden cardiac arrest.

The dietician proclaimed the four easiest ways
to stay healthy were to “exercise, eat healthy,

drink water and see your doctor regularly.”

The fair also provided health information
for fans. ‘ %

Cardiac Science, a medical device com-
pany, promoted its patented Rescue Ready
technology and Powerheart AEDs. Cardiac
Science’s website said that Rescue Ready “self-
tests the battery, deﬁbrillation pads and in-
ternal electronics [off the device] daily.”

The UPMC Heart and Vascular Institute
handed out book lights, pens, lip balm and
brochures, including pamphlets on helping
people to quit smoking.

The foundation also provided information
on the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Association

(SCAA) of Western Pennsylvania and jarksi ‘
A reiterated that awareness —— especially in the

young — was the key of the operation.

Young people were well—represented at
the event. Many children darted around the
Petersen Events Center lobby. V _

With activities ranging from the large in-
ﬂatable skee-ball set to the free face painting
and the moon bounce arena, Fan Fest kept
the children entertained.

The Pitt players and coaches were on
hand at Fan Fest for a meet—and-greet with
fans. The players were stationed at different
points throughout the Petersen Events Center

_ to talk to fans, take pictures and autograph

Pitt gear. V , .

Children, current Pitt students and Uni-
versity alumni lined up to take a picture

Colin Clark, a freshman at Pitt, said it
was exciting to meet the Pitt players and to
start looking forward to basketball season in
“the midst of the current lackluster football

. season.”

Freshman Nick Ratsep agreed.
