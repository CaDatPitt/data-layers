WPGH Elects Station General Manager  

By TOM KUKUCKA‘ ‘
Pitt News Staff Writer

Program Director Dan Shalenko
was elected general manager of
WPGH radio at a\ staff meeting
Monday night. Elected by accla-
mation, he will succeed Jeff Couch
Feb. 12.

Shalenko, a junior economics
major from Lower Burrell, was
program director at WARC-FM

(Allegheny College) before joining ~

WPGH in "a similar position last
spring.

Active in attempting to gain an
FM frequency for the student-run

station, Shalenko said he believed I

the University administration was
close to committing itself to such a
project.

“We might have a breakthrough
next week,” Shalenko said. “We
think the time is right._ The

administration" might look-- more

favorable at the FM proposal than
in the past.” a

He said the naming the Larry
Lunsford as full-time media advisor
has aided the frequency search.

“He (Lunsford) has ﬁnally got
the ball rolling in the right
direction,” Shalenko said.

The groundwork for the search,
started last spring, has been
conducted by Education FM
Associates of Boston, which is
exploring the engineering and legal

aspects of the switch from carrier .

current (WPGH broadcasts‘ by
electrical current and reaches only
the dorms) to the FM band.
Shalenko said the search could
take up to two years, and would
prefer that the station remain
carrier current in thewinterim
period. WPGH would need a large

increase »in.; funding during this
period, according to Shalenko. «
WPGH last fall received $5,400
in emergency funds from Student
Government Board to repair
defects in the carrier current.
Shalenko said the repairs are still

being implemented, but indicated
that the $5,400 did’ not even cover
ﬁxed costs. ~

“We can’t constantly run on a
shoestring and expect to run a
Iﬁrst-class operation,” Shalenko
said. “And we can’t be shut down
and hope to have a staffito run the
new FM station.”

Shalenko said he believed the
station had made progress in
(programming the past year,

despite engineering problems and

lack of funds.

- “We’ve made as much progress
as we could given the situation we
are in,” Shalenko, said.

“We are constantly struggling to
stay alive,” Shalenko said. “There
is no telling what we can do with
this place.

“The attitude and talent is here.
All we need now is support.”

Lobby Committee Outlines Home Use

By MIKE KANE
Pitt News Staff Writer

Martin Bertocchi, Pitt student
lobbying coordinator, outlined
group plans yesterday for a home
lobbying campaign in an effort to
make local state legislators more
aware of the concerns of Pitt’s
students.

“We ﬁgure we have to inﬂuence
them (the legislators),” said
Bertocchi. “We’ve got to get them
working for us instead of just
ourselves doing the work.”

Bertocchi said that by Jan. 31 the
lobby group hopes to see some 40
legislators from the Greater Pitts-
burgh area . Ideally, Bertocchi said
he would like to have one lobbyist
visit two lawmakers now while they
are at their home ofﬁces, then have
the same lobbyist visit the same
lawmakers in Harrisburg. Right
now the group has 16 people
involved in lobbying.

Bertocchi listed the concerns the
group feels are most relevant to the
needs of Pitt students, and which it

plans to push for in the next few
months: increased appropriations,
preferred status for state-related
universities, merit scholarships to
replace the senatorial scholar-

makes up the second largest voting
bloc in the state. We also ﬁgure
the majority of Pitt’s students are
part of their voting constituents,
and from our experience, the
legislators are more responsive to
their own constituents.”

Because there are many newly-
elected officials assuming office
this month, Bertocchi feels the

Employment
Outlook
Improving

By LEONARD ROMBERG

Pitt News Staff Writer ~
Pitt seniors, especially engineers
and science majors, will face. an
improved employment situation

this year, according to Dan Nagy,

Pitt’s placement service director.
Representatives from several

Pittsburgh-based corporations that 1

recruit at Pitt said this year’s
employment plans have been
made and will not change even if a

recession occurs before this. sum-

mer.

“For graduates with technical
backrounds, this is the best year of
the last 15,” Nagy said. Compared
to last iyear, employment for

technical and science majors has 

increased 35 percent while employ-
ment for nontechnical jobs is up
ﬁve percent, Nagy said.

He estimated that 99 percent of
Pitt’s engineers could be placed at

a starting mean salary of $'17,4O0pa '

year. About 80 percent of Pitt’s
economics majors will ﬁnd jobs at
an average salary of $13,200 a year.
Graduates in the health profes-
sions will have between 90 and 100
percent placement. .
However, Nagy said that statis-
tics for economics and other social

sciences and humanities majors ‘are’ 

not as accurate because many
students go to graduate school. He
also‘ stated that many economics
students that get placed will
consider themselves underem-
ployed and will look for better jobs.
‘ Overall, the employment picture

is better than previous years, Nagy 7

claims. He said’ 580 company

representatives will visit Pitt this M

year, compared to only 265 three
years ago. ~
“The only things that could hurt
all college graduates is if the
inﬂationary spiral continues or if

the oil price situation worsens,”

Nagy said.
Traditionally large recruiters at

Pitt include Westinghouse, (the

largest employer of Pitt graduates),
IBM, PPG I.ndustries, U.S. Steel,
ALCOA, Mellon Bank, General
Electric and the Bell System.
“Our employment is up consi-
derably for next year,” said Craig
Fabian, manager of graduate
relations at Westinghouse.’ “Based
on our business, the outlook for
technical engineering and account-

ing is very bright—much better

than last year.”

PPG Industries, another local
corporation, also reported an
improved employment situation.

“The economic forecast we read
through June is positive,” Said
Joseph Schewe, manager of pro-
fessional employment "at PPG.

It was a marathon pig-out, to be

sure, yesterday as representatives-

from each of Pitt's 36 sororities and
‘fraternities gorged on salad,
setting a new world record to kick
off * a fund raising drive for the
American Cancer Society.

Over 300 students, most of them
Greeks, jammed into the Student
Union’s Lower Lounge at noon to
watch the contestants (lown 280
bowls of salad during the half hour
contest sponsored by the Interfra-
temity Council and the Panhellenic

' Association.

The salad—100 pounds of
shredded lettuce, carrots and red

’ cabbage—-and several gallon con-

tainers of various salad dressings
were donated by Red Bull Inn. The
total of $108 donated to the Cancer
Society was raised by each
organization, which‘ donated» SO

I cents per each bowl of salad

consumed by their entry.
The proceeds will support a

_ Cancer Society ﬁlm on breast

cancer to be distributed nationally.

Everyone was in on the
act—-from the actual contestants to
their cheering sections to those
designated to run back to the salad
table for reﬁlls.

“We just throw the lettuce into
the bowls whenever they bring the
bowls over,” said Laura Housley of
Delta Delta Delta.

Housley and Anne Kairys
manned the salad making station
and lost count of how many salads
they had dished out midway
through the contest. The contest-
ants themselves slopped on the
dressing. A

For the fraternities, Mike Puch-
irelli of Delta Tau Delta and Bruce
Gerson of Pi Lambda Phi took top

-honors, each consuming A23 bowls

of salad. Jerry Zell, representing
Zeta Beta Tau, took third place for
20 helpings.

Co-munch—‘out king , Puchirelli,
who hadn’t eaten since the night
before, said he was “a ‘little full.”

On the distaff side, Brigitte
Mularkey of Delta Zeta didn’t quite
rival Puchirelli and Gerson or even
Zell with her total of 16 salads, but
she was the top eater in the

sororities’ race. Theresa Lanowitz

of Alpha Delta Pi ﬁnished second,
and there was a tie at third place
between Kathy Bachner (Kappa
Delta) and Debbie York (Chi
Omega).

V Sybert-Makes Comeback  Hoo key‘ Mascot

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Entertainment Editor

Both teams are lined up on
center ice for the face-off, intent on
the game. But gliding along the
sidelines is the Pitt Hockey Club’s
special added attraction—the
Hockey Panther.

“People are really amazed to see
a panther on the ice. Some have
seen the Pitt Panther mascot on
television during football games,
but a hockey panther is something
different," said Steve Sybert, the
man behind the mask and tail.

Not only is the concept of a
hockey mascot something differ-

ent, but Sybert himself is a bit

unusual. A 1977 Pitt graduate,
Sybert was the Hockey Panther
through three years of college.
Upon graduation, Sybert moved to
Martins Ferry, Ohio, where he was
the assistant sports editor of the
Times Leader, and it looked as if
the tradition was ended.

However, last summer, Sybert
returned to his native Butler, Pa. to
serve a similar capacity on The
Butler Eagle, and told hockey club
coach Bob Montgomery he'd be
back on the ice when the season
started.

“I don’t know why I'm doing it,
to tell the truth,” Sybert said. “I
just like to be part of the sport.
Hockey and I go back 11 years.

“I started playing the sport out
on ponds. Then, we had a hockey
club at Butler High. When I came
to Pitt in 1973, I heard about the
hockey club and went to a couple
practices. But Irealized these guys
were super hockey players.”

Sybert’s initial role with the team
was not as a player but as a
reporter—he covered the games for
the Pitt News sports pages. Then
he came up with the idea of being
the mascot.

“I spent three years skating
around as the panther and taking
notes on the game at the same
time,” he recalled.

Sybert was inspired mostly by
the club’s late coach, Len Barca-
low, who succumbed to cancer last

spring.

‘‘I think about how-hard Lenny
used to work. That was his dream,
to get a hockey team at Pitt. His
dream was never fulfilled. Monty
(Montgomery) and I agreed the
reason we're doing this is Lenny,”

engineers, chemists and computer
science majors, but would also seek
accounting students if Pitt gets an
pndergraduate business school.

Not all ‘employers, though,
reported an improved condition.
Rodney Butler, employment man-
ager at Gulf Oil, said hiring in 1979
will be less than in 1978 because
profits decreased.

“Our goals for hiring are
projected a year in advance. We
know then how many persons "to
hire throughout the corporation,”
said Butler.

A representative for Pittsburgh
National Bank, a company hiring
accounting, economics and finance
students, said employment for
their management training pro-
gram decreased this year because
of a forecasted slowdown in
growth.

While the majority of the
Pittsburgh-based corporations will
place most of their new employees
in the Pittsburgh area, both Nagy
and the company representatives
suggested student ﬂexibility in
location.

“If you are willing to relocate

within just two hours of Pittsburgh
you open up a much greater job
market,” said Nagy, “There are a
lot more opportunities.” V
“We suggest students be flex-
ible.” said Fabian about Westing-
house. “Most employees have not

I stayed in Pittsburgh, but have been

placed throughout the nation." He
added that persons wanting to
advance their careers may have to
move out of Pittsburgh.

Most companies will recruit
persons from schools predomi-
nantly near their headquarters
because the cost of reaching
students and transferring them to
their jobs is less, explained Butler.

Pitt students have an advantage
of being in a city with many large
corporations, added Nagy.

Sybert’s contributions to the_
team are well recognized by
Montgomery, who donned the
Panther costume for a few games
during Sybert’s absence.

“Steve gets on their case,” he
said of Sybert’s analysis of the
team’s performance, “but he's
always fair about it.”

“He’s really a part of the team,”
Montgomery continued. -“He's
made the trip to Annapolis with us
every year—even when he worked
in Martins Ferry. I dread the year
he won’t be able to make it."

Skates Roll, Injuries Come

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Entertainment Editor

Kate Jackson does it. So does
Tatum O’Neal. Linda Ronstadt did
it on her latest album cover and at a
swanky Los Angeles restaurant
with Gov. Jerry Brown, Cher did it
for People magazine.

Did what? Rollerskating.

The natural successor to last
year's skateboard fad, rollerskating
was resurrected from the ﬁfties
recently. But, along with that

effortless glide comes the inevit-
able injuries that result from
inexperience with the sport.

To guard against injury during
trips to the skating rink, beginning
skaters should take special precau-
tions. It’s best to learn at a time
when the rink is fairly deserted.

The fit of the skate is another key
issue. The best type of roller skate
is the shoe type that laces midway
up the leg. This provides proper
support on fragile parts of the foot.

The skate should fit like a shoe.
Skates that strap onto the shoe
are generally fragile and do not

provide proper support.
Toe stops should be checked ,_

regularly for wear—a worn stop is a
prime cause for injury.

Female novices to the sport
should steer clear of the skating
outﬁt featuring shorts or high
hemlines. Contact with the ﬂoor is
inevitable and, ﬂoor burn and
bruises is the price.

By JIM LEWIS
Pitt News Staff Writer
Forgive Nancy Wintner for
bragging, but the hostess-producer
of Pitt’s ‘-‘Campus Connections”
show on KDKA-TV has had it a
little rough.
“It’s one thing to be a host, but

it’s doubly hard to be a producer

and a host,” she said. “Producing

itself is so complicated—so many -

things go on in the studio.”
Wintner, a senior communica-
tions major at Pitt, got the job when
KDKA decided that more students
of the 20 participating colleges
should be involved in the station’s
half-hour community service she I.
“I had no training——they (Pitt’s
News and Publications Office) just
dropped it into my lap anditold me
‘do it.”’
1And so Wintner, an intern at the
University’s public relations office,

I took the chance.

‘ ‘I knew it was my only chance ‘to
learn,” she said. “Although . I
didn’t know a thing about

medium and that organization had
to go down to minutes and
seconds.” .
What Wintner created was a
multi-guest variety show about
interesting people and events of
the University, different than the
other 19 schools’ interviews with
one professor. Pitt’s next pro-
gram—Thursday morning at 6

rev
0}‘
a.m.—features the Auto Racing
Team, the Glee Club, self-
protection, and unique physical

education classes offered by the
University.

“The show is not just of interest
to people at Pitt,” Wintner said,
“but one that others would enjoy as
well.”

On television, the show may
seem to go smoothly, but there are
a lot of problems before the final
product is shown.

“Because it’s a low-budget
show, KDKA doesn’t like to spend
too much time on it,” Wintner
explained. “So the show is filmed
as if it were live. And I have to
write a script, write an outline,

ts as TV Producer

design seating arrangements, pre-
interview the guests—I did that
during finals week.”

Allin all, the show takes about
one-and-a-half hours to film and
countless hours to plan. But the
station considers it worth it;
KDKA predicts that about 40,000
Pittsburghers view the morning
show.

Pitt-Oakland YMCA Reaches Out

on the ﬁfth ﬂoor of the Student

Union, does not have a swimming .

_somewhat shabby office offers a

diversity of unique experiences to
Pitt students who want‘ to get
involved with the Oakland com-
munity.. A T

The Pitt-Oakland YMCA has a

“reach out” philosophy. Because

of the Y’s unique campus situation,
it serves both the students and the
community. Executive director
Tom Huff feels the Y has an
obligation to provide pre-profes-
sional experience to the campus
community, which in turn benefits
Oakland and fosters a relationship
between the two. This relationship
is built through the aid of 22
current programs.

Pitt student Jayna Coury is
interested in Corrections, one of

the five areas of programs which
the Y has to offer. The corrections
program involves juveniles who
have dealt with the courts and are

a now in detention or group homes.

Part of the corrections program is

at the Shuman Detention Center.

Schulman Discusses Recent Chi

By SHARON CHERNICK

“The ﬁrst week we were there,
especially, was such an extraordin-
ary series of experiences that it was
hard to sleep. The most‘
remarkable thing about it was not
just the range but the intensity of
experiences and contact we had,”
said CAS Dean Irwin Schulman, as
he described the recent three-week
tour he conducted in the People’s«
Republic of China.

The tour itinerary, which includ-
ed stops in Canton, Shanghai,
Tai-an, Tientsin, and Peking was
planned by Schulman, who was

chosen by Associate Provost David

Powers to lead the group.

Schulman is familiar with China.
In addition to being dean of CAS,
he teaches political science courses
on China, and speaks Chinese
ﬂuently. He also spent a year in
Taiwan as a Fulbright scholar.

Schulman said that the group,
two-thirds of which spoke Chinese,
included people from different
ﬁelds of interest such as music, art,
engineering, political science,
medicine, and history. 1

Fourteen Pitt faculty members
and students and two Carnegie-
Mellon faculty members went on
the workistudy tour which began
Dec. 15 and concluded on Jan. 8.

Acting as spokesman for the
group, Schulman stressed that this
group was different from an
ordinary tourist group. One of the
main purposes of the tour was to
visit the schools and areas where

‘ Pitt faculty -will be teaching this.__,_

year and to deal with problems that
might occur before they got there.

Specifically, the group wanted to
obtain information about the kind
of facilities the universities have,
what courses Pitt faculty would be
teaching, what books they would

need, and what housing arrange-
ments are being made. '
“We found in most cases that

the universities were actively.

planning receptions for our faculty
members and actually building
houses for them to live in. They
were prepared to be extremely
co-operative and ﬂexible in work-
ing arrangements,” said Schul-
man.

According to Schulman, pro-
visions for faculty salary are still

being worked out. »

“I think that they will be paid a

salary by the Chinese and the cost -

of transporting them and their
dependents will be taken care of by
the Chinese. People who will be on
sabbaticals during their teaching
assignment will also get sabbatical
pay,” he said.

He added that there will be an
attempts made to obtain outside
ﬁnancing, possibly from the United
States government, in order to
provide a supplementary income
for people not on sabbatical.

One successful aspect of the trip,
according to Schulman, was the
lack of censorship and the frank
and open nature of the communica-
tion between the Americans and
the Chinese.

“We are used to reading about
how formal and circumscribed
contacts between the Americans

’ and Chinese are. ‘This turned ‘out

to be quite _different——more human
and intense. The Chinese
government seems to be engaging
in a carefully controlled experiment
in intellectual freedom and ex-
pressions of views,” he stated.
Schulman cited,-"wall poster
campaigns demanding democracy
and mock demonstrations for
freedom that have been taking
place in China recently. He said
that even though this is‘ being

closely watched by the Communist
Party, “for the moment they're
encouraging a degree of openness
and freedom in the exchange of
thoughts and ideas.”

Schulman said he doesn’t believe
that the people he talked to, which
included mainly university people,
were screened beforehand or that
the talks were pre-arranged or
theatrical in nature.

He said this new openness is the
result of the Chinese’ attempt to
modernize their industry as rapidly
as possible. The Chinese have
increased their ‘contact with the
West and have begun importing
western science technology and
management techniques.

“They seem to have come to the
conclusion that a prerequisite for
this rapid industrial modernization
is a certain degree of intellectual
freedom to avoid authoritarian

- control that may stifle the impulse

to modern development,” he said.
Schulman reported that he was
often questioned about how Amer-
ican universities are run, and was
in turn given information about
Chinese universities. He explained
that rigorous entrance exams have
been re-established for Chinese
colleges and reported the results.
“From the nearly 6 million
Chinese who took the exams this
year, only 180,000 were admitted,”
he said. Although college is free to
the average Chinese, students who
attend generally come from parents
who are college graduates. This
tends to deny admission to
students who haven’_t received a
good preparatory education and

emphasizes a class structure, .

according to Schulman.
The daily life in China illustrates

a slack period in its development, '

Schulman said. He noted that
there is not a very frantic pace and

—_._..—.—._._—...._—._-.—.....__...l

feels this is due to a surplus of
employees.

“The government offices and
universities are overstaffed and
underefficient,” he continued.
“The people don’t have a great
deal to do. It seems that when we
visited theaters and concerts that
people came just to get out of the
cold and have conversations.”

While the group was enroute
from Tokyo to Hong Kong on Dec.
15, President Carter announced the
establishment of diplomatic rela-
tions with China, to begin on Jan.
1, 1979. When the group arrived in
China two days later, they became
the ﬁrst Americans, in China since
the announcement.

“As a result,” Schulman said,
“we got red carpet treatment
everywhere.’ ’ ,

Schulman remarked that China is
greatly expanding its tourist trade
and trying to make parts of the
country more accessible to visitors.

“The Great Wall the day we
visited it was as crowded as the
Atlantic City Boardwalk,” he said.
“While these are beautiful places

‘ -bers to bring about needed changes in the Pitt Union

Program Council. Besides, serving as a member of

the assembly, Daley also has shown a willingness to

. i do‘ more than is required of himgas a member of ‘the
~-College Young Democrats.

,Daley’s position on allocations is also commend-

able. He lists service committees such as Govern-

mental Relations and Legal Awareness high on his

‘ list of priorities for funding. This shows a realistic .

view of what functions of student government can do
the most for students.

DeMatteo demonstrates the frankness needed by a
board member if student government is to act as the
student advocate tothe administration. Her willing-
ness to work to defend the students’ rights against
bureaucratic inefficiency is embodied in her com-
ments. “The administration looks at the SGB and
says ‘Nice kids, don’t bother me.’ The SGB should

‘ get advice from the student body and go to the ad-

’ _ m.inistration."’ ‘* 2 ’

Her position on allocations shows a responsible

'“ view of what groups deserve the most funds from
student government. DeMatteo said she feels
organizations that do the most programming should
receive priority because they affect the most students.
Giane1la’s service as a member of the Commuter
Affairs Committee gives her ample experience with

tees,” she said when questioned about the proposal.

Park, the last of the candidates we support, is’
probably the most experienced of the 13 prospective
board members. As chairman of the Public and
Governmental Relations Committee, Park has led
the new committee in such admirable projects as the
lobbying effort for a marijuana‘ decriminalization
bill.

His stand on Student Union renovations is a well-
informed position on a problem that could result in
students paying for renovation of University offices.

“I don’t think we should foot the whole bill when
the union isn’t exclusively for students,” Park com-
mented.

Although the board has little real power. it can act
as a student advocate, being a thorn in the side of the
University when necessary. Unfortunately, the
board steadily has become a glorified system to dole
out activitities fees in recent years and has forgotten
their responsibility to the students. We hope Daley,
DeMatteo, Gianella and Park -will remember this
duty if elected and fight for the students’ rights inside
and outside of the University.

, President Carter’s historic an-,

brought as much positive and

China between 1900 and 1949 have

review of historical perspective is
necessary.

China has always beena country
of disputing peoples and battling
nations. Its written history can be
traced back 4,000-« years, and
anthropologists have found the
“Peking Man” who lived_ some
400,000 years ago. For the past
3,000 years, China has given the
world exquisite paintings, beautiful
porcelains and statues, and new
philosophies of thought. It has
been governed by men such as
Genghis Khan and his grandson,
Kublai. It is a country that so
impressed Marco Polo during his
20-year stay in the 13th century
that it greatly , inﬂuenced his
writings. And two profound
systems. of thought have been
given to the world by Confucius
(who lived 1122-256 B.C.) and Mao
Tse-tung (1893-1976).

in China began with generations of
missionaries working in the
country. The missionaries who

China, had been overrun by the
world’s biggest powers and had
been divided into various spheres

government wanted its share of the

MorelMisconceptions on Sociobiology Debate --

There are a number of miscon-
ceptions in Steve Schneider’s letter
(The Pitt News, Jan. 8) concerning
sociobiology.

First, it should be blatantly
obvious to anyone past puberty that
women are predisposed towards
certain sex roles (men also for that
matter). No matter how hard a
male may try he cannot hear a
child. Whether this predisposition
is enforced culturally post-partum
is another story.

Secondly, there is truth to the
fact that sociobiology is-rooted in
the misconceptions of 19th century
science, but then so are chemistry,
physics and all other natural and
physical sciences. Do we damn

atomic theory because “phlogis-
tan” was a prevalent notion in its

_ past, or Newtonian physics because

of its assumption of the “ether?”

Sociobiology is a young ﬁeld and
admittedly many tenets are dis-
turbing, but it _takes reason to
disentangle truth--not a verbose
and preferential bias against them.

There is refusal to believe that
human behavior can contradict any
prediction of the theory of natural
selection. What is asserted is the
fact that those humans who behave
in a manner that increases their
reproductive success will be
selected. If Schneider would have
read more modern sociobiology he
would understand that reproduc-

I am deeply disappointed in the
way my interview read in the SGB
candidate guide (The Pitt News,

In the ﬁfth paragraph the
interview read, “Commuters don’t
have anything to do here. Most of
it (allocations monies) should go to
the people who live here.” _

I feel this is a misquote which
makes me sound like I’m totally

against the commuters. That is not
the case. ,\

What I said is:

What came next for a decade was
complete isolation from the rest of

tive success means reproductive
success of the individuals’ genes.
It is elucidation of those para-
meters and variables in the
selection process rather than hard
and fast “rules” of reproductive
success with which sociobiology is
concerned. Schneider seems to
think that the term “reproductive
success” can be taken before the
fact of reproduction itself.

Point three: it is true that there
are apparently no genes which
“control” the pathologies he has
listed, however, neither is there an
adequate understanding of those
pathologies to state the opposite
(homosexuality cannot, obviously,
be selected for). He is correct in

stating that they are complex
behaviors, but we must understand
the simpler. behaviors before we
might chance an answer to these.
Schneider seems intent on putting
sociobiology into a political frame-
work and metaphysic of his own

creation .

The last section of Schneider’s
letter describing an Utopian
scheme of scientiﬁc research is
very good and I both applaud his
sentiment and agree with many of
his points. The fact remains that
until a person frees himself from
his own willingness to believe in
any ideology of discrimination he
will be biased towards that
ideology. Sociobiology does not

late February, the topographic plan
and information for the automatic
programming of the trains and
boats in the display are complete.

Finally, the display is opened in
November and runs through the
end of February. This year’s
closing date is Feb. 25.

Although the size of the display
has not changed since 1959, the
accuracy and "detail has, Moser
said. 9 9

built up as it is today,” he added.
“Also, the amount of animation
involved has increased over the
years.”

This year’s 76-by-19 feet display
features 700 feet of track, six Lionel
trains, eight bridges, two tunnels,
one trestle, three boats that move

Buhl PIanetarium’s annual Railroad display features a circus.

~' South Gallery are

on a river, 61 hand-made anima-
tions, more than 1,000 ﬁgures and
over 25,000 individually planted
trees and shrubs.

The Railroad and village is
different every year, according to
Moser, with a key attraction that
acts ‘as the center of attention.

“This year’s key attraction is the
circus, which has not been in the
display for about ﬁve years,” he
said.

The Big Top circus includes
animated circus acts both inside
and outside the tent as well as a
side show. _

Aside from the circus, the
display includes an island amuse-
ment park, farms, a paper mill, a

coal town and a large city. Each 4

section contains its own anima-
tions.

In addition, the lights of the
periodically
dimmed as though night is falling,
causing hundreds of lights to go on

,in the homes, on the amusement

rides and elsewhere. ,

After a short while, the lighting
gradually brightensas day dawns
and the evening lights go out all
over the display.

Though the seasonal setting for
the Railroad and Village alternates
every other year only between
spring and autumn (this year is
spring), there is a similar winter
setting in the Mezzanine Gallery
adjacent to the larger display.

Pennsylvanians have known
about the Railroad and Village for
many years, but that’s not to
suggest that it is only a regional
attraction. The Miniature Railroad
and Village is world famous.

‘California suite’ — Vignettes from Neil Simon

By BOB LABRIOLA _

Pitt News Staff Writer

California Suite
Directed by Herbert Ross

A Evidently, ﬁlmmakers don’t believe there is such a concept as “too
much of a good thing.”

When screenwriters think the public needs an escape from reality,

A the market is fed a steady ‘diet of musicals and comedies. For a time,

disaster ﬁlms were in vogue. Then there were the sequels. The latest

 trend is for a director to sign as many established stars as possible in

order to get everyone’s favorite on the same ad poster.

Neil Simon has taken this idea and added his own twist in his latest
ﬁlm, “California Suite.” Instead of trying to work all those names (and

egos) into one story line, Simon uses his familiar cast in four separate .

vignettes, related only by the premise that all take place in the same

' resort hotel. ‘

During the beginning of the ﬁlm, director Herbert Ross introduces
the four situations and the characters. Through the use of editing, Ross
gives the viewer just enough information about a particular set of
characters to rouse the curiosity ‘and then moves on to the next
sequence.

For some unknown reason, however, Ross abandons this style
midway through the ﬁlm and succumbs to the iemptation to carry eacn
story to its conclusion before moving on to the next. And so, much of
what Simon tried to accomplish through juxtaposition is lost.

Simon offers the audience two realistic’ situations and two that could
be termed slap-stick if they were of higher quality.

Jane Fonda and Alan Alda offer the most touching performance as a
divorced couple ﬁghting for custody of their 17-year old daughter. Alda
portrays a man who is the antithesis of his television identity, Hawkeye
Pierce, while Fonda turns in her usual ﬁne performance; this time as a

woman who hides her emotions behind a steady stream of cynical

comments.
— Walter Matthau is a happily married.man who gets into serious-
trouble when his_brother, played by Herb Edelman, decides to offer
him a taste. of California’s good life. Matthau’s ensuing attempt to
prevent his wife from ﬁnding out becomes rather predictable and
te‘di61is‘." “ “'.““‘ ‘ "“"“’*“ “‘ ‘ ‘ ‘  ‘ "‘

Michael Caine and Maggie Smith play an English couple in town for
the Academy Awards banquet. It seems Smith is a nominee for the
Best Actress award, which allows Caine many opportunities to deal
humorously with her insecurities and eventual failure. This segment,

‘ along with the Alda-Fonda piece, is the class of the ﬁlm and offers the

audience real people coming to grips with real problems. Simon may

have had himself a better ﬁlm is heihad concentrated all his efforts on

these four people.

The ﬁnal segment involves Richard Pryor and Bill Cosby in a
slap-stick piece about two couples sharing their vacation. Ross tries a
trick the Marx brothers used successfully in “Night at the Opera,”
(stufﬁng an endless stream of people in a conﬁned space) but it fails to
compare to the original in method or content.

Even though the ﬁlm will win no awards for the actorsbr its makers,
it offers the viewer a rather entertaining 90 minutes with the assurance '
there will be no long wait in the ticket line.

‘Minute by Minute
The Doobie Brothers
Warner Bros.

Nearly everyone knows who the
Doobie Brothers are, but few old
fans would recognize their new
style that started around 1976 with
the release of “Takin’ It to the
Streets.”

The factors contributing to this

[change are the additions of Jeff

“Skunk” Baxter and Michael

' McDonald, formerly of Steely Dan

and the loss of Tom Johnson, a
founder of the group. McDonald is

‘rhythmic,

probably most responsible for the
more lyrical Doobies
style that appears on this album.
Fans will recall “Losin’ End,”
“Takin’ It to the Streets,” and “It
Keeps You Runnin”’ as classic
McDonald Doobie tunes from the
“Streets” LP.

This new tradition has continued
through “Livin’ on the Fault Line,”
their last album, and into their
newest, “Minute by Minute.”

McDonald’s voice has rarely
been in such clear form and his
lyrics seldom have conjured up the
images that come across on this
album. He has contributed

one-half of the album’s' songs.‘ '

 

Jane Fonda

Doobies — New Traditions

By FORREST BUFFENMYER

Most of them deal with lost or
broken love, as in “What a Fool
Believes,” a song co-written with
Kenny Loggins about someone who
just won’t see the light. Musically,
it recalls “It Keeps You Runnin’.”
The title track, “Minute by
Minute,” features some nice guitar
work by Baxter, faintly reminiscent
of his work‘ with Steely Dan.
Other tasty bits include “Here to
love You," another McDonald
tune (and an unusually optimistic
piece for him) and a beautiful duet

between T Patrick Simmons and

Nicolette Larson titled “Sweet

O|dfie|d’s Enchanting; The Babys Infantile

By PHILIP CONTES’
Pitt News Staff Writer
Sally Oldﬁeld
Water Bearer
Chrysalis

It is not often that one comes
across major new talent as is
exhibited in Sally Oldﬁeld’s first
U.S. release, “Water Bearer.”

The album is enchanting. The
spell takes hold upon opening the
cover and smelling the forest-
scented liner. From there Oldﬁeld
takes over, working magic with her
outstanding voice and her power-
ful poetic lyrics

 

fantasy.

She sings in an extremely clear,
wide-ranging soprano, capable of
expressing the innocent wonder of
a child or the earthy passion of a
mature woman, plus about every
emotion in between. Her lyrics
combine vivid folk images with

Her compositional talents are not
quite as great——however, that is
not to say that the music is at all
boring. In fact, Oldﬁeld makes
some very. interesting transitions
and syntheses unexpected on a
traditional folk album. Skillful
arrangements plus a wide variety
of instruments with Oldﬁeld herself

,:;‘¢:°*+€ma9s¢*,sr*+3€t‘«isi:t¢v»+rsvra~»:;:.*§‘;~a<;,x+s,>%a1‘ﬁ:r®+r,;»a.«.x*+<.;2r ,esgs,.t<gt . ~'t~

playing piano, guitar, mandolin,
synthesizer, glockenspiel and
others all contribute to the creation
of unique moods and sounds.
Favorite songs on the album are
hard

to pick but some are
standouts. “Water Bearer,” the
title song about a woman’s

awakening search for love, creates
a Jamaican atmosphere with its
shifting rhythmic patterns. “Wam-
pum Song” speaks eloquently of a
land where “there could be singing
beneath the sky/there could be joy
that does not ﬂv.” a
“Nenya” borrows Tolkien’s
eleven king chant and utilizes
African percussion poly-rhythms
and a very jazzy vibes background
by Frank Ricotti. “Night of the
Hunters Moon” expresses, a
passionate, sensuous search for
love with a funky blues beat.
“Child of Allah” is a simple,
beautiful melody with hopeful
lyrics of spiritual rebirth. ‘ ‘Song of
the Healer” uses a Mediterranean
folk melody, complete with man-
dolins, to create the sad mood of a

people who have lost their spiritual ’

guide. .
Oldﬁeld’s “Water Bearer” is a
rich and varied album, too rich to
be pigeon-holed into a folk
category. It is as special, magical
and unique as is Sally Oldﬁeld
herself. It should excite music
lovers of any kind. V

Babys
Head First
Chrysalis

The Babys consist of John Waite,
lead vocals and bass,’ Tony Brock,
drums, and Wally Stocker, guitars.
All are mediocre talents.

Waite’s voice. when he is ‘not

screaming, is not bad, although’

weak and lacking much range.~«

Brock barely keeps a simple rock
beat, and Stocker’s electric guitar
is rather infantile. Michael Corby,
who has left the band, since the
recording of this album, does not
play a bad piano. His keyboards,
and horn and string over-dubs
provide the only bright musical
moments on the album, in contrast
to lackluster performances by
Babys’ members.

The songs are standard rock
themes—losing love, ﬁnding love,
and drugs—superﬁcial treatments
done better countless times before.

Danny Kresky Enterprises, Inc. Production ’

 

Rising slightly above mediocre is
“Everytime I think of you.” Waite
sings well, within his limitations,
and the other Babys are mercifully
overwhelmed by piano and string
arrangements. “You Got It”
features Wally Stocker’s acoustic
guitar, which is much better than
his electric.

The other members are not
worth mentioning. Overdone,
simplistic, chordal progressions
and standard rock arrangements
characterize them. Both lyrics and
music lack _power or impact.
Overall, the album is a bore.

(Continued from page 8)

Simmons also contributes an’
, instrumental piece, “Steamer Lane

Breakdown,” which progresses
nicely; “Dependin’ On You,” a
true love tribute; and “Don’t Stop

to Watch the Wheels,”r a piece
featuring ex-Doobie Johnson on
vocals, as well as a nice horn
section. Of all the songs contained
herein, only this one preserves the
old Doobies sound.

The Doobies have become
strengthened and balanced, both
musically and lyrically, in the last
several years. In this album, their
talents are maturing, showing just
how far they’ve come. (They are

deﬁnitely not moving in a disco
direction, as some area reviewers
would contend.)

“The Gam bler” is a

By HARRISON C. STACKPOLE
Pitt News Staff Writer
Kenny Rogers
The Gambler
United Artists

Last Friday night, Kenny Rogers
received the American Music
Award for the most popular country
album of the year (“Ten Years of
Gold”). If “Ten Years Of Gold”
was good, “The Gambler” is
better. “The Gambler” is bound to
be one of the premier albums of
1979.

This album, as most Rogers’
albums, deals with people, primar-
ily lovers, and their problems in
different circumstances. The deep
voice of Rogers, blended in with
high quality string and keyboard
work, creates a Nashville sound
that is sure to please anyone with
an interest in_ country or easy
listening music. _ V e

The best cut on the album has to
be the title track, “The Gambler,”
a song that has received airplay on
some of the local radio stations.
“The Gambler” is a ballad with a
message that correlates life with
card playing. Rogers’ voice makes
the song, which might be consid-
ered to.be sung in a manner much

like another popular Rogers tune,
“ Lucille. ’ ’

Of the remaining 10 songs on the
album, eight show signs of
potential chart play. Mellow love
songs such as “She Believes In
Me,” “I Wish That I _Could Hurt
That Way Again,” and “The King
Of Oak Street,” are all well done,
telling a story to music worth
listening to.

For listeners who don’t enjoy laid
back love songs, there are upbeat
songs such as “Making Music For
Money,” “Tennessee Bottle”« and
an old Rogers hit, “Morganna
Jones.” a

r

It is rare these days for an album_

to emerge that has as many good
songs as “The Gambler.” It is a
disc well worth the money and is
bound to bring enjoyment to those
who listen to it.

  Correction

Due to a technical error in
Monday’s paper, the Roy
Buchanan review by Mark
Holan erroneously read that
Buchanan performed Jimi
Hendrix’ “Hey Jude.” The

song was actuallv “Hey Joe.”

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS REGARDING THE
PITT UNION PROGRAM COUNCIL
(Published by the Office of Student Activities)

How was the P.U.P.C. established?

The P.U.P.C. officially was recognized on June
IS, 1978 when the Office of the Vice Chancellor of
Student Affairs approved the contract between the
Office of Student Activities and the Student
Government Board.

How long is the contract in effect?

Three years — the 1973-79, 1979-80, 1980-81
academic ‘years.

What are the primary goals of the P.U.P.C.?”

1. Produce quality programs that reflect the needs
and interests of the student body. —

2. Expand the variety of programs to meet the
diverse interests of the student body. '

-3. Maximize the benefit of stable program dollars
by the effective use of facilities, eq‘uipment, and
personnel. \

4. Provide learning experiences for P.U.P.C.
members through participation in a planned

.. process of successful programming experiences.

5. Develop a program dimension for the Pitt
Student Union. :-

Did the P.U.P.C. centralize all programming?

NOl! The P.U.P.C. was created by combining
the Office of Student.Activities’ Student Union
Board and the Concert and Lecture Committees of
the Student Government Board which were both
advised by the Activities staff.

Did the P.U.P.C. receive an increase in funding
- ‘ from Student Government? 0

NOl! The P.U.P.C." will receive $110,000 from
the activities fee for each of the three contract
years. This amount, however, represents less than
what was allocated to the Student~Government
Board Concert and Lecture Committees in years
past. In addition, the P.U.P.C. programs during
all three terms while the former Student Gover-
nment Board Committees spent more money in Fall
and Winter. ' 0

How has the P.U.P.C. improved program of-
ferings?

The P.U.P.C. is responsible for providing
programs that serve a broad range of student in-
terests. By establishing five committees to replace

. the former Student Government Board Concert
and Lecture Committees, the P.U.P.C. provides
recreation, special interest, movie, video and
cultural programs, a broader range of entertain-

‘ merit events, as wellas lecture and music programs.

How do the programs of the P.U.P.C. effect the
program requests of student organizations?

The P.U.P.C. is responsible for‘providing a
broad base of programs in its designated areas that
appeals to a cross section of students. The
P.U.P.C. is not designed to do all the program-
ming on campus: and is not intended to replace the
legitimate program efforts of other student groups.
Governance groups and recognized student
organizations have been franchised by the Student
Government Board through the Committee on
Student Organizations to fulfill a specific purpose
outlined in their Constitutions and Bylaws. Accor-
dingly, they have an opportunity. to request
program funds from the Student Government
Board to fulfill their respective functions. When
combined, the programs of the P.U.P.C. and the
approved programs of governance groups and
student organizations, comprise the program
calendar for the year.

,What is the role of the P.U.P.C. in the Student

Government Board Allocations process?

Only advisory. The P.U.P.C. will serve in an ad-
visorycapacity only when requested by the Student
Government'Board or its Allocations Committee’.
-The decisions regarding approval of the program
requests of recognized student organizations and
governance groups rest solely with the Student
Government Board and its Allocations Committee.

What is the role of the P.U.P.C. in program calen-
daring?

The P.U.P.C. develops its preliminary program
calendar for the academic year by April I, of the

preceeding year. After April 1, the Student Gover- '

nment Board,d through the Allocations process,
approves ,,the program and operating budgets for
government, governance groups and recognized
student organizations. All Fall term reservation
requests are to be submitted to the Student Union
Reservations Office by June 1, Winter term
requests by October 15, and Spring term requests
by February 15. The Reservations Office then
determines the final disposition of ‘program
requests when it approves the use of University
space for the program.

Who determines what the P.U.P.C. programs?

Student members of the P.U.P.C. are respon-
sible for determining what programs are planned
and implemented. The P.U.P.C. contract between
the Student Government Board and the Office of
Student Activities defines program budgets and
guidelines, but does not specify the specific content

of each event. In addition, program decisions are 

based on the results at student interest surveys‘.

Besong Hits High Notes on Bar

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt gymnast Bob Besong uses
routines he once dreamt about,
including a maneuver only a

handful of collegians master.

“It’s called a ‘half-in, half-out.’
I use _it on my dismount off the high
bar,” Besong explained. “I picked
it up while watching the Olympics
several years ago.

‘ ‘I've progressed a lot technique-
wise,” continued Besong, a fresh-
man. “Coach (Frank) D’Amico has
taught me a lot of technical stuff

that I didn’t really need in high
school.

“Your routines have to be
perfect in college. You can get
away with a lot more in high
school.”

Besong graduated from Am-
bridge High School, perennial
Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athle-
tic Association (PIAA) champion.
Heavily recruited, Besong is the
Panthers’ top newcomer and so far
‘ has been one of their top all-around
performers.

His best event probably is the

. high bar, although. he was

runnerup on the still rings at last
year’s PIAA championship.

Besong (5-7, 134) considers
himself a “power” gymnast who
relies mainly on his strength and
quickness.

D’Amico added that Besong is
good this season but will be better
next year when he develops a style.

_Besong’s best meet was against
West Virginia; he ﬁnished second
in the all-around competition with
48.8 points.

The freshman aims for at least 50
points a meet.

‘ ‘When I hit the 50's. I ﬁgure I’m

up there with the top gymnasts in
the East,” siad Besong, who,
according to D’Amico, has “all-
America capabilities. ’ ’

The Panthers’ next meet is Feb.
3, against Temple.

“I think we’re going to do better
against Temple than we did against
Penn State,” Besong said. f‘We
have a couple of weeks to get our
routines in gear.

“We knew Penn State would be
strong. We didn’t get as fired up
for them as we will for Temple.”

Pitt lost to the Nittany Lions

7 Saturday.‘

Coach Dick Bradshaw took his
Pantherette swimmers to Puerto
Rico for a 12-day vacation, but after
nearlytwo weeks in San Juan’s sun
they were happy to head toward
Pittsburgh.

And it wasn‘t the fact they were
missing school, not the surround-
ings, that dimmed thesun and the
surf of San J uan. Rather, it was the
twice-daily workouts at the Univer-
sity of Puerto Rico that had some
Pantherettes longing for Pittsburgh

and the resumption of their season.

“I‘ve worked harder this year.

“and it has paid off. This team has

a lot of spirit and potentialutevery-__

one has been doing well.”

The Pantherettes’ ﬁrst winter
term meet will be held Saturday
against Penn State at 1:00 p.m.
Penn State was ranked third in the
East after last season, while the
Pantherettes ﬁnished fourth. .

“We’ll have to hustle to beat
them,” Bradshaw said. ;“They’re a
well-balanced team.”

“We’ve been doing a lot of hard
work,” he added. “Penn State has
the potential to be second this
year-...if we’re first.” .

final irony of the body snatchers is
that they would want. to look like us in

after they’d taken over, they’d turn
back into the little piles of tobacco
leaves they came from. The Donald
Sutherland pod is stuck with the
same flyaway hair his original had.-
All that is missing is what made him an
individual--his feelings, his mind and

escape and they deliver.

So here we are, fellow escapees.

Karate Teaches Women Mental, Physical Union

By ANGELE ELLIS

On a Wednesday night in Pitt's
Falk School, white-belt karate stu-
dents—-some waring street clothes,
some wearing the traditional gi—are
practicing the front stance. The
women step forward, bend and lock
their front knees, put their guards
up, and exhale sharply. Meanwhile,
one can hear the grunts and thuds of
women in the gymnasium next door,

: where an advanced karate‘ class is.

kicking at targets.

“More women are far ‘more scared
now,” said Bobbi Snyder, chief in-
structor of the Feminist Karate _Union,
an independent, non-profit
organization that holds classes in Falk
School beginning. every January,
April, June and September. “The
feminist movement has raised‘
women's consciousness of rape.
Some women are here because they
were raped or had friends who were
raped‘, but many come for preventive
education." , .

The Feminist Karate Union, which
had 12 students when it was formed

Win 1974, now teaches approximately
" .200 women during each 10-week

term:- according to Snyder.’ j‘Growth
has been great,’.’ she said. -“Many
students go on from a beginning self-

, cupaﬁons

defense class to advanced karate
classes. They get motivated.”
Students range in age from 13 to
75, Snyder Said. and their oc-
include student,
housewife, physician and coal miner.
“Everyone’s here for the same pur-

pose, and that’s the cohesive mesh 1

of the group. There's no
stereotypical student, and that’s
good. A rapist doesn’t care whom he
rapes.” '

The Union started a children's
karate class, for boys and girls aged
8 to 12, this year to combat the
sexual victimization of children,
Snyder said. ~

To deaL with the anxieties many
women have about rape and defen-
ding themselves, Snyder said she
combines instruction with talk, “to

Nino’s: Viehyssoi
  . RN01-th Oakland

By STEPHEN Knou. 5

Busy North Craig~Street seems
miles away once one steps inside

 Nino’s. A courteous staff member

consults the reservation book and

’ leads one to a table in the main dining
, room or the small bar annex. Subtly
— decorated in » brown, black and

beige, with arm chairs trimmed with
heads, Nino’s is
reminiscent of an exclusive private
club. "

The menu on the night we visited
was adapted to celebrate Super Bowl
XIII; each entree was prefaced by the
name of some supersteeler. This
got to-be tedious, as each patron had
to order a Jon Kolb, Lynn Swann or
Mel Blount instead of the appropriate
meat, poultry or fish dish. The menm
is thorough, however, offering a
variety of beef, veal and seafood en-

‘ trees. Entrees may be ordered a la

carte. For an additional $1.25, one
gets a complete dinner, which in-
cludes soup or juice, potato or pasta,
vegetable, salad, dessert and coffee
or tea. Especially good are the daily

' dinner specials, (or Art Rooney’s

Features), which offer something to

u-ﬁ-

please every palate, and are
reasonably priced.

Dinner began with a small cup of
Petjt Marmitte, a hearty mixture of
beef- and chicken" consommes,
onions, carrots and beef, served
steaming hot. .- For 60 cents more,
onecould have chilled vichyssoise,
served on a bed of crushed ice. A
salad of crisp lettuce, cherry
tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers

arrived with the house dressing, a
mild, creamy Italian. Chicken cordon)
bleu, a $7.95 dinner special, proved
to be an excellent choice: a deboned
breast, stuffed with ham and swiss
cheese, dipped in a batter and
cooked in butter. The entree arrived
on a very hot plate, a welcome depar-
ture from the usual cold plate and
cold food. Accompanying the
chicken was a mound of light and fluf-
fy rice pilaf, and a pleasantly sweet
dish of carrots vichy. _

Also among the night’s dinner
features were Virginia Spots almon-
dine ($9.75): flaky filets of fish, dip-
ped in batter, pan-fried in butter and
lemon. and topped with white wine
and sliced almonds; and medallions of

beef ($10.95), thin slices of filet
which were cooked rare, as ordered,
and covered in a brown sauce.“ The
wine list is adequate, with a good
selection of domestic and imported
choices. It features Paul Masson
wines, which can be-ordered by the
glass, half or full carafe, or bottle. A
small carafe of chablis ($3.00) went
well with the fish and chicken, while a
glass of burgundy ($1.50) com-
plemented the beef medallions.

The table was cleared of plates
and crumbs before one was asked to
choose from an array of sinful desser-
ts. Included were Peach Melba
($1.95), Pear Helene ($1.25) and
chocolate cheesecake ($1.75), the
eighth deadly sin for chocolate
lovers. One also could pick a flavor of
ice cream included in the price of the
dinner and top it off with a liqueur
($2.25), such as Kahlua, Sabra or
Anisette. Also included in the dinner
price was an excellent cup of coffee.

Although service was erratic, the
wonderful fare and reasonable prices
made up for it. The pace was quite
relaxed; dinner took about two hours.
Dinner for one came to $12.81’ in-
cluding tax and tip, which is not bad
for a restaurant ofsuch high quality.

Nino’s, 214 North Craig Street,

621-2700. Open forlunch and din-
ner Monday through Saturday.
Reservations suggested. Dinner
jackets are required after 6 pm.

Unpredictable Cagers Need (More
Than Just ‘One for the Road’ 

Forecasting Pitt’s remaining basketball fortunes
seems as formidable a task as predicting the winner
of a game in which the Panthers hold a substantial
lead with virtually no time remaining.

Though the Panthers have more talent than a 6-6
team should possess, they also have demonstrated of-

ten and well that they’re not going to win many.

games away from the Field House. ‘In fact, it is
possible they will enter the Eastern Eight tournament
without a single victory not accomplished either at
the Field House or on a neutral couﬁ, though Pitt
could upset Duquesne, Penn State or West Virginia
on the road.

And any team that can lose to Cincinnati at home
also is no sure bet to turn the homecourt advantage
into victory against a team such as Rutgers. For each
Iona or Duke on Pitt’s remaining schedule there is a
Hawaii or Mercyhurst at home. For that reason, Pitt

should finish its regular season a\shade above .500,  A

which, considering Pitt’s players, is a few shades too
light...

It was said when Ed Scheuermann left the Pitt
lineup that the Panthers would become a quicker
team. That quickness came in handy against the likes
of Rio Grande and Massachusetts but in recent
games the only thing Pitt has done’ quickly is lose
leads...

While his team has encountered adversity, Terry
Knight has become a solid basketball player. Taller
than Sam Clancy, a better ballhandler than some

guards and a better shooter than any teammate,
Knight has been noticed by pro scouts and valuable
almost beyond description to his team. ..

Clancy’s teammates say*Pitt’s stunning sophomore
is able to “turn it on and off.” “It” the talent to con-
trol is the talent to control basketball games more
completely than any recent Panther, perhaps in-
cluding Bill Knight.

But Clancy’s bursts of well-directed brawn have
been brief and infrequent this season and that could
be more ominous than Clancy’s most imposing slam.
If Clancy allows his team’s fortunes to affect his at-
titude or play, his talents could be wasted as much as
Gordon Jones’ were this season...

If Clancy is assigned Gene Banks when Pitt travels
to Duke, who is going to watch Mike Gminski?
And who is going to be able to watch what
haDpens?... -

Dan Marino, who likely would require fewer than
10 passes to reach the Cathedral from the high school
(Central Catholic) at which he became a scholastic

all-American quarterback, is crazy if he doesn’t at- .

tend Pitt. . .
If Foge Fazio has much to do with it, Marino will

. play at Pitt Stadium next season. A fortunate result

of the recent Pitt football shakeup was Fazio’s
promotion... ‘
Dave Olinger appears to have assumed Sonny
Lewis’ old spot in Tim Grgurich’s doghouse, though
not for the reasons that often sent Lewis there.’
Olinger’s early reputation at Pitt largely rested on his
shooting. Terry Knight and Pete Strickland are the
best shooters of those players who seem likely to play

much for Grgurich in the near future, and neither of ,

those ‘players has the eye or touch of Larry Harris,
whose sniping has been missed when Pitt’s opponents
have employed zone defense. ..

Duquesne is facing problems hauntingly similar to
those encountered by Pitt when the Panthers last im-
ported a large group of heralded newcomers. Billy
Clarke quit the team recently, which didn’t hurt the
Dukes much because his contributions had been
negligible, but Dukes coach Mike Rice took Clarke

back recently. And B.B. Flenory continues to behave F

irrationally (this is the guy who once taunted Sam
Clancy while unarmed). . . .

A new term is needed to describe the action of an
athlete leaving school,after his eligibilty has expired,
since graduation is not the correct term in more cases
than ohe could count... ‘

Miami Security Works‘Hard to Prevent ‘Blacklsunday’ .

MIAMI—Not taking any chance
of Super Bowl Sunday becoming -a
“Black Sunday,” Miami police has
assembled an anti-terrorist strike
force that is undergoing disaster

’ prevention training and will closely

monitor the crowd at the profes-
sional football championship game.,

Authorities are keenly aware of
the heavy promotion CBS television
is giving the movie, “Black
Sunday,” which will air shortly
after the game this weekend.

‘ Invthe ﬁlm, a group of terrorists
hijack the Miami-based Goodyear
blimp for a suicide mission at the

Orange Bowl on Super

be keeping an eye on the blimp at
"Opa-locka airport this Sunday.
While police say they have
received no indications of pending
Super Bowl terrorism, “The threat

Four Women Vie For Position

Against Cleveland State Tonight

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staff Writer
When the women’s basketball
team takes the court against
Cleveland State tonight, one of four
candidates will be called upon to ﬁll
the second guard spot left vacant

with an injury to Pantherette

Debbie Lewis.

Coach Jean Balthaser said that
she will name the starting lineup
shortly before game time.

“We have four girls trying for

 the position of guard and all will be

considered. Dana Elder (senior),
Peggy Dugan and Kathy Paczkow-
ski (juniors) and Ann Rehm

-(freshman) play at guard and we

want to try to use all of them.”

Paczkowski, who started as a
freshman, was forced to miss most
of her sophomore year after she
tore ligaments in her ankle.

“I knew I had lost my starting
position and would have to work
hard in order to get it back,” said
Paczkowski. “I don’t think that
conﬁdence was the big problem, it
was the fact that I had such a long
lay-off with the injury.”_, . '

“Right now I feel that I am back
to normal and I’m 100 percent
physically OK.”

Commented Balthaser: “Be-
cause Kathy missed so much of last
season it took a lot of work for her
to come back. As she plays more
and more, her rl_1yt_l1_rn_> is_comin_g_

back and she is getting better every
game.”

“I consider Kathy to be the best
ball handler of all our guards. She’s
also a ﬁne passer and shooter.”

Dugan has had four knee
operations in the past three years.
This kept her from playing most of
last season, although she started
the Pantherettes”last game against
Old Dominion.

“It had been two years since I
had played, so it was just like

learning things over again when I

came back to play,” she said. “I
had questioned if I wanted to try
again. It all added up to regaining
my conﬁdence.” ,

“I knew I didn’t have to,.but that

Bowl p

..k

said Capt. Mike Cosgrove, who will
coordinate the strike force.

“The whole point of terrorism is
publicity. A disruption of the
Super Bowl would be a big plus for
any of those terrorist groups.”

Cosgrove, who heads the city's
S.W.A.T. operations, said the two

it (her conﬁdence) would come

back in just a matter of time. I had A
doubts and so did everyone else.”.

‘ ‘Peg has the best head out‘ there
and great ability to control the
teain,” said Balthaser. “That was
_a big factor in inserting her into the
lineup.” 2

“Everyone wants to start,” said
Dugan, “the important thing,
though, is to “get the job done
whenever you’re in there.”

The decision is up to Balthaser
and her players have said they will
accept it readily. 2

“We respect her decision on wire
will play,” commented Dugan,
“after all, she is the brains behind
this team.”

dozen strike force members are
being trained in sniper and bomb
detection, hostage negotiation,
kidnapping prevention, dignitary
protection and demonstration con-
trol.(

From a command post atop the
Orange Bowl press box, Cosgrove
will direct about 10 plain-clothes
intelligence ofﬁcers trained in

terrorist identiﬁcation while the -.

remaining members will be scat-
tered throughout the stadium for

quick access to ‘known danger ‘
h areas, including the playing ﬁeld.

Cosgrove said a hostage negotia- 1.

tion team will be at the stadium and
a police helicopter will be “stashed
away within seconds of the Orange
Bowl,” with a bomb truck and
technician nearby.

The ofﬁcer said the unit’s
arsenal will include semi-automatic
weapons, repelling devices, heli-
copters, 130-foot ropes and person-
nel in S.W.A.T.-ready response
uniforms. , /

.“Let’s say I get a. berserk
gunman holding hostages in a
stadium bathroom,” Cosgrove
said. “The big thing is that I’d
rather overkill. it with preparation
than not be ready...

“Terrorism is coming. You’re
going to see it. It’s just a matter of
time.”

The Office of Residence Life in conjunction with the Student Health
_Service’s Peer Medical Aid Program (PMAP) will be sponsoring
weekly CPR Certification sessions starting January 24. Sessions
will be taught by the “Heart-Savers” from the City Emergency
Medical Services and certified PMAP members. American Heart
Association Certification will be received.»

THIS AFFECTS YOU

in November, the Student Government Board voted to create a Constitutional Review
Committee to study the present Student Government Constitution and make recommen-
dations for possible changes to be placed on the ballot as referenda during January's

Student Government elections.

The final recommendation of the Review Committee is an entire new constitution. The
major changes are listed and described be/o w.

1 — All undergraduate students have the right to vote. Under the present Constitution
only full-time undergraduates may vote in STUDENT Government elections.

2 — The size of the Student Government Board will be increased from one president and
six board members to one president and eight board members. The reasons for the
additional two members are:  

0 better representation ratio
0 division of work load between board members
0 more diverse backgrounds and opinions

3 — The time of the Student Government elections will be the second week in November
rather than the third week in January.

0 this will allow the student organization budget process to be finished before
the end of winter term, while students are still on campus 2
0 better weather will draw out voters
0 December graduates can run for the board
The board will assume office the first day of the winter term.

4 — The Student Assembly will electits own officers.

5 — To improve representation, the Allocations Committee will benine members instead
of eight and the Judiciary will be seven members instead of nine.

Copies of the entire Constitution are available in the Student Government Office —

305 S.U., the Office of Student Activities — 107 S.U., and The Pitt News drop off
points. ' 2
