Pih‘ names new
clean to Katz
Business School

Anthony Breznican

 

Pitt’s Katz School of Business has a new dean, and
experts say ﬁnalizing the undergraduate program and
maintaining an “outstanding faculty” are his two biggest
challenges.

Currently a business school dean at the State
University of New York at Buffalo, Frederick W. \Vmter
will start work in the Katz school on July 1. He will replace
Andrew R. Blair, who has sewed as interim dean for
almost a year.

Blair said he will continue teaching graduate courses
and remain the director of the school’s International
Business Center.

VV1nter was unavailable for comment

On top of overseeing the graduate school, VV1nter will
also be responsible for continuing to integrate the new
undergraduate degree program, the College of Business
Administration.

"The undergraduate program began two years ago,
and as we move into the third year, phasing it in becomes
very important,” Blair said. “The need for new faculty
comes in, and the new dean will have the responsibility of
maintaining or improving the quality of that faculty.”

Keeping a strong faculty in the ‘school is Wmter’s sec-
ond most important responsibility, Blair said.

He added that the new clean must be “ever—watchful
to make sure Katz stays competitive.”

According to Provost James Maher, Wmter’s accom-
plishments at SUNY-Buffalo, include redesigning its
MBA Pﬂogfam. starting an intenrational MBA program
and creating ties with alumni, donors and local businesses.

“[Wmter’s] administrative efforts have been coupled
throughout his professional career with a steady stream of
exceptional scholarship,” Maher said. “I ﬁrmly believe
that Dr. Winter is ideally qualiﬁed to lead the development
of the Katz [schools] as they deﬁne their future and build
upon past successes.”

Winter brings almost 30 years of experience to the
job and specializes in market strategy, market research and
market segmentation.

He currently serves on the boards of several major
corporations in addition to his academic responsibilities,
and has also been published in journals such as
Management Science and the Journal of Marketing
Research

“He’s got plenty to work at, but he’s a person very
able to communicate with people after working a full
range of disciplines,” Blair said. “Successful deans are
ones who communicate well with people who have a dif-
ferent point of reference.”

Wmter’s appointment comes after the resignation of
Dean HJ. Zoffer last year. Zoffer leﬁ citing a desire to
retum to teaching.

New company named for
athletic department publici

‘Kevin Lilley

 
 

Add another step to the restructuring
of Pitt athletics, but make it a small one.

With heavy emphasis on the upcom-
ing football season, Poppe Tyson, the
public relations ﬁrm that worked on the
promotion of the 1994 Major League
Baseball All-Star_Game, has been hired
to assist the Pitt athletics department in
its advertising campaigns.

But, instead of the public relations
blitz the firm performed for the rnid-sea-
son classic and many other events, Pitt
Athletics Director Steve
Pederson said Poppe Tyson —
will serve only as a consul-
tant on ad production and
placement.

“In terms of, ‘Is this a
big deal?’ No, notpa1ticu1ar-
ly,” said Pederson.

He said Poppe Tyson
was chosen out of numerous
city public relations ﬁrms
based on what the firm said
it could do for Pitt. No long-
term advertising campaign is
in place now or will be in the
near future.

Ofﬁcial planning ses-
sions between ﬁrm and ath-
letics department personnel
are slated to begin in the
next few weeks, according
to Ray Werner, senior_ vice president of
Poppe Tyson.

Ron Wahl, assistant athletics direc-
tor for media relations, stressed commer-
cial placement as the f1rm’s primary

duty.

‘Right now, this is only an advertis-
ing account,” said Wahl. “The ﬁrm may

be used for public relations for special

events some time in the future.”

‘ Despite his company’s limited
agreement with Pitt athletics, Werner
said he is still excited about the venture.

“I think you’re going to see a new,
fresh spirit,” said Werner. “[This is] a
great opportunity to build awareness of

 

the program.”

The firm holds accounts with t
University of Pittsburgh Medical Cent
as well as Mellon Bank, but does It
specialize in sports-related marketing.

However, Poppe Tyson did busine
with the Pittsburgh Penguins in the pas
and produced the commercials currentl
running on KDKA television for the
Family House Invitational.

Werner, Chepelski and Partners —- a
ﬁrm acquired by Poppe Tyson in a merg-
er — worked with Pitt football promo-
tion in years past. Werner, who served as
president of WCP before the merger,

.  .  said the prior experience
with the team would
assist in the yet-to-be-
developed marketing
stiategy, but called the
recent deal “a brand new
opportunity.”

. This experience with
Pitt football did not enter
into Pederson’s decision
making one way or the
other, he said. The ath-
letics director said he
was not aware of any
work done for his
department by WCP in
the past.

While the advertising
campaign is in the pre-
planning stages, Werner
said that elements of

direct marketing and interactive technol-

ogy — speciﬁcally the intemet — could
be involved.

However, Pederson said such mech-
anisms, while discussed in the assess-
ment of what candidates could do for
Pitt, are not part of the current deal. He
would not discuss any speciﬁcs, saying
only that Poppe Tyson “will lend some
expertise” in the upcoming athletics
department advertising campaigns.

Hallmark Tassone, Inc., which cur-
rently holds the public relations account
for the Penguins, and Blattner Brunner,
Inc. were among the other ﬁrms consid-
ered.

State budget grants Pitt
$4.5 million more in funding

Jennifer Sinfelt

 

Pitt will receive $4.5 million more in
funding from the Commonwealth of
Pemrsylvania this year than it did last year,
according to University ofﬁcials.

Govemor Tom Ridge recently signed
into law the_act that grants Pitt $153,182,000.
The commonwealth appropriation, Act 38A,
is 3.1 percent higher for ﬁscal year 1998 than
it was for 1997, according to Ann Dykstra,
Pitt’s commonwealth relations director.

Fiscal Year 1998 begins July 1.

The resulting increase was 1 percent
higher than what Ridge had originally pro-
posed when he ﬁrst made his budget recom-
mendations to the General Assembly.

Dykstra said the increase was a result of
a lobbying effort between Pitt and other pub-
lic universities and colleges in Pennsylvania,
including Penn State University, Temple
University, Lincoln University, the State
System of Higher Education and community
colleges.

Information from Pitt’s governmental
relations otﬁce shows that:

°The1percentthatwasaddedonisnot
guaranteed for the Fiscal Year 1999. It must
be used for special projects.

- The amount of money that Pitt will
receive as part of its appropriation for special
projects is $1,486,000.

- Pitt‘s commonwealth appropriation
was increased by exactly $4,617,000 this
year.

- Of the $153 million that Pitt receives
as its commonwealth appropriation,
$134,880,000 is for education and general
expenses.

The rest of the money is doled out
among disadvantaged students through vari-
ous school organizations.

According to Dykstra, Pitt will also
receive money from the govemor’s general
ﬁmd. This money is allotted for speciﬁc pro-
grams such as Legal Advocacy for Older
Pennsylvanians, Higher Education
Equipment Grants, the Pittsburgh Cancer
Institute, and the Pittsburgh Supercomputing
Center.

The govemmental relations oﬁicefs ﬁg-
ures also show where several appropriations
will indirectly beneﬁt Pitt.

These include the 7 percent increase that
the Pennsylvania Higher Education
Assistance Agency received PHEAA grants
need-based ﬁnancial aid to Pennsylvania res-
idents.

Seven million dollars is also appropriat-
ed for Link-to—I.earn, a statewide program to
develop a telecommunications system link-
ing higher education, basic education, gov-
emment and communities. By linking to
higher education, the program should indi-
rectly beneﬁt Pitt, Dykstra said

Reno 

the help and support he needs to break his
addiction.

“Crack addiction is a worse prison than
anywhere we can send them. It is a revolv-
ing door, and lawyers have more to do than
just get the conviction.”

In civil matters, Reno told the new grad-
uates they should be constantly thinking of
the welfare of their clients.

“If that means working with the other
side to reach a settlement, than that is what
you should do,” she said.

“Too often lawyers do battle just so they
can say they won. In the meantime, they
have wasted years and thousands of dollars
of their c1ient’s money.”

Raising one of President Bill Clinton’s
themes, the attorney general also urged the
graduates to consider public service.

“Too many Americans do not have
access to a lawyer and do not have access to
justice,” Reno said. .

She recounted the personal rewards she
received from her own experience as a spe-
cial prosecutor in Florida.

Appointed to investigate the case of a
man who had been convicted 21 years earli-_
er in the poisoning death of his seven chil-
dren, Reno was responsible for getting him
released. . '

“I found the evidence insufﬁcient to
have charged him then, and it was still insuf-
ﬁcient to bring a charges now,” Reno told
the audience. ’

“For the rest of my life, I will remember
looking over my shoulder at a man who

walked out of the courthouse a free man for
the ﬁrst time in 21 years.”

Reno said a lot of the problems in our
society can be traced back to a lack of pub-
lic service, especially in education.

“What good are all the prisons going to
be 18 years from now, if we’re not going to
teach children right from wrong and help
them to develop a conscious?” she asked.

“Work with school children to teach
them to resolve conﬂicts without knives and
violence. Solve problems in public, as well
as in your private practice,” Reno advised.

Although Reno is not a mother herself,
she became the legal guardian of a pair of
15-year-old twins when a close friend of
hers died in 1984.

When one of them graduated from col-
lege magna cum laude, Reno said the girl
hugged her and said, “I couldn't have done it
without you.”

‘That is as rewarding as any profession-
al achievement I have ever had,” Reno said.

The crowd of graduates, their families
and friends gave Reno a standing ovation at
the end of her presentation.

Peter Shane, dean of law school, pre-
sented Reno with a crystal vase to com-
memorate the occasion at the end of the cer-
emony.

Reno was escorted by Secret Service
agents immediately after the” program to a
conﬂict resolution seminar that was being
held at Duquesne University. She was the
keynote speaker at that event Saturday
night.

Reno should be more attentive

Janet Reno gave the com-
mencement address to graduating
Pitt law students Saturday after-
noon. Reno told the new graduates
they should be true to the spirit of
the law; she said the ultimate goal
should not be winning a case, but
rather it should be ﬁnding the best
solution for all parties involved.
She also told them to be active in
their communities.

At the same time, Reno com-
pletely ignored the public assembly
outside of the hall that was vying
for her attention. They were
demanding a federal investigation
into the Jonny Gammage case.
Reno did not even acknowledge
their presence.

It seems to us that this is insen-
sitive and hypocritical behavior.

For someone who is giving com-
mencement speeches to law
schools and who is supposed to be

the leader of our legal system,

Reno_ has shown very little concern
for the public interest that she
claims is so important.

There is more to being a leader
than just telling others what to do.
Successful leadership must be done
by example. Reno’s example is not
becoming of her position.

As for a federal investigation of
the Johnny Gammage case, we are
supportive of the idea. If the evi-
dence supports prosecuting of the
officers involved, then it should be
done. If the evidence does not sup-
port further action, then no harm
will have been done by a federal
investigation. ‘

If it bothers your sexual
partner, it's weird

 

My phone rang late one night It was
Louise. Shecalledtotalktomeabouther
relationship. Girls do this kind of thing, you

know. She moved in with her boyfriend asfew '

months ago, and the last I heard, everything
was cool, except for the one locked desk
drawerhetoldhernevertoopenandthefact
thattheydidn’tseemtobehavingsexa_s
much as she would like. She asked me if I
thought it was odd . 8

‘‘Is what odd?” I asked, sensing the tip of
anicebergIwasn’tatallsureIwantedtorun
into. She took anotheraudible swallow ﬁom
the glass of Chardomray Iknew she’d be
drinking and blurted out that they “only have
sex about twice a month”

I scarmed my mind for a suitable
response. Louise has been married and
divorced twice, both times to ﬂashy drug
dealer types who were, respectively, psychot-
ic and controlling, anddrug-crazed and dan-
gerous. The guy she is living with now, on the
other hand, is a handsome 42-year-old invest-
ment banker who votes conservative and
pays his bills; in short,he is the antithesis ofa
ﬂashydrugdealerandﬁtsthesororityhand-
book deﬁnition of perfect husband material.
Mynrindwasstillscarmingoldissuesof
Cosmo and my bio and psych textbooks for a
response to her question; I started making
noises to the effect that quality is often prefer-
able to quantity and whatever gets you
throughnight,etceteraSoItookaswigof
Chianti and continued rolling in this direction.

Imustadmitthatlcametoascreeching
halt when she said, “Yeah, I know. It’s not
only the frequency thing, but just listen to this
other thing, and tell me if you think it’s odd.”

“What else?”

“Well, the other day, when he was at
work, I‘ had to go into his study and the phone
rang. Ihadto write downanumber, andlwas
searching about for a pen when I accidentally
pulled on the, like, secret drawer It was
open”

“Did you ﬁnd a pen?”

“Er  no. Not exactly.”

“What did you ﬁnd?”

“Wﬂl you tell me if you think this is
odd?”

I sighed inwardly and sensed the iceberg,
lurking dark and cold and unimaginable
under the water. Louise continued: “Well, he
has these pictures from Hustler and
Penthouse.”

Because of the tentative way she said it,
I felt that launching into a lecture on the visu-
al nature of the male libido wouldn't be
appropriate, so I kept silent. She went on:

“Not the whole magazines, just some pic-
tures. The bodies, that is, with cut out photos
of my face superimposed on the [pause] bod-
res.”

“Your face?”

“Yes.”

“Cut out and stuck on naked pictures of
other women?” -

“Yes.”

“And you want to know ifI think that is
a little odd?” '

Perhapsit’s needlesstosaythat,atthis
point, I abandoned any attempts at tact and

. diplomacy and screeched loudly that I felt this

behavior was, in fact, extremely odd, but not
necessarily psychotic. However, I did advise
hertoaddressthetopicwithhiminsomeneu-
tral public arena where she could, if neces-
sary, escape unharmed

But what is odd? For many years, many
people have believed that, when it comes to
sex, whatever gets you through the night is all
right. Certainly I consider myself a liberal in
thisasmostotherareas;ifyoulikeit, your
partner consents and you hint no innocent
thirdparties,thenwhocares?Iguessthatpret-
ty much sums up my sexual philosophy and
that of most of my generation. So what is
odd?

' Ithinkthatwhatstruckmeasdistnrbing
in I.ouise’s scenario is, number one, she’s my
ﬁiend, and I don’t want to see her hurt again;
andnurnbertwo, sheisnothappy withher
current arrangement, otherwise she wouldn’t
be calling across continents at midnight.
‘Therefore, yes, I do think her man’s behavior
is odd. And furthermore, so does my 70-year-
oldfather. Italkedtohimjustaslwas writing
this column, and Dad said that he thought the
strange part would be if Louise’s boyfriend
preferred his “collection” to having real sex

On the other hand, I suppose, there’s
nothing intrinsically wrong or harrnﬁrl about
cutting out pictures of your woman's head
and sticking them onto naked pictures of
other chicks. I daresay many others have
done this and not turned into that epitome of
unacceptable sexual behavior, the unfortunate
Jeﬂiey Dahmer. Maybe that one never even
occurred to Jeff. Maybe, if it had, lives would
not have been lost But would I stay with a
man who preferred a picture of me to the real
living breathing me, even a picture that was
partly me? Even if he wasn’t a drug dealer
and was an investment banker? Frankly, no. I
think it’s a little odd

p.r taylor thinks that the oddness of sexual
behavior depends greatly on context, but in
general, a consenting partner should be a
human being and not, say, a cat.

Ifyou were watching the Pirate game at
your Memorial Day cookout, you may
remember a few things. First of all, the
Buccos and Chicago Cubs hit two inside-
the-park home runs, but the ﬁrst was heavi-
ly contested

Sammy Sosa slid into home plate and
was tagged before he touched the plate on
his. Fortrmately for all sports fans in
Pittsburgh, the home plate umpire did not
see this and called Sosa safe.

Womack hit another. This one, oddly
enough, was theone that sparkedthebiggest
debate in Pittsburgh, since people bet on
whether Barry Bonds’ playoff batting aver-
age would exceed half of Mike Lavalliare’s
weight (It never did).

The debate still rages tonight, almost 48

Leyland left reliever Stan Belinda in the
game to face Francisco Cabrera in the bot-
tom of the ninth inning. For this case,
Leyland looked at all the angles:

Belinda had pitched well all year.
Cabrera was a pinch hitter and hit under .200

Smith breaks NCAA triple-jump mark

Pitt star leads Lady Panthers to second place in reg

 

Rachel lenzi

 

Trecia Smith does it all.

Not only did she dominate the
field events at this weekend’s ECAC
Championships and lead the Lady
Panthers to a second-place finish,
but she also set a new collegiate
triple jump record. With a jump of
46-8 (14.22 meters), Smith won first
place and shattered the 7-year-old

NCAA record of 46-0.75.

The ﬁve-time All-American and
indoor national long jump champion
added to her record by taking ﬁrst
place in the high jump and long
jump with leaps of '5-11.25 and 22-
0.75. In addition, Smith helped the
Panthers by placing third in the shot
put, throwing 46-8.25, and eighth in
the javelin, throwing 133-1.

 

 

Despite being edged out of the
finals in the discus, Smith single-
handedly gathered 28 points for the
Panthers on her way to being named
the Women’s Outstanding Performer

of the meet.

“The only way I can describe
Trecia Smith’s performance this
weekend is awesome,” said Head
Coach Steve Lewis.

Some women followed Smith’s
lead. Freshman Chantee Earl took
sixth in the 800-meter run with a
time of 2:06.98. However, Stephanie
Ellsworth concluded her senior year
in anticlimactic fashion, finishing
20th in the 10,000-meter run.

The two-mile relay team of Anna
Kohler, Tamika Dorin, Amy Francy
and Lynda Andros finished 10th in a
time of 9:04.59. Lewis was still

silly debate regarding when the last time the
Pirates had two inside—the—park home runs in
the same inning.

Some believe that there were two hit on
back-to—back pitches, but baseball fans
everywhere will never know.

This has probably changed the face of
statistics forever. Now, everyone will know
when the last time two inside—the—park home
runs were hit.

Is this good or bad for the game of base-
ball? It really doesn’t matter. If there is one
fan out there who wants to know, then it is
worth the time to write it down on a piece of
paper, or post it on a world wide web site so
that fans can enjoy baseball just a little more.

Pat Robertson is a columnist for The Pitt
News.

Flyers 

Chris Therien has been excellent
in the playoffs, and along with line-
mate Eric Desjardins, he will proba-
bly once again draw the number-one
line.

The defense is also bolstered by
the return of Kjell Samuelsson from
an injury. Samuelsson, at 235 pounds,
adds even more size to the biggest
team in NHL history.

The Flyer’s wingers must help out
defensively when Paul Coffey hits the
ice. While Coffey can still skate with
the best of them, his defensive lapses
can hurt the Flyers in a hurry if he sees
too much ice time against the Red
Wings Russian players.

Goalies:
Hextall replaced Garth Snow

 

FROM PAGE 6

early in the Rangers series and will be
the starter come Saturday. Hextall is
not the goalie that he once was, and
he’ll need some help from his team-
mates to keep the Red Wings from
lighting him up like they did Patrick
Roy in the Western Conference Finals.
Snow is a quality backup player, and
the Flyers will not lose much if they
need to call on him.

Coaching:

This is the area where the Flyers

give up the most ground to the Red
Wings. Coach Terry Murray has
done an excellent job in guiding the
Flyers through the marathon that is the
NHL season, but he cannot match
Scotty Bowman’s five Stanley Cup

rings.

Red Wings

While the Colorado Avalanche had
two scoring chances through two periods,
Detroit had 17. .

The other members of the offense,
Kris Draper and Brendan Shanahan,
should give the Flyers big men ﬁts. Both
are agitators and can easily get under the
skin of Eric Lindros and let him sit in the

. penalty box most of the series. Shanahan

will also chip in with a goal every now
and again.

Goalie:

The Red Wings’ blue-liners are not as
physical as the Flyers forwards, but they
willbeabletotakeahittoclearthepuck
like they did so well against Colorado.
They should also be able to clear Orange
jerseys out from in front of their stellar
goalie, Mike Vernon.

Vernon did not have to make very
many saves against the Avalanche, but he
made some spectacular ones. One key
ingredient to a Stanley Cup Champion is

 

 

. FROM PAGE 6 

a hot goalie, and Mike.Vemon deﬁnitely
is that.

If his defense can hold the Flyers to
under 20 shots — like they did Colorado
three times — Vernon could have three
shutouts.

Coaching:

Not only do the Red Wings have vet-
erans on the ice, but there are veterans
behind the bench as well. Head Coach
Scotty Bowman is arguably the best
playoﬂ’ coach of modern times. He won
four Stanley Cups with the Montreal

tened to the
shrill whines of

bands like

drenched with long hair, tight pants and
lots of toothy grins. Every video showed

girls — for, although no respectable 13-
year-old girl would admit to wanting to
beasextoy,weallwantedtobeatIrac-
trve.

So, at2l, my ﬁrstreactiontc learn-
ing that I would be interviewing Kip
Wmger, of “Seventeen” fame, was to
victimize him as I felt victimized by my
teenage daydrearns of being a trampy
groupie. I wanted to uncover the truth
behind the lusty farce that Winger had
been before “Beavis and Butthead”
ended his fantastic rock career.

Surprisingly, Winger is more gen-
uinethanIexpectedAﬁer10yearsof
criticism and embarrassment, the broad
srriiletliatwonhimsomanyheartshas
tinned serious and distant. His new
album, This Conversation Feels like a
Dream, reﬂects a darker, deeper Winger,
using acoustic instruments to accompa-
ny poigriant, soul-searching lyrics. His
musical metamorphosis has taken him
into the realm of Sting, David Bowie
and Peter Gabriel.

Orchestrated tracks like ‘ ere” and
“Endless Circles” pull the listener into a
surreal drearnland. Wmger’s experi-
mentation with ambient mstruments' is
sophisticated yet relaxing; he hasn’t
abandoned his electric guitar on songs
like‘ team”,butnowusesittoacoom-
parry stronger acoustical chords. 'lhe
Midwestern rock inﬂuences on
Winger’s music come out in “Naked
Sun” through adritthgdesertharrnony.

The songs on \ mversation slide in
and out of heartache and despair with
canyon-deep imagery. The years since
Winger’s MTV heyday have left him a
more somber but, ultirmtely, more
mature and fulﬁlling musician.

    

On the bir1h of Winger, the band:

When we wrote the ﬁrst album  I
was out on tour with Alice Cooper, and it
was ‘86. Bon Jovi was the hugest thing
ever. And Ratt, you warma talk about wom-
anizing motherfuckers, man. I went on this
worldwide tour and saw all these bands that
weren’t that great. I thought, shit, I can put
this together, no problem — write 10 really
good rock songs, get a record deal because
I’m a Midwestern kid from Colorado [and]
when I grew up I was into the Beatles. I
started playing when I was six, in a band
with my two older brothers. I wanted to be
a rock star. I set all those goals for myself
that I was going to achieve or die.

On Winger’s portrayal of women: ,

Even in the simplicity of the first
record, there’s enough depth for anybody to
realize that we didn’t go out of our way to
ponray women badly.

[When we produced the video for
“Hungry”,] I got all these treatments from
video directors that wanted to do mud
wrestling with chicks. [Ir1stead,] I wrote a
story about a guy who -—— ironically,
because this now happened to me last year
— lost his wife in a car accident They drive
off a cliff, and she dies, and he lives. He
can't live without her“, he decides to drive
himself off the cliff and at the last minute,
decides not to. ...

“Seventeen” was a true story about a
girl I met at a bar who was lying about her
age. Her real ID fell out of her purse.
Nothing ever happens in the song. We
never talked about consurnrriating any-
thing.

Everyone had a girl in their videos. But
we never did anything like Motley Crue’s
“Girls Girls Girls” with chicks swinging
from poles. [You kriow,] it was the thing to
do. We were there —— Bon Jovi was to our
left; Motley Crue was to our right. We
wanted to be big rock stars, so [to a point]-
you bend your morals enough to somehow
believe that it’s the thing to do. Looking
back, it wouldn’t have mattered if I had

On going solo dter four Winger alaums:
Conceptually, [Winger] was going
nowhere. I had to make a break for it.

On Winger guitarist Reb Beach:

I was the motivating force behind
Winger. Reb never even read the lyrics. He
would do his riffs and sing the background
vocals. Often, he wouldn’t read the words,
let alone know what the song was about.
That’s part of the reason I’m not even into
doing Winger anymore, because, personal-
ly, I'm diﬂ"erent.

On luﬁng h's than:

But we were never so huge; the fallout of

Musically, I haven’t fulﬁlled my dream

——because when you do a sound like that,

people want you to keep doing it over and

back.” It ain't coming back. Slaughter,
Warrant and Motley Crue can all get back
together and pretend it’s coming back and
think tliey’re the great white horse that’s
going to bring it back, but they’re not.

So for me, I just hit the drawing board
and create something that is absolutely me
and give up limos and gold records and all
that shit. I don’t give a fuck about all that
stuﬁi Because I want to listen to my record
and say, ‘This is who I am”

On the observation, ‘There’: something

Local funk rockers Bitter
Delores celebrate new CD
at Graffiti release party

Neither barroom rock nor
sloppy garage rock, Bitter
Delores is in its own category as
one of Pittsbu1gh’s aspiring local
bands. Hard, powerful, clever
altema—pop licks are the group’s
strong points. Never too shy to be
loud on stage, Bitter Delores is
deﬁnitely not background music
for socializing and often doesn’t
get asked back to bars that cater
to boozing instead of music.

Singer Kate Beck has the
most intense female voice in
Pittsburgh. Beck’s compelling
wails give Bitter Delores’ new
CD, 200 Choir Children Can’:
Be Wrong, its musical punch.
Bitter Delores goes balls—out on
this one that, thank goodness, is a
far cry from numerous other
attempts made by funk bands
emerging all over the Steel City.

Bitter Delores won second
place in the Graﬁiti Rock
Challenge this year (with Push
prevailing in first place). The
band’s prize, free studio record-
ing time, allowed the new CD to

The tracks on the new CD
aren’t pa1ty—friendly, but have an

Winger

I was always trying to do
the right thing. I wanted to get
into music, so I studied music.
I’ve always wanted to be a
really well—rounded per-
former. I want to make
records where you can go
home and put on the head-
phones, and they actually take
you somewhere.

On what he's learned from
fame:

I never let myself believe
that I was a rock star, even
though I could project that
image very easily in the
videos because performing
comes so naturally. I guess the
main thing I’ve learned is you
can’t take anything with you.
