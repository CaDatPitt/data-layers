Pitt faculty discuss ending of health option

By Sam Gresock
Graphics Assistant

The impending removal of
HealthAmerica as a health care
option at Pitt is still causing a
stir among faculty members.

A proposed multi-year rela-
tionship between Pitt and Blue
Cross could result in the elimi-
nation of HealthAmerica med-

Doctor and
SFL disagree
on abortion
drugs

By Aimee Paquette
For The Pitt News

While Pitt’s Students for Life. _ 

opposes the medical school’s
research on the drugs Cytotec
and Methotrexate for abortion
purposes, Dr. Mitchell D.
Creinin disagrees and
explained the issue of abortion
in the context of ice cream.

“Arguing abortion is like
arguing which flavor of ice
cream is better. If I like choco-
late and you like vanilla, no
one person is more right.”

Creinin, who is an assistant
professor at the University of
Pittsburgh School of Medicine
and the director of Family
Planning and Family Planning
Research at Magee-Women’s
Hospital, began testing the
drugs for abortion back in
1991 at the University of
California at San Francisco.

Presently, he is conducting
his sixth study at the
University of Pittsburgh and
has tested the drugs on 100
women in the Pittsburgh area.

The study, which is also
being conducted at a family
planning facility in Wichita,
Kan., involves the testing of
the drugs on 300 women.
Creinin said although he may
not have initially thought of
the idea of the drugs for abor-
tion purposes, he was the first
to actually conduct a study. ‘

‘‘I may not have been the
first to think of it, but I was the
first to act on it,” he said.

referred through the city, are
required to fill out a ﬁve-page
consent form, and a full expla-

Depression sometimes
a result of holidays

By Linda Wisniewski
Staff Writer

“I start to think there really is no cure for depression, that happi-
ness is an ongoing battle, and I wonder if it isn’t one I’ll have to fight
for as long as I live. I wonder if it’s worth it.”

This quote, taken from the book “Prozac Nation” by Elizabeth
Wurtzel, sums up the emptiness and hopelessness someone battling

clinical depression usually feels.

The book is a story of one woman’s struggle to pull herself from
the constraints of a clinical disorder that affects more than 11 million

people each year.

Feeling “stressed out” or “bummed” during such hectic times as
ﬁnals or the holidays is not unusual, but chronically feeling this way
could be a sign of clinical depression.

Since depression is a medical illness, no amount of “cheering up”

can make it go away.

If left untreated, clinical depression could result in the tragic out-
come of suicide, which is the third-leading cause of death for 15- 24-

“In the last few months there

reestablish a true team of fac-
ulty, staff and administration.”

Carnegie

You’re scheduled to gradu-

enough change in your pockets
to pay for bus fare and, alas,
you just had to close out your
Internet account.

Goodbye to chats with far-
away friends and conversa-

Letterman to herbology -
because most graduates can't
afford the steep costs of buy-

subscribing to an on-line com-
pany. .

But there is a light at the end
of the tunnel. Starting in
January, the Carnegie Library
plans to offer Internet access
free of charge to all Pittsburgh
area residents through the
Three Rivers Freenet. Freenet
can be accessed through home
computers and 10 terminals
installed throughout the main
branch of the Carnegie
Library, although eventually
smaller branch libraries are
expected to receive Freenet
terminals.

Although Freenet allows
Internet access, it is much
more than that.

mation about the government,

It is important to realize that you are

HO CHI MINH CITY.

arrival in Ho Chi Minh City,
Vietnam, the news arrived
that the Welcome Reception
with students from Ho Chi
Minh University was can—
celed. Heartbroken, I swore
to meet some students in my
five—day stay. When we
cleared customs, I stepped
off the ship to a whole new
world. I had no expectation
of Vietnam because everyone
I know who has been to
Vietnam was not there for

sightseeing but to fight a
war.

We were the largest group
of Americans to set foot
here since the war, and I
can’t honestly say the
word “Vietnam” meant
anything else to me but a
war before my visit. As I left
the Port Saigon gate, I was
overwhelmed. I was bom-
barded with men pleading
with me to ride their cyclos,
which are a bicycle with a
seat in the front. With my
mind completely set on the
war, I climbed into one and
asked the driver to take me
to the American War Crimes
Museum. The driver spoke
English remarkably well. He

He asked me if I liked
Vietnamese people. I said
“yes,” even though in the
five minutes I was inthe
country, he was the only per-
son I had met.

I quickly learned the dri-
ving laws of Ho Chi Minh
City, or Saigon as it is still
called by the locals. The
basic rule is that everyone
has the right of way. It’s
quite frightening to be sitting
in the front of a cyclo whose
driver is certain he can cross
in front of a bus.

Riding through the city, the
smell surrounded me. I saw
poverty to a degree I had
never seen before. Little

became so angry and wanted
to tell him they lied, but I
couldn’t. Ijust smiled and
said, “I’m sorry they misun-
derstood our purpose here.”
I encountered so many
people on the streets of
Saigon. Vendors who
grabbed me, cyclo drivers
following me and children
holding onto my shirt, all
wanting money. I must admit
the aggressiveness did get to
me. I snuck into restaurants
and stores to hide many
times, usually in vain. When
I left, the people were all
waiting to sell to Americans,
a group of people they don’t
see very often.
I also saw the sights in

the Saigon area. I took a
boat trip on the Mekong
Delta, about 100

kilometers south of Saigon. I
had the chance to try

dragon fruit, a Vietnamese
fruit. It was delicious. It
went well with the

coconut juice I drank
straight from the coconut.

I also visited the Cu Chi
Tunnels, the tunnel

system used by the Viet
Cong during the “Capitalism
War,” the name of the
Vietnam conflict to the
Vietnamese.

Although these sights

were fascinating, the

people made my visit. The :
last night in Saigon, I, I
along with two other friends,
took our dong," Vietnam’s
currency, and bought
sandwiches for the children
who sell postcards in the
park. I had so much fun

that night with the children.
I even met a friend who
gave me a small stone

 a souvenir. All I had to

give her was a dime.

She loved it. Dimes don’t
spend in Vietnam, but it
was all I had of America to
share.

One of the boys asked me
what time I had to be on
ship. I looked at the clock
and realized I had 15 min-
utes to get on board. We 9
started running. Two cyclo
drivers drove along side of
us. I huffed, “I don’t have
any money!” They replied,
“No money, no problem.
You’ll be late!” We couldn’t
believe our cars. We hopped
on for our final cyclo ride in
a long time. When we
reached the port, I was met
by some students I had met.
All the cyclo drivers were
there, too. It seemed to be a
Grand Farewell. No one tried
to sell me anything, they just
wished good luck to me and
waved me off.

I wondered what happened
to the aggressiveness. I won-
dered what happened to me.
I came with only thoughts of
the war, stayed with some
frustration, and left with a
broken heart. I miss Vietnam
and anxiously wait to return.

MANILA, Philippines — as
scheduled on the morning of
Oct. 14. Some were looking

of us with ties to the war, the

ty awaiting us in Vietnam.
By making these assump-
tions, I underestimated the
impact that my trip to the
Philippines has made on me.
Not necessarily the areas that
I chose to visit or the sites
that I saw, but the attitude of
its people.

The majority of my stay
was spent at a resort where
we swam in hot springs and
hiked in the rain forest.
Groups of three students
piled into canoes and with
the help of our boatmen,
made it through rapids and
waterfalls. Observing the
ﬂora and fauna was incredi-
ble, but it really struck a
chord in me when our tour
guide was asked why had not
really seen any of the
Filipino people, and his
response was that they could
not afford the place where
we were staying. It was then
that I noticed the people who
had been doing their laundry
and fishing in the river
beside us. They were shout-

A ing and waving at us as if
greeting old friends. This
made me realize we were let-
ting our role as tourists over-

shadow these vibrant people.

We started waving back
and convinced our boatmen
to let us stop and talk for a
while. They kept pointing in
excitement to a bunch of
shacks, barely being support-
ed by wooden posts. Ripped
sheets drooped haphazardly
served as both walls and
windows. These were their
homes —— not adequate shel-
ter in the eyes of three
American students, but pos-
sibly the envy of the fami-
lies sleeping in the grassy
area next to where the
Universe was docked. I

sure whether to drop my
money into their hands or
keep moving on as per ad
vice of one of our pre-

port lecturers. He stressed
over and over, saying, “If
you give them a fish, you
feed them for a day; if you
teach them how to fish, you
feed them for a lifetime."

This did not dispel my
feelings of guilt and help-
lessness. On the last day, we
were wandering through the
streets of Manila and
stumbled upon a squatter set-
tlement much like the shacks
lining the river. I started to
walk more briskly, head
down, ashamed to gawk at
the adverse conditions in
which these people lived —
feeling that if the situation
was reversed, I might be
angry at the American girl
traipsing through my home.

I felt a tug on my T-shirt
and looked down into the
eyes of a little girl and her
mother. The mother was
guiding her baby’s hand up
and down, saying hello to
me. She had the most gen-
uine smile I’d ever seen, and
I looked up to see a face that
matched hers.

It made me think of the
material wealth that I saw in
abundance in Hong Kong
and how it did little to wipe
the frowns off the faces of
the business people that I
passed in the street. Here,
where money and what it can
buy does not factor into day-
to-day life, family and faith
are its substitute. The
Filipino people opened my
eyes to the fact that the
American dream may be just
that, and true happiness is
made of simpler stuff.

given to them.

“We want to make certain
their decision is right,” Creinin
said.

The drugs, Methotrexate and
Cytotec, have other medical
purposes besides abortion.
Methotrexate is an anti-
metabolite drug used as an aid
for such illnesses as cancer and
severe cases of asthma, while
Cytotec can be used in preven-
tion of ulcers and gastritis.

For the purpose of abortion,
Methotrexate is given as a shot
to the woman in a low dose.

“It weakens the attachment
to the uterus,” Creinin said.

According to Creinin, the
drug has no long-term effects,
doesn’t affect other pregnan-
cies and doesn’t cause abnor-
mal pregnancies.

A few days after the shot is
administered, the woman
returns and the drug Cytotec,
which is also used with the
RU-486 drug in France, is
issued as a tablet into the vagi-
na. _

“It causes the uterus to
cramp and contract,” Creinin
said.

The entire procedure is done
at home, and when ready, the
uterus expels the pregnancy.
The women must be less than
eight weeks pregnant for this
procedure of abortion.

The student organization,
Students for Life, protests this
testing due to its harmful
effects on women. According
to SfL president Stephanie
Pritchett, one of the risks is
that the woman could bleed to
death.

Creinin said hemorrhaging to
death is possible, yet the prob-
ability of such an occurrence is
less than 1 percent.

“You could hemorrhage with
an abortion just as you could
with a delivery.”

Creinin described the pain
involved in the procedure to
that of a women’s menstrual
period.

“It’s like a bad period. It
varies from person to person.”

The use of the drugs as a
means of abortion varies from
person to person, Creinin said.
Some women will experience
more pain than others.

“Ten women are going to
have 10 different experiences,”
he said.

Although use of the drugs
provides an alternate means of
abortion, Creinin said the drugs
are not necessarily better than a
surgical abortion.

“The surgical abortion works
98 to 99 percent of the time,
whereas the drugs only work
95 percent of the time.”

According to Creinin, the
procedure of abortion that a
woman decides upon is her
choice. An advantage to using
the drugs is providing the
woman with more privacy.

“There is no reason why we
have to make abortion painful
and invasive,” Creinin said.

Another advantage of using
the drugs for abortion purposes

“One thing people must realize
is that depression is curable in up

connected with depression,” said
Bennett. “Very often there is
a correlation between those
two.”

Also, Bennett said, men will

better for weeks, months or even
years.

“There is a chemical imbal-
ance in clinical depression,” said
Bennett. “It’s not a weakness, it’s
not something that can be willed

to 80 percent of all

cases,” said Jason “Alcoholism is also connected with

Penchoff, a net-

sion, it is very hard to turn

things around,” she said.
Bennett said she thinks

Depression.

“This is like breaking your
arm,” he said. “If you break your
arm, you go to a doctor. If you
have depression, you go to a doc-
tor.”

Clinical depression causes per-

, sistent changes in a person’s

mood, feelings and behavior.

Its symptoms
decreased energy, changes in
sleeping patterns, total loss of
interest or pleasure in usual activ-
ities, appetite and weight
changes, inability to concentrate,
thoughts of death or suicide,
excessive crying, restlessness and
chronic_ aches and pains that do
not respond to treatment.

“We see approximately 1,200
students a year,” said Bob
Gallagher, director of Pitt’s coun-
seling center, located in Room
334 of the William Pitt Union.
“About 20 to 25 percent of those
students show some signs of
depression.”

Gallagher said in 1990 and
l992, there was a student-need
survey done on campus.

The results showed that 25 per-
cent of the students surveyed felt
they were depressed enough to
seek help. He said “about five
percent” said they had suicidal
thoughts.

“That’s a lot of people walking
around campus who know they
are depressed enough to see
someone about it,” he said.

Gallagher said it is very helpful D

when friends introduce the
notion that someone is depressed,
because often the person suffer-
ing does not even realize it.

“Very often it helps if friends
can do that,” he said. “It is
important to provide support
because they feel so terribly
alone.”

Tragically, studies show that
15 percent of people with severe,
untreated clinical depression will
kill themselves, according to the
National Alliance for the
Mentally Ill.

“We’ve never had any suicides
on campus,” said Gary Moses,
assistant director of public safety
on campus.

“We’ve had attempted sui-
cides,” he said. “Since the begin-
ning of the semester, we’ve prob-
ably had four attempts.”

Although scientists do not yet
know for certain what causes
depression, some believe that
certain people have a biological
make—up that makes them partic-
ularly vulnerable, since depres-
sion is often found to run in farm-
lies.

“There seems to be a genetic
component,” said Barbara
Bennett, who is licensed in treat-

include"

often let their symptoms of
depression get worse because
they are trained from the time
they are born tobe tough.

“Men don’t do as much shar-
ing and talking as women to even
realize what they are feeling isn’t
normal,” she said. “I think it has
a lot to do with gender training.” ,

Grief and sadness are perfectly
normal and temporary
reactions to life’s unpleasant
events. But someone
suffering from clinical
depression becomes consumed

the best treatment for depres-
sion includes psychotherapy and
some kind of antidepressant
medication.

She said the medication will
clear the head so the person will
have a different outlook on life
and benefit from the therapy
more.

Someone suffering from
depression should consult a resi-
dent assistant, doctor, the coun-
seling center or contact the
National Mental Health
Association at 1-800-969-

would result in savings which,
in turn, would result in reduced
health insurance premium pay-
ments. As a result of a relation-
ship between Pitt and Blue
Cross, the university would
only be allowed to offer Blue
Cross coverage.

The letter also encouraged
eligible Pitt employees consid-
ering enrollment in
HealthAmerica during the
upcoming open enrollment
period to consider that decision
very carefully.

At last month’s Senate
Council meeting, senate mem-
bers expressed concern with
the proposed elimination of
HealthAmerica as well as the
way in which the decision was
made. According to professor
Herb Chesler of the Senate
Committee on Benefits and
Welfare, faculty were not noti-
fied of the proposal before it
was released.

“We were not consulted and
we played no role in it,”
Chesler said. “The Benefits

and Welfare Committee was
not informed about the propos-
al from Blue Cross to have the
university enter into a multi-
year relationship, provided that
Blue Cross was the exclusive
vendor of our health insur-
ance.”

Chesler said he has sent a
memorandum to several mem-
bers of theyuniversity adminis-
tration regarding the commit-
tee’s concern with the pro-
posed change in medical insur-
ance options.

“”We went on record
expressing our concerns with
[the] process as well as the 
implications for the future of
this proposal.”

Professor Philip Wion of the
Senate Budget Policies
Committee urged faculty mem-
bers involved in Senate

concerns with the health care
proposal. »

of Carnegie Library, described
the Freenet as “an electronic
underground newspaper. It is
local in focus and is aimed at
sharing information from com-
munity organizations into the
region.”

He said it is “a people’s
press” intended for sharing
information and not a commer-
cial venture. Cronenberger also
said he hopes the Freenet will

reach a wide range of people
' from different economic and
educational backgrounds.

“It’s not just for the home
computer person, that’s why
we want access availability in
all the libraries, for instance, in
the county,” he said.

Partially funded by federal
grants and a Library Services
and Construction Act grant,
Freenet is largely a volunteer
operation assisted by students
from Pitt’s School of Library
and Information Science with
some information science stu-
dents helping with the techni-
cal aspects. Eventually, Black
said she hopes there will be a
helpline established for
Freenet users staffed with vol-
unteers.

Pittsburgh will join a very
limited number of cities that is
deprivatizing Internet services
by offering Freenet to the gen-
eral public. Cleveland’s
Freenet is the model that
seems to be looked to in ‘deter-
mining demand and what to
expect in this experimental
new project.

“We know that with other
Freenets there’s been much
more demand that they’ve
been able to meet at all com-
fortably. It’s very hard to get
onto the Cleveland Freenet,
they’re always busy. We’ll try
to meet it when we find out
what the demand is,” said
Black.

Chris Tomer, assistant pro-
fessor of library science at Pitt,
has worked at Case Western
Reserve University on
Cleveland’s Freenet and has
been very inﬂuential in push-
ing for a Pittsburgh Freenet.
Tomer said this is the first
Freenet system sponsored by a
major public library, and Pitt
“is the first university like this
to play an active role.”

Tomer also co—wrote the fed-
eral grant that provided fund-
ing for Freenet and has
arranged for many SLIS stu-
dents to volunteer their time
helping to set up Freenet.

“I believe that Internet
access should be an entitle-
ment,” said Tomer.

Working on making Freenet
a reality since 1990, Tomer
said he has strong opinions
about Internet accessibility,
privatizing the Internet and the
possibility of the Internet
becoming increasingly com-
mercial. Tomer said “right
now, upper—middle class and
university students are the pri-
mary beneficiaries [of the
Intemet].”

Tomer applauded such
efforts as Cleveland’s Case
Western Academy, which con-
nected its students to peers all
over the world through the
Internet.

“Our primary purpose with
the Freenet is to make a real
difference here in the region,”
said Chris Tomer.

Black agreed and said
Freenet “tends to equalize
things and eliminate the gap
between those who have
[Internet] access and those
who don’t.”

Black said the Carnegie
Library considers the Freenet
“as an extension of library ser-
vices. It’s our purpose to offer
information. We see it more as
a provision of information than
a provision of Internet access.”

Black said she thinks the
whole community can profit
from Freenet, “but at the same
time we want to make it possi-
ble for some folks, who don’t
have any way of getting to it,
to get onto the Internet and see
what’s there.”

Cronenberger said the
Carnegie is holding training
classes at the library and plans
to provide computers to public
housing communities.~.Training
classes will be given in hous-
ing projects in apartments ren-
ovated into computer labs as
part of the Literacy and
Learning program.
Cronenberger said he hopes tc
eventually establish public
kiosks for maximum availabil-
ity to the Freenet for
Pittsburghers if the demand is
there.

“The success of the Freenet
depends on the users,” said
Cronenberger.

So, for Pitt students, Black.
an alumnus of Pitt, said, “It
will be good to know that
when they graduate and get
their Pitt accounts closed out
on them that they’ll have a
place to go.”

“This will make abortior
more accessible,” he said.

Students for Life’s goal this
semester is to stop the testing
of the drugs for abortion pur-
poses. They have had speakers
talk on the subject, workshop:
and have passed “out leaﬂets at
the medical school in order tc
get their message out.

Creinin said he respects the
students’ opinion, but it is jus

Wion said.

Holland said the health cov-

in the near future. He said he
has already received nearly 30

“I promise you this issue is

World's future is?

Oh where, oh where is our world heading? That is what 52
nations were attempting to determine in a European conference,
and the news is not good. The summit was designed to strength-
en security in Europe but was disrupted by Russia’s opposition
to the expansion of NATO and Bosnia’s recriminations about the
world’s anemic efforts to halt the war in the former Yugoslavia.

Boris Yeltsin claimed that NATO is trying to split Europe by
admitting members of the former Warsaw Pact, i.e. splitting
Europe by leaving Russia out in the cold. Yeltsin also derided
the United States as domineering and trying to control NATO
and the world, saying, “History demonstrates that it is a danger-
ous illusion to suppose that the destinies of continents and of the
world community in general can somehow be managed from
one single capital.”

Of course, we must question Yeltsin’s assertion in light of the

United States’ inability to assert its will over the Bosnian ques-
tion —— generally being ineffective rather than domineering. But
regardless of the accuracy of Yeltsin’s claims, they are indica-
tive of how far apart the world’s major nations are from formu-
lating any sort of collective strategy for foreign relations and a
peaceful world. Bringing ominous memories of the cold war,
Yeltsin said, “Europe is in danger of plunging into a cold
peace.”
‘ Yeltsin was not the only one to deride the Western powers,
though. Alija Izetbegovic, president of Bosnia-Herzegovina,
held nothing back in his scathing commentary on the West, say-
ing, “What shall be the result of the war in Bosnia which is now.
being prolonged due to a mixture of incapability, hesitation and
sometimes even ill will of the West? The result shall be a dis-
credited United Nations, a ruined NATO, Europeans demoral-
ized by a feeling of inability to respond to the first crisis after
the cold war.”

But the word from Europe is not all gloom and doom.
Ironically, while Izetbegovic was making his harsh statements,
the leaders of the United States, Britain, Russia and France were
attending a ceremony wherein they pledged security assurances
in exchange for Ukraine becoming a non-nuclear power. This
agreement paves the way for implementation of START I
(Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty), and will hopefully lead to
the ratification of START II. If both of these treaties are imple-
mented, the world’s nuclear arsenals will be reduced by two-
thirds.

So where does this leave the future of the world? We feel it is
important to remember that we are in a much better situation
today than we were 10 years ago. But the initial euphoria of the
end of the cold war has long worn off and a “new world order”
is not being established. Where we go from here cannot be
determined. However, what is clear is that the U.S. must make a
decision as to what its place will be in the world. At this point, it
is increasingly clear that no one knows where that place is or
what it will be.

Scientists must consider ethics

uppose you wanted to
S move a herd of cattle in

a container the size of a
rabbit. How would you do it?
It is possible, rather easy actu-
ally. Before answering this
question, however, let’s take a
look at the technology that
makes it possible.

Genetic engineering is a
rapidly growing field which
will soon affect our lives in
ways we’ve not yet consid-
ered. (No,‘the answer is not to
breed smaller cows. Who
wants burgers that look like
they come from a rat?) Gene
therapy is offering hope for
people with diseases such as
cystic fibrosis where diagnosis
formerly meant a death sen-
tence. It is also promising in
the treatment of cancer and
hope for controlling AIDS.

As part of the University
Honors College lecture series,
Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor set forth some of
these possibilities in a lecture
entitled “Genes, Flies and
Libraries.” The power of this
technology is awesome. At the
same time, so are the ethical
dilemmas it poses. These last
considerations are what
formed the meat of the discus-
sion at the lecture’s close.

Some of the more commonly
expressed concerns about this
kind of work are not the real
threats. For example, the pos-
sibility of someone actually
constructing a race of super-
men as some Nazi might do, is
extremely remote. To create a
whole genome, including all
the traits necessary (intelli-
gence, being a good shot,
longevity, etc.) would be a
monumental undertaking last-
ing more than a lifetime. It
also brings up the entire nature
vs. nurture question. Is it more
important to be born with good
genes or to be raised in an
environment where you can
make the most of the potential
you have?

What is important to recog-
nize is that human beings are
the result of thousands of years
of evolution and natural selec-
tion. The people alive today
are obviously well-designed to
have come this far. Now the
question becomes whether
anyone ought to attempt to
make even small changes in
this design.

Genetic engineering is not
the only area where this ques-
tion must be considered. All of
medical science must think of
it. Correction of some genetic
disorders may not be the best
route over the long haul. For
example: sickle-cell anemia is
a disease which affects one out
of about 400 blacks. While
wiping out this gene may seem
like a good idea, having one
copy of the gene provides “a
resistance to malaria. It is only
when a person has two copies
of the gene that he manifests
the disease.

To digress slightly into the
larger realm, another consider-
ation is the fact that better
medical science allows people
to live longer. This includes
people who would not normal-
ly be able to have children..
Should these people be pre-
vented from having children,
thus preventing the continua-
tion of some of the more viru-
lent genetic diseases?

What about people who
know they are carriers for
genetic diseases? For instance,
there was a woman who knew
she was a carrier for an inherit-
ed forrn of mental. retardation.
She was offered prenatal test-

_ing for the gene and said she

would abort any fetus who was
affected by or carrying the dis-
ease. Another case involves a
couple who had a child infect-
ed with cystic fibrosis and
wanted to know their chances
of having a healthy child. It
turned out that only the mother
had a gene for cystic fibrosis
and not the father. This

showed that he was not the
biological father of the child
—— yet he thought he was.

Both of these cases’ are true
and were reported in the Nov.
5 issue of Science News.
Whether this sort ‘of informa-
tion should be given to the
people in question is a thorny
issue. Will people be allowed
to select certain traits, such as
the sex of their children?
While the whole genome may
not be determinable, certain
characteristics are.

To get back to the rabbit
question, we need to leave the
realm of human genetics. Most
people know that plants and
animals are selectively cross-
bred to create better farm ani-
mals and crops,

Can genetic breeds be
patented? Should a farmer
have exclusive right to his
breed of Holstein? The same
questions arise in terms of
plants. If one crop is superior
to others, should other species
be abandoned in favor of that
one?

Genetic diversity is much
more important than cultural
diversity. In the 1970s, corn
crops suffered from a devastat-
ing fungal infection. Total corn
production was reduced by 15
percent. Diversity protects the
whole, if not all of the individ-
uals. In addition, maintaining
diversity allows for a greater
number of traits in developing
new strains.

So, to move a herd of cattle

in a rabbit, you would implant 4

the fertilized cow eggs in a
rabbit, move it to the desired
location, and re-implant the
eggsinto cows. This way, new
breeds of animals can be taken
to parts of the world where
increased agricultural produc-
tion is necessary. So the adage
that great things come in small
packages is especially true in
genetics. A

The Pitt News, Wednesday, December 7, 1994

Time to stop bashing Justice Clarence Thomas

pponents of
J u s t i c e
Clarence

Thomas are once
again on the attack as
a recent book and the
 liberal media rally
Columnist around Anita Hill by
T01] spinning another web
DIC ensheets of unsubstantiated
rumors. The book,
“Strange Justice: The Selling of
Clarence Thomas,” was written by
Wall Street Journal reporters Jane
Mayer and Jill Abramson and was
widely embraced by the leftist media
and was nominated for a National
Book Award before it was even
released to the public last month.

Since then the media has been on a
frenzy of Thomas-bashing by giving
exhaustive coverage of “Strange
Justice” and once again questioning
whether Clarence Thomas told the truth
during the Senate Judiciary Committee
hearings in the fall of 1991. On Nov. 2,
the TV news magazine “Turning Point”
with Barbara Walters interviewed sev-
eral women who had worked with
Thomas at the EEOC and claimed that
they were sexually harassed by him
during that time. (He later fired two of
them for their job performance.)
Despite the fact that theseswomen were
said to have new “evidence” that

    

Thomas lied three years ago, the only
thing new that came out of either
“Strange Justice” or “Turning Point”
was that one of the women went to
Thomas’ residence and made the earth-
shattering discovery that he had several
copies of Playboy lying around his
apartment.

This, according to the women in the
interview, makes Thomas a man
obsessed with pornography. There are
two glaring problems with a premise
such as this. The first is that Playboy is
not pornographic since it does not
exploit women. They are photographed
at their own will and are paid nicely for
their work. They are all adults and
while they are obviously nude, they are
tastefully posed with no scenes of
bondage of women or submission.

Second, literally millions of men read
Playboy on a monthly basis, and I’ve
yet to hear anybody misguided enough
to call all of them pornographic mani-
acs. And by the way, what do these
accusers call women who read
Playgirl?

These women and the ultra-feminists
who support them could care less about
truly advancing the cause of women.
They care only about their own left-
wing agenda, and it is for this reason
that they fear Thomas and are trying to
destroy his credibility. The ultra-femi-
nists have joined with the liberal wing

of the civil rights community to assail
Thomas as a traitor to his race in par-
ticular and to the mainstream civil
rights movement in general. Thomas
has been called an Uncle Tom by liber-
al blacks because they see him as a per-
son who has “sold out” to the white
“Establishment” for personal gain. His
detractors cite his opposition to affir-
mative action and the redrawing of
Congressional districts in favor of
minority candidates as proof that he
has betrayed his black heritage. That
means that these so—called black lead-
ers believe that blacks are historically
meant to live in slums in the inner
cities and be uneducated. Shame on
these people, for they are the ones who
have betrayed blacks by telling them
that they can’t succeed because of
some invisible form of racism.
Clarence Thomas doesn’t buy this
nonsense, and it is for this reason that
he so threatens the ultra-liberals and
their livelihoods of living off the mis-
fortune of others. Thomas comes from
a poor family, and he quietly worked
his way up the ladder until he was
named to the Supreme Court by
President Bush in 1991. Since that
time, he has been reviled by those on
the Far Left. As a black conservative,
Thomas should be held up asa role
model for his community. He teaches
by example that minorities need not be

victims and that through hard work
they can accomplish their goals.

This is tough for the counterculture
leftists to take, especially for the ones
who continue to lead the black commu-
nity. Added to the misery of those on
the Left is the fact that the black con-
servative movement continues to grow.
This group of people know that reverse
discrimination and quota systems will
only hurt race relations, not help them.
This is why the liberal elites, with the
help of the media, have ganged up on
Clarence Thomas.

To understand the bias of the media,
one need only look at how they have
covered the various books that have
dealt with the Thomas—Hill saga. While
there were several TV shows and mas-
sive media coverage of “Strange
Justice,” most of the press has conve-
niently forgotten to cover
“Resurrection: The Confirmation of
Clarence Thomas” by Sen. John
Danforth. This book supports Thomas
and refutes many of the rumors about
the personal life of the Justice. Despite
the best efforts by the character assas-
sins and the media to discredit Thomas,
in the end they have only managed to
discredit themselves and their warped
cause.

Sexism

I was extremely disappoint-
ed to read a theater review in
the Dec. 1 issue of The Pitt
News by Kate Scholl. I have
always been impressed in the
past with the level ofjudge—
ment and responsibility exer-
cised by this paper. however
this article was very disturb-
ing. In her review of the per-

formance. she makes a com- -

ment about one of the histori-
cal figures, “Brutal rapes and
lethal beatings were Gomez’s
speciality for no other reason
than being in a position of
power -— a characteristic of
men."

Unlike Kate Scholl, I am not
naive enough to believe that
abuse of power is a gender-
dependant behavior. The
informed individual need look

no further then recent events '

to understand that women are
as capable as men of abusing
power for their own uses. Men
are increasingly filing sexual
discrimination and harassment
charges against women. While
this may not be comforting, it
is undeniably true.

Miss Scholl. sexism is a
two-way street. Your remarks
were not an insightful social
revelation, as you may have
thought at the time. but in the
world of reality they are sex-
ist. Sexism is just as ugly and
inappropriate when directed at
men as it is directed toward
women. In either case, it is not
responsible journalism. Your
comments demean and
defame males no differently
than any gender directed slur
toward women.

Perhaps you wrote those
remarks without thinking
about their impact. If so, grow
up. Perhaps you have some

deep—seated resentment
toward men. If that is your
problem, see a therapist.
Either way, have some respect

‘for men and the integrity of

The Pitt News, and leave the
sexist comments at your type-

Underage drinking

I am writing in response to
your recent stories about
underage drinking on campus.
Once again The Pitt News has
compromised the interests of
students to pursue a third-rate
tabloid story. Yes the interests
of students. We all work very
hard at this university and
indeed enjoy unwinding with
one another over a drink.

Please do not try to defend
yourselves by saying,
“Underage drinking is ille-
gal.” Moral or ethical itera-
tions from a publication which
prints the name of a rape vic-
tim is meaningless to me.
Kevin Kramer has earned the
disdain of students, and The
Pitt News has earned our dis-
trust once again.

Your series is cheap and
self—righteous. I am of age and
can sit in any tavern I please.
But I enjoy doing so with my
friends who are not of age and
subject to Pennsylvania’s mis-
guided drinking laws. Like the
majority of Pitt students, we
do not drink ourselves to life-
threatening degrees and do not
roam Oakland violent and
intoxicated. To do so would
earn a ticket out of the bar
which is more than can be
said of private parties. The
absence of drunk driving
around campus is a self-

explanatory point.

The Pitt News has betrayed
their advertising customers
and has had the audacity to
insinuate that Pitt students
should be arrested. Perhaps it
is time to make CMU’s paper
available on our campus. As
for Kevin Kramer, go home to
New York and don’t come
back. It’s bad enough that The
Pitt News will remain.

Drinking safely

Today when I read your
article about underage drink-
ing I was impressed with the
means used to investigate the
problems with drinking in the
local bars. However, I do not
view underage drinking at the
bars as a serious problem. A

quote from one of the repre-

sentatives from Zelda’s should
be considered when you write
articles about underage drink-
ing because this series of
reporting will reduce the num-
ber of students being served at
the bars. “Is it worse to let
underage students in, or turn
them away and let those who
drive get into cars and drive to
area bars that will let them in,
only to know that they will
have to drive back to Oakland,
probably drunk?” This state-
ment means a lot to me
because I had a friend die
under the exact circumstances
as illustrated by a Zelda’s rep-
resentative.

My home is in a
Philadelphia suburb where it
is difficult to obtain alcohol,
specifically beer, in area dis-
tributors and bars. A number
of my friends wanted to go
out one night and enjoy each
others’ company while drink-

ing some alcoholic beverages.
Since they couldn’t buy alco-
hol from local distributors and
sneak it into somebody’s
house, they decided to meet in
a bar in Philadelphia where
they could easily get served.
One of my friends who drove
into town to go to the bar died
later that night on the drive
home. This death could have
been avoided if he was
allowed to walk to one of the
neighborhood bars and avoid
driving by walking home later
that night.

I don’t know if the purpose
of your three day series of
articles is to put pressure on
the bars, but perhaps you
should write something about
the benefits of drinking in a
bar rather than at a party off
campus. Safety is the best rea-

son “to support?’ underage is

drinking at bars because they
are close enough to the cam-
pus where students don’t have
to drive to get them. Ideally,
violent crimes should be
reduced when drinking at the

bars, because they are close ,

enough to the campus where
students don’t have to drive to
get to them. Ideally, violent
crimes should be reduced
when drinking at the bars in
Oakland because of the num-
ber of policemen on Forbes
Avenue. Between the National
Guard parked outside of the
“O,” and the larger than life
bouncers in the bars, fewer
fights will break out at bars
and on the streets than at off
campus parties. Also, since
the bars are within blocks of
the majority of dormitories in
Schenley Quadrangle, chances
of a rape occurring on Forbes
Avenue is much lower than on
the long walk home from the

fraternities on the hill and on
Dithridge Street.

At a bar alcohol consump-
tion is reduced because of the
price of drinks and, at most
places, the drinks are watered
down. At a party students will
pay $2 to $5 to drink all the
beer they want and drink
punch where you don’t know
how much alcohol is dumped
in it. At a bar where you pay
$1.50 for a Budweiser.

‘Students aren’t going to drink

as much because the costs add
up and a trip to a bar will be
an occasional expense, unlike
a $2 party that can become
habitual because most stu-
dents can afford that for a
night out.

In the bars drinking isn’t as
glorified as it is at parties
where people are encouraged
to do keg stands, funnel beer
and_have chugging contests.
Drinking becomes more of a
social event where students
can have fun and release pres-
sures from the school week.

I am not trying to knock the
fraternity system or off cam-
pus parties at all, because they
have proven to be a positive
experience for college stu-
dents over many decades, with
the exception for occasional
incidents. I just want to show
my support for the Oakland
bars because they provide a
good time for all students (of
age and minors) in a closed.
protected environment. Since
underage drinking will contin-
ue to be practiced everywhere.
let’s not exploit the loopholes
in the bar system but instead
spend more time on teaching
students of all ages to drink
responsibly.

The clock read 6:15 a.m., senior Matt
Brady, Pitt’s star swimmer, was wide
awake in a happy mood ready to go up
to Trees Hall for the first practice of the
day.

At the men’s practice, they were
already in the pool.

They had been swimming since 6:30
a.m. The team did a very intense work-
out, swimming back and forth, back
and forth until 8:30 a.m., with a few
breaks that lasted only a couple of min-
utes each.

During their
breaks, the guys
would joke around
with each other.
They didn’t seem
to mind that they
were awake that
early in the morn-
ing while the majority of college stu-
dents were sound asleep in their beds.

Halfway through the practice, the
sprinters left to go lift weights, and the
distance swimmers kept swimming
until practice was over.

Brady and the distance swimmers did
lap after lap in the pool, strengthening
their arms and legs.

After practice, Brady and two team-

mates stayed in the pool and just joked
around while swimming up and down
the pool.

Two of his teammates thought they
would play a little joke on their friend.
While he was swimming, they took a
cooler of cold water and dumped it on
him.

Brady is usually one of the first ones
in the pool, so to wake everyone else up
he splashes them. The cold water was
their way of getting him back.

I waited for Brady after practice and
drove him home. When asked if he was
going to go back to sleep until his class
at 10 a.m., he just shook his head.

With his tight schedule of classes,
practices and studying, naps‘ are a rarity
for him.

If he does have time for one it’s a
maximum 15 minute nap, and on the

way to his 10 a.m. class he’ll grab a
bagel from Schwartz’s.

Brady wanted me to go to practice
with him in the morning so I could get
a better idea of what the team feels like
every day when they have practice at 6
a.m. and 3 p.m., go to classes all day
and have to study at the end of an
exhausting day.

“Getting up doesn’t bother me, it’s
the workouts that make me tired
because they are so intense. I start get-
ting tired in shifts. Around 10:30 and
two it hits me.”

With all the time Brady spends prac-
ticing and competing, he doesn’t have
much time for anything else. Brady
snickered when he said he would love
to be a “regular college student.”

Women '5 wrestling is not a gimmick

Staff Writer

The dim lights and thick smell
of musty air can be overcoming
when walking through the door-
way of the small rectangular
room. Below pictures of people
performing karate, and in
between two ballet bars lies
four, worn, red wrestling mats.

Seeing two people wrestling
on them might not be surprising
—— that is, if it were two men.

No, this is not Gorgeous
Ladies of Wrestling league, it’s
a real women’s wrestling club.

John Gizler, owner of East
Coast Women’s Wrestling, has
been handing out ﬂyers, recruit-
ing athletes from different sports
in their offseason time and any-
thing else he can think of to let
people know that his women’s
wrestling club is not a joke.

“It’s not Jell-O or mud
wrestling, it’s all real —— nothing
fake,” said Gizler.

ECWW is affiliated with
USA Wrestling, which is the
national governing body for the
sport of wrestling in the United

States. USA Wrestling is _a rep-

they lose. There are also schol-

“It’s not Jell-O or mud wrestling, it’s all

real — nothing fake.”

— John Gizler, owner of East Coast

Women’s Wrestling on his organization .

“The other countries that par-
ticipate in the Olympics said
that if we don’t start sending
women wrestling competitors,
then we shouldn’t come at all,”
said Gizler.

“The problem I have is that a
lot of people want to see it ﬁrst.
and then they say. ‘I can't do
it,”’ said Gizler.

Prospective wrestlers are
taught step-by-step all of the
holds and escapes during the
first three weeks of practice and
are then given the option to

arships given out ranging from
$25 to $1,200 a semester for
any type of student who partici-
pates.

ECWW has a total of 30
wrestlers, and of those 30, six
are Pitt students.

“A friend gave me one of the
flyers because she thought this
is the kind of thing I’d do.” said
Pitt student J emiifer Krayuo.

“I decided to do it to make
money, have some fun and for
the competition.”

Julie Orth just wants money

to go snowboarding. Orth, a 21-
year-old student of Duff’s
Business Institute, read about
ECWW in The Permysaver.

“I was interested in the
money. It’s better than being a
waitress,” said Orth. After a
month of training, Orth will be
competing in her first competi-
tion in a week.

Since wrestling is mainly a
men’s sport, high schools and
middle schools don’t offer a
women’s team, said Gizler.
Women can join the men’s
team, but the other opponent
usually forfeits. he added.

“If you think you can [wres-
tle], then why not just do it
instead of letting society put yo
down?” said Gizler. -

Gizler eventually wants to be
able to go into high schools and
middle schools and create clubs
there. He would optimally like
to sponsor some of the women
in the Olympics (ECWW will
pay to go to the trials) and hire
60 to 70 competitors to teach in
the Pittsburgh area.

Mahoney’s ship is sure to
weather the Big Beast’s
storm.

On Monday, the Three
freshman tasted their first
sip of the conference’s com-
petition against Pitt, at a
loosely packed Civic Arena.

Their first experience was
a suitable one: an 88-83
victory, lifting the St.
John’s Freshmen (is that
politically correct?) to a 5-0
start.

The prophet of the trio,
Felipe Lopez, a 6—foot—5-

Having already received
unworldly recognition,
Lopez proved that his

Mixing this with the pressure
of performing for his team,
coach and the university is
what keeps him from being a

more recognition, but we
don’t swim for press cover-
age. We swim for ourselves
because we love the sport

This would give them a
better idea of how good the
sports are at this university.
Brady emphasized how the

“It would be nice if we got more recognition, but we don’t

swim for press coverage. We swim for ourselves because we love

the sport and the competition. It would be nice for people who

put in long hours to get some attention because not everyone is

on scholarship.”

s— Pitt swimmer Matt Brady

“normal college student.”

“I love the sport, the com-
petition and the team envi-
ronment. I couldn’t be a
swimmer if I had to do it by
myself; we [the team] help
each other.”

Brady wasn’t discouraged
by the fact that the team
doesn’t get more notoriety.

“It would be nice if we got

and the competition. It
would be nice for people
who put in long hours to
get some attention because

ship.”

He felt if the so-called
“non-revenue sports” got
more attention, this would
bring more students to the
competitions.

team really helps him get
through the tough. times.

“We look out for each
other. It’s a support system,
we make sure we’re all
studying.”

The men start practicing in
September and end in March.
If he makes it to the champi-
onships, which he did last
year, his season isn’t over

until the very end of March,
giving him only three to
three-and-‘a-half weeks with
no training.

He goes in on Sundays to
practice, because with his
schedule he misses practice
on Wednesdays.

With the love and dedica-
tion for the sport, Brady has
proven himself to be one of
the best swimmers in Pitt
history by breaking
numerous records.

This year he has already
broken three school records
in the 500 yard freestyle,
1,000 free and the 1,650
free, along with a couple of
pool records at different
schools.

This past weekend he
broke his previous record
(l5:28.6) in the 1,650 free
with a new time of 15:28.
The season has just begun,
so he still has the rest of it to
accomplish his goal of going
to the NCAA Championships
and placing high.

learning what the college

Come on coach, they’re
