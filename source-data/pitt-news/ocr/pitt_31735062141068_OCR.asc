Delta Phi Epsilon, Camera
Unit Sell Stamps Today

When the Delta Phi Epsilon fra-
ternity takes over the battleship
booth today to sell defense stamps,
they will be competing against a
record of a gain in sales each week.

Since the opening of the cam-
paign ﬁve weeks ago, each suc-
ceeding total sales amount has
been beaten. Last week’: sales of
defense bonds and stamps totaled
$1,222.25, with $900 of stamps
sold to the Military ball commit-
tee.

Pearl Harbor will be the theme
of today’s stamp sales, with the
women of Delta Phi Epsilon aided
in selling by members of the Cam-
era Arts unit and members of the
sales staff of the committee.

Robert L. Arthur, faculty ad-
viser to the defense stamp commit-
tee, will aid in the new faculty
drive.

Each faculty member will be
reached by mail next week as an
attempt to obtain faculty participa-
tion in the purchasing of stamps

and bonds.

The committee will concentrate
on a program of total faculty par-
ticipation rather than individual

The University is training men
for metallurgical work in war in-

inspection laboratory in State Hall.
Acquired a year ago, and convert-
ed from a post-oﬂice room, the
laboratory has gradually been mod-
ernized by the addition of the new-

Morning and evening classes are
conducted to prepare men for
work in army and navy ordnance
divisions and to instruct workers
already employed in industry in
the latest practices. "

The classes are instructed in the
treatment of metals to increase
their hardness, tensile strength,
and durability, and for the test-

Launch Plans

For Elections T

By s. 1-‘. AYERS

One week from today, April 1,
students will go to the polls to vote
in one of the strangest elections
ever conducted at Pitt.

Only one series of slates will be
on the ballot——the fraternity, and
candidates who will pass out slate
cards only will be those with fra-
ternity pins on their vests.

But Independents will be station-
ed in front of Soldiers’ and Sailors’
Memorial hall, passing out liter-
ature for the equal representation
plebiscite, for a 16-16 ratio for fra-
ternity and non-fraternity students
in the Student-Faculty association.
The largest number of seats the
Independents ever received was 14
in 1937.

This year because of the accel-
erated program and “because non-
fraternity students comprise the
majority of students at Pitt," the
lndependents have “sacriﬁced"
their slates to throw all their
weight for equal representation.
Rumors have indicated that the

Independents again are struggling
this year to organize a compact
group, but fraternities are not hav-
ing an easy time. 2

Unconﬁrmed reports from fra-
ternity meetings carry tales of ar-
guments and dissension, and com-

Independents To

Campaign For
"Equal Rights"

By ABE BLUESTONE

An intensive drive to get the
equal representation amendment
through at the elections next week
will keynote Independent party
campaigning this year.

Independent leaders, declaring
they intend to take off the kid
gloves, announced that speeches
by independents—-and any frater-
nity men who are willing——will be
given every day at noonin the
Men's Tuck shop and in C24 Ca-
thedral. Speakers selected so far
are Hiram Milton, C42; Aldo Icar-
di, C43; Albert Briney, C43, and
Richard Briney, C45.

Joseph Kelley, E42, independent
party leader among students in the
Schools of Engineering and Mines,
has anouced that a mass meeting
will be conducted for students on
the Hill.«

The equal representation amend-
ment, around which the independ-
ents are centering their campaign,
provides that both the fraternities
and the independents would have
16 members each in SFA, the win-
ners being the first 16 in each
group receiving the highest num-
ber of votes. If the amendment
goes through, it will be effective
for the coming termg.

of Hitler, Mussolini, and the Japanese militarists have pro-
; claimed that the war is a revolution to establish a new order.
‘This declaration is a propaganda device. to mask sinister de-
signs of conquest and exploitation. But it is successful in large
measure because peoples everywhere feel a real need for a
I new order. '

One aspect of the Axis aims is shared by most of its
_ Ajenemies. This is the belief that Europe must be uniﬁed, and
its resources rationally developed, and that the raw mate-
wfrials of the world must ‘no longer be-exploited by capitalist
_ imperialism of the old type. »

 . People and Mnlitarigsm ,
i " The common people of Britain, of France and the United
States do not, any more than those of Germany, wish to pre-
serve the manifest evils of “their own domestic systems which
Hitler challenged. No soldier in the armies opposed to Hitler,
, y, no oppressed victim of his might, will sacriﬁce his life to restore
’ J‘ 1929 or 1932. ' ,.

 The trouble with Hitler’s new order is not that it differs
* from the old, but that it substitutes naked military imperial-‘
-ism and the totalitarian police state for the somewhat more
 gentle form of economic imperialism, and that it is imposed
.-for the beneﬁt of a German “master race.” The peoples of the
3 world will not endure this type of “order” or the “revolution”
which brings it into being.

just how to organize what they want, and see mainly that Hit-
ler’s power must be smashed before they can get it. But not
for a moment must it be supposed thatafter the ﬁghting is
ﬁnished they will be satisﬁed with anything less "fI'\'§“n a new
order of their own. This war cannot even be won without a
«revolution against Hitlerism. ‘And such a. revolution will never
repose power in new Baldwins, Chamberlains, Daladiers,
Hardings or Hoovers.

. Wiorld War II: Revolution ,
I ' The Second World War is, as so many have said, already

a revolution. The real issue has become, what set of forces

is to come out of it with the revolutionary power. Whoever
"twins, the certain losers are the pre-war conservatives. It is

vague sense of this fact thatled some conservatives in the
A United States to make a futile effort to keep this country
“punsullied by contact with the convulsion.

I‘ Those who pursued this course would be shrewder and
could face the inevitable changes with less discomfort to them-
selves if, like the British conservatives, they would, having ac-
cepted the common cause against Hitlerism, be prepared to
make concessions to a new democratic order.

Another important point about the aims of the present
war-——and one in which it equally differs from the former
‘conﬂict—-——is that the aims are being developed in progress.

was an emergency measure only, and that the new order, what-
ever it was to be, would be cut out of whole cloth and put 9n

vestiturev was in some magic way to be combined with a return

mark of 5.9 seconds.

Another record was set last year
when Doyle “Dusty” Rhoades pole»
vaulted 13 feet 6 inches. While not
a sensational mark when compared
with that of Cornelius Warmerdam,
the California flash, it is neverthe-
less a record not to be taken too
lightly. Also, Rhoades has the
beneﬁt of another year of experi-
ence and probably will be able to
set a new Pitt record.

exhibition of the day asbothﬂteams
displayed mid-season form.

Dick Fair sent the PiKA nine‘
off to a lead when he tripled with
two men on base early in the

-game. The contest was then as
good as over for the Pi Lams for
only Marty Faberman and Jerry

arm Joe Siano for base clouts.
‘The Phi» Delts provided some-

what of a minor upset» when they

"The Phi Delts took advantage.

was typical of an opening day bat-

marring the play.

the day, Sigma Chi crushed Theta

Only man now competing to libld
more than one record is “Bullet
Bill” Carter. The Negro ace has the

,50-yard dash_and thebroad jump

to his credit, and like Stickel and
Rhoades is an excellent chance to
set new marks in the two events.
According to track coach Carl
Olson two freshmen marks are in
danger of being erased. First year
pole vaulter Paul Fisher has shown
sufficient form to warrant a good
chance to hang up a new record;
while Bill Omelia, freshman shot
putter, should be able to establish
a better mark for this event.
Frank Ohl is the only other rec-
ord-holder to have more than one
mark to his credit. Ohl, who gradu-
ated in 1940, holds-the two lap
dash record of 33 seconds and the
running broad jump ‘mark of 23
feet, 51/2 inches.

For N

Riﬂes; association tournament

Comprising the Gold and Blue roster are: rifllers Law-
rence La Spada, Bruno Cengia, John Helbliﬂg. William Shuck,
Robert Bennett, and Gerald Haywood; manager Richard
’ Stein; coaches Lieutenant Havlack and Sergeant McDonald.

Last year the Panthers ﬁred in

Washington, D. C., placing ninth_

in their section andgthirteenth in
the nation. Considering that prac-
tically every college_ participates in
this annual affair, the showing of
the Pitt marksmen was very good.

However, the brightest spot of
last -year's outcome was the ex-
cellent ﬁring of Larry La Spada,
veteran and captain of the present
aggregation, who placed eleventh
in the ﬁnal individual national bal-
loting and just missed making the
official all-American Riﬂe team-—
ten best riﬂers inthel country.

A trophy, a certiﬁcate of victory,
and seven silver ‘medals will be
awarded to the intercollegiate
championship team, and each sec-
tional winner will receive seven
bronze medals. To the highest-scoiw
ing individual in the nation will go
a gold-ﬁlled award and a certiﬁcate
of victory, to the second highest
a silver award, and to each of tthe,
following eight 2. bronze award.

Last, but not least, these ten top
men represent the “Colden Bul-
lets,” the all-American riﬂe team.
Due to the Panthers’ inconsist-
ency during the past eight series
of postal matches, your reporter
does not dare predict any outcome.

Dr. Charles Glen King, professor

‘Nutrition foundation, incorporated,
but he will continue to conduct his
classes and do research work at
the University. 4

Developing and applying the

pose of this joint project of six-
teen food companies who have
4 subscribed $800,000.

The program is designed to last

president. , '

DP. King, of international repu-

The idea of nationality rooms
grew from a study made about 15

of Pitt students. As a result of"the
study, it was decided to construct
the following rogms: Swedish, Ger-

English, Italian, Lithuanian, Nor-

ous at the University. The Chinese
memorial room is the only excep-
tion.

The nationality classrooms are to
be reminders of the great variety
of cultural heritages in Pittsburgh
and as testimonies that the best
contributions of these cultures will
never be forgotten. “They are re-

Besides supervising the construc-

rooms, Mrs. Mitchell is collecting

Do you know why your boy-
friend in the army hasn’t been get-
ting your love letters?

Have you got any idea why your
draftee-cousin took a pot shot at
you with a Garand the last time
he was in town on leave?

Postmaster Bodkin of the US
Post Office, downtown, has what
we believe is a satisfactory solu-
tion: you just don’t address your
letters to these soldiers correctly.

If an address is wrong or incom-
plete the postofﬁce has to turn
the mail over to the Army, and then
the , Army has to spend a lot of
time ﬁguring out whereinell Pri-
vate John Smith, Camp Rugged,
USA, is.

For instance, one camp has a
twelve man directory section han-
dling mail.

“In some instances several com-
panies of the same regiment may
be stationed at from two to four
dilferent locations, and therefore
it is of great importance that the
address show the particular unit
with which the addressee is con-
nected,” writes Bodkin.’ '

Correctly addressed mail should

: include the name, "and the rank of
the addressee, and the particular
unit to which he is assigned.

« All mail should bear in the up-
per left corner of the address side
the return address of the writer.

Below are examples of correctly
addressed mail:
