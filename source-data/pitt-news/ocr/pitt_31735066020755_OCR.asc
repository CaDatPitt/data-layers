A Pitt student who was sexual-
ly assaulted by another student
on Dec. 15 in a third-floor class-
room in the Cathedral of Learn-
ing will not press criminal
charges against her attacker, ac-
cording to a Campus Police
report. —

The victim, a 19-year-old resi-
dent of Holland Hall, has brought
her case to the Office of Resi-

"adence Life and hopes to have the

case heard by the Pitt Judicial

Board, according to Walt Waters,

director of the Campus Police.

WASHINGTONXAP) - The
college class of 1993: They're
starting to smoke more. They may
be losing interest in business
careers. And they overwhelming-
ly favor mandatory AIDS and

Qlrug testing.

These were some of the find-
ings in the 23rd annual survey of
incoming college freshmen by
the American Council on Educa-
tion and the Higher Education
Research Institute at the Univer-
sity of California at Los Angeles.

' The wide-ranging survey also
found that entering college fresh-
men are getting less aid from the
federal government and are in-
creasingly interested in college as
a means to land a high—paying

job. _

And the proportion of freshmen
who identified their political
views as conservative or far right
was a record 21.8 percent. But
large majorities of students took
traditionally liberal positions

_ when asked about specific issues

ranging from pollution and disar-
mament to-abortion and con-
sumer protection.

”lt’s because of the beating the
word ’liberal’ has taken,” said

‘-§Kenneth* C..Green of UCLA, as-

sociate director of the survey. ”A
’ lot of them think liberal means
impotent.”

On the other hand, the survey
found students becoming increas-
ingly conservative on matters
related to crime and the death
penalty. And two—thirds of incom-
ing 1988 freshmen agreed that
”the best way to control AIDS is

@through widespread, mandatory

testing,”-while 71 percent agreed
that “employers should be al-
lowed to require drugtesting of

to the incident.

According to ORL Director Jo
Ann Woodson, ”Our office is
aware of the allegations, and a
complaint has been filed with the
Judicial Affairs Office.”

Woodson did not release the
date of the hearing.

According to the report, about
11/2 hours after the incident took
place, police were summoned to
the victim's residence and took
her statement. She released the
name of her attacker at that time
but declined to press charges.’

employees or job applicants.”
The findings are based on ques-

tionnaires filled out by 308,007

freshmen entering 585 two— and

four-year colleges and universi— ,

ties. The results were adjusted to
reflect the total population of
1.64 million first-time, full—time
entering students, and have a
margin of error of plus or minus
2 percent. .

One of the most dramatic find-
ings was a rise in the number of
students who said they were fre-
quent smokers, reversing a
22-year decline. In 1966, 16.6
percent of the freshmen said they
were frequent smokers. That fell
steadily to 8.9 percent in 1987,
but rose to 10.1 percent among
those entering college last fall.

In addition, a record high per-
centage of freshmen (10.5 per-
cent) said they frequently felt
depressed, while a declining
proportion rated their emotional
health as above average (56.1
percent, as opposed to 56.8 per-
cent in 1987).

Survey director Alexander
Astin, also of UCLA, said the
three findings indicate increased
stress on students". He said the
survey also revealed potential
sources of that stress: concern
about paying for college, in-
creased interest in advanced
degrees and tougher competition
for admission to selective insti-
tutions.

A record proportion of fresh-
men said they were interested in
pursuing advanced degrees -
58.7 percent, compared to 48.3
percent in 1980. And a record
72.6 percent indicated ”making
more money” was a very impor-
tantfactor in their decision to at-
tend college. J

The victim also refused -medical
treatment for a bruised neck
which she suffered during the
attack.

Waters expressed frustration at
the victim's refusal to press crimi-
nal charges. _

’’If she doesn't want to press
charges, our hands are tied,” he
said.

The statement will be helpful

because it will allow the police
officers involved to testify at the
Judicial Board hearing, Waters
added.
- Waters referred to this incident
as an example of date rape
although‘ no sexual intercourse
took place.

Japan entered a new imperial
era of Heisei, or ”achieving
peace,” while thousands of
police were deployed to prevent
attacks by radical leftist and right-
ist groups who equate the em-
peror with Japanese militarism
and nationalism.

While 438,376 mourners
braved drizzling rain to honor the
dead emperor at the Imperial
Palace, less respectful opposition
legislators squabbled about who

The end of Hirohito’s era of
”enlightened peace” ended
Saturday when he died.

Hirohito, 87, died of cancer af-
ter a 62-year reign that stretched
from Japan's descent into
militarism and defeat in World

War II to its astonishing recovery

.to become an economic su-

perpower.

Chief palace physician Akira
Takagi said doctors knew in Sep-

final budget proposal Monday, a
$1.15 trillion spending plan that
would award the military a hefty

to boost spending for education,
child care and housing without
raising taxes, while at the same
time erasing the budget deficit
through a ”flexible freeze” on

9Prosecutin g , North
is futile and a farce

The remaining clutter of the Iran—Contra scandal is about
to be cleared up, with the trial of Oliver North for the mis-
use of funds. Instead of dealing with the matter of the in-
fringement of Congressional law that North participated
 in, the prosecutors are devoting themselves to the ques-

No punishment is too

clients admit to nothing, but they a

buy himself snow tires.
It is just as well.

, A tion of whether or not North used Iran-Contra money to .

North's involvement is not that of a man taking the law
into his own hands in a megalomaniacal frenzy for the

purposes of making the world safe for democracy. North .

was not in that kind of instigatory position.

For North, a well-trained, and somewhat low-ranking
v§)fficiaI involved in a covert operation, it was a simple mat-
‘ te?r:~-of—-'choice.- Or rather, a lack thereof. ’

Walking’ away from a covert operation, and a direct ord-

_ er from a high—rankin‘g"official is not as simple as refusing
_ to play volleyball on Sunday afternoon. Once North had
been briefed on the situation, he knew too much for him

to turnhis back and be assured of his career or his life. '

The trial is a farce. The proponents of prosecution ar-
I '§en’t really interested in seeing him pay for these charges.
They want him to pay for other actions.

And it is futile to make the attempt. It is probable that
North will receive a presidential pardon for these charges.
Those who should be punished for his actions are inac-
cessible. North’s trial is simply for those who want a taste

of blood.

Visiting both sides of Mexico

It's great to be back here at Pitt.

For people who know me, this
might sound a little strange, since
I spent my Christmas vacation in
Mexico. .

Yes, while most Pitt students
trudged "through the bitter cold of
Pennsylvania in midwinter,_ I

JASON
HILLMAN

basked on the . sun-drenched
shores of Sonora Bay, Mexico.

My family and I, all 21 of us,
flew down to Mexico on Dec. 23,
one day before Christmas Eve. It
was a 20-minute bus ride from
the tiny airport to the Club Med
resort where we were to stay. All
I could see during that ride was
desert — barren land littered by
brush, cacti, and small, un-
finished buildings.

The resort itself was beautiful.
It was surrounded by sharply. ris-
ing mountains. There were fields
of grass, of all things, which were
watered daily. There were also
palm trees, basketball courts, 30
or more tennis courts, a heated
outdoor pool, a fully stocked bar
and dining room and even a
disco.

As you can imagine, I took full
advantage of all of these things,
especially the heated pool and
the dining room. The rest of my
time I spent lying around the
pool, sunning myself.

On the fourth day, my brother
and I decided to-climb one of the
mountains along the beach to
take some photographs. The
mountain was dusty and cracked,
covered with thorny bushes and
loose, brittle rocks. It, like the
desert, seemed devoid of life ex-
cept for a few thin cows and
birds,'which circled in the sky
above. It’was a rough climb.

The view, however, was mag-
nificent. The -resort looked like a
tiny green speck in the surround-
ing tan and brown of the desert.

It seemed to me to be quite a
feat for Club Med to have creat-
ed a resort from these surround-
ings. The expense of bringing
fresh food and water, providing
electricity and planting and
watering grass had to be
enormous.

I found the thought a little op-

pressive.

The week finished slowly.
Some 300 guests packed up and
we all boarded buses to ride back
to the airport. After we reached

the opposite side of the mountain
I had climbed, I noticed a small
grouping of hovels on the beach
to our right. The "houses" were
made of corrugated iron slabs,
put together in a makeshift sort of
way, like a tree house on the
ground. The people who lived in
these shacks waved to us as we
drove by.

I was amazed that these people
live next door to a fashionable
resort. They lived on the beach
not because they wanted to, but
because they had to, in order to
survive.

I am not trying to say that I did ,
not enjoy my vacation. In fact, K
much ofthis comes in retrospect. '
But I had felt some of the oppres- .:.i.

sion of the life there, of thinking if I

that someone had to live there in- V,
stead of just visiting.

Now, being back in Pittsburgh, 

I much prefer the rat race and the
classes to what Mexico had to .
offer. Hell, now, sometimes, I ‘
even enjoy listening to the drone
of one of my professors (but-not
all the time).

All in all, Mexico may be a nice
place to visit, but I wouldn't ever
want live there.

”Now just a minute — we're

”The public lost their shirts in

protect them. I can't let your peo-
ple off. America will say that I am
soft on criminal racketeering.”

”What if Pixelagrees to pay
$500 and put in 10 days of com-
munity service at a health club?
Would that satisfy the hardliners
in the Justice Department?”

’’I don't think so. But I might
consider a guilty plea in which
your clients. agree to serve'3O

days as valet car-parkers at the»

Westchester Country Club.”
”You must be kidding. Valet
parking is cruel and unusual
punishment. Pixel only stole $2
billion. Wouldn't justice be bet-

\

tenced to 15 days retrieving balls
from a golf—driving range?”

”You better get serious, Noel.
Unless you come up with a satis-
factory proposal, we're going to
go for a jury trial.”

”For argument’s sake, let's say
that my people admit that they
made a couple of mistakes. In ad-
dition, they ‘agree to give back
half the money they obtained by
methods which might not be con-
sidered kosher. This should take
care of the entire matter and
everyone could go about their
business as usual. Mind you, I'm
not sure if my clients will agree
to that as theylmay have spent the
$2 billion already.”

”It won't fly. There has been
too much press on this story and
we can't make it look as if the
government caved i'n again. The
only thing I would consider at

this point is if Pixel gives back 60

percent of the ill-gotten gains,
and all the partners serve as bus-

boys in the Big Boy restaurant of
their choice for one week.”

”I doubt if I can persuade them
to buy it. They're not going to ac-
cept the humiliation of working,
in the restaurants where they
usually eat.”

”Take it or leave it. I have to go
to a-press conference in a few
minutes.”

”Wait. Perhaps we could take
the deal. But does it mean that
Pixel has to admit any
wrongdoing?” . “

’’Of course, not. When it comes
to white-collar crime, a plea of
guilty means your heart is in the
right place.”

Panthers can't overcome Boston College

By Mike Rampa
Staff Writer

One victory does not a sea-
son make.

After defeating sec-
ond-ranked and previously un-

. defeated Syracuse 81-76 only

two nights before, the Pitt
basketball team learned just
how hard it is to compete in
the Big East as the Boston Col-
lege Eagles handed the Pan-
thers a 95-83 setback Saturday
night at the Fitzgerald Field
House before a sold-out house
of 6,798. —

All-Big East guard Dana Bar-

. ros scored a phenomenal 43
points, hitting nine of 16 three-

pointers and shooting a perfect
six for six from the charity line.
The point total and three-point
tota|_are both new Big East
records.

The Eagles improved their
record to 8-4 overall‘, 1-1 in
the Big East, while Pitt fell to
7-5 (1-1).

BC Coach Jim O'Brien said
of Barros, who scored more
than 30 points against the Pan-

. thers for the third consecutive

game, "He demonstrated
tonight what we believe to be
true; that he is one of the pre-
mier guards not only in the
conference, but in the country.
I think that he is drastically un-
derpublicized on a national
basis.

"Part of the problem is the
fact that we have struggled and

. are obviously going through a

rebuilding situation. But he is
a quality kid and a- quality

player, and he had a great,

game tonight.”

O'Brien was extremely’con-
cerned coming into Pittsburgh
after the Panthers’ stunning
upset of the Syracuse Orange-
men in the Carrier Dome.

"Pitt has been very inconsis-
tent  their losses against Du-

quesne and Siena I'm sure-

they were disappointed with,

but then they turn around and a

go down and win at Florida, [a
90-87 victory on Dec. '22]

which is not an easy place to

win.

"We felt that if we could get
them on the right night, then
we would have a chance to
win. Then we watched that
game on Thursday [Pitt vs.
Syracuse] and I'm saying to
myself, 'How the hell are we

._going to win that game on

Saturday for ourselves?’ "
O'Brien said.

Barros gave his coach an in-
dication of what.was to come,
scoring 18 first-half points. But
Pitt started off on the right foot,
albeit "flat," as Pitt Coach Paul
Evans put it, and they led the
Eagles for over 11 minutes of
the first half. Pitt's biggest —
and last .—- lead was 24-21 at
the 8:53 mark as center Bob-
by Martin sunk two ‘free
throws after he was fouled by
BC forward Doug Able.

However, the party was
over for the rest of the night as
Barros and the BC offense
kieked into high gear.’

Pitt was down nine, 45-36,
at the half and never
.recovered. ,

BC broke out with a venge-
ance atthe start of the second

half. Barros~hit five three-

pointers and scored 17 of the
Eagles’ first 21 points of the
half to push the Boston Col-
lege lead to 66-48 with 11:39
remaining’.

BC forward Steve Benton
also scored 11 ofhis 16 points
in the second half, nine on free
throws.

Point guard Sean Miller,
who scored 11 points, ended
the Pitt" scoring drought and
brought the Panthers back
within 17 as he sunk one of
two free throws on O’Brien’s
technical foul.

Jason Matthews, Brian
Shorter and Martin all com-
bined to sink 10 out of 11 free
throws as BC committed six
fouls in the next 2‘/2 minutes.

Martin scored a team-high
21 points for Pitt, while Short-
er added 20 and Matthews 16

before fouling out along with ’

teammate ‘Darelle Porter and
BC forward Reggie Pruitt and
guard Bobby Moran.

Reserve guard Pat Cava-
naugh stepped in and provid-
ed some very effective defense
against Barros, even though
the damage had already been
done. ‘ -

"He got up on me, and he
was very aggressive,” Barros
said of Cavanaugh. "He came
in at a point where l was tired
and he just dogged me."

Pitt played a much more ag-
gressive second half as the full
court press went into effect.

Matthews stated, "We played.

hard the second half; I don't
think we gave upat all. We
tried to press them and put
them on the foul line, but they
made their foul shots.”

Matthews sees team fatigue
as playing a part in Pitt's over-
all court performance. "We
don't have a deep bench;
we're just about in the shape
we need to be in.

"When we're tired, we're

supposed to raise our hand
and come out, but you feel so
confident in yourself, you
don't really want._ to come
out,” Matthews said.

Indeed, the Pitt bench did
not contribute very much,
with the exception of Cava-
naugh, who scored five points
and dished out four assists in
15 minutes. Nate Bailey, Der-
rick Layton, Steve Maslek and
Gilbertjohnson combined for

. two points and three rebounds

in their 15 minutes of play.
Pitt did not come up big in-
side in the rebounding depart-
ment,;V_losing the edge 30-28.
Shorter had only three re-

bounds the ‘entire game._

."Our rebounding was real-
ly poor. If Shorter can't get
more than three rebounds in
40 minutes, we're in trouble,"
said Pitt Coach Paul Evans.

‘ Matthews said, "As far as re-
bounding goes, |'don’t know

’ what happened tonight. I tried

to get in there and grab a few
key rebounds but we just
didn't do it on the boards."

Rod’ Brookin did not play '

due to illness, which may have

Guard Dana Barros dominated the game Saturday night.

Barros’ hot hand gives

BC the lift

By Vince Carey

Sports Editor

Basketball is considered a‘
team game. It takes everybody
working together as one for a

' team to be good.‘

Boston College senior guard
Dana Barros disproved that
Saturday night when his Eagles
were able to beat the Pitt Pan-
thers 95-83. Barros pumped in
a Big’ East record 43 points and
in the middle of the second
half, he single—handedly took
Pitt out of the game with a
string of four three-pointers.

''It was about time that I had
one of these’ games," the
5-foot-1 1, 170-pound fireball

said. "l got the rhythm, and
you can't explain when you
get like that. Whenever the
hoop looked close ljust shot
it." 1
And shot it he did. With a lit-
tle over 17 minutes left in the
game, Barros started to get the
feel and sunk a trey. Pitt's Bri-
an Shorter hit two free throws,
but Barros countered with
{another three from virtually‘

they need

A Bobby Martin layup for
the Panthers was followed by

yet another three, and there _

was a feeling that something
big was happening. Darelle
Porter tried to take some of the
heat off with a finger roll, but
Barros was unstoppable as he
hit a shot just inside the line.
Ten seconds later he hit yet
another trey, and after a Pitt
time-out he put one more up.

Through it all, he outscored
Pitt, 17-6. For all purposes, the
game was over. Pitt was out of
its game and could never
recover.

"Dana Barros was just terrif-
ic," Pitt Coach Paul Evans
said. "We talked to our kids
about Barros_ having a hot

3 night and ‘it not affecting our

play, but I think it did. Jason
[Matthews] only shot two for
eight in the first half, and he
was worrying about what Bar- -
ros was getting against him. It

kid's offense because of what
he was doing.

Women ’s

swim team

prepares
for '89

By Chris Bosak

Staff Writer

After an impressive first half,
the Pitt women's swim team now
sets its sights on the tougher sec-
ond half of the season.

Pitt's next competition _is on“

Jan. .14 against a very good Penn
State team. This will be Pitt's last
home dual meet of the season.

It figures to be a very close and

exciting meet, typical of any Pitt- .

Penn State rivalry. Pitt Coach
David Belowich said "it is too
good of a matchup to predict any
results yet, but he added that the
Pitt team can't make any mistakes
if they want to win.

”lt's a matter of who wants it
more in the last five yards," said
Belowich. "That's what it comes
down to."

That "last five yardsf’ is an area
Belowich wants to work on more
this half. Even though‘5E_itt boast-
ed a 3-1 dual-meet record and an
impressive Pitt Invitational first-
place finish in the first half, Be-
lowich feels the team could boost

- itself to another level of per-

formance.

"We ‘have to get a little
stronger, a little better condi-
tioned, and we have to perfect
our technique," said Belowic_h.
“Everybody has to raise their
standards, myself included.” :3

Pitt will have to meet thezse
higher standards in order to cap-
ture its seventh consecutive Big
"East title. ;

Pitt will once again host the Big
East Championships to be held
Feb. 10-12. Boston College and
Villanova look to be Pitt's tough-
est competition. Belowich
doesn't expect to dominate the
meet but thinks the results could
be similar to last year's Big East
Championships in which .Pitt
won. ‘

Pitt will be on the road for the

remainder of its schedule. Before 4

the Big East meet, Pitt will travel
three consecutive weekends for
tough dual-meet competitions.
On Jan. 21, Pitt faces a building
West Virginia team. The next
weekend the team faces Villano-
va, followed by consistent top-20
team, Ohio State.

But Pitt's main focus for the
second half is the Eastern Cham-
pionships. The championships
for the Eastern Women's Swim-
ming League will be at Penn State
on Feb. 23-25.

Harvard will be heavily favored
in the meet, but Belowich thinks
Pitt has a good chance for a sec-
ond-place finish. Penn State took
second last year and_could be a
major competitor with -Pitt for
second place this year. _

Belowich predicted, "Our per-
formance at Easterns will depend
on how healthy we stay, and how
much improvement we see."

defensive player, though, [and]
he came in at that point when I
was tired and he just dogged
me.i’

Barros is a ”quiet” player in the
Big East, overshadowed by
guards like Sherman Douglas
(Syracuse), Charles Smith
(Georgetown) and Miller. Yet, he
is just as dangerous as any of
them. Q

”When he's got it going, you
just have to let him go,” BC
Coach Jim O’Brien said. ”We just
ran our; plays towards’ him and
gave hijn the green light.”

Barros is comfortable in that
role an feels he plays better be-
.f it. .

”I don't compare myself to
other players; I just .-want to play
my ga e,” Barros said. ”I don't
want t be the super pub star. I
want tol be a good player, don't
get me wrong, I want therespect,
I’m justnot going to seek it. I just
want to play the game and com-
pete in the Big East.”

”It Isl really hard to [defend
against]l a person like that,” Mat-
thews 5 id. ”He is a great offen-
sive plﬁ/er, and when he gets it

going, t- ere is ‘not too much you

can do about it.” ‘

BC.used a series of picks and
screenslto free up Barros, and Pitt
just couldn't compensate fast
enough.

”I think it was a little bit of a
mental lapse,” Matthews said.
”-We were supposed to get a man
on the other side of the screen
and stop his progress or slow him
up. We didn't do that.”

”The. rest of_the guys on the
team did a great job setting me
up,” Barros said. ”I was open af-
ter thejpicks, and I think that's
what gbt.me going in the be-
ginnin '." .

' — Barros has been a stalwart play-

er for the Eagles since he started

.in '85, averaging 18.5 points

through three years.

”‘I think playing at‘ Boston Col-
lege has helped me improve my
game _so much more,” Barros
said. ”When I know that teams
are going to run junk defenses on
me it has made me work that
much harder in the off—season.
When I'm -playing in the summer,
I’m not just playing, I'm thinking,
’Oh God, I've got to face box-
and-ones all year.’

’’I think over four years it's
made me a ‘much better player,

' than if I was at a bigger school 9
‘and playing with four other great .-
players around more. My game"

has gone up to the next level.’-’

The three—point shot in college
basketball measures 19 feet nine
inches and has come under a lot
of controversy because some say

it is too short. Barros disagrees. .

”The shot looks :close when
you are wide open, but when
somebody is all over you, it is not
short at all,” Barros said; ”It is not

any easy shot to hit anytime you -

feel like it.” .

Saturday night, Barros looked
as ifhe could hit from anywhere
on the floor anytime he felt like it.

Bengals and ’Niners to meet in rematch of ’82Super Bow]

By Barry Wilner

AP Sports Writer

CINCINNATI — The Cincinnati

Bengals shuffled through the Jun-

gle and into the Super Bowl
Sunday.

With star rookie running back
Ickey Woods prancing into the
end zone twice and running for
102 yards on 29 carries, the Ben-

” gals won their second AFC cham-

 

as

pionship with a 21-10 victory
over the Buffalo Bills.

The Bengals, Super Bowl losers
in 1982 to San Francisco, will
play for the NFL title Jan. 22 in
Miami.

It was a remarkable turnaround
for Cincinnati and Coach Sam
Wyche, who finished 4-11 a year
ago and was criticized for gam-
bling too much on offense. This
year, the Bengals are 14-4, and a
gamble was the key to Sunday's
victory. ,

”Especially after last year, to be
this victorious is great,” said quar-

terback Boomer Esiason.

’’I’m sure happy we stuck with
what we had,” said Bengals own-
er Paul Brown, who won three
NFL titles as coach of the
Cleveland Browns in the 1950s
and 1960s.

Woods scored on a pair of
1-yard runs, while the Bengals’
defense outperformed the vaunt-
ed Buffalo defense, holding the
Bills to minus 12 yards in the
third quarter and ending their
only real drive of the second half
with an interception in the end
zone.

With their no—huddle offense
virtually scrapped by rare, game-
day league legislation, the Ben-
gals went to a no—punt offense in

their clinching touchdown drive. ‘

An NFL edict before the game
assured that the Bengals would
notluse a quick snap to draw a
penalty against Buffalo for too
many players on the field. Bills
Coach Marv Levy had com-
plained about such a tactic.

CHICAGO — The fear of freez-
ing was nothing more than an ob-
ject of scorn for Joe Montana,
Jerry Rice and their San Francis-
co teammates Sunday.

Playing in 30 m.p.h. winds and
wind-chill factors of almost 20
below zero, Montana and Rice
combined for two touchdowns
and Montana threw a third to

»John Frank as the 49ers beat the

Chicago Bears 28-3 to set up a
rematch of their 26-21 Super
Bowl victory over Cincinnati in
1982. '

It was the first road playoff vic-I

tory for the 49ers since 1970, and
it dispelled the notion that the
Californians would be numbed in
the kind of weather that has been
so good to the Bears in playoffs
past.

The 49ers were almost flaw-
less, without a single penalty and
only one turnover.

Montana was true to his word
that his college experience in
similar conditions 90 miles east
at Notre Dame would stand him
well. He threw for 199 yards in
the first half alone and finished 17

of 27 for 288 yards, combining-

with Rice on a 62-yard touch-
down pass in the first quarter and
a 27-yarder in the second and
also throwing a 5-yarder to tight

end Frank in the third. .

Rice, a Mississippian, was
equally at home in the cold,
showing hands like an Eskimo in

catching five balls for 133 yards. . P

On his first TD catch, he leaped
high into the air to grab the ball;
on his second, he reached down
and grabbed the ball at his ankles
as San Francisco took a 14-3 hal-
ftime lead. ’
