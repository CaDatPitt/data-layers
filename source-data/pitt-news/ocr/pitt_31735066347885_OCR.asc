UN Chief Waldheim Pushes For
Energy Forum in Pittsburgh Visit

By DEANNA LOUISE

Secretary General Kurt Wald-
heim called for international
cooperation in the form of a World
Energy Order to resolve the
common energy dilemma of inter-

. dependent nations Sunday during a

convocation at Carnegie Music
Hall. .

The development of poor coun-
tries and the effect of energy prices

on the world economy in general '

emphasizes the urgency of meeting
a world-wide oil shortage antici-
pated for 1985, Waldheim said to
the assembled 93 delegates and
their spouses. ..

‘The ‘ceremony honored the
visitors on their one-day visit to

 

visitors’ afternoon.

Armthrough U.S. Steel’s Homeead works consumed a portion of,‘ the

permanent delegates visited Ten-
nessee. A

The order would monitor re-
sources, investigate alternative
energy sources, and try to- avert
future shortages.

Waldheim stressed the impor-
tance of conservation measures of
all the assembly’s concerns.

He also added global planning

based on the co-operation of those ‘

who _have financial and technologi-
cal resources and those who do not
should not be interpreted as any
infringement on the sovereignty of
states over their natural‘ re-
sources.” 7

  Graduate Employes to

Have Salary Increases

By RANDY GAYSEK

A seven and one—half percent
salary increase "for teaching assist-
ants and teaching fellows will be
instituted September 1 Executive
Assistant to the Provost Bob
Dunkelman said recently.

The across, the board hikes,
recommended by Vice Chancellor
of Planning and Budget Jack
Freedman, will boost TA earnings
to $3,578 for two terms, and raise
TF salaries to $3,818 for two terms,
Dunkelman said.

He denied the increase was a
response to recent complaints of
low wages by the University’s
TAs/TFs. saying it was basically a
move to keep Pitt’s standards
comparable with those of other
universities. .

“We chose nine schools in the
American Association of Universi-

ties (AAU) with which we feel Pitt
is in closest competition. In terms
of TAs/TF5 salaries, Pitt was about
fourth from the bottom of the list,”
Dunkelman said. A

The increase would place Pitt
somewhere between sixth and
seventh on this year’s list, but
possible increases at other univers-
ities may change that status, he
said.

Dunkelman explained the AAU
is a “prestigious” organization of
select universities of which Pitt is a
member.

Graduate and Professional Stu-
dent Association member, William
Voharas. said graduate, employees
are pleased with the increase.

“We have consistently called for
increases of graduate employe
beneﬁts and we’re glad to see an
increase come about in these
money-tight times.”

Economics professor David Houston assailed Chancellor Wesley
Posvar’s recent withdrawal of a 15-month contract offer to Paul
Nyden at a University Senate Council meeting yesterday’. Houston
labeled the move “cynical and self-serving” and alleged the

as opposed to academic.” .... ..Posvar responded deﬁnitely, “My
decisions are rooted in academic principles and weighed by my
conscience to the best of my ability.” Posvar recently rebuffed
Nyden’s acceptance of the contract offer he has been plugging since

he was denied renewal of his three-year contract with the sociology .

department last spring. Posvar told the faculty organ Nyden will
probably pursue ‘court channels. Nyden said yesterday he would
like to settle the case, still in appeal», within the University and is
trying to arrange a meeting with Posvar as soon as possible.

Another Last Chance I

Just when the Paul Nyden case apparently" had come to 'a mer-
ciful 15-month lull, during which we could expect to see each side
return to whatever it did when not engaged in an unflattering and
prolonged argument, Nyden showed he had yet another maneuver
available. He did this by responding to the Chancellor’s unusual

contract offer with an equally curious response.

Simply put, his seven-page letter of “acceptance” said, “Yes,
but...” .
It is obvious that Nyden meant to accept what was the meat of
the proposal: 15 months of work and the coincidental paychecks,
with a chance for additional employment later. His first sentence,

a “I am writing to accept your offer..,” demonstrated that. Up to

this point, everything was fine: A legally acceptable contract had

, been offered, and accepted.

But it was at this junction that Nyden obviously forgot that he
had been asked to accept an offer, not draft one. Posvar’s
proposal stipulated that Nyden had until May 26 to either accept or
reject the termsoffered, It said nothing about further debate. In
fact, Nyden could expect none, since he already had been accorded
every possible university channel in the form of reprieves and
hearings. ‘ ~

But Nyden, looking for the last word,-spent an additional seven
pages detailing his conditions and requests, mixing them with what
he called “sharp protestj’ Protest is fine, but not in the acceptance
of a legal contract. In fact, when one is dealing with a contract,
protest is as good an invalidator as any. If each side does not agree
completely, then no agreement exists.

Nyden’s choice of waiting until the last day to reply also did not
help the situation. By the time the Chancellor had consulted his
legal counsel and determined Nyden had not agreed after all, the
deadline had passed.

The University’s decision and position: Nyden has not accepted;

A the deadline has passed; Goodbye, Paul, thanks’ for the memories.

But this is where Pitt erred. We can understand the ad-

ministration’s weariness concerning this ongoing battle; many ‘
share-lit. But. this is not sufficient reason to blindly cast Nyden into -
1 the pool of unemployed social science professors with not-so-bright

futu ‘es.

The fairness Posvar demonstrated in intervening and making the
unorthodox proposal could be furthered by giving Nyden one

last—and we do mean last——shot. That is, make the offer again,

and allow Nyden five days to consider it. And have him respond
with one of two words——“Yes” or “No.” We suggest the return
‘ form be small enough to preclude any other comment.

This solution would not be another prolongation of the affair. In
fact, by alleviating impending court action, -it would bring the mat-
ter—for the moment, at least—to a halt. We urge the Chancellor
and his administration——and the sociology department-—to make
use of it, and soon. And if Paul Nyden is as intelligent as we may

A reasonably expect assistant professors to be, he’ll say yes—land

nothing more, so that each side may direct a bit more attention
toward the education of Pitt’s students.

Letter to the Editor 9

Professor Nyden’s letter to the
Chancellor concerning Nyden’s 15-
month contract extension indicates
that along with the Faculty Hearing

‘Board, he has not analyzed the

Chancellor’s decision as carefully as
he might have. To a considerable
extent; Nyden is correct, in that the
Chancellor’s “explanation” of his
decision virtually conﬁrnis Nyden’s
claim he is being treated as a
political dissident. But the worst
aspect of the current situation is
that the Faculty Hearing Board has
yet to be heard from concerning the
_Chancellor’s use of what it
produced.

Nobody has yet noted, publicly at
least, that while the Chancellor
accepted the board’s recommenda-
tion for a 15-month extension (a
recommendation apparently .made
only in conversation), he explicitly
rejected the Board’s central ﬁnd-
ing. While he acknowledged the

board’s ﬁnding he clearly _

“the criteria and
standards for faculty evaluation are
sufficiently common knowledge as
to contradict the finding of the
Hearing Board.” Attributing that
position to “a number of our

faculty’ ’ (unnamed), the Chancellor
concluded that because every

faculty member “knows” what
he/she should do, no speciﬁc
standards are required.

In taking this position, the
Chancellor not only overruled the
Hearing Board, but he implied that
the Hearing Board also had
overruled itself. He did this by
noting that while the Hearing Board
had found procedural error, the
board also concluded that the so-
ciology Department review of
Nyden had been so “professiona ”
as to eliminate any substantive
error. If the board agrees with the
Chancellor’s interpretation, then
the board agrees that its own

finding-is insignificant, thus.

demonstrating that a political
dissident cannot expect to be
handled “fairly” in this organiza-
tion.

Two other aspects’ of the’

Chancellor’s decision warrant com-
ment, because I dare say the
subsumed issues will come up
again: ,,
1. Much of the decision is based
upon some sort of direct communi-
cation between the sociology
department and the Chancellor, in
which the former accuses Nyden of
certain things and the latter accepts

the accusations without question.
Some of the accusations are

Nyden: Case Will Not Disappear

amusing in this post-Watergate era;

a in effect, Nyden is convicted of
being the John Dean of his
department by violating faculty
“conﬁdentiality.” Signiﬁcantly,
none of this was considered bythe
Hearing Board, so the Chancellor’s
decision is not based upon the work
of the Hearing Board.

2. By concluding that no error
had been made, the Chancellor has
reaffirmed (if not forthrightly) the
correctness of earlier decisions.
This means that there can be no
reason for any other attempt to
“evaluate” Nyden, and the device
of a “monitoring committee” to
supervise Nyden is nothing but a
hoax. This also reaffirms the FAS
Dean’s earlier decision and, since
there was no error acknowledged‘ in

procedures, there can be no reason
to reverse that decision. And he, of
all people, is the chief monitor!

It is understandable, if disap-
pointing, that administrations at-
tempt to be devious in explaining
what they do, throwing up a
smokescreen labeled “fairness” to
mask their actions. It is terrible that
a group such as theFaculty Hearing
Board would remain silent in the
face of such activity.

 Atom Advocate Refutes Uranium Critics

of sulﬁdes in the coal. Arid
uranium regions have little water
either for this oxidation or for the.

By JOHN PRELICH

The anti-nuclear. pseudo-envi-

ronmentalists have responded. to
my arguments with the vulnerable
statements that I will now expose
to the truth. First, I will deal with
an article by Gary Govert. He ﬁrst
condemns “the huge amounts of
low grade uranium ore that will
have to be strip mined.” The
illogic of that statement is
astronomical when you consider
the following facts: -

1. One pound of uranium

contains the energy equivalent of '

2.8 million pounds of coal. Even if

‘ you used very low grade‘ ore of only

.01 percent uranium, you can easily
see that to produce an equal
a_mount of energy you would have
to strip mine 280 tons of coal for
every ton of uranium ore. _

2. Coal strip mining is often in
rich mountain forestland. Most
United States uranium deposits are
in deserts or arid plateau regions.

3. Coal strip mining cause acid

mine drainage due to wet oxidation

].

existence of bodies of water that

I could potentially be polluted.

4. Most U.S. uranium deposits
are carnotite, an ore found only in

already highly oxidized mineral
deposits. Thus, virtually no
sulﬁdes are present and acid mine
drainage couldn't occur even if
water was abundant.

5. Carnotite is also the chief ore
of vanadium, which is essential for
high strength alloys. As vanadium
supplys get low, low grade
carnotite would have to be strip
mined anyway regardless of the
demand (or lack of it) for‘uranium.

6. Damage to the desert
ecosystem would be substantially
less than that resulting from the
conversion of thousands of desert
acres to solar collectors.

7. Unless all breeders are
stopped, the need to use low. grade
ore will not even occur.

11

Then the article goes on to

mention “the possibility of reactor
core explosion in breeders.” First

of all, for this to happen, a nearly ‘

impossible core meltdown would
have to occur before conditions

i could .-allow for the remote chance

of an explosion. Secondly, even if
an explosion did occur, it would not
have anywhere near enough power‘
to break through the outside
containment and enter the environ-
ment. The reason is simple. For a
powerful explosion like in a bomb,
you need a perfectly timed and
calculated force to hold the
plutonium together after the ﬁrst
initial surge of energy. Obviously
in this hypothetical “melted
puddle” explosion, such a mechan-
ism is not present.

As for the constant mention of
stolen plutonium going into bombs,
consider the following: To make a
bomb you need relatively pure
plutonium 239. or else a multibill-
ion dollar gaseous diffusion plant
for enriching natural uranium.
Although plutonium from fast‘
breeders is not very efficient for‘
bombs anyway. it is not difficult to

=\

further enrich it in plutoniuml240
which makes for nonbomb grade
plutonium. To‘ separate this
“tainted” plutonium you would
need the same ultraexpensive

gaseous diffusion plant as with
uranium. So why bother stealing
plutonium when you can easily get

, relatively cheap and easy to handle
‘natural uranium? Or you can build

a\ relatively inexpensive mode-
rated-slow neutron, converter type
of reactor. The purpose of this
specialized reactor is speciﬁcally
the production of ‘nearly pure Pu
239 for bombs.
Ill

As for Mr. Lidz and his article on
Thursday, I must say that I can only
see one major difference in our
approaches. Somewhere back in
grade school I learned that quoting
the few exceptions to a well
documented rule does not reduce
its validity. The fact still remains
that the overwhelming majority of
American scientists are in favor of
nuclear power. If Mr. Lidz has
“lost count” of all the antinuclear

_keep playing their

Nobel Laureates, then he really
must have problems keeping count
of the many more pronuclear ones.
Besides, unless these people are
‘speciﬁcally nuclear or environ-
mental scientists, then ‘their
opinion means no more or less than
that of any of their unawarded
peers. However, I do agree with
Mr. Lidz that in a democracy, the
people should make these deci-
sions. In places like California
where nuclear referendums have
occurred, I'm sure i I needn’t
remind him of how badly his side
has lost. As they
“save the
world" game, the stakes are
mortally high. Thousands of
Americans die every month form
fossil fuel plant respiratory dam-
age. How many extra deaths have
already occurred for every nuclear
power plant they have delayed?
These deaths are not the
hypothetical ones that the anti-
nuclear people hallucinate about.
but real deaths with real people.
and very real pain. sorrow and
grief. ‘

Alice Changes His Act

By M. PATRICK MONAHAN

When I first saw a photo of Alice
Cooper six-years ago, I nearly
vomited. If memory serves me
right, “Life” magazine was doing a
bad cover version on the out-
rageous Cooper and his band.

Alice was pretty hot when he
broke onto the American scene in
the early 70s. Onstage he coughed
blood as regularly as most
performers drink water between
songs. He obscenely fondled a
snake and even guillotined himself
at the climax of one of his bizarre
and bloodcurdling songs. What
else can you call “Dead Babies”
and “I Love the Dead?” Certainly
not a Captain and Tennille ballad.

When people first became aware
of his gruesome presence there was
also thequestion of Cooper’s sex.

After all, not too many guys were
called Alice, looked too weak to
crack an eggshell and wore
mascara at the start of the 70s.
Being an All-American would be
jock baseball player, my blood
boiled when I saw and heard
Cooper. I thought he was
disgusting and sick. So did my
parents (one of the few things we
ever agreed on?, and the rest of
America over the age of puberty.

I’m sure Cooper couldn’t have
cared what anyone thought about
his looks and shenanigans. The
more outrageous he got, the more
money he made. Indeed, Cooper,
the gross-out king, made his

~ fortune turning stomachs through-

out the country.

But old gross-out kings don’t
die when the public starts to shy
away, they go'Hollywood. Cooper
was the first biggie to make the
break for tinseltown, setting up
residence in Beverly Hills with his
new bride. Now we know folks,
Alice won't be a target for Anita
Bryant.

Plenty are following Alice’s
example and are moving to
Hollywood. The Eagles have
written and anthem about it in
“Hotel California.” Rod “the
Mod’.’ Stewart and Britt Eckland
are giving copy to Rona Barret and
Gregg and Cher are the Liz and
Dick of the 70s.

Alice has released three albums
since his band left in early ’74,
tired of taking a backseat to, him in
the fame and money sweepstakes.

His new album, “Lace and
Whiskey,” loosely deals with 21
Sunset Strip gumshoe from the
Bogie era. It’s so loosely
constructed it doesn’t make sense
or hold up as a concept album; it
does contain some tasty, straight
ahead rock ’n’ roll, however.

For Cooper, the album could be a
problem. “Welcome To My
Nightmare” and “Go To Hell”
were typical gore tamed down from
the ghoulishness and depravity of
the early days. “Lace and
Whiskey” is even milder.

Cooper’s image was built on
destroying chickens, beheadings,

Penguns Sign Iron Manwilson

PITTSBURGH (AP)—The Pitts-
burgh penguins, out to change their
image as a National Hockey League
club long on talent and short on grit,
signed Johnny Wilson yesterday to
a three-year coaching contract.

“We'll play exciting hockey,

assure that,” saidthe square-jawed
Wilson, dubbed “The Iron Man”
after playing 580 consecutive games
during his own NHL career.

“We’re going to have players
putting out this year or they won’t
be with the Pittsburgh Penguins,”
echoed Penguin Board Chairman
Albert Savill, who introduced
Wilson to reporters.

Wilson, who is celebrating his
48th birthday tgday, coached the
NHL’s Colorado Rockies last season
under a one-year contract.

He moves to Pittsburgh to
succeed Ken Schinkel, who re-
signed‘ after last season to become
the Penguins’ personnel director.

“Being a member of the
opposition and watching the hockey
club here in Pittsburgh perform, I
realize there is some rich talent
here,” said Wilson. “It delights
me.”

That talent took the Penguins to a
third-place ﬁnish in the NHL’s

. Norris Division last season, and the

club was ousted by Toronto in the

‘ ‘At the end of the season, I got a
little angry and told the players I’d
rather have the Washington Caps
playing for me because it would cost
half the money and be more

exciting,” said Savill.

One Penguin, talented center
Pierre Larouche, was suspended
brieﬂy during the season for
tardiness at practice and alleged

After the season, Larouche was a
standout for the Team Canada
squad, coached by Wilson, which
played in Europe in the World Cup
Tournament.

“I had the pleasure of coaching
Pierre,” said Wilson. “Once he got
some direction, he played extreme-
ly well.”

Wilson, a native of Kincardine,
Ont., played 11 seasons in the NHL
with Detroit, Chicago, Toronto and
New York before retiring in 1962
after a collar bone fracture.

He was coach at Princeton
University for two seasons before
joining the pro ranks as coach of the
Springﬁeld Kings of the American

~ Hockey League.

He later became head coach of
the NHL’s Detroit Red Wings
before being ﬁred in 1973, and he’s
since been a coach with the
Cleveland Crusaders and Michigan
Stags of the World Hockey
Association. He took over at
Colorado last season and helped the
Rockies improve to a 20-46-14
record.

Schinkel, the former Penguin O

coach, was a linemate of Wilson’s
when both played for the New York
Rangers. ~

“Johnny was a real hustler, an

lively player,” said Schinkel.
“When a team wasn’t going real

good, you could always count on

Johnny to get things bouncing.”

NEW YORK (AP)—With the

actively trying to trade pitcher Tom

at odds this season with manage-
ment.

But both Seaver and M. Donald
Grant, the Mets’ chairman of the
board, sounded as if a deal was
imminent.

“I have indications,” said
Seaver. ‘ ‘I can’t say why I know but
Ifeel I do. I feel I will be traded.”

Grant said if a deal is made for
Seaver it would only be to satisfy the
pitcher.

“We don’t want to trade the
man,” the board chairman said.
‘ ‘But time is running out and if he is
unhappy, we will have to satisfy the
man.”

Joe McDonald, general manager
of the Mets, acknowledged that
talks were continuing.

“There are a lot of names ﬂying
around, but no deal has been
consummated yet.”

Most prominent among the ﬂying
names was relief pitcher Rawly
Eastwick of the Cincinnati Reds,
unsigned and unhapvy With the
world champions. Eastwick has
vowed not tosign a contract with the
Reds and plans on playing out his
option to become a free agent this
winter.

The Reds are one of four teams
Seaver has said he would consider
joining. As a 10-year veteran who
has spent the last ﬁve years with the
same team, the ace pitcher has veto
power over any deal. He gave
McDonald the green light to talk
with Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Phila-
delphia and Los Angeles.

Besides Eastwick, the Reds’ offer
was said to include two other
players. The Pirates reportedly
offered center ﬁelder Al Oliver, a
bid that «has been rejected by the

Meanwhile, the calls continued

By J OANN KOWALSKI

The. Feminist Karate Union is an
organization that cares for women’s
physical and emotional needs by
teaching them “how not to be
victhns or victimized.”

"The Union began in 1973 as a
service arm of the South Hills
National Organization for Women
(NOW),” said Bobbi Snyder, chief
instructor at the Union, who holds a
fourth degree black belt.

Initially, the Union taught
self-defense to South Hills NOW
members, but within a year,
requests for entrance into the
program doubled. The Union then
broke away from its parent
organization and began operating
independently.

Snyder’s experience in karate
training goes back to 1964 when she
began teaching coed classes. She
was hired by South Hills NOW in
1973, and then realized that her
talent as a teacher could be used to
teach rape prevention to women.

“I much prefer what I’m doing
now. A lot of people say this is

5. discriminatory of me. The rationale

I. use is that there are a lot of good
male karate instructors around with
whom men can train,” Snyder said.
“Very few of those instructors are
sensitized enough to meet the

physical and emotional needs of

women students.”
Snyder views her self-defense
instruction at the Union as “doing

or my personal thing for the feminist

movement.” But there are
non-feminists as well as feminists
taking the classes, she added.
Self-defense not only involves
using one’s body ‘but also one’s
mind, Snyder said, adding that

using the mind may be the most.

important part of protecting one-
self. .

& Dresses

“Self-defense training concen-
trates on the total person rather
than just the physical person,”
Snyder said.

The teaching of self-defense
involves physical movements as
well as consciousness-raising,
emotional assertiveness and ag-
gressiveness and psychological
street plans.

“There is no point in a woman

learning physical self-defense if her T

fear and emotional problems
prohibit her from using it when she
needs to,” Snyder explained.

The programs offered at the
Union are open to women 13 years
of age and older, and include
beginning and intermediate situa-
tional self-defense and formal
karate training. Either or both of
the self-defense programs are
prerequisites for the karate class.

Two additional women instruc-
tors under Ms. Snyder, Pauline
Dishler and Sharon Hlawati, both
hold second degree black belts and
teach full time.

The Union also offers a teacher
training program for advanced
students holding a green belt and
above. . '

“We have ten advanced students
with two years or more of personal
karate training involved in the
teacher training program. The end
result of this training is that those
student simultaneously earn their
black belts and their teacher
qualiﬁcations,” Snyder explained.

Although these students teach, a
person holding a black belt
supervises their lessons at all times.

There are three areas of karate
training in the “dojo,” the
Japanese word for school.

“Kata,” the Okinawan word for
form, is the ﬁrst area—the aesthetic
form of karate.

“Kata”, is a combination of
physical movements that are joined
to form a dance similar to ballet,”
said Snyder.

The underlying meaning of
“Kata” is an imaginery battle, and
it is often called the “ballet of
death.”

The second area of training is
“kumite, ’ ’ or. free sparring.

“Individual karate movements
are taken apart and taught to
students in a free-ﬁghting situation
against .one other opponent,”
Snyder explained.

Students learn to use the “kata”
movements with control and timing
and are taught to box, with both
their hands and feet.

Situational self-defense is the
third area of karate training,
preparing a student to deal with

I specific situations she might

encounter on the streets—a grab, a

choke, a bear hug, a push or a*~

shove.

“Students learn to be offensive
and defensive, so that they cannot
only get out of speciﬁc situations
but convince attackers not to come
back,” said Snyder.

 FEATURE, etc.

,..\-._ . .

A large percentage of women
take self-defense training ‘ ‘because
they realize they could be rape
victims,” but many go beyond that
point and enter formal training,
Snyder said.

Snyder stressed that completing
a beginning self-defense program is
merely an introduction that shows
the student her physical assets,
liabilities and potentials.

“In ten weeks you can't become
Wonder Woman,” Snyder said,
adding, “Karate is extremely
strenuous exercise I which uses
every single part of the body. '

‘_‘It burns up a lot more calories
than tennis, swimming or volley-
ball, requires a great deal of
physical control and is tremendous-
ly challenging for personal
growth.” '

Karate is like any othe physical
activity-—“you only get as much as
you put into it.” The proﬁciency
level depends on how much time,
effort and energy one devotes to it.

A student can gain practical
beneﬁts from karate training,
Snyder claims, unlike swimming or
volleyball, which offer only physical
beneﬁt. .

At the Union, a student receives
the same formal training given at
other karate schools, with one
difference. ‘ ,

“We are sensitized to the
physical and emotional needs of
women, since we are all women. We
offer far greater space for personal
emotional growth,” Snyder said.

Ittakes three to five years to get a
black belt, depending on the
proﬁciency of the _student, commit-
ment to training and passage of
physical and written tests.

“Because we’re women, society
tends to look upon us as a
group——the weaker, frailer sex. In
keeping our standards as high as
they are, we've been able to turn out
extremely proficient, assertive,
aggressive, self-sufficient students.
They deal with societal problems
not as the “weaker” sex but as the
equals of men,” Snyder said.

Research studies, police and FBI
statistics compiled by the -Union
over several years show that
“rapists need victims. ”

“Statistically, a rapist cannot
and/or will not attack his peer,”
Ms. Snyder explained. “Self-
defense training involves putting
women on the same emotional and
physical peer level with the attacker
to avoid dangerous and violent

' situations. ’ ’

Ms. Snyder said that the entire
self-defense program is geared
around this philosophy and added
that they have had “tremendous
success.”

“Students have been attacked
and have gotten out of terribly
dangerous situations. We ﬁnd our
methods extremely e_ffegt_ive," Ms.
Snyder said. ‘ .j  l I

The Feminist Karate Union, the
only women’s “dojo” in Pennsyl-
vania and one of approximately 15
in the country,
successfully with other
schools.

“Our growth rate in four years, in
numbers, has gone from 12 to 200, ”
Snyder said’.

Anyone can take karate training,
except persons with a physical
handicap such as a heart condition
or ruptured disc.

Ms. Snyder said that the Union
has had many handicapped stu-
dents who were blind or deaf, polio
victims, arthritis sufferers and
persons with birth deformities.

“Our philosophy in accepting
handicapped students is that your
physical disability limits you only as
far as you allow it to,” Snyder said.

Pregnant women have been
self-defense students, and one of
the instructors Sharon Hlawati, who
was pregnant while taking classes,
claims that she had a far easier labor
and delivery because of them.
