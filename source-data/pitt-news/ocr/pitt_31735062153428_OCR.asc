Dear Editor:—— L L
. I read in last week’s issue several
items that interested me to the degree
of calling forth‘ this letter- One was
the warning issued by a student com-
mittee ‘against the illegal salexof «stu-
dent books, and your editdrial on the
same subject. I do not believe that

much part in this question, i. e., the
amount _lost by‘ the athlLetic_.committee
from the sale of these books. The
principal interest to every loyal Pitt
man is that students and no one but
students, shall be in the stands that
are supposed by the publicto. be ﬁlled
with loyal;vrootersL of the University.

of the student body and the athletic
authorities this may be remedied bp-
fore next season. ~ , LL
Another item of interest was writ-
ten by our graduate‘ manager. concern-
ing the great saleof seats for the big
games, the dissatisfaction. of, the‘

Lshallbe open to onlypaid up members
of the Alumni Association and the-
other-» that those who desireﬁrst
choice sha~ll_ purchase same by paying
sustaining fee of tendollars. L L L
LNow there is a feature of these
-plans thatCshould be noted; Why

should, the LAlumni,Association have

the right to say that if some“ of the

old Pitt-grads do so ,and so the.ygILnay L

have choice of.-seats at.athletic games
which are, under the control of another
body, .the Athletic Council=?L~.fL We ap-..
preciate that the alumni aL.re_L repre-

Lstantiala start for graduate. work at the

two bodies is a misfortune in one way

and it is to be hoped that some day

they may be independent of each other
in employees and controllinginterests,
but. until that L’tLime comes we beseech

"those, in control to ‘endeavor not to
use the advantagesof one position for

the other. _ ,
Lest you think that I am an“”ordi-
nary growler I wish to be understood
that the ﬁrst planzsuggested, to my
idea, is a good, one,-as every Pitt man
should beia member of the Alumni
Association, but as to the Lsecondone
it is unfaiLr.L L To the man who has -‘made
his mark, as one who had would nat-
l1rally,;suggesLt, such a thing thought-L
1ess1y.. and would not Lmiss that ,.ten

..dollars per annuin, this plan would be

fine, LgivingLhi~m1 the cream of the seats.
But as to the man who has notiimade
good wi_th.such' a vengeance, espec-
ially the recent graduate, this is not
giving him a fair: show, and remem-

that‘ team as the rich magnate has,
andperhaps does as much for Pitt,

laditgr Pitt Weekly:---—-

1 read with interest, your account
of the gathering held by the “Varsity”
letter club, after the ‘ilndian’-' game-—
in addition to interest there was also
a. feeling of ‘regret that the necessity

of earning a. living while’ in school, .
prevented me from making what I .

have ‘reason to believe would have
been a successful effort to become
eligible to this honored company.

.I am stirs those who compose the
club are the liveliest of the “live
ones” in the» Alumni and that the club
will not only be of beneﬁt to them in
keeping them "alive". but will also

beneﬁt the University by holding them

closer to it and help to build up that
spirit of loyalty and love for Alma
Mater which isso marked with some
schools and, not as much so as we
would like to see it with “Pitt.” ’

As I thought of what I had missed_
in not being‘-alet-ter man it occurred
to me that I had some consoliation in

the fact that while I was not an honor

man in athletics, I was one of the
honor men of my class at graduation,
and -then,-—well, comparisons are
odious, but the question that next oc-
curred to me was, why is there no
more enduying. recognition given the
honor man by the University, when
after all, intellectual development
and achievement is. the primary pur-
pose of the University‘?, should it not
offer as great inducements for pro-

ﬁciency in scholarship as it doésfor
. proﬁciency . in athletics ?,

could not-
someplan be devised by the Univer-
sity whereby the honors of a class
would to a greater extent than they
do at present, "stimulate . a, higher
standard of scholarship? It is accept-

I ed that the best man sets the standard

for the remainder of the class, if this
standard -can ‘be_ elevated, will it not
raise the entire class in proportion?

In my own case the “honors” con-
sisted. of my name on the commence-
ment program and in a few instances
the. thinly veiled dislike of some ‘of my
classmates, but as I was -in school-
for the “goods” and not, the z&‘trim-
mings”, the honors coming incident-
ally were accepted in both cases light-

ly, I-ac-c-ordingly.,. ' . S

Not complainlngly, but to show that
the honors at present are not the in-
centive -to scholarship they might be
made, the foregoing is written. ‘

Why could there. not be a. club com-
posed of the honor men-of the Univer-
sity? - ,   .  i

I know of no such club in any
school, but “Pitt”. is-big and old
enough to establish such a precedent
Was she not the
first to use the system of numbering
football players‘? ’ I '

The «objection may be raised that
such a club would savor of a “mutual
admiration society” or appear like
self gloriﬁcation--it would not any
more than in the case of the Varsity
letter men, please do not‘ misinter-
pret anything that has beensaid as
being discouraging to them or grudg-
ing them the honor they receive,
rather accept it as the expression of a
desire to see honor bestowed upon all
to whom honor -I is due, especially
desired for the reason that the be-
stowal can be made to accomplish good
£01; the University and for the‘ stud-
en s. A

Now that the subject has been in-
troduced let some of the “live ones”
in the alumni that were honor fmen,
bake it up and boost or knock the
idea as-gt seems best to them and let
us see what the reaction will be.

Old Pictures Are

O‘ Creating Interest

' c The picture of the 1898 Musical Club
published in the last issue of THE
WEEKLY created lmuch_ favorable
comment and several members of the
“Old Guard” havespoken to the Sec-
retary about it. Quite a few have

‘promised pictures of old time organ-

izations of W. U. P. which we can pub-
lish from time to time.

This is a feature which,is bound‘ to
prove very attractive for the Alumni
Page, as it will show thepreseiit day
clubs ‘how prosperous affairs were in
the days of long ago and tend to im-
press upon them the stability of the
University back in those days when
W. U. P; had its live student activities
just as Pitt has today, even though

‘they might not be developed on quite

as extensive a scale as at the present

Any -pictures‘ sent the Alumni Sec-
retary for this purpose will be return-
ed in just as good order as received.
In order to have a good cut made from
them for the Alumni Page, they must
be clear pictures and not too badly
faded. . Please remember this, alumni.
Send the pictures in at once.

Foil‘ some time the problem of prep-
erly recognizing the old football letter
men has been a bothersome one. There
was not sufficient room on the players’

bench and many who desired room.
there had to be denied it. For the

p _ , ‘.‘The Practical L

recent issue of the

ing of the Massillon Plant. .

A. “After iinany years of quietudé Mas-
sillon, Ohio, a town having a popula-
tion of approximately 16,000, has-sud-
denly, due to the coming of many new
industries, develo.p,ed into; a. typical
progressive American city, and at pres-
ent possesses all indications of a sub-
stantial -future growth. On account
of. the former conditions, the. local

_electric light and power plant which

is now owned and operated by the Mas-
sillon Electric & Gas Company, was
most naturally allowed to deteriorate
on account of its environment, the at-
titude being assumed that as long as
the wheels continued to turn all ‘was
well, . How they turned seemed to con-
cern no one. - ,
“Things, however, could not continue.
in this manner, and with the purchase
of thefproperty by Henry L. Dolierty
& Company. and the appointment of
T. O. eiinedy as general manager,
and A. V. Wynne as superintendent,
a great change came over this system
by which the power plant gained ma.-
terially. New methods of operation
tending toward increased eﬂiciency
were introduced, and, as soon as the
necessary funds became available, the
greater part of the plant was recon-
structed during 1914-15,.so that at the
present time Massillon has an electric
light and power plant in many re-

spects superior to those of other towns

of a like size.”

We note by the “Doherty News” that
the Durham Traction Company of Dur-
ham, N. C.,, is another Doherty con-
nection. Charles S: Reed, ’11, is with

Basketball Next  _
To A ttraet. “Gi;,ads’l

,When. the football season ends‘
Thanksgiving Dayi, the next athletic
feature to attract the attention‘ of
alumni will be basketball and a special‘
effort, will be made to have a good
turn out of the “grads" at the home
games. ‘This sport was given much
attention by the alumni last year and
the attendance at all the homeganies
was encouraging, indeed. Every game

saw a big turn out of “grads” and”

they enjoyed the sport immensely.

This year, with equally as good a
team as last year’s, which won the
State title, and with a schedule which
includes more big games than last
year, basketball is sure to come in
for mo“re« attention than ever before.
The ﬁrst big attraction is a game with
Yale University at the Trees gymna-
sium, December 21‘. This is the ﬁrst
time Yale has ever‘-met Pitt in any
sport other than tennis and the com-
ing of the Eli ﬁve will be an event of
great importance. Last year Yale won
the Intercollegiate championship and
many critics bemoane-d the fact that
.Pitt’s' great team did not have _a
chance to try conclusions with them.
This chance is to come in the opening
game of the year. '

Other games re with Colgate,» Le-

Eiiormous Demand for
Reservations from “Grads” Ne-
cessitates New Code of Rules
to Govern Distribution.

SUGGESTIONS ASKED FOR

- ‘In the last issue of the PITT

I WEEKLY, the important question of

alumni distribution of tickets for the
big football games of .the year was
discussed at length in the Alumni
Page and thenecessity for a new set
of rules governing this was ' pointed
out. For the W. & J. and Penn State
games,,the demand has exceeded all
past records and has grown from a
few» thousand dollars to over $10,000
for both these games. The demand is
greater than the supply, and it has
been impossible to take care-of the
wants of the alumni as they desired.
All could not be seated in sections -1, 2
and 3 or even4 and 5 and itheresult is
that there have been numerous “kicks”

from those who ordered tickets a little.

late and who are possibly not familiar
with the conditions and with-the hard

-problem which the athletic manage-

ment have on their hands with this
ticket distribution. 0.
~The work‘ done on revision of the
Alumni Directory and the resultantac-'
curate list of alumni to which the mail
order. literature was sent is largely
responsible for the great increase in
ticket sales to the alumni. Formerly
the list of addresses was very inaccu-
rate and possibly-not’ more than a
thousand or more of these letters
"reached their destination. With the
accurate list, and a total of over .7,000
letters sent out telling of the mail or-
der sale,‘ perhaps 80 per cent. of them
reached»-the parties to whom they were
addressed. v

With the great interest in football,
almost all of these people decided to
take advantage of the sale and there-
sult was that the Graduate Manager’s’
office "was literal1y'.swam.ped- with or-
del"s. Those who did not want tickets
for themselves purchased them for
their friends, and the result was that
instead of» a sale of a few thousand
dollars worth of tickets. as has been
the case for the W. &.J. and State
games in past years, the ﬁguresefor ‘W.
& J. went over $9,000 in the Graduate
M‘anager’s oﬂice alone, and for gfthe

State game that ﬁgure was exceeded
-'- a. week before the day of the game.

Seats in sections .1, 2 and 3 Were

rapidly “gobbled up” and some of the.-

alumni even had to be taken care of
in sections, 6 and 7. The ticketswere
distributed according to date orders
received. and no favorites were
played. With the unprecedented de-
mand, some had to be taken care of
with poor seats, which wasiregrettablie
but not within the province. of the ath-
letic authorities to prevent, under the
present system. .

It is absolutely necessary that‘ a
new set of rules be adopted, therefore,
as previously stated, to provide for

~ the ticket distribution and to keep the

graduates satisﬁed. Two of the points
suggested to be incorporated in this
were discussed at length in the last
issue. One was to limit the ‘number of
tickets to ,4 or 6, as seems best after
the matter is studied very thoroughly,

and to give members of the General”

Alumni— Association ﬁrst choice. It
was felt that loyal members. of the As-
sociation who are helping to support
the alumni activities are entitled to
this consideration. The plan would
be to have the members secure ﬁrst
choice" and then havenon-members

Pnrs SPLASH  
TEAM Vltlllll
uvu P. A. A.

The Pitt swimming team, strength-
ened by the addition of several ﬁrst

 

year men, turnedthe tables on their

old opponents, the P. A. A. team, and
romped away with the Open Aquatic

vmeet by a commanding lead of 21

points.’ This was the first meet of
the year and the unexpected strength
shown by the Blue and Gold splash-
ers forecasts a successful season.

Pitt early took the lead when the
Freshman four won the zoo-ya handi-
cap relay race. The University took
both first and second honors in this
event, as the Varsity team ﬁnished
close behind their younger brethren
and nosed out the Winged Head rep-
resentatives by a narrow margin. The
Freshman team was composed of K.
Lovejoy, Taylor, Rock and Shei-del.
The Varsity had Swope, Sweet, Lud-
wig and F. Lovejoy.

C. Hillman easily won the 50-yd
open handicap, whi.le Swope, another
Pitt man, won the 50-yd scratch race.
Harry Taylor neminded us of Buck-
land, and following his example, an-
nexed first place in the back stroke
race for old Uni.

‘The ﬁnals of the 50-yd open scratch
race furnished the most exciting
event of theevening. Coming down
the stretch, the ﬁnal spurt gave
Swope ﬁrst, Sweet second and Kee-
gan, P. A. A. third. Taylor, who is one
of the best all around water man that
ever entered the school, was the
fourth man, and it appeared that he
had placed in this -event, but the
judges decreed otherwise.

Three Pitt men took all three
places in the open novice race. Hill-
man, Gorman and -France ﬁnished in
the order named. Berryman swam a
nice race but lost out in the ﬁnal
sprint.

‘The team score at the end of the
meet showed Pitt in the lead with

40 points, giving them a lead of 21,

points over their nearest rivals, the

IN TURKEY DAY
GRID CONTEST

 

(Continued from page 1)

But Pitt -does not come down to «this
game the favorite that it might be
expected to be considering its reh-
ord this year.
seen in the remarkable record that
the Center Countians have likewise

their rivals in a rather easy manner.
The game with Harvard was really
won by the State men, according to
the accounts of the Boston papers. In
this game the Nittanites outrushed
and completely outplayed the Crimson
eleven throu.ghou.t the game but due
to bad luck and to the rulings of the
oflicials the Penn ‘State men were re-
turned. the losers. .
The meeting tomorrow will be the
eighteenth between teams represent-
ing the two institutions. Taking the
s-cores from the ﬁrst we ﬁnd that Pitt
is decidedly still on the short side
of the ledger. But this statement
must be discounted as the ﬁrst six
of -these were played and won way
back in the days when Pitt was still
W. U. P. Of the 17 games already

H. PAI NTER-—Center

played State has won 11 to only six
for Pitt. However since the organiza-

we ﬁnd that” State has the edge. Of
these eleven games Pitt has -won six
and lost ﬁve. 1

Penn State’s squad is one of the
best balanced teams in the country
today. Not only are they proﬁcient
in the forward passing game but also
in practically every line they have
men who are especially adapted and
experienced along this line. Ewing,
Berryman, Yeager and Clark are as
heavy and as fast a quartet as is play-
ing in any of the colleges in the
country today with the exception of
Pitt and Harvard. All these men are
fast and each one is proﬁcient in the
aerial game. At kicking they are
equally well prepared and are expect-
ing to show the Smoky‘ City people
some new stunts when they arrive.
To counterbalance this backﬁeld
Pitt wll offer a quartet of backs that
cannot be excelled In the country to-

day. DeHart will probably be‘ started
in at the quarter’s position. At halfs

Hastings. and’, Williamson will proba-

 

.the All-American team.

This cause of this is '

built up for themselves this year.-
With the single exception of the
Harvard game, State has downed

tion of the school on its new grounds.

my be seen. For fullback it is a
question of whether Fry or Mcharen
will be used. Probably both might be
rushed into the fray. “Chalky” has
been thecause of much of Penn
State’s woe during the past; two
years. In 1913 it was the blond hair-
ed streak that dashed through the en-
tire State team and -registered the
first Pitt victory for two. years--the
ﬁnal score being 7 to 6. Again last
fall after being’ out of the game for
five or six weeks he came” back and
due to his efforts’ the ﬁnal whistle
showed Pitt in the lead by a. score of
_13 to 3. T'his is his last game of in-
tercollegiate sport and the State men
are going to keep a wary eye-on the
ﬂeet captain. Shapiro and Beattie
are. two other seniors who will -have
their last opportunity to play on the
checkered ﬁeld. Both these men are
natural football players and may be
seen in the game. If Peck does not
recover in time it will be “Shap" who
will receive the ﬁrst call.

Peck, Thornhill, and Fry who have
been on -the sick list will probably be
,in the game at kick-off. Manson and
2Mil1er, both of whom it was expected
that they might be able to play are
out of ,the game for certain and no

hope of their playing can be enter-.

‘rained. Pitt’s two giant guards, Sop-
pitt and Sutherland are both in good
shape and will start the game. Thorn-
hill and I-Iockensmith seem to have the
call for the tackles. Herron and
Carlson will again hold down the ter-

m minal positions.

, Higgens and Thomas, both of whom
'were seen in action here last year,
will be seen on the wings for the
~Sta.te eleven. The battle between
Herron and Higgens should be a pret-
ty sight as each man is prominently
mentioned as likely candidates for

may be the deciding factor in the ﬁnal
determnation. Captain Woods at
tackle is one of the best line- men in
the State. He was seen. at t-he center
position last year, but when both of
the regular tackles graduated this
spring, he was moved over to ﬁll up
one of the vacancies. Czarneckie, a
member of last year’s'freshman steam
is a big husky chap from Erie high.
Although this is his ﬁrst year on the
Varsity he has made good with a. ven-
geance. Miller and McDowell will
hold down the guard positions. Peck
_.-will have opposing him at center,
Painter, the smallest snapperbac-k that
has played against the Blue an-d Gold
this season. But what he loses in
weght _he more than makes up for it
in spirit and pep. ‘

The two teams enter the game to-
morrow with Pitt a slight favorirte
over the opposing team. This is prob-
ably due to the fact that the Warner-
ites have completed the season so far
without a defeat. All things being
considered Pitt should. win if luck
breaks even. But—-and here is the
rub, the breaks of the game may fav-
or the invaders and it is these small
things that often swing victory to the
weaker eleven. But whoever wins it
‘is certain that the struggle will be one
well worth traveling many miles to
see.

As football supremacy is on the
wane, inklings of the coming of the
winter sports are heard. Basketball,
wrestling, swimming, track, ‘ and
hockey are all raising their voices
to attract the interest of “the fans.
Pitt’s outlook in all these branches is
the brightest for many years. The
pace set by the gridiron heroes is a
hard one to equal but the men on the
other teams are out to keep’ up the
high standard.

 

Helllstrom, Carnegie Tech’s captain-
elect, is one of the best liked fellows
in the institution. Also he is one of
the best centers that has .ever passed
the ball for the Plaid grid warriors.
His playing against the Pitt team
was an exception to the game put up
by most of the Tech players. His
election is as popular with the student
body as it is with the members of the
team. — ‘

 

Pitt’s splash team, with the aid of
several new men certainly ran away
with their olgilals, P. A. A. Several
meets are being arranged for the team
and if a. good plun.ger can be found,
the squad will be well prepared to
take on all rivals. We lost the dual
_meet with the Navy last year by los-
ing the distance plunge, and if this
‘hole can be ﬁlled the boys are in high
hopes of taking the ‘match this year.

 

for the Captaincy of the football ‘team
for the coming year. Chief among
these are “Bob” Peck, Rendell Sop-
pitt, and “Pat” Herron. All three of
these men have demonstrated their
football ability and each has the char-
acteristics that make for an ideal
leader. However it is up to the let-
ter men to decide andtheir choice,
no doubt, will be inﬂuenced by their
personal knowledge of the candidates.

“Pat” Herron certainly will have his
hands full against the Center Count-
ians. First he will have to buck up
against Wood and .Higgi«n’s on the
-offensive, and has to stop Berryman on
the defensive.

tainly ﬁll the bill.

P.er_'cy Haughton must‘ have taxed
his football brain to the limit last
Saturday just to show the worl-d that
Tom She-vlin was unworthy of all the

praise bestowed upon him for his vic-
tory over Princeton. If “a. 13 to 7 vic-

does a 41 to 0 lambasting indicate?

back into the clubhouse at gametime.
That’s the only explanation.

Fifty Candidates Out For    
First Baslietball Practicé  

Basketball comes upon the scene
just as the ﬁnal curtain falls upon
the glorious football season, and from
all indications Pitt’s -l-aurels in this
branch of intercollegiate ‘sport ‘will
be well taken care of by the floor ﬁve.
A victorious season following after
such a successful football year will
emblanon the name of Pitt upon the
national " roles W of “intercollegiate
sports.

The ﬁrst practice; was held this
past week. Between forty and fifty
candidates came out for the team and
there is much promising material in
it. Later on many football men will
be out and the squad is expected to
reach the century mark before th
ﬁnal selections are made. . '
The ﬁght for positions on the Var-
sity will be a ﬁerce one and the
makeup of the team will not be
known until just before the opening
game, with Yale on the 21st of De-
cember. In order to weld the men
into a smooth machine for this
opening game it will be necessary to
get as much practice as possible. The
men on the football team that will be
candidates are -already in ﬁne physi-
cal condition and t will not be hard
for,them to get into condition for the
passing game-.

"There are ﬁve men left from the
Varsity team of 1914-15. Captain Lu-
bio, Hastings, Carlson, McCullough,
Matson, -and Carlson. Ochsenhirt, Gra-
ham, and Healey are the other men of
last year’s squad, but none of these
are eligible this year. Bastress,
formerly forward. for the Grove City
tea1n;‘Moon, on last year’s E. L. A.
team; Lindberg fr-om Homestead,
and Ashbrook from Alliance high are
fourof the most promising of the
new men.

Lehigh, Colgate, ' Yale, Penn State,
W. & .I., Tech and Allegheny are
some of -the important games that are
on the schedule for this year. Ne-
gotiations are un-der way for games
with Lafayette and two games may be
arranged with them later.

Last year’s Captain Norman Och-
senhirt has been appointed coach of
the freshman basketball men. The
team last year made a. fairly good
showing and it is expected that this
year’s ﬁve will be able to go them one
better. “But-ch” has had plenty of ex-
perience in the passing game and
showed his ability by playing on the
Varsity for four years, the latter one
of which he was the leader. He will
also assist Miss France in coaching
the Co-eds team. .

The Co-eds. m-ade a. fine record last
year on the ﬂoor game. It was their
ﬁrst appearance in this line of sports
and they showed what they were cap-
ableuof doing by winning every one
of the eleven games that they par-
ticipated in. This year more preten-
tious plans have been laid and under
the tutalage of good coaches should
repeat their good record made last
year. ' -

Pitt's grapple-rs are now entering
the limelight. Under the guidance of
last year’s letter men, the anxious
wrestlers have been preparing forthe
strenuous schedule which has been
arranged.

A squad of more than 25 candi-
dates are out now and it is expected’
that the number will be augmented
before the ﬁrst event takes place at
«Penn ‘State on February 12. Captain
Reilley of last year’s’ team, together
with Forbes, :1-ones, Kendrick and
.Manager Huff, will handle the -squad
until the regular coach arrives.

Arrangements are under way with
Coach Reinecke of last year’s team,
but on account of business pressure it
is not known deﬁnitely whether“ he
will be able to teach this season’s
-crop of strong men. I

‘The schedule in its present shape’
includes besides‘ the meet with ‘State
on foreign mats, some tussles with the
Middies in Annapolis on February 19,
and a home event with Lehigh on
March 4. Negotiations have been

understaken with the management at
Penn State‘ to have their grapplers
come to Pittsburgh for a return meet
as such an arrangement will prove
popular with local wrestling enthus-
iasts. ,

Whoever is selected for the coach
will take charge of the wrestlers early
in December, but in the meantime
the candidates. are working out un-
der the varsity men.

V TheCVins’truVctor vinilcharge of Co-op« J

eerlng, Mr. J. W. Hallock,_states that
at the present time’ the cooperative
work is better,V'in nature and ‘extent
than it has been for some time. Be-
garding the\ present status of’ the
work Mr. Hallock stated the follow-
ing: A O L‘ .

“In general it may be stated that
any work which tends to broaden the
view of the average engineering stud-
ent will be of beneﬁt to him in secur-
ing an engineering education -and also
in the practical application of the
theory involved. However, it is neces-
sary to subdivide the practical‘ work.
that it may come under on the several
branches. of engineering thereby mak-

ing thg work more directly applicable,
to the branch of engineering which -

the student is taking up. .
V At the present time the students on
co-operative work are ﬁlling a variety

of occupations, the general‘ character V J

of whi-chfis better than we might ex-
pect. t This is. due to the good condi-
tion of business in gene-nal andfis cer-
tainlyVwork‘ing outpto the beneﬁt of

concerned in the‘-manufacture of war‘
