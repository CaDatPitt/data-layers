Marching Show Amazes
Minnesota Crowd

Precision marching was theby-word of the half-time presenta-

tion at Saturday’s football game.

Starting the show off was the Pensacola Pre-Flight drill team
composed of aviation cadets and midshipmen from the ;"avy’s
"Annapolis of the Mr,” Pensacola, Florida.

The team went through a series of close-order drills and the

manual of arms, with variations.

_They amazed the crowd of 40,000 with such things as the

passing of riflesfrom one man to
ipg, one tank
line of march and finishing off with
the Queen Anne salute.

The Pitt band then took overwith
some formations of their own, il-
lustrating "A Day With the Pan-
ther” with some of the cleverest
combinations of the year. The Pan-
ther’s day was cut short, however,
after Referee Mike Layden nearly
shoved Director Rdbert L. Arthur
off his podium so that play could"
be resumed. The band waited until
the final whistle, then reformed
and went through the whole routine
in lieu of the usual post—game sere-
nade.

Drowning the cheers for Pitt’s
mighty mites in the second half
was the roar that went up _when

Pitt’s 185-pound center, Len Rad-
nor, and hurled him five yards in
a good imitation of a lateral pass.

Congress Upholds

Invalid Election;

No Protest Voiced  

-BULLETlN- .

Student Congress yesterday moved and passed unanimously a motion
to retain the five unconstitutionally elected members on Congress for
the remainder of the term. There was no discussion at the meeting on

the motion.

By LEN BAKER.

The possibility of a re-election in Student Congress in re-
sponse to the announcement at last .\ionday’s meeting that last
Spring’s elections were invalid seemed very doubtful although
Ray ..Iaher’s "no comment” left room for speculation.

Flora Diemert, president of Student Congress, said that the

organization will follow “tlxat plan
of action that will most expedite
the work of Student Congress.”

hailed as Pitt's foremost expert
on tombstone design.

Parents Meet
Chancellor

Parents of September freshmen
will be guests of the University on
Friday, Nov. 18 at the Chancellor’s
Reception. The occasion will pro-
vide an opportunity for parents to
acquaint themselves with college
life as their sons and daughters see
it.

Chancellor Rufus ll. Fitzgerald
will greet the visitors with the
main address of the evening. With
him on the speaker’s rostrum will

be the deans of the under-graduate
schools.

The program has been prepared
in three parts: speaking and musical
portion is scheduled in the Commons
Room early in the evening.

Tours of the building willfollow.
Guides will show guests through
the Nationality Rooms, the fine
arts and library floors, and the
Blue TLCl( Shop.

The third point in the program
will be the Chancellor’s and deans’
reception line in the Commonslioom,
where refreshments will be served.

Three hundred students acting
as hosts and hostesses will wel-
come parents and act as aids through-
out the evening.

Coeds End
Rushing

Campus sororities tapped an un-
disclosed number of undergraduate
University women yesterday as the
formal fall rushing period came to
an end.

Ribbon ceremonies were held
last night at sorority meeting places.
Formal pledging rites will begin
tonight. \k.ith the advent of pledg-
ing, the women will remain neo-
phytes from six to eight weeks.

In two afternoon teas on Sunday,
Nov. 13, the Greek letter organi-
zations entertained rushees. with
not all sororities rushing this fall
approximately 100 women were con-
sidered. .

The new pledges are girls who
have met the scholastic require-
ment of one point and who have
been on campus for one semester.

Sorority bids were in the dean
of women’s office yesterday at 9:30
a.m. The rushees balloted prefer-
entially from 10 a.m. until 12 noon
on the twelfth floor.

The sororities were informed of
their bid replies by 5:45 p.m. that
same day. At 7 p.m. the rushees
picked up their bids and attended
their sorority meetings.

Congress has been in session for
over six of its twelve montl; term.

‘the invalidity of the elections
is based upon the fact that the
Pharmacy School voted at last
Spring’s elections. Congress’ con-C
stitution makes no provision for
the vote. —

This was disclosed by ”,laher,,
who admitted knowing about the
unconstitutional election since
last summer.

Of the eight male representatives
elected last Spring three have since
resigned. It is the remaining five --
Ray ‘laher, \Xi‘lliam Swanson, Dave
Cleland, Dick Campbell, and 30b
T‘»7cl'\'owen — who are affected by the
announcement.

He did," however, elaborate upon,
his reasons
information until last week. He
pointed out that the election had
been contested once by the Inde-
pendents and that they had, taken
a "bad attitude.”

“The Independents would have

been defeated in a September elec-
tion,” he said.
_ Don Ewart, junior representative
to Congress, called the electionta
"regrettable and natural error and
nobody can be blamed.” I

Ewart when questioned as to
whether
upon this opportunity to unseat the
one remaining independent, Bob
:‘.lcKowen, on Congress, replied that
the fraternities "donft wish to see
the Independents deprived of their
representation on Congress.” ’

Good Idea

A few fraternity men are gleefully looking forward to the first
issue of the interfraternity newspaper, due out sometime this week.

They look on it as an opposition sheet to the News, claiming that

the News is anti-fraternity in its editorial and policy views.
Perhaps this small group will be surprised to learn that we
don’t figure it as such, but welcome its appearance. _For, its col-
umns will take some of the load off our shoulders and pages.
We are the first to admit that the News, while it is compre-

hensive doesn’t ive com lete cam us covera e; we don’t have
9 8 P

to be told, as we are nearly every day, about the omission of items
in our twice-weekly editions. Some have the mistaken impression

that on just 16 pages a week, roughly a third of which carry ad-

vertising, we can document every piece of news stirring on cam-
pus. Take our word for it. It’s impossible.
In an attempt to remedy this situation, we started a news box

gsystem at the Student Desk, whereby a part of the load of catch-
. ing minor articles of importance can be lodged with the organiza-

tions and individuals directly involved. This way we expect to

- report the Pitt scene more easily and completely.

The situation of the new IF paper in the field with the News

gqompares, albeit on a smaller scale, to the weekly papers around

the county operating in close proximity to the dailies in the Pitts-
burgh area. Like the weeklies, the frat sheet can print in greater
detail and with complete concentration on the news of interest to
fraternity men, which we, like the dailies, can’t possibly record
as thoroughly with the wider coverage demands we must meet with-
in our space confines. » ,

As far as the competition some fraternity men think their paper
will offer us is concerned, it's a fallacy, when you analyze it. If
competition is their aim, it would have to come among readers
reached by both papers. In this case, it would have to be the vast
group of non-fraternity men, whom.,they allege we are influencing
against their setup. ‘let, their paper will only be distributed to the
men, whom, if there are sides, are on theirs. That’s obviously not
competition.

In answer to any charge of bias on our part, again st frater-
nities or anything or anyone else, it simply doesn’t exist as a

A policy of the News. Anything published on the second page, if it

opposes anyone or anything,is the editorial page writer’s honest
judgment. Of course, the other seven pages are devoted to objec-

_ tive reporting of the facts of life at Pitt. We have always prided

ourselves in maintaining this practice and will continue to do so.

Baker’s Ilozen

This is about the dinks -- again.

Men’s Council’s revitalized freshman program had a terrific
idea behind it. "Let’s make this new class feel like a class, give
them some real spirit,” they thought.

The dinks were distributed and the freshmen wore them.Then

nothing happened. The freshmen
stopped wearing the headgear and
to counteract this, Men’s Council
initiated a court which heard ap-
proximately five or six violaters.

Dinks Come Off

Of course the program didn’t con-
cern the dinks alone. It also in-
cluded some very successful mixer
dances, and some other events which
went over well. But these events!
are customary. The dinks was the
new part of the program and the
most potent of the entire program,
new and old.

The basic fault in Council’s
planning was that they didn’t pro-

vide a reason for the freshmen to
keep wearing the dinks. After their
novelty value wore off, off they
came. 7

What could have been done? A
number of practical, easily managed
"affairs.

Flock Together

The football games are Council’s
greatest opportunities to get the
dinks out of the pockets and on the
heads. Three or four orientation
groups with their counselor could
easily meet together before the
game and take it in as a body. Wear-
ing of the dink would be a prere-
quisite for the freshmen who came

Ietters to the Editor

_ the

Coffee Critic
Editor,
Pitt News

Haven't been able to pick up a
News for weeks that hasn't had
coffee spilled over it, so felt a few
pertinent remarks ‘would not be
amiss, particularly since this all-
important subjecthas finally boiled
over into the headlines.

Miss Cramblet made some inter-
esting statements in the Nov. 8
News. First, the TS policy is to
“make every item carry itself.”
To me, this doesn’t mean partially
paying f5r another item by the sale
of coffee. Also, I did not know that
in buying coffee I was being char-
ged to carry my share of the bur-
den “along with those who buy
sandwiches....” If I only want a
cup of coffee, I want to know I am
buying just that and not part inter-
est in a sandwich I am not even
smelling yet.

As for the numbered cups to the
employees, if I worked in the TS
for a living, no doubt the coffee
would take on the delightful aroma
of the beans grown in the cool high-
lands of Brazil. Nothing was said
of hundreds ofstudents being taste-
tested; just ahandful of employees.
Besides, the employees don’t have
to pay for their coffee. Let the pay-
ing customer decide!

As far as very little "coming
back undrunk,” it proves nothing
even if coffee was left before the
increase (and that hasn't been
mentioned). Naturally, with a 60%
increase in price, I am ‘interested
more than ever in not leaving a
drop behind.

And why all the fuss about the
"special blend?” With all the com-
plaints, why not buy rordinary cof-
fee,'charge a nickel and make the
customers happy.If this were done,
I'm sorry to say, Chef Kuhl would

have to take his refreshment next
door, or else set up his own little
pot in the kitchen. But, then, some-
times these small sacrifices must
be made.

Miss Skewis made the one shrewd-
observation in the article referred
to: “Tuck Shop coffee should‘not_
be compared with home coffee.”
She wouldn’t dare!

Now is the time for all good men
to come to the aid of the Tuck
Shops. In fact if there are any good
men around, they had better come
to the aid of the whole University
Food Service.

In an interview recently, the
Misses Cramblet and Skewis made
some startling statements. As a
result of these statements, many
students have taken up the cudgel
and come to sit in this corner.

Widen Crusade

We yield to these noble kindred
spirits and their demand for more
publicity on the high prices of
food as well as coffee.

For astarter, let’stake the state-
ment of these "only thinking of
you” ladies that 15,000 cups of
coffee are sold during a cold week.
That's $1400 for coffee alone in
one week.

This seems like an awful lot of
money for an inferior cup of coffee,
especially when many places right
in Oakland that we contacted charge
only five cents and haven’t gone
bankrupt yet.

The sandwiches, ah the sand-
wiches, see them piled high on
groaning trays, each one loaded
with a paper thin slice of lunch
meat, tucked in rye bread, if you

delicately printed signs, dressed
right, with little figures 10, 15, or
25. And the bowls of mustard, and
mayonnaise and pickles, free and
open to all.

Gaze on them, look at the meat-
ah, there it is, fondle them, and
then go out and buy a decent sand-
wich for a decent price.

I wonder who keeps the Food
Service books. They would prob-
ably make interesting reading.

We concede the best trick of the
week this week to a discriminating
chap who walked into the Tuck
Shop and handed the waitress a
coffee flavored lifesaver.

"What's it taste like,” he inquire
ed.

"Coffee," said the waitress.

"Now try to give me a cup of
coffee that tastes like that,” he
demanded.

Cathedral Beat

Call out the fire department for
this one. People on an express
elevator smelled something burn-
ing. Finally one potential absent-
minded professor said, “My gosh,
my pipe!” reached in his pocket
and pulled‘ out a stillsmoking briar.

Speaking of fire departments, one

of the most important jobs in the

Cathedral is held by a man who
every day at the same time inserts
a key in a little watchclock. If he
should happen to‘miss some day,
a host of fire trucks would come
screaming to the Cathedral.

Tomorrow's Heinz Chapel service
will feature Dr. Oswald Blackwood,
physics, professor. His talk will be
"Was College Necessary?” Should
be interesting to all.

This’n That

Posters advertising the Moon
Ball were stolen from their display
places at Ellsworth Center. “We
don’t know why, but the posters
had pictures of pin-up girls on them.

Ya know with all this talk about
dinks and such, we notice an item
missing. We haven’t heard where
the money realized from the sale
of the little toppers goes---—.

The whole freshman program, in-
cluding dinks, was over last Fri-
day. It’ll be a welcome relief to
see those absurd little hats packed
in mothballs. And Distinguished
judge Joe Wolfe can put his robes
and somber intonements away, too.

But to think that they’ll drag them
out again in February. Oh, well,
maybe the caps will keep some
heads warm, then. And Judge Wolfe
can practice a somber mien and a

As Owl Sees It

After reading the column McGuire
Inquires in the Friday issue of the
News, I wondered why my staff
and I are publishing the 1950 Owl,
For if students will give a News
reporter such ridiculous statements
about a student publication which
is planned solely for them, then
such a publication isn’t worth the
hours of hard work put into it. In
short why publish a yearbook?

There is an answer to that ques-
tion. If we convince only a small
number of students going to the
University the value of afyearbook,
then we have been successful. For
those students that take an interest
in owning a 1950 Owl will someday
want to thank the whole yearbook
staff for giving them a record of
the year 1949-1950. And to those
who don't take an interest, I only
wish that I could be present the
day you feel like kicking yourself
for not buying or being interested
in your student yearbook.

with the group.

This wouldn’t single the group
out to receive jibes from ‘the other
students at the games. For one
there would be other groups of fresh-
men also wearing the dinks scattered
throughout the Stadium. Also judg-
ing from the’ number of upperclass—
men who wore dinks at last Satur-
day’s game, the dink isn’t the sign
of a _freak but the latest style for
“Joe College.” I

Also the possibility of leagues
made up of the orientation groups
under the sponsorship of the coun-
selors doesn’t seem farfetched. The
frosh would really meet each other
as they battle on the baseball dia-
mond and football field.

There are also numerous affairs,
such as the Pitt Player's produc-
tions, the football rallies, and var-
ious assemblies, which the group
could go to as a,whole.

More Work

This would entail more work for
upperclass counselor. They
would have to give up their time,
going to the games with their own
friends, and just generally devoting
themselves to their orientation
group. But that’s their job. If they
don't like it, then the counselor
position isn’t for them.

Granted that a number, a large
number even, of freshmen won’t
like the idea themselves. Their
main reason against it will be the
fact that frat rushing affairs, their
own acquaintances, are taking care
of the things that this program is
aimed at.

Another Chance

But this enlarged program wouldn’t
be directed at them. It will beaimed
at those many freshmen who come
to Pitt not desirous of joining a
frat, without too many friends al-
ready at school, and who need an

impetus to their extra.-curricular
life at Pitt.
Freshmen orientation isn’t a

dead thing; it comes up every sem-
ester. Maybe next semester Council
can get some more life into it.

scene of the Battle of the Bulge.

At Zermatt in Switzerland George
and a friend secured a guide and
climbed a 13.500-foot mountain.

‘It was really rough,’ George
states. ‘We started at 2 o’clock in
the morning so that we could reach
the summit and get back down again
before the clouds settled over the
mountain. If anyone is caught up
there when the clouds come down
they are given up for lost.’

Luxembourg, which they visited
next, fascinated the group. ‘The
whole city was just like a big mu-
seum,’ says George.

The group spent considerable
time in Switzerland.

A visit to Paris climaxed the trip.
According to Cohen, the groupreally
cut loose there, visiting the famed
Follies Bergere and other bright
spots.

‘But even including our visit to
Paris,’ says George, ‘our expenses
averaged less than $1.50 a day on
the continent.’

The girls on the trip received an
average of three proposals of mar-
riage, and even the customs offi-
cials tried to date them.

In all the group covered over 900
miles by bicycle.

student relations committee of Stu-
dent Congress. Their purpose is to
give students and faculty a place
to meet and mix socially.

Phyllis Beck, head of the com-
mittee responsible for creating and
planning the Blennds, said she
thought the first affair was a "real
success.” In general, those who
attended seemed to like the new
idea, in promoting better faculty-
student relations.

As they entered the room, the
students were given name cards in
the shape of a dunce cap, stool,
and paddle. Faculty members re-
ceived mortar boa;-di cards as identi-
fication aids.

lJr. John W. Oliver, head of the
history department, was one of the
first arrivals. lle rounded up several
students, and a glass of Lem’n-
Blennd, and soon had a group en-
gaged in conversation.

About the time the line was form-
ing for seconds at the punch bowl
and cookie plate, Sidney Stark of
the Hlennd committee introduced
the “Blennders,” Sandy Thomas,
Rosemary Loeffler, and Llaine Mur-
ran, a trio from women’s Choral.

Several card tables were set up.
Mrs. Kenneth I. Lutz, political
science instructor and faculty ad-
visor for the Blennds, was playing
bridge at one, and Dr. ltrston V.
Miller, of the biology department
was talking with some students
at another.

The Blennds will be a regular
feature from now on. Students de-

....n Panther Ethics  

Nick Bolkovac Charged
With Being Chief Culprit

   

 

NICE HOLD ‘° No, the college
wrestling season isn't here yet,
but Panther End Earl Sumpter seems
to be having his troubles with
Minnesota’s George Hudak and an
unidentified visitor, who seems to

be knawing away like the Gopher
he is. Sumpter had just received a
third-quarter pass in Saturday’s
game. lludak that same afternoon,
gave Earl a face pummeling (see

story on right). The picture, how-
ever, would seem to be ideal for
the scrapbooks of those radio an-
nouncers who revel in describing
a "Welter of arms and legs.”

Oldest Grid Manager, 

Is  Mere Freshman

The oldest and youngest ofPitt’s
present football managers is Ed-
ward N. James, who calls himself
'22O pounds of animated paradox.’

James, who will acknowledge
seeing at least 30 football seasons,
is a first-year day student in the
College and the rookie of the man-
agers. Displaying adiplomatfs fore-

sight and the look of a woman about :

to be trapped into telling her age,
he laughingly admits to being ‘past
30.’
But one wonders how far past 30
when he recounts feats of ex-Pitt
gridders Dr. William D. McClel‘iand,
‘Tom Davies, and Chester A. Smith,
all personal friends.

Played '~3a1l, Too

Known to intimates as ‘Big Ed’,
James played football at Perry High
School under Smith. He alternated
between the tackle and guard po-
sitions. While at Perry, he also
captained the tracksters and played
forward on the basketball team.

After graduation he almost en-
rolled in a southern college. As he
explainediit, (A fellow offered me
a football scholarship and guar-
anteed that I’d make $75 a week
selling hosiery. I didn’t take him
up (I1 it though.’

Married Teacher

Married to the former Dorothy
Batchelor of Perrysville Ave., North
Hills, James is a journalism major.

His wife, aPitt graduafe, teaches
occasionally in Pitt’s elementary
education department.

Having attended Pitt evening
school, James, who is on leave
from his position of office manager
with Joseph Finch Company, is no
stranger to Pitt activities. He was
a member ofthe Pitt Evening School
Chorus, which took part in the Uni-
versity’s sesquicentennial «cele-
bration in 1937.

Had a Battle

Under pressure, Big Ed will ad-
mit that he took several courses in
accounting and personnel at Penn
State. But to offset this blemish
on his loyalty-to-Pitt record, he

BIG ED JAMES
Oldest and youngest

proudly recalls last year's Pitt-
State game.

Big Ed, who sat in the State
section of the stands, was heckled
throughourthe game by State rooters.
When Nick Bolkovac scored Pitt’s
TD, Ed turned to his erstwhile heck-
lers and said, ‘You can’t play Tem-
ple and Bucknell every week. See
how it is when you play in the big
leagues?’ In the fisticuffs that fol-
lowed, Edadmits, "I held my own.”

Gridders Vie
With State ‘

After failing the elasticity test
as administered by Minnesota, 24-7,
Pitt’s Panthers prepare to bounce
back into the win column against
Penn State.

Coach Joe Bedenk brings his
Nittany Lions to the Stadium for
the final game of the season to give

,Pitt a chance to equal last year’s

6-3 record.
Throttled Nebraska

The Lions, who also have a 5-3
record, will show a strong veteran
line. State’s line has lived up to
the preseason buildup given it. In
the Nebraska game, which State
won, 22-7, the line held the Corn-
huskers to a scant 25 yards gained.

In the backfield, Fullback bran
Rogel and Halfbacks Bill Luther
and Vince O’Bara, brother of Pitt’s
Joe O’Bara, are the scoring potent-
ial of State's single wing attack.
Although a high scoring team this
year with 162 points, the Lions
can't be called the powerhouse that
Minnesota was Saturday.

Enemy Staved Off

Early in the Gopher game, Bill
Bye and Jim Malosky, running and
throwing from behind the giant
Gopher line, presented an ever-
threatening scoring punch that was
consistently blocked by the Pitt
line. For the first 20 minutes of the
game, the Panthers more than held
their own and threatened to score

By DAVE POLLOCK

"The dirtiest team we’ve played all year long."’ That’s what
George Svendsen, ‘Minnesota assistant line coach, said about the

Panthers after Saturday’s tussle.

Svendsen, who scouted Pitt the week before, claims that the

Jungle Cats played the same kind
of ball against Ohio State.

Pitt, outweighed on an aver-
age of 14 pounds per man by Minne-
sota, was penalized a total of 35
yards against Ohio State. Only one
of the five penalties was for more
than five yards, a personal foul
being called against the Jungle
Cats late in the fourth quarter.

Gophers irked

There was no talk about any
rough tacticsin either dressing room
after the Ohio State game. But that
seemed to be the main topic of con-
versation on Saturday, during and
after the game, especially among
the Gophers.

Nick Bo1kovac’s play drew the
most comment from the Minnesotans.
They claim that Nick, one of the
few Panthers that compares with
the giant Gophers in weight, was
slugging all day long.

When Jerry Ekberg, 228-pound
tackle came out of the ball game in
the third quarter with a smashed
lip, he said that Bolkovac had done
It. '

“Biff ’em”

This caused Svendsen to say to
the men on the bench, "Let's go
out there and play a little rough
football with them. Give them that
extra biff when you hit ’em.”

Which caused one of the subs to
yell, "Don’t send anybody in there
without brass nuckles.”

The officials had a busy day
day Saturday. Minnesota was pen-
alized 125 yards and Pitt 45 yards,
with one Panther, Center George
Radosevich, being thrown out of
the game for slugging.

Earl Pummled

On one of Earl Sumpter’s'pass
receptions, he was tackled by
George Hudak who kept beating
his hands into the small end’s face.
Carlisle Dollings, the head lines-
man, warned Hudak, but let it go

Hardisty Denies
Gym Class Story,

Bill (Golden Toe) Hardisty, who
remained out of the Minnesota game
because of a knee injury, told the
Pitt News that reports in downtown
newspapers of his injuring the knee
in a gym class were untrue.

Hardisty said he was sidelined
because the knee, which was hurt
before the season and again in the
Penn and Ohio State games, had
simply refused to respond to treat-
ment.

The big punter offered as proof

the fact that he was excused from ’
gym classes because of the ailm”ent..

Stories alleging a gym class ac-
cident revived talk of the 1947 in-
cident in which Bill Bruno, a Pan-
ther quarterback who was nursing
a bad leg, further injured the bone
in a gym class soccer game. He
was then sidelined for the Notre
Dame ..game, and quite arumpus
followed. A

  N0   Bowl Bid--
90ne Fan’s Glad ‘

By MYRON KOPELMAN
Sports Editor

7 Mr. Budd Schulberg, our business manager, is tickled over Pitt's
, losing to Minnesota. More specifically, he is tickled that the Panthers

Some people are just mercenary
of school spirit and loyalty. So
Schulberg, who handles the money

losing the bid meant a blow to i’itt’s
gridiron prestige, he would not care
to have a sports writer spending
New Year’s Day in some southern
city on his, Schulberg’s, cuff.
Nothing New

However, such a shabby attitude
is nothing new on the part of this
fellow. lie has been casting dark
glances at the sports department
ever since /our Dave Pollock re-

turned from an excursion to the
Pitt—Indiana game.
After skimming over Pollock’s

expense account for meals eaten
on the train, Schulberg was heard

to mutter that it might have been

cheaper to put a motor on Scotty’s
Diner and send off the sports writers
replete with personal chef and all.

It took considerable explaining to
convince the man that meals can-
not be had on a train for the same

writers are instructed to eat locally
in the Schulberg family’s restaurant,
where the special is "Schulberg’s
Italian Spaghetti.”
I Comes Naturally

But I suppose you cannot blame
Mr. S. for being somewhat parsi-
monious with the paper’s money.
Business managers are probably
born with an inherent desire to
make ends meet.

And it seems that this does not
necessarily mean Nick DeRosa and
Ted Geremsky meeting Rice In-
stitute’s ends in the Cotton Bowl

IF ‘Council May
Boost Bimbo
For All-American

Rumor has it that lnterfrater-
nity Council will, in tomorrow
evening’s meeting, consider pro-
moting Lou “Bimbo” Cecconi,
Panther halfback, for All-Ameri-
can honors.

Several fraternities are report-
edly advocating a petition recom-
mending Cecconi. The petition
would then be presented to sports
writers’, in the hope that they will
get behind the gridder.

Since most All-American teams
have already been picked,although
not released, the effort is looked
upon as futile by most observers.-

Irks Fr-osh

The old army song, "Ya Gotta
Get Up,” may be all right for the
army, but the Pitt frosh have no
liking for it.

They have no liking for it, es-
pecially when they have to cater
to it at 6:30 in the morning, and
then play ball at 10.

The Panther first-year men ar-
rived at the Point Thursday night
after 14 hours on a Greyhound bus.
Their traveling arrangements were
made under the impression that they
would play sometime the next after-
noon, but when they arrived they
were notified of a 10 a.m. starting
time.

At 6:30 the following morning
they were hustled out of bed with
the rest of the cadet corps. For
breakfast the frosh were served
fried omelet -- hardly a diet con-
ducive to playing football.

They left immediately after the
meal for the field. But it was the

seemed to,know where the game
was to be played. ‘
When the site was found, it was

Robert Livingston’s PTKA squad
represents the league’s underdog,
whereas the Delts were labeled as

Third and fourth position will be
determined from the outcome of the
Phi Delt-Pi Lam tussel. The Phi

the edge over the surprising Pi Lams.

In the final quarter, as Clayton
Tonnemaker, 246-pound guard, came
back to the bench, he shook his
head and said to Svendsen, “They
take 72 (Bolkovac) out before I can
give it to him.”

Told about this in the dressing
room, Nick said, “That's too bad
about Tonnemaker. He did enough
growling all day long.”

Meanwhile, Bimbo Cecconi was
irked at the Gophers’ tactics. Cec-
coni received a knee in his left
side in a pile-up early in the ball

portion of the second half.

A DU PONT PROCESS CONVERTS
FURFURAL INTO A CHEMICAL
FOR MAKING NYLON

One of the fascinating things about
nylon is the unlikely sounding raw
materials that go into it. Popu-
larly, nylon is said to be made from
coal, air and water. This is because
originally, in developing its chemi-
cal intermediates, chemists used ben-

zene (from coal), ammonia (from air

and water), and oxygen (from air).

But Du Pont is always looking for
new ways of doing things. After the
discovery of nylon in 1934, research
men immediately began looking for
alternative ways of making the two
main intermediates-—adipic acid and
hexamethylenediamine. In 1935,
when nylon was still in the labora-
tory stage and three years before its
commercial debut, they started work
on the possibility of using furfural
in the process.

 

A. G. Sveinbiornsson, Ph.D., Organic Chem-
istry, University of Kansas, 1948, and H. B.
 Copelin, M. S., Organic Chemistry, Cornell,
1941, studying new furfural derivatives.

Furfural has been used in the chem-
ical industry for 25 years, but it is
little known to the layman. A tan-
colored liquid with a faint bitter-
almond odor, it is made from a wide
variety of agricultural by-products.
Among these are corncobs and hulls
of cottonseed , oats, rice—— all available
in practically unlimited quantities
from America’s farms. '

    

C. R. Dewey, B. S. Chem., Niagara Univer-
sity, 1941, and J. M. Estes, B.S. Ch.E., Uni-
versity of Missouri, 1937, engaged in produc-
tion of adiponitrile at the Du Pont Electro-
chemicals plant in Niagara Falls, New York.

‘I4 Years of Research
and Development

It seems a far cry from corncobs to
nylon, and it was. The development
from the first small-scale laboratory
experiments to the present full-scale
plant cost 14 years of time and about
ﬁve million dollars. But it enabled
chemists to produce large quantities
of adiponitrile, the compound from
which hexamethylenediamine is
made, by an economical process
which uses natural materials that
are in continuous supply.

In the new process, furfural is con-
verted by a S‘.‘('leS of steps to 1,4-di-
chlorobutane. The next step explains
in part why Du Pont undertookthe
project in the first place. As pro-
ducers of cyanides, they had sodium

trile plant at Niagara Falls. Here furfural, an

cyanide available for converting the
1,4-dichlorobutane into adiponitrile.

The ﬁnal product, hexamethylene-
diamine, is then reacted with adipic
acid to make nylon "salt.” Still more
processing and the salt becomes yarn,
and the nylon ﬂake used by’ the
plastics industry.

Opportunities at Du Pont
in many scientific fields

This is an excellent example of the
interesting work in industrial organic
chemistry carried on at Du Pont. It
required the technical knowledge and
skill of highly trained research and
development men, including organic
and physical chemists; chemical, me-
chanical, civil and electrical engi-
neers, and others.

Only a large company with ample
resources in men and money could
afford to engage in research of such
magnitude. To the young college
graduate, Du Pont offers the broad-
est of opportunities in many scientiﬁc
ﬁelds, along with the advantages of
working directly with a small group
of associates. 1

Keynote of Du Pont personnel
policy is promotion from within on
a competitive merit basis. A con-

scientious effort is made not only _

to choose college-trained people of
promise, but to develop each indi-
vidual as rapidly as possible.

The pledges will go through a
one-week initiation period climaxed
by a formal initiation ceremony.

Faculty advisor for the new group
is Capt. Allan Sampson, USAF.

The titles of Prop and Wing
officers follow the‘ general pattern
of the RAF. They are Vking Com-
pmander, Clifford Harman; Deputy
Wing Commander, iiarry Graham;
Adjutant, James Sable; Sgt. Major,
\X/illiam Gregory; and Sgt. at Arms,

Transfer
Mixer Set

As a sign that their wandering is
finally over, transfer women and

men will celebrate at a mixer dance

Nov. 17, from 3:30 to 5 p.m.

Men and women of the freshman
class have also been invited to
take part in the dancing and re-
freshments on the 12th floor.

The dance is being sponsored
by WSGA’s transfer committee and
Mens Council and will conclude the
fall program planned to introduce
transfers to the University.

The program for transfer women
has included a dinner at the Hotel
Schenley, four weekly forums which
corresponded to the freshman orien-
tation meetings, and dates for
luncheon and football games with
members of the transfer committee.

Transfer men have had no spe-
cific programof orientation to Pitt
other than this mixer dance.
