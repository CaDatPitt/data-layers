Sexual assault
coordinator
search begins

By Christine Hanna
News Editor

As campus rape becomes more of an
issue on college campuses, Pitt is following
the lead of other universities and creating
an administrative position dealing solely
with sexual assault and rape.

“We’re hoping that by having a sexual
assault coordinator who is very visible and
gets known by students and staff, women
who have been assaulted will be much
more likely to come talk to her,” said Dr.
Robert Gallagher, director of the University
Counseling Center and member of the task

The search will begin for a sexual assault
services coordinator to be recommended
by Pitt’s Sexual Assault Task Force and
approved by Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor in the fall.

The coordinator will be there for the sex-
ual assault victim

Improving conditions of TAs, T Fs focus of student association

By Mike Lyczko
Stuﬂ Writer

The Graduate and
Professional Student Association
is planning a collective that can
bargain to improve conditions
for teaching assistants and
teaching fellows at Pitt.

A report done last year by
GPSA showed that “TAs and TF5
were overworked and have little
power to complain,’’ GPSA
President Steve Parks said. “We
need toform a way to collec-
tively bargain with the universi-
ty. We want to shift the balance
of power to support TAs in their
teaching.”

“GPSA is concerned about the
working conditions for grad stu-

dents,” Mark Smith, GPSA stu-
dent advocate, said. “It has
become an issue around the
country. The debate revolves
around the question of are they
employees or are they students?
This quasi—status leads to misun-
derstanding.” A

Smith said that graduate stu-
dents at the University of
California at Berkeley attempted
to unionize last year and went
on strike over pay and working
conditions.

“As living costs rise and ﬁnan-
cial aid decreases, it becomes

. more of an issue,” he said. At

Pitt, both sides — GPSA and the
Provost’s office —- have done
surveys, which Smith said shows
the importance of the issue.

“The plight of undergraduates
is related to the plight of gradu-
ates,” Parks said. “Without prop-
erly supported teaching assis-
tants, teaching fellows and grad-
uate student assistants, you can’t
improve undergraduate educa-
tion.”

Parks said most graduate stu-
dents aren’t taught how to teach,
and this leads to bad experi-
ences for both undergraduate

‘students and the TAs. While

tuition goes up every year and
students complain about the
quality of education, “money
from tuition increases hasn’t
gone to help TAs, TF5 and
GSAs.,” Parks said.

Even when there are training
programs in teaching for gradu-

ate students, many are too busy
to attend, Parks said, adding that
heavy teaching schedules often
interfere with graduate study.

Parks said things are getting
better for graduate students but
that GPSA is working on further
improvements.“Last year it was
amazing how much [GPSA] got
done. lGraduate students] are
better off because of the [TA]
report,” Parks said.

One goal is to see what kind
of non-teaching fellowships can
be created so that graduate stu-
dents can concentrate on gradu-
ate study rather than teaching.

Parks said last year’s fee
increases for transportation
“demonstrated how little input
graduate students had. The les-

son is to be prepared.”

GPSA members have [ht
background to understand manj ..
campus issues, Parks said _
“What allows us to be successfu 5‘
is that we have students who an
professionals. We have thr:
knowledge, and we’re forming.
the groups to shift policy.”

Parks provided updates Or
other issues from last year.

“We complained about hovw

sity] responded by expanding it
We complained about book

By Matt Groff _
Asst. News Editor

“Pitt is such a big place,
it’s hard to meet people,”
first-year student Brooke
Tilton said as she scanned
the room packed with
sorority representatives.
“It seems like you need to
belong to something.”

Tilton was one of many
first—year students who
attended Meet the Greeks
last night in the William
Pitt Union in an effort to
make the the world of Pitt
a little smaller.

“I wantgto. meet a wide
variety oflpﬁeople, not join
some ‘Barbie—do1l’ group,”
first-year student Nancy
Vasta said. “I’m not sure

this is for me, but ‘I-

thought I'd check it out.”
The Inter-Fraternity
Council and Panhellenic
Association is hoping a lot
of students will be check-
ing out Greek life

between now and Sept. -

13, the first day of Fall
Rush. This year IFC and
Panhel are working joint-
ly to promote Greek life
as a whole, and part of
that effort is to “pump up”
the Greek system and
make a good impressi_on
_on students as the fall
term begins.

“We want to show stu-
dents that the Greeks are

' a strong force on cam-

pus,” IFC Secretary Eric
Scerbo said. “Through
cooperation and working
together we can make
this rush beneficial for the
entire Greek system.”
Scerbo said the 12 days

 between Meet the

Greeks and rush were
meant for students to get
settled and acquainted

S with Pitt before choosing

whether or not to rush. In
the meantime, activities
such as next Tuesday's ice
cream social will keep
Greek prospects
involved.‘ ' _’ "

“This year theice cream
social, is being sponsored
both by IFC and‘Panhel,”
Panhel Rush Chairperson
Marla Zimmerman said.

IFC Rush Chairperson
Fabian Ardila agreed that
there are fraternities “for
anyone and everyone.”
He said he hopes students
realize Greek life is not
about drinking and party-
ing.

BiGALA balances social, pol

By Rebecca Baker
Staff Writer

The Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Alliance’s
agenda this semester will change from
political to social and reach out beyond
campus to include professionals in the
Pittsburgh - community. .

“It’s not definite yet, but we would like to
get a panel of certain professional people
from industry and other careers who are
‘out,”’ said BiGALA business manager Todd
Kinavey.

BiGALA also wants to have more fun
events rather than stress activism;

“The main problem in the past has been
that people came to the group to just meet
other gays and focus on ‘coming out,’ and
they were thrown into activism,” said social

co—chair Evan James. “‘That’s what kept me
away my first semester here.”

“We’re thinking about maybe showing
some movies and having some social events
with themes,” Kinavey said. “Even if we just
bring people in a room with a radio to hang
out, it would be something.”

However, the “big project” for the group,
said James, is a gay prom.

'“There’s a lot of gays and lesbians who
didn’t go to their high school prom and lost
out on that experience,” James said.

‘‘I went to my prom and had a miserable
time,” said former co-president Robin
Poland. ‘‘I hated my date."

Although some of the new officers of
BiGALA said they want to stress a social
agenda, they haven't forgotten about the
group’s traditional political views. —

whether you live

As a political statement, they will have a
table set up in the student union for
National Coming Out Day.

“\X/e’1l encourage students to wear a but-
ton or something like that,” Kinavey said,
“because coming out is not only the
strongest political statement you can make,
but it’s also the strongest personal state-
ment.”

“We definitely still have a political pur-
pose,” Kinavey added, “but our problem [in
the past] was that was our only focus. We
want to find a balance," he said.

Partof that balance includes an open
invitation for heterosexuals to join the
group.

“We’ve always welcomed heterosexuals
to come to the meetings and the activities,”

‘ For T be Pitt News

‘ Some think science courses
should be located in the for-
eign-language section of the
course—description guide. For

others, science is a game that

can be a great deal of fun.

Kathy. Beratan, assistant pro-
fessor in the department of
geology and planetary sciences,
sees her profession as child’s
play, remarking, “Scientists are
-people who haven’t grown up!”

Beratan specializes in sedi-
mentology, which she describes
as the study -of dirt.
“Sedimentology is7the core of
geology,” according to Beratan,
who studies tectonics, faults,
earthquakes and water flows.

Early in her career, Beratan
worked in the jet Propulsion
Lab in Pasadena, Calif. There
she worked with the Magellan,
a satellite on a radar-map mis-
sion to study Venus.

Beratan describes her work in
the Mohave Desert in southern
California as one of the most
exciting projects with which she

has been involved. Among
other adventures, she “got
caught in a flash flood in the
desert  It takes great talent to
be rained out of Death Valley,”
Beratan said with a smile.

Southern California is an
“incredible national lab for geol-
ogists,” Beratan said. Some
rocks in the area are as old as 20
million years, and a lot of the
research is done on a plate mar-
gin. A

Although California has
proven to be a perfect spot for
geologists to do their work,
sometimes one must move on.
Beratan explained the reason
for her move to Pittsburgh as
twofold.\Vhile in California,
Beratan heard of an opening for
a sedimentologist in the geolo-
gy department at Pitt. There was
also an opening in the chem-
istry department for her hus-
band, who also teaches here.

Everyone has to take some
sort of science course to gradu-
ate. Beratan, who will be teach-
ing a course in oceanography
this fall, wants to dispel ugly
myths about science.

Kinavey said. “We have a lot of
straight members who partici-
pate in activities and support us.
In fact, one of our officers is
heterosexual," he said.

However, the vast majority of
BiGALA —— “99 percent” accord-
ing to Evan James — is homo-
sexuaL

“At the activities fair,” James
said, “I was talking to a woman

who came to our table to ask .

some questions and I just natu-
rally assumed that she was
either lesbian or bisexual.

“We want that to change,”
James added. “We want the
organization to be for everyone
concerned about the issue [of
homosexualityl.” ,

But Kinavey said heterosexual
students interested in BiGALA
should remember, “The group

I is not for them but for bisexuals,

gays and lesbians.” _

Heterosexual students who
joined BiGALA in the past often
did so for a class assignment.
“One girl who started coming to
meetings for. a paper ... for, I
think, a sociology class
really involved in the group,”
Kinavey said.

“IStraightl people who have a
friend or relative ‘come out’
often come to us with questions
and for information,” he added.

To protect the privacy of its
members, BiGALA doesn’t
require students to sign their
name to anything, even the
attendance sheet.

“We do ask that they at least

 

 got ‘

put their first name or even an
‘X’ to give us any idea of how
many people there are,” he said.
“Usually wehave around 50 at a
meeting. Sometimes we have
50, at one social we had 70
names on the list.”

If a student wants to give his
or her name to the group, the

names and numbers are kept ‘

conﬁdential.

The university has recently
made improvements to ease life
for Pitt’s gay, lesbian and bisex-
ual students, Kinavey said. The
university counseling center has
offered to help such students
answer questions about their
feelings.

Another improvement on
campus is the domestic partners
program,‘ which extends the
same benefits to same-sex cou-

ples living together as it does to
married heterosexual partners.
The drawback to the new rule,
said Kinavey, is that it discrimi-

nates against unmarried hetero— '

sexual couples. ,

Despite the few improve-
ments, Kinavey said, the univer-
sity administration doesn’t go
“out of its way” to find out
BiGALA’s needs. “We have to
go to them most of the time,” he
said. ‘

ed during or before college.

The position at Pitt, which will be
under the supervision of Gallagher in the
counseling office, will hopefully be ﬁlled
by winter, Rawlinson said.

Oneyear ago a higher education
amendment was passed stating that uni-
versities must publicize the number of
sexual assaults occurring on their cam-
puses; ' —

Because of the Higher Education Act of
1992 and advice from the Provost’s
Advisory Committee on Women’s
Concernsin January of 1995, the task

- force was created.

Chaired by Associate Provost Dr.
Elizabeth Baranger, the committee
researched and went through a series of
steps to see what would beneﬁt the cam-
pus most. , V

The task force strongly felt that the.uni-
versity needed a separate person devoted
to coordinating the programs that Pitt
already “has, directing, helping and edu-

taken.

cating students, according Rawlinson;

lRawlinson said the task force felt that
Pitt needed more than the law required,
so it developed 15 recommendations for
the chancellor. »

Kandy Miller, member of the Student
Health Center and task force, said the
committee outlined a series of steps to be

“Education is one of the primary com-
ponents. A coordinated education
process for the entire university commu-
nity is essential,” M_iller said.

She also said it is essential that one per- _

son be in charge of the services, as
opposed to various ofﬁcesproviding dif-
ferent aspects, so that programs can be
efficient and effective.

Captain Timothy Delaney of Public
Safety, also a member of the task force,
said that this position would give Pitt a
centralized person who would work in
conjunction with the facilities Pitt and
Pittsburgh already have.

Programs offered include: Pittsburgh

Action Against Rape, Center for Victims of
Violent Crimes, Pitt’s Counseling Center,
Student Health Service and Public Safety,
as well as other student organizations.

“lThis position] will onlyvenhance what
we already have,” Delaney said.

Other recommendations include: estab-
lishing a sexual assault help hotline; cre-
ating a sexual assault brochure; creating a
“university-wide protocol for use by all

. members of the university community
_ who may come in contact with victims;”

having an anonymous sexual assault data
form for statistics; continuing to improve
campus safety and security and working
to decrease student drinking.

Rawlinson said the other 14 recommen-

. dations are expected to be approved. ,
“What we’re doing is in the correct

direction,” Delaney said.

“I think the task force worked very well
together. .Dr. Baranger in particular did a
wonderful job. I just hope the recommen-
dations we made are accepted by the
chancellor,” Miller said.

 assault 

Friends, family and public safety officers often cau-
tion women about the preventive safety measures they
should take to avoid being the victim of a sexual
assault. Don’t walk~alone at night. Don’t walk down
dark, secluded alleys. And always be aware of your sur-
roundings. _

On August 14, a woman was raped in Oakland. She

was not walking alone at night and she was not in an '

unfamiliar, deserted area. She was attacked in the mid-
dle of the day, in the middle of her work in a University
of Pittsburgh building.

Sexual assaults can occur anywhere, anytime and.a-
university that is located in an area known for its crime
should take. responsibility and learn how to properly
deal with thevictims of sexual assault. A

Pitt has ﬁnally decided /to take this responsibility and,
following the recommendations of Pitt’s Sexual Assault
Task Force, has created an administrative position
which will focus on sexual assaults and rape. A search
for a coordinator will begin in the fall.

Director of the University Counseling Center and
member of the task force Dr. Robert «Gallagher said,
“We’re hoping that by having a sexual assault coordina-
tor who is very visible and gets known by students and
staff, women who have been assaulted will be much
more likely to come talk to her.”

Often when someone reports a sexual assault they are
treated more like a criminal than a victim. The appoin-t-
ed coordinator will train university offices to deal with
the victims so that this does not occur. Without the fear
of being mistreated, more sexual crimes will be report-
ed, more women will get help and more offenders will
be arrested.

Among other recommendations made to the chancel-
lor is the need for education involving the entire uni-
versity. Also, the coordinatorwill work with other orga-
nizations such as Pittsburgh Action Against Rape. With
a concentrated effort between the university and the
community, a thorough educational system can be
accomplished.

Other recommendations included organizing a sexual
assault help hotline, creating a brochure and develop-
ing a system of protocol that everyone in the university
would be obligated to follow if they came in contact
with a victim. _

Increased campus safety and decreased student
drinking was also stressed.

The chancellor approved creating the position of a

sexual assault coordinator and should also immediately

approve the rest of the task force’s suggestions.

The FBI has estimated that only one in 10 rapes are
ever reported.‘ If this statistic is ever going to improve,
women need tofeel comfortable, safe and entitled to
report any assault. If the university implements all of
the recommendations, more women may ‘feel this way.

KosoVa's tinle bomb ticks away

The centuries—old animosity between Albanians
and Serbs is steadily moving toward open conﬂict
in a region increasingly termed a “powder keg,”
“tinderbox” or “time bomb waiting to explode.” It
is feared that the war in Bosnia will spread south-
jeast to the Serbian province of Kosova (north of
Macedonia and northeast of Albania), long
embroiled in ethnic tensions and economic disas-
ter. 

In the U.S. press, the carnage in Bosnia has
overshadowed the less graphic but no less real
oppression of the almost 2 million ethnic
Albanians in Kosova, who comprise 90 percent of
the population there. For years,

NATO to turn Kosova into “a neutral area under
U.N. control and free from the Serbian Army.”

Although some Kosova Albanians have called
for unification with Albania, both Albanian and
Kosovar leaders generally regard this demand as
too outlandish and are calling only for separation
from Serbia.

Serbia has consistently shown a gruesome dis-
regard for human rights in the former Yugoslavia.
The U.N. Security Council recently condemned
Serbia for pulling Council on Security and
Cooperation within Europe monitors from
Kosova, but the U.N. has not indicated a willing

~ ness to send troops. t

the well-armed Serb minority has
beencarrying out a campaign of

In June, the U.S. House of
Representatives passed Molinari’s

harassment and abuse against . resolutions calling for CSCE and
Albanians, and even now, subtle .  ~U._N. monitors in Kosova‘. The
“ethnic cleansing” is taking place Senate will most likely vote on
in Kosova, where tens of thou- Ferrara these in September, along with a_,
sands of Albanians (most of ’ proposal that would send $5 mil-
whom are Muslim) have been ' lion in humanitarian aid to
intimidated into leaving. Kosova.

Exceptionally_ deep—seated hatred between

’lSerbs and Albanians goes back hundreds of years
, and is nearly impossible to end. Brian Hall, a

journalist who has traveled extensively in
Kosova, wrote that, “Even [Serbs] who managed
to be rational about the Croats and Bosnians
invariably spoke of the Albanians as though their
skin crawled.” Considering the atrocities commit-
ted against Bosnian Muslims, this does not bode
well for any future peace in Kosova.

“The war has alreadyspilled over to Kosova,”
said Kevin’ Tyne, an aide to Rep. Susan Molinari,
R-N.Y., who recently sponsored two resolutions
calling for increased monitoring of human rights
violations in Kosova. “If the’ beatings and murders
in Kosova continue, the Albanians aren't going to
stand for it,” he-said.

Years of injustice may soon push Albanians to
the breaking point. In the past few years, hun-
dreds of Albanian demonstrators have been beat-
en by Serb police. More than 25 Albanians and
Kosova Albanians have been killed by Serbs
along the border between Albania and Kosova
this year, and Serbs have outlawed the Albanian-
language press (provoking a hunger strike this
summer by U.S. and Albanian journalists).
Albanian schools have been closed, and Albanian
professors and students were expelled from the
University of Pristina. "

Ibrahim Rugova, unofficially elected by
Kosova’s Albanians as their president, has many
times called upon the international community to
intervene in Kosova before a war breaks out. He
has asked that United Nations peacekeeping
forces be sent to the region, a proposal applaud-
ed by Sen. Bob Dole, R.—Kan. Albanian President
Sali Berisha has askedlthe United States and

“A lot of people have forgotten about Kosova,
but the situation has gotten a lot worse since the
.. monitors were pulled,” Tyne said. “Oppression
is well under way ltherel.”

President Berisha told the New Yor/e Times that
“an explosion in Kosova will be the beginning of
a real Balkan war.” The West has been wringing
its hands for years about the Balkans, but the
United Nations has a moral imperative to send
peacekeeping forces into Kosova to halt a full-
scale war before it starts, although the conflicts
there are so convoluted that U.N. involvement is
no guarantee for peace.

President Clinton. has promised not to let the
war in Bosnia spread to Kosova, but his lack of
vision concerning Bosnia is an indicator that he
won’t keep this promise. ‘

Kosova is a region heavy with historical impor-

tance for both Serbs and Albanians, and neither is
willing to give the region up. Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic has often referred to Kosova
as the source for Serbian civilization, and a well-
armed Arkan (a Serb militia leader and thug
named Zeljko Raznatovic) is now operating a
campaign of terror out of the Grand Hotel in
Pristina and proclaiming Kosova to be Serbian
land.

Albanians claim they settled the region first and
call for U.N.—enforced independence from Serbia,
which U.S. officials will not support because
Kosova belonged to Serbia before Yugoslavia
broke up. Located in the center of a political
morass, Kosova seems destined to become anoth-
er Bosnia-Herzegovina if the United Nations does
not intervene, and sadly, even if it does.

The sickening “pop” of Tom

T Tumulty’s pectoral muscle was

a sound Pitt football fans ‘didn’t
want to hear about.

. Many grimaced as the news
surrounding Tumulty’s injury
surfaced. He would be lost for

‘the whole 1992 campaign. The

Tumulty was devastated.
Only allowed to hold his right
arm straight for several months,
the person inside the massive
athlete was distraught.

But believe it or not the
awful “pop” came in handy.

' Tumulty worked through his

setback and grew. No, he isn’t
any bigger — he’s more
mature.

_ “The -injury gave me a year of
maturity. I am a year older, and
I look at things differently,”
Tumulty said.

-From the defensive huddle,
Tumulty will l.ook at things
very differently tonight.

"I will be nervous tonight,
but I’m nervous before every
game,” Tumulty said. “It will be
a special game because I get to
play with my teammates again.”

But his return did not come
quickly.

“I waited a couple of months
[after the injury], and then I did
a lot of cardiovascular work,”
Tumulty said as he explained
his rehabilitation. “Then came

Working diligently through
the winter months, Tumulty
slowly started to feel better,
more like himself but a little

Bower said.

“Coming off the season we
had  we were only expected
to win two or three games 
I’m going to be interested in
seeing how we react to the

“I hope they understand that
the most important thing is
what we do on the field [and
not the fact that we’re on tele-
vision].”

While Bower voiced a bit of

wiser.

“I didn’t feel 100 percent
until right before spring ball,”
Tumulty said. “I took avtest for
external and internal strength,
and I knew after that I was
back in shape."

“I’m really excited to play

_ The return of outside linebacker Tom Tumulty brings stability to Pitt's shaky defense.

Pitt will now use the 4-5

Tumulty firmly planted in the

“I really like the attack—style

i TrIURsDA§t,  2,1993

By Heidi Glenn
Staff‘ Writer

It seems that the past and present

career of local sublimators, Swob, has _

been a whitewash of disinformation
and a barege’ of unnecessary and
assaultive obstacles. Between false
allegations of subconscious recordings
and a subsequent apparent fan suicide
(information disseminated last year
about the then unheard and unre-
leased Persis Hussy LP), sour local sup-
port and two secretive departures of
guitarist MC Lingo, the band has finally
decided to continue with its controver-
sial and abrasive style and destroy the
bad guys with psychic warfare.

While it’s obvious that the trio has
reason togtote talismans and feel dis-
paraged, it is momentarily bouncing
back with a successful deal on a
Minneapolis label, Project A-Bomb
Records. “Aviator Dro” will appear on

i an A-Bomb compilation with the Dog
Faced Hermans and God Is My Co-
Pilot. Then a four-song single,
Neutrino, is planned for an early fall
release. Finally, the long awaited full
length (16 songs) CD, Persis Hussy,
will hit stores in March !994 and will be
tentatively followed by a summer tour
with Dog Faced Hermans.

It seems that while there is anticipat-
ed success and worldwide notoriety,
bassist Jon’ Eberle and Drummer Todd
Doehring may be battling a transna-
tional war with San Fransisco authori-
ties, who appear to have lured Lingo
there for an undisclosed sum. While

‘the false information and sweeping
bad luck have propelled the band to
near mythicalistatus, Doehring and
Eberle have vowed to no longer be
consumed with “doomsday” attitudes.
They do not seem to be phased by
Lingo’s departure for they have found
solace in home gardening and land-
scaping. They both said that they’re
sure the matter will be resolved by
summer tour dates.

Fans who have heard the two songs
(Side B) from the Neutrino 7” on
WPTS-FM (98.5) may note that they are
sexy and alluring by Swob standards,
while the first side shines with maturity
of the band’s science-core inner ego.
All four songs (“El Bruto,” “Jaffna b/w,”
“King Is King” and “Recoil”) throb with
systolic dissonance and mangled feroc-
ity. In concept, it combines all the

 

 

paranoia of vulnerability w/the muscle
of instilled Catholic guilt and the chem-
istry between speed and destruction.
For the time being, it appears that
disinformation and dirty politics con-
stantly knit a nasty, legal web for not
only Swob, but also plague local
scapegoats, Wimp Factor 14. This time
the playersin WF are embroiled in not
only their own well—known case
involving their failure to register under
the National Band Name Registration
Act, but also the more recent counter
suit filed by guitarist Gary Miklusek for

“physical and emotional stress” result-

ing from the aforementioned case.

While Miklusek has suffered from
depression, narcolepsy and severe hair
loss, it appears that he’s taking a brief
respite from the band with plans to
“split” for the ‘West after collecting his
“deserved share” from the Justice
Department. -
While neither matter has been suc-
cessfully settled, the members are
enjoying excellent reception from their
14-song, 46-minute Harriet Record
release, Ankle Deep. The Blizzard of
‘95 and three rotating drummers did
not prevent the rest of the band from
recording this testament to the mun-
dane, jaded disillusionment and simple

machines. Produced by Eggs’ Rob
Christiansen (who doubles as one of
the drumming triplets) and featuring
Karl Hendricks Trio’s skin man, Tom
Hoffman, the orchestration is, as usual,
tight and sparse, yet this time more
intricate than previous releases.
Proving that these players are pop
savants, the line up and instrumenta-
tion have changed: front guy Frank
Boscoe (ukelele, zither and vocals),
good-time girl Katie Glicksberg (bass,
clarinet, guitar and vocals), the now
bald Miklusek (guitar, bells and
vocals), recently appropriated Joelle
Levitt (drums and vocals) and blonde
bombshell Rob Washburn (guitar and
bass). The recording of Ankle Deep

‘ was followed by a brief European jaunt

for Glicksberg, Boscoe and Levitt who
were well received by fans in Germany
and gained more hearty recognition for
the band by appearing on a vinyl trib-
ute to songman Daniel Johnston.

I can’t really say if Karl Hendricks
and his bandmates, Tom Hoffman and
Tim Parker, have ever been involved in
government scandals, but it sure does
seem that they have had their share of
lovelorn licks. And it makes me cheer.
It makes me happy, being a girl ‘n’ all,
to know the “other side” of cheesy
romance. With lyrics more enlighten-
ing than a Masters and Johnsons’
report, it’s a revelation knowing that

. while I may be branded a sappy suck-

er, the other half of the population is
not full of arrogant jerks, but rather,
lovesick chumps. Perhaps the Karl
Hendricks Trio’s appeal is somewhat
along the opposite line of the pubes-
cent Bevis and Butthead phenomenon
with a common thread that wails
“familiar soul.” For the boys, it’s the
heavy anchor of quiet, innocent and
most pensive heartbreak. And for the
girls, it’s the palpitating disclosure that
“they” really do care. It’s,not about
beefed—up machismo but rather mak-
ing heartache, crushes, domesticity and
post—coital tears eloquent and brave.
Add to this maturation a painful injec-
tion of noisy Stones and a fistful of
bluesy fuzz, you have the key to the
band’s newrelease,Misery and Women.

This group may make girls swoon
and wish that they were Pittsburgh’s
hottest babes, but then again, will they
end up as new material? With three 7”
under its belt, these three fellows col-

By Allison Hollihan
For T be Pill News

Somewhere in the European
runic, celtic countryside lies a
musical element which com-
bines folk and gothic tapestries.

The (musical incest runs as
thick in these hills as they do in
Austin, T exas.

Ordo Equitum Solis is the lat-
est spawn from the Death in
June, current ‘93 camp. Tony
Wakeford, formerly of Death in
June and currently in Sol
Invictus, has collaborated with

— O.E.S in the studio and. on live

performances.

. Wakeford contributed his
wel-l crafted vocals, guitar
strumming and songwriting to
the first two O.E.S records,
Solstitti Temporis Solis and
Animi Aegritudo.

Residing in the Italian coun-
tryside, vocalist Leithana and
Deraclamo concentrate on writ-
ing songs about the winter sol-
stice, nature and solitude.

O.E.S. creates a mysterious
and magical soundscape by
employing keyboards, harp,
lute, zither, piano, guitars and
percussion. Due to the

medieval instrumental element
and Leithana’s tendency to sing
in Latin and other languages,
O.E.S. has been compared to
the likes of Dead Can Dance
and SPK.

However, O.E.S. prefers a
more minimalistic, -acoustic,
saddening approach.

The latest effort from O.E.S.,
a seven-songmini CD, has a
baroque romanticism that was
less evident in some of its earli-
er efforts.

The band expresses that its
current interest is to produce
music with a simpler, celtic-pro-

gressive folk element which
will be evident in a full-length
album slated for release in late
1993.

Accompanying O.E.S. will be
Detroit’s answer to bands who
refuse to spell correctly, GLOD.

Basing quite a bit of its roots
in magic and paganism, GLOD
reverts to the chaos and
destruction school of tribal

‘drumming, fog, leather and

antics.

‘GLOD is “a mutation of lan-
guage, of multiple meanings
compressed and expressed into

a singular word or sigil — God

Loves Over Dose.”

Fans of 4AD, joy Division,
Dead Can Dance and the lilee,
rejoice.

This is the best thing that’s
hit Pittsburgh since And Also
the Trees says Miss Hollihan
and that ain't no lie no way no
how no chance in, well, no
chance in hell.

O.E.S, GLOD and locals
Thiclehead Grin will be per-
forming this Saturday, Sept. 4
at 7p.m. at the Pitt Student
Union Assembly Room.

Poetic Justice

(Soundtrack)

Menace 11 Society

(Soundtrack)

Well I’m back from chillin’
for the summer and I just had
to listen to some funk while I
was gone. So let me share
with you some of the stuff I
heard.

From one of the summer’s
most realistic movies you have
one of the hardest sound-
tracks, Menace ]! Society. This
album starts off with a bang

- and a “Trigga ( N‘"a) Gots No
Heart” by Spice 1. Spice 1
delivers lyrics about a young
G’s life in the ‘hood over a
phat piano loop.

This jam was one of the first

H hits off the soundtrack. Next
up is one of the summers’
anthems “Streight Up Menace”
by M.C. Eiht ( Compton’s Most
Wanted). Eiht gives a dark tale
of a ‘young G who seems
doomed from the beginning.
Eihts delivery over a hard-core
baseline makes this song a
Jeep classic and, deﬁnitely the

best song on the soundtrack.

then you go straight to Da
Lench Mob and its funk
“Guerillas Ain’t Gangstas.”
This is one of my favorite dips
on the album, just for the two
hooks alone. “l-2-5 I’m a G as
in Guerilla see I’m a killer”
and “Poom—Ping-Ping” are
what makes this song stand

the ladies by a fine one with
Smooth and
Played." Smooth comes with a
style all her’own. With a
combo of smooth lyrics and a
nice voice, she pulls it off.
This is a song the fellas should
pay attention to. 1
Pete Rock and C.L. Smoot

“Death Becomes You.” The

After your hit with those two

Poetic justice. Not as strong as
The Menace soundtrack but it
still ﬂoats.

Well we have solid efforts
from T.L.C., the Dogg Pound,
Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth,
Naughty By Nature, Stevie
Wonder and Stanley Clarke.
They alone keep this sound-
track form sinking, because
without them this soundtrack
would be chillin’ with Charlie
Tuna.

T.L.C. does a remake of the
time classic “Get It Up” that
sets this group on par for
more success to come. T.L.C.
does this remake justice with
phat music and lyrics by Left
Eye. This song seems like it
was made for T-Boz’s voice
(sorry Morris).

The G5 anthem is given to

Zuzu’s Petals
When No Ones Looleing

Twin-Tone

Since most music listeners
don’t know how to deal with
female bands, Zuzu’s Petals, an
all-woman trio from
Minneapolis, will get pigeon-

holed instead of being judged '

as a band.

What are the band members,
riot grrls? No, they don’t sound
as vicious. Grunge chicks? Naw,
they don’t look ratty enough.
Hey, maybe they’re folk rock.
There is acoustic guitars on
their album, and some of the
songs are slow and sad. But
wait, some of the songs are
pretty tough. _ Folk music isn’t
tough. A I  

Zuzu’s Petals takes elements
of each of those styles, but it
fuses them into the group’s
own sound, proving it can’t be
dismissed with a one-word
musical description.

A comparison could be made
between this band and Scrawl
(another female trio) or Salem
66 (where two women lead the
band), but the Petals have more
of an ear for pop than the for-
mer and a harder edge than the
latter.

“Cinderella’s Daydream”
kicks off the album with the
band slamming out a heavy-
waltz rhythm. A retelling of the
old fairy tale princess, from her
frustrated point of view this
time, the song contains one of
the greatest musical hooks of
the year. Guitarist Laurie
Lindeen and bassist "Coleen
Elwood harmonize together
and bring up the band’s pop
edge.

Throughout the album,
Lindeen proves herself a clever
lyricist displaying humor (“God
cries three times a day/she’s
everywhere I look/I wish she’d
go away”) as well as poignan-
cy.

On first listen, slower songs
such as “Johanne” might drag a
little, but further investigation
reveals a fragile, yet beautiful
song.

Although she contributes

’ only three songs on her own,

Elwood also comes off as an
equally capable songwriter.

Her “Psycho Tavern” (which
also appeared with Lindeen’s
“How Long” as a single on
Kokopop) has some quick time
and tempo changes which the
band handles with ease.

In addition to strong song-
writing talents, the members of
Zuzu’s Petals seem as though
they had made a conscious
effort not to stick with one deﬁ-
nite mood or sound throughout
the album.

Volumes and tempos change
dramatically from song to song,
and the trio pulls this off with-

’ out losing any momentum. The

end result is a consistent debut
album. Not something you hear
very often.

Hollana”s
insightful
tell-tale
‘Ga ra’en ’

Aimee DeFoe
Staff Writer

T be Secret Garden

Directed by Agnieszka Holland
Produced by Francis Ford
Coppola

With her adaptation of
Frances Hodgson Burnett’s The
Secret Garden, Agnieszka
Holland continues to prove her-
self one of the world’s most
insightful filmmakers, most
‘notably in her dealings with
children.  ‘ '

Although this Coppola—pro-

~duced picture is intended for

kids, it is a fairy tale full of ten-
sions and truths and sensory
material that even more rigid
adults can enjoy.

After the death of her parents, -

10-year-old Mary (Kate
Maberly) is retrieved at the train
station by the unfathomably
sour-and cruel Mrs. Medlock
(Maggie Smith) and taken to
live at her unc1e’s gloom-filled
mansion.

The formerly spoiled and
impietuous Mary is largely
ignored and left to uncover the
mysteries of the house, includ-
ing a sickly cousin named Colin

who has‘ been hidden ‘ away‘ for‘

the better part of his 10 years
and the forbidden and magical
garden where Mary goes for
comfort.

The combination of Mary's
care and the garden’s power
lifts the spell off the house and
brings life back to its inhabi-
tants.

As in Europa, Europa and
Olivier; Olivier, Holland treats
her child characters with
respect.

Instead of portraying them as
angelic victims who are beyond
reproach or brainless, sarcastic
snots as are the conventions,
Holland’s kids are real people.
She gives them the full range of
human behavior and emotion
and surrounds them with some
pretty hefty themes.

The children in The Secret
Garden are surrounded by
death. Mary’s parents are dead
as is Colin’s mother. Colin him-
self is believed to be on the
verge of dying. .

Rather than emphasizing
these facts as tragic events that
overwhelm the children,
Holland’s child characters seem
to accept it as a part of living in
a way no adult could. To them,
it is something organic and
unavoidable. ’ .

The one major flaw in the pic-
ture involves the evil Mrs.
Medlock.

At the end of the film when
Colin proves himself to be
healthy, she stands at the win-
dow and smiles warmly at him
along with all the other house-
hold help.

This is the same woman who
just hours before was happily
administering shock treatment

to the boy and locking Mary
in her bedroom indefinitely.

Her character is meant to
represent all those adults
who refuse to listen to chil-
dren and treat them as lesser
beings, and her sudden flip-
llop makes no sense.

In the words of my grand-
father, “You can’t tell me
THAT old bitch had a change
of heart.” 3

Other than this, The Secret
Garden is a complete whole
in which all the components

just as sensory experience’
is heightened in childhood,
the visual aspects of the film
exude intensity.

This is most evident in the

sequence of time-lapse pho-
tography and dissolves that
illustrate spring arriving at
the manor in which green
things shoot up from the
ground and flowers bloom
instantly in layer after layer
of lush images.

Most importantly, this film
reminds us of the complexity

Golden Eagle D’ primed

By Jason Brame
Staff Writer

There isn’t much finesse in
Southern Mississippi.

From the stifling 110-degree
days to the breath—taking white
fields of cotton to the
unabashed football hatred
between the three in-state
schools, they do it big or‘ they
don’t do it at all in the deep
south.

You can now include the
Southern Miss defense on that
list.

The Eagles join Ole Miss as
one of the Mississippi schools
with a nationally renowned
defense. Ranked 59th overall
last season, USM returns nine
starters to a squad that has
gained respect across the coun-
try.

“I would be surprised if
[Southern Miss’ defense] isn't
the best defense [we face all
yearl,” Majors said. “They prob-
ably have us outmanned con-
siderably. , I

“They are a very fast defense
and are a very young defense
but real experienced,” Pitt wide
receiver Dietrich jells said. “I
have the utmost respect for
them.” _

The Golden Eagles, who fin-
ished l992 fifth in the country
in turnover margin and eighth
in passing defense, are led by
middle linebacker Tyrone Nix, a
first-team All-South
Independent selection.

Nix led the Eagles in tackles
and solos, recording 137 and
87, respectively. The stay—at—
home linebacker recorded no
sacks, but recovered a pair of
fumbles and had one intercep-
tion on the season.

“He is a very good player and
a very good leader," Majors

said. “We really can’t do any?

thing about how [talented] they
are, we just have to execute.” j

Robinson is junior defensive

Ratcliff and Shaun Gamble will
start at the two safety positions.

USM’s defensive strength is
magnified when you consider
how extremely unstable Pitt’s
offense is. Three factors make
Pitt susceptible to a defensive
blowout.

First, Majors only recently
named his starting quarterback,
John Ryan, after a lengthy battle
between three candidates. Ryan
received spot playing time last
year but has no real experience.

Secondly, the Panthers have
had to put together a makeshift
offensive line, after losing four
of five starters from last year’s
squad.

Finally, Tim Colicchio, Pitt’s
number—two tailback, will not
play in I-lattiesburg due to an
injured shoulder.

This is not good news for an
offense that doesn’t have much
room for mistakes.

Offensively Southern Miss fol-
lows the same credo as many
rugged Southeastern teams —
walk softly and carry a big
stick.

The “big stick” is 300—pound
tackle Todd Beeching. Standing
six—foot—eight—inches, Beeching

for Mississippi rendezvous

is tops on both the height and
weight lists for the Eagles and
gives them an immense run-
blocker. .

The rest of the offense is

solid, if not spectacular, and ;
[0 be»
stronger than the individual '

relies on the chain

links.
Tight end Anthony Owens

supplies raw blocking power

and above-average hands to the

Golden Eagle line.

“His greatest asset is his
tremendous blocking,” Southern
Miss Coach Mike Williams said.
“And after he catches the ball,
he is hard to bring down.”

Tommy Waters returns as the
starting. quarterback in his third
year as a starter. The junior
does not possess the physical
attributes of some other quarter-
backs, but gives the liagles a
steady hand under center.

“I-Ie’s not a really talented kid,
but he knows his limitations,”
Bower said. “In Tommy Waters,
his strength is his intangibles.”

Myreon McKinney highlights
a backfield full of three tail-
backs. Fullback Howard
McGee, a 6’—2” junior, will
block.

last season with mononucleo-

Begor was positive about
Pitt’s chances against Penn
State because the Lions will
give young players significant
playing time and because the
match comes so early in the
Panthers’ schedule.

“If somebody said to me,
‘Coach, you've got to play Penn
State one match this year,
[when] do you want to do it?’ I
would say first match,” Begor
said. “Usually, if you serve and
pass [well] in the first match,
you've got a great chance of
winning. Those are Pitt’s
strengths.”

The competition gets tougher
for Pitt as it takes on national
power Nebraska on Saturday at
1 p.m. Nebraska was 22-6 last
year, losing to Illinois in the
NCAA Mideast Regional. .

“They are one of the top four

or five teams in the country. I
A don’t care who you are, you

will have to play very well to
have a chance to win the

an assistant with the

Pittsburgh.

No one on the team will out-

Tumulty

Continued from page 8

As a rookie, Tumulty was
named Big East Rookie of
the Year, registering a team-
high 11 tackles in Pitt's 1991
opener against West
Virginia.

And last year in Pitt’s
opener against Kent,
Tumulty was having a
strong first half before his
chest injury.

So “Tumulty” and “season

openers” have become syn-
onymous since he donned a
Panther jersey. One for his
play, the other for his injury.

This year, however, will I
be different. .

“It’s going to be a special
game,” Tumulty said with a
smile. “But this year I am
older and I’m back for
good?

Thanks to a lot of hard
work and the “pop.”

  Intangibles k

There is much anticipation
on the University of Southern
Mississippi campus about the
first football game of the sea-
son. There is even more now
that the game will be televised
on ESPN.

Last season, the Eagles
appeared once on television,
beating East Carolina, 58-21.
The anticipation of a big name
school visiting Southern Miss
has students, faculty and staff
in a whirlpool of excitement.

During the 1992-93 season,
USM was picked to be bad.
Real bad. However, the Eagles
surprised everyone by going 7-
4.Many players, coaches and
fans thought it was a good
enough season to receive a
bowl bid. They never got-one.

This season is a different
story. USM returns 16 starters -
and nine on defense. The

“Black Attack” defense was
ranked in the top 10 last year
in defensive passefficiency. It
was the defense that kept the
Eagles close in every game.
Three of the four losses came

Sean
N Murphy

to South East Conference pow-

ers Auburn, Florida and nation-
al champion Alabama, by a
combined 19 points.

Quite possibly, the key to
tonight’s game will be the
intangibles. Temperatures have
held steady between 95 and
100 degrees everyday. The heat
index during the day rises well

‘ over 110 degrees. Not really-
