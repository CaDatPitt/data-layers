Gerry Mulligan and Jeff Martin, '

writers for Late Night with David
Letterman, appeared ”without a
net” in front of a student au-
dience last night in the William
Pitt Union. ,

”-We've always‘ dreamed of
seeing South Oakland. We're
speechless,” said Jeff Martin.

The comedy-writing duo spoke
to Pitt students as members of the
Late Nightstaff, fielding questions
and one-liners from the audience.

"They showed video clips from
various shows, along with offer-
ing their own insights into the

‘ mechanics of writing comedy.

One of the topics that they dis-
cussed was censorship.

”We had an idea for a Rude
Breakfast Cereal. You add milk,

» and it goes ’snap, crackle and f—k

you,’ but that wouldn't flush,”
said Martin and Mulligan. They

also mentioned that sometimes -

they cannot satisfy the censors,
and the shows are not run. ”We
then have to show reruns,” said
Martin. . -

In response to a question from
the audience, Mulligan said,
“The Regulator Guy will return to
the show just as soon as hell
freezes over. Right now, Chris El-
liot is doing a Brando imitation.
He'll continue to do Brando un-
til Brando sees the tape and sues
his ass off.” S - ’

By Michael Blood

Associated Press Writer

HARRISBURG — Difficul-
ties in extracting debris from
the damaged Three Mile Is-
land Unit-2 reactor have led
officials to extend the date for
completing the plant's cleanup
into 1989, a spokesman said
Monday. '-

GPU Nuclear Corp., the
operator of Three Mile Island,
previously had planned to
complete the estimated $1 bil-
lion cleanup by late 1988 and
then place the plant into long-
term storage.

According to a company
statement, most cleanup ac-
tivities, including the removal
of damaged fuel and other
debris from the reactor, are ex-
pected to be concluded next
year, as planned.

However, the company said
the final shipments of debris
from TMI-2 to a federal facili-
ty in Idaho, some work reduc-
ing radiation levels and the
disposal of about two million
gallons of radiation-laced

water will likely extend into

TMI cleanup slow

, thirds of the debris” from the

1989.

GPU spokesman Gordon
Tomb said the revised sched-
ule for completing the cleanup
”reflects the difficulties we've
had in defueling the first two-

damaged reactor.

In late 1986, workers had
problems breaking up a crust
of formerly molten fuel and
debris in the reactor, which
temporarily halted fuel
removal. The problems later
led to a slowdown in the
process. ‘

Currently, about two—thirds
of an estimated 293,000
pounds of debris in the reac-
tor have been removed. Much
of the debris has been shipped
off—site to the Idaho-based fed-
eral laboratory.

GPU said ‘workers now have
cleared virtually all the debris
from the area that formerly
housed 177, I2-foot high, fuel
assemblies. GPU termed the
removal of debris from that
area of the reactor ”an impor-
tant milestone.” About Me-
thirds of the radioactive fuel it-

self has been removed.

Gorbachev arrives in U.S. -

By Terence Hunt
AP White House Correspondent

WASHINGTON — Soviet lead-
er Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrived
Monday for the first time on
American soil, saying, ”we sin-
cerely want better relations” with
the United States and vowing to

. work at this week's summit with

President Reagan for sharp cut-
backs in the superpowers’
nuclear arsenals. ‘
Accompanied by his wife,
Raisa, Gorbachev arrived at 4:33
p.m. EST, at Andrews Air Force
Base in suburban Maryland and
was greeted by Secretary of State

George Shultz and other digni- '

taries.

It is the first visit to the United
States by the 56-year-old Gor-
bachev, and the first superpower
summit in America since 1973.

”We want to assure all Ameri-
cans, we sincerely want better re-
lations between our countries
and our peoples,” Gorbachev
saidupon arrival.

”At the center of our discus-
sions with the president... will be
the pivotal question of ‘U.S.-

Soviet relations  reducing stra-

tegic nuclear arms,” the Soviet
leader added. I
”We are hoping that we will

 

hear some new words on their
side,” he said. ”We will be dis-
cussingother world problems,
too, of course, problems which
are of concern to the nations and
problems of which are awaiting
solution.

”We can neither of us shirk the
role we are to play in world af-
fairs,” Gorbachev added. ”We
must act with the utmost respon-
sibility to our peoples and to the
peoples of the whole world.”

_ Shultz and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
scheduled a two-hour meeting
rMonday night at the State Depart-
ment to prepare for their leaders’
talks. -

Reagan and Gorbachev will be-
gin three days of talks atthe
White House Tuesday and sign a
treaty to abolish intermediate-
range missiles from the super-
powers’ arsenals.

A huge security force was in
place to protect the leaders.

With the INF treaty nailed
down, there were hopes for
progress for a more important

agreement to cut strategic nuclear .

missiles, the most deadly

weapons, by half. '
”We think this summit is of

crucial importance. We think we

disarmament,” said Gennady

Gerasimov, the Soviet Foreign '

Ministry spokesman. He added,
”We have great expectations,
and we think‘ it will be a
success.”

Asked if Gorbachev planned to
spring any surprises on Reagan,‘
as he did at their last summit in
Reykjavik, Iceland, Gerasimov
said, ’’I don't want to pre—empt
the dialogue. But you know, he
is a man of surprises."

Reagan, during a picture-taking
session as he was commencing a
meeting at the White House with
his.military joint chiefs of staff,
talked in glowing terms of the INF
treaty.

”I’ve always said I'd rather .

have no treaty than one that
doesn't add to our security and
that of our allies,” he said. ”The
INF treaty meets that test; it's a
solid accomplishment for the
United States and our allies.”

Reagan said that in addition to
signing a treaty ”that will
eliminate an entire class of offen-
sive nuclear missiles, I want to
use the summit to move forward
in other areas.”

The president said he wants an
agreement" on
weapons, ”but only if it's a good

 

long—range .

“can begin onthe road to,.nuc.|.ear - W189.sss-$Wti*e.i.P?8e*4. : I

Wilkinsburg citizens want outside records’ help

WILKINSBURG, Pa. — Follow-
ing allegations of wrongdoing in
the management of Wilkinsburg’s
finances, a citizens group wants
independent advisers to help
borough officials keep proper
records.

”We are not going to stop un-
til something has come out of
this,” Sylvia Lafranchi, a member
of the Wilkinsburg Citizens Coor-
dinating Committee, said Sunday.

State Auditor General Don
Bailey on Friday released the
results of a five-month audit and
requested criminal investigations
of what he called corruption and
fiscal mismanagement.

The audit cited the absence of
receipts, double payments to ven-
dors, unauthorized spending, vio-
lations of bidding procedures and
payments in advance of receiving
goods and services.

”|t's alblack eye for Wilkins-
burg, but I am glad it is all com-
ing out,” said Councilman

Bernard McKenna. ’’I honestly
feel we need a grand jury inves-
tigation.”

Wilkinsburg, bordering Pitts-
burgh on the east, faces a year-
end deficit that borough officials
estimate will be $585,000 but
which state auditors said will be
higher. .

High court deals blow
to cigarette makers

WASHINGTON — The Su-
preme Court Monday rebuffed an
effort by cigarette makers to limit
public access to information used
in lawsuits over the alleged
dangers of smoking.

The court, without comment,
left intact a ruling that allows peo-
ple suing the manufacturers to
share the information with others.

The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Philadelphia ruled in
June that the companies failed to
prove making the information

public would cause them finan-

cial harm.

The appeals court upheld a rul-
ing by a federal judge in New Jer-
sey who said the manufacturers’
business documents, under cer-
tain conditions, may be used in
related or similar cases and may
be disclosed to the public.

There are at least 100 such
lawsuits pending nationwide
against tobacco companies.

The case acted on today in-
volves the late Rose Cipollone of
Little Ferry, N.J.

She smoked for 40 years before
quitting in 1982 after her right
lung was removed. She died in
1984 of cancer. Her husband,
Antonio, continued her .1983
lawsuit against three cigarette
companies: Liggett Group lnc.,
Philip Morris Inc. and Lorillard
Inc.

While a part of the case was
dismissed, a trial on remaining is-

sues in the product liability suit
is scheduled to begin in January.

Those suing have said the
cigarette manufacturers failed to
warn smokers adequately about
the risks, and when health warn-
ings did appear on cigarette pack-
ages beginning in 1966 they
were negated by advertising that
promoted cigarettes.

The cigarette companies also
are accused of failing to test
cigarettes adequately and of sup-
pressing information on the
dangers of smoking.

Smith scores 34 as 
Panthers dominate  
Chicago State, 89-63:  

By John Enright
Editor in Chief

Charles Smith has scored over
1,500 points and counting as a
Pitt Panther and he scored over
1,400 points at Warren Harding

High School in Bridgeport, Conn. [

But he never scored more than
30 points in a game since, uh,
since 

”Elementary school, but what's
that?” said Smith.

The Pitt basketball media guide
says Smith once scored 37 points
in a high school game, but so
what.

That's in the past. Smith's only
concerned with the present.

”I’m trying to play with more
enthusiasm every night. That was
one of my weaknesses in the past.

I didn't come to play in my mind‘
and I slipped out. of the game

sometimes. I have to get to the
point that I come to play every
night,” said Smith. -

Last night Smith came to play.
No doubt about it.

He scored a Pitt career-high 34

points, pulled down 10 rebounds ~

and swatted away four shots,
leading the Panthers to an 89-63
win over Chicago State at. Fitzger-
ald Field House before a sell-out
crowd of 6,789. _

And Smith did it all in only 28
minutes of playing time.

Pitt, ranked second in this
week's Associated Press poll, is
3-0. Chicago State dropped to
1-4.

”|’ve_ always been a team play-
er, but this year I really have to
put forth an effort and take con-
trol when things aren't going
well. I didn’tblook to pass early in
the second half when we were
lackadaisical. I tried to put [the
ball] up and go to the hole,” said
Smith. ,

In the second half Smith scored

Lady Panthers claw;
Lady Bobcats 71-69;

The Pitt Lady Panthers defeat-
ed Ohio University 71-69 last
night at the Fitzgerald Field
House for their third win in five
games.

Ohio fell to 3-1.

”Anytime you win, it's good,”
said Pitt head coach Kirk Bruce.
”I expected a letdown. It's a clas-
sic phenomenon. We played our
hearts out against Penn St [a
73-71 loss last Saturday night],
and we had to come back after
that game, which wasn't easy. A
lot of our girls were tired tonight
[last night].”

Pitt's Jenelle Lantagne was re-
cently named Big East Freshman
of the Year in women's volley-
ball. It was a well-deserved ac-
colade for the first-year setter
from California.

Upon graduation from San Die-
guito High School in San Diego,
Jenelle decided to further her
education at the University of
Pittsburgh. This decision came
about as a direct result of a con-
versation between Pitt coach
Shelton Collier and Kathy

,_C-regory, coach from the Univer-

sity of California at Santa Barbara.

Gregory, who is a, friend of the
Lantagne family, informed Colli-
er about Lantagne’s playing abil-
ities, and the Pitt coach was
immediately interested.

Lantagne remembers her
thoughts when she was being
recruited by Pitt: ”I didn't think
of Pitt as a place to go. But, I
came out here for a visit, and I
liked it a lot.” _

For his part, Collier has not
regretted recruiting Lantagne for
a minute. ’’I am impressed with
Jenelle for several reasons. Num-
ber one, she is a real good volley-
ball player.

”Secondly, I think she thought
that she would be the starting set-
ter. When she was beaten out by
senior Louise O’Shaughnessy,
she handled playing second
string very well. Jenelle shows a
lot of, class and maturity for a
talented young player,” said
Collier.

Jenelle came to Pitt with very
little knowledge about the Lady
Panthers. ’’I wasn't sure how
good a team Pitt would be. I had
only seen them practice for a half-
hour prior to my arrival for
preseason workouts. I wanted to
earn a starting position on the
team. And I wanted our team to

THE /PITT NEWS, Tuesday, December‘8, T987

qualify for the NCAA tournament
because everyone in the country
respects a team for accomplish-
ing that,” recalled Lantagne.

”She is a key player and is one
reason why we were so success-
ful this year. There was a time
when she was starting; later she
was not, but in both situations,
she was a real good team player.
Jenelle has fit in very well and is
a [model] Pitt player.”

Jenelle’s selection as Big East
Freshman of the Year was icing
on the cake for a memorable first
year. ”I was really excited when
I was selected! It is pretty special

Lantagne hopes to build from freshman year

because some freshmen play
more on other Big East teams be-
cause their teams are not as
talented as ours,” said Lantagne.

Coach Collier feels confident
going into next season with
Jenelle as his starting setter. ”This
year, she had a part-time role.
Next year, she will take the set-
ter position over from Louise
[O’Shaughnessy], and she will
keep us as successful as we have
been in the past. I really feel our
freshmen class this year consist-
ing ofjenelle, Michele Adamson,
Linda Zols and Shelly Seanor is
one of our best ever,” noted
Collier.

Swimmers stay afloatduring Pitt Invitational  

By Kelly Witt

Staff Writer

The men's and women's swim
teams hosted the Pitt Invitational
at Trees Pool this past weekend.

The teams in attendance were
Texas A&M, Miami of Ohio,
West Virginia University, Penn
State, Clarion University of Penn-
sylvania and St. Bonaventure.

The Pitt women's team placed
fourth with an overall score of
501 points. They were beaten by
Texas A&M (761.5 points), Mia-
mi of Ohio (674 points) and Penn
State (608 points).‘ ‘

Head coach David Belowich

said he was pleased with the
swims of freshmen Liz Sari,
Theresa Picklo, Celeste Makiel
and Rachelle Stauffer.
. Picklo took seventh in the
1,650-yard freestyle with a time
of 7:31.49. Sari placed eighth in
the 500- and 1,650—yard freestyle
and was a member of the fourth-
place, 800-yard freestyle relay
team.

Makiel, another member of the

relay, came in sixth in the 100- _

and 200-yard freestyle events
with times of 54.04 and 1:56.07,
respectively.

Also in the relay with Sari and
Makiel were Tricia Rickert and

Marian Cassidy.

Belowich remarked that Cassi-
dy and Cindy Rose, the team's
co-captains, did a good job all
weekend, also.-

Cassidy placed fifth in the
400-yard individual medley with
a time of4:37.18, as well as sixth
in the 200-yard backstroke and
the 500-yard freestyle.

Sophomore Sandy Albright
took third in the 100-yard back-
stroke, and Cassidy took sixth.

Rose took fourth place in the
50-yard freestyle with a time of
24.25, and Laure Walczak took
seventh with a time of 24.44.

Diver Tricia Ney won both of
the women's events. ”The wom-
en's field was tougher overall
than the men’s,” said diving
coach Julian Krug.

Junior Margie Paulick placed
third on the 1-meter event on
Saturday. ”On Friday, Margie
had an off-day," said Krug, ”but
her third-place finish on the
1-meter was a good indicator that
she just had a bad day on
Friday.”

Sophomore Candy Yackmack
qualified in eighth place on the
1-meter board. ”She did an excel-
lent job in the finals to move up
to fifth place," said Krug. Similar-
ly, freshman Kim Strawbridge

moved from eighth to sixth on the
3-meter board.

’’Overall, 1 look to the divers
continuing to be a very strong
part of the swim teams,” said
Krug.

The Pitt men's team came in
second with a total score of 618
points. Texas A&M came in first
with 840.

’’All in all, it was a great per-
formance from these guys,” said
assistant coach Bob Clemmer.
”They’re used to being rested be-
fore a big meet, but we've been
doing a lot of different things this
year.”

Sophomore Charlie Fry won
the 500- and 1650-yard freestyle
events and broke his own meet
records in both. He broke the
500-yard freestyle record of
4:33.97 with a time of 4:30.63
and the 1650-yard freestyle of
15:45.51 with a time of 15:44.27.
Senior co-captain Charles Lersch
took third in both events.

Senior co-captain Jim Emore
placed second in the 100-yard
butterfly with a time of 49.34 be-
hind Texas A&M's Mike Varozza
who had a time of 49.11. Both
men broke the previous meet
record of 49.44 held by Emore.

Emore placed second in the
200-yard individual medley with

1 12-70 loser at Pitt last year, was
led by guard'Kenton Terrell with
17 points.

StanleyJones scored 11 points
and Willie James added 10 for
the Cougars.

Pitt, which had been outre-
bounded in its first two games,
beat Chicago State on the boards,
47-27.

Lane finished the game with 16
rebounds, 11 in the first half.

Freshman guard Jason Mat-
thews added 14 points for Pitt,
while Lane had 13.

”Our rebounding was good
and our teamwork was good. The
only negative is we missed a lot
of easy shots,” said Evans.

Smith said the Panthers are im-
proving every day, but they still
have a long way to go.

‘ ”We played real hard the. first
half. The second half we were lax
the first six minutes  we have

to get to the point we play hard,

40 minutes.”

Pitt's four freshman played 98
minutes combined. Point guard
Sean Miller came off the bench
and played 28 minutes. He
scored six points and handed out
four assists.

Six-31/2 guard Darelle Porter
played 30 minutes. He scored
only four points, but had a team-
high seven assists.

”lThe freshman] are a lot more
comfortable. I have confidence in
them, but they have to have the
confidence in themselves,” said
Smith.

PANTHER NOTES: Pitt's next
game is Saturday afternoon
against West Virginia in Morgan-
town. Game time is 2 p.m
