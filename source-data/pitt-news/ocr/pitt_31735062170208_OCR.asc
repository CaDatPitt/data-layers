The latest operation on the body-admin-
istrative has been the voluntary amputa-
tion of Bill Markus, assistant dean of stu-
dents and coordinator of Academic Af-
fairs. Before he formally leaves today to
set up his own placement business in Pitts-
burgh, Markus threw out a few random
thoughts about his relations with students
over the last two years and what trend he
believes the student movement is taking.

Students want a co-participatory role
in the University community, proposed the
youthful ex-dean, but this implies respon-
sibilities as well as rights.

“You may not agree with me,” he con-
tinued, ‘‘but IE still feel that control im-
plies accountability. With the power flow
from the Board of Trustees through’ the

Chancellor and the Deans, we have this at U

some point. Decision-making should be
shared, but you can’t say that a group is
held accountable. The buck must stop some-
where. The dilemma is where.”

Pressed for time because he had to at-
tend yet another meeting with students in
his continuous schedule, Markus stopped
long enough in his office on the 12th floor
of the Cathedral to offerhis impressions
of the student fight for control.

“I have a general feeling of frustration
about what’s going on. I am not completely
philosophically in tune with what’s happen-
ing in the big campus picture,” he admit-
ted. “It’s to a lesser degree at Pitt than
what you read in the newspapers. While I
applaud the quest for change, I deplore the
means.”

Markus is convinced that the rational
method of solving problems is “what we
must go back to.” He is’ also convinced that
the administration and the faculty are now
ready for it. -

“I’m sure thatthe administration-and
the faculty are reading with horror what’s
going on on other campuses. An awareness
has been pounded in.” Although he believes
that a University cannot be “all things to
all students,” he feels sure that great
strides have been made here in involving
students in the decision-making process.

“But from where I stand,” he went on,
“it is difficult to say how fully involved stu-
dents can become in this process. There
has to be a dialogue. We have to break-
down the barriers of nomenclature of ‘I am
a faculty member. So think of me in terms
of the classroom.’ A teacher should loosen
his tie and share life experiences on a more
equal footing with students. In thegpnbgnfor
example.” ' ’

Bill Markus views himself as be de-
parts from the University as “a young man
who sees an opportunity for change.”

 

The University Men’s Glee Club,
under the direction of Phillip Cav-
anaugh, has recently returned
from a successful tour of north-
eastern United States. The tour
covered four states: Pennsyl-
vania, New York, -Connecticut,
and Massachusetts.

The Club beganits tour with a g

joint concert with the women at
Misericordia College in Wilkes-
Barre, and then traveled to Pough-
keepsie, N. Y., to perform for Vas-
sar. While in New York. they also
performed for the West Point
Military Academy.

According to Gary Cummins,
president of the Glee Club, the
highlight of the tour was the per-
formance of Faure’s Requiem with
the Boston University Symphony
and the Boston University Wom-
ens’ Chorusgin Marsh Chapel, Bos-
ton. Following a‘ stop in Norwalk,
Conn., the Club returned to the
University campus.

Earlier this year, the Men’s
Club appeared at the University of
Virginia, Wilson, and the Univer-
sity of Indiana, as well as at
several home performances.
Throughout the past two years,

the Club has entertained over 30,- _
» .000"-.people< from; the-.-i~.A,tIa'nticv}to5 iv. »

 

the Mississippi. Plans are now be-
ing made to send the group over- .
seas for a foreign tour.

‘ Next year’s concert tours will
include the Philadelphia, Wash-
ington, and Miami areas. Also in
the Club’s plans is a tour of Pitts-
burgh high schools in cooperation
with the admissions office of the
University.

with hopes and fears. But
only with the truth in so far

Staff News Writer
David W. Ginevan, present director of
housing, is leaving the University today to
begin a placement agency in downtown

‘Pittsburgh in partnership with William

Markus. An undergraduate at Pitt for two
years, he transferred out to return in the
fall of 1965 as head resident of Tower B,
also acting as assistant director of hous-
ing under the Dean of Men’s office.

During the fall, 1966, Ginevan was
appointed assistant dean of men and in
March, 1967, he became director of the
newly created Office of Housing with jur-
isdiction over all residence halls.

Ginevan is known by many as the man
whose signature is‘ at the bottom of all
dormitory contracts, remembered by some
as the man supporting Bill Peterson’s dis-
missal, and b'y_others as the man adminis-
tratively in charge of Saga Food. ‘

There are other things, for which he
may be remembered. "During his year of
administration, a revised social code and
curfew system was effected, the selection
procedure for Resident Assistants was re-
vised to include more comprehensive per-
sonal interviewing of all applicants. The
housing staff orientation and retreat was

instituted and plans for the new dormi- _
..tory complexwere drawn up by a com-

mittee of interested students in conjunc-
tion with Ginevan’s office.

Reflecting on the changing role of the
housing administration during his involve-
ment, Ginevan noted‘ that “it has always
been conservative in its policy-making,
but liberal steps are being taken in the area
of student self-determination and self-reg-
ulation.”

Projecting into the future, Ginevan
foresees a decreasing regulatory function
to be performed by the Housing Office, as.

Regarding hisown position in relation ‘

counteractthe administrative image.” He‘:~jii‘.’-'_.j
stated his surprise, however, “at the over-ff‘

.:lnio Reforms That

by PAUL R. SEBASTIAN
Graduate School of Business

 (Editor's Note: This is the first of a two part article
idiscussing methodology for change at the University.)

A AT THE RISK OF BEING shut off during the
 first paragraph, may I propose a different more
positive alternative and pose a few questions con-
.,cerning the methodology of making change? The
awareness and social concern manifests a certain
quality of greatness in our students—yet is our stu-
,.dent activism for real? Is it deep and lasting or are
i we rebels with neither cause nor direction? Will it
fjcreate permanent long run change or will the old
'1‘ familiar pattern take place? That is as students do
"everything to destroy the system, but once in the
world and with a secure job and a few bucks in your
._—pocket join the system and be as resistant to change
{as the guy next door in yoursuburban neighborhood.
 Are we out to destroy the entire system including its
_.good aspects or is it preferable to constructively
 reform? Can we accomplish more by being positive
’ ban by being negative? Can we accomplish more by
 being positive than by being negative‘? There is no
‘argument about the need for change—but are we
properly channeling this tremendous energy?

 ,One can say revolution—destroy the system
._without knowing what to put in its place. Unless
change is deep and basic attitudes are changed,
-[nothing is accomplished except to replace one ty-
' ranny with another. History has proven this too of-
ten.) Long run change comes through calm discus-
sion, objective analysis, dialogue with all segments
of the establishment, constant promotion, selling
your ideas, and educating the public. Wouldn’t it be
wiser to first gain the best education and prepara-
tion possible, organize your thoughts, analyze ob-
r— jectively all points of view, join the system for
[awhile and learn all its angles? Maybe the system
;has some aspects worth keeping. Anyhow for the
__ time being we've got to live with the system. Then
1 one (anyone) can rise up to be a leader in the sys-
_em and be in a real position to create change.

V’ Rise to a position where you can sell your com-
pany on fulfilling its reponsibilities to the commun-
 ity while meeting its primary goal, profits—not be-
".--cause “if we don’t they’ll burn down our plant” but
because business as members and leaders of the
community has this obligation. Sell an idea of David
« Rockefeller (of all people) “citizens first, business-
: men second.” Abetter community is a stronger
business. Can't be done? If you and others like you

PART

Appalachia or near a ghetto. Besides giving money,
get your company involved in assisting small busi-
ness, giving summer and part time jobs to needy
students, cooperate with school science programs
and community projects with manpower, advice,
materials, etc. .

WHAT ABOUT CHANGING attitudes by teach-
ing in the ghetto or in a suburbian high school or
forming the future corporate executives by teach-
ing at a business school? Paul Stoller called his four
years at Pitt a waste of time. I challenge him and
others like him to get their Ph.D.’s. Then come-
back and show Pitt professors how to teach. Then
four years at Pitt won’t be a waste of time for the
class of 1975. Or will Paul Stoller be like a lot of
other professors—a- great student activist but a

bland, uninspiring, and mediocre instructor, who

can only teach his students to maintain the status
quo and join it all.

There are other critical professions besides ed-
ucation that make change‘—government, journalism,
entertainment, social work, labor relations, etc.
Instead of being doctors, dentists, and nurses who
work with “cases,” be one that can return the per-
sonal touch and element of dedication to the health
professions. If a doctor only wants the $35,000 per
year 9-5 job and cannot see himself as a servant,
he’d better resign from the AMA monopoly and do
something else. '

At the risk of being too idealistic—when social
work is dehumanized to the point of care without
concern and giving without love, millions of dollars
is shot to hell. How about somebody by his perform-
ance show how social work can be made into a pro-
fession instead of just a 9-5 job. One more dedicated
social worker is change, especially one who can give
the hopeless the necessary confidence to contribute
to society instead of being degraded wards of the
state. Change starts with you, buddy.

NOW WHAT ABOUT all the little things done
everyday that nobody hears about which indeed add
up to significance when done continuously over a
period of time? Despite the many faults of our great
nation, we have more outlets for reasonable dissent
and protest without license than most if not all coun-
tries of the world. Basically the principles of our
system are sound, although as in any human system
we certainly have our share of abuses to clean up.
Then what about letters to the editor, writing maga-
zine articles, becoming an influence in the many
community. organizations? Elected officials and TV

sponsors can be very sensitive to letters from the A I

public, for and against. Quality needs encourage-
ment, especially when the going gets rough. Per-
haps your encouragement can persuade a qualified
man to run for publicoffice. . '

It You Drive, Don't

College Press Service

A recent experiment designed
to test the comparative effects of
alcohol and marijuana on driving
performance has shown grass the
winner in nearly every category.
The research was reported in the
current issue of Science magazine.

The "test, run in Seattle, Wash.,
by the state’s Department of Mo-
tor Vehicles and medical profes-
sors from the University of Wash-
ington, measured the responses
of individuals intoxicated with al-
cohol, high on marijuana, and in
normal condition. The subjects,
who were tested repeatedly over a
period--of weeks to prevent error,
were placed inside a driving sim-
ulator which shows movies of
driving situations and measures
the speed and strength of their re-
sponses to the films.

The simulators, the Motor Ve-

hicles department says, will soon ..

replace standard driving tests for
Washington applicants for driv-
ers’ licenses. The machines, an
official says, “Test the quality of
a person’s driving — not just
whether or not he avoids viola-
tions.”

. The test-subjects, were meas-

S ured for steering errors, use of
, turn signals at the wrong time,
, speedometererrors’, and total er-

I'0l'S.

' ‘$5 -

In every case, and after repeat-
ed tests, drivers who were under
the influence of alcohol made sig-
nificantly more errors in all the
categories except steering. Driv-
ers who experienced a “normal so-

cial marijuana high” made more ’

speedometer errors than the
others, but in all other areas
their driving was exactly like that
under normal conditions. They
also made the same number of to-
tal errors as “normal” test sub-
jects.

Speedometer errors, according
to the article in Science, do not
mean driving too fast, since the
simulator machines “drive” at a
fixed speed which the driver can-
not change. Speedometer errors,
the researchers say, “are related
to time spent watching the speed-
ometer.” The research state-
ment also says the relationship
between speedometer errors in
the simulator and bad driving is
less clear than between the other
errors and bad driving. '

It‘ is impossible to tell, from the
fact that a driver made “speedo-
meter errors,” the article goes
on, whether drugs would alter the

"speed at which a person _would

normally drive. But the research-

ers say they have reason‘ to be_- - .'
lieve that driyers “high” on mar-g ,
ijuana would drive more slowly ,

than normally, rather than faster. _

Pitt News Editor Praised

 

H; Mr. Tiernan,

1‘ “Say Something, It is Your Right” in the recent issue.
' of The Pitt News was just the boot in the ass that I needed.
I have, finished by sophomore year at the Johnstown cam-
 pus and intend to come downtown this fall. My thoughts

" perience at Richland, and I have come to the sad conclu-
sion that I virtually wasted my first two years of college
(outside of “credits earned" of course).

My one personal regret is that I did not say anything
before this. I thought there was something wrong with me
that I did not quite fit into the utterly drool classes with
is junior-high level teaching, featuring the classic little old
,' lady with the bun in the back and a watch on her necklace.
" My attitude was typical: “that’s ‘just the way it is." Like
_ many other students, I felt guilty that I did not work hard
' at courses I knew to be easy. Lately, I have come to real-
ize how lucky I was that I did not succumb to such medio-
‘crity.
' Regardless, I did not write this letter to cry on your
' shoulder. I do not intend to let the last two years be like
the first. Next to finding out some loose-minded girl is in
love with‘ me, hearing about the self designed major pro-
gram and the exchange courses was nothing short of beau-
_tiful; I intend to take advantage of both (or all three). In
the meantime, if it is not too much trouble, I sincerely
 wish you would give me some information about partici-
V pation in the newspaper, Undergraduate Council, SG, or
 other related student organizations so that I might help
 clean up this den of hypocracy. ‘

Pitt News Editor /Criticized

Editor, The Pitt News,

I was very much disturbed by one sentence in your
critique of Professor Lawrence Lee’s recently printed
speech. You say that you can understand why some peo-
ple may not condone “confrontation politics.” Then you
say: “But can't he (Lee) understand that the radicals and
their liberal followers believe in what they are doing. and
that they merely want to improve the country for the ma-
jority?" ,

I find in your statement—in its tone and in its con-
tent—a surrender of intelligence and an abdication of re-
sponsixility. I have never heard that the intensity of one’s
belief has anything to do with the rightness of that belief.
I have no doubt that campus radicals sincerely believe
that they are right. However. determination of the right-

‘ ness or wrongness of any idea does not come from testing

the sincerity or quality of belief of the holder. For exam-
ple. I think that it is quite clear that Adolf Hitler was ab-
solutely sincere in his desire to destroy all the Jews in
Europe; I also believe that Josef Stalin was just as sin-
cere when he exterminated about 20 million “problems."
Nobody can doubt the sincerity of Dwight Eisenhower;
but he made the commitment to Vietnam. Neither can
anybody doubt the sincerity of Lyndon Johnson, who want-
ed to “nail the coonskin to the wall" ; and he got us in deep-
er. I don't think there is any doubt that Richard Nixon is
an opportunist of the first rank. without one ounce of sin-
cerity in his body; but I do believe that he will get us out of
Vietnam—if Ho Chi Minh doesn‘t ask too high a price.

I think that a careful study of history will probably
show that the great terrorists. the great murderers. the
great Inquisitors, the great Nay-Sayers to life were all
sincere. In fact. I am convinced—-though _I will listen to

.21 centrary °PiF‘i°',l"?ll?‘,t What We. Ca.1!.the rr!.i1.i.t*‘.r..v-indus-T   

     
 

trial complex is just as sincere in its encouragement of
the arms race as anybody opposed to it-

I think that the weakness of your statement is ob-
bious: it substitutes emotion for intellect; it approves
ends that are dangerously close to,_ dictatorship (“they
merely want to improve the country for the majority”
sounds very much" like a minority control of the major-
ity); worse, it does it with an unmanly, sniveling tone
(“But can’t he understand .' . .). ‘What you have failed to
see, I believe is that sincerity is no excuse for a man’s ac-
tions. Lee Harvey Oswald, Sirhan Sirhan, and James Earl
Ray have one thing in common: they all believed intense-
ly in their own rightness, and they sincerely believed that
their actions would make the world better for everybody.

At this moment in history, I believe that we need few-
er fanatics and more men of reason. We need fewer men
who believe that they are right and more who are willing
to say that the other fellow. is right. We need fewer sincere
men and more intelligent men, more understanding men.
Asincere fool is no less a fool for his sincerity.

- Mon Valley Passer

Head football coach Carl DePasqua announced earlier in
the week that John Hogan has accepted a football scholarship
and will attend the University next fall.

During his three seasons as quarterback at Mon Valley Catholic
High School, Hogan passed for more than two miles of yardage. The

6-0, 183-pound signal-caller
completed 326 passes in 627
attempts for 3,964 yards and 36
touchdowns in his three seasons.

Last season, Hogan hit on 138
of 235 pass attempts for 1,-
645 yards and 23 touchdowns. The
small Catholic League school fin-
ished 6-4 under his leadership.
That was the first winning season
in the school’s ten-year hisotry.

Hogan’s biggest game of his ca-
reer was against McKeesport Ser-\
ra last season when he completed
20 of 27 passes for 323
yards and six TDs. Hogan was also
Mon ValIey’s kicking specialist,
handling the punts, kick-offs, and
extra-point placements.

“He’s the type of athlete we .
have to have to compete with our
schedule,” said DePasqua.

Hogan will be a quarterback
with the West All-Stars in the Big
33 game at Hershey in August. He
was also named to All-Sate hon-
ors.

Hogan was also elected in a poll
of coaches to the Post-Gazette’s
All-Catholic teams as a junior and
a senior.

The strong-armed quarterback,
who lives in Charleroi, selected
Pitt from among some 30 colleges
that sought him. Hogan was also a

ball at Mon Valley High School.
