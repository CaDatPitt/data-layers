Exam Change Definite  

For Department Finals

The Registrar’s Ofﬁce has announced that something
new has been added to the regular examination schedule.

E. A. Batchelder, registrar, says that a special day has
been set aside to administer departmental examinations
whereby students in each section of a certain course will be

tested at the same time.

Pl1i"Beta Kappa
To Initiate Fall

Tappees Feb. 6

Thirteen students of the
College will be initiated into
Phi Beta Kappa on Thursday,
Feb. 6, at 8 pm. in the Stu-
dent Union. ' " ‘

Tapped to the national
honorary scholastic society were
Sandra R. Blockstein, William F.
Brodt, Jr., Paul A. Chervenick,
Grace H. Crane, Robert H. Gunst,
Charles Harvath, Fred P. Heid-
enreich, Paul E. Long, Elena M.
Mesiana, David L. Ravell-a, Paul

A. Schwartz, Michael Taleff, and.

Paul G. Zolbrod.

Speaker at the initiation will
be Vice Chancellor Elvis Stahr.
His subject is “The Challenge to
American Higher Education.”

Mr. Stahr was a member of Phi
Beta Kappa at the University of
Kentucky. '

Phi Beta Kappa taps its mem-
bers twice a year, in the fall and
spring. The above are fall tapees.

June graduates of ‘the College
will be tapped this spring during
Honors Day ceremonies.

tion to the students.

This semester, seven courses
in ﬁve departments will use the
new schedule. They. are: all
sections of“Accounting 1 and 3,
Biology 1, 5, and 11, Economics
2 and Physics 3.

Thursday, Jan. 23, usually the
ﬁrst day of regular exams, has
been set up as the special day for
the departmental exams. Actually,
exams for students not taking the
above courses ‘will start on Fri-
day, January 24.

The purpose of the new exam-
ination schedule is to eliminate
the necessity of giving ﬁve or six
different examinations to students
taking the same course. =-It will
also give the faculty a chance to
see the performance of all the
students on one standard, depart-
mental test.

Mr. Batchelder added that by
next semester, the new exam
program will be expanded to
other departments. The one big
problem they are faced with is
conflicting exam schedules.

However, Batchelder said they
are working very hard on the new
program and by next year several
departments will be added to the
ﬁve which initiated the program.

In the regular schedule page 3,
places for ‘biology, economics and

physics examinations have not
been included.
Instructors in the v a-r i o u s

courses will be given a schedule

Ballet Fantasy
In Second Film

Student Congress today
presents “The Red Shoes,”
the second ﬁlm in its current
series. It begins at 3 p.m. in
the ‘ballroom of the Student
Union. ‘

“The, Red Shoes” is a techni-
color production starring Moira
Shearer, Anton Walbrook and Ma-
rius Goring. Based on a famous
tale of Hans Christian Anderson,
it has won three academy awards.

This movie i. a serious music-
al. It is a fantasy built around
human emotions.

The story concerns an enchant-
ed pair of shoes owned which fall
into the possession of a beautiful
girl. She ﬁnds that as long as she
wears them she cannotkeep from
dancing. ,

The musical arrangements and
ballet scenes which follow her
episodes have resulted in critics

Small Meetings Held

Smaller meetings have already

been held between members of
the calendar committee and stu-
dent leaders.
~ Proposals for the trimester
year were announced shortly
before Christmas vacation 'by
Chancellor Litchfield and the
committee.

The suggested calendar
term 1958-1959 is:
mester: Sept. 8-Dec. 23; winter
trimester, Jan. 5-Apr. 18; and
spring trimester, Apr. 27—Aug. 8.

According to the plan students
would be admitted at the begin-
ning of any trimester, and parti-
cipation throughout any year
would be voluntary.

The poll conducted by THE
PITT NEWS immediately be-
fore the conditions of the pro-
gram were announced showed
that two-thirds of the students
were opposed to the plan.

Reactions of the students rang-
ed from questioning the ability of
the University to acquire enough
faculty members to teach the add-
ed number of courses to how the
new schedule would accommodate
student teaching. .

In order to see if adverse op-
inion has changed since the tri-
mester program has been ex-
plained more clearly. The Pitt
News will conduct. another poll.

ball team, visitsthe Field House tonight in quest of their

thirteenth consecutive Win. A
superb Mountaineers attempt

sell-out [crowd will watch the
to cement their claim to the

Number One ranking in national polls.
Led by sharp-hooking Lloyd Sharrar, the 6-10 center

and team captain, and sophomore%

scoring leader Jerry West, the
Hillbillies expect to stage their
annual rout of the Panthers.

Last year, paced by Rod Hund-
ley, West Virginia just edged the
Blue and Gold, 89-86, at the Field
House. They later added a 107-93
victory in Morgantown. Hundley
is gone from the Hillbilly ranks,
but the Visitors seemﬂto be better
without their super-star. ’

The W.V.U. /basketeers are the
best-balanced quintet in‘ the
country/Beside Sharrar and West,
Coach Fred Schaus’s team boasts
Don Vincent, an uncanny play-
maker, Bob Smith, a clutch shoot-
er, and Joedy Gardner, the best
all-round player on the squad.

In addition, Willie Akers and
Bob Clousson have ben called the
“finest pair of substitutes in the

country,” by Coach Adolph Rupp,
I of Kentucky. Apparently, the V15‘

iting Ridgerunners can do no
wrong. 0

They have already beaten Ken-
tucky, and defending national
champion, North Carolina. The
only thing which may prevent
their going undefeated after to-
nightis the pressure of an un-
beaten record.
. The local Panthers are cooking
up a surprise for the Moun-
taineers, or so they hope. In beat-
ing Syracuse, 71-68, last Satur-
day night, in New York, the locals
displayed ﬁne second-half form.
The good play netted 51 points in

One of the few times the
home fans will be able towsee
the Wrestlers in action will
be Saturday night when they
face the Syracuse Orange at.
the Field House at 9 p.m.

The Orange will bring a 1-2 re-
cord with them. They have clown-
ed Ithaca College, 15-8, after los-
ing their ﬁrst two to Lehigh and
Cornell. ‘

Joe Scanura’s line-up will

have one man who is still unde-

feated in dual meet competition
with a 3-0 slate in the form of

Bill Austin (137). Three other

Orangemen have twinning rec-

ords. Ed Carlin (123), Bill

Waples (147) and Bill Murphy

(167) have records of 2-1. I

Gordan Carberry (157) and Bill
White (177) have 1-1 records
while George Creason (130)
Marty Lavanhar (157) and Al
Benecick (heavyweight) have yet
to score a win.

The always cautious Coach Rex
Peery comments “I hope our boys
don’t take Syracuse too lightly
just because of their poor record.
They are always improving. Be-
side their ﬁrst two losses came
at the hands of Lehigh and Cor-
nell, always tough opponents.”

Dave Johnson (167) will be

going after his third victory and
third straight pin. Paul Powell

(123), Vic DeFelice (137), and

Tom Alberts (177) will be seek-
ing their third straight victory.
Chuck_Moyer (130), Bob Sent-
ner (147), and Bob Richardson
(157) will be looking for vic-
tory number two while Alex
Skirpan tries for his ﬁrst.

Last Saturday night the Pan-
thers handed the Maryland Terps
their ﬁrst loss 21-8 at College
Park. - ‘

  

thelast twenty minutes.

Coach Bobby Timmons appears
to have come up with an effective
starting line-up, at last. The com-
bination of Jules Pegues, Don
Hennon, Chuck Hursh, Dave Saw-
yer, and John. Mesher seems to
have jelled. The addition of
Mesher to the ﬁvesome is the rea-
son for the success.

If the Blue and Gold hope for
the upset of the year tonight, it
will take a 100% performance by
Don Hennon to turn the trick.
Pegues has been sensational of
late, but the lanky senior cannot
carry the complete scoring load.

Gymnasts Go For Second Win;
Meyer Leads Syracuse Squad

Syracuse will be the Panthers opponent at the Field
House on Saturday night at 7:30. Last year the Orangemen
just nipped the Jungle Cats at Syracuse, while two of the
three judges thought that the Panthers had won the meet.
However, the third judge swung the decision in the favor of

Syracuse.

The Orange’s leading threat

 will be Jim Meyer. He will com-

pete in tumbling and the parallel
bars. Other threats will be Bill
Dodge on parallel bars and Larry
Hall in the rope climb.

Co-captain Jim Mulvihill scor-

ed 16 points in leading the Panther

‘ gymnasts to a 71-25 triumph over

Lock Haven in their first dual
meet of the season at the Field
House. The Jungle Cats captured
ﬁrst place in each of the six
events.

The Blue and Gold swept the
high bar, rope ‘climb, parallel
bars, and the flying rings. Co-
captains Tom Darling, who is the
defending NCAA champion, took

‘the flying rings by totaling 260

points. John Hammond captured
second and Tom Treese was third.

Sophomore Don Kasner won the
parallel bars with a 231 point
total. Mulvihill was second and
Hammond ﬁnished third. John Ca-
colice, Joe Battaglia, and John
Felman ﬁnished ﬁrst, second and
third in the rope climb.
