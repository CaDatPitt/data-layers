g The Graduate Council of the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences-met
last week in a general meeting

that only the Ph.D. signifies true

Mr. Seeman agreed that many

that many grad students would be

development of teaching abilities
as part of present Ph.D. pro-
grams.

After .some further discussion,
Dr. Chesler motioned that the

Council should act on the Pro-
vost’s proposal before considering
any alternatives to the Certificate.
‘ The motion was unanimously pass-
ed by the Council.

In other business. Dean McCoy
informed the Council that judging
by paid invoices. there are in-
creases in graduate enrollment in
almost every department this fall.
However. accurate statistics for
enrollments in each department
are still forthcoming.

Dean McCoy also reported the
number of graduate degrees
awarded by the FAS in August.
The FAS presented 65 Master of
Arts. 30 Master of Science. and
52 Doctorate of Philosophy de-
grees.

The Dean. in considering the
general functions of the Council.
urged that the Council's actions
"should be simply recommenda-
tions to the graduate faculty." He
added that he did "not feel com-
fortable legislating changes in de-
gree requirements." though such
powers do r-est under the Councils
jurisdiction.

DR. JEROME l.. ROSENBERG, currently chairman of the Department of Bio-
physics and ‘Microbiology at the University of Pittsburgh, has been
named the new acting dean of the University's Faculty of Arts and’Sci-
ences. His appointment is effective immediately.

He succeeds Associate Provost J. Steele Gow, Jr., who asked to be re-
lieved of the acting deanship to return to his work in instructional experi-
mentation at Pitt. '

Announcement of Dr. Rosenberg’s,appointment came from Dr. Wesley
W. Posvar, chancellor. Dr. Posvar_said that a selection committee, which

was appointed in June, will continue to look for a permanent appointee.

, Dr. Rosenberg was recently elected president of the University Senate,
a post he will resign. - '

He was appointed chairman of the Department of Biophysics and Mi-
crobiology in the University's’ Faculty of Arts and Sciences, this summer. A
member of the Pitt faculty since 1953, he__specializes in the chemistry of

The possible abolition of the
grading system at the University
was the subject of a WPDU debate
in the SU Ballroom at 3 p.m. last
Monday. Speakingagainst grades
was Dr. Jim Holland of the Psy-
chology Department; Dr. -Sam
Hayes of the History Department
defended the system.

Holland. also affiliated with the
University‘s Learning ‘Research
Development Center. began by
stating that the purposes of a
grading system are twofold: first.
to motivate a student; and second.
to evaluate his learning and to

predict his possibility of future, s:-:51:

SUCCESS.

Psychologists agree. according
to Holland. that grades do moti-
vate students to study. but other
shortcomings suggest their abol-
ishment. Namely. grades are too
often used as a "club for instruc-
tors." By his very function asa
grade-giver. the instructor. dom-
inates exactly what is to be learn-
ed and thereby limits the scope of
learning.

Also, grading is relative: an A‘
for one person usually means a
lower grade for another.

When grades are dispensed
with. according to Holland. the
professor will have to help stu-
dents learn instead of forcing them
to learn..Students could become
colleagues and can help each

other. whereas-under the present
' system they may be afraid to do

so since helping another student
would mess up thecurve.

As for. the necessity of grades
for the purpose of evaluation. Hol-
land said that there is little evi-
dence that the maintenance of a
good grade record is at all neces-

_sary for future jobs.

Citing further points, Holland

‘mentioned that “as a testor, the

teacher is an obstacle to get around
instead of a guider and advisor.
Weakness cannot be. evaluated
by testing, but can ‘be by an ad-
visor.” ' — A ‘
Calling the contemporary pro-
fessor a "guardian of corporate
interest." Holland said that
grades tend to eliminate creativ-
ity and that the grading system is
mostly compatible “with the uni-

. versity that produces trainees for

industry. ’ ‘-

Dr. Hayes. presenting the sec-
ond viewpoint. said that he would
not defend the grading system_as~
such. but woulddefend the neces-

sity ‘of evaluation. The fundamen- "
’ tal issue. according to Hayes. is

finding sources of criteria for
evaluation of students.

Hayes Defends Grades

DR. JAMES HOLLAND

Grades and other systems in ex-
istence ‘today use external criteria
e comparison withsomething.
else. Athletes, for example, are
compared with other athletes;
typing speed is compared with

' someone else’s typing spped. This

external criteria must‘be applied,

either intentionally or not, and .

must be applied by someone other i

than the person being evaluated.’

Two alternatives to the grading
system are the liberation model
and the interaction model. The lib-
eration model features no grades
at all, since the theory behind it
is that man’s good impulses (such
as learning) are thwarted by ex-
ternal limitations (such as
grades). The interaction model is
similar to thatbeing used today,

and goes on the premise that some 
limitationsamay be good and that 

internal impulses may be both cre-
ative or destructive. _

"The problem is one of internal
growth and development.” If all
grades were abolished,_ according
to Hayes. internal defects may be
made worse. Also, overcoming of
some obstacles are a desirable

. part of the educational process.

- Following questions and com-
ments by the audience. Hayes and

‘Holland summed up their argu-
‘ments. Hayes stated that a meas— ‘

urement of competence through a
grading system is "sheer _non-

. sense.“ and Holland stated that

much greater diversity would be 

obtained by abolishing grades.

To Protect Rights

Towers

The lobby area of the‘ Tower
residence halls hasibecome one
of the centers’ of student life.
The presence of the snack bar and
the entrance to the cafeteria make
inevitable and desir-
able. "In addition to the public
use, the lobby area is also the only
large gathering place for the resi-
dents who live in the lobby

_ area is also the only large gather-

ing place for the residents who
live in the towers. It is also their
living room. In order_to assure
that best use of the space in serving
this dual purpose. the-Residence
-Hall and Advisory Board (RHAB)

; has proposed some general poli-

cies. RHAB is "composed of 3 re-
presentatives each from Men’s
Dormitory Council, _Women’s'
Housing Board, along with the
University Housing Staff.) These
policies are the result ..of much»
thought on ‘the part of the cur-

V . rent board and the experience of.

the students in résidencefor sev-
eral-years. They are iﬁtended,_not
to limit the use of the area by
non-residence students, but wel-
come all students. .Nor are they in-‘
tended to restrict freedom. of
speech or circulation of any kind
of printed material originating

’. ' among students. They are intend-I

ed rather to. protect the rights of
including the
1600 residents in the Towers, to
assure orderly procedure and to

exclude unauthorized ‘outsiders

from .the use ', of University
property as a_gathering place or for

propaganda purposes. The policies
, governing these areas are:

1. Students will_not be allowed
to distribute literature-personally

1 in the lobby at anytime. There, '

-will be an area.-‘inthe l_ob_by‘of

the Towers for the dissemination  l
and display of 'campu.;s__.literature '

of both recognized‘ and ’unr’e.cog- '

nized University ‘_organizations.* ‘
V This area will consist of a table
or tables on which;this literature . i

i

may be placed to be picked up

at the discretion of students. In

order to provide for effective and
display of literature, those ‘or-

. ganizations desiring to may set_ up
‘a display or poster which is to be

placed on or at the side of the
display‘ table. In’ fairness to all

maximum period" of three (3) con-
secutive days in any week. The
maximum hours for the use of the

’ booth‘ will be from 9 a.m. to.9 p.m.

The lack of space necessitates
that the operation of booths be
limited to three (3) recognized
organizations and to no more than
three (3) booths at a; given time.
A booth is regarded as a table
that is arrayed with signs of that
particular organization’ reserving
it and manned by its representa-

4. Literature is not to be dis-
tributed personally within the
living area of any residence hall
(i.e. above the main lobby floor).

5. All organizations. Univer-
sity recognized or not recognized,
due to the lack of space must have
their signs, posters. or banners
stamped through regular Univer-
sity channels before placing them
in the towers. All stamped pos-
ters and signs must be picked up
in the Housing Office within 24
hours after they. are left. It is
the student's responsibility

"to post such articles.

6. Posters, banners, and signs are,
not permitted on telephone booths,

7i Except for World War II, the war in Vietnam has been

,-the most expensive war in American history. It has been a
_'war that will have cost $110 billion by the end of the next

fiscal year. It has, been a war that has become our third

‘most costly war in the number of men killed and wounded
‘in’ action. We, the staff members of The Pitt News, feel

that the expense is not justified in the name of U.S. imper-

Chancellor

Speaks Out:
End The War

‘(Editor's Note: The following
statement appeared in the Pitt
News, October 17. Chancellor
Wesley W. Posvar signed this state-
ment, which stands as his point of
view about the war in Vietnam,
with 79 other Chancellors and Pres-
idents of colleges and universities
on October 8.)

We speak as individuals who
work with young men and women.
The universities and colleges
which we serve take no positions
as institutions on the Vietnam
war: these are pluralistic com-
munities where men speak for
themselves alone on off-campus
issues.

There are times to be silent and
times to speak. The accumulated
costs of the Vietnam war make this
a time to speak out against it in
clearest terms. The costs are not
in men and material alone. There
are costs too in the effects on
young people’s hopes and beliefs.

The vast majority of the students .

with whom we work still want to
believe in a just, honest and sensi-
tive America. But they see our
military role in Vietnam as a de-
nial of so much that is best in our
society. _
More and more. we see the war
deflecting energies and resources
from urgent business on our own

doorsteps. An end to the war will ,

not solve the problems on or off
the campus. It will. however. per-
mit us to work more effectively
in support of more peaceful prior-

ities. Far from being more effec- _

tively in support of more peaceful
priorities. Far from- being de-
pressed about our nation's future
‘and our institutions" future. we see
bold opportunities ahead once the
divisiveness of this war is in’ the
past. ‘

We urge upon the President of
the {United States and upon Con-
gress a stepped-up timetable for
withdrawal from Vietnam. We be-
lieve this to be in our country's
highest interest. ‘ at home and
abroad.

I agree to be listed as an indi-
vidual signer of this statement.

  Anti-War Policy  

(The following resolution was
introduced at the FAS meeting,
Octoberl4.)

It is very important that the
reason for this moderate wording
be made clear. The reason is
not for any doubt as to the can-
cerous nature of our engagement
in Vietnam, nor any reluctance to
advocate immediate and total
withdrawal of American forces
from that conflict. Those of us
who support this’ resolution find
no justification for the barbarity
taking place in South Vietnam,
either that of our enemy or that
of our agents. The case against
our participation in the war can
reasonably be stated in the most
draconian terms.

WE CANNOT preserve ‘ for
Thieu and Ky their present he-
gemony except at the cost of main-
taining a police state.

WE CANNOT contain Peking’s
influence, even were she blant-
antly expansionist, by propping up
puppets in Saigon and opposing
the dominant, if Communist, na-
tionalistic force in Vietnam.

WE, CANNOT hand Saigon
-either democracyor independence
on a silver platter, or, as a foreign
enforcer, create se1f-determina-
tion for the Vietnamese.

WE CANNOT uphold Eisen-
hower’s commitment to Dienm
when Diem himself did not at-
tempt to fulfill the preconditions
of that modest commitment.

WE CANNOT defend Honolulu
by‘ creating a carriage in Indo-
china.

WE CANNOT advance the gen-

‘ eral cause of freedom by an-in-

tervention which is perceived by
all the world as one more im-
perialistic adventure.

WE CANNOT despite the spec-
ious plausibility of the domino

theory, sustain the minor league .

defoliating a jungle of napalm-
ing its inhabitants.

On condemnation of the war,
then, we do not give an inch. It
must be condemned summarily.

Why, then do we not go beyond
the action of the University
Senate on October 2 and seek to
shut down the FAS? Primarily _be-
cause we are sensitive to the fact,
however much we may deprecate
it, that some of our colleagues and
some of our students put a high-
er priority on holding classes to-
morrow than on condemning the‘
war in Vietnam. There has been

' talk about the tyranny of the

majority, which some claim would
be exercised were they forbidden
to hold or attend class. I personal-
ly do not find this fear compel-
ling. Were there a natural castas-
trophe this University would (be
shut down fast enough. As a pro-
test against the moral catastrophe
of Vietnam, cancelling a days
classes is hardly tyrannical. But
this is a matter on which reason-
able men could disagree. All we
do.is strongly urge you to respect
our moratorium.

There remains the bulwark of
opposition to the first paragraph’
of this resolution, the belief that
_Universities ought not ‘to take
political . positions.

But even this reason for muting
or postponing action does not com-
mand the highest salience. Are
we really to believe that a mod-
ern, Federally-financed multi-
versity is neutral in the political
arena? Is there one school among
us which is without complicity
in the designs of the military-in-
dustrial establishment? Who can
really say, with a straight face,
thatthis University, as a Univer-
sity, has not supported the war,

V has taken no position on it?

From where I stand-, the claim
to academic non-partisanship is a

myth. By declaring ourselves, now ‘

as a faculty, opposed to the war,
we are purchasing absolution lb?
one small fraction of the enor-
mous talent and resources which

we have already poured into,

that war. Lipset is worried that
this kind of action will open the
‘floodgates to condemning all the
horrors of the world. Splendid. If
they are horrors on which ‘we as
reasonable men agree, then they
should be condemned, as we have
already condemned American ra-
cism.

Some of you are disturbed by
the fear that observing this present
moratorium will encourage a
campaign for a two-day morator-
ium in November, and longer
ones later. I want to obviate this
fear in one sense. There is a
point» of diminishing returns for
actions of this sort; it is far‘ from
clear that a two-day moratorium
would be productive in November;
and I want the record to show that
the mover does not intend this re-
solution to commit us to a similar
or more extensive cancellation lai-
ter. If the war machine grinds on,
we shall have to take additional
steps, but who can say at this
time ,what they will be. ‘Suf-
ficient unto the day are the evils
thereof.

But I do want this Faculty, ‘to-
day.,t'/o declare itself as a faculty
firmly against the war firmly in
favor of taking a defeat on a foreign
soil which we should never have
invaded. and defeat on an_ issue.
which has led us into a moral tur-

er recover. .   D; _»

I’m going to set down a couple of feelings I have about college.
about this University. I'm writing them in the hope that someone will
read them and say “Hey. I feel that way.“ or "This guys full of

bullshit."

To begin with. I wake up most mornings in my fraternity house
room and go to a class or two. I see some friends afterwards. eat
lunch. maybe go to another class. see some more friends. eat dinner.
go study at the library or get work done that’s due in a class the fol-
lowing day. come back to the fraternity house. bullshit. listen to rec-

ords and then go to sleep.

Some days I read the New York Times or Newsweek for I must

\;1"

keep up with the important events going on around me. Other days I
read the Pitt News and try to get a hint of what’s going on at the

University. All days. I end the same way in bend with my head lay-

ing on myfolded arms, thinking.

I think, "what have I learned in this University?, Now that I am
in college, I should be learning. What in hell do did I learn today
about living, life or me.” The answer never comes.

So I say to myself. “what are you going to do about the fact that
today and every other day, you learn nothing?” I could do nothing,
but this seems quite illogical because I feel that I must do some-

thing.

I could try to initiate some sort of changegbut whenever I do I
always run into the problem of feeling left out from’ the group that
is leading. I feel alienated from the group of “concerned students”
who have meetings 11 o’clock at night in some little office of the

Student Union. --

They sit and make judgements about the "students” as if, be-
cause of their own‘ knowledge and wisdom, they aren’t in the same
» boat. Often’ their trouble, and they know it, is that they are as con-

fused as I.

What do I want? I want the outlet that I had last March at the

Open University and looked forward to this September. An open for-
um for me to air my views and for more knowledgable people to re-

act and act upon them.

It never came about so’ I lay here in bed, thinking, confused and
frustrated. Maybe we can all get off our asses and just communicate.

-I feel that is accomplishment enough.

How Our Readers See It

 Thesis Called  

Toppycoek’

To the Editor of the Pitt News
Dear Sir: . '

I wish to comment on Profes-
sor Bramhall’s assorted pieties
which appeared on the front page
of the Pitt News. He begins ro-
bustly —— “It is arrogant,\absurd,
and hypocritical (wouldn’t “in-
correct” have been a sufficiently
damaging characterization) to
pretend that education is. or can
be. the injection, into students,
of a predefined, universally "ap-
propriate body of facts, skills and
analytical techniques.”

-If we preservere through the lo-
gical thicket we find that he
means more —— that he is concern-
ed not only with the techniques
of educations but with its sub-
stance. “Education means the de-
velopment in individuals of effec-
tive ways of understanding them-
selves and the world (is this a sub-

-tle endorsement of the language
requirement?) and of ways to
act in the world as it undergoes
rapid change." Having made this
assertion, he sweeps in forthe kill
("Holy. look around at the world
and judge what education has

.done to people and their ability
to manage their physical and so-
cial environment" ).

Now one is supposed to believe
that Vietnam. racism. and air

. pollution are the consequences of
our educational system. This is
the sheerest poppycock. It is tan-
tamount to saying look — here
we have this system and here we
have these problems — egro the
system caused the problems.“ If
this is the level of logic we can

- expect from a Professor of Eco-
nomics then the University «in-

. deed needsrestructuring. ’

seriously. Stripped of its_prom-
posity ‘it reduces to the fact that
the promary mission of the Uni-
versity is to preach to its stu-
dents a way of life. It essentially
mistrusts the student to estab-
lish the relevancy link between the
facts and_ analytical techniques
‘which he would learn from a clas-
sical education and his own ex-
istence.

The ‘serious problems of the
thesis are two fold. First there is
the time problem. The time re-
quired» to learn the facts and te-
chniques in an intricate subject

_(like chemistry) is so enormous '

that there is essentially none left
for this type relevancy study
(presumably like analyzing the
harmful effects of napalm). If
one tries to beat the problem by
cutting out substantial amounts

,of hard nosed. nitty gritty ma.-

terial./then you foster ignorance
of the very subject to which you're
trying to develop relevance. In
short you can‘t meaningfully use
chemistry to learn how toiact in
“a changing world“ if ‘you don't
know any chemistry.

But more serious‘ than the logis-
tics problem is the basic policy.

The University should not assume '

for itself the omniscience to di-

rectly attempt to mold the per-.

sonality of its students. Surely’,
the student will be exposed. dur-'
ing his stay here. to a cross cur-
rent of disciplines and ways of
life. It is for the student to
pick and choose a philosophy and
a perspective of life among these
and other experiences. One
would hope that the student would

choose wisely. He must however

be free to decide for himself. In
so doing ,,he may make decisions
which Bramhall or I wouldn't
like. He might even favor a mili-
tary victory in Vietnam. We. as
faculty. shouldtnot use the privi-

rposition. to "straight—g 

You could love Delaney....

No one wrote a song about 

by GEORGE LIES
Contributing Editor

It was windy. and I was com-
ing home in my car. and all of
a sudden KQV blasts out its re-
morseful chiller that Paul Mc-
Cartney might be dead. A chill
drained my body, and I don't
know why.

A moment later. I heard De-
laney was shot:

“Serious condition . ser-
ious condition . . . serious con-
d . . L”

The words swelled in my eyes,
and almost ran down my cheeks.
who was the ass that shot him?
He was only doing his job . . .

Delaney is a cop to be exact.
but he's the best cop I’ve ever
met, and that includes the one
who used to come and keep my
parents from fighting on Christ-
mas Eve.

Delaney/, Richard of some num-
bered house on 38th Street in‘
Lawrenceville, and he never hurt
a soul. And, that includes his own
son who he’s probably had to keep
in line a number of times.

Delaney is a‘ man, and if he
would die . . . it would be wrong,
a loss of a man.

Delaney is an Irishman. and when

he was young . . . well. Iwouldn’t
have been the one to argue with
him. No sir. Delaney wasn’t
poor, he wasn’t rich: He lived

to his time and inclinations to
determine the extent and nature of
his involvement in societies prob-
lems. To convert our lectures
into massive social factories is to
deprive the student of the tech-
nical basis for arriving at his
own decisions and to victimize
him with out opinions.

The last part of Bramhall’s let-
ter is essentially a plea _for a
more customized education.‘ The
principle is unassailable (allow-
ing for Brahmallian excesses
like all requirements only com-
ing from within). Who is the scoun-
drel who favors impersonal instruc-
tion? However as an Economist
and Social Scientist Bramhall

ought to address himself to sever- .

al cogent problems. For instance.
how does one reconcile and modu-
late the two desirable objectives
of mass education and custom-
ized education? If he opts for
smaller entering classes, what
should be the basis of the selec-
tion system (surely not grades! )?
Does the University have any re-
sponsibility in testifying about
the performance of its students?
If so. how shall it meet that re-
sponsibility‘? ‘If not. how shall we
redefine the meaning of a B.A.
or B.S. degree? Should, degrees
be granted purely on the basis

~ of attendance? Should attendance

be taken in every class? Should
degrees be granted at all?

To raise practical questions of
this nature is not to deny the ur-
gency of constantly _reappraising
ourselves and our University. It
is to say that such a reappraisal
is not facilitated by this sort of
curious concoction of santimon-
ions dribble. If the University

has any definable objective it is

\



surely to train the student to be’

impatient with the ‘undisciplined’
mumbo. jumbo .i_n Bramhall’s col-’


..

, We. accomplish -awareness by

Wednesday, October 29,

for his family, and to help them
he even moonlighted part—time as
a bus driver. probably for some
church or for some school dis-
trict. He was always in charge.

“Booze costs a lot these days,”
he said when you noticed he was

working two jobs. But he was ly- ~

ing, you knew that. He was work-
ing for his family.‘ the one he
loved.

Delaney has crew-cut. blond
hair. blue eyes; and he doesn't
break the rules. Yeah, he’d let
me in the Union sometimes if I
didn’t have my pass but that’s be-
cause he knew I wouldn't shoot
him in the gut. And I knew that.

I respected Delaney: He was
a man first, a cop second. and a
friend third. He didn’t like cream
in his coffee, at least White Tow-
er coffee where late deadlines
made me an addict.

You could love Delaney, he
was for real.‘ And no one wrote a
song about him like they did
about Harrigan, and that's too bad
because he could be anyone he
wanted to be. But he was hum-
ble.

No one faked him out, and no

. one could cop a plea with him. He

knew every angle.

Why was he shot‘? That's not
the question. the question is
who does the person shoot? De-
laney wasn’t afraid of anything.
He had guts, more than balls.

Greeks

Pledge

Recent publicity throughout the
country has strongly indicated
that the Greek system is dying.
The sisters of Phi Sigma Sigma
are seeking an answer to the grow-
ing problem of what is rele-
vant. and we believe that we
have. at least partially, solved it.
The group structure which exists
in the Greek System is only good
to the point at which it does not
stifle individual freedom.

Fear of breaking away from
“the group” to express one’s true
feeling has prevented many Greeks
from taking an active part in
things other than mixers and other
social events (-with a yearly phil-
anthropy project that means very
little to the individual), We are
not denying the importance of fun,
but we are suggesting that
Greeks. could be getting more
from the University and the Uni-
versity should be getting more
from the Greeks. Phi Sig has de-
cided against participation in
things that the sisters do not be-
lieve in — things that we have
done in the past just for the sake
of "saving face” or “looking good
for rush.”

We now participate only in
what we believe- in. As a‘ group,
we can accomplish things much
more effectively than can an
individual. For example, we are
working for the ASRC by “word
of mouth” canvassing. Although
some girls within the soror-
ity believe in the value-of grades
and some do not;-we ALL believe
in the importance of the student’s
awareness of the ASRC’s issue.

Debaters Topple WVU

by HARRIS MILLER
Staff Writer

All was not gloom and despair
in Morgantown last weekend as
the William Pitt Debating Union
defeated West Virginia University
in the Second Annual Pitt-West
Virginia Debate. Victor Willem
and Harris Miller from the WPDU
defeated the team of Jerry Fogg
and Rick Robinson on the topic.
Resolved: Breakfast cereal is
part of the international commun-
istconspiracy. .

The debate which took place
Friday afternoon as a kickoff to

WVU‘s‘Homecoming event was
very well attended. The style of
the debate was audience partici-
pation which placed emphasis on
entertaining the audience, an em-
phasis which Willem and Miller
fulfilled well. n

The decision on the debate was
announced during halftime activ-
ities of the football game. By vir-
tue of their victory, the WPDU re-
tained the Charles E. Hodges Me-
morial Trophy. which -will hang
proudly in the WPDU office until
next year. when the team will seek
its third straight victory.

CPS RELEASE
From the people who brought

-‘you nerve gas, the moon flight and
' ABM, we now have Operation In-

tercept.

Operation Intercept is the Nix-
on. Administration’s James Bon-
dian title for an all-out air, land
and sea assault it is mounting to
reduce the traffic of marijuana
and other drugs between Mexico
and the U.S.

The operati'on’s arsenal in-
cludes German Shepherd dogs
trained to react to the scent of

-marijuana, Navy patrol boats in

the Gulf of Mexico, Air Force pur-
suit planes, a web of radar screens

installed by the Federal Aviation.

Administration to detect illegal
border crossings, and aircraft
equipped with electronic sensing
devices capable of sniffing poppy
fields from the sky.

The cause for this increased
surveillance — comprising the

most intensive drug crackdown in
U.S. history—is a 55-page report
released by the Special Presiden-
tial Task Force Relating to Nar-
cotics, Marijuana and Dangerous
Drugs.

The report, authored by 22 gov-
ernment personnel under the di-
rection of Deputy Attorney Gener-
al Richard Kleindienst. makes the
following conclusions about mari-
juana:

ll It is psychologically addict-
ing, tending to lead to the use of
hard narcotics, because once the
user has adopted the drug as a
"crutch to cope with life stress."
he is "substantially more suscep-
tible to the acquisition of a larger
crutch through the medium of a
stronger drug.”

2) Its widespread use by the
young constitutes a “significant

this critical period of development
is likely to affect adversely the
ability of the individual to cope
with the demands of a complex so-
ciety.

3) Though medical evidence
"neither proves nor disproves
that marijuana is a cause of
crime, "criminal records estab-
lish clearly "an accelerating rate
of association between crime and
the use of marijuana.”

The report says current evi-
dence suggests that over five mil-
lion people in the U.S. have tried
grass at least once. and perhaps
60 per cent of the students at some
colleges and universities.

Since “more than 80 per cent of
the marijuana smoked in the Unit..-
ed States, about 20 per cent of
the heroin used. and an undeter-
mined volume of illegal ampheta-
mines" enter the nation illicitly
from Mexico, the report advocat-
ed a commission of resources to-
ward restricting the drug flow
from that Central American coun-
try as the panacea.

Mitchell's assistant Kleindienst,
briefing the Washington press in
advance, had remarked that the
crackdown would remain in effect

until marijuana becomes so
scarce that the price lid is driven
beyond what most, especially teen-
agers, are able to afford.

When that happens. he said.
young people won't turn to the
more available harder drugs be-
cause. marijuana being non-addic-
tive. desperation won‘t ensue
when they can't get any. Rather
than switch to psilocybin. mesca—
line or LSD. they will abandon the
drug habit.

Operation Intercept parallels a
similar attack on marijuana being
waged in Vietnam. where tens of
thousands of US. servicemen are
understood to have turned on. The
U.S. Army has been fighting a war
of_ suppression involving federal
agens, police dogs, helicopters
and television announcements.

Military spokesmen say many
soldiers have been reprimanded,
some docked in pay and reduced

‘in _rank, and a few dishonorably

discharged in connection with the
use or sale of pot. Over three tons
‘of grass have been confiscated and
destroyed, they say.

The anti-drug drives appear to

, represent but another manifesta-

tion of the hard line Nixon has

  Nixon Cracksdown Hard On Drug Traffic

taken on what he refers to as the
"drug abuse problem.”.

The administration’s drug bill,
proposed by the late Sen. Everett
Dirksen and currently before the
Senate Subcommittee to Investi-
gate Juvenile Delinquency, lumps
marijuana. heroin and LSD to-
gether, keeping the same penalty
structure for a’ first offense of pos-
sessing any of the three: a mini-
mum of two and maximum of 10
years in prison.

Anyone convicted of a first of-

tense in selling the drugs will face ‘

5-20 years in prison and a $25.-
O00 fine under Nixon‘s bill. Any-
one convicted of a second selling
offense will face 10-40 years in-
carceration and a $50,000 fine.
There would be no opportunity for

probation or suspension of the-

sentences.

Contradicting the Task Force
report, Dr. Stanley Yolles placed
the number of Americans who
have used marijuana at between
8-12 million. Disputing the phil-
osophy behind the hard line ap-
proach to drugs, he said federal
drug laws should be -aimed at re-
habilitation, not repression.

Critic   Disappointed

by THOMAS P. MILLER
Staff Writer

The Madwoman of Chaillot is
the most frustrating movie since
I Am Curious, Yellow, with one
major difference separating the
two. While the latter was a bad
movie trying desperately to look
like a good movie. The Madwom-
an of Chaillot is a bad movie that
has the look of not even trying.

I believe it could have been a
good movie. The original play by
Jean Giraudoux is a beautiful
piece about the Countess Aurelia.
the madwoman in question. who
lives her life exclusively in 1919.
while the date is unquestionably
now. This is where the first frus-
tration lies. The director attempts
to set up the dichotomy between
her world and the real one. But it
doesn't work. Hers is too closed
and personal to be defined by
showing her dressed in the elegant
flowery trappings of 1920 as she
slithers through a dense under-
growth of Fiats and Mercedes-
Benz in a Parisian traffic jam.
Why doesn’t the director let us

 By Madwoman Effort

see the woman without the gawk-

ing drivers in their bumper-to- I

bumper Peugots? We want to see
her.

In the original play the mad-
woman’s philosophy is simple.
“There is nothing so wrong with
the world that three women can’t

‘fix in one afternoon over tea.” So, ,

when she is told that there are
evil men in the world who are go-
ing to destroy Paris, it is not sur-
prising that she decides, over tea,
to rid the world of them by lock-
ing them up in the depths of the
earth, the entrance to which hap-
pens to be in her cellar. Simple
and beautiful.

But this is where the movie de-
parts from simpleness and beau-.
ty. Instead of a clear light on
Countess Aurelia. we get a muddy
view of Yul Brynner. the villain,
and his accomplices plotting to
destroy the city. Here the scenes
are hopelessly long. confused. and
unnecessary. We can accept that
there is evil in the world. and we
don‘t need 15 minutes of Yul Bryn-
ner grunting at the peasants to tell
us so. Every minute spent with
Yul is a minute less of insight we

get into the Countess‘ personal and .

romantic world.

form into another. it would make ‘

didn‘t have in the previous form.
The director of The Madwoman of
Chaillot has taken away rather
than improved or changed the
original play. In one instance. lo-
cation scenes in Paris could add to

the mood. but in this case the di- .

rector merely uses the city to let
his movie sprawl. I suppose this
is the most frustrating thing about
the film. It does such great injus-
tice to Giraudoux’ original con-
ception. the virtue of which was
simplicity.

Katherine Hepburn and the rest
of the well-known cast are lost in
the shuffle. It is disappointing to
see Miss Hepburn run through a
role without ever really telling‘ us
anything about her character. Ev-
ery time she tries, the camera
switches to the face of Richard

Chamberlain. He is supposed to I.
remind the Countess of her long "

gone lover, but the only succeeds
in reminding me of those years as
treakle-ridden Doctor Kildare.

The Madwoman of.Chaillot is so .- -
muddled and confused that it

could easily stand an entire re-
working. Dear World was a
charming musical comedy version
of the Giraudoux play that re-
ceived critical disapproval. If any
of those critics have seen The
Madwoman of Chaillot, I can bet
there are a few wistful sighs for
Dear World.

CONCLUDING “VISION”

The conclusion is that both
Kubrick and Clarke have a vis-
ion and each is supported equal-
ly well by the frame of the story.
The result is the pleasure of two
well-developed points-of-view to-
ward the same subject.

There are two specific differ-
ences between novel and film
2001 which are interesting in that

.'endeavor to examine 3 Phenomenon they indicate how episodes might

be adapted_ to the strengths of the
medium into which the adapta-
tion is made. The first concerns
the use of television-calls. Clarke
can only hint at the ineffectiven-
ess of such space-age gadgets
but Kubrick, employing his visual
medium, can demonstrate the vac-
cuum into which the birthday
call to Frank Poole comes by
registering no response in his
actor. Furthermore, he has estab-
lished with a previous call (from
Dr. Floyd to his daughter) the
effect that Poole’s parents ex-
pected.

The second difference invol-
ves the destructive impulse of
/HAL. Clarke has HAL opening’
pod-bay doors to evacuate the ship
in his attempt ‘to doin Dave
Bowman. The torrent created by
escaping air capturing equipment

that an author can do well, i.e.,
; describe panic. Kubrick’s script
calls for Dave Bowman to enter

into a chase after the free-fall-.

ing Frank Poole before engaging
in a battle ofwits with HAL who
refuses to let him back in the
ship. Kubrick’s decision reflects
anlappeal to what cinema can
do well: demonstrate determina-
tion. V

The reviewer has not dicussed
a film-novel pair in which the
film can be viewed as an ex-
tension of the novel because he
cannot think of one. Even so,
two criteria appear to have been
found: coherence of character-

ization and adaptation‘ to media '

strengths.

Drugs Dubbed Useless

by BILL GORMLEY
Staff Writer

Former junkie Robert Moor-

man opened the drug forum-

Thursday night with an informal
but lucid description of his
experiences with drugs ranging
from marijuana to heroin to L.S.
D. While emphasizing that “you
have to make up your own mind,”
Moorman nevertheless expressed
his opinion’ that “drugs, with the

possible exception of marijuana’
- and hashish, are useless to you in

expanding your mind and are po-
tential deadly poisons.”

Recalling the impressions he
had when he first got high on mari-
juana, Moorman described the ex-
perience as a “pleasurable” one.
He said he felt as if he were in-
side a string bass’ listening to ex-
tremely intriquing music. Sha-
dows became meaningful and light
patterns shifted quickly, produc-
ing a kaleidoscopic effect.

However, Moorman expressed
I:egret at the course his life took

after his first encounter with drugs. ‘

“I lived in a complete drug cul-
ture during, the next five years,”
he recollected. “I wasted
those five years completely and
deteriorated physically and
mentally. Finally, I found my
self in Florida _State,_Prison.” ‘

Discussing different types of.
drugs separately, Moorman broke
drugs down into six categories:
(1) marijuana and hashish; (2)
solids and glues; (3) opiates; (4)

,barbituates;, (5) _ amphetamines; '
, _ and-(6) psychedelics.
and material is the kind of thing" . ' '

Although Moorman argued that
the smoking of Marijuana should

be legalized becauseit is not nec-~' '

essarily habit forming and usual-
ly involves little more than a
change in perception, he cited two
reasons against doing so. ,“The
law’s ,wrong,” he ’ maintained,
“but it’s there. If you’re caught,
you have a'record which may
prevent) you from getting a job

later on. Also, the smokingof

marijuana takes you into contact
with people of all types. The drug
scene is a whole society of its
own, with social pressures, and
you can be influenced/to do things

.you don’t really want to do."

Turning to_ solids and glues,
Moorman warned that they are
“potentially deadly’ poisons.”
While Moorrnan himself never got

. hooked on this category of drugs, ’

he witnessed the effect the in-
halation of ‘ether had on Big Al,

an underworld friend of his, who ’
" “broke people’s backs, smashed

mailblxes, and fiinally .
flipped.”

Moorman, speaking‘ as a one
time dope addict, labeled the 0-i-

lmtnon 

. 12.0" 12$

q sub.
  '1-it-3_o

.   k3\\Q\dQ,€.\\     ‘far-ili'l‘i C '

ates extremely dangerous because
of their habit-forming nature. “If
you take heroin or morphine

for too long,” he cautioned, “it’s ,

really rough to stop.” With vi-
vid detail, he described the
chills, cramps, muscular aches,

profuse sweating, and vomiting.

which accompanied his depar-
ture from the addict’s world. '

Emphasizing that barbituates

can be “just as physically addic-

ting as opiates,” Moorman poked
fun ate people who take sleeping
pills without realizing that they
fall under the same heading [as
the dope addict.

“Amphetamines,” Moorman ex-
plained, “are the complete“. op-

Moorman fondly recalled an 18

.hour conversation he had with a

friend after they both took bennies.
He also conceded that amphe-

tamines, which include benze-’

drine, dexedrine, and cocaine, can
be mind expanding. However, he
warned that, in thelongrun, am-
phetamines have a debilitating ef-

-_ feet. ‘‘You don7t get enough food,

liquid, and sleep, your willpow-
er is destroyed, your7 body deter-

_ iorates, and you end up exhausted

and malnourished,” he declared.
Moorman said that he himself was
an emaciated wreck after taking

Finishing his talk with an an-
alysis of psychedelic drugs, Moor-
man a former associate of Dr.

pros and cons of LSD usage. He
pointed out that some say their

lives have changed for the bet-.

ter as a result of acid, while
other have had unqustionably dis-
astrous trips. Although Moorman
himself never had a bad trip,
be likened the taking of ‘psy-
chedeli_c'.drugs to, a game of

r Russian roulette and ‘told of a
friend who was almost totally para-
lyzed'because she ran the risk; '

Speaking of himself, Moorman re-
vealed, “After 200 trips‘, I found

myslef in a ‘manic-depressive mood

more, Moorman argued, “Tim

mind’s consciousness through LSD

is a lie. When I,left Leary, I ‘-

think he was in much worse shape
than when I met him.”'* '

‘In conclusion, Moorman summed

up the message he hoped he had
conveyed. “My intentions isn’t
to tell anybody what to do,” he
explained. “But if anybody in
this world asked my opinion about
drugs, I would have to say that,
-except for marijuana, drugs are
dangerous and bring you into a
horror—like world. Once you step

into it,” he warned, “you may never

be able to step out of it again.”

,,New Af1'icanCollection

Has Freedom Of Style

I

The Museum of Art, Carnegie
nstitute, will celebrate Founder-

ers-Patrons Day with the opening,
last Friday of The Art of Black
Africa. This exhibit of 333 pieces
of sculpture is from the collection
of Jay C. Leif, noted throughout

‘the art world for the extensive-
ness ‘and quality of his art acquis-
itions. His collection of primitive
works is outstanding and may well
be the greatest privately owned
in this country.

African art completely refutes -

the Greco-Roman tradition, the
quest for perfection that had long

‘ been the goal of the Western ar-
tist. African art was based on —
and directed to — emotional im-

'pact. Each geographic area had

V its own style, its traditions, but
the works shows a freedom of
spirit, and acceptance of life that
was unknown to the,Western ar-
tist. '

At the turn of the century when

African work was brought to Eur-
ope, it became a major influence
in the breakthrough of Western
‘art, as reflected by such artists
as Picasso, Braque, Derain, Ma-
tisse.

Mostaof the sculpture in this ex-

ed abstract pieces of the recent
past. In all instances, the works
display a great understanding of
the materials used (wood, ivory,
clay, bronze) and a great soph-
istication in the artistic approach
to them.

“The greatest cultural contri-
butionblack Africa has made to
the world,” states Director Arkus,
“is unquestionably its sculpture.
Although their sights are on con-
temporary culture of our time,
many Afro-Americans have
acknowledged this great artistic
heritage, which is centuries old.
If this exhibition serves any pur-
pose beyond that of pure aesthetic
enjoyment, it is to call attention

to this heritage, which gives the .

black artist a sense of continuity
and magnifies our awareness of
the achievements of an ethnic
group thathas for too long been
sadly misrepresented and hardly
understood.”

Theexhibit can be viewed in the
Third Floor Galleries from Oct.
24 through Jan. 18, 1970.

Panther Secondary Gets

Boost As Salter,iBarr
Recover From Injuries

by ED CONLEY
Associate Sports Editor

Monday night practices are a little lonely for the Panthers,

nowadays.

Since the action is limited, there aren’t many people inter-
ested in viewing the sessions. And the cold weather doesn’t at-

tract a crowd either.

One of the Panther units may gain a couple more bodies this

week against Syracuse. however.
as Bryant Salter and Jeff Barr
continue to recover from injuries.

The secondary men have been
plagued by injuries for the last
few weeks. Salter has seen limit-
ed action in the last two games,
while Barr missed the games
completely.

 

’ "We’re hopeful they'll both be
ready this week." coach Carl De-
P-asqua noted.

The mentor‘s been saying that
for the last two weeks. but he just
might be right this time.

The Panther secondary certain-
lyvneeds Salter and Barr. The de-

fensive backfield unit lost the
services of starter Mike Bannan
early in the season and DePas-
qua’s had problems keeping

enough men healthy to fill the post.

Bannan was playing right cor-
nerback. and when Salter isn’t
able to give 100 per cent there. Bill
Ramos has only had one big mis-
hap during his tenure. and that
was a long aerial gain on a play
that saw Ramos catching his
spikes into the turf and falling to
the ground.

Salter grabbed off an intercep-
tion against Duke in the Panthers
first win of the season. Everyone
was praising the track star for
his efforts in that game. but he
walked off the field with the leg
injury that has hampered him
ever since.

The other three-quarters of the
defensive backfield, Charlie Hall,
Dave Dibbley and George Pribish,
has remained injury-free, and

they’ve only had one big letdown.
That came in the waning moments
of the Tulane game when the
Green Wave passed through the
secondary for a last minute touch-
down to win the game.

Dibbley has the only. other in-
terception among the secondary
men. But DePasqua is not wor-
ried about the performances of
the secondary.

"Overall. I think the secondary‘s
done pretty good.” the coach said.
“They didn’t tackle well against
West Virginia, but their (WVU’s)

, runners did a great job.

“Our secondary doesn’t have
any big people. And they broke
tackles. We have to get the sure
tackle.”

The backfield didn’t have much
passing to defend against in the
Mountaineer game, since the WVU
quarterback, Mike Sherwood. only
attempted ten passes. He com-
pleted five.

"The triple option that West
Virginia uses makes it extremely
difficult to defense them," DePas-
qua said. "It forces man-to—man
coverage. That gave their runners
some room after they got through
the holes in the line."

Garnett Shines Despite Loss

by EVAN PATTAK

Tailback Dave Garnett car-
ried the ball only four times
from scrimmage in Saturday’s
49-18 loss to WVU. but the high-
stepping junior was the most pro-
ductive Panther ground gainer.
Garnett. from Buffalo. N. Y.. re-_
turned’ seven kick-offs for 220
yards. including sparkling second-
half jaunts of 69 and 73 yards.

Setting up the second Panther
touchdown of the contest with his
69 yard gem. Garnett shone as one
of the few beacons of hope in that
otherwiserecurring nightmare of

the Pitt-West Virginia series. His

total of 220 yards shattered Eric
Crabtree's mark established in
1965.

Garnett is not the first player to
use the suicide squad as a spring-
board to stardom. The special
units of most teams are compos-
ed of reserves tr_ving to crack the
starting lineup. frustrated kami-
kaze pilots. professional sadists.
and other assorted lunatics. The
dangers involved in running
these head-hunters won't frighten
Garnett.

“I really enjoy returning
kicks,” explained the slender
speedster. We’ve got some of our
best players blocking on the re-
turns, so I don’t worry too much
about being hurt. It does get a lit-
tle tough on punt returns.”

Garnett also revealed that his
two longest returns resulted from

the initiation of a new wrinkle.
“We had been returning all of our
kickoffs straight up the middle.
But when we were down so far

. . .
. ,3‘ :.._>

that late in the game. we had noth-
ing to lose by trying a return up
the sideline.”

JUNIOR TAILBACK Dave Garnett, fully recovered from a knee injury suf-
fered In the.Duke game, broke the Panther record for kick-off returns Satur-
day as he picked up 220 yards  seven returns. PN Photo by Donaldson

‘Gathering the ball in, Garnett
faked up the middle to draw the
WVU defense inside. cut sudden-
ly to the outside. and was off for
a score, save for a breakaway
shirt that didn't.

Despite his success on the sui-
cide squad, Garnett would natur-
ally relish a greater opportunity
to run from his tailback position.
In the Panther conquest of Duke,
Garnett was head for a big game
with 67 yards gained in the first
half, when a knee injury forced
him to a premature. exit. Since
then, Tony Esposito and Denny
Ferris have been running so well
that Garnett has been watching
most of the action from the bench.

Coach DePasqua might be well
advised to use more of Garnett
against Syracuse. since he has
some unpleasant recollections of
Syracuse Coach Ben Schwartz-
walder.

"I was thinking of going to Syra-
cuse and was _in Schwartzwalders
office along with five other half-
backs. Each of them said that the
coach had promised them num-
ber 44.

“When he promised me number
44,,” laughed the genial Garnett,
“I wondered whether he meant
44A, 44B, or 44C.”

Schwartzwaldens tactic con-
vinced Garnett that Pitt was his
school. and if Dave has his way.
the Syracuse mentor will rue the
day he tried to con the fleet tail-
back. ’ .

Sophomore middle lineback-
er Ralph Cindrich was named
to the All-East squad last week for
his performance against Tulane.
Cindrich made five individual tac-
kles and was credited with six as-
sists in the game.

It was the second time this sea-
son that Cindrich gained all-East
honors. Earlier this fall. he was
named to the squad for his out-
standing performance at Okla-
homa.

Other Panthers who have been '

named to the all-East selections
earlier in the season include j_un-
ior tailback Dennis Ferris and
junior defensive tackle John St_ev-
ens, while junior defensive back
Bryant Salter gained honorable
mention.

Cindrich. who calls defensive
signals for the Panthers. was tab-
bed by Sports Illustrated maga-
zine last fall as one of the top
sophomore prospects in the coun-

' try. but an injury sidelined him

for the entire season. In addition

by BILL NAAB

Yesterday at Forbes Field the soccer team squashed Kent
State, 7-2, but the usual smiles and backslapping that occur
after a victory were not to be found. Despite scoring six more
goals than were scored in the last two matches combined, sever-

parently disappointed.

Gus Theofilos who twice smack—
ed the ‘ball into oppositions nets
remarked. "I thought we were
playing a high school team today.
’ If we had kept the ball down better
we might have doubled the score."
Actually. Theofilos felt somewhat
disappointed since three times he
blew potential scoring opportun-
ities by socking the ball-above the

_ al players trampled out of the Sennott St. exit disgusted and ap-

Nevertheless. the game was far
from a disaster. Frehmen John
White and Gus Theofilos account-
ed for five of the seven scores.
White drilled in three, goals. the
most prolific output by a booter in
one contest within the las several
seasons. Linemen Bob Trexler
and Tony Nicholakopoulos also
added to the booter offensive pro-
duction.

Bemis substituted freely and at
times the lineup contained only
freshmen and sophomores. All
three goalies saw action as Kerry
Krause _ started his first game
since the second encounter of the
season. Steve Fibel, who has been

tending goal for the past several _

weeks in Krause’s absence,’ re-
lieved him in the second quarter
with the hooters ahead, 4-2. He
played most of the remaining min-
utes._

In the final period Bemis exper-
imented abitby switching a full-
back into the halfback slot (from
a 4-2-4 to a 4-3-3). The 4-3-3 nor-
mally produces a more potent of-
fense. although the middle half-
back under the system must pos-
sess extraordinary skill and speed
in order to make things go.

It doesn‘t appear as though Be-
mis feels his personnel fits the
bill in the 4-3-3. and mentioned
that he‘ll continue using four full-
backs. '

Meanwhile. ,.Bemis and his

,Phi Gamma Delta smashed Delta Phi, 20-0, eliminating
them from B League intramural football competition Monday.

Delta Phi received the opening kickoff, but lost the ball when ’

Fiji’s Jim Ayers picked off a pass from Delta’s Rege Tomsy.

Ayers advanced the ball with a
series of runs and passes and then
fired a TD pass to Bill Hull. The
conversion attempt failed.

Delta’s Glenn Cook received
the kick and galloped deep into Fi-
ji territory. Delta Phi lost ground
on two bad snaps and handed over
the pigskin on the fourth down.

Fiji quarterback _Jim Ayers hit
Bill Hull with two passes and then
sprinted into the end zonegto put
the score at 12-0. ' _ -

Harrier Hanger Climbs

Tough Comeback Trail

by JERRY MYERS

Sophomore harrier Bob
Hagner has proved that he
has the heart of a true win-
ner. Less than one year ago,
Bob was lying in an intensive
care ward at Presbyterian Hos-
pital with a brain infection. To-
day he is running sixth man for
Coach Jim Banner’s cross country

. team.

~ This year’s cross country squad
is swiftly becoming the year of
the combacks. Jerry Richey made
headlines with miraculous re-
-turn to action from a herniated
muscle operation in August. Now
'Bob has recealed how very close
he was to death last November,
and how he had to learn to walk

again before he ever consider-_
- ’ed running. '-

The cause of Hagner’s illness I

was a virus that started in his
back and then traveled up to his
brain, settling in the medulla
It started near the
. end of the 1968 season when Bob
was still running for the fresh-
man squad. The infection spread
and on the eve of the team’s trip

. to the IC4A’s-, Friday November 17.

Bob was rushed to Presby where
heremained for an entire month._

He spent the firstftwo weeks of 7

his --hospitalization, in intensive
care and‘ there. was -a time
whe the doctors »didn’t‘ believe
he would live through it. By De-
cember 17, he was ready to. be
moved and began the long road

» back to. recovery, in a rehabili-

tation center in his hometown of

Reading, Pennsylvania. There he

sophomore status. The climzx of
his comeback was his 21st place
finish out of a 175 man field.
against the best track schools in
the East, last Saturday at
Canisius..

A veteran of two state cham-
pionship races in high school,
Bob Came in 2nd in his senior
year in the state finals.~ His
high school, exeter, copped the
class B championship four of the
six years it’s been run. Bob sees a
big difference-between high school
cross country and the college
sport. He gives a lot of credit to
Coach Banner for moulding the
squad, but still thinks the team is
one of the best. “We should have
no trouble beating Penn State,”
he added.

“Mr. Banner’s great. He’s dif— _

ferent from a high school coach.
If you’re not running up to par
he worries what’s wrong and tries
to correct it. It’s the kind of
thing where you can discover what
your potential is by running un-
der a college coach,” comment-
ed Bob.

Hagner gives a lot of credit for

the success of the team‘ this‘

year to Dave Szabet. “When Dave
first came up we had all heard
that he was a good 2-miler, but
we knowhe had never run cross

country. He’s the biggest sur-

'don’t think we’ll have_ any trouble «

prise of the season.”

Bob sees a tough two weeks
ahead of the barriers as they pre-
pare for the Penn State meet on
the eighth of November. The
team ran almost nineteen miles in
practice on Monday and Coach
Banner was very ‘pleased with
their times. They now have double
work-outs planned for most of
this week and the early part of
next week.

“Penn State is [not nearly as
strong as they were last year. I

beating.them,” Following the Penn
State-meet, and hopefully an un-
defeated season Bob « is looking’
forward to‘ the IC4A’s. He re-
members only too well how close
he came to them last year.

Stirs Hope For Team.

by ED CON LEY
Associate Sports Editor

Winners are pretty hard to find around campus, but if you
lookhard enough you’ll run into some. . ‘

The newest champion, though, is about the most diffiv-ii‘
cult to find. The champ’s specialty is archery; the big win
ner" is pratically a one-man team: she’s a girl.  V

Ruth Rowe, a senior in the
College of Arts and Sciences,
captured the Eastern District
Intercollegiate Archery Tourna-
ment title last week at Glassboro '
State College —- the women’s di-
vision, that is.

She scored 1310 points out of
a possible 1512 points in the com-
petition. ,

The tourney began with an
outdoor session, the Columbia
Round, and Ruth netted 530
points. That was good enough for
a fourth - place standing, 14
points behind the leader.

“That wasn’t too great,” she
said. “It was not up to par for

would show up.” n . 3 '

“I fooled around with it "af-
ter having it in phjs. ed. foii
years ago,” she said. f‘But I donﬁt
think I started until a year ago

And it isn’t too often thatone

I thought I could shoot better.”

The archers went indoors for
what is called the Chicago
Round, and Ruth pulled away
from the pack. She hit for 780
(10 points better than the male
champ) out of a possible 864
points and snagged the‘ cham-
pionship.

“I was quite satisfied with
that indoor score,” she noted.
"I hadn’t shot ‘a full indoor round
except for the Wednesday before
we went to New Jersey.”

“I put an extension on the bow
sight. That moves_the point of fuo-j
cus in front of the bow, and it
helps your aim a lot. I was sur-
prised when I didn’t see anyone
using one.”

Ruth really hadn’t had much
practice prior to the tourney,
either. a
