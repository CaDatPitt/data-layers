'-'66 Years Of Collegiate Journalism”

Court enjoins Forum ‘

by LOIS LEVINSON

The Forum newspaper was or-
dered. by Common Pleas Court
last Thursday not to print the first
in a series‘ of proposed articles on
_the University based on a report
.. allegedly commissioned by the

‘Q.-.ite Dr. Edward Litchfield, form-
, er Pitt Chancellor.

Judge Richard Wentley issued a
temporary order banning publi-
cation and set .a hearing for 10
a.m. today on the case.

The order had been sought by‘
attorneys for the surviving Litch-
f'ield children and the Litchfield
estate. ~ '

The document, according to the
Forum, had been written for pub-
lication shortly after Litchfield
left Pitt in 1965 but wasn't pub-
lished because of its controversial
nature.

Dubbed "The Litchfield Pa-
ers," the document ‘reportedly
disclosed details of secret trus-

Liteltfield Papers prilntingdelayed  

tees’ meetings and is allegedly

critical of the Mellon family and
other members of “the Pittsburgh
monied establishment.”

An initial hearing was called
last Wednesday night at which
time~Forum publisher .Tom Hen-
nessy agreed to delete from this
week’s edition the first install-

- ment of the report, which was al-

ready at the printers.

~ Hennessy, in a Thursday inter-
view, said this is a question of
freedom of the press andadded
that he has asked the~American'
Civil Liberties Union to intervene
in what his paper called “a local
version of the Pentagon Papers.”

Hennessy expressed doubt that
the Litchfield heirs would take of-
fense _at «the report since, he
claimed, “it is flattering to Litch-
field." _

The lawy.ers'representing the
Litchfield bid for an ‘injunction,
according to Hennessy. are Mel-
lon attorneys.

A Percy charges foul-up
lcosts Cabinet $500

by RON LOZOWSKI
Feature Editor

General Studies Student Cab-
inet Chairman Gordon Percy
has charged that an indiscre-
tion committed by Student
Services Specialist Bill‘ Len-
aghen cost the Cabinet an adi-
lditional $500 charge in the ar—

. rangements for the upcoming
 .~€5lsaac Hayes concert.

‘l

I

V .

 

 

Percy contends that Lenaghen
informed him that contracts had‘
been ‘received when such was not

the case, causing a delay in ar— A

rangements and creating a- need
for an outside agent to finalize the
expected date, Fe_b. 18.

PERCY
Costly Mistake

The promoter, Harry Popovich,
received a $500 fee for his serv-
ices, drawn from the Student Ac-
tivities Fees. constituting the Stu-
dent Cabinet budget.

_ Percy further charged that al-
'though Lenaghen had denied the
fact. Popovich had already been
involved with the affair. He ex-
_ lained that he hadearlier receiv-
~ed a call from Popovich. who al-
j.“ legedly related the message that

rg; the New -York firm responsible
‘lfor Hayes‘ .corre.sponde‘nce had '

 

' contacted him with the news that
» contracts -would beforthcoming.

Questioning. Popovich‘s connec-
tion with the concert, Percy said
Lenaghen had explained the call
a_s “a mistake.” ' ‘

Lenaghen is in Kansas City and
could not be reached for comment
on the charges.

Student Affairs Dean Dr. Af-
fred Moye said that Lenaghen had
apparently made "an error in
judgment,” and that this had al-
ready been admitted.to Percy.”

Mo_ve remarked that perhaps
Percy should "learn compassion"
in such matters.

He added that Percy had prov-
en himself "extremely rude and
discourteous in his dealings con-
cerning the incident.

“The document,” said Hennes-
sy, “has significant bearing on
how Pitt became state-related.
Litchfield had Pitt well. on its way
to becoming one of the best
schools in the country, but he felt
he hadn’t been supported with the
kind of money he needed.”.'

Hennessy claimed that before
Litchfield was killed in a plane
crash in 1968, he had taped a two
hour interview with a KDKA re-
porter. stating much of what‘s in
the document. He said the tapes
may be subpoenaed for the trial.

Although he’s not sure of the
vehicle through which it will,ar-
rise Hennessy is adamant that the
papers "will somehow become
pubhcf’

“Pitt students,” he stated, “are *
especially entitled to know about
important issues concerning their
school.” ' ‘

Asked if hehad ever encounter-
ed as much trouble over previous
articles, Hennessy replied:

“Never. I guess you can attack
the syndicate, but not the estab-
‘lishment in Pittsburgh."

Hennessy said he was not at lib-
erty to discuss the exact content
of the report or to reveal who gave
it to him.

Pitt ponders new deterrent ‘

At the University of Oregon’s Co-op'Store, shop-
lifting became so rampant that the stores manage-
ment begah turning over apprehended? thieves to
civilauthorities. , -

At Emory University in Atlanta. Ga.. the book-
store last spring hired three students’ to mingle
with customers and prowl for shoplifters.

The Dean of the College at Dartmouth, react-
ing to what he called “a disturbingly large number
of our students (who) have been apprehended. ar-
rested. and convicted of'Willful Concealment or
Petty Larceny . .  warned students in a letter of
the consequences of shoplifting.

As these examples illustrate, -shoplifting is a5

problem of mounting concern to campus stores and
bookstores across the nation. Here at Pitt,‘ the ris-
ing number of students apprehended with stolen
goods has led one administrator to propose that, as
at Oregon, student thieves be reported to city au-
thorities. .
SURVEY SHOWS SKYROCKETING THEFTS ~

A recent survey of 14 major college stores tak-
en by the National Association of College Stores in-
dicates that officialfears about the spread of‘shop-
lifting may be justified. ;

The survey revealedga 50 per cent jump in the

number of purloined textbooks during, the l970—71_

school year to about 1.8 per cent of volume.

“Inventory shortages” in trade books skyrock-
eted to 4.1 per cent of volume, an increase of about
173_per cent over the previous year.

Though not "included in the survey, local book-
stores are experiencing many of the same prob-

.\lary .\/lcGuirk. manager of the Duquesne Uni-
versity Bookstore. estimated that the store’s loss
to due to theft is about 1.5 per cent of total volume.

A 10 per cent discount on items costing $1 or
more has not kept Carnegie-Mellon University stu-

dents from spiriting goods from'the C-MU Book--’

store, reports its manager, Charles Floyd.

He speculated that, one reason for hisjsto,re’s"

speaks this Thursday at 8 p.m. in room 120, 121 Lawrence Hall.

. For the Party to be included on ,the ballot,
must be collected by March 8.

The Party platform calls for immediate total withdrawl ‘from
Southeast Asia and eventual withdrawal of all U.S. forces from foreign-
soil, as well as staunchly advocating women’s rights and the end of in-'
stitutionalized racism. V 0

- Spock has authored books on social problems, the war in Viet Nam,
and child care,_including The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child
Care. one of the best selling books of all time. In 1968, he was convict-
ed of conspiring to counsel evasion of the draft and sentenced to two‘
years in prison. An appeals court later overturned the conviction.

the prices of books and commodities are rising.”

Shoplifters at Pitt’s Book Center,‘said its man-
ager Mary Bonach, madeoff with about $40,000
worth of merchandise last year, about 1.5 per cent
of volume. 1

Though this is not a significant increase over
previous years, Bonach said, the number of stu-
dents apprehended with stolen goods has risen.

Presently, these students are disciplined  the , '

University—each signs a confession and meets with
Dr. Alfred Moye. Dean of Student Affairs,'to de-
termine what action ‘will be taken. _

Apparently alarmed by the number of thieves
apprehended, however, Moye has suggested that
student shoplifters be turned over to city police,

where they would presumably be treated no differ--

ently than non-student suspects. .

The 12-member Book Center Board of Directors .

will consider Moye’s proposal atyits regular month-
ly meeting Thursday.

Bonach said that this method. when employed
at Penn State, had dramatically reduced theft with-
in two weeks. ‘

Claudius, a charming man underéf,

other conditions, could not get
Valentine to recant, so on Feb. 14,
270, he clubbed him to death and
eventual sainthood.

Which was a happy coincidence.
if not for Valentine. then certainly
for the latter-day Christian fa-
thers. They decreed that the
Feast of Lupercalia would hence-
forth be celebrated in memory of
Saint Valentine, figuring that if
promiscuity must flourish. it
might as well flourish in God's

» name.

SWAN SONG: Floral sleighs yield to cardboard oblongs with gnome-like

 

by JOYCE GEMPERLEIN

It is only about three blocks (or
eight minutes during rush hour)
from Carnegie Library to Hahn‘s
Card Store in Oakland. but the
Valentines at either end are about
125 years apart. ,

A mounted collection of antique
Valentines gathered by Joe and
Selma Berger of Pittsburgh ha.ve
been on display at Carnegie Li-
brary since Jan. 28.

Each Valentine is hand-crafted.
some being over 150 years old.

The cards range in extrava-
gance . from one hand-inked on
white stationery reading in part:
“Let me catch the purple meas-
ure/Of_ thy harp of Love and
Pleasure,” to a three-dimensional
fold-out. Every spot on the latter
card is crammed with masses of
violets, pansies, and flourishes-
all edged with lace doilies.

Although the, giving of Valen-

tines stems in part from a belief,

that Feb. 14 is the date of the mat-
ing season of birds begins. the dis-
play contains only one card with
a bird on it.‘

Instead, rosy-cheeked winged

children soar above the heads of  ‘
two lovers who have just chanced

to meet—a woman in a Victorian
gown, a man decked in a top hat,
tails. and leotards—escorting the
hapless wanderers to a gazebo
nestled among the trees. ‘

“Kind and gentle, frank and
free,” the fretwork script often
reads, “She’s the valentine for
me.”

This 19th century romanticsim
has not, however. influenced the
majority of shoppers at Hahn’s.
Some extravagant, sentimental
cards can be purchased, but the
crush of people reaching for con-
temporary cards shows where the
demandis. '

Gone are the floral s1eighs'§'

drawn by swans. Gone are the

hand-painted antique verses. In-

,stead millions of 8x31/2 cardboard
oblongs with gnome-like illustra-
tions are offered to the shopper.

But this mass production and
uniformity of size does not re-

strict the creativity of both illus- .

tration and verse.

The market for valentines in
1972 has corrupted the 1880
verse: "To my true love—forget
me not,” to: “Got to thinking of
you yesterday . . . and‘I was at-
tacked by a heat seeking missile”
or “Just remember, Valentine,
when I say no . . . you’re stronger
than I am."

11:55 a.m. Five minues until
lunch. Time for the chubby man
in the light blue body shirt and
bright red apron to make a last
minute inspection of the scrump-
tious repast kept warm in several
large Dutch ovens in the first
first floor kitchen of the Student
Union.

  

The crispy cheese croutons in
the first oven apparently please
Helmut (no one calls the gaily
dressed catering manager of Sza-
bo foods Mr. Sefraneki. for he
moves on to the green beans al-
mondine, dismissing them with a

- peremptory stir of a large kitch-

en ladle.

_ The mashed potatoes are fine
also. so Helmut pro_ceeds to a
large pot hiding an aromatic mix-
ture of rich, brown mushroom
sauce ‘heath its round lid. He stirs
the sauce in large sweeping mo-
tions. Delicately he deposits a
puddle of the thick gravy on a plat-
ter, then daintily tastes it with his
finger. Pausing. he ponders the
flavor. He repeats the procedure.

" --Ti?-Something is wrong.

“Chrees, will you breeng me the

salt, pepper, and zhugar pleeze,”"

he demands crisply with an Aus-
trian accent.

Finally after some cautious
seasoning of the sauce and a cur-
sory examination of- sauteed
steaks and onion soup. Helmut
announces that the luncheon is

waiting in Dining Room A.
Helmut’s minute inspection of
the food is indicative on his philo-

sophy of food preparation.

“Cooking is not only a profes-
sion, it is really an art,” he says.
And the artist who has served
drinks to Jack Kennedy and Niki-
ta Khrushchev and has won ac-
claim from Jack Lemmon for his
vodka martinis, stresses that love
is as important an ingredient as
salt and pepper.

Not content to sit back and su-
pervise, Helmut often rolls us his

tastes all food that comes out

Fortunately, the prestige of
some of the establishments in
which he has worked has privi-

In addition to serving drinks to

various times for Queen Eliza-

you what his favorite cocktail is:

"It was said we were the only

people who could make them to

A series of Racial Awareness

Seminars have been conducted‘

throughout January and February
to enable administrators at the
University to gain insight into the
problems faced by blacks and
other minorities at Pitt.

The purpose, according to Walt
Fortson. who organized the sem-
inars. was “mainly to let people

‘ know about the problems concern-

ing ‘women andminority groups
and how to implement the goals
of the Affirmative Action pro-
gram’? -

According to Dr. Alfred Moye.
Dean of Student Affairs. the ra-
cial awareness program was con-
‘ceived by the Chancellor several
years ago when severe racial
problems existed on many cam-
puses. .

At that time, a series of sensi-
tivity training type seminars was
held for top level administrators.

The present Racial Awareness
Program. according to Moye. was
designed to reach administrators
at all levels of the University.

According to Fortson and Moye.
the program was not intended to
combat any specific problems. but

merely to foster a se_nse of aware-‘ I in

ness of minority group’s prob-
lems.

Fortson told the Pitt News that I I I

the seminars consisted of alter-
nating lectures and small discus-
sion groups. .

He also stated that most of the
participants felt that the seminars
had been valuable.

According to Eleanor Walsh, di-  I

rector of Student Publications. the

program was “helpful by present- 

ing to the administrators ideas of
the problems and tensions mem-
bers of minority groups face. It
was designed to make us more
sensitive in these areas."

Tedie Fakles of the University
Counseling Center found the pro-
gram “interesting.” “People got
to talk to each other and that
helps,” she said.

The seminars took place the .

last three weekends in January
and the first weekend in February
at the Pitt’Greensburg campus.

Someadvisers can tell you whether a
teacher is stimulating. knowledgeable. in-
novative, etc.

But most advisers have information on -

the strengths and weaknesses of only a
"limited number ofteachers. _ ’
And some advisers-will not ‘pass on such
information, even if it is at their fingertips.
Becauseassessments of teachers de-

pend to some extent on the biases of the ‘
observer,.,some advisers. are reluctant to

_ make comments about teachers. .
/Mary Teggatz. for example. refuses to
discuss faculty membersshe has not ob-
served in a classroom context.

Operating on the premise that a parti-

. cular teacher will excite some students

and turn other students off, Teggatz takes

all second-hand opinions on faculty mem-
bers with several grains of salt.

Another adviser, Ralph Pariser. is loath
to talk about faculty membersbecause he
fears they may hear about it. "If an ad-
visertells a student about the weak points
of a professor, it will get to the professor."
Pariser argues. He adds that. sinceall CAS

advisers aregraduate students who-de-‘

pend on faculty members for academic
' success, they must be careful not to step
on the toes of the wrong people.

According to Fred Koloc. director of”

the Advising Center. each adviser is free
to decide; whether to advise students on
teachers or not. ‘

So, you may have an adviser who will
give you advice on t_eachers,'or you may
have one who won’t.

But_even if your adviser is loose-lipped.

his store of tidbits on faculty members is
limited. 7 —

Fortunately for perplexed students.
each adviser is equipped with a copy of the

student-published Course Evaluation book.

The Course Evaluation book. which has
steadily improved in quality over the past
several years. contains valuable informa-
tion on courses and teachers.

Unfortunately, though the book includes

' data on a minority of the courses offered at

the University.

One reason for the low percentage is

faculty skepticism towards the mechanics’

of Course Evaluation and, indeed. towards
the very notion of Course, Evaluation.

In the past, s-uch skepticism was jus-
tified.

Oftentimes. the synopsis did not jibe 
with'the data about it. and many faculty 
members were understandably peeved.
since many students merely read the sy-
nopsis and didn’t bother with the numerals.

In the new Course Evaluation book, this

problem has been remedied, as the ran-  _

Thus. the new Course Evaluation book _. .

~ This letter is written to clarify

from Dave Shukis and James Pav-
el in the Feb. 9 issue of the Pitt
News.

.The letter in question dealt with
the current formation of a Pub-
lic Interest Research Group here
at.Pitt and the would-be “coer-
civeness” of such an organization.
To the University community in
general and to Mr. Shukis and Mr.
Pavel in particular I say: '

~— A The allusion to the idea that this
organization is Ralph --Nader’s
PIRG group is totally false. Mr.
Nader’s only connection with the
group was in.its conception; and

Singleton said he believes in ‘

some misconceptions in the letter A

ed at see,d_.that' took -root here in the
Pil.tSbll‘7I=‘}:’..h. area: In no. way, shape b

   

“Violence complicates issues

_rather than clarifying them."‘,"he

said. “Guns kill people but not
ideas. Pacifism,” he said, "is the
constant attempt to resolve con-
flict’ through raising issues and
then dealing with themin a crea-
tive way. There is a beauty and
strength in pacifism ; . . and the
draft is amachine whose only pur-
pose is death.“

Critics of a policy.of amnesty
emphasize the political aspects of
the question. They say that draft
resisters and deserters have vio-
lated the law and should be pun-
ished. Regardless of moral im-

plications. they say that all laws

should be obeyed and that the citi-
zens dolnot have the right to obey
some laws and disregard others.’ -

But does law, by its mere exis-
tence, imply ‘justice? There used
to be laws in this country that
prevented black people from eat-
ing in the same restaurants as
whites. St. Thomas Aquinas said,
“Human law does not bind a man
in conscience, and if it conflicts
with the higher law, human law
should notbe obeyed.” ‘

or form can the group be called
"his."

To assume, as Mr. Shukis and
Mr. Pavel do, that the students
give this idea a minimal amount
of thought when signing the peti-
tion is a totally invalid assump-
tion.

Any one of our petitioners will
attest to the fact that getting stu-
dent signatures has not been an

easy job. It hasibeen our experi-

ence that students are in fact giv-
ing the idea a considerable
amount of thought before signing.
(Our total is now 8.500. )'

I ask the authors of the letter

how they can refer to PIRG as a-

non-university group. I think that
they would agree that a university
could not exist without. students.

‘Even though PIRG -was i_nit_iate_'d.

The question of amnesty may be

one of the emotional issues of the
presidential campaign, especially

when one takes into consideration

the potential impact of the new
youth vote. , I
President Nixon answered the
question with a firm no at a press
conference in November. Senator
Edmund Muskie. the leading
Democratic contender. believes

that the issue should not be con-.

sidered until th'e.war is over.

Other Democratic hopefuls, Sen-
ator George McGovern and May-

or John Lindsay, have taken a-

more lenient stance on the ques-
tion. If elected, they would grant
amnesty to all draft resisters with
the provisionthat it be coupled
with compensatory military or
civilian federal service. McGov-
ern would not, however, give am-
nesty to deserters.

This raises another moral ques-
tion. Should a distinction be made
between the resister and the de-
serrter‘?

If a given draftee does not have

Write-On:

by RICH EULER

Is Write—On a parasite capital-
izing on the apathy of the college
student toward his personal edu-
cation or is it an outlet through
which the student can compensate
for deficiencies in the educational
system? _

This argument has been raging
ever since the inception of the 10-
cal "term paper firm" this past
summer. For the most part. opin-
ions have been negative.

“It‘s like prostitution.“ said
John Townsend. Pitt professor of
Physics. "It.‘s commercializing
something that’s basically wrong.
and I don't see how commercial-
izing it makes it any better.“

Michael Coon, president of the
local,Write-On firm, sees the sit-
tuation differently. ’

"The whole thirlg is similar to
the lecture notes that were intro-
duced several years ago.“ Coon
stated. “At first. these notes

aroused the wrath of the Califor— ~

nia universities where they were
introduced. but. recently. one of
the colleges actually bought the"
lecture notes and ,compared them
with the professors‘ notes to see
how they were getting across to
their students." '

_ Coon addedthat he hoped Write-
'On would eventually be recognized
as a valuable part of the educa-
tional system as well. I

g "People! tend to think of us
strictly as a supplier of term pa-
pers. but we have many other pro-
grams in mind."

One of these programs would
see Write—On supplying commun-
ity colleges with course pack-'
ages. These packages would out-
line content and structure. as well
as suggest teaching aids for the

. instructor. "

“Normally, I don’t favor this

type of educational control,” Coon '

explained, “but the situation in
the community colleges is pre-
sently so bad, that It feel a pro-
gram such as this could onlyhelp
it.” ‘ '

On a lessspectacular level.
Write‘-On is also supplying an-
notated bibliographies and com-

I , puter programs to those students

   
 

 

who desire them.

"We want to impress on people
that we are not engaged exclusive-
ly in the term paper business."
Coon said.i"We want to expand to
other areas of education in the fu-
ture. That's why we refer to our-

selves as an -Enterlearning Cor- ’

poration.“

Coon admitted_ that despite

' hopes for the future. term papers

currently remain the staple of
Write—On. At present. the local
office has approximately 10.000
papers on hand. of which roughly
3.000 are f'iIed away for sales
purposes. \ '
Also, if a student desires a pa-
per on which Write-On has nothing
available,’ -the firm can have one

Ideally. students are to use
these papers as research. or. at
the very least. to rework them be-
fore they hand them in. Write-
On‘s term paper recirculation po-
licy indirectly encourages this.

"When a student buys a paper
from us. he receives a Xerox copy
of it." Coon explained. "Unless
professors suddenly start accept-
ing copies for their assignments.
then the students aren't going to
be handing these papers in without
at least retyping them. Hopefully.
they will rework them as they re-
type them." 0

Coon added that, unfortunately,

this was probably not the case in ‘

a large number of instances.

Robert ~Whitman. chairman of
the English Department at the
University. said that rewriting
did not completely solve the prob-
lem. '

.. “Basically. we have a dual prob-
he said. "Obviously.
there‘s a rrforal problem. To hand

to do the research for their "as-

stance. ‘a working engineer would
prob_ably be too busy to do an Eng-
lish paper. especially since Eng-
lish is not directly related to what
he wants to do. As a result. he
comes to us and has the paper

Coon added. “I think it‘s an ac-
cepted fact that if you don‘t.like
a course you‘re not going to do

writing of papers is designed to
give the student experience in the
research process. The use of can-
ned research deprives students
of this experience.“

doing their own research.

y_ g""e6-—THE,PITT NEWS—Monday, February 14,1972

 

by LINDA SAVAGE

 “History is often taught as a

memory course where dates. nam-
‘s. and places are the bases of
" he course and interpretation is

ilf;-:.-ft for courses in English and

cience.
Not _according to Dr. Robert

,2 ‘Colodny, though. He has devised
 a process of historical thinking

that motivates history and puts

' ‘it on the same level as mathema-
. tical or biological thinking.

“The historical mode of thought,"
, iiesays, “has all the thinking of

the others.”
Since Colodny became a Pitt

 faculty member in the summer

‘of 1959, he has taught courses

 in history and the philosophy of
‘ science, and edits the University

series on the Philosophy of Sci-
ence. He has been interested in
history ever since he read books
by Homer and Tacitus, and others
about ancient Rome when he

' was a small boy.. Today he is par-

ticularly interested in the his-
tory of ancient Greece, medieval
Islam, and 20th century Europe.

History has an importance .that
to him has always been underes-

‘ timated.

- “People who do not understand
the history they are imbedded in
will always be aliens in their
own worlds,” he claimed.

He put it on a more individ-
ual level by explaining that ev-
ery human being in one way or
another has to make choices and
these choices depend on their
degree of historical understand-
ing.

He cited one example where
numbers of people have suffered
because history was neglected.

“The tragic involvement of the
U.S. in Indochina,” he said,
“was only possible because of
the vast ignorance of the social
region.”

Colodny’s philosophy on teach-
ing has two important facets.
First, “any subject taught should
include the philosophical presup-
positions underlying the presen-
tation” and second, “no matter
how. esoteric or remote the sub-

ject matter, it must show some-

meaning in the continuous world.”

He likens his students to his-
torical detectives and tells them
‘to receive history with the high-
est level of critical doubt. ‘In his
courses the students are assign-
ed “the problem of taking wreck-

age and- finding who is respon-

Through newsreels from as back
as 1920. he brings historical ca-
tastrophes back visuaily and lets
students see what actually hap-
pened. This wa_v they can eval-
uate the event and discover its
relation to other events in his-
tory. '

Colodny began his 20th cen-
tury Europe course by showing a
series of films dipicting the era.

"Learn how to fuse all of these

films together into one dynamic
mosiac. not in a static sense but
in a living sense.“ he said. "If
you learn how to do that. if you
learn the art of putting all of
that together you will be able to
fuse the 20th century together.“

 

 

Colodny trains historical Sleuths

Besides his 20th century his-

tory course Colodny also teaches
a Spanish history course. in which
he can draw on his own exper-
iences. A Loyalist soldier in the
Spanish Civil War. wounded in
1938. Colodny said. "We regard-
ed the Spanish conflict as a pro-
logue to WWII.“

In the decade that Colodny has
taught at Pitt he has observed

' that students are less willing to

sacrifice their personal lives for
scholarship.

But Colodny is impressed by
the growth of student skepticism.

“Ten years ago students ac-
cepted things as they were." Col-
odny recalls. “Now they question
everything."

New draft ceiling set

by MARY WELTY

The Selective Service Office has set an administrative process-
ing ceiling for this year at draft lottery no./200. This ceiling is a
temporary cutoff that may be lowered within the next months.

Men holding lottery numbers below 201 will be processed for

possible induction.

“Curtis W. Tarr.

Selective Service Director.

stressed that the 200 ceiling will be lowered as the military manpow-
er needs become cleared,” the Associated Press reported'in an arti-

cle last week.

Many lawyers speculated at the end of last year that the lottery
cutoff number would be'50 this year. According to the Selective Ser-
vice, the definite ceiling number may be lowered to"50, but this will

not be determined before April.

There are unconfirmed reports that the year’s total draft will not
exceed 40,000 in comparison tolast year’s total of 98,000. This would
lower the ceiling, since the highest number called last year was 125.

Anyone who has a lottery number above 200 this year and is
classified 1A will be reclassified 1H, the holding category for men
until they are 26 years old. The Service has also told 126,000 hold-
overs from last year’s draft pool to “forget about the draft barring

a national emergency.”

Credit by
‘ exam s

discussed

by SHARON SEXTON

The College of Arts and Sci-
ences. last week proposed revi-
sions in the credit by'examina-
tion procedure. L

If the proposal is passed by the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences. a
student may obtain credit for a
course by obtaining permission
from the department normally
teaching the course. taking a com-
prehensive exam and presenting
a $20 fee on passing the exam.

Dr. Jerome Schneewind. Dean
of the CAS. proposed the policy
which he believes will make it
easier for a student to receive
credits and thus “move more rap-
idly through ‘the University. de-
pending onlhow much he has al-
ready learned on the outside.”

"The proposal originally met
with a great deal of opposition
from various departments within
the University. ,«

Several department chairmen
said that the concept of credit
by examination conflicts with the
fundamental. educational goal of
developing a student’s potential
to the fullest. They said giving
a student advanced standing and
_then_working with him for four
years so that he achieves a high
degree of proficiency in his
field. is perferable.

Others stated that there were‘
things taught in their depart-
ments that could not be tested
objectively. ,

After a heated two hour dis-
cussion many of the representa-
tive’s fears were assuaged as the
Council granted that decisions re-
garding which courses would be
open for credit by examination
and the construction of the exam-
inations would be left to the dis-

cretion of the individual depart-

ments.

Discussion of the Black Stud-
ies Major slated for last week’s
Council meeting. was postponed
until February 25.

If you should happen by the
Frick Fine Arts building some-
time between now and March 15.‘
take a look at the back of the
cloister to the exhibition room.
where you will find one of the
most interesting collections of
eighteenth century drawings ever
shown at the University. The
drawings are by the family Tie-
polo. from the Stutgart and
Wurzburg Collections in Germany.

The father Giambattista Tie-
polo. and his two sons Domenico
and Lorenzo. compiled a collec-
tion of over 1_00 of the finest

-drawings in pen and wash. pen-

cil. and red chalk on blue paper.

‘A great deal of the drawings are

connected with the frescoes (paint
applied directly to wet plaster)
in the Royal Palacewof Madrid L
and the Church of Santa Maria.
del Rosario in Venice. '

Each drawing seems more ex-
pressive than the next. The ar-

' tists" drawings capture a moment,

or interrupt an action on the part
of a character and seem to stop
time. Characters are constantly

involved in motion, and the Tie-
polo family tries to capture the
most expressive part of that mo-
tion in their drawings.

Careful attention is paid to the
detail of objects like jewelry or
of flowing draped scarves. If the
only quality of a fine drawing is
to capture a mood or a moment.
the Tiepolo family most definite-
ly succeeded in doing so.

However, the quality of these
drawings varies. They are not al-
ways as fine and brilliant as one
might wantthem to be. The art--
ists seem to aim at precision and
detail rather than brilliance.

Our, University Art Gallery has
been selected as one of four Un-
ited States sponsors. of this exhi-
bition. I sincerely urge all art
enthusiasts and even those who
are not. to take the time to see
this exhibit and to support it by
purchasing one of the beautiful
catalogues la bargain at $3.00

As the opening credits for The
Trojan Women flashed on the
screen at the Shadyside Theater.
I anticipated a movie of unequal-
ed excellence. With a screen-
play adapted from the Greek tra-
gedy by Euripides and a cast
which included some of the most
dynamic international actresses.
I could not possibly imagine how
the production could falter. But
falter it did.

Director, Michael Cacoyannis.
who also co-authored the screen
adaption. somehow managed to

‘ transform this classic from a pow-

erful denunciation of the barbar—_
ity and futility of war tolan un-’
inspired melodrama. The movie
cries out for the need of a good
director‘s firm and guiding hand.

Cacoyannis. who scored a ma-

- jor triumph in his casting for the

film. fails miserably in his dir-
ection. Each one of his stars seems
to becompeting for dramatic hon-
ors, and as a result. the entire
play suffers terribly.

The action of the film takes
placegbetween the time of the fall

‘Trojan Women’ trammeled tragedy:

 

of Troy and the departure of the
Greek fleets. All the Trojan men
have been killed and the women
of Troy await their fates at the
remnants of the once great city.

_ Euripides. unlike other Greek
tragedians of his-time. centered
the tragedy not around the glor-
ies of »the_ victors. but I. the suf-
ferings of those they defeated.

The less than noble side of war ’

is shown—the senseless pillaging
and ransacking of Troy. the ab-‘

ductions of the Trojan wives and

women. and the brutal slaught-
ers of young and innocent chil-
dren.

As Hecuba. Katharine Hep-
burn is thoroughly disappoint-
ing. The aging and fallen Queen

, of Troy is the power and strength

of the play. It is through her that
we see the actual terror and sav-
agery of the Greek army. She has
not only lost her husband and
sons but she is enslaved and forc-
ed to leave her beloved home-
land. '

Clearly-the role is a demand-
ing one that requires an emotion-

4 al involvement with the audience.

Unfortunately, Hepburn and her

 
 

 
   

incessant tears never seem to ac-E.

fcomplish that involvement.

Cassandra (Genevieve Bujold)‘. 
the insane but prophetic daugh-§

ter of Hecuba. is’ depicted asfa"

ranting and raving ‘young gi_rl._ .
The scene in which she, atterripts A

to escape from the Greek sold-“

4-iers. was extremely awkward; '

more comic than tragic.

The acting honors for The Tro-13”)’
jan Women would have to go to _

Vanessa Redgrave and Irene

Pappas. as Andromache and He1- - '1

en respectively. Especially con- ‘

vincing was Pappas. as the de- ; 

ceptively beautiful woman .ove'r;
whom thousands of ‘lives were lost

There is no dramatic solution

to The Trojan Women. nor is one 3,‘

necessary. The plot has given way-

to Euripides’ theme of destruc-"

tion and senselessness. .

There will be many people

who will commend Michael Ca-
coyannis for putting this classic
on the screen. I will not be one

of them. _
. Whether it was done

deliberately or not, Cacoyannis‘.

Trojan Women is only a parody . '

of the ancient Greek classic.

For their encore ELP do "Nut-
rocker" an old fifties song orig-
inally done by B. Bumble and the
Stingers. While it's not exactly in
keeping -with the rest of the al-

bum. it is the only logical choice I
for a single and is sure to be ex-

tremely popular.

When considered. it  hard not
to be amazed by Emerson. Lake

and Palmer. For just three guys

they make an awful lot of music
(not noise like Grand Funk). Even
more amazing is the musical abil-
ity of these individuals. Carl

Palmer is one of the best drum-

mers around. Certainly the best

"side of Keith Moon of the "Who."

‘ Greg Lake played guitar for 1.0
years before taking ‘up bass and
no matter whathe is playing he

shows fantastic talent.

Unfortunately. word of Bill Knights tremendous ability

Most importantly, the Panther quintet has not played in _

three vital areas this year—New York City, Philadelpha, and the
West Coast. All three regions possess a strong influence on rat?
ings and rankings because of the many writers and publications

in these areas.

Christmas holiday tournaments also provide teams and in-

" ‘ ’   ' tion in the local Steel Bowl did not en-
hance Bill’s‘reputation——local fans and
writers already knew ofhisability.
Panthers fans continually marvel
at Knight’s fluid play all over the

Rival coaches have praised him throughout the season.

Some excerpts: \-

Roy Danforth. Syra,cuse'—3‘One of the finest sophomores I9

have ever seen. He shoots well,.rebounds well and has the knack

to be in the right place at the right time.”

Tom Davis, Lafayette——"He_ is a great player; if people
want to see a potential super star, there he is.” _ _
-Sonny Moran, West Virginia—“One'of the best forwards

I’ve seen this year.”

Pitt Coach Buzz Ridl, a 1968 member of the Selection Com-
"Bill has a good chance—it just depends on

mittee, says that
the competition.”

Knight recognizes ‘the awesome amount of good ta-lent in
the nation.‘ “It sure would be great to play.” smiled the humble
star, “but'I don’t know. There are a lot of great forwards in the

country.”

The Pitt News sports staff realizes that Billy Knight is just ‘

one of many-talented amateur basketball players in the nation.
He will ultimately have to earn a spot through merit at the try-

outs, a formidable task.

. We and all -Panther fans hope that Knight has the chance to
prove himself to the Committee. We already know him to be a

“The same, thing happened two years ago.“ in-

of the Field House Saturday night. 109-00. “They
made the game‘ a running game and wexwent right

through them.”

The -Cats went through them, around them and a

totalthis season. Two years ago they set an all-

himself. “We’ve got to play a little defense." he said

over and over again.

. Webster disagreed. “They play defense all,
right, but it didn’t look good tonight because we

were going through them.”

The vehicle on which the Panthers ran over
Syracuse was the determination of a revised line-
up spearheaded by the appearance of Mickey Mar-

ing assignment of the season and made the best of
it, thrilling the 2.500 fans with his 26 points and sev-

Tim Grgurich's basketball Cubs suffered their second straight loss
at the hands of Robert Morris this season and only their third overall.

Ron Hightower (21 points) and

game because of injury and Mar-

because of foul trouble.

Marshall had one of the best
games of his career as he set a
new Robert Morris rebounding
record at 26—to go along with his
27 points.

Kirk Bruce got himself into ear-
ly foul trouble (four in the first
half) but still managed to tally 18.

The Cubs were in the game most
of the way. With seven minutes
gone in the contest. the score was

Tracksters

by JANICE BUCCIGROSSI

The Pitt tracksters did a first class dedication
job at the opening of the new Williamsburg Field
House at Saturday's William and Mary Invitational
Meet. shattering two existing W&M records.

Steve Hein, Pitt's star shot putter. hurled the
shot 55-73/4. outdistancing the old mark of 45-612 by
more than 10 feet.

"I was quite pleased with Steve's perform-
ance." said assistant track coach Don Mollenauer.
“He was very consistent out there—four out of his
six shots were between 55-6 and 55-8."

Dorel Watley and Rick Jackson both smashed
the record in the 600-yard run. Capturing first with
a l:l2.7 was Watley with Jackson coming in second
with a time of 1:14.23.

“Both runners did a marvelous job.“ related
Mollenauer. “William and Mary’s track isn’t the
kind that you can get fast times on. It‘s 12 laps to the
mile and it’s not banked on the turns.

“You can’t get the times like you can at Pitt‘s
Field House. The times may seem mediocre but
they’re not—Watley’s run for example would prob-
ably be equivalent to at 1210.0 in the Pitt Field
House."

Although the mile relay team of Watley, Rich
Weaver, Ted Bobby, and Jackson didn’t break any
records and only placed second in the event, Molle-
nauer was still extremely impressed by the team’s
performance. ’

“I was very pleased with their spirit. The relay
was the climax of the meet—they were matched
with three club teams which consisted of star run-
ners from all over the country.

“The Brooklyn Over the Hill Athletc Associa-
tion, who won the event with a 3223.6, was out for

shattering  

l the worlds record on this kind of track. If Rick
Jackson had not been fouled by a Norfork State a

runner ‘in the last leg. which caused him to lose a
couple of seconds. we could have come even closer
to first place."

Other Pitt tracksters who placed were: Andre
Harris coming in third in the’50-yard high hurdles
6.3; Bob Schurko finishing third in the 1000-yard
run in 2:l6.9; Mike Schurko, fourth in the mile with
a 4:l4.4; and Dave Szabat taking fifth in the two
mile.

Pitt‘s next track competition will be tomor-
row night against Indiana State at the Field House.

baslietballaction
hampered by weather‘

by PAUL DeVITO

Yesterday afternoon at Trees Hall. five intramural basketball.‘

games were scheduled. Possibly due to the poor weather conditions.
only six of the 10 teams were present. Not present were they highly re-

garded Physics and Econ I teams who are both fighting for playoff V

bids.

The first of yesterdays games
pitted, Ed ‘Research against
GSPIA. The game was a see-saw
battle throughout with the lead
changing hands quite often. Fin-
ally. as time was running out. Ed
Research managed a three-point
play which turned out to be the

 

TC 234 zone For b_v rolling off a pick 

for an open shot.’

~ The final score was 66-21. with 

Horlick's 37 points high for Pan-

ther House while Judd led TC 234 I» ‘ 

with 14 points.
The final game of the afternoon

had the General Studies Nites 

winning margin.

The final score was 60-57. Ed
Research over GSPIA. Pacing the
balanced Ed Research attack was
Feller with 20 points and Cox with
16 points. Ransford led GSPIA
with 18 points.

The second match had the high
scoring Panther House meeting
TC 234. Panther House, led by
the outside shooting of Benje Hor-
lick, was able to handle TC 234
without much trouble due to ac-
curate shooting.

against the Generals in' a relative-

ly slow moving ball game. with 
final score General 47. Nites 35. 
High scorers were Kahn with 20’ y ,
points for the Generals and Dugan - I" 
17 points for the Nites.
