the Stephen Foster Memorial’s meeting yesterday.

BY GEORGENE KALEINA

The University Plan, a com-
prehensive. five-year planning

fgaproposal, was unanimously. ratiﬁed

«’ at the winter meeting of the Board
of Trustees yesterday.
The plan is a “mechanism for
projecting the future implications
of current decisions, for suggesting

the directions programs should.

take, and for specifying actions
required to achieve institutional
goals," according to the introduc-
tion of the 214-page document.’
Coveringall the elements of the
University from Pitt’s goverance,
finance and organization to acade-
mic programs, research and
regional campuses, the plan is one
part of a four-part system that will
also include the planning and

‘Wphysical

facilities plan and a
computerized management-infor-
mation system.

Faculty Bargaining On  
Slate for Senate Council

BY W. JACK ROMBERG

The University Senate will
sponsor an open meeting on faculty
collective bargaining, the Senate
Council decided Monday. ,

Physics professor Allen Janis,
who introduced the motion,’ main-
tained it was the responsibility of
the Senate to hold a ' neutral
meeting to which spokesmen for
and against collective bargaining
would be invited.

Graduate student representative

_William Voharas also supported

the motion as a means of

transmitting information.
“It’s the only chance the

students will have to hear or

express anything on the issue,”

i . Voharas said. ~
Opposing the motion, Council,

President William Brown said he
doubted the Senate meeting would
be neutral. He said some of the
union speakers invited, pro and
con, may feel that the meeting was
“stacked” against them. 1
Though the motion was passed,
no definite date or schedule -of
speakers was set for the meeting.
. Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar
introduced a proposal to establish
at the
University. Its function would be to

assist those conducting research at -

the University in acquiring federal
grants. It also would correlate
projects at the University so that
investigators in different depart-
ments would be aware of what their
colleagues were doing.
* “Almost all great research
universities have someone doing
this function to a degree greater
than the individual .(investigator)
concerned,” Posvar said_. '
English professor Richard Tobi-
as objected to the proposal on the
grounds, that it was merely

‘introducing’ another layer of

bureaucracy by which research
projects-would have to be approv-

Alexander Sights ERA s  

BY" LORI VALIGRA

1976 ﬁnds the “feminine
eyes” with a spit in one eye and a
tear in the other, journalist, author
and TV commentator Shana Alex-
ander said last night in Carnegie
Insitute’s Music Hall.

The spit came with the defeat of A

the Equal Rights Amendment
(ERA) in 16 states and with the
coming of the International Wo-
men's Year, which Alexander
called an international disgrace.

The ERA cites discrimination in
the basis of sex as illegal.

“T-he ERA is good for women,
and most people know this,”

. Alexander said. “lthink the forces

against it must be powerful and
well-organized," she added.

‘The Harris Poll showed 70% of
Americans supportthe ERA, while
15% oppose it and another 15%
had no response, according to
Alexander.

“l have an undocumented
assumption that business opposes
the ERA.” Alexander emphasized,
“since business benefits from.

But business alone could not
defeat the ERA, she admitted.
“Another powerful force against
the ERA is the fear inside a
woman's head to lose what power
she has,” she sai‘

~ usefulness of the office,‘

“The vice president for research

at Lehigh.University is a former, I

offices do.”

‘Posvar asserted, however, that

to eliminate the plethora of other

offices already dealing with" re‘- 1* .

search.

Student Government activities,

of recent weeks were reported by '.

Student Government Board Presi-
dent Larry Platt. Platt cited three
areas in which Student Govern-

ment wants a grievance procedure:‘. 1

student accounts, student workers

and the housing contract.

Platt claimed the University is

not living up to its obligations ‘as a ««

landlord. ' '

“Thefstudent is ‘obliged to pay.

for damages within the vicinity
even if there is no- proof that the
student was responsible,”
said.

Platt also reported that _the‘.l -Q

Resident Student .Association

(RSA) had participated in helping 
draw up the housing contract for" 

next year. A dispute arose,

according to Platt, over a clause "

stating the University reserved the
right to raise dorm rates during the
contract period. But the clause was
removed after negotiations through
the RSA.

”70 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh”

What You Have to Eat

The policy that requires freshmen to carry the 19-meal-a-week -
cafeteria plan draws criticism from ﬁrst year students at the start of
every year.‘

_ Imposing such a rule on students has no justiﬁcation when seen from
the sti.1dent’s viewpoint.

The reasons given by Kinney J. Thens, president of Key
Management, Pitt’s food service contractors, have little or no meaning
to those who would rather eat elsewhere. ' ‘

Thens says imposing a mandatory meal plan on freshmen helps them

I ‘eat. This statement is obviously ridiculous since there is

little room_for choice when a student is locked in a 19-meal contract.
Ilhemandatrory plan ‘doesn’t offer students an alternative the way
Thens suggests. It forces them to eat cafeteria food daily for the ﬁrst
year.
Thens also uses the mandatory food plans to provide a ﬁnancial base
on which the University food service operates. While this arrangement -
is. beneﬁcial to the food service, it nevertheless imposes on Pitt

= ‘freshmen who would rather have the option to eat where they please.

After this second point is considered, we see the service’s corporate
paternalism in the ﬁrst point as an excuse to beneﬁt itself and ‘not the
student. ’ '

While the great majority of freshmen would no doubt still opt for the
19-meal plan, perhaps a change in the housing contract is in order for

, those who like self-determination at the food counter.

From Dec. 1, 1955, when Rosa Parks was arrested for _ not
surrendering her seat to a white passenger on a Montgomery,
Alabama, bus to the Poor People’s March on Washington that lay on
the far side of a tragic April 4, 1968, King exposed seemingly
innocuous local incidents for the moral issues they were.

In his decade of national activism, he aroused not only the thousands
who took part in his non violent marches but also a national

consciousness that had long been asleep to the needs of its oppressed '

citizens.

It is unlikely that without King’s fearless efforts—fearless as we now
know even in the face of threats from his own government’ s FBI—there
would have been the Civil Rights Act of 1964 orjthe Voting Rights Act
of 1965, two pillars in blacks’ continuing struggle to be free and equal.

King’s philosophy of nonviolent resistance, a direct adaptation of
Mahatma Gandhi’s labors in India, became a source of strength not
only for the victims of racial injustice, but also for those who suffered
because of economic inequality and the bloody quagmire in Vietnam.

His feeling for human hardship knew no bounds, and his acceptance
of the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize underscored his standing as an
international champion of the oppressed, despite the fact that his own
country was divided over him. . _ '

It’s one of history's ironies that Martin Luther King hinted of his own
end in his last speech, delivered the night before he was shot. He said,

' “I've been to the mountain top...I may not get to the promised land
with you, but I want you to know tonight that we as a people will...”

Eight years later, the promised land still eludes King’s sufferers, but
the spirit of the man, his labors and visions, still lead on. ‘

While I do agree that it is
necessary to have a “conservative"
columnist who will espouse unpop-
ular causes, it is becoming
increasingly obvious that Bill
Kalman is not the person you need.

He distorts facts, publishes false
and misleading statistics. makes
false implications, and. on occasion
(ie. when it suits his. purpose)
Kalman just—plain lies.

ln,his column on “Zionism ‘and
the Arab Loss" Kalman utilizes all
of the weapons in a convincing use
of an old tactic: the big lie.

False Claim: "The majority of
Palestinians were driven out

. beginning in November 1947.

‘Fact: In November 1947 the
Israelis were so harassed by the
British and so low on weapons and

.men that they would have been

hardput to oust a Boy Scout troop.

False Implication: “The Zionist

Fact: The lrgun was a terrorist—

organization (much like the PLO)
which was denounced by Zionists
of every stamp. After the state was
declared. Ben Gurion smashed the
lrgun.

False lmplication—The massa-
cres of Der Yaseen and Katamon
are cited as ifthey were products of
an official Zionist policy.

Fact: These massacres were
perpetrated by the lrgun (see
above) and were deplored by the
Zionists. _

Mr. Kalman claims that “Arabs
living in Israel have been and are
second class citizens." In
actuality. they have never had it so

Another election

Avoiding It Like the Plague

BY BILL MOORE

One week from today, hardly
anyone will vote in the Student

Government elections. .
The reason, simply enough, is

7 that no one cares.

Traditionally, The Pitt News, and
most newspapers, play ﬁrm father
around election time and tell
readers to cast off their annual
apathy and make their votes count.
Traditionally, the readers chuckle’
and go their apathetic ways.

Without naming names—and
chances are good no one would
recognize them anyway— the
majority if not the totality of
candidates are coming face to face
with the problem of voter apathy

and are running away, usually up

Belleﬁeld to hide in frat houses.

This year’s election, you see, ‘is
fast becoming a one-issue“cam-
paign—“Who, in their inﬁnite
wisdom, will the Greeks _endorse?”

Frats are great for meeting
people, making good friends and
wearing nice clothes, but as
deciders of elections, they just
don’t cut the catsup. In line with‘
the sense of rugged individualism
that ‘seems to permeatesthe Greek
system, frat men traditionally vote
en bloc. If the Interfratemity
Council Executive Board saysthey
should support Larry Platt, they do.

And they did. And he won.

In all fairness, you can’t blame
them. If only 1,800 of the
approximately 13,000 eligible vot-

ers are going to turn out, it isn’t

hard for the frats, usually aligned
with the engineers, to insure the
election-of_ anyone they wish.
Since, as -..is their legitimate right,
both groups ask Student Govern-
ment for money each year, it is far
better to have-friends guarding the
cashbox than enemies. The logic
there is simple enough.

As for nonfrat voters, 'some
people honestly believed the
election of Platt could even stir
them to action. “Give them a
president who cares more about
helping students than eating lunch
with the chancellor,” some pre-
dicted,” and the voters will take
interest.” '

But it is doubtful /the polls will '

be any busier this year than in the
past, and, unfortunately’, the Platt
experiment in mobilization probab-
ly will be listed as a failure.

The blame, ultimately, falls on
the 20 candidates vying for this
year’s votes. Name an issue and it
‘is a safe bet no one has raised it.

What concerns Pitt undergradu-
ates that isn’t illegal? Faculty
unionization? -Hardly. Quality of
Education? Rarely. Administra-
tive red tape? We gripe, but that’s
all. As with our parents, there is
only one thing we really worry
about-'money.

Tuition went up despite valiant

_—AraI)s in the Lap of Luxury

lowered the Arab infant mortality
rate. given the Arabs the same
quality of health care as the Jews
and there are now Arab members
of the Israeli parliament.

Compared to their brothers in
the Arabic countries, the Arabs in
Israel live in the lap of luxury,
enjoying the same rights as any
Israeli citizen.

Mr. Kalman goes on and on with
his false statements. but one thing
remains clear. While there is a
need for a conservative commenta-
tor. he should be a responsible
newsman who will check his facts
and not resort, to cheap propaganda
techniques.

“Letter to the editor

The Palestinians as Losers

This letter is a comment on Bill
Kalman's article “Zionism and the
Arab I.oss"‘which appeared in the.
Pitt News on Nov. 24. It is an article
which contains out of context
quotes and incorrect statements;
thus I feel some comment is in
order.

The author states, for_ example,
that Theodore Herzl saw Zionism
as a means of “...enslaving or
driving out the nonwhite, non-Eur-
opean population." In actual fact.
Herzl’s only concern was ‘the
national liberation of the Jewish

,ﬂﬁple. He was terribly depressed

“with conditions in Europe, espe-
'cially in light of the pogroms of
1881 and the anti-semitic overtones
‘of the Dreyfus case in France. He
does not appear to have been
particularly concerned about con-
ditions in Palestine, which was
then a province of the Turkish
Ottoman empire.

Kalman also quoted David
Hacohen as saying he would not
accept Arabs in the Histadrut

. (trade union). Instead of quoting

(without reference) one statement
from the 1930s, I think it is far more
useful to look at the situation in
Israel today, where Israeli Arabs

e Histadrut members and are

"-2 4f‘i('l on a completely equal\basis

with Israeli Jews. Arab ‘workers

from the West Bank and Gaza also
receive Histadrut-scale wages.

The author also refers to what he
claims was the ‘driving out of the
- Palestinian Arabs from thecountry
by the Jewish and later the Israeli
community during the time of the
U.N. partition proposal and the
ensuing war of 1948-49. I would
like to refer here to Christopher
- Sykes, a British author who has
spent many years with the British
diplomatic corps, and has never
been known as “pro-Israeli." In his
l":‘~;ETl-known book, Crossroads to
Israel (1973), he wrote that “In
after years, Arabs and Jews
accused each other of having
caused this terrible emigration (of
Palestinian Arabs) by calculated
'measure...but the basic charge
seems to be empty, and there is no
evidence of a long-standing and
agreed Jewish policy to evict the
settled population.” (p 353) Rather

the major cause for the emigration .

of the Arabs was the invasion of
Israel in May, 1948 of the Arab
armies of the neighboring countries
and the confidence that the new
state of Israel would be quickly
destroyed. One refugee noted in

3, __;;é Jordanian newspaper ad-Difaa
(9/6/'54) that “The Arab govern-
ments told us: get out so that we
can get in—so we got out. But they
did not get in." The ‘ London
Economist reported (10/ 2/ 48) that
the main reason tor the night of the
Arabs “...was the announcements
made over the air by the higher
Arab executive urging the Arabs to
exit...” The appeals of the Jewish
mayor of Haifa, Mayor Levi, to the
Arab population urging them to
stay are well known. Posters in
Arabic and Hebrew appeared
throughout the city urging every-
one, Jew and Arab, to stay calm
and remain where he was.

- Kalman noted in his article that
Q- 39 Arabs were murdered by the

...71.-irgun at the Haifa oil refineries on

December 31, 1947. This is simply
incorrect. The New York Times of
that day states nothing like this.
What in fact happened is that a
bomb went off near a group of
Arabs outside the reﬁnery. An
Arab mob then stormed the
refinery and killed 41 Jews by
beating them to death with pipes
and stabbing them with knives. Six
Arabs were also killed in this battle
inside the reﬁnery.

In reference to the killing of the
Arab civilians at Deir Yassin, an
incident referred to in the article, it
should be noted that this act was

-3;’/iétindenined by the- responsible

Jewish leadership in the country
and was carried out bythe Irgun. I’
do not think it is particularly useful

. to compare atrocities. [but in (1929, in

n v 

I33 Jews were murdered in the
Jewish religious centers of Hebron
and Safed and between 1936-39.
Arab bands killed 517 Jews. Not
only Jews were murdered. On
October 15, 1938 the. New York
Times reported that “Extremist
followers of the Mufti...are rapidly
achieving their aim by eliminating
political opponents, in Palestine
who are inclined toward modera-
tion." In the first week of Dec.
1947, 105 Jews were killed by
Arabs as the authority of the
British mandate was disintegrat-
ing. In January of 1948, 35 Jewish
students were ambushed and killed
and their bodies were mutilated.
That April a hospital convoy was
attacked en route to Hadassah

Kalman referred to the oppres-
sed status of the Arab minority’
residing in Israel today. He failed
to note that two deputy ministers in
the Cabinet are Arabs and that
there are several Arab members of
the Knesset (Parliament). Arabic is

an official language in Israel, and-

Arab pupils attend schools in their
own language. Many Arabs study
in Israeli universities. All this is in
contrast to the Moslem nations of
North Africa and the Middle East
from where Israel absorbed over
500.000 Jewish refugees who
escaped with literally only the

clothes on their backs. Certainly
the situation of minority groups in
Israel. both Arab and others, is
much more tolerant than in most of
the countries which voted for the
recent U.N. resolution.

In conclusion. I do share
Kalman's sympathy for the Pales-
tinians. However, if one notes that
in 1922 the British created the Arab
state of Jordan with about 80% of
the land of Palestine under their
mandate. and then the United
Nations offered nearly half of the
remainder to become a Palestinian
state. one can get come perspective
regarding the situtation. I think it is
unfortunate for the Palestinians
that they did not accept the
compromise of 1947 and it is
unfortunate for them that Egypt
occupied the Gaza strip and that
Jordon moved into the West Bank.
It is doubtful that either country
was much interested in the
aspirations of the Palestinians. I
would submit that the main

outgrowth of the situation of 1947
and the Palestinians are still the
losers. /

seats or a lavatory. but you can’t
beat the fare. H

As my brother (and part-time
chauffeur) pulled into the freight
yard, Chas and I laughed off the
many dire warnings we had
received from our friends, relatives
and Guardian Angels.

Freeze to death in a boxcar? Not
us. We were as tough-skinned as
rhinoceri. Get shot by .promotion~
hungry railroad detectives? Never.
We were as sly as weasels in a
hen-house. We’d make it.

HOW TO MISS A TRAIN

Sporting the scruffy attire

common only to hobos and college _

students,-we shuffled across the
rows of tracks. A group of
unshaven railroad men, wearing

- grease-stained overalls and little

»blue caps, hovered around a little
shack beside the rails.

“Howdy,” I said in an almost
secretive voice to one of the more
important-looking workers.
“We’re planning on hopping a
train going East. Have any idea
when one will be along?”

He grinned slowly and shot a
spurt of black tobacco juice out the
side of his mouth.

?‘I’ll see what I can do for you,”

I he said, and disappeared into the

weather-worn shack. In a few

- minutes he_re-appeared.

“There’ll be a train goin’ East at
11:30. It will be stoppin’ on the
main track to change crews."
That's all he said. With a final
grin, he climbed into a massive
Penn Central engine, and began
his day's work.

Another workman. who looked
like he hadn’t taken a bath since
the Golden Spike was driven into
railroad soil, sauntered up to us.

“Riding the rails. huh?"

“Yep. We’re goin East."

He nodded. “Whatever you
fellows do, don't ride in one of
them boxcars. You’ll freeze to
death."

Thanking him for his encourag-
ing advice, we sloshed across the
dreary, rain-covered freight yard.
Aftera half hour of lurking in front
of the main track, apwhistle blast;
announced the arrival of a train on
the East—bound rails. '

“This must be it," yelled my
brother, who was waiting around to
see us off. “Good luck.”

Chas and I each shook his hand
dramatically and waited solemnly

‘for the moment of truth. ' The train

chugged up alongside of us. We
shook hands with my brother
again. “See you in a couple of...”

But it just kept on chugging...
about a half mile up the track.
After a brief stop, the train pulled
away before we could say
“caboose” backwards..

Waterdripped down our grubby
collars as westood along the empty
tracks staring in disbelief.

TAKING REFUGE IN THE YMCA‘

Several hours later, after soaking
up some much-needed warmth in
our respective homes, Chas and I
returned to the railroad yard.

Nobody seemed to know when
the next train was going East. Our
last hope was the Penn Central
YMCA, where the conductors sat

YOII



around chewing tobacco, waiting to
get their assignments.

Strolling’ cautiously into the
“Y," we approached a friendly-
looking old fellow behind a desk.

“We'd like to go East," Chas
told him in a half-whisper. “Can
youtell us when the next train is
due?” Every ear in the place
perked up.

The gentleman quickly ushered
us into the TV room, where we
would be unseen and unheard.
“You guys just wait here. l’ll let
you know if anything will be
stopping here tonight.”

We thanked him, and settled
down in the thick black chairs to

“Excuse me sssir,” my voice

at us.

It was useless. I could barely

The conductor looked quickly
around, and a thin, sly smile crept
_ over his lips. “Listen fellows. I
promise not to see you jumping on
my train if you promise not to
remember talking to me."‘
lt sounded like a good deal.

HOW TO HOP A TRAIN

After catching the end of “Adam
12,” Chas and I grabbed our duffel
bag§ and slid out the back door of
the  The beam of a locomotive
sitting on the track cut through the

,;f.Agi_ark, starless night. We carefully
 “fnade our way towards it.
“All set, fellows?” our conduc-
' tor asked, climbing down from the
engine. We nodded.

“l accidently left the door to the
fourth engine unlocked,” he
chuckled. “You can ride in there.
Just lay low till we get out of the
station.” - ,

That's all we needed to hear. In
no time, there were two hobos
climbing aboard the last of the
train's four engines. No sooner

 

_ Jersey.

had Chas‘ feet left the ground, then
the train started pulling away.

_ It was like something out .of an
old Western. We sat in our
reclining engineer's seats, a
network of controls in front of us,
and_ rattled through valleys and
over snow-covered mountains.

Through the windshields in front
of us, we could see sleek new
Amtracks glide past us, and
graveyards of decrepit old boxcars
sitting silently in dark freight
yards.

At 4 in the morning, we ground

to a halt and the conductor sent his
brakeman back to inform us we had
arrived in Harrisburg. Two tracks
over, he told us, a train would be
leaving for Newark—where my
uncle had kindly agreed to pick us
up. '
After a few words of thanks, we
hurried across the dark tracks to
the big electric train bound for New
The conductor was just
climbing into-the lead engine.

“We're trying to get to
Newark," I shouted above the roar
of the locomotive. “Mind if we hop
aboard?”

He stared at us. “You guys work‘
for the railroad?"

"No.  I _

“Well then. 1 can't let you on.‘
he said. and went pabouthis work.

Chas and I had a brief strategy
session. Just because this guy
wouldn't give us permission to
ride. we reasoned. didn't mean he
would throw us off if we happened
to "sneak" aboard.

As the train inched forward.
ready to depart. we hopped onto
the second engine.

I

HOW TO GET NABBED

What a lucky break—the door
was unlocked. We crawled inside
and fell flat on our bellies. The
brakes let loose a blast of air, and
the train began pulling away. ,-

“We did it."' Chas said
triumphantly. “We're on our way
to Newark." Just as the words left
his mouth. the roar of the engines
turned into a purr, and we slowed
down to a crawl. Finally, the train
stopped completely and the door to
our engine flew open.

"Okay boys. let's go. There are
two officers waiting below for
you." Of all the dirty tricks. The
conductor had squealed on us.

Slowly. we picked up our gear.
and slunk out of the engine like two
whipped dogs. A bright light
shone in our eyes. "Have any
identification?" the Railroad
Policemen demanded gruffly.

We had been warned to be as
humble and apologetic as possible
to Railroad Detectives. Sometimes
they kill or maim. .and ask
questions later.

Chas and I went all out. After a
little grovelling. some whimpering,
and a lot of whining about being on
our break from college and visiting
my grandmother without enough

_money to pay for round trip bus

fare, we achieved our goal—they
couldn't stand to listen to us
anymore. .

Instead of holding us. one of the
officers drove us to the bus station.
He sped through several stop signs
and a red light as we continued our
sniveling and apologizing.

When we arrived at the bus
terminal, our police escort banged

In fact, he even likes it
here. Still planning to-become a
medical doctor, he's resigned
himself to the possibility of
studying at Pitt for a total of nine
years. This is the kind of kid who

at Pitt.

Likewise, Penny Lazarus of
Squirrel Hill'has adjusted well to
Pitt life. She admitted last term
caught her unprepared at first.
Midterm grades gaveher fits.

‘.‘Toward-the end of the term, I
had to study a lot to "make sure my
ﬁnal grades would be allright,"
Lazarus said, “but with time
budgeting, I still had time for fun."

She rushed several sororities
before finally deciding to join Delta
Zeta. A commuter, she said she
spends much time visiting the
dorm suites of her sisters.

“I'm getting what I wanted out
of school," she said, “Friendship
and interaction with other people

"made last term a good one.”

Academically, Lazarus 'said- she
misses close interaction between
students and teachers needed for
good education. '

“You.really have to go up to
professors and demand their
individual attention,” she said.
“This term I’m going to talk to
them more."

Lazarus, a self-designed music
and psychology major, said she was
satisfied with the beginnings of her
career as a Pittskie.

“This is where I belong,” she
said. ' '

At the beginning of last term,
Lazarus noted that Pitt had a poor
reputation among her friends.
After the term break, though, she
said many of her friends who had
‘gone to ’ other universities had
decided to come to Pitt because it
was considered a better school.

Bill Skidmore of Mount Pleasant,
Pennsylvania, agreed that last term
began precariously, took a turn for
the worst and then with hard work

relative success.

With intramural sports. parties
and fraternity rushes, (Skidmore
said he may join PIKA this term)
competing for his attention, it's no
wonder Skidmore's term was
difficult.

“I didn't think it would be as
hard as it is." the pre-dental
student said".

To Skidmore, the worst thing at
Pitt is the lack of contact between
students and teachers.

"You can't get enough of the
help you need when it_’s so
impersonal," Skidmore said, “And
most of the Teaching Assistants
I've had offered no real help at
all." -
Originally a Tower A resident,
Skidmore has since moved to an

.Oakland apartment to help a friend ,

who needed a roommate. Skidmore
said he ‘likes the change ’ in
atmosphere,’ but said he had no
harsh recollections of dorm life.‘

John Colosimo, an engineering

student from South Hills, said he
expected next term’s studies to be

a lot easier.

“The transition from high school
to college. was rough," he
admitted. “It turned out to be
more work for me than it probably
should have been."

Fraternity parties, the Pitt Judo
club and a part-time job take up
Colosimo's spare time. T‘

Colosimo said he liked the

“‘bigness" of Pitt, especially the

abundance of sports facilities, the
library and the -variety of classes.

To Jack McElewee, last term‘was
not a goodjone. He said he had to
hibernate with his books just to
make it through ﬁnal exams.

lntramurals, which the civil
engineering student widely partici-
pated in, were the best things he
found at Pitt. -

“I expected some problems with
my first classes here,” McElewee
said; “with more organization, this

for me."

Kris Fairbanks had a blast last
term. She was active on the
women’s volleyball team, the ski
club, with sorority. rushes, and, of
course, enjoyed a sprinkling. of
parties. The nursing student even
said she did well grade-wise, She
did so well in fact, that she should
be thrown out of this survey.

, Fairbanks is so fanatical about
Pitt, that she even said she enjoys
the cafeteria food."

"Maybe I'm just‘ too easily
satisﬁed," she said. V

Yeah, maybe.

Her one big‘ gripe is that there
are 'not enough basketball, tennis
and paddleball courts to go around
for Pitt's student body. Over-
crowded conditions on the existing
courts dismay her, but if that's the
worst thing about her college life,
she’s doing fine.

Joe Roberts of Punxsutawney,
did well in his courses, but it .took~a
lot.of sweat to make decent marks.

“Though three-fourths of the
professors I had were pretty good, I
got the idea that I really didn't
count as a person in my bigger
classes," he said, “but like
everyone else, I adjusted.”

Cathy Sirianni of Sewickly said

Most of The Pitt News’ sample freshmen, used to the lazy high 
school life, found their first term a little tough. “- ‘

not that she's a wallflower—she

“I was pleasantly surprised with v

’ Professor Kraut of Philosophy 3

and Professor Oka who- taught

“They. were both considerate '

One freshman, Cindy Gangone,
of Derry, Pennsylvania, could not
be reached in time for publication. I
know she’s hiding from me.

while admittedly limited in scope, 
offers a glimpse into the world of a

, BY DOUG GEBHARD

Morningsong, a local-based
band from State College, opened
the Student Union Lounge show
Monday night. With a combination
of acoustic andelectric guitars with
tight vocals, this band has a style
I'll call central-Pennsylvania rock,
a nice touch . of bluegrass so

Q everybody ‘can “get down” and
.country licks that everybody has

already heard.

The outstanding feature of the i

band is its banjoist-guitarist-
singer-songwriter member, who
‘has some real unleashed talent.

But what can you say about a band

I  from State College. Go Lions?

On the other hand, we had
Livingston (Liv) Taylor, a member

of a family that has wielded some —
, excellent people. Liv comes off as

something of a baby stork and Bill
Babbit. The Boston in him is

I impossible to miss. The thoughtful

approach to each song and his not
wanting to waste words is reflected
in that conservative New England

S ‘ speech pattern.

His'songs are not the sort of
thing you would expect from this

 .clam-chowder wonder, A blend of

jazz chording and folk phrasing,
,Liv’s songs are heartbreakers and

' smile-raisers at the same time. He

puts in his set a mixture of original
tunes, and a few unexpected ones,
too. .

Those expecting to hear “Caroli-
na Day,” “Over the Rainbow” and
“In My Reply” were, of course,
presented with those on a silver
platter. But Liv pulled off a few
unimaginable——“My Cherie
Amour,” Woody Guthrie’s “Car
Car,” Sam Cooke’s
Me” and “Rubber Ducky” for two

of his neighborhood friends.

You can’t imagine the electricity
of the crowd for a show like this
unless you’re a part of it. It
happens with a lot of people-
James Taylor, Joni Mitchell, Neil
Young, even Tom Waitts. They
have such a rapport with the
audience that things just go
click-click-click when the show

begins. It hapened with this man

as well.

The surprise songs were the ones
that released it. “Rubber
Duck_y”——-who the hell could pull it

off better than Big-Bird Taylor? All

Feld Ballet Yields

An Excellent Rating

BY A. IRENE SCHMIDT

There's not too much that can
really cheer a rainy January night
in Pittsburgh. But the Eliot Feld
Ballet did just that last night.
Good? When you wish it wouldn’t
end, you know a ballet is great.

Tuesday night’s production be-
gan with choreographer Eliot
Feld's first ballet, “Harbinger.”
There was no need to build from
there, but the ballet company did
just that. Feld choreographed each
of the three selections and the

at Y—IKC

broadened into gracious motifs,
while a precarious balance existed
between the main statement and its
counterpart.

A runaway display of technique
and skill had the audience holding
its breath until the final notes were
sounded. A taste of Bach and the
speed of a bumblebee’s flight made
for some exciting moments and
‘mere glimpses of the best yet to
come.

The «two violinists’ contrasting
styles were establishedduring this
first piece and it is interesting that
they complement each other so well
while playing ' so differently.
Zukerman is the staid Spartan who
withholds .the overflows of emotion
so common to a concert musician.
This does not mean that his music
loses any of its feeling. On— the
contrary the message communi-
cated is of a deeply felt
identification with the piece.

Stern can’t seem to contain his
reactions to the music he is
involved with. He grunts, groans,
wheezes and stands on tiptoe when
the occasion demands his over¥
emotional responses. _ Also he
sometimes presses a little too hard
on his bow in his fervor over the
piece. and the results are screech-
ing, grinding notes.

The Sonata in C Major, Opus 56,
for two violins by Prokofiev
demonstrated a variety of rhythms
and styles in which I heard a
strange mixture‘ of tragedy and
sweetness. The most beautiful
chords of the concert hid in the first

‘movement until the high notes

jumped out and made my spine
tingle.

. Quick pizzicato notes followed by
long. whole notes stretched into a
sort ‘of “Dueling Banjos” seq-
uence. One artist bowed a series of
notes and the other artist was right
behind, playing the note heard

' immediately before it-. Racingto ag
jfevered pitch the ‘movement, fdiedjf

1

*-.

choreography alone was enough to

The Band has come a long way
from “Rag Mama Rag" and “The

Sure, the old nasal twang is still
there, making their vocals still the
toughest sound in rock to imitate,
and the black blues still course
through each measure like life-
blood. But Northern Lights—Sou-
thern Cross exhibits a polish and a
restraint that is the obvious product _
of a long maturing process. _ _ .

another side of Zukerman—his

Ommadawn, Mike Oldfield.
Virgin Records, PZ-33913

This is ’O'ldﬁeld’s third rock‘
symphonic, written and played

practically by himself.

If some scoffed at the success of

Tubular Bells because of the bid
send-off it got from the film, The
Exorcist, claims against Oldﬁeld’s
musical expertise were soon
dispelled with the not as famous
but certainly more enchanting
Hergest Ridge.

What the third Oldﬁeld album

’ proves is that the composer can go

in just about any, direction that
pleases him.

Too often placed in the same
category with the middle European
synthesists (Kraftwerk not the least
of them), Oldf1eld’s purpose is
much loftier than trying to lull you
to sleep so that you don’t notice
what a miserable album you’ve
bought.

In the ﬁrst place, Oldﬁeld’s use
of synthesizers‘ is relatively re-
strained. especially in Ommadawn.
And no matter how much or how
little he uses them. standard
orchestra instruments form the
foundation for his pieces.

Ommadawn is a show-off record:
Oldﬁeld not "only plays just about
everything, but he captures a
milieu of sound from different

 Subtle as a Flying Mallet, Dave

Edmunds. RCA Records, LPL

Add to .your imitation grass,
imitation ,snow, imitation beef and

- imitation sugar this album of
 imitation music.

While the revival of music of the
505 has split contemporary listen-

 ers into two camps, one that
regards early rock’n’roll as back-

ward for our time, and the other
that sees it as a source of modern
rock's revitilization, it should not
be difficult to recognize the
difference between bringing back
an oldtune and pirating it.

Dave Edmunds, in Subtle as a

.4 3 ‘Flying Mallet (a good title—there’s
<31’, nothing subtle here at all), steals 12
, biggies from the Elvis Era, and in a

Mike Oldfield tour de force in

which Edmunds plays all the

instruments, out comes an album

 of songs that beg to be called
’ .replicas of the ‘S05’ finest.

Edmunds even does all the

i ’ vocals, going from Chuck Berry to

the Shirelles to the Everly
Brothers, and taking not only their
hits but also their voice patterns.
Many who are unfamiliar with
'rock’n’roll will be unable to tell
Dave Edmunds and Martha Reeves

apart.

Why even mention the songs he
does when each one not only has
been done better elsewhere, but
also hasiappeared in numerous

 oldie-but-goodie collections?

Edmunds, if anything, is a

decent curator in the museum of

rock music. He has taken old
specimens and dusted them off,
and has tried to place them in the
same setting in which they
formerly existed.

He adds nothing new. Every-
thing he places in the showcase as
an artifact of that lost time: the

5:, sleigh bells on “Baby I Love You,”
 the ‘sax in “Da Doo Ron Ron.”

One thing Edmunds should’ve
realized, though: There’s a big
difference between the animals in
the museum and the ones in
the zoo. And Subtle as a Flying
Mallet only feigns resurrection.

Ballet Cheers Rainy Night

(Continued from Pa;/e I0)
slanting off-stage lighting, their
dance was fiery, quick and
playful—like two imps enjoying
their stay in hell.

The spring-like feeling of the

entire ballet was especially notice- ’

able in one of the last segments, a
visual interpretation of “In the
spring, a young man’s fancy turns
to toughts of love.” Two male
dancers, playfully sparring on-

stage. alone. Soon, there’s a girl,
and from then on it’s a dance of
rivalry, whirling around her pastel

green form. In the finale they were
joined by a number of other
couples, and the extreme tender-
ness of Feld’s choreography was
first apparent.

Feld’s genius in this area
dominated the entire second ballet,
“Intermezzo.” He shies away
from solos. It is with the dancing
couple, the interaction of man and

woman that he feels most
comfortable.
Watching “Intermezzo” is

somewhat like witnessing an old-

‘ ties.
» relationships and plot into their

fashioned minuet. Everything is
courtly, graceful and somehow very
pleasing. After the first move-
ment, Feld presents a series of pas
de deux performed by three
couples, each with an individual
style. The first is like one of the
tender love scenes from an old
movie, without the corn. Every
gesture is perfect, down to ‘the
touching of hands.’

Ballet is ballet. It need not tell a
-story, the dance itself can be the
main attraction. But Feld has
injected his dancers with so much
individuality, and with frequent

I ‘touches of comic relief, so they

automatically become personali-
The desire to read

dance is overpowering. At several
times. the dancers seem really to
be fooling around. They turn their
skill to pantomimes of the can-can,
they finish amovement by kissing
their hands to the audience, they
bring laughs from the audience by
performing a stilted caricature of
stylized ballet.
It works for the Eliot Feld Ballet.

In the same way that Ice Follies
clowns must be superb skaters,
these dancers can dip into comedy
because their excellence is uncon-
tested. Several movements in
“Intermezzo” brought audible
“oohs” and “ahs” from the.

him on tours and for albums with

hold their own as a significant part

importantly, to influence the course

At a time when breakups and

of synthetics lifts Northern Lights

—Southern Cross out of the

“Forbidden Fruit” are good
examples, incorporating the

group’s liveliest rhythms.

“It Makes No Difference” is a
rustic crooner that could survive as
the hottest button on the jukebox in
a truckers’ bar along an Arkansas
interstate.

“Jupiter Hollow” shows off a"

funky electric keyboard worthy of
the likes of Stevie Wonder.

Only in tunes like “Acadian
Driftwood" and “Hobo Jungle”
does The Band lapse into its former
limited dimension. Not bad songs,
they’re not characteristic of this
album’s mainstream.

Northern Lights—Southern
Cross dramatically reasserts the
group’s self sufﬁcience. Though it
may play backup to a legend, in no
way does it take’ a back seat.

 Grapplers Undefeated,  

Due to 1 10% Effort

BY YAIER LEHRER
Associate Sports Editor

It was only last Friday that Pitt
grapplers embarked upon the long
ordeal of wrestling seven meets in
seven days. The Panthers left

Pittsburgh with a 3-0 slate, and‘

when they returned from the fourth
of seven meets at Maryland on
Sunday, that record was still
untarnishedﬁ ' '

On Saturday, the Cats competed
in a quadrangular meet against
Navy,
Princeton. The Pitt wrestlingtteam
had not beaten Navy in about 10
years, but that soon changed with
an 18-15 Pitt victory that was not as
close as the score indicates.

Kevin Nellis started it off with a

. victory over Dave Costello, 7-3', and

the Cats were never behind after
that. Craig. Philips and Rande

Stottlemyer shut out their oppo-_

nents, and Bob Bailey continued
his unbeaten streak in dual meets

'f‘_"i"r--with a 7-1 decision over. Dennis-

Gardener.

Bill Korth lost a decision to
Navy’s Rob Steiner, but Skip Bolin
came back and decisioned Bob
Althans, 6-3. Althans had pinned
Bolin only a year ago.

Bill Bailey and George O’Korn A

followed with revenge decisions
against their Navy opponents.
Both O’Korn and Bailey had lost to
these same wrestlers at the Penn
State tournament.

At this point, Pitt was clobbering
the Midshipmen, 18-9, but the
Panthers had to forfeit Milt
Schueler’s match because Schueler
had a twisted knee. Schueler joined
the team after the football season.

“It was just a super match,” said
Coach Dave Adams with the hoarse
voice of a coach who had just
violently exhorted his team
throughout four meets. “These
kids arejust great. When you want
100%, they give you 110%. There
are times in practice when I
actually have to slow them down.”

Adams didn't slow them down
against William and Mary or
Princeton, though. The Cats put

down the Tigers, 25-12, and the 1

Indians. 28-9.

Pitt started out in the hole
against William and Mary when
Nellis lost a 7-5 decision and
Philips also lost. -

Still in "the hole.'All-American
Stottlemyer was losing his match
with eight seconds left when
suddenly he turned and pinned his
opponent. giifing the momentum
back to the Panthers. The Cats

William and Mary and

lost only one other bout during the
rest of the meet.

“They got us in the hole in the
beginning,” Adams said, “but our
kids just came back with a great
effort. Talentwise, this team does
not match up to last year’s squad,
but they sure make up for it with
desire.”

After the third meet, the Cats
packed up all their desire and took
it with them to Maryland, where
they gave the Terrapins a harsh
28-11 thrashing.

“It’s easy to let down after you
have the good meets we had on
Saturday,” 1 Adams said, “but
these wrestlers worked on Saturday’
night after they arrived at
Maryland to get rid of some weight

‘that they put on after the three

wins.”

Nellis started it all with a default
victory, and the Cats began‘to roll.
Probably the most exciting match

for Pitt fans was Stottlemyer’s 22-5 _

crushing of his opponent, a
performance that included six
takedowns for the junior. Bill
Bailey pinned John Harvey of
Maryland while Milt Schueler lost a
heartbreaker when he was taken

down in the last three seconds of

the bout.

Stottlemyer, Bob Bailey, Bill
Bailey and Bolin were undefeated
over the weekend, -while Nellis,
Dallatoreand O’Korn lost only one
bout each. M_athematically speak-
ing, these seven wrestlers put
together a 25-3 record, awesome
any way you look at it.

“Things just seemed to mesh
this weekend,” Adams remarked.
"There is no question that this is
going to improve our national
ranking.” '

The Cats had been ranked 15th

in the country before the meets.

The wrestlers put their undefeat-
ed record on the line this weekend
‘when they participate in another
quadrangular meet, this time at-
Michigan. Michigan, Indiana and
Illinois State wil_l be Pitt’s
opponents. ' .

“The Big Ten wrestlers. such as
Iowa, Michigan or Indiana are
traditionally rugged teams,” Ad-
ams said. “They are physically
rough as compared to Oklahoma
State. which tries to finesse you
into the ground.”

These meets will be the finale of

' Pitt"s toughest test of the season.

So far. it has ‘passed through the
ordeal unscathedx It remains to be
seen whether the Cats will leave
Michigan in the same state..

Somehow. one is led to believe

One of the most interesting parts
of the evening was watching the
maintenance crew remove the
ﬂoorboards to expose the hockey
rink. ' _

After running off the first eight
points of the contest, Notre Dame
did just about what everyone in the
Civic Arena thought it would. But
the Cats wouldn’t ,be humiliated,
and lost by only 11 points, 77-66.

The Panthers‘ got their act
together, soon after the Irish
onslaught and closed the gap to
10-6. But then the roof fell in as
Notre Dame outscored the under-'
manned Cats, 18-4, in a tear that

Maybe it was the excitement
of playing the preliminary game to
the Panthers’ long-awaited contest
with Notre ‘Dame, with televisilon
coverage and‘ large crowds, that
gave the basketball Pantherettes a

little extra drive Monday night. At I

any rate, it’s a good thing they had
it.

' The Pantherettes edged out Ohio
State, 56-50, ‘ and it was a
hard-fought battle from the open-
ing tip-off. Tasting their. first real
competition since the Pitt Invita-
tional, the Pantherettes found that

the Buckeyes play a game quite .

similar to their own—defense-
oriented. OSU also had a height
advantage that presented prob-
lems. . _

“Kit (Loefﬂer) covered their
tallest player and she had four
inches on her,” said Pitt Coach Pat
Wallace. “We’re lacking height;‘
there’s no way getting around it.”

The Buckeyes had a 22-21 l_ead at
the half and came back to pull six

.points ahead before the Panther-

ettes finally got into the action.
Barb Welsh, who had picked ‘up
three quick fouls at the beginning
of the quarter, fired off a couple of
equally quick field goals, and th
team took it from there. '
The real starjof the game was, as
usual, Debbie Jones. The 5-10
center topped all scorers with 21
points, shooting 61%, and collected
18 rebounds. Welsh chipped in 12
points and scooped ‘up seven
rebounds. .
You could say the Pantherettes
won the game from the free throw
line, making 14 of 26 (as opposed to
OSU’s four of six); But statistics

i DeMuro Olympic Hopeful

‘BY RICK PETRACCA

This year a torch will be ignited
to commence the most celebrated
and impressive single sporting
event in the world——-the Olympic
Games. Mention of the Summer
Olympics should have Pitt sports
fans bubbling; the United States
could possibly be represented by a
Pitt athlete. . . .

land, the Panther starting center,
ended the contest without one
rebound. The top Pitt rebounders
were Frank Boyd, Willie Kelly and
Terry Knight, each of whom had
four.

The story of the evening had to
be Notre Dame forward Adrian
Dantley. The 6-5 strongman pulled
down ﬁve boards, hit 13 of his 15
field goal attempts, and made eight
of 12 free throws for a game-high
34 points.

Top scorers for the Panthers
were Kelly, Pete Strickland and
Larry Harris, each with '11. Wayne
Williams, who had one of his best

games both offensively and defen- ‘

sively, ended with a total of eight.

Trailing by 15 at the beginning of
the second half, the Panthers came
out of the locker room fired up,
refusing to be counted out. After a
couple of quick buckets by‘Harris
to bring Pitt within 11,, they seemed
on their way to making the game
close. But then Dantley started
shooting again.

The remainder of the game was '

played with all the intensity of a

-t one-point contest; the Cats closed
— _ to within nine points with less than

two minutes to go._

But the game was out of sight by
then, and the Panthersiwere leftto
-ponder their 4-9 record in the face
of another titanic battle with
Marquette on Saturday.

- “You've gotta be crazy to play

this game,” Jeff Saunders explain-
". ed. _
1 “It’s not like any other game.
‘ It's ﬁveftimes as hard as football.
The fastest human in the world
5 only runs about 15 miles per hour,
V but we skate between 20 and
30-,—-we're flying around.the ice.
We hit immobile objects and we
 have t9.watch out for sticks and

nothing to contend with except
‘ other human’ beings and a soft

As you’ve probably guessed, Jeff
. Saunders is a hockey player.
.:, Speciﬁcally, the starting center for
' the Pitt Hockey Club. And, as
. .you’ve probably also guessed, Jeff
. ,.Saun.ders is crazy, just a little bit.

' (And not just crazy in the
, conventional sense. Saunders is
: also an undeniable sports nut. At
V. Taylor-Allderdice High School, he
[ was All-City in football. And just
up two _years ago, Saunders was
acquiring a sunburn through his
~ catcher’s mask at the University of
;._ = Miami.‘_‘. After ﬁnding ﬁerce
' competition among an overabun-
dance of baseball players in
Florida, he transferred to Pitt.

Saunders has been playing
competitive hockey since he was
11 years old, since the formation of

 .   9 Warriors on

‘Starr and Tom Richards, the Cats
may have a chance in the lands of
the 10-foot snow drifts. But it will

take a_ lot more ﬁnesse than Pitt -

showed against Notre Dame to beat
the Warriors.

Marquette returns four starters
from a team that went 23-4 last
season. Perhaps the most notable
of these is junior forward Bo Ellis,
the 6-9 Warrior scoring machine
with a 16.3 per'game average.

Also among the Warrior notables
are 6-6 forward Earl Tatum (13.6
points) and hotshot guard Lloyd
Walton (15.1 points). .

Against Notre Dame, Starr sa
his ﬁrst action of the season. He
played about a minute, his only
shot bouncing off the back of the
rim. Richards didn’t see any action
because ‘of damaged ligaments in
his ankle. It is hoped that he can be
ready by Saturday. '

All in all, the Panthers have their
work cut out for them. The team

the Alpine Division of the
Pittsburgh -Amateur Hockey
League (PAHL). He found a place
with the Pitt Hockey Club in his
sophomore year, and he’s been on
the ice ever since.

“He would be welcome on any
team," Head Coach Len Barcalow
said. “Jeff is a hard-riding hockey
player. He's a Rick Vernon

type—hustle and bump—that’s the _

way you play. the game. He has
brains; he’s improving every game
out there. In other words, he’s a
good team player."

Unselﬁshness was not always a
part of Saunders’ ‘game—it’s _an
acquired virtue.

“I didn’t use to play this way,”
Saunders admitted. “In high
school, I was one of the few people
who could skate well and I was
called—you name it—a ‘puck hog.’
Now. the kids on my line, Scotty
(Kimmick) and Ged (Bill Gedeon),
are very good players and can catch
anything I throw them.”

Last year, Saunders was» one-
third of the feared “Kid Line,” one
of the most potent offenses in the
rink. The line, rechristened the
“Lumbo Bunnies" after the team’s
trip to New York, is still as
devastating. Saunders so far has
scored six goals and chipped in four
assists, as well as totalling eight
penalty minutes.

“I like the violence," Saunders
said. “I'll tell you the truth. We're
sick peopleout there. You have to

   

the Loose

shot well against the Irish, but just
didn't take the right shots, or
didn't take them often enough.

Larry Harris, who is averaging
20 points per game, could manage
only 11 Monday. His percentage
(5-9) was respectable", but to have
the team's leading scorer sit out
most of the ﬁrst half with three
fouls and take only nine shots the
entire game is almost unheard of.

The improvement of freshman
Wayne Williams‘ is cause for at
least a little cheer, but to beat a
team the likes of a Notre Dame or
Marquette will require a total team
effort. ’ ‘

As evidenced by the 4-9 record, a
team with good individual talent
can't win without all the players
sharp and efﬁcient. .

Especially when you're playing
Marquette in Milwaukee "with"
ll,000 fans screaming for your
heads.

   Saunders: ABit Nuts?

be sick to beat up people and to let
people beat up on you."

A junior communications -major,
Saunders doesn't rule out hockey
as a,_ career possibility, but is
realistic about the discipline and
devotion to an athletic life. ,

“I'd love to go on to pro hockey,
but I don't think I'll make it. Right
now, I don't have the time to
specialize and work on my skills.
The problem is, we don't get a lot
of ice time because we don't have
the money. ‘

“Like after the New: York trip,
we had two weeks of. vacation,
which was really more of a layoff.
It's not hard to get into condition,-
but it's easy to get out."

Because most of the Hockey Club
comes from the Pittsburgh area,
high school rivals often turn up as
teammates, as Saunders found out
when he faced his old opponent
from South Hills Catholic, Rick
Vernon, at his ﬁrst practice at Pitt.

“I wanted to show him he wasn't
as big and bad as everyone thinks
he is,” Saunders said. “He is as
big and bad as everyone thinks he
is. I went through the entire
season with a shoulder injury."

Vernon will not accompany the
team on this weekend's trip to
Cincinnati. That will deﬁnitely put
pressure on the Pitt offense.

But then, what's a little pressure

to a crazy Lumbo Bunny like Jeff.

Saunders?

Steelers to Gun Down

Doomsday Cowboys   

BY YAIER LEHRER
Associate Sports Editor

For the first time in a long time, '

the Super Bowl might even be
exciting. A

Past championship games have
been marred by ultraconservative
game plans that produce defense-

dominated games that could put_

the most avid fans to sleep.

This time, though, the wild card
Dallas Cowboys. will display an
exciting, versatile offense ranging
from the regular pro set to the
“shotgun" formation.

The “shotgun" is the nickname
given to a short punt formation in
which Roger Staubach, t_he Dallas
quarterback, drops back a few
yards to receive the snap from the
center, spots his receiver and ﬁres
it. When Staubach drops back into
the shotgun formation, the Steeler
defense can rest assured that
Roger the Dodger is going to the
air. The only problem is in stopping
it. ‘
Staubach is ﬁnishing his best
season in a Dallas uniform, having
completed 56.9% of his passes for
2,666 yards and 17 touchdowns.
When he was not throwing to his
backs Preston Pearson (remember
him?) or Bob Newhouse short, he
was unloading bombs to Drew
Pearson and Golden Richards.’ ‘

While Staubach had his best year
ever, let us not forget Steeler
quarterback Terry Bradshaw.
Bradshaw ﬁnally showed the poise
of a pro quarterback for an entire
season, giving credence to Chuck
Noll's conﬁdence in’ Bradshaw's
abilities all these years. Part of
Bradshaw's success is due to the

excellent hands of the second year '

man from USC, Lynn Swann (49
receptions for 781 yards).

Bradshaw had an even better
year than Staubach._ He completed
57.7% of his passing attempts for
2,055 yards and 18 touchdowns.
While Staubach had more yards
due to his B-17 arm, the Cowboy
also had more interceptions.

When these two quarterbacks
line up against each other Sunday,
ﬁreworks can be the only result.
Not only can they pass well, but
also they can run like hell.

Speaking of running, let us not
forget Steeler castoff Preston
Pearson, who ran for 509 yards this
season as partof a stable that
included Doug Dennison (383), Bob
Newhouse (930) and Charles Young
(225). Each of the Cowboy running
backs is also a dangerous‘receiver.'

And when speaking of running

backs. it's hard to ignore the best
running back in the Super Bowl this

‘year, Franco Harris, the ﬁrst black

man since Othello to command an
Italian army. Harris had 1,246
yards this season due largely to the
blocking of running mate Rocky
Bleier. The Rock led the way for
many of Harris' yards, while
contributing 528 of his hard-earned
yards to the Steeler effort.

And if you think the offenses will
be exciting, watch the colorful
characters on defense. _

The duo of Harvey Martin and
Ed “Too Tall" Jones presents a
furious pass rush, while linemates
Jethro Pugh and Jim Gregory
bottle up the inside, where Harris
has been known to bull for most of
his yardage.

The linebacking corps for thee
Cowboys is bolstered by Leroy

Jordan, an omnipresent threat to

any offensive maneuver, while
Dallas‘ defensive backﬁeld has
been completely revamped follow-
ing a poor showing last season.

While Jones and Martin put the
rush on the Steelers, the Cowboys
will have a helluva time protedting
Staubach from the likes of LC‘.
“Hollywood" Greenwood and
Dwight “Mad Dog" White as they
rush from the ends while Mean Joe
Greene and “Fats" Holmes charge
up the middle.

If the line doesn't get to.
Staubach every time, chances are
his passes will fall incomplete
against one of the best pass '
defenses in the NFL.

Linebackers Jack Ham, Jack‘

Lambert and Andy Russell provide
strength and maneuverability be-
hind the line, while the defensive
backﬁeld, led by Steeler MVP Mel
Blount (11 interceptions), Mike
Wagner (four), Glen Edwards

(three), and J.T. Thomas (three), 

provides an almost impenetrable
defense against the pass.

The game promises to be a
matchup between Harris and the
Cowboys’ stable of healthy run-
ners, Bradshaw and Staubach, and
overall, the Steel Curtain and the
Doomsday Defense.

There is really no question that
Pittsburgh is the superior team,
but it will have to avoid the
abundance of mistakes it has made
in the playoffs against Baltimore
and Oakland. The opportunistic
Cowboys will take advantage of
every mistake.

It's gonna be close,
Pittsburgh should win by at least
five.

Nellisin Center Ring

BY JIM LEWIS

Question: What is the one thing
for which all coaches, managers
and athletes all over the universe
strive?

NO, not a bigger budget—im-
provement.

Improvement. That's the dream
of all sportsmen and avid fans in
America. To constantly get bigger
and better as each season comes

' along.

And to someday reach the
tOp—the peak of the mountain, if
you will—a plaeevwhere there is no

,.~-7--longer room for improvement.

Such is the case of Kevin Nellis,
starting 118-pound sophomore of
the 15th-ranked-and-still-climbing
Pitt wrestling team.

Last year, as a freshman, Nellis
compiled a 9-4-1 overall record,
including a 3-2 tournament per-
formance. ‘

Pretty good for a first-year man.

But the real question is, has he
improved? Listening to Nellis, you
wOuldn’t think so.

“Early in the season, Iwas doing
okay," Nellis said, “but I know I
got a lot of work ahead of me. The
bulk of the schedule is coming
up—Penn State, Lock Haven and
Clarion.” .

Actually, Nellis is improving. He

/has run up a 5-1 record this season,

not to mention a third place in the
rough Wilkes Tournament.

He considers Assistant‘ Coach
George Bryant the catalyst of his
maturing ability. “Bryant is
helping out a lot,” Nellis said.
“Having someone tough to work
out with makes you better.”

Yes, Bryant and Head Coach
Dave Adams deserve a lot of credit
for bringing some of the best
wrestling in the nation to Pitt. But
Nellis points out another important
factor in his and the team’s
improvement over last season.

“This year, we got rid of some

"kids who didn’t have a very good
attitude,” Nellis said. “But now,

everyone ﬁghts all the way through
every match. NO one gives up. It
seems we want to win a little
more.” ‘

Despite the sudden surge‘ of
enthusiasm, no one in his right
mind could have honestly believed
the Panthers ever would own a

fantastic 7-0 record and a share of p

the national rankings—-not even
Nellis.

“I knew it would be a lot of work
to change the team around,” he

‘ said. “Now we’re rallying forward

all the way. Every match, the
momentum is carrying. If we win a
couple more big matches, we could
get into the top two of the Eastern
Wrestling League and the Top Ten
in the national rankings for sure.”

An Eastern Wrestling League
title and position in the Top Ten is a I
very distinct possibility.

But if‘ you think that’s impres-
sive, wait till next season.

“Next year we’ll really be
tough,” Nellis said. “We’ll be able
to compete on a better stage——we’ll
be a lot more mature.”

anxiously.-awaits the tryouts, his
devotion to the Pitt Men’s
swimming team is uppermost.

“We won the‘Penn State Relays
and beat Villanova, which hasn’t
been beaten in 16 meets,”
explained the junior speech and
communications major. “This
could be an indication of what’s to
come. Coach (Dick) Bradshaw has
done an excellent job recruiting,
and (Distance Coach) Fred Lewis
has really helped me personally.
Also, I thi-nk the diving team is the
best in the East.”

Swimming has always been
DeMuro’s,, favorite sport, but he
also enjoys basketball and football
and hopes to play golf this summer.
DeMuro is relaxed, amiable and
unaffected by almost six hours a
day in: a pool, Or the pressure
conveyed by the ﬁerce competition
ahead. . '

  DeMuro Olympic Size  

Moreover, with the sports world
dominated by super-huge athletes,
DeMuro remains a prime example
of someone who has overcome a
size. disadvantage. At 5-8 and 143
pounds, DeMuro has had to work
extra hard to make up for his size.

.“Smallness is a disadvantage,”

said DeMuro, “because swimming
is a matter of leverage. If two
swimmers of equal relative

strength race each other, provided
they have basically the _same

stroke, the larger guy will blow the‘

smaller swimmer out of the water.

You have to make up for it with‘

more speed and endurance. In
swimming, you‘ point for one big

meet and train constantly. Even on I.

the mornings of some dual meets
I'll swim just so I don’t break
training."

But DeMuro has never had any

international swimming experi-
ence, although he hopes to before
the Summer Games in Montreal-——.
if he makes it there. DeMuro was
serious when asked if he thought
he would swim for the Olympic
team. “I don’t think I’m one of the
three best in the country,” he said,
“but it is an honor just to qualify
for the Olympic tryouts. I hope to
make a good showing but I would
be foolish to delude myself.

“It is better to have low goals

than to have high ones and,get ’

disappointed when you don’t win. I
know my limits and how good I am.
I hope to finish high. Who knows?
A miracle might happen.” -
Lacking delusions, DeMuro will
still train_ rigorously in hopes of
making the Olympic squad and
emerging as one of the three best
