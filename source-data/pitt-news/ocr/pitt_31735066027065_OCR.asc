Natural gas promises clear future

By Jackie Duggan
Asst. News Editor

Concerned experts have told us the ozone level
in Southwestern Pennsylvania is exceeding the fed-
eral standards. With attention on the environment,
it is good to know Pitt is making plans that can let

us all breathe a little easier.

Beginning in September, the university will
introduce 20 natural gas vehicles to its Ride Share
Program, said Bob Harkins, Director of Parking

and Transportation.

The natural gas vehicles have been purchased as
part of a three-year study to measure the environ-
mental results of using natural gas versus petrole-

um gas vehicles.

Pitt is using a grant from the Federal Highway
Administration and Pennsylvania Energy Office for
$719,000, which will cover the bulk of the expens-
es to Chrysler, which is manufacturing the vans.

Students
reach for
America

By Sunday
Lewandowski
For The Pitt News

Teach For America is an
organization which helps
students realize their full
potential. Each year, hun-
dreds of outstanding recent
college graduates are select-
ed into Teach For America
to commit two years to teach
in urban and rural public

schools which traditionally '

suffer from teacher short-
ages.

“It’s a support vehicle for
many of these students.
They learn and have fun
while each student grows in
self-respect from all the
activities provided,” said
Rhonda Gainous, who grad-
uated from Pitt in 1993 and
is currently serving her sec-
ond year in Teach For
America.

The members of Teach For
America provide programs
that start after school for
students and parents. They
seek out grants to supple-
ment their school’s recours-
es, participate in their
school’s site-based manage-
ment teams, attend board
meetings, provide leadership
for extra-curricular activities
and involve parents in their
classroom discussions.

“We set up discussion
hours with parents and stu-
dents after school to make
sure the parent is aware of
the student’s progresses,”
said Gainous. “Usually, this
makes-V-“the student more
comfortable when con-
fronting a teacher. After a
while, the student grows

°Teach, page 4

The Equitable Gas Company is expected to pro-
vide approximately $38,000 in additional funds to
purchase the vans, bringing the study total to
around $757,000.

“We are not just getting money for vans,” said
Jim Cobb, Director of the Energy Resource
Program at Pitt’s School of Engneering. ‘‘It is part
of the effort to get the ozone under control. I am
very pleased to see the many issues" this project
touches.” -

Cobb said the NGV program is being launched
in an effort to prepare Pitt and other ﬂeet operators
in Southwestern Pennsylvania for the many gov-
ernmental acts being passed to protect the environ-
ment.

One such law is the Clean Air Act of 1990,
which requires all large ﬂeet operators in highly

populated areas of the United States to have at least
20 percent of their new vehicles powered by light

Preliminary results
of a five-year service
demonstration con-
ducted by the Western
Psychiatric Institute
and Clinic are ‘being
considered for use by
the National Center for
Child Abuse and
Neglect to enhance
treatment.

_Fifty-six physically
abusive families in the
Pittsburgh area were
referred to the Pitt
study, Project IMPACT
(Interventions to
Maximize Parent and
Child Togetherness),
to evaluate the effec-
tiveness of individual
and family treatments.

“There were five
treatment studies, and
ours was one of the

five,” said David
Kolko, director of
WPIC’s Child and

Parent Behavior Clinic
and principal investi-
gator of . Project
IMPACT.

“It was the only one
specifically devoted to
physical abuse,” he
said. “The other four
are sexual abuse.” ~

He said the study
offered an individual

tion in which the
abused child and his or
her parents were treat-

Writing interns are going places

By Nicole Walz
Staff Writer

One intern went on to
do public relations for
the White House. Another
was hired to do public
relations for The Pittsburgh
Public Theater. Former
intern Saul Markowitz is
the director of marketing for
The Pittsburgh Zoo. Others
write for newspapers nation-
wide.

These are just some of the
success stories from the

English department’s writing
internship program.

“When I was an undergrad
at Pitt, I had a [public rela-
tions] internship with the
Gateway Clipper, and from
that I was hired on,” said
Markowitz. “It really helped
me get started.”

The English department
has interns every semester,
working either with news
or public relations for
places like Children’s
Hospital, the American
Civil Liberties Union,

Pittsburgh Dance Council,
television stations KDKA
and WPXI and In Pittsburgh
magazine.

“The writing internships
were established by the pro-
gram 12 or 13 years ago to
get students in entry level or
better positions,” Evelyn
Pierce said. Pierce has been
director of the program for
about six years.

According to Markowitz,

common is an edge over

duty alternative fuel.

Another is the Energy Policy Act of
1992, which is designed to reduce U.S.
dependence on foreign oil.

The public’s use of natural gas is some-
thing the gas companies have been antici-
pating.

“It is part of our broader picture,” said
Jim Pekore, the NGV manager of technol-
ogy development at the Equitable Gas Co.

According to Pekore, the company has
been trying to nurture‘ the natural gas mar-
ket because it represents a new realm for
fuel usage. Pekore likes to say natural gas
use covers the three E’s — economics,
energy security and enviromnent.

“[Natural gas] is cleaner, allows us to
use domestic fuel and it saves money,”
said Pekore.

Because natural gas is a vapor and not a
liquid, it is hard to say exactly how much
Pitt will save, but Steve Shearson, the
NGV program manager at Equitable, esti-
mates the university will save almost 50
cents per gallon in fuel.

A problem with natural gas is its avail-

ability to the public. Pitt and Equitable
Gas are currently working on negotiations
with Exxon to put a natural gas pump at
the Oakland station on the corner of
Forbes Avenue and McKee Place.

Cobb said it is like the chicken and the

public wants it,” he said. “We need to get
as many fill stations as possible open to
the public to get people to convert [to nat-
ural gas].”

According to Cobb, another problem
with NGVs is that they have been

part of the effort to get the ozone under control.

ject touches.”

egg theory.

. “We want cleaner air and less foreign
dependence, but we have to have the
infrastructure to get [natural gas] when the

designed as dual-fuel engines. This means
engines could use petroleum and natural
gas, which created sluggish pick—up and
poor vehicle performance.

Pekore said a great thing about NGVS is
how they compare to petroleum vehicles
in performance.

“The driver does not know the differ-
ence,” said Pekore. ‘‘[With today’s tech-
nology] drivability is the same.”

Cobb said NGVs were made this way
because of the lack of public natural gas
stations. The driver had the option of get-
ting regular gas if he could not ﬁnd natural
gas. -.

The vans the university is buying will
solely use natural gas engines. According
to Chrysler and other manufacturers of
NGVs, this allows for a more finely tuned
vehicle.

“We expect riders to experience .the
equivalent or better performance on the
[Pitt Ride Share] van as they always
have,” said Cobb.

There are around 225 employees of the "

university who use the vans, and they will
be the ﬁrst to determine the quality of the
ride, said Harkins. ‘

But only time will tell, and that is what
Cobb and other researchers will monitor
over the next three years.

environment, making
learning activities easy to
grasp.”

Students who grow up in
under-resourced areas are
at a tremendous education-
al disadvantage. They
might live in communities
where violence is an every-
day reality, where possibil-
ities seem limited and
where extra-curricular
activities are not an option

v for these students.

All of this is only further
complicated by the
fact that society holds low
expectations for these
students. This results in.
student achievement test
rates that are far below
average in national rank-
ings.

These students need
more attention that others.
This is how Teach For
America comes into
perspective. These stu-
dents do indeed benefit
from their own experi-
enced teachers, but most
of the time, it is important
for them to hear from
someone closer to their
own age. Recent college
graduates can serve as
role models and inspire in
them a sense of possibili-
ties.

Since Teach For
America’s inception in
1989, 15,000 college stu-
dents from all academic
majors have competed to
enter the program. About
3,000 of them have been
placed in different geo-

I graphical locations all over

the country.

“I teach now in an ele-
mentary school in Los
Angeles, California. I plan

~ to continue teaching for

several years after I com-
plete this program. It is a
wonderful opportunity,”
said Gainous.

Collectively, corps mem-

bers have helped inﬂuence
the lives of over 500,000
under-served students in
over 500 schools.

Teach For America was
also involved in the shap-
ing of President Clinton’s
national service initiative
beginning in the fall of
1993. _

In June of 1994, Teach
For America was selected
to be part of of the
AmeriCorps National
Service Network and to
field close to 1,000 of the
20,000 charter AmeriCorps
members.

The average SAT score

of a corps member is_

around 1190, and the aver-
age age is 23 years old.
Each summer, Teach
For‘ America brings
together its 500 new
recruits for an intensive
summer training camp.
The institute aims to
give these new recruits
the skill, knowledge

and habits theyneed to

enter the classroom as
teachers to provide the stu-
dents with the support they
need;

Many corps members
decide to stay in the
profession of teaching
beyond their two-year
commitment, while some
choose to move on to other
fields. Many are also out-
spoken’ advocates for
excellence and equity in
education. _

“Being part of Teach For
America is a’ big advantage

in the education field. My V

main advantage was that it
allowed me to start my
career earlier than most
people,” said Gainous.
Each year, principals and
superintendents ask Teach
For America to place corps
members in their schools.
“It’s a wonderful pro-
gram and a wonderful way
to start a career,” said
Gainous. '

this treatment focused on teaching them
communication, competency and self-con-
trol skills.

“That was contrasted with a condition
where they received one treatment which
was family therapy,” he said.

He said they found the individual treat-
ment to be associated with a more rapid
reduction in the use of physical force by the
parent during the treatment. He said this
could be due to the fact that in individual
treatment, the child is more open about
abuse because his or her parents are not pre-
sent, and also because the children get more
of a chance to speak when their parents are
not there to interrupt.

“Our motivation was to help teach them
alternatives to physical discipline,” he said.

He said every week the parents and chil-
dren were asked to fill out a form asking if
they used or were exposed to physical abuse
during the week. He said this way the par-
ents are less prone to lie if they know the
children will be asked as well.

“One of the main thrusts for the project
was to include kids as research informants,”
he said. '

He said the average age of the children in
the study was 6-13.

Based on an annual survey of child we]-
fare officials in the United States, over 1
million children were confirmed as victims
of maltreatment in 1993, and almost 3 mil-
lion were reported as suspected victims of
abuse or neglect, according to the Chicago-
based National_ Committee to Prevent Child
Abuse.

Also, for the third straight year, over
1,100 children were identified as fatal vic-
tims of maltreatment. The survey found that
86 percent of these victims were under the
age of five, and 46 percent were under the
age of one at the time of their death.

Kolko said he will determine if the out-
come of the individual treatment was suc-

cessful by following up on each family for

up to one year after treatment has ended.

He said the funding was provided by the
National Center for Child Abuse and
Neglect, and the findings may be sent to
Congress and the Department of Health and
Human Services.

He said the center serves as the federal
liaison for the purpose of communicating
when certaintrends in treatment have been
found.

their competition. Internshi_ps are the way
to get experience while still in school.

“The job market is very competitive. An
employer looks for someone who has
experience over someone who doesn’t,”
said Pierce.

The writing internships are open to peo-
ple in any major interested in writing
experience. All that is required are two
courses, “Introduction to Journalism” and
“Newspaper I,” along with two published
clips. 

While doing an in‘ter’nsliip, students
receive three credits for the internship
course. For English Writing majors con-
centrating in magazine or newspaper writ-
ing, the internship is a requirement for
graduation. '

Some of the internships pay anywhere
from $5-10 an hour, but most are non-paid.
The time commitment is approximately
10-15 hours a week, and at least half of the
work entailed must be writing.

“I’m getting experience I can’t get in
school  [like] research, press releases
and media relations,” said senior Jennifer
Wolfe, an intern at Burson-Marsteller, a
Pittsburgh public relations and advertising
firm. _

“Not only will they have [business] con-
tacts, they will have a portfolio, too,” said
Markowitz. Those portfolios will be good
to show future employers. 1

Pierce said that employers sometimes
give preference to former interns before
anyone else. Even if the company that stu-
dents intern with does not hire them,
Pierce estimates that 60 percent of her past
interns have found their internship experi-
ence helpful in finding a job. She averages
50-60 interns in the spring and summer
semesters and 25-30 in the fall.

Markowitz hires Pitt interns every
semester and “treats them as well as my
supervisor treated me.” ‘

“I have them do as much as I do  I can
leave the office and feel comfortable they
are taking over while I’m gone,” he said.
“My interns are an integral part of what I
doand what the department does.”

Pierce and her intern, Craig Frand,
work to find internships that appeal to
students, and they boast a 99 percent
placement rate. Students interested in an
internship can find out more information
by stopping by their Cathedral of Learning
sixth floor office or via the Internet
(interns@pitt.edu).

Ruling for freedom

The Supreme Court recently ruled that the South Boston
Allied War Veterans Council does not have to include a gay-
rights group in its annual Saint Patrick’s Day parade. Justice
David Souter wrote the decision that determined the private

organization which sponsors the parade does not have to allow .

a gay-rights activist organization to march in their parade.
For the past year the issue has been debated over whether or
not the parade’s sponsors have the right to keep the gay-rights

. group from marching in the St. Paddy’s Day parade. Now that

the Supreme Court has determined the parade may be selec-
tive in choosing participants, the question ‘arises whether or
not the gay-rights organization is being abridged of its free-
doms.

This issue revolves around the fact of who may exclude
whom, and when. The Supreme Court was asked to determine
whether or not a private group had the right to exclude a group
from its own function. The Court determined that because the
sponsor of the parade was a private group and not a govern-
ment—funded entity, the Veteran’s Council had the right to
exclude anyone from marching in the parade. This includes
the gay-rights activists. ,

We support the decision by the Supreme Court. Basically, in

I this case, they are reestablishing a freedom that should already

be crystal clear. It’s a private group sponsoring the parade,
therefore they can keep in or out whomever they choose.

Get rid of party politics

Members of the Allegheny County Democratic Party will be
coming to Pitt this Saturday for a seminar on how to better
reach the public with their message.

Maybe their democratic comrades in the Pennsylvania State
Senate could join them, because it looks like they need a
refresher course on why you hold public office. Last week the

- Dems continued a trend that, unfortunately, seems to be grow-

ing rather rapidly. And every time it happens, guess who gets
screwed?

Yup, the voters.

The Democrats played party politics and it will cost Pitt
$269 million in grants. The Democrats were bitter and angry
because they were kept out of the loop in Gov. Ridge’s new
budget proposal, so they stacked the votes in a resentful ges-
ture towards the senate Republicans. The result was a vote that
fell five short of giving a considerable amount of money to
Pitt, as well as other schools in Pennsylvania.

The Dems might have a legitimate beef in getting steam-
rolled out of Ridge’s budget plans, but that is no excuse. The
Democrats might be the winners but the Republicans aren’t
the losers. The real loser anytime the game of partisan politics
is played is you —— the voter, the taxpayer and the student.

The Pitt News

An end to the status quo

e history of all human
society, past and present,
has been the history of

class struggle.

“Freeman and slave, patrician
and plebeian, baron and surf,
guild—burgess and joumeymen
———- in a word the oppressor and
the oppressed —— stood each to
the other. They carried on per-
petual warfare, sometimes
masked, sometimes open and
acknowledged; warfare that
invariablyrended, either in a
revolutionary change in the
whole structure of society, or
else in the common ruin of the
contending classes.”

That was written by Marx and
Engels more than a century ago,
yet the question begs, has soci-
ety really changed?

We have only to look at the
recent Gulf War, in which a
tyrant sought to impress himself
upon the citizens of a sovereign
state or, more aptly, the struggle
in Yugoslavia where a ven-
omous aggressor seeks to subju-
gate citizens of a democratic
republic to answer that nothing
has changed; this conﬂict will
always exist, whether it be in
foreign lands oron the domestic
front, such as the national gov-
ernment or even closer to home.

Now, fellow students, it is
time to ask yourselves whether
this form of tyranny exists with-
in your very midst, upon this
very campus. Do not we have a
hierarchy within our own stu-
dent government? Can one real-
ly say that a board of nine
should speak for the needs of
nearly 15,000 undergrads? If
this is true, then we have an
exclusive club resulting in the
concentration of power in the
hands of a few, not the many.

Presently neither a legislature
nor true judiciary exist to check
the power of the SGB. Thus, we
have an executive board in mm.
meaning no significant redress
of student grievances can be
made without the approval of
this board. Moreover, should
this boardttdeny a request, no

other venue for student con-

~.

cerns exists. Thus, we have
reached a critical impasse: we
can either continue to accept
this form of tyranny or consign
the SGB to the ash heap of his-
tory.

How can we do this? Simple:
organize. With the advent of a
new chancellor, we have no
time to waste. By forming a
united front against this exclu-

sive club, it will soon collapse,

because SGB can only survive
if it meets our needs, which
would result in its abolition.

What about the committee
system? It, in no way whatsoev-
er, constitutes a student legisla-
ture. First it does not possess
legislative authority; that is
vested unto the board at this
time. Furthermore, the board,
by its own authority and not
that of the people, appoints
these committees and makes
them submissive to their
appointers, not to the will of the
people. ,_

It is evident, therefore, that
we have a democracy in name
but not in practice.

After we organize to such a
formidable presence that the
SGB can no longer ignore us,
we should demand the follow-
ing:

1. An immediate abolition of
the SGB and a Constitutional
Convention directly elected to
write a new Constitution;

2. A more comprehensive Bill
of Student Rights to include
American liberties as well as
the freedom of expression;

3. An elected judiciary to
uphold these liberties, staffed
entirely by students; and

4. To share with the adminis-
tration and faculty decisions in
university policy dealing with
the welfare of the students.

The only way this can be
achieved is through the applica-
tion of an old theory: progres-
sivism. What is progressivism?
It states that the government
must cliangc as the needs of the
people change.

Who is a Progressive?
Anyone who loves liberty.

Progressives can be Democrats,
Republicans, Socialists, etc.;
thus, political affiliation is not
important. By the same token,
religion, race, creed, gender and
sexual orientation are not
important either.

What does a neo—progressive
stand for? A government which
upholds the will of the people,
and one which prohibits the
concentration of power within
any one branch of the govem-

ment as a whole. This is done‘

by a system of checks and bal-
ances as well as the concepts of
recall, referendum and initia-
tive.

Recall is simply the concept

that any decision or person in V

the government may be over-
ruled by the people. Thus, all
members of the government (as
well as its decisions) must be
conducive to'the popular will,
or else the elected officials may
be removed or the decision
negated.

Initiative is the principle that
the people may force the gov-
ernment to act upon a matter
which the people deem neces-
sary. This may be accomplished
by a number of votes or a series
of signatures.

Referendum is the principle
that enables a representative
democracy to become a direct
democracy. The government
may, by its own desires, ask the
people to decide a matter which
they cannot.

Applying the previous theory,
we have conclude the follow-
ing:

1. There must be a new stu-
dent legislature, comprised of
grads and undergrads;

2. A new executive must be
formed;

3. A new judiciary must be
formed; and

4. The neo—progressive princi-
ples of recall, initiative and ref-
erendum must be an integral
part of the constitution.

So students of Pitt, unite for a
better government!

JUNE 21 1995 T

A decade has passed since
critics, social and cinematic,
first slagged Rambo: First
Blood Part II. An ideological
text it surely is; what all these
critics are interested in, and
why they value films like
Rambo, The Green Berets or
'.“.‘.l’.' ’.‘.'«’.'%f8'.' Basket; at B it ‘.8 ways
these texts interact with the
social moment to which they're
bound.

But the focus of this piece
isn’t on any of the films men-
tioned above, it’s about the
new cement think-block that is
An American Hero. The Scott
O’Grady text is no piece of cin-
ema, but it sure feels like
action-film. Media coverage of
the pilot’s rescue in The
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, The
New York Times, Newsweek,
Time and U.S. News and
World Report have all invoked
the myth of the lone brave-
hearted soldier, fighting off the
“heartless” enemy.— that
which is Serbian —-— to beat on
a God and country drum. And
that’s what the media’s for.
Right?

The above-cited media had
one, obvious thing to say
about O’Grady: hero a la
Rambo. To Newsweek this
“American Hero” had “The
Right Stuff,” it was “All for One”
at Time, while the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette threw the three-
inch headline “l’m OK. Get Me

Out” at us. Obviously, the syn-
tax of mainstream media cov-
erage has the intention of fos-
tering an attachment to the
story, and to our good ol’
American boy who spent “Six
Days Behind Enemy Lines”
(Newsweek cover, June 19th).
Other headlines read: “Rescue
Behind Enemy Lines,” “l’m
ready to get the hell out of
here,” and umpteen others that
smack of the masculinized,
Reagan-era war film. '

Taking the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazzette’s coverage of
O’Grady’s rescue, assistant
managing editor Chris Pett-
Ridge said the media did get
very excited about the rescue.
Pett-Ridge said he laid out the
June 9th paper, the first day of

the O’Grady stories. With a _

headline that smacks of a
police scanner-ish quote, ‘‘I’m
OK. Get Me Out,” and a photo
taken off of a television screen,
the Post-Gazette adopted a
verite “having-been-there” tone
to tell the O’Grady story. Now,
it’s bullshit to assume there’s a
mass-media conspiracy intent-
ed to sway the American pub-
lic against the Serbs. But
what’s working in the other
direction is the assumption that
mainstream news is objective
and “just the facts” —— which
the above-cited media convey
with conventions of realism (ie,
the date heading each page,
the photos, the demarcation of
news-opinion from news-fact
that the editorial page sug-
gests and the this—is-what-hap-
pened authorial voice for arti-
cles).

Yet at the same time the
print cues readers to accept
the text as an objective piece,
they throw ideologically
loaded-phrases like “American
Hero” at us. These hero con-
notations “draw Americans fur-
ther into Bosnia in a sensation-
al and not educational way.
And it’s drawing lines,” said
Steven Rendall, senior analyst
for FAIR (Fairness and
Accuracy in Reporting). Which
is especially scary given the
Bosnian context and interna-
tional climate generating this
latest Rambo narrative. Pett-
Ridge offered this explanation
for the Post-Gazette’s play on
the O’Grady story: “There's no
point pretending that if this
were a different country we'd
play the story the same way.

No. Obviously, we have more
feelings for our own people 
You can look back at the Gulf
War, WWll, whatever. You’re
never going to separate the
media from some kinds of feel-
ings of patriotism.”

But FAlR’s Rendall said the
media’s spin goes beyond sim-
ply writing from an American
point of view. “The overheated
coverage gives aid and com-
fort to those policy elites who
would have the US become
more involved on the side of
the Bosnian Muslims. It does
that by drawing the lines

between friends
and enemies,”
he said. For

Rendall said,

know he’s an American Hero
— they’re not discussing any
of the specifics that could tell
us why he’s such a hero.

That there is .a story about
an American who survived
under unquestionably difficult
conditions isn’t the issue. What
is the issue is the way the fall-
out from the O’Grady coverage
may misinform our under-
standing of the Bosnian crisis.
Within the last month Bosnian
Serbs have taken hostage

Nations soldiers, annulled

agreements with the UN.and
virtually declared war on the
UN. United Nations forces
have bombed Serbian arma-
ments and po|icy—makers are
debating whether they have, or
if they should, cross the
“Mogadishu line” —— that is,
abandon the UN purpose as
peacekeepers and become
combatants. Clinton recently
changed the conditions for
committing troops to the region
and has offered 25,000 to
evacuate UN peacekeepers
should the need arise. But with
terms like “allies” and “ene-
mies” splattering today’s head-
lines, it’s clear the media is
poised to inform the public with
less fairness and more
wartime jingoism and reductive
black hat/white hat phraseo|o-
gy. As the situation in Bosnia
goes from bad to worse, with
escalation to a multi-interna-
tional level virtually inevitable,
the American press is busy
reducing the story to a two-
dimensional “Right Stuff” level.
Time’s cover on June 19th
has been probably the most
telling of all examples of a jin-
goistica|ly—infused media with a
not-so-hidden agenda. At the
time the issue went to print,
Bosnian Serbs were still hold-
ing many UN soldiers hostage.
Accompanying the pathos-
laden photo of a teary-eyed
O’Grady, in uniform, was the
print, “A Pi|ot’s Story... In a

The Underneath
Directed by
Soderbergh

With Peter Gallagher, Alison
Elliot and William Fichtner

Steven

They’|l call Steven
Soderburgh’s thin thriller, The
Underneath, another update of
film noir, but after seeing it you
might want to amend that to
film bleu, mostly because
Soderburgh finds his fetish for
filming through blue filters as a
way to recreate the murky
darkness of classic noirs.

That same post-war para-
noia of films like The Asphalt
Jungle and The Killers gets run
through the gauntlet of human
failings. Peter Gallagher is an
ex-compulsive gambler who
comes back to the town,
woman and family he bailed
out on when his debts got out
of hand. He comes back to find
his honey (Alison Elliot) in the
arms of a psycho night club
owner, while his big brother,
the shady cop, keeps letting
him know his renewed pres-
ence is Iess than welcome.

Soderbergh mines the usual
flashback sequences to replay
the noir theme of a past which
refuses to allow its characters
to escape damnation for their
original sin.

These little snipets from the
hero’s memory also give the
film a chance to show off the
nubile bod of Gallagher’s old
flame, Ms. Elliot, who’s now
playing with our hero just as
everybody else seems to be in
some unnamed game of
intrigue. But the relationship
between these two is less
steamy and more stupid than
anything. Why did she hang
with this guy who obviously
cared more about the football
game he watching because he
has money on it than fucking
her? Is it the quick money she
finds intoxicating? We don’t
know because we see so little
depth in these flashbacks.
They say little about why he
gambles and even less about
why he wants her back.

Now to a lowbrow fool like
me, the labyrinth here is thank-
fully un-chesslike, but that’s
also the trouble with The
Underneath. Despite all the
noir trimmings (Dutch angles,
characters framed tightly in
claustrophobic interior spaces,
etc.) the plot never quite boils.
Sure this filmic world is popu-
lated by a host of semi-seedy
types and few innocents. But
the particular lusts of the indi-
viduals seem obscured by

Tooth Imprints on a Corn

Harmony Books —— $19.00

Throwing away such dated
literary concepts as “plot” and
‘characters/’ Mark Leyner’s
irst three books, somnabu|a—
ory infomercials illustrating
he white noise that is
Leyner’s mind, provided the
reading public with a recre-

tional drunk driving spree

long the information super-
highway. In My Cousin, My
Gastroenterologist and Et Tu,
Babe, the author created an
vant—pop approach to writing,
refashioning both himself and
his world into a Valhalla of
opular culture and technolo-

y. Whereas My Cousin was a
ormidable blitzkrieg of poetic
prose and hyberbolic bravado,

nd Et Tu faltered with its
minor attempt at a consecu-
ive storyline and “characters,”
Tooth Imprints on a Corn Dog
inds strength in its stylistic
looseness and its satirical

hannel-surfing view of
merican culture.

Leyner describes his own

riting in comparison to Keith
Richards’ guitar solo on the
Rolling Stones classic,
‘Sympathy for the Devil:”

 

“Sharp, shiny, incredible,
nasty, violent bursts of raw
sounds. There’s no leading up
to it, it’s just suddenly there,
like rain or razors.”

It is this Einsterzende
Neubauten loves Hunter
Thompson approach to prosa-
ic cultural criticism which
Leyner applies to such
diverse, and vital, topics as
bodybuilding, fatherhood and
playwriting.

The main body of work
restrained within the literary
electric fence of Tooth
Imprints on a'Corn Dog is
Leyner’s dramatic reworking
of the Nathaniel Hawthorne
classic, “Young Goodman

Brown.” Leyner’s play, “Young

Bergdorf Goodman Brown,” is
the tale of one Mark Leyner,
trapped for an unknown length
of time inside Bergdorf
Goodman, a department store
in Manhattan, trying to pur-
chase a $3,000 handbag for
his daughter’s Barbie doll. The
play is a rhetorical farce, an
assault on the senses which
disregards the readers’ long-
ing for a semblance of cohe-
sive chronology. As in all his
writings, “YBGB” draws on the
modern necessity-ot-;immedi-
ate impact; Leyner realizes
that in writing, as in advertis-
ing, the audience’s attention

   

span is detectableuonly with
the most sensitive of Geiger
counters, and thus the reader
must be sucked in at every
moment, before the next byte
appears on MTV.

Tooth Imprints is at its best
when the author is using his
patented sci-fl cockiness and
techno-biological extremism to
examine the world around
him, that of accelerated pop-
culture. He has said that,
while some writers have tradi-
tionally turned to nature for
inspiration, “Sensory overload
is my environment.” It is from
this constant melee with tele-
vision, computers and the
entire culture of instant infor-
mation that Leyner draws his
inspiration.

The title piece of the book
refers to his 30-hour rampage
of composition which pro-
duced a 1,000 line free-verse
poem for the German maga-
zine Der Gummiknuppel, the
“German equivalent of Martha
Stewart Living, but with more
nudity and grisly crime.” Given
the orders to write the verse in
the “poete maudit tradition of
Rimbaud, but infused with the
ebullience and joie de vivre
that made ABBA so popular in
the ‘70s”, Leyner flew to an
L.A. hotel to hole up and write.
In “The Making of Tooth

  

Imprints on a C0r_rLDog,“ the
author shows us an hour-by-
hour breakdown of his stay in
the hotel, and thoughts on all
the food, drink and sensory
overload which an undertaking:
of this caliber required.
To compare Mark Leyner to
humor columnist Dave Barry
would be astoundingly inco-
herent, culturally anachronis-
tic, stylistically absurd and
completely valid and correct,
thus I will not do so. In an
information age, in the William
Gibson reality of 1995, Leyner
is the one modern writer who
captures the energies (waste
not, want more) and the faults
of modern life in a fresh, invig-
orating and literarily frighten-
ing manner. He gargles withl
Johnnie Walker black, he
practices “Extreme Sports,”
such as rock climbing andl
drag racing, with his six-
month—o|d daughter (to whom:
he reads Rimbaud), and he
has a perfect plan to revamp
the Miss America pageant to
include contests such as
championship chess andl.
marksmanship.
Leyner has begun adding:
“content” to his writing “style,”
but without adding enemies
like the restraining “story.” In
this way, he has disposed o
the tired format of “non”-fiction
prose, like Barry’s, while
retaining all its biting power.
He has created wha
American fiction needs, and
wants, so desperately: a book
from which any paragraph can
be-taken randomly and used
as a decent answering
machine message. “

Soderbergh’s desire to imitate
the look and feel of
Gallagher’s paranoia through
cinematography, and not char-
acter. Most of the folks in this
film often seem incidental cari-
catures that are less than
compelling.

When plotting, then hatching
a heist, a betrayal and murder,
you’d think‘ a film would need
some good sharp characters
with well-drawn relationships
to make all that believable.
Well, tell that to Soderbergh,

who’s overdone the look and
underdone the story. Maybe
he needs go to back to the
kitchen where he cooked up
Sex, Lies and Videotape to
find the right filmic recipe.

‘Tis Pity She’s A Whore
Directed by David Pellegrini

Click Click Click  A
metronome echoes through The Pit
where The Unseam'd Shakespeare
Company is rehearsing ‘Tis Pity She’s
A Whore, which opens this Friday at
Luciano’s. It’s coming up on 95
degrees outside, and it can’t be easy
for these actors in their Chuck Taylors
and denim to concentrate on transform-
ing John Ford's 1633 free verse into a
Ginsburg-like, beat dialogue.

The story, reset in an early ‘60s Little
Italy, centers on Anabella, who, name-
calling aside, is not so much a whore
as a woman cursed by the demon of
love. She’s fallen for a terrific guy, but
as fate would have it, he’s her brother.
They get relatively too close, and when
she becomes pregnant She’s forced to
marry one of her suitors to legitimize
their child. The rest of this
tragedy/black comedy is spliced with
subplots of revenge, honor and sense-
less, needless death.

Director David Pellegrini chose the
‘60s to frame the production because
of what he felt was a very real correla-
tion between that time of social
upheaval and civil strife and the histori-
cal period in which the play was writ-
ten. He stresses the feeling of rebel-
liousness against societal norms.

Performing this rarely seen classical
tragedy in the ‘burgh, the Unseam’d
Shakespeare Company will be break-
ing a few norms of their own. “We’re
stripping it down to base elements,”
Pellegrini said, explaining his decision
to cut three acts (THREE ACTS!)-and

25 percent of the text. lt’s being per-
formed on a coffeehouse stage as
opposed to following the more formal-
ized restrictions of a theater. And on
the corner stairs of this tight black prac-
tice stage, quietly sits the violinist (a
wanna-be rock star/psychiatrist/lawyer)
whO’s been hired to stroll through the
audience during the performances.

The cast made up of Pitt actors, fac-
ulty and staff is attempting to bring the
director’s self-proclaimed cinematic
approach to life. “So many of the
images we get (of Italian-American
iconography) are from movies. I'm try-
ing to get on the inside of it,” he said.
“This play pokes fun at the stereotypes.
The image of these characters as pas-
sionate and intelligent gives way.”

Set 330 years after the original and
pre-Godfather, this work performed in
the ‘90s can't help but be influenced
strongly by both. The challenge for
these actors doesn’t lie in Iegitimizing
Anabe|la’s child to the audience
through a love story. As if anyone could
play off an upbeat angle involving
incest. More challenging is their fueling
this contemporary, unique interpreta-
tion with humor and insight into the
characters. ’

An actress crashes to the ground,

and while for a second I thought it ,

might have been the heat, she jumps
back up, reincarnated, only to practice
the same death sequence at least five
more times in the next 10 minutes. She
has to collapse on just the right count.
Following the premise that synchro-
nization is everything, this production of
‘Tis Pity She’s A Whore promises to
successfully incorporate a faster
paced, attention grabbing, contempo-
rary staging with a classical tljeme.

the two situations then become depen-
dent upon one another. The idea is if
we can ‘rescue one from the demonic
clutches of the Serbs, why not them
all? l discussed the Time cover with
Pett-Ridge and told him I thought the
Post-Gazette's coverage looks the
same as Time’s. i asked him what he
made of the line, ‘‘If only we could res-
cue all the rest.”

“You mean like we're taking sides, Or
something?" he asked.

“Yes, exactly,” l said.

“Sure. What’s wrong with that? lt’s
clear that any publication in this coun-
try is going to have a point of view, and
that point of view is going to be the
American point of view,” Pett-Ridge

said.

John G. Craig, editor of the Post-
Gazette, said the paper is not taking
sides in the Bosnian conflict. “There’S
nothing especially American about it 
lt’s just a story about somebody being
rescued. Anybody reading into this is
just grabbing straws,” Craig said.

If you’ve read into it this far, you
probably know that ain’t so. “With few
other stories to humanize the war, the
coverage is definitely all out of propor-
tion with the greater political concerns
of the last five years,” Rendall said. ‘‘It
shows little concern for the complicated
history and political issues in Bosnia.
What should have been done is a
broader and deeper investigation of the
roots of the conflict.’’

J oe things to
Wright watch for over

the course of
the fortnight:

°The favorites in -this
year’s tournament are two-
time defending champion
and No. 2—seeded Pete
Sampras (10-11 odds) and
top-seeded Steffi Graf (1-
2). Top-seeded Andre
Agassi (5-1), the 1992 win-
ner, and defending
women’s champ No. 3-
seeded Conchita Martinez
(4-1) are also considered
top threats to win their sec-
ond titles each. Third seed
Boris Becker on the men’s
side and Arantxa Sanchez-
Vicario, Jana Novotna and
Mary Pierce (seeded sec-
ond, fourth and fifth
respectively) are the only
other players expected to
seriously contend forthe
title.

-Graf (‘88-’89, ‘91-’93)
and Martinez are the only
former champions in the
women’s draw. Agassi,
Becker (‘85-’86, ‘89),
Sampras, Michael Stich
(‘91), Stefan Edberg (‘88,
‘90) and Pat Cash (‘87) are
the former men’s winners
playing this year. Edberg’s
career has been waning
over the last 12 months,
which is reflected by his
No. 13 seed, his lowest in
over a decade. He and Cash
will meet in the second
round, barring upsets.

. -The most intriguing
first—round matchups both
involve multiple title hold-
ers versus young up-and-
comers. Graf has drawn 14-
year—old sensation Martina
Hingis, last year’s junior
champion, as her opponent.

On the men’s side,
Becker must begin his
quest for a fourth title
against the No. 12 player in
the world, Alberto
Berasategui, who is
unseeded due to inexperi-
ence on grass courts. The
young Spaniard is_a clay-
court dynamo with sizzling
groundstrokes, but the
lawns of the All England
Club will create even more
gmis-hits than usual from
his unique forehand.
Becker should win con-
vincingly, but not easily.

Percentages are on Jackson's side

Pitt basebal  
coach '5 ”sys fem ”
sends program
into national
limelight

By Sean Duncan
Managing Editor

Sporadic boxes‘ and books clutter the cor-
ners of Mark Jackson’s pint-size office.
Nothing seems to be in place, except for two
monumental silver trophy cups that stand
like mini-skyscrapers on a cabinet behind
his desk.

Having already pointed out that his office
needs a makeover, Jackson gestures toward
the trophies.

“I like them there,” he said. “I think they
look pretty neat. When I take recruits here,
they can see what we’ve done.”

The one on the left is the 1994 Big East
baseball regular season championship tro-
phy, which Jackson says he needs to polish.
Perched next to it is Jackson’s newest baby,
the 1995 Big East tournament championship
cup.

Not only are the trophies a first for Pitt
baseball, they’re symbolic to where the five-
year head coach is taking the Panther pro-

gram.  V

Since coming to Pitt from Point Par
College, Jackson has led his team to three
straight 30-win seasons — each year break-
ing the win record from the year before. In
1993 Pitt posted its first 30-win season.
Then in ‘94 the Panthers won 31 games, and
this season Jackson and company stapled a
39-16 record which sailed Pitt into the colle-
giate spotlight. Pitt was rated the 28th best
team in the nation by Collegiate Baseball
and 30th by USA Today.

“When I came here I wanted to be in a
position to contend for the Big East champi-
onship every year,” he said. “To try to get

the program into the national spotlight; to be
nationally ranked. It’s great to be recognized
with all those great teams.”

National recognition was a pretty hefty
goal considering Pitt emerged from virtual
obscurity in a field of 261 Division I pro-
grams.

“That’s somewhere in the top 10 percent
in the country,” Jackson said.

Like usual, Jackson’s percentage estimate
is right on. As it should be, considering most
of his much talked about “system” revolves
around it.

“I’m heavily into percentages,” the 39-
year-old Philadelphia native said. “If you go
to Atlantic City and try to win money, you
might win once, but chances are you’re
going to lose in the long haul. Why are you

going to lose? Because the odds are with
them.

“That’s what we try to do with our system
— we try to get the odds with us.”

Talk to any Pitt player or anyone affiliated
with the team and they’ll almost always
allude to “the system.”

“The system is a big part of his winning,”
pitcher Kevin Kramer said. “From day one
he stressed the system.”

“It’s a system based on offensive and
defensive percentages,” Jackson said.
“What’s going to work the majority of the
time, that’s what we try to do.”

Jackson’s system centers around the big
inning. “Usually the big inning wins the
game 75 percent of the time.” The big

would have liked to have won

The 1994-95 NBA season
recently came to an end as
millions watched the Houston
Rockets, led by Hakeem
Olajuwon, defend their cham-
pionship with a four-game
sweep of the young Orlando
Magic. . 

The Rockets followed a pat-
tern that has proven to be

popular in the NBA — they ‘

are the fourth team in a row
to win at least two consecu-
tive titles. The Lakers did it in
1987 and 1988, the Pistons in
1989 and 1990 and the Bulls
took home three in a row
from 1991-93.

The end of the NBA Finals
is often a signal for many to
unlace the Nikes and hit the
links, but this off-season
promises to be one of the
most interesting in recent
memory.

labor negotiations, the filling
of numerous coaching vacan-
cies and also what many pre-
dict to be the best draft since
1984 when some players you
may know entered the league.
There was Michael Jordan,
Charles Barkley and the then
Akeem Olajuwon, just to
name a few.

But, even before these
events unfold, the biggest
Canadian exports since Alan
Thicke and Bob and Doug
McKenzie will hit American
soil in the form of two new
NBA teams.

When November rolls
around and the Rockets begin
their quest to three-peat, the
Toronto Raptors and the
Vancouver Grizzlies will be
the newest clubs with their
eyes on the throne.

The last time the NBA

rolled -out the red carpet to’

expansion teams was in 1989

Timberwolves and the Magic
made their debut. Only one
year before that, the Miami
Heat and Charlotte Hornets
paid their dues.

With the exception of the
Timberwolves, who consis-
tently draft and trade their
way to the cellar, each of
these new teams has matured
into a playoff contender.

It will take time for the
Raptors and Grizzlies to make
a name for themselves on the
court, but the journey to
hoops Mecca begins this
Saturday, June 24, at the
expansion draft in Secaucus,
N.J.

A coin flip won by
Vancouver gives them the 6th
overall pick in the colle-
giate/Kevin Garnett draft,
while the Raptors select 7th
on June 28th . -

Raptors Vice President Dan
Durso wasn’t worried about

the toss, but it’s not terrible.”

It is definitely not terrible
for Toronto because, having
lost the toss, they will have
the first pick in the expansion
draft.

To help the ﬂedgling teams
stock up, each of the 27 exist-
ing teams is required to leave
four players unprotected and
available for Saturday’s selec-
tions. To prevent an existing
team from falling apart, the
rules state that each team may
only lose one of the four play-
ers it leaves unprotected.

“The dispersal draft gives
you the opportunity to select
from a pretty good group of
pros who have been around
the league  some guys who
may have some value and
some you may want to play

tion of your franchise for a

inning is an inning that scores three or
more runs. Also, he has his hitters take a
lot of pitches to wear down the opposing
pitcher and he likes to run, run and run
some more.

“Baseball is a traditional game and a
lot of people like to play straight base-
ball,” he said. “They don’t believe in the
running game, which everybody should
because it’s a high percentage of the
game.”

His running philosophy has paid divi-
dends exponentially. While Pitt was rack-
ing up 30-win seasons in ‘93 and ‘94, the

Panthers led the nation in steals. This

year Pitt was in the top 10. ii

Jackson’s running style is no gimmick,
though. It has proven year in and year out
to be effective. Before coming to Pitt, he
coached seven years at Point Park
College where he tabbed a 291-53
record, a winning percentage of .846. His
teams in ‘89 and ‘90 landed the best
records in the nation at 40-5 and 49-5,
respectively. Also in ‘90, his team broke
its own national collegiate win streak
record with 41 straight victories. With
431 collegiate wins, Jackson was named
the District 18 Coach of the Year for six
consecutive years.

When Jackson left Point Park College
in ‘91, it only took him four years to be
recognized as a coaching heavyweight in
the Big East. In ‘94, when Pitt captured
its first-ever regular season champi-
onship, Jackson was named the Big East
Coach of the Year.

“Basically it’s a curse,” he said,
“because everyone who wins is the team
that won the regular season.” And no
team that has won the regular season has

  
     
       
   
   
       
     
 

 

ever won the Big East tournament.

“I don’t think any coach in the Big
East studies the game as much as he
does,” Kramer said. “He puts so much
into it. Winning the Big East got him the
respect he deserves.”

But Jackson shies away from credit, as
he continuously says he would have none
of this without his assistants Jeff Minick,
Brad Reese, team psychologist Tim
Brundrett and, of course, his players.

But those people weren’t there when
he was a student-athlete at Penn State.
He played one season there, but realized
that he had no future as a baseball player.
But he still wanted to be involved. So he
went to the local high school, State

" College High School, and asked head

coach Ken Bardo if he could help out. So
Bardo assigned him to the junior varsity
team. For the next two years he helped
out on the varsity level.

That’s'when Jackson began his win-.
ning touch. In 1979, State College won
the Pennsylvania State Championship.

‘‘I really liked the analytical part of the
game,” he said. “I got involved because I
lo\’3'E'”baseball.”

It’s proven that Jackson is a winner.
But his greatest accomplishment isn’t
gauged by the win—loss column.

“I don’t have any kids, but I would
imagine it’s very similar watching your
kid grow and mature,” he said. “Just see-
ing your players grow all-around as peo-
ple. That’s the greatest accomplishment
and always will be.”

Another accomplishment Jackson rel-
ishes is his team’s storybook season this
year. Pitt started the year hot, but suffered
a tumultuous mid—season drought only to
make a furious run at the end to barely
squeak into the Big East playoffs on the

last game of the season. From there, the
Panthers used that momentum to win the
Big East tournament. I

Then Pitt found itself in another new
situation — in the mideast regionals

against some of the best competition in
the nation. Pitt dropped its first game to
the long-time national powerhouse

Oklahoma State, 6-3. The Panthers’ .

picked themselves up and notched back-
to-back wins, setting up another con-
frontation with Oklahoma State. Pitt
made a late run at the Cowboys but lost
15-13.

Conceivably, Pitt came three games
from the College World Series. Not bad
considering Jackson lost his whole start-
ing infield coming into the season.

“It was a great season,” Jackson said.
“Realistically, we shouldn’t have even
got that far. We won against probably the
best field the Big East has ever had.

“We weren’t in awe of them
(Oklahoma State), we were just really
happy to be there. It was a nice stadium,
and we were playing Oklahoma State. I
didn’t know what to expect.”

A lone poster on Jackson’s almost-bar-
ren office walls is enough reminder and
incentive of where he wants to go — the
College World Series. While Jackson’s

coaching style is a melting pot of several .

CWS’ veteran coaching philosophies like
Louisiana State and Oklahoma State,
there’s a glaring difference in his style.

Jackson coaches third base and calls
every single pitch of the game. That’s
opposed to the somewhat laid-back
demeanor of a lot of coaches that are
seen in the dugout at all times.

“I’m definitely a hands-on coach in
game situations,” he said. “I really take a
lot of control in games. I think I have a
good idea of the percentages and the
ﬂow of the game.”

Jackson’s hands-on approach is a

match that could produce an upset is eighth-
seeded Sergei Bruguera, another Spaniard
clay-court specialist, vs. veteran doubles
specialist Anders Jarryd. (In fact, any “dou-
bles specialist” is dangerous on grass.)
Twelfth-seeded Richard Krajicek faces a
tough first-round match against American
-Bryan Shelton, a quarterfinalist last year.
Seventh-seeded Lindsey Davenport must
start against Gigi Fernandez (“doubles spe-
cialist”), who was a semifinalist a year ago.

Other unseeded women to watch include
Zina Garrison—Jackson (a finalist in ‘90),
Lori McNeil (who knocked off Graf in last
year’s first round), Israel’s Anna
Smashnova (what a name!) and Patty
Fendick.

°The hosting limeys always manage an
upset or two, and the most likely candidates
on the men’s side are Jeremy Bates, who
has done it before; Mark Petchey, England’s
top Davis Cupper; and Greg Rusedski, an
import from Canada who is the world’s
fastest server. Jo Durie could provide some
excitement for the Brits on the ladies’ side.

‘Top names missing from the field are
French Open champ Thomas Muster, a
noted grassophobe, and 11th—ranked man
Magnus Larsson and ninth-ranked woman
Magdalena Maleeva, both of whom are
injured. , ‘

°Martina Navratilova has retired from
tour—level singles, but she and Graf, playing
together for the first time, are the No. 3-
seeded women’s doubles team in the draw.
Between them, they won every women’s

I singles title from ‘82-’93. This pairing

should take the crown, with only doubles
supertéam Fernandez and Natasha Zvereva
having a real shot at knocking them off.

Toronto V.P. of Basketball
Operations Isiah Thomas.

Although the NBA does not
release an official list of the
players left unprotected, there
are many names that have
been announced by their
respective teams. These
include Dominique Wilkins
of Boston, Byron Scott and
Haywoode Workman of
Indiana and former Duke star
Danny Ferry from the
Cleveland Cavaliers.

The most notable, however,
is Chicago Bulls guard B.J.
Armstrong.

Armstrong, a six-year vet-
eran who played an important
role in the the Bulls’ three-
year reign atop the NBA, has

_ quietly complained about his

taking a backseat to sharp-
shooting Steve Kerr recently.
Armstrong is a solid first pick
for the Raptors, considering
the Hornets selected Kelly
Tripuka first in the 1988
expansion draft.

In Vancouver, former New

of Wisconsin coach Stu
Jackson will lead the way,
this time from the front office
rather than the sidelines.
Coaching duties will go to
former Atlanta Hawks assis-
tant coach Brian Winters.

Since winning the coin
toss, the Grizzlies have set
their sights on the June 28th

draft, where they will sink
their teeth into their first lot-
tery prize.

“We have seen great candi-
dates for our team from col-
leges around the states,” said
Grizzly CEO Michael
Korenberg. “I think our city
knows them better than the
veteran players.” ‘

These two new teams will
hopefully study past drafts on
both the expansion and colle-
giate levels in order to maxi-
mize their opportunities.

On the collegiate level,
futures can be made or lost at

. the sixth and seventh picks.

In 1987, Kenny Smith and
Kevin Johnson went at six
and seven respectively, but
has anyone heard from
William Bedford (#6 in 1987)
or George McCloud (#7 in
1989) lately?

The Raptors and Grizzlies
have been blessed with a
solid crop of NBA veterans
and college prospects to
choose from. With the likes
of Ed O’Bannon, Corliss
Williamson and prep—star
Garnett ﬂoating around, the
future looks promising for
our neighbors to the north.

They will experience their
share of “Growing Pains”
along the way, and only time
will tell how successful they
will actually be in the NBA.

It’s amazing how far $125
million will go these days,
eh!

Jackson

°From page 11

reﬂection of his burning intensity. But seeing him
in a game situation, he looks very quiet, bordering
on disinterested.

“Sometimes it’s hard to see yourself through
your own eyes in a game, but I’m really involved
in the game,” he said. “Really intense. I just try to
stay really focused. You have to be calm to make
decisions. You got to remain calm because you
want the players to remain ‘calm. When you
coach, you don’t want to be a fan, you want to be
making decisions based on percentages.

“That’s my personality, really. It’s mainly
because I’m trying to think a lot about what to do.
I think if you’re quiet, it means you’re listening.
When you get emotionally involved in a game,
you don’t make good decisions. I try to stay emo-
tionally calm.”

“He doesn’t have that much to say,” Kramer
said. “He’s not a ‘rah-rah’ coach. It’s understood
what we have to do.”

Jackson carries that same baseball intensity off
the field. He ’s constantly reading, watching other
coaches and going to clinics in his free time. “I’m
always trying to learn.” He invests a lot of time in
his work.

“It’s not like punching a clock,” he said. “You
do it because you enjoy it. It’s all worthwhile
when you see players reach their potential and
when you have a season like this year. Time is not
really a factor.”

All Jackson asks is that his playersrespect the
fact he ’s committed to the program, and that com-

mitment is reciprocated. If that continues to hap-/9

pen, Pitt might be on its way to being a mainstay
in the Top 25 for years to come.

“He’s the most competitive coach I’ve ever
seen in my life,” Kramer said. “He hates to lose.
He’s a winner, no doubt about it.” 4

And if percentages are correct about Jackson,
those two trophies that peer over his desk will
multiply into a skyscraping city.
