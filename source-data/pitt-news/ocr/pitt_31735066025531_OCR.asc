The new chair of
the student allocations
committee says new
guidelines will make it
nearly impossible for
individuals to embez-
zle funds.

Disciplinary
charges now face for-
mer chair Gerald
Klayman and five oth-

ing nearly $4000 from
the activities fund he
oversaw. , 7

It won’t happen
again, according to
Klayman's successor,
Chris Boback.

That's _ because
Boback is beginning
the semester with less
power than Pitt's allo-
cations chair did in
1997 after -allocations
adviser Terrence

allocations manual in
late December.

"It takes away uni-
lateral decision mak-
ing," said Boback, a
junior. "That's totally
gone."

From now on, at
least three allocations
committee members
need to vote on fund-
ing requests from offi-
cial student groups,
even during the sum-

_ the only time a bus is leaving down-

  
   
 
   
 
 

So you call
around to all  0
your’ friends 
and ask if they .
can offer you a ride in that general
direction, but no one's a taker; and

town Pittsburgh for your desti-
nation is 3:00 a.m. Somehow,
the thought of sleeping on a bus
in the middle of the night with

a bunch of strangers doesn't

sound appealing.

' AntiOnline is back ——- but not through
Pitt’s Internet system.

Last November, Pitt pulled the plug
and ﬁled judicial charges on the creator of
the website dedicated to keeping computer
users aware of
security prob-
lems on their
PCs.

On Jan. 5,
1998 AntiOnline
reopened on a
State College,
P a . — b a s e d
Internet service
provider called LAZERLink As a result,
Pitt's judicial charges against it's owner,
John Vranesevich, and his friends who
helped out with the site, were dropped.

These developments came after
Vranesevich struck a deal with Pitt in mid-

 
  
  
      

December to keep the site open in l'llS dorm Anuonune’ page 4

You consider ﬂying, but immedi-
ately think of the cost involved.

However, due to USAirways' E-
savers program, it may not be as
expensive as you think.

It’s no secret that ﬂights can have
empty seats, especially on the week-
ends, because many people travel

early so they can spend their whole,

weekend vacationing or working.
And as Craig Bohna, manager of
University Travel Services on Forbes
Avenue, says, "The most expensive
seat to [airlines] is an empty one."

Therefore, it comes ‘as no surprise
that some domestic airlines, particu-
larly USAirways, have taken steps to
fill the often-vacant weekend seats,
using cheap rates and the ticketless
service to entice ﬂiers. '

Basically, through E-savers trav-
ellers reserve a seat aboard a ﬂight
without actually receiving a paper
ticket. Travellers can save a seat in
one of three ways: via the
USAirways website, at the airport or
through a travel agent.

Because it can be inconvenient in
Pittsburgh, and because seats fill up
quickly, most people don’t purchase
an E-saver seat at the airport. Also,

Agency located on Craig Street, a
ticket to Boston from Pittsburgh
would normally cost a person around

$200 for a round trip ﬂight. Under

the USAirways' E-savers program the
cost is $89. ,

While the savings are substantial,
they do come with a set of restric-
tions. ' A

The discounts change from week
to week which means that people
who purchase a ticket must do so
between Wednesday and Saturday,
and must be ready to ﬂy to their des-
tination that weekend. As some stu-
dents suggested, this could present
problems.

"The thing that is bad about [E-
savers] is that they don't allow for
advance planning," said Pitt fresh-
man Melissa Swem. "I usually don't
go home on the spur of the moment,
plus I don't have $79 to drop just like
that."

Fliers are forced to depart on a
Saturday and return no later than

Tuesday under the E-saver program. \

If students have Monday classes that
can’t be missed, they are looking at
spending a day and a half at home, at

wins freedom of speech case’ 

Across the Nation

PHILADELPHIA — A federal judge
has ruled that Kutztown University
violated an assistant philosophy pro-
fessor’s right to free speech when it
denied him a tenure-track position.
Richard Ha1l’s opinions raised
eyebrows among his colleagues. He
openly opposed multicultural educa-
tion, saying he abhorred certain soci-
eties.

meeting in 1994, the year after Hall
was hired as a temporary assistant phi-
losophy professor at Kutztown.

Espousing a philosophy of moral
absolutism, Hall told of practices such
as female circumcision in the Sudan,
slavery in other African countries,
bride-buming in India, and discrimina-
tion against women in Islamic coun-
tries. He said Westerners have a moral
duty to stand up against such evils.

U.S. District Judge Franklin van
Antwerpen asked both sides yesterday
to file briefs on the damages sustained
by Hall. He is a naturalized U.S. citi-
zen from England who now lives in
Fayetteville, N.C.

HAZELTON, Pa. — Maybe you can’t
lick city hall, but you sure can scare it.

Especially when you leave a snake
on the premises.

The folks who work in the
Hazelton, Pa. city hall got a bit ner-
vous when they heard a Burmese
python was on the loose.

The young snake had been deliv-
ered to a health officer Jan. 9 by a man
who said he’d caught it on a local road.

The man left the two—foot snake in
a cloth bag hanging on a doorknob.
The health officer found the bag and
went to find a snake handler.

When he returned later that day,
the snake had gotten free.

Yesterday, the health officer found
the python coiled inside a percolator in
a box on the ﬂoor.

MORAVIA, N.Y. — She’s senior
class president, a member of students
against drunk driving, an all-star ath--
lete and an honor student.

But if Amber Long wants to grad-
uate, she’ll have to lose that eyebrow
ring.
That’s the ultimatum from officials
at Moravia High School in the finger
Lakes region of New York State.

Long is a senior who had her eye-
brow pierced in November. She says
she likes to be different.

Now, school officials have refused
to allow her to participate in gym class
wearing the copper—colored ring over

The case stems from a faculty

a
i

her eye. And if she gets an incomplete }
in gym, she can’t graduate. 3

The administratogs say they’re}‘
governed by state rules. But state offi- -;
cials say there is no such policy on‘:

jewelry. ,

RIMERSBURG, Pa. — Maybe when 5
pro football players butt heads, the TV 3
screen should ﬂash a message that
says, “Don’t try this at home.” ,

It might have helped a man ini
Rimersburg, Pa. ,

State police say the man’s girl—§
friend got mad when he playfully‘
butted her head Sunday before the
Pittsburgh—Denver game for the AFC
title.

According to the police, the
woman went ballistic. They say she{
butted him three times, threw hot cof-
fee on him and gouged two bleeding
wounds in his neck.

The woman has been charged with

domestic violence. 

Around the World

MONTREAL —- It’s looking to bet
quite a wait for some of the more than
one million Canadians beginning their l
second week without power today. .

Officials say some parts aroundi
Montreal may not have electricity
restored for another week or two.

Relief efforts following ’ last
week’s paralyzing ice storm are focus-
ing on an area south and west of
Montreal dubbed the “Black Triangle.” 3
That’s were hundreds of thousands are 1
powerless because of dozens of metal
transmission towers that were toppledi
by heavy ice.

Meanwhile, officials -are urging
those still living in frigid homes to ,
leave them for warmer shelter.

OSLO, Norway —— Seats in the smok-
ing section could go to the highest bid-
der in Norwegian restaurants.

At least one restauranteur wants to
start auctioning the smoking tables. He
says in a newspaper interview that new
anti-smoking laws are costing him
money.

Under the laws, at least half of all
seats in restaurants and bars must be
smoke-free. Trouble is, even non-
smokers seem to prefer sitting with
friends who do smoke.

The result is smoke-free sections
that are almost empty — and smoking
sections that are overﬂowing.

The restaurant owner who’s con-
sidering auctioning thinks they’d serve
a useful purpose. He says, “If nothing
else, I would demonstrate how stupid I
think this new law is.”

bined with the short trip length and
the no—refund policy makes some

~‘ wary to hop a ﬂight with an E—saver.

However, this wariness by no
means applies to everyone. ,

Paul Williams, a Pitt graduate
and WPTS staff member, likes the

the opportunity to make a weekend
getaway, he jumped at the chance —
aboard an E-saver headed straight for

"Normally, I pay $60 for an eight
hour Greyhound drive, so when I
heard I could get a half-hour to 45

offer," he said. "For the time and the
expense, I am willing to put up with

ALLOCATIONS

mer. The allocations committee sug-
gests how a percentage of students’
tuitions is divided among campus
organizations.

This change may be a result of
suggestions to change the allocations
process — especially during the sum-
mer months from Student
Government Board candidates in
November. These suggestions were

‘prompted by allegations that then-

Allocations Chair Klayman stole
thousands of dollars because no allo-
cations committee members were
around between April and September,
giving him ample opportunity to take
the money unnoticed.

Although this change will make it
difficult for an allocations chair to
steal money, the SGB still has free-
reign over how much money a stu-
dent group receives, and needs not
heed the suggestions of the alloca-
tions committee.

Sometimes this unchecked power
creates tension between the board
and allocations.

For example, all 10 members of
last year's allocations committee, of
which Boback was a member,
resigned in mid-September because
of the SGB's "blatant misuse of
funds." _

Boback and his 10 new commit-
tee members, selected by a few mem-
bers of this year's and last year's
SGBS, aren't thinking about that right
now.

Instead, he's more concerned

FROM PAGE 1

about getting through the spring bud-
getary process. During January,
February and March, every student
group proposes a budget to the com-
mittee. The committee then reviews
each request, presents its suggestion
to the SGB, and the SGB makes a
final decision on a group's budget
amount.

"My goal for now is survival,"

Boback said with a laugh about the

next few months.

Boback climbed the ladder in stu-
dent government at Pitt for three
years to reach his new position.
Freshman year, he was a member of
Emerging Leaders, which requires its
members to join an organization. He
became a part of the elections com-
mittee, and served as the elections
chair in the fall of 1996 and 1997.

In the fall of 1996 he was con-
vinced by now—SGB President
Alyson Wallach to apply for the allo-
cations committee and got the job.
He resigned with the other nine mem-
bers in September and, applied to
serve as the committee's chair in
"late—November or early—December."

He claims his application’ wasn't
an attempt to restore a good name to
the position Klayman tarnished in
many students‘ eyes. In fact, he does-
n't feel as if students have any reason
to associate him with Klayman.

"I hope I wouldn't be prejudged
for what Gerry did," said Boback. "I
haven't done anything; I don't think I
have to clear my name."

ited transfers, unlimited ban length, and 24—
hour problem—solving tech support.
Vranesevich said the LAZERLink setup
is much better than the one that he had on the

' Pitt server.

Pitt spokesman Ken Service agreed that
the situation was resolved in a way that was
desirable for both Vranesevich and Pitt.

He did say that he feels that Vranesevich
was "mistaken in his interpretation" of the
agreement between he and Pitt, and that the
University didn't renege on the agreement.

"In the future," he said. "The University
will take a look at how things are worded to
avoid misunderstanding."

David Stevens, the representative from
LAZERLink that represents AntiOnline, was

not available for comment.

Vranesevich started AntiOn1ine when he
was a sophomore in high school. Last semes-
ter, as freshman at Pitt, he set up the site in his
Towers dorm room. ‘

Controversy arose in November when
Pitt shut down the site, stating that AntiOnline
was using Pitt's educational network (.edu)
for commercial purposes.

In addition, Vranesevich and two ﬁiends
who helped with the site, Robert Dailey and
Christopher Zilinski, lost their lntemet capa-
bilities, including e-mail, and were banned
from all campus computer labs.

Pitt ﬁled judicial complaints against the
three students but told them the charges
would be dropped if they signed a document
that disallowed their discussion of the matter
with anyone, in addition to agreeing not to
publish the site.

Dailey and Zilinski signed the document

Wednesday, 14 January 1998». '

 

to smooth things over with the University, but 
Vranesevich refused. l

He later signed an agreement that l
allowed him to keep the site open in his dorm as 1
room as a not—for-proﬁt site, but said Pitt oﬂi— ‘
cials changed their minds. f 1

In December, LAZERLink offered to 
keep the site running for Vranesevich and i
gave him and Dailey the freedom they need- , 
ed to keep it successful. ,

AntiOnline is best known for discover- 
ing a bug called "WmNuke" which is a
Wmdows95 glitch that allowed hackers to
lock up computers when the owners logged
onto the Internet. 1

"I decided that Pitt wouldn't ever appre— l
ciate what we're doing with AntiOnline,"
Vranesevich said. "So I decided to move to a I
server who would.

"I'm very happy with the way things are
now," he added.

The Pitt News

Textbooks: Should Fox Mulder investigate?

Carrie Hager
Columnist

This semester, I went to
buy my books a couple days
before classes started, hoping
to avoid the crowds and be
able to get mostly used books,
which are often much cheaper
than new ones. This fantasy
was shattered shortly after I
arrived at the Book Center.

I was amazed at the num-
ber of students already there. I
guess everyone else had the
same idea I did: get there early
to avoid the lines. As I pushed
my way through the hordes of
students crowding the narrow
aisles filled with overpriced
books, I faced one disappoint-
ment after another.

I was only able to get
about one quarter of my books
used (I had to buy 20), and the
used books were not much
cheaper than the new ones.
Some of the used books I
bought were only a couple dol-
lars cheaper than the new ones.
I had always thought used
books were supposed to be
much cheaper, but apparently
not. Some of my books were
not even in yet, and still are
not today. _

As the woman ringing up
my order cheerfully told me
my total was $360, I wondered
how she slept at night, know-
ing she is an accessory to this
big ‘rip-off scheme. I know I
could never work there. I
couldn’t wait on a line of crest-
fallen students all day, smile at
their pain and still be able to
look myself in the mirror.

At least if we got a lot for

selling back books it wouldn’t
be so bad, but the truth of it is,
unless you are lucky, you get
next to nothing for selling your
books.

When I walked toward the
counter to sell my books back,
I was confident I would get a
reasonable sum of money
back.

I guess I was just naive.

The Book Center wouldn’t
even buy back certain books
because new editions had been
printed (apparently, new edi-
tions are published almost
every semester). For other
books, I was offered less than a
fourth of what I had paid for
them new.

Even worse, I was offered
$1.50 for books that cost me
over $11. I told them I would
rather keep my books, or
maybe even burn them, than
accept the pittance they were
offering me.

Many students I have
talked to have had similar neg-
ative experiences —— or worse
— when they bought their
books. I friend of mine paid
$28 for a packet of papers put
together by Copy Cat. It
should be a crime to charge so
much for something that prob-
ably cost $0.75 to print. But
they can charge as much as
they want because we need the
books for class.

I had always thought there
were laws to protect con-
sumers from outrageous
prices, but I guess I was wrong
about that, too. The laws must
not have been designed to pro-
tect college students.

On the other hand, college

THE PITT NEWS

students aren’t really the con-
sumers. The professors who
choose the ridiculously expen-
sive books are the real con-
sumers. We just have to fork

up the cash.

Something must be done to
stop" colleges from ripping stu-
dents off every chance they
get. The school already gets
thousands of dollars per stu-
dent each year for tuition, so
why does it need to charge so
much for books?

There must be some con-
spiracy surrounding the sale of
textbooks, and I have come up
with a few conspiracy theories.
Maybe some professors get
paid off by the book company
if they agree to require certain
books for a class.

I’m sure ‘no professor
would ever admit to it, but I’ll
bet some get kickbacks from
book companies. If they don’t
get cash, they must get a paid
vacation to the Bahamas —— the
book companies could certain-
ly afford that.

And there must be some-
thing underhanded involved in
how books seem to switch edi-
tions almost every semester
and you can’t sell them back.

Something definitely needs
to be done about the price of
textbooks. Unfortunately, I
don’t think anything short of
an angry mob looting the Book
Center will get them to do any-
thing about it. I’m not even
sure that would work.

Carrie Hager thinks people
should forget UFOs and start
investigating the textbook con-
spiracy.

Credit cards, bill collectors
and Tickle Me Cookie Monster

 

Now that the needles have fallen
from your trees and the candles in the
menorah have dwindled to stubs, it’s
the time of year to consider that maybe
you were exposed to mind-altering
drugs just moments before you decid-
ed that putting all of your holiday
shopping expenses on a credit card
couldn’t possibly hurt.

Now, such things as eating a three-
course meal of crushed glass, razors

and syringes followed by a nutritious _

gallon of salt water or performing non-
anesthetized open heart surgery on
yourself with plastic garden tools both
seem to rank well below last month’s
holiday charging on the pain scale.

It makes you wonder why our gov-
ernment is chasing Microsoft around
with monopoly allegations when it’s
clear our holiday icons obviously are
in some sort ofrcollusion with the
VISA and MasterCard companies.
And you wonder why their “work-
shops” are so clandestine. (Also see
next week’s topic: “You say Santa, I
say Satan, let’s call the whole season
off.”) ’

And while the Santa Claus giveth,
the credit card repayment clause

taketh away. That’s why every year,-

around the middle of January, a large
portion of Americans are visited by
another — less anticipated +— holiday
icon: Vito “The Cleaner” Carlotovese.

It is Vito’s job, more or less, to
make sure you pay off your credit card
bills, even if it requires making certain
family members “disappear” -—— or

reappear, based on your relationship
with them. This is indeed a disturbing
concept (though not as unsettling for
me as seeing the increasing frequency
for grocery products that advertise
they are, “Now richer and creamier!”).

Let me tell you as much as anyone
really knows about our post-holiday
pal. Vito is not jolly. In fact, he’s 310
pounds, 6-foot-6 and eats small for-
eign-made vehicles — and people —
for fun. His black 1973 Cadillac does
jingle, but largely from an overwhelm-
ing presence of the brass knuckles and
gold fillings that fill his trunk. He also
goes through more baseball bats in one
week than all three major league base-
ball divisions do in a decade. (For

those of you not baseball-inclined,

they break a lot of bats. A whole lot.
Vito breaks them over people’s body
parts. Which hurts a lot. A whole lot.)

Vito is best described as a
“Santithesis,” to continue in the spirit

-of my Judeo-Christian—based analo-

gies. Instead of little boys and girls
going to such extremes as sitting
behind a construction-paper blind in
anticipation of seeing him, older folks
(yes, get used to hearing that) go to
such extremes as volunteering for the
first manned mission to Neptune to
avoid Vito. Well, you can run, but you
can’t hide.

Getting Dad that nice bottle of
P010 instead of the standby Old Spice
probably now seems a lot like choos-
ing to forgo an entire limb instead of
having to just clip your nails. I hate to
be the one to break this to you (sorry,
I’ll try and use different terms — this
is a sensitive subject) but you can’t get
out of paying your bills by marking
“Retum to sender —— addressee has
moved,” because Vito will still find
you. (At least three times, but I’m
planning to “move” again soon.)

Legalized daily name changes can
slow Vito down, however, as long as
you go from city to city and avoid
using the same office twice in one
year.

Obligatory service message from
Marc Nuzzo to legally free him from
any potential “He-told—m_e-to-do—it”
defenses out there: Credit card fraud
is a crime! Shame on you for even
thinking about it!

Mr. Carlotovese, as he prefers us
to call him, has a pretty darn smooth
track record for a man who carries 97
pounds worth of bludgeoning utensils
in his back pocket. In the past, he has
gone so far in his credit-evasion track-
ing as to locate the real—life John Doe
and teach Jimmy Hoffa a “lesson he’ll
never forget,” about bribing lawmak-
ers with his American Express.

Vito has also gone down three
fathoms with the sinking Titanic to
retrieve money from one of the ill-
fated bellhops, Tony Viscatelli. (And

Gymnastsimake home debut this Sunday

 

Christine Coates

For The Pitt News

The athletes of the
University of Pittsburgh’s
gymnastics team are set to
begin their season this
Sunday, Jan. 18 at 2:00 p.m.
against West Virginia at the
Fitzgerald Field House.

. Coming off last year’s
13-12 record and a ﬁfth
place finish at NCAA
Regionals, the team is men-
tally and physically ready to
have a even better season.

1 “We made amazing
strides last year,” said
Coach Debbie Yohman. “I
think the team’s goals are to
step above last year. The
girls need to stay focused on
all events and not get too
excited toward the end of
the meets.”

Just what does it take to
improve over last season?

. Well  a lot of time, dedica-

tion and heart. The gym-
nasts work out four or more
hours a day, ﬁve days a
week, and also have an
extra day of conditioning
thrown in the mix. Their
training for the season starts
at the beginning of the fall
semester and goes until the
season ends in late April.
The team will look to

one of its experienced mem-
bers —- Janet Highhill, a
junior — for leadership,
according to Yohman. She
has competed in all four
events over the past two
years. I-Iighhill’s strongest
event is the uneven bars, but
her ﬂoor exercise routine is
now up to level and is she
performing well on the
beam and vault according to
Yohman. .
But the team may be
without her for the Sunday
meet. ,
“Things are up in the
air,” said Highhill. She
recently injured her wrist
and will have an MRI done
on Friday. If everyone can
stay healthy, Highhill
expects the team to do well
and have a great season.
Another key weapon on
the gymnastics team is
junior Erika Flamer. She is
an all-arounder, participat-
ing in all of the events
offered -— uneven bars, bal-
ance beam, vault and ﬂoor
exercise. According to her
coach, she is a very’power-
ful gymnast who is fun to
watch and should develop
to be a great vaulter. ‘

The Pitt men’s and women’s track
teams avoided falling into a trap at
last Saturday’s West Virginia
University Invitational meet.

Official team scores were kept, a
rare occurrence for an indoor meet.

“It was enticing to bite on, but we
decided to ignore the team scoring
aspect,” said Pitt Head Coach Steve
Lewis. “We came in to work in prepa-
ration for bigger and better things.”

That attitude may have saved a
lot of trouble. The Pitt women battled
West Virginia’s squad in virtually

every event, highlighted by the 60-
meter hurdles. Pitt’s Trecia Smith,
Ayana Coleman, and Kianga Lee took
first, third and fourth place, with
three Mountaineers filling out the top
six. The Panthers felt that was one too
many.

“With a little closer scrutiny, I
think Joetta Purter would’ve been in
the top six also,” Lewis said. “We
thought we clearly had four women in
the top six, but we didn’t wantto get
involved with that.” »

The final score for the women
had West Virginia on top with 172

points. Pitt’s women were second.

with 122.5, far ahead of the other four

Team score set aside, team members qualify for postseason

schools. Pitt’s men finished fourth
with 47.5 points. Penn State won with
166. .

But Pitt’s goals were primarily
individual ones. The first goal was to
get as many athletes as possible qual-
ified for the various championship
meets at the end of the season.

Another was to get some young
athletes competing against Division I
colleges. The Panthers were largely
successful on both counts.

Most of the women’s field events
were going on at the same time as the
track events, so many of the women

Don’t get me wrong; his statistics
are pretty good. He’s averaging 7.4

shooting (.778 from .651).

Winter break losses the least
of Pitl hockey’s holiday worries

Rachel Lenzi

_ according to Chouinard

Staff Writer

Sometimes change can be good, at least
for the Pitt hockey team. And changes aplen-
ty came the Panthers’ way before, during
and after the holiday break.

Pitt dropped its record to 1-10 with loss-
es to league opponents Indiana and Kent
State during the holiday break and the 7-2
loss to Drexel University on Sunday after-
noon. The defeats were minor setbacks,
though, after the house-cleaning campaign
that Head Coach Wade Chouinard
embarked on before the 
holiday break.

Gone are defense-
man Mark Marzean
and wingers Mike
Girvin, Matt Danzuso
and Ryan Moore, all of
whom left the team due
to disciplinary reasons.
The Panthers are only
carrying a 15-man ros-
ter; the departures were
part of the team’s
elforts to weed out any
players hurting team
morale —— part of the
hockey team’s ﬁagile
rebuilding process —

 

and the remaining play-
ers.

These departures,
along with the three
losses, didn’t concern the Panthers as much
as did the injured reserve list. After the holi-
day break, the Pitt contingent better resem-

j bled something out of “Gray’s Anatomy”

rather than a hockey team.
The Panther goaltending corps suffered

A a blow when backup goaltender Ian

Lebwohl tore cartilage in his knee on Nov. 9

‘ against the Steel City Stars. He has not
_ appearedinuniforrn since and is not seeking

physical therapy or surgery.

“I’m out for the rest of the season,”
Lebwohl said. “If I play again, it all depends
on what my knee decides to do.”

Goaltenders Patrick Kenny and Dave

   
  

Ciarletta will split the goaltending duties for
the remainder of the season.

Bill MacLean was lost in the IUP game
when he suffered a slight shoulder separa-
tion. The freshrnan defenseman was
checked into the boards, sustaining the
injury, immediately following Pitt’s ﬁrst
goal. Although he tried to play another shift,
MacI.ean was in too much pain and went to
the emergency room after the second period.
Trainers feared a possible rotator culf tear,
but an MRI revealed otherwise.

MacI.ean will begin physical therapy

this weekend.

“I skated last
Tuesday, but the shoul-
der hurt even more,”
said MacLean. “I’m
going to talk to the
therapist this weekend,
and it’s all going to
depend on what hap-
pens in therapy. I’d
love to come back and
play later on this sea-
son, but if not I’H have
to take it easy and get
ready for next season.”

D e f e n s e m a 11
Mark Hoehn suffered
cracked ribs in the loss
to the physical IUP
team. Although he
practiced with the
team last night at
BladeRunners ~ in
Cranberry, Hoehn’s
status is still indeﬁnite for next week’s game
against the Naval Academy.

“It’s completely the coach’s decision,
not mine,” Hoehn said. “I’ve been out for a
while and we’re going to see how the ribs
hold up in practice.”

Senior defenseman Bill Teskey also left
the hockey team to begin a job related to his
major.

Pitt takes on the Academy “B” team on
Monday aftemoon at Neville Ice Arena in
the South Side. Face off is 12:30 p.m. In the
last meeting between these two teams, the
Midshipmen defeated the Panthers, 4-1, on
Nov. 7.

crowd (read: enough Pitt fans to
combat the thousand or so that will
travel from Connecticut to see the
game) could make the difference.

In covering Lady Panther basket-
ball on and off for the past two and a
half years, I’ve seen a good number
of depressing moments. Games that

~ could have turned around a season

didn’t. Shots that could have won
close contests didn’t. Players that
could have been great weren’t.

But on Jan. 6, there was another
sad moment, probably the worst
ever

In front of the band, the trainers,
the coaches, the reporters and a few
Rutgers fans, the Lady Panthers took

the Scarlet Knights to school, notch~
ing a 10-point win over a team
picked as the preseason Big East
Seven division champion.

Pitt was picked seventh.

As Balich and Montesano hit
clutch second—half jumpers, as the
seconds ticked away, as the improba-
ble slowly became probable, some-
thing unusual began to happen.

Pitt players began to smile.

Montesano looked like she’d just

been handed a check by Ed
.McMahon.

of the night diving into the bleach-
ers, onto the track, or into other play-

ers to get loose balls, was jumping
up and down even more than normal.

Even Kirk Bruce, the Lady
Panther head coach who had won 17
games in the past three seasons up to
that point, slowly cracked a rare
smile.

The buzzer blared.

The band cheered.

L Montesano showcased her verti—’
cal leap, soaring at least two feet into
the air as the clock hit zero. The team
could barely contain its emotions as
the ritual line—up—and—s1ap—hands—
with—the—opponent ceremony took
place.

Then, just as the squad was ready
to re—start the hysterics, the band
played the alma mater. Everyone
bowed in respect.

Wednesday, 14 January 1998

 

Montesano let out a “Whoo!” that
probably blew out the eardrums of
the horn section. It was a moment of
sheer jubilation absent from this
campus since the Pitt—Virginia Tech
football game, only minus the fans
—— attendance for the Rutgers game
fell in the mid-100s.

That’s a pity.

And it would be even more of a
pity if 100 or less Pitt fans are on
hand this evening to see the Lady
Panthers take a chance at downing
Goliath. Swallow your apathy and
sports gender bias inone gulp and go
watch some hoops.

Kevin Lilley is the sports editor of
The Pitt News. Admission to
tonight’s game is free of charge for
Pitt students, ify0u’re wondering.

couldn’t compete in as many events as
they normally would. Still, Smith
managed to win ‘the shot put with only
one attempt, a throw of 45-6 1/2, as
well as the long jump, with 20-3 1/2.
Both marks qualify her for the
ECAC championships. Smith’s win-
ning time of 8.75 seconds in the 60-
meter hurdles is also an ECAC quali-

» fying time.

Pitt’s other ECAC qualifier was
Anna Kohler. Kohler ran only one
event, the 1000 meters, but she won it
with a time of 2:57.

Several other Panthers won their
events. Joetta Purter won the 800
meters in 2:17, Gina Bundy won the
triple jump with a mark of 37 feet, 9
1/2 inches, and Rashida Daniels won
the weight throw with a distance of 42
feet.

The men also had their share of 1.

winners and IC4A championship meet
qualifiers.

Jack Jeffreys’ time of 8.1.9 sec-
onds in the 60—meter hurdles earned
him third place and a trip to the IC4A
meet. Tim Tyre got the same package
with his 22.16 seconds in, the 200
meters.

In his first competition of the
indoor season, newcomer Sekou
Dilday won the 400 meters with 49.88
seconds, an IC4A qualifying time.

Perhaps the most impressive
showing for the men came in the
4x400—-meter relay. 1

“We wanted to see who our fastest
quarter—milers are,” Head Coach
Lewis said. “We want to make sure we
get our four fastest in that relay. We
think we have a shot at qualifying for
the national championship, which
would be a first for us.”

The team of Dilday, Tyre, Greg
Blake, and Carl Taylor took the first
step toward that goal. They won the
relay and qualified for the IC4A
championship ‘with a time of 3:19.
