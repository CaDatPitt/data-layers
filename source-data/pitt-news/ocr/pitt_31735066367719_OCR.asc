SG States Plans

For Consideration

In 3rd Trimester

SG ﬁrst objective in the Spring
Trimester will be completing the
action on the petitions to the State
Legislature supporting the bill
which reduces the four per cent
sales tax on school supplies and
text books.

7'While there will not be suffi-
cient senators present during the
third trimester to constitute a

quorum under the constitution,’

SG will meet as a planning body.

Among those items that SG will
consider this spring will be the
possibility of obtaining a discount
at the University Book Center
for students, a student book ex-
change for September, and the
revival of identiﬁcation cards.

They will -«also look into a‘
leadership training program,
more effective pep rallies, and
a new date and rules for SG
elections.

Also under consideration is the
introduction of a special activi-
ties period, improved health fa-
cilities, and an honors code.

Finally SG will consider ways
of helping-organizations conform
to the new University discrimina-
tion policy, which will take effect
in 1966.

In the event that a resolution
is brought up, proxy ballots will
be solicited from those senators
not present and only by receiving
the votes from the minimum of
senators constituting a quorum
will the motion be carried or de-
feated. ' ‘

 

Quadrangle
Businesses
Plan Moves

Yohe’s drug store, located
on the Fifth Avenue side of
the Schenley Quadrangle,
will eventually occupy the
area of Jay’s bookstore and
the L. G. Balfour Company.

George Yohe, owner, said that
they would not move into the new
area until after May 10 since the
University could not begin re-
modeling the place until the ﬁrst
of May.

Redecoration l-ncludes removing

the partitions between the two
stores, raising the windows, paint-
ing and adding additional furni-
ture. .
. Yohe explained that they hope
to remain an integral part of the
University and that students
would continue to use their facili-
ties.

Each of the merchants that
owned stores in the quadrangle
were notified on March 8 that
their leases w0ul.d terminate at
the end of April.

Jay Dantry, owner of the book
store, will move this Saturday to
3802,Fifth Avenue, one block from
the University’s Book Center; the
Balfour Company will move to
the Physicians Building, 121 Uni-
versity Place. ‘

Moving, however, is not-restrict-

V ed to the occupants of the Forbes

side of the quadrangle. Edward’s
Beauty Salon, Bolan’s, the travel
agency and the gift shop on the
Fifth Avenue side will also be
leaving this week end.

This area will be temporarily
used by the Mellon Bank, which
is presently situated on the cite
of the new dormitory. “

$40,500 Donated For Nuclear Studies

University Receives Science Grants

By BOB SCHWIMMER

, The National Science Founda-
tion and the Atomic Energy Com-
mission have‘, recently‘ awarded
the University a total of $40,000
to establish a nuclear chemistry
laboratory and to explore the
mechanisms of nuclear reactions.

The National Science Founda-
tion grant, amounting to $12,500,
will be matched with an equal
sum by the University. This
money will be used for the pur-
chase of ‘laboratory “furniture”.
The A. E. C. grant of $28,000 came
in the form of a contract with
the University for the study of

the reactions of sub-atomic par-
ticles.

Dr. Robert L. Wolke, asso-
ciate professor of chemistry,
will head the project. “These
two grants ‘represent the begin-
ning of nuclear chemistry re-
search at the University,” Dr.
Wolke said, also mentioning
that the study ‘will be-under-
taken “in close co-operation
with the physics department”,
and thus “has the salutary ef-
fect of bringing the two depart- A
ments together”.

Dr. Wolke hopes to study the
mechanism of nuclear reactions
by the ‘bombardment of IDeuteron,r

   

 

 

while Cooper, Director of the Stu-
dent Union," will transfer to Tren-

‘ton State College in New Jersey

where he will be Director of Stu-

dent Affairs and._Auxiliary Enter-

prises.

A graduate of Dartmouth Col-
lege, Dr. Swartzbaugh, who pres-
ently coordinates the activities of
the Dean of Men, the Dean of

Women and the Student Union,’

received his masters and doctorate
degrees in psychology _at "Ohio
State University. He also holds a
Bachelor of Divinity from Yale
University. ‘
Taught At Dennison

He has taught sociology at Den-
nison College and served an army
assignment teaching at the Armed
Forces Institute.

At Amherst, Dr. Swartz-V
baugh will be‘, in his own
words, “responsible for every-
thing after the old New Eng-
land tradition of a college
dean.” “Everything” will en-
tail admission, student affairs,
fraternity advising and
demic and general ‘counseling.-
When‘ asked how he felt about
leaving the University, Dr.

Swartzbaugh replied, “I havehad
a very exciting time at the Uni-
versity and have many regrets
about leaving the many personal
contacts I have made with stu-
dents, faculty members and my
fellow administrators.”
Taught Economics

Cooper, who has been with the
University for two years, com-
pletedfliis undergraduate work at
Grove City College and received
his master’s degree from the Uni-
versity ’ of Pennsylvania.

After leaving the University
of Pennsylvania he worked for
four years for the American
Friends Service Commission
and for seven years in industry

Dr. Peter Safar

Named to Head
Anesthesiology

The University’s School of
Medicine has announced the ap-
pointment of the first fulltime
professor and chairman of its
Department of Anesthesiology.

Dr. Peter Safar, chief of the
department of anesthesiology of
Baltimore City Hospital, will suc-
ceeds Dr. George J. Thomas, who
has served as part-time chairman
of the department for the last 28

years.

Dr’. Safar is noted for his re-

search work in the ﬁeld of resus-

citation or restoration of life to
one who- is unconscious or ap-
parently dead. The most signiﬁ-
cant result of his research has
been proof that manual artiﬁcial
respiration often fails and that
mouth—to—mouth resuscitation is
far superior.

His work, together with
studies in Buffalo and Chicago,
has brought about a world-
wide change from the old type
of artiﬁcial respiration to the
mouth-to-mouth method.

Dr. Safar also has been study-
ing the role of air way obstruction
in resuscitation and, more recent-
ly, has worked with his colleague,
Dr. J. Reading, on drowning.

A native of Vienna, Austria, Dr.
Safar received his M.D. degree
from the University of Vienna in
1948. He took post-graduate train-
ing in pathology and surgery in
Vienna.

A ‘ROBE BY ANY OTHER NAME

As Commencement Day draws near, the question on everyone’.
lips is: “How did the diiierent disciplines come to be marked by
academic robes with hoods of diilerent colors?” Everybody-
but everybody-—is asking it. I mean I haven’t been ablelto Walk
ten feet on any campus in America without somebody grabs my
elbow and says, “How did the different disciplines come to be
marked by academic robes with hoods of different colors, hey?!
This, I must say, is not the usual question asked by collegiam
who grab my elbow. Usually they say, “Hey, Shorty, got ,
_ Marlboro?” And this is right and proper. After all, are they not
coliegians, and, therefore, the nation’s leaders in lntelligenog
and discernment? And do not intelligence and discernment de-
mand the tastiest in tobacco ﬂavor and smoking pleasure? And
does not Marlboro deliver a ﬂavor that is uniquely mellow, a
selectra-te ﬁlter that is easy drawing, a pack that is soft, in box
that is hard? You know it!

  

WM /6175 ax/ax///ax?’

But I digress. Back to the colored hoods of academic robes.
A doctor of philosophy wears’ blue, a doctor of medicine wears
green, a master of arts ‘wears white, a doctor of humanities wears
crimson, a master of library science wears lemon yellow. Why?
Why, for example, should a master of .library science wear lemon
yellow? ‘ ,

Well sir, to answer this vexing question, we must go back to
March 29, 1844. On that. date the first public library in the
llmted States was established by Ulric Sigafoos. All of Mr.
Sigafoos s neighbors were of course wildly grateful-all, that
18, except Wrex Todhuntcr. _

Mr. Todhunter had hated Mr. Sigafoos since 1822 when both

men had wooed the beauteous Melanie Zitt and Melanie had

chosen Mr. Sigafoos because she was mad for dancing and Mr.
bxgafoos knew all the latest steps, like the Missouri Compromise
M94350. the Sh_ay’s Rebellion Schottische, and the James K.
Polk Polka, while Mr. Todhunter, alas, could not dance at all
owing to a. wound he had received at the Battle of New Orleans.
(He was struck by a falling praline.)

_ Consumed with jealousy at the success of Mr. Sigafoos’I
libraly, Todhuuter resolved to open a competing library.
This he did, but he lured not a single patron away from Mr.
SI89-f’00s. “What has Mr. Sigafoos got that I havcn’t got?” Mr.
'I:_odhunter kept asking himself, and ﬁnally the answer came to
him: books.

‘So Mr. Todhunter stocked his library with lots of dandy books
and soon he was doing more business than his hated rival.
But ‘Mr. Sigafoos struck back. To regain his clientele, he began
serving tea free of charge at his library every afternoon. There-
upon, Mr. Todhunter, not to be outdone, began serving tea
"W3 ‘War. Thereupon, Mr. Sigafoos began serving tea with
sugar. and cream. The:-eupon, Mr. Todhunter began serving
tea with sugar and cream and lemon,

This, of course, clinched the victory for Mr. Todhunter be-
cause he had the only lemon tree in town-in fact, in the entire
state of North Dakota-and since that day lemon yellow has of
course been the color on the academic robes of library science.

(Incidentally, the defeated Mr. Sigafoos packed up his library
and moved to California where, alas, he failed once more. There
were, to be sure, plenty of lemons to serve with his tea, but,
8138. tl1erc_was no cream because the cow was not introduced
to California until 1931 by John Wayne.) mm M-.1 amm-

_ Dr. King to Direct New Labs

Research Head Named

Basic research laboratories in
experimental psychology are be.-
ing constructed at. Western Psy-
chiatric Institute, Dr. Henry W.
Brosin, director of the institute,
announced.

“The new facilities will repre-
sent a broadening and deepening
of the institute’s research pro-
gram,” Dr. Brosin said. i

Plans for the $122,000 project
call for five new laboratory units
to be completed by June.

One of these units will be
shielded against sound, light,
and electrical inﬂuences, a sec-
ond unit will have special
temperature and humidity con-
trols. and the other three will
be general purpose units.

Dr. Henry E. King, chief of
WPI’s Psychological service and
professor of psychology at the
University, will direct the activi-
ties of the new laboratories. His
personal interest is in psychophy—
siological research, with special
interest in the area of perception.

Dr. King came to Pittsburgh '

in 1960 after serving on the
Tulane University faculty for
ten years. At Tulane, he was a

member of a research team con-
ducting studies in brain psy-
chology.

He has used electrode implanta-
tions to study the effects of brain
stimulation on behavior. Prior to
his Tulane affiliation, Dr. King
was associated with the New York
State Psychiatric Instituteand the
New York State brain research
project.

Fond Farewell

The resignation of two administrator who have always

rated “tops” with students leaves vacancies that will be

hard to ﬁll.

Dr. William Swartzbaugh, Amherst bound in his now
famous Volkswagon, gained a promotion which only con-
ﬁrmsour belief that his role at Pitt during the last four

years was invaluable.

Thesolid foundation for activities in the Student Union,
established by Dr. Swartzbaugh in 1958, has been further
expanded under the direction of William Cooper.

Although what these two administrators did during
their years at Pitt is important, how they affected students
is even more important. V

Both encouraged students to participate in as many
various ﬁelds as possible, and» both treated students as
equals. It is administrators like Dr. Swartzbaugh and Mr.
Cooper that help every student not only accept responsi-
bility but enjoy growing into the type of student that the
University wishes to graduate.

Amherst and Trenton State College gain two admin-
istrators who will be missed by all University members
who knew them.

Post Has te

Opinions on the Eichmann trial stimulated many mem-
bers of the University to write letters to the -Pitt News.
Some constructively criticized Nathan Firestone’s column
and Heinrich Bonstedt’s letter, while others merely an-
swered them. . I l A

Many of the letter writers questioned the lega.lity of
such a trial; others dismissed this judicial problem by com-
paring the Eichmann case with other similar cases.

All of the letters reﬂected attitudes which show per-

sonal animosity among University members.

We have decided not to print any of the letters that
we have received. If we. did, we would only intensify the
amount of friction between persons who either favor or
oppose Israel‘s approach to the case.

In addition, we do not feel that this is a topic which
can be resolved by letters in the Pitt News.

Solitude of the’, Trimester . . .

By Harriet Welmer

During the Spring term, the University’s. atmos-
phere changes. One doesn’t notice the switch at
first because the shadow of the preceding‘ term is
still visible.

But when that fades completely, one becomes
conscious only of the quiet,
empty halls that resound every
step as one walks to class. It is an

that one associates with all small
college campuses; it is evolving
right now, and as it develops it
inspires all Spring trimester stu-
dents to intensify their own in-
tellectual pursuits.

Anyone who ‘attended the
Spring trimester last year knows
the obvious reason for this
change. Most of the unacademic, time consuming
activities have disappeared. I
Pressure Missed .

Yet last year, no one really missed the high-
powered pressure of the first two terms of the tri-
mester year. We enjoyed the more relaxing, con-
templative life at the strange college where we
found ourselves registered."

Misinformecl Agency . . .

Political lntell

By Nathan Firestone
The recent Cuban crisis- should raise the ques-
tion as to whether various government agencies are
set up to advise the President on policy decisions

s or to make policy themselves.

, The role of the CIA in the recent Cuban inva-
sion is fairly obvious. It prac-
ticed a vehement intervention in
Cuba. It was in charge of train-
ing rebel leaders, supplied train-
ing facilities for them, and pre-
sumably gave them the green
light to launch their invasion.
Although President Kennedy was
obviously‘ aware of the CIA’s
operation,‘ many reporters ‘are
doubtful as to whether he gave
CIA the signal to go ahead.

The question is not whether
intervention was justified in Cuba. The question is:
should not the President himself give the ﬁnal
orders to intervene, especially in an area as ﬂamma-
ble as Cuba.

CIA Errs .

The Central Intelligence Agency waswrong in
timing the invasion. It underestimated 'Castro’s
strength and it overestimated the willingness and
the ability of the Cuban citizens to sufficiently dis-
rupt Castro internally, to aid the outside invasion.

This is one of the errors in judgment and will be
dealt with. -‘

But the error that the President made iii per-
mitting this agency to go off by itself and play its

 

less, depends on the individual.

that the University had rid itself of the -abominable
predecessor of Saga. Other than that, it was 3
rather dull term. '

But most of the students who attended last year
found something to do that satisfied them enough
to make the term one of their most enjoyable.
There were lectures to attend, book reviews, Mid-
day Series with poets and folk singers at noon, fol.
lowed by more informal conversations in the after-
noons at the Iced Tea Hours. And in the evening,
one could catch the last three innings of the Pirate
game for nothing, that is, if one couldn’t manage to
get a ticket somewhere.

No Hurry

It will be quiet’ most likely. Students‘ won’t have
to hurry down to the Tuck Shop at noon in order
to get a seat; there will be space to spare. '

Of course, occasionally everyone gets weak
moments and wishes there were more people walk-‘
ing through the halls, but the moment passes
quickly.

games without any effective governmental control
is the serious one. .

,President Kennedy’s actions in the past few
months, have led us to believe'that he will be a
strong president. But a case such as this should
not be permitted to occur under the administra-
tion of a strong president.

Agencies such as the CIA were strengthened
under Eisenhower because he permitted them to
play far too large .a role in policy making. How-
ever, when Kennedy took over, it was his business
to assure the Central Intelligence Agency that its
policy making days‘ were over, and that he, as
President, would rely upon it for nothing more than
thename implies — a reliable source of intelligence
to guide the president as he formulates his policy.
Tostand Alone

When Harry Truman took over after Rooseve1t’s
death, he made it clear to his cabinet that he, and
he alone, was in charge of decision making. Many
resented Truman for thi-s,'but he was right in de-
manding that there be no outside encroachment
on executive decisions._ _

There should be no doubts as to President Ken-
nedy’s courage to make a decision, or his courage to
accept responsibility for the consequences of one
that he has made. But the pity of it is that the

«president must now take responsibility for a de-

cision that was not entirely his. This happened in
the case of the U—2,_and it has happened again.
The consequences are too grave\to have outside
meddling in decisions that should be the Presidents

Letters to the Editor

Coed Bewails
Lack of Break

Editor. The Pitt News.‘

When I decided, to attend the
third trimester back in Septem-
ber of 1960, I was hoping for
some sort of mid-trimester break
or vacation between the two
terms. Later on in the year when
I realized that such vacation
would be non—existent, the full.
impact of its absence never
fully hit me.

Now I know what it means.
and as the trimester progresses
I am sure the signiﬁcance of no
vacation will create a greater
effect‘ not only on myself but on
my fellow students.

 

This means seven solid months
of school work without a break
(excluding minor -holidays like
the Fourth of July). After three
months in the fall I was quite
ready to call it quits w hen
Christmas rolled around. But
now I have been in school for
three more months withthe end
not yet in sight.

Now I ask you, is this wise
educational planning? The stim-
ulus to learn has been-driven to
the breaking point. Surely, our
administrators could have conde-
scended to allow a few days off.
No, oh no, they sit in their ivory
towers, blissfully unaware of the
student plight.

In the heat of summer we will
be dropping’ like flies, falling as
the leaves do fall, dead before

 

October. I think I can weather
the.storm, but a ‘little help on
the part of the administration’
would have been in order.

But, what must be, must be.
Which brings me to another
point. Overlooking our inevitable
doom concerning a vacation, d0
you. think the administration
will show enough mercy to per-
mit bermudas 0n.campus this
summer, or will they stick to
their stodgy rules on clothing’?

I feel we should be allowed
some privilege in repayment for
our perseverence through the
long year. Fellow coeds, number

Lewis Hopeful
Students Fill
Ball Park

When Coach Bobby Lewis
had only a dozen warriors
eligible for the baseball wars
last trimester, he was praying
for rain, in order to postpone
the early contests until he

could get reinforcements from the
freshman ranks.

 Well the gods were kind to

Lewis and six of the initial seven
games were cancelled, but now
that his yearling recruits have
overcome final exams and ha
arrived, he wishes that the deluge
would cease.

With a fresh band of 18 play-
ers. Lewis hopes to entertain
Slippery Rock at home tomorrow.
The Cats will inaugurate their
home schedule at 3:00 at Forbes
Field. i

No Admission
“We hope to have a sellout,”
Lewis confidently remarked, “but
the advance sale hasn’t been what
was expected. We’re limited to
34,009 heals, and We’re not plan-
ning to put up the ropes to keep
the overflowing student body
from getting onto the playing sur-
face.” \ ""
Actually, there is no admission
charged. and it will mark the
Panthers’ sixth attempt to open
their home season. Lewis doesn’t
anticipate any real problems at
the gate, but he is hopeful of a
representative turnout.

Ralph Shutterly has been tab- A

bed to handle the pitching as-

signment. It will be his second

appearance of the embryonic sea-

‘son, having ﬁred for three inn-
ings against California State in‘

the sole battle to date, which the
Panthers lost.
Lineup Changes ,

Lewis plans only two changes
in the starting lineup. He will
patch up the inﬁeld with two
bright prospects from the frosh
crew. Al Ricuitti, who lettered in

freshman basketball, will take

over Pete Suder’s chores at short-
stop, while Suder moves over to
ﬁrst base. .
Howie Mallet will assume the
position. Mallet
originally was listed as a third
baseman, but the Pitt team is
strong at the hot-corner with
captain Jerry Matulevic holding
forth.
» On the following Saturday,
Lewis will take his boys to Slip-
pery Rock for a twin-bill with
the Rockets. He plans to utilize
Frank Ignaczak, Lauren Guthrie

~ or Bill Shay on the mound. Plans

 

call for Mike Supsura, sophomore
catcher, roosting over home plate
in one of the games.

Five Cindermen to Run Three Relays

~ BY JIIVI O'BRIEN

«. Pitt may send a track squad to the annual Penn Relays

sending the cindermen, and the latter don’t seem too con-
cerned aside from the aesthetic rewards of seeing the scenery

of proposed sprint_ medley and

the idea, “Ah, I hate those Penn
Relays. It’s like “Animal Farm.”
They just put you in a cage; then
they let you out on the track.”
Everyone involved in the in-
formal debate concerning the
pros and cons of entering the
mammoth meet. agreed on one
point Bill Hinchberger. “He has
to run a 1:50 half mile,” someone
conﬁded, “but you know we
shouldn’t depend on that.”

According to the popular senti- .

ment, track buffs in this .. area

shouldn’t even depend on Pitt’s

Today’s final session of spring
practice will be the last chance
for some supposed regulars on
the Panther grid team to prove
that their loss in Saturday's in-

“tra—squad game to a team made
up of second stringers and lesser
lights, was all a mistake. ‘

The Blue team had ten letter-
men in their lineup as opposed
to the squad of" three letter win-

by the Whites.
’ The eleventh man on the White
team was the man that made the
difference. He was John Kuprok,

dents. They ask questions I can't answer. They
write essays I don’t understand. They use com-
plicated words that I've never heard before.
How can I possibly hope to win the respect of
students who are more learned than l am?
Professor

DEAR PROFESSOR: I always maintain that noth-
ing impresses a troublesome student like the
sharp slap of a ruler across his outstretched
palm.
