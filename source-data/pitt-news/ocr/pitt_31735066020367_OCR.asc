Forbes Field ...when Oakland hadthe‘Bucs’

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

. ANS WHO PASSED
F through the turnstiles at
Forbes Field discovered some-
thing long since lossed to an archi-
tecture of plastic and concrete -— a
baseball stadium’s charm.

A sense of intimacyjoined big lea-
guers and their fans in a setting
marked by long strings of ivy that
hung tight to the outfield wall and a
background of tall trees.

.. The sounds and smells ofanother
( ..l...~aseball season mixed with the ser-
I--"“ty and culture of Oakland l_and-
grks — Schenley Hotel, Carnegie
lstitute, Masonic Temple, Pitts-
_.:urgh Athletic Association, Phipps

 Conservatory and the Cathedral of

Learning. I

On the field, the likes of Ralph
Kiner and the Waner brothers, “Big
Poison” and “Little. Poison,” Paul
and Lloyd created an aura all their
Own.

But after the Pirates defeated the
Chicago Cu_bs in a doubleheader on
June 28, 1970, the charm went the
way of a demolition team.

Fourteen years later there stands a

portion of the outfield wall — the‘

famous wall that Bill Mazeroski
built. Homeplate lies protected
under glass in the Forbes Quadran-

gle, and the infield is now home to a I

faceless Mervis Hall.

' , The ballpark is gone, but the ball-

players and their memories linger.
Forrest “Smokey” Burgess cher-

ishes the friendships-he struck while-

catching for the Pirates from l954—
64. ‘ ' ‘
“I, really enjoyed playing’ theiie,”
=s'aidBurgess, now a hitting instruc-
tor for the Atlanta Braves’farm club
in Pulaski, Va. “The park never dis-
tanced itself from the fans. If you
wanted to speak to someone, you

      
           
           
   

___________ ......‘;___.__

 

could. There was a real camaraderie
then.”

“I remember the fans were so
close,” Pirate second baseman Bill
Mazeroski said. “If you swore at an
umpire, they heard you. You’d turn
to see their faces and they knew what
you were going through — as ifthey
were playing the game. 1 can still
picture Forbes Field and everything
about it. People miss the together-
ness fans had. It was a friendly
atmosphere.”

It was Mazeroski who gave
Forbes Field its. greatest -lasting
memory- In the l960 World Series,
his home run off New York Yankee
pitcher_ Ralph Terry in the ninth
inning gave the Pirates a l0-9'victory
and sent the city into wild
celebration. A

The sights of Yankee leftfielder
Yogi Berra helplessly watching
Mazeroski’s ball fly over the score-
board and Mazeroski rounding
third base with Pirate fans chasing
him are classics.

The dimensions of the park, long
even by today’s standards, had few
equals. Straightaway center was a
staggering 457 feet; the left and right
field foul lines measured 365 and 300
feet, respectively, while right field
had two power alleys of 408 feet and
375 feet.

Pitchers and ‘hitters differed as to ‘

whom the park favored, though one
thing was certain. The infield, des-
cribed by longtime Pirate broadcas-
ter Bob Prince as “alabaster

plaster,” could be a pitcher’s,night-
mare and an inf"1elder’s worst enemy.

During the seventh‘ and deciding
game of the l960 World Series,

Pirate ceriterfielder Bill Virdon
smashed a grounder to Yankee
shortstop Tony Kubek. Kubek mis-
played the ball, whichstruck him in
the throat, forcing him to leave the
game.

Mazeroski partially sympathized
with opposing players’ complaints.
“I don’t think they liked it," said‘
“Glue Glove” Mazeroski. “Once you

i get used to it being hard, you get

used to it.”

“You might say it’s similar to
AstroTurf’, but you get a smoother
bounce offthat, whereas you got the
bad hops at Forbes,” said Bob
Friend, a righthander who played
there for 15 years. “Pitchers com-
plained, while the hitters delighted
in it.” -

Mazeroski’s double play partner
for eight years, Dick Groat,
wouldn’t call the infield hard rock.
“It was a quick, good infield to hit
on,” the former shortstop said.

Beyond the infield, Forbes Field
came to be known as a “triple park.”
Homeruns were few, though many
baseballs cleared the fences in l946-
53 during the Greenberg Gardens
era. An l8-foot high screen in left
field narrowed the distance to 330
feet to accomodate power swinger
Hank Greenberg, acquired from
Detroit in 1946. But Pirate manage-
ment was not satisfied with his 25
homeruns and he was released at the
end of the season.

That same year, the Pirates disco-

::;“1,:3:’;.*:.:‘. ‘e;:i:r“r.:;:? 29:; We Put G reat Ca re lntri

one-time Pirate homerun leader fol-
lowed his rookie year total of 23 with
51 homers in 1947. So the Gardens
persevered until Pirate fortunes —
both on the field and in the stands —
started sagging.

“You had to hit the ball 400 some
feet to get a homerun,” said Frankie
Gustine, a sharp middle infielder
here from 1939-48 and later an Oak-

The University of Pittsburgh
and Oakland area have
combined to form one of the
nation’s leading“ centers of
medical research and health
care.

Transplant surgery and
support services provided at the
Presbyterian—University Hospi-

tal have received world-wide"

notoriety. -

Presbyterian was the first
hospital in the country where all
major organs — kidneys, hearts,
livers, heart-lungs and pancreas
— were transplanted.

The
program began in the mid-1960s
as a joint effort with the
University of Pittsburgh School
of Medicine. Today, all staff
physicians are members of Pitt’s
faculty.

Kidney transplants were first
performed in 1964 as an
outgrowth of immunology

I studies. Since then, more than

600 kidneys ; _ have been
transplanted under the direction
of Chief of Urology, Thomas R.
Hakala, M.D.

In l980, Chief of Surgery
Henry T. Bahnson, M.D.
reorganized the hospital’s heart

‘transplant program. To date,

more than 50 hearts have been
transplanted.

ATING ‘AT THE ORIGI-
nal, or rather, the “O," is a lot
like a-first visit to the opera.

You may not enjoy it, but you have
‘to respect the people who do.

Early in the morning, late at night.

— they belly up to the sizzle of
plump hot dogs and the crackle and
pop of fries deep in hot oil.

Crowds of people, all sizes and
sha colors and ages, stuff the
“O‘ stuff themselves.

Sidney Simon and his brother
Bruce opened the Original Hot Dog
Shops, Inc. 24 years ago in a build-
ing once occupied by an auto parts
store. It has been there ever since.

‘I’ve seen a lot of them [competi- '

tors] come and go,” said Simon, sur-
veying his Forbes Avenue empire.

Plenty. But something has kept
Pitt students and Oakland visitors
loyal to the Original.

: Tine“ "Pitt News Orientation issue

On a campus empty of tradition,
the “O dog" has become a legend.

A I978 Pitt graduate headed
straight for the Original this summer
after a six year absence from Pitts-
burgh. The “O" also stands for old
times.

“Why do I come here? ...The
ambience. It’s an original place, and
they make dynamite chili dogs and
the best french fries in Pittsburgh."

When asked if the Original might
become a family tradition some day,
he said, “Absolutely. Of course, I’m
not as young as I used to be. A few
years ago, I could eat two chili dogs
and a tub of fries by myself, but not
anymore.” -

He added, “It looks like a rough
joint from the outside, but it’s really
not.”

Another I978 Pitt graduate,
Steven Sheffler, now a local sales-
man, has seen some of the underside
of Oakland during his visits to the
Original.

“I’ve been coming here since I was
a little kid, and I came here with my

he said. “I’ve seen a lot of drunk

But Sheffler said it’s the food that

brings him back. “They make the

and was taken to several restaurants
in the area, all varying in style and
atmosphere. When asked what res-
taurants he would like to visit again,
he said, “take me back to the

But even the Original has to ﬁght
its “Dirty 0" image. Shefﬂer claims

the nickname is the reason behind
the Original T-shirts, worn by all the

Radio is the sound salvation
Radio is cleaning  the nation
—— “Radio, Radio.

-— Elvis Costello

By Marty Willis
and Todd Erkel

The Pitt News

Pitt’s new radio station, WPTS-
FM / 98.5, officially went on the air
Sunday, but not without some back-
ground noise.

A debate over whether WPTS will
—— or should — be a student-run
station continues despite the assu-
rances of university administrators
that little will change from the days
of WPGH-AM, a student-operated

carrier current station that went off A

the air June 14.

After nearly a decade of discus-
sion, and legal action and a ﬁrst-of-
its-kind decision by the Federal
Communication Commission which
gave the university an educational
station on the commercial dial, Pitt
acquired FCC approval last fall for a
10-watt station capable of reaching a
citywide audience within an ll to
l9-mile radius.

The university administration
responded by changing the makeup
of WPGH’s working staff and its
advisory board, moves which left
some long-time staff members
unsure of their position and wary of
the administration's new presence.
Those same students expressed res-

’iF-'r'iday," August‘- 3  1984

news director was recruited and
hired for the previously student-held

A position.

“We didn’t like the way it was all
thrown at us,” one former WPGH
staff member, who asked not to be
identiﬁed, said.

“We had no warninggon this. We
had no warning that Wilfred was
going to be general manager when
he came to WPGH. We had no idea
he was going to be running the

' show.”

Part of this change was unavoida-
ble, the student said, because of
FCC regulations requiring a
professional-level engineer and
because the university is responsible
for the broadcast license. ,

But the administration “went too
far,” the student argued, claiming
that the reallignment left the top stu-
dent position‘ of station manager
with less real decision-making
power.

K.J. Jones, WPTS station man-
ager and former general manager of
the AM station, firmly denied that;
his position has declined in
importance.

“I'm doing the same duties as] did
when I was general manager.” The
change in his title was just that and
nothing more, Jones said.

“Of course he’s going to say that,”
another former WPGH staff
member said of Jones last week.

“Everyone’s 3 pretty well brain-
washed over there. They all just can-
form and go along with it....It’sjust
the apathetic way people feel up
there. They just don’t care anymore.

V It’s so sickening.

“What? bothers me is that it’s a
student radio station, yet students
have no real voice in the decisions
that really, matter.”

The student cited the decision to
bring in a professional, full-time

s news director as an ‘example of

unforeseen changes that were
handed down to the staff without
discussion. 7

“The biggest concernto the staff is
university interference,” Kurt Wein-
schenker, a WPTS news reporter,
said.

“What worries me personally,”
Weinschenker said, “is that, if we
should investigate something
university-related and it should
happen to tread on some toes, the
university is just going to clamp
down completely.”

Director of student activities W.
Andrew Smith, Tremblay’s super-
ior, strongly denied that the admin-
istration might consider meddling

with the station's news coverage, for

whatever reason.
He added that any altering of the
news “wouldsamount to an_unjustifi-

able breach of journalistic ethics.” “

“There is no reason at all to even
consider the fact that [news director]
Mary Doorley’s position is to alter
the news to make the University of
Pittsburgh look good.”

When asked what the administra-
tion’s role in the life of the newborn
station will be, assistant vice chan-
cellor for student affairs Dennis
Donham said, “We have a role,
because it’s through the FCC and it’s
a mandated kind of trust...and that
really means creative involvement.

’It doesn’t mean control, not of day-

to-day decisions.”
Smith explained last Wednesday

that all internal station decisions are V

being made by Tremblay, Jones and
their staff members. Neither he nor
any other administrator above
Tremblay participates‘. in day-to-day
decision, Smith said.

Smith did, however, admit that,
“Ultimately, I’m in charge of the
station.”

Of Smith's role-in the station,‘
Donham said, “It’ll have his ﬂavor
to some degree. He sets expectations
and he sets them high.

“Beyond that, I think there’s a
very clear, open and honestagenda

mendous drive for most people. And

the ball wasn’t very lively then. I hit a V

homer my first month with the
Pirates. lt was late in the game, and I

thought manager Frankie Frisch_

was going to get a pinch hitter for
me. Then he pulled me aside and
said, ,‘No, you‘re batting. See that
scoreboard [left field]? Hit it over
that.’ Sure enough. I’ll be damned if
I didn’t."

-A larger hitting spectacle
occurred May 25, 1935, when Babe
Ru'th sent three pitches into obliv-
ion. Playing out his career with the
Boston Braves, Ruth connected for
a final blast (giving him the long-
standing 7l4 mark) that was thefirst
to clear the 86-foot high right field
roof. An addition in that area had
been built in 1925. Only 17 other
balls had cleared the shed, including
seven hit by all-time Pirate homerun
leader Willie Stargell.

Original Pirate owner Barney
Dreyfuss made sure the outfield was

‘spacious, to avoid what he termed

“cheap homeruns.” Dreyfuss, who
needed a bigger ballyard than the
Northside’s,_Exposition Park, found
Oakland to his liking since he antici-
pated Pittsburghers moving more
toward the east. _‘
Also, he liked the'Schenley area

June 30 of that same year. It con-
tinued until June 28, I970 — 61

fast.

Dreyfuss eventually sold the park
to his son-in-law before Pitt bought
the property in I958.

“It was probably a case of taking

cial. I'd be lying if I said it was spe-
cial when they started building
stadiums. And nobody was going
around saying we should play all the
games in Forbes Field.'The trend
was for new stadiums. That’s all you

problems...."

Feeney insists he's a nonbeliever
in the old parks but said of Forbes‘
inevitable demolition, “Everyone

V Clemente made Forbes his
window to the world. Numerous
times Clemente would dazzle
spectators, picking , off
baserunners who turned ﬁrst
base too widely or who foolishly
tried to outdash his riﬂe throws
to the plate. Playingfrom 1955,
Clemente held Pirate records for
games played, at-bats, hits,
singles and total bases before his
untimely death in 1972.
Of Clemente, Burgess said,
‘.‘You had _to play a standard

outﬁeld. Nobody played it like
Clemente. Clemente studied the
game and got out there everyday
early. He had all the talent in the
world. If they think of Forbes
Field, they have to think of
Clemente. People sure do.”

I No one ever pitched ano-hitter,

four outs of making history June
14, 1968, before Houston Astro

Forbes Field, though Dreyfuss
donated space for War Savings

that Iron City and Duquesne

Forbes also played home to the

The Panthers’ venerable Pop
Warner coached the 1915-18

at Forbes Field. And in a

' AKE A‘ LOOK AROUND. By the time you graduate, the
University of Pittsburgh will be a very different place. It may
look pretty much the same, but change will have occurred.
Pitt is expanding, quickly gaining a reputation as a highly-
ranked educational and research institution and attracting approx-
imately $70 million insponsor research from government and

industry.

Behind the dollars and the decisions are the people who inﬂu-
ence the direction this university will take. They come from diverse _

decide the future of this university. Your future.

Their days are spent discussing a world of long-term planning

and cost-effective decision making’.

It is a world alien to most students, but one that affects all

‘students because the priorities held by these chosen few may soon

become xhe priorities of this university. Your university.

Westingh-:>use Corporation Chair-
man of the Board and Chief Executive
Robert E. Kirby said he believes Pitt’s
objective shouldbe to keep up with the
times and the changing demands of
industry. Any change in priorities, said
the Chairman of Pitt’s Board of Trus-
tees, must meet these future conditions.

Kirby has experienced risk-taking
and planning for future demands as a
integral part of his career in industry. In
his 37-year career at Westinghouse, he
has done much to make it America’s
34th largest corporation; he established
the controls and ﬁnacial conservatism
that took the corporation out-of hard
times. ”

His roots, however, are a combina-
tion of the Iowa heartland and an urban
education. Kirby graduated with a

chemical engineering degree from Penn .
StateUniversity. During World War II, ’

the US. Navy selected him to study
electrical engineering and radar tech-
nology at Princeton, Massachusettes

‘and Bell Laboratories. After 1946,

, Kirby began his long career with

4-Cc-‘.;'.,,¢

Westinghouse.

Kirby had served in several executive
positions, including president of West-
inghouse’s Industry and Defense Com-
pany, before being named vice
chairman in charge of operations in

' . 1974. According .to biographical infor-

mation, his election to Chairman of the
Board in 1975 followed long legal fight
between Westinghouse and utility com-
panies ‘over the supply of uranium.
Westinghouse was contracted to supply
companies with about 65 million
pounds of uranium at far less than the
going price ;corr’ipanies refused to rene-
gotiate the contracts and later sued.
Kirby was Chairman of the Board and
Chief Executive until his retirement in
December 1983.

Discussing Pitt’s future and the
future of the freshman class, Kirby said
Pitt should plan to meet the needs of
industry and the military, though he did

. not downplay the role of a humanities
. education.

“It (Pitt) has to decide how many
(students) to train in each of the individ-
ual sciences—you can't predict how
many will be needed...,” he said.

P_ On state interest in higher education,

.he said too many people have concluded

that plenty of high paying jobs can be
had without further education. “With

v_ the change in the economy and the

reduction in ...blue collar jobs,” Kirby

-explained, “more people should con-

sider attending institutes of higher
learning and the ‘university has to
emphasize what is important and useful

Kirby said he is particularly pleased
with the “great strides in government

sponsored research andtheir

contributions.

“Problems the U.S. faces in the future ,

are problems of international coopera-
tion and understanding,” Kirby said,
adding thatpresent conditions of the
steel industry demonstrate this point.
“Government and industry (research)
are a very important ingredient in main-
taining the quality of teaching.”

Kirby said government or military
research is seen as a challenge by the
professor or graduate student— enough
of a challenge that he will reject higher
paying jobs in private industry in favor
of the more interesting research.

“Young people today have an excel-
lent opportunity to be on the cutting
edge of technological developments,"
Kirby -said. if

Pitt’s School of Engineering headed
by Dean Max‘Wi1liams may soon find
itself in that position. Freshman enter-
ing the school will find it well equiped to
train them , according 'to Dr. Paul

McCormick, Director of freshman_

engineering programs.

Instructors in the school spend much
of their time teaching.As a result, there
is not enough time to conduct a lot of
research, according to McCormick

“The school is equipped for it,” he
said. it

Pitt’s facilities include an atom probe H

center made possible through a $1 mil-
lion contribution by United States Steel
corporation, a laser‘laboratory,,and a
new computer system. There is also
much time and effort dedicated to furth-
ering robotics and artificial intelligence
endeavors.

and promote an awareness of careers in
engineering ‘at the high school level,
McCormick said. A special five-year
liberal arts/engineering program has
been created, geared to producing stu--
dents who appreciate humanities and
the hard sciences. I

According to McCormick, much of
the faculty has been able to involve
themselves in research and consultin-
g.Although he stressed he is not in a
position to speak for the entire school,
McCormick said he would like to see
Pitt do more research. Currently, high
student enrollment of about 400 stu-
dents prevents this.

Williams could not be reached to
comment on the university’s possible
directions and priorities, but submitted
the following statement.

“I regard myself...as an academic-

person first. I am a different

sion looks strong in light of rapidly.

developing technological needs of our
society....As a result, our School of
Engineering enrollment, which has been
at‘ maximum capapcity for several
years, has strained our faculty, staff ,
equipment and space resources. Our
current high student-faculty ratio, for
example, while within reasonable limits
for effective teaching, alone has, how-
ever, upset the desired balance between
the teaching portion and the research
and public service components of our
overall mission...‘ Nevertheless, the
present_ sustained pressure from the
demand side as well as the projections
for continuing near term technical
needs are causing us to look for innova-
tive ways to maintain or systematically
decrease the student-faculty ratio in

order to gain a better balance of teach- ’

ing, research, and public service which
is essential....” i i '
Williams has extensive professional
and academic experience in areas
attractive to research. His main

research_activities have been concen-

trated in the field of general materials
behavior and structural mechanics and
design. ‘

He has served on many governmental
technical advisory committees includ-
ing that National Aeronautics, and
Space Agency (NASA). He has also
served as an associate member of the
Defense Science Board and has been a
consultant for the Department of
Defense and a technical advisor to the

Department of State. Williams cur-

rently serves as a consultant in fracture

mechanics;static dynamic and thermal,
stress analysis; aircraft, missile and

rocket design. In addition to the govern-
ment, he is a consultant for various air-
craft, missile, and metal industries.

His education ranges from a doctoral

I , degree from California Institute of
Technology to on-the-job experience as
e a test flight engineer and captain in the

United States Airforce from 1943-1946.

Attracting research, however, is only
one of Pitt’s concerns for the future and
Pitt Senior Vice Chancellor Dr. Jack
Freeman said he is more concerned
about the management of resources.

“I’m optimistic,” Freeman said, “but

ahead to our future.”

The future, according to Freeman,
should concentrate, but not exclusively,
on furthering ties between industry and
government and higher education.

“We have a healthy relationship with
the corporations,” he said. “... and the
goverment-university—corporate ties
need to be strengthened.” He’ said Pitt

added Pitt has “strong incentives to
attract this.

Freeman has served the university for
over 16 years and was appointed to his
present position in 1979. In this "role ‘, he
serves as chief administrative, financia-
l,and planning officer for Pitt. His prin-
cipal responsibility is the management

planningand policy analysis.
Before coming to Pitt, Freeman

’ /

served as Assistant to the Deputy

Undersecretary of the Air Force for
International Affairs and Assistant

Professor of Political Science at the"

United States Air Force Academy.
“My interests and approach to man-

agement”, Freeman said,"have hope-,

fully been shaped positively [by l3 years

experience in the military]. , ;

Pitt is highly competative in attract-
ing federal research dollars to conduct
research in the hard and social
sciences—having received approxi-
mately $60 million in federal research
contracts, Freeman said‘. Humanities,
he added, does not attract a substantial
amount of research interest because-
,though also competative, is not attrac-
tive to government or industry.

Pitt’s:applied research in" the social‘
sciences is, however, is attracting more
attention and helping Pitt and its Grad-
uate School of Public and International
Affairs to build an impressive track
record solving practical /government
problems.

Associate Dean of GSPIA Dr. Wil-
liam Dunn said the increased amount of
time, energy and attention given to
social science applied research is a
recent development; Currently, GSPIA
is working on several projects and pro-
grams with the State legislature.

One is an Exxon funded program
establishing a partnership between the
university and the legislature for the
purpose of researching and answering
specific questions posed by govern-
ment, according to Dunn. He said illus-
trative questions include policy issues
such as legislative intiatives to protect
the environment and the human servi-
ces agenda for Pennsylvania in the
l980’s.

Such questions, Dunn added,are
important since Pennsylvania is on the
receiving end of a steadily declining dol-
lar ﬂow due to federal cut backs.

Another project planned is a cooper-
ative effort between the school, Public
Television station WQED and the State
House of Representatives. A series of
continuing teleconferences would be
scheduled to address major policy issues

A such as the potential for advanced tech-

nology to improve the state’s sagging
economy, Dunn said.

These projects are more “illustrative
of Pitt’s potential,” Dunn explained
comparing them to the unclassiﬁed
research papers Pitt is considering after
discussions with U.S. Air Force officials
last May.

“Once.the fall term begins,” Dunn
said, “the question will be put back on
the agenda.” , _ ,

. «The. question whether Pitt would

“Our current his student-faculty
ratio...has upset the balance bew-

ponents of our overall mission. ”

—Dr. Max Williams

policy research papers began a “media

exaggeration," according to Pitt‘

administrators.

“The Pitttsburgh Papers,” as dubbed
by one university administrator would
concentrate on broad issues. In a May2
article in The Pitt News, Acting GSPIA
Dean Dr. Leon Haley said the Air Force
listed some of the kinds of topics in
which they were interested, “topics of
immediate international importance to
the United States in terms of strategic
policy considerations.”

Research topics included the Middle

East and Syria, Mexico, and the Soviet

Union and Yugoslavia.

discussions between Pitt and the Air’
Force on research papers, which could
bring in $300,000, attracted national
media attention after General .Iames‘C.
Pfautz, a former collegue of Pitt senior
research associate “Harold Hitchens,
inquired about Pitt’s capabilities to con-
duct the needed research. Hitchens said
in a~_lat'er\interview that Pfautz knew of
his qualiﬁcations because they had‘
worked together and Pfautz knew of

_ Pitt’s research accomplishments- Itywas

on the basis of this that Pfautz and the
Air Force came to believe Pitt was qual-
iﬁed to carry out the proposed research.

Research requested by the person or

government agency with the problem, .

or user-research, according to Dunn,

can further enhance the development of -

social science theory. It's something Pitt
can do, can do well, and ought to do
more of, he said. -

“GSPIA- has done some 20 policy

issue papers for the Commonwealth in
the last 2 years,” Dunn said, “ but Pitt
hasn’t developed much of a [applied
research] track record.”

Applied research, accoriding to
Dunn, must answer practical questions
with timeliness and relavance. I

“People on the outside, outside of the
universities, have no reason to trust uni-
versities or believe we can provide
answers to their problems without it,”he
said. “We have to keep moving and
show we have a contribution to make.”

Dunn added Pitt has an “A plus and
fruitful” relationship with the State
House of Representatives. _

Pitt can also attract more research
and build a better track ‘record on the

strength of its faculty . 

Other priorities for Pitt’s social

science departments and GSPIA should -

be to attract and conduct more applied
research, according to Dunn. This

approach is compatible with the aims of '

university research, Dunn said. He
added the university only does open and
impartial research. '

“We need to address more practical I

problems and focus on user-research.”
Another area Pitt needs to address

with respect to the social" scienceseis  I

ethics and philosphy, according to

I Dunn. “Our record there is miserable. :

“We need to concentrate more on the
philosophical and ethical aspects of the

 problems in our problem,-solving,”_ _. ,  _.

that it’s going to be\a student-run

are very excited about the station.
Students have played extremely

“There's too much investment

hours talking about how he likes to
suck cock. And that’s fine and
dandy, but...there are a lot of stu-
dents who don’t like that kind of
music. We want to project a decent
image for the university.”

Referring once more to the FCC,
Donham said, “A lot of careful
negotiations had to go on~—not
pleading, but we really had to state a
good case that the university is com-
mitted to running with this....

Smith questioned Donham’s
assertion that WPTS will have his
“flavor.” At ’

“That’s a personal observation of
his, but he has not worked with
WPTS. The station will have no fla-
vor of Andy Smith. l’ve really had
nothing to do with determiningthe
program format or the choice of
music or news format.”

It-is Smith, however, who can ulti-
mately\_determine the identities of
future student station managers,
Tremblay said last Thursday. But
Tremblay emphasized that both he,
as general manager, and the newly-
formed 10-member WPTS-FM-
Advisory Board will deliver care-
fully considered recommendations
to Smith on student appointments.

~ So long as the board members,

one of whom is Tremblay, agree on ~

who should be station manager each
year, Smith will approve their
recommended choice, Tremblay
said.

“There should be no problems in
terms of having to make a difficult
decision,” he said, adding, “That’s in
theory.

“I've found that generally you can
work out a consensus. There’s

always the possibility that you can’t, '

of course, Tremblay said, explaining
that he would have more direct input
in the decision of his boss, Smith, in
such a case.

Despite the concern over admin-
strative control, the attitude of the
WPTS staff remained optimistic one
.week before the ribbon cutting.

-“Before, nobody really cared
about the station," Weinschenker
said. “The attitude used to be, ‘Stick
them in their back room and let
them do what they want—that’s it.”

— He said that a more professional
and enjoyable atmosphere now
exists at the station, located on the
William Pitt Union’s fourth ﬂoor.

Earlier this summer, Pitt student

Lisa LaValle was the news director '

of WPGH. Now, she is a reporter in
the WPTS news department headed
by Doorley. She had‘ initially
expressed disappointment with the

changes taking .place in the depart- ~

ment and in almost every aspect of
radio at Pitt.

“Yes, at first I was apprehensive,”
she said. “But I think the choices of

I’m very excited.” I

Mary Daigle, the music director
at WPGH last winter, is adapting to
a her new role as a news and sports
reporter, while continuing to fill a
regular air shift as a disc jockey.

“I was away all summer, and I
heard horror stories,” Daigle said. “I
didn’t know what to expect. When I
first walked in there, there wasva

to that. _

“But when I went home that night,
I was so psyched up. So much work
had been done alltsummer, and it
was the students like K.J. and Chris

who had done all that. And Lee

with the music department.”

Forbes  
Field
ﬂashback

continued from page nine

the last couple have been amazing. I
don’t know why this is.”

Dick Groat might. Now co-owner
of Champion Lakes Golf Club in
Latrobe, Pa. and radio commenta-
tor for Pitt basketball games, Groat
always dreamed of playing in the
park he invariably attended as a
youngster. .

“My father took me to the games
and I can remember often-times sit-
ting in the bleachers along the first
base line,” Groat said. “Today, it’s-
what people call a lack of intimacy.
If you were part ofthe game, you felt
a closeness to the players. Now all
the players are down there. They
know stadiums are so far removed ‘
[from the fans].”

Today‘s aging players understand
the demolition of Forbes Field in
terms of making way for innovation
but vividly recall the Oakland con-
fines that provided for their glory
days. .

Gustine provided a home for
many Forbes Field memories at his
Forbes Avenue tavern which opened
in 1952. “Frankie Gustine’s” was
adorned with various baseball relics,
including hardened catchers’ mitts
and autographed pictures.

The place often overflowed with

people after ballgames with patrons

talking baseball over a beer or two.
Players might have dropped by not
only there but at surrounding bars,

. too. Gustineeven had an entire Cin-

cinnati club in his place one night
long ago.

“Afterward you could meet in the
bars around the area and have a
good time,” Mazeroski said. “Play-
ers got around a lot more, too, stop-
ping off at the bars to have a beer
and talk baseball.”

Gustine’s went the way of wooden
benches last year when a second
retirement became inevitable. -“That
was the last remembrance of Forbes
Field," Gustine, 64, said. “It was like
a museum. I had mixed emotions
about leaving it." -

Friend, who still holds team stri-
keout and innings-pitched records,
expressed similar thoughts about
Forbes Field. “I was a little upset,
but those things happen. It had as
much tradition and charm as any
park in the National League. Talk to
some fans who attended thenight
games or Sunday doubleheaders.
They still tal_k about it as if it were
yesterday.”

Forbes Field would have been 75
years old this year. There is a wall
‘there to prove it.

that figure soars on the weekends.

“It depends on the circumstan-
ces,” he said, “what time of year, etc.
The fall is usually the peak.”

One big attraction may be the
Original’s beer supply.

“We serve more beer than any
other bar in the city, and this is
according to the distributors,"
Simon said.

The Original stocks 87 brands of
imported beer and does a hefty take-
out business during the week.
Liquor is served on Sundays only.

Simon believes the liqour attracts
“a hard drinking crowd," and fights
occasionally do break out, but
“there are less given our volume than
in other bars.”

CGS student Maureen Lucas
brought her two daughters to the
Original for the first time. “I wasn’t
sure if it was good to bring kids in,”

she admitted. “I haven’t been here in
years, but the prices are good and so
is the food. My husband just loves
coming here.” -

Simon has noticed changes in the
“O” clientele. “The students aren’t as
radical, it's not as rough a crowd.
The kids today are more settled
down and relaxed. They want to
have fun,” he said.

Simon attributes his success in I

part to his family. “There is usually a
' family member here."

His daughter Terry agrees.
“Mainly it’s been _so successful
because there’s so much spirit
behind the counter.”

Simon admitted he has thought

about franchising his business. He '

also hopes one of his children will
take over the Original.

But, according to Terry, “he’ll
always be here; he created it.”

Simon was not convinced.
“Someday, I’lljust come in here and
disappear."

Jennifer Hublitz calls Allen-
town, Pa. home, but she yearns
for the bigger city life. V

“Everyone” says (Pitt) is so
inner city, but it’s very cultural

' and there's a lot of things to do,”

Hublitz said. -

Hublitz, who graduated with a
class of 427 from Parkland High
School, was active in the Key
the Parkland. Athletic
Club and the Leo Club.

The KeyClub devotes itself to
commmunity service and ‘its
members are_ invited based on
superior academicachievement.
As a member, Hublitz helped
organize the Special Olympics
and raise money for Multiple
Sclerosis and the poor. s 6‘

Hublitz said she doubts she

would join any service organiza- ,

tions at Pitt in her first term. -
“I probably won’t be joining
any clubs like that [at Pitt],” she
said. “It takes a lot to remain
active.” ‘I '
Hublitz, however, has ‘not
ruled out extracurricular activi-
tes at the university. She has an
interest in joining the student
media, due to her success in Eng-
lish in high school. ’ l . ~'
“I did really well in English
[during high school],” Hublitz
said. “I like to write.“ » '
A visit with relatives in Pitts-
burgh last year helped Hublitz
decide to attend Pitt. During her
stay, ‘she was able to takea close
look at the _school. . '
At first, she was also inter-
ested in_ Chatham College, but
after the tour she decided only to
apply to Pitt. ' _' » * '

Sabo also applied to
Duquesne, but she cited finan-
cial reasons for choosing Pitt.

Sabo will enter .the nursing
program. Already, she has heard
those academic stories that are
passed down‘ from the
upperclassmen. ” .

“I’Ve heard that all freshman
nursing students fail their chem-
istry course,” she said. “One girl
I worked with this school had to

take the course again in summer
school.” I

I Which is probably the reason
why Sabo won't predict straight
A’s in college.

“I’m laying back to see how
my first semester goes,” Sabo
said. “I have to see how hard it is
and how much time it takes”

“If I don’t get the A’s, its no
big deal as long as I try my best.”

Karen Sabo, the pressure has
ended.

Sabo earned valedictorian
honors at Pittsburgh’s Bishop
Boyle High School, graduating
with a 4.0 grade point average
after four years. At times
though, ‘maintaining this aca-
demic excellence was frustrat-
ing.

“I went into my freshman year

in high school first in my class,”

Sabo said. “After the end of my

wanted to be valedictorian.”

“We were fighting each other
for the spot. Most of the timeit
was just one—tenth of a point
which separated us. Everyone
knew where each other was.”

Sabo said she pushed herself
harder to earn top honors, but
the self—motivation did not come
without problems. ‘

“There were times that I got
sick ofschool,” she said. “But my
English teacher, Ms. Harrigan,
helped me out.”

“She told me everyone gets
senioritis and some get it worse
than others. She said not to let it
bother me and not to get upset
about it.”

Despite going to a small high
school-—Sabo’s senior class only
had l36,‘students—Sabo is not
worried about entering a school
with over ,l7,000 undergrad-
uates.

“I don’t- think (it will bother
me),” she said. “It’s no big deal.
Other kids have to do it, so
what.”

“You are on your own either
way.”

There were several reasons
Sabo had for selecting Pitt.

“One factor in my decision
was my familiarity with the cam-
pus,” she said. “My aunt went to
school here. It’s also close to
home and I will be commuting.”

The multi-million dollar joint
project, named the “campus of the
future” by its promoters, envisions
the design and installation of a
university-wide system for voice,
data and video-transmission. This
project will eventually enable the
45,000 students, faculty and admi-
ninstrators here to plug into the
_world’s first integrated fiber optics
communications system and receive
information by voice, video or com-
puter data.

regional campuses at the touch of a
computer keyboard.

The fiber optics system differs
from other systems, such as copper
wiring and coaxial cables used by
cable companies, because ofthe cap-
ability of fiber optics to carry voice,
video and computer data.

By carrying all three aspects of
information retrieval on one system,
the need for costly seperate systems
is eliminated. The system could save
as much as $20 million in terms of
cost reductions and productivity
increases over the next few years,
according to administrators.

The cost of the project has been
estimated between $3.5 and $8 mil-

lion dollars. With the addition of

equipment such as computer termi-
nals, the cost could possibly double.

The savings in cost reductions,
productivity increases, improved
services and academic opportunities

~, could reach $20 million, according
' to administrators.

Most ofthe wiring should be com-
pleted by the end ofthis year, but the
entire system may take awhile to be
completed due to the constant inno-
vations in computer technology.

Pittmeets
tough foes
in 1984

The Pitt football team has some

high expectations for the season that
begins tomorrow at Pitt Stadium.

i There is talk of a national cham-
pionship, or at least a major bowl
bid.

Coach Foge Fazio has found the
standards established by his prede-
cessors to be tough enough, but this
season’s schedule may be his most
rigid challenge yet.

Brigham Young

Pitt opens the season at home
tomorrow afternoon. It will be the
first meeting between Brigham
Young and the Panthers.

The Cougars are coming off a
superb season in which the team fin-
ished in the Top 10 with a record of
l_l-l,_inqluding ll straight wins after
a season-opening loss to Baylor, 40-
36.

However, the Holiday Bowl
champions lost All-America quar-
terback Steve Young to graduation.
Thus, Pitt will face a signal caller
with no game experience.

Brigham Young has a history of
outstanding quarterbacks, though.
The last four quarterbacks that have
directed the Cougar offenses have
gone on to‘professional football as
starters: Gifford Neilson (Houston
Oilers), Marc Wilson (Los Angeles
Raiders), Jim McMahon (Chicago
Bears) and Young (Los Angeles
Express). The new kid in the hot
seat is junior Robbie Bosco (6-3,

I88). He should get plenty of help
from All-America candidate Glen
Kozlowski, a junior wide receiver
who has 58 receptions for 908 yards
to his credit.

On defense, the team returns three

of the starting four linebackers from

seven rows above the Super
. Turf surface upon which he
will soon challenge a long stand-
ing precedent. His 6-foot-5, 285-
pound body robs the Pitt
Stadium sun worshippers oftheir
ultraviolet rays, but who’s to
question the first offensive line-
man in 49 years to contend for
the Heisman Trophy?

His reviews are as customized
as his size 54 sportcoats. “He’s as
good as they come and better
than 99 percent of them,” said
Pittsburgh Maulers coach Hank

Bullough. One opponent,
265-pound Eric Dorsey of Notre
Dame, said that “going up

against Bill Fralic is like playing
against a god.”

Even divine intervention might
not be enough to win over the
Heisman electorate, which revels
in offensive statistics other than
holding-penalties per game. In
response, the Pitt Sports Infor-
mation Office has devised the
pancake equation — one Fralic
Vote for every time he ﬂattens
somebody.

The arguments will continue
throughout the season, which
starts tomorrow afternoon at Pitt
Stadium against Brigham
Young; the question will persist:

Can an offensive tackle win the
Heisman Trophy?

Bill Fralic seems to think so.

- E] E] E] \

IQ: Do you want to win the
Heisman Trophy?

A: Yeah. I would like to win it.
Q: Why?

A: Because it’s there. I guess it
signifies being the best football
player in college football -and I
would like to be recognized as
that. I feel I have a chance to be. I
feel ifl go out and play like I am
capable, I’ll be deserving of
winning it. .

Whether I will or not, that
remains to be seen. But ifl go out
and improve like I’ve improved
in three years, then I feel like,
well, if somebody else wins I
should have won just as easily.

There are maybe 12 games to
be played, so Ijust have to go out
there and see what happens.

Q: Does it bother you that no
other lineman has ever won?

" A: No. Not really. I don’t care.

Q: What do you think you
have to do, as a lineman, to win?

A: I don’t know. I can go out
and have a great year next year
and nobody will ever notice.
Well, they will notice, but it’s
something that I don’t really
worry about.

Q: Is the Heisman one of your

‘priorities this season?

A: The only priorities 1 got this
year are to go out and improve
over last year, play well and win.
Those are the only things I have
any control over.

Q: How about theiLombardi

’- V and Outland Trophpies?

 

Wha doe

avnnvvvvas/an Luuvbv

    

ANYTHING HE WANTS

[BY JOE AZEFF

A: I don’t even worry about
those. They are awards, and I
'don’t really worry about awards.
I worry about what I have
control over. I have no control
over the Lombardi or the
Outland Trophy. I don’t know
what the hell some sportswriter
in East. Kabumf-ck is gonna
write about or who he’s gonna
vote for. I imagine there’s a lot of
guys that vote because they like
this guy because he’s from the
school they like.

Sh-t, it’s all political and so are
a lot of things, but it’s not
political how I go out and play
and that’s what makes me happy
or unhappy, ifl play well or not.

Q: What do you think of the
way Pitt is promoting you?

A: That’s not my job.
Whatever they ask me to do I try
to do. I’ll bend over backwards to
do it, but I don’t really worry
about what they plan for me to
do and I never tell them to do this
and that because it’s my job. I
don’t know whatgoesinto it.’

Q: Do you like the publicity?

A: I could take it or leave it. I
don’t get off on it or anything. It’s
nice every now and then, but, I
don’t know, I was in high school
and I seen all that stuff. It’s nice
at first but you can imagine howl
feel. Like, I seen The Sporting
News and I was looking for Play-
boy or something and I’d see

myself. I didn’t go “Hey, hey!” It

didn’t do much for me.-

_Q: Do you ever wish. that’

people would leave you alone?
A: Yeah. Most of the time.

Q: For example, interviews
like this one?

A: No. When I’m sitting here I
don’t hate doing this, but if I’m
finishing up lifting and I’m
walking out of the stadium, I’d
just as soon keep walking" to my
car and go out and do-what I was
going to do. But if I get stopped,
I’ll do it. It doesn’t kill me.

Q: -Do you consider it your
. \ '

1 _ , \

 

obligation since you play for Pitt?

and receive a scholarship?

A: Not because of that. But if
you ask me to do it then I’ll do it.
It’s not that I’m obligated to do
anything like that, I don’t think.
But if somebody asks to do a
story on me then I’ll say, it must
be something to you to walk up
here and do something so I feel I
owe it to that somebody, just ‘to
be a decent human being.

Q: Is there a lot of pressure on
you‘? r  

A: Yes, there is, but I feel that
all the pressure. that anyone feels
is put on by himself. It’s all how
-you handle things. I guess if I

‘ worried a lot about the Heisman

Trophy and this and that then
maybe I would feel it but I don’t
feel any different than I did last

. year or the year before.

AQ: Certainly things have
changed since you graduated

from Penn Hills High School. _

A: Maybe things have changed
but I don’t think I’ve changed. I
don’t really let it bother me. I just

' gotta go out and play football as

good as I can, just like everyone
else on the team. Then things will
take care of .themselves.

Q: Last year, Anson Mount of
Playboy magazine wrote that:
Bill Fralie could be the best
offensive lineman of all-time, a
comment which has been
repeated by many sportswriters,
football coaches and players ever
since.

Do you think you can be the
best offensive lineman of all
time? i

A: If I don’t f-ck up, I don’t see
why I shouldn’t be. Will I? I don’t
know, that remains to be seen. I
got a hell of a lot to prove before I
can say that. At this stage where I
am now, Idon’t think anybody
else has done better, but then
again I haven’t seen everybody. ’

I don’t see‘ no reason, well, I
still have to play at least ten more
yearsbefore I can say that. But as

far ascollege is concerned, if I go .

out and have the kind of year that
I’m capable of this year, I think‘
I’ll be as good or better than

' everyone else up to that time.

I don’t know. Everybody has
their opinion about everything
but, what the hell, all “I can worry
about is myself," not what
everybody else is gonna worry
about . '

Q: Are there any professional

‘ linemen that you admire?

A: There’s not really anybody,

but I don’t really get to watch

that much. I’m tied up during the
season with the team. When I’m

away from here I don’t really like '

to watch football.

Q: How do you get away from

‘football?

A:_ I’m never really away from
it. Even when I’m away from it -I_
think about it. I like to go play
golf and go f-ck girlsand get

'- drunk. If you can put that in
 there, put that in there. I don’t.
’ care. '

When I’m in school, that gets
me away from football.

‘Q: Does playing football-

conflict with your studies?

A:‘ Yeah, tremendously.’ It’s
hard to change from stuff that’s
so important to you all day, or
most of the day, then go and do
something else that’s supposed to

 be of equal importance or more
' importance. It’s tough during

football. _
It’s not real tough to go to

during the season it’s real tough.

Q: Do you think /you will get

i"you.r degree?

A: I’d like to. 111 get it. Will]
get it on time? Well, I’ve got a

decent chance of getting it on

time. I’m six credits behind now

I V but I can make them up this year. '
4 Hopefully.

 

after the season but_

 

A: Economics '
communications;

Q: Do you want to ‘get into
something along those lines or go
right into professional football?

A: I want to go right into pro
football. Hopefully I’ll do well
enough there that I can do what I
want to do after that.

Q: Have you given any thought
to the United States Football
League? -

A: A little. I’d play there if
everything was right. If I felt it

and _.

 

  Q: Back to the moneyijlisi it
and do you ﬁnd,

important
yourself thinking about it a lot?

A: No, but I guess it will be
important. I guess it has to be. I’d
be stupid not to think about it.
It’s not important but it is
important. It’s hard to say.

As long as I - have enough
money to do what I want to do,
then fine. I’m not _out to make as
much money as I can. I’d like
money to do things I like to do
and do things for people that I’d
like to do them for.

Q:‘What kind of things?

\.

“Football has been mostly what I ive been concerned
about over the last ten years, then I got to the point where

everybody’s asking me questions.”

I -19:11 Fralic

would be ‘better for me to play
there than in the NFL, I’d do it.

Q: What would make it better?
Money? ' '

A: I guess the money would
have to be a lot better. But when I
say the money, I don’t know what

difference would make me goto’

the USFL instead of the NFL.

Q: What is it like to be in your

‘ position? So many people would

give you millionsof dollars to
play professional football. -

A: It doesn’t affect me. That’s

A justthe way it is-. It’s been that

way for a . little while, but it
doesn’t really matter or bug me.

Q: It wouldn’t really bug me
either. -

"A: Yeah, it would, at times. It
doesn’t make me feel any better
about myself or _ anything,
though. I don’t think I’m any

better than this person or that

person. Idon’t feel that I’m better
than someone.sitting up in the
stands because they’re clapping

I for me and I’m‘ not clapping for
f'_tl1e.rn_. , .  *  .@

 

_ A: ‘Whatever strikes me that
day. That would be nice to be
able to make someone else happy
with me. i ‘ . .

Q: Any plans» for a new
Corvette or anything?

A: I don’t know. Like I said, I
don’t dream about sh-t like that.
But it would be nice if I wanted to
get something that I could get it.

Q: So football is really what
you think about all the time.

A: Well, I think about that
making everything else in life a
lot easier.‘ I think ‘about the
money and that kind of stuff, if I
can take care of that.

Football has been mostly what .

I've been concerned about over
the "last ten years, and then I got
to this point where everybody’s
asking me questions. I figure,
don’t change now and don’t
worry about all this‘ other sh-t.

Q: How‘ do you think the
Panthers will dogthis season?

A: We're gonna win some

‘games, hopefully most of ,them..
, Hopefully.-all of them, We should: ‘

have a good team; We’ll see -"if

everybody else paid the price this I‘
summer and busted their asses in .
the gym and stuff. If we get lucky, -

and we have to get lucky, well...

Q: How about the seasons
behind you? Are there any games

that stand out from your career 

at Pitt? ‘

A: The Sugar Bowl. I always
think of that when somebody
asks me. That was a fond
memory. The West Virginia
game a-couple years ago when we
were losing 13-0, [but won 16-13
at Pitt Stadium in l982],_ there’s
that. ’

Q: Which linemen were the
toughest?

A: They’re all a challenge,‘

some more than others. I enjoy

playingagainst somebody good.  S
I feel I play better when I have :

something to shoot for like that. I
play against a lot of good guys, I
can’t really single any of them
out. . P

Q: Have you ever taken
steroids?‘

I A: No.

Q: What do you thi-nk'of the
drug testing Pitt is introducing at
Fall camp? '

A: It’s good. I think it will shut
the critics up. I think it’s time
they shut up all the assh.-les‘ out
there who don’t know what "the
hell they’re talking about.

Q: So Pitt
anything to hide?

doesn’t have

A: Yeah. There will always be
people just trying to cut you
down. This is one lessthing they
can cut on, after the testing.

. Q: Steroids or not, you’re still P
quite

large. Were you this
massive when you came to Pitt?

A: No, I was about 265 or 270.
I‘ haven’t really gotten that much
bigger since I came here. I don’t
know how my measurements
have changed, but 15 pounds to
me isn’t a whole lot of weight.
Fifteen pounds would show a lot
more on someone else than they
would on me.

Q: Where do you find clothes
to fit yourbody?

A: Wherever I can find them,
not really any particular place.
It’s a pain in the ass. I have to get
my good clothes tailored because
I can’t get them anywhere else.

Q: Is it a pain to be as big as
you are?

A: When you’re .looking for

clothes it is.
Q: How about with dating?
A: Sometimes, butinot usually.

Some of them like that,- some of
them don’t. Hopefully the ones.

you see and like, hopefully that’s

the ones that like it.

But it’s not everything, you‘  ‘I
know.-.   « ’

Roger Kingdom running better than ever.

WELCOME FRESHMEN!

PITTSB UR GII’S NE WEST

RA D10 STATION   I

IS LOCATED RIGHTHERE   
ON PITT’S CAMPUS      

By Charlie O'Hara
The Pitt News

Roger Kingdom's “precise goal
for the Olympics [was] to do the best
and make the best effort toward get-
ting the gold medal as I can. I want
to win it for myself and for my
family."

To win the highest honor for a
track and ﬁeld athlete, the Pitt jun-
ior would need to overcome the
speed, power and arrogance of the
world’s top I 10-meter high hurdler,
who has yet to lose a race that he
finished in 1984.

“The gold medal is in my pocket
as far as I'm concerned," said Greg
Foster a week and a half before the
competition in Los Angeles. “If
anyone was going to catch me, it
would have been in the [Olympic]
Trials. Now there is no way I’m
going to lose. I’m on top of the world
as far as hurdling is concerned. I've
proved I’m the best.” .

On August 6 at approximately
6:10 pm at the Los Angeles Cole-
sium, Kingdom's cool. disposition
and ﬂuid stride was just a hair better

than Foster's, at least for 13.20

seconds.

For a brief moment following the
short sprint to international star-
dom, Kingdoms’s didn’t know if it
was true.

With Foster in lane one and King- _

dom in lane eight and the difference
between them only .01 of a second,
no one was sure of who won until the
instant replay appeared on the gia‘nt
television screen above the torch end
of the Coliseum.

-“I thought I came in second,”
Kingdom admitted afterwards. “We
were totally separated. Hecould not
see me when I made a move and I
could not see him. All wehad to do

.was run. All we could do was run.

“I thought he had overtaken me at
the line. When I was» watching the

 PMIveas‘“‘oraeS'aiaS2i lssiie

replay I felt really excited because I
knew even ifl hadn’t wo'n‘~I was-in

the running for the silver medal.-.I,

was happy to have that.”

Foster blew out of the starting
blocks so quickly that he figured. it
was a false start or so he said. King-
dom began with his typical mediocre
to poor start.

“It was a bad thing (for the star-
ter), but on my part it was worse,’I
Foster explained. “I shouldn’t have
eased up. I took off too soon. He
didn't call it back but I still stopped.
It was my stupidity that I stopped.”

“The start was - fair,” Kingdom
said. “Tonie [Campbell of the U.S.]
and I were side-by-side for the first
four hurdles. Then I started a surge.
And when I started that surge, I
overtook Greg.” _

Despite the opportunity to steal

the show and bask in the Olympic’

gold medalist’s spotlight, Kingdom
just coped with successin his usual
manor. ~ I '

I “It means I’m the second- or third-
best hurdler in the world and that
I’m a world-class hurdler,” he said.

_“This is just one race. [Foster] has

won so many big races. Because I
won this race means, I’m the Olym-
pic champ; But it doesn't mean that
I’m better than Greg.”

Foster did speak about Kingdom
after explaining his failure to win the
gold. 0

“Roger ran a great race,” he said.
“He deserves it. He’s a great hurdler.
There are a lot of people who think
I’m going to be bitter and disap-

‘ pointed. But I’m not. I'm as pleased

with the silver medal as I would be
with the gold. It’s a different color;
but it shows that I competed in the

‘ Olympic Games.
“You’re notsupposed to do a lot‘

of things. You’re not supposed to
take second. But mistakes happen. I
am experienced. I am more expe-

rienced than Roger. Bift Ican make '

mistakes just like Roger can and I
made it at the wrong time.”

Right up until the semi-final and

A final heats at the Olympics, King-

dom was worried about his physical
condition. V

In his opening trial on Sunday
August 5, he was running for the
first time in a week having rested his
sore hamstrings. He did win his heat
but the time, 13.53, dimmed hopes
of the gold medal.

“The chances are that we (the
U.S.) can sweep,” he said following
that first sprint. “I had to sit out for
six days [last week], that's why I was
kind of sluggish out there. I felt it a
hair. I was really cautious.

“[Tomorrow], I know what I have
to do, which is get smoother over the
hurdles. I’m glad I got the first one
out of the way. I think that all three
of us (F osterand Campbell) can do
really well.” .

’ Actually two weeks before his
race, Kingdom returned to Pitts-

burgh to move into his new apart- »
. ment. He was, extremely worried

about his‘ hamstrings. _
His coach Elbert ‘Kennedy of the

‘New Image Track Club suggested

that Kingdom visit Sister Elizabeth

' Anderson of the downtown YMCA.’

“Hes went to church and got
saved,” Kennedy said. “Sister And-
erson grabbed his leg and told him
that , ‘Now you are healed.’ We
prayed and she told him that God is
with you. Keep the faith. If you
believe that, you are healed.

“She’s a prophet. She said that he
was gonna win the gold medal. She
told him that. I had witnesses. She
even knew who he was. She went up

. to him and said, ‘You’re Roger
‘Kingdom. You know, Kingdom is a V

name in the Bible.’ "

knee bends and high leg lifts as if the
soreness had never existed.

“He couldn’t do them before,”
Kennedy continued. “I was worried.
I thought he was gonna pull it again.
I couldn’t believe it.”

Since his Olympic triumph, King-
dom went to Europe to run in a ser-
ies of races featuring his
head—to-head dual with Foster.

The series got off to a great start
on Sunday August 19 at the Berlin
Track and Field Championships.
The meet was held at the sight of the
1936 Olympics. The same sight of

7 the last Pitt Olympic gold medal per-

formance, John Woodruff’s 800-
meter performance.

Although Foster warned the
media the day before that he could
barely walk because of a sprained
ankle, he nipped Kingdom by the
width of his skin-tight black, silk
uniform.

Foster ran the fastest time in the

‘ world for 1934 (13.16), while King-'

dom, who trailed by as much as five

yards after the second hurdle, came 1 '

charging over the second ﬁve hur-
dles tonearly miss with a mark of
13.17 — his legal best.

Two nights later they met again,
this time in Zurich, Switzerland. The
race was .01 from being an instant
replay. Both trimmed their times,
Foster again winning (13.15) with
Kingdom right on his tail, 13.16.

In Berlin, Kingdom spoke of the
new, gold medal image that islnow
associated with him.

“I can't go out and change things
now that I won the gold medal,” he
said. “I have to continue doing what
I’m “doing.”

0 O 0

It was the final week in June when
Kingdom qualified for the U.S.
Olympic team after sitting out of the
collegiate track season to train.

He made the team by placing third
(13.36) behind Foster and Camp-
bell. The American trio was favored
to sweep the gold,*silver and bronze
medals, but Finland’s Arto Bryggare
broke through for the bronze behind
Kingdom and Foster.

In the weeks preceding the Olym-
pics Kingdom began to think he had
an outside shot at the gold. '

After all, he won the only race that
Foster raced in and didn't win. In
fact, he beat both Foster and Camp-
bell at the Bruce Jenner Classic in
-early June. H

Although Foster didn’t cross the

‘ finish line, stumbling over the third

hurdle, Kingdom beat Campbell ﬂat

' out. ~

It was the first time he had beaten
Campbell since the Pan-American
Games last August. He also beat
then No. 2 ranked Alberto Casanas
of Cuba. That race put Kingdom on
the international map for the first
time although he had an NCAA
championship to his credit.

On July 22, Kingdom ran his final

- pre-Olympic .race in Sacramento,
CA..

' He blew away’, an international

. field with a superior time of 13.00 -

the third fastest time ever recorded
under any conditions. The win was
measured illegal by 2.6 miles per
houn

“He ran a 13 flat, and he still had
problems,” Kennedy said. “His race
has always depended on the first
hurdle. If he is still in the race after
the first hurdle, then he can run with
anybody.

“I think that he is the fastest guy in
the world between the hurdles, and I
told him that before he went out for
that meet [in Sacramento]. He said
he thought about it for a long time."

Kennedy believes that Kingdom
can break the world record, held by
now San Francisco 49er wide
receiver Renaldo Nehemiah.

Nehemiah certainly believes that
Kingdom has the most talent. He
said it on national television just
before Kingdom’s race" to the
victory.

lt’s open season for college football

By Mary Daigle
and Mark A. Sindler

The Pitt News

This summer, the U. S. Supreme

.. Court ruled in favor of an open

market when it declared the
National Collegiate Athletic Associ-
ation’s college football contracts
invalid on the grounds that exclusive
rights constituted anti-trust.

As a result of the Court’s ruling,
which culminated years of legal bat-
tle initiated by the Universities of
Oklahoma and Georgia, individual
schools are now able to negotiate

' their own television contracts.

' ‘CBS, in a one-year exclusivity
deal, owns the rights to games
involving the Big Ten and Pac-l0

_tic Coast

Conferences. Meanwhile, ATBC had
struck a similar contract with the

College Football Association, a con-

sortium of 63 schools. lncluded are
the major independents and schools
associated with the Big Eight,
Southwest, Western Athletic, Atlan-
and Southeastern
Conferences. ‘

It is still unclear whether a net-
wor will televise games between
schools from the CFA and Big
Ten/Pac-l0.

Cable networks also entered the
picture, seeking to pick up games
not to be televised by ABC or CBS.
WTBS — Ted Turner's Atlanta-
based superstation — and Enter-
tainment and Sports Programming
Network (ES PN)joined the bidding
wars.

The result has been a confusing

array oftelevision packages and talk
of even bigger things for the future.

Pitt, as part of the CFA, has, not
surprisingly, taken advantage ofthe
situation’ and of its position as a
major football draw.

The first twoigames of the I984
season will be televised live. Tomor-
row’s opener against Brigham
Young can be seen on ESPN starting
at 3:40 p.m.. .

ABC has obtained rights to the
Oklahoma game, Sept. I5. Game
time is set for 3:50 p.m.

While ABC is still negotiating for
rightsto the Pitt—Penn State game,
Nov. 24, the major television carrier
of Pitt football games this season
will be Katz Communication, a
major syndicator in the Northeast.

According to Associate Athletic
Director Dean Billick, Katz will tele-

- follows;

Oct. 13 . . . . ..at South Carolina
Oct. 20 . . . . . . . . . . . .. at Miami
~ Oct. 27 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. Navy

All games included in the Katz
sports package will be seen on
WTAE (Channel 4). The home game
kickoff times are set for l2:20 p.m.

Billick’s biggest concern about the
increased TV scheduling is the possi-
ble glut oftelevised college football,
a situation which now confronts col-
lege basketball.

“There could very easily be four to
five live college football games on
Saturday afternoons,” he said.

The increased exposure will likely
effect stadium attendance as fans
opt for the televison set instead of
the bleachers. According tp Pitt
Athletic Director Ed Bozik, the var-
ious television plans can potentially
cut into gate receipts.

“The common wisdom argues
that if you have overexposure, that
detracts from attendance.” Bozik
said. “It certainly has significance
over the long run. Yet another train
of thought says the pros —— take the
Steelers — are overexposed and they
don’t readily suffer.

“But I think there is a difference.
The Steelers were sold out before.
But I think there is a urea! note"?-:1!
[of slipping attendance figures].
which concerns me.”

Such fears are shared by Pitt soci-
ology professor Rollo Turner.

“We can expect a saturation sim-
ilar to that of college basketball,”
said Turner.

“I think we’ll see more of those
teams who are organized enough to
coordinate marketable packages."

According to Turner, the Pitt pro-

grams fit into the “big-time" cate-
gory and he foresees Pitt taking full
advantage of the Supreme Court
ruling. '
‘ “As long as they continue to stay
in the Top 20, they (Pitt) stand to
win big now that they aren't limited
to the number of telecasts they can
air," Turner said.

With the increased recognition,
though, comes less revenue from
individual telecasts.

mand as much as $500,000 by
appearing on regional and national
telecast.

“The money taken in for televising
the games will be’cu‘t in half,” Billick
said “This year, there will be more
games for lesstmoney,”

Bozik said Pitt will lose approxi-
mately $l million dollars in telecast
revenue under the new arrangement. '

However, Billick sees the oppor-
tunity for a financial bonanza, but
said more work is needed to coordi-
nate schedules.

“We are on uncharted waters.
Hopefully next year, we can work
things out even better, because itjust
can't be 10 or I5 teams making the
money.”-

Bozik claims the Supreme Court’s
ruling was “not in everybodys’ inter-
ests," as Pitt would not lose the $l

‘million were it to appear on ESPN
three times and ABC once under
that old plan.

After the ruling the NCAA estab-
lished a committee aimed at provid-
ing a contingency plan. The plan did ,
not pass, though Bozik said it was

similar to the CFA’s.

“It would have involved all the
Division I-A schools, allowing an
open window for syndication,” said
Bozik, who served on that commit-
tee. “Open to all networks, it was
very conservative because it had to
meet all the laws. We didn't want to
jeopardize” the organization
[NCAA] again.” . _

While Division I football schools
try to maintain a happy medium
between increased television recog-
nition and sagging revenue, cable
networks revel over finally getting a
foot in the door.

Said Terry Reed, Katz publicity
director, “We were able to do things .
we were never able to do before.“

“Last year, we got to cover just
one big game [first annual Kickoff 0
Classic between Penn State and
Nebraska], due to NCAA restric-
tions. The ruling has opened up a
whole new horizon of games for us
to cover.” , -

Much of the success cable net-
works like Katz hope to enjoy will
depend on securing rights to schools
with proven drawing power. That
means -not only fans, but commer-
cial sponsorship also .

Buczkowski fights to keep his job

By Joe Zeff
The Pitt News

EDINBORO — B-U-C-Z-K-O-
W-S-K-I.

Imagine the headaches of the
seamstress who must squeeze those
letters onto the back of a football‘
jersey. But not even that compares
to the headaches Pitt Coach Foge
Fazio has had trying to squeeze Bob
Buczkowski into his defense.

Despite his 6-foot-5, 260~pound
frame, his physique had never been"
confused with that of Bill Fralic. A
separated shoulder combined with a
lack of motivation has thrown
Buczkowski into that huge cauldron
that blue-chip recruits face plenty of
potential but little production in two
seasons.

An improved commitment from
Buczkowski at Pitt’s fall camp,
however, has magniﬁed his role on
the defensive line, according to
Fazio. ' V

“Bob Buczkowski is the key,”
Fazio said. He’s the guy who has to
take [Bill] Maas’s place. He’s the guy
who has to be a dominant, steady,
force and he’s the guy who has to
make the sacks. He's the guy who,
when they run his way in a tight
situation, has to make a great play.”
' He’s also the guy who must
challenge Tim Quesne, a 6-2,
250-pound senior, for the starting
job at left tackle. Buczkowski
surrendered "it midway through last
season following a shoulder injury.

defense. -

“We are ‘looking good, that’s all
that matters.”

Buczkowski ended his shot
putting career to preserve his
shoulder and his football career. A
state champion at Gateway High
School, Buczkowski heaved the shot
54 feet, 4 1/2 inches to win the Big
East indoor championship as a
freshman at Pitt.

He had practiced little with a
l6-pound shot, which outweighs the
high school shot by four pounds, but
nonetheless captured the title. He
had hoped to add three more to his
collection, but football is more
important.

“Track is a little easier, but I like
football, Buczkowski said. “I like
them both a lot, but I don’t think Ill
be able to throw the shot any more. I
wouldn’t want to risk having to give
everything up. My priority is
football.” v

After his return, they alternated for
the rest of the year.

“He has to work on staying
healthy, that’s what he’s got to work
on,” said Don Thompson, defensive
line coach. “He cannot improve if
he’s not out there. He went out this
spring and came back in pretty good
shape for himself this summer. He’s
been practicing every day and been
getting better every day."

Buczkowski’s shoulder has not
been a problem at fall camp. Quense
missed practice last week with a
virus. This last week at Edinboro
University provided an intense
battle for the position.

“Bob is a lot more serious about
his game than he used to be,"
Thompson said. “He has matured;
he’s a junior now. He knows that -if
he works very, very hard he can.
become an outstanding player. He
has become more serious about his
techniques, trying to improve.

 

“Buczkowski has different
physical attributes than Quense.
Bob is bigger, stronger, has good
movement. Quense played a lot and
has good experience, so it should be
a good battle.” -

Buczkowski would prefer not to
alternate again this season, but will
do so if he must. His main concern is
remaining healthy and improving
the Pitt defense, one which has been
outplayed by the offense thus far.

“I guess it seems to be that way but
it's just that the offense is so good
this year,” Buczkowski said.
“Usually the defense is so much
better than the offense, but this year

His parents, Robert and Diane,
tackled the 2 l/2-hour drive from
Monroeville to Edinboro three
times last week to watch their son. It
was no surprise, because they have
been to every one of his track meets
and football games since ninth
grade.

Buczkowski said that his parents’
support has been positive. It is easier
to recover from three-a-day
confrontations with F ralic when
Mom and Dad are on the sidelines.

“Just seeing your family up here,
especially up here, where there ain't
nothing to do but football, helps a
lot. It helps seeing your mom and

 The Commuter Association

Several services have also
been implemented to serve
commuters once they have

arrived on campus. The Com-
muter Bandit is the Commuter
Association's modern-day ver-
sion of the folk hero. Several
times over the fall and winter
terms, the Bandit will go in
search of expired parking
meters and save commuters
from the villanious “meter
maid”.

There is no sense combing
the campus grounds to look for
your friends when you can just
as easily and more effectively

leave them a message at the:

Message Center. Located in the
Concourse Area, it provides a

convenient mechanism for stu-_
dents to communicate within

the commuter community.

In cooperation with the Men-
tor Program, the Freshman
Adoption Service has been
implemented to prevent new
commuters from being islands
upon themselves. Mentors serve
as adoption counselors for
commuters
“adopted” by resident students
during freshman orientation.

The Commuter Association
is aware that there is always

2 room for improvement. We
want your suggestions on what
services and programs you
wouldlike to see in the future,
or how to improve those that
already exist. The Suggestion
Box is located at the Concourse
Service Center in the William
Pitt Union. Pick up a sugges-

lem or offer a suggestion for
improvement that will affect
students. V

PAT’S NEW FARE

By Maria Meliton

A Major changes to the city’s
"zone boundaries_and fare struc-
ture were initiated by the Port
Authority beginning on July 1,
1984. The alterations are
designed to generate additional
patronage and to limit the

0 abuse of the transfer privilege.

The old zone system is
reduced to five zones, and the
incremental fare per zone after
the initial boarding point is
reduce to 25¢. For any zone, the
base fare for a one-‘zone ride will

gremain $1. As in the previous
PAT fare system," the cost of a
_ ride is determined by the zone

are made within the three-hour

transfers must be surrendered to

purchase the same transfer for

an additional charge of 25¢. ~

Each time the transfer is repur-

The transfer may be ‘reused a

Stennett rises to challenge after demotion

Ray WusIich/ The Pitt News

Flanker Matt Stennett is challenging his critics.

By Joe Zeff
The Pitt News

EDINBORO A lumpy
mattress and screeching bedsprings
can offer restless nights in the
Edinboro University dormitories,
but those are only minor
distractions compared to the
situation facing Matt Stennett at
Pitt’s fall football drills.

He was welcomed to camp as the
f1fth—string ﬂanker.

“I didn’t really understand it,"
Stennett said. “I guess it was because
I missed spring ball because of
baseball. But it sure surprised the
heck out of me. I know the plays as
much as those guys, so it must have
been due to spring ball.”

It was during spring drills that
sophomore Dwayne Milloy staked
his claim to the starting Ilanker’sjob
opposite split end Bill Wallace.
Stennett, also a sophomore, was
busy as a starting centerfielder for
the Pitt baseball team.

“Going to spring ball helps you in
that you can improve, but I feel that
this fall I haven’t really lost
anything,” Stennett said. “It just
takes me a couple days to get back
into it.”

Since getting back into it,
Stennett has moved up to second
team and still has a shot at starting.

“I started off really well," he said.
“I practiced the first two days and I
was catching the ball well, running
the routes well. Then I missed three
days with a bruised thigh and
bruised knee. That set me back a
little bit.”

Stennett returned to shoulder
pads last Friday morning and

continued his assault for the starting
post. Milloy watched from the
sideline with a separated shoulder.

“Matt has progressed extremely
well and I’m very pleased," said Kent
Schoolfield, Pitt's receiver coach.
“He didn't go to spring ball but that
hasn’t stopped him from progressing
in practice. Right now he’s probably
our third wide receiver behind [Jeff]
Casper and [Bill] Wallace.”

Receiver is a relatively new
position for Stennett. He was a
6-foot, l8l—pound All-America
running back at Shaler, where he
rushed for 3,354 yards and 3|
touchdowns in three seasons. A foot
injury which qualified him for a
redshirt in his freshman year
precipitated the move to ﬂanker.

“When he came back, it just
seemed like every time he ran the
ball he just couldn’t go anywhere,”
Pitt coach Forge Fazio said. “He
was just getting smashed since he
never really bulked himself up over
the summer. .

“Matt is important and we need to
have him at flanker. Milloy is
injured and hasn’t been there,
Wallace and Casper are pretty
banged up, too.”

Stennett relieved injured starter
Dwight Collins at times last season,
catching I3 passes for 139 yards. His
speed — he runs the 40 in 4.6
seconds — and hands are assets, as is
his attitude.

“Matt is becoming a real student
of the game,” Schoolfield said. “The
last couple weeks we have been
drawing up plays and talking about
coverages, and I think Matt is
getting a better understanding of
what his role is."

Pitt quarterbacks John Congemi,
John Cummings and Dante Wiley

took turns throwing to the shifty 5»?

Stennett in a scrimmage last Friday.
The glut of quarterbacks was
evident, but Stennett found a
definitive favorite.

“I think Congemi throws the best
ball to catch,” he said. “He doesn’t
have the strongest arm on the team,
but...he’s always right on target.

“Wiley and Cummings both have
real strong arms. They can unload it
when they want to, but I think
Congemi is more accurate than
either of them. He knows where to

throw it and when to» throw it. He

just has that knack.”

Stennett has a knack of his own,
one of pounding baseballs and
catching fly balls. He was a standout
player at Shaler under Jerry
Matulevic and helped the Titans to
the I980 PIAA championship.

“I really like baseball a lot," he
said. “I really had a good time
playing it this year and I had a pretty
good year. I might favor that
somewhat.

“But when I say I favor baseball, I
like the game.
college baseball program, it's
nothing compared to football. There
will be more interest this year (with
Pitt joining the Big East) but not a
lot.”

Stennett admits it can become
lonely playing baseball at Trees

Field, where 50 spectators is a big b

crowd.

“The thing I like about football is
that it is so magnified. It’s fun to play
in those big games. lt’sjust a totally
different atmosphere than
baseball, where there is not as many
people and it’s not as magnified . . . .
Nobody really notices you except
for the major leagues."

things that have happened in the
past, he has a big chance to make a
contribution now."

— Foge Fazio, Pitt head coach.

By Charlie O'Hara
The Pitt News

EDINBORO — Fifth-year senior
ﬂanker Jeff Casper has waited long
and endured plenty to get where he is
today.

“Jeff told me he’ll do anything he
can to play this year," receiver coach
Kent Schoolfield said.

Casper, a 6-2, I95-pound Trinity
High School graduate with a total of
six receptions for 89 yards at Pitt, is
the No. I flanker on the Panthers’
preseason depth chart.

“Jeff Casper has always had the
talent,” Schoolfield said. “Due to a
lack of opportunity and all the injur-

. ies, he’s only had one spring and one

fall where he could show that he can
play.” « .

During his freshman season in
1980, Casper broke his right foot. In
spring drills the following April he

_ reinjured the same foot, and was

redshirted for his sophomore year.

The second coming of that sopho-
more season brought more
frustration.

Julius Dawkins, Dwight Collins,
Barry Compton and Keith Williams
caught passes from Dan Marina in
1982 while Casper watched from the
sidelines.

“The coaches were reluctant .to

think about putting me in the pres-
sure situations then,” Casper said. “I
went through a lot of anxiety on the
sidelines, but I never doubted in my
mind that I could play.”

The ‘perseverence test continued
in 1983.

Before spring drills, Casper had a
disc removed from his lower back,
missing practice and falling further
into anonymity.

“I didn’t even get a chance to work
with Coach Schoolfield until fall
camp last year,“ he explained. “I
think that Matt Stennett [who
started much of last season when
Collins was injured] had a deﬁnite
advantage because he got to practice
during the spring with Coach
Schoolfield.

“When it came time for fall camp,
he knew what to expect from Matt
but he still hadn't seen me play."

Finally, he received his due —— and
playing time — last season.

He was put in the lineup slowly,
inserted more as a blocker and decoy
for other receivers. He caught only
four passes, the longest being 26
yards against Army.

In Pitt's Fiesta Bowl loss to Ohio
State Casper got a chance to display
his quick feet and superb hands on
national television.

On two crucial third down plays
during different drives in the fourth
quarter, Casper came up with two
clutch ﬁrst down receptions.

“That was the breaking point for
me,” Casper said. “The thing that I
really needed to bolster my confi-
dence. It felt really good to finally be
able to make the clutch play.”

Following the game, Casper.’s best
friend on the team, split end Bill

Wallace, approached him.

“I'll never forget it," Casper said.
“Billy was really excited for me. He
told me that I have one heckuva

-chance of starting next season.

Those words meant a lot to me.”

‘ Playing opposite of Wallace this ,

season should provide Casper with

. plenty of opportunity along with a

good look at man-to-man coverage.
“We'll need the flankers to come

’ through," Congemi said. A lot of the
defenses that we will face this season.

will play coverages to stop Billy.

“Jeff is a lot like Billy and he’ll
help the offense out greatly. He'll be
able to compliment Billy and lighten
the load on him."

Casper is determined to prove
that he is a complete receiver. He has
worked hard on his strength and
blocking techniques.

“Coach Schoolfield teaches us
how to block on every play,” Casper
said. “Every play we hit defensive
backs. I want to be a particularly
agressive blocker this season.”

Fazio believes that successful
teams need people that have gone
through what Casper‘ has.

“He has really hung in there
against a lot of adversity,” Fazio
said. This -is his fifth year and he has
matured. I think if this team is going
to reach its potential we are going to
need a kid. like Jeff Casper.”

Jeff Casper must tackle a starting assignment.

“Troy Benson and Caesar Aldi-
sert are both outstanding line-
backers,” Fazio said. “I don’t hink
there is a better pair oflinebackers in
the East, and, as l’ve said before,
those two have a chance to be the
best pair of linebackers we’re ever
had here at Pitt.”

\',

Apke, who won Fazio’s respect as

a starter in the Fiesta Bowl when
Aldisert was out with an injured
knee, was named the most improved
defensive player at spring drills and

i did well at Edinboro.

Defensive Backs

Free safety Tom Flynn, strong
safety Ray Weatherspoon and left
cornerback Troy Hill are gone; only
Melvin Dean, who broke up a team-
high 15 passes and recorded 57 tack-
les, ' returns at the right corner.

Junior Bill Callahan, who shared
starting time with Weatherspoon
last season, has been switched to free
safety to replace Flynn. Sopho-
mores Keith Tinsley and Reggie
Smith are the leading candidates to
take over at the left cornerback and
strong safety, unless quarterback-
turned-defensive back Chris Jelic
can adjust to his new position in time
for Brigham Young.

Split End E

Bill Wallace returns for his
senior season after catching 45
passes for 727‘..yards and eight touch-
downs as a junior. Wallace closed
out last season with a ﬂourish by
catching 10 passes for 173 yards and
three touchdowns against Penn
State and catching eight more passes

for 97 yards in the Fiesta-Bowl

against Ohio State.
Quarterback

Junior John Congemi “proved

he can get thejob done,” says Fazio. -

Congemi, who replaced John Cum-
mings after last season’s first game
with Tennessee, ‘completed I70 of
286 passes for 1,940 yards and I6

Utouchdowns last season. He set

Fiesta Bowl records for completions
(31) and total offense (361 yards).
Cummings, who broke his collar-
bone on Pitt’s final offensive play
against Tennessee and was red-
shirted last season, is also ‘a junior.

.At fall camp he was challenged by

freshman Dante Wiley from
Jeannette, who could be Fazio’s
choice if Congemi was rusty.

Offensive Line

Four of last year’s five starting
linemen are back, led by Bill Fralic,

Pitt’s consensus All-America tackle

and tri-captain. Gone is center Jim
Sweeney, a second-round pick ofthe
New York Jets. Fralic, of course,

‘held down the left tackle spot last
season and ﬁnished among the final- _

ists for theiOutland and Lombardi

awards, in addition to finishing

eighth in the Heisman balloting.
Junior Tony Brown started every

/game at right tackle and will face a

stiff challenge from sophomore

Randy Dixon. Juniors Bob Brown ‘

(right guard) and Mike Dorundo
(left guard) gotthe majority of the
work at their respective positions,
but senior Greg Christy entered
camp ahead of Dorundo. Junior

Stone on the move

By Charlie O’Hara
The Pitt News

EDINBORO — After gaining
more than 3,000 yards at Pitts-
burgh’s Thomas Jefferson High
School, Darnell Stone thought his
running ability was innate.

His belief was shaken last Sep-

' tember when he began a long slide

from starting tailback to a forgotten
member of the Pitt football team.

He broke his left wrist in the fourth.

game against West Virginia and
never returned. _ .

Two weeks ago, the 6-1, 215-
pound junior was switched to strong
safty.

“I think it’s a major transition,”
Stone said. “I’m learning a lot of new
formations, a lot of new sets that are
almos_t the opposite from what I've
been used to since I was so little.”

The switch has prompted a

change in Stone’s thinking.

“I have an offensive-oriented
mind. I’ve carried the ball since I
started playing.”

Stone has not played since the
West Virginia game. The healing
process was long enough to keep
Stone out of spring drills.

His innate athletic ability and .

Pitt’s recruiting bonanza at running
back turned Stone into a defensive
back right before spring practices.

“I had a meeting with running
back coach [Andy] Urbanic and he
told me thatit could be a very good
move for me. Playing running back
last yeariwas crazy. If you made a
mistake, you could be-lifted at any
time.”

Reading tight ends in pass cover-
age and providing support against

' the run are the primary responsibili-

ties ofa strong safety, and Stone said
he has a way to 20 to master them.
“There are a lot of coverages that I
have to learn. When the time comes,
I think that [can really be one ofthe

best at my position. ’

“Right now I just want . to get
myself established at this new posi-
tion, but I also want to play.”

“its going to take some time, but
he’s definitely good enough to start,”
said Dino Folino, Pitt defensive
backfield coach. “He‘s very good on
run support, but he has to work on
his finesse in pass coverage.

“He’s adjusting well. I hope he’ll
be able to be a starter by the middle
of the season.” _

Standing in Stone's way is sopho-
more Reggie Smith of Bayonne,
N.J. Coach Foge Fazio said the 6-2,
195 pound Smith will play
somewhere.

“Reggie is a real good athlete and
we have to find a spot for him.”

“Reggie is Darnell’s only competi-
tion,” Folino said. '“That’s it, it’s
those two.” .

Smith is more-adept at pass cover-
age, but Stone could be ahead in run
defense by the end of fall camp.

“He's a tough hitter,“ Fazio "said.
“Darnell has been one of our better
special teams players, too. He’s
excellent.” _

During a small-scale scrimmage,
Stone made two solid tackles in a
goal-line ‘stand, stopping two of
Pitt’s highly touted freshman run-
ning backs.

“I’m not afraid to hit any of

them,” Stone said, “and when I was 9

running I wasn’t afraid to take a hit.
I’m in a hit position now.

' “Having played offense‘ may be an

‘advantage but I can’t use it now. I

have to read and react the way a
defender does. I sure can’t sit back
and try to guess what they are
calling.”

' The presence of freshmen running
backs Craig Heyward, Ezekial Gad-
son, Charles Gladman and Anthony
Brown, and the spring performances
of Chuckie Scales and Billy Owens
paved the way for Stone’s move to
defense.

The Pitt News

EDINBORO —— Rodney Danger-
field, meet John Kukalis. .

After’ spending the past three
years as a punching bag for Jimbo
Covert, Rob Fada and Bill Fralic on
the scout team, Kukalis, a fifth—year

V senior, did not get a listing on the

pre-season depth chart.

John Kukalis, a 6-5, 220-pound
defensive tackle, gets no respect. His
only varsity football letters are from
Kiski Area High School, where he
also played basketball and track.
The expectations have not panned
out since choosing Pitt over Miami
(Fla.) and Clemson in 1980.

“I'll never regret that decision,” he
said recently in the Edinboro Uni-
versity dining hall, conducting one
of his few interviews at fall camp.
Though he has -not excited the
coaches or media in hiscareer, he
has satisfied himself.

“Sometimes you get discouraged‘

and disgusted,” he said, “ups and
downs the whole way through. Ijust

fight through it. You just have to go
out and do your best and maybe

p something will change.”

Something did change at fall
camp. Kukalis was shifted from def-
ensive end, where senior Chris Dole-
man andjunior Bob Schilken are the
starters to defensive tackle.

“Kook’s coming along,”said head
coach Foge Fazio. “We moved him
to a defensive tackle, from a stand-
up position to a down position. He’s
a littleelight for that right now, but
he’s getting better and working very
hard. Right now he’s working with
the third unit.”

The same third unit which serves
as fodder for the first unit in prac-
tice. It takes dedication to endure
what Kukalis does, only to become a
spectator from the sidelines.

“Yeah, it bothers me, but youjust
gotta try your best,” he said. “They
say the best players play, but I keep
trying. Everyone goes through it. All
the guys. Bill Maas was on scout
team the first year he came down
here. Tim Quense, Dennis Atiyeh.”

“He got a lot out of fighting in the
trenches and in time he might be able

to help this team at a position,”

Thompson said. “He has been with
me last fall and this spring, and he’s

very very willing. It‘s gonna take

some time to match him with a posi-

tion, but he has some attributes.”

Meanwhile, Kukalis remains
patient._He understands his situa-
tion and works with the third team
to make the first team a better one.
His sacrifices are many, but he will
graduate with two degrees in
accounting.

“Maybe you’re not good enough
to play and they put you down there
to get some work," Kukalis said.
“it’s always being filmed so you
always get a good look down there.
You are just going ‘against the start-
ing offense, the Fralics.

“I had to go up against Fralic all

"the time. Everyone knows what he '

is, but you just go against him. You
protect yourself. Sometimes you get
pissed off, you gotta get pissed off
and go right at him.

‘‘It was intimidating at first, but
you just do your best and they’ll
respect you. You have to earn
respect." '

Oklahoma

Pitt will host the Big Eight Confer-
ence runner-up on September 15.
The Panthers haven’t faced Barry
Switzer’s Sooners since Tony Dor-
sett was a junior at Pitt. Oklahoma
bombed the Panthers, 46-l0, hold-
ing Dorsett to just 17 yards.

Oklahoma recorded an 8-4 mark
last season. Mediocre would best
describe the squad that failed to fin-
ish the season in the Top 20. In fact
the team has missed the Top 10 for
three consecutive seasons, having
lost 12 games in that span.

Leading the returning cast for
Oklahoma is sophomore running
back Spencer Tillman (5-ll, 209).
After Marcus Dupree quit the team
last season, Tillman became the first
Sooner freshman ever to rush for
more than l,000 yards in a season.
He was only the second freshman in
the history of the Big Eight Confer-
ence to eclipse the mark. He rushed
for more than l00 yards in five dif-
ferent games, including 134 yards
against national runner-up
Nebraska. '

The Sooners have three-year

~starting senioigquarterback Danny

Bradley (5-10, 187) in charge of what
should be a versatile offense, with
Tillman and senior wide receiver

‘ Buster Rhymes.

On" defense, the team is led by
senior defensive end Kevin Murphy
(6-2, 225). Murphy was a second All-
America and first team Big Eight
choice.

 

Temple

Pitt travels to Veterans Sta-
dium in Philadelphia to take on the

. Owls. The Panthers have dominated

the series of late, outscoring Temple,
I44-I9, over the past «four years.
Last season Pitt whipped the

Owls, 35-0, in Panther quarterback‘

John Congemi’s first collegiate start.
He completed 15 of23 passes for I77
yards and a touchdown in that
game. Meanwhile, Temple was held
to just 14 yards rushing.

The Owls lost quarterback and
leader Tim Riordan (Philadelphia
Stars) to graduation and will count
on 6-3, 197 poundfreshman James
Thompson to take his place.

On defense the squadiis led by
senior defensive back Anthony
Young (6-0, 187). Young has ll
interceptions to his credit and is
starting for his third straight season.

  West Virginia

The Mountaineers come to Pitt
Stadium for a September ..-29
meeting. '

Last season West Virginia (9-3)
finished in the Top 20 and defeated
Kentucky, 20-16., in the Independ-

‘ence Bowl. But the team’s biggest

victory of the season was against
Backyard Brawl rival Pitt, 24-2l.

3' The victory was the Mountai- .

neers’ first against the Panthers in

. eight years.

This year the Mountaineers have
a lot of question marks. Heading the

list is the quarterback; who can‘

replace Jeff Hostetler, now with the
New York Giants?

Junior Tony Reda (6-0, 195)
seems to be the choice in Morgan-
town, although senior Kevin White
(6-0, 185) has playing experience.

The team’s kicking game is proba-
bly as good as any in the country,
with All-America placekicker Paul
Woodside returning for his senior
year and junior Steve Superick
doing the punting.

East Carolina

The Panthers are home for the

, fourth time in the team’s first four

games when East Carolina visits
Oakland on October 6.

It will be the first meeting between
the two teams. The Pirates finished
the 1983 season at 8-3 and ranked in
the Top 20 for the first time in the
school's history.

Entering the season the team does
not have a quarterback who has
taken a snap during a game.

The most exciting player the inex-
perienced Pirates will bring to Pitt
Stadium is ﬂanker/return specialist
Henry Williams (5-6, 180). He led
the nation in kick returning with a
31.1 yard average per return.

The tailback spot is the only other
offensive skill position where the
Pirates have any experience. Both
Tony Baker (5-10, 170) and Jim
Waldon (5-l0, I74) return. The two

, have combined for 2,051 yards.

The defense is led by linebackers
P.J. Jordan (6-2. 226) and Tyrone

Johnson (6-0, 226) and_ nose guard 1~

Chris Santa Cruz (6-5, 230).

In his fifth year at East Carolina,
head coach Ed Emory has turned the
program into a winner. His record
stands at 24-20. I

South Carolina

The Panthers go on the road for
an October 6 visit to ‘one of the most
hostile home crowds in college foot-
ball -- the eternally sold out
Willian1S—BriCe Stadium on the cam-

Panthers tackle toughest schedule in years

pus of the University of South
Carolina. -

South Carolina’s junior quarter-
back Allen Mitchell returns at quar-
terback. Last season against Duke,
with the Gamecocks trailing, l4-0,
Mitchell came off the bench to lead

the team to a thrilling 31-24 victory. 
He threw for 240 yards and two

touchdowns and was named the
national offensive player-of-the-

i week bv Sports Illustrated.

New Music Seminar looks to the future

By Bryan J. Fischer

The Pitt News Orientation Issue

NEW YORK — In T980 the term ‘new music’ failed to register
much response from most Americans. The listening habits of
record buyers seemed hopelessly mired in another decade. The
Doors, The Who and Led Zepplin appearedcapable of filling the
American appetite for rock and roll indefinitely. Scarse men-
tion of a ‘new wave’ of music from Britain was met more often
than not with disdain and contempt.

Similarly, record companies
living well off a seemingly
insatiable desire for product,
resisted innovative bands that
failed to fit their profitable
prescription. Radio stations,
the final ray of progressive
hope, blindly followed
record companies with a stra-
tegy of give the people‘ what
they want, while ignoring
what was happening in alter-
native music circles.

‘Mark Josephson saw the
alternatives. In the spring of
1980, Josephson and a few
close friends organized a con-
vention intended to draw
together diverse interests
within the record industry.
Their goal was to exchange
ideas and consider future
directions. And they
exchanged ideas. And they
considered the future.

More importantly, the 250
registrants. and 50 or so
panelists that gathered for

. that first convention began to

make an impression on the
sensibility of an industry.
. While Josephson staged his

’ convention, college radio sta-

tions and dance clubs became
increasingly daring in their
support of new sounds. Inde-
pendent labels grew in stature
as a source of alternative
offerings and the music-video
revolution, led by the cable-
born.
With each of these develop-

’ments came an increasingly

large and more aware audience
making it necessary for the
music business to reconsider
the future.

Earlier this month, mid-

_ town Manhattan again played

host to Josephson's gathering,
now the largest and most
influential music ‘convention
held in the United States.
Known simply as the New
Music Seminar, the .conven-
tion attracted more than 4,000
musicians, managers, booking
agents, club owners, video
makers and representatives
from both major and inde-
pendent record labels from 40
states and more than 20 for-
eign countries. Clearly a sign
of increasing American
tolerance.

”Regardless of its limita-
tions and liabilities I would
argue that [The New Music
Seminar] is a better, more con-
structive, more open—minded
gathering than any other con-
vention,” Josephson told Boston
Rock magazine prior to the
Seminar.

Indeed.

‘ Discussion panels, which
provide the seminar’s greatest
information exchange, ranged
in subject matter from inde-

pendent labels to black music’

marketing and promotion to
new music radio. The artists

SEMINAH

room only crowd, proved
emblematic of the seminar’s
accessibility. With an all—star
cast ranging from the nebu-
lous Madonna to the legend-
ary James Brown, the panel
served as a perfect backdrop
for Josephson's notion of a
convention where ”everybody
can take part.”

CIDCI

”We have to be willing to
express disgust at that which
is rubbish,” declared producer
Trevor Horn in his keynote
address to the seminar. ”We
must refuse to accept that
which is commercial and consi-
dered hip.” _ _

Horn, whose remarks drew
frequent applause from the
packed ballroom, has gained
widespread notoriety in music
circles as a band member (with
Yes, the Buggles and currently
Art of Noise), a producer (Yes,
ABC) and founding father of
ZTT Records. Having known
the music business as a
songwriter, performer,
producer and record label
executive, Horn spoke from
great experience in

challenging the audience to
”celebrate that which is daring
and innovative.”

In pointing a wary finger at
the people responsible for
making and popularizing
records, Horn offered weighty
words to an industry caught
between substance and com-
mercialism:_ ”Let’s not talk
about the future of the music
business,” he said, ”let’s talk
about the future of music.”

CIEID

Although the vast majority
of the New Music Seminar
isdirected at industry people,
there were interesting diver-
sions. A panel ingeniously
titled ”Press” proved to be the
most worthwhile.

Collected around co-
moderators Nelson George-of
Billboard magazine and New
York Times music editor John
Rockwell were some of the fin-
est narrative voices in rock and
roll: the animated music editor

of The Village Voice, Roberta.

Christgau; Ken Tucker of :the
Philadelphia Inquirer,-' and New
York Times music critic, Robert

magazine puts

Palmer. With Rolling Stone's

.Kurt Loder unable to attend

due to illness, only the absence
of Dave Marsh, who took part
in last year's panel, and the Los
Angeles Times’ Robert Hilburn,
hard at work on the ‘definitive’
Michael Jackson biography,
kept this from being an aston-
ishing Who's Who of rock and
roll writers.

When Boston Rock publisher
Mike Dreese offered that his
its greatest
efforts into ”trying to catch
new trends at the independent
[label] level,” he drew great
applause from the audience
and envy, no doubt, from fel-
low panelists who are forced to
deal with the restrictive pub-
lishing powers that be.

”lt’s been a consistent prob-
lem for fifteen years, trying to
give exposure to new bands,”
said the Inquirer's Ken Tucker.
Editor's at most metropolitan
newspapers are generally
reluctant to allow significant
space for artists that lack a
major following. John
Rockwell, an editor himself,
spoke of fighting a ”well
established bias" in the strug-
gle for more coverage.

While affording space‘ to
such worthwhile new acts as
R.E.M. and Dream Syndicate
offers no small measure of
redemption, Tucker ruefully
acknowledged that if Journey
were to play a sold out Phila-
delphia Spectrum, the Inquirer
entertainment desk would be
expected to cover it. 

These concerns made for an
interesting parallel with the
thoughts Trevor Horn

expressed in his keynote.

 

address. Although I-Ior'n’s
remarks about celebrating
that which is daring and
innovative were aimed prim-
arily at those most responsible
for making and distributing
records, writers also struggle

to present what is ”important .

and significant" in the place of
often
”commercial concerns,’
according to the editor of
Record magazine, Wayne King.
If David Bowie put out an
album of shameless crap,
would it demand greater

I

attention than an independ-
ently produced’ 7" EPcapable of

indomitable‘

expanding the borders of the
pop music listening audience?
Robert Christgau seemed to
have the last word on the sub-
ject when he s-aid simply, ”I
refuse to cover something
because it's independent. I
cover it because it's good.”

WWW

No other segment of the
record industry has taken as
much blame for the frustra-
tion of progressive music as A
& R departments at record lab-
els. A 8: R (literally, artists in
repertiore) holds the’responsi-
bility for keeping an ear to the
the ground for the purpose of
developing and maintaining a
label's roster of artists.

Simply put, it is A & R's job
to keep in touch. By spending
time in ‘clubs, listening to col-
lege and alternative radio,
reading the various fanzines
and music papers and sorting
through demonstration tapes
—— anywhere from a handful to
dozens per week —— A & R is
expected to percieve trends
before they happen and to cap-
italize on them when they do.

«”I refuse to cover something

because it's independent, Icover
it because it's good."
——Robert Christgau

I

It is this function — that of
keeping in- touch — where
many claim that record com-
panies have- failed. Critics
point to the dichotomy of pro-
gressive bands, such as Run-

DMC, the Beastie Boys and

7,?

Salem 66, who struggleiwith
the scarce resources of inde-

pendent labels, while musical’

fat cats with little to contrib-
ute to the industries future —
Rod Stewart and Paul
McCartney, for instance —— eat
up enormous financial advan-
ces as well as yaluable promo-
tions and marketing efforts.
Rod Stewart and Paul
McCartney sell a significant
number of records of course,

' - but could the same be said for

Salem 66 if aided by the power
that a Columbia Records,

cles? The stagnation that took , . 1

place in the music business in
the mid-1970's offers ammu-
nition to the argument of
progressives.

Although the differences
between major labels and
smaller, independent labels are
many, recruitment of talent is
certainly a major one as Nancy

”- Jeffries from A 82; M Records

explained. 1
’’Major labels are initiallv
interested in celebrity this
who can bring publicity to the
label._Then they are free to
pursue developing acts."
Indeed this philosophical
difference in acquiring talent

has led to the proliferation _

(and success) of many inde-
pendent labels. With a_ small
roster_of artists these labels
are able to perform the range
of record label duties such as
marketing and promotion

with more personal input and
with far less in-house conflict.
Major labels, on the other
hand, deal with a corporate
structure which shifts the
impetus away, from sponta-
neity and adventurism.

”The corporate structure.

Bob Biggs, President of Slash

at the heart of growth in this

Slash, which has broken a

Femmes and the Blasters,

Chung may boast of a bit of breathing
room inla business that is always in
favor of the clever, fresh and
innovative as long as they are able to
stake out an audience with clever,

' fresh and innovative (not to mention

generous) spending habits.

Wang Chung has come a long way
in a very short time, but Hues sports
no self-serving grandiloquence. -He
knows where he came from and is
confident enough to hazard a guess
as to where he's headed.

Weaned on rock and roll, Hues
immersed himself in pop music until.

and was writing all kinds gf weird

I decided that I wanted to get back A

answered some adverts in the Melody I

Though they rehearsed and
performed together, Jack Hues and
Nick Feldman were not monetarily
successful by any stretch of the
imagination. For survival, Hues made
use of his educational background
and began lecturing part—time at
London University.

"That was really lucrative. I used to
earn enough money to live and pay
the rent and everything, and I still
had time to play. lused to teach about
three days a week, I suppose, and a
couple of evenings.

"We got a band together called
Intellektuals [the creative spelling
dubiously credited to Feldman] that
was just a crazy sort of punk band.
Smash things up. Really anarchic sort

"Uh . . . [he chuckles] . . . a lot. I
mean, I ‘work with the other guys
because I need them. It's not as if I just .

[he makes a pointing gesture
toward the wall that lies between
himself and the ongoing Cars
concert] . . . Iwouldn't»say I was like
Ric [Ocasek] in The Cars — he says
he does something like 99 percent of
it. I would never make statements
like that, and it wouldn't be true if I
did. I think I'm probably more finicky
than the others, and I think I have a
quicker overall grasp of what I want a
thing to sound like. But then, they
keep me on my toes a lot. Quite often,
I find myself getting a bit bogged
down with things, and then Nick is
particularly good at sort of

of stuff."

The word "anarchic" rolls‘ off his‘
tongue and through his soft British
accent with professorial style. A

broad smile. He brushes his hair back _

with his fingers, his floppy yellow
shirt offset boldly by a pair of baggy
blackitrousers held to his waist by a

was once a punk? The paradox
surfaces. He remembers punky Jack.

’'I suppose, like a lot of people, Ihad
pretty short hair at the time. I used to

* wear suits. A kind of austere look.

Less relaxed than Wang Chung. The
whole thing was very austere at the

I time and undisciplined, in a way that

a lot of punk bands were. It amounted
to the same sort of thing in the end.
We used to go berserk on stage.”

Following the ill . fate of
Intellektuals, Hues and Feldman
continued to work together as
songsmiths and laid the foundation
for what would prove to be, in
retrospect, a veritable new wave
supergroup, in the rough, of course.

"We got the band 57 Men together.
The singer from Heaven 17 was our
singer then and Bow Wow Wow’s
future bass player was working for
us. We met Darren at thatpoint,who
is now the drummer with Wang
Chung-. That band lasted about a year
but it didn't really work out. I think
basically I found that I have to do it
myself. I don't like to delegate
everything to other people."

Plot another point on the curve.

Just beyond the thick concrete, in
the huge 17,000-seat room down the

' hall, The Cars’ rip through their pop

smash, "Magic." The muffled racket
doesn't appear to disturb Hues,
comfortably situated, leaning
restfully against the far ‘arm of the
sofa. His wide set eyes never avert a
glance. He massages the evening
stubble that winds down through the
cleft in his chin. He know's precisely
what he's looking for. The -band's
name - his discovery. The album title
- his idea. Just how much control does

suggesting alternatives or just
lightening the atmosphere."

A light, easy atmosphere. Such is
the aura of Wang Chung. Hues is no
exception. Whether he is sitting
backstage perusing fan mail,
‘marveling over the beautiful flowers
given to him by some wobbly-kneed
female or unwinding on the tour bus
with a book on Mozart, Hues comes
across as content, relaxed and secure.
He once again gestures toward the
muffled sounds of the concert. A
song ends, followed by skull-splitting
cheers. .

"For me, it's very important not to
get mixed up in that noise out there.
If I believed in that for one second, I
think I'd be headed downhill. I'm not
saying that doesn't mean anything to
me. It's great. It's obviously a mark of

how things have changed a lot for me
in the last six months, in terms of the
sort of places I've played. But it
doesn't mean I'm any better as a
person now-than I was then."

DDCI

Despite the increasing exposure of
Wang Chung and the band's rigorous
touring pace, Jack Hues maintains a
flexible, introspective character. He
doesn't enjoy MTV. He rarely
watches it. He loves Chinese food.
And he definitely appreciates fine
architecture.

"I suppose, on the road, it's a big
interest for me. I like to get into the
towns we visit."

A A visit to‘ Pittsburgh offered Hues
the near quintessential American

. I experience, including : I s V 2 I I

v V P I-lIulvbV_.‘gI_.V.’..’ ._

The yellow bell and the quest for perfect vibration A

1) a downtown lunch-hour traffic
jam — He amused himself with the
design of the buildings.

2) a one night stay at a Howard
Johnson's Motor Lodge. .

3) an evening at the movies. The
feature? Ghostbusters, no le ss.

4) an appearance at a local record
store for a two-hour autograph
session,‘ replete with squealing,
pop-fashioned pubescent cuties.

He was pleasantly surprised.

"I've never been here before, and I
imagined it to be kind of a heavy sort
of town in that people haven't got a
lot of money. They aren't just into

luxury goods. And I alwaysfeel that .

Wang Chung is quite a luxury
commodity. I don't think we're a big
socially relevant band at all. Ithink
what we're about is very aesthetic.

It's brilliant to come to a town like"

this and get that sort of gut response.
That matters a lot."

But when all is said and done, Hues
is a steadfast, devoted Londoner.

"I guess, ultimately, that's where
I'm happiest. Because of my family
and everything. I prefer to be with
them, but I do get a kick out_ of
performing. By the end of this tour I
won't want to leave London for. . . I'll
go on holiday, actually, probably up
to Scotland or something like that . . .
But after that, I'll go back to London
and just write and stay at home. It'll
be peaceful and nice, and I love that."

‘ When in London, Hues makes his
home in a section of town that's "as
rural as you can get in the city," just
north of Regent's Park.

"Basically, if I want to walk into the
heart of London, I can take a

I . twenty-minute walk,'but I can take

fifteen minutes of that walking
through parks.”

But to live in America . . ..

"No. No. I don't think at the_
moment that I could live in America. I
don't feel at home here. America is

very much like this to me. Town ‘

halls. And it's work. I keep that
separate. I think you have to." '

While the experience of that series
of town halls continually pulls Hues
away from his more tranquil home,-
he recognizes the importance of
promotional touring and takes it all
quite casually.

"We've got to play to a lot of people,

and we get days like today where we
meet a lot of people, and I think we
leave a good impression. The next
time we come around, hopefully we'll
be doing our own shows."

But regardless of family ties and
aesthetic preference, America
remains a critical, not to mention
profitable, market to crack.

"I'd say, in America, people are far
more receptive and far, more
open-minded to new things than they
are in Europe. In Germany, we do
pretty well. "Dance Hall Days" has
probably been the most popular

European record this summer. It's‘

been playing everywhere,
apparently. The most difficult
market for us is England.

"It’s because we're not really that
fashion-oriented, and the English are
very sensitive to bands that come
across saying that they're doing
something worthwhile. The whole
idea of English rock is that it is very
disposable and that it's just geared up
for the moment and it's there to
enjoy. Anybody that says they're
trying to do anything with durability
. . . Well, they don't want to know."

If it came down to a fashion move ‘

The Book Center is a departmental operation. Merchandise or services offered are categorized
into four given areas or departments. These are textbooks, new and used, trade, supplies, and »
sundries. All buying for these areas is premised on three basic principles. All items must be required
for a given course of program of the University. Items of this type are naturally the textbooks, used
books, and paperbacks. Second, trade department items are made available that are necesary
to supplement and complement the course study and to enhance the cultural and academic

- Hues maintains that he has no desire
to be a mannequin.

"It really holds no interest for me.

this Englishman, who is technically at

for its parent lp.

lane of big-time rock and roll than his
fellow/band members.

"They get into it," says Hues,
pulling his black, silver-glittered
socks further up from his white
shoes, only to let them contract into
bunches at his ankles.

”I enjoy it in different ways. Ijust

CICIEI

Beyond the yellow wall, the
concert begins to grind to its close
amid st the screaming plaudits of Cars
fans. Sensing the inevitable deluge of
people that would soon follow, Hues
stretches his legs out in front of
himself, preparing them to once
again support his lean and sturdy
frame. He ponders the prospective
direction of the new album.

"I imagine it will_ be a logical
development from the first album. I
don't think there will be any changes
in the actual character of the writing,
but as I say, I hope that the fringes
will be more deeply into areas other
than rock and roll. .

"For instance, I'd like to try this
track that has no tempo in it. I mean,
it has no real speed. It's just what I call
a linear series of events. Chords
coming in and things. I've written
some words while I've been out he re,
and I'll try to tie all that together.
That's one thing that might work out
well." ‘

And somewhere out there in the
musical cosmos, there is a yellow bell
with the name "Jack Hues" inscribed
upon it . . .

Wang Chung continues the pursuit for perfect vibration

"The yellow bell is a symbol of a
kind of cosmic perfect pitch that
produces a perfect vibration that is . . .

just made me laugh because I thought

trashy aspect of like.

resorts. to the imaginary guitar,
contorting himself in mimicry). You

"We were looking for something
different at the time. It's quite deeply
about me and the whole band. The
whole process of opposites. Slightly
sage. But there - are really no
opposites. They're all just facets of
the same thing and to understand
anything you've got to understand its
opposite. The essential paradox of
life. . . which I've really been through.
That's what it's all about."

The New Music Seminar acts not only as an information exchange
among record industry people, it also offers both major and inde-
pendent record labels a chance to disseminate their products among

those whose ears are most influential. Herein lies a sample of the

sounds whichwere most noteworthy -— for better or worse.

D.O.A. -— Bloodied but Unbowed. This compilation of five years
material shows Vancouver's D.O.A. to be one of the most vital bands
hardcore has yet produced. Chainsaw guitar lines, lyrics to make you
sit up straight and a_ sound that owes nothing to Mitch Easter,
Bloodied but Unbowed goes straight for the jugular and rarely
misses the mark. (C.D. Presents, Ltd.: 1230 Grant Avenue, Suite 531, San
Fransisco, CA 94133) ‘

Dogmatics — "Gimme the Shakes” blw "20 Flight Rock”. Boston's
burgeoning music scene manifests itself most frequently invthe
timeless sounds of garage bands and Dogmatics are no different.
The Eddie Cochran flip herepretty much tells the story. Without a
significant message of their own, Dogmatics fall carelessly back on
an eclectic appeal which attempts not to celebrate the past, but
merely to capitalize on it. (Cat Records: 16 Thayer Street, Boston, MA
02113)

Face to Face —— "Under the Gun" blw "Run from the Shot". Face to
Face build a solid foundation of pulsating bass and drums that makes
movement a natural reaction and the dance floor the only place to be.
A catchy little bit of tape looping and Laurie Sargents distinctive
vocals give this dance single a.’ niche of its’ own in a scene over-
crowded by stifling redundancy. (Epic Records)

Urbania-x — "Burning Circuits" blw "Burning Circuits"-(long ver-

.sion). If electronics and programming wizardry figure prominently in
your appreciation of new music, this 45 is for you. The product of

expatriated Polish jazz enthusiast Michal Urbaniak, ”Burning ‘Cir-
cuits” uses distorted vocals, and a maze of programmed rhythms to

~ weave a software beat that's long on energy, even if it's result lacks

the human touch. (Sonet Records: 121 Ledbury Road, London W 11)

like than an aspiring artist
would prefer, the luxuries of
money and a well established
place in the market make them

the first choice of bands ped-'

dling their product in search of
a recording contract.

companies like his own. '

On a given evening in Paris,
a filmgoer can avail himself to
any one of about a 100 differ-
ent. movies. In New York or

‘Washington or Boston, the

numbers shrink a little, but
there still plenty of choices.
Not just new films from Holly-
wood, but independent pro-
ductions and documentaries.
Not just newly—released
American films either, but
films from 20 or 30 years.ago,
from Hoboken to Bangkok.

While Pittsburgh may never
compete culturally with those
cities, it has responded, albeit
on a small scale, to the need for
alternative cinema.

means waiting for it on HBO, a
small core of avid film buffs
have sought wider fare. For
them there are places to go.
The Pittsburgh Playhouse
first began booking films in
the summer of 1957; three art
films per week every summer
for eleven years. The program
went year round in 1968, but
was discontinued several
times, and eliminated com-
pletely from 1973 to 1978.
Richard Rauh, the current
film director at the Playhouse
has been involved in the pro-
ject intermittently since 1968.
In December of 1978, he took
over the booking full-time and
has handled the chore ever
since. A V
Maybe feat is a better word
for it. Rauh personally goes
through 100-200 film request

cards that fill the Playhouse

one point, Rauh scheduled

network TV debut and three

Not only does Rauh have to

  Capitalizing on cinema: Oakland's wide world of film

jects. Berlin Alexanderplatz, a 15-
and-a—half hour film originally
made for German television by
Ranier Werner Fassbinder ran
to a near-sellout audience in
May, in spite of its challenging
length of four hours a night
over four consecutive nights.
Rauh described the films’
reception as, "a coup —— com-

mercially, financially and
artistically."
Rauh is equally excited

about a special he's running
this month. In addition to the
usual varied offerings which

will be shown in one of the’

Playhouse's two theatres, the
other will run 25 films, span-
ning SO years of -Katherine
Hepburn's career.

Rauh notes, "She'll be 75 on
October 8th, and has been
nominated 11 times for
academy awards (she's
received four). She wrote a let-
ter to me when she heard of
this festival. I'm displaying it in
the lobby."

Pittsburgh Filmmakers is

‘located on Atwood St., in the
shadow of the Pitt Law School.
Its proximity to the university
is no accident, since—Pitt offers

_ a number of film production

courses which are taught in_its'
labyrinth-like spaces. The
screening roo_m is a small room
at the top of a_ narrow stairwell
' and seats 169. The screen itself

' is laced’ onto a metal frame,

trampoline- style. .No frills
here. Pittsburgh Filmmakers is.
not out to woo suburbanites
away from their multi-screen
paradises. - '

Filmmakers began in ' the
early seventies on the North
Side and the flamboyant crea-
tivity of that period seems to

be remembered on the stair- . A

well wall of their current loca-
tion where a mural of a
larger-than-life woman with
swirling tresses engulfs the
entrance.

According to departing pro-
gram director Bill Boichel,
Filmmakers began .with the
purpose of encouraging inde-
pendent film ‘production in
Pittsburgh. They have since
become an occasional partner
with Carnegie Institute Film
Section. About half of their
funding comes from state and

federal agencies such as the _

National Endowment for the
Arts, the Pennsylvania Coun-

cil for the Arts and the Pitts-. '

burgh _Foundation. The other
half comes from admission .to
films as well as university tui-

ltion money.

dents who don't want to go see
Raiders of the Lost Ark at David

Lawrence or Clockwork Orange
at the Playhouse. We want to

‘show things that nobody else

is showing — things you just
can't see otherwise.”

"In our series we try to gear
our choices towards a social,

. psychological or historical

focus in film...film in context
and vice versa.,We were think-
ing of showing Olympiad this
summer [a 1936 propagandist
documentary commissioned
by Hitler] to show that film
now would be pertinent, first
because this summer we have
the «Olympics here, it's an elec-

tion year and we have Reagan .

in the White House...so there's
an interesting parallel.”

”Media is inextricably
plugged in to politics. And this
is the mindset we're dealing
with when we pick a film. We'll
take disparate‘ things, from the
whole of film history, and by
juxtaposing them, pull them
into a new context.”

The Pitt News Orientation Issue

Boichel has always estab-
lished a theme in his program-
ming that isn’t easily
recognizable to the uninitiated
viewer. Last year, for example,
a series of 50's films were
shown, many of them by Doug
Sirk, which appeared to be
melodramas at first inspec-
tion. The program sheets
handed out upon entering the
screening room made canny
observations about the Ameri-
can scene in the 50's. The
effect was to enhance the rele-
vance of the films —- to allow
the viewer to appreciate them
on different levels._

Additionally, Filmmakers
has brought influential,
offbeat filmmakers for presen-
tations and screenings. Boichel
spoke of Filmmakers next
coup.

"We're going to have Jack
Smith, a very influential film-
maker from the sixties. He
hasn't shown his films in 15
years, but he's coming here
September 21 and 22 for two
shows -— one here and one at

"We try to program for stu-
dents who don't want to see
Raiders of the Lost Ark at
David Lawrence.../'

—Bill Boichel

  Tuesday.

the museum.”

Filmmakers engenders a
very unself-conscious and
unpretentious love of cinema.
Boichel agrees with the Play-
house’s Rauh that his role in
the film community is one of
education and not revelation.
He just gets film and filmmak-
ers that more often that not
cause a spark —- and hopes the
combustion is contagious.

, Bill Judson oversees the
third venue for alternative
film viewing in Pittsburgh. A
film historian and Pitt profes-
sor, he curates the Film Sec-
tion of the Museum of Art,
Carnegie Institute. His offices
and one of their screening
rooms are located. in the aus-
terely magnificent Sarah

Scaife Museum.

"Virtually everything we
show is part of a series. They
may be films from the same
country, or the same director,
or from a specific film genre,”
Judson said.

Like Filmmakers, [where
Judson is on the board and
with whom he_does parallel
programming], the Film Sec-
tion of the Museum of Art
brings in directors to screen
and discuss their films. They
do these though, with a more
easily identifiable film histo-
rian bent and extensive pro-
gram notes prepared for each
screening that call attention to
aesthetic development, and
the cultural and artistic con-
text of the given film, with
respect to the whole of film
history. ' ‘ ‘

\

This fall, the Museum of Art

iwill show three programs

from. the Collective for Living
Cinema in New York. They'll
co-host Jack Smith with Pitts-
burgh Filmmakers, exhibiting

among other things his land-
mark film, Flaming Creatures. A
series of previously un- A

released Mexican films by the
director Luis Bunuel, along

with several films by expat-S

riated American Roman
Polanski.

In Judson’s view, having all
three facilities in town for
alternative viewing is abso-
lutely necessary, especially
with one of them having a
more commercially viable cast
to it. Each outlet fulfills a dis-
tinct function with little.
overlap. .\

There's no reason to be uni-
maginative in your film view-
ing this fall. Walk a few blocks,
and your choices multiply. Of
course, with these more
innovative film possibilities,
you run the small, but not neg-
ligible risk of...(whisper) learn-'
ing something...but that just

comes with the territory when V

you look for something more.
Happy viewing.
