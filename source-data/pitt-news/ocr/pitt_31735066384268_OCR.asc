SGB Election

Lash On, Garger Off Ballot

By RICH HARRY
Pitt News Staffwritei

Max Lash and Dave Garger have
met dissimilar fates in their bids to
secure ballot positions in the
upcoming Student Government
Board elections.

Lash and Garger were the two
board hopefulls initially‘ denied
ballot positions
when it was
learned that
each possibly , I
could graduate
before his board
term would ex-
pire in April
1979, thereby violating the Student
Government consitution and elec-
tion code.

After hearing brief testimony
from each candidate, the Student
Government Elections Committee
the .(SGE-C) has ruled Lash be
placed on the Jan. 18-19 ballot, and
that Garger be barred from running

oNew Department Head Named

‘N,

By TOM KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt Professor Robert Penny has
been named acting chairman of the
black studies department by
Faculty of Arts and Science Dean
Jerome Rosenberg, effective today.

Penny, an associate professor in
the department, replaces Curtiss
Porter, who resigned the chair-
manship last November, charging
Rosenberg and the University were
guilty of bias, discrimination and
interfering with department pro-
cedure.

Rosenberg indicated Penny
ywxlld remain acting chairman this
,,,,.I , while a search for a

permanent chairman is conducted
by faculty members.

“Mr. Penny was recommended
to me as acting chairman by the
faculty,” Rosenberg said. “He
was chosen by an overwhelming
consensus. He will remain
chairman until the end of the

summer. Ihope by that time, they

search for a permanent chairman
will be completed.”

Penny, who has been with the
department since it’s establish-
ment in 1969, will organize and
head a search committee for a
permanent chairman. Penny said
the search may be delayed until he

assumes the chair responsibilities
from Porter.

“As acting chairman,’ Penny
said last Friday, “I will organize

7

the search committee. The search ,

for a permanent chairman will
begin as soon as possible, but for
now, more important matters have
to be taken care of.”

Penny expressed an interest in
retaining the position permanently.

“Yes, I would like to be
permanent chairman,” Penny said,
“but a number of candidates will
be considered.”

Porter, who will continue teach-
ing in the department, suggested

(Continued on Page 3)

on the grounds his candidacy would
violate the rule in question.

The SGEC decision, made during
the ﬁnal exam period last month,
ﬁxes the number of SGB candi-
dates at 14.

Lash, a member of the Student
Government Allocations committee
and a co-chairman of last term’s

I I I I I I I I I Homecoming Committee, will join

ELPCTIEN

Jeff Barent and Josh Baylson as
candidates for SGB president.

Seeking the six board seats will
be Diane Behers, Scott Brown,
Stan Galanski, Dave Goldman,
Dave Hesidence, Jan Medoff, Sam
Medicine, Cheryl Moore, Bernie
Popko, Sharon Starzynski and Cleo
Sumpter.

July Berl, earlier announced as a
candidate, has withdrawn from the
race.

The SGI5.-C earlier had awarded
ballot positions to all candidates
but Lash and Garger. The elections
committee withheld a decision on
these two until it was guaranteed
the pair would be enrolled as

full-time undergraduates for at.

least one year after the SGB
election date.

Transcripts ﬁled to the SGEC by
Lash and Garger showed each had
enough credits to graduate before
his term of ofﬁce would expire.

Lash testiﬁed before the SGEC
that, throughout his ‘board tenure,
he would be enrolled for enough
credits to make him eligible. The
SGEC ruled in Lash’s favor after he
signed an oath binding him to the
requirement. A

Garger, a current board mem-
ber, followed with testimony that
he deﬁnitely would graduate at the
end of fall term this year.

“This deﬁnitely conflicts with
the requirement,” Garger told the

SGEC. “But I will live near Pitt,
and will be available all the time. I
will fulfill my obligations if
permitted to run.”

The SGE-C, however, ruled
against Garger, who unsuccessfully
appealed the decision.

"I'm deﬁnitely disapppointed,”
Garger said after the SGE-C vote.
“I wanted to contribute to Student
Government. Now, I have to ﬁnd
another way.”

Shapp Cuts
University's
State Funds

By MARK MURPHY
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt students and administrators
received an unwanted Christmas
present ‘during term break when
Gov. Milton J. Shapp slashed $1.2’
million from Pitt’s $61.7 million
approriation, as part of a $7.5
million cut involving nearly all of
the state-related institutions.

At the time of the reductions,
Chancellor Posvar called them
“bitterly disappointing and quite
unfair,” claiming a tuition hike and
program cuts were inevitable by

next fall because of the governor’s

actions. The chancellor could not
be reached for further comment on
a possible tuition hike.

Shapp made the cuts immediate-
ly before signing an appropriations.

Roderick Y. Curry Sr. IS the most recent person to bring charges

against Equitable Gas Company in connection with last January’s

responsibility for the incident.

Allegheny County coroner Cyril Wecht, during a two-day inquest last
February, determined that natural gas was the most probable cause of
the explosion. The coroner, however, could not determine the source of

the gas.

Pitt also has brought suit against Equitable in Common Pleas Court
for damage to books, desks and equipment. The University claims
Equitable was negligent by allowing gas to build up underground near

Langley’s lecture halls 221 and 223.

The suit says gas accumulated after leaking from ‘ ‘one or more holes,
breaks and/ or defects in one or both of the gas lines running running
down the eastern side of Tennyson Avenue.”

Pitt also says” the utility should have sealed off the untapped pipeline

Other lawsuits are expected.

Legislature hiked both personal
and corporate net income tax rates,
and cut millions of dollars in state
programs. Still, Shapp claimed, an
$18 million gap remained. He
closed it by cutting more programs

and reducing state aid to univer-J,
sities and institutions by $7.5

million.

University presidents, whose
colleges, already facing massive
loan repayments, all claimed the
reduction threw their schools
deeper into ﬁnancial bogs.

Temple University, which lost
$1.1 million, already has levied an
emergency $20 surcharge on all
tuition bills to winter term
students.

Penn STate President, John W.
Oswald, whose school "lost $2.2
million, called the cuts “a severe
blow,” adding, “Penn State has
been operating on a very austere
basis this fiscal year, and will find
it agonizingly difficult to absorb
this cutback.” Oswald said a
mid-year tution increase, at the
beginning of spring term, will have
to be considered seriously.

Perhaps the school hardest hit
was the University of Penn-
sylvania’-s School of Veterinary

WORK-STUDY PROGRAM
OFFI~lRED T0 VETS

The Ofﬁce of Special Student
Services ‘ is introducing, a new
work-study program for G.I. Bill
students at Pitt and is seeking
veteran-student candidates to ﬁll
the position, which will be available
this month.

This work-study program, spon-
sored by ther Veterans Administra-
tion, is designed to offset the small
number of University work-study
positions available during winter
term.

According to Kathleen Moore,
assistant to the director of the Office
of Special Student Services,
“We’ve opened these positions
because we realize how difficult it is
to ﬁnd a work-study job in January.
We’re hoping this program will
attract students who want to
alternate their winter class schedule
with actual work experience.”

Any veteran pursuing a program
or education or training under Title
38 U.S.C., Chapter 31 or 34 (the G.I.
Bill) at a full-time rate is potentially
eligible for the work-study pro-

gram.
Qualiﬁed veterans may earn up to

&‘ ' a maximum of $625 per term for 250

53

/'

 

hours of service. Veterans electing
to work less than 250 hours will be
paid at a rate of $2.50 per hour.
Payment for the ﬁrst 100 hours of
service‘ ($250) will be paid in
advance.

Included in this program are
clerical work-study positions at the
Veterans Administration Regional
Ofﬁce and veterans’ counselor
positions in the veterans’ affairs
division of the Ofﬁce of Special
Student Services. Interested
veterans should contact Kathleen
Moore at the Ofﬁce of Special
Student Services at 624-6500.

PITT SCIENTIST FINDS METEO-
RITES IN ANTARCTIC

Pitt geologist William Cassidy
found 21 meteorites while on a
recent expedition to Antartica.

According to the National
Science Foundation, there are only
2,000 meteorites in the world's
known collection. Cassidy, who
had been on a similar meteorite
expedition in 1977, advanced a
theory on the location of meteorites
that has been confirmed by his
latest ﬁnd.

According to NSF ofﬁcials, this is
the first time anyone has produced

an idea of where meteorites should
be found without actually seeing
them fall. Cassidy theorized the
meteorites would be located on
very old ice surfaces that had lost
their snow cover.

The Antarctic meteorites will be
sent to meteorite curating centers
in the U.S. and Japan for later
distribution to scientists.

“ 72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh’?

Axed Again =  

It seems there is no end to the legislative bludgeoning of Penn-
sylvania’s state-related university students and their families.
Gov. Shapp’s $18 million ax job on the educational appropriations
bill is the latest in a series of events that leave us wondering whether
there is any real future for higher education in this state.

The $1.2 million cut in,Pitt’s expected $61.7 million award is a

- serious step backward. In addition to steadily inflating operating

costs, Pitt must pay several thousand dollars in accrued interest on
loans taken out to cover expenses during the Legislature’s long
vacation from political responsibility. The result undoubtedly will
be tuition hikes invthe fall at a school that is already the third most
expensive state-related university in the country.

It is small comfort that Temple and Penn State, also in the in-
famous top five, are faced with the same situation. It is downright
disturbing that the continued existence of Penn’s School of
Veterinary Medicine, the only school of its kind in the state, has
been placed in jeopardy by -these most recent cuts.

At this point, to document the activities of individual lawmakers
responsible for the unhappy turn of events would take several
pages; the maneuverings in Harrisburg have been that complicated.
it shouldlnot be missed, however, that our elected officials clearly

have. placed personal
education in Pennsylvania.

Lavelle: Banking on the B|ockCommuni’ry     g

By GARY GOVERT

Robert R; ,Lavelle, 62, has been a
prominent and active member of Pitts-
burgh’s black community for several
years. In 1968, he gained national at-
tention when he won a settlement in
federal district court that made hint the
first black admitted to ttterttbbrship in
‘Greater, East End Multilist, Inc, a
realtors ’ cooperative that lists properties
forgsale in a cotnmo_n pool. Multilist

I ‘twice rejected Lavel/e’s application for
‘membership in I 965; the settlement

followed an antitrust suit filed in April

Z1967, charging the group with racial

discrimination.

In addition to his work as President
ofLavelle Real Estate, lnc., Lavelle has
served as Chairman of the NAACP’s
Personnel Committee, and is presently
on the Board of Directors of Pittsburgh
Theological Seminary. For more than
20 years, he also has been the executive
vice president and-s_ecretar_v of Dwelling
House Savings and ‘Loan, a somewhat
unorthodox banking’ institution on the
corner of.Herron and Centre A venues in
the Hill District. P

I recently spoke to Lavelle about
Dwelling House and about some of the
problems and opportunities facing the
inner city black communit_v:

VGOVERT: What makes Dwelling
House different from the general,
run-of-the-mill savings and loan?

LAVELLE: Dwelling House
exists to do what needs to be done

- for poor and black communities.

This means we usually get marginal
loans. Everyone wants to adhere to
the rule that says you lend at the
highest rate you can get and at the
lowest risk you can take. That is the

political considerations above higher

primary banking rule in this
country- But in the instance of
Dwelling House, if you lend to the
needs of people, it means you might
be taking the greatest risk at the
lowest return. .

Q: Why is there aneed to do this?

A: The capitalistic system that
we are a part of is primarily a system
of greed. You are alwaysreading
and hearing about growth and

l proﬁt. You need growth and proﬁt

if you are going to survive, but this
becomes the god of business.
Everything is measured in terms of
growth and proﬁt, withoutregard to
whether the institution is serving
the needs of the public that makes it
possible for the institution to exist.
When the system says we’re going
to lend at the highest rate we can get
at the lowest risk we can take, that’s
very prudent economic reasoning.
But under that system, the poor
people can never get the loan, and
neither can the black people. Oh,
there are some blacks who can
afford it, but those blacks usually
don’t identify with blacks who
cannot. The economic class system
obtains there. Everyone is aspiring
to be part of the people who
“have”—to get out of the “have
not” class. That’s ﬁne; everyone
should. But being one of the
“haves” means we have the
responsibility to serve the needs of
those who have less than we do.

Q: How much does Dwelling
House deviate from its‘ “soft loan”
policy?

A: It doesn’t. But we encourage
and hope for the good loans. When

Letters To The Editor

Middle East Peace

It is both surprising and amusing.
to realize that the Anti-Imperialist
Student Union, to use its own
words, “are imperialist fascist
running-dog war mongerers. ’ ’ This
may seem like an undue exaggera-
tion, but in her beratement of the

I Sadat-Begin peace initiative, Julie

Graham not only denounced the
attempt at a" rapprochement, but
actually called for another Mid-East
war.

Contrary to what the Anti-Imper-
ialists may believe, peace in the
Middle" East is long overdue.
Without a doubt, the people, as they
frequently are called, want less war
and more health. In Egypt,
according to Newsweek, the
per-capita income will buy only a
few shells for a tan_k’s cannon, and
social services are buckling beneath
the strain of the population growth.
No one knows this better than
Sadat, who said that he must ‘ ‘try to
save my Egyptian people and the
entire Arab nation from the horrors

a person comes to us, he gets
service, whether he is affluent or
low-income. We have some loans to
people who don’t need to come to
Dwelling House for their loans, just
like we have their savings—people
who could put their money
somewhere else at a higher rate.
We appreciate the opportunity to

have both ends. I readrecently that‘ ‘

the mortgage delinquency rate is

consistently running aroundj three 

percent at most lending institu-.
tions. Well, if they’d called

Dwelling House, I’d have toldlthelm H is
our delinquency rate might run as

high as 30 percent. Our ‘foreclosure
rate is about the same as those
institutions who take only the safe
loans because we take the time to
encourage the person, exhort him,

. hold his hand, tell him to do what he

said he was going to when he got his
loan. We keep reemphasizing that
self-respect is at stake. But we need
people we’re not going to have to do
that with. . A ,

Q: What kind of inﬂuence has
Dwelling House had in the Hill
District, and what do you see as
your future role?

A:
ownership in the Hill District has
increased from 12 or 14 percent 15
years ago to maybe 35 percent now.
Home ownership helps .to bring
about quality schools, quality
government services, good garbage
collection, and police who protect
instead of exploit. Home ownership
brings about the need‘ for busi-
nesses in a community, and these
businesses provide the goods and
services for a community, as well as
employment. These businesses
provide kids the opportunity to see
legal businesses in their community
instead of dope and numbers and
prostitution and loan sharks and
alcohol, and that’s all the economics
of a community is without a lending
institution willing to lend money
back into the community to expand
it.

Q: The government, particularly
the Department of Housing and
Urban Development, lately has
been kicking around the idea of an
urban development hankw-as new
federal agency-—-designed to make
loans to businesses and programs in
the cities. What do you think of the
idea?

I would say that home‘

of new, shocking and destructive
wars.”

But far more signiﬁcant than a
possible ‘ bilateral settlement be-
tween Egypt and Israel is that this
peace initiative has opened the door
for others to follow. King Hussein
clearly would like to follow Sadat in
opening negotiations to win back his
lost territory on the West Bank.
Begin, in turn, has stated he is more
than ready to enter into negotiations
with Jordan at any time. Even more
surprising is that Syria, a perennial
hard-liner, refused to endorse an
Iraqi “no peace” resolution at the
rejectionist conference in Tripoli.
None of this" would have happened
so quickly without the Sadat-Begin
initiative. As Jordanian Informa-
tion Minister Adnan Abu Odeh
said, the Sadat visit “accomplished
its aims and melted the snow. by

removing the psychological barriers '

between Arabs and Israelis.”
The mood set by the Sadat visit
also has affected thevlsraelis. Begin

A: I don’t think very much of it.
People have a tendency to think of
government as the answer to their
problems, but government only
seeks to perpetrate itself and its
programs.
ment program comes into being,
ostensibly to help some situation in
the public, that government. pro-
gram (eventually) becomes a

perpetuator of . its. -own -existence, -

and doesn’t‘ carewhether it
achieves its purpose. E An urban

bank isythe last thing we need if
-‘we’re going to talk about being a

free society. ”I have written to
Presidents Carter, Nixon, and Ford,
asking them about the possibilitygof
the government making deposits
with any banking institution that
will take them, deposits that will
pay the government interest.

vMoney deposited in these institu-

tions would be used to lend back to
people who need it at an interest
rate the people can afford to pay,
allowing a, spread of about two
percent for the bank or savings and
loan that would handle this money
in‘ order I to cover operational
expenses, reserve requirement and
bad debts. You don’t need to set up
a government bank to do this. You
already have the expertise in
private banks, the personnel_to do
it, and thew understanding and
knowledge of where the people are.
Unfortunately, there aren’t any
laws to permit doing this. But laws
are made for Mellon. Bank and
Chase Manhattan, so why aren’t
they made? to meet the needs of a

poor person without having to

involve a government agency?

* What better than the bank on the

corner, where the people are, to do

. this? When we say the government

should do it, we’re trying to push it
away from us, we’re trying to make
some institution responsible, which
allows us to avoid our individual
responsibility; and that’s what is
wrong with us as a society.

Q: What can the new city
administration do to iinprove
conditions in the Hill District?

A: The best police in the city
should be in the Hill. By the 't.~s:.v,-1,
police I mean the police who have a
feeling of security as to who tliey 
as individuals, so they won‘t have to
use their authority to lord it over

Whenever a govern- .

was very pleased with the rapport
he established with the Egyptian
president, and even the most
“hawkish” of Israeli politicians
conceded the time had come to
reevaluate their positions.‘ As
Yehuda Ben-Meir, a leader of the
hardline National Religious Party,
said, “We’re faced with a new
political situation, and we’ll have to
be ready to compromise.”

The prospects for peace in the
Middle East have never been
better, and the involved nations
seerp to be willing to sit down and
negotiate. For the Arab nations that
have refused to recognize lsrael’s
existence over the past 30 years,
this is both novel and encouraging.
It is unfortunate that the thought of
a settlement in the Middle East
upsets Julie Graham. As for the
rest of us, we realize quite well that
peace is a good idea.

Nir Kossovsky

those who have nothing. What
really needs to be done by the city,
by any-administration, is to see that
those who have the least are getting
the best and the most of the
services.

Q: Are federal jobs programs a
good answer to unemployment in
thg city?

A: Not a goodanswer. It. may be
expedient, temporarily. No federal‘
jobs‘ program is any good. The only

' jobs that are any good are

industrial, private jobs that create
jobs, that make it possible for work
to be productively constructive in
the life of a person, that allow him to

~ achieve and to rise higher and to be

doing something that’s productive
and meaningful in the life of
someone else. This isn’t true of
government V jobs; they’re make-
work. Once we set up an agency, it
becomesanother structure between
the government and the person’s
ability to rise. The agency holds
himdown. i .
Q. Jesse Jackson says that blacks
are the only people who can or w
do anything about black people’s
problems. Do you agree? -

A: Unfortunately, yes. But when
I say that, there’s a’ risk of being
misunderstood. The only way
change is going to come about for
anybody, including black people, is
that they change themselves. The
ultimate responsibility begins with
every individual. Nobody is going
to give up power. An individual has
to take power for himself. He takes

it by being willing to pay the price_ 7\
for it. The price a black. person has 9'

to pay is willingness to support
another black person. A ‘black
businessman must do whatever has
to be done to raise the economic
level of the black community, the
psychological‘consciousness of the
black person. That’s why I’m in the
black community. ‘

One has to take the time, pay the
price of inconvenience and pay the
economic price, to support black
people who are struggling to get a
pi:-‘:u:‘ of thc pic. The price is

JACKSONVILLE, Fla.—Don’t
mention Jacksonville and New
Orleans in the same breath.
Comparing the entertainment
potential of the two cities is like
comparing the tastes of sugar and
salt in your morning coffee. To the
Pitt football team, whose recent
Gator Bowl trip to the chilly
oceanfront at Jacksonville Beach
replaced last year’s Sugar Bowl
experience in New Orleans, truer
words never have been spoken.

“You can’t compare Jacksonville
with the New Orleans night life,”
said defensive back Scott McKee1,
on day eight of the team’s >10-day
stay. “The late curfews we have
‘don’t matter, because there’s
nothing to do anyway.”

True, players were seen wander-
ing around the hotel lobby at
relatively early hours of the night,
and it even is rumoured many
paired up for nightly chess matches
before they turned in. But
die-hards like sophomore Kurt
Brechbill were able to make the best
of the situation. Brechbill’s

activities included a motorcycle

cruise and a ride on the waves on his
newly-purchased surfboard.

“The guy wanted $45 for it, but I
got him down to $30,” boasted the

J Page 6——TH E‘ PliTT7NiEWS—iMondaiy; January 9, I978 »

 Pitt Plight: Cold Seashore, Boredo m,

6-2, 245-pound offensive tackle.

Brechbill’s dickering success
could be attributed to the uncom-
monly cold Jacksonville weather,
which averaged in the mid-40’s
during the team’s visit and quickly
erased Jacksonville’s lone advant-
age over Bourbon Street—the
beach.

“Sure, we were disappointed
when we came down here and saw
how cold it was,” said Glenn
Meyer, a member of Pitt’s kamikaze
(speckdg'teanu9 squad. “VVhen
we get back home, we’l1 think it was
hot, but right now it’s kind of cold.”

Cold or not, many of the players,
who were joined later in the week by
band members and other visiting
Pittsburghers, lined the beach
outside the players’ hotel and took
an occassional quick (very quick)
dip in the ocean. Maybe they heard
a Jacksonville weather announcer,
who tried to console the out-of-
towners with a chamber of
commerce pitch, saying the weather
was indeed warmer than back
home. Whatever the reason,
sloshing around in the water was
one sure way to distinguish
Pittsburghers from native Florid-
ians.

“They must be from Pitts-
burgh,” said Florida Junior College
coed Penny Parker, pointing to the

swimmers. “We wouldn't think of
going in at this time of the year. It’ s
too cold.

For a person who admits to never
seeing snow, Penny wasbrave in‘
deﬁning the word cold. But she did
have the nightlife scene down to a
tee; except for a few discoteques
located 10 miles from the hotel, the
best available option was to go
bowling-, she said.

“Other than that,” she drawled,
”there’s not much to do around
here.”

The team did have an itinerary,
however, that was enough to keep
the players from climbing the walls.
A Marineland and gator farm tour,
along with a night at the dog races,
highlighted the slate of events-—but
somehow, it just wasn’t the same as
New Orleans.

“The biggest difference between
Jacksonville and New Orleans,”
said McI(eel, a kamikaze squad
demon, ”is that when we were in
New Orleans, Ididn’t want to leave.
Now, I can’t wait to go home.”

Another weary Pittsburgher
echoed McKeel’s sentiments in the
hotel lobby on the night before‘ the
game.

“Yeah,” he said with a bored
expression, “it sure ain’t New
Orleans down here. It ain’t even
Pittsburgh. ”

 

Defensive line coach Bob Matey decided to try his hand at kayaking.__

Eastwood Runs “The Gauntlet” in New Film 

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News §taffWriter
The Gauntlet
Directed by Clint Eastwood

There is a stock formula
actor-director Clint Eastwood uses
in all of T his movies—terse
dialogue, fast women, and lots of
gory violence. Sometimes, the
picture is redeemed by the plot
(“Dirty Harry”) or by the acting
(costar Jeff Bridges copped an
Oscar nomination for “Thunderbolt
and Lightfoot”). Eastwood’s
offering, “The Gauntlet,” has no
such saving features.

Eastwood portrays Ben Shock-

Cavanaugh Exits With a Bang--Shatters Gator Mark

’ By JIM PANE
‘ Pitt News Staff Writer

JACKSONVILLE, FLA.— -“Matt Cavanaugh must have
thrown two miles against us,” said Clemson coach Charley
Pell, after his Tigers were humbled by Pitt, 34-3, in the 33rd
annual Gator Bowl.

“Super quarterback,” Pell added. “I’m very impressed
with him.”

Though it didn’t quite add up to two miles, a record Gator
Bowl crowd of 72,289 witnessed an awesome aerial display
that fell only 14 yards short of an NCAA milestone for passing
yardage. Cavanaugh did manage to shatter school and Gator
Bowl records, however, as he ended his college career with a

_ ﬂurry.

‘ ‘We knew Matt was getting close to a couple of records, so
(offensive coordinator) Bob Leahy and I decided to keep him
in there/7 Pitt coach Jackie Sherrill explained. “We felt he
deserved it. He’s sacriﬁced a lot for me.”

Cavanaugh’s ﬁnal stat sheet totaled 23 completions in 36
attempts for a record 387 yards and four touchdowns. An
additional 15 yards rushing provided the senior ﬁeld general
with one more record—-a Gator Bowl mark * of 402 total
offensive yards.

Unlike his Clemson counterpart Steve Fuller, who was
named Atlantic Coast Conference player of the year,
Cavanaugh had all day to ﬁnd open receivers, and responded
by spreading the wealth to ﬁve different targets. Running
backs Elliot Walker (6) and Fred Jacobs (1), along with
receivers Gordon Jones (10), Randy Reutershan (5) and

Willie Taylor (1) all contributed, as the Panthers won their
third straight bowl game and raised their season record to
9-2-1.

Walker, who pulled in scoring strikes of 39, 10 and 25
yards, added 53 yards on the ground to surpass the
1,000-yard mark for the year, making him the only Panther
besides Tony Dorsett ever to do so.

The 10 snares by Jones netted 163 yards and one
touchdown. Inthe process, Cavanaugh’s favorite receiver set
Pitt season records of 793 total receiving yards and nine
scores.

‘ ‘I was surprised to see they gave me as much slack as they
did," Jones remarkediafter the game. “There wasn’t as
much double coverage as I expected.

“But Matt is something else,” he continued. “I didn’t
have anything to worry about, because I knew that if I got
open, the ball would be there.”

Cavanaugh is equally impressed with the junior pass
catcher from North Versailles, Pa.

V ‘ ‘Gordon is one of the best receivers in the nation,”
Cavanaugh offered. ‘ ‘I’l1 be playing with a lot of receivers in
the Senior Bowl, and they’re going to have to show me a lot to
equal Gordon’s ability.”

Sherrill, who was reminded that Cavanaugh had thrown his
last pass in a Panther uniform, found consolation by
embracing Jones and remarking, “I got this one back for
another year, though.”

While it quickly has become a fad to compare last year’s
championship team with this year s squad. Cavanaugh “'35
asked to contribute to the analysis.

“There's no comparison,” he said. “We worked with one
guy last year and it worked for us, but this year we utilized our
personnel more fully. We were more explosive this year.”

Much of that explosiveness can be traced back to the
bazooka arm of Matt Cavanaugh, who ended the season with
the highest average gain per pass play of any quarterback in
the country. More than 70,000 in the Gator Bowl and a
national television audience had just witnessed why.

“Tonight, you saw what number 12 is_all about,” Sherrill
said. ‘-‘And he’s still not healthy. I shudder to think what he
could have done had he stayed healthy.”

Heavensl With a healthy Matt Cavanaugh in the lineup,
that Temple game back in September might have ended
176-0.

BOWL NOTES: Mark Schubert's two ﬁeld goals tied a
Gator Bowl record for most in a game, while Clemson's Obed
Arirfs’ 49-yarder set a distance record...'I'he Panthers
haven t allowed a ﬁrst-quarter touchdown in 13 consecutive

GW Accepts Pitt Gift, 73-71  

By BOB LABRIOLA
Pm News Staff Writer

The gift-giving season supposed-
ly ended two weeks ago, but the Pitt
Panthers extended a belated
Christmas gift to George Washing-
ton, bowing in the ﬁnal seconds,
73-71, yesterday at the Field House.

The Colonials, battling back from
as much as an eight-point Panther
cushion in the second half, took
their only lead of the afternoon on a
last-second layup by sophomore
Bucky ‘Roman.
- ..With- 49* seconds remaining in the

game, Pitt was in possession of the

ball with the score deadlocked at 71.
The Panthers went into their
four-corners offense’ to draw the
Colonials out of their zone defense
and work for the last shot of the
game. With under ten seconds left,
Pete Strickland had the ball knocked
loose by Roman. Tom Tate scooped
up the loose ball and tried to get a
pass off that was batted in the air by
Strickland. GW’s Bob Lindsay
retrieved the ball and sent a long
pass to Roman who broke for the
hoop after the ball popped free. His
layup trickled through the basket
with only one tick left on the
scoreboard clock, sending the
Colonial contingent into a state of
euphoria, while the majority of the

’ 3,811 fans ‘in attendance sat in

stunned silence.

“We wanted to run the clock
down to'around 15 seconds, and
then work for_the last shot,” Pitt

coach Tim Grgurich said. “If they

were in a zone, we would have gone

with our zone offense, and if they

were in a man-to-man’ defense,
we’d try to set a double screen for

Larry (Harris) and then go from
there.” ’

Across thelocker room, Colonial
coach Bob Tallent had the look of a
six-year-old on Christmas morning.

“We were looking for a steal
when there were about 20 seconds
left in the game,” Tallent said.
“We didn’t want to wait until they
took the last shot because then the
best we could have done was a tie. I
was kind of surprised Pitt waited so
long to move the ball to the hoop. I
ﬁgured they might try to come right

down the court and score.”

Although the fatal blow was not
delivered until the ﬁnal second, the
Panthers had numerous opportuni-
ties to put the Colonials away
throughout the contest.

Pitt jumped out to a 16-7 lead
after the ﬁrst six minutes of play,
keeping GW far away from the hoop
with a zone defense, controlling the
backboards and executing a deadly
fast break.

The Panthers then hit a cold
streak, going nearly four and a half
minutes without a basket, enabling
the Colonials to climb back into the
game, 19-17. The rest of the half
had Pitt gradually rebuilding its
lead with GW making periodic runs
at the Panthers to close the gap.
The half ended with Pitt on top,
41-35. a

Each time Pitt threatened to run
away from GW in the second half,
something would happen to allow

the Colonials to battle back into the
game. .

With 12:51 left in the game,
Harris was forced to the bench with
his fourth foul; Terry Knight

followed him two minutes later.

With the Panthers leading by
four, 55-51, with nearly 10 minutes
to play, Sam Clancy was called for a
technical for hanging on the rim
after a backboard-rattling slam.
GW converted the technical, got the
ball out of bounds and added a
basket.

Pitt led by seven, 62-57, when
Bob Haygood was called (for
charging on a fast break opportunity
that would have extended the lead
as well as. keeping the momemtum
in Pitt’s favor. After the opening
minutes of the game, the Panthers
had a poor conversion percentage
on their ‘fast break opportunities.

“Our fast break was there all
afternoon, but we couldn’t put the
ball in the hole when we had to,”
Grgurich said. “We must have had
20 opportunities and all we seemed
to be getting out of it were charging
fouls.”

In the final ﬁve minutes of the
game, the Colonials outscored the
Panthers, 16-9, setting the stage for
the ﬁnal confusing seconds.

“Our biggest adjustment came at
halftime when we decided to go to
our zone offense,” Tallent explain-
ed. “In the ﬁrst half, Pitt’s zone
was giving us a lot of trouble,
keeping us outside and forcing

longer shots than we usually like to

take. After we started getting the
ball inside to Zagardo and Glenn,
we were able to close the gap.”
“We blew it,” Grgurich said.
“We have no one to blame but
ourselves.” A sad, but accurate
assessment of the game.

Vocal Clemson Fans Paint Jacksonville Orange

JACKSONVILLE, Fla.——Call it
home-ﬁeld advantage hundreds of
miles from home. Clemson fans,
who waited 18 years for their
Fighting Tigers L0 enter into
post-season play. numbered at least
double their 25,000-ticked allot-
ment, and made their boisterous
prescence known in front of a
national television audience at the
33rd annual Gator Bowl.

Bedecked in Clemson orange,
Tiger followers congregated in the
Gator Bowl parking lots as early as
seven hours before kickoff. in
anticipation of the clash between
Pitt’s bowl-veteran Panthers and
Clemson Coach Charley Pell's

Angels. The ‘Orange Crush’
paraphernalia ranged from orange
support hose to orange overalls to
orange painted tiger paws on the
cheeks and noses’ of thousands
of Tiger-crazy fans.

Clemson offensive lineman Dar-
rell Misenheimer went as far as to
have the hair on his head shaved to
form a tiger print.

A pretty senile group, wouldn’t
you say? Maybe hungry would be a
better word to describe these
Clemsonites. whose post-season
drought was becoming monoton-
ous. Eighteen years is longer than
they would care to admit to, and
bowl aspirations seemed out of the
question even at the start of this
season.

Then came Bell, who took over.

th‘e coaching chores of a football
team addicted to losing. Five-time
winners _during the past two years,
the Tigers were anemic at best. But
Pell turned the football program
around, and Clemson‘ ﬁnished the
1977 regular season with an 8-2-1

‘record——good enough for the

runner-up spot in the Atlantic Coast
Conference. From there, Pell and
his Cinderella team rode the
pumpkin coach into theGator Bowl
to meet the reigning national
champions of college football face to
face.

And the fans were ready.
Equipped with a list of cheers and
high spirits, Tiger rooters filled the
stadium with enough orange to

make the Denver Broncos proud.
Although they were generally
better behaved than the Georgia
following Pitt encountered at last
year's Sugar Bowl, there was no
question as to their partiality. The
Gator Bowl erupted with choruses
of“Tiger Meat!” before kickoff, as
each Panther in the starting lineup
was introduced.

Throughout the raving display
put on by the Clemson rooters, the
12,000 or so Pitt fans sat
inconspicuously in their own little
corner of the stadium, trying their
darndest to cancel out the
0pp0sition’s wind. But, as they
were out-manned five to one, it
would have been easier to outyell an
SST.

In all, Clemson fans put on quite a

Panthers Open Eyes  With Rout of at Clemson

The television audience then was treated I0 {W0
more renditions of “Star Wars”; this total disdain
for creativity shattered the record for unimaginative
halftime shows set in 1976, when American flags and
“God Bless America” topped the charts. After
Woody Hayes retires as a football coach, he can use
the imagination shown in Ohio State’s offense to
become a top-flight band director in the Big Ten.

ABC-TV’s announcers, Keith Jackson and Frank
Broyles, did a commendable, job, but lost some
credibility in trying to divide their favorable com-
ments equally between the two teams even after the
game had been decided.

Broyles, former Arkansas coach and color com-
mentator, was impressed that Jackie Sherrill played
an average of 61 players per game, while starting as
many as seven freshmen at a time. i

“The alumni are worried about where the team is
ranked in the polls,” Broyles observed, “but the way

  

Defensively, Pitt did virtually nothing wrong,
shutting down Clemson’s offense while intercepting
four passes (Fuller had thrown only four intercep-
tions the entire season). On one of the few occasions
the Tigers threatened to score, Fuller thoughtrhe had
Butler free around the goal line (Broyles also was
fooled, calling Butler “wide open”), but Bob Jury
read the quarterback perfectly and made the inter-
ception.

The Panther pass rush was a force to be reckoned
with all evening, forcing Fuller to release the ball
before he wanted to in crucial situations. Pitt had

do nothing but enhance the reputation of the Univer-

_sity.

Elliott Walker provided what little second—half
excitement there was, showing the ball to two Clem-
son defenders before crossing the goal line en route
to his third touchdown of the night. In the broadcast
booth, Jackson in effect labeled Walker a hotdog,
while Broyles pointed out many things happen in a
game that go unnoticed, provoking incidents such as
Walker’s. Walker never has distinguished himself as
a hotdog, so it is likely he was reacting to something
that happened during the game. In this light, the in-
cident becomes understandable and even enjoyable.
and even enjoyable.

Sherrill may not have been able to repay Clemson
coach Charley Pell for the knots inflicted on the Pan-
ther coach’s head when the two played football at
Alabama, but Pell should remember the lumps he
received in his first bowl appearance for at least as
long as Sherrill remembered those knots.

And then there is Strickland. The
junior, playing against a school that

It all happened quickly. Working

who shoveled it to Bucky Roman,
who lad _it in despite a Sonny Lewis
block attempt. '

While that tells one how Pitt lost
it doesn’t tell one why they lost.

Pitt star Larry Harris notched
only 12 points, five below his

1 average, and hit only 5 of 15 from
the field. a poor showing for the
smootli-shooting senior. Terry
Knight and Wayne Williams
combined for only 14 points on the
afternoon, and Tim Grgurich needs
more scoring production’ from that
pair in the future. The Panthers
also missed six foul shots. These
factors contributed heavily, aside

. from the last-second blunder, to
send Pitt crashing to its fourth
defeat against six wins.

On the positive side were tlic ‘ﬁrm:
performaiices of San Clancy. Lewis

. He also had the ball stolen from
him in the last 10 seconds, which
most people are going to remember
a lot longer than the positive
contributions he made.

Strickland no longer seems
hesitant to take the 15- to 20-foot
shot when it's open, thus keeping
opposing teams honest on defense,
and helping wingman Harris get
more open shots against the zone. 1; ‘* 

“I have a lot more conﬁdence in 3
my shot, and it seems to be open,"
Strickland said. If I have it I’m
going to take it——I’m cheating my
teammates ifl don’t. If I don’t,
they'll just double ‘up on someone
else.

“We had a 7-point lead (62-55
with 5:56 remaining) and blew it,”
the Maryland native continued.

“GW got the ball inside to the big
guys, and when you do that you
deserve to win.  

“It reminds me of our West
Virginia game (a 71-66 Panther
win). We were behind the whole
game. and pulled it out at the end.
That is what they did to us today.
What can you say? It’s“one ofthose
things."

One of those things may end up
costing Pitt a great deal when

Sports at the University--A Review and a Preview

What '_,‘v()u missed (besides p/1.VSI'(‘S finals and
Oakland parking) during the past few weeks, and
what you’ll be reading about here in the coming few
weeks:

...the Pitt footb.all team’s first outstanding per-
formance of the season, which you may not have
ntissed, since it came against a decent but out-
classed Clemson team in one of tl1e year‘s better bowl
games. it was a great night for Matt Cavanaugh,
Elliott Walker, Gordon Jones, the defense and,
especially, Jackie Sherrill, who for the first time all
season could meet reporters after a big game and not
start by apologi/.ing.

_....the last performance of any kind at Pitt by Bob
Leahy, one of Sherrill’s pair of assislaltls, with whom
the Pitt head coach had differences that evolvedinto
ptiblic problems. In most cases of serious
disagreement between head coach and assistant, the
top man usually remains quiet until the end of the
season then announces how happy he is that coach
Whomeyer has landed the offensive coordinator’s
position at Our Lady of the Lace High. But when
Sherrill and Otto Stowe, who was making more

money ($5(),()()() yearly) for doing nothiitg (because of

a ridiculous pro contract coupled with a bum knee)
than he was eartting for coaching Pitt’s receivers

earlier in the season, disagreed on the matter of how

much time a receiver coaclt should spend with his
charges, Sherrill told Stowe to enjoy his Miami-sent
tnonc_v somewhere else.

And after Leahy and Sherrill argued over the
frequency with which Pitt should employ the wish-

...the Pitt basketball team’s emergence as a better-
than-average outfit on more than paper. Again, you
may not have missed this one, since the Field House
was jammed when the Panthers came from behind to
win a big one against West Virginia Wednesday
i1igl1t. Tim Grgurich’s season-long choice of players
finally was rewarded when Pete Strickland hit the
middle-range jumper that had to go in if Pitt was to
win a close one. And Grgurich’s two talented
“problems,” Larry Harris and Sonny Lewis, without
whom Pitt is crippled, seem to be putting off—the-
court dift'et‘ei1ces with Cirgurich aside and, at times
playing the excellent basketball to which Pitt fans
had grown accustomed.

...the serious consideration some of Pitt’s better

basketball players (all have started often during the
past two seasons) have given to trading their blue and
-gold fora redshirt and another set of colors. More

talked about it privately; one told a reporter from a
daily, ‘‘I don't know,” when asked if he was leaving,
and another said he’s already gone. ’

...Jackie Sherrill’s ever-quickening chase of high
school talent, which falls in these categories, in this
order: 1) linemen, especially offensive linemen,
unable to fit into a Tower C room, 2) quarterbacks
able to throw (and play) as freshmen, and 3) anyone
able to do anything else with a football that might
help Pitgt stay reasonably close to the top.

...Sam Clancy’s thundering arrival as Pitt’s best
freshman basketball player ever. Clancy’s major
problem, now that he’s getting some help under the
boards, will be fatigue, not ability or performance. '-

Things You Always Wanted to Know About Pitt Football 0  

Trivia and some not so trivial thoughts compiled
by a reporter who has had the privilege to cover the
1977 Pitt football team’ during its Gator Bowl-
capped season: .

Pitt sophomore halfback “Fast Freddie” Jacobs
gained 2,000 yards in his senior year at Wyoming
High School in Cincinnati, Ohio. With statistics like
those, it’s a wonder Ohio State head coach Woody
Hayes let the all-State halfback slip out of the state.
The way Jacobs darts off tackle reminds me of
another‘ good Ohio schoolboy star and Ohio State
graduate——two-time Heisman Trophy winner Archie
Griffin.

When Matt Cavanaugh broke his wrist against
Notre Dame, a few people probably thought about
using panther junior defensive end Dave DiCiccio at
quarterback. DiCiccio was an All—State quarterback
at Midland (Pa.) High School four’ years ago. “l
thought about it,” DiCiccio said at the time of
Cavanaugh’s injury.

Look-alikes—Pitt linebacker Jeff Pelusi and ex-
Chicago Bear great Dick Butkus.

Pitt’s not going to be as weakened in the defensive
secondary next season as people might like to think.
Although the Panthers will lose all-America safety
Bob Jury, LeRoy Felder and J. C. Wilson, Panther
defensive backfield coach Larry Holton will welcome
back some good people—namely, Mike Balzer,
Willie Mai sh and freshman Lynn Thomas.

With his personal problems and ankle miseries
aside, Pitt junioi Dave Logan could very well be a
legitimate all-America candidate next yearat middle
guard. Pro scouts already are taking a look at the
cat-quick junior from Pittsburgh’s Peabody‘High
School.

The Panthers shouldn’t complain about the defen-
sive line being a weakness for the next few years.
Besides third team all-America defensive end Hugh
Green. four other freshman-—(‘-reg Meisner, Steve

Fedell, Bill Neill and Jerry Boyarsky—saw a con-
siderable amount of playing time for the Panthers
this past campaign.

 

The Green Bay packers, who are in special need of
a good, intelligent defensive back, are taking long,
hard looks at both Bob Jury and, not so suprisingly,
former Panther quarterback Robert Haygood.
Haygood, now a member of the Pitt basketball team,
could be a real sleeper in the National Football
League draft this Spring. Already, Pitt basketball
coach Tim Grgurich has called the hard-working
Georgian one of the finest all-around athletes ever
produced.

Looking ahead——the Dallas Cowboys are keeping a
special eye on Panther junior wide receiver Gordon
Jones. Cowboys’ general managers Gil Brandt, a
frequent visitor to the press box at Pitt Stadium
during Panther home games this past season and one
of the men responsible for the deal that brought
Tony Dorsett to Dallas, wouldn’t mind seeing Jones
in the Cowboys’ metallic blue within the next few
years. “He’s one of the most exciting football
players in the country today,” Brandt said.

The Pitt coaching staff rates junior center Walt
Brown the best long snapper in either college or pro
football today. With the importance pro football
people place on special teams play today, Brown
could be worth a draft choice in next year’s college

drafr

It was surprising to see Pitt go with the wishbone in
the later stages of its 34-3 Gator Bowl win over Clem-
mn, The wishboned’-shapend toriiiatioii, with
mphomorc fullback Steve Harris inserted as the tip-
back in front of halfbacks Rooster Jones and Artrell
Hawkins, did the job for the Panthers. Running out
of the formation, backup quarterback Rick Trocano
was stopped short of yet another Pitt touchdown, in
the dying seconds of the game.

A special salute to the Pitt offensive line—the job
it did to transform what some thought at the begin-
ning of the season to be a weak spot into one of the
stronger points on the Pitt team was one of the many
success stories on this year’s squad.

It seems kind of unfair that Rick Trocano has got-
ten a good run-bad pass rep as quarterback. People
seem to have forgotten that the freshman quarter-
back from Cleveland, Ohio wasn’t given much of a
chance to put the ball in the air when he replaced the
injured Cavanaugh early in the season. With
Cavanaugh Oul and Trocano in, the Panthers went to
a simplified, run-oriented offense that didn’t give
Trocano that many opportunities to pass.

JoJo Heath and Rooster Jones, if given the chance
to show their stuff on a full-tinie basis, could be two
of the most exciting players in college football today.
Incidentally, Heath, who was the nation’s leading
punt returner earlier this season, finished as number
12. i 

A real trivia piece de resistance; who has the
biggest shoe size on the ’77 Pitt football team? That
honor goes to freshman offensive lineman Mark
May. The 6-5, 270—pound'tack|e from upstate New
York checked in with a size 17'/2 football cleat!

Pill News Staff Writer
Three pins and two forfeits in
the last ﬁve matches carried the
Buffalo Bulls to a 32-18 upset over
the Pitt wrestling team Saturday
afternoon.

“It wasn’t an upset,” winning
coach Ed Michael snapped.
“We’ve done well so far this year
(4-1)—-our only loss was to Penn
State, 32-4, and I felt we were the
victims of some home cooking on
the part of the referee. I didn’t
expect us to be blown out in
Pittsburgh. ’ ’

But after victories in the ﬁrst ﬁve
weight classes, the Panthers (2-2)
built an 18-4 lead and had to be
thinking that the ex-Eastern
Wrestling League doormat Bulls
were pushovers. The Buffalo
wrestlers were out of shape and
tired quickly, allowing Pitt to take
command and force the Bulls to stall
for rest time in each individual
match. In the 118-pound bout,
Panther freshman Glenn Maxwell
came from a second-period 4-0
deﬁcit to decision Tom J acoutot.

10-6. Jose Martinez battled
Buffalo’s Mike Jacoutot to a 7-7 tie
in the 126-pound match, Rande
Stottlemyer trounced Ed Tyrrell
11-1 at 134, Mike Bond wallopped
helpless Dave Tundo 14-2 at 142,
and Ed Bredniak overcame Tom
Eagan 12-4 at 150 for the apparent
Pitt rout.

Then the roof fell in. Panther
158-pounder Tom Jones tore a
muscle in his left shoulder late in
the second period of his match
turning a 3-2 lead and good
performance into a pin by the Bulls’
Curt Anderson at 6:00 to cut Pitt's
lead to 18-8.

“Anderson really sparked us,”
Michaels said. “He got us going.”

Inspired, Buffalo’s Bruce Hadsell
ruined Don Ardnt’s season debut,
pinning the 167-pound Panther
wrestler with only 49 seconds left in
the contest.

Pitt's Joe Zombeck followed. by
defaulting his 177-pound battle to
undefeated Dave Mitchel withonly
1:10 remaining when a torn
cartilage in his right knee acquired
early in the third period became too

severe to ﬁnish the match. Buffalo
gladly took the six points, grabbing
the lead for the ﬁrst time in the
afternoon, 20-18.

Jeff Wheeler clinched a Bull win
by pinning overmatched George
O’Kom at 3:36 in the 190-pound
match. Facing an insurmountable
26-18 deficit with only the
heavyweight bout remaining, Pitt
head coach Dave Adams decided
not to let Mark Stepanovich, out the
beginning of the season with
shoulder separation, compete.

“The doctors didn’t want Step-
anovich to wrestle unless he had
to, ’ ’ Adams explained. ‘ ‘They were
afraid he’d re-injure himself.- _And
since we were too far behind, I

decided to forfeit. That match
didn’t matter—the guys we were
counting on let us down. We just
fell apart.

don’t know what—that caused us to

Mistakes caused injuries to Jones
and Zombeck. Both wre hurt when

more points up to his lead. But
despite the fatalities (Jones is
questionable for next weekend’s
quadrangular meet at Temple;
Zombeck can perform if needed, but
will require surgery after the
season’s over), Adams believed his
team was better prepared physic-
ally.

“I think we were in much better
condition,” he said. “Even though
Jim Gordon (starting 167-pounder)
had the ﬂu and couldn’t start and
Bill Bailey (starting 190-pounder)
hurt his knee in the Wilkes
Tournament over the holiday and
couldn't perform, I felt our other
guys could do well. We knew that
Buffalo’s heavier weights were
good, but we felt that we could
compete with them.”

The injuries caused much shuf-
ﬂing in the Pitt lineup, forcing
Zombeck and O’Kom to wrestle at
heavier weights than they are
accustomed.

“Pitt has a lot of injuries,”
Michaels agreed. “They have
outstanding team potential—Stott-

lemyer, Bailey, Stepanovich,
O’Kom. If and when they get all
their kids in the lineup, they’ll have
a great club.”

But for the moment, the Panthers
must settle for upsets like last
Saturday’s.

MAT NOTES: Pitt’s record fell to
2-2, including a 22-13 victory over
Lycoming and a 30-11 loss to
15th-ranked Eastern Wrestling
League rival Bloomsburg in late
December...the Panthers’ league
record dropped to 0-2; Buffalo
raised its total to 1-1...the loss
overshadowed outstanding perfor-
mances by freshmen Maxwell and
Bond, both of whom looked strong
in their respective 10-6 and 14-2
conquests over Buffalo wrestlers...

Martinez, despite having to ﬁght for
a 7-7 tie in the 126-pound match,
was cited by Adams for an
outstanding peformance. “He
always gives 110 percent,” Adams
said. “He’s coming so close to
winning regularly, but a few
mistakes hurt him.”

Jackie Sherrill Finally Has His Day in the Sun

JACKSONVILLE, Fla.-——lt was Jackie Sherrill’s
finest hour. After his Pitt football team soundly
defeated Clemson, 34-3, in what was billed as the
closest of all post-season matchups, he stood before
reporters in acramped Gator Bowl locker room and
reflected on a’very productive season.

“l’m a very fortunate young man,” Sherrill said,
as the victory dousing dripped from his head. ‘‘I was
fortunate enough to have a coaching staff with great
dedication, as well as a group of dedicated seniors
who did a lot to build this team. There is no way we
could have won this year without our seniors.”

As he called in his assistant coaches to share the
glory, Sherrill hit on a keynote.

“Clemson is a real fine football team, who was
overwhelmed by a bunch of determined Pitt
players,” he said. “Our players wanted to go ’out
winners, and to quell the talk they hadn’t beaten a
real fine team all year.”

Sherrill beamed as he issued this statement for the
benefit of his critics, who, even though Pitt ended up
only 12 points short of an undefeated season and a
second straight national championship, accused the
Panthers of not being able to defeat a top-caliber
team.

“With all the adversity and pressure we’ve been
through,” Sherrill said, “this was a must game for
me, the players and ourprogram.”

was asked to do at the start of the season was to
defend the national title, and continue what Johnny

Majors and Tony Dorsett had started. There was
nowhere to go but down, and Sherrilllknew it.

As the Panthers’ hard—luck season progressed,
Sherrill must have wondered secretly how his team
had made it as far as it did. As far into the season as

 

a day before the Gator Bowl, hehad to pinch himself
to make sure it wasn’t just a dream. He told a bowl
luncheon gathering about his pre—season doubts.

“l’ll have to admit that at spring practice, I didn’t
think we had a very good team,” Sherrill said. “l
thought we’d have to struggle.”

Although it was a struggle, Pitt became more
respectable than Sherrill had imagined. Even with
the loss of quarterback Matt Cavanaugh in the
season opener, the Panthers refused to fold. When
the regular season became history, Pitt still found it-
self in the national ranking, with more national at-

, December, and commenced setting straight a football

tention awaiting at the Gator Bowl. In addition,
Sherrill, with an 8-2-1 record, had a chance to
become the winningest first-year coach in the
school’s history by beating Clemson.

Sherrill isn’t the only man to survive the pressures
of a first-year coaching job. Clemson skipper
Charley Pell took over the school’s gridiron fate last

team that had won only five games in its previous two
seasons, making a post-season showing this year a
distant dream.

‘‘I didn’t even think we’d survive the year,” Pell
admitted.

Butt llth—ranked Clemson did survive the season,
and nearly won the Atlantic Coast Conference
championship with an 8-2-1 record. The Tigers’
Cinderella season netted them a Gator Bowl matchtip
with the lOth-ranked Panthers, a game “experts”
analyzed as an evenly matched contest.

Sitting in the background was Jackie Sherrill,
licking his chops at the opportunity of showing a
national television audience Pitt indeed could tally
that elusive victory over a “real fine team.” The op—_
portunity arose, and Sherrill, his coaching staff and-
his players responded. Now, Sherrill’s critics will
have to find another bone to pick.

All this after Sherrill entered the I977 season with
skepticism. lt’.s a cinch he’ll walk into next year’s
training camp with a little more confidence.

Pressure could be an understatement. All Sherrill
