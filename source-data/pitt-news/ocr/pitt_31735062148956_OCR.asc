Chancellor States
No Tuition Raise
For Spring, Fall

According to Dr. Edward H.
Litchﬁeld, chancellor of the Uni-
versity, there will deﬁnitely not be
a tuition increase next year.

In answer to numerous stu-
dent and faculty generated ru-
mors that tuition would be rais-
ed in the spring or fall semes-
ters. the PITT NEWS question-

ed Dr. Charles Peake, assistant
chancellor of student aﬁairs.

Dr. Peake said that there is no
truth to the rumor and quoted the
deﬁnite statement of Chancellor
Litchﬁeld.

The statement positively rules
out any increase for the next two
semesters at least.

Sigma Tau, Psi Chapter, nation-
al engineering honorary. an-
nounced a pledge smoker to be
held Wednesday evening in the
French Room of the Student Un-
ion.

The list of pledges includes 27
men from Electrical Engineering,
19 from Mechanical, twelve from
Metallurgical, nine from Chemical,
seven from Industrial and five
from Civil Engineering.

The initiation banquet will be
held early in Dec. following a pe-
riodof pledging.

""~** Owill be presented in a sequence of

three parts, depicting the different
types of music Foster wrote.

Larry Heller, Col. ’58, and
member of the Pitt Players, will
narrate the program and Frederic
W. Lotz, University organist, will
accompany the Choir.

Songs of Plantation

The first part of the program
will be composed of the planta-

slave’s attachment to “massa” and
his yearning for home.

“My Old Kentucky Home.”
“Massa’s in De Cold, Cold
Ground,” “Old Black Joe.” and
“Old Folks At Home” will be
the selections showing the qual-

music history and literature de-
partment, will sing “Come Where
My Love Lies Dreaming,“ “Gentle

These songs are to portray the
deﬁnite sentimental quality which
was peculiar to the parlor music
of the latter half of the 19th cen-
tury.

The program will conclude
with the livelier. minstrel type
melodies, which are among the
most familiar of Foster's com-
positions.

“Oh Susanna.” “Ring De Ban-

becn chosen to represent the
light"-hearted quality of the

“Music from the Minstrels," which
makes up the third part of the
program.

Flu shots will be given to
full-time graduate and under-
graduate students starting to-
morrow.

The announcement c a m e

after a Thursday afternoon

meeting held in the office of Dr,

‘Better Late Than Never‘

Thus the old adage, “better late
than never,” may apply to the
administration of the flu vaccine
at Pitt. Estimates of the number
of students and University per-
sonnel who have been stricken by
the flu bug so far. have reached
2,000.

According to Dr. Gregg, over
2,000 c. c. of the vaccine have
arrived this week and an equal
amount is expected in succes-
sive weeks. Up to this week, the
amount of available vaccine was
small.

F a c u l t y an d administrative
members and vital personnel,
such as elevator operators and.
members of athletic teams, have

' already been given the opoprtu-

nity to take the flu shots. Stu-
dents and personnel in the medic-
al schools have also received the
shots.

Ten wooden signs whic have
caused much adverse opinion from
the student body and certain stu-
dent organizations have finally
been removed.

These signs, the ones that said
“Let’s Keep Our Campus Clean,”
met with student disapproval
from the time they were put up

Their removal from the low-
er campus took less than a half-
hour with the aid of the build-
ing and groundsmen's pick and
shovel.

One of the ten signs came down

Fisher. This was the work of un-
identiﬁed persons.

The original 24 signs still re-
main in the vicinity of Pitt
Stadium and the upper campus.

After these ﬁrst 24 were made,
an additional order for 30 more
signs were given. Ten of these
were for the lower campus.

The Building and Grounds
Department recently received a
new order for still more signs,
but they now have been told to
stop production on these.

The ten torn down signs will be
stored and according to Charles
Ray of the Department, “They
will probably be burned in time.”

President Tells Council-

AboutGeneralDifficulty

At a recent luncheon meeting of Men’s Council, Presi-
dent Larry Fiedler, Bus. Ad. ’58, addressed the group about
the responsibility and future proposals of Council.

Fiedler stated that at present Council may be regarded
as “a worthwhile organization performing needed functions
but accomplishing the minimum goals.”

This difficulty stems from “a .

general unawareness of the
membership and the student
body’s apathy towards Council.
A seat in Men’s Council is not
an honor unless made through
good deeds; it is a job, and if
done right, a big one,” Fiedler
said.

To correct Council’s shortcom-
ings Fiedler suggested several
projects such as preparing a
brochure expalining government
which would be made available
to all students.

This brochure would familiar-
ize students with the scope and
responsibilities of each organiza-
tion. '

In addition, enlargement of

committee program, participa-
tion of all male students in
Council’s projects. and reor-

ganization of committees were
also proposed.

In conclusion Fiedler noted,
“The incentive must come from
Council members themselves, for
this is not a difficult or expansive
program but a basic essential.”

Because mginemiag is a profession at GM‘

Q

i   -we offer you a ca;recr- not a iob

NE REASON engineering standards at
0 General Motors are so high is that GM
recognizes engineering as a profession. And
the men who engineer the many different
products made by General Motors are
respected for the profession they practice.

That is why, when you are invited to join
General Motors as an engineer, you don’t
simply take a job—you start a career.

It is a career that is rewarding both profes-
sionally and ﬁnancially-—starting on your first
day of association with General Motors at any
one of its 35 divisions and 126 plants in 70
cities and 19 states.

During your early days at GM, for example,
you work with a senior engineer who guides
your career along professional lines.

You are also actively encouraged to pursue
your education towards an advanced degree.
For we at General Motors recognize that, in
doing so, you will become more valuable to
us and the engineering profession.

You are given the opportunity to obtain pro-
fessional recognition through participation
in engineering society forums, presentation
of technical papers, winning of patents and
other recognition of your accomplishments.

And you are also encouraged to take an active V

role in your community’s aﬁairs-—because a
truly professional man is a good citizen as
well as a good engineer.

All this is for a reason-—and a good one.

Many of the men who will ﬁll the key posi-
tions at GM in the future are the young engi-
neers joining GM today. This is not theory,
it is fact. For 14 of our 33 Vice-Presidents are
engineers, 23 of our 42 Division General Man-
agers are engineers, too.’ 7

Today we are looking for young engineers-
such as you-who I may ﬁll these positions
tomorrow. The rewards-—both professional
and ﬁnancial—-are substantial. If you feel you
have the ability, write us. It could Be the most
important letter of your life.

June graduates!

Never Better late 3

It is a rare situation these days when a program for
student health at this University is not carried out in an
efﬁcient and immediate manner.

Last year the Polio vaccinations -were distributed at
Pitt in record time and amazing proportions. The threat
of Polio was not even pressing toward epidemic status. In
fact, there was clearly a period of several months aftertthe
inoculations were administered before the ﬁrst “seasonal”
case of Polio was reported in this county. i

This ‘year a much—needed supplement to the free County
Tuberculosis X—ray program was included in the plans for
the Health program. i ‘

But several hundred students in the University and as
many faculty and administrative personnel can attest to the

admittedly rare but nevertheless unfortunate bogdown of “

the Inﬂuenza Vaccine program,

In at least two other neighboring schools vaccine had
been administered to the student body a full two weeks
before the program was even announced at Pitt. At Ohio
University and West Virginia, several hundred students re-
ceived the shotsin the face of what was called “serious but
not epidemic numbers” of infections. A -

' For the record, There were not as many proven inﬂu-
enza infections at these schools as there were reported in
the last few weeks at Pitt. ‘

The establishment of priorities for distribution of the
limited vaccine supply varied greatly across the country.
At Ohio and West Virginia students were inoculated before
anyone else in the school. Here at Pitt top priority was
given to food handlers and other technical personnel,

But the fact that emerges from all the problems con-
nected with the program is that it is late in coming, per-
haps too late. Not too late to save those of the University
family who have not been stricken with the illness, but

' possibly too late to ﬁnd any cooperation from Pitt people.

The attitude now seems to be that if the disease hasn’t
struck there’s a good chance that it won’t and if it does it
may be better to have the infection and secure a better im-
munity than can be provided by the vaccine-

In this respect the program may be too late. And a
health program is never better if it’s late.

Peake Announces . . .

iNo Tuition Increase

' By Gordon Clowney

The inevitable rumor concerning a proposed in-
crease in tuition for next February or next Sep-
tember has reared its ugly head already in some
quarters. 

However, fortunately for the peace of mind of
the student body, this nasty rumor has been
squelched in a statement issued by Dr. Peake, and

.. authorized by Dr. Litehﬁeld, to

the effect that there deﬁnitely
would be no increase, either this
February or next September. i

This positive statement, au-
thorized by the Chancellor him-
self, should nip in the bud the
guessing and speculating as to
how much tuition would be
raised.

Although‘ still in its embry-
onic stage, this year’s rumor
concerning increased tuition costs
would most surely have reached the advanced
stage, as did last year’s rumor, with almost every-
one connected with the school telling their friends,
in confidence of course, just how much University
ofﬁcialshad decided to raise the costs of t.his...yea1"s
schooling. '

Nobody's Certain ,

Naturally no students really knew until it was
oﬂicially announced this summer just how much
the “bite” would be. Most members of the fac-
ulty and administration could make a fairly ac-
curate guess, but even they could not be certain.

The delay in making the oﬂicial announcement
this summer was caused by the fact that the Uni-
versity did not know for a long while how much
of a state appropriation it would recive to help de-
fray expenses. A

Since ﬁnancial affairs now appear to be on a
sound footing, the announcement was made early
in the year and thus will allow students to plan

with the $23 per credit ﬁgure in mind, instead of
being left up in the air and wondering whether or
not they would be asked to put more on the line
at registration this Spring or next F311.

However, for those of you who are freshmen
and sophomores, this 103’ C0u1d be 8110” “Ved-
Since Dr. Litchfield came to Pitt he has been on
record as saying that he will, in the next decade,
endeavor to bring "Pitt on a par with the foremost
schools in the country.

He has used the Ivy League schools as an ex-
ample. The Chancellor, in attempting to bring Pitt
into the same class academically as Harvard,
Princeton, Yale, Penn, Cornell, and others, is also,
of necessity, going to bring the University on a

par with these schools as regards the tuition pay; 

ments required of students.

Harvard $1000

At present, Harvard's annual tuition is $1000 ff
Ivy 4

a year, fairly representative of the other
League schools. As if this ﬁgure isn’t high enough,
McGeorge Bundy, dean of arts an sciences at
Harvard announced while in town recently on a ..

‘fund-raising tour that this $1000 covers only about

half of the instruction cost.
Dean Bundy also told of plans to increase stu-

. dent tuition even higher in an effort to obtain more

of the educational costs from the student.

It will only be a matter of time until this be-
comes a reality and other top schools follow it.
So, while Pitt is increasing tuition, hoping some
day in the not too distant future to approach that
now charged by the top schools in the country,
these schools too are steadily moving upward, and
keeping a wide gap between themselves and such
schools as Pitt who are trying to catch np to them?

While present undergraduates are safe for an-
other’ year, the inevitable will eventually come,
and if present plans of the administration remain
unchanged, Pitt students of the future can look for
a steady rise in the cost of receiving an education
at Skyscraper U.

Rally 'Round The Flag, Boys

Fiizhugh Schenley

The cover on Max Shulman’s
new book, “Rally Round The
Flag, Boys,” describes the pub-
lication as “a wonderfully funny
novel about love and missiles."
And, indeed, it is both. As you
might expect from Shulman, the
book is packed with ‘humor —

all kinds of humor, from his
usual loud laughs and subtle wit
to a delightful observance of

human characteristics.

Shulman touches on a multi-
tude of situations’ to create his
story. There’s the community -
Putnam’s Landing in Connecti-
cut -—— that is plagued by the
problems of social classes, garb-

_-age disposal, and juvenile delin-'0

quents.

There is the tender love story
of Guido di Maggie and Maggie
Larkin, and there is also the
tender story of Harry and Grace
Bannerman’s rocky marriage.
Mixed in with these sub-plots
are a take—of’f on television and

big business men and an an-
nouncement by the United
States Army that they are build-
ing a Nike guided missile base
in the quiet, ‘residential com-
munity of Putnam’s Landing.

The book, however, is not
merely a group of unrelated sit-
uations and bits of humor
thrown together. There is a de-
ﬁnite plot and a main character
whose name is Guido di Maggie.
The following paragraph from
the book is a brief description of
Guido just after he enters col-
lege.

“His respectable B-minus av-
erage stuck with him. He learn-
ed a smattering of literature, a
smidgen of language, a dash of
history. And, while trailing his
ﬁngers in the main currents of
American thought, he also pick-
ed up some necessary graces. He
joined a fraternity; he got a
jacket with two vents in the
back; he took up the bongos; he
bought a half interest in a
Chrysler Airflow. And, of course,

he played baseball. When Coach
saw the name di Maggie on the
enrollment list, he came pound-
ing on Guido’s door, and Guido,
who wanted to play baseball
like he wanted a third nostril,
was as always obliging.” I

The novel centers mainly
around Guido’s desire to remain
stationed on Long Island. He
goes to great lengths to fulfill
this desire and in doing so
brings into the story a great
number of other people and
their problems.

As already mentioned, despite
these numerous sub-plots and
characters, the reader is pleas-
antly surprised to ﬁnd -himself
leading into a solid story. A story
with which Shulman not only
entertains but teaches. His sharp
outlook on American domestic
and social situations is often-
times more fact than fun.

my mail of late has been flooded with queries from young
inmates of women's colleges wishing to know how one
conducts one's self when one has invited a young gentle-
man for a weekend. This morning, for exmnplc, there
were more than 30,000 letters, each containing a lock of
hair. I gave the hair to a bomb.~'ight maker and the
lanolin to a dry sheep of my acq11aintan(+e, and I turned
instantly to the question: How should a young lady de-
port herself when she has asked a young gentleman to be
her guest at a party weekend?

Well, my dear girls, the first thing to remember is that
your young gentleman is far from home and frightened.

lcgiate competition will begin as
soon as a team can be selected.

Over 100 colleges and universi-
ties in the U.S. sponsor bridge
teams. Last year over 2000 stu-
dents matched wits in the 1957
National Intercollegiate Bridge
Tournament Championship. Cor-
nell University and Oberlin Col-

bridge club, Pitt will soon chal-
lenge the ﬁeld.

on Friday, Nov. 8, at 8 p.m., in
the Social Room of Stephen Foster
Memorial.

The theme of the program will
be: “A Lovelier You.” Mrs. Wil-
liamson will be on hand to answer
any questions directed at her. She
will also discuss hats and hair
styling.

Theaffair is being handled by
Mrs. Agnes Schmitzer and Miss
Virginia ~Bartas.

Put him at his case. You might, for instance, surprise him
by having his mother sitting in a rocker on the station
platform when he gets oft the train.

Next, what kind of Corsage should you send your
young gentleman? Well, my beloved maidens, orchids are

always acceptable.

If you find, my esteemed ﬁllies, that your local florist
has run out of stock, do not bc,clis1nayed. Make a corsage
out of paper. But pick good, stitl’, durable paper—twenty

dollar bills, for example.

I am in mind of a party weekend some years ago at Miss
Pomfri tt’ s Seminary for (ienteel Chicks in West Linotype,
Ohio. Seratina Sigaloos, a sophomore at this institution,
majoring in napkin folding, sent an invitation to a young
man named Falliir Valve, a junior at the Joyce Kilmer
School of l*‘o1'estry, majoring in sap and boles.

Anyhow, Scraﬁna sent an invit1at.ion to Fafnir, and
he came, and she showered him. with kindness and culif
links, and then he went away, and Seraﬁna sat. anxiously
by the mailbox, wondering whether she would ever hear
from him again. Sure enough, two weeks later she got
a letter: “Dear Seratina, (‘an you let me have fifty bucks?
Yours, l“afnir.”

Whimpering with ecstacy, she ran to the bank and
withdrew the money and mailed it to him. From then on,
she got the same request every week, and as a result, she
became very well acquainted with Ralph T. lnvolute,
teller of the West Linotype Bank and Trust Co., and their
friendship ripened into love, and today they are happily
married and live in Stamen, Oregon, where Ralph is in
the extruded molasses game and Seraﬁna is a hydrant.

‘Country Cousins’

ED KOLTI SKA

Sports Editor

At the Varsity Lettermen’s Club annual dinner last Fri-
day evening at the Webster Hall Hotel, Lewis P. Andreas,

‘Athletic Director of Syracuse,

and Coach Ben Schwartzwal-

der of the Orangemen lauded the ﬁne job being done by Cap-

tain Torn Hamilton and John Michelosen of the Panthers. In
.fact, both men went so far to say that they felt like “country
cousins” to the Panthers.

Out of twelve games,_the Blfie and Gold have won eight and lost
two while tieing two. This was probably the\reason for the feelings
expressed by the Syracuse Athletic Staff. Later on in the evening,

‘Captain Hamilton thanked the gentlemen from New York and went

ahead to announce that Michelosen’s contract would be renewed for

another three years. V

This statement was expected,’ but was still received with mixed

feelings. Some were for it and o

thers against it, but before the

evening was over, Coach Michelosen was given 1009 percent support
by all the Lettermen present. They felt a better selection could not

have been made.

The next day though, the Orangemen showed that they were

through being “country cousins” but still wanted to help celebrate the

good news along with the Panthers, and did so by outscoring the
Locals 24-21. The fans got a chance to see a wide open ball game for
the ﬁrsttime. There was a lot of passing, good running and blocking,

and of course scoring.

For a week before the Syracuse game, all interested fans and
sports writers had a feeling that this game would be an easy one for

the Jungle Cats. All-American Jim

Brown was gone and that meant

the team was gone too. For the past two years the whole offense was
centered around Brown, and once he was stopped, Syracuse was also
stopped. This was true the last two years. The Panthers stopped
Brown and won the game on both occasions.
This year Syracuse was heavily under-rated. Without Brown,
Coach Schwartzwalder diversiﬁed his offense. He increased his num-

ber of passing plays and improved

his running plays; something he

didn’t have tb do before because he had Brown. When a coach has
something going good he usually sticks with it. When Brown left,
the Orangemen took to passing with highly improved Chuck Zim-

merman handling the chores.

" In the running department, Tom Stephens, Ed Cofﬁn and second

stringer Gerhard Schwedes showed

fine form ‘as they picked up 151

yards out of the 169 yards total. Zimmerman passed for 127 yards

on nine completions out of ﬁfteen

attempts.

As for the Panthers, the biggest problem they have now is injur-

ies.

Chuck Brueckman and Ed Michaels were the most serious.

Brueckman will be out for four weeks with a right shoulder separa-
tion while Michaels’ rib injuries are being x-rayed. Dick Haley, John

Guzik, and Joe Scisly were all h

If these injuries do not heal fully by next Saturday, then the

hole. Although the Mountaineers

To be able to get back on the winning track again, the Panthers
will have to stop worrying about their last three losses and start think-

ing fresh about a team that will

—tain the desire and ﬁght to win, then perhaps the West Virginia tilt

may set the Jungle Cats straight again.

Frosh Gridders
Meet Kent State

Travel West;

In Final Game

By LARRY HAGGERTY I

The vastly improved Panther freshmen will conclude
their season on Thursday when they journey to Akron, Ohio,
to play the Kent State Frosh. The game will be played under
the lights, but the kickoff time is still undecided.

The Blueand Gold, who haven’t had a winning season
since 1953, made Kent State their only victim last year with

a 27-12 triumph at the Stadium.,¢
All indications seem to point to
another Panther victory this cam-
paign.

“The physical condition of the
squad usually deteiuhines the out-
come of their games,” stated as-
sistant coach Bob Pollock. Pol-

Women’s Sports
Expansion Sought

By New IM Board ,

In order to promote and expand
the women’s sports program at
the University, the Intramurals
Board was formed‘ on Oct. 14,
1957.

The Board, part of the Physical
Education Department, is compos-
ed of representatives of all of the
women’s organizations, dormitor-
ies, nurses residence and women’s
sports groups at Pitt.

The purpose of the Board is

in their second year. As Coach
Bemis puts it, “These men are
just ﬁnding themselves and with
this year’s experience under their
belt they will develop into good
players next year.”

This year’s team is no exception
as all Bemis teams have had many
players with no prior soccer ex-
perience. Don Clark, All—District
Goalieywas on the first team that
played soccer for the Skyscraper
U. In 1954. He had no experience
other than the will to learn soccer
and want to win. That ﬁrst squad
had an eight won and one lost
record.

The next year Clark was in-
strumental in bringing out a
friend, Paul Griffith. Griffith
had no experience in high
school, but he became one of
the best players ever to wear
the Blue and Gold.

He turned out ‘to be an All-

Jungle Cats

By DAVID BREAKSTONE
An aroused and rebounding Syracuse eleven out-fought

and out—maneuvered the faltering Panthers, on Saturday, to“

emerge with a 24-21 upset win. The New York gridders,

spearheaded by Quarterback
back Tom Stephens, scored in

Chuck Zimmerman and Half-
every quarter to chill the Oak-

landers and put a dismal damper on the Homecoming crowd

of 35.430 fans.

The sporadically exciting con-
test, marked by flashes of offen-
sive brilliance and defensive lax-
ness, was decided by a ﬁeld goal
with 2 minutes and 39 seconds
left to be played. Al Gerlick, a
sophomore tackle, booted the ﬁrst
Orange ﬁelder in nine years to
hand the Jungle Cats their third
straight loss.

The defeat, which puts the sea-
son standard at three wins and a
quartet of frustrations, was a
particularly damaging one to local
aspirations for a successful ﬁnish.
Co-captain and Center_ Charley
Brueckman was injured in the
ﬁfth play of the fray. A right
shoulder separation was the diag-
nosis and this may shelve the
sturdy middle man 'for
weeks.

Fumbles Hurt Panthers

Additionally, Guard Ed Mich-
aels was belted down at the
minute mark of the third quarter
and suﬁered undertermined rib
injuries. Halfback Scisly left the
game three times with leg bruises
and wil have his right knees X-
rayecl. today. The Syracuse ath-
letes were undoubtedly hitting
harder than at any other time this
year. p

Fumbles againplayed an im-
portant part in the scoring and
in the Panther defeat. A Bob
Stark bobble in the second per-
iod started the Orange drive
or their second touchdown. A
bad pass from center on fourth
down early in the third stanza
went over Ivan Toncic’s head
and gave the visitors the ball on
the Blue and Gold 29 yard line.
They scored 8 plays later.

The see—saw encounter got
started beneath lead-colored skies
and in_ the wake of a litter of
tissue paper from the Homecom-
ing floats. The players from the

On “Huddle” Show

Th e Panther-Syracuse contest
will be shown on the regular
weekly night “Pitt Huddle” Series
that takes place tomorrow eve-
ning at 8 p.m.

Featured on Dr. H. C. Carlson’s
45 minute spectacular will be the
complete film of last Saturday's
game with Syracuse.

The film account of the game

Southerland. Southerland, who
originally started the series with
Dr. Carlson, was out of town for
a period of time and Ed Koltiska,
sports editor of the Pitt News
ﬁlled in for him. Now Souther-
land is back at the mike again.

This week Carlson hopes to
have Edgar O. Barrett, Athletic
Publicity Director of West Vir-
ginia, as his special guest. A
coach and two players will again
be on hand to help diagram the
touchdown plays for the viewers.

lschool on Lake Onondaga got the
initial advantage when a punt by
Panther Fred Riddle slipped off
his foot and rolled out of bounds
on the locals’ 47 yard line.
Haley Scores

Syracuse started to roll from
there, with only two minutes gone
in the game, and in seven plays
were at the Panthers’ 16 yard line.
Highlighting this surge was a 25
yard screen pass from Zimmer-
man to Stephens. A sharp tackle
by Skyscrapermen Michaels and
Toncic stopped the Orange at the
15 yard stripe.

It then took the locals only
three plays to chalk up their
ﬁrst score. Stark banged out
six yards and Scisly shook free
for 15 more. At his own 36
yard line, Halfback Dick Haley
took a handoff from quarter-
back Bill Kaliden, swept around
right end, shook off two tack-
lers, and whizzed all the way
for the touchdown. Toncic con-
verted to give the Panthers a
7-0 lead.

The opposition stormed back
after taking the kick-off and
marched 62 yards in 12 plays to
tie the issue at 7-7. Stephens
scored. Zimmerman accounted for
40 yards via passes. ‘

Gerlick Converts

The Panthers retaliated im-
mediately by having Toncic throw
a 65 yard pass to End Dick Scher-
er for a touchdown, on the sixth
ensuing play from scrimmage.
Toncic converted again to put -the
mark at 14-7.

Syracuse scored early in the
second quarter following that
ﬁrst Panther fumble. They
pocketed the six pointer after
seven plays, starting at the
local 33 yard line. Stephens
scored again for the Orange
and Gerlick converted.

The third period began with the
scoreboard showing 14-14. Syra-
cuse took a 21-14 lead after the

bad pass from center snafued
the reeling Panthers. Zimmerman
took the ball over himself and
Gerlick tallied the bonus point.

The locals counted what was
to be their ﬁnal touchdown with

four .minutes gone in the last
quarter. In Seven plays the
Panthers ambled 64 yards and

scored with Kaliden steping 12
yards on a brilliant execution of
the keeper. Fred Riddle provided
the big yardage in the drive with
a 34 yard' jaunt through tackle.
Toncis converted.
