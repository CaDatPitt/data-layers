SGB president protem resigns title, remains on board

By Teresa Candori
News Editor

Student Government Board
member George Kontos last night
resigned as president protem of

the SGB, but will remain on the,

board and continue his duties as
a member.

SGB president Phil Moyer read ,

Kontos’ letter of resignation at last
night's meeting of the board.
Kontos, who was absent from the
meeting, offered‘ no official rea-
son for his resignation in the let-

ter, and said simply that he
intends to maintain his_position
as aboard member.

Kontos could not be reached
for comment but, in an interview
following the meeting, .Moyer
said Kontos resigned for personal
reasons.

”The reasons are basically be-
tween George and myself,” Moy-
er said. ”We both felt that it
would be wisest for him to step
out of the position.”

ber Fiora Boehm to succeed Kon-

BAS election dispute
results in confusion

By. Kathy Stahl

News Editor

Efforts to rectify the dispute
over the recent Black Action So-
ciety elections are being ham-
pered by a lack of agreement
among the members of the com-

mittee.

As of Wednesday afternoon,
the BAS planned to announce

I'm sure all the can-
didates want ... things
to be as they should be.

— Vaughn Clagette

that re-elections of officers would
be held this ‘Saturday, but late
yesterday afternoon Mickey
Washington, secretary of the
BAS, cancelled an advertisment
in The Pitt News on the re-
election. ' '
According to Washington,

’ members of the Elections Com-

.mittee were in -a meeting and
were still debating the validity of
the re-election.

”The ad wasn't really a misun-
derstanding,” said Tricina Cash,
‘Elections Committee chairperson,
”but I can't really say anything
until we have an official state-
ment, which probably won’t be
until Monday.” A

According to Cash, a commit-
tee met yesterday afternoon to
discuss the procedures of the
election which took place on
March 9. Cash would not speci-
fy whether the meeting involved
the Steering Committe or the
Elections Committee. The meet-
ing carried on longer, than the
committee anticipated; therefore,
"we still haven't gone through all
the procedures,” said Cash.

The misunderstanding over the
first BAS election centers on the
authenticity of 147 votes. Stu-
dents were allowed to vote if they
presented a BAS membership
card, or ifthey had an initialized
signature‘ of any member of the
Elections Committee.

signatures from members on the
Elections Committee were not
sufficient to count as credible

votes. Because of this, 147 votes-

were discounted.

The results of.the election
were:
Simms defeated Vaughn Clagette
by‘20 votes, 101-81. Deputy
Chairperson; Melanie Berg

defeated Lynette Wellington by -

25 votes, 103-78. »
The outcome of the election

was contested by Clagette and

Wellington. Clagette took a for-

mal complaint over the decision '

to Vice President of'Student Af-
fairs Conney Kimbo. "| contest-
ed several things about the
election procedures,” said
Clagette. One concern was the
destruction of the 147 votes after
the election. Clagette said that he
could not comment on his other
complaints at this time.‘

Kimbo was unavailable for
comment but Assistant Vice
President for Student Affairs Den-
nis Donham said, '’I think it's

. good that they're meeting, and
I'm confident that they'll be able

to resolve this misunderstanding
with their. own proceedings.”

With regard to the outcome of
the committee's decision on
whether or not to hold another
election, Clagette said, ''I hope
that this can all get cleared up. I
hate trying to second guess some-
one. People in general seem to al-
ways go the opposite way that
you think. Hopefully they made
a decision." .

Please see BAS, page 6

It was _.
decided after the election that the

Chairperson; Monique .

tos as president protem. Boehm
was approved unanimously by
the board members present.

Moyer emphasized that Kontos
had not been derelict in his duty
as president protem. Under the
SGB’s constitution, the president
protem must represent the presi-
dent
president.

"He did not neglect his duties
as they are outlined in the con-
stitution,” Moyer said, and sug-
gested that the resignation was

in the absence of the

VOLUME EIGHTY-ONE, ISSUE SEVENTY-THREE

the culmi_nat_i9n of a term-long
"undercurrent.”

Kontos’ resignation coincided
with the culmination of another
SGB controversy involving the al-
locations appeal of the Pan-
Hellenic Council.

The board voted last night to
reconsider three items in the Pan-

Hel Council's budget request-

which the board rejected in Pan-

He|’s original appeals hearing.
The SGB reversed its original

decision to deny PanHel funding

for professionally printed rush .
posters ($385.00), copies of a" -’ 
PanHel newslettef l§S64_.72) and
rush invitations ($173.00). ‘
According to Chairperson Ka-~

ren Bohichick, the1Al|ocations»
Committee recommended the
denial of the funds based ‘on
across-the-board budget cuts for
all organizations; the board re-
jected the recommendations in
recognition of special considera-. I
tions for governance organi-
zations.

Florida boy receives second transplant at Children ’s

PITTSBURGH (AP) ~ A 2-year-
old Florida boy whose body re-
jected his first transplanted liver
received a second organ in a

‘ 10-hour operation Thursday.

Kevin Reid of Satellite Beach,
Fla., was in critical condition in
the intensive care unit of Chil-
dren's Hospital of Pittsburgh af-

-ter the surgery, which ended
. Thursday afternoon, said hospital

spokeswoman Lynn McMahon.

The boy, who suffered from
biliary atresia, a blockage of the
liver’s bile ducts, received his first
new liver in an operation Satur-
day. The organ malfunctioned,
however, and a second transplant
was necessary, according to Miss
McMahon.

LONDON — About 1,000
‘people will die of cancer in

About 750 of the deaths will
occur in West-Germany and Ita-

No laughing matter

By Dave Zafris
Contributing Editor

. It seems a difficult assignment:
to write a comedy about the situ-
ation in South Africa.

A comedy.

Racial segregation and the
persecution of millions of people
is not exactly prime material for
a night of fun theater.

But the San Francisco Mime

V ‘Troupe has been performing po-

litically satyrical plays for over 20
years, and they will appear at
Graffiti tonight with The Mozam-
gola Caper, a look at the CIA’s in-
volvement in South Africa.

The play’s author, Joan Hold-
en, has been the troupe’s prin-
cipal playwright since she was
introduced to the group by her

first husband, mimevtrouper Ar— '

thur Holden.
Holden was writing short sto-

. ries about her own experiences at

the time, but the Vietnam War,
civil rights and the women's
movement proved to spawn
more interesting stories than her
own experiences ever could.

. She began to write a series of
overtly political plays .— such as
Dragon Lady's Revenge, which

had strong parallels to the Viet-

nam War, Squash, written about
the Arab,»oil embargo, and False
Promises, the mime troupe’s sa-
tyrical salute to the nation's bi-
centennial.

about South Africa?

”The play’s not directly about
the racial segregation in South
Africa. It's about U.S. involve-
ment in a country very similar to
South Africa,” she said.

Holden shies away from writ-
ing about the atrocities commit-
ed underithe apartheid system of
government. Instead of informing
the public, something she sees as
the job of the mass media, Hold-
en tries to draw the audience into
the story.

In that way, the audience can
actually feel for the characters in-
volved. And if people feel for
characters in a play, Holden said
they actually might try to .do

_ something about the situation.

’’If the people in the audience
can learn something, ifthey can
feel forthe characters in the play-,
then maybe they will feel they
can have an impact —- that they
can change the world,” she said.

’’I think there's a really _strong

feeling in thisfcountry that today's .

problems are too huge for us to
solve.”

The San Francisco Mime
Toupe has the ability to make
even the most devestating issues
humorous. With their zany
characters, overdone acting and
their complete disregard for creat-
ing the illusion of reality, the
troupe has become international-
ly known.

Police protection
should start now

It's springtime.
The warm weather has returned and with it, beach towels,
miniskirts, baby oil and Jams. Unfortunately, something else

" has also returned; the weekend war zone.

Last Saturday, Peter's Pub, an Oakland drinking establishment,
was attacked by a group of bottle-throwing teen-agers. The bar
sustained $70 worth ofdamage to its front windows, but for-
tunately, none of its patrons was seriously injured.

We have all seen this before — only five months ago. This
same area of Oakland, where Forbes and Fifth avenues are
joined by Bouquet Street and Oakland Avenue, was terrorized
by violent teen-age gangs. It seemed anyone wearing a gold
chain was a target. T

If what happened last weekend is any indication, then we
can expect to see the weekend war zone + chapter two --

' tonight and Saturday night. Crossing the intersection where Bou-

quet meets Forbes may be comparable to crossing the Park-

_ V way Eastduring rush hour — dangerous.

The key to eliminating a problem is recognizing it before it
has_a chance to surface. In the fall, the city and the university
waited too long before taking action. Thus, the damage had
already been done before the problem was solved. That must

V _ not happen this time. _ «

The issue at hand is that of student safety. Increased police
patrols eliminated the violence problem in the fall, and students

, got home safe at night. It is time to increase the patrols again.

The reason for increasing the patrols should be to prevent
unprovoked assaults on students of the university. Itshouldnot
be done as a response to increased unprovoked assaults. But
if our public safety directors, William Tucker at Pitt and Glen
Cannon downtown, wait too long, that will be the case.

Act now, gentlemen. '

CONDRON

It only hurts for a lifetime

What is the value of ex-
perience, and what does ex-
perience have to do with suicidal
-tendencies?

Mike Royko, a Chicago—based
syndicated columnist, seems to
think he hasthe answer.

In a column headlined ”Teen
suicide nonsense,” which ap-
peared in the Sunday, March 22,
1987 issue of The Pittsburgh
Press, Royko tells of a phone call
he received recently during
which a young female relayed
that she was contemplating
suicide. '

For some obscure reason, he
downplayed the girl's pain; He
saw her distress as unwarranted,
for she lacked what might be
termed ”life experience.” He

~ would seem to be unaffected by

this girl's actions, perhaps be-
cause she is not a significant per-
son in his life. In the last, and
certainly the most nonsensical
point that he attempted to make,
he defined suicide as ”an act of
vanity, selfishness and weakness
— as well as stupidity.”

What bothers me most is his
application of the "argument

JUDY
HARFORD

from experience” to suicide.
Those who have borne the brunt
of many years in this world often
downplay the emotions, thoughts
and experiences of those of us
who have seen but a few years of
life —— those of us who have not
yet been hardened by the cruelty
of reality that comes only with
age. Absurdity abounds.

Those who use this argument

seem to believe that there is some -

correlation between age and the
amount of pain experienced.
Does this mean that if two peo-
ple, one 20 and the other 50,
both experience the loss of, say,
a brother, then the 50-year-old
would necessarily experience
more pain due simply to her age?
According to Royko’s line of ar-
gument, this would be the case.
But this contradicts another of his
claims — specifically, that pain is
not relative.

That's an interesting idea. Is
pain relative? Relative to ex-

perience, hardly. Then again,
perhaps it is the perception of
pain that is relative to experience.

If this is in fact the case, then
what of our biases toward suicide

among young people? How can.

anyone, no matter how jaded,
how ' embittered, evaluate
‘another’s pain? If a 16-year-old
were desperate enough to even
seriously contemplate suicide,
then obviously she would per-
ceive her situation to be quite
painful — regardless of how trivi-
al it might seem to anyone else.

Unfortunately, this often occurs
— the weather-worn criticize
their youthful counterparts for
supposed naivete. Certainly ex-
perience is valuable in problem-
solving, for it is useful to have a
better understanding of a situa-

tion, due to hindsight. But it is ,_

equally valuable to have a fresh
point of view". Often insight
results from being able to see
new aspects of" a problem — a
capability due to lack of ex-
perience.

Catholic faith. However, since
Copernicanism appeared to con-
tradict certain passages in the Bi-
ble, the Church insisted that it be
taught only as a theory until it
was proven a fact. Galileo
refused.

'86 issue of Scientific American
explains, there is a widespread
myth that the Copernicans Bruno

Ms. Sansig also refers in her
column to ”the Catholic priest in
New York who passed out con-
doms at one of his church serv-
ices.” -The Rev. Carl Thitchener
of Amherst, N.Y., is a Unitarian
minister, not a Catholic priest. It
is worth noting that, according to

that the ”only sane conclusion”

was that the issue was a question »

of raising eight million dollars,

Fundamental foolishness

Hell's a poppin”in fundamen-
tal christiandom. A scandal’s
breaking that sounds like a plot
from a prime-time soap. It has all
the essential ingredients-— sex,
blackmail and a power struggle.

. The key players in this drama

aren't Alexis and Blake Carring-
ton, they aretwo of America's
most powerful TV evangelists,
Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart.

Things are tough all over for
poorjimmy Bakker. Aishort time
ago, his dear wife Tammy tried to
walk out of a plane — while it
was cruising at about 30,000 feet,
that is. The plane landed in Los
Angeles, and Tammy landed in a
drugrehabilitation center. That
was a setback for Bakker’s PTL
(Praise The Lord, cynically called
Pass The Loot by some) organiza-
tion, but since drug rehab is
almost fashionable, the Bakkers
could have ridden through Tam-
my-’s problems with their reputa-
tions intact. After all, she was
only addicted to prescription
drugs, it's not like it was heroin
or anything.

Just when the Reverend Bakker
thought that things couldn't pos-
sibly get any worse, they did.
Jim’s no longer the chairman of_
PTL. He resigned last weekend af-
ter the news broke that he had
been tasting a 21-year-old church
secretary's forbidden fruit, and in

order keep the fair former—maiden _

quiet, Bakker allegedly paid her
$115,000 in- PTL money. Wow.

Jim and Tammy's devoted fol-
lowing donate money to PTL to
help pay for pagan baby conver-
sions and PTL's multi-million dol-
lar christian amusement park
(which really does exist, com-

- plete with waterslides and a wave

pool that doubles as a baptismal
pool on Sundays). I'm sure their
flock was real happy to hear how
some of their money was spent.

Just when we thought things
"couldn't possibly get any worse,
they did. On Tuesday, March 24,
rival Reverend Jimmy Swaggart
admitted that he launched the in-
vestigation of Bakker’s sins of the
flesh (which by the wayare the
deadliest of all the deadly sins).

Both Swaggart and Bakker are
ministers of the 2 million mem-
ber Assemblies of God.

Swaggart had heard rumors
about Bakker’s sexploits and tried
to get the Assembly of God to dis-

tance itself from Bakker and PTL.
Swaggart didn't want the whole
church to be implicated in a scan-
dal, if one should ever break. Of
course, Swaggart wasn't acting in
his own interests. Bakker used to
control a $172 million empire,
and Swaggart would never
”covet his neighbor's goods.”

It was a selfless act. An act’

meant to further the efforts of his
church, right Jimmy? Give me a
break. In his willingness to save

his church from being dragged
through the mud in a possible
scandal, Swaggart pulled down
his whole profession.

According to Bakker, Swaggart
was involved in a "diabolical
plot" to discredit him and to take
over the 500,000—member PTL.
Swaggart claims he wouldn't
want it in the first place.

"This whole situation is hilari-
ous. Two self-appointed pontiffs
are rolling in the dirt, while
America looks on in amusement.

Jimmy Swaggart is a power-
hungry scandal-monger. Jim Bak-
ker is a lecherous hypocrite. Life
or death pleas for $8 million are
bad enough, but Bakkergate has
dealt what may be a death blow
to the evangelization industry.

Bakker and Swaggart have the

market cornered on finger point— '

ing. Now, their own machine has
backfired,'and they're caught in
the middle of it. These two
should have realized’ that if
you're going to be (nauseatingly)
self-righteous, make sure you've
got nothing to hide. People who
live in glass churches shouldn't
throw stones,’ you know?

Bakker’s people have vowed to
expose a faux pas or two of Swag-
g_art's ' in the coming weeks,
which will be interesting. So by
all means, stay tuned.

Gee,'I can hardly wait for the
book, and this isgoing to make
one peach of a mini-series one of
these days.

Thefinal reign of madness

March is a terrible month. It's
a time for catching up on all of
the work that I've fallen behind
on and now have to do before fi-
nals — two weeks from today.

Yes, finals are just around the
proverbial corner. How can a_ny-
one forget? Iknow that every time
I talk to my parents, the conver-
sation comes around to finals,
grades and expectations.

Expectations? I was out until 4
a.m. last night, and my parents '.
want to know what kind of-ex-
pectations I have? .

Nothing likea little guidance
from home, lguess. Being brand-
ed as the family disgrace looms
as thefavorite heavy threatthis
time of the year. It's not a
pleasant thought, but_think"about
the kind of summer you'll have
if you let your parents down and
then have to move home for
three months or so.

Fine. We might as well talk
about expectations. I expect to
take a few finals and pass my
classes". No, I haven't set any lofty

' goals. I'm not striving for a 4.0’

point, I'm striving for something
much more important — simply
to pass.

What is the big deal about
grades? I don't attach any impor-
tance to grades. You take a test,
you get graded. What if you

know the stuff and draw a blank V

on the day of the exam? It
happens.

Maybe my parents would have
liked me to set higher goals, but
I didn't. They know I didn't. At
least I'm honest.

But .seriously,. aren't. parents

weather during March. When

it do me any good?

BOB GREENE

‘ week before the game in the host city. But just a few hours be-

fore kickoff, I left and came home. I just knew that the game
itself would be an anticlimax.

The U.S. International Challenge Cup croquet match, that
sounds like something worth seeing. The sponsors of the tour-
nament sent me an itinerary. The itinerary is dotted with intrig-
uing references. On Thursday, April 9, for example,.at 7 p.m.,
there is the "Tropical Buffet." On Friday, April 10, at noon, there
is ”Picnic Lunch at the Croquet Club."

Hey, it may not rank up there with Ernie Pyle covering World
War II, but it sounds great. .

As I said, though, we aren't allowed to accept free trips, so
I had to turn the invitation down. In so doing, however, I con-
versed with one Kerry T. Gleason, spokesman for the croquet
tournament, and he filled me in on what would be going on.

"The croquet court is called a greensward,” Gleason said.‘

”There are six wickets on the greensward. There are four play-
ers competing at a time. In backyard croquet, you hit the ball

through nine wickets, then you hit the pole, and you win. In-
_ this tournament, there is much more strategy involved. There

is a time limit, too. I believe it is an hour anda half per match."
Gleason said that there are strict rules governing the colors
of the croquet balls. ”There is a blue ball, a red ball, a black

ball and a yellow ball,” he said. "No variation is allowed.” .
Apparently, this goes for the clothing ofthe_players,,:too._1: .;

"You can, wear anything you want on the croquet court, as
long as it's white," Gleason said. ”Players wear loose-fitting
white slacks, so that they can bend over. They also wear white
sweaters." '

Gleason admitted that the appeal of croquet is not massive; 
”It’s not like football or.basebalI, where people will camp out- ..

side the stadium,” he said. _\ _ .
On the other hand, "Last year 300,000 croquet sets were sold

in the United States," he said. "And more people are joining C _

country clubs that have croquet courts.” -
The reason? ”People are looking for upscale activities," Glea-
son said. "Both yachting and croquet are gaining a growing fol-

lowing. You don't work up a sweat. You can play the game.

while drinking a Perrier and lime."
I asked about the mallets. Did world-class croquet players

. swing them the same way that golfers swing putters?
"There are numerous ways of holding a ma|let," Gleason said. '

"But standing with your legs apart and swinging the ma|let'be-
tween your legs is the favored way.”

The U.S. International Challenge Cup croquet match is not '_

destined to turn into an uncontrollable media event. "We have

invited 45 press people from the United States,” Gleason said.

"We have invited another 27 from Britian. Realistically, we will ._

be happy if we get five reporters from each country."
And how about the general public? Does Gleason expect a
big crowd?

’’It depends on how you define the word ‘big,’ " he said. "I7

think we will have a gallery of 100 people or so.”
Only 100 people? Will they sit in bleachers? - C ,
".No,’’‘he said. "There are no bleachers. The members of the

gallery will stand around the edges of the greensward.’They may I Y" I A

bring folding chairs if they wish.”

There will be no live television coverage of the croquet tour— ~ ' 

_nament. "It would sortof be like live coverage of a chess
match," Gleason said.

Croquet players need not be burly, he said. ”This is one sport’

that can theoretically be played equally well by men, women
and even children," Gleason said. ”The skill level is really quite

high. There are trick shots. You can jump one ball over another, is

for example, to get to the wicket.”
I apologized again for not being able to take him up on the

invitation. I asked him what I — and the approximately .240 C

million other Americans who won't be at the croquet tourna-
ment —— will be missing. _

"You'll be missing the highest quality competition of a think-1 I

ing man's sport,” he said. ”Make that a thinking person's sport.”

Schoolcomes first for Knight's Hoosiers

By Austin Wilson

AP Sports Writer

NEW ORLEANS - French
Quarter bars and persistent
reporters have nothing to do with
Indiana's late arrival for the Final
Four, said Coach Bobby Knight.
It's jus_t that school work comes
first.

Nevada-Las Vegas, Providence
and Syracuse all flew in on Wed-
nesday to begin on-site prepara-

tions for tomorrow's semiﬁnals of
the college basketball champion-
ship tournament. Indiana arrives
today. '

”As long as I've been involved
in coaching, we have never -
regardless of the game, whether
it's a regular season game or a
conference tournament or an
NCAA tournament game, first-
round or championship game —
ever gone to the site of a game
more than one day prior to the

game,” Knight said by telephone
Wednesday.

"That's been our policy for
22-23 years. We'll miss a little
class on Friday. We'll get the
chance to work out on Friday,

and that's the way we've always_

doneit”

UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian,
the only coach who was on hand
for the telephone news confer-
ence, said one of his reasons for
coming in on Wednesday was to

give his players a chance to see
New Orleans.

Tarkanian said he let the play-

ers have fun on Wednesday but
kept them under close surveil-
lance yesterday. Added Tarkani-
an, "However, we won't isolate
them from the press, becausell
think it is very important to give
them the opportunity to talk to

the press and other people. I-

think that's a real learning ex-

Pitt head football coach
Mike Gottfried certainly seems
as if he is trying to prove the
"old axiom that the more things
change, the more they stay the
same. Especially in the case of
Ezekial Galdson. '

Gadson, the 6-1,210 pound
junior from Frogmore, S.C.,
was originally recruited to the
Pitt Panther football team as a
tailback. But, last year in
spring practices, he was
moved to a linebacker posi-
tion. And in the regular sea-
son, (where in '10 games he
made 41 tackles, 23 unassist-
ed) he played that position
very well. I

But now, there is a good
possibility he may be moved
back to the tailback job!

Normally, anyone in the po-
sition Gadson is in would
probably feel the same as a
Mexican jumping bean — first
here, then there, then back to
here again. But Gadson really
doesn't seem bothered by it at
all.

"No, I really don't mind
what the coach is doing at
all,” said Gadson. ''I really feel
that tailback is my natural po-
sition. After all, it is the posi-
tion I was originally recruited
to play for Pitt. '

"I really think if I am able to
play at tailback, I will be more

think I'm good at it. But I've
got to do whatever is best for
the team, and basically I'll play

of it." I

fried does feel Gadson has the
potential to play the position
well and to possibly obtain a
starting spot when the regular
season rolls around.

"It's hard to say right now,
but we're just going to take a
look and see what he has,"
said Gottfried. "That's the best
thing about spring practice —
it gives you a chance to see
your strong points, as well as
your weak points early. From
there, you can cultivate the
strong ones early and keep

_them strong. And Zeke is a

good player"
_ One of the possible reasons
for such a switch ‘could be the

.running back situation, or,

possibly the lack thereof. Both
Craig "|ronhead" Heyward
and Charles Gladman of

and handle them well, but
they need backupsrjust in

point.

At this point, Gadson has to
fill whatever position Gottried
wants. But whatever it is, he is

ready.

congratulations_ to the loyal readers of The Pitt News ‘N,
during the bicentennial year of the University 0 '
Pittsburgh.

For two centuries you have upheld the goals of Hugh
Brackenridge, founder of Pittsburgh Academy and
grandfather of the University of Pittsburgh.’ He left a
legacy of scientific and intellectual accomplishment in
which students, faculty and scientific researchers have
made profound contributions to our Nation. I'm thinking
of accomplishments like the development of the Salk ’
polio vaccine, unlocking the mysteries of Saturn's rings
and establishing an organ transplant center-.-— but also
of the lesser—known achievements by countless thousands
of students, alumni and staff. ’ 

I . §‘*‘“t**Es .

menu a ..,., ‘_‘_‘”,

All of these. contributions have exemplified cultural
awareness, a sense of morality and a sense of purpose
and service to humanity. As you begin your third
century of service, I know the same determination will
prompt you to promote the intellectual and spiritual
ideals of our country.

THE PITT NEWS ALUMNI REUNION, Friday, March 27, 1987

By Marion F. Loresch Olson
Staff Writer, 1933

was a journalism student

and worked on the Pitt

school paper in 1932

and 1933. Back then,

going to school and working at

the school paper was a little
different than it is now.

Along with many menial jobs,

I occasionally had a column in

the paper. It was a chatty shop-

ping column called Patti Pitt

Goes Shopping — or something, V

similiar.

I haunted the dress shops in
downtown Pittsburgh. My strate-
gy was to go through the shop,
spot certain items, write them up
with a big enthusiastic splurge,
then approach the manager.

I would tell her how much it
would cost an inch to print the ar-
ticle, and let her decide how
much to print. She herself would
edit the ad.

I remember, I had the idea for
the column and ranaround in my
flapping galoshes in all the dirty,
slushy snow and sold it inch by
inch. Then I turned up at the
paper's office with the fait accom-
pli and the cash. The big shots on
the paper were really impressed
— with the money, that is. Money
was very hard to come by in

Things did not go over as well
with the more professionally-
oriented people I knew who were
involved in journalism.

Our journalism professor was
a very easy going, laid-back sort.
His name was White, I believe.

I remember him saying if a per-

son's grandmother died sudden-
ly, and that person had‘ to miss
class, but was later seen enjoying
a ball game at Forbes Field — it
was all ‘right with him.

He didn't care how often some-
one’s grandmother died, as long
as the person's work was on his
desk on time and was good.

Well, if it isn't ’Patti Pitt’ from the 19305

of us would ever be offered
$100,000, but all of us would
come up against pressure to color
or drop a story. I have found this
advice to be a good pattern for
life in general. -

One of the requirements of his
course was that we each must get
something published in a ”real”
paper — a tough assignment.
Back in the '30s, I suppose, there
was not a single newsman in
Pittsburgh who had ever taken a
course in journalism. And so the
”real" people on those ”real’f
papers took a very dim view of
anyone trying to learn the busi-
ness by studying it in college. We
were met with attitudes of
amused derision and sometimes
with downright hostility. It was a
hard battle to breach that impreg-
nable wall with our carefully
wrought little pieces.

I enjoyed working with the
people on the paper. Theywere
a little brash, perhaps, but also a
little brighter than most. It has
been gratifying to think back to
those days. It was all great.

By Jack Markowitz
Managing Editor, 1952

he epithet that stung the most was ”the‘silent
generation.” We were the students of the early -

1950s, what came to be called the McCarthy

era. The moral failings of the age weren't drugs,
divorce, abortion ‘or any of those overt things. Our vice
was passive. ”Conformity.” We must have seemed aw-
fully timid troops for the battles against injustice to that
intrepid Harvard professor ("I think it was) who pinned
the reproach of silence on us in a famous magazine ar-
ticle. We were the whipped younger brothers of that
ubiquitous nerd -a|ready.seen to be anesthetizing Ameri-
can business, the ”organization man," the ”man in the
gray flannel suit,” determined to get along by going

' along.

, Our imputed gutlessness troubled me at the time, but
Ihave grown better at recognizing the aroma of socia-
logical baloney. Looking back, I doubt that the millions
of us were any more silent or catchable in a single phrase
than any other generation, including the most admired
of all, the ”lost.” What is more interesting to me today
is why our useful if unheroic purposes — going to class,
taking courses, preparing for jobs in the real world —
why all of this should have seemed censurable to-our

t militant critic, himself sounding the trumpet from a cushy

chair in tenured academic security. Get out there and
protest, boys and girls! Bourgeois society's gotta be rot-
ten a thousand ways, the best writers say so!

Bubbles of youthful activism did in fact rise in me. I
eventually wrote a column declaring that even an out-
an—out Communist ought to be able to teach at Pitt or
at any university. But I'm ahead of my story..First I had
to get on the staff, right?

I entered Pitt in the fall of 1949 and, having suddenly I

"decided to point for a career in journalism, joined the

' student-newspaper right away. It was one of the smar-
?test things I have ever done. When asked today where

I learned my trade, such as I know it, Ilreply, truthfully,

I at The Pitt News. At least 80 percent of it. I mean what

a ”lead” is; who, what, when, where, why; important
"details at the top, less vital going down. The rest is just
experience, elaboration and resistance to’ going into pub-
lic relations. ’

lack Markowitz’ first byline ap_pearéd Ian. 20, 1950.

Journalisticaptitiute lay deep in me, however. Very
-deep. Bill ScrIvo,.the News’ equivalent of a city editor
in my freshman year, confessed later that he was often

‘tempted to urgealternative extracurricular activities upon ‘

me.~For weeks, months, I could not get the hang of cover-
ing, writing or recognizing a news story. I believe com-
bined are called the hat trick. * » ‘
Not that I didn't‘ apply myself. I haunted the News
office, then located _in a ”pub|ications wing” of the
eighth floor of the Cathedral of Learning. I got in the habit
of spending 20, maybe 30 hours a week there; just hang-

ing around does pay off, I've found, if you're not _totally
obnoxious. By January of 1950, I finally got a byline,
my first, and by that spring I was more or less accepted
as part of the paper's future. I learned about layout, writ-
ing and ”counting” headlines from Copy Editor Al-Gioia
and was picked to succeed him the next year.

The greatest thing about training on The Pitt News in
those days was the ”big city” attitude of older staff mem-
bers. Many were World War II veterans finishing their

education on the GI Bill. I've always been grateful that _

I got into Pitt before they got out. Besides Scrivo and
Gioia there was Edward Jensen, plus several of_ the sports-
writers (although they worked for a sports editor who
was younger and not a vet, Myron Cope). Donal ”Doc”
Giffin, a skinny, intense fellow, was the editor, and he
stood very toughly forthe professional approach — that
is, for putting out a newspaper, not just a ”student
newspaper.” Editorializing in news stories was forbid-
den; younger reporters were taught to recognize the taste
and spit it out. Any appeal to school spirit in the rah-rah

"sense was, of course, anathema. To an 18-year-old fu-
. ture newspaperman (who dreamed of someday making

$100 a week at it), it was an honor to be admitted to
the bull sessions of these worthy elders around the copy
desk rim. . ‘

Sports Editor Cope I had known as a boy in the neigh-
borhood and in high school, where he was even then
a superlative writer (and, less well known, a talented
clarinetist). Myron always had a strong interest in pub-
lic issues. It seemed a waste that he should head for a
career reporting call games. He used to say that it was
his hearing problem that pushed him toward sports, be-
cause they were visual; he would not have to listen so
much- But he was always more than a game-watcher.
I've treasured one of the great put-down lines of all time
that Cope captured for The Pitt News. It came from
basketball coach ”Doc” Carlson in the days when
coaches must have had to actually sit on the bench. ‘A

ohn Kennedy, then a United States senator be-

nomination, and Nikita Khrushchev, before he
went from Russian ruler to non—person, came
to Pitt that year, and their visits were certainly the

highlights of my year as editor of The Pitt News. But

_ there was another incident that stands out in my

mind with equal clarity, because it says so much
about an aspect of the university that always
bothered me. .

The incident involved Johnny Michelosen, a nice
guy, but by this time something less than effective as
a football coach. Johnny Majors and Jackie Sherrill
never had it happen to them, but Johnny Michelosen
was hanged in effigy during another disasterous foot-
ball season. No one is hanged in effigy anymore.
But then, colleges don't have panty raids anymore,
do they?

With totally misguided and erroneous thinking,
some members of the football team, as well as some
of their supporters, firmly believed that I was the
guiding hand behind the dastardly act of hanging a
dummy that didn't even resemble the coach from a
tree on campus. ’

I was suspected for two reasons: .

0 The effigy was hanged from a tree outside the
student union, where The Pitt News offices were
located. _ .

0 The Wednesday edition of the paper had a pic-
ture of the hanging, and how else could we have
had a picture of something that happened Tuesday if
we hadn't planned the hanging and executed it.

The location, I suppose, had been selected by the
perpetrators because it was centrally located, a site '
where many students would pass and thus be able
to see the handiwork of whoever did it. The picture
we had in the paper the next day resulted not from
prior knowledge or even warnings but from an alert
staff photographer who saw the dummy hanging
from the tree and took a picture of it. The pho-
tographer then called me at home (my mother woke
me to take the call after I had a typically late night
putting the Wednesday edition together), told me
about the effigy and asked if we could get the pic-
ture in the paper if he took it to the printer's.

That was the first I knew about the incident, but I
sleepily applaudedhis inititive and told him yes,
take the picture to the printer's and substitute it for

Pitt football playersblamed Murray Chass when Coach
Johnny Michelosen was hung in effigy on Oct. 21, 1959

whatever less interesting picture was on whatever
page we decided to place it. ..

I was accused of masterminding the whole inci-
dent because I had shown in some of my columns
over the. years that I was less than fanatical about
the Pitt football team. Pitt, at the time, could not be
compared with the Oklahomas and the Alabamas of
then or now, but it was the place where I first be-
came aware of the excesses of big-time college foot-_
ball.

In subsequent years, Pitt had to decide which
direction to take with its. football team. For years, it
had been playing some of the top teams in college
football but did not have the team to match its
schedule. The university could either de-emphasize
football and play on the level of the Ivy League
schools or Carnegie Tech (now Carnegie Mellon), or

. 1;“,

it could set its sights on the Oklahomas and the
Alabamas and spend and recruit accordingly.

Unfortunately, in this graduate’s opinion, Pitt
selected the wrong direction.

The problem I have with this high-powered ap-
proach to football that began with the hiring of John-
ny Majors in that the football team's caliber and
reputation soared into the Top 20 land of The A5-
sociated Press, but the education has not climbed
into the upper competitive levels of Barron's Guide
to Colleges. Someday, when Pitt has basked long
enough in the glory of its football and basketball
teams, perhaps it will think of academics and inject
the same ‘quality and expenditure of effort and
finances into that area as it has into sports in the last
10 years or so.

This view might sound strange coming from some-
one who has spent most of his post-Pitt time writing
about athletes and the games they play, but perhaps‘
my job has given me greater insight into the excess-
es that abound on the so—called amateur level of
sports and the misguided importance placed on
sports over academics in college. If Pitt recruited
professors the way it has football coaches, perhaps
my feeling toward the athletic endeavor would be_ ,
different. *

Football was not the only phase of Pitt life that oc-I

cupied my attention in the late '50s. I.recalI with .
some humor how some people perceived my’
presence on The Pitt News as a radical influence (at

I least two other editors tried to prevent my being

named editor of the paper because they felt I was
too radical). Considering what was to follow in the. .
'60s on college campuses across the country, they

"didn't know the meaning of the word radical.

However outrageous I or any other member of the
paper might have seemed to some observers, there.
was a man who staunchly defended our right to
write..what we wanted. He was our adviser. Dr.

‘Donald Swarts, a man for whom I had great respect

and who gave me room to learn and practice the
skills I haveused in my career. He provided many
others with guidance, too, wherever they were
headed. E T *- J

By Jim O'Brien

Sports Editor, 1964

obody I know, out-
side of the Bible, has
lived to be 200 years
old. -

The University of Pittsburgh
has been around that long,
however, and has begun to
celebrate its bicentennial, cheat-
inga bit by a few months.

The school was started, first as
the Pittsburgh Business Academy
back in 1787, as the banners
throughout Oakland remind us
daily. Then, in 1819, the name
was changed to Western Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania (our teams
were called WUPs). And finally,
-in 1908, it became the Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh.

In 1926, on a rainy Monday
morning (Sept. 27 to be exact)
work began on the Cathedral of
Learning. Pittsburgh school chil-
dren were urged to send in a dol-
lar to buy a brick to helpbuild it.

More than anything, to all of
us, no matter our rank or our
place in the pecking order at Pitt,

 

-this 200th birthday should serve
as a reminder that the University
of Pittsburgh is bigger than any
and all of us. It is a legacy.

No matter what we are —— ad-
ministrator, instructor, staff mem-
ber or student —— we are simply
borrowing some of its precious
time.

For the majority of us, that
means four years. For starters,
anyhow. Some of us are lucky
enough to grab off another four
years and renew the rich ex-
perience that was there the first
time around. But even then, how
does eight years or 80 years
figure, or matter much, in the life
of something that has lasted and
prevailed nearly 200 years? —

Pitt is bigger than Bill Fralic, as
I reminded him many times, or
even Charles Smith.

Dan Marino, Hugh Green and
Tony Dorsett are doing their thing
somewhere else, like Fralic, but
the Cathedral of Learning is still
standing tall. Like no other school
building in the world.

42—story school building? The

I was so smart back I

then, so ignorant now.
What happened?
— lim O'Brien

Cathedral of Learning isn't eve_n_
leaning, unlike the Tower of Pisa,
which may crumble upon itself
any day now.

Walk through the first floor of
the Cathedral of Learning, that
Gothic chamber where you can
imagine prisoners chained to the
walls when you can't concentrate
on your Spanish studies under
those warm lights in its alcoves,
and you just know the building

' abounds with ghosts.

Great leaders and great
teachersland great students and
great secretaries, and some not-
so-great ingrates have spent time
there and worn its stone floor flat
and shiny. More are yet to come.

Sitting in an office at Pitt Stadi-
um, a funny place to work or to
write, and thinking about it brings
back many pleasant and not-so-
pleasant memories of my own
student days here from 1960
through 1964 —- back in the
medieval period. *

It was a fun place to be, right
from the start, when the Pirates
pulled off a miracle in the first
two months of school and won
the National League pennant,
and then the World Series, when
Bill Mazeroski hit his home run
and slew the mighty New York

_ Yankees in the seven games. That
" was at old Forbes Field, right

across the street from the student
union, once the Schenley Hotel,
now the beautifully refurbished
William Pitt Union.

I was there to help honor Steel-
ers’ owner Art Rooney and his
family, who honored us and en-
riched the grounds even more
simply with their humble
presences. And it, too, brought
back all the good times and the
bad times —- nostudent or scho-
lar ever experiences one without
the other. The grades, the girls,
the gurus, the good times and
Gustine’s (now Hemingway's),
the games, the girls, the tests,‘ The
Pitt News, WPGH (now WPTS),
The Owl (now Panther Prints).

I was so smart back then, so ig-
norant now. What happened?

There have been so many great

people who have graced this

place. I've written the school's
sports history, and Bob Albers has
written about the.whole shebang,
about all the significant things

that have happened here in a just— '

published history book that you
ought to pick up at the Pitt Book
Store.

' Some of the most famous peo-

ple who have been here were
and are athletes no matter how
much that might disillusion some
of our leading bookworms. Let
them be disillusioned. The truth
often hurts.

But even the jocks must take a
back seat to a scientist who
worked here.

Nobody ever didanything as
important at Pitt as did Dr. Jonas
Salk and a team that included
Julius Younger, L. James Lewis,
Byron L. Bennett, Percival I.
Bazeley and Lurich Krech (they
should retire their white lab
coats). They were doing research
here and, in 1955, they deve-
loped the anti-polio vaccine.

Nobody ever said anything
more significant than did Dr. Salk
when he said, "We have the

 O'Brien reminisces as university turns 200

serum.”

And, all of a sudden, kids and
their parents did not have to fret
when they went swimming on a
sultry summer day. They would
not have to worry about getting
polio being paralyzed or ending
up in a wheelchair. , '

Last spring, when I was playing
the Pied Piper to a group of area
grade school students and taking
them on a tour of our athletic fa-
cilities, taking them in and out of
Fitzgerald Field House and Trees
Hall, holding back the traffic on
Sutherland Drive and pointing

out Salk Hall. One of them held .
up his hand and asked, ”Why is

everything around here‘ named
after somebody?”

It reminded all of us that great
people have preceded us at the
University of Pittsburgh.

They have set high standards
for all of us.

Our football coach, Mike Gott-
fried, likes to talk about his
predecessors, great coaches like
Pop Warner, Jock‘ Sutherland,
John Michelosen, Johnny Majors,
and he reminds his troops that
they have a heritage to live up to.

» He also tells themnot to spend

their time, but to invest it. It is
good advice for all of us.

The bicentennial should be a
humbling experience for all of us
Pitt people. Hail to Pitt! Happy
200th Birthday!

to put the paper together until an ‘

editor-in-chief could be ap-
pointed.

In mid—October, I became
editor-in-chief, and I have to say
that this experience was both the
best and worst of my college
career. We didn't have problems
finding important issues to cover,

, thanks to the university's Five-

Year Plan and the threats of

. eliminating the Graduate School

of Public and International Af-
fairs, as well as the School of
Pharmacy.

Apartheid became another im-
issue as the Student
Government Board began efforts
to convince the administration to
divest from South Africa, and
many other student groups fol-
lowed suit. The editorials and let-
ters to the editor were impressive,
with students presenting strong
arguments against the university's
continued involvement when
other universities and major cor-
porations were beginning to
divest. ‘ _

' When the Black Action Socie-

ty requested that Louis Farrakhan '

be invited to speak on campus,
another controversy made head-
lines and filled the editorial
pages. Many students felt strong-
ly that their student activities fee
should notbe spent on such a
controversial (and to some, offen-
sive) speaker. Thelewish Defense

THE PITT NEWS ALUMNI REUNION, Friday, March 27, .1987

Urban ponders
the present paper

By Jim U rban
Editor-in-Chief, 1987

remember the first time
I ever saw The. Pitt
News. Today is four
days shy of being exact-
ly 10 years ago to the date. It was
Friday, April 1, 1977.
I arrived home _from elemen-

1 tary school. My mother had al-

ready made the trip from

I Greensburg to Oakland, so my
sister Anne, a second-year nurs-

ing student at Pitt, could come

 home for the weekend.

I saw a copy of The Pitt News
on the kitchen table as I walked
in the house. My sister had
brought it home. On its cover
was this man dressed in a suit and
tie. He had big bushy eyebrows
— nothing like this 12-year-old
had ever seen before. '

The setting he was standing in
was quite different also. This guy
— the one with the eyebrows —
was standing on top of the
Cathedral of Learning, holding
King Kong in his hand, and there
were airplanes flying above and
around him.

As it turned out, that man was
Dr. Wesley Posvar, president of
this university (see bottom right
of front cover). He would shake

 my hand six years later at the

Chancellor's picnic with the
same hand that he held the ape
with in 1977.

That was my first taste of The

I originally attended Pitt hoping
to pursue a career as a lawyer.
My pre-law major was political

 Pitt News’. Little did Iknow how .
" much this paper was going to in- '
' fluence my life in the future years.

science. I decided to bag that-

"idea after I sat through my first
American political process class.
The rest of my freshman year was
— to be honest —— a waste of time
and money. ‘

My sophomore year began
slowly. I didn't even read the
controversial Bill Fralic interview
in The Pitt News until about two
weeks after it was published. I
just didn't care. Eventually, I

heard all these wild things about I

it, so I got a copy off a kid down
the hall and read it.

At about the same time, half the
staff resigned, and that is when I
first walked into The Pitt News.

They were desperate for writers
— so desperate that they took me.

The following year, I was sports '

editor and this year, editor-in-
chief. Basically, The Pitt News

‘rescued me from being a waste A

of human flesh.
For three years, this paper has

V provided me with occupational

experience, a steady income,
plenty of good friends and even
more good times. '

I've spent all-expense paid
weekends in New York City,
Syracuse, Washington D.C. and
Boston.

I've met all kinds of interesting
people — from Woody Hayes,
the legendary Ohio State football
coach, to Spud Webb, the pint-
sized basketball player who won
the National Basketball Associa-
tion's slam dunk contest two
years ago. . J

Academically, The Pitt News
has also been beneficial. In my
four years at Pitt, I don't think that
I have turned in a paper for a
class that was not written either
on a Pitt News typewriter or the

i . newspaper's computer.

But in these four years, I wrote
more than class papers on the
fourth floor of the William Pitt
Union.

I wrote articles — lots of them.
Some were good, some were
bad. Some were written with
good judgment, others used bad
judgment.

Perhaps the one that will be

remembered by everybody is the
famous "Five ways to rattle Doug
West” article I wrotea year ago
(as an "inexperienced" junior) for
the Pitt-Villanova basketball
game.

The game was on a Friday
night. I was sitting in my apart-
ment drinking a beer with the

photo editor at the time, Chaz.

Palla. We were watching the
WTAE-TV 6 p.m. news. They
teased sports before they broke
for a commercial. The front page
of our sports section, with my ar-
ticle on it — bold headlines and
all — was flashed on the screen.
Bill Hil|grove's voice—over said
something like "Controversy at
Pitt  details when we come
backJ'.

I looked at Chaz. He looked at
me. I said, "Uh oh!"

Looking back, I'm not sure
what I was trying to do was
wrong, but I_think I could have

gone about it a little differently.

Jim Urban joined The Pitt News after reading Joe Zeff's controversial interview with Bill Fralic.

The intention was to make the
atmosphere at the_field house a
little more exciting than normal.
It was more exciting than normal,
but perhaps it was more danger-
ous for Doug West than normal,
too. -
As I have every other day that
I worked at The Pitt News, I
learnedrfrom that experience. We
handled it much better this year
when we had our hat issue.

The center spread of the paper
folded up into a hat that said "Go
Pitt, Beast-of the East, Beat Vil-
lanova!" It went over well with

the students. That was more the

type of response that I was look-
ing for.

Rollie Massimino still dislikes
me, so I guess first im'pressions
really are lasting.

When I officially become a Pitt
News alumnus, two weeks from
now, the thought of Massimino
hating me will be forgotten. More
pleasant memories will surface.

I'll remember the tri—weekly
editorial board meetings that
were often more hilarious than
serious. I'll also remember the
nightly trips to Peter's Pub (except
for Sundays — Peter's is closed)
during my junior year. But the
thing I'll remember the best is the
education I received at The'Pitt
News.

By the end of this term, I will
have over I20 academic, about
15 of which were worthwhile
credits (my writing classes and
Coach Joe DeGregorio's Basket-
ball I class). The rest of the credits
belonged to classes that just gave
me something to do outside The
Pitt News.

I went to college, butl learned
at The_Pitt News.
' Editor's note: jim Urban will
graduate in April from the
University of Pittsburgh. He has
worked at The Pitt News for
three years.

Markowitz  

My own mentor on the‘ staff was Ed Jensen, who had
gone into the service pratically as a kid; I believe he had
had to finish some high school after the war before he

I’ _ could enter Pitt. A good-looking, dapper guy, liberal (but

no world-saver), street-wise and intellectual both, an all-
‘hours raconteur and beer drinker, Jensen had what I

‘ would call great journalistic temperment, although miss-

ing thatlast degree of investigative bile that might have

 brought him the big prizes. Years leater, as the Post-

Gazette's correspondance in Harrisburg, he wrote more
illuminating (and subtly entertaining) copy than I would

ll _ havethought possible from that place. When he was dy-

ing of cancer, a number of people dropped in to see him

 at the house outside of Harrisburgthathe rented with
. his family. Confined to a wheelchair by then — his son -

or daughter would periodically hoist him up to a more
comfortable position .— he was still able to enjoy a laugh
and a smoke. He'd broken thecigarette habit sometime
previously, but when he came down‘ with the "big C,”
as he called it, despite that, he figured, hell, he might
as well puff away. He‘ had no complaints except for a
-small one, more or less over a matter of form: that the
then governor of Pennsylvania, no Jensen fan, hadn't
seen fit to come out and visit him anyway, a ranking
Capitol reporter bushwacked by the big C. "If Shapp’d
still ‘be there,” he said of a previous incumbent, "I
guarantee you'd see a helicopter come over those trees
and land right in the yard. That's just the kind of guy
he was.” And that's the best thing I ever heard about
former Gov. Milton J. Shapp.

i The big issue of the time was McCarthyism, that
elephantine effort to root out Communists from govern-
ment and, by extension, from any position of influence.
The bullying opportunism of Sen. McCarthy seemed to

almost every decent person a low, destrucive form of

villainy. One feature of it was a movement to make

.university faculties submit to "loyalty oaths," swearing ,

that they were not and never had been members of any
group seeking the violent overthrow of the U.S.
government. '

But_ that objection to loyalty oaths didn't satisfy ‘me
thenland doesn't satisfy me now. We weren't talking
about service in the government or in secret weapons
research, but in a univesity, a place of ideas. So I wrote
my own defense of academic freedom, a column which
was printed on the editorial page under the head, ("The
Real Issue." My lead was calculated to shock: "Com-
munists should be allowed to teach at universities.”

Well, the Cathedral did not quake on its foundations.
My column did get a mention + unfavorable — on the
local TV news, then in its infancy; it also scared up a
couple of letters from people who.saw red. Two of my
favoriteteachers read it and commented to me after class
about it. Miss Emily Irvine pretty much agreed, Dr. Ford
Curtis_thought I'd overstated thecase, but both gave the
flattering impression that, right or wrong, they liked see-
ing a student’ speak out on controversial matters. I
remember philosophical editor Dick Kovar observing

that, what the hell, if ever we were going to take stands

it might as well be in youth, for as we grew older we,
too, would inevitably move from left to right.

A But that will never happen to me, I thought. What else
could a decent man be but a liberal? In other words, in
favor of equal rights for everybody, black and white;
against ”big business” and for the common man and
his government; for freedom and against Communism
 well, yes, but even more against that narrow form of
anti-Communism that would restrict freedom of expres-
sion even as it resisted every effort to achieve reasona-
ble arrangements for peace with the Russians and the
beginnings of boundless world prosperity.

Looking back now, I wonder how legitimately liberal
I actually was. I.seems to me ‘that many of the ideas I

V I» expressed on The-Pitt News weren't really mine at all,

in the sense of deriving from. personal, direct experience

of the world. My head had be filled from books, lectures,
the intellectual currents of the time, all alight with gleam-
ing ideals available to any middle-class lad lucky enough
to have grown up with the right literature and without
any serious conflict or struggle.

Am I at least then, older and wiser, ready to recant
on "The Real Issue?" '

The funny thing is, no. I still believe that the value of
maintaining academic freedom outweighs any advantage
in being able to kick an occasional Communist off a
faculty. I can speakfrom experience, having run into the

I genuine article at least once, at New York University the

year after I left Pitt. She was an English professor, around

50, still kind of cute, with a minor reputation as a Green- -

wich Village poet. She told anecdotes about partying
with Edna St. Vincent Millay in the 19205, and she
pronounced the word "poem" in a way I can't resist —
"poyem." But by, was' she the Communist’s Commie.
She could put exploitation of the masses straight out of
left field in a discussion of the most ethereal poyem, but
I didn't think she advanced the party one inch. Her stu-
dents squirmed in class. They argued with her openly,
which she didn't seem to mind,-perhaps needing a cer-
tian amount of humiliation from fallow boys to steel her

for the possible future square—off against the unspeaka- '

ble senator.

These are matters of opinion, of course. It will be clear,
however, that no, I don't think I've moved that much
from left to right since leaving The Pitt News; rather, that
it seems to me the country which has been moving from
right to wrong. But maybe all old guys think something
like that. . ,

editor at the Creensburg Tribune-Review for the past
eight years. Prior to that, he was business editor for 13

nickname.

The fires of the '60s were only
banked, however. At Pitt, .a band
of student protestors gathered to
defend a much-criticized sociol-
ogy professor who claimed he
was being ousted for leftist polit-
ical views. The Pitt News editori-
al board entertained supporting
the re—accreditation of ROTC
but ultimately voted to continue
editorial opposition. I

But for most of the readers of
The Pitt News, the big issues
were still internal ones. Affairs of
the heart carried more weight
than affairs of state.

An example was the populari-'

tyof the classified ad drama of
Brad and Leslie
nonexistent students who con-
ducted a stormy, nonexistent rela-
tionship in The Pitt News
classifieds. They became so
popular that some students took
to placing their own classified

"ads, offering advice to Brad or

Leslie on their relationship.

By 1979 the trend was clear.
The seminal California ex-
perience was no longer Haight—
Asbury Street, but the parking lots
and Beer ’n’ Grills of Silicon
Valley.

Good grades were suddenly '

two-A

chic.

Chic was suddenly chic.

Motherjones and Rolling Stone
gave way to GQ and TAXI.

Could the start of healthy diets
be far behind?

Credit cards?

Mortgages?

How about  children?

The 1970s will not make a very-
tidy chapter, but the changes in
those years will stay with us. The
fact is that we still question
authority, even though we are
well—camouf|aged in the same

-suits. And we did get ex-

perienced, measured by the pub-
lic opinion polls of our

generation that sketch our skep-
ticism of Big Government, Big
Business, Big Media and Big
Religion.
. But the most interesting part is
just ahead  the 19905. When
weget our turn in the uncomfort-
able driver's seats of the country.
What are the kids going to sing
about us? What will we do when
they decide to occupy our com-
puter facility? Picket our region-
al office? Agitate to boycott our
company? Toss a bag of blood on
our spiffy foreign import car?
Call the cops, of course.
But before we unleash the law
on the miserable little miscreant,

why not drag out that dusty clip-
book of old Pitt News articles and

get back in touch? After all, it _

really won't be that long ago.

came the office joke as it changed
at least once a month.

There was one person, though,
who gave the paper consistency.
Mark Schneidmiller’s cartoons

appeared three daysper week V

from even before I started work-
ing at the paper. On the worst of
deadline nights, I always knew
that if nothing else, we would
have Mark's editorial cartoon that

often times said more than even

the longest article could. The en-
tire staff had respect for Mark's ta-
lent as a cartoonist as well as an
individual, and he became the
natural choice for managing
editor. . a
Mark died in January 1985, but
even his memory continued to
pull the staff together. There was
no question that everyone felt a
tremendous loss, and this emo-

tion that we shared helped us put
aside personal differences and
see each other in a different light.

I had the opportunity to spend
another year at The Pitt News af-

. ter my term as editor—in—chief. I

was victim of The Pitt News Syn-

. drome, and while I didn’tfai'l out

of school, it did take me an extra
term to graduate. *

I realized that the problems we

had when I was editor—in-chief’

were not very different from the
problems we were having the

following year. There was still the
’’revolving s_taff box,” and the

had a knack for breaking at the

inopportune moments just like
the old equipment. It also be-

Pitt basketball recruitcould use

some advice from fellow athlete  

You better get your tickets now
to see Pitt recruit Brian Shorter at
the Roundball Classic on April 3
at the Civic Arena because you
probably won't get a chance to
see him play for another year.

Judging from Shorter’s recent
SAT scores, which were only
”slightly better” than the 540 he
scored the first time, he will be
victimized by Propostion 48 and
have to sit out next season.

Maybe Shorter should get in
touch with Pitt football player
Adam Walker. Last year Walker,

, a running back from Steel Valley,

scored below the 700 required
minimum on the test but came
back strong the next time, adding
a ‘whopping 300 points to -his
original score. The NCAA disput-
ed Walker's score, and he still
had to sit out his freshman year.

But nobody expects Shorter’s
score, to improve 300 points;
rather, they want just enough im-

provement for him to be eligible .

to play. And not enough that the
NCAA will be snooping around
Mouth of Wilson, Va., where
Shorter attends high school.

°Reason No. 1,001 why

Charles Smith should stay for his

Paul Franklin, who wrote the

reasons Pitt was an attractive
place to see a game.

He even mentioned three local

0 Trivia Question — Who is
the only Pitt player to hold an in-
dividual record in Big East tour-
nament history?

F 0 Syracuse's Rony Seikaly has
played the best basketball of his
career in this year's NCAA tour-
nament. If he continues to do so
in the Final Four, and the Orange-
men win-, look for the 6-10 junior
to be a preseason first team All-
America candidate next year.

0 The only mistake Providence
made this season was its non-
conference schedule. Think how
much better prepared the Friars
would be now if they had played

somebody back in December,

rather than patsies such as Holy
Cross, Brown, Siena, Rider,
Howard, Maine and Hofstra.

Whew! How many easy Ws
does Rick Pitino want?

0 Many feel UNLV has one of
the better defensive teams in the
country, and a lot of that credit
goes to former Pitt head coach
Tim Grgurich. Grgurich has been
the defensive coach at UNLV for

Providence coach Rick Pitino has pointed his team the right way in the NCAA tournament.

perience for them.”

”We want them to have a good
time, but we also expect them to
concentrate on the game,” Boe-
heim said.

Big East rivals Providence,
28-5, and Syracuse, 30-6, meet in
the opening game of the Final
Four on Saturday. ‘The regular
season ended with UNLV ranked
No. l, Indiana No. 3, Syracuse
No. ‘l 0 and Providence out of the
standings, although getting a few
votes from pollsters.

Providence last beat Syracuse
13 seasons ago, the only victory
for the Friars in 17 meetings.

Tarkanian flew in ahead of his‘

team and went straight to a pre-
tournament press conference.
The other three coaches partici-
pated from their campus offices.
Las Vegas, 37-1, is picked to
win the title. Indiana, 28-4, is Tar-
kanian’s pick for the favorite’s
role. .
’’I’m really shocked that we're
the favorite. I look around, and
Indiana's a great basketball
team,” Tarkanian said. ’’I hope
those people picking us know

‘ 

We don't have that
much time for them _to
get out much. It's a life-
time experience for
them.

something we don’t know.

Knight has never hidden the
fact that he believes defense is the
way to win games. Only this sea-
son has Tarkanianfs defense been
mentioned.

”We’ve been, always, a great
defensive team,” Tarkanian said.
”The public looks at our scores
and says, ‘No defense.’

”We score a lot, and that's be-
cause we shoot it quick. We're
not into being patient.”

”Jerry has never been under-
stood as a coach, as I understand
him as a coach,” Knight said.
”l’ve always felt that basketball
starts with defense. I think his
trademark has been outstanding
defensive play.”

like but I don't feel they're the
best I've ever had” into the Final
Four.

Steve Alford, the Hoosiers All-
America guard, despite the fact
he was only able to manage two
points in the second half of their
game against LSU, is still the
team's main powerhouse. And,
believe it or not, against UNLV,
he should be able to roar, as long
as he can keep the advantage
over the Rebels’ spiking defense.

The one thing the -Hoosiers
have going for them is that they
are not a choke team —— they have

‘the help of an experienced coach

to guide them, and the players
themselves have the drive to
bring some power back into the
Big Ten. Don't classify them as an
also-ran team and certainly do
not write them off_.

0 Providence — Talk about a
sleeper team.
-?

The Friars are very much like
the film A Room With a View in
this year's Academy Awards race

_ — in a year with a Platoon and

a Hannah and Her Sisters, no-
body thought there would be any

room for the little guys. But there“

IS.

Everyone concerned was cut-
and-dry sure this spot would be
filled by the Georgetown Hoyas
by this time, but it was not to be.
Coach Rick Pitino’s team not only
upset the Hoyas’ plans but up-
rooted them. Perhaps we may be
seeing the advent of a new form
of Big East power.

In the Final Four, the Friars are

the dark horse team and a long I

shot to win. But hell, they just
may be on a roll. '
0 UNLV — The favorite, yes,
but do they really deserve their
status?
Freddie Banks, Armon Gilliam
and Gerald Paddio are all excep-

tional players, and the Rebel
team has a terrific defense, but
sometimes they just get damn

lucky. They play in the Pacific,

Coast Conference, notoriously
weak, and the hardest teams they
had to play all season were Tem-
ple, whom they only defeated by
a three—point shot at the buzzer,
and Oklahoma, who handed
them their only loss. '

Granted, Coach Jerry Tarkani-
an’s team did beat Iowa, but, un-
like Indiana, they still have not
risen to the ranks of not being a
choke team. '

They may just fizzle under the
Hoosiers’ press. _

A prediction for the champion
may be a little premature, but, be-
Iieve it or not, I'm going to say In-
diana, which is also my preferred
choice.

In fact, with the quality in-
volved this year, a victor may just
be too close to call.

HERSHEY, Pa. —— Aliquippa
will be playing in the PIAA boys
Class AAA basketball champion-
ship game for the second year in
a row Friday. But this time, the
Quips aren't surprised to find
themselves playing in the Her-
sheypark Arena.

The underclassmen-dominated
Quips from Beaver County were
unexpected finalists a year ago
when they advanced to the title
game despite finishing only‘
fourth in the District 7 (WPIAL)
playoffs. They wound up losing

- in Hershey to Allentown Central

Catholic 65-54.
Aliquippa was favored to
emerge as the Western regional
champion this season, and the
Quips, 31-1, came through, beat-
ing rival Ellwood City 51-43 in
overtime Tuesday to extend their
winning streak to 27 games.
”Last year we were just happy
tog__b_e there,” said Aliquippa
senior Mike Warfield. ”This year
we are going there to-win.”

Aliquippa and Eastern region-
_al cham ion York Catholic 33-0

 

  

have won 60 consecutive cam:-s,
between them and will play at 9
p.m. Friday in the fourth and fi-
nal title game of the day. York
Catholic got’ 22 points from
Robert Preston in beating Con-
estoga Valley 56-50 Tuesday for

p the Eastern title.

At 4 p.m., Kennedy Christian,
26-5, tries for its second consecu-
tive boys Class A championship
when it meets unbeaten Millers-
burg, 29-0. Girls’ title games find
Altoona, 28-2, and Downing-
town, 30-3, meeting in a Quad-
A rematch at 7 p.m., and Altoo-
na Bishop Guilfoyle, 25-6, play-
ing Riverside, 28-0, for the AA
title at 2 p.m.

Unlike Aliquippa, the domi-
nant team in its area during the
regular season, Kennedy Christi-
an wasn't expected to enjoy

another shower of Hershey's Kiss- -

es this season. The Golden Eagles

’ lost four of their five starters from

a year ago, when they finished
29-1 by beating Bristol 55-44 in
the title game,

After finishing as the District 10
runnerup, Kennedy Christian be-
gan playing’ its best bask_e_t_b_all of

worship

 

Aliquippa aims for Class AAA title

the season in the PIAA tourna-
ments as senior Ed Yoursh deve-
loped a hot shooting hand.
Yoursh, a 5-10 senior forward,
scored 23 points Tuesday in a
55-53 victory over Monessen and

is averaging 17 points per game,

including a 28 ppg average dur-
ing the playoffs.

”lt’s been a trademark of ours
all season to , win the close
games,” said Eagles coach Joe
Votino. ‘'1 had some job offers
over the summer, one from a
Quad—A school in Philadelphia,
but I felt with some hard work we
could go back [to Hershey].”

Millersburg defeated Northeast
Bradford 72-62 in the Eastern
regional finals and will be one of
three unbeaten teams playing
Friday.

Altoona, meanwhile, wasn't
able to defend its 1986 USA To-
day national championship, but
the Lady Lions earned the right to
defend their state title when they
beat—Penn Hills 66-56 Tuesday in
the girls AAAA West final. Altoo-
na recovered from a 32-30 half-
time deficit last year to beat
Downingtown 59-40 for the PIAA
title.

Phillies trade outfielder Redus

By Ralph Bernstein
AP Sports Writer

CLEARWATER, Fla. — The
Philadelphia Phillies Thursday
traded outfielder Gary Redus to
the Chicago White Sox for right-
handed pitcher Joe Cowley.

Phillies President Bill Giles said

_ he wasn't happy about dealing
' Redus, but that an injury to right-

handed pitcher Kevin Gross con-
cerned the club.

Gross suffered a herniated disc
early. in spring training and,
although he was making his regu-
lar exhibition game appearances,
he still was in pain.

Team physican Dr. Phillip Ma-

’ rone said this week Gross could

be bothered by the injury all
season.

Giles said the Phillies would
replace Redus as a reserve center
fielder with rookie Chris James,
who had been ticketed for the
club's Portland farm team in the
Pacific Coast League.

Redus, 30, was acquired by the
Phillies at the December 1985
winter ‘baseball meetings.

He hit .247 with 11 home runs

‘ and 33 RBIs last season. He was
, .on the disabled list from April 28
to July 1, undergoing arthroscop- _

added five innings, giving up six

ic surgery for removal of bone
chips from his right elbow.

Cowley, 28, topped the White

Sox staff last season with 11 vic-
tories, including a no-hitter
against the California Angels. He
had an 11-11 record with a 3.88
earned run_average after starting
‘the season in the minors.

Cowley came to the majors
with Atlanta in 1982 after seven

,minor league seasons. He was

returned to the minors in 1983,
and came up with the New York
Yankees from Columbus in 1984.

Cowley was 9-2 witha 3.56
ERA for the Yankees in 16 games
in 1984 and 12-6 with a 3.95
ERA in 1985. New York sent
Cowley to the White Sox with
catcher Ron Hassey for pitcher
Britt Burns and two minor
leaguers last year.

Giles said the Phillies felt
Cowley gave the club five pitch-
ers with a potential to win 15 or
more games-

He listed‘ Bruce Ruffin, Don
Carman, Shane Rawley, Cowley
and Gross if he's healthy.

Giles said the Phillies weren't
finished in the trade market.

”We’re still looking for a
Iefthand reliever,” Giles said.

The Panthers’ other opponents
in the tournament included
Princeton and Central Florida. In

‘the opening game, the Panthers

lost 9-5 to Central Florida, despite
a first inning homerun by West-
wood. Jay Duderstadt and Claus
also had good games, as the two
sophomores went two for three,
and Brush and Sean Carroll both
went two for four. The Panthers
dropped two more to Central
Florida,. 16-6 and 6-4. Freshman
Matt Bianco hit the ball well in
the 6-4 loss, going two for four‘
with aldouble.

Brian Lohman hit the ball well
in the two games, going two for
four in the first and three for five

in the second. Overall, he had 13

hits, seven RBIs and four extra
base hits, including a homerun,
to lead the Panthers with a .464
batting average. He was the only
Panther ‘named to the all-
tournament team.

. The Panthers’ three victories
came against a scrappy Princeton

“Right now there aren't any out
there available.”

Manager John Felske said
Cowley sets up the pitching rota-

. tion. ’’All I have to decide is a

10th pitcher,” Felske said.
That 10th pitcher will come

from among Mike Maddux, Fred

Toliver and Mike Jackson.
Felske said the Phillies had

talked to a lot of people about .

Cowley.

”We heard a lot of good things
about his ability,” Felske said.

Giles said the acquisition of
Cowley ended any effort to ob-
tain Alejandro Pena from the Los
Angeles Dodgers.

”It was between Cowley and

- Pena,” Giles said. ”.We felt Pe-

na’s health was a risk.”

Pena still is rehabilitating from
arthroscopic surgery on the right
shoulder. _

The trade of Redus wasn't a

surprise, since the Phillies offered.

him at the December winter
meetings, but found no takers.

Despite missing 72 games on

the disabled |ist,‘Redus recorded

‘ career highs with 22 doubles and

33 extra base hits. He stole 25

bases in 32 attempts (78 percent)

and scored 10 game-winning ’

runs,

team. The Panthers were up 1 1-3
after five innings, but Princeton
gave them a scare as they—at-
tempted a comeback. Pitt was
able to hold them off however,
winning 12-11.

The second meeting between
the two teams was also a close
call with Pitt winning 7-6. Gregg
Lamanti went three for four, with

a homerun and two RBIs. West— .

wood also had three hits and Loh-
man two.»The winning pitcher
was Keith Shuster, and Lohman

recorded his second save of the -

yeah

In the final game of the tourna-
.ment, the Panthers once again
faced Princeton in a battle for
third place. Pitt came out ahead
by a score of 7-5. Shuster got his
second win of the year, coming
in to relieve Gavran. Lohman and
Duderstadt had two hits apiece
and Mike Claus got the game
winning RBI on a fielder’s choice
in the sixth inning-
