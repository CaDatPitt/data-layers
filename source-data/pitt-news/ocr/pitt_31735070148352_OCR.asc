A group of 50 people marched
through the streets of South Oak-
land Tuesday night to ﬁght back

against women’s fears of walking _

alone at night.
During their seventh annu-

al Take Back the Night march, ‘

Campus Women’s Organization
sought to raise awareness about
sexual and domestic violence and
to remind people that rape is not
just a women’_s issue, but one that
affects everyone. The group made
sure to have their voices resonate
through the South Oakland com-
munity as they marched on South
Bouquet Street and Oakland Av-
enue at 8 p.m. .

Chants such as “Pittsburgh
unite, take back the night” and
“Heygmister, get your hands off
my sister” brought students out
on their porches, while others
peered out their windows.

Tracey Hickey, the CWO of-
ﬁce administrator, said that the
march mimics the demonstra-
tions that were popular during
the second wave of feminism in
the 1960s, which were held to
protest the fact that women were
afraid to walk the streets alone
at night.

“At first there were some ex-
clusion issues, but it became a
lot more inclusive as awareness
grew,” she said about the march-
es, which used to be for women
only but have since welcomed
male and transgender allies.

After the half—hour march, the
group came back to the William
Pitt Union for bystander train-
ing.

E-books
increase
piracy

Michael Ringling
Staff Writer

The increase in electronic books
on PittCat+ provides students
with an alternative to search-
ing the stacks at the Hillman
Library, but the books are caus-
ing some problems for librar-
ies, publishers and distributors.
Pitt’s University Librarylsystem
has increased its journal access
more than 200 percent since it
began purchasing electronic re-
sources about 15 years ago. But the
increase in availability of e-books
has created new dilemmas for
publishers and libraries, includ-
ing how to price the books and
combat piracy.

Multiple students can access
e-books simultaneously by logging
into sremote.pitt.edu, but some
publishers have begun to set limits
on how many students can gain
access at one time. '

The publisher Harpercollins
implemented a policy in 2010 that

requires libraries to repurchase ‘

e-books after every 26 lends. A
statement from March 1 of that
year said that the company was
concerned with selling e-books to

libraries in perpetuity because it

would lead to a decrease in book
sales and hurt the industry in a
number of other ways.

“[It] would undermine the
emerging e-book ecosystem, hurt
the_ growing e-book channel, place
additional pressure on physical

bookstores, and in the end lead to a decrease
in book sales and royaltiespaid to authors,”
the statement said.

The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh has
about 500 HarperCollins e—books in its col-
lection, butafter the 2010 change in the
publishing company’s policy, Sarah Beasley,
the library’s coordinator of e—resources,
said that they will no longer purchase from

“Before we invest more money, we are
waiting to see where they are going with
the policy,” she said.

Pitt also carries HarperCollins e—books,
but Rush Miller, the director of Pitt’s Uni-
versity Library System, did not know exactly
how many of the company’s e—books Pitt
currently has available.

When it comes to the cost that libraries
pay for e—books, distributors, publishers
and the libraries will not comment on spe-
ciﬁc prices.

Paul B. Kohberger ]r., the head of Pitt’s
Technical Services, said in an email that
due to licensing considerations, which is
included in the contractual agreement be-
tween publishers and libraries, he could

’ not provide speciﬁc costs or discounts for

electronic resources.

David Burleigh, director of marketing at
Overdrive, a global distributor of e-"books
for more than 1,000 publishers, said that
he would not disclose the prices libraries
have to pay for e—books because “publicly
we don’t talk about pricing strategies.”

Erin Crum, the vice president of corpo-
rate communications for HarperCollins Pub-
lishers, said in an email that, “The e-book
price is typically 20 percent lower than the
physical book and the e-book priceamatches
to the current format in the market,” but
would not give a speciﬁc title or price.

In addition to pricing questions, publish-
ers said they are also facing more piracy

Andi Sporkin, vice president of com-
munications at the Association of American
Publishers, said -that combating piracy has
become ﬁnancially straining on publishing
companies.

“I’m not saying piracy didn’t exist 10
years ago, but the Internet has made it a
global business,” she said.

Sporkin added that a survey by Associa-
tion of American Publishers showed that
eight publishers had collectively spent

nearly $800,000 to cover monitoringser- ‘

vices provided by third parties in the last
two years. O

“Some publishers additionally have com-
mitted one or more in-house staff — in some

if cases hiring additional staff — to deal with
piracy,” Sporkin said in an email." “These

are costs that were unanticipated ﬁve years
ago  these are costs that are related to the

' digital format.”

Despite these publishing industry issues,

V Miller said he believes e—books are a strong

investment. But he did acknowledge the
current confusion in the publishing mar-
ketplace.

b “There are lots of models and lots of plat-
forms, _and they are -not consistent,” Miller
said. “Thedifﬁculties is that with different

policies and different platforms it’s easy to

be confused.”

Miller said that in the long run, the cost
was “probably lower” for an e-book but did
not give speciﬁc numbers. He said that the
lower cost stems from the lack of catalog-
ing costs and costs of replacing damaged
or misplaced books. And when e-journals
ﬁrst came out, the library saved 10 percent
of the original print edition by subscribing
to the electronic version.

' “It allowed us to buy more content

fwith the same amount of money,” he said.

Event educates students
on defense against assault

March 4 1

ielle Bissert said that a representative from
Pittsburgh Action Against Rape spoke to
the audience about what to do in a situa-
tion where one suspects a sexual assault
might occur. If someone sees a friend in
what appears to be a dangerous situation,
the representative suggested distracting
the assailant, appealing to their better
nature or teaming up with other people
‘to talk theiperson out of it.
The participants then split up into
groups to act out scenarios.
‘ “It was really funny to see everybody
act things out, but I could really see that
stuff happening at a party,” Bissert said.
“I’m sure everyone’s been at a party and
been in an uncomfortable situation, and
I think this could really help.” . L
Tim Craft, a lab technician for the an-

thropology department and one of the
men at the rally, said he marched because
CWO does a ‘lot of work with the Rainbow
Alliance, an organization that he is a part
of.

He said that he believes an event like
this shows victims of sexual violence that
“there’s resources out there, and people
willing to help.” ;

Hickey said one in four women and one
in seven men are victims of sexual violence
and that in a typical academic year, three
percent of women on college campuses
report surviving rape or attempted rape.

“If that thought freaks you out and
pisses you off, then you should be here,”
Hickey said. .

Club sport teams tomeet on opening field access

Mary Mallampalli
For The Pitt News

The Pitt men’s club soccer team may gain
support from other clubs in their campaign
to gain increased on-campus ﬁeld access.
That is", if board member Ryan Gayman’s
plan succeeds.

Gayman announced at the Student Gov-
ernment Board meeting Tuesday night that

he has organized a meeting with represen— ‘

tativesfrom club sports teams to discuss

expandingtheir access to campus varsity‘
ﬁelds. Gayman said the meeting will be
held Monday at 7 p.m. but has not yet set
a location.

Last month, the president of Pitt men’s

club soccer came to SGB asking for the
board’s help in protesting for access to the
Ambrose Urbanic Field. The ﬁeld, along
with the entire Petersen Sports Complex, is
currently reserved for varsity sports because
of private funding.

Athletic Department spokesman E._].

the Athletic Department decided that the
Petersen Sports Complex would be used
only for varsity competitions. He said that
they opened Trees Field for recreational
sports.

Gayrnanhas said that he plans to con-
front the department once he has garnered
enough support from other club teams.

“That’s the beauty of why I am an elected
ofﬁcial. What I would like to see is student
organizations meeting with administrators
so we can have a discussion that leads to

He said that he sent out an email to all

Affirmative action
an unfair policy

Get ready for an interesting realiza-
tion: Aﬂirmative action might be on
its last leg. ' ’

The New York Times reports
that Abigail Fisher, a white stu-
dent who says she didn’t get in to
the University of Texas because of

her race, is pushing her case to the _

Supreme Court. If the justices de-
cide to hear it, they’d make a ﬁnal
decision byjune. There’s not much
time now before public education
could drastically change right in
front of us.

We hope it does.

Affirmative action, a policy that
takes race and other factors into
account in order to beneﬁt under-
represented groups, allows public
universities to sort students by race.
This allowance is an interesting one.
Government ofﬁcials ordinarily

cannot make decisionsbased on _

race because it is unconstitution-
al. And diversity is the compelling
factor that, /according to Grutter v.
Bollinger, a 2003 Supreme Court

 decision, makes afﬁrmative action

constitutional.

A simple checkbox could not
possibly be enough to assess wheth-
er someone comes from a disadvan-
taged background — or how well
they would diversify a school.

What someone looks like doesn’t
determine what’s going on in his or
her head. The idea that the color of
someone’s skin somehow stimulates
intellectual and academic diversity

on campus just doesn’t add up to _

us.

A student’s academic qualiﬁca-
tions, character and drive to suc-
ceed are what should inﬂuence ad-
missions staff decisions. And yes,
those criteria include overcoming

adversity, excelling in a school with -

limited resources and prioritizing
education in an impoverished en-
vironment.

No “race” checkbox can indicate
a student’s worth. If affirmative ac-
tion is ruled illegal and those check-

boxes disappear, public universities .

might see less physical diversity.
Vikram Amar, a law professor
at the University of California, Da-
vis, told The New York Times that
diversity in his state’s universities
has dwindled. California declined

_ to take race into account inadmis-
Jsions when Grutter v. Bollinger al-

lowed —— but didn’t require —- states
to make that decision. He said the
proportion of blacks dropped from
ﬁve to seven percent to about three
to four percent. '

But we think a better way to
combat that lack of diversity is for

-universities to assess socioeco-

nomic status and a combination of
variables such as income, wealth
and place of residence. That way,
students can represent their actual
lives and universities can increase
diversity without racial judgment.
Take the way a person looks out of
the picture. Is he or she a good ﬁt
for the school? Okay. Is he or she
at a genuine disadvantage? Got it.
Done. Those in charge of admis-
sions shouldn’t need to know what
a student looks like in order to en-
courage diversity on campus.
Instead, they need to ask the

tough questions, because one check- «
box that doesn’t indicate character V

makes for an uneven playing ﬁeld.

Students can use essay space
toindicate to admissions commit-
tees that they have a passion for
education and would be able to di-
versify a university’s campus with
their unique views of the world.
And students who might be more
privileged have the same amount
of space to show what they’d con-
tribute as well. ‘

It’s all about equality and fair-
ness, and affirmative action is simply
unfair to certain races. Why should
colleges be able to group students
by race and use this knowledge to
decide which are better than oth-

ers? At face value, the policy seems

racist itself.

There’s institutionalized racism .

at every level of our society. But set-
ting a preference for those who are

historically disadvantaged —— and

by all means have hurdled the gap
of inequality — only encourages the
same,_prejudiced mindset affirma-
tive action tries to prevent.

The New York Times says that
there?s pretty much no way for
Fisher to know that she was denied
admission because of her race. But
we think students shouldn’t have to
ponder their race’s weight on their
admission in the first place.

A checkbox simply isn’t the
best measure of academic qualiﬁ-
cation. I -

The Moustache Column of America dissects a hip website and concludes the unthinkable.

 
 
 
 

Oliver Bateman
Columnist

As many of our more astute read-
ers undoubtedly know, there’s this
really popular website called Stuff
White People Like. It has begotten
a couple of books that appear to
sell reasonably well on amazon.
com (where white people like to
shop), and we think there’s a good
chance it will become a movie star-
ring Shia LaBeouf as a white guy
(which white people would wait
to watch on Netﬂix or Qwikster
orwhatever it’s called these days)
or a CBS sitcom starring Matthew
Perry as awhite guy (which white
people would refuse to watch if it
were ﬁlmed using a multi-camera
setup or had a laugh track).

It’s pretty obvious, then, that
Stuff White People Like is some-
thing white people like. In fact,
given its smashing success, it’s

probably safe to say that it’s some-
thing that at least a few white
people love. So why hasn’t Stuff
White People Like published an
entry about itself? Why haven’t
its editors —- in the interest of
obviating any charge of hypocrisy

from hot college comedy critics-

like the Moustache Column of
America —- deigned to discuss
how much white people like pok-
inggentle fun at themselves in
a way that nevertheless fails to
shake their smug sense of cultural
superiority? _

Because there’s no need. Fac-
ing up to the facts isn’t among all
that cool stuff that white people
like. Instead, it’s something that

many white people actively refuse

to do. How else could one explain
the dysfunctional, implicitly race-
based American criminal justice
system described with such elo-
quence and conviction in Michelle
Alexander’s recent book, “The

New Jim Crow”? Might this also
help us understand the lack of na-
tional outrage over the genocide
in Rwanda 20 years ago? At any
rate, all we know for sure is that
facing up to the facts isn’t nearly
as fun as facing one of those styl-
ish HD screens popularized by the
late, lamented — at least on the
Twitter feeds of millions of white
people — Thomas Edison of our
age, Steve Jobs.

Nor is that wretched old Tea
Party — which is composed almost
entirely of angry white people —
among the various iPhone apps
and kombucha teas that white
people like. Most people in the
sophisticated Stuff White People
Like reading audience wouldn’t
be caught within 50 miles of one
of these wingnuts. Even if their
outrage is genuine and many of
their complaints are legitimate,
such loopy moonbats are beneath

mockery. With their pitchforks and mis-
spelled protest signs and silly Walmart “USA
#1” trucker hats (an item that hasn’t been
liked by discerning white people since 2005
or so), they’re a reminder of how déclassé
white people used to be before they became
couth and started liking great stuff.

No, these readers need nothing more
than a tame critique of their slavish wor-
ship of expensive pug dogs and the bland
comedy of noted ginger and failed “Tonight
Show” host Conan O’Brien. They want, to

"quote Friedrich Nietzsche, “a little poi-

son now and then that makes for pleasant
dreams — and much poison at the end for
a gentle death.” Stuff White People Like is
therefore the perfect solution to a problem
of no importance whatsoever: How should
people who have discovered happiness —
their pug dogs, Stevejobs-inspired screens,

Conan O’Brien quips — pass the time? For
these people, the hard questions posed by
the union organizers of the 1930s and the
urban radicals of the 1960s are no more.
“What is quaint and vintage and now and
with it and hopefully on sale — relatively
speaking — at Anthropologie? Where is the

’ artisanal chocolate? What is going on back

in Williamsburg or Portland or somewhere
like that?” V i
In other words, Stuff White People Like
writes stuff that the Moustache Column of
America loathes. That ,doesn’t mean we
haVen’t laughed at it —— man, we’,ve laughed
at plenty of bad jokes, from the brahsome »

Dane Cook’s ridiculous gyratiolnls to that

genuinely awe-inspiring scene where the
nerdy kid humps the apple pie. But this V

clere, much like most of the stuff it skewers. V

indulges time-wasting

It’s not controversial or soul-crushingly sad
or outré — not that all humor should be,
but good humor almost always is — and
amounts to nothing morethan a barrage
of ostensibly self—deprecating jokes at the
expense of pseudo-cynical readers who
are always in on the gag, always ready for

all-American boyjohn Krasinski’s knowing V

Maybe fertility is something that many
white people don’t like. All we can state with

that there will eventually be fewer white
people around to like all this worthless stuff
and then giggle along to blog entries about

Pittsburgh fans overrated

MCT Campus

Despite their reputation for being loud and intimidating, Steelers fans ranked 21st in the NFL in 2006
according to the American City Business Journals.

Greg Trietley
Senior Stajf Writer

I had been told that the fans of Pitts-
burgh’s professional sports teams
are loud, passionate and one—of—a—
kind, but I have yet to witness this
at a game.

I ﬁnally attended my ﬁrst Pen-
guins game at the Consol Energy
Centerthis past weekend. The Pen-
guins had a primetime date with the
Buffalo Sabres, a team with Stanley
Cup aspirations thanks to a summer
spending spree. The Sabres were a
marquee opponent on a Saturday
night.

I wanted loud Penguins fans
screaming in my ears for 60 min-
utes. I hoped the fans around me
would lose their voice by the sec-
ond period. When Pittsburgh cut
Buifalo’s lead to one, I expected an
atmosphere you "would only ﬁnd
during a third period, down—a—goal
hockey game.

What did I get? The quietest
crowd I’ve ever not heard.

Whenjames Neal scored his ﬁfth
goal of the season in the second pe-
riod, half of the lower bowl remained
seated. Momentary noise brought
on by high-deﬁnition scoreboard
animations died every time the puck
dropped and the graphics stopped,
even when Pittsburgh went on the
power play trailing by a goal in the
ﬁnal minute of regulation.

The last team with a fanbase that
quiet moved to Winnipeg.

Fans in the corridors looked like
extras from “The Walking Dead,”
their faces pale and expressionless,
their lips softly mouthing, “When is
Sidney Crosby returning?”

Sometimes I can’t help but think
most71Penguins fans are really just
Crosby. fans. When he’s out, crowd
noise evaporates.

Andthe Consol Energy Center is
too darn cozy. Give me a seat with
a rusty ~:nail piercing through it so I
have fa“ stand the‘ whole game. Give
me a low ceiling so cheers from the
opening puck drop reverberate
throughovertime. Consol has no
character.

While I appreciate the glitz and
glamour of a new rink, what has
happened to us? Seats so cushy I
think I’m at Brookstone? Strobe

. lights? Maroon 5 during commer-

cial breaks?

A woman ﬁve rows in front of me
spent a portion of the second period
taking photos of the ribbon banner.
I can’t comment on what the season-
ticket holders in my row did, since
the three to my left and two to my
right didn’t show up.

It’s the third home game of the
year! It’s the weekend! It’s against
Buffalo!

Success has made the Penguins
fans in attendance apathetic.

And this phenomenon travels
across Pittsburgh sports. Steelers
fans at Heinz Field aren’t exempt
from criticism. People hear about the
hard-hitting, smash—mouth identity
of the team’s defense and wrongly
assume that the narcissistic," prissy
fanbase shares that persona.

Take away exorbitant second-
hand ticket prices and dish towels,

Pitt Crewf to

compete in Boston

Jasper Wilson
Staff Writer

Members of Pitt Crew will travel
to Boston on Saturday to compete
in largest two-day rowing event in
the world.

After performing well at the An-
nual Head of Ohio Regatta three
weekends ago, Pitt Crew will look to
build on that success when it sends
four boats to the invitation-only
competition known as the Head of
the Charles Regatta.

Club president Lars Johnson, a

senior, said the Head of the Charles
is the most important event of the
fall season for Pitt rowers.
I The Head of the Charles website
said that “more than 8,000 athletes
from around the world compete in
55 different race events.” In 1997,
the Regatta expanded to a two-day
event that more than 300,000 peo-
ple arrive to watch each year.

The Charles gives the team the
opportunity to prove its worth
against top college rowing pro-
grams that recruit for crew, John-
son said.

Pitt Crew’s status as a club sport
prevents it from recruiting student-
athletes, and traditionally, a large
number of the rowers don’t come to
Pitt with rowing experience.

Voystock said that other teams
often write off Pitt Crew because
of its status as a club sport. But the
program has shown time and again
that it can compete with and even
beat schools that are able to recruit
rowers.

Because Pitt Crew is a club pro-
gram, it chooses which regattas -
or series ofboat races —— it competes

’ in unless the regatta is invitation

only. Because of this setup, there
are hardly ever the same schools
competing at each regatta.

Boats are single sex and compete
separatelyin a variety of divisions
depending on the regatta.

Two men’s varsity boats got in-
vited to Boston: one club boat and
one collegiate.'On the women’s side,
one lightweight and one collegiate
boat — both varsity —- were in-
vited.

Races designated as collegiate
restrict entry to college rowing pro-
grams. While races designated as
club or open do not have any entry
restrictions, lightweight races re-
quire that each member of a boat
weigh less than 160 pounds for
men and 130 for women. Fall crew
races are 6,000 meters long and
have staggered starts.

Pitt Crew consists of two main:
groups: varsity and novice. Varsity
consists of students who have had
more than a year of rowing experi-

« ence.

Novice rowers have ayear or less
of rowing experience. They train
and row separately from the varsity
group.

Varsity consists of 31 men and
women, 26 of whom had no prior
rowing experience before coming to
Pitt. The novice club has 30 men and
women, 27 of whom had no prior
rowing experience, bringing the
total number to 53 novices out of
61 crew members.

Johnson, who had no experi-
ence with crew before coming to
Pitt, sees the numbers as a source
of pride.

“I deﬁnitely think it’s a big point
of pride for us,” he said. “We can
take literally nothing, no experi-
ence, and foster competitive row-

9!

BPS.

Andrew Voystock, the club’s vice" "

president, who also came to Pitt
with no rowing experience, echoed
Johnson’s sentiment, saying that
he is proud that the club develops
its athletes.

Voystock, a junior, said that the-.

young Pitt rowers are committed to
their development. ‘
“We keep getting these novice
classes that are really dedicated and
are working really hard and end up
working up to the standards of be-

ingavarsity who rows against [Divi— if

sion 1] athletes and can beat them,”
Voystock said.

Freshmen who are experienced
in the sport before arriving on cam-
pus can choose whether they want

to row with varsity or novice row---A

ers.
Johnson and Voystock will row

Heinz Field not intimidating

Trietley < 7 -

l and what do Steelers fans have? A quiet and

unintimidating Heinz Field. Plenty of yellow
seats were visible in the fourth quarter of a
one—score game againstjacksonville on Sun-
day. I don’t care that the Steelers are supposed
to beat the Jaguars. I don’t care that it’s only
October. It’s not an excuse for a bad crowd.
In 2006 American City -Business Journals
noted that many season—ticket holders don’t
bother showing up for unimportant ‘games,
and it ranked the Steelers’ fanbase 21st in the
NFL (behind Cleveland, Baltimore and Cin-
cinnati). H
_ I feel sorry for the Pittsburgh die—hards
that want to attend games but can’t because
a season—ticket holder wanted to leave at half-

‘ time, and another wantéd $200 for a seat in

the bleachers.
For many, the main reason to attend a Steel-
ers game is to brag to friends that they went

to a Steelers game.

But it’s not all bad news for the quiet fans
of Pittsburgh’s professional teams. At least
they’re not the Pitt football “high-octane”
student section, which borders on shameful
every week and is about as energetic as the
team’s offense this year.

Last month, Pitt led Notre Dame by ﬁve at
the start of the fourth quarter. On Saturday,
Pitt trailed Utah by a safety with 10 minutes
left. In both cases, half of the student section

poured to the exits after “Sweet Caroline,”
an awful, forced tradition that should be left
behind with the Big East.

To the early-exiters, why do you come?
Why do you wake up at the crack of dawn, bus
to the North Shore,  in line and ﬁght for
lower bowl seats if you’re only there to sing a
song your grandmother loves?

You know how long a football game lasts.
Did you think the South Florida game would
wrap up early? Pitt beat down a ranked oppo-
nent on national television, and ESPN cut to a
student section of about 100 true fans.

Don’t come hungover. Don’t pour vodka
into an iced teabottle because you think you’re
clever. Don’t wear a vibrant “Love Pink” hoodie
when you should know by now to wear blue or
gold. Learn to keep a beat. If you leave early,
you deserve to be heckled and jeered worse
than any West Virginia or Penn State fan. At
least they ﬁll their student sections, where
games are all—day celebrations.

One attendant — Iwon’t call him a fan -

headed for the exits early in the fourth quarter,

against Notre Dame, but he stopped on his way
out. It wasn’t because the Fighting Irish were
driving to take the lead. No, it was ‘ because
“Party Rock Anthem” came on, and he wanted
to dance to it before he left.

Just go. And for the sake of everyone, don’t
comeback. - H

Club team competes    

Crew < 7

on the club four boat, led by Sam Nardone
in the stroke seat — the ﬁrst person rowing
that sets the pace for the others — that will
return to Boston after having missed out on
automatic qualiﬁcation by narrow margins
last year. A four boat seats four people.

Pitt ﬁnished 31 out of 60 boats in the club
four race in last year’s Head of the Charles
Regatta with a time of 19:16.52. Only the top
half of ﬁnishers received an automatic bid to
this year’s competition.

The boat didn’t lose any rowers to gradu-
ation and found itself on the lucky end of a
lottery that gave it a place in this year’s Head
of the Charles, setting the stage for a chance
at redemption.

After losing two" rowers to graduation,
the collegiate four boat — led by Peter Al-
ter — began this year by ﬁnishing second
in one of the men’s open four races at the
Head of the Ohio with a time of 17:07.66. This
boat competed in the collegiatefour race in
Boston last year, coming in 12th with a time
of 18:37.76.

Despite losing a rower from last year’s
squad, which placed ﬁfth at Head of the
Charles, the women’s lightweight boat has
continued its streak of success.

This year’s squad won the lightweight

against NCAA opponents

women four race at the Head of the Ohio with
a time of 17:57.00. Cara Massarelli moved
to the stroke seat to ﬁll the spot left by the
graduated rower.

Now the lightweight boat will look to once
again excel in Boston and improve on last
year’s time of 18:51.93.

Women’s collegiate four boat came in 15th
out of 30 boats lastyear at Head of the Charles
with a time of 22:00.91.

Junior Mariah Blake sits in the stroke seat
this year as they look to beat last year’s 15th
place ﬁnish. At the Head of the Ohio, the boat
placed ﬁfthin the women open four race with
a ﬁnish of 18:25.01.

Blake believes the team can improve on
last year’s ﬁnish. In last year’s Head of the

‘ Charles, the boat was going around a turn

and got “t—boned” by another, causingit to
go off course.

Blake had no prior crew experience before
she came to Pitt. In fact, she “didn’t even know
what a crew team was.” She learned about
crew during the Activities Fair her freshman
year. She saw people walking around with oars

A and thought it would be a fun activity to try.

“We have people who join the team as ju-

' niors and seniors just for their novice years

and have a blast,” Blake said. j

FOOTBALL

Revis, Mccoy lead teams to victr

Mike Furlong
Staff Writer

In week six of the NFL, two former Pitt Pan-

thers carried their struggling teams to must-

win victories over division opponents.
During Monday Night Football, in a match-

up between division rivals the New Yorkjets ’

and Miami Dolphins, Darrelle Revis (Pitt cor-
nerback, 2004-2006) did what he does best.
After a week when Brandon Marshall claimed
that he could do whatever hewanted to thejets,
including getting ejected in the second quarter,
he appeared beached on Revis Island.

Revis isolated Brandon Marshall tl1rough—
out much of the game by playing a physical
bump and run. In the process, Revis inter-
cepted two passes and returned one for 100
yards for a go-ahead touchdown in the ﬁrst

quarter.

With the Jets offense struggling, Revis’
play had potential to be key in their goal of a
playoff run. Revis also had three tackles and
four defended passes. Marshall was targeted
13 times by backup quarterback Matt Moore,
with six receptions for 109 yards. His longest
reception of 46 yards occurred when Marshall
was matched up withjets cornerback Antonio
Cromartie.

In a must—win game between the Philadel-
phia Eagles and Washington Redskins, Lesean
McCoy (PittRB, 2007-2008) might have saved

the Eagles’ season, as well as his coach Andy
Reid, in a 20-13 victory. With the Eagles coming
off a streak of four losses, McCoy turned into
the Eagles’ workhorse by rushing the ball 28
times for 126 yards and one touchdown.

The Eagles are going into a bye week with
a 2-4 record, and the rushing threat of McCoy
could make or break the season, as well as take
pressure of Michael Vick and the injury-prone
offensive line. ~

In the same game, McCoy’s teammate
Dion Lewis (Pitt running back, 2009-2010)
rushed twice for 10 yards. At the end of the ﬁrst
quarter, it appeared that Lewis had scored his
ﬁrst career touchdown before a booth review

overturned the call placing the ball inside the I

1-yard line. McCoy ended up running the ball in
two plays later to put the Eagles ahead 14-0.
With Lewis making a goal-line appearance
in a tight game, it appears that he might have
passed Ronnie Brown on the depth chart. Lew-
is again lined up as the Eagles kick returner,
but every Redskin kickoff was downed for a
touchback. °
Jabaal Sheard (Pitt defensive lineman,
2007-2010) put together another strong game
for the Cleveland Browns despite a team loss
to the Oakland Raiders. Sheard recorded four
solo tackles and one sack for the Browns.
Elsewhere in the NFL, the Buffalo Bills,
with assistant coach Dave Waniistedt (Pitt
offensive tackle, 1971-1973, and head coach,
2005-2010), fell to the New York Giants 27-24.

were downed inside the 20-yard line to pin

one tackle and one defended pass in the loss.
Berry is still working his way back from a

season. 8
