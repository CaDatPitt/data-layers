Tap Day. originally a function
of the Student Government..was
sponsored by Mortar Board and

Omicron Delta Kappa (ODK) last ‘

year. Because both organizations
decided not to sponsor Tap Day
this year." the festivity will not be
held.

President of ODK Gary Shaffer
said a lack of student interest
was responsible for cancellation
of Tap Day.

“We're hoping that honoraries
or the Student Association will
take up Tap Day next year." said
Shaffer. He said he felt that Tap
Day will probably not be contin-
ued unless “students express a
needforit.“ I

S CONTROVERSIAL
Tap Day has been controversial
for at least two years.

In March of 1969. Dr. James
Holland of the Psychology De-
partment criticized Tap Day at
the ceremony itself.

“Tap Day is a model of corpor-
ate liberalism in America,” Hol-
land argued in a prepared speech.
“Selection into this quasi-elite
group is similar to that of co-op-
tation in the power elite itself. The
process reinforces the patterns of
behavior or thought condoned by
the power elite.”

Holland further contended that‘

radical campus leaders are not
likely to be tapped nor are long-
haired or black students.

Citing the skilled leadership of

, the Black Action Society as proof

blacks are worthy of recognition.
Holland claimed that the attitudes
and politics of blacks fall outside
the bounds acceptable to the hon-
oraries.

“The honoraries contribute as
well to society’s subjugation of an-
other group—women,” said Hol-
land. “Females are relegated to
a separate set of honoraries which
reinforce the pattern of male su-
premacy and exploitation of the
female.”

Holland suggested that "we

must turn to other life styles-life
styles that reject vicious compe-

  

tituion in favor of creating a broth-
erhood of man."
RECOGNITION AND
COMMUNICATION

Shaffer agrees that honoraries
are elitist. but says that they do
serve a two-fold purpose. The hon-
oraries. he said. serve as a recog-
nition and as a means of commun-
ication which Shaffer feels is
“sorely needed."

Shaffer added that the times
are changing. "The honoraries
haven‘t caught up with them yet."
said Shaffer. “But after all. Pitt
is a conservative school.“

Marcia Haley, assistant direc-
tor of Student Activities feels that
“Tap Day should recognize stu-

~ dents only if they want to be rec-

ognized.”
Haley stated that each honorary

has decided to honor its own. She

said she feels that a personalized
recognition is better.

- Offering »a reason for the stu-
dents‘ disinterest in Tap Day.
Haley remarked. “It appears that
students aren‘t as concerned with
superficial glory as before.“

There will not be an Owl Hall-
of-Fame this year either. Shaffer
stated that it was dropped because
“the method by which people were
picked was considered shaky, ar-
bitrary and unfair.”

WPGH Broadcasts As
Blacks, Whites

by EVAN PATTAK
Associate Editor

The charged atmosphere at
campus radio_station WPGH was
eased somewhat Monday night
when black and white staff mem-
bers resolved at least some of
their differences.

That meeting ended a hectic day

‘for WPGH personnel that includ-

ed the reopening of the station fol-
lowing a weekend of silence. the
discovery that its administrative
offices has been ransacked. dis-
cussion in Bernard Kobosky‘s of-
fice that ended in a heated shout-
ing match. and the resignation of
station General Manager Ed Rose
at that meeting.

Rose. who closed the station
Friday night to minimize danger
to staff and equipment. came back
on the air at noon Monday. At that
time it was discovered that the
administrative offices of WPGH
had been vandalized over the
weekend.

EXPLOSION SIMMERING

At Monday nights meeting.
most of the issues that split the
station along racial lines were dis-
cussed. Apparently. the explosion
of Friday evening had been sim-
mering at the station for about
18 months.

It was a year and a half ago that
Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs
Bernard Kobosky agreed to es-
tablish the “Black Side." a sec-
tion of WPGH programming de-
signed for the tastes of blacks on
campus.

Members of the Black Side
charged that, since that time,
they as blacks have been treated
unfairly. They alleged that whites
were given freer access to the
station and its equipment and that
tests administered to staff mem-
bers to prove competence arbi-
trary and made easier for whites.

Black Side members also de-
nounced whatthey termed the "ra-
cism" of certain WPGH person-
nel.

At the meeting Monday night.
the 12 staff members present

hammered out of the following
agreements:

——The general manager of the sta-
tion will have a master key and
access to all rooms:

—Certa‘in personnel may obtain
keys at all times at the Student
Union desk. and

—All tests administered to WPGH
staff would be written and stan-
dardized.

The future of the Black Side at
the station and the attitudinal
problems of the black-white
schism were left unresolved. Act-
ing General Manager Bill-Brunet-
ti said that the discussions were
"fruitful.“ but both he and Black
Side apokesmen agreed that no
further discussions w:,uld be
scheduled in the immediate future.

CONGRESSWOMAN Shirley
Chisholm, scheduled to speak
here Thursday as part of the
March Women's Speakers Se-
ries, has cancelled her engage-
ment. She must attend a meet-
ing of black legislators called
by President Nixon for Thurs-
day. S I

Rose went on the air at noon.

decision to reopen. . ~

exchanged words with Rose. “E,v- j I,

Federal Judge Dismisses
Pgh. 5 Case, Appeal Slated

by MIKE SIMON
Night Editor

The case of the Pittsburgh Five.
charging the Pittsburgh police
with excessive brutality and har-
assment at various protests. has
been dismissed by U.S. District
Judge Joseph F. Weis, Jr.

Burton L. Aschiem. Jr.. Ken-
neth P. Boas. Mark Cohen. Robert

' L. Ruck and Thomas W. Simonds.

the “Five” attempted unsuccess-
fully. to establish that a "chill fac-
tor" had been instituted by the po-
lice. thus inhibiting people from
participating in demonstrations
for fear of imprisonment or bodi-
ly harm.

Weis said that he had allowed
the protestors a "wide latitude“
in their testimony. He said he

failed. however.‘ to see any type
of plot against “long-hairs“ or any
"bad faith usage of state legal
pwoer" throughout the prosecu-
tion.

The Judge said that at times
“excessive force” had been used
by the police and stated that it
was “quite disturbing.” He then
suggested that the complaints of
the Five should have been cleared
up on a local level.

Robert Ruck. a member of the
“Five." felt that the defeat in
court was not really a defeat. “It
may have aided our purpose."
said Ruck. “to show that justice
really doesn’t exist in a social
vacuum. How could we have re-
ceived a fair trail when the courts
have become so politicized that

blacks. long-hairs, or any other
minority group cannot receive a
fair trial."

He maintained that all the peo-
ple attending the evidentiary
hearings got a first hand chance
to see corruption of the political
system. and expressed the hope
that this would publicize their
plight. .-

“Right now,” Ruck declared,
“the flak is heavy on anti-war or-
ganizers, as the numbers of con-
spiracy trials around the country
would indicate. However, this will
not deter our participation inthe
movement, as the upcoming
spring offensive will indicate.”

The spring offensive is a se-
cries of demonstrations planned

to “raise the consciousness” of

the country to assure participa- 4

tion in the massive civil disobedi-
ence May Day action in Washing-
ton, D. C., beginning May 2.

The “Five” still face counter
charges filed by the police, con-
sisting of assault and battery and

*5?

inciting to riot in connection with I

a disturbance in Magistrate’s
Court involving police and anti-
war protestors last March.

A spokesman for the “Five”
said that they “will definitely ap-
peal the Judge’s decision. We have
much better things to do than deal
with the criminal charges facing
us. It is much more important for
us to organize for the May action.

  (ﬂiariots Race on Bigelow

"Shades of Ben tHur”

by MARLENE ZNOY

“The Greatest Show on Earth,”
Greek Week, 1971, began with
the traditional noon chariot race
Monday.

A carnival atmosphere prevail-
ed complete with cotton candy and
Calliopes, balloons and caged
animals.

Streamers hung from trees
along Bigelow Blvd. and acrobats
tumbled on atrampoline on the
lawn of the Cathedral.

Greeks sold pistachio nuts for
Children’s Hospital and peddled
cotton candy for the crippled chil-
dren’s drive. . -

Many onlookers saw the chariot
race for the first time.-

Four'— year — old Beth Claxton
wide-eyed and smiling, viewed the
scene with a balloon in hand.

And a visitor from the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin commented wry-
ly, “It reminds me of an Italian
gladiator flick——that didn’t make
it.” A

“It beats the bed races at Ohio
State,” confessed a transfer stu-
dent from OSU. She explained that
Ohio State students top go-carts

‘ with mattresses for racing.

A reporter for a local newspa-
per was nostalgic. “Last year the
kids were rioting. This shows that
they .aren’t a lot different than we
were 30 years ago.”

The fate of the bill sponsored
by President Nixon, according to
Attorney Robert A. Seewald, will
probably be decided in May or
June. Seewald handles cases re-

A June Weekend. distinct from
the orientation session of late Au-
gust, has been planned. During the
weekend,
commuters and Allegheny County
dorm residents can live on cam-
pus from Friday, June 18, to
Sunday, the 20th.

This will be the commuters‘
only opportunity to experience
life in the campus dorms, since
the session in late August will be
restricted to new dorm residents
not from Allegheny County.

The June Weekend will feature
coed-housing, with alternate
male-female houses in the Tow-
ers. No curfew restrictions will
be enforced.

Following group advisor meet-
ings and placement tests during
the day, movies and dances will
provide evening entertainment. A

bill would eliminate the retroac-
tive clause and affect only pros-
pective students.

The LS-C -deferment is tem-

have not succeeded in completing

25 per cent of their required_

courses of the preceeding year.
The deferments are revoked if the

Yale Offers Delayed Tuition

NEW HAVEN, Conn. —— (IP) —
Yale’s newly-adopted Tuition
Postponement Plan marks the
first time that any college or uni-
versity has attempted such major
changes in the traditional pattern
of tuition payment.

The unique feature of the plan
is that each individual’s obligati-on
rises and falls with his income
after graduation rather than be-
ing fixed indebtedness. Although
the rate is the same for every-
body. since it is keyed to adjusted
gross income, those who earn
more _will pay more than their
classmates in lower earningjobs.

The charge is computed as four-
tenths of one per cent of annual
adjusted gross income for each
$1,000 postponed. It is estimated
at current interest rates that stu-
dents would discharge their obli-
gation in about 26 years.

If, however, the average earn-

ings of the group turned out to be A

lower than projected, or if Yale’s
cost of borrowing were greater
than expected, then it might take
longer for the group to discharge
the obligation. The outside limit

of the repayment obligation in any
case would be 35 years. V "

Even after his obligation has be-
gun, a participant may elect to
terminate his contract by making
a payment that brings his total
payments to one and one-half
times the tuition he postponed,
plus an interest rate to cover
Yale’s administrative and bor-
rowing costs.

Also, any student may convert
the long term charge against
earnings into an immediate fixed
obligation at any time up to six
months before graduation. .

The postponed obligation of a
student who marries will be com-
puted on the basis of his or her
separate income, or one-half of
the joint income, whichever is
higher. For example, a housewife
with no separate earnings will
compute her obligation on the bas-
is of one-half of the joint income.

President Kingman Brewster.

Jr.. emphasized that “the tuition '

postponement option is frankly

experimental. The effort is to find’

out what the problems and possi-
bilities of such a device are."

°Chess Rollin’ Along’

Wednesday. March 24,1971—THE PITT NEWS—Page 3

Chess Team Champ

by ELLEN GANLEY
Night Editor

The Pitt chess team is check-
mating its way to first place in
the Pittsburgh Industrial Chess
League. a

Last Sunday, the team jumped
from third to first place in the
league via a 31/2 to 1/2 win over
U. S. Steel. Members of the Pitt
contingent who participated in the
match were Bill Hughes on the
No. 1 board, Bill Dempler on the
second, Dr. Herbert Barry on
board No. 3. and Larry Ingram on
the fourth board. Three wins and
one draw were registered.

There are 14 teams in the In-
dustrial Chess League. These in-
clude teams from industrial cor-
porations. universities, prisons.
and even a family participating as
a team.

The present league standing
show the Pitt team on top of an
extremely close race with 20‘/2
points out of a possible 28. The
Carnegie-Mellon first team is in
second with 20, the Guild has
19‘/2 for third, Bettis Ard. has 19,
and the Walled Knights are in fifth
place with 18 points. Because of
the closeness of the first five
teams, the results of the last three
matches of the year will be cru-

cial in deciding who is league

champion.

The chess team also traveled to
Northwestern University, in
Evanston. 111.. for the North
American intercollegiate Chess
Championships earlier this year.
Although the group was seeded
27th in the tourney. they finished
the championships. placing 17th.
The individual records for the Pitt
team were Lenny Rabinowitz. 5-3;
Bill Dempsey who ended with a
4-4 record: Bill Hughes who fin-
ished 4-4, and Larry Ingram who
finished with the team high of 612-

11/2.

Fifty-one teams participated in

‘ the intercollegiate championships.

Some of the teams that Pitt com-
peted against were Wayne State,
Clarkson U., University of Mich-
igan, which finished fifth; North-
western, and the University of
Wisconsin, Madison campus.

An interesting twist was added
to the tournament when one of
the Northwestern teams (they
had eight teams competing),en-
tered a computer in the competi-
tion. The computer, however, fin-
ished with the lowest score of the
three man-one machine team,
with a score of 2-6.

Recently, the Pitt team entered
a bid to have the 1971 Intercollegi-
ate Championships in Pittsburgh.
They were underbid by a mere
$200, by the University of Toronto.

Matches in the Industrial Chess
League are played on the third
Sunday of each month. The next
match for the Pitt team will be on

April 18 against the fourth place
team, Bettis Ard., a group from
the Westinghouse Corporation.
The May match is going to be held
at Pitt and will be with the Kings
and Queens.

‘Ten years ago, the Pitt chess
team was first in the state. Four
years ago, they won the Indus-
trial Championship, and they may
win it again this year. V

But next year will be a different
story. There are presently only 11
members in the Pitt Chess Club,
of which the team is a part. Four

seniors are graduating and one of

the members from the faculty is
leaving.

Weekly meetings of the club are
held Wednesday nights from 6 to
10 p.m. in room 119, Student Un-
ion. Anyone who is interested is
urged to attend and participate in
the inter-club matches.

Housing Available

The housing office has initiated
a program of short term rental
housing for the Spring and Sum-
mer sessions.

Any student enrolled in the Uni-
versity duringlthat time period
will have the option of renting a
single room, or, if two students
apply together, a double room.

There is no advance notice due
in applying, but it is to the stu-
dents advantage to give a days
notice so the room can be pre-
pared and supplied with sheets
and towels.

JOHN Strand and Jim Kearn-
ey, sophomore members of the
William Pitt Debate Union,
finished with an ll-5 record.
in a recent district tournament.
They are now qualified for the
National Debate Tournament
which will take place at Mac-
alaster College.

 . Tempering Tapping

Without a whimper, Tap Day has died.

No somber eulogy should mark its passing. In fact, it is tempt-
ing to join in a revelrous wake.

Tap Day, an old though controversial institution, owed its lon-
gevity to the popularity of the “carrot-stick” tradition. Reward stu-

' dents for learning, the sages said, and they will excel.

Unfortunately, the primitive incentive principle on which Tap

’ Day was based has not died with its offspring.

While Tap Day can merely haunt us now, its companions -

" honoraries and March awards -_ still remain.

The Pitt News cannot condemn the perpetuation of honoraries.
assuming inequities in selection methods are curtailed.

V So long as they do not purport to house the “cream of the crop,”
honoraries are guilty merely of elitism - not arrogant elitism. Per-

‘ * _ haps there's a difference.

Also, unlike awards, they serve a practical purpose - communica-

» {H tion—by bringing “student leaders” and scholars together.
"Moreover, two honoraries, Druids and Cwens, have taken"

  

~ . stride this year to make honoraries more functional.

 

The two groups will shortly be conducting a personal contact
campaign with state legislators, to make them aware of the Uni-
versity’s fiscal problems.

— Such efforts to bridge a conspicuous gap are commendable.

Unlike honoraries, however, awards like the Omicron Delta

‘iiKappa Man of the Year and the Thyrsa Amos Award serve no

. communal purpose.

These awards are presumptious and superfluous.
No one person can be considered representative of a class.

Indeed, the heterogeneity of a student body is a measure of
its strength. .

Backers of the tradition in each honorary say they don‘t claim

‘the individual selected is the best of a class. By honoring one

person, they argue, they honor the class.
Why not honor the entire class, then, instead of bedecking

I _ individuals with laurels?

The selections process for special awardees is simply too sub-

’ _jective and unfair to be continued.

True, the tapping practices of Druids, ODK, and the other

' honoraries are also inequitable.

A personal friend of an ODK member, for example, stands a

~much better chance of being tapped than someone whose objec-

.- — tive qualifications for membership are similar.

Tapping revisions must be made. In the meantime, at least

 : tappees are selected by their peers.

In contrast, the ODK Man of the Year is chosen by six people -

' two faculty members, two administrators, and two recent alumni -
a whose contacts with those they judge are often casual and second-

hand.

According to ODK President Gary Shaffer, the Owl Hall of
Fame and its adjuncts. Mr. and Miss Pitt. were abolished because
the “method by which people were picked was considered shaky.

‘ arbitrary, and unfair.“

_ which are at best vestiges of an ebbing educational philosoph

  

Q Who can deny that Shaffer's description fits the other awards
too?

The Pitt News urges honoraries to revise admissions standards
to attract a wider variety of outstanding students.

The Pitt News also suggests that honoraries eliminate awards

It is my belief that the stu-
dents of this University in great
numbers are knowingly con-
tributing and conspiring for the
overthrow of this nation. I shall
review that fact although this
even seems passe’.

First, they have enrolled in
and are blindly supporting (with
money even) an institution which
subtly uses force to blur the
joys and hopes of persons.
This force is manifested mostly
in rigid course structure, im-
personal professors (or those who
will only be personal “to a de-
gree"), and a docile herd of
sheepish undergraduates who
accept what is tantamount to
their own personal destruction.

This is ironic for the same
scream excessively about revolu-
tion and the killing of men in
war, yet they sit uncreatively
idle by the same traits that de-
personalize unto death.

Secondly, they daily engage
in riots to this end. What great-
er impersonal disorderly tumult
is there than the “normal” me-
anderings of this University.
How many people want to go to
what they are goint to? What is
the level of human freedom in-
volved in choosing a wide array
of impressive bodies of know-
ledge?

Knowledge is not by its very
nature personal and what is im-

manity. Your crime is sin.

Thirdly, they knowingly pass-
ively sit and contemplate (even
listen to) outpourings of infor-
mation without taking time to
consider if it means anything
to them as persons.

Many things are classic.
noble, should be read and heard
by everyone, but anything is
not good for anybody at any-
time. The majority of the stu-
dents are well-used to fitting
into meaningless structures
which demand that their feel-
ings never fully be expressed
and that others be likewise
silenced or avoided.

The person-toperson encount-
er, the I-Thou relations is out of
class material. Does this sound
like a group of human beings work-
ing out their personal fulfillment
or" does it sound like large-scale
repression of personal dignity?

Fourthly, they worship - for
what other reason would large
masses engage in stupidity -
continually getting together and
torturing and teasing each other
in this oppressive context, daily,
five and six times a day, in
little slots here and there. run-
ning from slot to slot.

Endless time is spent interro-
gating each other about these
torture sessions in the hope
that comparison will at least

/l4i/idles’; Klassroo/ii"   Opirréssiuti K175,

I could go on but my point
is clear. Oppression is a daily
choice, a daily conspiracy, a

.planned schedule for most of

the students of this University.

Will you take the responsi-
bility for giving most of your
time to mental masturbation and
creative giving-up (which is what
I am doing now)? Will you take
the responsibility for your daily
choice of oppression with no
attempt to change your own
heart and thus try to influence
the hearts of others?

Will you take the responsibil-
ity for allowing people to op-
press you. for oppressing others,
for participating in structures
which doynot allow persons to
be what they are at the moment
and make it unsafe for them to
reveal their own feelings? Will
you take the responsibility for
the engineered conditioned sense
of hopelessness and alienation
this engenders?

And will you then take the
responsibility to become a pro-
duct of this yourself and live
and work with others who never
made it to a courage to be and
create?

If you do, fine, but in my
estimation your choice to con-
tinue here as you are is an in-
vestment in deadness and all
forms of social and political
repression, and it must be

heavy laddén with illusion. The
falseness in you may yet be-

._ sidered. ’ -

by JERRY WEBSTER
Staff Columnist

Every day hundreds of kids are being
turned off by society's biggest consumer

factories—our public schools.

They turn the joy of learning and living
into a nightmare for some. and forced la-
bor for most. Theier concern isn't for the
psychological and social growth of chil-
dren. but rather in hard. cold facts (which
they probably invented. anyway).

Everyone seems to be interested in that
mystery person. “the good teacher.“ The
best teacher today is the one who can throw
off the yoke of curriculum. fact learning.
and acheivement test performance and
work with small human beings to help them

develop into warm. creative. mature adults.

How exactly do we get thisistrange hy-
brid? Not from teacher training colleges,

. to be sure. Most state teachers colleges

are still hung up somewhere between De-
wey (a very good man, to be sure) and Dick
and Jane (who can do no bad).

It takes determination to become a
good teacher—most likely it will take a
couple years of hard knocks-—and then only
if the school board. PTA, etc., haven‘t al-
ready absconded with your mind and put
in a more efficient Westinghouse unit.

Pitt is probably the largest teacher-
training institute in Western Pennsylvania.
Approximately 300 students will graduate
and be certified this spring from Elemen-
tary Ed., which means approximately 10.-
000 children in grades K-6 will be exposed
to new Pitt graduates next fall.

Where exactly is the department head-
ed? To find out, I sat down with Dr. Horton
Southworth, chairman, and Dr. Nick Defi-
gio, lecturer, and we discussed the direc-
tion the department was taking.

Elementary Ed is committed to closing
the gap between reality and ideals for stu-
dents. It isn‘t infrequent for idealistic
young teachers to wash up in the first year
because they weren‘t prepared to cope with
problems in and out of the classroom.

' ,.._.---._....' ../' '.'

Not that idealism is bad—without it
society would stagnate. It is. however.
necessary for teachers interested in re-
forms to have the interpersonal skills and
political finesse necessary to realize their
ideals.

The only way to close the gap is to get
students out into schools as much as pos-
sible. In the Fall, 1971, El. Ed. will have
15 “clinical schools” where students will
have pre-student teaching experience in a
number of ways.

They not only offer future teachers val-
uable experience but also give students a
chance to decide whether teaching is their
bag before they get in too deep to get out.

Hopefully. in the future underclassmen
will be offered school experience before
they apply to the School of Education.

Getting into the schools means, as Dr.
Southworth‘ put it, developing “a partner-
ship . . . trust between the University and
the public schools.” Knowing my own in-
terest in education reform, both Dr. South-
worth and Dr. Defigio stressed the impor-
tance of “operating quietly”—they don't
want to jeopardize the relationships they
have been working to cultivate.

10,000 children in kindergarten

through sixth grade will be

exposed to new Pitt teachers

in the fall.

 

The department only stays in schools
where they feel they‘re welcome. In the
past they have left schools quietly where
there were problems and teachers they
couldn‘t deal with. Some school districts
are paying University people as clinical
staff to help improve their programs.

Pitt seems to be really influencing

~Wédnesday.‘March 24;1971—'riiE pm NEWS—Page5 ’ 9

teachers who are already practicing. In-
creasingly more co-operating teachers
are using the three credits offered to them
for participating in the student teacher
program.

Dr. Southworth noted that many prac-
ticing teachers “cannot get a handle on
what they want to do” and that exposure to
Pitt student teachers can help teachers re-
evaluate themselves and move in new
directions.

Dr. Southworth avoided making any
kind of statements about the future of the
Open Classroom at Pitt. because it dealt
with other departments.

From our conference and talking to
other faculty members, I feel safe in say-
ing it looks good for the Open Classroom.
The direction of A Model of Teacher Train-
ing, a study written by Dr. Southworth for

HEW. is definitely away from the tradi—‘

tional classroom and toward personalized
instruction.

Although the Open Classroom is personal
and subject integration-oriented rather
than structured and fact-oriented as in-
dividualized instruction, the philosophies
are very compatable. Some of the mem-
bers of the El. Ed. faculty are already mov-
ing in the direction of the Open Classroom.

El. Ed. is committed to developing
community ties and offering valuable pre-
teaching experience rather than commit-
ted to certain ideologies. They don't care
whether a student can prepare a lesson
plan, cram students for achievement tests.
or whether he or she prays three times a
day to Summerhill.

Their basic criterion for a good teach-
er is how well he or she acts with the
child.

It’s still up to the students to decide in
what direction their education will take
them.

The word of the hour. whether you’re in
Education or CAS is Take Your Education '
into Your Own Hands. Confront your in-

structors with your problems and needs—— ‘

whether they are for more exposure to the
Open Classroom, or for a better means of
evaluation.

The worst—they say no—but you still
have the options of dropping the class or go-,‘
ing to someone higher up who may be more
sympathetic. It’s possible to shape your
own education if you take the bull by th
horns. '

Elementary education is moving toward

humanism and child-centeredness. Exactly .

what direction they will move seems. up
for grabs, yet it seems by offering experi- _

ence, the department is letting students _. 

find their own directions.

It's up to the students to discover them-
selves and other human beings and to go to

schools with a life-loving rather than life-' ‘

hating attitude. We can tear away the
shackles of consumerism and move for-
ward. to a new humanism.

“Heroism” ~/resented

Editor, The Pitt ‘News:

' I read with much interest but
little amusement the article in the
March 19 issue, entitled “Hero-
ism in the Cafeteria,” by Beryl S.
Handler and Jeffrey D. Lehman.
As a SAGA employee I bitterly re-
sent this cheap attempt at humor
and as a Pitt student I resent that
the Pitt News would resort to
such a low level of journalism.

I fail to understand why the
young man in the story is des-
cribed as a hero for throwing a
glass of red juice on the floor of
the cafeteria at 6:45, supposed-
lily in the face of great SAGA har-
assment. The fact is, the place is
in a mess at that time with trays
all over the place and debris on

. the floor.

If the “hero” was being inter-
rupted in his meal he is one of the
few in that situation at 6:45 —
nearly everyone still in the cafe-
teria at that time is just sitting

‘around talking. '

. I am disappointed that the Pitt
News would run such a story be-
cause it gives an unfair picture
of the situation in the cafeteria as
well as publicity to a student for
giving in to an urge that most of
us ‘have managed to suppress
somewhere around the age of

I I eight.

Circle  Curious on Dance Reaction

Editor, The Pitt News:

On Friday, Circle K will have a
dance in the SU Ballroom from 8
p.m. to midnight. It is for the
sole purpose of raising money;
many organizations do the same
thing all the time

Ours was to have a twist: a
mini-skirt dance, where skirts
were measured and the shortest
one would win its wearer a prize.
Everyone, ‘including the girls in
our club, thought it was a good
idea.

Since advertising began, we
have had several females in our
office who were, to understate it,
upset. ‘

Circle K has no desire to insult
or offend any group. However, it
also wishes to avoid alignment
with a minority group that seeks

to infringe on the majoritys
rights. i.e.. their desire to parti-
cipate in a dance contest of this
kind.

We have no way of knowing
whether our posters have been
written on and ripped down by 200
enraged students or by seven
hard—core radicals.

Circle K will have a dance Fri-
day evening. Whether it will in-

clude a mini-skirt contest or not
‘remains to seen.’ ’

If the dance is held as a mini-
skirt dance, it will be open to
males. By the way, the dance was
always open for males.

We openly invite anyone who
would like to comment on the sub-

ject to call us at ext. 7349 or come

University urging for the com-

I, as have many, many of my

Merritt congratulated For Fullﬁlling     
Promises to Improve Campus Security

Editor. The Pitt News:

Last August, at a meeting with members of the University Housing
staff, Superintendent of Campus Police Robert Merritt made quite a
few promises—most of which he hoped to fulfill by the end of the fall

term.

Certainly more courageous than most University administrators.
Mr. Merritt has made good on all his promises-—a most remarkable

achievement.

First he increased the size of his force from approximately 65 to

85 officers.

Secondly, he put beat patrolmen all over the campus. And more im-
portantly he has assigned four officers almost every weekend night to
patrol the Towers, Quadrangle, and Student Union area, in an all-out
attempt to reduce and prevent robberies or general assaults.

Thirdly, Superintendent Merritt has obtained new vehicles for the
police department, so that during the day one car can stick to patrol-
ling the campus while the other car may focus its attention to illegally
parked cars. At night one car patrols the campus while a second or
third is used to check University buildings.

Finally the announcement of the institution of the very capable
Walt Walters as the dorm sergeant was made in early September. With
this new position Sgt. Waters is now able to correlate and dispense all
pertinent information to the men working in his area.

In addition to this, the superintendent has also added to his depart-
ment a detective division—with Claude Glenn as chief inspector and
Charles Brevard as the assistant inspector. *

In conclusion, I believe that congratulations are certainly in order
for Superintendent Merritt and dedicated group of men and women
working for him——and working for us, the students of the University of

Pittsburgh.

Arts and Sciences at this Univer-
sity~and I was on the threshold of
decisions that would determine
my career. But my life—my in-
tellectual, emotional, and spirit-
ual life—had become so unman-

. ageable that I was incapable of

making any decision on any sub-
ject.

When I first met with Dr. Hill,
I was unaware of the fact that he
was a vocational counselor. What
I needed was simply a mature
person to talk to4someone who
would be interested in the whole
person Kenith Levicoff, not the
fragmented student, daughter, sex
object that I had become.

I will not describe the process
of development that I have experi-
enced with Dr. Hill‘s help. He
could certainly describe that bet-
ter than I could. But I can de-
scribe myself——I am a happier,

more mature person than I

' thought I had the capacity to be.

Moreover, I have made voca-
tional decisions: I am a graduate
student in the Department of Eng-
lish. I am headed toward a career
in teaching. I have made these de-
cisions based on honest informa-
tion about myself — information
about what it takes to satisfy my
creative urges.

I cannot give all the credit for
my growth to Dr. Hill. I did most,
if not all, of the work -myself.
What Dr. Hill did was to provide
an atmosphere, a context in which
I could do the work.

What he did was to show me
that he cared.

Dr. Hill has been replaced as
director of the University Coun-
seling Center. He is still able to
carry on his work in the center,
sovhis replacement is less than
tragic. But he has been robbed by .
the administration of the praise
that he deserves for the crucially
important work that he is doing.

I realize that my outrage at Dr.

~ Hill’s replacement will not change

the decision of the administration.
But he deserves at least my sup-
port and my thanks for being . . .0

“Under l\/lilkwood”--A Poetic Drama

Theatre Stages Llaregyp Happenings

by CHARLES LEVINE
Drama Staff

The preface of Dylan Thomas‘ Under Milk Wood
describes it as a “turn from the strictly personal
kind of poetry to a more public form of expression

. where there would be scope for all his versatil-
ity. for his gifts of humor and characterization. as
well as his genius for poetry."

Thomas’ success in combining those divergent
qualities creates a drama which is totally fascinat-
ing and at the same time extremely complex. The
Studio Theatre’s current production of Under Milk
Wood catches well the mood of a drama which is
neither banal nor overly poetic.

Under Milk Wood is the rendering of the life of a
small Welsh town by the sea, from the middle of one
night to the middle of the next. The happenings in
one day in “Llaregyp” are recounted by a kind of
“dramatized" gossip. The main “action" consists
of episodes:

Captain cat dreams of his drowned mates and re-
calls his happiness with Rosy Probert, whom he
shared with a donkeyman.

Miss Price, dressmaker, has an erotic dream of
Mr. Edwards, who is courting her.

John Black, the cobbler, dreams of driving sin
from the town.

Evens, undertaker, dreams of his childhood,
stealing buns.

Mr. Waldo dreams of his mother, dead wife, mis-
tress, and other sins, and in the end, is having in-
tercourse with Polly Garter, drunk.

Mrs. Ogmore-Prichard dreams of her two dead
husbands, whom it is suggested, she has killed.

And so life goes on in Llaregyp. The seeming sim-
plicity is undercut by many factors, most important
of which is the language.

This drama was originally described as a “play
for voices” and was designed for radio production.
The mood was thus designed to be created by two
narrators, in this production, Bob Concilus and Ka-
thy Devecka. The difficulty of their task is great,

as Thomas in creating the roles of the “first and -

second voices” lapsed heavily into his poetic style.
First voice (Bob Concilus) near the, beginning re-
cites,
“The hunched, couters and rabbits wood limping invisible down
to the sloeback, slow black, crowblack, fishingboat bobbing sea.”
Combined with a Welsh accent, the audience’s
task of understanding becomes that much harder,

SHERRY CALDWELL, Kenneth Neal and Rich Johnston in a scene from Un- time Shifts and gave the audience ‘needed Clues as A

der Milk Wood.

despite an effective but overly mundane interpre-
tation by Concilus.

The complexity increases as it is realized that the
47 cast parts were played by eight actors. The cast-
ing was done well and all, it seems, added some-
thing personal to their parts:

Cal Killeen was best at capturing the difficult

poetic verse of “Rev. Eli Jenkins.“ Rich Jonston
was hilarious as "Willy Nilly." Sherry Caldwell
was most effective in producing contrasting char-
acters. as she was adorable as Gwenny and con-
vincingly cold as Mrs. Dai Bread.

Stephanie Fitzgerald as Mrs. Ogmore—Prichard
was obviously a woman who could kill two husbands
hygenically. Marilyn Potkins as the whore. Rosy
Prubert. was outstanding. and her musical score
added to the gay atmosphere.

The action is most effective where Thomas touch-
es directly the lives of his town and its people.
There is a sudden sharpening and deepening, very
different in effect from the almost pretentious nar-
rator. The actual voices are very different from the
atmospheric voices of the observers:

Voice l—-And look at Ocky Milkman’s wife.

2—He keeps her in the cuppard with the empties.

3—And think of Dai Bread with two wives.

2--—One for the daytime and one for night.

4—Men are brutes on the quiet.

- By weaving a pattern of voices rather thanan
ordinary conversational sequence. the reach of the
drama is significantly enlarged. It can include not
only things said but things left unsaid such as the
images of memory and dream, the contrast of vari-
ous voices.

The directing of Richard Jakiel is superb in
creating these powerful contrasts. The characters
interact well and in most cases the shift from one
level of dialogue to another is clear and as smooth
as the play itself permits.

The language of dream, of song, of unexpressed
feeling, is the primary experience. The people in
the end, hardly talk to each other; each is locked in
his own dream, or a convention of public morals.

It is in the expression of this atmosphere that
Jakiel‘s work is finest. The audience is drawn into

say the least, fun.

Also meriting mentionis the lighting work of
Mitchell Moxley which simulated well the intended

to where they should be looking on a stage over-
flowing with numerous conversations.

. Editor's Note: Following are
excerpts from a speech deliver-
ed by Dr. James Holland, Pro-
lessor of psychology, at Tap Day
ceremonies March 5, 1969.

You are gathered here tonight
because you have been selected
/as student leaders in our Uni-
versity. For representatives of
the student body elite it should
be instructive to examine the
nature of the elite leadership in
our society as a whole; what it
is; and how it is imitated in
college honoraries; and how
the objectives of society’s elite
are serviced by the honoraries
specifically and the University
generally.

A recent analysis by a social
psychologist, William Domhoff,
makes it clear that America is
ruled by a smaller upper class
which is, in effect, a govern-
ing class.

Domhoff demonstrates that the
upper class forms a closely inter-
twined social class communi-
cating through clubs, social con-
tact and, extensive interlocking
membership of governing boards
of industries, banks, universities
and foundations. They form a
tight grouping of people sharing

similar views, similar values
and politics.
CORPORATE CONTROL -

This largely hereditary aristo-
cracy rules first through its con-

 

  Holland Raps

 

trol of the corporate economy.
Because they own some 3/4 of
corporate stock, they name the
boards of directors which in fact
usually include a majority of
upper class members.

The non-upper class members
are almost always corporate exe-
cutives, corporation lawyers or
college presidents, most of whom
went to the same upper class
schools and who were chosen be-
cause they share upper class
views and values.

COMPETITIVENESS STRESSED
Most relevant to us tonight is

the machinery for developing .

the system’s supporting person-
nel. In the upper levels of the
middle class we are taught a
set of values conforming to the
system. The better colleges serve
to screen and stratify those who
shall run the corporate and. mili-
tary machinery to make your

way into the junior executive.

group you might best enter a
good collegevpassing culturally
biased screening tests, entering
from the right prep schools and
free from the blemish of civil
rights arrest or the reputation
of troublemaker.

In the University, as in the
rest of society, we learn a vigor-
ous competitiveness which arms
those above us with the means
of controlling and shaping our
behavior. We strive for grades,

 

 

for awards, for entrance into
prestige honor societies, for ad-
mission to prestige social fra-
ternities.

Consider, for a moment, the
role of grades. In the first
place, grades unintentionally
result in passive obedience and
indoctrination. The student,
oriented toward the all—import-
ant grade, permits the teacher
to decide what things are most
important, what data are to be
considered and even, to a degree,
what conclusions are to be
drawn. At test time, the grade
conscious student hands back to
the teacher what is expected.

Second, grading tends to limit
the scope of education in that
it emphasizes what if quantifi-
able. Much that is most valu-
able in education is difficult to
measure objectively. Grading
provides one of several sources
for the impression that all that
is good and worthwhile are
measurable products.

Third, grades instill in us the
tendency for fierce competition.
Grades are usually based on
class rank and good grades are
obtained at the expense of other
students. Fourth, grades serve
the society and the University
administration. The University
turns out a graded product; the
product’s grade depends not
only on talent but also on sub-

, missiveness.

If a student's grades are high
enough he will be eligible for
an honorary. But is he a leader?
At this point additional factors
in support of the eliteist system
come into play. Selection into

this quasi-elite group is similar

to that of co-optation in the
power elite itself. _

Social and political conform-
ity are at a premium. The selec-
tion process tends to be conser-
vative. The process reinforces
the patterns of behavior of
thought condoned by the power
elite. Radical campus leaders
are not likely to be tapped.
There are few beards present to-
night, and few beads, and few
blacks.

As to the absence of black
tapees I am prepared to assume
that black students are not di-
rectly passed over because of
their skin color. However, they
are most decidedly institution-
ally discriminated against. The
Black Action Society has taken
direct and successful action and
therefore on one hand shown
skilled leadership and on the
other hand shown attitudes and
politics outside the bounds ac-
ceptable to the honoraries.

Moreover, our black leaders
arise from a subculture differ-

ent from the dominant culture »

of the people in the honoraries.
In my opinion, many of the
attributes of the black culture
are preferrable to those of the
white middle class culture. But
preferrable or not, the import-
ant thing is that they are differ-
ent, and being different renders
black students unlikely candi-
dates for honoraries even with-
out any racist attitudes influ-
encing the selection.

In summary, the honoraries
follow the samegelitist model as
does society at large. You are
mistaken if you view them asva
step in entering the power elite.

Kuhn (167) and

here will not-be any excuse for

“Both Bobby and Craig are

«still sore," pointed out Assistant

_ Dick Slutzky. “They

“won‘t make any excuses. but

‘they will certainly be at a dis-

Tadvantage ‘because their injur-

ies will restrict their respective

 styles. ’ 

The defending 190 pound na-

“tional champ, Oklahoma State’s

3177 pounds, where he captured

the Big 8 title three weeks ago.

Head Coach Dave Adams is

Jim Banner has spent five
successful years as Pitt’s track
coach. Listening to him talk
about them, they have ‘been
happy and satisfying years. And,
if Banner is to continue making
a living for himself, it seems

he wants to make it in track.

"I consider myself fortunate."
he said, “to be able to work with
the fine young men that I
have now. You have to enjoy

working with the problems of '

the young men as well as coping
with the problems of track it-
self.-

"For me, it‘s a great way of
making a living."

Because track is a year round
sport, Banner gets plenty of op-
portunity to. cope with the prob-
lems of track. Also,‘ because of
the continual contact, he finds
himself closer to the athlete.

Because track is also an indi-
vidual sport. Banner finds it
easier to be more involved than
coaches in other sports.

“If the athlete is dedicated."
he summarized. "there is no
reason to get involved in their
personal lives. Instead. I get into.
their athletic lives.“

Besides being Pitts most suc-
cessful track coach and being one
of the most successful coaches

in Pitt’s history. Banner is one
of the most emotional and vigor—_

ous coaches to be seen anywhere.
His achievements. as track
coach, will verify that he ha_s
indeed _‘made his living’ well.

Wlessel Ends Diving Career In Iowa
ritchAt

T(‘)It/lORROW’S NATIONAL swimming championships will mark the
conclusion "of Dave Wesse|’sV remarkable. diving career at Pitt. He
has set both school and pool records in the one-meter and three-meter

diving events.

 

JIM BANNER ‘ ,
A typical Observation

Taking a “geographically iso-
lated” track school, Jim Banner
has molded the present Pitt
squad into one of the best teams
in the country.

, Pitt is geographically isolated.
he said. "the teams on the East
coast don't want to travel that far
to meet us when there are so
many good other teams closer
to them.

Schools like Ohio State are
involved in the Big Ten and
they aren‘t as eager to meet

us either. As a result we evolv- ’

ed into a big meet schedule."

But, has Banner really made
that much of a difference? ’

Villanova, perhaps the best
track team in the country, re-
cruits its tracksters from all
over the world. Among Banners
present to 25 top athletes, 22
of them are from the Pittsburgh
area. It doesn’t seem feasible
that there is that much track
talent in Western Pennsylvania.
The coaching has made a posi-
tive difference.

Like all coaches, Jim Banner
hates to lose (Who doesn't?) He
wants to win every event that
his athletes enter. But, even if
he doesn‘t win everything, he
is always optimistic towards the
next meet. '

Watching Banner during a
meet, one might wonder who is
more worn out. The coach or
the ‘athlete. He is a picture of
constant motion, always yelling
encouragement, always watch-
ing the action.

At practice, Banner is very
calm. He‘ll put his finger to his
lips. squint his eyes. and see
things others might not even
imagine.

"Al (Benaglio)." he said dur-
ing a practice session. “hold it
(the pole vault) a little bit

higher." Improvement was
seen on the very next jump.

The training technique Ban-
ner has for his athletes is a
simple one. They train on their
own, relying on themseives to
get their practice runs in. Ban-
ner though, is never reluctant to
remind his runners ‘of the im-

. portance of training.

 
  

  Only Pitt
Merman At

Nationals
by JAN FRY ,

Pitt"s top diver David Wessel
is hoping for a “super day“ at
the N.C.A.A. Championships
held tomorrow thru Saturday at
Iowa State University, Ames
Iowa.

“It better be'a super day if
I’m to make the top twelve,“
Wessel remarked. “However, if
worst comes to worst, I’ll get
to see a lot of good diving and
I’ve never been to Iowa, so the
trip will be worth it.”

Wessel is the only member of
the swim squad who qualified
for the Nationals this season
and last. In the one meter board
he scored 274 points (270 are
needed to qualify) and ‘in the
three meter chalked up the re-
quired 290 points.

The Pitt and Trees Pool rec-
ord holder in the one-and three-
meter diving events described
his performance at the Nationals
last year as “poor” (he placed
forty-eighty) and hopes to make
his last try at the competition a
memorable one.

The first year dental student
had qualified for Easterns held
at the University of Pennsyl-
vania two weeks ago, but due
to studies was unable to make
the trip, _

“The coaches were trying to
convince me to go to Easterns
because it would haverhelped
my diving," Wessel explained.
“I could have‘ been swept in
with other top divers and could
have a feel of the tough ‘com-
petition facing me. However,

I just couldn‘t afford the time»

and I really can‘t afford it for
Nationals. But this is my last
try." A

For the last week he has been
practicing at noon and a few
nights a week with diving Coach
Bill Brown. “He’s the greatest
guy in the world,” Wessel
praised. “It’s bad enough he has
to put up with me one night a
week without making special
trips to help me get in shape.’.’

A bad ankle has been giving
Wessel trouble throughout the
year and lately he has been
having more trouble than usual.
“I guess I'm, getting old." he
joked. “It’s the ankle of my
hurdle foot and I strained it
pushing off. I think it should
be okay though.“

When. asked if he-had any
new dives for the competition
he explained, “I .have enough
trouble with the ones I‘m do-
ing now and my real problem
is going to be the gap in time
between each event - that's
one thing I could never cope
with."

Wessel was referring to the
hour lapse in time between each
dive. In all there are five pre-
liminary, three semi-final
and three final dives. The one

meter events are held on
Thursday, with the three-meter

Coach Lewis Reduces

.Mitt Squad To Thirty

Pitt coach, Bobby Lewis has
reduced his baseball squad from
approximately 60 to 30 players.

“I cut alot of freshmen."
stated Lewis. “I encourage them
to come back though. Between
now and then they can gain a
lot of experience playing ball-
experience they otherwise would-
n‘t get. due to the return of so
many starters.“

The squad now consists of
eight infielders. four outfielders.
five catchers. and 13 pitchers.
Lewis, however. foresees a fur-
ther reduction of players before
the season begins.

“A further reduction is com-
ing in the areas of pitching and
catching,” related Lewis. “Dur-
ing the season, I plan to carry
eight or nine pitchers and three
catchers.”

The mitters are still finding
the weather to be a major prob-
lem. Since the beginning of
spring practice on March 1st,
drills have been held outdoors
only once.

“The only time we’ve held
practice outside. was last Thurs-
day," commented the coach.
“It wasn’t a good practice
either. It was really co1d——our
hands stung when we caught
the ball and we couldn‘t get
loossened up. a

“The weather is really a
problem—I ,only wish we could
make a southern tour like some
other colleges do.”

Injuries have not added to
Lewis’ dilemma.

- “They all

said. The only injuries are

received by playing intramur-
al basketball."

As spring practice progress-
es, no one players performance

F rosh Cagers Bolster
Panther Hoop Squad

In Final Practices

by MARTY HELLMAN
Associate Sports Editor ,
Although the final game_of the 1970-71 basketball season was
several weeks ago ‘for the Panther hoop squad. Coach Buzz Ridl
has had the team practicing in order to get a jump on next season.

- Yesterday, the cagers concluded their workouts for the year. _ 

A few of the freshmen from the outstanding Cub squad joined the
varsity ranks in the final practice sessions until October.

Unfortunately. Ridl has been
unable to assemble the entire
team for any of the drills due
to injuries and sickness.

“We haven’t been able to get
as much done as we had hoped
for,” explained Ridl. “A lot of
the players have been hurt.”

Besides Cleveland Edwards.
who was sidelined all year
with a knee problem, Buzzy

Harrison and Bob Cizmarik
have both missed the prac-
tices due to injuries. *

Mickey Martin, the frosh‘s
leading scorer, could not par-
ticipate because of a flu
attack.

Assistant Coach Fran Web-

ster " commented that, “There
will be a couple of good sopho-
mores next season that will
be fighting for the starting
positions. In the first week, we
got them used to our defense,
and we just started working
them into the offense.”

Even though the coaches
have been unable to gather the
entire complement of cagers.
Ridl was pleased with the pro-
gress made.

“I think that we did accomp-
lish a lot," he said."We've made
a few changes in the offense
because of a few of the per-
sonnel that we are picking up.
We‘re trying to improve our

inside game.”
Presently’, Ridl is unsure
whether or not Carl Morris

will have to undergo surgery
in the off-‘season for his knee.
“He’s able to go pretty well on
it right now, but he may need
it.”
