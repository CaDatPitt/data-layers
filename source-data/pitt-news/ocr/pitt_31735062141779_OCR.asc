In Celebration

Downtown. _ Parade ‘Ends
as Students Crash
‘Theater Doors _

Men Get He iring Today

An overﬂowing of student exuber-
ance after Notre Dame's surprising
defeat at the ha.nds of Pitt Saturday,
culminated yesterday in the hasty dis-
missal of classes on the campus for
the day, student parades over the
campus and downtown sections of the
city, the storming of theaters, and the
arrest. of four University students as
a result of a hilarious violation of Pa
Pitt's ordinances respecting peace
and-quiet.

Homer Collins, Eng. '33, and Hyman
Pober, Col. '35, were arrested for dis-
orderly conduct; Robert McClure,

Col. '36, was arrested on a charge of S

-violation of city ordinances, and
M, A. Ros-enbloom, Col. '33, alleged
to have crashed a door in one of the

theaters, was taken to the Central

police station on a technical cha.rge
of being a suspicious person. The
four students were released after
four hours incarceration, on bail, to
have a hearing this morning at 9
o'clock in Morals Court. .
Migrate to Tech Campus

The disorders were the result of
a migration of students from the Uni-
versity campus after being released
from classes after a football holiday
had been declared by Student Coun-
cil. Students, yelling “We beat the
Irish” formed- their ﬁrst parade on
the campus by Thaw Hall and pro-

.. ceeded to the Carnegie Tech camp-

us through Hotel Schenley and the
streets of the Oakland district.

When the Pitt adherents attempted =

to send up their war whoop of vic-
tory in front of the Administration
building on the Tech campus, and to
enter the building and. found it
bolted against them, they turned and
headed for the downtown section.
All routes led downtown-—the Boule-
vard- of the Allies,, Forbes street, and
Fifth avenue, each having its share
of cheering students.

Police Considerate

Accounts of theseveral clashes be-
tween students and police varied.
Most reports seemed to indicate that
the city's officers of the law resorted
to force only in extreme instances,
when it appeared that the
crowds might. cause some property
idjamage. , '

Traffic policemen, standing by good-
naturedly as the carloads of shouting
students passed through the streets
of downtown Pittsburgh, had only a
word of warning for the men and wo-
men t.o “ha.ve a good time, but don’t

. destroy anything.”

The only damage reported to police
was thecrashing of a lobby door in

a downtown theater when attendants ,

attempted to repulse the ﬂow of incom-
ing students. Other theaters, appar-
ently wise by experience, allowed the
mixed crowd of students to enter un-
resisted. No damage was reported
committed by students many of the
latter places.

“Free” Entertainment

The management of one motion
picture theater reported that approx-
imately 725 students had been admit-
ted free of charge in the ﬁrst rush
yesterday morning. Other similar
establishments netted several hun-
dred student customers, most of them
having a bit of entertainment “on
the house." The city's only burlesque
theater, the traditional rallying point
in past’ student demonstrations, had
almost 400 celebrating {undergradu-
ates for its afternoon matinee, none
of them invited, but admitted, never-
theless, at a special reduced price.

The line of cars, loaded with cheer-
ing students far beyond their capac-
ity, passed -from the University camp-
us to that ‘of Carnegie Tech, to the
Duquesne University campus and
then on into the Golden Triangle.
Groups paused before one of the bewa-
paper buildings and cheered for their
favorite sports reporters.

Following the.arrest of the four
who were taken to Central police sta-
tion, several hundred protesting stu-
dents paraded touthe Water street
building and shouted for the release
of their unfortunate classmates.

Joe E. Brown, who presented
his best smile at the Pitt-Notre

his praise of the Golden »Pan.thers.

, “Boy, oh boy.,,oh boy, did wewin

dent representative from Student
Council, will elect the student chair-
man for the drive. Additional cler-
ical help is being. quartered In the
special campaign headquarters in the
Y hut. _

“If the students on this campus
would give to the Welfare Fun-d just
a small .-fraction of what they spend
Ior amusements during theyear, the
campaign will total five times zlast
year's amount,” remarked: Mr. Men-
denhall. He said that -Pitt students
spent $150,000’-for dances, fraterni-
ties, and shows last year. The quota
of $10,000 was oversubscribed last
year, he announced, but only $2,100
of the amount was donated by.stu-

paign among the faculty and mem-
bers of the_ administration.

News Is Only College Paper
To Publislr-Permanent
Historical Edition

 

YEAR: 2132 A. D.

PLACE: University of Pitts-
burgh Library. .
PERSONS: Two coeds.

“-Ooooh Look. What funny clothes
this girl wore. -
“Yeah. And— they beat Notre Dame
that year too! 12-0! Wish we could
do that this year.”,

“That picture of Chancellor Bow-
man looks pretty 3 good doesn’t -it,
after all these years?"

And what‘ were these coeds of years
hence talking about. You ask? Why,
they're reading the PITT NEWS of
today, the perpetual rag paper edi-
tion, of course. The football games,
the -dances, they fraternities, and
everything else that happens today
will be read by Pitt students 200
years from now just aseasily as you‘
are now reading this article.

Taking its place with the New York

the American Mercury, the PITT
NEWS will go down to posterity on
rag paper, a paper which will last
for possibly threehundred years, At
the completion of its regular run
thirty-ﬁve copies of the NEWS» are
printed on this special paper. The
PITT NEWS is the only college paper
in the country publishing a‘ permanent

l Open Sandwich Shop

record of undergraduate history.

Along with the Papyri of ancient;
Egypt, the clay tablets of Babylon,|,
and the Gutenberg bibles the NEWS‘
joins the rank of the immortals. The
century-defying editions of the
NEWS will be bound and kept as per-j
manent and reliable records of the
history of the University of Pitts-;
burgh. A

Paper fls Costly

The rag-paper publication is the
result of the courageous program of
the Executive Board of the PITT:
NEWS. Although "rag-paper costs tenl
times the. amount-,.,.wliich is paid tori
Paper used in the regular editions of}
the PITT NEWS, the Board consider-}
ed it a worthy investment in view of‘
the historical value of the publica-
tion.

J. Howard‘ Dice, University libra-
,rian, called the need of a permanent
record of undergraduate history to;
the attention of the NEWS Board. Mr,§
Dice pointed out that the copies of
the student publication now in posses-
;sion of the library are yellowed and
frayed though still comparatively
recent in a historical sense.

Although oridinary newsprint pa-
jper discolors quickly and rips easily,
‘rag-paper is known to possess pow-
ers of permanency and is not easily
‘torn. Chemical analysis of this spe-
!C1al. paper reveals that it will endure
-;lIl an excellent state of preservation
{for at least two hundred years.

E Common newsprint is manufactur-
ed from what is known as ground-.
[wood which is the most perishable of
,-any of the types of wool used in
paper manufacture. It has a very
-short life and deteriorates quickly in
the sunlight. A special process of
lag-paper manufacture made of linen
rags make it less susceptible to the
destructive qualities of light and it re-
tains its gloss and texture for cen-
turies.

Two copies of the rag-paper edition
are now sent to the University libra-
1'3’. Other copies are delivered to
Chancellor ‘John G. Bowman; Mr. John
W..Weber, business manager of the
University; Walter J. Rome, assistant
dean, of men; Historical Society of
Pennsylvania; William Morrell, Uni-
Versity editor; and two copies are
being bound for the ﬁles of the PITT
NEWS.

Subscriptions for the rag-paper edi-
tion are being sold for $5.00 per year.
These papers will be delivered at the
time of publication. Bound volumes
of the perpetual edition can be sub-
scribed for at $7.00 -for the year
The bound volumes will be delivered
following the last issue of the paper
in June. .

"Lindbergh Does It,
But You Can't,"
G . Says, Rome

 

 

Walter J. Rome, assistant dean‘ of
men, warns students of the Univer-
sity who are thinking of going to the
Penn game on Saturday. In a letter to
the PITT NEWS he says, “The mile-
age from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia
is 298 miles. Lindbergh could make it
in two hours. A crack Pennsylvania
train probably make it in seven.
Barney Oldﬁeld might make it in six.
An average driver should take be-
tween eight and nine hours. What I
am driving at is that those students
who plan to drive to the Penn game
should remember that there will be a
lot of traffic on the Lincoln Highway
over the week-end, and it is far better
to get to Franklin ﬁeld an hour later

mittees:

vi-cal Engineering will present a dis-

.dustry and life.

.than not to get there at all.”

Student1Loan Committee is now '
operating a sandwich stand on
the eighth floor of the "Cathedral
of Learning. According to Frieda

' Goldstein, Col. - '35, chairman,
sandwiches and milk will be sold_
from 11:30 to 2:30 o'clock, at the
same prices as in Alumni and.
Thaw Hall. The reason for the
innovation is the increased need
for funds felt-by the Student
Loan Committee.

‘ Wires Message

Governor ‘Gifford Pinchot, who
was in—Pittsburgh Saturday for
the Pitt-Notre Dame game, wired
his congratulations to the Pitt
team and student _body in the
following message to the PITT
NEWS:

"‘That game Saturday was one
of the best I have seen since I
left-college. The playing of the
entire Pitt team was -an amazing

reversal of pre-game predictions
by the prominent sports writers.
It is practcially impossible to
pick out any stars; the Whole
Pitt team functioned _, perfectly.
But in my mind the turning point
of the game was that eighty-yard
kick by Hogan from under his
own goal post. The display of
spirit by Pitt's students was in

line‘ with its team's amazingly
ﬁne work against that great
Notre Dame machine.’ Pitt was

simply wonderful in victory, as
was Notre, Dame in defeat. I
only hope I have a chance to see
the two teams play again next
year. Please give my warmest
congratulations to the Pitt team.”

Health Service Establishes

Student Health Note‘ Books

 

Pitt has been the ﬁrst university
in .the country to develop the idea
of a health note—book to be kept by
students. In most colleges it has
been the custom to maintain a health
service merely to take care of the
medical needs of the students when
they became sick, many institutions
maintaining a department where only
emergency cases were taken care of.
It was considered of secondary im-
portance to educate the student in
health matters and to get him to take
an active interest in his physical con-
dition.

The student health service at Pitt,

headed by Dr. H. C. . Carlson,
has recognized the importance
of getting’ the cooperation of

the student himself. Instead of mere-
ly treating the student as the occa-
sion demands, Dr. Carlson hopes to
eliminate many of the minor ills

which so lower the efficiencyof a stu-‘

dent body by explaining their causes
and helping the individual to build up
a semi physical constitution.

In the plan as Worked out at

Pitt, each freshman student
will be encouraged to keep-
a notebook-3 of his own and
folders will be furnished by the

health service for that purpose. The
material in these note books is to be
made up of any ideas which the stu-
dent may get regarding his personal
health, He will also be expected to
keep a record‘ of the improvement in
his health under the guidance of the
health service. In addition, these
note books are designed to enable
the student to see the importance of
periodical physical examinations, and

to see that .good scholarship is de-

pendent largely upon good health.
In short—-if the student is made
to see that he must study and work

for the improvement of his phys.:lc.al,

condition, and not merely take. it as
a matter of course, the purpose of the
health book will have been ac-
complished.

‘ Eliminate Bid Sending

 

Panhellenic has abandoned Bid Day
in favor of a two-hour fall rushing
period, according to deﬁnite announce-
ment made this week by Jane Stover,
rushing rules chairman.

The new arrangement has been
planned to do away with the uncer-
tainty resulting from sending bids
without any previous rushing period
and yet to avoid the elaborateness and
expense characteristic of the three-
day fall rushing customary in former
years.

The complete ‘list of rul'es approved
by Panhellenic Council at its last
meeting is: V "

1. The only rushing event shall be con-
ducted Sunday, November 13, between 3 and

5 o’clock. This‘ will not be an open house.
(Each rushee may accept only one invitation.)

 2. _Invits/aions for this event shall be sent

November 7, 1932, and must‘ be answered in
writing by Thursday, November 10.

3. Bid Day shall be Tuesday, November 15.
On this date all bid lists shall be in Heinz
House at 9:30 a. m.

4 Ballots must be answered by rushees on
Friday, November 18, at 9:30 a. m.

Silence Week shall last from 5 o'clock
Sunday, November 13, to Saturday, November
19, at 12 midnight.

6. Fraternities will receive their lists on
Friday, November 18, at 9 1). m.

'7. Pledging shall be conducted Monday,

Chem. 'E's' ToiFigl1*
Fire With Snow
From Now One

The next time that you get all
“burned up” about some big assign-
ment or examination, call upon a
chemical engineering student for
help. He ought to be an expert be-
cause on Thursday the chemical en-
gineers were shown the new way to
put out a ﬁre. Instead of using the
old liquid ﬁre extinguisheiythe lucky
chemistry students know how to turn
the trick with a little bit of carbon
dioxide snow. Since it only took four
seconds to put out a ﬁre caused by
igniting tubs of alcohol, gasoline,‘ and
tar, in comparison to ten minutes by
the old method: your case, unless you
a.re out of control‘ when you apply for
help, can be remedied on the spot.

When you use the old method, the
liquid splashes and makes you look
like a mess: but carbon dixodie snow
is as clean as your latest joke. Fur-
ther more, the chemical engineering
students guarantee that the snow will
not injure the most skillfully applied
coat of rouge or the most perfectly
shaped cupid lips. _

-Drop around some day and allow
these ambitious students to prepare
you for your next quizz; so that you
may enter it calm and cool.

“The ﬁrst of the inonth” used to be a time of
.feverish activity for ledger clerks. But the Bell
System -accounting staff — breaking away from
tradition —— simpliﬁed the keeping of accounts and
rendering of monthly statements to customers.

They applied a modern system of rotation bill-'
ing to the telephone business which now spreads
this work evenly throughout the month. Inco-
operation with manufacturers, they devised spgcial
typewriters and bookkeeping "machines. Thus
they did away with ineflicient rush and achieved
greater accuracy, speed and neatness.

This is but one example of a point of View found
throughout the Bell System. Even long accepted’
routine is constantly studied— it’s always Worth,

Architects Submit Plans 0

For Psychiatric Hospital 

 

Action has ﬁnally begun on the
State Psychiatric Hospital to
erected at Thackeray and O'Hara
streets on land donated by the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh. Architects have

‘submitted their plans to the Public

Charities Association, and the State
has made an‘ initial appropriation of
$25,000.00 toward the $2,000,000.00 of
the hospital's cost. The building itself

will have a capacity of approximately
200 beds, ﬁfty of which will be devoted
to children.

The hospital,‘which was established
at the 1931 session of the Legislature,
is part of an immense building pro-
gram launched in 1925 for State Wel-
fare institutions for the ‘insane, the
feeble-minded, the epileptic, the ju-
venile delinquents, and adult offenders.
To date, more than $25,000,000 have
been spent building new structures
and improving old ones.

Mental and Nervous Treatment

The Psychiatric Hospital is designed
to give the, same quality of medical
and nursing- care to. mental and nerv-
ous patients as general hospitals can
give to patients suffering from more
common maladies. Treatment of im-
provable curable cases is the prime
aim of the hospital, and emphasis will
be placed upon the large group of
cases which can be helped either
within a reasonably short time or can
be sufﬁciently readjusted to keep them
out of mental hospitals, It will deal
with obscure, problematic and border-
line cases and nervous conditions due

to physical disease. Patients in these.

be , groups will be referred by physicians,‘

general hospitals, mental hospitals,
schools, courts, prisons, reformatories,
and welfare and social agencies.
Through its out-patient clinic, the-
hospital will _treat ambulatory or visit-
ing clinic patients in co—operation with
physicians,_hospitals, and welfare or-
ganizations of this city. Patients
paroled or discharged from its own

wards and from mental hospitals for '

convalescenc_e may ‘attend the clinic
for continued observation and" home
treatment. In this way, tendencies
which favor relapse will be anticipated
and forestalled.

Education and Training

The Psychiatric Hospital will be a. 

teaching center for the medical and
nursing professions in the principals"
and objectives of mental‘ and nervous
medicine and hygiene. It will serve
as an institution where physicians,

medi-cal students, internes, p-sycholo,-"I ‘

gists, social workers, and nurses may
be“ taught psychiatry and obtain prac-
tical clinical experience.

Located, as it will be, in ‘a medical I

and educational center, the hospital-
is ideally situated; and while itwill
not be an integral part of the Pitt
School" of Medicine, itwill have a
close aﬁiliation. .

It is estimated that the hospital will
save the state vastvsums of money
through preventative measures by tak-
ing care of defectives before their con-
ditions become serious; t.hus «follow-’
ing the adage that, “An ounce of pre-
vention is worth a pound of cure.”

HE CRY of “On to Pennsyl-
vania!” voiced in these col-
umns last Friday we amend to-
day to read “On to Pennsylvania’
—Cautiously! ” «

In spite of theifact thatmany
Pitt students will take advantage
of the ‘low bus rates offered by
the NEWS- and the proportion-
ately, low rates offered by -the ..
railroads for the tripto the‘ Uni!
versity of Pennsylvania, there
will be a great body of others
who will take to the highway in
privately owned and hired auto-
mobiles. Already owners of ’
campus ﬂivvers have closed deals
that will assure them of capacity J
loads for the‘ trip.

Most of this latter -group will‘
leave Friday._ evening - and drive

' all night in order «to arrive in -
Philadelphia early enough to rest
before the game. Darkness, the
crowded highway, and the possi-
bility of bad Weather will threat-
en the drivers of these..cars- from
the very beginning. Added to this
is the very danger of the route it-
self. The Lincoln highway crosses
some of the most Atreacherous
mountain country ‘in Pennsyl-
vania. ,

It scarcely should be neces-
sary to suggest the dangers of such
a trip, the factors that threaten
the safety of a band of carefree
students on a holiday. -But the
_dangers, as has been proved in
the past, are. there. Regardless
of available’ time, students will

. hurry to reach their objective,
pushing their cars at unnecessary
speeds for the 300-mile drive. A

Two years ago a similar trip to
West Virginia claimed the li-fe of
one" Pitt student. That was a
highway casualty, the sort of ~
thing that may happen today or
tomorrow to any one of us, but
.which may be averted by simple,
precautionary measures. V .

To make the Penn game and
trip. as complete a success for the
team followers as last Saturday’s
Stadium .victory, we urge every
touring student to exercise the-
maximum of caution .by taking all
the time that is needed for the

trip and by observing the rules

v community a chance

With only four more days until‘
the political symposium, sponsored by
the Al1egheny_Co-unty League of Wo-
men of Voters in conjunction with the
University debating association, pre-
sents a student concensus on_ the ma-.
jor parties in the presidential cam-
paign, enthusiastic endorsement of
the plan has been made by loca1-po-
litical leaders and a Pitt professor of
political -science. The symposium

~ will take place at 8:15 o’clock Friday
night in the Schenley High School au- _

ditorium. ‘
‘.‘I am well pleased with the idea,"

. was the comment of W. H. Coleman,

Allegheny county chairman of the
Republican party and former Con-
gressmuan. “It is most commendable
that students should’ listen to discus-
sion of issues from all sides. Young
men starting .in life should realize
the responsibility of citizenship, and,
whatever political‘ faith they have,
they should have "a reason for it.”
David L. Lawrence, Democratic
county chairman, expressed hearty
approval of the symposium. “I think
that it is an extremely commendable
idea that the University of Pittsburgh
debating-association shoud sponsor a
at this t'ime,” the political ‘leader
said. “Student representatives of
Princeton,-Virginia, and Pittare well
ﬁtted to discuss the issues of the
campaign. Their studies in the ﬁeld

J of the social sciences will aid them

to discuss party platforms
ligent manner.” » .

“Only when the American people
gain a complete understanding of the-

in an intel-

elect the best representatives to gov-
ernment positions,” asserted Dr. W.
J. Van Essen, Socialist candidate for
United States senator and county
chairman of the Socialist,party. “Col-
lege students ‘who are interested in
political questions should have a well-
founded knowledge of economi_c prob-
lems,— and I‘ am sure that the speak-
ers at the political symposium will
render a real service to the people in
stressing the economic side of the
campaign.”

Giving his endorsement of the idea,
Elmer ‘Graper, head of the polit-

dent an opportunity to express -his
political opinions and to campaign
for his party is a ﬁne scheme.”

“The chief purpose of Pitt’s polit-
ical symposium,” explained Dr.'W. M.
Parrish, coach of, the debating asso-
ciation, “is to give the people of the

university men and women really
think of politics. It is hoped that
these student spokesmen will present
clear, critical opinions.” ..

Six University speakers from three
leading schools of the East and South
will give addresses at the symposium.
Princeton will be represented by_a
Republican and a-Socialist, Virginia
by a Republican and a Democrat, and
Pitt by a Democrat, John P. Bracken,
Col. ’34, and a Socialist, Genevieve
Blatt, Col. ’33._ A '

The speakers will each talk for ﬁf-
teen minutes,_ with each party being
defended'by'"one spokesman and at-
tacked by another. After the sched_-
uled addresses have been concluded,
an opportunity will be given for rep-
resentatives of any other parties to

in behalf of their political group, and
mitted to question the speakers. ‘In

, _.With1the election one week off, and

«all indications of the result favoring

_ ‘_the' Democrats, the ‘Republicans ﬁnd
. themselves a little perturbed. In fact,

an unkind observer might not be far
that the G. O..P. is
downright frantic. ‘

One can hardly blame them. Both
major straw votes (the Literary Digest

._and_- the Hearst) give Roosevelt a fat

majority in the electoral college. In
the Digest Poll the Republicans hold
theedge in only seven or eight states.
And even granting a great inaccuracy,

I-(Pennsylvania, New York, Delaware,
etc.) will go Republican on.-Election

.A,.Day.,.Hoove,r will get at the most 202
xelectoral votes, leaving 329 for the.

Democratic. nominee.
Republican politicians have been

' busy explaining away the defeat ‘that

seems imminent for their candidate.
They point out that this straw ballot-

- _ aing took place before Mr. Hoover be-
’ _gan' his Big Push. To accept the view

that the Digest Poll is inaccurate on
these grounds is to accept the view
that Hoover'has captured votes by his
speeches of the last few weeks-. And

, that. is doubtful.

A -There are in every ‘election people
who are going to vote the ticket they

 have always voted. .These are the

dyed-in-the-wool Republicans of the in-

1 "dustrial-North, and the sentimental

Democrats of the South. Mr, Hoover,
it seems-to me, has made sure of that
Northern support which every Repub-
lican, who ever _bothered to bid for,
It did not take much coax-

astray by the ringing phrases of
A Even ‘Charley Curtis
could have done that.

There remain a. good many sore-
heads—-a good manyipeople who be-

lieved Hoover in ’28 when he promised
‘A eternal prosperity. They are th_e peo-

ple who have really felt insecurity.
They -are the laborers and manual
workers to whom depression means

These are the peo lewho are going
to defeat Hoover. epublicans could
have -orated and- coaxed from August
1 until 12 p. m. of November 7 with-'
out budging this class. For by some
political hocus-pocus, the story has
got around that Roosevelt is a pro-
gressive.

It is no reflection on these dissatis-
ﬁed individuals that they have -been
taken in by a pseudo-progressivism.
With L Follete and Norris on the
Democra ic band wagon, it is extreme.
ly difficult to tell which is which.

Pro-Democrat newspapers are as re-
sponsible .for the confusion about
Roosevelt’s' convictions as anybody.
By manipulations and partial quota-
tions from his speeches, they" have
made him a Big Navy Man, A Medium
Sized Navy Man, A Foe of the Utili-
ties, a. Conservative-Progressive, and
a Progressive-Conservative. .I am sure
that Mrs. Roosevelt could discover
some surprising things about her hus-
band if she consulted the papers that
are his staunchest partisans, '

Last week, for instance, a Pittsburgh
newspaper, that has apparently sup-
ported Roosevelt because it could not
support Hoover, delivered a- scolding
to the Governor of this state for his
failure to endorse the, Democratic
nominee. As this editorial pointed
out, progressives of the.same variety
as Mr. Pinchot have endorsed Roose-
velt; ergo, it is the duty of.Mr. Pin-
chot to join in on the endorsement.

Such meanderings about the syllog-
ism are, of course, ‘easier to explain
than to believe Ain. Those‘ western

Continental Students Are More‘ Serious Says ‘Augusta.
Harkanyi, Who Returns to Hungary Soon

a—____.

By Helen Lay .

If youwerc a student in a European university, you would not
cheer at football games, belong to a Greek letter fraternity, take any
business courses, or even have conferences with the dean of women.
“The European university has much the same organization as a.

medieval university,”

says Augusta Schutz—Ha1-kanyi, who has a

_t<=acher’s diploma from the University of Budapest and is now study-
ing at Pitt to be a dean of women. “A student in the University of

Budapest would not take courses in%

business administration, journalism, or
any other vocational subject. Only
the teacher must have a general ed-
ucation. '

There are four classes or facultates
in which the courses are grouped-—
philosophy, theology, medicine, and

law. The only degree given is a doc-

tor's degree, which may take a stu-
dent anywhere from four to eight
years to obtain. A teacher's diploma
may be procured after ﬁve years of
study. Consequently fewer Europeans
have a college education.” '
-Fraternity-minded Americans would
not be able to ﬁnd a chapter of their
brotherhood in any foreign school.
Student associations take the place
of Greek letter frats. Miss‘Harkanyi
belonged to a. Protestant association
which took care of social affairs, po-
litical, social service and religious in-
terests. . Instead of football or base-
ball teams, the University of Buda-
pest has an athletic association for
men and women students,_ which

sponsors swimming, tennis matches,

hiking, rowing teams, s'kiin~g,“ and
other sports. This club also takes
care of any intercollegiate meets the
school may have. The only publica-
tion of the University of Budapest is
a humorous publication which comes
out once "a semester. (Panther editors
please note).1 A _

Miss Harkanyi is leaving for Hun-
garynext February where-she hopes
to obtain a position as dean of wo-
men. “I chose that profession be-

cause there is no dean of women in
European univeirsities and I, felt
there is a lack in.that respect.” Au-
gusta is an exchange student at Pitt
and has been working here on a state
scholarship. She speaks four lan-
guages, Hungarian-, French, German,
and English. _ ,

“Although it was hard at the be-
ginning, I have enjoyed the experi-
ence" of being in America. But, of
course, after two years away from
home, I.wil1 be glad to get back to
Hungary.”

By Panthers
I2-O In Upset

Sebastian’s ‘ll-6-Yard ’Run and
Dai|y‘s Interception of
Pass Provide Scores

 

Stands Cheer Victory

Notre Dame’s touchdown-a-minute
wrecking crew was caught “out to
lunch” by Pitt Saturday afternoon on
the Stadium ﬁeld. Not only that, but
the Golden Panthers, adding insult to
injury, stole the lunch of the Irish
Ramblers, and eliminated that team’s
hopes of going through this 1932 grid-
iron season without falling from the
undefeated list. ‘ p C

What a show was that 12 to 0 de-
feat administered by the Golden Pan-
thers to their South Bend -opponents
For three full quarters, Jock Suther-
land -saw his proteges pushed closer
and closer to their goal line, to have
them stave off temporarily the march
of the Irish; to have most of those
fateful quarters played in’ the Pan-
ther’s side of playing ﬁeld, and then

Hogan Intercepts Pass
With ﬁve full minutes of the ﬁnal
quarter gone, with Notre Dame edge-
ing toward Pitt’s goa1 line for the

sixth time that afternoon, after being
denied «a score a few moments before,
when Hogan kicked out of danger un-
der the shadow of his own goal line-
a beautiful 80-yard punt. Kokenthrew
a long pass, supposedly to Melinko-
vich, and instead of racing-«toward
his own goal line, he found himself
‘tackling: Hogan who had intercepted
that pass on the latter’s 26-yard line.
The Panthers, who had been sharpen-
ing their claws during the previous
periods: of the game, decided it was
high time to see how they clawed.

And claw ..they did. On fo._ur plays, ,
which ended in Mike Sebastian's 46-}
yard dash to the Notre Dame goal;
line, the Panthers threw the entire.

_Notre Dame team intoutter disorder

to place the.ball over Notre Dame's

goal line for the ﬁrst time this year. I '

It was then that the Panthers "held ,

hope of stopping that last few min- .' -

ute rush which they knew was com-
ing, when. only two plays after the]
kickoff, Ted Daily intercepted Mc-
Guff’s -pass on the Notre Dame 20-
yard line to scamper across the Irish

ernoon, to prove, that the ﬁrst touch-
down was true . . . the stands going
wild with joy. I
Was Greatest Upset

Demoralized was the only word for
the Irish Ramblers after that second
touchdown. Pass after pass the Irish
threw, but to no-avail, the game was
Pitt’s—-—the greatest upset in the coun-
try that afternoon.

Games may ‘come and games may
go, but none will erase that game,

ory of the 65.000 packed in the Sta-

sports writers in the press boxes.A
few faithful souls believed Pitt would
take the Irish Saturday afternoon, but

doir, were a Little uneasy. Had they
made a rash promise? Nobody held
out any hope that the Golden Pan-
thers would take that game. What
arguments had they to offer?

But after that game, the “I told you
so’s” were very much in evidence,‘
and those Who, had believed that Pitt
would come out on top were quietly
ruminating over their good fortune in
being able to pick a winner, without,
what they thought, suﬁicient reasons.

John ’Michael Sebastian covered
himself with glory Saturday a.fter-
noon, as did Skladany,. Daily, Hogan,
Walton, Tormey, Heller, Weinstock-
you may as well include them all. It
was a team that was not to be denied
victory, one that before the game
very few. held out for, but after the
game everyone believed them the
best pals in the world.
ends, Pitt 12, Notre Dame 0 . . . the
Irish myth of an unbeaten team now
swallowed by the hard facts of defeat
. and by Pitt of all teams.

Was Pitt's 12 Points

Facts of the game as presented by
statisticians show that Notre Dame
garnered 16 ﬁrst downs to 6 by Pitt,
but the latter gained 10 yards’ more
than their Irish opponents in rushing.
Notre Dame threw 26 forward passes
to Pitt’s 3. 10 of those 26 gaining 187'
yards, which can not be construed as
being very much when the passing}
prowess of the Irish are considered.
But it was Pitt’s 12 points that sealed
Saturday’s game.

With everyone cheering and hail-
ing the Panthers as the miracle team
of the season, it might pay us to re-
Ian and start passing out the credit
where it belongs.

‘Coach Sutherland naturally
shares top honors for developing
the team to a point where they
could stave off a Notre Dame
rush for three periods and then
come back to coast in to vic-
tory.

It is much harder to pick out the
individual players on the Pitt team.
It was necessary that all play won-
derful ball, or the work of one ‘would
have been unnoticeable.

First of all, we can take ‘Mike
Sebastian. The Sharon speeder
showed just why- he is playing at
the right halfback position Sat-
urday. His running was hard
and fast, and several times, l:
was his tackling that prevented
an Irish touchdown. His touch-
down run couldn't have been
improved upon. ’
Warren Heller performed his usual

lion’s share of the work. His tackles
throughout the game were hard and
sure enough to please everyone but
Notre Dame backers.

?Muggsy Skladany and Tiger
Walton did. more to stop the Irish
rushes that may have been im-

the Pitt men who played:

agined. Both boys were in there
so fast that the Irish backs must
have wondered where their own
forwards were. Notre Dame ad-
vi'so'ry coaches picked Walton as
the best linesman on the ﬁeld.
Skladany rushed the pa-sser so
often that the crowd merely
Watched to see how long it took
him to bring down the Irishman.
The listpcould go on to mention‘ all
Mungas,
the sophomore quarterback, handling
his ﬁrst assignment in big-time foot-
ball; Weinstock playing -with a.
broken nose, and in terrible pain;
Dailey, who made the second touch-
down although not in the very best of
health; and so on down the list. They
all deserve special mention, and it’s
just about time that they get it from
the student body.

With all the gaining that
Notre Dame was making, statis-
tics show that, in the matterof
net yardage, Pitt led by .three
yards. Incidentally, the Panthers,
who were supposed to rely on-
passes, only threw two, none of
which were completed.

The press boxes were so ﬁlled that
a double line was formed in the rear.
The big mistake was putting a police-
man with a German goiter to stand
inside, The sports writers and
scouts were hardly able to get around
his stomach. More than twenty-two
dozen sandwiches were eaten in the
press boxes alone. ‘

Two-Year Contract H olds
Sutherland At Pitt

 

 

BULLETIN

 

In an interview with the Pitt
News late yesterday Dr. John B.
Sutherland stated that the reports
that he had been offered a coach-
ing job at Yale University were
absolutely unfounded. Dr. Suther-
land said, “Reports that I have
been offered the ‘job as head
coach at Yale University are en-
tinely foreign to me. I have
never seriously considered leav-
ing the Unlverslty of Pittsburgh.
I know nothing whatever about
the rumored offers."

_.

As a startling aftermath to the sur-
prising Panther upset over a ﬁghting
Notre Dame eleven comes the an-
nouncement that “Coach Jock Suther-
land has been tendered an offer to
coach Yale University.

Yale’g football status has not been
the same since the M_erriwe11 boys de-
parted in a blaze of glory, and the
attempt to have Sutherland bring a
drooping “bulldog” to life is probably
the motive behind the generous Eli
offer. . Pitt students, who suddenly

awoke with a’ sense of—school spirit,

will undoubtedly ﬁnd some comfort in
the news that -Sutherland has a con-
tract calling for two more years at
Pitt. .

After the upheavel ‘that took place
at the Stadium last Saturday, itiis
hardly likely that the student body,
which up to now has shown little or
no interest _in the football team,
would welcome ' the resignation of
Sutherland to take up coaching duties
at another college. Sutherland re-
fused to comment on the Yale oﬁer.

Several reports have come to light
on the proposed offer, one stating ,that
Yale had invited Sutherland and his
entire coaching‘ staff to take up head-
quarters at Yale. This rumor has
neither been affirmed or denied.

Dr. -Sutherland, a‘ star pupil of
“Pop” Warner took up the coaching
duty at Pitt in 1924, succeeding “Pop"
Vvarner. Previous to this, Sutherland
had coached in the Army for two
years and at Lafayette.

_At Pitt, Sutherland has turned in
one of the most impressive football
records compiled in the entire coun-
try. His teams have won 62, lost 12,
and tied six, winning the Eastern title
three times and twice representing
the East in, the annual Tournament of
Roses Game at Pasadena, California.

the Pitt freshman football team ex-
tended its winning streak to four

The game was even up to the end,
with “Skip” Gougler’s Little Panthers
punching over a touchdown in the last
two minutes of play, Malarkey, half-
back, again led the Pitt attack. Ma-
larkey received a West Virginia punt
on the Mountaineer’s twenty—ﬁve yard
line and ran it back to the nine. An
oifside penalty .put the ball on the
four-yard line, and on the third down’,
Malarkey slid through tackle for the

still, that was not enough to convince
Signor Blanco-Fombona. Then Profes-

he was almost embraced! (Yes, La.t-
ins are that way). “Italian!” That
meant Latin. And Latins were peo-

This ‘story about Ruﬁno Blanca-
Fombona is going to be especially in-

of Spanish and Latin-American his-

delightful novel, “The Iron Man."
Ruﬁno Blanco-Fombona Wrote it, al-
though you did not read it as he wrote
it, but as Isaac Goldberg translated it.

Professor De Vitis, head of the
Spanish department, had heard so
many interesting tales of Ruﬁno

visit him_ when he went‘ to Spain.
This important writer's ﬁrst impres-
sion upon our worthy Spanish profes--
sor was his exteremely handsome ap-

Mike Sebastian, whose sensational
play this -season ,has.won him a var-
sity berth over Captain Reider, is al-
ready receiving rewards for his per-
formances. . 9 ‘ .. .

Sebastian's performance against
play in other
Panther games has resulted in an
offer to play ‘on an All-North team
that will engage. an All-South team
at the Baltimore Stadium, December
10. The invitation was extended
through Coach Sutherland by Mayor
Howard W. Jackson of Baltimore.

Qoach Sutherland will handle the
Northern team in this tilt, and it is

quite likely thatosebastian will accept
the . invitation. .

‘Will Be’ Back

Columbia Broadcasting Syste-m’s
sportsgabber, Ted Husing, believes
that Saturday’s game was one of the
greatest he ever
witnessed. After the
game, turning to
Frank Carver, di-
rector of publicity
at the Stadium, he
said, “You fellows
won’t give me a
break when I want
it. When Army
came here last year
you weren’t expect-
ed to win. And now
this game.” Frank
I Carver, »-retorting to
,his outburst, said,
“Ted, the Stadium’s
yours. You’re wel-
come any time you
come, when you
bring us such luck.”
._But it was not
luck that Pitt turn-
ed the tables on the
Irish, believes Ted,
for “Pitt has one
of the greatest
teams in this coun-
try - and don’t let
anyone let you be-
lieve differently.”
