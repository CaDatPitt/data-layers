AT AUGUSTA
ARSENAL

_‘Elliobt B. McGrew, ’l7, writes the
Secretary from Augusta Arsenal, Ga.,
L V some gossip
which we are sure will be interesting
reading to Pittites. He attended the.
Ordnance School at the University

of Michigan. He says in part:

“I devour the letters from “Jack”
Thompson, “1—"at" Herron and “Bill" Ar-
thjur--three fellows from Pitt for whom
I had 1 great deal of admiration. They
are boys who are the chevaliers of this
war-——the airmen.

“After I finished my course here I
wasmade a. sergeant and retained in the
I,have
been hammering the typewriter and do-
ing some of the administrative duties
and have caught the hang of it fairly
well. Have been hearing right along
from "Chip" Jenkins and Howard Wentz,
who are with the Pitt Base Hospital
Unit. They seem contended and com-
fogrtable. From what “Chip" says he
has about the same job as I have here.
as when he wrote. last he ‘was in the

imlddle of the February‘ pay roll while

I was making out mine for March. The
one predominant theme in‘ the letters I
receive is the idea of the big home com-
ing. Gee, Won’t that be some day?

;‘I,have seen a. lot of Pitt men down
here whom I knew and a.. lot I didn't
luiow._ Have. seen Dr. Jenkins several
times,’ Harry Daugherty, C.har1ie‘Ga.ut,
Don Leonard and others.

"Sunday night Dr. Me-Cox-mick was
down‘here at the Presbyterian church
and the house was packed. He made
a. wonderful impression with the people
and I was proud to say that I came
from a U iversity of which he was the
head. e surely‘ delivered‘ ‘ a. -great
speech on our present great problems."
