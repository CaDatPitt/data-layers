1  THE MODERN CHRISTMAS.

 

‘ In our mad rush to make _ ready
  every detail for the celebration of
Christmas, let us pause for a, moment
1 and recall the old english ideal; the
' » old ideal which‘ had just the correct
. combination of ‘jolly pagan festival
’ and glorious Christmas holy day.
- _ There were the bright eullogy, then
 games and the stories and_the happy
 family gathering such as_D1ckens tells
j , us of ' and then,,the holy_ carols and
*  the Christmas‘ anthem. This was truly
 ‘the Christian Christmas, and every
I  'N;rnemb,er of ‘the family realized its
 fullest significance. _
Nowadays we can hardly ﬁnd either
-.  of these sacred elements. 3 The Christ-
,  mas’ catch-word which used to be
1 . “God rest you, merry _gentlemen,7’ has
become “do your Christmasshopping

not. get the real pleasure that the child

thing is ‘material. We almost meas-

BEST WISHES. 1 _

The PITT WEEKLY extends bes
wishes to all its readers during the
holiday season. We hope that every-
one will have a most enjoyable vaca-
tion, and will enter the.new year with
resolutions to make 1915 the best yet.

RESOLUTIONS.

wisdom to call Herman, the brother of
our beloved classmate, Clyde B. Lamp,
we, the class of 1916, of.-the ’Medical

MILITARY SCIENCE COURSES-

As announced in the last issue of
the WEEKLY, the number of classes

company attendance will be possible
at each period. The-periods decided
upon are those which were best attend-
ed during the last term: the ﬁfth
periods on Monday’, Wednesday and
Friday. If these periods will not cor-
respond with your new schedule, the
omatter should be repo ed to those in
charge and new classes, will be or-
ganized for twenty men or over.

The University Chorus has come to

the organization. Not only  s. its’
presence at the University assembly

of the “music, and the entertainment
of the student body, but the _choru.s
has formed a permalnent orgliinizagion

A number of responses have been
received already in connection with
the article appearing in the Alumni
columns of THE WEKLY asking the
opinion of Alumni, especially those
who have participated in athletics, re-
garding the one year residence rule
to govern athletics. The question of
whether we shall have this rule will

be brought up for "action at. the next

meeting of the Athletic Council in
January, and the opinions of alumni

’ will have much weight in; deciding the

issue.

_The letters thus far speak in-favor
of its adoption as it seems to be the
consensus of opinion that this will dc
more than anything else to give us
proper standing with the larger col-
leges _in athletics and take usaway
from the general class of schools
which are constantly under ﬁre on
account of alleged lax rules. 

.What do alumni think/of the rule ?_
Do they think we are ready for it?
If against it, state why. A

CHANGE or ADDRESSES.

_ Alumni will confer a great favor on
the General Secretary if they will
notify. him promptly of change in‘ ad-
dress. This is particularly true of
the alumni who are paid up members

of the Association and who get THE.

’WEEKLY. The Post Office authori-
ties make it a rule to send a form to
the Secretary when a paper is going
to the wrong address and the record
of the THE WEEKLY-Circulation De.
partment is changed -acordingly. As
a special check, lettersare being writ-
ten -to the alumni in each asking them
to «advise if they are getting the
paper at new address and if the new

address is appearing on the Weekly

wrapper.

We appreciate that nothing is
more exasperating to one who is in-
terested in affairs at “Alma Mater to

., get the paper only now and then and
usually having an- issue skipped at

a time when he or she was particular-
ly anxious to get it. Unless we hear
of these cases, however, we have no
way of knowing that everyone is not
getting the paper. I

_The alumni , mailing " list of THE
WEEKLY has been carefully checked
in this oﬁice and, so far as -we can

tell, the paper is getting to every‘
-paid up member.   1 , .

GIVE US THE NEws.5

If you hear of some thing concern-
inug a graduate of the University
which can be woven into a news item
to be run in these columns, don’t be
backward about sending it to the Gen-
eral Secretary. 'Such action shows
interest in Alma Mater on your part
and an inclination to help us make the
Alumni column-attractive. Or, if the
item is about your self-—-some new po-
sition you" have secured, something

At the present time, we have not
a satisfactony system for gathering
alumni news and until that is devised

we will have to depend on. the indi-__

vidual alumni and on the ‘occasional
stray item which may be picked up
personally,; or by the newspaper clip-
ping bureau.

s the system wehave planned, de-

vefbpes, we hope to have the Class

Life Secretaries assigned as news
gatherers for their class and have

them work out a separate system for

learning of all the doings of their
class mates. This is the plan adopted
at Yale, Princeton, Cornell, Ohio State
and other institutions where alumni
work is far advanced, and it has work-
ed very successfully. ‘

THE VARSITY < CLUB. A

'_ The scheme of organizing a var-
s1t_y club, which was announced’ in
this column in a recent issue of THE
WEEKLY, seems to have struck a

popular chord, judging by themnumer-.

remarks of those with whom the Sec-
retary has discussed the vmatter per-
