Dr. Detre won't leave Holland -

By Kathleen Scanlon
News Editor

Pitt’s senior vice-chancellor
for health sciences, who
announced his resignation in
the summer of 1992, will stay
for at least one more year,
even though some faculty
members are anxious for
change.

“We have been expecting for
three years that Dr. Detre
would be resigning  and now
it’s another year,” said
University Senate President
Keith McDuffie. “So we’ll be
into 1996, - . and it’s not clear
to me what the transition will

nuity?”

Because no replacement has
been found, Thomas Detre will
continue to serve as senior
vice chancellor and will
receive help from the newly
appointed associate senior vice
chancellor, James Herndon.
Herndon will also serve as
vice "president for medical ser-
vices of the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center.

“That decision was made to
provide some additional
administration assistance to
Dr. Detre,” said Leon Haley,
vice chancellor for student and
public affairs.

Two search committees for
Detre’s replacement have

ended with no one to fill the
p_0st. The committee searches
both ended with finalists for
the job, but the candidates
decided not to take it. In addi-
tion, _the second search com-
mittee was put on hold until a
replacement for J. Dennis
O’Connor, Pitt’s outgoing
chancellor, is named.

“I agreed‘ to stay on because
it is my expectation that it will
be up to a new chancellor, who
could be here in less than a
year [to name a replacement],”
Detre said.

McDuffie said it would have

made more sense to appoint an -

Smart eating in the summertime

By Kathleen Scanlon

The other day, Pitt senior Liz Beck bought

grapes.

“I never buy fruit,” she said, clearly amazed

at herself.

Even senior Jeff Meister wheeled his cart
through the produce section and picked up a

grapefruit.

“I usually buy ramen noodles, cans of soup,

macaroni and cheese,” he said.

So what could have caused such a drastic
change in these students’ shopping habits?

‘‘It’s the summertime — you’re wearing a
bathing suit,” Beck said, lying on the

Cathedral lawn in her bathing suit.

“The grass, the trees, the bushes remind you
of fruit,” Meister said, lounging on the grass

next IO a U66.

As students become more active in the sum-
mertime, they also become more conscious
about how they eat, said Shirley Haberman,
Health Education administrator.

McDuffie anticipates great changes for Pitt

By Linda Wisniewski

Asst. News Editor

Two weeks ago, Keith McDuffie was
elected to take over the position of the
president of the University Senate, after
James Holland served the maximum
term.

“I chose to run for the position because
of my interest in the university. I think it
is at a crucial point in history,” McDuffie
said.

McDuffie said he anticipates the uni-
versity will go through some major
changes once a replacement for
Chancellor Dennis O’Connor is found,
and that it will be a very interesting time
to be serving as president of the
University Senate.

McDuffie’s plans for the new school
year include three main goals. First, he
said faculty are very interested in the
review of the university’s planning and
budgeting committee and are very con-

. cerned that the search for a new chancel-

lor to replace O’Connor will be a suc-
cessful one. And lastly, they hope to
increase faculty interest in the Senate.

“We do not really get a big turnout for
the Senate meetings,” he said. “We would
really like to increase the interest’ of espe-
cially the younger members of the facul-
ty.” . V
The Senate will also help to advise the
committee that is in charge of finding a
replacement for O’Connor, but McDuffie
said he expects it will take at least a year.

“The faculty as a whole are looking for
somebody who understands the role of
faculty in a university, and what it is
we’re here to do, which is to teach and to
do research.”

McDuffie said he also hopes to target
budget concerns.

“This university is going to have to
downsize,” he said. “We can’t continue to
do everything and then some.

“It’s something you do when you’re on

a budget.”

He said they must determine what the

university is best at doing and try to
strengthen those areas.

said.

The University Senate is composed of
full-time faculty members and adminis-
trators, as well as part-time tenured facul-
ty and those retired faculty who choose to
participate.

“The idea is to share in the governing '

of the university,” he said.

However, the Senate is only an adviso-
ry committee. Its resolutions are not
binding.

He said an example of this would be A

The Pitt News, Wednesday, July 12, 1995

Yes, Pitt graduates do get jobs

By Julie D. Hannon
Staff Writer

A trip to the Placement

Service could be the begin-
ning of a future so bright,
you’ll have to wear shades.
A In 1995, the service
increased the number of
employers conducting on-
campus interviews by 19 per-
cent. The number of résumés
sent to employers increased
by 72 percent.

Several 1995 graduates,
two—and—a-half months after
graduating, have jobs, prov-
ing the growing

need to follow. If you follow
through step by step, you can
get a lot out of it,” said
Ritchie. “They answered the
smallest of questions, and
with a phone call I could find
what I needed.”

The opportunities that
Placement offers are at the
fingertips of every Pitt senior,
said Krosse. The only catch:
seniors must register and reg-
ister early.

“We are encouraged
because there’s an increased
number of opportunities we
can introduce to students,”

A number of options are
available to students search-
ing for a job, from attending
résumé—writing workshops to
meeting one—on-one with an
advisor. The office has even
set aside an hour twice a
week for walk-ins who can
be helped on a first come-
first serve basis.

Krosse said Placement is
doing its part by implement-
ing a proactive approach to
marketing Pitt students, and
he credits that approach with
the increase in on—campus
interviews and in the number

of résumés sent out

“We’re proud
of that number,
and again, it il.lus—
trates our proactive
approach,” said
Krosse.

“We have
more control over

you take advantage
of what the center offers, it
takes the load of knowing
where to begin off of your
shoulders. From there it’s not
so bad.” .

Placement arranged the on-
campus interview that award-
ed Noll a position as
Pittsburgh’s regional sales
manager of Lazarus.

About 2,000 graduates reg-

’ istered through the Placement

Service in 1995, but the exact
number of those placed in
jobs will not be available

until September. Placement’s

Associate Director Jeff
Krosse did say morethan 70
percent of those with jobs
remain in-state.

Another 1995 graduate,
Susan Ritchie, praised the
Placement Service for help-
ing her find a job.

“The office helped me
tremendously, and I would
definitely suggest it to those
who are entering the job mar-
ket,” said Ritchie. “They pro-
vided me with many inter-
views; actually there were
about 25.”

Ritchie graduated with a
Bachelor of Arts degree in
Information Science and is
working as an assistant pro-
gram analyst for Mellon
Bank. .

However, she warns stu-
dents of waiting too long to
get to the office.

“There is a schedule you

Krosse also said that he
sees a definite shift in “just in

be another reason the
resume-referral service is
effective.

°From page 2

Fact — Patients who have
come through mental illness
and have returned to the
community are apt, if any-‘
thing, to be anxious, timid
and passive. They rarely
present a danger to the pub-
lic.

.-You can’t talk to some-
one who has been mentally
ill.

Fact — Most recovered
mental patients are rational
and intelligent, and it is cer-
tainly easy to talk to them.

Presently, the program has
about 20 volunteers, but
there is a greater need. With
a waiting list of about 20 to
25 clients, Project Literacy
is looking for volunteers. '

“There’s always more of a
need than there are volun-
teers,” Stack said.

"Volunteers are required to
attend a 12-hour training
session given by the Greater
Pittsburgh Literacy Council,
which has been affiliated
with Project Literacy since
1980. These training ses-
sions prepare tutors for the
challenge of teaching adult
new readers.

Every tutor receives only

nu-.....n. '..y-.—u—-—- -1-‘... -. —- . .

 

one student to tutor at a
time. Before tutors are
given a student, they must
go through an interview and
screening to see if they" are
good candidates to become
tutors. _

“Anybody who would be
willing to make a commit-
ment to teach someone how
to read can become a tutor,”
Stack said. “It’s a rewarding
thing for the tutor
involved.”

There are no required
days or times for the tutor-
ing sessions, but the pro-
gram does require that they
meet at least twice a week
for an hour-and-a-half each
day. This allows the tutors
and students the ability to
plan tutoring sessions that
suit their schedules. All
teaching materials and stu-
dent booklets are provided
by the program.

Volunteers are needed
throughout the Pittsburgh
area, as well as right here in
Oakland. Volunteers must
make a minimum commit-
ment of six months. If inter-
ested in becoming a volun-
teer tutor for Project
Literacy, co_ntact - Cece

tarians, in weight loss,”
Haberman said. “In the sum-
mertime, international stu-
dents have come in also
because they’re trying to
adjust to American culture,
American food, American
supermarkets  A lot of stu-
dents come in concerned
about how to make residence
hall food work for them.”

A visit with Debbie Luffey 1

begins with the student dis-
cussing his/her goals ——
whether it be to lose weight,
to measure body fat or just to
feel more healthy.

After pinpointing specific
goals, Luffey asks the stu-
dent what a typical day’s
menu includes, from break-
fast to dinner, including
snacks and beverages. Then
she can give the student spe-

cific suggestions about how

to lower the fat in his/her
diet. . .
Through this process, stu-
dents can draw out “where
they want to go, what their
needs are,” Luffey said.
Based on that, “we make
specific goals.”

But even in the summer-
time, students still run into
the same obstacles they
faced armed with their diet
ambitions during the year -
there‘s never enough money,
or time, especially for those
living off—campus.

“Its so much easier to get
something and pop it in the
microwave,” said senior Inga
Khaitman, who is majoring
in health services.

“Eating on the run has
always been a problem for
students,” Haberman said.
“They grab what’s fast and
easy, and as a result, it’s not
a well-balanced diet. It
might have a lot of fat.”

Luffey offers many sug-
gestions about how to tackle
this problem. If a student can
devote part of one weekend
afternoon to make a large
salad or cook a simple meal,
such as a casserole, he/she
can stretch that to cover
meals during the week,
instead of eating out all the
time. '

This would mean the stu-
dent would have to set aside
a time to plan ahead. But it
would still translate into a

   
 
      

    

 

 

 

savings of time and money.
Buying a boneless, skinless
chicken breast, or a pack-
aged bag of cleaned lettuce,
is cheaper than ordering
pizza. And planning ahead
would save the student from
having to search for some-
thing to eat before every
meal. ‘’

diet foods, usually more
expensive. Luffey said she
can advise students about
which diet foods are worth
buying.

If a student doesn’t cook, it
may be wise for him/her to
buy pre-packaged meals.
Some pastas only need to be
heated up. Also, certain sta-
ples, such as bagels, breads
and pastas, are always good
to have on hand.

Students’ increased activi-
ty in the summer heat also
begs for more fluid intake.
Many students agree that,
even if not intentionally,
they end up exercising a lot
more in the summer.

Khaitman says her normal
exercise regimen only
includes sit-ups, but she’s
“definitely more active in the
summer.” She and Beck both
say they walk a lot in the
nice weather.

So, especially in the sum-
mer, everyone should drink
about five to eight cups, or
two liters, of water a day.

In trying to reach any diet
goal, it is important to set
short—term. as well as long-
term goals. If someone wants
to lose 100 pounds, it would
be discouraging to keep
thinking about that number,
rather than breaking it up
into shorter-term goals,
Luffey said

“The long-term goal can be
overwhelming,” she said. “If
you get lost in the middle, it
gets frustrating.”

But no matter how deter-
mined you are to reach your
health goals, don’t worry
about an occasional splurge.

“So, although we can
advise, we can’t make the
rules,” he said.

for at) longer than three years.
The job entails finding out

‘‘I can try to express the
faculty viewpoint as I under-
stand it, but I would never put
my own views forth as being
zithose of the faculty.

“You try to lead as effec-
*—tively as you can so that you
can represent the viewpoint
of the rnajority,” he said.
“You may disagree with
them, because you have a
right as an individual to dis-
agree.

“So, instead of an executive
kind of position, it’s a facili-
tative kindof position.”

McDuffie is a full professor
in the department of Latin
American literature, and has
always been very involved in
university affairs.

He was the first—ever acade-
mic dean for the Semester at
Sea program in the spring of
1981 and was the administra-
tive dean for it in the spring
of 1989. He was also the
chair of the department of
Hispanic languages and liter-
ature from 1975, when he
arrived at Pitt, until 1992.

McDuffie was very active
in the University Senate from
1975 to €985, serving as vice
president of the Senate in
1985. .

He also serves on the
Senate committee for the
University of Pittsburgh
Press, and in 1991, took on
the editorshipof the Revista
Iber0Americana, a journal
devoted to Latin American
literature and literary criti-
cism. He said the journal is
one of the oldest of its kind,
and has been at Pitt «since
1963.

Some faculty at Pitt recent-
ly launched a campaign to
unionize and are currently
seeking members before the
issue goes before the state
labor relations board this fall.
McDuffie said his recent
decision to join the faculty
union (United
Faculty/AAUP) in no way
will conflict with his position
as president of the Senate.

“I don’t think they contra-
dict each other,” he said. “The
Senate is advisory, and the
union and collective bargain-
ing issue  allows the faculty
to stand together on issues
and do it under state law.”

McDuffie said he joined the
union as an individual faculty
member, not as the president
of the University Senate.

“There are a lot of faculty I
would say who don’t like the

idea of having a union. They ’

may be unhappy about deci-

sions the administration,

makes, but they don’t want to
be a part of a union.”

for the health sciences,
because some faculty mem-
bers “really are ready for a
changef’

“It really has to do with the
personnel in the health sci-
ences and some very serious
problems in their relationships
with Dr. Detre,” McDuffie
said.

He said he could not com-
ment specifically on_ what
those problems are, but specu-
lated that one of the problems
in luring a new senior vice
chancellor to Pitt is that those
candidates did not feel free to
operate independently under
the current power arrange-
ment.

“A really strong leader isn’t
going to want to take orders or
follow the preceding regime.”

The new health sciences
team will allow Pitt to contin-
ue to reap the benefits of

Detre’s experience, Haley.

said. Detre came to Pitt from
Yale University to serve as
chair of the department of psy-

chiatry in 1973 and stepped up
to senior vice chancellor in
1984.

“It is very logical to detain
the person if they’re willing to
continue, on the premise that
we should take advantage of
their experience  and knowl-
edge,” Haley said.

According to a press release
issued by Pitt, interim
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
said that in order for Pitt’s
health sciences to move for-
ward, “it is essential that we
build upon the enormous
progress of the recent past.

“Because he has been the
principal architect of that
progress,. no one is better
equipped than Dr. Detre to
guide us in the year ahead. At
the same time, we must begin
building a strong foundation
for the leadership changes that
will inevitably come. The
appointment of Dr. Hemdon to
these senior leadership posi-
tions is an important step in
that direction.”

Herndon came to Pitt from

Brown University in 1988 to
serve as chair of the depart-
ment of orthopedic surgery. He
also serves as chair of the
Council of Clinical Chairs in
the School of Medicine.

McDuffie said he is con-
cerned that Herndon is being
groomed to replace Detre,
which would bypass the demo-
cratic principles of forming a
committee.

According to last Thursday’s

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,’

Nordenberg said he does not
anticipate that will be the case.

“I hope very much not,”
McDuffie said. “There needs
to be a national search, and I
think that all the different con-
stituencies for the health sci-
ences need to be consulted,”
McDuffie said.

Nordenberg could not be
reached for further comment
because he is out of the coun-

0 try.

Opinions
Say cheese, Susan!

In order to avoid his courtroom turning into a media circus
similar to the one in Los Angeles, Judge William Howard ruled
that there will not be cameras in his courtroom. This ruling
came only days before the jury selection for the nationally
known Susan Smith double homicide trial. Smith, accused of
killing her two sons (aged three and one) by strapping them into
a car and pushing it into a lake, will be tried without the nation
watching.

The judge in this case asserted his right to have the cameras
banned from his court. It is up to the presiding judge in every
case whether or not to allow video coverage of any specific trial.
In this case, however, The Pitt News believes Judge Howard
made a poor decision.

The image of the American justice system held by many peo-
ple today is. an image of lawyers screaming at each other, throw-
ing insults instead of evidence. The courtroom is not the hal-
lowed place of justice it once was, but a circus for over-paid,
windbag attorneys to argue semantics and the proper spelling on
a warrant. This is largely due to the enormous amount of public-
ity given to the O.J. Simpson trial, with its Robert Shapiros,
Johnnie Cochrans and Marcia Clarks. The Simpson saga has
exceeded a year in length and millions of dollars in expense. It
is no wonder the public is left with a less-than-favorable attitude
toward the American justice system. .

If Judge Howard would have allowed cameras into the Smith
courtroom, he would have given the public an opportunity to see
the real justice system at work. Smith will have no Shapiros or
Cochrans, not even a Clark. The trial will have a public defender
and an assistant district attorney, and a Southern judge in a
Southern court. (Have you ever seen My Cousin Vinny? It’s not
too far from the truth.)

Judge Howard had an excellent chance to redeem the image of
the-justice system in the eyes of the public, but he threw it out

7 the window along with the news cameras.

Stupid stunts in the sea

Greenpeace has once again shown its extraordinary talent for
acting ridiculously. The environmental group, on its most recent

‘ quest to save the planet from evil human inhabitants, sailed the

vessel Rainbow Warrior 11 into a nuclear testing area. The action
was an attempt to protest nuclear testing in the South Pacific.

Greenpeace’s ship was seized by the French government when
the environmental protesters refused to leave the area. When the
Greenpeace activists refused to leave the testing area, French
soldiers boarded the vessel armed with tear gas. Two dozen peo-
ple were seized along with the Rainbow Warrior 11.

The amazing stupidity of this stunt far eclipses the previous
spray-painting of seals and picketing Mitsubishi. Greenpeace
has crossed the line from trying to do a good thing for the envi-
ronment to terrorizing anything they arbitrarily consider “bad.”

This group needs to find a cause worth protesting if they

. intend to survive, and we would strongly suggest that it needs to

learn when not to protest in a nuclear testing zone protected by
the French military.

H a l 1 ,
Pitt’s lone and

athletic facility,
now owns the

Columnlst right to demand
Sean random drug

Duncan tests from any-
one who wishes
to exercise there.

This means anyone who
likes to leisure swim, play rac-
quetball, lift weights and espe-
cially those drug-fiendin’ bas-

ketball players can be subject— ,

ed to a drug urinalysis.

Don’t get your Speedo all
bunched up, that was just a fic-
titious situation to depict the

_ puckeri-ng—anal legislature

that’s running things. Trees
Hall isn’t really testing for
drugs, but don’t be ﬂoored if
something like this happens in
the future.

' The U.S. government is
supremely paranoid of drug
use in sports. It acts like a
bugged-out, blunt-smokin’ kid
does. when he thinks some-
one’s looking at him. In fact,

the Supreme Court was so ,

wigged-out two weeks ago that
it voted 6-3 in favor of allow-
ing public schools to conduct
drug tests on student-athletes.
Umm, ever heard of the Fourth
Amendment to the
Constitution, the amendment
that prevents unreasonable
searches? The Supreme Snort
should get its noses off the
table and stick it in that ever-
so-consistent document drawn
up by those fair men a couple
centuries ago-

In 1991, James Acton, a 12-
year—old seventh grader from
Oregon, refused to take a drug
urinalysis. Consequently, he
was refused a spot on the foot-
ball team. Here's a kid, a sev-
enth grade kid may I remind

you, that had no history of
trouble, no history of drugs,
nothing. What can bemore
unreasonable than asking him
to take a drug test_? It’s like
searching a house without any
proof of wrongdoing. Acton
went to court and lost.

The particularly. amusing
part of the court’s decision is
that public schools hold the

- right to test any student-

athlete. Why is only student-
athletes that are tested? What
about all those sly-speaking
forensics teams, or the brainiac
math club how come
they’re not subject for testing?
Or what about Billy Burnout,

the notorious drug user/dealer '

of the school? Nope. They
don’t play sports, so they’re
OK. V

It’s just not logical that ath-
letes are alienated from every-
one else. The government has
been in a tailspin since basket-
ball star Len Bias died of an
drug overdose in 'l986. If I’m
not mistaken, thousands of
people die each year from drug
overdoses. But the government
chooses to put sport-s under the
microscope.

The music industry glorifies
and even encourages drug use.
Artists write music for the sole
purpose of drugs and openly
talk about drugs as a major

-influence in their work. Just a

month ago, the head singer of
Stone Temple Pilots got busted
for heroin possession. He
received a slap on the inner-
elbow with an elastic band,
took a minor fine and went on
with the completion his next
album. But he doesn’t dribble
a basketball, swing a bat or run
with a football, so it doesn’t
matter.

Drug use is omnipresent.
There’s no way of stopping it.
The trickling down of drug

vtestingyall the way to the high

school ranks is just another
Uncle Sam facade of saying to
the public, “Hey look public,
we’re not just eating Bon-Bons
and harassing secretaries,
we’re actually doing some-
thing.” Once again its facade is
transparent. - .

This is a perfect place and
time for government officials
to flex their papier—maché
muscles. Why not try to ruin
something that these kids have
worked their whole life on?
Why not stamp a “druggie”
label on a kid before he/she is
even suspected of drug use?
Sports for a lot of kids in the
inner city is a way off the
streets. It keeps them straight.
But instead they’re punished
for it. A lot of times student-
athletes are the best in the
schools —— cleanand out of
gangs, not the ones to be sin-
gled out.

But all political bullshit and
alienation aside, there
shouldn’t even be drug testing,
random or not, and especially
not on the high school level.
Testing is supposed to inject
fear in students with hope of
preventing drug use. Umm, I
have news for the government,
that ain’t going to happen. The
only things that testing will
inject is a crate full of contro-
versial court cases and a dose
of reality. There are several
ways to advocate a drug-free
society like educating kids of
the effects of drugs. Raping
someone of individual free-
doms isn’t one of them.

Sean Duncan is the Managing
Editor for The Pitt News and
will be the first person to be
drug tested at Trees Hall.

The Pitt News, Wednesday, July 12, 1995

Everyone be quiet! I'm trying to hear the noise!

My experiences are different when
it’s quiet on campus. And believe it or
not, just about any early Sunday mom-
ing the campus is as quiet as a confes-
sional to the cosmos. During the sum-
mer term, the quiet time is more pro-
longed than the typical Sunday mom-
ing, as most people took their hollering
to their horizons.

I find quiet difficult to talk about.
After all, any statement would create
sound, and quiet is an absence of sound.
An absence of sound, but yet I do hear
much new awareness.

These thoughts came to me as I
walked alone in the empty halls of the
Cathedral. However, it was difficult to
hear my thoughts over the loud, echo-
ing cadence of my footsteps. With no
one else marching, “sneakering” or
snickering, my steps reverberated loud-
er than an overused Stairmaster at a fat
farm.

‘ Speaking of farm, because of my
walk I had worked up a thirst, and I felt
like an out of shape cow. So, I stopped
at a water fountain and as my lips read-
ied to_lap, I paused. During quiet times,
water fountains sound as if Niagara
Falls is directly connected to the spigot.

The water roared up to my lips, cascad-

ed back down and then stampeded
away like wild horses. Little did I real-
ize that a water fountain can sound like
a boom box and can play a Rolling

with new frequencies.

Stones tune.

It is only during quiet times that inan- V

imate objects reveal their multiple per-
sonalities. During quiet times, quiet due
to the absence of human noise, the
inanimate objects do the “talking.”

A water fountain will often sound

machines will dispense their goodies
with gargantuan gyrations. Elevators
bounce up and down faster than a pro
basketball player. .

In a way, the objects’ serenade is
wonderful, because the melody is being
played just for me. The background
sounds that always softly play have
stepped center stage, and I can conduct
this orchestration in a quiet and quick
fashion. Yes, quick! During quiet times,
even the Cathedral elevators are fast.

But, I am also conducive to a para-
dox. I am the only one around, andno
one else hears or receives the noted ser-
vice from my inanimate friends. And if
anybody were around, the quiet
wouldn’t be, and I’d suffer “wait in
line” servitude. I'm the lone benefactor

who records the experience in my per-
sonal VCR (Viable Cognitive
Recollections).

This recording gives a twist to the old
contemplation of, “if a tree falls in the
woods and nobody is around, does it
make a sound?” The twist, “if nobody’s
around to share the campus, does the

Vending I

experience still exist?”

I believe that, yes, it does exist.
However, when a- vending machine rips
me off, elevators motor like molasses or
a fountain feebly ﬂounders, the experi-
ence is better if I share it with others. I
want to complain about that dandy dol-
lar I lost over candy. Socially swear and
cuss Gothic gore at the Cathedral eleva-
tors. Whack a water fountain into sub-
mission with other people around. Of
course, my rantings and ravings would
quickly quiet any notion that it can be
quiet around here. 7

. What, then, is the answer when it
. comes to wanting to share a quiet
moment with another person? This

question makes me believe that the
answer lies somewhere in the analogy
that quiet relates to noise as shyness
relates to sociability. The relationship is
a juxtaposed understanding. To know
quiet, I also have to know itsbrash
brother named noise. Only after living
on the “pump up the volume, get ahead,
in-your-face, I want an A” campus, am
I able to appreciate a quiet walk on

. campus.

I need both the noise and the quiet,
but I seem to appreciate both the noise
and the quiet much more when it is
quiet. I ﬂee much more frequently from
noise. Once I find a harbor that is quiet,
I almost‘ inevitably think, “gee, it is
quiet”. And with my remark, the appre-

ciation of the quiet exists only because I

am well aware of how much noise '

could exist.’ lam fully aware of the

noise that still rings in my ears and i

lingers in my memory of the place that
I left behind. ‘

Does this make sense? If not, let‘ me
put it to you this way. If you are just
stopping in for a visit during the sum-
mer before you start fall term, do you
notice the absence of theblasts, bleats
and blares that typically take your
eardrums to dangerous decibels during
the fall? Perchance, after you return

from wince thy come, will it be that the s A

first answer you’ll give to any friend or
family member that inquires, “how was
your campus visit?” you’ll reply,
“quiet.” Might you ponder that the
University of Pittsburgh’s campus is
almost bucolic during the summer
term? Could it be possible that you
would like some of the quiet to stay
when you return with the activities of
the fall? If so, you are hearing my
predicament of understanding the deli-
cate balance of quiet and noise.

I guess I can wait to talk to you about
your feelings, because for the most part
I haven’t missed you, and I am enjoying
the quiet, but it would also be nice if
you were here to hear me tell you that.

Paul’ Covaleski is a columnist for The
Pitt News.

Attention students! Major overhaul planned for Pitt...

1 have previously laid a theoretical
basis for a new university government.
I now propose how a new government
could be established and organized:

-I. There would be anamalgamation
of the SGB and CGS board into one
undergraduate house. It would be orga-
nized like' the British House of
Commons, with a nonpartisan Speaker
controlling debate. Representation
would be evenly divided among the
classes (including Superseniors, or fifth
year) and evenly divided among day
and night students. The head of the
house would be a Prime Minister.

2. The graduate groups would amal-
gamate into a graduate Senate, orga-
nized like the U.S. Senate with repre-
sentation evenly divided among the
groups. A graduate Vice—Chancellor,
elected by the graduates, would serve
as the presiding officer in the Senate.

3. The executive branch would be
comprised of two undergraduate chan-
cellors (one day and one evening)
elected popularly, the graduate Vice-
Chancellor and six Councils: the
Councils of Education, Multi-Cultural
Affairs, Justice, Finance, Labor and

- Intergovernmental Relations, each
headed by a secretary. The Education

council would deal with educational
reforms. The Multi-Cultural affairs
council would deal with racial policy.

The Justice council would deal with
judicial reform, as well as serve as
counsel to students in the judicial sys-
tem. The Finance council would print
the budget, ‘serve as an appellate board
for appropriations and ensure that it
was carried out. The Labor council
would deal with the problems of work-
ing students. Finally, the
lntergovernmental Relations council
would deal with relations between the
federal, state, city and student govem-
ments. -

4. The Chancellors would appoint the
Prime Minister and the Vice-
Chancellor the councils; councils
would be no more than five members
each. I

5. (a) The houses would be special-
ized; thus, the House would deal with

undergraduate affairs and the Senate A

with graduate affairs. However, joint
bills would be made" in the cases of
appropriation and such issues which
affect the student body as a whole.

(b) The Chancellors would have line-
item and in toto veto over undergradu-
ate bills and joint bills of appropriation;
the Vice-Chancellor would have the
same privileges‘ ‘over graduate bills;
however, line-item veto could be over-
ridden by simple majority vote and in
toto vetoes by a three-fifths majority. '

6. A Student Judicial Board would be

Voicing their opinions...

Nothing but a student

I would like to respond to recent
decisions of the University of
Pittsburgh board of trustees, as report-
ed in The Pitt News on June 28. I think
that the whole situation is absolutely
preposterous. The board of trustees
made it clear that they no longer trust

. in Dennis O’Connor, so O’Connor

resigned. That was a good move. If the
board had stopped at this point, hired a
new Chancellor and closed the case, I
would have been happy (despite the
enormous resignation package they
were going to give O’Connor.) But no,
the board has now offered our dear

departing Chancellor a tenured posi-

tion in the Biology department, com-
plete with an exorbitant salary of
$177,200. The average Pitt professor
makes only $76,300. Iask the board,
why are they so eager to keep a man
on the “team” who obviously they do
not trust? If this were a Fortune 500
corporation, no CEO would fire a man
who was not capable of doing his job,
then hire him at another position with
complete confidence and an extrava-
gant salary (especially if that corpora-
tion were on the road to bankruptcy).
Everyone here knows that there is an
image problem at Pitt; its reputation is
not great, and it is only getting worse.

Enrollment is down, salaries have V

to serve as head of this board. They
would all be elected popularly and
would interpret the Constitution. using
the power of judicial review. Thus. it
would have original jurisdiction in con-
stitutional issues and appellate jurisdic-
tion on all others. Decisionsiwould be
final unless recalled by student referen-
dum or initiative.

7. All inferior tribunals would be cre-
ated by legislation through the House
and Senate. , S .

8. The elections would be staggered:
first Judicial, then Executive, then
Legislative. Elections would be moni-
tored by an independent committee
comprised of grads and undergrads.
Complaints could be issued up to one
week after the elections and would be
reviewed by the SJB (except in such
case that an SJB election were contest-
ed, that would be reviewed by the elec-
tions c,ommittee).‘The board (or com-
mittee), if finding electoral fraud or a
violation of pre-established spending
limits, could void the results and call
for new elections.

9. All candidates for any position

would have to make a public address
on the radio or in the newspapers.
Candidates for Chancellor and Vice-

been frozen and the board has just
decided to raise tuition a whopping

4.5 percent this fall semester. What is-

wrong with thispicture? I would sug-
gest that the extra $100,900 that
O’Connor will be receiving be placed
in the budget, or be transferred into
scholarships, or put toward financial
aid to compensate for what the gov-
ernment will be cutting and the tuition
hike. I will now be paying (as an out-
of-state student) close to $20,000 a
year to attend this university. It is no
wonder enrollment is down — Pitt
does not offer its students enough ben-
efits for that kind of tuition. ’ 4

What kind of message are we send-

Chancellor would have to a) writea I

platform. b) participate in a series of
debates and c) participate in a radio
debate. The only exception to these
rules would be write—in candidates.

10. The Legislature would write a
new Student Bill of Rights after taking
office. The Bill of Rights would
include: ‘

(a) freedom of the press and of
speech;

(b) freedom of religion;

(c) rights of theaccused;

(d) freedom of expression;

(e) right to protest;

(f) right to privacy; and

(g) a‘ clause providing for “menu-

merated rights,” or those which are not
directly written but those which comply
with the spirit (if not the letter) of the
Constitution. _ p

Thus, here is my 10-PointPlan. By
no means do thelnew architects of the
democracy need to follow it, but to use
it as a framework. ‘

Finally, remember this: history does
not wait for pensivemen, only those
who seize the initiative does history
long retain and cherish.

So, all you students would desire a
more democratic than autocratic stu-

- dent government, carpe diem !

ing our students, our faculty, our
future Chancellor and the university
community around the country? By
retaining O’Connor, the board is only
making our image problem worse; in
addition, student and faculty morale is
bound to drop even more than it has
already. The board of trustees is not
doing this university a favor by “retain-
ing O’Connor, it is doing the universi-
ty a disservice. Whose interests is it

looking out for? Certainly not mine. V

But who am I anyway? Just a student.

The Farewell Concert of lene
and Vernon Palazzo
by Frank Gagliano

 Directed by Michael Montel

In mythical Bodoni County,
a couple awaits the return of

 their runaway daughter, Billie.
 She has been gone for 10
 years under mysterious cir-
 cumstances. Billie’s ‘parents,
 Irene (Broadway legend Rita
 Gardner) and Vernon Palazzo
 (jazz artist Bill Young of.Shake
 Wilder and Young), are song-
 writers composing their final
: song.

On this night, lrene seeks
reconciliation with her family
which, for whatever reason,
has grown apart. Vernon can-
not speak and uses his music
to convey his thoughts. At the
same time, lrene has an insa-
tiable need for constant sound.
These dynamics only addto
the 10-year-old stress of antic-
ipating their daughter’s return.
Despite these tensions, the
Palazzos must finish their final
song, the last verse of which
will tell the tale of the family's
reunion — or of their perma-
nent estrangement.

Longtime playwright Frank
Gagliano engages the musical
talents of Young, a jazz artist
from New York, on the piano.
Young adds to the theatrical
concert by combining his own
improvisation-heavy style with
Gagliano’s lyrics. Gardener, a
Broadway veteran and legend,

narrates the story through the
song and monologues of the
character of lrene.

in the play, the Palazzos use
songwriting as an attempt to
reconcile their past conflicts.
“These people are coming to
grips with their lives and are
waiting for the resolution to
surface in their musical com-
position,” said Gagliano. The
musical element in this perfor-
mance is utilized to portray the
relationships among the char-
acters. The couple depends
on this music not only to com-
municate the circumstances
behind their daughter’s disap-
pearance to the audience, but
to communicate between
themselves as well. lrene’s
need for constant sound com-
pels Vernon to continuously
play the piano to abate her
needs. These elements pin-
point the play’s main focus
and direction.

The concert-p/ay is part of
Carnegie Mel/on’s Summer
Showcase of plays and is
showing July 14th and 15th
with a matinee on the 16th.
This compilation oftalent is
only $.99 two hours before the
performance and is followed
by a reception free to all audi-
ence members.

As inexperienced as Mario is

as clueless talking ‘bout love.
What’s a postman to do? What

here the film offers the most

Try telling that to Oakland A’s
slugger Mark McGwire. He has
to watch the game on television,
because doctors feel “the ﬂight

ager Tony LaRussa.

McGwire, who is tied for the
major league lead with 24 home
runs, was hit in the head by a -
David Cone fastball in the ﬁrst
game of an A’s-Kansas City

Saturday. This event caused a
series of retaliation pitches by
A’s hurlers and then their ejec- _
tions.

Cone _wasn’t even warned for
hitting McGwire, but Oakland’s
Doug Johns was immediately
ejected for throwing behind the
Jays’ John Olerud. Then the A’s
Mike Harkey was ejected after
hitting Joe Carter in the knee.

The question has been asked
so many times it’s getting
redundant: “How should pitch-
ers who throw at a batter be dis-
cip1ined?”

When tossing a pitcher out of
the game for throwing at a bat-
ter, the umpires are making a
decision based on pure judge:
ment. It is impossible for any-
one to know the pitcher’s
thoughts, like if he intentionally
threw at the batter, except the
pitcher.

There’s also the possibility
that “the ball got away.”

Piﬂ   lracksier faces life's   next hurdle

By Lisa Tolbert
For The Pitt News

Wes Alexander, former Pitt All-American hurdler, is
moving on to his next big race —— the working world.
Alexander currently works full-time as a counselor spe-
cialist at The Academy on the South Side. He teaches
English composition and public speaking.

Alexander graduated from Pitt in April

and feels proud to hold his degree.

“It’s the best feeling in the world,” he
said. “I only took eight semesters. I got it

done as quickly as possible.”

Alexander graduated with a Bachelor 0
Arts degree in communications and finished

with a 3.65 grade point average.

Alexander said he will miss his track
career and that he does have some desire t
coach in the future, possibly at Alleghen

His experience in track dates back to mid

goals at Pitt as far as track is concerned.

“I wasn‘t a prize recruit, but I came her

won the Big East, sol really can’t com

plain.”

Alexander, who is the Big East champion =
in the 400-meter hurdles and ranks second '

It’s just a reminder that if

Gordon That’s OK, you’re saying.
Who needs the Pirates?
They’re just a bunch of no—name scrubs
who are just a half—game out of the base-
ment. Well, Pittsburgh needs the Pirates.
Pittsburghers have been telling me ever
since I came to Pitt that this is a major
-league city, a growing metropolis of arts
and entertainment. _We’re not just a drink-
ing, football, ex—steel town which jumps on
the bandwagon when a team gets good,
they say.
If that’s true, prove it. Go to a Pirate

game. This city will be taking an enormous

  
  
  
 

step backwards if the Buccos take off. Go
to a Pirates game, even though the team
stinks. Go when they are playing the
Rockies or the Braves and check out some
All-Stars, like Dante Bichette or Fred
McGriff.

And if you go to a Pirate game it’s a
pretty cheap date. Friday nights are half-off
night_for college students. That’s five
bucks for two seats and throw in another
$15 and you get a couple of beers. Also, if
you save your ticket stub you can get a free
slurpee at 7-11. '

If you don’t know how bad the Pirates’
situation is, let me fiH you in. The Pirates
are having major league financial troubles.
Last week they had to borrow $11 million
from banks to cover costs. The team might
be sold and move to a city that would sup-
port the ballclub. Attendance at games is
awful, and that point was glorified in this
week’s Sports Illustrated in which there
was a picture of a section of Three Rivers
Stadium with just one fan.

Some people say nobody goes to games

because the stadium stinks and is outdated.
But building a new Camden Yards-type
stadium would only be a temporary band-
aid and after the novelty wore off the atten-
dance would likely shrink again.

Another explanation for the poor atten-
dance numbers is that nauseating garbage
about people boycotting the game because
of greedy owners and players. The heck
with that — it’s just a game, a sport, a form
of entertainment. Leave all that off-the-
ﬁeld-stuff exactly where it belongs — off
the field.

It really deﬁes logic to not go to games
because the players are greedy or overpaid.
Are you going to boycott Jim Carrey’s next
movie because he’s going to get $20 mil-
lion? That is seriously overpaid. Or how
about spending $15 on an REM CD and
then $40 on tickets to a concert?

Baseball is a game but it is also a busi-
ness, and like every other business in the
world there are people who are underpaid

and peoplewho are overpaid. That

away from the umpires when dealing
with shots to the dome. Set some new
guidelines to follow. ‘

John Hickey, a writer for the Oakland
(Calif) Tribune, gave his solution: When
a batter is hit in the head, the pitcher
should automatically be given a three-
week suspension without pay. In effect,
about three starts would be missed.

The second time the pitcher hits a bat-
ter in the head, he should get a three-
month suspension.

Then the third time, he should sit out
for a year.

This may seem a little drastic, but is it
really? .,

If a pitcher is faced with losing pay-
checks for three months, he will be less
likely to intentionally headhunt.

Granted, there is a difference between
getting hit in the leg and getting hit in the
head. When a batter is hit below the
neck, leave the decision up to the umpire,
but when it’s above the neck, make it
automatic, whether the pitch got away or
not.

We all know how much more con-
cerned everybody is when dealing with
the word “concussion,” namely in the
NFL and boxing.

That’s why a suspension this severe
may not be so bad.

Pitchers will stick up for themselves by
saying that they are establishing their
strike zone, or they’re backing the batter
off the plate, or even protecting their own
teammates who may have been thrown
at.

There’s no need to do it by potentially
damaging somebody’s thought capacity
for the rest of their life.

What could be done in college to pre-
vent this? -

_ That’s a much more difficult call to
make, because there is no money to be
taken away from the pitcher. (At least
there shouldn’t be.)

Last season, Pitt’s leadoff man, Josh
Mellor, set a newschool and NCAA
record by being hit 23 times.

Once he was hit four times in one

There’s plenty of reasons you should go

to a Pirate game, but basically I shouldn’t
’ be telling you about them. it’s pretty
pathetic that a sports columnist for a col-
lege newspaper, or a columnist for any

.  newspaper, such as Bruce Keidan, should
I‘ be writing a column to save the Pirates.
Go ahead, stay home. Don’t go out to
 Three Rivers for a game. But two years

game. None of the pitchers were thrown
out or even warned.

So, the NCAA should adopt the same
guidelines as Major League Baseball. It
should be an automatic ejection after hit-
ting a batter in the head. If it’s not in the
head, leave that up to the umpire.

In any event, some steps shouldbe
taken to dissuade pitchers from head-
hunting in both the majors and college.
