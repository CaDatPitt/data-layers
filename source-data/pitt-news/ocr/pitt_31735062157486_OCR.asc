Band to Present Its Own Story

"During. Half-Time Tomorrow  

Fans at the Panther-Marquette clash tomorrow will wit-
ness a strlkiiig contrast during the Pitt Band performance at
half-time. They will see the origination and progress of the
varsity band by -way of 1_1‘1llSlC and formations. ' V
_ In the presentation, -“The Evolution of the College Band,”
the marching inusicians twill: display how its highly touted

band grew from a11 old style /22-piece ‘corps to a streamlined

120-piece organization.

After the half~t_in1e whistleiblows, the ba.nd will move onto

the ﬁeld playing “On to Victory.” 1*

A portion will then fall out and
form a 22 piece musical. unit.‘ This
group. will represent the typical
college band about 35 years ago.
Includes Old Routines

The roaring twenties will be de-
picted by a 34—piece outﬁt. On the
down beat, Drum Major Robert
Andrews will lead them into a
“W” where it will be conducted
in an old fashioned manner to the
music of “Buckle Down Winsocki.”

In the third step of the evolu-
tion, the entire band consolidate
and form the numerals “48.” Two
numbers played at-previous games
during the current season will
portray the present trend of ar-

ranging music and formations
especially for stadium produc-
tions.

Two Modern Numbers

“I‘m An Old Cowhand” will be
speciﬁcally arranged for this
routine. Sam Quigley, chief ar-
ranger of the Pitt Band, will cou-
ple it with modern harmony. The
other song will be the “Anvil
Chorus” in Glenn Miller style.

The ﬁnal formation of the series
will be a tribute to the memory of
the late Mr. E. V." Babicock, bene-
factor of the University band
from 1912 until his death in Sep-
tember of this year.

Reproductionof the Phttern pre-
sented in Mr. Babcock’s honor on
Sept. 21, 1946 will be made.

On that Occasion, the band was
using for “the first time its new
gold—matched instruments pro-
vided by Mr. Babcock. One of his
favorite numbers, “Beautiful
Dreamer,” willbe _ played as ‘it
was arranged in 1946.

Wooden Posts
il Supsant
llotory Loot

Students celebrating future grid
victories will have to be satisﬁed
with tearing down wooden goal-
posts according to Frank Carver,
Pitt athletic director.

Citing the expense of replacing
the metal posts torn down in the
disturbance following last Satur-
day’s game, Mr. Carver added that
he had no desire to see such po-
tentially dangerous situations oc-
cur again.

. Commenting on the unconven-
tional procedure of Pitt students
tearing down their own goalposts,
both in this instance and in the
celebration following last year’s
Ohio State game, Carver said, ‘‘I
think ifs poor taste, and ’I can’t
see the school spirit behind such
action. I’m puzzled by the psy-
chology. of the Pitt student body.”

Mr. Carver explained that the
policemen who attempted to keep
the students from the goalposts
last Saturday were hired by the
University to protect school prop-
erty and added that-in the future
police will stay off the ﬁeld after
the games until .“the student body
decides it wants its property pro-

 

tected.”

As yet no complaints have been
received by the dean of men’s
ofﬁce or the athletic office from
any individual involved but some

participants are known to have

been injured.

Lt. John J. Joyce, oﬁicer in
chargegof the -Stadium police on
Saturday, was unavailable for
comment. V ‘

Monday to succeed Pat Seger, who
resigned at the beginning of the
semester.

J oanne’s participation in class
government during her three years
here was the decisive factor in her
appointment,

A member of Cwens during her
sophomore, Joanne also served on
her class cabinet. She is a mem-

arqasette ls I
Underdog in
Stadium Illt

By BOB VAN ATTA

For the ﬁrst time since October,
1945, Pitt’s Panthers rnay ﬁnd
themselves with a two ‘game win-
ning streak. The hitch in such
rare optimism is that Mike Milli-
gan’s charges must subdue Mar-
quette tomorrow afternoon at the
Stadium. A crowd of 20,000 is ex-
pected.

Kickoff time at 2 p. m. will ﬁnd
3,500 high school fans from 55
district schools observing High
School Day.

For the second straight week,
the home Pitts are slight favorites.
A victory over Frank J. Murray's
Hilltoppers not only would initi-
ate the ﬁrst winning streak in
three years, but also would ex-
ceed the ’47 victory total of one.

In 1945, ill-fated Clark Shaugh-
nessy’s last Panther eleven
bounced West Virginia, 20-0, and
be—bopped Bucknell, 38-0, in the
second and third games of the sea-
son.

 

Opponent-s Parallel

Strikingly parallel circumstances
surround tomorrow’s Stadium op-
ponents. Each lost their ﬁrst two
games before coming out on top
last week. Pitt topped West Vir-
ginia, 16-6, and Marquette victim-
ized St. Louis, 47-7.

Both present veteran arrays for-
tiﬁed by outstanding sophomores.
Eight Marquette players partici-
pated in the 7-6 Pitt victory of
two years ago, the only previous
meeting between the two. Five
Pitt starters are holdovers from
that game.

Keynoting the revived Panther
attack is Bimbo Cecconi. The lit-
tle Donora junior is 20th in the
nation in total offense, and most
of those who lead him have the
bulge of an extra game.

Pitt Has Air Edge

Jimmy Joe Robinson’s climax
running, stilled last week, may
furnish the rushing thrills as Cec-
coni, Bobby Lee, and Lindy Lauro
heave the oval.

Spearheading the T—offense of
the visiting Hilltoppers are quar-
terbacks Frank Volm, a sopho-
more, and veteran Bill Hickey
among the passers, and halibacks
Joe Gagliardo, Lorry Plate, and
Jerry Hiller in actual ball’:toting.

Marquette’s air attack “has not
been nearly as impressive as Pitt’s.
The Panther accent on'air travel
has resulted in 41% eﬁiciency as
against 36% for the Hilltoppers.

Converse g r o u n d "eﬂiciency
means little because of lesser op-
position to Marquette rushing ef-
forts. Whether Murray will try
to capitalize more on weak
Panther pass defense remains to
be seen.

Barkouskie Back

Two of the midwest’s best punt-
ers, ever—reliable in Bill Hardisty
and fullback Dick Melka of the
Milwaukee eleven will add the
often forgotten kicking touch.

.Guard Bernie Barkouskie has
regained the starting role at left
guard in Milligan’s lone lineup
change. The Kulpmont junior’s
ankle, which hampered him ear-
lier, is better.

Pitt's casualty list now consists
of Tackles Wib Forsythe, Ralph

LET THEM STAND

There may not be a right and a wrong way of ‘tearing
down goalposts but it seems that there is a right and a wrong
time for doing it. Athletic Director Frank Carver and’ a
number of other people" are of the op,inion that last Saturday
was the wrong time. Also the wrong place. '

The idea behind tearing down goalpos'ts is to rub your vic-
tory in. To do that you must topple your opponents’ posts.
In the light of those two points we’ll have to admit that'Mr.
Carver is right and that the goalpostt felling after the “Test
_Virgi11ia game was pointlhss. It was, as one man put it, like
celebrating cby throwing rocks _through your own windows.

Mr. Carver isn’t angry, you understand, just a little puzzled
--and justly so. In the ﬁrst place the victory overjthe Moun-
taineers wasn’t of such importance as to warrant any such dem-
onstration. Not, at least, at the expense of our own goalposts.

4 For those" who still.feel that every victory, even those
at home, must be celebrated by carrying ._,“away the stadium

, ﬁxtures, Mr. Carver is making the task _a little easier.

 

 There won’t be any steel posts to contend with. Orany
 ‘policemen either. Instead :there’ll be plain, unpainted, unguard-
“ed, pine boards. That way the University will save “ $100 a
week, and the students won’t have to. worry about incurring

bruises at the hands of overzealous bluecoats.
But we/hope that the students don ’t take the wooden post.s
a.nd the absence of police as an invitation to repeat last week’s

performance. The fact that the posts are no longer steel'does-

not mean that it will be any less pointless to tear them down
after the game.

Like demonstrations on Monday, the matter, of the goal-
posts is one of common sense. There are much better and more
effective means of showing school spirit than such senseless, and
bad-mannered demonstrations. V '

Sense—L;es

By LES GALLAGHER

No names please, was to have
been thb policy of this-column,
but something bigger than the
both of us has heaved that policy
windoward. In this issue I wish

 _ to congratulate Stu Workmaster,

Bob Dompka, Ed Tucker,~Larry
Johnson, Sam Caldwell, and his
unidentiﬁed friend, also Don Gal-
lagher (my brother, a devil-may-
care type) plus Harry Neugebauer
and ‘the .24 other persons who
made up the gallant little band of
32 students.

Riff and Raff ‘

This was the small gang of
urchins who swept down onto the
ﬁeld at the beginning of the sec-
ond half_at last Saturday’s foot-
ball game. This was the ill-dressed

little contingent which you saw‘

arrange themselves on either side

 A of the Pitt ‘tunnel. Noble, unspir—

ited, students these were the 32
riff and raif who unlike yourself
were not just cheering another
football team, they were down on

:1‘. that ﬁeld to welcome out of that

locker room the Golden Panthers
of the University of Pitsburgh.
For a -few. minutesthere, it was
the old days. And once again as
the Alma ~Mater died out over the
saucered walls of the stadium, a
winning Pitt team roared out of
the tunnel onto the cleat-clipped
turf between the welcoming lines
of a gone crazy student body."

This Vagabond bunch actually
left their seats for the sole, pur-
pose of going down on the moist
playing surface and giving; the
players a ﬁrst-hand cheer and 'a-
clap on_the back.

. Hunt the Witches

Students of Pitt arise! This peas-
ant—like attitude must be abolish-

 Publicdemonstrations of ath-

letic enthusiasm must be dealt
with harshly. These 32 moral and
mental degenerates must be hunt-
ed‘ out. We ‘know the.na_mes of
their leaders; ,exter,rn_i_nate‘ the
originators and wehave killed the
idea. . Capture, these witches and
their black-arted cheering shall
cease. Publicly ﬂog. them ,. and
exile these warped minds to Car-
negie Tech, the madhouse where-
after losingnineteen straight, they
still cheer.

And now for the story behind
the story, or what caused this
sheer folly of the aforementioned
32. As the ﬁrst half ended and the
bands prepared to do what they
had prepared to do, someone in
the stands feels that cheering fee-
bly from his elevated spot isn"t
sufficient to show his real enthu-
siasm whenthe home team is lead-
ing l4 to 0. ‘So he circulates the
word, “come down on the ﬁeld\and
lead the team back on.” One of
his cohorts, Johnson by name, a
boy with an eye for a practical
problem, arranges it with the
guard to’ allow the students on
the ﬁeld. The guard said, “I will
permit the ehtrance of 100 stu-

dents!’ .

Where Was"'I'he Mob

Then four minutes before the
team was due out of the locker
room, the cry rallied in the throats
of the valiant 32, “let’s form a vic-
tory—arch.” They swept from
their seats, they vaulted the stone
abutments, like the screaming
banshees of hell they loosed them-
selves from the staid aristocracy
to greet the team. The guard
braced himself for the avalanche
of thousands but after the ﬁrst
wild wave of the leading 8, 24
more people trickled down onto
the ﬁeld to form a scraggly, hole-
blotched victory line.

University of Pittsburgh student
body, you paid your team a "great
tribute. True, most of you didn’t
know abo"ut"the v-arch at half
time but for those who did and
still stayed glued to the seat . . ,.
well, for you I spit on the ground.

Thiiadeiphia Story‘ Reaches

Advanced Sta

ge n Reine 

rsals

 

Rehearsals by the Pitt Players are well advanced for their forth-

coming stage production, “The Philadelphia Story.”

The Philip

Barry comedy opens the Pitt drama season October 22.
Harvey J. Pope, director of the dramatic group, has selected a
cast of veteran Pitt Players to stage this humorous drama in Pitts-

burgh for the first time.

When the Theater ‘Guild produced the play in New York city,

Katherine Hepburn, Joseph Cot—¢

ton, and Van Heﬂin catapulted it
to a top—rank hit. The comedy re-
mained a Broadway smash per-
formance for more than a year,
and its Hollywood version won
the Oscar award.

Rave reviews followed the
Broadway opening. The New York
Times critic described it as fol-
lows: “Philip Barry abandons his
stern probing__ among absolute
values in ‘The Philadelphia Story’
and contents himself with polish-
ing an anecdote to high luster.
Alert and sauve is his comedy.

“His chief character is a spir-
ited girl of an old Philadelphia
family whose only fault is a cer-
tain inclination to put humanity
on a pedestal. She is lovely and
witty but will not take life easily.”

Martha Morrison will handle
this role, Tracy Lord, which Kath-
erine Hepburn played on Broad-
way. In the story the somewhat
priggish girl learns the true facts
of life from a muck-racking jour-
nalist, Mike Conner. Melvin Sil-
ver takes this part in the local
showing.

Fresh Dance

Jobs Open

Applications for the Freshman
Dance Committee are now being
accepted by the Student Congress
appointments committee. Although
the dance is scheduled for Friday,
February 18, 1949, Congress feels
the committee should have plenty

of time to choose the proper peo-

ple.

Freshmen applying should re-
member that the originality of
their proposed dancweiitheme, a well
investigated and ‘planned budget,
and clever ideas will be the basis
of selecting the committee. Aside
from these factors, the interview
with the appointments committee
counts heavily when the ﬁnal de-
cision for the committee is made.

Positions open are: chairman,
business manager, publicity chair-
man, ticket chairman and decora-
tions chairman.

Applicants are advised that help
in ﬁlling out the application
blanks can be had from upper-
classmen who have worked on
dance committees in other years.

of products from brush bristles to
surgical sutures.

Nylon owes its origin to a Du Pont
fundamental research project begun
in 1928. A group of scientists set out
to ﬁnd out how and why the mole-
cules of certain substances polymer-
ized to form giant chainlike mole-
cules. Hope of obtaining a new com-
mercial ﬁber was ﬁrst aroused when,
two years later, a polymer was de-
veloped which could be drawn out
into a thin strand, like taffy candy.
The complex problems which fol-
lowed called for the services of over
200 Du Pont men and women, among
whom were some of America’s most
competent scientists and engineers.

ResecIrch—a Major Du Pont Aclivily

Nylon is an excellent example of
modern research at work at Du Pont.
Young scientists joining the organi-
zation now may share in other dis-
coveries of outstanding importance.
They may ﬁnd opportunities in such
challenging ﬁelds as ﬁnishes, coated
fabrics and various ﬁbers; synthetic
organic chemicals, including ﬁne
 chemicals; synthetic rubber; electro
. and agricultural chemicals; plastics;

pigments and photographic ﬁlm; and

high pressure synthesis.

Each of ten manufacturing depart-
ments of Du Pont has its own staff
and is operated much like a separate
company. Within each,

‘men work in groups small enough
to bring quick recognition of indi-
vidual talent and capabilities.

Year after year, young, Eiquiring
minds come from leading U.S. schools
of science and engineering to Du Pont

No Mere Time-Telling Device
Dial E ,

is Foster ‘Memorial Sun

By BERNICE RIVIJIN
There is more behind a shadow

.than the surface it is cast upon.

This holds true especially for
the shadow of a sun dial on a
cement. pedestal at the side of
Stephen Foster Memorial.

On your way to a lecture some
day stop and look at this small
monument whose history dates
back to the War of 1812.

The sun dial originally stood in
front of Phipps Conservatory. If
you look closely at the ridge of
the dial you will see this smudg-
ed inscription:. “Erected in May
1914 by the Dolly Madison Chap-
ter, U.S-. Daughters of 1812.” At
the top of the dial the dedication
reads, “Dedicated to the Pitts-
burgh B_lues War of l812.”

The Daughters of the War of
1812, an organization still in ex-

.istence, erected this sun dial in

Schenley Park in honor of a
Pittsburgh regiment that fought
in the principal battles of that
war. ' .

Several years later one of the
Daughters passed- by the Con-
servatory "and noticed that the’
pointer of the sun dial had been
knocked off. Without legal author-
ization, the sun dial had been re-
moved from the pedestal and put’
in the Greenhouse at the Con_-
servatory. ‘ ._

Mrs. J. W.,Marsh, a member 0
the Daughters of the War of 1812,
found the sun dial and kept it in
her home. Since the city no long-
er appeared to be interested in
the, monument, the Daughters
sought a new home for .it

The University of Pittsgurgh
eagerly oﬁered to build a new
pedestal for the sun dial. They
joined with the Foster Hall Com-
mittee and erected a new monu-
ment where the sun ‘ dial now
stands. The committee chose this
location in honor of Stephen Fos-
ter’s father, veteran of the War

This great squad would in-

Seidel and Quatse; Guards “Red”

’,Often Ring Out for Students

 _ Nearly every student is acquainted in some way with the Heinz
Chapel services held during the week such as the Vesper and regular’
‘Sunday services. sHowever, not everyone knows that weddings are

constantly being performed’ in thee

. Tn an informal discussion last
_:_ue_sday, Dr. Raymond  Brittain,
§c{l_fo,handles services at the Chap-
i=:l';"“e’,xplained the use of the Chapel
 weddings.

. ?-If a_‘p_erson graduated from Pitt
or had some member of his imme-
‘gliate family connected in some
way" with the University, he is
gligible to be married in Heinz
Chapel. There are some rules gov-
ejfning'marriages, the most impor-
 being that the person’s church
permit his marriage in the Chapel,

 There are usually three or four

the University chaplain or a rep-
resentative of the local churches._
The number of weddings increases
between semesters as at gradua-
tion or the end of summer school.

More information on this sub-
ject can be had at Dr. Brittain’-s’
office, 2901 C1. or at the office of‘.

Atomic Safety Glass

Disco‘/ered

The discovery of a new type

‘in*PiH' Lalo

of ‘glass improving the absorptioni

of harmful radiations without discoloration has been announced by

Dr. Alexander Silverman, head
Ekperimentation was
at Pitt.

Co—workers on the project were
Dr. Joseph J. Rothermel of the
research department of Corning

.Glass Works, a former Buhl Foun-

dation Fellow at Pitt, and Dr.
Kuan Nan Sun Wfo of the West-
inghouse Electric Corporation Re-
search Laboratories.

This discovery culminates a
year and at half of research which
was carried on in the department

_of chemistry. . e

'The three co—workers stated
that the new glass will be useful
in radiation observation. It is a
lead glass containing over 20 per-
cent tungsten, giving it an absorp-
tion eﬁficiency of 50 percent great-
er than the glass now used.*

It was also pointed out that the
glass will not turn black or brown
during exposure‘ to radiation thus

making the work of the technician,

easier. ‘

Another outstanding feature of ‘

the glass is the protection it af-
ifords the worker, reducing the
of burns from deadly
gamma rays. '

Oldest man on the Pitt grid
squad is 28-year-old sophomore
end Harry Hollihan of Glenshaw.
