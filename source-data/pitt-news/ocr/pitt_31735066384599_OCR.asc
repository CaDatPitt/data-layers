Blast Levels UMW Office in Second Va. Dynamiting

By The Associated Press

ST. CHARLES, Va.—A dynamite blast wrecked a United
Mine Workers District 28 ﬁeld ofﬁce here yesterday in what
a UMW ofﬁcial said might have been the result of a bounty
for the job.

No injuries were reported in the blast, which occurred
between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. on the eve of union miners’ return
to work after a nationwide strike that began Dec. 6.

It was the second dynamiting in the southwestern Virginia
Coalﬁelds over the weekend. '

Virginia State Police reported Saturday that more than
$1 million worth of mining equipment was destroyed by
dynamite at the M&O Construction strip mine in Russell
County. That blast, in which there were no injuries,

occurred sometime Friday night, police said.

Arvill Sykes, a District 28 member of the UMW’s
International Executive Committee, said it appeared that
dynamite had been lowered between the trailer and an
adjacent union hall.

‘‘It was pretty well known a bounty was put out for
anybody that would burn it or blow it up,” Sykes said.

“Some people thought the UMW was weak in this area
until they saw that trailer come in last November.”

He refused to say who might have put out a bounty for the
trailer’s destruction.

Sykes said the trailer was paid for by ﬁve locals that

shared the union hall here and was installed last November.

George Ramey, one of four UMW ﬁeld representatives
and the head of the largest sub-district in Virginia’s coal
country had used the trailer as his ofﬁce.

Sykes said he understood the locals would pay to have the
trailer replaced.

Ramey said he lost about 30 union grievance cases in the
blast but couldn’t tell what else was missing about mid-day
yesterday.

The blast blew a 6-foot-square hole in the wall of the union
hall at ground level and blew out one end of the trailer,
causing severe structural damage.

Are Pitt Students as Apathetic As They Seem?

Italian Prog.

Poll Shows Most
Are, Politically‘

By JIM MORRISON

Pitt News Staff Writer

Considering the much-touted
budget crisis that has Univer-
sity representatives shuttling
back and forth to Harrisburg,
you would think students’
political awareness would be
high.

Think again.

In an informal Pitt News
survey taken last week——less
than two months before the
ﬁeld of 10 major state guber-
natorial candidates will be
narrowed to two-33 of 100
participating students could not
name even one of the conten-
ders._ ‘

And, in a year when every
member of the Pennsylvania
General Assembly is up for
reelection, less than half of the
students responding said they
would vote in the May primary
elections.

Fifty-two students said they

“either haven’t bothered to
register or are registered but
not interested enough to vote.

Responses ranged from “It

‘ doesn’t seem to do any good,”
f to ‘‘They’re all corrupt,” and

“It’s a hopeless effort.”

Futher evidence of student
apathy was apparent last week
when a two-day campus regis-
tration drive produced only 108
new voters.

A recent poll suggested most students here are apathetic
toward politics, revealing that 33 out of 100 participants
could not name a gubenatorial candidate in the up-
Students didn’t appear to be

coming primaries.

Senior Mark McKillup, chief
orchestrator of Pitt’s student
lobbying and chairman of the
Student Government Board’s
Committee on Government and
Public Relations was not
surprised at the results of the
survey and the registration
drive.

“The situation is not getting
any better or any worse,”
McKillup said. “For me, it’s
been a couple of years of
frustration. ’ ’

A “At times Ithink the students
get what they deserve. I’m
amazed we haven’t gone
under,” he continued.

“Students have the potential
of being a major political force,
McKillup said. “But lobbying
takes three things—money,
expertise and manpower. "We

certainly don’t have the money
or manpower, so expertise is
the only way.”

‘ ‘If students remain apathetic
not even knowing the names of
their representatives, we have
to rely on 35 to 40 people to go to
the capital and do the work, ’ ’ he
added.

McKillup did express some
optimism, however. “Pitt’s
approach to lobbying has
become one of practical politics.

Our efforts are better than the
efforts of all the other
state-related schools com-
bined,” he said.

McKillup explained Lincoln,
Penn State and Temple “have
not taken the practical approach
of developing expertise” and
“catching the legislators off
guard.”

 

apathetic last fall, however, several hundred converged
on the Capitol steps (above) to call for more state funds to
their schools, including Pitt.

“The legislators know the
trends; they know the students
don’t care. But they also know
the anti-tax lobby is a strong
and informed one. That’s why
we have these appropriations
problems,” he said.

“We have to put on a good
show for the legislature, and
show them that we are
informed,’ ’ he continued. ‘ ‘But
it’s very rare that students have
right kindof expertise. And it
doesn’t take much, maybe ﬁve
minutes a day, to know what’s
going on.”

But, in light of the last week’s
survey and the fact that many
students are not registered to
vote it looks as if apathy will
linger and legislators can
continue to ignore student

' lobbying efforts.

Modified By
CAS Council

By SHARON CHERNICK

The College of Arts and Sciences
Council has approved a proposal to
modify the Italian undergraduate
program.

The proposal passed 7-0 at last
week’s CAS meeting.

The proposal, presented by
professor, Walter Albert and Tibeor
Wlassics, calls for a basic
condensation of courses that would
enable two professors to staff the
undergraduate program in lieu of
three.

Albert and Wlassics have been
teaching the program with the help
of a part-time staff, but told Council
a major program should not hinge
on a temporary staff.

Speciﬁc changes include the
elimination of Italian 3, 4, 30, 31, 55
and 56, and the addition of Italian 5,
60, 61, 80 and 81. The emphasis of
the courses will center on Italian
literature and history.

Wlassics said a change in the
current program is necessary

-because of changing enrollment in

the department- that saw the
enrollment of more students
qualiﬁed in speaking Italian.

He also cited the adminstration’s
decision not to allow the department
to replace its full-time professors.

CAS Dean Robert Marshall said
the revised program would probab-
ly go into effect this September.

 

State Prisoners Bring In The ‘Goods’ to $13 Million Tune

By The Associated Press *

PHILADELPHIA——-The clothing may never
make the pages of Vogue and the furniture
isn’t grandmother’s Chippendale, but the
goods produced in Pennsylvania prison shops
are bringing in millions.

Sales on items made by the 1,600 convicts
employed in the ,state’s prison industries
program topped $13 million last year, prison
ofﬁcial said.

The workers comprise about 20 percent of all
state prisoners, and the goods include
everything from hose, soap and detergents to
loafer-style shoes, aprons and ground coffee.

“It’s a goodjob. I’m making enough to send
my 5-year-old daughter to a private school.
And I’m learning something that may get me a
job when I get out of here,” said Graterford
Prison inmate Cornelius Miller, as he stitched
together a pair of jockey shorts.

PenCor is the name under which 700
different prison items are marketed. The
goods include the towels and shoes made at
Graterford, the metal road signs and license
plates produced at Pittsburgh, the fenders
prisoners straighten and repaint at Dallas, and
the ground coffee and desks turned out at
Camp Hill.

PenCor guarantees the quality of all its
products and the prices are hard to beat.
Coffee, for example, sells for $2.67 a pound;
loafers for $13.95 a pair.

The general public, however, can’t snap up
any of these bargains because it is prohibited
by state law. PenCor can sell and deliver to
only federal, state, county and municipal
agencies, tax-suppoted hospitals and schools
and charitable institutions.

Inmates employed by PenCor earn at least 29
cents an hour, but they can make up to 79 cents

with bonuses for production. The average
wage is about $40, tax-free, a month. A few
men can earn about $100.

Most prison shops have waiting lists since
routine prison maintenance jobs usually pay
about 10 cents an hour.

Edwin A. Harmon, who heads the PenCor
operation, said productivity is only about 10
percent what it is outside. For example, he
said, it required 53,000 manhours to tend a
herd of 200 cows with calves at Rockview,
compared to the standard 1,400 hours.

‘‘If a man's slowing down a garment line, the
counselor argues to leave him there. At least
he’s doing something useful. But not all men
take instruction well,” Harmon said. He also
mentioned that productivity suffered because
of outmoded equipment.

Currently, inmates at Dallas are'making
ﬁreproof, ﬁberglass mattresses.

Fruits of Ignorance

Two people out of one hundred surveyed in a Pitt News straw
poll could name six of the ten gubernatorial candidates in the up-\
coming Pennsylvania primary elections. Of the same 100, 52 do

not plan to vote in the primaries.

Seventy-two percent of the United States public admits they are
very poorly informed about state politics. Ask any average Univer-
sity class who their state assemblymen and state senators are, and
the sorry response shows the high level of ignorance about the-

Pennsylvania political arena.

When the state politicians are the decision makers who allocate
funds to support Pitt, Pitt students should be more concerned
about the men who represent them in Harrisburg. They should ac-
tively seek to find how these men are voting on the floor of the
General Assembly and State Senate. After all, these men, by their
support of or opposition to allocation increases for Pitt, decide
how much tuition Pitt students pay.

Overflowing support for allocation increases for higher
education in Pennsylvania has not been forthcoming in recent
years. Pitt and other state-related schools have had to battle tooth

and nail to keep their allocations from shrinking.

Today,

legislators that students can defeat consider Pitt’s budgetary
demands secondary, listing requests for funds from the University

as “non-preferred.” --

Certainly students must worry about studying, grades and

main-

taining some social lifeﬂaﬁngd cannot'iminerse themselves in politics.
. But whenlegislamts ‘threaten to unfairly overtax students’ pocket-

‘~"”"“b"o’o’l§"and undermine the quality of education they receive by un-

j derfinancing Pitt, it is time for students to become involved on the

political system.

Until students begin following the happenings in Harrisburg and
pressuring their elected representatives to support increased fund-
ing for higher education, they will be continually be abused. If
students remain complacent in the face of legislators’ flagrant
callousness, the descendants of Milton Shapp and the herd of
Pennsylvania legislators can rest easy as they stomp on us.

Letters to the Editor

Slovak Wants St. Stah ’sDay From Carter

_ Dear Sir, Mr. President,’ IJC,

' Jim:

Let’s get to the point! As another
St. Patrick's Day has just passed, I
regret my ever having voted for
you. I assumed a vote for Carter
was a votefor equality. -Boy, was I
wrong! Sure, I bet_ you were very
happy to celebrate your nation-
ality’s holiday but we Slavic-
Americans are left “up the lake
without a paddle.” I’m sorry, but I
assumed you were Irish since your
brother Billy likes beer so much.

«done for this country

How’s that for stereotyping! Just
ask you chief aide in defense
Zbigniew Brezenski, the last time
this so-called land of the free
celebrated a St Stanley’s Day or
better yet, St. Stah!

Equality? Ha! And just look at
what the Poles and Slovaks have
in the
past...Why, just being the butt in
all of those stupid jokes those Irish
and Italian kids tell shows how
much we deserve a holiday.
Believe-you-me, those jokes really

get on our nerves...like the one
about “What do they call a pretty
girl in Poland?”—“A tourist.”

Well, we're not laughing, Mr.
Carter, sir! Perhaps, you can do
something right for a change and
make April 1 a National Day of
Celebration for those Americans
out there with Eastern European
backgrounds. Hunkies of the world
unite, you’ve got nothing to lose
but your “skis.”

Opinion

By MARIE L. WEPRICH

Three years ago—the spring of

N~I97S--—I ﬁnished my freshman year

a

Ernmnaws M ~:v . .

of college,"'“a:cted- . in V my first
full-scale theater productiomfell in
love my second time and was raped
for my first, and only, time.

Three weeks ago-—March first-—I
read in Fifth Avenue Maganine
Janet Hardy's personal account of
her experience with rape.In it she
comes to the conclusions that rape is
a special oppression against
women; rape should be stopped,
and only women can stop it. I agree
that it should be stopped.

Her other two conclusions,
however, and how she reached
them trouble me, and as a result I
ﬁnd myself writing this. I am in the
peculiar position of having shared
that rape with J anet—that is, I was
there—her fellow victim, whom she
mentions in her article.

In her role as a writer, Janet had

to condense the incident, select
certain portions, omit others and
choose her emphasis. What worries
me, however, are precisely which

portions she has omitted—those_
that weakened the power of the

political statement‘ her.a1-ticle was
try1n' lg to make.” 
Certainly, rape -is part of a

‘political issue, but it is also an act

that occurs between two people who
do not stop being human beings
during the rape. Much of what was
truly human about that incident
has been excluded from Janet’s
article.

By excluding those human
aspects, women, supposedly the
group being served by that article,
are reduced to political objects, not
unlike sex objects. Likewise, the
incident is reduced to being merly a
political vehicle.

I would like to offer those more
human parts of the incident so that
they can lie exactly beside the
political, where they originally
were, and where they belong.

Our rape particularly is difficult
to reduce ‘to one specialized
viewpoint. For instance, initiallywe
thought we were being "held at
gunpoint. . Fdiscbvered, however,
thatthe gun was a toy gun. Ifought
back, but was overpowered and
pushed again t6 the ground.

Scared (and unarmed); the rapist
kicked through the darkness,
connecting to my face and back as I
wriggled out of his reach. He had
won. Though my face hurt, the pain
of knowing I now had to submit to a
man with a toy gun was greater.

Along with that absurdity was the
fact that our “rapist” never
achieved a proficient enough
erection to fully enter either of us.
Though merely atechnical point, we
were never actually “raped.” This
man was incapable of doing so.

After his unsuccessful attempt to
enter Janet and during his fumbling
attempt to rape me, a short——and
very remarkable—moment oc-
curred that Janet misoonstrues in
her _article. I lay on the ground
under the weight of my incompetent
rapist, on my back looking up at
the springtime stars, appreciating
their beauty despite the pain in my
face andback.

The man made a sudden, sharp

' movement causing me an unex-

pected pain. On impulse, I let out a
sound of “Auh!” and my left hand
jerked to the air. The man reacted
instantly by wrapping my hand in
his and patting my hand in a gesture
of comfort and apology. He then
turned his torso toward my feet
again (to adjust matters more
comfortably).

My open hand stayed where it
was, suspended in the air between
us. When he turned to face me
again his shoulder came in contact
with my hand. Without reason, my

\,..>.w‘~,v,7:,T,\,V_._r,,.» ,  «. .

hand slid down to his _l_g_w,er,arm'and ‘

formed itselfrafoifnd the shape of

E "‘lﬁs"t?>rearm. Impulsively, his hand

wrapped itself around my wrist and
gently squeezed. Both hands then
slid towards each other, met, and
held in silence.

The.man’s arm, shoulders, neck
and chest relaxed, and a half-sigh,
half-groan came out of him. For
those twenty seconds, despite the
past twenty minutes, a real, human
connection happened between us.
It was totally out of sorts with the
surrounding situation, but there it
was.

Janet reduces all this to:“My
friend sympathetically said that she
put one hand on his arm, and his
arm muscles softened for just an
instant,” and dismisses it with “I
understand that fear produces
strange reactions.”

She refuses to admit the reality of

that moment, its genuineness and

its significance. Consequently, she
fails to perceive the incident as a
whole and can recognize only her
own fear and discomfort while
ignoring the total humannness of
the incident. Janet's report was one
of a tragedy inﬂicted upon her. She
does not allow the tragedy of the
man to be included and fails to see
even a ﬂicker of the comedy or the
absurdity that took place.

She does not mention that as we
lay next to each other on the ground,
our would-be rapist stood a short
distance from our feet and
masturbated in the moonlight. He
also kept our underwear.

It was as we were walking away
from this painfully farcical episode
that I said, as Janet accurately
quotes me, “Well, that’s life in the
big city.” What she apparently
does not understand, however, is
that my comment was in reference

, wholistic approach is crucial.

matter of having to go to a park in
order to be around trees, of that
not being a safe adventure, a man’s
displaced and dangerous search for
human contact,‘ a toy gun, the
absurdity of submitting to a toy gun,
my bloodied face, incompetent
intercourse, a masturbated climax,
the oblivious springtime trees with
their struggling new leaves, and the
totally dumb golf course ﬂag-mark-
ers. 'I'hat’s life in the big city.

I think that to affect real

Country Boy Denver a Hit in City 

, By GAILM. SIMMONS

Pitt News Staff Writer

A breath of fresh, sweet air came
to the Civic Arena Thurday evening
as John Denver sang in Pittsburgh
for the ﬁrst time.

Denver proved there is such a
thing as an “everyman’s concert”
as he performed to an audience
ranging in age from 9 to 90 that
shouted and applauded him,
mindless of sore throats or stinging
palms.

Denver walked on stage to a
recording of “The Music is You,”
and this theme prevailed as he
invited the audience to sing along,
“even on the verses.” Smiling and
responding to comments from the
audience, he displayed a remark-
able empathy with the crowd,
refreshing in a time when too many’
artists relate only to the microphone
in front of them.

The concert proceeded with
“Farewell Andromeda,” a song of
welcome that Denver wrote to
celebrate his experience with
Erhard Seminars Training. In the
same vein was “It Amazes Me”
from Denver’s most recent album,
“I Want to Live.” Both songs were
joyous—the words full of life and
the music full of rich rhythm guitar.

Denver then interjected the
classic Randy Sparks tune, “To-
day.” Using little backup instru-
mentation, Denver had his first
opportunity to display his prowess
as a lead guitarist, picking out a
lovely background to this familiar

story of a rover who nevertheless
appreciates the pleasures of each
moment.

The Denver entourage consisted
of nine members: Hal Blaine,
drums; Henry Gordy Jr., electric
bass and mandolin; James Burton,
lead guitar and dobro; Jim Horne,
recorder and ﬂute; Glen Hordon,
piano; Herb Peterson, banjo;
Danny Wiebling, harmonica, and
Renee Arman and Denny Brooks,
vocals.

Notable among this tight group of
musicians was ﬂutist Jim Horne,
whose sensitinve playing enhanced
such numbers as “Poems, Prayers,
and Promises,” Ripplin’ Waters”
and “Fly Away.”

Not the least of Denver’s backup
was his choral accompaniment,
present in the voices of the sell-out
crowd. The audience could be
heard softly on every song, and,
with encouragement, even man-
aged to sing harmony on ‘ ‘Saturday
Night in Toledo, Ohio, ’ ’ and a whole
chorus of “Country Roads,” all
without assistance from the lead
vocalist.

The “choir” was considerably
less successful in its attempt to be
the rhythm section on “Thank God
I’m a Country Boy.” Denver had to
stop the song and start it over
because the audience couldn’t clap
together on the downbeat.

Denver performed seven numbers
from his “I Want to Live” album,
and he paused frequently to chat
with the audience about what had

inspired the songs. Especially
touching was his story of how,
during the ﬁlming of his movie,
“Oh, God,” he was able to spend
only a few hours with his family over
Christmas. His and his family’s
unhappiness at the time led him to
question his work as a performer
and, eventually, to write “How Can
I Leave You Again?”

Denver was in ﬁne voice for a man
who had stepped off of a
problematical airplane less than an
hour before coming on stage. There
were a few touchy spots at the
beginning, but soon these were
ironed out and the high notes came
out cleanly, even near the close of
the two-and-a-half hour concert-
despite the fact he felt as if his
“...vocal cords are going to fall
out....”

His vocal cords sustained him,
providing not only sweet falsetto
notes, but also an occasional
“rough edge” in his middle range
that emphsized the pathos of
Denver’s love songs and the
exuberance of his songs in praise of
the wilderness. That rough edge
served as a reminder that the singer
was in search, not of the perfect
note or the perfect word, but of the
perfect feeling.

Following a dazzling version of
“Rocky Mountain High,” the band
left the stage, and only Denver and
his guitars remained. Alone,
Denver created a marvelous rapport
with the audience as he sang one of
his older songs, “Follow Me.” The

and Denver

crowd did follow,
proved he is an artist who needs no
fancy backing to please.

When the group returned,
Denver sang a song that was a frank
admission that he enjoys the
attentions of the audience, especial-
ly the ladies. Then, exclaiming
“God bless the Beatles,” Denver
asked, “Will you still need me, will
you still feed me, when I’m 64?”

A string of Denver’s country
tunes followed, including ‘ ‘Country
Roads,” “Back Home Again,”

“Grandma’s Feather Bed,” “Mat-.

thew” and the rowdy “Thank God
I’m~a Country Boy.” The excited

FRAN KS

crowd clapped, stomped, yelled,
whistled, and then sat rapt as
Denver performed “The Eagle and
the Hawk,” a beautifully compact
work that conveyed a great deal of
meaning with only 10 lines of lyric
and lushly arranged music.

The concert concluded with
“Annie’s Song,” “Calypso” and
“Sunshine On My Shoulders.”
There were no curtain calls and no ‘
encore, but the audience left the
Civic Arena well satisﬁed and
singing concert tunes in the parking
lot. If Denver had any doubts about
the reception he would receive in
Piittsburgh, this should set them to
rest. -

Student Concert Electrified

By TOM KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer
Students of the Pitt music
department put on an unusual
display of electronic music Tuesday
night at Frick Fine Arts auditor-

, ium.

The concert, directed by Robert
‘Morris, consisted of both taped-
music created by the individual
students and a live number
composed and performed by the
students as a group.

The taped pieces were played in
quadrophonic sound, and included
a variety of tones worthy of any
science ﬁction or mystery ﬁlm.
Sounds, ranging from guitars and
pianos to running water and
metallic intonations, jumped from
speaker to speaker. A darkened

auditorium hightened the effect of i
_ the music.

Individual taped compositions
included “You Won’t Find a Heroic
Ride to Heaven on Pretty Sounds”
by B.Scott Lee, “Inside Looking
Out” by George Nagle, “Homage
to Cowell” by Ron Lubetsky,
“Ramble On” by Mark Antonich,

“Omissions” by Michael Nichay
and “Guitars and Pianos” by
Bruce Frauson.

“We have an electronic studio
where people generate sounds with
synthesizers, or they use pre-
recorded material,” Morris said.
“They put the stuff on tape, and
mix it one way or another until they
get a result.” .

The live performance of the show
was highlighted by an array of
synthesizers, mixers and other
electronic equipment.

“I’ve been here two years at
Pitt,” Morris added, “and the
output for this program is a final
project in electronic music. Doing
a group composition like this one
can get into composition, group
dynamic and all kinds of other
things related to music.”

The live composition was brieﬂy
interrupted when the performers
apparently went berserk. They
began to scream at Morris, blew up
balloons on stage and made faces
at the audience.

“We decided that we needed a
good ‘middle’ for our program,”

Morris said. “Somebody said we
ought to do something absurd or

strange, and we wouldn’t tell each - V

9

other what we were doing until the
night of the concert. We felt we
needed this kind of comic relief in
the middle of this serious music.”

This show of absurdity was
climaxed by George Nagle’s
destruction of an old hi-ﬁ set.

“I had just bought a new stereo
system, and I did not know what to
do with the old one,” Nagle said.
“It seemed like the proper thing to
do at the time.”

The concert ended with a rush of
guitars and drums, and Morris
believed the audience was impress-
ed by the show.

“The audience’s reaction was
rather positive,” Morris said. “I (
think a lot of people get into this.§§"

Morris said the “avant-garde 
music of electronics definitely has a
future.

“This kind of music hasn’t really
reached the general public,” he
said. “New music tends to be a
little weird at ﬁrst, and then people

get used to it.”

(Continued on . Page 11)

“Some people think Army Nursing is the rifle range
and pulling K.P. It’s really amazing how little
they know.”

—Lieutenant Mary Ann Hepner

“Though I’m an Arm y%Nurse, I can also pursue outside
interests like dress—designing and sailing.

“One of the pluses of Army Nursing is the nature of
the nurse/patient relationship. I don’t treat patients like
numbers.‘ I follow their progress. I visit them after the
acute part of their illness is over. They are so appreciative.
It’s really part of a nurse’s job to help the patient through

      

an illness. . 5 ' 

“To me, it’s an important job . . . My family is very   
proud of me. I'm the first person in the family to join the ' '
military.

  
  

“The Army is a place of self-discovery. It’s a total
learning experience.” 7

If you’d like to join Mary Ann Hepner in the Army
Nurse Corps, here are a few facts you should know. Army
Nursing is open to both men and women, under the age
33, with BSN degrees. Every Army Nurse is a commis-
sioned officer.

You are not required to go through the Army’s
standard basic training: instead you attend a basic orienta-
tion course. Your initial tour is three years—-just enough
to try the job on for size.

Humble Gymnast Tressler Heading for National Meet

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staff Writer

Bonnie Tressler has been described by
both teammates and coaches as possibly the
most humble person on Pitt’s women’s
gymnastics team, but, when she takes to the
floor this weekend in the National
Championships, she waill lay all humility
aside.

“Bonnie (who will join teammate Myra
Bachuéhin in Seattle for the championships)
is a very unassuming person who never
admits to doing well,” said coach Donna
DeMarino. “This is very unusual for the
type of performer that she is.”

DeMarino has believed for some time that
both v~T1-essjer »(ene«’¢-3 tl‘iié‘:*f_l0th-ranked

gymnast in the nation, and now 17th) and
Bachuchin (who went from ﬁfth to seventh in
the national ratings) had an excellent chance
to qualify for the National Championships.

Tressler, who has been involved in
gymnastics for the past nine years, came to
Pitt primarily because of DeMarino.

“I knew Donna, and I knew that I could
work with her,” said Tressler.

“I really only considered one other
scholarship offer, from East Carolina
University. In the end, I chose Pitt because it
was closest to home,” she added.

Tressler is a veteran of national
competition and the holder of several titles.
In 1977, she was a qualiﬁer to the United

States Gymnastics Federation Class I Senior
Nationals held in Tempe, Ariz., and placed
third in the National Sokol competition in
Chicago. She was also the 1977 tri-state
balance beam champion and second in the
all-around.

Tressler believes that her experience has,

helped to ease the pressure she encountered
in her ﬁrst year of collegiate competition.

‘ ‘WhenI get nervous before a meet, I just
look over at the other team and say, ‘Look,
I’ve_ competed against them before, and beat
some of them, so why should Ibe nervous? It
always helps to know what to expect,”
Tressler said.

She saidthe upcoming national competi-

tion presents a different type of pressure
than she has ever faced before.

“I think that the team is sort of counting
on Myra and me, and we know that we aren’t
just competing for ourselves but for the
whole team,” Tressler said.

_ Once again resorting to her humble ways,
she thought that the entire team has been
working hard intpractice the past few weeks.

“Sometimes I get so frustrated on
practice. It seems as though there is a brick
wall standing between me and where I want
to go, but I just try to think about where I’m
going wrong.

“I hope I do well in the nationals. I guess

we (Tressler and Bachuchin) sort of owe it to

the teams," Tressler said."

Mitters Move Outdoors To Prepare for Opener
Robert Morris, Weather Main Pitt Foes

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

After being cooped up indoors
for most of the winter, most people
are happy when the weather
becomes warmer so they can do
more things outdoors. The Pitt
baseball team is among this happy
majority.

Taking advantage of the mild

w ther of the past week or two,

Outdoor drills began last week for Pitt.

  Either Duke or

  

the Panthers, who travel to Robert
Morris for a season-opening
doubleheader Friday, moved sev-
eral of their practice sessions last
week from the small gym in Trees
Hall to Trees Field.

It was the ﬁrst time the team
worked outdoors since it began
practice in February.

“Just to get outside is a great
feeling,” Pitt baseball coach Bobby

Lewis said. “It gets to be real
monotonous practicing indoors all
the time.”

“You get cabin fever in the

gym,” team captain and starting '

centerfielder Don Nania said‘.
“You can only do so many agility
and skill drills before you get tired.
You want to go outside so you can
hit and run and throw.”

With the cold weather starting to

   
   

 

break, the Panthers are praying for
another respite from the weather.
They want less rain than they
received last year, when a dozen or
so of their games were cancelled
because of inclement weather.
“It’s very discouraging to

‘ compete against the weather all the

time,” Lewis said. “It’s very
disruptive to a team’s momentum
to have games cancelled. It’s not
only a problem we have; it’s a
problem every Northeast baseball
team—college and high school-
has. Baseball is so doggone
dependent on the weather.”
“We usually schedule 30 to 32
games,” Nania said. “We’re lucky
if we get to play 20 of them.”
After traveling to Robert Morris,
the Panthers return home to play
Duquesne. Nania, a senior from
Taylor-Allderdice High School,
hopes the weather is
cooperative than it has been in the
past when the two teams have met.
f‘It‘ _would be nice to play
Duquesne since-it..is our home

opener and everything,”"NaniaF

said. “It would be nice to play all
our games, but the weather doesn’t
always allow us to do that.”

The situation prompted Lewis to
say that the Panthers have two
main goals for the season: “We
want to play them all and win them

all.”
Nania noted that in the past four

years, an identical number of early
season games between the two city
schools have been wiped out
because of the weather.

Kentucky Will sie the st Loui Blue

By BOB LABRIOLA

Color St. Louis blue for the finals of the NCAA
tournament tonight at 9 p.m. _

The‘ Blue‘ Devils earned their share of the center
stage by defeating’ Notre Dame behind 20-point per-
formance by Mike Gminski (29), Gene Banks (22)
and Jim Spanarkel (20). , .

Kentucky’s victoryover Arkansas was far less ar-
tistic than tD_uk_e’s, mostly due to the two referees,
who seemed determined to make their presence
known to the fans at the Checkerdome as well as the
national television audience. ‘

Duke spared the -athletic world the prospect of
having to live with the fact that Notre_ Dame had a
chance to become the only university in history to
win national championships in football and basket-
ball in the same year. Irish fans, among the most
pompous and obnoxious in the country already, do
not need such fame to fuel their arrogance.

The Wildcats, or Big Blue as their fans refer to
them, will take the court against one of the Cin-
derella teams of the tournament with the added
pressure of being the game’s favorite. Kentucky had
been picked by many to win it all from the start of the
season and has been able to handle the pressure this
far. But faltering now would be as costly as a
demolitions crew developing a case of Parkinson’s
disease.

Duke coach Bill Foster negated Notre Dame’s

. depth‘ advantage by giving his starters short breathers

throughout the earlystages of the first and second

half,’ enabling the Blue Devils to be refreshed down
the stretch. The Blue Devils also have the advantage
of playing in the ACC pressure cooker through the
season, giving the youngsters several opportunities to
see the end of the season staring them in the face as
they stood at the free throw line. If the game
develops into a symphony of referees’ whistles, Duke
will be fortunate to stay within 10 points.

The most important man onthe floor tonight will
be Kentucky’s Kyle Macy, the quarterback of the
Wildcat offense. When Macy got into foul trouble
against the Razorbacks and-had to take a seat, Ken-
tucky became ragged on offense, and the crisp ball
movement that had been so effective did not return
until the 6-3 sophomore did. . A

There are few second guards in the country that
compare with Spanarkel, and the Wildcats’ Truman
Claytor is definitely not one of them. The 6-5 junior
can score from anywhere, is a dangerous passer,
steals the ball from everyone, and most importantly,
Spanarkel’s poise spreads to the other Blue Devils
making them more mature than their age might in-
dicate.Spanarkel negates any Kentucky advantage in
the backcourt. '

Rick Robey and Mike Phillips, the Wildcats’ ver-
sion of Barry and Garry Nelson, will match-up with

‘Kenny Dennard and Gminski. Although neither of

the Kentucky pair will ever be confused with Tinker-
bell, they are effective at pounding the offensive
boards and opposition with equal regularity. Robey,

among the nation’s leaders in field goal accuracy,
will pose problems for Dennard, who has a tendency
to commit cheap fouls.

Dennard will be having problems, but they could
be nothing compared to what Phillips will be up
against battling Gminski. If he could eliminate the
periods of timidity that strike him every once in a
while, Gminski could be the most dominant force on
the floor. Look for Joe Hall to go to James Lee
early.

Jack Givens could be one of the most talented
players in the nation this year, and Banks will cer-
tainly reach that plateau before his career is over.
Banks could either hit his potential early and\ cook
Kentucky’s goose, or play like a freshman, but rest

assured Givens will play his usual game and score 16 '

to 20 points.

To win, Duke most play 40 minutes of basketball
with the intensity it showed in the first half against
the Irish.

Duke must stay out of foul trouble and hope Ken-

-tucky is not so fortunate; the Blue Devils have to

keep the Wildcat beef off the offensive boards; they
will have to shoot well, make their free throws and
keep turnovers _at a minimum, and the ACC cham-

Formation of NEW

UNION PROGRAM COUNCIL

A totally new campus-wide programming structure is now being designed by the Office of Student Activities,
existing programming groups, and the undergraduate student government. This organization is being formed
with the express purpose of bringing quality programs to campus while providing social, educational, and
practical learning experiences in the process. This will contribute to individual and collective student growth
and couple programming efforts with professional management and guidance. This group will be called THE
UNION PROGRAM COUNCIL which through its varied activities will become the out—of-class laboratory
for creative programming and leadership development. -- ~

The following objectives will be met through this new council:

1 . Provision of well balanced programming

2. Consolidation of existing human and fiscal resources

3. Application of the learning process to programming

4. Enhancement of student personal growth

5. Provision of vehicle for program training and management

6. Establishment of a centralized resource center for all campus programming groups
7. Provision of student input for student union renovation
