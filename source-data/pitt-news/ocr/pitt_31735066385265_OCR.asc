UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

VOLUME EIGHTY-THREE, ISSUE THIRTY-NINE

By David Espo

AP Political Writer

George Bush and Michael
Dukakis both laid claim Sun-
day to precious, last—minute
momentum in their campaign
marathon, the vice president
declaring the tide was ”mov—
ing in our direction” and the
combative underdog insisting
he was ”rocking and rolling”
to an election upset Tuesday.

The political equivalent of a
nuclear exchange occurred on

television, where the'Repub|i—

cans and Democrats spent mil-
lions of dollars in advertising
for the waning hours of the
campaign. The two candidates
bought time for 30-minute
commercials on all three
major networks for election
eve on Monday.

Although national polls
pointed to a victory by GOP
nominee Bush, both candi-
dates battled the clock and
physical exhaustion in a final
drive to snare undecided
voters and nail down the

presidency.

NBC News said Bush led
nationally by five percentage
points, and that one of every
five voters was undecided or

«might switch allegiance.

”There ain’t no stopping us
now unless we stop our-
selves,” the vice president said
at a breakfast rally in Colora-
do Springs, Colo.

”We can't turn the White
House over to the people who
claim to be on our side but
who left the country on its

Candidates claim momentum as campaign winds down

back,” Bush said.

Countered Dukakis, also be-
ginning his day in Colorado:
”He’s slipping and sliding,
we’re rocking and rolling.” He
sought to raise fears over the
possibility that Bush — if elect-
ed — might put vice presiden-
tial running mate Dan Quayle
in charge of the White House
crisis management team.

”Gives you the chills,
doesn't it?” Dukakis asked.

 ”Think about it — the Cuban
missile crisis, with Dan

Quayle in charge.”

Democrats voiced confi-
dence they would retain or
perhaps widen their majorities
in the House and Senate in
Tuesday's balloting, and they
got little dissent from Repub-
licans on that score.

One of the tightest Senate
races was in Florida, where a
late-hour poll showed a virtu-
al dead heat between
Democratic Rep. Buddy
MacKay and Republican Rep.

 Jazz

Seminar

ends on

high note

By Adam W. Richter
Staff Writer

The 18th annual Jazz Seminar
concluded on Saturday with a
concert at Carnegie Music Hall.

According to Nathan Davis,
chairman of the 1988 Jazz Semi-
nar Committee, it was one of the
best Jazz Seminar concerts ever
held.

’’I had a ball,’’ Davis said, at-
tributing much of the concert’s
success to the energetic response
of the audience throughout the
concert.

The Jazz Concert featured
Grover Washington Jr. and Davis
on saxophone, Freddie Hubbard
and Terrence Blanchard on trum-
pet, Billy Cobham on drums,

.Monty Alexander on piano and

Abraham Laboriel on bass. _

After the intermission, Hubbard
received a plaque for his achieve-
ments as a musician which was
presented by Dr. Donald Hender-
son, the vice provost at Pitt and
the evening’s master of
ceremonies.

”Whenever you're recognized
in your own country, it makes
you feel proud,” said Hubbard of
his award. Hubbard added that
because jazz is not well recog-
nized throughout the world,
many musicians turn to drugs and
alcohol.

”Awards like this will help me
to help other guys to stay
straight,” he continued. ’’I should
continue to play the best I can.”

Davis agreed with Hubbard,
stating that ”in the United States,
people won’t give money to
jazz” as opposed to the
symphony.

Hubbard studied jazz at Butler

Retired Haitian commander-dies of heart attack

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP)
— Retired Col. Jean-Claude Paul,
who commanded Haiti's most-
feared army unit and was indict-
ed in Miami on drug charges,
died Sunday of a heart attack,
Haitian radio reported.

NEWS BRIEFS,

Radio Haiti-Inter said Paul died
at about 3 p.m. in his home in
suburban La Boule. It gave no
other details. He was 49.

Paul was retired in September
after a coup led by rank-and—file

, officers ousted the nation's mili-

tary leader, Lt. Gen. Henri Nam-
phy and replaced Namphy with
Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril. .

Paul had been linked to the
Tonton Macoutes, the personal
forces of the dictatorship of the
Duvalier family. He served as
commander of the 700—man Des-
salines Battalion, the most brutal
unit in Haiti's 7,000-member
army.

Soldiers from the Dessalines
Barracks under Paul's command
have been blamed for wide-
spread violence that forced the‘

cancellation of general elections
in Haiti last November and left
more than 30 people dead.

Paul had been considered one
of the most powerful members of
the army.

In March, he was indicted by
a federal grand jury in Miami on
charges of conspiring to import

cocaine into the United States.

Bush holds solid lead
in three opinion polls

NEW YORK (AP) ~ George
Bush led solidly for the presiden-
cy in three opinion polls on Sun-
day, and while two other surveys
put the race a bit closer, a 50—state
poll gave him an overwhelming
advantage in electoral votes.

Bush led firmly in 25 states
with enough electoral votes to
deliver the election to him, ac-
cording to the 50-state, ABC
News—Washington Post poll of
7,777 likely voters. Another 16
states were said to be leaning for
Bush.

The poll rated only the District
of Columbia firm for Democrat

Michael Dukakis and three states

leaning his way. Six states were
rated a toss—up.

in popular support nationally,
Bush led Dukakis by 10 points,
54-44 percent, in the ABC-Post
poll, conducted Wednesday
through Saturday; by 12 points,
53-41 percent, in a Gallup poll
done Thursday through Saturday;
and by 9 points, 51-42, in a CBS
News poll Friday and Saturday.

Two other surveys found five-
point margins: 48-43 in an NBC
News-Wall Street /ournal poll
Tuesday through Saturday and
50-45 in one done Wednesday
through Saturday by Louis Harris
and Associates.

Amnesty program
reaches second phase

(AP) — The second phase of the
federal government's immigra-
tion amnesty program starts Mon-
day, when thousands of amnesty
recipients can begin applying for
permanent residency and get
their so—called green cards.

Federal officials expect about

1.5 million of the 1.8 million
non-agricultural workers who ap-
plied for amnesty under the Im-
migration Reform and Control
Act of 1986 to apply for perma-
nent residency.

But that figure may be optimis-
tic, authorities said, because
some potential applicants could
find themselves shut out of over-
crowded English and civics class-
es they must take to qualify for
permanent residency.

In Los Angeles, at least one
school — the Evans Community
Adult School —— has been holding
classes 24 hours a day to handle
the crush.

Communications tycoon
dies after long—time illness

NEW ORLEANS (AP) ~— Nor-

man N. Newhouse, who helped
build the world's largest private-
ly held communications empire,
including 26 newspapers across
the country, died Sunday after a
long illness. He was 82.

While the family's holdings ex-
panded widely, taking in Conde
Nast Magazines, major book
publishing houses and cable tel-
evision systems, Newhouse re-
mained a shirtsleeves newspaper-
man.

He usually was at his desk by
6 a.m., company officials said.
For the past 20 years, he was
based in New Orleans, although
much of his time was spent
traveling to Alabama and Ohio to
visit Newhouse newspapers
there. He did not take a role in

the day-to—day operations of the
Times—Picayune, the Newhouse
group’s paper in New Orleans.

Like his brothers, the late
Samuel I. Newhouse, and Theo-
dore, he shunned the limelight
and was little known outside the
newspaper business.

The Newhouse empire now is
run by S.l. Newhouse’s two sons,
Samuel I. Jr. and Donald. It in-
cludes Vogue, Gourmet, Vanity
Fair, HG, CO and the New Yor-
ker magazines, the Parade Sun-
day newspaper supplement, the
Random House book publishing
group and cable television sys-
tems serving a million homes.

Before moving to New Orleans
in I967, Newhouse was editor of
The Long Island Press in Jamaica,

Dukakis is the man
to lead the country

It began with a group of Democrats called ”the seven
dwarfs” and a host of Republicans, among them a teI»evan—

. gelist and a vice president. Tomorrow, America will make

its choice.
The '88 Presidential Election is upon us, and in the mind

_ of The Pitt News, thechoice must be made for Michael

Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen.
As college students, one of our most immediate needs
is financing higher education. The Dukakis platform on

0 college aid proves Dukakis is a candidate who wants stu-

dents to be able to borrow the money they need and reim-
burse it through money they earn after building a stable
foundation. .Dukakis _ has said, ”No qualified’ student
should ever be denied a college education "because of

8 financial need.” I’ - s

George Bush has mentioned a tax—free bond program;

“however, the family will have to save the money first be-

fore gaining this tax—free ”dom.” As well, Bush's eight-

year mentor Ronald Reagan has slashed education fund-

ing on more than one occasion. .
On defense spending, Dukakis suggests the lessening

‘ of funds for defense development, including a $3 billion

reduction in SDI, while Bush favors the ”peace through
strength” tactic of forcing the Soviet Union into peace
negotiations. I is

‘We cannot put our environment in the hands of a man
like George Bush, who felt James Watt was an ”excellent”
secretary of the interior.

In addition, several seats on the Supreme Court may be

. opened within the next four years, and the country needs

a president who will support justices who are not going
to be conservative with our basic ‘American freedoms.
It was said in 1980 that the chant of the Reagan-Bush
camp was ”it’s time for a change.” It has also been said
that history repeats itself. This election is a case in point.
We can only hope that the Electoral College is one that
Dan Quayle’s father can't buy his son into.

SGB candidates need

Each year the Student Govern— mall‘ WI“ tell YOU that 3 mere WV0

‘ment Board allocates approxi-
mately $400,000 of student
money to student groups. If you
don't already know it, your $32
per term activities fee goes right
to the SGB so that it can distrib-
ute it to the various certified stu-
dent groups.

I If you don't care where $64 of
your money goes every school
year, then don't vote in the SGB
elections on Nov. 15 and 16. If
you don't care that your Calc T.A.
can't speak good English, don't
vote in the SGB elections.

There are 10 people running
for eight positions on the SGB,
and one person running for presi-

I didn't think that Oakland was
as bad.as it was last year. I mean,
I don't know anybody who has
been jumped by a bunch of high
school kids while innocently
walking by.

I know of at least three who
were jumped last year. One guy
was knocked silly in front of the
”O” when he was konked on the
head with a beer bottleduring a
busy night in front of the estab-
lishment.

This year, there has been a
plethora of cops on Oakland
street corners. This has probably
kept the violence down on the
main streets. Now these delin-
quents have moved to the Oak-
land side streets.

While walking along Atwood
Street to my apartment last Satur-
day night, I saw a bunch of these
”tough guys’-’ running toward
me. I thought the worst as I
braced myself for a_fight.

Instead of doing anything, they
just ran past. I was relieved be-
cause I was a little tired and
wasn't in the mood to take on a
gang of high schoolers.

I kept traveling down the street,
and I heard some more noise.
Somebody was yelling in pain,
and somebody else was yelling in

I anger. I thought the worst again.-

Here we go, another gang.

I was thrilled at what I saw
next. There was one guy, average
build, just pounding the bejesus
out of a younger looking fellow.
At first I thought that this was a
mugging and the other guys were
running away as part of a
celebration. '

system. Jeff Nichols wants to
change the overnight visitation
policy. Jill Phillips wants to im-
prove the service at the Student
Health Service. Erik Sossman
wants T.A.s to have to speak bet-
ter English.

The question is, will any stu-
dents actually ever hear the differ-
ent messages of the candidates?
If so, will they vote for the candi-
dates they agree with? Ifthey do
vote, will they care to show up
at SGB meetings to ensure that

‘the SGB is doing what it said it

would do?

The general consensus among
the candidates is that students are
not well enough informed about
the goings-on on campus. Apa-

It is time to defend ourselves

‘ .

   

VINCE
CAREY

Boy, was I wrong. The bigger,
older gentleman was retaliating
for what had happened earlier. It
seems that these idiots jumped
this guy and thought they could
get away with it.

This guy must have just started
hitting back when he was at-
tacked. He was taking the youn-

/, ger guy to the cleaners. He was
bouncing them off the sidewalk,
off parked cars and off his fist.

After applying a severe beating
to his would—be attacker, he
grabbed the kid's collar and said
something to the effect of, ”Let’s
see what the police have to say
about you now.”

Needlessto say, the dummy
tried to get away. At first he
couldn't, but then he was able to
escape. He then took off. The
retaliator just stood there laugh-
ing, holding the collar . in his
hand.

I was a little dumbfounded.
Somebody stood up for his rights
and fought back. Maybe if more

thy, they are constantly proclaim-
ing, is paralyzing the campus in
some way or another. But is it
really apathy, or a lack of leader-
ship from above?

An example of what students
should have been interested in is
computer availability. Nobody
seemed to care that there weren't
enough computers on campus,
but SGB President Craig Jackson
didn't care that nobody else
cared. Jackson spent his term in
office getting the university ad-
ministration to install more com-
puters, including creating a new
computer lab on Bouquet Street.

— Apathy on campus seems to be
a circular process. The SGB

people started doing that, these
kids would learn their lesson and
not mess with anybody.

.I think it would solve a lot of
problems with the Oakland area.
Keep these dummies away_by
taking matters into your own

hands. 9

This reminds me of the scene
in The Untouchables when Sean
Connery was talking to Kevin

Costner about how they could ‘

stop Capone.

”When you open the door on
these guys you have to be pre-
pared to go all the way,” Con-

V nery said. V

If you don't want - to be
bothered while innocently walk-
ing your girlfriend back to her
apartment, you have to stand up
for justice. The police on the
street aren't going to do anything;
they'll just break it up. You will
still be the one damaged.

This past Saturday I was again 9).

walking down«Atwo0d with a
few people. There was an older

» man lying on the ground. At first

we thought he was just drunk;
then we saw a group of attackers
running away. In fact, one of
them yelled, ”We’ll do it right
next time, he won't be able to get
up.”

A really intelligent statement by
an obvious pillar of society.

We helped the guy up and
found out that besides a few
bruises, he was allright. I could
only think what might have hap-
pened if we could have gotten
there a little sooner.

to reverse current apathetic trend

doesn't try to stirrup student sup- 0

port of anything and students
don’-t support anything. Luke
Kluchko, president of the SGB in
1985, has said that he had to
move SGB meetings to the Ball-
room of the student union be-
cause so many people showed
up. Today, the SGB is lucky if all
of its members are present.

The problem with most of the 0

candidates is that they all want to
be good listeners and that they
want student input. Maybe the
SGB should stop listening, and
start leading. *

THE PITT NEWS

[Recently] Congress passed
an amendment to the drug bill
that provides the stiffest penal-
ties yet against those who
manufacture, distribute and
view pornographic and ob-
scene materials. The new law
reverses a 30-year trend by the
courts that allowed por-
nographers to hide behind the
First Amendment and produce
the vilest forms of pornogra-
phy and obscenity.

The measure, called the
”Child Protection and Ob-
scenity Enforcement Act of
I987," will, among other
things, prohibit the buying and
selling of children for use in
the production of por-
nography.

Yes, until this law was
passed, it‘was legal for a par-

dy of a minor, such as a
baby-sitter or day-care worker,
to sell or offer to sell a child
for use in the production of
pornography or assisting in its
production. The new penalty
for doing so is 20 years to life
in prison and a $250,000 fine.

Most Americans still think of
pornography in terms of old
Playboy magazines, but Play-
boy is mild compared to the
mental sewage dumped into
the public ”water supply” by
the multibillion-dollar porn in-
dustry, which spews forth not
only sexually explicit situa-
tions involving children but
bestiality as well.

The bill sponsored by the
administration will prohibit
the use of computers in the ad-
vertisement, distribution or
reception of child pornogra-
phy and related information.
Groups like the North Ameri-
can Man-Boy Love Associa-
tion have used computer
bulletin boards to keep track
of minor children for use by

pedophiles. That will now cost

A triumph over obscenity

them a maximum I0-year pri-
son term and $100,000 fine.
Repeat offenders can get
more.

The measure will also estab-
lish new record-keeping re-
quirements aimed at protect-
ing minors from being used in
sexually explicit materials.
Those using pictures of sexu-
al situations may now be re-
quired to prove that those

CZAL
THOMAS

ent or other adult with custo- '

depicted are not minors, and
the user must keep records
dating back 10 years for any
picture he reproduces detail-
ing the age of a subject if he
is ever challenged.

It will provide for the seizure
or forfeiture of profits generat-
ed by pornography. This in-
cludes not only money, but
property purchased with the
profits and, at a judge's discre-
tion, perhaps even a‘ store or
home where illegal activity oc-
curred.

Under the measure, the sale
of obscene materials or child
pornography will be prohibit- ‘
ed on federal property, which
would include military bases.
Wiretapping is allowed in the
investigation of felony ob-
scenity cases. Obscenity on
cable television or other sub- -
scription television is out-
lawed. Included for the first
time is satellite communica-
tion of such films into hotel
and motel chains, which rake
in substantial profits from
showing ”dirty” movies.

And the ‘new law prohibits
dial-a—porn services which, in
New York City alone, have
resulted in 500,000 calls per
day with daily profits of
$25,000.

Predictably, the American

Civil Liberties Union plans to
fight the new law in court, but
those who drafted it say even
congressional opponents
raised no constitutional objec-
tions during internalrdebate. 
Supporters believe the meas-
ure will stand the court test.

Polls have shown that most
Americans  are supportiveof
efforts to tighten government
control over such material.

Surgeon General C. Everett

Koop has said, "I believe we
have enough evidence to im-
plicate pornography as a seri-
ous contributing factor to
certain disorders of human
health. And I feel strongly that
pornography has also been
clearly implicated as a kind of
‘accessory’ to antisocial ac-
tions that produce grave and
profoundly harmful out-
comes.”

-Koop is right. Vice squads
report that 77 percent of those
who molest boys and 87 per-
cent of girl child molesters ad-
mit patterning their actions
after pornographic materials.
Each year, one million chil-
dren, ranging in age from 6
months to 16 years, are sexu-
ally molested and then filmed
or photographed.

The child pornography and
obscenity law is a tribute to
the Reagan administration, in-
cluding former ‘Attorney
General Edwin Meese, whose
commission produced much
of the raw (and I do mean I
”raw”) material for the legis-
lation’s authors. After more
than three decades, the law is
now on the side of the victims
of pornography instead of the
sleaze merchants who have
been indulging themselves in

obscene profits.

The new son of Bush

Every political campaign
manager saves a thunderbolt for
the last week before Election
Day. George Bush's people are
no exception.

I've known Rovere for ages. He
is one of the best political han-
dlers in the business, and except
for getting the date of Pearl Har-
bor wrong, he has never missed
kicking the ball through the goal
posts.

ART  
BUCHWALD

We were sitting in the bar and
he said, "I suppose you're won-
dering if we're going to pull a rab-
bit out of the hat." ‘

I replied, ’’I don't believe a
newspaperman should inquire
into a politician's business.”

”We intend to take care of the
Quayle problem once and for
all,” Rovere said.

’’I'm ready if you are,” I told
him.

Rovere looked around the
room and then said, ”Bush is go-
ing to adopt Dan Quayle as his
son.”

”Before the election?" I asked.

”The news will wipe Dukakis
off the networks. He won't be
able to get a sound bite on a ca-
ble station in Butte, Montana.”

"I understand the publicity
value, but why else would Bush
want to adopt Quayle?"

”To silence the critics once and
for all. They will no longer be
asking why Bush chose Quayle
as his vice president. The answer
will be obvious. It's because
Quayle is his son."

”There has never been a father-
son relationship in the White
House. Was it hard selling it to
Bush?" '

”Not very. We explained to
him that by adopting Quayle, the
voters will see the warm, com-
passionate side of Bush that he
has been hiding since the cam-

paign started. Also, this allows
George to deal directly with the
‘President Quayle’ issue. When
people see them together as
father and son, it will make the
country feel less nervous that
Quayle is a heartbeat away from
the White House.”

”This has the makings of a
news story. When are you going
to announce it?”

”In a day or two. We want Bar- .

bara Walters to film the actual
adoption ceremony with Ronnie
and Nancy holding the Bible.
When the press asks him why,
Bush will say he decided to go
ahead with it because Quayle
was the most qualified son a
president could have."

"’It's good," I said, ”and it's
good because it's true. I have
nothing but admiration for the
way you people have handled
this campaign. And having Bush
adopt the vice presidential candi-

date as his son is the final stroke,

of genius. When did you decide
this?”

Rovere ordered another drink. '

”The trick’ in politics is to do the
unexpected. When Quayle's
military record was exposed,
everyone expected Bush to drop

-him. We decided to have him

adopt Dan instead, because no
one could complain if a father
didn't want his son to go to war."

’.’What puzzles me is that with
the polls showing Bush so far
ahead, why would George want
another son?"

"Because. Although he has

several of his own, there's no-
body quite like Dan Quayle.''
"J. Danforth Quayle Bush has

a nice ring to it," I told Rovere.-

He said, "The adoption won't
affect the true believers, but when
the undecidedssee George car-
rying Quayle onihis shoulders,
they'll be so moved that they will
give Bush a landslide.”

Fighting abortion is simply an attempt to save lives

Your recent editorial (”|ntimi—
dation is not civil disobedience")
[Oct. 20] condemned ”Operation
Rescue" because of the illegality
of blocking abortion clinic en-
trances. '

We do not give life, so who are
we to legislate or vote away the
unborn's right to live, because it
might cause us some incon-
venience? If we say that a wom-
an has the right to do with her
body as she sees fit, this means
it's her right to choose whether or
not to have sex, and so invite the
possibility of pregnancy. It does
not mean she has the right to
deny the consequences of her
own actions, at the complete ex-
pense of someone else, whose
body is under her intimate care.

The unborn baby is not the

cause of unwanted pregnancy, so’

why is he or she made the help-
less scapegoat? What kind of so-
lution attacks the effect rather
than thecause? [...]

We can legislate whatever
abomjnation we like; but that
doesn't make it right, and doesn't
”abort” the conquences. But if
we insist on seeing things in le-
gal terms, we should remember
the basis, the American Constitu-
tion. Our founding fathers didn't

. deem it so important to concoct
their own laws as to implement
the laws of God, which alone

LETTERS

have absolute implications. And
so they said: ' I

’’...all men are endowed by
their Creator with certain in-
alienable rights, that among these
are life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness, that to secure these
rights, governments are instituted
among men..."

Homecoming needed parade

This letter is concerning the
cancellation of the Homecoming
parade on Saturday, Oct. 22.

Beginning on Monday, Oct.
1‘ 7, various student organizations
began constructing floats. The
students working on the Fresh-
man Council/SGB float and the
other organizations put a lot of
time and effort into their projects.
They gave up valuable study and
leisure time to work on the floats.

Not only the. students, but
many Pitt alumni were upset

about the cancellation of the pa-
rade. One gentleman from
California commented, ”I was
very disappointed about the can-
cellation of Friday's events and
the parade, so I didn't even go to
the dean's dinner because I had
enough." Also, a 1938 graduate
was so upset about the cancella-
tion of the parade [that he] said
he wasn't planning to go to the
football game. 

What upset us even more were
the excuses given to us by the Pitt
Program Council. When asked
why they canceled the parade,
they gave us the following
reasons:

1. Saturday morning the Na-
tional Weather Service predicted
light sprinkles until noon.

2. The students in the parade
would have complained because
the rain would have ruined their
floats.

3. The band uniforms would
get wet and be ruined. [...]

We feel the reasons the PPC
gave us were not sufficient
enough to cancel the parade. We
also feel that the PPC, a student
organization, should have had
the other student organizations
voice their opinion on canceling
the parade. We would like a clear

and rational explanation, an apol-
ogy, and compensation for the
float sponsors from the PPC.

Nicole Vitale
Freshman Council

This letter is in response to the
decision of the Pitt Program
Council regarding the cancella-
tion of this year's Homecoming
parade. I think this decision was
»made irrationally and selfishly.
The PPC's reasons, we were told,
were that it was raining in the
morning and they had expensive
convertibles in the parade for the
Homecoming court to ride in.
They said they couldn't afford to
have the interiors of the cars
ruined. Meanwhile, we, like the
majority of other organizations
on campus, spent many weeks
preparing for the parade, and
hours upon hours of time putting
our float together. I think the time
and money we all spent is much
more valuable thana few cars
that didn't necessarily have to be
in the parade anyhow. The
Homecoming king and queen
were crowned at the football
game that day, which means that
the parade could have gone on
without them if it rained. The sad

part, is my friends and I had been
up since'5:30 in the morning put-
ting our float together, and we
didn't see any rain until very late
in the afternoon, when the pa-
rade would have been long over.
And we weren't even informed of
the parade’s cancellation until
about one half hour before line-
up was to take place. By that
time, we were all so excited to
show off our Homecoming
”masterpiece,” and so that's what
we did. We all jumped on the
float and drove it to the Student
Union, where we parked it, and
finally, with much regret, tore it
apart.  But before we took it
apart, we received many cheers

and support from alumni and  _

[others] who were also infuriated
by PPC's decision and felt that the
parade should not have been
canceled.  Thanks to the PPC,
our Homecoming float was, in
the end, what was supposed to
be a display of pride in our
school, stuffed into a bunch of
garbage bags.

Election

Continued from page 1

Connie Mack for the seat be-
ing vacated by Democratic
Sen. Lawton Chiles.

Democrats also hoped for
modest gains among the 12
statehouse races on the ballot.

It was the costliest campaign
in American history, and just
one piece of it, a series of
California ballot initiatives,
had a price tag ofmore than
$100 million.

Bush aide Al‘ixe Glen
described the vice president's
rapidly changi.ng itinerary as a
’’Magical Mystery Tour.”
Dukakis tried to defy the clock
and was flying overnight from

Spokane to Cleveland and
then St. Louis — and then back
to the West Coast for a noon
rally Monday.

Bush professed little doubt
about the outcome Tuesday.

”Things are moving‘ in our
direction,” he said as he raced
Sunday from Colorado to
California to Michigan.

Dukakis, in a desperate
race, noted that both_candi-
dates began the day in
Colorado.

A series of state polls provid-
ed a picture of several close
races. One poll gave Bush a
17-point lead in Texas, with its
29 electoral votes.

Newhouse

Continued from page 3

N.Y., and, before that, The Stat-
en Island Advance (N.Y.).
Newhouse started selling The
Bayonne Times (N.J.) when he
was 5 years old. The price was a
penny a copy, and he was al-
lowed to keep half, plus tips.
S.l. Newhouse recalled that his
brother quickly realized he could
sell more if he just held one paper
and said, pleadingly, ”Mister,
please buy my last paper.” As
soon as he sold it, the fledgling

entrepreneur would run off to get «

another from a nearby stack.

Newhouse attended New York
University and worked summers
in the classified and advertising
departments at the Advance,
which S.l. Newhouse had bought
in 1922. After graduation, he be-
came a reporter, and later city
editor and managing editor at the
Advance.

In 1937, when S.l. Newhouse 99-

bought The Long Island Press,
Norman went there as editor, his
last title in the newspape
business. ‘

THE PITT NEWS

Panthers
net fifth
victory of
season

By Vince Carey

Sports Editor

It rained during the first half of
Pitt's 1988 final home game.
Poured, actually. But the Panthers
didn't let the weather bother
them in a 20-10 mistake—filled
win over the Scarlet Knights of
Rutgers.

This game marked the third
straight win for the Panthers as
they improved their record to 5-3.
Rutgers dropped to 4-5.

”There were so many mis-
takes,” Pitt coach Mike Gottfried
said. ”We made them, I made
them, everybody made them. It
was good to come out of this with
a win. lt’s.like I said to the‘play-
ers, “Maybe this is a game a cou-
ple of years ago we might have
lost.’ We just kept going and
found a way to win.”

The mistakes were evident all
around. The Panthers committed
I4 penalties for 134 yards, while
Rutgers was flagged seven times
for 65 yards. The Knights lost two
fumbles and threw one inter-
ception.

An example of how the game
went is something that happened
late in the second quarter. Ona
fourth-and-goal from the Rutgers

I 2 with no time-outs left, Pitt had’

to rush the field goal unit onto the
field. They snapped the ball just
as the half came to an end.

Flanker Billy Osborn picked
the ball up and tried to run it in.
When he saw that it was impos-
sible, he tried to pass the ball to
tight end Dave Tanzos.. The pass
floated into the hands of a Rutgers
linebacker. End of drive,'and Pitt
had to settle for a 3-0 halftime
lead.

”We were just trying to get one
more play in before the half end-
ed,” Gottfried said. ”By that time,
everything was so botched up
that we were just lucky to get
everybody on the field. Billy just
called for the ball quick, and he
wasn’t sure if Scott [Kaplan] was
set, so he took off with the ball.’’

The weather affected the
Knights’ offense more than any-
thing. Because of the rain, Rut-
gers had to change their game
plan from a run-and-shoot to
mostly a straight run game.

Yet, it didn't make much of a
difference, because they didn’t
have the ball that often. The Pitt
offense controlled the clock with
long, sustained drives. The Pan-
thers held the ball for 42:58 and
ran 93 total offensive plays (73 of
which were on the ground).

”We wanted to do just what
we did do, but we didn't get
much opportunity with so many
possessions,” Rutgers coach Dick
Anderson said. ”They kept our
defense on the field an awful lot
and our defense began to wear
down. That put our offense out of
sync. When we did have the ball,
we couldn't sustain any drives.”

Pitt started their clock domina-
tion on their very first possession.

put the ball through the end zone

Seniors have mixed emotions over
final home game of Pitt careers

By Scot Ross

Contributing Editor

When the final gun sounded in
Saturday’s 20-1 0 victory over Rut-
gers, Pitt's seniors headed to the
home-team locker room for the
last time as Panthers.

With only three road games re-
maining in the season, Pitt's ’88
graduating class is not only look-
ing ahead to the future, but also
back at its years with the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh.

After the game, Coach Mike
Gottfried said, ”Today we said

- good—bye to 13 seniors and that

was on the mind of everyone, to
make sure they went out a
winner.

”It’s a special day when you
play your last game. It's special
because everybody [has] got to
play hard to try to reward that. In
some ways it's a very happy day,
because they're going on to
different things, but it's a very sad
day because it's the last time
we'll be together on this home
field.

”There’s a lot of camaraderie in
athletics, and that's what makes
it what it is today,” Gottfried con-
tinued.

Senior middle linebacker and
team leader in tackles (96) Jerry
Olsavsky has grown accustomed
to success at Pitt. Going into the

year he was named to Don Hein-
rich’s College Football Second
Team All-American, Athlon All-
East, to The Sporting News Sec-
ond Team All-Independent, Don
Heinrich’s College Football All-
Independent Team and the Foot-
ball Action All-Independent
Team.

’’It still really hasn’t’hit me,”
Olsavsky said. ”I went out before
the game and it felt pretty good
going out and getting introduced,
but I don’t think it [has] really hit
me yet what this really means to
me.”

Burt Grossman, defensive end,
had similar reactions about his
last game on the hill.

’’It rained as usual,” Grossman
said. ”|t’s tough for me. I mean,
for some of the seniors this is it
for football. I plan to go to the
next level so it really doesn't hit
you. It's like when I played my
last game in high school, a lot of
kids were sentimental about it
and a lot of kids were down, but
 I knew I was going to college
to play some more.

’’It doesn't really affect me; I
don’t get down or anything as
long as I can still play the sport
somewhere else.”

Grossman said he plans to go
on to the professional level. He
takes with him considerable
credentials, among them being

an NFL Draft Report First Team
All-American, a member of Street
and Smith’s All-American team,
Game Plan Second Team All-
American, and Athlon All-East.

He was also named to Street
and Smith’s All—East team, The
Sporting News Second Team All-
Independent, Don Heinrich’s All-
Independent Team, and the Foot-
ball Action All-Independent
Team.

”It was. a special game,”
flanker Billy Osborn said. ”This
was a big win for us. We've been
known to lose these kinds of
games in the past. For me it was
a special win because it was
against New Jersey, and it was
my last home game. I'm just hap-
py we won. I wish I could have
contributed a little more, but the
weather [was not a] factor, and I
just went out and did what I had
to do.”

Troy Washington, Pitt's starting
free safety, seemed more reminis-
cent about his final appearance at
Pitt.

”It was a hard one.‘ I’ve been
here for five years. I never even
thought about my last game, real-
ly,” Washington said. ”Being in
the locker room before the game
starts, it was really hard for me.”

”A lot of guys, a lot of young
guys don't understand it right

Dickerson,
Richards
both gain
over 100

By Matt Martin
Sports Editor

Notes from Pitt's 20-10 victory
over Rutgers on Saturday at Pitt
Stadium:

0 Panther quarterback Darnell
Dickerson and freshman tailback
Curvin Richards combined for
310 yards on the ground,
Richards rushing for 202 yards,
his third 200—plus-yard game of
the year.

Dickerson (I 08 yards) became
the first Pitt QB to rush for more
than 100 yards since 1978, when
Rick Trocano gained 118 yards
against Temple. ‘ L

Richards joined Tony Dorsett
as the only Panther to ever gain
200 yards in three games during

PANTHER
NOTEBOOK

his freshman year. Richards has
rushed for 932 yards and is the

17th-rated running back in the
tops . among all “

country,
freshmen. ,

It was the first time since 1985
that two Panthers gained over
100 yards each.

0 Not only did the Panthers
outdistance the Scarlet Knights in
nearly every statistical category,
they crushed them.

Pitt racked up an astounding 93
offensive plays to Rutgers’ 37;
370 yards rushing to 84 yards;
time of possession — 43 minutes
to 17; 457 total yards to 201; 23
first downs to I0; the list goes on.

0 Yusef Washington continues
to improve his punting average,
which began at 27.3 yards
against Northern Iowa.

Washington punted fourltimes
for a 38-yard average, his longest
punt coming in at 46 yards.

0 Pitt wide receiver and New
Jersey native Henry Tuten said
before the game that he was
eager to prove Rutgers wrong for
not recruiting him for football.

Tuten did just that, pulling in

four of Dickerson’s six comple— -

tions for 50 yards.

0 If defensive end Burt Gross-
man has not been playing at full
tilt since an early season ankle in-
jury, then he is surely back now.

Grossman sacked Rutgers quar-
terback Scott Erney twice for a to-
tal loss of 18 yards, made four
unassisted tackles and broke up
one pass in his last home game
as a Panther.

0 The Scarlet Knights’ offense

’ kept Pitt's linebackers busy Satur-

day. Curtis Bray, Jerry Olsavsky,
Ricardo McDonald, Craig Gob
and Prentiss Wright combined for
16 tackles, one interception and
one sack.

0 As if a recurring rainstorm
were not enough, yellow flags fell
from the sky almost as often as
raindrops.

The Panthers racked up 134
yards on I4 penalties, while Rut-
gers was hit seven times for 65
yards.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, November 7, 1988

Brown, Esiason air out 42-7 win over Steelers

5-yard touchdown pass on thep,

By Joe Kay
AP Sports Writer

CINCINNATI -— Eddie Brown
turned a handful of big plays into
the biggest day ever by a Cincin-
nati Bengals receiver.

Brown rolled up a pair of
touchdowns and a c|ub—record
216 yards receiving Sunday as
the Bengals overwhelmed the
Pittsburgh Steelers 42-7 with a
big play offense.

Brown had receptions of 86,
41, 38 and 24 yards as the Ben-
gals rolled up 559 total yards. His
shortest reception was a 6—yard
touchdown that put the Bengals
in command 35-7 early in the
third quarter.

’’I look forward to the big
play,’’ said Brown, who came
into the game averaging nearly
23 yards per catch. ”That’s real-
ly the thing about this game —
make something happen. That's
what we've been doing because
we have a big-play offense.”

Brown set the tone early, com-
bining with Boomer Esiason on
an 86-yard touchdown pass on
the Bengals’ second play from
scrimmage. The Bengals went on

to score touchdowns on each of
their first three possessions.

Esiason, the triggerman in the
top-ranked offense in the Ameri-
can Football Conference, com-
pleted 16 of 23 passes, for 318
yards with three touchdown pass-
es, his first in three weeks.

The Bengals came out looking
to stretch Pittsburgh's man-to-

man defensive coverage with"

long passes.

”We said we've got to go deep,
threaten them and scare them
of,” Coach Sam Wyche said.

Esiason looked to Brown to
provide the fright. 1

”Eddie is a very explosive
receiver,” Esiason said. ”Any
time you get a receiver with that
amount of talent on a cornerback,
he's going to have a big day.”

Brown surpassed Cris Collin-.

sworth’-s club record of 206 yards
receiving in a 1983 game against
Baltimore.

The Bengals improved to 8-2
by completing their first season
sweep of the Steelers since 1985.
Pittsburgh's 2-8 record is its worst
since 1969, when the Steelers
went 1-13 in Chuck No|l’s first
year as head coach.

Noll said he was embarrassed
by the way his team was domi-
nated Sunday.

”I really haven't got much to
say,” Noll said. ”From our stand-
point, it was the worst exhibition

1/

Ilook forward to the
big play. That's really
the thing about this
game —— make some-
thing happen. That's
what we've been doing

because we have a big-  

play offense.

of football I’d seen in a long time.
The Bengals obviously played
well in every phase of the game,
and we'd have trouble with a
grade school team.”

Esiason, the top-ranked quarter-
back in the AFC, had been shut

out in touchdown passes the last
two weeks by Houston and
Cleveland. His three scoring
throws Sunday give him 20 this
season.

James Brooks capped drives
with three touchdown runs, and
rookie lckey Woods had his sec-
ond 100-yard rushing day to
balance Esiason’s passing.

Brown was the spark plug in
the passing attack. He has eight
touchdown catches and 1,015
receiving yards this season.

Brown and Esiason opened the
scoring by combining on the
third-longest pass play in Bengals’
history.

Esiason froze the Steelers’
secondary with a fake handoff,
and Brown outran cornerback
Dwayne Woodruff down the
middle of the field to make the
reception and go 86 yards un-
touched.

Pittsburgh put together its only
touchdown drive of the game on
its next possession, with quarter-
back Bubby Brister carrying the
final 9 yards.

Esiason hit Tim McGee on a
quick slant at the goal line for a

Standout penalty of the day:
offensive line coach Bill Meyers
was hit with an unsportsmanlike
conduct penalty after he argued
that Rutgers tailback Mike Botti
had stepped out of bounds on
what turned out to be a 33-yard
pass reception in the fourth
quarter. _

Rutgers scored its only touch-
down two plays later on a 1—yard
dive by James Cann.

0 A John Hancock Sun Bowl
representative was in attendance
at the game. A_Sun Bowl scout
was also at the LSU—A|abama
game.

The Sun Bowl is played Dec.
24 (Christmas Eve) in El Paso,
Texas. Last year's participants
were Oklahoma State and West
Virginia.

0 Fullback Ronald Redmon
may be the ‘most intriguing run-
ning back on the Pitt squad. Red-
mon has rushed for 85 yards on
29 carries, only a 3.0 average.

But he has become Pitt's goal
line hero, scoring all three of his
touchdowns from iwithin the
5-yard line.

0 Five Pitt players —— Gross-
man, end Carnel Smith, corner-
back Cornell Holloway and
tackles Nelson Walker and Tom
Sims — were forced to leave the
field for one play when referees
discovered they weren't wearing
required hip and tailbone pads.

”l’ve been playing without
them for three years,” Grossman
said. ”l’ve played at least 30
games and no one ever said any-
thing to me.”

0 The game may have given a
new meaning to the term ”fair-
weather fan.” The normal Satur-
day afternoon monsoon struck
again, dropping the paid atten-
dance of 42,367 to an actual at-
tendance of 20,051.

Some loose lips helped sink
Oklahoma State.

The 12th-ranked Cowboys fell
31-28 Saturday to intrastate rival
Oklahoma, ranked eighth, and a
few off-the-cuff remarks by Okla-

. homa State fullback Garrett Lim-

brick may have made the
difference.

With his team trailing 31-28
late in the fourth quarter, quarter-
back Mike Gundy marched the
Cowboys from their 9 to the Ok-
lahoma 20 and seemed poised to
put Oklahoma State in the lead.

But on third-and-two, Oklaho-

I ma State‘ful|back Garrett Lim-

brick was hit with a personal foul
call, the Cowboys were penal-
ized 15 yards, and their hopes
ended when wide receiver Brent

. Parker dropped a perfect pass in

the end zone.

No one officially confirmed the
reason for the penalty, but Lim-
brickadmitted he was heckling
Oklahoma linebacker Richard
Dillon after side judge Michael
Borgard broke up a shoving
match between the two players.

”I thought he wasn't going to
throw it [the flag] just because he
was between us,” Limbrick said.

Borgard may have thought Lim-
brick’s words were directed at
him, but officials were unavaila-
ble for comment.

Volleyball team finishes second in 5Wlm team 3095 E0
Penn State Classic over weekend

By Don Boyd

Staff Writer

The Lady Panthers rebounded
from a tough five-game loss to
Penn State on Friday evening to
defeat Big East rivals Syracuse
and Temple on Saturday en route
to a second-place finish in the
Penn State Volleyball Classic.

Pitt went into the tournament
anxious to avenge last week's
three-game sweep by Penn State
at Fitzgerald Field House.

The Lady Panthers received
strong play from outside hitters
Julie Sheils and Denise Frawley,
while extending Penn State to the
limit before losing by a 10-15,
15-10, 6-15, 15-10 and 5-15
count

Sheils led both teams with 25
kills for the match while All-
American candidate Frawley tal-

lied 20.

’’It was a great, competitive bat-
tle unlike the match in Pittsburgh,
where they beat us easily. At
times, we played some of our
best volleyball of the season,”
said Pitt coach Shelton Collier.

The matchup with Syracuse on
Saturday morning was a critical
match for the Lady Panthers be-
cause they felt a win was essen-
tial to ensure going into the Big
East Championships as the No. 1
seed.

The Syracuse Trees (Orange-
women), fielding a team with
four starters measuring 6—foot—1 or
better, jumped off to a 13-6 lead

in game one.

The Lady Panthers, behind the
inspired play of middle-blocker
Michele Adamson, culminated
an impossible comeback with a
16-14 win. The shell-shocked
Syracuse troops were dazed and
reeling, and Pitt quickly dis-
patched them, 15-4 and 15-8.

Adamson, playing some of her
strongest volleyball of the season,
led the Panthers with 14 kills.

”Syracuse is a big team and
Michele took it as a personal
challenge. She was a really big
factor in our win,” said’ Collier.

Setter Jenelle Lantagne played
one of her finest matches of the
season, staking her claim as one
of the premiere setters in the East.

”Syracuse features a good
young setter [freshman Sherry
Cowling], and the game was sig-
nificant with regards to Jenelle es-
tablishing herself in the Big East.
Cowling is good, but_ I think
Jenelle is better,” observed
Collier.

After two emotional matches,
Collier felt the Lady Panthers
needed an emotional lift for their
match against Temple. He decid-
ed to turn the Temple match over
to his freshmen and sophomores.

The strategy paid off as the
, Lady Panthers swept Temple in

three straight games (15-6, 15-8
and 15-8).

Leading the way for the Lady
Panthers were four freshmen:

‘Dee MacAuIay tallied 10 kills,

while Heather Hollands and Sue

Zonneville totaled seven, and
Bridget Gary chipped in with six.
’’I’m glad we got the chance to
play together, get some game-
time experience. We had to
know we could do ‘it ourselves,
motivate ourselves and play
smart,” noted Hollands.

Despite not capturing the tour-
ney title, Collier felt there were
some positive happenings in
State College.

”The match against Penn State
should give us some confidence
for upcoming tournaments. The
win over Syracuse was gratifying
with the Big East tournament be-
ing held in two weeks,” he said.

The Lady Panthers’ Frawley
and Lantagne were selected to
the alI—tourney team.

’’I think being a young team
with onlv two seniors, we have
gone through stages this year. I
think w-.- came together at Penn
State a' d realized that [Novem-
ber] h; 5 to be our month if we
hope 0 qualify for the NCAA
Tourv ament,” observed

"Lantagne.

Last Wednesday evening, the
Lady Panthers traveled to Akron,
Ohio to take on Youngstown
State and the University of Akron.

The two seniors on the team,
Frawley and Nora Mulvihill,
were left at home as Collier opt-
ed to develop his younger play-
ers with an eye to the future.

The results were positive for
Pitt as the Lady Panthers swept

Freshmen continued to play a
major role for the men's swim-
ming team Friday onafternoon
when Pitt soundly defeated St.
Bonaventure, 153.5 to 88.5.

The Panthers got off to a shaky
start, however. In the first event,
the 400-meter medley relay, Pitt's
teams were disqualified for swim-
ming in the wrong lanes. That
mistake gave the Bonnies a 15-0
lead.

In the second event, the 1,000
freestyle, Pitt's freshmen started
the comeback. Dave Schepner
won the event with a time of
9:46.96, and fellow freshmen
Mike Pfister and Dave Martin
finished third and fourth, respec-
tively.

Swimming coach Dick Brad-
shaw agreed that the freshmen
played a big role. ”The freshmen
really came through. Most of our
young guys were enthusiastic,
and they really made a difference
in this meet.”

Pitt freshmen took the top two
spots inl two other events. Eric
Mattson and Fred Constantini tied
for firstl in the 200 individual
medley with a time of 2:00.09.

Schepner also won the 500
freestyle for the second meet in
a row, ahead of Eric Daum.

While the freshmen set the
stage, Bradshaw went to his vete-
rans for a crucial part of the meet.
St. Bonaventure’s best three
events are the 50, 100, 200

freestyles, where they killed Pitt
last year.

”That’s where we really had to
concentrate,” said Bradshaw,
who used junior Mike Kozlina,
Pitt's best swimmer, in the 200
for the first time this year.

”Mike’s not normally a 200
freestyler, but we had to win that
event, so we put him in there.”
Kozlina won the event in
1:43.51, more than a second
faster than Garvin Ferguson of St.
Bonaventure.

In the 50 freestyle, senior Scott
Jeffries tied for the first with the
Bonnies’ Jay Triepel, who com-
peted in the NCAA Champion-
ships last year.

Jeffries was pleased with the tie
but did not feel intimidated by

Triepel, the Bonnies’ best
swimmer.

”It doesn't really matter to me.
Any one day, anybody can do
well,” he said.

Triepel did win the 100
freestyle handily, but junior Bill
Folger finished second, and
Jeffries third.

Kozlina also won the 200
meter backstroke, the event in
which he is ranked 27th in the
world. He finished in 1:54.58,
more than five seconds better
than Constantini, who easily took
second.

The men's diving team also re-
lied on its veterans to easily win
the two diving events in their first
competition of the year.

Junior John Sharkey won the A

THE Pl” NEWS, Monday, November 7, 1988

Rutgers

Continued from page 9

and, because of the rain, the Pan-
thers moved to the running game.

Rotating between scampers by
quarterback Darnell Dickerson
and running back Curt/in
Richards, the Panthers moved
down the field to the Rutgers 14.
Richards was held to one yard on
fourth down and Pitt handed the
ball over to Rutgers. The drive
lasted nearly nine minutes.

”We had plans to throw the
ball a lot more,” Gottfried said.
”The weather turned into a run
game, an option game. We just
tried to take it right at them.”

The Pitt defense held the
Knights to just three plays and a
punt on the next series. Rutgers
returned the favor, holding the
Panthers back and forcing a Yusef
Washington punt. 7

Rutgers started to move the
ball, but were snuffed at the Pitt
36 and kicked the ball back. Next
came another time—consuming
Pitt drive.

Again using primarily the run,
Pitt moved from their own 13 to
the Rutgers 17, taking a little over
eight minutes off the stadium
clock. The drive was capped by
a 33-yard Kaplan field goal.

That is the way it stood at
halftime.

”At the half, we felt we had a
very good chance to win the foot-
ball game,” Anderson said.
”They continued to keep the ball
in the second half, and we never
really had a chance to do much.”

For the game, the Panther
offense was led by Richards’ 202
yards on the ground. Richards
joined Tony Dorsett as the sec-
ond Pitt freshman to rush for over
200 yaltls [lllEE times in has
freshman season. Dickerson
rushed for 108 yards as the Pan-
thers amassed 370 yards on the
ground.

The defense was led by fresh-
man linebacker Curtis Bray, line-
backer Jerry Olsavsky and
cornerback Louis Riddick with six
tackles apeice.

’’I think this game showed a lot
of character for our team,” Ol-
savsky said. ”We pulled together
and kept them back.”

The Knights’ offense was led by

running back Mike Botti with 77

yards and QB Scott Erney with 93
yards through the air. The
defense was led by linebacker
Doug Kokoskie, who had 15
tackles.

The second half started just like
the end of the first half. Pitt
missed a 33-yard field goal on
their first drive. After the defense
held Rutgers back once again, Pitt
took over the ball at their own 33.

Another time—consuming drive
ended with Ronald Redmon run-
ning off tackle for a one-yard
touchdown run. Pitt was up 10-0.

”We were able to work
through our mistakes and get
some big plays,” Dickerson said.
”The rain took a little out of our
offense, so we just stayed on the
ground and ran the ball really
well.”

The offenses started to pick up
for both teams as the weather got
better. Rutgers came right back to
kick a 46-yard field goal to nar-
row the lead.

But the Panthers were not
finished. They completed their
fastest drive of the game, just over
three minutes, with a 9-yard
touchdown run by Richards to
pad the lead to 17-3.

”The team felt pretty good
when we started to score,”
Richards said. ’’It gave the whole
team a lift.’’

Rutgers answered with a touch-
down of their own, and the game
narrowed to 17-10.

”When they scored the touch-
down, we made a lot of mis-
takes,” Olsavsky said. ”Right
then the whole thing could have
fallen apart. They could have
kicked an on-sides kick and [got-
ten] the ball back and maybe
scored. That would have been
bad. We were lucky to hold them
out.” ‘

Pitt ate up eight minutes on
their next drive, and Kaplan hit an
18-yard field goal to finish it off.
The defense stuffed the Knights
on their next series to make the
score 20-10.

”The two biggest differences
between the teams in today's
football game were that we
turned the ball and we were not
strong enough at the line of
scrimmage,” Anderson said. ”Pitt
is a very good football team.
Their strengths were very appar-
ent today.”

”We really hurt ourselves and
couldn't make up for our mis-
takes,” Botti said. ”Pitt is a tough,
physical team. I'm surprised they
have three losses.”

The Panthers travel to State
College this Saturday to take on
arch—rival Penn State. Rutgers
returns home to face the 9-0 and
fourth-ranked West Virginia
Mountaineers.

PANTHER NOTES: Tallback
Adam Walker was healthy
enough to play during the Rutgers
game, but Gottfried felt it was
better if he had more practice

Troy Aikman threw for a touch-
down and backup tailback Brian
Brown ran 68 yards for another
score as UCLA struggled to a
Pacific-10 Conference victory.

UCLA, 5-1 in the Pac 10 and
8-1 overall, used the two second-
half touchdowns to stay in the
Rose Bowl race.

The Bruins rebounded from a
34-30 loss at Washington State
last week that knocked them out

l   Paterno goes to Lonergan in 17-10

win as Lions continue Terp ”jinx"

By Ralph Bernstein
AP Sports Writer

PHILADELPHIA — Neither
Penn State coach Joe Paterno nor
Maryland coach Joe Krivak
would accept the word jinx.

But whatever it is, Penn State
appears to hold it over Maryland.

On Saturday, Penn State waved
its magic wand and Maryland dis-
appeared for the 24th straight

time.

Penn State now leads the ser-
ies 30-1, losing only in 1961, be-
fore any of the players on either
team was born.

Penn State rallied in the final
four minutes to beat the Terra-
pins, 17-10, just when it seemed
Maryland would at least salvage
a tie.

Penn State, 5-4, rolled 74 yards

on five plays with Gary Brown

running 10 yards into the end
zone with 2:18 left to leave the
chagrined Terps at 5-4.

Although the game was played
in a windswept rainstorm, there
was only one turnover.

Krivak said he had no answer
for Maryland's famine in the
Penn State series.

"I guess this was typical of
what's happened in the past,”

/said the second-year coach of the .

Terps. .
"I don't have a reason for it, but

,maybe somewhere down the

line, what happened out there to-
day [Saturday] will make better

' people of us," he said.

"I’ll tell you this though: I don't
make any apologies for this foot-
ball team  I can answer only for
what we didout there in the last
two hours.”

Krivak said, "We could have
won that game just as easily as

we got beat. I don't think what
has happened in the past has any-
thing to do with what happened
during the last two hours.”

Paterno never mentioned the
hex his team seems to hold over
the Terrapins. He talked about an
improved running game that to-
taled 202 yards, and his decision
to switch from freshman Tony
Sacca to senior Lance Lonergan
at quarterback.

"I thought they blocked very

' well, and that's what they have to

do,” Paterno said of his running
backs, Sean Redman, Gary
Brown, Leroy Thompson and
John Greene.

"A lot of people have been crit-
ical of the offensive line, but ac-
tually our biggest fault with the
running game has been the lack
of blocking by our backs. They
have not been very good at all,
and they can be good blockers,”
Paterno said.

Brown carried 17 times for 102
yards, Redman eight for 57, all in
the game-opening drive to a field
goal, and Thompson 11 for 42.

"I thought Brown and Thomp-
son ran hard and had their best
game," Paterno said.

Paterno has been starting Sac-
ca at quarterback since the inju-
ry to Tom Bill in the second half
of the third game of the season.

For Maryland, he switched to
Lonergan, who had been out un-
til the second half of last week's
loss to West Virginia.

Lonergan completed only six of
19 passes, buthe played a key

.. role in Saturday's victory.

He threw a screen pass to full-
back John Greene that covered
79 yards for a first-period touch-
down, and also set up the game-
winning score with a 45-yarder to

Dave Daniels for a first at the
Maryland 18.

Maryland had two chances to
win the game in the final period.
With the scored tied at 10, Dan
Plocki was short on a 43-yard
field goal attempt with 4:12 re-
maining.

After Penn State had gone
ahead, 17-10, the Terps drove
from their 34 to a first down at the
State 15. But three pass plays and
a run netted two yards, and the
Lions took over with 55 seconds
left. A 31-yard pass from Neil
O'Donnell to Vernon Jones set
up the threat.

Paterno, who kept secret until
game time his choice of quarter-
back, said he told Sacca on Mon-
day that he was going to
Lonergan.

"It was time for Lonergan,"
said Paterno of the backup
quarterback

"I told Tony [Sacca] I was go-
ing with Lance, and said he ought
to be proud of the job he's done.
I told him I had put more pressure
on him than anyone I've ever
coached."

Paterno said that Daniels was
a secondary receiver on the key
pass that set up the winning TD.

"Lonergan made a great deci-
sion. That wasn't where the pass
was supposed to go," Paterno
said.

Miami
world
class?

By Steven Wine
AP Sports Writer

MIAMI —- In ceremonies be-
fore the Miami Heat's first
game in the NBA, actor Don
Johnson bragged to the crowd
about the TV shows, music
and football produced by the
city.

"Now we've got a world
class basketball team to boot!"
the Miami Vice star said
Saturday.

Then, the Los Angeles Clip-
pers, 3-38 on the road last
year, beat the Heat 111-91.

"We’ve got a long way to.
go,” Miami's Ron Rothstein
said after his first game as an
NBA head coach.

Miami fell behind 30-13 ear-
ly in the second quarter,
trailed 74-52 in the third peri-
od and was never closer than
14 points in the fourth quarter.

"The commissioner set us
up,” Clippers guard Norm
Nixon said with a smile. "I bet
you the commissioner sent us
down here because they figure
this was a game Miami could
win. They didn't want to send
the Lakers down here, or
Detroit.”

1-meter event and senior Vernon
Yenick finished second. In the
3-meter event, Yenick finished
first and Sharkey second.

Diving coach Julian Krug was
pleased with the results but said
he was not really concerned with
scores this early in the season.

"We simply needed to get our
feet wet. We are not really point-
ing for these meets at all. We real-
ly want to do well at theother
end of the year,” Krug said.

This was evident in the simplic-
ity of many of the dives. "We've
really worked hard only on the
basics. We're just now starting to
go with full lists [ofdives]. Every-
body did what I wanted to see
overall mechanically,” Krug
added.

Krug was especially pleased
with the results of Phil Cruz, who
finished fifth in the 1-meter and
sixth in the 3-meter.

Cruz is a freshman who literal-
ly just walked in off the street a
week after classes started and
asked if he could have a tryout.
Cruz, from Long Island, N.Y., im-
pressed Krug and a few days later
registered as a student and joined
the team.

"The boy has done an awe-
some job of learning. He doesn't
have much of a diving back-
ground at all, but he's going to be
a whale of a diver,” Krug said.

In other events, Pitt also won
the 200 meter butterfly. John Kes-
ler, a sophomore, finished first
with a time of 1:58.76, and
another freshman, Ross Blan-
chard, finished second.

The Panthers also won the 400
meter freestyle relay. The team of
Jeffries, Daum, Folger and Kesler
finished with a time of 3:12.34.

The Panthers’ next meet is this
Friday against Clarion State at

Trees Hall Pool.

both Akron and Youngstown
State in three games.

Freshmen Gary and Zonneville
led the way for the Panthers as
they ranked one and two respec-
tively for the evening in kills.

"Bridget Gary was the star of
the evening. She was not just ef-‘
fective but was dominant at ‘
times,” noted Collier.

"Sue Zonneville played very
well, also. She dominated in
those matches,” he added.

Gary felt the Akron and Young-
stown State matches were an op-
portunity to prove herself.

"We were playing, and we
weren't playing together <0 Shel-
ton put me in. It was I. , oppor-
tunity to show I could play
volleyball,” she said.

Zonneville started in both

games and used the experience 
to her advantage at Penn State. 1

"Going into the Temple game,
I felt real [confidence] in my
teammates’ ability to play their
positions, which gave me confi-
dence in my ability to play well,”
observed Zonneville.

With four wins in five outings
last week, the Lady Panthers’
record is currently 19-7.

This week, Pitt travels to
Kalamazoo, Mich., to take part in

the Western Michigan Volleyball 

Classic against the host Hurons,
Arizona State and the University
of Texas at Arlington on Friday
and Saturday.

The Lady Panthers’ next home.
encounter will occur when they
host the Big East Championships
on Nov. 19 and 20.

on. ‘

"|t's been five.great years. If I
could do it all over, I would still
come to the University of Pitts-
burgh. You ‘meet so many great
people here. Coach Gottfried

brings so many great people to

talk to you. They give you an’
even broader aspect of life, not
just on football, but on the out-
side life too, and it's really been
great playing here," Washington
‘said.

Of his last game at Pitt, guard
Mark Stepnoski said, "I was glad
we could finish out with a win.
It was nice to get this game; this
was a must game for us. I'm just
glad I could finish this way."

Stepnoskistood out as well, be-
ing named All-American by NFL
Draft Report (First Team), College
and Pro Football Newsweekly
(First Team), Football Digest,
Football Action, Street and
Smith's and The Sporting News,
in which he was rated the No. 2
guard, just to name a few of the
many preseason honors Step-
noski received.

Fans also took their last look at
several other Panther players,
among them injured starting tack-
le Tom Ricketts, starting corner-
back Cornell Holloway, starting
tight end Vernon Kirk, corner-
back Michael Hadley, center
John Glesky, linebacker Marc
Mandel, cornerback Chris Ross
and wide receiver Lee McRae.
