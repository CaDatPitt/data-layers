School BusKills Child;

Driver Freed on Bond

A 7-year-old boy, Leon Ladd, of 410 Robinson Street, was
struck and killed by the University bus yesterday at 12:45 p.m.

Raymond Allen, the bus driver, was charged. by police with
manslaughter and freed on $1000 bond. -'

Allen, 25, of 1562 McFarland Road, was turning the bus

around at Gate 3 of the Stadium
when the accident occurred, accord-
ing to police.

Unaware of Boy

Before he was releasedfrom No.4
police station, Allen_ told police,
“I swear to God there was nobody
around. I don't know where the kid
came from. I had just backed in,
and was going to pull out, when I
heard a thud. I jumped out of the
bus and there was this kid lying
by the left front wheel. I don't
know where he came from.” C

_A passing truck driver ran into
the Stadium and called an ambu-
lance, but the boy had apparently
been killed instantly. He was pro-
nounced dead on arrival at Presby-

/terian Hospital.

       

One Passenger’

Yussif Ibrahim, a»student from
India attending Pitt, was the only
passenger on the bus at the time of
the accident.

He told a shocked group of stu-
dents waiting for the bus to Ells-
worth Center that the bus would
not be coming because it had run
over a little boy.

Allen told police he thought the
boy must have been hanging on to
the front of the bus somehow. He
said he always toots his horn com-
ing up Stadium Road because a
bunch of little boys usually try to
hitch rides up the hill.

Takes Different Route

The bus usually turns around at
Trees Gym, but since the gym was
closed Allen said he had been turn-
ing at the Stadium.

No date has been set for a coro-
ner’s inquest into the accident.

The bus was used only by the
athletic department last year. Early
this semester, regular service be-
tween Ellsworth Center, the Cathe-
dral and Trees Gym was estab-
lished. It was also used for trips
to Schenley Park by thecross-coun-
try team and intramuralptouch foot-

Southern Flies
Buzzing Toward

Pitt Spider Wetb

Seldom does one heat of a fly
inviting itself into the spider’s
parlor, but according to a letter
recently received by the Panther
magazine staff from Providence
Hospital School of Nursing in
Mobile, Alabama, the deep South
is sending forth» a definite buzzing
sound, complete with drawl.

The letter, an S.O.S. for pro-
motion ideas, came as a result of
the Panther’s lst issue circulation
problem. At that time, the student
magazine was offering double
money back to recall enough issues
for checking copies.

Betty Kelleher, editor of the
student publication, ‘The Labour-
ean,” wrote that it “sounds too
good to be true” and asked to be
put on the Panther’s exchange
list.

This request of the “Labour-
ean,” a news magazine reflecting
the life and activities of student
nurses ina Catholic hospital, can-
not but produce the feeling that
the exchange rnight.be beneficial
for the Pa-nther-staff, but after
once the girls see the Panther, it
just can't last.

Committee ‘May Meet
This Week for Talks

‘By MYRON KOPELMAN
Pitt News Sports Editor
The renewal of Head Football Coach Mike Milligan’s ‘contract
is expected to undergo consideration by the Athletic Committee

either this week or next.

His three-year contract expires in February.
The committee, which generally meets at least once a month,

Profs Exceed
Chest Quota

Although the Pitt Community
Chest drive fell behind its goal
by over $2400, the University Fac-
ulty has once again oversubscribed
*its goal. The assigned quota for
the faculty this year was $7,327
and a total of $9,376 has been
pledged.

Dr. '].G. Quick, University reg-
istrar, stated, "For the Community
Chest, and the faculty committee,
I am happy to express hearty con-
gratulations to all who helped.
This generous response is an in-
dication of the sincere concern of
the faculty for the welfare of the
thousands who must rely upon the
agencies supported by the Com-
munity Chest.”

Pledges amounting to 128 per
cent of the faculty objective were
brought in by the faculty’s 38 soli-
citors. "This is by far the best
record ever made in a Chest drive
among the faculty,” Dr.Quick said.

Y Program
Takes Poll

Plans for Religion-in-Life Week,
Jan. 15-19, are moving into high
gear, according to Al Payne, co-ex-
ecutive of the Week planning.

A poll of over 900 students of
all faiths has been taken on various
aspects of the theme "Design for
Living.” The results of the poll
will be made public next Friday.

A complete list of speakers for
classrooms, seminars, and discus-
sions before fraternity and sorority
groups has been drawn up. Included
on the list are 12 visiting speakers,,
men important ‘in civic life who
have agreed to spend five days
with the students of the University.

Mrs. Edna T. Batz, co-executive
with Mr. Payne, has reported that
the demand for speakers in class-
rooms has been great enough to
warrant using all the speakers

"The thing that thrills me most,”
says Mr.Payne,” is the tremendous
spirit and willingness to work to-
wardaworthy goal shown by faculty
and students alike. The people who
have planned and worked for six
months on Religion-in-Life Week
have reaped an enormous benefit, if
only for the understanding and
ability to cooperate which they
have gained.

"If the spirit and willingness of A

the planners is anyindication, then
this Religion-in-Life Week will be
a resounding success.”

Trees Gym

Padloc ked

Bulletin

The intramural office has an-

nounced that all basketball games ‘

have been called off until the first
of the year. Leo Bemis, [M head,
will contact all managers to re-
vise schedules.

 

Trees Gym was temporarily con-
demned and padlocked last Thurs-
day because construction on the
Veteran’s Hospital behind the gym
disturbed the foundation. The build-
ing has tilted about three inches,
according to Dr. John Weber, Uni-
versity secretary. ‘ .

An abandoned pre-Civil War_ coal
mine 100 feet below the hill behind
the gym is being pumped full of li-
quid cement to insure a firm base
for the 17-story hospital.

The cement was forced through
the underlying rock strata, cracking
the boiler-roomifloor and causing
cracks in the walls, according to
Leo Bemis, intramural sports direc-
tor whose offices are in the building.

A small lake of seepage water
has flooded the street in front of
the gym. .

Dr. Weber ordered the building
padlocked until after the Christmas
holidays to prevent the possibility

6 of accidents tostudents from fall-

ing plaster.

He said, "We got a scare last
Saturday when cracks in the walls
were aggravated in the gym and
around the indoor track. The pres-
sure from the pumps was reduced
from 100 lbs.to10 lbs. and the gym
was closed over the weekend.”

When the cracks got worse Thurs-
day,the gym was locked up and the
pumps were moved to the far side
of the field to reduce the threat of
further disturbance. _

Asked if the gym would definite-
ly be re-opened after the vacation,
Dr. Weber replied, “My only con-
cern is that the students not be ex-
posed to any danger. The cement
work will be finished during the
holidays and we will investigate
again before classes resume.”

Gym students should consult cam-
pus bulletin boards when classes
start again in January to find out if
the gym has be en re-opened.

Trees gym is government property‘.
It was sold to the Veteran's Admin-
istration which plans to use the
swimming pool as part of its new
hospital. It was the site of Pitt’s
basketball games before the sta-
dium gym was built.

The University bus is wearing a
coat of mud. acquired in repeated
passage through the pool of water
in front of the gym.

Band ’s 3 rd Annitalﬂeview Tonight

By ALLAN BIERMAN
Way back in 1947, two men got
together on an idea suggested by
some of the more outspoken mem-
bers of the public.

They were Robert L. Arthur, di-,

rector of University bands, and Cap-
tain James D. Hunter, drill coach
for the band.

The idea was to have the Var-
sity Marching Band present an in-
door show retaining the color and
flash of the stadium performances.

Concocts Review

After much discussion, the men
came up with the first "Stadium Re-
view.”
v ‘Tonight the band will

To give the audience a sample of
their “marching magic" the band
will make its entrance fromthe rear
of the auditorium.

The music on the program con-
sists of the music played for the
pre-game and half-time formations
plus several marches and special-
ties.

Drum Major Jim Andrews and
Scotch Drummer Pete Pateas will
get together for a jive dance rou-
tine.

Chairman Dr. Norman C. Ochsen-
hirt told the Pitt News that a meet-
ing will be held “before Christ-
mas.”
No Comment

Dr. Ochsenhirt would not say
whether the subject of contract
renewal will be taken up. "I can’t

MIKE MILLIGAN

tell whether we will get to it,”
he said. "There are othermatters
scheduled to be considered.”

However, since most expiringi
contracts are handled shortly after ’
the close of the football season,
veteran observers are assuming
that a contract will be drawn up
and presented. They expect it to
be a short—term contract.

Salary Estimated

Milligan’s present salary has
been variously estimated at $8,000
to $10,000.

Committee members who will,
take part in the meetingare: Dr.
Lawrence E. Van Kirk, dean of .
the Dentistry’ School; Robert X."

department. 0 ' ,

Dr. Ochsenhirt; Attorney John
Nicklas; Attorney Ira Hill, and
Dario Icardi, student represent-
ative.

, _ Took Over in:'47
Milligan took over as head coach

of the Panthers in 1947. His first
year in the driver's seat was dis-
astrous, the Panthers winning
only one game in nine starts. But
his team came backache next year
to give Pitt its best record in ten_ f
years, with six wins and three-
losses. ‘

The 1948 record was duplicated,
this past year.

Milligan’s first coaching job at
Pitt was in l934r*when he suc-
ceeded Dr. Skip Gougler as coach
of the freshman team. He also
worked with the varsity guards.

In 1938 he went to the University
of Florida to become line coach.
In 1941 he shifted to Tulsa to
assist Head Coach Henry Frnka.

Milligan nas always been a,
stout disciple of the single wing,
although he has added a few frills
to the offense during the past
three seasons.

Next Year Notiz  

Spring of 1951 may be more than a year away on most calen-
F dars, buton the one we're considering it’s already on top of us.
We're -thinking ofthe calendar University officials will soon be
preparing-for the 1950-51 school year. So our timing really isn't
hso bad. If anything we have to say about next year’s schedule is
to have any effect, we have to say it now. In another few months
I it would bejust so many wasted words.
I The spring semester, as it has been set upduring recent years,
has compared too much to a long, dry textbook’. Once we start into
it in February, there’s practically nothing to break up the monoto-
"nous weeks except an all-too-brief respite around Easter. Find a
 scholar who sprinklesa little humor relief into his learned writing
and you'll find his material much easier to digest in large doses.
We’re surethat in saying this we arerecording the majority
pinion of the student body. Maybe the students don’t realize why
the spring semester drags so much more than the fall period, but
they know it does. Some pin the blaine on "spring fever.” Others
ink perhaps it-’s because they start too soon to anticipate the
pleasures of the summer vacation.
‘ But we're certain that it is that almost solid period from Feb-
ruary to June that bogs the students down halfway through it.
Just what do we propose be done about it? We suggest that
he. Easter vacation be lengthened to. a week, giving the second
emester something similar to the Christmas “leave” during the
fall period. We urge this even if it means" tacking a few extra
days on at the end of the semester or, perhaps, shortening the
‘between-semesters break. «
, We realize full well that the University has state requirements
to meet with regard to the number of days in its school year. And
we recognize~the-"bookkeeping” demand placed on the registrar's
office in clearing up the first semesterland getting ready for the
next, although most of this work is now being done by machine
instead of by hand. We do believe that the officials involved in
‘the "operation” of the calendar should recognize this flaw in

    
  
   
        
  
   
   
   
   
  
  
    
   
  
   
 
  
  
   
   
    
    
   
 
 
    
  
   
   
  
     
   
  
   
  
  
  
   
  
  
  
  
 

students in years to come.

Apparently other schools ofcomparable size and location have
seen the same problem and attempted to solve it. Ohio State, with
an even -larger enrollment than Pitt, operates a schedule with
three regular semesters. It is so set up that, rather than having
he Christmas ‘and between-semester holidays falling within a
month of each other as at Pitt, one semester break falls at Christ-
mas, the other in March. At Temple and Penn, vacations of six
weekdays fall at Easter-time.

We are getting more time off (three days) this Easter than in
in the past three years. The spell between the fall and spring
’semesters_has b-eenvshaved to a single week, probably as far as
the registrar's officevcan go and still get everything ready for
spring registration. i I , A I

But that doesn’t refute the proposal. TheUniversity is inter-
_ested in the efficiency of its instructional machine and we feel
that this minor adjustment will assist along that line.

Storm Center

With the Commons Room dance project regrettably postponed
until spring, this writer would like to turn his attention to a sub-
ject of even more concern to students,faculty, and future students
of the University who haven’t even been born yet, namely the
long-promised, almost mythical Student Center.

This is the opening gun in-an
admitted crusade which will, as
often as space permits, appear
somewhere on this page from now
until June, 1951, when someone
else will have to take over, if nec-
essary. .

Perhaps it would be well to draw
up some sort of platform, so that

tion, Board of Trustees. and in‘
terested students can look back
to" this for reference when the final
plans are released to the city
papers.
Here,then, are a few of the things
most students would like to see in
their ‘indoor campusz’ \
A dance floor big enough to hold
all-but the major dances, such as
the Military Ball. ,

Office and meeting room space
for student organizations.

A lounge and snack bar.

Some recreational facilities, such

as ping-pong tables, and maybe
even a couple of bowling alleys.

The needfor a dance floor doesn’t
need any elaboration, so let's look
at the second point.

At present, the activities of stu-
dent organizations are hamstrung,
just as many faculty and adminis-
tration offices are cramped, due to
the lack of adequate space in the
Cathedral.

We’re not complaining, however,
We know that there just isn't space,‘
and that Ph. D’s are forcedto play
kneesies in their cubbyhole offices
uprstairs. But the last copy of the
Student Center plans we saw made
no allowance for publications facil-
ities, and provided for woefully in-
adequate meeting rooms intended
for use by all of the various clubs,
committees, and other student or-
ganizations on campus.

About two months ago, a set of
plans were shown to some of the

student activities leaders, who
found it hard to keep ‘from being
agonizingly sick, since they, too,
had been, fed with dreams of a
center comparable with those at
other universities.

The dance floor was of the ‘post-
age stamp variety, what few meet-
ing rooms existed were cramped,
and a tremendous amount of space
was given over to food service
facilities.

“Limited facilities are better
than none at all,” was the answer
given to complaints,'but in this
case the old cliche doesn’t apply.

Any building erected as a stu-
dent center will remain, with little
modification, for the next 150 years,
barring an atomic bomb. Therefore,

' if improvements and changes aren't

made while the building is in the
paper stage, they’ll never be made,
and students in each succeeding
year will curse more heartily at
the people who permitted such a
building to go up. .
Rumor has it that new plans have
been drawn. If they have, some one
is making awfully certain that no
student gets a chance to gripe
about them. ‘

It seems ironic to me, that within

could be so bl- ind as to believe
that "discrimination has not pre-

can’t be just an "accident” that

Americans.”

I am surprised at Ray Maher,
(obviously a very ‘learned collea-
gue) who in so many words refers
all those who desire a frat that
does not discriminate to direct
their attention to Alpha Phi Alpha.

As a brother of Alpha I am proud
of course to be a part of a truly
democratic frat. But I am not so
selfish as to command a monopoly
of true democracy for our frater-
nity, for I feel personally that the

cedure of being better Americans.
And with this may I go on record
as being bitterly opposed to any
"Gentlemen’s Agreement” or other-

thriving by closing its doors to
other Americans because of race,
color or religion. To my mind
fraternities may choose any num-
ber of excuses or reason for not
admitting a student into its brotherly
folds,’ but none can justify use of
race, color, or religion as one of
them.

I am in complete agreement with
P.N’s news editor for his demo-
cratic stand on this issue.There is
definitely a conscious bias in our
college fraternal life and it’s high

sal of the advisory opinion.

Justices Emeritys Theodore W.
Biddle and Edwin" J.McIntosh, ably
assisted by Presiding Chief Justice
Carlton Knox and associate Jus-
tices Alan Goldberg and Joseph
Wolfe. ~

Adding to the ridiculousness of
the situation, officials of the frosh
orientation program-expressed the
wish that all freshmen recognize
‘the gravity of the program and the
subject under discussion and act
accordingly.

Instead of allowing the dink pro-
gram to die gracefully, Upperclass
Court has elected to continue the
farce. . I

The whole affair has the makings
of a good comic opera. All that is
lacking to complete the comedy
are the white wigs and the black
robes and appropriate‘ music. Upper-
class Court has thoughtfully pro-
vided the other semi-cpmic charac-
ters such as asergeant-at-arms and
a bailiff. What we need now is the
Gilbert and Sullivan combination to
supply the music.

Whatever Upperclass Court is
trying to accomplish seems slightly
obscure at this point. Freshmen
this year, although younger than the
post-war crop of students,certainly
aren’t any different because of the

to all intents and purposes centered A
‘around the dink-wearing rule. If the
-whole orientation program was de-
signed to instill the younger fresh-
men with the old school spirit, it
failed from the start, and Upper-
class Court should have let it go at
that.

4 But no, they continued the side
show by hauling a wayward, fresh-
man to court, and in a semi-mock
trial accused him of not wearing
his dink and having a generally
antagonistic attitude towards the
orientation program.

And now to have that august
body, Upperclass Court, rule that
none of the freshmen are’worth‘y of
receiving Panther Keys because
none ofthem complied fully with the
dink-wearing edict seems out of
order.

However, the Messrs. Knox and
Wolfe, of the Pitt Comic Opera
Association must take action be-
cause of the high positions they
hold. After all, haven’t the frosh»
desecrated our ivy covered tradi-
tions by deliberately flaunting the
Upperclass Court rulings? The old
school spirit has taken a jolt, ‘you
know.

So, remember frosh, when you
receive your compulsory summons .
to attend the trial, we hope that you
realize the gravity and solemnity
of the occasion. We hope you real-
ize that in the eyes of Upperclass
Court you are not worthy of receiv-
ing Panther Keys. And remember
also that refreshments will be
served in the Commons Room immed-

fre shman orientation program, which

still not worth eight cents. "

The Panther Cub, newspaper
of Pitt’s Johnstown Center, has
started a junior campaign of their
own, condemning eight cent brew.
(Their coffee was just hiked up
from a nickel.) Both faculty and
students, according to the Cub,
are hiking to outside eateries or
buying milk which sells for eight
cents.
vilt seems strange thatJohnstown
Center could charge five cents
much longer than the price’ was in
effect here. It is also strange that
milk is still eight cents there,
while in the Cathedral, it is ten
cents.

Perhaps Miss Cramblet is still
losing spoons at the rate of 13
dozen a week (as she reported last
year) or perhaps Johnstown Center
has more customers and can afford
to charge a lower price.

ecker, dean of the Division of Re-
search in the Natural Sciences.

Lauffer Named
Dr./Max A. Lauffer, formerly re-

search professor of physics, has
been named head of the new de-
partrnent. At present, the depart-
ment is located in Thaw Hall, but
plans are being made to place it
in the George H. Clapp Hall, the
proposed new science building of
the University. -

Initially, the departmental staff
will include Dr. Lauffer, an assis-
tant professor and several senior
research fellows and assistants.

The science of biophysics uses
the known methods and concepts
of the physical sciences to investi-
gate and interpret the functions
and activity of living organisms.

Grad Courses Given-

Classes and research in the de-

partment are now open only to grad-
uate students. A biophysics cur-
riculum leading to a Ph.D.has also
been set up. Undergraduate courses
are a possibility for the future.

The new department’s major func-
tions will be research in biophysics;
graduate training, and service to
other branches, particularly the
College, School of Medicine, and
th-e Graduate School of Public
Health. Initial research will in-
vestigate the biological character-
ization of viruses.

Research Begun
The research program of the new

department is concerned with three
fundamental problems: (l)the ident-
ification of biological activity with
physical make-up in viruses, (2)
the correlation of the biological
activity of a specific substance
with the chemical and physical
properties of that substance, and
(3) the determination of whether
or not proteins combine chemically
or physically witlrwater in the
living cell. _

Courses in biophysics were given
formerly under the department of
physics, but the fact that they are
two distinct sciences made bio-
physics virtually a separate de-
partment. The announcementiof the
establishment of the biophysics de-
partment makes the separation
formal and complete.

Xmas Spirit

Prevails in
Commons

Decorated Christmas trees, roar-
ing fireplaces, and the sound of
carols every hour will create back-
ground for t-he Commons Room
parties the rest of this week.

Sponsored by Commons Room
Council, the Christmas program
includes a party with different re-
freshments every day.

Today will feature a double bill
of parties. The annual Faculty
Party, with coffee and donuts for
refreshments, will be in session
on the Forbes Street side of the
Commons Room, while the Pitt
Singers party is going strong On
the Fifth Avenue side. Pitt Singers
will sing for their tea in a special
program at 3:30. .

Tomorrow, music will again fill
the Commons Room when Women’s
Choral and Men’s Glee Club merge
for a combined party.

Thursday’s Christmas program
will be handled by Men’s Council
and is open to the whole school.
At the party, Panther keys will be
awarded to freshmen who have co-
operated fully with the Council
program. '

Friday will be the final party.
At 3:30 all students are urged to
come to the Commons Room where
they will be greeted by Santa Claus
portrayed by Dr. Edwin Peterson.
Santa will distribute presents to
organizations, classes, faculty,

When the "Christmas Issue” of the Panther magazine goes on sale-
tomorrow morning, the Chi Omega sorority will be defending the gold.
Panther Cup. They won temporary possession of this award by selling

more of the "Cold Turkey” issues than any other sorority. -

The Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority

did not succeesfully defend it
against the Chi Omegas. With the
"Christmas Issue” they will be
trying to win it back.

The cup is given at each issue

Panthers. The sorority selling the
most Panthers during the entire
year will win permanent possession
of the cup.

Carol llinds got in the running
for the $25 prize for individual sales.
This cash prize is given at the end
of the year to the individual who

3)’ WILL DOERGE -.

As usual, Pitt’s basketball of-
fense this year is built around the
fast break and the lay up shot. The
set shot is fast becoming extinct
in the Pitt system. .

There still are times, though,
when the set shot has to be taken
(usually when everything else)
fails). So it is handy to have some-
one around who can pop in an oc-
casional long one. ’

This year Pitt's set shot artist
promises to be Mike Belich, asharp-
shooting junior from Duquesne.

Replaces David

Belich, a letter winner last year
who has advanced to a regular for-
ward starting position, has been
unerring in his shots from the out-
side. He’ll be taking over in that
department where Sammy David
left off, and should rank high in
total scoring.

The smallest of the small Pan-
thers at 5-8 (so he says), Mike is
also the oldest at 25. But neither
his height nor his age has proven a
handicap to him so far.

Belich figures to be one of the
privileged few on Dr. H.C. Carlson’s
basketball squad who is at liberty
to take a set shot when a reason-
able opening occurs. Along with
Captain George McCrossin, the.
Towanda Terror, and Pesty Hrom-
anik, he will handle practically all
of the Panthers’ efforts from the
outside.

’ Doc's Reasons

Contrary to the Pitt fans’ idea
that Carlson pulls a player from
the lineup who tries a long shot,
Belich explains, "It’s all right
as long as the player has a rea-
sonable chance of making the shot.
Doc can tell if you’re shooting or
just throwing the ball away.”

Mike doesn't get much chance to .
loop his favorite shot at the basket
here at Pitt. In his pre-Pitt days,

MIKE BELICH
Dead from the outside

Mike was dead on all one-handed
push shots from the foulcircle.

But under the Carlson system,
the center lane is rarely open for a
push shot.

Mainly a Shooter

Belich is primarily a shooter,
and previous teams he played on
built their offense around his abil-
ity at popping in the ball. He was
consistently a high scorer. °

Mike is a natural ball player,
though, and was quick to pick up

the new style at Pitt. “Team play
is the important thing in this sys-
tem,” says Belich, and now that
I've played it, I like it better than
any other.”

He won All-WPIAL honors at Du-
quesne High in 1943, played ser-
vice ball with the Second Air Force,
and before entering Pitt, became
well known in independent ranks
here for his basketball prowess.

Belich sparked the Pitt freshmen
in 1947. A

Three Close Matches Figure
In Grapplers’ 20-6 Defeat

Three decisions, which they won by point margins, figured promi-
HCHIIY 1nGettysburg’s 20-6 Victory over the Pit: wrestlers at the Stadium

Saturday in the season opener.
The Gettysburg Bullets, a well
balanced team, found that a slim
margin separated victory from de-
feat in the 136-pound, the 145-
pound, and 155-pound divisions.
Gettysburg’s J im Woods squeezed
by Frank Clark, 3-2 on one point
riding time to win the decision in
the 136-pound bout. In another
match, in which
neither grappler
received, points
for riding time,

the Bullet 145-
pounder, Dick
Sassman, nosed

out lanky Frank

win.

Pitt Swimmers

Get No Tanks;

Trees Pool Gone

APitt swimmerand a disappointed
office-seeker now have something
in common -- no pool. A

With the final cracking up of
ancient Trees Gym, the tankers
find themselves without a site to
practice. During the past week
Coach Ben Grady has’ taken his team
across Bellefield Avenue to the

.YMHA pool.

Still another worry for Grady is
the lack of a site for his scheduled
dual meets. All home meets had
been assigned to the Trees pool.

Now with the probability that
Trees will be permanently out of
use,the distraught Grady finds him-
self without anything that will hold
water.

Phi Gams
Win Cup  

Phi Gam fraternity was awarded
the coveted all-point trophy last
Friday night at the IF Ball.

The Fijis, in a close race all
year with the Phi Eps, won the
cup on the basis of point accumu-
latipn during the 1948-49 school
year. Points were given for athletic
and scholastic prowess.

Ray Maher, president of IF Coun-
cil, presented “the trophy. The Phi’
Gams had a point total of 356
points. Second place Phi Eps. had

Faction Tactics Lie Ahead

By MYRON KOPELMANv
Sports Editor

A factional battle between the nation's schools must take place
before Chancellor Rufus H. ‘Fitzgerald's proposal for a_ nationally
uniform athletic code can be realized. The Chancellor conceded
this in an interview with the Pitt News. A

Dr. Fitzgerald’s theory, which advocates that all memberschools
of the National Collegiate Athletic Association follow one specific
plan for eligibility and aid to athletes, would doubtless cause many
high school ball players to matriculate close to home.

They could receive no better offers from other sections. There-
fore, schoolswhich draw greatly from talent in distant sections

would in all probability object to
the plan. '

Needs Power

Dr. Fitzgerald, formerly a grid
coach, agreed that the uniform code
would first have to boast a powerful
group of subscribers. Then the dis-
senters would gradually have to
join the group. .»

He pointed out that his plan was
not an object of University policy
but merely an expression of his
own opinion.

“College athletics must have
one concrete set of eligibility and
scholarship aid rules,” declared
the Chancellor, "just as there is
one rulebook for playing the games.”

Once the degree of aid, for exam-
ple, is established, member schools
would be permitted to offer no more
nor less, he stated.

Need Central Government
"What we need,” he added "is a
central governing office similar to
the ones in professional baseball
and professional football. If one
school questioned the actions of
another, it would protest directly

to that office. .
"An upheld protest would result

in a definitely prescribed penalty
just as a violation in a football

   
   
  
  
   
    
    
  
 
  

game is penalized.”

"Caste” is a comedy of manners

period.

The play marks the turning point
between the former conventional
and romantic theater and the mod-
ern realistic theater of today.
Harvey ]. pope, director, is steer-
ing the actors toward an interpre-
tation of their parts that will re-
flect the blend of both these ele-
ments, old and new, as does the
play as a whole. _

It is the kind of comedy that calls
for real guffaws from the audience,
according to Bill Bode, associate
director.

CARBON MONOXIDE...
FRIEND OF MAN

EST

Thanks to high-pressure synthesis, it now leads a useful life

To the man on the street, carbon
monoxide is just a poisonous gas that
sometimes causes tragic deaths when
it escapes from the exhaust of an
automobile or from a poorly tended
furnace.

Outside of the chemical ﬁeld, few
people are aware that, properly used,
it is a very real friend of man. In the
last 25 years, during which catalytic

make 3,5 ,5-trimethylhexanol.

and high-pressure chemical tech-
niques have been highly developed,
carbon monoxide has become a key-
stone of industrial synthesis.
Scientists have found that under
the proper conditions of high press-
ure and temperature, carbon mon-
oxide, in combination with other
substances, can be converted to a
variety of useful products. These or
their derivatives range from an acid
used in tanning hides to the spar-
kling plastics in milady’s boudoir.

You’d hardly associate carbon mon-
oxide with anti-freeze. But at tem-
peratures from 300 to 450°C. and
under pressures of 1500 to 15,000
pounds per square inch, carbon mon-
oxide and hydrogen unite to form
methanol——a colorless liquid from
which is made “Zerone” anti-rust
anti-freeze for automobiles. From
methanol and carbon monoxide as
raw materials, ethylene glycol for
“Zerex” anti-freeze is produced.

Plastics and Anti-Freeze

Methanol is used also to make a
large number of compounds such as
formaldehyde and methyl metha-
crylate. The former goes into urea-
and phenol-formaldehyde plastics for
light ﬁxtures, radio cabinets, hard-
ware, utensils, and electrical equip-
ment. The latter is the basic mate-
rial for “Lucite” acrylic resin with
its many uses.

’42 checking a multi-stage carbon monoxide
compressor used in semi-works operations.

The reaction of methanol with
carbon monoxide leads to acetic acid,
which is a well-known industrial
chemical. By the same synthesis but
substituting ethanol for methanol,
propionic acid is obtained. From it
come the “Mycoban” sodium and
calcium propionates that retard
mold and rope in bakery products.

pressures. However, the possibilities
have by no means been exhausted.
Just recently, for example, chemists
have been learning how to use car-
bon monoxide in “upgrading” cer-
tain petroleum hydrocarbons to give
interesting alcohols. One of these,
3,5,5-trimethylhexanol, is prepared
from diisobutylene by reaction with
carbon monoxide and hydrogen.

College-trained men and women
interested in working in this ﬁeld at
Du Pont may share in discoveries as
outstanding as any yet achieved.

Because of the wide scope of
Du Pont’s activities, young graduates
in many different ﬁelds have oppor-
tunities to select the careers that
prove to suit them best as their abili-
ties and interests develop.
