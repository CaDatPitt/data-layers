The last ‘regular cénvocation of
the Woman's Activities Association
of the University took: the form'»of
a Pow=-Wfow. After the regular an-
nouncements the meeting ,was thrown
open to the women for the "discussion
.of certain disputed and problematic
questions in regard to the school as
a. whole. _ A I '

Lena Ebeling introduced the sub
loci; of self-government for" women
and made the point that as apmeans
for accomplishing deﬁnitely organized
work on the part of the women of
the University, it would be the most
effectual, since through it could be
solved many of the problems
school life. _

Majorie Stewart made her “little
'growl" concerning the position of
women instructors here at the Univer-
sity and made a. plea for that econ-
omic principle of “equal pay for
equal work,” which will sooner or
later become operative in the ‘new
economic world which has to deal
with women as an economic factor.

Henrietta. Rau-h presented the
question of right of petition, peti-
tion which would -be considered _ as
a legitimate expression of student
opinion in regard to administrative
inenests affecting them. “ .

The question as to why Pitt did
not have a. chapter of Phi Beta Kap-
pa was asked by Anna Dodds, and
it was answered that standards are
still not sufficiently high to admit
of establishing such an honorary
group.

All the discussion was free and
lopenﬂ and the girls took an interest
in all the questions, which relate to
the improvement of Pitt and the
women students of Pitt.

The results of the election of . of-
ﬂcers for next year was . made as
‘follows: President, Rose Fine; vice
president, Elizabeth Mathaews; secre-

tary, Blanche Parker; treasurer,
Mary Grella.

Rose Fine received the position by
a large majority of the votes cast.
Competition in the other cases was
a little closer, the vice presidency
being decided by a majority of but
three votes. Miss Fine has been
chairman of the committee for
Women’s Selfgovernment.

Miss McCullough or the Depart
ment of Sociology presented to the
women at this time, the responsibil-
ity of their becoming members of
the League.of Women Citizens, the
organization which has superseded
that of Woman's Suffrage. The new
league, is organized with the main
idea of preparing women for the use

ceased to exist. They are beginning
to wear new “lids," loud ties of every

to receive the new class next fall.
Memories of the past year will be re-
hashed and all animosity will cease
at this smoker. Those ‘that don't

all to come.

and the consequent economic break-

A iilat increase of $60 in the till-
tion 'of all students ‘registering at
this University next year is an-
nounced in letters sent out recent-
ly by the registrar to all Pitt stu-
dents. This step _is taken, accord-
ing to the statement in the letter,
to ‘provide for increased operating
expenses ahd salaries. Present
charge-s are declared’ to be entirely
lnadequate to meet the current ex-
penditure of the University. This
action has been taken by the Board
of Trustees, only after it had’vain-
ly attempted to get along with the
l.'ormer- rates of tuition, and is in
line with similar actions taken by
practically all other educational in-
stitutions of he country to meet the
mounting cost of operations.

Under the new plan, all schools
where the present annual (tuition is
$150, will raise the rate to $210,
$110 of which is to be paid the first
semester. In the School of Dentistry
where the tuition - fee has been
raised from $200 to $250, $135 is to
be paid in the first semester. In
the School of Medicine, $160 is to
be paid the first semester, and $150
the second. Another important
change. is that requiring a total
charge from all students in the Un-
(Iergraduate Schools of $840, before
the degree is granted, even-if the
course be completed in less than four
ye§I's. Thus, a student completing
his course in three years, will act-
ually pay $280 a year tuition.

The tuition charge for those tak-
ing Iess than 12 credit hours per
semester_ will be $7.00 per credit
hour. Tlieiother changes of impor-
tance are: 1—That requiring a. fee
of $5.00 for each examination for
-advanced standing without regard -to
the number of credits involved. also

reunion of the “Varsity Letter Club”

Trees gym, this being a part of the
Athletic Day Commencement ‘pro-
gram. All are urged to rush them
back to the secretaryq, “Bob” Grove, at
the alumni office, 503 Commonwealth
building, so those in charge will know
how many to prepare for. Undergrad-
uate letter men have been invited to
attend without charge. The rate for
the alumni is $1. All the varsity
coaches, managers and captains" will
be on hand and it will be regular
hand shaking affair between the old
and new athletic men. “Pop” Warner
has written from Springville, N." Y.,
that he can be counted on to be here.
The program will be a snappy in-
formal one, with no speeches. The
coaches will be introduced to the
crowd and may have a word or._ two to
say regardingiprospects for 1920, but
that is all. There will be two cracker-
jack boxing bouts, one of them likely
between “Dutch” Hendrain and "Biff”
Bremen. Arnold Thornburg and
“Mickey" Gross may get’ together in
the other one. Then there will be
some real big surprise features that
are sure to bring down the house., A
good jazz orchestra will keep things

to see that the affair isn’t,noiseles_s.
A “feed" will be served at the wind-

PITT ALUMNI IN INDIA

Frank H. Ramsey,I’10, of Bayonne.
N. J., writes the alumni ofﬁce regard-
ing U. N. Roy, Mines '11, who is now
superintendent of the Rewah State
colleries, 'Uma.ria, C..I. India. He re-
ports that a second youngster has ar-
rived at-Roy’s home, a daughter, now
about 7 months old. He also states
that a young daughter recently arriv-
ed at the home of A. C. Bose, another

attended Pitt. Bose did -notgraduate
here, completing,hi,s course in chem-
istry at the ~Unive-rsity of‘ Michigan.

' Roy and Bose. correspond from time
to time. Their ﬁrst meeting -took
place on a ship bringing them to this
country for their college work. It’ is
doubtful if two more popular foreign
students -ever attended the University.
Roy is a member of the General A]-
umni Association and, we hope, is
‘getting The Weekly.

NEW JOB FOR EMERSON

A note comes from R. G. (Slicky)
Emerson, ’17, advising that he is now
in-charge of the Publicity Bureau of
the Seattle (Wash.-) Chamber of
Commerce and Commercial club. He
says the work is very interesting, in-
deed. ‘ Regarding The Weekly, he re-
»marks: “The paper puts in- its ap-
pearance regularly now and tickles me
"greatly. Uni is certainly making good

— progress and we are all glad to hear.-

all the good tidings through The
iWeekly... This is certainly a ﬁne
country and if any of the new Pitt
alumni who graduate in June want to
try their luck out here I’ll be glad to
hear from them. Jobsare about the
same as around Pittsburgh.”

THE GRAND

Mark Twain's famous story,
"»H‘ucl<l_-_-berry Finn,” the masterpiece
of all his lovable and human works
of ﬁcpiori, has been put into an all-
star =pecial production by the Para-
mount-Artcraft Company, and will
head the program at .Pittsburgh's
Nev Million Dollar Grand all next’
We: 1:, starting Monday morning, May
31, telling a lot about men and
w«.men, and a lot more thaft one
would love or “cuss" in a boy, it
has been produced just as Twain
-himself would picture it; with the
fhrilling, amusing events, and the

seated ‘as though lifted bodily from
the written pages..-

“Huckleberry Finn” has long been
the world’s greatest romance of
youth. Read‘ with joy by countless
millions, translated into every civil-
ized tongue, breathing lite and fun
and -sorrow and adventure. it has
been transposed to the screen with
an‘ amazing faithfulness to the orig-
inal text. -’ A '

great deal of ' interest, butwhen the

' news is let, out 01; thebag that a’ five .
. reel feature. comedy. sensation, made-
; and producedlby Mack -Sennett, him-

self. with all the leading comedy

appearing,-well, nuf ced.

Critics everywhere . throughout ~ the
country have praised this production,
the latest front the Sennett studios,

all its own, as a production that
reaches the greatest heights that have

1 ever been reached by a producer of

comedy spectacles. Every resource of
the enormous Sennett studios in Cali-
fornia are involved in the results of
this production; every means that was
ever contrived in a. studio to bring
rnerriment to motion picture lovers
has been brought into play and every
incident that is brought about bythe
story which is laid on a real honest-
to-goodness farm in the inimitable
manner in which none other but a
Sennett could do, brings forth results
that are thrilling, comic, _ hilarious,
farcical and furiously funny.

“Down oil the Farm" is an ‘excep-
tional feature and has been a ‘sense.-
tion in every community in which it
has appeared. 2 ,3

In addition to this great comedy fea-
ture, the Olympic Theater is also pre-
senting another feature picture in ad-
dition to the ever popular and enter-
taining Pathe News, while the ...or-
chestra will render appropriate music
toaccompany the pictures. ' «

EAST. LIBERTY CAMERAPHONE

The Cameraphone, East Liberty,
presents to its patrons this week,
one of the biggest and most. dra-
matic pictures screened this year,
“The ‘Virgin of .Stam-boul.” It is a
picture that has laid‘ hold of ‘the
public imagination by reason of the
hugeness of its canvas. Great des-
erts across which slow moving cara-
vans wend their way——-where the Black
Horse Troop scoops down to lety
tribute-——where the Virgin, raging at
their head,’ storms the gates of
Bunkra to save her \,American lover
from the doom of Achmet Hamid.
Dramatic in its lighter moments
with delicious comedy as only Pris-
civlla Dean can register it. The love
story of a beautiful beggar girl and
a dashing American soldier of for-
tune. To add to the interest of this
great feature the Cameraphone will
present an allegorical prelude at all
evening performanz.-es,_ __introducing
Mle. Sari, the famous Oriental dan-
cer in a specialty, bringing memo-
ries of the dreamy days and hectic
nights of the Orient- ' '

‘ That Pitt students fully appreciate
the beneﬁts of a university education,
is shown by the fact that nearly a
fourth of the present enrollment at
Pitt consists of men returned from
service for their country in the Great
War. Figures recently compiled by
the registrar indicate that fully 915
men of the university who joined the
_ have
come back to Pitt to‘ complete their
studies. The School of Dentistry
leads in this respect, no less than 162
students of that school being in this
list. _One hilndred and eighty-ﬁve
School of Economics men, including
42-in the evening school of Economics,
were in the military and naval forces
of the United States. The College and
College Pre-Medical School,‘ with 135
ex-service men, and the School of En-
gineerlng with 121, stand next. A com-
parison of the record established in
this regard by Pitt with other univer-
sities, shows that this school ranks
among the 'very highest, both as to
the number of men furnished to the
country for war service, and as to
the number and percentage of men
returned to school after their task
had been accomplished. The record
of each school follows: '

Trotsky, with their alluring ‘promises
of equal division of th.é‘1and among
the ‘peasantry, found fertile soil in
which to sow the seeds of ~Bolshevis_m.
Thus it was, in the belief. that their
hunger tor land would be I satisﬁed.
that the agricultural population at
iirst gave its support to that move-
ment. . . . .

A third source 10.1?‘ Bolshevism, ac-
cording to Baron Korfr was the dis-
integration ‘of the Russian armies.
With no less than 18 million men
under arms, poorly fed, poorly clothed
and provisioned, it is little’ wonder
that their morale cracked under the
continueddefeats, and‘ the Bela-l_ was
made ripe for the S/wiet .3-gitators,

A The loss by -the soldiery of thephabits
. 30f thrift, the severance of family and

religious bonds, and the shattering of
military discipline were recounted as

I other reasons for the spread of discon-
V tent and the triumph oi,‘ Bolshevism.

‘.‘Despite these favorable opportuni-

'ties for its success, the Bolshevik ex-

periment has been a thorough failure,"
was the emphatic opinion of Baron
Korff.‘ It does not Work,‘ because no
one works under it,” was the pithy
comment or the speaker, who then
went 'c'n- to review the history and
operation of the govlet regime. He
told of four classes eiisting in Russia
at the, time .of the Bolshevist coup:

namely, the aristocracy, the bourge-
oisie or middle class, "the factory
laborer or proletariat, and the peasan-
try. The ﬂrst of these, he added, has

practically disappeared.‘ The middle
class, however, has been‘ subjected to

constant oppression, and to a syste-
matic policy of extermination. Na.-
uénalization of all the industries was

(the first big step undertaken by ‘the

Soviet government. For a brief pe-
riod it was successful. Then grave
diﬂiculties arose. Capit_al has prac-
tically vanished, the banks had been
closed down, and the engineers and
experts driven "out.
country was faced with an industrial
paralysis. Reluctantly, the Bolshevik

back the former employers and ex-
perts.‘ and offer them special induce-
ments even to the extent (if abolish-

repairing the shattered economic
fabric. Former commanders and mili-
tary leaders likewise were recalled.
and the anomalous condition where
the officers of aregirnent had to con-
sult the‘ soldier's soviet before attack-

ing or retreating, was done away with.

“Thus we see,” the speaker afﬂrmed,
“that wherever the Bolshevik govern-
ment attempted to translate its theo-

Boséieinto the. was-on ’1391.§,§9Yi.9ni- 1”

Big Intercollegate Meet At-
tracts Attention; V But‘ One
Dual Meet Remains on

' Track Schedule

_ Penn State was forced to cancel
their dual meet with Pitt, which was
to have been held last Saturday on
Schenley Oval, in connection with the
(Interscholastic meet. The death of
Dr. Pond-,. for ov 30 years professor
of science and a’. man who has taken
‘an active interest in athletics at State,
resulted in thecallging off of all classes
and athlet'ic'*games at that institution
in his memory. ' '

The cancellation came as a -bitter
disappointment to the Pitt team. The
rivalry between the two schools is al-
ways’ keen and i the Panthers, ,eager
to avenge the aczeat,on the gﬂdilron

. last fall, were on edge fer this nest.)
* Although

the advance song “had

Center Countians and" the  -itittany

track schedule, that being with West

How many inen will be sent to rep-

are certain--Wiegle and Shea. There
are severlil other “ifs.”. If Harry
Martin comes  exceptionally well
in the 220-yard low hurdles; if Bill
Capers jumps 22 feet; if Peters
shows enough stuﬁ in «the sprints; if
Tom Thornton puts the shot 41 feet;
if ‘Chapel jumps six feet, or if Jim
