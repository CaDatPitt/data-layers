four students and wounded nine others.
The events which followed that tragedy left

The wounds inﬂicted on the students were

suffered have spanned a period of four

"small core of passionate people who insist

they want not revenge, but justice.

The struggle these people waged against
the Department of Justice and ofﬁcials in

«:the.‘state of Ohio reveals much about

American government and its susceptibility

‘ to manipulation in the hands of unscrupu-
b lous and self-serving men.

A summary ‘of the FBI investigation into

A. the events at Kent‘ State was released in
‘ July 1970 by the Department ofJustice. The

report states the shooting was unnecessary,
that reports of a sniper were unfounded. and
that the guardsmen were not surrounded by

students as alleged by officials in the

National Guard. The report maintained that
at the time of the shooting, no student posed

. a threat to the lives of the guardsmen.

In October a more detailed summary of
the FBI report appeared in the New York
Times; that report leveled more serious
charges against the guardsmen. The

' Justice Department had reason to believe,

according to the report, that subsequent to
the shooting guardsmen had conspired to

. -fabricate their story of self-defense.

William Scranton. former governor of
Pennsylvania, was appointed by President
Nixon in May 1970 to chair the President's
Commission on Campus Unrest.

In October 1970, the Scranton Commis-

I sion reported to the President that the

shooting was _“unnecessary, unwarranted

and inexcusable.“ ‘ '
The commission's report condemned the

guardsmen‘s use of live ammunition. Even

‘ "if the guardsmen faced danger, it was not .
—__‘a- danger that called for lethal force."

The commission did not attempt to
explain the killings and did not evaluate the
possible criminal liability of the guardsmen.
It has been written in numerous articles
dealing with Kent State the commission
issue of criminality in
expectation that the Justice Department
would convene a federal grand jury to
investigate that issue. »

In his book, The Truth About Kent State:
A Challenge’ to the American Conscience,
Peter Davies presents a compelling case for
discrediting the special grand jury convened

 

by Governor James Rhodes of Ohio to
investigate the killings.

Davies presents evidence which suggests
collusion on the part of Gov. Rhodes. Judge
Edwin W. Jones who presided over the case
and the prosecutors involved. Davies also
explains that the -jury was selected from
among “people who resided so close to
campus (they) naturally injected local
emotionalism into their deliberations."

The jury in their ﬁndings described the
noon rally as having “degenerated into a
riotous mob." Both the FBI and Scranton
reports had termed it a peaceful assembly.
The jury continued, “Those who acted as
participants and agitators are guilty of
deliberate, criminal conduct." _

And in regard to the guardsmen, the
grand jury found they fired “in the honest
and sincere belief and under circumstances
which would have logically caused them to
believe that they would suffer serious bodily
injury had they not done so.”

Every conclusion the grand jury reached
about the Guard was contrary to the ﬁndings
of the Justice Department and the FBI
investigation.

Davies’ indictment of the Ohio special
grand jury is supported by the two civil suits
which challenged" the report and the
indictments. The Federal District Court in
Cleveland found the report unconstitutional
and ordered it expunged from the records
and physically destroyed.

With the release of the grand jury report
those who were waiting for justice, for the
death of the four students to be uncovered,
turned their eyes to Washington and the
Department ofJustice--then under the reign
of Attorney General John Mitchell.

After the FBI report was published
Mitchell conceded that there appeared to
have been violations of federal law by both
students and guardsmen at Kent State.
After the release of the Ohio grand jury
report which flew in the face of the FBI
investigation, it seemed as though Mitchell,
the representative of the American judicial
system, would be compelled to convene ‘a
grand jury to dig out the truth about the
killings.

The Krauses:  

By SCOTT MACLEOD
and SHARON SEXTON

With ever increasing sarcasm and
cynicism,'Arthur Krause, whose daughter,
Allison, was killed by National Guards-
men at Kent State University May 4, 1970,
continues his pursuit for justice. As a
cynic, he is self-proclaimed. but the sar-
casm comes out in conversation.

His pursuit, which has lasted four years.
is largely to force the American people to
understand the important distinction bet-
tween public officials and the offices they
might hold—a distinction now made more
popular in post-Watergate America.

“You can’t fight City Hall.” Krause
says nodding sarcastically. Or. “The king
can do no wrong.” '

Since his daughter and three others were

killed in Ohio, Krause has been a leading .

force in the eventual convening of the fed-
eral grand jury in Cleveland and also in the
recent Supreme Court ruling which allows
the parents of the Kent State victims to
sue the public officials believed respon-
sible in the shootings. Krause wants the
truth out about Kent State.

The public officials, including then
Ohio governor James Rhodes. have never
been cross examined in the incident.
Krause maintains they are hiding behind
the law. but insists they are not above the
law.

in a broadcast on the day before the
shootings. Krause quoted. reading from a
periodical in his collection, “Rhodes char-
acterized violent dissidence at Kent as

official in The Board of Church and Society
of the United Methodist Church and another
advocate of the federal grand jury were met
with assurance that the Justice Department
had the Kent State killings under intensive
review.

Continued effort on their part and by
others, including five U.S. senators--
McGovern, Hughes, Tunney, Stevenson,
and Bayh to press for a federal grand jury
were fruitless. Unofﬁcial reports began to
leak from the Justice Department to the
effect that the department had decided
against convening a grand jury.

In August 1971 Mitchell announced his
decision to close the Kent State file. He
conceded the shooting was “unnecessary,
unwarranted and inexcusable.” The
Attorney General explained, however, the
convening of a grand jury to probe further
was out of the question because there was
“no credible evidence of a conspiracy
between National Guardsmen to shoot
students on the campus...and no likelihood
of successful prosecution of individual
guardsmen.”

Mitchell went on to‘ say “the department
has taken every possible action to serve
justice."

Arthur Krause reacted appropriately in

the Christian Science Monitor, “Not to .

convene a federal grand jury when there is
any possibility of indictment means that the
Justice Department is acting as judge and
jury-”

Those who were dedicated to the struggle
to uncover the truth attempted over the next

-two years to persuade Mitchell to re-open

the case. Their efforts met with no success
until the Justice Department changed
hands. The new Attorney General, Elliot
Richardson reopened the ﬁle and, as a
result. a federal grand jury was convened in
December 1973 in Cleveland.

On March 29. three months after the jury
convened. one present and seven former
National Guardsmen were indicted.

While the battle for the grand jury» went
on in Washington, the parents of the slain
students waged a long hard ﬁght which
began in the Ohio courts and ended in the
Supreme Court granting them the right to
sue former Ohio Governor Rhodes and

worse than the brown shirts and commun-
ist element and also the night riders and
vigilantes. They’re the worst group of peo-
ple we harbor in America.” Rhodes’ broad-
cast was beamed into the National Guard
bivouc area on campus where some tem-
pers were very high.

“I want him to explain about the brown
shirts and the worst element and so forth.

I want him to explain.“ Krause continued

insistently.

During an interview in the Krause‘s
Churchill home. Allison’s mother. Doris

Krause. grew more emotional than her‘

husband. “We just want the court to say
what the guardsmen did was wrong.” she
said. “We’ve heard throughout the years
that after this thing Del Corso and Canter-
bury went the Chamber of Commerce cir-

cuit. They went from one banquet to an--

other. They were guest speakers. They
were heroes. That’s pretty hard to live
with. We want‘ somebody to tell them that
what they did was wrong.”

The Krause’s insist that in their pur-

suit, there is no‘ feeling of vendetta. “If
you were killed, God forbid’._’ Mrs. Krause

_ theorized, “Would your father not want

to know why? And why the men did it?
Would he not want something done about
it? It’s just as simple and as -basic as
that.”

Arthur Krause’s persistence and ded-
ication to the cause of justice is evident in
his forceful self-assuring manner. At an
airport in November. 1972, while on a

reversed lower court rulings that held state
ofﬁcials immune from such lawsuits.

The Court ruled that the estates of Allison
Krause, Jeffrey Miller, and "Sandy Scheuer
have ‘a trial on merits of charges that their
civil rights had been violated during the

-campus demonstrations. Parents ‘of the
fourth victim, William Schroeder, have not
ﬁled suit. -

Chief Justice Warren Burger, writing for
the Court, stressed the ruling does not
determine whether any of the defendants
are liable, but merely provides the parents
an opportunity to prove their case in court.

Who ﬁred the shots that killed four
students and wounded nine others? Why

-did they ﬁre? Did the guards make plans to

ﬁre as they huddled in the football ﬁeld
minutes before the shootings? Had the
troop really run out-of tear gas when they
resorted to live ammunition?

The questions are endless. They have
gone unanswered for four years. Only after
four years of bitter struggle with the
institution delegated with the responsibility
of administering justice, is justice ﬁnally
being exercised.

The paradox is obvious. The motivation
less so. The speed with which Richardson
jury after being
appointed attorney general and the relative
speed with which the indictments were
served, when compared to the four years of
waiting, indicates that it was not the system
but the leadership which was deficient.

The desire not to serve justice on the part
of Mitchell, the President and their aides
was due in large part to the view within the
administration that students were “bums,”
and dissenters brown shirts.

Nixon and Mitchell might have been
vulnerable to one type of persuasion -- the
petitioning of a majority or even a large part
of the electorate. But, unfortunately, the
electorate was silent. The American people
were largely unmoved by the Administra-
tion's disregard for the four lives lost at

The American people failed to respond to a
blatant disregard for the administration of
justice. This disinterest is more puzzling

business trip in North Carolina, he bump-
ed into the Senate Watergate Committee’s
chairman, Sam Ervin. Ervin is also_chair-
man of the Senate’s subcommittee on Con-
stitutional Rights.

“I had written him some long letters.”
Krause remembers, “and he had never an-
swered one. So I gave him a little lecture
right there about how he was one of the
last hopes, being chairman of the Constitu-
tional Rights subcommittee. And I told him
he wasn’tdoing his job.”

Sometime later Krauseireceived a let-
ter from Ervin telling Krause that perhaps

.he had been correct.

Another public official, President Nixon,
did not greet Arthur Krause with such can-
dor and humility. According to Mrs.
Krause, the letter they received from the
President after the shootings was “only
a duty letter.”

Indeed. both Krause’s believe that
President Nixon played a large part in the
cover-up of the Kent State tragedy. Mr.
Krause called the Kent State coverup.
“basic training for Watergate.”

“You know, there was an election com-

-. ing up in 1972 and the President had been

running for reelection from the night he
was elected in 1968,” Mr. Krause explains.

“If they had convened a federal grand
jury and there had been indictments, there
would have been a trial» probably in 1972.
There was an election that year and Ohio
is a very important pivotal state. They
didn’t want to do anything that would cause
them to lose the vote in Ohio and perhaps
the election.

An engineer by profession, Krause. as
the books on his bookshelves attest. is a
devout student of politics.

“And I’ve been a student of Nixon since
1952, Krause maintains. “I practically
predicted what was going-to happen. If
you study someone for a long time and you
know their track record, they don’t often
change. Anything that is rotten he. will do——-
it’s politics.

“The American people want to believe
in the man,” Krause continues. “It’s very
hard for the American people to under-
stand that the man doesn’t measure up.”

“They believe in the office.” Mrs.
Krause broke in, “and they think the man
and the office are the same thing.”

The Krause’s feel that Watergate had
something to do with convening of the Kent
State federal grand jury last December.

“Nixon made the horrible mistake of
picking the proper man to be Attorney Gen-
eral of the United States,” Arthur Krause
said sarcastically. “He picked/Elliot Rich-
ardson and Elliot Richardson is a good
man. In the short time Elliot Richardson
was in there the people in the Justice De-
partment knew that a coverup had been
done and were able to fend the facts out.”

Asked about John Mitchell, the Attor-
ney General who served at the time of the
Kent State shootings. Krause noted that
Mitchell’s opinion of justice differed great-
ly from his own. ‘

“His opinion of justice is for friends
and Republicans. His opinion of justice
is that it should be kept quiet. My opinion
‘of justice is that it should be brought out
into the open.”

American’s perceptions of legitimate
authority as shown in their trust in the in-
stitution of the presidency was a factor
which shaped popular opinion in the disfav-
or of the slain students after the shootings.
according to the Krause’s. ’

“I think there was a lot of guilt in Ameri-
ca,” Mr. Krause remembers. “And some"-
times we get angriest when we realize
we’re wrong. Don’t you get angry when
you’ve been caught doing something
wrong? This was a governmental act and
the peoplereacted by asking, ‘How can the
government be wrong?’’’ .

 

 

“Without knowing the truth of anything.
they formed their opinions.” Mrs. Krause
added.

_In their quest for justice. the Krause’s
have met and become friends with many
well known personalities.

In their quest for justice. the Krause’s
have met and become friends with many
well known personalities.

Perhaps the most faithful friend of all is
Peter Davies, author of The Truth About
Kent State, a book widely assailed as the
only truth about Kent State ever published.

Davies explains the beginning of his re-
lationship with Krause in his book: 1

“On Wednesday, May 13. 1970. Arthur
Krause called me from Pittsburgh to ex-'
press his appreciation for my letter to the
President. This gesture on his part sealed
my commitment to ensure that justice was
done in this cruel and senseless act.”

A British-born naturalized American who ‘

is an insurance salesman, Davis has sin-
cerely dedicated the last four years of his
life to the justice effort. The royalties of
his Kent State account, it reads on the jack-
et of his book, will be devoted to the con-
tinuing quest for justice at Kent State.

The Krause’s claim that Davies’ book has
had a great effect upon those who have
read it. “Sunday night somebody called out
of the clear blue sky and asked what they.
could do. .

“What’s so good about the book is that
it’s in pictures. You don’t have to take any-
body’s word. It isn’t opinion—it’s fact,”

I Mr.S.Krause explained. '

_ Arthur Krause won a huge victory in
his fight for justice at Kent State a few
weeks ago with the Supreme Court ruling.
And no doubt he’1l keep battling until jus-
'_ti(ce is served to his satisfaction.

“We’ve proven that there should have
been a federal grand jury,” Krause says.

stopped there from being a federal grand

“I want this out front,” Krause said of

to be open, candid with people. Govern-
ment is supposed to put the facts out.

That’s what it’s all about in our country.

BY RITA VITOLO

On a quiet campus in Pittsburgh in the
beginning of springtime, the events of May
4, 1970 at Ohio's Kent State University
seem distant and unreal. That is the guile of
memory.

One year after the Indochina War
officially ended and after the first group of
POW’s camehome, the anti-war passion
that brought Kent State students together to

protest the Nixon Administration’s con-_

tinued bombing of Cambodia has dissi-
pated. Pitt is not the only quiet campus this
spring.

Yet the“ events at Kent State haunt the
imagination and each individual is left to
exorcise private devils.~ ,,

Greg Williams, a soft-spoken black man
now a communications graduate student
here, was in an undergrad dorm at Ohio's

Dayton when he heard news of the shooting.
He reminisces in a gentle voice that belies
his words:l “I remember thinking the
capitalists that run this country were ﬁnally
showing their true colors.

“Kent State proved to the world what a
lot of black people had known for a long
time--that capitalism was deeper than just
race. That they wouldn’t stop at killing
black boys, but they would kill white
children too.

“Kent State was a climax to a whole
decade’s way of thinking, it was a climax to
students being upset with the system and
protesting it. And the system retaliated by
showing how it deals with dissidents.

“You can’t pay for four lives."

Bitterness is evident when talking to
students about Kent State four years after

Thursday, May 2, 1974—THE PITT NEWS—Page 5

Pitt Students Remember Kent State Shootings  

the deaths, and traces of frustration with the
entity undefined as “the system” remain,
but above all there is a willingness to forget.
With perspectives tempered by hindsight,
sadness is the dominant emotion in 1974.
Justice is not being sought by students.
On April 4, one present and seven former
members of the Ohio National Guard
indicted in the Kent State shootings pleaded
not guilty to charges of violating the victims‘
civil rights.
A New York Times editorial March 30 hailed
the grand iury indictments as a step toward
expunging a “dismal chapter in the annals
of the US system of justice," claiming
iustice for the memory of the dead and
wounded students and their families is at
stake in Ohio now.
“What _iustice is that? asked Pitt senior

Joe Venza. “The best justice the system

can provide and that’s all the parents‘ "

get--de facto_iustice. The whole system was
wrong, the war and protesting, and four
people dead and four years later doesn’t
make them any less dead does it, or the
system any_more right.”

The events at Kent State on May 4, 1970
are assured a place in history, but just what
that place will be is a matter for speculation,
an enigma.

“Kent State was the beginning of the
end," said another, himself an enigma
admitting only to the name Reuben. “It was
the end of mass demonstrations and the end
of student protests.

“It was good for the government. Maybe
bad for you.”

Jackson State, declined to ask a
Federal grand iury for indictments.

The whitewash of these killings

A forced the families of the victims to

seek the truth in civil courts.

For nearly four years the parents
have borne the burden of what the
government refused to do. When
Elliot Richardson became Attorney

«General, the Kent State case was

finally reopened_and a Federal
grand jury convened. On March
29th this year, the iury indicted
eight Ohio National Guardsmen.
For the families, however, civil
litigations against Ohio ofﬁcials
continue to accumulate enormous
legal costs not affected by the

   

indictments. If a just resolution is
achieved,tthere is reason to hope
that the Justice Department will
reexamine the Jackson State
Killings. Perhaps reason to hope
this will never happen to anyone's
children again.

“Artists for Justice" can help
the parents meet their ﬁnancial
obligations. On May 19 at Town
Hall. in Manhattan, we will present
a special beneﬁt performance that
will include appearances by cele-
brities and artists from the Concert
Stage and the Broadway Stage, as
well as as excerpts from two highly
acclaimed ﬁlms: Paul Ronder’s
PBS-TV documentary, “A Part of
