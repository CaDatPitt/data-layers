Worker: 50 to 100 in Oakland couIdn’t vote

Almost 100 Oakland residents
were turned away from at least
one polling location during yes-
terday’s midterm elections.
Blithe Runsdorf, a judge of

elections, said 50 to 100 people
who said they ﬁlled out change-

Election Day went largely as many
political insiders and observers
predicted, with the GOP taking
back control" of the House but fail-
ing to secure the Senate.
Although Republican candi—
dates took back a majority in Con-
gress and a couple of Tea Party
candidates took Senate seats,
yesterday’s midterm elections
were not a total loss for Demo-
crats — though they did lose the
Pennsylvania governorship and
one of the state’s Senate seats. -
Reporters and columnists
pointed to burgeoning discontent
with government spending and
ongoing economic troubles as the
main force behind many Republi-
can victories, setting the stage for
two years worth of confrontation
between President Obama and a

Republican-controlled House of
Representatives .

Despite falling far behind in
the preliminary reports, Repub-
lican Tom Corbett beat Democrat
Dan Onorato in the governor’s

‘ race, securing 54 percent of the

vote. Onorato secured 46 percent,
only winning in Philadelphia and
Lackawanna counties.‘

By 10 p.m., a numberof na—
tional and local news sources
started calling the race in Cor-
bett’s favor.

Onorato concededshortly be-
fore 11 p.m., putting an end to a
tight race and extending the six-
decade streak of party ﬂip—ﬂop-
ping in the Governor’s Mansion:
Since the 1950s, neither party has
held the governor’s seat for more
than eight consecutive years.

During his concession speech

Hetal Patel, a Pitt freshman,
waited as Runsdorf made a phone
call to verify her information.

Patel told elections workers
that she received a knock on her
door in her campus dormitory
sometime between the last week
of September and the first week
of October. Two people asked her
if she was registered to vote. Pa-
tel said she told them she was not

card and gave it back to them.

“I was really excited to vote,”
Patel said, “I just turned 18.” .

Patel said she never received .

Opinions I

Obama, equalize A
the ranks already

ou might once have thought

I!‘ a Democratic commander-

in-chief would make equal-

izing the military a top priority. But

considering Monday’s news, Presi-

dent Barack Obama has deﬁed our
expectations.

Two days ago, a San Francisco
federal appeals court indeﬁnitely
extended a freeze on a judge’s or-
der to halt enforcing the Don’t Ask
Don’t Tell policy inthe armed forces,
according to the Associated Press;
Essentially, pushed by a stay request
from President Obama’s]ustice De-
partment, a three—judge panel from
the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Ap-
peals decided — until further notice
— to keep the policy in place.

So until one day in the uncertain
future, -gay Americans will continue
to be barred from enlisting or serv-
ing in the military if they disclose
their sexual orientation.

And the stay request is not only
intended to give the judicial process
a chance to take a breather. In fact,
the Obama administration is ﬁling
motions to challenge the court’s
former ruling that banning‘ openly
homosexual military personnel is
unconstitutional, arguing that the
policy would be more appropriately
decided in the legislature.

While in general we applaud the
decisive exercise of caution that
typiﬁes Obama’s leadership style, in‘

this case, dilly—dallying is unwise. Of

course, following up a judicial over-
turn of DADT with solid legislative
support is ideal, but waiting for the
bills to pass before taking such a mo-
mentous opportunity to equalize the
ranks is simply cruel —— cruel to the
service members, to their families
and to the country.

To begin, indeﬁnitely continuing
the ban is costing the Department
of Defense millions. According to a
2005 reportby the U.S. Government
Accountability Ofﬁce, rippingranks

from service members based on
their expressed sexual orientation
and then recruiting replacements
has cost the United States more than
$95 million from the policy’s incep-
tion in 1993 through 2004.
Second, a number of studies have
debunked the idea that gay soldiers
undermine “unit cohesion,” or the
ability of a group of soldiers to
work together to accomplish com-
mon tasks. According to one study

‘from the University of Califomia—

afﬁliated research institute the Palm
Center, “The data indicated no asso-
ciations between knowingalesbian
or gay unit member and ratings of
perceived unit cohesion or readi-
ness. Instead, ﬁndings pointed to
the importance of leadershipand
instrumental quality in" shaping
perceptions of unit cohesion and
readiness.”

Let’s also not forget the grow-
ing unpopularity of Don’t Ask
Don’t Tell. For more than two years
of nationwide polling, more than
three-fourths of Americans have
consistently expressed their interest

V in repealing the Department of De-

fense’s policy. Even current military
service members themselves over-
whelmingly said they’d reenlist if the
policy were overturned, according to
a 2006 poll from market research
ﬁrm Zogby International.

There’s no doubt that with the
communicative explosion character-
izing the last decade, this country
has made tremendous strides since
1993 in terms of social acceptance.

Serving among our most pre-
eminent of representatives, the U.S.
Military should reﬂect our social
progress, not project a misleading
message of homophobic confusion.
After all, how can we slap the label of
“nation’s ﬁnest” on a ﬁindamentally
segregated system? Obama should

‘ answer this questionbefore continu-

ing to enforce DADT. I

Columnist

Are you indie‘? _
Back during dinosaur times,
when somebody said that he was
indie, we just assumed he meant
he had been named after Indiana
Jones. Given Dr._]ones’ preeminent
status among the great adventur-
ers of the day, this seemed like a
safe bet. But, times havechanged,
and indie is now as complicated
a word as organic (which used to
mean made from organisms but
now means, among other things,
that it’s Darfur—safe and thus okay
for hipsters to buy)..What with

the new knowledge economy, we‘

now believe that no one should
leave college without a thorough
understanding of what’s out and
what’s indie. Luckily, we’ve spent
the equivalent of two medieval
peasants’ lifetimes keeping up
with the Indie-anajoneses.

The ﬁrst thing you need to

know about something that’s in-
die is that it isn’t mainstream. Big
Macs, blockbuster movies where
robots ﬁght other robots, Ameri-
can Eagle cargo shorts and Dane
Cook are all examples-of what’s
mainstream. If you’re looking to
go indie, you need to avoid all of
that stuff, starting with the cargo
shorts. The mainstream might be a
great place to ﬁnd 2-for-1 deals as
well as “Two and a Half Men,” but
neither is the least bit indie.

Lots of different forms of me-
dia, clothing and people may qual-
ify as indie, and the designation
is often dependent upon context.
An “alpha male” beard on Al Gore
was weird but still mainstream,
whereas ‘woolly whiskers on a
20-year-old singer-songwriter
named after a carbonated bever-
age from the Great Depression are
most assuredly indie. Betty White

_in the ’80s was mainstream, but

Betty White in her 80s is argu-
ably indie, at least when she was
limited to one Super Bowl adver-
tisement and a popular Facebook

group. A T-shirt made in Darfur
and sold at Walmart isn’t the least
bit indie, but a “Save Darfur” T-
shirt made in Los Angeles and sold

at American Apparel is as indie as _

you can get. _

' An indie ﬁlmneeds to move as
slow as molasses with pale, reedy
actors delivering ironic dialogue
in their most nonchalant mono-
tones. The whole shebang should
be set to the soothing sounds of
that aforementioned woolly—whis-
kered singer-songwriter twanging
away on an acoustic guitar he dis-
covered at a dying, impoverished

V bluesman’s garage sale. Even if it’s

borderline unwatchablei — and
trust us,_most of these gloriﬁed
YouTube videos are — people out-
side the mainstream will waste no
time acquiringits deﬁnitive Crite-
rion Collection edition (now with
a director’s commentary of the
director’s commentary) on DVD.
Indie webzines are great places
to keep up with what’s going on in
the indie world. The Onion’s A.V.
Club is a borderline-mainstream

Stewart nota journalist, but skilled satirist

Brendan Sullivan
For The Pitt News

What have we come to when we must
call on Jon Stewart to smack some
sense into the American electorate?

I must admit, despite my almost
fanboy—level affection for Stewart,
host of “The Daily Show,” I was less
than pleasedwhenlﬁrst heard about
the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or
Fear held last Saturday. It seemed to
me that he was stepping out of his
protective sack of satire, that Stewart
was abandoning his precious out-
sider status for a political scene that
would almost surely reject him out
of hand. ’

What’s more, I considered it a
denial of principles the ﬁmnyman
himselfhas put forth. . v 0

When Stewart appeared on
“Crossﬁre” in 2004, host Tucker
Carlson attacked him for lobbing
“softball” questions at then—presi—
dential candidatejohn Kerry, saying
that he wasn’t employing journalis-
tic integrity. Stewart couldn’t have
agreed more, throwing up his hands

and saying, “The show that leads in I

to me is puppets making crank phone
calls.” He insisted then that he’s not
a journalist but a satirist. It can be
hard to remember this — Stewart
does have a knack for getting visit-
ingpoliticians oﬁ'theirtall<ingpoints
and onto actual, fact-based policy
discussions — but it’s an important
distinction.

Havingwimessed his denial ofhis

V placeinnationalpoliticaljournalism,

Iwas shocked at the announcement

I ofhis rally. Why would he backtrack

to such a degree? But what I had for-

gotten, and what other commen—

tators seem to have forgotten also

as they’ve condemned the rally as

ridiculous, unhelpful and apolitical,

is that the satirists of history have
long been the only ones allowed to

speak truth to power. The jesters of
Shakespeare’s courts, the “holy fools”
of Imperial Russia: All these satirists
were allowed to speak to their rulers

with a candor he would have accepted
from no one else.

The press, now, is fully folded into
thepolitical structure. Its nickname,
tl1e “Fourth Estate,” is awell-deserved

one. And with reporters so ensconced .

in political life, it’s sometimes incred-
ible that we’re so shocked when we
ﬁnd partisan taint in the media.

But remember, Stewart is not a
journalist. He’s a satirist. And in this
special category, he answers to no
politician, no special interest group,
no political party. All he has to do to
be successﬁil is’ make people laugh.

V But what brings Stewartbeyond this

is his desire to see a better America
brought out, and his incredible faith
that such an America is possible.

So I decided to hitch a ride to
Washington with neighbors on Sat-
urday and give the man a chance to

- try and talk some sense.

I spent most of the rally halfway
between a TV news van and a ﬁrst-
aid tent, far away from the stage. I
could see a screen off in the distance,
but it was far enough of that Stew-
art and Stephen Colbert would have
looked interchangeable if it weren’t
for Stewart’s average height. At one

' point, someone 20 feetinfront of my
section held up an enormous yellow '

sign that read “Moderates For Bet-
ter iPhone Reception,” completely
blocking what meager view we had.

Then, from behind me, achant start-
ed: “Put! Down! The Sign! Please!”
Aiter45 seconds, the yellow signwas
politely lowered. P

Even with my View restored,
watching the rally wasn’t much easier.
Organizers clearly underestimated
attendance —— using aerial photo-
graphs, CBS News approximated that
215,000 people attended. Hence, the
screens were too few and the speak-
ers were ill—equipped to combat the
ambient noise created by a couple
hundred thousand people stand-
ing around. But the audience was
extraordinary — at least in terms
of civility. Except for a rare few, the
attendees all quickly quieted them-
selves whenever someone rose to
speak, and I even witnessed a few
group shushings.

After one too many beautiﬁil
harmonies between]eff'I‘weedy and
Mavis Staples and after a debate with
a giant puppet under the control of
Colbert, Stewart came up to speak.
He warned listeners, right up front,
that he was going to “try for some
sincerity.” And sincerity he achieved,
right up to the line of sentimentality,

which he expertly towed. Americans,
he said, are by and large a reason-
able people, willingto make sacriﬁces
and compromises for the good of the
body politic. To illustrate his point he
showed avideo of cars merging from
four lanes down to one, a demonstra-
tion of a long series of compromises
— although this took on anvironic
pallor when I saw the redirected traf-
ﬁc of Washington later that night.

Stewart was at his best when
launching the short, punchy verbiage
that characterizes his show. My favor-
ite platitudes of the afternoon were
the comedian’s reminder that “these
are hard times, not End Times,” and
the Zen-like quip, “If we amplify ev-
erything, we hear nothing.”

So in the end, the funnyman
wasn’t that funny, just reasonable.
He took up the mantle so frequently
shoved onto jesters throughout his-
tory and made adecisive plea for san-
ity. And he did it all while resisting

80 —year_— old Betty White is indie,

Bateman 1 6p

zine that occasionally keys the
wider world into something that

: was.hot ﬁve months ago, and sites

like McSweeney’s and Stuff White
People Like poke knowing ﬁin at
their core readership. What indie

, reader hasn’t stumbled upon one

of McSweeney’s laugh-and-a-half
lists and failed to wet his skinny
jeans with delight? When has one
of Stuff White People Like’s clever
deconstructions of something in-
die done anything but made the

indie faithful laugh at their silly,

self-awareindie-ness? .

Indie is as much a lifestyle as it
is a concept, thoughtway or adjec-
tive, and slight deviations can cost
you dearly. Someone purchasing
a jicama at the farmer’s market
might not think he’s dealing a
ferocious blow to the hegemonic
and thoroughly mainstream agri-
business conglomerate known as

Food, Inc. But that same someone ‘

might have failed to read about the
healing powers of locally grown
jicamas that will surely send de-

cidedly non-indie housewives
speed-walking to do likewise.

In other words, if you want to
stay indie, you must avoid sell-
ing out. College will present you
with many opportunities to sell
out —— opportunities ranging
from unscrupulous corporate re-
cruiters dangling entry-level job
offers at call centers to graduate
and professional schools seeking
to turn you into another one of
“the Man’s” many over-educated
truth-sayers. Unlike your peers —

but very much in the spirit of the
young Indianajones — you need
to resist those temptations and
stay the indie, course. Keep visit-
ing those hostels, ﬁxing the gears
on your bicycle, French pressing
your conﬂict-averse coffee beans
and cutting the oh-so-restricting
legs off your girl jeans, and only
then can you rest assured that
one day someone will appreciate
your unique mix of lute-playing
and spoken word enough to give
you the chance to sell out. At which

Al Gore’s beard is not

point we’re certain you will, be-
cause, hey, you might be indie, but
at least you’re not crazy.

Before last year’s Campus
Superstar competition, Rachel

with singing on campus, but she
decided to take a chance.

“I heard about the competi-
tion through friends, and they
suggested I try it out,” Labosky
said. “I wasn’t sure how far I’d
make it, but I ﬁgured it’d be worth
a shot.”

The Pitt sophomore and dou- .

ble major in communication and
English writing had an optimistic
attitude and a stellar voice that
took her to second place out of
156 contestants.

“The competition helped me
to believe in myself,” Labosky
said. “Before the competition,
I’d been turned down by a few
singing groups here at Pitt, but
after Campus Superstar I decided

not to give up. And because of
that, I am now a member of the

‘Heinz Chapel Choir.”

Film shows children counting tragedy in paperclips

Graduate School of Public Health
Auditorium

Today at 8:30 p.m.

w Free and open to the public

When a group of'I‘ennessee students
set out to learn about a tragedy 12
years ago, they managed to create a
globally recognized movement.
The documentary “Paper Clips”
examines a project that middle-
school students in Whitwell, Tenn.,

took upon themselves one day while
learning about the Holocaust. Unable
to comprehend just how massive the
6 million person death toll was of
Jewish people, the students decided
to collect paper clips to help them
understand the magnitude of lives
lost. This project eventually grew to
11 million paper clips, 6 million to
representjews and 5 million to repre-
sent gypsies, homosexuals, and other
victims of the Holocaust, according
to the documentarys website.

The movement became so great
that it attracted global attention,
gained a name — the Paper Clips

Project — and led to the building of
a monument in their hometown.
The HillelJewish University Cen-
ter will bring the ﬁ1m’s producer,
writer and co-director Joe Fab for
a question—and-answer session and
screening of the “Paper Clips” docu-
mentary at 8:30 p.m. today. Fab has
spoken at events before, so the board
agreed his presence would add to the

screening, said Hillel president Becca '

Tanen, a junior at Pitt.

“It is particularly appropriate to,

have Holocaust education program-
ming during the month of Novem-
ber, during which the anniversary

of Kristalliiacht also falls,” Tanen
said.’ i J J 

Kristallnacht took place Nov. 9,
1938. The night marks the Nazi’s

destruction of 7,500 Jewish~owned 5

businesses, the burning of hundreds
synagoguesgthe murder of at least
91 Jewish people  thedeporta-

tion ofthousands ofjewish men to _

concentration ,c_amps_. , I

Fabbegan the ﬁlm after reading
a Washington Post article about the
original project. It took several weeks
to contact the‘school’s,principal and
teacher,‘ but1Fab was patiently de-
termined.

“We wanted to do this because ev-
eryone in our company [theJohnson
Group] loves stories about children,”
he said. “We had donelﬁlms for the
[United States] Holocaust [Memo-
rial] Museum in Washington, [D.C.]
That made me thinkabout how great
it would be to do something indepen-
dent of the institution.” . '

role in Holocaust education, said Mia

MUSIC COLUMN‘

Wagner: The fever overlustin Bieber is not a sickness

_

Patrick Wagner
Columnist

With soulful melodies, bumpin’
beats and a swooping haircut that
makes tweenage girls go crazy,
16-year-old Justin Bieber seems to
have taken over the world — and

you shouldrespect him for it- . .. _

When the Canadian po'p-R&B
artist got his start singing a.Ne—Yo
cover on YouTube at,the age of 12,
there was little indication that future

hits like “Baby”- and ‘7f.Somebody to

Love” would not onlyjt-l{_r;,>"p',t1‘aditional
charts but explodeiasisome of the

ﬁrst milestones in music indus- .
try’s transition to the Internet age. 1

Despite this success, Bieber has
faced waves of immature criticism
over everything from his young age
to his Twitter account. It needs to
stop. Even to this non-fan, Bieber’s
worth as a musician transcends
the hate directed toward him and
puts him in the tradition of other

* Wagner, admittedly not a fan of the tween pop sensation’s music, e

great young artists who sang soul-
ﬁilly while they were still in high
school.

When I ﬁrst heard about Justin
Bieberfrom the various monologue
jokes featured by late-night comedi-

ans, I had little idea of the social phe-

nomenon of which he was a part.
When I logged onto my Twit-

ter..account today, I was hit by? an ~-
astounding number of Bieber’s

thoughts from the road, retweets
from rabid fans and promotional
blurbs telling me to support his

mlatestfsingle. The whole appara-

tus seemsstrange andiforeigneand -

‘ perhaps is the origin of some of the

scorn directed at‘—Bieber. A g .
The Internet has been seen as the
perfect vehicle to connect those with
a passion for music to one another.
But its change from an underground
fan club to a legitimate moneymak-.
ing arm of the music industry has
made many who are otherwise
open—minded wary of what comes
from it. But aside from being super

plugged-in, which has made him the
target of 4chan and other Internet
haters, Bieber’s following a musical
tradition. ’

I’m in no way making a direct
comparison, but over 40 years ago
afamily from Gary, Ind., introduced
asimilar young singing sensation to
the world. Bieberis music isn’tjusta
direct descendent of the pop‘-R&B
tradition pioneered by MichaelJack—
son, but his musical celebrity owes
a certain something to the legacy
imparted upon young performers by
the monumental King of Pop.

At 16, Bieber sings songs, that
ﬁt with what’s going on in music

and also with what’s authentically

relatable for all ages. His particular

‘brand of love song might seem cli-

ché to some, but there is something
in his universal messages that’s

‘broadly appealing, and meanwhile

maintains aliigh level of artistry.
With the recent tween’boom

the ﬁnals will select the winner.
Linda Myers, Hillel JUC’s as-

- sociate director, stressed that the

auditions are meant for anyone
and everyone to get out there
and try.

“I don’t want people to be

intimidated and afraid to com-
pete,” she said. “Some of our past
winners were trained in singing
and are going to school for per-
formance, but we’ve had win-
ners who were biology majors
and English majors, and they’ve
blown us away.”-

Rocky Paterra, a freshman at
Pitt, willaudition for Campus
Superstar for the first time this
Thursday.

“I want to participate purely
because of how much I love per-
forming for an audience,” Paterra
said. “It’s one of those rushes that
can’t really be described, and I
take any opportunity I can to
perform.” 0

Paterra is no stranger to the
thrill of performance and is well-
versed in the ups and downs of
competition. '

In addition to being a member
of a campus a capella group, the
Pitt Pendulums, Paterra has also
auditioned for g“American Idol”
for the past three summers in
both Chicago and New jersey.

“The Idol auditions are crazy
intense,” he said. “I, like the ma-
jority of the auditioners, got sent
home during the preliminaries.
And while it was a lot of pain to
deal with seeing so many talent-
ed peoplelaround me get sent

' home while the ‘crazy people’ got

through to give the show its rat-
ings, I learned’ a,lot_about how to
deal with failure and rejection,”
Paterra continued. “It can’t be
taken to heart.”

But Paterra doesn’t simply
compete to be the winner, he en-
ters events like Campus Superstar
because. he loves performing.

“I never go into a competi-
tion expecting to go far or win,”
Paterra said. “It’s a great feeling
when you win a competition, but
staying grounded throughout will
make the victory all the more
meaningful. I expect that this

competition will be a fun time.”

Myers said this is a great time
for students to explore the world
of performing.

“It’s a lot of fun. The perform-
ers have a wonderful experience.
Most, even those studying drame
orlmusic, have never performed
in front of 1,500 people before.
Also, there will be some Holly-
wood talent scouts in the audi-
ence, and maybe some others
from the music industry,” shg
said. “And -of course there is
the cash reward of $5,000 for
the winner and $1,000 each for
the second and third place win-
ners.”

Paterra and Labosky both ex-
plained that while putting your-W
self out there to bejudged can be
scary, it can also be an exhilirat—
ing learning experience.

“You never know what people
are looking for,” Labosky said.

— “No matter how many times you

get down, you have to keep push-
ing yourself to get back up, and
the reward will surely be worth
the effort. It was for me.”

l but this isn’t a period piece. It’s about how we
are the generation now responsible for carrying
this legacy, and we have to acknowledge this is
a global issue,” she said.

Fab’s attendance at the screening will add to
the documentary and allow him to answer ques-
tions like why students today should continue to
care about issues from the past, Jacobs said.

“It’s my experience that it’s easy to be beat-
en down by Holocaust movies and education
because it’s so depressing and tragic,” Jacobs
said. “But we are in charge of this legacy. We
need to make sure people don’t forget. [We're
a] generation that has to remember and teach
the ﬁiture generations who‘won’t be able to
listen to survivors. I think ‘Paper Clips’ illus-
trates this well.” ' V

-Though the ﬁlm is also about the Holocaust
duringworld War II, the primary story in Fab’s
documentary is about the children in Tennessee
who wanted to go an extra step to learn.

“The children found they couldn’t say the

_ number and move on,” Fab said. “It was too

staggering. When people see the ﬁlm, they’ll
have known it had to do with the collecting
[of the paper clips], but they’ll ﬁnd it’s about a
lot more. The project was the trigger. But what
the children learn when they hear stories from
Holocaust survivors, when they decide to react
compassionately to what they learn, they decide
to do something.” '
Fab also believes that this documentary re-
veals the power these middle—school children

held, and this is a key point people can take .

from the ﬁlm today.
“Young people are treated as if they will be
ready to participate in life someday,” Fab said.

“They’re always in a state of getting ready. I
learned while working on this ﬁlm and being
around the kids that they were curious, compas-
sionate and very capable. They did something
to say they understood this, and they Wouldn’t
tolerate this sort of thing in aworld they’re cre-
ating. Imagine if you could bring scores of young
people into the mix and if they could contribute
at‘ the age the kids do in this ﬁhn. We could get
a lot more done if we engaged them.”

Fab hopes that the ﬁlm documentary he
has created will leave a lasting impression on
the audience. '

Though a newsarticle inspired him, the ﬁlm
medium alldws viewers to become more deeply
involved with the tragedy, he said. I v

“Reading is wonderful, but you add to this

the idea about whyl am pleased to be coming,” '

he said. “People experience it and go through
the emotions of the ﬁlm and -feel the emotions
of people in the room, and when it’s over we add
the idea that we’re going to talk. I think people
come away with different reactions.”

Fab also believes that this  will chal-
lenge college students, considering that middle-

school students began the project with almost 1

no ﬁinding.

Fab encourages college students to make
time to come to see the documentary.

“It’s easy to have something else to do, but
I’ve seen people get something from watching

V this ﬁlm,” he said. “You never know what will
happen, who will have an idea that will grow '

into something. I like to point out that when
the children were learning about the Holo-
caust, a student said, ‘Wait.’ That student started
something big.” I

Brothers become best sellers, I’ve wondered if
many of these artists who cater particularly to
young people would be able to sustain careers
without the support of Disney.
Bieber’s star power doesn’t come from
' his involvement in movies or television, but
instead it seems to be organically based on
how he performs, not just what he performs.
During this year’s VMAs he proved himselfto
be that kind of performer, dancing and singing

FOOTBALL -

Decicco plays versatile role for defense

Senior makes an impact playing a mix of safety, linebacker and nickelback for Panthers this ‘season.

. Roger Sepich
For The Pitt News

Dom DeCicco< is willing to do it all
for the Pitt defense.

The standout senior defender has
been everywhere for the Panthers
football team this season-—whether
it be making a diving interception
downﬁeld to keep Pitt in its game
against Miami or helping stuff the
vaunted Louisville rushing attack at

' the line of scrimmage, DeCicco has

shown he’s a versatile player.
The third-year starter, who is
one of the team’s ‘two true seniors

, (the otherbeing defensive endjabaal

Sheard), hailsfrom local football
powerhouse Thomasjefferson High
School and has been a staple in the
secondary ever since he won the
starting job at strong safety at the
beginning of his sophomore year.

‘ “Since I’ve been here, he has some
of the bestball skills I’ve seen,” junior
linebacker Max Gruder said.v“Having
him andjarred [Holley] back there
makes you feel a lot more conﬁdent
when the ball goes up in the air.”

Two seasons, seven intercep-
tions and a boatload of tackles later,

DeCicco entered his ﬁnal season as ,

a captain and the “quarterback” of
a stacked defense at safety on one
of the most highly anticipated Pitt
football teams in recent memory.
But after a disappointing 1-2

start, change was needed onboth'

sides of the ball. Defensively, it was
DeCicco’s athleticism, versatility and
experience that allowed defensive
coordinator Phil Bennett to unleash
the veteran on opposing offenses in
several different ways.

After playing the first three
games at his usual safety position,
a combination of injuries and altered
game-planningto prepare for spread
offenses resulted in DeCicco seeing
action at outside linebacker and
nickel comerback.

DeCicco says the “change in
physicality” was the biggest part of
the switch. .

“At linebacker, you have to deal

with linemen and react a little bit ‘

quicker,” he said. a
At 6 feet 4 inches and 230

‘ pounds, he’s shown he has the size

and quickness to help him make a
play in almostany situation.

The stats conﬁrm DeCicco’s abil-
ity to adapt. Three interceptions this

THRQWINGLA KIRSCH BALL:   A ’  

A listof some of the real ‘good guys’ in sports 9

World Series teams serve as a reminder that sports is full of warm—hearted athletes who give back to their communities

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staff Writer

Sometimes nice guys ﬁnish ﬁrst.
Sometimes they also ﬁnish sec-
ond. "l

That’s what I couldn’t help

thinking while watching the Gi— V-

ants celebrate their World Series
Championship on Monday night.

While I enjoyed watching San Fran-

cisco relish its victory, I couldn’t
help feeling for the Rangers, be-
cause both teams are ﬁlled with

the good guys. .

From Freddy Sanchez to Josh
Hamilton, -there are players on
both teams that sports fans just
can’t help but like. Then there are
the players like Randy Moss, who
declared to the media that he will
ask and answer‘ only his own ques-
tions from now on. In my annoy-
ance, I started thinking: Who are
the other good guys in professional
sports? ' _ l ' ’

Here are a few I came up with:

Warrick Dunn: The former
NFL running back for the ‘Bucca-

neers and the Falcons, Dunn was

— the.2005 Walter Payton Man of

the Year. He is the creator of the
Warrick Dunn Family Foundation
and the Homes for the Holidays
program. Through his charities,
Dunn helps single parents provide
homes for their families. So far,
Dunn has placed a down payment
on more than 90 houses, .for which
his sponsors have provided fur-
nishings. '

Alonzo Mourning: A retired

, NBA player, Mourning is the found-

er of Alonzo Mourning Charities,

Inc., and Zo’s Fund for Life. Alonzo
Mourning Charities, Inc., provides
aid to at-risk children while helping

a to develop families. Zo’s Fund for

Life is dedicatedto raising money
for research on the kidney disease
glomerulosclerosis, with which
Mourning was diagnosed.

Tim Duncan: The San Antonio
Spurs star is one of the best play-
ers in basketball, ‘but if you watch
for any antics, you won’t see them.
He’s not one to ‘pound his chest or

S mouth off to the media. You deﬁ-

nitely wouldn’t ﬁnd him hosting

— :2-
any decision specials on ESPN.

He’s laid-back and quiet, and on
a team full of nice guys, Duncan is
the leader: He does what he does,
and he shuts up about it. He’s also
the founder of the Tim Duncan

Foundation and was awarded the”

St. Croix Medal of Honor. Not bad
for a four—time NBA champion.

. Steve Nash: Seriously, how
can you not love Steve Nash? First
of all, he plays point guard the
way the position is supposed tg
be played. He makes the players
around him better, and as long as

DeCicco leads a resurgent Panthers defense

DeCicco< 11

season have brought his career tally
to 10, while he managed to record a
season-high 11'tackles against Notre
Dame and Louisville. In both games,
he was primarily used at linebacker
or nickel corner, positions he had
never played at Pitt prior to this
season. A
Most importantly, the Panthers

have recovered in the mostimpor- '

Max Gruder:

and a PIAA state championship.

Looking toward the rest of this
season, DeCicco isn’t ruling out
another tactical move when the
Panthers’ defense faces a spread-
offense style team, such as rival West
Virginia.

“I think we’ll keep doing what
we’ve been doing when we see a »
spread team,” he said. “I might move

“He can play Iinebackertme week and safety

since DeCicco beganhis transition.
“He’s skilled in so many areas,”
Gruder said. “He can play lineback-
er‘ one week and safety the next.’ It
shows you how athletic he is, how
great of a football player he is.”
Playing several positions isn’t ex-
actly new to DeCicco, whose brother
Brock is a redshirt—freshman tight
end. I
' I Dom spent time at quarterback,
wide receiver and safety during his
impressive highschool years, lead-
ing his school to two WPIAL titles

back to the nickel spot the way Ja-
son [Hendricks] and the guys are
playing.” .

Despite the fact that this is his
last season with the Panthers and
his atllleticism could help him ﬁnd
a spot on an NFL roster, DeCicco re-

, mains ﬁrmly focused on the current

campaign.

“I certainly hope my versatility
helps in the ﬁiture, but right now’
I’m just looking to win this Big East
and worried about Pitt,” he said, “We

A realize every game from here on out

is the biggest game of the season.” 5

his team wins, he doesn’t seem to
care whether he scores or not. He

was named the NBA MVP two years

in a row and he’s a seven-time NBA
All—Star..But his ego? It’s basically
nonexistent. He founded the Steve
Nash Foundation in 2001 to help
underprivileged children. And his
endorsement money from those
entertaining commercials we all
know and love? He used it to fund
a pediatric cardiology center in
Paraguay. Plus, he just seems like
he’d be so much fun to hang out
with.

Drew Brees: If you aren’t a die-
hard Indianapolis Colts fan, you
were probably rooting for Brees’
to win the Super Bowl last season.
And why not? He’s the epitome of a
good guy in the NFL. He threw him-
self into aiding with Hurricane Ka-
trina recovery, and with his Brees

Dream Foundation, is ‘teaming up
with Operation Kids to help rebuild
New Orleans. Saints fans call him
“Breesus.” Enough said.

Tony Dungy: The former Super
Bowl champion head coach isn’t

‘ just a nice guy, he’s the nice guy. If

there was an award for the nicest
guy in sports, Tony Dungy would
win it. And then he would turn
around and win it again. I mean,
honestly, in .a world ﬁillof head
coaches who seem like they can’t
scream enough at their players, the
recently retired Dungy didn’t yell.
He believes that faith and family
come ﬁrst, and his goal was always
to remain calm, to teach his players
instead of screaming at them. The
list of his charitable involvement is
long -— too long to list here, but
trust me -— the man has done plen-
ty of good for the community.

J

Hines Ward: I’m not a Steelers fan by any
stretch of the imagination, but I like Hines
Ward. It’s hard not to. I mean, the man is

hardly ever playing football without a smile -

on his face. It’s kind of hard to hate :1 guy
who is always grinning at you. Ward draws
some criticism for the hard hits he lays out,
but, it’s football, and hard hits are going to
happen. After he broke Keith Rivers’ j aw with
a hit in 2009, Ward made sure the message
was delivered that he was sorry Rivers was

hurt. As for charity work, the Hines Ward A

Korea. -

Albert Pujols: He’s arguably the best

player in baseball, and he’s also arguably‘

one of the sport’s nicest guys. Pujols is like
the anti-Barry Bonds. He’s not focused on
the numbers; his focusis on winning. And
he hasn’t been accused of using steroids,
which is a rarity itself in baseball, especially
for a player of Pujols’ caliber. He started the‘

Kevin Durant: I already wrote an entire
column about Durant, so I’ll keep this quick.
He’s one of the best scorers in the NBA. This
summer, he led the United States to aworld
Championship, and there’s a good chance
he’l1 end this NBA season as theleague’s MVP.
But here’s the catch: He doesn’t have LeBron

olf the court, he’s. quiet and humble. There’s
a surge of fame about to rush his way for ex-
actly that reason, so here’s hoping he doesn’t
turn into James 2.0. I, for one, like Durant
just the way he‘ is. '

There are more, I’m sure, that deserve ‘

mentioning. These are just a few'that came
to my mind. Once in a while, it’s refreshing to
look at the guys who give sports a good name.
So the next time there’s an arrest, a college

sports coaching scandal or Moss is ranting‘

at the media on your television, remember
that the nice guys are out there.

And as the Giants taught us, sometimes
those nice guys ﬁnish ﬁrst. !

prrr ADDRESSES SAFETY, CITATIONS, UNDERAGE DRINKING

By nauert run

The current discussion in the media and on campus of the
University of Pittsburgh’s student drinking-«related police
procedures presents anopportunity to clarify andexplaln the

. CUniversity’s position.

Pitt has long been a leader in its efforts to discourage underage
drinking. Just last year, in fact, the University’s successes “in  
promoting a vibrant intellectual and social campus climate that
de-emphasizes the role of alcohol” were recognized through the
receipt of the 2009 Gordie Award. That award is presented by six
major national higher. education organizations and is named in

. the memory of a University of Colorado undergraduate who died

of alcohol poisoning following a fraternity hazing incident.

From the outset of their Pitt educational experience, students are
informed that drinking to excess at any age endangers health,
jeopardizes academic success, undermines relationships, and,

more generally, does not mix well with anything. For example, i

Chancellor Nordenberg’s remarks at the most recent Freshman
Convocation included the following cautionary comments:
“Virtually every year, newspapers bring us stories of alcohol or
drug~related tragedies from other campuses. And occasionally,
we have witnessed such tragedies ourselves. in fact, just last

spring, a student from one of our regional campuses died from C

alcohol poisoning after participating in a party at a neighboring
campus, where he had earlier been a student. None of as needs

a an experienceliko thatto mar what otherwise should boa
. great year.” i C   is   C   C

P The Universltys  ofstudent Conduct states that “substance

abuse is amajor problem in our country” and advises that the  

University has established,a,.comprehensive policy concerning

the use and abuse of alcohol and other drugs. That code further
declares, “it is citlie utmost importance that each student read

   and is ‘familiar wrthruniversolly policies regarding alcohol and

  Cyiother C  ,   .

As in all matters involving students, health and safety are
Pitrs primary priority. in the area of alcohol abuse, that priority

i is reflected in the educational initiatives, alcohol-free social

activities, and counseling services supported by the University.
It also is reflected in the fact that the Pitt.Police respond swiftly

when they are called for assistance regarding an individual
who may require medical attention as a result of the excess
consumption of alcohol. '

it should be noted, however, that it also is the responsibility of
police officers to enforce the laws that havebeen enacted to

. promote public health and safety. Therefore, when the Pitt Police

are called to the scene to render assistance to someone younger
than 21 who has consumed alcohol to the point of requiring

‘ medical attention, they will meet that responsibility by issuing
a citation for underage drinking. when medics transport such

victims to the hospital, it has been the case, on rare occasions,
that the accompanying police officer, whose involvement began
in the field, has not been able to complete thecitation until after
the student has arrived atthe hospital. The listed location for the
issuance of the citation, then, would be the hospital.

C To be clear, however, reports that the Pitt Police assign officers to C

hospital emergency rooms in order to issue’ citations to underage
drinkers are simply incorrect. in fact,'UPMC contracts with the
Pitt Police to provide security support to hospital emergency
room staff. Officers functioning in this role do not issue citations
to underage drinkers. Furthermore, emergency room personnel
are prohibited from releasing personal medical information to
unauthorized individuals, including those police officers.

Historically, first-time underage drinkers have been treated
with understanding by local magistrates. Typically, the University
judicial board also has assessed first~tirne offenders minimal
fines, community service, andmandatory drug and alcohol
education classes.

‘i Clearly, the avoidance of a citation is never worth risking potential

long~term medical consequences, and students never should
hesitate to contact Pitt police when emergency care is needed.
it should be equally clear that the best approach, one advanced
by Pitt’s alcohol education programs and supported by virtually
every other form of public health information, is to use alcohol
responsibly and in accordance with governing laws and to

‘avoid ever being put in the position of having to take advantage

of these emergency services because of excessive or illegal

alcohol consumption.
