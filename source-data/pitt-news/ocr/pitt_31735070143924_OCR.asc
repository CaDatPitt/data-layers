White House adviser: Obama best for national security

by Alie Gensheimer _
For T be PittNew.1

A speaker in the Barco Law
Building last night asked the quesﬁon:
“Which candidate is better for national
security?” But there _was certainly no
doubt in the speakers mind _

Richard A. Clarke, 21 former senior
White House adviser and coordinator
for security and counterterrorism, is a
starmch Obama supporter

“Whatever you might think about
national security, I’d like to ask you to
rethinkit,”saidClarkeinhis speech,
which was part of the .Matthew B.
Ridgway Speaker Series.

Clarke said many Americans
are skeptical of Obama’s, lack of
experience in dealing with national
security but that .that’s not the 
factor for him ‘

‘Tm not looking for the best
resume, but for the best judgment,”

Clarke said that if a resume were
' the most signiﬁcant factor 
a politician “on national security,'thén
Vice president Dick Cheney would be
considered an expert
He also said a_“myth” that John
McCain is knowledgeable ‘about
national security “has penetrated [the]
national psyche.” '

‘ Clarke said that he thinks McCain
has made poor decisions 
national security since Sept; 11, 2001,
when he immediately supported the
Bush administration’s decision to
invade  ' .

In contrast, Obama, who was

_ an Illinois state legislator at the time,

opposed the war,  that it could

reduce his chances of becoming state
senator, said Clarke. , . g _

Clarke” continued to 

. Obama. He said that theiDemocratic
candidate realizes the need to ‘

bring more American troops into

McCain, on the other hand, said
that Americans will “muddle through”
our issues in  without

A providing a speciﬁc plan of action,
according toiClarke.

Clarke said he believes that Obama
pays  attention to the threat
that Osama bin Laden poses to
America’s  C

Obama plans to go after bin
Laden it-he ends up in Pakistan and

‘Pakistanis won’t or can’t hunt him'

down themselves, saidClarke.‘ '
However, Clarke ‘said McCain

. called Obamas plan an “amateur

move” and said that Pakistanis need

- to assert their independence without _ 

American troops  . ,

The last- “myth” that Clarke

debunked was that Obama doesn’t

careaboutorlikediemilitary. 7
‘The myth that McCain is an

expert on national security and_ cares

about thehﬁﬁtary is just that — it’s a ‘

Political Point-Counterpoint: To drill or not to drill  

Oﬂdbore drilling could ﬁe a comp/romiere

by Shane Levy
Cola/mzirt

Forthepast30years,bothDemocratsand
Republicans have been adamant in their support
of American energy independence. Accordingly,
it is no coincidence that in the 2008 presidential
election, both Sen. Barack Obama and Sen.]ohn
McCain have been more than forthright in their
plans to make the United States a more eriergy—
independmt nation. '

Obarria and McCain share very similar energy
planslneadiof theirrespectiveenergypolices,
both would  reduce carbon emissions,
increasetheuseofcleanooaltechnology,irivestigate
and increase the usage of alternative mergy
sources ——  solar and wind power and
expandtheuseof nuclearenergyMoreover,both
candidates have supported the hot button and
highly controversial issue of offshore 

Although the development of oﬁshore
drilling poses beneﬁts for Americans by 
reducingAmericas dependence on volatile, African
and Middle Eastern nations for oil, offshore 
should not be paramount to the expansion of

It’s not often that an art form as strictly tradi-
tional as ballet, a story as  tragic as “Ro-
meo and Juliet” and music as starkly modem as
alternative rock collide, but when they do, it makes
for  results

Tonight Pittsburgh art patrons will witness
just such an intersection of genres with the US.
premiere of “Radio and Juliet,” a reinterpretation
of the Shakespeare story set to music by the rock
band Radiohead, performed by the Romanian
dance company Ballet Maribor. The performance
marks the opening of Pit1sburgh’s International
Festival of Firsts

Choreographer and principal dancer Edward
Clug is the creative mind behind the unusual pair-
mgr

“Their music and the atmosphere they create
opened me to a specific dimension,  offered
me the possibility to analyze and reflect on this
popular story,” he said of the inspiration to use
Radiohead as a backdrop for “Romeo and Juliet”

‘ ‘I don’t know exactly when it happened I was

not  about Radiohead and ‘Romeo and
Juliet’ at the same time,” he explained. “I was com-
ing from a classical background, but I’ve been a
fan [of Radiohead] for more than 15 years What
they create  their music, it suits my way of
thinki 'ng Especial.” lywhen their [album] ‘Hail to the
Thief’ came out, I was totally convinced I would
do a performance on them.”

But the performance today did not come to
fruition  or easily Clug said that he fo-
cused first on the movements, rather than on the
story,.and he built up sequences around the move-
1’1'1€f1tS.

“I allowed myself a lot of freedom, 21 lot of
interpretation,” he said. “I wasn’t really influenced
that much by the music itself I ﬁrst concentrate on
the movement It doesn’t have  to do with
the story. Then when you set these movements in

And as if the inclusion of modern rock didn’t
change the story enough, Clug emphasized that it’s
not the traditional “Romeo and Juliet’ ’ told from
beginning to end. The performance is set up in
ﬂashbacks and ﬂames rather than one linear sto-
ryline. And Clug focuses mainly on the character
of Juliet;

“One  moment that caught my at-
tention is when Juliet wakes up next to Romeo’s
dead body. I stop at the moment somehow,” said
Clug “I experienced the project as a prolongation
of this moment, a delicate journey of this lost
woman,toapointof noreturn,waitingforan
ideal love,  to complete her love.”

While this weekend’s performances mark the
ﬁrst time the production graces a US. stage, Bal-
let Marbor toured around the worid performing
“Radio and Juliet” more than 70 times in two
years \X71th such a successful run for a relatively
new piece, Clug stated that the public response has
been nothing but “fantastic,” especially in the face
of the pieces  position

“I like the public  about what he’s see-
ing, and not offering him a story that he already
knows so well,” added Clug

appeared on, the ever—popular ”Grey’s
Anatomy” — will be slightly shocked by
Acid Tongue, as it is far more a folksy alt-
country album than anything heard on

That’s not to say that Acid Tongue is any-
thing short of entrancing. From the open-

but poppy “Black Sand,” to the piano—lad—
en ﬁnisher “Sing a Song,” Lewis crafts an
engaging,’ fun musical experience.

However, the shining moments of Acid

album. The songs where Lewis allows her

insecurities to fall to the wayside and com— _

F Tights being summer style into fall fashion

7 .
Know“

l“;

by Julia Nauer
Co/mu/zziwf

   

 

Now that the weather’s  a little chillier,

whats a girl to do_with her poor bare legs peeking
out under her skirts and dresses?

\‘-“car tights, of course!

Tights are the perfect cold weather comple-
ment to expand your summer and fall wardrobe
well into winter, and they are an easy way to up-
date your look quickly and inexpensively.

i They also look absolutely trendy with ladylike
high—waisted skirts and rufﬂed blouses to evoke a

feminine ’40s and ’50s feel.

I used to think that stockings and pantyhose
were interchangeable words, but after some quick
research l’ve discovered that stockings are two in-
dividual articles of clothing (one for each leg) that
are usually held up by a  belt or other means
Pantyhose, or tights, are the more modern ver-

sion, apparently combining the words “panties”

and “hosiery.” F

Pantyhose can elicit some pretty negative con-
notations: itchy, binding, old—fashioned, boring.
But kick those thoughts to the curb because the
tights on the market right now are not yo’ rnama’s

hose

If you travel to The Galleria in Mt Lebanon
or just peruse Anthropologiecom, you’ll find that
Anthropologie features one of the widest selec-
tions of color and patterns that you’ve ever seen
of rights '

Patterns range from tiny white bows on black

opaque lights to a brown herringbone tweed pat-
tern There are polka dots and geometric shapes

like lavender diamonds on a sheer, chocolateé

colored  keeping with the theme of ﬂoral for

, fall and winter Anthropologie also carries a dark

opaque tight decorated with a pretty ﬂoral pattern

that is sure to help your outﬁt blossom on a de
pressing winter day. _

Don’t think those will keep you toasty enough}
Try the sweater tights in brown, black, navy, white
or another version with pointelle arrows in darlt
gray, moss and rose

 to attempt the lace trend on a smal
scale? Try all the pretty crocheted varieties to ﬂask
alittleleginaclassyway. 

Get back to basics with Anthropologie’s
of essential opaque tights for $12.50.

You’ll want one a different candy—colored hue
for each day of the week. Colors include navy, tur-

quoise, chartreuse, medium pink rose, light gray -H

gray, dark gray, dark orange, dark purple, brown
black and sky. '

And ﬂatter your stocking feet with Anthro
pologie’s frilled ankle boots in red suede, another
fun trend for the lower half of your body.

American Apparel" is another top destinatior I

for tights in a rainbow of colors AmericariiAp

parel’s opaque tights are similar in price to Anthro .

Two weeks after announcing
the contract extension of Pitt men’s
basketball coach Jamie Dixon, Pitt
athletic director Steve Pederson an-
nounced that Pitt women’s basketball
coach Agnus Berenato was getting an
extension of her own

  off Pitt womer1’s first-
ever Sweet 16 appearance, Berenato
received a three—year contract exten-
sion on Thursday afternoon

Berenato’s new extension will keep
her on the Pitt sidelines through at

‘ least the 2015-16 season. Athletic di-

rector Steve Pederson did not irnme—
diately release the ﬁnancial details of
the contract extension, but it will in-
clude a raise t:hat might put her among
the top third of Big East coaches, ac-

- cording to a report by the Pittsburgh

Post—Gazette.

Berenato joined Pitt in 2003 after
spending 15 seasons at Georgia Tech.
In her five years at Pitt, Berenato has
led the Panthers to an 89-66 record
She helped rebuild the program ﬁorn
the Big East cellar to the top tier of
the conference

Last season, she coached Pitt to a
24-11 overall record and went 10-6 in
the Big East. For the second straight
year, Pitt made the NCAA Tourna-

‘ rnent, producing wins against Wyo-
‘  and Baylor to reach the Sweet

16.

Pitt men’s soccer coach Joe

Luxbacher expected a battle when_ -_.-my

his Panthers visited West Virginia
on Wednesday.

He got one.

On a rainy night in Morgan-
town, W Va., the Pitt men’s soc-
cer team finished with a 1-1 tie
against its rival at Dick Dlesk
Soccer Stadium.

Mountaineer senior Alex Yost
scored his first goal of the season
and the only point of the game
for West Virginia. Yost put the
Mountaineers ahead in the 38th
minute off of a pass from Paul
Paradise.

The Panthers didn’t put a point
on the scoreboard until the 84th
minute, when junior Mike Mc-
Dade scored on a penalty kick.

. Luxbacher was proud of his
team’s effort while coming from
behind.

“Our guys came back,” said
Luxbacher. “We were down 1-0.
They kept fighting and finally
made a tying goal. Their goal-
keeper made a couple of huge
saves, or we would have won the
game.”

Although Pitt was outshot, 20-
10, in the match, it had six more
shots on goal than West Virginia.

The Panthers ﬁred eight of
their 10 shots in the second pe-
riod, but only McDade’s penalty
kick got by West Virginia goal-
keeper Zach Johnson. Johnson
tallied eight saves in the game.

“We ended up getting a point
out of the game,” said Luxbach—
er. “You’d like to get a win, but
getting a point at West Virginia is
not a bad result.”

The Mountaineers just came
off a 1-0 upset over nationally

Sharing safeties Q

by Tony Ferraiolo
Senior Staff l/Writer

Entering the season, sophomores Dom
DeCicco and Elijah Fields were engaged in a
heated positional battle. DeCicco won the job

after camp but played poorly against Bowling '

Green and Buffalo to start the season, and
Fields took over asthe starter against Iowa.

However, Fields didn.’t wow the coaches
as the starter, and against South Florida
DeCicco was once again the starter. But both
players were on the ﬁeld together most of
the game as Pitt played a lot of nickel defense
to combat South Florida’s proliﬁc spread of-
fense, and both players performed well.

“We went from three weeks ago, being
uncertain if either guy could get it done when
he had to, to now being conﬁdent that we
have two guys back there that we feel com-
fortable playing, and we kind of look at both
of them as starters,” said Pitt coach Dave
Wannstedt. _

It’d be safe to assume that there’s some
contention between DeCicco and Fields, but
actually, it’s the polar opposite.

“We really are best friends. I’m with him
every day,“ said DeCicco. “We never talk
about us playing. We know me and him could
be playing together for a while and that’s what

we’re looking forward to, and we’re just try- «-

McCoy on being No. 1 in the Big

Being at the top feels so much better than 
being at the bottom — as long as it’s not the _l

running back LeSean McCoy. ‘._

“It’s kind of cool. Everything is work-

ing in your favor because you control y6ur '

destiny,” said McCoy. “But I would rather be I
second. I don’t want to be at the top. I don’t v_

Will the NBA ever
come to Pittsburgh?

by Zack Chakan
At/dzirtzzrzt Sparta E9[tor

 

3§.\

I was  at McFadden’s on the North Side
one night last month,  sortie college foot-
ball blowout, when the disc  almost gave me
a concussion.

‘As a ploy to get the party started, along with
some Ne—Yo, of course, he announced to the
crowd that NBA commissioner David Stem pub-
licly stated that he wanted to see a professional bas-
kethall franchise in Pittsburgh

A loud cheer blared over the bar The problem
was, the only signiﬁcant roar of approval came
ﬁom my own mouth, and I was so excited that I
neady toppled off my stool.

I rushed home later that night to surf the web
for any of these comments What did I ﬁnd?
Nada ’

Perhaps this news wasn’t substantial enough to
ﬁlter through the Internet and blogosphere, -or at
least to generate excitement I began to wonder if
Stern actually made that statement

But then, a more pressing and perplexing ques-
tion appeared. Why did no one in McFadden’s
seem to care?

Pittsburgh is a proud sports town, with the
perpetual dominance of the Steelers, excitement
for the Penguins and history (although not at all
recent) of the Pirates But basketball has never
made it in the Steel City to complete the quartet of
professional sports in Pittsburgh

My question is: Why?

On Tuesday, the defending champion Boston
Celtics will square off against the Cleveland Cava-
liers at the Petersen Events Center in an exhibition
contest

~ Four of the sport’s biggest stars will grace the
court Boston’s prestigious tiiumvirate of Kevin
Garnett, Ray Allen and Paul Pierce take on the
new face of basketball, LeBron]ames

Sure, it’s only a preseason game But that’s a
heck of a lot of NBA talent showing up to Pitts-
burgh Even if they all play only 20 minutes apiece,
witnessing a few ﬁiture Hall of Famers for per-
haps the only timeinpersonwould bewellworth
the ticket price

But will Pittsburghers show up? Would they
showupifPittsburghhadateamofits own?
Does the city even care about basketball?

It has to One indicator comes from the venue
right here on campus, the Petersen Events Center.

“The Pete” holds 12,508 fans and sold out six

of nine Big East games last year. The other three

contests all came close to  at full capacity.

The atmosphere at Pitt basketball games is ti-
diculous The Oakland Zoo sets the tone, but it’s
not just the student section that gets riled up. Every
fan in that building screams his support when Pitt’s
on defense or in the closing minutes of a contest

After years of mediocre basketball at best, Pitt
initiamd its renaissance under Ben Howland in the
2001-02 season, the first of seven straight NCAA
Tournament appearances

The program is attracting more and more
baskethallﬁ1nstothearea.ItalsoheIpsthatPitts—
burgh’s other Division I schools, Duquesne and

Robert Morris, are also recruiting quality players

and  their teams rise bad: to prominence

Another factor simply comes from the popu-
larity of basketball. The game is incredibly easy to
organize and play in one’s spare time All you need
is a ball and a hoop.

There’s a court behind my apartment, and I
never get the opportunity to shoot a few innocent
hoops because it’s always taken. Games are played
constantly at Trees Hall and other places around
campus .

People here love basketball. I know it I can
sense it So why would Pittsburgh not support an
NBA franchise?

One argument is the lack of any kind of histo-
ry. The Steelers, Pirates and Penguins are legendary

Football

by Jay Huerbin
Staﬂ Writer

The No. 24 Pittsburgh Panthers are off
this week as they prepare to take on Navy
next Saturday afternoon in Armapolis. No.
19 South Florida and Connecticut also have
byes this week.

That means only ﬁve Big East teamsare
on the gridiron this weekend, including two
conference games. With Big East play in full
swing, this is the time for programs to jockey
for wins and conference positioning.

Here are some previews for the Big East
games over the weekend.

Louisville at Memphis

The first Big East team to see action this
weekend will be the Louisville Cardinals (2-2,
0-1 Big East), as they travel to Memphis to-
night to take on Conference USA opponent
Memphis (3-3, 1-2 C-USA).

Senior quarterback Hunter Cantwell
powers the Cardinals’ offense, which looks
to rebound following its 26-21 loss to Con-
necticut two weeks ago.

For the Tigers, junior running back Cur-
tis Steele, whose 578 yards put him third in
the conference in rushing yards, should see
most of the action. Memphis started the sea-
son 0-3 but has since found success, winning
three in a row. .

Louisville will play Middle Tennessee
next week, before finishing off the season
with six consecutive games against Big East
opponents.

Syracuse at West Virginia

In the first of two Big East matches this
weekend, West Virginia (3-2, 1-0 Big East)
will host a struggling Syracuse team (1 -4, 0-1
Big East) on Saturday at noon.

The Mountaineers, V who suffered two

October 10, 2008

Crucial conference  
battles over Weekend

consecutive losses a few weeks into the
season, have rebounded with two wins in a
row. v

Senior quarterback Pat White, who leads
the conference in rushing yards by a quar-
terback, is responsible for much of the
turnaround. White has 428 rushing yards
through ﬁve games, only 26 behind running
back Noel Devine for the team lead.

White suffered a head injury in last
week’s 24-17 victory over Rutgers, but coach
Bill Stewart said he should be fine for this
game.

For Syracuse, defensive problems have
plagued a team that has given up an average
of more than 30 points per game. Tailback
Curtis Brinkley paces the Orange offensive
attack, with 477 yards on the ground. .,

Rutgers at Cincinnati

The Rutgers Scarlet Knights (1-4, 0-1 Big
East) travel to Cincinnati on Saturday to take
on a Bearcats (4-1, 0-0 Big East) team that is
looking to kick off Big East play with a win.

Cincinnati has lost only one game this
year: a 52-26 defeat to then No. 4 Okla-
homa, now ‘the top team in the country. It

bounced back to win three straight contests 1

after that loss and is the last team to start
conference play. if

After suffering injuries to the'quarter—
backs Dustin Grutza and Tony Pike so far
this year, the Bearcats have turned to red-
shirt freshman Chaz.z Anderson to lead the
team. Anderson started the last game against
Marshall and threw two touchdowns and ran
for another. '1

Rutgers is still searching for an identity.

Senior quarterback Mike Teel still anchors .

the offense for the Scarlet Knights, who have
gotten off to a poor startin 2008. Receiver
Kenny Britt already has 33 catches this sea-
son but has yet to record a touchdown. .~ 5
