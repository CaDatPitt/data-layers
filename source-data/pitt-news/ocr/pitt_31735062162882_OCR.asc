Many Purposes
Considered At t
SGA Banquet *

By HARRIET A. WEHNER

“What can the new Student
Government do for Stu-
dents?” This "is thequestion

that was given primary con-

sideration atthe SGA Ban-
quet last Wednesday.

' -Following his inauguration into
oﬂice as president of the student
body, Chuck Is'1er said, “My main
desire -during this term of .ofﬁ.c.e
will be to have the co_operation’of
all students in regard to the work-

~ ings of ‘SG- ;

“A strong consideration must be

. given .to.- student problems, with

emphasis on cooperation with fac-
ulty _and- administration in order
for SG to work smoothly.”,
, Jarrell‘ Gives Report _
Following the dinner Kent Jar-
rell, past president-of SGA, gave
his ﬁnal report. Brieﬂy, he gave
the following summary of what
has been done in the past year by

‘SGA: establishment of SGA as the

ﬁrst court at the university; the
participation ofstudents in fresh-
men orientation" week at Wild-
wood.
Clariﬁcation of the use of al-
coholic beverages on campus;
increase of_ campus bus
service; progress on the student
-handbook; library. hours on
Sunday: and a new constitution
enabling i new type of govern-
ment to be established at the
university’. ' ‘
However, when it came to the
question of what SG can do in the
future, Jarrell said, “SG can do
anything that you want it to do.”
-Now Is the Time
Concerning the judicial system,
Jarrell said that since the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee decided
last May that "they wanted a stu-
dent court system on campus, they
have done little in the way of es-
tablishing it. “Now is the time to
start working on establishing an
eﬂicient court system.” ‘
Jarrell also said, “In the past,
the relationship between SGA
and the faculty and administra-
tion has been mainly that of our
"setting our course of action on
a basis of what we think they
think. . .
“We should set our own course,

Rowney said, ‘-‘If Men’s Council

to materialize the idea. Likewise,
if there is some phase of the uni- ‘
versity that the council dislikes, it
should state its position publicly.
“Furthermore, thePitt campus A

ganization to aid students and .

dean of admissions, who was guest
speaker at the banquet. The title
of his speech was “Little Brief

3 Two Reasons
Adams said that there are one
thousand and one ways to serve
humanity and two of them would
be very effective at this univer-

sity. SG can serve the university ‘

by helping to establish an aca-
demic climate on campus.

For example, instead of tak-
ing an evaluation of teachers
which could be damaging to Va’
sensitive faculty member, pos-
sibly we could take a poll on
how in some courses the work is
spread out over the whole tri-

secretary of SGA and Bob Fulton,

the student body as a whole if
we could dispense with some of
‘these things‘ that are not a
credit to the university.

The other ﬁeld in which SG can
be very effective is in developing
loyalty to the school, a loyalty
that would last from the day a
student steps on the campus till
the day they die.

SG should try to include the ad-
ministration and faculty in as
many ways as possible. “Make
mistakes —' it is better to try and
blunder than just continue in this
apathetic. rout,” said Adams in
conclusion to his speech.

Awards Made

Two awards were made by Jar-
rell to the students who kept SGA
in mind by being informed on
how the student body felt, and in-
forming the student body on what
SGA was trying to do for them.
They were: Brenda McCurdy, past

past judicial chairman of SGA.

Hall-Guzik

Tom Hall and Bob Guzik
came through with big'vic-
tories which enabled Rex
Peery’s matmen to gain their
seventh victory of the season
with a 19-11 win over power-

ful Lehigh. Hall’s victory in the
191-pound division gave the Pan-

-z-thers at least a tie and Guzik’s win

in the heavyweight class wrapped
it up for the Peerymen.

Lehigh, the team that handed,

the Cats their only setback of the
year last season, had a rough time
getting here because of the snow
storm which has hit the Eastern
States. And they found the going
pretty rough at the Field House
Saturday night as the Panthers
were out for" blood.

As usual the-.Blue and Gold
started out with victories in the
first two weight classes. Mighty

/Mites Dick Martin and Larry

Lauchle gave the Cats a 8-0 lead‘
with a forfeit in the 123—pound
class and a 11-2 win in the 130-
pound division by Lauchle.

But , then Daryl Kelvington,
who was undefeated and untied_
in eight matches, was held to a
draw by Curt Alexander of Le-
high. Kelvington was ahead in
the ﬁnal period when Alexander
gained three_points for a near
fall. The -score ended 4-4. .

' Bill Robb, who had moved from
the 157 pound class to 147 for the
Panthers, was beaten by , Bob
Gunst 8-1. Then John Zolikoff,
usual 147 pounder, decisioned
Sterling Snowden 4-1. Zolikoff
was about 11 pounds lighter than
Snowden. ' .

The Panthers lost the next two
classes when Dave -Angeli of Le‘-

high downed August Arrigone,

14-6, and .Thad Turner beat.Pan-
ther Len Vuocolo, 4-1. ~ At this
Hall
‘and Guzik then came up with their
much needed victories to save the
day for the Peerymen.

63-32 Victory .

Over Syracuse

 Despite two Syracuse University

records set by Jack Nesbitt, the

Blue and Gold tankers -"returned-

' Orangemen.

Nesbitt swam the 220 and 400-
yard free s_tyle in times of 2:15.1
and 4:58, breaking the existing
Syracuse records in these events.

It was Jim _Emert again who
lead the Panthers to their second
victory of the season. Emert scor-
ed his customary double victory
in the 50 and 100, and also swam
on the winning freestyle relay.

Kevin Keller and Jerry Irwin
swept diving, ﬁnishing, 1-2 re-
spectively. Irwin also swam on
the victorious medley relay.

Co_-captain Pat F i t 2 g er a l d
chalked up a twin killing for the
Aquatic Cats by capturing the
200 medley and the 200,back-

The Cub 'hoopsters returned
home from Morgantown as the
sixteenth victim of the Moun-

vroundball squad. The 113-91 loss
was thesecond inflicted on the
Panthers by Rod Thorn and Co.

It was the eleventh time in their
sixteen games ‘that the WVU
Frosh twirled the twine for more
than 100‘points. ‘In the previous
encounter of the two teams, the
Field House , Flashes held-' the
high-flying roundballers from the

also" tied individual EIGL , and

Jungle‘ Cats to a 71-25 victory
over a weak Georgia Tech squad

at the Field House last Friday _

By scoring ﬁrsts on the side
horse, ‘high bar, and parallel bars,
-Kasner thus became the ﬁrst
gymnast in Panther. history to
capture three events in a dual
meet. His outstanding accomplish-
ment also tied Eastern and Na-
tional dual meet standards.

When asked if it was the hap-
piest moment of his gym career
Kasner replied, “You might say
that this is something that I’ve

ing toward the only claim to fameé

that Pittsburgh basketball teams
receive, but_ the Cats would equal
last years’ 10-14 record if they
bring home a victory.

With only a home game with
Penn State and an; away. game
with Kentucky remaining, the
Panthers stand a better chance
against Tech than either of their
remaining opponents.

Tough" Tech

Yet Tech is not a team to be
sold down the river. On a given
night the Tartans can stay with
the best of them. “Tech blows hot
and cold,” Coach Bob Timmons
said.,“If they are hitting against
us we could have a lot of trouble.”

-The Tartans usually shoot
well from the outside, especial-
ly on their .own court. Tim-
mons will most likely go with a
man—to-man and stick Bill
Mauro on Tech’s record setter,
Bill Soﬁa.

Soﬁa, a junior, seems destined

to set almost every record on the’

Tech books. The Tartans, al-
though not tall, possess a lot of
speed.

Mauro Praised
Timmons praised Mauro for do-
ing a fine job against West Vir-
ginia’s Lee Patrone in the Pan-
thers 89-75.loss to the Mounties

Saturday night. ‘

“They -were just too fast and
had too ’much West.” Timmons
commented. “He has tobe con-
sidereda great ball-player. We
just couldn’t handle him.” West
scored 29 points in playing his
last game -against‘ the Panthers
and his last in Morgantown.

Last week against Miami of

Ohio at the Field House, the Pan-
thers managed to gain a narrow
83-79 victory.
