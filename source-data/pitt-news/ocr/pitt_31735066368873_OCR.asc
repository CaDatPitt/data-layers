Students who now receive
senatorial scholarships to help
pay for their education are
going to have to look for money
somewhere else after the end of
the year. The Pennsylvania
Senate voted 31 to 17 to end-the
scholarship program Monday’
night. '

Francis M. Dutkovich, Jr.,
director of student aid, said the
$700,000 loss of funds to Pitt

~ /students caused by the termin-
ation of the scholarships could
have some impact among
recipients here. “Approxi-
mately 50 percent of the
students receiving senatorial
scholarships showed need for
aid,” said Dutkovich.” The

other 50 percent never applied
for aid.“ .

Harry Patchin, a scholar-
ship recipient at Pitt, said the

loss of the $300 a term he _

received would hurt, but that he
could still continue in school
without it, if he trimmed some
extras from his budget.
“Three hundred dollars does

‘ help,” he said. “What they're

doing now does hurt.”
The Senate’s move to abolish

.the scholarships comes after
reports

in the Philadelphia
Inquirer and other Pennsyl-

-vania newspapers revealed

cases of political favoritism in
the dispenstion of the awards.

Legislators opposing abolish-
ment denied the charges ~~of
abuses during debate on the

I

resolution. .
“I resent the implication of
politics,” said Sen. Eugene.
Scanlon, Dem.-Northside. This
is a worthwhile program. I
think we should keep it.”
Patchin said his experience
did not show the charges of
favoritism to be true. He said I
he received a scholarship for
two years form a senator. who
has since died he never even
knew. A
0 “The first time I got a
scholarship, I" just called the
senator and asked if any were
still available. The senator sent
me an application and I just
ﬁlled it out,” he said. -
Patchin admitted his family
has some cohnection with Sen.
George Gekas. Rep.-Dauphin,

who gave Patchin a grant this
year. ‘ "

“The senator who I get a

, scholarship from now my father
knew personally, but I know
other people in my area who got
them from Gekas, and Gekas
would not know them.”

Under the 97-year-old pro-
gram, the 50 state senators
could dispense as many as 96-
annual scholarships to students

» attending the University of
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania State
University, Temple University,
the University of Pennsylvania
and‘Lincoln University. Sena-
tors could choose to award 24
four-year grants or divide their
scholarship into one-year
grants or divide their scholar-
ships into one-year grants to

across his face, “there are the Greeks.”

Oehling have been fraternal for some 10 years. He has been

by his formal association with no fewer than nine Greeks

“It began in 1972,” begins Oehling, “with a group of
Pikas (Pi Kappa Alpha) -- a good group.

‘ ‘I had known them from working at the Luna, ” he says.
“And the crew of ’72 asked me to come into the fraternity.

‘ So I was initiated as a Pika, and then some of the others

followed suit -- Delta Phi, Delta Sigma Chi, Phi Kappa
Theta, Sigma Chi and then, Delta Tau Delta.

says. “I loved it . . . theyweregreat people.

John D. Ehrlichman, convicted
Watergate conspirator and former
chief counsel for domestic affairs
under Richard Nixon will speak on
“Why We Choose the Presidents
We Do,” tomorrow night at 8 p.m.
in David Lawrence Hall.

Ehrlichman will begin his stop in
Pittsburgh tomorrow afternoon
with a question-and-answer session
Theodore
Windt’s Presidential Rhetoric
class.

Some controversy arose over the
funding of Ehrlichman’s speech
with student money ~when a

Pitt student blasted-the_.Pitt Union p

Programming Council for bringing

Ehrlichman to the University.

In a letter to the PUPC, Walter J.
Burke criticized the committee for
“using student funds on a felon

and helping him to become rich,

from his criminal activity.”. Burke
accused Ehrlichman of participa-
ting in spying activities against
student protest organizers in the
1960s as well as ordering the arrest
of students at the May Day

celebration in ,Washington, D.C.

Burke also doubted the educational
value of bringing Ehrlichman to

charges of poor usage of PUCP
money.

“In bringing Ehrlichman to
campus we first considered the
goals set up by the PUPC, one of
which is to‘provide a well balanced
programming base within which a

‘variety of programming interests

andpeople can be met,” Haddad
said. ’

Haddad added that because of
the position held by Ehrlichman he
might be able to offer views from a
different perspective than that
through which many students look
at the presidency.

“We’re,not justifying or condon-
ing his actions,” Haddad said.

Ehrlichman resigned in April ‘Of

Ehrlichman was also cited for his

When city. ofﬁcials recently

»  pushed for funds to install a new
 emergency phone’ system, they

‘.li- picked up on‘ idea the Pitt
5-ji‘,=ca'mpus police have used for
'71’:‘ifﬁve' years.

' Pitt’s emergency system,

" visible by the yellow boxes

I placed around campus, has

' been in operation for the past

five years. The phones" are

-’ beneﬁcial to the students, says

Pitt Police Sgt. James Walters,
because they are “a good
working instrument for people
in isolated, less travelled
areas.”

Waters said there are pres-
ently 81 phones ‘on campus,

A: ‘I. '1 and six more are to be installed

soon. Some of the boxes are
tied into a computer, according
A to Waters, “that by pressing a

 communications (between the
"caller

and the police) by
"activating the computer.” The
other boxes have standard
telephones.

The city is interested in the

cause it is more effective in
dealing with emergencies, and
because the city’s fire alarm
system hasbegun to fail ‘and
would cost over $1 million to
repair.

Hayllar said that, although
the University was consulted
about their emergency phone
setup, the “initial instigation”
to look into such a system was
not because of Pitt’s phones.

“‘We knew Pitt had a small
(phone) system, and of course
we checked with them because
they’re in the city,” said

Hayllar, “but we’re following a

national

ﬁreboxes. .
“We checked with fourteen

institutions_and cities that have

trend to renovate

_ emergency phone hook-ups on

a smaller scale than whatwe
plan.”

Hayllar cited Miami and New
Orleans as two cities whose
systems were studied in depth.

Pending '
$505,000‘ in.funds, the city
plans to install‘ .,1,500 emer-
gency phones on street corners
by the end of 1979, including
corners on the campus. .

Hayllar said plans for the

approval of,

 stuff before the culture. (He never took a patent on the
process.) '

A , ~,i “I also thought of adding a union to the place, though,”

I

he says witha laugh, “so I didn’t stay too long after tha .”
‘j After the term as chauffeur, Oehling went to the Luna
and managed the lower bar. He moved to Haddon Hall
(“thé"i*eal name is D.J”."s, but nobody knows that”) and

“‘they (the Greeks) all came with me. That's where the
fraternalism between me and the Greeks formed. I had all of

I their paddles_up behind my bar.”

4 Oehling went from Haddon Hall to Gustine’s, a place that

suits him -well.

Nor are abroad slice of persons associated with Pitt. ‘ ‘_I even
’ get some of the old Oaklanders -- those who haven’t died
off,” he says. v . . ' ‘

While associated with that prominent banking family? ,
Oehling turned part of his. attention toward ‘the county
sheriff’ s ofﬁce. “I joined the auxilliary deputies in the
mid-60s,” he says, “and later I was elected sheriff of the
auxilliary£,;,_dfvision, which made me president "of the
Sheriff’ s "Arssbciation. ’ ’ n »

' “I was in there for four years -- badge, uniform and‘
everything . E . but the gun,” he says. “Anyone would like
;,to have the ID card, the shield.” ’
His rank was handy once at“, of all places, the White Tower

at North Craig Street. ‘ ‘I ordered some eggs over light there
one night, ’ ’ he recalls, ‘ ‘and the waitress brought them back
to me almost raw. I told her I wanted them over easy, and

she told me ifl continued to give her a hard time she’d have

me arrested.

“I didn’t want to cause trouble, but I did want my eggs
cooked. so ‘she talked to a policeman at the other end of the
counter and told him I was a troublemaker. He looked over

It’s not a college bar -- in fact, it’s_ a -
’ restaurant -- but students are not strangers to Gustine’s. .

 

city’s emergency system will
not take into account the
location of campus phones.
The two emergency systems
will not be related, and Hayllar
said he feels non-college
residents of Oakland will" feel
more secure with phones for
their own use.
_ The campus phones have
been useful to members of the
Oakland community, according
to Waters.

“About 5 percent of our calls
have been for real emergency

purposes,” Waters said.

_ “This includes medical prob-

lems and_ street:-type confron-
tations, such as assault. We've
also had general traffic ‘acci-
dents reported by phone.”
Waters said the most impor-
tant calls made on the phone

system were made bydormi-‘

tory students to report the
explosion at Langley Hall in
January of 1976. Calls have
also been made from the
emergency phone on the fourth
ﬂoor of the Hillman Library to
report incidents ranging from
purse snatchingsv to cases of
indecentexposure. I

When asked his feeling

when the emergency system
was set up at Pitt, but they
have declined signiﬁcantly.

“We’re down to about ﬁve‘ '

crank calls a month now,” said
Waters‘, “and the novelty of
vandalism has worn off——only
a few phones in isolated areas
ever get vandalized.”

concerning the importance of
the emergency phone boxes,

Waters_said that “if students-

don’t have access to. the
phones, they don’t have access
to us.” ,

Perhaps the city of Pitts-
burgh wants to give all
residents the same access.

myself. He looked at the woman ‘Miss’ he said, “I think
you’d better cook the gentleman’s eggs.’,’ . —

‘But with students, and especially Greeks, Oehling is just
one of the guys 4- most of the time. “Not when the kids
were streaking,” he says. V '

couldn’t see.‘ Ran right into the arms of a campus cop; It

might-have‘béen‘tne'funniest thing I've everseen at Pitt. .

“The poor kid almost got thrown out of school,” Oehling
adds, “but today he has a Ph.D. and is very successful in

business. ’ ’ . -

“A week later, these kids were interviewed on the Marie
Torre Show,” he continues, “and one of them streaked
across the studio in front ‘of the cameras.’ I guess,” Oehling
concludes “kids never change.”

“Freshman are still freshman, and seniors are still
seniors,” he ‘says. “The individual kids grow up, but the
overall picture remains the same.” _ '

Oehling’s most recent role found him behind a bench in

the Law Bui1ding’s moot courtroom. Bill O’Donnell, a‘
fraternity brother of Oehling’s, was ﬁlming a courtroom

sequence for a class. The titleof the ﬁlmwas “Who’s
Pointing the Finger, ” so William H. Oehling (or W.H.0. , as

-his monogrammed work shirts read)’ seemed a natural

lead. An acquaintance -- and in a pinch, he seems to have a
million of them ‘-- opened the courtroom and the sequence

in  was ﬁlmed.

this man whose current occupation causes him to be part

By the Associated Press

WASHINGTON—Earl Ruby tes-
tiﬁed Tuesday that his'brother Jack
insisted to his death that he acted
on an impulse and without help

' when he barged through Dallas

police lines and murdered Lee
Harvey Oswald.

Ruby told the House assassina-
tions committee that he asked his
brother why ‘he shot Oswald, the

accused assassin of President John '

F. Kennedy, and that Jack ‘Ruby
told him:
“When I saw him come through

‘ there with that smirk on his face as

though he were happy he killed the
president, I _ just lost control of

Ruby also testified that his
brother maintained he had never
known Oswald before he shot him.

Jack Ruby was convicted by a‘

Texas state court of murdering
He was sentenced to
death. -But the conviction was-
overtumed by the Texas Supreme
Court and Ruby was awaiting a new
trial when he died of cancer on Jan.

Ruby said his brother insisted to
his death that he alone was
responsible for Oswald"s murder—
an event witnessed on television by

millions of horror-stricken Ameri-
can two days after Kennedy’s
assassination.

The testimony came as the
committee considered various
theories that critics of the Warren
Commission have espoused in
efforts to discredit the commissions
conclusions that Oswald acted
alone in killing Kennedy and that

Ruby acted alone in killing Oswald. '

Ruby, 3. Dallas nightclub opera-
tor, was eulogized by Rabbi David
Graubert as “a misguided
patriot.” 4

“On the surface Ruby was an
avenger,” Rabbi Graubert said at
Ruby’s funeral’. in his native
Chicago. “He was an avenger of
blood who pursued‘ the manslayer
while the blood was hot. He was a
misguided avenger—a misguided
patriot.” . ‘

One conspiracy buff, however,
has contended that the Warren
Commission ignored evidence that
Ruby agreed in 1959 to be an
informant for the FBI.

Author Mark Lane, an attorney-
who presently represents James
Earl Ray, the confessed killer of Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr., has said
that the commission learned of
Ruby’s possible connection with

the late FBI Director -J. Edgar
Hoover.

Lane said the commission failed
to mention that letter in either its
report or 26 volumes of evidence.
The latter said, in part, that Ruby
was contacted on March 11, 1959,
by an FBI agent in Dallas “in ‘view
of his position as a nightclub
operator who might have know-

reportedly because it had obtained
a temporary court injunction
banning such activity last week.

‘Conrail, which is’ concentrated in

country appeared to be in Chicago,

Commuters Voice Views Over Sch

By SUE McFARLAND

Pitt News Staff Writer

Although many Pitt commuters
favor a recent proposal to rennovate

Schenley Hall, there are a variety of

different views on how the project
should be funded.

“There is a deﬁnite need for
rennovations in the Student
Union,” said Dawn, Gideon, a
commuter for three years. “But the
rennovations should not just be for

the commuters but fol’ 311
students.”
Gideon cited the need for

improved lounge and recreation
areas and allotment of more space
in the lobby areas, which tend to
become crowded during peak
hours.

Gideon said that any rennova-
tions performed in the Student
Union would be aimed not only at
better serving the students but also
at the people who‘work there. For
this reason she believes that a fee
should also be assessed ‘every
person working in the Schenley
facility.

‘‘I suppose some students who
live on campus and don’t use the
Student Union alot mightask why
they should have to pay a fee, “Lori
Balog,
student said, “But on the other
hand, look at commuters who are-
forced to pay a student health fee
when most commuters have their
own doctors at home.“

The proposal -to rennovate
Schenley Hall, which was initially
introduced this past summer, was

Towers lobby   n

a sophomore nursing A

just recently given the go-ahead by
Chancellor Posvar. At the present

' time administrators, architects and

a University consultant are at work
on designs and funding schemes for
the project. At this point
administrators believe the funding
will come entirely from a Student
Union rennovation fee to“ ' be
assessed every student on a per
term basis. A

According to Willard “Bud ”
Heaps, director of student activi-
ties, his office in conjunction with
other divisions of student affairs
will, in the next several weeks, be
interested in soliciting the input of
all students on the subject of the
renovation of Schenley Hall.

“Our ultimate goal in the project
is to have the most unique student
union in the United States in
terms of responding to the needs of
students,” Heaps said.

Sophomore Karen Erny said,
there is a definite lack of space in
the present facility. She added that
such areas as the lower lounge and

television rooms are not adequate to —

accomodate comfortably the num-
ber of students passing through
them each day. , ~

“What we have here is the
problem of providing a place that is
more conducive to the needs of
students’,’said_ Senior Harvey Block,
“also by renovating the Student
Union the chances of bringing new
students to the campus would be
increased. ’ ’ _

Willie Tolbert, a senior political
science major believed that the

I Senatorial
  Scholarships

  » Come to an End

l,hUnde.r pressure from the Pittsburgh and

» Philadelphia news media, the State Senate voted 31- ‘

17 Monday to terminate its senatorial scholarship

T, program, effective next September. ,'Despite the

disappointment and possible hardship this'will bring
tq some students here, the decision to cutoff the of-

"ten-abused scholarship fund is in the best interests of

the Commonwealth. The decision also provides the

if ‘Legislature with the opportunity to aid, in a more

equitable fashionjstudents here and at other state-
related universities. ' -
 Under the senatorial scholarship program, all 50

senators, the governor and the lieutenant governor

’ each can award six four-year or 24 one-year scholar-
" ships to Pitt, Penn State, Temple and the University

of Pennsylvania. Any number of scholarships could .

be awarded to students attending Lincoln University.
The average grant came to about $600 annually, and
the total cost of the program was $3.1’ million a year.

Each school receivedits share of this sum in its an-

nual state appropriation.

The scholarship program came under attack’ " in
recent months as some sources in the news media,
notably the Philadelphia Inquirer, began to allege
that ‘certain senators had used the ‘fund to gain
political leverage and repay political debts. The
Inquirer revealed that scholarships had been given to
relatives of various legislators and to the sons and
daughters of wealthy, inﬂuential citizens who had no

- real financial need for them. The exact number of

scholarships that fall into this category has been dif-
ficult to determine, though, because both the univer-
sities and the senators involved have often refused to
identify individual grant recipients. They have
claimed that‘ the Buckley Amendment, a federal
student-privacy law, prevents them from releasing
the names. '

What all this boils down to is ‘that for theumpteen-
th time in recent years, an institution of Pennsylvania
government has had its image tarnished by the ac-

-_tions of a few‘of its members. The result has been the
reinforcement _of a widespread conviction that this
state’s politicians cannot be trusted with the public
monies. ' ; ,

This might be reason enough to ‘terminate the
senatorial scholarship program, but Senate Minority
Leader Henry Hager’s reasons are better. Noting
that senators are not trained as ‘financial aid officers
and that they are unqualified to determine a student’s
need for a scholarship, Hager was a leader of the

fight to end the 97-year old semi-disguised senatorial
perquisite. T
Separating the senators from the scholarships does

not mean that the $3.1 million should be taken away -

from the universities, however. The funds previously
earmarked for students designated by the lawmakers
should be e/quitably distributed among the state-
related schools and included in those universities’
general appropriations. These “freed-up” dollars

could then be . used in the universities’ general‘

scholarship programs as needed, "with awards made
on the basis of need and merit, rather than politics
and favoritism. \ ’ »

Finally, students who now receive the senatorial
scholarships and genuinely‘ ‘need them should. be
given every opportunity to establish their claims to
continuing financial aid. To deprive any deserving
student of the opportunity for. an education would
only aggravate an already unpleasant situation. '

was emphasized and the virtues of
the atom were earnestly extolled.

become imperative to construct as
many nuclear power plants by the
year 2000 as possible. The
assumptions upon which this
urgency is based are seemingly so
reasonable that no other course of
action is possible or even desirable.

But upon reading the Time essay
some questions come to mind.’
There is a weighty appeal to
science to justify nuclear energy-
i.e., let the facts speak. for
themselves. Protesters against

«~ nuclear energy are viliﬁed not only
as unreasonable and obstructionist,
but unscientiﬁc. But the science
appealed to is markedly absent
beyond the name in pro-nuclear
arguments. It ‘consists largely of
statements such as “scientists
predict" or “scientists offer an

opinion.” A Although'these may be
statements by trained people, it is

.doubtful that opinions and predic-

tions will help much in a meltdown.
Despite claims of the reasonable-
ness of nuclear energy, solid
answers are no forthcoming. A ‘

believe, based on short-term
performance, that nuclear power is
safe, but such faith does not offer
much comfort to those who are less

certain of the merits of nuclear-

energy. ~

are played upon—what if we freeze
in the dark? A fuel shortage such’
as the one two winters ago adds to
the pressure of our fear.
But what are the real reasons for.
_such shortages? "After the,en,ergy
crisis of 1973 it was revealed that
shortages were not the result of
lack of supply, but greed. The oil
companies withheld supplies to
force prices up. Recent shortages

have been the result of transport I

problems as well as increased
demand.
It is not sensible to minimize the

seriousness of our energy prob-

lems, but neither is it sensible to,

rush ‘ahead with nuclear develop-
ment based on ourfears. The

subtle panic that urges haste and L

mocks stubborn opposition is the
very antithesis of thereasonable-A
ness the Time essay appeals to.

Under the surface things are not as ’

clearcut and scientific as nuclear
proponents might have us think. ,
The problem of our future energy
needs is indeed urgent—4\7ve cannot
.fail to take it seriously. But to
claim that there is no time to review

' alternative energy sources is highly ’

irresponsible: ,.
The most revealing manipulation
of opinion in the Time essay is
demonstrated in a classic debater’s
trick. The essay questions the
no-growth and slow-growth‘ men-
tality of some anti-nuclear groups.
=It suggests that any slowing of
economic growth, the heart of our
American economy, could topple
our way of life, our democracy.
Such rhetoric is designed in the
best melodramatic tradition to
strike fear in our hearts. Like a
logical syllogism the thoughts
follow: if one opposes nuclear
energy one is opposed to growth,
which in turn means that one is
opposed to upward mobility,.and
thus one is opposed to democracy.
Being pro-nuclear energy is tanta-
mount to being an American. In
addition, the accusation is made

M that if growth is opposed ,one has-

’-~c

consigned the poor and joblessptod

their fate. In some impossible way"

the equation is made that nuclear

energy is salvation for the poor.
Such mental gymnastics miss the

point. ‘Those-who question nuclear

energy are not an elite group who .

wish to keep the poor in theirplace.

They emphasize that important X

questions should be asked before
we commit ourselves to nuclear
power. Should we assume that the
acquisition of more inaterial goods
is necessary to human life? Wealth
for the middle class, ,by allowing

growth, ‘does not always bring-

wealth to the poor; the money does
not filter down. There has been
prosperity in the past that did not
touch those in need. '

Nuclear energy, contrary to the
Time essay, will not solve our
energy problems or increase
economic growth enough to’ elim-

inate poverty. "What anti-nuclear

groups are pointing out is that we
cannot go_on the way we have been
going. Our economic upward
mobility with its energy-wasting

(3.

development has helped us into the -

energy crisis.

I A conservation of the resources
we have would be one way to
combat shortages. Instead of
expecting wealth to filter down we
all «should consider cutting out
waste and beginning to share what
we do have. The resources of the"
earth are ﬁnite; is it right to
perpetuate growth as if they were
not?

The Time essay reveals the
confused state of our thinking—no
one is certain about what we need
to do. But given the dangers of
nuclear energy, reduced thought
theyimay be, it behooves all of us to
be certain that this is’ the way we
should go. To rush panicking into a
solution does not bode well for
long-term solutions, but only gives

Hazelwood-Oakland Bus
Route in Service
A new Port Authority bus route now exists between

H Oakland and Hazelwood. The route, S6U, runs directly to

Hazelwood, eliminating the previous one-hour trip that ran
via downtown. The route, which takes ten minutes, is the
result of extensive lobbying by Chuck O’Neil. a VISTA
worker associated with the ‘Pittsburgh Neighborhood
Alliance Task Force.

The new bus route may open up a wide vareity of
Off-Campus Housing opportunities to Pitt students, said
O’Neil. But although the new bus route makes Hazelwood
much more accessible, certain problems in that community
must be solved before any significant number of Pitt
students will be able to set up residence.’

SGB Plans Campus Survey

A campus bus survey to determine ways of expanding
and improving the current route is set to be conducted by
the Student Government Board and the University’s
Parking Ofﬁce, according to SGB president Josh Baylson.

“There have been a lot of complaints about the bus
system,” Baylson said.
campus bus service has been effective.”

Baylson plans to interview some 500 students randomly
in the Cathedral, Student Union and the Towers lobby. He
said plans will also be made to inform department
chairmen to distribute the survey to 250 faculty members
and 250 staff personnel. ’ ‘

Committee Moves to Kill Pay Raises

But supporters feel the bill may have been fatally
amended. _ T

By an 11-5 vote, the committee adopted an amendment by
Sen. Thomas Nolan, D-Allegheny, that would permit one
house to adopt a pay raise report even if the other house

refuses to do so.

“Why should one House be permitted to kill it for the

  Restaurants: the French And Indian Fares

  (La Fondue

By MAGGIE MCKAY

La Fondue, Pittsburgh's first and
only fondue restaurant, is notable for
its good food, pleasant atmosphere
and friendly waiters. Set in an aban-
doned’Greek Orthodox church on the
corner of Bates and Atwood Street,

., ~ La Fondue capitalizes on the charm

Q.

of the ecclesiastical setting.

The high vaulted ceiling, the red
carpet and the beautiful stained glass
windows fill the dining room with

- color and light. The choir loft above
’has been turned into a cozy bar

overlooking the altar which now
sports wine racks and a bright blue
banner embroidered La Fondue. An
added attraction is the absence of
musak—classical_ music provides ex-
cellent background sounds.

The menu consists of a variety. of
fondues and a few dishes cooked at
tableside by the waiters. There are
also fondue appetizers, including a
basic cheese fondue served with
sourdough bread ($3.50), a ham and
cheese fondue ($4.25) and a com-
bination of ham, olives, sausages and
cheese ($4.25).

Prices, though moderate ‘for the
working set, ‘are a bit expensive for
the average college student. (A
modest ‘meal, without drinks, runs
about $25 for two.)

All fondues are cooked by the
customers and a fondue burner
graces the center of each table.
The menu gives explicit instructions
on how long to cook each item.

A half-pound filet of beef fondue is
$9.25, with a pound of filet weighing
in at $12.75. The prime chunks of
filet are served with Brussel sprouts,
raw zucchini slices and mushrooms.

The meatball and cheese fondue
($6.75) is also served with an as-
sortment of vegetables. Fondue
ltaliano, meatballs with hot tomato

' sauce, also costs $6.75. Shrimp,

scallops or a combined seafood fon-
due range from $7.50 to $8.75. All
the above are accompanied by sour-
dough bread. Most of these dishes
are meant for one person.

The tableside dishes, which serve
two, include Fettucini Hilary—a basic’

fettucini Alfredo, simmered in oil and '

buttered sherry and fresh
mushrooms ($18.95). Our party of
four opted for the veal marsala and
shrimp and scallops ($18.95 and
$17.95 respectively). Each dish
was served with green spinach
noodles—lightly buttered and
seasoned. Both were well-cooked
and deftly sewed by the waiters. (No

waitresses in this establishment.)

All entrees are served with a
vegetable, bread andsalad. The lat-
ter, a tossed salad ‘with fresh lettuce,
raw vegetables and a house
dressing, is topped with crumbled
blue cheese.

Desserts are a definite dieter's
delight—highly calorie and wonder-
fully rich. chunks of angel food cake
($1.95) and an array of fresh fruit

French wines can be had for $7 and
$10. if a ‘rich relative accompanies
you to La Fondue, you can splurge
and get a bottle of Mouton Rothschild
for $150 or a Chateau Margaux for
$45. '

when visiting La Fondue, allow at
least two-and-a-half hours for dining.
Its pleasant atmosphere makes the
time fly-. Though reservations are
required, we did not find the
restaurant crowded. the service was

($1.95) are served with a pot of hot,

, creamy semi-sweet chocolate. Can-

taloupe, melons and bananas
covered with chocolate are definitely
interesting. The taste of the fruit is a
delicate contrast to the chocolate.

Dr. John's special is especially
good—chunks of caramel dipped in
chocolate. (One word of caution: the
caramels are covered with
cellophane. An unwary member of
our party discovered that fact too
late.)

The coffee is expensive at 85
cents a cup. Brands of coffee range
from mocha to kona. The tea
drinkers in our party chose from a
variety of imported teas ‘including
English breakfast, orange spice,
pepperment and Russian caravan (50
cents).

Though we did not opt for wine
with our meal (being on a limited

budget), the wine list is extensive, in- .

cluding some notable California
wines. Domestic, German and

excellent. The waiters were amiable
and helpful. All in all, a good place to

Taj

By ANGELE ELUS

Oakland's Taj is not a-palace, but a
quiet, six-table eatery tucked into a
storefront at 1 17 Oakland Ave. Were
it not for a few Indian tapestlies and
beaded straw light fixtures 
expect to be served apple pie and
coffee.

The menu next to the counter-.
however, contains a variety: of exotic
yet reasonably priced dishes. One
can order a full Indian mea'l—ap-
petizer, entree, bread, beverage,and
dessert—for about $4.

Our party of three began with
samosa, a tart stuffed with a mildly
spicy mixture of potatoes‘ and peas
and pakora, two crunchy chick pea
and vegetable fritters. Each is 50
cents, and helps to prepare an
American palate for the curry_-laden
entrees.

Lamb curry ($3.25), beef 

($2.25) and chicken curry ($2.25):

are cooked and curried in‘ their ‘own

juices. So is keema ($2.25),»a'c'om- ~
bination of ground beef and peas. All _

entrees are served with generous

helpings of seasoned rice and 5-
cooked vegetables, mostly potatoes 7

and peas.

The chicken curry we sampled’:

was tasty and tender, but proved hot
when eaten with the rice and

vegetables. The keema sampled also ~

was good, but very spicv.

Diners with vegetarian appetites 3

can choose from a selection of en-

trees priced at $1.95: egg, kofta

(cabbage balls), chana paneer (chick

peas and cheese), dal sag (lentils and

spinach) and matar aloo (green peas

and potatoes). The egg dish ‘we
sampled was, like the_meat entrees,

heavily curried.

Paratha (50 cents), a flat, whole
wheat bread, proved a neutralizing in-
fluence on the meal. One also can
order kukla, a bread made from white

» flour. Beverages include a variety of

soft drinks (35 cents), Indian tea (35
cents) and a yogurt milkshake (75
cents). Our party found the soft
drinks to be a cooling a familiar touch.

Dessert at Taj is a
sweetened end to dinner.
pied gulab jamun (50 cents), a
spongy cheese ball in syrup, and bur-
fi (50 cents), a white, milky fudge. A
rice pudding, phirni (50 cents), also is -‘
available.

The Dormchoir Athlete and Leisure Sports

Leisure time has become a serious business in America. Leisure no
longer means "killing time.” American s bring intensity, commitment and
zeal to the pursuit of the new pleasure principle sweeping the nation.

Dr. Alexander Reed Matln, former head of the American Psychiatric
Association has said, “Our culture puts great emphasis ‘on productivity.
We feel we must always be doing something with our time. We see a child
swinging on a gate and we say ‘Go and find something to do.’
We fail to realize that he's already doing something—he's swinging on a
gate. inevitably, when we grow up, instead of swinging on gates when we
feel like it, - we go out and ‘find something to do."’

Life magazine featured an almost prophetic essay in September, 19 71
about America and its growing preoccupation with leisure sports activity.
The editors wrote, “... The weekend is a state of mind...we talk fishing at
the factory, surfing at the store, skiing in the office.'’ ‘ ‘

increasingly when one asks people, “What do you do?" instead of

‘ hearing ‘‘I'm a chemical engineer, " or I'm an accountant,” one hears ‘‘I’m in-

to jogging, " and “I play basketball. "

enough to watch football on television or to engage in a leisurely game of
golf to consider oneself a sportsman or woman. The leisure sports such as
jogging, tennis, basketball, recreational football, and even frisbee are now a
means to any end—physical fitness and emotional health._

In tune-with the American work ethic, the Americanpleasure principle
now has a purpose. No longer does the average sports enthusiast have to

become defensive about the time and money he puts into his favorite sport.
It's not‘ just a waste of resources, he claims triumphantly, it's adding years
to his life. ‘

And so the new-breed of athletes get up at 6:30 a.m.,_ lace up their new
Adidas sneakers and jog fivemiles before going to class. On weekends
they go backpacking. In between these activities, they take disco lessons,
play co-recreational volleyball anddo isometrics while studying.

Those of us, more sedentary in nature, slowly are becoming sucked up
by the new leasure principle. Riddled with guilt over our slothflness, we sign
up for a one credit gym course in fencing or swimming. -Then, perhaps, it's
just one leisure learning course in yoga. Before we know it, we're jogging

There is a new active identification with the leisure sports. It is no longer

The fitness-minded Pitt student
can. choose University-sponsored
sports ranging from tennis to disco
dancing. The intramural program, the

' Leisure Learning Program and the

athletic program are the main options
available at Pitt. I

Disco dancing and slimnastics
exist side-by-side with non-athletic
pursuits such as wine-tasting in Pitt's
Leisure Learning Program, founded in
1975 to “provide co-curricular and
developmental experiences for Pitt
students" as well as faculty and staff.

Leisure Learning classes run 10
weeks during fall and winter sessions
and seven weeks during spring
session. The weekly courses are
available to anyone with a current Pitt
ID, and range in price from $13 to
$30. Beginning courses are usually
cheaper. Athletic pursuits offered in-
clude basic disco dancing, advanced
disco, jazz, ballet, modern dance,

yoga, slimnastics and tai chi chuan.

“People want to be able to do the
things they see people doing at the
VIP or other clubs they go to," said
Howard Zeigler, who teaches advan-
ced disco. ‘‘I feel that students derive
confidence and the means to
socialize, as well as exercise, from
the class."

Zeigler said many students enjoy
his disco class so-much that they
repeat it. Attendence has grown from
26 to 63 in two years.

‘Kathy Lindsly, elimnastics teacher,
said that the students in her class
“have different ideas of what they
want to do. Some are using sports as
a way to exercise; others like. to
exercise less competitively.
Secretaries, students, middle-aged
women and joggers who are already
in shape take this course. I en-
courage students to exercise beyond
the class, and work out fitness
programs that they can use all week.

“People enjoy the group at-
mosphere, and the support everyone

’ gives each other by cheering each

other on,” Linds|y_continued.

Leisure Learning students have
positive reactions to the program.

‘'I have more fun now when I go
out to clubs because I don't have to
stand around watching other people
dance,” said Bob Holton, a CAS

people, and didn't feel stupid or em-
barassed while I was learning.
Everyone was there to learn.”

“I liked my Leisure Learning
classes because I learned everything
the courses advertised they were
going to include,” said Kathy Mayer,
a CAS senior who has taken several

Leisure Learning classes, including
dance. ‘‘It’s easier to learn in classes

like this because you're taking
something you're really interested
in."
If you need extra motivation to
exercise, Pitt's basic physical
education classes will award" one
credit in exchangetor bodily effort.
Physical education courses are of-
fered during fall, winter and summer
terms, and usually are conducted
twice or three times a week in Trees
Hall. Course selection ranges from
popular sports such as tennis and
racquetball to esoteric ones such as
karate and rock climbing.
Full-time students can fit a gym
class into their schedules at no extra
cost. Equipment for some courses,

in the morning and playing intramural basketball at night.

such as tennis, must be purchased
by the student; in other courses,
such as fencing, equipment is
provided. A $16 locker fee is
required; gym clothes and-towels are
provided along with the locker.

Carl Rees, who teaches tennis I,
said most students in his class “have
tried the game once or twice, but
were frustrated and sought instruc-
tion."

Tennis I has a social rather than a
competitive atmosphere, Rees said,
because the emphasis is on skill tests
and working with serving machines
rather than winning actual games.

‘‘I will probably call on my
classmates for tennis partners in the
future," said a student currently

enrolled in tennis I. ‘‘I took the
course to stay active during the win-
ter. I also needed an extra credit to

graduate."
Other students had mixed reac-

tions to physical education courses.
“Karate was great—a fantastic
workout,” said a student who took
the course last year. “But it was time-
consuming; I spent four hours a week

./7‘./'/"./.‘/'./.'/'./.‘/‘./‘/JA‘./’./7' J‘ ./.7‘-/~'//-'/'

working for just one credit.”
A student who took the personal

fitness course feels differently.

“Even though I felt I could have
done the exercises alone,” she said.
"the encouragement of my teacher
and classmates pushed me to draw
upon all my resources."

“Activity for everyone” is the mot-
to of Pitt's intramural program. With
10,000 participants in divisions such
as Fraternity, Dormitory and

Graduate-Faculty, the program is
larger than ,Pitt’s athletic
program—and all for fun.-

The intramural program, spon-_
sored by Pitt's athletic department, IS

open to Pitt students, faculty and-

staff. Teams are organized within
seven divisions: Engineering,
Women's, Co-Flec., Independent,

TGraduate-Faculty, Dormitory and

Fraternity. Except for a $5 forfeit fee
posted with the Intramural _Office by

each team, participation is free.
Sports clubs, largely self-financed,
exit for those interested in sprots
such as judo and riflery. .
Recreation football and recreation
basketball are the latest additions to
the intramural program, which in-
cludes almost any sport one could
name. Both games, developed by
assistant intramural director Lou
Fabian and student Kathy Evans,
emphasize cooperation over com-
petition. Blocking is outlawed‘ in

recreation football; fouling out is for- _

bidden in recreation basketball.
“Winning" in both sports is a dual
team effort—the total scores of op-
_posing teams are compared against
the joint scores of other teams com-
peting at the same time.

Recreation basketball, in which 12
percent of the intramural basketball

teams participated last year, “allows .

for more participation, provides more
physical exercise, fosters develop-
ment of social interaction, and
provides an environment where
ability is not the prime factor in who
does or does not play,’' according to
Fabian and Evans.

This is the first year for recreation
football. .

“lntramurals are a lot of fun," said
a student who participated last year.

“People sometimes get competitive,

but they don't kill themselves.”

  Rules and Regulations

RACQUET BALL

Tennis has long been a popular game among college I students.
However, there are racquet games similar to tennis which "are gaining in

popularity, most notably raCClUetb3"-

Some devotees claim racquetball is easier to learn and is less in- -
timidating than is tennis. The racquet, which looks like a scaled-down tennis
racquet, is easier to control and one has more leeway for error. Shots that

would be errors in tennis rebound off the walls of the racquetball court and
keep the rally going. 1 V

Racquetball is a challenging, fast moving game that combines some of -

the best features of tennis, handball, squash and badminton.
Racquetball has been rated among the four lifetime sports in promoting.
physical fitness—the others being bicycling, swimming and handball.

RULES AND PROCEDURES:

Racquetball is played on an enclosed court, 20 feet wide, 40 feet long
and 20 feet high; Play begins with one person standing in the service zone,
usually near mid-court. His opponent must stand five feet behind the back

service line or “short line."

The server is allowed two serves. He must hit the ball directly to
the front wall. If the ball strikes a side wall, floor or ceiling before hitting the
front wall, the server loses a serve.

,' All other errors on the first serve result in a fault and the server receives
a final attempt as in tennis. '

If the ball strikes the front wall properly, it must rebound beyond the
short line to be in play. But, the ball must not hit the back wall in the air
before touching the floor. '

The receiver cannot hit the ball until it passes the short line and then he
must hit it before it bounces twice on the floor. He can use any combination
of walls to return the ball to the front wall, providing the ball doesn't first hit
the floor (a “skip”). '

If the ball strikesthe front wall properly, the rally continuestuntil one ‘

player fails to return the ball before it bounces twice or the shot “skips”
before reaching the front wall. ‘ _
Points are scored only to the serving player when the server wins the

rally or scores an “ace” (receiver fails to return serve to front wall before
ball bounces twice).

The first player to reach 21 points wins the game. Matches are generally.
two out of three games. - .'

A Label That Won’t Stick—'——the ’Women’s Film’

By Martha H. Garvey

Contrary to about a million inches
of print, women's films we
nonexistent. /

And even if they did exist, they
shouldn't.

But this is the lastessay you'll ever
have to read about them.

For the purposes of this
essay-—and for those of you who
don't read People, Time or
Newsweek, “women’s films" are the
biggest trend in movies since
remakes. Depending on-whose list
vou read, they include anv or all of
the following: Annie Hall, Julia, The
Turning Point, An Unmarried Woman
and Coming Home. What

they all have in common—as far as I
can»tell—is they all contain, as a cen-
tral character, a woman who is left
alive at the end~of the~movie_:~ -She is
white, middle class, heterosexual and
between the ages of 25 and 40.
There is usually an attractive but
neurotic man lurking somewhere.
They get involved. He usually
sticks around for at least half of th
movie. '
l have just performed an
outrageous bit of over-simplification

. on a group of very good films. But it's

no more outrageous than what
several hundred other critics have
done to these films. "Women's film”
is a label made of Silly Putty, and it's
about time someone pulled on it until
it snapped.

All the films I've mentioned have"

another thing in common. They were
written, directed, produced, and

funded by men. So what does a film
have to do in order to win a "women's
film" label? Not very much, apparen-
ently. It certainly doesn't have

anything to do with economic con-
trol-—never ‘mind artistic control. My
guess is that if there is a woman
somewhere on screen at least 51
percent of the time, the movie has
qualified for the honor.

Like most labels, “women's film" is
momentarily comforting and
ultimately useless. It may also
damage, soothing where it hoped to
incite. Imagine: a young filmmaker
makes the hottest film since “Star

Wars." She rushes to a studio and
kneels down in. her Frye boots to
beg for distribution. The movie
executive looks at her, looks at the
film, looks at her, looks at his list, and
sends her away. “Sorry," he says,
"we already did our women's film this
yeah

“Women’s films” are not the same
thing as a woman's film. Meaning:
We've had a lot of boffo smash hits
about women by men this year. We
have yet to see a boffo smash hit by a
woman about anything —caterpillars,

houseplants, gearshifts. While Paul
Mazursky was filming An Unmarried
Woman on the streets of Soho in
New York, Claudia Weill was walking
those same streets trying to find
backers for her film Girlfriends.

4 Girlfriends took three years to
finish—not exactly record Hollywood
time. Weill didn't have a tem-
peramental star or a cinematographer
who didn't speak English. She did
have an Academy Aard nomination
for Best Documentary. But she didn't
have the money. Girlfriends almost
didn't make it to compete for the
lucky label.

Girlfriends may not be Star
Wars, but it is good. Weill may have
just been lucky enough to find a
distributor who hadn't done “our
women's film this year.”

An Unmarried Woman is another
pig in a poke. Okay, sure, she
laughs, she cries, she feels angry,
she feels lonely, she feels guilty, she
makes breakfast, she makes love,
she makes do, she is strong. ‘Pretty
good for a Vassar graduate. In the
same" ad from which I quote this
superhuman list of characteristics (all
this and a penthouse apartment too),
is another more important title. The
full title of the film isn'tAn Unmarried
Woman. It's Paul Mazursky’s An
Unmarried Woman.‘ Nice going,
Paul. I'm sure you can make break-
fast and make love as well asAn Un-
married Woman. But it's not your
movie.

 

No one—no person, no man, no
woman-makes a" commercial film by
him or herself. There's no such thing
as a Stevie Wonder of the commer-
cial film industry. Joe Brooks may try
by writing, directing, producing and
acting in his film and writing the title
song. But I feel sure he didn't get up
at dawn to style Shelly Hack’s hair in
‘‘If Ever l_See You‘ Again." Film at

some point, becomes a collective ef-
fort.’ Alan Ladd of Twentieth-Century
Fox let Paul Mazursky call his movie
Paul Mazursky’s An Unmarried
Woman. That's because Alan Ladd
is president of the company that paid
for ‘‘Paul Mazursky’s movie.”

F1-‘

One of the redeeming features of
these “women's films” has been
collectivity. As far as I'm concerned,
the earth has only moved slightly.‘
We're still seeing what we've been
seeing since film began—which is an
overwhelmingly male point of view.
That men have chosen to make

“their” films aboutian awful lot of
women lately is very touching. But
wrongheaded and silly films are still
wrongheaded and silly films, whether
they're about attractive middle-class
white women or about frozen ar-
tichokes. What redeems every single
one of these “women’s films" is each
contains a remarkably good perfor-
mance by an actress.

Shirley MacLaine’s whole body
seems to strain against the incredible
frump dresses she wears in “The
Turning Point."
Sally Hyde is a woman whose
sexuality—-as well as most of her
spirit and persona|ity—have been
hairsprayed to death. Jane Fonda’s

' Sally Hyde is a bright, funny, sexy

woman. Again, Fonda’s Lillian
Hellman has more guts in her painted
fingernails than the rest of the film put
together. And while the ads make

unmarried woman Erica Martin sound -

like a grown-up Betsy Wetsy. doll, Jill
Clayburgh’s Erica is one tough but
vulnerable cookie.

These performances may account
for the sense of strain i find in
'“women's films.” It is impossible for.
any actor to ovenivhelm a filmmaker's
intention. if the‘ actor tries, his or her
performance usually ends up on the
cutting room floor. It is possible for a
performance to undercut the film.
Nhen An Unmarried Woman
becomes stickily romantic, when
tough Erica suddenly has nothing
better to do with her time than watch
her boyfriend slop paint in his studio
and ignore her, then I stop believing.
Clayburgh’s performance has been
just a little too strong for me to
believe her instant Suzy Homemaker
imitation. What's more, I got the
feeling that Clayburgh didn't believe
it. either.

So what's the alternative? Women
of the arts unite? Give us bread and

roses and 35 millimeter film?

Yes and no. I don't have any con-
fidence that if all the women film-
makers in the world took over the
studios tomorrow our films would be

any better. They would, lam sure, be 8

different from male-dominated

women's films. I think a’ woman is just
as capable of making a stupid sexist
film as is a man. While men and
women may grow up with different
priorities—Erica makes eggs while
her boyfriend creates with a capital

C--they don’t grow up in completely -

separate societies.

‘ Women don't just have to be given
cameras and money and John
Williams soundtracks. They don't
have to be given anything at all, ex-
cept the right to fail, -and fall again,
and fall again. The pressure on
women to succeed is so intense I can
imagine a young filmmaker lying
awake, staring at her ceiling, mum-
bling, “But what if it isn't ‘Citizen
Kane’?" The law of averages says
that for everystar Wars, there will be
17 Last Remakes of Beau Geste.
For everyJaws there will be 64 Other

SIDE of Midnight.

The law of averages must now allow
that some of these turkeys will be
made by women. -

To succeed, a film made by a
woman is going to have to, do the
same -thing a film made by a man
does: make money. (if you were
hoping for some transcendentaltruth,
you'll have to wait for my film.) This is

“Coming Home's” _

another area in which the label
“women’s film" does not represent
truth in packaging. I can't think of any
successful commercial filmmaker
who wrote at the top of his “To Do"

list, “Make films that only women will
go to see." While I don't deny any
filmmaker's personal vision, I hazard a
guess that somewhere in the back of
most filmmaker's minds is a large
billboard. It says: ‘‘I want everyone
in the world to see my film.”

All these films about women made
by men are intended in some way to
appeal to a lot of people. Even Jane
Fonda, old Hanoi Hannah herself,
said that if these films don’t draw
people and megabucks, critics are
going to have to find themselves a
new trend."

A film that tells the truth about a
woman's life must touch men and
women. I didn't say touch in exactly
the same wav. It may irritate one
man, delight one woman, and in-
furiate everyone else. I reject most of
the women's films not because they
were made by men, but because they
seem-inacurate, untruthful, new ver-
sions of old illusions. I'm not sure
why that is—all these films were
made by competent, sensitive film-
makers. I do, of course, have a
theory. “

Art demands ego.
ticularly expensive art, like a com-

mercial film—demands an almost:

maniacal belief in one’s own talent
and ability to communicate. Until very
recently, maniacal belief in one’s own
talent has been a masculine province.

Until this generation, it was not par-
ticularly O.K. for a girl to dream of
becoming the next Orson Welles or

Francois Truffaut or
Spielberg- So those little boys who
grew up to be Orson Jr. and the

second coming of Francois would get '

together _in bars. and talk

' about——them. Women. They would

sputter into their beer and argue

about jump cut and montage theory

and—women. 'Film noir, Bogart
' and—women.

And as they got drunker and more
convinced of their own spectacular
talents, no woman came in to swap
splicing tricks. No woman came in to
tell themjust what they were full of.
No woman shared her special
developing technique, or argued for
the millionth time about Eisenstein.
No woman came in who was as talen-

ented and egomaniacal as they were.
If she was there, she was Francois's
girlfriend, his girl Friday or his script
girl. So Francois and Orson tottered
home, convinced they had reached
the truth about themselves and about
women. The next morning, nursing

, hangovers, they began brilliant but

wrongheaded films about women.
And all because that woman never
walked into the bar—until now.

She's making a film right now. Call
it “Jules" or An Unmarried Man,” or
“The Trucking Point." It will be filled
with the same kinds of mispercep-
tions that the “women's films" were
full of. The men will say it's unfair, a
gross error. They also will swipe the
film's editing] techniques, because it

will also be wrongheaded and‘

brilliant. Men aren't like that, Francois
will say. An academic approach, Or-
son Jr. will sputter. Listen, he will
say, let's go out for a beer. Let me
‘ set you straight. You're very- talen-
ted, but you know what you're full of.
Soon, Orson Jr. and the woman
will totter through the streets. The
next morning, they'll start a new
trend. I'd like to call it “The Real
Human Being Film."

But I'm going to write the last‘

essay about that one, too.

Pitt News Staff Writer .. t V .

The Electric Light.Orchestra, premiere classicists of rock music,
brought their show of intricate string music and Laserium-style visual
effects to the Civic Arena Monday night for what was easily _one of the
best shows of the year.  A “

Often criticized forthe bloodless perfection of their albums‘, the
British septet proved that in a live performance, they can put force and
drive into their music without losing the delicate combination of strings
and keyboards that is ELO’s trademark. T

ELO albums are solely credited to Jeff Lynne, group spokesman,
lead vocalist, composer and overall mastermind. But on stage, ELO
was a team effort. Guitarist Kelly Groucutt, keyboard wizard Richard
Tandy, drummer Bev Bevan, violinist Mik Kaminsky and cellists Hugh
McDowell and Melvyn Gale combined with Lynne (who, despite
singing lead on each selection,_ took a back seat) as ELO came forth
with a beautifully balanced-80 minutes of music. . - '

ELO did not feature the most celebrated of‘their stage effects
here—a giant ﬂying saucer modeled after the spacecraft on thecover of
their “Out of the Blue” album. Instead, theband opted for ﬂuorescent
green beams of light crisscrossing the stage, which highlighted the
group but did not distract from the musicf“

After some initial jamming, Lynne came forth _and announced in a

A heavy Midlands accent, “We’re going to do one you should -all know,

‘Turn to Stone.’ 3’ Theband launched into a polished version-of the
first hit single from “Out of the Blue,” then played the classic ‘_‘Can’t

‘ Get It Out of My Head,” which was” ELO’s ﬁrst single to score on the

American charts. . "
The band took a breather asicellistv McDowell gave a .solo

performance of various classical compositions by Bach, Brahms, '

Mendelsohn and, naturally, Lynne. As he played, beams of green
laser light danced on the Arena’s ceiling, spinning into spirals as the
intensity of the music increased. 9 ’

ELO returned with two more numbers, including an excellent
rendition of “Telephone Line” with a violin solo by Kaminski. Then

came the haunting “Strange Magic,” with Lynne’s. vocals backed by

Groucutt and Bevan, who left his drums for the ﬁrst and last time of the &

evening to add to the delicate harmonies. A

ELO went through a string of hits from “Out of the Blue”, and “Face
the 'Music”—“Showdown,” “Mr. Blue Sky,” “Sweet Talkin’
Woman,” “Evil Woman”-—the_band’.s intensity mounting with both
cellists performing wild acrobatics. “Mr. Blue Sky,” where Lynne’s
vocals sound amazingly like John Lennon’s, was a real show-stopper.
The songisounds as if it were the product of extensive engineering for
the special sound effects, yet the seven-man band was unerringly
faithful to the disc version, so much so that one would swear the song
was taped. _ _

ELO was called back for two encores—the ﬁrst highlighted by “Do
Ya,” a rocker from Lynne’s pre-ELO days with the Move. The second
was a rousing version of Chuck Berry's “Roll Over Beethoven.”

The show was opened by Trickster, a new band on ELO’s label, Jet
Records, who are warming up for ELO'during their tour. They played a
set of substantial British rock that effectively readied the 12,000 plus
crowd for the inimitable ELO, with the contrasting style.

ELO is not your standard band of rockers,__but, as Groucutt put it,
“This is for lovers of ﬁne music.” Quality, perfectionism, and

professionalism are ELO’s hallmarks and they were at their best at the
Arena—a level few post-Beatles bands have attained.

. — Viola Farber Dance Company,

Exploring Movement in.Dqnce"i

By PAT LAW and
SALLY RAPPEPORT
This year is proving to be an
especially exciting one for modern
dance in Pittsburgh. Lastweekend,
together with the Pitt Cultural Arts
Committee, the Pittsburgh Dance
opened its season of
Stephen Foster dance concerts with

_ the Viola Farber Dance Company. ‘

A 10-year veteran of the modern
dance circuit, Farber’s company
was received with relatively warm
success. Showing four very recently
choreographed works, F arber grap-
pled with concepts many in the
‘dance world are exploring today, all
with varying degrees oﬁsuccess.

The pointof her dances was not to
display, technical "achievement, but
simply to explore movement. The
dancers‘ were a tight group, four
men andvfour women blending to
form a solid eight-member dance

group.

Refreshingly dissimilar to many
other companies, the‘Viola Farber
Dance Company did not play off the
typical sexual relationship between
men and women in their dancing.
The women leaped as_ much as the
men. The men lifted and supported

‘each other as much as they did the .

WOIIICII.

poccasionally ‘exciting was that

Farber refrainefd from us,i'ng‘music-

)2. v
»~ / ,_  r:

for much of the concert. However,
there were times, such as in her

solo, when the silence created a lag, _

and audience attention was lost.

F arber’s,use of tensionwas both a
positive and negative inﬂuence in
the choreography. Flowing from
loose movements to tense ones had
a certain compelling effect for the
observer. At times the energy
source seemed to come from an
outside force rather than from

within the dancer’s body. This

tension also led to many disjointed,
grotessquely beautiful shapes, but
many were repeated so often the
choreography became monotonous.

“New.Work,” the ﬁrst piece of
the program, used no music but was
effective‘ because of the beautiful
rhythms created by the sounds of
running feet and falling bodies.

The most enjoyable‘ piece of the
evening was “Lead Us Not Into
Penn Station.” It alternated from

silence to a medley of music by.
- Andrew Asch to human noises

issuing forth from the dancers
themselves. This collage of accom-
paniment made for a captivating
musical structure. ‘

Another example depicting the
direction in which much of modern
dance is going today was the
simplicity of stage effects. Being
that the Stephen Foster is a small

theater, -the company members-_
[wore little. makeup, none of whicl_1"_

.-‘\ _/,-

distinguished any particular facial 
features. The costuming through- 
out was simple leotards and tights, . _
except for “Lead Us Not _Int,0 Penn ,0 ‘_
. Station,” which utilized plain grey A
unitards and occasionally silvery ﬂ 7
‘strips for adornment. '

Besides that, the costume colors
were either pastels, for “New? ~jj._'
’Work” and “Solo,” or earthy T 
browns for “Turf.”, To accomodate, 
for the extra stage space needed for? 3
the dances, all legs (velour wings)’. .-
were removed. This exposed 
dancers both on and off the stage, 7
another device used more~often_in
today’s theater and dance pe_rform-- 
ances. ’ A  

Farber, a leading dancer-With thﬁ,  
Merce Cunningham Dance Com-ism _
pany for 12 years and a performer  - -_
with Katherine Litz and Paul?’ 
Taylor, formed her own company  
1968. She currently teaches at her»;
own school in New York City, as well» . "
as at studios, colleges and - J
universities across the United___,
States. Her works'include collabora;-i. .  
tions with Peter Saul, John Cage; ’ -V
and David Tudor. T T - » 

The Pittsburgh performance was?
merely asample of what the Viola
F arber Dance Company is working?
on today. It was a sample of"the ,
general direction in which much of. a
dance is, going -today: toward? ‘_

"Paul Revere’s answer to the
problem was to put a man in a

church tower, give him a couple
lanterns and pray he remembered

' ' what thesignals meant.

North Carolina head coach Dick

- _Crum‘may not have to depend on

such primitive scouting techniques,
but it is certain he would ﬁnd it
useful to know _if the Pitt Panthers
will be coming"‘a‘t the Tar Heels by
land or through the air Saturday at

‘ Pitt Stadium.

_ , “I read that we passed the ball a
lot against Tulane and ran the ball
against Temple,” said  head
coach Jackie Sherrill, “so I guess
we have a balanced offense.”

 ’ Sherrill might be more pleased if '
 the Panthers could show some
f {balance within. the same four

”quarters.. V
North Carolina, picked as a top-20.
team‘ by many. preseason polls,
brings .a.. disappointing 1_-_1 record
into Saturday's game, along with a
new. coach (Crum) and a new
offensive system. The Tar Heels
employed the ‘_‘l” with great
-success last year; freshman Amos
Lawrence rushed for 1,211 yards,
the most by a ﬁrst-year player since
Tony Dorsett’s 1,586 in 1973.
Crum brought the veer from
Miami (Ohio), and thus far the Tar

Heels, andlawrence in particular, '

have had trouble adjusting.

‘ ‘It’s tough for a runner to switch
from the “I” to the disciplined
veer,” said Sherrill. “The runner
has to take certain paths in the veer;

of student affairs‘ for all , Pitt
Atheltes.

“On the surface this looks like a .

major -change,” said Bradshaw,
“but as far as I am concerned this is
a minor adjustment made to

' reassign responsibilities.”

Bradshaw became Pitt’s coach in
1972 and took charge of a team that
managed only one win the year
before. The squad improved’

. steadily under his guidance, and the

rise of the program culminated in

nthers Attack by La

he’s not free to take the ball, make
his cut and just run like he can do
from the ‘I’.”

According to Crum, a possible
reason for Lawrence’s sophomore
slump is that his freshman
campaign has brought him national
attention, therefore, teams are
paying more attention and gang
tackling ‘ ‘Famous Amos. ”

“Amos doesn't look to be
traveling as fast as he is,” said
Crum. “He slips a lot of tackles and
does not give a single tackler a good
shot at him, but this season, every
time he gets the ball,, he draws a
crowd.”

The consensus at Pitt’s weekly’
media luncheon yesterday was that ‘I

the Panthers have been trying to

force the ball to Gordon Jones even g »

though opposing, defenses have
made stopping him the top priority.

_‘ ‘Personally, I stick with Gordon a
little longer because he’s a great
receiver,” said Rick Trocano.
“Sometimes it might be a mistake,
but sometimes it might not if
Gordon makes a great catch.”

Sherrill realizes that forcing the
ball to Jones is not healthy for the
offense, but he also pointed out that
the Panther All-America will not
become a decoy. .

,“Maybe we've been forcing the
ball to Gordon,” said Sherrill, “but
we’ll still try to get the ball to
Gordon. We will get the ball. to
Gordon.” _ ,

The Pitt offense stopped itself
too many times with penalties and a
fumble, according to Sherrill, and
those types of mistakes are

last year's 10-0 season, the first

(undefeated year since .the late

1930’s and the Panthers second
consecutive Eastern Champion-
ship. The team currently is ranked
19th nationally. ‘

As director of the aquatic
program, Bradshaw will be re-
sponsible for_ both swimming
teams, the water polo team and the
aquatic club he established in 1968.
He leaves the men’s team with a
43-18 career record. '

Lewis has been ‘associated with
Pitt swimming for 10 years. After~a
career as a long-distance swimmer
for the Panthers (he at one time held
three individual records and was a
part in four team marks) he became
graduate assistant and then assist-
ant to Bradshaw.

“This is something I’ve worked
for most of my life,” said Lewis. “I

remember walking in Trees Hallas -

a recruit in 1968, seeing the facility

and the city and thinking how I

wanted to stay.” M

“We ‘have two great swimming
teams here at Pitt, and both of them
need "individual attention,” said
Bradshaw. “If we had not made this
adjustment, I don’t think the best
interests of Pitt swimming would
have been served.

‘ ‘It’s a challenge to me to take the ‘

women’s team and continue the
improvement it has made and make
bigger strides to a level we can all be
proud of.”

Al clnesley prepares to administer the ‘big hit’ vs.

especially damaging to a young
team.

“As I see it, the story of our
offense Saturdaywas we were a
block short of breaking a long run or
a second too late throwing the ball to
the receiver,” said Trocano.

Unless the Panthers want to be

the most predictable unit since the
British army in 1775, those blocks
will have to be made and the passes
must start arriving on schedule.‘-

Panther Poloists’ Party Crashed by iBucknell—Again  

By BOB LABRIOLA
Pitt News Statl Writer

Consider the plight of the man
who throws an expensive party only
to have his bitter rival leave with the
prettiest girl in attendance.

The Pitt water polo team could
identify with this hypothetical
situation after Bucknell won the Pitt
Invitational for the second consecu-
tive year by defeating Loyola
Sunday afternoon at Trees Pool.
The Panthers weekend record of 3-2
was «good enough for third place,
exactly where Pitt ﬁnished last
year.

 “I was not disappointed with our
Overall play,” said head coach Jay
Fisette. “Bucknell always starts
strong because its players are
playing polo through the summer,
and Pitt traditionally has been
known as a team that peaks at the
 of the season.”

‘. ‘The Panthers opened the tourna-
ment by devouring Vork University,

22-7.. in a game that resembled the"

earlyencounters between the lions
and the Christians.

The entire starting lineup of
Butch 5i1Va. George Machicote,
Papo Ruiz, Mike Mere, Barry Ford‘
and Carlos Rodriguez registered

goals before the half ended. While
Machicote and Silva were the
leading scorers for the Panthers,

   

their job was made easy by the
pinpoint passing of Mere and Ruiz.

Mike Schoﬁeld, starting his first remained in the half.

game in goal, did not allow a York
score until just ﬁve minutes

‘Srakocic photo

Pitt came back Saturday morning
and defeated Cornell, 13-7, to take
a2-0 record into the afternoon game
with sixth-ranked Loyola. The game
was a constrast in polo styles:
Loyola prefers a deliberate ap-
proach and/relies on its goalie, Jim
Rennie, one of the finest in the east,
while Pitt likes to play wide open
polo.

Loyola employed a sagging
defense against the Panthers in an
effort to keep the ball out of the post
(from where Pitt likes to r n most of
its plays) and hoped Rennie would

' be able to handle the outside shots.

The score was knotted at the half,
5-5, and the Panthers were still very
much in the game with three
minutes remaining and Loyola
leading, 11-8. From there, Pitt’s
situation deteriorated rapidly: Loy-
ola scored ﬁve times to notch a 16-8
victory.

“We didn’t pass the ball well at
all against Loyola,” said Fisette.
“They were sagging, trying to
keep theball out of the_post and

iwhatwe should have done was work

the ball to the wings and then into
the post.

Ed Gallagher spent his ﬁrst two
collegiate football seasons taking up
space on the Pitt roster—about
6-foot-5, 255-pounds worth.

“Two years ago I wouldn’t have
given you a nickle for Ed
Gallagher," Don Boyce, Pitt’s
offensive coordinator, said at a
preseason press luncheon. “His
stance was atrocious...I-I_e could’ve
blocked just as well without any
legs.”

So why did Pitt recruit Gallagher
in the first place?

“Because of his size,” said
Boyce. “And we knew he could
play. The ability was there, but he
couldn’t do what we asked him to. ”

That was two years ago.
Gallagher, after. spending V last
summer on theracquetball courts,
under the barbells and on the
practice ﬁeld with friends, returned
to fall camp a determined offensive
tackle.

. ‘ ‘I saw him pull out of the line the
first day of camp and couldn’t
believe it was him,” Boyce said.

Three weeks later, Gallagher, a
junior, was Pitt’s starting offensive
left tackle. With only one year of
offensive experience behind him,
Gallagher won the job after a
preseason battle with Kurt Brech-

- bill. V -

‘ ‘I told Coach (Jackie) Sherrill he
may make some mistakes,” Boyce
said, “but he’ll also hurt some
people this. year. He’s dan-
gerous.” I "

(Continued from page 12)
(Loyola) scored were junk goals that
happened because of laziness on
our part,” Fisette added. “We-
can’t afford to let that happen
again.”

The Panthers returned to the pool
for the third time in 12 hours to
battle undefeated Bucknell Satur-
day night. Pitt’s depth problem was
nevermore visible as the Bisons
jumped on the weary Panthers for a
quick 5-1, lead that was extended-to
a seven-goal cushion by halftime.

“Everyone was so .tired,”
Fisette said about the game

    

After Saturday’s 20-12 home-
opening win over Temple, Gal-
lagher seemed programmed to
,_agree.

‘‘I’m trying (to hurt people),” he
said.

Really, though, “He’s very shy,”
Boyce claimed. “He’s the kind of
guy who won’t look you right in the
eye.”

Unless you happen to - be . an
opposing linebacker, that is. Just
ask Brian Reagan, a Temple
linebacker. Reagan caught a quick
glimpse of Pitt’s Freddy Jacobs in

the third quarter, when Jacobs shot
off the left side of 'the_Pitt line en
route to the winning score, a
23-yard touchdown.

A glimpse wasall Reagan got,‘
however. "‘Yea,.l think I made a

block on‘ that play,” Gallagher said
later in the lockerroom. “I was
supposed to block the linebacker.‘ I
think it was Reagan.”
Gallagherhas come a long way
from being a guy, who, riding the

‘roster, was _in dire need of a set of

legs with which to ‘block, to a
starting offensive lineman who was
involved in his team’s winning
touchdown play.

“I tried just as hard last year to
make the team,” Gallagher said,
“but I couldn’t do what Coach
Boyce wanted. I don’t think I was as
bad as he says I was, but there’s still
a lot of room form improvement.”

Informed of his new job as a Pitt
starter before the season-opening
Tulane game, Gallagher told Boyce

he wouldn’t let him down. And

     

Bucknell eventually won, 14-6. “It
wasn't like the normal Pitt-Bucknell
games at all.” V

Pitt met McMaster-University in
the battle for third place Sunday,
and the game turned out to be just
that. McMaster tried to intimidate
the Panthers, but were unsuccess-
frl and Pitt won the consolation
game,15-14. Teams may have
trouble trying to push the Panthers
around this season, since starters
Mere, Ruiz and Ford have all added
upper body strength over the
summer.

Fisette cited the play ‘of Mere,

have to play heads-up ball and play
as a team if we plan to win.”

Senior striker Tim Pearson, who
will be playing against C-MU for
his fourth year, believes-tonight’s
game will be a turning point for Pitt
soccer.

“We deﬁnitely can’t take this
game too lightly as I think we took
Slippery Rock; that was our
downfall against SR,” -said Pear-
son. “If we want any chance at a
post-season tournament we have to
start winning right now.”

the race, however, and so the

winner’s trophy was awarded to ,

Dave McDonald, who ran for Pitt
last season andis now coach of the
Duquesne University team.

- Sam Bair_, ACC coach and West
Virginia University's Carl Hatﬁeld

Drexler (58th) -and ‘Barb -Bellish
(76th). '

Penn. State placed ﬁrst in ‘the
competition followed by Maryland
and St. John’s_ University. Penn
-State and Maryland are considered
thetop teams in the East.

Goff expressed her satisfaction
with the progress made by the team
this season. After last week’s meet
at the California State Invitational,
Goff said inexperience was, the key

problem plaguing the Pantherettes. _

Junior fullback Tom Liebenguth,
playing in his ﬁrst year of soccer at
Pitt, agrees with Pearson when he
says that Pitt is changing.

“I think we've learned a great
deal from our losses,” said
Liebenguth. “Right now we’re in a
transitional stage. “.1 think we can
make the rest of our season a
success.”

' C-MU has a veteran team
returning with junior sweeper back
Harry Brunache and striker Keith
Hordadt leading the way. Accord-
ing to Pitt_Coach Leo Bemis, these’-
two, added toan already aggres-
sive team, will make tonight’s
game an exciting one. '

“We always have had close
games with C-MU until last year

were among thetop ten ﬁnishers.
Gary Siriano placed 11th to lead
the. Pitt pack. ‘ Following were
assistant coaches Barry Harwick
and Mel Boyd who placed 12th and
14th, respectively, and Mark
Studnicki, 18_th, Randy Baily, 21st_,

‘ ‘I couldn’t have been ‘more
happy today,” Goff said. ‘-‘The girls
have it in their minds now that wefre
here to run, so let’s go ‘do it and do it
well. ”-

The Pantherettes host Kent State

V University Saturday at 11:30 on the

Schenley Park Course.
Goff was .optimistic about the ‘
meet. ‘

“The girls must keep in their
minds that they aren’t going to lose
and attack the meet,” Goff said.

 Consider C-MU  aDeCl8i ' I've Match  

when we beat them 5-1,” said
Bemis. “They are Very up for the
game because it means a lot for
them to beat us.~..“They are an
improved team that we are going to
have to play our best to beat.”

What impact does all this talk
from veteran Panthers have on
freshman goalie Scott Thunberg?

“I figured I’d be sitting on the
bench, I. never felt that I’d be
starting so early in the season,”
said Thunberg. “I never played
against C-MU, so I only know what

rs Enjoy a Run for Fun in Great Race 1 

Jim I-lerrman_, 25th, Bob Lang-
strom, 28th,.Dan Datillo, 30th, and
Bill (jarver, 35th.

The Great Race is basically a fun
run, with several categories for
runners of various skills. Several
competitors completed the course
byrwheelchair andplaced high in
the standings. ‘

This weekend will mean serious
business for the Pitt squad,
however, as they, travel to
Villonova, a meet that Penn State
also will attend. Not unlike boxing
your kid brother and then taking on

s Muhammed Ali.

The team will have to adjust to the
loss of McDonald and Boyd, who for
years assured Pitt of at least. first or
second place in meets. -

“We’ve got a completely differ-
ent kind’ of team this year, _ and

' instead of relying on Mel or Dave,

we’ll have to go out and do the job
ourselves,” said Baily.
