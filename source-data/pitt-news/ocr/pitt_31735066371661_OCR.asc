The Iceman cometh: a blues notebook {E

by Paul Anderson

When did the blues start?
Although some maintain that
they started when Adam lost his
residency in Eden, we are fairly
certain that they mutated from
southern Negro spirituals sung
during the-19th century. To pass
the time and ease the pain, slaves
created folk songs to sing and
improvise on as they worked the
plantation Fields.

From the beginning, this south-
ern black folk music had a bad rep-
utation, even among blacks,
which fostered feelings of guilt
and shame. Robert Johnson, one
of the greatest of these bluesmen,
was seriously thought to be in
cahoots with the devil. Good
Christian folks were warned of
the evil spells cast by such musi-
cians. Like most magical powers,
this powerful and cathartic music
continued to be misused.

Racist notions entered blues
just as they had in jazz. Many
whites, attempting to ‘assert their
superiority, thought ”black”
music to be as primitive as blacks
themselves. Some culturally
oppressed blacks formed a reac-
tion against this by developing an
elitist attitude that ”only blacks
know the blues.” Racial tension
has seriously retarded the spread
and popularity of blues music.

Albert Collins, one of today's
blues giants, sees no reason for
this less than subtle racism: ”Mu-
sic’s music, regardless of" who
plays it, black or white  I had an
all-white band for five years and it
sounded like black music.”

Integration

Albert Collins gained national
fame when his recorded instru-
mentals astounded continental
blues fans in the early '60s. Single-
handedly, he invented an entirely
original blues style, dubbed the

 

 

”Cool Sound.” Integral to this
revolutionary sound was his
aggressive and highly percussive
guitar technique.

While Collins was gaining a
great reputation among American
blues audiences, something was
happening in England that
changed blues music forever. Per-
haps as a reaction to the success of
the sugar—coated Beatles, groups
of young London musicians took
to the ”dark side” of American

AERT COLLINS

music and immersed themselves
into the music of the great black
blues legends like Muddy Waters,
T—Bone Walker and Willie Dixon.
Groups like John Mayall's Blues-
breakers, the Rolling Stones and
the Yardbirds incorporated the
heavy electric guitar sounds, gut-
tural vocals and loud driving beats
of rock and created a sensation.
Collins explained the signifi-
cance of this event: ”Blues had
been around for a long time  and
they started picking up on it after
Eric Clapton did his thing. You
know those guys kinda brought

’ the blues around for many, and

then things started happening.
The Rolling Stones helped out a
whole lot.”

This white blues reaction found
its American home in funky San
Francisco. Canned Heat, one of
the leading groups there, intro-
duced Collins to the city and the
white audiences there. He moved
to the West Coast in 1969 and
made several records with
Canned Heat.

 

After Collins’ introduction to
the new white blues audience, he
remained unable to achieve finan-
cial success comparable to his
young white emulators. While

blues greats like Collins and
Muddy Waters sweat it out in
suiuky lJd1D, ilicii yuuxub "\/A
shippers were selling millions of
records and enjoying pop super-
star success.

Exile on Main Street

The success that Albert Collins

rightfully deserves has continued
to elude him -— another sad case of
the artist intensely admired
among a specialized community,
(Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray
Vaughan and Albert King all
name Collins as their favorite
guitarist.) but unknown to the
music public-at—large. Although
he is very popular in Europe and
japan, American success has
passed over Collins.

”I’ve been working for a long
time and I still think about it every
day. I'd like to get one good break

 them guys come up here for one

night and have success. That
bothers me quite a bit. I can't say it
don't, ’cause it does."

To combat blues apathy in the
U.S.,-Collins plans to take steps to
bring his blues to the huge rock
audiences. To widen their audien-
ces, other blues giants like BB.
King and Bobby Bland have
crossed over and incorporated pop
elements in their music. Probably
spurred on by the meteoric rise of
fellow Texan Stevie Ray
Vaughan, Collins plans to include
some rock ’n’ roll on his next lp.

”I’m gonna see if I can get it on
the charts.”

Folk and blues

White blues has enjoyed success
as great as any other white rock ’n’
roll. Black blues, however,
remains a veritable part of folk
music. Is this a product of racism
pr misunderstanding? Probably

black blues and thus prombtes

audiences.

Some argue that thereason for
the problem is the music itself.

JITTERBUG PERFUME
Tom Robbins
Bantam Books

I will never smell perfume or do the
jitterbug in quite the same way after
reading Tom Robbins’ latest.

This is a wild story which spans a_

millenium and can only be classified
as an epic — if it belongs in a category
at all. I challenge anyone who's read it
to try to give a general description of
the plot.

It begins in the present day with a
frustrated genius waitress in Seattle
who is trying to create the perfume.
The next chapter jumps to Bohemia a
thousand years ago where the great
King Alobar refuses to go to his
death. Iitterhug Perfume is about
immortality, sex, the horned goat god
Pan, beets and a blue bottle of per-
fume that contains the secrets of the
universe. Making great leaps from
ancient to modern times and back
again, Robbins effortlessly ties dis-
tant characters with a strong and
spiritual knot. He takes outrageous

-literary gambles and gets away with

all of them.

Robbins’ nutty chain of events are
made even more enjoyable when he
cuts loose with his strange sense of
humor. His observations are one of a
kind: ”It was the Eisenhower Years,

the '50s, and things were slow. They
were so slow that if they fell off a cliff
they'd only be going 10 miles an
houn"

It's also metaphors like the follow-

TOM ROBBINS

ing that have become a Robbins sig-
nature: ”His knuckle began rapping
at his eye patch like a mongoloid
woodpecker drilling for worms in a
poker chip.”

Buguxea

On the strength of a bright writing
style and characters reminiscent of
previous underground hits, Another
Roadside Attraction and Even Cowgirls Get
the Blues, Robbins builds a special case
for the cause of immortality. He
seems to think that everyone dies
because we feel that it's expected of
us. It's a convincing job, because one
of his characters achieves
immortality.

In his late 40s, Robbins, who posed
for the jacket photo of the book wear-
ing a trim jogging outfit and a sexy
smile, looks as if he's taken a drop or
two of the elixir of youth himself.

Mixing a bubbling soup of fantasy
with a pinch of reality, he builds his
reputation as an irresistible and
irreverent story teller. ]itterhug Per-
fume takes the reader through 10 cen-
turies on a magic carpet ride.

THE ILLUSTRATED DICTION-
ARY OF ART 8: ARTISTS

Edited by David Piper

Random House

Renowned art historian David
Piper has drawn together more than
70 of the world's leading art scholars

 

and critics in producing this volume
that is admirable for both its brevity
and thoroughness. '
Iammed with more than 3,000
entries, The Illustrated Dictionary of/irt 61
Artists covers every major artist,
movement and school of Western art
dating back to the ancient Greeks.

Thelentries, which range from one v

paragraph on minor figures to more
extensive offerings for such visionar-
ies as Edouard Manet and Pablo
Picasso, are written for anyone —
from the interested amateur to the
experienced art buff.

In addition, the book offers por-
traits, self-portraits and photographs
of more than 300 of the artists, creat-

ing a fascinating visual connection

with the text. Separate sections draw
together reprints of significant
works from various periods, putting
the artists and their works into a his-
torical perspective.

Just as any dictionary is invaluable

for a proper understanding of the I

language, The Illustrated Dictionary of
Art 64 Artists must be considered
required reading for anyone wishing
for fluency in the language of art his-
tory. Its delightful embellishments
nearly make it an encyclopedia.

CENTERFIELD
John Fogerty
Warner Brothers

I suppose that some critics
could blast John Fogerty’s
return to recording for being
nothing new. I suppose they
could also say that, after nine
long years in the creative wil-
derness, if this collection of sim-
ple, earthy songs is all he could
come up with, well, no thanks
(and then retur_n to doting over
Bruce Springsteen and Talking
Heads). The fact is that, at least
stylistically, these nine songs
are not new, and that's precisely
why they work.

Beginning with ”The Old
Man Down The Road," a cur-
rent radio and MTV staple, the
inevitable link to Fogerty’s
‘Creedence days is readily recog-
nizable. The knife-like chiming
guitar licks and the soulfully
ragged vocals are a direct flash-

 

Silk-Ilr—8lI*

Shagging flies

back to the late '60s, and like
much of his work with Cree-
dence, the body of this new
album meshes a variety of musi-
cal styles, all pop-accessible.
From the pleasant bubbleguml
cowboy tune ”Rock and Roll
Girl,” a Ric Ocasek-cum-Bob
Wills and the Sons of the
Pioneers—style ditty, to the
Johnny Cash-like rave-up ”Big
Train (From Memphis)," Fog-
erty explores his past and
emerges with a spirited album,
tightly executed and produced
while never losing the small
club energy that he values so
much.

Of all the songs comprising
Centerfield, the title trackbrings
the project to its sharp focus.
Fogerty’s current desire to ven-
ture once again into the spot-
light is closely analogous to the
young boy who practices and
practices his game until he
grows up one day and realizes

-ll"-NT‘-ﬂit

JOHN FOGERTY :31-

that he can play with the big
boys. If all this leads to the fact
that John Fogerty is offering
nothing new, a question sur-
faces. Would you pass up a

second glass of vintage wine for
a Diet Coke? I wouldn't.

TEASES AND DARES
Kim Wilde

While album covers for
female vocalists are beginning
to resemble advertisements for
Frederick's of Hollywood,
London-based Kim Wilde has
slipped on a little black leather.
More than three years ago, this
kid from England was chanting
about the ”Kids in America,”
her first American hit single.

some — and toughened up, too.
Teases and Dares is her third
album, her second American
release. Her music can be classi-
fied as synthopop — betterstill,
synthopop trying to be new
wave trying to be dance music.
Heavily mixed and re-mixed
with passionate, raving syn-
thesizers (each synthesizer, and
there are many of them, is listed
accordingly after each song).
Yet Wilde's voice isn't at all bur-
ied. Instead, it rides the synthes-
izers like an Olympic surfer
cruising a perfect wave.

Part of the album's success
may depend on just how differ-
ent Wilde's voice proves to be.
Enticingly deep, it's a little like
Berlin's Terri Nunn. Yet it's also
dragging and "flirty, like the gals
from Bananarama. Only on one
cut, ”Shangri—La," does she try a
little too hard to get her point
across.

And ”Go For It,” Wilde's first
single and currently a big dance
hit, echoes sarcasm as the singer
plays the ultimate tease (There's
such an urgency in everything I need
from you/Stop giving 140, you know

you can't refuse me). What a catty

performance, you might say,
yet Wilde doesn't come across as
catty at all. Just very sensuous.
Tenses and Dares is a title
appropriate for Kim Wilde's
approach to music. Tantaliz-
ingly crisp production (mostly
from Ricki and Marty Wilde)
and an auspicious performance
from Kim, this album is not to
be missed. Surrender to your
deepest desires. Go for this.

Like all great blues concerts, it's

audience responds immediately to
all that occurs onstage.

Albert Collins tours constantly.
He has toured Europe 11 times in
four years and is in top form. A
constant guest at jazz and blues
festivals both here and abroad, his
energy is overflowing.

”I just couldn't sit on the band-
stand and play slow blues all
night, man, I'd fall asleep,” he said.

Musician magazine has called
him ”the most powerful blues
guitarist in the world.” The ”mas-
ter of the telecaster,” ”the razor
blade,” Albert Collins is coming to
Pittsburgh with a guarantee: to
offer one of the most exciting
musical events of the concert
year.

Friday, February 1, 1985

By Jim Urban
The Pitt News

Led by the continued high scoring
of senior forward Jennifer Bruce,
the Pitt women’s basketball team
extended their winning streak to
three when they defeated Provi-
dence 80-72 Wednesday night at the
field house.

Everybody has his fair share of
bad habits, but in a manner much
the same as dropping the cigarette
fix, the Pitt hoopers have kicked the

_ habit of falling behind early in a

game, and a healthier record has
resulted.
The team was plagued by losses to

Sports
Pitt kicks the habit, Providence 80-72

Villanova and St. John’s earlier in
the season. They fell behind early,
then came up just short in their
second-half comeback effort. Of
late, however, this has not been the
case.

With the win over the team from
New England, Pitt now has new life
in its quest for the conference title,
trying to repeat as the No. 1 team at
the championships in late February.

Bruce continued to pile up the’

points as the Panthers moved to
within striking distance of front
runners St. John’s and Villanova,
who lost to Syracuse last night.
Bruce fired in 19 points in the first
half as Pitt raced to a 43-32 lead. The
Panthers never looked back as the
lead swelled to 17 points at one stage

in the second half. Bruce finished
with 32 points and 13 rebounds,
while fellow senior Lisa Fubio
added 17 points.

Pitt, 4-3 and in fourth placejust a
week ago, is now 7-3 with contests
against Villanova, St. John’s and
Boston College left on the schedule.
Victories against these three teams
could leave Pitt tied for or alone in
first place in the Big East. Before
they challenge the Big Three, there is
some business to take care of in the
form of Syracuse University.

The Orange visits the Steel City
tomorrow for a 2 p.m. game at the
field house. Syracuse is currently 5-5
in the Big East, but they are fresh
from a big upset of Villanova at the
Carrier Dome on Wednesday night,

and they will look to do the same
here. Pitt has already beat the
Orange once this year — a 72-69
squeaker on Jan. 5.

Syracuse is led by 6-0 freshman
forward Felisha Legette. Legette has
been hot -— 14 points, 12 rebounds,
four assists and two steals in a 70-58
victory over Georgetown were good
enough to get her named Big East
Rookie of the Week.

So, the uphill climb continues for
Pittsburgh. Following Saturday’s
game, the Panthers will take a break
from the conference (if you want to
call it a break) and face 10th-ranked
Penn State Monday at 7 p.m. at the
field house. Then it’s off to Villa-
nova on Wednesday for the show-
down.

 

Yeah! The student section at Fitzgerald Fieldhouse

Swimmers to take breather

By Mary Daigle
The Pitt News

The Pitt women's swimming and
diving team is looking to maintain

their unbeaten season with a victory *

over Youngstown State, tonight at 7
p.m.

“This should be a low-pressure
meet,” said Coach David Belowich,
“because Youngstown’s team isn’t
very good, in comparison to other
teams we‘ve swam against this year.”

According to Belowich, the
Youngstown meet will serve as a
much-needed break for the team.
“We have a very tough schedule,” he
said, “and it takes its toll." Despite
this schedule, which has included
Penn State and West Virginia (who
are ranked second and third, respec-
tively, in the East), fourth-ranked
Pitt has managed to compile a per-
fect 7-0 record.

If history repeats itself, Youngs-
town probably won’t prove to be
very competitive against the strong
Pitt team. For this reason, Belowich
said he is looking forward to it. “The
team really enjoys this type of meet,

year." This type of low-pressure
meet provides the Lady Panthers
with a unique opportunity to try
events that aren't in their usual
lineup.

In Pitt’s 94-46 victory over
Youngstown last year, former co-
captain Diane Sedlacek gave up
swimming for the meet and took up
diving while diver Tricia Schultz did

BRUCE NAMED PLAY-
ER OF THE WEEK

Pitt forward Jennifer Bruce has
been named Mikasa/Big East
Player of the Week for the week end-
ing Jan. 27.

The senior from Carrick High
School in Pittsburgh scored 50
points in two conference victories,
surpassing Clyde Vaughan‘s career
scoring mark of 2,033 points.

Bruce also grabbed 21 rebounds
and shot 60 percent from the field, as
Pitt moved out of fourth place and
within one game of first place St.
Johns.

Bruce is putting her career scoring
mark out of reach. Her current total
is 2,075 points, with eight regular
season games remaining.

The team will compete in two
important games within the next few
days, hosting Big East rival Syracuse
Saturday at 2 p.m. and Penn State
Monday at 7 p'.m.

Gymnastics team takes on Owls

. By Jace Palmer

The Pitt News

When head coach Frank
D’Amico takes his Panthers into
Philly tomorrow to take on Temple,
he will be armed with a weapon he
hasn't enjoyed yet this season: a
healthy team. For the first ‘time this
year, the squad will be competing at
100 percent — something they will
definitely need at Temple.

The Owls, according to D’Amico,
will be “two-point favorites” as the
Panthers are underdogs for the first
time this season. In coming off two
straight meets of 267 scores (a score
Pitt hasn‘t reached lately), Temple‘s
Fred Turoff has one ofthe best, well-
rounded squads yet.

“If we keep it close after the first
three events, we'll be in good shape.
This is definitely our toughest meet
thus far in the season," commented
D’Amico. “It should be very close
because we usually score about the
same as they do. I'm excited and
looking forward to it."

The meet is unique because Turoff
and D’Amico have competed
against each other when they were
younger, but must now let their
gymnasts do the talking.

One advantage the Panthers may
have is coming off a two-week
break. Last week’s scheduled meet at
Kent State was postponed due to
weather conditions. Freshman
standout Jorge Sanchez would have
sat out in this meet because of a
groin pull, but he’ll be ready for
action against Temple.

‘Temple however, may have an
‘edge in being at home.

“Many of the judges are Temple
graduates,” D’Amico said. “This
appears to be a difficulty for us, but
it will be hard for both teams. There
won't be any favoritism."

After a slow start, Pitt has gradu-
ally improved their routines —— a key
to the squad ’s success. Against Tem-
ple, they need this consistency as the
Owls have an advantage on the pom-
mel horse and vaults.

“Pommel horse should be the

-key," stated junior All-East per-
former‘ Mark Klafter. “Weneed to E

win it because of our low score last
meet and because it’s the second
event this weekend. Doing well here
will be crucial to carrying
momentum.”

All-East counterpart Matt Peters
agreed. “We have to be optimistic
and go in there and just do our best.
We can’t merely worry about
winning."

Nevertheless, the Panthers do best
with a total team effort, something
they can’t be without on Saturday.
One thing they don‘t lack is confi-
dence, as team morale this week is
very high. Junior Marty Comini
summed it up by saying, “We're pre-
paring with a lot of enthusiasm."

Klafter feels the Panthers have
what it takes to upset Temple but
knows it will be an uphill battle. “In
order to keep a competitive edge, we
can only worry about one event at a
time,” he said. “We can’t go in there
looking for certain scores and then
be let down.”

-Sophomore Kevin Garren put it
all into proper perspective: “We just
have to hit routines._ if we do, we'll

Panthers on downside at half

By Mark A. Slndler
The Pitt News

A TV camera stuck its nose into
Fitzgerald Field House yesterday
and Roy Chipman stuck out his
tongue — a tongue from a face
redder than usual.

“We’re 10-7 now. Can’t you see
we’re trying to practice?” he sternly
replied to a late-afternoon interview
request for the six o’clock news.

If Chipman seemed angry, it was
with good reason. Tomorrow’s noon
game at Seton Hall marks the
Panthers’ halfway point in Big East
play. Only a 2-5 record shows for
their first-half efforts.

Will that record improve after
tomorrow‘? Tempering the reply is
the 1-4 grief bestowed upon Pitt by
the league's Top 20 teams. The
Panthers face all of those teams
again, and only Boston College and
Villanova at the field house.

“We still feel we’re a young club,"
a cooled-off_ Chipman later said.
“It’s not so bad when we make hus-

tling mistakes. But against Villa— ‘

nova or Syracuse, our ‘mistakes
came while we were standing"
around.”

‘We know it’s going to be a hard
time adjusting,” senior forward
Chip Watkins said yesterday.
“We're over the jitters and every-
thing that comes with a young team.
The first part is for young players to
develop. Now’s the time to look for
the wins instead of the losses.”

A starter for the better part of the
season, Watkins averages 18.1 min-
utes a game on a Pitt team that for
the most part is led by underclass-
men. Freshmen Charles Smith (14.1

ppg) and Demetreus Gore (9.5 ppg)

‘ On Philly, New Jersey and Babe Ruth

By Bob Travers
The Pitt News

I’m writing this shortly after
takeoff from Newark International
Airport, returning from a trip to
Philadelphia to cover the Pitt-
Villanova game. Since I couldn’t get
a flight out until Wednesday even-
ing, I spend a few hours taking in
New York. So, from a travel-weary
sportswriter 20,000 feet over New

Jersey, here are some idle thoughts.
to ponder while you plan where to

get drunk this weekend.

0The Palestra, the ancient build-
ing that houses Big Five basketball
in Philadelphia (Villanova, Temple,
LaSalle, St. Joseph’s and Penn), is
the type of building God intended
basketball to be played in. It has the
feel of history. From the steel girders
that support the stained arched roof
to the scuffed wooden ﬂoor, it looks

are first and third in scoring, respec-
tively. The 6-ll Smith also leads in
blocks (33) and rebounds (7.3). Cur-
tis Aiken, a sophomore at the point,
tops the assists (75) and steals (37)
lists.

“Our feeling is we have to win the
next five games,” sixth man Darryl
Shepherd said. “If we don't, we’ll be
in there, but to have a successful
season, we have to win. These are
games we have to win. These are
games we are supposed to win.”

Topping the calendar is Seton
Hall (9-10, 0-8), once again the Big
East‘s welfare case. Its only stand-
out, junior Andre McCloud, leads
the league in scoring (20.1) -— remi-
niscent of Clyde Vaughan’s scoring
crown two years ago.

“Maybe he handles the ball better
than Clyde, but he’s not as good a
rebounder,” Chipman said. “He
plays for a team no different from
ours. They make the same mistakes
at key times but play teams tough.
Toward the end of games they make
the same nut-cracking mistakes.”

In Pitt‘s 10 remaining games,
Chipman expects to give Shepherd,
Junie Lewis and Marlon Ferguson
more court time. Lewis might find a
niche at second guard, a position
characterized by inconsistency. So
far, alternating starters Gore (41
percent) and Joey David (36.5) have
offered no vaccine.

“Junie played well the otherinight;
Demetreus had a good game. Joey’s
in a bad slump, but that’s due to his
hand [two dislocated fingers],”
Chipman said of their 18 points
against Villanova (70-63). “Anytime
you’re inconsistent at a position,
you’re not going to fare well in the

not like a basketball arena, but a
basketball gym. The bleachers are
uncomfortable and so close to the
floor that a person sitting in the fifth
row could almost reach out and steal
an inbounds pass. I often felt I was
watching a high school game. The
national anthem was played over a
sound system so bad that the song
sounded like Billy Idol’s “Eyes With-
out A Face.” One more thing about
the Palestra is the crowd — a spirit-
ed bunch to be sure, but the locals
lacked the “bite” of a Fitzgerald
Field House crowd. ’

GT0 a native Pittsburgher, the
sports complex of Veterans Sta-
dium, the Spectrum and JFK Sta-
dium is truly astounding. Ample
parking and easy access to all three
facilities make it an engineering
wonder to somebody used to bat-
tling at Three Rivers Stadium and
the Civic Arena in order to see a
game.

OThe feeling I got from the City of
Brotherly Love was that Eagles
owner Leonard Tose left a very sour

league.”

If anything, Pitt has shown prom-
ise with its 1-3-1 (31 defense) traps,
especially against Georgetown, Syr-
acuse and Boston College.

There appear to be gaps in differ-

ent places. “Teams that are explo-
sive — [the 1-3-1 defense] would
beat them,” Shepherd said, alluding
to near misses against the Hoyas and
Orange. “Teams more patient play

well against it."

“Our bread and butter is the 31,
but at certain times we go man to
man,” Watkins added.

To ‘which Chipman said: “We’re
fair. I’d like us to play more ‘man.

, We’re a better zone [2-3] team

because of the newer guys. [Man] is
the hardest thing to teach them to
play. We used it against Villanova
before they pounded it down inside
to [Ed] Pinckney.”

Off The Boards: Center Keith
Armstrong is quietly doing his thing,
scoring in double figures three times
since the infamous second-half
benching against St. John’s. His 66
percent from the field leads Pitt; his
six rebounds are second to Smith’s
7.3.

“I feel more needed on the team,”
he said yesterday. “Not that I was a
castoff, but I wasn’t needed lor scor-
ing before.”

Seton Hall yields over 56 percent
field goals in league play and 79 ppg
— both at the bottom of the league
barrel.

After the Pirates tomorrow and
next week, Pitt plays Duquesne and
Providence on theroad.

taste in the mouths of many Philly
football fans. It will be interesting to
see how Tose’s threatened move to
Phoenix will affect season ticket
sales.

OThe areajust west ofthe Hudson
River in New Jersey — Jersey City,
North Bergen, Newark, Elizabeth
and Bayonne — should be con-
demned and declared unfit for
human life.

0While on the subject of urban
blight — I think New Jersey means
urban blight in Latin — I ventured
into the Bronx to see Yankee Sta-
dium. Impressive sight, and though
it still may be the house that Ruth
built, I have the feeling that if the
Babe were around today, he would
take one look at the area he’s in and
relocate in a hurry.

0 Another thing I saw while in the
Bronx was a basketball game on a
playground. Not unusual, but this
game was being played by a bunch of
10 to 14-year-olds at 1 p.m. on a
school day. Mmmm
