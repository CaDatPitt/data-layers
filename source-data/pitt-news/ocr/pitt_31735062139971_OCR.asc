Record Appears  
Featuring Two
Economic Studies

 

Two interpretations of the capital-
istic system are among the feature ar-
ticles in the spring edition of the
Pittsburgh Record, a quarterly publi-
cation of tne General Alumni Asso-
ciation, off the presses this week.

J. Steele Gow, executive director of
the Falk Foundation, discusses the
third report of the Brookings Insti-
tution ln “The formation of capital.”
In “Capitalism comes of age.” R. L.
VVilson, graduate of the University,
presents a critical analysis of capital-
ism.

“Why call it crepe‘.’,” another of
George Carver’s excursions into the
realm of the derivation of words, takes
textile names through the warp and
woof of their history to their rather
vague beginnings. .

Other articles include a study of
personality, “Superﬁcial personality
and character,” by Dr. W. T. Root,
professor and head of the department
of psychology; “M,athematics: Art or
Science?” by Dr. Albert E. Staniland
of the department of mathematics.

Present Legislative Session

Considers 18 llfodel Bills

 

By William Stark

In spite of what educators have ever
said about the impracticability of col-
lege students, the Intercollegiate Con-
ference on G-overnm.ent, held at Har-
risburg last month, indicated that col-
lege students can legislate.

La boring under no restrictions of an
out-moded constitution. these students,
from  colleges and universities in
Pennsylvania, adopted 45 model bills.
Of this mnnber, 18 have have been in-
lLl'()(lll(_‘E-Ii into the present session of
the Pennsylvania legislature.

Ah.-.(mg the best bills that have been
intro<luced, are: A bill providing for
permanent tenure of teachers; in-
creased ﬁiiancial aid to all third class
school distrl<:ts; the right of labor to
organize and to bargain collectively;
outlawing private police. a pet ‘will
that Judge ;‘~/Iusinanno has had intro-
duced for the past six sessions; Cl‘d.:.abl-
ﬁcation and consolidation of the 67
counties in the State into 17; a bill
for optional cii._v-manager in second
class cities; a bill recently defeated
in the House for lack. of inclusion of
proportional representation in choice
of city officials. The ConiTere.nce's bill
included city—manager for first, second
and third class cities.

The Conference passed a bill pro-
viding for consolidation of all relief
agencies in the counties into 10 dis-
tricts, but the bill before the Legisla-
ture provides for consolidation into 67
districts. In the. matter of income. and
inheritance taxes, the Conference set,
the standards at 40 per cent of the
Federal rate, while the Legislature
has a special State scale. The Legis-
lature is considering a bill to cause
all candidates to place a $35 bond to
get on the ballot, with the return of
this sum it the candidate receives one-
eighth of the votes cast for this ofllce.
The Conference set a. $50 bond.

In an interview, Genevieve Bl-att,
L37, (:o—(:hai1‘man of the C0nfe1'e.nce,
said: “Alt.hougl1 these bills have been
sent to their respective comniittees,
only a very few have gotten out of
committee. It is generally felt that
many of these bills will be pickled in
con_unitte_e,”_. .

Miss Welzstein Pulls

I
Xylon s Leg
By Leah Stark

Was Xylon fooled? Aleen Wet-
stein doesn’t use her columns as
receptacles for rejection slips, but
all her stories are written day by
day and copyrighted by the Press.

The Pitt News wants to retract
a statement made in the Monday
paper in reference to an error con-
cerning the source of Miss Wet-
stein’s column. Readers of the
One Girl Chorus realize the
freshness and vitality of the ma-
terial.

It was the interest not only of
members of Xylon, but all stu-
dents on — campus, that caused

change would be brought. about
in two ways. Firstly the pro,-
fcssors themselves would be
thrown into hostile territory from

would come home to ﬁnd their
—students in open rebellion against
the gospel. However disquieting
this might be to stereotyped
minds, it would certainly be a
fhorou;-;hly healthy inﬂuence on

From Hallowed Grounds

HE UNIVERSITIES must re-
lease themselves from hallowed
grounds and break down the
walls between them and the
streets of the world . . . The fu-
ture of the world rests in the busy
marts of business, in the noisy
rooms of factories, in the science
of labor—saving production. The
minds of men are ‘soothed or
made mad by their physical well-
being; and so the study of mod-
ern industrialism, with its attend-
ant inﬂuence upon mcn’s ideas
and actions, must draw the atten-
tion of academic study.
Not only must these universi-
ties pass on their knowledge to
the “zidullgs in lcadcrship;” they
must :-ttiiniilatc the whole inass of
citizens. Failing to do this, they
fail as si,9_;ni‘{ica11t institutions.
"assioii for the trui'l1, of the de-
grees to which knowledge may be
applied for the social good, is
ncccssarv if the GSSCIICO of democ-
.ro.cy is to be retained. The uni-
versities must expand into the
lives of citizens, through educa-
tional series, through radio edu-
cation, through wide publicity
about the results of its research,
zind by becoming “centers of
stimulation” for the students who
are a part of its regular commu-
nity. Education must serve as
aid to bettering the concrete
relationships of men.—The Min-
nesota Daily.

Dr. Craig Reviews Snap Show

By Dr. David R. Craig

IVR A STUDENT a. camera. stim-

ulate him with a coming exhibi-
tion, and let him sit under Luke
Swan)-z for a few wcelcs; multiply him
bv iifteeii or twenty, and you have
your x‘eSullS—-‘cl ;:ood show of honest
photoizraphs. Pitt's ﬁrs: salon is sur-
prisingly good, and does credit to the
men and women in it  well as to
the iiniversity behind them. It is a
pity .0 hurry these prints so quickly
off the walls.

Now,—a, juror reaiiy has no- license
to review his own scloctions, This is
so for many reasons. One of them is
that the other jurors may not agree
with what he says, just as in the judg-
ing the choices; were not always unani
mous. \V'l1at follows, then, must be
personal; it commits no colleague to
agre-cine-nt, and it is better to say so
at the outset.

‘Nell, then, the best facet of the
show is its straightforward character.
Here are photographs, not paintings,
in which a. camera somehow was sub-
stituted for a brush. VV.it.h only one
(3X(t=.-.7f)[lOI1 they are purist pl10t0gl'=ilJh5~‘..

here and there in }’itt:~xbur;:l1. The
exceptioii. "'Sprir.g" by Mr. ‘W. L.
Thompson, falls short. of the others.’
aClll€\«'E1'llt-‘llt ‘o+.>cause it was made on
buff paper and was toned with
sclcniiun to make it prettier. in
iiiziuy other .<:z2.lons its color would
have pi-!.SS(—;(l; but since in this one
the re:-‘t are lilac}: and white, and
mosl,l;.' glossly, it seems strained and
inappropriate.

For the others are glossy and
strong‘. Pnrism seems to be the next
destiny of phot<)graph3', and it  ﬁne
that these workers; are caught up in
it. V‘»'heu a zszroup of photographers
without any sense of tradition try to
inake a show, +1-ithcr ihc-,v show what
purism means or else they Show the
i11fl‘uencc that guided theui. If they
yicl<.lc=1l to any inﬂuence. it was that of
Luke Sw-..-..nl«; in particular and of the
spirit of journalism in general.

As much as anything, boldness char-
acterizes their work. Miss Milliron
with “Steps” and Mr. Lewis with
“Synng(,\:.11c" dared what no conven-
tional pictoriuli-.-zt would dare ——to
square away and let. fly at :1 subject
plunk in the middle of the pirrture. In
both of these they siiccecd. But .\:l:iss
L‘/l.il1irou’s during bc,~tra‘_vcd her in an-
otlicr print, “Mr. Hollid.a,y."‘ Her 016.
Subject would have llx’-.‘€-.‘I1 much more
emphatic if he had not been forced
to hide in so much waste <'.pa(:e. Bold-
cst ml’ all was ‘die pattern shot of Mr.
Colaiitzmi, "Scbenley Apai-tn1ent.s,”
easily the most exciting and mosf
original print. A close r-'<e~:ond. spoil-
cd only by a deplorable streak of
false "ii;-.:ht, was Mr. Nadler’s “\Vider,
Pleas:e"——t1‘1e scoop of the steam
Sll!?'VI:!l yuwiiing as the whistle blows.

The salon was full of life. Mr
Gehrcs' window-clezuier on the “.14-th
Four and his “4430 Class," his “How

About Sal1irday'l\Ti_s;‘hL'?" and all his

other entries show him to be the
roamingest and the alertest journal-
ist in the group, with the possible ex-
ception of the proliﬁc and versatile
Mr. Pickering. The latter’s airplane
shot “Sky Chief” is the most polish-
ed performance in the collection, in-
cluding even the grand prize; and his
candid reports of Cap and Gown, and
of The Investigation show not only
what these little cameras can do, but
what they are really for. Mr. Stone's
“Grandparents"-—-presumably they are
not his .-own-i-show_ a subject, common
enough but nevertheless new to
photograpliy. That amorphous dress,
like 9. gunny sack with a. string
around it, could never have been in-
vented. These photographs were
found, not fabricated.

But wouldn't it be unfair to the ex-
hibitors to siiggaest that they were per-
fect? W'ha.t they lacked most was
skill in composition. In pure photog-
raphy, of course, this is nothing more
or less t.l1an...sl{i.ll in trimming. and the
purpose of it is emphasis. If they are
trying, as journalists, to be emphatic-——
and what journalist is no"c?——the.y
should know more about. avoiding con-
fusion than they do, and more about
being clear.

For instance, Miss Milliron’s
"Mother Know Best,” quite apart from
its title. is confused; two boys on
roller skates are puzzling over some-
ilgiixug on the ﬁre-escape, and the be-
holder has so much trouble getting
up the !ire—c..~wape that he uﬁnds the
boys with (lifficult_v. Mr. Gebres puts
the strong contrast on the hands of
his violinst, but his title, and the fact
that it got the portrait prize, shows
that he meant this print to stress the
face. Mr. (;‘oluutani's picture “Boards”
con'r,ziin.s a competing turpaulin to
whicli the eye must return. Mr. Gehrcs
xvantcd to Show a winclow-was’ner, but
his cnipha.si.~'.= was partly lost by show-
ing" so much tone. VVoi-st of all, Mr.
Pickering. who can trim a print well
when he feels like it, was so fascinat-
ed by the reflection of Attorney Arens-
berg in the top of the table that he
left a huge insurmountable puddle of
white, out-of-focus newspaper run-
ning clear across the center of his
print. ‘Mr. V’. L. Thompson had a fine
thing in his “Sunning,” and he should
know that it would be accepted ir
many a so—callcd big international
salon if he _would trim off the ‘llSelt~‘.SS
and unpictori-2.1 gutter which makes
at least a fourth of his print.

Yet in a way it is silly to Squawk
about form and composition when you
are in the presence of solnetliiug that

"res and speaks out loud. Most. of
these pictures are full of a quality
that is perhaps less picturesque but
much more sincere and direct than the
offerings of the recent PlllLSl')ll1'gl1
Salon of Photographic. Art in Carne-
gie institute. VVe can hope tlmt this
c:~{hibit is a. promise for future years.

The Grand Prize‘? If you like it,
you need no vindications. If _vou don't.
then remember “South. of Scranton,”

Panthers Point

In Last Dual

For Pointers
Meet Of Year

 

Seek To Get Back In Victory Columns At Army Following
Heart-Breaking Defeat At Hands Of Irish

\Vith the Notre Dame meet over but not forgotten, Coach Carl Olson’s
trackmen went back to work Monday afternoon in preparation for their

expected uphill battle with the Army
afternoon.

trackers at W'est Point on Saturday

Saturday's affair is expected to be another nip and tuck affair similar
to the Irish meet, and if there are any odds atall on the coming struggle,

they probably“ favor ‘ the West ' Pointers.

Army has another great track and¢
ﬁeld outﬁt which is undefeated in
competition thus far this year. A vic-
tory for the Panthers will go a long
way toward making up for the defeat
stiffered at South Bend.

The Notre Dame meet was just an-
other one of the “break" affairs, where
it so happened that the Panthers were
unfortunate in getting their share of
the bad breaks a.nd consequently lost
a tough meet. The ﬁnal score was
67 points for the Irish and 59 for the
Blue and Gold.

Two more second places were all
the Olsonmen needed to reverse the
final outcome of the meet. The Pan-
thers scored seven ﬁrsts to six for the
Irish, a tie coming in the pole vault.

For the third time this season,
Arvel Fleming brought home high
scoring honors. Against V\’est Vir-
ginia and Penn State the Pitt sprint
star won his favorite events, and last
Saturday he gave the Notre Damers
the same sort of treatment. He won
the 100, 220, and 220-yard 10w hurdle
events, setting new meet records in
the c.entu1'y and in the low hurdles.

In this latter event he skimmed the
hurdles in the amazing time of 24.3
seconds. which not only set up a new
mark but qualiﬁed him for the Na-
tional Intercollegiate meet at Los An-
geles in June. His time for the 100
was 9.9 seconds. In the 220-ya1'd
sprint, he had to do only 22.7 seconds
to win the event. He winds up an
eventful c .‘_egia'te track career on
Saturday as far as dual meets are con-
cerned.

Bud Groat smashed the halt‘-mile
mark by traversing that distance in
1 minute, 55.8 seconds, making it the
second time this season that he has
broken the University mark.

Another outstanding performance
was that of Red Tost in the mile run.
Tost ran the fastest mile he has ever
run, negotiating the 5,280 feet in 4
minutes, 24.2 seconds to hang up an-
other meet mark.

Charley Gongloff was another Pitt
entry to contrioute a new record. He

tossed the javelin 192 feet, 9 inches
to beat out his teammates, Gene
Taano and Mike Sowiski, who ﬁn-
ished second and third, respectively.

Sieffert of Pitt also set a new mark,
his coming in the discus event in
which he tossed the Qlisc 133 feet,
10% inches. A-together, 10 new rec-
ords were established, with Pitt get-
ting six of them.

‘No More Pencils, No More Books,’
Everybody’s Through But Athletes

VVhile the rest. of us are ready to
call it a year, trackmen. netnien and
golfers face a busy schedule before
making their ﬁnal bow to the 1935
season. In two of the three sports.
tennis and golf. the seasons will come
to a close by the end of this month.
The third. track, will continue far into
June when the intercollegiate truck
meets will be held.

On the golf schedule there remain
but three more matches for the stick-
swxngers to wade through under the
Panther banner. Duquesne is the first
of these opponents, coming to the
Panther home grounds today in a re-
turn match that will probably decide
the city golf title. Saturday the Pan-
thers travel to South Bend to battle
l\otre Dame and next Friday the Blue
and Gold boys take on Grove City at
Grove City to end their season.

The tennis schedule also has but
three matches left. Today Carnegie

Tech trips over the hollow and up the
dale to Trees gymnasium for its first

unis tilt against the Golden Cats.
'i‘omorrow will ﬁnd the Panther net-
men in Washington for a match with
the Washingtoli and Jefferson boys.
Next Friday the tennis men close the
season against Grove City at Grove
City.

Plenty of action remains for the
track boys, the season not being com-
pleted until June 29. Saturday's meet
with the Army is the only dual one
left on the schedule. All of the other
meets are of the open variety; the
Pitt Intercollegiates at the stadium,
June 1; the CIC Champs at Mil-
waukee, Vvisconsin, June 8th; and
closing with the NCAA Meet at Los
Angeles, California, on the 22nd of
June.

Happy Landings. ..

We take this opportunity
to wish the Class of ’35
success in their new un-
dertakings.

Of course you want mildness in a cigarette.
And the athletes———to whom "wind/’ healthy
nerves, “condition” are vz'tczIl_y important—-

insist on mildness.

Lou Gehrig, baseball’s "Iron Man,” says:
“Camels are so mild they never get my
‘wind.”’ George Barker, intercollegiate cross-
country champion, says: "Camels are so mild,
they don’t cut my ‘wind’ in any way.” Bobby
Vi7althour,_]r., star of the six-day bike grinds,
says: “I've got to have ‘wind’ in bike racing.
For my cigarette I long ago chose Camels.”

Tommy Armour, speaking for the golf
stars, Bruce Barnes for tennis, and Betty
Bailey for the aquatic sports-—— all agree:
“Camels don’t get your ‘wind.”’

What this mildness means to you! - . .It
means you can smoke as many Camels as
you please. Athletes say Came1’s costlier
tobaccos never disturb your nerves--never
tire your taste—never get your “wind.”

 
 

-.

LOU GEI-IRIG has played in more than 1500 consecutive big
league games. Such an athletic achievement takes “wind”-
healthy nerves-“condition.” Lou says: "For steady smoking I pick
Camels. They’re so mild they never get my ‘wind’ or my nerves.”
