Chancellor Named Pittshurgh’s
Man-of-the-Year for 1954 1

By JIM DeWEESE

, Dr. Rufus H. Fitzgerald, Chancellor of the University
of Pittsburgh, has been selected as P1ttsburgh’s Man-of-the
Year for 1954. ~

A panel of 40 civic, religious, and business leaders in the
Pittsburgh area singled out Dr. Fitzgerald “for being in-

strumental in effecting a, partnership in which thecity and

the University joined hands, as has been done perhaps no-.

where else in the country, linkingﬁthe Universitys rede-

velopment with that of >Pittsburgh’s.” ,
According to John H. Alexander, Jr-., president of the

Pittsburgh Junior Chamber of ‘Commerce, “Dr. Fitzgerald

has seen the University begin the transition from a (‘com-

muting’ college to a campus school. During_ his administra- .

tion, construction has been completed or begun on ﬁve major
buildings costing over 26 million dollars, planshave been
complete on ﬁve more valued at over ten million dollars,
and three new schools have been added to the University’s

‘ educational curriculum.”

At a press conference early

Wednesday, Dr. Fitzgerald who my administration, much of the

;will retire at the end of the Year.
said, “I think it’s W0nd€I‘f1l1- I
don’t know of anything ,WhiCh
could come to a m_an at the close
of his career that would , be a
greater honor)’, »

The Chancellor was quick to
emphasize the fact that the award
was much more than a personal
honor. He pointed out ‘that the
University is more than a’ campus,
that it is the students themselves
who make up the school. “In order

to have good flour you’ve got to

have good wheat. We have that
good wheat. I don’t know how
any administrative officer could
ask for better cooperation from
students than we have at Pitt.”
Students First
. In line with his belief that stu-
dents are the University, Dr. Fitz-
zgerald said, “That’s what a uni-
versity is run for. What goes on
inside the students determines
svhat will go on in the world.”
-In reference to the expansion
of the physical plant of the Uni-

‘versity the Chancellor stated,

i“Whlle it has happened during

Chancellor R. H. Fitzgeragldg

credit must go to theiBoard of
Trustees, the Board of Deans,
and the University Senate. These
groups have worked together as
a team. The Board of Deans and
the faculty have accounted for
the academic progress which has
been made.” During his term as
Vice Chancellor, Dr. Fitzgerald
helped to originate the Senate
as a medium of coordination
between faculty and adminis-
tration as well as between uni-
versities.

Enrollment and endowments
both increased sharply since the
Chancellor took office in 1945. At
that time the total endowment
stood at three million, 400 thou-
sand dollars. This year the endow-
ment fund reached 29 million dol-
lars. This fund is a prime mover
in the University expansion pro-
gram.

Enrollment has doubled during
the past ten years. During the
school year of 1944-45, 10,802 stu-
dents enrolled at Pitt. This year
the figure was up to ~ 20,094. Dr.
Fitzgerald stated, “I do not doubt

...‘More ThanA Campus’

“In- ordr t '

good wheat. I’ don’t «know lio_w~‘any administrative oﬂicer could _’

DR. R. H. FITZGERALD
Man-of-the-Year

that within the next ten years we

rare going to have to be ready for

many more.” . '
Not Full, Retirement ,
Even though he, is retiring as
Chancellor of the University and
as President of the Association of
American Colleges,T.I)r. Fitzgerald
indicated that he will remain
active» as a member of the State
Department’s Advisory Commis-
sion on Educational Exchange.
“This Commission is very import-
ant " to‘ long range understanding
between nations. It provides op-
portunities for leading scholars
and educators to study in other
countries and thereby gain a first
hand knowledge of those coun-
tries.” >
In 1938 Dr. Fitzgerald came to
the University as Provost, a
position which he held “ until
1942 at which time he was made
Vice-Chancellor. In 1945 he took
over as Chancellor. _
Under his guidance,‘ the Uni-
versity has completed construc-

tion of a new ﬁeld house ($1,500,-

000), a new nurses residence ($4,-
5_00,000), and begun work on a
new engineering building ($1,500,-
000). ,

Construction has also begun on
George Hubbard Clap Science
Hall ($2,500,000), and. before the
year’s end, work will be started on
the first unit of a Student Union

‘and men’s dormitory ($1,600,000).

Last year the largest single grant
in the school’s‘ history‘, ($15,000,-
000), was received for expansion
of the Medical School.
In addition to the physical ex-
pansion, three new schools have
‘been granted official sanction
‘since the Chancellor took office.
These were the Graduate.School
of Public Health and the School
of Pharmacy in 1948 and the
School of Retailing in 1953.

Vertical Programming Planned
For Educational Video Station

WQED Alle1n.pts
Presenting Topic
To Varied Groups

By JOHN DE NINNO
(Last of a Series)

A plan for “vertical program-
.ming” for. WQED, Pittsburgh’s
Educational TV station, has been
announced by John Ziegler, sta-
tion program manager.

Essentially, vertical program-
ming would be an attempt to pre-
sent the same topic to different
groups of people in a way that
would be both understandable and
interesting to each of the groups.

For example, a topic that is a
currentevent would be presented.
to the man of the house, at a time
that would be convenient to him,
in a manner that he would find
interesting. The same topic would
be presented, on the same day, to
manner that she
would ﬁnd interesting. Also to his
children at a timethat would be
best for them and in a way so that
they will understand the topic.

Common Interest Provided

Current events is only one of

‘many topics that could be used.

“How to” would be another.
This type of programming, ac-
cording to Ziegler, is an attempt
at providing a common interest,
within the entire faniily, each
day. In other words it would
provide conversation for the
dinner table to which everyone
can contribute, he said.
Pending the results of the Uni-

 versity of Pittsburgh Research

Bureau survey, WQED will rear-
range their programming for the
summer months. This will be
to accommodate the
most viewers during these tradi-
tionally slack months as far as
television. is concerned.
Communities Featured
WQED is also concentrating on
community program projects. Ac-
cording to Ziegler, they are look-

ing to communities as sources for

many future programs. Each

community will be given an op-

portunity to be featured on WQED.
These plans and many more
like them are being made with
the hope that the ten county

, community which WQED serves

will cooperate and that the peo-
ple of these communities will
ﬁnd time to volunteer for work
at the station.

There are two kinds of volun-

WILLIAM A. WOOD, general manager of WQED, presents certi-

three student volunteers. Re-

ceiving the awards are (left to right) Richard Simmons, Charles

’teers—community and student.
According to Miss Nancy Evans,
director of the volunteer bureau,
there is a particular need for peo-
ple to work during the mornirg
hours.

Most of the community volun-
teers work in the offices of the
station, but they are not restricted
to this type of work. Some other
jobs that volunteers do are, art
work, writers for the WQED pub-

lication “Program Previews,” di-
rectors and engineering staﬁ work.
Volunteers Rotate Jobs

Miss Evans said that those peo-
ple who_are at present volunteers
must work at least eight hours per
week. She added that this oppor-
tunity to “do something” has given
a lot of people a new outlook on
life. Many community volunteers,
are elderly people who feel a need
to stay active.

       

 

Corporation Grants
Two Pitt Awards

Pitt students will be able to receive annual grants from a
2 million dollar a year scholarship which is being offered
by the General Motors Corp. These scholarships, which may
run as high as 2000 dollars a year, are for a four-year period.
GM aims to give ﬁnancial aid to college students with out-
standing talents, but limited resources. The university will

receive two.

Freshmen who will enroll in
the academic year in September
will be the first of the 1400 who
will be receiving aid from GM in
306 colleges and universities
throughout the country. The selec-
tion of the institutions are made
on the basis that at least one
scholarship is available to each
accredited private
which has 20 or more graduates
employed by GM.

The schools selected are given

a free hand in choosing students D

of high scholastic ability and lead-
ership. However, the student must
be outstanding in scholastics and
leadership, and must be in need
of financial assistance.

Grants will also be given to
private colleges equivalent on
the average to 500 dollars to
800 dollars annually per student.
The money can be used for any
purpose by the colleges, rang-
ing from higher pay for profes-
sors to offering new courses.

One hundred awards will also
be given annually on a competi-
tion basiswith at least one from
each. state permitted to select
any accredited college or uni-
versity.

Mr. Curtice, president of GM,
said that the program will con-
tribute to the maintenance and
improvement of the quality of
education, by oﬁering financial
support to higher education by
university and individual benefits.
“We hope it will bring to the fore
outstanding young men and worn-
en who will be able to make sub-
stantial contributions in many
ﬁelds

Druids Project

Student Block

To Pep Teams

The long pending proposal
for the formation of a student
cheering block has been un-
dertaken by Druids, men’s
honorary fraternity.

At their ﬁrst meeting of the
new year, the fraternity voted
and passed a resolution to under-
take the organization of a formal
cheering section for University
athletic events.

Ron Amalong, Col. ’56, has
been appointed chairman of the
committee which will. investi-
gate means of forming the block.
The proposed project would en-
tail the roping off of approxi-
mately 900 seats in Pitt Stadium.
Membership cards will be dist-
tributed to the first 900 persons
wishing to sit in the section.

Members of Druids will act as
section and row leaders in ad-
ministering the block. According
to Chet Zukowski, president of
the organization, “It will serve a
dual purpose in that it‘ will stimu-
late school spirit and aide the
cheerleaders.”

Paul Balles, Druid secretary,
stated’ that, “This undertaking
can only be accomplished
through the combined elforts of
the entire student body.”

According to Zukowski, Athletic
Director Tom Hamilton has of-
fered his support and will supply
ﬁnancial help if needed.

Reading Classes
Build Vocabulary

Students may increase reading
comprehension and speed by
signing up for a one-credit gen-
eral course being oﬁered during
next semester. Gen. Ed. 5-0 stresses
reading speed, comprehension, in-
stant perception, and vocab-ularly

extension, according to Mr. Thom-'

as Liepe-r, lecturer.

The course employs such ma-'

chines as the rate reading acc~ler-

_ator, the tachistoscope and pro-

jectors to enhance reading ability.

It will be oﬁered next semester
Monday and Wednesday, sixth,
seventh, and eight ; hours, and
Tuesday and Thursday, fourth
through eight hours. Classes are
limited to 25 students to facilitate
individual attention.

Trip Features Primitive Tribe, Reindeer Meat

lilliott Tours LaplandOn Horse

By BERNICE'M. COHEN 9

_ Talking with pictures and
eating reindeer meat for an|
entire -Week with one of the‘
World’s most primitive tribes,
Were the most unique phases;
of Charles Elliott’s trip to
Lapland. V

Duringea trip to Europe in 1953‘,
Elliott, assistant to the dean of
men, decided t-0 tour the land of
the midnight sun on horseback.
He had prepared t-o live on his
own, for the primitive tribes are
known to be unfriendly to out-
siders.

Boy Watches Painting ,_
However, Elliott stopped along
the road one day to paint a pic-
turesque scene. He noticed a- small
boy watching him for over an

hour from behind a clump of
bushes. c _
Elliott said, “I knew not to

make the first approach for he
would have run away.” Finally
the b-oy came over and asked
Elliott ‘in his native tongue if he
could paint too. “We couldn’t
understand each other,” Elliott
s-aid, “but ﬁnally I understood his
motions.’.’ ' _
A bond of friendship grew be-

Elliott’s amazement, he was led to

the boy’s family insisted that I

Tribe Performs Ritual

On the ﬁrst night of his visit.
the tribe perfor-med~ folk dances
and songs for Elli-ott. “In turn,” he
said, “I had to make a drawing of
a member of each family. They
put the drawings above the doors
of their houses so that I would

 know where they lived.”

Drawings were the only means

of communication for the entire

visit. Food [consisted mainly of
reindeer meat. “It sure wasn’t
like being invited out to dinner in.
America, I had to eat everything
and like it,‘ he said,

“All too soon, the time came to
leav-e. I hated to leave my draw-
ings behind. This was the only
time I was tempted to be rude.
They wouldn’t give up a single
picture. I agreed to their wishes
and departed in a wonderful at-
mosphere 01 good will and under-
standing.” .

Land of Midnight Su

Elliott spent three weeks in

Scandinavia where the darkest it

got was like Pittsburgh at 4:30

' p.m.

in winter. “I didn’t sleep
well for three or four days, he
said. Finally it got to the point
when I was so ti.red that it made
no diﬂ:'eren«ce. The phenomena was
surprising, but life went on as
usual.”

Elliott’s trip to Scandinavia, was
made possible by an award from
the Swedish Room Committee.
Earlier in the summer Elliott at-
tended the Coronation in England,
and visited Norway, Holland, Bel-
gium, France, Italy, Spain, Greece,
Trieste, Switzerland, Germany,
and Denmark.

Next semester, Elliott will take
a leave of absence from the Uni-
versity to ﬁnish research projects
at Syracuse University.

Such stofies have a wide range of reader appeal since
the Pit? Band is famous throughout the area in which the
downtowngnews sheets circulate. This series of stories on
the supposed integration of majorettes into the band pro-
vides an excellent example of a subject blown up out of

all proportion and shows just how deeply a newspaper will i

dig to ﬁnd a peg upon which to ‘hang a story. . Z
The Sun-Telegraph ran a story headed, “P1tt Campus

 Divided Over Ma_jorettes.” _ And thfsﬁbeforethe campus‘

,was aware.-that such a group existed. Both the Tele and

_’ the P.—G. misquoted Band Director Robert Arthur.

Sticking to the facts of the matter we hasten to point
out that majorettes is a term wrongly used in this instance.
The group_ under lﬁre has taken the name _of “Twirling

‘‘ Corps,” a name _which does not speciﬁcally imply co-
 existence with the Varsity Marching Band, as would the

I term “Majorettes.’_*_ .  ~
Fu‘rthermore,;‘ both papers wrung an almost unusable
statement from Athletic Director Tom‘ Hamilton, then placed
it in their article-s to imply an ofﬁcialisanction which the
group. does not. have. The Tele stated, “Quoth Hamilton:
‘It ought to be interesting.’ ” f
j Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”

No Depledging Please

A pledge, speaking non fraternally, is a rather serious
thing to make regardless of its nature. The term ind,i<;ates
an unbreakableword given by one person to another. And
yet, pledges are broken. I

Each year th_e
whereby a student may pledge a certain amount of ’money
to the various charitable organizations which beneﬁt through
the “Chest.” And. each year they fail to realize the full
amount pledged. . «

This year-$718 were pledged by students at this Uni-
versity. To date only $203 have been realized. The remain-
ing amount is needed if the*Pitt Chest is to reach its goal.

A By Joan Thomas
It was kind of stuffy in the
Tuck Shop ‘the other day and
Frieda and Fannie were enjoying
cokes in a corner booth waiting
for their luncheon dates.
Frieda: Boy, Fan, am I glad that
class is over.
Fannie: Why’s that? ,
Frieda: Oh, my English teacher
was. all rﬁed up about some-‘
.thing again. I really don’t
know why he teaches, because
he’s always getting mad at the
kids. , »
Fannie: Yea, Fried, that’s what
you’ve been telling me. What
was he mad about thi.s time?
Frieda: Something about some
kind-bf movies they’re showing
next semester.
Fannie: Oh yea, I, heard some-
thing,’ about that. They’re call-
ing it the Classic Film Series.
Frieda: Yea, that’s it.

By Irv Roihman
In his inaugural speech last

Tuesday, Governor George M.
Leader hatched a political bomb-
shell and_at_the same time urged
state republicans to ‘share his
roost.‘ G O P
members hope
he’ll have to
eat crow be-
fore the year's
over, especi-
ally on the
question 0 f
taxes.

- The Y ork
county chick-
en f'a r m e r
pushed all
b l a me for
drastic shortages

and budget
de-ﬁcits on the long—reigning Re-A
publican administration. But he
urged the necessity for uniﬁca-
tion in order to correct it.

GOP state chairman Miles
Horst started crowing when
Leader charged bankruptcy, and
said, “We do not accept the
statement thatpthere is need for

'$5»O»0,00»0,0'Ot0 in additional reve-

nue to meet the Commonwealth’s
obligation.”
Cabi°ne-l- Cuts Costs

To back up his concern, the
Governor has called Cabinet
members to the task of cutting
costs and expensestin their de-
partments, Orders haye been
sent out to cut personnel and re-

’ tract raises granted for “meri-

/

torious” reasons. But it is diffi-
cult to see these cutbacks making
any sizable impression on the
$86,000,000 deﬁcit.

The problem to consider now, .

however, is not who should‘ be
blamed. Political strategem will

force’ the issue, however. While’

Fannie: What was he saying
about it, Fried? ‘
xFrieda: That it is one of the
ﬁnest offers evermade to stu-
dents and no one is taking
advantage of it. ’
Fannie: Maybe because they’re
being shown so early in the
morning. 8:30. p.m.’s pretty
early to get up to see a movie.
Frieda: That’s what I thought too,
Fan.‘ It wouldn’t seemright to
watch a movie if it weren’t at
night. . ‘ »
Fannie: You almost need pop-
corn to chew on, too, I think.
Frieda: He said that the six
shows they’re going to run are
pretty good, though. He liked
one in particular.
Fannie: Which one was that,
Fried? ,
Frieda: It was called “Major
Barbara.’i Had something to do
with the Salvation Army. Rex

st,  
i GOP programs, and Leader slices
‘antagonists, attempts to balance 

the budget will suffer.

May Rel-ain Sales Tax
Republicansvvhope to turn. the

Governor’s nest egg into a bitter

goose egg. If they don’t support

his ﬁnancial program, he’ll either’

. be_ forced to increase the deﬁcit

or retainthe state sales tax. They
want him to retain the sales tax.
A major part of his election plat-
form was the promise to retract
it.

Last 'Wednesday, a‘ survey
conducted by the Tri-State Area
School Study Council, made
public ﬁndings that revealed the
rich keystone state has dropped
from twelfth rank in 1942 to 30th
place in 19'53~in c-u.rren~t expendi-
tures per pupil.

On the basis of per capita ex-
penditures for public education
from state funds, Pennsylvania
has dropped to 37th place,

The committee estimated" that
schools need $135,000,000 ad-
ditional next year to .c;1‘rry on
properly. From local experience,
we know that kindergartens and
summer playgrounds are being
cut because of lack of ﬁnances.

This is only one of the “many,

problems facing the Democratic
administration. And , it doesn’t
look like Mr. Leader has yet
devised ‘a system to make up
deﬁcits and also increase current
expenditures.
Industry Taxes Unlikely

The suggestion of additional
taxes on industry will only de-
tour management ienterprisers in
our state. Towns like Hazleton,

factory for Auto-Lite [to employ
3,000 people would probably ﬁnd

Politicians and Brainirusters

But the new governor has

chosen a cabinet of state workers‘
_who are experienced to advise

him properly. What Leader lacks

in political maturity, he might

obtain from such men as John P.

"Robin, new secretary of Com-

merce who has proven valuable
to Pittsburgh’s Mayor Lawrence
as adivosr; and from Mr. Jim

Finnegan, party brain in Phila;
‘delphia. .

But the Farleys will be com-
plemented: by the “brain—trust-
ers”. Leader accepted the mas-

ter’s advice, as he appointed,

numerous educators from uni-
versities and colleges throughout
the state to advise him.

Dr. Thomas Parran, dean of
the Graduate School of Public
Health; William G. Willis, pro-
fessor of political science and
director of the Institute of Local
Government, were among Pitt
people chosen. Also, G. R. Fitter-
er, dean of the E & ‘M school -is
advisor for Mines, and William
D. Schalz, professor‘_ of law, will
serve as advisor to the Game
commission and Fish commis-
sion. “ Y

A‘ combination
from educational institutions and

those with political savvy should

certainly provide -him some way

out from‘ this tight tax tempest.

University Bookstore Prices  

Higher Than Carnegie Tech’s

CIT Allows Ten.-Percent Discount

. Despite Similar Books, Equipment

By

Pitt students have been complaining for many years

CECY LINCOFF

that the prices of books and supplies in the University Book-
store are higher than those charged for the very same» items

at the Carnegie Tech Bookstore.

However, “the most important aspect,” according to H.

R. Patton, Tech comptroller,
two different institutions.”

“is that we are dealing with

A '
V

Non-Profit Stores

Pitt and Tech are both private
institutions from which no one
profits financially. Carnegie Tech
charges a flat $680 tuition fee per
year; Pitt charg‘es $16 per credit.

Both bookstores are owned
and operated on a non-profit
basis by the respective schools.
All excess money from the book-
stores is put into_a fund by each
school, to be used for educa-’
tional programs.

Patton said, “Any income to
Tech is returned to the students
insome way.” Recently, the Tech
bookstore was remodeled with
funds that had accumulated.

Tech Prices Lower

The policy of Tech is to sell

books and supplies at ten per cent

from list price to their student’ ""

body. However, there are cases
when the publishers will not allow
books to be sold below the list
price.

Pitt, according to G. S. Rupp,
comptroller, sells all books and
supplies at list price except
when fair trade prices are set by
publishers, “especially in the
sale of professional books.”

Used Books Bought

Two years ago, Mrs. Geraldine
McCord, Pitt Bookstore manager,
organized a used textbooks sec-
tion to “save the students’ money.”
Now,‘ students can get’ something
for their unwanted textbooks,
according to Mrs. McCord.

Carnegie Tech operates“ no

their students are professional
and usually keep their books.

Fins, Wrestlers in Road Tests"

 

Gymnasts Loolt
Ahead to First

Varsity Season

After witnessing this week’s
exhibition by the Swedish Na-
tional Gymnastics Team, Pitt
Gymnastics Coach Warren Neiger
appeared even‘ more pessimistic
than usual about his team’s
chances in the forthcoming cam-
paign. *

The Swedes’ near—perfection
prompted a- gloomy reply by
Coach Neiger when queried as to
the outlook for his proteges.

The sophomore tutor comment-
ed, “Although we are much im-
proved over last year, you’ll have
to remember that this is our first
year of varsity competition and
the going will be rough.”

Operating on a club basis last
year, the tumblers showed much
promise although they failed to
score a victory.

This season’s lineup will have
veterans in every postion but one
with two sophomores from Phila-
delphia, Joe Ray an-d Don Shima,
forming the nucleus 01% the squad.
Both will compete in three events;
the ﬂying rings, parallel bars, and
horizontal bar.

Joe Lamartine,' this year’s Pitt

"Panther, will participate in the

sideh-orse and horizontal b a r
events while rounding out the
sidehorse contingent are senior
Bob Schmitt and sophomore John
Petrakes. '

Seniors Bob Kenedy and Will
Starz will represent Pitt in tumb-
ling. Randy Cronau, in the rope
climb and ﬂying rings, and rope-
climbers Keith Lough and Dave
Ruber, the latter a newcomer,

_ complete the lineup.

Although they are not eligible
for official competition in the
rugged. Eastern Gymnastic League
until next year, the Pitt gymnasts
have scheduled six meets.

They will" meet Navy, West
Virginia, Notre Dame, and Illinois
(Chicago Division) away from
home before returning to encount-
er Penn State _and Ohio State at
the Field House. ‘ "

Navy, who will be the Panther‘s
opening foe January 29, has al-
ready defeated North Carolina,
runner-up for the Southeastern
Conference championship.

Frosh Court Jinx .

Geneva’s freshmen team did it
again last Wednesday when the
Covie Frosh continued their baf-
ﬁing jinx over the Panther Cubs
by beating the Pittites on Geneva’s
home court, 76-64.

Ruining the Frosh chances for
an unbeaten season and ending
the Cubs’ winning streak at
twelve, the Covies out—played and
out-hustled the Panthers to send
the freshmen to defeat in a hard-
fought, close battle. _

Revenge will be the motive to-
morrow night as Ben Grady’s re-
juvenated tankers battle Ohio

University in Athens, Ohio.

Last year’s star—studded Panther
squad barely beat the Bobcats
46-38 here at Pittsburgh and with
the advantage of their home pool,
plus the lack of reserve strength
on the Pitt squad, they feel that
this could be their year to upset
the Gradymen.

The Bobcats, who should be
a tough hurdle in the Panther’s
comeback trail, have won the
Mid-American C o nf e r e n c e
swimming championship the last
two seasons. -
The mainstays for the Bobcats
will be Tad Potter, Mid-American
50 and 100-yard freestyle champ,
Co-capt. Tgm Hartley, conference
backstroke champ, John Botuchis,
Mid-American diving champ, Co-
capt. Tom Richmond, Don Michal,
and Dick Maxwell.

Panther coach, Ben Grady,
though much impressed by his
team’s easy conquest of.VMI last
inclined to

off-night on the part of the

provement in his‘ squad. ,He
added that although he’s not.
afraid of Ohio University, “We’ll
have to go all out to beat them,
especially at their own pool.”
The mermen’s hopes of success-
fully defending their Eastern
Championship were considerably
brightened by the ﬁne perform-
ances of several of the Panthers
last week. /

Jim Zurcher, the ﬂashy Oliver

‘All-American candidate, continues

to improve in every meet and
should be of national championship
caliber by the end of the season.
His swimming mate, Bill Furrer,
has lowered his time to 4:59.3,
which is only about one second
over the pool record for the 440-
yard freestyle, and continues to
give Zurcher a good run in the
220-yard freestyle.

Roy Kaupe’s improvement in
the -150-yard individual medley
also has greatly strengthened
the squad, as have the stellar
performances turned in by Skip
Monsein and Bernie Bauer in the
backstroke and breaststroke
events.

One of the most signiﬁcant fac-
tors in the last meet, however, was
the large garnering of second and

Both   Squ-ads Seeking

Second Win Tomorrow

By STEVE BUTCHOCK

Following their upset loss to
Lehigh, Coach Rex,Perry’s com-
muting matmen will endeavor to
regain their winning stride at the
expense of Lock Haven State
Teachers tommorow evening at
Lock Haven, Pa.

Coach Hubert Jack’s Haveners
posted a 9-2 record last season
and to date have defeated all
three of their opponents with the
greatest of ease. The Perrymen
have split even in two efforts.

Since they are another small
school that is wrestling-conscious,
Perry hascautioned his grapplers
against taking the Haveners too
lightly. For if they should, possi-
bilities of the Blue and Gold suf-
ferin-g two setbacks in succession
would be increased. This would be
a rarity for the locals since the

‘wrestling reniassance captivated

the University.
Same Team Starts

Although not one of the Perry-
men won by a fall in their last
outing, the same team has earned
the right to take the mat against
the Haveners. At 123 pounds, Bill
Hulings of Canonsburg will be out
to improve his 1-1 slate when he
takes on Tom Musser.

In t h e 130—pound division,
sophomore Ed Peery will be gun-
ning for his third consecutive win
——Charles Goldthrays being his
opponent. Nick Swentosky of Car-
negie takes on Lester Turner in
the 137-pound class and Bob Cook
whose lifetime chart reads 14
wins, two losses, and one draw
grapples with Ron‘ McIntyre at
147 pbunds. ,

Don Huff, 1-57—pound junior
from Oil City,‘w-ho was decisioned
in his only encounter, is matched
with Henry Shaw, and junior Ed
Dewitt, a product of Washington,
Pa., meets John Elwood in the
167-pound division. DeWitt has an
overall record of 15 wins and two
losses in varsity bouts.

Here's How a
They Score

By DAVE MAZER
Sports Editor

 

as

 

Collegiate wrestling never pretends to be anything like
the “professional” kind that is seen on television and the two
sure do differ. -

The kind that Mother thinks is awful, Dad enjoys watch-
ing, and Junior claims is a fake, is the one that comes over
that miracle called TV. The other, which is just coming
back, is the wrestling that is sport and is prominent mostly
in the colleges. V

In fact, in the ﬁrst mat meet at the Field House last
Saturday with Lehigh, a Bethlehem, Pa. radio station broad-
cast the match back home, a procedure that is followed in
all their away games.

On the Pitt side, interest by is also climbing. With‘ the

iwrestlers moving into national prominence the past two

seasons with fine records as well
individual stars, the Field
House reached its top attendance‘
this year with the mat-hoop
doubleheader recently. The fans,
moreover, were almost all present
at 7:30 in time for the wrestling.

One trouble, however, that hit
both the new fans and students
who got their ﬁrst glimpse of col-
legiate grappling was that they
didn’t understand the method of ‘
scoring.

  

here during the between semester recess, andthis problem will crop
up again, we’d liketo pass on some pointers. >

‘Team scoring is by a fall, which is worth ﬁveppoints, or by a
decision, worth three points. A fall is counted when a contestant
holds his opponent’s shoulder to the mat for a period of two seconds.

The other method by decision, occurs oftener though. In this
procedure, the decision is awarded the wrestler who has scored
the most points. 1

This is where thehmost -diﬂiculty comes in because these points
are given-by the referee as the match progresses. He awards tallies
for the following:

2_ points for “take down” or “reversal of position” from a de-

fensive position on mat.

1 point for “escape” from defensive position on mat.

2 or 3 points for “nea.r-fall.” A “near-fall” is a situation in which

the offensive wrestler has control of his opponent in a pinning

combination and a fall is imminent.

1 point for .“predica.ment.” A “predicament” is a near it “near-

. fall.”

There’ are two other ways of gaining points, though they are .

not so frequent- One point is sometimes ‘given for superior, ac-
cumulated time of one minute or more of one matman over the other
andsometimes onepoint is given when an opponent stalls. ,

And that’s all there is _to it. Now while it" may seem a bit com-
plicated at ﬁrst, attendance at a Field House match.will help asso-
ciate these terms with the action going on. Take a, trip up there
after, the ﬁnals are over, it might stir your interest in the up-and-
cominga sport at Pitt. " '

Mid - Semester Trip

By GENE AROMATORIO

The Panther cagers have taken some long trips this year
.——especially after losing away games -for. instance—but the

still ahead.

After a ten day layoff Bob Timmons’ hoopsters will
start on a junket which will cover West Virginia, Army,

Puerto Rico. This trip will have
the Panthers playing six games in
only ten days in an effort to bet-
ter their 6-9 slate.

Two of the teams on the be-
tween-semesters trek—-Tampa and
Puerto Rico-—will be newcomers
to the Pitt schedule so th eir
strength is relatively unknown to
the cagers. When the Panthers fly
to Puerto Rico they will stay over
for two games with the Islanders,
Feb. 11 and 12.

At West Virginia the Jungle

pleasure of coming up against the
fabulous Hot Rod Hundley-—West
Virginia’s most famous contribu-
tion to the floor sport.

Some of the Timmons crew-—
the sophomores—-,h‘ave already
had the dubious honor of meeting
Hundley since he, starred for the
Mountie frosh last year when they
dumped the Panther Cubs twice.

In their last game before the
big layoff,-the Blue and Gold fell

a once again—this time, A101-96, in

a double overtime--to‘ Geneva’s
Conventors at the Beaver Falls
floor. The Covies, had previously
clubbed the Panthers at the Field
House 91-67. .

At the end of the regulation
game the count was all knotted. at
82-all so both teams went at it
again in the five minute over-
time. Once again the tallies came

’ out all even at 88-88 so both fives

went at it a second time. ‘This
time the Covies made it stick by
Spurting in the last two minutes
of the extra period to register the
final score of 101-96. ‘
High man for the evening was

Unpredictable Cases

By ED

FRANK

Some Wednesday evening if you happen to be standing
outside of room 132 C1 about 9:45 and see groups of stu-
dents bunched together and heatedly weighing the merits of

taxes and liens, or discussing

advantages, of openpor closed

mortgages, don’t be frightened, they haveleft another stimu-
lating session with the old "master of Real Estatelaw, Robert

W. Semenow. '

Mr. Semenow, whose youthful appearance belies the
fact, is in his thirty-ﬁfth consecutive year of teaching real

estate law and fundamentals

at the University.

He. holds the title‘ of assistant professor, the highest

possible rank for a part-time

Pitt faculty member, and has

the privilege of writing B.S.,¢

L.L.B., and Litt. M., after his

his name. But to his many‘ friends ,

he is better known as “Bob.”
Law Authority

Mr. Semenow has been secre-
tary-treasurer of the National
Association of Licensed Law Offi-
cials since 1931. He is considered

the foremost authorityonﬁ license _

law‘ in the United States, and his
Survey of Real Estate Brokers”
License Laws, published in 1936

‘with a second edition of it mak-

ing its appearance in 1.941, is con-
sidered the final word by license
law officials.

In 1929 he was appointed Di-
rector of Real Estate Law for the
state of Pennsylvania. In this
capacity he drafted the state’s first
code of real estate law. Forty-one
other states subsequently adopted
similar codes with only slight
modifications. He has also auth-
ored Pennsylvania Law of Real
Estate Brokerage, Landlord. and
Tenant, and Questions and An-
swers on Real Estate Law. The
last mentioned book is a standard
text for all law students cramming
for the state bar exams.

This tremendous wealth of
background would suggest that
Mr. Semenow is a high-priced
specialist, but it is impossible
to predict the type of case he
will handle. A good example of
this appeared ,in‘1949 when he
handled a case for 44 McKees-
port veterans who were being
squeezed by an unscrupulous
realtor. After a four-year battle,
he won a rebate for. the vets. A

Mr. Semenow gives almost as
much ‘information free-of-charge
as that for which he is paid a fee.
He is always willing ‘to help his
former students, including attor-
neys, bankers, and directors, many
of whom- remember him as.sec-
retary of the Evening School from
1922 to 1929 when it was known
as the Downtown Extension.

. Cross-Section

His classes have been a cross-
section representation of Ameri-
can society. Students have come.
to him from every walk of life-
from real estate brokers, investors,

A mortgage brokers, and bankers to
