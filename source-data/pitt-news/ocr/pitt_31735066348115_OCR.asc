VOL. 89, ND. ‘I8

MONDAY, oc1'. 14, 1974*

 

NEW YORK AP — Stung by
reports that he had been “less than
candid" in reporting his almost $2
million in gifts to friends and
political associates. Vice President
designate Nelson A. Rockefeller
insisted Sunday that he had now
told all. .

“lihave responded totally to the
requests of both committee chair-
men,” he commented when asked
about the stories emanating from
unnamed sources.

Rockefeller had been asked by
Chairman Howard W. Cannon,
(DNV), of the Senate Committee on
Rules Administration, to list gifts
made ‘to public officials and
associates between 1957 and 1974.

Representative_ Peter’ Rodino,
(D-N J) chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, had asked for
similar information.

Rockefeller seemed especially
bitter about a report “Rockefeller
interests” had arranged a $50,000
loan for L. Judson Morhouse, a
former New York State official.

The report, broadcast by NBC‘,
said Morhouse bought stock with
the money and made a proﬁt of
over $100,000.

“I had no knowledge of this, and
was not involved in this,” the
former governor said as he
returned from a walk at his estate
at Pocantico Hills.

Through a spokesman, he said a
$21_00,000 loan to Los Angeles
Times columnist Thomas W.
Braden did not fall into the
category of information requested
by Congress. ' '

.“The loan was a loan to a friend

the Museum of Modern Art and
wanted to buy a small California
newspaper," he said. “It was fully
paid off and was made in 1954 so it
did not fall within the time period
for which information was request-
ed."

The furor over the gifts and
Rockefeller taking’ the blame for
publication of a 1970 book
derogatory of former Supreme
COLlI‘i'.lUStlC€ Arthur J. Goldberg,
his opponent for_the New York
governorship that year, spilled over
national politics.

Representative Wayne Hays of
Ohio, Democratic chairman of the
House Campaign Committee, said
Rockefeller “might be in some
serious trouble” about congres-
sional confirmation to the vic
presidency. - '

Rockefeller talked with President"

Ford’byi telephone Saturday and an
aide said he had been assured
“there is not problem."

Drug Bust Policies Explained

Pitt Residence Life Coordinator
Fred Fonseca last week released
general guidelines for drug bust
procedures in University residence
halls. ’

Questions as to how the policies

‘worked arose after last month’s

McCormick Hall drug raid in which
six Pitt students were arrested.

Charges were dropped against four
of the students but two are still

Abortion Rights Coalition

Rallies Against New Law

BY DENISE M. GOWER

More than 100 supporters of the
Abortion Rights Coalition (ARC)
participated in a march and rally
downtown Saturday afternoon to
protest the “Abortion Control Act"
recently passed in the State
legislature.

Under the provisions of the bill
married women must obtain their
husbands consent and single
women under the age of l8 their
parents prior to the abortion. The
law also stipulates women on
welfare may not use welfare
payment money to pay for an
abortion. - ‘

Several speakers from some of the

waiting Grand Jury action.

The guidelines, first released to
Resident Assistants (RA_’s) two
weeks ago, follow:

1. The use or sale of drugs opens
the entire area to the possibility of
armed robberies and or law
enforcement busts.

2. If the RA knows that students
are smoking, someone else does
too. '

3. Regardless of the fact that
smoking has ‘become socially
acceptable, legally in PA, it still

constitutes a misdemeanor (under

30 grams i.e., about an ounce) or a
felony (over 30 grams).

4. Students must accept
responsibility for their actions. if
they are busted they should be
prepared to deal with the conse-
quences. .

5. University students are not
immune from arrest by outside law
enforcement agencies. If anything,
they are more liable to be busted in
the residence halls because they
live in a more concentrated area,
where more people may know
about drug usage or sale.

6. Students arrested by an
outside agent will be subject to
University judicial process in
addition to the legal process of the
arresting law enforcement agents.

Billing President Ford’s eco-
nomic program as “a step in the
right direction,” Pitt economics
professor Marina Whitman said in
an article published yesterday by
the New York Times that its
success or failure will depend
chiefly on the Congress and the
American people,

“The President's program carries
a risk of. failure,” Whitman wrote
in the article. “But he is not the
one who will determinethe odds.”

One danger for the program’s
success, Whitman said, “is that
the Congress will pass the popular,
anti-recession” and casualty-
rescuing- measures while rejecting

— the inevitably unpopular restrictive

ones, thus turning an. anti-
inﬂationary package into an inﬂa-
tionary one.”

Additionally, the American people

suffer most from this attack,” she
said. Referring to illegal back-alley
abortions she asked, “How many
more women will die as a result of
the Pennsylvania law? The anti--
abortion forces are not concerned
with preserving life but
keeping women in their place.”
Steffie Brooks spoke for ARC. “A
handful of men in Harrisburg have
taken our bodies in their hands.
Women under 18 will be respon-
sible for another life without having
control over their own. ARC has

beenformed “to fight any and all V

actions that threaten our control of
our own bodies.”
During the march and rally a few

anti-abortionists with signs were A

evident. A man in a car with -a large
sign saying “Let Them Live" atop
it drove around Market Square
while the speakers addressed the
crowd of about 200. Some of the
speakers took the opportunity to
address the anti-abortionists but
others ignored them._ V 1
The rally was
attended mainly by women but a

there.

Rocky Claims He

Told Whole Truth
in Gift Hearings

(Continued from Page 1) .

Senator James L. Buckley, R
Cgn., NY, said whether these twin
problems affected the “conﬁrm-
ability" of Rockefeller should be
left“to the judgment of the
respective committees.”

“New questions have been
brought to the surface,” Buckley
said on a local television program,
“and ought to be looked into.”

Senator Jacob Javits, (r-NY) said
Saturday he had reached‘ no

decision on whether to return a

$15,000 campaign contribution.

The senator, seeking a fourth
term, has been pressured to do so
on the grounds of conflict of
interest since he must vote on
Rockefeller’s conﬁrmation.

His Democratic opponent, former
Attorney General Ramsey Clark,
has made it a major issue in his
campaign.

Javits said he would certainly not
return the money “now and under
these circumstances bcause if I did
an implication of impropriety might
be read into the contribution.”

guidelines read:

1. Narcotics agents must have
search warrants if they wish to gain
access to student's room. (See Pitt
News, 9/18/74)

2. Warrant does not have to have
names of occupants, however,
suite or room number must be
present as well as embossed seal
and magistrate’s signature, as well
as names of those agents request-
ing warrant.

3. Agents must identify them-
selves as law enforcement ofﬁcers.
If they do not identify themselves,
then the RA or the student has the
right to question theirpresence.
Once they have identiﬁed them-
selves, and have placed student
under arrest, the student is not to
resist at all. If_ he does resist, he
will be opening himself for
resisting arrest charges as well.

4. The student has the right to see

the search warrant. If, however,-

the student asks .to see the warrant
and the agent refuses to show it to
him, the student is not to resist, as
this may endanger his welfare. He
is to note the “illegal” entry and
inform his lawyer of same, so that
this evidence may be brought out at
the hearing. '

5. Student is permitted to make

phone call, but only after
arraignment.
6. The involved students or

someone else should notify the RA
immediately or as soon as possible
of the bust.

Whitman Ap

(Continued from Page I)
may reject the appeal for voluntar-
ism and restraint, Whitman said,
forcing economic controls after all,
with a higher cost caused by delay.
But Whitman, who attended the
recent economic summit chaired by
Ford in Washington, applauded the
President’s efforts to increase the
supply of the nation’s goods, and
also the proposed measures to
combat restrictions on agricultural
production, 1 to “energize” the
energy policy, to provide rigorous
enforcement of the anti-trust laws,
and the steps to eliminate several
price-raising restrictions.
Whitman characterized these
policies as aiding in the long term
ﬁght against inﬂation, but also
praised the President’s attempt to

solve the “acute short run
problem” which is that “restrictive
policies required to reduce inﬂation
still also, and ﬁrst, reduce ‘real
growth and increase unemploy-
ment.”

The proposed public service
employment program, and the
combination of a tax surcharge on
corporate incomes with an increase
in the investment credit were
cheered by Whitman as solutions
“we cannot afford not to try.”

Like many economists across the
nation, Whitman was highly critical
of the proposed five percent tax
surcharge on families with income
levels of $15,000 or more,. a
measure Whitman called “a
blockbuster.”

academic Obligations

__When the redrafts of the policy guidelines on Academic Integrity are
discussed at the Senate Council meeting today, Council members
jhould examine the sections on student and faculty responsibilities to
bfecertain the original intent of the earlier draft has been preserved.
The policy statements were originally drafted by the University
Senate Student Affairs Committee and the Tenure and Academic
Freedom Committee and were presented to the Senate Council for its
ipproval nearly a month ago. The statement proposed guidelines of
academic integrity. for both students and faculty. The issue was
referred back to the two Senate Committees to resolve questions’ of
indeﬁnite phraseology and other objections from Council members.
there are some deﬁciencies in the list on faculty obligations,
theestablishmentofsuchguidelinesisastepintherightdirection.
The policy statement clearly indicate that faculty in addition to
students have a detailed list of obligations. According to the report,
faculty are obligated to prepare and meet their classes and other
scheduled student appointments and base all academic evaluations
pen good-faith professional judgement. Additionally, students would '
 be victimized by faculty members who take advantage of the
professional student-teacher relationship for private purposes which
,.infringe upon a student’s inalienable right of free choice.

But most importantly the report specifies that faculty have an
bligation to describe to students within the course add-drop period the
content and objectives of a course, and the methods and standards of
evaluations.

, O However, the guidelines also contain a provision which could infringe
= upon a student’s right of privacy. The section states a faculty member
inny release information regarding a student  in’University
 without documentation of a student’s consent if the faculty
 “reasombly perceived that the student  the request
 a recommendation, in response to apparent bona ﬁde inquiries.”
 are not permitted full access to their University records, and
 this provision the potential is great that unknown and
 information of a conﬁdential nature will be released
;jj[j_ ropriately and inwmperlx

 Senate Council should scrutinize and alter this provision so as to
V.piieserve without question a student’s right of privacy.

,f.;According to the policy statement a student could initiate grievance
procedures against a faculty member if the faculty meinber has failed
to meet his speciﬁed obligations. Unfortunately, however, the
2; guidelines also preserve the faculty member’s “interest” in
conﬁdentiality in these matters. If a faculty member is alleged to have
3 failed to discharge his function as an educator, all students should have
access to such infomiation so they, too, will not be burdened with a
teacher unable and unwilling to discharge his appropriate duties. Quite
clearly the student’s interest should come ﬁrst.

A The establishment of a systematized procedure which would 
-an efﬁcient and equitable means of protecting students from the imfair
practices of a faculty member is imperative. Overall, the guidelines are
responsive to that need. '

We trust that the Senate Council will reexamine those provisions
singled out in this editorial as being inadequate. And we trust our
Student Government representatives who are members of the Council
will not allow these issues to be ignored or" disregarded by the
.non-student members of the Senate Council.

For the Sake of Education

BY JACK BELZER
lread Dean Marshall's article in
the Pitt News of October 2 with
great interest and several things
came to my mind, one of which is
why are people so career oriented?

True, there are people who wish
to do something very specific who
know exactly what they want to "do
and they have a drive to meet their
goals. These are people who want
to be engineers, teachers, nurses,
doctors, or lawyers.

But these people are in the
minority in our society. Our
economy is being run by reasona-
bly intelligent people who are none
of the above things. I

How about an education for the
‘sake of an education? Adaptability
is more rewarding and has greater
acceptability in our society than
specialization. Intelligent people
learn more about their jobs through
experience after they leavejschool
than they do in a formal academic
environment. My limited feedback
indicates that the most successful
people are those who come into a

Letter to the Editor

Dear Editor.

It's about time that the College of
Arts and Sciences agreed to discuss
the question of relevancy and the
Liberal Arts curriculum. Dean
Marshall (CAS) is correct in per-
ceiving a problem in the growing
concerns of_st_udents about the lack
of career’ preparation within CAS.
In view of this country's economic
situation, it's a problem that
threatens more ominously each
day. I applaud his efforts to face up
to the problem and his willingness
to consider alternatives that
would shift the focus of undergrad-
uate education. A

lf Dean Marshall is serious about
exploring new directions that
would soften the distinction bet-

ween the traditional Liberal Arts

field with a completely different
background and training than for
what the job call. They bring a
fresh point of view to problems.

People with a Liberal Arts
education are on the average, more
intelligent and worldly than those
without it. But there is another
aspect to be considered, and, that
is why an education in the first
place.

It is a two-edged sword. One is
you can probably earn more,
thereby, having a higher standard
of living, and the other is you can
live better because you can
appreciate more the things which
contribute to a better life. This is
precisely the point. Then, why not
an education for the sake of an
education? The rewards can be
great.

Here is a way in which it can work.
A person gets an education, and
then decides what he wants to do,
or, he can look around and see
where the opportunities lie. Several
alternatives are open to him.

One is, he gets a job and

education and career preparation,
he should consider removing the
obstacle that CAS has placed in the
paths of students seeking to pre-
pare themselves for a career in the
military.

Restoration of credit for ROTC
within CAS is long overdue. It
simply isn’t fair to penalize a
student who wants to combine a
Liberal Arts education with service
to his country as a military officer.
Other schools within the University
allow a student to use ROTC
courses to satisfy degree require-
ments. The School of General
Studies, for example, treats ROTC
as a professional area of specializa-
tion just like Information Sciences,
Urban Policy, or Management.

CAS mandates that, while provid-

The Legend’s Last Chapter

BY RON CICHOWICZ

Few men ever find themselves in
a position where they can turn
down a presidential nomination two
years before the primaries. But
then. few men find themselves in a
position where their last name is
Kennedy. "

Ted‘ Kennedy has put an unusual
ending _ to the Kennedy family
history, if indeed it is the end. His
older brother. Jack. pursued the
presidency, was successful, and
died at the hands of an assassin.
Brother Bobby pursued the presi-
dency, was unsuccessful, and died
at the hands of an assassin. And
now Ted will not pursue the
presidency...

When viewing the situation from
this perspective, it is easy to see
why Ted Kennedy does not wish to
run. But I don’t believe that fear
really played that much a part in
his decision. Nor do I buy
Kennedy’s statement about family

. and personal considerations.

1 don't expect this to come as a

 

shock to anyone or as a novel
opinion. but the ‘only reason Ted
Kennedy will not run for President
is the Chappaquiddick issue. And

._that would not even have been an

issue if not for the Watergate
fiasco.

lt is not easy to deny the
possibility that Kennedy is simply
afraid to campaign at first. and no
one could blame him if he is. But
just staying out of the presidential
race will not take him off the
endangered species list. The
Kennedys have already assured
themselves a place in American
history and, unfortunately, a place
for their assassins.

Any nobody with a gun would
become a household name whether
his victim was Senator Edward
Kennedy or President Edward
Kennedy. As a matter of fact, as
President, Kennedy would actually
have more protection than he does
now.

The other reason Kennedy gave
for hisgdecision, personal consid,

      
 

continues his education on a
part-time basis. His continuing
education can be to enhance his
new position,‘ or to pursue
knowledge he wishes to acquire, or
to study something which will be
fun.

Another alternative is, upon
achieving his baccalaureate, he
may decide what he wishes to do
and continue his graduate studies
in a professional school achieving
his goal. Of course, he can if he
wishes, continue his education in
Liberal Arts. ’

If the Liberal Arts program was a
little more liberal and permitted
students to do a little more
specializing in a job-oriented
discipline, it too would be more
adaptable. A Liberal Arts educa-
tion under those conditions would
be an excellent jumping-off point to
life.

[Jack Belzer is a Professor of
Industrial Engineering and the
Interdisciplinary Program in Infor-
mation Science.]

ROTC and the Liberal Arts

ing a well-rounded Liberal Arts
education, a student must satisfy
requirements in a major field of
study. A full-time undergraduate
major in military science is not
requested; just consideration of the
existing ROTC courses as com-

mensurate with other preparatory g

and elective courses. It’s time that
CAS followed the lead of other
schools here at Pitt in correcting an
injustice left over from the Vietnam
War era. Dean Marshall can
begin by providing the “willing-
ness to debate regularly anew the
issues of why we exist at all, let
alone in the ways we do."

Sincerely,
William R. Nebel
CAS ’7S

erations, seem equally shaky. The
lure of power is very enticing,
particularly to those with a real
chance to attain it. Kennedy has
never allowed his personal life to
interfere with his dedication to the
country. This, mainly because he
and his brothers have always held a
sincere belief that they could give
the nation something no other man
has, be it leadership, hope, or
inspiration. And when one holds
this belief, family just does not

_ interfere.

And so, that leaves us with the
only possible reason--Chappiquid-
dick. ‘Since Watergate, every
political candidate will be subject to
much personal scrutiny in order to
determine their moral character.

‘Judging from his actions, Ted

Kennedy has much he would rather
keep to himself. 50 strong is his
desire for personal secrecy that he
is willing to give up a chance at the
presidency to keep it. And in doing
so, he may have written the last
chapter to the Kennedy Legend. ,

Health Care in
Indigent Areas

Dear Editor;

It is with absolute amazement that
I read the article on the medical
and dental school reaction to the
passage of Senate Bill 3585, which
would require two years service in
a "medically underserviced" area
ofthe country, in the September 27

issue of the Pitt News. The medical _

and dental establishment has had
time enough to play with the
problem of medically indigent
areas and has failed miserably.
They should not be surprised that
the government has decided to step
in with their ideas for a solution to
the problem.

However, the particular method of
distributing adequate health care is
beside the point. I would like to
address my comments to several
quotes attributed to members of
the medical and dental establish-
ment including students.

Associate Dean [dental school] W.
Arthur George predicts that
“should the bill be put into law, the
number of applicants to these two
professional schools might de-
crease, causing a shortage of

 doctors and dentists everywhere.”

Who is this joker trying to bullshit?
Certainly not the thousands of
qualified medical and dental school
applicants turned down each year.

Being in this category myself, I can

say that I would be happy to serve a
medically indigent area for two
years in return for the privilege of
practicing inedicine. Dr. George’s

prediction might scare the House of

Representatives but in the eyes of
those trying to get into professional
schools it’s pure garbage.

Dr. Robert Carroll, board member
of Comprehensive Planning in Al-
legheny Country calls the bill
“involuntary servitude” and says
that the US Senate “is far more
irresponsible” than the House and
is sure that the bill would never
pass the House. What he means is
that the House is far more sus-
ceptible to pressure from organized
medicine and that the final com-
promise will be nothing more than
maintenance of the status quo.
Referring to a doctor forced into a
medically indigent area for two
years he states, “I'd hate to be a
patient of one of these doctors."
Obviously this “healer” has for-
gotten about the Oath of Hippo-
crates to which all physicians
supposedly subscribe.

Dental school senior Paul Petru-
nak laments that he doesn't see
why they (students) should “jeo-
pardize our practices by working in
underdeveloped areas.” The arti-
cle did not note that for two years,
those serving would not be making
the amount of money that those in
private practice would. Mr. Pe-
trunak forgot to insert the word
“lucrative” before “practice” and
this statement sheds light on his
value orientation.

Letters to the Editor

And finally, dental school student
Jerry Petro moronically suggests
that “the government should airlift
tons of toothpaste and dental floss

to any place that needs help that

bad (sic)...and tell them to watch
between-meal treats.” This asi-
nine statement reveals a gross
insensitivity to the problems of
underserved areas and shows. the
Mr. Petro is in possession of all the
ethical considerations of a cretin..

If these comments are a true
reflection of the attitudes in the
health care establishment, the
government should not only enact
Seante Bill 3585, but should con-
sider making willingness to serve a
prerequisite to gaining entrance to
professional schools.

Miss Popularity

Tradition Decrieo’

To the Editor:

1 had thought that the University
of Pittsburgh was above the cutesy
Miss Popularity—Beauty Queen
contest, and that the women stu-
dents at Pitt counted for more than
mere competitors in such contests.
Unfortunately, the School of Gen-
eral Studies has shown us all where

"its head is at.

By buying control of the Home-
coming Person event for the ex-
press purpose of maintaining the
“traditional” stereotype of women

as pretty little Miss Popularity, the

School of General Studies has
demonstrated that it has little
respect for the personhood of
women. We must all be “queens”
or we count for nothing.

It is obvious that the School of
General Studies objected to a
Homecoming Person because men

‘would be included in such a

contest. Yes, indeed, a beauty-_f
popularity contest for men is rather ’
degrading, isn’t it? But as for
women, the SGS tells us, tliey have '
no brains—or shouldn't, at any}?
rate—so they are ideally suited for- ;
the role of beauty “queen.” I
And to the women in the School of
General Studies, I sincerely hope"
you are all beautiful, stupid,‘ silly
and useless—for that is exactly‘.
what a Homecoming “Queen” is} .
and that is the image SGS wants t .
project of you. As for the rest of us, *
I trust we have more respect for"-
ourselves than that. p S ,

images which officially represents

an organization. It should capture

the image of that organization.
“Pitt had a problem," said

Assistant Vic Chancellor of Plan-

ning and Budget Jim Hunter.
“Because we have no self-deﬁned
campus, people didn’t know when
they were entering it or leaving it.
The buildings had no uniﬁed form

of identification, and our many‘

visitors were justifiably confused.”

To remedy this problem, Chan-
cellor Wesley Posvar working
through the University’s Physical
Plant Department, asked three
design ﬁrms, two in Pittsburgh and
one in New York, to submit
proposals for a logo design to be
used for campus identification. The
New York firm, Raymond
Loewy/William Snaith, Inc. was
awarded a contract to design a logo
in February, 1971.

Loewy/Snaith spent the next two
years in researching the historical

-symbols of the city of Pittsburgh

and the University, and in talking
to members of these communities.
The firm’s final sketch consisted of
the circle enclosing a shield with

three smaller circles and bisected -

hmizontally by a band of checkers.
With the exception of the outer
circle, this logo is taken directly

from the coat-of-arms of William’

Pitt, the Earl of Chatham. The
shield’s design is similar to the seal
of _Chatham College, which has
used the Earl's shield as part of its
logo since 1871, and it also bears a
strong resemblance to the City of
Pittsburgh seal, which was origin-
ally drawn from William Pitt's
coat-of-arms.

This similarity, according to
Lowey/Snaith and Pitt representa-
tives, serves to emphasize the
interdependence of. the school and
the city, and their" common
heritage.

Lik_e all coats-of-arms, the ele-
ments on the shield are symbolic.
The three small circles represent
the city through the three rivers.
The horizontal band‘ of checkers
was included in the original Earl’s
seal to denote his position as the
British Chancellor of the Ex-

' chequer.

According to Director of News and ,

Publications Joseph Colangelo, the
old candle-within-the-shield logo
was “trite and simple" and

‘this was one of the reasons for the

change. The candle in the old logo
symbolized learning, the three dark
bars radiating from it the city and
its three rivers, and the design of
the shield included the date of the
University’s incorporation, the
Latin motto, “Veritas et Virtus,"
(Truth and Virtue) and the words
University of Pittsburgh.

Hunter agreed the original logo
was passe, but stressed the
University's need for a unified
symbol as being the main reason
for the change.

“With the size of this school and
the complexity of the various
departments and colleges, we had

' an incredible diversity of symbols,

without one symbol to uniformly
represent the University, that
everyone would accept,” said
Hunter. He admitted that various
University departments and organ-
izations will be restricted to using
the new logo, rather than their own
special symbols.

“That’s one of the problems we’re
running into, here,” said- Pitt
senior Graphic Designer. Jim
Hohman. “The various schools,
like General Studies and Engin-
eering feel they have to compete
when they're sitting on shelves in

high school guidance offices, so.

they’ve developed very modern,

individualistic bulletins. Now,
that’s all going to have to be

standardized. ’ ’

‘Design problems have also

become apparent when using the

new logo, according to Hohman.

The boldness of the outer circle.

makes the type “University of

Pittsburgh” incongruous, but
without the wording, no one
recognizes the symbol.

The News and Publications

department is presently in the
process of implementing the logo
so that it will fit onto everything
from beer mugs to invoices. A
special variation of the logo which
includes the battlements from the
Pittsburgh city’ seal and the slogan
and date is being designed for

blazer patches.

According to Hunter, $39,000 has
been spent on design of the logo
and installation of the signs, to
date. “The project will continue
and expand as more funds become
available,” he said. “Meanwhile
we are using up stocks of paper and
things with the old logo on them, so
there will be a gradual change with
little or no waste taking place.”

Hunter met complaints of a lack of
student involvement in the project
by saying,“You've got to remem-
ber we’ve got a shifting population
here. The people who were seniors
in 1971, and involved in the project
when it first got started, have all
graduated. now." ~

Current student reaction to the

Allegheny County Juvenile Court
is looking for volunteers to work in
the one to one Big Brother or Big
Sister friendship program. This fall
there is an urgent need for male
volunteers.

Huff sees the YMCA as one of the
major interfaces between the Uni-
versity and the community. “We
get many calls for help, many
requests’ and ideas for projects,

more than we can handle. The Pitt

YMCA is dedicated to making
students aware of the community
and human needs."

The Y offers job experience; a

chance to see if you really like ‘

working with kids, an opportunity,
to try your teaching ability or to see
if mental health is your field. ‘It
gives you a chance to try something

Individual Roles Stand Out ii

BY ED TOWNSEND
The Pittsburgh Opera opened its
1974-1975 season with the perfor-

mance of Verdi’s Otello. At the
opera's end, the curtain calls
,.continued, the “bravos"
"~resounded, and Pittsburgh’s

. socialites returned to their homes,
content to have spent a night at_the
opera. I would presume that the
cast of Otello did not.

The most blatant problem of the
production was the staging. As is
the case in most operas, moments
arise when the characters are ‘not
required to move for any particular
reason and must, therefore, appear
to be engaged in some relevant

task orjust stand there._ Curt Haug -
[stage director] had his characters"

doing such exciting things ‘as
pacing back and forth and,

jfﬁoccasiona
- . ' lly, walking cicles. The

:_ 4'only principle character able to

maintain interesting stage
presence was Thomas Tipton’s
Iago, whose every movement

added to the development of the
scene and his character. '

Haug did manage to create some
impressive scenic effects with the
use of projections on a large scrim
atthe back of the stage. These
abstract backdrops and the use of
minimal props seemed to clash,
however, with the somewhat
traditional and awkward staging of

be found anywhere in the city. All
of his songs (“Camelot,” “I
Wonder What the King is Doing

Arthur in spite of his fumbles and
foibles.

the chorus, who frequently found
themselves crowded onto plat-
forms, nearly always placed in
equal groups at symmetrical points
on the stage. _
Jean Cox portrayal of Otello was
disappointing. He seemed uneasy
with the‘ part and while musically
excellent, lacked the force and the
feeling for the character. In
contrast, Bozena Ruk-Focic as
Desdemona struck me as being too
forceful. She has a large, dramatic
voice, with excellent control of her
pianissimo high notes, (if not of her
vibrato) but did not portray the
innocent sweetness of Desdemona.
Grayson Hirst put‘ in a fine
performance as Cassio, who is a
rather static character in the opera,
but it was Thomas Tipton who
made the night. ‘He gave a
sensitive, credible portrayal of
Iago, through the use of excellent
stage motions and a rich, powerful
voice, which at times filled the hall,

i but never left his control. He was a

pleasure to hear and see.

Janet Kane, mezzo-soprano and
professor of vocal music at Pitt,
played Emilia, who is still alive and
rational to sum up the tragedy at its
close. She, too, left my ears
smiling, as did the Pittsburgh
Symphony Orchestra, which is to
be expected.

Richard Karp’s spirited conduct- .

ing was the determining factor that

‘kept the performance from being

merely mediocre. He has both
energy and sensitivity, and while
the opera suffered from some
miscasting and what can only be
called" boring staging, he was
responsible for conducting an
enjoyable and memorable, if.not
perfect performance. I'm looking
forward to “Daughter of the
Regiment" (November 7 and 9).

fortunate that she carried most of
the musical numbers. Her voice,
though very beautiful, does no
“justice to the Lerner and Lowe

have been more suitable.

Lerner and Lowe wrote lush,
lavish scores accompanied by
intelligent lyrics. As true for most
musicals, they are composed of a
flimsy script complemented by
such a score. But in every sense
Camelot is an exception. This
“hu’morless" musical provides a

abounding energy that leave an

played with innovative gimmicks
and devices added bouyance to the
play. If anything kept this play

WOMAN HATING
by Andrea Dworkin, 217 pp. New
York: Dutton $7.95.

“I want to slobber in your pussy."
A group of guys in a car pulled up
beside a friend of mine one night
recently as she was walking along
Fifth Avenue and one of them so
expressed himself. Incidents like
this are indicative of society's
perception of women primarily as
sexual objects. I

This attitude is expressed more
violently as rape. Andrea Medea, a
self-defense teacher, and Kathleen
Thompson, a member of Chicago
Women Against Rape have written
“a survival manual for women”
which tells “how to avoid en-
trapment and" how to cope with
rape physically and emotionally.”

Strong convictions and a wealth of
factual information combine to
make this concise book effective.
Against Rape destroys myths as it
analyzes rapists and the society
whose philosophy encourages
It also provides detailed
advice. on self defense and other
measures to prevent rape.

What is rape? The authors write

.that “Rape is a crime against
_women.

Rape is a‘ deadly insult
against you as a person. Rape is
the deprivation of sexual self-
determination. Rape is a man's
fantasy, a woman’s nightmare.
Rape is all the hatred, contempt,
and oppression of women in this
society."

Against Rape’s description of the‘

average rapist is bound to surprise
many who picture him as a sick
deviant. “The rapist is the man
next door,” the authors_ write.
There is a better than 50% probab-
ility the victim will know her
attacker and there’s a better than
50% chance that the rapist “will
behave calmly and matter-of-factly.
-“A recent study showed that
indistin-
guishable from ordinary men in
psychological tests."

Only one study cited in Against
Rape found that 82.1% of rapes

were premeditated. Rape is also a .

tactic used in warfare.

E‘
+ .:

Rapists are the products “of a
certain kind of male conditioning.”
Medea and Thompson find most
rapists fall into two categories: the
“ultra-masculine” man who is"_
“aggressive, hard, and pushy” ‘
and the man who sees sex as
something he has to buy. For the
second type of rapist, rape is
getting something for nothing. The

‘authors write that most men have

these traits to some extent--the
rapist really can be the ordinary
man.

111 addition to myths about the
rapist there are myths about the
victim. One myth is that she is
asking for it and enjoys it. (Such a
view was presented in Sam Peckin-
pah's Straw Dogs). On the other
hand if the victim is one’s wife or
sister, one fears that she'll be
driven insane by the attack of a
lunatic.

Medea and Thompson use exan1—
ples and studies to demolish these
myths. The rape victim generally

'5 "”"§ociety is inclined to think of the

"best method of self-defense. They
brieﬂy outline some essentials and
a basic course of action for the rape
victim to follow. '

Laws which treat women as
property make it difficult for rape
victims to see their assailants
convicted. The sexist rape laws
only cover penetration. This view
of sexuality and the value of women
is insulting and degrading. What
is needed are;laws “in which an
attack upon a woman, any attack,
would be treated seriously."

As Bobbie Kestner ofthe local

' Rape Crisis Center said in a recent

“Our

victim as being somehow at fault...
it's always seemed that in a
courtroom the woman has not only
to prove her own innocence but the
man‘s guilt. She’s asked if she was
wearing provacative clothing and
things like that."

In a survey of 60 victims, 70%

_ \’didn’t report the rape. When the
 <i3ape was reported, 33% of the

rapists were apprehended and 50%
of them were convicted. Sixty
rapes and only three convictions--
only one on a charge of rape.
“Rape is not the isolated act of an
aberrant individual but a crime
against women that is encouraged
by a sexist society; that women are

seen, in our culture, not as whole‘
_ human beings, but as objects and

{'3

authorized victims of male aggres-
sion.”

Very few people will probably
read Andrea Dworkin’s Woman
vHating. It's been out for a few

months and it hasn’t gotten many
reviews. I think that's a shame.

Woman Hating is radical, original,
and provocative. Dworkin finds
that a society's sexism links such
diverse items as Chinese footbind-
ing and the story of Cinderella.

, Woman Hating, like Kate

Millett's Sexual Politics uses ex-
amples from literature and history
to support feminist views. Dwor-

f-rjlkin writes, 5‘__This book is an

revolution is the goal...It is not
cerebral wisdom. or academic
horseshit, or ideas carved in gran-
ite or destined for immortality.”
Dworkin’s examples of woman
hating from literature include fairy
tales and pornography. We have
not created the world of fairy
tales--“it has formed us. We
ingested it as children whole, had
its values and consciousness im-
printed on our minds as cultural
absolutes long before we were in
fact men and women. We have
taken the fairy tales of childhood

, ith us into maturity, chewed but

still lying in the stomach, as real
identity.” A

Gretel, and Rapunzel. Two images
of woman are presented--she is
either good, beautiful and passive,
or evil, cruel and devouring, Both
are destroyed--one as victim, one in
retribution. Fairy talesltell us
“happiness for a woman is to be
passive, victimized, destroyed or
asleep."

Fairy tales “delineate the roles,
interactions and values” of society
for children. Pornography also
contains society's definition of
male and female roles. Dworkin
deals with The Story of 0. The
Image and Suck magazine.
posedly contributing to sexual
liberation and revealing woman’s
true nature, theseworks catalogue
sexist fantasies “through the pro-
jection of archetypal sado-
masochistic images.” I

Woman Hating takes two exam-
ples of genocide from “herstory,
the underbelly of history” to
provide the historical correlation

Sup-V

for fairy tales and pornography.
Before you read Woman Hating, I
doubt that you will have heard of
the Chinese practice of footbind-
ing. After reading this book, you
won't forget this outrageous proce-
dure which crippled millions of
women over a period of 10 centur-
ies. Binding the foot so that it was

' only three or four inches long was

painful and debilitating. It served

to reinforce society’s view of
women as sex objects and
breeders. “Millions of mothers,

over a period of .1,000 years,
brutally crippled and mutilated
their daughters for'the sake of a
secure marriage" and “-in the
name of beauty.”

The idolization of the bound foot is
horrifying in itself but Woman
Hating successfully ties it to
modern instances reflecting the
same philosophy’. In current
society “judging women according
to their conformity to a standard of

beauty serves to make them into
products, chattels, differing from
the farmer’s favorite cow only in
terms of literal form." The crucial
issue to Dworkin though, is that
standards of beauty define the
relationship a woman will have to
her body--the guidelines on mobil-
ity, posture, etc. serve to define the
limits of women's personal free-
dom. As in footbinding pain is
essential to the beautifying pro-
cess. Masochism is encouraged in
creating a self-ima-ge based on
self-mutilation. 1

The persecution of witches is

.Dworkin’s other" historical exam-

ple. In 300 years nearly nine
million people, mostly women,
were slaughtered. The myth of
feminine evil, prevalentin the past
and present influenced historical
misrepresentations of witches.

What does Dworkin want? She
wants to “destroy...polar role de-
finitions of male and female...We
want to destroy patriarchal power
at its source, the family...We want
to...destroy all of the images,
institutions, and structural mental
sets which define women as hot_wet
fuck tubes, hot slits."

For Dworkin, androgyny is the

solution. As in the rest of the book,

underrated passing of quarterback

Hapless Chiefs Hand
Steelers Third Win

BY JOHN C. BLACKBURN

The Kansas City’ Chiefs found
their missing-and-feared-dead of-
fense against the Steelers yester-
day at Arrowhead Stadium. but
they paid a stiff price.

Abandoning their conservatism,
the Chiefs’ high-risk offense netted
over 250 yards for the first time in
four games, but turned the ball
over a staggering nine times to set

up Pittsburgh’s 34-24 victory.

The game turned around in a
nine-minute span following a ﬁeld
goal attempt by Roy Gerela early in
the second quarter. The Chief's
lead of 10-7 held up as Gerela’s
kick sailed wide left.

Quarterback Mike Livingston’s
first-down pass was a perfect strike
to Steeler rookie linebacker Jack
Lambert, with no Chiefs anywhere
near him. He returned to the KC
25,_,and four plays later Preston
Pearson scored on an end sweep
from the three to put Pittsburgh
up, 14-10.

Kansas City recorded two first
downs on its next possession before
Livingston, on third-and-seven
near midfield, tried to hit ex-
Steeler Barry Pearson across the
middle. Glen Edwards knifed in
front of Pearson to intercept, and
ran 52 yards to score.

 

Len Dawson replaced Livingston
at quarterback on the Chiefs’ next
series, and Jack Ham intercepted
Dawson's first pass of the game on
a deflection at the KC 33.

Joe Gilliam recovered from a
12-yard loss on a sack by Marvin
Upshaw and hit Lynn Swann down
the middle for 23 yards and a first
down. That set up Gerela's 32-yard
FG that put the Steelers.on top
24-10, with 2:19 left in the half.

Dawson’s outing was-not one of
his best: he completed one of four
passes with one intercepted, and
either of the two incompletions
could easily have been picked off
also. His lone completion was to
running back Jeff Kinney for an
eight-yard loss.

Having been intercepted three
times, and sacked twice for 35
yards in losses, Livingston was
probably reluctant to return in the
second half. But he rallied the
Chiefs slightly, only to see them
continue to kill themselves with
mistakes when a comeback seemed
possible.

Livingston’s 48-yard completion
to Pearson, who was left all by
himself down the right sideline, set

up a nine-yard TD toss to Otis
Taylor which closed the gap to
24-17 on KC's first series of the

goal kicking of sophomore Carson
Long once again accounted for the
winning score as he boomed a
45-yard kick which put Pitt in front
17-14.

But Pitt didn’t come by the victory
without a fight from the Mountain-
eers. West Virginia led at the half
14-7 as the Panthers made several
blunders which perpetuated WVU
drives. ‘ .

In the first quarter, West Virginia
controlled the ball in Pitt territory
against a stingy Pitt defense. On
second and six, fullback Heywood
Smith was stopped for no gain on
the Pitt 33, but a personal foul
against Pitt's Arnie Weathering-
ton, who threw several punches at
a WVU player, cost the Panthers
fifteen yards and Weatherington’s
services for the rest of the after-
noon. Several plays later Smith
plunged into the endzone from two
yards out. .

Pitt came right back to drive 77
yards for the equalizer. Tony
Dorsett did most of the work with
some help for Daniels as they
picked their way through the WVU

Several penalties to the Mounties
greatly assisted the effort, and
Billy Daniels finally put the ball in
the endzone on a sneak to the left
after he set the defense up with two

Rockets Remain Undefeated

Pitt Boaters Tie   Rockets

BY ANDY BEHREND
Pitt's soccer Panthers blotted
Slippery Rock's undefeated, untied
season by deadlocking the Rockets,
0-0, Saturday before several

‘ hundred rabid ‘Rock rooters.

The Panthers showed from the
outset they were not intimidated by
their more publicized rivals.
The offensive line of John Wallace,
John Morahan and Bill Rex on left
and right wings respectively, and
John Curley at the trailer position
combined for a number of
infiltrations in Rocket territory,
only to come up empty-handed.

Meanwhile, Pitt’s defense, solidi-
fying more each game, contributed
its finest effort of the now
half-completed season. '

Fullbacks Stan Sbei and Ernie
Gross, anchored by Mark Venanzi

Ferguson '3

and, Jerry Luxacher in the middle,
bottled up Slipper Rock’s high
scoring attack line. So dominant
was Pitt’s defense that Art Rex, the
Rocket’s all-time goal scorer in one
season with 26 coming into the Pitt
fracas, was only able to take one
hard shot on goal, which Frank

-Bucci saved neatly on his way to

earning his second shutout’.

Coach Jim Egli, the Rocket’s
veteran mentor heaped high praise
on the Panthers.

“Pitt was easily the best team
we’ve faced all year,”Egli said-
That is certainly not hard to
believe, considering mu__ch of
Slippery Rock’s success has come
against weak calibre of clubs,

LOS ANGELES AP- Joe Fergus-

and relief ace Mike Marshall came
out of the bull-pen to nail down Don
Sutton’s victory as the Los Angeles
Dodgers edged the Oakland A’s 3-2
in Sunday's second game of the

1974 World Series.
The result tied the best of seven
battles for baseball’s world cham-
pionship at one victory each

 

with Game 3 scheduled for Tuesday
night in Oakland.

Sutton dazzled the A’s on two hits
through the ﬁrst seven innings,
then squirmed out of a one out,
bases loaded jam in the eighth
before Marshall took over in the
ninth.

team having the edge Saturday.
“The tie reﬂects the evenness of
the game,” he said, pointing out
his team had the same amount of
chances as Pitt.

Pitt boss Leo Bemis had to feel a
small twinge of disappointment at
his second straight tie (Edinboro

, was tied earlier in the season, 1-1)

to a Division I team in the West
Penn Conference.

The tie virtually assures Pitt little
chance to win the West Penn

crown. Slippery Rock, on the other '

hand, is in good shape after the tie.
Since they play far more games
within the Division, their point total
will easily out-distance Pitt’s. A
Pitt victory would have thrown all
points away, however.

The match was one of Pitt’s more
physical battles, but there were no
serious injuries suffered.

Special mention must go to the
referees, especially Bud Roman,
who did an outstanding job on this
afternoon of keeping the game in
hand, a game in which tempers
ﬂared often, partially due to the
“hard-ass” syndrome which
encompasses the Slippery Rock
players. It is a disease which
drives players to hack at legs when
they are beaten and flail with

elbows when going to the ball wit A M

the Panthers started a drive which
enabled them to tie the game at
14-14. Once again it was Dorsett
and Daniels who made the ground
game effective. Two clutch passes,
one to Jim Corbett for twelve yards
and one to Karl Farmer for 19
more, moved the Panthers within
striking range. at the WVU 36.

Dorsett then carried twice for 12
yards and Daniels added six on a
bootleg. Dorsett fumbled on the
next play but recovered his fumble
for a one yard gain. Bruce Murphy

followed with four more yards for a
big first down on third and three.
It was all Dorsett from there as he
covered the final 13 yards on four
plays vaulting into the endzone for
the touchdown from one yard out.
Long's kick deadlocked the score.
West Virginia completely fell
apart in the fourth quarter and the
Panthers could do nothing wrong.

But when the aroused Chiefs
forced Pittsburgh to punt from its
own territory moments later, they
were detected holding on the kick,
and the Steelers maintained
possession. Frank Lewis beat

next play to help setup Gere1a's

Rookie Larry Brunson fumbled the

down strike to Frank Lewis, who

vicious hit by Reardon on the
Steelers’ next possession, but

Pittsburgh got it right back when
blitzing Andy Russell chased
Livingston '23 yards the wrong way
and virtually stole the ball from him
at the Chiefs’ 34.

Pittsburgh negotiated the 34
yards in six plays, the big one a
20-yard flare from Gilliam to Bleier
for a first down at the 13. Preston
Pearson gained 11 behind ﬁne
blocking on two plays, setting up
Bleier’s first career TD on a
two-yard sweep. Gerela's conver-
 made it 7-3.

Late in the first quarter, Kansas
City took over at the Steeler 48
following a fine punt return by
Brunson. An 18-yard Livingston-
to-Taylor pass carried for a first
down at the 31, but the drive
appeared over when Mike Wagner
intercepted Livingston’s third-
down heave at the five.

But Dwight “Mad Dog" White,
who followed KC quarterbacks
everywhere but into their huddles,.
was guilty of roughing the passer,
and the drive stayed alive. ‘On the

~ very next play. which opened the

second quarter, Barry Pearson beat
J.T. Thomas for a 13-yard score.
Kansas City led. 10-7, and the
stage was set for the Chiefs’
comedy of errors.

Pitt got the ball one more time
after WVU attempted to get the
first down on fourth and three from
their own 36. Fiorante's pass to
tight end Randy Swinson fell
incomplete and the Pitt offense
trotted back onto the field.

The Panthers didn't just try to kill
the clock, however. They moved
right through the opposing
defense, the big play being a 15
yard burst through the middle by
Dorsett which he followed with an
eight yard gain bringing his total
for the day to 145 yards on 38
carries. The touchdown came four
plays later when Daniels completed
a 10-yard strike to Todd Toerper.

“I would have liked to have rested
our veterans earlier, but I didn’t
feel safe with a ten point lead,”
said Majors in response to charges
that he may have been running up
the score. “A fumble could turn
the game around at that point.”

Pitt's next game will be against
the Boston . College Eagles who
have won big in their past two
games to bring their record to 2-2.
But if history repeats itself; the
Panthers are due to start a winning
streak with the Eagles as their next
victim.

BY CONNIE GIEL

A} T Only yesterday Coach Marc
.,.Boileau mused, “I'd like to see the
I defensive players move the puck a
little more and the forwards to
.think more defensively.” Boileau
noted, “The Penguins have no real
Ivveaknesses, but it would be nice to
see‘ a few changes in style.”

And nice it was as the Penguins
(flew all over the Detroit Red Wings
Saturday night on a goal scoring
spree ended only by the final
buzzer and not, predictably, by the
Red Wing defense. No less than
seven Penguins, forwards and
odefensemen, found the net to make
.'the home opener 7-2 before a
'i:ecord first night crowd of 11,909
fans at the Civic Arena.

Friday morning’s practice drills
paid off as the Pens aggressively
fore-checked (the first time in a
 _ long time) and skated in what may
become classic positional patterns.

“Page l4:THE PITT NEWS—Monday, October 14, 1974

 Pens Destroy Detroit In Home Opener

Boileau explained his shooting
philosophy thusly: “You can’t
score behind the net. A lot of the
guys would be coming down on the
net and then ﬁnd themselves in- too
close to get a shot off. So lmade
them skate in, stop in front of the
net---always keeping in the slot---
and then shoot. I made everybody
do it, and it works.”

No one would dispute its
effectiveness after watching Rick
Kehoe knock in Ab DeMarco’s pass
from the point early in the second
period, following several such
picture-perfect that somehow
didn’t ﬁnd the net in the first
period. Ex-Penguin Jim Ruther-
ford, in goal for Detroit, had less to
do with it than luck as several
shots, including a blistering one
by right wing Chuck Arnason and a
neat backhander by Kelly Pratt,
were right on goal only to sail wide
or up over the glass.

Detroit's Danny Grant made good
on a power play as Dennis Owchar,
up from Hershey along with rookie
Colin Campbell to sub for injured
defensemen Jean Guy Lagace and
Dave Burrows, served a minor for
tripping. Grant's tying goal was
short-lived, however, for /in the
minutes to come defenseman Al
DeMarco scored on Owchar’s pass
from center Syl Apps, who helped
make it 3-1 seven minutes later
with his assist to linemates Lowell
MacDonald and Jean Pronovost.

Pronovost’s goal was scored
against Jim Rutherford, who left
the game midway in'the second
period after taking a shot by Bob
Paradise high on his neck.

Rutherford finished the period but
back-up goalie Terry Richardson
stood in the nets for the third.

Pesky ex-Penguin Brian Watson
chased after rookies Campbell and
Larouche throughout the game,
picking up a slashing penalty at
7:52 and a tripping penalty at 10:30
in the second period. He mixed it
up a bit with former teammate
Lowell MacDonald in the third, and
both received coincidentals for
slashing at 8:07.

Apps opened the third period at

'2:00 with his third goal of the

season. But Detroit’s Red Beren-
son moved in on the Pens’ goalie
Gary Inness to score only 19
seconds later with an assist from

ex-Penguin Hank Nowak. Former
Red Wing Nelson Debenedet,

‘ traded to Pittsburgh for Nowak and

3rd round draft pick, scored on his
second try at 10:42 to make it 5-2.

Captain Ron Schock came roaring
down on Richardson to salt away
goal number six for the Penguins,
followed by Battleship Kelly’s final
one. Kelly picked up Pierre
Larouche’s shot from the face-off
circle for his second goal of the
season.

As Boileau said, “I don't believe -./“\
in superstars. We skate and win asN\"’\-T
a team.” After last night’s game
many will be inclined to believe‘
him.

Dodgers Even Series

(Continued from Page 12)

-Dodger Manager Walter Alston

called for Marshall, who appeared
in a record 106 games during the
regular season.

Joe Rudi tagged Marshall for a
single to center that delivered both
Bando and Jackson and made the
score 3-2. Now the A’s had the
tying run on ﬁrst base but it didn’t
stay there long.

Marshall struck out Gene Tenace

and then A’s Manager Alvin Dark -

went to his pinch running specialist
Herb Washington.

Marshall threw one pitch to pinch
hitter Angel Mangual as Washing-
ton inched off first base.

Suddenly, Marshall whipped a
pickoff throw. Washington was
leaning the wrong way and dived
back to the base head first, but he
was too late as first baseman
Garvey slapped the tag on.

That left Mangual as the A’s last
hope and Marshall disposed of him
quickly on a swinging third strike
that ended the ballgame. It was
Oakland’s 11th str-ikeout of the

winning streak followed a mid-year
slump that had both Sutton and the
Dodgers baffled.

The people puzzled Sunday were

He squirmed out of his first jam of

(iron-man performance from any
goalie at the start of avseason.

Time is bound to catch up with the
aging Hawk stars sooner or later.
There is still no way Chicago can be
ousted from the top of this division,
but when April rolls around. Stan
Mikita (30-50), Jim Pappin (32-41)
and defenseman Bill White won't
be the young legs a team needs in
the ever-crucial playoffs.

Reay received a gift from Charley

Seals for aminor leauger and part
time defenseman Len Frig. Bold-

Mikita and Pit Martin (30-47).

Dale Tallon, acquired last year
from Vancouver, was shifted from
the blue line to center ice by Reay
but with Bolderiv around he could
move back to his original position.
Tallon was hampered by nagging
injuries all last year and could
manage only 15 goals and 34
points. ‘

Dennis Hull dropped to his worst
pro performance last season, scor-
ing 29 goals, 10 off his ’72-'73
marks. Cliff Koroll and Darcy Rota
were the only other marksmenlto
bre.-.i< 20 goals, with 21 apiece.
Rota was the Hawks’ number one

draft choice going into last season
and displayed potential. working
well with Martin and Pappin.

Besides White, Keith Magnuson,
Doug Jarrett and Phil Russel will
return as the defense that helped
Esposito share the Vezina. Reay
has depth all through the bench,
although most of his other forwards
aren't known for their overwhelm-
ing ability to put the puck in the
net. '

Backup goalie Mike Veisor, who
posted a 2.23 average in just 10
games, will have to be used to spell
Esposito more often and Reay will
have to rest his stars at intervals
over the campaign if his plans are
to advance past the semifinals of
the Cup playoffs.

The Minnesota North Stars should
rebound off a year in which turmoil
tore the club apart. Jack Gordon
was fired as coach just six weeks
into the 1973-74 season but is right
back behind the bench now and has
been given the general managers
position to boot, replacing the man
that fired him, Wren Blair.

When Gordon departed, many of
thelNorth Stars claimed new coach
Parker MacDonald could not main-
tain discipline, motivate his team to
win or draw out the potential talent

In Smylhe Division

Stars, Blues Battle for 2nd Place

(Continued from Page 15)

where a businessman has no
business. The situation in St. Louis
is similar of days not long_ago in
Pittsburgh.

The Blues’ coach Lou Angotti has
but a few established stars with
which to work. It was “the new
player of the week” all last season,
with trades being made rampantly
by the Solomons and farm teams

K being milked regularly.

Gary Unger (33-35) led the Blues
in scoring last year and should
repeat this year, barring all in-
juries. There just isn’t- anybody
else to put the puck in the net with
much regularity.

Pierre Plante tallied 26 times as a
rookie but the third leading goal
scorer. Greg Polis was dealt to the
New York Rangers for Larry Sach-
urak. K

On defense, former Bruin Don
Awrey, captain Barclay Plager,
brother Bob Plager, Larry Girous
and Bob Gassoff represent a rug-
ged crew that will run at anybody.

John Davidson (3.08) is the
brightest spot of St. Louis’ future
after turning in a fair rookie season

. ofgoaltending. Wayne Stephenson

(3.09) wasn't far behind and E.J.
Johnston was acquired from Tor-
onto to spread some experience
around.

It's between the Blues and the
Stars to see who can get their team
together after a season of turmoil

owl S
COLUMBUS
DA

and dissension. I'll take the Stars.

Vancouver coach Phil Maloney
was quoted at the start of last
season, “We need help every-
where.” But the new allignment
has put the Canucks behind Minn-
esota, which only had one more
victory than Vancouver, and St.
Louis, which only totaled five more
points. And if Maloney can
overtake just one of them, the
Canucks are in the “playoffs” for
their first time ever.

Maloney's main problem is that

he did not have one 30 goal scorer

last year. The other is that his
defense, with the exception of Josh

Guevremont, is made up of bulky,‘

bruising bad boys that lack speed
and finesse.

Kansas City got the best of
Washington in the expansion draft,
copping the two best goalies avail-
able in Pete McD_uffe and Michel
Plasse. Toss in Simon Nolet, Gary
