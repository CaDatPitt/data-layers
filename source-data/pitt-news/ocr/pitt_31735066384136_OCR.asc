PITTSBURGH (AP)--Incumbent
Richard Caliguiri, an independent
who broke away from the Demo-
cratic party much like Pete Flaherty
did eight years ago, won this city’s
mayoral race yesterday.

They boyish-looking Caliguiri
held a 5,000 vote lead over
Democratic stalwart Thomas Foer-
ster with '98 percent of the votes
counted. _

With 405 of 412 precincts
reporting, Caliguiri had 66,677

V votes, or 47 percent, while Foerster
had 62,065, or 44 percent.

‘ ‘At long last we will not be active
or interim,” said Caliguiri at his
victory speech, which was attended
by Flaherty.

“I hope that we can all come
together, including Tom and Joe,
and really show what Pittsburgh can
be,” he said referring to Foerster
and Republican Joe Cosetti.

Foerster conceded defeat, but
said he had no hard feelings toward

Pitt Task Force to Bus

classes Tuesday or give leaves of
absence, the task force will attempt
to delay exams so students will not
be penalized by attending the rally.

The rally will be held on the
Capitol steps at 12:30 p.m., and is
expected to last until 2:30 p.m.
Buses, funded by the Student
Government through the student
activities fee, will leave the Bigelow
side of the Student Union at
approximately 7:30 a.m., and will
return at about 7 p.m. Tuesday
night.

The task force is also is planning
meetings with several members of
the State Senate to lobby for Pitt's
appropriations, at the same time as
the rally. “We plan to approach the
senators armed with their voting
records, and present a reasonable
case,” said McCauley. “We want
them to know it may not be an
election year, but that students will
make it their business to find out
who is running against them in the
next election.”

To generate interest in the rally,
the task force is attempting to get

“we’re all in this together.”

The Chancellor said Pitt person-

A Non-Profit /Tax-Exempt) Urganization

By TOBI ROSEN
Pin News Staff Writer

In the political silence of the
1970’s, civil and political activist
Stokely Carmichael is still calling
for a revolution to destroy
American capitalism.

“The enemy is capitalism and it
must be fought without mercy,”
Carmichael told an overﬂow
Student Union crowd Monday in a
speech that kicked off Pitt’s Black
Week activities. “No African in his
right mind could support the
system. He either works for the
CIA or he’s crazy.”

Carmichael warned of capi-
talism’s “con game” that, he said,
tricks people into believing they
can think freely.

“You are all in the system and, if
you're not aware of it, then you are
really in it,” he said.

Carmichael, a founder of the
national Student Non-Violent Co-
ordinating Committee, said capi-
talism’s “poison” has seeped into
universities where, he claimed, an
estimated 80 percent of students
cheat.

_“If you get an ‘A’ and all the
others get an ‘F’, you’re happy.
The system makes you like
animals,” he said. “It is the
responsibility of the strong to help
the weak become strong.”

He explained a university stu-
dent who earns his degree to
“exploit labor is worse than the
brother who stands on the corners
and snatches a purse.” '

Carmichael cited education as a

prerequisite to revolution and
urged student to ﬁght injustice.

“I’m not only talking about black
power, he said, adding that his
motivating force is
humanity.”

As an organizer of the All
Afrikan People’s Revolutionary
Party, Carmichael points to “Pan
Africanism” to unite Africans
throughout the world. “Once
Africa is free, American capitalism
will come tumbling down,” he
said.

He also sharply criticized inter-
national corporations including
some Pittsburgh-based banks.

“You put money in the bank, and .
they in turn invest it in the sweat of
South Africa. They keep the proﬁts
and give you chump change,” he
said.

Carmichael advocates scientiﬁc
socialism that places corporate

ownership and production unéf’ 

worker control.

This solution, he said, radically
changes motivation from personal
greed to “service to humanity.”

Pitt Salaries
Below Norm,
Report Says

Pitt faculty salaries have failed to
keep pace with those of other
colleges and universities in the past
two years, according to a rep, 
presented at a recent meeting of the
local chapter of the American
Association of University Profes-
sors (AAUP).

University administrators have
questioned the accuracy of the
report, presented by economics and
ﬁnance professor Jacob Cohen, and
indicated they would check the data
they supplied for the research.

In his report, Cohen said Pitt’s
ranking among colleges and
universities fell from 87th in 1975-76
to 128th in 1976-77 when comparing
salaries, and from 128th to 305th if
fringe beneﬁts were taken into
account.

Some of the report’s 
he

incorrect because of changes in t
University's computer system,
according to Marilyn Brown of Pitt’s
institutional research division.

By adding adjunct professors and
lab instructors to the instructor
catergory, salary averages drop-
ped, Brown said.

Certain fringe beneﬁts were also
omitted, she said, including tuition
remission for the children of faculty
and unemployment compensation.

Cohen’s analysis was based on

the annual survey of the “Eco.<!.{A ' ' 

Status of the Profession.”
survey is prepared by the national
ofﬁce of the AAUP from data
supplied by universities to the
National Center for Educational
Statistics of the U.S. Department of
Health, Education and Welfare
(HEW).

Pitt administrators said AAUP
usually collectes its own data.
Eecause HEW’s data requirements
may be different, Pitt claimed an
inaccurate report could result.

“Not only is the report apd
supplementary data gloomy for Fa}
at this time, but the uncertain
budgetary situation is cause for
pessimism,” Cohen said in his
report.

No new strategy

Pill News Staff Writer _

Eighteen weeks into its ﬁscal year
and nine weeks into its school year,
Pitt is without state money, and
University officials deny the time
has come for a new, more active
strategy to end the appropriations
impasse.

Despite a “Statement of Common
Concern” that appeared in every
major Pennsylvania newspaper last

‘ teek, and plans to mail letters

 

asking for help to more then 69,000
Pitt alumni living in the state.
University leaders claim no new
battle plan is in the works.
“It represents one element of
many (strategies) we are trying, to
bring a swift resolution to the
current budget crisis,” said Edward
Bozik, executive assistant to the
Chancellor. “It represents an
additional tactic we are introducing
to show the Legislature not only the
universities are concerned. There is
concern among all elements in the
commonwealth to bring a swift
resolution to the problem.”
: The statement of concern, which

ppeared in newspapers last

Thursday, urged the legislators to
ﬁnd an immediate solution to the
funding dilemma.

“Pennsylvania’s colleges and
universities are vital to our welfare.
They educate our young people,”
the statement said. “They renew
the skills amid perspectives of our
citizens.

“They develop new knowledge.
They preserve our culture. They

improve our health and our daily
lives. And they contribute to our
economic well-being.

“ 72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

The Last Straw

An editorial in yesterday’s Pittsburgh Press noted 22 state
legislators are planning a December trip to the Virgin Islands,
ostensibly to confer with legislators from other states on mutual
problems. The tab for the five-day junket will run around $18,000.

“It’s enough to make Pennsylvania taxpayers sick,” The Press
said, and we couldn’t agree more. The legislators are not. likely to
have Pitt appropriations on their minds’ as they soak up the
poolside sun in St. Thomas.

This junket is the last straw. Pitt students finally will get the
chance to collectively voice their displeasure" about this and about
the budget crisis in general Tuesday at a statewide student rally in
Harrisburg.

The Student Government Board’s Task Force on Higher
Education has requested that students be allowed to miss classes
without penalty in order to encourage maximum participation in
the rally. Representatives from Penn State, Temple and Lincoln
also will be present. Delegates will meet with legislators while the
bulk of students demonstrate outside the capital.

If the administration approves “official leaves of absence” for
Tuesday's rally in Harrisburg, students will have at least one more
chance to make an impression on those legislators before they take
off.

The seriousness of the budget crisis is demonstrated by the task
force’s appeal for a show of unity in Harrisburg. The impact made
by the delegates who actually see the legislators will be multiplied
considerably if a visible mass of students is present to-back them
up. It would surely be in the best interests of the University for the
administration to approve the task force's request for “official
leaves of absence.”

‘ Of course, task force efforts will mean nothing if students
continue to ignore the situation in Harrisburg. Unless a large
number at stiidédﬁts board those SOB buses Tuesday morning, the
effect of student lobbyists will remain nil. We hope students will
wake up to the need for action before interest payments on
University loans show up in next term’s tuition invoices.

Letters To The Editor

Rev. Domic Claims Bias Ignored

This is my answer to your articles
pertaining to my resignation as
instructor in the slavic department
in protest over discrimination
against Slavic Americans.

In general, both articles indicate
to me how poisonous and contag-
ious Pitt's atmosphere could be on
students; and believe me that
aspect was the main factor'in my
resignation. The only way the
schools could mold honest, sincere
and uncorruptible generations is by
being honest, sincere and uncor-
ruptible themselves. Unless we

search for truth, we are corrupt.

When you published excerpts
from the Gibian-Mathewson report
and omitted the key paragraph,
which attacks Slavs in general and

calls them ‘ ‘emigre.’ ’ Ifelt Pe1'h3P5
you had little intelligence to
understand academic “evalua-
tion.”

However, Tom Kukucka’s Oct-
ober 31 article: “Slavic Head
Denies Department Bias” cured
me of my doubts and I realized that
not only Pitt’s administration, but
also the students at The Pitt News,
could manipulate public opinion
and communication, and could
cover up illegal, immoral and
unethical acts. I happen to know
that material on the reaction of
Slavic professors to the Gibian-
Mathewson report was obtained by
The Pitt News, and that all of them
condemned the report as biased.
Your reporter also interviewed

people at the slavic languages
department who expressed ‘their
anti-Gibian-Mathewson feelin _ '
Why was this suppressed?

The article quotes Wasyl
Jaszczun as supporting the present
chairman Jane Harris, as “best
qualiﬁed.” Deliberate omission
was made, by your paper or your
reporter, when you left out the
information Harris was hired
without any administrative experi-
ence, had no scholarly publication,
and had only one year teaching
experience at the University of
Indiana.

Rev. Ivan Dornic

‘A Relationship Is A Relationship, Regardless Of Gender Involved’

I would like to respond to the’

letter authored by the “Reverend”
Shope (Pitt News, Nov. 7) to him as
”the reverend” simply because he
does nothing throughout the letter
but preach.

What has given you the right,
Rev. Shope, to judge others for their
actions? What you are doing, in
reality, is accepting “The good
book”as the ultimate truth. This is
ﬁne if you believe in Christianity,
Reverend. However, what proof do
you have there is such a thing as
“God,” or that the Bible is the
ultimate truth? Your letter states
“A superior law charges that
homosexuality is an abomination,
i.e. a moral sin.” Then you go on to
quote Leviticus from the Bible. Big
deal!

The Bible was penned by men,
Rev. Shope, and men make
judgements. Apparently back then,
these men chose to condemn other
men for doing something that was
none of the eondemner’s business.

“Such acts of homosexuality are

unnatural” you say. From a
biological standpoint, I cannot
argue.

It is true that a homosexual act
produces no offspring. But in
making such a statement, you lump
man and all other animals in the
same category. But man is a little
different (not because anything in
the Bible says so, but because he
has a superior intelligence evi-
denced by what he has accom-
plished, compared to any other
animal). Man also is inﬂuenced
greatly by his environment. In most
cases, it was homelife and
psychological factors in the homo-
sexual’s background that caused
this unfortnate change. I guess that
even though both partners enjoy it
and ﬁnd it satisfying, a “deviate”
sexual act is a“sin” because they
are not “doing it right.” The whole:
purpose of the act, according to
Rev. Shope, is to impregnate the
female.

What about contraceptives, Rev.
Shope? Are they not a sin? Do they
not interfere with the “intended
purpose” fo sexual intercourse?

Did you ever stop the think, Rev.
Shope, that in a homosexual
relationship, sex is just a small part
of the relationship, just a means to
show affection and love for the
partner, exactly as in a heterosexual
relationship? Granted, there are
one-night stands, ﬂings, and gay
bars, but does not the hetersosexual
society have analogous situations?
What about pickups at dances,
singles’ bars and sexual relation-
ships lacking love? A relationship is
a relationship, regardless of the sex
of the persons involved.

The thing that enrages me most
about your way of thinking,
Reverend, is that you threaten
homosexuals with a terrible pun-
ishment if they don’t repent. (“In
the end they will have to pay for
their sins. ..unless they amend their
ways.”) Do you know what this
punishment is? Have you ever seen
proof of it? Were your “reborn?” If
so, now do you know . your
“experience’ ’ wasn’t temporary
insanity? What about the other
religions existing on the" earth? If
you choose to live by “God’s
rules’ ‘(i.e. the Bible) just go ahead.
I won’t condemn you. You can
choose to thinkin the way you desire
as long as you don’t hurt other
people. But who do you think you
are when you try to push your
personal values on other people?
By threatening a homosexual, as
you have done, you merely add- to
the guilt the person already feels.
Guilt that you and society inflicted
in the first place. -

biological instincts? Chances are, it
would make his life harder.

I’d just like to say, in closing,
that I'm glad you don’t run the
country, Mr. Shope. I’d be a
Christian, whether I wanted to or
not, and I'd have to follow the Bible
to the letter. It’s a free country, and
before you pull out a quote and

threaten a punishment you better
prove it. I want to add that I am a
heterosexual, but biased people like
Mr. Shope and Anita Bryant make
me sick. Unfortunately, I am forced
to withhold my name, as there are
many people around who would
immediately heap abuse upon me,
as any person who ever took the
“Wrong” side of a controversial
issue will testify to.
Name Withheld By Request

‘Not The Almighty’s Businessﬁe

God may not have intended for
man to lie with man, but it’s really
none of the Almighty’s business.
Also, Mr. Shope, it is none of your
business. Mr. Romberg is right in
pointing out in the same issue that
even such disgusting creatures as
homosexuals deserve their consti-
tutional rights. (Careful, Mr.
Romberg! Some people said that
about blacks in the 1950's and look
what happened.)

There is a right more and more
talked about today. It is privacy.
The reason it is getting so much
attention is that it is being violated
more and more frequently. /

Anita Bryant violates a teacher’s
right to a private life separate from
the demands and deﬁnitions of his
public life. The pro-lifers foist their
private. personal convictions on
women. Their opinion overides a
woman’s private personal right to
make the decision to live an
unfettered life or to accept the
responsibilities and joys of a child
and parenthood. You, Mr. Shope,
violate an individuals right to a
private decision of how he will
express himself sexually. You
threaten eternal damnation, and
' ’ Msexual

tendency to unpleasant exper-
iences with sex. Your assumptions
are simplistic.

Mr. Shope, the Bible is God’s
word, but" it was written by men
and rewritten by other men. These
men did not know that a North
American continent existed, nor
did they fear the consequences of
continued escalation of a nuclear
arms race. They were not outraged
by promiscuity or deviant V
practices that receive un  I2
coverage by the all-pervasive
media.

You, obviously, are outraged.
You have the right ot be outraged,
just as I have. We both have the
right ot these opinions, but we
don’t have the right ot express
private opinions as public truth.

Homo-sex, bi-sex, hetero-sex, or
no sex, whatever lifestyle one
might chose, it is a private decision
and one that should not be impeded
or inﬂuenced by other opinions or
beliefs.

One last note, Mr. Shope.

“We must be confident the

The decision to participate in the
rally followed dissension within the
task force at its meeting Monday
night. Some task force members
were concerned the rally would
“Get out of hand,” and become a
“Radical and ineffective means to

today, in an unofﬁcial emergency
meeting, task force members
decided to participate in the rally to

to Pennsylvanians, that students

next year if the legislature does not
take action,” Bowers said.

SGB Fills Allocations Spots ‘

By SUE McFARLAND

The Student Government Board
recently approved a ﬁve-member
Allocations Committee, following
the recommendation of a special
search committee that screened 20
applicants.

Richard King, Max Lash. Randy
Mastromonaca, Ken Plucinski and
Mike Seitz were recommended to
SGB by search committee members
Dave Hesidence, Bernie Payne and
Gary Tweed of SGB and Jeff
Barent. David Lowe and Joe
Mclntyre of the previous Alloca-
tions Committee.

The newly-appointed group re-
places a larger eight-member
committee dissolved by SGB in
September when it failed to
schedule meetings all members
could attend.

SGB president Payne claimed
other problems with the fomer
committee were caused by the
group's budgetary inexperience.

“The former Allocations Com-
mittee came into office in February
and was forced to handle the yearly
budget in March without any prior
experience in such matter," Payne
said. "This is one reason why we
changed the Allocations Committee
term of office to range from
October to October instead of
beginning in February. This will
allow newly-selected committee
members to gain several months of
experience before working on the
yearly budget in March."

Former Allocations Committee
member and SGB liason Renee
Fagnani commented on the com-
mittee’s problem.

“We took office in February with

no formal training. We were

thrown into the situation and had to
start hearing budgets. None of the
committee members from 1976
were carried over to our committee
to guide us along the way.”

Fagnani cited several other

problems. “We were faced with an
adversary situation.

personality conflicts and a break-
down in communication." she said.

According to Fagnani, the
friction between the committee and
SGB promoted factionalism.

40 hours a week on budget
preparations. interviews and re-
commendations to the board. The

responsible for the budgets of
almost 70 organizations that
involved handling over $300,000 in
fundings. In addition to the work
during the regular school year, we
were also expected to be here
during spring session. Several of
the members were not from the
Pittsburgh area, so it became
difﬁcult to form a quorum for
meetings."

The former Allocations Com-

mittee coordinator suggested inn-.4‘

bers taught by retiring committee

committee considered grade point
averages, extra-curricular activities
and the positions these individuals
held within these organizations.

The committee will not stay at
five members. “We plan to
re-advertise for new members. but
at this time we only chose five
because we felt it would be better
to have five completely qualified

members than eight who would not”

be able to attend the meetings,
Payne said. ,

Pin News Staff Writer
GAINESVILLE, Fla—Coach
Johhny Majors knew he'd be taking
his lumps this season at Tenn-
essee, but he probably didn’t
expect to come so close to doing it
literally. But that’s almost what
happened when the Volunteers
recently lost to Florida here 27-17.

Losers of five of their ﬁrst seven
games, the men in orange didn’t
take kindly to the Gators blatantly
running up the score, and tempers
ﬂared after the game.

0;. The hostilities started to brew

with 46 seconds left and Florida
leading by three, 20-17. Fearing
Tennessee timeouts could regain
possession if the Gators didn’t move
the ball, Florida coach Doug Dickey
ordered quarterback Terry LeCount
to “tuck the ball under his arm and
run. I didn’t want him to fall on the
ball or sneak. Well, he tucked it
under his arm and ran for 36
yards.”

LeCount handed off to Tony
Green on the next play. Green
scored a touchdown that, coupled
with Berg Yepremian’s conversion,
gave the Gators a 10-point lead.

Dickey’s actions were under-
Standable up to this point: a
three-point lead is not very safe, no
matter how late in the game. But he
lost a great deal of respoect by what
he did after that.

When a Gator pounced on a
Tennessee fumble after the kickoff,
Florida, 10 points ahead, had the
ball on the Volunteer 33 yard line

with 19 seconds left. It was
obviously a time for LeCount to fall
down with the snap, but that’s not

what happened.

LeCount again handed off to
Green, who romped 14 yards to the
19. With three seconds left on the
clock, someone on the Florida bench
signaled for a time out. Dickey,
who preceded Bill Battle (whom
Majors succeeded) as coach at
Tennessee, claims he didn’t do it.

During the timeout, Dickey said,
‘ ‘Again, I told Terry to tuck it under
his arm and run, but he saw Wes
(Chandler) open and threw to
him.”

Chandler was out of the end zone
when he caught the ball, so the
touchdown didn’t count. However,
the thought obviously was there.

When the game ended, Tenn-
essee assistant coach Bill Cox (who
called the plays for Pitt last year) led
a charge across the filed to berate
Dickey. A substantial brawl broke
out, with Volunteer lineman Danny
Jenkins coming away with a‘ bloody
face. Dickey was shoved around,
and a Florida assistant coach was hit
in the face-

Meanwhile, Dickey had egg on
his face. ‘Despite his allegations,_he
was seen urging LeCount to pass on
that ﬁnal play by two Southern
newspaper photographers.

“We were standing very close to
coach Dickey, and he was yelling
‘pass, pass, pass. He even made a
passing motion,” said one of the
photographers.

Majors, naturally, was furious.

On his way to the locker room after
the game, he was showered with
verbal and physical abuse. To one
heckler, he shouted, “You redneck
fat pig, come on down here and say
that.”

Maybe Majors had been called a
damn Yankee. In any case, the 1976
Coach of the Year was enraged.

“We had a two-touchdown lead
on Syracuse last year (actually, 10
points) with seconds to play, and I
made the quarterback sit on the
ball,” he fumed.

Without the aid of players such as
Matt Cavanaugh, Johnny Maiors is

A In a previous Pitt-Syracuse game,
Majors ordered the same quarter-
back (Matt Cavanaugh) to throw a
bomb with a 31-0 lead. At that time,
Majors had been upset by Orange
head coach Frank Maloney’s
remark that only Syracuse would
challenge Penn State for Eastern
supremacy. Many coaches dislike
Maloney, and_ it’s now certain
Majors and Dickey won't be eating
grits together.
“Our little old players fought
their butts off,” said Majors. “l’ve

Pitt’s Women Athletes Face Challange

By KAREN KADILAK

Pill News Staff Writer

The woman athlete has been
chastised, heckled at, and even
consoled since she hit the big-time
scene less than 10 years ago. The
woman athlete has had to live in the
huge and prosperous shadow of her
male counterpart over the last
century—quite a task, considering
the popularity of men's sports.

But the woman athlete hasn’t

been battered to the point of giving

up sports entirely.

Women are proving, that, other
than-the psychological and physio-
logical differences between female
and male athletes, there’s a small
gap in the way males and females
compete in sports.

Women’s sports are getting
better throughout the country, says
Pitt all-American swimmer and
Olympic hopeful, Kathy Stetler.

“I know the competition here at
Pitt is better, ’ ’ Stetler said. ‘ ‘That’s

for sure. I think the same situation

exists throughout the country,too.

“I know there’s an attitude a
woman shouldn’t be competing in
sports, but I guess that attitude will
alway exist, Stetler continued.“It’s
a situation that’s hard to explain.”

Sandra Bullman, Pitt’s assistant
athletic director for woman’s
athletics, thinks she has the
explanation.

“The men's programs have been
around for 75, 100 years,” Bullman
explained. “The woman’s program
in America is barely 10 years old.
We’re still a long, long way off from
reaching the point where the

woman athlete can be compared

favorably to the man athlete in

terms of making money or drawing

Maybe not in nine or 10, maybe
not even in the next 20 years,”
Bullman continued. “It will take
some time. But I can see us getting

there.

“Women are showing they know
how to compete.”

Pitt athletes Kim Raymond,
Peggy Dugan, Stetler, Regina
Carson and Mary Savage have
shown they can compete. Combine
their talents (Raymond and Dugan
in basketball, Stetler in swimming,
Carson in gymnastics and Savage in
volleyball, and you have a gold mine

Olympic talent.

Piper ’s “Can ’t Wait” Worth Listening To

BYJIMFARERI

Can’t Wait
Wwr
A&M

Piper’s “Can’t Wait” is distinct-
ive American rock in 1977. Not as
hard or ﬂamboyant as the big
American mainstay, Aerosmith,
Piper cultivates a simple, straight-
ahead rock’n’roll: Melodic, but not
complex; imaginative, but within
predictable bounds.

\

Piper’s music is more relaxed
when compared with most Ameri-
can big-name rock. Its sound, at
least on record, is soft. But anyone
who has seen Piper live know they
can rock hard with the best of
them.

The tempered production on
“Can’t Wait” doesn’t capture the
punch of the band's live act. Lead
singer Billy Squire’s energy goes
unchartered as does lead guitarist
Tommy Gunn’s sizziling versitllity.

’ RTS/
entertainment

By the same token, the handsome
production gives Piper a cohesive,
consistent sound while also making
“Can’t Wait” palatable to a wider
audience. This is not a hard-rock-
freaks-only album.

Star numbers on the album are
unerring examples of pure-bred
American rock ’n’ roll: driving
rhythm, lively melody, tight guitar
solos and energized vocalizing.

But the phenomenal accomplish-

TaIkingHeads Not Ordinary

ByMﬂﬂ$mEUM_

“Mummy, Daddy come look at me
now,
I’m a big man in a great big town.
Years ago who’d believe it’s true,
Goes to show what a little faith can
do.”

Those words from the “Talking
Heads” premier album could be
applied to the whole “punk
rock-new wave” music scene. And
Pittsburgh, which is rarely fortun-

‘ Jerry

ate to achieve any notable moments
in music, and a rare occasion: a
performance coinciding with the
release of a new album.

Talking Heads is composed of
David Bryne, the group’s lead
guitarist, vocalist and songwriter,
Harrison, on guitar and
keyboards, Chris Frantz, (a Pitts-
burgh native) on drums and
Martina Weymouth, on bass
guitar.

Talking Heads, although it
hasn’t achieved the notoriety of

other New York bands like the
Ramones or Television, has a solid
reputation for professionalism and
energy. So when two capacity
crowds gathered at Antonino’s
monday night, they were expecting
something more than ordinary.
They were not disappointed.
Punk rock, in many respects, is a
reaction to over-engineered, soft,
mindless and sometimes silly
indulgences of the big disco bands.
Talking Heads keeps chord
(Continued on Page 71)

ment of “Can’t Wait” is ﬂawless-
ness. Every one of the 9 Billy
Squire tunes defy being called
ﬁller—even the two slower acoustic
numbers shine.

This consistently is maintained
not by virtuoso musicianship or
innovative songwriting, but by
adhereing to a steady course and
relying on a proven product:
straightforward rock ’n’ roll.

Choice among the seven excep-
tional rockers are the title track an
easy, pretty tune, and “Little Miss
Intent,” featuring a big, unstop-
able rhythm. There is also “Blues
For The Common Man,” an
appropriately bluesy steamer, and
“Comin’ Down Off Your Love,” a
brisk rocker taking a cue from -Ted
Nugent.

In all of the numbers, Billy
Squire cooks up an electriﬁed,
distinctive vocal. He fuels his lyrics
with subjects of traditional interest

 

to rock: girls, the blues and so on. Q_

The two acoustic tracks show
Squire as a composer seeking
variation and dynamism in tradi-
tional ballad-like structures.

Piper is not initiating a musical
revolution. But neither are they
getting by on other people’s licks.
They’re just a well-toned, no-non-
sense band—something that will
always be worth listening to.

Punk rockers Talking Heads came to Antonino’s last week. One of America’s
first punk bands, the appearance coincided with the release of its new album.

changes and rhythm to a minimum. '

After years of moog and tricky tape
loops, it was refreshing to hear the
versatility of a simple electric
guitar again.

But Talking Heads in not simple
or easy to understand. Take, for
instance, the opening lines of
“Happy Day:”

“In my sensations,
I believe I was born with
The things that I know.

 I want to talk like I read,

Before I decide what to do.
And I fell over, and
I couldn’t stand up!”

To put these words in a musical
context is amazingly difficult. To
dance to it would be impossible—a
calculated and desired impossibil-

ity.

The focus of Talking Heads is
David Bryne, the guiding light of
the band. His onstage performance
is a showpiece of nervous energy,
from the wonderful quirky tribute

to his apartment, “Don’t Worry

About the Government,” to the
hysteria of the track titled “Psycho
Killer.” Unfortunately, much of
the energy Talking Heads pro-
duced last Monday night was
diluted on its premier album,
“Talking Heads: 77”

This is probably the fate of all
“new wave" music, since it is
oriented towards small beer halls
and clubs. If the recording studio is

”11ot the perfect home for the “New

Wave,” Antonino’s was.

3 Pitt Poloists Cop Conference Crown

By BOB LABRIOLA

Pill News Staff Writer

WE-ST POINT, N.Y.—The Pitt
water polo team jelled into a
strong, balanced unit last weekend,
capturing the Mid-Atlantic Con-
ference Championships for the
third consecutive year.

As a result, Pitt will be the
number-one seed in the Eastern
Championships, which will be held
from Friday to Sunday at Trees
Pool.

The Panthers went undefeated in
the tournament and repaid some
season-long debts by beating Army
in overtime, 13-11; Bucknell, 17-15
and Cornell, 17-9. Throughout the
matches, Pitt did what was
necessary to win, coming up with

— the clutch goals, ﬁne defensive

plays and key saves at critical

Opponents Fear
Panther Offense

By BOB LABRIOLA

Pin News Staff Writer
Amid speculation surrounding

" upcoming bowl selections, the Pitt

Panthers are preparing to face a
vastly improved Army football team
Saturday in East Rutherford.

On the heels of an impressive
44-3 victory over the West Virginia
Mountaineers, Pitt will be looking
to make it four consectutive wins
over the Cadets. While the
Panthers lead the overall series,
l2-6-2, neither team has been able to
win more than three straight games
dating back to 1931 when the teams
ﬁrst met.

Army relies heavily on the right
arm of quarterback Leamon Hall,
the ﬁnest college quarterback in the

" country, according to one pro scout.

 

Although Hall is not extremely

mobile, he uses his 6-5 frame and
accurate arm to get the ball to his
favorite receiver, tight end Clennie
Brundidge. The Cadets may be
without the services of their leading
rusher, though. Senior Greg King
has been listed as “possible” for
Saturday’s contest.

Like his counterpart at West
Virginia, Army coach Homer Smith
would rather be preparing for Tony
Dorsett than the offense the
Panthers on the ﬁeld this year.

“Pitt will deﬁnitely pose more
problems for us defensively than
they did last year,” Smith said.
‘ ‘You talk about having a wide-open
offense—they can score in so many
different ways. There is no doubt
that their offensive design will be
more taxing for us, even without
Tony Dorsett in the line-up.’’

When asked to compare Pitt to
the Notre Dame squad that defeated
the Cadet, 24-0, Smith was rather
evasive.

“Notre Dame is the bigger team,
but Pitt is quicker,”Smith said.
“When we played the Irish, Joe
Montana had just stepped in at
quarterback and was not yet
comfortable with the position. I’d
have to say that Pitt is more of a
threat to us than Notre Dame was at
that time.

“I’m very pleased with the way
our team has developed during the
season, ’ ’ Smith continued. ‘ ‘We’re

 

The Cadets stormed right back
with three quick goals to lead, 3-1,
and immediately began to play a
sagging defense in order to guard
against Pitt’s drive-to-the-goal
offense. The Panthers adjusted by
shooting from the outside, as
George Machicote and Butch Silva
(on a feed from Mike Mere) scored
to tie it up, 3-3, at the end of the
ﬁrst period.

Opposing coaches claim that it is more difficult to
prepare for the Pitt Panthers this year, because a wide-

Pitt had a chance to blow Army
out of the pool near the end of the
ﬁrs? half. but failed to capitalize
on it. Mike Schoﬁeld scored twice
on assists from Luis Toro and, after
another goal by Silva, Pitt led, 6-4,
as the Cadets called timeout. Army
was able to regain its composure,
though. and goals by Robby Ruck
and Jose Duenas knotted the score
at the half, 6-6.

The third quarter was scoreless, ‘

due largely to the efforts of goalie
Steve Feller. Feller made three
incredible saves, two of them in a
row, and Army had a good chance
to take a two-goal lead into the
fourth period.

Silva’s goal with 2:30 to play
gave Pitt an 8-7 lead, but Ruck soon
added his second clutch goal to tie
another knot, 8-8. Silva answered

Army's upset chances might be
hindered because the game will be
played in East Rutherford rather

than in‘Michie Stadium, the Cadets’
home ﬁeld.

“Although we would rather play
Pitt in our own backyard, it will be a
treat for both teams to play in Giants
Stadium,” Smith said. “We expect

in less than 30 seconds with his
fourth goal of the match, giving Pitt
a 9-8 lead, but Pitt couldn't stand
the prosperity for long.

During a 30-second penalty to
Machicote, Army’s Ken Ragghanti
scored on the power play to tie the
score for the ﬁnal time, 9-9. The
Cadets had one more opportunity
to score in the ﬁnal 30 seconds, but
Feller robbed Bob Bristow in front
of the goal to send the game into
overtime.

The Panthers dominated the
overtime from the start, as

Scholﬁeld and Ruiz each scored two
goals and Pitt held on to win, 13-11.
Schoﬁeld and Silva shared scoring
honors, with four goals apiece;
Toro chipped in three assists and

Feller had seven saves.

Pitt’s Bowl Hopes: Still A Major Question

The bowls won’t even be allowed to hint of ofﬁcial

invitations to college football teams for another 10 days but
the NCAA-imposed rule against meaningful public
statements is neither applicable nor of concern to fans and
writers, so a two-week speculation season promises to
provide a great deal of amusement to many football
followers.

But the current post-season outlook, which has Pitt
looking to be out a major bowl bid, will be a cause for no
amusement to those associated with the Pitt football
program.

Already the Orange, Cotton and Sugar pairings have
been decided in newspapers from Pittsburgh to New
Orleans and San Francisco. And Pitt does not receive one of
the three major bowl berths available to independents in
any of the speculation.

That's unfortunate for Jackie Sherrill, possessor of a ﬁne
football team with one blemish too many on its record. It’s
a team Sherrill hopes he can convince bowl selection
committees to wait for. A week's wait would be ﬁne with
Sherrill, but not with the selection committees.

‘‘I think they’ll wait,” Sherrill said of the Orange Bowl at
yesterday's press luncheon. “The pressure is on them, not
us.

“They want to- get the best game available,” he added.

That's true, but something will get in the way of the logic
that indicates a Pitt-Penn State winner should be decided
before either is invited to a major bowl.

“It’s a panic,” said a bowl spokesman. “It’s going to
come down to a six-hour period that will begin at 3 p.m.
next Saturday. And those six hours will be pure panic. No
one’s going to wait. They can’t afford to.”

That panic will force the bowls to gamble Nov. 19 on
games that will continue until Dec. 3. According to the
most widely circulated rumors, here’s what Pitt fans can
look forward to (or fear) Nov. 19: _

The Cotton Bowl, searching for a national championship
game and aware that no one has the draw of the Irish, will
bet that Notre Dame can defeat Miami of Florida Dec. 3.

The Sugar Bowl, which would like to see how a Big 10

Eastern Team, will select a big, slow Big 10 runnerup.

The Orange Bowl, which has professed a preference for
Notre Dame, will instead take Penn State over Pitt because
of the Lions’ better record and slightly more difﬁcult
schedule

   

  

And, in a striking example of how things _can change in 12
months, Pitt, which last year had every bowl more than 12
inches in diameter begging, will take a Gator Bowl
invitation and wrestle with second-guessers who will note
that Pitt got $250,000 for moving the Penn State game, but
lost a chance at the Orange's $1,000,000 in the process.
The defending champion Panthers then will watch this
year’s championship be decided at the Cotton Bowl, which
last year had a strong resemblance to an Army-Navy game.
All this speculation is based on the assumption Penn
State, Notre Dame, and the Big 10 runnerup will not lose
this week. -,Notre Dame, playing Clemson, will have the
toughest assignment.
After those games, it will be selection time for the major
bowls. They'll know who they want Monday; they’ll know
who they have after next Saturday’s six hours of panic.

One way Pitt could have a chance for a major bowl
appearance would come through a Nov. 19 package deal

‘among Pitt, Penn State and a couple of bowls. According to

this theory, it would be agreed that the winner of the Nov.
26 game at Pitt Stadium would accept an Orange Bowl bid,
and the loser would go to a lesser bowl——almost surely the
Gator. ’ ’

Lafferty said, perhaps tipping his inﬂuential hand toward
Penn State. “But the schools would have to agree to that.”

‘‘If Penn State were crazy enough to go for that, they
wouldn‘t be where they are today,” said an ofﬁcial from
another bowl, who understandably asked not to be
identiﬁed. “And even then, it wouldn't be able to be
discussed until the deadline, and no major bowl is going to
balance its year on such a shaky proposal.”

Each of the big bowls, not willing to chance offending any
school, still has the same basic list of “wanted” teams.
“We keep them aware of our interest in their programs,”
one bowl spokesman said, “because we have past, present
and future relations to consider.” '

So each bowl will say it still is interested in Pitt, Penn
State, the Big 10 runnerup, Notre Dame and the Southwest -
Conference runnerup, though an Eastern team is not likely
to end up in the Cotton, and the Southwest Conference team
probably will not play in the Sugar.

The bowls’ selection process has been made more
difﬁcult by the number of late and important games, but
that hasn't seemed to elicit any change in the easygoing
manner of most bowl officials. In fact, they seem to be.
enjoying this time as much as the NCAA muzzle will allow.
(The Orange Bowl apparently drooled over Pitt a bit too
publicly last year, for the NCAA has notiﬁed the bowls that
ﬁnes for pre-deadline public preferences could be
substantial.)

“lt’s not really a bad year,” said Wilbur Evans of the
Cotton Bowl. “You have only one undefeated team in the
bowl picture, and that's unusual. ‘

“But,” he added with a chuckle, “as long as we have that
undefeated team (Texas), we won’t feel so bad at all.”

And Carl James, executive director of the Sugar Bowl,
also was in a good mood "yesterday. When I closed an
interview by saying, “Hope to see you sometime around the
ﬁrst of January,” James replied, in the best tradition of
cautious but pleasant bowl ofﬁcials: A

“Well, I’d like to see you, too, but instead of putting a
time on that, why don’t we just make it, ‘I hope to see yo,

Pitt News Staff Writer

Through its ﬁrst 10 games, the
Pitt offensive football team has
become notorious for its slow
starts. .

The Panthers just haven’t been
able to get their act together
offensively in the ﬁrst halves of the
games they have played so far.
But, as its 8-1-1 record indicates,
Pitt hasn't been hurt by the early
game sluggishness of the offensive
Pitt has been able to
compensate for its lack of ﬁrepower
in the early stages of the game with
plenty of late-game offensive
punch.

Saturday, in the Panther’s game
with West Virginia at Morgantown,
the situation was no different. It
wasn’t until past the midway mark
of the ﬁrst quarter, with West
Virginia leading 3-0, that Pitt
-generated its first real offensive
drive of the afternoon. But again,
Pitt made up for its lack of
offense in the first eight minutes of
Saturday’s game with a three-
quarter onslaught, which led the
Panthers to their convincing 44-3
win over the Mountaineers.

The situation puzzles people.

‘  l4—THE PITT NEWS——Wednesday,.November 9. 1977

How can a team be so nonexplosive
in the ﬁrst and second quarters and

be so explosive in the last two or
three quarters?

Pitt offensive guard Jim Buoy
and offensive line coach Don Boyce
think they have the answer to that
question. '

“They've been showing us a
different defense every week,”
Buoy explained. “It takes time to
feel out the things the other teams
are doing defensively. Once we do
that, we get some momentum and
we're all right.

“They’ve been playing a lot of
stuff we haven’t seen before,”
Boyce added. “You’ve got to
expect that each week, since
there’s no one way an opponent can
stop us defensively.”

West Virginia, Buoy pointed out,
was no different in that respect.
The Mountaineers also experi-
mented, in an attempt to stop the
Pitt offense. .

“They were moving a lot
defensively,” Buoy stated. “They
showed us several different defens-
ive looks. It took us a little time to
get accustomed to what they were

playing.”

Yes, it did. It wasn’t until past
the midway mark of the ﬁrst
quarter that Pitt got its offense into
gear. But, when they got thost ﬁrst
few touchdowns on the board, the
momentum carried them the rest of
the way. In this case, it was to the
biggest point difference in the
history of ‘the Pitt-West Virginia
rivalry, and one of ' the most
impressive statistical offensive
performances of the season for the
Panthers.

“We aren’t necessarily confused
about the defenses teams are
playing against us,” Bouy said. “It
just takes us a little time to get the
feel of things. See what the other
team’s doing against us defen-
sively.

“Like I said earlier,” Buoy
continued, “once we get that
momentum and take the other
team’s away, we’re all right. We
start to score some touchdowns.
That’s what we did against West
Virginia Saturday. We took their
momentum away.”

Buoyplayed the best game of his
career at Pitt Saturday against
West Virginia. The 6-0, 240-pound

e Unexpected

senior from Miami Jackson High
School. who got his ﬁrst chance to
start this season after spending
most of his career on the bench,
graded out as the Panthers’ top
offensive lineman on a day when
any of Buoy’s mates along the
offensive front wall could have
been similarly honored.

“I had a good day,” Buoy said,
“but I think I could have had an
even better one. I made a few
mistakes on my pass blocking. As a
whole, I think our line had a great
game. Art, George, Tom, Matt.
They all had great games.”

Boyce said he hopes his
offensive charges have a few more
“great days,” starting Saturday,
when Pitt meets what Boyce feels is
a much-improved Army team at
Giants Stadium in East Rutherford,
N.J.

“We’ve been looking at ﬁlms of
Army,” the Panther offensive line
coach said, “They’re a better
football team than they were last
year. We’ll have to be ready.”

“They play a lot of the 5-2
defense,” Boyce explained. But
you can expect them to use some
different defenses against us.
Everybody else has.”

Jim Buoy would agree with that.

Eastem Championships Face Poloists A fter Conference Win

Pitt Triumphs
In Playoff A ction

Politics Cloud
Polo Victory

at West Point

By BOB LABRIOLA

Pitt News Staff Writer

WEST POINT, N.Y.—Some-
times you scratch and claw for
something you want very much,
only to have it taken away in an
underhanded manner. This seems
to be a common practice in water
polo, and Pitt has been a regular
victim of such political moves.

Not long ago, it was reported
Brown University had declined to

A participate in the Eastern cham-

pionships, believing that, since
their coach was on the NCAA
selection committee, the best way

_to get a bid to the National

‘Championship Tournament was to
only play the teams it could heat. A
funny thing happened to Brown
on the way to trying to pull one over
on the NCAA: it lost to Army at the
Yale, Invitational.

Losing to Army, which ﬁnished
third in the Mid-Atlantic Con-
ference, eliminated Brown’s
chance of using the back door to
sneak into the NCAA Tournament.
Suddenly, the prior committments
that were going to prevent Brown
from competing in the Eastems
have vanished, and it is presently
seeking a bid for the weekend
tournament to be held at Trees
Pool. Whether they get it or not has
yet to be determined.

Both Pitt coach Minguel Rivera
and Paul Baron, who is in charge of
the league’s referees, would like
the tournament to be a round-robin
in order to yield a true winner. Dick
Russell, coach at Bucknell, favors a
single elimination tournament,
meaning that a team that loses its
ﬁrst-round match could ﬁnish no
higher than ﬁfth.

The single elimination format
would favor Pitt, as the Panthers,
being number-one seed, would
play the fourth‘-place team from the
Mid-Atlantic Conference, Cornell,
in the ﬁrst round. Number-two
Bucknell would face Army, which
finished in third place.

Now, Russell, who is also head of
the Mid-Atlantic Conference,
wants to make another “minor
change.” Russell would have Pitt
playing Army, while his Bucknell
team would play Cornell. The ﬁrst
vs. fourth and second vs. third
format has been in effect for the
Easterns for several years, and
Russell wants to change it to
beneﬁt his team in what seems to
be an abuse of power.

Also, the selection of the

all-conference team also bears
some anti-Pitt overtones. Last year,
Pitt captured the tournament and
Bucknell ﬁnished second, but a
look at the all-conference selections
would indicate just the opposite.
Bucknell placed four players on the
squad while only two members of
the Pitt team were cited for the
honors.
* This year, the number of
Bucknell players selected was not
as incriminating as was the
absence of Pitt players. A
breakdown of the selections shows
two picks each from Pitt, Army and
Bucknell and one player chosen
from last-place Cornell.

Sicne only a starting line-up was
selected as opposed to an entire
squad, the inclusion of a player
from Cornell, which was beaten
badly in each of their three games,
is dubious at best.

How could the goalie from the
third-place team (Mike Lally of
Army) be selected All-Conference
over the goalie. from the team
which won the tournament? Steve
Feller allowed fewer goals than
Lally, and more importantly was a
key factor in Pitt’s drive to the

championship. Throughout the
world of sports, individual honors
are awarded on the basis of
personal performance viewed in
the light of the team’s success.
Evidently, this is not the case in
water polo.

Only the coaches and officials are
permitted to vote for the all-
conference team, and the coaches
are not permitted to vote for their
players. What the actual break-
down of the voting was is not
known, as Rivera’s request to see
the ballots was denied.

The voting was to be made on the
basis of the performances at the
tournament, with the regular
season having no effect on the
outcome. The undercover manner
in which the affair was handled
indicates some foul play, whether it
was in the nature of blackballing or
vote-tampering. The system should
either be changed so that further
injustices are avoided, or the
practice should simply be abol-
ished, because as it stands now,
the all-conference team is a farce.

It seems that Eastern water. polo
is a rather close-knit fraternity that
was not prepared to get beaten
year after year by the upstarts from
Pitt. The Panthers have a different
view of what it takes to have a
successful program, and, thus far,
it has worked remarkably well.
Maybe being different will not
always be associated with being
wrong.

Until that time comes, the Pitt
water polo team might as well face
the fact that certain powerful
people will stop at nothing to return
things to the status quo. ‘

(Continued from Page I 3)

“We needed a win to boost our
confidence,” said coach Rivera.
“Our defense was shabby at times,
and we have to learn to take the
outside shot when it is give, but
this can be corrected. Mistakes are
a lot easier to live with after a
victory.”

Saturday night Pitt faced Buck-
nell, looking for its ﬁrst win over
the Bisons this season. Each squad
played extremely well, and the
game turned into the best match of
the tournament. It pitted against
one another the two best teams in
the East and two opposite coaching
philosophies. This time, ﬁnesse
triumphed over strength as Pitt
won, 17-15, in a thriller.

The Panthersopened the match
by running their offense to
perfection, moving the ball, and
drawing fouls, as four different
players scored to launch Pitt to a
4-3 lead after the ﬁrst stanza.

From the middle of the second
period, when Bucknell took the
lead, 5-4, until halfway through the
third quarter, the Panthers played
nearly perfect polo. Silva and
Machicote were outstanding;
Machicote had two assists and a
steal, which led to'a goal by Mike
Mere, and ran the -offense
brilliantly from his post position.
Silva scored four goals during a
six-minute stretch to push Pitt back
out in front, 10-.8.

Bucknell made several rushes to
regain the lead, but the Panthers
refused to fold, and won 17-15. The
officials refused to allow excessive
force, and assessed 27 major
infractions, 16 of them against the
Bisons. Silva led the way with six
goals, and Mere added four to
highlight the offense. Feller, with
eight saves, had another good
game in goal.

“We wanted this one very
badly,” Rivera said after the
match. “All year, l’ve been saying
we could beat Bucknell, and this

time we put it all together. Our

defense has been our enemy all
year long, and it still isn’t where I’d
like it to be. But this time, the other
aspects of our game made up for
any lapses.”

Pitt needed a win over Cornell on
Sunday to top off what already had.
been accomplished in the tourna-
ment. It took the Panthers one
period to get untracked, but after
that the outcome was never in
doubt as Pitt won, 17-9.

Cornell led, 3-1, after the ﬁrst

quarter, but then Pitt erupted. The A

Panthers outscored Cornell, 9-2,
over the next period and a half, and
by the middle of the third quarter
they held a safe 10-S cushion.
The key to this success was Pitt_{s
ability to move the ball and sticl(’4..

its offensivse patterns. During the o '

blitz, every Panther in the wata
(except the goalie) scored, and no
one had more than two goals. This
balance and ball movement is an
unbeatable combination, as de-
fenese rarely are able to contain
offenses that have more than a
couple of scoring threats.

The Panthers never let up
against Cornell and outscored the
Big Red, 6-2, in the ﬁnal period to
turn the match into a rout. In the
victory, Machicote, Ruiz, Silva. 
Toro scored three apiece; Mere ik

Schoﬁeld chipped in two apiece“

and Barry Ford added one.

“l_said that we would win the
tournament if we didn’t beat
ourselves,” Rivera said.“‘We ran
the plays on offense, and Steve
(Feller) played three great games
when we really needed them. l just
can’t say enough about how well
the guys played. I was proud of
them.”

WASHINGTON [AP]-The Wash-
ington Redskins will ﬁle an appeal
to the National Football League
ofﬁce over the ﬁnal two seconds of
their game with the Baltimore
Colts.

They don’t expect to win.

Coach George Allen said yester-
day that the Redskins had gotten the
ﬁnal play started although’ referee
Chuck Heberling ruled Monday
night that time had expired before
the snap.

With the Redskins out of
timeouts, quarterback Joe Theis-
mann completed a 21-yard pass to
Frank Grant to the Colts’ 13. The
ofﬁcials stopped the clock with two
seconds to play to allow the Colts
defensive players to get back to the
line of scrimmage.

Theismann took the snap from
center Len Hauss and completed a
13-yard pass to Calvin Hill for what
would have been the tying
touchdown. The Redskins lost, l0-3.

Allen said, after looking at the
ﬁlms of the game, “When the gun
went off and the smoke was in the
air, Joe had the ball in his hands.

The play should have been

allowed.”
Allen said he thought that

Thiesmann should have been
poised over the center to take the
snap as soon as the referee stepped
away from the ball but “Joe was
trying to direct the receivers. It
would have been better had he been

do their job.”

Allen said he will ﬁle the appeal
on the form all coaches ﬁll out after

each game “but it’s probably not .

going to do any good.”

In Baltimore, Coach Ted Marchi-
broda of the Colts said he’ “saw
nothing wrong with the way officials
handled the ﬁnal play.

“There were about eight or nine
seconds left when the pass was
completed,” said Marchibroda,
who served nine years as an aide to
Allen, “And I didn't think they’d
have enouth time to get another
play off.”

Two seconds showed on the
stadium clock when officials
momentarily called time to allow
Baltimore players to come down-
field and reach the , line of
scrimmage. The clock then was
restarted, and officials ruled that
time expired before the ball was

snapped. I
