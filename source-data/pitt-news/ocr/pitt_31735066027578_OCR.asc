State police raid a local bar  

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

‘ Panic and pandemonium
raced through an Oakland bar
last Thursday in one of the

biggest alcohol raids in recent *

Pennsylvania State Police
history.

Over 200 Pitt students were
cited for underage drinking at
Zelda’.s Greenhouse, 117
South Bouquet Street,‘ at
11:10 _p.m., on what is tradi-
tionallyone of the busier

nights for the bar. The raid

was a result of an undercover

operation initiated by the

Bureau of Liquor Control
Enforcement.

Forty-three minors were
cited for underage drinking
and another 210 citations are
pending against minors who

‘ didn’t have proper identifica-

tion. Criminal charges are

also being brought against the

owner of Zelda’s and 10 other
individuals from the estab-

lishment, including selling.

alcohol to minors and gram“-
bling, according to State
Police.

Over 10,000 people gathered for Pi

to climb through windows in
the back greenhouse 1 section, ‘
to get outside or onto the

roof. Others hustled out on

the street to try and avoid the
police. ~ '
“Someone tried’ to" tear a

. hole through the wall in the

was at Zelda’s and given a

Speaker reveals gender bias in education

By Steve Westrick
Staff Writer

At every level of school,
male students generally get
more attention and a better
education then female stu-
dents. V ,

That was the message
given by David Sadker
Thursday evening during a
speech at Pitt about sexual
bias in the classroom.

David Sadker, a professor

of education at American
University and one of the
leading researchers in the
area of sexual bias,
addressed an audience of
approximately 100 people
in David Lawrence Hall.
During the speech Sadker
performed some role play-
ing with members of the
audience.’ Taking two
female and two male volun-
teers, Sadker demonstrated

how teachers often uncon-

sciously give more atten-
tion to male students.
Before beginning the role
playing Sadker challenged
the audience to count the
number of biases that occur
during his example. After
the demonstration Sadker
asked the audience to share
with him the various biases
they noticed. The audience

responded by noticing 22

different types of biases.
These biases ranged from

giving more advice to male
students, to waiting longer
for a response after asking
a question of a male stu-
dent and giving less time
for a female student to
respond.

“This is not an excep-
tion.” Sadker said. “This in
most cases is the norm.”

Sadker also talked about
bias that occurs in text-
books. Taking a textbook

Jews migrate to Germany for better economy

MAGDENBURG, GER-

MANY — In increasing num-
bers. Jews from the former Soviet
Union are moving to Germany
for economic, not spiritual, rea-
sons. _ '

Their joumey is part of a quiet
footnote to Gerrnany’s reur1iﬁca—
tion ﬁve years ago. Since 1990,
more than 22,00() Jews from the
former Soviet Union have come
to settle in the land that once
sought to exterminate Jews,

almost doubling the Jewish popu- «

lationto around 50,000.

The number of immigrants
who have been accepted as Jews
by official Jewish organizations
in Germany is only about two-
thirds of the 35,000 former
Soviet citizens who have claimed
to be Jewish to enter Germany
under regulations permitting
Jewish migration.

Worksho l1elpsPitt
students incl jobs  

By Christin Cvetic
For The Pitt News

If you have begun to feel
anxiety-ridden over your
impending graduation and
the fact that you have yet to
be offered a‘ job, the
Placement Service may have

‘the answer for you.

Beginning today is a
week—long program spon-
sored by the Placement
Service I called
“Opportunities ‘95: Passport
to Your Future.” While the
event centers around a job
fair to be held Wednesday, a
networking workshop will
take place today.

“We are always telling
students to network but we
never really show them how

to do it,” said Lisa Perry, a

placement counselor. “This
workshop not only shows
them how to network, but
how to do it well.”
Networking will also be
discussed tomorrow in a
networking reception from 6
to 8 p.m. in the William Pitt
Union Ballroom. This
reception is for juniors,
seniors and alumni regis-
tered with the Placement
Service. It is designed to
provide a first—hand oppor-

tunity to get an insider’s
view of a job fair ——' stu-
dents can see what employ-
ers actually look for.

A job fair will be held
Wednesday in which 78
companies will participate.
The employers participating
have paid to attend this fair,

demonstrating their interest

in Pitt students.

“The employers are as
interested in Pitt as Pitt is in
theemployers,” Perry said.

Placement Service coun-
selors felt the need for a job
fair because of the fact that
other job fairs in the area
are often too far away. Also,
the job fair formerly held by
the Career Development
Program was basically just
information sharing with no
real exchange of résumés.

“This job fair is not just
for information,” Perry said.
“These employers are actu-

ally recruiting. They are

expecting to see suits, nice
outfits, and resumes.”

The job fair, to be held
Wednesday in the WPU
Ballroom‘-and Assembly
Room from 10 am‘. to 4
p.m., is open to all students
and alumni. While post-
graduation jobs can be

Ti":-h NaiioncTiiy Room filled with Celtic culture

By Beth McLaughlin
For The Pitt News

 

 

Looking for a leprechaun
and a pot of gold? Try the
Irish Nationality Room in the
Cathedral of Learning.

OK, so maybe you won’t
have any luck finding a four-
inch man, but the room is full
of treasures. The Irish Room
shows Ireland’s culture
through art, architecture, lan-
guage and religion.

“I love this room. It’s so
quiet, and I notice something
new every time I come in
here,” said Yvonne
Buterbaugh, president of Quo
Vadis.

The room is a reconstruc-
tion of an early Christian ora-

' tory, a small stone chapel on

the west coast of Ireland. The
vestibule archway is a portal
into another time. The stone
walls with their detailed carv-
ings are relaxing. Celtic
designsand masks are carved
into the gray walls. The hair
from the masks are inter-
twined with the circular
carved patterns that give a
never-ending effect.

Irish wolf hounds are
carved into the tops of the

oak chairs and benches. The
masked faces, birds and
hounds stare at anyone who
enters, guarding all from spir-
its.

“When a person sits in a
chair like this, the wolf heads
protect them from evil,”
Buterbaugh said. “All of the

Religion is still a big part of
Ireland’s culture and is one
reason why the country is
divided.

Built in the wall is a cor-
nerstone with a Gaelic say-
ing: “Do Cum Gloire De agus
onora na h-Eireann,” mean-
ing: “To the glory of God and

the Honor of Ireland.” The ’

cornerstone is from the
Abbey Clonmacneis at
Athlone, and inside is soil
from the two opposing parts
of Ireland.

“The purpose of putting
both soils in the stone is to
symbolize the hope of the
country reuniting,”
Buterbaugh said.

“The Irish community in
Pittsburgh is very excited
about this room,” Buterbaugh

said. “The Irish Nationality A

Room Committee keeps its
records and documents in the
archives in the wall.'‘

tour will display holiday dec-
orations and people dressed

Tl-ASiVCllUCll3le asset to
classroom experience

By Joseph Kielec
For The Pitt News

If you have a lecture class,
then you probably have

teaching assistants — you

know, those graduate students
who run recitation sections
and veg-out in class. ’

Buttheir jobs entail more
than just baby—sitting a bunch
of undergrads. The teaching
assistant (TA) program pro-
vides graduate students with
valuable teaching experience,
while adding another dimen-
sion to undergraduate courses
that usually revolve around
large impersonal lectures.

The range of responsibili-
ties of TAs vary from class to
class, and fromdepartment to
department.

The recitation classes are
the most important aspect of
the TA program, for it is
there that the assistants are

able to work directly with
students.

“It gives the st_udents a
chance to interact on a per-
sonal level,” said TA
Minhnoi Wroble.‘ “I expect
[recitations] to be a fun part
of the class. It will be less
book knowledge and more
life knowledge.”

TAs Cindy Smith and
Wroble, who work" for Bruce
Goldstein’s “Psychology as a
Natural Science” class, say
their responsibilities include
providing important feedback
to the professor.

TAs are also responsible for
planning the recitation sec-
tions each week, -of which
they usually have four and
sometimes even more. They
must review the information
covered in the course well
enough to be able to teach it
to a class.

Some say this can be a

good review for material they
haven’t covered in years, and
it helps them to build a
stronger foundation of their
own knowledge about a sub-
ject. '

“The best way to learn
something is to teach it,” said
TA Charlie Knight.

Besides having to study the
class material inside and out,
TAs are also required to have
office hours every week, and
are often responsible for the
distribution and grading of
homework assignments and
quizzes. In -some depart-
ments, assistants work direct-
ly with the professor prepar-

ing and grading tests.

With all these responsibili-
ties, some TAs struggle to
balance their own school
loads with their teaching
schedules.

Completing a doctoral
graduate program is a daunt-
ing enough task; add to that
the time and responsibilities
of being a TA, and it becomes
even harder. _

“It is a lot more work than I
expected,” Wroble said.

Students lor Lile
plans future at Pitt

By Stephanie Ellsworth
For the Pitt News

Although Pitt Students for
Life has not yet formally orga-
nized, plans for the year are
being made, according to

Booker Stallworth, former vice .

president and current member
of SfL.

The group will most likely
participate in the same events
as in the past, as well as host-
ing guest speakers throughout
the year, Stallworth said.

Last year, members of Pitt
SfL attended Project Multitude,
a peaceful protest in which pro-
life advocates gathered one
Saturday every month to pray
outside Women’s Health
Services, a downtown
Pittsburgh abortion clinic.
Participants are given rules
before the protest to deter vio-
lence, Stallworth said.

peaceful prayer,” he said.

In addition to a silent protest.
SfL provides information about
options and services available
to pregnant women, as well as
a number of support groups for
those who have had abortions.

“It’s one of the best things
we do,” Stallworth said. “It
gives them a concrete alterna-
tive.”

Some of those services
include Mom’s House, which
offers child care and assistance
for women who wish to return
to school in exchange for vol-
unteer work at the facility, and
Crisis Pregnancy Centers, an
organization that provides
infant clothing and supplies.

One of the support groups
SfL refers women to is Women
Exploited by Abortion, a group
designed for women dealing
with the physical or emotional
problems caused by abortion,
according to Stallworth.

: Bias



°Frompage1
made for young children,
he showed how all posi-
tions of importance, like
doctors and pilots, are
shown to young children
as positions filled by men.

Sadker explained that
these biases are often very
subtle and hard to notice
without some training in
the field of sexual bias.

Sadker went on to
explain that many
American classrooms are
under an unknown self-
imposed segregation.

“Fifty percent of
American classrooms are
segregated by sex,” he
said..“Sometimes it is set
up by the teacher, but
more often it is set up by
the studentsand allowed
by the teacher.”

Sadker went on to
explain that this segrega-
tion in the American
classroom is a major fac-
tor in the frustration felt
by many women.

“Female frustration is
always turned in at them-
selves where male frustra-
tior. is turned outward.”
he said. “This is a direct
product of the American
educational system.”

Sadker first started his
research in the area of
gender equality 25 years
ago with his late wife
Myra Sadker. Together the
two co—authored five
books. The latest. “Failing
at Fairness,” was pub-
lished in 1994 and deals
solely with the problem of

sexual bias in the class-.

room.

Susan Short and Kelli
Wood, two teachers at a
private all-male school
that will soon become a
co-ed school, said they
felt the information in the
speech could really bene-
fit their school during its
transition.

“I think what I was
looking for was how to
bring it back to our class-
rooms,” Short said.

Some Pitt professors and
other faculty members
also attended the speech
to learn how they could
better deal with sexual
bias in their classes.

Regina Schulte-
Ladbeck, an assistant pro-
fessor in astronomy, said
she felt attending the
speech would benefit her
teaching. 9

“I have a class of six
students right now —
three males and three
females,” she said. “I am
now going to be very
aware if I am acting dif-
ferently [toward] them.”

A reception followed the
speech. At the reception
the audience members
were given a chance.to see
a photographic exhibit
made to celebrate the 100-
year anniversary of
women being admitted to
the university. '

Crackdown

°From page 1

Pi_tt News. This past month
the blotter listed numerous
individuals who were
arrested or cited under
these offenses.

Boyd said there was no
particular incident that led
to the active enforcement
of these laws.

“There are very few
crime incidents we
respond to that in one way
or another are not
related to substance abuse,”
Boyd said. “For one thing,
it’s wrong for police to
overlook substance
abuse in a community,
and this campus is our
community.” .

According to Boyd, the
attitude law enforcement
gets when they crack down
on these offenses is that it’s
a waste of time.

“People think the police’s
job is to just catch
rapists and murders.” Boyd
said. “Actually, more time

is spent keeping the peace
than catching the bad guy.”

Boyd said the real waste
of time is when an officer
only intervenes if a serious
crime is in occurrence.

“Most serious crimes
happen behind closed doors
and in remote areas,” Boyd
said.

It is too early to calculate
the number of drug and
alcohol arrests Pitt Police
have made so far, but since
1992 arrests have been on
the rise. The campus
crime statistic rates show

that between 1992 and‘

1994, the number of
drug abuse violations went
from 8. to 57. The number
of liquor law violations
rose from 8 to 46.

“There are no excuses to
overlook it,” said Boyd. “If
we can stop someone from
drinking. into a helpless
state, then I think we have
done a. valuable service.”
Boyd said.

that all the allegations
against Zelda’s were valid,”
Jones said.

Jones said the students who
did not have proper identifi-
cation “will be identified and
citations will be given to
them.”

The maximum fine for the
citations is $300 plus court
costs and, according to
Jones, an individual’s
Pennsylvania driver’s license
can be suspended for up to
90 days.

“It’s basically up to the city
magistrate,” Jones said.

The future of Zelda’s is
now in limbo. However,
Jones said the BLCE does
not have the authority to
close down the bar. It will be
up to an administrate law
judge.

Jones added that employ-
ees and the owner of Zelda’s
might have to pay fines if
they are convicted of any
criminal activity.

PRINCIPLES.2_/‘SOUND RETIREMENT INVESTING

RECENTLY,

MORNINGSTAR CALLED

US CHEAP.

IT’S NOT EVERY DAY
YOU GET A COMPLIMENT

LIKE THAT.

ll financial companies charge operating fees

some more than others. Of

course, the lower the expenses you pay, the better.
That way more of your money goes where it should
— towards building a comfortable future.

We make low expenses at high priority.

Because of our size and our ‘exclusive focus on
/ serving the needs of educational and research
communities, TIAA-CREF's costs are among the
lowest in the insurance and mutual funds

In fact, Morningstar, Inc. —- one of the nation's
leading sources of variable annuity and mutual fund
information -— says, "Size isn't a constraint;
it... enables CREF to realize a remarkable economy of
scale.” According to Morningstar's data, CREF's
"minuscule" 0.51% average fund expense charge was
less than half that charged by comparable funds.5

TIAA's traditional annuity also charges no fees

for those who shape it.“

aside from a very modest operating expense of 1/4 of
1% of annuity assets. Interest and dividends are
reported after all operating costs have been deducted.
Standard & Poor's calls TIAA's costs "exceptionally

low "4

Of course, expenses are only one factor to consider
when you make an investment decision. While we're
committed to keeping our expenses down, we spare
nothing in trying to provide top-quality investment
choices, financial expertise, and personal service.
Because that can make a difference in the long run,

too.

TIAA-CREF seeks performance, not profit.

At TIAA-CREF, we believe people would like to
spend more on retirement, not on their retirement

Teaching-

°Fr0m page 4

While the program pays
for their graduate studies,
TAs receive no credit for
their work. A large portion
of graduate studies involves
research, and being a TA
takes away from time that
could be spent on studies.

But the goal of many grad-
uate students is to teach at a
university level, and being a
TA is good experience for
them. _

“They are getting some-
thing out of doing it,”
Goldstein said. “They are
doing it for themselves.”

The program provides
funding for students who
couldn’t normally afford a
graduate-level education.
The tuition fee for teaching
assistants is waived, and they
also receive a monthly
stipend to cover living
expenses.

Knight, in his third year of
graduate school at Pitt,
couldn’t have continued his
graduate studies had he not
been offered a TA position
from the anthropology
department. During the sum-
mer months, Knight works
with a professor from Ithaca
college at :1 site in Vera Cruz,
Mexico.

The admissions process to
Pitt’s graduate schools are
competitive, but in most
departments TA positions are
available for students that
need funding.

Many TAs are new to the
program and have no prior
teaching experience. But this
lack of experience can be
compensated for with enthu-
siasm and being able to
relate to students on a more
personal level than their pro-
fessors.

“It’s exciting;” Smith said.
“It’s a new experience to
teach.”

The Faculty Development
Program helps to prepare
TAs for the classroom expe-
rience.

Many students have been
impressed with the level of
professionalism of their TAs.

“It surprised me,” said
freshman Alissa Albert, a
pharmacy major. “They actu-
ally do a good job.”

“I’ve heard good stories
and bad stories about teach-
ing assistants,” said fresh-
man Chris Barakos, “but so
far, so good.” '

One hell of a night...

Congratulations to Zelda’s for setting a new state record!
Such a prestigious title is not an easy thing to win, but darnit,
this is a proud moment for Oakland. It’s not every day we have
an award winner in our midst, after all.

In case you hadn’t heard, Zelda’s now holds the unofficial
record for the most citations issued in one place at one time.
Pittsburgh City Police aided the Bureau of Liquor Control
Enforcement’s raid of the Oakland bar last Thursday night and

"issued 253 citations for underage drinking and other offenses,

and some employees of the bar are facing criminal charges.

It shouldn’t be a big surprise to anyone that there were
underage people drinking in Zelda’s. Barely a freshman leaves
his or her first day at Pitt without knowing that Zelda’s is the
place to go. Everyone also knows that it only takes a Pitt stu-
dent ID to get in the door.

Whether or not you agree with underage drinking laws, the .

laws are there. It is illegal to drink an alcoholic beverage if
you are under 21, and it is illegalto serve alcohol to anyone
underage. It won’t make much difference to the judge that you

didn’t feel the law was fair. You get the fine and the license ,

suspension.

So it’s about time the BLCE moved in on such an obvious
headquarters of underage drinking. And they are not the only
ones that are cracking down on underage drinking.’

Pitt Police are starting "to move more often into fraternity
houses located on the hill by Sutherland Hall.‘ According to
Pitt Police Chief Rick Boyd, “there are very few crime inci-
dents we respond to that in one way or another are not related
to substance abuse.” -

Good point. The statistics about the correlation between sex-
ual assaults and/or rapes and alcohol abuse are pretty over-
whelming. And anyone who has ever been to Zelda’s has seen
a serious meat market where alcohol is a main ingredient. a

Last February, The Pitt News reported on an alleged sexual
assault that happened after a male and female left an Oakland
bar. The case hit many roadblocks for police, mostly because
the victim was too intoxicated the night of the incident to
remember anything. The whol.e cycle of events began when
the 18-year-old student was allowed in the bar in the first
place.

probation and had to perform community service for their
roles at a fraternity party. Guess what was involved at this
combine party? Give, up? An alleged sexual assault and under-
age drinking. ‘ ' ‘

Underage drinking is not just going on at Pitt. It happens 'at ~

. Penn State, Syracuse and just about every college in the coun-

try. Obviously, one BLCE raid is not going to put a permanent,
across-the-board halt to underage drinking. .

But that doesn’t make Zelda’s or fraternity houses right for
constantly _serving alcohol to minors. A law is a law.

What exactly
do these buzz-

describe?
_ What is this
Robert behavioral
Chesnavichdesc ription
j"""'_"‘ that so many
people refer to when the topic

 

“of social spending comes _up?

What is so reprehensible about
being “on the dole” thatwe are
required to keep people from
doing so? , A

According to some, this men-
tality.doesn’t exist. It is some-
thing, -they say, which. those
nasty Republicans have invent-
ed as an excuse to keep the
needy fromtheir economic sup-
port. Those who can’t find jobs
simply aren’t being lazy:
they’re trying their best and just
carmot find any. No one really
wants. to live off of the govem-
ment.

These, my friends, are not
only myths, but they are myths
essential to maintaining the cur-
rent ‘status quo, and the last
thing that the spend-more side
needs to have is a light focused
on what decadesof “support”
have done. As someone who

has spent a decent amount of E

time around the welfare culture,
I feel it would behoove many to
have me relate some experi-
ences which may help to define
this oft-used phrase. I

So then, what is the “dole
mentality”? Well, let me start
by describing Halloween Night,
1993. '

I was working then at the
Uni-Mart on the Boulevard of
the Allies in South Oakland.
We had taken a few bags of
candy off the shelves to hand
out to the trick-or-treaters, and
the takers did come: most
without costume, some as
groups of adults, many asking
for many extras to give to a
dozen relatives at home, and
most importantly, many without
any good spirits or ‘apprecia-

words-

  What is the dole mentality?

tion. If their attitude had to be
summed up in a single sen-
tence, it wouldn’t ‘be, “Trick or
treat!”, butrather, “OK, where’s
the free stuf .” Halloween was,
for them, just an extra handout
day. , .

What is the “dole mentality”?
It is something that can be
described effectively by another
store _ I worked at - in

Wilkinsburg. Many customers I

in this store looked at me with
scorn that I was taking “their
job,” (i.e., the white man who
supposedly has everything
already, taking the job of the
struggling black man) despite
the fact that in the time I was
there, countless Wilkinsburg

‘residents were hired and then

fired for lack of performance

and/or honesty, and also that

many of theseindividualis said
out loud that they would not go
to the lengths that I did to hold
on to this minimum-wage
employment.

What is the “dole mentality”?
It can be shown in another
aspect of this particular job.
This Uni-Mart would take in,
on the average day, about $100
in food stamps. The food stamp
program, you see, was launched
nationwide in the ‘60s on the
knowledge that it is necessary
for workers to have a good diet
in order to compete successful-

ly. The customers I waited on A

obviously appreciated this need
to have a good diet: at least
half of these customers", using a
variety of techniques to get
around the law, would attempt
to use these food stamps to pur-
chase cigarettes, or worse,
attempt to exchange their
stamps for cash which could
purchase other drugs besides
tobacco.

What is the “dole. mentality”?
It is the psychology that drove
the responses these individuals
gave me when I attempted
(legally) to block these purchas-
es. These customers would
complain as if I had somehow
interfered with a right of theirs!
As far as they were concerned,

these food stamps were theirs
do with what they wanted
(including buy non-food prod-
ucts), and no one could tell
them otherwise. One person
told me that since I wouldn’t let
him use his food stamp to pur-
chase drug paraphernalia, I
wasn’t “supporting the commu-
nity.” :

More than any of these defin-
itions, this “mentality” can be
summed up in a general theme.
The more someone receives
something for free, the more
they become not only accus-
tomed to it, but set in the belief
that they have a right to what-
ever they are getting. The fact

that most everything exists in a_

balance, and that for everything
you take, someone somewhere
is giving, becomes non-notice-
able in this mindset. So when I
tell the trick-or-treaters that
they won’t get anything if they

don’t dress up, I’m not being —

the greedy corporate yuppie:
I’_m trying to get them away

_ from a certain mentality. Throw

on some lipstick and say you’re
RuPaul, but for chrissake. at
least try.

I have actually known people
who were on welfare who did
try and get off it with varying
degrees of success, so I am not
insensitive to the plights of the
destitute. But I’ve also heard
too many people say out loud in
no uncertain terms that they
have no problem with the con-
cept of living off others. And
where it has almost become a
joke that the elderly tell to their

young the trials that they went

through to survive “when I was
your age,” the joke will be on
this country, when today’s par-
ents talk to their grandchildren.
“When I-was your age, I could
have worked, but since I got

paid to sit on my butt anyway.’
why should I have?" is an idea,
I've heard all too many times.

THAT is the “dole mentality."

P The presiden-

Evan tial primaries are

out the worst in people. That’s
why each man who yearns to be

primaries. He knows the awe

pride America has in displaying
democracy to the world. The
presidential elections are
America. It’s the day when
almost one-ﬁfth of eligible vot-

If the University of Pittsburgh
wants to improve its public
image, it could begin by modi-
fying its relations with its own
faculty and staff. What is some-
how overlooked is that the uni-
versity’s employees and their
family and friends are a healthy
portion of “the public.”

Besides ‘ losing our
Hea1thAmeiica benefit, etc., the
tuition benefit we have tradi-
tionally received is now being
debated. Pitt could stand up for
us, saying to all and sundry,
“Our employees work hard in
our classrooms, in our laborato-
ries, in our kitchens, in our
offices, etc. They deserve this
benefit, and the University is
going to do everything in its

"power to find a way for this

tuition remission to remain.”
However, the University is
notorious for not standing up to
anybody in defense of its facul-
ty and staff.

The average secretary in the
private sector receives about
$5,000 more yearly than a Pitt
secretary. Still, there is a debate
about “earning” tuition for our
children. We have already
earned the tuitioncosts in more
than money. I am not exaggerat-
ing when I say we have earned
it in blood, sweat and tears.

I have honestly been in awe
of the University of Pittsburgh

since I visited the campus when —

I was seven. But whatkind of
miracle will it take before Pitt
can acknowledge and give
respect to the section of “the
public” that is working here?

against violence in Hollywood?

Pete Wilson: He finally decid-
ed to run. His stance against
affirmative action won him
many enemies. However, they’re

tion policy is unpopular among
illegal immigrants, they won’t be

After the primaries, one person
will emerge as the Republican
nominee for President. Clinton is
reeling from Whitewater; how-
ever, Americans love an under-
dog because they make more
moriey, and Clinton loves the
underdog position (as well as
many other positions). The
Republicans will attack Clinton
hard, but Americans will turn on
them if they’re too rough.
They’ll be perceived as bullies,
which isn’t_ far from the truth.

This will be a close election, so ’

fulﬁll your civic duty and place
your ‘bets. Don’t bother voting.
The real quality of a democracy
is its acceptance of the entrepre-
neuiial spirit. And what symbol-
izes that better than the possible
windfalls from gambling?

It seems as if The Pitt News

has recently become desperate
for columnists in the opinions

portion of the paper- Both con-_

servative and liberal view-
points ﬂood this page in a way
both immature and unprofes-
sional.

Gordon Sheaffer, University
Democrat, had the right idea
when he announced that “com-
plaining about the other side
leads people nowhere,” but
only after calling members of
the GOP “overweight hillbil-
lies who think they are militia
men.” ~

Matt Mills claimed in the
Sept. 19 issue that “[liberals]
don’t care nearly as much as
conservat_ives.” Mills also
pointed out that, “conserva-
tives tend to be more educat-
ed.” Did Mills forget about
David Duke and other self-pro-
claimed racists that consider
the conservative party their
party? .

The solution to this name-
calling and high-school like
journalism is simple. “Quit
complaining,” as Wednesday’s

editorial suggested. Try focus--

ing more on issues that are
interesting and thought—pro-
voking. We all have different
ideas about politics. We don’t
need a college newspaper to
tell us that. The columnists
should try to use their ideas in
a more educated manner and
stop The Pitt News cat fight.
Before it was funny. Now it’s

implanted
Mikﬁ several ques-
Kovak tions inside
my head,

which is tough‘to do consid-
ering my complete lack of
functioning brain cells.

Why does Pitt run on every
third down? . ’

This answer is simple.

Pitt converted that one
draw in the second quarter.
Remember when,Demetrius
Harris almost broke that run
and managed to gain a first
down? The other 38 times
Pitt tried the draw on third
down they failed, but that
doesn’t matter;

Also, there is the fact that
Pitt is deep at offensive line.
Even without Reggie Thomas
and Tony Orlandini, the other
three linemen on the roster
mow down defenses like a
steam locomotive. .

Where was the double team
on Terry Glenn?

Okay, even though Glenn
set Ohio State records with
253 yards and four touch-
downs, Panther defensive _
coordinator Chuck Driesbach
wanted to contain Ohio State
tight end Rickey Dudley.
They did an excellent job
holding Dudley to one catch
for 17 yards. .

When is Denorse Mosley
returning ? .

Nobody knows. According
to head coach Johnny Majors,
Mosley is doubtful for‘
Saturday’s game against

» Virginia Tech. According to

most people, the Pitt sec- '
ondary is doubtful without
him. -

Who gives up the biggest ‘
plays on defense?

Daryl Cash. Despite good
efforts against great receivers,
Cash does not possess the
speed to stay with top
receivers. The last couple
weeks Cash has been burned
more than Fire Marshall Bill.

Exactly how many intercep-
tions has John Ryan thrown
over the last two games?

Well, there were five
against Texas and three
against Ohio State. Five plus

For the first time in a month
the Lady Panthers volleyball
team got to spend the weekend at
home in Pittsburgh. But the con-
fines of the Fitzgerald Field
House were not as quaint as they
had hoped. -

“When we are playing good,
we’re great, but when we’re not
things aren’t so good,” coach
Cindy Alvear said. ,

Pitt came into the weekend
with a 4-6 record and faced
American University Saturday in
the ﬁist of two weekend matches.
American brought a 7-3 mark
into Saturday’s contest against

_ the Lady Panthers.

Pitt got a much needed win in
three straight games, 15-7, 15-6
and 15-2. Jennie Driscoll had 10
kills for the Lady Panthers while
Sarah Mikla added eight kills and
a .615 hitting percentage on the
day. 1

In Sunday’s match against
Texas Tech the Lady Panthers
weren’t as successful. Pitt fell to
the Lady Red Raiders "in another
five-garne match 15-10, 13-15,
15-6, 10-15 and 11-15. This was

The usual stars were out for
Pitt against Tech. Jennie Driscoll

had 19 kills, 10 blocks and a .359

Sara Mitchell had 19 kills while
Sarah Mikla added 15.

 

“It is really hard to explain a
loss like the one to Texas Tech,”

Alvear said. “When you outstat a '

Two years ago it was receiver
Joey Galloway who scorched the
turf of Pitt Stadium for three
touchdowns as the Buckeyes
romped a helpless Panther squad
63-28.

This year it was junior wideout
Terry Glenn who scorched the
turf of Pitt Stadium for four
touchdowns as the Buckeyes
romped an improved Panther
squad 54-14.

To go along with the four
touchdowns, Glenn repeatedly
ran through a depleted and help
less Pitt secondary to a school-
record 253 yards on nine recep-
lions.

“I was surprised for a minute
[that I was so wide open],” Glenn
said. “I don’t know what it was, I
was out there and I was just in a
zone.” , ‘ \

‘‘He’s backed up two players
that are starting in the NFL,” said
John Cooper, OSU’s head coach.

“I’ve always felt if he played in

Glenn’s first reception of the

Mosley, out with an ankle injury,
Hoying took advantage of the
Panthers’ inexperienced secondary.
Hoying threw for 296 yards and a per-
sonal-best five touchdowns.

And where Hoying left off, his back-
up quarterbacks picked up. Ohio
State’s three quarterbacks combined
for 421 yards. The Buckeyes punished
the Panthers for 636 total yards, while
converting 10 of 13 key third—down
conversions.

The key to 4J)SU’s offense, however,
was tailback Eddie George. George, a
6—foot-3, 230-pound senior, added to
his Heisman Trophy resume as he ran
for 122 yards on 24 carries. In three
games George has rushed for 433
yards and four touchdowns. OSU’s
behemoth offensive line, which aver-
ages 6-4, 295 pounds, plowed over
Pitt’s defense all day, and allowed

‘George-to seemingly do whatever he

wanted.

“With George having the success he
has had so far, I think they have to

°From page 10

With three minutes left in the
ﬁrst quarter, Hoying found Glenn
in the end zone once again.
Glenn did the work, snatching
the 12-yard pass with a full
extension in the right side of the
end zone. The touchdown gave
the Bucks a 14-7 lead.

Glenn was fairly quiet in the
second quarter, catching three
balls for 41 yards. But he made
up for it in the third.

On OSU’s first drive of the
second half, Hoying threw 36
yards to Glenn for another touch-
down. The pair then connected
on the two—point conversion that
gave the Buckeyes a 28-14
advantage.

At the 4:49 mark, the two con-
nected for a 61-yard touchdown
play. ,

“I saw Buster [Tillman] run
their cornerback [Anthony
Dorsett] off and I was just wide
open waiting for the ball to
come,” Glenn said.

It was Glenn’s ﬁnal play of the
game, and when he was done, he
hadn’t realized what he had
accomplished.

“They told me that I broke a
couple records,” Glenn said.
“And I was kinda proud about
that. It’s an honor to hold a
record after all the great receivers-
that have been here.”

The record was held by Gary
Williams, who had 13 receptions
for 220 yards against Florida
State in 1981.

As the Buckeyes get into the
meaty part of their schedule, they
will need Glenn to produce the
way he did against the Panthers.

“He makes a lot of things hap-
pen, he goes up for the ball. I
think we’ve seen just a little
glimpse of what he can do for
us,” said running back Eddie
George.

With the numbers he put up
against Pitt, it’s easy to tell the
Panther defensive backs only
caught a glimpse of Glenn as he
ran past them.

While OSU’s offense clicked on all
cylinders, Pitt’s offense was inept.
Quarterback John Ryan increased his
Big East—leading interception total to
11 after he threw three more. Ryan
finished the day with 182 yards as he
completed 14 of 23 passes and one
touchdown. Ryan,

Glenn mariaged to break away after
the defenders ran into each other.
Glenn trotted in the rest of the way for
a 75-yard touchdown. The Buckeyes
only needed two plays and 40 seconds
for that strike.

But Pitt bounced back the next pos-
session. After

Two of Ryan’s interceptions came in
the first half, which ironically, was a

I totally different ball game for Pitt.

Although it’s not indicative in the
final score. the first 30 minutes the
Panthers were actually in the game.

OSU drew first blood on its second
possession of the game when Hoying
hit Glenn down the middle. From each
side two Pitt defensemen converged

ed with Jells on a quick slant up the
middle. Jells did the rest as he kicked
his track speed into overdrive for a
24-yard touchdown sprint. ‘That was
Jells’ sixth touchdown of the season,
which leads the Big East. For the
game Jells caught seven passes for 91
yards, and in the process broke Pitt’s
all-time reception record which was
previously owned by Dwight Collins.
J ells now has 137 career receptions.

- After freshman kicker Chris

game was tied at 7.

The Buckeyes marched right back to
take the lead. Set up by two Sualua

connection struck again. Hoying rock-
eted a pass to the right side of the end
zone which looked to be incomplete,

yards down field. Then Ryan ran a bootleg and found
Butler again, this time at OSU’s 3-yard line. Patton did the
rest as he swept right for a short touchdown jaunt with
11:26 left in the second quarter.

Ohio State began to move the ball with authority again,
but Anthony Dorsett picked off Hoying’s pass in the end
zone. It was Dorsett’s second interception of the game.

Pitt was in position to take its first lead, but soon after
the Panthers got the ball, they gave it away when Ty
Howard intercepted Ryan’s pass, which was intended for
backup quarterback Matt Lytle who was playing tight end.

OSU marchedydown to the 3-yard line, but Pitt made an
impressive goal line stand to hold the Buckeyes to a field
goal.

“In our terminology, we felt like we let them live too long
in the first half,” Cooper said.

Down 17-14 with under 2:00 remaining in the half, Ryan
tossed his second interception on the third play of the
drive. OSU moved the ball to Pitt’s 22-yard line with three
seconds left, and Josh Jackson kicked a 39-yarder to give
the Buckeyes a 20-14 lead going into the half.

“The rest is history, we just got blown out in the second
half,” Ryan said.

To make matters worse for the Panthers, they also lost
two offensive linemen to an already thin line. Both center
Reggie Thomas and right tackle Tony Orlandini went down
with sprained right knees. Majors said they are probably
out indefinitely.

The Panthers will have to regroup quickly because they
face their first Big East foe next weekend when Virg.nia
Tech visits Pitt Stadium. Virginia Tech beat Miami 13-7
Saturday.

“My biggest concern right now is the exhibition season IS

‘From page 11

over.” Majors said. “The most important thing right now is '

the confe-rence.”

receivers for not running pre-
cise routes. But eight intercep-
tions in two games looks bad.
Another performance like this
against Virginia Tech and peo-
ple will be saying, “Fare thee
well.” to Ryan, and “Hello, I
love you,” to Pete Gonzalez.
Eight is enough and we’re not
gonna take it any more.

Will Gonzalez start
Saturday?

No.

Should 05 U running back
Eddie George be considered
for the Heisman trophy?

Right now, George should be
mentioned in the same breath
as Leeland McElroy of Texas
A&M and Keyshawn Johnson
of USC as the frontrunners.

George has been amazing
this season. Against Pitt,
George dominated the game
and ran for 122 yards in less
than three quarters. With his
200—yard performance against
Washington and his 100-yard
performance against Boston
College, George ranks as col-
lege football’s most underrated
player.

Is Ohio State the best team
in the Big Ten?

Yes. If anybody listens to the
Sports Journal on WPTS, you
heard my bold prediction
before the OSU—Washington
game. I said the Buckeyes
would win the national cham-
pionship.

The Buckeyes have played
three quality opponents to this
point and have thoroughly
dominated the competition.
They will breeze through the
Big Ten this year and play
undefeated USC in the Rose
Bowl. Their skill players are
the best in the country.

What is a Buckeye ?

A buckeye is any North
American shrub or tree of the
genus Aesculus or the large
nutlike seed from these shrubs
or trees.

Why was Billy West on the
cover of the program?

If I’m not mistaken, West is
sidelined with a separation of
the shoulder and did not play
against Ohio State.

Whoever placed him on the
program cover should be sued.
When I looked at the cover I
automaticallyassumed that
West would play, but maybe
the coaching staff used this as
a decoy against Ohio State. It
worked, if you judge the awe-
some rushing performance that
Pitt put up against the
Buckeyes.

How many more days until
Midnight Madness ?

Twenty, which, ironically, is
the amount of interceptions
Ryan will throw by the sixth
game at his current pace.

Mike Kovak is the Asst. Sports
Editor for The Pitt News.

°From page9 highest total in Pitt history. She
also had 16 kills and a .325 hit-
ting percentage in the loss, but
she is not concemed about stats.
“I felt good playing, but I do
not wony about the numbers too
much,” Taiara said. “I hated los-

mance. She is motivated, she
wants it badly, and she keeps
raising her level of performance.”

Tarara had 29 digs in the ﬁve-
game loss, which is the fourth

ing, but we have to learn from
tough matches. We are still work-
ing and growing as a team"
Tarara has not let her youth
affect the goal of the team.
Instead, she has learned from the
veterans and remained focused.

‘‘It’s different on the court in
terms of freshmen and upper-
classmen. We are equal on the
court, but I can say that the
juniors and seniors have made it
a lot easier for me so far this
year."
