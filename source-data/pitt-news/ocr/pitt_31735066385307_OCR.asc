.elects

new
officers

By Adam W. Richter
Staff

Jim Venturella of Sigma Chi
was elected Interfraternity Coun-
cil president on Tuesday evening.
He will replace current IFC presi-
dent Chuck Farinella on Jan. 26.

Farinella said Venturella is ”the
best man for the job.” He said
that one of VentureIla’s goals,
good community relations, is vi-
tal for the IFC.

”The community should be our
ally, not our enemy,” Farinella
said.

According to Venturella, the
fraternities receive a lot of un-
deserved bad publicity and he

wants to change this.

”We’ve had a lot of bad pub-
licity in the news, and there are
stereotypes about drinking... I'd
like that to change,” Venturella
said. ”There’s no other organiza-
tion on campus that raises as
much money as we do for chari-
ty,” he added.

Rush should also be increased,
said Venturella. ”It helps the
whole [G reek] system not only to
get quality men, but also a large
number [of rushees].” He ex-
plained that this is a part of his
overall campaign to better the
Greek system.

In addition to the election of
Venturella, the IFC electeda new
internal vice president, external
vice president, treasurer and
secretary to take office next term.
These five officers make up the
IFC Executive Board.

Internal Vice President-elect
Jerome O'Rourke of Delta ‘Tau
Delta said that although this
year's rush was the best one in
four years, he is also interested in
increasing rush.

’’I think as soon as we're satis-
fied with ourselves, we're dead,”
he said,.adding that rush has to
keep expanding.

Paul Uhlman of Phi Gamma
Delta was elected external vice
president.

Newly elected treasurer Ben
Leff, of Sigma Alpha Mu, said he
plans to help the IFC receive
more funding from the Student
Government Board Allocations
Committee.

’’I plan, as treasurer, to attack
the Allocations Committee to
make sure we get our fair share
of all the student activities

The final tallying of votes for
the Student Government Board
elections ended at approximate-
Iy 9:15 p.m. yesterday. Kent Bal-
dauf was elected president by
1,219 votes.

The results for Board members
were: ' J

Julie Shepard — 857 votes

C. Harper Watters — 856 votes

Anastasia Kawalec — 738 votes

Sandra Woods — 679 votes

EIissa'Klein —— 605 votes

Robyn Dion — 600 votes

Jill Phillips —- 595 votes

Justin Lawhead — 395 votes

The two candidates not elect-
ed to the Board were Eric Sos--
sman with 373 votes and Jeff
Nichols with 370 votes.

”I am in just a total state of
shock. I'm shaking. I'm thorough-
Iy excited, and as soon as we can,
I want to get started,” said newly
elected Board member Julie
Shepard.

”First of all I want to work with
Kent. I know he's got some good
ideas for the new Board. I want
to make sure that when we get
things going that they are going
on the right track. Hopefully with
the two of us working together,
with his good ideas and his good
experience, that will really get a
lot of us going right from the very
start, because I think that's what
is most important,”said Shepard.

C. Harper Watters said,”Obvi-
ously a lot of people put a lot of
trust in me. .

’’In this office I want to do the
best I can for the students. Right
now I'm more than willing to
hear what the students have to
say and start working on what
they want done."

Jill Phillips, also a new member
of the Board, said ’’I feel great.
The first thing I want to do is get
the allocations program straight-
ened out. Then I'm going to start
talking to people about my plat-
form. I want to start dealing with
the Student Health Service be-
cause that is the quickest
achievement.”

The voting polls closed at 6:00
p.m. yesterday, and the votes
were tabulated at 7:00 p.m.

Sources leak information on Bush appointment 0

WASHINGTON (AP) ~ Pres-
ident-elect George Bush has

. tapped feisty Gov. John Sununu

as his chief of staff, sources say,
a signal of change after his first
two top appointments went to
Reagan administration veterans.
Bush's transition co-chairmen,
Craig Fuller and Robert Teeter,
announced a raft of additions to
the transition team‘ yesterday.
They also told reporters that all
transition staff members would
be required to sign an ethics form
pledging them not to leak infor-
mation and to avoid the appear-
ance of conflicts—of-interest.
Asked about Bush's decision to

I make Sununu chief of staff, Fuller

said he had raised the issue with
the vice president Wednesday.

”Let them know [that] when I
am ready to make an announce-
ment, they'll hear it from me,”
Fuller quoted Bush as saying. But
Fuller said he did not know
whether Bush had made the de-
cision.

In Concord yesterday, Sununu
did not deny reports that he will
become chief of staff. At a news
conference, he refused to confirm

the reports, saying any word
would have to come from Bush.

”A request isn't a request until
the tall, thin guy sings,” he said.

Other top staff positions were
announced earlier in the day.
They were C. Boyden Gray,
counsel; Fred Fielding, director of
the office of the vice president-
elect; Chase Untermeyer, person-

nel, and Sheila Tate,
spokeswoman.

The vote on the ”declaration of

abstentions. It came after a vote
on related amendments to the Es-

also interested in increasing
Board participation in the IFC. ’’I
would like to continue the trend
of last year's board, that the en-
tire board participate in the ac-
tions of the IFC,” he said.

The office of secretary was
filled by David Bennet of Alpha
Epsilon Pi, who said that he was
interested in ”the growth of the
Greek community.

”Let’s form an identity, so that
when non—Greeks come to Pitt,
they want to be a part of us —
they think we're something spe-
cial, and we all know that's the
truth.”

Farinella said that the choices
made in the election were out-
standing. ”Jim Venturella did not
run uncontested because of apa-
thy. That wasn’t the issue. It was
because he was the best man for
the job.”

Meetings

Farinella also stated that the IFC
board will be controlled by off-
the-hill fraternities. Only two hill
fraternities, Sigma Chi and Delta
Tau Delta, are represented on the
IFC Executive Board.

In addition to the different sizes
of the fraternities represented,
Farinella also said the Executive
Board would consist of members
of hill fraternities, off—hill fraterni-
ties and no-house fraternities.

The new officers will take
office around Jan. 16, at the Year

Smokers kick the habit for a day

Wednesday. ”You can be a
smoker and work here; you just
can't do it here."

PENNSYLVANIA (AP) ~— Some
Pennsylvania smokers joining in
the 12th annual Great American
Smokeout Thursday can trade
their habit for apples, candy, tur-
key dinners and headless
matches.

Or, they can just do as their
employers suggest and stop
smoking for their own good. At
Jefferson» Park Hospital in
Philadelphia, Thursday marks the
start of a smoke—free policy ban-
ning all smoking in the hospital.

”|t's 100 percent no smoking,”
spokeswoman Jean Stanger said

That's the situation already for
smokers at Bell of Pennsylvania
in Philadelphia, where em-
ployees for months have had to
puff away outside if they wanted
a cigarette.

Representatives of U.S. Health-
care, a health maintenance or-
ganization with members in six
East Coast states, will trade apples
for cigarettes with smokers trying

to quit at two sites in Philadelphia
as well as one in suburban Ard-
more as the American Cancer So-
ciety works to get the nation's 50
million nicotine addicts to kick
the habit.

According to Amy Tremoglie,

a spokeswoman for the Delaware
County unit of the American
Cancer Society, several compa-
nies are holding raffles and offer-
ing free turkey dinners for the
departments with the highest per-
centage of smokers who quit
”cold turkey” for the day.

Pa lotto machine malfunctions

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The
machine used for drawing Penn-
sylvania's Super 7 lottery mal-
functioned Wednesday, dropping
two numbered balls onto the
floor, lottery official Michael
Keyser said.

Keyser said a spring-loaded
door on the chute used in pick-
ing the numbers failed to auto-
matically shut, allowing the balls
21 and 38 to fall to the floor.

A security official shut the door
with his hand before four other
balls — numbers 2, 58,65 and 59
— dropped onto the floor, Keys-
er said.

The drawing, which was for a
jackpot worth at least $7 million,
was stopped and three lottery
officials were consulted. The offi-
cials decided the numbers drawn
were valid, Keyser said.

critics of the report for 25
years, and they know every-
thing that could possibly have
happened," said SOB Presi-
dent Craig Jackson who has
been working on organizing
this event since January of last
year.

Jackson said that these
speakers do not believe the
Warren Commission's report
that a single bullet killed the
president. He explained, for
example, that Dr. Wecht be-

lieves that there was more
than one assassin. Some of
these critics.also believe that
the assassination may have
been an attempt at a coup, ac-
cording to Jackson. '

PPC lecture chairwoman
Lynette Wellington warned
that no one who attends this
seminar should expect an-
swers which cannot be
provided.

”When the series is over, no
one is going to walk away say-
ing, ‘Now I know who killed

him.’ It is designed to help

' people come to their own con-
clusions,” said Wellington.
' Despite attempts by the PPC
to have advocates of the War-
ren Commission speak this
weekend,‘ members of the
commission refused to attend,
perhaps because they are
afraid of looking bad, Welling-
ton said.

”There is so much con-
troversy over the Warren
Commission that they are
afraid of getting shot down.

Jackson believes this event is
being allowed to happen now
because it is the 25th anniver-
sary of JFK’s death and be-
cause Kennedy has been in
the spotlight lately, due to'"the
presidential campaign in
which both Gov. Michael
Dukakis and Sen. Dan Quayle
compared themselves to the
slain leader.

Jackson also stressed the
event's importance to those
who were not around in 1963.

”This will give students a
chance to relive what hap-
pened. It’s something in histo-
ry which stands out so vividly,
and this event will allow those
of us not born [at that time] to
be a part of it,” he said.

”The assassination was a
passionate event to have hap-
pened to the nation, and now
is as good a time as any to re-
educate the people who
weren't around then on the
importance of the issue," said

The Pitt Program Council

Ridge considers race for Pa governor in 1990

By Jeff Barker

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) - Tom
Ridge, a popular northwestern
Pennsylvania congressman con-
sidering running for governor in
1990, acknowledged Wednesday
that his name has come up in
connection with two Bush ad-
ministration Cabinet posts.

Friends of Ridge’s who work
for President-elect George Bush
have told the congressman that
he is ”in the network” as a can-
didate to head the newly-created
Department of Veterans Affairs or
to become secretary of labor,
Ridge said.

But the Republican Ridge

characterized his chances of get-
ting either post as ”remote.”
Members of Bush's transition
team are keeping quiet about
their deliberations.

’ Meanwhile, two other GOP
Pennsylvania congressman were
the subject of speculation about
Bush administration positions,
but neither had been approached
by representatives of the vice
president.

A spokesman for Rep. William
Clinger of Warren County said in
an’interview that he has heard
rumors that Clinger might be
asked to be an ambassador.

But Clinger press aide David
Fuscus said, ”These rumors have
been floating around for some

time.” Even if Clinger were
asked, Fuscus said, the congress-
man would have to think hard
because ”he likes his job a lot.”

Members of the Pennsylvania
congressional delegation also
said there was speculation that
Rep. William Goodling was in
the running for education
secretary.

”We haven't heard about it,”
said Greg Waddell, Goodling’s
press secretary. He said Goodling
was looking forward to his new
position as ranking Republican
on the House Education and
Labor Committee.

Ridge said he heard his name
mentioned in press accounts
about the veterans and labor

”Somehow some of my friends
in Washington found out and
said, ‘What's going on?’ I said, ‘I
don't know,’ and they said my
name is in the network for both
[posts]/’ Ridge said.

”From talking to people around
the Bush campaign, I may well be
considered," he said. ’’I’m ho-
nored that somebody around him
may think that because of my in-
terest and ability, I might be war-
thy of some kind of
consideration."

intelligence program solves problem

Artificial
By Earl Bohn

Associated Press Writer

PITTSBURGH (AP) — Westing-
house Electric Corp. expects to
save $500,000 a year after an ar-
tificial intelligence program
taught the company a thing or
two about making the metal
tubes that contain nuclear fuel in
reactors.

Conventional industrial com-
puter programs, called expert sys-
tems, control production by
applying known rules for making
particular products. Westing-
house fed the computer raw data

T from the production line.

company calls it, ”looks _at its

own performance and says ‘I
produce good tubing or bad tub-
ing, and if I produce bad tubing
using the expert's rules, there's
obviously something missing,’ ”
said researcher Jan Schreurs.

It helped improve a process at
the Blairsville specialty metals
plant in which short, thick zirco-
nium alloy tubing is rolled into
long, thin tubes that hold nuclear
fuel pellets in reactor fuel as-
semblies.

The computer discovered that
the surface quality of tubing did

not depend simply on the tem-
perature of the fluid used to cool
the rolling machine and the alloy,
said Schreurs and Neil Pessall,
another researcher. Another crit-
ical factor was the difference in
coolant temperatures on the day
the rolling machine was calibrat-
ed and on the days of production.

A new rule, derived by humans
using the findings, says the tem-
perature can differ up to 20
degrees Fahrenheit before surface
quality deteriorates. Before, the
weather was creating tempera-

ture differences of 40 degrees.

"This process has been used for
about two decades without ever
anybody coming up with a rule,”
Schreurs said, adding that the rule
”had been there all along” but
lay buried in the myriad facts that
only a computer could sort.

”The computer does the tedi-
ous part of the work, looking at
the same data in a thousand
different says. You can do that on
paper, of course, but people get

very tired of doing that. They try
a few obvious things, but if they
don't find what they're looking
for they give up and forget the
data. The computer doesn't get
tired, and it doesn't forget the
data.”

The rule is expected to bring
about a 1 percent to 2 percent in-
crease in the amount of tubing
that doesn't need reworking or
adjustments, worth about
$500,000 a year in production
cost savings, he said.

Bowl hopes are gone

for several reasons

Well, somebody messed up again. The 6-3 Pitt Panthers
football team, a team with an excellent chance to go 8-3
and be ranked in the top 20 by the end of the season,
won't be able to showcase its talents by appearing in a
postseason bowl game. '

Where does the blame lie? Well, there are a couple of
places.

First of all, you can't look past the whole bowl scenario.
The way everything is set up now, bowl games decide
who will play by the kind of television ratings that a team
can get. For instance, a team like Michigan State (the. same
team that won the prestigious Rose Bowl last season)
would probably bring in a larger television audience than
a team like Pitt (who lost to a not-so-great Texas team in
last year's Bluebonnet Bowl).

‘This might be true, and it is the way of the world. But
you can't possibly look past the Pitt administration. Over
the past fewiweeks, there have been numerous bowl
games represented at Pitt games. It seems that Pitt Athlet-
ic Director Ed Bozik was satisfied with that.

When another bowl game came a—cal|ing, its officials
saw the other bowls in attendance and went seeking other
teams. It seems that Bozik had been leaning towards the
Gator Bowl, which had a larger payoff than any other
prospective postseason game. That means that bowls such
as the Sun and the Independence figured they were out
of the picture and left. Then the Gator Bowl dropped out,
and nobody else was around. Bozik burned his bridges_
and had nothing else to fall back on. That is not the way
of the world. '

A bug to lead future

Forget about your post-election
blues, fat—free Oprah Winfrey, the
Kenhedys, Jack Ruby, Elvis, Ger-
aldo, Sophie Masloff and corrup-
tion in the Catholic church. It's
time for something on the lighter
side of life...

- Just when you thought you
couldn't be bugged anymore,
word is out that, after much
deliberation, a decision will soon
be finalized as to who has
emerged victorious in what just
may be the most grandiloquent
pageant our state has ever hosted.

A pageant whose contestants
are devoid of any artificial embel-
lishments and neglect of the ac-
coutrements of vanity; a contest
where the beauty is simply a con-
sequence of nature. And best of
all, entrants will be judged au
naturel.

Though the only difference be-
tween these beauties and those
on television is that those in the
Miss America contest are capable
of intelligent thought and reason-

ing, the stakes are even higher.

Who will reign, not for a year,

not for a decade, and not even for.

a lifetime —- but perhaps for all
eternity as our state bug?

An estimated 1,000 species of
fireflies gathered, wings buffed,

FRANCES
SANSIG

antennae starched, displaying
their brightest lights for the final
showdown. Which species
would be chosen?

The panel of preliminary
judges consisted of the most pres-
tigious citizens of Pennsylvania.
Most were overqualified to make
even this crucial decision; yet,
they sacrificed time to convene
for this momentous occasion, and
made the final choice, you might
say, on a wing and a prayer.

They were members of the
Senate State Government Com-
mittee.

And why not? The firefly is a
dynamic, harmless little creature,

As the end of the semester
draws near and I celebrate my se-
cond month as an editor, I have
a few things I think should be
said:

0 All of the home games for
football are over, (they've been
over for a week) and I still can't
believe how much it rained. I
figured it rained 16 of 24 quart-
ers. (The only game where it
didn't rain at all was with West

"A” for effort.

knew that these people were
there for the whole game, it was
because I was on the field taking
pictures for the whole game.
While I stood there, fully clothed
and shivering in the downpour,
feeling miserable, the cheer-
leaders were jumping up-and-
down constantly. They're simply
not playing with a‘ full deck.

election when he gave Bush his

and let him become president
and do something before blasting

0 From the election results,
where the highest totals for presi-

generations of Pennsylvanians

sedentary during the day and at
night, prowling for a little after-
dark hanky-panky.

Perhaps it is the embodiment of
these brilliant qualities which has
state lawmakers so enamored
with Photuris Pensylvanica
DeGeer.

According to a source quoted
in an article in a local newspaper,
”These females are wise. They
are sending out signals that lure
in the wimpy males, and they be-
come dinner." Sounds like my
kind of bug. But this irresistibly
luminous Lampryridae is every-
one's kind of bug.

There is a quality to appeal to
everyone, which is what makes
the ubiquitous Miss DeGeer (and
those misters who might survive)
such a viable, across-the-board
candidate for the honor.

Assuming that all this hoopla
didn't arise from a typographical
omission of several letters on a
memo, (maybe it should have
been state budget, not state bug?),
this pageantry of pests will hope-

fully have a positive effect on
Pennsylvanians the world over.

The firefly has never been a
beetle of burden. When was the
last time you heard dad swatting
at one saying, "Those damn
fireflies!"

Finally, a good positive force is
being given the respect it is due.
We should all learn to pay
homage to the state bug.

Science teachers will have a
fresh topic to discuss with stu-
dents. ”What you are looking at,
class, is not just any insect. This
is your state insect." I can hear
the oohs and ahhs!

Parents can put their children
to sleep by telling them tales of
the firefly. ”And Willie, in the
year 1988, history was made
when the Photuris Pensylvanica
DeGeer was chosen as the spe-
cies of our state bug.”

”Have I ever seen one, Mom?"

”No, Willie, I don't believe
you have. But Photuris Pensyl-
vanica DeGeer is everywhere. In
our hearts and in our minds.

Sleep weII,,son.”

Soon, Photuris will be hailed as
the feel-good bug of the year. I
just know it.

The w'rnning.contestant will be
crowned on Nov. 30 by the
Senate.

Only one senator on the Senate
State Government Committee
voted against the critter, saying,
”With all the pressing problems
we have in the General Assem-
bly, I think to deal with a bill like
this really gives disrespect to the
public image of legisIators.”

Lighten up a little, huh?

THE PITT NEws, Thursday, November 17, 1988

First solo single released by
Hector in Paris frontman

By Joan Kane
Staff Writer

Local musicians tend to shy
away from the word ”pop” when
describing their music. Some-
how, the word ”pop” has be-
come synonymous with the word
”commercialized,” which in turn
implies that an artist is selling out
and trying to make an easy buck.
In essence, the word is taboo.

But there’s no easy buck to be
made in the music industry, not
in Pittsburgh at least. And Philip
Harris knows that.

Although Harris will be making
his solo debut Sunday night at the
WPTS Birthday Bash at the
Metropol, he is in no way a
novice to the area's music scene.

For years, Harris was a member
of the now extinct, but ever
popular band, Hector in Paris.

Hector’s demise may have
been somewhat of a surprise to
many of its fans, but Harris ration-
alizes it clearly.

’’It wasn't as much fun any-
more. Instead of hammering it

out, we decided to quit while we

were on top and while we were
all still friends,” he explained.
Hector In Paris was on top, no
doubt. In their heyday, they were
voted ”Best Rock Band of 1987"
by fans and critics in that year’s

’ in Pittsburgh music awards. Hec-

tor also had secured a very large
and loyal following.

That following will inevitably
be interested in the latest projects

of Harris.’

He recently released the single
”Somebody Else’s Dream,”
which is currently in rotation at
WPTS. The song, which Harris
wrote about three years ago,
deals with ”having a bad day and
how people can manipulate you.
It's about being held hostage. It
eventually evolved into a spy
scenario,” he explained.

The record's sleeve, by the
way, neatly depicts this imagery
with a picture of Harris being
held at gunpoint.

Musically, ”Somebody Else's
Dream” is somewhat of a depar-
ture from the Hector in" Paris style
and sound. its melody has a light,
almost mellow quality, while the
lyrics echo through with sub-
stance.

The B-side. ”Goodbye, Good-
bye” is a faster-paced, frolicking
song about leaving home in ord-
er to find something. better, but
not finding it.

’’It’s a vicious cycle,” Harris
joked.

The single hosts a variety of
musicians including Dave Brown
and Scott Griswold of the Dave
Harger group, David Klug, who
played drums with Hector and
now with the Spuds, and Xayne
Berlinski of Bon Ton Roulette.

The diversity of the musicians’
specialities (jazz, dance, rock and
R&B,) proves a point that Harris
stresses: labels don't mean

4 anything.

”The labels that are put on
things, music especially, aren't
that important," he stated.

”My songs are ’pop’ songs, I
guess. I’m not afraid to say it. I'm
not afraid of the word. What does
pop really mean? It’s just a short-
ened form of popular.”

Harris’ songs are accessible
and catchy, so in that sense,
maybe they are pop. But Harris
certainly isn't ”selling out” by
any means.

Check out Philip Harris’ solo
debut Sunday night at the Birth-
day Bash. It's an all-ages celebra-
tion in honor of WPTS’ fourth

birthday. Performing along with
Harris will be the Spuds, Fuse-
box, Thin White Line and The Af-
fordable Floors. The show starts
at 7 p.m. and tickets can be pur-
chased at the door.

The

I nterview
By John Young

Few bands ever realize punk
rock's potential. Husker Du did.
Formed in the early eighties,

the band set out to be the‘

''loudest, fastest group in ‘the
world.'' By the time of their
breakup in January of this year,
they had become much more.
Husker Du fused punk's furious
energy and noisy underpinnings
with pure pop melodies and lyr-
ics that replaced preachiness
with simple, heartfelt glimpses at
themselves and the world
around them.

The results are shown in some
of rock's most varied and origi-
nal albums of the decade: New

Day Rising, Zen Arcade, Candy-

Apple Grey.

creative output was their one-
two punch of songwriters,
guitarist Bob Mould and drum-
mer Grant Hart. Mould was
constantly looking inward and
snarling at the situations he saw.
Hart's songs ran more of the
emotional gamut, from the
romantic sillines of "Books About
U.F.O.'s" to the dark, disturbing
"Pink Turns to Blue."

Hart has been the first of the
band members to release
material since their much talked
about demise. He has released
an album of experimental jam-
ming under the name
Yanamanos and has a more seri-
ous, three-song record out on

C When were the songs on
the 2547 EP written?

A The B-sides were written in
May and the A—side was written
around the time of New Day
Rising. .

0 Really? It's that old?

A Yeah, It was written in
I984, but the band just never
thought to play it.

Q How did you approach
recording the songs? Is it just
you, _or are there other people
on the record?

‘ A I played all the instruments
on this one, and some friends did
some backing vocals. I have a
band together that should be
recording a whole album soon.
Johnny George from the Mag-
nolias is playing bass in it. I play
rhythm guitar.

Q Another project you have
now is Yanamanos.

A Yeah, and it's a departure,
too, like 2541. With
Yanamanos, it's pretty much just
me and some art school‘ friends
just pIayin' around. It's totally
improv. This was the first time
we'd ever picked up instruments
together in five years, and the
record is just the first two songs
we played. It's guitar and drums
and bass. And the optimum
word is ''noise.''

0 Your playing on drums has
always been really distinctive
sounding on your records. It
sounds trebly and sounds as if
you use your cymbals a lot.

A As it turns out, I must use
cymbals a lot more than every-
body else in the world 'cause
I've heard an abundance of
comments on that. I guess I'm es-

sentially more of a jazz stylist '

than what's generally heard. I
think my choice of tool, as far as
drums are concerned, is a big

factor as well. I play old SIinger-
land's and they have a quality
to their sound that's pretty much
unmatched.

Q As far as your songwriting
goes, do you feel it's grown
over the years?

A I think melodically I've — I
hate to use the word matured ——
maybe expanded. A person
should get better at what they're
doing, not that their earlier ef-
forts are dodgy or anything like
that. Hopefully, it becomes more
artistic, and more ideas come
together.

There are no wholly new mu-
sical ideas, just combinations of
existing ones. From there is
where change and progress will
be made in the future. Like reg-

ae fusing with polka or some-
t ing. [Laughs.]

Q You seem to have a lot of
narrative songs that work like
stories.

A They're like a story in that
perhaps they have a movement
in tone to a resolution. The in-
troductions to a song — the title
and the chorus — are more or

differently.
I have to be inspired to write
something by real experiences.

You gotta have a view out of’

your window.

O Speaking ofviews, have
you done any videos for your
new material?

A There's a video for "254l "
that remains in the can, unedit-
ed. Once we get some money
from the record label, we'll think
about doin' that. It'll surface
soon or else some time in the
next ten years, I'm sure.

Q Will you be doing any
touring with your new band?

A Yeah, I think so.

0 Do you usually enjoy
touring?

A It can be done enjoyably.
It can be very frustrating, too,
particularly in the case of a Eu-
ropean tour where you can't
stop and like hang out at I4th
century castles. You kinda want
to do some sight—seeing and
make it vacation-like, but yu
usually can't. Like Bob [Mould]
said, ''All work and no play
makes Jack a dull boy."

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, November T7, T988

 

By Dmitri Ragano
Staff Writer

I once heard someone refer to
the Cynics as the "Adams Fami-
|y" of the Pittsburgh rock scene.
Now I don't remember Uncle
Fester ever tearing into a Stan-
dells cover, but the description
does have merit.

There's something unsavory
about the whole Cynics ex-
perience, not to mention their
trollish looks and rowdy psych-
rock sound. They've been on the
road a lot recently, but they'll be
coming to Graffiti on Nov. 28,
with the Pleasureheads and the
Heretics for one of the day—g|o
druid rituals they periodically
enact

Last June I saw them play to a
gathering of the faithful: a mix of
mods, punks, and other assorted
shady characters who dared to
venture into this Monkees epi-
sode from hell. The crowd was
plenty satisfied, even if they left
without five senses intact.

Euphoria doesn't creep up on
you at a Cynics show, it nails you
flat with a melodic metal thud.
Guitarist Gregg Kostelich breaks
into rash of high-speed riffs. Beki
Smith pounds out a few acid-
laced chords from the organ.
Singer Michael Kostelic bleats
and swivels like Joey Ramone af-
ter too many mushrooms. A few
minutes into the performance the
audience is just treading water on
the heels of the blitzkrieg.

"That's the way a rock and roll
show should be, kind of a spec-
tacle”, says Kastelic. "We try to
work people into some kind of
reaction. Whether they start
dancing or run away screaming,
we don't care."

Associations with the Sixties
are inevitable but somewhat mis-
leading. Cynics albums aren't
suitable for getting metaphysical
in front of the lava lamp. The
songs are quick, noisy, angry and
usually under 3 minutes. The
eerie melodies are framed into
jolts of punk immediacy.

"I think the Cynics are really
more like a rock and roll revival
band not a Sixties revival,” says
Kastelic, "we're bringing back
that passion and the beating of a
real drum, not a machine, not a
keyboard...”

The band draws from in-
fluences of different periods. ''I'm

‘really into mid—fifties and mid-

sixties, especially really obscure
bands," says Smith. ”They have
more aggression and teen en-
thusiasm."

Kastelic’s tastes run a little
more recent. He values the punk
outburst of the Seventies and
Eighties as well as the old stuff.
"I love the whole hardcore
scene... I think it's good that these
kids are getting back to the roots
of rock and roll."

"That's what rock and roll is all
about: passion. It's not about
someone standing up there like
a mannequin, like Gary Newman
or the Pet Shop Boys, and not
even breaking a sweat.”

The Cynics are riding on the
crest of a resurgance of the Six-
ties sound via college radio and

the club circuit. Excellent releases
by the Lyres, the Chesterfield
Kings and Opal have attracted
press attention. The Cynics have
yet to lend such national recog-
nition to the scene, but they're
doing great, grungy records and

some of the best performing‘

you'll find.

And they do have lots of fans,
coming from exotic regions like
Greece and Australia, as well as
Washington County. Their
records _are on the chags in
Western Europe. On this side of
the Atlantic, they've toured Cana-

 
   

da and the South. And they regu-
larly play to big crowds in New
York and Washington.

"It seems to be getting better
every year," says Kastelic. The
band has plans to put together a
new album this winter and, of
course, more touring.

But no matter how bright
prospects are for the Cynics, their
future will always be entwined
with the past.

"l've dedicated my life," Smith
exclaims proudly, "to black and
white, to the Sixties, to bein'
mod."

7 nifehmrre searches for sanity with a power edge

By Tim Azinger

Assistant Showcase Editor

In the world of hardcore rock
’n’ roll, there has come to be a
fine division of styles: those that
play for speed and those that play
for power. .

Knifedance, a crunching quar-
tet from Cleveland, Ohio, has laid
speed aside, opting for gut-
wrenching power to accompany
their diversified lyrics.

Knifedance’s current lineup in-
cludes Tom Dark (lead vocals),
Charlie Ditteaux (bass), Scott
Eakin (guitar) and Ant (drums).

The band had its beginnings

back in early 1985, and since
then has gone through three
drummers and one guitarist.

Who Then Is Sane, released in
1988 on Hit & Run Records, is
Knifedance’s first and only vinyl
product. This four-song, 12-inch
EP contains that powerful, rough
image that the band has staked its
claim on.

Dark and Ditteaux are the only
two members remaining from the
Who Then ls Sane crew, and
Dark feels that the latest rendition
of Knifedance has solidified and
matured their musical abilities.

Knifedance actually had
enough material to put out a full-

length album, but instead chan-
neled their funds into a three-
week tour that took place this
past September.

The tour canvassed the East
coast and a few southern states
and found Knifedance playing
with the likes of such under-
ground moguls as Laughing Hye-
nas, Sonic Youth, Big Black and
Sacred Hate (another Ohio
powerhouse).

Dark classifies Knifedance’s
style as straight-ahead hard rock
with a twinge of punk mixed in
for good measure.

”We’re not about mohawks
and skinheads,” says Dark.

”We’re about playing loud, gut-
level music.”

Dark alludes to the band mem-
bers’ age span, one that covers 15
years between the oldest and
youngest, as a helpful deter-
minant in the band's originality.

Such a varied age range gives
way to a great variety of musical
tastes and influences. When com-
bined, this factor gives Knife-
dance a raw, energetic vigor that
puts them at the forefront of the
power-edge movement.

The songs on Who Then Is

well as around the world.

We are a strange lot. We are
hypocritical when we see other
people doing it, yet in secret we

slyness and secretiveness of the
act.

When I go to make a purchase
of one or several of them at a

‘time, I wear dark sunglasses, a

trenchcoat and a large hat that
will conceal my facial features. I
ask the cashier, who is laughing
at me behind the counter, if she
would put my purchase in a
brown bag.

As soon as I have it, I rush
home to a dark closet where I
take off my haphazard disguise
and root around for the flashlight.
As soon as I find my luminous

friend, I take my purchase out of
the bag and begin to read.

I, and others like me, make up
the ”The Closet Tabloid
Readers”...

Of course, we don't believe
everything that we read, but
damn, that story aboutﬁatan tak-
ing the woman's daughter to the
prom sure sounded like it really
happened. It's also entirely pos-
sible that a man's face could fall
off because he laughed too hard.
Besides, who really resurrected
Elvis anyway? 1

I fear, however, that I and other
closet tabloid junkies are going to
be responsible for the downfall of
modern civilization as we now
know it.

Where are our morals, our
values? What are we teaching to
our children about what we
beheve?

We are a sick lot. We actually
want to read about Satan's prom
date. (What did he wear to cover
his cloven hooves? Did he have
bad breath? Did he try and get to
first base? I really want to know...)

It's not enough that we get to
watch Oprah talk about new hair-
styles or Geraldo getting a broken

nose from Nazi racists. We need
to read stories about aliens and
superhuman feats like how many
lima beans can a man from New
Jersey shove in his face.

The scary part is that we are
large in number. The circulation
of this type of paper is larger than
some metropolitan newspapers
(like The Pitt News).-

So what is the solution to this
problem? They can't make us go
to a remote island somewhere in
the Pacific. They can't ignore us
because we are everywhere. We
are your parents, your neighbors,
your children, your boyfriends
and your girlfriends.

Rehabs! Betty Ford! Hey, wait
a minute, there's an idea. A clin-
ic for tabloid abusers...

The first step would be admit-
ting that we have a problem.

Then we would attend or-
ganized group sessions where we
would talk about our experi-
ences. How we lost our friends

and families because nothing else
mattered more than purchasing
The National Enquirer or The
Weekly World News.

Then the padded room...
where no tabloids are allowed.

Yes, it will be violent. Yes, itwill
be ugly. People will be hurling
themselves against the wall,
screaming for hours. It won't be
pretty, Withdrawal never is.

Then we would be shown pic-
tures. Pictures of bums in the
street who were once affluent
members of society, but because
of an addiction to tabloids, have
fallen from grace. Pictures of
neglected children whose parents
have forgotten them. Pictures of
people pleading for their mates to
return to them.

It would be a slow and painful
process but one that would ulti-
mately be for the best. However,
who could undertake such a dif-
ficult task as setting one of these
clinics up? Who else, but the
master of American morals: Mor-
ton Downey Jr.

It's good to know that we still
have something: we still have
televangelists.

The difficulties of avoiding parking tickets in Oakland

It is extremely difficult to avoid
getting a parking ticket in Oak-
land. Besides facing all the traffic
just to get to campus, and the
struggle to get a space, the real
trouble happens when you return

 

MARK
STAF

to your car to find that you have
received a parking ticket, even
though you have only been gone

a short amount of time. Basical-
ly, it is too easy to get a parking
ticket in Oakland.’

The Pitt News has noticed the
main reason: there are not
enough non-metered spaces
available. ‘ The garages fill up
quickly with the first 10 percent
of the drivers, forcing the rest of
the drivers toiuse the metered
spaces. Brick Brock, the head of
parking at the University of Pitts-
burgh admits, ”There are only ’x'
amount of non-metered spaces
available -and ’x’ amount of stu-
dents that drive.”

The parking meters in turn,
only accept quarters, and only
give two hours of security from a
ticket. That is not enough time for
a lot of students to go to their
classes. Marcia Sanders, a Pitt
sophomore remarks, ”My one
class meets for two hours. Even
if I leave class early, run to—and-
fro, I’m still away for over two

hours. And, nine times out of ten,
I come back to a ticket.”

This is caused by another fac-
tor: The meter maids and police
officers that patrol the area seem
too anxious togive away tickets.
Maggie O'Donnell, a meter
maid, admits, ”I must write a cer-
tain amout of tickets. It's my job.”
An extremely unsympathetic
meter maid, Sandy Fascale
remarked, ”| write sometimes
100 tickets a day. If that meter has
a few minutes left on it, I will go
up the street a little and come
back and write that ticket.”

Jason Makland, a Pitt senior,
notes that he pulled into a space
that he regrets having pulled into.
”I had to drop off a form. I was
only gone five minutes, but when
I came back, my car had already
been towed.”

Craig Towing Company, the
company that does the majority
of the towing, admits that, de-

pending on the day, they will tow

up to 50 cars from the Oakland
area.

As if the problem isn't bad
enough, it just seems to be es-
calating. American School and
University talks about a new
computerized ticketing system for
campus parking control called
Ticketmaster. Ticketmaster will
give tickets the instant that a
meter expires.

This problem should be taken
care of immediately by the
University of Pittsburgh. They
should use some of this year's tu-
ition increase to supplylstudents
and faculty with more spaces, so
that their cars will be close to
campus and free of meter maids
and police officers.

Or the university should push
Pittsburgh Traffic Court to give

some kind of ticket immunity to
students.

At least, the university should
push Pittsburgh Traffic Court to
extend meter times to four hours
instead of two.

The problem of students and I

faculty getting too many tickets is
directly due to the fact that meters
do not provide enough time, the
university doesn't provide
enough non-metered spaces for
its students and meter maids are
expected to provided quotas of
tickets to their superiors. The
University of Pittsburgh should
take some immediate action. It is
bad enough that tuition is so

high, but parking costs an arm

and a leg as well.

Mark Staf is a columnist for The
Pitt News;

Bush was the clear choice of a conservative America

George Bush must be smiling.
Mainstream America didn't let
him down.

Silver spoon and all, George
”The Wimp" Bush is grinning all
the way to the steps of the White
House, much tothe disgust of ev-
ery bleeding liberal, self-
proclaimed or closet, in the Unit-
ed States of America.

George Bush, vice president in
an administration that is, accord-
ing to Mike Dukakis, ”like a dead

‘ fish rotting at the head,” defeat-

ed Dukakis in a vote by the
people.

He won the election» with his
army of mudslinging machine
gunners doing the job for him -
his campaign managers, say
Bush's bleeding opponents.

Of course, it had nothing to do
with what George Bush stands
for. I

He won while riding the back
of Willie Horton, the furloughed
ghost whom Bush assisted in
haunting Mike Dukakis every day
and night since the Democratic
National Convention, since the

-‘ r-«-»msa~;va;:~at   T

  

TOMAS
DANYLUK

day when every soul in Atlanta's
Omni first noticed the silver
spoon sticking out of the vice
president's mouth.

Of course, the victory had
nothing to do with what Bush, a
last-ditch racist according to the
Dukakis campaign, stands for.

He won because he was able
to successfully hide his millstone,
Dan Quayle, in the creases of
America -— the small cities and
towns where most folks have

more relevant issues on their vot-
ing agendas than day care, wel-
fare and other public assistance
giveaways — instead of parading
him in front of the Quayle-
hunting press, where the Nation-
al Guard would undoubtedly
again become the focal point of
the election.

He won because Michael
Dukakis waited until the waning
moments before Nov. 8 to admit
that yes, indeed he was a liberal,
instead of coming out with the
bad news right away.

But only... only in the mold of
the great Harry Truman, and the
blindly worshipped John F.
Kennedy is Michael Dukakis a
liberal, you see. Not in the mold
of Kennedy's cowardly brother
Teddy, nor in that of George
McGovern.

Of course, the labeling George
Bush didn't win because the
American people wanted nothing
to do with another free-spending
”We welcome you with open
arms” liberal in the Oval‘Office.
Jimmy Carter had made very sure

of that.

So why did Michael Dukakis
choose Lloyd Bentsen, a highly
conservative Democrat as his
running mate? to win Texas? to
win the South? to inform the pre-
sumedly naive public that Quayle
was no Jack Kennedy?

Sen. Bentsen differed with
Dukakis on nearly as many issues.
as Bush did. Agreed with Bush on
a lot of them. So what would
Dukakis want with someone as
conservative, as silver-spoonish,
as Bentsen? If he was going to go
that far, why not choose Ricky
Schroeder?

Because Dukakis needed a link
with America, the real America,
that's why. He has nothing in
common with the mainstream.
He was already deeply in touch
with all the faction groups that
support the neo-Democratic party
— the pro-abortion groups, the
gay rights groups, the no-nukes,
et al. J

Anything lying on the side of
the main road was on the side of
Michael Dukakis.

Bentsen was his only hope,
Bentsen, one of the few remain-
ing conservative Democrats.

But why, the American people
thought, would you want a tick-
et disguised in conservatism
when you could have the real
thing?

Thus, a landslide was born.

Iran-contra. Noriega. James
Watt. The American people
didn't agree with Dukakis that
they were a fair straight-up swap
for peace and prosperity.

And the only thing that has
really been rotting at the head is
the Democratic Party's quest for
the White House.

Pitt looks for fifth—straight win at N. C. State

By Vince Carey
Sports Editor

Just a few days before one of
their toughest games of the year,
the Pitt Panthers (6-3) found out
that no matter what they do in
their last two games, a bowl
game looks to be out of the pic-
ture. Still, they are going to have
to regroup in a hurry as they trav-
el to Raleigh, NC. to take on the
N.C. State Wolfpack (6-3-1).

”We just have to go out and
play like nothing else has hap-
pened,” freshman defensive end
Mike Chalenski said. ”The team
knows that we have a couple of
tough games ahead of us and we
can't get caught up in things go-
ing on around us.”

The task at hand will not be a

simple one. The Wolfpack can be
an explosive offensive team, and
up until last week, their defense
was tops in the nation. Last week,
they used a last—second field goal
by Damon Hartman to tie Duke,
43-43.

”They are really an interesting
offensive football team,” Pitt
coach Mike Gottfried said. ”They
have a couple packages. When
the one quarterback [Shane
Montgomery] plays, they are like
a power running team and a pass-
ing team. When the other quar-
terback [Preston Poag] comes in,
they turn into an option team.
They really present you [with]
practice problems. You really ar-
en’t sure how to prepare. They
are a team [that] uses a couple of
different quarterbacks during the

front-runner for Big
East tournament title

The Pitt women's volleyball
team will host the seventh annu-
al Big East Volleyball Champion-
ship at Fitzgerald Field House on
Saturday and Sunday.

The Lady Panthers will go into
the tournament as strong favorites
to capture the title in front of the
home crowd.

Pitt will be led by All—American
candidate Denise Frawley and
powerful newcomer Julie Sheils
who form the dynamic duo of
outside hitters in the east.

Frawley will be out to show the
opposition why she is considered
the Big East's best player while
Sheils will attempt to strike fear
into their hearts with a heavy too
spin serve.

Kelly Matheis is another
weapon in the Pitt arsenal that the
opposition will have to fend off.

Pitt's offense will be run by the
sweet setting Jenelle Lantagne
who has emerged as arguably the
East's best setter this season.

Expected to key the Pitt defense
will be a triumvirate of middle-
blockers — Nora Mulvihill, Dee
MacAulay and Michele Adam-

‘By Don Boyd

Staff Writer

The Pitt women's volleyball is

eagerly awaiting the start of the
Big East Volleyball Champion-
ships this weekend.

Not only are they hosting the
tournament at Fitzgerald Field
House on Saturday and Sunday,
they are favored to capture their
fourth conference crown in the
tournament's seven year ex-
istence.

The Lady Panthers go into the
tournament with a 20-8 record
and will be out to avenge their
upset loss to Providence in the
Big East finals, last season.

Lori Silk who has contributed
to the Pitt cause from numerous
positions on the court noted as
much when she said, ”Tradition.

while MacAulay will often per-
form her passing magic from the
back row.

The contingent from Syracuse
University (27-12) is ‘capable of
providing stiff competition for the
Pitt women. Expected to play a
key role for the Lady Orange is
Teri Hibner, the 1987 Big East
North Division Player-of-the-
Year, who this season lead the
squad in kills (278) and digs
(277). Making Syracuse more of
a threat is their imposing height.
They start four players over six
feet tall.

Georgetown is another team
which has interesting capabilities.
The Lady Hoyas turned in one of
their best seasons ever (23-10) for
second—year coach Nila-Toribio
Straka. One of the keys to a
strong showing by this up—and—
coming team will be the play of
senior Cathy Taylor.

Another Big East team which
garnered 20 wins this season is
the University of Connecticut. It
is the third time in school history
that the Huskies have reached
that plateau. However, this sea-
son was the first time they have
ever won nine consecutive
matches. A player to watch for an
indication of how Connecticut is

At Pitt, we have a tradition. We
are expected to win the Big East
title, every year. Last year's loss
in the finals will make us that

centive.” _

Sophomore Michele Adamson
is looking forward to making her-
self a force at middle-blocker at
this year's tournament.

’’I’m excited with the chance to
avenge last year's loss and I am
anxious to play a significant role
in it,” she said.

Pitt's first game will be Saturday
at 10 a.m. against No. 8 seed
Boston College, a match which
Pitt should handily win.

In the semi-finals, if the tourna-
ment holds true to form, the Lady
Panthers should face Providence
on Saturday at 8 p.m. Pitt should

get their revenge.

led by tailback Tyrone Jackson, a
former Pitt recruit, with 397
yards. Another N.C. runner
recruited by Pitt is tailback Chris
Williams, currently third on the
team with 225 yards.

‘'1 know a little bit about those
guys,” Gottfried said. ”They give
you a couple of different looks
and could cause us some
trouble.”

Facing yet another option team
hasn't really thrilled Panther
defensive back Alonzo Hampton.

’’If everything is run right, the
option is hard to stop,” Hampton
said. ”Everybody has to play
smart and play their responsi-
bilities.”

The Pitt offense has really come

together over the last few weeks.
Freshman tailback Curvin Rich-
ards has run for 1,091 yards, with
an astounding 6.5 yards per car-
ry. Quarterback Darnell Dicker-
son has thrown for 1,329 yards
and is second on the team with
481 rushing yards.

”We can hurt a lot of people
with our offense,” Richards said.
”Everybody is playing together,
and we know each other now.
That helps a lot.”

Richards is this season's suc-
cess story. When junior Adam
Walker succumbed to numerous
injuries, Richards was able to step
in without missing a step. He is
most likely the leading contender
for freshman—of-the-year honors.

"The credit for all my accom-
plishments has to go to the offen-

sive line,” Richards said. ’’I’m just
happy that I got a chance to
play.”

The Wolfpack defense has the
ability to shut anyone down. lt is
led by two very strong safeties in
freshman Jesse Campbell (79
tackles) and senior All—American
candidate Michael Brooks (78
tackles). They play in a 5-0
defense, so the safeties play like
linebackers.

”They kick it down a little bit

strong and weak; they are pretty .

good on defense,” Gottfried said.
”We aren’t going to change our
offense for them. We added a
couple of new things for Penn
State last week, and I'm sure we'll
add a few wrinkles again this
week. Basically it will come

Denise Frawley and a strong Pitt team host the Big East Tournament Championships Saturday.

solid competition for Pitt

The tournament finals take
place at 2 p.m. on Sunday after-
noon. If the top two teams face
off, it will be Pitt and Syracuse.
Despite losing to Pitt 3-0 at the
Penn State Volleyball Classic two
weeks ago, it was a hard fought
match.

”Although we beat Syracuse
3-0, our team realizes we must
play well to win. I think our team
is looking forward to playing
Syracuse in the finals, but they
realize they must play one match

at a time,” said Pitt coach Shel-‘

ton Collier.

An integral performer for the
Lady Panthers will be All-
American candidate Denise
Frawley. Not only is she the con-
ference’s best player but as a
senior she has an added in-
centive.

”|’ve won the Big East title
once and lost it twice. More than
anything, I'd like to go out a win-
ner. it is exciting being the host
team and we are really ready to
win,” noted Frawley.

The Lady Panthers will look to
Julie Sheils for power hitting from
the outside hitter position as well
as providing a strong serve. It will
be Sheils inaugural appearance in
the Big East tourney.

’’I’m excited, especially in
knowing that we have an ex-
tremely good chance of winning
the Big East,” commented Sheils.

Co-captain Kelly Matheis (with
Frawley) will be relied on by her
teammates to pick up the offen-
sive slack when Frawley rests her
arthritic feet.

"l think our team is doing real-
ly well, and we will be real moti-

vated for the Big East,” said
Matheis.

Middle—blocker Nora Mulvihill
expected to be a defensive force
at the net is enthused about her
Big East swan song.

’’I’m psyched. When we host-
ed the Big East tournament when
l was a sophomore, we had all
our family and friends there.
Now, it's my senior year and
we're at home, again.

The fuse that lights the explo-
sive Pitt pyrotechnic attack is set-
ter Jenelle Lantagne who is the
Big East's best setter.

”Our offense is running very ef-
ficiently. l have a lot of confi-
dence in all our hitters, and they
are among the most important
reasons for our success,” noted
Lantagne.

Meloche says Penguins could
become biggest dra win town

football rivalries

This is the week of traditional

g rivalries in college football. South

Carolina travels to Clemson to
take on the Tigers in a battle for
state supremacy. Michigan visits
Ohio State for a game that many
consider college football's No. 1
rivalry. Nebraska travels to Nor-
man to play the Sooners in the
annual showdown for the Orange
Bowl. California hosts Stanford in
The Game. And Washington
State is in the unfamiliar role of

favorite over Washington in what
has been called the best rivalry
that nobody knows about.

But perhaps the biggest game
of all is USC versus UCLA. This
could have been the battle for
No. 1 if the Bruins hadn't been
upset by Washington State. But
it's still the battle for the Rose
Bowl.

Last week: 4-6 (.400); for the
year: 69-34 (.670).

First Upset of the Week:

UCLA —-— 27, USC — 17

It's too bad. No. 1 Notre Dame
versus No. 2 USC would have
been a classic. Once again, the
Rose Bowl will have no bearing
on who will be the national
champion.

Okla. — 20, Nebraska — 16

The Sooners may get a shot at
their nemesis, Miami, in the
Orange Bowl. .

Pitt — 21, NC State —- 7

Pitt pushes its record to 7-3
against a very tough Wolfpack
defense.

WVU —— 31, Syracuse — 10

It's very chic to pick the
Orangemen in an upset over the
Mountaineers. WVU will roll.

Army — 23, BC — 17

Army is on the brink of crack-
ing the Associated Press Top 20.

Notre Dame — 24, PSU — 22

Despite reports to the contrary,
there is plenty of stress these days
in State College.

Mich. — 28, Ohio State — 21

Beating Rose-Bowl—bound
Michigan would almost salvage
the season for the Buckeyes.
Though the game is being played
in Columbus, it won't happen.

,. Wash. St. — 27, Wash. — 19

Could the balance of power be
shifting from Seattle to Pullman?
Nah. ‘

Second Upset of the Week:

LSU — 20, Miami — 17

Many people breathed a sigh of

down to the things we do best,
and if we can do them, we'll be
successful. If not — if they shut
us down — we'll have to go with
something else. We are just go-
ing to do the things that got us
here.”

This is the seventh time in his-
tory that the Panthers have played
the Wolfpack. Pitt leads the ser-
ies, 4-1-1, including last season's
34-0 victory at Pitt Stadium.

In light of what happened to
the Panthers this past week, this
game takes on an extra dimen-
sion. Anything can happen.

relief when Notre Dame upset
Miami, thinking that finally Mia-

‘mi would not be playing for the

national title. But it will take this
upset win by LSU to put the Hur-
ricanes away for good.

Stanford — 31, Calif. — 28

USC versus UCLA is actually
not the Pac-10's biggest rivalry, in
terms of ill feelings. Stanford-Cal
IS.

Clemson — 29, South Caroli-

na — 20

A disappointing year for both
teams, although Clemson gets to
play in a minor-major (or major-
minor) bowl — the Citrus.

By Matt Martin
Sports Editor

The Pittsburgh Penguins
have become one of the hot-
test sports attractions in town
over recent years. With the
play of 1987-88 National
Hockey League MVP Mario
Lemieux, All-Star defenseman
Paul Coffey and a cast of up-
and-comers, the Penguins fu-
ture looks bright.

And in the eyes of one man,
even brighter than anyone
may expect.

”Hockey is fun in this town
once again. This town could
be better — just as good, if not
better than, Philadelphia,”
said Gilles Meloche, the
38-year-old Penguins

goaltender who retired after
last season.

’’All you have to do is start
winning some games, which
they are starting to do. People
are starving for a winner, espe-
cially now with the way the
Steelers are going.

”There’s no doubt that over
the next two to five years, the
Penguins are going to be the
No. 1 team in town,” Meloche
said. ”They’re just one or two
players away.”

Meloche, a 17-year veteran
of the NHL, finished out his
last three seasons (1985-88)
with the Pens, but has not
dropped out of sight.

Meloche now works for
long-time friend Chris Monti at
Touch of Gold Jewelers on

Meyran Street in Oakland,
where he hopes to become
part-owner sometime’ next
yean

A Pittsburgh coaching job
that seemingly belonged to
him earlier in the year disap-
peared when Hall-of-Fame
goaltender Tony Esposito was
hired as vice president and
general manager of the Pitts-
burgh club in April.

”Eddie Johnston was in
charge, and he told me I was
the goalie coach in the organi-
zation. Then Tony Esposito
came in, and he was another
goaltender, and he said he
could handle the job himself,"
Meloche said.

But Meloche, who played

for four teams in his career,

still keeps close ties with hi
former teammates. ‘

’’I haven't missed a home
game so far,” Meloche said
last week. ’’I talk to them after
the games. I keep in touch
with all the players. Some-
times in practice they come
and just get some stuff off their
minds.”

One thing Pittsburghers
can't get off their minds is the
potential of this team, particu-
larly with Lemieux in the
Hneup. '

”This team is just an average
team without him right now.
The kids haven’t developed
enough to carry the team on
their own. With Mario in there
they're an above .500 team.
Without him, they're just a
.500 team.”

The Penguins have had no

trouble scoring goals this year,
but have also had no luck
stopping opponents from
scoring.

”l don't think they've played
bad. Defensively, they haven't
played well as a team, and
their special unit kills them.
They're giving up two or three
power-play goals a night, and
that's teamwork,” said
Meloche, who had a 8-9-5
record and 4.09 goals against
average in ’87—88.

Meloche should know the
ups and downs of a pro fran-
chise. He was drafted out of
the junior ranks in Montreal
and went straight into the
California Golden Seals or-
ganization.

After five years there, the
franchise moved to Cleveland
(Bears), which eventually
merged with the Minnesota
North Stars franchise.

It was in Minnesota that

Meloche enjoyed the most
profitable period of his career.

”We had some good teams
for a couple years. We played
in the Stanley Cup Finals one
year, and we were in the semi-
finals a couple other years.
That's what you play the
whole season for, so those
were great times.”

But Pittsburgh compared
favorably with his days in Min-
nesota, Meloche said.

’’I was lucky enough to play
with Mario for a few years. In
my book, he's the greatest
player in the league right now.
He’s above Gretzky."

Unfortunately for Meloche,
the Penguins seem to have be-
gun their upswing immediate-
ly after his departure.

”They can't go back now.
They've too many good young
kids and the best hockey play-
er in the world. They can't go
wrong.”

Seton Hall is an extremely

"young team, known by their

hometown fans as the ”Kiddie
Korps.” The Lady Pirates have
started four, five and even six
freshmen at a time during the sea-
son. Senior captain Rachael
Meeker has been able to lead this
exuberant squad to their best
record in five years.

Defending Big East champion

Providence struggled through a ,

rebuilding season; however, if
they play the Lady Panthers, look
for the sparks to fly. Last season,
the Lady Panthers were the tour-
nament’s No. 1 seed before be-
ing upset by the Lady Friars in the
finals.

Villanova comes into the tour-
nament with a 13-22 record. The
Lady Wildcats will be led by co-
captains Karen Fraser and Debbie
Opitz.

This season was a rebuilding
year for Boston College. They
suffered through four defeats in as
many games against Big East op-
ponents en route to a 5-16
record.

House
approves -
anti-agent
bill

HARRISBURG (AP) —+ A
senate committee,Tuesday ap-
proved legislation designed to
protect student athletes from
unscrupulous agents. The
measure, supporters said,

would clamp down on agents “

who operate virtually unfet-
tered by rules or regulations,
and sometimes lure students
into contracts with money or
other promises. The bill,
which was approved by the
House in June, would ban
agents from entering into con-
tracts with students until their
eligibility for collegiate athlet-
. ics expires. The measure also
would prohibit agents from
promising or giving anything
of value to a student athlete or
the student's family until after
the eligibility ends.

Several other players could be

eagerly to the tournament as his
team is.

NEW YORK —- Jose Canseco,
the first major leaguer to hit 40
homers and steal 40 bases in one
season, was selected unanimous-
ly as the American League Most
Valuable Player on Wednesday.

The muscular Oakland right
fielder received 28 first—place
votes and 392 points from a
panel of 28 sportswriters, two
from each AL city.

Canseco is the seventh AL play-
er to be the MVP unanimously,
and the first in 15 years. Hank
Greenberg (1935), _Al Rosen
(1953), Mickey Mantle (1956),
Frank Robinson (1966), Denny
McLain (1968) and Reggie Jack-
son (1973) were the other unani-
mous selections.

Boston left fielder Mike Green-
well, with 242 points, was
runner-up to Canseco. 1
