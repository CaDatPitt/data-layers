Clipper include dancing, folk

other activities students are. in-
clined to engage in on a moonlight

Board member said. Cross also
urged any students with banjos,
or guitars to bring their instru-
ments along.

Tickets for the trip will cost 75
cents per person or $1.25 per
couple. Transportation to Point
State Park will be provided free
of charge.

Buses will leave the front en-
trance of the Student Union at
8:30 p.m., reaching Point State
Park at 9 p.m. and returning to
the; union shortly after 11 p.m.

 

vP1anners of the Jazz Club be-
lieve that they can set up a na-
tional organization, enabling uni-
versities to bring to their campus-
es the country’s best jazz perform-
ers. Gary Levinson, organizer of
the club, says, “The fall promises
unlimited possibilities in the realm
of jazz.”

A jazz club could provide con—
certs in conjunction with Football
weekends and other activities. It
could plan tri—college concerts
with Carnegie Tech and Duquesne.

The Jazz Club will co—operate-

with the clubs at Penn State and
the University of Pennsylvania,
and Jazz Horizons Unlimited, a
group which has sponsored many
Pittsburgh jazz programs.

  

Reynard will do two canvas
painting demonstrations, one tra-
ditional, the other abstract. Both
paintings will be of the same sub-
ject, and in this manner he hopes
to give a clear idea of the varia-
tions of the two forms.

He will also be available at the
customary coffee hour from 3 to 5
p.m. to answer questions on the
subject of art.

The son of musically inclined
pa-rents, Reynard studied piano
and composition ir his early
years. but gradually his love for
art transformed him into a
painter. He attended the Art

Letters to the Editor

Professor Lashes

Trustless University

Editor, The Pitt News

This is a note in support of
Ina Amdur’s characterization of
the administration of this uni-
versity asliars. I am prompted
to write this because I am angry
over the latest incident of flag-
rant‘ lying and academic irre-
sponsibility which has hurt me

“personally.

The incident — if I can get my
tendcncy to homicidal incoher-
ence under control —— can be
briefly told. Some months ago
the departmental administration
asked me to teach two courses
this summer, one of them a grad-
uate “service” course in histori-

ical method. Subsequently, I was

offered a job teaching summer
school elsewhere for a $1000
more salary and in range of li-
braries ‘I needed.

I turned the offer down be-
cause I knew Pitt couldn’t re-
place me on such short notice.
But I did immediately and fully

explain to the administration‘
that I was in particular ﬁnancial

distress over the summer and

' that I had to be able to count on

my summer salary. (Pitt is the
only school I have heard of
where this would be necessary-
where they not only don’t teach
most of the attractive courses in
the catalogue, but where they
cancel courses in the catalogue
on the basis of enrollment ﬁg-
ures, lumping survey offerings
with graduate seminars!)
Without even telling me, Char-

ales Peake, Vice-Chancellor of the
I Academic Disciplines (or some

such) cancelled my course, and
half my salary, before it met.
My chairman, who is a pro and a
nice person, went to bat for me
but he was left swinging at air

(my metaphors must be excused
-—I have had better days at the
typewriter, and the Pirates
bother me almost as much as
these thick-headed administra-
tors.)

Of course Peake wouldn’t

argue the case on the basis of
academic propriety, justice to an
employee, or common decency.
Just, no. The result is that in
order to support my family this
summer I must rush to its con-
clusion a book I am writing for
a commercial publisher. Press-
ing in writing, as in baseball, is
bad practice; I know it but I am
forced to it. There is a sentence
in a ﬁne essay by Bertrand Rus-
sell on “The Functions of a
Teacher” which concludes that
“the immense majority of educa-
tional institutions are hampered
and controlled by men who do
not understand the work with
which they are interfering.”
_ Vice-Chancellor Peake is will-
fully interfering with my Work,
and with that of my students and
the department. His motivation
is presumably to save money for
better purposes than paying my
salary. Shouldn’t we in the" de-
partment at least be told what
they are?

Am I wrong to expose my
frustrated anger? Perhaps so; it
is embarrassing to complain in
public —— the administrators
count on the ﬁne discretion of
our effete profession. But I want
to remind my employers that
students and teachers are the
University, and it may be that
the way to encourage students
to help break the hideous im-
personality of this institution is
to let them see that in fact their
university is run like a marginal
corporation with a company
union — and not like an asso-
ciation of scholars and students.

The Battle of Ideas...

A Manufactured Chaos

By Harriet Welmer

One of the basic laws of physics states that for
every force there is a counter-force. This same
principle can be applied to a university, since
within any educational institution a basic polariza-
tion of ideas can and should exist; by having these
differences and by making concessions, one avoids
crystalization of one group’s di-
rection.

The quickest way to create a
bridgeless gap between the vari-
ous members of a university is
for one segment of that organiza-
tion ‘to become so forceful that
other ideas cannot survive with-
in the same structure.

At the present time, a wide
gulf between the top administra-
tors and everybody else exists;
it has not been created by the
trimester or one man and I am not being facetious.

The trimester has been the favorite scapegoat
for all internal discontent. And yet the trimester
per se means only a more rigorous and concen-
trated educational process -- a necessity -—- if the
University is going to emerge from the primitive
position that most American universities occupy.

Theory of Time

The whole conﬂict seems to center around the
basic belief held by some people that “time is
running out.” I’m not sure how this idea became
so ﬁrmly embedded in our minds, maybe, it’s ‘a
world-wide phobia that appears every other century.

But by rushing we end up with two new sets
of code numbers appearing within two months for
courses. ‘This merely makes time-consuming
work for the people in the Office of Student Records.

We ﬁnd the admissions office in a state of
chaos because the catalogues are not completed
on the designated date for sending brochures
to prospective freshmen. Meanwhile faculty
members are astounded because they must decide
in a few weeks what books they will use in their
courses for the next two years in order that it
can be printed in the booklet. They don’t even have
time to carefully select texts from recently pub-
lished books, let alone read them.

Nuclear or Conventional War?...

 

These are just minor changes; the confusion
accompanying major changes could not _be con-
sidered here. The point is that no one has time for
anything. We don’t listen to the proposals made
by administrators in the student affairs area be-
cause they think expensively too. Yet these ad-
ministrators consider their ideas and plans just as
important and necessary as establishing graduate
schools, building dormitories and cutting corners
for economical reasons.

Student affairs’ administrators want to play a
role in this “calculated effort to advance Pitt to
the forefront of American education” too. But time
is running out, I’m told -— well, I’m afraid some
of the administrators are too.

A Small Nucleus .

The main result of this thrifty campaign be-
sides confusion is a. small nucleus of men who tend
to agree on what has to be done and how it will
be done. It is this group that is making the “yes
man” and “the good administrator who can ad.
minister any policy” a reality in the city of Pitts-

burgh — a group that unconsciously showers fear
and force on everyone under them without even
trying. ’

After ﬁve years the Chancellor finds himself
surrounded by a group of _ men with very little
polarization of ideas. Who can be blamed for this
solidiﬁcation? I’m not sure — possibly the counter-
force of ideas is not strong enough.

. But if this belief of time running out continues,
there will be an excess of “the typical crackpots”
sounding off at Tap Day banquets or at faculty
meetings, in the Pitt News or in soundproof rooms;
there will be more resignations for the same rea-
son that people are resigning now.

We have to take time to do things; we have to
at least try to make every member of the Uni-
versity_an integral part of our changes, even if it
means stunting our growth a little while we listen
to their ideas.

More than anything else, I liked to see stu-
dents shake-off this neurosis about wasting time
on activities or diversions such as the Midday
series, concerts or even hours at Gustines. To me
leisure moments and discussions of ideas, policies
and programs are not a waste — they’re concerned
with a changing universe and equally educational.

The Berlin Crisis

By Nathan Firestone

On a certain day in the near future, sooner than
we may care to think, a ﬁnal crisis will probably
be faced over Berlin. Aside from negotiations grant-
ing satisfaction to both sides, an unlikely possibility,
Khrushchev may back down; the West may back
down, or the world may be plunged into the great-
est, and probably the last, of the
great conflicts _between nations. 

The last possibility is one that
is really too terrible to compre- 
hend, for no side could get any
satisfaction out of victory in such
a conﬂict, if a thing such as vic-
tory is ‘really possible. But then,
there should really be no reason
to be unduly optimistic, for the
outcome of past discussions be-
tween heads - of - state should
serve to demonstrate that if any
area of conﬂict in the cold war has two almost
irreconcilable viewpoints, then Berlin is that area.

Our actions during the last 16 years have clearly
shown that Berlin must be regarded as the Fort
Sumpter of Europe, an area from which we can-
not be cut off. And communist statements should
leave no doubt that they are serious over Berlin.

Both Sides Hesitate

Not many people believe that Khrushchev wants
a nuclear war over Berlin; just as many people be-
lieve that we do not care to go to nuclear war to stop
the communists there. The only really justiﬁable
reason for resorting to nuclear weapons would be to
retaliate against a nuclear attack. But politicial
leaders are people, too; and sometimes fear of a
major setback can prod irrational actions. And it is
not really too inconceivable to imagine Messrs.
Kennedy and Khrushchev ﬁnding themselves in a
position from which neither could gracefully back
down.

United States policy makers know this now. But
they also knew it, or should have known it, eight
years ago. And they should never have permitted
an almost, complete conversion from a conventional

 

to a nuclear retaliatory force in Europe. It is one
thing to go to the “brink” of a conventional limited
war. But it is entirely another situation to keep go-
ing to the “brink” of nuclear catastrophe. But then
the sacriﬁces of keeping a strong enough conven-
tional army in Europe (to thwart communist
moves) may have been more than the Eisenhower
administration thought the American public was
willing to bear. For the personal burden of keep-
ing a large standing army is in many ways more
difficult than the burden of diverting a large share
of defense funds (which is a large share of the
budget) to building bigger and better hydrogen
bombs, and to building missiles that can deliver
them in ﬁfteen minutes rather than half an hour.

Of Equal Effectiveness

Retaliation against an attack on Berlin by con-
ventional forces would be just as effective as
nuclear retaliation, provided that these forces are.
strong enough to resist.

Of course in the short run, it is inﬁnitestimally
easier to let the responsibility for carrying on a W31‘
rest in the hands of a few button pushers than it is
to maintain a large enough standing army to resist
such aggression and to act as a non-nuclear deter-
rent.

It is certainly our duty to be prepared for
nuclear aggression. But it is also our duty to be
Prepared for a conventional type of aggression, and
we are not. We have enough bombs and missiles to
destroy Russia in case of nuclear attack. There is
really I10 point in spending vast sums of money 0“
faster and more reliable missiles. SAC may take
longer, but it can get the job done.

In his inaugural address, the President called
for Americans to make sacriﬁces. One of the most
needed sacriﬁces is a large, conventional army. and
the President must take steps to see that it be‘
comes a reality in the very near future.

If we do not, we are guilty of negligence not
only to our nation and to the western alliance, but
to humanity as a whole. Our rights in Berlin must
be defended, but the defense of these rights must
be sensible, with the long range view of protectirlg.
the American people from nuclear holocaust. ,

softball play
will come down to a critical

v‘ point this week for three
teams. IM Director Leo Bemis
has set up a double elimina-

‘given places according to their
ﬁnish in the ﬁrst half standings.
By Friday, however, only three of
six teams will remain in the battle
for the IM Championship.

The Chemical Engineers still are

listed as solid favorites to cop the
crown. The Chem—E’s ﬁnished ﬁrst
in regular season play. Schenley
Six and Psychology tied for sec-

L 0nd.

* Therr were only two tourna-
ment games played last week and
Schenley Six had a part in both
of them.

Psychology is scheduled to
meet Lambda Chi Tuesday. The
winner of that game will meet
the Chemical Engineers and the
loser will face Schenley Six,

‘ both games played Thursday.
Schenley Six after getting off to
a slow start against the Mechanic-
al Engineers won 12-9.

1 ' The Mechanicals picked up
eight runs in the ﬁrst two innings
‘off Jack Smith, but Schenley and
Smith came back strong with a
six run second inning to contain
the Mechanicals.

Schenley got their power from
the top of the lineup. Pete
Jacobs went 3-3, ,Bob Roeder,
3-4 and both Bob Gutshall and
Ben Jinks both 2-4.

The chemical Engineers damp-
e n e d Schenley’s championship
hopes Friday when ‘they edged
them 6-3. Jeff Laskoff hurled for
’§chenley and only gave up 10
hits. Five, however, came in a
four run third inning that put the
Engineers ahead to stay.

KONGPHALY SOUTHIPHONG, a hot-handed badminton player

from Laos, has completely dominated Intramural play this year.

Laotian Outclasses Opponents

By JACK

SMITH

While most Americans are born with rattles in their
hands, Kongphaly Southiphong, an exchange student from

Laos had a badminton in his,
of his game.

and it shows in the quality

Most people can’t pronounce his name so he is called

Lee. Lee came to Pitt in April

of 1961 and in his spare time

has been maintaining the bad-6
minton skill he learned in his
country, Laos. \

For the ﬁrst time this year he
entered in the Intramural bad-
minton competition and has so
dominated play that he has been
made a solid favorite to cop all
honors.

Whereas most contestants
have picked up the racquet
game in physical education
classes, Lee has been swinging
a racquet for seven years. No
honor he could win here could
match the one he received in

the skills that Lee has acquired.

Lee has two brothers and two
sisters, all younger. His father is
a treasurer with Sisavangvong
University.

Lee spent two years studying
in Thailand. At Pitt he is study-
ing to be a math teacher in his
country and has been studying
that subject along with psychol-
ogy.

“Math is all right,” Lee said,
“but Psychology is too much . . .”

The day of reckoning may
soon come upon the faculty
and administration, for they
are set to clash with the stu-
dents in a softball game Wed-
nesday at 3 p.m. at Forbes
Field. .

The game, sponsored by the
Men’s Residence Hall Council,
promises to be one of the most
hotly contested battles of the sea-
son.

Among the players to perform
for the faculty are Donald Van
Houten, Bernie Adams, Jerry
Whalen and Ron Pease. Peaselhas
been tabbed to hurl for the fa-

The student team will be made
up primarily of players from the
Schenley Six, an intramural team.

Jack Smith, who is 4-1 on the
season, will pitch for the students.
Others set to play for the students
are Bob Gutshall and Ben Jinks.

U.N. Reporters Visit Campus

12 Journalists
Meet to Study

‘A °   L°f 9
HTQTLCCUL l 8
By Jim Hufnagel

Correspondents from 12 na-
tions are visiting the Univer-

sity this week as participants
in a seminar on American life.

The week—1ong conference,
sponsored jointly by the Gov-
ernmental. Affairs Institute, the
Office of Cultural and Educational
Exchange, and the Pittsburgh
Council for International Visitors,
began last Wednesday and led the
correspondents through a full pro-
gram of lectures, discussions,
visits with Pittsburgh families,
and tours of local industry.

At a press conference last Wed-
nesday, members of the confer-
ence met with representatives of
the major Pittsburgh newspapers

. and television stations for a dis-
cussion of current issues.

The discussion was sparked
off by a query from Kenneth
Eskey, a Pittsburgh Press staff
writer, who asked George Celiz,
the Argentinian corespondent,

* why North-Latin American, re-
lations seemed to be suﬁering
in recent years.

Celiz replied, “This is an odd
problem because for a long time
the United States was an investor
in Latin America and that’s all.
Now things have changed but the
mentality of the people has not.
It is merely a matter of time.”

Eskey then asked Heinz Ohne-

HEINZ OHNESORGE, New York correspondent for a Hamburg
news service, speaks with Owl Editor Hank Bonstedt and Arlene
Russell at an informal coffee hour where campus student leaders
met the reporters from foreign countries who are visiting the

sorge, the German press repre-
sentative, whether he felt Ger-
man reuniﬁcation was possible.

“It is not a myth that the Ger-
man nation can be reunited;
sometime in the future the Ger-
mans will determine by a free
election their fate,” Ohnesorge
said. “If Germany would agree
to permanent neutralization, the
reuniting could take place but
this would mean the retreat of
Western forces and the end of
the Russian hope for a situation
like Poland.”

(Continued from Page 1)
at Presbyterian-University Hos-
pital, Eye and Ear Hospital and
Magee-Women’s Hospital.

Bed complement in the Health
Center will be increased with
a more desirable balance of
specialty and general patient
beds.

The building program will per-
mit a modest increase in enroll-
ment in the School of Medicine.

All nurseries at Magee-Women’s
Hospital will be modernized and a
new 50-incubator premature nurs-
ery and a 10-bassinet isolation
nursery will be added.

Modern facilities such as the 6-
million volt linear accelerator for

cancer treatment will be provid-
ed. '

Research will be supported in
audiology-otology, gynecology,
obstreptics, female endocrino-
logy and reonatal care, drug
evaluation and therapy, meta-
bolism and clinical medicine,
and rheumatology and ortho-
pedics.

Finally, the inclusion of Falk
Clinic in the front wing at Pres-
byterian-University Hospital will
integrate inpatient and outpatient
services, provide a comprehensive
ambulatory program for all types
of patients, unity auxiliary serv-
ices, and make possible effective
undergraduate an d postgraduate
training.

tions staff, directed a question
to,Levon Keshishian, the United
Arab Republic correspondent,
concerning Russia’s r e c e n t
proposal for three UN Secretary
Generals instead of one.

Keshishian said that “the ma-
jority of the Asian - Africans

would rather champion a plan for.

three undersecretaries Lecause
Asia feels that it is not represent-
ed fairly enough in the Secre-
tariat. There are not enough
Asians in key positions.”

Eskey addresed both Keshish-
ian and Evelyn Irons, a British
correspondent, asking for opin-
ions on Britain’s recent action in
Kuwait.

“The problem is'cnly going to
be solved by the Arab nations,”
Keshishian said, and Miss Irons
aiﬁirmed his opinion with “We
shouldn’t go poking our noses in
other people’s business.”

success are poor.”.

The college board ranking of
those students accepted is run-
ning about six per cent above last

per cent are in the upper ﬁfth of
their class, a percentage similar
to last year's. -

Many other colleges in the na-
tion are 10 per cent below last
year in the recruiting of incoming
freshmen, according to Pinneo.

The financial aspect has been a
problem to out of state potential
applicants, who could not attend
without some sort of financial as-
sistance. There has been a notice-
able lack of applications from girls
of middle class origin.

In addition the number of Pitts-
burgh and in-state applicants has
declined. The University still re-
mains a drawing card for students
from the eastern part of the
country, whereas the mid-west
sends few students, according to
Pinneo.

Reynard has had twelve one-

In expressing his views on ex-

teachers that we know the best
Way to make art.”
