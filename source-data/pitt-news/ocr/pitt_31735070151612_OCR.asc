Washington —— Students who earn associ-
ate’s degrees and occupational certiﬁcates

‘often earn more in their ﬁrst year out of

college than those with four-year college
degrees, according to a new study exam-
ining the average salaries of graduates in
ﬁve states. '

For the study, College Measures, a part-
nership between the American Institutes
for Research and Matrix Knowledge Group,
worked with Arkansas, Colorado, Tennes-
see, Texas and Virginia to obtain data on
how much graduates from two—_ and four-
year colleges in those states earned in their
ﬁrst year after graduation. College Measures
aims to improve the decision-making pro-
cess for students, parents and policymakers
for a more elﬁcient and productive higher-
education system.

“The ﬁndings challenge some conven-
tional wisdom, showing for example that
what you study matters more than where
you study,” Mark Schneider, president of
College Measures, said. “Higher education

is one of the most important investments‘

people make. The right choices can lead to

good careers and good wages,
while the wrong ones can leave

E graduates with mountains of

debt and poor prospects for
ever paying off student loans.”
Schneider said states tend
to put a lot of. money into the
ﬂagship universities, the best-
known research institutions in
each state. But his study indi-

‘ cates state legislators should fo-

cus more attention and funding
on community colleges, which
“can represent a good way for
residents of a state to get the
training that they need to get
into the local labor market and
earn a reasonable wage.”

Schneider said that regional
four-year public colleges should
also take a cue from commu-
nity colleges and think more
about how they can best train
students to ﬁll the needs of local_

job markets.

Among the lessons of the
study:

Short—term credentials, such
as two—year degrees and tech-
nical certiﬁcates, can be worth
more than bachelor’s degrees
in early years. The study found
that in Texas, those who gradu-
ated with technical assdciate’s
degrees earned over $11,000
more on average in their ﬁrst
year after graduation than those
with four-year degrees.

Those who graduate from’

ﬂagship campuses who entered
the job: market directly after
graduation did not earn more
than graduates of regional col-
lege campuses. '
In all ﬁve states, those who

A graduated with engineering de-

grees earned the most.
Graduates with degreesin

V technology, engineering and

math earned more than other

majors, but the study found no i

evidence that those with science
degrees in subjects such as biol-
ogy or chemistry earned higher
wages.

Each of the states in the
study matched studentrecords
with data collected from the
state’s unemployment insurance
database. Every state used data
from its public universities. Ar-
kansas, Colorado and Virginia
also reported data from some
private, not-for-proﬁt institu-
tions. The study did not include
earnings of students who moved
out of state after graduation.

About 20 states nationwide ,

have the kind of data used in the
study, Schneider said, but most
do not make the information
easily accessible to the public.
“What we’ve done with these
ﬁve states, every state should be
doing,” Schneider said.
Funding for the study was

provided by the Lumina Foun- '

dation, which has provided ad-
ditional funding to examine the
wages of students beyond the
ﬁrst year after graduation and
who move out of state. I

The proclamation also claims that
UPMC has kept subscribers to High-

plan from visiting UPMC facilities.

Tension between UPMC and the
city is nothing new.

The city and the ofﬁce of Mayor -

Luke Ravenstahl challenged UPMC’s
status as a nonproﬁt organization
last March by ﬁlinga civil complaint

’ in the Allegheny County Court of

Common Pleas. The city’s complaint
claimed that UPMC engaged in busi-

ness practices inconsistent with its .

legal nonproﬁt status.

UPMC responded by ﬁling a A

countersuit against the city and Ra-
venstahl, and the suit was moved to
federal court. Injune, UPMC added
Fair Share Pittsburgh, a group aﬂili-

ated with SEIU Healthcare Pennsyl-

vania, to the suit.
In a March statement, UPMC
claimed that some Community Blue

,subscribers‘were unable to use UPMC '

facilities because of limitations built
into the plan by Highmark.

U.S." involvement in Syria: A humanitarian   issue

Natalie Russell
Columnist

The conflict in Syria is more complex,
esoteric and multifaceted than a col-
lege student on a deadline can hope
to understand. However, even with
a humble research base of newspa-
per articles and BBC documentaries,
what stands out most is the serious
lack of focus on humanitarian efforts
among the mindless violence. And
yet these are the grounds on which
President Obama is justifying an at-

‘ tack on Syria.

In the White House Rose Garden
on Aug. 31, Obama described the Au-
gust chemical weapon attacks on the
Syrian rebels as an “assault on human

dignity” and emphasized tragic civil- I

ian deaths as the primary, and urgent,

. reason for intervention.

Something just doesn’t sit quite
right here.

If the argument is that Syria’s
use of chemical weapons crosses an
ethical threshold, one has to reconcile
this belief with the fact that the U.S.
government backed a series of nerve-
gas attacks orchestrated by then-ally
Saddam Hussein a mere generation

ago. What’s more, Hussein’s attacks
measured on a scale more destructive
than anything Syria has seen, accord-
ing to recently declassiﬁed CIA ﬁles.

‘ Foreign Policy magazine cites that‘

the CIA ﬁles featured the location of
Iranian troops and logistics facilities,
which Iraqis used to carry out an at-
tack with mustard gas and sarin. The
result was that the war between the
two countries started to shift in Iraq’s
favor, which ensured the Iraqi victory
that the Reagan administration had
promised. This attackwas merely the
culmination of a series of chemical
attacks that had stretched back for
several years, which were also well
known and never disclosed by the
Reagan administration.

But despite this glaring inconsis-
tency in policy, humanitarianism is
the U.S.’ story, and they’re sticking
to it. The British government has also
been trying — and failing —— to sell
the story of humanitarianism to Par-
liament with hopes of gaining their
support for airstrikes against Syria.

A govemment-issued statement
released on Aug. 29 cited the primary
legal jusﬁﬁcation for military action
as an international responsibility for

“humanitarian intervention.” Inter-
estingly enough, U.S. Secretary of
State John Kerry conspicuously left
out the phrase “humanitarian inter-
vention” in his remarks to the State
Department on Aug. 30. Instead,
Kerry’s argument focused on teach-
ing the world a lesson about the use
of chemical weapons which, as stated
above, is an argument that falls ﬂat
when presented alone.

So how does one determine
whether or not intervenﬁon is in fact
humanitarian? Beyond ambiguous

philosophical debates, there’s actu— '

ally avery concrete way to make this
judgment call. The Responsibility to
Protect doctrine —— a global moral
compact universally endorsed at the
2005 World Summit and the 2006
U.N. Security Council —— states that
humanitarian intervention is justi-

'ﬁable only in extreme cases and is

determined by six major principles.
These principles are as follows: just
cause, right intention, last resort,
proportional means, reasonable
prospects and right authority.

With thousands of civilian deaths

and millions displaced, the principle of a just
cause for some form of intervention is inargu'-
able. This brings us to the question of right
intention, which stipulates that the primary
goal of intervention is to protect civilians
from their government. As Kerry‘ stated in

- his remarks, theprimary goal of intervention

would be to discourage chemical weaponuse
as a global norm. Although this intervention

might work positively toward the stated goal,
it can’t be called a humanitarian pursuit.

Next comes last resort, which is a more
arguable point that establishes a priority
for diplomatic compromises above military
intervention. The U.S. has contributed over
$1 billion in aid to the Syrian opposition, so
it could be argued that resources fora more
peaceful solution are exhausted. _

Then there’s proportional means,
which basically means that the punishment
shouldn’t outweigh the crime. It’s not always

easy to quantify the scale of destruction and '

devise a formula for balanced retaliation. In
this case, British nongovernmental organiza-
tion Article 36 has cited the use of explosives
in densely populated cities are likely to cause
widespread civilian casualties.

What about reasonable prospects? How
likely is it that U.S. intervention will bring
about a humanitarian solution? An article
published in the Journal of Peace Research
concluded that, historically speaking, inter-
vening on behalf of rebels actually increases
the number of civilian deaths.

authority, which states that the U.S. should
attain support and afﬁrmation from an au-
thority entity before following through with
the attack. Obaina’s request for the consent
of Congress is one step toward this goal, but
the Center on Law and Globalization points
out that the obvious ultimate authority in this
situation would be the UN Security Council.

That being said, we are still left with the
followingquestions: Is U.S. intervention in
Syria inevitable? Potentially. Is it humanitar-
ian? My sources say no. I

SOCCER

Men's soccer opens ACC p

Andrew Stern
Staﬂ Wrz'ter .

Pitt men’s soccer plays in its inaugural
Atlantic Coast Conference match tonight
against the North Carolina State Wolfpack
at Dail Soccer Field. As each team opens
conference play, Pitt (0—O—2) looks for
its ﬁrst win of the season, while North
Carolina State (1-O-O) will try to get an
early—season winning spell going.

Matchup history

Tonight’s match is only the third time
that the new conference rivals will face
each other and the ﬁrst time since 1956.
The all-time series is deadlocked at one
victory apiece.

The ﬁrst match, in 1955, went the way‘
of the Wolfpack, 2-1, but the rematch went
4-1 to the Panthers the next year. Nearly
60 years later, the two teams will now
meet on an annual basis. '

NC State’s season outlook

Last season, the NC State Wolfpack
had a lot of trouble in-conference. The
team won just one conference game, and
ﬁnished 0-4 at Dail Field against ACC'op—

10th in the ACC — ahead of Virginia Tech
and Pitt. The team returns Fabian Otte,
starting goaltender for the majority of last
season, and last season’s top performer,
Alex Martinez. ‘ ‘

Last season, Martinez scored the third-
most goals in the ACC with 11, posted
the second-.most points at 32 and had a
league—leading 10 assists all en route to
being named First-Team All-ACC.

In total, NC State returns eight of its
11 starters from last season. I

‘ Panthers set to play in UConn tournament this Weekend

  

Pitt Will face miliar competition this
weekend. Sheldon Satenstein | Assistant Visual
‘Editor ‘

 

Dan Sostek

Stczﬁ‘ Wrz'ter _
The University of Pittsburgh might have
left the Big East for the Atlantic Coast
Conference this summer, but the Pan-
thers women’s volleyball team is headed
to familiar territory this Friday when
they compete in the UConn Classic in

Storrs, Conn.

Pitt (2-2) is s1a_ted to play Albany,
Northeastern and Connecticut in the
tournament. While the Panthers aren’t
overlooking their first two opponents,
the familiarity between Connecticut
and Pittsburgh gives the game some
added weight —— this will be the 24th

1 » . matchup between the two teams, with

the Panthers holding a 14-9 series lead.
UConn and Pitt last faced each‘other
Oct. 21,2012, when the Huskies beat

the Panthers 3-1. However, the team
has other concerns during preparation
for the invitational.

“We try to focus on our side more
than what the other side is doing,” ju-
nior setter Lindsey Zitzke said. “We
are going to get done what we have to
get done.”

But head-coach Dan Fisher thinks
Connecticut might not even be the
biggest game of the invitational for
the Panthers, citing_Northeastern as
potentially their strongest opponent.
Still, Fisher mirrored Zitzke’s com-
ments about the Panthers focusing on
themselves.

“We need to be able to be a strong de-
fensive team. We need to make a strong
defensive statement,” Fisher said. A

Junior libero Delaney Clesen echoed

her coach, saying that lately the focus .
of practice has revolved around aggres-
sion and defensive strategy.

“We’ve been working on improving
our defensive system and blocking, as
well as being more aggressive,” Clesen
said. ' l - .

Statistically speaking, it appears the
Panthers have lacked the aggression
needed to successfully begin matches.
In its four matches this season, Pitt has
lost the first set in three of them, being
outscored by a total of 96 points to 79
in those sets.

Fisher isn’t overly concerned about‘
those numbers.

“I think it’s too small of a sample
size at this .point,” Fisher said. “We’ll

look at it again after we play a few more
matches. We do need to start out strong,
though.”

This team is looking to put on a
strong showing in this tournament, as
its next invitational includes a matchup
with a nationally ranked Purdue squad;
Clesen believes this weekend is a great
opportunity for the Panthers to gain
some momentum before heading into
the more treacherous portion of their
schedule.

September 6, 2018 I The Pitt News-l vwwx/.piitnevvs.cor7n

“Last weekend, we 'didn’t do as well
as we wanted to,” Clesen said. “With
that being said, we deﬁnitely want to
go 3-0 and win the tournament, so we
can be stronger heading into future
games and ACC play.” if

Despite the somewhat disappointing
results so far, there have been many sil-
ver linings for the Panthers throughout
the first four games of the season. None
have been brighter, however, than the
emergence of freshman outside hitter
Maria Genitsaridi. '

Genitsaridi came to Pittsburgh from
Greece, where she played onthe nation-
al volleyball team. Filling in for senior

Monica Wignot, who has been battling
injuries to start the year, Genitsaridi
leads the team in serving.

Fisher has been much more im-
pressed with her off the court.

“Her transition has been so smooth,
coming from another country, learn-
ing a new language and a new culture,”
Fisher said. “We’re fortunate to have
her on our team.”

While Genitsaridi will play an es-
sential role in the upcoming (tourna-
ment, the centerpiece of this squad is
still going to be Zitzke, who has led the
team in assists for the past two years.

place for most assists in school his-
tory this weekend, as she needs only 14
assists to reach a career total of 2230
and pass Nicole Taurence, who gradu-
ated in 2008. But the junior brushed
off the significance of her impending

-milestone.

“[Those assists] are all because of
the hitters and the passers,” Zitzke said.
“It doesn’t really have a lot do with me.”

Rather, Zitzke is focused on the

paced the Wolfpack with ﬁve saves to
earn the shutout.

Pitt’s season so far

Pitt has played to draws in both of
its ﬁrst two games this season. The ﬁrst
came last Friday evening against Oakland
University.

In that game, the Panthers received a

goal each from Chu Chu Onyeukwu and
Ryan Myers. Sunday, Pitt played to a 0-0
draw as sophomore Dan Lynd saved three

shots and earned his ﬁrst career shutout. .

Player to watch,
If the Panthers want to have success
in tonight’s contest, they must be able to

stop midﬁelder Martinez. As noted above,‘

Martinez was one of the top performers in
the ACC last season, as well as NC State’s
most effective offensive option. ’

Martinez is a great passer and ﬁnisher,
and the Panthers must key in on him the
entire game. i ‘

Tonight, _Pitt women’s soccer (3-1-1)
will host its ﬁnal non-conference matchup
of the season, when they welcome in the
Toledo Rockets (1-3) to Ambrose Urbanic
Field.

The match marks the sixth game that '

the Panthers have played in the last two

weeks, and their fourthgame in a week. '

Toledo has been off since last Sunday,
when the Rockets hosted Kentucky.

Toledo season so far

So far, Toledo has lost to Minnesota
(2-1), Belmont (3-2) and Kentucky (2-1).
The Rockets’ lone win this season came
last Friday against the Youngstown State
Penguins, 2-1. ‘

we begin ACC play.” I

Toledo has been paced by tri—captain
Rachael Macleod. The senior has scored
three times for the Rockets in their ﬁrst

. four games. Macleod is especially impor— -

tant to the team, as the Rockets lost ﬁve
starters from last season’s team.

Toledo is predicted to ﬁnish ﬁrst in"
the Western division of the Mid-Atlantic
Conference this season.

Pitt’s season so far

Pitt notched three victories over
Duquesne, Bucknell and Central Michi-
gan. In the three games, Pitt starting
goalie Nicole D’Agostino has not allowed
a goal.

In the lone loss of the season against
Ohio State, D’Agostino allowed two goals.

On Wednesday, the Panthers drew the
Robert Morris Colonials 1-1. Pitt domi-
nated the game early on, with the team
taking a 1- olead just 10 minutes into the
game. ' 1

Robert Morris scored the equalizer in
the 31st minute, and though Pitt domi-
nated much of the game, the Panthers
were unable to score again. .

“We hid a great start to the game
and put some pressure on them early,”
head coach Greg Miller said. “We hit the
crossbar, then were ableto get a goal off
a corner kick and had a lot of momentum.
Then, we seemed to withdraw a little bit.”

Player to watch .
Rockets tri-captain MacLeod has been
the heart and soul of the Toledosqiiad
this season. The senior has scored three
times this season and continues to race
up the Toledo record books. She is tied
for fourth in career assists (14),-sixth in
points (56) and shots (149) and seventh
in goals (21). H '
