‘-‘No more pencils, no more books, no

more . . 2 ” Well, you get the idea-—two weeks
of vacation for the holidays. That’s not bad,

of course, but neither is it as good as it ap-~

pears on the surface.

Those two weeks will be pure vacation for
only a very limited number of us. There are
back assignments to be caught up, outside
reading to do, term papers to be worked over,
perhaps an accounting set to be ﬁnished, or

— maybe a group of lab experiments to be written

up. Part of the vacation period will be used
by some to earn cash for the inevitable ex-
penses of the season.

Still, the two weeks offer a break in the
routine, a chance to have fun in many ways.
And behind it alllies something far removed
from the ordinary and the vulgar.

\Vhatever your religion, Christmas is a time
for fellowship, a time for renewing the spirit.
Let ’s make it that, too.—-Merry Christmas and
a Better and Happier New Year.

Critics Cry

Much criticism has been aimed at Student
Congress during the past month .Their meth-
ods have been termed everything from mor-
bidly drowsy to downright ineffective.

They have been called names and have been
excoriated frequently. Their meetings how-
ever, have been singularly lacking in any.in-
dication of interest by the students. Seldom
is there an audience at the meetings.

‘When a group of students wanted Henry
Wallace to speak on campus they had a group
attending large enough to be called a lobby.
Congress took rapid action on the Wallace

question. When a group of students wanted a '

change in the number of male and female rep-
resentatives in the Congress they submitted a
petition and once again rapid action was taken.

Although it does seem obvious that the
group hesitates to step out and make a de-
cision “on their own,” they have frequently
bowed to the wishes of the students. "No accu-
sation can be truthfully made that they do not
wish to be of service to their constituents.

The students put them in office and conse-
quently are responsible for their actions. Stu-
dents made Congress what it is; so, rather than
sling mud, they should make known what they
want. If, then, Student Congress is “lethargic”
or _“a tool of the faculty” some changes
should be ‘made.

.Ai1d After 4:30

The appearance of an article, “Yuletide
Hits Campus” last Tuesday caused a consider-
able stir around campus. It seems that the
News took precedent for rule and suppésed
that all classes would be dismissed after 4:30
p. m. ‘We convinced many profs that this was
the case. i .

A quick call from the Registrar’s Office
conﬁrmed our misdeed. We are sorry. Classes
will be held today after 4:30 p. m., tonight
and tomorrow.

 . Les Gallagher
Adds Poefry fo List

 Of Accomplishments '

by Bill Veenis

Today, on page one, “A Prayer” is presented.
The. article marks the ﬁrst time that this par-
ticular writer has been able to squeeze his work
into the paper without considerable thought and
discussion about whether it is -readable.

_ Less Gallagher has been a staunch member of
the Pitt News staff for more than a year. His
work, however, has centered around the ﬁ3ld of
cartooning. Stitch—1es, his own creation, is the
pride of the collegiate cartooning world. More than
once this year, his editorial cartoons have done the
biting that couldn’t be done in .“ten thousand
words.” We are happy to have him on this page.

From time to time this year, Les has come up
with some work on the literary side, that, frank-
ly, wasn’t fit for the reader. It was too good.
A newspaper has limits, both low and high, with-
in its writing must be. Most of the time, the
material we see is below standards.

This is not the case with Lester Gallagher. The

started as pure prose. Frank Davis, News Editor,
cornered our good looking cartoonist a few days
ago, and asked if he would try blank verse. The
results are evident. The versatile sophomore can
now place philosophy and literature among his list
of talents. __

"Rhumba Jubilee." Spanish

Music
Notes

Version of "Deep

In the Heart of Texas"

By .le r-dry Newberg

A New Hit

Being plugged quite often by Fred Waring as
well as Pittsburgh disc jockies is “Rhumba Jubi-
lee” by Machito and his Afro-Cubans on the In-
ternational label. The vocals are handled by love-
ly Patsy Garrett, one time Waring chirper. This
tune is another “Deep-In The Heart of Texas” but
with,,,a rhumba beat. Yes, it too is a hand clapping
record. Machito, who has been playing at New
York’s Palladium Ballroom, is known as the Spanish
Stan Kenton. On the reverse side of this record
Patsy along with Jimmy ‘Atkins, also a former
Waring Vovalist, get together on “Tom Tom Boogie”
a very lively jump tune. This song was written
by former Pittsburgher Vaughn Horton.
The Story of Ballerina '

About a. year ago composers Bob Russell (Bra-
zil) and Carl Sigman (Walter Winchell Rhum-
ba, Civilization) were working on a. new tune.
Carl doodeled on the piano while waiting for
Bob to work out an idea. But instead of working,
Bob listened to his teamma.te’s doodling, ﬁnd-
ing it “six bars of exciting music.”

Two weeks later as Bob shuﬁled through some
old papers he found a phrase which, he had writ-
ten a long time ago: “A Diary Of A Ballerina.”
That’s it, he thought, and a few nights later he
and Carl sat in the Metropolitan and watched Alicia
Markova dance—they were getting background for
their tune. Markova seemed sad and wistful to
them, and "believe it or not, although ‘the house
was packed there was actually a single empty seat
in the second row. The rest of the story you know;
BALLERINA has become the‘ nation’s number one
recdrd. ’

Did Ya Know

The long awaited King Cole Trio album will
be out in January . . . Stan Kenton is now jam-
ming the Commodore Hotel in New York . . .
The Harmonicats will be Spike J_one’s guest to-
night at 10:30 EST over WJAS.

Beryl Davis’ latest recording “The Best Things

“Pass The Peacepipe,” is headed for the best
sellers list throughout the nation. Beryl -shares the
Hit Parade, with Frankie. . _ ,
Count Bassie has recorded a new version of his
famous “Blue and Sentimental” for RCA with a
vocal refrain by Bob Baily . . . Sam Donahue
will wax his original composition, “Saxo-Boogie”
among eight new sides for Capitol . . .- Johnny
Long has come up with a new signature record
of “Jingle Bells’ that is done with an ensemble
singing chorus ala J ohnny’s famous platter of
“Shantytown" . . . Advance reports indicate that
the King Cole Trio’s “Christmas Song” record on
Capitol will again be the number one tune of the
holiday season. A
°M(.}M has just turned out a record that is a
sure smash hit. Bob Houston, who is Dick Haymes’
brother, does the chirping. The songs are “A Tune
For Huming” and “Serenade Of The Bells.” Bob
also has another hit recorded-—-“As Years Go By”

, with “Every “So Often” on the ﬁipover . . .

Letters to the Editor . . .

Editor, the Pitt News: . .
As members of the temporary steering committee of the Indepen-
d-ents, we_ object to some of the material printed about us in the ,
News last Tuesday. In some strange way, the ravings and rantings
of a few individual anti—everythings seem to have given color to
the whole organization. Fortunately, however, those people are not
forming our policy for us. ' __,..
Those of us who worked on the Constitution and aims of the
Independents had not the slight-v
est intention of fostering any anti-
fraternity or sorority feeling. Our
main purpose by far is to promote
social events for those students
who cannot be included in the
frat and sorority functions and
would welcome even frat mem-
bers to our affairs, if they desire
to come. We think that wefll be
backed up by a large majority of
the Independents in our statement
that we have no quarrel with the
fraternities.
We believed that the sugges-
tions of Ken Hall of Citcom were
sound; and contrary to the state-

and incorporated into our Consti-
tution. 4

We feel that there is room on
the campus for all of us, and we
resent what appears to be a de-
liberate attempt to start a feud‘
between the frats and independ-
ents. q

We, for two, will make tracks
out of the Independents fast if
any anti-everythings get into at
controlling spot. ?These rabble-
rousers have no place in the In-
dependents and we wish that the

been sent to each member previ-
ously stressing the importance of
the gathering.

Capozzi added that, “despite
promises made by past oﬂicers

Sole opposition to the move
came from Jim Hersche, a mem-
ber of the PVA board ‘of gov-

grounds that a new group of of-

something for the membership.

Chancellor Fitzgerald’s tempo-
rary Athletic Committee has been
meeting regularly since its forma-
tion during the recent football
season furor.

The committee’s policy of not
releasing any interim statements
has led many persons to believe
the predictions of downtown
newspapers that “there’s nothing
wrong with the Pitt football sit-
uation that one gridiron victory
couldn’t remedy.”

The purpose of the temporary
committee is, in the words of Dr.
Fitzgerald, “to reexamine the ath-
letic code to see that‘_we are not
leaning over backwards.”

The committee is composed of
the regular Faculty Athletic Com-
mittee and three students and
three alumni representatives. Both
Walt Thompson and George Lynn,
student. members, declined to
comment on the proceedings of
the meetings to date, in accord

Dr. Peterson has once again an-
nounced the beginning of the ,
Doubleday Writing Awards Con-7
test, which is open only to Pitt ,
students, as one of the best oppor-
tunities for young writers" in Pitts-
burgh.

Ken McCormick, editor of Dou-
bleday, worked out the plan of an

student at Pitt when Dr. Peterson
explained that good student writ-
ers are still far from being profes-
sionals.

Margaret Cousins ﬁction editor
of Good Housekeeping, Ken Mc-
Cormick editor of Doubleday, Bet-
ty Arnoﬁ junior editor of Double-
day, and Dr. Peterson will be
judges. Each manuscript,. whether
used or not, will be given strict
criticism from all the judges.

~ Adele Dolokhov and Morton
Fine, the winners of two years
ago, both are doing professional
work and making names for them-
selves.“ Last year’s winners were
Joy Gluck and Lois Bernstein.

There are no restrictions or
rules involved in the contest.
However, Dr. Peterson ‘advises
that anything under 3,000 words
is hardly worth submitting. The
story can be either ﬁction or non-
ﬁction.

The ﬁrst batch of manuscripts
will be sent away February ﬁrst,
and the second about the middle
of March. Anyone interested
should turn in manuscripts to Dr.
Peterson. ' '

 Education. Conference

Dr. F. W. Shockley, director of the University Extension Division
sand past president of the National University Extension Associa-
-tion, attended the recent conference on Adult Education of the re-
gional committee on college and university extension pclasseses at

“ Baltimore.

The committee, of which Dr. Shockley is a member, conducted
Va seven-point discussion of educational problems confronting the

average American coommunity,
consisting of: 1

Analysis of existing aims and
accomplishments of present in-
stitutions. .

Broadening of graduate study
opportunity. ,

Survey of extension‘ projects.

Need for increased Negro edu-
cation. ,

Necessity of urging committee
groups to assist colleges in infor-
mal projects such as forums, con-
. ferences, workshops, etc. *

I Need for specialized,

business training which is needed
in the cities.

The conference was attended by
representatives from Rider Col-
lege, Temple University, Dela-
ware University, Penn State Col-
lege, West Chester Teacher’s Col-
lege and Rutgers University.

A Grad Demand
Falling Off

Although college placement bu-
reaus , are busier than ever this
year, the demand for college grad-
uatesin business and industry has
fallen ten per cent below the last
year level, according to a survey
conducted recently at a confer-
ence» of personnel executives and
university placement directors
held at Evanston, Ill. ‘

L The survey, made among 101
representative companies, reveal-
ed. that although more companies
are now making use of college
placement services, the demand
for college graduates is ten? per
cent below last year’s, in I both
technical and business ﬁelds. ’

Several reasons were given for.

the decline.

Some campuses felt that com-
panies last year recruited a larg-
er number of graduates than they
actually needed, while working at
maximum production.

Others thought that the present

scarcity of raw materials prevent-
ed many companies from operat-
ing at full capacity.

Nurses End  
Workshops
For This Year

“Teaching the Medical-Surgical
Specialties,” a two-week Nursing
workshop concludes this year’s
Nursing “workshops. By “Medical-
Surgical specialties,’?_ is meant the

latest ﬁndings in such problems

as allergy, dermitology and orth-
opedics. 1

Nurses from nine Pennsylvania
schools of Nursing, a Lieutenant
from the Navy Nurse Corps who
teaches corpsmen, and nurses
from the Veterans Administration
hospital in Chicago, and the Wood
Hospital in Wisconsin are repre-
sented in this workshop.

Under the direction of Miss
Dorothy Rood, chairman of the
department of public health nurs-

ing, the. University’s workshop is-

enabling nurses who are no longer
students to learn of new develop-
ments in their ﬁelds and helping
them solve problems which they
meet on the job. ‘

During each workshop, a par-
ticular problem is discussed in a
group led by a department ‘chair-
man of the School of Nursing.
From time to time outside spe-
cialists join the group bringing
ﬁrst hand information. The par-
ticipants also do reference work
for the ﬁnal paper and talk with
members of the staff.

At the end of the session, the
papers are mimeographed and dis-
tributed to other members of the
group. In this way all get the
benefit of each others ideas and
facts. ‘ ‘

Adds Dr. Teagardén to Staff

The Maternal Health Center of. Pitts-burgh has added Dr. Flor-
ence Teagarden, professor in the department of psychology, to its
staff in an advisory capacity. Due to an unprecedented demand for,
and an acute shortage of adoptable children, Dr. Teagarden will
assist in conferences with childless couples desiring children to de-
termine if there are psychological barriers preventing childbirth.

Doctors have noticed for a long time that many childless couples
married for years have, upon adopting a child, soon had one of
their own.‘This has happenedtoo often to be chance, according to
Dr. Teagarden. She believes that‘v‘

Beats Lazy Six

Opening night of the IM basketball season found all eight mem-
bers of Monday’s All-Star League in action at Trees Gym. _
Of the eight quintets, three indicated they would be the powers in
the forthcoming weeks. The trio consis_ts‘of the Johnstown Associa-
tion ,Gophers,~ and Gumshoes, the latter an Ellsworth Center outﬁt.
Narrowing the situation down still further, the boys from Johns-

town look, from ﬁrst appearances, like the class of the league.

Johnsfown Assn.

In their game with the Lazy¢

Six, J ohnstown exhibited a rock-
ribbed defense. Their passing and‘
ball-handing were also surpris-
ingly effective, considering the
fact that it was the ﬁrst game of
the season.

Although not too sharp as yet
in their shots at the hoop, the As-
sociation still managed to ﬂip in
enough to top their rivals, who
tired badly in the second half, by
a count of 27-11.

With a little more polish on
shooting, the Johnstown ﬁve’ will
be hard to beat.

In another contest, the Gophers
mopped up a rather inept Band
Rambler combine, 47-13.. So one-
sided was this one that the losers
didn’t have a point until midway
in ‘the_ second quarter.

Scoring honors for the evening
went to Bob Badke, forward for
the Gumshoes. Bob dumped in ten
ﬁeld goals as his team-mates and
he out-powered the Band Lead-
ers, 46-33, in the inaugural event.

Ellsworth’s other representative
in the league, the Ellsworth Y,
brought the Center’s average
down to .500 by dropping a close
tilt to the Jive 5, 26-23.

ors to an impressive 45-22 vic-
tory over an undermanned Dental
Inﬁrmary ﬁve in the feature con-
test in Monday night’s inaugural
play in the intra-mural Cosmo-
politan ﬂoor loop.

The Dental ‘Inﬁrmary team,
playing without a substitution,
was no match for the well—condi-
tioned football players, who got
away to an early lead, stretched
their margin to 23-5 at the half,‘
and ‘coasted home.

Skladany and Short scored 30
points between them, while Dent
forward Molnick tallied 12 to pace
the losers. "Wh "‘" 1'"

Plan Released
For Firsl Home
Basketball Till

Students desiring to attend the
home basketball inaugural be-
tween the Panthers and Penn
State’s Nittany Lions, Saturday
night, January 3, will be admitted
on a ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-served basis
to the limit consistent with safe-
ty regulations.

Presentation of Student Activi-
ties Cards, along with the cus-
tomary identiﬁcation cards, at
Gate Two will supplant for this
game the exchange setup which
will be in force for succeeding
home games.

Last year, approximately 2500
were permitted to attend the
games in the Stadium Pavilion.

Gates will open at 6:15 p. m. A
preliminary attraction is schedul-
ed for 7:15 p. m., while the con-
test between the Panther and Lion
varsities will commence at 8:15
p. m.

The system which will be in
force for the ﬁve succeeding Sta-
dium attractions will be the same
as that for last year.

Two days will be named in ad-
vance of each game for procuring
tickets from an agent who will
be stationed in the University
Bookstore.

On the ﬁrst day, those who have

not attended the preceding game
will be given preference in ob-
taining tickets for the next game.
On the second, remaining tickets
will be distributed on a ﬁrst-come,
first-serve basis.
‘ Student Activities Cards and
student identiﬁcation cards are re-
quired. The Activities Card is
punched and a ticket for the spe-
ciﬁc game is given the applicant.

This plan is required because
of attendance limitations placed
on athletic events staged‘ on the
Pavilion ﬂoor.

On the Southern basketball trip,
Coach Dr. H. C. Carlson joins the
New Orleans Monday Quarter-
back Club of the Mid-Winter
Sports Association as a dinner

26 guest.

Penn State Denies
Recognition to YPCA

_ STATE COLLEGE, PA.-—The Senate Committee on Student Wel-
fare at Pennsylvania State College denied the petition of the Young
.Progressi\‘e Citizens of America for a charter as a student organi-

zation. A

The YPCA was granted the privilege, however, of holding meet-
ings in the college buildings as an informal group.
In its report, the committee stated that a study of the statement

of purposes of the YPCA indicat-
ed that although it is non—par-
tisan in the sense that it is allied
with no political pa-rty, its objec-

~ tives are political.

That is, it exists for the purpose
of organizing support for legis-
lation which it favors and for can-
didates for public office which it
favors. '

The report pointed out that al-
though it recognized the purposes
of the parent and student organ-
ization as legitimate and com-
mendable in citizenship educa-
tion, its question is only as to
whether or not a student organ-

’ ization with such purposes should

be granted recognition as a char-
tered campus organization to use
rooms in college buildings for its
meetings.

The report further stated that
in the past the college has always
as a matter of policy tried to keep
aloof from partisan politics.

Supplementing this
Arthur J. Warnock, dean of men,
stated that the same policy has
been followed heretofore in the
case of student Republican and

' Democratic political clubs.

g January 10, 1948 will be the
last day Veteran students will
be permitted to requisition
supplies on their Consumable
Supply ‘Card. These cards must
be closed by the Bookstore as
of that date.
