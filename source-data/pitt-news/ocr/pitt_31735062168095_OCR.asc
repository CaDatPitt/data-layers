(Editor's Note: This article is the
second part of a series designed to
give the background on the strike
which is scheduled for '6 a.m. to-
day.)

The position of the University on
union representation was explain-
ed in a March 12 press release
from the University.

"The University of Pittsburgh."
it read. "has been advised by le-
gal counsel that it must follow the
precedent of a recent labor arbi-

tration proceeding and acknow-V

ledge the jurisdiction of Local 29.

ion of, employees at Western
Psych. '

"The opinion from counsel was
sought by the University follow-
ing demands by Local 29 . . . that
should acknow-
ledge Local 29's jurisdiction at
the Institute. ' ‘ V

“In the arbitration proceedings
over the Nurse’s Residence, the
University had taken no position

but had agreed to abide by the ar-
bitrator’s finding. Local ll99P
had been invited to present its
case during the arbitration but
had declined when the arbitrator
stipulated that the union could
make a presentation only if it was
willing to abide by the finding.
"University officials expressed
the hope that some method of test-
ing the validity of the legal opin-

ion givenby its counsel in the case ’

of Western Psych can be found in
the courts. through the judicial
procedures of the AFL-CIO. or by
some other independent. neutral

mediating agent. Such a test. the
L'niversity indicated. would serve
to clarify the jurisdictional issues
involved . . . and would not be un-
welcome. If such a procedure re-

' versed the finding of counsel. or

made it inapplicable. some means
of determing the workers‘ desires
concerning a bargaining agent
would be sought.

"However. under the present
circumstance. the University has
no alternative but to follow the
finding of the arbitration decision
and the opinion of attorneys."

students and other sympathizers.

Discusses Theories

by NANCY RUTHER

Buried beneath room L—009.
Clapp Hall. is the tiny office. G-27.
of the Chemistry Department's
Dr. David Schumacher. In an in-
terview Tuesday. this voluble pro-
fessor revealed his theories on
subjects he is presently involved
with. ranging from teaching a
Chemistry 80 course to draft coun-
seling. ‘

Though very interested in re-
search. Dr. Schumacher thorough-
ly enjoys his Chem. 80 class. say-
ing. “I've really had fun-with it."
Realizing the general student
apathy in Distribution of Studies
courses such as this. he has pro-
vided a rather unique program to
satisfy the wide range of inter-
ests of his students.- '

, .This course consists of three

tracks: .1) independent study: 2)

problem solving and preparation _

for advanced "chemistry studies

ing assistantt: 3» a lecture and

discussiontrack conducted by Dr.

Schumacher. ._ ,
“'I‘,-hepurpose of my lecture and

discussion group." said Dr. Schu-A

macher. "is to help people appre-
ciate chemistry and what chem-
ists think)" ‘Asked why they fear-
ed science..most students. at the
beginning of the term replied that
they couldn‘_t relate it to everyday

-reality. To alleviate this. the doc-

tor says.’ "I‘ve tried to relate

chemical problem solving to other ’

fields: English, political science.“

Distribution courses by saying,
“In this class, there is no penalty
of any kind. Students have prob-
lems so why should I add to
them?”

To aid in the resolution of stu-

dents’ problems. he has explored X‘

such topics as compulsory death

and birth control. cheating. lottery A

systems in college admissions.
and the draft in his Friday dis-
cussions. Topics for lecture have

' included method of madness. sci-

ence or science fiction. and trans-
mutation of man by man.

Dr. Schumacher. who served in
the Army. is active in draft coun-
seling. He brightened perceptibly
at a question on this subject and

replied: "I've been very effective .

in keeping people out. After talk-
ing for a while. we can always
find some problem." He then quip-

ped. "I mostly show people how to‘

write effective letters."

, i -' In a more serious vein, the doc-

tor asserted, “I have moral
qualms about it because, for ev-
eryone I get out, someone else
goes in. So, I don't ask for a rea-
son. Any reason is valid.” '

'4 His work to improve the Uni- '

versity community carries furth-
er than teaching and draft counsel-
ing. Two years ago a university
committee/on the racial crisis

pledged equality of opportunity

and employment. The doctor is
still trying to insure that this
pledgeis maintained. ’ - I

The conditions of graduate. stu-
dents living in the Koch apart-
ments also occupies the profes-
sor's thoughts. He maintains,
"The terms of their contracts are

imuch harsher than commercial '

contracts.‘ or even dorm con-
tracts.“

Dr, Schumacher received his

:..a

B.A. from'Johns Hopkins Univer- ‘

sity and then earned his Masters

Sponsoring the awards. present-

the gowns‘ 40 year period of us-
age. their quality deteriorated.
creating the need for new caps and
gowns.

If brand new gowns were rent-
ed. their cost would be consider-
ably higher than the old rental fee.
A bachelor’s gown would cost $8.
a masters $10. and $12 for a doc-
tor‘s gown. Aside from the high
cost. there are also other incon-
veniences with rental gowns. The
rental period is for one day only.
The regalia has to be returned the
same day as graduation in order
to avoid additional costs. Due to
the short rental period. there are
always enormously long. slow
lines at the book store.

The advantages to be gained
from buying keepsake gowns are
many. Surprisingly enough, the
cost is the prime advantage in
buying this type of gown. The new
garments, which are of good qual-
ity, would sell for $7.25 for a bach-
elor’s, $13.75 for a master’s, and
$22 for a doctor’s.

The same day returning of
gowns and the long lines at the
book store are eliminated through
buying the academic regalia.

There are also used gowns sold

MAN - the only rational animal

crat of October, November, December, I969, a publication dealing
, with the technical aspects of modern society. In view of the recent anti-

pollution campaign, it is essential to clear up some of the common mis-

conceptions people harbor concerning the issue.-—Virginia Joyce)

FICTION: Although land agriculture cannot possibly take
care of our food needs, we still have immeasurable resources of‘
the sea which can be tapped so that we can populate the earth
until people are jammed together like rabbits in a warren.

FACT: The resources of the sea have been measured and found
wanting. Most of the sea is a biological desert. Our techniques for

mitive. With a cessation of pollution. complete interhational cooper-

double our present yield from the sea or do even better on a sustain-
ed basis.

But even such a miracle would be inadequate to meet the needs

' of the population growth. And there is no sign of such a miracle. In-

deed there is increasing pollution of the sea with massive amounts
of insecticides and other biologically active compounds.

In addition, a no-holds barred race to harvest the fish of the sea
has developed among China, Japan. Russia. the United States and
others. This race is resulting in the kind of over exploitation which
led to the decline of the whaling industry.

All the signs point to a reduction of the food yield of the sea in
the near future—not to a bonanza from the sea.

SU Molly Puts Out

by HOWARD BERGER
Contributor

Grandpa. tell us a story. then we promise to go to bed.

Well, all right. Did I ever tell you the story of Student Union Mol-
ly? Good !-Sit back and I'll relate to you her all—to-common biography.

Once upon a time back in the Student Union. a group of little
girls and little boys were gathered together like they did every day
to try to think up terrible problems based on the pettiness of their

"  lives. Their leader was Student Union Molly. If a boyfriend broke up
with her, she was pregnant, when she caught a cold. it was cancer.

WHAT ABOUT school, Grandpa‘? "

School was only a means whereby she could sit in the Student
Union. Well. back to the story. Her friends. or court. had the great-
est respect and love for Student Union Molly and-were by her side
through all of her trials; 18 supposed pregnancies. 12 supposed lung

, cancers, one supposed breast cancer. three supposed pneumonias.
one internal rot, 25 supposed "on-the-edge-of-nervous-break-
downs,” and one acute hemorrhoid attack.

Grandpa. what happened if someone didn‘t want to be her friend
anymore?

A good question. Student Union Molly was very pretty and would
recruit new court members and retain the old by putti_ng her arms
around them and saying how much she needed them. and out of ev-
eryone “he" was the best. The little boys found themselves constant-
.ly getting hurt, but like the legendary ass in the quicksand. the hard-_
? _ er they struggled, the deeper they sank. Yes. it was ‘sad.

HER GIRLFRIENDS, on the other hand. _remained by Student

g Union Molly in the hope that her beauty (or some of her boyfriends)

' would rub off on them. Well. one day Handsome Harry walked
through the Student Union. Molly then jumped up and ran over to him
and introduced herself. Soon, by using her most pleasant personalityx
she dragged Harry (or so she thought) into her court. Out of all her.

- boys, Harry was her favorite.

She was even human with him. It looked like Student Union Mol-
ly was changing; until one day when Harry proposed her her. Hook-
ed !_ She could return to herself. Harry would listen.. He would play._
Molly's court was pleased to see her return to the play world. They

knew now that marriage would not change their Molly. Soon the wed-
. ding day came. But Harry. an honest and believing type of person.

ﬁeger showed up. And Molly lived happily every after. Now. to bed.
1 s.

But Grandpa! If Harry was honest and believing. why didn‘t he
show up? . .

_ A HARRY BELIE_VE_D that all of Molly‘s problems actually exist-

ed. Thus, he was believing in that he took her seriously. and honest

in that he was truthful with himself by notshowing up.

Prez Levi Breakfasts
With Students? Garbage!

(Editor's Note: The column which
appeared in The Washington Post
earlier this month and subsequent-
ly excerpted in The Pitt News in
Wednesday's edition was first
brought to our attention by Robert
Newman, professor of speech and
vice-chairman of the Faculty of the
Arts and Sciences Council. The arti-
cle, written by columnists Evans and
Novak, provoked Dr. Newman to
write a letter to the publication. The
following is a reproduction of the
text.)

Mr. Philip Geyelin
Editorial Page Editor
The Washington Post
Dear Mr. Geyelin:

One of the more extraordinary
productions of your peripatetic
pundits Evans and Novak. who
seem to have touched down at Chi-
cago for a few hours last week.
puts the imprimatur on almost ev-
ery protocal of the elders of learn-
ing which stands between today's
irreverent youth and the ossified

institutions in which they are in-
carcerated. ‘ ,

We at Pitt. who under Edward
Litchfield and Wesley Posvar have
fought to establish one more meri-
torious urban center of learning.
frequently looked to the Universi-

_ ty of Chicago as worthy of emula-
tion. Your columnistslhave con-
vinced me. at least. to look else-
where.

‘ PONDER, FOR A moment. the
picture of Chicago Evans and No-
vak give us. "The hierarchy knows
best" is what it/amounts to with
the rhetoric stripped away.

If the students sit in to support
a deviant professor. don't listen

to their reasons. expell them. If

they request a voice in tenure de-
cisions. tell them to go to hell.

If they picket a cafeteria to pro-
test inadequate wages for the
workers. kick them out. This pic-
ture of Chicago is not one of sim-

ple paternalism. but of arrogant.»

omniscience.

I yield high respect to Hans
Morgenthau and Milton Fried-
man. Evan-Noval-i’s touchstones
of intellectual brilliance on the
Chicago faculty. May they pros-
per. increase in numbers and wis-
dom. and generate a clientele of-
similarly innovative teachers so
long as Chicago provides them the
opportunity. '

Butlhow long will Chicago pro- '

vide that opportunity? According
to Evans and Novak. indefinitely:

“The secret of Chicago seems to
lie in the fact that the faculty and
(President) Levi . . . believe ..in
themselves, unlike many educa-
tors across the country . . . the
Chicago faculty believes it.has' an
invaluable product that should not
be denatured by student whims.
. . . Unlike almost every college
we . have visited lately, nobody
here told us:, ‘You have to," listen
to the students; they have some-
thing important to say.” Such aca-
demic self-confidence may be the
starting point for the preservation
of the university.”

If one chooses his nouns conser-
vatively. this "Prof knows best"'
doctrine can be described as self-
serving and arrogant. If one takes

‘ a more candid view. such a posi-

tion' must be described as venal
and Orwellian. (Our pigs. that is.
are more equal than your pigs. » ‘
BUT THERE is a curious rhet-
orical linkage in the Evans-Novak
column which needs to be expos-
ed. When they generalize about the
tirnorous. decadent institutions
they have visited. those which are

f consigned to impotence .ai_id obli- '

ion-.;:th'eV Claim t

0 have“heard the

 
  

  
       

listen to the students; they have
something important to say.”

PART OF THIS IS sheer gar-'

bage. Of course we do not have to
listen to the students. We can turn
them off summarily. if we choose
to. and the Pittsburgh Tactical Po-
lice Force. ‘dogs. tear gas and all.
will rush to our aid like oil barons
to a hearing on the depletion al-
lowance. —

But the other half of this sen-

. tence is quite another thing. “They

have something imprtant to say,”
it reads. I

How the hell do these journalis-
tic butterflies think our genera-
tion acquired a monoploy on wis-
dom? What conceivable evidence
can they produce to support such
a ‘cavalier dismissal of the in-
sights and values of those who are
my students‘?

ROBERT P. NEWAN

I HAVE PROMOTED, for the
last eighteen months. student vot-
ing membership on Pitt's Faculty
of Arts and Sciences Council; on
the Undergraduate. Graduate, and
General Studies Councils; on the
University Senate. its Council.
and its standing committees‘; and

.on any future search committees
for Deans. Vice-Chancellors. Pro- ;

vosts, and even Chancellors.

I'have sat on «most of these
bodies. and observed student con-
tributions. And I am prepared to
claim that these student contribu-
tions have usually been as valu-

 

One bf ,America.’s,_’ 7;;

The official undergraduate

able as those of my fellow full pro:
fessors. and sometimes more val-
uable.

But this is grass roots intelli-
gence which flying-tripper col-
umnists might not gather. parti-
cularly if they gravitate to the

Levis and Hayakawas of the uni-

versity world.
LEVI IS AGHAST at the thought

of polluting tenure decisions with d

a student input? My reading of or-
ganizational theory indicates that
the best intelligence about a man
often comes from his subordi-
nates. not his superiors.

Levi breakfasts with students?
Bully for him; let us hope he pro-
vides a good menu. Chicago’s fac-
ulty is in a state of self confident
morale? May they ever be so,
but I seem to recall some similar
phrases applied prematurely to
generals. monarchs, presidents,
and Marie Antoinette.

“The cool Chicago campus is
paradise,” your columnists con-
clude. My campus is not paradise.
We have money problems, crowd-

ed classrooms. a small contingent . X‘;
of freaks and spoilers, some inef- 

fective instructors. and a lot of un-
expurgated racism.

Plus we admit we don‘t have all
the answers to the world’s ills. let
alone the very serious problems of
the Commonwealth of Pennsyl-
vania to which we owe a special
obligation.

But Evans and Novak are going
to have a new editor at the Wash-

-inton Post, Ben Bagdikian, who

has made some studies of the pre-
dictive accuracy of political col-
umnists.

I suggest that he take special

note of their paean of praise for
autocratic Chicago. and tell us,
sometime in the future, how their
prescription for running a univer-
sity stacks up in the long run
against the records of those of us
who are willing to admit that our
students, bearded and profane as
some of them are, "occasionally
perceive truths about the scholar-

. ly and political worlds whichswe of

the over forty generation, for all

our rank and tenure, have failed _

to see on our own. '

How Our Readers See It

Friday, March 30, l970—THE PITT NEWS—Page?5' r

 

Reflections Of An Over-Thirty Pitt Senior

Editor. The Pitt News:

I leave Pitt in April. so no one
will have “ole' Mary Lou to kick
around anymore!“ (Just made
that quote up and leave permis-
sion for anyone to use it.) Before
I leave. I would be remiss if I did
not write a letter to The Pitt
News. No one should attend a col-
lege for almost three years and
not have something to say.
Something. I have a few thousand
thoughts concerning Pitt but I
shall contain myself to a select
few. My experiences here have
made me mad,‘ glad, sad, and
“plaid” (the background on the
Tech Beer label and nice way to
say “driven to drink”).

First. I must describe my
"mad." I am “mad at" the QPA,
the Quality Point- Average.
A farcell We were told that the
QPA is not the most important
part of college life; grades are not
the be all and end" all. I happily
agreed with this, knowing that my
QPA would not determine my
worth as a person or as a teacher.
However, I was not told that a
certain QPA is required to enter
graduate school, to compete in
the “outside world” or to face
others who really know the so-
cial status of the QPA.

A 3.75 is not only Summa Cum
Laude, but means walking along
Forbes Ave. with head held high.
A 3.4 is just missing Magna Cum
Laude, unwarranted feelings of

" guilt and reduced to walking At-

wood St. A 3.0 is so neuter that one
feels completely dehumanized and
strolls only when cutting a class,
thereby avoiding friends who
know of the stigmatic 3.0. A 2.5
to 2.9 is complete degradation.
One strolls only at night and with
a St. Bernard who carries the "big

the going is the fun. And it's good ’
to know everything that goes with
sports car driving is there: front
wheel disc brakes, radial tires,
advanced -suspension, overhead

plaid label" to give one strength
to make it around the block.

So . . . this is the social hierachy
of the QPA . . . so what? The "so
what" is that the QPA is not the
measure of one's ability. or intel-
lect. It is a combination of things

. access to old tests. “cake”
courses. on campus vs. commuter
time and "system know how"
(this would involve pagesof ex-
planation), the difference between
the 18 credit semester student
and the 12 credit semester stu-
dent, plagerism vs. honesty and a
few hundred reasons that space
prohibits. I have no doubt that
there are quite a few "honest”
QPA’s, but until there can be a
clear delineation between the
"honest” and the "acquired/’ the
QPA remains a farce. Why not no
grades? Why not no tests? Why
not only learning?

Why glad? . . . And sad? Glad,
because I’ve been privileged to at-
tend classes, to have the chance to
learn, to. meet the many young

people to whom I trust the future. \

is. she was here when it was form-
ed." or “You should know about
the Ottoman Empire. you were
there when it began," or “You
come from the suburban shit life
that repulses me, but I like you.”

Sad . . . sad because there are
so many students who p a s s
through Pitt and never have been
touched . . . by learning, by social
problems, by humanness, by the
desire ‘to know- and understand
other humans, but have only been
touched by the desirability of the
piece of paper that tells the world
what onehas been doing and what
one is now supposedly qualified to
do. Saddened at those students
who never “stood up to be~count—

ed," but accepted every reform,‘
every change for the good, and .

continued to condemn the "long
hairs” and blacks who brought
the needed reforms to them. I am
most sad when I think of these
people as young; I would wish my
age on them so that they could not
control the future.

The "plaid” . . . I’m driven to

Glad, because they treated me, “ the "plaid” when I think of the ele-

zi?-','All-American Jerry Richey once "again proved himself to be
‘a real champion ashe streaked to the first Pitt NCAA track champ-
fl-ionship since Arnie Sowell won the “880” in 1956. '

  Richey, proclaimed an All-American from his seventeenth
place finish in the NCAA cross country finals, went. into the two-
:"mi'le championship race thirteenth out of a. field of thirteen as a re-
{suits of the preliminary time trials, According to Richey, “I went
/.into,the race with the worst time of thegthirteen and'I knew that
could really be embarrassed if i

“I knew I had.to do_ my best‘
" and when I got to the mile I

was /staying up. After the mile
and a half point I just said the
hell with it and turned it on for

~ _the lastfour laps.” ' -

Richey views the ‘sport of
running as more of an experience

in artistic expression. “I 1ook.at _

running like art_- work, and its

a form.-of expression that I feel "

I can do. best in. Thetkey to the
process is overcoming pain bar-

riers. -The more pain. barrierssi

After--Richey failed to qualify

for the 1968 Olympic team 'he‘

found himself. going backwards
instead" of forward, ‘The number
of pain barriers was increasing
instead -of. decreasing‘ and he

“-After, ’68,” he ,continues., ‘‘I

" With a successful NCAA tournament behind them the Pitt
track team is competing in the Cleveland Knights of Columbus Meet.
They’re not over-exerting themselves, though.

The onlyientrants in the meet will be the mile and. the two-mile

‘relay teams, Bryant Salter and,Bill Kalchthalter.

“We’re concentratingion the
relays for this one,” Banner said.
“It’s the last. meet of the year
and the guys are pretty tired.”

Assistant -. coach Jack Shaw

In _ agrees, saying, “These'guys‘are

in the position where they need
'a break. They've been running
. since when . . . ” -

run during the spring and sum.-..

who also run —cross-country com-

pete for -about nine months out» A

of a year.

Banner says he “wants to go
out and win the relays,” and he
‘will be packing the line-up with
someof his fine individual stars.’

 Tennis Team Rebuilds

Webster Needs Men Music Hall Saturday
To Beef Up Squad

by MIKE MILLER
"Defense is the best offense at certain levels," says Coach Fran

ﬁr

Webster. and he hopes to put this strategy to work on this year‘s tennis -

squad.

Webster. who is still looking for tennis candidates. has set rebuild-

ing as his main goal.

Webster is stressing defence
and he hopes to encourage the
squad to "play a game where they
think strategy wise.” ‘

“The biggest fault with college
players,” he says, “is that they
try to play too far above their
game. They should try to play ac-
cording to their ability and try to
improve gradually.”

After last years 0-13 season,
Webster hopes to bring the team
to a point where they can com-
pete with such schools as Penn
State, Bucknell, and West Vir-
ginia.

In addition. he hopes to imprve
the team’s morale. “Playing the
game is all right but in varsity
competition you have to play to
win.”

Coach Webster hopes to im-
prove to a point where he can at-
tract respectable players to Pitt
and gradually build the squad from
there. .

Bad weather has been hamper-

ing practice. but the team has

 

BOWLERS’ MARK DROPS

The bowling team won 112
points out of five on Saturday
against Geneva, dropping its
mark to 281/2-311/2.

The first game was a 923-923
tie, giving the team's their half
points. In the second game Ge-
neva won, 906-896.

Geneva also won the third
game, 887-852.

The bowlers won the fourth
game. 869-860, but lost the
point that is given for over-all
pins. -

Norm John led the Geneva
bowlers with a 791 in four
games and Bob Stefanon was
the Pitt high man with a 760.

 

Why should a traditional
club tie have the new
full fashion shape?

Only the new more luxurious full
fashion shape (fuller under-the-
knot, wider throughout) is right with
today's longer shirt collars, wider
jacket lapels. What's more, this
new full fashion shape is best cal-
culated to show off the luxurious
imported silks and dramatic pat-
terns of Resilio’s new giant c|ubs._

P.S. All Resilio ties have the new
full fashion shape.

The squad is still open to new
