Outstanding Senior
Man Hazards

A Few Opinions

By LEOPOLD KOEBERLEIN

After a student spends four
years oncampus it is generally
admitted that he_ has gained
enough experience, if he is dis.-
cerning, to arrive at some gen-
eral conclusions concerning the
University.

One such person who will
graduate next month is Albert J.
Barr, ‘BA. 8

A1 Barr, although you probably
knowthe gentleman and his ac-
tivities ‘need little repetition, is
President of ODK»and Phi Kappa;
hehas been manager of varsity
football for the past year; he has
held the post of vice-president and
has been on. the executive com-
mittee of Student Faculty Associa-
tion; and among other things, he
is a member of Scabbard and
Blade, military fraternity and of
Undergraduate Cap and Gown
Club. On activities tap day he
was designated the outstanding se-
nior man and awarded the ODK
Senior award.

Education. Broadens

take part in activities,” says Barr,
who should know, “are broadened

Commencement week activi-

alumni groups, according to the
schedule arranged by Univer-
sity officials for the period from
June 4 to June 8.

ating class are the baccalaureate
services, scheduled for Sunday,

exercises, set for Wednesday, June

in their general education. Fur-
thermore they will probably have
a greater appreciation for the Uni-
versity when they become alumni.”

But although he is one of the

most outstanding activities lead-'

ers on campus, he is deeply con-
cerned with the status of the edu-
cation program of the University.

One of his critcisms of the cur-
riculum is that it is too technical.
Freshmen, he believes, should be
subjected to a general cultural
survey course in order to give
them an acquaintance with a broad
ﬁeld of knowledge.

On thestatus of college spirit,
Barr hopesthat all students, upon
leaving, will look back with some
degree of pride in the University.
As for the presence of this spirit,
however, he feels that it is lack-
ing in a great degree among stu-
dents and ‘ ‘faculty members.
‘Faculty Discontent’.

Accountingifor this situation,
Barr places the blame on the lack
of adequate fa”cilities‘for students
and the feeling of insecurity of the
faculty. ' V ’

“A distinct effort,” he says,
“should be made to retain the
good professors -we have. One of

our major problems is faculty dis-A

content.”

Student - Faculty Association
next year‘ can accomplish much
toward eliminating student unrest
and providing a means of con-
tact between student ‘body and ad-
ministration, he -"claims, "especially
if the group of students ‘will act»
together -intelligently. ’

='Among the problems to be con-
sidered next year‘ by SFA, Barr
listed: improved‘ elevator facilities,
student cafeteria, and means" of
obtain-ingv an‘ understanding be-‘
tween - ~ ‘administration and stu-
dents. - a

Student To Trustees

"As Pal possible means of effecting
this understanding, ‘Barr suggested
that a representative from SFA be
empoweredand privileged to pre-
sent student attitudes before the
Board of Trustees. “By represent-
ing student -opinion to the trus-
tees,” Barr declared, “much of the
frictioncan ‘be eliminated. The
problems that exist, I feel, come

more from misunderstanding than‘

from any other source. If SFA au-
thority is extended and student
opinion is given a means of ex-
pression, a new harmony can be
found.”

Barr’s work as football mana-
ger has -given him ﬁrst hand con-
tact with the athletic situation. He
heartily approves ‘the new intra-
mural sports program to take the
place of formal gym classes next
year. “It may bring out talents
we have not yet discovered,” he
said.

‘Ready To Begin’

With respect to varsity athletics,
Barr declares in favor of a ﬁrst
rate football squad. “But,” he
says, “the athletic program should
tend to become more inclusive
than exclusive. Next year’s intra-
mural program, I feel, will facili-
tate that change.”

If the Panthers will meet the
predictionof this year’s manager,
they will‘-win-nine" out of their
ten contests next-year. “They may
drop »th”er.~Carnegie% Tech game,”
Barr declared.‘ =‘-‘Tech has im-
proved.*’V."v 2: .=~'~.« 9 3'

The signiﬁcance of the Univer-
sity to thesenior judged outstand-
ing memberjjof {his class was ex-
pressed te‘rsely.' and to the point.‘

“I feel now,”-.said, “that I‘

Physicist Gives
N 0n+TechniCa1
Lecture Friday

C. K. Christensen, of Clairton,
Pa., will give three demonstration
lectures on ultra-violet lights and
the associated phenomena of ﬂu-

orescence and phosphorescenc
Friday in 24 Cathedral. ’

The‘ ﬁrst lecture will be given
at 8:40 a. m. This lecture will be
repeated at 9:40 and 11:40 a. in.
Biology, chemistry, education, en-
gineering, and physics students
have been invited to attend the
lectures, which are non-technical.

Ultra-violet light is radiation
just beyond the range ofvision.
While it is invisible, it is capable
of exciting certain substances so
that they become producers of vis-
ible light. When the visible light
ceases with stoppage of the, ultra-
violet excitation, the phenomenon
is known as ﬁourescence.‘

If the visible light persists after
ultra-violet is shut off, it is known
as phosphorescence. These phe-
nomena have been used in the de-
tection of alteration in documents
and vworks of art, in the, recog-
nition of adulterants in commer-
cial products, and in distinguish-
ing between real and false gems.

Finals Take

Students Present
Persuasive T ype
Speeches Today

Discussions of economic plan-
ning, education, war, and govern-
mental reform programs will be
presented today by the ﬁve final-
ists in the annual University
speech contest, to be held at 2:30
o’clock in 204 Cathedral.

Chosen to appear in the ﬁnals
of the contest from a ﬁeld of 25
students who participated in the
preliminaries last Wednesday
were Jack Hoeveler, C40; Richard
Klemer, C38; Frederick Roth,
C41; William Stark, C38; and
Christopher Walthour, C39.

CASH PRIZES

All of the talks to be presented
by the ﬁnalists are of the persua-
sive type, and from eight to ten
minutes in length. Winner of the
contest will receive a prize of ten
dollars. Second prize is ﬁve dol-
lars.

“You say potatoes and I say
potahtoes” is the theme of Hoeve—
ler’s dissertation on the defeat of
the government reorganization
bill. He’ attacks the defeat of the
measure as a prime example of
political bickering and legislative
ineptitude.

Student attitude on the ques-
tion of war and ‘peace is the topic
of Klemer’s address. Roth, a
member of the freshman debating
squad, uses for his subject the
nationalistic tendencies of present
educational system, and the evil
results of such? training.

STARK ON PUDDLERS

I-n his address on “Hasty Pud-
dling,” Stark, varsity debate man-
ager, attempts to draw an analogy
between the case of puddlers in a
local steel mill and the members
of our present economic system.
He advocates ordered "economic
planning without undemocratic
regimentation.

By an analysis of the develop-
ment of judicial institutions, Wal-
thour defends the United States
Supreme ‘Court by attempting to
demonstrate the need for some
type of judicial body for ﬁnal re-
view of cases. " '

Psychologist Finds Blood Types

By SHERMAN POCHAPIN

According .to the ﬁndings of
Kenneth Taylor, interne in the
psychology department at the
Western Penitentiary, there is no
relation between blood types and
criminal tendencies. '

. Speaking at Psychology Forum
Monday afternoon, Mr. Taylor
gave a resume of blood-typing,
methods of typing, and ﬁnally, the
conclusions he reached as a result
of work he has done on 300 pris-
oners at the Western penitentiary.

EXPLAINS METHODS

Blood-typing dates back to 1899,
when an English physician dis-
covered iso-haemo-agglutination,
or the clotting of the red blood
cells. There are several different
methods of typing blood now in
use. All the Pittsburgh hospitals
with the exception of one use the
In his work at the
penitentiary Mr. Taylor, used a
routine worked out by the U. S.
Army, and which is commonly
known as the International Sys-
tem.

In this system, Mr. Taylor ex-
plained the four types of blood are
known as the A. B. O. and AB
types. Red cells in the blood exist

Collembolae
Ends Season

With Field Trip

Winding up the year’s activi-
ties, Collembolae, honorary natu-

ral science fraternity, will hold its
ﬁnal dinner meeting tomorrow at
6:30 o’clock in 1017 Cathedral, and
a ﬁeld trip to Indian Creek, Sun-
day.

Dr. R. T. Hance, professor of
biology, will speak at tomorrow’s
meeting. He.will discuss “Science
is as Science Does.” At this meet-
ing, the annual Collembolae book-
let will be released and new oili-
cers will be elected.

Two Cold Spring Harbor schol-_
arships will be awarded and a reel
of movies of the_ Kon-O-Kwee
ﬁeld tripwill be shown to climax
the meeting. «

Arrangements for the ﬁeld trip
originally called for Dr. Samuel
H. Williams, professor of biology,

. to lead the group. Since he is un-
- able to make the trip, plans are

being made for a substitute leader.

The site of the ﬁeld trip, Indian
Creek, is famous for its natural
collecting grounds. ;

Those interested in making the
trip are requested to sign up on
the bulletin board in front of 1009
Cathedral.

YM-YWHA Honors
Seniors At Dinner

Honoring seven seniors at the
University, the annual YMHA
student banquet will be held at
6:30 o’clock tomorrow in the Y
building, Belleﬁeld street.

Those being feted include: Flor-
ence Hiller, Herman Foreman,
Norman Gordon, Sylvia Schwartz,
Ruth Schwartz, Ellis Abrams, and
Esther Robins, all students in the
College.

Bill l\/Iazefsky, C40, next year’s
Y president, will preside over the
banquet. Dancing will follow in
the ballroom. Milton K. Susman,
editor of the Jewish Criterion, will
act as toastmaster.

Engineers Hold
Banquet Tonight

The University chapter of the
American Institute of Electrical
Engineers will hold its 18th an-
nual banquet _at 6:30 o’clock at
the College club, with Dr. E. B.

§Roberts, assistant to the vice-.

president of Westinghouse Elec-
tric & Mfg. company as the prin-
cipal speaker.

Richard C Matlack, EE38, chair-
man of the banquet, announces

.that E. A. Holbrook, dean of the
ISchool of Engineering and Mines,

will also give a short talk. Walter
Brown, EE38, will be the toast-
master.

under the exertion of two forces.
One force, mutual repulsion due
to a like electrical charge, is even-
ly matched by the other force, sur-
face tension.‘ The slightest dis-
turbance of this equilibrium re-
sults in agglutianation, which
brings on death inside of one min-
ute after its onset.
RELATES USES

“Blood typing has several varied
uses, the most important of which
are transfusions, establishment of
true parents in criminal cases, in
the establishment of pure racial
groups in anthropology, and in
crime detection. Dried blood over
a year old can be typed and traced
to the person from whom it came,”
said Mr. Taylor.

For his study, Mr. Taylor check-
ed blood types against standard
averages for an equal number of
men, against their mental ages,
which, incidentally, averaged 13
years, ﬁve months, against the
number of recitivists, the standard
of rectivity, and even against the
average ages for the recitivists.
Nowhere could a clue be found
that might point to an signiﬁcant
factor between blood types and
criminality.

Swells Active Roll

Kappa Sigma increased its
pledge roll recently by the addi-
tion of three more men, Ed Doty,
Jack Redding, and Tom Dillon. A
few days later it was shortened
again when initiation ceremonies
were held for Ben Kish, Ed Doty,
George Tanner, and Joe Trutz.

And the boys are still talking
about their wonderful Spring

Tri Dclts Plan
Panhellenic Bridge

News of something very spe-
cial and entertaining for all fra-
ternity women on campus reach-
es us by way of the Tri Dclts.
These girls are inviting guests
representing every woman’s fra-
ternity to a dessert bridge party
at their house next Saturday aft-
ernoon from 1 o’clock to 4:30.
This sounds like a New Deal for
Panhel, and really ought to be
fun.

It happened a long time ago,
but did not come to our atten-
tion until recently that the Tri
Dclts had initiated nine in their
latest rituals. The new full-
ﬂedged sisters are Estelle Stout,
Grace Stollar, Betty Clokey,
Frances Hewes, Audrey Mc-
Laren, Betty Davis, Anita Bren-
ner, Peggy Dent, and Jeanne
Culver.

 

 

Dancing Classes
Plan Fun For Friday

Dancing, a ﬂoor show, cookies

ﬂoor show, Ralph Myers is busy
getting his entertainers -- Bob
Johns, Audrey McLaren, Ellen and
Clare Williams, and Miss Frentzel
—-ready for some unusual per-
formances. Even the dance pro-
grams will be a bit novel, we hear.

A Thorough Rehauling Goes
Virtually Unnoticed

By Leonard Levison

Sports Editor

In the course of the past two semesters some rather ‘strin-
gent inodiﬁcationswere wrought 111 the mould of athletics at
the University and they were attended by considerable news-

paper hullabaloo, particularly in

the columns of tlie local dailies.

This was carried on to such a degree that the “Hagan Plan”
and subsequent “Code Bowman” became local catchwords.
But, generally overlooked and certainly unaccompanied by

any pulp blatancy was an announcement appearing in the news

columns of the Pitt News on Fri-9

day.
=1: *

And it was of more signiﬁcant
import to the positive athletic pol-
joy at Pitt than anything that has
been formulated and eﬁected in
the past decade.

=I<

According to the news item,
“Substitution of participation in
intramural games and athletics
for the former required physical
education course will be inaugu-
rated in September, University
«officials announced today.”

=I-' * *

Even the significance was miss-
ed in the general reporting of the
story. For this recent decision of
the Board of Trustees which fol-
lowed a recommendation by the
Faculty Committee on athletic
policy was more than just a
change in the nature of the re-
quired freshman gym class.

=I= * *

Of course it was a welcome
change in that respect for it has
provided a more appealing gym
program. Freshmen will have
their choice of playing any one or
any amount of the close to thirty
sports provided? in the new set-up.
This is certainly something to be
desired and something that will
meet with wholehearted approval.

However, the point that was
overlooked was the fact that
Jimmy Hagan’s athletic depart-
ment will have complete juris-
diction _over.th-e functioning of the
reincarnated intramurals. There-
in lies the significance.

5 =I‘- * 916

Not only has the scope of intra-
mural athletics at Pitt been
broadened, but a new administra-
tional day has dawned. Intra-
mural athletics now becomes one
of the chief elements in Pitt
athletic policy.

=I=

*

* =14

*
The idea, being a Hagan orig-
ination at the University, will

:3

quite naturally have the full
strength of Hagan’s department
behind it. Placed in charge of

the program will be the’ various‘

minor athletic coaches on the Pitt
staff.
=I= 31% II:
The Hagan plan of attack will
be to make the program as big and
as extensive as it is possible to
make it, and he has visioned no
stopping point. It is his ambition,
and one of unquestioned merit, to
have every student at the Uni-
versity participating in some form

of athletic exercise.
ﬁt: *

Towards this end he has laid
the groundwork The Board of
Trustees has given official consent
to the pursuance of such a pol-
icy. Beginning September the in-
tramurals will get under their all-

embracing way.
=1: =l< *

Thus the Pitt athletic depart-
ment is vested with a new pol-
icy, has a new guiding key to-
wards its striving.

-Comment on the worth of such
a plan is entirely unnecessary. It
is recognized in more enlighten-
ed educational circles as the only
thing to do and it is a forward
step toward true athletic appreci-
ation.

>2‘-

>l¢

=1: :16

The idea of “sports for all”
strikes at the root of a situation
in which this country unfortunate-
ly ﬁnds itself. Thousands turn out
to watch others in athletic partici-
pation, their only indulgence be-
ing through the vicarious nature
of a spectator._ A

>I<

More than a word of commend-
ation is in order to Jimmy Hagan
for the institution of a progressive
athletic policy. Maybe the pro-
gressivism of the athletic depart-
ment will be picked up in the
other administrational divisions
of the University.

Panthers Grab Every City Title

During Year’s Competition

By BILL MAZEFSKY
’l‘lie. genial Mr. Frank Carver was talking sports (the genial
Mr. Fzanlc Carver is, always talking sports—-except when he ’s
talking golf), and while he talked, he tinkered with a pencil

and a pad of paper.

However,

Mr. Frank Carver, is not the

type of tinkerer that ﬁll o’s or draws endless circles; there is a

purpose to his doodling.

His conversation and pencil work dove-tailed.
discussed the past season of Pitt?

‘While he

athletic activities, Carver (we’ll
drop the Mr. for the sake of in-
formality) outlined the Panther
triumphs and came up with the
opinion that the Pitt teams had
swept clean every city title. Not
since I92’? had Pitt so overloaded
the trophy case.
FOOTBALL LEADS

The tbotball ‘ team steam-roller-,
ed through the season, cutting
down Ohio Wesleyan, West Vir-
ginia. Duquesne, Notre Dame, Ne-
braska, Carnegie Tech, Penn
State’, Duke, Wisconsin, and play-
ing the annual scoreless tie with
Fordharn...

Despite their truancy from the
Rose Bowl game, Pitt was gener-
ally conceded the National foot-,
ball championship. The Panther:
eleven also received the Lambert
trophy, symbolic of the Eastern
football championship, and wel-
comed back to the trophy case the
battered city championship cup
that ‘cad made a twelve month so— ;'
journ on the Duquesne hilltop. I

The Pitt basketball team never}
quite caught up to its potentiali-Q
ties. Carlson’s five knocked off‘:
the Tartans twice and split with;
Duquesne to win the city cham-E
pionship in basketball. However,I
the rest. of their record was spotty, I
and this was not one of Pitt’s bet- ,
ter years on the basketball courts. 3

‘ NOT MANY TROPHIES I

Pitt has no cup or trophy that’
can be held‘ responsible for the
city championship in wrestling,
boxing, cross-country, track, orl
swimming. It ‘seems that no one ,l

ever got around to ordering the
cup. .

Yet the cross-country team ran
faster over the country-side than
the Tech thin-clads, and ﬁnished
with a record of one win and no
losses in city competition. The
Dukes have no team. Pitt boxers
battered out the Eastern confer-
ence title, and Panther swimmers
won the ‘ Eastern Intercollegiate.

If anyone wants to stake claims,
they can point to these two wins
as evidence of Panther boxing and
swimming premiership in the city.
The wrestling title falls into the
Panther
Tech and Duquesne
grappling team.

HOCKEY CONTROVERSIAL

The hockey situation is a matter
of controversy. Pitt won two
games, and Duquesne won two
games. If you can outargue your
friend from Duquesne, bring up
the matter of the city, hockey ti-
tle; otherwise talk about football.

Pitt and Tech track teams don’t
meet and Duquesne has no track
team. But Pitt ca-n lay claims to
any mythical track title for this
area. Olson’s cindermen are in
the throes of one of the most suc-
cessful track campaigns in Panth-
er history, and will not lose any
dual meets this season.

The golf and tennis teams are in
mid-season and you can’t quite
claim any titles until the season
is over. .~..However, when the golf
and tennis seasons are over, it’s a
good bet that these" two titles will
be on the Panther belt. I

Lions, drop in for an afternoon
of running, jumping, and heav-
ing that may establish a favor-
ite for the IC4A games, slated for
June 3-4 in New York.

ALL-DAY MEET

Saturday’s dual meet between,
the Panthers and Lions will fea-.

ture an all-day track and ﬁeld car-
nival at the Pitt Stadium, for in
addition to the varsity meet there
will be a battle between the two
freshmen outﬁts, as well as the
annual W. P. I. A. L. champion-
ship, with thirty or forty high
schools competing.

After a long winter and spring
campaign in the East and Mid-
West the Panthers will be pointing
for the defense of their 1937 IC4A
title and the Penn State meet will
be the ﬁnal test before those
games. Pitt will face the starting
gun in the familiar favorite role,
but the scoringwill be close all the
way.

LIONS STRONG

Lion strength is concentrated in
the two hurdles, javelin, and dis-
cus, and they will battle Pitt on
even terms in the high jump, pole
vault, and distance runs. The
Staters will not be shut out in the
sprints and middle distances, Pitt’s
forte.

However, the Olsonmen will
look to the sprints, 440, 880, and
broad-jump for an edge in the
scoring. Captain Edgar Mason
and Frank Ohl have managed to
veer the sprints to the Panther
side of the ledger all season and
Saturday should prove no excep-
tion. The 440 and 880 will be
swept by Pitt with Ferrara, Ohl,
and McKee doing the sweeping in
the quarter, and Woodruff and Mc-
kee handling the assignment in the
half.

OHL BROAD JUMPS

Handy-man Ohl will take the
broad-jump and Ed Routch and
Frank Kristl will back the Ohl
play. Walter Sterner, who led the
pack to the tape against Temple in
the two mile run, will be counted
-on to add pointage against Penn
State in this event.

Bauer and Frazier, two of the
best hurdlers in the East, will
make Kenny Ryden do some fast
stepping to rescue a second for
Pitt. Vukmanic, another State
star, will have little trouble win-
ning the javelin. Vukmanic won
the toss at the Penn Relays, and
every time he lets fly the javelin
one or more records are jeopar-
dized.

Pitt N et Team
Beat Crovers,

Plays In Capital

Grove City, playing a return
match on the Trees Courts, was
shut out for the second time this
season by the Pitt racqueteers,
9-0. Today the Panthers meet
George Washington in Washing-
ton and tomorrow they battle
Georgetown

Only two of the net tilts were
extended over the minimum of
two sets. In the singles events
Dudley Weiss was forced into
three sets before checking the
Grovers’ McDowell, 6-0, 5-7, 6-1,
and in tandem play McKenna and
Mogan lost their second set while
defeating Miller and Moorhead,
6-0, 3-6, 6-2.

Pitt’s Captain Bob Bald drop-
ped McCloskey, 6-3, 6-4; Joe Kris-
tufek whitewashed Bingham, 6-0;
MCK-enna bettered Moorhead, 6-1,
6-4; Hartman downed Campbell,
6-2, 6-1.

In the doubles play Bald and
Kristufek teamed to lace Grove
City's Mccloskey and Bingham
and Weiss and Kaufman cooperat-
ed to set back Frew and Camp-

bell.

Mark down Saturday, June
5, on the back of your cuff as
the big day for intra-mural
baseball.

On that day, an old Pitt cus-

tom will be dusted 0E and
given the spotlight again, the
custom of a homecoming day
during Commencement Week for
the graduated baseball players.

Since there is no Pitt varsity
team to give the Alumni a scrap,
a team of outstanding players,
gathered from the various clubs in
the Intra-Mural League will rep-
resent the Panthers against the
old grads.

HAGAN ON ALUMNI

The Alumni outﬁt has not yet
been assembled, but it will prob-
ably include
athletic greats as Jimmy Hagan

burgh Pirate hurler.

I Dents.

The All—Star team will probably
offer a fair cross-section of next.
year’s varsity. When the club is
picked either late this week or
early next week, there will be
more than ample material for
selection

Pitching should be the strongest
point. On the basis of their per-
formances thus far, the twirling
staff will probably be selected
from such standouts as Brown,
Engineers; Holt, Rover Boys; Kish
and ‘Scarfpin, Scotts; Spotovich,
Olsons; Straloski, Phys .Ed. Frosh;
Timko, Scrantonians, Urban, Phi
Kappa; Troy, Phys. Ed. Sophs;
and Laucick, Kappa Alpha Phi.

BETTER INFIELDERS

Among the better inﬁelders are
Ptacek, Phys. Ed. Sophs; Hol-
brook, Phys
houser, Service; Quarantillo,
Dents; Stapulis, Olsons; Hughes,
Diablos; Kocheran, Phys. Ed.
Frosh; and Walters, Pharmacy. I

The leading ﬂy chasers of the
league seem to be Sleber, Frosh
Football; Irvine, Kappa Alpha
Phi; Lanuti, Dents; Fullerton,
Scotts; Wilson, Phi Kaps; and
Chickerneo, Scotts. Hughes, Dia-
blos, has also done a ﬁne job when
he has been called upon to play
in the outer line of defense.

The receiving end of the bat-
tery has practically been narrow-
ed to Rettinger, Phys. Ed. Frosh;
Gradisak, Frosh Football; and
Hanna, Pharmacy.

FACULTY EXCLUSIVE

That members of the Faculty
have been left out of the rating
should not be taken as a slight,
since the Faculty outﬁt is con-
sidered in a class by itself.

Two outstanding games are
scheduled this afternoon. In the
ﬁrst of these, the Phys Ed. Frosh
meet the Engineers up on the hill
at 3:30. Straloski and Brown
should wage an interesting pitch-
ing battle, but the superior hit-
ting of the Frosh will probably
turn the match in their direction.

OTHER BIG GAME

The other big game of the day
has the Faculty opposing Kappa
Alpha Phi in the 5 o’clock match
at the Stadium. It will'be the
lFacu1ty’s balanced
pitching, and remarkable luck
against KAP’S tight defense, ﬁne
pitching, and none—too strong
stickwork.

In the other games, the Chem.
Sophs rate the nod over the al-
most hopeless Chem. Frosh in the
second football practice ﬁeld game,
and the Diablos will try to over-
come a Weak outfield and top the
Chem. Specials in the 6:30 Sta-
dium setto.

Tomorrow, the Frosh Football-
ers begin the action as the favor-
ites over the ROTC on the foot-
‘ball practice ﬁeld at 3:30. The
Rovers and the Pre-Dents meet
in the second match on the hill at
5 o’clock.

DIABLOS PLAY SECOND

The Diablos play their second
game in two dayswhen they tan-
gle with the Dithridge Aristocrats
at 5 on the Stadium diamond. The
two hardest-hitting teams in the
league come together on the same
ﬁeld at 6:30 as the Scotts try to
outslug the Phi Kaps.

Only two games are scheduled
Friday, both on the football prac-
tice ﬁeld. The Phys. E. Frosh and
the Pharmacy meet at 3:30 in an
important battle. At 5:00 the
Chem. Seniors tee off on the Cfiem.
Sophs

Instead of the four games sched-
uled last Monday, two were play-
ed. The Rover Boys forfeited to

the Chem. Specials failed to show

Match For Pitt

Having lost their chances for
the Eastern Intercollegiate Golf
Championship at Princeton over"
the week-end, Pitt’s golfers will
go through the motions for the
rest of the season as they play
West Virginia tomorrow afternoon
and Carnegie Tech Saturday.

The Panther golfers have al-
ready beaten the Mountaineers

and Tartans decisively, so there
isn’t much to look forward to on
that score.

Last week-end Pitt was defeat-

town, 6-3, eliminating them from
Conference competition. Penn
was Pitt’s only victim, losing to
the Panthers by a .7 to 2 score.

counter to give them four victor-
ies and one defeat, the setback
coming from the Delts.

PiLams, PiKA, SAE, and Sig-

League A is engaged in a wide
open race. At the present time
Phi Kappa and the Phi Eps are
leading with three and two vic-
tories and one setback. How-
ever, two of the three wins have
been protested due to illegal
pitching by the Kappa Sigma
twirler, Reddinger.

Mr. Corley and Mr. Rooker
checked up on the Kappa Sigma
pitcher and both state his delivery
is illegal. A meeting will be held
with the fraternities who have en-
tered protests, and it wouldn’t be
surprising in the least to see the

The case in point is the Marvin Duke inci-
dent, wherein the baseball club bought Duke, a
pitcher from the Montreal Club of the Interna-
tional League, on an option basis; a thousand
down, and ten thousand dollars if the option
was picked up.

Duke is at the zenith of his baseball career.
He is 29 years old, had spent eight years in the
minor leagues, and had won 21 games last year
in an extremely fast league——a league which
was led last year by the New York Yankees’
farm club at Newark.

Duke Won 21 games, started 29, and ﬁnished
23 of them, a remarkable record, especially
when it is considered that of the 22 games
played thus far by the Pirates this season, only
‘four pitchers have been able to start’ and ﬁnish

Dr- 
Revises TeXtb<>0k

By Melvin Rogow

Dr. Carroll R. Daugherty, professor of economics,
and labor economist, has revised his text book on
“Labor Problems in American Industry.”

The revisions in this'Vbook," unlike ‘most book re-
visions which, as students have discovered, are a
book pub1isher’s racket, have been far-reaching and
necessary. A ’ ' ‘

The Labor picture in America has been changing
with kaleidoscopic rapidity since the first edit-ioniof
the book in 1933. Since then, the emergence of
the CIO group of unions, and the entrance of the
government into the Labor picture," have‘ come close‘
to changing the entire Labor relations ﬁeld." ‘

Called Outstanding Text

This book, called“ by Dr. Selig Perlman, professor
at Wisconsin university and government labor rela-
tions expert, “perhaps the "outstanding textbook in
existence,” has had wide circulation "among colleges
and universities in America. Used by 'approx'imate-
ly 160"schools last-year, in the ﬁve years of its
existence through four editions, it has ‘been used by
over 200 different institutions. ' V

Dr. Daugherty’s style is at once intensely objec-
tive, and informal. For a somewhat technicalgfield,
the book never loses interest, and can be well ‘un-
derstood by laymen. ‘It has ’been‘called,‘in fact, "‘a
Bible in labor economics.” - A V

Duke was taken to the Pittsburgh training
camp, where he showed better than any other
rookie or ‘veteran in training camp games. The
season started, and in the month that Duke was
a member’of the team he did not pitch a. single
inning for the Pirates. This, remember, in spite
of the fact that only four pitchers completed
games that they started. V V V

And so, Duke was released. And therein
hangs a tale. ’ V

Criticism of the Pirate owners must come on
two points: (a) The Duke case as an isolated
instancepand (b) The baseball system as an
American institutionf V V ‘

(a) Duke is now 29 years old, comparatively
aged" as baseball players go. It is not likely
that he will ever get another chance in the
major leagues, the pinnacle for which all ball
playersustrive. He apparently has something
on the b_all or he would not have been able to
win 21 games in such a fast league.’ "He was
given no ‘chance with the Pirates in spite of his
reput'a_tion. -

The ‘Vdowntown papers have been criticizing
the manager (Traynor) for not giving Duke a
chance,‘ but it is our opinion that Traynor took
his orders from the front office. He was told in
other words, not‘ to pitch Duke, since if he
made a good showing, the fans would demand
that he be kept, andpthel money outlay would
have been too much. V’ V V V"

Andso,‘ it wasdecided that Duke should be
sent back to minors, practically a death knell
in his case, without being given a chance. A
perfect example of sportsmanship that we hope‘
will be remembered when Pittsburgh baseball
club owners begin to alibi for not‘ winning the
National League pennant this year.

(b) The Duke case serves to bring to light
a system which is amazing in view of the fact
that baseball is called by its publicity agents
as “the great American game.” * '

This game, as it is now set‘ up now amounts
to involuntary servitude in its worst 
Players are bought and sold, t‘ra.de”d. and dis-
Vinissed with no regard to their wishes. '

TheV answer to this, according to the leagues,
is that no player has to accept‘ the contract of-
fared him by the club. Which is not an
answer. ”

The player has nothing whatever to do if he
doesn’t accept the contract oﬁered him. He
has nowhere to go.

Organized baseball lines are drawn so tight
that he becomes an outcast upon refusal to sign ‘ _ _ _ _

The importanceV of oil in int

the world are emphasized by the

Mexico, U. S., England

Form Eternal Triangle

U. S. To Keep Faith With Monroe Doctrine
Or Align With Britain Against Mexico

By Joseph McCIoskVey V

er-national relations in the Ma-

chine Age and the increasing interdependence of the nations of

present “crisis” over Mexico ’s

expropriation of foreign holdings in oil.
Since President Cardenas’ order for the nationalization of

oil with provisions for the com—¢
pensation of the interests affected,
tension between Mexico and the
United States and England has
been increasing. A climax was
reached last-week-end when Mex-
ico recalled her diplomatic repre-
sentative in London.

“Now the United States ﬁnds her-
self in an anything but an envia-
ble position. Several groups in
this country have lobbied persis-
tently for American interference
in Mexican domestic affairs. Re-
ligious groups. have sought aid for
churches whose land was expro-
priated.

ACTION DEMANDED

Oil interests have gone so far as
to demand armed intervention. A
few imperialists of the old school
still regard Mexico as the legiti-
mate ground for future expansion
of the United States.

The demands of these groups
run counter to the avowed policy
of the good neighbor which has
marked Pan—American diplomacy
during the last two decades. South
and Central American nations
have had reason to doubt the sin-
cerity of the United States; the
handling of this situation will do
much either to cement or to rup-
ture such friendship as does exist.

At the same time, America is

negotiating a reciprocal trade
agreement with Britain, and may
be willing to go far in aiding
British interests in Mexico in the
hope of securing favorable con-
cessions in the trade pact. Should
Britain choose to takestrong steps
in Mexico, however, she will run
afoul of the Monroe Doctrine.
COLLAPSE FEARED

In such a situation it is’ little
wonder that the American State
Department is said ‘to be “dis-
turbed” over the Mexican situa-
tion. '

Much more important in the
present crisis is the possible effect
of the embargo which has been
thrown up against Mexican oil by

The success of student publications, ﬁnancially,
directly depends upon the students. The money paid
by the student for his copies is triﬂing compared to the

The important source of revenue comes from advertis-

Local merchants are always willing and ready to
advertise as long as they feel their advertisements are
