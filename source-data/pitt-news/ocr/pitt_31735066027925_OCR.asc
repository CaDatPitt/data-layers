Candidate discusses
youth exodus, Bigelow

O'Connor on boulevard: Chancellor
Nordenberg is making a big'mistol(e

ﬂBen'amin Jackson

   

Mayoral candidate Bob O’Connor came to Pitt yester-
day and offered students his thoughts on improving
Pittsburgh as well as the problems with the Bigelow com-
promise.

The Business Student Council sponsored a talk by the
city councilman last night. O’Connor spoke to about 30 stu-
dents in the ballroom of the William Pitt Union.

O’Connor opened with a 15-minute statement, then
opened the ﬂoor to questions and discussion about the var-
ious issues facing Pittsburgh in this election.

Two topics dominated the discussion: keeping young
people in Pittsburgh and the Bigelow Boulevard compro-
mise.

“Our young people are leaving
because of the [lack of] jobs,”
O’Connor said. His solutions included
creating more housing for young peo-
ple and new families and bringing in
more businesses.

“When businesses come in, we
should roll out the red carpet,”
O’Connor said. “Most politicians are
not business—friendly.”

The councilman went on io say
that one of the solutions for the problems of city neighbor-
hoods would be to develop business and use the govem—
ment to create opportunity for business.

“If you can make a community safe and clean, people
will go there. I think that’s what government should do.”

O’Connor claimed the city’s budgetary problems could
be handled with a better accounting system to make busi-
nesses pay their taxes. He also said that some of the institu-
tions which are tax—exempt should makes deals with the
city to provide services and help make up for the lost tax
base.

He stressed the point that young people need to be
involved in the whole process of city government.

“Your input is very important,” O’Connor said. “Young
people start the trends.”

Switching topics, O’Connor brought up an issue much
closer to the minds of many Pitt students: Bigelow

 

O’Connor

I Boulevard.

While the discussion was subdued, O’Connor did say
that he thought the timing surrounding the whole issue was
extremely poor.

“I warned the chancellor, ‘I think you’re making a mis-
take.’ I like him. You guys have got a nice young chancel-
lor,” O’Connor said. “I thought it put Pitt against the neigh-
borhood, Pitt against the businesses.”

O’Connor went on to say that he thought the whole
compromise was only a deal to hurt his mayoral campaign

Committee has yet to make decision
Fate of gradute programs still undecided by advisory board

Cesca Antonelli

   
 

Even after meeting Tuesday after-
noon, the advisory committee helping
decide the fate of some graduate pro-
grams remains in the dark about when
their proposal will be finished or
when they will next meet to discuss
1t.

Members of the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences committee seemed
upbeat about the review process, but
said that they are unsure about the
timeline of events to come.

“We met [Tuesday], and beyond
that, it’s not settled on precisely when
the next meeting will be, unless
someone didn’t tell me,” said David
Gauthier, a committee member.

Though no further meetings have
yet been set, members say that the
tempo of the proceedings is starting
to pick up.

“It’s going to move very rapidly

People say Marquette Bowman is a
very giving person who is truly concerned
with helping others with his fatherly
advice. SGB members say they go to him
with their problems and often refer to him
as “Dad.”

“My philosophy is always keep a
smile and a positive attitude, and you will
get through everything,” he said.

Though a positive attitude still won’t
cure the common cold or automatically
grant you a perfect grade—point average,
just sitting and talking to Bowman is
enough to make your day a little easier to
take.

Board member Christa Douaihy said
that is typical of Bowman, who constantly
keeps spirits up in the office.

“Marquette is wonderful.” she said.
“He constantly puts other concerns ahead
of his own. He is truly a giving person.”

The senior economics major ran for

now. We’ll have a draft very soon,
then it goes to the provost,” Seymour
Drescher said.

FAS Dean Peter Koehler said that
the proposal has been started.

“At this point, we’re working to
finish the draft,” Koehler said. “I
don’t have a date that I can give.
We’re trying to get a meeting togeth-
er.” '

After the advisory committee
concludes, the draft will be forwarded
to the FAS Planning and Budget
Committee. Members of the PBC said
that they have received no indication
of when they can expect to see the
proposal.

“I had thought the [advisory com-
mittee] was done,” said Dan Schoos,
a PBC member. “I have heard no
word from the dean as to when the
PBC will meet. I doubt it will be this
week as a result [of the delay]. We
may not see this stuff until next

the position of SGB member last fall
because of his interest in public policy and
government on the national level.
Growing up in Washington, D.C., also put
the news and the government in the fore-
front for Bowman.

Even though he had no prior experi-
ence in student government or any other
organization on campus, Bowman still
decided to run last fall — and won.

“I saw problems on this campus, and
I wanted to change things,” he said. “I
really didn’t think that I would win. I think
that my position on this board shows that
you really don‘t need great qualiﬁcations

Senate Republicans will get
approval for funding probe

- Across the Nation

PITTSBURGH —— A proposal by HOK
Sports on improving Three Rivers
Stadium L was considered by the
Pittsburgh Planning Commission yes—
terday. ‘ ‘

The ideas include adding new retail
stores, a restaurant, and a small brew-
pub. Stadium Authority Board
Chairman Mark Schneider says
improvements like the shops and brew-
pub could generate income for the city
before a new stadium could be built.

Schneider also said that some of the
ideas like the glassed-inrestaurant may
not be approved if a new stadium is
built. The proposed restaurant would
take up 13,000 square feet.

Senate

WASHINGTON  

Republicans will most likely be granted"

the approval needed in the Senate to
launch an investigation that will focus
solely on illegal fund—raising for the
1996 presidential and congressional
campaigns.

Fred Thompson of Tennessee will
lead the probe. A spokesman for
Thompson’s committee says espionage,
the inﬂuence of foreign money, money
laundering, and quid—pro—quo donations
will be included in the probe. But the
investigation will exclude most of the
$263 million in party—building contri-
butions collected by both parties.

Democrats say Republicans are
doing this simplyvto bash their “fund-
raising efforts,” but the Republican
leaders are promising a fair investiga-
tion.

ABERDEEN, Md. —- An NAACP
leader says four female Army recruits
will recant charges that they were raped
by their instructors at the Aberdeen

Proving Ground in Maryland. The
women will appear at a news confer-
ence with two of the accused.

Maryland chapters of the NAACP
have called for an independent investi-
gation of the sexual—misconduct scan-
dal at Aberdeen. The investigation is in
response to allegations made by the
four white females against their black
instructors. The civil rights group says
the Army has unfairly targeted black
soldiers based on the complaints of
white recruits.

Janice Grant says the women made

the accusations to avoid prosecution for

having consensual sex with their supe-
riors. There are currently seven drill
instructors that have been charged with
sexual harassment, rape, or consensual
sex with recruits. About a dozen others
are either under investigation or have
already “faced administrative sanc-
tions.”

The polymer coating works by

successfully in short-term experiments
on rabbits.

Students looking for a good deal on
a spring—break trip got a little more than
they were bargaining for last week:
thousands were stranded in paradise.

The grounding of an airline left stu-
dents from around the nation, including
Pitt, all packed up in places like Cancun
and the Bahamas with no way to get
back to the United States. \

The travel agency that booked the
vacation plan for most of the marooned
Pitt students was Take a Break Student
Travel out of Boston, Mass.

The company was scampering to
get its customers back home as recently
as Monday, Mar. 10.

“[Customers] have called us every-
thing from the letter A to the letter Z,”
said Alexander Morris, a Take a Break
customer—service representative.
“We’re working hard to get things cor-
rected.” S

Morris explained that the FAA’s
grounding of their contracted carrier,
AV Atlantic, left students taking ﬂights
to various connecting airports. He said
Take a Break was attempting to get
them from those locations to their
schools by whatever means possible.

Though the company began search-
ing for alternate flights home for its cus-
tomers, many opted to find ﬂights back
on their own because of the often one-
or-two-day—long delays.

This caused scattered sunbaked
vacationers to spend hundreds of dollars
more on their trips than they expected

to, but Morris said he expects no impact
on his company from this problem.

“This has nothing to do with us
directly,” said’ Morris, who also said the
blame rests on AV Atlantic.

FAA spokesman Bob Ropelewski
said that is not necessarily the case.

Ropelewski said that a contract
exists between the student and the trav-
el broker, leaving the broker ultimately
responsible to its customers. Trying to
ﬁnd a cheaper way to transport students
is the risk these brokers take.

“They can use whoever they want,”
said Ropelewski. “The lowest bidder
usually wins out.”

AV Atlantic was grounded by an
emergency order of suspension issued

by the FAA on Mar. 7 because of over, '

100 safety infractions by the carrier.
Ropelewski also said this was not
AV Atlantic’s first trouble with the
FAA. They were shut down last May for
similar infractions.
The long list of AV Atlantic’s
infractions included such items as:
- Inadequate, inoperative, or
missing safety devices
- lnoperative minimum equipment
list items
° Flight attendants improperly
trained and lacking required
competency checks and current
manuals
0 Improperly logged maintenance
discrepancies
Ropelewski said the airline would
be grounded until it meets the require-
ments but most likely would not face an
FAA fine.

week.”

Koehler said he did not know
when he would be meeting with the
PBC. “We’re struggling hard to get
this done, and it’s not so easy,” he said.

The plan is being crafted through
discussions between Koehler and the
committee. According to committee
members, Koehler is not writing the
actual draft, but neither are they.

“We’ve proceeded in different
ways. too complex to describe,”
Gauthier said. “It’s a draft that will
come from the committee, andwe will
certainly see it and approve it before it
goes further.”

Gauthier would not comment fur-
ther. Drescher said that, as of
Wednesday afternoon, there was no
written plan.

“I think it’s going to give [the
PBC] real food for thought,” he said.
“It will be a very serious document. I
say ‘it will’ because we don’t have a
document yet.”

 

Katheryn Linduff, another mem-
ber, agreed, saying that the talks were
not over. “We had a big discussion,
and. we’ll all be discussing it all
along,” she said. '

Committee members declined
comment on the probability of specific
cuts or elimination of certain pro-
grams, but said that the plan would
include some reductions.

“The University administration
has been expecting budget cuts, and
not just from FAS, from throughout
the University,” Gauthier said. “And
really one question is how best to
absorb these cuts so that [they] will not
adversely affect our programs.”

The group also agreed that mem-
bers have worked well together during
these proceedings.

“The process is going well,”
Drescher said. “I like the committee
very much. We seem to be on the same
wavelength. It seems to going very
smoothly.”

Chancellor Nordenberg’s
. inaugural address begs
comparison with former
Pitt heads: Do speeches
reflect true vision?

Benjamin Jackson

 

in over two hundred years of existence, Pitt

has had only l7 presidents/chancellors.The most_

recent, Mark N orclenberg, was fonnally installed
at this year's honors convocation on Feb. 28.
Each of the last three Chancellors waited
some period of time before his selection and offi-
cial installment, and each gave a keynote speech

9 at his installation in which he tried to set forth a

vision for the University. The remarks of the two
who preceded Nordenberg and their actual
accomplishments are telling and give some clue
to what Pitt might see from the current chancel-
lor over the course of his tenure.

While the speeches have gone on as long as
11 pages, the actual substance of the speeches
varies and tends to be much less.

It was in March of 1968 when President
Wesley Wentz Posvar began what would become
one of the longest university presidencies of any
institution.

This was the year of the Tet Offensive and
widespread student protests. Apathy was as

- much of a buzzword then as it is now, so much so

that The Pitt News literally decided to drop the
word from its pages just to insure variety.

These were troubled and changing times,
perhaps more chaotic than our own. Yet the com-
mon thread is that the world was on the cusp of

' great change.

Posvar seemed to recognize the point in his-
tory at which he took over the University, and his
speech reﬂected that. At the same time, it was not
a speech of high-ﬂown rhetoric or pithy anec-
dotes. It was a speech of ideas and plans.

“While the University today is shaking off

its 19th-century aloofness, the institution remains
essentially conservative in its forms, and this is in
keeping with its mission of preservation of
knowledge. Individual professors often express
individually radical or socially critical points of
view  Yet they are committed to conservative

nos or Wlsnom?

After laying out his beliefs about what the
University is, he submits a plan for the next major
step of the University. ‘

He outlined the need for Pitt to add to its

strengths by ﬁnding more public and private
ﬁnancial support, and making use of the the high-
quality faculty, students, and constituencies,
including the city of Pittsburgh.

Throughout his speech, Posvar emphasized
the primary mission of universities —- educating

challenge will be remaining an
educator while facing pressures
to become a corporate CEO.

 

A Wesley Posvar (1967-1990) set

forth a clear vision for the ‘

University that was predicated on
respect for the undergraduates.

students — and at the same time, he had a
tremendous amount of respect for those same
students.

“The prestige and financial rewards of
research contracts must not overshadow the edu-
cational needs of students  in developing the
University community, we must pay attention to
the students themselves. I believe that the so-
called generation gap is. not a maturity gap.
Young people perceive that they have a greater
stake in the future than their elders  while stu—
dents lack experience, they know more than any-
one about their own wants and needs  The

curriculum and the competent teacher and the

environment conducive to education. We intend
therefore to listen carefully to what our students
have to say.”

This respect for the students carried over
into Posvar’s administrative tenure. For example,
when the city police used mace on a crowd of
students and viciously beat one during a protest
which blocked traffic, Posvar publicly defended
the students in his statements after the event.

Posvar’.s tenure ended with a cloud sur-
rounding a retirement package voted to him by
the Board of Trustees. Regardless, throughout his
temi. Posvar tried to make the principles and
ideas embodied in his speech practical facts.

After Posvar left, Pitt was invited to go on a
joumey with the next head, who was now named
“chancellor.” J. Dennis O’Connor came in telling
stories about monks, candles, and joining hands.

He read prose poems and deliberately
avoided talking about the purpose of a universi-

ty.

ROM PAGE 4 5

 

‘Typically, on occasions such as today’s,
you hear a lot about a university’s missions,
goals, and strategic plans.

‘That is not my intent today. I wish to talk
instead about a context of values for all we do,
values that surround and permeate our missions,

our goals, our strategic plans. We will speak of

ends,ibut first let us clarify our means.”
O’Connor then went on to talk about self-
lessness, the ability to change while staying true
to traditions, and honesty. He also read poems,
talked about “fascinating” books he had read,
and tried to envision students in the mid-21 st cen-
tury. He asked the audience to tell him what his

. values should be.

The journey O’Connor took Pitt on began
with over $300,000 in renovations to the
Chancellor’s oﬁice and residence. He put on a
lavish installation ceremony, which some Pitt
administrators referred to as “The Coronation,”
and a $27,000 private dinner. His reign collapsed
over a dispute with the Board of Trustees over
medical insurance plans.

This brings us to the present.

Chancellor Nordenberg held out the ‘hope
that his remarks would be short during his induc-
tion. He said that Pitt included his investiture in
the Honors convocation for two reasons, the ﬁrst
being his personal preference to mark the leader-
ship change in an achievement recognition cere-
mony.

“The second was Chairman Connolly’s
belief that if my ‘acceptance speech’ was sched-
uled near the end of an already-full program, my

remarks would have to be of a somewhat man-
ageable length.”

The hopes for “manageable length” were
dashed as the chancellor continued through the
other 10 pages of the speech.

Nordenberg spoke of the history of the
University of Pittsburgh. He said that the
University has conferred 180,000 degrees, of
which more than 40 percent were graduate
degrees. There was no mention of the possibility
that some graduate programs may disappear in
the current FAS budget crisis.

Yet the one missing piece of the puzzle was
a mention of primacy for undergraduate educa-
tion. Nordenberg took a quote from a recent
Pitts‘/aurg/1 Magazine article that listed his
responsibilities.

They were: attract new students, keep cur-
rent students, renovate buildings, attract more
state funding, attract more federal grants, hire a
chief fund-raiser, hire an athletic director, hire a
vice-chancellor for health sciences, promote
research, improve efficiency, make friends, inﬂu-
ence people, pursue excellence, generate jobs,
and invigorate the regional economy.

There were more comparisons between
being a chancellor and being a corporate CEO.
Among these comparisons was one point of trust.

“And I use the term trust quite deliberately,
because the obligations to which I refer have less
to do with the narrow notions of consumerism
than they do with the old-fashion ideals of teach-
ing as a profession.” p

Despite the talk of the wonders of research,
the corporate mentality, and reinvigorating the
region’s economy, we must hope that
Nordenberg stays true to the message in the mid-
dle of his speech.

The ceremony began with him receiving a
distinguished teaching award. Nordenberg said
that teaching is his ﬁrst profession.

“I still consider myself ﬁrst and foremost to
be a teacher. And one of my favorite quotes about
that aspect of my life’s work comes from Hemy
Adams, who once said: ‘A teacher affects eterni-
ty; he can never tell where his inﬂuence stops.’
That inspiring description of potentially lirrritless
impact really could be applied more broadly to
virtually every dimension of our University
we .”

The trick for the coming years will be for
Nordenberg to remember that fundraising does
not have the limitless impact of teaching. Pitt
needs a teacher who can tell the CEOs who sit as
trustees the true mission of the University.
Making ketchup is not the same as training
minds.

But Bowman wasn’t always
as outspoken as he is now.

As a child, he says he was
terribly shy, and often kept to
himself. It wasn’t until junior
high school that he began to feel
more conﬁdent.

“It also helped that girls

were ever more present in my‘

life,” he said laughingly.
In high school, he began to
reach out further. He joined the

band as a trombone player and ‘

entered a pre-engineering pro-
gram offered by his high school,
Paul Lawrence Dunbar, the ﬁrst
high school founded solely to
educate African  He
also joined the senior class

responsibility was to oversee all
the activities plarmed for that
year.

choose a college, Bowman elect-

“The decision was based on
ﬁnancial reasons and the fact that
Pitt was away from home for me,
but not too far away,” he said.

before his freshman year at Pitt.
In July of that year, Bowman’s
father passed away.

“Though my parents had
been separated, my father had
been ever—present in my life,” he
said. “Losing my dad was one of
the hardest things that I have had
to deal with.”

When Bowman arrived at
Pitt that fall, he said he experi-
enced a “big culture shock.”
Though his transition from high
school to college was made easi-
er by three close friends from
home who had also chosen to
attend Pitt, there were several
new experiences for all of them.

“I hate going downtown,”
Bowman said, laughing. “I hate
downtown Pittsburgh. I hate the
tall buildings that are all
crammed together. In downtown

_ D.C., the buildings are short and

spaced out.” »
Bowman started his college
career as a premed-biology
major, but then switched to
premed—chemist1y. By the sec-
ond semester of his junior year,
however, he was having doubts.

other reasons. And that’s when I
started wondering if I would be
happy.”

Bowman was taking an eco-
nornics class as an elective, and
the teacher asked him if he had a
major. When Bowman told her
that he had, she said that he had a
strong understanding of econom-
rcs.

“A lot of personal things
came to the forefront second
semester junior year,” he said. “I
thought about transferring near
home, and I don’t think that I had
focus. When my professor
helped me change my mind
about my major, that’s when
things started to come together.”

As the conversation turned
to the topic of what he was cur-
rently working on in his ofﬁce,
Bowman’s face lit up, and he
excitedly A began to tell of his
plans.

One of Bowman’s main
concerns as a board member is to
increase the SGB’s communica-
tion with students and students’
knowledge of the SGB. As a
result, he\has been working on
several ways to make this possi-
ble.

Bowman created the town
hall meetings, which are an open
forum for students to come and
speak to the board members and
other University department ofﬁ-
cials about their problems and

|.Sﬂ!Ill'thmIk(l’l.SAC.

concerns.

Bowman also made a com-
mitment to work on social pro-
gramming for students. So far, he
has organized mall shuttles,
which operate every Saturday
and alternate between the Ross
Park and Century HI Malls.

“Students had come to me
and said that the programs
offered at Pitt were not what they
had expected them to-be,” he
said, “so I promised during my
campaign that I would try to find
alternate programming.”

Bowman said his objective
for the end of the semester is to
tackle the credit—card issue on
this campus. He wants to
decrease the presence of the
credit—card personnel who stand
in the student union and try to
recruit customers.

“I also want to give seminars
to teach the students of the haz-
ards of credit cards and credit-
card usage,” he said.

Bowman also said he wants
students to know that the SGB is
student-friendly, and that he
wants to talk to as many students
as possible.

“My advice is to come up
and ask if you have a question or
a complaint. Go to a meeting, or
stop up at the oﬂice,” he said.
“The Student Government
Board oﬁce is always open, and
the members are always open.”

Republicans use thesame tricks as Clinton to get campaign cash

 

«:
a

Unless you’ve been living under a rock
or don’t have any clue about what goes on in
the world, you must be familiar with the latest
round of yelling and screaming coming out of
Washington over alleged irnproprieties in the
Clinton administrations frmdraising efforts in
the 1996 election. For those who don’t know
orarealittleconfusedaboutwhatallofthe
fuss is about, Republicans essentially are
alleging that the Clinton White House broke
federal laws by raising money in the White
House, and by using perks like overnight
stays in the Lincoln Bedroom as an incentive
for people to give money. Now, it appears that
the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,
chaired by Senator Fred Thompson of
Tennessee, will hold hearings soon into
whether or not any laws were broken.

So, do I think that the Republicans have
a legitimate complaint about the Clinton
administration’s ftmdraising? Sure, but in
their rush to bash President Clinton, the
Republicans have ignored some inconvenient
issues about themselves that I think ought to
be addressed.

For starters, the Republicans are no
angels themselves when it comes to raising

money. The two major parties spent a stag-
gering $881 million on the 1996 election, and
the Republicans spent 62 percent of that
money. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
recently told a gathering of big contributors
that $100,000 contributions to politicians is
“the American way.”

How did the Republicans gain such an
edge in ﬁmdraising? Simple —-— when the
Republicans took control of Congress in
1994, they openedthedoortocorporatespe-
cial interests like no party has ever done
before. Newt Gingrich told contributors prior
to the 1994 election, “For anybody who’s not
on board now, it’s going to be a cold two years
in Washington.” The Republicans actually
allowed timber, mining, and ranching groups
to write legislation so that the companies they
represent could beneﬁt One lobbyist cava-
lierly remarked, “I’m not claiming to be a
Boy Scout. No question, I thought I was
doing what was in the best interests of my
clients.” Guys like these have complaints
about the way the Clinton administration rais-
es money?

Some members of Congress recognize
that both parties have dirty laundry and have
boldly proposed changes to the way money is
raised. Senators John McCain and Russell
Feingold have introduced a bill before the

Senate which bans soft money (money which
is unregulated by campaign ﬁnance laws) and
caps contributions which can be made to
political action committees. Trent Lott and
most of the Republican Senate caucus oppose
the McCain—Feingold bill and have worked
very hard to kill it 'I‘he Republicans have also
fought tenaciously against suggestions by
Democrats to widen Senator Thompson’s
probe into carnpaigrr-ﬁnance violations of the
last election to/ include the Republican
Congress. Senator McCain, a Republican,
observed sorrowfully, “They don’t want
Thompson to look into the congressional
stuti It’s one of the most cynical things I’ve
ever seen.”

So, do you wonder why the Republicans
are going after Clinton so ferociously when
they should be taking a long hard look at
themselves? Prior to 1992, the Republicans
could claim that the judgement of history was
on their side. After all, in the previous_six pres-
idential elections, the GOP candidate had
won ﬁve times and the Republicans tended to
write oﬂ° Jimmy Carter’s defeat of Gerald
Ford in 1976 as a ﬂuke. Then Bill Clinton
came along, but the Republicans still hoped to
writehimoﬂ°asanaberra1ionafterthe
Democrats got creamed in the 1994 election.
Wltll Clinton’s victory and the GOP’s lethar-

gic response to Bob Dole’s defeat, the
Republicans can no longer claim that they are
history’s victors. Since Nixon resigned fol-
lowing the Watergate scandal, the
Republicans and Democrats have split the last
six presidential elections. As columnist
Michael Kinsley noted after the last election,
“Now we’re even.” Unfortunately, the
Republicans just can’t seem to let it go. Prior
to the election, they whined about how
Clinton was  ” their ideas. Now,
they’ve decided to make the claim that
Clinton stole the election.

The fact is that endless hearings into this
mess won’t accomplish a darn thing other
than to poison the chance for the govemment
to get moving on problems like reforming
entitlement programs. I was disgusted to read
in Newsweek over spring break that Senator
Thompson and Democratic Senator John
Glenn actually had to hold a meeting in order
to see who would have access to the
Governmental Affairs Comn1ittee’s photo-
copying machine. That level of mistrust is
only going to get worse if the Republicans
continue to engage in their witch-hunt rather
than accept the facts. As I said earlier this year
to the Republicans: You lost. Get over it.
Michael Berquist thinks that all of these inves-
tigations are a complete waste of time.

Daddy Dearest:
The Kevin
Willard Story

 

I remember back in Little League when
my coach would publicly scold his two sons
for botching a ground ball or striking out
when the game was on the line.

That same dad was also active in coach-
ing our basketball teams, and a missed free
throw or a turnover would always end up
with the exact same reaction.

Ever since those tender years of adoles-
cence I have been a staunch believer that
parents should not be allowed past the
bleachers.

Angry parents rant and rave about their
child’s playing time or why little Jimmy did-
n’t get to take the penalty kick enough as it
is, they certainly shouldn’t be the ones who
make the decisions.

There have been great stories of fathers
and sons taking the family out of the team.
The nastiest of all coaches, the general
Bobby Knight, was brought to tears a few
years back when he introduced his son on
senior night in Bloomington.

Tubby Smith had climbed on his son
G.G.’s shoulders this year as Georgia has
played their way to a number three seed in
the NCAA Tournament.

All of these stories are ﬁne and dandy,
but they still won’t heal the mental scars that
remain from the sideline whoopings I saw
some kids get from their mas and pas back
in the good old days.

[Speaking of mental scars, that brings
me to my main point. A point that I bring up
but I can safely say that I am not the only
witness to this awful version of a father and
son duo in sports.]

Earlier in the season, many Pitt faithfuls
questioned the use of Panther guard Kevin
Willard. He paciﬁed the sceptics with peri-
odic stints of decent play, and in the City
Game against Duquesne he even went off
for 11 points inonehalf.

To my surprise, Willard does lead the
team in assist—tumover ratio, but I would

Pitt punishes Privateers, 82-63

  

For the University of
New Orleans hoops squad,
the trip from the Big Easy to
the Big East wasn’t easy.

The Sun Belt

’ Conference—bred Privateers

got their first and last taste
of East Coast basketball
Wednesday, after being
thrashed 82-63 in the first
round of the NIT by the Pitt
Panthers. '

. “Normally, we’re the
intimidating team,” said
Privateer Head Coach Tic
Price. “Tonight, it was a dif-
ferent league for us.”

Pitt intimidated the
intirnidators with a 21-3 run
to open the contest.
Vonteego Cummings regis-
tered eight of Pitt’s early
points, including a 3-pointer
and a three-point play that
highlighted the Panther per-
forrnance.

“He plays with no fear,”
said Pitt Head Coach Ralph
Willard of his point guard.
“He’s worked extremely

ish with 25 on the night to
lead all Pitt scorers. New
Orleans swingman Kwan
Johnson led all scorers with
26, and shut down three-

point phenom Jason Maile _

for the evening.

Mai1e’s absence wasn’t
felt by the Panthers, who
pushed the lead as high as
20 near the end of the first
half. Most of Pitt’s points
late in the period came from
frontcourt starters Chad
Varga and Mark Blount, as
well as backup Gerald
Jordan, who would finish
with 17.

answer Pitt’s towering trio
— New Orleans center

Gymnastics records fall in spring breakout

Records are made to be broken,
but until the Pitt women’s gymnastics
team was finished tumbling over
spring break, they didn’t know what
that meant. *

Pitt went into the Pennsylvania
Collegiate Classic on Feb. 28 with a 3-
7 overall record, and after drubbing
Ball State on Mar. 8, are now 9-8.

At the Pennsylvania Collegiate
Classic at Penn State, the ladies were
pitted against Penn State, Temple,
Indiana of Pennsylvania, Ursinus,
West Chester, and Wilson College.
With a score of 189.6, they were able
to defeat every team except for Penn
State, who scored a 195.225. This
meet alone carried the lady tumblers
to an even 8-8 record.

With 19.375 points in two events
at State College, Robyn Senior
became the all—time leader in points
for a Pitt gymnast. Senior now has
1.439.975 points for her career here at
Pitt, passing Kristin Brown, who was

 

a Pitt gymnast from 1989 to 1993.

Pitt had two gymnasts place in the
top three in two different events. Erika
Flamer got third place on the vault
with a score of 9.7. Danielle “Freddy”
Alba scored a third-place finish on the
balance beam with a 9.875, and broke
the first of five Pitt records to fall or
be matched in the past week.

On » Saturday night, the Lady
Cardinals from Ball State University
invaded the fieldhouse and were sub-
sequently sent home with a 193.55 to
190.825 loss. The 193.55 points
scored by Pitt were the last of four Pitt
records to be tied or to fall that day.

Robyn Senior started the record-
setting day off with a 9.8 on the vault,
which tied her own record set two
years ago. Senior finished second in
the event, ahead of Lisa Fronhofe,
who was just a quarter point behind
with a 9.775. Pitt had four gymnasts in
the top five on the vault to compile a
score of 48.45, breaking the old Pitt
record of 48.35 set earlier this year.

On the uneven bars, Pitt secured
the top two spots to set another team

record for the apparatus. Samantha
Salyers captured first place with an
inspired 9.825 followed closely by

‘Janet Highhill, who earned a 9.8. Both 1

women contributed to a 48.55 team
score, which pulverized the old record
of 48.0 set earlier this year.

Kristin Bond and Amanda
Salacinski led the Panther charge on
the balance beam with identical 9.75
scores to win the event. Pitt again had
four gymnasts in the top five spots,
and each of the four scored a 9.7 or
higher. Pitt completed their rotation
on the beam with a score of 48.0
points.

Senior came within a quarter point
of tying another Pitt record when she.
captured first place with a 9.85 on the
floor exercise. Alba captured third
place on the ﬂoor with a 9.775 to con-
tribute to a team score of 48.55.

Alba finished second with a
38.525, as she was the only Pitt gym-
nast to compete in the all-around.

Pitt finishes up their regular sea-
son with a meet this Saturday, Mar.
15, at Ball State. 1

Lady Panthers add in-state stars

The Pitt women’s soccer team is
starting to come together nicely, and the
addition of two Pennsylvania stars is the
latest addition to Roland Sturk’s up and
coming program.

Nicole Bashor, a goalkeeper from
Harrisburg, was a four—time varsity letter
winner at Central Dauphin East High
School and was a Mid—Penn League all-
star.

Bashor was named to the Harrisburg

.,Patri0t-News Big 11 team twice.

“We’re very pleased to have both of
these players join the women’s soccer

about Nicole because she’s in the state’s

Pill‘ home opener shuffled

30 at home against the Ragin’ Cajuns
of Southwestern Louisiana. The

Cajuns opened their season last year '

against eventual national champion
Florida and also faced Big East
power Virginia Tech, so they are
used to playing top programs. J

Last year the Cajuns went 5-6,
including a .301 mark against
Division 1-A independent schools.
They finished the year ranked 14th in
passing offense (279.6 yards per
game) and 32nd in total offense
(404.3 yards per game).

The problem occurred when the
Cougars of -Washington State
informed officials at the Big East that
they would not travel to Syracuse for
an Aug. 30 opener. This forced the
Orangemen to revert to their original
agreement with N.C. State.

“The important issue in this mat-
ter, not only for our fans, but for our
team and new Head Coach Walt
Harris, is that we are able to begin a
new year in Pitt football in our stadi-
um and in front of our fans,” Athletic
Director Steve Pederson said. “The
circumstances surrounding this
change are unfortunate and not only
affect our schedule but Syracuse’s
and N.C. State’s. We are very fortu-
nate, however, at this late date to add
a quality opponent, who has always
played a very competitive schedule,
as our home opener.”

Heck, I play basketball at Trees all the ‘
time and I see players hustle just as much as
Willard does. The difference between these
players and unlucky number 13 is that many
of these guys could hit the broad side of a
bani with at least half of their jumpers.

When Kellii Taylor fouled out last week
against Boston College Willard was forced
to play most of the stretch run, during which
the Panthers ran out of gas and fell to the
eventual Big east Champions.

VVith around eight minutes to play,
Vonteego Cummings hit two amazing shots
and the Cancun Sports World around me
rocked with the cheers of Pitt fans. After a
timeout by BC, the entire Madison Square
Garden, Sports World, and probably even
theEaglesﬁguredtheballwouldbein
Vonteego’s hands, thus giving the super soph
PitI’s fate entirely.

No, that would have made too much
sense.

crossover followed by a spin to ‘elude
Tournament MVP Scoonie Penn. Rather
than ﬁnding a wide open Isaac Hawkins
under the hoop, Willard found a guy selling
Cokes three rows behind the baseline.

I hope Keith got that turnover for his stat
sheet.

At this point in the game, the Panthers
needed points and solid defense, not just
intangibles that “don’t always show up on
the stat sheet.” They needed the ball in the
hands of the man that got them there, not the
guy who tried to match Jason Mai1e’s range
with dangerously-off jumpers and confus-
ing, errant passes.

The boos showered from the Pitt section
as the squeaky clean, “rah, rah, rah” Boston
College crowd basked in their victory. As the

 

Pitt contingent walked out with heads low,
the crew from Massachusetts had some

choice words, the most polite of which‘

referred to “daddy’s boy.”

There is a big difference between
Division 1 basketball players and those who
don’t quite make the cut for the elite level of
intercollegiate play.

Kevin Willard wasn’t recruited by any

Division 1 schools out of high school, but
thanks to his good old dad Ralph’s position

at Western Kentucky, he found his way onto

the Hilltoppers roster.

It was to no one’s surprise when Willard
left the blue grass for the Big East and Kevin
came along.

The questions is: is it fair for players to

be slighted out of playing time and a possi-

ble scholarship just to have two Willards on
the ﬂoor?

I really don’t think so.

Ralph Willard is an employee of the
University, therefore his son doesn’t need a
scholarship. A scholarship that could easily
be awarded to a more deserving player.

There are players who are going to hus-
tle and work hard in practice, but so would I
if given a free ride and control of the game
with only minutes to play. Problem is, I
couldn’t handle the pressure and I don’t
belong playing against the likes of Scoonie
Penn and Shaheen Holloway.

Neither does Kevin Willard.

Washington committed his fifth foul,
mugging Jordan on a layup attempt.
Jordan made both free throws, starting a
6-0 Panther run and putting the game
out of reach at 65-40.

Helping the Panther’s offensive
onslaught was the defense of guard
Kellii Taylor, who tied a team record
with seven steals on the night. He added

seven assists, seven boards and eight

points to his thefts, as well as one slam
dunk three minutes into the second half
that brought the crowd to their feet.

“He really got after it defensively,”
said Willard of the Pitt freshman. “He
can really change a game defensively

“Rudy, Rudy, Rudy,” Panther standout
Chris Gardella entered the contest. Point
guard Kevin Willard fed Gardella the
ball, but a last—second attempt by the
Privateers to foul the 5-7 guard missed

minutes of play this season.

The Panthers move on to play the
Arkansas Razorbacks in the NIT’s sec-
ond round, with site and date yet to be
determined. No ruling will be made by
the NIT until tomorrow, but Pitt officials
expect the game to be held at Arkansas,
which boasts a larger home attendance
average than the Panthers.

Lynch’s Highway leads
nowhere, unfortunately

Lost Highway

Directed by David Lynch

With Patricia Arquette, Bill Pullman,
Balthazar Getty, Robert Blake, and
Richard Pryor

I‘m sure I’m not the only person who’s
been anxiously awaiting the release of
David Lynch’s ﬁrst feature ﬁlm since
l992’s Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me. I’m
also pretty sure that I’m not the only one of
those people who feels cheated by Lost
Highway.

Lynch established his reputation as a
unique, highly individualistic, even freakish,
ﬁlmmaker with his 1972 feature debut
Eraserhead.. The strength of this cult classic
allowed him the opportunity to direct The
Elephant Man, which was more main-
stream in that it was aimed at larger- audi-
ences and was “based on a true story.” Since
then, Lynch has alternately been lionized
and cruciﬁed by critics, often from one ﬁlm
to the next. His interpretation of Frank
Herbert's novel “Dune” is generally consid-
ered to be the only total failure of his career,
although it seems every critic has his or her
own personal least—favorite Lynch ﬁlm. Fire
Walk Vﬁtlz Me was, in my opinion, one of
the ﬁnest mainstream ﬁlms of our time, and
it was panned across the board by critics
who probably spend too much time watch-

ing TV. Lost Highway has received much
the same reaction from those who try to say
that Lynch hasn’t made a decent ﬁlm since
Blue Velvet. For once, I can almost agree
with these people.

Lost Highway features two separate
story lines co—written by Lynch and “Wild at
Heart” author Barry Gifford. These stories
intersect  sort of. Patricia Arquette is a ﬁne
actress who takes on dual roles as the female
lead in both stories. Bill Pullman is an
unconvincing bore who resembles Kyle
MacLachlan and the real—life David Lynch a
little too much. It’s perfectly ﬁne with me if
Lynch wants to project his own fantasies
and nightmares onto the screen, but it does-
n’t necessarily work when he tries to mix
these up with some wannabe noir tech-
niques in such a high-proﬁle ﬁlm as this.

The press release describes this ﬁlm as
a “mesmerizing meditation on the mysteri-
ous nature of identity” that “expands the
nature of the medium.” I would say that this
is an apt description of Eraserhead, but Lost
Highway is more like an empty, masturba-
tory gesture with some ﬁne moments and
some interesting plot devices that altogether
smells a bit too much like a patchwork of
scenes from Lynch’s previous ﬁlms. I really
feel terrible saying this because I’ve always
been a big fan of his work, and like any fan,
I found a whole lot to like about this ﬁlm,

Paicia Arquette takes on two roles in David Lynch’s Lost Highway.

including his constant use of self—referential
material. But, in the end, I was disappointed.
Lost Highway ultirrrately leaves the viewer
with no real feeling that he went anywhere.
And perhaps this is the point. It is, after all,
a POSTMODERNIST work, and therefore
by nature should be devoid of emotional
content. The only thing is, it’s pretty much
devoid of intellectual content as well, which
is a real bummer. .

I don’t mean to sound as though I did-
n’t enjoy watching this ﬁlm; a Lynch ﬁlm,
by deﬁnition, is never boring. There are
some great cameos (in some ways every
performance is a cameo in Lynch’s dream).
It was cool seeing Richard Pryor in a ﬁlm
again, although it was sort of sad at the same
time. Robert Loggia plays Mr. Eddy, a man
not to be fucked with. The ultimate badass

role goes to the ultimate badass himself, Mr.
Robert Blake, playing a mysterious narne—
less man. His character is, in a way, the
ﬁhn’s central plot-moving device. Only in
this movie, the plot movement is enough to
cause vertigo.

Nonlinear mainstream frlrn making is
an oxymoron, and with this ﬁlm Lynch pret-
ty much makes that obvious. He seems to
want to have his cake and eat it too, and this
just can’t be done. Lost Highway is deﬁnite-
ly worth seeing, as are all of his ﬁlms. You
may even enjoy it. I just hope that next time
around David Lynch decides what type of
movie he wants to make — an idiosyncrat-
ic little treat for the masses, or a truly exper-
imental art ﬁlm — because in the end Lost
Highway fails to be either one.

Get hip to Liverball this Friday at the 31st Street Pub

It’s 9:00 on a Monday night, and the
small room resonates with a distinctive dri-
ving sound. The buzz is pounding, causing
ears to ring.

A band is playing in a building on
Smallman Street in the Strip and you can
hear it all the way outside. Simply put —— the
band rocks.

The band is Liverball, but they aren’t
playing a show, they’re just getting ready for
one. It’s hard to imagine how much energy
they put into their shows, when the practice
sounds more intense than most others’ per-
forrnances.

On Friday, March 14, at the 3 1 st Street
Pub, everyone will get to ﬁnd out as
Liverball takes the stage once more. This
time, they are out to support their new
release, Liar, on Get Hip Records.

The record marks a new label for the
band, who previously released two seven-
inches for Ripe Records. The band put out

Kolcun refers to their history as “a very up

bassist Keith Zang.

All the members have a wide range of

Even though Liverball is a Pittsburgh
band, this eclectic mix of styles hasn’t quite
translated well in this town. However, the
band has received some airplay in other
parts of the nation as well as places outside
the country.

“It is easy to get discouraged when you
don’t get a lot of people to your local
shows,” says Snyder. “But when we ﬁnd out
that people in Europe and Japan are buying
our records and writing us to tell us that they
love it, that feels great.”

There are several reasons why the band
doesn’t get as much recognition in
Pittsburgh, says Kolcun. I

“Sometimes we could promote our
shows a lot better — laziness factor, I
guess,” he says. ‘To me anyway, it feels like
we haven’t gotten the respect we deserve,
but that may be partially our fault.
Sometimes you know that ﬁve people will
show up for a gig so you kind of say, ‘Fuck
it.’ We need to change that attitude if we
want any kind of success in this town.”

This includes the lack of support by Pitt
students, even though two of the members
are affiliated with the University. Zang is a
systems analyst for CIS and a computer—lab

my friends and I listened to what would

their second major label release, and these
days Jennifer and Neil appear anonymously
in Calvin Klein ads. Everyone ﬁgured they’d
be dropped after the lackluster sales of their
Virgin debut. Thank You, but they’ve man-
aged to hang in there, on the fringes of the
inajor-label ghetto. Those former Trux fans
who gave up on them after the tight, unchar~
acteristic and oveitly—iockin’ Wiairk You will
probably not be pleased with Sweet Si'xtem1.
This album proceeds in the same over-
the-top ‘70s rock vein as the last one. The
band (Dan Bmwri on bass and new drummer
Ken Nasta) is now more limiiliar playing as
a band, and the conipositions are now on par
with symphonic arrangements, much like
Led Zeppelin. The band sounds like what
Guns ‘n Roses (minus Axl) would be like if

THE pm NEWS ‘ I 1

Hardcore music is
alive & well in the 90's

Thrashing around to politically bent
lyrics on top of deafening guitar riffs, hard-
core bands are breaking through the conserv-
ative baniers again in Pittsburgh to satisfy a
young community tired of being told what to
do. Snapcase, Turmoil, and Still Water will
play Laga this Saturday. This is the third
show in the One Tribe Productions series of

hardcore perfor
mances. ;
Hardcore has i

long been a product of towns like Allentown,
Erie, and Lancaster, along with large cities
like Philadelphia, New York and Washington
D.C. Pittsburgh has been left out of the bulk
of hardcore in recent years since the Sonic
Temple closed in the early ‘90s. Like many
cities across the world, Pittsburgh is a radio-
run town with ﬂulf stations like "The X” and
B-94 leading the way for big-label names
who have the money. Does this mean that
this commercial altemapop is all that’s out
there?

Snapcase vocalist Daryl Tabreski is evi-
dence that this is not so. When talking to
Tabreski about this plague of radio—ﬁiendly
bands, he was quick to add that he wants to
provoke individuals to be challenged by lis-
tening to his controversial lyrics. “Hardcore
is amazing. The scene is incredibly strong,
but not common

 

through things parents don’t understand,”
says Tabreski. “Everyone is telling them
what they should be. Hardcore should be a
community [in] that people realize they have
to work together and respect opinions.”
Tabreski realizes that he is in a position of
inﬂuence in dealing with underage kids and
feels that the show experience is a place to
exchange new ideas.
Someone is lis-
tening to these bands
because a whole underground world of labels
and contacts has developed to support the
growing scene. What is most astonishing is
that the United States is not the only country
generating this underground movement.
Snapcase, like many other bands, has toured
Europe, satisfying ' the scene overseas.
However, hardcore is still dominated by the

product of rebellious young American subur-

banites in their ﬁght against mediocrity.

Turmoil, who is also appearing with
Snapcase on Saturday, has also toured
Europe. They are venturing across the
Atlantic once again this spring with Earth
Crisis. Vocalist Jon Gula is very cordial in
conversation, although you wouldn’t know it
if you saw him on stage jumping around in
ﬁts of rage.

“We challenge ourselves to write about
issues that other

or radio—friendly, bands don’t think
so it’s limited on ; about,” says
how big it can  Gula.”We have a lot

ideals of punk. Gula
Unlike traditional When aSk6d
punk, “hardcore is why hardcore isn’t

less chaotic and
more aggressive,”
according to
Tabreski.

There has been a
lot of bad press in the hardcore scene because
of the violent reputation which has followed
punks. “Hardcore doesn’t work when people
are insulted, which is a common problem,”
says Tabreski.

The swirling mosh pits that are formed
at their shows is how the positive aggression
is expressed in captivating live performances.
Tabreski echoes the sentiments of Sick of It
All’s drummer when he says, “Hardcore
mosh pits are a positive release of negative
energy and daily frustrations.”

The audience that participates in this
venting is, on average, between the ages of
13 and the early 20s. “Younger kids go

mainstream, Gula
suggested that
“bands that have
radio play don’t real-
ize how big a follow-
ing we have.” And so exists the independent
world of hardcore. Gula is in his early 20s
and says the music makes him feel young.
“\Vrthout it I’d be bored.”

Progression Through Learning is
Snapcase is new CD (due to be released April
8.) Their US. tour takes place in June and
July, and moves to Europe in August.
Tumroilis From Bleeding Hands CD is on
Victory Records. Along with their European

 

dates, they ’re touring in South America this‘

summer. But before the chaos spreads
around the world, they ’ll be at Laga Mar 15

for an all-ages show.

dent in the anthropology department.

“lt’s tough to get Pitt students to come
out, because there’s no place in Oakland to
play anymore,” says Grimes. “A lot of them
aren’t of age, and we don’t play all—ages
shows that often. There’s deﬁnitely so many

- people that are interested in all sorts of

music, there’s no reason why we shouldn’t
get a bigger tumout from the local Pitt stu-

V dents.”

The bandalso notes that they would
like to do more shows through the
University and student-activity programs.

' “There used to be more shows at David
Lawrence and Benedum, which they don’t
have anymore,” says Triglia. “But WPTS
has been pretty good to us with our previous
two records. We got a lot of good airplay
and good response from that.”

While bigger audiences and wider air-

. play would be nice, financial success is not

the primary motivation for Liverball. The
group points out that their main priority is to
have fun.

Liverball formed when Grimes and
Triglia met former guitarist Buck Knauer at

form a band with Kolcun and another
friend.

“He had an idea for the band, a name

acter. I think it read ‘More Liver for Your

The band is currently past the magic-
marker T—sl1irt days, and is attempting to
promote its latest record. “Liar” is a song
that causes much debate among the band.

“Actually, we didn’t choose it for the
record. The guy at Get Hip chose it for what

reasons, I really don’t know,” says Kolcun.
“I think there could have been a better
choice.”

“I liked the choice,” Zang chimes in.

“But it’s actually not a true interpreta-
tion of the band and how the band sounds,”
replies Kolcun. “So if you really want to
hear how the band sounds, come hear us
live or buy our other two records, because
that’s how the band really does soun .”

“I think the way the song is now and the
way we will play it at the 31st Street Pub is
l0O—percent Liverball,” Zang answers.

The debate rages on, but eventually the
band seems to come to a consensus that the
song is, in fact, a good one. Still, Kolcun
doesn’t seem to be too sure of the matter.

However, the band is sure that they will
put on a good show.

“We pack an hour of entertainment into
a 35-minute package,” says Zang.

Liverball will be performing with fellow
Get Hip recording artists Pilsner on F nday,
March 14, at the 31 st Street Pub. The over-
2I show starts promptly at 9:30 p.m.

Sound

they had brains and good taste. (See Jesse
Trbovich’s Spring] 995 Vox review of
Thank You for an accurate description of
the Trux sound.) Royal Trux are a nonlin-
ear map of the history of rock ‘n roll, with
extra emphasis on the debauched and the
poetic.

The first track, “Don’t Try Too Hard”
actually made me laugh for a second, due
to the tossed—in ELOesque keyboard part,
but by the time the chorus rolled along, I
was sold. “Morphic Resident” continues in
the vein of Thank You’s “Ray 0 Vac”, with
its dare—you—ta—sing—along refrain. On the
third track, “The Pickup”, Hagerty is at his
soulful best, taking on the vocal duties for
the chorus, in yet another tale of a deal
gone bad. Images of stuff being dropped
off bridges onto the tarps on the tops of fruit
trucks, the b11rnt—out road and cash stashed
behind hotel beds abound. As always, the
vocal trade-offs between man and woman
work superbly, especially considering the
fact that Herrema sings the masculine
parts, and Hagerty. strains to hit the high
notes.

They incorporate samples on this

 

record (silly crowd cheering appears and
disappears, along with a looped Lenny
Bruce quote), but don’t delve into hip hop,
which they’ve screwed around with in the
past. I kind of wish they would have.

“Roswell Seeds and Stems” is a
Southern Rock epic, in which a character
named Russell who runs a hydroponic
farm knocks off Linda Rollo, who took off
with his harvest. It’s lyrical stories like this
that have mystified Trux fans since their
self-titled debut, along with the cryptic
cover art, including badass photos of the
photogenic duo. This CD is unavailable on
Drag City vinyl (apparently because they
lost too much money releasing Thank You
on vinyl, despite the widespread Virgin
release), which is a first for the group.
Another ﬁrst is the inclusion of a lyrics
sheet, which inevitably happens when you
sucker someone like Virgin into picking up
a great band that will never produce a hit
single, which is ironic, because the 
hooks and solid grooves have never been
so accessible as on this one. The lyrics,
thank God, are as dense as ever.

Every song on Sweet Sixteen is a win-
ner, and the disc has been replaying itself in
my head since I bought it. My only com-

THE PITT NEWS

p1aint—— and it is a sentiment that has been
echoed by every Trux fan who I know
(most of my friends) — is that I wish they
would chill out a little. On records like
Back To School, they proved that they can
kick it on a more mellow, mysterious, and
psychedelic tip than any other artist who
has entered the rock arena. The arena, by
the way, is a place the band might be com-
fortable playing after this one.

So what does the future hold for Royal
Trux? Will they tour as a supporting act for
some lame altemaband at outdoor venues
this surrrrner? I pray that they won’t. Their
Metropol gig two years ago was one of the
only quality shows I’ve seen in that shit-
hole. I hope they throw their audience a
few more curveballs before they call it
quits, because like David Yow said, once
you sell out, and then get dropped by a
major, no indie label will touch you. I can’t
exactly see the Trux going back to their
roots, because their roots lie in exactly the
kind of music they’re making now. They
just obscured it, chopped it up, and glued it
back together wrong in the past. They are
truly one of America’s great rock ‘n roll
bands, and I hope they don’t go broke.
