The Black Action Society has issued a
statement of 14 demands which, if met,
would make the University of Pittsburgh
recommendable to black students.

“[The points] in some part try and deal
with the social, political, cultural and
academic deficiencies lat Pittl,” Justin
Laing, BAS political-action chairperson,

said.

This action comes a week after the
BAS released a statement saying it could
no longer recommend Pitt to black
students because of academic, political,
social, cultural and faculty deficiencies.

Yesterday, Laing said that compliance
with the 14 points would not make the
BAS take back last week's statement, but
“if they were to do those things, we
believe that we'd be much closer to
being a recommendable university, so it
wouldn’t have to be that we couldn’t

The BAS has set a deadline of March 12
for the administration to respond to the
demands.

The administration needs to have
“numerical goals and timetables for
dealing with the problems," Laing said.
“We want to see what they have, what
their intentions are. If their intentions are
that this will be dealt with in 1998, then
we’ll recommend it in 1998."

“This has been planned all along, and

Posvar responds
to black concerns

By Jennifer Calabrese

Pitt President Wesley Posvar responded yesterday to
last week's statement by the Black Action Society that
it could no longer recommend Pitt for black students.

“I affirm the right of Pitt students to express their
opinions on the quality of social justice and equal
opportunity on this campus. And I welcome the
passion and commitment of your public statements,”
Posvar said in a prepared statement

‘Unfortunately, I think a more meaningful way to
improve the diversity of the university is not to encourage
minority students to stay away but to work toward
enhancing campus diversity to add to and strengthen
your voices of concern," Posvar said.

Justin Laing, chairperson of the BAS political-action
committee, said Posvar’s statement was ‘so general that
we cannot really respond to it.”

Conservative groups argue

conservative groups said last
week's teach-in on the Persian
Gulfwar was biased against U.S.
military presence in the gulf, but
peace activists said the teach-in
was designed to disclose
information withheld by the
media.

The teach-in was held because
press coverage of the war has
been overwhelmingly supportive

of the Bush administration, said
Nancy Kaiser, a member of the
Pittsburgh Committee for a
Comprehensive Peace in the
Middle East, one of the groups
which sponsored the teach-in.

“There is a need for alternative
sources of information within the
community,” said Kaiser.

But the Pitt Army ROTC
battalion commander, Cadet Lt.
Col. Carlos Henderson, disagreed.
“I think the peace people are
having enough say in the news,"

U.S. gives cool response to news of Iraqi pullout

By Jeff Tatusko

Perspective Editor

Official reaction in this country to news
ofa possible Iraqi pullout from Kuwait has
been very cool.

In a surprise move, Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein ordered his troops to
withdraw from Kuwait yesterday. But White
House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said yesterday that the United States has
not been notified of any Iraqi proposal.

 

4&3

IN THE GULF

“The war goes on,” he said.

A military official said the Iraqis are just
trying to get a break from the continuous
pounding they’ve experienced over the
past six weeks. “They want us to pause;

they want us to quit,” he said.

Similar reaction came from other
countries shortly after the announcement.
The Saudi Arabian ambassador to the
United States called the report “highly
suspicious.” The Kuwaiti ambassador said
that the world should not “get excited"
over the proposal.

The statement, made by an unnamed
Iraqi official, was broadcast over Baghdad
radio and said that the Iraqis would comply
with U.N. Security Council Resolution 660,

which calls for an unconditional withdrawal
from Kuwait. The report also stated that
the Iraqis would do this in agreement with
a recent Soviet peace proposal.

The statement does not say that the
withdrawal will begin immediately.
Although there was no official time period
for the retreat to begin, according to the
Soviet initiative, Iraq's withdrawal would
come one day after the beginning of a

cease-fire.

How to deal With a discrimination complaint

By Mark Smith
S¢a_[]‘ Writer

Discrimination is illegal. Over
the last 40 years, federal, state
and local governments have
enacted laws protecting against
discrimination in the workplace,
public accommodation, housing
and education. However, most
Americans are unaware of how
civil-rights legislation works or
how to challenge discrimination.

Equal opportunity is not always
reality for Americans. In the
summerofl989, the U.S. Supreme
Court handed down six decisions
that weakened two laws
protecting Americans from
discrimination. I)iscrirnination
complaints are not always obvious
or easily proven. Civil-rights laws
are constantly changing.
Everyone should be aware of the
basics about civil rights.

Question: What discrimination
is illegal at Pitt’

Answer: The University of
Pittsburgh, as an employer or
educational institution, does not

discriminate on the basis of race,
color, religion, ethnicity, national

origin, age, sex, sexual
orientation, marital, veteran or
handicapped status. The

university’s commitment is
overseen by the Office of
Affirmative Action. You can reach
the office at 648-7860.

Q: What discrimination is illegal
in the city of Pittsburgh?

A: The Pittsburgh Human
Relations Commission handles
discrimination complaints as
above except for marital status,
which is not protected in the
city's Human Relations Code.
Discrimination complaints in
housing, employment, public
accommodations or education
should be filed with the
commission if the victim wishes
to seek action.

Q: Can the Pittsburgh Human
Relations Commission investigate
Pill?

A: Yes. The university is subject
to federal, state and local
regulations.

[1 ow do I
discrimination complaint?

A: To file a discrimination
complaint in the city, it’s necessary
to file the complaint in person at

Q:

pursue a

the Human Relations
Commissions office in the City-
County Building. You can reach
the commission at 255-2600, if
you want to discuss the situation
before you visit the office. You
don't need an attorney to file a

complaint.

Usually, after filing a complaint,
an investigator is assigned to
handle the matter. You and the
discriminating party may take part
in a fact—finding meeting with the
commission. For example, if an
employee loses his or her job on
the basis of race or sexual
orientation, the employee may
be entitled to lost wages and
reinstatement ofthe lost position.

Q: What ifmy complaint is against
a city or state government?

A: The Equal [Employment
Opportunity Commission
enforces federal civil-rights
legislation. If the discrimination
is in violation of federal civil—
rights laws, call 644-3444. 'Ihis
federal agency has the ability to
investigate government and
public— agency discrimination, as
well as private-employer
discrimination.

Q: Does civil-rights legislation

favor minorities?

A: No. Civil-rights legislation

ROTC replies to PS1‘? demand

 

By Renee Crespy
Suﬁ’ Writer

Pittsburgh Students For Peace
are within its rights in asking Pitt
President Wesley Posvar to
eliminate the university’s ROTC
program in an effort to promote
peace, according to an Air Force
ROTC instructor.

According to Air Force Col.
John Stecklow, PSfP has a right to
submit a letter requesting that the
ROTC program be suspended on
campus.

“My reaction is basically any
group can submit a letter to Posvar
requesting something. However
this group of people basically

wants peace, but they want it in
one way. Everyone here wants
peace, and we feel we are going
about it in the right way. Both
groups want peace, but we're
just at opposite ends of the
spectrum," he said.

On Thursday, about 75 PSfP
members hand-delivered a
statement to Posvar's oﬂice that
asked for the elimination of the
ROTC or the establishment of a
peace and justice studies
department.

Posvar was not in his office and
has not since commented on
whether he will comply with
PSfP's demands.

“I feel that this is a small, vocal

group exercising its rights.
Whether the university wants to
react is up to them," said Stecklow.
“The university has the authority
to take ROTC off, however in this
instance, I don’t think the
university will take any type of
action.”

Stecklow said the ROTC
program plays an important part
in helping maintain the stability
of the U.S. military.

Stecklow said that he supports
Bush's policy in the Persian Gulf.

“President Bush has taken
action that will result in peace,
and I feel that this was the only
way to put stability back to that
part of the world.”

PSfP memberJustin Ahren said
that the group views the homeless

“With more money being put

Former rnayorial
candidate to speak

By Lane Hornfeck
Staff Writer

Students Against Racism has invited Byrd Brown, a 1989
candidate for mayor of Pittsburgh, to speak at Pitt.

ClaytonJones, the planning-committee chairperson for StAR,
said he hopes Brown will address the current racial problems
on campus.

“I hope he will talk about what the [individual] students can
do about racism as well,” said Jones.

According to Jones, Brown is very outspoken about black
issues.

“He also acquired the reputation of being level-headed and
informative during his campaign for mayor," said Jones.

Brown will speak in Room 334 of the Cathedral of Learning
tonight at 8:30.

Jones, who has been in the organization for approximately
one year, said StAR has a renewed focus. “There was a slow
period last semester and a lack of focus,” said Jones. “This
semester we have a lot of committed people.

“We decided that doing things is better than just thinking
about them. We set out at the beginning of the term and
planned out a schedule, and we are doing it," said Jones.

According toJones, “StAR is setting up a volunteer committee
to place members of the group in volunteer positions in the
community. Each position [will have] some connection to
lhelpingl the problems of racism. The positions are short
commitments, maybe two or four hours a week.”

Greeks hope to increase involvement with Greek Week charity

By Karen D. Speece
Senior Staff Writer

During this year’s Greek Week,
fraternities and sororities hope to
become more involved with their
charity than in previous years,
according to Kevin Evantos,
overall Greek Week chairperson.

“Our biggest request from last
year’s committee was to get more
involved with our charity,”
Evantos said. “Spina bifida gave
us the perfect opportunity to have
hands—on interaction with the
charity we've chosen.”

The Greeks hope to raise
$110,000 for the Spina Bifida
Association of Western
Pennsylvania. SBAWP will use
the money for the Woodlands, a
summer camp for children with
spina bifida.

“The money will help them a
great deal, but just as important is
the interaction,” Evantos said.

“We’re also having a program
where each fraternity and sorority
will adopt one, two or even three
children who have spina bifida
and do things with those children
like take them to dinner or invite

them to events," Evantos said.
“We’re getting away from the
competitiveness and more
towards the charity aspect of
Greek Week.”

Although a carnival this
Saturday kicked offGreek Week,
the rest of the events do not
begin untilMarch 15. Greek Week
ends on March 23.

Two new events have been
added to this year’s Greek Week:
a ﬁve-kilometer run/walk through
Schenley Park and the carnival.
Like all Greek Week events, these
two activities are open to

everyone. The entrance fee for
the race will be donated to spina
bifida, and Greeks will run for
donations from sponsors.
According to Evantos, some of
the children from SBAWP are also
going to participate in this event.

This year’s Greek Week will
also feature traditional events with
a few new twists.

“At the god and goddess
competition, a comedy routine
by each participant has been
added,” livantos said. The god
and goddess competition is a tal-
ent competition sirnilar to the

Miss America and Mr. Universe
pageants.

All Greeks are being encour.
aged to wear togas at the chariot
races to promote authenticity.

Most houses are finalizing their
entries for Greek Sing, a song-
and—dance event.

The dance marathon, a 24-
hour event, will also help raise
money for SBAWP.

“One thing we're really trying
to stress this year is Opening up
Greek Week to everyone in the
university and in the community,"

livantos said.

Greeks airn to raise $ 1 10,000 for Spina Biﬁda

By Christopher Barthel
For The Pitt News

Pitt Greeks hope to raise $110,000 for
the Spina Bifida Association of Western
Pennsylvania by the end of Greek Week.

Gay Simpson, the executive director of
the SBAWP, said she is very excited about
the benefits that come with being selected
as this year's Greek Week charity.

“It's a very large donation,” Simpson
said, "and it will be part of a building-
construction campaign. lt’s not going to
go to our operating budget.”

The building campaign is a $2.9 million
fund-raising effort that will build new
dorms, a new pool and two other buildings
as part of the SBAWP “Campaign for the

Woodlands” project. The Woodlands is
where the SBAWP has its Camp Variety, a
therapeutic summer—camp program which
was established in 1983 for children with
spina bifida.

Although the money is welcome, there
are other benefits to being the Greek
Week charity, according to Simpson.
Simpson said her organization faces a lack
of public awareness about the association
and spina bifida in general.

“When I tell people what it is, I always
tell them, ‘You know what it looks like.
You just don’t know what its name is,”’
Simpson said. She added that almost all
the “poster children” of other nationally
known charities have spina bifida, but
they never use the actual name of the

disease on the posters.

“'l'hat’s why the public doesn’t know the
name Spina Bifida," she said. “lfveryone
knows the image of the poster child with
the long hair and the cute little braces. But
they don’t know what the name is because
it’s just been hidden under other names.”

Spina bifida is the second most common
birth defect in the United States. It is a
congenital affliction in which a baby is
born with its spinal cord open to the air.
Spina bifida can also cause a condition
known as hydrocephalos, or an excess
accumulation of fluid on the brain.

Until the 19605, only about 10 percent of
babies born with spina bifida survived.
However, with the advancements in
antibiotics and a new treatment to release

the excess spinal fluid in the brain, survival
rates are now much higher.

“Even though it is a fatal disease in its
most severe. form, there are people with
spina bifida who are surgeons, opera
conductors, attorneys and teachers. It's
not fair to say that their life is normal
because it is not. It’s challenged. It is more
difficult because it is a serious disability,”
Simpson said.

Simpson said the future for spina bifida
patients is much brighter.

“It used to be these babies were in the
hospital anywhere from three to six weeks
after birth. Now, just recently, two babies
went home from the hospital in just five
days," she said. “Things have really changed
in the last 15 years. lt’s just great.”

Q; Isn't affirmative action “reverse
discrimination?”

A: While most Americans agree
discrimination is wrong, problems
arise when attempts are made to
correct past prejudice. Some
people argue that since
discrimination is illegal, no extra
eflort is necessary to eliminate
past prejudice. Others argue that
past bigotry and prejudice cannot
be erased overnight. Since
discrimination complaints are
difficult and complex, govern-
ment must take an “affirmative
action” to do away with prejudice.

The role that the government
should take in this matter is
currently a subject of controversy.

he said. “I think it’s pretty much
balanced —— [the media shows]
the peace protests. And I think
it’s all right to show these protests
because lthe U .S.1 is a democracy.
I’d be sad not to see them.”

The organizers of the teach—in
felt that taking “five hours [for the
teach—in! out of six weeks of
media attention still doesn’t begin
to balance” the coverage of the
war, according to Iris Young, an
associate professor in the
Graduate School of International
and Public Affairs and a member
of Faculty and Staff for Peace.

The media is biased against the
military, said Rob Iewis, public-
relations director of the College
Republicans. “Claims by the anti-
war lobby that the media is against
them are utterly false. Actually it’s
quite the other way around,” he
said.

Lewis said Media Monitor
reported that most television news
programs opposed or questioned
U.S. presence in the gulfat a time
when the public supported war.

'Ihe teach—in fulfilled its mission

of educating the university
community, said Lisa Koch, an
assistant professor of mathematics
and a member of Faculty and
Staff for Peace. “This was a
wonderful opportunity for people
to have a chance to learn more
about the whole crisis," Koch
said. “All the events were filled to
beyond capacity.”

But Army Lt. Col. Michael
Geoghagan, professor of military
science, said the organizers of
the teach-in were wrong to invite
only pro—peace speakers. “If
you're going to have a teach-in,
you should present both sides of
the issue,” he said. “If the object
was to present only one set of
views,” said Geoghagan, “the
teach—in was a raging success."

99

I Iowever, pro-war students and
faculty were given many
opportunities to discuss their
views with the speakers at the
teach—in, said Young. “No one
with opposing views to the
speakers was mu’/.;/.led at all.”

The groups sponsoring the
teach-in anticipated that people
supporting the war would attend
the workshops, said Young. “The
organizers of the teach-in hoped
there would be discussion  and
that if people held different
opinions, they would be aired,"
she'said.

Ilowever, a formal debate
between representatives of the
military and pro—peace speakers
would have educated students
about the war, according to Lewis.

could be aided because of the
allied attack, which put coalition

This initiative came only two

Some reports said that 12
Americans have died in the

The report was released only
three hours after debris from an
Iraqi Scud missile destroyed a
U.S. military barracks in Dhahran,
Saudi Arabia.

At least 12 U.S. Marines were
killed and 25 more were wounded
in the attack, which claimed more
lives than combat in the first two
days of the ground assault.

Iraq also warned allied troops

said Iraqi troops would defend
themselves against any allied
attempts to restrain their
withdrawal.

This could prove to be difficult,
however.

Allied troops have reportedly
moved 50 miles into Iraq, moving
close to the Iraqi withdrawal area.

Iraq has suffered heavily
throughout this campaign. Some
reports said that the Iraqis had
lost 30 to 40 percent of their
artillery and tanks before the
ground war began.

“I find it distressful that it
couldn’t have been organized
like a debate on the issue,” he
said, “which would shed more
light on things than a symposium
on anti—war feelings.”

According to Young, informal
debates were held at many of the
workshops at the teach~in. “Not
only did they ask questions in
the workshop I led with Tamara
Ilorowit'/.,” but the audience
members debated the war, Young
said.

Geoghagan said US support
for the war probably makes the
work of pro—peace groups
difficult. ‘‘It must be terrible to be
a peace protester when we’re
kicking everyone’s behind,” he
said. “lPeace activists] have a
hard time when the war’s going
so well."

“It’s a wrong war and the fact
that the US. wins it doesn’t make
it right. If anything, it makes it
more shameful," said Young.

Lewis said pro-war representa-
tives should have been involved
with the teach-in. “I’d like to see

are a number ofthem ——who be-

.. raising some points the other
side hasn’t heard before,” said
Lewis.

Geoghagan said he did not
attend any of the speeches at the
teach-in. “I stuck my head in at
one event, but 11 was in uniform,
and] it appeared I wasn't
welcome,” said Geoghagan.

It was unnecessary to invite
military officers or other pro-war
representatives to speak at the
teach—in, said Koch. “But there is
a need to hold some educational
events such as a teach-in in order
to present information that people
weren’t getting.” There is a
constant barrage of pro-war news
with only “peeps from the other
side," she said.

The public hasn’t heard much
about what will happen after the
war, according to Kaiser. “One
thing a lot of us  need is more
information," she said.

If more information about the
war is made available, public
support for the war will decrease,
said Koch.

Laing responded to Posvar’s

changes,” Laing said, referring
to the 14 demands the BAS
released yesterday.

Posvar’s statement
encourages the BAS and the
administration to work together
to increase the number of
minority students and minority
faculty members at Pitt.

“We are encouraged by what
appears to be a commitment to

improvement," Laing said.

Posvar’s statement points to
$3 million the university spends
every year on minority students
and minority issues.

“I believe racial relations on
this campus have openly
improved in recent years, and
that Pitt is a more tolerant place
then it once was," Posvar said.

Laing encouraged the

make these kind of changes that
are necessary to make this a
recommendable university, then
it’s just not a recommendable
university," Laing said. “I'm not
an economist, but I believe that if
you want something bad enough,
you can make a difference. I
don’t think we can accept that
nothing can be done because we
have no money because
obviously they’ll keep managing
to do some things, so it’s a matter
of guns and butter, and in this
case it’s going to be the way you
allocate resources.”

If the BAS demands are met,
the selection of a new university
president will not affect its
demands, Laing said. The new
president must be responsive to
those demands, he said.

‘‘I think ifthe university was to
accept these things and agree
that they were going to be
accepted, then it would just be a
matter of telling the person who
you are hiring, "lhis is what you've
got. I)o you want the job and
work with this, or do you not find
this important?’ If they say ‘We
don’t find this important,’ then
they are not right for the University
of Pittsburgh because these are
the things that the students feel
are necessary.”

One BAS demand deals with
expanding the black studies
department.

“The reason that is extremely
important is because the black
studies department is supposed
to hold the traditional disciplines
from a black perspective, and if
you have no economist or no
historian, that's like having no
economics department,” Laing
said. ‘If the university is serious
about their black studies

<2

department, they have no choice
but to make those kinds Qf
additions.”

Another demand asks for
additional monies in the
University Challenge for
Excellence ftnancial- aid budget,

“llﬁ they want to be serious and
continue to bring black students
in, they need financial aid to be
increased,” Laing said. Financial
aid is also crucial in keeping

black students at Pitt, Laing said. Ox

Hiring counselors to help set
U p study groups was among other
BAS demands.

“It's been proven that when
you study together, you do better,
and so we want information on
how to set up study groups on a
very wide-scale basis. It’s an idea
we’ve had for a long time, but it’s
hard to implement when you're
not used to conducting large-
scale operations like that,” Laing
said. _

Student Government Board’
president BrentSaunders said that
he feels the BAS should have
presented its demands differently.

‘‘I think they should have taken
their key points and the ones that
are really important and go all
out in seeing the accomplishment
of those goals," Saunders said.

Saunders was only commenting
for himself and not the entire
SGB, since the board has not
seen the demands vet.

Saunders said he especially
supported the idea of a study— ‘

group counselor and the points "

concerning black faculty.
However, he thought those
important points may be
undermined, by some 'farfetched
points.” Among those, Saunders
said, is the idea of the van
transportation to off—campus
events.

New phone rates will save $330,000

 

Byjean Lewis
Sta_[]' Writer

The University of Pittsburgh’s long-
distance telephone rates will be reduced
March I to save the university about
$330,000 annually.

The deal, which was ﬁnalized with
AT&T, will lower rates considerably for all
Pitt departments and students who are
Student Telephone Service customers.

Bruce A. llutthison, director of the
Computing and Information Services
telecommunications division said, “The
large volume that the university can bring
to the marketplace and the investment
over the past four years in technology
allows us to take advantage of the
extremely attractive hi gh- volume services. ”

The university averages over 1.3 million
calls every month, with student use being
highest in the evenings.

llutchison said, “What we've done for
the student user is negotiate more
attractive rates in the daytime. It will still
be less expensive after 5 lp.m.l.” I Iowever,
the rate reductions will not be limited to
student users. All callers who use STS
will benefit from the new agreement.

For calls made within Pennsylvania,
the long- distance rates will be /10 percent
less than AT&’I"s direct-dial rates ifdialed
between 8 ant. and S p.m., Monday

Stamp increase could cost $300,000

By Jennifer Skriba
Stu_1f Writer

I)ue to the /t~cent increase in first-class
stamps, the University ofPittsburgh faces
a potential $30(),()()0 cost increase if the
volume of mail is not reduced.

The university sent out four and one-
half million pieces of mail last year,
according to Gus Tytke, manager of
property and mailing services.

liach department has a set budget for
postage, and Tytke said that most
departments watch their budgets.

i‘I suspect there will be some decrease
in mail volume,” saidjohn Vrana, director
of central business services and assistant
vice president for administration. But
Vrana said that some things cannot be

cut. I It: said in this case there will probably
be a budget re-allocation or a reshuffling
of funds.

Tytke said he has not seen any reduction
in mail volume yet, but he said he thinks
people will become conscious of what
they are spending.

“People are monitoring and managing
budgets and may actually be spending
less to compensate," said Vrana.

Some departments may also choose to
fax things instead of mailing them or may
send them third class or bulk rate to cut
C()SlS.

Vrana said he thinks the real increase
will be about halfofthe potential increase,
but he said because of the university's
large budget, funds can be adjusted and
the impact will not be that significant.

Palestinian state on Israeli border topic of Masaa’a meeting

By Debbie Lincoln
Stag‘ Writer

The formation ofa Palestinian
state on lsrael’s borders after the
Persian Gulf war was discussed
at the Masada/Students for Israel
meeting Sunday evening.

Amit Sega], a member of
Masada, said a compromise
between Israel and the
Palestinians needs to include
some form of self-government
for the Palestinians.

“You have to evaluate moral

and security risks pragmatically
without bringing up emotional
fears that don't necessarily
belong in a rational discourse,”
he said.

A video was shown that
discussed the military dangers
involved if Israel were to give
up control of the disputed West
Bank. According to the video,
the Israelis have exclusive
control ofthe area, which allows
them to detect enemy forces
early.

This allows Israel defensive

control of routes leading to
strategically vital parts of the
country, including the airport,
industrial centers a ndjerusalem,
the capital, said the video.
Many group members said that
by relinquishing support of the
West Bank, lsrael’s security
would be compromised. In
addition, many said the West
Bank would not be an adequate
concession for radical
Palestinians, who feel that the
entire state of Israel should
become a Palestinian country.

“When you’re talking about
Palestinians in a Palestinianstate,
you have to be sure ifradicals or
moderates are in charge,” said
Greg Shtrahman, a graduate
student who had lived in Israel.
“I don’t know if realistically you
could have a moderate
Palestinian state. That's the
problem.”

Marc Reiter, president of

Masada, said that if the West

Bank were controlled by
Palestinians, it could have been
used as a launching ground for

Scud missiles, which would have
cut reaction time for the Patriot
missiles to under a minute.

Dan I"inkle, a member of
Masada, said Israel has lived for
many years with hostile
neighbors whose missiles have
been pointed at Israel. These
countries have so far restrained
from attacking.

“Syria has missiles today that
can be there in a minute, but
they haven’t fired," he said.

The group also gathered to

When the Black Action Society said last week, “we
cannot recommend this institution for black people any
longer, " several deficiencies in Pitt's academic and cultural
environment were noticed by the BAS. Yesterday the BAS
outlined a 14-point plan that, if implemented, would
better Pitt for the black student now and in the future.

The plan, which includes an increase in black faculty
members, expansion of the black studies department and
cultural and social programs, among other points, is
offering the university administration a comprehensive
list of troubles at Pitt for blacks, as seen through the eyes
of black students. , _

In a statement released yesterday, President Posvar
respondedto last week's action by the BAS saying that he
“affrrmledl the right of Pitt students to express their
opinions on the quality of social justice and equal
opportunity on this campus.  Unfortunately, I think a
more meaningful way to improve the diversity of this
university is not to encourage minority students to stay
away but to work toward enhancing campus diversity to
add to and strengthen your voices of concern."

He then typically reacted to the situation, rather than
taking the initiative, adding that, “I invite you to join with
us as we move to increase the number of minority
students and minority faculty at Pitt.”

We assume that this statement means that Pitt will now
put its money where its mouth is and start comprehensive
talks with the BAS about where money needs to be spent,
where it will come from and numerous other points.

Posvar’s assertion that the situation for minorities has
improved over the years is not good enough. The fact that
some progress has been made does not mean that the
administration's job is complete. The gauge of the situation
for African—Americans on campus should be how the
African-Americans themselves feel. The black students on

campus have spoken. The administration must now .

respond to their demands.

Unfortunately, the fact that Posvar spoke through a
press release and that The Pitt News received the
statement before the BAS leads us to believe things will
stay the way they are.

We commend the BAS for outlining a plan to improve
things after saying that it could no longer recommend Pitt.
This proves that it is not simply willing to criticize Pitt, like
some in the university community do, but is ready to
specifically state the things that need to be changed.

While we are unsure of the feasibility of some of the BAS
demands, it is the responsibility of the administration to
look into these demands. The administration must prove
its commitment to Pitt's African—American community
with actions, not just lip service.

7115»! WHAT?

Have you ever been in a
situation where you just said too
much? The ‘open mouth-insert
foot’ kind of deal? Or has it ever
been the other way around?
Someone just will not shut up.
They keep going and going,
humiliating you to the point that
you want to rip their face off.
Huh?

Everyone, at least one time in
his or her life, has been at one
end of the proverbial stick —
some both at once, some more
often than others. But still, it
happens. We all make little boo-
boos here and there. My question
is, why are there people out there
who continue to keep on doing
this terrible, terrible act without
even thinking about it?

It is quite unfortunate that in
this day and age adults still lack
the trait of being tactful. I guess I
have to clarify the meaning of
“this day and age‘ to everyone.

What I mean is that after we
have had Freud psychoanalyze

 

Lane
Hornfeck

the human brain out the kazoo,
and we have spent so much
money on the aspects of higher
education, you would think that
this country would be able to

. teach its citizens how to be tactfui.

Possibly the government’ could
donate money (ha!) to every
college and institute a mandatory
etiquette course. Then people
would not only know the meaning
of being tactful, but also everyone
would stop leaving the cap off
the toothpaste!

Oh, I forgot! We are in the
middle of a war. I guess that
means we can throw everything
else out the door and let the war
issue become the front mnner.
We must not forget that if Saddam
Hussein had manners and tact,
we (as in the military, no offense
intended) would not be overthere

right now. If he would have asked
nicely for Kuwait or for the
International Palestinian Peace
Conference, maybe we would

not be in this war at all. Yeah, _

right.

Hmmm. So what does that tell
you? If you have tact and manners,
you won't start a war? No. If you
have tact and manners, you will
hopeﬁrllyget along with everyone
a lot better. Then the world will

become a better place, and’

everyone will thank you for it
Now doesn’t that sound nice
—to make the world a better
place, to be nice to one another?
Is that too much to ask for?
Huh? Well, I guess I have been
mostly facetious, but I do think it
is extremely important for us as
Americans, as citizens, as human
beings to be nice to one another.
Maybe we could stop all wars.
Maybe, just maybe, even this one.

BAS statements need clarification

The political-action committee
of the Black Action Society feels
as though because of the many
developments during the past
week in regard to discussion of
the university some clariﬁcations
must be made.

1) BAS did in no way intend to
“urge” black students not to come
to this institution. We simply said,
“We cannot recommend this
institution for black people any
longer.” The fact that TbePtttNews
interpreted this and other
comments to mean, “BAS urges
black students not to attend Pitt"
is, at best, unfortunate and, at
worst, uncritical and misleading.

That is the difficulty we had
with TbeP1'ttNews article, and we
did not mean to insinuate that the
other misconceptions stemmed
from the negligence of The Pitt
News. Thatsaid, we would like to
now deal with some other
misconceptions. \

Letters

2) We did not say black students
should go to black schools. We
said, investigate that option
because we feel there are some
beneﬁcial possibilities.

3) We never said anything about
transferring.

4) Please keep those points in
mind when hearing about this
issue through the media. The
representation of our people has
historically been distorted and
deceiving. If we are not extremely
careful, the media will have us
hating our friends and loving our
enemies.

We hope this clears up the
confusion, and that it is apparent
that the BAS was and is doing its
best for the black community
both inside and outside of Pitt.

The Political Action
Committee of the Black Action
Society

saddened by BAS move

I am deeply saddened by the
news that the Black Action Society
feels that Pitt is so insensitive to
their needs that they are willing
to visit high schools to advise
black students to go elsewhere
for their education. Although the
tenured faculty of the chemistry
department is 100- percent
UWEM, we are aware of our
responsibility to help educate all
students.

Still, it is clear that one of the
main things we can do to
encourage black students is to
locate and hire black faculty. This
goal will be difficult to achieve
because the number of black
candidates is very small.l...l

Stopping Shorter will be key for cellar dwelling Eagles

By Scott Campbell

Assistant Sports Editor

CHESTNUT HILL, Mass. —— If
one player typiﬁes the Boston
College Eagles’ season this year,
it has to be Doug Able.

First, Able had his two front
teeth knocked out by St. John's
forward Malik Sealy in a game on
Feb. 13.

Two games later, he almost
had his nose broken against
Villanova. He was held scoreless
in that game for the first time in
two years while playing half-
dazed.

To say the least, Able, like the
Eagles, has been taking a physical
beating in the Big East this year.

After beating Providence 80-78
last Dec. 11, the team has lost 13
consecutive conference games.
The Eagles stand at 11-16 entering
tonight’s game against Pitt at the
Conte Forum.

Able, a senior tri-captain for
the Eagles, had done his share,
but BC Coach Jim O'Brien has
had to rely on four freshman for
much of his offense this year.

The group of first—year players
is led by Billy Curley, who came
to BC touted as the most highly
recruited player ever to sign at
the school — in any sport.

Curley leads the team in scoring
(11.9 points) and rebounding
(6.9), but he too has taken lumps
inside for O’Brien.

‘'1 expected it to be very
physical, and it is,” said Curley,
"[butl we’re just not getting the
job done. We’re not playing a
complete game.”

“Nothing has really gone wrong
this year. We’re just playing a lot
of young kids,” said O’Brien.

Part of the Eagles’ problem has
been trying to establish a
consistent scorer. Able is second
to Curley in most categories (11.1
points, 6.1 rebounds), but
freshman Howard Eisley was the
only other Eagle to average
double figures in points (10.1).

“I don’t think any other team in
the league has had to rely on
freshmen the way we have, with
the possible exception of

Georgetown,” said O’Brien. “And
they have it kind ofeasy because
they have players like lDikembcl
Mutombo and [Alonzo] Mourning.
Not to take anything away from
our upper class, but we don’t
have that same luxury.”

Indeed they don’t. The Eagles
have only one player bigger than
215 pounds——sophomore center
David Hinton (5.7 points, 2.6
rebounds), who checks in at 6-
foot-11 and 240 pounds.

Compare that to the Panthers,
who have six, including Brian
Shorter, Bobby Martin, Darren
Morningstar and Chris McNeal.

This is also a team that lost
seven lettermen from a squad
that went 8-20 (1-15) a year ago.
For that reason, Curley, Eisley,
Gcrrod Abram (8.7 points) and
Malcolm l-Iuckaby (6.8 points,
/i0—percent are three-pointers)
have received a quick but harsh
baptism into the punishing Big
East.

“We’ve had some shooting
problems this year, and we make
too many mistakes at the end of
games,” said O’Brien. "But I think
we played pretty good this year.
Our win-loss record might not
back that up, but we have played
competitively.”

As for ending their 13-game
losing streak, O'Brien said
containing Shorter is the key if
the Eagles are to have any shot
tonight.

“We have to stop him more
than anything else, " said O’Brien.
"We’ve had a hard time containing
him in the past.”

Shorter scored 68 points in three
Pitt victories last year against BC
and averages nearly 20 against
the team in his career, but they
held him to six points in 21
minutes in the Panthers’ 82-74
victory on Feb. 9.

‘We wanted to hold him, and
we were in the game until about
six minutes to go, but [Pitt] also
has an outstanding perimeter
game,” said O’Brien. “Uasonl
Matthews and [Sean] Miller hit for
nine three-pointers in the first
half, and you have to be able to
guard them too.”

Boston College will look to break its 13-pine conference losing streak tonight in Chestnut Hill.

Pens need to get tough on the road for playoff stretch

It’s a matter of opinion. If you hold to
the theory that all the Penguins have to do
is get into the Patrick Division playoffs,
then Sunday afternoon's 5-5 tie at
Washington is a good thing. If you want

home—ice advantage in the postseason.

twirl, then blowing a 5-3 lead with less
than four minutes to play is bad news.
There is still a lot of puck to be played

I this year, but Sunday’s game certainly

provided proof that the race for a playoff
spot is never over until the final game of
the season. The Capitals showed that
they've still got life, while the Pens proved
for the billionth time that they are not
going to bar anyone from the race.
Sunday’s game was a wild, ﬁght—filled
fracas of intense, hard-hitting NHL action
at it’s scramble for the playoffs Patrick
Division best,in a physical weekend that
saw the Pens literally get muscled out of

New Jersey Friday night in a S~2 loss.

While Friday’s loss saw the Pens get
bounced around by an aggressive, ready-
to—play Devil squad, Sunday showed the
Pens’ more physical side, as they stood toe
to toe with a goon-infested Washington
lineup.

Jay Caufield had a busy weekend by
mixing it up with two of the league's
toughest in New Jersey's Troy “Clam”
Crowder and Washington’s John Kordic
(twice). Also on Sunday, Troy Loney and
large Alan May had a good go in a battle
that Loney apparently got the better of.

Pens Coach Bobjohnson said that power-
play goals are capable of stopping the
rough stuff, and the Pens struck like
lightning three times with the main
advantage on Sunday and went 5 for 11
over the two—game weekend. Johnson
also said the the Pens need to kill penalties

Brian
Berger

better, particularly on the road. The team
responded by holding the Caps zero for
five while killing 10 of 11 penalties in the
two games. Yet the Pens have only one
point to show for it. What is it going to take
for this team to win on the road?

For starters, the Pens are going to have
to respond if a team tries to out-muscle
them. On Friday the Devils came out and
attacked the Pens from the get-go with
solid body checks and grinding. The Pens
should have been ready for it. They’ve got
to become more intense and physical

‘down the stretch, but actions and words

don’t always socialize together. Remember

what happened to the Pens last year.

Another thing the team desperately
needs is a healthy Mario Lernieux. He
missed Friday’s ‘ game, and the Pens
struggled offensively in five of five
situations. While the Devils may have
outworked Pittsburgh, Lemieux has an
amazing ability to neutralize physical play
by scoring points. Lernieux was in action
on Sunday and chipped in a goal and two
assists, giving him 21 points in 10 games.
Lemieux has got to get tough and play,
even if his foot is bothering him.

The Pens are going to try again — this
time tonight in Los Angeles —- to win a
game on the road. They are winless in
their last seven and have a tough task
against a dramatically improved Los
Angeles team that presently leads the
Smythe Division. The Pens men move

Three members of ski racing team reach Nationals

By Brandy 1.. Simms

For Tbe P!!! New:

For the first time in its four-year history,
the Pitt ski racing team can boast a
championship—caliber squad. Last weekend
at Seven Springs the Panther women skied
tremendously well as a unit and qualiﬁed
for the National Collegiate Ski Association
Collegiate Ski Championships in Bend,
Ore., from March 13 to 16.

“I think it's a huge accomplishment for
the women's team to qualify for nationals
— especially since regionals were very
competitive,” said sophomore Jen
Giovannitti.

The men's and women’s teams competed
at the Mid-Atlantic Regionals at Seven
Springs last weekend. Schools from three
different conferences were represented:
the Allegheny Collegiate Ski Conference,

Lacrosse club Whips
Mountaineers, 14-9

By Spencer Borisoff
snap‘ rv.-rm

A rowdy crowd gathered at

ball past the Mountaineer goalie
and into the net, giving the
Panthers a 1-0 lead.

"The team came out firing and

which is the conference the Pitt skiers
compete in; the New Jersey Collegiate Ski
Conference; and the Southeastern
Collegiate Ski Conference.

Senior Robb Alarcon, who hasn't lost in
the giant slalom all season, didn’t
disappoint his teammates, coming away
with a victory in Saturday's race. His
performance enabled him to finish first
overall in that category.

The Panther women, who came in third
place overall, were once again led by
Karin Helm and Erin DeSantis. Helm, a
senior, finished fourth in Saturday's giant
slalom and second in Sunday's slalom.

“I can say that in my four years on the
team, this was the best team ever in
regards to ability and attitude. I'm going to
miss them,‘ said Helm. DeSantis placed
fifth in Sunday's competition. Unfortunately
for the Panthers, Helm, the women’s team's

top racer, will be unable to compete in
nationals because she will be on her
honeymoon. On Saturday she's getting
married to teammate Anthony Carrestia.

Team president Tina Negi, Giovannitti
and DeSantis will represent the team at Mt.
Bachelor, Ore.

For some, the highlight of the trip came
on Sunday, when twin brothers and
Olympic medalists Phil and Steve Mahre
made a special appearance. They skied
the slalom course and presented awards at
the ceremony. But for the Pitt skiers this
might have just added to the celebration of
having three teammates make the all-
regional team.

The teams are divided into men's and
women’s teams; three conferences combine
to make a region, and the top 10 skiers
from each region earn a berth on the team.
Panthers gaining a spot on the women’s

team were DeSantis and Helm. Alarcon
was Pitt's only male representative.

The Panthers must now gear up for
nationals, but the team lacks funds because
it is not officially a varsity sport. It may
have to miss an opportunity to bring
notoriety to the university.

‘After competing against some of the
best skiers on the mid-Eastern seaboard, I
can honestly say that our women’s team is
one of the best,” said team president Tina
Negi.

PIT!‘ BITS: The Allegheny Conference
captured five of the six slots alloted to
Nationals... Though the weather was the
best that the ski racing team has had this
season, the heat caused the course to be
rutted and hard to manuver... Reaching
Nationals is the highest goal attainable for
Pitt's ski racing club.

Mountaineer Field last Saturday,
hoping to cheer the West Virginia
Mountaineers’ lacrosse team to
victory over the Pitt Panthers.

Before too long, however, these
spectators were looking to cheer
themselves up.

The University of Pittsburgh’s
lacrosse team dominated its
opening game of the season from
start to finish in a 14-9, ‘not as
close as the score indicated‘
victory over WVU.

‘We dictated the pace of the
game from the opening faoeoff,'
head coach Gary Neft said. ‘The
score is not indicative of how
badly we really beat them.‘

Pitt got on the board early and
often and never looked back.
Just 20 seconds into the game,
Iiee Stember took a pass from
Dave Kounas and cranked the

got oil’ to a quick start," co-
captain Eric Weber said. ‘That
took a lot out of West Virginia,”
he continued.

By halftime Pitt had posted a 9—
3 lead, and the mountain men
were looking at a rocky, uphill
climb the rest of the way.

‘It was a combined team effort,"
Neft said. ‘Our defense played
great, and our offense moved the
ball especially well.‘

Pre-eminently potent for the
Panthers was Stember and Josh
Gochnauerwhotallied foursoores
apiece. Russ Hugo punched in
two goals and added four assists,
while Weber contributed four
assists as well.

Pitt is now 1-0 and will play
Slippery Rock University at Pitt
Stadium on Thursday night.

Hockey club resorts to rough stuff, comes up with two wins

By John Labriola
saw‘ Writer

You know the old saying, ‘I
went to the ﬁghts last night, and
a hockey game broke out?" Well,
last weekend the Pitt hockey
Club epitomized that old adage.

The team spent much of its
time in the penalty box. The
Panthers earned 34 penalties in a
three-game stretch for a total of

* 97 minutes.

On Friday the Panthers found
the Rockets of Slippery Rock
University to be a bunch of duds
and skated away with a 7-3
victory. On Saturday Pitt took on
the Dukes of Duquesne
University and found that it had
bitten off more than it could
chew, losing 3-0. On Sunday the
Panthers defeated the Apaches
of Indiana University of
Pennsylvania 5-3.

Against IUP the Panthers
dominated in both scoring and
penalties. Pitt earned 13 penalties
for 38 minutes, while the Apaches
had only 9 penalties for 22
minutes.

The Panthers found themselves
skating at a faster pace against
the Apaches than they had during
most of their other games last
weekend.

During the first period Pitt
managed to net two consecutive
goals while holding the Apaches

Gymnasts come away from Temple with second place finish ’

The lines between first, second
and third place were clearly
drawn, but not the way the
Panthers and Coach Frank
D’Amico had expected.

D’Amico figured York
University (of Toronto, Canada)
would show up at Temple on

scoreless. Scoring the first two
goals for the Panthers were Rich
Skalosky and Bill Crousey, with
assists going to Crousey and Kip
Linse.

The second period opened with
Pitt shorthanded, but the Panthers
refused to allow the pace to slow
down. Pitt's penalty—killing squad
managed to keep the Apaches
scoreless. The Panthers were able
to net two more goals of their
own, but the IUP squad managed
to get the puck into the net before
the horn closed out the second
period.

Scoring Pitt's goals for the
second period were Skalosky and
Crousey again, with an assist
going to Linse.

The third period of the game
proved to be hotter than the
beginning of the competition, but
not for scoring or shots on goal.
Penalties seemed to be the only
thing that both teams were able
to rackup. The Panthers earned
five penalties for a total of 20
minutes, while the Apaches had
three penalties for 8 minutes.

Both Pitt and IUP managed to
score a goal apiece during this
period. Scoring for Pitt was
Eugene Barilla, with assists going
to Crousey and Fedor. Scoring
lUP’s final goal was Tim Lambert,
with an assist going to Chris
Moore.

Tum captain Dave Koval (shooting) was held scoreless in all three garnes over the weekend.

period Pitt was holding a small
get—together in the penalty box.
All five of the Panthers’ players
who earned penalties during the
third were in the box at the same
time. IUP also held its own little
tea party, but only a party of three
was served.

Looking back over the two

to break its school record,
overpowering Pitt's 265.55 and
York's 250.35. The Owls won
five of the six events and had
individuals capture firsts in all six
events.

Bill Roth, a member of the U.S.
national team, took five of those
six first places and also won the
all-around competition with
58.05. His teammates Jim Van de
Zilver and Ebon Grayman placed
second and third, respectively, in
the all-around, followed by Pitt's
Jorge Gonzalez and Genaro
Severino in fourth and fifth.

“The big surprise was that
Temple was very strong, and the
Canadian team was very weak,’
D’Amico said. ‘I didn't expect
them to be weak. Two-hundred
ﬁfty is a respectable score, but I
thought we all would be in the
running in the 270 range.

‘And I would have predicted
York to be winning this meet and
they ended up last. Temple really
came through.”

Pitt went up on rings first, but

games that led into Sunday's
competition, as the weekend
progressed the Panthers and their
opponents became much more
physical.

When the Panthers and their
cross-city rivals Duquesne get
together, there will always be
good, clean hockey. During

only scored 43.40 — almost 2 1/
2 points below its average team
score on the event this season.

D’Amicowasvery disappointed
‘We had a lot of breaks on rings.
Nobody got 9.05 — not one
person.‘

Fortunately for Pitt, Temple was
also less than stunning in its first
event, floor exercise.

The Owls scored 44.95 and
took a narrow lead of just 1.55
points. York fell out of the picture
early, scoring 36.70 on pommel
horse.

‘It was clear after the first event
that the meet was between us and
Temple,‘ D’Amico said.

But by the meet's halfway point,
it was all Temple. Pitt found itself
down by about six points and
was unable to catch up.

The day was not lost for the
Panthers, however. They scored
a season-high 45.35 on vault and
nearly matched their season best
on high bar with 44.80.

Pitt has been plagued with
problems on high bar this season,

Saturday's competition there were
a total of 28 penalties (Pitt took
15, and Duquesne took 13)
rendered in 68 minutes.

The highlight of the evening
came near the end of the game,
when the referees stopped the
game with 3:23 remaining.

See Hockey, page 14

and although the team suffered
some falls on dismounts Saturday,
it made fewer major breaks during
the routines. Gonzalez scored a
personal high of 9.6 on the event
and placed second, while
Severino took second on vault
with a 9.55.

Too many major breaks and a
poor team perforrnanoe on rings
were the obvious problems on
Saturday.

But D’Amico said his team may
not have been mentally ready for
this meet after having two weeks
off with no competition.

Trying to simulate meet
conditions in practice just didn't
compare to the tension an actual
meet creates. That tension is
necessary to maintain sharpness
and concentration, he said.

If D’Amico’s right, the Panthers’
concentration level should remain
high for the next month or so.
Beginning with this weekend’s
meet at Ohio State, they have
four consecutive weeks of tough
competition in which they'll try
to better their team score with
hopes of qualifying for NCAA
Regionals on April 6.

The Pill News

“si-ioo'r 1'1‘! SI IOOT rr!" is all
you hear from a Pitt home crowd
whenever Tim Glover is in the
game and touches the ball. And
with good reason.

Pitt Coach Paul Iivans was
singing praises to the three-point
shooting ability of the 6—foot-1
freshman from Houston, Texas,
even before the start ofthc 1990-
91 season. Known for his
reputation as a pure shooter with
excellent range, the Panther
coaches traveled to Ilouston to
bring his talents to Oakland.
Glover was heavily recruited by
several Southwest conference
schools and San Diego State as
well. He chose Pitt because ofthe
prestige of the Big East conference
and its media exposure.

“Usually the reason I’m going
in [the game] is because the team
needs a big basket. The coaches
have confidence in me to shoot,
but just because the crowd is
yelling for me to shoot, it doesn’t
mean I’m just going to put it up.
But it's kind of funny when [the
crowd] is yelling for me to shoot
all the time," Glover said.

Glover was nicknamed "Mr.
Basketball” in the Houston area
just one year ago with a long list
of achievements behind him. He
holds the honor of being chosen
the SA All-Greater Houston Player
of the Year by both the Houston
Chronicle and the Houston Post
and was a Class SA first-team All-
State selection in both his junior
and senior years.

While averaging 18 points per
game last year, Glover led Clear
Lake High School to the Texas
state championship game for the
second straight season. Few
school records were left intact
during his reign at Clear Lake. A
record nine three-pointers in one
game and a single-game scoring
record of 39 points were
established before he was done.

I”

But Glover has had to put all
his past accomplishments behind
him and accept his new role as a
reserve player on Evans’ team.
I Iis playing time has been limited
so far, but it has been no surprise.

“I expected this to happen when
I came here, and I would just like
to contribute to the team in any
way I can," he said. Contribute is
exactly what he does when he
gets the chance to perform, as he
has knocked down four of 10
baskets from three-point range
this season in only seven minutes
of action. Ile has only attempted
two shots from inside the long-
range line.

“I’m real confident from three-
point range; when I’m going
good, I don't think I can miss,"
Glover said. “My jump shot’s my
biggest asset. I’m not cocky about
it; I just believe in myself."

But 10 and behold, the
sharpshooter can do more than
just launch the ball to the bucket.
Glover has been working at the
point-guard position in practice,
although he plays shooting guard
in game situations.

With the departure of four
seniors, including shooting guard
Jason Matthews, Glover's role on
the team next season has yet to
be determined. He will be facing
stiff competition from Omo Moses
and Ahmad Shareef at the guard
spot. Shareef has already started
three games this year and has
seen 135 minutes ofaction on the
floor. But he has hit just four of 12
three-pointers. Thus Glover,
playing 128 fewer minutes, is
rivaling Shareefs tenacity from
three-point land.

But Glover realizes he has some
work to do before becoming a
starter on the Panther squad or
even seeing substantial playing
time.

"I just need to improve my ball-
handling and a few other aspects
of my game to set up the jump
shot. But yes, I can dribble and
do some other stulil”

A conversation with Scooter and Slac/eer on the WZAF 

The other day I was sitting
around feeling kind of bored
when I decided to call my old
friend, Scooter. Whenever I’m
bored, I know I can call Scooter,
and we can exercise our minds
by discussing and debating
relevant and topical issues that
occur in the world of sports.

To begin, we resumed a long-
running debate. Who has a bigger
belly—— Georgetown Coach John
Thompson or Fred Flintstone?

I sided with Bigjohn, of course,
mainly because he’s 6—foot- 1 0 and
scares the hell out of me.

But Scooter wouldn’t budge,
sticking with The Fred because,
as he put it, “Face it, compared to
Wilma, the guy's a blimp.”

We got nowhere on that issue.

Next I proposed a new topic,
one that I knew little about but
hoped that Scooter could fill me

in on.

‘Hey, Scooter,” I said. “I heard
there’s a new pro football league
starting next month. I think it's
called the World League of
American Football or WLAF, and
its goal is to spread the great
game of Amen'can football around
the globe. Is that true?”

“Yes, that’s true,” Scooter said.
“But WLAF doesn’t stand for
‘World League of American
Football.’"

“It doesn’t?"

“No. You see, I got a sneak
preview of the new uniforms last
week. WLAF is really going to
stand for ‘We Look Awfully
Funny.”

“Oh, Isee," Isaid. “Why? Which
team has the worst- looking
uniforms anyway?”

“That's easy. The Frankfurt
Galaxy, or is it the Galaxia

l’I.’n1.'I.'\\I

Frankfurters? I’m not sure.”

“Oh, I see. Well, how come if
there’s a team in Frankfurt,
Germany, they don’t have a
German nickname like the
Frankfurt Schweinhunds or
something like that?”

“I’m not sure,” said Scooter.
“But I think it goes back to World
War II. Among the war reparations
that Germany had to pay was that
if it ever got any professional
sports franchises, they had to
have American nicknames. That's
why theJapanese Baseball League
has teams like the Yomiyuri Giants
and the Yakult Swallows.”

“Oh, I see. But this WLAF isn't

just going to be another one of
those spring football leagues like
they had a few years ago, is it?”

“Heavens, no,” said Scooter.
“That was the USFL, which stood
for ‘United States Football League,’
not to be confused, of course,
with ‘USEFUL."’

“Oh, I see. Say, who's running
this whole WLAF show anyway?"

“Mike Lynn. He has the same
power as Paul Tagliabue,
commissioner of the NFL."

“Say, this all sounds pretty
interesting. Who are some of the
teams in the WLAF?"

“Well, there’s the Sacramento
Surge. But they may change their
name before the season starts.‘

‘Oh, I see. Is it because they
realized what a stupid and
ridiculous nickname ‘Surge’ is?”

“No, I'm afraid not. It’s because
San Francisco 49ers owner Eddie
DeBartolo Jr. changed his team’s
logo from the old ‘SF’ to ’49ers’
last week. But nobody liked it, so
the team switched back to their
old ‘SF’ design, and now Eddie
has a truckload of extra helmets
with ’49ers’ written on the side
that he’s trying to unload at cost.’

"The Sacramento 49ers?”

‘Yes, WLAF executives are
hoping that some fans will get
confused and come to its games
too.”

“Oh, I see. But won't those fans
be looking for the old 49ers like
Joe Montana?"

“Yes. That’s why Sacramento
drafted Joe Idaho in the third
round of the league’s quarterback

_ draft.”

“Oh, I see. I've never heard of
Joe Idaho. Where did he play?”

“Our Lady of Sacred Aunt Ruth. "

“So what are some other teams
in this league?"

“Well, there’s the Raleigh-
Durham Skyhawks and the New
York/New Jersey Knights, but
nobody is really sure if that’s two
teams or four."

“Hmmm  that could get
confusing. Any more teams?"

“Well, there’s the Barcelona
Dragons."

“Barcelona Dragons? Who

coaches them?”

‘Jack Bicknell, who coached
the Boston College Eagles to a
29-6 loss to the 3-7-1 Panthers
last year.”

“Wow, can 01’ Cowboy Jack
speak Spanish?”

‘No, that's the beauty of the
WLAF. The only qualification for
coaches are that you come with a
long and successful reputation as
a gridiron innovator."

‘Wait, didn't you say Jack
Bicknell?”

“Well  yes. Anyhow, there is
also the Montreal Machine.”

" Who coaches them?”

‘Jacques Dussault."

“You’re kidding.”

“No.”

‘The underwater guy from
public television?"

“No, no. That's Jacques
Cousteau, but I suppose they
could be related."

“What about the players? Who’s
going to play in this WLAF?”

‘Well, do you remember Jon
Caner?”

‘No.’

‘He played football at Pitt from
1984 to 1987, and was taken in
the first round of the league's
defensive- linemen draft. Major
Harris, remember him? He didn't
get enough playing time in the
Canadian Football League behind
Doug Flutie, so now he wants to
play in the WLAF too.”

‘Oh, I see. But is that all this
league is going to be? Washed-up
college players and CFL rejects?
That doesn’t sound too
interesting. Are you sure
something isn’t rotten in Denmark
here?"

“No. But I believe they're getting
an expansion team in ’94. The
Cool, I think.”

“Yes, yes. But really, are you
sure this isn’t just another attempt
by a major sport to further exploit
its product and expand its
monopolistic reach to a global
scale, all for the sake of a few
dollars?”

“Please. This is professional
football we’re talking about.”

‘Oh. I see.”

Hockey

Continued from page 12

According to Barilla, at the 3:23
mark, Crousey was skating past
the Dukes’ bench, when one of
the Dukes on the bench hit him.

As a result of that incident,
both Coach Jeff Bele and John
Carlins received gross misconduct
penalties for the abuse of an
official. Carlins and Fred Ebert,
who sat in the penalty box eight
times last weekend, were the
recipients of ﬁve—minute ﬁghting

minors and a suspension from
the game. The Panthers also
received a two—minute high—
sticking off the bench and a
penalty for having too many men
on the ice.

The Panthers started the
weekend off a bit more
conservatively. They earned only
six penalties for a total of 20
minutes against Slippery Rock
(which earned five for a total of
10 minutes) on Friday.

Pens

Continued from page 10
north to Vancouver tomorrow
and east to battle Calgary on
Friday. Late night hockey from
the West Coast — a definite
excuse for staying in.

On the subject of improved
teams, the St. Louis Blues currently
lead the NHL in total points. The
Blues are ﬂying high with the
return of Adam Oates, as Brett
Hull moves to center.

The duo responded by scoring

four times on Saturday at home in
a 9-2 rout over Boston.

Oates is for real. Hull is unreal,
and the Blues are starting to feel
like they are the best in the league.
They blew out Boston and
Chicago (currently three points
behind the Blues) in the past two
weeks.

A Stanley Cup in St. Louis just
doesn’t sit right, but if they can
beat the Blackhawks in the Norris,
look out.

Continued from page 7
build support for a proposal
being debated in Congress that
would allow Israel to receive
American and international aid
reserved for front-line states.

“’lhe war has caused over $4
billion in damages to Israel,"
said Reiter. Reiter said mat the
state has lost revenue from
declining tourism, high security
costs, damage incurred from
Scud missiles and an increase in
insurance premiums.

Members of the group wrote
letters asking their congressional
representatives to support Israel
in the Desert Storm
Supplemental Funding Bill so
Israel can be compensated for
its role in the crisis.

will be 55 percent below AT&T’s
standard rate.

The university also has
negotiated reduced rates for
direct-dial calls to Canada.
Callers will save 20 percent of
AT&T’s direct-dial rates when
calling between 8 a.m. and 5
p.m. Callers phoning between 5
and 11 p.m. Monday through
Friday will save 30 percent. Calls

50 percent ofAT&T’s direct-dial

In addition to the rate
reductions, the university calling
cards will be replaced with
Switched Digital Network calling
cards. All calls dialed using the
SDN calling cards will be charged
20 percent below A'I‘&T’s direct-
dial rates for calls made within
the United States.

The bidding process began
one year ago as a part of the
university’s “Campus of the
Future" project to upgrade the
STS. Hutchison said, "We
invested in the infrastructure to
change as things change, when
we first began using the access-
code based billing system in
1987.

“We don’t anticipate raising
those rates for some length of
time. Typically you can getsome
long-term commitments with
that many calls,” said Hutchison.
