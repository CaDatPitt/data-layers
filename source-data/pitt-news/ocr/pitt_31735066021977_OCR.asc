his education for anything.

”My education made me more
of a person and aided me as a
creative artist,” Kelly said. ”To
any young person,_I would say,
‘Get an education. Learn, learn,
never stop learning.” ”

In his introduction of Kelly,
Posvar read a 1933 Pittsburgh
Press review of Kelly's’ perfor-
mance in the Pitt production of
”All "to the Point.” The reviewer
called Kelly ”electrifying” and
said, ’’I wonder what he has in
mind for a career.” ‘Posvar also
introduced a short film of Kelly
performing as a Pitt student.

Kelly, whose honors include
several Academy Awards and-a

File phot A

special Oscarlin 1951, said,

”With all the honors I've been ,

given, the biggest honor I've
received was when I was a young
kid — the learning I received and
retained, not only here [pointing
to his head] but here [indicating
his heart]/’ '

Kelly said of his memorable
moments at Pitt occurred during
the years of Prohibition when he
and several friends were thrown
out of a speakeasy downtown.

_ Gene Kelly was _born in Pitts-
burgh, August 23, 1912 and was
raised in East Liberty where’he

had a dance studio before going

to work on Broadway.

The Universityof Pittsburgh
Board of Trustees yesterday
approved a fiscal year 1988
operating _ budget of $522.8
million. The 1988 budget

" .represents a 11.6 percent in--

crease over Pitt's current budg-
et of $469.3 million and will
require an average 8.1 percent
increase in undergraduate
tuition. /
The new budget’s im-
. plementation hinges on Pitt's
receiving astate appropriation

of $105.3 million, which,

.Governor Bob Casey has.
recommended that the state
legislature approve. _

The 8.1 percent increase
will represent $250 for CAS
undergraduates, bringing the
yearly tuition to $3,350. Other
schools will experience simi-
lar increases in undergraduate

tuition, the greatest being a
$360 increase for the School
of _Engineering. Increases in

Congressmen question Reagan's Kuwait plan  

WASHINGTON — Sen. Bob
Dole said Tuesday there are ’’lots
of legitimate questions” about
whether the U.S. plan to protect
Kuwaiti ships in the Persian Gulf
will heighten the risk of terrorist
acts in the war—torn region..

”I don't think these questions
have been resolved," said Dole,
talking to reporters in the White
House driveway following a

meeting between GOP congres— '

sional leaders and President
Reagan.

Dole, (R-Kan.), said the gulf sit-
uation was ’’briefly discussed” in
the cabinet room meeting. While
Dole said he believes there is
general support in Congress for
maintaining a U.S. military
presence in the area, ’’I think

there [are] differences about
‘tactics/’
White House spokesman

Marlin Fitzwater said the law-
makers ”were supportive of the
policy there” although there was
some uneasiness about the naval
operations. ”They had some
rather technical issues to discuss
regarding naval operations,” the

 

spokesman said.

Three House Democratic lead-
ers, meanwhile, said they don't
expect Congress to block Presi-
dent Reagan’s plan to protect
Kuwaiti oil tankers in the Persian
Gulf.

Dole denies spread
of rumors about Bush

WASHINGTON — Sen. Bob
Dole denied Tuesday that his
campaign has playedany role in
the surfacing of rumors about
Vice President George Bush's pri-
vate life.

Dole, a Bush rival for the
Republican Party presidential
nomination in 1988, told report-

ers ”our campaign is not engaged

in that activity.”

Barbara Pardue, spokeswoman
for Bush's campaign, said Mon-
day that people speculating about
Bush’s private activities ’’should
be ashamed of themselves.”

George Wittgraff, Bush's Iowa
campaign director, said he be-
lieved the rumors of a longtime

Man runs amok in
New Orleans church

NEW ORLEANS —- A man
shouting ”I am the Holy Spirit,
burn all the Bibles,” ran amok in
the St. Louis Cathedral Tuesday,
destroying old statues described
as priceless, authorities said.

”It’s absolutely unbelieveable
— it's like a nightmare,” said John
Frentz, who watched the
rampage.

”He’s the Holy Ghost. He's a
spirit from God. That's all that he

would say,” said police spokes-
man David Adams.

Frentz, the pastor's lay adminis-
trative assistant, said he had just
opened the cathedral and was
doing morning chores when he
heard the man shouting.

He went to the church entrance
area and found a tall, heavy man
with wild black hair standing on
the table where parishioners set
candles to burn for their prayers.

”What are you, a crazy nut?
Get down from there,” Frentz
said he told the man, whom he
described as about 6-2 and 350
pounds

He said the man started throw-
ing lighted candles at him and
jumped down, overturning the
candle stand and the newly refur-
bished statue of Our Lady of
Deliverance.

The plaster and papier mache
statue, which Frentz described as
priceless, about 100 years old
and one of two of its kind in the
nation, shattered.

Vietnam deserter won't
receive court-martial

QUANTICO, Va. — A Vietnam
War deserter who returned to the
United States after 17 years to see
his ailing father fought back tears
Tuesday as he thanked the Ma-
rine Corps for setting him free in-
stead of court-martialing him.

”There are no words to express
the joy I'm feeling,” Douglas G.
Beane said after his release from
the Quantico Marine base, where
he had been held since his return
from Australia. _

Beane, who turned 40 last
week, was driven outside the
main gate of the northern Virginia
base by a Marine escort and
dropped off near a statue depict-
ing Marines raising the American
flag on Iwo Jima in World War II.

Police still on alert

for man suspected
of Oakland rapes  

Jonwells/The  News

By Pete Brasko III

Contributing Editor

Pittsburgh police are "still
searching for a knife—wielding
man who committed three rapes
in the Oakland Avenue area in
the past month. Two of the vic-
tims were Pitt students.‘

Police said the suspect,
described by victims as a muscu-
Iar black man in his 205, about
5-10 and weighing roughly 175
pounds, sexually assaulted two of
his victims at knifepoint and cut
one of the victim’s hands.

The first attack happened, ac-
cording to police, on May 20
when —a woman said she was
raped around 1 a.m. in the 300
block of Oakland Avenue.

.The victim said the rapist told
‘her his friends call him ”Yosemite
Sam,” but he said his real name
was Samuel. '

Then, on May 31, a Pitt student
said she was raped at knifepoint
by a man who jumped her as she
was leaving the laundry room of
her apartment in the 400 block of
Oakland Avenue.

As other people walked by the
laundry room door, the rapist cut
the woman's hand to keep her
from screaming, police said. "

When the passersby had gone, '
the man then raped hervand,

1

forced her to perform oral sex.

Another Pitt student met a simi-
lar fate on June 10, according to
police. The «victim was grabbed
by the rapist as she was walking-
from her Dawson Street apart-
ment_to her car. V

The rapist forced the woman
into her carat knifepoint and
made her perform oral sex.

Then, the man drove around

Pittsburgh in her car but stopped
near West Penn Hospital "in
Bloomfield and sexually assault-
ed her again, authorities said.
The first-victim told police her
attacker had a mustache and a
short beard, while the second

and third victims told police their.

attacker was clean shaven. Other-
wise, their descriptions matched.

Sexual assault squad detectives-

say more women may have been

raped by the man and have not, ’

come forward yet.

So, what should females Iivi_ng
in thegarea do to minimize their
risk of attack? I ‘I . .

”Be extremely cautious,” ad-
vised‘ Pittsburgh Police Com-
mander Therese Rocco.- ”If you

iber. I called 976—CHAT, a line

specifically for teens. At first I
heard a recording telling me to
keep it clean, enjoy myself and
call back often. When I was con-
nected there were two guys and
a girl on the line. Rhonda», 16-,
was the first to talk to me. I told
her why I had called and asked
her why she called the line. She
said she liked to talk to new peo-
ple. I asked if there were a lot of
”weirdos” calling in; she said no.

976

. Continued from page 4 _
”It’s nice clean fun,” said Rhon-
da. ‘it's expensive but it's worth
it.” '

Before I could say anything
else, Billy asked Rhonda for her
phone number. She said no and
then his voice seemed to disap-
pear. Then Andre asked for my
number, and I wouldn't give it to
him.

It seemed Billy and Andre were
getting angry because they were
unsuccessful at setting up a date.
I started talking to Rhonda again,
and one of the guys said to her,
”Brenda’s just like you — a
tease/’. Rhonda started yelling at"
him, and I got cut off. I don't
know why I was cut off after only
three minutes when the charge is
$3 every five minutes. For that
price, I could have called my fa-
mily in England and had a better

conversation and connection.

Teenagers living outside the
Pittsburgh metropolitan area must
also pay a toll charge. Many don't
realize the calls are $3 per every
five minutes, not for the whole
call. The Post-Gazette reported
the case of a teen in California
who used the sex and chat lines
for up to IO hours at a time and
ran up a phone bill for over
$5,000.

Since 976 lines are available to
anyone with a phone, including
children and teens, Bell has in-
stituted a blocking system for its
customers. On June 8 the block-
ing service went into effect. At the
customer's request, Bell will
block the access to any 976 num-
ber from a phone. "This keeps
people from being able to call
controversial 976 numbers but it
also blocks joke lines and infor-

mation lines. The blocking is free '

for 60 days. If the customer wants
to keep it after 60 days, there is
a one time $10 charge.

Halper said, ”We’re taking a
cut inprofits in order to keep chil-
dren off the sex lines.’’ It costs

House approves AIDS education

By Rich Kirkpatrick
Associated Press Writer

HARRISBURG — A House
committee approved revised
regulations Tuesday requiring
schools to teach older pupils that

abstinence rather than ”safe sex”’

prevents the spread of AIDS.

The regulations will be consi-'2
‘ dered Monday by the Indepen-

dent Regulatory Review Com-
mission and should be in place
for the new school year in Sep-
tember, said Rep. Ron Cowell (D-
Allegheny) and education com-
mittee chairman. _

The regulations would require
school distri.cts to teach students

about AIDS atleast once during‘
elementary, junior and senior

high schools.

the adult phone lines and the live
conversation lines, but we are in
favor of anything restricting the
use of adult lines by minors. As
a responsible company, it makes
sense for us to safeguard chil-
dren.” Last year Bell grossed $9
million from 976 calls, and its
profits were about 40 percent of
that gross. Thiry percent of the
profits came from sex lines.

If the blocking works, Bell may
not have to pursue the obsenity
case. Another answer, requiring
access codes to use the sex lines,
is being investigated. The access
code would be like a credit card.
The user would have to prove he
is over 18 in order to get one. The
codes would be provided by the
individual lines.

Another pendingregulation to
ease the parental concern and
anger over the lines is the instal-
lation of recordings at the start of
each, message stating exactly

what the "message contains and-

how much it will cost. Bell wants
the first 15 seconds of the calls to
be free so if the customer wants
to hang up he can do so free of
charge. The recordings would
also inform children of what they
are calling and give them time to
hang up. Bell also wants monitors
on every chat line to keep the
conversation clean and free of
bad influences.

To keep phone bills from
skyrocketing, Bell wants ex--
changes that charge every five
minutes to'provide a tone after
each five minute period so the

caller can keep track of how .

much he spends.

Despite all the problems the_- -

976 lines cause for children and
their parents, there is a huge au-
dience for them. Halper said he
hopes _that when the bad public-

ity from the sex lines and the hor-j .

ror stories of huge phone bills die
down, more businesses will start
to make use of the 976 lines.

New Pittcat makes laying ’cards’on table easier

By Rae Ann Collette

Staff Writer

The four-month renovation of
Hillman Library disrupted the
quiet atmosphere at the 20-year-
old facility during the majority of
last term. The red and green
screens of computer terminals
which serve as the new card cata-
logue system are perhaps the
most obvious change, but the
multi-million dollar project result-
ed in subtle changes all over the
building.

’’It was annoying at first — in
the midst of construction — but
now the finished products are
very helpful,” said Jill Bezek, a
second year graduate student in
the Graduate School of Public
and International Affairs.

_ ”It seems like there are a lot ,

more resources now — not just
manual things. The carpeting

‘ makes the library quieter. It

makes it more comfortable, espe-
cially for people who are here a
lot," she added.

The renovation of the facility,
which in 1985 was ranked 29th
out of the 106 largest libraries in
the United States and Canada by
the by the Association. of
Research Libraries, began in De-
cember when Pitt began to auto- .
mate Hillman Library. I

A new electrical system was in-

- stalled and the wires were co-

vered with new carpet tiles,

_ according to Pam Vance, assis-

tant director for administrative
and access services for the
University of Pittsburgh Library
System.

In addition to the new carpet-
ing, the university installed verti-
cal blinds to replace the curtains,
refinished the tables, chairs and
carrols, replaced the old chairs
with new ‘lounge chairs and pur-
chased about 25 pieces of art
work.

”The formal renovations began
Christmas break, starting with the
switching of the reserve book
room fro-m (3-27 to the lending

. desk,” Vance said.

An increased library staff and
new Pittcat computers are other
changes that have made the
library more convenient for use
by students. According to Vance,
more improvements in Pitt's
library service are being consi-
dered for the future. a

The third floor of Hillman also
underwent renovations — an en-

area, and the photocopiers once

Smoldering on the brink of disaster
Too many times, people need a tragedy to make them think. Monday's fire at 316 McKee Place is a fineexample. Every-

one seems to be saying, ”What if it were me?” _ _ A

There are steps you can take to help prevent your apartment from going up in smoke, literally. Disasters such as Monday's
don't have to happen. When they do, they are often caused by negligence or a lack of common sense.

The smoke detectors in apartments are there for a reason. They can be a bother if they go off when you burn something
on the stove or if you smoke too much, but they really can save your life. Leave them intact.

Apartment buildings are supposed to be equipped with fire escapes, though some aren't because of an inadequate fire

A code. If your apartment doesn't have a fire escape, familiarize yourself with your building, and plan an emergency escape

route in the event of a fire. _

All apartments should have fire extinguishers. Fire extinguishers have limited shelf lives and have to be inspected and/or
refilled periodically. Check the dates on your extinguishers: If they are out of date, take them to _your nearest fire station

A or demand that your landlord refill or replace them.

The fire on Monday was caused by someone emptying an ashtray into a garbage can. The ashes were still smouldering,
and about an hour later, Oakland was minus one apartment building. Please be careful with cigarettes and all other com-
bustables. .- - /.

The above mentioned can help you~prevent a fire, but should one ever strike you residence,-remember these points: Get
out as fast as you can and never re-enter a burning building. Your posessions may be valuable, but nothing is _as valuable

_ as your life.

1

information, you can pick up pamphlets on safety at any fire station and at the Housing Office.

It's too late to bring back Kevin Garren or the building in which he lived, but you can help to prevent‘the same disaster I
from happening again. Think about it. ‘ '

This is a partial guide to fire safety. Common sense suggestions like these aren't difficult to follow. If you would like further

  In the interest of a better education

At yesterday's board of trustees meeting, the budget for the fiscal year.1988 was approved by a unanimous vote.
Included in the budget was measure to increase the undergraduate tuition by an average of 8.1 percent.
According to university President Posvar, the additional funds from the increase will be used to pay higher instructors’ salaries.

A quality education is not an- inexpensive thing, and the cost of providing such an experience continues to grow. There C

is a need to upgrade the facilities of the university: the library, the science labs, the buildingssand the studios, among others.
The increase is going to work out roughly to an additional $250 for undergraduates in the College of Arts and Sciences.

Other schools will experience similar increases.

As is the case with any increase of fees at the university,‘there is bound to be some disapproval among the student body.
The discomfort entailed by the increase though, assuming that the money will truly beused for the improvement of ”instruc-

 tion,” as stated in the budget report, will be more than offset by the benefits of ‘a university better equipped to deal with

the rapidly changing needs of-our society.

.- The philosophy among the university's financial planners seems to be that if the university can afford to pay the professors
more and can afford to support more research, better people, students and instructors alike,» will be attracted to Pitt, enhanc-
ing educational opportunities. . ‘ ' -

It is our hope that the administration will not forget, in their rush to build a ”world-class research institution,” that the
primary objective of a state—supported school-should be the education of the students in attendance. ~

If the increased funds do translate to an enhanced atmosphere _in the classroom, then it will be well worth the added
cost of tuition. There is, though, the possibility that the administration sees the increases in undergraduate tuition as a good
way to raise money for the professional schools and the graduate programs. While those programs are -certainly in need

 of increased funding, that funding should not come at the expense of students who may never participate in them.
 I In short, if the tuition IS to be raised, and the money is necessary for the growth of the university, then we would do

well to embrace the increase. If, however, we are to be footing a greater bill for our education, it would_seem we have
a right to know exactly how the money is being spent. . ‘ - ’ ' A -

I never really knew Kevin Gar-
ren, but I knew of him. When I
‘was a freshman, he did a hilari-
ous stand-up comedy act at a stu-
dent union coffeehouse. I
remember seeing him at parties,
at gymnastic meets, on the street,
etc. I never really sat down and

« talked to him, but he was a face

in the crowd that I recognized.

Pornography leaves him speechless I

cinating — just ridiculously sick. .

I saw a porno flick forlthe first
time last Monday.

It was a video—cassette that
came on shortly after-several of

‘my friends and I had watched
Stand By Me.

How did I go from reminiscing -
-about my childhood days" to -a

sexually explicit film that exists

' for no other reason than to be
. sexually explicit? ‘

Curiousity, I think.

.When I was growing up, sex
wasn't‘ something you talked
about. I never have had a man-

to-man talk with my father about -
V it, and every once in a while, I 
. regret it- i ‘V '

centennial celebration, and the"
money generated by it continues
to roll in. As of this writing, the
total is somewhere‘ in the neigh-
borhood of $90 million.

Congratulations are in order for
all those who have helped to
make thefund drive such a
smashing success.

There is something, though,
that I wonder about. '

At least to my eye, the entire
premise of the hoopla‘surround-
ing the fund—raising effort was that
Pitt had made it through 200
years and was about to embark
on its third century.

Two hundred years is a long
time, to be sure, and for a univer-

sity to have shuffled past that goal I
with the grace Pitt has shown is

a wonderful thing.
I just have a little trouble,

‘though, with the idea that be-

cause a university has been
through 200 years", it is deserving
of some cash.

People in their early_ 20s are
faced with a myriad of issues and

concerns. Mortality is usually not '

one of them. All anyone seems to
think and talk» about is the future,
that this future thing is something
we should plan for, that real hap-
piness lies out there somewhere
and that if we want to have a suc-
cessful one, we've got to work
hard. No one ever stops and
thinks, "Gee, what if a future isn't
in the cards for me? What if I die
first?”'Not a very pleasant sub-
ject, but one that's been on my
mind since _I first heard about
Kevin's death on Monday. _

It's very possible to get so
caught up in planning for the fu-

ture that you lose track of the_

present. At some later date, you'll
be prosperous, secure, and I
guess that will make you happy,
but what if you never make it that
far? What if you endup like Kevin
Garren? He was an ordinary guy,
he just‘ graduated and was still
looking for a job.‘ He was plan-

He is the sort of man who will
talk about trees and gardens and
why the Pirates are mired in last
place. The birds and the bees fall

I into that somewhere, but not in.

the context! was looking for.

The first and last time my father
ever asked me about sex oc-
curred shortly after the break-up
of a relationship I had with a girl

several years ago.

"Was there any sex involved?”
he sa_id_ as we stood over the ex-
posed engine of a '69 Ford
Mustang he was restoring.

There was, but I told him there
wasn't. I was reacting to the

I primary message I'd always got-

ten from him.

"Love ’em and leave ’em’_'is_ a .

I10-I10.

Love them first, and you have ’
to leave them,_‘at least you'll have

they'd be. Not_ _exciting..olr__fas-2

 

Sounds a litt|e_like an ad for
some father and son plumbing
‘company in Brooklyn.

”Give us a try, folks. We've
been around for a bunch of years,
so we must be doing something
right."

I smell an oily little guy in a
polyester suit somewhere in the
background pulling all the
strings. V

I agree that it is important for
a university to raise money. It's

' the stuff that makes the world go

’round. I just wonder about the
tactics. And I wonder about the
people who bought the whole
schtick and got out their
checkbooks.

It speaks very poorly for the

university alumni community that
Pitt had to dress itself up in rib-
bons and parade .around for the
media like some sort of whore
before anyone took notice.

If the university is ever to
prosper in a manner befitting the

ning for his future.

I've, been trying‘ to ‘imagine
what it would be like to have one

of my close friends die. What _

happens after? It's comforting and
very easy to page through a Bal-
timore Catechism and read that
the faithful departed are reaping
their heavenly rewards. I want to
believe that, but I just can't. No
one knows what lies beyond, and
because of that you've got to

A make the most of every day. "To-
day is the first day of the rest of
your life" was an ad for Total
cereal at one time, and it makes
sense.

It's just as important to have a

happy present as it is to plan for

a happy future. It's pretty easy to
loose sight of that sometimes.

Outsiders look at college stu-
dents and think that we do noth-
ing but indulge in wicked
excesses and have fun all of the
time. The truth is, most of us are

more to remember about the per-
son than how strange they look
nude.

So, there I was last Monday,

, several years after my father had

first said the word "sex" to me -
supposedly more mature and
wise to the ways of the world. On
the outside, I tried to present an

-image of disinterest and non-

chalance. On the inside, I was
filled with curiousity. The dread-
fully evil thing called sexlwas
about to be revealed to me in its
most deviant form.

Maybe I did miss out on some-
thing when I was forced to find‘
out what sex was without the ad-
vice of my father, but I haven't
figured out just what. I

Porno’ flicks and the "’evil"' '

therein aren't what I'd‘ thought

be, the emphasis should be on
the programs at the university,
not the age of the school.

Please don’t.misunderstand. I .

agree completely that Pitt needs
money to continue to grow. The
pursuit of academic excellence,
whatever that means, has neve
been cheap. — =
The bills have always been
paid by those members in the
community having the means to
donate large sums of money.

In the future, though, it would

I be nice to see that endowments «

were made because of Pitt's repu-

tation as an institution of higher

education.

Too often, the gifts to our’.

university seem to reflect the abil-
ity of public relations firms and
the quality of a fireworks display.

spective editor for The Pitt News.

dreadfully unhappy, and the I
wicked excesses are an escape.‘

So what are we supposed to do
to find some answers?

Have an honest talk with some— i

one who's the age at which you

expect to happy. I plan to be ‘ '

deleriously secure by the time I'm

35. For the past few years, I've —

who's happy and 35. I've met my

The ones I've met aren't deleri-

ously secure. Sure, their situa- A

tions have changed, so instead of
sweating through term papers,
they sweat through presentations
at work. It's still the same sweat
though.

Remember that when you're

one’s telling you about. Use
some of that energy to be happy
with your present. ~

THE PITT NEWS

Philosophically retarded

‘By Douglas ? Payne
Staff Writer .

John Sch|esinger’s films have always
attempted to further certain sociologi-
cal concerns.

‘ ‘However, The Believers,
Schlesinger’s trashy new opus, veers
_towards territory that pumps the re-
wards of capitalism and consumerism
while flagrantly deflating and demean-
ing the philosophies behind each.

Schlesinger’s sincerity lies solely in
his ability to shock the audience with
the horror and the horrible menaces
that lurk within and around our very
own homes or our very own souls, as
he'd probably have us believe.

/ As its title alludes to little if any-
thing, The Believers (those who con-

‘ vert to the faith ofcapitalism?) is’a

basic stream-of-conciousness scarefest
that never once connects to logic or
reality. J .

  THE WPTS TOP 10

So many purposefully macabre
things happen in this film with little
thought given to_motivation or necessi-
ty. To give them away, however, un-
dermines the only possible reason that
anyone may want to see the film.

Martin Sheen, in yet another intense-
ly convincing role, plays a psycholo-
gist who counsels New York City
policemen. After the bizarre death of
several young boys, which seem to be
occult in nature, and the equally bi-
zarre —_ if not ridiculous — death of a_

cop, Sheen attempts to find out what's ‘

going on.
Of course, Sheen's housekeeper is a

‘ voodoo junkie. Of course, Sheen's

wife dies in a silly accident. Of
course, our hero meets a woman who
lo'oks1'ust like his dead wife. Of
course, Sheen's adorable young son,
purposefully made lovable to us, is
slated to be the next victim.
Ofcourse, there is very’ little logic to

the entire proceedings, and eventually
one begins to question why things go
on as they do: relentless and seeming-
ly unmitigated. The film, to its credit,
does have some genuinely scary
moments. -

Unfortunately, The Believers is sus-
tained on a sick foreknowledge — a
given pretense that something awful
will happen to Sheen's poor young
son. There is a certain perversity these
demented filmmakers have when the

-core ofsuspense revolves around the

vulnerability of children to sick adult

fantasies.
The problem here, I believe, is that

Schlesinger is trying to pass this off as .

”oc'cult drama" rather than the grimly
light-weight horror film that It really IS.
The drama squanders in the undertow

society, but the horror so apparent fills

The Believers —— somewhatperverse occult drama

on his own fickle polemic extremes
regarding consumerism and capitalism
makes us question why we should
spend over $4 for otherwise perverse
entertainment.

Some viewers may find this horror
flick to be sadistic fun, but that does
not deter the fact that The Believers is
philosophically retarded.

 
Is The Believers an occult drama or a' per-

By Jonathan Paul
For The Pitt News

Coming off a recent box-office
disaster, the prince of pop has just
finished two discs worth of the
most diverse tunes he's ever
released.

Not to say Prince hasn't been
experimental in the past, but this
is the time for an album that sums
up what the artist has been going
through or doing with his music.
However, Sign ”O” the Times is
far from being a magnum opus.

The title track is the most ex-.

plicit expression of his world-
watching but does not really con-

of what he is seeing.

”Play in the Sunshine" ’ is
another one of his revivals of
psychedelia mixed in with a funk
grounding, but by the time he
gets to the real meat at the end
of the song (a short guitar solo),
one feels enervated rather than
uplifted. A 

The segueing meanderings o
the song sound like outtakes from
the ‘Around the World in a Day
sessions, but he then lets loose

,with a shout thatreleases the

most satisfying funk—cum-rap
called ”Housequake,” but, this
goes- on for a bit longer than it
needs to. ‘

Hey folks, miss me? , _
It looks like there is a remedy for the ”Boy-I’d-like-to—see-|ocal-

(bands-but-it-costs-so-much-and-besides—l’m-not-21 ” syndrome — the
V Squirrel Hill American Legion. Yes, the legion hall has been home

to Special Ed, The Crowflies, Bone of Contention, the Little Wretches

' and others. It usually costs about $3. If you have l.D., you may con-

sume alcoholic beverages. lf you're under 21., there's plenty of ginger
ale & cola. The hall is at_5857 Forbes Ave., right behind Horizon
Financial. It's a little hard to find, but it's worth it! Watch this space

' for upcoming shows.  '

 ; (The Little Wretches have a record out! It's a single called ”One
Chance in Hell’’_ b/w ”Born'With a Gift” (the title track from The

Wretches’ full length cassette). Look for an LP on The Cynics’ Get
Hip label.  Tom Verlaine's latest LP Flashlight is soon to be released
in America on l.R.S. records  which reminds me to tell you SEE
THE WHITE-OUTS. Their music is a pleasaa ttrip into the past. Not

too far, just about 19.78. The White-Outs are very Television-esque

with a dash of Velvet Underground for good measure. 
Here's a brief rundown of some shows that have been through
town:

0 Henry Rollins: Even though he didn't have the line-up from his '
- recent solo LP Hot Animal Machine, the music was very tight. The
. rhythm section was stolen from Greg Ginn's (another ex-Black Flag)

‘band, Gone. The problem was Hank. He was just a little too caught

V. up in his own intensity.

0‘ Fuzzbox: They- certainly do use their fuzzbox; their guitars sound-

 . ed like kitchen appliances. They were an embarrassment to female

._._Q.; J.

musicians everywhere. It's very disheartening to know talentless, -
-hype-only bands (I'm convinced that Fuzzbox is Sigue Sigue Sput-

nik with‘ breasts) can get contracts with major record labels while

i bands like Johnny Rhythm & the Dimestore 45s (who opened-for ’ J A

0 Adrian Belew: He has a fuzzbox and knows how to use it. This
man has always been an innovator, and he is not stopping now. His
back-up band, The Bears, are no slouches either. Very complex, in-
triguing and entertaining. I -

0 The Lyres: This band has a reputation for revising their line-up

J hourly. Two of the four guys who played The Decade show last week

were on their most recent LP Lyres Lyres. They didn't seem as cohe-
sive as possible, but one attributes that to the fact theguitar player
and bass player were relatively new. Jeff Connolly's distinctive lead
snarl made the Boston grunge rocker’s appearance well worth it .

Did you buy The Replacements’ Please to Meet Me (Sire) yet? 
Suzanne Vega is coming to town. She is certainly a phenomenon.
I'll be there.  Here's something odd — the new X album See How
We Are has two songs featured on other artists’ current albums. The
single ”Fourth of July” is on Dave Alvin's Every Night About This
Time, He wrote the song for X just before he left the band. Then there's
”Cyrano de Berger's Back,” which was penned by X bass player, John
Doe. This song also shows up on the new Flesheaters compilation
Destroyed By Fire. _It was originally done by The Flesheaters in 1981.
Musicians on the West Coast lead such a loose lifestyle — swapping
songs, swapping musicians. i don't know.  ‘

Howard Devoto (Buzzcocks, Magazine) has crawled out from un-

der a rock to do a new solo LP.  Check out The Fall's Peel Sessions
on Strange Fruit records.  Also very good — Wailing Ultimate, a
cornpliation of Homestead Records finest. -

slower tunes of Prince and Dirty

The second side comes on with e

a strained shouting of the man's
primary source of interest, ’’It.'’
The second portrait is yet
another psycho-funk try called
”Starfish and Coffee.” ”Slow

ing of the sentiments expressed in
”lnternational Lover” from the

spent one of the most enjoya-

I have ever had. The event was
the opening performance of
the Three Rivers Shakespeare
Festival's production of "Two"
Gentlemen of Verona’.

For those of you who have
already treated yourselves to
TRSF productions in the past,
I encourage you to see this
one. And for those of you who
think Shakespeare is too stuffy
or unintelligible, I urge you to

It is a delightful production
that will change your mind.

Thank you for giving Pitts-

Prince   I  

Continued from page 10

' sounds an ominous chord for the

man himself. The lyrics betray
Prince's possible desire to settle
down, something not entirely
outrageous, since his white con-
temporary, Bruce, is a man to
whom marriage become a reali-
ty despite his loner qualities.

The second disc starts with ”U
Got the Look,” a ”Pop Life” type
of examination of one’s. image
and how it is used.

”If I Was. Your -Girlfriend”
returns Prince to recognizable ter-
ritory as an adrogyne asking ques-

tions that most American males
. wouldn't dream of for fear of

threatening their masculinity.
”Strange Relationship” pushes
the issue of examination further
by spreading ambiguous doubt
about his intentions.

”The Cross” finally pinpoints
Prince's religous convictions by

painting a bleak picture that will -
be brightened if one believes in '

J.C.  It is also the best example
of Prince's mastery of white mu-
sical styles. In this song he

late '60s and the arena guitar
soungs of the mid '70s.

The music on this album is
diverse all right, even downright
disorganized. It lacks the whole-
ness that characterized Purple

, ‘Rain, Around the World in a Day

and Parade, not to mention his
earlier music.

It's good music in that it's
danceable and fun; however, it
lacks any real punch that would
make it different from previously
released albums. This is, in a
sense, a summation album, but it
falls short of being a well-made
statement. It's like a ‘few sen-

tences strung together that have '

a vague relationship but no real
coherence. '
Speaking of relationships,
Prince seems to be tryingto figure
out what his means to him and

- the audience he plays to.

Maybe he'll soon figure it all

out and give the public another .

scathing self-examination like
Purple Rain. As a teen-ager I got
great satisfaction out of Purple
Rain‘, however, I am growing up,

and want Prince's music to catch ’

up with me and regain co-
heréncy. , ‘

Monticello: America's most outstanding architecture

By Dave Zuchowski

Staff Writer

/1 A  
time oflife when

I was bold in the pursuit of
knowledge, never forgetting to
follow truth and -reason to
whatever results they led.”

These words by Thomas Jeffer-
son could very well apply to any
portion of his long and accom-
plished Iife of 83 "years.

Scientist, writer, diplomat, law-
yer and amateur architect, Jeffer-
son served as governor of

‘ Virginia, minister to the court of

Louis.XV| of France, secretary of
state, vice president and, eventu-
ally, third president of the Unit-

~ ed States. -

A_rchitecture was one of Jeffer-
son's main delights’. In 1769, he
began construction of his self-
designed_ home, Monticello,
which he continued to build and
remodel for the next 40 years.

Initially rejecting the Georgian
architecture of Williamsburg and

Tidewater, Va., Jefferson adopted’
' a neo-classical style in his plans‘
for Monticello and included in ~

his design provisions for the first
dome to be built on an American
house.

Today, nearly all of the furni-
ture housed in Monticello was at
one time owned by either Jeffer-
son or a member of his family. Es-
pecially fond of equiping his
home with copies of gadgets and
contrivances he saw on his jour-
neys, Jefferson included in his de-
sign such novelties as a seven—day
calendar clock, single acting dou-
ble doors that opened onto the
parlor, dumbwaiters that brought
wine up from the cellar and
revolving serving doors that great-
ly reduced the number of ser-
vants he needed. '

The grounds around Monticel-
lo are of almost equal interest.
Both ornamental and vegetable
gardens included many varieties-
of plants and flowers that Jeffer-
son experimented with, hoping
to find the edible ‘and decorative
flora best suited to the climate
and soil conditions of central
Virginia. .

His I000-feet-long vegetable
garden contain’ed over 250 spe-
cies of vegetables and herbs that
included everything from sesame

’ and sea kale to tomatoes — a rela-

tively obscure fruit back then.
Monticello, along with Char-
lottesville and the surrounding
Ablemarle County area, is just a
short seven hour drive from

Pittsburgh.

This jewel of architectural artis-
try is open to the public for view-
ing daily from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.

The first stop for any tourist in-
terested in the area should be the
visitors’ center on Route 20 South
of I-64, about one mile west of
Monticello. The center is a valu-
ablesource of information, maps
and brochures of the area.‘

What should be done ot Gladman and Austin?

”Since learning ofthe involve-
ment of student-athlete Tony
Woods with agents Norby
Walters and Lloyd Bloom, the
University of Pittsburgh has been
actively and aggressively inves-
tigating all matters relating to
agent-player agreements. While
doing this, we have been in cons-
tant dialogue with NCAA staff,
keeping them abreast of our at-
tempts to uncover the facts, while
receiving from them guidance on

 

CI-IRISTOPHEWR
sapasv

procedures and processes as-
sociated with various actions we
should be considering. As soon
' as we have sufficient information
to make conclusive decisions, we

/7 will submit our final report to the

pa

NCAA and at_the appropriate
time release a" more definitive
public statement.”

— Official statement from the
Pitt athletic department concern-
ing the recent accusations against
three Pitt athletes

Looks like the Pitt football pro-
gram is in a real doosie of a

NBA first-round draftpicks -

problem this time.

Seniors Charles Gladmari‘, a
running back whose talents were.
expounding boundries through-
out his college career, and defen-
sive back Teryl Austin, who in
1985 was ranked fifth in the na-
tion in interceptions with seven,
may just have played their last
game for Pitt during spring prac-
tice. They have been accused of
accepting selected monies from
the above—stated gentleman of [?]
vice, Norby Walters, _a New York-
based sports agent. This is the
same agent who lured former
player Tony Woods,the No. 1
draft choice of the Seattle Sea-
hawks and was subpoenaed to
appear before a grand jury be-
cause of his dealings with
Walters.

Hopefully before any al|—too-
familiar bells begin to ring to the
tune of ”Seems to Me I've Heard
That SMU Song Before,” there
should at least be some clarifica-
tion of the facts, because there
have been rumors galore flying,
about it ‘all.

According to some local media
sources, supposedly both of the
players have been suspended
from the team by either the ath-
letic department or Coach Mike
Gottfried. This statement has not
been verified.‘ Neither has it been
verified that, because of the pos-
sibility of truth in the accusations,
the NCAA has declared both of
them ineligible for any more col-
legiate play.’ '

However, because of the seri-
ousness of the situation, it is pos-

sible that both of these courses of

action could go into effect.

Wednesday, June 24, 1987

Charles Gladrnan may have already played his last game at Pitt.

‘What a shame. At the begin-
ning of the spring session I had
the chance to cover for thispaper
the annual Blue—Gold intrasquad

scrimmage game in which both
‘ Austin and Glad_man were stand-

outs. Both myself and just about
every othersportswriter who saw
the game gave rave reviews
about what could be expected

NEW YORK — David Robin-
son and Tyrone Bogues, 22
inches apart in height, were sepa-

J rated by only 11 selections in the
NBA draft Monday.

The 7-1 Robinson; as expected,
was the No. 1 pick by San Anto-
nio, despite theliabilities of a
two-year Naval commitment and
uncertainty about how long the
Spurs will retain the exclusive
right to sign him. ’

The Washington Bullets, with

/*2 the 12th pick, also ignored an ob-

/"\

vious liability when they ‘select-
ed Bogues, a 5-3 guard from
Wake Forest who will become
the smallest player in the NBA.
He will join a team that also has
the tallest player, 7-7 Manute Bol.

”Having Manute at center to -

back me up could take a lot of the
pressure off me,” Bogues said.
_ ”lt’s an honor going in the first
round. I think I turned a few
heads in the [postseason] camps

lieved in me.“ ~ r_V

than last year. Of the first 27';

picks, 12 were guards and four
were centers. ‘

Rod Thorn,_the NBA"s director

said the emphasis on guards is

”There were just more good

Soccer recruits provide some great expectations

The Liberati name is a part of Pitt soc- I‘-.~

By Beth Froelich

Assistant Sports Editor

Pitt's starting soccer line-up is beginning
to take shape with the recent ‘signings of
three area highschool soccer superstars.

Joining the,Panth‘er'line-up this fall will

v be Jay Kapusta, George ”Tripp” Taylor

and Nick Liberati.

' Kapusta of Peters Township High
School will share time on the field this sea-
son with returning Panther goalie, junior
Mark Hendricks. .

Kapusta led his high school to the

WPIAL class AA soccer championships

this year, with 18 shutouts in 27 regular
season games, posting a 0.48 goals-against
average in the 23-3-1. season. .

Pitt soccer coach Joe Luxbacher is
counting on Kapusta to strengthen ‘the
Panther’s defense.

”I consider Jay Kapusta to be the top
goalkeeper in the WPIAL,” said Lux-
bacher. ”Kapusta is a great all-around ath-

.let.e who has the physical and mental

makeup to be a collegiate goalkeeper. He

has played against good competition year-

round and will help solidify our goalkeep-
ing situation. He is a good addition to our
team[’ .

Kapusta shows the same enthusiasm in
his decision to play for Pitt._

‘'1 can't wait to play for Pitt,” said'Kapus—
ta. ’’I chose to play at Pitt over West Vir-

ginia and Maryland because Pitt will allow
me the opportunity to play right away. I'm
not too sure what collegiate soccer will
have in store for me, but I expect it to be
more challenging than high school soccer

Another addition to the Panther’s defen-

sive line—up will be Taylor.

Taylor, who played halfback for
Lampeter-Strasburg High School, will be
playing as a midfielder for‘ Pitt. —

Springdale High School's Liberati is the

third freshman recruit coach Luxbacher"

has signed.

Female volleyball star heads
to the U.S. Olympic Festival

cer lore, Liberati’s older brother Dan is a
defensive player for the Panthers, as well
as the team's senior co-captain.

Liberatiled Springdale to the WPIAL
championship last year with 31 goals and
20 assists.

The Pitt soccer team will open their sea-
son against Slippery Rock on Sept. 9 at Pitt

Stadium. Coach Luxbacher believes his ‘__

team will be succesful this year. ‘

”We won a couple of indoor tourna-
ments already,” said Luxbacher. "If our
players come back ready, we can have a
good season.”

Denise Frawley, volleyball in
the summer is a completely
