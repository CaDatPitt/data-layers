Steven Wright scratches his ‘itchy teeth’ during last night’s concert at Soldiers and Sailors Hall.

By Brett Gilman
For The Pitt News

Last night there was no intricate stage, no
vulgar language and no loud screaming — just
comedian Stephen Wright, a microphone, a
wooden stool and “a mix of two glasses of H and
one glass of O.”

Wright played to a large audience at the
Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall as part of
Homecoming Week and, joking in what he
called a “surreal and abstract” fashion, he kept
the audience laughing from beginning to end.

Wright also made fun of the obvious. “It
doesn’t matter what temperature a room is
because it’s always room temperature,” he joked.

Although Wright, after 12 years, has gotten
“used to seeing people laugh,” it is still a good
feeling for him.

He said it is much more difficult playing a
college audience then a mixed one because
“college audiences are much more demanding,
and you can get away with more when you have
a mixed audience.”

Wright says his greatest inﬂuences were Woody
Allen and George Carlin. He said he knew that

Good taste should

O’Connor says shared

By Megan Bertino
Asst. News Editor

Students, faculty, staff and
administration should all have a
say in university governance Pitt
President]. Dennis O’Connor told
the university senate yesterday.

Under shared governance,
faculty, students, staff and
administration would have the
opportunity to take part in the
decision—makin g process of issues
that would affect them, O’Connor
said.

“I believe that this great
university must be governed
through active, informed
participation by all constituencies,
particularly when those
constituencies are directly affected
by the axioms of policies,”
O’Connor said.

O’Connor also said he sees a
“profound need for greater
communication between all
constituencies of the institution.”

He added that the responsibility ,

for-better communication begins

with himself.
“It is my challenge to keep the

perception and the reality open
on this campus to convey to you
an honest dialogue, to convey to
you information you need,” he
said.

O’Connor stressed that while
decision making is important,
faculty and students should not
lose sight of the fact that their

governance key for Pitt

purpose at Pitt is to learn and not
to get caught up in university
politics.

O’Connor also addressed the
recent controversy over budgetary
matters.

“I perceive there is a problem
of trust on campus, that in the
past the faculty were not
adequately informed of important
budget information,” he said.

O’Connor said he has asked
the Senate budget—policies
committee to help in budget
making decisions at the university.

O’Connor asked the Senate and
faculty for “your support and
your trust  I offer you my trust.”

O’Connor said he comes before
the faculty as “first among equals.”

He said he will be returning to
the position of a professor next
semester. He will teach a biology

class. O’Connor said he
considered himself to be “a
scientist on loan to

administration.”
In other business, history

Professor Fritz Ringer presented
O’Connor with a petition signed
by 250 faculty members asking
for a government body composed
of elected faculty members. The
petition also asked that the faculty
vote have equal weight in electing
members of university
governance.

O’Connor said the issue was
something that should be
considered.

Absence of the father
Wounds, author says

The absence of the American father is wounding men and
women alike, author Robert Bly said in a speech at Carlow

“When men are rejected by their fathers, it will bring your
whole culture down for you,” he said. “Women suffer from this

Bly, a leader of the new “men’s movement” and author of
Ironjolm: A Boole About Men, opened his address by reading
poetry and accompanying himself on a lute—like instrument. Bly
is also well known as a translator and as a National Book

Men’s problems intensified when the Industrial Revolution

removed the father and his work from the home, Bly said. The
absent father created a “father hunger” in young men, who
were unable to identify with their fathers and their work.

“The father comes home around 5 or 6. He’s been at the
office, probably harming the earth all week  He comes back,
and he’s been shamed and humiliated by older men in the office
 In this exhaustion he comes home. He doesn’t bring teaching
into the room  He comes home only with a mood” that is
irritable and angry, according to Bly.

“One young man said, ‘I know what a father is. It’s someone
who rattles papers in the living room,’” Bly Said-

he wanted to be a comedian when he was 13 and
saw people like Bill Cosby, David Brenner and
Johnny Carson making people laugh.

One of his greatest thrills was meeting Carson
on the Tonight Show. He said being on the
Tonight Show “was being like that kid who
dreamed about pitching in the major leagues
and one day realizes he is pitching in the seventh
game of the World Series.”

Sharon Dougherty, a first-year student at Pitt,
said she came to see him because “he is the most
hysterical comedian today.”

Last night’s performance was sponsored by
the Pitt Program Council.

Wright was in usual form, displaying the
monotone, expressionless style that he is known
for. Dressed in a blazer and jeans, Wright, with
his long hair, beard and subtle movements joked
about everything from waking up in the morning
to kicking babies. He also strummed a few songs
on his guitar. '

“I woke up in the morning, and I had instant
coffee so I would have the energy to make
regular coffee,” he jested. .

Wright offered handy advice for those job
hunting: “Whenever I fill out an application — in

-case of emergency notify — a doctor. What the

hell is my mother going to do?”

Upward Bound helps
pre-collegiates adjust

' By Cindy O’Leary

For T be Pitt News

Pitt’s Upward Bound chapter
held its annual New Student
Orientation banquet yesterday.

The national college- and
university—based program
provides high-school students
with an atmosphere for social,
cultural and educational
development necessary to build
a strong foundation for college,
said~project director Dr. Renee
Frazier. 7

“We expect you to succeed
and demand academic
excellence," Frazier said in her
address to the students.

Frazier also spoke of the cultural
aspect of the program, stressing
that “cultural awareness allows
students to grow and broaden
their minds.”

Frazier told UB participants that

' they are encouraged to provide

feedback on activities, and to
have a voice in the program's
structure and emphasis.

UB is a part of an umbrella
operation grouped under the
College of Arts and Sciences’
University Challenge for
Excellence programs.

Director Dr. Chenits Pettigrew
said that Upward Bound is an
environment that provides
counseling and academic support.

“The program has enhanced
the educational support students
receive at area schools and has
increased their chance of success
here at the University of Pittsburgh
or other institutions,” Pettigrew
said.

Sharyse Simonson, chairperson
of the Student steering committee,

the program. “I was given a

St/IR discusses Thomas

By Mike Laughlin
For T be Pitt News

The Clarence Thomas conﬁrmation stirred debate among
students at Tuesday night's Students Against Racism meeting.

Some students said they felt that Anita Hill should have come
forward with her accusations against Thomas when she worked
for him at the Department of Education and the Equal
Employment Opportunities Commission.

Others said they felt that an all-male Senatejudiciary Committee
was insensitive to what Hill experienced. Some students said the
country’s general reaction to the charges against Thomas was
a “blame—the—victim” response that’s very typical of the male-
dominated society we live in.

Discussion also ensued about what can be defined as sexual
harassment. -

STAR members agreed that when words or gestures of a
sexual nature make a victim feel uncomfortable, and the person
doing it refuses to stop this behavior even after the victim has
made it clear that it's making him or her uncomfortable, this
constitutes sexual harassment. 9

STAR members also agreed that touching was a form of
harassment, along ‘with blatantly demanding sexual favors in
return for job promotions and special privileges.

Some students said they felt that Hil1’s charges lacked
substance because no touching on Thomas’ part was ever
mentioned during her testimony and Hill continued to work for
Thomas when he was appointed to the EEOC, after the alleged
harassment at the Department of Education.

THE pm NEWS, Thursday, October 17, 1991

 

By Carolyn Oliver
For T be Pitt News

Competition was stiff at the
homecoming Monopoly
tournament, but Ken Segarnick
walked away with a total of $8,964
in property, houses, hotels and
cash. -

“It’s just a game,” Segarnick
said. “I played a fun game of
Monopoly.”

This was the first time such an
event has been held at Pitt,
according to John McKotch, the
recreation director of the Pitt
Program Council. He coordinated
and supervised the tournament.
“I got some information about it
in the mail and-it stuckrout, so I

decided to do it,” he said.
McKotch said he hopes that the
tournament will become an
annual homecoming event. He
said that students who would not
be interested in things like the
Cathedral Climb would like this.
The tournament, in which 23
students participated, was made
up of two 1-1/2 hour elimination
rounds. At the end of the time
period, the players totaled up the
value of all the property and cash
they had. The top six scorers at
the end of the first round on
Monday came back and played
Tuesday night. p _
Segarnick said that his strategy
helped him win. “The railroads

Mitscherlich has written that when
a man grows up with a distant

« father, demons will appear that

tell him the father is evil.

Men are largely unable to
mourn their unsatisfying
relationships with their fathers,
Bly said. Modern humankind
suffers from an inability to mourn,
according to Bly. He said the
United States hasn’t yet mourned
the Vietnam War.

“We cannot move forward until
we’ve buried these bodies .. We
need to look hard at what is
happening to us.”

Men need to transform their
anger into mourning, he said.
“Depression is when you refuse
to descend into grief. If you don’t

can't choose when to come up.”

Boys become men through
being initiated by older men, and
this induction into manhood is
largely absent in U.S. culture, he
said.

Bly has identified four stages of
initiation into manhood.

0 Bonding with and separation
from the mother.

The increase in the number of
men living with their mothers is
one sign that this separation is
not occurring, Bly said. As well,
the single mother often turns to
her oldest son as a substitute
husband and_ confidante,
committing a kind of psychic
rape. The mother's criticism of
the father often turns the son
against all men, he said.

-The man’s marriage with his

“Every man has a man on his
right side and a woman on his
left,” Bly said.

The men’s movement has been
wrongfully depicted as a “whole
bunch of guys jumping around
naked in front of a fire and rolling
around in the mud,” Bly said.

“I’m not going to roll in the
mud. My hair is too beautiful,”
said Bly, who has an impressive
mane of white hair. “The men’s
movement has to do with facing
grief.” ‘

Bly commented on current
‘events involving conflicts
between men and women.

“I still feel some sadness over
the vote [confirming Clarence
Thomasl,” Bly said. He “felt tears
in his eyes” when Thomas was
confirmed by .“reptilian
Republican senators.”

He said he could understand
why it took Anita Hill 10 years to
come forward with her
accusations that Thomas sexually
harassed her. It took Bly until he
was 48 to be able to confront his

anger toward his father, he said. _

He also praised Deborah
Tannen’s best-seller about the
inadequacy of communication
between men and women, You
just Don ‘t Understand

He described thefrustration of
women whose husbands “don’t
talk at home, and you go to a
party and there he is, delivering a
half-hour lecture on the
Galapagos sea tortoise. "Men use
language for “report,” and women
use language for “rapport,” he
said.

“Men and women chain each
other so easily  Women alone
say things they never say in the
presence of men and vice versa,”

Television is eroding American
culture as well, he said. “Thirty-
six channels? What did we do to
deserve 36 channels?  A hundred
years ago entertainment was done
by an old than and an old woman
who knew 97 hours of stories.”

“Where are we going?” and Bly

Ax the ‘tomahawk chop’  

When the English stole property from native Americans
in the early days of this country’s history, they not only
tricked the natives out of land but they also raped the
natives of their heritage, which for centuries the Indians’
descendants have been attempting to regain.

Hundreds of years later, after the persecution has
supposedly ended, the violation has resurfaced. Not
surprisingly, it’s from an age-old American tradition.

The Atlanta Braves, widely known this week as the
major opponent of the Pittsburgh Pirates, have been
accused by Indians’ rights groups of mocking native
Indians with their highly publicized “tomahawk chop.”

The chop consists of fans in the stands systematically
waving paper or foam replicas of an ancient Indian axe.
This action, according to The Pittsburgh Press, “extends
portrayal of native American people as being warlike,
aggressive, having asavage approach,” said Aaron Two
Elk, regional director of the American Indian Movement
in Atlanta. . ..

Although this may not be the Braves’ or their fans”

.3.” intentions, it is obvious that the chop is offending a race

of people whose ancestors were violated by Americans.

Also included in the chop is a battle cry, which is
symbolic of ancient native American chants.

These cries are insulting to native Americans in that the
fans seem to be portraying their ancestors as bloodthirsty
savages. . _»

While the team "might be unknowingly _offending
particular races, the fact remains that people who have
taken great lengths to preserve their heritage are continually
being insulted by the actions of these teams.

Offensive language and actions are not new to anyone.
In the days when Americans refused to allow the United

.4... States to become a “melting pot,” certain words became
a means of identifying groups of people based on the
pigmentation of their skin. A

“Red” became associated with Indians, just as “yellow”

' was with Asians. Caucasian was synonymous with “white,”
and “black” was to represent African-Americans.

American Indians’ desire for equality is most often
overshadowed by..the requests for respect from other
ethnic groups, but that does not mean that their fight to
gain understanding should be ignored.

A Concerned American Indian Parents’ leader Phil St. John
also told the Pressthat: “People in Atlanta don’t realize that
they’re talking about an entire race of people.”

Sadly enough, this is often true.

The insensitivity to native Indians may not be intentional,
but the fact remains that the tomahawk chop offends
certain racial organizations.

To alleviate the anger of these ‘ groups, the Atlanta
-Braves might replace their symbolic chop with an
inoffensive action that would still inspire their fans’ to

‘support them.

Eating disorders inﬂuenced by media

What does society expect from

women? Open any magazine; V

look at the advertisements and
you’ll ﬁnd out.

Why is it drilled into our brains
from dayone by the media that
our self-worth is equal to and
measured only by how we look
—— how thin we are, howibeautiful
we are, how our hair, skin, body,
nails and teeth look? A

Our self—images are shaped by
how we measure up to the
expectations of society. For some
it is much worse than others.
How else can you explain the
alarmingly high percentage of
college women with eating
disorders?

For some it is the stress of
college, being away from their
pa rents and on their own for the
first time without supervision.
For others it is a way to numb
feelings and avoid stressful
situations. _

_ If women are always thinking

' about food and dieting, then

there’s not time to think about
the fight they had with their
mothers, the. test they took
yesterday, the paper that’s due

« tomorrow or the guys in their

classes who won’t give them the
time of day. No matter what the
reason, it is a hell they must
endure and a habit they must
break.

Feeling fat is a good excuse to

avoid life. Because being thin is

so important in our society, a
woman with an eating disorder
has fooled herself into believing
that someday, when she has

Barbara
Hoffmann

achieved the “perfect”.body, she
will have a “perfect” life —— but
this day never comes because
she may never be satisfied.
Eating disorders are so often
misunderstood that when we do
know of a friend that we suspect

of having one,‘ we don’t know _

what to do.

My first year I knew ﬁve girls
on my ﬂoor with eating disorders.
They all wanted that perfect body
and would do anything to get it.
It didn’t matter that they were
damaging their bodies and
neglecting their lives because they

‘were totally consumed and
completely obsessed with
becoming thin. I guess they felt

_ that taking control of their eating
meant taking control of their lives.
In their eyes, everybody would
love them if they were thin, and
they would finally be worth
something. i

The ideal feminine body has

changed many, many times
throughout the decades. There is
‘no way a woman can keep up
with these trends. For example, a
woman with an athletic, muscular
body type would never expect to
become bone thin, but she'll try
because that is the “look” of the
moment and she wants to be
attractive.

At the turn of the century, the
voluptuous Gibson Girl was the

body type every woman strived
for. It is virtually impossible for a

petite woman to become a full- ‘ ‘

figured, voluptuous dreamgirl.
V Except for the 19205 ﬂapper,

, women before 1960 could rely

on undergarments to hide or
revise their ﬁgure flaws. Then

came the bikini. The bikini forced __

women to not only lose extra
weight but also get rid of any

figure ﬂaws — because the bikini 9

hid nothing. This is usually
unrealistic because most of us
are born with a certain body
type, and no matter how many
sit-ups or leg-lifts we do, we will

never look like Christie Brinkley V

and still be healthy.
Every decade we are expected

to look different and conform to

the style of the times.

Our body type is something
we cannot change and must
accept. It is not an outﬁt we can
toss away when it goes out of
style.

Self-acceptance is the only way
to happiness or at least

contentment. If you are always, '

striving for that unrealistic, perfect
body, you miss so many other

parts of life. I’m not saying eat - '
everything insight and expect _

people to accept you at 350
pounds, but don’t strive for an
unrealistic weight because you

think your life will suddenly be '

perfect when you lose 10 or 15
more pounds —— especially when
you_look ﬁne the way you are.

Like a bullet through the temple, the
Pittsburgh experimental jazz scene is
oozing with force this weekend (and next
Saturday) for a three—day affair of noise.
Last year AB concerts and the New Music
Ensemble teamed up for a similar three-
‘day binge of bliss, offering avant pop
heroes No Safety, the near-fusiony Curlew,
the mass of Borbetomagus and others.
This year’s lineup is just as angry and
arguably more free-sounding. The festival

York and Chicago downtown legends,
Over The Edge 11 (the official title), will

feature three dangerous local (OK —

area) outfits to be reckoned with,
something last year’s bash lacked.
Leading off the series will be a special
night, as the ‘Burgh’s own jazz bandits,
Watershed, unveil what promises to be an
excellent debut record, entitled PowerSmp.

Shivkumar’s approach to the
performance of the santoor. ‘
After more than three decades of

achieved international acclaim.
He is recognized as one of the

“There was skepticism in

'couldn’t recreate everything

express,” Shivkurnar told the
Los Angeles Times of his early
attempts at adapting the santoor

THE PI'l'I‘ NEWS, Thursday, October i7, 1991

By Brian Berger
Showcase Editor

The turbulent world of hip-
hop music continues to have a
major impacton today’s society
yet remains an underground
scene. Since this is a college
newspaper and essentially
underground, this will be a hip-
hop column in a hip paper (and
for those of you who’ve been
sleepin’, a beat(ing).

Some slammin’ LPs out now to
consider, and Cypress Hill is still
thedopest — literally. South-
Central swing.

The new Public Enemy album
is thumpin’, although I don’t know
what to think, except every time
I hear it, I think. “Get The Fuck
Outta Dodge” is gettin’ major ride
time.

A Tribe Called Quest is well
worth the $, at least as far as
today’s prices go. .

“Scenario,” with the Leaders Of
The New School (whose tape
you better own), is righteous, as
is the still-slammin’ single, “Check
The Rhime.”

Russell Rush’s RAL label got
some new wax out with the
harmonious Nice and Smooth.
I’m not with it, although “Down
The Line” not only drops Gang
Starr’s “Manifest” loop but also
borrows Keith EE and the
incredible ‘DJ Premier on the
cross-fader. Hype.

Ice Cube and Sir Jinx got
sum’em goin’ on in the production
corner as well as a new offering

. entitled Def Certificate, originally

due to drop in late October, but
it looks more like late November.
That is cool as long as they bring

us fresh singles’ like Del The "

FunkEe Homosapien’s ‘fSleeping
On My Couch b/w Ahonetwo”
on Elektra. Jinx and Cube keep
the production simple, while
allowing Del to rap in mad
freestyle. Look for somethin’ large
at the beginning of November
entitled I Wish MyBrother George
Was Here, which you might recall
from De La’s first record. Cube,
Jinx and Chilly Chill step up to
the boards for WC and The MAAD
Circ1e’s debut, Ain’t A Damn
Thing Changed. They. turn ugly,
throwin’ hardcore beats while
WC and MC Coolio rhyme about

If you ain’t with the Pete Rock
and CL Smooth EP, All Souled Out,
on the got-it-goin’-on Elektra
label, it’s time for knowledge.
Pete Rock’s production and DJ
skills are devastating, and CL
Smooth is all that.
_ Also on Elektra are the Brand
Nubians, who are set to strike
again with the jumpin’—off 12" of
“One For All” (No. 1 ‘in the
upcoming Latifah-on—tha-cover

year after dropping the phat

debut, the Now Rule Mob has still
got the rap world paralyzed. But
the Nubians are actually decaying.

Russell, who has been around

Are the Nixon Cloc/es in time for the bigleozgues?  

By Larry Chough
Staff Writer

As you walk down Ellsworth
Ave. in Shadyside, you pass the
Artery, an art and music club _that
features local artwork as well as
live music six nights a week. A
high-tech sound pulsates from
within the walls as you near the
club. Complex drum rhythms and
pounding bass notes enhance
the melodic keyboard lines
coupled with counter—melodic
guitar lines.

This sound comes from the
Nixon Clocks, a hot band that’s
rising to the top of Pittsburgh’s
local-music scene. Catch them
now, before they’re off to take on
the -bigger picture.

The Nixon Clocks offers a wide
variety of music based on the

formula of a four-piece rock band
consisting of: Barry Hilgert on
vocals, keyboard and guitar; Jeff
Sebolt on lead guitar; Mark Adams
on bass guitar and Mike Nee on
drums. _

Although the term “wide
variety” provides a somewhat
vague interpretation of the music,
Hilgert’s inﬂuences range from
the folk style of John Denver to
the stylistic guitar of Todd
Ru ndgren to the experimentation
of Peter Gabriel. To add to the
sound’s uniqueness, Hilgert and
the Nixon Clocks manage to take
these diverse influences and apply
them to its_own original sound.

Hilgert, 24, formed the band
(formerly called HSI) with Sebolt,
25, when the two met in 1987 and
found that besides the fact that
both were studying to be pilots,

they had a common interest in
music, particularly the progressive
scene. Neither had ever been in
bands before, but they decided
to try their luck in the music
game together. Sebolt would add
the biting sound ofR.E.M.’s Peter
Buck to Hilgert’s own style.

As HSI, they practiced in an
airplane hangar in a Butler airport
where they also practiced their
flying. Originally a cover band
playing popular songs by other
progressive-oriented bands, HSI
toured the college circuit and
garnered , a considerable
following, particularly at the
Indiana ’ University of
Pennsylvania. Gradually the band
started to write its own material
and slowly weeded out the covers.
As they began to change their
format toward being an original

band, they started to bring their
sound to Pittsburgh, playing such
clubs as the Electric Banana and
Graffiti. In Pittsburgh they
changed their name to the Nixon
Clocks and started to establish
their reputation as a 'top—flight
band and develop a loyal
following.

Since the band formed, Hilgert
and Sebolt went through, a difficult

process of findingthe right bass
player and drummer to provide
the right edge to complete their
sound. Finally, in the spring of
1990, they found the right players.
They picked up Adams, 25, on
bass and Mike Nee, 23, on drums.
Adams, originally from Penn Hills,
has been an integral part of he

THE PITT NEWS, Saturday, October 19, 1991

By Rob Mazur
Sports Editor

If the Pitt running backs could
pick a week to take of f this season,
it probably would be this
weekend. As the Panthers head
into their homecoming matchup
‘with the Syracuse Orangemen,
they run into a team that only
gives up an average of 102 rushing
yards a game. '

This actually could be good for
the Panthers this weekend, since
starting tailback Curtis Martin and
running back Glenn Deveaux are
listed as doubtful for this week’s
contest.

Martin suffered a sprained right
big toe on the opening play of
the game against Notre Dame.
He left the ﬁeld after the first
series of downs and did not return.
Martin was not able to’ put any

weight on the foot after the game.

“I just don’t know if Curtis will
be ready to go,” said head coach
Paul Hackett. “He hasn’t been
around here long enough for us
to know how he heals. Some
guys heal really quick; some don’t.
I do know that he will be playing
right away as soon as he’s ready
to go.”

Deveaux reinjured his right
ankle later in the Notre Dame
contest. This injury has haunted
him throughout his career. He

had strained it earlier this year_

against Minnesota but had
returned to the lineup. A
“I think that Glenn will probably

be able to play this week, ” Hackett
said. “He always seems to come
back and be able to contribute.”

Pitt is left with a backfield of
Kevin Williams, Jermaine Williams
and Vince Williams, should neither
Deveaux or Martin be ready to

’ play. Kevin Williams had his best

game of the season last year
against Syracuse in a game the
Panthers rallied to tie.

The Panthers, however, have
more to worry about than the loss
of two players. They will face a
Syracuse defense of Saturday that
only surrenders rushing yards like
the Texans did at the Alamo. The
102—yard average a game is

played. The Orangemen beat
Florida in the Carrier Dome three
weeksago. In that game they
shut down highly touted Gator
back Errict Rhett, holding him
under 100 yards’.

The Orangemen are led on

including 52 unassisted. The
second—leading tackler on the
team is Young’s counterpart at
inside linebacker, John Lusardi.
Lusardi has 60 tackles on the
year, 26 of them unassisted.

However the Orangemen have
been hurting at the other
linebacking positions. Dan
Conley was lost for the year due
to an injury in Syracuse’s second
game of the years against
Maryland. Then, just this past
week, the Orangemen lost their
fourth—leading tackler in OLB Jo
Jo Wooden to a torn ligament
suffered in Syracuse’s loss to East
Carolina.

The Orangemen’s defensive
line, while a bit undersized, has
held its own this year. The three-
man line averages about 6-feet,
2-inches and 254 pounds. They
are led by nose guard Kevin
Mitchell, a 6-1, 245-pound
sophomore out of Harrisburg,
Pa., who has three of the line's
five sacks on the season. Mitchell
was recruited as a linebacker/~

THE PITT NEWS, Saturday, October 19, 1991

By Rob Pugliese
Staﬂ“ Writer

Syracuse head coach Paul
Pasqualoni enters Saturday’s Big
East showdown with Pitt with
good reason for concern.
Although the Orangemen offense
boasts a deep and frightening
arsenal of weapons, it has failed
to produce a second-half point in

I its last three games.

“We’ve had an inconsistent past
two and a half games, ” Pasqualoni
said. “Against East Carolina we
self-destructed throughout the
entire game both offensively and
defensively.” —

Against Tulane the
inconsistency didn’t hurt, as the
Orange rolled 24-0, but the last
two weeks have proven fatal.
Syracuse trailed top-ranked
Florida State only 17-14 at the
half, but the sputtering second-
half attack produced a 46-14
Seminole rout. Last week the
Orange took a 20-10 lead into the
locker room, but two missed field
goals in the fourth quarter opened
the door for a 23-20 East Carolina
upset in the Carrier Dome.

Despite its recent deficiencies,
the Syracuse offense remains a
quick—strike, highly explosive
attack which presents several
significant problems for Pitt.

The Panthers have always
struggled against mobile

quarterbacks and option attacks.
As last week's performance at
Notre Dame will attest, nothing

  
  

I

has changed. Syracuse throws
the football efficiently for big
yardage and also runs an effective
power game as well as the “freeze”
option. Toss in a quarterback
with exceptional scrambling
ability, a backup quarterback who
represents a completely different
dimension, and what you have is
a big problem. The Panthers will
need an outstanding scheme and
ﬂawless execution to slow down
Syracuse. .

The Orange have rolled up 377
yards per contest with probably
the most well-balanced attack
Pitt has seen. Their most
publicized weapon is junior wide
receiver Qadry Ismail, but the
catalyst is field general Marvin
Graves. The sophomore
possesses that rare blend of
elusiveness, athleticism and
passing touch that produces
nightmares for defensive
coordinators. Last season Graves
scared more defenses with his

feet than his arm, but he has
shown tremendous improvement
with his passing.

“He studies very hard. Marvin
Graves has a great work ethic,”
Pasqualoni said. “He’s a great
leader on our football team.”

“Marvin’s a great quarterback,”
Pitt linebacker Charles Williams
said. “Last year he wasn't that
good of a passer, but nowl think
that he’s a better thrower than a
runner.”

Despite poor pass protection,
G raves completed 20 of 25 passes
for 295 yards and a touchdown
last week. He is the top-ranked

passer in the Big East and seventh-

best in the nation. For the year,
Graves has connected on 65

/

Heisman Trophy candidate, with
endless comparisons to his
brother, “the Rocket.” He took
the nation by storm with
performances against Florida and
Florida State on national
television. In his first two seasons,
“the Missile" only gained attention
for his kick—returning abilities and
often had problems catching the
football. This year he has finally
blossomed into the threat that
many thought his world-class
speed would bring the Orange.

California vs. Washington: War for the Roses

The defense will be without
linebacker Jo Jo Wooden, who
suffered a torn knee ligament last
week, which leaves the Orange
thin at this spot, considering Dan
Conley is already gone for the
year. Glenn Young and John
Lusardi have taken up the slack,
with’ 70 and 60 tackles
respectively. Intense noseguard
Kevin Mitchell is light _at 245
pounds but plays a ferocious
brand of football that fires up his
teammates. He has five tackles
for loss and three sacks already.

The Pitt offense has been erratic
all year — sometimes looking
like the Steelers, other times
mixing the run and pass to
perfection". Tailback Curtis Martin
is out with a toe injury, so the
load falls back into the hands of
Jermaine Williams as long as he
can hold on to the ball. Alex Van
Pelt threw 15 times to tight ends
last week, and that may not be
such a bad thang. Dave Moore
and Eric Seaman have the best
bands on the team, and used
with the play-action game they
can be tremendous. If Pitt can
run the ball effectively and play-
pass to the big guys and backs
out of the backfield, the.Panthers
should be able to mix things up
and go deep, hopefully burnin’
the Orange with the homerun.

On defense, Paul Hackett
yanked a majority of the starters
out “of the game in the fourth
quarter last week, so there is
some consolation in the Irish’s
late bombardment. The ‘Cuse are
a speed team, so Pitt will have to
contain Graves and stop the big
play to the wideouts. Look for
Fred von Appen’s D to throw a
lotof formations atthesophomore
QB and stack the front in an
attempt to stop the run. This will
force_Graves to throw, in which
case the Orange will be looking
deep, and Pitt can defend the big
play. If Walker runs at will, it
could get ugly.

In what has to be the biggest
Big East football game yet, look
for another close contest at home
for the Panthers. Were rootin’
like hell for the Panthers, but
we’ve missed three straight with
the blue and gold, so were going
with ‘Syracuse. Were puttin’
ourselves in a no—win situation.

Take Syracuse -2.

Hollands’ consistency has

‘become the “glue” that is holding

the Panther volleyball team

determined to go all out to win.

“Right now I’m playing really

playing steady all around.” Her
consistent play has helped the
often-injured ' Panthers
tremendously over the past two
years. ’

Hollands, a senior, has given

Hollands said. “I saw an
opportunity that I couldn’t pass
by.”

Coming to Pitt, Hollands
worked hard to improve her
game. She gave it her best effort
every practice. Her hard work
started to pay off last year.

Used like an NBA “sixth man”,
Pitt head coach Sue Woodstra
effectively subbed Hollands into
every match lastyear. “[Hollandsl
could come off the bench at any
position,” Woodstra said of
Hollands’ versatility. Hollands
played brilliantly when starter
Ann Marie Lucanie went down
with a mid—season ankle injury.

Hollands, better known for her
defensive play, did not let anyone
down. She tallied 400 digs in her
sophomore and junior years. Her
consistent subbing and defensive
wizardry promoted her to the
startinglineup this season.

Being very versatile, Hollands
can play anywhere on the court
and she has. Over the past three
years Hollands has played on the
rightside, the leftside, the middle
and even set occasionally. This
year she is starting on the right

couple plays at a time, Womack’s «

impact cannot be underestimated.
In Syracuse’s 45-21 upset of
Florida, Womack repeatedly ran
for key yardage, racking up first
downs, chewing up the clock
and even scoring a touchdown
himself. He averages close to five
yards per carry.

“He's an excellent runner,”
Hackett said of Womack. “They
have a couple loll Qks they rotate,

’ constantly putting pressure on

you running the football. They’re
much more comfortable with
Graves, a much differentsituation
from a year ago.”

Syracuse’s front wall isn’t
particularly big or strong, but it
features quick and athletic

linemen, who suit this attack well. 
Their leader is junior guard
Terrance Wisdom (6-4, 294), who
Hackett described as “one of the
class offensive linemen in the
conference.

“They have not been an
overpowering offensive line, but
they have been adequate,”
Hackett said. “They’re not this .
huge mass that comes forward
and Cf‘LlSh€S you, but they’re better
athletes, more skillful and tailored
to their philosophy.”

For Pitt to enjoy any success,
first they must stop the run. The
option attack includes three
aspects: the dive, the quarterback
keeper and the pitch. Stopping
the dive will depend greatly on
inside linebackers Williams and

Tom Tumulty and their ability to 

recognize and read the offensive
patterns.‘

“If everyone does their
assignments, then we'll do OK,”
Williams said. “Anytime you face
Syracuse, you have to look at an
athletic quarterback. We need to
distinguish the blocking scheme,
stop the dive and the option.” 1;-

performer and an excellent blocker," Woodstra said. “She has
good technique in all of her skills.”

Hollands’ play has started to rub off on the rest of the Panther
squad, a team Hollands knows is special. “I feel very close to
my teammates,” Hollands said. “We have been through a lot of
things together.” These past experiences have shown that this
is a team rich in talent but needy in a Ho11ands—type consistency
to be outstanding. '

1 Recently Pitt has turned its season around by winning its last
five matches to boost its record to 11-5. But Hollands said she
feels Pitt’s future lies on Oct. 23, the date the Panthers take on
Penn State. “If we beat Penn State, it would be a real turning
point in our season,” Hollands said. “We haven’t beaten them
since I’ve been [at Pittl.”

Beating the Nittany Lions would hurl Pitt back into the Top
20. However key matches against Syracuse and Georgetown
should not be overlooked. Those matches will enable Pitt to
win the Big East title, which Hollands said she also wants.

“Winning the Big East title for the fourth straight year would
be the icing on the cake for me,” Hollands said. “It would be
like a streak I would always remember.”

Bonds more than just a bat

By Brian Hultman
For T be Pitt News

- Say what you will about Barry
Bonds’ failure at the plate this
series, butl refuse to jump on the
bandwagon. His two spectacular
catches Sunday night prevented
the Braves from winning that
game in regulation. His speed
has also enabled him to steal
three bases so far and be perhaps
the only player on the field that
could have legged out his inﬁeld
hit in Game 4. His bat has yet to
make a difference, but he has.

spent the off-season working with

a ballet instructor in order to’

improve both his flexibilityand

College

Continued from page P-4
mugs are ridin’ their jock. The
Huskies come in ranked No. 3 in
the nation and on a roll after
thrashing Toledo last week 48-0.
The Huskies beat you with
defense. Tackle Steve Emtman is
the man (only a junior), and the
man deserves major Heisman

a respect. _If ever a defensive player

since Hugh Green deserves the
award, it is Emtman. But since
the Heisman is becoming more
of a joke every year, forget it. By
the way, this D hasn’t given up a
TD in 13 quarters.

On offense, wideout Mario
Bailey is one of the nation’s best
and last week caught three TD
passes from Billy Joe Hobert to
become Washington’s all—time
leader in career TD receptions.
Beno Bryant controls the ground
game and is always a threat to
bust the big one at any time
behind the massive ‘Huskie
offensive line, which is led by
tackle Lincoln Kennedy. The
Huskies can basically clinch the
Rose Bowl with a V here; the

only other test for Don" James’
troops is a Nov. 9 date at So. Cal.
Cake.

Cal is the surprise of the nation,
and with the recent signing of
Jason Kidd, the top schoolboy
hoopster in the land, the Bears
will be prime-time in b—ball soon,
too. Russell White is without
question the best running back in
the nation. Despite illness and
various injuries, White has rushed

for 507 yards and seven
touchdowns. All that said, a strong
showing against the Huskie brick
wall that allows slightly over 30
yards per contest could end the
Heisman debate and bring the
trophy to Berkely.

Quarterback Mike Pawlawski
is ranked sixth in the nation in
passing efficiency and has quickly
emerged as an All-American
candidate while outplayin g more-

publicized signal—callers such as
UCLA's Tommy Maddox.
Pawlawski completed 27 of 39
passes for 292 yards in leading
Cal to a 27-24 upset at UCLA two
weeks ago. That game put the
Bears on the map. Last week
Pawlawski fired two more TDs
while leading Cal to a 45-7
thrashing of Oregon. Sophomore
walk—on kicker Doug Brien won
the UCLA game with a_47—yard

field goal in the ﬁnal 30 seconds
and also beat Arizona with a boot
in the last minute. , ,
Cal comes in ranked seventh
and also knows that a win ensures
Pasadena and the smell of roses,
but Washington’s defense is just
too tough. It’s a lot of points, but
we’re 4-0 in games involving the

Pac 10, and we need a win. .

Blowout, baby.
Take Washington -13.

THE PITT NEWS, Saturday, October 19, 1991 _

 

'Pitt’s men’s swim team, which

‘ __won its ninth straight Big East

Championship last March, has

I great potential —the potential to

gain national prominence and
the potential for disappointment.

Last year the Panthers began
the season with no seniors or
proven leaders on the team. They
responded to the challenge by
having every swimmer contribute
to its victories.

“We had to pull ourselves up
by our bootstraps because we
had no studs to carry the team,“

assistant coach Mark Davin said.
“Last year the guys realized that it
was up to them.“

Instead of rifling four or five
“studs“ at an opponent to
dominate certain events and
garner enough points to win the
meet, Pitt used its overall team
depth as the key to its success.
The result of head coach Chuck
Knoles‘ strategy was creating a
team with many swimmers on
the brink of becoming “studs“
themselves.

“There is a lot of responsibility
that goes with the next level,‘‘
said Knoles, last year’s Big East
coach of the year. “It takes harder

work, more training and more
concentration.“

“They have to ask themselves,
‘Do. I really want to be a national-
class athlete, or was last year as
far as I want to go?“‘ Davin said.

What will make it tough for the
Panthers to capture a 10th Big
East title will be the addition of
Miami and the overall
improvement of the,other teams
in the conference. Suddenly the
Big East ismaking waves on the
national swimming scene, and
Knoles wants Pitt to be right
there in front.

Villanova outrecruited Pitt by

snaring three senior, national-
qualifying first-year students to
Pitt’s one. This makes the Wildcat
squad even more dangerous than
last year’s squad, which pressed
Pittuniil the end of the conference
championship meet.

“I start having nightmares when
I think about the Big East
Championships,” Knoles said.

Miami is just plain good. The
sprint events have always been
one of Pitt's’ greatest strengths,
but the Hurricanes have many
swimmers just as fast. In diving,
an event that Pitt has dominated

in the past few years, the team

" StajfW'r1'ter

will have its hands full with a
Hurricane team that includes the
national collegiate champion.

Syracuse is another vastly
improved team that is looking to
dethrone Pitt from the top of the
conference.

“I’m sure Syracuse isn’twalking

around with a very good taste in
their mouth after what happened
at the Big East Championships,“
Knoles said. “They waxed our
bottoms pretty good in a dual
meet earlier in the season, and
then we embarrassed them by
100 points in the championship.
They are going to want to hit us
with everything they got.“
Despite the tough road ahead
for Pitt, the swimmers are pretty
confident. Joe Kozlina and Don
Boyd, who both qualified for the
Olympic Trials, return. So does
the school-record holder in the
50-free, Eric Cornell. Pitt's top
newcomer is Matt.Brady, who

‘also qualified for the Olympic

Trials but must qualify again due
to a rules change in the
backstroke. But it may be this
dose of confidence that will be
Knoles’ biggest problem.

“This is probably one of the
cockiest teams I have ever seen
at any university,“ he said. “If

. they are going to walk around

that cocky, they are going to have
to swim damn fast. There isn’t
anyone in the Big East that is
going to hold the door open for
them. They’ll slam it right in their
face.“

‘The Missile’ to land in

By Brandy L. Simms
Staff Writer

A year ago Raghib “Rocket”
Ismail was wreaking havoc on
opposing teams. He was a coach’s
worst nightmare. :-

Now that the “Rocket” toils up
north in the Canadian Football
League, little brother Qadry
(pronou nced KAH-dree) has been
handed the torch. And he’s
running toward the Syracuse
record book.

Said Pitt coach Paul Hackett:
“They got [Ismail] in an offensive
position where every time he’s a
threat to go all the way —— every

lineman out of high school but
has responded at the nose.

The Syracuse secondary is
perhaps the most questionable
part of the Orangemen’s defense.
It has given up an average of 269
yards a game passing. It has a
total o-f five interceptions on the
year, four fewer than the Pitt
secondary.

“They play tough defense, and
they will be fired up for this
game,” I-Iackett said. “We always
have a tough time with Syracuse,
and they’re coming off two tough
losses to Florida State and East
Carolina. If we don’t watch out,
we can go into East Carolina with
a two-game losing streak.”

philosophy that has rung true for
the Panthers this season and has
been heard by other players: The
team comes first.

“I just lead by my actions and
work and play hard every game,
“ Christy said. “I don’t talk a lot or
preach to the other guys. I just
stick to my. game and work to
make this team successful.”

When the Panthers take the
field on Saturday against Syracuse,
Christy will be hard at work to
impress the homecoming crowd,
and turn the offense around.
Christy said the ‘offense is not
getting the job done at this point.

“We have really been struggling
for the past few weeks, and last
week at Notre Dame we self-
destructed,” Christy said. “We
have to get moving, and we must
come together and bounce back.
It’s not going to be easy against
[the Orangemanl, but we all have
our responsibilities, and we’ve
seen them before, so we'll be all
right.”

time he touches the ball.’’

In last week’s three-point loss’
to East Carolina, the “Missile”
caught six passes for 101 yards.
He’s quickly blossoming into one
of the nation’s premier receivers.
Ismail ranks fourth in the Big East
in receiving. In six games, the 6-
foot, 192-pound junior from
Wilkes—Barre, Pa., has caught 24
passes for 509 yards and three
touchdowns. He's averaging 21.2
yards per catch and four catches
per game. _

“Oh, certainly Qadry has had a
very productive year,” Syracuse
Coach Paul Pasqualoni said,
“although he did drop a pass ,

interception that really hurt.”

“I think for the most part Qadry
ca me out of the blocks and caught
the first pass of the year in ’91 as
opposed to [when he] in 1990
dropped the first pass of the
year,” Pasqualoni added.

As a kickoff returnman Ismail
is no slouch either. In Syracuse’s
/16-1/I loss to top-ranked Florida
State two weeks ago, he returned
a kickoff 95 yards for a
touchdown. He’s forced kickers
to resort to high, short kickoffs in
an effort to keep the ball out of
his hands. 2 '

accounted for both Orangemen
scores. The other came on a 44-
yard touchdown reception. He
leads the Big East in all-purpose
yards with 935. Already he has
been mentioned as a Heisman
Trophy candidate. Ismail has also
had to deal with comparisons to
big brother Raghib. However he
hasn’t let these distractions get in
his way.

“I think he’s handled it very

well,” Pasqualoni said. “I think’
that he’s very, very realistic in the ‘J ,
fact that the season is just now 0 ‘

half over, and we’re heading into
the second"half of our season.
