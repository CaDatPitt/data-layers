Pitt Chancellor Wesley‘ Posvar
served as a “personal intermediary"
between the Central Intelligence
Agency and leading members of the
academic community in arranging
meetings between the two groups in
I978, The Pitt News has learned.

The communications between
Posvar and then CIA Director
Admiral Stansfield Turner regard-
ing contact of university presidents
to set up discussions with the CIA
were revealed in 24 documents
obtained in November, ‘I980, by the
Center for National Security Studies
through litigation. under the Free-
dom of Information Act, copies of
which were sent to The Pitt News.

In addition, the documents reveal
specific schedulesofa June 14, 1978
meeting between selectedimembers
of the academic community and the
CIA, a series of correspondences
between former University of Michi-
gan President Robben Fleming and
Turner where Turner voices his
objections to university guidelines
governing CIA recruitment on cam-
pus, and various letters of invitation
and interdepartmental memos of the
CIA in reference to the meetings
with the academic epmmunity.

of seminars to improve the com-
munications between the agency and
the academic community by inviting
university presidents to CIA head-
quarters in Langley, Va. for the day-
long briefings and seminars.
University-CIA relations, clandes-
tine activities on campus and

' research were discussed at the meet-

ings, in addition to improving the
overall understanding of the intelli-
gence community with academic
institutions.

“It was a series of briefings to tell

educators about the organization,

about its mission and about its
experts,“ said Posvar who attended
one of the briefings.

Posvar‘s involvement in the
briefings outside of his attendance is
detailed in an April 6, I978 letter

. sent to Turner, where Posvar offered

to act a “personal intermediary with
his peers, so that when letters of
invitation are recieved from you
they would be inclined to make an
ajfirmative response. ” -
Posvar said in an interview
Thursday with The Pitt News
that Turner discussed with him “his .
desire to open up the CIA to more
public contact, to open it up to the
academic community, and so I
advised him as the letters show in
suggesting people to be invited, and
he did invite some’ people that I
suggested plus some other people.”

1978, Pos var expresses his
"interest in Turner’s
attempts to draw the
academic community and
the CIA closer together.
In the second paragraph,
Posvar outlines “two

possible phases ’ ’ in
achieving con tact with
university presidents, and
then Posvar suggests
himself as someone who
could “act as a personal
-intermediary with his
peers. ” .

Farther in the April 6
letter, Posvar informs
Turner he will be
attending a meeting of the
Association of A merican
Universities in two weeks
at Stanford Um'versi'ty,_
where he can make the
necessary contacts.

with “this course of

According to a handwritten and
signed note on an internal “routing
and record sheet,” King telephoned
Posvar to “procede as indicated"
Saturday afternoon, April IS, I978.

The interdepartmental memo,
which also recommended holding
off inviting Posvar to a formal
meeting until we know how his own
project is faring, " was approved by
Turner on April I5, I978. I

After attending the meeting of the
Association of American
Universities‘ in Palo Alto,
California, Posvar sent an April 27,
I978 letter to Turner listing the
university presidents he spoke with
in regards. to improving relations
between the academic community
and the CIA.

According to Posvar‘s letter, the
persons he contacted were: Thomas
Bartlett, President, Association of
American Universities; Robben
Fleming, President, Michigan;

. Sheldon Hackney, President,

Tulane; Charles LeMaistre,
Chancellor, Texas; Steven Muller,
President, John Hopkins; Robert
Parks, President, Iowa State; Jack

‘PeItason, President, American

Council on Education; Terry
Sanford," President, Duke; John
Sawhill, President, NYU; David
Saxon, President, California; and
Robert Sproull, President,
Rochester. V

“They represent some degree of
disrribution geographically and by
type of institution, and each one of
them is an outstanding individual, "
Posvalr wrote to Turner in the letter.

In the interview with the Pitt
News Thursday, Posvar said he
“vaguely” recalled discussing with
his collegues listed in the April 27
letter’.-the “desirability of they’re

possibly being interested in receiving _

such a briefing and such a visit”with
the CIA.

, In the fifth paragraph ofthe letter,
Posvar recommended to Turner that

each of the university presidents and '

himself be invited to “spend a day
with you and the Agency "to discuss
academic-C IA relations,

However, in that same paragraph
Posvar suggested to Turner that any
letter of invitation to the university
presidents should not include
Posvar’s name:-“I suggest you leave
my name out of your letter of
invitation; while. I did make the
initial inquiry, I want to avoid any

impression that this is anything,

other than your own program, in

which I am one of the equal

participants," Posvar wrote.

In response »to a question
concerning this suggestion to Tu rnér
that h.is name be left out ofany Ie-tter
of invitation, Posvar told the Pitt
News that he “didn’t want this to
appear ‘to be anything’ but his
(Turner's) own idea. and his own
initiative which it really was.:I didn’t
want to—I thought it would have
been very unsuitable for me to
be...taking an initiative in this area‘.
It was his idea," Posvar said.

The next step in setting upithei

June I4, I978 meeting between the

CIA and the university presidents is--
‘contained in an interdepartmental I

memorandum from Brian Lajell
who was the acting coordinator for,
academic relations and _ external

In the memo. Latell recom-‘

on Education and the Association of

‘.5 Turner "indicate. . . concurrence " to

proposals for arranging a second
university presidents meeting.
(According to the memo and in a
May I I, I978 letter from Turner to
Posvar. the ‘first meeting of this
l<ind"had been held March I0, I978.
The meeting was “quite rewarding

for all concerned, "Turner wrote to

Posvar.
After the May I I, I978 letterfrom
Turner to Posvar, Posvar‘s

involvement in arranging the
meeting is not recorded in any ofthe

Qflater CIA documents from the May

K9

II Turner letter to a July I7, I978
letter from Turner to President
Robben Fleming of the University
of Michigan.

In reporting his attendance at the
meeting with the CIA, Posvar made
two statements to the university
community regarding the meeting.
The first statement was made at the
Nov. I5, I978 meeting of Pitt's
board of trustees and the second
statement was made to the Senate

Council Dec. II, I978.
According to the chancellor’s
notes of the Nov. I5 trustee’s

meeting, Posvar explained to the
trustees that the purpose of the
meeting with the CIA was “tofoster
(a) mutually beneﬁcial relationship,
within and under present laws
governing (the) CIA and to raise
(the) general regard of educators for
our intelligence service as an
essential part of government,” and
to ‘facilitate (the) greatest possible
interaction between (our)
academic"/intelligence communi-
ties.”

And according to the minutes of
the Dec. ll, I978 Senate Council
meeting; “The Chancellor and'other
university presidents met for one
day with Admiral Turner, the new
head of CIA. He is interestedin
public perception of intelligence
activity. The meeting was open. The
CIA gathers enormous quantity of

mater1'a/‘which is available to the
public and not much used by
academics. " Posvar also reported at
the Senate Council meeting that the
university, “to the best of his
/(now/edge, "has no "secret research
projects, "according to the minutes.
“I reported to the University
Senate. which was reported in the
Times (University Times)...that I
had attended that meeting...there
was nothing else to say,“ Posvartold
the Pitt News.
“It was a series of briefings to tell
educators about the organization,
about its mission and about its
experts," Posvar said. “I think the
main point to be made is that it is
almost entirely a research
organization; people who read
books and manuscripts and articles
and study from nearly all open
sources of literature about foreign
countries and particularly about the
Soviet Union. And they write
reports and studies about this, most
of which, many of which are widely
dissemenated throughout the
country and are available in the
public domain. And his (Turner’s)
concern, which was very much in
keeping with the modernizing ofthe
agency and bringing it under closer
public scrutiny, was to open it up as
an intellectual resource, a place
where there’s a great deal of
scholarly activity going on which the
academic community ought to know
about and have access to.

“...the whole thing was a very
positive aspect of making the CIA a
more responsible and responsive
public institution,’_’ Posvar said.

“I think you should take into
account that ‘these people or you
have discovered nothing that wasn‘t
already in the public domain, and
that not only was’ it in the public
domain, but I took pains.to report it
to the entire university community
shortly after the meeting,” Posvar
added.

’ Q) What role had the CIA played on
this campus up until this meeting?
A) To my knowledge I know of no

role that the CIA played on this

..campus...the CIA as I understand it
recruits here along with other
government agencies every year.-
Q) What was your role in arranging
the‘ series of meetings? According to
the letters you played quite a part.
A) Well, I am a college friend of
Stansfield Turner. .I-Ie‘and I were at
Oxford University together in the
same college, and I hgd been his

friend for 35 years and he discussed -

with me his desire to open up the
CIA to more public contact, open it
up to the academic community. And
so I advised him as the Iettersshow
in suggesting people to be invited
and'he did invite some people that I
suggested plus some other people
and they attended. I think there had
been several such brieﬁngs and visits
by groups of university presidents.
For example, I believe President
Oswald (Penn State) was there, I
think he told me sometime during
the past year, for another oneof
these brieﬁngs. ’ 7‘

It was a series‘ of briefings to tell

' educators about. the organization,

about its mission, about its experts.

And l.think the main point to be _’

made is that it is 'almost’entirely a

foreign countries and particularly

about the Soviet‘ Union. And they.

write reports and studies about
these, most of which, many of which

are widelydissemenated throughout ‘

the country and" are availablegin the
public domain. And his concern,

which was very much in keeping,

with thegmodernizingvof the agency,
and bringing it under closer public
scrutiny, was to open it up as an
intellectual resource, a place where‘
there's a great deal of scholarly

activity going‘ on which the,

academic community ought to know
about and have access to.“

Q) What’ is the present state of-

University-CIA relations? _

The earliest artifacts of
toolmaking by primitive man were
discovered by an archaeologist on a
fellowship at Pitt. Dr. Jack Harris,
working on a one year Mellon Post-
doctoral Fellowship, found the
stone implements in Ethiopia in
1977.

Harris said the “stone implements
are considered the oldest excavated
occurrence of tool use or
toolmaking by about 500,00 years."

The artifacts date to 2.5,million
years ago. .

Although the oldest early man, or
hominid, remains are from 3 to 3.5
million years old, there is no
evidence yet that they could make
tools.

Harris explained that the
“concentration of stone artifacts and
broken up bone indicates a shift in
diet to include meat, and is the
earliest cultural evidence for stone
toolmaking and use. Stone
toolmaking may have acted to
influence a greater intellectual
capacity.”

While the University of
Pittsburgh is only a state-related
institution and not completely state-
owned, Leavey maintains that CAS
member schools can work with Pitt

“Administrators should work for
a bigger pie, instead of bigger pieces
of the same pie.”

In April, CAS will be sponsoring
a lobbing conference at which
student representatives from the I4

“So far, no hominid remains have
been found at the site.“ Harris said.
“it is very unusual to find both
hominid remains and tools
together.“

The discovery occurred at a site
called Hadar while Har_ris was part
of the International Afar Research
Expedition studying evidence of
early man in the Afar Depression in
northeastern Ethiopia.

The fellowship will enable Harris
to “complete some of the writing up
of archaeological evidence.”

Harris had been working at early
man sites in East Africa for the past
ten years.

He has no formal teaching
requirements in the Anthropology
Department, but has given seminars
in the department and helps
graduate students with references,
etc.

Harris chose Pitt because he had
worked with two Pitt paleon-
tologists—Drs. Craig Black and
Leonard l(ristalka—at the Lake
Turkana site in northern Kenya. Dr.
Black is also director ofthe Carnegie
Museum of Natural History.

Starting in March, Harris will
teach a six-week course at the
museum on human origins.

Harris Finds Early African Tools

Educated at the University of
California at Berkeley, he became
associated with Dr. Glynn Isaac.
Harris worked with Dr. Isaac and
l)l’. Richard Leakey. son of the late
L.S.B. Leakey, at Lake Turkana.

Harris said Pitt has “one of the
stroi1gest- programs in archaeology
in the eastern U.S., especially 
cultural resource management
studies, and in New World
archaeology."

Cultural resource management
includes saving archaeological sites
from being destroyed by
development. '

For students interested in
archaeology, Harris said “there is a
lot of scope for studies related to
early man....The problem is getting a
job—it‘s a real specialty and there
are few openings.”

While a paleontologist studies the
environment of early man, an
archaeologist studies the “activities
and behavior" of early man.

Most funding for expeditions
comes from the National Sciences
Foundation, within the federal’
government.

Private funds are received from
the L.S.B. Leakey Foundation,
National Geographic, and others.

The research by Harris in the Afar
Depression is a follow-up of work
undertaken by the French
archaeologist Dr. Helene Roche,
who discovered the first surface
artifacts which were dated to about
2.5 million years ago.

The Speech

By TIMOTHY P. MCCABE

Pitt News Staff Writer

‘‘I’m not a religious person. l’m
almost anti-religious. l think reli-
gion is the opiate of the people. I
think religion is men and women try-
ing to work their way to God
through good works and religious
ritualism. Christianity is no religion.
It's a relationship,” Josh McDowell
explained.

McDowell, an internationally

 

known Christian activist for Cam-
pus Crusade, pitched and fielded
questions during a lecture before
Prof. Trevor Melia’s “Rhetoric in a
Free Society" class in the David
Lawrence auditorium. The topic
was social solutions and problems to
them, with McDowell offering his
alternative solution.

His thesis was this: When we face
problems in society it is not enough
to change structures around individ-
uals without at the same time chang-
ing the individual who makes the
structures.

“l’ll challenge you to find the solu-
tion' to changing people from the
inside-out,” McDowell said.

Today’s thought wave, McDowell
said, is that if people know better
they will do better and therefore the
basic problem of ignorance can be
blotted out by education.

McDowell jumped to a scene in

asked “Tell me sir. what is the
answer?” J

“Education," the agent retorted.
“Education? Come on, look at my
country. One of the foremost edu-
cated countries in history. We’ve
had Martin Luther King, Robert
Kennedy, John Kennedy. An edu-
cated person has the same inward
desires for power, for prestige,
exploitation, thinking his skin color
is better than somebody else’s skin.
No amount of education will elimi-
nate that,” McDowell said, recalling
his conversation.

/

“After years of travel and study I

_am convinced that the natural state

of man is anarchy: every man for
himself," proclaimed McDowell.

The main reason people come
together in social groups is to save
themselves, McDowell argued. He
mentioned an environmentalist as
an example, whose main concern
would be to perpetuate his life and
the lives of his family.

When the floor opened for ques-
tions one man wanted to know why
McDowell spoke against racial and
other types of prejudices and yet
attempted to persuade people to his
religion. I

“My philosophy is I’ve got my life
to live and others got their own.
What people do with it is their own
responsibility,” McDowell returned.

Melia, a rhetorician, philosopher.

and teacher at Pitt, uses the free-
speaking world as a laboratory for
studying persuasion. He has
watched people being “saved” while
playing the piano at a mission in the
Yukon. He has dropped in on cultic
tent meetings in the Bahamas. In
short, he’s seen some ofthe best and
some of the worst persuaders, both
secular and religious.

“McDowell is a fine example ofa
major persuasive group in our
society,” Melia said of his rhetorical
specimen.

McDowell’s rhetoric is

V characterized by two suppositions:

one, we live in an unsatisfactory time
and- two, whatever problems exist,

  
   

Dr. Melia discusses McDowell’s
rhetorical style. Gallagher Photo

we now have the solution.

“It doesn’t matter if. you’re a
communist or a Christian or the
Ayatollah -Khom_ieni, tharmessage
works," Melia said. “Most people
feel we are in very troubled times."

According to Melia there has been
a change in McDowell since his visit
here seven years ago when his basic
message to students was, “I
understand having long hair,
wearing jeans and being close to
Vietnam.” The change, said Melia,
was a change in the attitudes of the
audience.

“At the end of 20 miniutes,”-Melia

explained, “you knew he's been
listened to all over the world, that

he’; written ‘books, that he’s been in _

exciting situa.tions,~running from
spears in the jungle, and he’s not
above making allusions to sex. To
sum it up, he’s a marvel man, which
is a very good move vis a vis the

audience he’s talking to.” .
Melia said that out of all the

people who heard McDowell speak,

_ those who were persuaded believed

theyiwere persuaded because of
truth, while those who weren’t

- persuaded were "convinced thatwthe

Mentality  

The Reagan administrations move to escalate aid to the
ruling El Salvador military “civilian" junta shows all the
signs of passingvirtually unscathed. About $10 million of
the $73.5 million earmarked for the war-ravaged country is
military assistance. This renewed show of support by the
United States can only serve to heighten the atrocities taking
place in this Third World country.

The United States has nothing economic at stake in El
Salvador. The country, therefore, has bccomeawjilioving
ground for the new administration’s show of “firmness” on
thwarting’ the spread of communism.

What the State Department so obligingly accepts as fact
and what is actually taking place in El Salvador seem to be
two different things. The blood-bath’ techniques of the
military in El Salvadorare leaving tens of thousands of
people in that country either dead or homeless. The
mutilation of victims is the calling card of the junta, whose
forces seem to be operating within an undirected, vigilante

’ framework. With an increase of military hardware, the
United States is adding fuel to this fire that has long since
run out of control. ‘

The reasoning of the State Department is clear as well as
disturbing. In a_ Feb. l7 briefing to representatives of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Secretary of State

Alexander Haig outlined the U.S. position in relationito this
“well-orchestrated international communist campaign.”
Further on in the briefing, Haig went on to say that “we will
not remain passive in the face of this communist challenge, a
systematic, well-ﬁnanced, sophisticated effort to impose a
communist regime in Central America.” ‘

Although the State Department hastens to downplay the
-recurring image of another Vietnam, the entire policy
rationale smacks of the same ‘philosophies that dragged us
into Indochina. Operating under a hopelessly naive Cold
War mentality, the U.S. is turning El Salvador into a stage
for the full-scale theatrics of the East-Westxconﬂict. The
volatile potential of these developments is frightening. El
Salvador is not the place for the U.S. to ﬂex its muscles.

The escalation of aid is getting some opposition on the
homefront. House members Barbara McCulsky, Jerry \
Studs and Robert Edgars went to Central America to report

on the El Salvador refugee situation. Thev were briefed on _
their departure that they wouldiencounter about lQ,000\
refugees, driven from their homes “by both military and
guerrilla forces. What they found onarfival, however,'was-
about 25,000 refugees all driven out by the military junta.
There were no figures on the number of Salvadorans
missing, tortured or murdered by the right-wing “death
squads,” as the“ people in that country refer to their
disjointed government forces’.

These representatives, on their return, then introduced
House Bill No._ 1509, which calls for a stop to military aid to
El Salvador. At present, support for this bill in the House
has reached 25. But the possibility of aid cutoff looks bleak.

' The intentions of the State Department concerning this
Central American situation are too dangerous‘ to be
acceptable.‘ The departmentls domino-effect reasoning is
enough‘. to condemn its policy,«but the inevitable increase in
human slaughter makes it imperativethatthe U.S., so often

How often do you hear someone
say, “Well, that’s Greek to me”? To
approximately 450 young women at
the University of Pittsburgh, this
statement carries a lot of weight.

Why did they get involved in Pitt's
sorority system?

That question receives a variety of
answers. Some girls say that they
were “pushed' into it by friends or
relatives. Others cite their curiosity
and search for friendship, while still
others come to Pitt with the inten-
tion ofseekingout the sorority which
‘is right for them. On the‘ whole, Pitt
women who have become involved
in the Greek system find it to be a
rewarding and enriching experience,
an opportunity for‘ sharing good
times t‘ and bad times with close

friends, and a chance to exercise
lttidership and responsibility. They
find that the more they contribute to
ll"lC system, the more they will
receive in return.

The next question is usually,
“How do I learn more about Pitt‘s
sororities?”

This is where the explanation can
become complicated. How many
times have you heard the words:
rush, bid, ribboning, pledge, prefer-
ence cards, and Panhel? Is it all
“Greek” to you? Rush is the time for

‘interested Pitt women to become
acquainted with the Greek system
on campus, and with its individual
sororities and members. Formal
rush in September consists of four
distinct “rounds” of parties over a
two-week period where the
“rushees_” are given the opportunity
to visit each sorority and narrow

‘their preferences gradually. At the

close of this period, a rushee may
choose a sorority that she would like
to join by filling out a preferernce
card. No rushee is ever under any
obligation to join a-sorority if she
desires not to do so. Many girls
decide to go through formal rush

9"l.V to meet new people, with no
intention of pledging.

This brings us back to the deﬁni-
ll0n of pledging.” As a rushee is
filling out her preference card, each
sorority is simultaneously issuing
bids to the girls they would like to
have join their respective sorority;
These “bids” are invitatio_ns to join j
the sorority. If the rushee’s prefer-
ence card should match a sorority’s'
bid, she is eligible to be “ribboned”
as‘ a pledge” to that sorority. Her .
period of pledgeship is a time of _
training to learn‘ the history, tradi- -
tions and goals of the group. This
entire rush system is coordinated by ' 
the"University of Pittsburgh Panhel-.; if 
lenic Association which is the‘. '.j'"37'
governing body of I Pitt’s sororities. T

say, “That’s Greek to me!” .  ’

C It seemed like the 80’s would be
different. After the activism‘ of the
sixties, the “personal growth” of the
early seventies, and the dubious title
of the “me generation,” it seemed the
decade of the 80's would be one of
moderation. ' _ _

The United‘States has a recurring
pattern of extremes in dealing with
everything from politics to family

' life. In a few short years, Russia was
our enemy rather than an ally and
China was our friend. Taiwan was
disowned and Red China‘ embraced.
Parents no longer “owned” their
-children and corporal punishment
was the last resort of incompetent
parents. Democratic administra-
tions are replaced by a Republican
one,,which is in turn replaced by-
another democratic reign.

It is perhaps a result of having
information provided for us at the
turn ofa knob, having issues deﬁned «
for usjn encapsulated analyses and '
nightly “briefs” and recaps, that;
have led us to this “either-: r”‘way off

          

  

"25

But to blame the mediaor any
other system, institution, or person
as the sole cause of anything,
particularly an entire approach to
issues‘ is to demonstrate t_his “one or
the other" mentality.

The media provides information
for analysis by its readers or viewers.
It is the ‘responsibility of those
readers and viewers to do their own
analyses of the information
provided. This is one of the basic
assumptions central to the concept
of democracy. E

Americans in the 80's are
supposed to be better. educated,
better informed, and more socially
conscious than ever before. But
indications prove otherwise.

A Once again Americans are
complaining about the policies of a
new presidentia'l administration.
The old “throw out the old _and bring
in the new” prevailed in the last"
election — withga note _of near’

despair. This landslide. was not even i I

1  irhe ‘Pitt  23; 1981

By MIKE DICHIARA

Pitt News Sports Writer

The West_Virginia Mountaineers
(18-6) entered the Pitt Field House
Saturday night with two of the most
highly-touted guards in the East in
Greg Jones and Quentin Freeman,
according to most coaches in the
Eastern Eight. But Panther guards
Dwayne Wallace and Carlton
Neverson outshined their
counterparts in leading the Panthers

/(I4-10) to.a 81-64 humiliation of the
league's previously first-place team
before a sell-out crowd of 6,360.

Pitt began the contest quickly as
Wallace opened the scoring with two
23-foot jumpers. Pitt extended its
lead to five, (9-4), before trouble set
in. Wallace picked up his second and
third personal fouls within eight
seconds and had to sit out for the
remaining 12 minutes of the first
half. —

“The key for us was when we lost
Dwayne," said Pitt coach Roy
Chipman. “They (WVU) came back
and got back in the ballgame. Giss
(Darrell Gissendanner) and (Dave)
Olinger came in and did a great job
of" keeping us close.”

When Wallace left the game, the
Pitt offense seemed to sputter as
West Virginia took its first lead of
the night, 19-17, with 7:31 remaining
in the half. The Panthers were just
not playing good basketball at this
point, shooting only 26 percent from

the floor and 43 percent from the
foul line.

“We were not playing well," said
Chipman, “and key people were out,
but we tried to use that positively
because we were only down by four
at the half.

“Silently, Dwayne Wallace is
playing great basketball, making
very few mistakes and running the
offense——he is the key for us,” added
Chipman.

Wallace started the second half
and scored Pitt’s first six points of
the half on a 17-foot jumper, two
free throws and a lay—up. Neverson
started pumping in his own shots
and Wallace followed with six more
straight points. Pitt regained the
lead after five minutes of play, 39-36.

‘“He’s (Wallace) in charge out
there. (Sam) Clancy is the
policeman, Dog (“Hotdog"~
Wallace’s nickname) is the
.quarterback,” Chipman said.
“Neverson is on a hot streak—we
need that from Carlton. It’s a good
time to be hot.”

Overall, Wallace finished the
game with 21 points—l6 in the
second half, and Neverson finished
with a game-high 25 points—l7 in
the second half. _

“We've been playing just as well,”
said Neverson, referring to WVU’s
starting guards, “so we had
something to prove tonight.”

  Pitt Whips WVU, 81-64, Before Sellout Crowd

Sam Clancy was a one-man wrecking crewagainst West Virginia, outmuscliiig West Virgina for

15 rebounds.

While Wallace and Neverson were
leading the team in scoring, Sam
Clancy and Lennie McMillian were
taking charge underneath the
basket. Clancy hauled in a game-
high 15 rebounds and McMillian
pulled down 13 more to sustain
Pitt's inside strength.

“It was too tough,” said Clancy
about the play under the basket. “It
was more physical than 1 expected.
They kept beating on us and we kept

beating on them.”

In a game that had some added‘

emotion, being senior appreciation
night, Clancy alsomuscled his way
to score 16 points in the Panthers
most balanced scoring attack of the
year, McMillian also chipped in 15
points, 11 of which came in the
second half.

“We were more aggressive than»

we were in West Virginia," ‘said
Chipman. “Of course the crowd

helped but, nonetheless, we were"
more aggressive."

The’ win keeps Pitt in the battle for
advantage in the preliminary round
of the Eastern Eight playoffs, with a
7-4 mark. Pitt must win its final two
regular season games this week,
against Massachusetts on Tuesday
and Rutgers on Saturday, to clinch
the homecourt spot. Rutgers, 6-5 in
league action, must still meet

Ilauquesne this week before playing

Season Strong g

Pitt News Sports Writer

The Pitt men's swim team
wrapped up this year’s regular
season with two more wins to bring
their season standing to 9-2. For
seniors Pat Greenwell, Stu
Swanson, Chris Butts, and Jeff
Trew, these victories capped a four-
year personal record of 35-3, to
sweeten their graduation.

Pitt defeated Cleveland State
University 62-49 in a rather easy
match for the Panthers. Pitt’s Rick
Carter took two wins in the 50 and
100 yard freestyle events with only
one CSU swimmer coming close.
Freshman breast-stroker John
Waldman swam in Pitt’s winning
400 medley relay as well as
individually destroying the CSU
breast-strokers in the 200 by ten full
seconds. Geoff Emore, also a
freshman, made a similar showing in
the backstroke portion of Pitt‘s
winning 400 medley relay. Emore
also touched six seconds before the
nearest Cleveland State swimmer to
win the 200-yard backstroke.

The Panthers showed their team
depth in the‘200-yard freestyle as
Scott Shearer took first, Sandy
Pidgeon second, and Mike Lehto
third. All three swam under 1:50, the
fourth-place Cleveland State time,
with Shearer and Pidgeon both

Seniors End

By SEAN BARNES
Pitt News Sports Writer
Eastern 'men’s' swimming
championships will be dominated
again this year by the powerful
Panthers who are seeded first in
seven of eleven Eastern events. The
depth and strength of ‘Pitt’s swim
team gives the Panthers an excellent
chance of claiming their sixth
consecutive Eastern Championship
title, and the third for Pitt coach
Fred Lewis. - .
The_ Panthers have gotten
stronger each year under Lewis,
thanks to senior standouts such as
the team’s No. 1 backstroker‘. Stu
Swanson,’Chris Butts, an Eastern
qualifier in the 200'butterﬂy, and the
1978 Eastern _500 freestyle champ
and current 500 freestyle team-
record holder, ileff Trew.
With Lewis counting on'a good
recruiting year to complement his
remaining team,‘ the graduations

. should not put the dent in the team it
might have. Next year’s team will be '

potent, with strength inevery event.
Of the returning men on next year’s
team, ‘ Sandy Pidgeon, Scott
Shearer, and Rick Carter should

V lead the pack. ‘

Pidgeon is the reigning 1980
Eastern champion in the 200
breaststroke, and holds the team

record in the 200 breast and the 400
intermediate, as well; He is also the
fastest on _i the team in the 200
intermediate and the 200
breaststroke, and he ratessecond in

the 1000 and 500 freestyle and_200 5'

be felt if you stand near him before
his event. Without saying a thing,
you realize he believes he is going to
win. This season, Pidgeon scored 75
individual points, which gives him
the team lead in individual scoring.

.Pidgeon‘s versatility and power

shows throught best in his
intermediate events.

Pidgeon’s turns after the
backstroke and into the breastroke
usually decide the race as he pulls

‘away by not just tenths of seconds,

but by complete body lengths. And
just when you think you’ve seen it
all, Pidgeon turns out freestyle like it
was the first lap and not the
thirteenth.-‘P His endurance and‘
excellent swimming typifies the
entire Pitt team’s dedication to the
sport. .
Another standout is junior
‘freestyler Scott Shearer. Shearer,

who led the 400 freestyle relay team .

to the Eastern Championship last
year, will be going for it again this
year. Shearer also has the team’s 200
freestyle record, and will swim it also
at Eastern’s where he is seeded first.
He is Pitt's second-fastest 100-yard
freestyler '1 and third—best at the

With the help of the seniors, all of
whom contributed something to the
game, the Panthers pulled out an_
emotional 81-64 win. It could have
gone no other way, as the seniors, in
front of their paren-ts, rose to the
occasion for what may be their last
time at Fitzgerald Fieldhouse.

It all began with pre-game cerem-
onies where seniors Ed 'Scheuer-
mann, Dave Olinger, Lennie
McMillian, Carlton Neverson, and
Sam Clancy all presented a corsage
to their mothers and were presented
with a plaque. It wastruly an emo-

running, stop talking and stop try-

_all scorers and his defense was, as
always, brilliant.

“There was a lot of emotion out

-there with our parents here. Wejust

had to win. This had to be one ofthe
top’ two or three games of my
career," Neverson said.

McMillian, a transfer from Geor-
gia, is the defensive specialist on the
team; At 6‘4”, he is small for a for-
ward, but his rebounding is surpris-
ingly strong as evidenced by his l3
boards against WVU. But it is his
defense that has made McMillian so
valuable. - His quick hands have
made him a menace on defense, and
his ability on the fastbreak is not too
shabby either. -

“This was a big game for me. My
mom was here and I wanted to show
here that l was playing good,” an
ebullent McMillian said.

Olinger and Scheuermann, both V

Pitt Seniors Go Out Winners

have not seen much action this year,
but against WVU they made valua-
ble contributions. Olinger, a shooter
par excellence, came in to provide
smart play in the backcourt. Though
not a player with great physical
attributes, Olinger always made up
for it with smart play and that shoot-
ing ability. Although this has been a
tough season for the senior, Olinger
has come through when called upon.

The story of Ed Scheuermann is.

well known, that of the potential
unfulfilled, but against WVU he
came through with some key
rebounds and good play, and bowed
out a winner.

The team, the seniors, and the sea- 3“

son can be typified by Clancy’s game
on Saturday. Already playing with a
bad ankle, Clancy re-injured it dur-
ing the game and also hurt his back
when a Mountaineer landed on him.
But he kept coming back, even stuf-

with class.

ln the broader scheme of things,
the Pitt men’s volleyball team’s
thrashing of Army this weekend at
West Point may have grave
implications. The Panthers swept
the Cadets in three straight games to
win the match and pose the
frightening question— are the boys
defending ou_r country as weak as
the boys on the court?

Although Army managed to keep
the scores deceivingly close in the
first two games. as Pitt won l5-l0
and l5-l2. it was mainly Panther
mistakes that allowed Army to get
back into the contest. ln the third
game, Pitt head coach Ray Reilly
continued to.substitute freely as Pitt
rolled to a l5-3 victory to clinch the
match.

“It was a long way to drive for 45
minutes of volleyball,” said Reilly.
“We warmed up longer than we
actually played.”

But the nine-hour driveifor the
Panthers wasn’t a total waste. The

victory'evened Pitt’s league record ‘

to 1-1 and boosted the team's overall
match record to l0-7.

_ Reilly also may have found the
starting outside hitter he was
looking for last weekend. In a four-
way battle for the spot, Reilly said
Dan O’Donnell has emerged to take
charge of the position, based on his
consistent play in the last two weeks.
Earlier in’ the season, O’Donnell’s
performances "were. plagued by
mistakes, but he has started the last
two Pitt matches and played well,
according to Reilly.’

swimmers. Carter is another

performer who swims well under‘
pressure, as his best season times

have come against WVU, Penn

State, and ,North Carolina State.

Rick's 6-foot-4 frame‘ has been

helpful also, since it only takes him

I I freestyle strokes to complete one

lap.

All three swimmers—Pidgeon,
Carter, and Shearer— agree that
coach Lewis is one of the best and
had a lot to do with their decision to
come to Pitt. Lewis, who
communicates well with ,_his
swimmers, is a graduate of Pitt with"
an excellent swimmmingpcareer of
his own. He has also served for»/ﬁve
years as coach "of the Pittsburgh ‘
Aquatic Club, which has trained
area ‘swimmers for Senior National

“U’Donnell has come around and
eliminated a lot of his previous
mistakes to take charge," Reilly
said. “He's pretty much won thejob
unless he reverts to making mistakes
again.”

But it may ultimately be up to the
trainers, and not Reilly, to

determine ifOjDonnell will continue
in his starting role. ODonnell

injured his thumb Saturday on the
cable in the top of the net, and his
playing status will be determined

Monday when x-rays are taken. If

the thumb is broken, O’Donnell
would probably be sidelined at least
two to three weeks, Reilly said.

The Pitt serving game returned in
good shape against the Cadets after
deserting the Panthers at times in

last week‘s Pitt lnvitational. The
Panthers’ excellent serving forced

the weak Army team into numerous,

mistakes that converted-into easy
points for Pitt.

Reilly said he was pleased with the
performances of his players who
came off the bench in the third game

to ice the win. -Jim Grant, _Mike,

Petock, and Dave Mitas combined
with starters Bill Knuth, Brian
Devine, and Dave Baird to post the
l5-3 victory, Pitt’s largest winning
margin of the afternoon.

“We played ,pretty steady
throughout the match,” said Reilly,

“considering there was really no. '

pressure on us. They’re a weak team
for Division I play.”

The Army‘? ...-Weak? Somebody,
quick, get orr the horn, tell the
President. I

HAAU Chamionships, Olympic
trials, and the Pitt swim team.

It is Lewis’ fine coaching that
keeps those team records breaking.
In fact; only one team record still
stands that came from a Pitt swim

.team n__ot coached by Lewis. This

year’s Panthers seniors credit Lewis
for their three-year record ‘of 35-3, a
dream come true.

This year is another dream, '
, although slightly flawed by two

losses, iniwhich the 17.5 men (a diver
only counts for one-halfand I8 is the
limit) going to Easterns should
repeat ‘Pitt’s Eastern championship.
The competition will come mainly

‘from WVU, Penn‘ State, and

Men and Women Victorious

  Gymnasts Overcome Injuries 2

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

’itt News Sports Editor

The .Pitt men's and women’s
gymnastics teams -went their
seperate ways this weekend, but the
results were almost the same, as both
teams easily won their dual meets,
despite‘ the preponderance of
injuries to each team.

Lately, the rosters for both teams
have had to split most of their time
between the practice facilities and
the trainer room. Still, the men
handily defeated Kent State at
home, 247.45 to 228.8, as the women
outclassed Temple in Philadelphia,
l38.85 to I08.

The Pantherettes swept the top
three places in all four events and
also the top two spots in the all-
around competition. Pitt’s
nationally-ranked Lisa Shirk scored
a 9.5 to win the uneven bars event,
and Pantherette Holly Martino
grabbed two firsts in the floor

exercises and the vault
Karen Martin won two second-

places in the unevens and the vault.

and finished third in the floor
exercises to win the all-around
competition, followed by teammate
Regina Carson in second. Carson
finished first in the balance beam
with a 8.9, and tied for first in the
floor exercises with Martino.

“I was pleased with the meet in
general, and our high score away
from home,” said Sanft. “The team
did a good job, even though
practically everyone is competing
hurt, and our final score improved
on the last of our top—four team
scores, which helps our chances of
going to nationals.”

Sanft is hoping to have her team
back in full force when the
Pantherettes, ranked second in the
East, meet third-ranked West
Virginia this weekend at Trees Hall.

The Pittmen, facing more serious
injury problems than their female
counterparts, still managed to easily
outdistance Kent State at Trees Hall

all Pitt as the Panthers won the next
five events in a runaway.

Junior Bob Besong led the
Panthers with first-place finishes in
the floor exercises, rings, vault and
the parallel bars and en route to his
first in the all-around. Freshman
Frank Kraft also turned in a
sparkling effort with three second
place wins, in the rings, vault and the
all-around, and a first-place tie with
Besong in the parallel bars.

Both Besong and Kraft are
averaging almost 9.0 over the six
events which comprise the all-
around, and have a good chance of
advancing to the NCAA National
Championships this year if they can
keep up their scoring averages. Only
six individuals from the 40-plus
schools in the East get to advance to
Nationals. Should either gymnast
qualify, it would mark the first time

nationals in the past 25 years,

The Pitt wrestling team traveled
to Clarion this weekend for a dual
meet with Clarion State College, one
of theitop teams in the East. The
result was predictable. Clarion
romped over Pitt 39-8. Clarion, a
wrestling powerhouse with one ofits
wrestlers nationally ranked, proved
to be too tough an opponent for the
young Panther grapplers. ’

Although the result was
disappointing. Pitt coach Randy
Stottlemeyer saw some positive
things. Craig Ritchey, wrestling at
_l42, won a decision 7-5, and junior
redshirt Mike Bond, at 150, won a
super-superior decision, l7-7. Bond,
an often hurt four-year wrestler, was
the subject of much of
Stottlemeyer’s optimism.

“Mike looked good after being
out with a cracked rib. He‘s still
‘getting in shape, and hopefully he’ll
be ready for the Easterns,”
Stottlemeyer said. “He’s a hard-luck.

Championships. Previously, she
qualified for the 300-meter dash.
Murray also -anchored the two-
mile relay team, which also set a new
Pitt record. The foursome of Pam
Gearing, Sally Higgins; Valerie
Strasser and Murray churned out a
time of 9:34, slicing two seconds off
the record they had set just two
weeks. The timewas good enough to
earn the quartet a second-place
finish. ’
Strasser and Higgins were also
impressive in the I500-meter run.
Strasser circled the track in 4:51, fin-
ishing in second place. Higgins
crossed the line with a time of 5:04,
. _notching sixth-place. Both times

eclipsed the old Pitt record set in 4

Stottlemeyer recognized clearly -
that Clarion State whipped his"
Panthers, but said there is reason to
remain optimistic. With five
freshmen starting the Panthers have
an extremely young team that
should improve upon its 4-l4 dual
meet record this year. -
Pittfs next meet _will be at
Cleveland State for the EWL
qualifications and Panthers hope
the result will be better than this
weekend‘s trip to Clar-ion.
Stottlemeyer is looking forward to
the Easterns for it gives wrestlers
who have been doing well a chance
to gain some recognition.
“Although it has been a
disappointing year, the Easterns will
give a chance for individual
achievement," said Stottlemeyer.
