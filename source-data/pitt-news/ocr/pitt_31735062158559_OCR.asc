Representative

Slated To Talk
Next Thursday

U,_ S. Representative Hugh
Scott, Republican candidate
for United States senator, will

' speak to the students and faci-

ulty of’ the Upiversity on
Thursday, Oct. 16 at noon in
the Student Union Ballroom.

This is the second Midday Series
Program, sponsored jointly by The
Pitt News and the Program for
Practical Political Education, to
bring a prominent political candi-
date to the Pitt campus.

In a speech before the Republi-
can State Committee on Sept. 6,
Scott revealed his .personal politi-
cal philosophy as well as his views
on the proper type of campaign.

In ‘iis own words, his is a
“middle of the road” policy. Al-
though generally described as an
Eisenhower~ supporter, he has
not hesitated to diﬁer with the
Administration.

Commenting on his personal
philosophy A as a public servant,
Scott said, “Public office is an op-
portunity to create, for all kinds
and conditions of people, the sort
of government which will be..fair
to them and which will improve
their state of living.” ~

Scott has been elected as repre-
sentative to Congress for eight
terms from a predominantly demo-
cratic district. His 16 year service
in Congress began in 1940.

‘ In 1948 and 1949 he was the
national chairman of the Repub-
lican Party. This past Congress
he was.a member of the House
Rules Committee.

Scott places mum emphasis on
his past political record in the cur-
rent campaign for the Senate.

“I have been conservative where
the rights of property are con-
cerned, liberal where the rights of
people are involved,” he com-
mented. .

‘In 16> years he has voted-

against 20 billions of dollars of
expenditures which he consid-
ered unnecessary or wasteful
projects. ‘ T

_“Pen11’s Woods West” Puts to Practice
Advanced Composition Course Precepts

Edwin L. Peterson, professor of English, and his collab-
orator, Thomas M. Jarrett, University photographer, have
produced with the publication of Penn’s Woods West, a book

which tells of the natural beaut

y of Western Pennsylvania.

This book is of more than passing interest to the.Pitt stu-
dent body. Professor Peterson has for many years conducted

, the creative writing courses at tllk.

University, and following the re-
tirement of Professor Percival
Hunt, he has guided the ‘composi-
tion courses required of all Pitt
students.

Last spring, when it was known
that the manuscript was. com-
pleted, one writing major said,
“The chips are down, and we will
now see how the master plays the
game.”

Shows How to Write

Without quibbling, it must be
said that the master has shown
how to wfiite. Paragraph after
paragraph, page after page, the
precepts of English 1, 17, and 25,
not to mention more advanced
courses, are illustrated in Penn's
Woods West.

Debate Members
Begin This Week

Intramural Series

The intramural extension de-
bate program of the William Pitt
Debate Union began this week.

Four major service club debates

topics were scheduled for this
week.

Yesterday evening Ann Abbin—
anti and John Strauch appeared
before the Elizabeth Lions Club
to debate Russian Education. That
same evening Jim Pomarico and
Dick Mattern debated, at the
Lower Beaver Valley Kiwanis.

This evening Gerry Sack and
Tom Ribich are scheduled to de-
bate Russian Education at the
Monroeville Lions Club. Tomor-
row Dick Mattern and Jerry Sack
will debate the Right To Work
Laws before the Greater Pgh. Air-
port Lions Club.

Professor Peterson puts to

shame the criticism leveled at,

the methods used in those
courses. The simplicity, the
grace, and the power of com-
munication shown in every one
of his pages puts toshame gen-
erations of Pitt student,writers
who could not bother to hear,
see, and ‘feel the life around
them.

Never being able to “come
alive,” most writing students have
blamed the course, rather -than
themselves.

Has Sharp Details

Penn’s Woods West begins with
a simple, expository paragraph.
What Pitt student will not recog-
nize the topic sentence, complete
with subject and attitude; the
sharp details, each one support-
ing ‘and developing the topic sen-
tence; the “clincher,” followed

by the transition ' sentence.
“Pennsylvania ’means many
things to different people. To
one it means the glow of steel
mills along the Monongahela at
night or strip mines in Venango

County or the milky water of ~

the Clarion at Johnsonburg.

To another it means the trout
streams of Centre County
thelong beach bordered by cot-
tonwoods at Presque Isle, or the
ski slopes at Ligonier when the
snow lies deep upon the moun-
tains.

Or it means an eagle seen from
Mt. Davis ﬁghting its way through
a thunderstorm . . . acres of tril-
lium along Thorn Creek, or the
pink mountains of Bedford County
when the wild azaleas bloom. For
each of us there is a favorite pic-

ture or recollection". Mine takes

me back.a good many years.”
And there, with the transition

Thomas Jarrett, with his camera pointing probingly ‘to set down in striking photograph the works of
nature, stands poised as Edwin Peterson observes before writing in matchless prose. '

sentence, the reader is prepared
for the delightful, straight—for-
ward narrative.

“I was in Miss Murphy’s class
in the sixth grade when I ﬁrst
learned . . .”

The book’s organization is
centered around the four sea-
sons, the account of places visit-

ed by the author being pre-
ceded by introductory essays on

Leo the Lion, the Horse, and the

Hunter. Of these essays, “The
..Swan” and “The Hunter” are

particularly pleasing.

For good writing the first para-
graph of “Thorn Creek” illus-
trates what Professor Peterson can
do. . '

“Perfect Day Not Common”

“In the course of a year there

. are .many good days for back-

road driving, but the perfect day
is not common. It should follow
a night of gentle rain, enoughto
settle the dust but not ﬁll the road
with puddles or the valley stream
with silt.

There should be a bright sun
and a blue sky with a few, a very
few, cumulus clouds. Some of the
songbirds should be back—par-
ticularly the Maryland yellow-
throats—so that even when you
are driving you can see them ﬂash
along the roadside and hear brief
excerpts from their songs.

“Watch out,
he’s after your

  
  
 
 
  
 
   
  
 
 
 

More.people chase after
Camels than any other cig-
arette today. And'no won-
der! For rich flavor and
"easygoing mi1dness,Camel’s
blend of costly tobaccos has .
never been equalled. More
and more smokers are dis-
covering that the best to-
bacco makes‘the best smoke.
Year after year, Camels are
America’s No. 1 cigarette.

Don’? fool around with
fads and fancy stuff...

Have a r_e_a_!

And a few of the wildﬂowers
that come ‘before theswallow
dares’ should be in lusty bloom
—if not the skunk cabbage, then
hepatica or yellow adder’s-
tongue. Such days are rare and
should be accepted whenever of-
'fered.”

Professor Peterson followed the
trails along the Loyalhanna and
ﬁshed there. He brought his canoe
from the headwaters of the Alle-
gheny to Pittsburgh. He visited
Penn’s Woods West from Ohiopyle
and Mt. Davis in the south to the
eerie Bog on New York’s line.

Reveals Man and Teacher

The account of the trip makes
good reading. On every page the
reader can take the measure of
Professor Peterson as a writer.
Perhaps more revealing is the rev-
elation of the man and the teach-
er. Not often does any reader
come upon such statements as are
found in the conclusion of the
book.

In producing Penn’s Vvood
West, the author and Mr. Jarrett,
whose photographs deserve a full

review in themselves, have had
the aid of the Buhl Foundation,

with the University of Pittsburgh.

it Opinion Off   The Record

_ When should the administration ask for and ponder
student opinion and when shouldn’t they? This question has
arisen at this time because a statement that was made to a

reporter in an interview concerning the future use of Uni-

‘versity-owned building.

The building and the administrator who was inter-
viewed must remain anonymous, for the informationthat
said administrator gave was declared to be “off the record.”

M In telling the reporter that the information was not for
print, the executive said that the use of the building will be
‘decided upon within the next few weeks and they didn’t

want any student opinion being mixed intothe present dis-
- cussion. Only the administration’s ideas were wanted.

This stress upon not wanting student opinion is a seri-
ous mistake; However, we feel that it was a mistake on
the part of only the administrator. His statement doesn’t
seem .to ﬁt in witlrheretofore unannounced, but known,

policy of Chancellor Litchﬁeld that student opinion should’

be obtained in almost every case where an important de-
cision has to be made or policy has to be established.
Although such student opinion may not carry too much
weight in certain cases, it nevertheless is desired” by the
Chancellor. Once, in an interview with a student reporter
concerning the possible use of Pitt Stadium by the Pitts-
burgh Steelers, the Chancellor stopped the reporter in the

Schlesinger For TheADA

”  A By David Breaksfone
Now is the time of the “soft sell” and the hard
handshake. The little,-used _manuals on rhetoric

- and oratory receive persistent, anxious examina-

tion. _Old wounds break_open' with uncanny -tim-
ing, and the walls which separate men are fortiﬁed
and repaired as if it were mending-time in spring.

Election season in the United States draws near‘,
‘bringing with it those phenom-  .
ena which- are peculiar to its ad- 
vent. It is an exciting time, made _.
so by the men and issues that
control a nation and its exist-
ence. Tension grows steadily as 1
the days fall away and with in-
creased- drama, political hopes
sporadically rise and fall. Crises _
occur weekly,‘ then daily, then
hourly as the appointed Tuesday
approaches. V
Thoughtful and Crii-icdl

That approaching Tuesday," November 4, has
brought and will bring a number of eminent speak-

   

ers to Pittsburgh to promote their particular po1iti- .

cal interest. However, the impressive array of
future speakers will do well if it canduplicate
the thoughtful, critical, and entertaining presenta-
tion of Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., last Saturda
evening. ‘ ~

Mr. Schlesinger is a professor of history at Har-
vard, has written numerous historical and political
books, such as the Pulitzer Prize—winning The
Age of Jackson, and is prominent as a member of
the Democratic Party braintrust. He was in__ town
on Saturday to address both the Leader—Lawrence
rally and a gathering of the Americans for Demo-
cratic Action (ADA). 

At the _ADA affair Mr. Schlesinger, a three-but-
ton man in the eastern tradition, promised to speak
generally of national politics and then to narrow
the subject to the upcoming elections. Predictably,
he immediately assailed “the vacuum of national
leadership” and called the Formosan trouble an-
other example of Mr. Dulles’ patented “brinkman-
ship,” in an advanced stage.

This lack of direction in the national executive
government he labeled as the underlying issue in
-the November election. He neatly remarked, at
this point, that the aimlessness of the «U. S. for-
eign policy has placed President Eisenhower and
Secretary Dulles in the role of “unconscious come-
dians” in the eyes of world opinion. .
Passive’ Leadership-

In exploring Mr. Eisenhower’s role as President,
he likened it to Teddy Roosevelt’s concept of the

  Letters To

‘ “Buchanan.-Taft president”——-one_who takes a pas-

sive role in the nation’s leadership and does only

gthose things speciﬁcally delegated to him in the
Constitution. Schlesinger argued that the‘ country
presently needs a “Jackson-Lincoln” leader who
believes in actively pursuing the initiative by
broadly construing the Constitution. “

He blamed the President’s military and academic
background for not providing him with the kind
of experience necessary for as complex a political
position as the -presidency. He wryly noted that.
Mr. Eisenhower’s ‘experience as NATO chief in
Paris had obviouslyxgiven him the mistaken im-
pression that the U. S. Presidency was the same as
the similar position in the French government.

This lackof action_ for six years has resulted
in a “policy” or “do nothing and then invoke mili-
tary action.” ‘,‘We saw this attitude displayed in
Formosa, most recently,” stated the professor, “and
before that in Lebanon, in Little Rock, and in
Panama, after Mr. Nixon’s famous ‘ill-will’ tour.”
Worst U. S. Blunder.

Mr. Schlesinger reached the climax of his re-
marks by "terming the current Far Eastern muddle
“one of the worst blunders in U. S. diplomatic
history.” He, asserted that the proof of this claim
is contained in General Matthew B. Ridgeway’s
autobiography, published in 1956. The General
speciﬁcally warned against the dangers of the very
situation the nation ﬁnds itself in today. “We had
almost three years’ warning,” Mr. Schlesinger de-
cided, “and yet not a finger was lifted to control
the situation or Chiang.” . V

Professor Schlesinger ﬁnally called for the elec-
tion of liberal, active leaders to the Congress and
put in the customarypplugs for Lawrence and
Leader. In sticking to ADA principles (they are not
officially behind either party, rather individuals),
Schlesinger voiced his disappointment with the
Democratic senatorial candidates in New York and
Connecticut. This opinion had previously been
stated in his recent New Republic article. He said
thathe hoped that similar politically expedient
measures would be abandoned in the future for
the national interest.

Gathering up his raincoat and brief case. Mr..

Schlesinger faced the East and resolutely set off
for Cambridge.

The political season was strikingly opened wide
and the professor left a horde of injured Republi-
cans in his wake. “Just let that free-spending ADA
mob get into Washington and then you’ll really
have something to moan about,” they grumbled as
the day grew nearer and“"the cmnpaign more in-
tense. '

Allow me this informal note
thanking .Mr. Amdur for some
rather profound and astute ob-
servations .in The Pitt News
Article of Oct. 1. However, I
must, take exception to his re-

cent comments in re the'Que-’

moy-Taiwan question.
I do not favor recognition of

nomically, militarily, techno-

logically with communism is a_

known fact. I doubt that we can
remain on a global defensive and
ultimately survive.

Thus, while we must maintain
sufficient military power to pre-
clude war ‘until that last mo-
ment when the Red leaders must
gamble -—“‘all or nothing at all”

they are no more. Where is free ,.

Poland? Hungary?

An insatible appetite that, my
friend, I don’t believe will be
be appeased if it does get the
Quemoys. To change this policy
with regard to Taiwan and the
Quemoys I ﬁrmly believe will
yield disaster. ‘

Michigan State has been a_ mem-

This is Head Coach Duffy

Daugherty’s ﬁfth season at the

Spartan helm. He was line coach

under Biggie Munn, the present

athletic director.

' His record stands at 29 won and
10'1ost and in 1955 he was_named
“Coach of the Year” by the largest
margin of votes in the 23-year
history of the Scripps-How_ard

have ever downed the Gophers.

But Zanos also has memories of the earlier game, the
one_in which a clipping penalty (that never appeared in the
game movies) cost Pitt a victory. One recollection, in particu-
lar, stands out in his mind and was one reason why he want-
ed to be on a winning Panther team in Minnesota this season.

“I’ll never forget them (the fans) calling us ‘Ivy
, Leaguers’ when we came out on the ﬁeld before the game,”
. Jim relates. He does add, however, that these samefans

cheered the team after the game was over.
' * =i< * *

=l=

Zanos almost did something this past Saturday that he
has yet to do in his three years as a varsity end: score a
touchdown. Midway in the fourth quarter, when Pitt was
down, 7-0-, Bill Kaliden threw a pass "from the Gopher 20 to
Zanos on the one.

V The six-foot, 195—pound left end grabbed the aerial but
was unable to get into,.;the end zone. “I started to run,” he
i said, -_“I thought I could make it. But one ‘
of the Minnesota players hit me from the
side and knocked me sidewards.”
Displaying a trait that is likeable in’
. any football player, Zanos remarked,

“‘Kaliden took it over, though. It doesn’t
matter who scores. Six points goes up
anyway.”

.* ,

=i~' *

    

One reason why the Panthers had a- _
rough time against the Gophers, Zanos "ANos'
feels, is because the players were reading the papers too
much. Of course, he said that he expected Minnesota to be

‘,‘good and lrard” and they were,
Asked to compare the passing attack of Holy Cross’ Tom
Greene with the Gophers’ Jim Reese, Jim said, “They (Minne-
sota) had six times a-s good blocking for the passer than Holy
Cross. I always had to get through two guys.”

Factions Appear
In Ranks ‘of Yogis

After the ﬁrst three weeks of
Yogi selections, there seems to
have arisen two factions. One is
the group which manages to get
a majority of their picks right;
the other consists of “experts”,
David Breakstone and Murray
Chass.

No other explanation is neces-
sary if the results of last week's
games and the season totals are
studied closely.

One game is missing from the
totals, that being the Claremont-
Mudd-Chino battle. For all the
Yogis know, those two colorful

« institutions are still going at it.
Here_ is the up-to-date Yogi

“In the second half, Minnesota took longer to pass, and
that gave us more time to get in there.’.’ Zanos had high
praise for one of those two guys he had to get through. He.
said that the Gophers’ left tackle, Norm Sixta, washittin-g
him good and dropping him low the whole game.

  Panthers Expect Injured A to Play
Against Michigan

By LARRY HAGGERTY

The Panther football team,
with three consecutive wins
alreadyon the docket, travels
to the Midwest again this Sat-
urday to try to solidify their
high national ranking.-‘ The never-
say—die Blue and Gold will invade
Michigan to tackle a revenge-'
minded Michigan State team.

At East Lansing, the Spartans of
Coach Duffy Daugherty will try to
make amends for their sub-normal‘
showing against Michigan last
weekin which they were held to
a 12-12 tie. The Spartans had been
established a_two touchdown fav-
orite before they took the ﬁeld‘
against their arch rival. _

A crowd of upwards of 60,000 is
expected for the 2:30 kick-off at
Spartan Stadium. Because they
are rated among the top ﬁve teams
nationally, Michigan State will
probably rule a touchdown favor-
ite at game time. ‘

Full Strength Expected

The Panthers expect to be at
almost full strength for their bat-
tle this weekend. Only Dick Haley
and Ivan Toncic missed the game
with Minnesota entirely while Art
Gob was in for just one play in

the fourth quarter against the,
Gophers. All three, however, are

expected to play on a part-time
basis. A
Co-captain Ed Michaels suf-
fered a recurrence of an elbow
injury in the first half against
Minnesota and had to miss the
rest of the game. “Michaels spe-
cializes in healing fast and
should be in the starting lineup
on Saturday,” commented Train-
er Howard Waite.
The quarterback situation is still
very much in doubt. Coach John

. Michelosen, who does not rate his

squad by ﬁrst or second strings,
but prefers to, denote his players
by units instead, refuses to name a
starter. .
Toncic Available Too

In the game last week, Ed Sha-
rockman operated with the “A”
unit in the first half while Bill
Kaliden took care of the signal
calling duties for the “B” group.

Toncic, meanwhile, also will,
be available for duty if both
' Sharockman and Kaliden have
trouble penetrating the Michi-
gan State defenses. The num-
ber four quarterback is Pete

Prince.

“The success in our ﬁrst three
games can be attributed mainly to
a single factor,” stated Jack Wi-
ley, the Blue and Go1d’s line coach.
“This year we have depth and that
is why there is a vast improve-
ment over the 1957 squad.”

“Also,” said Wiley, “the boys in

Big Ten way.”

Looking to _the upcoming
game with Michigan State, a
Big Ten powerhouse, Zanos
says, ’ “'State’s going to be
looking for us." We have three
wins, and already one over a
Big Ten team.”

If it sounds as though the
Panther senior feels espe-
cially strong about coming
out on top against the Mid-
that’s
exactly. correct. “I just like to

beat the Big Ten. They think _

they’re the only ones wh
play ball.” ‘
Note to Jim and any other
interested Panther gridder:
Michigan State is another

READY for full scale action against Michigan State this Saturday are

Teacher Heads T riState Council

Graduate Students
Hail Top Educator,
Maurice T h0rna.slA

“He is a ‘master teacher.”
These words are used by
many graduate school stu-
dents to describe Dr. Maurice
Thomas, professor of educa-
tion at the University.

Since 1950 this “teacher of
teachers” has directed 35 teachers,
principals, and superintendents of

the tri—state areas through their
doctorate candidacies. A shelf full

of doctorate dissertations in his
office attests to this fact.
Top Educator
Director of courses in educa-

tional administration and execu-
tive secretary of the Tri-state
Area School Study Council since
1948, Thomas is considered one of
the top educators throughout ‘the
nation.

Through his signiﬁcant tele-
vision programs on KDI{A—TV
every Sunday afternoon and his
many writings, speeches, and
surveys throughout the area, Dr.
Thomas has focused much at-
tention on the University.

"In a period covering some 30
years, he has served in every pos-
sible phase of education. In his
role as educator he has been an
elementary_ teacher, elementary
principal, high school teacher and
principal, and Superintendent of
Schools in Rochester, Minnesota.

Directs Council

One of the most signiﬁcant ac-
tivities by Thomas is the Tri-
State Area School Study Council.

This summer Thomas organ-
ized and directed a School Ad-
ministration Conference spon-
sored by the University. Nation-
al leaders in education took
part. "

Best Possible
“The primary task of educa-
tional leadership is to make our
public schools as good as ‘educa-

tional scientists know how to make
them,” states Thomas.

A nationally-prominent author,
Dr. Thomas has written numer-
ous books, pamphlets, and mag-
azine articles. Frequently sought
and highly recognized are his
surveys of schools and school
districts.

His life and work are celebrated

Dr. Thomas commented on the
marked increase in the number
of educators who continue to
supplement their education and
obtain master’s_ and doctorate
degrees.

“As requirements are increased
the rewards of teaching are in—-
creased, and stand_ards are raised.
Teaching has truly becomepa pro-
fession in every sense of the

word,” he remarked.
