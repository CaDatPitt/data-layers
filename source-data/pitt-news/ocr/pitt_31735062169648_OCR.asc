Violence-‘Draft’

Conant Maps

_e Unrest Causes

by JUDITH GALIARDI
Staff News Writer

What is happening ‘and what
will happen to activist students?
At an interview with the Pitt
News, Safety Director David
Craig said, “Activist students are
said to provide no alternatives for
the changes they are working for.

    

DR. RALPH CONANT
When the conscientious activists
move into specialization — which
is inevitable — they will begin to
make their changes within their
particular field. The aspiring
teacher will use his own method
to teach. thus procuring changes
within the organization.”

Dr. Ralph Conant, director of
the Lemberg Center on the Study
of Violence, remarked that there

Anaylzes Draft

A by DAVE KUHNS
Staff News Writer »

In spite of ROTC’s current pre-
dominance‘ in the limelight of
campus debate» these days, the
whole student—military relation-
ship, specifically the draft re-
mains of. great concern tomany in
the University community.

The question is primarily‘ one

of morality and secondarily one
of constitutionality. Does the fed-
eral government have the right to
impress citizens into military ser-
vice without the consent of those
citizens? Many students are talk-
ing about it, yet only a few have
made_ the decision to manifest
their beliefs in action. These in-
dividuals have banned together
forming an organization known as
Pittsburgh Areas Resistance. Two
of t-hei r number, Prof. David
Houston of the Department of Ec-
onomics and Joshua Chasan, a
teaching Fellow in the graduate
school of History,7 appeared as
guest speakers at last Thursdays
Student-Faculty Luncheon to dis-
cuss the case for draft resistance.

Prof. Houston began’ byjstating
that “society in general is inequit-
able, so it’s really unfair to single
out the draft.” Confining -his re-
marks to the subject in question,

ROTC Open Forum

. by DAMAINE MARTIN
Staff News Writer

Friday’s ROTC Open Forum
was rather like the Good Guys vs.
the Bad Guys, depending on
whose side you were on. Speak-
ing in defense of the ROTC pro-
gram at the University were Dave
Ehrenworth, a cadet sergeant, and
Jack La Pietra, president of the
Cadet Brigade Organization. Op-
possing them, Joe Kociubes and
Ken Schueler presented their case
against ROTC.

The.crowd of approximately 200
which gathered in the SU Ball-
room to hear the debate, con-
tained uniformed ROTC mem-
bers as well as students who heck-
led -Ehrensworth and La Pietra
during their defense of the pro-
gram.

La Pietra began the debate,
stating. the “The accredited op-

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH,

by EARL JACOBS
Staff News Writer '

Why would anybody want to in-
vest in a new building that is go-
ing _to be torn down within a year?
Why will construction costs for fu-
ture University classrooms be so
high? Some of the answers may
be found in the plans for the Uni-
versity’s new graduate school com-
plex. ;

Edison Montgomery, the Uni-
versity’s vice- chancellor of fi-
nance, told The Pitt News last
month that the Civic Center Mo-
tel, Stuckertls Gas Station, and the

block that includes Bins_tock’s and ‘

Henry-Henry’s would be con-
demned soon by the General State
Authority ( G S A ). Montgomery
added that current plans call for
these buildings to be razed by Jan-
uary 1, 1970. He said that the
Graduate School of LibrarytSci-
ences, the School of Social Sci-
ences, and the School of. Education

‘ would be constructed on this site.

Since ‘t h at time, McDonald’s 

Hamburgers, has started to refur-
bish the old Clock Restaurant,
which is located on the soon to be
condemned block. Stuckert’s has;
built a new gas station on its pro-
perty. Since the property will be
demolished soon, why are they
building? -

Publication Board Declines Review

by BRUCE LEVENSON

Staff News Editor

After one hour of presentation and three hours

the language usedby Alternatives on its cover. In

light of this fact, the Publications Board will not

of discussion at a meeting Friday, the Publications

Board declined to review the question of “good
taste” in relation to Alternatives, number three.

The third edition of Alternatives contained “ob-
language pertaining to President -elect
Richard Nixon on its front cover artwork.

Dean of Students N. Ronald Pease presented the
issue before the Publications Board. He hoped that
the Board would define “good taste” and decide
if this particular edition of Alternatives fell with-

in these limits.

Jim Wolfe, [University lawye,r,, attested th at
.. there was no criminal or civil liability -inherent in‘-

scene”

 

review this case.

The Board decided that “Whereas there is no
apparent issue of criminal or civil liability in vol-
ume three of Alternatives, therefore this publica-
tion board declines to review the case referred to
it by Dean Pease.”

The Committee on Student Organizations (for-
merly Recognitions Committee) was scheduled to
meet on Friday also to discuss this case. The meet-
ing was cancelled because it was felt that it would
have been too soon for a discussion of this impor-

; tance. It was later decided that there is not neces-
» sity.for this meeting to be‘-held at all.  i  '

_Only yesterday, Montgomery
told The Pitt News that ”everyone
of the owners was notifieda year
ago about the construction. They
knew that GSA would give con-
demnation notices.” Elmer Stuck-
ert disagrees. He said that he does-
n’t own his gas station, but rents
from the Humble Oil Company.
“Nobody has contacted Humble,”
said Stuckert. “If Humble had
been contacted, I’m sure they
would have built somewhere
else.” But Montgomery main-
tains that “Humble knew darn
well that the building would be
condemned.”

. George Kusevich, contractor for
the‘ new McDonald’s building,
said that “we’ve heard rumors
about demolition. I’m sure Mc-
Donalds knows — they’ve invest-

I ed $80,000 in the building. They

probably want to make money as
long as they can.” But apparent-

. ly Mr. Kusevich has not talked
with McDonalds. ' Jim Deligatta,'

the hamburger chain’s operator

for the Pittsburgh area, said, “I_

heard that someday the Universi-
ty might build, but I don’t know
specifically when they’ll build.
I have personally heard nothing
about-it.” . ~

Has a specific date been es-
tablished for the demolition of
buildings for the graduate school

  

JACK La PIETRA

noting that “The ROTC program
is as academic a discipline as I’ve
studied.” He also pointed out that
the instructors are not tied to the
Instructor’s Guide, but free, as in
any other course, to depart from
it. His final point centeredon the
“initiativeandimagination ”
which the program demands in
problem solving.

Kociubes countered La Pietra’s
defenseby pointing out that the
student’s don’t want the program.
He cited a list of student and fac-
ulty committees which had voted
to oppose ROTC at the Universi-
ty, adding that the only Univer-
sity organization which favors
it isthe Men’s Dormitory Coun-
cil, "‘which has also voted to sup-
port banning sexual intercourse
from the dormitories.”

Discounting the two re,feren- '

dums in which a majority of stu-
dents voted to continue the pro-
gram, Kociubes noted that they
were poorly publicized and that
one was held, in conjunction with

Process ‘68's Student Rights Committee has proposed a series of
student independent research projects for credit.

‘These projects would be’ on controversial subjects such as air

is to encourage active self-education on important contemporary sub-

 

Think selﬁshly about your
own career before you decide
on one with Du Pont.

Be selﬁsh. But be honest.

Youive put in a lot of tough years

to getyour degree. Your allegiance

lies with a professional discipline. _

Why, then, must you decide now

‘ to plight your trust to a company
for life? Don’t. Join a company

vﬁrst. If it doesn’t

advance you within that

‘ professional discipline,
well, you're not
married to it.

    
  
 
 
 
  

Manyhave found career-

enrichment at -Du Pont. This comes

from being handed a ball and

being expected to run with it. From

working with top people, from
growing in a company where the

opportunities are always wide open
and the projects are often way out.

Many have found professional

fulﬁllment and have built a very full,
varied and happy life as “Du Ponters.”
Others have found, after working

at Du Pont, that their professional

interest lay in teaching, in further
. study or in an industry that

offered even wider scope in their
particular discipline. All of these

men left Du Pont far better qualiﬁed
professionally than when they came.

So talk tothe Du Pont recruiter.
If he oﬁ.'ers_you something, think

of it as a professional challenge, not

a proposal of marriage.

The topics and credits for the re-

Exhaustion

by JIM MARGITAN
Staff News Writer

When John Cavaluchy awoke
on the morning of Thursday.
Nov. 14, he never realized that
he wouldn’t be in bed again for
the next six days. In those early
morning hours. he had no inkling
of the fact thathe would go for
144 hours (six days) without sleep
in an attempt to break the world‘s
record of 277 hours (11 days, 13
hours). Even less did he know
that he would become a celebri-
ty on campus as well _as on KQV
radio station and at Point Park
College. All things considered, it
appeared to be just another day
in the life of John A. Cavaluchy.

Indeed, Thursday wasn’t much
different from any other day un-
til that night. Thursday night,
John went to visit an ex-counselor
of Random House, Bill Peterson,
at Bill’s‘ off-campus apartment.
When he returned at 3 a.m., he
decided to stay up with another
Random House member and later
went to breakfast with a second
friend.

The conversation during the
meal turned to the MDC spon-
sored “Dorm Weekend,” and
John voiced a plan to start a
“Record-thon” and play records
in the Tower’s Lobby for, hope-
fully, 50 hours. Later that morn-
ing he decided to try for the
world's record.

That evening (Friday) at 7, he
began playing records for a 12
hour period. The reason he had to
stop was to work at the library.
His playing resumed on Saturday
at 5 and continued until Mon-
day at'noon when he again had
to stop for work, only to resume
later that day. Except for the
time at work and an occassional
class, John manned his station in
the lobby until the weariness
overcame him and he began fall-
ing asleep on Wednesday morn-

ing at 4:30. His friends fought ’

vainly to keep him awake, but not
even the ice-cold air of the pre-
dawn outside could conquer his
enemy—sleep. It was an act of_
mercy when, at’6 a.m., his com-
panions dragged him off to bed.

Throughout the battle, John re-
fused to take any pills to keep
him awake, including “No-Doz,"
saying, “Pills only prove that the
body can work well when under
the influence of drugs. If I can’t
beat the record alone, I’d rather
lose. I won’t take anything ex-
cept coffee to keep awake.”

While John fought to overcome
his body, his friends helped to
keep him busy. Playing records
helped, but it was the fact that
members of his House took turns
staying up with him and playing
cards, chess, and Monopoly. He
refused to name anyone specifi-
cally saying, “I think itwould be
unfair to mention names since
there are over 20 students helping
me. Mostly, however, it was the
officers of Men’s Dorm Council
and the residents of Random
House that did the work.”

At no time during the attempt
did he admit "to feeling tired.
Even as late as 2 a.m. on the fin-
al morning, he remarked, “I don't
feel much different than I usual-
ly do at this time. I have experi-
enced a few slow periods at about
6 a.m. but they disappear rapid-

1y. I feel remarkably well for this’

length of time without sleep. I
really think I’ll make it.”

Why did he do it? In his words,

“Some people think it’s for fame, -

but the true reason is that it’ll
be a true learning experience to
achieve something no one else
has. In my estimation, only 50
per cent of learning_ in higher
education comes’ from the class-
room. The remainder comes from
the student’s contact with his
peers and the outside world. Fur-
thermore, I want to show that
the college student does more
than protest. He’s doing construc-
tive things like setting world re-

cords.” John declined to com-.

ment on what was so construc-
tive about not sleeping.

In the closing hours of the
struggle, John exhibited great vi-
tality and gave no indications
that he would fall asleep shortly
after the half-way mark. Even
during a, monopoly game at 3

a.‘m;; John replied that he felt

“good and confident” th at he
would place his name in the rec-
ord books. At 4:30 p.m. it was a
different story. Not even the phy-
sical harassment of friends could
overcome the weariness that
urged. th ro u g h h i s exhausted

he awoke he said, “I have no

“According to my friends,” he

expecially by 56 points. And no one real-

years have proved that.

Michelosen never received help from
the athletic department. He didn’t have
a recruting staff, he didn’t have a decent
practice field, and he didn’t have co-
operation from the Pitt’s hierarchy.

DAVE HART comes here, and the
athletic department tells him he'll get

the Republican Party. He thought
that Eisenhower was a hapless
political leader, and could not
see eye to eye with the Eisenhow-
er Administration policy. A year
later, following the Congression-
al elections, Wayne Morse bolt-
ed the Republican Party to be-
come a Democrat.

Hechanged his party affilia-
tion two years before his next
quest for re-election. This, by all
standards, was an act of political
suicide, but the lion from Ore-
gon survived. He was re-elected
to the Senate in 1956 as a Demo-
crat. The voters of Oregon re-
pected a man of conviction and‘
principle.

As the escalation of the Viet-
nam war, grew, the presence of
Wayne Morse —- and internation-
alist, but not an interventionist
—became likened to dissent. In
1964, Morse was one of two Sen-
ators to vote against the Gulf of
Tonkin Resolution — a resolution
giving the President wide pow-
ers to escalate the Vietnam con-
flict.

TWO YEARS LATER, Morse
introduceda bill, against the bet-
ter wishes of Senator William
Fullbright, to repeal the_ Tonkin
Resolution. Fullbright a d v i s e d
Morse that the final vote on the
resolution would show over-
whelming Senate support for Pres-
ident Johnson. The 1964 vote was
98 to two in favor of the Admin-
istration. The 1966 vote was 95
to five in support of President
Johnson. When asked about the
bill’s ignominious defeat, Morse
said: “Look at those vote tables,
we’ve improved 150 per cent.
That’s progress.’’ ’ 1

Aside from knowing the great
feeling of victory, Wayne Morse
has tasted the bitterness of de-
feat. After announcing his can-
didacy for the Presidency, in
1960, Morse lost all of the Presi-
dential primaries that he had en-
tered. He stumped West Virginia
and lost. He campaigned in the
District of Columbia and lost.
His most depressing loss, how-
ever, was his defeat in Oregon-
his home state.

There he lost to the highly po-

lished, Kennedy machine. Know-

But then came the Saturday game

No one even felt like crying anymore.
You came to accept losing. No one real-
ly went to the game and thought Pitt

There are so many problems at Pitt,

They don’t even think for the present,
much less for the future. Routinely, each

and the ’30s, attempt to make decisions
with the same reasons they’ve used in the

has humiliated the University of Pitts-

The Grand Fallooners

by DAVID ROSENBLUM
Staff Columnist

My uncle is going to destroy
the United States. He, and about

one hundred million people like.

him, are going to bring this coun-
try to its knees. They’re not plan-
ning to burn the White House,
nor are they planning to assassi-
nate General Hershey. They are
secretly creeping around plant-
ing tiny bombs in every corner
of this country. They plant their
tiny bombs, and then detonate
them in the minds of their off-
spring.

I’ve »known my uncle for 20
years. He has his own little hard-
ware store in a small New Jer-
sey town, and he owns one of

those neat little white homes you —

always read about in Readers Di-
gest. He’s always been nice to
me, and I never thought he could
destroy something as precious as
a human mind.

..But last weekend, as I was talk-
ing to my 15 year old cousin
about the things going on in
America, this 15 year old kid spit
out comments like:

“THIS COUNTRY keeps pay-
ing those niggers to riot,” and
“There are Negroes and there are
niggers. The good ones are. Ne-
groes, and the bad ones are nig-
gersf’

Ididn’tbelieve it when I heard
it. This was my little cousin who
wears glasses and has a pet para-
keet. Yet he was spewing out
words that even George Wallace
would think twice about using.
I knew this kid just couldn’t have
thought these ideas up himself,
so I started talking to my uncle
to see if my fearswere correct.
They were. .

ing that his people had turned
their heads away from him,
Wayne Morse plunged to the
depths of political depression.
But this didn’t last long. After
his appointment as a delegate to
the United Nations General As-
sembly, Wayne Morse again be-
came his argumentative self.
Things’ were back to normal.-

WAYNE MORSE HAS a unique‘
political philosophy. When I met

him this summer he. said: .f‘When.- .

    

“Why should I pay money to
those lazy burns. They’d rather
get welfare than do anything.” ‘

“But there’s a reason for it.”

“Who cares. They’re lazy and
you know it.”

“And what about the blacks
who’re doing things?” '

“LIKE WHAT?”j

“Like creating a culture, edu-
cating kids, creating pride.”

“Look, the Jews came to this
country . . .”

“But the Jews aren’t a race,
they’re a religion.”

“It’s the same thing.”

“But th e Jews w e r e never
slaves in this country.”

“They weren’t huh?”

(‘No.73

“Ya know, when I was a kid.”

And blahfblah, blah.

When I started talking about
draft resistence, the conversation
became even more digusting.

“THOSE HIPPIES are noth-
ing but yellow-bellied cowards.”

“And what if they can’t justi-
fy killing?”

“You can’t have everyone run-
ning around thinking what he
wants to think. The country has
to be united."People have to think
the same. If you don’t like this

‘country, you should get your ass
‘out of here.”

“Sounds like you want every-
one to walk like geese.”

“It’s not the same thing.”

No uncle, it never is. A judge
tells a boy that he has to sen-
tence him for refusing induction
because “Congress passes the

 

ever I begin a new term in the
Senate, I always pretend that it

will be my last. This way, I can

say and do anything I want, in
spite of the interests of my con-

stituency.”

This very different philosophy
can be, in the long run, self-
defeating.When the interests of
the constituency become greater
than the personal magnetism of the
independent Senator, the quest

_for re-election is lost.. . .  ;

 

laws, and I just‘ carry them out.”
That’s not the same excuse as that
old German catch phase, “but I
was just following orders,” is it?
I wonder how many people
would condemn the German and
praise the judge?

I WONDER how many people
go around vomiting about how
this country is so great and free,
and then see someone with long
hair who immediately becomes a
hippy degenerate, faggot, acid
drinking, pot smoking, commie-
loving bastard. Why couldn’t
these people talk before they
judge?

Why _couldn’t the leftists talk
with the guy in a unifrom be-
fore they call him a facist pig.
Why couldn’t the rightists talk
with someone who was in Chi-
cago before they sing about how
corrupt and indescent he is?

I guess it’s because it takes too
much time, and it’s too much
trouble. Besides, you might find
out every sordid fantasy you have
is nothing but that: a fantasy. If
you talked with someone, and
then you didn’t like him, you
could call him whatever you
could dream up. At least you
would know what you were talk-
ing about.

But people don’t talk much ‘

anymore. My uncle and his hun-
dred million friends don’t say a
damn thing. They just walk
around upside down withtheir
heads up their rears. What this
world really needs is a conven-
tion _of grandfalloners. Then
maybe things wouldn’t be so bad;
would they Cherie with the blue
eyes?

 

So it was for Wayne Morse.
After 24 years in the Senate,
Morse had alienated many of the
people back home. And he lost
his re-election bid.’ But even in
political death, Wayne Morse
remained a man of the people.
He demanded .a vote recount be-
cause he thought that “this was
something I owed to the people.”
The people owe Wayne Morse
agreat deal. _

Editor,The Pitt News,

At the risk of having it in-
appropriately captioned, or sub-
sequently misquoted, I should like
to submit a comment on the RO-
TC controversy.

The presence of ROTC on cam-
pus is being questioned on ‘heter-
ogeneous grounds: lack of aca-
demic freedom (since the course
content is determined by an out-
side agency), the concession of

University space and undergradu- ’

ates’ time to professional train-
ing, the granting of academic
credit for courses less “humanist—
ic” than others. Additional object-
ions have been raised, but the a-
bove appear to be the main ones;
how cogent they are remains to
be seen.

Professional training? All but
the most reckless undergraduates
give some thought to the problem
of earning a living after gradua-
tion; and the programs in Educa-
tion, Pre-Med., and other such
professional areas are not being
called into question in the present
debate. Academic freedom?
Undergraduates have been known
to complain about a putative lack
of uniformity in -method and
content in, e.g., language instruc-
tion; presumably they do not wish
their instructors to have absolute
freedom in the classroom — and
if method and content are deter-
mined by someone else, -how can
the student tell whether that some-
one else is the departmental chair-
man or someone in the Pentagon?
(As to the “academic freedom of
students,” one might reiterate a
point already made in these pages:
Military Science is an elective.)

Humanistic content? This is
tricky ground; what will not be cal-

led into question once this Pandora’, '

box is opened? Consider Physical
Education for Women, a require-
ment for the B.A. -degree,and
carrying academic credit. What.
precisely, is the humanistic value
of, say, Scuba Diving in com-
parison with, say, the Air Force
General Military Course? Swim-
ming scarcely trains the mind.
yet it carries academic credit:
low grades in that or another sport
can cause, and indeed have caus-
ed, a student to miss being‘ nam-
ed University Scholar. Yet of aca-
demic credit for Physical Educa-
tion not a word is now, to my
knowledge, being spoken.

I am led to suspect some dis-
ingenuousness in the campaign

against ROTC. Can it be that the
real interest of some of those
mounting it is not academic free-
dom or humanistic values but
rather the discrediting of the
“Military establishment?” And
could their goal be to befuddle
students. faculty, and administra-
tion into doing their bit to weak-
en our defense?

As a realist, I acknowledge the
necessity for America to keep up
her capacity for defense in the
face of powerful and ruthless en-
emies; as a civilized person, I
should prefer that those responsi-
ble for defending this country
have a humanistic education as
well as military training.

A Ehrenwerth, ROTC Rapped

Editor, The Pitt News,

Mr. Ehrenwerth began his let-
ter to the Pitt News by stating

,that A University Should be a

place where conflicting opinions

. are discussed rationally and open-

ly." It is precisely because this
is what a University should be that
ROTC has no place an academic

campus. Free intellectual ex-
change of ideas cannot exist in
courses whose faculty is selected
by and whose content is dictated
by the Defense Department.

If it is true that the University
has some degree of choice of
ROTC .faculty through the of-
fice of the chancellor, it is pro-

Student Analyses Merits of ROTC

Editor, The Pitt News,

The beginning of the fall term
has seen many attacks on the

—ROTC program on this cam-

pus. One of the major, and pos-
sibly only rational attack has
been concerning the academic
quality supposedly absent in R0-
TC courses.

Academic as defined in these
attacks, means a course of study
which has no outside control as to
what is taught. This definition it-

. self may be tenuous and should be

further substantiated with other
than Undergraduate opinion.

The critics of ROTC are able
to show thatthe books are print-
ed by the U. S. government and
the course of study is ‘defined by
requirements of the U.S. Army.
They however are not able to con-
clusively show control of ‘the
method of teaching and lack of

freedom of expression by student
and professors.

Whether the above control suf-
ficiently negates ROTC’s chances
of being academic is question-
able, but a larger problem arises
under this definition of academ-
K}.

For instance. aperson who is
majoring in Education in order
to teach. finds himself confront-
ed with requirements which set
certain standards and courses that
must be taken. In other words the
state in essence controls the
course taught in the Education
Department and specifies to a
large extent the type of books re-
quired and what must be taught.

The same problem confronts
every department that has by its
department head been required to
teach certain courses in certain
ways and with books approved by

that department head. These re-
quirements are essential for ac-
creditation and for certain con-
sistency in American Education as
a whole.

Without some standards relat-
ing to what is taught, how it is
taught and from what general
sources it is taught no BA de-
gree would mean the same thing
and none could be given any
weight until the particular schools
curriculum and thestudents teach-
ers had been examined. The result
then, of an argument based on this
definition of academic, could be
the exclusion of all the courses
taught at this university on the
grounds that they are unacademic.

~‘-:.€{Under the direction of Mr.
ohn Vrana, the University’s
of_ Student Affairs,
are formulating the

d on the hillside above the en-
 gineering complex.

 Vrana told The Pitt News
t he is acting as a coordin-
tor with the architectural firm
If Deeter, Ritchey, Sipple and

hysical plant staff, Department
’_50f Student Affairs, and Housing
7 Advisory Board. The Hous-
ng Advisory‘ Board consists of
-,.m‘ale and female students who
' ave been advising the Committee
on Cooperative Housing.

‘Up to this time, according

 Vrana, “Our planning has
been greatly dependent upon the
:students working with us. They
" have lived in the dormitories
{and know what housing is ‘like.
.Very broad opinions and ideas
;are represented in our program.
I urrent planning is committed
Jtothe concept of small, cooper-
've group living. The primary
'_'ving unit will consist of a suite
iffor six to eight students. Each
'-‘suite will have sleeping rooms,
jﬂa living room, a small kitchen-
5[ette_, and lavatory facilities.

PEACE CORPS

The Peace Corps has assigned
"a permanent representative to

  
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 

_ first time. His job is to establish
 ties with colleges and universi-
O ties in western Pennsylvania, and
 to increase Peace Corps involve-
. :ment in Pittsburgh.

‘ Fred W. Wallhausser, a gradu-
Late of the University has been
._n_amed to this position. He is a
 former Peace Corps volunteer in

The basic philosophy for a
suite system is based upon the
concept of freedom of expres-
sion. Residents will assign them-
selves to. rooms within a given
suite and will decide the func-
tions of the various rooms. For
example, the students could de-
cide whether the living room lS
to be used as a study room or
for study purposes. The Uni-
versity would not structure any-
thing larger than a suite, unlike
the Towers dormitory houses,
although suites could join togeth-
er for social functions if they
wanted. ‘

Vrana added that the dormi-
tories wll be “the residence
halls of the future. The Univer-

,.sity needs these dormitories to

increase enrollment in any sub-
stantial nature.” They will serve
the long-range needs of future
students. It is possible that the
dormitories will be an upperclass
residence hall, with occupancy
determined on a seniority basis-.

The only student planning at
this time has concerned the
suites. Vrana said that the stu-
dents will soon discuss common
areas, including mail rooms, and
eating facilitie_s_._ Within the next
few weeks the student program
will be presented to the Univer-
sity as a report, and if it is ap-
proved the architects will incor-
porate it into the actual dormi-
tory plans. ‘

Since it opened on Broadway
four years ago “Fiddler on the
Roof” has amassed a consider-
able amount of. reverence and le-
gend as “America’s most acclaim-
ed musical.” Pittsburgh finally has
its chance to lend its favor to the
cult. Here are some observations
on the Fiddler Company now at
the Nixon Theatre.

Fiddler on the Roof focuses on
a Jewish village in Czarist Rus-
sia. Even more particularily it ex-

amines Tevye the Milkman and
his family. At the beginning Te-
vye explains that they are all fid-
dlers on a roof trying to scratch
out a simple tune without losing
their balances. Tradition is what
saves them from falling and
throughout the show the villagers
act out their dependence on it.

But at the same time tradition
is breaking down. Tevye’s daugh-
ters marry for love and not by the
matches made for them. In the
middle of all of this is Tevye
and how he attempts to recon-
cile his cherished tradition with
progress. I

Fiddler on the Roof is a very
funny and very sad musical that
works on the theory that emotions
spring most deeply from the
edge of laughter. To succeed com-
edy must be played very careful-
l_y against sincere personal feel-
ings, but neither can dominate.

IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
DID YOU KNOW?

1. Garabage collection in
ghetto areas is often in-
adequate. Of an estimated 14,-
000 cases of Rat Bite in the U.
S. in 1965, most were in ghetto‘
neighborhoods.

2.Matemal mortality rates for
non-white mothers are 4 times
as high for those of white
mothers.

 ‘Pitt News’ Review

 Fiddleri Too Much Comedy

This is why the audience can at
one moment laugh at Tevye for
talking to God as he would to a
village crony and then the next
moment pity him as the man who
sees his world of solid tradition
falling down around him.

Unfortunately the company at
the Nixon lets itself be carried
away by comedy. Feelings are too
often stiffled with the result
that the audience is laughing
more at the characters than with
them. Tevye appears as a non-
chalant clown instead of the fa-
ther trying to keep his family to-
gether under his-"ideas.

The character of Tevye is cen-
tral to the interplay of laughter
and tears. Again the comedy is
too much. Paul Lipsom sounds
more like a peasant from the
Catskills than from the U-rals. He
is funny, but he lacks thedepth
that melts something prepost-

erous into something warm and .

sensitive. Mimi Randolph as his
wife Golde is strong and worth
many laughs. As the daughter who
leaves for Siberia to marry the
young intellectual she loves,
Barbara Coggin is extremely
charming. Her song. ‘__‘Far From
the Home I Love,” is the most
movingof the whole show.

Fiddler is based on the stories
of Sholom Aleichem, and Jo-
seph Stein has been 4-gfaithful ‘in
his adaptation of the folklore.
The humor, and customs of the
Russian Jews are preserved with
the sort of character that is dif-
ferent and yet familiar enough
to draw the laiighter of recogni-
tion.

The choreography of Jerome
Robbins is exceptionally clever
and fast. It is probably the high-
est point of the show. The staging
coupled; with the music of Jerry
Bock and Shelddn Harnick proves
to be a large part of the Fiddler
legend. Numbers like “Match-
maker, ,, Matchmaker,” “To
Life,” .“Wedding Dance,” and
the dream scene are examples of
the talent in the show.

“Appropriate,” though not a
forceful word, is probably the best
to describe the entire production.
Even the scenery is reminiscent
of Chagal’s paintings of Russian
rural life. For the most part Fed-

fim.

dler on the Roof remains con-
stant to its character. Only oc-
casionaly does it pause to flash a
smile to the lights and the brass
of the musical comedy idiom.

Potentially Fiddler on the Roof
lives up to its legend. It proves
that it has the book, the music,
and the staging to give it all
the personality and vibrance of a
great musical. Unfortunately the
company at the Nixon doesn’t
hold up quite as well.

Draft Labeled ‘Undemocratic’

(Crmtiru1e(lfroni /’a_1/K I)
however, Houston asserted that
he believed the draft to represent
a fundamental threat to one’s ex-
istence. “Draft resistance,” he
continued, “logically leads to re-
sistance of unjust authority in

general. The notion of resistance
becomes broader.”

Referring to the court room sit-
uation in which draft resisters are
tried for violation of the Selec-
tive Service Act. Houston com-
mented that “in just sitting there.
one can learn more about our so-
ciety in 20 minutes than in 20
years of experience elsewhere.
The judge and prosecutor have
simply lostftheir humanity."

In another interview Houston
summed up his position on the
draft saying.- “It is my belief that
all countries derive their powers
from the individuals who com-
pose them. The primary concern
of an individual is his own exis-
tence. Consequently. no govern-
ment or State has the right to de-
prive him of his existence with-
out his consent. As a system
which threatens the lives of in-
dividuals without their consent.
and often against their wills. the
draft is undemocratic.”

Following Prof. Houston’s re-

»marks, Chasan delivered his ad-

dress. “To me,” he began, “draft
resistance is, in essence, the mor-
al core of -the New Left. The
stakes are very high for one who
decides to res'st. Because of this,
the movement does not attract
great numbers of lackadaisical
participants.” Chasan explained
that those who decide to turn in
their draft cards do so only after
a considerable period of serious
deliberation and sincere intro-
spection. “The draft is unconsti-
.tutional and immoral,” he con-
tinued. “It is a crutch away from
the necessity to fall into the po-
litics of frustration.”

Justifying the dramatic act of
turning in one's draft card as a
valid means of resistance, Chasan
emphasized that “we’re dealing
with corporate liberals and be-
cause we‘re dealing with corpor-
ate liberals. we have to resist
openly and_ not underground."

Pittsburgh Area Resistance has
conducted several “draft card turn
in ceremonies in the past. The
latest such meeting took place
Nov. 14 of this year. At that time.

this reporter questioned Chasan
regarding the purpose of the cere-
monies. "I believe we are holding
this draft card turn in at the Uni-
versity." he answered. “because
the University plays an integral
role in buttressing American po-
litics of war and conscription. We
are particulary disturbed by the
institution of student deferment
which enables relatively rich and
‘motivated’ young men to opt out
on the decisions of life and death
which should affect us all.”

ROTC ACCREDITATION

Ken Scheuler, SG president,
presented his official stand on
the accreditation of ROTC on the
campus at the Faculty Senate
meeting last Thursday. He re-
ferred to a bill passed the night
before by SG' which objected to
the current status of ROTC and
urged the removal of academic
credit.

The SG resolutioncndorsed the
position of the other groups at
the University which have taken
the same stance.

“The real import of this res-
olution lies inythe realization that
to take, it’s present structure and

inconsistent with the notion of
an academic field of study, aca-

philosophies of a Liberal Arts ed-
ucation.” . -

   Grid Program Decision

9 Rests With Chancellor

 A S by Roy Jacobs
9 ' Sport Editor

A huge sigh of relief fell over campus Saturday night. At
last the football season was over. But for many people. there’s
still a tension in’the air.

There are rumors in the air,itoo: rumors that Dave Hart
_is gone, rumors that Frank Carver is gone, rumors that Dave
_Hart is taking over, Frank Carver’s job. The only thing that can
-be said for sure is that the wilder the rumor, the less the
perpetrator knows about the whole situation.

At this point, although the Athletic Com-
mittee is meeting today, it looks like one man
is going to make any decisions that are going
to ‘be made. Chancellor Posvar has been look-
ing into the problems for a couple weeks now,
"and sometime this week or early next week
some type of announcement should be com-
ing forth from his office.

’ Hopefully, the decision will be more
thanjust a personnel change. Hopefully, the
Chancellor has gotten some good advice and
will initiate some program changes.

‘ After Saturday’s game, in the lockerroom Hart didn’t
look quite so beaten as he has after other losses this year.
. Maybe this time he was better prepared to lose. More likely,

-he had passed the point of suffering. At last the season was
over, but he found talk about the future surprisingly easy.

' “Maybe I’m stupid, or even-optimistic,” he said, “but I
think there’ll be some changes made in the program.” But he
- added, “Everybody knows what’s wrong. There’s no use going
~intoit.»” ’ 1
True, everybody knows there’s something wrong, but so far,
..too many people haven’t tried to do anything about it. That’s
why the Chancellor needs to do something more constructive
- V that just making a personnel change.

If not, there’re some football players that’ll leave school.
Others might just quit football and complete their education.
at Pitt. Also, there are certain alumni, who are very close to
the situation and who donate a good deal of their own time‘
as well as money to football, who might just turn their backs
. next year if no basic changes are made. ‘

. JACOBS,

  
   

. _ ‘It’s not going to be an easy decision for the Chancellor.

- ‘Dave Hart and Frank‘ Carver are nice guys, but their abilit-
ies have been questioned. The program needs serious upgrad-
ing. But faculty pressure on the Chancellor not to change is
also great.

If nothing is done in the next week and a half, then noth-
ing anybody ever does or says is going to bring a winning tra-
dition back to Pitt football. Indeed, the inactivity in regards
. the football situation has some of the athletes in other sports
. »-vgrumbling also.

  
 
 

feeling of foolishness for believing any of the pre-season opti-
mism. Yet, this writer can’t help feeling it might’ve been dif-
ferent with a betterbreak early in the season.

Instead, the Panthers went 1-9. The blame can be traced
 to the coaches, to the players, to the injuries, to the schedule.
'. But what about the subtle causes: no training table, poor
practice facilities, no freshman program, a stingy business

 

 
  
 
    
  
 
 
 
 
  

what subconscious effect this can have on the players or
coaches. It merely perpetuates a losing syndrome.

, , It’s going to be a long week of waiting for the entire
Athletic Department. Dave Hart seems fairly sure he’ll stay
here, and his outlook- is brightened by incidents similar to one
that happened in the lockerroom after the game.

Two potential recruits from Bordentown approached him
,,b.e"fore';1eaving after watching the 65-9 loss and said they were
 definitely coming to Pitt next year. “It looks like you need

School Marks In Loss

by ART ROSENGARTEN

At 4:05- Saturday afternoon, the final nail was strongly
"hammered into the Pitt football coffin. The Nittany Lions of
Penn State delivered the final blow, stomping over the Pan-

thers 65-9.

“Thank God it’s over,” said athletic Director Frank Carver, as he
silently watched the remnants of the 31,224 people who paid to see Pitt
suffer its ninth defeat, file silently out of Pitt Stadium. -

“We’re not a 1-9 team,” said
head coach Dave Hart thought-
fully. “We’re not a team that
should lose by 65-9. ”

“I thought we went out there
with the best we had,” continued
Hart. “I know that we're not a
Penn State, but I thought we had
a chance, but we never retained
any momentum.”

Skip Keeps Hopes High
by MARTHA HARTLE
His team lost by 56 points, yet he was voted the most

Skip Orszulak closed out his career with the Panthers in re-
cord-breaking style Saturday, catching 16 passes for 158 yards. The
split end from West Mifflin won the Coogan Award for his perfor-
» mance and his 16 receptions shattered two of Bob Longo’s records. A

season all-star games, and hein-
dicated-that his performance Sa-
turday could be a factor in the sel-
ection. But more important to Skip
than a post-season game is apro-
fessional career. He definitely
plans to play pro ball.

For a “most outstanding play-
er” both on and off the field,
Skip’s football career may have
just begun.

SKIP ORSZULAK (80) was the only bright-

Hart, who is a firm believerﬁﬁgii

that the team that has the forward
momentum is going to the win-
ner, thought that the Panthers were
beginning to pick up some mom-
entum in the first quarter.

In that first quarter the Panthers
took the opening kick-off and
moved the ball in six plays from
their 31 to the Lions’ 13. The high-
light of the drive was a 43-yard
pass play from quarterback Dave
Havern to split end Skip Orszulak.

At the 13, the drive ran out of
gas when Havern, being pressur-
ed by State’s strong defensive
rush, lofted a ball into the end-
zone intended for Joe McCain.

,Penn State’s Mike Smith out-
‘leaped McCain and intercepted t‘

ball to end the drive.

Following the interception,
State took the ball and traveled 74-
yards to the Pitt six, where Bob
Garthwaite kicked ’a field goal

and put the Lions in the lead 3-0.

J. D. Lewis returned the ensuing
kick-off to the Pitt 42, where
Havern, Orszulak, and Denny Fer-
ris moved the ball to the Lion 16.
With a fourth down and 6 situa-
tion, Joe McCain converted a 33-
yard field goal to tie the score
at 3-3.

State as the momentum switched.
The Lions could do no wrong; the
Panthers could do no right. By the
time the gun for the half sounded,
Penn State had run-up command-
ing 45-9 lead, V

The only touchdown of the
game for the Panthers was scored
on a‘ two-yard plunge by full-
back Tony Esposito, capping a
second quarter 70-yard march.

yards rushing as the Panthers lost
a total of 74 yards. Of those 74,
55 were lost by Havern as he scram-
bled for his l_ife in the face of
State’s powerful pass rush. ‘

Havern managed to set two»
school records by throwing 51 pas-
ses and completing 29. Havern’s
favorite target, Orszulak, the

game’s outstanding player, caught
16 passes for 158 yards and also
set two records. ’ ‘

said that “a lot of people didn’t

Kociubes then charged that La

‘Pietra had overlooked the central

issue inr the ROTC controversy,
control of the program by the De-

, partment of .Defense. He noted

that by law and contract, the De-

'fense Department regulates the

program and that the University
must comply with its decisions.

Continuing his attack on th e V
_ program, K 0 c i u b e s questioned

whether the courses could be aca-
demically justified. He said that
even upper level courses teach
what amounts to battle tactics
and asked, “Is this consistent with
an academic program?” Referring
to La Pietra’s final point, Schuel-
er said that ‘-‘problem analysis
and decision - making c a n 1 b e

learned in a brick laying course.”

Dave Ehrenwerth resumed the
defense of ROTC by saying that
he wanted to state the “facts”
rather than “take things out of
context as the oppossition has
done”;

Undertaking the .issue of who
controls the ROTC program, he
stated that the Chancellor and the
Secreta-ry of .. the University re-
view and select all ROTC fac-
ulty members. Further, Ehren-

; worth noted that the Chancellor

can not only remove ROTC fac-
ulty at_any time, but also request
that specific officers be placed

‘on the faculty. He added that the

Chancellor and the University,
not the Defense Department, de-
termine how much credit ROTC
courses will receive.

Referring to Schueler’s charge

Ehrenwerth noted, “More people

Ehrenwerth concluded with a

reminder that the University re-H»,
quested that the ROTC program

Kociubes a n s w e r e d Ehren-

section he cited requires .that
