 Ilte Party Bays

During last year’s student election campaign, too much
- subterfuge was present in the political parties.
Such parties were in the open, yet did not admit what
they stood for. One was called the All—Campus Party and
represented only the fraternity interests.

This party was foisted off on the partially unsuspecting
student body as representing them, when it actually rep-
resented a scant 15% of them;

« The other party was called the All—University Party and
was characteristically independent although they supported
some fraternity candidates on the All—Campus ticket.

This party, too, was not competely sincere in their pub-
. licity propaganda; and no one knew exactly what the goings-
on were except for people directly involved.
Something is basically wrong in» a chaotic situation of
this ‘sort andlcertainly does not encourage a total University
vote for which we supposedly strive. T . '

If a party is the fraternity party, let it call itself so. This‘

party has an assured_1,000 votes and the students should
know what‘ they’re bucking.

This year many strong candidates are available for the

important positions, some with fraternity attachment, others
;with none.
 Perhaps the parties might organize this year onthe
iidealistic, yet realistic basis, of quality in leadership, qual-
iﬁed-candidates rather than prior political attachment.
Platforms and campaign meetings of the individual
parties should be open. All partiesishould be announced.
Sincerity and candor should pervail in all the groups.
Only then can we expect a good, fair ﬁght for the ofﬁces

T ‘to be had. Only then will the best man win, provided a rep-'

resentative vote is cast. _ _

if Getting Out The Vote

If Wednesday’s vote for acceptance or rejection of the
Student Congress—passed Student Government Association
constitution follows the pattern of past all-student voting,
the proposed plan .will be decided upon by a handful of
University men and’ women. _, _ i

Possibly 500 or so students will relinquish the few min-
:-,utes it will take to vote one way or the other on the plan.
This is a slightpercentage of the total number of the student

‘A body, but nevertheless this number will say whether two
years of planning and work will be endorsed or thrown out.
A e The others, or so they will say, don’t care about student
government, so ‘why should they vote? V . e ‘
But afterwards, maybe one or two semesters later, those

who pass up the Wednesday vote will complain——if it is de-
feated -they will _say theschool needs such a plan or vice
T versa. v , - _ .
 The proposed constitution deserves a large vote, no"
“matter how the ﬁnal tallyturns out. All students, both un-
dergraduate and graduates in all parts of the University,
, should take the time to read once again the complete con-

' stitution and decide if this is the form of government need-

ed here. . _ .

Then thg only thing left to do is pick up a ballot Wed-
nesday between 11:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. and mark on it
"‘yes’f_ or f‘no.” ,

._ Education In Transition .. 

   

Athletics On Campus

(Editor’s note: This is the last in the series of
column on contemporary education at the Uni-
versity.) ' A

” -‘By David Breakstone

Mighty Sport, comes at last, the earth shaking
with his strides. ‘ ’

K The most publicized of all University activity is
athletics.» Academic and extra-curricular life may
play a largerrole in molding the individual, but
the athletes ‘get the school into the headlines.‘ And
rightly so, as the ancient Greeks would contend;
for the making of at man combines both mental
,-_and physical conditioning.
What exactly is the Univer-
sity doing athletically to ‘pro-
mote this “classical education?”
Under7 the supervision of
Capt. Tom Hamilton, We en-
gage in 13 intercollegiate sports,
from football to squash. On the
intramural basis nearly 20 sports
have varying numbers of partic-
ipants. at
it Football is haturally the
keystone ’ of the athletic arch,
and upon its fortunes the rest of the program de-
pends. With the knowledgeable guidance of John
Michelosen, the footballers have come back into
the “big time.” P
The reason for the Goliathan proportions of foot-
ball is an economic one. The “take” from a 10 game
schedule must cover substantially the cost of the
rest of the sports activities, which don’t pay for
themselves. Football is a commercial necessity, but
its very commerciality is a paradox.
The emphasis must be placed upon winning, at
almost all costs because the customers pay only to

_ see a winner. The successful team in the big time

is composed of top-notch players, painstakingly
recruited from the high schools. ‘ ’

It isn’t uncommon today for an excellent scho-

V lastic back to get 40 to 50 scholarship offers from

all the country. This marketein players has‘ be-
come infamous but must be endured, if a college
chooses to ,stay on top.
Leaders Seen Lacking A »
The Panther team is an all—scholarship com-
munity. The players realize their responsibility to
, perform and usually give it _all they have. But in
the pressure of the modern game this often isn’t
enough. Last season for example, their 4-6 record
was an object of ridicule and criticism.
V After losing decisively‘ to Oklahoma in the
opener-, the customers wanted Michesolen,run out

on a rail and the entire team reshuﬁied. The *sea- ’

son proved to be somewhat of a disappointment,
‘ victory-wise, but it might have gone the other way
if the team had had a bona-_-ﬁde,etake—charge leader.
As a sidelight, the case of the University football
player is an interesting one. Following the national
attitude, the local gridder is" no" longer a campus

- hero.

.. On the contrary, he is often viewed by his

A Strong Constitution‘ . 

 

fellmv ‘ students with sympathy and occasional
humor. Everyone realizes the contractual rela.
tionship of the athlete to the athletic department
and knows the huge demands made of the player
in the fall.

In addition, the privileges accorded the players
make the players appear strange creatures in the
traditional college atmosphere. ~- . '

The players, all year round, have become rela-
tively isolated. They live together, wear the com-
mon uniform, and share the unique problems of
the caste.’ They have fallen from campus grace and

-will not become an integral part of the school un-
‘ less they want to be. I
The University has chosen the “high road” of,

the football big time for the past three years. It is
not clear.whether this policy will continue in the
future. The athletic department has been notori-
ously cryptic in enunciating its future plans for
any ‘sport, but it may soon have to be.

The trimester proposal would wreck havoc on
University‘ athletics. tWith its juggled calendar,
the trimester would put students through in 2 and
5%, years. College athletics is based on the four
year program.

Policy Needed in Sports

Even by keeping athletes out of school every

third trimester (similar to the practice which now

keeps footballers in school for ﬁve years), spring
sports would be impaired by the spring-summer

'.break occurring in April

When the athletic department is forced to take
a stand on the proposal, a concrete all-sportsdpolicy
will be presented which can go far to clear the air
concerning where we are going athletically. X

The present program is generally diverse and
energetic. Thé so-called minor sports (thdse other
than football and’ basketball) are true examples
of. college athletics. They invite general student
participation and are not restricted to the scholar-
ship plan. C ,

The coaching staff is of high calibre and inspires
conﬁdence, despite‘ frequent public cries for the
necks of the basketball and football coaches.

The facilities for physical education are good, but
need proposed enlargements to enable a far larger
portion of the student body to participate. ' A

The Memorial Field House was obsolete even-
before completion and the expansion on the hill
will relieve overcrowded conditions. ’

The argument for big—time college athletics, par-,

professional standards is indistinct, land is blurred

’ further by secrecy. , , ,  _-
‘It is obviousthat’ an end to _hypocris‘y“ can be
‘effected only by frank evaluation of whatfth,e goals A
of college, sports are and what means must be em-
».,_ploy_ed to attain those goals. K "

‘The conclusion reached by such consideration
should be that amateurism must be reinforced at

, any cost. The preservation of any professional stan-

dards can only further downgrade thedcharacter
of college sport. " —‘ ’

It looks as if Krupnik has ﬁnally lost out in this area to the ﬁeld

of athletics. Most of the talk around the campus and community is
about the professional use of Pitt Stadium and the NCAA bid that

the Panthers have received and accepted.   Pin-‘fab

Looking over the topic of Professional use of the Stadium, both
sides of the story have good arguments without a doubt. But, only

‘one side can win out. Undoubtedly, it will be the side that the Chan- - and 
cellor is on.

Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld, in his short time at Pitt, is fol-
lowing a similar policy of making this University one of the best,
academically, in the nation. He is doing so by formulating Academic
Policy to ﬁt the situation here and not what one other university is
using and taking a chance that it may or may notwork.
