NOW boycotts    
Domino's Pizza  

By Jim Tezak ,
Asst. News Editor

The National Organization
for Women is organizing a na-
tionwide boycott of Domino’s
Pizza, claiming _owner Tom
Monahan is ﬁnancially support-
ing anti-abortion organizations.

According to Jeanne Clark,
the NOW national chair for re-
productive rights, Monahan is
taking money “out of corporate
coffers” to ﬁnance organizations
such as Operation Rescue, which
she said is “a group that uses
racketeering and terroristic tac-

tics _to'_c1ose5down abortion clin-i"

ics.
“We believe people shouldn’t

be eating [at] a place that doesn’t'

support women’s rights and
women’s right to life,” Clark said.
Ron Hingst, the National Di-

rector of Public Relations for.

Domino’s Pizza, Inc., said that al-
legations that either Domino’s
Pizza or Domino’s Farms, the
parent company, made donations
to anti-abortion groups are “to-
tally untrue.”

Hingst did admit that in No-
vember 1988, Monahan, whose
company is based in-Detroit, per-

sonally donated $50,000 to the T

Committee to End State-Funded
Abortions in Michigan.

Clark declined to reveal her

Hingst addedthat he felta

Gorbachev's China visit draws 300,000 protesters

BEIJING (AP) ——More than
300,000 people jammed ‘into
Tiananmen Square yesterday to
protest China’s autocratic system
and show support for students
on a four-day-old hunger strike
in the biggest challenge to the
government in decades.

As China’s leaders held a
historic summit with Soviet Presi-
dent Mikhail S. Gorbachev inside
the Great Hall of the People,
protesters surged onto its steps
and turned the adjoining l()()-
acre square into a vast parade
ground. Hundreds of police and
soldiers guarded the hall’s en-
trances but no police were seen
in the square.

The month-old student
movement for democratic reform
has been transformed into a mass
movement as teachers, doctors,
reporters, government workers
and ordinary workers who previ-
ously cheered from the sidelines
took up banners and marched.

Not since the 1966-76 leftist

Cultural Revolution, when youth
mobilized by revolutionary leader
Mao Tse-tung ousted alleged
rightist officials, has there been
such a mass challenge to China’s
communist establishment.

“We cannot fail to come out
at such a critical moment. We
can’t let the students starve to
death and not support them,”
said a Qinghua University teacher.

“If (the leaders) fear the
people, they can’t represent
them,” said another teacher at the
Workers’ Movement Institute.

5. Korea to increase
funds for US. troops

SEX)! ,'l., SOUTH KOREA (AP)
—- The government will bow to

- \\’~'ashington’s demands and spend

more to maintain U.S. troops in
South Korea, it was reported
Tuesdrty.

In a plan submitted to the
National Assembly, the govern-
ment said the country will gradu-
ally pay more, but Washington

should consider Seoul’s already
heavy defense burden, which is
equivalent to 6 percent of the
gross national product, accord-
ing to the Yonhap News Agency.

Washington, citing the strong
economy, has requested that
Seoul contribute more to the cost
of maintaining U.S. troops in
South Korea.

Gorbachev called
Drugstore Cowboy

WASHINGTON (AP) —— The
White House said yesterday it
was “very leery” of a promised
halt in Soviet weapons shipments
to Nicaragua and accused Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
of acting like a “drugstore cow-
boy” offering one arms control
proposal after another.

 

Presidential spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater confirmed that
Gorbachev had privately told the
United States that Moscow was
stopping its arms shipments to
the leftist Sandinista government
in Managua.

However, he said there was
no evidence of any cutoff and
that military supplies were still
going into Nicaragua. i I

On the other hand, Fitzwater
said the weapons being received
now might simply have been in
the pipeline when Gorbachev
made his promise or might be
coming in from another country,
such as Cuba.

HE DEAD  MILKM

By Joan Kane
Staff Writer

The Dead Milkmen don’t like
much of anything. They didn’t
like their dinner. They don’t
particularly like beer. They’re
bored by talking about music
and they’re sick to death of tour-
ing.

Monday night’s Pittsburgh
show was the final stop on their
latest tour, and the numerous
months on the road have taken

their toll on the band. Still, the '

at

band, who won’t divulge their
real names, managed to spit out
one more interview.

Led by boisterous Rodney
Anonymous (vocals), the Dead
Milkmen are as loud, obnoxious
and unseemingly likable in per-
son as they are on stage and
g vinyl. Anonymous and fellow

Milkmen Jasper Th read/Joe Jack
Talcum (guitar), Lord Maniac/
Dave Blood (bass) and Dean
Clean (drums) are glad to be
finished with this tour.

“We’re trying to work out a
thing where we can send a bunch
of other people on the road. We
like touring the first day. See, one

iof my toys broke, and it’s just not
the same,” Maniac explained.

According to the_ band, the
high point of the tour was their
visit to Hawaii.

“I boogie boarded. I got a
tan, but -when I got back to the
states, I showered, and I lost it,”
Anonymous joked.

“We went to the island where
the volcanoes were and smelt it,”

At this point, to emphasize

Musically, the band doesn’t
have much to say for themselves.

“I have nothing to do with

“We consciously try to stay

mous said.

want society to stay fairly compe-
tent, they should keep buying
our records,” Anonymous ex-
plained.

In his usual, forced serious
vein, Anonymous discussed the
hardships of being a rock star.

“Being in a band is a twenty-
four hour a day job. You have to
be cool all of the time. Ifyou trip
over something, you have to make
it look like you meant to trip over
it. You have to make your band
look cool all the time.

“We want to trash our popu-
larity. We should become even
more popular, then when we
trash it, people will say ‘Wow,
that’s so cool. They were so

popular, and then they trashed
it,’ “ he said.. '

The Dead Milkmen are full
of peculiar musings. They be-
lieve that they formed in layers
during the Mesozoic age. They
prefer to use only blue toilet
paper. They insist that vampires
really do exist, and as Anony-
mous eloquently put it, “Art is the
absence of work.”

“Hanging out is an art, if you
can make money from it,” Ma-
niac said. “It’s not what you do,
it’s the way you do it. You have
to constantlyfind new ways of
doing nothing.”

“Hanging out is like waiting
‘for Godot,” Thread said.

Stringent measures needed
to stop crime and criminals

. Crime is a problem. livery day, it becomes more and
more a factor in our everyday lives. In New York, a violent
crime wave is sweeping the city; Washington, capital of
our country, leads the nation in murders. Miami is famous
for its drug trade. It is time for some strong measures to
be taken to prevent crime and enforce existing laws. For
all of the imperfections of the present administration,
Bush has recognized the need for action in this area.

In recent days, there have been a few opinions
expressed on these subjects.

The Bush administration has released a proposal for
a $1.2 billion anti-crime program. The proposal includes
some of the following provisions:
1. A ban on the import of semiautomatic weapons and on
the sale of semiautomatic ammunition clips of more than
15 shots.
2. A 10-year minimum sentence on crimes relating to the
use of semiautomatic weapons.
3. $1 billion in prison construction.
4. A broader use of the death penalty.
5. Expansion of federal law enforcement staff and federal
prosecutors’ offices.
6. Further limits on firearms sale to those convicted of
violent crimes.

In other crime-related news, the Supreme Court
further restricted the rights of prisoners by allowing
prison officials to censor prisoners’ reading material and
keep a tighter control on who can visit them.

Prison isn’t meant to be a vacation; it is specifically
intended to restrict the rights of those who have not
respected the rights of others. And the proposed meas-
ures by the administration show an intention to try to
prevent crime and better enforce the law when it is

. broken. All these things point to an overall crackdown on

crime in America, and while crime will not disappear
because of these measures, at least our lives will be just
a little bit safer because of them.

The last column about Col. Ollie North

Now that the debate over
whether or not Lt._ Col. Oliver
North was guilty of.the diversion
of funds from Iranian arms sales
to the Nicaraguan freedom—ﬁght-
ing guerrillas‘ has been resolved
with a guilty verdict (he was
acquitted of this charge, but found
guilty of aiding and abetting in
obstructing Congress), a new
debate has surfaced: , Should
President Reagan have pardoned
North? Yes, of course. National
heroes shouldn’t be tried and
treated as criminals. However,
I’m afraid it’s not that simple.

Reagan couldn’t have par-
doned North due to reasons far
more complex than simple inno-
cence or guilt.

 

First of all, Reagan has al-
ways been a strong advocate of
laws and traditions created and
preserved by the Constitution —
a man is innocent until proven
guilty. For the former president
to revoke this strict moral belief
would not only have been very
unorthodox for himself, but
would have presented a bad

‘ example for future leaders of the

United States.

Additionally, although the
president has the authority to
pardon an untried man, his deci-
sion could have ignited a melee

between the legislative and ex-
ecutive branches of the United
States. This would have resulted
in an ugly scar, masking the
successes of the Reagan admini-
stration. ‘
Furthermore, and unfortu-
nately the most important point,
this was a political trial. IfReagan
had offered a pardon to North, it
would have appeared as if the

former president were trying to _

hide something that could have
come out in the trial. (Why does
everybody forget that Ed Meese
and Reagan were the ones who
originally told the country about
the “diversion”?) Not only would
this have cast an ugly shadow
over the Reagan administration,
but it may have given the Demo-
crats enough negative propa-
ganda to defeat George Bush in
the election. . ,

The changing of the guard
brings a new face to this nasty

affair: President Bush. And now

the new question: should Presi-
dent Bush pardon North? Well,
this time the situation "is different
—— North has been tried and
convicted on three counts. Does
this make Bush’s decision easier

than Reagan's? No, The conse— ‘

quences of a pardon are still
quite similar. However, Bush has
a two—sided trump card: one side
has the face of North's excellent
lawyer, Brendan Sullivan, and
the other shows the dedicated
patriot, North. ,

It might be best for Bush to

let Brendan Sullivan keep ap-
pealing until the charges are
dropped. This could very possi-
bly happen. If this does occur,
then Bush and Reagan can joy-
fully declare that the system works
— innocent men don’t need to be
pardoned. _ I

On the.other hand, North is
a dedicated Marine. He’s a loyal
servant to the ‘commander-ins-

chief. The colonel himself would i

probably tell you up-front that
he’s willing to endure a treacher-
ous trial with future appeals if the
president deems it necessary.

Ultimately, the congressional _

Democrats are the ones who have

failed. Due to their ban on Contra‘

aid, it took covert action by North
to keep the rebels ‘alive long
enough to force the, Sandinistas
to call for free elections in 1990.
These elections might never have
occurred if the Contras had been

forced to surrender because of .
, the ban of U.S. funds by Con-

gress. Ironically, it’s the Bush and
Reagan administrations that are
being tarred and feathered, not
Congress. - _
Mark Twain once said that

there is no distinctively native V

American criminal class except
Congress. Now I'm not calling
anyone in Congress a criminal,
but maybe the pardon should be
coming from the House of Repre-
sentatives, not the president. ’

Paul Kengor is a columnist
for The Pitt News.

The greenhouse effect is more dangerous than the government claims  

   

Campaign promises, who
keeps them? Apparently not
President Bush.

After basing his campaign on
his desire to work for a clean
environment, President Bush has
now been accused of mu’/5/.ling
Dr. James I-Iansen, head of God-
dard Institute for Space Studies in
New York City. Hansen was
consulted by the Bush admini-
stration about the effects of global

, was changed in a report by the

ual warming ofthe earth’s atmos-
phere is mainly due to the use of
fossil fuels and may lead to seri-
ous drought, crop losses and
severe storms and floods.

The Bush administration,
however, has chosen to take a
more “optimistic” view of the
potential hazards of the green-
house effect. _ They claim that
there is a lack of evidence to
support Hansen’s projections.

In 1987, Hansen’s opinion was

Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn.,
has sided with Hansen and
charged that the White House is
guilty of “scientific fraud,” saying
they are “scared of the truth.”

George Bush: Is he a deceptive man or just plain dumb?

President Bush must be a
friend ofthe common people. He
recently proclaimed National
Volunteer Week, expressing his
deepest satisfaction with what
this nation’s volunteer corps had
done in administering effectively
to the United States’ most persis-
tent problems such as homeless-
ness, poverty and drug recovery.
This bold proclamation follows
upon the heels of George’s al-
ready well-publicized presiden-
tial theme of this nation being
guided by “a thousand points of
light,” referring to the rich na-
tional network of community
groups and organizations doing

their utmost to lend support serv- '

ices for a plethora of problems.
What a joy to see the president of
the United States acknowledging
the efforts of the innumerable,
largely invisible agents sacrific-
in-ggtheir time, energy and re-
sources, who go mostly unno-
ticed, while their efforts continue
to be the patriotic glue that holds
this nation together. Right?

Wrong.

Unfortunately, this recent
“don’t worry, be happy” attitude
toward present national concerns
dangerously obscures the story

ofthe real crisis in America, along
with George Bush’s increasingly
marginal role as president in
dealing with those concerns. For
while President Bush is out con-
gratulating all of those self-sacri-
ficin g true Americans with horns,
whistles and a national week
proclamation, he is guiding this
country’s domestic policies into
an America which is far from
kind and gentle. One would think
that if President Bush realized
that this nation’s volunteer or-
ganization structure was so suc-
cessful at handling our most dif-
ficult social problems, then he
would do something to make it
stronger. Surprise: President
Bush’s final budget includes $22

billion more in social program

 

cuts, programs which would have

gone to help those self-sacriﬁc-
ing Americans out there, already
up to their necks in self-sacrifice.

So what does this say about
Republican tenure? More cor-

rectly, what does this say about
President Bush? If anything, the
impression is this: While he has
been able to maintain Reagan’s
supply-side growth machine, he,
as Reagan before him, has been
able to do it successfully by si-
phoning off huge amounts of
cash from social programs and
injecting them into more lucra-
tive opportunities for the upper
classes, such as overgenerous tax
cuts and burgeoning military
expenditures. Luckily, and this
can be inferred from Bush’s
smarmy admiration, the nation’s
emergent volunteer contingent
has dealt somewhat effectively
with those problems consciously
neglected by the Republicans,
and here’s the punch line— at an
unbelievably low cost.

For all of Bush’s patriotic
gushing, Americans should hope
that his sincerity has some intel-
lectual depth. It should not be a
surprise to see that our commu-
nity-based voluntary organization
network has tackled this nation's
most persistent social problems
with relative success: not only
have these innumerable, ongo-
ing efforts stemmed the increas-

ing tide of poverty, despair and
hopelessness, but they have more
crucially prevented our society
from bottoming out. Underfu nded
and understaffed, these volun-
tary networks represent a prO~
gressive approach to solving this
nation’s structural social deficien-
cies, a viable alternative to the
entropic bureaucracies we have
at present. What they need is not
more of us to volunteer, but more
money;

The real question to ask is
this: Will President Bush be able
to acknowledge the
true value of this machinery and
have the gumption to work for it,
to give these groups the funding
they need? Or does his acclaim
for the 1000 points of light reﬂect
‘enlightened observation, or is it
really an attempt at appeasement
(masked as gratitude)? All ques-
tions about his sincerity and policy

intelligence aside, the very fact’

that we have to ask the question
should be troubling. What is so
dangerous about this perceived
uncertainty of President Bush’s
character and motives is that we

don’t have any reasonable sense I

of his accountability (did some-.

of the most despised characters
in British folklore.

in which he was referred to as

Unfortunately, this book is as
historical as the Fleet Street tab-

the royal family today. By the
time Geoffrey was writing,
Arthur’s legend as Britainfs great-

decided that no one would be-

of the grave grade injustice that

Sadly, quite frankly, more
often than not, if you are a con-
scientious student, the answer to
this question is, yes — your
undeserved grade is the result of
a poor evaluation by your in-
structor. And what a shame. If
only teachers everywhere were
to adopt the grading technique of
Professor Randi Koeske, then
there would be no caterwauling
over grades.

Mordred’s character into Arthur’s

Mordred had usurped the throne
from Arthur and then stabbed
Arthur in the back. Pretty nasty.

This created a trend. Later
writers made Mordred more and
more cowardly, more deceitful,
hated by all the/other knights,
and finally one writer started the
rumor that Mordred was the
product of an incestuous rela-
tionship between Arthur and his
sister, Morgana Le Fey. Well, -that
was about the end for poor

Mordred. If you have ever seen ’

the Arthurian ﬁlm Excalibur; then
you have seen the brutal and

’ unkind effects of rumor-mong-

To make a long story short;
If you accumulate 300 to 325
points, then you earn an “A.” 265
to 300 points earn a “B.” 215 to
265 points earn a “C.” 180 to 215
earn a “D.” Below 180 points is
an “F.” Points are accumulated
by: completing at least three
essays on assigned readings, tests
(midterm and final), attending
movies and attending and par-
ticipating in class.

The beauty of this approach
is two-fold. Regardless of your
strength as a student (i .e., whether
you're better at taking tests or
whether you excel at writing
papers) you have the opportu-
nity to achieve the grade you
desire. The number of essays
you can do, and consequently,
the points derived from them, are
limitless. In addition, Dr. Koeske’s

Two Panthers qualify for IC4A track meet

By Kent Hulnick
For The Pitt News

Although the conditions were
more appropriate for a football
game in late fall, Pitt’s men’s
track team hosted theJ9th an-
nual John Woodruff Invitational
Track and Field Meet last Satur-
day. ’

The cold and rainy weather
was nothing new to the Panthers.
“We haven’t been to one meet all
year where the weather has been
good,” said Pitt Coach John
Vasvary.

The fact that the weather
has been bad all year may be the
reason why more Panthers have-
n’t qualified for the post-season
meets, such as the IC4A, and the
NCAA.

“This type of weather is det-
rimental to running the fast times
that you need to in order to
qualify,” added Vasvary.

Pitt did, however, have two
runners qualify for the IC4A meet
on Saturday. Brett Shields quali-
fied for the IC4A meet in the 110-
meter high hurdles with a time of
14.24, good enough for second

place on Saturday. Also qualify-
ing was Keith Dowling, who
covered the 5,000-meter course
in 14:23.4, good for second place.

Several other Panthers are
on the verge of qualifying. Dave
Moore won the John Woodruff
800-meter run in a time of 1:512,
but missed qualifying by .4 of a
second. ‘

“Elbert Ellis and Dave Price
are definitely capable of qualify-
ing for nationals, given the op-
portunity,” said Vasvary.

That opportunity could be a
day with good conditions, ac-

cording to Vasvary.

Some of Pitt’s top runners
did not compete because they
competed in the Big East Meet
last weekend and will compete
in the IC4A Meet next weekend.
Of these, the most notable is All-
American sprinter/hurdler Eric
Cannon.

Mike Stratos, who won the
javelin event at the Big East Meet,
repeated the feat Saturday, with a
throw of 176 feet, 6 inches.

In the 10,000—meter run, Eric
Downer took third place in a

time of 31:39.0. In the same race,
Jim Hamilton finished sixth
63:09.8).

In the 100 meters, Sam Rice
took third (10.74) and Lindsey
Maxwell sixth (11.1). In the 400
meters, Chop Burton was second
(49.1), Neil Malobicky third (49.4),
Dave Price, fifth (51.9).

In the 800, Maurice Walcott
complimented Dave Moore’s
victory with a ninth-place finish
(1:57.1), and ‘Paul Friedrich fin-
ished eleventh (159.0).

Washington have been put on
academic suspension and will be
ineligible to play in the 1989

Their suspension comes one
semester after Dickerson’s
backup, Larry Wanke, transferred
to play football at a Division III
school. This leaves Pitt without
an experienced quarterback to
replace Dickerson.

Freshman Alex Van Pelt and
junior college transfer Scott Stark
are the most likely candidates to
take over. Neither has thrown a
pass for the Panthers yet.

Dickerson, who only started
one full year at quarterback for
Pitt, was already ninth on Pitt’s
all-time passing list with 1,974
yards. He was also Pitt’s second-
leading rusher last year with 555

Shorter striving for improvement

By Matt Martin
Editor in Chief

Read Brian Shorter’s biogra-
phy in last season’s Pitt basket-
ball media guide, and you’ll see
“To work with kids and do rec-
reational work” as the goals of
the talented junior forward.

But what is recreation to
others is hard work to Shorter,
who last summer added 13
pounds and cut his body fat by 5
percent by working out at the
Fitzgerald Field House weight
room.

His work paid off once the
basketball season began, par-
ticularly the Big East regular
season. In possibly the most
demanding and rugged league
in the nation, Shorter was named
the Newcomer of the Year and
averaged 20 points and 10 re-
bounds for the 17-13 Panthers.

With his first college season
behind him and another less than
six months away, Shorter is again
hard at work’ in the confines of
the Field House.

A ‘‘I’m doing the same things,”
' said Shorter, “lifting weights and

   

foot speed. I’m trying to improve
on what I did last summer, but it’s
getting harder. I’m moving up on
the weights."

Pitt strength and condition-
ing coach Ray Oliver said the 6-
foot-6, 229 pound Shorter works
out on the Nautilus equipment in
the weight room for approxi-
mately 1 1/2 hours, three days a
week.

Oliver has a set regimen for
Shorter, a member of the All—Big
East first team.

“At the end of last year,
Shorter was 228 pounds, and he
worked hard all throughout the
season. This year, I’d like for him
to be about 240 pounds at the
end of the summer and have
about 16 percent body fat. At the
end of the preseason, he’ll weigh
235 pounds and have 11 to 12
percent body fat. He weighs 229
pounds right now," Oliver said.

Shorter shot a Pitt record -
59 percent from the ﬂoor — last
year. ‘By the middle of the season
he was Pitt’s most dangerous
offensive weapon and was con-
sistently the target of double-

‘teaming, which took its toll on

him. at times. T hat’s why Shorter.

   

feels his training this summer will
be at least as important as last
year’s.

“The team is going to depend
on me even more next year than
this year. Sometimes I know I’ll
be playing 40 minutes."

Even after an all-star first

season, Shortersaid that he still.

has more work to do if he is to
continue his offensive domina-
tion and contribute to the welfare
of the entire squad.

“I want to be able to come
out to about 15 feet and hit the
jump shot so there won’t be
double teams, and I want to work
on my defense, my foot speed.”

Oliver has the same notion.

“What he wanted to work on,
and I think he needs to work on,
is strengthening his legs. If he's
going to play 40 minutes, he’ll
need to.”

A There's no lack of effort on
Shorter’s part, according to O1-
iver. ‘ ’

“He’s a catalyst," Oliver said,
“the catalyst in making every one
of our athletes understand what
it takes in the weight room.” '

“Everything we do in [the

said Ray “Rock” Oliver, the
Pitt strength and conditioning
coach. “My goal is to be the
best in the league. That’s the

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, May 17, 1989

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

The merry month of May
didn’t bring much joy to the Pitt
baseball team. Instead, it brought
a lot of rain and frustration as the
Panthers’ ﬁnal four games were
all canceled due to inclement
weather.

Pitt ended their season with
a disappointing 6-25 record, 0-17
in the Big East. The Panthers
were out—scored 282-115.

Pitt Coach Bobby Lewis
admits the record leaves a lot to
be desired, but he said a lot of
good things came out of the
season.

“Record-wise, the year was
like a disaster,” said Lewis. “But
you have to look at the positive

' Baseball team ﬁnishes

as well as the negative.”

One of the positives Lewis
points out is the individual efforts
of some of the players. TJ. O’leary,
Carl Frcnchik and Matt Bianco
batted over .500.

O’leary, who played in all 31
games, led the Panthers with a
.368 average. He also led the
team in runs scored (17) and hits
(42).

Frenchik batted .359 in his
limited playing action. He played
in 14 of Pitt’s games and had 14
hits. Bianco hit for a .550 average
and added 13 RBIs and 10 runs
scored. Bianco also walked. a
team—lcading 18 times, which
raised his on-base percentage to
.447.

Jon Weaver led the Panthers
with 14 RBIs. Weaver also played

in all 31 games this season. David
Kirilloff cranked out two home
runs, leading Pitt in that depart-
ment.

But, any coach will say the
key to winning baseball games is
pitching, which Pitt didn’t have
much of this year. For the most
part, their pitching staff was young
and inexperienced. Lewis under-
stands it is difficult for pitchers in
their first year.

“It’s a tough way to learn, but
you learn,” said Lewis. “You
would like to make it easy on
them, but you can’t. They were
shoved in there to face some
tough hitters. I think they found
out that you can't be a thrower in
this league, you have to be a
pitcher. You could get away with

Riddick named Sunkist All-American

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

Panther safety Louis Riddick
was selected as a Fiesta Bowl
Samaritan All-American and will
attend the annual Fiesta Bowl
Spring Banquet in May.

Top sportswriters from
around the country chose Rid-
dick, a 6-foot, 3,220—pound jun-
ior, and 15 other athletes from
across the country to receive the
award. The award honors those
athletes that excel in citizenship,
leadership, and sportsmanship as
well as for their efforts on the
field.

Riddick is in good company
with previous Pitt athletes who
have won the award. Tony
Dorsett, Dan Marino, and Bill
Fralic are all former Fiesta Bowl

' Samaritan All-Americans.

 Bei ng selected for this honor
is important because it shows
that football isn’t all that’s valued
when choosing candidates for
prestigious awards. It’s impor-
tant to round your athletic career
with performance in the class-
room and community activities,”
said Riddick. '

Riddick volunteers for vari-
ous community service activities
such as the Veteran’s Administra-

tion Hospital Visitation Program
and the Special Olympics Foot-
ball Clinics that Pitt sponsors.

Riddick is also being recog-
nized for his achievements in the
classroom. He is a nominee for
the 1989 Anson Mount Scholar/
Athlete Award. This award hon-
ors starting student athletes who
carry at least a 3.0 grade point
average.

The Associated Press named
Riddick honorable mention All-
East last season at strong safety.
Riddick, who had 65 tackles, will
play free safety for the Panthers
this season..

THE PITT NEWS

Ladies team places fifth

Kesha Demas qualified for
the NCAA Championship meet,
and two Pitt school records were
broken as the Lady Panthers took
fifth at the Eastern Championship
meet held lastweekend in Fairfax,
Va.

Demas won the 400-meter
event with a time of 53.08 and
qualified for the NCAA Champi-
onship meet to be held in June.

Demas was also the anchor
for Pitt's winning 4x400 relay
team. Clarissa Dudley, Debbie
Banner and Pat Cupid ran the
relay with Demas. Their time of
3:40.42 was good for a new school

at Eastern Championship

record.

Alexis Archer broke her own
school record in the triple jump.
She leaped 12.1 meters, good for
a fifth-place finish at the meet.

Demas, Dudley and Cupid
teamed with Vanessa Jones and
placed I.hird in the 4x100 relay.
They ran the event in :47.25.

Dudley was also impressive
in the heplathalon. She amassed
4,992 points in the event and
placed second.

Debbie Bonner placed sec-
ond in the 100 hurdles running
the distance in :14.42.

Pitt remembers Woodmjf
1936 US. Gold Medalist

When Pitt hosted the 19th
annual John Woodruff Track
Invitational last Saturday the big
question in many peoples mind
was; Who is John Woodruff?

Woodruff was a 800-meter
gold medalist in the 1936 Olym-
pic Games in Berlin. He also set
numerous records "wearing a Pitt
uniform. He won numerous IC/IA
and NCAA titles in the middle
distance track events.

Woodru ff‘s gold medal effort
was somewhat overshadowed by
the performance ofjessie Owens
in the 1936 Olympics. In some
ways Woodruffs victory meant
more than those of Owens.
Woodruff wasn’t expected to win
and he fell behind early in his
race. However, the long strides
by Woodruff carried him to the
finish line first. He was the first
Pitt athelete to win a gold medal
in the Olympics.

Woodruffs victory was also
special because it came at a time
when black atheletes were some-
what new and unaccepted into
sports. The performances of
Woodruff and Owens somehow

 

paved the way for respectability
of black atheletes.

Woodru if was born and
raised in Connellsville, Pa lo-
cated SO miles southeast of Pitts-
burgh. It was there, in that small
coal-mining town that Woodruff
learned of his awesome running
abilities.
