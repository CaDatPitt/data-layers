-Students celebrate for ‘Egypt

Rally to support Egyptian protests turns into celebration after Mubarak steps down

Olivia Garber
Assistant News Editor

When former Egyptian president
Hosni Mubarak stepped down
from power Friday, he also threw

qa wrench in plans for a rally on

campus in support of the Egyptian
protesters. '
The gathering was initially
planned as a showing of support
for the protesters, who pressured
Mubarak to resign after almost
three weeks of demonstrations.
Pitt students decided they would
celebrate with the Egyptian peo-
ple. ’
Sophomore Maryem Mabrouk
was in the middle of a chemistry

..:test when her friend texted her the

news about Mubarak. I
At ﬁrst, she was excited and

happy for Egypt. But as the initial '
waves of joy subsided, she was left *

with a few questions.
“So are weostill going? ;)” she
; posted on the Facebook wall for the
rally. Ryan Branagan, who created
the event titled Kefaya! Rally in
Support of the Egyptian Revolu-
tion, quickly afﬁrmed that the rally
was still going on.
Branagan, a sophomore, said
he was at work when he got a text
about the news.

“I got elated and immediately»

knew I had to switch the event,”
he said.
The rally, which started around

 3 p.m., quickly drew about 30 peo-

ple. Red balloons, Egyptian ﬂags
and a tambourine attracted the
"honks and cheers of drivers and

pedestrians passing through the
intersection of Forbes Avenue and
Bigelow Boulevard.

Mabrouk was one of many cel-s

ebrants holding signs — hers said,

“It is better to die for something”

you love than to live for nothing.”

But while the crowd chanted
“Free at last!” most of its members
were aware that the turmoil that
has been broiling in Egypt for the
past weeks isn’t over.

With Mubarak gone and power
in the hands of Egypt’s military
leaders, analysts are worried that
the current situation could lead to
a political vacuum.

Aljazeera, a satellite news ser-
vice based in Qatar, assembled a
number of opinions from foreign
policy experts and pro—democracy
campaigners in Egypt. They dis-
agreed over where the country
would go in the next few years, and
what would be the immediate steps
after Mubarak’s resignation.

This question, “What’s next for

Egypt?” was on Tolu Banjo’s mind ’

when she found out about the ces-
sion of power on Yahoo! News.
Banjo, ajunior who went with

Mabrouk to the rally, said she isn’t .

sure what exactly will happen

during the seven months before;-«

Egypt’s next election — a topic
of contention for many analysts
‘— but was still conﬁdent about
the role this revolution will play
in other African countries.

Many talk primarily about the
role Egypt plays in the Middle East,
but as Banjo noted, “Egypt is in
Africa.” ,

Banjo, who moved from Africa

to study at Pitt, said she thought i
the protests in Egypt could spur *

similar movements for democracy
in other African countries.
Branagan called this a “ripple

« effect.”

. He cited the recent’ street pro-

tests in Tunisia that ousted the ’
country’s president as the begin-

ning of the pattern.
That inspired Egyptians to take

to the streets to protest their own ’

long-standing government, and
now there’s “a new age for the en-
tire region,” Branagan said.
_“There’s hope for the Middle
East, for democracy,” he said.
Mehvish Ally, ajunior who was

among the ﬁrst at the rally, said she,

thought the Egyptian protesters
now have to make sure that the
military does not become the new
government.

But she thought thetenacity
and determination of the protest-
ers would make; a future police
state unlikely. .

“I have faith that [the protest-
ers] are not going to let that hap-
pen,” she said.‘ , ‘

Both she and Mabrouk drew

comparisons from the current.

Egyptian revolution to the one

 _. that happened in the United States‘

more than two centuries ago.

Mabrouk said Pitt’ students
should be aware of the events in
Egypt because, in terms of national
impact, it’s on the same level as the
American Revolution.

Ally agreed.

“It’s the same exact battle, just
in the Sahara,” she said. I

Men’s Basketball
Pitt 57, Villanova 54

With or without Ashton Gibbs, the

No. 4 Pitt men’s basketball team

keeps winning. V ‘
VillanovaplayerIsaiahArmwood’s

intentional technical foul with 16:22 -

remaining kicked off a 19-4 Pittrun,
and the Panthers ended the Wildcats’
46-game win streak at the Pavilion
with a 57-54 win Saturday night.
Pitt (23—2, 11-1 Big East) strug-
gled offensively in the ﬁrst half, but
Armwood’s foul seemed to give the
Panthers the jumpstart they needed.
Armwood hit Nasir Robinson in the

face as Armwood attempted to pull ’

teammate Mouphtaou Yarou away
from a tangle of players. After re-
viewing the incident on the court-
side monitor, referees awarded Pitt

two shots plus possession, and Vil- . ‘

lanova’s ﬁve—point lead, soon turned
into a deﬁcit.

Pitt opened up an 11—point'lead
 ﬁve minutes remaining, yet the
No. 10 Wildcats (19—6, 7-5 Big East)
mounted a late surge that brought
them within three points. But Domi-
nic Cheek’s desperate attempt in the
game’s ﬁnal possession clanked off
the rim, and Maalik Wayns’ 3-pointer
was a fraction of a second too late.

Philadelphia native Brad Wa-
namaker had 21 points in Gibbs’ ab-
sence, even though the Panthers did
not shoot the ball well for much of the

. game. Pitt didn’t make a 3-pointer ‘

until Travon ‘Woodall hit one with
13:35 to go. .
“I thought we played well. W
didn’t shoot it well,” Pitt head coach
Jamie Dixon saidinapost—game press
conference. 5

The Panthers ﬁnished 1-for-10
ﬁ'om 3-point range.

“We had good looks,” Dixon said.
“We’ll come out and make [threes]
next game.” i

Robinson, also from the Philadel-

phia area, ﬁnished with 15 points. '_ 1

Pitt’s offense missed Gibbs for

the second straight game, but Vil- .
’ lanova also played shorthanded. Se-

nior guard Corey Stokes missed the
game because of turf toe. With Stokes
and Gibbs sitting on their respective
benches, the teams combined for one

3-pointer in the ﬁrst half.
Women’s basketball
Pitt 70, South Florida 66

In a back-and—forth game that includ-
ed 12 lead changes, the Pitt women’s
basketball team prevailed over th
South Florida Bulls. '

But it had to call on some familiar
faces to gain inspiration ﬁrst.

At halftime of the Panthers’ (12-
12, 4-7 Big East) 70-66 win over the
Bulls at the Petersen Events Center
on Saturday, the players recognized
20 basketball alumni from the team’s
past, includingjennifer Bruce Scott,
Kim Tirik and Sally Sheerer. It was
the team’s third win‘ in four games
and pulled Pitt’s record up to .500
on the season.

“Having our alumni here talking
about their stories from when they
used to be here and knowing that’s
going to be us puts it into perspec-
tive that it’s almost over,” senior
forward Chelsea Cole said in a post-
game press conference. “We know
we’ve got to ride it until the wheels
.fall 0 .” A '

But formuch of the game, it didn’t

seem like Pitt was going to gain its

fourth Big East win.

South Florida (10-15, 1-10 Big‘

East) was in front for much of the
game and led by as many as 11 points
early in the second half.

The Bulls’ rebjoundiiigdominance
allowed them to take the early lead.
South Florida was led by 6-foot-4
freshman center Akila McDonald,

- who gave Pitt problems all afternoon

and recorded 15 points and ._seven
rebounds.  l S '

. South Florida as ‘a team totaled
17 offensive rebounds and 15 second-
chance points. , ' V V .

“Itwas absolutely frustrating giv-

A ing up so many offensive rebounds,”

Pitt head coach ‘Agnus Berenato said

fused to let their team lose. ’

Letter from the editor

Dear Readers:
Apparently students don’t just like talking about sex — they like having it, too.

Last year the Yale Daily News e—mailed a poll to its readers. Its goal was to ﬁnd out
as much as it could about readers’ sex lives to gather data for its annual “Sex at Yale”
edition. The paper succeeded.

Yale’s results proved that more than 60 percent of its students polled have had sex
while in college, and the average senior has made out with eight people in college.

Surprised? Neither were we. But we were surprised by the coverage that followed in
The New York Times. In an article published last year, the Times explored reasons why
“hookup culture” was so prevalent on college campuses. At UNC Chapel Hill, the Times
reported, the lack of relationships is caused by a 60540 female—to—male ratio. Guys had
so many options that they generally didn’t feel a need to settle down with just one girl. ,
Pitt has a similar ratio, but that can’t always be the cause of the cultural change.

So, what is it about college these days that makes students stray from relationships
and to a ﬂoormate’s bed? I’m not sure we have the answer for you. What I do know is that
when ﬁnding models for this photo shoot and explaining the concept of the Sex Edition,
no one I asked even blinked an eye. Wrap myself up in caution tape? Wear handcuffs and
pretend to makeout? Sure, why not?

Our generation isn’t desensitized to sex. Instead, we embrace it. The content of this
issue reﬂects the open—mindedness of Pitt students, whether the issue is about sexless
relationships or transgender lifestyles. Although the photos correspond with the articles,
the goal was to create art thattstands alone and reﬂects both the “light” and “dark”
aspects of sex, such as marriage versus cheating. I hope you like it.

Enjoy our third annual Sex Edition, and happy Valentine’s Day. ’
Sincerely,

Becky Reiser

There’s sex, and there’sSafer sex

Sexual activity poses health risks, but taking certain precautions canmake the activity saferfor all participants”. 7

Gwenn Barney
Senior Staﬂ’ Writer

Pitt’s Student Health Service prefers to use
the term “safer sex” when discussing inter-
course because any type of sexual activity
comes with some level of risk, whether it’s
pregnancy or sexually transmitted infec-
tions.

“Students should know that abstinence
from all sexual activity is the only way to
completely prevent unintended pregnancy
and STIs. But if you choose to be sexually
active, you should protect yourself with
contraceptives and condoms,” Pitt’s Stu-
dent Health Service said in an e-mail state-
ment.

_ Alan Jones, a counselor with the Pitts-

" burgh AIDS, Task Force, agreed that above

all else, condoms are the key to being safe in
the sack. Not only does the use of a condom
lower the risk of unwanted pregnancy, but it
also reduces the risk of contracting STIs -
such as HIV, chlamydia and syphilis.Jones
said that when it comes to using rubbers,
practice makes perfect. ‘

“Guys need to get’ comfortable using
condoms,” he said. “Don’t wait until the
moment of sex to use a condom forthe
ﬁrst time.”

Jones also said there are different types
and sizes of condoms, so guys should ﬁnd
the one that works best for them. He ad-
vises investment in a latex—free brand for
those who suffer from latex allergies. The

‘ same applies tofemale condoms.

But if unprotected sex happens, both
partners involved should get tested for STIs
as soon as possible. Even though there is a
25-60 day window before the virus shows
up on test results, experts across the health
community recommend that unprotected
sex partners get testedlimmediately so they
know if they are unknowingly carrying vi-
ruses from previous sexual encounters.

Jones warns against making assump-
tions about a love interest’s sexual history
and whether or not he or she might be an
STI carrier.

“You’ve already put them up on a pedes-
tal,”Jones explains. “They look clean. They
look nice; They’re not going to be positive
[for STIs] in our minds. But remember, the
nicest girl or guy can be positive.”

If a person is sexually active, it’s not
a bad idea to get regularly screened for
STIs. It’s also good to remember that when
it comes to preventing the transmission
of STIs, practicing abstinence is always
another viable option.

Of course, sex is never safe without con-
sent or when violence is involved.

“It’s very hard to navigate that ﬁne line
between being social and putting yourself.
in a bad situation in college,” said Laura
Summers, an education and training spe-

cialist for Pittsburgh Action Against Rape,
a nonproﬁt that works to increase sexual
assault awareness.

Summers believes the most important
part of preventing sexual assault while in a
relationship is communication. If a woman

says “no” to sex in a relationship and her,

partner feels differently, Summers recom-
mends the two sit down and talk out the
situation. But even if people don’t appreci-
ate their partners’ reasoning for refraining

/

from sex, they should still respect it.

“A lot of times wehearfrom guys, “No,
she really didn’t mean it,”’ Summers said.
“Only yes means yes.”

Mary Ruiz, Pitt’s coordinator of Sexual
Assault Services, agrees with Summers. She
said that for the most part, sexual assaults
can be prevented.

‘ To be safe, Ruiz recommended sexual
decisions. never be made under the inﬂu-
ence of alcohol. She believes that instanc-

 

  

es of sexualassault can also be avoided

‘ if women communicate how far theyfare

willing to go sexually.

“If a guyasks a— girl to come up to his
room to listen to music and there’s the po;,,
tential that he could want to have sex, but
the girl knows she doesn’t want to have
sex, she should tell him, ‘Yes, I’ll come up
to your room, but I’m not having sex with
you,”’ Ruiz said. I

R011 to the right. Who is that?

The regrettable and unwelcome realizations
that often come the morning afterunprotected sex
canbeoverwhelmingfor some students. Whether
a crimewas committed, inhibitions were lowered,
therewaspoorplanning oraregularbirth control
metl1odfailed,ﬁguringoutwhat needstobe done
can be confusing and frightening.

But that does not always have to be the case.
Katie Clark, health center manager at Plarmed
Parenthood ofwestem Pennsylvania, said there
are many resources available to help bothwomen
and men help alter unprotected sex. .

AsenioratPitt, who wished to remain anony-
mous because he fearedbeing stigmatized, talked

about the fears felt after having unprotected sex ’

during a threesome.

“One ofthe girls insisted on going downstairs
to get a condom,” he said “The other girl didn’t
and jumped right on me.”

-“I was deﬁnitely worried in the mornin ” he
said. “I asked her if shewas on birth control, and
she said she was.” ‘ ' t

A common concern for both sexes is un-

I wanted pregnancy. Pitt health-care providers

said emergency contraception is a safe and effec-
tive way to prevent pregnancy after unprotected
intercourse. — ,

Emergency contraception is notan abortion
pill —-— instead, it is made from one of the hor-
mones commonly found in birth control pills,
progestin. The hormone keeps awoman’s ovaries
from releasingeggs. Ifthere is no eggtojoinwith
sperm, then pregnancy can not occur.

Dr.ElizabethWettick, medicaldirectorofPitt  

Student Health Service, said there are currently
fourFDA—approved products available for emer-
gency contraception. '

“Three ofthese products areapprovedforpre-

make an adequate substitution for emergency
contraception. '

Unless they are under direct supervision of a
physician, Clark suggested that students purchase
a pill designated for emergency contraception,
rather than take multiple doses of their regular
birth control.

“We generally don’t recommend
do that,” Clark said. '

Inaddition to pregnancy, many students also
worry about becoming infected with a sexually
transmitted infection.‘ Clark noted that running
to a clinic to be tested the morning after unpro-
tected sex might not reveal S’I'Is because some
take longer to show up on a test.

The anonymous student said he was lucky

tpatients

and had scheduled a doctor’s appoinunent for a I
. few weeks after the unprotected-sex. He said his

test came back clean.

Clark said the two most common S'1‘Is are
gonorrhea and chlamydia.

The Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion reported in 2008 that there are between
1,000 to 3,000 chlamydia cases per 100,000
people aged 15 to 24 in Allegheny County. There
are morethan600 gonorrhea cases per100,000
people for the same age group in Allegheny
County. I '

“Ifthere is any concern the sexual partnerhad
an S'I‘I, then it would be a good idea to make an
appointment for S11 testingj’, Wettick said.

Clark said suggested students gettested about
two weeks after unprotected sex, unless they
experience symptoms sooner. '

Gonorrhea can_take between two and seven
days to show on a test, whereas chlamydia takes
one to two weeks. I

Accordingto plannedparenthood.org, three
out of fourwomen and halfof all men with chla-
mydia have no symptoms, and four out of five
women and one out of 10 men with gonorrhea
have no symptoms.

For men fearing a swab test, which would
collect samples by swabbing inside the penis,

Few people like to talk about sexual assault. But
that doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen.

Sexual assault is deﬁned as non—consensual
sexthat does not involve force. Rape is also non-
consensual and is forced.

Pitt police records show that between 2007
and 2009, there was one rape on campus. In
2009, the cityfs annual crime report showedthat
there were 116 rapes inthe city, and eightinOak—
land. Southwestem Pennsylvania had the lowest
rates of forced rape in the state.

But many go unreported.

Katie Clark, healthoenter managerat Planned
Parenthood ofWestem Pennsylvania, and Mary
Ruiz, coordinatorof sexual assault services at Pitt,
offered suggestions for responding to a sexual
assault.

Both stressed that victims should get to a
medicalfacilityas soonas possible, ideallywithin
72 hours. Ruiz said women should go to Magee—
Womens Hospital and men should go to UPMC
Presbyterian;

Do not shower, Ruiz said. This will preserve
any evidence ofthe assault. -

 

At the hospital, a rape exam willbe adminis-

tered. “The rape exam doesn’t prove necessarily
thatarapeoccurred, but itwould indicatewhether
or not therewas apresence of semento indicate
that sexual activity took place,” Ruiz said.

‘Ifa victim resisted, vaginal ripping or tear-
ing might be present — all of which would be
documented.

In the event of a sexual assault, the hospital
contacts the police and a rape victim advocate
from Pittsburgh Action Against Rape, a non-
proﬁt organization that helps vict1'ms of sexual
assault. — .

Ifa victim ﬁles a police report, the exam ——
which costs about $800 — is covered by the
state;

‘”Thatdoesn’t meanyou havetopress charges,”
Ruiz said. “just tell the police what happen .”

Student Health does not collect any physical
evidence of sexual assault; a Victim must go to
the hospital for a rape exam. Student Health is a
resource for medical treatment and can test for
STIs and pregnancy. A gynecological exam can
be conducted at hospitals to document internal
trauma. '

How to attract your dreamdate on the web

Despite years of hard—hitting research by

it’s a dreamboy/dreamgirl you’re after, you
should consider visiting the same Internet

you can announce to the denizens of this

nonetheless still reasonable number, like
6—foot—4? That’s a lottaller than 5-foot—1,
and as long as you don’t provide any photos
of yourself standing next to anyone bigger,

no one.will be the wise"r.‘In the unlikely

event that your date discovers this ruse,
it’ll be too late — he or she will be too
smitten by your winning personality to
call you on it.

You’ll want to showcase that personality
in the next section. This “about me” ﬁeld is
an opportunity to ﬂash your writing skills
while demonstrating how awesome you
are. But how to start? Here’s a good sample
beginning — feel free to borrow it:

“Hi there! I’m a very cool young guy/girl

with a lot of interests as well as a nice heart,

and a good personality.”

See what we did there? Right away the
reader knows that you’ve got many inter-
ests, a nice heart and a good personality.
No way will he or she stop reading now, so
let’s keep this winning streak alive:

“One .of my favorite things to do is to go
out on the town. and paint it red. Another
favorite thing is staying in and curling up
with a book, a cup of tea or a movie.”

Whoa! Now that the reader knows you’re

’ an expert at both going out and staying in,
he or she is probably eager to put a ring on

it.‘ The fact that you’re an inveterate reader,
a tea drinker and a fan of the cinema is just
icing on cake. Let’s continue developing
our masterpiece:

' “Unlike a lot of girls/guys, I am for real

, and in the market for something serious-.
V However, I would not mind if it just hap-

pens because I can go with the ﬂow. You
never know whenthere will be a spark.
When it’s right, it’s right. True love is. out
there and it’s worth waiting for. No scrubs
or players, please.”

You’re already far ahead of the game, so

Is  okay to combine work and play?

Ojfice relationships happen all the time, and The Pitt News is no exception: The story of two colleagues and classmates who became more than that.

Becky Reiser
Managing Editor

 

Iwasn’t supposed to write this column.

Iwasn’tsupposedto admitto beinginvolvedin
a workplace relationship, and I especially wasn’t
expected to tell you that 1 dated my boss. But I
did ‘

The workplace relationship is the elephant in
the oﬂice. It is large and takes up an entire desk,
classroom or checkout line. It passes notes and
e-mails instaff meetings and shares glances with

you over computerscreens. Itis whispered about
over lunchbreaks and stared at duringworkpar-
ties.

Chances are that most of you know what I’rn
talking about. Accordingto a2oo9 survey by ca-
reerbuilder.corn, 40 percent of surveyed workers
admitted to dating a co —worker.

Of those, 42 percent admitted to dating their

. boss. And itwasn’t just girls enamoredbypowerlirl
' superiors — more than one—third of respondents

weremen. ,.
_ Have you seen alot of doors closed and shades
drawn lately? Apparentlywe are no longerliv/ing

in a “Mad Men”-esque society, where office as-
sistants sleptwiththeirbosses and new, younger
secretaries were introduced periodicallytoboost
morale. '

Instead, at work we are ﬁnding our dates —
and sometimes, our lifetime partners. The same
survey found that three in 10 people who dated a
co—worker ended up marrying that person.

In college and soon after, you will spend the
majority ofyour time atwork. (Ifyou’re fortunate
enoughtohave ajob,tl1atis.) Therewon’tbe class-
es to distractyou orbasement parties to plan. You
will dress to impress with other college graduates

atyour internship, er_1try—level position or stintin
graduate teaching. Just like ir1 high school when
your signiﬁcant others were decided by classes or
‘extracurriculars, yourworkwillbecome asocial
outlet. This holds true especially if you are in a
new city — or say, Pittsburgh — without any of
your former classmates.

I didn’t date anyone to get ahead. Luckily for
me, the promotions I received at work were de-
cided before I started seeing my boss, or were
awardedby someone else altogether. My relation-
ship wasn’t in any way inﬂuential. I don’t believe
this is always the case, but relationships stemming
from the workplace should never have motives
other than the proverbial butterflies.

There are plenty of places online to ﬁnd advice
about such situations. Some sources sayjustto for-
get romance at work altogether, whereas others
offer discreetness asyourbiggestweapon. There
are some places ofbusiness which even have their
own rules about dating a co—worker. The ones
that allow it often encourage both members of
the relationship to sign an agreement saying that
theyare involved inaconsensual relationship —
perhaps for no other reasonthantopreventﬁiurre

If none of this scares you and you’ve thought
indepth aboutwhatwould happen ifyou and your

— sweetheartweretobreakupbutstillbeforcedto

play nice at the office, then byall means, go ahead
and planarendezvous.‘ -

Imust admit, Ididn’tthinkverylongaboutthe
above recommendations. Looking back, I wish I
had. I’m still in said relationship and happy to
report that things are progressing swimmingly.
But no one ever told me aboutthe gossip, the looks
or the jealousy that arises ﬁom dating someone
you work with. They also never told me how hard
itwould be to keep it asecret— somethinglwas
able to manage for only a couple of months. I
deﬁnitely was a victim of the stink eye, ‘juno”—
style, more than once.

Arumor startedatmyofﬁce. Apparentlyalot
of people believed the rumors because I started
getting weird looks and texts alluding to some-
thing —— something that I didn’t do. How do you
handle that? I couldn’t exactly confront the gos-
sip unless I admitted to the relationship, which I
wasn’t ready to do yet. I didn’t want anyone else
ﬁghting my battles for me, so I couldn’t ask my
boss to address it. s ,

In a “normal” relationship, I guess you can
discuss these things as they come up. If you get
jealous about the treatment of another person,
you talk it out. In the olﬁce, you are mandatorily
quiet and professional. There is no room for pet-
tiness behind closed doors, because it just isn’t
conducive to a working relationship.

, My ﬁiends constantly asked me whyI didn’t
get sick of the personlwas seeing. After all, I saw
himpretty much every day. ' V

Honestly‘?v'_I‘hat was the easiest part. Afte
worklwas abletobe myselfwith someoneléared

’ about. I didn’t have to ‘hide my feelings or text

instead of having an actual conversation. It was
liberatingto leave the oﬂice and not have to think
so hard about what I said or howl acted. After
all, everythingwas easier— both at work and at
home — afterl had ditched the elephant. ﬂ .

Some students say that Pitt is gay-friendly. Oth-
ers say it still needs work. But though there’s
disagreement over the degree of tolerance, all
agree that education is the key to a more ac-
cepting campus.

That education can’t come soon enough for .

some. A
Jamie Klousnitzer said she can recall a few
instances in which gay people on campus expe-
rienced degrees of harassment. A
“I’ve heard of people having ‘faggot’ shouted
at them, mostly from drunk guys, or someone
saying ‘Look, acouple of gay guys!’Again, mainly
from drunk guys,” the Pitt junior said.
Sophomore Sam Rynearson feels comfort-
able walking hand inhand withhisboyfriend on
campus, but would not feel comfortable kissing
in public.
“Gay PDAis sornethingthatl don’tthinkthose
on campus can handle,” Rynearson said.

of offensive language used on campus. _
But representatives for the lesbian-gay-
transgendered—queer-and~allied community

Senior and RainbowAlliance member Timo-
thy Craft said that Pitt’s maincampus feels much
more gay—frien"dly than some other campuses.
He said the Rainbow Alliance here in Oakland is
strong, with more active members and scheduled
events than other places he’s been.

Craft said the term “gay-friendly” refers to a
campus “havingalevel of tolerance, accommoda-
tion and awillingness to learn and change.”

Representatives for Pitt administrators and
for Rainbow Alliance outlined what they do to try
to make the campus LGBTQA~friendly.

Although Pitt administrators don’t believe
that the complete prevention of discrimination

Atthe forefront of student—driven education,
Pitt has The Rainbow Alliance.

The Rainbow Alliance is a student organiza-
tion aimed at providing for the concerns of tlie
LGBTQA community. , ‘

In an effortto maintainfwhat it views as a
supportive atmosphere, Pitt’s RainbowAlliance
looks forward to increasing its a_vailable resources
on campus, said Alliance publicity chair Drew
Marquis. _ .

“We would really love.to._.have a bigger and
nicer resource center with ajtrained staff and

Marquis explained that education and knowl-

_edge remain a large goal of the RainbowAlliance,
which hopes that with more awareness on cam-
pus, Pittwill continue to improve its gay—friendly
atmosphere.

about the stereotypes that exist surrounding

Whether they’re using Marvin Gaye, scented
candles or oysters, college kids are always
looking for an easy way to set the mood with
their “special” ﬁiends. Many ﬁnd that watch-

‘ifig the right movie can be the perfect way to
set things off.

A good hook-up ﬁlm doesn’t have to be one
laden with sexual activity — in fact, many of
the “success” stories I’ve heard have resulted
from less obvious titles. For example, a tactic
endorsed by many is to pick a movie so boring
that, to a potential mate, the idea of hooking
up becomes more palatable.

“Iremember watching ‘No Country for
Old Men’ with a girl and she got so bored I
didn’t even have to ask,” freshman Nishant

_§1ingh said.
'_ The key to this approach is subtlety. Bring-
ing someone to your room to watch the four
hour extended edition of “Lord of the Rings”
would make your ulterior motives transpar-

ent, whereas a more conventional movie like. .

“Avatar” doesn’t aimounce any hidden agenda
—— and is just as boring.

Director Wes Anderson, with his slow-
paced and quirky ﬁlms, is the perfect middle
ground. “The Life Aquatic,” for example, has
a two -hour runtime ﬁill of still shots, dialogue

and sarcastic humor, all of which are guar-
anteed to strategically bore your would-be
mate. .

But subtlety isn’t everyone’s strongsuit.
Some ﬁnd the added tension from a sexually
explicit ﬁlm perfect for their motives. Movies
like “American Pie” or “Zach and Miri Make
a Porno” are good choices if you’d rather not

L take the plunge directly into pornography.

But if it isn’t a ﬁrst-time deal, actual porn is
the choice for some. ’ — l

“I like to watch porn if I already know the
girl,” freshman Brandon Yaple said.

Films with passionate love scenes could be
just right for setting the mood. For example,
Leonardo DiCaprio and Vera Farrniga have a
passionate scene in “The Departed” that is
guaranteed to get things started. And if you
fall into a more aggressive sexual niche, one
student recommended the two-prostitute
sex scene in “American Psycho” to get the

passions rising.

Action movies offer more of a double-
edged sword. Although not everyone would
be interested in sitting through “The Trans-
porter,” the risk is having someone become
too engaged to carry anything out.

“I can’t watch a movie like ‘The Expend-
ables’ with a girl or I’ll_get too into it and
forget she’s there,” a sophomore studying in
the Cathedral said.

The best way to avoid this is to pick a

movie you’ve already seen. The action-packed
scenes in “Crank” lose most of their punch
the second time around. _

Romantic comedies are often the movie

of choice for hook-ups. Every Valentine’s Day, _

the market is ﬂooded with cheesy ﬁlms that
have self— explanatory titles like “Just Go With
It” or “How Do You Know?” that people take
their dates to see in the hopes that they will
get lucky afterwards. But this doesn’t come
without its drawbacks: These movies often
cast heartthrob actors and actresses sure
to outshine you in the looks department.

Among those that I’ve talked to, watching a’

movie that has an excessively attractive cast
doesn’t help.

“I watched ‘50o Days of Summer’ with a
girl and she couldn’t stop talking about how
hotjoseph Gordon-Levitt was — bad idea,”
freshman Alex Hart said.

This problem exists on both ends of the
spectrum. Guys watching movies like “The

Love Guru” often get sidetracked with the

beautiful female leads. I
“Dude, if there is a really hot girl in the
movie, I can easily lose focus on my gir ,” a

- sophomore at Market Central said.

If you’ve got to watch aromantic comedy,
choose one with a less conﬁdence-threat-
ening cast. For example, a movie starring
Michael Cera or Ellen Page most likely won’t
leave your partner weak in the knees with

Certain. movies can lead to intimate moments

. misdirected lust.
Girls aren’t in the dark about these tactics.
For them, when a guy asks to watch a movie,
they generally know what the situation is.
“If I actually like the guy, then the movie

doesn’t really matter. I can usually tell if he’s ”

being a creep and trying to trick me into
something,” freshman Liza Boulet said.

When in a relationship, many girls say the
movie choice is up to them. ‘In this case, the
girl dictates where the night is headed.

“If you really want to hook up,’ you have to
pick a movie you won’t get interested [in] —
girls are easily distracted, so we can’t watch

a movie that we like,” a group of girls eating;

at Market Central said. V

Guys shouldn’t assume that picking any
movie will particularly help their chances of
getting lucky. From the moment the idea of
watching a movie is presented, girls usually
know what’s going on. What matters is how
well- the guy has been doing in every other
department.

“I can usually tell when someone is trying
to hook up,'ifhe’s a good guy I’ll let him think

. that he was being really clever,” sophomore
Argie Zoubroulis said. ‘

In the end, there is no real magic formula.
The key is actually gaining the affection of

There’s more to sex and relationships

Put a ring on it?

Marriage is in the not—so-distant future for collegegraduates

- ‘A , V Shae’ Felicien
Sta_[fWriter

When it comes to dating and marriage, colleges
students as a group are a bit of an anomaly —
they like it but they don’t want to put a ring
on it. For the moment, most are enjoying the
hookup phase. . V

When they do tie that proverbial knot, likely
several years afterthey leave school, college
graduates’ marriages will have statistically
higher success rates.

The 2010 reportfrom the U.S. Census Bureau
indicates that the median age for ﬁrst marriage
has increased, with men getting married around
28 and women around 26. _ A ‘ _

“The more education you have, the more
likely ‘you are to get married, and college—ed_-
ucated men and women are more likely to get
married, less likely to get divorced, more likely
to have stable marriages, and less likely to have
children outside of marriage,” said Christine
Whelan, a sociology professor and the author
of two books on marriage.

Whelan said statistics in the past have shown
that 90 percent of Americans do marry at some

point in their lives.

“Whether or not that is going to be true for
your generation is a different question, but while
fewer Americans are choosing to get married,
there is one group of Americans that is pretty
gung-ho about marriage — and that’s college-
educated Americans,” Whelan said, addingthat
people with higher levels of education have
higher chances of getting married ‘

The Pew Research Center’s nationwide sur-
vey associated with Time Magazine found that
in20o8, therewas a 16 percent gap in marriage
rates between college graduates —— 64 percent
— and those with a high school diploma or
less —— 48 percent. ‘ L

Whelan said the common statistic that 50
percent of marriages end in divorce doesn’t
necessarilyapply to everyone. V g

A study called “Women’s Education and
Family Behavior: Trends in-Marriage, Divorce
and Fertility,” published last year bythe National

‘Bureau of Economic Research-, suggestedthat

marriages between college-educated spouses
were the least likely to end in a split. After 10
years, only about 16 percent of college-graduate
couples who married in the199os' had split,

Not seeing your signiﬁcant other for
months at a time can build up a lot of ex-
pectation. ,

“The week before you see each other
you’re the horniest,” sophomore Gina Clapp
said. “_You’re counting the days — you know
it’s coming, and you just get excited.”

. High expectations” don’t always translate
into long-term stability though. This past
year, Clapp’s one—and-a-half—year relation-
ship with her high school boyfriend ended.
She said their relationship crumbled because
he joined a frat and was contributing less
time to communication, the cornerstone of
long—distance relationships. Her ex declined
to comment.

Long-distance relationships, in which
both partners live far enough away that they
can’t see each other regularly, have become a
different beast altogether in the digital age,
with tools like instant messaging and Skype
video chatting. Experts say that long-distance

U,NlVERSlTY Absence hurts the heart

Distance can strain some relationships at college

relationships can be made easier with new
technology, but ultimately still depend on
communication, time and effort.

Many students at Pitt reported having
experience with this type of relationship.

Joel Chan, a graduate student in the cogni-
tive psychology department at Pitt, evaluated
his own relationship from the angle of a pro-
fessional academic. He and his ﬁancé often
use Skype and instant messaging to keep in
touch. She is ﬁnishing her senior year as an
undergraduate in Arkansas.

“I think technological advancements like
Skype and IM make LDRs easier in that they
allow for faster communication between the
two partners. Particularly, Skype also enables
facial vision and thus makes it easier for long-
distance partners to express themselves,”
Chan said. V

Chan also pointed out certain disadvan-
tages of his long—distance relationship: “Our
emotional affection for each other did dimin-
ish somehow,” he said.

“After we got back together, it took us
time to adjust and synchronize our sched-

Hook— up culture predominant on campus

Marriage < 15

according to the study. .

More than 20 percent of couples with less
than college education had split, according to
the study. «- c

For now, a hookgup culture

In general, however; college students typi-
cally don’t seem to _be thinking about marriage
— at least not now.

“I feel that the atmosphere of college is very
selficentered — not necessarily negatively, but

they are looking out for their ﬁxture career~‘

wise,” said sophomore Christiana Son. “College
students use this time to ﬁnd themselves and

what they personally want, whereas marriage _

is apartnership.” .

For many, college life seems more centered
on‘ hook-ups than on committed relation-
ships.. v a _-

“Dating patterns here are a bit sporadic.
There are some long~term couples, but there
are others — many in fact —— just looking to
hook up,” Son said.

Whelan described the college environment
as one of casual intimacy. People tend to play

the ﬁeld and focus on dating rather than court-

ship. .

_fy“Courtship is dating with a View toward
marriage, ‘and I don’t think college students
today are engaging in courtship. Dating is the
much more casual sort of thing where you sort
of do it for fun, for social stuff, for popularity
con1petitjons,” Whelan said. ’

’Butthishook-up_culture doesn’tlastforever. _;
Whelan estimated that most members of Pitt’s

graduating class would start  about
courtship in their rnid—twenties. ’ A
“That’s when you go out on acouple. dates
with someone. You don’t go out on more than
a couple dates with them if you don’t see the
relationship going anywhere:: and by go;
ing anywhere, you mean heading potentially
toward a serious relationship and marriage,”
Whelan said. '
When things get serious

Even though some students are content to

date rather than court, others are only steps b

away from marriage. ,

who chose to focus on courtship rather than
dating. She attributed her attitude to the way
she was raised. 

“You’re dating for the purpose of ﬁnding
someone that you could see yourselfspending
the rest of your life with, not just to see how
many people you can spend the rest of your

‘ lifewi ,”.she said.-

The Pitt junior has dated her ﬁancéjeremy
Nelson, who is also a junior,;for'the past seven
and a half years. The couple plans to marry
this August, which will mark their eight-year
anniversary.

“We’ve known for a long time  that we’re

meant for each other, and we are going to stay
together. It just ‘seemed silly to wait if we knew

-that we’ would spend the rest of our lives to-

gether,” Repko said. .
The couple has already taken marriage prep-
aration steps by attending North Way Christian
Community’s newlywed and engaged group,
which is designed to guide couples through

issues they might face in the ﬁiture and to help ’

them connect with one another.

Though VVl1elan acknowledges the potential
success for long-time couples keen on getting
married, she’s still hesitant to recommend mar-
riage to college students.

“A lot can change in those couple of years
out of college, and you want to make sure
you’re choosingapartner thatwill change with
you,” Whelan said.

She said the median age for marriage ranges
between the late 20s and 30s, though she ad-
vises couples not to rush into marriage simply
because the timing seems right

“That’s often the biggest danger. Often 
we have this idea of ‘I should be married by 25’
so we push this relationship which perhaps
wouldn’t necessarily go inthat direction toward
marriage because you’re afraid of the future if
you don’t accomplish this goal,” Whelan said.I

Cheating culture at Pitt

Relationships in college can be complicated by inﬁdelity

ofa rundown Oakland apartment, directly across

' from Sean DiGiulio, who lounged on the bed. In

between them, a student who asked to remain
anonymous tackled afootballplayerin“Madden.”
The student, who will be referred to as “J ohn Stu-
dent,”wantedtoavoidthe socialstigmaassociated
with cheating. ‘

The three talked about cheating and being
cheated on in their relationships. Each had been
inone orthe other position. The issue seems tobe
common in heterosexual college relationships at
Pitt. Hausman said he had been cheated on twice,
but had yet to cheat on a girlfriend. ’

He said he thinks people cheat for three rea— V

sons: alcohol consumption, boredom with their
current relationship and because they want to
once again ﬁnd the “butterﬂies.in the stomach”
feeling. Eiqaerts seem to agree.

‘As relationships start to fade, the sex is less
exciting,” Hausman explained. Thatmight encour-
age someone to look elsewhere, he said.

DiGiulio, who admitted to cheating on a past

girlfriend once, said it might also be a reaction to
growing levels of commitment. R

“Itwas away offeelingfreerthanlwas in my
relationship,” DiGiulio said.

Irene Frieze, a Pitt psychology professor, said
that although there mightbe manyreasons people
cheat in college, the main trigger is unhappiness
withacurrent relationship. g

‘As ageneral rule, itispeoplewho aredissatis-
ﬁed with their current relationship who are most
likely to cheat,” Frieze said in an_e—mail. She also
added, ‘There. are some people. who genuinely

‘ believe that itis OKto have multiple relationships,

so this would be another factor-.’;’

‘flane Doe,” a Pitt freshman who asked for
anonymity, also to avoid the social repercussions
involved with cheating, said that one of her male
friends had been cheated on recently. His girlfriend
was “blatantly dating another kid,” she said.

Evenas cheatingcan ruin arelationship, it can
ruin acheater’s friendships as well. One of Doe’s
former friends cheated on almost every girlfriend
he had. His behavior had ruined their friendship,
she said. '

of Winchester in England, thinks that much of

issues for mostofhis academiccareerand recently '

published a study called “At least with cheating
there is an attempt at monogamy” that analyzed
cheating behavior in college-aged men.

Anderson said via Skype that he got his idea

/‘to study cheating when he approached a fresh-

"inan sociologr class on the ﬁrst day ofthe term
and asked how many had cheated since arriving
at college. Three male students out of 45 raised
their hands. '

The professor wanted to explore why after
only three days on campus, so many men were
apparently cheating on their girlfriends. For the
study, Anderson deﬁned cheating as “any sexual
activitythatwouldupsettheirgirlﬁien .”Inthe
study, hefoundthatmanypeople getinto monoga-
mous relationshipsbecausesocietyexpectsthem

to —- but their biology screams for something ’

9 different.

7 Mostofthe men cheatedwhile inebriated, and
almost immediately regretted it and apologzed.
Most of the cheatingthatAnderson documented
appeared to be without emotional atiachrnent.
After cheating, he said that the boyfriends still
maintained that they loved their girlfriends.

“They love their partners, but want sex with

someone else,” he said. 4

she got a phone call from him.

“He said he was wasted, the worst he’s ever
been,” she said. He told herthathehad met a girl
at a party the previous night and made out with
her. She ended the relationship, but he didn’t stop
there.

“He kepttryingto make itwork,” she said. He
called herseveraltimes and sentﬂowers once. He
saidhestillcaredaboutherandwantedtogetthe

rela_tionshipbacktogether.'I‘hecheatinghad—-at .

Ieastforawhile-—dest:royed hertrustinhim, and
in his gender as a whole.

“One second doing something bad can de-
stroy everything you’ve put into a relationship,”
she said. 1

“Animal instincts” came into the discussion

when DiGiulio said, “It’s natural instinct to want g

to f"‘cl< something.”

Althoughthatmigl1tbet1'ue,Hausman insisted
the decision to act on that desire is oﬁen 
inﬂuenced by alcohol. .

Anderson differentiated cheatingfromhaving
anatfair, inwhichone pannerinacouple becomes
emotionally atiachedtoathirdpatty. He saidthat
aﬂhirs were less common among young people
than instances of cheating. Infollow-up research
with one ofhis graduate students, Anderson has
found that the reasons women cheat are simi-
lar. Although the researchers did ﬁnd that more
women cheatedwithemotional attachmentthan
men, and thatwomen were more accepting of the
idea of an open relationship than men.
Doe and her two freshman friends, Tiana

Rodwell and Brittany Felder, said theythinkmost
women cheat in different ways than men. None
of thethreewomen said theyhad cheated, butall
said theythoughtmostwomen approach inﬁdel-
ity deliberately. '

“It’ll happen, girls cheat as much as guys do,”
Rodwell said. “Girls are just like ‘I don’t want to
get  t”’

Doe saidthatshehadseen girls cheat ontheir
boyfriends for emotional support rather than
physical comfort. '

“They’re:looking for that emotional comfort
that they’re not getting from their current boy-
friend,” Doe said.  ‘ ‘

Formen, the motivation seemstobeditferent.
Anderson said that as men became accustomed
totheir girlfriends, thefrequency and intensity of
sexdeclines. He saidthat menstillwant sex, even
though they can’t get itto theirsatisfactionintheir
relationship. Atthe same time, thesocialexpecta-
tion of monogamy—- alongwith their emotional
attachmentto their girlﬁ-iends——p_ushedthemto
stay in the relationship.

“The biological sidewantstocheatwith some-
one else, and the emotional side says ‘Hell no, I
don’t want to cheat,”’ Anderson said.

Thefearoflonelinessalsoseemstokeeppeople

Frieze said, “Somepeople don’tliketobealone

Hausmanaddedthatacheaterprobablyhears A
the “don’t do it” voice in his or her head during

the act. ,

“You’d just go ‘shut up, shut up, shut up,”’ he
said jokingly.

Both Hausman and DiGiulio believed female
students might cheat for different reasons than
male students. ,

Hausman thought girls pondered more about
cheatinginadvance and might go outforthe night
with the intention of cheating.

“Girls justify cheating diﬁ'erent_ly,” the anony-
mous male student said, addingthatthe feelingof
neglect might play abigger role.

‘john Student” said his girlﬁiend cheated on
himwhen hewasstudyingabroad. V.

“whentheyfeelunhappyorneglected, theybe—
ginto look elsewheretoﬁnd someonewho can gve
them that reassurance,” Student said. “It doesn’t
matterto themthat it isn’t their boyfrien ”

Distance seemed to be a major player in de-
cisions to commit an act considered cheating.
Notbeingnear asigniﬁcant other might increase
dissatisfaction with the current relationship and
increase the likelihood one might cheat.

‘iApartnerbeingawaycanalsobeimportant,”
Frieze said.

Another student at Pit1,]ames Keefer, said he
hated cheaters. But he became one after his ﬁrst
real girlfriend cheated onhim. He saidthe stress
of college, availability of partners and partyingall
could contribute to cheating.

Still, distance played the biggest role for him.

“I’ve never cheated on a girl in the same area
code as me,” Keefer said. I

TATMENT for
Bulimia N ervosa

Are you suffering from Bulimia Nervosa?
 
The University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center announces a
_ new clinical psychotherapy trial
for bulimia nervosa (BN). This
study will compare two
different ways to deliver
cognitive-behavioral therapy
(CBT), which is the treatment of
choice for BN. Patients will be
assigned by chance to either
face to face group CBT or an
interact-delivered CBT with a
therapist-moderated chat
group. There is no cost for
participating in this trial. lf you
are 18 years or older and have a
home computer with internet
access, you may be eligible.

ules again,” Chan said. From a researcher’s
perspective, Chan believes that LDRs depend
on a number of factors, including commit-
ment, trust, the amount of time apart and the
amount of time expected to be apart.

New technology like Skype and instant

I messaging can also complicate long—distance

relationships by providing partners with too
many options to keep in touch with each
other, thus creating unrealistic expecta-
tions forconstant communication between
partners. V

A study published in the journal “Com—
munication Research” last year by Laura
Stafford, a professor at the University of

«Kentucky, suggested that people in long-

distance relationships tend to avoid difﬁcult
subjects that mightcause friction in the re-
lationship. V

Chan said that even with Skype, partners -

can’t really experience what their signiﬁcant
others are going through unless they are
physically there with them.

“In general, LDRs are not meant for long
term but can be short term. Ideally, face-to-
face contact needs to be there — like being

‘part of a team -— to make it work,” Chan

said.

Greg Siegle,'an associate professor in the
psychiatry department at Pitt, spends con-
siderable time on Skype. He said that because
'of the way people’s emotions interact with

_their vision, it can be difﬁcult for couples
to achieve the same level of communica-

tion online that they might when physically
together.
He said thatsince relationships need pos-

itive communication to work, they might re- '

quire long-distance partners to consciously
introduce positive ideas into the relationship,

ratherthan letthem come .naturally,_   M y,

' Looking back at his one year apart from

, his then-girlfriend whom he has since mar-

ried, Siegle said, “We would communicate

. through IM, without which I don’t think we
would be married now. After we reunited, we

felt like we-knew more about each other than

we’d have if we hadn’t been apart.”.- _
At the same time, Clapp said that the lack

of face-to-face interaction almost always

causes some rocky moments in a relation-
ship.

“The slightest thing can cause aﬁght when
you text, and it escalates quickly,” Clapp said.
“¥ou must work through the problems or the
relationship won’t survive because you can’t
just have make—up sex.” _ '

There are advantages to, having a long-
distance relationship, though. ‘

When she was still in her long-distance
relationship, Clapp said that she had more
time to just veg out when she needed to.

There is no balancing act between boy-
