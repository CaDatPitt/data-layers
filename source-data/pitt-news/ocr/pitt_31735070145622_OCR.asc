Pittsburgh recognizes Persian newyear

' SeveralbranchesofU.S.andlocalgov-

emment .—— including Pittsburgh’s
City Council —— have reached out
to Iranians to recognize Nowruz, a

' holiday which commemoratesthe

Persian new year and the ﬁrst day
of spring.

Iranian Pitt students and mem- ‘

bers of the community celebrated the
holiday Friday night ataceremony at

the City- County Building, followed by '

a dinner and dance in the ballroom

of the William Pitt Union. Persian
Panthers of Pitt, the Persian Student
Organization of Carnegie Mellon and
the Iranian-American Cultural As-
sociation of Pittsburgh sponsored
the events. . V

Amirreza Masoumzadeh, presi-
dent of Persian Panthers, said the
organization was founded in spring '
2008 and has about 140 students and
members of the community on its‘
mailing list.

Twenty-two international Iranian
students are enrolled at Pitt, accord-
ing to Pitt’s 2010 Fact Book, and
Masoumzadeh said other members

MILWAUKEE —- The game was
following along the same path as

last year.

It was back and forth‘ for the
ﬁrst 13 minutes, and then Xavier
went on a big run to end the half.
The Pitt men’s basketball team
played from behind for nearly
the entire second period and-had
a chance to Win at the end, just like
when the teams met in last year’s
Sweet 16.

But this rematch took ‘a left
turn in its ﬁnal minute. Instead
of Pitt’s late—game heroics swish-
ing through the basket, the ball

clanked off the rim twice, and the

Panthers’ season came to an abrupt

are U.S. residents or citizens who are
not here on a student visa.

The major. goal of the group, he
said, is to provide an understanding
of Iranian culture and help bring unity

to Iranian students at Pitt, some of .

whom are away from their families.
Although the group tries to stay
apolitical, he said some members
were involved in protesting the”Ira-
nian presidential elections lastjune.
The group did distribute wristbands
to “show solidarity,” he said.
Masoumzadeh, who is from
Mashhad in northeastern Iran, came

to Pitt in fall 2007 to complete a doc-

end when they lost to Xavier 71-68
in the second round of the NCAA
Tournament yesterday. c

In a season that saw miracu-
lous comebacks against Louisville
and West Virginia and a buzzer-
beating, game—winning 3-pointer
against Providence, it was only
ﬁtting that Pitt ended the season
with another last-minute come-
back. Unlike the others, this one
fell short. ,

~Pitt trailed by seven with" 27
seconds remaining, but Gilbert
Brown hit two 3-pointers to pull
Pitt within three.

When Xavier inbounded the
ball, Brown was the only Panther
player around to foul Terrell Hol-
loway. Brown had no choice but to
take his ﬁfth foul and head to the

toral degree in information science.
He said the group also hosts other

‘traditional Iranian celebrations, such

as Yalda, a winter solstice holiday, as
well as movie nights and a backgam-
mon tournament.

He said he ﬁnds the Pitt com-
munity to be very diverse, although
sometimes Iranian students encoun-
ter prejudice because of the tense
U.S.-Iran political relationship.

“I especially ﬁnd the society here
very diverse compared to European
countries,” Masournzadeh said. “So
I think that yes, there is [prejudice]
to some degree, but that’s mostly

bench. Holloway made both free
throws, and again it looked like
Pitt was done.

On the ensuing possession, Tra-
Von Woodall made a layup with
8 seconds remaining to pull the
Panthers back within three.

When Xavier inbounded the
ball, it was tipped to the corner.
A scramble by both teams ended-
with the ball out of bounds. One
referee signaled that it was Pitt’s
ball, and the Pitt faithful in atten-
dance roared.

But another referee overturned
the call, giving it to Xavier, and
Xavier’s much larger crowd
drowned out the Panther fans.

Again, it looked like Pitt was

done. But Dante Jackson missed .

both free throws after being fouled

because all the media attention is on
the political disputes. And that’s how
people’s minds are shaped.”

Celebrating renewed life

Nowruz, which means “new day” ‘
in Farsi, dates back at least 3,000
years to ancient Persians who cel-
ebrated the ﬁrst day of spring. The
holidaywas one of the major festivals
forzoroastrianism, the main religion
of ancient Persia. A

Persians ‘celebrate by jumping fire  

Nowruz 4 1

ancient Persians believed that their

ancestors would come to visit them ,

on the ﬁrst day of spring each year.

But when it became an official
holiday of the Achaemenid dynasty,
which ruled Persia and many parts
ofthe world duringthe 500s to 300s
B.C., Nowruz became a holiday cel-
ebrated throughout the empire,
Greco said. During this era, kings
from different regionsin the Persian
empire brought gifts to the emperor
on Nowruz.

It’s now celebrated throughout
the world, especially inother Central
Asian countries. .

Greco, a senior manager of profes-
sional relations for pharmaceutical
company GlaxoSmithKline, came
to the United States from‘ Tehran in

1985. She said Nowruz symbolizes a T

rebirth of nature, the sacredness of
life and new beginnings.

Rituals can differ from family to
family, but Nowruz consists of three
important days over a three—week pe-
riod, Omid Moghimi, a Pitt junior,
said at the City Council presentation
Friday. ' '

On the last Wednesday of the Per-
sian calendar year — before Nowruz
— the familywill clean the house and

make a ﬁre to burn clutter. This is ,

called Chaharshanbe Suri.

They will jump over a smaller
ﬁres, symbolizing leaving grudges
and baggage behind and “absorbing
life from the ﬁre,” Greco said.

The actual day of N owruz is on the
ﬁrst day of spring at the exact time of
the vernal equinox, which was 1:32
p.m. on Saturday this year. Tradition-

! ally, people wear new clothes.

Finally, Sizdah Be-dar takes place
on the 13th day of the new year, or 12
days after Nowruz, Moghimi said.
Iranian families celebrate the day
outside, and usually this is the last
day of a two-week break from work
or school.

People of different religions cel-
ebrate Nowruz, said Bahar Fata, a
31-year-old bioengineering graduate
student from Tehran. Fata’s family is
practices the Baha’i faith, which was
founded inthe 1800s with the intent

of unifying all people and religions, j

she said.

Nowruz reinforces bonds

Nowruz 4 4

Fata said families place their own religious
books, such as the Quran, on a Nowruz display
table. At the celebration in the Union, they set
up a table with a book by Persian poet Hafez,
which symbolized knowledge and learning,
Fata said.

The Union Nowruz display also included a
mirror, two candles, a pot of hyacinths, wheat
grass and bowls of goldﬁsh, apples, garlic, date-
like fruits, coins and vinegar.

Fata said these items, seven of which start
with the Farsi letter “s,” symbolize different
hopes for the new year. For instance, garlic
represents health and medicine, coins repre-
sent prosperity and the vinegar symbolizes
age and wisdom. Nowruz tables also typically
include colored eggs, sin1ilar to Christian Easter
traditions.

At the exact time of the equinox, families
dress up and join their relatives around the
table. One person ﬁ'om the family picks up the
holy book, and the family prays and meditates,
Fata said.

Behdad Beheshti, a22-year-old bioengineer-
ing doctorate student from Tehran, said that
Nowruz is not as special of a ritual in the capital
city as it might be inthe Iranian countryside and
that his family doesn’t have speciﬁc traditions
on the holiday.

“The most important thing is to see family
and relatives,” Beheshti said.

Beheshti, a member of the Persian Panthers,
said many Iranian students in the United States
come from Tehran because it is the country’s
cultural and educational center. g

A new political beginning

Greco attended the City Council ceremony
commemorating Nowruz.

“It was a special day for all of us because a
lot of times, we are viewed through the lens of
our govemment,” Greco said.

The U.S. House of Representatives also
passed a Nowruz Resolution lastweek, express-
ing appreciation to the U.S. Iranian community
and recognizing the holiday.

Despite Iranian President Mahmoud Ah-
madinejad’s reputation as a Holocaust denier,
Greco emphasized that Iranians have “lived
peaceﬁilly with minorities,” including Jews,
Assyrians, Kurds, Turks, Armenians and
Baha’is.

President Barack Obama chose to address
Iran last Saturday and on last year’s Nowruz
as well.

“One year ago, I chose this occasion to speak , _

directly to the people and leaders of the Islamic
Republic of Iran, and to offer a new chapter of
engagement on the basis of mutual interests.
and mumal respect,” Obama said inthe address,

available on the White House website. “I did so

with no illusions.”

In the address, Obama dismissed Iran’s de-
velopment of nuclearlweapons as well as the
country’s much publicized presidential election
lastjune, in which many Iranians accused the
incumbent Ahmadinejad administration of elec-

tion fraud. The protest movement was largely a
social networking one —— many Iranians used
Twitter, Facebook and YouTube to protest and
spread information about the elections.

Acknowledgingpast grievances between the
United States and Iran, Obama asked the Iranian
government to “tell us what you’re for.”

He said increasing the U.S. commitment
to U.S.-Iranian education exchange and com-
munication technology will “enable them to
communicate with each other and with the
world without fear of censorship.”

Health bill needs
tort reform

Without tort reform, medicine is less lucrative

 
  

Abdul- Kareem Ahmed
Asst. Opinions Editor

The doctor is traditionally seen as
a prominent ﬁgure, a high society
type donning a white coat, sporting
astethoscope across the shoulder and
— do not forget — jingling the keys
to his Bentley as he strolls out of the
hospital. That man is 

But, more often, that man is a
stereotype. Few specialties afford a
doctor that life, and recent events
prove that window is closing for all
doctors.

Last night, the House ofRepresen-
tatives approved the Senate version
of President Barack Obarna’s health
care overhaul, with a reconciliation
package pending.

The health care bill and a 2002-
enacted law will change the future of
the physician profession irrevocably.
Two major items concern doctors,
Medicare payments and tort reform.
One thing is sure: Premedical and
medical students will need to decide
if this reality is what they thought it
would be.

For primary care physicians, the
health care bill is a blessing because
it includes an increase in Medicare
payments to this ﬁeld speciﬁcally.
However, other specialties will not
beneﬁt from this and in fact will face
a21 percent cutinMedicare payments
from the separate 2002 law, the post-
ponement of which will end soon..

Regardless of the advantage pri-
mary care physicians will receive, a
majority of physicians still face real
payment cuts and all face the same
malpractice insurance they’ve been
paying, from lack of tort reform.

Tort is a negligent or intentional
civil wrong not arising out of a con-
tract or statute. The act injures a per-
son in a way that allows him or her
to seek compensation of some sort
for it. In medicine, these legal injuries

are a grayarea, and patients canbring
their grievancestothe court. Doctors
pay malpractice insurance to cover

such legal expenses. It’s a literal cut ~

intheir salary.
Doctors make good money —
gross income that is. The average

physician salary across different ﬁelds
in the U.S. ranges from $122,603 to
$255,343 in more lucrative ﬁelds, ac-
cordingto payscale.com. Still, all doc-
tors needto see tortreforrn, and some

non-primary care doctors could not

handle a 21 percent payment cut.

To put these numbers in perspec-
tive, the average debt of medical gradu-
ates of 2009 was $156,456, according
to the American Medical Association.
Tuition has increased a daunting 50
percent from 1984 to 2004, not fol-

lowed by a similar trend in salary. —

Doctors also payhefty malpractice in-
surance. Therefore, the gross income
a specialty is tagged with is not all it

seems. Consequently, malpractice is

a relatively major expense.

In an interview with The Sarato-
gian, U.S. Rep. Scott Murphy, D-Glens
Falls, N.Y., said, “One thing we didn’t
do nearly enough on is tort reform.
This bill makes small steps toward
tort reform, but they are not enough”
inregard to the bill. »

The Harvard School of Publi
Health recently found that 40 per-
cent of medical malpractice suits
are without merit, in the U.S. These
frivolous cases costAmericansbillions
of dollars armually. Additionally, the
Massachusetts Medical Societyfound
that 83 percent of its doctors order
unnecessary, expensive tests and pro-
cedures infear ofbad medical practice
and the lawsuits and insurance hikes
thatwould promptly follow. Not only
is malpractice an excessive expense to
doctors, but to the public in general.

There is no health care reform
without tort reform, but the House
is undeterred.

Universal health care and removal
of discrimination againstpatients with
pre-existing conditions sounds dandy
on paper. But the doctors need to be
tended to as well. Congress should re-
consider payment cuts, and the health
carebill should be made to reﬂectthe
vital needfortort reform, for doctors
and for Americans. .

A doctor, especially in a less spe-
cialized ﬁeld, is not asking to live the
highlife. He justwantsto make living
with his profession a sound choice.

A MIDWESTERN PIECE

Pittsburgh must learn

rom Chicago’s past 2  

 
   
  

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

The city of Chicago is a story of the
rapid creation of something where

there was once nothing. A mere 175 A

years ago, there was nothing of im-
portance where the Chicago River
ﬂows into Lake Michigan. The entire
area was a lonely swamp that took
its name after the Algonquin word
for “Place of the Wild Onion.” Then
came aboom, aﬁre, 150 years of cor-

ruption,aﬂood andtheviolentdeath ~

A of two mayors. Much can be learned
from the example of Chicago, and
Pittsburgh is about to follow in its

A footsteps.

Pittsburgh is seriously in debt,
and has a pension ﬁind that is aﬁind
mostly in theory. This is why Mayor
Luke Ravenstahl wanted to soak us
suckers who go to school in Pitts-.
burgh. After angry grousingfrom the

universities in the area, the mayor
backed down and came up with an-
other bright idea: leasing the city
parking meters and parking garages
to private ﬁrms. Chicago does this,
and from my experience as adenizen
of Cook County, it is a terrible idea.

First and foremost, the lease
would be a one-time revenue boost to
the city instead of a constant income
stream. Essentially, the city would
be betting interest rates that would
be favorable over the long term of
the lease, and that the money gained
by the lease wouldn’t all’ be spent at
once, and that the interest gained by
saving the money would be enough
to continue covering future pension
obligations, and that the city would
invest the money wisely, and that
it wouldn’t disappear into some of-
ﬁcial’s pocket. This last one is more
a problem for Chicago, but it could
happen here too. It is diﬂicult to say
whether the bet will pay off

Even if the bet does pay off, there

are other major issues. Most obvi-
ously, and most odiously,- privatiza-
tion in Chicago has led to a rapid in-
crease in parking meter rates, which
has provoked considerable outrage
in Illinois. According tothe Chicago
Sun Times, parkinga car in the Loop,
downtown, now requires 28 quar-
ters for 2 hours, and the rates were
expected to quadruple from what
they were before by2o13. Something

very strange happened when these -

meters had the rate increase. You
could now ﬁnd parking downtown,
rather than engaginginthe “Chicago
500,” circlingthe block until you ﬁnd
a space. However, there is a price to
be paid. .
This increase in parking fees has
real unintended consequences, like
any other measure thatis too clever
by half. Between the high cost of
parking and the 10.25% sales tax,
who wants to drive into the city to
shop? Yes, public transportation is
an answer, but when more people get

LEWIS LEHE ENDORSES THINGS

Spring brings Punxsutawney memories

 
   

Lewis Lehe
Columnist

Today I endorse Groundhog Day.

In its own mythical sense, it deter-
mines winter’s end, and thus,’ spring’s
dawn. I had to see it for myself.

0nFeb. 2, at1 a.m., Irealizedlwas
ignorant ofhow much more winter we
would have. So, I swallowed a 5—Hour
Energy drink and hit the road with
my ﬁiend Rob.

At3:30 a.m., we navigated atrafﬁc

jam through downtown Punxsutaw-
ney. Itisweirdtobeinatraﬂicjamin
a rural area, especially so early in the
morning, and itis even weirder to do it
on atandem unicycle, but forumately
we were not on a tandem unicycle.

Alter parking, I stepped out into
the cold. The wintrywind blew so cold
that I was forced to warm up with an
extra pair ofpants, an extra hat, and
anextralarge amotmt of alcohol. Then,
once we were too warm to drive, Rob
andlboarded a yellow school bus that
drove out to Gobblers Knob, where we

were toldthe actionwould happen, just
as it always does atplaces with names
like Gobblers Knob.

It turned out that Gobblers Knob
was aﬁeld atthe edge of a snowywood,
andtheairovertheﬁeldwasthickwith
steamy breath and disco music. The
overhead lights illuminated thousands
of men, women and children — all
wrapped up in coats and hats — shuf-
fling stiffly betweena stage, abonﬁre
and two snack vendors. On the stage,
girls in oversized, neon-colored top
hats danced in front of the majestic
stump that housed Punxsutawney
Phil. Atthe bonﬁre, people huddled to
warmup, although itwas the laughing,
snifﬂing crowd, compressed around
the ﬁre that provided the operative
heat

At the vendors, people lined up to
buy coffee, hot dogs and super—sweet
hot chocolate at prices ﬁxed barely
above cost, even though, freezing and
stranded, we were as ransomed as Six
Flags patrons paying four dollars for
bottled water. Overall, Gobblers Knob
exempliﬁed the communal enthusi-
asm that makes Pennsylvania a com-

monwealth instead of a state.

Iobserve you Pennsylvanians, and
I’ve noticed that just like blood coagu-
lates in open air, Pennsylvanians with
free time spontaneously coalesce into
clumps of traditions, committees and
delegated responsibilities. The First
Continental Congress, Jehovah’s Wit-
nesses, and the Whiskey Rebellion are
all good examples. The Inner Circle
is another.

The Inner Circle is a group of ﬁf-
teen men — including businessmen,
teachers, construction workers, and
ﬁmeral parlorproptietors —who bear
the sacred responsibilities of plarming
Groundhog Day, caringfor Punxsutaw-
ney Phil, and wearing top hats. The
members have nicknames that seem
like mixes between Native American
names andAmerican Gladiator names
— Native American Gladiators, may-
be. Edjekielekis Storm Chaser. Butch
Philliber’s nickname is Ice Man.

The President of the Inner Circle,
Bill Deely, doesn’t seem to have anick—
name, but he does have the power to
administerthe elixir oflife thathas sus-
tained Punxsutawney Phil for over 100

years. He also brandishes a cane that
lets him understand groundhogese.

Somethingelsetorememberabout
Pennsylvaniais that itis aswingstate.
No one ever knows which candidate
will win its electoral votes. And even
when a Republican like Arlen Spec-
ter wins, he might swing around and
become a Democrat. But few states
go as far as Pennsylvania, where the
beginning of spring is a swing issue
that comes down to one vote.

Before I went, I assumed the
groundhog was a weather vane. But
Punxsutawney Phil just pays homage
to the shadow myth’s naive climatic

, determinism. TherealityisthatPunx-

sutawney Phil controls the onset of
spring.

' But we can inﬂuence him. The
Groundhog Day festivities began at
3:30 a.m., but Punxsutawney Phil
didn’t prognosticate until 7:30 a.m.,
so we had fourhours to lobby the Seer
of Seers, Prognosticator of Prognos-
ticators. “Phil! Phil! Phil!” the people
chanted. Some carried signs that
read, “Six more weeks!” Other signs
demanded a sooner spring.

Finally, Mr. Deely pulled Phil out of
the stump and liftedthe chubby, brown
mass high above his head, for all to
see. “Everyt.hingthe lighttouches,” he
seemed to say, “produces a shadow.”
Sure enough, Phil saw his quivering
little shadow splayed across the top of

Pittsburgh endured its snowiest Febru-
ary on record.

" Afterward, everyone met the
press. Dozens of reporters stormed
the stage to interview Thunder Con-
ductor, Stump Warden and The Big
Windmaker. I climbed up and got a pic-
ture with actor Stephen Tobolowsky,
who played the annoying insurance
salesman Ned Ryerson in the movie
Groundhog Day.

Before leaving, I looked into Phil’s
little plastic terrarium. He peeked
out through a wad of grass and whis-
pered something: “You won’t write
your article about this until the ﬁrst
day of spring.” And, once again, Phil
was right.

on the buses and trains, this might
not be an attractive option.

There are other options that al-
low you to take your car. Who says
you have to go Downtown to shop?
Where I’m from, you can drive north
to a shopping mall just across the
county line, where parking is free,
and the sales taxes are lower. I don’t
spend any money in Chicago, even
though I live barely ﬁve miles outside
the city limit.

High parking rates have the very

real potential of damaging mer-
chants who will see fewer custom-
ers unwilling to park at high rates.
This means lower sales tax revenue
for Chicago. So, in the long run, it
is unclear how much the city re-
ally “made” by privatizing meters.
Indeed, the city inspector general
estimates that the city lost millions
of dollars by this deal, according to
the Chicago Tribune.

There were other problems aside
from money—related ones. Broken

parking meters go unrepaired more
often. 250 of the vaunted “pay-and-
display” parking meters, which
are computerized boxes that col-
lect the parking fee and print out
a time-stamped sticker you put in

your window to avoid a ticket, broke

downtown on May 27 of last year.
The machines jam from having so
many quarters put in them, and from
not having those quarters regularly
emptied. Because “pay—and—dis—
play” means no freebie parking for

a busted meter, one has to hurry to
ﬁnd a functioning box before being
ticketed.

What about those tickets? Aren’t
they a great income source for the
city? True, but 72 percent of tickets
contested in court were thrown out
after the fare hike, a 4 percent in-
crease. If Pittsburghers get feisty,
tickets might not be a great revenue
source anymore.

Chicago can set a very clear ex-
ample for Pittsburgh in the case of

For parking, privatization not all it’s cracked up to be

meter privatization. It is a case study
of why the endeavor is a disaster. Chi-
cago has committed to the deal for
the next 75 years, meaning denizens
of Cook County will be irritated for
a long time. However, here in Pitts-
burgh, there is still hope. We must
urge the City Council to reject Mayor
Ravenstahl’s plan for a quick ﬁx that
will cause a great deal of damage.

CULINARY FEATURE

 

Cookin’ up recipes, advice

— Gainesville State College student reaches Pitt kitchens through 'YouTube cookingshows

Sierra Starks
Senior Staﬁ’ Writer

Gainesville State College student Ar-
thur King is on a mission to prove to
college students everywhere that’ra-
men noodles, frozen dinners and fast
food aren’t their only options.

The ﬁrst college student he con-
vinced was his girlfriend, who then

= suggested that he start his own cook-

ingshow.

Thus began Cookin’ For College, a
website “showing the ease of cooking
real meals, which cost little and taste
 t,7

A few days a week, King posts
videos of him making dishes in a
fashion similar to ones you can ﬁnd
on the Food Network. He sets up his
ingredients, turns the camera on and
heats up the kitchen, providing step-
by-step commentary as he develops
his masterpiece.

His entrees include Grilled Cheese
Hamburgers, S’more Pancakes and
Teriyaki Bacon Wrapped Pork
Chops.

While these dishes seem far-
fetched and impossible to make, King
simpliﬁes the process so that anyone
can be a master chef just by watching
and following directions.

“I think there are a lot of college
kids out there who have no idea how
to cook,” King explained his reason
for beginning the Cookin’ For College

MOVIE ANALYSIS

website.

“Cooking intimidates students be-
cause they’ve never really done it for
themselves. And so they live offthings
like ramen noodles,” King said. He as-
sures that food choices like packaged
noodles get old quickly.

Kingﬁgures that since he’s already 
well educatedinculinaryarts, he might ’

aswell share that knowledge with oth-
ers.

Food has always been a passion
of King’s family. Many members of
his family are either in the restaurant
business or are “just good cooks.”
King learned to cook from his father
who has opened two restaurants in
his lifetime.

Therefore, when King began col-
lege and moved into his own apart-
ment, cooking for himselfwas just a
continuation of his routine at home.

However, accordingto King, most
college students lack the experience
and the conﬁdence to be successﬁil
in the kitchen.

Along with King, students at the
University ofPittsburgh have also rec-
ognized the need for culinary educa-
tion in the lives of college students.
Tower C Resident Assistants teamed
up with PantherWELL, a peer health
education program at Pitt, to host an
eventinhonor of alternative eating on
campus. The program, “What’sinyour
Microwave?” highlighted quick, easy
and healthy dishes to make from the

comfort of your dorm room.

Rosalie Traﬁcante, one of the
Tower C RAs who hosted the program,
says she contacted PantherWELL be-

cause it was something her residents
wanted.

V “It was nice to give the students
an alternative to buying fast food,”
she said. ‘

Traﬁcante explained that students
made the mistake of constantly eat-
ing out and eating more than their
fair share in the University cafeterias
ﬁrst semester. She and her fellow RAs

wanted their; residents to know that
“it’s betterto cook for yourselfsome-
times.” I

“A lot of students just don’t know
how simple it is,” Traﬁcante said about
making quick, healthy dishes in the
microwave. “Once simplicity is con-
veyed, then students will have more
conﬁdence to cook for themselves.”

King’s girlfriend, Kira Glasser, who
also serves as his public relation rep
and camerawoman, says she’s gained
much more conﬁdence justbywatch—
ing King in the kitchen.

“I can get in the kitchen now and
I’m not intimidat ,” she said. “I can
use spices and try to create my own

Glasserhas come alongway from
ﬁrstarrivingincollege. Shewas simply
uneducated and overwhelmed when
it came to preparing food for herself,
she said.

“I used to buy lots of frozen din-
ners,” she said, adding that they are
stillinthe freezer, untouched. '

“Yes, Cookin’ For College shows
cheap and easymeals, but it also helps
[students] gain the conﬁdence nec-
essary to do more for themselves,”
Glasser said. “People who wanthome
cooked meals should be able to make
them.”

King hopes to one day start a res-
taurant of his own like his father. His
most recent project is a Cookin’ Fo
College cookbook. I

Films about icons struggle with longevity

Andy Tybout
Columnist

The all—female rock group The Run-
aways was formed in 1975, and dis-
bandedbeforethe’80s.Itsﬁrst singles
were broadcastbefore Regan took of-
ﬁce. Its most famous member, Joan
Jett, is old enough to be my mother.
Despite the band’s age, it remains
popular decades later. The question
is, can the newly released ﬁlm “The
Runaways”—orany music biopic, for

that matter — have the same brand
of longevity?

It’s aquestion I’ve been pondering
ever since the release of the ﬁctitious
biopic “Crazy Heart.” Heading back
from a screening a few months back,
my friend and I tried, and failed, to
think of music biopics that had gone
on to become classics. Countless
standouts came to mind — “Ray,”
“Walk the Line” — but we were at a
loss when it came to ﬁlms that had
endured in the public mindset beyond

a year or two.

I’ll get to the reason, but ﬁrst, a
quick disclaimer: slice—of-life mov-
ies like “A Hard Day’s Night” (1964)
and documentaries are exempt from
the curse. Legendary concert ﬁlms
like “Stop Making Sense” (Talking
Heads) or up—close-and-personal
examinations like “Gimme Shelter”
(The Rolling Stones) are savored for
decades to come.

But not biopics. Which, for a
time, baffled me -— why did these

ﬁne ﬁlms so easily disintegrate from

memory?

The answer canbe found, surpris-
ingly enough, in “Walk Hard: The
Dewey Cox Story” (2007). Ostensibly
it’s aparody of “Walkthe Line” (2005),
but really, it’s a searing, and hilari-
ous, indictment of all music biopics
ever made. With sardonic ease, the
ﬁlm matriculates through the vari-
ous motions of the genre —— a tragic

childhood, drugs, reuniting with an

old ﬂame -— and by the end, you get

the sense that you’ve just watched a '

thousand movies in one.

Which is troubling — if modern
music biopics were so similarthatthey
could be mixed and matched without
detriment to the story. It’s no wonder,
then, thatthey might easily evaporate
from memotyinahaze offormulaand
convention.

Of course, this might say as much
about the musicians as it does the
ﬁlms — experimentation, booze, and
old ﬂames are inarguably recurrent

VIDEO GAME REVIEW

Game pits ‘Aliens versus
Predators,’ players Win

F1'xrst— person shooter video game a solid play »

Kieran Layton
A&E Editor

“Aliens vs, Predator”
Sega '
Xbox 360
First-person shooter
Grade: B+

Taking two of the most successful and
widely recognized science fiction fran-
chises ever made and combining them to

 

 

make a kind of mega franchise is a move
that shouldn’t require much second—guess-
ing. Though the mediums ofthe “Alien vs.
Predator” include comic books, novels
and two feature films, the video games are

‘ generally considered to be the highpoint
4 of the series. ‘

Now, nine years after the last true “AVP”
game was‘ released, Sega has released a
remake for the Xbox 360 (as well as Play-
station 3 and PC), and thoughit may not
offer any striking innovations to the first-
person shooter genre, it’s an entertaining

and atmospheric game equally enjoyable

when played alone or with others. A

species that you decide to pick, though all
three occur within the same basic story
frame. As the Alien, you’ll run around try-
ing to sneak upon unsuspecting Marines
and eat their faces (literally). The Predator
campaign offers a more brutish, typical
first-person shooter experience, while
the Marine campaign incorporates more
survival-horror elements before becoming
similar to the Predator missions.

Because, you know, humans don’t really
measure up against ravenous, terrifying
monster aliens. '

The graphics are excellent, with char-

impressive — as the Alien and Predator,
you try to stick to the dark spots to provide
maximum surprise on your victims, but
as the Marine, the darkness ramps up the
suspense, and'you never quite know what

themes in the lives of artists. But is it so hard to
ﬁnd an interesting, original way to convey the
story of a person’s life?
Some biopics have. “I’m Not There” (2007), l

the experimentalﬁlm on Bob Dylan, features six

ary songwriter. “Thirty Two Short Films About
Glenn Gould” (1993) is a schizophrenic, often

whﬂe known primarily for its amazing lead
performance by Marion Cotillard, flirts with
experimental narrative structure. These are, in
the conventional sense, wildly different movies,
but they’re united by a shared virtue: they’re
memorable. ‘ i

that even remotely break the supposedly “tried
and true” laws of the genre, butwhen they do —
as “Friday Night Lights” (2004) did for sports
and “Unforgiven” (1992) did forWesterns —‘ the
results are often spectacular — and timeless.
Yes, fanboys might get up in arms ifyou start-
ed splicing up theirfavorite musician’s life story.
Yes, it’d probably make the ﬁlm less marketable.

'Butwith the right direction, the right insight, and

ofcourse, the rightperformances, experimental
biopics are destined to take their place amongst
the great pioneers of genre. .

Who knows?—Maybe song is inherently more
endearingthan ﬁlm. Maybe you can only ﬁddle
so much with a person’s life and still convey its
meaning. But until more ﬁlmmakers take a
chance, The Runaways’ story will be remem-
bered solely through their music.

Pitt wrestler finishes 5th at championships

Sophomore All-American Tyler Naurnan’s victories highlight Panthers ’ participation in the NCAA championships.

Torie Wytiaz
Stajfwri ter

Before sophomore Tyler Nauman
even took the matfor his ﬁnal day
ofwrestling in the NCAA champi-
onships, he had already accom-
plished something every wrestler
sets out to do.

In his ﬁrst two days of action,
the No. 10-seeded Nauman re-
corded three consecutive victo-
ries, including a major win over
the No. 2 seed Jamal Parks of
Oklahoma State, at the season-
end tournament held in Omaha,
Neb.

With this 5-3 decision, Nauman
earned a place in Pitt wrestling
history by becorningthe ﬁfth All-
American in the program in the

_ last four seasons.

The ﬁnal day of the champion-
ships allowed Nauman to close out
a year inwhich he went 18-0 in the
dual meet season and captured
the Eastern Wrestling League title
in the 141-pound weight class.

After a 3-2 loss to No. 5 seed
Zack Bailey of Oklahoma, Nauman

rebounded to secure a victory in
the ﬁﬁzh-place match against Ger-
mane Lindsey of Ohio.

“We had a lot of positives this
weekend, but Nauman’s ﬁfth-
place ﬁnish was deﬁnitely the
highlight,” Head Coach Rande
Stottlemyer said. “Nauman is
one of those guys that wants to
go out there and ﬁght for a na-
tional title.”

Nauman was joined by ﬁve of
his teammates for the three—day
NCAA championship event.

Five of those six competitors
— Nauman, Anthony Zanetta,
Ryan Tomei, Matt Wilps and Zac
Thomusseit — qualiﬁed for the
tournament as a result of the Pan-
ther’s EWL team championship
victory. Redshirt senior Eric Al-
bright also represented Pitt team
by earning an at-large bid, giving
the Panthers their highest number
of participants in the champion-
ship since 2000.

While Nauman was the only
Panther to advance to the ﬁnal
round of championship play, the
other ﬁve Wrestlers contributed to
a successﬁil team performance.

Staﬁ" Writer

 

Thursday’s NHL game between the Pittsburgh
Penguins and the Boston Bruins had the mak-
ings of an instant classic.

Boston was going to be out for blood, still
angry over Penguins "winger Matt Cooke’s
blindside hit to Marc Savard’s head. Cooke was
not suspended, and seemed to avoid penaliza—
tion altogether — at least until Pittsburgh met
Boston again, or so it seemed..

Then add in Pittsburgh’s battle for the At-
lantic Division title and Boston’s ﬁght to keep
the last playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.
The result: the only time aH week the television
dial moved off March Madness.

Too bad it was a snore fest.

Boston mustered ﬁve shots on Marc—Andre
Fleury in the ﬁrst period. They ﬁnally broke
into double digits after 40 minutes. Pittsburgh
already led 2-0 by then. .

By the time the ﬁnal horn sounded, Fleury
earned one of the easier shutouts of his career,
a 17-save blanking in a 3-0 victory. .

Former Bruin Cam Neely said it best in
a radio interview with Boston radio station
WEEI Friday. “People expecttheir athletes to
compete and show that they care,” Neely said.
“I was disappointed last night.”

The Bruins are in ruins.

Boston did nothing to show they cared
about what Cooke did to its star player. At

this point, I can’t imagine the Bruins doing
anything in the playoffs.

It’s not that the Bruins didn’t go out and

slew-foot Sidney Crosby and then sucker-
punch Evgeni Malkin. Nobody expected that,
especially with the league watching the game
extra closely.

It’s that the Bruins didn’t hit anybody.
Tough guy Shawn Thornton challenged Cooke
to a ﬁght in the game’s second minute. After
that, the Bruins were the hockey equivalent
of the Washington Generals. '

An attendance of 17,565 people turned out
to see what should have been a playoff-level
hockey game. They booed every time Cooke
stepped on the ice. By the second period,
though, Cooke stood on the ice, and the fans

jeered for a different reason — Boston couldn’t
get out of its own zone for two minutes.

Neely said in the radio interview that
he wasn’t sure about the team’s leadership
anymore. It’s beyond that, though. You need
leaders to motivate you for a Wednesday
night game against Florida when it’s 83 and
sunny outside. Popping in “D2: The Mighty
Ducks” should have been enough. against
Pittsburgh. .

Everyone there wanted one thing, and
that was hitting. Instead they received 60
minutes of listless play. I’m sure most fans in
attendancewished they were watchingWash-
ington play Marquette in the NCAA Tourna-
ment because that’s what I ended up doing
after a while.

The Bruins have people who could’ve run

6' Panthers compete at nationals

Wrestling 4 13

“All of our guys put in a good effort and
fought hard,” Stottlemyer said. “The NCAA
championship is a new experience with a
lot of good competition, but we competed
and stayed focused.”

Zanetta, a true freshman, experienced
his ﬁrst national championship appearance
after ﬁnishing the regular season with a
record of 33-8 and the most victories on
the Pitt squad.

“For Zanetta to get this experience as
a freshman is very valuable,” Stottlemyer
said. “This tournament really presents a
challenge on and off the mat, so experi-
ence is key.”

In tournament play Zanetta defeated his
ﬁrst opponent, Andre Gonzalez of Cal State

Rande Stottlemyer:

ﬁrst match to N o. 2_Iohn Dergo of Illinois.
Thomusseit recovered to defeat the No. 12
seed Lehigh’s David Craig4—0, but it was not
enough to continue into the ﬁnal rounds.

As the lone senior representative on the
championship team, Albright ended his
Panthers career with two victories against
No. 12 seed Mario Mason of Minnesota in
overtime and Northern Iowa’s Trenton
Washington before losing to the fourth-
and ﬁfth—ranl<ed competitors in the 149-
pound division.

In analyzingthe performance of his Pitt
team at the championships, Stottlemyer
said that the ultimate goals are still unat-
tained. '

“Ideally, you want all of your team mem-

Rankings and previous season
accomplishments won't put wrestlers on those
podiums, but hard work and preparation will.

Fullerton, but fell to No. 3 Matt McDonough
of Iowa and No. 9]arrod Patterson of Okla-
homa to end his tournament run.

Tomei entered the tournament with
a No. 8 seed in the heavyweight division,
due in large part to his Victory in the EWL
championship and his team—leading 13 re-
corded falls.

Despite his season accomplishments,
Tomei suffered an early demotion to the
consolation rounds of the tournament af-
ter a loss to unranked Cameron Wade of
Penn State.

Nauman’s fellow sophomore Wlps began
the tournament with a spark as he defeated -»
the N o. 11 seed Patrick Bond of Illinois in an
upset, but two losses against the No. 6 and
No. 9 seeds in the 197-pound weight class
eliminated Wilps from ﬁnal play.

Thomusseit also struggled at the hands
of the ranked opponents and dropped his

  3?¥"@?.rT‘i’3‘%:.i§§"it"  

bers to stand on that podium, but with the
level of competition, that is not an easy
thing to do,” Stottlemyer said. “We won a
lot of matches at the tournament, but we are
still not quite at the level we aim for.”

Nevertheless, the NCAA championships
capped aPitt wrestling season that was full
of accolades, none perhaps as monumen-
tal as the long—awaited conference season
victory. Stottlemyer earned his ﬁrst EWL
re -season title alter coaching the Pan-
thers for 30 years.

Stottlemyer isn’t concerned with Pitt’s
ﬁrst regular—season title anymore, though,
as he’s already focusing on next year.

“This season is over and now we want to
prepare to put in a good summer of work,”
Stottlemyer said. “Rankings and previous
season accomplishments won’t put wres4
tlers on those podiums, but hard work and
preparation will.”

March Madness better thanBruins

Bruins 4 14

Pittsburgh through the boards. Milan Lucic
stands 6—foot—4, wéighs 220 pounds and ran
Mike Van Ryn through the glass last year. This
year he played like a 5-foot—8 center.

i They have the tallest NHLer ever in
6-foot-9 Zdeno Chara. Come on, he wrestled
when he was a kid. Did his ﬁght with Mike
Rupp in the second period inspire his team-
mates? Nope. Rupp scored Pittsburgh’s third
goal. Back to basketball I went.

In the one chance the Bruins had to put
Pittsburgh in hell for 60 minutes, they were
apparently content to let the Penguins do
whatever they wanted.

What happened to the scrappy Boston
team that came out of nowhere to win the
East last year? ’

Well, Lucic signed an extension that will
payhim $4 million next season, but the Bruins
traded 36-goal scorer Phil Kessel to Toronto
because they couldn’t afford to keep both. * _

Only Marco Sturm has 20 goals for Boston.
this year. -

Role player Byron Bitz could’ve roughed
up the Penguins on Thursday — except Bos—'
ton traded him to Florida at the deadline for
defenseman Dennis Seidenberg.

Come on, Boston, you were facing the
player that knocked out your best forward
possibly forthe rest of the season.

The Atlanta Thrashers and New York

FEW CAN BE MARINES.
EVEN FEW R CAN. LEAD THEM.

CAN YOU?

Rangers were breathing down your neck for
the last playoff spot. How do you lay an egg
against Pittsburgh?"

The Bruins apparently thought they could
ﬁght Cooke early in the game," and the Pen-
guins would pack up and leave. Nobody told
them they had to play for 58 more minutes.

’ They didn’t even have to win. As Neely said
Friday, “If they don’t win, [fans] are okay with

that as long as they compete, show that they

care and work hard.”
. Boston didn’t playlhard. They haven’t

played  in a long time. Instead of Savard’s
injury motivating them to play better in his
absence, they have rolled over. The Thrashers
now sit one point behind the Bruins for eighth
in the conference — and they too are playing
without their ex-superstar, Ilya Kovalchuk. ‘
Atlanta has shown heart. It’s like “Rudy,”
“D2,” or “Air Bud.” When you’re the underdog
_ or a basketball—playing dog, you step up your
game. The Thrashers know that. Northern
Iowa knows that, Boston, it seems, doesn’t
know that.
