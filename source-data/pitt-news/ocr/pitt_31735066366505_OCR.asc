vised its committee system for the coming trimester in an
attempt to promote more “interaction between board mem-

bers,” according to Loch.

John Smith, former vice-chairman of SUB and one of

the innovators of this program,
‘stated that the guiding motive
was to “block together ‘areas pre-
viously separated so that one per-
son can see a broader areal” He
commented that SUB was striv-
ing for “coordination of more
than one program” under the re-
spective chairmen. .
Chairing the new SUB will be
Joe Danowsky, a junior in lib_er-
al arts (LA). Danowsky, a politi-
cal science, major, is currently
president of I-IilleL He has also

‘X, been active in Pitt Players and

Cohen, in charge of public rela-
tions; Margaret Wolak, public af-
fairs; Mike Teller, social chair-
man; Judy Shangold, the arts;
and Sue Ashner, special interests.

Cohen, a former Glee Club '

member, ‘is an LA junior major-
ing in political science. Miss Wo-

lak, a freshman" in LA, is alsoa

political~ science major. In addi-
‘ tion to her participation in Hill
Education.Project (HEP) and
Young Republicans, Miss Wolak
is a Debate Scholar for William
Pitt Debating Union.

logy. A former special events
chairman, Teller was an active

NASA Gives
15 Awards

I For Space

For the second consecutive year,
the University has received 15
grants for space trainees. The
grants, from the National Aero-
nautics and Space Administration
(NASA), are for the predoctoral
graduate training program dur-
ing the 1966-67 academic year.

The maximum number of grants
received by any institution in a

single year is 15; the minimum_

is two. In all, 152 colleges and
universities received the grants
for a total of 1,335 predoctoral
students.

The University also received
the maximum 15 grants last year.
With the new grants, the total of
NASA-supported predoctoral stu-
dents at the University increases
to 52.

The predoctoral programis one
phase of NASA’s effort to sup-
port basic research and to ﬁll
the nation’s needs for highly

A trained scientists and engineers.

The program is administered un-
der the University's Space Re-
search and Coordination Center.

Each appointee will receive a’

stipend of $2,400 for 12 months
of training with an additional al-
lowance (up to $1,000 a year) for
dependents. If a student ‘main-
tains a satisfactory record, he
may be assured of three years of
predoctoral study.

The University will begin its
recruitment immediately. The
traineeships begin this Septem-
ber.

In mid-December official Uni-
versity statements indicated that
the University will actively seek
to become “state-related,” with
lower tuitions and higher enroll-
ments being the immediate re-
sults. It was clear that the Unil
versity had not yet settled on a
speciﬁc plan for accomplishing
this.

Gwilym A. Price announced at
that time that University offi-
cials would soon begin discus-
sions with state government offi-
cials and legislative leaders on
plans to incorporate the Univer-
sity into the commonwealth sys-
tem on higher education. How-
ever, Price explained that no ef-

speciﬁc plan in legislation dur-
ing the present session of the
Pennsylvania General Assembly.
Dr. Crawford expects that it will
‘be ﬁve years before any deﬁnite
plan goes into operation, », _. ,
Two plans for “state'-related‘-
ness” are under consideration by
the Board:
, hr “The Cornell Plan”: Under
this plan the state would contract
with the University for certain
educational services. Cornell Uni-
versity currently operates . New
York state-ﬁnanced educational
programs in veterinary medicine,
home economics, industrial rela-
tions and agriculture. A similar
plan at the University presum-
ably would be directed at provid-
ing undergraduate education at
.low cost to a larger number of
state students.

5 “The Temple Plan”: This
plan is based on legislation pass-
ed during the present sessions of
the General Assembly for Tem-
ple University in Philadelphia. By
this plan one-third of Temple’s
trustees are state-appointed. In
return, the state partially sup-
ports certain graduate and pro-
fessional programs at the school,

‘Dr. Crawford Spells Out

Increased State Relation

oped by the Graduate School/hf

Library and Information Sci- .

ences, the library will be able to
serve larger numbers of students.

At the same time Dr. Craw-
ford foresaw many increased con-
struction as a result of the new
state relation. In addition to new
residential and dining facilities,
_the increase in size of the faculty

- will present a need for new class-

rooms and especially new faculty
offices. Dr. Crawford said that
this expansion in facilities will
always be a little behind the

growth, because of the length of _

time required for ﬁnancing build-
ings.  h ,

Dr. Crawford said that the pre-
sent ﬁnancial situation is improv-
ing steadly. “Since the common-
wealth, recognized the Universi-
’€y’s most acute ﬁnancial emer-
gency with the $5 million grant
and since other sources of in-
come are continuing at a reassur-
ing level, we have some hopes of
balancing the budget in the ﬁscal
year of 1965-1966.

Remarks by Dr. Stanton C.
C7*awfo7'd, Acting Chancellor, de-
livercci to the Centu/ry Club, Dec.
11,1965.

The University’s Trustees, in

close conconsultation with the ad-
ministration and faculty, have
decided to set the University on
a course toward closer state re-
lationships. While no -speciﬁc

plan for accomplishing this ob-

jective this objective has been
put forward, this decision is a
basic one which represents a
fundamental new direction and
impetus for the University.

Coming on the heels of the ﬁ-
nancial crisis of last summer and
the other turmoils of the Univer-
sity in recent months, there is a
real danger that this latest de-
velopment might be mis-read
that it may seem to some like
just- one more necessary but not
wholly welcome step in the rudi-
mentary survival of the institu-
tion.

What is it that we are attempt-
ing to do here? What practical
effect will this all have?

1. We are . . . about to take a.
good University, and make it a
better institution. We have no
intention of diminishing the
quality of this institution one bit.
In fact, every effort will be made
to improve it.

2. We are about to add to this

‘ institution a new dimension of

service to our region and our
state—the education of larger
numbers of undergraduates at

the lowest tuition rate which we I

may ﬁnd it possible to arrange.

3. We are about to create a uni-
que arrangement between a pri-
vate university and a state gov-
ernment for the support of high
er education. -

4. And ﬁnally, the key to the
success of this endeavor may lie,
not solely with the state and the
university, but with the all im-
portant private citizen and con-
tributor to higher education. This
is, in reality, a three-way part-
nership.

I cannot emphasize these four
points too much-. . .

As long ago as last May, for-
mer Chancellor Litchﬁeld told a
state legislative committee that
the University then was in the

processof re-thinking its role at A
the end of a decade of enormous .

progress, and outlining its plans
for the decade ahead.

He made a number of points
which bear repeating: He said
that higher educational needs of
the Commonwealth were not one,
but several . . . the Common-
wealth needed community col-
leges, four year liberal arts col-
leges, facilities for educating
large numbers of undergraduates
at low cost and institutions which
devoted their energies primarily
to graduate and professional edu-
cation and research, as Pitt was
then doing. He said, too, that the
University of Pittsburgh would
continue to need substantial Com-
monwealth aid . . . and that the
University is and would remain
committed primarily to the re-
gion of which it is a part.

In the intervening months, the
University has sought to more

clearly deﬁne its role and the
needs of its region. Over the past
decade, the main thrust at Pitt
has been to develop the institu-
tion into a broadly-based, re-
search-oriented university with a
heavy concentration in graduate
and professional study. Further,
we have attempted to develop
undergraduate educational facil-
ities of sufficient quality to sup-
ply talent for these programs.

“But," as the Board pointed
out in the statement of the other
day, “in using its resources to
improve quality and build grad-
uate and professional programs,
the University in effect gave up
a role which it once played in
this region and for which there
is a continuing and increasing
demand—name1y, an institution
which serves large numbers of
regional and state high school
graduates at relatively low cost.”

To re-incorporate this l.atter
function into the University’s
present role was the intent of the
Board in stating its pnesent posi-
tion concerning Commonwealth
relationships.

Pitt would still be a private
University . . . a private Univer-
sity in every sense of the word

. a private University in the
management of whose affairs and
in whose support the state is but
one participant. In no other state
but Pennsylvania would the crea-
tion of such a new type of Uni-
versity be possible.

I would assure you that these
current developments mean not
less reliance on the private sec-
tor for University support, but
more.

I am conﬁdent that you will
meet this chalenge. Thank you.

 dents are hoping to institute a
systemlwhich reviews the effec-
ftiiieness of the curricula and“the
I faculty. It is interesting to imag-
Iine if .it had been in operation

’Professor Irwin Steech
‘nervously adjusted his tie as
he walked along the tenth
—ﬂoor corridor in Tower A
This would be the ﬁrst of
several students he would
have to see today and the
feeling that his stomach was
cwejghtless in outer space
made him slightly nauseous.
He had felt this way since
he had received his grade
sheet in yesterday’s mail; he
had gotten a “D” in cathar-
sis, his major.

_ As he walked the corridor
-in search of student Karl
Hein’s room he thought of
all the ways in which he
-might have avoided this un-
happy circumstance. Hein
‘had once said to him after
class, “Drop around and vis-
it with me some time
Steech, I’m always interest-
ed in ,the problems . of V my
professors.” _

But Professor Steech had
never accepted the invita-
tion. ‘And now, instead of a
sympathetic. ear to the prob-
lems with which he had been
working during the past tri-
mester, he feared he would
only ﬁnd scepticism and re-
jection.

. Progressive programming may be slowly making its Way iI1'C0 the
University community. The new Student Union Board (SUB) arrange-
ment is a long overdue ﬁrst step in stimulating such forward movement.
.- "C New committees break the shackles of narrowly-directed interest
qategories, giving areas of signiﬁcant programming in which board mem-
bers and students can participate.
C One eminent result of the new board set up is the Public Affairs
.» ieries. The ﬁrst speaker will be Theodore Sorensen, noted author and aide
f former President John Kennedy.
. lf Vance Packard, author of the. Status Seekers, will be the next lec-
‘-turer, and later in the trimester will be Dr. Mortimor Adler, prominent
7 scholar from the University of Chicago. ' ‘
‘So what? The what is that such high calibre speakers have 11013
fjbeen a dominant part of previous SUB programming. Prior to the new
arrangement, operating funds were split up among a multitude of com-
 sub-committees, and special committees. -

A Grade in the Hand  

reached the closed door of

the room he veriﬁed as’

Hein’s by lifting the photo
of the Playboy nude which
obscured the number, and
checking the number against
the list which’ his students
had given him at the begin-
ning of the trimester. He
checked his watch to see
that the office hours were in
his favor, and knocked.

At ﬁrst there was no an-
swer. .

“Maybe he’s out,” thought
the professor, and his heart
leapt, for he knew that stu-
dents rarely observed their
office hours.

But after he knocked
again, just before giving up

hope, the door swung open _

and» Karl Hein was sitting ' at
his desk. And worse still, his
roommate was in. There
would be ‘no privacy. ‘

“Ah, Steech!” said Hein.
“Come in, come in. How are
you getting along?”

Professor _Steech wrung
his ﬁngers a little in front
of his waist, then said softly
with a glance at Hein’s room-
mate, “I’ve come to see you
‘about my grade.”

“Well, have a seat,” said
Hein, flipping some dirty
clothes from a chair and

“pulling it next ,to his desk.

“You _know I don’t really
think there's much I can do
to help you.”

Steech nodded and looked
penitent as he sat down, still

Under the new plan, not only is there a consolidation of committee
work but a concentration of funds. There will be increasingly less 1111-
known speakers and more of the Sorenson-calibre.

The new concentration also indicates a trend in the Student Union’s
orientation towards becoming the center for all student activity. Such. an
arrangement would allow the SUB to concentrate on quality programming,
while other campus organizations used the Union as the locale for their

functions.

Another healthy sign of programming progress is the upcoming

appearance of the Serendipity Singers, Jan. 12 at Carnegie Music Hall.

kneading his hands slightly.

“I knew the material,”
said the professor, “but I al-
ways seem to freeze up just
before I deliver my lecture.
I've always been anxious
that way and I know it hurts
my performance.”

“What about the paper?”
asked Hein, solemnly.

“I’m sorry I didn’t get it
back to you on time, but I

had so much to do that week,

what with the new baby and
all, that I really didn’t have
a chance to grade it until
past the deadilne.”

Hein sat back in his chair
and looked at the ceiling, his
ﬁngertipsx. just barely .to-
gether in front of him. Fin-

"ally he signed, “You realize

you should have come to see
me sooner. We students

~ aren’t such bad guys and we

understand your problems if
given a chance.”
"Professor Steech smiled a
little at this ray of -hope.
“And I’ll have to admit
that you did come to class
every time,‘and you did give
some intelligent answers to
questions. That shows you,
were interested. Catharsis is
your major, isn’t it Steech ?”
The professor nodded, not
daring to believe what was
happening.
f‘All right, Steech,” .said
Hein, sitting forward, “I’ll
call the Office of Faculty
Records and change it to a
‘C’. And let this be -a lesson
to you in the future. Don't
be afraid to let the students

. know when you’re having

trouble.”
On his way out of the

[room Professor Steech al-

most knocked down someone
who had just turned into the
doorway. It was Assistant
Professor Lint of lntrinsics,
looking rather nervous.

Weekly Calendar

Receives Criticism
Editor, The Pitt News:

There is was again——that haunt- .

ing refrain. Every Monday edi-
tion of The Pitt News hums the
delicate melody. Today, however,
the haunting V melody achieved
symphonic proportions. _

The esoteric music I am refer-
ring to innocently abides within
the conﬁnes of The Pitt News’
jukebox—-namely, the “Weekly
Calendar.” It attained “symphon-
ic” (if not macabre) proportions
since Dec. 6. We were treated to
a “ﬁve week extended forecast”

of University activities. Yes, I am '

alluding to those laconic and mys-
terious announcements, .“Noon—
Mass. H ,” “3:30 p.m.—Confes-
sion. HC,” and “7 p.m.-—Jewish
Sabbath Service. HC” et al.

There were no less than 56 in- "

nocuous re1igious- announcements
-—a ﬁendishly persistent little re-
frain if ever I heard one and
certainly not one easily overlook-
ed. Yet, many times one would
be hard pressed to even ﬁnd .56
people attending one of these
functions at HC. (Oh, for those
of you who may still be unfami-
liar with the cryptic designation

' of “HC,” it is that quaint (and

to some) grotesque architecture
jutting to prominence in the Cath-
ederal of Learning’s back yard.)

As I said earlier, it is a haunt-
inglittle refrain sandwiched be-
tween such sober proclamations
as “Automation and Its Effects
by “Karmnareddy Chinnapared-
dy" and “Wrestling. Pitt at Tem-
ple.” ' .

Yes, we're in college now, fel-

low students! At last we can.

Credit Revision
Editor, The Pitt News:

In the Dec. 1 issue of The Pitt
News, the’ editorial stated that
the University policy regarding
the two QPA records should be
revealed to the students. We feel
that it is also in strong need of
revision.

Now, studentswho do well in
levels one and two of a language
are at an added disadvantage
when they realize (usually only
when they meet their major ad-
viser), that their QPA is lower
than that recorded on their ‘grade
sheet. What is the use of doing-
well if the student can receive a
C and still have "the same grad-
uation QPA? So people who ac-
tually do work hard are not re-
ceiving any reward for their ef-
forts.

It is also true that levels one
and two are adequate to put ,a
student on probation, but, at the
same time, are not_ adequate to
be included for graduation.

Finally, there is the money as-
pect. Levels one and two are
both four credit courses, while
levels three and four are only
three credits. Fourty-seven dol-
lars a credit for eight credits that
don’t even count is economical-
1y absured for us as students.

The possible solution to this

problem could be simply‘ to give '

the eight credits to those’ people

.who place above levels one and

two as well as those who earn
these credits. This would reward
the people who work for their
grades, be counted toward grad-
uation and for probation, and not
waste $376. This .solution would
not be a disadvantage to those_
who place above levels one and
two because their QPA would
only include those subjects for
which they receive grades.

  Engineers
Establish

Program

The University’s School of En-
gineering has established a new
doctoral program called “Systems
Management Engineering and Op-
erations Research.” It is being
offered by the Industrial Engi-
neering department in both a
full-time and an. evening pro-
gram.

The program is ‘designed to
train engineers to develop new
systems for industry, government
and service organizations, such
as hospitals and information cen-
ters. The program is based on
advanced mathematics and engi-
neering, but the engineer at-
tends classes with the potential
political scientist, sociologist, doc-,
tor or businessman to learn to
communicate in areas other than
"engineering. ,

Many companies today are us-
ing inﬂexible, stereotyped plan-
ning and control systems, ac-
cording to Dr. Albert G. Holzman,
chairman of the department of .
industrial engineering. The new
program will train engineers -to
develop systems tailored to the
demands of speciﬁc organizations.

“I envy my roomate’s clean, neat clothes.” Everyday he put’s
on a shirt that looks like new, slacks that have a sharp crease
and a sweater»that—-oh I can_go on and on. He said he takes
his clothes to Crandall’s. You know the place Doc, it’s right
under the dorms. They have experts there that do wonders
for your clothes; They even give a 20% Student Discount! «

Boy I feel much better since I talked about it. But why
do I just talk about it. I’m going /to go right down there
with my slacks and shirts and sweaters and jacket and ties-
everything. See yah next week. Doc—I’m' going to have a
problem with my girl. She’s just going to love .my neat
appearance and I just don’t think she’ll be able to adjust.

the newest Detroit sound

comes from a combo

called 4‘4-2

Up-tempo all the way. With a 400-cube V-8 and 4-barrel carb to carry
the lead. Heavy-duty front and rear suspension to smooth the beat.
Acoustically tuned twin pipes to modulate the sound. And red-line
tires to keep the whole score on track. That's 4-4-2. Try about four bars
