Festival Slated
F ch. 27 and 23

By —GORDON CLOWNEY

The preliminaries of the
eighth annual Poetry Read-
ing Festival, under the joint
sponsorship of the depart-
ments of ‘English and Speech,
will get under way next Wed-

nesday afternoon in the Pitt Stu-
dent Union.

Preliminary readings, which will

Carolyn LaRue, of the English
Department, will be held in the
first ﬂoor Schenley Room from

2:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. on both wed-t 

nesday and Thursday.
Wide Range of Sources
The Poetry Reading Festival is
the result of the combined interest
of faculty and students. It is to

{provide all students with an op-

portunity to recite poetry of their
choosing. Interested students may
select theri poetry from narrative,
the ballad, dramatic monologue,

-poetic drama, the lyric, the ode,

the sonnet, and modem or clas-
sical poetry.

In fact, this year some stu-
dents will recite original verse,
while others will ‘take their se-
lections from the works of local
authors. However, the empha-
sis this year will be on the
modern. Selections of which
will be taken from the works
of such poets as Carl Shapiro,
Robert Frost, E. E. Cummins,
Auden, and Spenser. 

Miss LaRue will preface the
day’s readings with a few intro-
ductory remarks about the import-
ance and place of the poetry fes-
tival. The following group of

SC Elects New Officers
To Fill Vacant Positions

By MILLARD AMDUR

In elections held at the

Student Congress meeting on

Monday, Feb. 18, in French Room of Student Union, Lowell
Tarbett, Eng. ’57, became vice-president, Betty Chiapetta,

Ed. ’58, corresponding secretary, and Virginia Van Goetham,

Col. ’57, faculty-relations chairman of the governing organi-
zation. All the elections were to ﬁll vacancies for the dura-

tion of the school year.

Assemblies c h air m a n, Stan
Goldberg, Col. ’59, announced to
Congress that two motion pictures
will be shown at assembly pro-
grams this semester. Song to‘ Re-
member and Snake Pit are de-
ﬁnitely booked for the early
spring. There is some possibility
of procuring two other widely ac-
claimed films.

Athletic Committee chairman,
Lowell Tarbett, reported that the
Student Section had been expand-
ed rather than minimized for the
West-Virginia basketball game.
The seats made available to stu-
dents were almost doubled, yet
the terriﬁc demand made it nec-
essary to turn some away. Home-
coming for the 1957 football sea-
son has been set for the Syracuse
game, November 2. To avoid the
complications of last year’s choice,
a central committee representing
all the interested groups, made the
selection. 1

The Spring Carnival Commit-
tee, under the chairmanship of
Bob McCabe, Col. ’57, stated the
impractibility of limiting total
expenses of Spring Carnival.
One man from this committee

A
T ‘

williserve on the planning com-
mittee for the_ annual carnival
week, in order to offer counsel
on this vital question.
SC voted to participate fully in
a chest x-ray project to be hand-
led later in the spring. Congress,
as well as Men’s Council, has been
invited to the annual WSGA Din-
ner and Meeting to follow. This
event will be on March 13 with
dinner ‘served at 5:30 p.m.

‘Congress also voted strongly
in favor of assisting the uni-
versity in the vast polio innoc-
ulation drive beginning next
week. Over 20,000 individuals
will receive the shots and the
university will receive nation-
wide television coverage and,
no doubt. articles in national
weeklies.

A motion to propose to the ad-
ministration the feasibility of a
university-wide free ﬁfth hour
was tabled until next week so
more testimony on the subject
could be gathered.

Dr. Peake, assistant chancellor
on student affairs, will address the
group next week.

Panetta, Assistant Professor of
Classics; Dr. Robert Griswold,
Professor of Music; and Dr. Jo-
seph Greco, Asistant Professor of
Modern Languages.

Judging will be based on how
effectively the material is com-
municated to the audience.

Miss LaRue has announced that
contrary to previous years, many
athletes have entered. Although
there were few varsity athletes
entering last year, the winner was
one of Pitt’s ﬁrst string football
players, Bob Rosborough, Col. ’57,
who will be back again this year
to defend his title.

HonorPlan Remains l

Undecided By Poll

_ By STUART SMITH

Last year, the Council of Scholastic Organizations along
with Student Congress Prexy, Bob Sedler, Col. ’56, drew
up a plan for a proposed undergraduate honor system. Be-
lieving at that time that an honor system would promote
the development of self-respect, responsibility, and esprit
de corps among the student body, they submitted the follow-

A
V

1. All students shall sign this
pledge at each registration with
the participating schools: “On my
honor, I will not cheat in any
school activities, and I accept my
responsibility to report any cheat-
ing I might witness to the Honor
Committee.

2. Proctoring of examinations
shall not benecessary. L

3. An Honor Committee
composed of the Dean of Men,
‘Dean of Women, the deans‘ of
‘participating schools, and one
appointed representative each
I from Student Congress, Council
of Scholastic Organizations,
WSGA, and Men’s Council shall
hear all cases arising under the
honor system. The committee
shall beheaded by the deans of
the participating schools, serv-
ing in rotation. Violators shall
be punished by expulsion from
the University or by less severe
action at the discretion of the
committee acting unanimously.

4. A student observing another
student cheating shall point out
the violation to a third student;
then the two witnesses shall ne-
quegt the violator to report his

‘own offense to the honor commit-

tee. If he refuses, the two wit-
nesses shall report the violation
to the committee.

After careful study, CSO decid-
ed that under the present system,
it would be unwise to put an hon-
or system into effect at this time,
due to the wide diversiﬁcation of
student subjects and interests. The
organization then voted to scrap
its own proposal.

This year, Omicron Delta
Kappa recognized the need for
an honor system and made a
similar proposal. ODK took it
to Dr. Charles H. Peake, vice-
chanceilor in charge of student
affairs for his opinion. Although
Dr. Peake thought that the pro-
posed honor system would be
good for the school and would
enhance its reputation, he cau-
tioned against the speedy en-
actment of such a system.

He said, “There are numerous
obstacles. To be a right thing, it
might take years, possibly two
student generations. In other
‘words, it must be an evolution and
not a revolution.” Dr. Peake added
that it would be best to start at
the graduate level, possibly the
Law School, where interests are
primarily the same.

Would an honor system be good

' or bad for Pitt? This question was

put to the following students:
Alice Katsafanas, Ed. ’57 —- I
think the honor system is a very

good thing. However, since most

of the classes are too large, I

don’t think it will work in this
university.

Eleanor Perry, Col. ’59-—I think
the honor system is too idealistic
to have it work in a school this
size. Enough pressure isn’t placed
on the student to eliminate the
temptation of cheating.

Donna Groves, Col. ’57 -- An
honor system is good in any school
and Pitt is no exception.

Jack Albert, Engr. ’5'7—An hon-
or system would be harmful for
Pitt. It would make students no
more honorable than they already
are and it wouldn’t be good to
make a student report his friend.

Ralph Wilson, Col. ’57—-An hon-
or system would work, not be-
cause of the integrity of the in-
dividual, but merely because of
the embarrassment of violating it
in front of other students in the
class.

Sut Hamilton, Col. ’5'l'--I don’t
think so. The honor system shifts
responsibility from the faculty to
the students. In large schools, like
Pitt, it’s difﬁcult to obtain the
complete co-operation of the stu-
dent body, which is necessary for
any honor system. —

Rochelle Weiss, Col. 59-If the
set-up for an honor system is on
a proper basis, it could have its
value. ~

What effect the H e a r t
Fund’s disafﬁliation with the
United Fund has on either
group was the topic of dis-
cussion on last Wednesday
night’s Men Debate television
program, “Meet the People.” E. J.
Hanley and Dr. Wendell B. Gor-
den, of the United Fund and Heart
Fund, respectively, appeared ‘as
co-guests on the panel.

, In the past, both groups have
contributed funds to research on
the heart. Mr. Hanley claims that
“there is no controversy on re-
search.” The controversy seems to
lie in the means of obtaining
funds. Although the UF conducts
a campaign which contributes
funds to groups such as heart and
cancer, the Heart Fundrnaintains
an independent campaign.

According to Hanley, the UF
wants to assume the responsibility
of attaining funds for the Heart
Fund, but refuses to aﬁiliate. Re-
gardless of whether the Heart,
Fund joins the UF or not, the lat-
ter will continue to raise and con-
tribute money to worthy heart
research groups.

When questioned by Sam Reich,

Sally Thompson, Col. ’58—Peo-
ple of college level are considered
mature and should not, in my
opinion, have to be watched.

Willis J. Haas, Jr., Col. ’58-—It’s
worth a try, but will require co-
operation of faculty as well_as the
student body for success.

Richard Bott, Engr. ’58-—A lim-
ited form could be beneﬁcial, and
such a form is already in use in
some engineering classes. How-
ever, I am against a system that

requires reporting of other stu-
dents. .

 

Col. ’57, as to whether the Heart
Fun-d’s reason for disafﬁliation re-
sulted from an “edict” handed
down by the national organization,
Dr. Gordon replied that the policy
was a "democratically-arrived-at-
decision.”

Even if the United Fund were
to guarantee the American Heart
Association as much as it could
independently collect in a nor-
mal collection, the AHA would

 
   

Heart And United Funds Dehated’

not unite with the UF, said Dr.
Garden. He further explained
that the Heart Fund is “more
than a fund raising organiza-
tion.”

Mr. Hanley admitted in a con-
versation afterthe program that
if the Heart Fund were to conduct
a successful campaign, it could
beneﬁt ﬁnancially by 200%, “for
heart research funds would be
coming from two sources.” v

Program Conducted

To Orientate Nurses

By ROSALIE GLAND
To integrate graduate nurse students into the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, School of Nursing conducted an all-day
orientation program on Thursday, Feb, 14. I
The program, a ﬁrst for the School of Nursing, was

' planned to provide essential information about the Univer-

sity to nursing students who are currently enrolled as

non—degree students as well asO

those who have already been ad-
mitted to the School of Nursing
or Graduate School.
Education Stressed

The orientation hadpa four-fold
purpose. It was planned to an-
swer many of the nurses’ ques-
tions concerning the University;
to offer them an opportunity to
become better informed about the
educational opportunities. It was

aimed also at making their ex-'

periences on campus more enjoy-
able and to help them to ﬁnd
their places in the school they
have chosen.

“The ’most important thing

, we can accomplish by this pro-

gram is to make the nurses feel
they are a part of the Univer-
sity," commented Miss Gladys
Bonine, associate professor of
pediartic nursing and chairman
of the committee.

“This will be done if they suc-
ceed in developing a closer rela-
tionship with areas of the Uni-
versity other than the School of
Nursing and participate in Uni-

versity activities.”

The orientation, which was held
in the School of Health Profes-
sions, was divided into morning

‘and afternoon sessions.

Nursing Trends

Presiding at the morning ses-
sion, Miss Bonine introduced the
main speaker for the morning‘, Dr.
Ruth P. Kuehn, Dean of the
School of Nursing, whose subject
was “Trends in Nursing Educa-
tion.”

Following Dr. Kuehn’s talk
was a symposium on graduate
nurse education at the Univer-
snty. Chairman of the sym-
posium was Miss Mary Edna
Williams, clinical coordinator,
School of Nursing. Participating
were a number of faculty and
administrative personnel from
the School of Nursing.

Included among the topics pre-
sented were information about
admission ,and graduation re-
quirements, the Graduate Nurse
Qualifying Examination, and the
Student Advisory Program.

The remainder of the symposium
consisted of information regarding
the undergraduate programs for
nurses, Public Health in under-
graduate ‘programs, physical fa-
cilities in the Medical Center, and
job opportunities.

point‘ that everyone must pay the
previous pledges and all those

After the morning session the

nurses divided into groups, each
with a member of the faculty or
administration who served as
their hostesses and guides for
lunch. Visits were made to campus
spots ,of interest, such as the Heinz
Chapel and Stephen Foster Me-
morial. ‘ .

In the afternoon session they
heard a speech by Mr. Carroll
Reynolds, associate director of
the University Extension who
informed the nurses about the
activities of the AE & S and
Non-degree students. Dr. Don-
ald Swartz, director of Student
Publications, spoke on the extra
activities of‘ the University.

A question and answer period
concluded the orientation pro-
gram. According to the comments
made by many of the nurses who
attended the program, it had ful-
ﬁlled its four purposes.

  The Factory

 

Dynamic Students’ . 

By Barbara Cherington

Here sits the perplexed student. He is told
that he attends a factory, not a university. And
the more he reads examples which attempt to
prove that he attends a factory, the more he be-
lieves them. He believes because the examples
apply to himslf. ,

\‘ Yes, the student reﬂects, I d5 attend lectures
with 200 or more other students. ””  " """ " ‘ 
The professor does start with
the bell and leave at the end of
forty minutes. Some teachers do
seem like unreachable voices at
the opposite end of a lecture hall.
And my personality does seem
to mean no more than what is
stamped out on IBM cards.

All these pictures the student
remembers, and he is led to ac-
cept the factory theory. What he accepts for cure

    

of such a system is a more personalized education -A

such as a small campus school provides. He pre-
scribes‘ changes in faculty and administration plan-
ning and attitudes.

Student Criticizes

More closely supervised work, he suggests. Less
tape-recording type lecture, he says. Yes, he agrees,
the people operating the factory need to make
innovations. ‘

But here still sits the perplexed student. He

. has been convinced that he attends a factory. He

has prescribed innovations on the part of the ad-
ministration. He has criticized.. But he still at-

tends impersonalized lectures with 200 other stu-
dents. \

This minute, today, this semester, the only
person or persons the student controls is himself.
If he believes that he attends a factory system,
and if he wants to attend a university, he must
make the innovations himself. How? ‘

Opportunities are numerous. Professors allow
discussion time. (Six or seven students out of 35
usually take part at present.) Various organiza-
tions sponsor student-faculty panel discussions.
(A meager number of students usually attend).
Last Opportunities

The chance to understand people of foreign
countries is possible through conversation with the
many foreign students who take classes at the
University. (How many American students take
time to converse with foreign students whom

’they’ve known only through classes?)

Many new friends are possible out of the 200
impersonal‘ lecture class. (How often does any-
one leave their high school or other clique to
know new acquaintances?)

These and many other opportunities exist. Still
the student feels he is abandoned in a sea of un-
directed knowledge. .

He takes part in no discussion, he is lax in writ-
ing reports, he attends no arranged activities, and
he remains within an early-formed circle of friends.
And so he resigns himself to one person’s opinion
of his fate for four years. ‘

All this negationﬂbecause he believes" what is
strengthened by his own blind belief: he attends
a factory.

A is the duty of
every individ-
ual in that or-

to consider matters of concern to
women as a whole, and to be the
coordinating agency among or-
ganized activities for Women
students” has chosen to be gov-
erned by, Robert’s Rules of Or-

WSGA Commission made a de-

these Rules of Order.
According to the decision
reached on these resolutions, the

ceremony of coronation and the

selection of a Senior Queen or
any comparable recognition of
individual «senior women by the
Women’s Self Government As-
sociation is to be discontinued.
These decisions, however, were
reached by a vote taken in a
meeting where there was got a
quorum present.

Under the Robert’s Rules of
Order, “theonly business that
can be transacted in the absence
of a quorum is to take measures
to obtain a quorum, to fix the
time to which to adjourn, and to
adjourn, or to take a recess. Un-

Polio Questions

By Ed Bachman
Allegheny County’s war on
polio will get probably its big-
gest single boost next week when
the University of Pittsburgh
stages its massive free inocula-
tion clinic. An event of this size
no doubt brings many questions
to mind, and this column will
attempt to answer some of the
more prominent of them. Infor-
mation to any questions unan-
swered here’ may be obtained in
the polio information booth in
the Commons Room or by calling
‘ extensions 300, 301, 302 or.3l1.
Q.--What if I miss registering
during those times?
A.-—The special booth in the
.. Commons Room will be used for
that purpose.
should be signed by your parent
or guardian if you are under age.
Q.—What procedure should I
follow on the day of the shots?
A.-You should enter the Com-
mons Room from the Fifth Ave.
entrance. There, a marshal will
direct you to one of three lines.
There will be little waiting in
line, as each team will be pre-
pared to handle from 200 to 300
persons per hour. Your card will

be checked, your arm will be
swabbed, a physician will give
you the shot, and you will re-
ceive a card for your second po-
lio shot—al1 in a short period
of time.

Q.-—-Will the shot hurt, or have
any after-effects?

A.—Because the vaccine itself
is non-irritating, the injection for
polio"vaccine is almost painless.
The shot hurts no more than a
pin prick and takes only a few
seconds. There are no unpleas-
ant after-effects from an injec-
tion—-not even soreness of the
arm. The best proof of this is the
fact that children experience no
discomfort whatsoever.

Q.--How effective is the polio
vaccine?

A.--The National Foundation
for Infantile Paralysis states that
not a single case of paralytic
polio has been reported in any
individual protected by all three
recommended shots of Salk vac-
cine. If everyone under 20 years
of age were inoculated, 75% of
all potential polio would be elim-
inated; if all under 30 were given
the shots, 90% would be wiped
out; and if all under 50 were

‘a

would constitute at least 36 wo-
men. And yet, when the vote on
the above resolutions was reach-

ed, there were but 18 members '

of the Commission present -
only half the number required to
make up a quorum.

The fact is recognized that the
Commission has left the decision
open for contention; however, it
seems that under the circum-
stances, it should not even be
necessary that a member request
be reopened. In view of the
facts, it is apparent that the de-
cision reached was not necessar-
ily the opinion of the majority.
This decision, therefore, should
be allowed to stand only as a
poll of opinion —- not as an
official vote.

The fault concerning the pro-
ceedings of this vote lies not
only with the members present;

it is even more so the fault of V

these members not present. It
should be considered the duty of
each member of Commission to
see that the question is indeed

brought up for ,revotel—- when a ’

quorum is present, for it is only

 by following the technicalities of

proper parliamentary procedure
that one can determine the op-
inion of the majority.

given all three shots, virtually an
polio, or 98% to be exact, would
be eliminated.

Q.-How about persons who’ve
had polio?

A.--There are three types of
polio virus, and a person who
has recovered from an infection
of one type is not necessarily
immune to thepother two. Per-
sons who have had polio deﬁn-
itely should be vaccinated.

Q.-—H‘ow soon does the vac-
cine work? \
A.-—The first shot begins to

take effect seven to ten days

after it is given. The second shot
brings a sharper rise in anti-
bodies. With two shots, a person
should have protection against
paralytic polio for at least one
polio season.

Q.—When will I get the second
and third shot?

A.-—The second shots will be
given from March 27 through 30.
The third shots will be given in
October to all those who are still
connected with the University.
Graduating seniors will be ex-
pected to get the third shot
through their own physician.

Cagers

By ED KOLTISKA
Althought basketball experts predict that home teams

are nine to ten points better

Timmons will be out to disprove this philosophy‘ as his

than the visitors, Coach Bob

Panthers stroll over to the Skibo gym tonight for their
tilt with the Carnegie Tech Tartans. ,
In the series to date the Oaklanders hold a 78-17 ad-

vantage over Tech. Last season

Jungle Cats just barely
squeezed by the Tartans on two
occasions. The Panthers topped
Tech 78-76 at home, and had to

go into two overtime periods at‘

the Skibo gym before notching an
85-81 victory.

This year the Panthers showed
little mercy as they ran up one
of their highest scores of the sea-
son in downing the Tartans, 89-56.

Trouble Expected
Coach Timmons expects some

trouble from the Tartans tonight
. due to the small size of the Skibo

court. Timmons notes, “These
Tech boys are very tough on a
small court. They seem to double

their shooting percentage on their

home court compared to their trip
averages.” ‘
The Jungle ICats, after two
days rest, will take to the road
again as -they travel to West

7 Virginia to meet the Mountain-

‘eers and Hot Rod Hundley.

Although the Mountaineers
have been a jinx to the locals at
the Field House, the Panthers
have been able to reverse this
situation by downing the Ridge-
runners at Morgantown.

Hundley Stops Antics

With the Mountaineers recent
loss to Penn State, Coach Fred

Schauswill be more than happy if_

his squad can make ammends by
putting the damper on the NIT

and NCAA seeking Panthers.

F rosh Cagers  
Battle Tartans

This evening, prior to the
regularly scheduled varsity
contest between Pitt and Car-
negie Tech, the freshman
squads of the two schools will
meet in a preliminary tilt.
The contest begins at 7 p.m. in
the Skibo gymnasium.

Having already easily defeated
the Tartan Frosh at home, Coach
Carl Peterson's Panther Cubs
should not have a great deal of
difficulty in performing the task
once again.

The only apparent stumbling
block in the path of victory for
the Blue and Gold is the un-
happy task of playing in the
ever dangerous Skibo gym where
upsets are rather frequent.

Doing most of the playing for

the Panther frosh will be the sev-
\ en men whose names begin with

“M”—Gene- Masseri, John Man-
dish, John Malley, Tom Maloney,

John Mills, Elliot Maravich, and

Bill Mauro. Also ready to see
action are Bob Gutendorf and
George Zanicopoulos.

Leading the way for the Car-
negie Tech frosh are Stan Skalka,
Boyd vDoxtader, and Frank Do-
brian. Skalka is a big, tall pivot
man who gave the Panther Cubs
plenty of trouble in the initial
encounter between the two teams
while scoring 18 points.

Doxtader also proved difficult
as he successfully bottledup Gene
Masseri. Dobrian, who also sees
action with the varsity, has been
scoring well for the Plaid.

FENCING CLUB

The Pitt Fencing Club will
meet Thursday from 5-7 p.m.
in the Cathedral gym. All in-
terested students are asked to
attend. No experience is nec-
essary. The new class will start
Feb. 21. ' r

The Panthers will again stack
up their regulars against the
Ridgerunners led by Hundley.
In their last meeting Hundley
put away his clowning to lead
his team to an 89-86 victory
over the Oaklanders.

In this tilt, Hundley received a
lot of scoring competition from
the locals’ Don Hennon. Both led
their respective teams in the
scoring department’ as Hundley
scored 32 points while Hennon
picked up 29.

Hot Rod Joins Elite
Hundley recently became the
ﬁfth man in collegiate history to
record over 2000 points in three
seasons of competition.
So far this season the Panther
‘scoring has been distributed
among the ﬁrst ﬁve _men. Hen-

First of all, what's it all about? What
does a fellow like John Jackson do
all day? In his _own words, “I keep

different companies--advising them
on the use of their IBM electronic
data processing computers. I person-
ally consult with these customers,
and analyze their scientiﬁc and tech-
nical problems for solution by IBM.
Occasionally, I'm asked towrite
papers, and give talks and demon-
strations on electronic computing.
All in all, it's pretty fascinating . . .
something new pops up every day."
In other words, John is a full-ﬂedged
computing expert, a consultant . . .

Since the IBM laboratories are
always devising easier and faster ways
to solve the problems of science, gov-

Science Representative can never say
he's learned his job and that's the
end of it. At least once eveiy two
months, he attends seminars‘ to be
updated on the latest developments in
engineering and operations research.

\ Introduces new methods

During the two years that John
has spent with IBM in Applied Sci-.
ence, he has guided innumerable IBM
customers to new and better ways of
doing things electronically. For ex-
ample: about a year ago, a leading
aircraft manufacturer wanted to ex-
periment with a radically different
design for a nuclear reactor. Although
the basic format had been established,
the project still required many months
of tail with mathematical equations.

Another service that John performs
is the constant reappraisal of each
customer's IBM operation. Occasion-
ally, a customer may tie himself in
knots over a procedural “stickler."
Periodically, in fact, John brings
IBM customers together . . . just to
talk over what's happening in each
other’s business——how everybody else
handled that old bugaboo in any
industry . . . details. l

 

The aircraft people decided that they
couldn’t'afford to wait that long, so
they called in IBM. After discussion
with top executives, John helped to

for wing stress analysis. At the same
time, he worked with this company's.
own employees, training them in the

drops around to see that everything
is running smoothly.

New field for Mathematicians

John is exercising his mathematical
know-how in a ﬁeld that was prac- V
tically unheard of ten years ago. Even
now, this kind of work may be news
to you. It was to John Jackson a few
years back when he was an under-
graduate at the University of Colo-

search. But John liked the excitement
and diversiﬁcation of science and in-

Grady Sees Middies  

Trouncing Tankers

As the swimming season nears its close, the only thing
the Panther mermen can do is hope for a complete reversal
in fortune that will come in time for the Eastern champion-

ship meet, which is scheduled

for the Lehigh University pool,

March 7 and 8.

,But according to Coach Ben
Grady, who is by no means a
“crier,” this much-needed reversal
is entirely out of the picture. “We
don’t have enough now,” Grady
says. “We’re shot!”

.Getting down to speciﬁcs, he
offers, “I think Lehigh is a little
too strong for us. And don’t for-
get that Rutgers, who is also a
member of the Eastern Collegiate
Swimming Association, has al-
ready beaten us.” The Panthers
dropped their second lidlifter to
Rutgers, 44-42.

Marks Returns

Not wishing to be completely
pessimistic about the situation,
Grady adds, “We’ll be in there
plugging, but'I don’t know where
we’ll ﬁnish.”

This past‘ week the locals’
chances were enhanced when
diver Burt Marks returned to
the squad after a semester ab-
sence. With only a few days of
practice, Marks placed third in
diving against Syracuse last
Saturday night, and Grady feels
that as soon as Marks gets in
shape he will be a help to the
team. ‘

After the loss to the Orange-
men, Grady became a bit unreal-
istic when he thought of what sort
of team he might have had “if.”
If Tony Tresser hadn’t gone to

this unusual participation will

hadn’t decided to continue his
education in Italy, etc. Grady ex-
pressed his feelings rather des-
pondently, but once again realist-
ically, in saying, “We had a good
team last June.”

Navy Tough

Saturday -the Panther natators I

will face much the same prospects
as they have faced all season when
they takeitheir 1-6 record to An-
napolis. “Navy,” in the local
coach's estimation, “has a power-
house. They will dominate the
meet and take most of the ﬁrst
places.” I

Even Warne White, the Pan- A

thers’ outstanding freestyler and
point-getter, will‘ have a, rough
time against the Navy’s “ﬁsh,” Cal
Martin and T i m C a r e s. While
White has been on and off so far
this season, mostly on, he prob-

ably will have to swim his best‘

races of the seven meets if he
hopes to gather some important
points for the Panthers.

One Decisioned, Two TKO’d

Boxers Drop GG Finals

, By MURRAY CI-IASS
The unwritten rule that the home players have the ad-
vantage did not pay off last night at the Pitt Field House
as all three finalists who are Pitt students lost in the ﬁnals

of the Golden Gloves

A

Jack Sloanflight heavyweight,
was TKO’d in the second round;
Ronnie Wyatt, welterweight, lost
via a decision; and Ed Bolner lost
by a TKO in the ﬁrst. All three
Panthers fought in the Senior
Novice Division. This means that
they are at least 18 years of age
and have had no previous ex-
perience in the ring.

The biggest crowd in Field

House history, 6104 “blood
thirsty iscreamig fans, saw the

three Panther pugilists go down
to their ﬁrst defeats.

Sloan, who was a guard on the
local freshman football squad and
who ﬁghts out of the West Penn
Recreation Center, was beaten by
Cephus Huff of the Kay Boys’
Club.

From the middle of the ﬁrst
round until the :58 mark of the
second when the ﬁght was stopped,
Huff battered away at Sloan’s face

twith left jabs and had his nose

bleeding profusely--— so much in
fact that Sloan’s seconds were un-
able to stop the ﬂow between

rounds.

Then with less than a minute
gone in the second‘, the referee,
with the crowd in agreement,
ended the battle. '

Bolner, a Belleﬁeld A. C. prod-
uct, lost to one of the most ag-
gressive ﬁghters in the tourna-
ment, Dave ‘Rich of New Castle.

Rich darted out of his corner
at the ﬁrst bell and never stopped
swinging. Bolner hit the canvas
twice—the ﬁrst time he bounded
right back up; but as he got up
the second time at the 41-second
mark, his trainer Al Quaill told
referee Ernie‘ Sesto to stop the
battle. I

The red-headed Wyatt lasted the

longest of the trio, losing a un‘ani- A

mous decision to Richard Johnson
of the Gateway A. C. Johnson had
Wyatt in mild trouble in the ﬁrst,
but the Belleﬁeld A. C. boxer re-
covered and hung on.

Although Johnson proved the
better boy, both ﬁghters were tired
in both the second and third
rounds. 7

FREE! INVISIBLE SHIRT-S!‘

It is a little known fact that
Van Heusen, in addition to
its regular merchandise, also f
makes 9. grand line of invisible
shirts. Alas, they have never
proved very popular. People
lose them easily. Laundries are
confused by them.‘ And people
wearing these invisible shirts
are not just walked over, they're
sometimes walked through.
So, we’re stuck with thou-
sands of them} and we’ve just
decided to give them away. To
you! Just write Van Heusen.
We will send you free a com-
plete wardrobe of invisible
shirts. Not just one or two!
Not us. We'll send you hun-

dreds of them. In every style!‘
Every size! Every collar fash-
ion! All handsome. All invis-
ible. Probably the ﬁnest you've
never seen.

As for visible shirts -and
shorts, sport shirts, sweaters,
pajamas, handkerchiefs and ties
——well, you know Van Heusen.
We have most of the new styles
before anybody else. And we
handle traditional favorites in
a way that explains why cer-
tain styles last a long, long
time. Your local haberdasher
carries ..a large Van Heusen
selection. See him soon.’
