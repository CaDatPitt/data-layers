UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Shepard, 1990 SGB
members sworn in

By Jenifer Crook
Asst. News Editor

Pledging to “be realistic in
setting goals” for the coming year,
newly sworn-in Student
Government Board PresidentJulie
Shepard officially began her
tenure last night.

“My hopes are that we deal
mainly with real issues this year,
that we don’t try to solve the
problems of the world because
that canlt be done,” Shepard said
in her address to the 1990 SGB
during the inauguration ceremony
held in the William Pitt Union.

In her speech, Shepard also
stressed the need for cooperation
between SGB members.

"There were a lot of individual
projects in the past year, and
individual ideas are good, but we
do need to work together more.”

Addressing a major component
of her election platform, board
accessibility, the senior
communications major said, “We
can’t shut ourselves up in our
offices. We need to wonder, not
wander, around the university --
looking for what things we can
do and improve.”

The first goal the new board
will attend to, Shepard said, is
setting the priorities for the
coming year.

“As for projects, we have some
good ideas. We need to put those
on a time line and then go
backwards to see how long each
one will take. And the projects
that don’twork out we have to do
something about. We can’t just
let them hang.”

In his farewell address,
outgoing board President Kent
Baldauf praised Shepard’s work
as a 1989 board member, adding
that he is confident she will
continue her dedication as
president.

He also cited each outgoing
board member singly for the effort
he or she made throughout the
year. Three board members, Justin
Lawhead, Anastasia Kawalec and
Elissa Klein, received special
recognition.

“I don’t think Justin will ever
lose his drive. It’s too bad he
won't be serving on the board
another term,” said Baldauf,
pointing out Lawhead’s strong
dedication to every project he
oversaw, including the creation a
legal seminar for students living
off campus and his plan for an
expansion of the Trees Hall
weight room. Although the
expansion has not yet gained full
approval, Shepard has pledged
that this year’s board will see
Lawhead’s project through to

completion.

Naming it the “biggest
accomplishment of the 1989
board,” Baldauf said the newly
installed choice—dollars meal plan
option that Kawalec and Klein
promoted “has really made things
a lot easier for students. It’s a
program that will benefit students
for generations to come.”

Personally, Baldauf cited his
work with board member C.
Harper Watters regarding
problems with foreign teaching
assistants as his most successful
project as president. He called

the project “something that didn’t
happen yet but will come about
in the near future. I think there
will be stricter testing for foreign
TAs and more remedial training.
I just wish I could be around to
help see it through.”

Overall, Baldauf rated his tenure
as a successful one. “We had our
ups and downs just as every
board does. But we were very
productive,” he said.

Presenting the »welcoming
speech, Dr. Dennis Donham,
interim vice president for student
affairs, saluted the past year’s

Safety precautions in Pitt science labs questioned

By Jim Tezak
News Editor

Bill Sands sat dejectedly on the steps
across the street from Chevron Science
Center while approximately 400 students
and professors milled about the street
around him.

“I gassed the building,” said Sands, a
graduate student who teaches a physical
chemistry lab.

The incident occurred Oct. 19 when a
cylinder of hydrogen chloride gas was
accidentally discharged while Sands and
an undergraduate student were setting up
for a lab. The highly toxic gas forced
chemistry officials to evacuate the entire
building.

A campus police officer was taken to
Presbyterian—University Hospital due to
nausea caused by exposure to the fumes.
He was treated and released. Several
students who complained of eye irritation
were also taken to Presby.

The incident was one of several chemical
accidents that prompted an anonymous
letter to the U.S. Labor Department’s
Occupational Safety and Health
Administration office, alleging that certain
safety regulations were being ignored in
Pitt's science labs.

On Oct. 16, 1988, a chemical fire broke
out on the 11th ﬂoor of the chemistry
building near some highly explosive

oxygen and acetylene cylinders. No ﬁre
alarm went off to warn of the danger.

A letter to TbePittNews alleged that two
mercury spills occurred on Oct. 5 and Oct.
12, 1989. One of the spills caused a lab to
be evacuated for three days. A Langley
Hall lab had to be evacuated on Oct. 19
when a vial containing a toxic chemical
was accidentally dropped in a sink.

As recently as Dec. 5, an oven containing
benzoyl peroxide, a highly toxic and
ﬂammable chemical, exploded in a Scaife
Hall lab.

“Somebody ﬁled a non—formal complaint A

with us alleging various violations in the
lab,” said T om Tully, acting area director
for OSHA.

According to Tully, the allegations in

the letter, signed “a very concerned"

person,” included improper storage of
ﬂammable materials, environmentally
hazardous organic solvents being dumped
down drains and improper cleanup of
mercury spills.

Tully said that OSHA then sent a letter
to the university informing them of the
alleged violations. The university has sent
a response that was reviewed by OSHA’s
industrial hygiene manager, Edward Selker.

Selker said that the letter “appeared to
be a satisfactory response. Certainly they
were made aware of the problem.”

“If we would suspect that the university
letter is incorrect, we could go do a hands-

on inspection,” Tully said.

Normally, labs at Pitt are out of OSHA’s
jurisdiction, according to Tully. OSHA has
the job of inspecting labs in industry and
manufacturing, but cannot make legal
inspections of educational institutions
without a good reason.

“As far as the students are concerned,
our jurisdiction doesn’t cover them. There
has to be an employer—employee
relationship,” Tully said.

_ Tully and Selker said that there may not
even be any outside organization which
conducts regular safety inspections of Pitt's
labs.

“I wouldn’t know of any,” Selker said.
“Maybe the building's insurance carriers."

John Wicks, the chemistry building's
operations manager and the representative
from the chemistry department on the
University Safety Committee, said that the
University Safety Office is responsible for
inspecting the labs. He said that the
insurance carriers also conduct periodic
inspections, but did not know who actually
insures the chemistry building.

Greg Meisner, the instrumentation
manager for the chemistry department,
had no comment on the letter from OSHA.

“As far as their allegations are concerned,
I feel that we have to respond only to
them,” said Meisner.

However, Wicks confirmed that the
allegations were true and that the chemistry

department was in the process of correcting
the violations. ‘

According to Wicks, drains in the building
were inspected by Mike Glumac, the acting
safety inspector in the university’s physical
plant, and no mercury was found.

Glumac said that it is difficult to make
regular safety inspections of labs.

“It’s hard to inspect a lab because [there

are], experiments going on all the time,"

Glumac said.

Glumac also voiced skepticism about
the alleged mercury spills in the anonymous
letter that was sent to OSHA.

“It was a planned activity. Whoever
wrote the letter to OSHA put the mercury
on the floor themselves,” he said. “My
opinion is that it was done on purpose; it
was not an accident.”

Wicks said that the chemistry department
provides students with easy ways to dispose
of organic waste materials, instead of just
dumpingthem down the drain.

“You can’t monitor every single student
or every single researcher in the building.
If we make it easy for someone to dispose
of chemicals safely, there’s no excuse for
not doing it,” Wicks said.

He added, “One of the things poured
down the drain, especially in organic labs,
was acetone. As far as I know, it's quite
legal to pour acetone down the drain.”

Acetone is used in organic labs to clean

Safety

Continued from page 1
glassware; however, its use is
being discontinued due to the «
problem of storing the highly
ﬂammable liquid.

“Because this is the most widely
used solvent, cutting out the use
of acetone will bring us down to
an acceptable level,” Wicks said.
He said that soap and water would
be used in place of acetone.

According to Wicks, officials in

«~ the chemistry department have

also looked into installing safety
cabinets in the labs to store
ﬂammables. Each cabinet would
cost $750, and four would
probably be needed, he said.

“We have no qualms about
operating legally. It’s absolutely
foolhardy to try to operate a
program at a major research
university illegally. Eventually,
those things catch up to you,"
Wicks said.

Glumac said, “We get these
things and we respond to OSHA
and tell them what’s being done
about it. Then we go about our
business. OSHA can ﬁne you
$25,000 a day. OSHA doesn’t
play games.” ’

There are some students and
workers, however, who say that
Pitt’s science labs are unsafe and
that the administration doesn’t
care.

“It’s terrible,” chemistry
graduate student Eve Sullenberger
said of lab conditions. “Not as
much in undergraduate labs as in
the graduate labs upstairs. It’s
pitiful. {In} some labs the advisers
keep to safety regulations. {In}
others, they just don’t care.”

According to Sullenberger, the
Oct 5 mercury spill hasn’t been
cleaned up yet because the spill
occurred under an expensive
instrument. Mercury vapors are
highly carcinogenic.

“They don’t want to risk moving
the instrument to clean up the
mercury,” she said.

“The impression I get from A

people here when there is a
chemical spill is ‘the least number
of people who know about it, the
better.’ The general impression
from the people higher up is that
the less the university knows
about what goes on here, the
better," said “Joe,” an employee
in the chemistry building who
asked to remain anonymous for
fear of losing his job.

The violations Sullenberger
claims to have seen include bottles
of ﬂammable liquids sitting out
on the ﬂoor, organic chemicals
being distilled outside of fume
hoods that are used to protect lab
workers from dangerous vapors,
hoods that don’t work, hazardous
organic solvents being dumped
down drains, explosive gas
cylinders not tied down properly,
the valves on these cylinders not
being checked regularly and
instructors conducting unsafe
demonstrations in class.

“I don’t think the building is
very safe, but I think it’s mostly
because of the attitude of the
people in charge,” Joe said.

He said that one of the
building’s main problems, the
storage of ﬂammable materials,
could be easily and inexpensively
solved by installing the storage

cabinets that Wicks talked about.
He doesn’t believe that will
actually happen.

“It’s not so much breaking the
rules," Joe said. “It’s that they
don’t provide the facilities.”

“I think we make a pretty
conscientious effort to keep our
labs in as good of operating
conditions as possible,” Wicks
said. “We consider safety to be an
integral part of a chemistry
education.

“In the 28 years I’ve been here,
we’ve had relatively few accidents
compared to the number of
students who go through here.
Usually when we have an
accident, it is the result of
carelessness on the part of the
student, but not always."

Wicks added that all

undergraduate programs are

reviewed periodically, and any
considered unsafe are altered or
discontinued.

As an example, Wicks cited an
experiment that used to be done
in general chemistry in which

students had to bend glass tubing
to make a water bottle. Several
students were burned from the
glass, so the experiment is no
longer conducted. 0

“It’s [demonstrably] true that
the labs are safe,” said Meisner.
He pointed to an incident three
or four years ago in which a
student was involved in a minor
explosion.

According to Meisner, safety
precautions kept the student from
being seriously injured.

Referring to the Oct. 19 gas
leak, Meisnersaid that the campus
police officer present would not
have been injured if he had
listened to chemistry officials.

“Everyone told him that the
area was clear, but he had to go
and check it out for himself,”
Meisner said.

Sullenberger also stated that
the chemical environment in the
building is not healthy for anyone
who spends a considerable
amount of time there.

“We've been having a rash of

chemical bronchitis. The solvent
levels in the building are so high
that it’s beginning to affect
people's breathing passages,”
Sullenberger said.

Wicks, however, denied that
the environment in the chemistry
building actually causes
respiratory problems. He stated
that he has a 22-year-old nephew
and a granddaughter who both
have bronchial conditions and
neither one has anything to do
with chemistry.

“I’ve had bronchitis for about
three weeks to a month. There’s
a certain ambiance in the
chemistry building that could
aggravate somebody who has a
bronchial or asthmatic condition,
but unless you would have a
health team come in and do a
study, it would be hard to pinpoint
what is caused by the chemical
environment and what is just
going around,” Wicks said.

Officials at Presbyterian-
University Hospital said that since
most people with bronchitis are

treated as outpatients, it would
be nearly impossible to tell how
many workers from the chemistry
building have had the illness.
Wicks said that, although he
feels the labs are safe, students
must still be aware of the potential
hazards of some chemicals.
“There’s always an inherent
danger in using chemicals,” he

i said. “It’s just like using water or

electricity; you have to respect
what you’re working with.”

Both Sullenberger and Joe said
that the administration ignores
the safety of students and workers
in the chemistry building.

Joe said, “The whole attitude of
the administration is, ‘they’re only
students and they’re not going to
be in the building long.’ But what
about the people who work in
this building 12 hours a day?”

Meisner said, “Nothing is
perfect. The only thing that is
perfectly safe is to sit in your front
yard and play with a stick. Even
then, you can poke yourself in
the eye with the stick.”

Volunteer recognized

By Maria Perez
Staff Writer

A volunteer of the University
of Pittsburgh's Generations
Together program received
national recognition last month
for her work with the elderly.

The American Health Care
Association named the Allegheny
County student, Doan Nguyen,
Teen Volunteer of the Year in a
ceremony at Shadyside Nursing
and Rehabilitation Center on Dec.
28.

Nguyen has been a volunteer
at the center since she joined
Generations Together in 1985.
There she “adopted” a resident
of the center named Agnes, whom
Nguyen describes as “awesome.
She is very keen and has an open
mind."

Nguyen also created a crafts
program at the center about two
years ago. Every Friday, ﬁve of
her friends and 10 residents meet
to make arts and crafts.

When Nguyen won the Teen
Volunteer of the Year Award
from the Pennsylvania Health
Care Association in September,
she became eligible for the
national award. Fifty other
volunteers won similar state

Smokers needed for Pitt study

By Toni Crary
Staff Writer

Casual and regular smokers are
being given the chance to
participate in a computer study
of addicts and non—dependent
smokers to be conducted by Pitt’s
smoking research group.

The study, funded by the
National Institute for Drug Abuse,
will concentrate on “chippers,”
who smoke infrequently and at
low levels, and the reasons that
these smokers are not affected by
the addictive drug nicotine.

“Chippers know that they’re
different than most smokers, and
they’re curious about that,” said
Saul Shiffman, Pitt associate
professor of psychology and
smoking research group director.

“They want to gain an
understanding of their own
behavior. Most people who are
hooked on smoking are usually
puzzled or infuriated about the
fact that they have the habit.
They want to know why other
people are not dependent,” said
Shiffman.

Pitt freshman Kim Reuben

agreed. “I’ve been smoking on
and off for about two years, and
my smoking friends don’t
understand how I can only smoke
a few cigarettes a day,” she said.

According to Shiffman, the
study will document the effects
of not smoking using hand-held
computers about the size of a
calculator. The battery operated
computer will “beep” the
participant several times a day to
ask questions ranging from basic
arithmetic problems to inquiries
about the person’s mood and
physical state. Response time for
certain tasks such as repeatedly
hitting a computer key will also
be measured.

“The tests are not designed to
measure intelligence,” Shiffman
said. “They are not difﬁcult. The
demanding part is having to
schedule them into a normal day. ”

Subjects are contacted by the
computer ﬁve times a day on two
consecutive days for about five
minutes at a time. They are then
contacted again on the same two
days the following week.

Those participating will earn
$75 or more and will be

extensively trained to use the
computer before they begin the
study. “The computer training
will take most of the time, about
five or six hours. The rest of the
study will only take about 25
minutes at different intervals
during the day,” said Shiffman.
Participants will be needed
throughout this semester.
Shiffman stressed that he needs

those who smoke very little.

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

In a league like the Big East anything can happen. There will
always be things that surprise people and things that don’t surprise
people.

Georgetown has an overall 12-0 record and is sitting pretty on top
of the Big East at 3-0. No surprise there.

Boston College is still struggling with mediocrity and has an even
6-6 overall record, 0-3 in the Big East. No surprise there either.

What is surprising is that Pitt, which was picked by the coaches in
preseason to finish third in the conference, has the worst overall
record of Big East teams at 5-8 and is sharing the cellar with the BC
Eagles at 0-3.

Senior forward for the Panthers, Rod Brookin, didn’t expect the
poor start but isn’t about to count his team out yet.

“In a way it is surprising, but knowing the guys we have and the
coaching staff we have, we’re going to bounce back,” said Brookin.
“The wins are going to come. We’re 0-3, but it’s still early yet. A lot
of teams still have to play a lot of teams. We still have to play
everybody again, most teams twice.

“All we have to do is keep our heads up high and stick together.
We have to come together more as a team and do a lot more of the
little things right. By that I mean we all have to make our foul shots
and try to cut down on turnovers,” he added.

Foulshots have played a determining role in Pitt’s games. In the
Panthers’ five wins, they have shot almost 75 percent from the foul
line. In their losses they have taken advantage of the charity line only

Matthews adds another dimension to his game. Page 8

67 percent of the time.

But scoring usually isn’t a problem for this Panther team. All ﬁve
starters average in double figures, and they have all had 20-point
scoring nights. So, as Brookin said, it seems that it is just a matter of
coming together as a team.

But they also have to keep the opponent from putting the ball in
the hoop. “We have to step it up a notch defensively,” added
Brookin.

Pitt’s opponents are averaging 87 points per game against them.
Last year Pitt held its opponents to just over 79. The lowest point total
against Pitt this year is 71 by Robert Morris. Opponents have scored
over 90 points against Pitt five times already this season.

“We just have to work more on defense as a team,” said junior
forward Brian Shorter. “Our offense is going to come, but defensive-
wise, we just have to work harder.” I

Brookin and Shorter agree that there is not an attitude problem
with the players as there often is when things are going against a
team.

“We’re coming out with the attitude to win; that’s one of the
positive things we have going now. We just have a lack of
concentration when it comes down to making good decisions.
Sometimes we’re just too overconfident in ourselves. We have to
learn to relax and let the game go on."

Two of Pitt’s Big East losses have come against the coaches’
preseason two top— ranked teams in the conference, Syracuse and
Georgetown. But the games don’t get easier for the Panthers.

See Big East, page 10

The future for the Pittsburgh
Penguins is slowly starting to look
a little brighter. The team that had
so much hope at the beginning of
the season has instead sputtered
along in the first 42 games
searching for an identity.

Since hiring general manager/
interim coach Craig Patrick, the
Penguins have a record of. 9-6-1
and have won five of their last six.

When Patrick first arrived in
town on Dec. 8, he promised this
team would put in place a
defensive system. Under the old
regime of Tony Esposito and Gene
Ubriaco, the players pretty much
did as they pleased with no system
to follow. This caused the Penguins
to have many problems against
the teams with a system.

For some reason, a team from
Philadelphia comes to mind.

The Penguins have now
climbed to within three points of
the first place New Jersey Devils
and play them tonight at the
Meadowlands.

The Penguins have not played
to anyone’s expectations
including their new general
manager’s. They are winning
games with scores such as 6-4 or
7-5.

Patrick wasn’t going for that.

That is why on Monday the
Penguins completed a six-player
deal with the Vancouver
Canucks.

Pittsburgh traded center Dan
Quinn, right wing Andrew
McBain, and up-and-coming

wing Tony T anti, center Barry
Pederson and former Penguin
defenseman of two months ago,
Rod Buskas.

 

What this trade does is give the
Penguins some character and
defense and rids them of their
two worst plus/minus forwards.
Quinn’s plus/minus rating was a
(-16), while McBain’s was a (-9).

Tanti gives the Penguins a right

wing who can play both ends of
the rink and has proved in the
past that he can put the puck in
the net with some consistency.

this season, T anti has 14 goals
and 32 points.

Yes, Rod Buskas. The NHL’s
leading tackler is back in black-

Buskas left the Penguins under
strange circumstances. One day,

former coach Ubriaco would tell
Buskas he is an important part of
the organ-I-zation; the next, he
was told not to show up for
practice. Eventually, Esposito and
Ubriaco decided to send Buskas
to the Canucks for a sixth—round
draft choice.

All these goings-on caused team
leaders Mario lemieux and Paul
Coffey to wear black armbands
to show their disagreement with
the way Buskas was being treated.

Patrick has said that Buskas
was brought back to the team
because of all the things he has
done in the past to help this
hockey club. Patrick was
definitely trying to build character
in gaining Buskas because the

Playing the Georgetown

The game was characterized
early by intense emotion on the
part of both teams, resulting in
superfluous contact, stoppage
of play and several technical
fouls.

Matthews was caught up in
the intensity of the game and
admittedly did not make good
decisions at times.

“I just have to start pulling up
for short jump shots instead of
trying to take it all the way.

“Anytime you’re used to being

can’t pout. You’ve got to just try
to move without the ball, stand

. Matthews

Paul Diarnond/l'he Pitt News

Jason Matthews (middle), pictured here in the Syracuse game, is now called upon to mix it up with the big boys underneath the basket.

Continued from page 8

was he wound up with 19 points,

shooting 60 percent from the
field and 66.7 percent from three-
point range.

How good are the Hoyas?
Matthews believes that the guard
tandem simply augments an
already dangerous inside team.

“They’re a pretty good team,
and when Tillmon and Bryant
are hitting outside shots, that
makes them all the better. Even if
they miss, they’ve got a lot of
height up front with Dikembe
and Alonzo, and they can get the
offensive rebound.

“They also go 12 deep, so if
they want to press, they can press
and not put a strain on their
offense,” Matthews said.

Pitt’s lack of bench depth has
been an area of concern since the
season started.

Against Georgetown,
Matthews, Shorter and Rod
Brookin all played the entire
game. Georgetown substituted
five men during the course of the
game who each averaged 10
minutes of playing time.

Pitt substituted two men,
Darren Morningstar and Pat
Cavanaugh, who played 11
minutes between them.

Pitt is currently 0-3 in
conference play and 5-8 on the
season. As for what the future
holds, Matthews is optimistic.

“Two out of our three
[Conference] losses, we played
the No. 1 and 2 teams in the
nation [Georgetown and
Syracuse]. We’re not down.
Georgetown and Syracuse are
supposed to be the two toughest
teams in the league, and we’ve
played them already,” Matthews
said.

“You know, we just started.
We’re only three games into it,
and there’s 15 to go. It’s not like
we can’t turn it around.”

Big East

Continued from page 7
This Saturday Pitt travels to
New York City to take on the St.
John’s Redmen. St. John's is
undefeated in conference play

. and‘ is rated 15th in the country

by the Associated Press. A week
after that Seton Hall comes to
town to face the Panthers for a
CBS nationally televised game.
The Pirates, who lost practically
their whole NCAA runner—u p team
from last season, is surprising
everybody and is 8-3 overall.
January doesn’t get kinder as
Pitt faces Syracuse for the second

time and then Arizona, another
Top 20 team.

“We're not going to be
intimidated by anybody. Look at
the games we played against
Syracuse and Georgetown; we
weren’t afraid of their height. We
just have to keep taking it to
them,” said Brookin.

Don’t count Pitt out yet.
Remember: this is the Big East;
anything can happen.’

Panther Notes: Shorter
continues to lead the Panthers in

, “TAKE IT OFF AND

KEEP IT OFF”

STUDENT PHOGRAMMERS WANTED

COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SERVICES

, is looking for student programmers to serve in the campus

computing labs. The responsibilities of student program-
mers encompass both consulting and operations. This job
providesthe opportunity to learn and advance to higherjob
classifications based on merit evaluations.

The nature of the job requires that candidates work well
with people and have a responsible attitude. Sophomores
and juniors with good academic standing are encouraged
to apply. Applicants should have knowledge and/or expe-
rience with programming languages and applications soft-
ware on the following systems: VAX/VMS, VAX/UNIX,
DOS, and Macintosh.

Application toms are available from the Academic
Computing receptionist, 110 Old Engineering Hall.
To apply, submit an application and an unofficial fran-
script of your grades to: ~

Computing and Information Services

Lemieux’s performance also
pushed him into a tie with
Gretzky for the overall scoring-
race lead at 86 points.

Other signs of improvement
come from two players the
Penguins need at their best the
rest of the season, Coffey and
Tom Barrasso.

Since Patrick has arrived,
Coffey has been on fire. He has
placed himself back in the race
for the Norris Trophy (best
defenseman), not only with his
scoring production but with the
best defense he has played since
the Penguins acquired him. His
play has caused what was
supposed to be the most-feared.
power— play unit in the league,
to move back in the Top 10 after
early season problems. Coach
Patrick has also placed Coffey
on the penalty—killing unit as a
forward to put more fear in the
other teams’ pointrnen with
Coffey and Lemieux pressuring
them.

Barrasso has been dogged with
the injury bug all season. He has
missed games because of a
broken wrist which required
surgery and a hyperextended
elbow. On Monday night, he
won only his fourth game. The
Penguins need him! to perform
like he did in the playoffs last
year to get their first Patrick
Division title.

With the way the Patrick
Division has gone so far this

season, with most teams under ‘

.500, Patrick probably could have
held pat with this team and won
the division, but he chose not.
He is trying to build a team to
win the Stanley Cup.

With the Patrick Division
resembling the old Norris
Division, the Penguins are still
in place to win’ the division and
possibly go far in the playoffs.
The new players and the new
man at the top should help this
team ﬁnally ﬁnd the identity of a
winner. The franchise has only

‘been looking for the last 23 ,

years.
