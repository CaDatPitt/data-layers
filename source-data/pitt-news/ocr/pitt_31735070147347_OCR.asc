IN CASE YOU MISSED I1‘

Haywood out as Pitt headcoach   1

Liz Navratil
Editor in Chief

The Pitt football community went into its
second frenzy in three weeks after new head
coach Michael Haywood was arrested this
weekend for domestic violence and subse-
quently ﬁred.

The absence of Haywood, who pleaded
not guilty to domestic battery on Monday,
leaves Pitt searching for its second head coach
in less than a month and struggling to retain
recruits and assistant coaches.

“This will probably be a lost year for Pitt
with the desertion of a recruiting class,” said
Murray Chass, a Pitt alumnus who spent
decades covering sports for The New York
Times. “The wholesituation rises above the
level of coach and even football and calls
the athletic director and the chancellor into
question.”

Spokespeople for the university have re-
mained mostly mum on the situation aside
from statements released in writing and one
press conference with former head coach
Dave Wannstedt, who held the position for
six years before Haywood.

All the while, the athletic director, Steve

Pederson, has been notably absent from the .
public eye, and the Athletic Department has .

declined to release histravel schedule.
The following is a look at how Pitt football
arrived at its current state.

Haywood’s arrival and following arrest

On Dec. 16, nine days after Wannstedt
resigned under pressure, the Athletic De-
partment held a press conference ofﬁcially
announcing Haywood’s appointment as head
coach. ‘

Haywood, 46, spent the past'two years
as head coach at Miami Universitylof Ohio,
where he had 1-11 and 9—4 records with the
Red Hawks. Prior to that, he served as an as-
sistant coach at Notre Dame, Texas and LSU,
among other schools.

Pederson said Pitt chose Haywood after ‘

reviewing a list of 400 candidates because he
“exhibited the values that were in line with
the University of Pittsburgh.”

Haywood, who was set to take over a team
that saw four players arrested this season,
said he hoped to teach his athletes “to be men
of trust; to be men of integrity.”

Students, alumnireactto football fiasco v

John Manganaro
Assistant News Editor

Contrary to the steady attention paid to
Pitt this week by national media outlets
like The New York Times and ESPN, news
of head football coach Michael Haywood’s
ﬁring apparently didn’t spread quickly
among segments of Pitt’s student body
and alumni.

An informal survey of about 30 Pitt
students in Towers lobby throughout the
afternoon on Tuesday found that less than
half had heard enough of Haywood’s ar-
rest on a domestic violence charge to feel
comfortable discussing it. Few had any
comment to make about the incident or
Haywood’s not guilty plea.

Some studentslboth present and past,
however, did have thoughts to share about
the troubled state of Pittfs football pro-
gram. Those with comments included Pitt
alumnus and long-time New York Times
sports writer Murray Chass, who gradu-
ated in 1960.

“Frankly this is all tremendously em-
barrassing for alumni and the current stu-
dents and administration,” Chass said. “A
week after all this tough disciplinarian

talk and we get an incident like this -— it’s A

’ amazing.”

Chass has covered Pittsburgh and New
York sports since the 1960s,, when he was
hired by the Pittsburgh branch of the As-
sociated Press. In that time, he has seen

a number of incidents like this one, Chass.

said, and they “typically aren’t pretty.”
“I covered the Yankees during the early
George Steinbrenner era when managers
were getting ﬁred left and right,” Chass
said. “There’s always a lot of politics, es-

Murray Chass:

  
 

 

pecially when it’s not just the win—loss
record that leads to a ﬁring.” '
Chass said the reaction of alumni and
those outside of the football program is
an important part of judging how big this
incident will be for Pitt -— if these parties
are angry enough with Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg and Athletic Director Steve

Pederson for what’s happening, deeper
consequences could arise. ,
_“There’s a lot of blame to be placed
there,” Chass said. .
Fellow sports historian and former
Pittsburgh Associated Press reporter
Lou Prato agreed that blame should be
placed on the administration. During an
interview on Monday, Prato. strongly ques-
tioned Pederson.
“This kind of an incident goes back on

the‘ athletic director,” Prato’ said. “What 
kind of a search did they perform on this ‘

guy? Did they just check his criminal re-
cord? Did they get to knowlhis personality
or just make a snap decision?” '

, Officials from Pitt’s Athletic Depart-

ment weren’t available to explain the exact -

process by which they chose Haywood or.

address other questions as of press time
yesterday.

At the time of Haywood’s hiring on V

Dec. 16, Pederson said that the search for
Pitt’s new football coach involved more
than 400 candidates. He told the press
that the search “only involved college
head football coaches” and that the list
was narroweddown-to ﬁve candidates,

_ including Haywood.

“I began to travel for a series of ex-
tensive meetings with ﬁve head coaches

T over ﬁve days,” Pederson said. Haywood
' was the ﬁrst and only coach offered the
V position and was chosen at least in part

for his character as a disciplinarian, Ped-

_ erson said.

- Prato agreed that ‘Haywood’s arrest
— regardless. of the outcome of his trial
— can realistically have an impact on the
school as a whole, especially if it leads to
bad blood between officials or the loss of
donations or Universitycredibility. ‘

l “I_ don’t know Nordenberg person-

ally, but Ipcan tell you that he must have
V been pissed when he heard this news,”

Prato said. .

Pitt spokesman John Fedele declined
to comment further on the issue, but a
statement issued earlier this week by

Who will coach next?

A list of potential candidates for the Pitt football head coaching job

Lauren Kirschman
Assistant Sports Editor

With the Pitt football head coaching job
open once again, The Pitt News takes
a look at a few prospective coaching
candidates.

Phil Bennett, Pitt defensive coordi—_
nator

Bennett will serve as Pitt’s interim head
coach during the BBVA Compass Bowl on
Jan. 8. He arrived at Pitt in 2008, and in
2009, the Panthers led the country in
sacks and ranked 23rd in total defense,

Tom Bradley, Penn State defensive
coordinator

Bradley’s been on the Penn State coa'ch—‘
ing staff for 33 years and he might be ready
to take over a program of his own. His
name has been attached to both the Pitt
and Connecticut coaching searches and
he’s coordinated one of the nation’s top
defenses for the past11 years. In 2009, the
Nittany Lions ranked among the top 15 in
all six major defensive categories. Bradley
also served as a recruiting coordinator
during several of his years on the staff,
bringing in various prep school stars. If

‘Haywood 4 2

So it caught most people by surprise when
police in South Bend, Ind., arrested Haywood
at 3:10 p.m. on New Year’s Eve.

Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Thomas
J. Sanders wrote in court documents that
he believes Haywood placed a woman with
whom he has a 21-month-old son in a choke-
hold outside their South Bend home and then

~ threw her backward. . -

The police report, also ﬁled in court, said
that when officers arrived outside the home
about 2:30‘ p.m., the woman and Haywood
were separated.

According to the police report, Haywood
and the woman were “in the midst of a child
custody battle” and had been arguing over
child custody and parenting time arrange-
ments. The woman decided to take the child
to a re1ative’s house and placed him in the
car.

Officers wrote that they found “dark red

marks on [the woman’s] neck and lower face/ A
jaw area, a small raised mark on her back, and l

redness on her lower right arm.”

_ Theewoman told police that Haywood
placed her in a chokehold and pushed her
backward, causing her to hit a wheelbarrow
and experience pain. -

Haywood offered a different account. Ac— ‘

cording to the police report, Haywood told .

ofﬁcers that when the woman unlocked her
car to get in and drive away, he tried to grab
the child, she grabbed his shirt to stop him
and he pushed her away with his_arm. He

’ said that the woman fell and he then helped

her up. ‘
When asked how the woman received

the marks on her neck, Haywood said that

“whe_n she is upset or angry, her neck, face

and chest turn red. The redness I could see '

was a result of her emotional state,” according
to the police report. y
Officers wrote in their report that they

Pederson misses team practice

day featuring Wannstedt, who discussed
his role withthe University. ‘

According to the Post-Gazette’s Pitt
football beat reporter Paul Zeise, Peder~
son did not attend the team’s practice on
Sunday, which is unusual. Instead, Nor-
denberg addressed the players about the
current situation as they prepared to head
to Birmingham, Ala., for their Saturday
bowl game.

When asked about Pederson’s plans for
the bowl game, E._]. Borghetti, a spokes-
man for the athletic department, declined
to comment about the athletic director’s
travel plans. _

Throughout the entire ordeal, Peder-
son spoke to the "media only once, in a
one-paragraph release Monday afternoon.
Pederson discussed Wannstedt’s decision
not to coach the Panthers in the BBVA
Compass Bowl on Saturday and the fact
that defensive coordinator Phil Bennett
will serve as interim head coach.

Even so, Pederson received a vote of
conﬁdence from Nordenberg.

“Steve Pederson has played a key role
in elevating Pitt’s athletics programs,

‘ remains an important member of the

University’s senior leadership team and
continues to enjoy the full support of the

- chancellor,” Pitt spokesman E.J. Borghetti

said in a statement.

Pederson served as Pitt’s athletic di-
rector from 1996 to 2002 before he left
to serve as Nebraska’s athletic director,
where he was highly criticized for his
coaching decisions. ,

After a 9-3 season for the Cornhusk—
ers’ football team, Pederson — in just his
second year at Nebraska — ﬁred six—year

L head coach Frank Solich before the team’s

bowl game. .
, Pederson was fired three years later,

- then returning to Pitt. .

‘ 6 Screwed” is a small word to

With a shiny-new head coach

a monthbefore recruits’ signing
deadline, few would paint rosy ho-
rizons for the Panthers in a confer-
ence that’s about to get much more
competitive. _ .

nocence, but rather it was made
with the “strong belief that moving
forward_ with Mr. Haywood as our
head coach is not possible under
the existing circumstances.”

This occurredvonly two weeks
after Haywood was picked to re-
place.Dave Wannstedt, the outgo-
ing head coach who resigned on
Dec. 7 but who has been offered

a position as special assistant to

the athletic director.‘
4 Whatever conclusions trickle

‘ out of Haywood’s trial, one thing’s

for sure: The past few weeks have
been an embarrassment to Pitt’s
athletic program. The coaching
debacle threatens to undermine
the Pitt football team’s' competi-
tiveness in a stronger Big East
4 Rose Bowl—champion Texas
Christian University will join the
conference in two years — and
diminish the Pitt athletic brand
as a whole.

Given the importance of sports
to our University, we at The Pitt
News are more than just a tad
concerned.

Let’s consider the fate of Pitt
recruiting, perhaps the most im-
portant factor in improving teams
and winning titles. As Haywood
said himself at his introductory

— «press co‘nference,~“--Recruiting is -

\»‘._ w q A n I|9$)n'v

< . . \ . . . . - .

the bloodline to any institution.”
Since Athletic Director Steve
Pederson and the department-

' are now scrambling to ﬁnd a vi-

able leader with a recognized
name only weeks before the Feb.
2 signing deadline, what recruit
should be expected to choose Pitt?
Prospective players are looking -
with good reason —’— for programs
touting solidiﬁed leadership with ‘
clear goals and heavily vetted ways
,to achieve those goals, but at this

' point we can think of little Pitt can

offerother than an NFL stadium
to play in.

We have already seen how dif- '

ﬁcult recruiting has become. Since
Wannstedt resigned, only six out

’ of 19 recruits remain intending-

to sign.

But it’s theoretically possible to .

forestall such a recruiting dip, es- ,
pecially if the Athletic Department
makes a strong coaching choice,
which is another issue entirely.
We’d like to know more about what
actually goes on in the coach—se—
lection process, who is involved
and what values are applied. Will
the process change any in light of ,
this controversy? ~ . '
., As well, the Haywood incident
could easily affect the University’s
students and its image in general.
Willstudent attendance to games
or the number of overall applica-
tions change? Will ESPN continue

to broadcast Pitt games as it has ~

this year? Will thedreaded day
come when we can no longer make
fun of West Virginia without feel-
ing disingenuous? .

The list of questions goes on
and on. .

Over the next few weeks,_ The
Pitt News will try to navigate the
innumerable issues and unan-
swered. questions left festering in
the aftermath of Haywood’s ﬁr-
ing, providing follow-up content
in print and on the Web.

BEHIND THE REISERS

Ins andoutsof 2011

Becky Reiser
Managing Editor

 

2010 was a pretty bad year. A lot
of people died, a lot of people were
‘ unemployed, and the Black Eyed
Peas reworked that song from that
movie with the formerly big-nosed
girl who ‘won “Dancing With the
Stars.” '

It’s time to get the taste of
2010 out of our mouths; We need
a rebirthing where the cool gets
wrapped in a snarky, fresh-faced,
new media Snuggie —— in-th-en,

4 out-now, likely in again..It’s time

for an Ins and Outs list for 2011.
None of this is based on any
evidence except the most anec-

dotal. However, I fancy myself a.

pretty keen social observer. Se-
riously, I even went to New York
recently. I saw “Black Swan” and
read a couple ofjonathan Franzen
novels over break. I’ve done the
work and am ready to disabuse

‘you of your backward world view
(Note: I am not trendy nor do I
fancy this a trendy list. Trends
are out — circa 2005 and “I Love
the 9os”).

Irony: Out.

2010 was good to irony. After
the mid-decade boom that cli-
maxed into “I Love You, Man” and
“Bromance,” 2010 was the year
when irony broke the mold. Sar-
casm and childhood cartoons: All
of these were made to seem sincere
by the ironic onslaught that was

V 2010. Wehad rat-tailed fashioni-

stas wearing animal hat-scarves
called Spirit Hoods. We had fair-
trade tea shops that hosted “Deci-
sion Points” readings. This article
was drafted. Blackrappers got a
lot whiter (Kid Cudi), and every
college party I went to in Oakland
played both Wu-Tang and “Juicy.”
(Note: There were very few black
people at these parties)

Ever sincejon Stewart did that
seriousepisode and helped those
Sept. 11 ﬁrst responders, irony has
been on the downturn. Callingyour
parents, reading books that were
written in the ’40s, medium—sized
glasses frames, watching better-

‘ than-average ﬁlms from the ’70s

and cargo pants are ﬁnally in fash-
ion. This year is the year of trying
because not trying went out with
“Garden Groove” and trying too

hard went out with 2010.
Football coaches: Out. Liter-

ally. ‘
In case you haven’t been read-

ing the news — and let’s be seri-

_ ous, no one has over break, mainly

because there has been little news
— Michael Haywood, Pitt foot-
ball’s newly appointed head coach,
was ﬁred after he was charged
with felony domestic battery in
the presence of a child. This was
the second Pitt football coach to
leave within the last month ——
Dave Wannstedt “resigned” in
December. , '

Rooting for Pittsburgh

You know how I know when the
Penguins lost a game? It’s the only

- time my news feed on both Twitter

and Facebook goes absent of Pens
references. Fanatics posts about
how much they love Evgeni Malkin
or how much better Sidney Crosby
is than Alexander Ovechkin are
abundant and overused every time
the Pens win a game. Same goes for
the Steelers. We get it already.

Four Loko:‘ In. But maybe
for the ﬁrst time since it’s been

Like an autumn squirrel to acorns, the

college student has diligently hoarded

enough Four Loko to survive a brief apoca-
lypse. Drinking post—prohibition, Four Loko
is as cheap and dangerous as ever, but now
it also carries a sexy air of disobedience.

Putting puzzles together has always been
something I’ve associated with nursing
homes or kindergarten. Now, puzzles are

‘ back with a vengeance, taking up space on

toy store shelves and hipster coffee shops.
Not only are they cool again, but they don’t
require an outlet, making this pastime con-
venient for eco—friendly readers or during
a snow-in.

Cupcakes: Out.

I love sugary confections as much as the
next girl, but food trends tell us that our
favorite birthday treat is deﬁnitely out. With
the inception of the hip Voodoo.Doughnut
in Portland, Ore., doughnuts are the new

cupcake. Unlike cupcakes, it is socially ac-
ceptable to eat doughnuts for breakfast, and
with multiple Dunkin’ Donuts popping up in
Pittsburgh, they are convenient and cheap,
perfect for the nearly-broke-unti1—parents-

. give—allowance college students. Carrying

around a cupcake is messy, and doughnuts
get the job done without the wrapper.
Open-source software: In.
Anyone that already knows what this is
knows that it’s always been in. For those of
you who aren’t familiar with open sourc-

This new year, open-source is the new free sampling

ing, think of it like you think of a free food
sample at Costco. Patrons are eager to help
themselves to a product, but thenare also
likely to turn around and make something
with it. In essence, the world becomes a
‘ better place when things don’t require ex-
pensive copyright licenses, or-in a Costco
shopper’s case, a full-price block of artisan
cheese. '

Easily one of the most accessible
forms of distraction for the average
college student, the ever-growing
trend of viral videos is the perfect
way to jumpstart your brain after
several hours spent staring at a
textbook. ‘

But how can we explain the viral-
video phenomenon? John Lyne, a
professor in Pitt’s Communication
Department, attributes the success

of viral videos to our generation’s'

“social networking habits,” or the
ability to share anything online with
just the click of a few buttons.

“When YouTube came along, it
opened up the possibility of eas-
ily sharing videos. It became a big

part of our culture with astounding.

speed. One day we will be able to

transf_ormative,” Lyne said.

Another draw might even be
the few moments of fame a good
Internet Video can garner. With the
likelihood of getting an agent and
actually becoming abig name in the
entertainment business as slim as
it is, the idea that you could throw
together a clever video and, within
a few hours, get some attention on
the Internet is a big draw for some
people, Lyne explained.

“I do think fame is ‘a part of the

Derek Pharr, Sporcle ’s Vice President discusses Sporcle’s beginnings dnd why it_’s so popular with Pitt students

Patrick Wagner
St_a_[fW1ji ter

During the last few weeks of .

the fall semester, «Pitt students
weren’t just studying or check-
ing Facebook, but also using the
Internet quiz site Sporcle to test
themselves on everything from
movie directors to organic chem-
istry to the Cathedral of Learn-
ing’s Nationality Rooms.

Pitt was ranked in the top 15
schools to use the site for several

v weeks in a row, ﬁnishing at No. .13
. for the week of Dec. 12-18, ahead

of bigger schools like the Univer-
sity of Minnesota and the Univer-
sity of Massachusetts. To get the
scoop on Sporcle and its College
Ranking System, we talked to its
vice president of products, Derek"
Pharr from Seattle.

Q: Could you brieﬂy describe _

how Sporcle came together? What
was the creation process‘?

A: Matt Ramme, in Seattle,
started the site in 2007. He’s a
big New York Times crossword
fan, and he wanted to get better.

MOVIE REVIEW

 

Coensreimagine ‘True Grit’ asblack comedy ~

January 5, ‘2o11|i'[he Pitt News I7  .pittneWs”.c‘om

‘ihe brothers crafted afilm that is_ quite different from the 1969 movie version by taking the"b‘ook’s lead with dark humor ,

Jeffrey Ihaza
Staff Writer

7?True Grit” I

Starring: Hailee Steinfeld,]eff Bridges,
Matt Damon,_]osh Brolin

Directed by: Joel & Ethan Coen

Film studio: Paramount Pictures
Grade: A

The western genre is one often fueled
by vengeance and “True Grit,” The Coen
brothers’ latest foray into the genre, is
no exception. ’

Based on the 1968 novel by Charles Por-
13',s, “True Grit” tells the story of 14-year-'
old Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld), whose
father was murdered by Tom Chaney (Josh
Brolin). Mattie narrates the story in ret-~
rospect when she is much older.

The young girl enlists the help of
Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) to seek
vengeance for her father’s murder. Cog-
burn is a described merciless U.S. Marshal
who frequently brags about his bloody

exploits. Another U.S. Marshal, LaBoeuf
(Matt Damon) has ‘been on the trail of
Chaney and eventually teams up with
Cogburn to capture him.

The Coen brothers have a certain niche
when it comes to ﬁlms about manhunts. As
far back as “Fargo” the duo‘ has exhibited
a certain specialty in captivating audi-
ences with the search. “True Grit” furthers
this cinematic tradition; in addition to the
tremendous performance given by Brolin,
the Coen brothers’ rendition of Chaney
creates an atmosphere of suspense akin
to what they achieved in “No ‘Country for
Old Men.”

This isn’t the first time that Portis’ nov-
el has been adapted for the screen. In fact
the 1969 version of the ﬁlm garneredjohn

Waynehis only Oscar. However, the Coen_

brothers’ adaptation of the novel cannot
be viewed as a remake of the 1969 ﬁlm, but
instead a reimagining of the original novel.
For one, there is far more humor in the
Coen brothers’ version. This isn’t without
good reason —— the novel is told almost
entirely in the perspective of a 14-year-old

BOOK COLUMN

Readers need diversity in their regular literary diets

With common reading often by white, male, Western writers, readers should consider branching out in their books :3

Tracey Hickey
Columnist

I don’t usually go in for chain Facebook
notes, but when I was tagged in one asking
me to_list 15 ﬁctional characters that would
stick with me forever, I couldn’t resist. _
At first glance, my list of characters —
from Hermione Granger to the joyfully
eccentric 80-year-old Maude from “Harold
and Maude” —— was pretty diverse. But
upon statistical analysis, a few similarities
stuck out at me. I 
Ten of my 15 fictional characters-were
white women. More broadly, 11 of the 15

» were women, and 13 of the,15 were /white. I
- Three were British and the rest were Amer-

ican. All were heterosexual.

I had found my New Year’s resolution.

I am not demonizing the-natural ten-
dency of human beings to relate to, iden-
tify with and seek out representations of
people who are like them. But I don’t think
the lack of diversity in what I read is that
simple. I had four male characters on my

‘ ‘N
_  ,.Ag,:‘l
:.- 

list, but of all- the men I know who compiled
their own lists, none cited more than one
woman as a major life inﬂuence, and most
didn’t cite any.

These guys are not chauvinists. Overall,

they are men who I believe respect and.
' value women. I would even consider some

of them feminists — and as a women’s
studies student, my standards are high.

So what’s going on? *
My theory isthat because the Western
literary establishment promotes and val-
ues the work of white, Western men above
allothers, the closer you are to being a
white, Western man, the more exclusively
you will consume literature by and about
people like you, unless you actively seek

out alternatives.

On the ﬂip side, if you are a minority
or a woman, you might seek out literature
about people like you, but it’s likely that
white male writers will remain a staple
of your literary diet. Furthermore, this
is normalized. My all—heterosexual list
of inﬂuential characters passed without
comment, but if a gay reader compiled such

a list and didn’t include a single straight
character, he would probably encounter at
least some teasing —‘that is, if anyone had
ever heard of the characters he listed.

In her essay, “White Privilege: Unpack-
ing The Invisible Knapsack,” Peggy McIn-
tosh lists 50 examples from her life of ways
in which she beneﬁts from white privilege.

Point 31 reads:_“I can choose to ignore
developments inminority writing  or
disparage them, or learn from them, but
in any case, I can ﬁnd ways to be more or
less protected from negative consequences
of any of these choices.”

This summariz_es neatly the double
standard that I feel is at play when people
of different social identities shop their

‘ local libraries.

Although I would be the ﬁrst to argue

. that a truly well-read person ought to have

some diversity in his or her reading list, I
have not walked the walk. I have only read
for pleasure one book by a nonwhite au-
thor (junot Diaz) —- “The Brief Wondrous
Life of Oscar Wao” — in the past year. I
have not taken the time to read even that
black literature which is well—known and
praised by mainstream literary critics. I
have not read Toni Morrison’s “Song of
Solomon” or any of the works of Maya An-
gelou or Langston Hughes, and I only read
“Their Eyes Were Watching God” when
it was assigned. As McIntosh predicts, I
have been more or less —— in fact, I would

FASHION COLUMN

Instead of dropping Weight,

Girmai resolves to lose the Uggs

Girmai makes a list of fashion resolutions for the New Year

I Bethie Girmai
Columnist

The holiday season is also a season of
lists; shopping, Santa’s naughty and nice,
etc. But now that those lists have been
checked through, it’s time to start making
the most daunting of all: the New Year’s
resolutions. -

In past years, I’ve resolved to lose 10
pounds, give up swearing and abstain
from spending all my Christmas money on
New Year’s Day sales, all unsuccessfully.
Someday, I might actually get to the gym
and read a book-on etiquette, but there’s

really no hope for my credit cards.

So this New Year’s, I’ve decided to de-
clare my style resolutions and I’m inviting
you to do the same. The dawn of a new
year is as perfect a time as any to revamp

. your wardrobe. If you follow my. simple

resolutions, you’ll have some new style
to go with the new year.

1. Resolve to reinvent tired trends. .

There are some trends that just refuse

to go away. But just because a trend is past ’

its peak, it doesn’t necessarily mean it was
-bad, it’s just run its course.

Case in point‘? Ugg boots. Personally, I
I own three different pairs. But I have
resolved to refrain from wearing them in .

public places, and I have several reasons
why. Technically, they’re not even ap-

propriate for inclement weather as snow.

melts through the boots and leaves your
feet to freeze, and thestreet salt ruins
them. Also, they look like two loaves of
bread on your feet. Sorry, Uggs are offi-
cially blacklisted inmy wardrobe.

' Riding and motorcycle boots are so
in this season and generally are every
season. They’re great alternatives to Uggs
because they’re not a trend; therefore,
they will never go out of style.

Fringe boots are also leaps and bounds.

more fashionable than Uggs. They’ll keep

you warm, while adding an eccentric and

innovative quality to your style.
2. Resolve to take fashion risks.

Don’t be afraid to play around with

‘your style this New Year. I’m not suggest-

ing you don a meat dress, compliments
of Lady Gaga, circa the 2010 VMAs. But
don’t hesitate to step ‘outside-of~the pro-
verbial fashion box. Explore a new trend

I or try something you never thought your

personal style could pull off. ‘
For example, turbans are popping up

b all over the streets and runways these -

days. They’re great for accessorizing a

. casual outﬁt or complementing a dressy ‘

one. Turbans are versatile and made in

several different styles, so it’s easy to find A

a style that ﬂatters your face shape.
Another chic trend is the snake and

reptile jewelry and accessories that have

been slithering all over the red carpets.

3. Resolve to dress up. .

Yes, we’re college students. And,

yes, we live in a city that constantly suf-
fers from inclement weather. However,

I that’s absolutely no excuse to dress like

aslob. A A .
If you wear sweatpants to class, I’m

talking to you. If you pair them with .

sneakers, you’re even worse off than I
thought. Andfor you ladies who think
heavy makeup will make me forget you’re
wearing your 2001 basketball camp sweat-
pants, you are sorely mistaken.

Our time in'college prepares us to en-
ter the job market. Even though it might
seem likecollege will never end, the “real
world” is right around the corner..There—
fore, we have to start dressing for the jobs
we want, not the jobs we have.

Obviously, your weekly chem lab isn’t

a black tie affair. So when you’re dress- .

ing for class, think casual and dress up
your outfit with accessories. Nice jeans,
a long-sleeved tee, paired with a scarf and

they become viral.”

Both Lyne and Demaree agree that fame
is part of the allure for adding a video, but
there’s a different kind of appeal for the av-
erage YouTube patron. Ben Mayer, host of
Pittsburgh’s Friday Nite Improv, attributes
trends in viral videos to the competitive nature
of social networking. _ _ _

Q “I think some of the appeal of YouTube and
things like it are that people know they may
be catching the “next big thing” before their

friendssee it. There is a sense of discovery -

when you ﬁnd a video on YouTube that is hi-
larious and that your friends haven’t seen. It
is fun to share it with other people and kind of

take side credit just for being the first among -

your friends to ﬁnd it,” Mayer explained.

Regardless of your taste in comedy, there
will always be something for everyone on You-
Tube, whether it is a video of a cat playing
a piano oran Auto—Tuned Mel Gibson rant,
there’s bound to be something" out there that
will make even the biggest Debbie Downer

Pitt ranks high on Sporcle’s lists?

Sporcle 4 16

as well. 
Q: Everything’s connected on the In-
ternet these days; be it through Facebook,

Twitter or what have you. Would you look :

at Sporcle as a form of social media?

A: Social media has, depending on which
angle you come at it, kind of this odd con-
notation. We have a very strong community

on‘ our site,‘ and people feel very passion— ‘

Derek Pharr:

ately about it, and we’re trying to build
more features around connecting people
because people have made connections
with the site. I know people have become
friends  someone even asked us to add a
dating service into Sporcle  I wouldn’t
lump us in with social media, but I’d say
there’s‘deﬁnitely a strong community and
we really want to foster that.

Q: Could you tell me a little bit about
the Sporcle College Ranking System? How
did that come about and how is it deter-
mined? ‘

A: It’s something we’ve wanted to do for
a long time, and we ﬁnally got it together
in the fall, and we’ve had a really good re-
sponse to it. We have a formula that tracks
the data and we polish it from time to time.

- It takes into account things like time spent
on the site and games played and page views '

and stuff’ like that. Another thing that fac-
tors in is if you sign up for an account on

Sporcle, you can s‘et.your college and that
‘helps as well.

Q: The University of Pittsburgh is ahead
of much larger schools on the ranking sys-

. tem. Why do you think Pitt has been so

-at
strong on the site?

A: The numbers game can always help,
but [it’s more complex] since we take into
account time spent as well as games played.
My hope is that students are using it for
study guides and it’s resonating more Lin
that function]. It’ll be interesting to see
in the next few months how things ﬁuctu—
ate.

Q: What’s next for Sporcle?

A: We just put out an Android app that

V goes along with our iPhone app that we put

out last February, and we’ve had a really
good response with that. We have more
coming for the iPhone world; we want to
do more with the college leader board so
we have plans to open that up. a little bit
and improve it  a whole big laundry list of
things we want to get into. We want to busiid
on'the things we’ve done in the past year
and add to them in the next few months.

Q: Is there anything else you’d like to
communi'cate about Sporcle?

A: We feel like we’re in this fairly unique
place where yes, we’re this diversionary ac-
tivity but we’re also an educational activity.
Not to sound too hokey, but I feel like we’re
in a crossroads where these two things meet
on the Web. We hope that people just get
into it and go from there. ‘

“True Grit” is an example of where the
Coen brothers are as directors —. every
scene is masterfully crafted and every line
carries the ﬁlm forward. The casting, as
with most of the Coen brothers’ films, is

, impeccable. Brolin seems almost to have .
been born for his role as Chaney, whereas
newcomer Steinfeld couldn’t have given -

a better portrayal of Mattie. Each per-

consequences of my ignorance.

, Think about it this way. If I were an Asian
woman who read virtually nothing but lit-

» erature by and pertaining to Asian people,
' if I had only read threebooks by non-Asian

authors in the past year, if I had never read
a word of the canon from Shakespeare to

I . Vonnegut, would I be considered well-read? ‘

I highly doubt that no one would take notice
of the fact that most of my reading list was
comprised of writers of my ‘own race.

So my New Yea_r’s resolution is to begin
actively. and earnestly seeking to diversify
my reading palate. Because although those
who are not white, Western men will always
beexposed to the work of thosewho are,
people in the majority will remain largely
ignorant about the work of minority‘wri'ters
unless they actually seek it out. And I feel
I have a responsibility to do exactly that. I

would recommend others do the‘ same. I’

City Council passes pension solution’

Michael Macagnone
News Editor

The state is not likely to take over the
city’s struggling pension ﬁind after
City Council passed aﬁmdingplan the
day before the state’s deadline.

Council passed the plan and
overrode a mayoral veto on Thurs-
day, Dec. ‘30 of last week, pledging
revenue from the next 30 years of
parking taxes as the main source of
ﬁinding for the plan. The $735 mil-
lion infusion is expected to bring the
pension ﬁind pastthe state-mandated
50 percent threshold needed to avoid
a takeover.

Currently the city’s pension obli-
gations are just less than 30. percent
ﬁinded.

Each year, at least $13 million from
the parking tax will go into the fund

as part of the annual budget. After
2018, the armual contributions will
increase to more than $26 million,
about 6 percent of the city’s current
$435 million budget.

"The increase in2o18 comes from a
reduction in the city’s debt payments
plannedfor tl1atyear,ﬁeeingup some
$48 million in the budget.

A state takeover of the city’s pen-
sionfundwouldhave meantincreased,
mandatory contributions from the
city that could likely only come from

- service cuts and tax increases for city

residents. Areportfrom the Pennsyl-
vania Municipal Retirement System,
which manages municipal pensions,
estimated that contributions to the
pension fund might have reached a
quarter of the city’s budget under a
state takeover. A T
Pittsburgh is one of a few munici-
palities in the state which funds and

manages its own pension fund. Most
of the municipal pension funds are
run by the state’s retirement system.
Mayor Luke Ravenstahl had sup-
ported a series of plans to lease the
city’s parking assets to JPMorgan
Chase and other private investors for
50 years. Some funds from the lease
would have gone to boostthe pension
plan past the 50 percent level.
Council voted the plans down over
the course of last few months, citing
concerns about increasing parking
rates and the length of the lease. The
mayor’s office could not be immedi-
ately reached for comment. .
Another planwould have involved
a sale of the city’s parking assets to
the Pittsburgh Parking Authority. Ra-
venstahl vetoed the plan and Coun-
cil could not muster enough votes to
override it.
The city’s pension plan has been

under threat of a state takeover since '

2009. The state legislature passed Act
44 that year, which said that the city
needed to make certain the _pension
would be funded to at leastso percent
of its obligations byjan. 1, 2011, or risk
takeover by the state. 4‘

The system would have managed
the ﬁmds and mandated contribu-
tions from the city.

The Intergovernmental Coop-
eration Authority, a state-appointed

- board that oversees Pittsburgh’s pen-

sion ﬁmdingand budget, approved the
Council’s solution in a letter. Another

-state agency, the Public Employee Re-

tirement Commission, will have to
approve Council’s plan to ﬁnally avoid
atakeover. *
Despite the seven-vote ‘majority
for the latest plan — only Councilman

‘ Rev. Ricky Burgess voted against it ——

feelings amongthe Council members

were mixed.

Councilman Doug Shields said he
supported the plan, because it avoided
giving over the city’s assets, borrow-
ingmoney or raising taxes. ,

“It’s the best solution I’d heard
of,” he said. “We have set the city up
for success. This is a solution for the
pension issue. No one has done that
before.”

Councilwoman Theresa Kail-
Smith had aless-rosy view of the situa-
tion. Smith saidthat Council’s solution
was far from ideal, however she voted
for it to address the pension funding
problem without raising taxes. 1*

“I voted for it because it was the
last option on the table,” she said. “It
wasn’t an ideal situation.”

She said that Council should have
laid outallofthe pros and cons of each
of the various options, rather than
leaving only one option for the last

“A lot of conversation thatwe need
to have hasn’t happened yet,” she said.
“Hopefullyintimewe’ll come up with

One of her major concerns with
the ordinance was the $13 million
in revenue taken out of the budget,
which will ‘need to be addressed to
avoid future tax increases or service
cuts.

Shields said that Council should
be able to nip and tuck different parts
of the budget in order to ﬁll the hole.
Shields said thatthe options included
salary freezes and leaving vacated
positions temporarily unﬁlled.

Kail—Srnith said thatcuts like that
might impede the city’s ability to func-

Athletic Department spokesman E;J. Bor-
ghetti said, “Steve Pederson has played a key
role in elevating Pitt’s athletics programs,
remains an important member of the Univer-
sity’s senior leadership team and continues to
enjoy the full support of the chancellor.”

Still, Haywood’s arrest does not exactly
spell disaster for Pitt football; Prato said. Hay,-I
wood is not the only coach in recent college
football history to be forced out of a program

hired Price in December of the previous year,
and he never took the ﬁeld as head coach

. during a game.

Alabama won last year’s BCS National
Championship over Texas. A

“Of course all this character type stuff re-
ally means something,” Prato said. “Parents
want their kids to play for the right school and .
theright education and the right coach.”

have rebounded nicely from such troubles.

In 2001, Notre Dame head coach George
O’Leary resigned after just ﬁve days at the
helm following reports that he fabricated key
elements on his resumé, including a phony
master’s degree in education. Today, Notre
Dame is still considered a top football pro-
gram, Prato said.

Two years later, in May of 2003, the Uni-
versity of Alabama ﬁred head coach Mike
Price for actions, that included a much pub-
licized visit to a strip ‘club. The university had

reported feeling that Pitt did the right thing ~

in ﬁring the new coach, though some still
weren’t sure Wannstedt should have gone in

.. the ﬁrst place.

“It’s never good publicity when a coach is
tied to any kind of violence,” said sophomore
Bryan Seelnacht during a_mid—afternoon meal
in Market Central. “It doesn’t matter if he’s
guilty, really. The bowl game is even more

pointless now, too. I’ll still be rooting for Pitt '

as the head coach of Tulsa with an overall.

record of 36-17. This season, he led the
Golden Hurricanes to a 10-3 record and
a 62-35 win over Hawaii in the Sheraton
Hawaii Bowl. In his ﬁrst two seasons,
Graham posted two consecutive 10-win
seasons — ei first in Tulsa history. In 2007
and 2008, the Golden Hurricanes had the
nation’s top—ranked offense, averaging
543.9 and 569.9 yards per game, respec-
tively. This year, the’Golden Hurricanes
averaged 504.89 yards per game. Graham
has been successful as a head coach, but
he’s not a big name that’s going to instantly
inject excitement back into the Pitt foot-

‘ ball program.

Pitt destroyed West Virginia’s national
title hopes in what’s known in Pittsburgh
as simply “13—9.” Flash-forward a few
years and Rodriguez is looking for another
coaching job. Michigan- ﬁred Rodriguez
after the Wolverines’ 52-14 loss to Mis-
sissippi State in the Gator.Bowl. He went
15-22 in three seasons with Michigan, but-
during his time ‘at West Virginia, Rodriguez
won four co.nference’titles and compiled

‘ a 60-26 record. Michigan’s offense was

sixth in the country in total yards with
500.9 per game, but the team struggled
defensively, allowing 33.8 points per game. >
There’s no doubt Rodriguez is a quality
football coach, but his seasons at Michigan
are troubling, and his actions might make
Pitt nervous as the Panthers attempt to
avoid any more off—the—field issues. The
NCAA investigated Michigan’s football
program this past year for violating prac-
ti erules.  . c,

Pitt quiet on

termination

Haywood 4 11
declined to comment.
The decision to ﬁre

‘ Hours aﬁter Haywood was released from
jail, Pitt announced that it had ﬁred the coach.
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg saidinastatement
that the University’s decision does not reﬂect
whetheritbelieves Haywoodwillbefound guilty
or not guilty, but rather “it reﬂects a strongbelief
that moving forward with Mr. Haywood as our
head coach is not possible under the 
circumstances.” , ’
“This is a matter of real regret for the many
people at Pittwho hadlookedforwardtoworking
with him,” Nordenberg said. “However, head.
coaches are amongthe University’s most visible
representatives and are expected to maintain
high standards of personal conduct and to avoid
situations that mightreﬂect negatively on the
University.” _
As the national media churned out stories of
H_aywood’s ﬁring —— The New York Times, USA
Today and ESPN among dozens of other outlets
covered the story — some called into question
Pederson’s status as athletic director at Pitt.
Pederson, who has not appeared publicly
since Haywood’s arrest or ﬁring, served as Pitt_’s —
athletic director from 1996-2002 before moving
to the University of Nebraska.
. ' In Nebraska, he drew the ire of fans after
ﬁring head football coach _Frank Solich, who

had 7-7a.nd '9-3 records the two seasons before. ‘

Pederson experienced trouble ﬁlling coaching
positions and was ﬁred at Nebraska in 2,007. '
The same year, he returned to Pitt as athletic
director. The University continues to support
Pederson publicly. .
“Steve Pederson has played a key role in el ‘

evating Pitt’s athletics programs, remains an -

important member of the University’s senior

leadership team and continues to enjoy the full ‘

support of the Chancellor,” spokesman E.]. Bor-
ghetti said in a statement Saturday.
