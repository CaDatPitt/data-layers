Select May 1
at As  Day

Deans Grant Holiday To All
Campus Schools

Approval of May 1 as a. holiday
on which will be held interfraternity
sweepstakes, interfraternity track
meets, parade of the Pan-therettes,
senior farewell dances, honorary

tapping exercises and other events
formerly staged during" Pitt Week,
has been granted by. the deans of
the undergraduate schools. This ac-
tion of the administration will be
presented to Student Council next
Wednesday night for formal accept-
ance by the students.

Granting of the holiday is an out-
come of a proposal made to Student
Council last October when four se-
nior men asked Council to advance
certain Senior Week events to a
date early in May, in which the en-
tire University takes an interest. It
v.as held by the four men making
the recommendation that these
events were not patronized because
under existing arrangements they
come after the close of regular
campus classes. Other events which
are more dis-tinictly Senior class af-

fairs, such as the Senior breakfast,

class luncheons and deans’ recep-
tions, will continue to be held dur-
ing the days immediately preceding
spring graduation exercises in June.

With the grant of the holiday on
May 1, the administration has stipu-
lated that the annual football holi-

. day in the fall should be eliminated.

Alth-ougih thisplan was not consid-
ered by Student Council, it is ex-
pected to have little effect on the
probable decision of the governing
body to accept the spring holiday.
Charles Seidle, Col. ’31, chairman
of Student Relations committee of
Student Council, who presented the
proposal to the administration, ex-
pressed satisfaction with the deci-
sion made this week by the deans.
He said that the week-end of May 1
will probably be devoted to Senior
events, with affairs being staged
Thursday night, all day Friday, Fri-
day night and Saturday. The annual
tapping exercises which have al-
ready been scheduled for May 1 will

, be incorporated as pant of the pro-

gram.

Dr. Williams Pays For Extensive Knowledge
By Careful Examination Of His Food

Dr. Williams of the Zoology department looks through his breakfast
cereals for some trace of hookworm or some other such animal which is
liable to infest his shredded wheat or corn flakes.
in his breakfast maneuvers is a sight not only for sore eyes but for healthy

To watch Dr. Williams

It is in this way that Herr Doctor has to pay for the knowledge which
has made him an outstanding ﬁgure in Pitt's zoology department. Never

breakfast without some suspicion
that a PIPUNCTATUS TURBEL-
LARIUS or some such dreadful form
is infesting his “petite dejeuner.”
And never can he close his eyes with
the reckless abandon of the rest of
us braneaters and say “ahhh, that’s
wonderful?’ It just can't be done
until several microscopes have been
brought in and various tests taken
of the thing before he is able to di
his soupspoon in a bowl of puﬁe
rice, if that's where you stick soup-
spoons.

And to think that “le’grand doc-
teur” has eaten snakes and monkeys
and even other things which have
never graced the table at Child's or
even the Greasy Spoon. Now if the

can the honorable doctor eat a good<‘>

erudite doctor should refuse to eat
pork or some other forms because
of the familiarity which has resulted
from a long study, we might excuse
him, but bran and shredded wheat-—
never. ’

Notre professeur has never given
us any of the effects of the great
search for animals in oatmeal and
whole wheat bread. It has probably
become as natural as examining a
culture or playing tag with “Boozy”
the monkey in the barn. But when
it comes to searching‘ one’s chocolate
soda for “Seliriurs Boobius" and
other forms—-we’ll rather take ice
cream and drop “Le docteur."

director of the Harvard College Ob-

Petition Accepted

The petition presented to the na-
tional oﬂices of the hono ary sci-
ence fraternity by the loci‘
Xi Club last March was acc d
together with that of Harvard ni-
versity. The petition was-presented
in the form of a book and included
the Petition Proper, the Letters of
Endorsement, the Records of the Pe-

the
Research Facilities of the Univer-

city.

The men listed as members of the
local chapter of Sigma’ Xi have
been selected because of unusual
achievements in the ﬁeld of science.
Outstanding‘ ﬁgures in Astronomy,
Botany, Chemistry, Engineering,
Geology, Mathematics, Medicine,
Physics, Zoology and Psychology are
chosen as members of the frater-

nity.

“I believe that the installation of
this -chaptypr is one of the greatest
events in ‘University history,“ said
Dr. R. T. Hance. “Since scientiﬁc
achievement is the only recommen-
dation for membership it is easily
seen that the standing of our fra-
ternity scholastically is a lofty one.
Together with Phi Beta Kap a it
stands at the zenith, of echo tic
achievement. The unusual fact that
Dr. Clapp. a University trustee, has
been given such great honor makes
our installation ceremonies out-
standing. It is a rarepinstance that
University trustees are such unu-
sual authorities on scientiﬁc subjects
as is Dr. Clapp. We are very proud
of the fact that we have been ac-
cepted as a chapter in the national
chain of Sigma Xi.”

 

University Women.

sity, together with their families and
friends, are invited to attend the an-
nual bridge to be given a week from

Roles In Play

Present “Captain Applejack”
At Y. M. H. A. Feb. 19

“Captain Applejack” has made
both the technical staff of Pitt Play-
ers and the cast change their minds
several times.

Clarence Sober, Dent. ’32, in the
ﬁrst act is a quiet, unassuming
country gentleman; in the second
act, he becomes a blustering, bellig-
erant pirate captain.

The technical ‘staff has two sets
to make for the production. One is
the digniﬁed, stolid living room of
John Applejohn, country gentleman.
The other set is the mess hall of
the pirate ship. Through the open
hatchway the audience will see a
blue sky cut by the halyards pass-
ing from the deck to the mast.

This set will be intentionally
crude to supply the necessary “at-
mosphere” of suspense and adven-
ture. N. Robert Seidle, Eng. '31, is
technical manager of the Players.

Barbara Ann Hartman plays the
two-sided role of the captive Por-
tuguese Woman in the second act,
and of the crock who plays up to
quiet John Applejohn.

Those who saw “The Whiteheaded
Boy” may expect to see a more ﬁn-
ished production, a more elaborate

An Iustry’s Program

That Made Front-Page News

Cloth rolling off the looms . .- . thousands of yards . . . mil-
lions of yards . . . pouring into an already glutted market;
Women and children working throughlthe long night hours
to produce more goods where less was needed.

From competitive chaos in the textile industry order and
straight thinking have suddenly" emerged. Through The
Cotton-Textile Institute, an agency of the industry’: own -
creation, the end of night work for women and minors has
been decreed.

This single step projects on the horizon the following bene-

_ fits: (1) Full time for the day worker‘ instead of part time for
him and the night worker; (2) more orderly production;
(3) better working conditions; (4) more profitable opera-
tion; (S) better returns for mill and worker.

No wonder textile markets are stronger! No wonder the
textile industry is raising its head and its good news is
making the front pages!

Underneath all this new progress there will be found, as
usual, ,2. McGraw-Hill publication. Textile World long ago
urged the abolition of night work for women and minors as
one step‘ in a program to restore prosperity to textile mills
and employees. It has labored side by side with the industry
for the achievement of that program. '

So in many industries, today, you’ll find a McGrs,w-Hill
Publication sponsoring progressive thought and action. If
' you keep abreast of the day-by-day achievements of the field
you expect to enter, read the McGraw-Hill paper covering
that field. Most college libraries have, or should have,
McGraw-Hill Publications. Ask your librarian.

lVhy Not Professional?

HERE IS GENERAL APPROVAL in Pitts-
burgh that the action of the Athletic
Council this week in cuttingthe fall condition-
ing period for the football squad was not more
drastic. If the Athletic Council had announced
sweeping changes in the intercollegiate sport
program, including elimination of spring train-
ing, ‘smaller football squads, a less attractive
schedule and fewer games, a howl of protest
would probably have arisen from all sides.
Where they are passively accepted, such
changes must be regarded as a response to dis-
content occasioned by a none too successful
athletic program in the past few-years. At
Pitt, where athletic teamsare put on a winning
basis, there is little clamor for change. i
The tremendous investments made forstadia
and equipment, the increasing number of inter-
sectional games, a high-salaried coaching staff

and; concessions made to varsity players,’ all

indicatetliat college football has
fessional in spiritif not in letter. . .

Yet students and the general -public have
come to demand football on a big scale ;,that is.
students in those, institutions which boast of
athletic success. Those interested" in these
schools want spectacular games and winning
teams. Itis probably unfortunate that the col-
leges have encouraged this demand,.but now so
long as -_it is the generally accepted view, it
would seem desirable to conduct college foot-
ball in the professional manner. There should
be nooattenipt to cover up Vpiofessional tactics,
b.ut'the entire system of intercollegiate football
programs should be brought to light, as is the
case in other prCf€SSlOI1al‘Sp0Z'i}S.

’No matter how many changes are made in
the athleticcouncil, the size of football squads

“New nii_d-semester freshmen are

and others are essential factors in
the new stiidents’ life at college.”

_Mr. Mendenhall cited the ‘exten-
sive work accompiished by the Pit’;-
more and the Horizon Clubs during
the first'semes’;er of the college
year. The joint social activity wi.'h

' the members of the girls’ “Why”

club was cited as an outstanding
achievement. Club discussions, so-
cial contacts and the prevalence of
an atmosphere of comradeship are
the fundamental contributions of
freshman clubs. ,
’ - One hundred twenty-ﬁve Y. M. C.

xtshman groups at their luncheon
last Tuesday at the University

freshman to return the cardswhich

would indicate their interests in the"

“Y” activities. .

The Pittmore and Horizon Clubs
were organized last fall a"; the sug-
gestion of Mr. Mendenhall and have
been active in freshman activities
during the semester. The Horizon
Club, which meets during the third

‘The Pitt varsity cagers won their
ﬁfth ‘and sixth consecutive games as
well as their eleventh and twelfth
triumphs of the season when they
scored victories over Notre Dame at
Sou‘ Bend and Was-hinvgton and
Jefferson at little Washington-"dun
ing the past two weeks.

Both games proved harder for the
Pitt passers than they had antici-
pated, and last minute rallies were
staged by the Panthers before they
cinched both tilts.

The Irish passers kept close to the
heels of the Panthers throughout
their engagement, and the regular
playing time ended with the two
teams tied at 20 points. Willie Ar-
ture ran wild in the extra period to
score three ﬁeld goals; a.nd with Doc
Kowallies scoring one, the Panthers
emerged victorious, 28-20.

Carlson Absent

In the game with the Presidents,
the Panthers played without the
guidance of Coach Carlson who was
unable to attend the fray due to eye-
trouble.
_ The Pi1'.t_.playe.rs.evider_itly missed
their coach, for only : last minute
rally enabled the Panthers to eke
out a three point triumph over a
team which has a none too impres-
sive record thus far this year.

Pitt led the home team 16-8 at
the half. The Presidents rallied
to bring the count to 16-15, and then
the Panthers spurted to lead 26-15.
The Prexies again pulled up and
ﬁnally knotted the count at 26
points with but a minute to play. A
ﬁeld goal and a foul sewedthe game

Basketball League of the_ Depart-
ment of Education. By winning two
games by forfeiture during the
week of January 27, they were able
to keep their slate clean _ and to
maintain a record which no? other
team is able to equal. . I

The week of January 27 consisted
entirely of forfeitures despite the
fact that nine games had been
scheduled for play. The Glassos
were most fortunate, gaining credit
for three victories, all by the usual
forfeiture score of 2 to 0. The Hot
Dogs and the Alperts also took ad-.
vantage of the non-appearance of
their opponents, and each of these
teams copped two wins.

Few Games This Week

There will be but one night of
competition during this next week,
Wednesday being the only evening
on which playing is scheduled. The
Arrigos will play the Unknowns, the
Bleans will oppose the All-Stars, and
the “400” team will meet the Hot
Dogs.

The standing of the teams at the
end of the week of January 27 was

Men .In Morgantown Meet

Final practice and time trials for
the Panther track and ﬁeld team
which will compete in the third an-
nual West Virginia Indoor Games,
at Morgantown next Saturday, are
scheduled throughout. the coming
week in the track house. The twen-
ty-three varsity men and seven
yearlings whom Coach Frank J .
Shea has entered in the fourteen
events at the Morgantown meet will
undergo eliminations until the twen-
ty who will make the trip have been
deﬁnitely chosen.

In the eleven events carded for
colleges and universities, Pitt looks
strongest in the seventy-yard dash,
the broad and high jumps, the
sprint and 4-5-mile relays and the
mile and half-mile runs.

Coach Shea has Harris, Miller,
V itulla and Monheim to choose from
for the classic seventy, Woody and
Bill looking best at present. Wat-
kins, Clise and Caeser in the dis-
tance runs are running well enough
to cop a few places, while Utter-
back is almost a sure bet to take
ﬁrsts in the two jumps. The Pan-‘
ther entrants in the sprint will com-

pose the 2-5 and 4-5—mile relay
teams, being augmented by Jim
Watkins in the longer relay.

Competition is also scheduled for
seventy-yard high and low hurdles,
in which Pitt will rely upon Utter-
back, Lewis and Thiessen. The pole
vault will again see Utterback in
the running, his mates here being
Connell and McConnell.

In the last event on the program.
the sixteen—pound shotput, Luch,
second string fullback; Fats Wal-
ton, Jim McMurdo, varsity end, and
Carver are entered.

Freshman entrants who have been

'WiIl Offer Make-up Test In
Modern Languages

 

The Freshman Week now a thing
of thepast, the class of February,
1935, has already entered into the
routine of class attendance and Uni-

versity life. Approximately 125
freshmen took part in the Freshman
Week program, and John G. Quick,
Registrar, expects about 25 students
to be added to this group through
late registration.

A change in the program at the
last minute eliminated all place-
ment tests except that in Modern
Languages. Placement tests had
been scheduled for the incoming stu-
dents that were to include Science,
English, and Psychology. These were
dropped from the list of required
examinations because of the lack of
time in the crowded program of
events.

All those students who failed to
be present when the placement test
in Modern Languages was given will
be required to take that examination‘
next Wednesday, from 5 to 7 p. m.,
in Room 315,-Alumni Hall.

During the four days that pre-
ceded the opening of second semes-
ter classes yesterday, the commit-
tee in charge of Freshman Week
vents attempted to make the re-
quired examinations and conferences
seem as pleasant as possible by in-
troducing various entertainment fea-
tures. The freshmen were conducted
through the Cathedral of Learning
and treated to a view of the campus
and vicinity from the top floor of
the new building. This trip, together
with several luncheons and interest-
ing conferences with upperclassmen
advisers, helped to relieve the strain
of registration and compulsory ex-
aminations. ’ -' V

Mahony Is Alpha
 Kappa Psi Speaker

 

J. Lloyd Mahoney, instructor in
Finance in the School of Business
Administration, was the,speaker at
the regular weekly luncheon of Al-
-pha Kappa Psi, professional business
fraternity, held last Tuesday at the
Hotel Roosevelt.

_Hisv subject was “Financing a
Business: In Its Beginning.” In his
talk, Mr. Mahoney concerned himself
with the various problems that con-
front the man who is trying to build
up a new business organization. He
considered the ﬁnancial advantages

tions, and traced the steps from the
discovery or invention of the prod-
uct to the actual operation of the
growing concern.

The part played by promotion
campaigns and the promoter himself
in stabilizing the new concern was
-also discussed. Securities and the
best method of handling their sale
and distribution were discussed at
length. ,

The next meeting of the frater-
nity will be held in the banquet hall
of the Hotel Roosevelt, Tuesday’,
February 10, at 12:15 p. m. At that
time Mr. Mahoney will discuss an-
-other phase of the ﬁnance problem,

Seminar Gets lIVoodbridgei

Lecture By ‘Columbia Professor «Combines
“Psychology and Physics”

The Social Science Seminar will have as its guest on Friday, Febru-
ary 13, Dr. F. J. E. Woodbridge, Johnsonian professor of Philosophy at

Columbia University.

The meeting is scheduled to take place at the University Club and
will be preceded by a luncheon at 12:30 o’clock. The subject of the address

will be “Psychology and Physics.”

Professor Woodbridge was for, many years dean of the graduate

faculties of Columbia University, ax?

position from which he resigned in
1929 in order to devote his full time
to teaching and research. The chair
which he occupies in the depart-
ment of philosophy is named after
Samuel Johnson, the ﬁrst president
and professor of philosophy of Co-
lumbia University, then .known as

‘King's College.

As editor of the Journal of Phi-
losophy, one of the most outstanding
philosophical periodicals, Professor
Woodbridge is making his inﬂuence
felt in a large way on the philo-
sophical thinking of the day._

Because of his recognized ability
as an orator, the services of Profes-
sor Woodbridge have been much in

demand at the most varied occasions.
His main writings include: “The Son
of Apollo,” the .most genial treat-
ment ever written of themes of
Plato, as well as “The Realm ‘of
Mind” and “The Purpose of HIS-
tory,” important essays in meta-
physics. ’ _

The reputation which Professor
Woodbridge has achieved as a schol-
ar is guarantee that his appearance
before the Social Science Seminar
will constitute one of the most im-
portant events in the series of stim-
ulating lectures arranged by that
body. Interested members of the
faculty are cordially invited to at-
tend.

Picks Senior
Invite Group

5 e v e n Prominent Students
Placed on Committee

Members of the senior announce-
ments committee have been picked
by Isadore M. Kreimer, Dent. '31,
council’s -recently appointed chair-
man. The committee is composed of
on the
campus, and are as fol-lows:

Betty Knapp and Ben Sufrine,
College; Russell Braund, Bus. Ad.;
Franklin Felker, En-g.; Bernadette
Connelly, Ed.; J. F. McDonald, Med.,
and Byron Baur, Law. _ ‘

The committee met early this
week and made its selection from
samples shown by various ﬁrms. B.
K. Elliott received the contract for
the announcements and will have

samples ready for exhibition on the
campus in several weeks.

Select Leather

At another meeting the commit-
tee selected the leather and its col-
or. The color scheme will probably
be a cathedral design with a deep
gold background placed on a dark-
blue grained leather. A definite, de-
cision concerning the scheme will be
made at the next meeting.

A novel plan of diistributio-n of the
announcements is to made, accord-
ing to the chairman. A concentrated
campaign, with the slogan “an-
nounce your graduation,” will be
held in the near future.

New engraving and printing proc-
esses will be introduced into this
year’s announcements. The idea is
dignity and simplicity. The date set
for the campaign is probably about
April 1.

Robinson Crusoe fame, was once a
