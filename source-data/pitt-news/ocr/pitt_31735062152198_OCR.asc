First 'tan'gible.' evi'deiice of a divi-‘. A-__

sion of opinion on”ca‘rnpus co"ncern-_..
ing The Owl beauty contest was
made public yesterday when‘ S'tanley
Rogaliner, BA37, editor of. The Owl,
gave, a_ News reporter ..a letter. from;
WSGA President ',‘3~?Lois' _ ._ Follansbee
containing a motion‘ passed-'.by’ the
executive comrnittee of the_Wom_en’s
Sself Government Association; _*-f A
The executive ‘_"com_mittee 7 went"'o___n
record as “unanimously--disapproving
all beauty contests because such con-
tests are u-ndigniﬁed, commercial, "and,
unseemly exploitations, "of women,‘
and requests that the, Publications
Board and the editor ;of The Owl‘
wi'thdravv’_. .the present contest.” "C
In reply't_o. Miss‘Fo1lansbee, Roga'_.-
liner says: “.We__. sincerely ‘believe
that The Owl _.be'auty_* .coili‘te_':st.'-“'fis-._,a.
deﬁnite asset _to' .tli_e‘_.bodk."3‘_"It_fivaS
not the intention“ of '1‘1ief'0w1 to
cause confusion” and‘ "‘u"ﬁfavorable
comment by introducing ‘this contest
and it is with much regret that we
ﬁnd ourselves p1'oje.ct,ed into the cen-
ter of such 11eedle'ss'-'-‘fra’y -by your ‘ex-
ccutive com1nittee’s action.” _ '
Other Considerations 3-.
He says: “lt appears that the lead-
ers of your organization have over-
looked a few salient points in con-
deming our plans for a beauty sec-
tion. They have certainly failed to
consider that they as a body have
criticized by their action some of the
leading universities in the country,
equally as ‘digniﬁed’ as our ow1'1+‘-?Min~-
nesota, Southern California,- Ohio
State, Carnegie Tech, to men but a
few.” __
“ ‘Undigniﬁed’ ‘assumes that such a.’
contest is without5 ‘any qualities suit-
ed to inspire or command’ respect,”-'

Rogaliner states, _and ‘ contends. that.-

the contest will be__‘,1*u11,'fairly (he
offers The Owl records before‘ and‘
after the contest) and judged by a
recognized au'tho,rit'y:,‘.‘is designedprto
inspire conﬁdence in-fiithosef-carrying
out the deﬁned rules. Certainly ~‘con-"
ﬁdence’ is an element of respect.”

Womelfs Fraternities

Plan Rushing Affairs

Panhellenic "Council Ruling
Makes First-Semester
Women Ineligible

 

When fraternity women get busy
planning affairs and freshmen buzz
about expected invitations, it is quite
evident that spring rushing 59350“
is near.

Under the system of deferred
rushing in practice at the University,
women who entered last September
are not eligible for rushing-until the
second semester. The deferred rush-
ing plan was established by Panhel-
lenic Council 12 years ago. It places
the ﬁrst emphasis on grades and rele-
gates social .-life to a secondary
position:

Protect: Fraternities

This system digniﬁes the individual
fraternity by furnishing 311 0131301‘-
;tunity to base invitations to member-
ship on real acquaintance or friend-
ship, rather _than .on ﬁrst appear-
ances; by safeguarding the frater-
nities from having pledges who can-
not be initiated because of low
grades; and by relieving the frater-
nity each year of a number of im-
mature freshmen unoriented to uni-
versity life in general, ‘thus giving
the fraternity an opportunity" to de-
velop more effectively for upper-
class women the real values of the
fraternity. V

Past experience has taught the

council that when freshmen are se- -

lected in‘ the ﬁrst semester, each fra-
ternity has had to spend an undue
amount of time each year in orienta-
tion problems. By making’ member-
ship in a fraternity something to be
achieved through the -test of in_tel-

—-electual ability and the observation

for the individual’s social worth over
a period of time, the plan helps the
fraternity group.
Gives Freshman A Chance”

The individual freshman is pro-
tected by "the-plan of putting ﬁrst
things ﬁrst, and the pro-of that she, is

‘ capable of doing Unive.rsity work. By

giving her an opportunity to know
the University as a whole, to become
somewhat oriented to it before focus-

_ ing attention upon a small group; by

giving __her a chance to have wide
knowledge of fraternities, the Coun-
C11 insures intelligent choice. The

~ student getsa real appreciation of a

f1_*aternity_ as agoal rather than as a
gift pronnscuously distributed. A

Miracles Do Happen
T-HEY HAD a big pep meeting
up on the. Hilltop Tuesday
past. It seems there was to be
some sort of a ball game the fol-
lowing evening, scheduled for
the Pitt Stadium. The cheer-
leaders worked overtime. The
men- of honor promised. Every-__
one was determined.
Meanwhile, on alinear-by cam-
pus, things were moving‘ along
normally. Oh, most people knew
there was to. be some sort of a
get-together on Wednesday eve-
ning. But they weren’t particu-
larly disturbed. You see‘ this

an overdose of Rose fever, and
the papers said it_ was to get
colder, anyhow. ' ‘ »

There was a small group, how-
ever, strenuously at work. Physi-
cally, they, too, looked normal.
But they were doing a bit of re-
viewing. The story goes that
they were doingha bit of mem-
ory worlri "Twice in several
years “past they had been able

 'I'n youreditorial," “His Latest Mes-

The News said: .-.

The editorial to whicl1....Mr.-

editorial in question erred on
some points. It failed to add
that we believe that ‘the funda-
mental issue behind the Presi-
dent’s move was that he merely
wished to “threaten.’.’_ the Su-
preme Court into- reporting fa-
vorably on the Wagner Labor Re-
lations Act which was up before
the Court on Monday following
the deliverance of the message.
If the Court does not declare the
Act unconstitutional there is
much reason to believe that the
campaign for revising lhe Court
system will lose some of its
steam. ’ ~ ‘
We believe that Mr. Marshall-
also missed a few points. Dis-_
counting the above opinion, if"
he must, perhaps Mr. Marshall
will recognize that this move was
a subtle and statesman-_like__‘,‘_in-_
vitation” to the members -‘of tlié

constitutional limitations. That
is, it is entirely out of the ques-
tion for the President toask for

Editor‘, The Pitt News:

I write this in appreciation of the
fact that The Pitt. News had “news,"
fresh news, in its Wednesday edition.
I hope that the rest of the student
body was aware that the report on
the SF.A‘,meeti_ng was not yet L2
hours _o1d”when it made its appear-
ance on campus-for first ho-u-r classes.
It’s too bad tl1a't'we often have to
wait for Friday and Monday for
things that occur on Tuesday ..anl'l
Thursday, respectively, after the‘
event has lost its news value and ap-
peal. Such an edition as Wednes-
day's’ points definitely to the fact
that’it is possible for the Universiti‘
of Pittsburgh to have a daily cani-
pus newspaper. We should have
one. The volume of advei-tising is
large enough to make it a ﬁnancial
possibility-'.~ An organization could
easily be developed so that the editor
could leave the ‘print-a1*‘s before 3
o’clock in the morning._ Mr. Editor,
I. think the campus appreciates its
News served hot off the press.

-- reference to the above, we
do appreciate the writer’s senti-
ments. If in turning out an is-
sue of The News, one person"
recognizes some small effort on
our part to improve The News.
then we feel that we have done
something worthy of the effort.

As to the suggestion of a daily
newspaper, we believe attention
should be directed at the busi-
ness staif. It best knows the
possibilities of such an expan-

nesday evening they were thor-
oughly outclasscd during the
first period of play. The Dukes

--had doubled the score on them.

Everyone by this time knows
what happened in that second
period, and how Garcia plopped
one in with only seconds to go.

The most remarkal:ilc- point to;

the story is that V.’cdn(‘-sday
nights’ performance was not the

—first of its kind for Dr. Carl:-:ou’s

winning warriors. They did it
against Notre Dame, .a team
without a peer and few equals

in the rnid-West. They did it
against Westminster and Tem-
ple, and Tech, and others. They
won with little more than their
own will to win. But that was
plenty. They had no pep assem-
blies. few slaps on the back, and
only passive fans behind them.

This 1.937 cage squad will
ihzzrrlly go down as the best one
in history, but it will be known
as one of the ﬁghtingist, never-
lto-be-counted-out athletic teams
ito play on a Pitt basketball
‘court.

JUST a week ago today President
Roosevelt. launched the ﬁrsl; of the
long expected thu11de1‘boli.s at the
venerable U. 8. Supreme Court. The
Old Guard, of course, raised their
hands in Holy Horror at the proposal,
declaimed tltat it pulled the founda-
tions from under the “American
:-‘y.-:Len'1” and that it shook the Tem-
ple of Liberty, tlireateiiing to bring
that ediﬁce crashing about our ears.
No one who has read the news-
papers consist-entvly will pay much
heed to this sort of twaddle. In the
undercover bickering that has been
going on between the judiciary and
the other two b1'zmche:5 this form of
dia.lc-ctic has been trotted out to wag
its tail in each and every constitu-
tional breeze. Its only excuse is as
a rabble l'0llSll1g device, but the 1'ah~
ble has already been roused--by the
ot-licr side.

Cour! Will Always Be Conservative

IKE a balloon in the wind the size

bf the Supreme Court has gone
up or down  the political monsoons
dictated. And ZI.l'l'.l10l1gl1 at a particu-
lar time the number of justices sit-
ting on the bench may be of tactical
advantage--as is the situation at the
present -time--i't is in the long run
i1*1'elcvant. The Court has been, is,
and probably ever will be c0n.<e1'\'a-
tive, if not precisely 1‘cact.ionary.
Thus there is no rezuson to believe
that by siinply iiicreasing the mem-
bership of the Court that it will per-
n1a.nen‘t1y cliange its leopard-lilrc
spots. Until the powcr of judicial
review is liainpercd, or taken away

Incidentally, the proposal may have
an effect. not calculated by its spon-
sors. The Court, by the addition of
judges of varying degrees of liberal-
ism, may emerge with the major part
of its prestige, especially if proper
gratitude is shown by the new ap-
pointees in placing the Courts im-
primateur on certain pending legis-
lation. The electorate by reason of
the strange hocus pocus that takes
place in its mind may consider that
the august body has undergone a
metamorphosis and that it has burst
forth from its cocoon as a full-ﬂedged

your attentioii.

have tread the path of adversity to-
gether in spirit for mam‘ years now,
so I feel that I am not being pre-
sumptious in calling upon you in this
_.e-inergency.

For many years now, I have fol-
lowed your career with, I might say,
avid interest, in that you and I have
can a.lI‘llllt_V. I, you see, am a student
of political science at the University
of Pittsburgli, and that just about
makes us'”—eve"n.

Now, the matter I wish to broacl‘.
to you is of such import that instead
of rushing headlong into an outright
petitio principii, I am constrained to
circumvent the banalities of _vommon-
place requests. This favor, Congress-
man Schultz, lies so near to my
heart that I_ could never reduce it
l3h1‘0Uf§h 10086 employment of casual
words, to the bourgeois.

This matter, then, I will call for
the Present, The Patronage. What do
I mean by a patronage?

YOU. have been a legis.1ato"1' for year

all for the state; you, who have been

monwealth and a boon to mankind in
