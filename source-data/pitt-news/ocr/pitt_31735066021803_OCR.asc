SGB to implement free legal
consultation service toistudents «

By Teresa. Candorit
News Editor

The Student Government
Board has undertaken a legal
consultation program whereby
students can receive free legal ad-
vice from an attorney, SGB Presi-
dent Phil Moyerrreported at last
night's meeting.

According to Moyer, students
who-have problems with their
landlords or the university, or
similar problems will be able to
consult with a lawyer in the SGB
office free of charge. Similar con-
sultations can cost up to $75 per
hour, Moyer said.

Liberace, the ‘audience-
dazzling pianist famous for his
flamboyant costumes and flashy
jewelry, died Wednesday in Palm
Springs, Calif., of anemia, em-
physema and heart disease. L

Prior to his death, Liberace
played concert halls coast-to-
coast, entertaining fans with both
his music and personality. Au-
diences came to love the pianist’s
stage style which earned him the

title ”Mr. Showmanship.” The A

offered his services to the univer-
sity for half his normal fee. The
cost will be undertaken by the
SGB, according to Moyer. Gal-
zer_ano could not be reached for
comment.

The board also approved three
travel requests from student or-
ganizations and denied one pro-
gram request.

, A $2,310 request from the
Black Action Society to fund a
Black History Month speaker, Dr.
Yosef Ben—Jochanin, was denied
on the grounds that sufficient

' funds had already been spent on

Black History Month.
Allocations Committee chair-
person Karen Bohichik said that

Candelabras that adorned his pi-
ano quickly became Liberace’s
trademark.

It was his exotic style that
helped create Liberace’s relation-
ship with St. Francis Medical
Center. According to Shirley
Freyer, director of Public Affairs
for SFMC, it waswhile Liberace
was trying to clean a costume for
an appearance atthe Holiday
House in Monroeville that the en-

tertainer- inhaled fumes from a
‘cleaning fluid. '

”He was diagnosed as having
uremic poisoning,” said Freyer.

$13,000 had already been allo-
cated to Black History Month.
However,’ Tony Baldwin of the
BAS disputed Bohichik’s claim,
and said he believed the figure
was closer to $7,000.

Upon inspection of the formal
budget, Bohichik found the figure
to be approximately $10,000.

Baldwin-protested the Alloca-

' tions Committee's recommenda-

tion, saying, ”B|ack students
don't have very many "outlets,
and we [BAS] are their outlet 
l don't think the needs ofthe
black students are being met.”

shooting disputed

By Mohammed Salam

Associated Press Writer

S BlElRUT, Lebanon — Two taxi ‘

drivers said they saw missing
hostage negotiator Terry Waite
walking in a southern Beirut
suburb yesterday with an escort
of about 10 gunmen -and four tur-
baned Shiite Moslem, sheiks.
Waite, the 6-7 Anglican
Church envoy, was last seen by
reporters Jan. 20when he left the
Riviera Hotel in west Beirut to

' meet the kidnappers of two

Americans. Since then, Waite has
not contacted the church or his
family. . _

Waite’s prolonged absence has
triggered a flurry of reports about
his fate. The latest report came
from the West German Bild
Zeitung newspaper, which quot-
ed unnamed ”Beirut security
sources” as saying Waite was
shot and critically wounded after

he tried to escape from captivity. ,

Bild, a Hamburg-based mass-

circulation newspaper, did not_

say when or where the alleged
shooting occurred. It provided no
further details.

The taxi drivers, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, told The
Associated Press they saw Waite
walking with his escorts in a
street close, to the Lebanese cap-
ital's airport highway at about 3
p.m. Thursday. _

’’I saw him smiling-and waving
his hand to onlookers as he
walked. He wore a gray rain-
coat," said one »witness. ’’I
stopped my taxicab to watch, but
the escorts waved me away,
shouting: ‘Don't stop. Drive on.’
I did." L

Waite wore a raincoat when he
was last seen by reporters.

Waite came to Beirut to try to

‘adopted him, and he adopted
us,” said Sister Adele.

The relationship between the
two became so strong that Liber-
ace made large contributions to
St. Francis, and the medical

center named a lobby after.hi~m. '

Liberace came to Pittsburgh in
June to atte_nd the ribbon-cutting
ceremony at St. Francis’s new
lobby.

Sister Adele said she is still hop-
ing for a piano and candelabra to
adorn the Liberace Lobby, but the
funds have yet to materialize.

American journalist Seib reportedly out of Iran

NICOSIA, Cyprus -— Airport

officials in Tehran said early Fri- »

day that American journalist Ger-
ald F. Seib had left the Iranian
capital en route to West
Germany.

Seib, a 30-year-old Cairo-based
correspondent for the Wall Street
Journal, was arrested during a
government-sponsored press tour
and had been accused of spying.

Officials at the Tehran airport
told The Associated Press in a tel-
ephone interview from Nicosia
that Seib was aboard Lufthansa
airline Flight 601 that left the air-
port at about 6 a.m. (9:30 p.m.
EST Thursday).

They said the plane would
make a brief stop in the southern
Iranian city of Bander Abbas be-
fore continuing on to West Ger-
many.

In Ottawa, Canada's Foreign
office said it had been advised
that Philip Engs, a Canadian en-
gineer arrested Dec. 2 on espi-
onage charges, also would be
”released soon.” An American
telecommunications specialist
and a British businessman also

are imprisoned in Iran on similar
charges.

Seib was in a group of 57 for-
-eign journalists invited to visit the
southern front in the 6-year-old
war with Iraq.

An official of Iran's Information
Ministry, reached by telephone in
Tehran on Thursday, had said of
Seib: ”He has still not left, but
will leave within the next 24
hours.” «

PHILADELPHIA —- A union
gift-giving scandal and other

The suspension of 15 judges
this week during a probe of cash

’’I take this action because the

ference.

There are 85 state court of
Common Pleas judgeships in
Philadelphia, along with 22 in
municipal court. Of those 107

Generations Together bridging the distance  

By Lisa Hallman
For The Pitt News

The elderly and the young. So-

ciety has stereotypes for each
group which often results in bar-
riers betweengthe two, inhibiting
interaction. Breaking down these
barriers allows for the develop-
ment of valuable friendships.
Such is the function of Gener-
ations Together/Youth in Service
to Elders, located on the eighth
floor of the Cathedral of Learning.
Youth in Service to Elders is an
intergenerational ' program that

provides opportunities for stu-

dents to develop meaningful rela-
tionships with older people.
”The research that we have
done has proven that this is mutu-
ally beneficial to the older peo-
ple and to the younger people,”

said Kris Knouff, assistant coordi-

nator of YISTE. ’

According to Knouff, about 200
students and 500 elders are in-
volved in the program. Ninety
percent of the studerts are from
Pittsburgh area high schools.
Knouff said the reason for the
high number of high school stu-
dents is that they have more time
to volunteer than college
students. '

Most students are involved in
the program because they want
to provide community service.

”|t’s to give something of them-
selves to provide community sup-
port, but they are looking for
friendship and companionship
with an older person, too,”
Knouff said.

THE PITT NEws, Friday, February 6, I987)

Luzie Goldman (left) and Kim Blair

Many of the elders are involved
because ”they’re looking for so-
cialization, someone ’ to take
away their loneliness, give them
something to look forward to.
The older people feel that they
are more involved in what goes
on around them,” Knouff said.

Many friendships have deve-
loped because of YISTE. One of
those is between Kim Blair, a Pitt
nursing student, and Luzie Gold-
man, an elderly Squirrel Hill
resident.

Blair, 22, has been visiting
Goldman since the fall of 1984.
She said she became interested in

‘ Generations—Together/YISTE be-

cause she wanted to become
more involved in the campus, but
as soonas she met Goldman her
reasons changed.

’’If it was purely for the sake of
getting it on my transcript I would

have stopped doing it a long time
ago. I feel like I would be letting
a friend down if I just stopped
visiting,” Blair said.

”The whole program is an en-
richment to my life,’’ Goldman
said. When Goldman, 88, was
younger, she spent a lot of her
time volunteering in old age
homes, reading to blind people
and delivering Meals—on—Wheels.

She had a stroke several years
ago and had to give‘ up her volun-
teer work. .. ‘

”This brings fresh life to me
and shows me how much the

world has changed. It is another

way of showing me things when
I heartwhat she's [Blair] doing and
what her plans are. It brings
memories back to me. It makes
me talk with her about things that
I sometimes try to forget,” Gold-
man said. .

 Scott CornoheNws

Goldman left her native Ger-
many in ‘I940 with her husband
and two daughters. She has given
Blair a new perspective of older
people and of life. '

”I never really had a relation-
ship with somebody where I
could see them not as the physi-
cal self, but Icould see her for the
things that are like me or the ad-
venture of the things that I like to
do,” Blair said. ”It’s more [like]
treating an older person not for
the sake of them being older, but
as an equal. '

-”Older people are people with
pasts and stories, and [they] have
gone through the same things that
I'm going through now, even
though it was 50 years ago,” Blair
said. ‘ ’

Goldman does meet with other
people during the week. She has

a daughter living in Pittsburgh,
and she is close to the neighbors
in her apartment building. Her
meals are delivered everyday by

Meals-on-Wheels. She laughs that '
she is now at the other end of the V

program. —.
When Blair and Goldman visit
each week, they spend about two

hours together.They usually talk I

or play scrabble, and sometimes
they go out to dinner. Most of

their time is spent just enjoying K ‘ I

each‘ others’ company.
Blair will be graduating from

Pitt this spring, but she and Gold- '

man plan to keep in touch. Gold-

man's eyes filled with tears when .

she spoke of Blair's leaving.
Most of the ‘reactions to the

YISTE program have been favora-

ble. Knouff said 95 percent of the

elders continue in the program .

and 60 percent of the students
participate more than six months.

Research has shown the pro-

gram to be very successful. .

Knouff said, ”It raises their [the
elders] self esteem, provides them
with’ new friends and social con-
tacts, restores their confidence

and allows them to share the spe- '

cial talents that they have.
”It broadens their [the student

volunteers] view of life and the ’

aging process, instills a sense of
responsibility, and they develop
a tolerance for differences.”

Goldman said, ”It is an enrich-
ment for me, and I think it will be

for every senior person who has

no other way of being with young

- people.”

Campus housing
could be better

The problems that face any university are many, and the
problems that face this university are well chronicled. One is
the yearly winter circus in the Towers lobby — otherwise
referred to as the housing lottery.

Annually, students who had planned to spend the following

year in the university residence halls find themselves-in a A

predicament. They draw a bad number in the housing lottery.
Usually the student is left with two options:

1. The student can have his/her name placed on the wait-
ing list and wait until around August before he/she officially
receives housing — probably with an incoming freshman in
the Towers.

‘ 2. The student can look outside of the university for hous-

‘ ing,”su'ch as one of the apartments owned by Oakland slum-

lords. Usually the apartments are lousy, the rent is astronomical,
and the area is unsafe.
it What is the answer?
There is none it seems.
The university seems content with the housing lottery, prob-
ably because it is convenient for the ‘university.
It is not convenient for the students. It is unfair to most.
Something has to be done — soon.

Some officials are
simply incapable

Last week, Robert Gates was installed as the new head of
the CIA, and a welcome change it could be. Gates is roughly
a generation younger than the out—going director, William
Casey. With any luck, we will see a new generation of leader-
ship in what many consider one of the most powerful arms of
the govenment.

In the latter part of his career, Casey was responsible, at least

by the grace of his office, for some of the most serious mis-
takes in recent U.S. history. _
Misinformation to Lybia, arms to Iran, money to the Contras.
His record is a long one scarred by inexcusable breaches in
public trust. He, with another senior member of the adminis-
tration, well, ah, I think you know who, has violated the Ameri-
can people. We cannot and should not stand for such‘ abuse
of power in what is nominally the best place in the world to live.
There is a line between secrecy that is necessary for the secu-
rity of the nation and secrecy for the political security of the
staff members. Casey and, by implication, Reagan, have crossed
over that line. It is time to bring the government out of the
movie-house mentality and into the harsh, cold light of reality.
A reality in which the elected and appointed public officials
may not operate on the fringes of the law forthe advancement
of programs not endorsed by the majority of the administration.
We are supposedly a people governed by the majority. Of
course, when we elect an official, we give that official the right
to make decisions for us, but those decisions should at the very
least not run directly counter to the will of the population.
Casey and Reagan have not upheld the trust placed in them
and should not be permitted to remain on the path they have
chosen for themselves. I T -

Casey's resignation was long overdue, and his is not the only .

one.

Speed limit laws archaic  

”It is not just a good idea, it's
the law.”

That was how the 55 miles-per-
hour speed limit was promoted in
the 19705.

It is no longer a good idea. As
a matter of fact, it is now a lousy
idea — but it is still the law.

Finally, debate has begun in
the lawmaking bodies as to
whether or not the speed limit
should remain as is.

I say no.

The idea, which passed
through the Senateon Wednes-
day, is to raise the limit to 65 mph
on rural highways. Bravo.

One the original arguments be-
hind the reduction of the speed
limit to 55 was that there was an
energy crisis. i

That excuse is no longer

-kosher.

”55 saves lives.”
No it doesn't.

. JIM URBAN

Not many people actually drive
55 mph because the law is not
enforced. It-seems that the safe
speed to drive nowadays is 62

‘mph. It is faster than the legal

limit, yet it is usually not high
enough to get you pulled over for
speeding.

Everytimell make my way

down one of the expressways that e

spans this commonwealth, I can
tell those who actually drive 55
mph. They are the ones being
passed by the rest of us who are
going 62 mph.

Raise the speed limit to 65mph
on selective highways, and en-
force it. Don't wait until someone
comes by driving 73 or 75 mph

The Students‘ for a Free South
Africa must express disappoint-
ment with the article in The Pitt
News on our educational series
and the .recent editorial on the
SFSA; Both contained numerous
factual "errors. The educational
series is, first of all, not a lecture
series, but a forum for discussion
of and free expression on issues
concerning apartheid and its con-
nections to American foreign

‘policy, the Cold War and the

arms race.

As you can see from our inten-
tion in this series, our focus goes
beyond ‘commemorating Black
History Month both in terms of is-

sues and duration of program. [...] ‘

In addition to our dismay with
the coverage of our series, we
must express indignation with the
Pitt ‘News's inconsistent and in-
comprehensible editorials on the
Students fo_r a Free South“Africa.
Last year, The Pitt Newscriticized
the SFSA for not promoting

' educational activities related to"

apartheid and racism._ This year,
after putting together an. editorial-

  Elderlywife gives up sex  

Q: I am 75, my wife is 64. We
are separated pending a divorce.
We were married in 1983 after
living together one year. (I had
been married before, very happi-
Iy, for 46 years.) My present wife
and I enjoyed sex together three
or four times a week. Before mar-
riage, if we had a disagreement
and I began packing, she would
dress in a see-through gown and
entice me into the bedroom. She
had the body of a 16-year-old.
Oursex life remained good well
into our marriage.

Then she had some surgery on
her hand and for some reason the
love machine came to a screech-
ing halt. For entertainment, she

reads paperback romances and

eats candy bars. She has gained
25 pounds, and her clothes don't
fit any longer. Two weeks ago,
she moved out. I want her back,
but she is adamant. I have had
sex with no other woman since
she cut me off, saying, ”Cet it
somewhere else.” I am tired of
pleasuring myself. Wl.at is the so-
lution?

A: I have only your side of this
story, so it looks like a case of a
woman whose motives come
from inside herself — capricious
and decisive. If what you tell me
is true, I think you have to learn
to accept the divorce since it is
out.of your hands.

But there is an interesting pos-
sibility that you have hidden
qualities that you are too modest
to mention, and that these did not
drive your first wife away from
you, but your second wife found
them to be something that she
"could live without. Next to some
guys in ruffled shirts in those
paperback stories, you don't look
so good to her. Sex with you is
not worth giving up an orgy of

- candy bars. 50 she's fat. Fat is fine

for reading and munching
chocolate-covered caramel with
nuts.

I would like to know what hap-
pened when she had that opera-

WESTHEIMER

tion, and if. your caring for her at
that time impressed her as suffi-
cient. I'm not accusing you, but
men don't always do the right
things at those times -— even nice
8UY5- ’ .

I think you should write to her
and propose that you both make
an effort to put your marriage
back together. Make an appoint-
ment with a marriage counselor
through a social agency, and tell
her you are doing that. It should
impress her that you want to
make amends and that youare
serious about wanting her back.
Now, she really may prefer her
candy and gushy stories to think-
ing about a real-life marriage and
your efforts may come to nothing.
But they may tip ‘the scales with
her.

Even if you can't mend this
marriage, you ought to learn from
it — even at 75. A man with love
on his mind is not too old to
learn. From failed marriages, we
say today, people can learn and
build better marriages the next
time.

Q: I am 26, a mother of two, and
I am severely‘ asthmatic. The
drugs I have to take endanger fe-
tuses and in combination with
pregnancy expose me to con-
siderablerisk. I know you are
against sterilization as a means of
birth control, but what about a

 

case like mine? My husband sug-
gests that he have a vasectomy,
but I think I am the one who
should be sterilized since I have
the health problem.

A: I would never interfere with a
decision like this. Where there is

a medical danger, the doctor and’

the patient make-the decisions. I
think you are fair to want the
operation instead of having your
husband go for a vasectomy, but
that, too, should be a medical de-
cision. You know that I am
against sterilization because it is
tempting fate.

None of us knows what life will
bring. Your husband might want
to start a family again sometime
a woman as brave and
thoughtful as you can face such
a possibility. I think you should
talk it over with your doctor, get
a second, opinion, consider the
risks of alternative measures to
avoid pregnancy and, within a
reasonable time, come to a deci-
sion. I know you will make the
right one.

Q. Recently I have been seeing
a lot of an exotic dancer who is
young enough to be my daugh-
ter._ My parents will ‘ soon be
celebrating their 50th anniver-
sary. I would like to invite her to
the party, but I fear that once the
music starts she might go into her
strip routine. Shouldl invite her?

A. I am not worried about what
she might do but what you might
do. A guy who invites a dancer
like that —— by the way, every-
body sees a lot of an exotic
dancer whenever she performs —
and worries what she might do is
trying to cover himself in humili-
ation. He is also trying to upstage
his own parents at their- own
golden wedding anniversary by
bringing such a young thing -
whilethey, a poor old endan-
gered species, are stuck with
senior citizens. For a present to
your parents, why don't you
grow up?

Reagan .-—— more than talk

There is, by now, firmly lodged
in the typical mentality, thanks in
large part to an unexpensible me
dia, the notion that the president
is all style and no substance. This
intention is predicated on a false
assumption - that style and con-
tent are entirely separable. Such
an argument holds no more water
in politics than in literature.

One should think of the presi-
dent's eloquence not as "insipid
rhetoric,” as one writer put it, but
rather as a re-affirmation of
patriotism. A

The more we believe in our po-
litical system, the more we'll
cherish it, and the harder we will
fight to preserve it — at home and
abroad. ‘

Consider the president's brilli-
antly chosen but already much-
maligned image of Benjamin
Franklin's description of the sun
imprinted on the back of James
Madison's chair at the Constitu-
tional Convention. (This _was
used in the State of the Union Ad-
dress.) After fighting an uphill bat-
tle for weeks, the Congress finally
produced a document that was
acceptable to all and held the na-
tion together. Upon signing the
Constitution, Franklin remarked
that he had often been unsure as

i JACK
BIIRKMAN

to whether the sun on the chair
had been rising or setting. But
now he knew it was rising.
Many cynics would dismiss this
as a colorful way to conclude a

‘speech. But inherent in the image

of the rising sun is a powerful
message. If out of nothing the
colonists couldcarve a nation
and then hold it together in the
face of insurmountable odds,
cannot we today, armed with
more power and wealth than any
nation in history, manage to over-
come squabbles over petty ex-
penses?

To be sure, such a message
wouldn't have been nearly as
poignant if it had been conveyed
prosaically.

The president's efforts to instill
confidence in the American peo-
ple have translated into a number
of tangible gains. Consider, why
are housing starts so high? Why
is inflation so low? Why are more
and more college students look-
ing to the future with hope?

Simple. The president has

resurrected the American -en-
trepreneurial spirit. How has he
done it? In part, we can attribute
his success to what hehad done.
But at the same time, we cannot
disregard what he has said and
how he has said it. Reagan has in-
stilled self-confidence in the
American people via images like
Franklin's rising sun; he has per-
suaded investors to have faith in
the ultimate ability of our free en-
terprise system to overcome
short-term difficulties.

Confidence, in some respects,
is like an infectious disease - it
spreads rapidly. We have seen
time and again how a televised
address from the president has
caused the stock market to sus-
tain and surpass levels never be-
fore reached.

In short, the president's im-
agery has played a significant role
in influencing American people
to think positively, to think of the
future. For some, this remains a
difficult task. Day after day, the
media insists upon dwelling on a
scandal, largely at the expense of
reporting other at least equally
significant issues. One can be
sure, however, that the president

, will not allow such negativism to

dampen his enthusiasm.

Drive through  
funeral home?

The Junior Funeral Home in
Pensacola, F|a., has added a
unique feature to its list of
services: a drive-through view-
ing window designed to make
it possible for mourners to see
the body of a deceased
without leaving their cars.

  

"It's" just like driving up to a
bank te|ler’s window," said ’
the funeral home. "The view-
ing window is built into one of
our outside walls. The deceased is placed on a platform that
holds the casket atan angle. You drive up and look at the depart-
ed person in the casket.”

The idea for this came from the owner of the funeral home,
Willie Junior.

"For as long as there have been funeral homes, people have

come to funeral homes for two reasons," Junior said. "The first"

reason is,a wake. The second reason is the funeral itself. By
installing thedrive-through viewing window, I have come up
with a third reason for people to come to a funeral home. They
come by just to see who's in the window."

Junior said the drive-through viewing window was installed
lastJu|y, but so far only "several" families of deceased persons
have chosen to have their loved one’s bodies displayed in the
window.

"Our funeral home is open until 8 p.m.," he said. "During

' the hours we are open, the body is displayed inside the funeral

home. But if a family chooses the option of having the body
displyed after hours, that is when the body will go to the view-
ing window.” _

He said the funeral home makes mention of this in death no-
tices it places in the local newspaper. "We will say, ‘Visitation
from 6 to 8 p.m. Drive-through viewing from 8:30 p.m. until
midnight.’ " .

The first time the drive-through window was used for view-
ing, Junior said, approximately 50 motorists came to the funer-
al home to take a look. ”At times the cars were lined up behind
each other," he said. ' ’ ~ ‘ I

. ' He emphasized, however, that there was no honkinlgl. "The" 

people in the cars showed great respect for the deceased," he
said.

One potential problem is that, the way the Junior funeral
home is constructed, the viewing window is built into a wall
on the passenger side of the cars that drive through the view-
ing lane. Thus, when a motorist pulls up to the window, he or
she has to look across the front seat to see the body in the
window. ‘ _

"That’s really nothing to worry about," Junior said. "You can
just slide across the front seat to get a better view.”

One of the features of the viewing window is a metal drawer
that slides out from the wall, just like the drawers that drive-
through bank tellers use. i

"We have a guest book in the drawer,” Junior said. ”So you i

can reach out of the window of your car and sign the guest book.
Both the guest book and the pen are bolted down, so no one
can steal them from the drawer.”

In additionphe said, mourners may place sympathy cards in
the drawer. When the drawer slides back in, the sympathy cards
drop into the viewing. room.

”The cards do not drop on the body of the" deceased,” Junior
said. "They drop onto the floor of the room."

The average mourner, he said, spends between three and five
minutes parked next to the viewing window. "Some people
keep their motors running; some turn their motors off. It is en-
tirely up to the individual.”

He said he expects use ofthe window to increase as people
become more used to the idea. One of the things he has going
for him, he said, is location. ,

"We're on a busy street," Junior said. "We're right down the
street from the Civic Arena. The Hilton Hotel is about four
blocks away. If people are on their way to the Civic Arena, they
can drive through our viewing lane to see if anyone’s in -the
window. As a matter of fact, some people drive through even
when there's no one in the window. They just want to see what
the window looks like.’'

What the motorists see, he said-, is a small room "with lights
positioned to give the deceased a natural glow. We also have
a spotlight on the outside of the building to provide exterior
lighting. The viewing window itself is made of double-strength
security glass.” .

Junior said the community reaction has been generally

_ positive.

"The word is spreading," he said. "Just today, a woman said
to me, ’Mr. Junior, I'd like to have my nephew placed in the
window.’ The woman brought it up on her own. There is abso-
lutely no hard sell."

Japanese influence
a stable U.S. economy

By Jack Burkman

- Staff Writer V ~

Economic ties to Japan are im-
portant in maintaining stabiliza-
tion of the U.S. economy,
according to University of
Maryland political science profes-
sor’Davis Bobrow, who spoke at
Pitt Wednesday afternoon.

”Any sharp break with Japan
would seriously destabilize the
U.S. economy,” Bobrow said. ’’If
the Japanese were to dump their
U,S. T-bills," very serious econom-
ic ramifications for the United
States would result.”

For this reason, Bobrow be-
lieves heavy U,S. trade barriers
on Japan would be self-defeating.

”Any major barriers would hurt
America economically and stra-
tegically. Our two economies are
becoming increasingly inter-

dependant,” he said.

Present U.S.-Japanese difficul- '

ties stem largely from U.S. inac-
tion, Bobrow contended.

”We are the loose cannon in
the relationship,” he said. ”The
Japanese have been waiting pa-
tiently for us to re-establish com-
petant management of our own
economy. They had assumed we
would have done this by now.”

Bobrow said Tokyo has more
than done its share.

”Japan has helped the U.S.

‘government to finance its

deficit,” said Bobrow. ”She’s in-
creased her rate of defense
spending faster than any of the

European nations. What more

can we ask?” —

How has Japan risen from to-
tal destruction to economic inter-
dependence with the world's
greatest power? _

”The Japanese have a very
sophisticated practical view of
reality,” Bobrow said. ”Their bas-
ic principle is to have no princi-
ples, but rather adapt to
ever-changing situations.”

By Dave Zatris

Colin Hay had the misfortune
of being too successfgul too
quickly. Hay, the former lead
singer of Men At Work, led the

oup to two number l singles
off their first album.

The two songs that propelled
the Australian group into Ameri-
can pop-music land, the para-
noid "Who Can lt Be Now?"
and the upbeat "Down Under,”
haunted the group to their even-
tual break-up.

Hay, speaking in a phone in-

terview, said it was definitely
time for a change in the group
after their last tour.
- "Our first album went over
great, and everyone expected
us to live up to that,” Hay said.
"Our second album did well
too, but our third album sold
about five copies, I think."

Critics, not surprisingly, com-
pare Hay's new solo LP, look-
ing For Jack, to Men At Work's
debut album, and they say
Hay's definitely lost something
since he split up from the band.

But his solo effort also benefits
from the demise of Men At
Work. Now it can be compared
to Men At Work's last album,

which suffered from being com—-

pared to their first album — get
it?

Putting album comparisons
aside, Hay is a complex person.
Most of the songs he writes have
a gloomy quality about them,
even though he doesn't seem to
have a gloomy personality.

Davitt Sigerson once wrote in
The \//'//age Voice that "Who
Can It Be Now?" was the first
hit single about hiding out at
home. ,

But judging from.Hay's lively
stage performances and his

cheery voice over thephone, he.

seems like a person who wants
people to knock on his door.
"| don't know why a lot of my
songs come out that way, l don't
get depressed a lot," he ‘said.
''I'm really a pretty happy

guy, butl like to daydream a lot. -

I've always done that. I just like
to wander off and think
sometimes.”

Alienation is a major theme in
many of Hay's songs.

" 'Who Can It Be Now?’ was
a song about alienation — but
sugar-coated alienation. Not

'Oh God, I'll go slit my wrists,' '

but 'l think I'll go back to bed for
the rest of the week.’ "

The title cut from Looking for
Jack comes from the moment
when Hay wrote "Who Can lt
Be Now?"

Hay said the memory was of
many years ago when he was

with his girlfriend on her parents’

ZZA

    
   
   
 

    
  
 

+ tax

farm. He described being on a
farm for the first time and sitting
in the tall grass, listeningto it rus-
tle around him and his girlfriend
Linda. .

"l wrote 'Who Can lt Be
Now?’ in the bush on that piece
of land. There were only the
frogs and Linda and me. The
words come from the fact that l
was living in St. Kilda in a flat on
the dale, and l was scared of
who was knocking on the door.

'’It was always someone look-
ing for the rent, or the police, or

‘the social security people check-

ing to be sure you were active-
ly looking for employment.

"The lyrics were real ac-
curate," he said."When some-
one showed up outside the
door, there was a floorboard
that squeaked, and |'d look out
the key hole to see who it was."

A line from "Looking For
Jack," Hear the wind b/ow
through the ta// grass// bear the
laughter in the_n/'ght/ comes from
that night on the farm.

So why is it appearing in lyr-
ics for this album?

"The title song is from Linda's

fur thnse fnhn

a certain smell or a certain-song

stayed with me."

Hay said there's no specificllgl
reason for the title of the song 9.
"Looking For'Jack." The name 0'.

Jack doesn't really have any sig-
nificance.

"You can substitute really '1
-anything you like forlackz love, : '

happiness, even money. Jack's
iust a symbol for the wanting
people have in life." ' ’

Hay said he writes most of his

songs from things that stuck in his
head.
''I always do that, actually. l

like to look back and remember —

things. But | think this is a really
upbeat album."

Hay said the songs are a lot
more personal than his earlier
work because now he doesn't
have any other bandmembers
putting in their opinions.

WAREHOUSE: SONGS
AND STORIES

Husker Du

Warner Bros.

By John Young

Since their inception, two
types of studio-recorded double
albums have emerged in rock
music. With one type, a band
fills four sides with songs of a
similar, well—defined style or
sound — a /a the hardcore funk
of the Minutemen on Daub/e
/\/ic/<e/s On The Dime or the
loose, raucous blues on Ex/'/e on
Main Street from The Rolling
Stones.

The second kind of double al-
bum demonstrates instead a
band's range, experimenting
with various song structures,

_styles and genres. The Beatles’

classic, eclectic White A/bum is
anexample, as is Husker Du's
first two-LP set Zen Arcade.
The Huskers have employed
the first approach, however, on
their latest album, a 2-record set
entitled Warehouse: Songs And
Stories. There, are no fast-paced
songs that approach the orgas-
mic frenzy of the band's early
work, nor are there any acous-
tic songs on Warehouse. What

transporting as well. Highlight-

ing but a few songs seems 

almost unfair; ”Visionary" and
”|t’s Not Peculiar" are among
numerous remaining gems.

Drummer Grant Hart's compo-
sitions on Warehouse prove to
be far less consistent than
i\/lould’s. While Hart once. sang
passionately about a lover who
overdosed (on "Pink Turns To
Blue," again from Zen Arcade),
he now sings in more generic,
less personal terms about an ad-
dict coloring his life with "Too
Much Spice.” ”You’re A Soldi-
er" doesn’t even attempt to be
metaphorical and comes off as
a weak, snotty swipe at armed
forces enlisted men, while ”You

Can Live At Home” suffers from '

its pop metal arrangement.
Hart does best when he tries

some new musical styles in com-

-bination with his band's sonic

overdrive. ”She Floated Away"

is a spirited, folk—influenced sing— ~

along, and "Actual Condition"
tips its hot to l950s rockabilly.
Hart's unconventional lyrical

storytelling turns "Back From.
”She's A

It  TIEIEI, PITI Ewe, Eebruary ‘6, I987

    

By Ike Shibley

David Byrne has been hailed
by Time magazine as ”rock’s

‘renaissance man.5' As the lead

singer of the Talking Heads, he
has provoked much critical

response, mostof it positive. His _

lyrics are often off-beat but
almost always insightful.
Stop /I/la/<ing,, Sense was a

I Talking Heads’ concert film that

may well serve as the prime ex-

ample of how to make concert .
films. It was lauded throughout -

the country as a work of art.

S5/‘Now with his latest film, David

Byrne has taken almost complete
control of production. He is the
writer, star and director of his
own movie called True Stories.

The construction ofthe film is
unconventional and contains
many contrasts. The story is told
through the eyes of a nalrator,
who often interacts with the

Q, people he is talking about. There
’ is much singing and dancing in

the film, but it could hardly be
categorized as a musical. Most
of the characters are eccentric,
yet they are easy to relate to.

Much of the film's uniqueness
can be attributed to the director.
Byrne takes control of True Sto-
ries with the confidence of a
much more experienced direc-
tor. He is not afraid to use -un-I
conventional devices. He knows

. exactly whathe wants to do.

4

Because he ha_s control ofthe
writing, he has more power as
a director. This is truly Byrne’s
movie.

There are moments when this
movie is merely an extensionof
MTV. Music is often an impor-
tant part of a cinematic event. It
sets the mood, emphasizes the
tension and underscores the ac-
tion. In True Stories the score
and the songs are superbly well
suited to the situations. The
songs are as much a part of the

1 movie as the actors and actress-
3'-es ’ singing them. Recent films

have begun to look like extend-
ed rock videos — Top Gun, Vi-

sion Quest and The Breakfast.

C/ub are only a few examples of‘

films. that have. soundtracks»

which have become lust as, if
not more, popular than the
movie itself. '

,g- This film has the trappings of

this pitfall, but it does nothave
the same pretensions as the
others. Scenes seem to demand
music in the film. They are de-
pendent on the music to bring
about a desired response. There
are no obvious attempts to con-
struct a scene which could serve
as a backdrop to a possible Top

‘ 40 song. The flight scenes in Top

Gun and the dancing sequence
in the library scene of The Break-
tast C/ub seem to do lust that.

The ”Wild Life" segment of the

film is a visual event that is ac-
centuated by the audio. It is not
a means to an end designed sim-
ply to showcase the song.
One major difference be-
tween True Stories and the films

‘I’. just mentioned is that Byrne

wrote all the music and lyrics for
this film. This separates him from
the rest of his contemporaries.

He is aware ofwhat each '

song's power is, andfhe usesthis

  

knowledge effectively in the sto-
ry development. It is a tremen-
dous cr‘eative advantage for a
director to have complete con-
trol over the script and music.
Byrne uses this power to his ut-
most advantage.

True Stories is visually stun-
ning. There is a fashion show
which looks strikingly familiar to
the one in Fellini's Roma. l\/lany

_ strange and inferesting designs
are exhibited that are not only "

impractical but also unbelieva-
ble. 'In another fascinating
scene, a myriad of people each
take a turn lip synching "Wild

Life.” The procession of person-'
alities across the stage occurs so

rapidly that the viewer is not

given a chance to blink for fear"

of missing someone. The other
standout scene is a talent show
held in honor of the town's

-. sesquicentenial in which the

townspeople try to exhibit their
individual skills. -

Not only is much of this movie
a treat for the eye, but it is a
boost emotionally because of
the laughter that it so often

_ elicits. Byrne's deadpan narra-

tive delivery is full of humor, yet

it is so dry that one might not no-_

tice it. He continually comments
on the people of Virgil, Texas —
the imaginary town that is the fo-
cus of the film — andin doing so,
he voices his opinions about

America in general. His witticismbb
is -often hidden beneath his

placid and never-changing
countenance. It is nearly impos-
sible_to detect if Byrne thinks he
has said something comical, but
more often, than not he has.

The people of Virgil are the
ones who can be seen walking
the streets of any small town.
They have high goals that are
constrained by immediate

 
   
 

Rock’s renaissance
man tells True Stories

wants. l\/lost want a better life

but are too set in their ways to -

take the chances necessary to
cause a change. One plant wor-
ker wants a wife and will go to
any extremes to get one, includ-
ing advertising himself on televi-
sion. There is a woman in Virgil
who is so rich that she never
leaves her bed. She has
machines that feed her, allow
her to drink without using her
hands and to read without hav-
ing to turn the pages. One cou-
ple has not spoken to each other

for many years and communi-

cate only through their children.
At the dinner table, the father
asks his daughter to ask, her
mother to pass the salt and the
mother tells her daughter to’ tell
her father to pass the gravy. So
much of the town is odd that, by
the end of the film, the viewer

‘ begins to accept the.behavior as

normal. Maybe this is what
Byrne wanted.

The final comment that Byrne
makes is paraphrased as fol-
lows: ’’I had fun forgetting.
When I go to someplace new,
I notice every detail,iuntil I don't
see it anymore. Then when I go
away and come back, it is total-

ly new to me, and I can appreci- ‘

ate it all over again." This is
what the film is about. He im-
plores the viewer to notice de-
tails. He travels to Virgil because
they are having a ”celebration
of specialness even though the
people themselves are aver-
age." B-yrne is celebrating

America and the people who
live, there. He is looking at the
country ina different way in_an
attempt to "coerce the viewer to
see that each person is an in-
dividual. It is not a message of .
pessimism, but one of hope.

/ don't need you anymore/ /
don ’t need you anymore now.

So sings Colin James Hay on
his first solo outing called look-
ing for Jack. Hay’s voice was
recognizable for a few years as
the lead singer of Men at Work.

With the help of his past suc-
cess, he has now landed a
recording contract with Colum-
bia Records.

Hay seems bitter about having
to travel alone now in the music
world, but he lets it be known in
songs like "l Don't Need You
Anymore” that he will be fine
without a band. y

/ stand alone in the harbour

As Hay tries to continue his ’

musical career, he will no longer
have the help or companionship

 ‘THE »PlTl' NEWS, Friday, February‘ 6, i987

David Lettermanto be on Friday nights

By Bob Travers A

NBC is giving us a good rea-
son to come home early on Fri-
day nights this summer when
Late Night with David Letterman
begins airing five nights a week
starting June 8. Right now, late
/\/ight airs only Monday-
Thursday at l2:3O a.m. The Fri-

day night program will also air

‘ at l2:3O a.m.

In expanding the hit show,-
which tallied its highest ratings
ever the week between Christ-
mas and New Year's Day, NBC
will bump ”Friday Night
Videos" back to l :30 a.m. and
cut the show from its present 90
minute format down to 60
minutes. . .

One drawback for Late Night
fans is the fact that with the ex-

- pansion one show per weekwill

be a repeat. It would seem to
make sense to air a repeat ev-
ery Friday when a healthy chunk
of Letterman's audience is in no

physical or mental condition to i

watch TV. In addition," a large
percentage of viewers would
presumably be people who do
not watch the show Monday
through Thursday because they
have to get up early in the‘morn-
ing. (l believe it was Aristotle
who said, ”A repeat is not a
repeat if you have never seen
the show before”) But NBC
spokesman Peter Spivey says it's
not so. ~

’’The late Night audience is
more heterogeneous than you
would think,”. Spivey said. ”We
are always trying to attract new
viewers to the show, but l don't

othinkputting the show on Fridays

is a real effort to attract_a whole
new type of audience. The rat-
ings show thgt‘_rFria’a__/\//'ght

  

  

Videos frequently does better
than [ate Night."

ln other late Night news, the
show celebrates its fifth year of
broadcast with a 90-minute spe-
cial tomorrow night at l l :30.
Comedians Jay Leno and Carol
Leifer are scheduled to appear.
Most of the show will be a
greatest hits montage of the
show’s funniest moments from
the past l2 months. Get your
VCRs ready.

THE PITT NEWS

Wertz hoping to reach A-A goal

By Tom Zuck

Staff Writer

When thinking of prominent
Panther wrestlers over the past
few years, the names that are
most commonly mentioned are
Jeff Jelic and Kyle Nellis, who
have since graduated, and sopho-
more Pat Santoro.

This year it is co-captain Eric
Wertz’ turn to come to the fore-
front of the Pantherwrestling

scene.

Wertz, a fifth—year senior from
Altoona, has used his outgoing
and vocal practice methods to in-
spire his teammates. ”Eric has be-
come probably the best captain
I have had in my eight years as
the head coach,” said Pitt
wrestling coach Rande Stott—
lemyer. ”He is not afraid to step
on some toes to get the message
across —- for guys to get their acts
together”;

Wertz is Pittsburgh's kind of
wrestler. He has had to work hard
for everything that he has accom-
plished at Pitt. ”He does not have
all the ability that some of the
other guys have,” said Stott-
lemyer. ”He has had to get his
hands dirty to win.”

All of this hard work has paid
off for Wertz. This season his
record is 25-7, which has helped
him attain a numbernine nation-
al ranking.

At the prestigious Penn State In-
vitational in December, Wertz
took first place at 158 pounds.
Quite an accomplishment con-
sidering it was his first tourna-
ment at a lighter weight 158
pounds. In fact, Wertz is 13-2 af-
ter moving down to 158.

Wertz also had first-place
finishings at the Ohio Open and
theMat Town Invitational at Lock
Haven back in November.

By John Enright

Sports Editor

VILLANOVA, PA. — Rollie
Massimino didn't act like a
coach who had just watched
his team lose, despite the fact
the Pitt Panthers had just beat-
en his Villanova Wildcats,
58-57, at DuPont Pavilion be-
fore a sell-out crowd of 6,500
on Wednesday night.

Massimino stood in front of
a podium and chided the
sports writers who couldn't
understand his strategy in the
last 14 seconds of the game
when his Wildcats had posses-
sion of the ball and a chance
to win ‘the game. .

”You guys are just scribes,”

away on a cigar,4which is

usually reserved for those as-

sociated with the winning
team. ‘ E -
This definitely didn't appea

to be a coach who had just
lost, but it was. Obviously,

undermanned Wildcats (12-9,
5-5 in Big East play) had been
in the position to upset the
Panthers (18-4, 7-2) — even
though it didn't happen.
”We played an outstanding
basketball game,” said Mas-
simino. ”We got an opportu-
nity to win the game except
we missed. It was another one
of those close Big East games.”
Pitt coach Paul Evans was
pleased with the victory, but
he dismissed ‘the theory that
Villanova was outmanned
against his team. ”I don't
know if they’re really out-
manned. They have a great
backcourt with [Kenny] Wil-

"Brookin and center Charles

son and Jensen and Doug

just lack a good big man.”
And that was too much for
Villanova to overcome, con-
sidering Pitt had three good
big men .on_this’ night. For- _
wards Jerome Lane and Rod

Smith each scored 15 points _
and combined for 23 re-
bounds. 4

The Panthers, who surpris-
ingly were out-rebounded by
the smaller Wildcats 27‘-26,
pounded the ball down _low

”There’s nothing wrongjwith

Smith. ”It’s just that he has -
trouble rebounding because
he's out of position [at small

Cannon readyto explode for talented Pitt trackteam

60-yard hurdles at the West Vir- 

By Sam Tallarico
For The Pitt News

When you first think of the Pitt
track team, Lee McRae’s name is
almost certain to pop up. Pitt,
however, has another rising star
in sophomore hurdler Eric
Cannon.

Cannon, who burst onto the
scene last year as a freshman, was
an All-Big East and All-America
indoor 60-yard hurdler. And if his
performance -so far this season is
any indication of what's to come,

. look for Cannon to duplicate last
. year's feat.

His accomplishments this year
show that he is once again com-

, ing into his own. He won the

ginia Invitational, and he just
missed qualifying for the final
heat of the Millrose Games in
New York last weekend.
Cannon has already qualified
for the NCAA this year_ in the
60-yard hurdles‘, running the se-
cond fastest time ever at the

University of Michigan's indoor .

track. _
b ’’With Eric's speed and ability,
there's no limit of what he can
do," said Pitt men's track coach
John Vasvary. ”He has done a lot
of great things already. His speed
has increased, and his hurdle
technique is better.” _ ‘
Cannon, who was born in

' Richmond, vé.-, but went to-Del 7

  

CastlesHigh School in Delaware,
excelled at both football and
track. He was All-State and All-
Conference in football and track.
In addition, Cannon was an
Honorable Mention All-
American. 3
Running gets all of Cannon’s at-
tention, and he's beginning to
catch everyone else’s attention,_
too. -
”My goals for this year are to
win the ‘Big East and NCAA
championship for both indoor
and out,” said Cannon. ”Before
I graduate, I'd like to win it more
than once.” . '
4 It seems rather obvious that
Cannon sets high. goals for him-

- self, but it’s_‘not as if'he can't han-

dle it.

”I’ve been shaky up and down
so far this season,” said Cannon.
‘'1 did well in the first two meets,
but not,as wellas lexpected. As
for the Millrose Games, ‘I .didn’t
do too well. I could have done
better.” ~

Vasvary is very proud of what
Cannon can do, not just as a hur-
dler, but as a hard worker as well.
”He has an impact on this team
as a performer. He does sprints
and hurdles, and he's a-good
worker on the team, and that
helps everyone. '

”He’s been a cool performer.
since he was a freshman — an
All-American as a freshman —

and has risen’ ‘to’ the occassion:

-cal engineer. When he looks for i.

__4p'.m_ ,

 

 

The guys on the team say, ‘Look’
at what he can do  I can do it,

Aside from being a hurdler, I

relaxation he turns to walking,
shooting pool and listening to -‘
music. But running is most im- ’
portant to him, and it shows. He
is expecting it to continue for the
rest of the season. _ .

”This_ year I'm on track for what’
I want to do, an_d I'm hoping for
a successful year,” said Cannon.”

I up — a definite detriment for
the Wildcats.

Villanova came right back
with a 10-point run of its own,
though, to grab a 37-36 advan-
tage, as Jensen hit two three-
pointers.

The sell-out crowd was back
in the game, but Pitt point
guard Mike Goodson silenced
the fans with a three-pointer of
his own. ”My-job is to keep
the team together,” said
Goodson. "I had the open
shot, andl just _took it.”

The Panthers never trailed
again. Villanova tied the game
three times, the last at 47-47
with 8:49 remaining. But,
Evans substituted walk-on
guard Pat Cavanaugh, and the
move paid off. Cavanaugh
came up with two big steals
and his 15-foot jumper at 5:27
gave Pitt a 57-50 lead.

It was the Panthers’ lastfield
goal of the game as their only
other point came on a Smith
free throw.

The Wildcats cut the lead to
58-57 on anotherjensen three

pointer (his fifth of the game)
and, due to a missed one-and-
one foul shot by Lane, they
had the ball with :14 left and
a chance to win.

Enter Smith, the Big East's
leading shotblocker, who had
four rejections in the game -
but none that was more time-
ly than the last one. Jensen,
who scored 19 points, took
the inbounds pass from Wil-
son and drove into the lane
where Smith greeted him with
a big-league rejection that
Brookin rebounded.

”He [Jensen] had the ball for
so long all eyes were on him,”
said Smith. ”When he came
into the lane, I just went up

. with him.”

Brookin grabbed the reject-
ed shot and was fouled, but he
missed the one-and-one.

Villanova had the ball at
their own time line with :06
left, but Lane fouled Wilson in
the backcourt as the Wildcats
were not in the bonus yet.

Because Lane fouled Wilson =

in the lane, the Wildcats were
forced to take the ball out un-
der their own basket. ”We
wanted to make sure they had
to take itout in the back-

court,” said Evans.

Wildcat Gary Massey’s full
court desperation inbounds
pass was deflected by. Smith
and recovered by Cavanaugh
as the buzzer went off.

The win improved Pitt's Big
East road record to 4-0. Quite
a change for a team that was
4-12 on the road the previous
two seasons in Big East play.
’’I think that is maturity along
with coaching,” said Smith. ’’If
we lose we have to worry
about practice the next day.”

Lady Panthers lose,
still winless in Big East

By Matt O'Hara

Sta ff Writer

The Pitt Lady Panther basket-
ball team lost yet another Big-East
matchup to conference leader
Villanova 79-56 on Wednesday
night.

The Lady Wildcats improved
their unblemished league mark to
10-0 and 19-2 overall. Pitt,
however, fell to 0-11 in the Big
East, 5-16 overall.

”We knew what to expect. Vil-

lanova is well coached, plus.

they've got the best player in the
Big East (Shelly Pennefather) and
a senior- dominated supporting
cast,” said Pitt assistant coach
John LeMieux.

Pennefather scored 25 points to
became Villanova’s all-time lead-
ing scorer (men and women),
passing the 2,170 point total of
Keith Herron.

Pitt was led by sophomore for-
ward Amy Holman —- 16 points,
eight rebounds —- and senior for-
ward Jane Plake -— 7 of 11 from

the field and finished with 16
points. Junior forward Sally
Sheerer added 12 points.

Besides Pennefather, Villanova
had only one other player in
double-figure scoring — guard
Karen Hargadon, who had 14.

”We played better than the
score reflects,” said LeMieux.
’’I’m happy with the effort we put
out. They played with an intensi-

‘ty we haven't seen in several

games.”-

Although LeMieux was pleased
with the Lady Panthers'-perfor-
mance in general, he could not
look past the shortcomings.

”We do too much with the
ball. We only had nine assists on
25 field goals. Villanova, on the
other hand, had 33 assists on 35
field goals,” LeMieux added.

The Lady Panthers travel to
Syracuse tomorrow afternoon for
a league game against the
Orangewomen. Syracuse defeat-
ed Pitt at the field house earlier
in the season.

Bloomsburg stiff opposition for wrestlers

By Vince Carey
Staff Writer ‘ '

The Pitt Panther wrestling team
travels to Bloomsburg University
tonight in hopes of improving
their 9-1 record. Bloomsburg is
currently ranked seventh ‘in the
country.

‘ 

It will be a tough
meet, but our guys will
be in them all.

— Rande Stottlemyer

”They are a little banged up
right now, so that will give us an
extra chance to beat them,” said
Pitt coach Rande Stottlemyer. ’’It
will be a tough meet, but our
guys will be in them all.”

Of late, the strength of the Pitt
line up — Pat Santoro, Eric
Wertz, and Gary Bolin — has not
wrestled up to par. Last Sunday
against Navy, Bolin pulled a tie
and Wertz lost. Monday, at an
All—Star meet which took place at
Edinboro University, Santoro was
decisioned 9-8. Yet Stottlemyer

doesn't see a problem.

”Those matches will keep the
guys honest,” said Stottlemyer.
”Eric [Wertz] was on such a roll
that he thought anything would
work. The loss will bring him
back to earth. Another part of it
was that last Sunday there were
too many distractions, and Eric
got caught up in them more than
anyone else. As far as Pat [San-
toro] and Gary [Bolin] are con-
cerned, I look for them to come
back strong. It has just made them
work harder.” —

According to Stottlemyer, the
key match at Bloomsburg will
take place at the 150—division in
which Bolin will square off with
Bloomsburg’s Dave Morgan.
”Whoever wins this match will
win the whole thing,” Stott-
lemyer said. _

Bolin does see a few changes
that he has to make after his last
few matches. ”I can't get frustrat-
ed during the match; that would

be my downfall,” said Bolin._

”My strategy is going to be to
keep it close for the first two peri-
ods then blow him away in the
last. As long as I can keep my in-
tensity up, there should be no
problem. Another thing I have to

He has already had a good
senior season, but there is more
to be accomplished. ”I feel I can
do well in the NCAA tournament;
winning it all is not totally out of
my reach,”.said Wertz.

That goal is realistic when one
looks at Wertz’ record against
other nationally ranked oppo-
nents this season — 4-1. Wertz
has defeated Top 20 wrestlers
from Clarion, Penn State, Lock
Haven and Lehigh, while losing

to fifth-ranked Paul McShane of_

Wisconsin. ‘

With a very tough conference
schedule in the next few weeks
and the Eastern Wrestling League
championships in March, the
11th-ranked Panthers (9-1) will
have their work cut out for them.

Wertz agrees, but he's very
confident in his teammates: ’’I’m
not surprised about the team's

success overall, because we have‘

a bunch of class guys on the
team.”

6   THE1APITIPTNPEWS,--—Fridci)c‘ February 36,-‘ 19376 1 .

Rickert one special  

By Beth Froelich
Staff Writer

Pitt sophomore Tricia Rickert is -~

the. ”freestyle specialist” and
mainstay of the Lady Panther
swim team. .

Rickert has shown an excep-
tional amount of versatility this

‘ year, swimming successfully in

both long-distance events and
sprints.

Early odds have it that Rickert
will be the one to beat in the

1.00-, 200- and 500—yard freestyle r
. at the upcoming Big East Cham-

pionships. _
Rickert is the reigning Big East

Champion in the 200-yard

freestyle, and she hopes to repeat

. that first-place performance again.

this year. The only person who
may stand in her way is a fresh-
man from Villanova, Laurel
Fournier. ' A

”The team depends on Rickert
to do big things,” said Pitt wom-
en's swimming coach David Bel-
lowich. ”She hasn’t.let us down
yet. She's a really fierce compe-
titor. Ihave faith that she will do
very well at the Big East Champi-
onships.”

Rickert also has a chance to
make it to the NCAA Champion-
ships as a member of either the

200-, 400- or 800-yard freestyle,

relay teams, all of which are very
close to qualifying. .

. The NCAA Championships are I

a constant motivating factor for
Rickert. Her goal is to qualify in

' an individual event at some point

«specialist for swimmers

in her career.
A ”The NCAA Championships

are very important. It's "what

we’re.here for, and it's what I.

train for,” said Rickert. ”lt’s the
team's final destination after the
Big East Championships.” -

‘One thing that sets Rickert
apart from other swimmers is her
incredible consistency. Most
swimmers’ times fluctuate be-
tween peak performances, but
Rickert’s times appear to remain
on an even keel throughout the
season.

”I think my consistency makes
me a better swimmer,” shé com-
mented. ’’I am very happy with
the fact that my times don't
change that much. They're get-
ting down to where I want them
to be for championship compe-
tition.”

Rickert is originally from Wil-
mington, Del., where she re-
ceived a solid foundation,
competing both on her high
school swim team and a U.S.
Swimmimg League team. She
also had qualifying times in dis-
tance freestyle events for the
Junior Nationals.

Rickert is not-surprised by the
success she has experienced in
collegiate swimming. She main-
tains that she has gotten what she
has worked for.

Her formula for success is a

. simple one: ”Train hard, concen-
« trate during the races, keep a

clear head and learn from your
mistakes.”

Rickert’s winning attitude has
carried her and the Panther squad
far in this 5-2 season. Facing top-
ranked Brown University this
weekend and with the Big East
Championships coming up, Rick-
ert’s»most challenging races lie

' ahead. And you can bet she'll be

ready for them.

Garcia and Vaughn will both 3

be in action tonight when the
Lady Panthers compete against
the University of North Carolina
tonight at Trees Hall at 7. Garcia
will only compete bars because
of a stressfracture to her right
shin. Dr. Freddie Fu took Garcia
off the other three events and will
not let her dismount bars except
in competition. ”He says that I
could break my leg completely
on any bad landing,” said Garcia.

Garcia has found this injury

3 veryhardto deal with, especial-

ly since it developed during her
freshman year and, although she
has rested during both her fresh-
man and sophomore summers,
the fracture would not heal. ”It’s
very hard to stay motivated be-
cause nobody enjoys doing the
same event day after day,” said

19‘

Garcia.

Teammate Vaughn, who will
compete vault, bars and beam
and is expected to exhibition
floor tonight, has had similar

problems with injuries._Vaughn__ _

has a damaged sciatic nerve and
chronic back pain, which also be-
gan in her freshman year. ”l’ve
had to learn how to work with
the pain,”
to plan my workouts day by day
because the pain is never the
same two days in a row.”
Currently, these two gymnasts

‘are roommatesin the Towers, but

they say they still get homesick at
times.

’’I’m occasionally homesick,
but I'm very independent and
used to travelling,” said Vaughn.

Garcia just laughed and said,-

”I’m very close to my family, and
I miss them a lot. I am always
homesick.”
