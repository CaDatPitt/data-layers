Dean to Teach After Retirement

No Rest for Maorier

by DIANE HOLLINGSWORTH

Dr. Paul H. Masoner is not a,
man to rest on his laurels. Mason-
er, currently Dean of the School
of Education, will be retiring as
Dean in September, but will con-
tinue to teach graduate-level
courses, as well as being active
in special projects sponsored by
the School of Education.

Dr. Masoner, who -is 66, has had
25 years of administrative experi-
ence at the University. He came
to Pitt in 1945 as counselor for re-
turning veterans, along with lec-
turing in psychology. The post-
war years, he notes, were the per-
iod of greatest growth for the
University, enrollment increasing
to 25,000 in two years‘. The School
of Education grew accordingly,’
although a serious teacher short-
age developed in the fifties and
sixties. ‘

Growth in recent years has

— reached the point that the United

States now faces a surplus of
teachers, many more than the
jobs available. Dr. Masoner ob-
serves, “This does not mean there
are not opportunities. The public
could use more teachers, but are
often unwilling to pay for better
quality education. And there are
still shortages in special educa-
tion, elementary guidance, voca-
tional training, and work in the
inner city.”

Dr. Masoner promises that the
enforced cutback in enrollment at
the School of Education will be
taken as an opportunity to im-
prove the quality of teacher ed-
ucation. Prospective teachers will

be evaluated not only on perfor--

mance but also on personal quali-
ties, such as commitment.

The mission of a school of ed-

. ucation in a state-related univer-

sity, as Dr. Masoner sees it, is
to “train a modest number of stu-
dents of high quality as exemplary
models. At the graduate level, our
major task is to prepare admin-
istrators, supervisors, research-
ers, and university faculty.”

But that is only part of the re-
_spon,sibility, he feels; the School
of Education should also work to
improve education, provide con-
sultative -service and help to al-

leviate racial and social injus-.

tices.

In the 17 years that Dr. Mason-
er has been Dean, a variety of new
programs have been begun." He
points with pride to the Depart-
ment of Special Education and
Rehabilitation, the Department
of Higher Education, the Depart-
ment of International and Devel-
opmental -«Education, the Depart-
ment of Educational Research,
the Department of Curriculum
ahp Supervision, and the Depart-
ment of Counselor Education. All
of these programs have made
their greatest progress in the past
10-15 years.

"The School of Education is par-
ticularly interested in work in. the
model cities area. The Center for
Educational Action has‘ been de-

veloped to prepare teachers for

this complex problem.

Dr. Masoner is looking forward
to his “retirement”; after 25
years as an administrator, he will
have more time to teach, work
with the internationa_l studies pro-
gram, and write. He is a corres-

. pondent for the London Times Ed-

ucational Supplement.

“The future looks interesting
and exciting,” he says.

]Vevv Institute on HumanEcology

Provides Awareness, Involvement  

by BUZZELLI

Rebuilding of the environment,
developing awareness within the
community and providing ave-
nues of direct public involvement
will be the mission of the /newly
formed Institute" on Human Eco-
logy of Southwestern Pennsyl-
vania.

Charged with the this task are
members of the new Institute’s
executive committee: Dr. Thom-
as C... Howard of California State
College, Dr. Charles R. Fuget of
Indiana University of Pennsyl-'
vania, Dr. Edward R. McNutt of
Penn State’s New Kensington
campus, and Dr. Sushanta K. Ben-
erjee of Point Park College.

The counties to be serviced by
the Institute’s program include
Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver,

Butler, Cambria, Fayette, Greene, .

Indiana, «Somerset, Washington,
and Westmoreland.

Dr. Fuget, who heads the pro-
ject, illustrated the nature of the
problem by pointing out that cit-
ies, suburban, and rural areas
throughout Southwestern Pennsyl-
vania suffer from various types of
unnecessary “degradation of the
environment” and consequent re-

_duction in’.-the quality of life of

the residents.

“Not enough people in-the area
know about this problem. Not
enough -people understand its
depth, or are not concerned
enough to take the necessary po-
litical, legal, economic, or physi-
cal steps to restore or conserve
the environment, thus improving
the quality of life,” he said.

Dr. Fuget stressed that this is
not simply a “college or univer-
sity” problem. He said, “Every

person in this part of Pennsyl-.

vania breathes air, drinks water,
and lives on the land. So this pollu-
tion mess touches all of us. We
want to gather with other people
to put a stop to it.”

The first step in the implemen-
tation of the program’ has been
the contacting of more than 2,000
brsiness and civic leaders in the
area by concerned people from
the four campuses. -

The six point program of the I

Institute includes organizing
speaker bureas on each campus to
provide experts in the field who
are equipped to speak on environ-
mental problems, workshops that
will involve community leaders in
analysis and presentation of the
problems, student and citizen ac-

tion groups working on specific
localized problems, leadership
and support by each college and
co-operative effort to provide pro-
grams for future use.

The prospect of a state-wide
student concern of all college and
university campuses is also being

_ considered.

Successful completion on the
Institute’s objectives, as outlin-
ed in its program, will bring about
an awareness of the problems,

ahp provide for co-operation and,

interaction between communities)
This should provide for a more ef-
fective concern for ecology in the
southwestern Pennsylvania area.

SC Committees Slate  
Fall Term Activities

by JOAN EASTBOURN

Two Student Government committees have begun working on their] ‘A
slates for the coming year. ‘ ‘ ‘ ’

The SG constitution recently underwent change to give the Pro- 
gramming Committee (PC) a new “advisory, coordinating role,” ac- ' _
cording to Chairman Bob Immanuel. “Our responsibility is to elimin—. 
ate overlap and fill in the gaps on the activities calender. By that, I 
mean, preventing different organizations scheduling several events 
for a Friday night and having nothing for Saturday night as has hap-
pened in the past.” ~ '

The Committee is in the process of formulating a calendar for the -
fall term. “We hope to coordinate things better by having organizations ‘
plan an event and come to us for a date sowe can serve more students
and they will get better attendance at their event,” Immanuel said.

. The PC will also co-sponsor activities. with other campus organ- V7‘
izations. For example, a concert is set for September 15, the weekend .
of the football game with UCLA, in conjunction with Inter-Fraternity .‘ 

 
  
  
   
  
  
  
   
   
  
 

Plans are to present three concerts per term ‘and also one good__ .;f;;-
speaker every month. The speaking engagements are scheduled during- " ‘
the day through the week to benefit the commuter students.

The SG has made the recommendation to Pangborn Film Club and '
the Student Union Board, who sponsor movies on campus, that ceiling.-5 -
rate off50 cents be charged for admittance to all films.,They hope to ‘
eliminate the confusion among students who ‘never seem to know what
the fee will be. An experiment with the‘50 cent rate will be conducted.-
first term to determine its feasibility. ‘

SG Board President Tom Bailey estimated that 20 per cent of the ' 0
student activities fees is allocated to the PC and hopes to advertise 
campus activities as supported by student activities fees so the stu- 
dents will realize the fee is being used to their benefit. I

The Homecoming Committee has nearly completed its plan for ,
Homecoming, 1972, entitled, “With Pride in Tradition.” Committee .
Chairman Sue Powell stressed the goal of the committee to initiate a ‘
rebirth of interest and participation in the festivities of “what Home-
coming should be.” u ‘

The event will begin Wednesday, Nov. 1, with the leadership din-
ner, at which the /King and Queen will be announced. The choice of. the
two will be based on achievements and contributions to the University
—much as the Pitt Woman was chosen last year.

According to Powell, it will be “no beauty contest.” The commit- 
tee decided to expand the competition this year to involve men. The 
titles “king” and “queen” have been ressurected to be in line with the 
return to tradition. ,

Thursday night a bonfire will be held at either Forbes o; Bubbles
Field and the Howdy Doody Show will provide the entertainment.
Friday will feature a float parade for which any campus organiza-

tion is invited to submit an entry to compete for cash prizes. The‘
floats will be displayed around campus for the remainder of the week-

 

_ end and at the Stadium on Saturday. —

The parade will be followed by a Keg Rolling Race sponsored by ’
Iron City Beer, to be run on Bigelow Blvd. between Forbes and Fifth
Aves. Any group may enter and send its men to participate. ’

The best eight groups will be chosen and will compete again in the
finals Saturday at the football game. The prize for the winner is a $500
scholarship fund in their name for any Pittman who demonstrates fi-
nancial need. A committee will be established to appropriate the mon-
ey. A concert is scheduled for Friday night but no group has as yet been
signed.

Saturday afternoon in the football game against West Virginia, _
followed in the evening by an open party, tentatively in the Syria 
Mosque ballroom. Sunday afternoon, Homecoming will conclude with
a concert at the Heinz Chapel by the combined voices of the Heinz Chap-
el Choir, the Men's Glee Club and the Women’s Choral. 3

MCA Tries "Project
akland ’In Community

 ~ by MARY ANNE SUTTON

 An experimental program,“‘Project Oakland,” is being sponsored
 summer session by the University YMCA in~an attempt to involve
2Qstudent volunteers in a personalized community experience.

i ‘5.We wish to assess the impact of the volunteer through aiding in

the stablization of a transitional and aging urban neighborhood,” said
0' Lew _Orient, coordinator of the new program.

base for community volunteers and a center for student-citizen inter-

"‘g- courses at the University.” '

_...For those who cannot live in the community, a house is being gen-

f “Project Oakland,” being carried out in three phases, will begin
with the expansion of presently operating community—based projects.
=Tli'ese include the Y’s LINK (recreation/enrichment groups for grade
-school children), the LINK mobile (mobile recreation and arts and
crafts program at playgrounds), and a pre-school in Oakland.

’ Additional mini projects to be sponsored are neighborhood con-
certs, construction of Tot Lot on Louisa St. and clean up of lots using
Qity trucks. E V

 The second phase of “Project Oakland” will require volunteers to
work in programs at community-based agencies such as the Family
and Children’s Service’s_Learning Disability Program and the Com-
inunity Human Services Development Corp.

 Other students will circulate on the streets and playgrounds to
' provide pick-up recreational activities for kids who have nothing to do.

, ,In an effort to determine the effectiveness of the program and the
benefits of continuing “Project Oakland” through the fall and winter
semesters, the final phase will consist of evaluation sessions with all

In Local Broailcasting

by DARLENE HARRIS

The Committee for Open Me-
dia (COM) headed by Dr. William
Hanks of the Speech Department
is presently negotiating with local
television stations in an attempt
to “provide open access” for
spokesmen representing diverse
groups and views within the com-
munity.

COM of Pittsburgh is being pat-
terned after a successful experi-
ment in » San Francisco, Calif.

‘ COM of San Francisco and station

WPIX came to an agreement
whereby community groups or
spokesman in their area were giv-
en “free air time” to air their
views on controversial issues of
community interest. '

Presently broadcast stations
are applying for license renew-
als through the FCC (Federal
Commission).
However, no application for a
broadcasting license will be
granted unless the Commission

finds that the public interest and-

convenience of the community
will be served by such a grant.

The Commission expects that
stations to show what they have
done to ascertain the problems,
needs and interests of the people
it is serving.

COM of Pittsburgh feels that
the local television stations are
not presently filling three com-
munity needs, including:

1) The need to provide com-
munity spokesmen some oppor-
tunity for free expression, some
opportunity to initiate _and edit-
their own messages on issues of
public importance;

1) The need to give issue’-ori- L

ented messages an audience ex-
posure commensurate with that

-achieved by commercial mess-

ages.

3) The need to provide access
on issues for many diverse
spokesmen, ideas and concerns,
to achieve a “natural balance” in
publicdiscussion and debate.

If COM of Pittsburgh does not
succeed in its efforts to obtain
free air time for issues of public
interest, they will file a “Petition
to Deny License Renewal’_’ against»
the stations and proceed 3from
that point.

Any group ‘or organization that
is interested in free ‘broadcast.
time to air their views on sub-
jects of public interest should con-
tact Dr. William Hanks of the
Speech Department, 11th floor,
Cathedral of Learning.

by LOIS LIBERMAN

Art faculties of area colleges
and universities were invited to
submit any two compositions to
the Three Rivers Arts Festival
this year. Seven instructors from
the University participated.

. Robert Qualters, assistant pro-
., fessor of Studio Arts, entered two
.1: compositions in the festival, each
 depicting the Medical Arts Build-
’ ing in Oakland. The smaller pre- 1
'- liminary work was completed in
water colors while the larger in
oil and acrylies.

“When I decided on the sub-'
_ . ject,” said’Qualters, “I took my
 ' supplies, over to the second floor
 - - of the building, got positioned in
 front of the grill work, and began
El painting. It took a couple months
 to complete the study and as I
 -worked, people would stop to ask
what I was doing or suggest that

I change something.”

Qualters, a

 

 

realist, usually
 works with familiar things like
} Pittsburgh’s hills, valleys, and
,v neighborhood scenes because “I
“ feel this kind of space is really

dramatic.” Over the last 6-7 years ~

Qualters has perfected his style,
, most of his compositions are fig-
E urative scenes of the ‘city. His
a style is bold, giving vitality to his
subjects.

Thomas Lacey,.assistant pro-
fessor in Art Education, works
with marble sculptural forms. At
the festival his block of shaped

"'marble, designed with sweeping
,. ‘,..clean lines is displayed’ on a stone
corner in Gateway Plaza.

The form, best viewed when.

shadows are dominant, generates
the idea of depth Lacey wants to
convey.

“When working with the rec-
tangular shape, it’s imperative
to keep the integrity of the stone.
You must stay within the stone’s
total idea and this preserves the
identity of it. Ifeel the edge is
the most important thing, th_at’s
why I try keeping untouched at
least three edges of the original
six sides of "the marble.

Able to produce three marble
sculptures yearly, Lacey said,
“It’s a slow process and once
you’ve made a decision to carve
a section of stone away, it’s gone
forever. I like working with mar-
btp though because there aren’t
many artists working in this me-
dium. Also, stone is very perma-
nent andlasts longer than ordin-
ary sculptures of metal or ce-
ramic.”

Lacey gets the piece of marble
"in a rectangular cut quarry state.
He then chips away roughing in

the shape with a rasp. Finally, he’

rubs the stone with carborundum
paper and polishes it to'a natural
transluscence. ‘

The disadvantage to Lacey’s
work is its location on a roped off
wall in the Plaza. Viewed from a
distance where only one side can
be seen, the beauty is difficult to
capture. However, unlike other
crowded displays like the ceram-
ics or crafts, Lacey’s sculpture

has adequate empty space sur-
rounding it giving an uncluttered
view.

Barbara Fredette, also an as-
sistant professor of Art Educa-
tion, has a small mixed media
composition in the faculty exhibit.
The focal point or dominant cir-
cular area resembles the pupil or
iris of an eye and the entire small-
scale work is black on white.

Not only is Fredette displaying
in the invited exhibit, but her
work was also judged and two en-
tries were accepted in the photo-
graphy exhibit. One, particulary
serene, is entitled “Pound Ridge
Winter” done in deep brown tones.

The chairman of the Studio Arts
Department, Ming Fay’s entries
are air-brush compositions. The
clou‘d—like gray color is complete-
ly abstract and on close examina-
tion, the sprayed color has an add-
ed third dimension enveloping the
viewer.

In contrast, ‘instlructor David
Keeton is a more geometric artist.
His displays are compositions de-
veloped on graph paper. Blocks

‘are outlined in pencil designed
» from the grid pattern. Distorted

regular graph designs are also
created by connecting various

' rows of the graph lines across the

page creating a wavy motion.

Ins-tructor Edward Powell has
entered two color lithographs in -.
the exhibit. Both utilize deep col-
ors, one pink, the other yellow;
both incorporate black. One titled

“Day Dreamer” has a mysterious '

quality. The subject is a female
lying down and the view is from
the top of the head. Many arms
are in the composition and from
their multiple view, a slow motion
effect is created. The hands are
claw-like in appearance. ‘

All artists in the festival show
a variety of techniques from real-
ist to abstract and structured to
unstructured. Each artist in the
department complimehts the
others with a unique style.

Old folks--you know the story:
staid, listless, gray; no longer
people, recognized instead as part
of a Problem. Such a comfortable
stereotype; a wonder that it has
had so little influence on Tom
Spinella.

Spinella_plays Mr. Crepe in the
University Theater’s current pro-
duction of John Arden’s Happy
Haven. As drawn by Arden, Crepe

-is a long nosed cynical old man.
As played by Spinella, Crepe sees
to it that the message implied by
Arden’s tale of five old loonies in
a rest home reaches the audience.

Happy Haven marks the third
time Spinella’s convincing por-
trayal of an old man has made an
important contribution to a pro-
duction’s success.

Spinella’s performance as a
moth-balled old Shakespearean
trouper very nearly stole the
show during this fall’s production
of The Fantasticks in the Studio
Theater. He won still more ap-

 “Happy Home’ Star Portrays

of Lane, the stooped and shuffling
manservant of Algernon Mon-
creiff, in the Greensburg campus’
production of The Importance of
Being Ernest.

His Greensburg appearance was
something of a homecoming for
Spinella. He attended the Greens-
burg campus for two years before
enrolling in the Theater Arts De-
par ment here in Oakland.

Spinella’s stage credits include
A Midsummer Night’s Dream,
We Bombed in New Haven, Anti-
gone, and other shows in addition
to The Fantasticks and The Im-
portance of Being Ernest.

“What distinguishes Happy Hav-
en from all the others,” he ex-
plained during a recent interview,
“is the extent to which this pro-
duction is deliberately tailored to
the message of the play.

“It’s quite a challenge to create
a believable characterization in
this production, what with the
masks and all the other broad
hints about the characters’ per-
s_o_n_alitie_s_ built into the show,”

Spinella added.

“I asked costume designer Lynn
Hemmingway to create masks for
the old people modeled after the
animals suggested by their per-
sonalities,” explained director
David Rinear. “Set designer Hen-
ry Heymann and music composer
Frank McCarty helped create the
atmosphere of an institutionalized
Mighty Mouse cartoon that I felt
was most appropriate for the an-.
tics that go on in the Happy Hav-
en.”

“We’ve been rehearsing from
about seven until 11 in the eve-
ning _for five weeks now,” said
Spinella on opening night. “And
rehearsals hardly tell the whole

story—I spent two hours last‘

night with Lynn Hemmingway
rummaging through second hand
series looking for a sweater to
match my costume.”

“A lot of additional time is
spent researching a role. I found
out that as Mr. Crepe I was to
wear a weasel’s mask, so I read
up on weasels. Their name means
‘little killers’; they’re ruthless
and deadly-——that‘ told me a lot
about Mr. Crepe.”

Asked what he as an actor felt
about the play and his part in it,
Spinella replied, “I hope my per-

all that.”

Hockey Team
Defeats Two

The Pitt hockey team upped its
record to 5-2-0 with victories last
week over Duquesne and the Billi-
kens. The team remains in third
place in the Alpine Summer
League.

The team had little trouble in
either game, with victories of 7-1
over the Dukes and 10-2 over
the Billikens. Bill Glanville led all
scorers in the Duquesne game
with four goals.

In the Billikens game, Greg
Carroll scored the three goal hat
trick, while Jim Richter, Phil
Clark, and Rick Baginski all con-
tributed two tallies apiece. Denny
Browne finished the scoring with
one lamplighter.

Mark Lieberman again played
shutout goaltending, then yielded
to backup netminder Larry Toom-
ey who let in only two goals in the
second half of the game.

The team returns to action to-
night at 7 when they face the War-
riors. The next action after that
will be a return match with the
Blues Tuesday night. In their last
meeting Pitt won easily, 4';-1.
