Coal Strike Forces Heat Supply Cut;

B)’ 303 THOMAS

The University is 40 per cent cooler inside due to the coal
strike. According to Elmer A. Halvorson, heating engineer in the
buildings and grounds department Pitt heating facilities are oper-
K ating at only 60 per cent of normal.
Bellefield Boiler Plant officials, however, maintain that in

spite of the cut in steam to Pitt

buildings there is a little danger
at the present time of heat being
cut completely. Consequently
school is not going to close.

‘The boiler plant supplies high
pressure live steam to many of the
buildings in the Oakland area as
well as to Pitt. Some of them have
not been so fortunate. Boiler plant
officials revealed that steam is no
longer being fed to Phipps Conserv-
atory or to a major part of the Car-
negie Museum.

In the museum building only the
libraries and the special exhibits
are gemaining open while in neigh-
boring Mellon Institute heat has
been curtailed.

On Wednesday a rumor was cir-
culated that the Institute had closed
to waitvout the coal strike. A quick
check revealed, however, that Mel-
lon personnel were only taking the
day off to celebrate Washington’s
birthday.

The Duquesne Light Company,
also, is limping along on available

supplies of low-grade coal. The
company has asked commercial
and industrial electric users to

voluntarily cut daylight electricity
consumption 20 per cent. Pitt is
included in this category.

Halvorson, buildings and grounds
heating engineer,_says that he is
trying to keep all classrooms as
near as possible to a 70 degree
temperature.

MC Elects

  New Members

Four new men joined the ranks of
Men's Council last Tuesday bring-
ing the membership up to the regu-
lation number oftwenty for the first
time in several weeks.

The new members are Jack Pett-

‘let, a Bus Ad senior, Elidio Mono-
riti and Paul Hein, Engineering
seniors, and Bernard Ivanschultz,
a Pharmacy sophomore.

Council parliamentarians, how-
ever, were unable to establish com-
pletely the legality of Ivanschultz’s
election, because the MC consti-
tution requires that a junior or senior
represent the School of Pharmacy.

Bill Blockstein, who held the
Pharmacy membership fprmerly,had
been asked to recommend a succes-
sor to himself. He could not, how-
ever, recommend a senior or junior,
since those classes are on block
schedules which interfere with the
time for Council meetings.

Therefore Blockstein recommen-
ded Ivanschultz, a sophomore, and
Council, temporarily ‘ accepting
Blockstein’s choice, has appointed
him to a provisional non-voting
membership.

Council also filled the vacated
position of Vice-President by elec-
ting Joe Wolfe, chairman of the
customs and traditions committee,
to that post.

Wolfe was asked to comment on
the customs program ‘thus far. Com-
plaining of the marked scarcity of
diqks around school, he said that
he wouldpersonally visit orientation
classes to make sure the freshman
comply with the dink-wearing edict.

Another development oflast Tues-
day's meeting was the selection of
Roy Nelson to attend a conference
next week in Philadelphia, which
will concern the operation of col-
lege student centers. J,

Deadlocked

Llators

A deadlock over conflicting elec-
tion procedures between Siudent
Congress and WSGA was momen-
tarily by-passed Monday after an
hour's discussion failed to produce
any compromise that could be put
into effect in time for spring elec-
tions, scheduled for sometime early
in May.

The discussion followed a report
by Betty Bolger,president of WSGA
and ex-officio member of Congress.
Miss Bolger outlined the election
set-up worked out by WSGA over the
past three months, then asked Con-
gress to do something about a con-
flicting clause in the latters con-
stitution.

Deadlock Results

The deadlock arose as a result
of WSGA’s insistence that women
nominated for more than one major
position be given a chance to choose
the office they desire to run for.
The women's clearing house held
to effect this policy does not me et
until after Congress’ two-Week
deadline for’ nominees’ petitions,
so that women runningfor Congress
do not ordinarily have a chance to
discoverifthey have received other
nominations. I

Solution Offered

The conflict was solved, at least
for this »year's~elections, by Dick
Kovar’s motion that the elections
be handled by the same method
used last year, when the same in-
compatibility existed. It would in-
volve a special women's Congres-
sional nominating committee who
would contact nominees privately,
the nominations to be kept secret
until afterthe clearing house meets.

Matt Cvetic

Names Pitt
Professor

The name of Dr. Marion Hathway,
professor of public welfare in the
School of Social Work, has been
placed on the list of those men-
tioned by Matt Cvetic, former FBI
agent now testifying before a Con-
gressional committee. '

Dr. Hathway, when reached by
the News, did not wish to offer
comment.

In his testimony before the House
Un-American Activities Committee
the ex-FBI man, who posed as a
Communist leader for nine years,
associated her with several"red-
tinted” organizations. He said
specifically, however, that he had
no information that Dr. Hathway
was a member of the Communist
party.

In May, 1949, Dr. Hathway was
attacked by Judge of County Coirt
Blair Gunther for her political ac-
tivities. At that timeJudge Gunther
said that Dr. Hathway “should be
dismissed?’ for her left wing lean-
ings “but we have not had the
courage in Pittsburgh to do that.”

After Judge Gunther’s attack a
group of the woman professor's stu-
dents banded together to support

her, saying that. “her political
views never entered into” -her
classwork.

According to Cvetic, Dr. Hath-
_way was associated with the fol-
lowing groups: member, National
Wallace-for-President Committee;
delegate and speaker at the 1948
Wallace convention; sponsor, Com-
mittee of Welcome for the "Red
Dean” of Canterbury; and sponsor
for the Pennsylvania Wallace Com-
mittee.

Also mentioned by Cvetic was
Evelyn Abelson, identified as a
Pitt student. No confirmation of
her Pitt affiliation has been re-
leased.

Listed as the‘former chairman
of the Pitt Young Progressives and
the current regional organizer for
the Young Progressives of Penn-
sylvania was a Bobby Jones, also
identified as a Pitt student.

Among many others, Cvetic
named William Albertson as Com-
munist Party secretary for Western
Pennsylvania. lie was expelled
from Pitt in 1929 for his radical

of atomic warfare .

WORLD FEDERALlST—Dr. David Bradley warns audience of effects

‘No Place to Hide’ Wfarns

Atomic Bomb seer

 
   

By DAVE WINTER

Dr» David Bradley, a soft-voiced young man who speaks calmly
of the deaths of210,000 people and 3,000 square miles of chaos,
told a sober Foster Hall audience Wednesday that there is “No
Place to Hide” from the effects of atomic warfare.

Bradley wants the U.S. to take the lead in forming a world

government. He believes that we
cannot expect leadership in inter-
national relations from Washington.

Secretary of Defense Louis John-
ston regards the possibility of a
third world war so lightly that he
used "sandlo; language” while
talking about it recently, according
to Bradley.

He quoted the head of the U.S.
Armed Forces as saying, “If Joe
wants to fight, we'll beat hell out
of him.”

Talks with Students

Bradley talked infiarmally with
students and faculty members at
the Blennd.

A tall, well-mannered graduate of
Princeton Medical School, Bradley
was a radiologist at the Bikini
A-bomb experiment. He was one of
the first two men to enter the area
after the explosion,risking possible
ill effects
still present.

Hopes to Avoid War

Serious and sincere in his hope
that we can avoid war, he spoke
without passion about the H-bomb’s
10 mile radius of destruction, and
the modern concept of war-"One
bomb,one city.”

At the Blennd, a Pitt debate:
asked the lecturer for answers to
two questions as Bradley was pre-

Whether Pitt: will have a student

center in Grace Reformed Church
still remains undecided.

The dean of men, the dean of
women, and three representatives
of the Student Christian Federation
met yesterday morning to decide
what the position of the University
would be in regard to the center and
what would be expected of the Uni-
versity in the event a center is
established at the Church.

The deans were undecided on
two major points, according to Dick
Campbell, chairman of the SCF ex-
ecutive council sponsoring the
center.

They said that an inspectionof
the facilities would have to be made
and a workable system of super-’

, vision effe cted.

Deans Theodore W- Biddle and

  

Helen, Pool Rush therefore decided

to inspect the center at Bayard and.

of supervision, the SCF had tenta-

This morning the pastors are con-
ferring on a system of rotating the

Idea Not New

The idea of establishing a stu-
dent center in the Grace Church
has been alive since the end of
last semester. The church trustees,
feeling that their largely unused
facilities could be put to a bene-
ficial purpose, approached the ex-
ecutive committee of the Student
Christian Federation with the
idea that Pitt students might use
a wing of the church for meetings,
recreation, and special events.’

An agreement between the church
and the Federation was concluded
but University approval must fol-
low before a center can be estab-
lished.

Campbell has said, "The Uni-
versity is altogether right in pro-
cedeing cautiously. Plenty of
people are involved, and things
can’: be rushed through. I am con-
fident, though, that we will be

"careful to point out, however, that Cvetic said he had no evidence

“These, among other things, must presumably be considered in

J Howfar can the "freedom of thought and expression” go in a

situation involving leftish tendencies contrary to our basic Amer-

indictment strong enough alone to warrant action?

Would public knowledge of the presence of a figure, no matter

how minor, appearing in this sensational case be damaging to the

O prestige of the University, internally as well as externally?

All around the campus it’s being felt, as places like the Car-
negie Museum and Phipps Conservatory are shutting down almost
‘completely. And the heat shortage has begun to filter in on the
campus proper. Cutbacks this week have dropped the heat through-
out the Cathedral to 60 percent of normal.

The students are watching all this with mixed emotions. The
"question in most of their minds is, "Is it going to get so bad that

Congress Report

As a public service requested by

.Student Congress, the News pre-

sents in capsulized form a rundown‘

‘report of their/first semester’s ac-

tivities. This is quoted exactly in
its abbreviated form ‘from the report
of President Flora Diemeft’. '

"To the Student Body:
"In order to familarize more mem-
bers of the Student Body with their

governing body, Student Congress,-

we submit this report of our acti-
vities from the time we took office
on May 1, 1949, to the conclusion
of the past semester.

"In order ‘to facilitate reading
and to provide a chronological
order, this report is prepared and
presented in minute form.”

A report of the Assemblies com-
mittee and its sub—committees, ap-
pointments, social, and publicity,
followed, each citing hard work
done by each.

The treasurer’s report states
“Don Wilde has worried over our
budget of $1900, which must cover
all Congress expenses. The ap-
propriation is divided into two
parts: $600 for an assembly pro-
gram, and $1300 for all other Stu-
dent Congress expenses.”

Dave Fox’ assemblies committee
presided over two pep rallies and
two victory celebrations.

"The attendance averaged 3000
people. The favorable attendance
figures were made possible by the
five free hours from classes grant-
ed by the Board of Deans. The as-
semblies committee prepared this
petition and saw it granted for the
most part for the school year 1949-
1950.”

Reference was also made to this
group’s work on assemblies. "Col.
M. Thomas Tchow ...i spoke to a
small audience in Stephen Foster
Memorial.” Plans are being made

’for two more speakers and a free

film program.

In the President's report, Miss
Diemert states, “Student Congress
this year has been busy and has
accomplished a lot  I will con-
fine my report to some of the major

ssues.

"The

block was backed by Student Con-

gress this Fall. The. block proved

to be a success with the exception
of a few minor points  Congress
will decide whether or not it wishes
to continue to back the block next

"The dance (High School Coke

huge success and we strongly re-
commend that a similar affair be
held annually.

“The Student Faculty Relations

of student faculty blennds  to
foster closer relationships between
faculty and students.

"The blennds were small "in-
vitation only” events in order that
the guests might have ample op-
portunity to, know each other. A
small invitation in the Pitt News
did not have a successful reception
 there will be an attempt to im-
prove our future blennds.

"This year (we helped sponsor)

a special student rate train trip
to Philadelphia for the Penn foot-
ball game. Unfortunately due to
the lack of studentjintereist it ‘was

necessary to cancel the reduced
rate.” ‘

“The Pitt Chest Drive was not
a complete success this Fall. Be-
cause the total raised fell below
the goal set  the Council is plan-
ning to raise money in the Spring‘

Miss Diemert then
other projects Congress

She concludes, "Our primary
purpose is to ascertainand express
student opinion. Student Congress
meetings are open to the Student

students visited us. The members
of Congress join me in inviting
you to our meetings. Come and
give your opinion; we need it.”

Groups
Organized
Since Fall

53)’ LEN 7}/‘KER

Far from requiring any organiza-
tional help from Student Congress
(as claimed by congressman Don
Ewart) Pitt’_s independents already
have two groups designed for the
non-fraternity student, both ofwhich
have existed since last fall.

Since October the. Executive
Council of the old Pitt Independent
Association has been meeting to
lay plans for this semester. They
wanted to have a definite plan bf
organization before taking any ac-
tion, according to President George
W. Kimmel.

The PIA now hasaa faculty ad-
visor, Lewis W. Rathgeber of the
history department and has evolved
a definite statement of policy.

The organization is "designed
to integrate the (non-fraternity) stu-
dent into the social, cultural and
political life of the University,"
according to Kimmel.

Executive Council does not in-
tend that politics become their only
object but it also feels that it is
“foolish to create an artificial va-
cuumin political activity when they
‘were attempting to fill vacuums in
social and cultural activities.”

Concurrent with the rebirth of

the old PIA another independent-

group was also organized. This
group includes a membership of
about 30 freshmen, "with only a
small percentage really interested,”
according to Jack Markkwitz, one
of the organizers. '

"Our greatest problem,” Marko-
wirz’added, “has been simply get-
ting enough interested students.”

Both of these embryonic groups
have planned a social program for
-the coming semester. The PIA is
also planning a large membership
drive whereasithe freshmen group
is contemplating only a small 01"
ganization.

A quick glance at their prospec-
tus for this semester shows a busy
time in the offing for members of

V the Women’s Speech Association.

In . the immediate future, the
women debaters will participate in
a debate at Mt. Mercy college Feb.
25. In the same week, three girls
from Women’s Debate will meet
three male members of the Penn
State debatingteam Feb. 28 and
March I, the women debators will
meet women members of the Penn

chance to participate in many acti-
vities. The meeting of March 2 will
consist of a voice analysis session
to which all old and new members
are invited, according to Reva
Parish,president ofthe association.

Other plans for the future include
participation in a "Pathways to
Progress” radio program on thesub-
ject of Career Women vs. Non-car-
eer Wofnen, and in a POCUY festival
to be held at Penn State in May.

Chairman Jim Johnson telegraphed
a special invitation to the dance to
new Pitt head coach Len Casanova.
In his reply Casanova telegraphed
that he would attend “Chinatown”
if at all possible. He signed his
message "Newest Freshman.”

The Hemi-Demi-Semi Quavers

lfare state in a debate with Pitt
from the University of Glasgow,
ical intern from the University of

Edinburgh, spoke affirmatively on
the question "Is Liberty Threaten-
ed by the Welfare State?” '1 be de-
bate was sponsored jointly by the

Men's Debating Associatibn and
the English-Speaking Union of Pitts-
burgh. " .

* Powerful Arguments

In the first international debate
at Pitt since 1937, Reid and Web-
ster-Low presented powerful and
detailed arguments for the welfare
state as practised in Britain. They
contrasted sharply with the more
theoretical evidence piled up by
Blackstone and Rhodes on the side
of government non-intervention in
its citizen’s life.

Blackstone, former president of
the Pitt Men's Debaters, delivered
the first Pitt speech. In it he out-
lined the main objections against
the welfare state.

Boiled down they amounted to
the facts that too much government
violated the rights of a citizen "to
be left alone;’’ and that the welfare
state does away with private lib-
erty through its restrictions -- even
though made for the common wel-
fare. *

Welfare State Defined

Webster-Low on the other side of
the platform defined the welfare state
in the terms of "men and women
wherever they are born are entitled
to a full share of happiness.” Mat-
erial goods are distributed on the
basis of need rather than purchas-
ing power.

Reid, in his final rebuttal, main-
tained that the welfare state is a

the developement of government. It

is already present in American, he

said, but not in an advanced form.

The debate was marked by the
sharp wit of the two Scots. No de-
cision was rendered on the outcome.

Late Panther  
Due March 1

The next issue of the Panther
Magazine will,reportedl-y, be well
worth the wairincurred by the lack
of the scheduled Feb. 20 issue.

The March 1 issue will be done
as a parody on a national magazine,
and, according to Don Horowitz,
managing editor, will be in the best
issue yet.

Besides many of its own stand-
ard favorites, such as Campus
Candids, the Panther will carry an
“expose” of Pitt’s fraternity sys-
tem, and “the truth” about Rita
and Aly.

For TV followers, thereiwill be
some lowdown on Rex Peery’s Pitt
wrestlers. Another new feature, ex-
pected to be a big hit, will be the
Picture of the Week.

Dave Pettler, advertising manager,
says he is going to put his business
copies of she Panther into a vault
to pfevent the oversale of them
which forced a double-your-money-
back offer for the return of the Oct-
ober issue. -

PITT’S SEISMOLOGICAL OB-
servatory, or earthquake recording
department, is located in the base-
ment of the Cathedral. It maintains
three detectors placed on a pier
of concrete sunk to bedrock, which

Chairs Soft Anyway
Probably trying to compensate
in some small may for the pain he
inflicted, the early dentist made
an attempt to offer his patient a
comfortable chair.The padded chair
pictured was one of the original
I chairs designed for use in the den-
tist’s office.
It was built about 1865 and fea-
tured a nice homey look effected
by ‘velvet upholstery and a fringe
around the bottom to please the
feminine patients. For the men,
‘there was a fancy brass cuspidor
was a necessary item but often it
served the dentist too, masticating
a plug of tobacco during the oper-
ation to soothe his nerves.
The other chair came along about
1892 and was considered a great
improvement because it allowed for

reclining the patient to an almost
horizontal position. This was in-
deed a great improvement because
it it made escape rather difficult for

the sufferer, especially when the
dentist got a knee firmly implanted
in the patient’s mid-section.

Difficult Dentures
Looking back to the days of our
country’s beginning, we must gasp
in wonderment that ourheroes could
have made such glorious history
aiwhile grappling with those crude
A pdengures. But the man who could
fmaster the art of keeping those
plates inside his mouth must have
had determination.

hazardly in place by the two long

Series of
Six Movies

Celluloids have currently
placed live talent at Pitt.
Student Congress is sponsoring a
series of six motion pictures to be
Shown at Stephen Foster starting
March 1.

Congress feels that the movies
will provide more interesting assem-
blies since they have had varying
results with speakers.

The movies which will be shown
and the time of the showing is as
follows: Othello, 1:30-2:30 Wed.,
March 1; Mr. Deeds Goes to Town,
12:30-2:30 Wed., March 0; Life of
Pasteur, 2:30-3:30 Thurs., March
23; Thirty-nine Steps, 3:30-5:30
Thurs., March 30; Tale of Two Ci-
ties, *1:30-2:30 Fri., April 28; No-
thing Sacred, 11:30-1:30 Wed., May
10.

The movie schedule has been
planned so that it won’t conflict «
with any other activity on the sched-
ule. The innovation will become
"a permanent fixture if it works,”
according to Dave Fox.

Othello, Life of Pasteur, and
Tale of Two Cities have been edi-
ted but the other three will appear
in their original form.

The movies, which are free, were
plannedon different days and hours
so that as many students as pos-
sible can have the opportunity *0
see them.

The films were obtained from the
P.C.W. film library and the Clem
Williams agency and are 16 milli-
meters in black and white. .

Announcements will be placed
on the Bulletin Board and printed
schedules will be available at Stu-
dent Deek, Men’s Council Book
Store and the Ellsworth Center
office.

Don Horowitz will be the pro-
jector for the movies and Pat Liex.
Jack Schano, and Justine Regan

will handle the publicity.

 

IT'S A DATE —-Cadet Major James Lauble, chairman of the Military
Ball Committee, makes the Match 24 date official by signing the con-
tract for West View Danceland. Handing him the pen is George Haron III,
president of West View Park (seated).

Spivak at,West View

It is now official. All the necessary contracts have been signed
to have the Military Ball at West View’s Danceland Ballroom. The
paperwork was completed late last week.

Included in the contract are free parking and free checking fa-
plilities. Tables willalso be provided in the area around the dance

oor.

Additional personnel will be em-
ployed to facilitate quick parking
and checking.

James Lauble, chairman of the
Ball, said that arrangements have
also been completed with Balfour’s

to obtain practical as well as beau-
tiful favors for the cadets’ dates.

In ordinary life, “an ace in the hole” means money in

Sigma Chi

A In Playoffs

By BORE WE INSTEIN

Delta Sigma Pl1i’s bid for a play-
off berth in the Section 1 fraternity
race was stymied Monday night as
the Sigma Chi quintet rolled to an
impressive 35-27 victory.

The victory at Trees Gym assures
Sigma Chi of a playoff position
and a possiblechance to win the
interfraternity trophy. The other
playoff berth was filled by the Phi
Kaps, who embarrassed the Sigma
phis, 42-28.The after season games
are due to start next week.

Leading by a field goal, 17-15:
at the intermission, the Sweethearts
wheeled away in the second half,
out-scoring their opponents, 18-12.

Cliff Sinewe and the Delts trail-
ed by one point at the quarter,keep-
ing pace with the Sigma Chi till
the half. But at this point Sinewe
was stopped and so were the Delts.

Ted Kottraba and Walt Bielich
tallied eight points each for the
Chis, while Sinewe pitched 15
points thropgh the nets for the

Green Wave.

Wisemen Win

The YMCA bounced back on to
the winning trail and into the play-
offs last Tuesday evening at the
Stadium as they defeated Ellsworth
Center, 30-21.

The game saw the Yi'pass,dribble,
and shoot their way to this nine
point victory which decided who
was to represent the National
League in the playoffs.

This well balancedvgame saw
both teams playing a_ smooth, fast
type of ball as well as preventing
each other from scoring and thus
causing the first half to end with
a comparatively low 14-10 score,
Y on top.

A surge was then made by the Y
team, but Ellsworth was not sleep-
ing andmanaged to keep themselves
within eight points of the lead at
theend of thg third stanza.

Even—steven ball was played
throughout the rest of the game.
With the defense of both teams

again shining, the Y outscored the
Ellsworth boys only six points to
five in the last quarter.

Home Finale for Cagers  

3)’ WILL DOERGE

Any hopes the Pitt basketball five entertains of breaking into
the victory column once more this season hinge on tomorrow night’s
home finale with the West Virginia Mountaineers at the Stadium.

The Panthers dropped their sixth straight game Wednesday to
Carnegie Tech at the Skibo gym, 66-59, bringing their season re-
cord to a dismal.3 wins and 13 losses.

Doc Carlson feels that there is no reason why his team can't
lick the Mounties if the officiating is halfways decent. West Vir-
ginia has been no great shakes as a team this season as compared
with previous years,being barely over the .500 mark withsan 11-10

I Don’t Like Being Called

Liar -- Tom Hamilton

Athletic Director Tom Hamilton has lashed back at Aldo(Buff) Donelli,
"Boston U football coach, in the latest battle of their verbal war.
Earlier this week Donelli accused Hamilton of being a double crosser,

thus adding an additional touch to
his previous insinuation that Ham-
ilton was a liar. "I am not going to
answer any more_questions on this
matter," Hamilton told the News,
“as I do not see any constructive
purpose in keeping this argument
going.

"At the same time, however, I

 

I? amilton D onel li

do not like being called a liar."

Hamilton then issued a terse for-
mal statement to the press to sum
the matter up: “The facts in this
case are evident to anyone inter-
ested in reviewing them.”

The facts to which he referred
run like this:

(1) Prior to the selection of Len
Casanova as head coach, Donelli
phoned Hamilton to talk about the

job. When questioned by reporters,
Hamilton admitted this.

(2) Donelli next day denied ever
having phoned, Hamilton.

(3) Donelli this week admitted he
called but said that Hamilton was
to have kept the conversation con-
fidential, and that he, Donelli, did
not apply for the job.

ce Rutgers

In Big Meet of Year

By STAN SKIRBOLL
The schedule makers saved the best for last when they slated
Rutgers as the wind up for the swimming team’s dual meet card.
The tankers will journey to New Brunswick Saturday in what
will probably be the toughest dual meet test of the past several

years.

The Rutgers team is the Eastern
Collegiate champion, a title the
Pitt team has its eye on this year.

Pitt Underdogs

Coach Ben Grady’s boys, although
underdogs, could easily upset the
dope and defeat the rugged Rut-
get team. The comparative ease
with which the Panther team drown-
ed Penn State gives evidence that
the Panthers are among the top
swimming teams.

A win over Rutgers will substa-
tiate this evidence.

Rutgers will also be the only
obstacle for an undefeated record.
Wednesday the Pitt team went to
Mt. Vernon, Ohio, to swamp Ken-
yon, 54-21.

New Pool Record

The Pitt mermen took all nine
first places, with their 400-yard
relay team setting a new pool re
cord. The relay team, composed
of Jules Melograne, John Peterson,
Jim Zentgraf, and Dick Petro ‘clip-
ped 6.5 seconds off A nine-year old
record.

Evidently out to save both Petro
and Zentgraf for the relay, Grady
entered his two stars in only one
event each.

Track Team

In IC4A’s

A four-man mile relay team and
two hurdlers will be the official
Panther entries in the indoor IC4A
meet at New York this Saturday.

Selection of the fourth man for
the mile relay squad was completed
Wednesday, following tryouts con-
ducted by Coach Carl Olson at the
Panther’s Schoonmaker Hall prac-
tice grounds. Dick Plummer quali-
fied to move into the starting line-
up of Johnny Kountz, Dick Firshling,
and Len Henry.

A newcomer to the indoor track
season at Pitt, Richard Lindley, a
transfer from Geneva College, will
team with Bob McKowen in the low
and high hurdles. Both men are sen-
iors.

Mount Union College has been
scheduled to meet Pitt in a dual
meet at Schoonmaker Hall, South
Side,‘ on March 4. Following this
in quick succession for the Pan-
thers will be the indoor AMA-AAU
junior and senior meets, set for
March 11 and 25 respectively.

Frosh Game at 6:45

Preceding the 8:15 Pitt-West
Virginia contest,the top-notch frosh
teams of both schools meet in the
prelim at 6:45.Pitt’sfreshmen laced
the Tech Jayvees Wednesday, 75-33,
for their seventh victory in nine
starts.

The Pattonmen still feature such
familiar faces as Eddie Beach
(6-4), tip-in specialist, Joe Duff
(5-10), and Eddie Sterling (6-1).
Sophomore Mark Workman (6-8), lead-
ing scorer for the Mounties, is the
outstanding addition to their ranks.

Their coach, Lee Patton, will
not be with the team tomorrow night.
Patton was badly injured in an.auto-
crash last week on his way to Penn
State. .

Panthers Stage Comeback

Against the Tartans, Pitt staged

an amazing comeback in the final

half after trailing at one point,
46-24.Sparked bythe great shooting
of George McCrossin, Pitt whittled
away Tech’s lead until they trailed
by only two points, 56-54, with
2:45 of the game remaining.

“We could have beaten Tech if
it hadn’t been for the poor officiat-
ing,”' said Carlson. "Our boys
really found themselves in the sec-
cond half but the officials took
the game away from them. When a
team scores five more field goals
and still loses by seven points, it
speaks very poorly for the offici-
ating.”

The officials, Harry Capps and
Pete Gallo, called 53 personals,
32 on the Panthers. Tech counted
30 of 40 foul attempts which sewed ,
up the game for them.

Negligible Contact?

Capps called two technical fouls
on Carlson in the final two minutes
"I stilldon’t knowwhyCapps called
the first foul. He was standing in
front of me while play was going
on, and I made negligible contact
with him.

"He called the technical and I
blew my top, so he called another
onef’

After Bimbo Cecconi fouled out
soon after Pitt had closed the gap.
Tech pulled ahead to stay. Mc-
Crossin and Geroge Hromanik also
bowed out via personals.

for Henrys.

Henrys Doomed

I know of only one he-man who
never made bones about being tag-
ged Henry, and that personwas Bill
Thackeray’s Henry Esmond, who
used to chase around fighting duels
and such in seventeenth’ century
literature. But in those days a body
could get away with Robin, Loch-
invar, or even Horatio.

Times, however, have changed.

Nowadays, Henry should be stamp-
ed only on those who are doomed to
be shri mps’ or professors. If a man
is to make his way in the world of
sports where brawn and muscle pre-
vail, Henry will hardly do.

Still, here is this fellow Carlson
rising to the top. It must prove that
capitalism is not dead yet.

Versatility could well be Frank
Christopher's middle name the way
the 18-year old lad gets around from
one sport to another. 7 -4

Frank‘ is currently participating
for Bobby Artman’s freshman basket-
ball squad, but he is just as much
at home in a track suit or football
,togs as in a basketball uniform.
‘From one sport to another is the
trail that this 6-2, 180-pound lad
cuts, and enjoys doing so, too.

In a few more weeks he’ll be try-
ing to land a spot on Carl Olson’s
track team -— a busy schedule for
any athlete.

No Stranger Here

Chris is no stranger to the Sta-
dium floor. He was a regular center
for the Brentwood Spartans basket-
ball team, winners of Section 5 of
the WPIAL the past two years. As
a resulthe has played on the Pitt
COUIT foul? times before this year.
In his junior year he was the team’s
scorer, and last year he
missed the top rung by only ten
points.

In football Frank held down the
regular right end post for the Spar-
tan eleven. He was a fixture at the
terminal for three years.

Brother War

But track is the sport that he
really enjoys. Like his brother
Dave, Chris is also a discus throw-
er, but he has taken more to the
broad jump and high jump. He holds
the Brentwood High School record
of 6-13/4 for the high jump, a mark
set last year.

It will be interesting to see how
Frank fares against his brother in
the discus throw later in“the spring.

Pitt Bowlers
Meet Monday

Bowlers interested in signing up
for the ten pin team that is to re-
present Pitt in the Western Inter-
collegiate Tournament next month
at Erie should meet at the Univer-
sity Alleys at Craig and Forbes
streets on Monday, Feb. 27.

IM Director Leo C. Bemis re-
quests that candidates be at the
Alleys at 3:30 or 4:30.p.m.

Pitt's new head football coach,
Len Casanova, was settled in his
local office this morning after fin-
ally arriving in Pittsburgh from the
West Coast yesterday afternoon.

The ex-Santa Clara boss came in
by plane shortly after noon and was
driven to the University Athletic
Administration Building where he
faced more than a dozen newspaper
and radio reporters.

There, he revealed that if he has
sufficient material’ he may install
the two-platoon system here. How-
ever, the platoons would not be
separate offensive and defensive
teams but rather, fixed units oper-
ating in both aspects of the game.

Likes Speed
"I like speed on «defense as well
as offense,”he explained. Thus, he
seems to prefer fast ball carriers

opposition is running the plays,

such a system at Santa Clara. ..

Clad impecably in a gray business
suit and maroon tie, the gray-haired
coach went through "the paces in a
soft-spoken yet willing, manner.

Queried as to why he left a se-
cure position at Santa Clara, he
replied, “This is a fine opportunity
and a challenge for me here. The
schedule is a more representative
one.”

Hesitant Once
He said that he presently is con-
templating bringing no assistant
coaches in from outside the district
-- that is, aside from Line Coach

-Herm Meister and Backfield Coach

Jack Roche, who have already been

appointed as aides.
Casanova hesitated

asked whether

Unique Faculty Club V

By LEO MOSS

The swankiest suite of rooms in the Cathedral is the exclusive.

property of P-itt’s faculty.

For a number of years the Faculty Club has had its quarters‘ if ,
on the seventeenth floor in the splendor of rooms decorated by: 
Gustav Ketterer, the famous decorator of many government build-

ings in Washington.

But the organization could not
always boast of such luxury. At its
beginning there were only a few
members who met for lunch at a
house in Oakland where bachelor
members of the faculty roomed.

From this beginning the club
built up a membership of 600 that
meets, ears, and talks in their own
exclusive club rooms.

As stated in their constitution
the purpose of the Faculty Club is
to promote fellowship. Members can
spend their. leisure hours here talk-
ing over their ideas‘ with fellow
faculty members. They hold numer-
ous social events during the year
including dances, cardoparties, and
picnics.

They sponsor volleyball and bowl-
ing leagues, and they support their
own kitchen for luncheons and ban-
quets at no profit, charging the’
members only the cost of preparing
the meals.

Each year there is a reception
and dance sponsored jointly by the
Women’s Association and the Fac-
ulty Club honoring the new members.

For all this the members pay
only $10 a year plus their luncheon
expenses.

The organization of the club is
unique among groups of its kind.
In addition to a president, vice-
president, secretary, and treasurer,
elected annually, there is aboard
of governors elected, consisting of
committee chairman and the past
president to manage the clubs pro-
perty and affairs. The entire group
meets once a year and at any other
time the president thinks necessary.

So while the students struggle
for students centers and indepen-
dent organizations, the faculty has
solved for itself the same problem.

Dept. Head  

Recuperates

Dr. Walter R. Hovey, head of the
fine arts department, is in “better”
condition at West Penn Hospital.
He suffered a double fracture in
his right leg when hit by a car on
Feb. 12.

During his absence Virginia
Lewis is serving as acting head of
the department. Thomas A. Dunn
and George F. Chisholm of the
department have taken over classes
conducted by Dr. Hovey.

The car which hit Dr. Hovey was
driven by Harold Steinberg, 28,
2120 Murray Avenue. It struck him
as he crossed Fifth Avenue at
Devonshire Street.

Discusses

H-Bomb

Within a week Pitt students are
getting a chance to hear two'ina-
tionally-known authorities on the
problems of the atomic age.

Maior George Fielding Eliot,
military analyst, author, and lec-
turer will speak on the military and
political implications of the H-Bomb
at 2:30 p.m. Thursday in Stephen
Foster Memorial Hall. Last Wed-
nesday Dr. David Bradley, author
of “No Place to Hide,” explained
the scientificiaspects of atomic
energy.

Experienced Reporter

Major Eliot has had long exper-
ience in the reporting and analyzing
of international and military affairs.
Two years before the start of World-
War II, he co-authored "If War
Comes," a prophetic book foresee-
ing the coming world crisis.

Since -then six books have come
from his pen, including “If Russia
Strikes,” published last year, a
comparison of the military strengths
of Russia and the United States.

During the war, Major Eliot broad-
cast and wrote daily on the progress
of the fighting. He was in direct
contact with many of the men who
were leading and directing America's
war effort.

I At the war’s end, he attended

several of the major conferences

with the establishment of peace.

He reported the first meeting of the

United Nations at San Francisco
in 1945.

Extensive Traveler
Major Eliot has travelled exten-

— sively through Europe and the Mid-

dle East. He obs-erved guerilla war-

O fare in the mountains of northern

Greece and wrote eye-witness ac-

 

  

 

  

T  counts of fighting in the streets of

]erusal'ém.

At present Major Eliot is writing
a weekly column of comments syn-
dicated in newspapers throughout
the country. He is also working on
a radio series to inform Americans
what may be expected from the
hydrogen bomb. Last December he
produced a similar series on re-'
cent atomic developments.

Major Eliot will appear as the
second speaker in the University
Lecture Series of which J. Edward
Ricart issecretary.

   Legislators

Hit Snag
(Cont. from Page 1)

The motion was unanimously ap-
proved.

The legislators also found time
to consider the problem of finding
time for rallies and special assem-
blies. A Congress-conducted poll
showed that students and faculty
favored adding an extra day at the
end of the semester to make up for
classtime used for such affairs dur-
ing this year.

To Investigate Proposal

Action on this report was witheld
pending investigation of a proposal
made by Helen P. Rush, dean of
women, at a meeting of the joint
Student-Faculty Relations Commit-
tee of the University Senate. Miss
Rush suggested that a free-time
activity period be scheduled every
day from 12:30 to 2 p.m. during
which meetings and assemblies
could be held without interrupting
classes.

me. I traveled a lot through Italy
and know a little about other Euro-

government overcome the national-

istic spirit of the many different

European peoples?”

Europe Favors Plan

Bradley replied, “Recent. nation-
al elections proved Europeans are
overwhelmingly in favor of world
federation. ,

The student then asked, “How
can we possibly do anything to in-
fluence the passage ofconstitution-
al amendments and congressional
billsas you advocate. We can’t join
a pressure group.. .” ‘

Bradley interrupted him, “Why
can’t you? That is the only way to
help. Clarence Streits’s group, the
United World Federalists,--they are
all working on ourcongressmen and
state legislatures. We are way ahead
