Cathedral hosts ghosts

by Katelyn Polantz
Eaitori/1 C/azief

A All was quiet. Outside the yel-
low- and pink—tinted windows,
students and cars drifted like
shadows across Bigelow Bou-
levard four stories below. We
waited. ‘

“Let’s sit very still for a min-
ute. Count to 60. And close your
eyes. Let’s see what would hap-
pen,” said E. Maxine Bruhns,
the director of Pitt’s Nationality
Rooms program.

We were in the hidden sec-
ond ﬂoor of the Early American
Nationality,Room, a stark recre-
ation of a 17th-century bedroom,
and we waited for the spirit of
Bruhns’ grandmother to appear.

“Look! The rope is moving,”
whispered Bruhns.

The rope wasn’t moving, but
Bruhns, who has directed the Na-
tionality Rooms for 43 years, said
strange things have happened
in. the room in the past. Objects
have fallen to the ﬂoor. Candle
ﬂames have ﬂickered in the air,

despite very little footitrafﬁc in
the room and even less airﬂow.

“Sometimes students feel a
chill — when a ghost comes by,
there’s a chill in the air,” she said.

About eight years ago, Bruhns
said, a tour group visiting the
room mysteriously smelled bread
baking. She said it couldn’t have
come from anywhere but the fire-
place’s stove on the ﬁrst ﬂoor.

Another time, Bruhns said a
tour guide brought a group into
the room, and the baby’s crib had
been rocking on its own.

When  Kiiigjordan became
the first deaf president of Gallaudet
University in \Washington, D.C., a re-
porteraskedhim,“Whatcanadeaf
person really do wim a college de-
gree?’

His answer, “Deaf people can do
anything except hear” That became
his personal mantra

Yesterday in Pitt’s Barco Law
Building, 65-year-oldjordan spoke to a
crowd composed of both the hearing
and the deaf as part of the law schools
Thomburgh Family Lecture Series in
Disability Law and Policy. V

Jordan, who has been deaf since he
was 21, served for 18 years as president
of Gallaudet University, the world’s
only university designed specifically
for deaf or hard of hearing students

Using both and  lan-

guage, he told the story of his tumul-
tuous path toward becoming president
of the university, an achievement that
he called a revolution in the disability
rights movement. '

When Gallaudet’s former presi-
dent resigned in 1987, the university
considered  a person who was
deaf as the new president:

Jordan became one of three ﬁnal-
ists for the position Two of the ﬁnal-
ists were men who were deaf includ-
ingjordan, and the third was a woman
who could hear and didn’t know 
languags - 9

At the time,]ordan thought he had
a very good chance of becoming the
new president, because the other deaf
man didn’t match his own, academic
credentials and the woman didn’t
know Sign language

But Gallaudefs board of trustees
appointed the hearing woman as presi-

dent, triggering a firestorm of protest
from Gallaudet students and faculty
who wanted one of the deaf men as
president

They organized a protest move-
ment called Deaf President Now and
marched to the White House from
Gallaudefs campus in northwest DC.

The DC police first tried to 
the protest by opening their trunks
and  out blow horns on the
mostly deaf crowd, but according to
_]ordan,“(It) didn’twoi ”

The protests eventually caused
Gallaudet’s board io reverse its deci-
sion.

Jordan, suddenly thrust into national
prominence, was under intense pres-
sure to succeed ’ v

‘When I first became president‘,
there were a lot of doubters,” said Jor-
dan .

He was also concerned that if he

failed as president, the “revolution” his
appointment had started would lose its
steam. 9

But despite extemal doubts and
internal fears, Jordan excelled as presi-
dent of Gallaudet

During his tenure, he increased the
university’s endowment from $5 rnil—
lion to $175 million, strengthened its
ties to Congressional and in-
creased the quality and quantity of its
enrollment

“Success really carried a strong
message,” said‘ Jordan “.All people
with disabilities should certainly have
the ability to lead the disability com-
munity.” ,

]ordan’s newfound fame attracted
many in the disabled community, and
Jordan suddenlybecame a symbol of
the disability rights movement of the
early ’90s

National politicians invited him to

Former deaf university president starts 'reVolution'

 at a congressional committee in
support of the landmark Americans
with Disabilities Act of 1990.

Jbrdan said he couldn’t remember
well the testimony he gave,‘ but he
remembered that it was well-received
because “it was presented by a person
who had become ‘a symbo ”

‘Jordan also remembered that while
reading to a pre-kindergarten class in
a Rhode Island deaf school, a deaf
student walked up to him, placed his
arm on his shoulder and left it there
the whole time Jordan was 

“Heknew,likehim,Iwasadea.f
person, but that I could be important,’ ’
saidjordan. “He knew, in his head, that
he could be important, too” '

After his personal story, Jordan
talked about theattitudes that society
takes toward the disabled. .

He said the most crippling aspect
of  a disabled person is not the

:ai‘uer ix  2. 3. st. semi:

After tour guides told these stories, a
University custodian named john Carter

told Bruhns that he, too, had a spooky eX— .

perience.

One day when he was tidying the up-
stairs of the room, he heard a woosh and
spun around, startled. The quilt on the bed
had been turned down, and the mattress

‘ had an imprint on it that resembled the

shape of a person.

That person, Bruhns said, must have
been the spirit of her grandmother, Mar-
tha jane Poe, a \X/est-Virginian who died in
the 19305 and whom Bruhns mused was
related to the master of the macabre, Ed-

V gar Allen Poe.

Martha Poe’s belongings now rest in
the Early American room: a framed photo
of her as a young woman under a splin-
tered pane of glass, a quilt she and Bruhns’
mother had hand-stitched, a small, fragile
Bible that belonged to her husband and
Bruhns’ own embroidered baby blanket
and pillow. '

Bruhns said she believes that these
items, particularly the quilt, conjure the
woman’s spirit. '

“I’m very attached to her,” said Bruhns.

‘ “I feel at home and perfectly relaxediin this
_ room.”

Not everyone feels relaxed, though.
Two custodians, Ruth Mullen and Floyd

Clawson, who clean the upstairs room oc—.

casionally, said they recently encountered
the ghost. -

“You open the bottom door, and it
looked like a shadow darted out of the
room,” said Clawson, motioning toward
the wallwhere he had seen the apparition.

Mullen added, “Just from the look on
his face, you could tell he saw something.”

Bruhns smiled at hearing their stories,

asserting that her grandmother’s presence
was indeed there. i

“Strange things happen here,” said
Bruhns before we left the room. “She
makes me feel she’s here. There’s little jokes
that she likes to play, just little jokes.”

Building a mystery

Enter the Early American Room, room
No. 328 in the Cathedral of Learning, and
it looks like a typical great room in a histor-
ical wooden hut — complete with a dining
table, a quilt, spinning wheel and a basket
of corn and pumpkins on the dark wood-
paneled ﬂoor. ~

A brick ﬁreplace dominates most of the

A  left wall. Cast iron kettles, a skillet, a rudi-

mentary toaster and a wafﬂe—maker adorn
the hearth, and two riﬂes rest in a rack
above the mantle.

Next to the open ﬁreplace, a closet, no
wider than shoulder width, breaks up the
wall. But this is no ordinary closet.

Bruhns led me inside and ran her ﬂat-
tened palms along the wall. She pushed on
a knot in the wood, and a light turned on to

’ our left. Behind a thick, brick secret panel

that was already open, a hidden staircase
led behind the ﬁreplace.

We climbed up the creaking spiral stair-
way, and another full room stretched off to
our right, the second floor bedroom and
the home of the ghost.

Theodore Bowman, formerly the Uni-

_ versity architect and Pitt Chancellor John

G. Bowman’s nephew, was the mind he-
hind the design of the room. Bowman,
with the ﬁnancial support of George Hub-
bard Clapp, the namesake of Clapp Hall,
dedicatedethe room in 1938.

“Ted sort of fellin love with the idea
behind the ‘House of Seven Gables_,”’ said

disability itself; but the socially constructed stigma
that comes with the condition.

“The word disability, with all its negative con-
notations, needs to be changed,” said Jordan.

If people could change their thought patterns
about disability, Jordan said, the disabled would
be able to achieve so much more

He explained that when the American Dis-
abilities Act of 1990 came into effect, electronics
manufacturers oliginally complained about the
high cost of adding a chip to televisions, which
would provide captioning for the hearing im-
paired.

Bruhns. “He fell in love with the secret
room and the secret staircase.”

She said the idea worked perfectly in this
Nationality Room, because early American
settlers would have needed a place to hide
from American Indian attackers and witch
hunters.

Now, the entire Early American Room
stays locked —- except for tours and special
events — to protect a valuable collection of
17th century coins and the two riﬂes that
reside in the main area.

Bruhns and a team of Quo Vadis guides,
student tour guides who lead groups
through the architecture and history of
the Nationality Rooms, hope to conjure up
these stories and perhaps some paranormal
activity tonight.

Bruhns, while waiting for her grand-
mother’s spirit, will lead a ghost watch in
the Early American Room from 6:30 p.m.
to 10:30 pm; It’s free and open to the "pub-
lic.

But in less than two years, the cost of a televi-
sion set rose only 351 because of the chip.

He also told a story he had heard about a
worker who decided to shovel only the stair en-
trance to a building,  the ramp entrance
because he was tired.

.A  asked him why he wouldn’t just shovel
the ramp, so that everyone could get in the build-
ing if he was too tired to shovel both

_ Jordan used these examples to explain why
the Amencans with Disabilities Act has failed to
achieve its goals

Today, 24 percent of people who are disabled

live in poverty, said Jordan, compared to only 9
percent of people without disabilities

He also said that in 2007 only 36.9 percent of
working age people with disabilities had a job.

After his lecture, a few audience members
who were deaf asked him questions in sign
language, including a deaf and blind man who
signed that he didn’t want to be labeled as an ex-
pendable person because of his disability.

Jordan walked up to the man, clasped his
hands inhis and signedwith him, sayingthatno
person with a disability should ever feel expend-
able

Politics in the game

Obama reaches out to voters with l
video game advertising I

Think you can get away
from those annoying. television
campaign ads by playing video
games? '

Think again.

Sen. Barack Obama is the
first presidential candidate to
buy ad space inside video games.
Eighteen games, including Mad-
den NFL O9 and Guitar Hero
3, contain ads that appear on

3 signs and billboards in the game.

When the Xbox 360 console is
connected to the Internet, it is
updated with new ads and fea-
tures. .

The Obama campaign hopes

‘ to attract younger voters with

the ads. “It reaches an audience '
' that is typically hard to reach -
T young males, roughly 18 to 34,”

Holly Rockwood, a spokeswom-
an for Electronic Arts, told the
London Free Press.

In-game advertising is_ a
brand new venue for presiden-

ltial politics. While the idea of

video game ads might seem
outrageous at ﬁrst, the truthiis
that we have reached an age in
technological progress where
such ads will quickly become the

.norm. In-game ads- are simply

the next step in the natural pro-

, gression of hi-tech advertising.

We are worried, however,
that advertisers might get" car-
ried away. Will in—game billboard
advertising soon lead to actually
incorporating candidates into

'  the game? We hope not. For this
A reason, advertisers should be
. sure to set limits so that the ads

do not go too far.
For the most. part, howev-

' Let, the ads are a positive step.
7Through video games, Obama

is able to ‘reach a new generation

, of voters, people who might be
;..c:-awtirlg baﬂots. for.th.e very ﬁrst.

‘also an appropriate balance to
.Obama’s recent 30-minute in-

’ ing that Obama is ahead or tied

time this election. 

It is unlikely that the ads will i
make a major impact in swaying 
voters. 

Nevertheless, Obama’s de- 

cision to take out in—g'ame ads 5
shows that he’s an innovative
thinker. When it comes to reach-
ing out to voters and putting
himself out there, the Democrat 
has been exceptionally active. :

The video game ads are

fomercial, which aired on seven
network and cable stations on
Wednesday. With its segments
about health care -and the econ-
omy, Obama was able to reach
older, middle—class Americans.
The infomercial proved to be a
success, drawing nearly 33.6 mil-
lion viewers, according to Niels-
en Media Research. _
In the ﬁnal stretch of the
campaign, Obama seems to be
the only candidate who is mak- .

I ing an effort to reach out to the 

American people. Sen. John Mc— 
Cain, on the other hand, seems i
to have disappeared. 

In all fairness, Obama’s pri— 
vately funded campaign allows E

' him to take , such expensive ,-

measures. ' McCain, whose cam-
paign depends on federal fund-
ing, criticized Obama for the
ad. “When you’re watching this l
gauzy, feel—good commercial,

just remember that it was paid I

for with broken promises,” said
McCain, according to the Los
Angeles Times.

But all ﬁnancial and advertis-
ir1g issues aside, Obama’s enthu-
siasm far outshines. McCain’s.
And with the latest polls show-

in key states, his efforts might 
pay off on Election Day:   ._ .

Advocacy, that cornerstone
of college liberalism, is a“ strange
beast. To some, it is the shining
monolith of politics before peo-
ple stop caring and have to«start
winning elections. To others, it is
a sly devil that seduces students

into gathering in crafty enclaves-

to pat each other on the back.
Of course, it is not fully either
of these, and I -have no interest

in determining exactly where it ‘

falls between them.
Neither the naivete of un-

qualiﬁed support not the self-in-"

flaring cynicism of ﬁerce critics
deserves terribly much attention.
What concern me are the cultur-

al and ideological problems of _

advocacy on a much more gen-
eral level. . ~ g
Advocacy can be divided into

‘two general categories: aware-

ness-raising and policy reform.

The former is, unquestionably, ,

the more innocuous of the two
and the closest that advocacy gets
to its unproblematic ideal. There

 is not some awareness quotient

that’ advocacy could upset by
caring too much about too many
things, and the public can never
be too informed. Awareness-
raising is thoroughly a positive
endeavor. It might get annoying,
but the beneﬁts of an informed
public outweigh the drawbacks
of a few irritated individuals so
much that to complain about
these efforts is crass.

It is on the side of policy re- 

form that advocacy stands on
questionable ground. The narra-
tive behind policy reform is that
politicians are so caught up in
their agendas that they either ne-
glect humanitarian concerns or
actually violate them. Politicians
act in discord to the positions of
advocacy groups because they
don’t care or don’t know about
the issue. Through attention, pe-
titioning and demonstration to-
ward these politicians, advocacy

 

opinions

Advocacy, politicians: a disconnect

groups can pressure change.
Here is the problem: Most
politicians are aware of the is-
sues that concern advocacy
groups long before ‘the ﬁrst
sandwich board is even donned.
Furthermore, most politicians
do care about humanitarian con-
cerns. While this does not apply
to every lawmaker '— some re-
ally are that dumb and greedy --
politicians are not the ‘heartless,
political automatons of. popular
belief. So, why then do these
leaders not _ act in accordance
with advocacy group wishes?
The reason for this discon-

 While this does not 3
apply to every lawmaker...
politicians are not the
heartless, political
automatons of popular
belief. So, why then do"
these leaders not act in
accordance with

 advocacy group wishes?

3?

nect is that the ends desired by

advocacy groups do not nec-
essarily entail the means they
propose to achieve these ends.
This doesn’t mean that_ advo-
cacy groups don’t know the best
ways to reach their goals; often,
advocacy groups are the best
informed about their issues, re-
taining experts and other knowl-
edgeable people. However, what
this does ‘mean is that judging

political progress toward a cer-

tain end by the actions politi-
cians are taking is, tenuous in
cases of advocacy. The ,meter
stick by which political prog-
ress is measured as satisfactory
is often one of how much the
political actions line up  the
actions proposed by advocacy.
Herein lies the problem.
Advocacy tends to erase the
difference between ends and

' means and, in. their stead, it

trumpets a message that mixes

the two to ether. “If ou su -
8 Y P

port our cause, you will support

the policies we support.” The

‘process whereby the advocacy

group arrived at the policy it
promotes becomes u obscured,
and the public is presented
with‘ the idea that the advocacy
group’s policies are naturally
married to the ends that it wish-

es to achieve. This is a false and A

dangerous mix up.

Imagine that there is an awful
civil war in a country we will call
Sweetland. An advocacy group
wants to end this war. Therefore,
it asks politicians to send money
to the government of Sweetland
to squelch the barbaric rebels. In
its drumming up of public sup-
port, wanting to stop the war in

Sweetland becomes equated with‘

wanting the government to send
‘money to Sweetland’s govern-
ment. Politicians who don’t sup-
port sending money are, then,
against the advocacy group and,
by transitivity, against stopping
the war. Cue public outrage.

Now, I know that the situa-
tion isn’t as simple as all of this.
Advocacy groups do understand
that there is more than one way
to skin a war. However, this does
not prevent the confusion of
ends and means. i '

So, is the solution that the
policy group should just raise
awareness? The answer is no, be-
cause then these groups would

be little more than ﬂaccid cheeri '

leaders —— please excuse the
sexually controversial imagery.

Advocacy groups need to back ‘

up their awareness with action if
anyone is going to be motivated
to act on their initiative. What,
then, is the solution? . ‘

First of all, there should be
more public dialogue than pub-
lic exhibition. Demonstrating is
wonderful, and I fully support

it, but without extensiveipublic _

forum, the public loses sight of
the agenda creation and the ends

and means become confused. '

Secondly, advocacy groups
should focus more energy on
idea reform. Philosophy trickles
down to politics — I promise.

outina chairbehind an oakdesklitteredwith the
regalia of ‘an accomplishedlife in music and aca-
demia Folders, papers,'CDs, music books and
magazines are strewn about

A gentleman with lightly peppered hair and a
 mustache, Davis is now the director of
Pitt studies He’s steadily built a career as a pre-
mier  musician, composer, author, teacher and
more since as early as age 12, when he bought his
very ﬁrst saxophone ’

Davis now only spends one day a week in his
first-floor office in the Pitt music building, but
when he’s here, he seems to enjoy himself

At 71, he is preparing to retire soon But he
knows he’s got at least a few more concerts, semi-
nars and lessons left in him. He has much more to
do before he passes the torch of one of America’s

first academic  studies programs — the one

that he started himself, from scratch, 39 years ago.
Early in Davis’ life, he began to hone his musi-
cal  and quickly rose to the foreﬁont of many
bands as a result He has since traveled all around
the world, ‘fplaying everywhere from whorehouses

to the \X/hite House,” said Davis and 

are  that have seemed to come naturally to
this artist and educator, and since his career began
to bloom in 1949 Davis has  redeﬁned
himself, his art and his profession

Davis’ roots stretch back to the center of the

United States in Kansas City, Mo., where he lived
two blocks from one of the most signiﬁcant 
musicians of his generation, Charlie Parker, who
would eventually inﬂuence Davis’ 1974 Ph.D. dis-

, sertation at Wesleyan University.

Davis also shared his neighborhood with lo-
cal  members, and violence wasn’t unknown
 up toward the end of Kansas Cityfs 
session era of the late ’20s and ’30s, Davis found
himself literally engulfed by the city’s sprawling ur-
ban  and blues scene

In a rundown house living with his mother, a
12-year-old Davis carefully listened to the musings
of a local saxophonist called Little June, who lived
across the street Despite not  a musical in-

strument of any kind, June regulaﬂy taught Davis.

Davis soon started vvorkingjat a jitney cab ser-
vice, earning $7.50 a week answering telephones
Intime,withalittlehelp fromhis parents, hehad
earned enough money to buy his very first saxo-
phone, the Silvertone by Sears and Roebucks Co.

' “Silvertone was the cheapest of the cheapest
You know coming from Sears it couldn’t be too
great,’ ’ said Davis

After  from the University of Kan-
sas in 1960 with a degree in music education, Davis
was drafted into the Army and sent to Europe He
would ultimately spend seven and a half years of
hislifethere,reachingthepeakofhisperfonning
career playing in the most popular Paris night clubs
with jazz greats Kenny Clark, Woody Shaw, Don-
ald Byrd and Eric Dolphy,'to name a small fraction.
He would also meet his wife of nearly 50 years,’

album, Hqﬁjy Gin: in 1964; and build his name to

celebrity status, which would eventually entitle him I

to develop Pitt’s ﬁrst degree-granting jazz studies
program in 1969.

Lectuting at Pitt one year before, 
composer and teacher David Baker, who had cre-
ated the ﬁrst American jazz studies program aIndi-

ana University, recommended Davis to head Pitt’s A

new program.

“There was a time when we were an isolated
phenomenon, particularlyin academia,’ ’ said Baker
“But Nathan was’ one of those people who I think
had the vision to see that the academy was 
to have to accept us on equal terms It just seemed
to me, if I was  to recommend somebody,
I wanted to recommend somebody who actually
had a major reputation as a player A lot of other
people, theyfve already been  before they

I earned their stripes Nathan Davis brought that to

the jo .”

Davis was finally hired in 1969, along with his
current co-worker Don Franklin, professor of ba-
roque music studies ' i .

“Pitt was  their offerings and really
developing an undergraduate program in various
areas,” said Franklin. “So we bothinawaywere on

the ground ﬂoor of building and developing Pitt’s _

department of music in the early 1970s”

One of the first of his kind, Davis had aca-
demic possibilities that seemed endless

“I got off the plane (in Pittsburgh), and there
were 250 jazz students waiting to take the jazz his-
tory course,” said Davis ‘Me  a real live 
musician light out of the ﬁeld, like, from the night
club into the classroom, it was wide open for us”

Since  the position at Pitt, Davis has devel— ,

oped a premier program and led the record-

he has created the International Academy of Jazz "

Hall of Fame, the Sonny Rollins Internationaljazz
Archives, the annual Pitt jazz Seminar and Con-

Cert and the state—of—the-art Wlﬂiam R Robinson 6

Broadway stars teach
theater hopefuls hints

by Sam Stahl
S ta/]" ~ Writer

MTX Master Class
Sunday, 1 p.m. t5 4 p.m.
Pittsburgh CLO Academy, Downtown
419-981-2934

If dance lessons with a Broadway star sounds
like your cup of tea, you’re in luck: Two of them
will be in town this Sunday.

Broadway veterans Michael McGurk and Gina
Philistine will teach a class at the Pittsburgh CLO
Academy on Nov 2 from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. as part
of the Academy’s third annual Musical Theater
Extravaganza

MIX is an annual workshop hosted by the
Academy for students ages 10 to 18, as well as col-
lege students Academy principal Patty Maloney
explained, “This is the ﬁrst time we’ll be featur-
ing Broadway stars In the past we’ve had a wide
variety of classes, including  and salsa, vocal
health, stage combat,  hop and head shots”

For the first hour of Sundays Extravaganza,
Donna Belajac of Donna Belaiic ‘Casting will
conduct a seminar about auditioning and 
with agencies

Belajac will “teach the kids the diﬂference be-
tween a legitimate  agency and a non‘—legiti—
mate  agency,’ ’ said Maloney. “A lot of times
kids seeanadinthepaperthatsays, ‘Cometo the

Holiday Inn and you’ll be a star,’ and then they take
all their money. Here, they’re  to learn about
those kinds of scams”

Maloney said they’ll also learn how to audition
and carry themselves better in front of the camera

Theﬁnaltwohourswillbespentinamaster
class with McGurk and Philistine to learn Broad-
way choreography and attend a question and an-
swer session A

Both performers attended Seton LaSalle 
School and the CLO Academy Mc.Gurk starred in
“The Wedding Singer” and “The Music Man” on
Broadway, as well as in the national tour of “Doc—
tor Dolittle” Philistine appeared in Broadway/s
“Bombay Dreams” and “Saturday Night Fever”

“The reason why it’s so great to have these
two is that they’re so down to earth,” said Malo-
ney. “They’re so  to share their process It’s
important for these kids who have stars in their
eyes to hear from people who are not much older
thanthem how theygotwhere theyare—to
hear that they shouldn’t  up on their dream.”

Though the event is open to the public, space

Luck against the Irish?

by Alex Oltmanns
For t/2e Pitt New

just last week, the Pitt football
teamwasrankedinthetop20in
every major poll and garnering na-
tional attention It appeared that the
Panthers were ready to continue their
winning ways against Rutgers

Fast forward to today, where Pitt is
coming off a 54-34 loss to the Scarlet
Knights The defense was badly ex-

posed, starting center Robb Houser.

was knocked out for the season with a
broken ankle, and the health of quar-
terback Bill Stull is in question after he
suffered a concussion and a stinger
Yet the Panthers (5-2, 2-1 Big East)
can turn it all around just as quickly
when they travel to Notre Dame,
Ind., this week to take on the Fight-
ing Irish (5-2) at historic Notre Dame
Stadium tomorrow at 2:30 p.m.

Pitt will have to itnprove on last
week’s defensive performance in
which  did not punt in the
first half and Scarlet Knights quar-
terback Mike Teel‘ torched the Pan-
thers’ secondary for 361 yards and six
touchdowns '

Pitt coach Dave Wannstedt ex-
pects his team’s opponents, especially
Notre Dame, to throw more often
because of in struggles in the sec-
ondary.

“Notre Dame may throw it 60
times this wee ” said Wannstedt
“We expect them to come out and
throw the football. They came out

, against North Carolina and ran the

ﬁrst 15 plays without a  back
on the ﬁeld.”

Notre Dame seems to be more
comfortable with the passing game
this season as highly touted sopho-
more quarterback jimmy Clausen

continues to develop and learn coach
Charlie Weis’ offense.
Wannstedt recognizes the differ-

ence between Clausen’s struggles as-

a freshman and his performance this
year. . ,
up “[Clausen’s] getting better,” said
Wannstedt "I think you can see the
talent; He’s a better athlete than what
I ﬁrst thought”

Clausen, a consensus blue—chip re-
cruit, has 1,832 passing yards andi15
touchdowns, which is already more
yards than he had last season and
twice as many touchdowns

His primary targets this season
have been sophomore Golden Tate
and freshman stud Michael Floyd.

Both have 31 receptions, with Tate -

accumulating 565 yards and Floyd

achieving 533.

Stull sits vvith injury

Football, page l7
has to improve. Wannstedt explained that he
might shake  up there this Saturday

“Ricky Gary played a little bit, as did 
Fields [against Rutgers] ,” said Warmstedt ‘Tm
not going to stand up here and tell you that we’re
going to have changes, but we are evaluating ev-
eryone on what we’re doing and who we’re deal-
ingwi .”

\X/annstedt is also aware that Notre Dame
has another element to its offense with the run-
nirlggama

“They ran it 50 times last week against Wash~
ington for 250 yards,” said \X/annstedt. “They are
very capable of  the football.”

Notre Dame’s ground game‘ is a 
back—by—committee attack with sophomore Ar-
mando Allen, sophomore Robert Hughes and
junior James Aldridge all rushing for more than
75 yards in at least one game this season.

The Panthers might lean more on their own
running game, because baclmp quarterback Pat
Bostick might possibly take over this week for
Stull, whose status for the game is still uncertain.

W/annstedt said that Bostick made some nice

throws last week and that he has seen the sopho-
more grow as a quarterback since he’s been at
Pitt;

“I think he’s definitely more prepared today
than he was a year ago today,” said \X/annstedt.

However, if the Panthers do elect to run the
ball more this week, they have the weapons to
doit. Halfback LeSean McCoy leads the way
on offense this year with for Pitt, with LaRod
Stephens—Howling stepping up when needed.

McCoy continues to light up opposing teams
and is currently tied for fourth in touchdowns in
all of Division 1 with 14. In seven games, he’s

Also, \Y/annstedt said that quarterback Greg
Cross could see some more playing time this
week Cross has the potential as a scrambling
quarterback to add another dimension to Pitt’s
 attack.

The Panthers might need all these dimen-
sions of their offense to be in sync tomorrow

Men's Basketball

Panthers
voted No.

6 in ESPN/
USA Today

by Mike Gladysz
Sparta Editor

The Pitt men’s basketball team earned a
No. 6 preseason ranking in the ESPN / USA
Today poll Thursday morning — the fourth
time in as many years that Pitt enters the
season in the nadon’s top 25.

Pitt is one of seven Big East teams
ranked in the top 25 — a record for the poll.
Previously, no other conference has had
more than five teams ranked at once in the
preseason poll.

North Carolina earns the No. 1 spot,
with Big East teams Connecticut and Lou-
isville following. North Carolina, which
was also ranked No. 1 in the preseason
poll last season, returns star forward Tyler
Hansbrough, who opted to return for his
senior season instead of entering the NBA.
Hansbrough averaged 22.6 points and 10.2
rebounds per game a season ago.

Only two teams ranked No. 1 in the
preseason have won the national title. Con-
necticut did it in 2003-04, and then Florida
did it in 2006-07.

Last year’s national champion, Kansas,
ranks 23rd in the poll after losing three of
last year’s starters to the NBA.

Notre Dame is ranked ninth, marking
four Big East teams in the top 10 of the
country. Marquette is No. 17, followed by

' Georgetown one spot later, and No. 25 Vil-

lanova grabbed the last spot.
The preseason Associated Press poll will
be released next week.
