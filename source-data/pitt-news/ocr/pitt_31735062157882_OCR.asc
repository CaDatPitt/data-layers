Sense-Les .

By LES GALLAGHER

In last Friday’s News there
were two letters to the editor; pro
and con, regardless of the way
you look at it. First, I will talk
to Sammy. Hello, Sammy. Sam-
my, half of your letter was de-
voted to my insinuation about
stuffing the ballot boxes and pay-
ing the vote counters. What hap-
pened -Sammy? You attack in-
sinuation but you don’t mention
the facts in your painstakingly
written letter. You, in no way,
came forward to protect the 20-
dollar ﬁne, the rnisrepresentation,
the newspaper theft.

It was the summation of_these
dirty-dealing factors which made
me go out on‘the limb. I made
the insinuation that an outﬁt that
would do business the -way that
the IF slate handled their last af-
fair, would stop at nothing. And
whether there is proof or not, I
still say, .-that any organization
-which would squat to the "depths
of the IF slate, would pull any
type of deal. Sammy, this is not
only my opinion, I believe that
Dr. Fergueson thinks that this
group owes the school and stu-
dents. anapology.

The Poor.Kids

Also, Sammy, you take issue
with my sarcastic, “poor, frater-
nity kids.” Sammy,‘ show -me the
greatest, purest, -most noble man
there is and if I see himdo but
one wrong, I shall’ remember’ the
one wrong. Like little kids, Sam-
my, they stood around the -halls
waiting for, the papers to arrive
so they could steal a few and run.
Oh, but it was ‘am. They stood
‘in groups and talked in whispers
and played _like big b'oys, They

v were almost like union goons,
_ waiting outside the factory, to cop

the company paper. rm telling
you, Sammy, just like’ the big
boys. . V

Another thing, Sammy, you
You‘ say that foul balls are hit

and not thrown. I agree with you,

‘Sammy. I -was wrong in saying

that the frats threw a foul ball
but on the other hand, because of
time and space limits; I cou1dn_’t
of the fraternity foul
balls. , ' ‘-~ , '

Like you say, Sammy, the um-
pire does sweep home plate. But
_since Student Congress, a frat-
controlled organization, sets up
the election rules" and sees to, it
«that "the ballots are printed and
distributed, " plus placing one of
their men on policing duty, well,
Sammy, to “tell you the truth, I
ﬁgured that I might as well let
the frat boys sweep home plate.-
Because, lad, I didn’t see any um-
pire. -
'If Was Consfrucfive

Eliminating certain hair-split-
ting sentences in your letter Sam,
it rwas constructive. The other
side should always be heard. I
agree with you ‘Sam; not all of

, the kids are in fraternities. just

the same as all the men are not
greeks. I did not ‘attack fraterni-
ties in my last column,-I attacked
the policies which these fraterni-
ties sanctioned.

If Alpha Phi Omega felt them-
-selves in any way insulted for
what I had written; I offer an
apology. To Don _Wilde, no mat-
ter how unreproachable a char-
acter, no apology. “ I made no
allusion to his honesty. I just feel
that_he is not_ omnipresent. N 0 one
is everywhere at once.

T_o Dom, I say hello. Thanks
for the letter you wrote. Your
correlation ‘between college life
and adult thinking is something
that many universities fail to do
I agree with you, too, Dom. I
do get loud. But you have to
make sure that the guys in the
backseats can hear. You, said
yourself, Dom, that you were in
the backseats until you heard the
noise. ‘

It was nice to hear this week that Pitt is going to let its
freshman football players be athletes again. Until now, you
kno_w, the frosh have just been common laborers. "

Tom Hamilton sat down to lunch with the cit_v’s press
Monda_V and announced that the ﬁrst-year men would be given-

a schedule of intercollegiate games¢
this year, despite the fact that]
such procedure is not Emily Post
with the Big Ten.

Panthers Obedient

.The signiﬁcance of I-lamilton’s
. announcement, however, lies in the
fact that in the past, the Big Ten '
barked the signals and the: Pan-
thers ran through the plays like
‘good little boys. No questions were
asked.

Nobody in‘ these parts
knew (or would-ever say they
knew) exactly why the BigTen
frowned on frosh games. '

_. Cail've1' Takes a Guess

A ‘ “ GraduatelManager Frank Car-
ver said he guessed the purpose
was to keep the freshmen’s minds

ever

.ever the motive, it seems clear at

     

T)“
on their schoolbooks. At any rate.-
the policy here seemed to be one
of “your’s is not to question why—-
your’s is but to do or die.”

At the present, the Pitts are
neither doing nor dying.

Still- Booking

The athletic administration is
still booking Big Ten opponents
and is conﬁdent -that _such oppo-
nents will continue to be sched-
uled. .\  p 

Perhaps Pitt no longer cares to
be admitted into the Big Ten. Qr
maybe Pitt ﬁgures that the proud

and independent get their way
sooner than the beggars. What-

this point that the marionette
show is over. -

The Phi Kaps were dropped
from the unbeaten ranks, Tuesday,
by the undefeated Phi Delts, 7-3.

The game was closely contested
most of the way. However, in the
sixth inning, Hartman singled into

Phi Kappa, and start a‘ four run
rally which proved the margin of
victory. ’

Perfect Records

By STANLEY SKIRBOLL

With Leo Bemis humming “It ain’t gonna rain no more,’f intra-
"mural softball reached the halfway mark this week.

At this halfway mark, no teamiin any league is decisively in
front. In fact, there are only eight unbeaten teams in the whole

circuit, according to statistics released by the intramural oﬂice, last

Tuesday.
Leading the ace in the Inde-
pendent League is a team that en-

tered this year “with an eye on
the future.” The Faculty Diehards
have become a ‘dark horse entry.
With a record of three wins

against no defeats, the Diehards

threaten to set‘ an example‘ for
future faculty teams.

In the fraternity . loop, where
the situation is more ferocious,
the defending champs, the, Phi Eps
got dumped from their consecu-
tive winning streak by_ the league-
leading Phi Delts.

Delta Tau Delta and‘ the Phi

Gams_ are in the lead in the other .

frat league.

Three, other unbeaten outﬁts,
YMCA Wisemen, _AII Engineers,
and the Psi Omegas seem_to be
rolling to their league champion-
ships.

The Panther Club will -meet
on Thursday, _May 12, at 7:30

The Team. Joe made the goods; his
father sold them. Selling was no trick
when war came; the trick was produc—
tion. Joe turned it by picking up the y
newest textile machines, applying the
newest techniques, and plowing -all
proﬁts back into more plants. Joe~’s
aim was integrzltion—en0ugh plants to
-handle wool virtually from the sheep’s
back to finished cloth. In 1942 Aire-
tlale W'0rsted Mills, Inc. was healthy ‘
:nough to take over Woonsocket’s

Axelrods wove the Jeffrey Finishing.

New Bedford’s old, famed Wamsutta
Mills (sheetings, broadcloths, spe-
cialty fabrics). Joe and his dad, who
‘s treasurer, now have 3,150 men &
women (including Wzlmsutta) work-
