Bob Silberstein turned in his
resignation as business manager of
Spring Festival last week’ because
of the “press of classes and other
activities. ' I
, To succeed him the Student
5’ Congress Appointments Commit-
tee chose Jimmy Madden, public-
ity chairman of last year’s festi-
val. _

Silberstein’s resignation came at

j ‘almost the same time that Festi-
val heads got together’ with the
‘Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce
to make the Festival’s theme coin-

- cide with the Chamber’s seventy-
ﬁfth anniversary celebration in
May.

Besides his job as business man-
ager of Festival, Silberstein is a
member of Student Congress and

_ is chairman of the Congress Ap-
pointments Committee. He is also
.a member of the swim team and

fan upperclass counselor. J

Jim 4 Madden Replaces Silberstein
pring" Festival Business Manager

Jimmy Madden, Silberstein’s
successor, is a member of Men’s
Council at present. He was one
of the Big Three of .last~year’s
Festival, holding. the .post_ of pub-
licity chairman. Since then he has
served as publicity man for a
number of social functions.

Up until its demise last year
Madden was a prominent mem-
ber of the Pitt Veterans Associa-
tion and was president at the
time that it folded last spring.

Festival Publicity Chairman Al
Capozzi said that committee mem-
bers were “very sorry” to hear of
Silberstein’s resignation.

Silberstein and Capozzi, along
with Howard Davies, were picked
last spring to handle this year’s
festival week. It marked the ﬁrst
time that the three top positions
on the Festival committee were
ﬁlled a year in advance. Previ-
ously they had been chosen in the
December prior to the Festival. ‘

bum of ' beautiful tangos the tempo has
been slowed down to a moderate pace and
the rhythm more deﬁned, making the rec-
ord more dancable. The album includes
such tango favorites as “La. Oomprasita?,’,’

chids In The Moonlight” and others_ . . .

Ella Fitzgerald “The First‘ Lady of Song”
who started her career swinging a nursery
rhyme called “'l‘isket-A-Tasket” will act has
pulling power for Norm Granz’s “Jazz At The
Philharmonic” this Friday evening in yonder
Syria Mosque. Ella is the gal Whose “Lady:Be
Good” and be-bop version of “How High The

Moon” and other great Waxings have hit high
in record sales all over the country.
Granz’s jazz group will consist of many
top flightbe-bop boys. Tommy Turk, Pitts-
bui-gh’s own versatile trombonist, who"-is known
to visitoi-s of the Carnival Loung.e'and” fans
of the “Duces/VVild” will befeatured in the
session. Also a Pittsburgh boy is Ray Brown
who was one-time bass man, for Dizzy.G;ille_ls-.
pie. Drum chores will be‘ handledby Shelly
Manne who recently lost his job with Kenton.
ll/Ianne was also featured with Les"-Brown a’
while back. The musician’s musician "Coleman
Hawkins will play his mellow tenor sax. The
Hawk has won every Esquire‘ Gold Award since -
its conception. Sonny Griss, 22: year old alto
sax‘ sensation, will also be on the»bill.:“Fa.ts”
Navarro, whose waxing of “Double Talk” has
Won a gerat deal of acclaim, will handle trum-
pet chores. Fatsshas also played with Gellespie
and Eckstine. Hank Jones, who is ‘known for
his ability to play both be-‘bop and Chopin,
,will ride the 88’s. On tenor sax, sharing honors '
with Hawkins, will be Flip Phillips.‘ Flip has
played with many outstanding groups like
Herma_n,'Ventura and others. He has recently
enjoyed success with his “Perdido”,' featured

ing to Jack Young, Mercury distributor in the
Pittsburgh area, Volume '9' of JATP titled

For those who like tangos I’d suggest
a listen to MGM's ‘new _ album: release

New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and oth-

INTERESTING SPEAKERS

. Pitt students have never taken much of an interest in the
speakers brought to the University periodically by the Stu-
dent Congress Assemblies Committee. But during the next two
weeks there will be two good reasons for a change in attitude.
Those reasons are Frank Gervasi and Stuart Chase.

Both men are recognized as leadiiigmeii in their respec-
tive ﬁelds—Gervasi in journalism and world affairs, Chase.in
economics and modern thought. Most‘ important, both men are
well known. '

There is no reason why both men sliouldn’t speak to full
houses. Their topics are timely, their authority cannot be doubt-
ed. They have something to say—and they should not have to
say it to an empty house. ‘

By Lecturer

Lawrence Thurman, Museum
Curator of Western Pennsylvania‘
Historical Society and history lec-
turer at the University, has dis-

covered a small portable desk be- A
lieved to have been the property

of Abraham Lincoln. With this
find was an inkstand deﬁnitely
established as having been his.

Mr. Thurman found the articles
at the old Forsythe Log House at
Penn and Negley. The house was
the property of the late Thomas
Mellon II. His uncatalogued lot
of historical articles was donated
by the Mellon Estate to the West-
ern Pennsylvania Historical So-
ciety. .

The inkstand is identiﬁed by
the signature “A. Lincoln,‘Spring-
ﬁeld, 1853” and the statuette, of
a horse. This inkstand has been
authentisized by the owner.. On
the. writing desk are several
entries, apparently of bills due or
paid.

They were painting the windows oftheir

All of this was done so that the cows inside
the barn would be shut ‘off from the botherand

see nothing but peace and contentment. -

And it came to us that U.S.'Savings Bonds

Panthers Have Opportunity
For Upset Victory Over WVU

Saturday night at Morgantown, West Virginia, Pitt’s
Panthers wind up their long trek through the 1948-49 basket-
ball season, an experience that carried them to almost every
section of the country. j 

The Panthers, owning a record of 11 wins and 13 losses,
meet West Virginia University.

out the season in a sensational¢
manner. A win over‘Lee Patton’s
team would be the ﬁrst major up-
set of the season for Pitt. _

Although the Panthers gave
West Virginia a rough time in
their last meeting—a 54-51 Moun-
taineer victory at the Stadium-
Dr. H. C. Carlson’s Ice Cream Eat-
ters are not given much of chance
this time. The reason is the loca-
tion of the game.
' West Virginia has not been
beaten in its last 57* home games.
However, -its last home whipping,
received back in February, 1944,
was administered by none other
than Pitt. _
A side attraction in Saturday’s
game will be the record-smashing
scoring of Panther Sammy David.
Every time David scores a point
he breaks his own record for the
most points ever scored by a Pitt
man in one season. '
The game-also writes ﬁnis to the
college basketball careers of Da-
vid andteammate Oland (Dodo)

POA's ’Better Officiating’ Ends

Bitter Protests of IM Teams

By STAN SKIRBOLL
A common call to the intra-
mural oﬁice last year A. “We
protest the game. Boy, that ref-
,»
This year things are different.
With the IM basketball campaign
drawing to a close, there still

ihasn’t been one protest tendered
iLeo C. Bemis, IM head. His ex-

planation “better of-

ﬁciating.”

is simply

To assure continued good of-

ﬁciating, the boys who do the ar-
bitrating have organized the Pitt
Oﬁicials Association. Still in em-
bryonic stage, the POA has set its
sights on a glittering future.

The ﬁve-man executive com-

mittee hopes the future will bring
an unique organization set "up.
With contacts made by Bemis, the
POA hopes to spread out in the
officiating ﬁeld.

Through the experience gained
by POA members in the IM
sports, Bemis hopes to make con-
tacts with settlement and com-
munity houses. This‘ will give the

officials a chance to broaden their
experience and at the same time
fatten their pocktbooks.

As for the present, the POA ex-
ecutive committee, headed by
Myron Kopelman, is working on
reorganization. Clinics and panel
discussion to encompass all sports
are being planned.

There is still quite a bit to do
before the plans begin to mater-
ialize.

The ﬁrst is to increase the
membership. This will be done,

the committee has decided, by
screening the applicants.

This screening process will take
place only after the applicants
have attended the clinics. To keep
the oﬁiciating on a high level, the
POA will insist on a thorough
knowledge of both the sport
and the rules.‘ ,

Anyone who is interested is,
urged to contact Bemis, Kopelman,’

or any of the other executive
members, Merle Farabaugh, Bob
Forman, and Sam Shapiro.
