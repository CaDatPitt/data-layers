One of America is greatest student newspapers — since I 906

VOLUME XCVIII, NUMBER 120

Roberts covers moms, election

NIKKI SCHWAB
Senior Staff Writer

As one of the most prominent journalists of this era,
Cokie Roberts does not give herself much credit.

“I don’t want to pretend I’m cozy with the presi-
dents,” she said.’ I ”

Roberts spoke Wednesday evening to a large audience

at Heinz Hall. She came to Pittsburgh as part of Robert
Morris University’s Pittsburgh Speaker Series,’ which

. brings in seven world and cultural leaders every year.

Her journalistic resume includes working for ABC
News as a chief congressional analyst and a co-anchor
with Sam Donaldson for the program, “This Week with
Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts.” She also is a senior
political analyst for National Public Radio.

Roberts began ﬂie evening by talking about her two
books, “We Are Our Mothers’ Daughters,” published in
1998, and “Founding Mothers” which she “just ﬁnished.”

She admitted the hardest-thing involved in the publi-
cation of her ﬁrst book -was creating a title. She chose “We
Are Our Mothers’ Daughters” because the book focused
on women’s relationships throughout the generations of

She asked her editor’s opinion on the book title, and
the editor replied, “I am NOT my mother’s daughter.”

But Roberts kept the name for her ﬁrst book, saying
that mothers would like the title, if not daughters.

Her more recent work, “Founding Mothers,” tells the
stories of the women who helped create the United States.

She explained that Robert Morris, the founding father
for whom the University is named, , actually ended up in
debtors’ prison. While having dinner with George and
Martha Washington, his wife, Mary, had something to do
with the decision to move the nation’s capital from New
York to Philadelphia.

During the dinner, the cream had spoiled, and Mary
said, “We’ve got to move the capital to Philadelphia. You
can’t get any cream in New York,” Roberts explained.

Roberts spent the majority of the evening giving her
analysis of the upcoming presidential election. .

She said that George W. Bush has a tremendous

‘advantage over Democratic challengers because he is

already the president.
Presidential hopeful Sen. John Kerry, D—Mass., also
has a Senate voting record that could be used against him,

Cokie Roberts discussed, appropriately, Robert'Mo and his

American history.

Dialogue among

This isn’t the start of a joke, but a description of
the speakers at Tuesday night’s Interfaith Dialogue
Meeting. ‘
Rabbi Jamie Gibson, Pastor David Keller and
Dr. Karen Velazquez spoke as representatives of
their faiths at a “natural meeting of friends,” orga-

together by the topic of nature in each of their

War addictions keep some correspondents hooked

LAURA J ERPI
Staff Writer

A male war correspondent
admitted that going to war was dan-
gerous. I ‘

He explained that he couldn’t
bear to send someone else in his
place, because he wouldn’t be able

' to live with himself if his replace-

ment got hurt.

Only he could go, because"

going to war was his job, and no one
could take it away. The risk was
great, but he didn’t care. ,
Carrie‘ Rentschler, a visiting
assistant professor in Pitt’s Women
Studies Program, described the
power of war in a lecture, “Addicted
to War: Masculinity and War
Correspondence,” on Wednesday. ' -
7 ‘ “Addiction~is a way to justify
what seems unjustifiable in war cor-
respondents,” she said. .
Rentschler explored the autobi-

ographies of numerous war corre-
spondents to find a link between
masculinity and war. She found
that, in many cases, myths of war
are deﬁned through acts of mascu-
line heroism. According to
Rentschler, it seems -as if many war
correspondents use their jobs to feed
their own hidden addictions to war.
“War is like a hard drug abuse,”
one correspondent told Rentschler,
echoing the words of the many cor-
respondents who compared their
war addictions to drug addictions.
Rentschler used a book written
by Chris Hedges, “War is a Force
that Gives Us Meaning,” as an
example. In his book, Hedges shares

his personal experiences as a war '

correspondent.

“In the beginning, war looks
and feels like love, but gives noth-
ing in return,” Hedges wrote.

Rentschler also brought up the
idea that war correspondents tend to

feel a tight bond with each other.

She compared their bond to the

bond of soldiers who go to war
together. —

Gender and the uses of power
involved in gender have always
interested Rentschler, she said.
Some of her lecture material came
from a larger project called
“Joumalism and Trauma,” which
she is currently working on.

How members of news corre-
spondence report on issues relating
to war and trauma, in particular,
grabbed Rentschler’s interest. She

explained that she examined the
idea of “war correspondence as a»

practice, not a product.” '

In her closing ,, remarks,
Rentschler compared being sober,
for an alcoholic, with being away
from war, for a war correspondent.
For both, being away from their
addictions brings out their great
fears of reality, she said.

Senate record, minority votes
could challenge, Roberts says

Roberts, page 1

Roberts acknowledged._

“A Senate voting record is a terrible
 for“'a”"presidential candidate,” ‘ she
said. “It’s interesting, because members
of the Senate don’t seem to notice.”

‘Only two other presidents were
elected directly from the Senate, one
being John F. Kennedy. But Kennedy
was not a member for long, and his back
problems limited the votes he could cast
while there. K

“John Kerry has a disadvantage
because he actually showed up,” Roberts
said. '

V Roberts said the Democrats were
becoming “feisty”. because of their lead
in the polls against Bush, but she added
that polling is not particularly reliable
and represents how a person feels in the
15 minutes the poll is being taken.

She also said that Ralph Nader does
matter. _ "

“He just ,can’t help himself [from
entering the race] ,” she explained.

Nader, she said, was wrong in say-
ing that he would take voters away from
both the Democrats and the
Republicans. ‘

She went on to point out that, just as
the Senate voting record will hinder the
Democrats, obtaining the minority vote

will challenge Bush as he seeks to retain
the presidency.

“Ihere are just not enough white
guys to go around, “ she said.

Her analysis was followed by a
question—and-answer session.

An audience member asked Roberts
if there is indeed a liberal media and, if

‘so, where it is. Roberts replied that there

was more fair criticism 20 or 30 years
ago, but that there is a very conscious
effort to present conservative voices in
the media today. She reﬂected that her
own personal biases only included ﬁnd-
ing a good story and getting out of the
Congressional chambers before dinner.

Another person questioned the pos-
sibility that the Constitutional amend-
ment banning gay marriage could pass.
Roberts said that there might be a possi-
bility in the future, but added that this
would be only the second amendment
passed to restrict a right.

The first was the 18th Amendment,
which enacted prohibition.

“That didn’t work very well,” she
said. '

For not being’ particularly “cozy”
with the presidents, Roberts shared a
plethora of information about politics for
almost two hours.

“It’s going to be an interesting year
to watch,” she said. “Stay tuned.”

God—nature relationship discussed

Interfaith, page _1 ,_

holding tightly to their _mothers to
Abercrombie and Fitch-wearing college
students, to Muslim women with hijabs
covering their hair. Those gathered togeth-
er were ready for a night of enlightenment
and open-Inindedness. With a scenic
backdrop and gentle nature sounds ﬂow-
ing through the room, Posvar Hall was
transformed into a forum for growth ‘and
learning.

Gibson opened the discussiom speak-
ing about the praise Jews give to God for
the earth, air, sky and nature. He recited
several Psalms, most in Hebrew as well as
in English, giving the spectators a bit of
culture along with the religion. ‘

For Gibson, much of the power of the
Torah, Bible, and Quran is in their original
languages, where he said the true meaning
of the text could be found. The Jewish
people praise their Lord day and night for
the beauty He has given them, Gibson
explained, adding that they-believe it is
their responsibility to “act as God’s stead,
(His) agent to care for the worl .”

Keller wove Islam and Judaism
together with his words. As a man who

‘ ﬁnds Islamic ‘beliefs fascinating, he

expressed his desire to understand Islamic
thought on nature and its oneness.

“Christianity’s understanding of
nature is found in Psalms,” Keller said.

Like Gibson, Keller read numerous
Psalms, describing them as “expressions
of oneness’ with nature.” He explained
how many of his contacts have told him
how they ﬁnd God in nature, and how he,
too, feels closest to God in a natural" set-
ting. ‘ . '
Keller spends much of his devotional
time each morning swimming at the
Jewish Community Center, on his back,
reciting 20 Psalms. His ﬁnal words
encouraged the spectators to praise their
God for all of creation.

Velazquez linked personal experience
to her beliefs about nature. After citing the
Webster’s definition «of nature, ‘she
expanded on the "oneness of man with
nature through the Quran, reading pas-
sages about signs that can be found in cre-
ation from Allah for believers. She
explained how Allah “invites us to think
how we, as humans in the universe, come
to exist and how we exist today.”

She encouraged everyone to think
outside of traditional teachings, and to
look at the world as a whole in nature.

Victims bill redefines when life begins

The United States House of
Representatives has answered a ques-
tion long—debated by abortion rights-
and anti-abortion groups: When does
human life begin?

Yesterday, the House passed the
Unborn Victims of Violence Act — des-
ignated Laci and Conner’s Law, after
Laci Peterson and her unborn son, who
were killed in California — that would
grant unborn children victim’s rights.

If passed, the law would mean that
if a pregnant woman were murdered,
her killer could be charged with a dou-
ble murder, rather than one murder.
House Democrats offered an alternate
bill, one in which the killer would be
charged with killing one person, but-
with more severe penalties than current-
ly exist.

Convicting someone of two mur-
ders does not vastly differ from convict-
ing them of one. If the Democrats’ ver-
sion passed, it would be equal in its
effects, without redeﬁning when life
begins.

Abortion rights activists are wor-
ried that this law grants rights to a fetus,
by recognizing an unborn child as fully
human, and could be used to justify
banning abortion. And considering that
the National Right to Life Committee
lobbied for this legislation, these advo-
cates might have a case.

But, while this slippery slope idea

A may not be applicable, there is reason to

worry, since the bill defines when
human life begins:

An “unborn child” is any “member
of the species Homo sapiens, at any
stage of development, who is carried in
the worn .” _

This could lead to vagaries con-
cerning the interpretation of the law.
For instance, if a woman pregnant with
twins were killed, would this count as a
triple murder? And, if someone killed a
woman who was unaware that she was
pregnant — as was her killer + would
his intent matter in what he was con-
victed of? '

Human life should not be redeﬁned
so breezily, and without regard to cur-
rent medical standards or the U.S.
Constitution. The 14th Amendment

extends “equal protection under the

law” to all people “born or naturalized
in the United States,” but this law seems
to contradict the “bom” part of this, by
extending rights to the unborn as sepa-
rate citizens.

Violence against women, especially
pregnant women, is a cause for national
concern. But passing the legislation will
not end such violence; instead, it will
only throw more gasoline onto the
already ﬁery debate over when human
life begins.

Two similar bills have been passed
by the House, but tabled by the Senate.
Hopefully, given this bill’s inadequa-
cies, they will be three-for-three.

Green Party should act as a political
party and nominate its own candidate

I feel the need to refute your

Feb. 23’s The Pitt News.

First of all, you seem to imply
that Nader is the Green Party’s candi-
date for President. That he is not. The
Green Party has yet to nominate a
candidate for president, and because
he pulled out in December, Ralph
Nader will probably notbe the nomi-
nee. Ralph Nader entered the race
Sunday, not as the Green Party candi-
date, but as an Independent. That is,
he’s not representing a political party.

So, that’s your first factual mis-
take.

Your second factual mistake is in
believing the Green Party is not a
political party but an interest group.
A political party’s purpose is to pro-
vide candidates for elected ofﬁce.

isn’t interested in endorsing anyone;
they’re in the business of running
candidates in elections, including

. presidential candidates to the voters
who will adhere to the party platform
if elected. The Green Party won’t
endorse Nader! And they sure as hell
won’t endorse Kerry! They don’t
endorse other parties’ candidates! If
you think the Green Party’s interests
are served by not being a political
party, you’re on crack.

Animals: Sentient, not swallow-able

The title and tone of the recent
article on the bio-engineered gloﬁsh
(“Gloﬁsh: You donft want to swallow
40 of these,” Feb. 18, Nick Kratsas)
left much to be desired. While well-
executed journalism has an obliga-
tion to objectively present an issue,‘I
feel that Kratsas fell short of this in
failing to address how, both ethically
and physically, bio-engineering has a
negative effect on the animals them-
selves. : -

The idea that the ethics of genet- ,
'_ ically manipulating and altering wild

animals for human entertainment and
profit even needs to be debated
shows how far our View of other ani-
mals needs to evolve. ‘

- Fish, like all vertebrates, are sen-

tient beings. Many ﬁsh are long-.
lived, have complicated nervous sys- -

tems and are capable of learning
complicated tasks. They deserve
more than becoming life-long prison-

ers of the pet trade and laboratories, '

tormented and killed for food, or tor-
tured and swallowed in college
pranks. Kratsas’ article worksqsolely
from the premise that nature and
other animals exist merely to serve
our selﬁsh desires without the need
for consideration in theirown right.
This anthropocentric ideal is the dis-
ease. A genetically modified, captive

glofish existing to be gawked at in V

our homes is just another symptom.

Sincerely,

Feminism is about seeing women as equals, not doormats

I am a feminist.

Furthermore, I hate Howard Stern.

I will wait for the clamor to settle; I realize I have
now blasphemed twice in succession in this, our col-
lege culture. '

Please note that I am neither a lesbian, nor a man-
hater, nor —- though some might argue
otherwise —-— am I even a woman. My
problem is with Stern’s —— and society’s
—- objectification, condescension and
general treatment of women.

Feminism carries a stigma nowadays.
Forgotten are the fruits of Rosie the
Riveter and the feminist movement —
suffrage, the beginnings of access to
higher education and business and gov-
ernmental positions. What remains is
backlash, springing from the decision‘ to
legalize abortion, which has been able to
successfully paint feminism -——- to both
men and women —— as radical and hostile, man-hating
and silly.

In 2001, a Gallup poll found that only 25 percent
of women identiﬁed themselves as feminists, yet
more than 66 percent of them thought that equal
opportunity in the workplace has not been achieved
and 37 percent were dissatisﬁed with their treatment
in society. Since the concern about feminist issues
has not diminished — even if the number of people
who identify themselves as feminists has ——. the ques-
tion is not whether feminism is still relevant, but
rather, what exactly does it constitute?

 

Pedja Jurisic
Colurrmist

According to the United States Census Bureau,
women make 78 cents for every dollar men make,

and that is when differences in age, location, educa— )

tion and hours worked are accounted for. That totals
a loss of $250,000 — per woman — over the course
of a career. While women constitute almost half of
the work force, they constitute only 29
percent of lawyers, 24 percent of doctors
and only 15.7 percent of corporate ofﬁ-
cers of Fortune 500 "companies. In the
political arena, women occupy only 14
percent of Senate seats; in the House of
Representatives, it’s 13 percent.

Yet, feminism is not about political
power or even economic equality, nor is it
about female empowerment — not inher—
ently at least. Essentially, it is about
choice, the liberty to act as an individual,
without stigmatization grounded on the
basis of gender. As -for the problems
above, solving these are merely prerequisites for
equality, feminism’s ambitious goal.

Despite its critics, feminism certainly has a role
in depicting marriage, religions and government as
institutions that have promoted viewing women as
subordinate, second—class citizens. Still, while these
broader complexities deserve their due attention, the
deﬁnition of -feminism as a movement lies in its goal
to further the prospects for the individual female and
her situation. .

Feminism, then, is about each woman, rather than
women as a group. It is about establishing indepen-

dence from male control, approval and inﬂuence, so
as to liberate each woman from her social constraints.

It concerns major issues. It is about determining
your role within your family, not having one super-
imposed by society. It is about pursuing a career,
without a ceiling placed at the outset. It is about hav-
ing your intellect revered,.not just your body. It is
about considering a woman as a man’s equal, as a
society.

And it is about smaller things,

It is about not having to obsess about every
spoonful of ice cream, every bite of candy, every
calorie taken in.‘It is about not wearing mini skirts
and tank tops in early January, when the temperature
is in single digits, to impress guys at frat parties. It is
about enjoying sex‘ with ﬁve, 10,‘20 guys without
being labeled a slut, or remaining abstinent without
being labeled a prude. It is about feeling free towrite
sex columns or soliloquize about vaginas.

But it is about feeling free, first and foremost; it
is about choice.

We have all done our share of perpetuating
female stereotypes — myself included —- and maybe
my interpretation of feminism does not suffice. But,
as author Rebecca West said, “I  have never been
able to ﬁndfiqut precisely what feminism is. I only
know that people call me a feminist when I express
sentiments that differentiate [women] from a door-
mat, or a prostitute.” 1 ' ’

Don’t participate in a segregated system — don’t get married

Two of my friends got married on

What then can be done, to ensure

that one, Mr. President.

to espouse — family, love and equality

Ash Wednesday. They took their vows
before many witnesses, kissed (and
kissed and kissed), and got the tradition-
al stemware—coffee table book-linens
presents.

Why is this then so remarkable? It’s
not because neither wore white -—- it’s
after Labor Day, after all — but because
my friends, Becky and Isa, are women,
and now, wives. _

First, let me congratulate them.
They’re perfect for each other, each
ﬁercely intelligent and funny, and they
do what couples should — drive each
other toward sanity. The wedding was
the best I’ve ever been to. The brides
laughed their way to the altar. I wish
them years of happiness together.

I wish I could say that their marriage
would be like any other, but unfortunate-
ly we live in a country in which marriage
is a segregated system, biased against
those who don’t conform to the “one
man + one woman = true luv!!!” equa-
tion. ,

And whenever an issue polarizes
people, it leaves those who sympathize
with the discriminated-against —— whites_
who favored integration, straight people
who want legal gay marriage —— uncom-
fortably stuck between both sides, part of
the majority, but sympathizing strongly

‘with the minority.

Becky, Isa, and all other couples the
same rights that I as a (rela-
tively) heterosexual person
am granted? I can vote
against “protection of mar-
riage” acts, or whatever other
bigotry is disguised as bills. I
can give money and time to
organizations devoted to
stopping‘ the President
George W. Bush-endorsed,
one—man-one-woman
Constitutional amendment.

And I can refuse to par-
ticipate in a segregated sys-
tem.

That is, until Becky and Isa can
legally marry, in every state, territory
and protectorate belonging to the United
States, I will not get married. And I hope
that others will join me.

I ﬁnd it odd that many people are
arguing against gay marriage as if it were
a concept like, _say, justice or tasty, low-
fat cheese. Marriage is not a concept; it’s
a bond between two people. To be
opposed to gay marriage is to be
opposed to people, the creation of fami-
lies, — -stable, loving, child-adopting,
tax-break-beneﬁting and medica1—care-
receiving families. To sum: Being
opposed to ‘gay marriage is being
opposed to family values. Try to spin

- them an

’ At their wedding, Becky announced
that, if they could afford it,
they would go and establish
residency in Massachusetts,
then get legally married, in
Salem, on Halloween.
They’ll jump through what-
ever hoops state and nation-
al governments offer, just to

binding.

But they shouldn’t have
to move just to get married.
They should be able to get
married right here, and
receive all the beneﬁts that all other
young married couples do.

In light of their hoop jumping, I
decided not to buy Becky and Isa match-
ing Harry Potter T—shirts. Instead, I got
. e—mail address
(marriage_of_equals@yahoo.com), so
that others could pledge not to get mar-
ried until they can.

It’s important to make marriage
about people’s decisions and their inter-
actions with the government andhealth
care providers, nothing more or less.

And gay marriage isn’t solely a gay
‘issue; it’s a human rights issue. Gay cou-
ples are going to live together and raise

children, and generally perpetuate all the

values that the United States is supposed

_ make their vows legally

—— regardless of what Sen. Rick
Santorum, R-Pa., and Bush want.

So support human rights and drop
Becky and Isa an e—mail. And live the
changes you want to see in the world, by
refusing to take part in a discriminatory
system, and informing politicians that
you’re onto their. game — that when
they’re against gay marriage, they’re‘
against family values. _

Just-as a side note, I’d like to con-
gratulate another gay couple, Wendell
and Cass, .who’ve been together for four
years and are raising a child together.
Avid Columbia University News Service
readers will know that Wendell and Cass
are not just any gay'couple — they’re pen-
guins, proving that, not only are there
homosexual non-human animals, but
there are also ‘commitment-oriented
homosexual non-human animals.

Cass, Wendell, if you crazy birds
ever decide to get married, don’t squab-
ble over who’s going to - wear white.
After all, you both already own the
tuxes.

Drop an i _. e—mail ' to
marriage_0f_equals@yah00.com to
show your support for Becky and Isa,
and pledge not to participate in a segre-
gated ‘ system. E-mail Sydney at

Predicting who walks home with Oscar

DANTE A. CIAMPAGLIA
A&E Editor

Here we are, at the culmination
of the 2003 movie year. The
Academy Awards are Sunday, and
there is much debate over every
facet of them.

Is “Mystic River,” “Lost in
Translation” or “Return of the
King” the best film of the year?
Who’ll walk away with the Best
Actor statue — Sean Penn or Bill
Murray? Why is Joan Rivers still a
relevant fixture on the red carpet?

Of course, no one but the
accountants counting the ballots
knows who has won. But that didn’t
stop the film writers at The Pitt
News from getting together to have
our own little vote. The six film
writers all voted on the following
categories: Best Picture, Best
Director, Best Actor, Best Actress,
Best Supporting Actor, Best
Supporting Actress, Best Original
Screenplay, Best Adapted
Screenplay and Best Animated
Film. Below are the results. Debate
and argue, agree or disagree — then
watch the Oscars on Sunday to see
how accurate we were.

Best Animated Film: “Finding
Nemo” .

The only other film in this cate- .

gory that could give Pixar’s latest
masterpiece a challenge is “The
Triplets of Belleville.” But, honest-
ly, is there any contest here? No
way. “Finding Nemo,” the latest
gem from one of the best movie
houses in operation, appealed to
kids and adults and more than satis-
fied both. Plus, the animation was
amazing.

Best Adapted Screenplay: “The
Lord of the Rings: Return of the
King”

The unfilmable trilogy was
wrapped up this year, and more than
anything else, the “Rings” films
receive massive kudos for their
screenplays. Anyone who could dis-
till those huge, epic books into
something manageable, without los-
ing the ‘epic scope, should be
rewarded. And this year, the screen-
writers behind not only “Return of
the King,” but also the entire trilo-
gy, will have Oscar gold bestowed
on them.

Best Original Screenplay: “Lost in
Translation”

“Lost in Translation” showed
that the filmmaking gene does run
through the Coppola lineage, as
Sophia, daughter of Francis
Ford, ﬂexed her abilities as a
filmmaker. But more impres-
sive than her visual language
was her script for the film,
which maneuvered easily
between comedy and drama.
Best of all, two char-
acters were created
on the page — and
brought to life by
Bill Murray and
Scarlett Johansson
— who will live on
in the hearts and
minds of film fans ..
for years to come.

Best Supporting
Actress: Marcia Gay
Harden, “Mystic River” 
The supporting acting
categories are never a
given on Oscar night, and
that tradition held true
with our voting. Four of
the five nominees
received votes, but Marcia .
Gay Harden ended up get- 4,
ting the nod for her .role in
Clint Eastwood’s brilliant
“Mystic River.” In a film
stacked with great perfor-
mances, Harden stood out
as the sympathetic and emo-
tional wife of Tim Robbins.

Best Supporting Actor: Tim
Robbins, “Mystic River”
How convenient, then, that
Harden’s on-screen, husband 
also receive an Oscar for “is\": 
role in “Mystic '
River.” But, like
with Supporting
Actress, this was-
n’t a runaway.
Robbins and Alec ,
Baldwin were neck ‘
and neck, but

 
 
  
 
  
 
  
   
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
  
    
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
 
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
  

vailed. And ‘why not? It’s about
time this great American actor gets
some recognition from the
Academy.
Best Actress: Charlize Theron,
“Monster” .
Charlize Theron, trans-
formed herself from sexy
Hollywood superstar to unat-
tractive serial killer with
shocking case. And such
transformations are
usually honored by
the Academy (see:
_ Nicolas Cage’s
‘against—type por-
. trayal of a drunk in
' “Leaving Las
Vegas). This’ time
will be no different.
Especially because,
 honestly, who knew
Theron had such a
performance in her?
With such films as
“Mighty Joe Young.”
and “The Astronaut’s
Wife” to her credit, she
wasn’t really able to
show off her acting
chops.
Best Actor: Bill Murray,
“Lost in Translation”
-With “Rushmore,”
Bill Murray showed he’s
not just a comedian try-
ing to break into drama.
And with “Lost in
Translation,” Murray
showed why he’s one of
the best actors working
today. He does so much
int-rovert acting here -
-choosing to express things
with body movements and
eye movements
 especially
that it’s as if
we’re watching
Bill Murray and
not the charac-
ter. He’s so nat-
ural on screen.

 
 

Robbins’ dynamic There’s some
portrayal of a tough com-
middle-aged petitidn in

the psyche g 0 r y ,

tude of a  S e a n
Chlld pm‘ COURTESYAMPAS Penn also

nominated for his excellent perfor-

mance in “Mystic Rive_r,” but

Murray wins it, hands down.

Best Director: Peter Jackson, “The
Lord of the Rings: Return of the
King”

Peter Jackson did the unthink-
able for_legions of “Lord of the
Rings” fans — adapted the books
into films that aren’t only enjoyable
but also unbelievable technical
achievements. He missed winning
this award for “Fellowship of the
Ring,” but that won’t happen again
— especially because there are no
more “Rings” films to be had and
this is the Academy’s last chance to
honor J ackson’s achievement.

Best Picture: “The Lord of the
Rings: Return of the King”

Both “Fellowship” and “The
Two Towers” were nominated for
this award, and both lost. But this

time will be different. Like with-

Jackson winningfor Best Director,
the Academy will honor the entire

,_trilogy by giving the Best ‘Picture

award to “Return of the King.” This
will be a marked difference for a
group that never gives such‘awards
to fantasy films. But because ‘of
how well-all these films are made,
and how well they’ve been received
by the film world and audiencespin
general, the Academy will make an

_ exception.

The Union is rockin’ out in the house with WPT S

Interested in putting faces to the music
you’ve heard being spun on WPTS? You’re in
luck. '

WPTS will host its first annual In-House
Showcase in the William Pitt Union on Friday,

_featuring local groups from of. practically any

kind imaginable, from a cappella to hardcore.

The Sounds of Pleasure, Pitt’s a cappella
group, will demonstrate their unique interpreta-
tions of everything from oldies to current pop
hits. Who says you need instruments when you’ve
got the lovely harmonies of these ladies?

If it’s rock you’re interested in, WPTS is
offering you two chances to hear some of the best
in town. We’re Wolves and the Montanimals will

\

both be performing their original songs, at the
event. And for all you hardcore die-hards out
there, Anchorage, a band hailing from
Greensburg, _will be making its Pittsburgh debut
Friday night, while Manshaft will explore the
emotional depths of noise music and just letting
sounds speak for themselves, providing listeners
with a charged, chaotic experience. _

For hip-hop fans, there is the duo Public
Access, made up of J. Pitts (MC) and Nice Record
Work (DJ). They will be bringing their under-
groundstyle to Pitt’s campus at the Showcase.
And The Wrestling Team isn’t even musical at all.
In fact, it’s a comedy act comprised of Andrew

Beckerman and Mark Charles Bisi, Jr., dedicated

to the purpose of making you laugh until you pee.

Don’t just sit around your dorm room this
Friday night, or do the regular things like spend-
ing absurd amounts of money at the movies on
tickets and popcorn. Instead, head to the Union to
hear what the Pittsburgh music scene is all about.

The 1st Annual In-House Showcase is Friday,
Feb. 27 at 8:30 p.m. in 4]] WPU. Tickets are $2.
And just in case you needed any more encourage-
ment, Pulp Magazine and BMW will bring a MINI
Cooper to the front of the Union for ticket give-
aways and photo ops.

List #5: Bruce gets freaky on a cold mountain with Nemo

ASHLEY WILLIAMS
Staff Writer

Ever had a question that remained
unanswered for way too long? For
me, that question stemmed from top
10 lists — best movies, best
songs, best ways to turn down

While this film is nothing like my

life at 13 ’— or now, come to think of

it — it’s nonetheless a very gripping
view of the difference in teen-agers

between now and 10 years ago. With

a gritty and raw, director Catherine

looks like Jim Carrey may finally be
back on track. As television reporter

Bruce Nolan, Carrey has his first real— ‘

fly funny‘ movie inlajlong time. After
being given God"s powers, he’s able

to pull out all the comic stops,

Morgan Freeman, who plays

a guy without crushing him
while still being assured that
he got that you were turning
him down. But I digress.

For years now, I’ve been
reading top 10 lists that leave
me wondering —— who was the
reviewer, why did their opin-
ion matter and what were they
smoking when they made the
list? Well, finally, it’s my turn
to do the reviewing and some-
one else’s turn to ask the
questions. So, without further
ado, here are my top 10
movies of 2003, in no particu-
lar order.

“Cold Mountain”

Yes, it’s received a lot of
hype, and yes, it deserves it.
What could have been a com-
pletely depressing film is
instead humorous and touch-
ing as director Anthony
Minghella gives us the chann-
'ng nuances of family life
next to the devastation of war.
Jude Law and Nicole Kidman
are captivating as separated
lovers, and Renee Zellweger’s por-
trayal of rough-around-the-edges
Ruby is hilarious. Also enjoyable is
the Jack White cameo.

Anyone who saw the 1995 TV
version and hated it can rest assured
that the remake is a thousand times
better. Jamie Lee Curtis replaces
annoying Shelly Long and a rock
band takes the place of boring swim
meets. Lindsay Lohan is charming as
always, and Chad Michael Murray of
“One Tree Hill” fame is gorgeous as
her love interest, Jake. Good, clean
family films haven’t been this fun in a
while.

“Lord of the Rings: Return of the
King”

Peter Jackson has achieved the
impossible — a third installment of a
trilogy that doesn’t suck. The only
bad thing aboutthis film is that the
journey, sadly, is over. The film is full
of action, drama and breathtaking
scenery: Orlando, Viggo and my
favorite hobbit, Billy Boyd (Pippin).
Oh, I’m sorry. Did you think I was
referring to mountains?

“Thirteen”

' true and sometimes

it.

COURTESY Fox SEARCHLIGHT PICTURE

Harwicke glosses over nothing.
Emotion ﬂies across the screen and
knockout performances from Evan

Rachel Wood and Holly Hunter leave .

you breathless.

“Big Fish”

Director Tim
Burton wows with a
tale that’s sometimes

not — half the fun is
figuring out which is
which. The cine-
matography is beauti-
ful, with lush colors
and whimsical
details. If you’re one
of those people who
like things to be real-
istic, don’t see this
film. If, however,
you’re more inclined
to walk around with
your head in the
clouds, this one’s for
you. '

“Bruce Almighty”
With lots of

laughs and a nice les-

son at the end, it

l

-God (who can argue with
that?), and Carrey work Well
together, and Jennifer Aniston
is greatiasv girlfriend, Grace.

“Finding Nemo” _
As much as I’m against the
whole V idea of abandoning
illustrated cartoons for those
V . with computer graphics, I can’t
deny that this is a great movie.
This film is full of the likeable
comic sidekicks that make

Ellen DeGeneres is beyond
funny as the voice of Dory, an
absent-minded fish. Also hilar-
ious‘ is Crush, an Australian
sea turtle voiced by Andrew
Stanton. ' V

“How To Lose A Guy In Ten
Days” '

Cheesy? Yes. Predictable?
Yes. - Unbelievably cutesy?
Yes. But in spite of all these
things, it’s also pretty good.
Kate_Hudson is charming,
Matthew McConaughey is gor-
geous and together, the two
light up the screen. Excuse the
sappy writing; it goes with the sappy
film. And besides, any film that busts
out Gin Blossoms for the final chase
scene is cool by me.

" 5::

“Something’s Gotta Give”

classic Disney films so great.-

Any movie that shows me Jack
Nicholson’s backside and a full
frontal View of Diane Keaton and still

gm-akesi imeleave with‘ a smile on my

face is a keeper. Both actors are fan-
tastic in this romantic, comedy. Also

surprisingly” good is Keanu Reeves,

who actually shows emotion — gasp!
——p— in his portrayal of Keaton’s other
love interest. While many of the
younger generation may write this off
as anold people’s ﬂick, it’s pretty

«universal. As it turns out, old people
' are just as messed up about love as we /

are.

“Whale Rider” ,

_ The surprise success of the year,
this film tells the story of the Maoris,
a native tribe of New Zealand. This
tale of love, rejection and triumph
follows Paikea, a young Maori girl
fighting to fulfill a destiny that her
family refuses to recognize. The
depictions of Maori culture are
refreshingly accurate and unapolo-
getic, and Niki Caro’s direction is
dead-on. Heartfelt and honest, this is
not a film to miss.

And now a few ﬂops. “Le
Divorce,” though billed as a romantic
comedy, is actually somewhat
depressing, without being insightful.
“Sylvia” is melodramatic and border-
line painful to watch after the sheer
beauty of last year’s writer ﬂick, “The
Hours.” “Beyond Borders” is good, as
long as you only watch the first half,
and “Legally Blonde 2,” well, it’s just
a mistake.

And there you have it~— the top
10 of 2003 according to me. Feel free
to sit and wonder.

East) wpillhave to tplaytwo solid
halves against Syracuse (18.-.6, 8-5).
Against’ Georgetown, ‘Pitt played a
poor first half, scoring only 20
points -- the lowestgfirsti-7half total
for the Panthers all year. 7

“We have. guys who believe in
each other and believe in what we

are doing and I think that has a lot
to do with [how Pitt overcomes
tough times],” Panthers head coach
Jamie Dixon said, when asked
about his team’s poise through
adversity.

Syracuse players have also
shown poise, not giving up despite
their tough losses. The Orangemen

,.-are on the bubble for the NCAA

tournament, and every game is a
must-win for them. That is why
they are a dangerous team to play.
Another reason to fear the
Orangemen is because of players on
their team who are stepping up, like
forward Hakim Warrick, who won
co-Big East Player of the Week
honors —— an honor that he shared
with U/Conn’s Emeka Okafor.
Warrick posted game highsin scor-
ing in both of last week’s games

ketball team. '-    A.

Saturday marks the final road trip‘ of
the season for the Panthers, as they head
to Blacksburg, Va., to take on No. 25
Virginia Tech. The Panthers need two
wins to even have a chance to ‘make the '
Big East Tournament. ‘ ~ . A '

“Until we are mathematically out 0
it, we are going to keep going as if we
are going to the tournament,” head coach .. 
Agnus Berenato said.   

Part of the reason for Pitt’s near
upset was the play of Stacy Moore.
Coming off the bench, Moore had eight
points and four assists, but her defensive
effort led to two steals and numerous
defensive stops for the Panthers. Saturday,
Moore will once again be called upon to
be the spark against the Hokies.

“When given the opportunity Stacy
[Moore] makes the most of it,” Berenato
said. “I think there were a couple games
she started and I don’t think that’s what
Stacy really needs. She knows she is a role
player. She feels like she is the spunk and
the spar .”

Page and Brown are key to Panther defense 
twelve    

The men’s basketball team
has fought back from two 13-
point deficits this season. It has
found ways to lull teams to sleep j
and then blow them out in the
final five minutes of the game.
Right now, Carl Krauser leads
the team in scoring, and fresh-
man phenom Chris Taft is headed
for Big East Rookie of the Year
honors.

. But this isn’t why Pitt is 25-2 and vying for a
No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament.

The reason is defense. As a wise man once
said, “defense wins championships.” Look at the
pitching of the Florida Marlins, the defense of the
New England Patriots, or the defense of the
Louisiana State football team for example.

Pitt will contend this year for the national

: championship because of its defense.

Against Georgetown Tuesday night, Julius
Page couldn’t hit a shot. Hell, he could only hit
half his free throws. Page has struggled with his
shot this year after coming off an ankle injury.
However, what never gets talked about or noticed
is his ability-to -defend the star‘ on the opposing
team. ’ A ‘

Both Jaron Brown and Page have gone up

 
 

against Ben Gordon, Herve
Lamizana, Chris Thomas, Gerry
McNamara, Gerald Riley, and
many others. .
The Pitt defense has held
18 of 28 opponents to under 60
points, and the Panthers ﬂat out
do not lose when they hold
1 opponents to under 60 points —
it’s been three years since this
last happened. ‘ -

At Syracuse, Page held McNamara to eight
points and only three-of-ll shooting. Coming. into
that game, McNamara was the leading scorer for
the Orangemen and the key to their success.
Page’s defense had a direct effect on the 21-point
victory. ~ _

For three years now, Page has been the back-
bone to Pitt’s defensive success. He prides himself
more on his defense then his offense.

Brown, who is 6 feet 4 inches tall, went up
against Lamizana for Rutgers who is almost 6

iinchestaller than Brown. Lamizana, who was

averaging 14.5 points per game going into the
match up with Pitt, was held to only six points and
three-of-12 shooting. ' ~ ' ,
The nation can talk up the Atlantic Coast
Conference and its games that _end with point

totals near the century mark. But what will happen
when these teams play a defensive—minded team
like Pitt?

If Pitt were to see the likes of Duke or Wake
Forest in the tournament, the matchup of defense
against offense would be a sight to see. Against
UConn, a running, high-scoring team, Jim
Calhoun tried to speed up the tempo of the game,
but Page and Brown would not let the Huskies’
guards run the ﬂoor.

After the game, Calhoun even said that he
tried- everything to speed up the game, but Pitt’s
defense just wouldn’t allow it.

Pittsburgh is a town that prides itself as a blue-
collar place. Heinz Field explodes with Terrible
Towels whirling after a sack or interception. The
defense gets cheered, louder than the offense.

. These Panthers represent this city, its blue-
collar nature and its defensive-minded sports
teams.

So the next time you see Page struggling from
the field or Chevon Troutman not scoring as much
as he should, look to the other end of the floor and
watch them play defense. It might just be more
exciting than watching Pitt play offense.

r

Oh, boy! I really can’t wait for
‘the summer to hit now_!« _

As if the facts that I’ve forgotten
what the sun looks like and have
been sick since the ball‘ dropped in
New York.weren’t enough motiva-
tion for meto be desperate for June,
now good, ol’ ABC-TV is combining
two of my favorite things. '

Reality television and Mark
Cuban! '

native ‘and Dallas ‘Mavericks owner
Mark Cuban is going to be hosting a

, reality television show called “The

Benefactor,” in which he gives away
one million dollars of his own
money ‘to, one of 30 lucky contes-
tants. I am ‘ecstatic! This is going to

be the best television since “Double.

Dare!’,’ ,
And just in case you can’t tell

That’s right,/' folks! Pittsburgh

whether or not I’m being sarcastic,
I’ll c1ear<it up for you: I would rather
stab myself in the eye repeatedly
with a spoon than watch “The
Benefactor.” , _

-I’veihad a hate-love relationship
from afar with Mark ‘Cuban ever
since he bought‘ the Mavericks in
2000. Every time I wanted to hate
him for being a whiny, self-
absorbed, obnoxious schmoe,‘ he
would turn around and do,something
that made me have to like him.

He makes an ass of himself at
games and gets fined repeatedly by

I the NBA: bad. He matches each fine

he is given with an equal contribu-
tion to a charitable organization:
good. ‘ ',

He says he wouldn’t hire the

: NBA’s head of officials to manage a

Dairy Queen: not cool. He later puts
his money where his mouth is, serv-
ing ice cream cones from behind the
counter of a Dallas Dairy Queen and
donating the proceeds to charity:
very cool. , ‘
He is H a prodding, intrusive
owner, who spends far too much
money on the best scorers he can
get, rather than hiring a- knowledge-

able general manager who can con-‘

struct a team that. can score, rebound ,

and play defense: moronic.
He is from‘Pittsburgh: how can I
hate the guy? '
But lately, Cuban’s actions have

' reminded me why I thought he was a

tool in the first place. It all started
last spring, when- he publicly stated
that he thought the Kobe Bryant sex-
ual assault scandal was good for the
NBA, because it gave the league
more exposure to television watch-
ers who usually didn’t fit its largest
watching demographic.

The insinuation that a rape case
of any type is good business is out-
rageous. Whatever the outcome of
Bryant’s trial, both his life and the
life of the young woman involved

, are going to be ruined forever. For

Cuban to pull the old “there’s no
such thing as bad publicity” cliche in
this situation is not only inappropri-
ate, but disrespectful to Bryant, who
is a member of the league that Cuban
has a large financial interest in.
Now, he further cements his sta-

tus as the biggest mediawhore since.

Metalli'ca by signing on to do anoth-
er horrible reality television show.
Cuban wasn’t content with simply
being rich when he invented broad-

 ittnewsmom

cast.com in the mid-‘90s; he wanted
to be famous as well. So he bought a
basketball team, not because he
loves basketball, but because he
wanted ‘the television exposure that
would come with ownership of the
Mavericks. He runs his basketball
team not as abasketball team, but as
a business. This never results in win-

ning titles, and if you don’t believe

me‘, ask Dan Snyder.

All of Cuban’s complaining has
resulted in a C-rate celebrity status,
which makes him the perfect candi-
date for a reality television show.
But for other owners, young and old,
here’s a thought: nobody cares about
you! .

You are suits and check—signers.'

Your job is to sit in a box, hire good
front office peoplewho are knowl-
edgeableiabout sports to do the hir-
ing and firing, and shut up. You are
not the attraction to a sporting event;
you are not the draw. Fans pay to see
athletes, not their owners ranting
and raving like a 10-year-old about a
traveling violation.

against Notre Dame (28) and
Georgetown (19).

However, Warrick has made
mistakes over the season. He aver-
ages three turnovers a game,and
had five against Georgetown.
According to The Post Standard,
Orangemen head coach Jim
Boeheim still has faith in Warrick.

“His turnovers are going up the
last couple of games bec_ause he’s
got to make plays for us,”.Boeheim
said. “There’s going to be times
where he’s going to take it in traf-
fic. He’s going to make some mis-
takes.”

Against Pitt, he
points and pulled down 10
rebounds. His 19.8 points per game
have him tied for the -team lead in
scoring with teammate Gerry
McNamara, who is also a threat to
Pitt.

Although McNamara had a sub-
par game against Pitt in January,
scoring only eight points, he can
still nail three-pointers in the clutch
—— like he did against Georgetown
as time expired, giving Syracuse
the 57-54 win.

McNamara has hit 77 three-
pointers this season, as compared to‘
the 29 three-pointers the rest of his

Pitt’s presence from behind the
arc has not gone unnoticed either.

In fact, Pitt has hit 126 three-
pointers this season ——- 20 more
than Syracuse. Carl Krauser and
Julius Page lead _the way with 41
and 49 threes, respectively.

Despite Pitt’s success with its
three-point shooting, the Panthers
beat Syracuse with 44. of the 66
points coming from the paint in the
first matchup. Forwards Chevon
Troutman and Mark McCarroll, as
well as Chris Taft, all finished in
double-digit scoring in that game.
They were forces to be reckoned
with, and Syracusehad no answer
for them. ‘ . - _

The one thing that they will
have to look out for is committing
fouls. Against Syracuse, Troutman,
McCarroll, and Taft all had four
fouls in the game. Center Toree
Morris received three foul calls in
his” eight minutes off the bench. A

The game‘ will boil down to

whether Pitt can control the paint.i

If the Panthers do, like they did a
month ago, they should head to the
locker room with their 41st win at
the Pete. ~

Pitt will host Syracuse at 4 p.m.
on Sunday and the game will be

Starting center Allisha Morris will
get the daunting task of guarding
Kublina. Morris, who has regained
her starting spot, has been on fire late-
ly as she has made layups and also has
been connecting on 10-foot jumpers. _
“It’s in Allisha’s game‘ to take

three-point shots; she just won’t take,

them,” Berenato said: “She has a
problem with her confidence. I’ve
been trying to gether to just play.”

Latoya Kincaid doesn’t have a’

problem with her confidence. She is
the leading scorer for the Panthers.
Last Saturday, Kincaid scored ,’»a
game-high 24, points and had thrtee

steals. When the Hokies visited Pitt in \_ ,
January, Kincaidcame closeto a dou-
ble-double with 10 points and eight‘

rebounds; ~

“Latoya did a phenomenal job
against Notre Dame,” Berenato said.
“They could not stop her. But we need
everyone to play well.”

Pitt will need a team effort
Saturday to defeat the Hokies. Game
time is 2:30 in Cassell Coliseum.
