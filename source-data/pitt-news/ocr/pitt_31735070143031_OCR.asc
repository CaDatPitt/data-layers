answered questions about the H1N1
virus in separate interviews with
The PittNews yesterday. Below is a
compilation of their remarks.

TPN: How dangerous is the swine
ﬂu?

Skinner: For some people, par-
ticularly for people with underlying
health conditions, it can be serious.
For most people, they’re going to
feel terrible for a few days — some
people describe it as being hit by a
train —— but, after a few days, they’ll
be ﬁne.

TPN: How will the virus affect
the lives of college students?

Stebbins: It may be disruptive,
without necessarily being danger-
ous. If enough students get sick at

then narrow it down to six groups and
then to three, before participating in

“The numbers are narrowed down

Swine ﬂu 4 1

once, you may go through a phase where
you’re disrupting some classes.

TPN: How many Pitt students do you pre-
dict will contract swine ﬂu this year?

Stebbins: We could easily see between one-
quarter to one-third of the campus infected.
Many of them will have really mild symp-
toms. There are going to be enough cases at
Pitt where some students will get sick enough
to be hospitalized.

TPN: What should someone do if they

a"mu.rs  

think they might have swine ﬂu?

Stebbins: If students feel that they may have
some symptoms of the ﬂu, they should deﬁ-
nitely contact Student Health Services. The
vast majority, of people who get this will have
mild—to-moderate symptoms. Even moder-
ate ﬂu can wipe you out for a few days, but
it’s not necessarily dangerous. If people fall
into the high—risk groups and symptoms are
severe, they should contact their medical
provider.

TPN: What high-risk groups are we most

likely toﬁnd on a college campus?

Stebbins: Anyone who’s pregnant, anyone
with serious diseases like diabetes, severe
asthma, HIV or active cancer.

TPN: Are college students at a higher risk
for the complications of H1N1 than other

groups?

Stebbins: No, but a lot more kids and young
adults seem to be getting infected, which is
different from the regular ﬂu. People may
be feeling more anxious, but the risk is still

the same.

TPN: What do you think of the measures
being taken to prevent the spread of the
illness on campuses?

Skinner: If someone has this virus, they need
to be separated from other people. If they’re

- going to come into contact with people, they

need to be wearing a mask. Stay about 6 feet
away from infected people. That can go a long
way toward preventing the spread of this.

TPN: How is the virus most easily trans-
mitted?

Skinner: It’s primarily transmitted through
respiratory droplets. Usually, people cough
and other people acquire this through the re-
spiratory droplets of the sick person. You can
also pick it up through surfaces — doorknobs
and such — but the primary transmission is
respiratory droplets. The key is getting sick
people away from healthy people.

TPN: Once you’ve recovered from swine
ﬂu, are you immune?

Stebbins: It’s very likely that once you’re
done being infected, you’re immune —— even
if it’s a mild case. Maybe [immune people]
are the right people to help others who get
sick. That’s how they did it in the old days.
To my knowledge, you can’t give it back and
fourth to people between people who have
it.

TPN: How concerned should students be
about this?

Stebbins: Everybody drives on the road S

knowing it’s a little risky out there. We don’t
think about dying, even though it happens
to people. It’s kind of like that. There’s going
to he reports of people who get seriously ill
and die. When you get in your car, you wear

V your seatbelt and you have airbags.

TPN: Considering the risks of swine ﬂu are
similar to those of the normal inﬂuenza
virus, why are Pitt and other universities
reacting to this virus differently?

Stebbins: I think people are trying to ﬁnd
the right balance. We won’t know what that
is until we can look back and say this was
better than we expected or worse than we
expected.

TPN: What’s the biggest swine ﬂu miscon-
ception out there?

Stebbins: People feel that they have to make
a choice. Either they really worry about it or
decide that they shouldn’t pay any atten-
tion. I think the smart student ﬁnds a middle
ground where they’re not hugely worried,
but they’re paying attention and following
the recommendations.

Anarchy in

Giles Howard
Columnist

 

Tens of thousands of protesters are
planning to descend on Pittsburgh in
late September in order to oppose the
G-20 summit being held at the David
Lawrence Convention Center. Environ-
mental groups, human rights organi-
zations and advocates for the poor all
plan on protesting the G-20 Summit
and, although I disagree with many
of them, I fully support their right to
nonviolently express their opinions
in public.

That being said, a small minority
of protesters promises to physically
disrupt the G-20 through illegal means.
Organizingon the Internet,this minor-
ity has released countless statements
denouncing capitalism as a brutal
economic system responsible for the
world’s ills.

One such group, the Pittsburgh
G-20 Resistance Project, callsthe G-20
“the managers of our oppression” and
is calling on people to “confront and
disrupt the G-20 and its political,
corporate and institutional enablers
throughout the city” according to a
proclamation on its website.

Toward this end, the Resistance
Project is planning an unpermitted
march in violation of city ordinance
on Sept. 24. .

According to plans detailed on its
website, the march will involve un-
speciﬁed “direct actions,” a term that
has, at past international conferences
in London and Seattle, served as code
for violently disruptive protests and

vandalism by other groups.

Most notably, the anarchist Direct
Action Network planned protests
against the World Trade Organiza-
tion meeting in 1999 in Seattle that
included the vandalism of storefronts,
the smashing of windows and violent
confrontations with police.

The Resistance Project has even
postedalistoftargets forunpermitted
protests, including Starbucks, the Car-
negie Mellon Robotics Institute and the
Oakland Planning and Development
Corporation on Atwood Street.

The Resistance Project also issued
an online statement calling for sup-
porterswho cannot cometo Pittsburgh
to “plan local actions” and to “disrupt
schools and ﬁnancial institutions” as
a form of protest against the G-20
Summit.”

But this vague language is a clear
threat against educational institutions
around this country and their ability
to ﬁinction free ﬁom the interference
of extremists. What really piqued my
interestwas thataPitt student organi-
zation, Students forjustice in Palestine,

is listed on the site as havingendorsed _

the Pittsburgh G-20 Resistance Proj-
ect.

Wondering why a student organi-
zationwould supportthe disruption of
educational activities, I spoke tojonas
Moffat, the group’s president. During
our conversation, Motfatlisteda series
of grievances that, he said, justified
his organizations opposition to the
G-20 Summit. .

From President Obama’s escalation
ofthewarinAfghanistantothestateof
health care in the United States, Mof-

fat’s grievances had absolutely nothing
to do with the policies of the G-20 but
instead focused on the policies of the
United States as an individual nation.

Moﬁ'at’s sole criticism of the G-20
was that it had excluded Iran and
Venezuela from membership in the
group even though both states pos-
sessed large international economies.
Our conversation became more con-
ﬁontational when I asked Moffat ifhe
believed that Iran, as a state sponsor
of terrorism, and Venezuela, as a so-
cialist state opposed to international
capitalism, should be allowed into an
international body designed to pro-
mote economic cooperation.

to answer the questions because the

members of Students forjustice in Pal— p

estine have many conﬂicting opinions
andhe didn’tthinkitwouldbe rightto
give an opinion on behalfof his group
or inject his own opinion. Moffat did
say, however, that his group’s leaders
and more active members voted on
whetherto endorse the proclamation,
and the decision was unanimous.

I respect individuals who defend
their convictions reasonably and fac-
tually, but for the leader of a student
organization to defend his group’s ac-
tions through innuendo and sugges-
tions is simply irresponsible. Moffat

vide a yes-or—no answer as to whether cation for this is that the G-20 hasn’t

the United States is an international
sponsor of terrorism, Moffat said that
my questioningwas too aggressive and
ended the interview. ’

In a later interview with The Pitt
News, Moffat said that he declined

allowed Venezuela and Iran, two na-
tions ruledby dictators, to participate
in the Summit.

This is ridiculous, and what’s even
more disgusting is that every student
on campus is funding this group’s ac-

classroom

. tivities through the student activities

fee. According to Moffat, Students
forjustice in Palestine received about
$5,000 inﬁmdingfrom SGB last year
and he expects to receive even more
ﬁnancial support from the University
thisyear. '

Certainly, the student activities
fee is used to support a broad range
ofactivist organizationswith goals not
every student agrees with.

But_Students forjustice in Pales-
tine has called on students to disrupt
educational activities, and it is un-
conscionable that we should all be
monetarily supporting its existence
on campus. Academic funds should
not go to those who do not respect the
academic process andinsteadencour—
age its disruption. .

Indeed, Pitt’s “Guidelines for
Student Organization Certiﬁcation”
says that student organizations must
“refrain from advocating, inciting or
participating in any material interfer-

enceorphysicaldisruptionoftheUni- A

versity” and by calling on students to
“disrupt schools,” Students forjustice
inPa1estineis employinglanguage that
has led to such violations in the past.

It is inappropriate that such a
group be aﬂiliated with or supported
by this University, its administration
or student body. At minimum, this
organization’s certiﬁcation should be
suspended and their conduct reviewed
by the Student Organization Resourc
Center. '

Pittsburgh singer draws inspiration from everyday life

Natalie Bell
Staff Writer

Musician T.J. Cornwall is some-
thing of a case study for someone
who wants to follow his passion
in life.

He’s a mellow, indie-rocker
who’s been compared to John
Mayer, Gavin Degraw and Matt
Nathanson and is releasing his
album independently.

It’s quite a jump for someone
who started out in architectural
engineering at Penn State Uni-
versity.

“It took me a while to real-
ize that I wanted music to be my
entire life,” Cornwall said.

The Pittsburgh native earned
a bachelor’s degree in economics
from Penn State before he real-
ized that he wanted to spend his
days singing and songwriting.

“I don’t want to have a cor-
porate job,” Cornwall said in an
e-mail. “I don’t want to be like
everybody else, so I’m doing
something about it, and I love
my life right now.”

Despite growing up around
music, Cornwall didn’t really

hit his stride until later in life.
As a child, he’d feign illness to
skip out on piano lessons and
proclaims that as a junior high
school student, he was less than
listenable.

“I was absolutely horrible,” he
said. “I feel so bad for any of my
friends that had to listen to me
back then, but I practiced every
day and was so passionate about
the music I created even though it
probably wasn’t very good.”

All that practice eventually
led to songs streaming out on
the Internet during high school
and Cornwall being approached
by Garrett Bogden, a fellow Penn
State student interested in start-
ing a band.

Together, they started the
band Cloverleaf out of Pittsburgh
and Penn State.

Though Cornwall decided to
go solo, Bogden continues to
drum in his background band,
and they have maintained their
initial chemistry.

Withjohn Mayer as his biggest
influence, Cornwall tries to push
himself to continue developing
a sound and to branch out into
different genres.

“He alone makes me work
harder in‘ music,” Cornwall
said.

A lot of the music he listened
to as a kid in the ’90s —- like Nir-
vana, Counting Crows, Pearljam
and Ben Folds Five — affect his
music today. Feeling that music
is timeless, Cornwall aspires to

V have the same sort of effect with

his own work.

Cornwall describes this album
as pop-rock because of the catchy
choruses in his songs. V

He dabbles with several in-
struments, including the sounds
of acoustic guitar and piano,
which he plays himself.

However, he doesn’t, like to
conﬁne himself to being summed
up in just one sound.

Rather, he is open to exploring
new styles.

“I go through different phas-
es,” he said. “I think if a musician
keeps on making the same song
over and over again, he/she is set-
ting up limitations.”

Keeping that freshness means
that Cornwall has also grown in
lyric writing.

Generally, the people around
him are his inspiration for writ-

ing things.

However, he doesn’t just write
about love interests — he writes
about friends, enemies and even
intriguing strangers.

“I tell my friends not to piss
me off, because I won’t hesitate to
write a song about them,” Corn-
wall said. .

In the future, he would like

hoto Courtesy ofjshua Bakaitus

to move into writing about his
thoughts and opinions on life,
which he has already started to
do.

In the song “War and Peace,”
Cornwall discusses his feelings
on slavery, which he was inspired
to write after hearing lectures in
class on the issue.

Those feelings also propelled

Rapper uses ‘music to further global awareness

West African rapper Sona believes music should be about than just making money

Larissa Gula
Staﬁ Writer

Being heard is important to
anyone, especially to emerging
hip-hop artist Sona the Voice,
an independent rapper offering a
different message than the main-
stream media.

Born in Cameroon, West
Africa, Sona has spent his life
struggling to move forward and
shares a message about the status
of the world and its social and
political issues with anyone who
will listen.

“Some people are scared to

stand up,” Sona said. “I stand
apart and say, ‘Look, this thing
seems wrong. This thing seems
right. Why don’t we think about
it for a minute.”’ 

With the memories of growing
up in poverty inside a crowded
house in West Africa, Sona went
on to put the past to good use,
sharing his message with any
listener who has open ears.

“I write about things in my
past and also about some of
the social struggles around the
world,” Sona said. “There are a
lot of people in America who do
not get to see how some people
live around the world.

 

To me, good hip-hop
is the traditional
hip-hop that helps
uplift people.

Sona

While living in Africa, music
became his escape.

Sona described the imported
music from America and Europe
as “music for people who don’t
really have an outlet.”

Tupac was his favorite among
all the artists.

“He kind of gave me a way
out,” Sona said. “I would say
that was my connection. He was
an outlet in a country where you
cannot speak your mind.”

Sona’s opinion of hip-hop and
rap came from listening to music
such as Tupac’s, and his opinion
is set in stone.

“To me, good hip-hop is the

traditional hip-hop that helps
uplift people.” Sona said. “[Hip-

hop’s] not about people talking -

about how much money they have
or disrespecting someone else.
It’s not about talking about how
many women you can get. Good
hip-hop is not about bragging.
There are some social issues that
could be addressed by music and
helped by music compared to the
so—called hip-hop we have nowa-
days.”

Sona’s belief that music should
not always be about making mon-
ey was also on his mind when his
ﬁrst single became popular.

“I always try to not get in over

Kelsey recounts her harrowing Modest Mouse experience

Kelsey Shea
Assistant AérE Editor

 

The timing between an opening band walk-
ing off stage and the headliner marching
on is a delicate balance.

If there’s notenough time, a band sac-
riﬁces suspense and excitement, but, on
the other hand, in an overcrowded venue
in the heat of summer, what feels like a
minute to the band can feel like hours‘ to
the audience —— especially a lone little
Pittsburgher lost in a sea of unusually tall
people from Ohio. 4

‘Such was the case on my recent trip
to Columbus’s Lifestyle Pavilion to see
Modest Mouse.

After a solid opening set by a nice freak

folk band, I made my tragic mistake.

opened up before me, and I pressed on
with beer in my shoes and a song of hope
in my heart.

‘Five feet and 30 rude comments later,
another space in the crowd had cleared
around a single old man garbed in a leather
biker vest with matching pants, a bandana
around his head and aviators straight out
of the ’7os. V

I I was about to take advantage of the gap
to ‘move through the crowd when one of
the girls standing just‘ out of arms reach
from him grabbed my arm and told me that
I probably;,didn’t want to do that.

Without asking questions, I_found a
detour and moved on.

An odyssey full of drunks, crushed toes,
verbal abuse and a brief incident of sexual
harassment later, against all odds, I was

. reunited with my friends.

After another 15 minutes, I watched

An odyssey full of drinks, crushed toes, verbal
abuse and a brief incident of sexual harassment
later, against all odds, I was reunited with my

friends.

I left my comfortable and fairly close
standing spot to run off to purchase a
bottle of water at the bargain price of
$2.50.

I came back to somethingl can describe
only as terrifying.

In my ﬁve—minute absence, the number
of people in the already-crowded standing
space had doubled, leaving me to navigate,
worm and plead my way through an angry
labyrinth of dreaded Ohioans until I found
my friends.

After the initial panic, I dove in.

A bit of “please,” “thank you,” “sorry”
and “excuse me” got me about a grand
total of 10 feet into the crowd where I
met my ﬁrst foe.

A 3—foot circle had cleared around what
initially appeared to be an octopus having
a seizure but turned out to be a tall white
guy with dreadlocks thrashing along to the
Bonjovi song playing over the speakers.

’ A quick pelvis thrust and a ﬂying elbow
from the dreadlocked ﬁend knocked an in-
nocent bystander’s beer directly on me.

But, in an instant, a narrow path

(or rather heard — see aforementioned
unusually tall crowd) Modest Mouse put
on a great show worth driving four hours
to see.

But, that 40-minute gap in the show
left what started as a happy crowd hot,
impatient and agitated while waiting for
the headlining band.

So, my question is, where was Modest
Mouse through all of this?

Sure, there’s a distinct possibility the
band was setting up equipment or going
over the set. But, bands should be aware
of the conditions in which their audiences
are waiting.

If it’s hot and crowded and ﬁghts are
breaking out every loyminutes, it’s time

. to step in and give the people what they

want.

By the time Modest Mouse ﬁnally
came on, half the crowd’s enthusiasm
had smoldered into a sweaty, exhausted
irritation.

Shortening that 40-minute wait could
have doubled the energy of the concert and
made the experience 10 times better.

him to donate a portion of his proﬁts to
Kiva, an organization that provides aid
for entrepreneurs in developing countries
who are using loans from donators.

“It’s a phenomenal idea, and I feel like
I have a connection with them, because
they are doing the same thing as I am, but
I’m just lucky,” Cornwall said.

“That’s why I want to give back as much

i as possible.”

You can hear his music for yourself
if you go to the release party for his CD,

Stepping Stomar, which he will release inde-
pendently on Sept. 9 at the Smiling Moose
— upstairs (all ages).

The show starts -at 7 p.m., and doors
open at 6:30 p.m. with a $10 cover charge
that will also get you a CD.

Cornwall jumped headlong into his
dream, and he hopes that he can encour-
age his fans to do the same.

“Do what you want to do,” he said. “I’m
just like you. I had a dream and I wen
for it.” A 1’

good thing, and it felt good in the sense
that I was getting some good response
and people were getting the message. And
pretty much, that’s what I’m trying to ac-
complish. I’m trying to bring people into
the reality. I

So, what is his music about? Every-
thing.

“It’s not just social issues. It’s about
the music, too,” Sona said. “What I like to
say is that it’s not only about bling bling.
It’s not only about the money. It’s about

helping each other. It’s about helping your
neighbor and loving your neighbor.”

And, while all of his goals have not
been accomplished, he will continue to
produce music.

,“I’ll consider myself an alternative,”
Sona said. “Someone who is not going
to let people impose something to him. I
don’t let anyone stop me just because I’m
independent. It: means I make a sacriﬁce
to create a change.”

In the end, according to Sona, “All that
stuff kind of comes together and kind of
makes me the person I am.”

Volleyball finds successat home

The women’s volleyball team defeated Kent State 3-1 last night in its home opener

Randy Lieberman
Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s volleyball team
beat Kent State 3-1 in its home
opener last night to avoid a losing
streak heading into this weekend’s
Penn State tournament.

The Panthers (3-1) head into
this weekend’s matchup slated to
play Robert Morris, Buffalo and
No. 1-ranked Penn State. Penn
State leads the all-time series29—
19 and has won 12 matches in a row
against the Panthers. It will be the
ﬁrst time the Panthers will take on
the No. 1 team in the nation since
1990, when the Panthers fell to
UCLA 3-2.

Pitt won its home opener by

the scores of 25-18, 24-26, 25-221

and 25-21.

Sophomore Allyson Hodnik
paced the Panthers with a double-
double, notching 45 assists and 13
digs. Senior Meagan Dooley just
missed a double-double of her own
with 11 kills and nine blocks.

Junior Amy Town led the Pan-

thers with 20 kills, while senior
Melissa Stadelman recorded 12
kills and eight digs. Stadelman
paced the Panthers with a .450
hitting clip.

Senior Michelle Rossi led the
Panthers with 20 digs.Junior Mela-
nie Feldman also added 10 digs.

The Panthers out-blocked Kent
State 12.5-6.

After a 3-0 run by Kent State
made the score 23-20 for the Pan-
thersin the fourth game, Coach
Toby Rens called a timeout. The
Panthers closed out the game with
two kills from Dooley to take the
match.

The game was the Panthers Sea-
son Spike and featured free food
for a new student section. The
raucous crowd of 583 borrowed
many Oakland Zoo traditions to
use during the game.

Earlier this week, the Panthers
caught the attention of voters in

earned votes for its Top 25. ’

Despite a lack of hype, this year’s football team is stacked with players who could take it to a BCS Bowl game

It’s that time of the year again.
Summer is over, meaning classes
have started and the Pirates are
20 games out of ﬁrst place. Maybe
more importantly, college football
season is starting. .

For the Pitt football team, the

I season officially kicks off on Sat-

urday, as it takes (in Youngstown

Even though Pitt was picked to
win the Big East, the buzz around
this year’s team is lower than that
of last season’s, which was ranked
in the Preseason Top 25.But this
year’s team has the potential to go
further than last year’s and make

If that’s all true, then why all

the ’Burgh
for new
coach

Adam Littman
Assistant Sports Editor

It’s hard to tell what Frank-Cignetti
Jr. gets more excited talking about
— football or the city of Pitts-
burgh.

So it’s not exactly shocking that
he’s thrilled to be heading into his“
ﬁrst year as the football team’s of-
fensive coordinator and quarter-
backscoach. I

“It’sadream come true,” Cignetti
said.

Cignetti, a Pittsburgh native,
began his coaching career in 1989
as a graduate assistant at Pitt and
then spent eight years holding
various coaching positions at In-
diana University of Pemisylvania,
his alma mater. Since then Cignetti
has coabhed at North Carolina and“
Fresno State and also had stints in
the NFL coaching for Kansas City,
New Orleans and San Francisco.

Most recently he was the of-
fensive coordinator at California,
ateam that averaged 32.6 points per
game. But his time as a Golden Bear
lasted only one year, as he opted to
sign with the Panthers and make his
return to Pittsburgh.

“I’m coaching at the place that I

. love, in the city that I love,” Cignetti

said. “I’m living around family and?
friends. I’ve been blessed, profes-
sionally and personally, that I’m
doing what I want to do where I
want to do i ” .

His excitement hasn’t gone un-
noticed. s

“He is just like us — upbeat, fun,
and he wants to win,” junior run-
ning back Kevin Collier said.

“He’s always ready to go,” se-
nior wide receiver Cedric McGee
said. “He wakes up thinking about,
football, goes to sleep thinking
about football and wakes up in the
middle of the night thinking about
football. I love his enthusiasm and
excitement.”

Underclassmen provide hope for a possibly downplayed team
Oltmanns 4 11

  

Michael Heater | FOR THE NEWS

Quarterback Bill Stull passes the ball in a game against Louisville last November.

string player, he didn’t do much in camp to
solidify himself in that position. Redshirt
freshman Tino Sunseri looked sharp for
much of preseason practice and did enough
to pass Pat Bostick — who is probably going
to be redshirted —— on the depth chart and
put his name into the starting quarterback
discussion. ’

The coachessaid they want _to slowly
work Sunseri into game action. Wannstedt
said, “We want to get [Sunseri] into as many
games as we can.” A

But, if Stull continues to struggle, why
not just make the switch outright? It’s not
like Stull knows the offense that much bet-
ter than the younger quarterbacks now that
new offensive coordinator Frank Cignetti

1 has brought in a new system, and between

the two signal callers, Sunseri had the better
overall camp. Although there are two areas
of concern on offense, the team looks better
on defense.

The defensive line has at least three fu-
ture NFL draft picks. Ends Greg Romeus and
Jabaal Sheard should pick up right where
they left off and create havoc off the edge
on opposing offenses. Tackle Mick Williams
is also very tough to contain, and the ﬁrst
team offense saw a lot of him in the back-
ﬁeld. Brandon Lindsey earned himself the
primary backup defensive end position with
his strong play for the duration of camp.

That kind of depth can’t be understated as,
injuries are bound to happen over the course‘
of a full season.

Linebackers Adam Gunn, Max Gruder,
Greg Williams and Shane Murray will all get
plenty of reps. Williams is another NFL—cal—
iber player. And while Murray was a starter
in 2007 before he injured his knee, he will
come off the bench in games this season. This
speaks to the caliber of players that Pitt has
brought in since his injury.

In the secondary, cornerback and three-
year starter Aaron Berry has become a lock-
down corner while Dom DeCicco has looked
solid at strong safety. Elijah Fields and An-
drew Taglianetti will split time as the starting
free safety for now, as both have competed
hard all summer and deserve consideration
to be the ﬁill-time starter.

Time for my prediction for the season. I
have faith that one of the quarterbacks will
break through, and even if they don’t, the
team will be able to hang around in every
game it plays simply because the defense is
that good. I’m going to say the Panthers will
ﬁnish 9-3 this season, win the Big East and
go to a BCS bowl game for the ﬁrst time in
Wannstedt’s tenure at Pitt.

But, ﬁrst they have to beat Youngstown
State, as memories of Bowling Green still
linger in the minds of Panther fans every-
where.

Cignetti bringscreativity, unpredictability to plays

Cignetti 4 11

previous offensive coordinator who
left to be the quarterbacks coach
with the New Yorkjets.

“His packages are different [from
Cavanaugh’s],” Collier said. “He likes
to go downﬁeld more and he likes
to use the backs together, like play-
ing two running backs or two full-

backs at once. It’s different. It makes, ,

it more difficult for the defense to
pick up on what we’re doing.”

If Cignetti is set on playing multi-
ple running backs at once, he should
really have ﬁm with the Panthers.
Since LeSean McCoy left early for

"the NFL, Pitt doesn’t really have a

feature back. Freshman Dion Lewis
was named starter for the opening
week, but the Panthers are expected
to also use freshmen Ray Graham
and Chris Burns regularly. At full-
back, the Panthers can use Henry
Hynoski,]oe Capp and Collier, who
said he’s going to split his time be-
tween running back and fullback.
Cignetti said just running

through plays isn’t enough to pull ’

the offense together. What they re-
ally need is to go up against a defense

that is widely regarded as one of the
best in the Big East, as Pitt’s is.

“You better believe it helps [to
practice against the defense] ,” he
said. “It helps tremendously to
know that every time you step on
this practice ﬁeld you’re competing
against the best in the Big East.”

Still, Cignetti has numerous Pitt
fans towin overin hisﬁrstyear. One
of the most prevalent knocks on the
Panthers’ offense in recent years was
its predictability. McGee doesn’t see
that as a potential problem for the
upcoming year.

“We’re going to mix it up a lot
this year,” McGee said. “We’ve got
a little bit of everything.”

While his offense might not be
predictable, Cignetti might be. ‘If
there’s one thing you can accurately
guess about him it’s that he thinks
there is no better combination than
football and Pittsburgh.

“For me, it doesn’t get any better
thanworking at the Universityof
Pittsburgh, living in his great city
and working for a great head coach
like Dave Wannstedt,” he said.
