s the result of a lot of hard

work—'and a lot of gchool spirit.
It was impossible to organize a band in time t_o.play for .

the opening football game. At that time, it seemed improbable
that we'd have a band at all because so many of the former
members did notreturn to school. Band members who are in_
school did not want to take an inferior Pitt Band on to the
of the ﬁnereputationour Band

One game without a Pitt Band
was enough to convince them, and
other students, that ‘something must
be done. So they have reorganized
and are ready to make their ﬁrst
appearance today.

They will not be in uniform for
the Rally, but will don the Blue and
Gold for their debut .at the Stadium.

Registration ﬁgures released by
J. G. Quick, ‘University. Registrar,

tember 30, 1943,_is 19714. This ﬁg-

. ure includes enrollment in all of,
the schools exclusive of the grati-
uate school and afternoon, eve-
ning, and Saturday classes. Fresh-
men total 633, sophomores,.505,
juniors, 385, and seniors, 365. The
unclassiﬁed and special students
number -86. Students in the
Schools of Engineering and Mines
are registered on a quarterly
basis while the other schools still
have semester registration. Even
though these ﬁgures show a‘_.60%
decrease from last year’s enroll-
ment, last year’s totals represent
a decrease from previous years.‘

The Rally will have all the trim-
mings of those of former years.
There will be a Pitt band, albeit a
Pitt Band that was organized just
three days ago. And the_ fact that
there is a band is, in itself, a tribute
to» the general ﬁne school spirit, for
the forty boys who reported to Mr.
Theodore Finney, Head of the Music_
Department, were willing to put
up with battered -instruments, the
semi-freezing temperature of .the
basketball court practice room, and

together for‘ the Rally ‘today.

There will be cheerleaders, chair-
manned by Hugh Chavern, and the
traditional Pitt Panther will be
around to heckle the speakers and
the_ crowd.

Dr. Carlson, head speaker at the
Rally, urged everyone to attend.
“We are one of the fewA_rmy schools
in thepcountry who has given the
studentbody a team to cheer_abo_ut.
We have lost twoigames, both be-
cause we were outclassed, not be-
cause we wereioutfought. This is a
team worth cheering for. And-it’s
up to the student body to do it.”

The next Pep Assembly will be
held November 5 before "the Ohio
State game. Fourth hour classes
will be dismissed November 19 for
the ﬁnal Pep Rally of the season
which will precede. the Penn State
game: ' ‘

CPL. LARRY BOGART . . .1
relates war experiences-

\/.

Marines _on Februaryull, 1941. He
receivedi“boot training" at Parris
Island, andthen attended schools at
Quantico and Portsmuth‘, in Vir-
ginia. He wentijoverseas immedi-
ately after Pearl Harbor, was_
wounded October 26,1942, ‘and ar-
rived back in San Francisco on
January 28, 1943.

‘Discharged last August, he is now
a Freshman in the School of Busi-
ness Administration. “On board ship
you realize ‘how much life means to
you-—and you feel that if you get
back you want the best ,_,kind of life
you can get—-and education is a big
help.”

,.Of course, Bogart feels that there
is no outﬁt quite like the Marines,
-and if Uncle Sam would say .“O.
K.” he would be with the 155th mil-
lemeter battery battalion now sta-
tioned in New Caledonia. -

Since his return, Larry has been
appearing at many bond rallys to
urge civilians to give up 10 per
cent of their salaries for war bonds

about Pitt men in service. Today, however, we shall tell about
former University women who have responded to the call to

concentrated upon rehearsing‘ the
music this week, but they will have
some maneuvers ready for the next

, Mr. Finney will direct the Band,
and the following officers have been
elected: Paul Timko,' E, manager;
‘Alfonso Pontiere, C,’ assistant man-
ager; Eugene Durso, C, librarian;
George Wright, C, assistant libra-
rian; and Robert‘ Haden, ‘E, drum
major. William Sallbach, Feb. ’43,
and Robert Burford, E, will be in
charge of drilling.
‘ When complete, the Band will be
composed “of about 50 pieces. All
themembers will not march tomor-
row, however, because they do not
have instruments. Some of them did
not know that the Band would be
organized so quickly and ‘did not
bring their instruments from home.’
Other instruments are still in‘ stor-
age. _ V . ‘ .

“It has not been an easy job for
these boys to I organize and get
ready for today,” said Theodore W.
Biddle, Dean of Men, “but they,
were determined that if the student
wanted a Pitt Band, they should
have it.”" I

early is very rare; in fact, he’s in a
class by himself. I will try to be
late from now on. The prof asked
me a question and I didn’t know

the answer. (He old me to go back
to sleep.) Took a few minutes off
in the afternoon to pay my hospital-
ization dues at the Treasurer’s, Of-
ﬂee. Attended Custom’s Tea in the
Common’s Room. (Lovely fresh-
man girls.) There was a Pitt band
practice at the S_tadium; I didn’t
go; can’t play an instrument. ‘

Wednesday: . My roommate, re-
turned from class with the ﬁrm
opinion that his instructor smokes
opium. Chuck opened his slide rule
case all by himself today. Maybe
there is some hope for him. I am
quite happy for I have ﬁnally
grasped the meaning of everything
in my economics books up to,ibut
not including, the title page.
Thursday: Started to read a few
stories from a well known men’s
monthly (Esquire). ~Cou1dn’t con-
centrate. Started to look at the pic-
tures. Mrs. Starrett spoke at Fresh-
man Club on “Traditions at Pitt,”
and I learned a lot. In the afternoon,
ah sweet sleep! Terrible waste of
time, though. Sleep rudely inter-
rupted by thumping on ceiling. Ran
upstairs only to ﬁnd a sophomore
beating a freshman’s head against
the ﬂoor. Of course I wanted to get
my ideas in too, so I advised beat-
ing the freshman’§ head against the

to cause concussions. When I got
back to my room, I casually noticed
the body of the freshman falling
past the window. Lantern Night.
Lovely ceremony. Flames, an_d
torches, and women.

Friday: Gee, that’s today. Noth-
ing has happened yet. Someone
mentioned that there is a pep rally
today somewhere. Guess I'll go. See
ya there. . . . - » .

“Go west, young man, go west.”

And that is just what William
Hammaker did. Former Executive
(Secretary of the Pitt YMCA, Mr.
Hammaker left Pitt for the west
coastthis fall to acceptla position

Back east for a few days on a
business trip, and stopping in Pitts-

turn to Phoenix, Arizona with him,
Mr. Hammaker took time out for
a visit with his Pitt student friends.
He toldvthem, “I like the western

Panthers Seek First Win Tomorro

 Kahnorarions  
    of Sport

by rrarne nahn

 

J

You can really pity the Panthers this week for the pres-
sure is on. ‘Notre Dame? Great Lakes? In the purely intel-
lectual contemplation of the thing they were nothing. A touch-
down in either case would have constituted a moral victory.
_ A win was so -far from the general imagination that a Senate
I  ‘investigation might have been in order had any such event oc-
 » curred. For Notre'Dame_was in fact “too big, too oldand too
" gs; experienced.” Justin case there is any doubt of that you
it might look up that 55-13 shallacking they handed Georgia
, ..Te,ch’s Navy laden team lastweek. Great Lakes was more of
the same.

, But West Virginia is neither “too big, too old, nor too ex-
perienced.” They are, in a word,»just right. And so for. the
wet time, the 1943 Panthers must prove themselves. For
there can be no excuses this week. They must show that the
gameness and ﬁght they displayed against Notre_Dame and
Great Lakes were not “mere heroics, but a preview of what
would happen when they broke into their own league. '

   
  
  
 
   
  
  
  
   
   
   
  
  
   
   
  
   
   
  
   
  
  

. . Last Saturday’s game indicated some improvement in
 the Pitt defense and attack. But their passing, which is a good
:7 _ 90% of the “T” formation, has been woefully weak. The sad

" ‘statistics show that the Panthers completed but one of the 13'
passes attempted in the Notre Dame game and completed none
at all in the game with the Sailors. I ‘

_ ' "But even worse than the pass incompletions and inter-
. oeptions have been tliemechanical deﬁciences. Some seven‘
 ffumbles wer chalked up against_ the Pitt in the Great Lakes-
 ‘game and three of those contributed materially to that 40.0
7‘-"‘. score. Subtract those -three gift tduchdowns and you have a
respectable if not satisfactory 19-0 score, and the Panthers
 all‘ admit that “Great Lakes was better but not 40 points
%better.” ‘A A '*
I , Wartime football is such that you neverknow today just
who will be in your lineup tomorrow. Fate seems to have
singled out the Panthers for a unique lease-lend arrangement
‘with Uncle Sam. That is to say, they lend us one player and
lease another—for theduration. Thus, the Panthers had some
, jreason to rejoice the day halfback Frank Knisley received
""v"Ahis Navy V-12 papers which would permit him to remain in
 school. But they had no sooner ﬁnished-congratulating‘them-
(selves when Angelo Carlaccini was called up by,’ the Army.

/

» On Monday, Jim Reber, who has been gone since the ﬁrst
“of September, reported back from, Pennsylvania where he
 “went through his “boot”‘ training. But on Tuesday Marty
Rosepink announced his very eminent entrance into the Navy.

V In any event, Pitt should not have too much trouble with,
; the Men -from the Mountains tomorrow. Certainly, after the

‘ ttke dummy scrimmage. _For as Chet Smith so aptly put it,
' : _._, When you ve been hitwith a steam roller, a man on a bicycle
=»isn’t much of a menace.”

V A great deal _is_ at stake for the Panthers Saturday’. For
‘what they do can either make or break theirseason. The line‘
a from the Pitt Victory song will never beso apt as it will be
 flomorrow for, verily, “Pitt MUST Win Today.”

been hospitalized since then. It is ex-

season. Chelko aggravated an old
arm injury in the game‘ and as a re-
sult has been wearing his arm in
a sling. It is doubtful -whether he
will be able to see action Saturday.

The Panther football chances re-
ceived another blow this week when
Tackle, Marty Rosepink who cap-
tained the Panthers in the game
with Great Lakes, announced that
he was leaving- for the Navy next
Tuesday. Rosqepinklhad been classi-
ﬁed 4F because of a punctured ear

drum. However,‘ he recently re- 7

ceived notice that he was to report
for an examination to be reclassi-
ﬁed. He is now. in the Naval Reserve
and, ironically enough, will, in all ,
probability be sent to Great Lakes
for “boot" training. ~ '

There have been some changes in
the Panther lineup since the Notre
Dame contest. Joe Pierre and Jim
Maloney will‘ again team up -as
Ends. At tackle will be Milt Ebert
and Marty Rosepink -who will play
his last game as a Panther. Suc-
ceeding Rosepink on the ﬁrst var-
sity will be either Bill Galand or
Leonard West. West is the. brother
of Walter who was ﬁrst string quar-
terback last year and Pat who play-
ed halfbackfon the Bowser squad.

Hammond will replace Don Fish-_
er‘ at center. At guardi.wil1 be Fran-
cis" Mattioli, :who ‘played a ‘consist-1
ently good game against both Notre

halfback and Tom ‘Kalmanir will
