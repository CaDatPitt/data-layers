WPTS seeks underwriters
to avoid cuts in programming

' By Richard Tourtellott

Staff Writer

Imagine radio commercials with-
out hyperbole or price quotes. How
can you sell a product if you can’t
claim that it's the best‘ or that the
price is lowest? Getting an advertiser
to submit to this kind of handicap is
like asking the owner of a

vthroughbred if he has a job for a

300-lb. jockey.

Pitt’s radio station, WPTS-FM,
has exactly that problem. The sta-
tion is licensed as a non-profit
broadcaster. Therefore, the Federal
Communications Commission
allows underwriting on the station
but forbids advertising. And unless
WPTS finds more underwriters,
future programming could be se-
verely limited.

The difference between under-
writing and advertising, according
to Bill‘ Boring, marketing director
for WPTS, is that underwriting res-
tricts the content of a commercial
message.

“The key statement is that the
message can’t involve a value judge-
ment,” Boring said. “We’re not
allowed to give prices, either, but we
can use their jingles.” he added. Bor-
ing was quick to point out, however,
that underwriting is not charity.

Underwriting programming on’

WPTS has been an effective‘ and
inexpensive way for some businesses
to get their name known, according
to Boring.

“Most seem to be pleased,” he
said. “Some call us and say they
heard their announcement and liked
it. One of the major benefits to them
is that since we are non-profit,
underwriting costs are tax deducti-
ble, every cent."

The messages tend to be short.
The less expensive ones are only five
to seven seconds in length. The more
costly messages are. about 15
seconds long.

“The FCC doesn’t restrict time.
We put that restriction on,” Boring
said.

“We have a group of about 18
consistent underwriters, most of
them being local businesses. Now we
want to get the corporate sponsors.

‘ “It's difficult to develop consistent

underwriting,” he continued. “We
can’t pay for a sales staff, so it’s hard
to get people to sell underwriting.”

The station’s general manager,
Wilfred Tremblay, claims that he is
not too concerned with the lack of
underwriters. “We just started our
marketing department in January,”
Tremblay said. “We anticipated that
our first year would not be that
successful.” V

According to Tremblay, under-
writing will not decide whether
Wi-T3 ".tays on the air. Underwrit-
ing, Trembley claims, provides only
“discretionary income.”

“We’re not in any financial diffi-
culty; it’s just that if we had more
underwriting, we could do more,” he
said.

Vice President of Student Affairs
‘Conney Kimbo said he agreed with
Tremblay’s assessment.

“We will have a radio station
whether we have underwriting or
not,” Kimbo said. However, Kimbo
pointed out that a lack of underwri-
ters would hinder the station’s abil-
ity to present certain types" of
programs.

Andy Smith, director of student

activities, elaborated on what
WPTS could lose without
underwriting.

'“We’re not sure that we can cover
women’s basketball or have live cov-
erage of news events and "other activ-
ities unless the cost of that type of
programming is funded by under-
writing,” Smith said.

According to Smith, underwriting
pays for the use of telephone lines
during a live broadcast. “When we
broadcast sports and special events,
it’s the underwriting that pays for
it.”

The -problem of procuring the
funds that separate lackluster col-
lege radio stations from those sta-
tions with professional capabilities
has put Boring in a -difficult
situation. ,

“It’s hard because we’re fighting
the university, too,” Boring
lamented. “For example, we’ve been
trying to get a design for a logo
approved. We‘ won’t get it until at
least 1986. It has to be approved by
everyone.” '

According to Boring, the inertia
imposed by the university structure

and the lack of underwriters can't
hide the fact that the station is other-
wise quite healthy.

“It took us about 10 years to get
an FM license, and now we have
more wattage and a whole lot more
listeners on FM,” he said.

Boring also said that not all of the
station’s listeners are university stu-
dents. Through marketing studies,
Boring found that during
summer months the station’s ratings
did n’t fall, indicating that the station

Budget approved

Tuition increases expected

By Dirk Kaufman
Editor in chief

The board of trustees has
approved a $420.5 million budget
for the 1985-86 school year. The
budget includes tuition increases of
anywhere from 9.1 to 26.3 percent.
This will be the eleventh consecutive
year tuition has increased. Univer-
sity officials said, the increase was
due to lower state appropriation
than needed and a one-time invest-
ment in computer systems for
students. .

According to President Wesley
Posvar, “The increase in our appro-
priation is considerably less than we
requested, but with careful balanc-
ing of institutional needs and priori-

ties, with prudent management this '

budget will allow us to sustain and
improve the quality of our academic
programs, even though increases in
tuition are higher than anyone
would like.”

Tuition rates for in-state under-
graduates in the arts, sciences and
general studies will go up $240 (or
9.1. percent) to.$2,890. At.the other
extreme, in-state pharmacy students
will have their tuition raised 26.3
percent from $3,350 to $4,230. Out-

of-state students will face the same"

increases, with the exception of
those in the School of Medicine.
Graduate students will face
increases anywhere from 10.7 to 13.2
percent. The lower of the two will
occur in the schools of arts and
interna-
tional and public affairs. Highest
graduate school tuition increases

will be absorbed by the engineering
school. Law school tuition will
increase 17.6 percent, and dental
school will go up 11.1 percent.

The medical school tuition rates
increase with each year‘ of
study. First-year students receive a
9.9-percent increase, those in their
second year a 14.7-percent increase,
and third-year students a 20.8-
percent increase. Fourth-year stu-
dents will receive an 18.2-percent
increase.

Out-of-state medical school stu-
dents will receive a 10.1-percent
increase for the first year, and 13.4-,
l6.9- and 1 17.8-percent increases for
each subsequent year.

The university originally
requested $103 million in state fund-
ing but received $94.6 million. The
appropriation is a $4.9 million
increase over last year’s budget. The
university will also receive a special
allocation of $1.1 million-from the
state to be used for the purchase of
instructional equipment. -

The. rates also include a $100

_increase per student to help finance

academic computing systems. The
money will be used to acquire and
update systems designed to provide
students with access to advanced
computing and word-processing
capabilities in the immediate future,
according to officials.

The budget also includes ,a.six-
percent increase in funds allocated
for faculty and staff salaries over the
last year. Officials said that increases
will be determined for each
employee individually, and there
will be no across-the-board salary
hikes. ’

Recent stock purchase violates
the universi y's divestment policy

At a meeting of the Board of Trus-
tees last week, Chuck Pascal, chair-
man of the Pitt Divestment Cam-
paign, submitted a document which

revealed a university investment in a’

company not in compliance with the
_Sullivan Principles. ' _

t The document said that Owens-
Illinois lnc., which the university has

‘ purchased 5,700 shares of stock in,

has not and does not intend to sign
the Sullivan Principles, a set of
employment guidelines for compan-
ies which do business in South
Africa.

The statement said that while the

Pitt Divestment Campaign will

assume that an honest mistake had

been made, the organization is
“troubled and angered that such a
purchase could be made without the
knowledge that Owens-Illinois has

‘long invested in South Africa.”

Pascal requested in the statement
that the university act on the follow-
ing: a review of investment proce-
dure, a _reprimand of‘ those
responsible for the purchase of the
Owens-Illinois *stock,. letters from
President Posvar to the corporation
informing them of the reasons Pitt
sold its stock, a monitoring commit-

tee of faculty, students and adminis-
trators to monitor future
investments independently, renewed
consideration of total divestment,
and immediate sale of Owens-
Illinois stock.

The statement said that all of the
requests were reasonable, since the
university had mismanaged its
investment policy by purchasing the
Owens-llli_nois stock.

The board recognized the submis-
sion of the statement by the Pitt Di-
vestment Campaign and assured
further consideration of
statement. -

A 14-inch water main on Her-
ron Hill burst yesterday after-
noon, leaving University of
Pittsburgh buildings north of
Fifth Avenue without water.

According to Gordon Bugby,
the associate director of engi-

  Local water main

neering and planning for the uni-
versity, workmen had to drain
Herron Hill reservoir in order to
fix the leak. Bugby said that
draining the reservoir was the
reason why water was seen in
some Oakland streets.

Bugby said that all of the uni-
versity's plumbers were notified
to be on thejob when the leak is
finally repaired. The plumbers
will divert each affected build-
ing’s water into the sewer until

breaks  

the water regains its clarity.

“Our main concern is to avoid
dirty water in the system,” Bugby
said. Particles from the inside of
the pipes break loose when this
happens.

Water in toilet bowels might
show discoloration for a day or
so. Also, drinking water might
have a rusty taste, according to
Bugby.

Peace network challenges military spending report

By Nadia Moritz

Features Editor

In March, the Pitt Graduate
School of Public and International
Affairs prepared a report for the
city, analyzing the impact of military
spending in Pittsburgh and conclud-
ing that the city benefits —from Pen-
tagon spending. _In April and
through a series ofpublic hearings in
June, the report was assailed by
local pacifist groups. Five months
after the release of the report, the
struggle over its validity still
continues.

The GSPIA report calculates the
impact of military spending in Pitts-
burgh for fiscal year 1983 and con-
cludes that Pentagon spending
generated $l08 million more for the
local economy than residents paid in
defense taxes in 1983.

Mandated by Section 204 of the
city charter, which was voter-

' approved in l982 despite a mayoral

veto, the report calculates military

'_ spending for two categories: con-

tracts given to businesses with'Pitts—
burgh performance sites and
veterans’ affairs (veterans’ hospitals
and benefits to city residents). Using
generally accepted definitions of
military spending, the report esti-
mated that city residents contribute
$341.8 million to national military
spending while the city‘s gains
amounted to $449 million. The

' report also estimated that more than

7,500 jobs in Pittsburgh were
created by military-related contracts

to local firms.

Last year's report, prepared by the
city finance department, claimed
that the city received $460 million
more in military spending than resi-
dents paid in defense-related taxes in
1982, but the report has since been
acknowledged by administration
officials as inaccurate.

Although members of the peace

“As citizens, we have little to say about the

Pentagon Budget.

The local legislative

attempts are attempts of citizens to say ‘Hey
we can talk about this. ‘ ”

—Robert Norman

Associate Professor of GSPIA

coalition have accepted the current
report as an improvement upon the
previous one, they claim that it still
leaves many questions unanswered
and even contains “significant
ﬂaws,” according to Robert Nor-
man, associate professor at GSPIA.

One of the ﬂaws, according to
Norman, is that the total value of
defense contracts with city-based
firms such as Westinghouse were

‘ erroneously counted.

“Eighty percent of the city‘s
defense contracts, according to that
study, go to Westinghouse,” said
Norman. “There are no Westing-
house production facilities in Pitts-
burgh. Everyone knows that money
is not spent in Pittsburgh. The check
may be mailed downtown, but that
doesn’t mean it generates income.”

In 1982, for example, .Westing-
house defense contracts totalled
$558.1 million, but Westinghouse
Defense Group public relations
manager Tom Duncan told The Pitt
News in February that 99 percentof
the company's defense business was
in Baltimore.

Marion Anderson, of Employ-
ment Research Associates of Lans-
ing, Mich., and author of_ several
reports on military spending, ques-
tioned the number ofjobs estimated
in the report,,deeming it as “simply
wrong." She said that increases in
the Pentagon budget have elimi-
nated jobs in the civilian economy,
hitting industrial areas such as Pitts-

burgh the hardest. Every $1 billion
spend on defense results in a net loss
of 12,000 jobs nationwide.

“We are closing our cities to
finance the military," said
Anderson.

According to Anthony Cahill, one
of the four GSPIA professors who
prepared the report, analyzing the
relationship between defense con-
tracts and jobs in Pittsburgh is not
quite so simple.

“Take Westinghouse, for exam-
ple. It’s very clear that not all of the
money coming into Westinghouse
stays in the city," he said. “But the
only way to get that information is
to go into the company. That infor-
mation is not available to anyone
including ourselves.”

According to Cahill, the difficulty
in analyzing defense contracts is
determining an appropriate decision
rule to consider contracts as in or
out of Pittsburgh.

“We only dealt with prime con-
tracts in this report,” said Cahill.
“Other companies have secondary
defense contracts from outside com-
panies not counted in the report.
Who is to say if one would balance
out the other?”

Although the authors of the Pitt

study have no intentions of revising
their report this year, Cahill said
that for next year's report the group
intends to figure out a decision rule

that would make the estimates more
accurate.

“Estimations are a problem
because there is little available statis-
tics on the city, even for tax informa-
tion," Cahill said. “Statistics are
gathered on a macro level, which
means ‘we must start estimating.

“We can't predict a change,” he
continued. “But we will be more
confident in our prediction."

Cahill hopes that the effects ofthis
problem will be lessened with a new
decision rule.

Also, in next year’s report, Cahill ,

said that the groups would like to
add a moral perspective to the
report.

“Whether [or not] military‘spend-
ing is a moral use of funds was not
the purpose of the report,” he said.
“The peace groups wanted us to
tackle this issue and we didn’t. That
would have been mixing oranges

‘and apples.”

On the other hand, Jobs with
Peace, one group opposing the

JULY 17,1985

report, believes that the report
should make citizens aware of the
negative effects of increased defense
spending.

“There is a need to have citizens’
participation in the report,” said
Norman, who is a representative of
Jobs with Peace. “As citizens, we
have little to say about the Pentagon
budget. The local legislative
attempts are attempts of citizens to
say, ‘Hey, we can talk about this.’
We think it’s some of the most

1 important legislation in the city.“

According to Joe Hughs, another
representative of Jobs with Peace.
the group has been trying to contact
the mayor through letters and phone
calls to discuss the prospects of a
citizens’ committee participating in
the formulation of the report.

“We want to meet with the mayor
to discuss the development of a cross
section of public representatives on
the report committee,” said,Hughs.
“Nothing has developed and we are
growing impatient.”

has an audience that goes beyond
the dorms and apartments of
Oakland. '

“We get 2,000 to 3,000 calls in a
monthly period," Boring claimed.
He estimated that between eight to
10 percent of the listeners call in to
request music or express opinions.

"I took my statistics to an adver-
tising agency, and they estimate our
audience at 4,000 people per average
quarter hour,” Boring said. Accord-
ing to the marketing study, the larg-
est audience for WPTS is during the
hours of 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.

The marketing survey shows that
most listeners are between 18 and 30

years of age. They live, for the most
part, in Oakland and the eastern
suburbs.

When atmospheric conditions
allow it, the station’s signal can be
picked up outside the city’s environs.
“Some calls are from so far away,
we’re surprised,” Boring said.

Boring claims that even though
the audience is loyal, the lack of
underwriters portends an uncertain
future for the station. However, he
admitted that the station’s demise is
unlikely. “What’s more likely,” he
said, “is that we could wind up with a
pre-programmed format and a lot
more university control.”

Male fear and fantasy revealed »

in discussion for ‘women only’

1'‘

By Susan Benedek
Staff Writer

Sex and intercourse are not
equatable, and men and women
should realize this “myth" before it
becomes detrimental to their rela-
tionship, according to Marty Klein,
a California marriage counselor and
sex therapist who spoke at the Cen-

‘fer for Human Development on July
15. In a lecture entitled “Male Sexu-
ality: For Women Only," Klein dis-
cussed male fears and fantasies and
patterns in relationships.

“Intercourse is one kind of sexual
experience. Sex is not a one minute
event but begins with the blushing

you get when you first meet,” said.

Klein at the lecture. “Males often
perpetuate this myth because it has
been imbedded in them and taught

“By the time a man reaches 16 or
I7, he tries to prove his masculinity
through sexual accomplishments.
On the surface he may express a
great deal of braggadocio, yet inside
he is insecure because he is not get-
ting the proper information about
sex.”

According to Klein, males at that
age often engage in sex less for inti-
mate pleasure than for a “sense of
accomplishment.” They then “pre-
tend to know” what sex is all about.
Meanwhile, their peers are also
pretending.

“Unfortunately," he continued,
“this misinformation often con-
tinues into adulthood, and another
male myth is perpetuated in which
the male is supposed to know
everything.

“There is a tremendous "push, usu-
ally beginning in early adulthood,

“By the time a man reaches 16 or I 7, he tries
to prove his masculinity through sexual

accomplishments. On the surface he may do
a great deal of braggadocio, yet inside he is

“Bette Midler once said that being
a woman was like being a waitress at
the banquet of life,” he continued.
“Well, it’sjust the same way for men
—— they experience the pressures and
the joys just as females, only
differently.”

,9 According to Klein, understand-
ing the male experience might
enhance women‘s knowledge about
why a man acts the way he does.

“The worst thing that can happen
to an ll-year-old boy is to be called a
‘sissy,’ ” Klein said. “That kid will
feel as if he has to re-certify himself
and his masculinity every day. It’s a
real oppressive situation that may
often carry over into adolescence
and adulthood. It’s a continual
attempt trying to live up to being a
man.

development that this is ‘masculine.’

where the male wants to feel ade-
quate and accomplished. Yet, many
men at this time don’t know up from
down.”

Klein also stated that men often
assume that they must make a
woman have an orgasm because
only then are they “real men.”

“I’ve seen men drag women into
my office and tell me to ‘fix her’
because she doesn’t have an orgasm
when they make love,” he said. “Yet,
the Hite report has shown that more
than half the women interviewed
didn’t have an orgasm during inter-
course. This is a real adequacy trip
for a male."

The male “ethic of accomplish-
ment and adequacy" is often asso-
ciated with a man’s and a woman’s
misperception that his genital organ
is the main actor.

“A man rarely sees another man’s
erection,” Klein stated. “A view of
another man’s penis happens only in

the bathroom, and given the angle of
vision, things often appear bigger
and therefore supposedly better.
Freud had it all wrong - it‘s not the

female that has penis envy, it's the

male.” V
Addressing a question from the
audience on sexual harassment,

‘ Klein replied, “Men are not trained

to regard women as equals, but
rather nurturers and inferiors. This
is obviously not nice.

“Men do not know what to do
with female colleagues. With a male
co-worker, he hits him in the arm or
ribs him. I believe that men harm
women because fundamentally they
want human contact. Also power
plays a role. This is not an excuse. I
think it is imperative that a woman
in such a situation educate the man
on ‘boundaries’ — the physical and
psychological ones. Men rarely have
a concept of boundaries.”

Concerning relationships, Klein
stated that it was important to be
honest. It is important to lay out the
rules — whether in the situation ofa
one—night stand or in a marraige —
so that both parties understand and
take responsibility for their actions.

“You should not negotiate on
things that are important to you,”
Klein explained. “This does not
mean you shouldn’t compromise.
There should be no need for some-
one to say ‘no’_four times. Obviously
this is a risk to the relationship, but
you must _set up boundaries and
expect them to be respected. Then it
is important to carry that one step
further by discussing why such a
thing matters to you.”

According to Klein, the concept
of romance may be harmful to a last-
ing relationship: “Rbmance is a con-
cept that the woman is helpless and
the male should take care of her. In a
romance,
female forget they are playing, and
ultimately‘ the relationship becomes
unbalanced. You can't have good
sex in an unequal relationship where
the man is responsible for a woman's
orgasm. I

“In relationships we have been
taught that honesty is punishable,”
he continued. “If only a man would
tell his wife that he has been
attracted to_ Sally So-and-So next
door and ask what are ‘we’ going to
do about it. The issue is that some-
thing in the man is threatening the
relationship and then work it out
from "there together.”

Conference focuses on trauma
ofvictims following a disaster

By Kevin J. Krist
Staff Writer

The tornadoes that ravaged west-
ern Pennsylvania in late May are

sljust a memory to many, but for the

victims of that disaster, the suffering
continues. While most of their phys-
ical needs (food, shelter, medical
attention, etc.) have been provided,
the psychological impact of the
ordeal carries ramifications that will
be of major concern for some time.

This‘ is why local mental
health/ mental retardation adminis-
trators’ offices, in conjunction with
Pitt’s Office of Mental Health and
Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic, have just recently completed
a teleconference series to deal with
the problems that may arise. The
latest — “Mental Health Manage-
ment of High Risk Populations
During a Disaster: The Identified
Psychiatric Patient and the Elderly”
— occurred yesterday.
i The series, designed to supple-
ment the knowledge of workers and
volunteers who are currently provid-
ing care and support for the victims
and to take advantage of the teach-
ing facilities at the University of
Pittsburgh, consisted of four weekly
sessions and, through teleconferenc-
ing, provided discussion and consul-

u : - . o o . . . . L . . - . g - n a - p a ~ o . -

tation among nine different
locations, representing 13 counties.

While most people can handle the
stress that may be associated with
such disasters, there are certain
high-risk groups that may require
special attention, according to
Linda Frank-Hertweck from the
Office of Education and Regional
Programming at WPIC, which
sponsored the series.

One such group -— children -
have shown fear and anxiety in
situations reminiscent of their ear-
lier ordeal, such as thunderstorms.
Frank-Hertweck believes that edu-
cation is a key factor in alleviating
this stress and points out that while
educational programs are virtually
unknown in this part of the country,
they have proven effective in the
midwest and are planned for the
next school year in some of the
affected communities.

Other groups, which were once
believed to be high-risk, have shown
no significant change in mental
health and, in the case of the elderly,
have even proven to be a valuable
resource in a crisis situation. While
more prone to physical injury from
the disaster, the elderly, who have
already been through different crisis
situations in their lives and are less
affected by the loss of property, have
been shown to have a more positive
attitude in the aftermath of the dis-
aster than was expected.

. . . . u » . . - ~ . . . u . . - « . . » . — . . . . . .

One of the keys in treating any

mental health disorder that may’

arise besides education to give vic-
tims back their “sense of control” is
providing “outreach” services
instead of “traditional mental health
services,” according to Frank-
Hertweck. By avoiding psychiatric
labels -and providing human servi-
ces, mental health care workers
should be able to help victims focus
on strengths, thereby helping them
to keep the positive outlook ena-
bling them to overcome their
adversity.

These psychiatric labels are the
products of an extreme stereotypical
reaction to disaster that, according
to Frank-Hertweck, is propagated
by the media and in themselves can
prove to be expectation fulfillment.

Combatting such problems must
also be undertaken through region-
alized specialization. “These disas-
ters cause more than just property
damage," stated Frank-Hertweck.
“They interrupt the rhythm and net-
work of the community and social
life.” Therefore, each solution must
be geared to that specific
community.

In a related measure, the National
Institute of Mental Health is setting
up a crisis counseling program in
accordance with the Disaster Relief
Act of I974 in association with local
MH/MR Administrators to help
the victims of the May disaster.

Everyone wants to find a relation-
ship that works. We're all looking
for Mr. Right. The question is: Will
we know him when we see him?

In a seminar entitled “Relation-
ships: Making Good Choices," one
in a series being offered by the Cen-
ter for Human Development, Dr.
Ralph Brooks offered his views on
human attraction and outlined his
approach to finding and maintain-
ing a healthy relationship. '

Why are we attracted to certain
people? Why do we‘ get involved

,with these people instead of those

people? Where do I find the person
in the first ‘place? Dr. Brooks began
answering these questions by quot--
ing Socrates.

“Know thyself," he said. “It's
important for you to _understand
yourself before you can know how
much meaning a relationship can
have in your life. You have to know
what you‘re looking for before you
start looking.”

According to Brooks, contempor-
ary society has brainwashed its
members — particularly its female
members — into believing that find-
ing,and establishing a romantic rela-
tionship with the right person is not
just a nice part of life but a basic
prerequisite to even being a person.
IfI don’t find someone, my life is a
waste.

“Know yourself, its important for you to
understand yourself before you can know
how much meaning a relationship can have

in your life. ”

-—Dr. Ralph Brooks;

Human Development Center

‘‘It’s like that commercial for
mufflers," Brooks explained, “the
one where a man drives into a cheap
repair shop and asks if they have a
muffler to fit his old foreign car.
‘Don’t worry,’ the repairman says,
‘We’ll make it fit.’ Iffinding the right
person becomes too important, if
you are too desperate, then all that a
person has to do is be able to breathe
and walk, and you’ll make it fit.”

In his book entitled “The Denial
of Death," Ernest Becker addresses
the source of this societal pressure
that Brooks sees as the source of our
desperate need for romance.

Three questions whose answers
were at one time sought through reli-
gion —— Who am I‘? What is the pur-
pose of life? How do I measure up in
life? — are now sought through a

pargicular American fascination

that Becker‘ refers to as “The
Romantic Solution._”I am who I‘m
with. The purpose of my life is to
find that special person. And my
worth as an individual depends on
whether or not I find_that person.

“We become invested in a part of
life as it is the point of life,” Brooks
said. “The emptiness can become
unbearable, until we are willing to

make any choice, no matter how ri-'

diculous, in order to fill the empty
slot in our lives." .
This leads to a phenomenon that
Brooks calls the “Rescue Fantasy,"
the conviction that there is someone
out there somewhere who is so right
for me, that when I finally find him,
all‘will be well.
“Some people want to be
rescued," he continued, “but others
want to be the rescuer, like the man
willing to marry the woman who is
pregnant with another man's baby.
His gallant offering of himself is
really a way of protecting himself.
He doesn’t have to worry about
being abandoned because he can
spend the rest of his married life
knowing that “you owe me.’ Sim-
ilarly, ‘The Florence Nightingale
Syndrome’ draws a woman to a man
with glaring character defects. She

can be sure that everyone, including

his mother, will be greatful to her for
her’ efforts. Either way, the rescuer
establishes moral leverage for him or
herself. People who want to be the
rescuer are really only finding a
clever’ way to get rescued
themselves.”

Brooks explained that the way we
see ourselves can depend a great deal
upon the way society sees us. Socie-
tal stereotypes distort our percep-
tions of ourselves and inﬂate our
expectations of others.

“Society sees a woman looking for
endless romance," he said. “She is
swept off her feet by the man who
shows up at her door at three o’clock
in the morning holding a single red
rose. Unfortunately, the fantasy
ends with the courtship, and the
woman’s subsequent disillusion-
ment could destroy the relationship
for her.”

The stereotypical male is only
‘after one thing: sex. ,

“Today," Brooks continued,
“men have seen too many Liberty
Avenue movies. A man can get
really angry when his girlfriend
doesn't live up to his masturbatory
fantasies. If there is any crazy distor-
tion, it’s a man’s reaction to a sexu-
ally arousing female. He assumes
that if she excites him that much, she
must be exciting. This kind of pro-

jection can really set the guy up for
anger and disillusionment. ‘You
could but you won’t,’ he thinks, as
his fantasy crumbles."

Pittdeans testify at conference
reviewing, Higher Education Act

By Joe Krzywiecki
Staff Writer

At a congressional subcommittee
hearing last Friday, Representative
Joseph Gaydos discussed the prob-
lems and situations concerning
financial aid and secondary educa-
tion. Gaydos, who represents the
20th congressional district, visited
the McKeesport campus of Penn
State with Representative William
Ford of Michigan to gather testimo-
ny of different perspectives and edu-
cational institutions for the House

Subcommittee on Education.

Twelve educators and experts of
four panels, including Dr. Elizabeth
Baranger, associate provost and
dean of graduate education at Pitt,
Dr. Burkart Holzner, director of
Pitt’s Center for International Stu-
dies, and Dr. Robert Comfort, asso-
ciate dean of Pitt’s College of
General Studies, gave testimony
about the current and future needs
of higher education.

Among the people testifying were
State Representative Ronald
Cowell, chairman ofthe subcommit-
tee of education in Pennsylvania.
Cowell said that there is a “Cry for
stability for federal student aid.”
Cowell went on to say that college is

too expensive for some students to ‘

even think about attending and that
there is some confusion about apply-
ing for Pell grants and loans because
people assume that the proposed
cuts they hearabout on TV and
radio have already taken effect,
when in most cases no cutbacks in
aid were in effect.

To eliminate that confusion,
Cowell proposed a “collaborative
effort between. state and federal
governments so that we canicoordi-
nate our activities better.” Too
often, Cowell said, the state has to
estimate what the federal govern-
ment plans to do about the budget
when it comes to the question of
higher education. This handicaps
the state’s effort to provide better
service for the students that plan to

Relationship

continued from page four

Brooks said that we all too often
ignorantly project characteristics
onto members of the opposite sex.

“When a woman meets a man who
is charming and witty, wearing a tie
and a neatly pressed suit, she
assumes that he’s a good catch — as
if there’s any relationship between
character and manners,” he said.
“Good grammar doesn’t necessarily
mean good character."

According to Brooks, we all have
an inner need for belonging and
acceptance, which draws us to
others.

“I meet someone on the bus to
Ocean City,” he explained. “We
keep looking for what we have in
common. It turns out that she’s from
Cincinnati and I had an uncle who
once worked there. That’s enough.
Or she likes waterskiing and I like
snow skiing. That’ll do. We’ll make
it fit. ‘You’re my kind of person,’ I
say. ‘We have a lot in common.’
What the hell do we have in com-
mon? We're on vacation. We’re

' looking for a little fun. That's what

we have in common."

Two people can decide to spend
the rest of their lives together based
on the fact that they both love to
dance. In reality, they don’t know
each other at all.

“You have the right to find out
who this person. is before you
embark on a serious relationship,"
Brooks said. “Talk to each other. If
you can't get him to talk with flowers
and candy, how can you expect him
to talk when the toilet is stopped up
and the bills aren't paid?”

Brooks elaborated on a set of pos-
itive guidelines for establishing and
maintaining a healthy relationship.
The first is a look at a person’s
family.

“Conducting a relationship is a

attend college.

According to a survey read by
congressman Gaydos, the number of
Pennsylvania high school seniors
who consider themselves college-
bound increased from 47.8 percent
in I979 to 52 percent in 1984. About
eight out of every 10 are planning to
complete at least a bachelor’s degree
program, but Pennsylvanians are
much less likely to complete a gradu-
ate degree: 34.5 percent in Pennsyl-
vania, 44.8 percent in other states.

Gaydos went on to say that the
average family income of Pennsyl-
vanian college-bound students is I4
percent lower than the national
average while the costs of attending
a four-year college in Pennsylvania
are 17 to 19 percent higher than costs
at institutions in other states.

Costs are a leading factor in
choosing a college. Instead ofchoos-
ing the university of their choice,
many students are forced to pick a
college on financial conditions
alone. This was a concern for Dr.
Rebecca Stafford, president of Cha-
tham College. In her testimony
before the subcommittee, she said,

“My concerns are not just for Cha-

tham, but for higher education in
general. Specifically I am concerned
about women being shuffled aside in
some universities. Students must be
allowed to select the university of
their choice or else education will
suffer.”

Stafford believes education will
suffer because most students will
study programs strictly on the basis
of after-college employment in order
to repay college loans. In doing this,
Stafford believes that the humani-
ties could be neglected and private
colleges will suffer a loss of enroll-
ment as the students. limit their
education. - I

Robert Comfort, an associate

dean of the College of General Stu-
dies at Pitt, also testified about the
importance of continued and
improved financial aid for part-time
students.

In his statements before the com-
mittee, Comfort said, “I get
extremely upset when a student tells

me she has to drop out because she
does not have $25 for books.

Another student, a single parent V,
with two school-age children, relates

quite sadly that she cannot continue
because she cannot be away from
her children more than one night a
week, her salary as a secretary does
not stretch beyond household
expenses to tuition and no aid or
loans are available to her since she
can attend only one course per

semester. These are real cases. Both »

are superior students. This is a tragic
loss for them and our community."

Comfort went on to say: “Central
university admissions and financial
aid offices normally do not process
the part-timers who are admitted
through a continuing education unit
and consequently ignore this group
of students while dispensing aid.
Those involved with Pitt’s College of
General Studies intend to begin to
fight for these monies within our
own institution.”

Burkart Holzner, director of the
University Center for International
Studies at Pitt, said, “In my mind,
the continuation and modest expan-
sion of Title IV ofthe Higher Educa-

tion Act is an urgent requirement in .

terms of the national interest of the
United States.

“There is a consensus among pro-
fessional educators as well as know-
Iedgeables in the international
business community and in the
defense community that the country
faces a challenge to improve its
international education programs at
all levels similar to the challenges
faced in science and mathamatics
education,” Holzner added.

Dr. Elizabeth Baranger also con-
tributed to the discussion on the
importance of graduate education.
Baranger, a dean of Graduate Stu-
dies at Pitt, said: “We as a nation
have been successful in developing
high-quality graduate education
programs. But it is imperative that
we not lose sight of the continuing
and increased need for these pro-
grams. The reauthorization of a
stronger higher Education Act will
help us achieve these goals.”

“There is an illness
among good people
that makes them bad
mates. Some people
are so obsessed with
the way things are
supposed to be that
they cannot celebrate
the way things are.”
—Dr. Ralph Brooks

learned skill,” Brooks explained,
“one that we learn by observing the
example ofthose around us. Before I
decide to embark on a serious rela-
tionship with you, I want to know
what kind of example you had. I
want to know your present relation-
ship with your family, how it affects
you today. If there are unresolved
conflicts between you and your fam-
ily, it won’t be long before they affect
you and me.”

This leads into a second impor-
tant guideline: communication, an
ability Brooks calls “the prerequisite
skill to the building and saving of
relationships.

“Society brainwashes men to
believe that it’s not masculine to
express feelings," Brooks said. “ ‘I
love her,’ a guy will say, ‘Ijust don't
want to talk. I don’t want Charlie
McCarthy, I want a quiet compan-
ion.’ But it is the ability to talk and
work through differences, some-
times with ‘tears and anger, that
saves relationships."

And according to Brooks, you
can‘t do it after the I I o'clock news.
It takes time and effort.

The third important guideline
concerns sex. Although he does not
want to advocate premarital sex,
Brooks says that it’s important to
know where a person stands on this
issue.

“Some say that you should see
how he acts when he’s stuck in traf-
fic,” Brooks explained. “Well, that
may not be the best indicator. But it
is important to examine his frustra-
tion tolerance. How is he at waiting?
How does he satisfy his appetites in
general? How does he handle power

. —- does he readily apologize? If he’s

never wrong, guess what that's going
to make you?”

Finally, Brooks described ﬂexibil-
ity as the fourth important guideline
for maintaining a relationship.

“There is an illness among good
people that makes them bad mates,”
Brooks said. “Some people are so
obsessed with the idea of the way
things are supposed to be that they
cannot celebrate the way things are.
This kind of inﬂexibility can have a
negative influence on any relation-
ship. Ask yourself, how well do you
roll with the punches?”

Above all, Brooks stressed the
importance of taking enough time to
get to know a person before you
decide to make the relationship
permanent. "

“You need to be with someone
over a long period of time and in a
wide variety of circumstances," he
explained. “You can't get to know a
person on Friday night dates. A suc-
cessful, intimate relationship is

extremely hard work. It requires ‘

time and effort, and even then there
are no guarantees. But when we
make a commitment to another per-
son, we offer ourselves to them, and
we can trust that even if that person
cannot be there for us today, he will
be there when we need him.”

Coke change: Big-time crisis

Coke is it. Or perhaps Coke was it.
Maybe the new Coke is it. No! I’m
almost positive the Coca-Cola Clas-
sic is it. Oh, and what is “it," one
might wonder. “It's” the real thing,
of course. Sure.

‘Recently, various news media
have dabbled with the Coca-Cola
issue with a dramatic furor and
determination seen only with the
coverage of the tornado tragedy-in
western Pennsylvania and the recent
TWA hostage crisis in Beirut,
Lebanon.

I guess I do realizethat Coca-Cola
has become an American tradition,
right alongside baseball, apple pie
and nuclear waste.

Who says we need a hostage crisis
to bring the American people
together against evil forces? Merely
threaten to change — ever so slightly
—- the taste of a soft drink, especially
Coca-Cola, and the country unites.

People were enraged. How could
anyone even think of changing an
American tradition? Forget the
American hostages. Never mind
world hunger. Don’t worry about
high unemployment rates. We want
the old Coke back!

Nationwide, news media ate this
right up. Now this was a genuine
crisis. Coca-Cola Company received
thousands of phone calls from irate

F

consumers. Many angered citizens
formed protest groups and sought
signatures to petition the dreadful
change. And the media were there,
surveying the masses, interviewing
beverage distributors, and intensely
interrogating Coca-Cola officials.
How could those officials do such a
thing?

War. That’s right. You see, the
entire issue was created as an act of
war against a cruel but valiant
enemy —— Pepsi-Cola Company.
And this raging battle has undoubt-
edly divided our nation more than
once.

That makes for good news cover-
age, don’t you think? And I can only
wonder if media encouraged it. Why
not? After all, it’s war, right?

Anyhow, last week, Coca-Cola
Company announced its return to

_ the original formula. Twas a media

bonanza for sure. The New York
Times reserved a space on its front
page for the story. Pittsburgh area
television news shows dropped ever-
ything to cover this American dream
come true. Next to the recent hos-
tage crisis, this was the story of the
month.

Sitting on the edge of my seat at
this point, I am waiting anxiously
for the next move by the rivaling

Unbeatable copying

price. July 22-31.  

factions of the American beverage
industry. And, if something really
does happen, I can assure you that
the media will be there.

But until then, I think I will quit
drinking either beverage and start
drinking milk. Just call me a
diplomat. '

Letter to the Editor

Molly Rush wants to know why
some people, particularly Maurice
Mallin, think her arguments against
the Strategic Defense Initiative are
illogical (“Rush Responds," The Pitt
News, July 3, 1985). I cannot speak
for Mr. Mallin, nor do I need to, so
speaking for myself, I would like to
give her question the answer it
deserves.

First, Ms. Rush is arguing from
authority. In other words, some-
thing is true because so-and-so said
it is true. This proves nothing
because, among other reasons, dif-
ferent “authorities” are often in con-
flict. While James Schlesinger, Carl
Sagan and Helen Caldicott believe
SDI is a bad idea, Edward Teller,
Robert Jastrow and Ben Bova are all
for it. Who says something is not as
important as why they say it.

Second, even if argument from
authority were valid, some of Ms.
Rush’s authorities are not as author-
itative as sh_e would like them to be.
Not only does one not need to be a

scientist to join the Union of Con-
cerned Scientists — one need only
subscribe to a science-oriented mag-
azine which sells its mailing list to
the UCS — most scientists don’t
belong to UCS or any other scien-
tific organization which has received
media attention for opposing SDI.
Even if most scientists were UCS
members, most scientists are not
military strategists rendering their
opinion on the subject no better than
anyone else.

Finally, let us not overlook some-
thing neither Ms. Rush nor the
media is telling us: there is a space-
based defense plan which could be
deployed in a relatively short time,
uses only off-the-shelf technology
and would cost as little as 50 percent
of what the Reagan administration
wants to spend on research alone for
its “Star Wars” plan. ‘

BIOHISTORY
Arno Karlen
Little, Brown Publishers

Since history began to be pur-
posely recorded, a debate has
raged over just what force deter-
mines the course of history: Is it
the force of great men, or is it the
force of powerful events?

Devotees of the great man the-
ory have pointed to the military
and political prowess of Napo-
leon in changing forever the des-.
tiny of the European continent.
Great eventers counter that it
was the harsh Russian winter
which turned Napoleon back to
Waterloo. Roughly three-
quarters of a century ago, a third
theory entered the historical
debate — a theory which we
might call, in Napoleon’s case,
the great gland theory.

In 1913, Dr. Leonard Guthrie,
a London neurologist, suggested
that Napoleon suffered from
Frohlich’s syndrome, a pituitary
gland deficiency that affects
growth, sexuality and emotions.

25 O’CLOCK A
The Dukes of the Stratosphear
Virgin Records

It is rather difficult to be both
innocuous and garishly psyche-
delic. But somehow, 25 O’Clock,’
the new debut from the Dukes of
Stratosphear, manages to blend
in with other new psych bands,
such as the Three O’Clock, the
Vipers, the Fuzztones, etc.
Which says a lot.

While everyone is quite happy
to don their paisley and grow
haircuts sillier than even punk
could inspire and get caught up
in the excitement ofa new move-
ment, someone forgot to make
sure that they were copying the
right music. So, as the result ofa
small oversight, simple ’60s gar-
age trash (see early Frank
Zappa, such as “Freak Out”) is
being recycled as the new psy-
chedelic sound.

Well, the Dukes of Stratos-
phear are the real McCoy — and
I’m not talking about Julie
McCoy, your cruise director.
This ain’t no party. This stuff is
groovy. Judge from the liner
notes the earnestness and
authenticity of the band:

‘The Dukes'say it’s time  it's

was roughly 5-7, a fully respecta-
ble tallness for his time, thus
eliminating the so-called Napo-
leon complex from any list of
reasons for Napoleon’s decline
and fall). In its most severe form,
Frohlich’s syndrome arrests
body and genital development
and causes obesity, mental dete-
rioration, and low physical and
mental energy.

Dr. Leonard’s hypothesis,
however, springs from a theory
put forth by Dr. Walter Henry, a
British physician who partici-
pated in Napoleon’s-rather cur-
sory autopsy. Dr. Henry wrote
that.Bonaparte was “quite fat
and his skin pale, delicate,

, almost without body hair. The

pubis much resembled the mons
vernis in women. The muscles of
the chest were small, the
shoulders narrow and the hips
wide. The penis and testicles
were very small, and the whole
genital system seemed to exhibit
a physical cause for the absence
of sexual desire  ”Immediately
after going on about Napoleon’s
fatness, though, Dr. Henry
wrote, “The whole body was

“The Emperor’s New Suit,” isn’t
it? Well, against better judge-

you in on a secret. This is no
synth band that suddenly saw
the virtues of lysergic acid dieth-
ylamide. It’s those brilliant Brit
pop lads, XTC. '

And this is parody. People
always said XTC sounded like
early Lennon—McCartney; now
they sound like late Lennon-
McCartney.

As far as humor goes, it's up
there with This Is Spinal Tap
and Monty Python’s ‘Beatles
take-off band, the Rutles. Every-
thing, except the name XTC,
which is completely absent from
this package, is there: the pseud-
onymous band (Sir John Johns
— singing, guitar, brain buds;

the Red Curtain —— electric bass, I

song stuff; Lord Cornelius Plum
—— mellotron, piano, organ, fuzz-
tone guitar; and E.l.E.I. Owen
—~ drum set); the hippie lyrics
(lots of colors ﬂying, flowers
walking and assorted vibrations,
not‘ to mention sky-touching);
backward masking (of course!);
and state-of-the-art production
(circa 1968, that is).

So the ingredients are there.
But without XTC’s keen song-
writing, sense of humor and
impeccable taste, 25 0’Clock
could have easily degenerated
into hippie nonsense. As it
stands, it's psychedelic, but_ you
don’t have to be part of a War-
holian counterculture to enjoy it.

tNAPOLEON’S GLANDS
‘ AND OTHER VENTURES IN

slender and effeminate.” Appar-
ently, Dr. Henry and his col-
leagues were about the business
of medicine far less than the bus-
iness of directing history.

In light of all this, it is easy to
understand how biohistory —— an
attempt to prove that man's biol-
ogy may be a primary factor in
determining the course of
human interaction — has been
largely ignored, regarded as the
phrenology of the study of his-
tory. Arno Karlen’s Napoleon’s
Glands and Other Ventures in
Biohistory, however, goes a long
way toward correcting that.

Napoleon ‘s Glands is tirelessly
scientific; Karlen is exhaustive in
his research. In the third chapter
— “What Ailed Poor Poe, The
Biohistorian as Skeptic” —- he
points out evidence that Edgar
Allen Poe did not, contrary to
years of statements to the con-
trary, drink a lot. I remember
seeing a film on Poe when I was
in the fifth grade which showed
Poe drinking up a veritable

storm, staggering through the

streets and finally upsetting a
bottle of dark purple wine all
over an unfinished manuscript.

Although the film eloquently
symbolized the effect of what

Side one opens with the title
track and ajumble ofcontrapun—
tal clocks, erupting into a bass-

line that more than harkens
“Paint It Black.” “Bike Ride to

the. Moon” follows, “full of

thrumming bass and vocal
hooks, sounding as much like
early XTC as the Strawberry
Alarm Clock (I think I was born
to late to understand the affinity
these psychedelic bands have for
time). “My Love Explodes” —
think about that title for a min-
ute —— starts with a guitar so
fuzzy it would make the Flesh-
tones teeter, then plunges into a
raucous verse not terribly unlike
the Banana Split theme song
(you know, “One banana, two
banana, three banana, four  ),
climaxing with an explosion —
presumably Sir John John’s
love.

was allegedly to be Poe’s drunk-
enness on his literary career, it
was almost wholly without his-

torical merit. Poe apparently
suffered from a condition, rare
in Caucasians but relatively
common in most Asians and
Africans, known as alcohol
dehydrogenase deficiency syn-
drome. Alcohol dehydrogenase
is an enzyme that breaks down
alcohol in the body. Poe didn’t
have enought, so when he drank,
— and such instances were rare
—— he required only one or two
glasses of wine to become com-
pletely intoxicated.

Perhaps the most valuable
aspect of Napoleonic Glands is
its eminent readability.
Although it is. as I have said.

Side two sounds to be later
psychedelic -— more wigged out,
if you will.)

“What in the World.” and
“Your Gold Dress” are both
slower, more ponderous songs
than those on the ﬂipside --
“cosmic," in fact, might be a
more appropriate word.

Both songs feature sitar
sounds and ethereal vocals and I,
for one, can imagine eating
music to both of these uncannily
Beatlesish ditties. But if these
two songs smack of the Fab
Four, hold onto your bellbot—
toms; the best is about to arrive.

“The Mole from the Minis-

tirelessly scientific (Karlen
leaves no avenue untried and is
not afraid to address contradic-
tions), it is not tiresome. Karlen
avoids the refuge of obscurity
and oversized words to which so
many others who have attempt-

ed to address history scientiﬁ- ‘

cally have fled.

Were it not for the fact that
Napoleon’s Glands is scientific,
full of information of general as
well as specific interest, fully
readable and a pioneer primary
resource in its field — in short,
useful to the mind — I would
recommend that it be used as a
college textbook.

STEBHEN LEWIS,

try,” which closes the album,
begins with heavily ﬂanged
vocals —~ if you could record
underwater, this is what it would
sound like -— and breaks into a
piano-led march that soundsflike
the lost song from “Magical

Mystery Tour.” It’s worth the A

price of the album to hear this
song. —

But 25 0’Clock is not Beatle-
mania —- nothing is ripped off.
It’s just as if XTC sat down to
record a new album wearing
Nehru jackets and Roger
McGuinn glasses and this came
out of it. Far out.

Country and Western meets

boredom and

STAYING OUT LATE WITH
BEAT RODEO

Beat Rodeo

I.R.S.

I don’t know about you, but
I’m getting really bored with this
country and western Tex-Mex

I revival. We’ve got Jason and the

Scorchers. We’ve got Lone Jus-
tice. We’ve got Los (yawn)
Lobos. The latest contender to
the country-rock snooze Hall of
Fame is a cute li’l ol’ Noo Yawk
band called Beat Rodeo, whose
debut lp, Staying Out Late With

V Beat Rodeo, is guaranteed to put

you to sleep faster than you can
say “Hee Haw!”

Produced primarily by the
stalwart North Carolina duo of
Mitch Easter and Don Dixon
(R.E.M., Let’s_ Active), the
album is a stunning display of
lame, uninspired riffing teamed
with even less inspired Everly
Brothers harmonies. Like most
of their drawling contemporar-'
ies, Beat Rodeo seem to shun
imagination, opting instead for
the safe route of rehashing and
regurgitating.

It's as pretentious as the genre
comes. The band’s leaders, gui-
tarists/vocalists Steve Almaas
and Bill Schunk, hail from Min-
neapolis and Long Island,
respectively. Yet to hear them

sing, you’d think they just
crawled out of the Loozyanna
bayou. '

Dig the lyrics: We’re gettin’
closer each time that we meet/
No one compares/ No one else

 

teolium and loses

can compete/ When you're
smilin’ at me and I just wanna
die/ Aw then, look in my eyes,
Mimi. Excuse me, fellas, are you
familiar with the word
“vacuous”? *

To be fair, the album isn't
utterly wretched. There are, in
fact, two or three kind of inter-
esting moments: “Not the Girl
Loves Me,” with its bass guitar/
snare drum intro, threatens to be
entertaining but of course isn’t;
“Take You Home” has a brief
hook in the chorus but it was
probably an accident; “Without
You” is pretty good if only
because the melody derives from
the early Beatles instead of
George Jones; and “Who’s

Fuzztones and the art

LYSYRGIC EMANATIONS
F uzztones
ABC Records

The inner sleeve of Lysyrgic
Emanations is filled with more
hype than a press kit. A biogra-
phical note that describes the
Fuzztone’s lead singer boasts:
Whether snarlin’ out his snotty
mating call or pumpin ’screamin ’
fuzz outta his Vintage Vox
Phantom (a gift from a fan!)
Rudi Protrudi seems to epito-
mize Bad Attitude. Who needs
to listen to the record? I almost
fell in love with Rudi Protrudi’s
voice and his guitar playing
before even hearing them. How-
ever, I did eventually feel com-
pelled to remove Lysyrgic
Emanations from its bombastic
packaging and actually play it.
Not surprisingly, I discovered
that Protrudi and the F uzztones
fake a bad attitudemuch better
than they epitomize it. And this
seems to be their intent; “Ema-
nations” is cut with the same
gimmicky style (and some of the
same sound effects) as a B-“freak
out” movie circa 1967.

 

Like virtually all psychedelic/
garage rock groups, the Fuzz-
tones can be compared to over a
half dozen other bands. Self-
proclaimed snot and former
Dead Boy Protrudi sounds a lot
like the lead singer of the Stan-
dells. Because the Fuzztones
have what they refer to as a
“trashtone” organ in their line-
up, Doors/Fuzztones analogies

are irresistible, but nonetheless _

most useless. Only “Just Once,”
a psychedelic ballad, has a dis-
tinctive Morrisonian gloom
about it. Vaguely plagiarized
from any Doors song, “Just
Once” is ironically one of the
Fuzztones more sincere and suc-
cessful attempts at psychedelic
mood music. Even with its wind
noises (I don’t know what else to
call them), it has some haunting
acoustic guitar and a pretty
melody.

The Fuzztones start to wear
their paisley a little thin with psy-
chedelic ﬁller like “Radar Eyes,”
a droning song which sports the
lyrics “Fly girl ﬂy/Cry, cry,
cry/ In your eyes I hope I find

 

Gonna Be Around,” with its Ry K

Cooderish breaks, turns out to
be listenable (I even stayed
awake for it).

The rest of the album, how-
ever, is a complete bore. In the
musical form of rock (wherein it
is easy to be at least interesting),
being a bore is inexcusable.
There are hundreds of bands,
some right here in Pittsburgh,
that don’t happen to have major-
label record contracts but could
blow Beat Rodeo into the
stratosphere.

Don’t stay out late with Beat
Rodeo. Listen to the radio or
watch TV and go to bed early.

STEPHEN MORRISON

of deia vu

hope in your radar scope/ Don’t
die, don’t die, don’t die.” This
song is against vocoderized
back-up vocals and I think
there's even a harp somewhere in
there. —

Happily, a little less than half
ofthe songs on Lysyrgic Emana-
tions are cheesey little mind
benders like “Radar Eyes.” “I2-
5” is a great Standells sounding
number with a wild harmonica
and trademark Fuzztone guitar
work. “Gotta Get Some” is an
appropriate fast expression of
male, teen-aged lust. “Cinder-
ella,” the album’s only cover, has
more neat harmonica and a
“hey, hey, hey, hey” chorus.

If someone told you this
album was made in the mid to
late ’60s you’d think it was really
good and pretty amusing. If
someone told you it was made a
few months ago, you'd think it
was pretty good, -king of amus-
ing, and if you had friends who
weren’t “Dead Heads” and wore
tie-died T-shirts anyway, you’d
play it at your parties.

J\JLI II, I7Uu'

Beer, s|<it’rle

It was open house at the Fil-
more Street residence of the
“Head Martyr” of the western
world when Adam Eisenstadt
hosted all and sundry for a little
bit of self-serving promotional
shock therapy to counteract the
libidinous/ saccharine aftertaste

of the “live-aid show” on Satur- *

day, June 13, 1985.

In a turgid promotional coup,
the local visionary band known
“The Bad Martyrs”attempted to

lure the hearts and minds of

unsuspecting youth into their
twisted world of psychic
garbage.

I will hand it to Herr Eisen-

stadt, he certainly has his mani- '

pulative mandibles firmly upon
the doomscape of minutiae
which is his mind.

Lusty and busty wenches
served frosty flagons of ale, and
fretful plates of periwinkles to
the sweat—soaked and mind-
benumbed Hoi-Poli. ~Why? So
Herr Eisenstadt could have a
captive audience to absorb his
unique concoction of American

A’70s pop, and original words and

music.

Herr Eisenstadt admitted in a
rare telephone interview that he
is not the world’s greatest singer,
but he refused to make conces-
sions on any other point con-
cerning the genesis and
mythology of himself and/or
The Bad Martyrs.

Herr Eisenstadt is not a man
who takes his Judaism lightly; he
has a comic/serious overview of
the futility and vanity of huma-
nist socio-political schemes. I
wondered if his goal were not an
attempt on his part to leave his
unsuspecting minions “... where
Jesus left the Jews,” to quote
Joyce’s Simon Dedalus.

Eisenstadt obviously under-
stands that his ace-in-the—hole,
orally-aggressive verbal narcis-
sism, is best suited to the printed
page. He passed out photocopies
of his lyrics to the audience he
had lured into his lair through
the promise of “free beer.” Per-
haps the finest description of
Eisenstadt’s promo-blitz can be
found in his own song “Aban-
doned,” where in the final cho-
rus are these rasped and ravaged
words:

s ondrock    
oi the Filmore

Strangers, fools and

to set them free.

Yeah, but hand me here

ﬁlled ship

this confusion

where we go.

swath

In the end I must report that it
was a worthy occasion. How
many musicians or poets would
attempt to scramble to the top of
the Steel’ City’s rock-heap in
mock obliviousness to the
famine-drenched millions in
Ethiopia. Which way do we go
from here, ladies and gentlemen?
Only Herr Eisenstadt knows for
sure, and as long as it’s beer and
skittles, my ear is cocked and my
foot is in the door.

Legalizing compensation for the athlete

By Mark A.‘Sind|er
Special for The Pitt News

Editor's note: (This is the second
of a two-part series looking into
whether athIete/ students, particu-
larly football and basketbaIIp!ayers,
should be compensated for their
extracurricular activities. The ﬁrst
part ran last week.)

For most of the past 11 years,
numerous proposals with a common
theme have found their way to the
NCAA annual convention in Janu-
ary. Seeking to return to the pre-
I974 days when football and
basketball players received $15 per
month for sundry expenses, spon-
sors have sought to thread similar
compensatory packages back into
the fabric pf Division 1.

Maybe reward it here or be more
compromising there. To no avail.
Such packages have never received
the necessary two—thirds majority of
the entire NCAA voting body,
which regularly passes major legisla-
tion and amendments during its
annual convention.

Given this aversion to granting
money outright, possible compensa-
tion appears dead in the wind as the
NCAA begins assembling another
agenda. for another convention, this
time in New Orleans toward late
January 1986.

Trends aside, several goings-on
around the country may once again
put the revenue-producing athlete
into the black.

Perhaps at the heart of this reform

is Pitt athletic director Ed Bozik. ’

Prior to a College Football Associa-
tion —— a consortium of Divisionl
football teams, iltcluding the Pan-
thers —- meeting in Dallas last
month, Bozik initiated a proposal

that would earmark $600 each year,

to players through an exchange sys-
tem involving‘ complementary
tickets- ’ I '
Two state senators are in the process
of sponsoring bills that would
finance Division I athletes in Cali-
fornia and Nebraska.

The publisher of a recently-

started newsletter Student-Athlete
claims to have considerable support
from administrators and players for
blueprint plans that would channel
most of the revenue players earn
back to themselves.

And, as in past years, several
coaches and athletic directors advo-
cate compensation of some sort, if
only the correct balance of support
can be attained to pass such ideas
into law. ‘

Word of Bozik’s plan first sur-

faced ‘June 2 when the CFA,’s

 

Dr. Ed Bozik

coaches committee recommended
giving players $600 during a 10-
month span for incidental expenses.
The money would be generated by
selling the four free tickets they
receive for each of the ll games
played. I '

"This has been an idea I've sup-
ported for some time,” Bozik said
earlier this month. “There's not
enough added money to cover
expenses for normal college living.
You can't work during the school
year, so you can't generate extra
funds. There's a need there for kids.
To alleviate that, my suggestion was
the complimentary tickets be done
away with.”

Such a proposal, which heads for
the convention ﬂoor in January,
does more than create player finan-
ces. First, it would eliminate need
for a gate list, which serves as an

outlet for the player tickets. Before
last year, players would give their
allotment to whomever they chose.
That led to rampant abuse, includ-
ing scalping above face value. So the
NCAA outlawed that practice and
instead requires the players’ guests
to pick up their tickets on game day
at a certain gate.

' That, Bozik said, was an adminis-
trative nightmare last year. Moreso,
so that the players may receive
tickets for away games, _athletic
departments must purchase those
tickets at face cost. The expense
averages $12 to $18 dollars. Bozik
has already heard the counterargu-
merits. And he has an answer for
each one: ,

Olf stadiums, especially Pitt, do
not sell out, nothing is lost by hand-
ing players complimentary tickets.
“My counterproposal is away
games.” .

Olf football and basketball play-
ers, who can be outfitted under Boz-
ik's plan, are compensated, why not
all collegiate athletes? “My answer is

to [apply this-to] any sport that

raises money —— on purely economic
terms.”

0What if mom and pop want to
see junior_start but are slighted by
having to pay to do so? “Well, mom
and dad can buy the tickets or the
son can buy them the tickets
instead.”

As Bozik admitted, “only a sub-
stantial groundswell of support”
come January ensures this propos-
al’s working utility. “The virtue is
that you eliminate two problems
[gate

solutions so far."

As chairman of the committee -

that bought Bozik’s proposal, Vince
Dooley recently addressed himself
to the petty offenses plaguing the
NCAA. Receiving free use of autos,
secret cash funds and illegal loans,
among others.

“Probably every football coach
feels there needs to be a return to
what was done," said Dooley, who is-
football coach and athletic director
at Georgia. “Small compensation

dime problems and situations in

recruiting [illegal inducements].
That's the general feeling.”

Still, the prospects of showing
such legislation past a two-thirds
majority seem ill-fated.

“The general problem has to do
with having to provide for other ath-
letes," Dooley added. “The cost is
prohibitive. You can't fund it. That’s
why the ticket situation is a way
around it." '

“It's hard to estimate what chance
we have," Bozik said.

“I certainly wouldn't want to pre-
dict what would happen and what
would change or how,” said NCAA
Assistant Executive Director Ted C.
Tow. “The traditional belief is that a
full ride designates more than any
other student is getting. What a
student-athlete gets is his or her way
through college. A pretty sizeable
chunk of money. I happen to per-
sonally favor that point of view.

“Let's look at the definition of
what the NCAA calls ‘commonly
accepted educational expenses.’ If
that were moved out of the constitu-
tion by two-thirds majority and then
acted separately upon by each div-
ision, then you could make the argu-
ment that the I-A would change the
definition to monthly stipend.
Again, nothing is entrenched.
Things always change, and the same
is true of that in the NCAA.”

Is it true that a full four-year scho-
larship is not enough in return fora
running back’s off-tackle break or
the continued showmanship of a
dominating center?

Two men within the NCAA inner
circles still believe the scholarship —
usuallyproviding room, board, tui-

tion, books —-— carries the required.

weight. Notre Dame Athletic Direc-
tor Gene Corrigan and Syracuse
basketball coach Jim Boeheim point
to the expenses their respective
schools force upon prospective
undergraduates: with today’s infla-
tion, approximately $50,000 for four
years at each school.

“Schools say, ‘well give you an
education and a degree,’ " Corrigan
said. “That’s a heck ofa deal. If you
don't promise them a degree, then
pay them. I don't think, otherwise,
anyone needs to get paid.”

Said Boeheim: “I never want to
see a paid situation,” said Boeheim.
“If college athletes can have a good
summer job and get a Pell Grant
[$900 permitted P out of annual
$1,800 ceiling], his benefits are good.
The thing people tend to forget is
that they don't see what crew doesn't
make or what women’s track doesn't
make. That's where the money goes.
It's not making the university
wealthy."

Dick DeVenzio is of a different
mind. He pens the newsletter
Student-Athlete from his Charlotte,
N.C., home. And he has been calling
for a restructuring of revenue chan-
neling after it is generated by basket-
ball players who attract sellout
crowds and bring notoriety to
schools reaching the prestigious
NCAA Tournament.

“Scholarships seem like such
wonderful things, and they're not,"
DeVenzio said. “One of the outs I
hear are how valuable an education
they're getting. All they're getting
are several thousand dollars becaues
if they apply for financial aid, they
can still go."

If not nationally, at least in these
parts, DeVenzio is~known for his
helping Pitt recruit Tico Cooper
emigrate from his homeland of
Aruba in 1983, Twelve years before
that, DeVenzio ended an illustrious
career as point guard at Duke Uni-
versity and today stands as the Blue
Devils’ career assists leader.

Now, after pushing himself
through a decade of overseas com-
petition and aiding Cooper's transi-
tion, DeVenzio is onto a different
track- He challenges the NCAA.
Although he hasn't yet addressed
football players, DeVenzio aims a

SPORTS/THE PITT NEWS WEEKLY/PAGE i 1

Part II: The problem — to pay or not to pay?

continued from page ten

four-tier revenue redistribution plan
at basketball players.

He separates nearly one-half of all
Division I schools, the top revenue
producers, “to deal with their own
unique situation." Limiting the 120
(random) schools to three scholar-
ships per year, he anticipates just
under $10 million would be needed
to cover undergraduate and post-
graduate schooling.

Along with unspecified compen-

“; sation, DeVenzio also maps out a

;.a

£3‘

$10-million endowment fund for
remedial programs; a $2-million ret-
roactive scholarship pool for former
athlete-students without degrees
who wish to obtain one, and a $9
million “worthwhile project” fund
for approximately 300 graduates a
year.

The annual funding would come
from the $30 million (the 1985 tour-
nament grossed receipts nearing $33
million) he estimated is generated by
the 64-team NCAA Tournament.

“It is a radical plan,” DeVenzio
said, “but there have been only tiny,
piecemeal efforts so far. It may be
time when something more radical
should be done where people are
shaken to understand what players
aren’t making.

“People are saying kids should get
$25 or $50 a month. Sounds like a
grand statement. I don’t want to
alienate anybody, but it sounds like
you’re trying to appease others. The
situation has to be redefined in peo-
ple’s minds. That’s my major thrust.
People aren’t acknowledging that

the only thing not professional
about student-athletes is that they
are kids. Everything else is
[professional].”

Since his newsletter began publi-
cation in March, conclusions drawn
from reactions to DeVenzio’s
schemes are slow in coming. How-
ever, he does claim to have the back-
ing of Joe Paterno, Dean Smith,
Duke's Mike Krzyzewski, and Loui-
siana State‘s Dale Brown and Bill
Arsnparger.

His detractors, however, nearly
double the supporters.

“I’m not surewhat [DeVenzio’s]
advocating," Corrigan remarked. “I
think he is advocating they get paid.
What more does a school owe [a
player]? And do they owe him
more?"

“My understanding of Dick
DeVenzio’s cause is he supports the
idea not only of additional compen-
sation, but all kinds of benefits like
use of a car,” Tow said. “I don't have
a position on that or comments. But
he’s fighting an uphill battle just as
are coaches who support compensa-
tion even though their administra-
tors believe in something to the
contrary.

“One thing overlooked in all this,
or undervalued,” Bozik concluded
“Is there are athletes getting an edu-
cation. People often forget that, or it
is understated. Not many kids on
scholarship come from poor
families."

Proposals such as those authored
by Bozik and DeVenzio come under
the direct scrutiny of the NCAA vot-
ing members. It is those members,
however, who would not muster
similar control of forces emanating

from outside the association.

In this case, such pressure is being
supplied by two state senators with
compensation on their minds. One is
Nebraska’s Ernest Chambers, a l5-
year legislator from the I lth District
(Omaha) who, since 1981, has been
actively seeking direct compensa-
tion of Nebraska football players.

His track record indicates that
Chambers, one ofthe state’s handful
of black lawmakers, will not sur-
render easily. Past perserverance
includes forcing a minister to forego
the $319 paid to him monthly for
delivering invocations at daily ses-
sions. Successful in his prayer-
without-pay lobby, Chambers later
battled state patrolmen‘s use of
radar guns. ‘ ‘

Now legislative bill 499, reintro-
duced after defeat in 1983, shines in
the face of Nebraska’s most indocri-
nating cult: Big Red football.
Athletic director Bob Devaney, a
legend within the state, refuses to
acknowledge Chambers nowadays.

All Chambers wants is for the
Cornhuskers to be classified as state
employees. “I’d been upset about the
over-emphasis of football for a
number of years,” Chambers said
last month. “I'm concerned about
the fact that there's no attention
given to the players themselves.
Since these guys put in so much
time, they’re entitled to some kind of
pay. The ideas have been so foreign
to them that when I first proposed it
in 1980 or ’8l that theyjust looked at
me and stared. Face it, they’re forced
to spend more time out of the class-
room than in it.

“This has nothing to do with aca-
demics. Suppose you’re out of class
for a period of time, then the profes-

sor will push you through, give you a
passing mark. But if you miss a sin-
gle practice, well, l’ve been told
coaches wouldn’t let some walk.”
Bob Devaney, when quizzed
about his knowledge of Chambers,
refused to discuss his “interest” in
Nebraska football. “We feel — the
student-athlete —— we would like to
compensate them," Devaney said.
“But we feel that if we do that, we're
forced to compensate all other ath-
letes. As for other athletic endea-
vors, why, there isn’t much push for
that. But, if football or basketball,
we’ll get a push that all forms of
athletes must be compensated."
“They’re very upset,” Chambers
said of Nebraska officials. “They

don’t like the idea; they don't like me ,

because I’ve said there is the overem-
phasis. Because I am critical, I’m
least liked and least respected in this
state."

Chambers is not alone in eyeing
Division I revenue producers.
Joseph Montova, a California
Democratic senator in his second
term, is preparing to introduce legis-
lation this fall to classify athlete-
students under the state’s
interpetation of workman’s
compensation.

“He doesn't so much want to pay
them as he wants to cover them in
the event of an injury," said Kathy
Somerton, a Montoya aide who is
gathering background information.

Before any bill is introduced,
Montoya must pass an exploratory
hearing in early fall, “where people,
who will be impacted by the legisla-
tion, will testify on whether the legis-
lation is necessary or not,”
Somerton said.

She added, “The feeling is we’ll

Pitt and Georgia are shown ‘opposing each other in the I982 Sugar Bowl, but officials from both schools
took the same stand under the College Football Association in regards to paying student-athletes.

write the bill, but how so and what
areas will be addressed [are] still up
in the air. Some of[Montoya’s] con-
cerns stemmed from public universi-
ties and the tax money they receive,
the scholarships given to student-
athletes and the fact that schools
make money off the players.”

According to Tow, the NCAA
already sponsors both catastrophic
injury programs and insurance plans
covering other injuries suffered by
athletes.

Chambers seeks similar work-
men’s compensation classification in
his bill.

The proposals and counterprop-
osals are clustered as perhaps never
before. Those within the NCAA
come to a head in January. Those
outside of the organization still fes-
ter in the introductory and rehash
stages, though several NCAA types
predict lawsuits if one state is
required to uphold laws contradict-
ing the NCAA’s.

One of the better perspectives of

where compensation stands, and

whether it will walk or collapse, is
provided by S. David Berst, NCAA
director of enforcement.

“That’s a concept I don’t accept
because of what I think athletic pro-
grams are for and that participants
get an education and become pro-
ductive in society. I believe that,
based on the statistics,” Berst said.

“There will only be 1 percent ‘of
student-athletes who will continue
on with their careers in pro ball.
People say ‘Look how many pros
there are.’ Then look how miserably
we fail as a farm system. The sooner
we get that across, the more quickly
we change the attitude. That's what
the hope is.”
