Annual Student Chest Campaign
To Begin Wednesday With
300 .Pa_rticipating

Expect A $1 Per Student

   

Further organization of committees
for the second annual Student Chest
drive to begin next Wednesclayr was
announced by Homer Wadsworth,
C35, president of YMCA and campaign
chairman.

The drive, a University effort to aid
the Community Fund, will open oili-
cially with a luncheon for workers in
Memorial hall next Vvednesday at
12:30 o’clock. There will be a charge
of 25 cents for lunch_

New divisional chairmen announced

are: School of Business Administra-
tion, Seymour Evans, 35; School of
Law, Dr. Judson Crane, secretary;

School of Pharmacy, Dr. Louis Saal-;
School of Engineer~'

bach, registrar;
ing, I1. J. Shumaker, 35; School of
Medicine, Jack Kurtz, 37; women’s
fraternities, lV.l.argaret Lehm, Ed35.
Approximately 300 workers are ex-
pected to take part in the drive un-
der the direction of divisional chair-
men and assistants. This is a deﬁ-

nite change in policy from last year]

when solicitation was carried on
through smaller committees. Frater-
nities and other organizations will
make contributions through class di-
visions instead of in a group as last
year_

Students attending the luncheon
will be given permits excusing them
from class, according to information
received from Mrs. Mildred E. -Stege-
man, secretary to the Chancellor.

“A dollar per student” is the aim of
the drive, Wadsworth said. “Those
who can should give more.
should not rely on parent contribu-
tions to the Community Fund as evi-
dence of their support. Their contri-
butions should be regarded as an item
in their personal budget and not be
charged to expenses.”

Funds received in the Student
Chest are to be divided among the
Community Fund, Student Loan,
YWCA a4ndiPitt-in-China, The YMCA
receives support through the Commu-

' nity Fund.

The faculty is not included in the
Student Chest. Their contributions
are to be made through the Commu-
nity Fund.

Headquarters of the drive will be
in Room 7 of the Y hut.

Pledge ca.rds and posters for the
drive will appear on the campus M011‘
day morning.

‘Players; Will Use
1850 Stage Sets

Scenery For “Fashion” Inspired
By Old Broadway Theater

 

 

When the curtain rises on the ﬁrst
Pitt Players production of the year
on November 14, it will show a strange
scenery set to the audience in the
YM-YWHA auditorium, Belleﬁeld
avenue.

In reproducing the old ﬁve-act
comedy, “Fashion; Or Life In New
York,” Carl B. Cass, director of Pitt
Players, has secured a set of scenery
changes done in ‘the -style of the
Broadway theater of 1850,

Mantles, draperies, bird cages, and
chairs are painted on a ﬂat back-
ground. Even in the elaborate con-
servatory scene, the ferns and ﬂow-
ers are painted on the wall, with the
exception of one crepe-paper ﬂower
which is pinned on the scenery in or-
der that the heroine may pluck it in
the course of the act.

Entrances and exits will be made
through the wings instead of through
doors in the scenery, the one door in
the set being painted on the back-
ground. Although plans have not
been made certain, a false proscenium
in the ornate style of cup-ids and
roses may be used to frame the stage.

In keeping with the scenery, direct-
ing and costuming of the play, the
programs will be in the form of old
time opera house handbills, contain-
ing one-line descriptions of each char-
acter.

Thompson, Crane Guests

At Dinner Of Law Alumni

A_ M. Thompson, dean of the Uni-
versity Law School and Dr. Judson
A. Crane, secretary of the Law School,
were guests at a dinner given by the
Alumni Association of Pennsylvania
Law schools. Dean Thompson and Dr.
Crane presented to this body a por-
trait of Dr. William Graper Linn, a
former dean of the University Law
School and now director of the Amer-
ican Law Institute.

Graduation Applications _

Applications for February gradua-
tlon should be ﬁled not later than
December 1, 1934 in the office of the
deans of the respective schools: Col
lege, Room 205, State hall; Engineer-
ing, Room 104, Thaw hall; Mines,

Students ,

H At Law
You ‘Would Succeed,
Try Your.Hancl At Math

According to Dr. Judson A.
Crane, secretary of the Univer-
sity School of Law, students who
have taken mathematics and sci-
entific courses prior to their en-
try to law school, are more like-
ly to succeed in the course.

‘Dr. Crane explained that law
subjects must be treated as ac-
curately and precisely as any
mathematical problems. A scien-
tific course usually trains the
student for this type of work.

Dr. Crane also noted that science
students have a better capacity
for doing daily home assignments,
and therefore can adapt them-
selves more quickly and easily to
a law school curriculum.

“I can not help but be enthusiastic
since the meeting over the potentiali-
ties of the organization, Seidle stat-
ed. “All the factionalism and polit-
ical strife which led to the dis-
bandment of Interfraternity council
last May was conspicuously absent,
and the 13 presidents impressed me as
being sincere in a desire to work as a
unit for the good of the council.”

GOP At Inquiry’

,Fa.vo-rable Remarks On New Deal
Applauded By Forum

 

“Republicans stand brazenly for
government on behalf of intrenched
wealth, while Democrats advocate the
best interests of the masses.”

Thus Congressman Henry Ellen-
bogen ch‘aracterized political admin-
istration under Republican and Demo-
cratic parties before the Inquiry
forum Wednesday.

Mr. Ellenbogen discussed the New
Deal, the merits of each party and old
age pension laws. His remarks were
heartily applauded.

Mr. Ellenbogen explained the un-
derlying philosophy of the present ad-
ministration as one which emphasizes

human and individual rights as
against property rights. The action
of President Roosevelt when the

banking structure was in collapse,
the I congressman believes‘ prevented I
the whole economic structure from be-
ing wiped out.

He indicated the desirability of old
age pensions, asserting that old age
pensions were “absolutely essential.”
He added, “The specialization of labor
and speeding up of industry has done
away with the need for the older,
more experienced workman. The
numtber of these_cases and their de-
pendents has increased tremendously
during the last few years. The best
way to take care of them is through
old age pensions.”

Mr. Ellenbogen ctassified the United
States as “far behind” the rest of the
world in social legislation, He calls
it the only large industrial nation in
the world not having this type of re-
lief.

Commenting on the attitude of the
Republicanparty toward social legis-
lation, Ellenbogen said:

“The Republicans do not advocate
the type of relief such as old age pen-
sions and abolition of child and sweat
shop labor. Their child labor law
which they hdvertise permits chil-
dren under 16 to work 54 hours a
week. Such laws are passed to fool
the public and have no teeth.”

Partner For Hop

Ferde Grofe To Provide Music
For Soph I-Iop Next Week

Miss Ruth L. ‘Solomon, a sophomore
at Lake Forest College for Girls, Lake
Forest, Illinois, ha.s been invited by.
Stanley Rogaliner, C37, chairman of
the Soph Hop, to lead the grand ma.rch
at the annual formal affair next Friday
night at the Urban room in the Hotel
William Penn. The march will start
at 11 o’clock.

Miss Solomon, who lives in VVilmet—
te, suburb of "Chicago, was president

staff of the yearbook, and hostess at
the Lake Forest Prom, the outstanding
social function of the college.

The dance, scheduled from 10 to 2
o’clock. will feature the music of Ferde
Grofe, nationally known bandleader,
and his equally famous 13-piece or-
chestra. Grofe, former arranger for
Paul Whiteman. has also directed the
musical presentations from Radio City
and has played on the Philip Morris
cigarette program. Now playing at
the Book Cadillac hotel in Detroit, he
will make a stopover here before go-
ing on to Cincinnati, where he will
play at the Netherland Plaza until
January.

-Grofe is the composer of such noted
pieces as the “Grand Canyon” and
“Mississippi” suites, “Tabloid,” and
“Blue Music.”

Tickets have been on sale since
Monday at $3 per couple and can be
bought from all committee members,
Miss Mary Milburn, William Daufen-

Shave been with visions of Mike Sebas-

tian,_Bobby Hogan, and Ted Dailey
dancing through their heads that the
Irish opened their eyes upon the
Pittsburgh scenery. Those three fel-

nlows had a. lot to do with a little un-

pleasantness which greeted the South
Benders the last time Pitt played host
to them.

It has, in fact, been two years since
the Pittsburgh trip has brought any-
thing but grief to the Fighting Irish.
Two years in a row they have come
and gone with nothing to take away
in their bags but portions of the
grime and soot which Pittsburgh dish-
es out impartially to all her visitors.
Pitt. spoiled the 1932 visit, 12-0, and
Tech ruined the one of last year, 7-0.
This year the story may be different,
according to some reports. Other re-
ports classify it as the sa.me old story.

The Panthers are throwing a whole
lot 011 the ﬁre. Victories over Wash-
ington and Jefferson, West Virginia,
and Southern California cannot he
laughed off on account of the 13-7 loss
to Minnesota and a victory over the
Irish tomorrow would certain‘y enable
the Pitts to hold heads and chins
high when championship teams are
being‘ discussed. A reverse wouldn’t
help at all.

‘Notre Dame could readily use a
victory tomorrow as a gigantic retrac-
mg step along the highway to foot-
ball glory. The Irish were left at the
post when the football race began this
fall but have picked up enough speed
to W111 going away in all other con-
tests. Included in the list of the van-
quished are such outﬁts as Purdue,
Carnegie Tech, and VVisconsin.

The Irish squad which pulled into
the city this morning is considerably
different from the ones Pittsburgh has
known in the pa.st several years. Gone
are Moose Krause, Nick Lukats. Ray
Brancheau, Hugh Devore, and Steve.
Banas, names which rolled off the
tongue of every football-wise fan in

their places are fellows named Don

Panthers Battle Irish
In__S_t_adium Tomorrow

Sutherland, Layden
Teams Primed

(Continued From Page One.)
Vairo, Andy Pilney, and Bill Shake-
speare to headline the Notre Dame
party.

Another diﬁerence is the presence
of Elmer Layden as head coach for

Notre Dame. Words written in Lay-
den’s behalf are but lost on a. Pitts-
burgh audience which has come to
think of Layden and Duquesne as
synonymous. Returning to his Alma
Mater to take up the post vacated by
Hunk Anderson after the disastrous
1933 season, Layden has begun work
with the Irish from the ground up in
the thorough and painstaking manner
of the late Knute Rockne.

Each week there ha.ve appeared bet-
ter results. What an array of talent
is at Layden’s disposal cannot yet be
determined. due to the wholesale
shifting he has done with his lineups
in the ﬁrst four games of the season.
The team which started the ba.ttle
with VVisco1isin last week appears to
be Layden’s top-notch eleven and will
likely start the game tomorrow, with
the exception that Pilney will be in
at left halfback in place of Shake-
speare. »
Spears Lauds Irish

Coa.ch Doc Spears, of VVisconsin,
went on record as saying after his
team suffered a 19-0 defeat last week
that Notre Dame had the best team
he has ever seen. Although it has
been stated that perhaps the Hobart
college team might appear formidable
to Mr. Spears after having to look
at some of the material he has had at
Madison lately, it is highly probable
that Mr. Spears was not t.alking very
much through his hat. Just how re-
juvenated the rejuvenated Irish are is
a question which will have to Wait
some twenty hours for an answer.

A glance at the records shows that
either the South Benders have been
stacking up against teams with pret-
ty weak attacks or that the Notre
Dame defensiveioperations are consid-
erably more successful than those of
the Panthers. To date the Irish have
been scored on twice, once by Texas
and once by Purdue. Pitt has been
scored on by everybody on the sched-
ule with the exception of Westmins-
ter, an outﬁt very easily excepted.

Five touchdowns, in all, have been
written on the books against the Pan-
thers in comparison to the two for the
Irish. The South Benders, however,
have appeared in one less game than
have the Pitts. Whatever the ﬁgures
mean it is hard to tell. ,

Pitt Starts Same Line

Pitt’s lineup for the Homecoming
fray will be the same as the one
which started aga.inst Minnesota, with
the exception that Verne Baxter will
be back at his old right-end post.
Coach Sutherland has been holding
long practice sessions all week in an
effort to build up defenses against the
Irish plays which scout Bill Kern has
been able to spot. The Pitt attack
has likewise been given a thorough
brushing up. Pitt’s passing attack,
which has not yet hit on all cylinders
this season, may be about due for
some success. This should be partic-
ularly welcome if the Notre Dame line
turns out to be the kind that reveals
why Irish eyes are smiling.

Besides being the big event on the
Homecoming program, the game will
mark the 25th year of athletic rela-
tions between Pitt and Notre Dame.
In football contests the record for
the two schools stands in favor of
the Irish. They have won four games
while the Panthers have copped two.
Another game ended in a tie.

Irish to B-e Heavier

A clieck-up on statistics reveals
that Pitt will be considerably out-
weighed by the Laydenmen. Notre
Dame’s probable starting line aver-
ages 191 pounds while the Pitt for-
ward wall averages up to 181 pounds.
A difference of nine pounds is evident,
in the backﬁeld averages, Pitt’s beingl
177 pounds and Notre Daine’s, 186
pounds.

The weight disadvantage won't be
anything new to the Panthers. After
milling around with the giants of
Southern California and Minnesota,
Sutherland’s men wouldn’t be sur-
prised at the sight of anything less’
than eleven Carneras bumping their
skulls together in the first huddle of
the game.

Freshman , Eleven
Plays WVa Frosh

Anxious to begin another winning
streak after losing their ﬁrst game
to Kiski last Saturday, the Panther
freshman football team meets the
West Virginia frosh team at Morgan-
town this afternoon.

According to reports and past rec-
ords the little Panthers will just about
have as much as they are capable of
handling. The Mountaineer yearlings
are said to have one of the best fresh-
man teams they have had in recent
years. Thus far, the VVest Virginia
fresh have not been defeated, tramp-
ling over their opponents in their
games in no uncertain manner. The
Panther freshman team has won one
game and lost one, winning from the
Tech plebes, 12-0, and being upset by
Kiski, 13-0.

The Pitt freshman squad will leave
by bus early Friday morning for the
game, returning home la.te that eve-
ning.

Coach Olson To Start 21 Men
Over Schenley Park Course
In Junior AMA ._Meet

 

 

Coach John D. Nicholson and his
undefeated Notre Dame cross-country
team arrived in Pittsburgh this morn-
ing, along with the Irish gridders, for
a dual meet with Coach Carl Olson's
Panther harriers tomorrow morning.
Starting at 11 o'clock the teams will
run over the three and three-quarter
mile course in Schenley park.

. VVagenhouser, Kirkpatrick, Albright,
Musico, Tost, Howe, and Great will
represent Pitt in the meet.

In the Junior AMA championships
which start at 10 o'clock Coach 01-
son plans to enter a squad of 21 run-
ners. This number includes both
junior varsity and freshman teams.
Those who will compete for the
junior crown are: Kopp, J. Albright,
Connelly, Loncher, McDonald, Howe,
Leggin, Montroll, Prosnik, \Valmsley,
Enieiis, Horvath, Nordstrom, Tlieri-
ault, Kishpaugh, T_urchik, McConnell,

Cross- Country Team Meets Harriers

Tomorrow Morning

Crawford, Cummings, and Haller.

The course layout for both events
is the same, It starts at the foot of
Flagstaff hill from which point the
runners follow a. path to the top of
the hill. They cross the road by the
Westinghouse memorial on to a bridal
path which is followed downhill to
the lake. From there, the course
heads toward the merry-go-round
where it makes another zig-zag turn
taking the racers in the direction of
the golf course. Over the fairways,
back to Flagstaﬁ hill, and then down
to the starting mark, the hill-and-
dalers ﬁnish the rough grind.

Last Tuesday afternoon the fresh-

man team defeated Langley, 25-30, at
Schenley park with Theriault of the
Cubs taking ﬁrst honors. His time
for the twoand one-half mile course
was 14 minutes, 26 seconds.

The rest of the ﬁeld ﬁnished as fol-
lows: Thompson, Langley, second;
Turchik, Pitt, third; Kishpaugh, Pitt,

Pitt News Statistician
Computes Varsity
‘Dimensions’

Last week the laborers working on
the Cathedral hoisted eight two-ton
stones into place on the peak of the
tower. This job was only twice as
difficult as would be the task of lift-
ing the Panther football squad to a
similar height. The total weight of
the squad is 8736 pounds, a mere four
and one-half tons.

John Valenti -is credited with the
weight honors, tipping the scales at
245, and Marwood Stark is the light-
est man, weighing 155 pounds. The
aV€I‘3-ge weight of the squad is 178
pounds. ,

Shotwell, Valenti, and Sites take
the laurels for height, each standing
six feet, two inches in his bare feet.
If the _full squad of 49 football men
was laid end to end, tackle to tackle,
etc., the layout would extend over
one-quarter of the distance through
the Liberty Tunnels. The average
height is ﬁve feet, 11 inches.

Although the average Pitt football
player last year weighed two pounds
less than the one of this year, he
stood virtually the same in height.

Pitt Varsity Swimmers
Prepare For First Meet

 

Pitt’s varsity swimming team gets
its initial tryout in the Pittsburgh
Athletic association pool on Friday
night, November 16.

The entire varsity team has been
entered in three events: freestyle,
breast-stroke, and diving.

A deﬁnite lack of material in div-
ing is apparent in this year's squad
due to the graduation of John Carik
and Joseph Schmeiler, sure point-
winners on last year's varsity team.
Breast-stroke material is also very
scarce in this year's lineup since the
team can no longer count on Herman
Adlersberg, co-cap-tain with Jack
Hanna. last year, and Joe Schmeiler,
who could be counted on for both div-
ing and breast-stroke,

Although six weeks have elapsed
since the beginning of team practice

Ia deﬁnite lineup has not been estab-

llished by Coach Corr and any upper
classman or freshman is invited to
try out at Trees Pool. James Bal-
lantyne, varsity manager, issues a
call for freshman managers. Anyone
interested should see him at the regu-
lar team practice at 5 o'clock at the
pool.

Miss Amos To

Open Series

Of Lectures At Madison

Dean To Address Education
Leaders On Su bje c t,
‘Significant Living’

By Charlotte Atwell

“There is only one ﬁne art, the ﬁne
art of excellent living. All others are
but means for the perfection of the
art of living.”

Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of
women, will elaborate this point be-
fore a group of combined student or-
ganizations at the University of Wis-
consin Sunday_ Miss Amos will be
the first speaker in a course at Madi-
son on “Signiﬁcant living,” a series
of lectures to be given by outside
speakers,

Her speech will develop the theory
that “Existence is given; life is man’s
own free creation," as expounded by
Gentile. She will ask, “If life is man’s

own free creation, can he help in per-
fecting his life if he knows the mean-
ing of art and how a work of art
comes to be?”

Miss Amos believes that man does
not stand still, but that he is contin-
ually reﬁning or degrading himself.
Therefore, he should strive to better
himself, for he portrays through him-
self to others his concept of what he
thinks an excellent human being is.

“Man is eager to work on every-
thing but his own life, and if all men
sought to perfect the art of living as
Velasquez, Da Vinci, and Michael-
angelo attempted to perfect their
speciﬁc arts, we should have heaven.”

Miss Amos has conducted a similar
course for seniors at the University
for several years. A conception of the
art of living is also the general aim of
the college orientation course given
to freshman women under her super-
vision.

Today, Miss Amos will address the
Minnesota State Teachers association
at Minneapolis, a group of personnel
workers, deans of women, and princi-
pals of high and preparatory schools,
on the subject of personnel work in
high schools and colleges.

Tomorrow she will speak before a
group of the Iowa State Teachers as-
sociation at Des Moines on pertinent
phases of personnel work,

At these assemblies, the human side
of personnel work will be emphasized.
Miss Amos expresses the belief that
there can never be true personnel
work in colleges until every instructor
is more concerned with teaching the
individual than with teaching subject
matter. “The idea that persons
specially employed to work with the
individuals can do this independent
of 0-thers is fallacious. Personnel
wor-kers should join forces with those
teachers who seek to restore individ-
ualization in education," she main-
tains.

Activities Group To Aid

dent in the activity in which she is
