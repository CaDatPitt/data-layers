“All To The Point” Greeted
Downtown As Sparkling,
Well-Rounded Production

 

By Israel Goldberg
The Shriners, members of the Civic Club of Allegheny county,
‘Pittsburgh’s social set and even a group of unemployed, have already

seen Cap and Gown’s twenty-sixth show, “All to the Point.”

night begins your chance.
Go.

To-

At the Nixon all this Week, the “romance of early Pittsburgh,”
as the ballyhoo has it, is a well-rounded, sparkling evening of enter-

tainmenttthat has ‘just two dull spots:

(by acutal count.) Through chorus
numbers, dances and plain foolishness
you will sit back and enjoy yourself.
Or maybe you'll sit forward and en-
joy yourself. It's good.

To say tha “All to the Point,” in
this year of doldrums, is an ambitious,
elaborate production simply won’t do
justice to Bill Marlatt and his _per-
spiring charges. Unassuming in its
theme and plot, the effort is nothing
less than excellent in staging, scenic
effects and costuming. And the acting
isn't half bad, ei_ther.

The setting, of course, is Pittsburgh
in 1789. Each of the seven scenes em-
phasizes the colonial atmosphere and
such remarks as “I’m so glad to be
out of the smoke and dust of Phila-
delphia," accentuate Author G. Nor-
man ‘Reis’ idea of a village at the
forks of the Ohio. At times the “his-
torical effect" is forced, but it is main-
ly subordinated to a lively, purely ﬁc-
titious plot.

One runs into the usual difficulties
in choosing outstanding players. Yet
the choice rests between Russell Con-
nolly, as the pretty heroine, Melissa
Marbury, and Carl Swartz, Jr., playing‘
Hugh Henry Brackenridge, the found-
er of ..the ...Pittsburgh .Academy.

Connelly is perfectly made up and
only a slight imperfection in his speak-
ing voice mars an excellent character-
ization. Swartz lends to the role of
Judge Brackenridge the maturity and
dignity it requires. In a minor part,
Marshall Baker stands out as Jennie,
9. friend of the heroine, and acts the
coquette most appealingly.

Norman Wolken, playing Joe Briggs,
is a typical villain, swarthy and
crafty, but he overcomes his type in
effective work, As Craig Forbes, James
Holland is an excellent contrast to
Briggs. Melissa ﬁnally chooses Forbes
and the audience cannot fail to see
why. ‘

Robert Brannigan and George M_c-
Gunnigle, better known as Bernard
Rosenson, and Joseph Tormey, are
clever comics, and John Wyeth, dress-
ing as Mrs. Pride, the school mistress,
does well with his bulky part. Other
large assignments are capably ﬁlled
by Joseph Samson and James Mc-
Cormick. Jr.

Remaining roles in the large cast
of twenty-ﬁve are taken by Raymond
McCune, A. Hubert Wagner, Robert
Haase, Richard Fisk, James P. Burns,
Howard Kleeb, Thomas McConkey,
Richard Lambie, Horace J. Hubbard,
William Moran, Joseph Lettereillo,
Allen Divers, Richard Ohl and Louis
Reizenstein.

Especial credit must be given not
only to',Marlatt, whose fourth produc-
tion at ‘Pitt this is, but also to Gus
A. Schnabel, Dr. Benjamin Levant,
John,St. Peter, Bernard Rosenson.,
Harold Levenson and Charles Textor,
who wrote the light, lilting tunes.
The lyrics, often more than satisfac-
tory, were written by Louis M. Fushan
and Stanley Goldman.

Just as a guess, you'll probably be
humming “Why Won't I Do?” “Maybe
It's Only a Dream" and “On Such a
Day,” before long. These three are
outstanding numbers in an interest-
ing score. And the dancing of Eugene
Kelly and Bill Pil1ich__ you'll also re-
call easily’ enough.

Thursday night oﬂicialdom of Pitts-
burgh, including the Mayor and coun-
cilmen, will attend. There will be
no matinees, so if you have an eve-
ning off go!

 

Social Justice Student
Branch To Meet Tonight

of German Situation”

  

The second of two speeches on
German conditions under Hitlerism
will be given before the Inquiry
Forum in 107 Alumni Hall tomorrow

Seven Additional Petitions
Filed After Extension
of Deadline

 

Approve All Candidates

Thirty-nine candidates will seek
election to the ﬁfteen positions open
in Student ‘Council and the College
Association when students in six un-
dergraduate schools go to the polls
Friday. Seven additional candidates
ﬁled petitions» following extension of
the petitioning deadline last week,

Thirty-four students had presented
petitions at 5 o’clock last Wednesday
when nominations were originally to
have closed. Extension of the dead-
line from Wednesday to 5 o'clock
Friday came after the discovery of
the ineligibility of two candidates, one
each from the Schools of Mines and
Education. ’ - ,

Petitions with signatures of students
from another class or school than that
of the candidates were declared in or-
der by Reed Rose, president of Stu-
dent Council, and Theodore W. Bid-
dle, assistant to the dean of men.
Two types of petitions were in cir-
culation, they said, with only one
type deﬁnitely stating that the peti-
tions must be signed by students of
the same school as the candidates.

This variety...»of= petitions and the
absence of any constitutional ruling
on the matter prevented insistence
upon strict adherence to the “same
“school” ruling, it was contended in
approving the nominees.

The question of the “same school”l
ruling was brought up by discovery
on the petition of a College nominee
the signature of a student in Business
Administration.

“All nominees for ofﬁcers of the
College Association must be members
of the association in order to be el-
igible for election," deﬁnitely stated
Robert Jarvis, president of the Col-
lege Association, when questioned as
to the eligibility of non-members of
the organization.

Jarvis said that candidates must be
members of the association at the
time of election, although not neces-
sarily so at the time of nomination.

The nominees, as approved by Mr.
Biddle and Albert Stammelbach, elec-
tions chairman, and submitted to the
News for publication, are as follows:

College, junior representative: Jules
L_ Green, Irving D. Robbins; senior
representative: Howard A. Cohen,

Complex Apparatus Used By
Students Here In Study Of Cosmic Ray

Two Pitt graduate students in
physics, Stephen Flesher and Lee
Deval, under the supervision of Dr.
Arthur Ruark, are studying the prop-
erties of the cosmic rays, those mys-
terious visitors which comes to us
from interstellar space and are con-
stantly bombarding the earth day and
night.

Much attention has been attracted
to the study of- cosmic rays by the
spectacular researches of Millikan and
Arthur Compton, who have been in-
vestigating the nature of these highly
penetrating rays.

Millikan and his collaborators have
believed until recently that these rays
are electromagnetic vibrations of the
same nature as light or X-rays, How-
ever, Compton and his world-wide
group of investigators have Shown
that cosmic rays are most probably
very fast electrons.

Where these rays come from, no

one knows. Physicists do know that
some of them are able to penetrate
as much as 600 feet of water, from
delicate measurements made far be-
low the surface of snow-fed lakes in
mountainous regions.

The complex apparatus used by
Messrs. Deval and Flesher was con-
structed by them under the super-
vision of Dr. Ruark. As there are no
plans for such cosmic ray observing
equipment it was built by these men
from obtainable literature and their
own intuition.

This apparatus consists of a detect-
ing device called a Geiger-Muller coun-
ter, which is literally able to detect
a“single cosmic ray. The counter re-
sembles a‘ radio tube in size and gen-
eral makeup. When a penetrating cos-
mic ray passes through the counter
an electrical current is caused to ﬂow
through the device for a few thou-
sandths of a second. This current is

Politics, “Irregularities”

 

Reed P. Rose, President of Stu-
dent Council:

“The reason for my calling of
a special council meeting was to
substantiate or deny the charge
of irregularities in petitions. The
official deadline for council ‘peti-
tions had becn established by
myself when, as council execu-

tive, I instructed ‘Mr. Stammel-
bach, at the previous Student
Council meeting, to begin his

work on lslpring elections. The
deadline ’desi_g_na’te.d.,by was
to be 4 p. m., Friday, Aiinil 21.
This instruction was not followed
by the elections chairman. The
Pitt News, without executive con-
ﬁrmation, as to this fact, by
Council, accepted it as the chair-
man stated it.

“It was brought out by myself
at the special meeting on Friday
that an irregularity in petitions
can only exist after the names of
the candidates have been printed
on the ballots and these ballots
Presented to the student body. It
is unfortunate that the News has
played up such a minor and tech-
nically untgger condition. The

--"error exists” in' that the word
‘irregularities’ was placed in
the headline in the News. The
word did not again appear in the
story, so it is evi-dent that the
fault lies with the author of that
headline. The entire matter, as
I review it, is of minor impor-
tance and interest to the student
body."

see how there could have been
any irregularity since we followed
our regular routine of accepting
petitions from the dean’s office
and of tu'rning them over to the
News for publication. The meet-
ing was justiﬁed in that it estab-
lished the ineligibility of the men
and placed the responsibility for
the irregularity back on the office

pliﬁer and is relayed to an automatic
recorder which makes a. permanent
record of the ray.

At present no practical application
of cosmic rays has been discovered,
but they are of great interest to those
who work on the frontier of physics,
for it has been demonstrated by An-
derson, of the California Institute of
Technology, that ,they are able to
cause transmutation of the elements,
that long-cherished dream of the al-
chemists. .

When a cosmic ray strikes an at-
omic nucleus, it shivers that nucleus
into a score of fragments.

Experiments along these lines will
undoubtedly throw much light on the
structure of the nucleus and may re-
sult in great advances in the under-
standing of the atom, which is of the
ﬂrst importance to allied sciences,
such as chemistry and biology.

Council Joins
In Drive For
Lowered Fees

Sophie Rysky Speaks for
‘ ‘Committee of ‘I-Iard-Hit
Juniors, Seniors”

 

Rose Dislikes ,Methods

 

At a stormy special meeting of Stu.
dent Council -Friday afternoon, called
by President Reed Rose “to ' take
action on the story concerning" the
coming election, which was printed in
the Pitt News” and declared open to
all students, council sought to ques-
tion representatives of the Pitt News
and establish the fact that no “irreg-
ularity" had taken place. The matter
of reduced fees for graduation, re-
ferred to Council by “The Committee
of Hard Hit Juniors and Seniors,"
was discussed, President Rose ap-
pointing a committee from council to
work on the matter,

The meeting of council was opened
to all students upon the motion of
Arthur Goldberg, Col. '33, after Frank.
l1n Kallfelz, Eng. '33, had moved to
consider the meeting a closed one.
Kallfelz had amended his motion to
read, “until after the matter of the
News’ story was considered.” The mo-
tion was defeated after Goldberg
spoke against it. '

President Rose, in his remarks be-
fore the meeting was opened to non-
members, charged the News with un-
fair treatment in its story for the
reason that “everyone recognizes that

there is nothing illegal in politics.'’'

Kallfelz then rose and moved that
council ask the News to run proof
of claims of illegal, and unethical
action on the part of the fraternities
(alleged to have joined in a coalition
to elect each other’s candidate.) The

motion of Kallfelz was stated for the"

secretary by Rose as follows:

.‘‘It was moved that Student Coun-
clt hold this special meeting as called
by the President in order to ask the
editorial staff of the Pitt News to

substantiate the charges of irregu-

larities made and inferred in today's
iPitt News—such- inferences being il.
legal and unethical action on the part
of a certain group of students for
political purposes, and that the News
substantiate and establish public

proof of the story they have printed."

The motion was passed.

At this point Goldberg rose and
stated that he could see no reason
why council should take action in ref-
erence to a matter that is strictly one
to be considered by the fraternities
involved. Goldberg's suggestion was
not considered.

Following the opening of the meet.
ing, President Rose cited his earlier
motion as the reason for calling the
meeting and declared the ﬂoor open
to any person present.

Asked by Rose to clarify the mean-
ing of the word “irregularities" used
in the headline of the News story, J.
Willia.m Theis, of the Pitt News ex-
ecutive board, replied that “irregu-
larities” referred to the certiﬁcation
of the eligibility of Charles C. Hart.
wig and Arnold Suba, both of whom
were found to be ineligible.

Walter J. Rome, assistant dean of
men, stated in answer to a query as
to the eligibility of Hartwig and Suba.
that he hadn't been able to work with
Stammelbach, chairman of elections
committee, and had turned the matter
over to Theodore W. Biddle, assistant
to the dean of men.

Mr. Biddle, called to the meeting,
stated that on Wednesday afternoon
Stammelbach had told him that both
men were eligible. Following the
certiﬁcation of these candidates by
Stammelbach, Mr. Biddle stated, the
matter of ineligibility was called to
his attention and he then personally
checked 11p on the matter. After
checking with the ofﬂcial records, in
Hartwig’s case in the office of the
dean of the School of Education, and
in Suba’s case in the ofﬁce of the
dean of the School of Mines, it was
established that both of these men
were of junior standing.

At this point Chairman Rose stated
that the News had had no right to
consider the nominations “irregular"
until the names had been printed on
ballots by council.

Contesting this point, Theis asked
where such a deﬁnition of the word
might be found, and added that the
petitions and nominations had been
certiﬁed to the" Pitt News by the
chairman of elections committee for
eligibility after the deadline for peti-
tions had been passed. Rose replied

that Stammelbach had acted beyond
his ofﬁcial capacity.

Reviewing the action of -the Pitt

Hartwig and Subs. and the action of
the ofﬁce of the dean of men in sub-
stantiating the statement, Rose de-
clared that despite this action “there
couldn’t technically have been any ir-
regularity in_the nominationf’. as he
inlterpreted the constitution of coun-
ci .

Questioned as to the responsibility
of the News to Student Council, Rose
declared that inasmuch‘ as the Pitt
News is a student newspaper it is
subject to investigation by Student
Council. This brought a. pointed query
from Irving Robbins, Col. ’35, Pitt
News staff member, who asked: _

.“_Mr. Chairman, is this to be
const'ruéd as an" attempt on the

part of council to assert a cen- .

sorship over the Pitt News? If it

is I would like to point out to”
you that the Pitt News is the of-
ﬁcial student publication of the

University of Pittsburgh and rep.

resents the student body and not

Student Council. It is no wise re-

sponsible to council for its edi.

torial: policy. I would. also like to
ask whether council is, (investigat-
ing to get at the bottom of the
matter or‘ whether it is trying to
whitewash’ the whole affair and

the’, pa"rti'es' co’nce‘rri”e'd’.” V A

‘Rose’, re'p‘lie'd: “Student Council
iscglveh‘ tl1e'right‘__by.t,he Univer-
s_ity__t'6 be" the ofﬁcial _governing-
body of the s't'ud_e'nt‘s. _l‘ interpret
this power to apply to the Pitt

News as well as other organiza-

tions.”V_ _

Immediately following this‘, Theis
rose tosay that any members of the
staff who were present had‘ come
voluntarily and only out of courtesy,
andpthat the Pitt News expected full
courtesy from council.

The matter of the allegation that a
fraternity coalition had taken place
came up for brief consideration. Dan
W. Smith, president of Delta Tau
Delta, declared that he resented the
implications of the News story against
his fraternity and that he wanted the
News to prove its statements. Rose
overruled Smith, however, declaring
that the manner in which the article
had been written left no room for in-
vestigation.

Robert Chamberlain, Col. ’33, presi-
dent of Kappa Sigma, then said that
as far as he was concerned he knew
nothing about the whole business and
would" appreciate it if the News could
be made to tell the whole story. Gold-
berg remarked that obviously the
News could be made to do nothing of
the sort.

When it seemed that the discussion
of the subject was lagging and no
further demands were made by coun-
cil, Theis asked whether in the event
that the Pitt News official" repre-

would be dropped. Rose
that council was agreed to drop the
entire matter.

Following the discussion on the Pitt
News, Miss Sophie Rysky, Col. '34,
requested the support of

Council in action to reduce the grad-
uation fees. She pointed out the al-
leged disparity in fees between Car-
negie Tech and Pitt.

Chairman Rose commented brieﬂy
on his dislike of the mass meeting
type of action, which had been em-
ployed by the “Committee of Hard
Hit Juniors and Seniors,” then ap-
pointed a committee, consisting of
Bernard Curran, Mines ’34-; Ray Mc-
Cune, Eng, ’34, and Arthur Goldberg
to work with the committee appointed
at the mass meeting in investigating
the possibility of reducing graduation
fees. The meeting was then ad-
journed.

 

Weber Confers»
with Committee

 

The Committee of Hard--Hit Jun-
iors and Seniors, a, campus group pro-
testing the “high cost of graduation,”
augmented by three members of
Student Council, appointed by Presi-
dent Reed Rose Friday, will confer
with John Weber, business manager
of the University on"Thursday.

New petitions will be circulated in’
the various” schools of the" campus,
accordingto Alonzo Brewer, Col. ’33,
Two hundred signatures" have already
been procured on a‘ previous petition,
Brewer said.

A mass meeting in front of Thaw
Hall,» Friday at noon voted that the
graduation costs .be‘reduced to $5 for
diplomas and $1.50 for caps and
gowns. Mr. Weber informed the group
yesterday that the cost of caps and
gowns has already been reduced to
dhaﬁ sum. A '

Handicap Meet Tomorrow to
Determine Runners For
Penn Meet

Traclic Men Meet Tonight

 

Two things will hold the attention
of Coach Olson during the ﬁrst an-
nual handicap track meet scheduled
for tomorrow afternoon. The ﬁrst
will be to catch sight of some ma-
terial that has been overlooked so
far this year: the second will be to de-
termine what chances the Univer-
sity may have in competition at the
annual Penn Relays this week-end
in Philadelphia.

In determining what new material
may be lurking over the campus. Ol-
son is determined that the newcom-
ers will be given a more than equal
opportunity to compete against his
varsity men. Handicaps from ﬁve to
300 yards will be given to novice run-
ners in the dashes and longer runs,
and distances from one to ten yards
in the ﬁeld events.

The meet will begin at 3:30 o’clock
on the Stadium ﬁeld, with the open-
ing event the 100-yard dash.

With more than 3,000 entries from
500 colleges, universities, and second-
ary schools in the country, the annual
Penn Relays this week-end is to hold
the‘ sports spotlight of the week.

Very little hope is helcr out that
the Panthers share in the major
awards during the two-day track and
field regatta, Friday and Saturday at
Pliila-delphia, but Olson is pointing
his relay team of Keller, Kiger, Wat-
kins, and McDonald; Keller in the
440-yard dash and ,Bonavita and
Gongloff in the weight events.

Bill Keller set a new Templetrack
record in the 440-yard event Saturday
afternoon, making the distance in 50
seconds. Considering the softness of
the track and running conditions of
the past week, his time was a near‘
record-breaking one. Bonavita, and
Gongloff have been turning ﬁne per-
formances in the weight events, but
their own weight is handicapping‘
them in turning record performances.

This evening a track get-together
will hold the attention of the blue and
gold trackers at 8 o’clock in Trees
gym. This is the ﬁrst of a series of

three meetings for track men. Under‘,

the direction of Manager Smith, Kel-
ler, and Watkins, this evening’s social’
will be devoted to seeing motion pic-
tures taken from Olympic stars dur-
ing the Olympiad at Los Angeles last
summer. Forms of runners and weight
men will be discussed by Coach 01-
son as the pictures are thrown on the
screen. Other guests at this even-
ing's’ party will be Coach Sutherland,
Director of Athletics W. Don Harri-
son, and Director of Physical Educa-
tion John Dambach.

YMHA Ping Pong

The Student Council of YM HA
is sponsoring a ping pong
tournament for girls, under the
chairmanship of Frieda Gold-
stein during the coming month.
The tournament is open to all
college girls who wish to par-
ticipate. Those girls interested-
should give their names to Miss

may become organized and be-

Records in Meet Saturday

A Pitt track team that differed rad-
ically from past teams by its ability
to score in the track as well as in

ﬁeld events, proved itself quite
superior to the Temple‘ University
Owls at Philadelphia Saturday after-
noon, turning in a 77-58 victory.

One Temple record was shattered
and one equaled as the Panther speed-
ers ﬂashed by in their ﬁrst outdoor
appearance of the season. Bill Keller,
running strongly in the 440, was
clocked at 50 seconds for a new Tem-
ple Stadium record. In the 100-yard
dash, Mort Jacobson was timed at 9.8
seconds to equal the Temple record
and give the Pitt trackers two out-
standing performances on record.

The expected Panther superiority
in the ﬁeld events materialized, as the
Pitt ﬁeld stars swept all three places
in the hammer throw, as well as win-
ning the javelin and scoring heavily
in the shot-put and discus.

Fleming, with a victory in the
broad jump and second places in the
century and 220-yard low hurdles was

lhigh point scorer, with eleven, lead-

ing Keller, Gongloff and Guay by one
point. Bonavita, Gongloff and Guay
turned in outstanding performances
for the Panthers, helping‘ materially
to run the point total to the ﬁnal sev-
enty-seven.

Golfers Defeat Duquesne
In Opening Match Friday

The opening of the 1933 golf sea-
son at the Oakmont Country Club
proved successful as far as the Panther
golfers were concerned, the Pitt team
turning in a 4-2 victory over Du-
quesne. The match, which took place
Friday, was the ﬁrst of the local col-
legiate season.

The Pitt team, of Sekay, McKee,
Bernocy and Decker, annexed three
singles and one doubles match to give
them the margin of victory. Art
Sekay, Pitt, and Francis Totten, Du-
quesne, teamed up in the most ex-
citing match of the afternoon, the
Panther golfer winning out after an
extra hole.

In the other singles matches, Joe
Totten, Duquesne, defeated McKee,
Pitt, 4 and 3; Bernocy, Pitt, defeated
Daley, one up; Decker, Pitt, defeated
Walsh, 3 and 2. The remaining
matches were evenly divided, the Pitt
team. of Bernocy and Decker defeat-
ing Daly and Walsh, 4 and 3, and the
Duquesne team of Joe and Francis
Totten defeating Sekay and McKee by
the same score.

O’Laughlin, Ganger Battle
For First Tennis Position

 

A real battle for the number one
position seems to be in progress as
members of the varsity tennis team
make ready for the ﬁrst match of the_
season, at Bethany next Saturday.

Billy O’Laughlin and Nate Ganger,
veterans of last year’s' team, are the
battlers in question, with the out-
come in doubt at the present. Last
year O’Laughlin held down the num-
ber two position and Ganger the num-
ber three, butpast ratings mean little
this season. Whatever the ﬁnal re-
sult, the above mentioned two will
hold down the ﬁrst two positions.

Next in line to Ganger and O’Laugh-
lin, in the scramble for positions are
Gurin, Solow, Slocum and Vollmar.
The regular challenge method will be
used to determine the makeup of the
varsity team. ,

The freshman team, with its usual
large turnout, is offering plenty of
Worry to the coach and managers, as
all candidates consider themselves as
certain winners in the coming sea-
son’s matches.

A Horricl Word!

IF ANYTHING resulted from Friday afternoon’s legislative de-
bacle, it was an unavoidable loss of respect for Student Council.

Called as a special session for the purpose of interrogating the Pitt
News with regard to its published statement of “irregularities” in
the certiﬁcation of nominees for Spring elections, the meeting had
only the disquieting effect of producing an intense disgust with the
entire, procedure. . , . ..

Opening the discussion, Council expressed itself as being anxious
to have either substantiation or denial from the News of the infer-
ence of irregularities. The substantiation was forthcoming, but
Council chose to ignore it.

It seems that our governing body has an awful horror of the
word “irregularity” or its plural. There is a visible tightening of
muscles, a darkening of brows when the word is mentioned. Per-
haps that is part of the inheritance that goes with each legislative
position. Certainly, it has a special connotation for every member
of the group; and that probably because it has been the most com-
mon word in the history of our student self-government. But mere-
ly because Council associates unpleasant episodes of its past with the
word is no reason why it can no longer be used with justiﬁcation.
, Council automatically interprets “irregularity” to mean inter-
ference with the normal procedure of election, ballot box stuffing,
excessive electioneering and the like. We take “irregularity” to
mean just what it implies. “Not according to rule or established
method” is as good a deﬁnition as any. “Irregularities” is what
we said in the questioned headline, and that is what we meant.

No amount of interpretation can alter these facts: two candi-
dates for election to Student Council, certiﬁed as being eligible by
the oﬂicial chairman of elections, were found at ﬁrst glance to be
in,e,lji'gi,b_le__- by the provisions of Council’s constitution. Both men are
juniors now, and were seeking election to junior positions for next
year. Continuing their present courses of study, they will be rated
as seniors in September, and could not possibly occupy junior posi-
tions in Council. The junior rating of these men was conﬁrmed by
the deans of their schools, and their ineligibility was substantiated
by the assistant to the dean of men, Theodore W. Biddle. Both nom-
inees were then declared ineligible by the elections chairman, who
had previously certiﬁed them as to eligibility.

Two ineligible men had been oﬂicially certiﬁed as eligible. That,
to our simple way of thinking, constitutes an irregularity in the

nominations procedure. And that is what the News pointed out.
The fact that the word irritated council members seems to have been

the only reason for holding the meeting.
Council, in scrambling for some technicality of evasion, merely

picked the word with which it was most familiar.
#5 =3? zit =X= =l=

The News graciously declines the role assigned to it
in a published statement that Friday’s story represented just “the
annual Spring ﬁght between the Pitt News and members of Student
Council.”

The part played by the News in bringing to the attention of the
student body the fact that two ineligible candidates had been cer-
tiﬁed to run in Friday ’s elections was nothing more or less than the
normal job of reporting campus events. The irregularity was ﬁrst
discovered by a News staff member and called to the attention of the
responsible parties. This, as well as the publication of the informa-
tion itself, was--in no way a personal indictment of Student Council
by the Pitt News.

In setting forth what had taken place, the News made no
charges, pernicious or otherwise, against Student Council. To say

'-that the matter was a “ﬁght” between the publication and the body

of legislators is to imply that the News was airing a personal griev-

ance when it acted as an impartial organ of the students in printing
the facts they were entitled to know. Such a statement is anything

but true.

3 i-' % 1! =Il¢

One indignant and unabashed fraternity president

personallydemanded of an editorial member of the Pitt News exec-
utive board by what right the publication had “stuck its nose” into
the matter of nominations ineligibility. Such a question indicates a
peculiar type of reasoning and a distortion of ethical judgment. As
such it requires an answer. ,
_ We should like it to be known that the Pitt News, in represent-
ing the entire student body of the University rather than any one of
its organized or unorganized groups, will continue to “stick its
nose” -into  -matters which concern the welfare of University
students.

As the ofﬁcial student organ, free from any form of faculty or
student censorship‘, it reserves the right to present, impartially, a
fair account of University news, and to champion in its editorial col-
umns, at all times, the best interest of the student body it represents.

- If such a policy be not in harmony with individual interests, ,

there remains for the disgruntled minorities only the recourse of
putting up with an ethical standard they cannot understand.

HE history of last week’s events in Washington, when it is writ-
ten, will be interesting reading. _ '
istration is consciously kidding the Capitol Hill correspondents, Wed-
_nesday’s ﬂight from the gold standard was a move not immediately

For unless the Roosevelt admin-

I Two of the outstanding administration plans for the relief of
hard-pressed classes of our population were deﬁnitely measures in-

for inﬂation. The bill for the relief
duction of both principal and inter-
est, thus removing in part the claim
of overcapitalization by individuals
who had assumed obligations in the
inﬂated twenties. Obviously such a
measure, making capital reductions a.
reality, assumed a continuance of the
high priced dollar. Ha.d a cheapened
dollar been anticipated, the Home
Owners’ Loan Corporation might
never have seen thelight.
Inﬂation Unexpected

Likewise the administration's yet

indeﬁnite measure for the price ﬂixing
of agricultural commodities, while:
badly needed in principle at least for
more than a decade of farmer's de-
pression, would certainly have met
with more opposition had its mild
supporters expected the rising price
level now inevidence. . -
Looking over the Washington dis-
patches for early last week and late
the week before, I cannot ﬁnd even
a hint of an expected inﬂation pro-
gram. The big news was the approach-
ing World Economic Conference. And
while greater powers for Roosevelt
in dealing with foreign diplomats was
looked for, there was no hint of the
powerful role of “money dictator" for
him. It was easy enough for Roose-
velt to get himself into the job of
dollar manipulator, with the legisla-
tion of March 5 passed and a more or
less willing ‘Congress ready to pass
more of the same sort. Then, too,
with Herriott and MacDonald headed
west, a better bargaining position for
the President might have been ex-
pected. But apparently inﬂation was
the furthest thought from anyone’s
mind.

To his credit, it should be admitted
that Walter Lippmann did something
of an about face on the matter exactly
one- day before the Administration
did. Until recently Mr. Lippmann has
been a sincere deﬂationist. But his
point of view has changed as has that
of the Democratic leaders. ‘

World Economic Conference.

Just how this whole matter ties up
with the visits of MacDonald and
Herriot it at the time of this writing
to be determined. I suspect that
there is a bit of mighty neat interna-
tional politics involved. Certainly it
looks ﬁshy when two diplomatic rep-
resentatives set sail for an important
talk in Washington over international
trade, tariffs, and other matters which
touch on national currencies, and
then, when they are about ready to
arrive, the United States does a back-
handspring on her currency policy!
My regard for Mr. Roosevelt as a
good politician is considerably
strengthened by such tactics.

When the French representative
and the English representative sit
down to talk with Roosevelt this
week, he will be tied to no
standard. That will be a new ﬂy in
somebody’s ointment. And what the
London Daily Express has to say edi-
torially will make a hundred million
ears burn on this side of the Atlantic.
“Treachery” will be a. mild term.

For the historian of tomorrow, the
interesting point to determine will be
how much of this move by the Admin-
istration was premeditated and how
much was sudden and forced. The
World Economic Conference and its
part in the action I have already
touched on. It will certainly bear
some full development. And unless I
am guessing wrong, it was a prime
-factor. Domestic forces may have
played an ‘important part. The cur-
rency inﬂationists have formed a
strong and, at times, threatening bloc
to Administration moves. Often the
Roosevelt program has been threat-
ened by their demands, backed up by
opinion strong in the West. But in-
sistent as the inﬂationists were, they
have been forced to give way again
and again.

Congressional lnflationists

_Now they become a. bloc to be con-
sidered seriously when it is remem-
bered that their demands, heretofore
disposed of ‘because other matters
were too pressing, are suddenly heed-
ed: It is hard to believe that they
gained the strength of Samson over-
night. Week before last they were
a bloc to be delayed until things be-
gan to break for the better, and then,
of course, half their case against the
gold standard would be written off
the books. Roosevelt had them well
under hand. The popular demands
for inﬂation were being met by such
measures as the domestic allotment
plan and the "mortgage relief bill.

tended to forestall further agitation%

there has been a drive by European
nations to “take all of our gold away
from us to leave us stranded and re-
duce us to a fourth or fifth class pow-
er.” That is hard to believe, in face
of the fact that our gold standard has
been deﬁnitely to the advantage of
European nations commercially. It
is especially hard to believe in view
of the support given the American
dollar -by other governments. If
Speaker Rainey keeps on making
statements like that, he may well ex-

Just Another New Era.

On the basis of my guesses, I might
say that last week's action marks
something new in American diplom-
acy. We have seen nothing so cl_ev-

Roosevelt is being‘ said too often
right now. And I feel as guilty as
anybody. 4

An unusually appreciative audience,
{making-up in enthusiasm for any lack
in numbers, heard Prof. M. S. Rocer-
eto’s presentation of the University
Symphony Orchestra in a program of
varied classical music Thursday in the
auditorium of the Frlck Training
School.

The overture to “The Barber of
Seville," by Rossini, was judged the
most successful rendition by the or-
chestra, though the Grand March from
“Tannhauser," by Wagner, also re-
ceived much applause,

The orchestra, which sadly lacked
Woodwinds, attempted too much, gen-
eral opinion had it, in playing the
First Movement of the Unﬁnished
Symphony, by Schubert, although, con-
sidering the sizeof the organization,
the musicians acquitted themselves
nobly.

dine Gallagher, violinist; Sara. Lin-
ton, pianist; and Frank Crispen, cell-

PEP Club Enjoys
Spring Supper
On Tuesday

Sitting on the ﬂoor of Heinz House,
swaying to and fro in the dim lights,
the members of PEP sang camp songs
last Tuesday evening. The occasion
was the last discussion-dinner meet-
ing of the Physical Education Club.
The purpose of the meeting was to re-
vive interest in camping.

After a spring supper of salad, pie
and milk, prepared by Evelyn King,
'33 ; Florence Goga, '33 ; Charlotte
Mady, '33, and Anna Margaret Wet-
zel, '33, the coeds ‘sat on the ﬂoor in
a circle and conducted an informal
meeting. Miss Gladys R. Tufts, of
the Physical Education department,
announced a new physical education
project, the May Play Festival, which
will be given Saturday, May 13, for
girls from thirty city high schools.
The main speaker of the evening was
Mrs. Dorothy Jenny, from Kingsley
House. A believer in outdoor life,
Mrs, Jenny told of a. canoe trip through
New York state.

Frances Dent, 35, and Vera Kost,

-'34, taught“-’several new camp“ songs

to the PEP group and the meeting
closed after a short period of social
dancing. ,

Symphony Orchestra Well
Received In First Concert

 

ist, received such applause as to com-
pel an encore number. “Gypsy Ron-

-do, from ’Trio in G Major,’ " by Hay-

dn, was judged the most successfully
rendered, although “Llebesgarten,
Opus 34, No. 1,” by Schumann, also
was received well by the audience.

Morris Cohen, violinist, who was
featured in a solo, “Czardas,” by V.
Monti, performed admirably and was
accorded a grand ovation by the audi-
ence.

This year's concert was the ﬂrst to
be given. Next year, it is understood,
the symphony group will probably be
heard in Carnegie Music Hall.

can't think straight. He thinks
a person is safe from contagious
disease if he is intoxicated!

But no college man ever pulls
boners with a good pipe between his
teeth. There's something about a
pipe and tobacco that soothes a man,
helps him think straight. That is, of
course, if -he uses the right tobacco.
A recent in_vestiguiio7z showed Edge-
