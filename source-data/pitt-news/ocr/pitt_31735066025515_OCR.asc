Day three has rucks. rubber ducks and assaults on bunks

that fell in,” the colonel said.

I held Ms. Casey’s (Pitt News Photo
Editor) camera well above my head,
fearing her wrath should it go into the
water.

On the island I sat and dried in the
sun. I talked to the M-60 gunner until
he saw the next squad approaching the
training station. He went to hide.

The assault was similar tothe previ-
ous one I-- saw. I waded back across
with the squad. As I climbed out of the
water, I saw the colonel sitting on the

I went up to the top of the rappelling
tower. There I watched Capt. Fields and
Sgt. McKee instructing squads.

Sgt. McKee talked to the reluctant
people, explaining how safe it was. ’

“You don’t need to worry about a
thing. The ground will break your fall,”
Sgt. McKee said.

It -looked like fun, and although a
number of cadets slipped, (“Quit kissing
my tower!” Sgt. McKee would yell
down) none hit the ground. It did look
very safe. When it came my turn to do
it, I found I could not make that literal
“leapeof faith.” 0

I returned to the poncho raft station. I .
had heard the M-60 (machine gun) on
the island being tested, so apparently it
was in working order. I wanted to go
across to the island and photograph the

‘ next squad as it stormed the beach. I
asked for the most shallow place to
cross and went in.--The water came up
to my chest.

I recalled a story the colonel had told
me earlier. A platoon was crossing a
rope-bridge above a. swift river. A
female cadet lost her balance and
tipped the bridge. Everyone fell in.

V i “We searched for hours, but.we

(Editor’s note: This is the third part of
a four-part series on a weeleend spent
with Pttt’sArmy ROTC Panther e

All the training stations had started
up. Cadets were dropping in spurts
from the rappelling tower and leaning
over CPR dummies on the grass. Up in
the woods on a hill I could hear short
bursts from an M-60 machine gun on
the_grenade' assault course.

Pitt in/es commercial
merchandising deal

By Frank Porco
Staff Writer

Pitt students should expect to see a lot more material on
campus with the Pitt logo. It might even sell at a cheaper price.

The University of Pittsburgh has just signed an agreement
with Collegiate Licensing Company, an Atlanta—based ﬁrm, to
market a line of commercial products associated with the uni-
versity.

According to John DeVitto, Pitt’s assistant vice chancellor for
business, the deal with CLC could end up saving the university
a lot of money.

“The main reason we are dealing with these people is that
they have the reputation for reducing costs, reducing work and
are known on a nationwide basis,” DeVitto said. “This could
be very advantageous and cost effective for the university.”

Bill Battle, a president at CLC, said that the company can
offer Pitt a lot of advantages with regards to marketing.

“We manage licensing for over 125 colleges and universities,
many of them in the Big East,” Battle said. “Pitt is the sixth Big
East school that we now represent.”

' According to Battle, nobody else in the licensing business
has a consortium the size of their company.

“Our company is one of the biggest in the business. We
have a staff of 50 people including attorneys, accountants and

HIV infection rate remains steady

By Leon Fuksman
Staff Writer

The HIV rate is the same
today as it was eight years ago
for young gay men throughout
the tri-state area despite AIDS
awareness and the “safe sex”
campaign, according to a
recent report by the Pitt Men’s
Study.

These figures modify the
decline of new AIDS cases
among homosexuals in
Allegheny County reported by
the Allegheny County Health
Department last summer.

Guillermo Cole, public infor-
mation officer for Allegheny

County Health Department,
explained the difference
between the two studies.

“HIV is not the same as
AIDS,” Cole said. “You obvi-
ously must be infected with
the virus which leads to the
AIDS disease. The incubation
period is about 10 years.”

Between 1984 and 1985,
about 7 percent of 62 men age
18 to 22 involved in Pitt Men’s
Study were infected with HIV.
A similar trend was diagnosed
in the same age group from
1988 to 1992.

“The problem is not going
away,” said Anthony Silvestre,
a research specialist with the

Pitt Men’s Study which has
been monitoring the health of
more than 1,000 gay and
bisexual men since the early

‘ 1980s.

“I anticipate a steady and
Continuing number of gay men
being diagnosed with AIDS in
the next 10 years,” Silvestre
said. A

The Pitt Men’s Study
revealed that AIDS awareness
is increasing and young gay
men are altering their behav-
ior, but focus group discus-
sions hint that many men still
engage in risky behaviors.

Cole said homosexual men

T Odd)/’S students are
tomorrows leaders

ByHilla_ry Scott

For the Pitt News

The Emerging Leader
Organization prepares first-
year students to become
leaders through lessons in
goal-setting, decision—making,
problem—solving, creativity,
stress—management and
assertiveness. ‘

Dr. Fran Sekula, one of the
six facilitators, said that the
group’s goal is to “teach lead-

’ ership theory so it can be uti-

lized here at Pitt in the con-
text of student activities.”

In order to participate in
the group, incoming first-year

students must register before

fall classes begin and pay a
$25 fee. Also, each participat-
ing member must join one
other campus activity.

The organization, consist-
ing of 135 first-year students,
is divided into six‘ different
groups with facilitators.

The facilitator’s job is not
to lecture the students but to
put students through experi-
mental programs relating to
different leadership skills,
Sekula said.

Last week’s program
focused on improving trust-
building a.nd risk—tak,ing
skills.

Students were paired with
a person they did not know
of the opposite sex. They
were then blindfolded and
led around campus by their
partner.

“I had to wash my hands,”
Lisa Salvador said. “And walk
through a revolving door.”

Student Jim Llewellyn said
that he had to cross the road
twice.

Both students said that they
were glad to have joined the
organization, and that the
programs do work.

Sekula said that he truly
believes that, Emerging
Leaders is a success. That is,
he believes the organization
is truly helping to produce
leaders.

“Two years ago I had two
students that were elected to
Student Government Board
as sophomores. That’s an
accomplishment,” Sekula
said.

Kristin Scott, a graduate
student assistant who also
coordinates the program, said
that she believes the organi-
zation is getting better and
better.

“One hundred and thirty-
five students is much higher
than previous years,” Scott
said.

shore- in a chair. He seemed
amused.

“You better go sit in the sun
and dry off,” the Colonel said.

“Yes, sir,” I said.

Now would come my great-
est challenge. It was lunch
time. I went to find my ruck
(backpack) and my MRE (food
simulator).

There was an area with pic-
nic tables. Coolers had been
set up on one of the tables
with Kool—Aid and ice water. I I
filled my metal canteen cup
with red Kool—Aid and took my
l'l1Ck (backpack) to a vacant
table and sat down.

The outer package of my
MRE (Meal Ready to Eat) said
“pork with rice in BBQ sauce.”
Inside were individual pouches
that said the followingzfpork
with rice in BBQ sauce, apple
sauce, crackers, grape jelly and
accessory packet. I also had
been issued a separate pouch
that said “bread.”

Opening the accessory pack-
et I found the following pouch-
es and items: cocoa beverage
powder, beverage base powder
(?), toilet paper, milk caramels,

2 Chiclets, sugar, creamer, wet

naps, salt, matches, coffee and
a one-eighth ounce (glass!) bot-
tle of pepper sauce.

The apple sauce, grape jelly
and crackers were typical. The
bread looked like the two
rounded loaf-end pieces stuck
together without any slices in
the middle. If tasted like regu-
lar white bread.

The “pork with rice in BBQ
sauce” looked like vomit. But it
tasted good. Maybe if I had to
eat it a lot, I’d get tired of it,
but I liked it. The crackers,
jelly, bread, apple sauce and
pork with rice were quite fill-
ing. I felt bloated.

Iwandered up to the
grenade assault course to see
what that was about. When I
arrived, I found cadet/staff Sgt.
Angela Stone and her squad
No. 7 were going through the
course.

The squad was broken down
into sets of two people with
rubber ducks (M-16 riﬂe simu-
lators). They then went
through the coursewhich con-
sisted of:
°Crawling on your back under
cords tied to trees.

-Lifting a coil of barbed wire
and crawling under it.

-Climbing onto a rope bride
between two trees. There were
two parallel ropes — the
cadets slid their feet along the
bottom rope and held onto the
top with their hands.

-Low crawling to the rope
slide.

-Grabbing a rope loop on a
metal D-ring and sliding down
another rope tied between
trees.

-Picking up two logs and
throwing them over a second
coil of barbed wire, then run- ,
ning across the logs.

-Low crawling up to the front
of the bunker.

-Turning around a claymore

j simulator to face the bunker

simulator. (A Claymore antiper-
sonnel mine consists of a sheet
of plastic explosive covered _
with metal BBS. It fires the BB’s
in a conical pattern like a giant
shotgun shell when detonated.

I The Claymore is marked “THIS

SIDE TOWARD ENEMY” to
make sure you point it in the
right direction when you set it
up.)

-Throwing a '-grenade simulator
(a metal ball the same size and
weight as a grenade) at the
bunker simulator.

Leak  

Continued from page 1
Allegheny County Health
Department officials brought
in testing equipment to deter-
mine the clause of the sick-
ness.

“The county health depart-
ment was working with my
officers to take some»measure—
merits of carbo'n monoxide, to
look at the heating system to
try to determine what areas
we should be .looking at and
generally consulting with us to
help us solve the problem,”
Director of Pitt’_s Public Safety
Department William Brennan
said. ‘ '

Two officers from the
Allegheny County Health
Department were sent out

,immediately to investigate the

building and search for the
source of the leak. The depart-
ment could release no infor-
mation about the case yester-
day but indicated that they
would investigate any viola-
tions of the housing code such
as faulty heating systems,
Allegheny County Health

Department spokesperson
Guillermo Cole said.

"The results of our monitor-
ing showed a buildup of car-
bon monoxide in the boiler
room in the basement of the
building. We believe it went
into the rest of the building
from the heating system," Cole
said. I

According to Brennan, the
problem was traced to the
heating system.

“We have contained that
source and shut down’ the
heating system. We are re-
checking the building, room
by room, to determine that
there are no abnormal prob-
lems there. Once we do that
we will be in a better position
to determine what the next
step is,” Brennan said.

Cole said that by evening
carbon monoxide levels had
fallen to normal and the build-
ing was safe to reoccupy.

“I’m told by the university
that the students were allowed
to return to the building. But
they were told there is no heat

or hot water until the heating
system is repaired,” Cole said.

Forbes Hall residents who
arrived after the evacuation
were turned away by police.
The most common questions
asked were “When can I go
back in?” or “Can I go in to get
my text book?” They were told
to go to Lothrop Hall or to the
Office of Residence Life in
Tower C.

All 21 of the students who
were hospitalized have been

put into rooms at the Holiday

Inn at University Place at Pitt’s
expense.

“Some people were evacuat-
ed at 9 a.m., but they didn’t

get us out until [11:40l,” one of '

the hospitalized students said.
Two people passed out at 9

~ a.m. and were taken to the

hospital for tests. Two hours
later the rest of Forbes Hall,
which houses 232 Pitt stu-
dents, was evacuated, accord-
ing to some of the hospitalized
students.

age 18 to 22 were unreceptive
to AIDS education during their
adolescent years.

“There must be more effort
to educate the youth, not just
homosexuals but also hetero-
sexuals because AIDS could be
on the increase in the coming

years,”,he said. _

Silvestre noted that these
men limited their number of
partners but failed to avoid sex
without a condom.

He said homosexual men
currently account for a shrink-
ing number of all newly cited
AIDS cases while intravenous

drug users are accountable for
an alarming increase. But this
does not indicate that the epi-
demic is under control among
homosexual men.

“It’s not that gay men are
doing that much better, but
that IV drug users are doing
much, much worse,” he said.

mented cases.

DeVitto and Vice Chancellor of Student
Affairs \X/illiam Harmon said that the adminis-
tration is working out a sexual assault policy,
but added that it will be a lengthy process
because of the legal ambiguities in many cases

2 of sexual assaults.

“In some instances, you find that the victim
does not want to press charges and does not
want to report publicly,” Harmon said.

“We have been discussing it from a university
perspective,” he said. “What is our ethical and
moral role in a situation like this when you
know that a crime has been perpetrated but the
victim does not want to press charges? Can we
take action? I’m leaning in the direction that
yes, we can take some action.”

Student Government Board member Derrick
St. Clair mentioned the Interfraternity Council’s
new program, Friends Educating Against Rape,
in which students will discuss the issue with
their peers.

St. Clair also asked for advice from Harmon
about what fraternities should do about future
parties in the face of increased pressure from
the Liquor Control Board.

Harmon advised that fraternities follow the
university’s policies on parties and then cooper-
ate with any LCB officials who show up at one.

“Because as soon as youdeny access [to the
LCB agents], you’ve got a raid on your hands,”
Harmon said.

One person said she was concerned with the

V effectiveness of the administration in imple-

menting recommendations formulated by com-_
mittees brought together to study various
issues. She indicated that committee members
feel they are unheard.

“At the initial meetings [of the committees]
we hear comments like, ‘are they going to lis-
ten to us this time because we remember when
they didn’t,”’ she said. “This is a definite con-
cern.” ‘ '

O’Connor responded by explaining how
committees made up of people from all levels
within the university helped formulate a new

it budget process policy last year. He also noted

the work being done on the safety task force
recommendations.

“The quickest way to lose faith is to ask
somebody to opine long and hard on an issue
and then not pay any attention to their recom-
mendations,” O'Connor said.

Second to the economy, the next most visible issue in
this year’s presidential race is “negative” campaigning.
The media was anticipating, even before the conven-
tions began, a repeat of the 1988 campaign in which
Bush ripped Dukakis to shreds.

But apparently, the voters aren’t buying it this time

 around. The polls have shown that Bush’s numerous

<')~

t

‘ ,
~k

shots at Clinton have had little to no effect on voters’
opinions.

Negative campaigning is not a bad thing in and of
itself. It can be a way for voters to find out the weak-
nesses of each candidate from their opponent.
Unfortunately, most negative commercials are mislead-
ing. Note Bush’s commercial based on the “fact”that
Clinton raised taxes in Arkansas over 100 times in 12

E years.

The Bush camp came up with that number by count-
ing acts like lengthening the Arkansas dog’ racing sea-
son as a tax increase. If Bush used the same criteria for
himself, he would also be guilty of raising taxes over
100 times, and in only a four year period.

The voters’ tolerance for these kind of negative com-
ments is at an eight-year low. The reason is simple: The
economy. In 1988, the nation was still fairly prosperous.
Without having to worry about their wallets, voters had
time to listen to Dukakis’ mental problems, his affilia-
tion with the ACLU and his “liberal” prison vacation
policy. I

In 1992, any issue that isn’t about the economy is con-
sidered‘ irrelevant. Clinto*n’s possible extra-marital
affairs, his draft record and his tenure as governor of
Arkansas seem to have little effect on his numbers in
the polls.

And it all goes back to the economy. Generally speak-
ing, when the economy is good, the incumbent party
candidate wins. When it is bad, the incumbent loses.

A year and a half ago, Bush looked unbeatable. He
had beaten Saddam Hussein. Parades and rallies were
held celebrating the victory. Democratic candidates
were running at full speed away from nomination, and
nobody wanted to face Bush and his 80 percent
approval rating. .

Now Bill Bradley and Company wish they had stuck
it out as it becomes more and more likely that Clinton
will easily slide into the White House. Did Clinton show
particular leadership potential that he didn’t have a year
ago? No. Ishis economic plan a brilliant design that all
voters can understand? No. Is the economy faltering and
Clinton in no way responsible? Yes.

With the thousands of hours and pages spent on ana-
lyzing this election and with the battling, both with neg-
ative campaigning and self-promotion done by both
Candidates, it is interesting to think that it all comes
down to one issue — one that the president can only
affect indirectly.

Animal rights activists miss the point

We all know that going to
Pitt means being exposed to
some of the greatest things in
this city: The Original Hot Dog
Shop, Schenley Park, The
Upstage, the renowned Pitt
Medical Center —— and our
newest addition —— animal
rights activists. V

The Pitt Medical Center
always seems to catch the
attention of Pitt students and

the general public. Being one C

of the foremost transplant cen-
ters in the world, it is constant-
ly exposed to the media.

We all heard, among other
famous medical events, about
the operation that involved
transplanting a baboon liver
into a human being. It is an
operation that opened doors to
new surgeries, and that could
save millions of lives in the
near future.

Along with the medical pro-
cedures, you have undoubtedly
heard of all the opposition this
operation initiated.

Enter animal rights activists.

I have one question I’d like
you to answer: WHAT’S
WRONG WITH THESE PEO-
PLE? Here we have a group of
nutballs who have nothing bet-
ter to do than to come to the
defense of baboons.

These people parade around
in front of the hospitals waving
their banners and showing their
signs that call for the end of
“inhumane treatment” of ani-

mals.
The issue about these
activists, however, is not

whether. it was right or wrong

to use the baboon as an experi-
ment. The real issue affects
every person that might ever
face this situation in the future.
A decision has to be made on
whether the human life or the
life of the animal is more
important.

The age-old argument
ensues, who is more important,
a baboon or a human? If it

"Scoops"
Porco

were your loved one who
could not live without the help
of a transplant from a baboon,
would you consider the value
of the baboon’s life greater to
that of your loved one?

Animal rights activists believe
that an animal is entitled to the
same rights and privileges of
human beings. However,
another question stands to be
recognized. Wasthere any
other way to deal with this
problem? How could it have
been done?

The main reason the baboon
was used is because baboons
are resistant to hepatitis B -
which the patient had been suf-
fering from.

Furthermore, baboons are also
easily bred in captivity, which
means they do not stand the
chance of becoming an endan-
gered species.

The use of the baboon liver
in the operation was a great

medical contribution. It was-

through the use of the

was able to live longer
than. was expected. When
the patient did die, it was
due to an “intracranial hemor-
rhage.”

Medical history was made. If
using animal organs helps save
millions of human lives in the
future, then why not?

The killing of a baboon to
save a human beings ‘life may
seem trivial to argue about, but
it is a decision that may some
day affect you or someone
close to you.

- We're talking about the
health of millions of human
beings. While one should
respect animals, when it comes

to “us vs. them,” there has to .

be a trade-off.

They can help save a lot of
human lives. Activists should.
wake up and realize the poten-
tial future that we as human

beings have because of this «

one operation. And they
should act wher.e they are
needed most —— puppy farms,
circuses, etc. In other words,
where animals are harmed
needlessly.

But this was hardly needless.
When the opportunity arises,
a baboon-to-human liver trans-
plant operation should serious-
ly be considered.

The future can look better for
all humans if we simply see
this experiment for what it is,
an advancement for human life

and not the murder of a

baboon.

Unthinkin' Finkin and his Republican views just plain crazy

Apparently Nat Finkin (“Democratic
Politics Inherently Racist”) was serious.
Angered by “naive high school children”
who , mistakenly believed
Republicans were racist, he actually
tried to convince us, from the learned
depths of his just-completed—the—fresh-
man—year wisdom that the high school-
ers had it all wrong. It’s not the
Republican Party that is racist, claims
Mr. Finkin, but the Democrats.

Soon I suppose he will also be telling
us that Democrats favor the wealthy,
discriminate against women and are
inept at domestic policy. To his credit
though, his criticism was timely.
Election years have always been a well-
spring for illogical and empty rhetoric.

' I don’t need to discuss Republican
racism and discrimination. The Reagan-
Bush record speaks more eloquently
than I ever could. Like his Republican
contemporaries, however, Mr. Finkin
shoots himself in the foot with pseudo-
logic. . '

His view of the welfare system is one
where “inferior” races are rewarded for
siphoning off free money from the gov-

‘ ernment in exchange for having more

children. This, Mr. Finkin claims, “pun—
ishes responsibility and success.”
Looking at the welfare system through
this prism somehow leads to the con-

clusion that the Democrats are guilty of

racism because they View the welfare

system in the same sweeping racist gen-

eralizations that Mr. Finkin espouses.
The Democrats are racist because

they espouse Mr. Finkin’s racist views of

welfare. This is circular logic at best,
and reprehensible. I would hope that
intelligent members of either party do

 ..not.see the welfare system in such over-
 simplified terms. Any reasonable voter

can see that the problems of such an
entrenched program cannot be reduced

— , to a petty us—vs.—them analysis.

Both Clinton and Bush understand the
need for changeand propose welfare
reforms in their plans. They both sup-
port a reform which would eliminate
welfare for those who are able-bodied
and can work. However, Bush has con-

. sistently cut direct assistance programs,

which Mr. Finkin claims is proof of
Bush’s determination to pull people out
of poverty and into employment.
Perhaps that is a nice idea in theory, but
when tax credits are taken "away from

that .

working families living below the
poverty line and the substantial increase
in jobs -is mythical, the Republican
hypocrisy collapses Mr. Finkin’s argu-
ment.

The rule of the Republican Party is at
an end, and I would hope that con-
stituents like Mr. Finkin would at least
dignify its death with an intelligent
debate on genuine issues. Claiming that
welfare is only for inferior races who do
not wish to work is juvenile, simplistic
and uninformed. Trying to pass off this

to the real world, or perhaps he simply
would benefit in shying away from such
outrageous oversimpliﬁcations.

George Long
Law School

Nat Finkin’s article about “inherently
racist” Democrats contained persuasive
and misleading information which must
be addressed. In writing about miscon-
ceptions of a friend’s classmates and
about his fraternity brothers “spewing
out” similar “nonsense,” Finkin’s posi-
tion remains unjustified. _

To exclusively blame the Democratic
Party for our country’s current dilemmas
is the same old tired rhetoric. Pointing a
finger at Clinton’s direct assistance pro-
grams doesn’t support Finkin’s blasphe-
my towards Democrats.

Abuses of the welfare system have
absolutely no comparison to the $13.5
billion debt America has right now.
Who is responsible for that, and where

did those monies go? I cringe in admit-

ting that even ,when‘Ronald Reagan was
president, our country wasn’t in such
disarray. _

George Bush’s presidential campaign
has spent hundreds of thousands of dol-
lars for one week of t.v. advertisements.
This money should be better spent on
programs which help Americans or on
improving programs that already exist,
such as the welfare system.

Choosing the lesser of evils is appar-
ently what presidential elections have
become. I am registered as an
Independent and haven’t yet decided
which of the candidates is less evil.
Finkin obviously needs further exposure

the demoralization of ideals and the
dehumanization of human life itself?
Unfortunately, yes.

Their temporary convictions are fired
by a “jump—on—the—bandwagon” philoso-
phy, which unlike most, has become a
bandwagon of hatred and apathy. We
are witnessing a resurgence of the
women’s movement in a twisted, per-
verted form. In clinging to the abortion
issue as a stronghold the liberal men
and women involved have unwittingly

1 become villains, sacrificing the beauty

and sacredness of even the weakest
form of human life.

They claim that they speak for all
women. I would wager that they repre-
sent less than half of all women, and
know that liberal men are ‘few and far
between their less demoralized
brethren. Living within a college com-
munity this is not as evident. In a real-

‘ world application, beyond the universi-
ty and left-wing media, the morals of

real America remain intact. Will the year

of the woman go down inhistoiy as the _

year of shame?

Chris Diersen
Class of ‘94

Well, most of us know about the anti-
abortion rally that happened on Fifth
Avenue recently. Many of you may also
know that about 40 pro-choicers were
screaming and singing along Fifth
Avenue to state their alternative opin-
ion. I am dismayed by the ridiculous-
ness of both groups.

Most people on the anti-abortion side
were holding signs which read

“Abortion kills children.” For the
moment let us assume that this is a true
statement. The question that immediate-
ly comes to my mind is  “Does abor-
tion kill more children than automobile
accidents?”

If this is true (which I am not sure if it
is) then there are approximately eight to
10,000 abortions being performed every
year in this country. One might say,
“Wow! That is a lot.” One might also
realize that 8,000 children starve to

death each day! So if all life is equally I

important (which I believe is a central
tenet of most anti-abortion groups),
then wouldn’t it be far more important
to fight the much vaster problem of
children starving in Asia, or Africa or
right here in America?

The pro-choicers on the other hand,
went around chanting “pro—life/ that’s a
lie/ You just want/ women to die.” How
obnoxious  I do not believe even one
of the stony, Christian faces which lined
the sides of Fifth Avenue want any
women to die.

The ideology of “no abortions under
any circumstances” might endanger
some women’s’ lives, but so does smok-
ing, guns and radon. More importantly
smoking endangers the health of more
women than illegal abortions ever did.

The life of the unborn fetus (whether
it is actually “living” or not) and the life
of the woman have become superﬁcial
to whether we feel abortion should be
kept legal. or not.

The anti-abortion groups want to legis-
late their morality just as pro-choicers
want to legislate theirs. I wish these
absurd people would dedicate them-
selves to a more beneficial activity for
all of us.

Welcome to the University of Pittsburgh. A place
that is headed for a diverse .21st century — NOT!

.While most students here are learning about abstract

concepts they forget that human beings are more
than simple theories. .

It is strangh, for me, to come across people who
think that Christopher Columbus actually discovered
“The New World.” This canbe attributed to our edu-

' cational system where they teach _Eurocentrism. That I

is to say that the majority — those of European
descent —— believe their descendants are the best.
However, the proper exposure to different
cultures will lead us to correct it. It will enable us to
objectively realize the good and bad of all cultures.
But why is there a problem when African people
want to learn about and share their culture with
everyone?
For example, there is controversy at the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill over a freestanding
Black Cultural Center. U.N.C., Chapel Hill already has

— a cultural center: one room. Although it’s more than

Pitt has, most of the faculty and students agree that it

‘ needs more space. I

However, the administration says “a freestanding
building would fuel separatism.” In my opinion, the
administration is worried that this would cause a
rebirth of the old Jim Crow laws. But the difference is
that this is not an imposed separation. The faculty
and students see this as a good chance for all mem-

bers of the university and surrounding communities "

to learn more about the culture of African people.

But who is the U.N.C. administration trying to fool?
Alienation, according to Webster’s, is the cause and

‘effect of being withdrawn. This, in turn, causes dam-

aging effects to individuals and groups.

I would like to dispute any similarities between
separatism (in its solidaristic form) and alienation.
Separation is an act of dividing and it allows time for
the healing process to begin.

For example, say a married couple has been togeth-

er for a long time. Then, for a variety of reasons, they
grow apart. Each agrees that a temporary separation
would be beneficial." _

However, here’s the problem: The person in con-
trol, i.e. the wage earner, does not want to_lose the
powerful position in that relationship. So naturally be
or she would -feel threatened about letting the other
partner gain a sense of self.

I feel as though when Africans try to help them-
selves by getting together other people are fearful.
These cultural centers are for everyone to learn, but
they will hold a special place for African students.
These places will be a haven for cultural enrichment
and togetherness. V

Alienatiori';"‘contrary to most white people’s belief, is
not a state created by separatisrn._

he University of Pittsburgh in need of black cultural center

It is a state that exists in and of itself. As an African,
it is almost impossible to feel that you are a part of
the whole body of this country because you are con—
stantly reminded that you are not. That is alienation!
— when a jury, with blatant evidence, says that four
V(7hite men are not guilty of beating one African man,
even though it is videotaped. That is alienation! When
a Korean woman is allowed to go free only with pro-
bation after a videotaped point-blank shooting of a
15-year-old African female. That is alienation! Over
600,00 African men are in prison and only-400,000 are
in college. If you do not think that we as a people
are not already alienated, then you never will!

For those who care, U.N.C.’s Black Student
Movement and Pitt’s Black Action Society do not want
people to feel unwelcome, rather they want everyone
to learn from the rich culture of African people. Also,
I would not object to a multicultural center with more
space for African people because U.N.C.’s Black
Student Movement and Pitt’s B.A.S. is working alone
and so hard for these facilities.

A cultural center would reinforce self/group-worth
and determination. One reason for all of the recent
drive-by shootings and Pitt’s poor retention rate of
African people is that African people already feel
alienated and alone. To reduce this, a support system
is needed. This would be the job of the cultural cen-
ters.

Women's tennis gets taste of its own medicine

Clarion Comesfrom behind to beat Panthers 5-4

By Tom* Schneider
Staff Writer

The shoe was on the other
foot for the Pitt women’s tennis
team yesterday as they took a
4-2 lead into the doubles round
against Clarion University, only
to get swept in three matches
and lose to the Golden Eagles,
5-4. -
Ironically, just a day earlier
they came back from being
down 4-2 to sweep the doubles
round against Carnegie Mellon
and win 5-4. '

“Things like that happen,”
head . (coach, George
Dieffanbach said. “It was as
close as it could get, and
Clarion was the better team
today.”

No. 1 singles player Julie
LoPrinzi got the ball rolling for
the Lady Panthers with a
straight set (6-4, 6-3) victory
over Clarion’s top player, Shara
Wolkomir.

First—year player Alison Baker
followed with a victory in No. 2
singles over Clarion’s Marianne

‘Martin in a three-set match that

featured a first and third set tie-
breaker.

Rick conald/ The Pitt News

After coming from behind to defeat CMU Monday, the wom- _
en's tennis team had the tables turned, losing to Clarion.

Martin battled to a tie-breaker
that Martin won 8-6. Baker
stormed back to take the sec-
ond set convincingly, six games
to two. In the third and final

set, the two fought it out into
another tie-breaker. Baker
would not be“ denied this time,
winning 7-3 to take the match

 ”“Pz'tt’;s rdisappionting loss to Terrapins

gr"!-

Tom Schneider
Staff Writer

Pitt’s 47-34 loss to Maryland on Saturday
night overshadowed a jewel of a perfor-
mance by sophomore running back Tim
Colicchio.

Colicchio had the highest single-game
yardage output by a Panther back this sea-
son, as well as the best game of his young
career, but couldn’t get what he really
wanted —' a win. *

“I don’t get pumped up about [personal]

’ stats,” Colicchio said. “Right now, we just

need to win games.” _
Colicchio followed up his 125-yard rush-

ing effort against Minnesota by gaining 156
‘yards on 22 carries (7.1 yards per carry)
‘against the Terrapins. Superb blocking by

the offensive line gave Colicchio the room
he needed to make things happen.

"‘The line is just great  there’s so much
talent there, but they’re never gonna get

7 — [the recognition] they deserve until we start

winning games,” Colicchio said.
The strength and determination of

Colicchio against the Terps were perhaps

the most impressive stat of all. It seemed as
if every time he got his hands on the ball

‘and the line gave him the slightest hole in

the defensive front, he would bust out for a
long gain. Whenever he did not get help
from the line, he would plow through and
carry a couple of defensive linemen for five
yards or more. I

During Pitt’s first series, on third and 10
at the Maryland 42-yard line, Colicchio took
the ball from‘Van Pelt and busted straight
up the gut for a 19-yard gain to keep the
drive alive. Sean Conley capped the drive

,with a 21-yard ‘field’ goal which gave Pitt
’ the early lead. Colicchio finished the first

oz/ersbadowed Coliccbios best eﬂort

quarter with 72 yards on just nine carries.
Late in the second quarter, right after
Maryland had increased its lead to 17-10,

the Panthers found themselves in a fourth-

and-one situation on the‘Maryland 14-yard
line. Instead of kicking a field goal, they
went to Colicchio, who took the ball and
ran through a sea of red shirts to afirst-
and-goal at the Maryland six. Despite this
clutch play, Pitt had to settle for a field,
goal with 16 seconds left in the half.
Colicchio finished the first half with 101
yards on 14 carries.

Colicchio continued to excel in the sec-
ond half, despite being used sparingly in
the fourth quarter. '

On Pitt’s third possession of.the second .
half,lCo1icchio took a pitch from Van Pelt
around the right end for 22 yards to the 41-
yard line of Maryland. That play set up Van
Pelt’s 41-yard scoring strike to Bill Davis
that gave Pitt a 27-24 lead. ‘

Clearly, Colicchio has performed spectac-

”ularly since the injury to Curtis.Martin in

the game against Rutgers. Lacking Martin’s
breakaway speed and quickness to the out-
side, the 5-foot 10-inch 200—pound
Colicchio must rely on his strength to pick
up the necessary yards;_

He has more than come through in that
aspect and has also shown some good
speed in the clear. .

Last week against Minnesota," Colicchio
had the first 100-plus yardage game of his ,
career and also his first ever touchdown —
a 27-yard run around the right side off a
pitch from Van Pelt.

Colicchio attributed much of his success
to Van Pelt’s confidence in his abilities.

- “Alex is the greatest,” he said. “Whenever
I need help, I can always go to him and he
See Colicchio, page 12

Pitt’s Erika Devins was back
in the lineup after missing the
previous day’s matches with a
stomach virus. She started at
No. 4' singles, where she
defeated jenny Keil in straight
sets (7-5, 6-1).

Carie Voda also won her
match in‘No. 6 singles against
Jen Simonson. After dropping
the first set 4-6, Voda won the
second set in a tie-breaker and
then took the third set to win
the match (4-6, 7-6, 6-2).

Pitt’s two losses in the singles
round were in the Nos. 3 and 5
spots. In No. 3, Marla Zielinski
was beaten soundly in straight
sets by Clarion’s Darcy Ingham
(6-0, 6-2). _ . _

In No. 5, Josie Neiswenter
was defeated by Melodi Dess in
straight sets (6-4, 6-1).

LoPrinzi had to fulﬁll an aca-

P demic requirement after her

singles match, so she was not
available to play in her usual
No. 1 doubles spot. Instead,
Baker and Zielinski teamed up
to face the Clarion duo of
_Walkomir and Ingham. They
were beaten in straight sets (6-
0, 6-2). ,
' In No. 3 doubles, Neiswenter
and Tammy’Keister lost to the

team of Martin/Simonson in
straight sets (6-2, 6-3).
Pitt’s last chance for victory

would rest in the hands of‘
Devins and Voda as they faced ’

off against Keil and Dess in No.
2 doubles. This match could
not have been closer. The first

and second sets were decided '

in tie—breakers, and the second
set needed 12 games to be
decided. ‘

Devins/Voda won the first set
in a tiebreaker but eventually
lost the match [6-7, 7-5, 7—6(8-
6)]. '

The 5-4 loss dropped Pitt to ‘

5-3 for the year. The players

will now have a few days to’

prepare themselves for this
Friday, when they compete in

the first day of the Big East"

Tournament at Seton Hall.
Dieffanbach talked about things
his team needs to improve on
for the tournament.

“We need to work on closing -
3 out points at the net in our

doubles matches,” Dieffanbach
said. ‘(Volleys, overheads and
first serves need work too.”
The Lady ‘Panthers hope to
improve on their last-place fin-

Men's tennis team's hiredgun brings
talent and pro training to Panthers

By Josh Roth

For The Pitt News

Alex Cobbald’s tennis resume is impressive.

He has played in Florida, worked at a famous
tennis school, met and even hit with profession-
al players and last year brought his talents to
Pitt.

Cobbald, a senior political science major,
transferred to Pitt from the University of Tampa
in the winter of 1991 and was forced to sit out a
year due to the transfer. But Cobbald feels that
the time off helped him adjust to tennis here at
Pitt.

“I’m actually glad I had to sit out a year,”
Cobbald said, “because it took me at least a year
to get used to playing on the artificial turf of the
Cost Center” — where the team practices and
home matches are held.

Growing up in Cape Cod, Massachusetts,
Cobbald didn’t start playing tennis seriously
until eighth grade.

“I used to be the biggest skeptic of tennis,”
Cobbald said. “I used to hate it. I didn’t think
tennis was a real sport, so I never played.”

But once he started taking lessons, he played
constantly.

“Me and my buddies used to play for three or

four hours every day after school,” Cobbald
said.
In high school, Cobbald became the number

- one player on his team and was a state semifi-

nalist in both his junior and senior years. He
wanted to play baseball in college, but when he
was offered a tennis scholarship at Tampa, he
couldn’t turn it down.

Coming from a small New England school,
Cobbald was surprised to be the No. 1 player
on the Tampa team. .

“Tennis is so huge in Florida,” Cobbald said.
“I thought I would be playing No. 5 or 6 on
their team. I was surprised to be their top sin-
gles player.” .

Cobbald found it difficult to concentrate on
his studies at Tampa — not surprising when you
consider the beautiful climate.

“Tampa is simply not an atmosphere you can
study in,” Cobbald said. So he decided to trans-
fer to Pitt,_ with the cost of the two schools
being a major factor.

Despite playing tennis and taking a full lead A

of classes, Cobbald finds time for other activi-

.ties. He can often be found playing basketball at

Trees gym.
“I like to do just about anything that involves

Brown does whatever
it takes to help team

By George Klimjs
Stt;_,{'/" Writer

When Reuben Brown came to Pitt from E.C. Glass
High School in Lynchburg, Va., as one of the top—rated
defensive lineman in the country, he didn’t expect to
make so many sacrifices.

The six-foot four-inch, 310—pound Brown did not
expect to give up his love of playing defense to move to
the offensive line — a position he has never played in
his life.

Also, Brown did not expect losing to be a major part
of his football career at Pitt.

Throughout his life, Brown has been a winner. His
high school football team, that produced former Pitt
great Keith Hamilton and current Panthers Vince
Williams and Curtis Anderson, lost only three games
while he was there and won the State Championship in
1988.

Brown is no loser, and he will do anything he can to
help his team.

“I’m going out to win at all cost,” Brown said. “If I
have to beat someone up on the field to win, I’m going
to do it.”

This is the attitude that Pitt needs. Someone who is
willing to give up everything for the benefit of the team.
Brown is a true team player.

“I’ll do anything to get on the field,” Brown said. “I
ain’t gonna sit the bench, and if playing [offensive] line
is what I got to do, than I’ll do it.”

The adjustment that Brown has made to the offensive
line is what makes him so remarkable. Although he has
never played the position in his life, he has adapted to
the college-level blocking that many great high school
prospects can never adjust to.

Probably the toughest thing to swallow for Brown is
that he feels Pitt has the talent to be a national power.

“A lot of guys aren’t playing up to their potential,”
Brown said; “We havethe talent to be one of the best
teams.

“One minute we look like the best team in the nation,”
Brown said. “Then one or two plays later we look like
the worst.” '

Brown may be referring to the Jekyll and Hyde impres-
sion Pitt seems to do every Saturday.

It must be disappointing for Brown, who turned down
perennial winners like Tennessee, Alabama and UCLA to '
come to Pitt.

“I came to Pitt because I knew Keith [Hamilton], and
[offensive line] Coach [Bill] Meyers and I had become

at Pitt, and he said ‘Man, I
remember when we
used to play Pitt and they
used to kick ass,”’ Brown
said.

“[Claytonl said that [Pitt] was

one of the hardest hitting ‘

teams he ever played in his
life.” '

“That’s why I came here,
because of all the greatness,”
Brown said.

“Pitt used to play f—k-you-
up type football, kick your
ass.

“We got to find a way to
get that mentality back.”

But Brown knows that this
year’s team can’t live off of
past success.

“Some people just want to
roll their helmets on the field,
like that’s gonna win
[the game] llnd that’s
just not gonna do it,” Brown
said.

Despite Pitt’s poor start —
2-3 — Brown isn’t afraid of
future powerhouse foes like
Notre Dame, Syracuse and
Penn State.

“I’m definitely ready to go
out and win,” Brown said of
next Saturday’s game against
the Fighting Irish.

“The fact that they’re Notre
Dame don’t mean a damn
thing to me. ‘

“No one opposite of me is
going to play harder than
me.” ,

And like past opposition’s
defensive linemen this
season, Notre Dame’s will
have to find out the hard
way.

Awards

Continued from page 9

RP’s choice — Dennis
Eckersley, Oakland
Athletics.

He won’t pull a Willie
Hernandez and grab both
trophies like the ex-Tiger
did in ‘84, but Eck must
take some hardware home
after another unreal per-
formance. He gives up a
free pass about as often as
the San Jose Sharks
win a hockey game.
Cooperstown is waiting,
but the Eck isn’t going
anywhere yet. ' ,

BG’s choice —— Roger
Clemens, Boston Red Sox.

Clemens is the best

‘ right—hander in the bigs
since Tom Seaver. He is
intimidation, personified
with his brutal combo of
monster fastball, tight-
hook and pinpoint con-
trol. Forget that the Sox
ended the season as cellar
dwellers of the AL East,
this award goes to the
best starting pitcher in
1992. Roger Clemens was
that pitcher. His line says
it all: 18-11, 2.41 ERA, 208
K’s, 11 complete games
and five shutouts. With an
ounce of run support, this
category would need no
debate, only renamed to
The Rocket Award. (p.s.
— no relievers allowed)

Manager of the Year:

BG_/RP hybrid choice -
Tony LaRussa, Oakland
Athletics. 1

With a tip of the cap to
the Brewers’ Phil Garner,

we have no choice but to
honor the leader of the
pasted—together A’s —— La
“Miracle Worker” Russa.
With Dave Henderson
hurtin’, Rickey Henderson
loafin’ and Jose Canseco
whinin’, LaRussa jostled
and juggled a band of
inconsistent vets with
newcomers to stakes the
A’s to their fourth division
title in the past five years.
He deserves a soft and
awestruck “Wooww!”

National League:

MVP: RP/BG hybrid
choice —— Barry Bonds,
Pittsburgh Pirates.

Number 24 has been the
best player in the game
for three seasons now and
will shortly silence any
murmur of criticism ‘still
lingering about his post-
season numbers. Bonds
has taken the term “com-
plete player” to a ‘totally,
new level. Bonds makes
the spectacular appear
routine. In a year where
Gary Sheffield made a
legitimate run at the triple
crown, Bonds still cannot
be denied. Despite miss-
ing 24 games, he put up
monster numbers again: 34
homers 103 ribbies, 127
walks, a .624 slugging per-
centage and the most
overlooked stat — a .311
average — fifth best in the
N.L.

Cy Young:

Another hybrid
choice —- Greg Maddux,
Chicago Cubs 4

The Cubbies didn’t meet
all the lofty expectations
in ‘92, but Maddux
sparkled. Twenty to 11,
2.18 earned run average,
199 whiffs and a league-
high 268 innings on a club
that finished six games
below the .500 mark and a
full round of golf behind
the Pirates. He’s been the '
best pitcher in the big
leagues the past six years.
His reward — a ‘92 Cy
Young and a $30 million
dollar contract. Sorry
Tommy G, Mr.‘Maddux
takes home the hardware.

Manager of the Year:

RP/BG hybrid choice -
Jim Leyland, Pittsburgh
Pirates. '

What hasn’t been said
about perhaps the greatest
manager in the history of
the Pittsburgh organiza-
tion? He’s great in the
clubhouse, great in the.
dugout and great with the
media — the man knows _
how to work it. The way
Leyland lead the Bucs to a
division crown by nine
games after losing John
Smiley and Bobby Bonilla
is nothing short of amaz-
ing. I--Iis faith in the sec-
ond-half success story
known as Jeff King was
the topper — it saved
King’s career and secured
a third straight title. Once
he wins a World Series
championship, Jimmy
Baseball will be known as
the best Bucco manager
ever. Count on it.
