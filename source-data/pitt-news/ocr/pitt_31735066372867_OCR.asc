By LINDA MILLER .

As the pool of available college
students continues to shrink dur-
ing the_ l980’s, the chances of
unethical or marginally acceptable
admissions practices becomes more
widespread. '

For this reason, the Peririsylvari-
ia Association of College Admis-
sion 'Counselors (PACACi . has
recently re—issued five “position
papers" collected, from September

1974 to November 1980 defining.

what constitutes “ethical practices
in enrollment recruitment for the
benefit of prospective students,
their parents, and high school gui-
dance personnel.

“Pitt has always believed in

without total regard to financial

admissions at Pitt. “The use of no-

need scholarship in recruitment of
academic scholars is appropriate‘

and in the long-rtni beneficial for
both the student and institution."
Porter also noted that not all aca-
demic no-need scholarships seek to
lure students to institutions which
are not necessarily educationally
appropriate for them. She said that

Sororities: Bad Preparation?

I

By CHRISTINA CLINTON

College women» whojoin sorori-
ties may be training for’living in a
world that no ltiﬁgerexists, accord-
ing t.o the results of a stt1dy_pub-
lished in the Chronicle of Higher
Ed'ucation. S

The study fonrid that the sorority
members may be handicapped in
competing for positions in today‘s
prtifessionztl job market since
many sororities emphasize the tra-
ditional female roles, usually in
upper-middle-class context.

The study was cotiducted at the
University of Washington at Seat-
tle by Barbra Risman, a'doctoral
student and sociology instructor.
The conclusions were drawn from
a three year study in which Risman
interviewed sorority members,
directly observed sorority activities
and analyzed undergitaduate pa:

pers oii the subject of sororities.

The study also found that
women who spend their college
years as "independents"ftwomen
who do not join sororities) get a
morerealistic preparation for post-
college life and may enjoy an
advantage over sorority women in —
the workforce.

But Pitt sororities are different

from those zitfotlrer‘ universities,
according to. s(_iioFity members
Pitt’s Greek advisoi.
‘ Sandy Pinkerton, president of
the Panhellenic Association and a
member of Alpha Delta Pi sorority.
said that the results of the study are
“untrue," She,sa'id that inIolv_e-
ment in a sorority helps women to
develop leadership.qualities and
deal with other people. . .

“You learn how ‘to deal with
someone who disagrees with you,"

- how

Pinkerton said. “And you learn
to develop compromises
which is good for the working
field." i V

In addition to those qualities,
she said, sorority involvement also
helps women learn practical things
like budgeting.

Aline 1-Ioffman, Kappa Kappa
(;amrna‘,; sorority member and
former external vice-president of
Panhel,‘ also disagreed with‘ the
findings in the article. She said she
has learned valuable skills in her
sorority that have prepared her for

_ a job in the working world.

She said‘ that women learn how
to manage a budget and how to
present themsel'ves ,in front of
important people. Hoffman said
that sorority members are‘ still
being stereotyped. ’ B '

As to the paper’s statement that
enticement scholarships, when
awarded as ‘‘‘academic merit”
prizes, weaken the educational
principle that aqademic achieve-
ment should be its own reward.
another Pitt associate director of
student aid and admissions, Bill
Nunn. said this pract_ice goes back
“to grade school when children
were awarded stars on the fore-
head” for excelling academically
and that it is intrinsic in the educa-
tional system. i

SA TScores  

Remain  
Stable 

By KAREN N,ElDERMEYER_, .

Average Scholastic Aptitude
Test (SAT) scores for the 1980-81
Pitt freshmen class have remained
remarkably stable and above the
national average, despite claims of
a national decline in test scores.

And, according to the Admis-

'.sions Testing Program Summary
Reports of the College Board, the
national SAT scores" from 1980 to
1981 have not shown a decline. -

For the 1980 and 1981 academic

year, Pitt freshmen SAT scores

averaged -180 verbal and 530 math.

The national average SAT scores
for the past two years were 424 ver-
bal and 466 math. -

These scores show Pitt freshman
have exceeded the national average
by 56 points on the verbal test and
64 points on themath test. ’

Betsy Pqgrter, Associate Director
of Admissionsand Student Aid at
Pitt. said, however, that the Pitt

scores quoted do not include all_

freshmen attending the University.

The average scores of Pitt fresh-
men quoted from the Admissions
Summary Reports include only

those scores of freshmen enrolled .

in day school admissions. The
scores do not include freshmen
enrolled» in special programs,
transfer students, or those enrolled
in the College of General Studies.

Average SAT scores in Pennsyl-
yania have shown a slight decline
in the past two years. The average
verbal score was 423 in 1980, com-
pared to 421 in 1981. The average

math score‘ was 163 in 1980, com--
upared to -159 in 1981. ~\,«— -~_—-/“qt-

By BARRY ZASLOFF And
MARIE GALIJK
(Editor’s note: Last ]uly Uni-

trators, forseeing inflationary
woes, "laid the foundation for a
major overhaul in university
procedures .at an academic
planning workshop in Lake-
view, West Virginia.

In a report released soon
after. Chancellor Wesley Posvar
listed demographic shifts,
wasted faculty time and the
tenure system as areas that
“demand our immediate atten-
tion."

The Pitt News solicited com-
ments from faculty and admin-
istrators on the progress and
status of some of the issues
raised at the conference.)

INFLATION

Posvar stressed the need for a
shift of funds from lower to
higher priority activitiesgand
for more efficient use of re-
sources as essential ways of
combating inflation. ‘

Irwin'SEhTilm'anf dean of the

reiterated Posvar’s concerns.

ENROLLMENT
PLAN NING ,

One idea discussed at the
workshop was the need to
reverse the nationwide trend

‘With inﬂation rising to
over 10 percent within the
and state

university,
appropriations only
allowing for a five per-
cent increase,
cut down somewhere.’

 

that has students moving from
liberal arts to pre-professional
and professional education.
Posvar reported that high costs,
and faculty recruitment prob-

‘lems may force planned reduc-

tions in professional education
where student demand is
strong.

Schulman, however, said that
“this is still a market system.
We can’t cut down enrollments
the expenses.
Com\p_i£er science is becoming

we must

our most popular program, and
although faculty recruitment
costs are high, we aren't in a
position to turn away
students.”

Schulman -did express the
need to “bring fragmented parts
together" and to “eliminate
areas of redundancy" in the
university-—particularly in
terms of class scheduling. The
general concensus from the
workshop was that more careful
planning with a realistic view
of available resources must

__begin immediately.

Bob Marshall, former CAS

_ dean and current professor of

English, disagreed with this
analysis.

“There is a conflict between
efficiency and economy,” he
said. “Sure , they can make the
system more economical, but
will the educational value sys-
tem remain the same? Large

. class sections are economical,

but the question is whether the
students have the same oppor-

tunity for a quality education. I

personally feel that, if any-
thing, class sizes need reduced.”

Another skeptic is Phil Wion,
president of the Pitt Profes-
sional Union and chairman of
the United Faculty. He agreed

that there is an imperative need
for planning ahead.

“But the administration
makes certain assumptions that
may not actually be true,” Wion
added. “They are acting on the
premise that hard times will
dictate a decline in enrollment,
when actually there may be an
increase since many students
will find it financially difficult
to go away to private schools."
FACULTY . V
PRODUQTIYITY

Also under debate is the issue
of faculty productivity. Posvar
rennrted that faculty_.time—-a
prime resource of the
university—was being exten-
sively wasted, with faculty fac-
ing “daily dilemmas" in
allocating their time among the
responsibilities of teaching,
research, advising and adminis-
trative and public service, with
unnecessary committee work
being the main culprit. The end

result, Posvar concluded, is a

factor that “compou.nds ineffi-
ciency, lifts costs and lowers
morale.” A

Wion, however, ' disagreed
with the administrative defini-
tion of productivity.

“Who is going to define pro-.

ductivity?" Wion asked. “The

engages in too much extensive
waste. What they mean is that
the faculty spends too much
time worrying about the way
that the university is being run.

“The administration wants
the faculty to just go about their
own business and give the
administration a ‘free hand‘
and trust the university. Just
trust us and don't concern your-
self with things that aren’t your
business,” Wion continued.
“It’s clear that they are using

In cooperation with the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh and the State
Correction Institution on the
North -Side, some prisoners are
finally receiving their long lost
hope of acquiring a college‘
education.

This educational program first
started in 1971 on a part-time basis,
and today it harbors an entire
realm-of majors including psychol-

, speech communications, Eng-
lish literature and economics.

The program is part of the Uni-
versity External Studies Program
(UESP).

About 177 inmates are involved
in the program. The only require-
ment to enter is a high school
diploma or GED certificate. The
first courses taken are usually basic
composition, and general math.
Classes, which are composed of
approximately 15 students,'usu__aIly
meet once a week.

The program's Pitt advisor is
Fiore Pugliano, who works on a
voluntary basis. According to Wil-
wm ‘Rocky’ Middleton, about 90

Middleton, an inmate said, “I
would like to see more instructors
getting involved. He said the main
reason instructors “get discour-
aged” about educating inmates is
that the quality of students in the
prison is not like the "typical" col-

is much slower.

of society which was taken away
when he entered the iron gates.

“The program opens our minds
to receive new thoughts, it adjusts
our character and helps us to be
worthy to go back imo society,"
Middleton said‘.

Middleton started in the pro-
gram four and'one-half years ago.

such as Highlights for Clzildren.

Middleton said he got involved
because he was “tired of fighting
the system.

“The program helps us do some-
thing constructive. We’re able to go
after something and get it.”

Sixty-five percent of those who
graduate and return to society stay
out of trouble with the law.

Two individuals, Garfield Gor-
don and William Welsh, have even
received master's degrees from the
program, according to Middleton.
On the graduate level, the inmates
must first take entrance exams,
then be appointed an advisor.
From then on, the classes are gener-
ally on a one-to-one basis rather
than on a classroom basis. Upon
re—entering society, many of these
graduates build careers, Middleton
said. .

Funding for the program is now
in trouble. Even though most
funding comes from grants and
taypayers, Community College
had to drop from the program
because there was not enough
money, he said. .

Traditional Role Empghasized

“We’re not just fluffy airheads,"
she said. “We’re very serious peo-
ple."»

Hoffman added that a large per-
centage of successful people were
formerly Greeks.

Lou McLinden, assistant direc-
tor. of student activities and Greek
advisor, said that while Risman’s
findings may be true at other
schools, he doesn’t think it applies

S to Pitt’s sorority members.

“There is a traditional sorority
‘system in the South. I’ve seen
them,” he said. “But Pitt’s system
is "not like that."
He said that former officers in
Panhel currently hold jobs outside

J of the traditional female roles. He

said Pitt's sorority system is differ-
ent because Pitt is an urban cam-
pus and most of the students are
from Western Pennslyvania.

“Pitt women are very active," he
said. “We try and tell them to never
take a back seat to anybody.'.’

iMcLinden said that because sor-
ority members are dealing with

' older people (alumni and associa- _

tions), which will be very benefi-
ciarafter graduation. ‘
“If you only ‘associate with
members of your own age group,
you're going to have a tough time
adjusting in the work force after
graduation,” he said.
The study also found that:

The Piti News,’ Wednesday, April  1982

O Sorority women generally con- .

fine their social life to parties and
dates with fraternity men.

0 The behavior of fraternity men
complements that of sorority
women. The men, for example,
make the initial request for a date
and that reinforces the sorority
women's passive role in male-
female relationships.

nhllanic President-Sandy P keron said he sorority '
, study is “untrue.” ‘

Hoffman said that in many
cases, these findings are untrue.

‘‘I don't date a fraternity member I

and many of my sisters don't
either," she said.

tional Academic Congress on

A Proud Grad

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

When she was a young girl,
Hortense James looked at the
Cathedral of Learning and
dreamed of going to Pitt some-
day. Now she is making that
dreaima reality. ‘’ i

At 58, with a daughter and
grandson also enrolled at Pitt,
James will be graduatinglater
this month with a B.A. degree
in Social Work and has already
been accepted to the Graduate
School of Social Work for the
next fall term. .

“So many older ‘people
should be back in the main-
stream," she said. “I’m sure that
there’s something out there for
everyone.”

James found that, when she
entered college in 1979, pewle
had negative feelings ab'<3'u't her
coming to school, thinking she
was doing it just to keep busy.
Now they realize how seriously
she’s taking her work.

“l have always seen a need for
social work,” James said.
“There have always been social
problems.” 

She is currently doing her
practicum as a social worker at
Lemington Home for the Aged
and fi‘r_1g_l‘sgthe work very reward-
ing. In her work, James helps

older people deal with feelings
of boredom and uselessness.

“I can give them consolation
and show them their worth,"
said James. “The elderly don't

. want to take the youngsters’

jobs, but there are so many
things they can do to prove their
worth.”

James found that her age
hasn't been much of an obstacle
so far—people are judged not
by their age but by their ability.

“At school, I’m one of the
girls,” she said.

An avid reader, James finds it
hard to pinpoint her favorite
type of reading material. ,

“I’ve read everything I can get
my hands on,” she said, adding
that she believes her education
is ,making her a more well-
round person.

James, who has three daugh-
ters, 16 grandchildren and five
great-grandchildren, finds that
her age, with the responsibility

- of raising a -family behind her,

is the perfect time to go to
college.

She graduated from Fifth
Avenue‘High School in Pitts-
burgh in June, 1941 and was
married three months later. She
began‘ raising a family
immediately.

Clark is opposed to the idea that
scholarship funds should be taken
away from those scholars who have
the means to pay for their educa-

students with limited finaiicia‘l aid

“It completely ignores the
obvious need for rewarding aca-

explained that the position paper
was written in l975—long before
he chaired the committee. “I.

myself, cannot fiill-heartedly agree‘;

with this. There’ needs to be. and

the fact that a very large portioti of

The Pitt News, Wednesday. April 7, 1982

For the first time since nearly a decade ago, when exten-
sive protests against the Vietnam War were convulsing the
nation, there are signs this spring of a renewed political
activism on college and university campuses.

. e (Excerpted from a story 
the Monday, April 5th edi-
tion, of the New ‘ York

’ ’ Times.-)

Well, that’s nice to know."A renewed political activism ‘

on college campuses; we wonder what happened to the old

activism? We do hope, however, that no one’s parents are ‘

going to yank their kids out of school because the radicals
and hippies have suddenly been let loosed‘ to wreak havoc
on the campus of All-American College. Why, Muffy and
Brad would for sure be pissed. After all, wasn't it Mummy

and Daddy, who were the radicals on college campuses , ~

during the’Vietnam War anyway?" .
Mutty and Brad are getting pissed, all right, but it's not
because of Mummy and Daddy. This time they're protest-
ing in different ways and for different reasons than during
the Vietnam War. _ ~ ’ '
In the 60‘s, college campus activists were described as

' “vocal minorities." Today, on the other hand, they're

called “valuable constituencies,” and are measured by the
volume of votes they can muster for any given politician.
In_ the 60's, campus activists spent a good amount of time
devising ways to blow up the R.O.T.C. building. Today,
they spend an equal amount of time devising ways to get
R.O.T.C. scholarships. And injthe 60’s, campus activists
discarded anything that reeked of the establishment, such
as fancy clothes, “expensive cars and other status symbols.
Today’s activists wear three-piece suits or dresses and
make appointments to lobby their electedofficials, instead
of throwing bottles through the window.

Perhaps more important than the ways students are

renewing their political activism are their reasons for
renewing the ‘activism. The reason. according to one uni-
ve_rs‘i_tyv_adini_nistrator interviewed in The Times article is
"that of self-interest, not“altruism.TVe’ll buy that argu-
ment, especially if what the administrator means by self-
interest is a natural fear of having to leave collegebefore
you graduate because your student aid has run out.

" “A lot ot students are anxious and angry because they
feel threatened.” the administrator added. “They see the
support systems for their own economic‘ opportunities
slipping away." _

Economic opportunities’aren’t the only things slipping

away ‘from students of today; they’re also losing a lot of

confidence they once had in their country and its political
processes. At one time in this country's histor-y—-a long
time ago-—'young people kept some slim hope that the
persons they elected to the presidency might be able to live
up to their expectations of putting the country on the right
track. Today, however,‘ they put a president into office
who speaks in Cold War rhetoric and appoints men who,

c after a morning prayersession, go out and prostitute the

country’s natural resources for corporate interests.

Is it any wonder that political activism is being renewed
on college campuses? No, life has been getting pretty grim
lately, especially for students. Students are recognizing the
fact that unless they tell their elected officials about the

gross disparities involved in’ raising defense spending -

while at the same time cuting aid’ for poor people-which
includes students-——they may not be students for much
longer.

Indications are, in fact, that some of the activism is
working, particularly in the? war against the admiiiistra-
tion’s proposed cuts in student aid. Two weeks ago, the
House Appropriations Committee approved an extra $l,.3
billion in emergency funds for federal student loan pro-
grams. And gradually, the “president” is realizingtliat his
popular support is slowly declining, so much so that he
has launched aslick political relations campaign aimed at
bolsteringihis faltering image. -

Yes, Muffy and Brad are pissed all right. But it’s for
different reasons this time. -

Don ’t Preclude

iLifef’s Simple

Pleasures ,
Dear Editor:

I would like to offer an opposing

I opinion in response to W. S. Mey-

er’s April 5th letter to the editor

("Mud--Wrestling a Degrading

Spectacle"). When I came to Pitt
two years ago as a seven-year

c Marine veteran, I was more than a
__‘bit apprehensive as to how well I

would be able to assimilate into
university and dormitory life. I had
assumed that along with academic
responsibilities, I would have to
adapt to a certain amount of the
zany, light-hearted fun-seeking
that normally accompanies youth.

While I found there to be a large

number of individuals who
enjoyed the pursuit of a good laugh
during their leisure, I was shocked
by the extensive proportion of the
student body that seemed crippled
with varying degrees of intellectual
spobbishness and social conserva-

tism. It_ seems that many of these .

students are’ so overly concerned
with adopting the stern, serious
image as a responsible leader of
tomorrow that they are willing to
forego the last few years of the fun
and permissiveness associated with
their youth. W.S. Meyers’ letter is
one of the saddest examples of this
debilitating attitude that I have yet
to encounter. g

First, Meyers makes ‘ a value
judgement as to the maturity, of the
two female wrestlers, “Boom
Boom" and her opponent, who are
incidently both resident directors;
and then charges them with acting

to the detriment of the women’s

liberation movement and as being
a discredit to their gender. Meyers
failsto mention that men partici-
pated in the contest to an even
greater extent than did the women.
Are they a discredit to their gender
also?

Second, he was much grieved by
the fact that students of higher
learning could find recreation in
such a mindless pursuit of happi-
ness. I suppose Meyers would prob-
ably just puke ifhe could somehow
be aware of-all the great minds over
the years that prostituted their
intellect long enough "to get a
chuckle out of the proverbial pie in

..the face. the Keystone Kops or a
three-legged sack race. Meyers then _

unfoundedly suggests that there is

a correlation between studeiits who

enjoy events such as mud wrestling
and the image of universities as
being unable to produce anything
but technical expats who are
unable to function intelligently
ziiitside of their vocational myopia.

The mud-wrestling event was

not limited to any sex or ethnic

origin. nor was it intended to

‘Lab Animals

Is Mud-Wrestling C|ean~Fun?

degrade or exploit any individual
or section of society. Rather, the
event was held in the spirit of fun.
The participants were students of
both sexes who possessed a hearty
sense of humor and the event was

largely’ attended by their friends A

who viewed and enjoyed the ‘4‘spec-

. tacle’3 in the spirit in whichit was

intended. If you start to analyze

everything that makes you laugh-

with this air of intellectual snob-
bishness, you will soon find that
you _don’t laugh much. i "

I feel that a "university is respon-

sible ‘for, the development of the.

higher faculties so as to enable one
to appreciate the finer pleasures in
life, but this should not preclude
the enjoyment of the simpler plea-.
sures also.

Dear Editor:
It is unfortunate that W.S. Mey-
ers in his April,5 letter,..“Mud-

Wrestling a. Degrading Spectacle,”
is so caughtup in “academic” bet--

. terment.” So caught up, in fact,

that he has created one of the most
incoherent run-on ‘ sentences in
recent Pitt News history. I’m refer-
ring to the senterice:

First, it seemed inconceivable to

me that twoipresumably mature

‘women '(this, of course, provedit
be a rebuttable presumption)

-would subjectthemselves to such

degradation as persons and to such

. gross exploitation as members and

_ the Quad

BeKindZTo

Dear Editor’
1 am writing this letter to protest
what I see as cruel and unusual
punishment toward, laboratory
animals on this campus. I recently
participated in a lab class where it
waslthe usual practice to kill what-
ever animal was being used after it
had been subjected to a series of
cruel, psychological experiments.
In fact in one case where white
rats were distributed to the class, I
witnessed some student actually

‘throwingthe animals out of -the

laboratory window onto the street,
where the rats were later pelted by

rocks, run over by cars, or both. I'd '

like to see how those students
would feel if they were subjected to
the same tortures: I bet they

wouldn't be laughing. '
Now, although I’ll be the first to
admit I'm all in favor of furthering
human knowledge of the ways
nature works, I'm also sympathetic
toward animals. I hope that in the
future Pitt students are a little more
aware of their actions liefore they
decide to “have a good time" and
torture some defenseless animal.-
Failing-that. I hope they see what it
feels like to get tossed out the
window. Jake .[(](:in

‘representatives of a group in our .

‘society which has worked so hard
and has made such great strides
toward extinguishing not only that
sort of degradation and exploita-
tion in fact but also the mind set
which is its_promulgator.

There has to be a better way to
say that. Then Meyers has the nerve
to accuse the university of “churn-
ing out mere technical experts who
have...i’io ability to function intel-

-ligently outside their own voca-

tional myopia?” Talk about
hypocrisy. The letter is so full of

obvious technical law-school jar-"IQ

gon that it barely communicates its
ideas. . - ,
Myers “sincerely hopes that

- undergraduate students-in this uni-

versity are being trained to occupy
their time in a manner that is more
conductive to social and academic
betterment...” Perhaps the author
should take his own advice. For
instance, instead of diligently prac-
ticing muddled, buzz-word preach-
ing, the author might learn
something useful by looking at car-
toons. In fact, the editorial cartoon
right above his letter said every-

thing Meyers tried to say with one?

picture-—and one sentence!

Or is looking at cartoons too
degrading for a member of a “fine
iiniversity?" ‘

‘Roomie’”Causes Personality Conflict;
Student GetsBurned by Bureaucracy

wt’ Editor:

I ou do not have tolook fartosee
why so many students have a nega-
tive view of life here at Pitt.
(Remember the college ratings?)
Quite often students can find, to
their dismay, incompetence and
apathy in student services just
down the hallway. ‘ ‘

I just recently encountered
“intense”_attitude and personality

conflicts with my roommate: she‘

liked the room to be 90 degrees.
while I could not breathe; she liked
late-night and early-morning
phone calls (3 and 7 a.m.) while I
ﬁed to sleep; she liked having her

I iends sleep in my bed while I was

away—I did not appreciate having
to change the sheets; she liked
using all of my things while I did
not appreciate her hair in my
refrigerator. All in all, she violated
six of the student codes of conduct
related to persons and property.
A rational discussion with her
was out of the question; her last
roommate tried this and failed,
onlyto be intimidated verbally and
emotionally to the point ofrextreme
paranoia (she feared for her life),

This literally came from the horse’s ‘

mouth; I got this gem of an anec-
dote from my “roomie" shortly
yer she moved in in January. I
i ared my problems would be
worse if I confronted her, and I

thought I could make it to the end

of the term in spite of the problems, ~

but I was wrong. The living situa-
tion became unbearable with time.

got was passed on to another. This
time I was sent to the assistant
director of the Office of Residence
Life. whotold me a completely dif-
ferent story from the RD the night
before. I was told I had to confront
my “roomie" before a room change
could be made. T heiconfrontation
with her and the RA (her friend)
did nothing but worsen the prob-
lem; my roommate told “herside of
the story," and I was made to look
like the one who had done all the
wrong. I did not go to my room the
following week at all, and I moved
off campus five days after this con-
frontation. I asked for on-campus
housing, but‘ being that I was the
one being victimized, that I had
that room for the past one and one-
half years (my last roommate left
school due to family problems) and
that she’ had roomie problems
before, I wanted her to be moved.

She refused, and housing could not

or would not move her. I was then

told by my RA that the only rooms
available for me were “Tower’s

rooms with girls who were undesir-
ables and worse than my “roomie”,

t and I would be worse off.” I was

told later by the man in charge of

‘room assignments in housing after
‘moving completely off-campus
and paying one month rent. that I
could have had a suite in Bracken-
ridge and that I had been “misled."

I also did not receive a refund for A

moving. and my roommate. now
has a single. I feel this problem
could have been dealt with better;
the people involved showed no
concern for my physical or emo-
tional welfare. They just did not
want to be botherd by the paper-
work and time involved in a room
change--regardless of the fac_tors
involved. I was tired of being led
around by the nose from one to
another and hearing different sto-
ries from each while they all

thought the problem could solve A

itself; when in reality it was hope-
less. I wonder how long this kind of

A mishandling of housing situations

has been going on and how many
more students are going to “get
shafted” as I did before some
serious positive changes are made
in the housing system.

The Pitt_News, Wednesday, April 7, 1982

 

The Braun Room, located on the twelfth floor of the Cathedral is an example of Louis

XV design in modern reproduction.

In The

“The structure is to be like a great
symphony. Forceful, unafraid, sub-
lime with a sense of upwardness, it
will start our accustomed limits of
thought and life to move farther
away. The immeasurable quantity

of its lift, buttress after buttress ris— ~

ing but never arriving in a spire, will
suggest force- enough to go still
beyond themselves, make us appre-
hend that the power to create and

  Beginning

achieve is the source of the value of
education. and%f life. The plan is a
building which shall be a fitting and
central symbol of the topmost, high-
motivated energy and reverence in
Pittsburgh. ”

John Gabbert Bowman
. Chancellor

  Special Rooms

C ronau photo

In the years following World War
II, student enrollment at Pitt had
increased dramatically from less
than 1,000 to -more than 6,000, caus-
ing a serious shortage of space. The
solution for this problem, as thought
by many, was to erect a number of
four-story buildings as quickly and‘
cheaply as possible. But John G.
Bowman, the university’s tenth
chancellor, had another idea. He
wanted to build a structure that

- would express the quality of life that

ought to be inside anyone who has

an education-. He had a plan to erect‘
a monumental building that would

expand upward, solving the univer-

sity’s growing problems of space

anddistance. He believed a tower

would be'Ta visible inspiration to

everyone in the city and would carry

the message that education was the

result of aspiring to great heights.

Close to the campus were 14
acres of land known as Frick Acres.
All traffic between the residential
East End and the downtown busi-
ness section had to pass that loca-
tion on one side or the other. A
building in the center of that area
would be a powerful symbol of edu-
cation reaching people through the
region. '

Architect Charles Z. Klauder of

Philadelphia was hired by Bowman"

‘The Darlington Library, located on the sixthiﬂoor of the Cathedral, was donated’ by the
Darlington family of LP-i-ttsburgh.

Cl/Pl/einschenkr

to translate the ideas of the building

into drawings that would lead to the ‘

building of the Cathedral of
Learning. ’

Bowman contacted corporations
and individuals and conducted a
public fund-raising campaign. The
challenge to help build a historical
landmark evoked the participation
of the Pittsburgh people. Even the
school children became involved
through the famous “Buy a Brick”
campaign. Children in the public
schools were encouraged to donate
10 cents toward the construction of
the Cathedral. ‘Each child then
wrote a letter explaining how the
dime was earned and in return
received a certificate of ownership
of a brick in the Cathedral. Because
of this campaign, 97,000 school

children made contributions to help

build this monument.

Local industries donated large
gifts of cement, steel, glass, plumb-
ing, heating materials and elevators;
17,000 individuals also made
contributions. ’

On September -27, 1926, ground‘

was broken for the Cathedral of
Learning.

The last steel rivet was driven into
the frame of the Cathedral on
October .21, 1929.

1 A Aside from its famous nationality
rooms, the Cathedralof Learning

'possesses-a number of unusual

rooms that include some interesting
features. These rooms are the Com-
mons room, the Croghan-Schenley
ballroom, the secret hiding place in
the Early American room, the Dar-
lington Library,_the Braun room and
Heinz kitchen and the Babcock
Memorial room.

The Commons room, located on
the first floor of the Cathedral “was
designed for people to meet
together,” according
Schwartz, a Quo Vadis tour guide.
The 52-foot high Gothic hall
includes arches without steel sup-
ports; the walls of the room are
-made of Indian limestone and the
floor is of green Vermont slate.

“Each of the arches is a true arch,
supported by a keystone which
holds the arch in place,” Schwartz
said.

Another room located on the first
floor of the Cathedral is the
Croghan-Schenley ballroom. “This
is the actual ballroom that came
from the William Croghan, Jr. 29-
room mansion that was situated in
Stanton Heights,” Schwartz said.

The ballroom is done in the Greek
Revival style that was popular in
Western Pennsylvania throughout
the 1830s and 18405. According to
Schwartz, the room includes a crys-
tal and bronze chandelier, a white
oak floor, satin draperies, a modular
mahogany table, Regency style arm
chairs and a white marble fireplace.

In his 1937 work The Early Archi-

to *Dan,

  The Inside

With the Depression beginning,
construction slowed down, because
necessary funding was not available.

In order to ensure the completion

of the Cathedral, Bowman had th‘é3‘*‘"“-

builders begin the stonework from
the fifth floor upward, reaching 535
feet into the sky.

In the 1930, when the stonework
reached the top, funding was
extremely low. Despite the hard
times, Pitt continued to receive

the people of Pittsburgh:

The Nationality Rooms



Many Pitt students are afforded
the unique opportunity of having
class in one of the university’s 19
Nationality rooms.

Located on the first ﬂoor of the
Cathedral of Learning, the class-
rooms contain fine wood-worked
furniture, detailed paintings and
handmade stained glass windows.

The building of the Nationality
classrooms occurred along with the
construction of the Cathedral of
Learning, under the direction of
John Gabbert Bowman, Chancellor‘

of the university in 1921. Bowman‘-‘g
wanted something special to be,

build in the Commons Room.
The idea to‘ build such rooms

  came into being one evening as
" wman spoke to a Pittsburgh com-

’.
D

munity group. Most of these people
or their parents had recently come
to America. from Europe. Having
settled here, many left behind family
and memories and struggled to
begin their lives in a new country.
Bowman spoke that night about
his raison d’etre, his reason for
being—education——the importance
of it, the quest for it and the oppor-

It

with a tour guide,” Schwartz said.

Another‘ special part of the
Cathedral of Learning is the Darling-
ton Library which is located on the
sixth floor. Savina Skewis, a univer-
sity consultant said, “It was a library
given by the Darlington family, a
family in Pittsburgh.”

The Braun room,. located on the
twelfth floor of the Cathedral, is
another unique room. According to
Skewis, Mrs. Arthur E. Braun in
1941 purchased the San Domingo
mahogany walls paneled in carved
floral designs and the French win-
dowsfrom the East End home of Mr.
Grant McCargo, which was being
torn down in’ order to make room

“wiior the gymnasium of Chatham Col-

lege. This room was a library in the
McCargo home. In 1942, Chancel-
lor Bowman suggested to Dean
Rush that this room should be used
on the 12th floor as a conference
room. In 1946, the room was dedi-
cated as the Braun room.

“The Braun room is a pure exam-
ple of Louis XV design in modern
reproduction,” Skewis said. “The
furniture is also 18th century‘French
in design and it is appropriate as well
as elegant. Blue carpeting was used
for the floor covering.

“When this carpeting needed to
be replaced in 1955, Dr. and Mrs.

$1.0 Ernst (daughter and son-in-law
of Mrs. Braun) selected a beautiful
oriental rug called ‘The Iron Rug of
Persia.’ Mrs. Ernst had always
expressed gratitude for the care and
use the University had "made of this
room as a memorial to hertmother.”

tunities available to the children of
his audience. Bowman and the com-
munity members decided to estab-
lish in the community a
representative piece of their home--
lands as a symbol of their hope for a
brighter future for their children.
Such an extraordinary idea
needed leadership and understand-
ing. For this, Bowman looked to a
young woman who was a sociology
teacher at the university. Her name
was Ruth Crawford Mitchell,
through her enthusiasm, hard work
and dedication along with the com-

- munity groups, 19 rooms were build

between 1938 and 1957.
The enthusiasm spread beyond
the bounds of Pittsburgh, across the

seas and into the mother countries ’

where groups and governments
supported the project by providing
funds, materials and artists. Most of
the designers and architects were
native-born and produced rooms of
quality and authenticity. Even
through periods of national

turmoil—the Great Depression and *

World War lI—when nations were
struggling, against each other. the

Centered in the paneling of one
wall is a low bookcase made of
grained mahogany, bordered and
topped with classic carving. Accord-
ing to Skewis, this bookcase was
made by university carpenters to
replace the original fireplace, which
would have been impractical on a
floor 12. stories above the ground.
Also, two crystal drop chandeliers
hang from the ceiling and are sup-
plemented by several lamps for ade-
quate lighting. D

Skewis, who had served as Dean
of Women, Associate Dean of Stu-
dents and Director of the Heinz

‘Memorial Chapel, was retired but
re-employed part-time to serve as
consultant to the secretary of the
university. Her responsibility
became that of keeping the Braun
room and the Heinz kitchen availa-
ble for special use. According to
Skewis, students in the Heinz
Chapel Choir, Pitt Glee Club, Quo
Vadis, Mortor Board, Lambda
Sigma and others have requested
the use of the Braun room for their
initiations, special meetings and
receptions. ,

The Heinz kitchen was donated
by Mrs. Heinz and is used for pre-
paring meals to be served at special
functions. “The meal must be for an
educational purpose,” Skewis said.
“Also, wekeep records of the food
that is used. Then, the organization
is required to pay.”

Skewis said that permission for
the use of the room is given by her
and she always serves as co-host;

members of Quo Vadis,/a volunteer
student organization, have been
conducting tours for over 20,000 vis-
itors each year. People from all over
the world come to view the authen-
tic examples of Classical, Byzan-
tine, Romanesque, Renaissance,
Tudor and Empire styles, as well as
peasant architectural designs.

Each room is a delight to visit and
a culture to experience and learn
from. Guarding the entrance--to the
Chinese room are two laughing lions»
made of stone, which represent the
Chinese people’s happy outlook on
life. In this classroom, a professor
sits at the round, teakwood “moon-
table” on the same as his students,

“Teach by inspiring; gradually and
steadily.”

In the German room, stained

scenes and quotations from the fam- .

relaxed coversation. and it should be
widely used but always. with care,”
Skewis said.
The Babcock Memorial room,

which occupies the entire 40th floor
of the Cathedral of Learning, was

dedicated on November 24, 1958 in -

memory of Edward Babcock. Ske-
wis said the room is used for impor-
tant educational meetings and
functions.

“The square shape of the Bab-
cock room is modified by four
alcoves, one of which shelters a por-
trait of Mr. Babcock,” Skewis said.
“The alcoves lead to broad windows
overlooking the university campus,
the Golden Triangle and much of
Allegheny County.”

The walls are paneled in Appa-

lachian white oakwith walnut inlays"

and touches of rosewood. the floor
is covered with blue carpeting, at
the center of which is the university
seal. The ceiling is domed, with
lights that may be dimmed or bright-
ened to suit the occasion. The table
is of Appalachian oak and may be
disassembled and rearranged into a
number of smaller groups.

Skewis said that from one of the
room’s paneled doors, a staircase
rises one floor to the roof of the
Cathedral where there is a prome-
nade open to the sky.

“The students have access to any
room or floor provided they go
through the proper channels,” Ske-
wis said. “The U_niversity is trying to
preserve these rooms for all genera-
tions of students.”

ous Grimm fairy tales—-Hansel and
Gretel at the gingerbread house, Lit-
‘tle Red Riding Hood, Cinderella and
Prince Charming -and Snow White
with the Seven Dwarfs—delight
children as well as adults.

The Polish room contains a por-
trait of the astronomer Copernicus
studying the heavens from the roof
of his uncle’s house.

Other classrooms include: the
Czechoslavakian, English, French,

Greek, Hungarian, Irish, Italian, '

Lithuanian, Norweigian, Polish,
Romanian, Russian;Scottish, Swed-
ish, Syria-Lebanon and Yugoslavian
rooms, an Early American room
depicting a colonial home in the
1600s and the recently refurbished
Croghan-Schenley ballroom.
According to E. Maxine Bruhns,
director of the Nationality Rooms
Program, groups are actively plan-
ning five new rooms. “The new
rooms will include one African Her-
itage classroom, Armenian, Aus-
trian, Israeli and’ Ukranian and
inquiries have been made for a Latin
American room. All new rooms
would be on the third ‘floor, at the

peak of the Commons Room,
affording a beautiful view.”

Chancellor Bowman described
the ‘effect of the Nationality Rooms
when he said: “In such surround-
ings, the boundaries of the student
are extended. He,no longer lives
only on the street where his home is,
or in Pittsburgh, or in Pennsylva-
nia...The greatness of Greece, of
Norway, of China, or of most of the‘
world is brought to him. He
becomes part of that greatness. It is
friendly. He likes it and lives it.
Copernicus, Goethe, Carlyle,
Michael Angelo, Montaigne, Kos-
suth, and Li P0 are no longer dim
figures moving through the past.
They are real and human. They are
his friends. They, too, have had their
difficulties and their triumphs, but
they show him, as only the great
can, how to reach the limits of his
own capacities and how, at rare
moments to go behond horizons to

’ the inspiration of truth.”

Many of the rooms are open daily.
Others can be viewed by appoint-
ment by calling x 6000.

which came from William Croghan Jr.’s 29 room man-

sion located in Stanton Heights.

Up And Down Netters Win ;
Seek Respectable Record

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

The Pitt tennis team, With the.

murderous part of its schedule
completed and talk of a .500 record
springing up, began on its road
back to respectability with a 7-1
thumping of an outmanned St.
Vincent team. >
“Our goal is 6-6. We've already
played all of the tough teams, and
we should be able to finish with a
.500 record,” Pitt head coach
George Dieffenbach said.
Dieffenbach’s' optimism may be
a little pre-mature. While his team
composed solely of walk-ons has at
times shown the ability to play a
good game. if not an inspired one

. -.r.- .

(a big upset of Duquesne serving as
chief example), it has not yet gar-
nered the art of being consistent. In
fact, the only consistent thing
about the team is its inconsistency.

Case in point: After an emo-
tional win over Duquesne, Diet-
fenbach was counting heavily on
heating West Liberty, and Califor-
nia State, albeit narrowly. Though
evenly matched, Pitt had beaten
both by 5-4 scores last year. Diet-
fenbach figured his team would use
the momentum acquired ‘in the
Duquesne match to win ‘ the
matches. At least one match,
anyway. ,

Final Score: Pitt .4, West Liberty
State 5. A . i

“I was very disappointed,” Diet-
fenbach said.

Once again Dieffenbach’s team‘
fell victim to teams with scholar-
ship players, teams that went out
and looked at tennis players, not
those that waited for the players to
come to them.

“We gave them good matches,

but they had scholarship players," '

Dieffenbach said.

Against St. Vincent, Dieffen-
bach’s team faced no such problem.
Pitt wiped‘St. Vincent off last year
9-0, and the 7-1 score came as a
surprise to no one. -

Revengeful Spikers Psyched For PSU Rematch

By LISA GRENEVICKI



Revenge. That‘s what will be on
the mind of the Pitt men’s volley-
ball team members as they host the
Eastern champion Penn State Nit-
tany Lions tonight at 7 p.m. at the
Pitt Field House.

The Panthers will be out to
avenge last Wednesday's loss to the
nationally ranked Nittany Lions.

In that match, Penn State had a
field day with the Panthers, who
just couldn't do anything right,
according to Pitt Coach Ray
Reilly.

"We played terrible," said
Reilly. “Our defense, especially
our blocking, was very weak at
Penn State.”

In order to help correct the on-
court errors, Reilly has been work-
ing the Pitt Spikers harder than
usual in practice. _

In addition to extra work on the . V ” _ 4 _
skills of the game, Reilly has had ‘ .  -  
the team members doing extra run— ' i V » P “ ‘P i ' P
ning, sit-ups and push-ups to
improve their mental game as well
as their physical game.

“We had a total breakdown in
our mental game,” said Reilly.
“The guys just had a lack of
confidence.”

The Panthers will have their
work cut out for them as they try to
improve their 3~3 league record.
One plus for the Pitt spikers is that
everyone is healthy, a factor Reilly
hopes can be used to the Panthers’
advantage.

“I'm going to switch a couple of
people around,” Reilly said. “I
hope that’ll do some good.”

vlt all winds down to this—can
the Panthers prove they are an
Eastern power by defeating perien—
nial powerhouse Penn State, a
team Pitt has never defeated in a
match in its existence.

According to Reilly, the Pitt
squad will have to play its very best
in order to fair well in this rematch.

“We’re just gong to have to p-lay
flawless volleyball,” explained
Reilly. “We'll have to execute well . . .  _   . _.  y
and play defense beyond our '_ _ ' ‘ ' ' ’
means.” a Pitt will need strong play at the net-- both hitting and blocking-- it the Panthers hope to upset third-ranked

WVU grade woes?...

While the West Virginia Moun-
taineer basketball team was pass-
ing with flying colors on the court
this season. several W V U players,
including Eastern 8 Player-of-the
Year Greg jones. are in danger of
not making the grade in the

‘ classroom.

According to a report in the
five"
WVU players are in danwgergof los-

      WRITE YOUR REPS  
    These men have a lot to sayabout

ing their eligibility next season,
and a sixth player, senior Donnie
Gipson, may not meet the grade
average standard necessary to stay
in school.

Despite the relativley high
number of players (six)-in grade
trouble, considering most college
teams carry a H-man roster, WVU
Coach Gale Catlett termed the
team's grade average“typical" for
any group of students.

“We have three or four players who
are making above average grades,
three or four who are average and
three or [our who are doing
poorly," (latlett said. “I'd like to
have all A-students, but it doesn’t
work out that way."

Catlett admitted that at least two
of the live returning players in

grade trouble may be ineligible for-

Il(’X[/ S('2lS()I1.

In addition to Jones, a junior
who has passed only 52 of 85 class
hours in his 2%.» years at WVU, the
other- players with a average below
2.0 are: freshmen Adam Powell
(1.50) and , Lester Rowe (Ltsi),
sophomore Michael King (1.64),
and junior Tony Washam (L92).
Both Washam and Rowe were star-
ters last season.

latlett said a player must main-
tain at least a l.6 average at the end
of his freshmen year, 1.7 as a sopho-
more, and ’ L9 as a junior. A
student-athlete must also pass at
least 24 hours of classes each school
year.

To be eligible next season, the
newspaper story said that Jones
must pass 20 hours with at least a
2.0 grade average and make up an
incomplete grade in English in the
current term and summer school, if
necessary. ‘

The overall grade average of the
team, according to the newspaper,
is 2.05.in a 4.0 system.

D’Amico Anxious To Get Gymnastics Going Again

‘I
.,,

By MIKE ROSE

Even though the Pitt men’s
gymnastics season is over,
Panther Coach Frank D’Amico
is already anxiously awaiting
for next season to begin. And it
is not hard to see why.

The e.v.cellent recruiting year
he is having, plus an extremely
difficult schedule coming up
have the fifth~year coach
already planning for next
season. , ,.

_ “We are facing every top team

‘in the East and many tough
teams from the mideast,”
D’Amico said.

The teams from the East that
Pitt will l)e facing next year
include No.3 Penn State, Tem-
ple, William 8c Mary,‘ James
Madison, Georgia, Georgia
Tech, Syracuse, Army, Cort-
land State and Southern Con-
necticut.

The mideast teams that Pitt
will be facing include Ohio

State, Western Michigan, Illi~
nois, Indiana State, Louisiana
State, and Southelr/n_g_I__l_li_nois.

D’Amico said he purposely
scheduled all these tough
teams. His purpose iszthat he
wants to beat these teams. In the
past Pitt could not schedule a
lot of these tough teams,
because they (lid not have a big
reputation as a strong gyrnnas-
tics team. This year. with two
national qualifiers, that reputa-
tion has started to change and
now a lot of regional schools
want to compete against Pitt.

One thing that will help
Pitt’s reputation even more is
the good recruiting year that
D’Amico is enjoying. He has
already landed Pennsylvania
all-around champion. Matt
Peters and New York all-
around champion Mark Klaf-
ter. According to D’Amico,
both gymnasts have a lot of
talent.

‘‘I am hoping that they learn
quickly,” D’Amico said.
D’Amico said both gymnasts
should help Pitt"s' high bar
team next year. The high bar
was Pitt’s weakest event. this
season. A

D’Amico is also looking for-
ward to the improvement of two
freshmen, john Gartside and
Ed Miller. “I expect Gartside to
mature in all events and become
a 9.0 C()iiip(‘lli()f,’” D’Amico
said. The coach also has hope
that Miller will improve in
parallel bars, rings, and side
horse.

With the tough schedule Pitt
will have next year, it is not
going to be an easy road to qual-
ify the team to the NCAA
National ‘Championships. De-
spite this fact, D’Amico wants
his entire team at Nationals
next year.

Pitt—Dukes On Hold

By JOHNETTE HOWARI5 V

The future of the on-going, oft-
heated basketball rivalry between
Pitt and Duquesne was put on hold
Monday afterofficials from both
schools ended in agreement on one
major issue: the game shouldstill
be played.

' The difference of opinion, from
the start of newly-appointed
Duquesne Coach Jim Satalin’s
tenure last week, is exactly where
the game will be played. _

After word of the hiring of
Satalin was

ence, the 34-year-old coach pro-
vided one of the few surprises of the
session when he proclaimed his
desire not to play Pitt at the Pitt
Field House.

Monday, Satalin met with Pitt
Associate Athletic Director Dean

' Billick to discuss the details of the

game site. Satalin would prefer to
always play the game at his home
court the Civic Arena. But, accord-

_ ing to Billick, Pitt had received a

verbal commitment from
Duquesne athletic director Red
Manning to begin a home-and-
away series with Pitt this season,
with a,Dec. 1 game at the Pitt Field
House.

Apparently that commitment
was invalidated when Duquesne
fired previous head c()aCh’Mike
Rice, hired Satalin, and removed
Manning. from control over the
basketball program. Since a con-
tract was not signed, Duquesne is
not technically obligated to keep
Mannings’s promise.

That decision is up to Satali 
. who now has the reins over such ‘

things as scheduling, basketball
camps and purchasing—duties
that were formerly handled by
Manning. '. '
Although Billick refused to com-
ment on the details of'Monday‘s
meeting because “This is a matter
we think should be solved by gen-
tlemen. in a private meeting rather
than ‘in the newspapers”--a,
Duquesne athletic department offi-
cial source said Satalin came away
from the discussion with a less ada-

-ment attitude about playing the

game exclusively at the Civic
Arena. Satalin was recruiting yes- ,

terday and unavailable 

comment. - ,

Satalin wanted to move the game
to the Arena because, according to
the Duquesne official, “He has a
murderous schedule to start with

and he figured ‘why play one more

1!

road game?’ ’ Duquesne also
thinks the emphasis on the game

‘ should be changed since Pitt and

the Dukes, beginning next year,
will be in different leagues.

“If we were still playing it as a
league game, we would agree on
the home-and-home format,” said i
the Duquesne official. “But now it,
has become more ofan event. What ’

a bigger game is there in Pittsburgh

basketball?”

_Which is why the Duke officials ,. 

are pushing for the 16,000 sea.

Civic Arena. instead of the Pitt
Field House, which packs in about
6,100. The Dukes claim moving the

. g game would generate more revenue

for bothschools. Since the Arena _
would be reportedly considered a
neutral site, the Dukes have report-

‘ edly offered to share the economic

benefits of the game with Pitt more
equitably than it would ifthe game
were considered a Duke home
game. .
Which all sounds fine except for
one sticky point: Pitt isn't buying
the argument. In addition tolosing
the snake-pit atmosphere of the
Field House by moving the game to

the Civic Arena, Billick maintaiﬁlg

that a game there would not ge ,

\ ate much more additional revenue

for Pitt. .

After rental costs a_nd other bills
were paid to use the Arena for a
night, Billick said the game would
have to draw about 12,000 people .
for Pitt to make more money at the
Arena than it could be selling out
the Field House. ’

. By moving the game to the
Arena, Pitt would also los_e control
over things like concession and

8' 5 parking revenues, in addition to
the home court advantage. ~
