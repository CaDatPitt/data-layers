Quarterback club ends without F azio

By John Zaphyr

Assistant News Editor

The last session of the Foge Fazio
Monday Morning Quarterback Club
was held as scheduled, but without the
presence of Panther head coach Foge
Fazio. Unlike other meetings,
however, there was no discussion of
the previous weekend’s football game
— only a brief announcement stating
that Fazio had been dismissed from his
position.

“Since this was the last one, and a
lot of people wanted to come, we
thought we would explain what hap-
pened with Foge,” said Pete
Petropoulos, a Student Government
Board member who ran the sessions.
“And since Foge wasn’t here, we
thought we would get someone to an-
nounce his ﬁring who had been at the
morning's press conference.”

Jim Urban, sports editor for The Pitt
News, somberly told the crowd of
about 50 students that Foge Fazio was
ﬁred. Urban read a prepared statement
about Fazio’s dismissal and then ﬁelded
questions from the surprised audience.
Although the news was not good, the
atmosphere was surprisingly light. No
one expressed displeasure at the ﬁring,

and nearly everyone wanted to know’

who the new coach would be.

“It hasn’t been announced yet,” Ur-
ban told the audience. “But some of
the names that have been mentioned are

Lou Holtz from Minnesota and Don
Nehlen from West Virginia.”

The Quarterback Club began after
the ﬁrst game of the year and was
originated to increase fan enthusiasm
for the football team. “After last year
we thought we needed something to get
the students more involved,” said
Petropoulos. “And I think the sessions
did that. They were successful. They

 

“I like going to the
meetings, but I ’m glad
they fired Foge. He made
my four years at Pitt
miserable. ’ ’

— Norb Balint, Pitt senior

allowed the football team to com-
municate with the students and Foge
Fazio should be commended for his in-
volvement. ' ’

The idea for Fazio to appear at the
sessions was his own. “He decided to
come on his own,” said Petropoulos.
“And he has to be admired for that.
It takes a lot for a head football coach
to come and face criticism week after
week. I doubt if many coaches would
do that.”

Asked if the Quarterback Club would
continue next year, Petropoulos said he

was unsure. “I would like to see the
new board continue the club,” he said.
“But it really depends on whether the
new coach would be willing to par-
ticipate.” -

Despite the SGB’s eagerness to con-
tinue the club, some students believe
the sessions should never have been
started in the first place.

“I thought the whole idea was
ridiculous,” said Urban. “A major col-
lege football coach has too much to do
and shouldn’t have to bother with that
type of event — he has enough to worry
about.”

The students who attended the ses-
sion also had mixed feelings about the
club and Fazio’s ﬁring.

“I liked going to the meetings,” said
Norb Balint, a Pitt senior. “But I’m
glad they ﬁred Foge. He made my four
years here at Pitt miserable.”

Others agreed. “I really enjoyed go-
ing to see Fazio and all the players,”
said Mark Thompson, another Pitt
senior. “And I think it was unfortunate
that he was ﬁred, but we need a fresh
start. I think Foge wasn’t all to blame,
but someone had‘ to go and they
’couldn’t take the scholarships away
from the team.”

“I went to every one of the ses-
sions,” said Dave Richards, a Pitt
senior. “And I was very hurt when
Fazio was ﬁred, but if he can’t win ball
games then he should be ﬁred. I’ll miss
him, though.” I l

Fazio fired after
mediocre season

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

The University of Pittsburgh ﬁred
head football coach Foge Fazio early
Monday morning at Pitt Stadium. Fazio
had just finished his fourth season as
head coach of the Panthers.

“It is with deep regret that I an-
nounce that Coach Foge Fazio will not
return next year as our head football
coach,” Dr. Edward Bozik, Pitt’s
director of athletics, said in a prepared
statement. “We have concluded that
the long-term interests of our football
program would be better served if a
coaching change were made at this
time.”

-Fazio assumed control of the Pitt
football program in 1982 following a

,a three—year stint as defensive coor-

dinator and assistant head coach under
Jackie Sherrill. He immediately came
under scrutiny after his 1982 Dan
Marino-led team went only 9-3. The

"three years that followed did not get

any better. The Panthers went 8-3-l—in
1983‘, _losing in the Fiesta Bowl to Ohio
State, then won only eight games from
1984 till the present time.

“My only regret is that we didn’t
win more games. I am very proud to
have been the coach of my alma
mater,” said Fazio, a 1960 Pitt

_ graduate. “I’d like to thank the ad-

ministration for the opportunity they af-
forded me.” Fazio added, “Why it
didn’t workout? Sometimes there are
no answers, or I can find no answers.
I have no animosity towards the univer-
sity, it will always hold a place in my
heart.”

It is a peaceful parting in a marriage
that seemed like it was never meant to
be.

“Coach Fazio has served our foot-

ball program well as a student athlete,

assistant coach and head coach,” Bozik
said. “He is a man of great integrity,
dignity and compassion and he has
represented the fundamental values of

‘this university in the best possible

way.”

Pitt must now focus its attention on
hiring a new head coach. Reports
earlier last week said that Minnesota
head coach Lou Holtz was under con-
sideration for the job, but Bozik denied
contact with anybody yesterday.

“I have not made a single contact,
nor has anybody from this university
contacted any coaches,” Bozik said.

There have been some names tossed
around, though. Other than Holtz,
other coaches who’s names have sur-
faced are Louisville’s Howard
Schnellenberger, Mary1and’s Bobby
Ross, and West V_irginia’s Don
Nehlen. Bozik has already indicated

what characteristics he is looking for

in Fazio’s replacement.

“We are looking for a Division-IA
head football coach,” Bozik explained.
“Someone with head coaching ex-
perience.” He added, “We are look-
ing for a man who in many ways has

the same value structure Foge Fazio s

has.”

Fazio now moves on to whatever life
holds for him. He made no indications
about what he plans to do. .

“Right now, I do not know what I’m
going to do,” Fazio said. “I may re-
main in the college level, may try pro
football, or maybe I’ll get entirely out
of coaching for good.”

Fazio did reveal that he was offered I

a position on a pro staff during the
period he was head coach at Pitt, but

' would not go into details.

Pitt ofﬁcials will begin the search for
his successor immediately, with the
hope that a decision can be reached
within a reasonable time period.

PAT drivers to strike
if pays are decreased

Joe Krzywiecki
Staff Writer

Thousands of people in the Pittsburgh
area will be left without transportation if
the Port Authority Transit drivers’ union
goes on strike at midnight Nov. 30.

According to PAT spokesman Jason
Fincke, “Oakland generates the third
largest amount of transit trips in the state.
Most of our service goes to the Oakland
area and the East Pittsburgh area. Only
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh generate
more transit trips.”

Fincke estimates that 308,000 people
in the Pittsburgh area use PAT and that
60 percent of the people who work in the
downtown area depend on PAT as their
primary means of transportation.-

Fincke also said that he could not
possibly estimate the exact number of
people who would be affected by the
strike, but he did say that “every citizen,
whether he drives a car or takes a bus,
will be affected by the strike.” Fincke
added that even if people carpool and use
vans, the “trafﬁc jams would be enor-
mous.”

The labor dispute between PAT and
local union 85 of the Amalgamated Tran-
sit Union concerns proposed wage cuts
for the drivers.

PAT wants the union membership to

_ t‘ak.e.a. 20. p<.=.rccI.1.t.wage .c_u.t and eliminate

   

the cost of living increases. Local 85,
however, wants its members to have a 25
percent pay raise, Fincke said. Union
drivers now earn $12.94 an hour-. With
a 25 percent raise, union drivers can
expect to earn $16 an hour, for a 40-hour
week. _

PAT is faced with decreasing state sub-
sidies and loss of ridership. Fincke said
they are unable to meet the union’s‘
demands for a pay increase unless they
raise fares on the transit system.

A 20 percent pay cut would enable A

PAT to continue with the present level
of service without fare increases or cuts
in routes.

Although there is a news blackoutaon
the present status of negotiations
Fincke said that both sides are meeting
“from early in the morning until late at
night, usually past midnight. Hopefully
everything will be worked out, and a
strike can be averted.”

PAT drivers previously went on strike.

for three days in 1976 before they were
ordered back to work by a court order.

In the past year ﬁnancial difﬁculties
have plagued the PAT system. A transit
tax plan was met with great hostility by
the state legislature. Efforts to change the
Port Authority Act, that created the
system in order to improve labor and

management efficiency, also met with no‘

success. .

Egypt implicates Libya

Egypt — Only one of the five ter-
rorists who hijacked an Egyptair
jetliner is alive and Egypt wants to
question him.

The state-controlled Egyptian
newspaper said authorities in Egypt
asked Malta to keep the air pirate in
custody. He is hospitalized and his con-
dition has not been revealed.

Egypt’s news media today reported
that Libya was behind the hijacking.
Egypt itself identiﬁed the hijackers as
members of a faction opposed to the
leadership of PLO Chairman Yasir
Arafat. While not ﬂatly accusing Libya
of organizing the hijacking, Egyptian
president Hosni Mubarek left little
doubt that he strongly feels that is the
case.

Mubarek said that if his nation
resorts to war with Libya because of
the airline hijacking it will be for what
he terms “the sake of peace.”

The drama began on Saturday night
when the Athens-to-Cairo Boeing 737
was commandeered after takeoff to an
airport in Malta. The 30 hours of ter-
ror ended Sunday night when 25 Egyp-
tian commandos stormed the plane,
resulting in a 10-minute gun battle.

A total of 60 people died in the
bloodiest hijacking and rescue in
history. One of the dead was an
American, 38-year-old Scarlett

Rogenkamp from Oceanside, Calif.
Rogenkamp's family said she thought
security at Athens airport had been im-
proved and was determined not to let
the dangers of terrorism change her
life.

Another American passenger is alive
today because of his quick thinking.
Twenty-eight-year-old Patrick Baker of
Salmon, Wash., faked death. A hi-
jacker fired his pistol from close range
but it only grazed Baker’s head. He
rolled off the plane when n0 One W35
looking and escaped.

Philadelphia racial
conﬂict continues

PHILADELPHIA — The racial con-
troversy in Philadelphia continues. The
black couple which had earlier been the
victims of racial demonstrations by as
many as 700 whites is now planning to
move out of the neighborhood. The
racist demonstrators had demanded that

the couple move out of their all—white,
blue-collar area. Black officials and
leaders such as Philadelpha mayor
Goode are urging the couple to stay.

Anti—nukers
arrested in UK

Britain — At least four policemen
have been injured and nine civilians ar-
rested during an anti—cruise missile
demonstration. Demonstrators
gathered outside the base at Greenham
Common and hurled paint at a truck
convoy. Protestors have been camped
outside the U.S. facility since 1983
when it was first announced that cruise
missiles would be stationed there.

Reporters left
cold turkey

White House reporters who tried to
ask President Reagan about the hi-

jacked Egyptian airliner and the bloody
end to that incident were told to talk
turkey yesterday. The President said he
would take questions only about the
60-lb. bird presented annually to the
White House. This year the bird was
named Wilfred, which Reagan pointed
out as etymologically meaning
“resolute for Deace.”

23-year-old man
spared execution

Texas — Condemned killer Jay Kelly
Pinkerton has been temporarily spared
from execution. Supreme Court Justice
Byron White yesterday granted the
23-year-old former apprentice butcher,
a stay, hours before he was to be put
to death by lethal injection. Pinkerton
was scheduled to die for murdering and
mutilating a woman while her childen
slept nearby. He would have been the
youngest to be put to death since capital
punishment was reinstated in 1976.

Vice provost talks with law students

By Michelle Zollner
Staff Writer

On Monday evening, an open forum
was held at the law school with Vice
Provost Dr. Henderson ﬁelding ques-
tions from law students concerned with
the current budget disputes.

When the students asked questions
about the three key issues — the truth
behind Dean Richard Pierce’s resigna-
tion, the law school’s present budgeting
situation and its future status — they
expected speciﬁc answers, but received
only general responses.

The students voiced their concerns
about the resignation of Pierce, focus-
ing on the truth behind his decision to
leave. Henderson simply said, “The
dean’s demands were more than we
could afford.”

Besides wanting more money, Pierce
reportedly wanted to run the law school
like an auxiliary fund. This plan would
have sent tuition’ money, state alloca-
tions and money from outside the
university directly to the law school.
The law school would then pay an
overhead cost to the university. The ad-
ministration’s answer was “no, that’s
not how we do business.” Henderson
said, “Talk to Wesley Posvar, he can
explain the university’s policy. _

‘ ‘All schools’ tuitions go into the pot.
Then, the funds get reallocated across
the university,” stated Henderson. He
continued, saying the funds are not ear-
marked; instead, each school gets a
lump sum and distributes it as needed.
The money is apportioned to the dif-
ferent schools not on the basis of the

amount of students’ total tuition, but
“need and aspirations,” according to
Henderson.

“No school makes enough from tui-
tion; they are all subsidized,” Hender-.
son said. “The goal of the university
is to bring in enough money to run an
institution while also subsidizing
others.”

The administration seems to realize
the financial difficulty of the law
school. Henderson agreed, “[The law
school is] underfunded, and it has been
so for the last 15 years, maybe
longer.” The problem," Henderson
said, is that “we don’t have enough
money to cover the university.”
Therefore, he said, the law school’s
new dean and its faculty must establish
priorities. This means that the law
school “may not have.what it wants to
have,” but it will still be functional.

The ability for _ lawyers to pay,
Henderson continued, is one of the
reasons the law school’s tuition was
raised 17-18 percent. He also said there
was a normal increase plus an addi-
tional surcharge. The surcharge went
directly to the law school; however, the
normal increase went to the tuition pot.

When a student asked why the ad-
ministration didn’t exert more effort to
keep Pierce on staff, Henderson
replied, ‘ ‘Our resources are not enough
to keep Richard Pierce.” Henderson
did say that he would join a group of
students if they felt they could convince
the dean to stay. He also said he would
be open for questions at his campus of-
free, 826 Cathedral of Learning, or by
telephoning the same office at
624-4223. Those questions which he

cannot answer, he said, he would be
able to refer to the proper individual.

In the new dean search, Henderson
‘said, “We go after the best we can get;
if he doesn’t come, we’ll go for second
best.

“In the future,” Henderson said,
“[the administration] is dedicated and
committed to the law school.”
However, he added, “The administra-
tion does not prize the law school over
others. [The plans] require time — we
don’t have dollars ﬂowing free."

Upcoming strategies in raising funds
include targeting low priority schools
and either merging or terminating
them, so that their funds could go
toward high priority programs. The
university also intends to include the
law school in its anniversary fund drive
celebration in 1986.

Next year, the law school will be
receiving an additional $150,000
allocation plus a one-time $50,000
allocation. Henderson emphasized,
“We [the administration] have not
given funds to other schools like that.”

Students asked Henderson how next
year’s allocations would compare to
any tuition increases and state alloca-
tions money. He answered, “We may
be able to increase the money the Pro-
vost committed for next year.” But
Henderson made no promise of im-
mediate change. He said there would
be no assurances beyond next year’s
allocations at all. In general, he said it
would take four to-ﬁve years to get
enough money “to meet the demands
of the increasing law school budget.”

Close Shave In B

urma/Stephen Morrison

Domestic Mayhem — Source: Doggie

My family and I have made the pain-
ful decision to have our pet dog, a
faithful friend of 15 years,
electrocuted.

When I say “electrocuted,” do not
think that I speak of the cold, clean,
state-sanctioned murder by means of
several lethal blasts of voltage in a
clinical environment that has attained
popular approval in this century. I refer
to nothing as humane as that.

What we shall do is this: We shall
put doggie in a tubful of warm water.
showing him love and affection, and
with every precept of giving him a

bath. When he is well soaped down, ,

trusting us, perhaps wagging his tail,
only then will we reveal the plugged-
in toaster that we had concealed, and,
as his fate dawns upon his animal brain,
throw it in with him.

What has driven us to this? Well, you
see, life with doggie has lately become

intolerable. ,_

It all began several years ago when
our veterinarian diagnosed that our
canine friend had developed an obscure
disease. He had acquired what is
known as “heart cough.” What this
meant was that somewhere inside him,
near his stomach I think, water was col-
lecting. As it accumulated there, some
of it would leak into his internal organs,
principally his heart and lungs, giving
him the gagging, retching hack that had
outraged us for weeks. There was
nothing to do, the doctor said, other
than to have him “drained,” but he
was so old that he might not stand it.
It was decided that the best thing was
simply to live with it, letting the poor
animal enjoy his ﬁnal days in peace.
We resigned ourselves. The good doc-
tor said, “I am afraid he will die very
soon.”

That was over three years ago. Since

then, our dog has swollen to elephan-
tine proportions, coughs continuously,
breathes only with great difficulty and
shows absolutely no sign of expiring.
He waddles from room to room, mak-
ing the noise of 10 dogs: wheezing,
panting and generating every ﬂatulent
emission known in the animal
kingdom. He has grown lethargic; in
his wretched bestial senility, he no
longer seems to care what anybody
thinks of him — he merely indulges all
of his bodily functions as though he had
no muscular control left at all, and he
meets our protestations with bland in-
difference. He will lie there in a pool
of his own excrement, looking at us as
if to say, “What are you going to do
—— hit me?”'

We, of course, would not dream of
hitting him.

But we might, conceivably, be will-
ing to tolerate all of this were it not for

one thing, the one thing that makes it
impossible to continue living with him,
and that has driven us to our tormented
resolution of murder: his cough. Allow
me to describe it. It begins with a
breathy huh — that is the signal, the
prelude that makes your ﬁngers grip
the arm of the chair and your muscles
tense in anticipation. From huh, he
moves to several rhythmic hock-hock-
hacks. There may be as few as four and
as many as 20 of these. All the while
you are vaguely aware of something
wet deep inside him working its way
out. The cough climaxes with a horri-
fying huh-ywatch.’ and the animal tastes
something around in his mouth and
then swallows it. Several moments
later, the cycle repeats.

He is now able to do this even in his
sleep. I have watched him. He lies
there, at peace, his limbs twitching as
he “chases rabbits,” and suddenly he

   

will emit the peremptory huh, and run
the loathsome course of his cough’
without waking for an instant. His
eyes, at least, never open.

Indeed, I am even beginning to
suspect that our distress gives him
pleasure. Bored with eating and sleep-
ing —— adequate amusements for anyone
—— he now seems to really enjoy watch-
ing us rage over his foul afﬂictions. I

‘believe that his intention is to drive us .

mad; he has come close to achieving
this. .

And so, the toaster. Do not think us
depraved or cruel. The beast will prob-
ably feel nothing more than a sharply
warm sensation, and then oblivion. His
nerves are past detecting any extremes.
May I simply conclude with the advice
that, should your veterinarian ever tell
you that your pet has a “heart cough,’ ’
do the thing a favor and kill it
immediately.

Peripheral View/Kelly Shaffer

X—mas Is Coming A Triﬂe Too Early, So I’m

Right now I can’t even face the
thought of Thanksgiving and what do
I see at the local shopping mall — Santa
Claus!?! Come on people! Soon we’ll
be celebrating Labor Day, Thanksgiv-
ing and Christmas all at the same time!
We can play a friendly game of
volleyball, have our turkey barbecued
outside on the patio and open our gifts
under the blazing sun.

In my opinion Christmas should not
officially begin until Dec. 15. That way
we only have to suffer through approx-
imately 10-14 days of it. As things are
going now, we have ninevweeks of it.
At this rate, I’ll be sick of Christmas
by Dec. 1. Then what do I face? Three
more weeks of ho-ho-ho and holiday
cheer. Wonderful.

Christmas, with all its joys and hap-
piness also brings too many hassles.
First, there’s the shopping for Mom,
Dad and the brothers and sisters.
Something for Aunt Elizabeth is
necessary as well as the bottle for Un-
cle Henry (never try to give him a tie
or socksl). Then there are the gifts for
your bosses and co-workers whom you
can’t stand. And don’t forget, your
mom told you to pick out something
nice for the next-door-neighbors who
call the police on all of your parties!

The next step is picking out sicken-
ingly sweet Christmas cards with the
generic pictures of Santa Claus and his
eight tiny reindeer or a snowy land-
scape with a snug little cottage on the
front. Then you have to write all those

phony messages in them so that peo-
ple think you care enough to do more
than just sign your name.

 

Moving in logical progression, the
next chore is Christmas-cookie baking.
Now I love my parents, but the sight
of my mother with spatula in hand is

Getting Out My Shotgun

indeed a terrifying sight. My dad
always burns the damn cookies and,
consequently, World War III ensues
right there in our humble kitchen. Who
needs all those calories anyway?

I don’t know about you, but I’m just
not mechanically inclined. The art of
putting wrapping paper neatly around
a package and then tying a how that
doesn't look as if it had been chewed
on by a rabid French poodle is entire-
ly beyond my modest abilities. Even
Goodwill would reject my packages —
honestly.

Then the Big Day arrives. Your lit-
tle sister gets you up at the uncivilized
hour of 6 a.m. to unwrap those highly
coveted Christmas gifts. Now I don’t
know about you, but nothing — not

even a Brandy Alexander —— is exciting
at that hour of the morning. You coo
over the sweater “Santa” gave you. It
is the most putrid shade of green possi-
ble. The blouses are all the wrong sizes
and Aunt Elizabeth bought you a Barry
Manilow album. Thanks so much Aunt
Elizabeth — sure’ I like Barry “He
Writes The Songs” Manilow! Doesn-’t
everyone?

By this time, all the joy has been
pricked out of the festive season. Your
family bickers constantly, you hate
your siblings and you can’t wait to go
back to school.

I'm sure that you must think me the
worst Scrooge, but I'm sorry. I just

don’t see the point in prolonging the .

agony any longer than necessary.

Campus Beat

Alcoholism: Is college a breeding ground for abuse?

By Pam Marvich
The Pitt News

Alcohol abuse, rapidly becoming the
nation’s number one drug problem, has
taken a relatively new turn in the past
ﬁve years. No longer are self-help
groups, treatment programs and abused
substance organizations directing their
messages to middle-aged, middle-class,
excessive drinkers. Instead, the pro-
grams are targeted toward college
students.

Prompting this alcohol awareness is
the concern over the recentvrise in traf-
ﬁc deaths involving 18- to 20-year-
olds, and the multitude of campus ac-
tivities where alcohol is involved,
which end in ﬁghting, vandalism, or
death. For example, three years ago,
Pitt football player Todd Becker fell to

' his death from a Brackenridge window
when he, under the
alcohol, refused to use a door upon
leaving a party. And last year, a
Carnegie-Mellon University student
lapsed into a coma and eventually died
after being forced to drink 21 shots of
whiskey in a given time period during
a fraternity initiation.

College campuses seem to be a
breeding ground for alcohol abuse.
Drinking is everywhere —- at private
parties, at sports events, in campus
organizations — and is easily accessi-
ble. No longer, as was the case for
many in high schools, is alcohol dif-
ﬁcult to obtain, but is practically at our
disposal whenever wanted.

On billboards and television, and in
newspapers and magazines, we are
continually bombarded with images of
drinking as being fun and exciting —
away of bringing people together.
Spring break in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. is
a prime example, where numerous con-
tests and concerts are sponsored by
beer manufacturers with the hopes of
promoting “brand-awareness” by ap-

, pealing to these “entry-level
drinkers.”

According to the most recent
literature, people begin drinking social-
ly for a number of reasons, most
notably peer pressure. Although cer-
tain personalities are not predisposed
to become alcoholics, a person who
feels demoralized, feels that he is a
social outcast, has a number of heavy-
drinking friends, or can seemingly han-
dle his liquor well, drinking everyone
else under the table, is a person more
likely to someday become addicted.
Those people who drink for a speciﬁc
reason, such as a death or family ill-
ness, are more likely to be able to con-
trol their actions than those who drink
for unknown reasons. Once hooked, an
alcoholic drinks more from habit than
to resolve a conﬂict.

In the United States, alcoholism af-

inﬂuence of '

fects one family in three. As many as
15 million Americans have severe
drinking problems, while three million
of those are under 18. Each year, the
nation’s alcohol problem causes more
than 100,000 deaths and costs tax-
payers $120 billion.

One question experts are in-
vestigating is whether alcoholics can
ever return to social drinking without
suffering a relapse. Since alcoholism
is not a black-and-whiteissue, the best
answer is that it depends how severe
the problem is. By the time a person
can be clinically classiﬁed as an
alcoholic, though, it’s almost always
too late to return to social drinking.

“Many times people don’t take
preventive measures. Instead of pro-
action stuff, it’s more reaction,” said
Avram Machtiger, Alcohol and Drug

in the first place. Students reach the
program in one of two ways: 1) They
are referred by the Ofﬁce of Residence
Life because of alcohol-related in-
cidences within the university residence
halls; or 2) They have attended the pro-
gram on a volunteer basis, simply
because they are interested in learning
more about alcohol and its effects.

The second program is geared
toward Pitt’s athletic department, and
through time, Haberman anticipates
contact with all of Pitt’s sports teams.

“Presently, there is an alcohol prob-
lem among Pitt’s athletes, so that’s
where the concentration is,” said
Machtiger. “A good way of putting it
is in response to the need.”

A videotape is shown to participants
in the program, to dispell myths of
alcohol abuse on campus. Appearing

Educator for the University of Pitts-
burgh. “All of a sudden they ﬁnd
themselves faced with a problem, and
then it’s like ‘Oh my God, what are we
going to do now?’ ”

Machtiger, along with Shirley
Haberman, Director of the Health
Education Ofﬁce, is responsible for
Pitt’s alcohol treatment programs. The
university offers three programs —- an
alcohol education program, a program
for athletes, and a support group for
adult children of alcoholic parents —
with the hopes of educatingthe student
body to the positive uses, and
dangerous abuses, of alcohol.

According to Haberman, Pitt’s
alcohol education program is a non-
credit course designed to teach students
the dangers of alcohol abuse, and to
help detect the reason problems arise

on the tape are Dr. Kevin Bowman
from the University Counseling
Center, who discusses the
psychological aspects of drinking, and
Pamela Bowens from Student Health
Services, who presents the medical and
physiological aspects of having too
much to drink. Also appearing as an
outside consultant is a detective, who
speaksof drunk-driving issues and the
legal procedures which follow if a per-
son is arrested for driving under the in-
ﬂuence (DUI).

Previously, if a person was convicted
of DUI in Pennsylvania, the maximum
penalty was $2,500 and one year im-
prisonment, there was no mandatory
sentence for ﬁrst-time or repeat of-
fenders, and the license suspension
period was six months. Under the new
DUI laws there is a maximum penalty

of $5,000 and two years imprisonment.
Also, the mandatory minimum
sentences for DUI offenders include a
mandatory minimum ﬁne of not less
than $300 and minimum imprisonment
as follows:

lst conviction -—- 48 consecutive
hours

2nd conviction within 7 years -—- 30
days

3rd conviction within 7 years -—- 60
days .
4th conviction within 7 years -—- 90
days to one year.

License suspension has also been in-
creased to one year for DUI
convictions.

Theseharsher penalties for drunk- .

driving offenses are in accordance with

the National Minimum Drinking Age
Act, which is bent on forcing states to
adopt and adhere to an age-21 drink-
ing law by September 30, 1986. States
which fail to comply with this law will
have federal highway tax monies
withheld. Twenty-three states already
have a legal minimum drinking age of
21, while 23 others are pushing to in-
troduce legislation before the 1986
deadline. A few renegade states, "such
as Texas and Louisana, may forfeit
millions in federal highway funds, but
most are expected to comply.
Transportation ofﬁcials and other ad-
vocates of the bill, which nationwide
include 600,000 members in 340
chapters of Mothers Against drunk-
driving (MADD), claim this measure
Wlll save lives._ According to their
statistics,“ 18- to 20—year—olds are twice

as likely as the “average” motorist to
be involved in an alcohol-related acci-
dent, and drunk-driving accidents are
the leading cause of death in this age
group.

Opponents of this bill feel it is an in-

‘ fringement upon their constitutional

rights, and through campus action and
legislation, are pursuing alternatives.
The United States Student Association
(USSA) has introduced a bill, spon-
sored by Rep. James Jeffords (R—Vt.),
which requires the Secretary of
Transportation to return withheld
highway funds to those states which do
not raise their drinking age to 21 yet
manage to reduce the number of
alcohol-related accidents involving 18-
to 20—year—olds. In essence, the bill is
designed to reward states which
develop educational programs that have
a real impact on drunk-driving.

According to Machtiger, Pitt’s pro-
grams focus on value clariﬁcation, and
his goal is to help students understand
how they make decisions in their lives,
what kind of values they have, and
what kind of thought processes they go
through to make these decisions.

“I once saw a quote which read
‘College is the time to experiment with
excessive behavior,’ and I ﬁrmly
believe this,” said Machtiger. “It is
simply part of a normal developmen-
tal stage, which results in one’s per-
sonal limit-setting, his identity develop-
ment, and his self-concept.”

According to Machtiger, this ex-
cessive behavior does not manifest
itself only in the form of alcohol, but
instead can include such things as pull-
ing “all-nighters,” adopting special
diets, experimenting with one’s groom-
ing and personal image, and involving
oneself in different kinds of
relationships.

The third program at the University
of Pittsburgh is a support group for

. adult children of alcoholic parents. This

is Pitt’s newest program, and has been
meeting since September. Following an
eight- to ten-week trial ‘period, the
group will decide whether to continue
and open up to new members, to con-
tinue and keep the membership closed,
or to disband entirely. In any case,
there will be a group next term -— either
the same group with new members or
another similar group.

“With this kind of university, draw-
ing from various populations, you’re
going to find a lot of students who grew
up in alcoholic homes,” said Machtiger
sympathetically. “That’s one problem
that cuts across all socio-economic
groups, although it has a higher
prevalence in some than in others.”

According to Machtiger, many
students feel when they are at school,

Coffee and tea have been popular
beverages for centuries. Victorian
ladies gossiped over it. The British
take time every day to celebrate the

7 ritual of “taking tea."

Today, students consume mass
quantities of coffee, tea and car-
bonated beverages to keep them
awake through “all-nighters,” or
to get them started on their days.
The ingestion of caffeine-
containing products is part of our
everyday lives.

In recent years, this staple of the
student’s diet — caffeine —- has
been the subject of controversy

because of its potential to cause
health problems. Research has
proved that some points of the con-
troversy have merit and that some
are invalid.

Whether they are healthy or not.
products containing caffeine are big
business; over two billion pounds
of ‘coffee are consumed annually
here in the United States. It is
estimated that eight out of 10
American adults drink coffee — on
the average, three cups per day.
The statistics do not include tea-
drinkers or those who get their dai-
ly caffeine dosage from soft drinks.

three cups of coffee to wake up.
Unless my heart, is beating real fast,

“I drank eight cups of coffee
already today. ... I drink a hell of
a lot of coffee,” said Susan
Benedek, a political science major
at Pitt.

Our society’s main sources of
caffeine are coffee, tea, soft drinks,
chocolate and many over-the-
counter drug products.

may contain 110-150 milligrams of
caffeine; tea usually has 72
milligrams per cup. Soft drinks
average 32-54 milligrams of the
stimulant in each 16-ounce serving.
Cocoa, a prominent beverage at this
time of the year. is estimated at
having 50 milligrams of caffeine.

Advertised non-prescription
stimulants generally contain be-
tween 100-250 milligrams of caf-
feine. The weight-reduction aids
range around 200 milligrams of the
substance.

Caffeine is obviously prevalent in
today’s consumer products. What
does it do for the consumer? Why
do they keep ingesting the com-
pound chemical?

“Students are feeling the intense
pressure of academia,” answered
Shirley I-Ioberman, Pitt’s health
educator. “They want to get an A
on that ﬁnal or test. The pressure
leads them to feel that they must
cram by the midnight oil. They
believe that drinking coffee, eating
a candy bar or taking No-Doz will

help them stay awake to study
more.” ,
Some students feel that the caf-
feine they take in will help them
feel better. “It makes you feel more
positive. The-test doesn’t seem so
hard and the papers don’t seem to
be so long,” insisted Kuba.
Research has shown that 100-400
milligrams of caffeine taken orally
every three to four hours is an ef-
fective stimulant and that this
dosage will maintain mental alert-
ness in adults. Therefore, drinking
one cup of coffee will indeed resulf
in short-tenn mental stimulation.
It has been recorded in various
V studies that caffeine does affect the
central nervous system. Psycho-

they are also away from their prob-
lems. But it’s not as simple as that. It
takes a sort of going away and coming
back to the household to realize what
is actually going on there, and to see
what’s causing the problem.

According to Machtiger, what we
learned in those families — certain
beliefs, ideals, coping behaviors and
character traits —— pervade our lives,
and we’re not always able to look at
the root of the problem objectively.

The National Council on Alcoholism
(NCA) estimates that between 28 and
30 million adults presently living in the
United States grew up in alcoholic
homes. According to Dr. Stephanie
Brown, director of the alcohol clinic at
Stanford Medical Center, as many as
70 percent of children of alcoholics
become alcoholics themselves or

develop related patterns of compulsive
behavior, such as eating disorders,
drug abuse or workaholism.

In the October 1985 issue of “New
Age,” when asked of the weaknesses
of children alcoholics, Brown stated,
“Their problems tend to constellate
around four very particular issues: a
strong need for control, a chronic in-
ability to trust, a tendency to suppress
needs and feelings, and a sense of per-

sonal responsibility for all of life’s j 
troubles.” W

In addition to these three programs, -

Haberman also mentioned ‘ ‘Alcohol
Awareness Week,” sponsored by the
Office of Residence Life, which offers
seminars, exhibits and speakers pro-
moting responsible alcohol use. The
brothers of Phi Gamma Delta fraternity
(Fiji) have also organized BADD
(Brothers Against Drunk Driving) and
have taken their message of responsi-
ble drinking to local high schools. In
the future, Haberman hopes to develop
a course, possibly in conjunction with
the physical education department,
which deals with substance abuse.
Besides Al—Anon, Ala—Teen, NACA
(National Association for Children of
Alcoholics) and Alcoholics
Anonymous, there is also an organiza-
tion whose purpose is to encourage
responsible drinking behavior within
the campus community. The program,
entitled BACCHUS (Boost Alcohol
Consciousness Concerning the Health
of University Students) has chapters in
over 100 schools in 37 states. The na-
tional non—proﬁt organization, started
in 1976 in Gainesville, Fla.,~confronts
commonly shared attitudes toward
drinking, encourages moderation for
those who do drink, stresses respect for
those students who abstain from
alcohol intake, and recognizes that
there is more to being a responsible
drinker than simply avoiding
intoxication. '
_ Gerardo Gonzalez, founder of the
program, says the goal of BACCHUS
is “to change the attitude that it is good
fun and good form to get drunk.” Ac-
cording to the Health Education Ofﬁce,
there is no longer an active BACCHUS
chapter at the University of Pittsburgh.

 

Dae Hooker/The Pitt News’

“Many times people don ’t take preventive measures. Instead of
pro-action staff, it ’s more reaction.,All of ansudden they ﬁnd
themselves faced with a problem, and then it ’s like, ‘Oh my God,
what are we going to do now?’ ”

or society in general, individuals have
certain rights and responsibilities which
go along with drinking. They have the
right to drink or not to drink, without
being subject to interference and/or
pressure from any individual or group.
Many times, moderate, use of alcohol
can be part of a physically, socially and
psychologically‘ healthful adult
lifestyle.

In a 1983 study, “The Natural
History of Alcoholism: Causes, Pat-
terns, and Paths to Recovery,” Har-
vard psychiatrist Dr. George Vaillant
found that moderate drinkers (those
who do not exceed an average of four
drinks per day) often prove to be bet-
ter socially adjusted than total
_a_bstainers.

Whether one drinks or not should be
a conscious, carefully considered
choice — one not inﬂuenced by his
peers. In any case, wherever alcohol
use contributes to a person’s hurting
himself or others, it becomes alcohol
abuse. No matter what excuses they
may use, people are accountable for
their behavior while under the in-

to the point of addiction, they should
be encouraged to recognize their con-
dition and seek help.

Noticeably, America’s drinking

population is hardly confined to college

campuses, but rather the environments,
in which they exist. Between 1970 and
1980, the per capita consumption of
alochol rose in this country by 31 per-
cent,‘ while the advertising budget of
many alcohol companies rose an enor-
mous 203 percent. Unceasingly, the
message is drummed into Americans
that drinking is not normal but
necessary to relieve one’s frustrations
after a hard day at the ofﬁce or on the
field, or to serve as a catalyst to trig-
ger an evening of fun. Rarely is the
product described as a drug, nor its
abusers labeled addicts.

Though the solution to alcohol abuse‘
does not lie within the college campus,
it is a place to start. Avram Machtiger

g believes outreach is the key to alcohol

awareness.

services as much as possible, but if they

How to handle a hangover we saw
with Bacon or Ham w/soup

The hangover is a manifestation
of alcohol withdrawal. In its earlier
stages, it is the all too familiar
‘ ‘hangover headache. ” Although
the alcohol has been eliminated
from the body, a chemical im-
balance has taken place. The
digestive organs have been upset,
and an overpowering fatigue is felt
in every muscle.

0 Alcohol has the effect of a
depressant on the central nervous
system. With time, this effect is
removed, and an increase of sen-
sitivity to stimuli is produced. The

. "reticular activating system which

controls the general arousal level is
particularly affected.

0 Chemicals that are added to
alcoholic drinks for ﬂavoring or '
coloration may cause headaches.

_ 0 Dehydration may also be a

cause of the hangover. The hor-
monal regulation of urine is upset,
so there is a greater loss of water
from the body. This causes the feel-
ing of always being thirsty, which
is popularly known as “cotton-
mouth.”

. Alcohol depletes the body of its
blood sugar, causing the brain to be
deprived of a necessary nourish-
ment. Symptoms include: weak-
ness, hunger, sweating, ner-
vousness, tremors and headaches.

0 The brain receives less oxygen
when there is alcohol in the system,
adding to the feeling of fatigue the
next morning.

0 Alcohol increases the produc-
tion of gastric juices to the stomach.
This increase may induce vomiting
and cause the body to work harder
to neutralize the , gastric juices,»

causing an upset stomach the next
morning.

0 Alcohol disturbs neurochemi-
cals in the brain, disrupting the
essential R.E.M. sleep and causing
awakenings throughout the night.
This causes tiredness throughout
the next day.

0 Alcohol produces a feeling of
warmth by sending more blood to
the extremeties. However, the
blood vessels will contract, causing
a continuous cold feeling. The
vascular changes may also be the
cause of the headaches associated
with a hangover.

The information provided above
is based on theories —— there are no
proven facts about the cause of the
hangover. Therefore, it is possible
that the only cure for the hangover
is to not drink excessively..

Caffeine

continued from page 6
motor coordination, the EEG spec-
tra, mood, sleep, cognition and
behavior are reportedly affected by
the intake of caffeine.

Studies report that the drug has
an adverse effect on motor response
time in both the visual and auditory
form. Also, caffeine might disrupt
the fine motor coordination need-
ed for complex tasks.

Scientists have also recorded
significant changes on the EEG
(electroencephalographic) spectra.
In a test, the caffeine’s effect could
be distinguished from that of decaf-
feinated coffee or a placebo.

Caffeine has been documented as
causing an increase of vigilance, as
well as causing feelings of
heightened anxiety. It also disrupts
sleeping patterns while reducing the

‘ quality of sleep. It seems that spon-
taneous awakenings and arousabil-
ity will increase after caffeine
consumption. '

Although research is scarce in
this area, some studies have sug-
gested that the substance will in-
crease the capacity for sustained in-
tellectual effort, but won’t improve
numerical reasoning, short-term
memory or verbal ﬂuency.

Caffeine may extend the amount
of time an individual can execute
physical labor. It also seems to in-
crease attention and slow the onset
of boredom. The-effect that caffeine
has may depend on the person in-
gesting the drug. Stimulation may
be exaggerated if the subject is con-
sidered to be caffeine-naive (less
used to caffeine). In the case of the
chronic user, however, effects are

"likely to be lessened.

Therein stems the controversy

concerning caffeine. Early studies

reported that caffeine would affect
the physiological systems of the
body. '

For instance, previous reports
said that caffeine increased the
heart rate, systolic blood pressure,
plasma renin activity and plasma
epinephrine and norepinephrine.
Also, the drug was said to stimulate
respiration, urinary output and in-
crease gastric acid to the stomach
and pepsin secretions.

At this time, it has come to light
that these ﬁndings might well be in-
valid, because there was no distinc-
tion made between the caffeine-
naive subject and that chronic user.

More recent studies show that
when caffeine-naive subjects
received a large (over 250
milligrams) dose of caffeine, such
increases and stimulations as listed
above came into evidence.
However, in the case of the chronic
user of caffeine, less metabolic
stimulation was noticed.

Ingesting large amounts of caf-
feine has proved to’ increase
metabolic activity and increase the
levels of free fatty acids. Chronic
use of caffeine might increase blood
glucose. 1

Pancreatic cancer and ﬁbrocystic
breast disease have been linked to
caffeine ingestion. Presently, there
is no concrete, tested evidence that
supports that theory.

Therefore, is caffeine potential-
ly harmful? According to research,
there are very few long-term
adverse effects of consuming caf-
feine regularly. It is recommended
by the federal researchers that preg-
nant women limit their intake.

Caffeine can be toxic when taken .
in abnormally large doses. The .
estimated fatal oral dose would be
about 10 grams, or 75 cups of
coffee. 1

As mentioned before, whether
caffeine is termed harmful or not,
our society still consumes. huge
quantities of the drug. Ithas been
suggested that one can become ad-
dicted or dependent upon it.

“I don’t think I’m addicted. 
I only drink it when I have to.
However, coffee could be a step-
ping stone to harder drugs, ” stated
Benedek.

“I don’t think I’m addicted and
I’m not worried about being ad-
dicted. It just helps me out,” said
Robert Marley, a business student.

“Any dependency is 90 percent
psychological rather than
physiological. It’s the mental games
we play with ourselves that feed the
dependency —— ‘I can’t start in the
morning without coffee.’ ” stated
Haberman.

There are physical symptoms of
caffeine withdrawal. These include A
headaches and lethargy. “You may
feel groggy the first day or two
after giving caffeine up,” said
Haberrnan. ‘ ‘But substitute a decent
night’s sleep and a good breakfast
for caffeine during , those
academically intense times.’-‘

Things were not right for Foge Fazio from the very

beginning.

Fazio was i a no-Win  

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

“Nice guys ﬁnish last. ”
— Leo Durocher

That statement was never proven
more true than it was on Monday when
Pitt head football coach Foge Fazio was
fired by Dr. Edward Bozik at an’ early
morning press conference.

It all began four years ago when
Jackie Sherrill headed for Texas A&M.
Sherrill left, and in the minds of anyone
who was associated with Pitt football,
there was only one man for the job, a
Pitt alumnus named Seraﬁno “Foge”
Fazio. Some said that Fazio could not
have taken over a better situation. He
iriheritedthe ll-1 Sugar Bowl Cham-
pions led by a kid from Oakland named
Dan Marino. Everybody picked them
to be No. 1. What a great opportunity
for Fazio. Wrong!

Fazio coached that Sherrill-built
team to a 9-3 record that year and a
berth in the Cotton Bowl, but that was
not-satisfactory.

“We beat North Carolina 7-6 in my
first game, but that wasn’t good
enough,” Fazio said. “We won the
game, but everybody acted like we lost.
It was just terrible. I don’t think you
need to subject anybody, especially col-
lege kids, to that kind of abuse.” Fazio
went on, “The kids were so happy and
elated after they won the game, then
the next morning, they read about how
lousy they are, what a bad team they
are, what a bad coach they have, and

Some predictions of what is to come

Here it is the end of November and
1985 is just about over. And right when
we areﬁnally starting to get along. Oh
well. what can you do?

I assembled the top psychics from all
of America’s leading newspapers like
The National Enquirer, The Star and

The Midnight Globe and I asked them '
’ what’s in store for the world of sports

in 1986. As you might expect, I got
some pretty strange answers, but I
believe them. After all, have you ever
known The National Enquirer to be
wrong about anything?

Here is a brief listing of the things
we will see in sports during the com-
ing 12 months. Maybe you’ll want to
clip this and hang it on your wall so
you can tell what’s coming; that way
you ‘won’t be surprised when these
things happen (and they’re gonna):

_January —‘ William “The Re-
frigerator’ ’ Perry balloons to over 900
lbs. after an amazing holiday eating
binge. Bears’coach Mike Ditka installs
Perry at quarterback and punt returner
for the Super Bowl. Perry meets
Brooke Shields at a Super Bowl party
and the pair begin seriously _dating.
Brooke's mother says she. approves and
that Perry has a “kind of macho thing.
I don’t know what it is.” The Bears
beat Chartiers Valley High. School
27-19 in the Super_Bowl.

_ February -— The Knicks’ Patrick
Ewing announces he is quitting basket-
ball “to ﬁnd himself.” Ewing says he
was particularly moved by Bill Mur-
.ray in “The Razor’s Edge" which he
-saw on "HBO one night. In other NBA
news the Postal Service announces it

' _will be issuing a stamp emblazoned

with the likeness of center Karl “The
Mailman” Malone. 
March — ‘Spring training gets into
full swing in Florida. Joaquin Andu-
jar gets in a shoving match with
Mickey Mouse at ‘Disney World.
‘Mickey claims the pitcher “was hitting

,- _on Minnie-. I.,_h_ad‘ t_o= do-something.”
‘

to strike. The Pirates are beaten 11-2
in an exhibition game ‘on March 17, but
new Bucco manager Jim Leyland says
of the game, “We always knew Char-
tiers Valley had a good team. They can

really hit.’ ’

April — The International Olympic
Committee announces the 1992 games
will be in West Beirut, Lebanon, and
Belfast, Northern Ireland. “It’s sort of
a joke,” says IOC President Yassir
Arafat. “We just thought it would be

- good for a few laughs if we held the

games in combat zones.”

May -— Lee Iacocca wins the In-
dianapolis 500 in a Chrysler K-Car.
Downright Upright, the winner of the
Kentucky Derby, continues the long-
standing tradition of winning horses not

making any commentsto the press. The

horse wins in a record 1:57:54.

‘ In a seven-game series the Chartiers
Valley hockey team wins the Stanley
Cup in a thrilling series with the Oilers.
Says Oilers coach Glen Sather, “We.
always knew they were a good team.
They can really put the puck in the
net.” .

The biggest news of all is that
William Perry and Brooke Shields an-
nounce their engagement. Brooke plans
to be a June bride. .
June — Thanks to the pitching of
Patrick Ewing, the Pirates are in ﬁrst
place in the National League East. Ew-
ing says he knew all along he could
pitch in the major leagues and thinks
he ﬁts in with the Bucs. “Basketball
was a way to pass time," Ewing says.
“Baseball is my real love.”
William Perry and Brooke Shields
are married on the shores of Lake
Michigan. Perry wants to honeymoon
in the Caribbean but.is told the islands
cannot support that much extra weight.

July — Patrick Ewing, is named "
. baseball All-Star game MVP. He wins

a Chrysler K-Car. Joaquin Andujar
gets into a shoving match with Nancy
Reagan before‘ the game‘. 1 ‘

6,512 NCAA rules and is placed on 25
years’ probation. Ofﬁcials are also told
at that time they will have to close
down the university.

August — William Perry and
Brooke Shields take on Joaquin Andu-
jar and Nancy Reagan in what is called
“Wrestle Mania II. ” A crowd of
90,000 is on hand in the L.A. Coliseum
as Perry and Shields win easily.

September —- The Pirates win the
division. Patrick Ewing is 75-3. “He’s
a workhorse,” Jim Leyland says of his
ace who started every game this year.
Downright Upright, the Kentucky Der-
by winner, breaks his silence and in a

Sports Illustrated article he claims,-

“Cocaine is a problem in the stables.
I’ve seen horses win the Triple Crown
while they were so strung out they
didn’t know what species they were.”
Downright has begun treatment at the
Betty Ford Clinic for Horses.
October — The Pirates beat» arch-

. rival Chartiers Valley in four games to

win the series. Ewing is 4-0 and is
named MVP. At the press conference
following game No. 4, Ewing an-
nounces he has to “get in touch with
his emotions” and is thinking of
becoming a tailback in the USFL.

November -- In its ﬁrst year in the

conference, Bowling Green wins the
Big 10. Northwestern is second. Pitt

1 Analysis

the negativisms just started right from
the beginning.”

The bottom line is that Fazio was in
a no-win situation when he took over
the program in 1982. That first season
would only be a preview of what was
to come in Fazio’s ﬁnal three years: a
lot of second guessing from both fans
and the media. _ ,

“We were 7-0 and ranked No. 1,”
Fazio remembered vividly, “but they
still blasted us in the newspapers. That
creates an atmosphere‘ that is very hard
to live under.” Fazio asked, “What do
you tell a 20-year-old or 19-year-old
kid? Your objective is to go out there
and play hard, let the score take care
of itself, you win and everybody is hap-
py. We were 7-0 and nobody was hap-

py.99

The last ﬁve games of the 1982
‘season were the most difficult. The
Panthers were knocked from their top

ranking by Notre Dame, lost to even-

tual national champion Penn State at ’

State College, then lost to SMU in the
Cotton Bowl. The losses were difﬁcult,
but the reactions to the losses were even
worse.

' “Eventually you are going to lose a
game,” Fazio said. “When we did, it
made the other people happy.”

It is hard to please perfectionists.
When you look at what the Pittsburgh
sports fans were used to seeing, then

of it. The Pirates won the World Series
in 1979, the Steelers had just won their
fourth Super Bowl, and Sherrill had put
a 33-3 record in his ﬁnal three years,
which, coincidentally, were the three
years that Fazio served as defensive
coordinator.

In 1982, Pittsburgh fans were un-
satisﬁed by the performance of Fazio’s
squad. Although, as Fazio stressed, the
Panthers were 7-0 and ranked No. 1 in
the nation, they were still subject to

 

situation  

' you know why Fazio had a rough time

abuse by fans and the media. Look at ~
Penn State this season: they were prob-'

ably, up untilthey blew out Notre
Dame two weeks ago, the most unim-
pressive No. 1 ranked team in a
number of years‘, but they won, and

every time they won, it did not matter-

by how much, just that they won.

So maybe what happened to Fazio on .

Monday morning was not a result of

the two consecutive mediocre seasons, .

not a result of the 31-0 humiliation at
the hands of Penn State, not a result of
not going to a bowl game in two years.
It started four years ago, and was a
slow, torturous process, culminating
with his defrocking three days before
Thanksgiving. Despite all this, he re-
mains optimistic.

“This is Thanksgiving weekend,”
Fazio said with a smile. “I‘m just glad
that I’m alive, I’m happy, and I have
friends around me."

Foge Fazio fought an uphill battle.
He looked adversity straight in the face
and never backed down. He will resur-
face someday, somewhere, and be a
winner. You cannot keep a good man
down.

St. Francis won't provide much
of a test for the Pitt basketball
team tonight. After all, St. Fran-

, cis is a small school with the
enrollment of only 1,100 while
Pitt is on the stepping stone to
becoming a powerhouseteam in’
the prestigious Big East Con-
ference. Moreover,‘ Pitt has
defeated St. Francis each of the 12
times they’ve met including a
104-88 whipping of the Red Flash
last season. Despite the fact that
Pitt should again dominate the
contest, the game is still a concern
of Panther head coach Roy
Chipman. '

“Every game has meaning for
us,” said Chipman, whose squad
opened the regular season last
Saturday with a 88-56 win over
Westminster. “Most of the so-
called good teams play weaker
teams in the beginning of the.
season, and they do have a pur-
pose. We want to work on
sharpening up our game.’-’

The Red Flash, coming off a
disappointing 9-19 season, started
the 1985 season on a down note
Saturday‘ bybeing blown out by
a not-so-powerful Kent State
92-59. Junior shooting guard Bob
Gullicksoii, brother of Montreal
Expos pitcher Bill, was St. Fran-

. cis’ leading scorer with 13 points.

St. Francis is a young team as
three juniors and two freshman
will start. One of the juniors is a
familiar face to at least one of the
Panthers. Lamont Harris, a 6-5
forward, is ,a junior—college
transfer; he was a teammate of
Pitt’s Tico Cooper last season at

Panthers to brush up
against St. Francis

Pitt will be led by 6-10
sophomore Charles Smith and

“We really don’t have anyone
to contend with Charles Smith,”
said St. Francis Sports Informa-
tion Director Kevin Southard.
“Our biggest player is Keith
Sayles, who is only 6-7 and a

St. Francis’ lack of height hurt
dearly against Kent State as they
were out-rebounded 56-30. With
Smith, Cooper and Keith Arm-
strong controlling the boards for
Pitt, it ﬁgures to be another long
night for St. Francis‘ head coach
Kevin Porter.

“We will go with a small and
quick lineup,” Southard said.
“But Pitt [is] extremely tough. If
they put pressure on our guards,
the game could be over in the mid-
dle of the ﬁrst half.” ‘

St. Francis found out against
Kent State what the results are
when teams play a pressure
defense. The Red Flash shot only
20-55 from the ﬁeld.

“They didn't shoot well at all,”
Chipman said after reviewing the
films. “I do expect it to be a
physical game with both teams
running the ball.”

Notes of interest: Students can
pick up tickets to both Wednes-
day’s game against St. Francis
and Saturday‘s game versus In-
diana (Pa.) at the William Pitt
Union with a valid student iden-
tiﬁcation card. ...Last season Pitt
scored 104 points against St.
Francis, the Panthers biggest of-
fensive output since the 1978-79
season when they blasted Rio
Grande. 107-82. Pitt's highest «
scoring‘ game ever came in 1970

Pitt   hockey gets third win

 

| .

By Mary Wolf
Staff Writer

While many of us sat in front of our
television sets Sunday afternoon watch-
ing in agony as the Steelers fell to
Washington, the Pittsburgh Hockey
Club was busy securing their third win
of the season over Penn State
McKeesport. The Panthers rolled over
the Saints 14-2 in a game which one
Pitt forward called “uneventful.” The
hockey club's record now stands at
3-0-0 in regular season play and 5-2-1
overall.

The Panthers were skating strong
after last weekend’s hard-hitting games
with Navy, but the team’s momentum
was unnecessary as the win over Penn
State came easily and without incident.

“It was a shame to play after that.
They [Penn State] were no trouble at
all. Not in the least,” stated right wing
Roger Oldaker.

The Pitt skaters will remain idle un-
til Dec. 7 when the Panthers will host
rival Gannon. Gannon finished the
season in second place behind Du-
quesne last year and is one of Pitt’s ma-
jor opponents. Earlier in the season
Gannon held a tournament to which the
Panthers were not invited, for what
some Pitt skaters feel were poor

reasons .

“I don't like them," said
defenseman Bill Kicinski. “They said
we play too dirty as a team. They’re
just afraid of us. We’re not dirty, but
we really want Gannon. We’re just go-
ing to play a good hard game. Gannon
is, unfortunately, going to come in sec-
ond again this year, only this time it
will.be behind us. You never remember
who came in second -— that’s why I
can’t tell you anything about them.”

There is one thing, however, that
should be said about Gannon. This will
probably be the stiffest competition that

weekend.

riié: Pitt News,‘ November"é7,:"l985i

the Panther hockey club will be faced
with on their road to the championship.
Pitt realizes that it’s going to take a lot
of mental and physical effort to defeat
Gannon because there is much more at
stake than gaining revenge.

PUCK NOTES: Pitt skaters Tim
Ross and Brian Owens both had hat
tricks in Sunday’s game with Penn
State; goals also came from Bele (2),
Bowers, Kicinski, Oldaker and
Barbara.

Does watching pro football on Sun-
day give you a ravenous, growling
appetite? Fear not, thou fairest fan.
Let us abandon all conventional food
items and see what's cooking in the
restaurants of the NFL.

Turkey — Sometimes mistaken for
the St. Louis Cardinals, who are ﬂut-
tering in last place of the NFC East.

Toast — Defensive back Elvis Pat-
terson of the New York Giants. When
one gets burned as often as he does,
there is hardly a more appropriate
nickname.

Hot Sauce — Jet—setters Dan Fouts
and Dan Marino are supplying plen-
ty of this spicy condiment to the rest
of the league with their high-powered
arms.

Rice — By itself, it’s as bland and
boring as the New Orleans offense,
but unlike Bum Phillips’ hat, it goes
with a lot more. A

Hot Dogs — Mark Gastineau of the
Jets. Even without the “Sack Dance”
Gastineau loves to show off his
wonderful self.

Filet Mignon — The Chicago
Bears. This diverse group should

. easily win the Super Bowl. That is,

if quarterback McMahon doesn’t stay
glued to the bench with injuries.
Jalapeno Peppers — Raphael Sep-
tien, Fuad Reveiz and Tony Zende-
jas. Like this Mexican delight, these

Thankgiving meal menu

Leg ofLamb —- Eric Dickerson of
the Los Angeles Rams. Without him,
Los Angeles is about as fierce as a
flock of newborn sheep.

Duck (Sitting) —- Warren Moon of
the Oilers. Playing behind a porous
offensive line like Houston’s, Moon
is one every time he takes a snap from
center.

Escargot — In its natural habitat,
this creature has a bit more speed than
Benny Cunningham, tight end for the
Steelers.

Mincemeat Pie —— Anybody on the
Bears’ schedule.

Apple Pie -— Despite their subpar
showing over the past few seasons,
much of America is still infatuated
with Tom Landry’s pretty boys.

Cream Puffs‘ —— The NFC Central,
aside from Chicago. Teams just love
to chomp on these tasty little morsels.

A1ka—Seltzer — Jay Schroeder,
Washington’s backup quarterback,
has calmed the upset stomachs of
Redskin fans by leading his team to
two consecutive wins. Practically all
hope was lost in Redskin Park after
Joe Theismann went down with a leg
injury.

Now, just one question needs to be
answered before this mouth-watering
menu can be closed and tucked under
the arm of maitre d’ Pete Rozelle:
Where are all these wonderful lef-
tovers going to be kept at the end of
the season? In a “Refrigerator”, of
course.
