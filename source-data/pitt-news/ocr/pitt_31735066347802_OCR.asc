Ali Pledges to Fight Pitt  

    Group Fund Freeze

By MREA CSORBA

Fighting the University isnow
his full-timejob, fired black studies
professor Yussef Ali declared last
week at an evening rally protesting
his termination. ‘

The assistant*professor whose
seven—year position at Pitt ended
April 30, maintained he lost his
contract due to the administration's
racist policies aggravated by his
political outspokenness. But Ali
said, reappointment would "no
longer placate him.

“It's not enough to give back my
job," Ali told the crowd of 100
which gathered on the Cathedral

lawn during change of classes.

‘‘I’m now forcing the serious issue
of Pitt's responsibility to the black
community.” »

Ali said that
should take the form  establish-
ing a solid black educational
program by increasing the “mea-
ger budget" presently allotted to
the black studies department, and
by allowing the department self-

' determination.

a “We get one-tenth of one
percent of the.total Pitt budget.
What can we do with that? And

even when we try doing something,’

we get contradicted ‘by the
administration,” Ali told the
predominately black crowd.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Dean
Jerome Rosenberg, Ali said
“knows nothing about black issues,
yet he interferes with the integrity
and self-control of the depart-
ment.” 1 u

Rosenberg earlier this’ year
reversed the departfnent’s vote‘ to
retain Ali as lecturer in a renewed
three-year contract while Ali
completed his Ph.D studies.

“I'm not. against the Dean
administrating University busi-
ness, but keep him out of our
department. His reversal of the

department's vote ;was the thirdi

major interference by Rosenberg in
three years,'l Ali charged.
Ali also said he wasn’t convinced

that the University had experi-

"crunch.” Pointing to the fact
there were several builings recent-

, the money was there but that it was

a matter of priorities. Pitt’s black

.studies department, according to

Ali, used to be nationally outstand-
ing, but it was unable to maintain
that standard due to lack of funds.
"I'm not antiwhite. I'm not

He called for a national program

grams for its other schools, should

preted recent funding cutbacks
from the Office of Correction
Education as indicating the pro-
gram is being eliminated.

Initial reports, which Pitt prison-
program advisor Fiore Pugliano
termed “innuendos and rumors,”
stirred controversy over Pitt's
exclusion from the eight-year-old
college program at SCIP. Marshall
has met with prison administrators
to discuss the possibility of funding
by the state Office of Higher
Education, and word» is expected
soon. -

Correspondence from the Educa-
tion Department indicates this
confusion concerns plans to in-
crease funding for “basic’.’ educa-
tion while decreasing funds for
post-secondary programs. The

their seats are filled.

All student groups without

(Continued from Page I)

"hit us as much of a surprise as it
did Pitt." However, Angert agrees
with the rationale behind the plans,
Stating. “Prison education should
be more basic and job-oriented.”
Future educational programs at
SCIP will include more basic and
vocational efforts; Community Col-
lege of Allegheny County (CCAC)
will continue to receive funding for
post-secondary programs of “skill
or certificate" nature, including
those in drafting and surveying.

Where these funding decisions
leave the Pitt program is uncertain.
Dean Marshall said, “The state
gets an incredible, bargain from
Pitt—for the $31,000 funding, Pitt
gives a program .equivalent to
$100,000.”

Misinterpretation of funding

decisions is a possibility. Educa-
tion Department correspondence
states. “Due to possible tuition
increases at the University of
Pittsburgh, it may. be advisable,
both financially and academically,
to negotiate more tuition cost with
Allegheny County Community Col-
lege."

,Marshall was quick to remark
that, unlike CCAC, “The Pitt

program does not charge inmates
tuition." ’ -
This situation threatens the only .

educational opportunity available
to inmates serving long sentences.
Except for the college program,
longtime inmates are excluded
from program participation.
Marvin Greer, SCIP Educational
Coordinator from the state, related,
“A nine-month minimum and a
three-year maximumeiare required
for program participation." While
acknowledging the harsh situation
facing inmates on long sentences,
Greer emphasized the reality of the
situation’ and the need to set
priorities.

Both Greer and Angert support
continued Pitt involvement on a
voluntary basis, and said they hope
inmates who have previously
earned many Pitt credits can finish
through the External Studies
Program. Th_r_ough special ar-
rangements several inmates have
been able to earn master degrees
and two inmates are starting
doctoral studies.

Reactions to the possibility of

Pitt's program reverting to the
volunteer effort initiated in 1971
include concern for the program’s
future. Robin Jones, prison college
instructor,’is “uncertain of all the
reasons behind this decgon.”

Although she agrees with the‘ need
for basic education at SCIP. Jones

is troubled by this situation “of no
compromise and tendency to

- extremes."

_Both Jones and Pugliano said
they believe the Pitt program was
"making real progress” and are
upset over interpretations of
funding decisions. They hope
some resolution can be reached
allowing Pitt to continue its formal
participation at SCIP.

Greer said this situation reflects
changes for correction education
throughout the state, but said he is
uncertain to what extent.
Jones and Pugliano are concerned
over "the lack of alternatives to be
found at this point, as well asithe
fading status of a liberal arts

education in prison environments, M

Greer believes there is a need for
“courses where a man can realize
his goals in a short time.”

While upset over the implica-
tions of this “situation, Marshall is
optimistic concerning possible new
funding. “This whole situation
may blow over without ever
becoming an issue," he said.

While
voluntary participation should
funding be phased out, Marshall is
uncertain of external studies
involvement, as this program was
active only because of CAS efforts.

”70 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh”

The resolution drafted by the Graduate and ‘Professional Student
Association requesting an English competency requirement for
faculty is a necessary evil, one needs to maintain quality education.
a fT‘h‘e resolution is as comprehensive as the one recently drawn“ up by’

the University Senate for /graduate students. ‘ ‘

Pitt prides itself on being an international University. Respected
. foreign lecturers and researchers are here as permanent or visiting
professors. Often these individuals are leaders in their field, and
have published in world—renowned journals, but many times their

English is far from perfect.

.Granted—students benefit when exposed to internationally-

 -renowned intellectuals- They can learn little, however, if they can-

not understand a word they are saying.-

. /I \ '
It is suspected that English competency is a consideration when
foreign educators are considered for a post at Pitt. All too often
the competency is allowed to slide to a degree proportional to the

need of a department for a lecturer.

\

It is time for those people responsible for faculty appointment to
realize the need for the faculty to be competent in English.‘ _’

g The University Senate did and came up with a competency
requirement for graduate students. A Pitt freshman’s first lecture

Football fans should not be
surprised ’or disturbed by the fact
that the University of Pittsburgh is
providing special consideration in
the form of preferred seating at the
stadium for those Golden Panthers
who contribute generously to the
athletic department.’

and effectively for years in the

Pittsburgh's own Stephen Foster,
who never saw Kentucky.‘ I have to
admit I'got all choked up, incurable
sentimentalist that I am.

Finally, not quite as an after-
thought, the gates bang open and
15 horses explode forwaiid, riders’
wliips ﬂashing, all bump and strain

‘and pound for running room.

Within seconds the dark tide pours
into the first turn, 15 sets of shining
muscles gathering and snapping at

every stride, the field starting to-

string out now, track announcer
Chick Anderson calling positions
like an auctioneer. Through the
backstretch it's For the Moment
and Seattle Slew neck andneck,
Angel Cordero and Jean Cruguet
up in the irons as if a split-second
before their mounts had collided
head-on with a brick wall, each
man, each animal testing the
others’ endurance and skill.
Coming off the ﬁnal turn, For the
Moment has fallen back and Seattle
Slew is running away from the late
sprinters, pulling away to four
lengths and then easing off to win
by a pair, rewarding the faithful at
1-2 odds and earning himself 1977s’
only shot at racing’s Triple Crown.

So it was over and I loved it, the
emotion. the tradition. the pa-
geantry, the excitement; it was
over and there was time to think
about it. and thinking about it, I
wondered just a little.

Bleeding heart_ that I am, I
couldn't help but wonder about the
place of the Kentucky Derby in the
real world. whatever that is. We
have a lot of pageants and holidays

School of Medicine for several
years where the stakes are much
higher, involving a seat in medical

to reward “friends of the Univer-

sity who have served the medical

and ‘disregard the rights and

high overhead and risky returns
make being rich a prerequisite to
rather than a consequence of
keeping jockeys inijobs. Despite
the profits turned on Seattle Slew, I
think fun is pretty much the name

of "the game for people like the

Taylors. Even so, it’s the people at
the $2 windows  not many of
them the horse\-/owning type who
pay for the rich to play. And we all
accept it without much question,.as
if that's the way things are. We
buy hope at the $2 windows, make

, bets on‘the American dream, and

that's the way we like it.

Or perhaps it's good to take the
Kentucky Derby straight, with no
criticism, like a universal Southern

time-outs from our introspection,

Relations between the Night

in April when both editors resigned
their positions claiming SGS
constraints and its hand in the
internal procedures of the papers
thwarted its credibility.

spent on spring and summer
programs to be channeled into the
general allocations account. Those
groups which forfeited programs or
student services because of the
budget freeze may request special
funding for rescheduled programs

once their assembly representative
is appointed.

"If students don’t participate in
September, we'll have to deal with
the problem again." Payne said.

Meanwhile. the assembly will

convene regularly and proceed with
its business of advising SGB on
proposed policies and procedures.

“We’re supposed to represent
the students in the best possible
way we know how. and that’s the
student assembly,” SGB member

Ahnie Baum said. “The assembly
should convene even with only 50
members, since these are the
people who are most interested.”

SGB member Josh Baylson, who
dissented, said, “The idea of the
assembly is for willing cooperation.
Students who respond to force
won’t be active anyway. Only by
establishing the assembly _ and
proving it is effective will groups
be interested enough to partici-

By M. c. PILECKI

Sometimes the worst thing about a
movie is its ad compaign.

Take the case of “The Little Girl
Who Lives Down The Lane.” From
the trashy publicity, you’d think
that this is another of those cheap
horror ﬂicks, with phony blood and
corpses littering the screen. As the
song says, it ain’t necessarily so.

“Little Girl” is really an
interesting, thoughtful ﬁlm with
occasional touches of suspense-
and a little murder. It’s one of those
“little” ﬁlms—low-budget but well

‘ made, with an interesting theme
but basically misunderstood.

Actually, the movie is more about
children and children’s rights than
mayhem and murder. It presents an
odd thesis about the “molding” of
children and their right to freedom
of thought. The presentation itself
is somewhat extraordinary, with
things stated a little heavy-handed-
ly.

Jodie Foster-one of the most
interesting actresses to watch of any
age—is the little girl of the title,
Rynn. She lives in a modest house
out in the woods, on the outskirts of
a small coastal village. Her only
companion—besides a pet ham-
ster—-isvher poet-father. Or so she
says. Somehow, he seems
conveniently occupied whenever

One of ‘the most obstinate about
doing just that is:Mrs. Hallit (Alexis
Smith), the town’s rich lady and
hag-in-residence. She’s. also the
landlady, and drops in, uninvited,
whenever ‘the mood strikes.

Because she’s the owner of the
house——-and an adult——she , also
feels it is within her rights to order
Rynn about and behave obnoxious-

~ly. She even goes so far as to start
rearranging the furniture, telling
Rynn that things are ‘ ‘out of place”

Score

because they don't conform to her
ideas.

Needless to say, nobody is going
to miss this witch.

But if she’s bad news, you ought
to get a ‘load of her son, played by
Martin Sheen. The guy’s a known
child molester (but never prose-
cuted because of Mommy’s pull),
and of course he sets his sights on
the nubile Rynn. Everybody knows
his intentions——and that includes a
sympathetic cop——but they’re
powerless to protect the girl.

Not all is rotten in Denmark.
Rynn manages to enlist the aid of a
young local, Mario (Scott Jacoby),
and eventually they become
friends, then lovers. 4 He’s also
sympathetic to her ideas about
staying free from adult ‘rule and
bring her own person. It’s an ideal
she can’t hope to reach if forced
through the grist mill of school and
adult authority.

Of course, Rynn is an exceptional
person, and the movie ) doesn’t
pretend to say that nobody should
grow up in what is accepted as the
“normal” way. But, as Rynn points
out‘, she is special—“not like
everybody else”—because she
hasn’t received the usual condition-
ing. '

However, to maintain her indiv-
idualism, she is forced to fight to
survive. And her means are not the
most commendable in the world.
True, she’s no junior Lucretia
Borgia, and those that do end up as
corpses are certainly no loss to the
community--but it’s a blight on
Rynn’s‘ideals to see her stoop to
such methods. -

This Canadian-made ﬁlm tells
much more succinctly about child-
ren and their will for individualistic
survival than other ﬁlms of its kind
(the movie version of “Lord of the
Flies” comes quickly to mind).
Still, the movie shades its story with
too much black and white,
overstating its case.

As a suspense ﬁlm, “Little Girl”
certainly has its moments. There is
little visual horror—-what there is
would have been better left
out—and most of the action is

Girl Down Lanej

W

One For

conﬁned to a single set (a common
practice in low-budget ﬂicks). Still,
there are creepy things happen-
ing-and the big mystery about the
fate of Rynn’s invisible parents.

Giving away too much of the plot
would be cheating, so suffice it to
say that “The Little Girl Who Lives
Down The Lane” is no blockbuster,
but an interesting movie.

With “Islands In The Stream,”
there are other problems-. It all goes
back to the basic thesis that many
stories are excellent in their own
medium——but they die when
artiﬁcially removed. ,

Ernest. He)mingway——more than
most writers—had a rare gift for
putting words together. His style
cannot often be faulted. But as for
plots-—the guy never grew up, and
too many of his stories are involved
with puerile ideas of machismo and
glory.

With his books, it doesn’t matter
so much, because one has that great
prose to enjoy. But make a movie
from them? Forget it. '

“Islands” is a lot of pretty
scenery in a semi-autobiographical
story of tough men acting tough,
and passing the heritage on to kids.
The plot’s as predictable as a
Republican national convention,
and the characters as shallow as the
nominees.-

The ﬁlm concerns George C.
Scott as Papa, a famous, twice-di-
vorced writer living a blissful
existence in the Caribbean before
the start of World War II. His three
sons (of course a he-man wouldn’t
have daughters) come for one of
their infrequent visits. Even though
they never see each other, they all
love.each other. Uh huh.

Papa also tries to get back with
one of his ex-wives (Claire Bloom)-—
the “one he always loved”—with
predictable success. Finally, the
guy vanquishes his sins of familial
neglect by becoming a hero in a
style reminiscent his worst novel.

Scott grits his teeth a lot and acts
manly, but unless you are (or were)
a fan of boys’ adventure comic ‘
books, “Islands In The Stream”
sinks.

  Panther Batters Lo

By MARY S. HUZINEC

STATE COLLEGE—-—It was the
kind of day a baseball player has
nightmares about.

The Pitt baseball team managed
to score a meager three runs in two
games Sunday, dropping a double-
header to Penn State, 10-2, 6-1, and
lowering its record to 8-6.

“It certainly didn’t help us, ’ ’ said
Pitt coach Bob Lewis, “but that
means we’ll just have to win the rest
of our games and‘ see what
happensf’

Although Panther Don Koller
scattered 11 walks in the 6-1 defeat,

F the rookie southpaw gave up only

one hit and two earned runs. His
teammates came up with two lonely
hits and neither of them helped to
produce the lone Pitt tally—the
result of Penn State error.

The Nittany Lions scored single
runs in the first and second innings
and Pitt came up with its only run in

the third. Dan Skinner, who scored “

all three Panther runs of the day by
walking four times and stealing four
bases, walked and reached second

on a balk. He then stole third, and

crossed the plate when Kurt
Leitholf bounced to the shortstop,
who bobbed the ball for an error.
In the fourth Mark Stevens
dropped a single into left and stole
second but was left stranded.

The Penn State ﬁfth was one the
Panthers would like to forget.

Koller first hit a batter and Leitholf V

errored. A tap to Koller followed
and he threw to third for the

/force-out. To load the bases a batter

was walked. On a 3-2 count the ball
was bouncedto Leitholf who forced
out the runner at second, but one
run was scored. Then came the lone

The Pitt tennis team traveled to
Ohio for a two-day tournament last
weekend and found the competition
much tougher than expected.

The Panthers, who entered the
tournament with a 6-1 record by
defeating mostly local teams, were
overwhelmed, 9-0, by the Univer’-
sity of Cincinnati on Friday and
were turned 2 away again on
Saturday by Washington and Lee
University, 8-1.

As was the case with Pitt’s only
other defeat this year (by ‘West
Virginia), the matches were forced
indoors because of rain. Even
though the Panthers 'haven’t had
much experience at indoor play,
coach George Dieffenbach did not
blame that factor for the double
defeat.

“Playing indoors may have given
the other teams a slight edge,” he
said, “but overall, we just met up
with good competition.

The buckeye state’s finer grade of
tennis emerged immediately as
Cincinnatti’s Bob Kronauge, who is
ranked 32nd nationally in the
18-and-under age group and 50th in
the men’s category, defeated Tom
Liebenguth, 6-0, 6-1, to start
Friday’s action.

Mike Habbel played a strong
match, only to lose to Cincinnati’s’
All Matthews, 6-3, 6-3, and the
Panthers’ number-three positioned
Kevin Quay suffered a 6-0, 6-3
setback at the hands of Scott Irwin.

Harry \I-Iabbel, Tom Gault and
Chuck_Br‘"and, rounded out Pitt’s
singles lineup, and although they,

~ like their higher-positioned team-

mates, lost their respective matches
in ‘straight sets, they made it close.

Harry Habbel lose, 6-2, 6-4, while
Gault fell in the tightest contest of
the day by a 7-5, 6-4 score. Brand,
who was to pick up the Panthers’
only win on Saturday, lost another
close one, 7-5, 6-3.
