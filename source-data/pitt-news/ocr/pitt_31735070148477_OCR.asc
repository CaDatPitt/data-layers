Pitt -political science professor
Kristin Kanthak saidit is difﬁcult to
tell which candidate will be the most
beneﬁcial for students in this particu-
lar primary because education has not
been a hot topic among candidates.
However, she ﬂagged Perryasapoten-
tialproponent of higher education. '

“Rick Perry is more supportive of
educationthanhe’smakinghimselfout
to be right now,” Kanthak said.

, She cited the Texas govemofs
policy of allowing illegal immigrants
who grewup in Texas to receive in—state
college tuition as an example.

Brandon Myers, apolitical science
Ph.D candidate teachingAmerican Po-

‘ litical Process this semester, said he
i agreed that educationhas taken aback-

seatto the economyinthese primaries.
But he said that Rorrmey’s solution to
the country’s economic problems

might make him the best candidate

for students planning to enter the
workforce in the near future.

‘‘All the candidates are emphasizing
that the economy is in bad shape and
that government has gotten way too
big,”Myers said. “Romneyis emphasiz-
ing that he’s goingto get the economy
going through job creation.”

Police warn pedestrians to learn street smarts  

Mallory Grossman
News Editor

Police and volunteers in bright
green shirts roamed the streets
of Oakland Wednesday, looking
for pedestrians who were break-
ing the law. ‘

Steve Cowan, the safety press
officer for PennDOT District 11,
said that a committee of local law
enforcement agencies and com-
munity groups decided to try and
increase pedestrian safety in the
Oakland area. On any given day
during the school year, Cowansaid
that there are 100,000 people and
more than 70,000 vehicles passing
through the 1.5 square miles that
make up Pitt’s campus.

“it’s important for everyone
to realize that one bad step in a
crosswalk” can lead to an accident,
Cowan said.

The committee, comprised of
the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation, Oakland Trans-
portation Management Associa-
tion, city police, Port Authority
police, Carlow University police,

Pitt police, Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity police and the Allegheny

County Health Department, orga—_

nized the event, which was meant
to educate people on street smarts.
The police did not issue citations
to pedestrians caught jaywalking,
but gave verbal warnings.

“All it takes is one second and
you can be killed,” Cowan said.

City police, Pitt police and Port
Authority police took the day to
give verbal warnings to pedestri-
ans and motoristswho were break-

ing the law. Volunteers from the

Health Department distributed
leaﬂets about pedestrian safety
to people walking by.

A Port Authority police ofﬁcer
said that the event was meant to
“give the public and students more
awareness of safety  and alleviate
accidents.” ’

The police targeted pedestrians
who jaywalked and crossed dur-
ing red lights, aggressive drivers
who ran red lights and sped, bi-
cyclists who weren’t obeying the
law and commercial vehicles that
were parked on sidewalks and in
crosswalks.

Walters said that it is "illegal for

bikes to ride on sidewalks in Oak- _l

portant event for students “who

’ tend to do things they shouldn’t '
be doing,” so that they areaware, ’
that next time they are caught, -

the police will hand out citations,
which require lawbreakers to pay

He said that eventhough police
only gave warnings to traffic viola-
tors, police will be citing people
at the next event they hold for pe-.

been scheduled.

Students seek Republican candidate tobenefit them

Republicans 4 1

trailing at 24 percent. Ron Paul is in
third place with 13 percent.

Pitt College Republicans president
Matt Vermeire said that his organiza-
tion conducted a straw poll of 30 stu-
dents two weeks ago, and Perry and
Romney came out on top. Romney
won the poll receiving 54 percent of
students’ votes and Perry came away
with 30 percent of the vote.

Like Myers, Vermeire said he be-
lieves job creation should be a mqor
area of concern for students in these
upcoming elections.

“Possiblythe singular geatest con-
cern for students is post-graduation
employment,” Vermeire said in an
email. “Thus the candidate we must

support is the one who can get the
economy moving and allow us to be
employed in the workforce —— a task
many in the ﬁeld are equip to handle,
Romney and Huntsman beingpersonal
favorites.”

But Vermeire said that as a policy,
the Pitt College Republicans don’t en-
dorse candidates before a primary.

Pitt College Democrats president-
Matthew DiFiore said he doesn’t know
which Republican candidate would be
the best choice for students.

DiFiore said that all of the candi-
dates want to repeal the Affordable
Care Act, which allows students to stay
on their parents’ health insurance until

' they’re 26.

However, DiFiore said he believes
the race will come down to Romney
or Perry. '

DiFiore said that because Perry
appeals to socialconservative and
pro-business members of his party,
he is a likely to win the Republican
nomination.

With candidateslikePerryjumping
into the race later, the dynamics of the
Republicans pool alters. , .

“Like Jon Stewart said, it’s the re-
verse of American Idol. It seems that

. each weelt we have new candidates

entering the race,” said Kristen Allen,
a political science Ph.D candidate who
is also teachingAmerican Political Pro-
cess this semester.

_ Although the ﬁeld of candidates
appears large this yearwith 10 declared

candidatesvyingforone coveted spot, ,

Myers said that the number of candi-
dates in this primary is typical.

“There are more candidates, but
not that many more,” he said, noting
that historically the number of can-
didates in a given primary averages
upward of 10 contenders.

DiFiore stressed that students
should be aware of the candidates’
stances on the issues, regardless of
whether or not the Pennsylvania pri-
mary will matter. Pennsylvania is one
of the later states to hold its 
which is set to take place Aprll»24,
2012.

“Students shouldbe aware ofwhat’s

going on even though the Republican , b
_ race will probably be over by the time

itgetstoPennsylvania, becausethe Re-
publican candidate is that person who
couldgetinto ofﬁce,”he said. “We need

to be aware of that person’s positions ,

- on the issues.”

Allen also emphasized the impor-
tance of students paying attention to
the Republican primaries and the is-
sues surroundingthis race. H

“Even if you’re undecided, even
if you don’t care, you need to care. In
college, you’re atanage whereyou’re af-

. fectedbythisstuff. Govemmentmakes
decisions every day that affects you,”_
Allen said. I '

Steven Merkiel,anelectrical engineeringmajor, '

said that he researched companies online and
brought several versions ofhis resume in hopes
of obtaining an electrical engineering job.
Accordingto the CareerFair’s brochure, many
of the companies and agencies were looking for
chemical, electrical and mechanical engineers,
offeringjobs ranging from entry-level to ad-
vanced positions. Some other nonproﬁts and
agencies had specific positions forbusiness and

accounting majors.

Jillian Petras, a talent acquisition specialist
at Enterprise Holdings, acompany that operates
rental car subsidiaries said the expansion.ofEn—
terprise Holdings allowed foran increase in jobs
availablethisyearfor entry-level sales associates
and paid summer internships.

She said that her company is looking to hire
110 management trainees and about 20 paid
summer interns. Sheusually receives about 1,100
applications for the open positions.

“The ﬁrst thing we look for is dress,” she
said. “First impressions can tell us whether you
look like you’ll be appropriate for the position
or no ” »

Petras said that Pitt’s Outside the Classroom
Curriculum has been beneﬁcial in identifying
qualiﬁed candidates for Enterprise. She said that
many employees have been hired because of their
excellence in extracurricular involvement.

“We look at experience with part—time work
and involvementinother student organizations,”

which she said canibe highlighted through stu-
dents’ completion of the OCC.

Petras also places a heavy emphasis on a po-
tential candidate’s level of commitment to work
experience when evaluating applications, rather
than just the number of different experiences a
candidate might have. _

“Having a few long—term work experiences
rather than 10 short-term jobs over the span of

_ ayearortwo shows dedication andthe abilityto

start a project and follow it through,” she said.
Another thing that might turn a potential
employer off to an otherwise well—rounded
candidate can be availability. Ah applicant that
comes off as “having other priorities” or “being
inﬂexible” during the interview process can be

p interpreted as lacking genuine interest in the
' position, Petras said.

Juniorjohn Nalls said that gening a j ob might
be more aboutwho a student knows rather than
what experiences they’ve had. Inhis experience,
a mixture ofhaving the right diversity of experi-
ence and knowingwho to go to for guidance can

. make or break a job hunt.

“Alot of companies make it look easy by hav-
ing online applications, but they really just hire
through people they» know or take references
from employees,” he said. “It’s all about knowing
those people.” . j

Nalls, amechanical engineering major, said he
highlights the diversity of his interests in inter-
views and applications, which he hopeswillshow
his willingness to be open-minded and ﬂexible to
‘employers. Although it was his ﬁrst time at the
Career Fair, he hoped thatby meeting employers
he would be able to make aﬁrst impressionthat
could lead to a summer internship.

Vanessajoseph, an assistant hiring manager
at Panerafranchise Covelli Enterprises, saidthat
having a good personality and showing genuine
interest can make a bigger impact on employers
than anything else. She urged underclassmen to
work on theirverbal and social skills before they
need to put them to use.

Joseph suggested that networking in college
is a major way to get in contact with potential
employers and improve social skills that come
into play during interviews and the application
process. «

“We also look foraclear, concise resume that
highlights yourmainpoints and best attributes,”

Joseph said. “Make it simplistic. You can look
well-rounded without listing everything you’ve
ever done.”

Junior Andrew Gentilcore, a mechanical en-
gineering major, puts greater emphasis on initial
presentation and meeting potential employers in
personthananything else. He said thatthe Career
Fairbeneﬁted himbecause employers provided
immediate feedback about whether he had the
chance of turning the meeting into a job.

“I got several job offers at the Co—Op Fair if

at Pitt last year, and one of them turned into a
paid summer internship,” he said. “I had already
submitted my resume to other companies [who
didn’t go to the Co— Op Fair] online and didn’t get
any calls back.” I

A EDITORIAL

 

cyberbullying
merits attention

Long before we became college
students, many of us lived in fear
of the bullies patrolling the school-
yard. Unfortunately, a recent sur-
vey shows we’re still susceptible
to torment, only in a much larger
and more—diﬂicult-to—police play-
ground — the Internet.

An Associated Press—MTV poll

' found that 56 percent of youths in

their teens and early 20s are vic-
tims of “online taunting, harass-
ment or bullying” ——_a 6 percent
increase from two years‘ prior.
Although the speciﬁc activities
denoted by each category of on-
line abuse remain unclear, what is
clear is that “cyberbullying,” as it’s
often termed, merits more serious
consideration.

Take, for example, the case of
Tyler Clementi, the Rutgers Uni-
versity freshman who leapt off a
bridge last year after afew of his
peers broadcast over the Internet
footage of him allegedly having
sex with another man. Had the
students realized their behavior
would contribute to his suicide,
they would doubtlessly have relent-
ed. Other teens — Megan Meier,
Phoebe Prince — have also ended
their lives following social-media
attacks intended as taunts.

Authorities, as well, sometimes
seem unaware of cyberbullying’s
potential psychological impact.
For instance, according to court
documents, after Prince hung her-
self in 2010, witnesses testiﬁed in

 

 

court that school administrators
knew about the harassment, but
did nothing to stop it.

This isn’t to say that absolute-
ly everyone doubts the gravity of
digital abuse. In fact, the U.S. De-
partment of Education sponsors an
annual conference on the subject.
But at least among students and
teachers, cyberbullying is all too
often dismissed as harmless.

The fact of the matter is, bul-
lying is bullying, no matter what
the medium, and administrators
should assign as much weight to
name—calling online as they do to
taunts in the classroom. If any-
thing, the former should be treated
as more dangerous: A 2o1o]ournal
of Adolescent Health study found
that verbal abuse is usually more
psychologically damaging on the
Internet.

If online taunts are anonymous,
a tech expert should still be able to
determine their source — virtually
nothing on the Internet, in fact, is
untraceable. Once offenders are
identiﬁed, they should be treated
with the same severity as “tradi—
tional” classroom bullies.

Cyberbullying — like its in-
person counterpart — might be
impossible to fully quell. But the
least we can do is treat the matter
with the same vigilance applied
to in—school taunting. Then, per-
haps, college students can venture
online without feeling scared or
vulnerable. 

 

THE STAMATTACK

 

Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

If all of Pitt’s buildings went “Trans-
formers” onusand became robots, and
students then elected a lead building,
which one would win?

In addition to revealing how lame
my imaginary scenarios are, the likely
answer — the Cathedral of Learning
— demonstrates that people vote for
stupid reasons.

At ﬁrst, the Cathedral might seem
like a sound choice: No other build-
ing," after all, is more ‘recognizable as
Pitt property It towers over Oakland,
remindingthe thousands in die vicinity
who’s boss. ‘ "-

The Cathedral’s size is matched
only by its majesty. John Bowman,
the chancellor at the time of its cre-
ation, asked architect Charles Klauder

to design a building that looked how
German composer Richard Wagner’s
“Die Walkure’ ’ sounded: forceful, beau-

tifuland permanent. And over8oyears
later, his vision remains intact — at
least from the outside.

When you compare the Cathedral
with its competition, who to vote for
seems clear. Would you choose the
sprawling, squatting contortion of
concrete known as Posvar? Would
you even consider Towers, which, if
theywere music, would sound like nails
on a chalkboard rather than a classic
opera‘?

No. But this is where we make our
mistake. Ultimately, abuildings princi-
pal strength isn’t its image but its utility:
the building’s ability to contain, move
and shelter people.

By these standards, the Cathedral
ofLearningis probably the worstbuild—
ing on campus. Infact, considering its
lines and crowded corridors, it might
be more appropriate to call it “the Ca-
thedral of Waiting.”

Think about the area surrounding
the building. Even the four street cor-
ners that encircle it are some of the

most diflicultto maneuver on campus.
TheBigelowside suffers fromtoo many
students, crushing each other to get
past leitturning cars and angry bus
drivers. Meanwhile, the Belleﬁeld side
is either a trapezoidal deathtrap near
the Music building or an awkward T
nearthe museumwhere you look back-
ward to go forward.

Compare this to Posvar, which
can be entered from Towers through
acovered bridge hoveringoverForbes
Avenue. It’s probably one of the ugli-
est things on campus, but it gets you
from A to B.

Once you enterthe ground ﬂoor of
the Cathedral, things get even worse.
The ceilings are so low that you can’t
even do jumpingjacks. And even ifthey
were higher, the throngs of people and
the doors that burst open at random
intervals would bowl you over.

Then there’s the waiting. The
doors are too small for two people to
ﬁt through comfortably, so you have

to waitfor one person to clearthe way.
Thereareneverenoughtables available
in the common areas, so you have to
wait for one to open.

_ And of course, we can’t ignore the
elevators, which cause the longest
delays in the building. The horrifying
metal cages move up inverted mine
shafts with the grace of a ballerina
choking on a gumball. It takes so long
to get up to the Honors College that
it might aswell be in a different time
zone. In fact,  there starts

As homely as it appears, Posvar is
the best robot-building candidate for
Pitt. While on the outside it might look
like a drunken toddler with a tank of

fundamentallyﬁincﬁonal. There areno
elevators that slow things down, plenty

Considering that everyone from

observed how important looks and

this column won’t change very many
opinions. The Cathedralwould

Despite the majesty of its exterior,
the actual usability of the Cathedral

Presidential candidate who projects
strength and swagger. He has awesome
campaign music, a celebrated history
and that quintessential Presidential

THE LYONS DEN

Channeling your anger, angrily

Kelan Lyons
Columnist

Stop punching holes in your wall

——' there are more effective ways _

to deal with fury.

We all have those moments
when we don’t quite know what
to do with our anger: after receiv-
ing a failing grade. on an exam,
for example, or while watching
Pittfootball. Accordingly, I’ve -
listed a few unorthodox coping.
mechanisms to help you feel the
collective joy that makes Pitt the
20th happiest university invthe
United States.

Go On A Trip

Take advantage of free Port Au-

‘ thority transportation! Becauseif

you’re" angry with everyone and
everything in Oakland, it’s best to
get as far away from your friends
as possible. Take a bus to the Andy

- Warhol Museum, or, if you’re of

age, to the Hofbrauhaus. Who
wants to talk about their prob-
lems and resolve their disputes
with friends when you can just
run away using public transpor-
tation?

Eat

Have the perfect body? Then
forget using the gym to relieve
your anger and do some hardcore
binge eating. As any recently sin-
gle 14-year—old can tellyou, some-
times eating a quart of Ben and
Jerry’s Rocky Road ice cream is
the best method for dealing with
frustration and sadness. Don’t
like ice cream? Try to consume
a large order of O fries or an en-
tire Sorrento’s pizza with ranch. ‘

I dare you to try to continue be-
ing outraged after you devour so
many calories that you slip into a
food coma.

Rant

If you’re really mad about
something, it’s always best to
put it into words. Loud ones. In
public. Annoyed with your boss
for yelling at you in front of all
your co-workers?" Feel free to
loudly explain what you would
do if you were locked in a room
with him, some batteries and a
tube sock. In addition to having
your rant featured on the Over-
heard at Pitt Facebook page, you’ll

- probably make the people around

you laugh at how ridiculous you
sound. Their amusement at your
frustration will make you realize
that you might be exaggerating
a bit.

Do Work
Though some may think it’s

difﬁcult to get work done when
you’re consumed with rage, I’ve

‘ found that anger can serve as a

solid motivator for homework.
Those of you who took the laugh-
ably easy general education class
Introduction to Psychology may
remember the term “sublima-
tion” — that is, the conversion
of frustrations or cravings into
socially acceptable activities. In
other words, that rage and ag-
gression can actually fuel your
motivation and allow you to get
some work done. Use that anger
and be productive! Head over to
the Cathedral and hit the books
before you hit someone. A

Watch TV

How can you stay outraged
while watching MTV’s “Teen

It’s-rarely a good idea to physi-

anger. Punching one of your par-
ents in the face because they just
don’t “get you” is usually not a
phenomenal coping mechanism.
Instead, you should channel that
aggressive energy into hitting a
punching bagwhile imagining
that you’re hitting your antago-

MOVIE REVIEW .

‘Moneyball’   hits it out
of the cinematic park

   
   

Cousy Sony Pictures

Brad Pitt as Billy Beane and Jonah Hill as Peter Brand give strong performances in this

Dan Law
Staff Writer
Moneyball
Directed by Bennett Miller
Starring: Brad Pitt, Philip Seymour Hoff-
man, Jonah Hill
A_ - . .

Rest assured, Oscar season is here.

Leading the way so far is “Moneyball,” the
big screen adaptation of Michael Lewis’ in-
ﬂuential yet controversial look into the life of
a small-market baseball club navigating the
treacherous landscape of a league dominated
by the likes of the New York Yankees and Bos-
ton Red Sox.

Brad Pitt plays the roguish and amorphous
Billy Beane, a big-league bust turned Oakland
A’s general manager. Confronted with the loss
of three rising stars and a payroll unable to
keep them, Beane is forced to create winners
out of undervalued — and inexpensive — ball-
players.

To do this, Beane plucks up Peter Brand (Jo-
nah Hill), an undervalued wtmderkind drudging
through his ﬁrstjob in Major League Baseball.
Through Beane’s charismatic drive and Brand’s
innovative approach to player evaluation, the A’s
shock the establishment and make the postsea-
son with a roster full of young talent, midseason
trades and waiver-wire pickups.

The screenplay, co -written by Steve Zaillian
(“American Gangster,” “Schindler’s List”) and
Aaron Sorkin (“The Social Network”), relies
largely on the underdog narrative, with much
ado about Beane’s unorthodox and thrifty
strategy for ﬁelding a winning ball club. The
more nuanced details ofbaseball sabermetrics
and talent evaluation are glossed over. Instead,

-' slow—paced and contemplative movie.

Miller opts for quick cutting montages of Hill
discussing his methodology with Beane and
players alike, giving the audience a digestible,
yet developed scope of the inner workings of
a professional baseball team. .

- Notably, Miller makes the effort to take
viewers inside closed-door negotiations.

_ Scenes involving Beane hustling on the phone ‘

and bartering with other general managers
are especially enjoyable and illustrate the daily
grind for an effective sports executive.

A Like a true Oscar contender of its’ kind,
“Moneyball” is slow, introspective and delib-
erate. The fast-cracking quips and rapid—ﬁre
dialogue so synonymous with Sorkin’s scripts
are traded for drawn-out-scenes of Beane driv-
ingapickup truck through industrial Oakland.
Miller marshals up numerous scenes of Beane
in solitary, stoic contemplation, allowing Pitt
plenty of time to convince the academy that
he is indeed Billy Beane, the champion of the
downtrodden and poor. Moreover, audiences
will ﬁnd it easy to cheer for Beane and Brand
as rogues ﬁghting the system and challenging
age-old wisdom and methods.

Despite strong performances, effective
directing and sharp writing, “Moneyball” suf-
fers from the lack ofan ending. In the ﬁlm’s
defense, Lewis’ book doesn’t offer much clo-
sure and poses more questions than it offers
answers. True to form, Miller and the writers
try desperately to compensate by attempting
to breathe life into a ﬁlm that grinds slowly to a
halt: The potentially exciting side story of the A’s
record-breaking run of 20 straight wins takes
an inordinate amount of time to play out.

By the end, existential phrases revolving
around “changingthe game” and shaking up the
establishment by “threateningthe way they do
things” are all the audience can chew on once
the ﬁnal credits roll. I

My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic

This is not your 1980s “My,Little Pony.”
The characters have been revamped into
relatable, cute and symbolic characters.
The premise is that in Equestria, ponies are
the dominant race and can be divided into

three different types: unicorn, pegasus and
land ponies. The other beings in the land are
all mythological creatures, usually dragons
and animals inspired by Greek myth. It
follows Twilight Sparkle and her friends,

‘who all represent one of the elements of

harmony, in Ponyville as they learn impor-
tant lessons about friendship. 7

With a smooth,,anime-influenced ani-
mation style, and a hilarious — and moral
—— plot, it’s hard not to like. a

The genius of “My Little Pony: Friend-
ship is Magic” has spawned a somewhat
unconventional audience in addition to
its intended demographic of young girls.

ALBUM REVIEW

Queens’ Das Racist releases first official album

Patrick Wagner
Stajfwri ter

Das Racist

Relax

Greedhead Records

Grade: A-

Rocks like: Diplo, Beastie Boys, MF
Doom

After releasing two free mixtapes that are
better than most rappers’ magnum opuses,
Das Racist faced a litmus test with their
debut album, Relax. ,

As the album’s cover attests, it literally
burns the couch —— a ﬁxture of previous
Das Racist mixtape covers .— on what they
did before.

Emcees Heems and K001 A.D. and hy-
peman Dapwell have moved Queens’ Das
Racistin a more focused direction. With
this effort, the group relies on its lyrical
complexity as well as its catchy wit and
lush musical production’. Das Racist creates
a mature effort that seems boroughs away
from the comical —— but still worthwhile —
“Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.”

Working with producers like Diplo
and El—P in addition to its own produc-
tion work, the group creates an impres-

sive variety of sound that is consistently
engaging and points to the band’s inter-
est in all things vintage and intriguingly
syncopated. “Brand New Dance” chimes
like a sizzurp—speeded» Santigold track,
the chanted hook giving it a particularly
ethereal but pop-like feel.

Heems comes roaring into “Michael
Jackson,” ﬁghting for supremacy among
the song’s electronic strings and heavy
bass. In the album’s ﬁrst single, Heems hits
“Michael Jackson” with an oratory force
he’s only hinted at before. “Medulla cre-
ate the moola / and me I just do the rumba
/ porque esta es la rumba,” he expels in a
burst, using a captivating sense of syncopa-
tion with his word play.

“Selena” sees some of the old lyrical
wit of the mixtapes — particularly on the

part ofKool A.D. — but the accessible talk— ‘

rapping of “Rainbow in the Dark,” which
is included on Relax, and other earlier fa-
vorites seems absent.

For those expecting “Who’s That Brown”
or “You Oughta Know” again, you’ll prob-
ably be disappointed by this more varied
approach. While the album hints at their
more lighthearted past, Relax moves Das

Racist into a future where no one will‘

doubt that they’re more than a comedy
rap group. I

Rocks Like: Bon Iver, Fleet Foxes

Apartment recordings

La-

Blessed Feathers is the kind of band that
exempliﬁes the low-budget sensibility and
wandering curiosity necessary to record an
album in the group’s apartment.

That’s the story behind Blessed Feath-

ers’ newest album, From the Mouths of the _

Middle Class. The band spent the winter
of late 2010 and early 2011 writing and re-
cording an indie folk album that will haunt
listeners.

The music itself isn’t eerie, but Blessed ,

Feathers has a way of writing simple, yet

stirring music using guitars, accordions and
banjos. Both the band’s instrumentation and
lyrics are minimal.

And it works. This album speaks of rest-

lessness, and most of the songs describe
treks through the country driven by a search
to satisfy an ambiguous desire. The ﬁrst
track, '“.By Song Through The Americas,”

illustrates this perfectly with the lyrics, “I _

took a trip across the Southern states / And I
felt the heat, sweat bead along my face / But
we’re lost in the woods / Trading thoughts

Later in the same song the band sings, “I
wish that I could hitch a ride / And pay my
bills at the same time.” The‘band’s chosen

' string instruments — particularly given

their association with wanderers — set the
mood and complement these lyrics per-
fectly. .0
On" another track, “Apple Blossoms,” the
singerjmerrily declares that there are “apple

4 blossoms in my hair.” Completing the pic- -

ture, the music imitates hand clapping and
picks up the pace to transport listeners to
a lively festival. The only problem with this
song is that it only lasts a minute and a half,
leaving listeners feeling unsatisﬁed.

Still, the album isn’t ﬂawless. _ During
“Somebody Else’s,” the group sings, “Think-
ing about love / somebody else’s,” but the last

syllables of the lyric slur together. If there’s ' A
‘a meaningful end to this lyric, it is lost. Un-

Pitt begins conference play, against South a

“Florida, gae plan to stay the same

Sean Corrado
Staff Writer

Perhaps for the ﬁnal time, the Pitt
football team will host its Big East
opener against South Florida on
Thursday night — and it won’t be
easy. .

 No. 16 South Florida has the mo-

mentum after they powered over
UTEP last weekend with a 52-24
victory, running their so—far—perfect
record to 4-0. Quarterback B.]. Dan-
iels -— a redshirt junior — shone as
hethrew for 202 yards and 2 scores,
while rushing for 130 yards and an-
other touchdown. Daniels led his
offense to a productive day of 575
total yards.

USF also remains the only Big
East team to defeat a ranked oppo-

' ‘Silent, as they took down Notre Dame

(then ranked 16"‘) in the ﬁrst week
of the season.

The Panthers come from the
opposite side of the spectrum. Pitt
(2-2) took its second-straight loss
after losing a fourth-quarter lead last
Saturday against Notre Dame.

Quarterback Tino Sunseri
couldn’t get things rolling for the
Panther offense. He managed a
season—low 165 passing yards and

(only one score on 30 attempts.]unior

Tiinning back Ray Graham failed to
make 100 yards for the ﬁrst time this
season, despite taking21 carries. The
offense totaled only 268 total yards
and converted 7 of 17 thi"" downs.

Thursday night, Sunseri and his

erianther offense look to improve

their play and execute their coaches’
game plan. .

“The main thing is to be disci-
plined enough to do what you’re
coached to do,” head coach Todd

,,,,Graham said. “That is our chal-

enge for [the Panther offense] this
week.”

Head coach Skip Holtz will stick
to his South Florida game plan in
order to push his Bulls to continue
their hot run.

4% “We have talked about playing to
a standard. Playing to our level, and
not to our opponents’ level,” I-Ioltz
said in a press conference Monday
morning.

Dion Lewis breaks into the open for a big run against South Florida two years ago . Pitt has beaten USF in -

USF has lost the last three meet-
ings between the two teams —— since
winning at Heinz Field in 2007 -
but a Pitt team that has struggled
through much of this season will
have to pull off a big upset to take
the victorywhen the two teams meet
Thursday night at 8 p.m.

According to Graham, Pitt’s of-
fensive game plan will not change
much for the USF game.

Sunseri will remain the starting
quarterback. Coach Graham reiter-
ated that Sunseri gives Pitt its best
shot at winning, and no quarterback
change is planned inthe foreseeable
future. However, freshman Trey An-
derson might see a series or two —— as
he did in the Notre Dame game —— in
order to gain some national-stage

three consecutive meetings, but the No. 16 Bulls are 4-0 this year.

experience against a ranked team.
Ray Graham will continue to
receive about 30 touches, the kind

of numbers he got before the Notre -

Dame game.

“The whole idea is to get the ball
to your best guy and we’re going to
do that,” Coach Graham said. “We
just need to be able to execute and
not become one—dimensional.”

According to defensive tackle
Myles Caragein, the Pitt defense will
have to work to contain Daniels and
his high level of play.

“That’s something we’ve been
talking about, especially up front in
the defensive line — keeping him in
the pocket,” Caragein said. “We’re
going to try and eliminate his big
plays by getting pressure on him and

try to rattle him.”

* Another inconsistency the Pan-
ther defense needs to correct is
its fourth-quarter play. Pitt’s two
straight losses have come from blow-
ing fourth"-quarter leads.

Caragein agrees the defense
needs to maintain its composure.

“When we melt down, it’s when
players try to make big plays and
they’re not doing necessarily what
they’re supposed to do, but they’re
trying to help the team out,” Car-
agein said. . '

Coach Graham is pleased with
the way the defense and the special
teams have been playing; however,
the high-powered USF offense will
give the Panther defense another
challenge. I

With the Big East. tournament '

one month away, the members
of the Pitt women’s soccer team
know they have to start winning
games now if they don’t want to
wait another year to contend
for the conference champion-
ship. ~ .

Pitt (1-7-4,-O-2-2,) is in last a

place in the Big East’s Ameri-
can Division after tying Rutgers
on Friday night and falling-to
Seton Hall on Sunday. Five of
the eight teams in each of the
Big East’s two divisions will

advance to the Big East tour— '
nament, which starts _Oct. 27. 

Pitt’s two points put the team
four points behind Syracuse,
St. John’s and Providence for
the final spot.

The Panthers hope to begin
their postseason push this Fri-
day against Villanova (4-6-2,
0-4). which sits in last place in
the neighboring National Di-
vision. The Wildcats have lost

three straight games. .

‘‘We’re only four points out
of third place,” senior goal-
keeper Kristina Rioux —— who
ranks ﬁfth in the nation with 66
saves —— said. “If we get a win
against Villanova, who’s also
struggling, then that will push
us forward.”

Head coach Sue-Moy Chin

doesn’t usually call her team’s *

attention to an opponent’s re-
cord —— particularly a losing
one. But it seems like a good
time to start, what with the
Panthers still searching for
their first Big East win and
heading into Friday’s matchup
against a Villanova team that is
also winless.

“It’s really the first time
our coaches have mentioned a
team’s record,” Rioux said. “But

Conference play opens the door for big upsets

‘I?
Donnie Tasser

Staﬁ’ Writer

Conference play in college football truly
begins with a bang this week. There are
ﬁg games galore and — as they always
do in college football — upsets are going
to happen. According to my “Upset-O-
Meter,” these are the best bets for upsets
that could screw up conference predic-
tions very early.
No. 16 South Florida @ Pittsburgh
The Bulls — led by athletic quarter-
back B.J. Daniels —— have looked terriﬁc
thus far this season, whereas Pitt has been
inconsistent, underachieving and look-
ing more lethargic than high-octane. But
the Panthers traditionally play the [Bulls
Yﬁigh -- Pitt’s won the last three in the
series -—- and Daniels has a history of
making mistakes. If this is the game the
Panthers finally decide to break out on
offense and play well — or at all — in the
fourth quarter, they just might be able to"
pull it off on national TV. ‘
Auburn @ No. 10 South Carolina
Without Cam Newton, this is obviously
not the same Auburn team that won the
National Championship last season, but

its billing as No. 10‘ either. The Gamecocks

are 4-0, but with a sputtering offense -,— ’

something we don’t see very often from

the opponent’s ground game and success-

will be whose ground game will prevail:

ously not the same, Auburn team that

season.   I  

goes for this game. -

No. 3 Alabama @ No. 12 Florid

No. 3 team is considered an upset, but I
don’t know if this one should even count,

UCLA @ No. 6 Stanford

Stanford — behind Heisman front-
running quarterback and consensus No.
1 overall pick Andrew Luck —— has been
nothing short of dominant on both sides
of the ball. The Cardinals are averaging
46 points per game while giving up only
9, and their defense allows only 36 rush-
ing yards per game. But that defense will
also be without its best player, linebacker
and pro-prospect Shayne Skov, who suf-
fered a knee injury last week and is out for
the rest of the year. UCLA, on the other
hand, averages 214 yards per game on the
ground, and is 2-2 on the year. This has
the slight stench of an upset.

No. 17 Texas @ Iowa State

Texas travels to Ames, Iowa, to face a
Cyclones team with a matching 3-0 re-
cord. The Longhorns have something to
prove after Iowa beat them lastayear in
Austin —- a loss head coach Mack Brown
called one of the worst in his career. But
I’m not sold O11'lIl‘l€ Longhorns’ three-
headed monster at quarterback, and Iowa
has played good football this season. 
Cyclones need to make a sltropng plea‘ to
other conferences sniffing around the
Big 12’s leftovers, and beating confer-
ence big-dog Texas would be a good way
to do it. ﬂ
