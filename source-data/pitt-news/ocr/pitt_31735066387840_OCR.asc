Brennan against campus police taking f1j€€ food

By Brendan Kevenides
Staff Writer

Pitt’s director of the public safety
department, William Brennan,
said that he will investigate
whether campus police grant
added protection to local
businesses which give them free
accommodations.

According to Walt Waters, first
assistant director of public safety,
he has warned officers not to
accept free food and beverages,
as it tends to lead to a mutual
obligation which is unfair to both
parties. He said that when he
walked the street as a police
officer, he was always leery about
excepting hand outs.

“I don’t believe anyone should
give or accept anything for free
and police officers should set a

Pitt makes tentative plans for North ‘Oakland dormitory

good example,” Brennan said.
“Also, if officers are spending too
much time in one place, that
should be corrected. I will look
into this.”

The practice of giving officers
free coffee and food is long-
standing in this area and is done
out of appreciation for the police,

according "to some area
businesses. But one
establishment, Mr. Donut on

Forbes Avenue, does it for safety
reasons.

“For 10 years, Mr. Donut has
been giving [the police] free
donuts and coffee as a protective
measure,” said store manager
Renae Sines.

She explained that if she did
not give officers free food items
she would have to spend more
money to hire a private security

. manager of

guard.

“You don’t want people killed
or robbed in your store,” Sines
said. “I want a cop inside.”

Waters commented that making
Mr. Donut off-lirnits to police
officers may be necessary.

Sines claims that most other
local businesses operate the same
way when it comes to giving
police free amenities". But
randomly chosen businesses did
not reiterate completely.

Mark Hudson }r., assistant
the 7-Eleven
convenience store on Forbes
Avenue said that he gives campus
police free coffee but does not
feel obligated to do so. He said
that he does it as a courtesy.

“I like [the officers] and they
seem to like me. Sometimes they
just come in to talk,” he said.

He did admit, however, that
the heavy police presence in his
store does act as a good deterrent
to crime.

Vice President of Student Affairs
at Pitt, Dennis E. Donham,
expressed disappointment that
Sines would feel obligated to
give hand-outs to police and said
that he disapproves of the practice
for any reason. .

“It's always been a running
joke about cops and donuts but if
she feels obligated, that’s/ her
problem," Donham said. “I don’t
know that she's afforded any
extra protection.” ‘

Roy Rogers, Forbes Avenue,
assistant manager Vince Murphy
said that his store does not give
police free food or drink. He said
that since he has,‘ a good
relationship with Pitt police, it is

an unnecessary practice.

“It is their job to help us if we '

need it. And they do help,”
Murphy said. 1

Sheetz, Forbes Avenue,
manager Dawn Dobrowolski said
that although the campus police
consistently help in keeping some
rowdy customers in line, she

would like to see them in her .

store more often. She explained
that although Sheetz has a policy
of giving police free coffee, many
of them do not take advantage of
the offer.‘ ‘

“Maybe if they knew about the
free coffee they’d be in more. ‘Pd
like that,” Dobrowolski said.

Crime statistics forjanuary 1988
to December 1988 showed no
significant difference in the
amount of crime committed in
the four stores.

stated Dean Briscoe, who confirms that
the facility will deﬁnitely not be an athletic

' building. . ‘

Other options listed in the project
outline include a “snack bar [that] would
be similar to the one located in the William
Pitt Union” and a “convenience store to
handle toiletries, candy, etc.”

The project outline states, “Dr. Donham

felt that this facility should be totally air— _

conditioned even though there would be
an increase in costs. He noted that the
William Pitt Union was renovated to
accommodate air—conditioning throughout
the entire facility." - I

“It will pay for itself,” Dr. Donham
said. “[The money] won’t come out of
students tuition.”

The building will be paid for by selling
tax exempt bonds which will be repaid by
the facilityiwhen it is available to house
students. The proposed dormitory

would be open to all students, regardless
of their year in school. Current residence
hall suites are bid on by students, and
those with seniority have the first
opportunity to claim the suites. The system
is based on the amount of years spent at
the university and the time spent living in
the dormitories.‘ s . a 
Donham said all plans and discussions
are tentative and are open to student
feedback. “We’re not sure what we can
and cannot do in this facility, but we are
trying to give students as much as we
possibly can. Students deserve to have
something nice,” he said.
“The idea is to get [the facilityl built,

then to continue renovation on the rest of I

the dorms,” said Briscoe who believes,
along with Dr. Donham that “this facility is
just the beginning of new and better
housing.”

Dean Briscoe defends the features that
the new building will have. She said,
“\Vhy build mediocre housing? Nobody
said that quality had to be spared [in the

Pitt festival to ‘Celebrate Diversity’

By Sumnne Sabol
Staff Writer

“Celebrate Diversity" festivities
began yesterday with opening
ceremonies and an international
fair on the William Pitt Union
lawn. ,

Pitt President Wesley Posvar
welcomed the crowd to “five
wonderful days of activities.”

In his opening address, Posvar
said, “Pitt is" an American
university, but also a tremendous
international university. Pitt has
over 1,500 international students
from 100 countries. So this is a
very diverse, rich, international
experience.”

Poet b. f. maiz spoke after
Posvar and told the audience,
“Globalism is a way of thinking
and acting in the 20th century
and beyond. It takes courage to
choose to learn about other
cultures, but in the process, you
learn more about your own
humanity.

“The family of humankind is

AALLLAAAAALLAAAAAQQQLAQAAALQALQAAAAAAAAA

one. There are many cultures,
but there is one race —— the
human race.”

After the opening ceremonies,
the International Fair was open
to the public. The fair featured
more than 40 student
organizations.

Courtney Ciambotti of the
Western European Club said that
although Pitt “is a cultural
university, many students are still
culturally ignorant. This gives
them a chance to expand on their
preconceptions of foreign
cultures.”

Trudy Singzon of the Pitt
International Student
Organization said, “I think that
it's important to be culturally
aware. This International Fair is a
good way for Pitt students to get
a taste of other cultures and some
of the clubs, as well as the
opportunities to study abroad that
are available.”

The PISO booth had ﬂags,
books and writings from other

countries available for viewing.
Other groups, like the Telugu
Families from India, sold ethnic
food at their booths.

The Hong Kong Student
Association sold Chinese good
luck posters and translated
English names into Chinese. A
student at the booth said,
“Everyone is asking about the
challenges [Hong Kong] is facing
in the future. We have a very
complicated culture and we like
having the opportunity to explain
it.”

Ying Ning of the Pitt Chinese
Club agreed. “Chinese people
are friendly. They want to share
the enthusiasm and make friends
with people around the world."

Pitt junior Alex Jaffurs was
impressed by the fair. “I think

people would get a lot out of 9

Red tape...

By Tammy Richardson
For The Pitt News

The Scene: Thackeray Hall

The Time: 3:00 p.m., September
12, 1989, otherwise known as
the ADD/DROP deadline day.

The Characters: Steve (a
freshman whose name has been
changed to spare him lifelong
harassment) and the university
staff.

I don’t need my adviser’s signature
to ADD/DROP, do I?”

The woman behind the desk
seemed far too involved with
tightening the bun of steel wool-
type hair that was sitting atop her
head to respond. Instead, she
yanked his ADD/DROP form from
his hand and began to process it.
All at once she stopped, looked
up at him for the first time,
discarded his form and snapped,
“Steve, don’t you know you can’t
use ink? You’ll have to do another
one!” ’

NEXT!”

As I watched poor Steve trudge
slowly away, destined to stand in
line again, I wondered if this was
an isolated case of Pitt's
bureaucracy at work. I quickly
realized that this sort of “red
tape” is not uncommon at all here
at Pitt. To whet your appetite a
little, I’ve compiled a few
bureaucratic horror stories that

else noticed that the Time
Schedule is totally useless without
the Course Description

probably also wondered why
the Time Schedule is available at
Thackeray, while the Course
Description paper can only be
found on the infamous 9th floor
of the Cathedral of Learning!

Second, I remember when I
lost my student I.D. last term, and
went to get a new one. I was

the card! Amazing.

Third, in honor of Steve and
everyone else who has ever come
up against Pitt’s terrifying wave
of bureaucratic red tape, I did a
little snooping around. In fact, I
think I now understand why,
even though you don’t need an
adviser’s John Hancock on your
ADD/DROP form, you still have
to go to that famed “9th floor of
the Cathedral of Learning” to get
one.

Cutting, college spending

What goes up must come down —— right? Wrong, but that
doesn't mean that it can’t be stopped from going up any
further.

And that is exactly the plan of action that educators have
suggested in the case of tuition. Almost every year,
universities all around the country raise their tuition. It is
not simply inﬂation that is occurring, it is the fact that
colleges know that whatever costs they incur during the
year can be paid by —— you guessed it — the students.

Hopefully, that is all going to change. A panel of
educators recently recommended that schools adopt
reforms that will curb the growth of their spending. It is
about time, considering that tuition has increased 10, per-
cent annually between 1980 and 1987. At that rate, only
the very rich could afford to go to college in the future.

Some of the reforms that are suggested are to close
underused campuses, set tuition rates for several years at
a time and to allow families to pay for their child’s
education over eight to ten years.

The cost of an education has become exceedingly and

unnecessarily high.over the years. These rising costs of

school have forced many good students to give up their
aspirations — the time has come for this to stop.

Censor in the Rye

Cries of censorship ring in the hallways of a California
school.

The classic novel by JD. Salinger, The Catcher in the
Rye, has once again been banned from a high school -
this time in Boron, California.

How and why can such a thing happen in such modern
times as these — an era in which people walk almost
naked on California beaches, just about anyone can call
a telephone number and hear an erotic message and
television shows have more violence on them in one night
that a normal person sees in a lifetime?

One “concerned” mother began to read this classic and
became so ﬂustered over the word “goddam,” (which
appears several times on page 36) that she did not even
bother to finish the book. That is why she began her
crusade to save the children from this particular book —
as if they do not hear much worse words and expressions

in the hallways in between classes.
' If the woman had bothered to read the book to.

completion, perhaps she would have seen some of the
social issues that this book so effectively deals with. But
then again, with the closed-mindedness that plagues such
people, it is doubtful that they will ever see the point that
such books try to make.

Ever since this book has been banned in Boron, the
waiting list at the public library is ﬂourishing. It appears

I that the best way to get high school kids to read classics

is to ban them— maybe English teachers everywhere can
employ this tactic.

Fine cuisine at convenience stores

For those of you who are on
Pitt's meal plan and in constant
search of gastronomic goodies
— or just an occasional good
meal —-- I have good news! You
don’t have‘to wait until Thanks-
giving for a decent fill of food.

Surprised? You shouldn’t be.
The solution to our cafeteria’s
wrath has been right here in
Oakland for years. I'm referring
to the convenience store, of
course. Breakfast at the 7-11,
lunch at Co—Go’s and dinner at
Sheetz does sound gross — but
think of the last time you ate in
one of Pitt's cafeterias. Is a Sheetz
hotdog, complete with onions
and relish, starting to sound pretty

 

good about now?

The suggestion that you con-
sume malnourishing food from
convenience stores was not born
out of passivity, but rather out of
the fire in my gut. If you have
ever had the displeasure of eat-
ing in one of our cafeterias, I’m
sure you’ve noticed that the stu-
dents who are dining (or dying)
rather resemble rows of people
on the commode. Their facial
expressions are nearly identical.
To be blunt, the food in our
cafeteria is so lousy that I wouldn't
even feed it to my neighbor’s dog
if for no other reason than the
fact that I don’t believe in canni-
balism.

Aside from their availability,
one notices right away that con-
venience stores offer a selection
that is wonderfully diverse from
that of the cafeteria. For those
who are sick, and tired of those
itsy-bitsy glasses that appear to
have been purchased from the
Smurfs, the convenience store is
waiting. No longer does one have
to ﬁll up 25 glasses in order to get
a sip of cola. At one store, you
can find a S6-ounce fountain drink

— a virtual two liters in a carton,
including ice. Drink one of these
babies every day andl guarantee
that you will come to know the
graffiti on the bathroom walls
better than the lyrics to “Happy
Birthday to You.”

Convenience stores can also
be a refreshing throwback to
home. One store in the area of-
fers toaster pastries that can be
purchased from an open box,
along with newspapers and
magazines that have been as

\’ thoroughly read as any on your

coffee table at home. In another
store, I even noticed a trash bag
by the door. I could almost hear
my mom telling me to take out
the garbage. E
Another refreshing character-
istic of convenience stores is the
educational aspect involved. Have

a you ever heard of Dr. Salk (the

man who discovered a vaccine
for polio)? Now it is possible to
eat the same coleslaw Jonas did

on the historic day of discovery. '

Not the same recipe, but the
actual same salad! Perhaps you
are curious about what Doritos
tasted like before the new recipe?
No problem, I’m sure your favor-
ite convenience store has the
original batch still on the shelves
— literally!

Convenience stores also ac-
commodate the indecisive eater.
So you can’t make up your mind
about which doughnut to eat?
Take your time to give it some
thought —— I'm sure the same
doughnuts will be there next
week, or even next year.

Let's hope that this column will
reach the desk of Pitt's food divi-
sion head honcho and inspire a
new plan of action. In the future,
perhaps meal cards could be used
at local convenience stores. A
variation of our current “choice”
plan, this would enable parents
to set their kids up for a gorge of
goodies by establishing credit
Too expensive a proposition?
Nah. Look at it this way: last
week I used my meal card (good
for nineteen meals) twice —

which means that my “meat sur-
prise” and bowl of Cocoa Puffs
cost mom and dad about $56.
Just think of all the Ho-Hos that
would buy. 

If you're reading this and just
happen to be a Pitt dietician, I'm
sure you ﬁnd my brilliant sugges-
tion perfectly revolting. You
probably fail to see that a bag of
Fun-Yuns anda 44-ounce Coke
mixed with Sprite beats a crappy
old salad any day. Hey, enough
of your patronizing attitude al-
ready! At least I frequent these
bastions of biodegradable car-
tons -— when was the last time
you actually ate in one of our
cafeterias, pal?

Nutritionally, I see no reason
why the convenience store should
be unacceptable. If Uncle Sam
can call ketchup a vegetable,

why not call a 32- ounce con- v 

tainer of Sprite sipped with a
Pixie Stick nutritious? Besides,
what's better — Pitt cafeteria’s
soup of the day, or a Slushpuppy
and a Milky Way?

Objectively, it’s hard to say that
the convenience store isn’t a
viable alternative to the cafeteria.
They are open at all hours, cheap
and replete with variety: Ding
Dongs, King Dons, Zingers,
SnoBalls and Big Daddies next to
cases upon cases of Diet Coke.
The administration should cer-
tainly consider this writer’s sug-
gestion very seriously.

By now, the thought of eating
regularly at convenience stores
shouldn’t seem half bad. Com-
pared to the cafeterias here, it's
not hard to look good. On this
note, I would only hope that
students do not decide to let this
new discovery keep them far sm
going home for Thanksgiving --
with Aunt Wilrnadide coming
from Cleveland. The convenience
stores at home will all be open;
and who’s to say Fun-Yuns and a
44'-ouncer aren't “stuffing?”

Trying to keep a friendly attitude is important in life

Imagine that you are walking
down Forbes Avenue toward the
Cathedral of Learning. As you
pass the 7-Eleven, you look ahead
and see a girl to whom you were
introduced several times last term.

The closer you get to her, the
more you think, “Does she re-
member me?” You and she had
only chatted brieﬂy a few times,
but your paths had crossed more
than once. As you ponder these
facts, she nears and passes you.
You both look the other way.

 

Did she see you?

Are you a loser?

Or were you both thinking the
same thing?

I wonder how many times a
day this scenario occurs on Pitt’s
campus. I also want to know
how many, out of all of the times
it occurs, both people remem-
bered the other — but were too

» self—conscious to be the one that

initiated the “hello."

I'll admit I have no right to
speak against this, for I too have
engaged in such behavior. But I
still find it annoying, and maybe
a little rude as well.

Why don’t we say “hi” to each
other? If I would have forced
myself to acknowledge the girl
from last term the first few times

I'saw her in September, we would
always exchange hellos without
hesitation thereafter. Then, if I
ran into her at a party in late
October, we could talk, and
maybe (as corny as it sounds)

, become friends. But if we didn't

say “hi" those first few times we
saw one another, then when we
ran into each other in following
months, she would assume that I
do not remember her. I would
assume that she does not remem-
ber me. I would avoid her at the
party in October.

There is nothing wrong with
being friendly. Admittedly, Pitt is
a large institution and therefore
does not necessarily reﬂect a
warm, loving atmosphere. There
are days when each and every

one of us has had to walk from
our dorms or apartments, all the
way across campus, and not
recognize a single soul. The urban
atmosphere may generate a cold-
ness that makes us believe we are
out here on our own -— that no
one has the time or the desire to
remember us.

“If we wanted a cozy, super-
friendly school,” says my room-
mate, “we would have chosen
small private schools in the
mountains.”

This is true. Each one of us has
made the decision to live with the
ano'nymity that comes with ur-
ban life. Many of us enjoy that
feeling from time to time — in-
cluding me.

But no one enjoys the feeling
that they’ve been forgotten. No
one likes to. have to look the
other way when they see some-
one they recognize.

Pitt’s large size and urban at-
mosphere offers us the opportu-
nity to meet an unlimited number

of people with extremely diverse

and varied backgrounds, while
simultaneously generating an
atmosphere that makes it very
difficult to do this. We can make
the task much easier for one
another by acknowledging that
we remember each other. It’s as
simple as saying “hi.”

Jodi Polaha is a columnist for
The Pitt News.

When my friend “Stanley”
invited me to his apartment party
last Friday, I expected to be en-
tertained. But even I was not
prepared to digest the strange
characters and events that would
unfold like an Umberto Eco
novel before my eyes.

I don’t drink alcoholic bev-
erages for personal reasons. It
was with this clear-headedness
that I stood on the fringes,
watching the carnival play be-
fore me. By 1 a.m., I realized
that I could easily milk a column
from this display of sophomoric
debauchery and bohemian atti-
tudes.

My partner in sobriety was
“Stanley”; since it was his apart-
ment that had come under siege,
he wisely chose to oversee the
shenanigans rather than become
a full-time actor in this opening

night of revelry.

In my three years plus of
being an undergraduate — span-
ning two different universities —
I’ve noticed that each party, no
matter how big or small, still has
the same cast of characters.

Over by the stereo is the
idiot, begging to be noticed by
his peers, who sings to every
song that comes on, acting them

 

out with a facial expression that
reminds one of cholera.

Sitting around a table playing
drinking games are four misspent
youths. There goes a quarter in
Otto’s cup. Damn! Now he’s
forced to down the frosty brew

that he so despises. “Why me?”,
he ponders.

Sprawled out in the hallway,
drunk, drooling and unconscious,
is “The Frosh.” It’s not his fault,
he had to drink  there were
girls to impress.

Girls  hmmm  The only

reason for going to a party is to

meet them. Leaning against the
couch is the .nerd (ahem) with
the iced tea in his hand. Right
next to him is the dark—eyed
beauty, the type you-usually find
in Sicily. He makes a jab at
conversation:
T LLE - So  what’s your name?
$1; - Brunhilda.
_I_lE_ - So  do you know
“Stanley?”
SE1 - No, but my boyfriend
does.
ﬂ - Your boyfriend  he’s
probably way over at USC.

Party types stay the same, in party after party

_ﬂI_I§ - No, he’s the one over
there bench-pressing: the keg.
What did you say your name
was? , '

ﬁg - Will you look at the
time? I gotta go.

As I made my way to the
bathroom line (iced tea goes
through me like a locomotive), I
noticed another friend of mine
giving his sixth straight pseudo-
nym for the night. I warned him

about Brunhilda. He told me not

to worry, he used my name.
Thanks, pal.

By 2 a.m. the party had eased
into neutral. Most of the wreck-
ing crew had left, the keg was -
I hate this term —-' “kicked” and
the iced tea was leaving a weird
taste in my mouth. For the next
20 minutes or so I could actually
talk to someone without scream-
ing above the stereo. The party

ended for me when this girl
said, “I know “you. You’re the
idiot who writes for The Pitt
News. It'll be a year too late if\
you never write for that rag
again!’

So with that thought, 1 sur-
rendered and departed for my
home in Tower C. At least the
people there respect me. Well,
I had just gotten to my hall
when my intoxicated neighbor
said, “Hey, Dude. We just left,
your name and number on
some strange woman’s door.”

Maybe I could still make V
that last bus to Scranton. Evi-
dently the two of us deserve
each other.

Pledging is at fundamental pom‘ of knowing the true value of brotherhood’

Reading The Pitt News over the

last couple of weeks has been an‘

even more unpleasant experi-
ence than in the past. It is unfor-

tunate that this piece of yellow_

journalism is one of the most
read college newspapers in the
country. These so called “jour-
nalists” are both unprofessional
and unethical, and are void of
any kind of objectivity. It is no
secret that The Pitt News is anti-
fraternity, and for that matter,
anti—Greek, but what does any-
one on the staff really know

about the subject? It is evident‘

from the editorial in the Sept. 7
issue, “No Real Need For Pledg-
ing” and the cartoon by Mr.
Condron in the Sept. 12 issue, the
answer to the previous question
is nothing.

It is a common myth that pledg-
ing equals hazing, but this is just
that, a myth. It is unfortunate that
The Pitt News is helping to rein-
force misconceptions that fresh-
men, and the majority of non-
Greeks have about pledging and
the Greek system, especially
when they do not know whereof
they speak. Pledging does not
equal hazing.

In my fraternity we do not
haze! (Right now I see people
saying, yeah sure, but it is the
truth!) In 1985 Sigma Alpha Mu
was refounded at the University
of Pittsburgh with two main goals
in mind: recruit good men, and
NO hazing. The reason for this
no hazing policy was a serious
one. One of our" eight refounders
had a friend killed in a hazing
incident at another university,
and he vowed that he would not
belong to an organization that
supported such behavior. When
he had a chance to refound Sigma
Alpha Mu, and realized that a
brotherhood could be formed
that was not rooted in hazing, he
did so, and set a standard for
Sigma Alpha Mu at Pitt that has
continued and will continue into
the future. I cannot speak for
other fraternities on this campus,
but from what I know about
them, the implications that they
haze are also wrong.

The pledge period in a frater-
nity can be one of the most
educational, enjoyable, and
rewarding experiences a Greek
can have in his undergraduate
years. The purpose of the pledge

period is to learn about the his-
tory of the fraternity, about the
Greek system, and form the bonds
that enable one to call another
individual “brother.” When I call
one of my fraternity brothers
“brother,” I do not use the term
lightly. I feel a similar bond with
him as I do with my biological
brother. A fraternity brother is
more than just a friend. This is not
the kind of bond that can be
formed in a mere seventy-two
hours. A fraternity without a

 

pledge period is not a brother-
hoodat all. It is just a social club
if time is not allotted to form the
"bonds of brotherhood, the most
integral part of a fraternity.
With rush ending on Sept 14,
this letter is too late to open any
potential Greek’s eyes to the
realities of the Greek system for
this term’s rush. But hopefully
non-Greeks will realize in the
future that the Greek system can
 beneficial in forming a strong
sense of brotherhood, social ties,

and in the development of lead-
ership skills. Non—Greeks should
not believe everything they read,
particularly form individuals as
biased against the Greek system
as The Pitt News staff, whose
opinions have no basis in fact.

Drinking laws should stand

There was a question posed in
the Wednesday, Sept. 6 issue of
The Pitt News. This question
asked, "What harm is there at
serving alcohol at fraternity par-
ties?” ,

It is easy to forget sometimes,
but, . in this state, it is illegal to
drink under the age of 21. Yes, it
is true, anyone serving alcohol to
a minor or anyone under the age
of 21 who is drinking is breaking
the law.

College kids are going to drink,
but do they have to? Is it manda-
tory that to be accepted in col-
lege, a person must automati-
cally be able to drink a keg each
weekend? Drinking is not all there

is to do at college. Oh, but then

again there is always the alterna-
tive of going out and buying
drugs. They are against the law
too, but granted, it is an alterna-
tive to a beer at a fraternity party.

Perhaps these “budding alco-
holics” can find better things to
do with their weekend, like at-
tend an Alcoholics Anonymous
meeting.

If parties are the only fun thing .

to do on campus, there is some-
thing very wrong. How unfortu-
nate for the Pittsburgh police and

. the university to bust these un-

derage drinking parties. Who do
they think they are, trying to do
their job or something?

No alcohol at fraternities is a
good idea if they are going to
serve minors. It is good for the
fraternity house, which is liable
and for the campus overall.

Alcohol should be looked upon
as the dangerous drug it really is,
not some social drink. There are
responsibilities tied with alcohol
that should not be forgotten.

Currently, insurance premiums

Judd-Hill said NOW based its

fact that “women are not driving

that the number of miles a person
drives has any 0 proportional
relationship to the amount_ of
insurance claims a person
submits.” NOW appealed to the
Commonwealth Court, which
unanimously upheld the
Insurance Commission's findings.
The state Supreme Court refused
to hear the case earlier this year.

Although the case dealt with
adult unisex rates, a victory for
NOW would have blocked
insurance companies from raising
the rates of young women drivers.
In March 1989, the insurance
commissioner ordered that youth
rates, too, be calculated on a
unisex basis.Judd—Hill stated ﬂatly
that “Unisex rates are unfair.”

In addition to allegations that
Foster “falsiﬁed the court record,”
Niebrzydowski, in a letter to
Governor Casey, stated that by
misrepresenting NOW’s position,
Foster is “pitting rural and urban
drivers against each other to help
insurers block needed reform.”

Dugan said the NOW statement
is “a reﬂection of a long-standing,
fundamental disagreement in
philosophy” and that the
Insurance Commission “supports
equality of men and women in all
lines of insurance. “

As for NOW’s demand for a
retraction, Dugan said the
commissioner may reply‘ in
writing to NOW, but the Insurance
Department remains adamant that
there has been “no
misrepresentation in this case."

  The Artists of Athens: ‘Southern Expressionism‘

By John Jacobs
For The Pitt News

Three-dimensional collages,
paintings of fragmented bodies
and chairs made of chicken wire
are among the works in The
Amer: ofAt/aensexhibit on display
attthe Carson Street Gallery in
Pittsburgh’s South Side.

The exhibit, titled “Southern
Expressionism,” features the
work of john Cleaveland,Jennifer
Hartley, l.illian King Heard, Larry
Hopewell, Charles Ratliff, Jill
Schultz and Ross Shapiro, all of
Athens, Georgia.

The rural home of the
University of Georgia, Athens is
a cultural center which has
produced the musical artists
R.l’..M. and the 15-523. Andrew
Van Sickle, a Cincinnati artist

who briefly lived in Athens, says,
“Athens has become a creative
mecca which will last at least the
next 10 years. [Athenians] are
very informed, not only in art but
in political and humanitarian
issues.” Athens’ blend of
countryside and intellect has
resulted in art which Van Sickle
has termed “eccentrically urgent.”

You can sense the eccentricity
and urgency in the “Southern
Expressionism” exhibit. One of
llopewell’s pieces, “There is no
Respite,” is a boxed collage which
features a drawing of a loaded
shotgun on its glass front. Seen
through the glass are four pictures
of Brigitte Bardot, and behind
this is a picture of a pilot entering
a biplane. Written on the box is
the phrase “Security ls Beyond
Evaluation.” Hopewell says

inspiration for this piece comes
from “the [survivor] mentality of
Athenians,” and added, “Brigitte
Bardot is a survivor!”

Other pieces are far less
“urgent,” but no less stimulating.
Jill Schultz says, “There are no
single messages in my paintings.
I mostly concentrate on sensual
aspects.” Schultz’s paintings of
nude subjects in pastoral settings
are sensual indeed. She also
feels that the competitive, artistic
environment of Athens has
improved her personal work.
“Creativity spawns creativity,” she
says.

The unique Athenian style is
on the verge of shedding its
“folkish” label and becoming
more popular. This is due in part
to the success of the musicians,
and the growing popularity of

other Georgian artists like Howard

John Candy falls short of comedy in Uncle Buck

By Matthew Myers
Staff Writer

' §1"he lucrative successes ofjohn
Candy and John Hughes have
largely depended on their
instinctive abilities to make us
laugh. Among his 30—plus ﬁlm
appearances, Candy has been
noted for his characterizations of
the tacky and uproarious ne’er-
do—well whose sheer haplessness
exudes genuine wit.

Hughes, in an attempt to break
away from his own self-inﬂicted
high school image, has asserted
himself as an adult filmmaker
with hits like SbesHaw'ngaBaby
and Planes,‘ Trains, and
Automobiles (starring Candy).
Together for the second time,
they seemed destined for great
comedic heights, but their recent
effort, a little ﬁlm called Uncle
Bucle, seems to indicate
otherwise.

Candy stars in the title role as a
fun—loving bachelor who is
entrusted with the care of his
nieces and nephew during a
family crisis. Undaunted by his
lack of domestic life knowledge,
Buck Russell plunges ahead with
the household: chores,
improvising his own solutions to
using common home appliances.
In addition, he is forced to deal
with his rebellious teenage niece
Tia, played byjean Kelly, and her
hyper-hormonal boyfriend
n_amed Bug (Jay Underwood).

Essentially, it is the stuff of
most Hughes plots, with lots of
gags and obvious knee—slappers,
but we are stuck with an ending
that is pure commercial pabulum.
Not only does Candy’s bi g—hearted
Buck character find love and 2

reunited family at the film’s end,
but he also illustrates how hokey
Hughes’ high-concept
conclusions really are; he
incessantly and arbitrarily
employs his endings to provide

his audiences with some sort of

philosophy-of—life jive that is all
too sudden and excessively
melodramatic. It is a movie that
starts out as one big, broad
premise of comedy and finishes
with bittersweet tenderness that
no intelligent person will buy.
One of the biggest examples of
this is Chanice, the ‘estranged
girlfriend of Candy, played by
Amy Madigan, who seems like

she is simply there to fill the void
of Buck’s love life. She is airnost
entirely one-dimensional, pushed
into the background of the story,
having no style or depth
whatsoever. She is so
underdeveloped, that we are
never given an explanation as to
why she is so attracted to this
overweight slob. All we know is
that she owns a tire dealership
and wants to bear Buck’s children.
At the end she is reunited with
him after a mistaken—situation
scenario reminiscent of “Three’s
Company.”

This wouldn’t be so bad, except
that Amy Madigan has done

better. Much better. She fared

Dreams and gave what I think is
the best performance of her career
in Places in the Heart.

And then there’s Candy, who
has proven himself to be one of
American film’s most comedic
actors in movies like Splash,
Stripes and Volunteers. His Uncle
Buck tries unsuccessfully to
delight the audience with sight
gags and violent slapstick, but all
that’s left is a lot of dead space
between jokes and even the sense
that Candy is actually struggling
to get the yucks out of an
obviously botched script.

Buck

Continued from page 11
one of the most sought—after child
actors in Hollywood.

I‘ Uncle Buck assumes we are
amoebic sirnpletons who have
never seen a good comedy before.
Endlessly, the audience is led by
the hand to every joke. In fact,
Hughes seems to want to fulfill
all of our expectations. Why has
Huges let his audience down?
Maybe because Uncle Buck is
Hughes’ first film under his new
mu1ti—picture deal with Universal
Studios. In that case, economy
outweighs comedy and only
studio executives will laugh. at
the former, probably all the way
to the bank. 

Although the comedy side of the
formula is not clearly evident in
watching the film, there are a few
funny moments stuck in the machine,
most notably the scenes with Candy
and Culkin together. But even those
good scenes are supplanted by the
predictable dialogue and bad acting
by most of the cast. ‘

It’s almost like seeing a sit—com,
and one can easily see this ﬁlm
becoming a spin-off TV series in the
vein of “Roseanne” or some other
God-awful thing. Let’s just hope that
Hughes fulfills his contract with
something more thought provoking
than this mainstream garbage "next
time.

Brains
Continued from page 12

LP was the self-titled cassette-
only release on Roir in 1982.
Critical acclaim heightened for
the Bad Brains, eventually
attracting Ric Ocasek of T he Cars

8 who produced the 1983 release

of Rock for Light.

By now the Bad Brains had
garnered a following that was as
equally diverse as their style. The
Brains could be as powerful as
they were melodic. Live, there
was no stopping the seething
rasta fury that the band created.
H.R. often seemed so enthused
and out of control that fans would

- . . . . .

wonder if he was about to
implode into a musical black hole,
taking the surrounding energy
with him.

There were times when the
band would have trouble keeping
up with H.R.’s lyrics, which he
could spit out faster than a demon
rendering curses. (Check out ‘'1
Against I,” and “Coptic Times” as
examples.)

_After a short parting in 1983,
the band regrouped and worked
towards 1987's I Against I LP,
released on SST Records. This
album was so indicative of the
Bad Brains’ style that fans and
critics alike were overwhelmed,

for “Best Hardcore Band” at the
2nd Annual New York Music
Awards.

1988 brought Bad Brains Live,
which, although it was musically
solid, failed to capture the feral
essence that the Bad Brains deliver
so well in person. '

Most recently, the band struck
a deal with Caroline Records and
continues to work on their next
release, Quicleness, which is

scheduled for release sometime

this month.

’If there is a comedian today
who is as skilled as Lenny Bruce
at probing all the ludicrous and
hypocritical aspects of our society,
then it has to be Bob “Bobcat”
Goldthwait. .

His rantings as a mentally
deranged psychopath have
brought him roles in the Police
Academy series, Burglar and
Scrooged, as well as several
comedy shows taped exclusively
for HBO and Cinemax.

Best described as a punk»-rock
casualty gone awry in the acid
subculture, Bobcat shouts,
slobbers and sweats through his
hyperactive oration on the
stupidities of life.

Bobcat bases his commentary
on tongue-in-brain reactionism
as seen through the pop culture

impersonation of U2’s Bono is
very impressive.) Although he is
often Very critical, he constantly
plays devil’s advocate,
condemning an institution one
moment and defending it from
the audience the next.

Bobcat covers everything from
natural disasters to his personal
antics to politics, always taking
the bizarre approach to humanity.
He is a demented fury, the perfect

3 days   of the Panthers

Pitt women ’s tennis team is off to 3-0 start

Monday:
vs. CMU

By EJ. Borghetti
For The Pitt News

The women’s tennis team
made its debut Monday
afternoon ‘in smashing style by
drubbing the Tartans of Carnegie
Mellon University, 8-1.

Leading the charge were the
top two singles players, Erika
Devins and Julie Lo Prinzi. This
being their first collegiate match,
the talented freshmen netters
described themselves as
“apprehensive” and suffering
from “a severe case of
butterﬂies."

Evidently they used their
nervous energy well. \ They
chalked up 6-1, 6-0 victories
over Mary Beth Ashengaugh and
Beth Cavanaugh, respectively
in’ their singles matches.

Lo Prinzi used her shot
placement skills well and didn’t
render a single point until the
sixth game of the opening set.

“I don't really feel like I was
tested today,” said Lo Prinzi.
“Obviously, I don't want my first
match to be against someone
who is going to turn pro next
year, but in the future, I'm
looking forward to longer,‘ more
competitive matches.”

Devins utilized her advantage
of a stronger serve and forehand
to dispose of her opponent

“CMU isn't a particularly strong
team but this is a good warm-up

Tuesday:

vs. IUP

By Sean Hellman
For The Pitt News

The Pitt women’s tennis team
defeated Indiana University of
Pennsylvania at the Panthers’
home courts yesterday, 7-2.

All of Pitt’s top three seeds
came away with wins.

Despite suffering a groin injury
a week ago, No. 1 seed Erika
Devins beat Susan Christ 6-2, 6-
1.

“My game »is rusty,” said
Devins. “I took a week off for
the injury. I was slow and my
serve is a bit rusty."

Pitt's No. 2 seed Julie LoPrinzi
downed Heidi Sjoberg 7-5, 6-2.

LoPrinzi fell behind early, 2-5,
but came back to win the next
five games and 11 of the last 13
games.

“Lwas shaky in the beginning
(of the match), but I got my act
together," said LoPrinzi. C

Devins and LoPrinzi also
teamed up in doubles to defeat
Susan Christ and T ammy Reeher
6-1, 6-1.

Other Pitt victories included
No. 3 seed Lisa Kinney over
Reeher 3-6, 6-4, 6-3; Heidi Price
over Rene T angretti, 6-4, 6-3;
and in doubles, Kinney and
Gwen McIntyre over Sjoberg
and Lori Patterson, 6-3, 7-6 (7-
5).

Pitt's only losses came in No.
4 and No. 6'singles. McIntyre

Wednesday:
vs. Duquesne

By Jim Lakely
For The Pitt News

It’s hard to tell how far the
women’s tennis team will go,
but you can't ask for more than
the team’s 3-0 start. The women’s
tennis team dominated their
latest victim, the visiting
Duquesne Dukes, in
Wednesday’s match.

Pitt took early control of the
match with a clean sweep in the
doubles competition.

Erika Devins’s powerful
groundstrokes and Julie
Loprinzi’s aggressive, thrashing
net play were too much for
Duquesne’s Valerie Ferritti and
Stephanie Kartsonas, as Devins
and Loprinzi won 6-3, 6-1.

Gwen McIntyre and Lisa
Kinney of Pitt won a tough
battle with Lynne Colbeck and
Kamini Weeratne of Duquesne,
6-4, 6-3. In the third doubles

match, Pitt's Heidi Price and-

Chris Orie had no trouble
knocking off Susan Faust and
Maria Hevia of Duquesne, 6-5,
6-5. ' ,
Devins and Loprinzi continued
their winning ways in singles
play with victories over Faust
and Kolbeck, 6-0, 6-1 and 6-3, 6-
1 respectively. Kinney and
McIntyre were not so fortunate
in their singles matches.
Unforced errors against their
opponents led to defeat It was

N o. 1 Notre Dame meets No. 2 Michigan Saturday

By Geoff Moskowitz
Staff Writer

There will be a hint of January in
the air Saturday (3:30 p.m., ABC-TV) when
No. 1 Notre Dame travels to No. 2 Michigan.
Michigan coach Bo Schembechler said
mat this is the biggest opener he can
remember.

Notre Dame 27, Michigan 24

Michigan has had quarterback
problems similar to Pitt’s. The difference is
Michael Taylor, a ﬁfth-year senior who
broke a collarbone nine games into_ last
year and is recovering from a sore shoulder.
ﬁre pressure on Taylor will be immense.
A Schembechler team has never lost to the
same opponent three consecutive times,
but more importantly a possible national
title is at stake.

Notre Dame is a one-point
underdog despite their higher ranking.



 BC 28, Rutgers 21

Despite a disappointing loss to

Pitt, Boston College should be able to
rebound against Rutgers, who can't seem

_to find the win or loss column (0-O-2).

WVU 30, South Carolina 20

South Carolina quarterback Todd
Ellis will spend the majority of this season
on his back. Major Harris will keep West
Virginia rolling and his Heisman hopes
alive.

PSU 48, Temple 10

Happy Valley will be eager for
blood this weekend. Penn State will be
taking its anger out on one of the nation's
20 worst teams, Temple. Jerry Burndt’s
Owls won't be ready for prime time until
next year.

Syracuse 35. Army 24

Syracuse may be even better than
its No. 1 1 ranking indicates. Army's coming
off a 9-2 record and a bowl bid. Look for
them to do better against lesser opponents.

Colorado 31, Illinois 17

The second best game of the
week matches No.8 Colorado against No.
10 Illinois. Colorado's giving the Illini 5 1/
2 points. Take the points, but look for the
Buffaloes to stay unscathed.

Auburn 35. Southern Miss 21

Auburn started the season with a
scrimmage against Pacific. Southern
Mississippi should be a more formidable
opponent. Southern Miss is not scared by
the Top 10 and should cover the 16 1/2
point spread.

Arizona 35, Oklahoma 34

The biggest upset of the week
will take place in Arizona Stadium. Despite
Oklahoma's high-power rating, Arizona
should be able to pull this one out, maybe.

Iowa State 21, Minnesota 17

Iowa State and Minnesota will
provide more excitement from the Big

Eight and Big Ten Conferences. Both
teams should finish in the middle of their
conferences, making for as tough match-

up.
BYU 42, Navy 13

Brigham Young will successfully
beat up on Navy and the rest of its
mediocre schedule as usual.

Ohio State 31, Oklahoma State 21

Oklahoma State should be able to
give Ohio State trouble during the
Buckeyes’ home and season opener, but
won't.

Virginia 24, Georgia Tech 14

If Virginia is able to come down
from the clouds after last week, it should
handle Georgia Tech just ﬁne, considering
that Tech is off to a slow start and is
predicted as another of the country's 20
worst.

Odd ends from the National
Football League:

Most Overrated Coach --
Marv Levy, Buffalo Bills. With
superstars like Cornelius Bennett,

P Jim Kelly, Bruce Smith and Shane

Conlan on the squad, Kim
Basinger could most likely lead
the Bills to the AFC East title.
Come to think of it, Kim could
probably lead them anywhere
she wanted. Levy’s Kansas City
teams of the late ’70s and early
’80s were miserably boring, as is
the Buffalo offense of today.
Most Underrated Coach —
Jim Mora, New Orleans Saints.
People have quickly forgotten
that only three short seasons ago,
the Saints were still mired in that
modern-day tarpit known as New
Orleans Saints tradition. They are
now a very serious contender to
win the NFC. Mora worked
wonders in the shabby USFL.

Most interesting analysis of the NFL imaginable --

Tirnmy Smith, former Washingtoni

and San Diego running back.
With the 1987 Redskins, Smith
rushed for a Super Bowl record
221 yards against Denver. He
became a plan-B free agent in the
spring, landed with the San Diego
Chargers and is currently

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Thursday, September 14, 1989

Bengals unanimous pick over

Editor's Note: Each weele Sports
Editor Chris Bosale, Assistant
Sports EditorMtke Rampa and a
guest prognosticator will predict
the results of NFL games

Chris Basalt:
Last Week 11-2

Dallas at Atlanta: Be serious.
Why even play this game? Ok if I
have to pick one of them, I’ll say
Dallas.

Detroit at NY Giants: The
Giants looked impressive on
Monday Night Football. The Lions
haven’t looked impressive in eight
years. Take the Giants.

Houston at San Diego:
Houston got blown out last week,
but they were up against a far
better team than the Chargers. I
like the Chargers’ uniforms, but
they just aren't a good football
team. Houston.

_ Indianapolis at LA Rams:
Dickerson against his old team,
or his‘ old team against him?

’ Dickerson will get his yardage,

but the Rams will win.

LA Raiders at Kansas City:
Neither team is good, so it's
another tossup. The Raiders have
some talent, and they won for me
last week, so I’ll stay with LA.

 MiamiatNewEngland: Miami

lost a game they had all but won
last week against Buffalo, and
the Pats almost blew a 21-0 lead
to the Jets. New England will
hold on and win this week in a

high-scoring game.

Minnesota at Chicago: The
Bears proved last week that they
are still a good football team, but
as I said before, the Vikes are
unbeatable.

New Orleans at Green Bay:
New Orleans will go 2-0 this
week, only because they played
the Cowboys last week and the
Pack this week. The Saints will
falter when they play a real
football team.

NY Jets at Cleveland: I
promise I won't make any jokes
about Cleveland's game last week.
The Jets made a good comeback

last week, but the Browns will

make it 2-0.

PhiladelphiaatWashington:
This game used to be easy to call,
about four or five years ago. The
Eagles are vastly improved, but
I'm going with the ‘Skins.

Phoenix at Seattle: Phoenix
is 1-0, but they only beat the
Lions. Seattle is 0-1 and on their
way down, but they’ll even out
their record this week.

Pittsburgh at Cincinnati:
Sorry, I can’t take the Steelers
again, especially in Riverfront
Stadium. Look for the Steelers to
score their their first points and
gain over 100 yards total offense,
though.

San Francisco atTampaBay:
San Fran will win. Tampa is
improving, as is Vinnie, but they
still aren't good enough..

a lot better when he came back to
win the doubles with Garrard.

The victory has given the team
a feeling of confidence going
into this weekend's Big East
Championship in Weekapaug,
Rhode Island. Dieffenbach said
his team was getting tired of
playing each other, and this match
helped make the team more
competitive.

Dieffenbach feels that
Rosenthal, who is the number

. one player as a freshman, should

fare better over the weekend. He
said that he became more
aggressive in the second set as he
began to feel more relaxed.

will consider the Steelers as good

a team as the Bears tips me off
that the Bengals will come out
smokin’. Just can't take the black
and gold this week.

San Francisco at Tampa Bay:
‘Niners all the way.

Jim Tezak
Guest Prognosticator

Dallas at Atlanta: Coach
Jimmy Johnson has the Cowboys
on the right track and will get his
first NFL victory this week, if
anyone really cares.

Detroit at NY Giants: Giants
WR Odessa Turner is no longer a
secret after last week’s impressive
game against a tough Washington
secondary. New York goes 2-0.

Houston at San Diego: Jim
MacMahon is hurt for Chargers.
Surprise, surprise! Even if
MacMahon can play Sunday,
Oilers should win_ big.

Indianapolis at LA Rams: It
will not be a pleasant
homecoming for Erik Dickerson.
Rams will win.

LA Raiders at Kansas City: If
Raiders get a good game at

quarterback, their offense is as
good as anyone’s, even without
Bo Jackson and Tim Brown. I’ll
take the silver and black.

Miami at New England:
Dolphins can put up points, but
as usual will simply just give up
more. Look for Tony Eason to
open up the offense as Pats win
at home.

Minnesota at Chicago: The
Bears lost twice to Vikes last year
and are out for revenge. Soldier
Field is a great place for them to
get it.

New Orleans at Green Bay:

Even with all the weak games
this week, this is probably the
only one I really don’t care about.
Go with upset-rninded Green Bay
for the hell of it, but hope Tony
Mandarich gets his head kicked
in.

NY Jets at Cleveland:
Cleveland is not as good as they
have been the last few years, but
Browns still have enough
weapons to beat the Jets.

Philadelphia at Washing
ton: I don’t like Buddy Ryan, so
I'll take the ‘Skins in this one.

Phoenix atseattle: Both teams

are pretty bad and going nowhere.
Seattle wins a yawner.
Pittsburgh at Cincinnati: It
doesn’t get any easier for
Pittsburgh after last week's 51-0
embarrassment. Steeler fans can
only look forward to hockey
season. Bengals, obviously.
San Francisco at Tampa Bay:

Bucs QB Vinny Testeverde will.

pass for 500 yards as Tampa Bay
gets the W. Just kidding. Niners
should put this game out of reach
early.
