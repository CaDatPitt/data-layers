UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Plans Protest March

by IVAN ABRAMS

“We hope ‘to attract 400,000
people,” said -a spokesmen of
the Nat-ional Mobilization ‘Com-
mittee about this S*atuI‘da_v’s
March on Washington. The
march is organized around the
theme “Confront the Warmal:-
ers” -and is intended to indicate.-
to the government the massive
quantity of opposi-tion to the
Johnso-n administrations war on
Vietnam.

In a format siinitlar -to the

(3 march in New York last Alp-ril.

15, the march will begin at 1].
am. in the area of the Washing-.
ton Monument. From there the
rnaircliers will cross «the Potomac
River to Arlington where they
willl assemble in the parking lot_
of the Pentagon for a rally and
a. series of speakers. At the close
of the rlailly, those paSrtici'pants
who wish to commit civil dis-
obedience will do so by sitting
in -at the Pentagon itself.

The idea of this second mo-
bilization was originated by the
Student Mobilization Committee
in their Chicago conference this
pas-t May. The National Mobili-
zation, meeting in Washington

the idea and suggested that for
greatest impact, - Wa shin gt 0 n
should be the mobilization’s tar-
get.

Until last Wednesday it was
thought that the government
would refuse to issue the neces-
sary parade permits to the Mo-

. bilization Committee. However.

with several organizations which
had only peripherally support-
ed the march came to its de-
fense because of the civil lib-
erties issue at stake, the Wash-

opingwn police backed down and

' issued the permits.

Last April, Pittsburgh sent a
cont-igent of 400 marchers to
New York. For Saturd-ay’s
-march, the various peace organi-
zations in the city hope to dou-
ble local iparticispation. Towards
this end, busses have been char-
tered which will leave from the
Friends’ Meeting House at 4836
Ellsworth Ave. at 5 a.m. Satur-
day. Round trip fare is $10, and

.- the march,

 

aAgainst Vietnam War

the busses will return before
midnight Saturday.

For University students inter-
ested in marching on Washing-
ton, Students for Peace will ac-
cept reservations and money at
its literature table in the ground
floor CL. Students for Peace
can also provide m:ore informa-
tion on the exact routing of
on the speakers
scheduled -to appear at the raliy,
and the exact nature of the civil
disobedience activities.

“Opposition to the war is es-
pecially widespread on college
campuses,” declared a represen
tative of the Student Mobiliza-
tion Committee at the Un-iversi
ty last week, “and attendance at
the march should indicate this
high -level of dissatisfaction with
the ' governments policies.”

The University’s state-
relatedness was the main
topic of discussion on Col-
lege Forum, a WTAE radio
public discussion program
Sunday night at 8 pm. The
three panelists were Lind-a Gold-
stein, editor of the Pitt News;
Ken Frederick, president of Stu-
dent Government (SG); and
John Meyers, president of Dru-
ids.

“Aliocations to the University
should be kept out of partisan
politics,” stated Miss Goldstein.
referring to the “agonizing wait-
ing period” the University ex-
perienced in obtaining its state
funds.

As -a possible explanation for
the end to last year's “waiting

MobilizationCommittee WT AB Radig Panel R

period,” Miss Goldstein suggest-
ed that “last year was an elec-
tion year.” However, “this year
is not, so both parties can now
give full vent to their penchant
for making political hay out of
issues which could -be decidedly
unpolitical.”

Speaking in favor of state-re
latedness, Frederick stated that
many Pennsylvania. students
could now afford the expense of
an institution such as the Uni-
versity. He maintained that af-
fiiliation with the state is a
“community service that the
University of Pittsburgh owes
to the city.” -

Other advantages, stated ‘Fred -

erick, were funds that are more
easily available for facilities, for
the Liberal Arts areas, and for
extra-curricular minor sports.
He realized, however, two dis-
advantages: “the ‘disproportion

last winter by the members of
the Liberal Arts Cabinet to stu-
dents enrolled in distribution of
studies courses in the School of
Liberal Arts. .

The course evaluation impar-
tially presents the comments
and reactions of University stu-
dents to the various Distribution

the Cabinet that a registranf;

course selections by knowing
the opinions of other students

Many students fail to broaden
their academic bases because of
their fear of unfamiliar sub-
jects out of their major ﬁelds of
interest.

“If you know _how to use it,”
stated Marc Spiegel, chairman
of -the Liberal Arts Cabinet.

between in-state and out-of-state
tuition and the political impuliica
rtions.” As an example of po-
litical -irnzplications, he cited the
transfer of Panther footbah
games from Pitt .Sta'dium to the
planned North Side Stadium. He
saw a danger in that “now the
legislature can tell -us where
and how our extra-curricular ac-
tivities are run.”

Meyers, an out-of-state stu-
dent, also protested the differ-
ence in tuition and said that the
repercussions of the difference
are severe. He gave such schools
as Wisconsin, Berkely, and-Miclr
igan as examples of less expen-
sive state-related schools. Refer-
ring to the 92 per cent of Penn-
sylvania students in this year’s
freshman class, Meyers asked it
the University realized the im-
portance of a cosmopolitan uni
versity and challenged _the 0f-
ﬁce of Admission’s opinion that
this ﬁgure if not detrimental.

All three panelists agreed that
the ratio of out-of-state to in-
state students was an impor-
tant iss-ue. They felt that'expos-
ure to different points of View
is an integral part of the educa-
tional process. The majority of
the telephone calls, however, re-
flected the opposite point of
view——-Pennsylvania should take
care of its own.

The panel also discussed the
steps that students were 
in response to the problem of
state-relatedness. The Pitt News
is supporting a Univers'ity-s!pon-
sored off-campus housing pro-
gram. In additiorn, the SIG has
passed a bill asking the reduc-
tion of out-ofstarte tuition.

In regard to state allocations
for the University, Miss Gold-

stein commented tha “our Uni-

versity has become a. political
football. No one of either party
in the legislature is wiling tol
budge.” Frederick expressed the
need for a “master plan for
state-related schools.” He placed
the only hope for solution in
the hands of Dr. David H. Ku1*tz-
man, state superintendent of
public education.

The panel ‘reviewed several
other ‘educational problems, in-
cluding the University’s grading

system. Frederick called the V

pass-I-ail program in Liberal
Arts a “step in the ringlhrt direc-
tion,” "wthile Meyers criticized
the discrepencies of grading in
the distri-buti-on courses.

Hassel at Troy State College
Revolves Around Censorship

Troy State College claims
that censorship has been
erased from the duties of
the school administrative
officers. Former editor Gary
Dickey is not convinced,
though.

Last spring when college
editor Dickey stood up for
the night of freedom of expres-

 

sion, he was put down, and then
out, by the administna-tion at
Troy State.

The battle began when Dickey
rose to the defense of Dr. Frank
Rose, president of the Univer-
sity -of Alabama. Dr. Rose hat‘.
refused to exert censorship on
a magazine called Emphas '87
—World in Revolution.

“The magazine ‘contained ex
cerpts from speeches by Bettina
Aptheker, an avowed Marxist,
involved in student demonstra-
tions at the University of Cali-
fornia and black power militant
Stokely Carmichael,” according
to Randolph Pendleton in a UPI
release. Neither spoke in the
lecture series at the University
of Alabama.

“Rose was criticized by legis-
-lators for permitting student
fees to be used to pay for a
magazine containing articles by
such people,” noted Pendleton.
He replied that the publication
was intended -to give both sides
of the issues.

“The University feels that cen-
sorship is a violation of free-
dom of -the press and freedom

.of expression,” Dr. Rose said.
“Before I co-mipromlise the integ-
rity of the university or -of my-
self, I will resign.”

Dickey’s defense, an editorial
entitled “A Lament for Dr.
Rose,” was snuffed by faculty
advisor Wallace Waites, who re-
ports to Troy's president, Ralph
Adams. Waites said the editori-
al violated Dr. Adams’ rule that
the newspaper could not criti-
cize its owners, the State of
Alabama.

Dickey refused -to obey W'«aites'
directive to run a substitute
editorial for the Rose lament.
Instead he Carrie-d the headline
he had originally planned, and
then emblazoned the word “Cen-
so-red” across the otherwise
blank «space in which the edi-
torial was to have -appeared.

Later, when Dickey tried to
register for the fall term, he
learned that he was barred from
the school. The reason, said the
official, was “his in-subordina-
tion in disobeying W'aites.”

Dickey took his case to court
with the aid of Attorney Morris

Dees, chairman of a publishing
company.

Dees stated that he thought
“somebody ought to step up
and represent this person’:
rights, especially in Alabama
where our governor has been
talking so much about constitu-
tional -rights.”

Dickey’s case won a decision
upholding a college editor’s
right to freedom of expression.
US District Judge Frank John-
son, who rendered the decision,
stated, “A state cannot force a
college student to forfeit his
constitutionally protected right
of freedom of expression as 2
condition to his attending a state
supported institution.”

paper, Ellek Seymour, has been

by Dr. Adams to restore the
image of the paper.

Seymour stated, “Mr. Eﬁuchan

the editorials in the ﬁrst edi-
tion of the paper were critical
of Judge Johnson, the Mon?-

frequent targets for Wallace

Mail Service Employees
Need Student Cooperation

W. L. Hopkins, supervisor of the University Mail Service,
called the handling of University mail a “cooperative venture be-
tween students andmail room employees."

Hopkins said that the mail room supplies two distinct serv-
ices: handling of the faculty and business mail and the handling
of the dormitory mail. In order to avoid delay in receipt of mail,
all dorm student; are asked to follow this form of addressing
envelopes:

John Doe

The elimination of “University of Pittsburgh" from the ad-
dress will provide students with quick and more efficient service.

Hopkins also asked that all

 Pitt Ski Club Invites

Student Participation

One of the fastest growing organizations on campus is

the Pitt Ski Club.

The club provides interested students with numerous
opportunities each winter to go skiing. The $5 membership
fee covers the skier’s transportation expenses for all club
trips. It also enables him to attend other club activities,

which include guest speakers,
special ski movies, a preseason
conditioning session and the an-
nual dance.

i.’ Club members are also grant-

ed substantial discounts at most
of the ski resorts in the West-
ern Pennsylvlania area. The re-
duced rate is especially valuable
for the beginning skier. For a
minimal fee, the skier is pro-
vided with a full day of skiing,
equipment rentals, -and a profes-
sional lesson. In addition, mem-
bers in the club who .-are quali-
ﬁed instructors are able to assist
both beginni=ng and advanced
skiers.

This year, under the leader
ship of President Ralph Sgam-
"ma, the club is sponsoring an
inter-club competition day, fea-
turing contests for all classes of
skiers.

Every Saturday during the
ski season the club sponsors a
trip to one of the resorts in the
area. An annual week-end trip
is one «of the year’s ‘highlights.
In previous years the ski week-
ends have been spent at Blue
Knob, Pa., and resports in up-
per New York State.

Officers for the coming year
are: Ralph Sgamzma, president:

a chance to fall on your face

Most of our top people have at one time or other.
The experience is enlightening. That’s why we make
such a big thing of it.

We put plenty of responsibility on our new people.
Some stagger a little. Others buckle at the knees. Then
we try to shore them up, but we don’t take the load off.

After a while (With considerable effort on their
part), they gradually learn to handle the job. Then we
usually add more work. We ﬁnd people grow fast this way.

Of course, it’s risky. There are some scary moments
for management (they tend to grey hair and baldness
at an early age). But, they remember they were given -
the chance to fall on their faces too. So they resist the
temptation to come to the rescue.

If you’re looking for a chance to fall on your face,
we’ll give it to you.

Page 4 — THE’ PITT NEWS — Wednesday, October 18, 1967

Governor Raymond Shafer castigates the Democrats for the legis-
lative stalemate on appropriaﬂions, while the Democrats single out Shafer
as the sole reason for the deadlock. One fact is undisputed: state gov-
ernment is virtually ground to a halt as both sides continue to denounce
one another.

In Pitt News interviews with state legislators the point is repeat-
edly made that ‘there is -a key difference between last year’s deadlock
concerning University appropriations and this year’s: state government
was at least moving then, but virtually nothing is being done now. No
one in either _party has encouraging words about the immediacy of a
solution to the appropriations stalemate. It is a simple matter of the
‘Republican leaders not having enough votes to pass their program and
the Democrats being so dissatisﬁed with the sum put forth by the Re-
publicans that they refuse to vote for Shafer’s tax package as it now
stands.

Democrats contend-that the Governor’s budget can be cut from
approximately $300 billion to nearer $225 billion. Shafer insists that the
allotted sum of $300 billion is mandatory for carryting out the state’s
programs. We certainly do not have access to all of the facts and ﬁgures
that our elected officials possess. However, we do believe that nothing

Men’s Council

A Study in Cooperation

by David Ehrenwerth

  Editorial: The Stalemate Continues

justiﬁes not having reached a suitable compromise by this time.

In our own particular case, the University, following the lead set
by Temple and Penn State, was forced to borrow money to meet its op-
erating experiences. The interest rate on these loans is ﬁve-and-a-half
per cent, but we are told that in all probability the state will reimburse
the universities for the interest money. However, this is a poor rationale
for the state failing to meet its commitments on time.

Legislators repeatedly remark that absolutely nothing is being
accomplished during the few days of the week they are in session. Even
leaders of both parties, who are privy to the closed-door sessions in this
issue, say thhere is no immediate solution in sight.

We hope we can take their words with a grain of salt, as we want
desperately to believe that action is being taken. For it is not a pleasant
sight to View the entlire process of state government go awry because
of the failure of our elected officials to reach the compromise that is
their obligation to obtain. \

Last year the battle did not last nearly as long. But last year was
an €leCti011 Year. This year is not, so both parties can n-ow give full vent
to their penchant for makling political hay out of issues which are de-
cidedly unpolitical. Let us hope that in the election next year the voters
remember this year. .

THE CONCEPT of a
group representing the en-
tire male student body has
always been considered
Worthwhile. Men’s Council’s
problem has been one of de-
ﬁning its structure, duties,
and powers. Now, thanks to
the oooperatrionof many or-
ganizations, MC is undergo-
ing a broad reorganization.

Three groups on campus
have previously represented
segments of the male stu-
%(e"I11ri".S: I/nter-Fraternity

ounbil, lVl‘é'ﬁ’§ D’(‘>'ﬁ“n C’6‘1i'i‘i-
cil and the Commuter As-
sociation. Only together do
they represent all men. Thus,
it is through these organiza-
tions that an All Men’s Coun-
cil can be formed.

Many programs beneﬁcial
to all men are the responsi-
bility of Men’s Council. These

include Orientation, Fresh-

man Ca.mp, Upperclass Advi-
sor Program, Selective Serv-
ice Forums, Transfer Days,
and Career Conferences. It
is only proper that the peo-

ple who plan these projects

should truly come from all
areas of the male population.
To this end, Men’s Council

will now be composed of ﬁve
delegates from each of the
organizations mentioned
above. This system, in addi-
tion to being representative,
will facilitate communica.-
tions. Men’s Council will be
able to serve as a forum
where important issues can
be aired; obviously it can be
an advisory instrument in
legislative matters.
BEYOND THIS, MC will
provide a Judicial Review.
Board for all men. The IFC
Boafd and the newly plan-
ned MDC boards do not have

the authority to hear the

majority of offenses. Conse-
quently, most students must
. be sent directly to the Dean
of Men. This is a major inno-
vation. For the ﬁrst time,
men will be able to be judged
by their peers.

An overriding goal of the
Council will be to establisli
a tradition of the type of
man Pitt produces. Hopeful-
ly, MC projects will enhance
the male stude-nt’s education
and insure that he leaves
the University a mature in-
dividual. What sounds ideal.-

come reality.

The fundamental ‘belief of
MC is that all men should
work together for their com-

mon beneﬁt. The committee
which is planning the reor-
ganization is a preview of
this. We are indebted tc->
many people. Ed Stack, IFC
president; Terry Gordon,
MDC president; and Ron-
Cowell, former president of
the Commuter Association,
have given Me1i’s Council
tremendous cooperation.
These leaders, and the or-
ganizations behind them, are
truly responsible for our ad-
vances. Further, we are
grateful to the Student Gov-
dent Recognitions Commit-
tee for their advice and for
giving us the opportunity to
prove ourselves. Clearly, this
interaction is basic to the
new role of Men’s Council.

REALISTICALLY, THE role of the Student Govern-
ment should be that of a student who is keenly interested
in the welfare of the student body. Unfortunately, there
are some current SG senators who don’t adhere to this
precept. . _ 

It IS not very difficult for the spectator at a SG Senate
meeting to become dismally aware of the senators who are
not at _all interested in student issues. They are more inter
ested in personal issues.

This writer was. dismayed, last week, when one sena-
tor badgered the chair on points of sheer banality. His was
a relentless attack that served no purpose except his own..

. THIS SENATOR thought that it was his duty to at-
tack the chair.on every point that was discussed. He chal-
lleﬂged the chair on procedural point after procedural point.

e result of _these challenges was to put the minds of spec-
tators and his fellow senators to sleep, .

,1‘? 1_S _T10t qulte fa-11", however, to hurl comp-lete blame on
one individual senator. The whole Senate (the members pre-
Sent} at the meetlflg), f0F instance, agreed that there was
a vital need for more student involvement. Yet the sena-
tors present failed to realize that their attendgfnce record
wasindeedshameful. Perhaps some of the senators don’t
realize what student involvement really is.

Essentially, the members of the Senate don’t under-
stand what their roles are. Of course, they do realize the
prestige of the Senate, but they fail to utilize this prestige.

Offer Religious History

by JOHN CAYWOOD

An inconspicuous and forgotten subject here at the
University has been the history of religion. About 40 years
ago, the secretary of the university, a Presbyterian minister,
gave a few biblical courses, but he didn’t have the time to
devote to teaching the subject within a program. The sub-
ject was dropped when he retired in 1934.

Rev. Raymond F. Brittain, a graduate of both the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania and the Pittsburgh-Xenia Theolog-
ical Seminary, joined the University’s history department

in 1936. He was soon asked to
teach courses in the history of
religion, which he has been do-
ing full--time -ever since. He re-
ceived hlis M.A. in 1937 and his

Ph.D. in 1946, both from the
University in religious educa-
tion.

Dr. Brittain currently offer;
ﬁve courses. Religion and Man's
Cultural Heritage can fulﬁll
part of «the social studies dis-
tribution and regularly has an
enroillment of 75 to 100 students.
The other four courses, Old Tes-
tament, New Testament, Near
East - Mediterranean Religions
-and Three Monotheisms, usually
-have between 30 and 40 students
per class.

Referring to the courses, Dr.
Brittain says, “Our purpose is
not to convert, but to illumin-
ate. . . . The students ought to
get an exposure of religion that
transcends sectarian 1ines.” He
also noted that the courses are
taken by “people who have had
religious training but are con-
fused, and by people withou.t
religious training who want to
know what it is all about.”

Dr. Brittain also spoke of a
pre-m:ini's-teriall major in religion.
'I1here have been as many as 20
students at a time -in this pro-
gram, which cuts across depart-
mental lines. These students
take Greek, music, social-ogy,
and psychology courses that are
not usually offered in semin-
alries. This is necessary to ﬁll up
the 36 credits required for the
major, since the History of Re-
ligion Department only offers
15» credits.

Dr. Aharon Kessler used to
teach here part-tirne, «adding an-
other six credits to the program,
bu.t he had to be released in the
recent financial crisis. Other
part-time instructors could be
available through, faculty ex-
change programs, and there are
many possible sources. for full-
time professors.

Dr. Brittain’s courses have
had good support from the stu-
dents for a long time, and he
feels that they ought to be of-
fered courses in Christian ethics
and contemporary religious
thought, both of which he has

neither the time nor the back-
ground to teach.

He also pointed out that many
other secular schools, Penn State
and the University of Pennsyl-
vania, for example, both have a
religion department and a full-
time religious supervisor and
co-ordinator. Since the chap-
lain"s post was d.ropped in the
early ’50’s, the University has
neither of these.

Dr. Brittain will be on sabbat-
ical next term, and plans to vis-
it the Near and Far East to in-
crease his familiarity with orien-
tal religions. While he is gone,
Dr. Howard M. Jamieson, Jr.
currently dean of students at
the Pittsburgh Theological Sem-
inary (PTS), will take over two
of Dr. Bri-ttain’s courses.

Dr. Jamieson did his under-
graduate work in history at Mon-
mouth College in Illinois, where
he became interested in archeo-
logy. He was ordained a minis-
ter in 1943, and, like Dr. Brit-
tain, received his M.A. and his
Ph.D. from the University in re-
ligion education.

iPTS since 1955, he has been
giving courses -in archeology as
well as in more usual ministeri-
al subjects. He has worked in at
least ﬁve archeological excava-
tions in Jordan and Israel since
1957. .

His. archeologi-cal experience
has brought -him -in close con-
tact with the Jordanian Mus-
lims that worked the sites. This
has given him, as he puts it, “a
chance to see what Islam means
to the man on the street, or the
man behind the donkey.” This
willwadd an extra dimension to
his teaching of the Three Mono
theisms course, which covers
J udla.i-sm, Chrilstianity and Islam.

mass peace rally in Washingtor-,
Saturday.

The sparse number who Wait-
ed on the steps of the United
Ministry Church, eventually

reached about 50, since the torch ‘

was a half-hour late. But by the
time the torch did arrive, the
number of people attached to
the processional had grown con-
siderably, having just marched
pass the University quadrangle.
Biegert spoke enthuasiastically
in front of the Mellon Institute,
saying to the group who had
gathered that many of them
were different in some respects,
but united in conviction, they
could work actively for peace.
“The course of ‘peace is a dim
one,” he spoke. But it was as-
serted that their ﬂame is not go-
ing out. “We would raitlher have
a hard peace,” he said, “than an
easy war.”

The conviction of the speaker
seemed to be a ﬁrm one. Speak
ing in behalf of the followers of
the torch, he declared “to all
men, as long as nations and peo-
ple use technical skill for des-
truction and ruin, that long the
torch will stay lit.”

Finally, just before a smaller
to-rch was lit from the larger,
the speaker p-rotected. “We will
not cop-out or drop-out.” And
some ﬁve minutes after the
torch arrived on campus, it was
lead away toward Washington.

that their pa-rticipation in the
demonstration was in protest to
not only the Vietnam war, but
to all wars.

There was a woman, a French
citizen, who joined the march in
protest of the United States’
position in Vietnam. She said
that she felt that this was every-
(.ne’s problem, as she followed
the procession as it lead away
from the University.

Those who had gathered in
protest of the United States in
terven-tions, bombings, wars, et
al, were opposed by a small con-
stituent of Young Americans for

mimeo-graphed sheets reading,

The reaction .to this literanture _ ‘S

was varied. Many laughed, some
became irritated. Often the
sheets reached the gvround,un-
read. It was apparent that the
group had ‘rallied for the pur-
pose of prortesting. As was evi-

people, the members of the
group had already made up
their minds, and had come out
to show it.

participated said that coming

Panthers’ Practice Spirited

_ There was a difference in Dave Hart. At practice he
was jaunty; His step had more bounce to it. A smile period-

ically creased his face. That’s

what happens after a Win.

The Panthers will try and make it two ‘in a row this week
against Miami, but H-art doesn’t think it will be an easy task.

“We’ll have to do What we did
explained.

“This (Miami) is a much bet-
ter football team than Wiscon-
sin. They were ﬂat the first cou-
ple games, but they seem to be
coming into their own.”

The injury jinx which has
hounded the Panthers all sea
son seems -to be abating some’-
what. Right now, according to
Hart, the only doubtful starter
is linebacker Ed Gallin.

“We’re looking very ‘hard for
linebackers,” Hart said. “We’re
even trying some offensive peo-
ple there.” Among those tried
out was -fullback Mike Riakle
wicz.

Although neither of the sopho-
more fullbacks compiled impres-
sive rushing statistics against
Wisconsin, Hart is well pleased

with their play. “I can’t tell you ’

how well Gary (Cramer) has
done. He’s so dependable. His
blocking against Wisconsin was
almost ﬂawless. Jeff Brown is
running right behind him. It’s
close there.”

Brown began -the season as a

he probably wishes he didn’t.
 watching his West Vir-
ginia freshman team get de-
Vvoured by the Cubs, Evans said
“Cindrich and Weston (Lloyd,
who else?) did a great job,
.,Oindrlch in particular.” Evans
"went on to call Ralph the best
varsity prospect on the frosh
team.

 

 
 
 

    
 

   
  

  

   
  
  
   

  
  
   
  
 
  
  
   
  

 

“It was just an average game,”
aid Ralph. “We could have play-
ed ‘better. I was using the wrong

-eys, but the tackles kept nail-

ing the guys before they got to

 

me.” The Cubs, held the Little
Mountainners -scoreless except
for -a safety. -

-If it is -true that the WVU
backs were downed before reach-
ing Ralph, perhaps it was for
the best . . . their best. “I like
to hit,” «Ralph ch-uckled. “I like
to hit a lot.”

That is why Ralph was put.-
zled at the Big 33 camp last
-summer, before the game with
Texas. “We lacked something.
We had big buy-s, but -they were
slow and -they lacked desire.
They didn’t want to hit.

“When I came here, I experi-
enced a new thing. Everybody
has desire and everybody wants
to hit. This is a much ‘better
team than the Big 33.” ’

There is a lot of pressure on
the frosh. They are expected to
win them all. That includes this
Friday against Penn State. “It’ll
be a real tough game,” Ralph
said. “They’ll be up for us. We

How high is “a. little bit high-

Ralph broke his hand in the

He refused to give up‘, insist-

Wrestling for two periods with s
the broken hand, he squared the

time; two more minutes of pain.
With six seconds left, Ralph
lost. “I -grabbed his jersey and

He really does like to hit. ~

SCHOLARSHIPS
BY CIIMPUTER

Last year $30 million in college schol-
arships went unclaimed —— because no
qualified persons applied . . . because
no qualified persons knew of them.
- Now ECS engineers and educators
have programmed a high-speed com-
puter with 700,000 items of scholastic
aid, worth over $500 million, to permit
students to easily and quickly locate
scholarships for which they qualify.
o The student fills out a detailed, con-
fidential questionnaire and returns it to
ECS, with a one-time computer-proces-
sing fee of $15. In seconds the compu-
ter compares his qualifications against
requirements of grants set up by foun-
dations, business, civic, fraternal, re-
ligious, and government organizations.
and prints a personalized report to
the student telling him where and when
to apply for grants for which he qual-
ifies. Thousands of these do not depend
on scholastic standing or financial need.

Lion Defense
Bigger Than
Cub Linemen

When a freshman football
team has a defensive line

that averages 6’3” and 23.0
pounds it -is reasonable to ex-
pect their opponents to be small-
er. The Cubs boast the above
statistics, but Frid'ay’s foe, the
Little Lions of Penn State, is
bigger.

. “Penn State,” warns assistant
coach John Rosenberg, “has one
of the best freshmen teams that
they've recruited in the past 15
years, and surprisingly, they’re
bigger than we are.

Still the Cubs will use the
same defensive strategy that
they employed in their first
game against WVU, with one
exception.

“Bill Beinecke will start on de
fense instead of offense,” ex-
plains Rosenberg. He will add
more weight to the line.”

Beinecki, a 6’4”, 238pound re-
cruit from Youngstown, Ohio,
wil probably join Howiard Broad-
head (6-5, 245), John Stevens
(6-3, 230) , Bruce Hark-iewicz (6-3,
215). and either Tom Porreca
(63, 217) or Bill Kennedy (6-6,
225) up front. Lloyd Weston.
Ralph Cindrich, and Dave Mc-
Grath will share the lineback-
ing.

A few minor injuries could
hurt the Cubs. Linebacker John
Wozniak has a bad ankle and
hasn't praicticed  Week; Tom
Porecca and West-on are plagued
with bad knees. But they should
be ready for Friday's game.

The Cubs are anxious to beat
Penn State.

“It’s -a matter -of pride,” ex-
plains Rosenberg. “Most of our
boys have played Wilth or against
Penn State’s players in high
school. We’re -going to match
them up individual to individ-
ual.”

As Boot-ers Become Pedestrians

The soccer team had one
tiger and ten pussycats in
its tank yesterday afternoon.
The tiger, Pete Snyder, wasn’t
enough as Grove City humbled
the booters, 3-0, at Forbes Field.

Many of the booters adn.it
that they don’t have «the skill of
last year's team. However, in
previous games they made up
for this with hustle. Whatever
hustle there was against Grove
City came from Snyder, the left
wing. The rest of the_team may
as well have stayed in the dress-
ing room.

“I dor"t know what it is,” re-

marked oaeh Le Bemis. “They '

look (JWH on {hose schools
(Grove City and Slippery Rock),
yet Grove City has better soc-
cer players. It’s' not just hustle.
They outshot us and outtraped
us.”

Actually, ‘Grove City’s play-
ers lacked the ﬁnesse shown by
the booters, but they used their
legs in another way—to run.
This was something that the
booters didn’t bother to consi-
der.

It was hustle that led to all
three goals. Left wing Pete Ah-
selmo, the Wolverines leading
scorer, headed in a long kick in
the opening minute of play.
“Whenever there’s a man run-
ning for the ball, you have to
expect anything,” said Bemis.
“Our guys just Watched him.

They didn’t think he was a
threat.”
The “non - threat” Anselmo

later added the other two Grov-
er goals.

If Grove City players have
any bruises to nurse, they must
have come from all the back-
slapping they did on the bench.
The booters forgot that soccer
is a. contact sport. Except for
reserve halfback Blaine Popp,
they acted like modern dancers,
keeping a good distance from
their opponents whenever possi-
ble.

’ Still, Bemis was not totally
downcast. “This is still a good
ballclub,” he asserted. “They’re a

came in during the third quar-
ter against Slippery Rock and
really did a job,” said Taub. . '

The freshman booters will
tackle Slippery Rock with a
spirit of revenue today at the
Rockets’ ﬁeld. Slippery Rock
beat the fresh, 1-0, at Kennard
Field Two weeks ago.

“The whole team is anxious
to win.this one,” commented
halfback Dave Taub. “Most of
the goals scored against us this
season came on oursimple er-
rors. We still weren't used to
each others moves. Our offen-
sive lineman have gotten the
ball on their side of the ﬁeld,
but after that they couldn’t do
anything with it, and it was us-

ually stolen.”

Taub considered goalie Dick

do. “DiEmido ‘has the coolest’

many good shots from the cen-
ter of the ﬁeld.”

“Coa<ch‘ Snyder will probably
go back to a 4-3-3 defense this
time,” Taub continued. “This
