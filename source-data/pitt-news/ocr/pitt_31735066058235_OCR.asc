Law students assist undergrads

By Dirk Kaufman

Managing Editor

About four weeks ago, a group of
students emptied the contents of a
fire extinguisher through a window
on the eighth floor of Bruce Hall.

John Carrol, a sophomore business
major, and several of his friends were
accused and called befofe thesjudi-
cial board of the university.

A judicial hearing was held to de-
termine if Carrol was guilty and, if so,
what sanctions would be

held, Carrol went to Dean Birdy, a
third-year Pitt law student, for advice
on how to handle the case. When the
hearing_ concluded, Carrol had
proven his innocence.

”He handled it very well,” Carrol-

said of Birdy. ’'I don't think we would
have presented our case in the same
way."

Birdy is heading a group of law stu-
dents who make up the Student Bar
Association's Legal Assistance Pro-
gram. The organization assists stu-
dents in presenting their cases at
judicial board hearings.

”It gives the students a little more
power,” Birdy «said. "They know
what's going on going in and can
concentrate on telling what hap-

 

levied _
against him. Before the hearing was ’

pened without concentrating on how
they. present the case.”

Birdy said there are about 25 law
students involved in the process,. and
they have taken about 10 cases this
term.

"We have a fairly good rate of suc-
cessful endeavors,” Birdy said. "The
truth comes out better when some-
one is there who knows how to bring
it out.”

‘Sometimes, although the student
may have a good case and is sure he
didn't do wrong, he can't present it
in a way the judicial board would un-
derstand.”

Birdy said Brenda Pardini, who
heads the judicial process for the
Office of Student Activities, will give
a list of those who offer assistance to
a student who will appear before the
board. .

He said he would like to upgrade
the program, which has been in ex-
istence for several years, to a point
where students will be aware of it
without the assistance of Pardini.

”Right' now we are on good terms
with them,” he said. ’’If that becomes
awkward for whatever reason in the
future‘, we'd like_to be independent
of them.” ,

He also said if the students are

more aware of the service, they will
hopefully call __on it soon after being

 

showcase

 

accused.

"Often, they won't know about the .

service until a couple of days before
the hearing,” he said. ”The more
time we have before the trial, the bet-
ter off they are.”

Carrol said Birdy’s help allowed
him to be less nervous going into the
hearing; "

"He knew what to say and how to
direct it,” Carrol said.‘ '’It definitely
helped us to "get an idea of what it
was going to be like.’’

Birdy said the service is free. He
said the law students who are in-
volved are given the opportunity to
work in a courtroom atmosphere and
become more familiar with adminis-
trative law through the‘ process.

”The experience is similar to what
we will see when we begin practice,”

he said.

He said the participants receive ex-
perience in cross-examining witness-
es, preparing their own witnesses for
questioning and preparing a case for

' trial.

"It's difficult enough for someone
who knows what's going on,” he
said. "You don't want the person ac-
cused cross-examining the witnesses.

”Getting a third, independent party ~

involved in the process makes it
much easier for the truth to come
out.”

Montefiore opens I

new transplant unit

By Michelle Zollner

Sta ff Writer

A new bone marrow transplanta-
tion unit will be open to patients on
Monday.

Montefiore Hospital's specially
designed and staffed transplantation
unit is the first in the western Penn-
sylvania, according to hospital

- officials. _
The patients of this unit are being’

treated for leukemia, some other
cancers and aplastic anemia.

The treatment of bone marrow
transplant patients results in the sup-
pression of the patients’ immune sys-
tem for an extended period of time,
thus leaving the patients open to op-
portunistic infection.

Consequently, this new 11-bed
unit will provide patients with the
necessary environment for proper
treatment of these diseases.

”The.hospita| found a need to con-
struct something different than an
operating room or another area
which presently exists in the hospi-
tal,” said Irwin Goldberg, executive
director of Montefiore Hospital.

”Things that would not affect the
normal individual would have a dras-
tic effect on these patients,” said
Goldberg. He said these patients
must have a clean and sterilized en-.
vironment. ~

The bone marrow patient’s stay in
the hospital is approximately 50 days,
costing approximately $100,000,
Goldberg said. The usual stay of pa-
tients in the hospital is eight days ac-
cording to Goldberg.

”These patients are twice as cost-
ly,” Goldberg continued. The
amount of expense not only comes

from the length of stay forsthe patient

in the hospital but also the special-

ized team of nurses and physicians,

which need to be on staff. 4

Most insurance companies cover
this type of procedure.

”The design of the unit _and its
nurse staffing facilitates not only pa-
tient care but also family care. The
families are an important part of the
team,” said Patricia Schaefer, head
nurse of the unit. ' I -

The specially trained nurses pre-
pare the family for the stress of the
bone marrow transplantation
process. .

Educational and weekly support ‘

meetings help the patient and the
family through the transplantation.

"A bonding between patients, fa-
milies and staff is formed," said
Schaefer. _

Louis Burdman, 42, has survived
more than I3 months since his trans-
plant at Montefiore.

"l have had no real limitations be-

cause of the operation. I don't eat_

anything special. I go fishing, camp-
ing and walk a lot. I wouldn't do any-
thing stupid like run a marathon, but
then I didn't do that before my oper-
ation," said Burdman.

According to Richard K. Shadduck,
director of the bone transplantation
unit, during the first three months cer-
tain actions mustbe restricted. At six
to nine months, the activity restric-
tions are liberalized.,At one year the
patient can return to a normal level
of activity.

’’On Monday 10 out of the 11 beds
will be full,’’ said Shadduck. He said
the 11th bed will be filled by the mid-
dle of the week.

According to Shadduck, the unit
expects 60 patients a year.

”We have a waitinglist for the unit
up until January,” he said.

PITTSBURGH (AP) — The elab-
orate weave pattern of an 8,000-
year-old garment found in an In-
dian burial site points to a remark-
ably advanced technology for that ’
time, University of Pittsburgh
scientists say.

’’It would take a couple of days
at least to weave a cloth like that,”
said James Adovasio, chairman of
anthropology at Pitt. "It’s far finer
than the needs of the [burial] sit-
uation would dictate."

The cloth was found last week
in one of 94 graves uncovered
three years ago in a bog on Flori-
da's east coast near Titusville,
Adovasio said.

He said the cloth has surprised
archaeologists with its elaborate
weave pattern, which was even
more advanced than other speci-
mens discovered since construc-

Pitt scientists: Indians
had advanced culture

tion workers turned up the first
remains three years ago.

The newly discovered fabric
was‘ found in a grave that
been ”loaded dow with other
grave goods — a projectile point,
composite tools of drilled wood,
bone awls and a drilled shark's
tooth,” Adovasio said.

Scientists say the cloth remains
are the oldest and best preserved
textiles ever found in the eastern
United States.

The cloth was fairly well pre-'
served for its age because it was
compressed in the airless bog,
which contains a weak acidthat
has a preservative effect.

Fragments of the coarse cloth
were sent to Pitt for analysis be-
cause the school's archaeologists
are nationally known for interpret-
ing ancient styles of weaving.

Reagan to address nation on US-Iran relations

WASHINGTON — President Rea-
gan told congressional leaders the
United States sent military equipment
to Iran in an attempt to establish ties
with moderate elements in the Irani-
an government, published reports
said yesterday.

At press time, the president was set
to address the nation in a nationally
televised address to clear up what he
called ”rumors” the press was
spreading in those reports.

The remarks were made at a
closed-door meeting Wednesday and
were reported by The Washington
Post, The New York Times and The
Baltimore Sun. The newspapers quot-
ed unidentified administration and
congressional sources.

The Times reported that an ad-
ministration official paraphrased Rea-
gan at the meeting as saying the
United States would be at fault if
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini died
”and we had not made any prepara-
tions for contacts with a future re-
gime. The arms are necessary for
that.”

Wednesday's congressional brief-
ing was the first since the emergence
of reports of a purported administra-
tion attempt to complete an arms-for-
hostages deal with Iran to spring
Americans held captive in Lebanon.

”I have not changed my mind,”

said Senate Democratic leader Robert
C. Byrd, W.Va., after the meeting.
Byrd has sharply_criticized what he
said is the administration's apparent
violation of its own policy.not to
negotiate with terrorists.

Leftist Filipino
leader found slain ‘

MANILA, Philippines —— A lead-
ing leftist supporter of President
Corazon Aquino was found shot and
stabbed to death yesterday. His son
and fellow leftists said they suspect-

responsible but had no proof.

Police Cpl. Ernesto Bernabeo said

' . the body of Rolando Olalia, 50, was

found off a highway in northeastern
Manila. .

Olalia was president of the Parti-
do ng Bayan, or Peoples Party, found-
ed three months ago by former
Communist Party leaders. He also
was head of the 500,000-member
May 1 Movement, a militant labor
federation.

Earlier this week, Olalia told a
news conference his federation
would launch a general strike‘ if the
military attempted a coup. There

Essence editor:
Challenge yourselves

Cathy Danko

For The Pitt News

Blacks in today's societylmust
continually challenge themselves
in order to succeed, according to
Susan Taylor, editor-in-chief of E5-
sence magazine. Taylor spoke at
Pitt as part of the Black Action So-
ciety's Black Week Celebration.

Taylor spoke Tuesday to a
crowd of about 70 people in the
William Pitt Ballroom. She said
blacks must be physically fit and
mentally alert to compete in to-
day's job market.

”We [blacks] mustn't-succumb
to academic, social and econom-
ic pressures of student life,’’ she
said. ”You must challenge your-
self daily.”

She said blacks need to be
people-oriented. ’’If we under-
stand how to communicate and
motivate people, we can make

corporate America work to our‘~

[b|acks’] advantage.”

One of the questions posed dur-
ing the lecture concerned the
positive action graduating black
students can take to start their own
businesses in the future. Here Tay-
lor stressed the importance of
business internships. She also—sug—
gested reading trade journals and
communicating with people.

The predominantly black crowd
-who turned out to see Taylor ap-
peared enthusiastic about her
presentation. Pitt student Terri Tin-
nin said Taylor's message was
"very inspirational, especially her
comments on challenging the
self.” - '

Taylor urged blacks to reserve
”quiet time alone” in order to get
to know themselves.

”Learn your strengths and
weaknesses so you are the best
you can be,” she said. ”Now is
the time for action to extend our
black community.”

Iowa students get a bum rap  

By Greg Smith

AP Writer

DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Stu-
dents at Iowa State University are put-

ting the squeeze on administrators,
who say they're really a soft touch
when it comes to toilet paper.

The tissue issue arose last week,

when some dormitory residents com-
plained the toilet paper was too
rough and demanded a better

product. .

’’It’s just brown-wrap paper.  It's

one ply, rough, coarse and hard. You

can hear it crinkle,” said Kim Colli-

er, an 18-year-old freshman from

Chicago who's leading the com-

plaints.

Jim Day, director of Richardson
Court Residence Halls, which com-
prise about a third of the 20 campus

dorms that house 10,000 students,
said officials are willing to help
relieve the situation. S

’’If they want [a better brand], then
we'll try to provide it,” Day said
Tuesday. ‘’’It may involve getting
different brands and letting the stu-
dents get involved in testing it to get
some ideas.”

The toilet-paper tug-of-war at the
Ames campus, about 30 miles north
of Des Moines, has gotten national
attention, and Collier said in a tele-
phone interview that her phone
hadn't stopped ringing since the sto-
ry broke. 0‘

”Everybody’s talking about it,” she
said. ”One guy from Florida Southern
University wrote me, telling me how
he heard about our situation and how
he wished he could ship the whole
dormitory some Charmin.”

Collier said about 90 percent of the

600 students living in her dormwant
the university to change brands and
that other students are being polled.

Robert Perish, purchasing manager

at Iowa State, said the school had or- - 

dered 170,000 rolls of the present
brand. He said he 'couldn’t remem-
ber the name, but that it cost about
25 cents a roll, or about $42,500 a
year. .

”lt’s definitely not as nice a quali-
ty_as you'd find in a store, but it's not
cardboard either,” Perish said, add-
ing there had never been widespread

complaints about toilet paper before. .
Day said a better brand might be
more costly and that students could '

see that reflected in higher room and
board rates. ’

Collier said some students had be-’

gun receiving care packages from
relatives and even from strangers,
filled with name-brand toilet paper.

While doing this, we attempted to

intact.

Was that letter for real? I can't be-

Ms. Martin's hostile rhetoric against

only hope The Pitt News will con-
tinue its efforts to keep Oakland safe

Oakland has become a very high
crime area, and because of the cur-
rent violent instances, we feel it is im-
perative that the university
newspapers take the responsibility to
inform students of important issues
that may affect them.

Alas, no,.these crimes are too real.

But to people like Ms. Martin, the
rape was not a crime — the public
outcry caused by it was. None of
these problems is affecting her, so
there must not be any problems. We
are just white bigots looking for a flag
to wave.

of conveying?

Who is racist here?

The letter that you decided to print
regarding the alleged rape suspect
was way off the mark. I commend
you for printing that composite
sketch. , °

The author of that letter evidently
is under the false conception that if
you mind your own business, people
will leave you alone, meaning not
rape you. The unfortunate girl who
was raped was the victim in this sit-
uation, not the guy whose picture ap-
peared on your front page.

. Janet, I don't know .if you've no-
ticed, but rape is a major issue. In-
formingthe campus population that
there is a rapist lurking on or near
campus seems like front-page ‘news

he is black, white, red, yellow or pur-
ple. Congratulations, Pitt News, for
finally providing some responsible
journalism.—

I do not limit my understanding
when I come in contact with a per-
son ‘of a different race. I think we can
bypass the issue of race and learn to
live together. If Janet Louise Martin
cannot make enough room in this
world for anyone but herself, then
she obviously lives alone in her fan-
tasy world, not in the real world_.

Wendy Wisniewski
J CA5 '89

I am in total disbelief of the letter
written by Janet Lousie Martin. The
coverage of the rape story was not a
case of overkill. It has nothing to do

with race. We are talking about a ‘

man threatening, stealing and some-
times raping girls.

After answering journalists’ questions
for over a decade, Robyn Hitchcock is
deservedly interview—weary. He recit-
ed, half jokingly and half disgustedly,
a list of most—requested answers during
a pre-show interview last Tuesday night
at Graffiti: "| haven't got a dead wife,
but l do have a wife. l don't have an
insect mother, nor a light bulb head. I
like Sid Barrett. I don't know where he
lives. And I don't take drugs)"

Hitchcock at times sounds world-
weary as well, saying his hope on this
tour is "to stay alive. l hope everyone
else stays alive as well." But Hitchcock
will quickly turn around and talk with
hilariously irreverant verve on topics like
his literary work—in-progress about a tor-
tured professor who at times finds him-
self kidnapped by ghouls or
transformed into plants or pizza. The
dichotomy between his darker and
happier sides proves confusing to some,
but Hitchcock relishes playing both
roles.

Robyn Hitchcock's contrasts color his
latest "low—key record" E/ement Of
light. But if the album reflects any self-
division, Hitchcock only feels it a realis-
tic portrait.

"You should be able to have a good
laugh and maybe be upset as well. 
Every record's going to have its own
mood, and within that mood you should
have highs andlows.  I try for as
much variety as possible."

Taking an even more common—sense
approach to the question, Hitchcock
said.,"A record is a collection of T0
songs. lf those lO songs are all saying

I _ ' the same thing, why not just write one
'song?"

Hitchcock displayed his eclectic vir-
tuosity with his "nuclear three—piece"
band in a two-encore performance last
Tuesday in Pittsburgh. From the comic
hilarity (and biting insight) of "Uncor-
rected Personality Traits” to the point-
ed venom of "The President," the show
proved engaging and intelligent. The
three—member group delivered more im-

pact than many larger bands with their

tight backing vocals, and Hitchcock's
ability to sing and play dynamic guitar
work at once aided them greatly.
For the uninformed, Robyn Hitchcock
first gained attention as leader of The
Soft Boys, a band not unlike Television
or the Velvet Underground in widely in-

_\_ ._

 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  

 

 HOB‘: 

   

 
 
  
 

  
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 

fluencing other groups. When fellow
Soft Boy Kimberly Rew deported and
went on to travel sunshiny commercial
pop paths with Katrina and The
Waves, Hitchcock went solo and creat-
ed records like his affecting, varied,
largely-acoustic masterpiece "l Often
Dream Of Trains." Subsequent albums.
featured the backing band The Egyp-
tians; Fegman/'a was full of haunting,
quirky melodies, and Gotta let This Hen
Out reprised highlights form the Hitch-
cock song catalog in a live setting.

Of E/ement Of light, Hitchcock said,
"lf you've never heard any of the other
records, it doesn't really matter a lot,
and if you have, you'll probably like
it." Knowing the listener must start
somewhere, however, E/ement, with its
clear, open sound and variety of
material, makes for a fine starter LP.

Much of the new album recalls the
work of other artists. While not feeling
directly influenced by other musicians,
Hitchcock still feels "you always retain
the force of the stuff that you heard
when you were young, [and] John Len-
non, to me, was my Buddy Holly, if you
like."

Hitchcock sees the spirit of past mu-
sicians appearing in new work as a fas-
cinating prospect: "You read a book,
and it finishes, and you're sad because
the I characters are dead, [or] the
author's dead.  The book is shut, and
you often think, 'l wonder what those
characters would be like if they were
still alive?' "

Robyn Hitchcock leaves no clues as
to how to resurrect any part of himself
but his music after he dies. Even his
songs may receive skewed interpreta-
tions, though.

"[People] don't really know what |'m
aboutanyway," Hitchcock said, "and

'11

I'm not about to tell them.

In the end, Hitchcock leaves con— A

siderations of himself to others if they
choose to take the time for such mat-
ters. But how does Robyn Hitchcock
view himself?

"| don't view myself."

Likely, that's best. For in overanalyz-
ing his own wild tales and unusual
mood pieces, Robyn Hichcock might
work too hard at being his unique self.
He doesn't need to.

Editor's Note: The actual interview
was conducted by John Devitofran-
ceschi, W/?CT's "John Doe, " as we//

Musica Antiqua

Going for baroque

roque period — focusing on

  Arq uette is  l

By Dave Zuchowski

When the esteemed German
recording company Deutsche
Grammophon recognized the
boom in Baroque music, they ex-
tended a contract to l\/lusica An-
tiqua of Cologne, Germany. It
was a decision which has re-
warded them well — for l\/lusi—
ca Antiqua has won dozens of

awards, and the records have

sold well.

lt is those recordings which will
make many Pittsburghers nod
with recognition when they learn
of the coming Pittsburgh appear-
ance of l\/lusica Antiqua at 8
p.m.'on Saturday, Nov. l5, un-
der the auspices of the Renais-
sance and Baroque Society.

lvlusica Antiqua was estab-
lished in Cologne in l973 by
Reinhard Goebel, who con-
tinues today as its director‘. It is
Goebel's single—minded devo-
tion to the group which has led
to their characteristic sound; his

interpretations are distinctive’

and lively, virtuosic in ways that
often make an audience gasp in
appreciation. , .

In recent years, lvlusica Anti-
qua has expanded to a small or-
chestra of 28 in order to play a
different repertoire. However,
most of their l 50 yearly concerts

a.nd "recording engagements‘

feature the chamber ensemble
which will appear in Pittsburgh,
consisting of five string players
(violins, violas and cello) and a
harpsichordist. Two of the en-

semble members, Phoebe Car- ..
rai and Paula Kibildis, are.

Americans. ~
Their program on Nov. l5 will
feature concertos of.the late Ba-

familiar names like Bach, Handel
and Telemann, as well as less
familiar ones like Aubert and von
Sachsen—Weimer. The Baroque
concerto form features a small
group of soloists accompanied
by harpsichord. During the
course of the five concertos, var-
ious players of the violin and via-
la will be featured.

ln addition to the concertos,
l\/lusica Antiqua will play a piece

' by Bach which might win some

award for the composition with
the longest title: ”Fourteen can-
ons on the first eight bass notes
of the aria from the Goldberg
Variations."

The Renaissance and Baroque
Society will dedicate this concert
to Colin Sterne who is retiring
this year as professor of music at
the University of Pittsburgh. He
was a founder of the society
and, as one of the first Baroque
flutists in the country, a pioneer’
among Americans in rediscover-
ing early instruments.

lvlusica Antiqua's last-appear-
ance here in Pittsburgh in l983

provided the Renaissance and

Baroque Society with the largest
audience to ever attend one of
their concerts. Tickets for this
concert, one of the area's most
important and significant cham-
ber music events of the year, are
selling briskly. As there is a pos-
sibility of a concert sellout, the
society is recommending that
ticket reservations be made‘be—
forehand by calling 682-7262.

Prices are lO for the general

public and $5 for students. The
concert will be held on Satur- V,
day,‘ Nov. l5 at 8 p.m. at Syn— A  "
od Hall, l25 North Craig St. in ,
Oakland.

Rosanna Arquette has made a

of amazing skill and range.

As a performer, she is hard to

 -Maxis Allegheny avern
Ethnic cuisine

with Cl difference

By Chris Biancheria

and Jeff Micher

When was the last time you
had a bowl of piping hot Einlauf
soup? Or how about a plate of
tangy Hasenpfeffer, smothered
with a red wine sauce, accom-
panied by a dish of red cab-
bage and chased with a Beck's
Dark? if you're getting a little fed
up with the mundane, over-
popularized ethnic scene, Max's
Allegheny Tavern, located at
537 Suismon St. on the North
Side is the spot for you. ’

Max's has an extensive menu

_ of authentic German cuisine that

caters to all tastes. We started
our meal with a cup of Einlauf

_soup ($i), a chicken broth-

based noodle soup. The noo-
dles are made by-dropping a
seasoned batter of flour and
eggs into briskly boiling chicken
broth. Moving on, we sampled
the Hasenpfeffer, a braised,
peppery rabbit dish coated with
a savory, tangy sauce which
was on the spicy side. Also sam-
pled was a rich and filling Ger-
man favorite, Sauerbraten, a
generous-portion of very lean
top round of roasted beef.
The sausages offered are the
three traditional German
sausages: knockwurst, a spicy
beef sausage, bratwurst, a deli-
cate veal and pork sausage,
and weisswurst, a mild veal
sausage (each for $4.95 or a
sampler platter for $7.95). The
schnitzels include the Wiener
Schnitzel of Vienna fame for
$8.95 and four other regional

4 I 2-422- 5000

schnitzels, the most taste-
tempting being the Schniztel

Liechtenstein for $8.95, a bread-

ed veal cutlet stuffed with West-
phalian ham and Emmenthaler
cheese.

in a battle between West-
phalian flank steak ($8.95) and
fish, we chose a tender and
flavorful filet of lcelandic sole
($7.95), sauteed in white wine

and butter, topped with toasted ,

almonds which went well with a
glass of white wine from Max's
more—than—adequate wine list.

All dinners come with rye and
pumpernickel rolls, sauerkraut
relish and Max's apple butter.
This apple butter was not only a
pleasant change of pace, but
surprisingly delicious, especially
with the pumpernickel rolls.
There is_ a choice of two side
orders with every dinner from a
selection including magnificent
potato pancakes, spaetzleand
hot German potato salad.

For those with a lighter appe-
tite, Max's has plenty of options.

-An "Allegheny Favorites" sec-

tion includes four types of salad,
ranging from $3.75 for Bavari-
an Wurst salad to $6.95 for
seafood salad. Also for $6.95 is
Max's Goulash, served with a
hearty garden salad, bread and

- their homemade spaetzle.

There's even an extensive list
of sandwiches ranging from

$3.50 for fish to $4.25 for Max's

' reuben. if yourtastes lie more in

the American vein, Max's has
for $3.95 a great Maxburger.
Max's also has a variety of des-
seiis, priced from Si .25 for ap-

A letter

it was a dark and stormy
night (sorry, iust settin' the
mood) when Susan Wash-
bum, a.k.a. "the critic," sat
in the audience of the musical
Grease. The lights dimmed,
the audience hushed, her
pencil started to move. The
words flew down on her
tablet like "greased light-
ning." Song' ‘after song,
dance after dance, line after
line enveloped_the audience
—- enveloped everybody but
the critic. This production
wasn't going to get off that
easy! There had to be some-
thing wrong with it. Let's see.
Ah look, "new labels on the
Rolling Rock beer battles, the
stirrups on Sandy's final
costume and, most important-
ly, the movements of the cast
during the dances.  "Yes,
the critic now has solid
grounds to close the show, or
at least rough it up a bit. Let's
be serious now. '

In reading Miss Wash-
burn's "critique" of the
University of Pittsburgh Thea-
ter's production of Grease, I
couldn't help but laugh to my-
self. I must call attention to the
first major attack lead by our
critic. Who is Sandy Dum-

Grease is more than energetic

_ acted the same way.

browski? Well, according to
Washburn, Sandy is nothing.
Au contraire, miss critic. San-
dy is something. She is the"

. twinkle of the production, the

innocence, the sanity. She is
the lovely.voice that carries
out over the audience in the
heartbreaking, yet hopeful

. song, "lt's raining on prom
night.”  it is one thing to .

criticize a questionable line
but not an entire character. '
Donna plays Sandy the way
Sandy ought to be played —_

Let's ask ourselves another
question. Just what is wrong
with the way Nona Gerard
dances? According to Wash-
burn, "Nona is the worst
offender of including modern
movement [into] '50s—style
dancing.” Uh, Miss Wash-
burn, what do you consider
"modern movement?"

Now it's timeto pick on the
girls as a whole. Our critic
said that the girls acted "very
much alike." Gerard should ’
act differently, she's in the
leader role of-the Pink Ladies.
To belong to a group such as
the Pink Ladies, nonconformi-
ty is a no—nol Maybe, iust

Wait, have i painted myself
into a corner? Do i disagree
with everything Miss Wash-
burn has said? I must con-
cede. I do agree with her on
some points. Yes, the cast is
"energetic and exciting."
Yes, Ken and Camille do a
wonderful (ob. Yes, Nona
"gives a good rendition of
'Look at Me, l'm Sandra
Dee.’ "

A standing ovation goes to
the cast and crew of Grease.
Oh, and by the. way, stirrup
pants are not the brain storm
of Calvin Klein. They were in-
troduced back in the '50s.

In conclusion, Miss Wash-
burn states, "lf you want to
see. an accurate picture of life
in the '50s, stay home and
look through a photo album."
Of course Grease is not an
accurate picture of life in the
'50s — it's better. its the fun
of the '50s. i think our critic
should stay home and look
through old photo albums,
while the rest of Pitt goes out
and enioys the hit musical
Grease. .

’         Gabriel looks hard for Mercy St.  

By James Crary

Peter Gabriel appeared at the
Civic Arena on Nov. 8, accom-
panied by Yousou N'Dour, an
African musician/singer. The
opening band, Yousou N'Dour
and a tribal rhythm ’n’ blues en-
semble were refreshing. The
’ — band reappeared during Gab-
riel's encore song, "In Your
Eyes/’

‘Gabriel's voice is huskier in
concert, and his attitude is that
of a burghermaster. The band
was a brisk crew of the finest

' rock offers, dressed in the garb
of intelligentsian secret police, a
conspicuous parody, at once
trite and charming. The occa-
sional lapses into political
themes have always been the
heightened mystique of Gabriel.
It was a shame that the crowd
would not let him finish ”Here
Comes the Flood." Although
durin _
soulfugf, almost doleful tune about
unemployment — the crowd
was phenomenally polite. But

Peter Gabriel appeared in Pittsburgh last Saturday.

"Don't Give Up" - a’

hey, this is the steel valley.

Peter Benenson and Ann Sex-
ton are two obvious influences
on Gabriel. His tribute to Benen-
son, founder of Amnesty lnterna-
tional, has been manifold: the
Conspiracy of Hope tour, the
publicizing of Costa Rica's Insti-
tute of Peace are a few of
Gabriel's more conspicuous ac-
tivities in the circulation of Am-
nesty lnternational and their
dialogue of conscience. Ann
Sexton, the convalescent Ameri-
can poet who died as a result of
suicide, a woman whose _skele-
tons just wouldn't seem to stay
in the closet, is the authoress of
-45 Mercy Street. ”Looking for
Mercy Street,” a plea in sur-
realistic style for faith, is not the
only tune which her work in-
spired. The famous ”Sledge-

’ hammer" also borrows casually

from her imagery. This is a debt
he acknowledges.

Religious themes have stud-
ded Gabriel's work from time im-
memorial. The band Genesis,
which owes Gabriel much more
than is generally acknow-

 

ledged, wa_s liberally interested
in t e Book of Revelations and
Christian virtues. Gabriel has al-
ways been a keeper of faith.
There are difficult passages in
”Looking for Mercy Street"
which one can finally under-
stand as holding religious intona-
tion. The refrain, let’s take the
boat out, wait until darkness
recurs in the song. The film Wait
Unti/ Dark is alluded to master-
fully. It was a suspense yarn in
which the rescue tension is deft-
ly managed to the final moments
of the film. Yet Ann Sexton was
not rescued. So who is herfaher
— the father Gabriel alludes to
in the final verse, discerned as
the song fades, Ann and her
father are outin the boat, riding
the water, riding the waves to
the sea.

The concert was managed

bravely,‘ and althoughvit was -.
‘ Gabriel's first appearance at the

Civic Arena, it was managed
well ‘acousticall . The themes
were conveye , the rhythms

rocked excellently. And the

show was impressive. Just about

AP Writer

Jonathan Bongiovi was in the
pizza business. "But they didn't
Understand the idea of egg-
shaped pizza. I got fired." SO
he became Jon Bon Jovi, be-
cause that's how his last name
should be pronounced and often
wasn't, and got into a business
where he feels understood.

He's a 24-year-old New Jer-
sey hard rocker. S/ippery When
Wet, the third Mercury album
by his five—piece band, Bon Jovi,
is platinum. It went to No. 3 on
the best-selling chart in Cashbox
magazine for the third week on
Nov. I.

In Bil/board magazine, Slip-
pery When Wet went to No. I .
”We sort of lived the life of a
NO. I band for a week, on the
road," Bon Jovi said. "Doc
IVIcGhee, our manager, was
coming to Sioux Falls, S.D. He
missed his connection in Denver
and was told there were no
more flights. He rented a Lear
]et.’The promoter said, 'Why
don't you all take it tomorrow to
the next city.’ He paid for it. Eve-
ry promoter was ecstatic. They
had seen US struggIing."

Soevery promoter for a week,
seeing Bon Jovi concerts sell Out,

paid for-a ride on the Lear iet.
Bon Jovi said, "It's the only thing
we've ever done in excess. It
ended Saturday night. It was a
lot of fun.

"I came home Saturday night
and sat in my one—bedroom
apartment on the beach. I have
to borrow a car if I want to get

 

around. My cars are put away
for the winter; they're not win-
ter cars.

"The band is much more com-
fortable any day in the local bar
’n' grill than I'd ever be in the
PaIIadium." _ '

Bon Jovi started touring in mid-
July, a month before the album
was released. The first five
weeks they opened for .38 Spe-
cial; they headlined the rest. "I
wasn't crazy about opening for
somebody at first. It could have
been awful, but it‘ wasn't.
They're the classiest people I've
ever had the pleasure of work-
ing with. They're going to be

dear friends for a ‘very long ,

time." »

The tour, running through the
first half of October, also took
the band to Canada, Japan and
two festivals in Europe. Touring
resumed Nov. 7 in Europe, and
they return to America in De-
cember. -

Bon Jovi was born in Perth
Amboy, N.J.,, and has two
brothers. He wanted .to be in a
rock ’n' roll band as long as he
can remember.

"Sure, I admire Bruce Spring-
steen and always have. Little
Steve Van Zandt is even more a
role model."

He began by playing guitar.
Bon Jovi said, "The only reason
I had to sing was [that] nobody
else. could sing and play at the
same time. I had to learn. ltwas
pretty tough but I got it down.
 The band in this way, shape
and form has been together four
years now.”

A New York radio station put

name. Bon Jovi said, "But it was
veryimportant to me it be a
band and not a .solo deal."

The radio station wanted him
to sign a. release for "Runa—
way," Bon Jovi said. "But I
knew too muchabout the busi-
ness to sign that away. It wasn't
my best song at the time. There
were eight or nine I was shop-
ping that are now in the gar-
bage can.

"We're not ones to write and
save songs for next year. If they
don't make the album, they dis-
appear. We don't want to harp
on old stuff; let's move on is our
attitude." Bon Jovi was the

name of the I984 album; 7800

Bon Jovi picks all the single
releases. ''If it happens, good,

and if it doesn't, it's my fault. Let _

me make or break my own ca-
reer." Thecurrent single, "You
Give Love a Bad Name," was
No.8 and climbing on the best-
selling chart of Nov 8.

About concerts, hesaid,-"You
see bands where it looks like
they have a glass window be-
tween them and the crowd.
There's none of that with us.

"I've been pulled into the
crowd many nights because I
got too close. That's the fun of
it. People are nice, they just

anybody._If somebody [umps on

A wonderful ada

By Ike Shibley

James Clavell has written
several epic novels that have
had the potential for translation
to the big screen. Shogun was
a highly successful mini—series
about ancient Japan. /\/ob/e
House and Ta/'-Pan were two
works concerning_China. lt
would seem that if either of these
should be produced, it should
be through another mini.-series.
Yet Raphaella De Laurentis has
opted for the movie format to

,3/.produce Clavell’s Ta/'-Pan, and

it is unclear whether this was a
wise economic decision. Theta-
tal box office receipts in the next
few weeks will surely determine
the wisdom of De Laurentis’
judgment. '

The story itself would not have
had as much impact if television
had been used as the medium of
interpretation for Clavell's book.
The film Tai—Pan was shot entire—

C ly on location in China, which is

a first in the motion picture indus-
try. The setting helped add to
the fullness of the film and made
it a more intense experience.
Even the actors were aided by
location because they could see
exactly what their characters

must have seen. The costume

design was extremely elaborate
as were most of the props. This

59-‘close attention to detail may

have been overlooked in a mini-
series since the television budget

is generally much smaller than '

that for a motion picture, espe-
cially one of such a grand design
as Ta/'-Pan.

‘The camera work in the film
gave the viewer a comprehen-
sive idea of what Hong Kong

. and the shores of ‘mainland Chi-

na must have looked like in the
l 8005. There were many beau-

tiful~shots of both the land and

the water surrounding it. Since
the setting in the film was as im-
portant, if not more so, than the
story, it was enioyable to see at-
tention paid to the details of the

" scenery. Daryl Duke directed
this film in much the same way ‘

he did The Thorn Birds, concen-
trating much of his efforton na-
ture instead of the actors.

go, The story itself centers on the

British trader Dirk Struan, played
by Bryan Brown, who gets evict-
ed from the shores of mainland
China by the emperor for deal-

ing opium. He continues to traffic A

opium but does so from the is-
land of Hong Kong, which he
has convinced the English Parlia-
ment to take control of. Many of
his compatriots think him mad for
wanting to obtain a lump of rock

 off the coast of China, but he is

not to be denied. Theimost in-
genious part of the movie comes
as the final credits roll while an
aerial view of modern Hong
Kong is shown, thus serving as

' the final testament to Struan's

good iudgment.

The plot gets confusing at
times, which is "a common
problem when an involved work

‘ of fiction gets converted to film.

characters’ lives and their rela-
tionships to others seem to be of
importance.

Most of the acting in the film
was done by people without a
reputation in the acting commu-
nity. The performances were
well-suited to the film, without
any one person‘ being over-
powering. Bryan Brown was the
leading man, and he played the
only memorable character. He
was enioyable to watch and
was well-suited to his role. He
spoke with a strong English ac-
cent that was extremely pleas-
ant to listen to. His character
was strong and often ruthless but
was eminently compassionate.
This compassion made Dirk Stru-
an the likeable character that he
was. . _ "

Ta/'-Pan employs a maiestic
score and attempts to tie
together two generations but is

~ not the epic it attempts to be.

The sub-plot involving Struan’s
son is interesting, but too much
time is devoted to it. The movie
is entertainin and somewhat

educational, but it often tries to
reach beyond this limit and in
doing so falls short of its original
goals. By concentrating its ef-
forts on a few characters instead

of trying to be so sweeping in its
approach, it could have been a
much better film. Still, the movie

THIRD STAGE
Boston
MCA Records

By John Mccombe

For this we waited eight
years?
ln all honesty, Third Stage is

an amazing record. Not good
 just amazing. Your apprecia-
tion for this collection will de-
pend upon your fondness of the
recent past. For stuck—in-
the-'70s, anti-synth power
chord worshippers, this album is,
well, like, really cool. Most
everyone else will recognize
these dinosaur-ic dirges for what
they really are — boring, repe-
titious and only occasionally
tuneful.

Album highlights include the
single "Amanda," which is a
sure bet to become a junior high
slow dance standard. "Cool the

Engines" and "Can't 'cha Say"
are the closest the record comes
to. perfecting the signature
Boston sound. Layer upon layer
of overdubbed guitars cushion
Brad Delp’s distinctive wailing
and help to "create the sort of
AOR nirvana that Tom Scholz
has always- aspired to. Too
much of the rest, however, is
stale and pointless. .

Most amazing is the lack of
actual material on Third Stage.
There are really only six or seven
truesongs contained in the l l
track listings. Padding out the

Third Strike

segues and a dreadful alternate
take of "Amanda" called "My
Destination.” By my calcula-
tions, eight years divided by six
songs equals l .25 songs per
year. The tragedy implicit in
these figures is that Scholz must
have really labored over this
project. But then again, no one
ever accused the guy of being
prolific.

Please don't send me letters
and postcards that express the
following sentiment: .

Dear Mr. /.VlcRoc/< 'n' Ro//,

If this record is so damn rotten,

"THE pm News, Friday, November 14, T986

how come it's No. l on every
single chart in America ( with the
possibe exception of the period-
ic chart) and has sold over .10
megazi//ion copies.

‘ Sincer/y, Bi// Braindead

Save your ink and write in-
stead to some of the wildlife pro-
tection groups and vegetarian
organizations that Tom Scholz
has listed in the liner notes. Per-
sonally, I'm going to gather evi-
dence by listening to Third Sta e
and then report Boston to t e
Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Vinyl.

PEACE SELLS  BUT

Megadeth

capitol Records

, By Ike Shibley

There is a new breed of music
muscling its way onto the scene.
It is a blend of heavy metal and
hard core which tries to bring the
two factions together on com-
mon ground. One of the leaders
in this barrage of metal-core is
Megadeth, who have recently
released their debut album
Peace Se//s  But Who's Buy-

. ing? on Capitol Records.

Megadeth is headed by Dave

Mustaine, formerly of Metallica, ‘

and is completed by Dave Ellef—
son, Chris Poland and Gar

Megadeth sings of murder,

They have stayed true to their
ideals originally conceived on

bum is hypnotizing in its direct-
ness and earnestness. lvlustaine
sings like he is in touch with what
he sings about, and that is what
makes the band mesmerizing as
well as terrifying.

This album is remarkable in its
adherance to its original intent.
Every song deals with death and
destruction in a devilishly
demonic manner. To describe
the songs does them no justice.
This is an album that has to be
heard to be appreciated.

T e album's first song on the
first side, "Keep Your Hands to

and he's great at spewing out
Southern machismo. You know,

stuff like come on baby, we N \

The band also seems to emu-

Stones’ "Tumblin' Dice.” Baird
and guitarist Rick Richards both
either sing or try to sing like Keith

The band's lyrics usually don't
go beyond pleading for sex and

"Golden Light" sounds a lot like

that the Satellites can sound ll

both play forms of-Southern

THE Pl1T News

Pitt looki n g fo r salvation against Rutgers

By John Enright

Sports Editor

The Pitt Panthers close out their
home season sched_u|e against the
Rutgers Scarlet Knights tomorrow af-
ternoon at Pitt Stadium.

Pitt (4-4-1) will try to put a halt to
its two-game losing skid against a Rut-.
gers team (5-3-1) that has lost three
of its last five games.

The Scarlet Knights started with an
impressive 3-0-1 record but have fad-
ed of late, losing games to Penn State,
Florida and, last week, to West Vir-
ginia 24-17. -

Panther coach Mike Gottfried is
more concerned with his own team's
psyche than he is with the Rutgers

ballclub.

”We have to get over the .500
mark,” said Gottfried. ”This will be
a good character check for us to see
if we can bounce back.”

Gottfried doesn't mean to say that
Rutgers won't pose problems for his
Panthers. The Scarlet Knights have
had a chance to win every game
they've played this year, with the ex-
ception of one (a 31-6 loss to Penn
State).

Rutgers’ strength lies in its balanced
attack. The Scarlet Knights average
167.7 yards rushing per game and
182.7 passing. Junior tailback Matt
Prescott (512 yards) and senior full-
back Curtis Stephens (335 yards) lead
the Rutgers rushing attack.

Sophomore quarterback Scott Er-
ney will be making his fifth start of

the season in place of injured Rutgers

quarterback Joe Gagliardi. Erney has
thrown for 720 yards this year, and,
according to Pitt coach John Brown,
he is improving every week.

”Erney had a rough game against
West Virginia last week, but the
previous week against Louisville he
threw four touchdown passes, so he's
a dangerous guy,” said Brown.

Defensively, Rutgers plays a 5-2
system led by senior defensive.tack-
le Harry Swayne, who has 39 tack-
les, four sacks and three fumble
recoveries this year. As‘ a unit, the
Scarlet Knights are indeed a team to
be reckoned with.

”Overall, their defense is an emo-
tional unit which is well-coached,
and they stay ‘with you," said Brown.
”They play well all day.”

Which is exactly what the beat-up,

_FRlDAY, NOVEM

emotionally drained Panthers will
have to do themselves to win
tomorrow.

Pitt, coming off a disastrous 37-10
loss to Miami, will probably try to
open up the passing game a bit more
this week, now that new quarterback
Sal Genilla has a game under his belt.

TheA6-3, 205-pound junior was
three for 12 against Miami for only
56 yards and three interceptions in
his college debut, replacing injured
quarterback John Congemi, whose
loss seems to have taken the wind out
of Pitt's sails.

Due to Congemi’s absence, the
Panthers relied heavily on the efforts
of tailback Craig Heyward against Mi-
ami. Heyward gained 254 yards on
39 carries in the game. This week,
though, Pitt will probably go the air-

ways more often and, hopefully,with 4 9

better success. '

Making your first collegiate start on" ’

national television against the na-

tion’s premier team isn't an idea|,sit-- I - 

uation for any player —— and especial
ly for a quarterback. Now that the first
game jitters are over for Genilla, he
feels he'll do much better V
Rutgers.

_ ”Now that we've established the P ,
run, we'll try and open up the offense 4 1 -

some more," said Genilla.

A win tomorrow would assure Pitt ' J

of its second consecutive non-losing
season. That doesn't sound like much
of an incentive, but with a program

that has gone from national recogni-‘ - ..

tion to relative obscurity in three sea-
sons, the Panthers have little else to
shoot for.

R. Scott Cornohcin/The_-Pitt News
Jerry Olsavsky, shown above returning an interception against Navy, is Pitt's leading tackler.

By Christopher Sepesy

Assistant Sports Editor

Whenever any opposing team's
offense is getting ready to play
Pitt, they're usually warned by
their coaches about Pitt's defense.
Most old-guard coaches, say, a
Lou Holtz or even a Joe Paterno,

Pitt's defense was legendary.
Although today's line may not be
as feared as 1976's, most'teams
know it is also nothing to be taken
for granted, solely because of the
players involved.

Jerry Olsavsky is one of these
players.

Olsavsky’s records, especially
this year's, basically speak for
themselves. He is the team lead-
er for tackles this season with 108
— 67 unassisted.

As a starting middle linebacker,
Olsavsky has worked his way up
since he began his college career.
He started last year as a special
team player, where he was one of
the top players on the squad with
10 tackles. Last spring, he won the
Ed Conway Memorial Award as
the team's most improved defen-
sive player. 2

Linebacker coach Chuck Claus-
ing said earlier in the year that he
feels Olsavsky to be an asset to the

A team's defensive line. '

”Jerry is one of those kids who

really knows football," said Claus-

is a mentally sharp football play-
er. He is smart, tough and very
physical. He's picked up our pass
defense very well.’’

In his four years at Youngstown
Chaney High in Ohio, Olsavsky
was a starter in practically every
game, and in his junior and senior
years he played both offense and

can remember the days when.

ing. ”He had a great spring. He '

defense. Once at Pitt, he found
things to be a little different than
what he expected. _

’’When I got here, I really’
thought it'wasn’t going to be all
that hard,” said Olsavsky. "When
I really started to_,play, boy, did my
eyes open.” _

in Saturday's game against No.
1 ranked Miami, Olsavsky was
one of the key defensive players
who gave Vinny Testaverde some-
what of a challenge, but to no
avail. -

’’I really thought we were ready,
but the first drive on defense
wasn't really that good. l think we
would have had a better chance
if we would have tightened up at
little more on our pass defense.
But hey, we were playing the No.
1 team in the country, and they

. really were good," said Olsavsky.

Right now, it is Olsavsky’s
sophomore year here at Pitt, and
since he was a player on the spe-
cial teams last year, he has seen
the coaching methods of both
former head coa_ch Foge Faiio
and Mike Gottfried. Although he
said he likes both of them ‘per-
sonally, he can find a definite
difference in both their methods
and the results. » V . ’

Olsavsky explained, ’’It seems
Mike Gottfried came in and got us
going a little more than Foge ever
could. He pepped us up and kept
us going. What we all know is this _
man is awinner, and we don't
want to let him down.

”The season as a whole I feel
could have been better, but that
is hindsight, and right now we
have to-begin looking ahead,”
said Olsavsky. ’’I do feel sorry for
the seniors this year since they
only got to see one bowl game, ‘
but that is just the way it is."

THE PIITNEWS, Friday, November 14, 1986

Naming the N FL’s best

By Thomas Danyluk

Staff Writer

Hush, hush football fans. The Kan-
sas City Chiefs, headed by a fabulous
secondary unit, are quietly coming
out of their teepees. But don't cause
too much of a commotion, or you'll
scare them back into yet another los-
ing season. After 10 weeks, John
Mackovic’s troops have charged out
to a 7-3 record, only one game be-
hind division-leading Denver in the
AFC West. Kansas City is off to their
best start since 1971, the last season
the Chiefs qualified for the playoffs.
-QB Bill Kenney, who completed 22
of 41 passes for 256 yards and three
touchdowns in Sunday's win over
Seattle, has ignited the Chiefs since
replacing starter Todd Blackledge.

Another surprise team this season
plays football in New Orleans. Wait
a second, the Saints? Yes, sir. First-
year coach Jim Mora’s club, after a
typical 1-4 start, has won four of their
last five contests, including a 6-0 stuff-
ing of the L.A. Rams on Sunday. The
New Orleans defense, which has not
allowed an opponent to rush for
more than 100 yards in their last five
outings, held Ram superstar Eric
Dickerson to 57 on 21 carries. Even
more good news for Saint backers,
QB Bobby Hebert will return to duty

after missing most of the season with
an injured ankle.

Who has the best long-ball combi-
nationin the league this season? The
Raiders? Nope. Miami? Hardly. How
about the 49ers? Wrong again. The
New York Jets, with Ken O'Brien loft-
ing rainbows to receivers Wesley
Walker and Al Toon, have been scor-
ing from way out all season long.
Sunday against the slumping Falcons,
O'Brien hit Toon for a 57-yard touch-
down, then drilled Walker on a
46-yarder to seal the Jets 28-14
victory. ‘ ~

Doug Flutie, arguably the best col-

legiate quarterback ever, made his ‘

NFL debut Sunday in Tampa Bay as
the Chicago Bears (8-2) grabbed a
.23-3 win. Replacing starter Mike
Tomczak late in the fourth quarter,
Flutie attempted only one pass,
which fell incomplete in the end
zone. Give this wizard some time,
and he'll develop into one of the
league's best — guaranteed!

Joe Montana, quarterback for the
49ers, returned to action this week,
leading his club to a 43-17 whipping
of the St. Louis Cardinals. Montana,
seemingly recovered from back sur-
gery, completed 13 of 19 tosses, in-
cluding three touchdown bombs to
fleet receiver Jerry Rice. f’I feel
good,” quipped Montana afterwards.
”N9 soreness, no pain, no problem.

Blair insists he’s‘not

Beth Froel ich
Staff Writer

Pitt's men's diving team is a very
close-knit group as far as talent and
diving perfor_manc_e are concerned.
Most of the competition throughout
the season is generated from within
the team itself. V

It is.-hard to designate at any one
time who the No. 1 diver for the team
will be. He who is on top one week
is likely to be surpassed by one of his
teammates the following week.

Even though the swim season is in
its youth, the early results indicate
that junior Chris Blair is on top. In the
first dual meet of the season against
Kent State, Blair swept the diving
competition with first place wins on
the one and three meter boards. Two
weeks prior, he placed second in the
one meter and fourth in-the three

_ Chgris. Blair-._is one-ofthe top divers on the Pitt squad. , , «

 

meter board competions out of a field
of 35 top divers at the Penn State In-
vitational.

Finishing in the No. 1 position is
new to Blair and is something that he
is definitely not taking for granted.

”Even though I won both boards
last weekend, I am definitely not the
top diver on the team. We have six
top divers,” commented Blair. ”My
teammates are the toughest compe-
tion I'll face in the Big East. Most
meets turn into inter-squad meets.”

Competing with the likes of veter-
an teammate divers Vernon Yenick,
John Dusch and two-year NCAA
qualifier Jack Shuten, it shall be in-
teresting to see if Blair can hold on
to his early season edge.

’’It is a long season. The competi-
tion between the team is tight,” com-
mented Blair. ”You can't relax and
expect to do well. If you do, there is

 

 

I was a little nervous before the game,
but that's to be expected.” Watch for
the 49ers to take command of the
NFC West, that is, as long as Smokin’
Joe stays healthy.

Here's a resounding vote for the
Miami Dolphins as Flop of the Year.
Shula’s pastel pretty—boy defense
practically donates yardage and
points to opponents each week. And
now that teams are putting the

. clamps on Miami’s famed passing at-

tack, the Dolphins have dropped to
a paltry 4-6, five games behind the
division leadingjets. Look for major
changes in South Florida, possibly the
firing of defensive coordinator Chuck
Studley or even Shula’s departure
from the team.

Perhaps the biggest upset of the
week was pulled off in Denver,
where reserve quarterback Tom Flick
and the San Diego Chargers
smothered the Broncos 9-3. San Die-
go, coming into the game at 1-7, held
the Broncos to 61 rushing yards,
while offensively controlling the ball
for almost 12 minutes more than
Denver.

2) Chicago Bears

top diver

always someone there to take your
place. The six of us could finish in
any given order at any given time.”

Blair is not consumed by the com-
petition of the sport, though. He en-
joys diving for its social aspect and
for his own self-fulfillment. ”I’ve been
diving forever, it seems,” Blair added.

Well, maybe he hasn't been diving
forever, but Blair. has been diving
since he was eight. His alma mater,
Freeport High School, had no formal
diving or swim team," so Blair would
travel to other schools’ dual meets to
compete. When he was a sophomore
in high school he was accepted to
Coach Julian Krug’s top-ranked age-
group team.

”Blair is not exceptionally talent-
ed physically. His mind, however,

has carried him and helped him to do -

things that other coaches wouldn't
have thought he was capable of,”
commented Coach Julian Krug.

One significant factor Blair had to
overcome was his lack of depth per-
ception. It is extremely unusual for a
diver to have no depth perception, as
it is a sense they rely on considera-
bly. Blair minimizes this difficulty,
saying that he had, to adjust to it in
his everyday life as well.

Blair has been with the Pitt team

or for four years now. He has one year

of eligibility left, though, because he
was red-shirted his sophomore year
due to a back injury. Sitting out a sea-
son was detrimental to Blair’ advance
in diving, but he appears to be back
on track now. ' *
Blair attributes his new-found suc-
cess to a good summer diving season.
He came closer than ever to qualify-
ing for the outdoor championships
and diving on a national level.
”My success in the summer season
got me going again. Before that time,
I was beginning to accept the fact that
I would never come close to compet-
ing on the national Jevel,” comment-
ed Blair. ~ '
Blair’ main goal for this season is
to improve his diving and to qualify
for the NCAA Diving Champion-
ships. Blair is not letting his early sea-
son success cloud his vision, though.
”Last year I only won one three
meter competition. I am not expect-
ing to win,” said Blair. ”Doing well

at the Penn State Invitational and at V

 Redmen seek respect without the ‘Truth’

By Jim U rban
Editor-in-Chief

NEW YORK CITY — Walter Berry
is ”The Truth." And it's a fact that he
was the most dominating player in
college basketball last year. Berry was
the collegiate Player of the Year. He
led the Big East in scoring, averaging
22.4 ppg and was the conference's

second best rebounder (10.5 rpg) and ,

third best shooter (55 percent). Ber-
ry paced St. John's to 31-5 record.

Unfortunately for St.»John’s coach
Lou Carnesecca, however, some-
times the truth hurts. The fact of the
matter is that Berry passed up his fi-
nal year of NCAA eligibility in favor
of the National Basketball Associa-

  
   

 John's point guard Mark Jackson will be looked to for more scoring production this year.

tion. The truth is 
gone — forever.
Now Carnesecca is left with a front
line comprised of players who have
been spectacular at times but incon-
sistent more often- than not.
High-flying Willie Glass (13.2 ppg,
5.7 rpg last year), a 6-5 senior from

”The Truth” is

Atlantic City, N.J., may be the man-

who holds the responsibility of try-
ing to fill Berry's shoes, and he does
not hide from the situation.

’’I feel I have improved very
much,” Glass said confidently. ’’I
probably worked the hardest this
summer than I ever did, and I think
it will all pay off. I will be an all-
around player.

’’I’m ready,” he added. ”Put the
pressure on me.”

Ask and ye shall receive would be
an appropriate reply from Carnesec-
ca. He is putting the pressure on

' Glass.

”He may be the sleeper,” Carne-
secca said. ’’If he shows as much im-

provement this year as he did from
his sophomore to junior year, look
out.” -

But Glass does not stand alone on
the frontcourt. Shelton Jones (8.7
ppg, 5.7 rpg last year), a 6-8‘ junior

Basketball

Continued from page 13
to the WPIAL Class AAA Champion-
ship. He is well known for his ball-
handling skills. When he was young-

er, he appeared on The Tonight Show T

and performed at college and pro
basketball games, displaying his skills
for the fans at halftime. In fact, four
years ago Miller performed at half-
time of a Pitt-Notre Dame game at the
Civic Arena.

As of now, Pitt has four available
scholarships, but Evans said that
number could reach six depending
on what happens with sophomore
Rich Carrigan and academic casualty
Marlon Ferguson. V J »

One of Carrigan’s arms is atrophied
so badly that Pitt could possibly
receive .a medical release on his
scholarship. (Atrophy is the decrease
in size of a part or a tissue after full
development has been attained.) Car-
rigan, however, would still play for
the team. '

Meanwhile, Ferguson is currently
enrolled in night courses trying to re-
gain his eligibility.

As for the new recruits, the aca-
demic status of Miller is not in ques-
tion (apparently his QPA is above a
3.0 out of a possible 4.0), but
Shorter’s situation isn't so clear.

According to Evans, Shorter’s

grades are fine, but he has yet to take
the SAT.
_ A 700 minimum score is required
on the SAT, along with a 2.0 QPA,
for an incoming scholarship freshman
to be eligible for athletic competition
his or her freshman year.

Evans indicated that he would like
to bring in three or four more play-
ers for next season. He said that he
is close to signing one of those play-
ers now, although he coyld not
release the player’s name. .

A few local players are still high on
Pitt's list including Darelle Porter, as
6-4 guard from Perry High School.

from Amityville, N.Y., along with
6-1 1 sophomore Marco Baldi and 6-9
junior Terry Bross, will also . be
looked to for help. Carnesecca does
not expect miracles, however.
”Wa|te,r Berry was a great player,”
Carnesecca said. ”You take him

- away, and not too many players can

replace him. It's like Pitt. If you take
[Charles] Smith and [Curtis] Aiken
away from them, you can't replace
them.”

So what does he do? He does the
same thing he does every year. He
doesn't rebuild — he reloads.

’’I would just say we are moving
the furniture around,” Carnesecca
said. ”Right now we are looking for
eight or nine guys that can play. Two
weeks from now, we want combina-
tions of those eight or nine that work
well together.”

One player who will definitely be
in the starting lineup is point guard
Mark Jackson, a 6-2 senior from St.
Albans, N.Y. Last year, as adept as
Syracuse's Pearl Washington was at
getting the ball to the open man, Jack-
son was virtually his equal. Jackson
set an all-time NCAA'single-season
assist record as he led the country in
that category. .

Glass may join him in the back-
court ‘along with freshmen Marcus

Broadnax, a 37 ppg scorer in high
school, and Elander Lewis. ‘

So with Jackson running the show
offensively, it seems getting the ball

distributed among his players will not 1 ‘

be a concern of Carnesecca, but get-_
ting the ball in the bucket will be.

Carnesecca said Jackson, who aver-
aged 11.5 ppg last year, will have to
score more this year for his team to
be successful. The same goes for

Jones and, of course, Glass, who is *

well aware of it. ‘E V

”Myself, Mark Jackson and Shelton I
Jones must provide the leadership if
we are going to go anywhere,” Glass
conceded. ”The younger guys, are
looking to us for confidence and a
good year.”

But the questions remain. Can it be
accomplished? Can St. John's re-
bound from the loss of Walter Berry? ‘

”Two years ago, we lost Chris Mul-
lin, Bill Wennington and Mike Moses
— three great players,” Glass said.
”This year we lost Walter Berry and
Ron Rowan, so we are just gonna say,
’Hey, weare gonna play ball without
these guys.’ " ' r .'

The truth is, Glass said, ”We can
be just as good as we were last year.”
