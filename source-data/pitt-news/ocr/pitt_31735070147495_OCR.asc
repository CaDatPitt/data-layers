The Student Government Board heard a number

of lengthy allocations requests that lasted for an I
hour and 25 minutes last night in Nordy’s Place.

The requests totaled almost $30,000.

It was only the second meeting of the semes-
ter for the new 2011 Board. Throughout the eve-
ning, Board members interjected questions and
criticisms aboutthe requests, demonst:ran'nghow
complicated the allocations process can be for
student organizations and their leaders.

In a practice new to the Board, member Mat-
thew Riehle read explanations after each vote
explaining why the Board decided to amend or
deny each ﬁnancial request that it chose not to

The multitude ofvotes .— to amend some re-

the president of Club Baseball, Rob Perkey, inter-

“Can I have a clariﬁcation of what just hap-
pened?” Perkey asked.

Club Baseball had three requests, totaling

"identiﬁed with at least one target group, which

was deﬁned in the workshop as a social group
denied access to certain beneﬁts. For example, a
certain group might be denied access to college
based on econornic status.

“Oppression targets some and rewards others
based on group membership,” said one Student
Allies Intergroup Dialogue member wearing a
name-tag reading Tracey. “It is associated with
psychological and emotional pain, but in the end
we are all allies,” she said.

Inthe postiactivity discussion, one participant
said, “The fact that we ended up on the target
side at some point says something. You can say
oppression is something you don’t understand,
but at some point you can understand it.”

Manyparticipants reported thattheywere not
afraid to cross the line, but others said they were
worried by the stigma society often associates
with some labels. ' V ‘

“No one wants to be alone,” she said. “Be-

EDITORIAL

Step away from  
the sidewalk sofa

lthough a lot of us have
Aprobably woken up after a

crazy night with someone
unwanted in our bed, the unwant-
ed bedmate we’re now concerned
about can’t be gotten rid of with
cab money.

We’re talking about the bed

I bug.
Last week, we reported that .

the bed bugs in Sutherland and
Lothrop had been eradicated.
While we tend to believe our own
reporting, we nonetheless think
students should be on the lookout
for the mattress pests since they
spread so quickly in a college en-
vironment.

According to entomologist
Ri_chard Cooper, vice president of
Bed Bug Central, a website dedi-
cated to providing reliable infor-
mation about the pests, college
campuses are the perfect setting
for bed bugs because students
come from all over the country
and world. “It’s inevitable some-
body is going to bring bugs with
them,” MSNBC reported. “And
once the bugs are introduced,
they can rapidly spread because of
all the interactions students have
visiting each other’s rooms.”_

Even if you might not be able
to see the bugs in your bed, it can
be possible to recognize an infes-
tation from itchy welts or rashes
on your body or black droppings
on your mattress.

To avoid the bugs, Cooper
suggests not introducing any dis-I
carded furniture from the side of
the road to your apartment ——
one man’s trash is another man’s
rash in this case. In addition, bugs
like to hitch rides on luggage and

backpacks, soldon’t set them on I

your bed.

And if this editorial has you
compulsively laundering your
sheets, keep in mind that it also
might be necessary to launder
your mattress. The University
used heat and chemicals to treat
the breakouts in Lothrop and
Sutherland, so be aware that you
might need professional extermi-
nation help if you come across
any critters. ‘ , _

Here are _a few bed‘ bug tips
from an Allegheny County Health
Department news release:

-Assessment for bed bugs is
simple. Shine a ﬂashlight with
a magnifying glass on all areas
of the bedroom. Don’t leave
any crevices, fold or tufts unex-
plored. ’

-If you ﬁnd infestations in your A

’AfterMLK Day, it’stime  
to seduceyour ‘sweetie’    

bed, take your sheets off and wash
them in hot water, typically above
120 degrees Fahrenheit. '

-The area around an infected
bed could also be affected. In this
case, vacuum around bed frames,
along seams and edges, behind
drapes, under carpets, inside box
springs and in ﬂoor cracks using
a wedged vacuum attachment or
a hand~brush attachment. The
vacuum bag should be removed
from the property.

-Bed bugs typically crawl up
to the mattress to infest it. To
prevent this, coatthe bed’s legs
with sticky tape, petroleum jelly
or soapy water.

-A cluttered bedroom can
make infestations worse. Keep
the area around the bed tidy, and

, make sure not to use bedding that

touches the ﬂoor. I

Bumping C-SPAN up to primetime

Considering the harshness of prevailing political rhetoric, it only seems logical to take it to the next level

Molly Green
Columnist

 

I recently decided that parliamen-
tary brawls are the best thing ever.
Because really, what could be better
than abunch of old people in toupées
and Brooks Brothers suits b*tch-slap-
ping one another in the face? _

It’s apparently quite common in
places as diverse as Ukraine, Nigeria,
Taiwan, South Korea and occasion-
ally, the Alabama state Senate. Mostly
the scuffles ‘consist-of your average
coat- and hair-grabbing, face—slap-
ping and chair—throwing. Amateur
stuff you can see at any dive bar or’
Midwestern  school cafeteria.

But occasionally, you see some-
thing with ingenuity, like South
Korean lawmakers’ creative use of
sledgehammers to pound their way
into a parliamentary committee
room‘ or Ukrainian congressmen’s
elegantly executed egg—and—smoke-
bomb ﬁght. » ,

Unfortunately, physicalacts of
violence rarely occur in the U.S. Con-
gress — at least not since the glory
days of Preston Brooks and Charles
Sumner.

Actually, I kind of wish this would

happen in our Congress, not only
because it would indicate that our
elected officials actually give a rat’s
ass about what their constituents
want, but also (and mostly) for the
sheer entertainment value.

Think of it: C—SPAN ratings would
go through theroof. Suddenly, there

- would be a reason for people to tune

in besides Michele Bachmann drink-
ing games (one drink every time she
slanders the U.S. Census Bureau;
three drinks every time she quotes
a Founding Father; ﬁve drinks every
time she accuses liberals of manu-
facturing the swine ﬂu insome se-
cret insidious laboratory to infect

the masses and thus more effectively‘
* carry out evil acts of socialism.)

If more than 5 million viewers

tune into “Thejersey Shore” weekly‘

to watch Snooki’s poof get in a ﬁght
with some drunk person who, it’s
reasonable to assume, doesn’t even
know what the U.S. Congress is,
then surely» millionswould tune in
to watch John Boehner and Nancy
Pelosi scratch it out in the hallowed
halls of our nations capital.
Just think of it: The lame—duck
_Congress is out, and a newly elected
Congress, which includes a brand-

spanking-new Republican majority
in the House of Representatives, is in.
They are hip, controversial and con-
servative. Tensions are high. Susan
Collins is feeling insecure about her
bouffant, and the Senate recently de-
feated a $1.1 trillion spending bill.

controversial environmental reform
bill. Republicans cheer; Boehner grins
more than the characters on an epi-
sode of “The Brady Bunch.” Then —
suddenly — “LuxAeterna” from the
“Requiem for a Dream” soundtrack
starts-to play. House Democrats pour

I’m thinking “The ‘West  
Wing, ” butdarker, more

sinister.

The House is dimly lit — only a
few spotlights to give the set a, golden,
somber hue. I’m thinking “The West
Wing,” but darker, more sinister. I
want to see every wrinkle, every pain-
ful memory etched into their aged
and grotesquely made—up skin. Bill
Pullman does dramatic voice-overs
in his-best Mr. Moviefone voice, while
narrating each offensive action, every
scandalous vote. Boehner sits at the
front ofthe House, sportinghis favor-
ite color of decomposing pumpkin.

In this particular “episode,” the
House has just killed a particularly

infrom the aisles. They wield leather-
backed chairs and nunchucks. Pelosi
chains herself to the House Cham-
ber Desk, and it’s on. Fists are ﬂying.
Tom Price goes onavicious rampage
whilebrandishing the House’s eagle-
topped ceremonial mace. The hall
runs red  with blood.

Truly, this could be just what
the political scene has been waiting
for. Finally, something to lure in the
younger generation —— something to
really get them interested in politics.
I’m sure the ‘CW Television Network
would just love to get its greedy little

paws on the rights to this show and
broadcast’ it Monday nights after
Gossip Girl. (They could advertise it
as “a thrilling back-to -back two hours
of vengeance and deceit.”)

In fact, there could be a whole
line—up. Why stop with in—ofﬁce

. politicians? Surely political pundits

and news anchors have just as much
suppressed rage. I’d love to see Ann
Coulter and Bill O’Reilly ﬁght it out —
everyone knows they hate each other.

' I can just hear Coulter’s annoying Kim

Cattrall slur right now (“You’re such
a savage, Bill”).

Or what about Richard Nixon
versushis entire “Enemies List”?
It would start, of course, with Jane
Fonda, who I’m pretty sure could kick
Mr. Nixon’s ass.

There is, of course, one obvious
caveat to this plan: There are a lot of
old people inthe media and U.S. Con-
gress, alike. Both Houses average at
57 years old, so the risk of serious in-
jury is increased. Whether this makes
the television too graphic or instead
elevates it to February—sweeps level
is up in the air. _

Today’s country stro

Patrick Wagner’
Music Columnist

 

Despite growing up in the middle
of Pennsylvania, I was opposed to
country music from an early age. .
Although Garth Brooks, Carrie
Underwood and Toby Keith were mu-

sical tum-ons to many, I just didn’t'

understand what was actually “coun-
try” about their angular inflections,
cowboy hats and extensive use of
rock ‘n’ roll guitar. Sure it was catchy
pop, but what was behind it?
As I’ve learned over the past few
years, itturns out there’s alot behind
country music — more than 80 years
of direct history. Stretching back into
America’s past, it’s one of the ma-
jor roots-music genres. Country is
still controversial to music fans who
mightfeel ostracized from the delib-
erately rural style or the decidedly
un—country inﬂuences it’s had over

the past 35, years or so.

But I implore you, whether you
identify  rap, classical, country
or the closely related folk genre,
to give a few of these classics from
country’s spectacular musical his-

’ toryatry.

Though not the ﬁrst country
crooner to setthe world on ﬁre, Hank
Williams Sr. is without a doubt hon-
ky-t_onk’s most legendary performer
and songwriter. Dying at the age of
29, he was notorious in his own time
for creating songs so personal you’d
believe he could see your soul and
for having a lost-artist persona that

he chronicled in his work.

Though there might be some
crack with the age of the recordings,
“I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry” still
makes any listener’s heart heavy

 

with sadness. On the other side of
the emotional spectrum, “Hey Good
Lookin’” could put Williams’ own
broad goofy smile on any fool in
love. If you get a chance, it’s worth

, looking up a TV performance of the

latter song on You'I‘ube as it shows
not only his performance chops, but
also the sheer likability of the man
and his music.

“The Green Hornet”
Starring: Seth Rogen,Jay Chou,

Christoph Waltz, Cameron

Diaz

. Directed by: Michel Gondry

Film studio: Columbia
Pictures
Grade: C+

On paper, “The Green Hornet”
seems like it should be a classic.
It features “Superbad” screen-

writing duo Seth Rogen and Evan '

Goldberg, not to mention critically

acclaimed director Michel Gondry. _

But instead the result is two hours
of squandered potential.

The ﬁlm is a new remake of the
classic 1930s radio program that
was remade into countless movies
andtelevision shows in the ’50s
and ’60‘s. Rogen plays the main

on 3-D g

i m m i c ks
character, Britt Reid, the 28-year-
old son of wealthy newspaper edi-
tor James Reid (Tom Wilkinson).

Following his father’s death,
Britt ﬁres the man’s entire staff,
with the exception of Kato (Jay
Chou), his driver. After Kato and
Britt stumble upon a ‘crime in
progress and thwart the would-
be criminals, Britt decides that
the two should become a super-
hero duo.

The catch to Britt’s heroic am-
bitions is that he and Kato plan to
disguise themselves as criminals to
better inﬁltrate crime syndicates.
Britt uses his father’s newspaper,
the Daily Sentinel, to push the im-
age of his new criminal person
“the green hornet.” ' _ '

There are moments of classic
Rogen genius in the ﬁlm, as well
‘as glimmers of Gondry’s creative
directing.‘ But the ﬁlm can’t help
but reduce itself to cheap predict-

Rogen lacks

usual charm

able humor coupled with gimmicky 3-D

The 3-D aspect of the ﬁlm doesn’t help it ‘
- in the least. In a market ﬂooded with cheesy

3-D superhero ﬁlms, “The Green Hornet”
wastes any potential it has to be a genre-
bending classic with three—dimensional
explosions.

The most unfortunate aspect of the ﬁlm
is that it delivers lukewarm performances
from all of its key players. Rogen performs
his typical lovable underachiever character, '

-but without the unscripted feel of his earlier

endeavors.

Newcomer Chou has moments of genuine
chemistry with Rogen, providing a faint hope
for a Rogen duo reminiscent of “Pineapple
Express.” Unfortunately, even the apparent
chemistry between Rogen and Chou can’t“
salvage the ﬁlm’s cliché ploys.

The few moments of genuine entertain-
ment only make the ﬁlm’s overall mediocrity

less palatable.

Gondry, whose resumé includes “The
Science of Sleep” and “Eternal Sunshine of
a Spotless Mind,” provides his trademark
idiosyncratic style, but it is overshadowed
by the overdone superhero plot and ﬂashy

_ 3-D effects. ’ -

“The Green Hornet” isn’t aparticularly
bad ﬁlm, but given the credentials of those
involved, it heartily disappoints. I

ALBUM REVIEW

Manx’s East-West blend too, bland

Liz.Keeney
Stajf Writer
Harry Manx
Isle of Manx
Dog My Cat Records Inc.
Rocks like: George Harrison
Grade: C+

With the release of his new album, Isle of '

Manx, veteran musician Harry Manx once
again tries to bridge the gap between Eastern
and Western music.

Although this mightnot exactly be choice 

listening material for the collegiate demo-
graphic, Isle of Manx deﬁnitely offers an in-
triguing blend of the two cultures. Whether it
is the best of both worlds is less certain.
. Manx’s musical talent is obviously impres-
i sive:»He plays the mohan veena like it’s a slide
guitar. And after living and performing in
Japan for 10 years and studying in India for,

another ﬁve, it’s no surprise that his love for
and skill with traditional Eastern instruments
shows. I V

Where Manx falls short, though, is with his
lyrics. Sometimes, they are the sweetly earnest
cries Western ears have come to expect from
their blues musicians." But most of the time,

 

_.,,_ J:

they’re downright cheesy.
“Tijuana,” the album’s opening track, is

, almost painful in its twangy ridiculousness.

It doesn’t help that Mamfs voice — which for
the most part has a polished gruffness that
works well with the arrangements — sounds

more like something you’d hear at a state fair
than in a song from a well-traveled musician.

Manx also loses points'for the unbearable

cheesiness of the album name itself: Isle of
Manx. (For those of you who were wonder-

ing, the album cover is a picture of an island

shaped like a guitar. Clever, no?)

On a technical note, Manx manages to
blend the two very different styles of the East

\ and the West well, but overall there’s not very

much pop. Manx takes two styles known for
their emotion and excitement and-makes them
sound just shy of dull; it’s a shame, because he
clearly has talent. Isle of Manx provides good
background music for a Midwestern yoga re-

; I treat, but unfortunately not much else. I

More reﬁned than Williams’ honky-tonk
bar style, Patsy Cline’s work represented not
just master vocal artistry, but also a shift in the
country music industry. Hoping to shed the
hillbilly image of the genre, country moved to-
ward a jazz— and pop-inﬂuenced style thatwas
appealing to adult markets and often featured
orchestral strings. , v
That’s not to say Cline didn’t have. a wide
appeal, as her voice is simply spectacular. The
rich alto on “Walking After Midnight” is justiﬁ-
ably legendary, as her bends and vibrato seem’
almost superhuman compared to the song’s
other musical elements. '
Fans of Kid Cudi might notice a sample of
Cline’s power_ful voicefrom her song “Strange”

g in the Sharam song “She Came Along,” which .
features the hip—hop artist. The original Cline .

songiis strongbecause her voice penetrates the
air like a bullet. What is impressive about Cline

is that her voice can carry through the drum
beats of the hip—hop adaptation. ’ '

Though shedied at the age of 30, Cline’s
legacy as a strong woman playing country be-

_ came a staple. Artists like the still-performing

Loretta Lynn took a direct cue from her.
Even before cutting the album Van Lear
Rose withjack White in 2o04,*Lyrmwas_always
on the cutting edge. Beyond her humble com-
posure and captivating .vo_ice, she addressed
various controversial issues in her songs. From
“The Pill” ’— which positively portrays birth
control —— to “Wings Upon Your Horns” —
about the pre-marital loss of teenage virginity
—— she wrote songs about issues facing women.
This was during a time when the Nashville es-
tablishment —- and much of the country— was
still dominated by men. s ‘
Flash—forward to Van Lear Rose and Lyrm
once again used her captivating voice to com-

 

  
   
    
  
 
  
 
 
  

Country mels well wt  other genres

municate the issues she saw affecting the world,
and women in particular. Though “Portland,

Oregon” was the album_’s lead single, this ballad .

of a one-night stand -— which features a duet
with White _—— was only a taste of what Lynn is
capable of today.

The retro background sound of “God ’

Makes No Mistakes” is particularly notable.
Lynn delivers her signature words in a haunt-
ing sing-speak that’s frank and confessional
in a way that makes the lyrics sound like laws
of nature. ‘
These three artists — and countless others
like Jolmny Cash, Merle Haggard and Vlfillie
Nelson — make deﬁnitively country music.
Though I’m not too hot on Taylor Swift or Garth
Brooks myself, I can deﬁnitely see where they’re
coming from and what monumental ﬁgures
inspired them to pick up their guitars. I hope
you can too. I

THROWING A KIRSOHBALL

This could be best Pitt team yet

Panthers look impressive as ever after getting out to a 6-0 Big East start

| Gil Brown ﬁnishes a slam dunk in the Panthers win over Syracuse M

Lauren Kirschman
Assistant Sports Editor

 

Syracuse head coachjim Boeheim

Pitt’s 74-66 win over the Orange

He said that this year’s Pitt team
could be the best one he’s seen.

Boeheim has been coaching at
Syracuse for 35 years. He’s seen a
lot of good —-— and plenty of great
— versions of the Panthers.

Since the 2001-02 season, Pitt

That team was ﬁlled with su-

well as the ultimate ﬂoor leader .

and clutch point guard in Levance

a better team during my time at
Pitt.

But I agree with Boeheim.
This year’s squad is proving me
wrong.

which offers an analysis of college
basketball statistics, Pitt is the
most offensively efficient team in
the country. The Panthers also lead
the nation in assists, assists per
game and assist-turnover ratio.
Simply put, Pitt’s offense works
— and it works well. Pitt players

are making the right passes to set '

up the best possible looks. This
was particularly evident against
Syracuse, as the Panthers continu-
ally found Nasir Robinson in the
middle, where he either had a path
for a lay-up or found an open team-

The Pitt women’s swimming and diving team,
which lost two of its three previous meets, lost

to Penn State at the Maryland tri-meet this past I

weekend, but it didn’t come out winless.
Several Pittwomen offered standout perfor-
mances that allowed the team to beat Villanova,
giving it hope as it looks ahead
In the swimming events, sophomore Kelsey

Herbst led the Panthers on her way to earning . ‘

not only Pitt’s Performer of the Meet honors but
also aﬁrst place ﬁnish in the 500 freestyle over
swimmers from Penn State and Maryland..
Her time, 4:53.40, was just under ﬁve
seconds ahead of Penn'State’s Diana Greco
[4:58.15] . Herbst says that regardless ofwhether
she is winning or losing, the 500 freestyle has
always been her favorite race. .
- “Even in high school, the 500 was always

Brittaany DiSanti:

my favorite event,” Herbst said. “I have the

_experience of beingin it for so long, and that
deﬁnitely‘ motivated_ me to pull away in the end
of that race.”

The award, which is voted on by captains ‘of » '
the team,wasn’t something Herbst considered

at all during the meet. - 3 _
“It’s‘ not something I think about,” Herbst‘
said. “I just try to think about myself and my

' body when I get up on the bloc .”

Herbst and Greco also ﬁnished inthe top two
spots during the mile freestyle, during which
Greco beat Herbstby about eight seconds. Yet,
Herbst’s time inthe mile [16:49.51] was a career
landmark.

“My mile was a lifetime best, so that was
something that was deﬁnitely nice to accom-
plish,” Herbst said. “Penn State just has a great

a swimmer in that race.”

Herbst didn’t stop there. In the 200 free-
style, she took another second place ﬁnish,

this time trailing Amy Modglin of Penn State. »
The 200 is a race that Herbst has improved in —

signiﬁcantlythis season.

“It deﬁnitely gave me‘ a lot of conﬁdence to '

know, that I "can still improve,” Herbst said. “I
just keep challenging myself and trying to do
I my best. Hopefully that motivates everyone

DiSanti is one member of a group ofyounger

“We’ve been forced to become better lead-

Just like the swim team, the diving team is
also preparing for the ﬁnal stretch. (With the
season winding down, everyone’s focus seems

DiSanti said. “We’re trying to motivate each
