the Chancellor to explore the fea v

iMoye suggests plan for Forbes Block

  Student Center proposed “

by RICH EULER

At Tuesday‘s Student Affairs Ad-
visory Committee (SAAC) meet-
ing. Dr. Alfred Moye. Dean of
Student Affairs. proposed that on
the block of Forbes Ave. between
Bouquet St. and Oakland Ave. non-

salvagable buildings be torn down '

and those that could be remodel-
ed used as a campus activi.ty cen-
ter: ' ‘

Specif'ically. Moye requested
that an International Student Cen-
ter be housed in one of the build-
ings. Other SAAC members add-
ed proposals for a commuter cen-
ter and a graduate student center.

The problem of what to do with

' the area has been an issue since
the General State Authority de-

intensive on-campus study for the
benefit of peer interaction.

A’nother essential aspect of the
program,would be a Learning Re-
source Center where students
could receive instructional ma-

personal counsel.

en: the right to control her body in regard to her re-
productive function and the public recognition in

inist Betty Friedan

From there she proposed to
move on to "a restructuring of so-
ciety around a more human order
so that woman can use her rights
and employ her abilities to the
needs of society.”

Friedan explained. that "the
concept of marriage satisfies a
need for intimacy which should
not be thrown'out with the bath-
water. Marriage is not our enemy,
And men are not our enemy either
—they are our fellow victims. Fel-
low victims in a set of binding and
stifling sex roles which say that
mama is the housewife and papa
is the breadwinner.“

According to Friedan, men and
women are becoming increasing-
ly unwilling to accept the narrow
roles depriving them of individ-
ual identities. A

She contended that‘ the move-
ment has played a vital role in this

Friedan stressed political organization as es-
sential if women are to be given the chance to ex-
ercise their new rights and participate in society.
"Through political power we willgbe able to legis-

beginning to express her hostilities in written form
in what became her first book. The Feminine Mysti-
que. After the book was published. in 1963. “women
began to realize that they weren't alone. They dis-

, covered that housekeeping was a drag for lots of
people and that no one had an orgasm while waxing

the kitchen floor." Friedan said.

“It takes two to conceive a child
and the responsibility of parenting
must be shared equally, not thrust
upon the woman.”

Friedan also pointed out that
men are rejecting the "obsolete

ing. 'I don't have to have big

too.”

Supporting their dissention.
Friedan argued.. "Why should
men carry all the responsibility‘?
Why should they die ten years
younger than women?“ .

However, Friedan forsees a

I possible danger in the search for

liberation: “a diversion by the
psuedo-radical rhetoric” which

she maintains misses the entire.

essence of the movement. “It can
do nothing but create hostility,”
she said. i '

Friedan is particularly fearful ofthis increase
in hostility. as she already sees alarming-symp-
toms of conflict between the sexes. “

cided that the University could not
‘build on the spot. Originally. the
area had been designated as part
of the Forbes Development.

Recently, Chancellor Posvar
held a meeting with members of
the Oakland community to dis-
cuss the issue. At that meeting,
both sides pledged cooperation on
solving the dilemma. However, no
definite plans for the area were
drawn up.

Moye saw several advantages to
his proposal. "We would be able
to use the existing structures with
only modest remodeling costs.“
he said- "Also, this planwould al-
leviate crowding in the Student
Union by giving students an alter-
native.“

response to a request by Govern-
noriMilton Shapp that the three
Pennsylvania state universities
take steps to the implementation
of such a program. According to
Gow, Penn State and Temple have
both organized task forces and be-
gun exploring the proposal.

Gow believes the program may
develop in one of three ways:

—Pitt; through General Studies,
could adopt and operate its own
external degree program;

——the three state universities
could organize a co-operative
program; _ \

—'the ‘State Department of Edu-
tion could ‘develop such a pro-

-‘ gram independently.

It will be thefunction of the
task force to exptore these possi-

.bilities and makela recommenda-

tion to the Chancellor.

Gow maintained that such a pro-
gram could not feasibly be insti-
tued on the graduate and under-
graduate levels simultaneously.
He surmised that the program
would begin with minimal offer-
ings and work ahead of the stu-
dent, developing more advanced
courses.»

Gow said that the“b‘uilding blocks
for such a program already exist;
it is a matter of evaluating and
combining them in such a way as
to provide the highest quality ed-
ucation as the lowest possible
price.

Great Britain has already be-
gun such a program through their
national broadcasting system, the
BBC. Their program, the Open
University, consists of a series of
national broadcasts concentrat-
ing on several.academic disci-
plines.

New York State has also insti-
tuted such a program. under the
title of the Empire State Univer-
sity. This "University" grants a
degree to anyone passing a stan-
dard qualifying exam prepared
by the State Department of Edu-
cation.

As Gow sees it‘. the challenge
facing the task force now is "can
we organize an external degree

‘Placement Office plots

   

by BOB GEDEKOH
Feature Editor

Although the opening for a gigolo has been .ftilledL the search
for a belly dancing student rages on. "We've tried our best to get
students to take the positions," said Tom Rush. Supervisor of Stu-
dent Employment. "but to no avail." Hush was,flabbergasted
‘several weeks ago when approached by a South Hills diet club
searching for a qualified belly dancer.

"Club members want to learn the mideastern art. in hopes of
strengthening their abdominal muscles. The position would require
the instructor to work three to five days a week. "The fee is com-
‘ Vpletely negotiable,” Rush added.

- “I have heard from various sources in the University that at
least three male students are competent belly-dancers, but they
just won’t come out of the woodwork,” Rush complained. “And I’m
sure that some of. the foreign graduate student s'wives could do it
too. It would be a great way to relieve the boredom of sitting around
the house, and the dancer could ‘name her own figure,”‘he continued.

"But I can’t find anyone, though I have posted the offer all over
the University," he mourned. “It's not like they would have to make
an exhibition of themselves at nightclubs."

Belly dancing is not the only strange job opening’ which has

‘ , been offered through Student Employment- this year.» "Just two

weeks ago two well-dressed, middle-aged women came into my office

looking for a ‘male escort’. a gigolo,“ Rush jovially recalled. "They

claimed that their niece was coming to visit them f'or two weeks and.

,- they wanted to make sure she had a good time.They wanted a stu-

V dent who had a car, was around 24 years of age. good looking. easy
to talk to and sexy. - '

: ' "That‘s what girls want these days.“ added a woman from the

a staff.

Members of the Placement Office staff notified several‘ stu-
dents whom they considered qualified, but none would even take
down the telephone number. “I guess they couldn’t believe that
these women would pay ten to twenty dollars a night, ten cents for
’’ every mile put on the car and all the entertainment costs.

“They thought it was just too good to be true." he sighed. The
office was unable to get anyone to-accept the position. but the wo-
m/en called back later and said that they had found a qualified ap-
plicant.

"I never thought two jobs like this would turn up.“ Rush said.

“Prior to this the strangest job offer we had was from Dr.
Omar Khyam Moore, the world-famous Pitt professor who developed
the talking typewriter which is used to teach handicapped children.
About six months before he came to Pitt we were asked to find a
bi student to ‘feed a bird and wash a monkey every day.”’

equal rights

Washington ('AP1—The Senate
Wednesday completed congres-
sional approval of a constitution-
giving women
equal rights—~including the right
to be drafted into the military
forces if Congress wishes.

The lopsided 84,-8 vote was
greeted by a high-pitched war
whoop or two from women in
the gallery hailing a triumph
at the end of four decades of
effort. The House approved it
last year 354 to 23.

The Senates action sent the
question to state legislatures
since presidential approval of the
proposed amendment is not re-
quired.

The states have seven -years
in which to act and the amend-
ment would become effective two

years after ratification by the

38th state—the minimum num-
ber required to make it effect-
ive.

The National Women‘s Po-
litical Caucus viewed the passage
of theEHAas a major victory. '

“The significance of women
as a new and powerful politi-
cal force is demonstrated by the
overwhelming margin of pass-
age of the ERA." said Rep.
Bella Abzug. D-N.Y.. co-chair-
woman of the caucus.

The caucus is now urging
women in all states to maintain
the momentum by--pressuring
for ratification ing their state
legislatures.

Tenure policy in doubt 3,.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

by FRANK HENRY

A joint resolution, calling for
the presence of non-tenure fa-
culty on committees to hear
grievances when tenure or pro-
motion has been denied by the
University, was presented at
Faculty of Arts
and Sciences‘ Council (FASCI
meeting.

The proposal. introduced by
Professors Gerald Massey and
Nehamas, conflicted with the
last meeting’s resolution, which
allowed the aggrieved three se-
lections, the administration three
selection. and one member ap-
pointed.« -

"Debate centered on whether
the aggrieved need know the
reasons and persons responsible
for the rejection. "This could
well be a preview for the April
8 full faculty meeting." said Jer-
ome Rosenburg, FAS Dean.

According to Asian Languages
and Literatures Professor Richard
F.S. Yang, "The information
accrued on the applicant is most
often a help to him and it gives
us a better method to evaluate
him fairly. This information is
essential and must remain confi-
dential. Colleagues of the appli-
cant would not give this infor-
mation if it were not for the pro-
mise of autonomy." ’ ‘

However, dissenters considered
this viewpoint as unfair to the
aggrieved. Professor Montgomery
concluded that the information
had "a way of usually leaking
out anyhow."

‘The point remained unresolv-
ed and will come before the full
faculty on April 8.

Massey stated that the new
resolution follows the guidelines
set up by the American Associ-
ation of University Professors
reasonably closely but admitted.
"It does deviate somewhat.
as we combine the separate is-
.sues of civil rights. academic
freedom and due process into
one category." '

Rosenberg also disclosed the
existence of a five member pan-
el in FAS, advising him on ad-
ministrative reviews mandated of
a positive nature. This group has
decided to remain anonymous
since members merelyact in an
advisory capacity and take no

part in making decisions.

Rosenberg contended that the

Extravaganza pats

to shame

by DAVE BLUEY

The William Penn Hotel played host Wednesday to an extrava-
ganza-”putting Broadway to shame. The event was the second show-
ing of the Pennsylvania State Lottery, a lavish production including:
a stage jammed with flashing lights, spinning wheels, colorful
balls, two pretty girls in mini jockey uniforms, a showman master
of ceremonies and, most important of all, a giant electric tote board"
flashing the winning number. . P

The show began promptly at 11 a.m., and in less than an hour, 6

some 8,000 winners were already trying to decide what to do with 5-":
their instant cash.

Amid song and dance numbers, the lottery numbers were posted A
one by one, each announcement causing a hush to fall over the g
capacity crowd. Featured guests included State Senator Frank Maz-. 
zei, who is considered the "Father of the Lottery," Miss Allegheny 
County, and a jockey- from the Meadows Race Track. The real star.
of the show, though. was the huge lottery machine that seemed to" '
gyrate into everyone’s heart.

The lottery theme, “One Out of Ten," was the overture for the
hoopla that followed. Sung by the pair of "jockettes". it began:

You can keep your Vegas, Reno ' »
Chances are kinda thin
Bingo, poker,‘ bridge and Keno
Your chance is mighty slim.
Adventurers don’t despair
Pennsylvania is the where
Each Wednesday is the when
Qualifies one out of ten.

Afterwards, the first three numbers were selected at random by‘
a spinning wheel containing a rubber ball. The girls «then livened;

The next two numbers were picked in similar fashion, with the '
final digit being determined differently. Ten envelopes, each con-' ..
taining the position of a winning horse in a Pennsylvania 
race were placed in a large plexiglas drum. These were then ran-
domly drawn and placed on colored squares mounted underneath
the tote board. "’

A juggler maze then came into play. wherein colored balls
raced to the finish line with the winning balls‘ color determining the ’ '
envelope to be opened. The post position listed inside then completed"
the winning number. I

The last digit also determined the ticket holders eligible for
the "instant millionaire"drawing. . v
.The spectacle then ended with another song,"Sudden Million-

iDlorm Security?

~. ‘ At 3 a.m. Thursday_morning several Pitt News editors entered the
Towers lobbv and found the security door leading to Tower A standing
open. None of the personnel atlthe Towers desk asked to see indentifi-
gcation. ~ '

Vi‘-Anyone, it seems.can gain access to the Towers at any time with
tlittle-or no difficulty. Witness last Tuesday's incident when several

4-

‘students were robbed at gun point in their room in Tower B.

2  According to Superintendent of Campus Police Joseph Gil and Di-
‘rectorof University Housing John Vrana. the incident cannot be blamed
-on faulty security. Both stress that students insist upon relaxed se-
./curity measures and both also explained that it is impossible to tell stu-
. ents from non-students in the lobby.

7 “The students must decide where they want to draw the first line
‘ f.defense,” stated Gil, “in the lobby, on their floor, or at the door
of their own room. Right now that (at their door) is where it is.”

'fTo,werspwould require "an armed camp.“

' /7 Both men stressed that students resent showing identification be-
fore entering. _ A

 The Pitt News has received complaints about dorm security from
students disagreeing with the perceptions of Gil and Vrana.

A "There are always people on my floor and I never know who they
._are,"' said _one Tower resident. "I get sick of having to lock my door
“every time I go to the bathroom. If-I don't. something will be gone when
Iliget-back." ‘
 just as soon see security measures start in the lobby. r.eport-
ed another resident. "I lost an $80 watch when my rooommate forgot
* to lock the door. There are a lot of people floating around here who
shouldn't be. ' —
 “I wouldn’t mind security checks in the lobby if they were uni-
form, but some students were given a hard time and others were let
through with no trouble," he added.

L A .An identification checkat peak hours may be unfeaslble. but some
»pro‘c"ess should be instituted at night.

 " ID checks are conducted in the Student Union on Friday and Satur-
day evenings with little complaint from students. Members of student
organizations’ are required to have night passes in order to remain in
the Student Union after hours. This is accepted as standard procedure.

 It is not necessary to transform the Towers into an armed camp.
fl-Jniform enforcement of existing security regulations" coupled with
maintainance of the security equipment would reasonably prevent un-
;_aut'liorized entries. I

T" yTheoretically. a student must have his room key to gain entrance
into one of the Towers. Having a student display his room key. meal tick-

 People speak, politicians listen

by DENNY KLEPPICK
Staff Columnist

A cycle has run its course. From the convention

in Chicago. 1968, we have again arrived in Illinois .

to view a political happening. The event is only a
primary. But what should most concern the Amer-
ican public is the change in the rules of the game.

The Democratic nomination has been tak-
en out of the backrooms of O’Connors‘ Last Hurrah
and given to the people.

The reforms are a by-product of the 1968 Chi-
cago riots.

At that time, the convention arrogantly pro-
claimed Hubert H. Humphrey the people’s choice
and his ha-wkish platform the national dogma. It
could not predict the anger of the blacks, liberals,
and peaceniks at being denied a voice in their coun-
try’s future.

The gray fog of tear gas cleared many a nasal
passage and induced an equal number of upset stom-

. achs. but it also stunned and shamed an American ,

public. _

A Machine politics and Daley feudalism were
seen attempting to impose their wills‘ on an unwill-
ing nation by manipulating the selection of a Presi-
dential nominee. ’

Till that time, delegates from at least 20 states
were chosen at party caucusesin state capitals. In
Georgia, delegates were chosen by the Governor
himself. Nationallyfmore than a third of the dele-
gates were chosen in 1967, before the issues and
candidates had even been identified in the public
mind. .

In November, 1970. a commission on reform
headed by Sen. George McGovern had set a number
of guidelines for the selection of delegates and con-
vention procedures. States had to abide by these
guidelines or be denied admission by the conven-
tion's Credentials Committee. «

One of the most important of these reforms
concerned delegate selection.

To reflect the national mood all delegates must
be chosen the calendar year of the convention.

In states holding primaries. each delegate must
be given the opportunity to state his presidential
preference on the ballot. He is elected on the basis
of his commitment.

In states choosing delegates by caucus. at least
75 per cent of the delegates must be chosen in open
caucuses at the congressional district level or low-
er. Any registered Democrat may participate.

' In effect this gives more accurate representa-
tion of local political strata and beliefs. In districts
composed mostly of blacks, for example, a black

. delegate has a fair chance of being elected. -

Anothermajor reform concerns the unit rule
at the convention. In 1968, if a majority of a states
delegates supported one candidate. then all that
state‘s delegates were given to that candidate. This
vastly increased the power of favorite sons or re-

gional king—makers like Daley. They had merely to _

insure that a majority of delegates were under their
thumbs and then wheel and deal. ‘

Now. for the first ballot at least, each candi-
date receives only those votes apportioned him by
thevoting public. After the first ballot the delegate
is free to shift his commitment.

The major efects of the reform, then, are these:
— a lessening of the power of machine politicians;
— a more proportional representation of racial
minorities, the young and women; . _
— a true. indication of a candidate’s strength regard-
less of Gallup and Harris public opinion polls;
— a more realistic assessment of the issues inter-
esting the voting public.

Both parties are studying the trends of delegate I

selection very closely. For once. as the_people
speak, thepoliticians are likely to listen.

Standard registration policy needed

by MIKE HOUT
The report of the Operations Task Force on Reg-

" istration and Billing was issued several weeks ago -

as reported in the Pitt News. At the open hearings.
sponsored last January by the Student Affairs Com-
mittee of the University Senate, Joseph Dutton.
Vice Chancellor for Operations. cited this Task
Force as the source of registration solutions. At
that time our committee recommended that the
Task Force be opened to include student and faculty
input. This was not done, and the finished document
suffers from the lack.

Each of the four specific objections raised be-

. low could have been modified or adapted to fit the

rules ofqthe schools and the outside hasslesfaced
by many students (i.e.. scholarship agencies). But
it is Operations‘ policy to sell the students and fac-

_ ulty their own brand of services, rather than at-
tempt to develop a mutually beneficial /system,

through, productive interaction- They insist upon
this inefficient buyer-seller relationship rather.
than one that tenders a partnership role in the pur-
suit of service to the academic mission of the Uni-
versity.

, Registration is moving smoothly this term. but
thecredit goes to the people behind the counter. not
to the Task Force. They have been working over-
time to insure adequate handling of the students.

New facilities and clerks with a minimum of five _
terms experience are-the principal factors contri-;

buting to the shortening of the lines_and the easing
of tempers. I V

4

I was surprised to discover that the most signi-
ficant improvement mention by. Dutton at, the bear-

ings was missing from the proposal. Dutton had put‘. -
. great‘ stock in the proposed switch from the flat rate
charge for full-time students to a credit hour bill-V

ing system under. which there would be a set rate

per credit no matter how many credits the student '

registers for. This suggestion makes a great deal
‘of sense, but there is no mention of it in the Task
Force proposal.

‘The tone of the proposal is its most disturbing
aspect. The Vice “Chancellor for Operations used to
be called Vice Chancellor for Finance. and this
money-making orientation of theioffice is evident
from mostof the proposed changes. Instead of com-
ing to the faculty and students with a list of changes
to make the computer better fill the needs of the
schools. they have brought forth a list of proposals
to make Operations _“financially sound." The follow-
ing l'S”a sampling of money making procedures and
specific and general objections to each:

.1) “However. it (the $50 matriculation fee) is

forfei_ted»if the student does not attend the first term
planned. ' ' ~

}_This is _an unreasonable stipulation, considering.
n the CAS rule that anyynew student "may delay.é_n.;-011-
= "“?¥'—‘ 912.‘? ‘wtiwmsr we thmirmc for vihi.ci..;hez; is

. she was accepted.

2) “All students must register in established

preregistration periods for the number of credits
,4 they expect to take. Students will lose class assign-

ments (and must ‘re-register) if invoice is not paid
by duedate (which is 10 working days before the

, start of classes).

“Student registering (re-registering) after the
due date can selectcourses (which will be held for
24 hours onlyland make arrangements to pay im-
mediately, or course selection will be reopened?

This ‘is incredibly unrealistic. Most Pitt stu-

dents receive some aid from PHEAA. This year 

PHEAA scholarships were not announced until
Sept. 15. Had this rule been ineffect this year, at
least 4,000 undergraduates would have had to re-
gister. ‘

|

3) “Waiver of Time-Related Fees; The fees,

are service" charges for special services perform-
ed." '

' 'It is agenerally held opinion that these fees
(i.e. the $15 late registration fee and the $25 late
payment fee) are fines levied to penalize students

_ who do not sign up or pay on time. If, in fact, they

are service charges and are to be treated as out-
lined in -the proposal, I think that it is the duty of the

Comptroller’ to justify the amount of these fees to’

the Deans of each school and to the Academic Cabi-

_ nets of the schools.

V » 4) “For all terms, after thetenth calendar day. I
of the term or the fifth calendar day of the session,

studentstatus for billing, loan, and statistical pur-'

poses will be based on the number of credits for

which the student is enrolledgand will not be altered I

by subsequent _dropping of one or morecoursesf’
Add/Drop lasts 10 school days, _not 10 calen-.,~

dar days.1nto each term, and five for each session.‘ .

Those students changing inthe last two or three
days of add/drop would be losing money. This is

the epitome of ‘the pursevstring serving attitude of 

Mr. Dutton and his coterie of advisors which, signi-

trar.
However, in this case students may be able to

beat the money men at their own game since there?

would be two orthree daysin which courses could

be added after the status changepdeadline. In this 
way a student may actually get away with three free =2

credits! Better’ patch the loophole, particularly if
billing by credit goes into effect.

So much for the specific criticisms. There is 

one minor looking regulation in the proposal which . '5
‘ puts the Operations orientation toward the Univer- ' ’
sity community in a one sentence directive: “The”
_, Provost. will supply the Registrar with a standard,
 University-wide QPA policy.” Rather than .. pro- -

Towers “Elevators

‘Editor. the Pitt News:
Once again. the Housing Office A

has blamed "student vandalism
and abuse“ for the current state
of repair tor disrepair. if you pre-
fer) of the Towers‘ elevators. I
for one question whether the
"vandalism and abuse" causes
the breakdowns. or the break-
downs cause the abuse. Have you

. tried getting an elevator in Tow-

er B on the weekend lately?
You're lucky to find even one op-
erable. And its justwondrous fun
carrying suitcases. etc.. up those
wide. well—lit Towers stairwells.
Maybe they ought to shut Messrs.
Vrana and Hughes in one of their

~ mistreated elevators with about

10 other people. and when the
thing decides to go on strike. have
the genial fellow at the desk in-
form themthat it’ll be an hour be-
fore they can get.out because
"the repairman is out to lunch
right now and cant be reached."
(No. it only took them 52 minutes
to get us out.) See how long it
would take them to start abusing
the elevators. Or another idea-
why not put the Housing Offices
up on the 22nd floor -of Tower

' B? Let them use the wonderful

elevators for a change and then
decide what causes what.

It was suggested that the eleva-
tors might have to be shut down. I
wonder just how many dorm stu-
dents would complain if this were
the case; assuming. of course.
that the atrocious room fee was
cut by an appropriate amount.
But then. that‘s too much to ex-
pect here at Pitt. They‘d probably
increase the room rate and tell us

it was a physical education fee.

Petitions defended 1

Dear Editor:

In the Friday. March 17. edition
of the Pitt News appeared a letter
by a John H. Hohman. who claim-
ed that those who circulated peti-
tions to have Communist Party
candidates placed on the ballot in
Pennsylvania in the November
election were guilty of. in his-
words. "blatant deceit" and "mis-
representation of their purpose."

It is indeed unfortunate and per-
haps pathetic that a college stu-
dent. and one as concerned with
virtue and as bubbling over with
moral indignation as Mr. Hoh-
man. could be so quick to spout
off and pass severe judgment on
others without first checking into
the facts. Mr. Hohman bases his
slur of the petitioners on the con-
tention that the Communist Party
"already has the right to appear
on the ballot." and that "there is
no discrimination against the
Communist Party which prohibits
them’ from running in Pennsyl-

Vania.“

Mr. Hohman is guilty of indulg-
ing in factual inaccuracies. In
point of fact the Communist Party
is illegal in Pennsylvania and is

_forbidden by law to run candi-

dates. The so-called Musmano
Law (Title 18-3811). which has
been in effect in.Pennsylvania
since 1951. outlaws the Commun-
ist Party within the boundaries of

yania and prohibits" Communist
Party candidates from appearing
on the ballot in elections.

The petitioners committed no
deceit. no misrepresentation. no
deception against Mr. Hohman or
anyone else. The idea behind cir-
culating the petitions was to test
the validity of the Musmano Act
and to establish for the Commun-
ist Party. the right to appear on
the ballot in Pennsylvania in the
November election. It is expected
that since the petitions with the
required number of signatures for
fulfillment of the candidacy re-
quirement in effect for all other
parties have been presented to’ the
election officials. the Musmano
Act will be enforced and these
candidates will be refused a place
on the ballot. In that event. a test
case will ensue between the Attor-
ney General of Pennsylvania (who
must enforce state law)~ and the
Communist Party. whose side will
be represented by the American
Civil Liberties Union. If the state
government decides not to enforce
the Musmano Act. that law will
become effectively null and void.

But in either case this matter
could not have been brought to a
head without the -collection of the
signatures on the petitions. True.
thepetitions were normal peti-
tions of candidacy. But "under pre-
sent state law, a Communist can-
not be a candidate for office.

If Mr. Hohman has bothered to
look into the facts instead of being

‘quick to shoot from the hip he

would have realized that the pe-
titioners were. as they claimed to

be, trying to establish the right of-
Communist Party candidates to

appear on the ballot, a right they
do not legally have at present.

Although I am not nor ever have
been a member of the Communist ,
Party or any other organization ‘
officially regarded as subversive. 5

I nevertheless support the efforts

of any group or any individual to . .
secure the “equal protection un- .-
der law" which the 14th Amend- '

ment guarantees.

Sincerely.

lPittshurgh artists rev ral

immense imp rovemeiit

by DEAN SIEGAL

Art no longer means a "pretty" picture although we in the
United States have been brought up to believe in this ideal defini-
tion of a work of art. Today. in fact. art is almost the opposite. It
is no longer only something pleasant to view; it may even be an un-
pleasant sight. Basic and tonal colors are no longer the only type
used; and art no longer must remain stationary. In short. art has
become more than just "entertainment" for the more serious Ameri-
can public.~ -

Both traditional and modern modes in art are displayed at the
Sixty-Second Annual Exhibition of the Associated Artists of Pitts-

~ burgh, showing through April 20.

The Pittsburgh Underpass, by Harry Scheuch, a native Pitts-

I burgher, is by far one of the most outstanding works of this show.

The forms and figures appear rounded in shape, and a mood of
quiet solitude is well portrayed by tonal color, lack of human ele-

“ments, and a sign without any writing. Classification of this paint-
- ing in terms of modern or traditional forms is difficult, for the ans-
- wer lie’s somewhere in between.

Phyllis Kindler. Herbert Olds. and Edith Knorr Ol‘Loughlin con-
tributed much to the show with their quality artwork. The warm
colors and nostalgic impact of youth are shown in the watercolors
of Edith O’Loughlin.

Herbert Olds, Sage XII, is a fine charcoal drawing of an old

. man. Although only black chalk on beige paper is used, each line

is expressive, and the work appears with as much appeal as if
done in color. _
Anna Marie Schnur’s work may be given the title "The poor

.man’s Andrew Wyeth“. Her simple paintings are homey subjects:

Upon first glance. one realizes

the kitchen, a brick house. the fog.
making one like and appre-

something about her work
ciate it.

The only "modern" pieces in which I found any skill were the
working lucite models of Aaronel DeRoy Gruber. another award-
winning Pittsburgh artist being displayed at the gallery.

  Still life’ exhibit clicks

by DEAN SIEGAL

After its beginnings in the ear-
ly 1800’s. photography was

thought to be a medium for re-'

cording and reporting on peo-
ple. places, or things. As ‘this
skill developed, it became more
concerned with aesthetic quali-
ties like'mass. value. line. and

_color. therefore acquiring many

of the qualities present in a
work of art. Many years have
passed since that time. and pho-

tography has now become an art‘

in its own right. _
The Fifty Ninth Pittsburgh In-

ternational Salon of Photogra-'

phic Art 1972 is now on display
through March 26th at the Mus-
eum of Art, Carnegie Institute.
There is one word'suitable for
describing this exhibition: sup-
erb. ‘

The show seems to focus on
what is presently happening
around the globe. It contains a-
few, examples of pictorial photo-
graphy from the first halfof the
twentieth century with the ori-
ginal cameras used by the hob-
byist and pictorialist of that per-
iod. A look at the size and in-
tricacy of these cameras im-
presses one‘ with another attri-
bute of the early photographer-

his ability to achieve pictorial

success with an instrument of
such caliber and size.

The photographs which could
be listed under “NOW” include
subjects of urban renewal, a
comparison of the old to the new,
blackness, studies of the new
black awareness, modern archi-
tecture, and pollution.

lenge.

There are many other extreme- .

ly talented photographic artists
displayed at this show. Most of
the photographs are indeed note-
worthy. Their quality lies in the
mood and tone of the idea which
each photo has captured. The

true beauty of the world has been‘

expressed with "still life." qual-
ity. If this “still life“ idea is an
essential quality in a fine pho-
tograph. the exhibit has most
definitely succeeded.

‘ Although I am not a photo-
grapher, I found extreme plea-
sure and interest in this exhibi-
tion. I sincerely urge all photo
buffs, and even those who_ are
not. to attend- this excellent dis-
play. It‘s an inspiration. ’

Neoclassical drama

<«'x

by BOB GEDEKOH
Feature Editor

In these times which have
heral_ded such films as A Clock-
work Orange, Straw Dogs and
the Polanski MacBeth, the gore-
filled British Broadcasting Corp-
oration production of Elizabeth
R and the recent scandal sur-
rounding the Surgeon Generals
report on the effect of TV vio-
lence on children. it seems quite
natural that Jean Racine’s An-
dromache be chosen for the lat-
est Studio Theatre production.

Just as we are concerned with

the violence evidently an inte-

gral part of “human naturef’,
so were the "seventeenth century
French who viewed Racine’s
play. and the classical Greeks
who provide the dramatic basis
for its plot.

Andromache concerns the most
overwhelming demand human
society places on its members.
that men be men and women
be women. And the generation
of Greeks which are the subject
of the play closely resemble to-
days youth. - 5
g Like ourselves they are the
first generation after a great war
(in their case, the Trojan War.
and in our case, World War II).

Bathed in the limelight of their
parents’ heroics, they buckle un-.
der the demands of masculine
and feminine" stereotypes as we

do today. The Agamemnons and-‘

Odysseuses of that world have

become the Eisenhowers. Pat--

tons and MacArthurs of ours.

The timeless relevancy of the
play convinced director J. W.
Schlotter that it merited produc-
tion, and so it has become the
first neo-classical drama the Stu-
dio Theatre has attempted.

And a fine attempt it is. The
aura of tension never escapes
the theater, for it is carefully
maintained by_the forceful. yet

controlled performances of the‘

entire ‘cast- Witness Alice La-
Rosa's performance as the child-
like Hermione, alternately be-
trothed and cast away from her

lover. King Pyrrhus. LaRosa han-
dles the many switches from
hope to dejection with ease and
is perfect as a childish, selfish.-
jealous. and vain woman using
her sexuality to manipulate _men.
Her performance is certain to
set all good Womens Libera-
tionists’ blood aboil.

Ever eager to display his mas-
culinity. regardless of the cost.
Orestes, as portrayed by Richard
Applegate. is easily tricked by
the conniving Hermione 0 into
wreaking vengeance on her way-.
faring lover. Applegate's por-
trayal of a he-man gone mad is
made credible by the confi-
dence with which the part_is
handled.

Edwin Rupert, who plays Py-
rrhus. King of Sparta. is excel-
lent as a weak man in a posi-
tion demanding a strong one.
While his heart leads him to
love the Trojan captive. Andro-
mache, his sense of duty and
his counselor remind him
of his betrothal to -Hermione.
and .that he should wed her for
the good of the state. Unfor-
tunately, Pyrrhus regards Her-
mione as a genuine painus rum-
pus. The haughty mannerisms
and speech which Rupert has af-
fected emphasize the nobility of
the King..

Perhaps the best performance
of all is that of Kathleen Conlin
as the captive princess, Andro-
mache. The princess must decide
whether to wed Pyrrhus whom
she despises in hopes of saving
her infant son’s life or to sacri-
fice herself and her son by re-
fusing to wed out of respect for
her dead husbandlﬂector, who
fell at Troy. Conlin portrays the
anguish of this decision, not with
the histrionics often character-
izing the attempts of amateur
actresses in such roles, but with
a restraint adding much power
to the play. - =

The supporting cast perform-
ed equally well. Cathy Sakin por-
trays «Cleone, confidant and ad-
visor-to Hermione, with an icy

maid school teachers inflicting
themselves on pitiable American
schoolchildren. The mere sight
of her stern face is enough to
make any former schoolchild's
hair stand on end. (No offense
meant to the actress who is
quite pretty "when out of char-
acter.) .

Jocelyn Johnson portrays An-
dromaches faithful servant Ce-

phisa. and is perfectly cast as A

the meek yet wise advisor. Her
performance contrasts beauti-
fully with that of Cathy Sakin.

Steve. Pelligrino and Barry
Klassel. as. respectively. the ad-
visors of Orestes and Pyrrhus.
clearly represent the pres-
suresof society on their masters.
Klassel's brooding performance
as the advisor who "walks soft-
ly but carries a big stick“ clari-
fies the dramas entire point.
The two advisors attempt to
force Orestes and Pyrrhus to act
as noblemen are expected to act.
just’ as Cleone and Cephisa try
to force Hermione and Andro-
mache to love and hate as best
benefits themselves.

».,‘,In an effort to get some needed outdoor practice and
xhibition contests. the Pitt baseball team departed this
orning by bus for a weeklong stay in St. Petersburg. Fla.

 Coach Bobby Lewis hopes that his squad can parti-
ipate in as many as a dozen games against several ECAC
(Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference) clubs and the
Pittsburgh Pirate Class A (minor league) rookie team.

~ j‘St. Johns. MIT. Long Island University. NYU. and
Massachusetts will all be staying in the same dorm com-
..plex with us down in St. Petersburg." explained Lewis.
There's also ‘a chance that we will play a night game
fgainst St. Petersburg J_unior College.

'1 “We’ll have plenty of games. I personally wish we
ould play two a day, but I don’t know if our pitching staff
11 hold out_.” . ' A

Although the mitters will be stationed in St. Peters-
burg. Bradenton, the Pirates‘ training site is only 30 min-
"tes_away. Since Lewis is taking 28 ballplayers on the
p. he indicated that he may "even split up the ‘squad
nd play two games at once."

KP _rp_ose Fields. Lewis feels the Florida excursion will en-
ble him to pare down the team roster.

Virginia. April 3. The Mounties humiliated the Panthers
in last year’s diamond inaugural. but Lewis attributed this
defeat toseveral factors. .

"We just weren't prepared for West Virginia last sea-
son. We didn't get enough outdoor practices in. Whats
more. West Virginia already had 10 contests under its
beltfbefore playing us last year.

“Next .Monday’s game should be a good one. West
Virginia will have had 15 regular games. They l(WVU)
were down south a couple weeks ago. West Virginia, like
Duquesne, finishes its schedule the first week of May.”

Only four mitters have a lock on starting positions.

- Captain Ken Macha (IB). Bob Livingston (2B). Guy Cap-

arelli (C). and Dennis Toboz (LF) are assured of being
in the lineup against the Mounties.

Harry Pardini and Scott Sufrin (CF). Len Raffa and
Ron Barrett (RF). Paul Seneca and Ed Banaszak (SS).

and PauljQuarantillo and Danny Slain (3B) are all en-' _

gagedin hotly contested tussles at their respective posi-
tions. ' - ' \

Several freshmen have impressed Lewis ‘after three
weeks of indoor workouts.

"Rick Monroe (Peabody). Tom Miller (West Mitiflin):
and Joe Groetch (North Catholic) have all looked good.'
commented Lewis. "All three are very versatile and can“
play either infield or outfield.

"Another good prospect is Donnie Siegel. a high school

teammate of Groetch's. He (Siegel) was an exceptional
pitcher for North Catholic. He will join the team in April

‘-.-. after he isfinished with spring football.”

, Moundsmen Mike «Niccols and Al Sylanski will anchor
the pitching corps. The Fedoris - brothers. (Mike and
Andy), Bill Schamott, Bill Donovan, and Milan Popovich
are competing for the remaining hill slots. /‘

J

In Assistant Coach Al Smith, Lewis has a "big help.“

A former college mitt coach, Smith is an assistant athletic _

director at Pitt and Lewis is grateful to have him aboard
the 1972 Pitt diamond crew.

lot of schools are trying to qualify for the'Easterns and

'the Nationals’ so they're running their best times. This

year though, a few of the schools already have commit-

ments that they can't break. They're, dying to come _

though."

. Inv-itationals appear to be in fashion these days in
both indoor and outdoor track. Banner has only scheduled
one’ dual meet (with Temple May 17) and is content to fill
the year with the bigger collections of talent.

"Dual meets are becoming a thing of the past.“ Ban-
ner commented. “It’s much cheaper to ‘send ten guys to
an invitational than send 30 to a dual meet. I can‘t see us

. everfielding a good dual meet team again." presumably
 on the funds that are available.

With this in mind, Banner loudly praises the talent
this year's squad possesses. His contention is that he has"

’ less "fellows" but more ‘quality. Assistant Coach Smittie

Brown echoes his boss‘ sentiments.

“We look real good in the distances and the middle
distanc,es,’,’ claimed Brown. “I think this year’s freshmen
have more potential, in fact twice the potential, than the
guys that came in\with my class.” Brown is referring to
guys like Jerry Richey, Bryant Salter, Dave Garnett, and
Craig Rodgers. , 8

Rich Jackson. Andre Harris.‘ Mickey Collins. Bob /
Schurko. and Bob‘ Steele are a few of the freshmen that
comprise this wealth of talent. Brow-n singled out Collins
as a boy with the potential to be another Jerry Richey and
Banner was eager to praise both Steele and the younger
Schurko.

"Freshmen have a big adjustmentto make. to go
from high school to college." offered Brown in explana-
tion for the fact that the squad still has a ways to go before
it achieves its potential. ‘

“It takes about a year to mature,” added Banner.
“Its always that transition from high school to college.
competition that gives the boys the most trouble.”

During‘ a track season that seems to never end. Ban—‘
ner is cognizant of the differences between the indoor and
outdoor campaigns. ‘

"I enjoy the indoor; circuit." smiled Banner. "It's like
a carnival circuit. Take the Pitt Invitational for example.

Remember all the people running around. I don‘t think we
could have stuffed another team in there."

“The outdoor circuit is true track. You see the kind
of events that are in the Olympics. There’s a greater
variety.” '

I Included in the “true track" circuit_will_ be events
like the javelin. the discus . and the steeplechase. The
steeplechase. for example. .was run for the first time at

DePasqua believes

in '52’ defense a
by VéNCEv %IdNARDO
ports . itor

Just because a handful of players and a contingent of
fans don't like a defensive formation doesn‘t mean that
the alignment is inadequate.

That‘s how head’ football coach Carl DePasqua feels
about the defensive_s_pread he plans to open the football .
season with in the fall.

The defense, the five—two. was inaugurated by De-
Pasqua last season and failed to be effective. In fact. the
Panther defense allowed an astronomical 35 points per
-game in ’71.

“You don’t' junk a defense because it doesn’t work
as well as you'would like,” explained DePasqua. “I think
the players have morelconfidence in it this year. Of
course, the teams we played were no pushovers. This had
something.to.do with it. I don’t think it’s the alignment so
much, but rather the personnel.” -

DePasqua might havea point there. The 52,‘as the

‘defense is also known. is used by some pretty good col-

lege teams. ' ‘K . ~

Nebraska. the National Champions; Lousiana State,
perennially tough in the Southeastern Conference. and
Stanford, victors in the Rose Bowl. all use the defense."
which requires three down-linemen and two linebackers.

. According to defensive tutor Ralph Jelic, the return-
ing defensemen are accepting the challenge this year. ,

"They "(the players) aren’t very proud of last years I
slate. The first day we got together George Feher decided
it was time for them to set new standards.“ noted Jelic.

~ Feher.,one of last year‘s returning linebackers. set
the mood for those rejuvenated standards when he .told
his teammates: "Lets not fool around. Let's start on the
first day to'set a new image for ourselves.“

And even though Ralph \Cindrich and Joe Carrol will
be missed, DePasqua likes the personneland their optimis-
tic desires. ' I ~

“The_ kids have a great attitude. a.n exceptional at-
titude." said the gray.-haired mentor. "and while I‘m
never fully satisfied. I am presently satisfied with the
play of the defense."

the title contest while Indiana
sports an 8-1. The skaters -ad-
ministered a 6-3 lashing of Indiana
earlier in the season for the lat-

a lackluster affair, however. as
Pitt skated their poorest team ef-

Ready or not it’s here—yes, it’s finally spring again. Whil—e
some of us are still trying to comprehend the idea that finals
are just around the corner, others are contemplating other prob-
lems. I ‘

The '72 Panther baseball season has arrived. That in itself
is not a problem. Unlike some Pitt teams, the mitters are win-
ners. Their record last season was 18--8. The difficulty will be

ing. _ . .
Head baseball coach Bob‘ Lewis will have some very im-

— portant decisions to make during the mitters‘ ‘southern tour in’

Florida next week. Some key positions are now vacant and have
to be adequately filled.

With the graduation of Bob Solonickne, a tremendous gap I

has been left to be filled in right field. Solonickne, an All-Star
player,'was the second to Ken‘Macha on the team in the batting
department, clubbing outan average well over .300.

“Sollie was always good for a .350 average or better," com- I

mented Lewis. "I~ could always count on him knocking in a lot of
runs for us." ' - ‘ ' ‘ -

_Only one player, Dennis Toboz, has an outfield position nail-

ed down; the other two spots are up for grabs. Trying to nab‘-‘

one of these spots are Harry Pardini, who saw action in the
outfield last year, Scotty Sufrin, Dick Fisher, Len Raffa, and
last year’s backup catcher, Bill Schmitke. —

With an ace -catcher like Guy Caperelli returning, there’s
no way Schmitke would see action behind the plate. Lewis’ de-
cision is to see how~well the ex-catcher can do in the outfield.

An even tougher hole to fill is at shortstop. When junior Ter-
ry Stokes signed with the Boston Red Sox‘, Lewis lost one of
the best Panthers that every fielded a_ baseball. Not only did
Stokes have a golden glove, he was also a star hitter. And once
on base, he had_the speed to really move, stealing more bases
than any Pitt mitter last year. '

l"I was confident with Terry.“ stated the Pitt mentor.
"They’re pretty big shoes to fill, someones going to have to.
pick up _the slack.” j_ _ I - *

That “someone” might be either (Paul Seneca, returning

from last year’s team, or Ed Banaszak who is a junior college I

transfer student from Robert Morris.»

In. the pitching department, it is “win some, lose some" for
the Panthers even before the start of the season. Mike Niccols.
'71 ace pitcher of the Pitt squad witha record of 5-1 andan ERA
of 1.97, hasgained another year of eligibility. This will certainly
help beef up the pitching staff, which already has good hurlers in
Albie, Sylanski, 5-3 last year, Mike Fedoris, and Bill Schamott.

Not returning, however, is Rich Muse, who was Lewis‘ best
left hander last spring. With the loss of Muse. Lewis loses a fine

"pitcher and also his only southpaw. Muse, a sophomore, dropped

out of school in October to become eligible for the pro draft.
The rule reads that if a player leaves school, he is eligible to be

 _ drafted after 120 days. i -.

  

“We were really counting on Rich, but I don’t think his drop-
ping out will hurt us too much,” related Lewis. “College base-
ball doesn’t get that technical. I think a good right handed pitch-
ercan get out a good left handed‘ batter.” ‘ V

_ Even though Lewis does not think this toibe avery. pressing. A

I s    on W102.   

for Indiana to consider. The mam-
moth defenseman missed the last
two games of the regular season
due to spring football practice.

Even without Hyde, Pitt boasts
the largest team, man for man, in
the whole league. But what Indi-
ana lacks in size against Pitt, they
hope to make up in speed. Indiana
is perhaps the fastest in the
league and one skater to watch
particularly will be Pete Hanson.

Last Sunday Indiana squeaked
out a 4-3 winover St. Vincent
College in,Greensburg. Hanson
scored with"only 21 seconds re-
maining’ in the game to salvage
the win.

Over the season, Pitt holds a .

fairly large statistical edge on In-
diana. In 10 contests Pitt has
scored 79 goals while having only
18 scored against them. Indiana,

, in nine games, has talliedi 51 goals

while having 25 scored on‘ them.

All of the Pitt skaters are in
good healthand will be ready for
Sunday’s game.~ Winger Frank
Williams returned to the lineup
last Tuesday after missing one
game and scored two goals. The
line of Williams, Bill Glanville,

Indiana. . 3

and Denny ‘Browne, the highest '
‘scoring line in the league, will

be reunited for the title contest.
Optimism is running very ‘high
on the Indiana team and the skat-
ers should be mentally prepared
for Pitt. .
"‘If we don’t make the mistakes
we made last time I know we can

take them,” remarked star for-

ward Hanson.

On theother hand, Pitt player-
coach Phil Gefsky is confident of

his team’s ability. “C-MU was V

  Latecomer proves

by MARTY HELLMAN

Goldie Edwards is a good example that it is
never too late to learn.

Seven years ago, Edwards began playing squash
when she arrived at Pitt and she now ranks among
the top five in the country. - ‘

Edwards, anlassociate professor in the wom-
en’s physical education department, has overcome
several disadvantages on the road to nationwide
prominence. ' . 5

_ “I’m combating age,” chuckled the slender Ed-
wards. “You know, I’m not a spring chicken—I
play women 15 years younger than I.”

Ironically, competing in the Pittsburgh area
has worked both ways for her. Though faced with a
dearth of ‘top-notch women players in the area. Ed-
wards has benefited from competition with area
men. ' ' ‘ ' ’ ,

"Pittsburgh is the only area I know of where
women are accepted to play with men in clubs and
tourneys. One of the reasons that I have improved
so much is that I‘ve been able to play against some
of the top men in the country.

.“In fact,” she continued in her distinct British .

accent, “I was invited to represent the Pittsburgh
team in at tourney last week—that’s indicative of
everyone’s openness.” = _ '
Next August, Edwards will represent the USA
squash team on a tour of Australia. She'll be return-
ing to her native area of the South Pacific, as she
lived most of her life in Auckland, New Zealand.

Edwards attributes the life style of New Zea-

land for her enthusiastic outlook on sports and phy-’ L

sical health. _

“Sport'has value in the community ther'e—pe'o-
ple don’t go and watch,‘ but they participate them-
selves. People don’t have as many diversions there
and there are a lot of outdoor facilitiespwith the

small population.” ' _

Before coming to Pitt: Edwards competed in
competitive badminton_and tennis to give her a
strong background inracquet ‘sports. Although she
is unable to compete on the state and’ national level
in tennis, she is proud to state that, “I've won all
of the tourneys around here at one time-or another."

p Edwards’ squash achievements ‘since 1969 are
outstanding. She has won the New Jersey state
crown three straight times, the Massachusetts title
twice straight, and the Canadian open twice.

‘In last year’s US tourney, she finished second,
but lost in the semi-finals this year. She admits that
her recent showing was a big disappointment, but

. she refuses to alibi for her performance. ' ~ ‘

Spikers in tourney  

out its premier season as ‘a newly organized club sport with an
all-day match at the’ Penn Hills High School gymnasium. this:j"
Saturday morning at 9 a.m. V .
The match. sponsored by Community House. will field teams
from the tri-state area. - Various divisions .will include men's
squads. ’women‘s squads. and a league consisting of basically»-'.
YMCA teams from the area. . , ‘ 
The Pitt squad will participate with the YMCA league since."  _.
the club does not belong to any collegiate group at this time.. 
Freshman Al Freilander, organizer of the club, hopefully feels
that the team will join with‘C-MU, Penn State, and Slippery Rock 
in’ organizing a collegiate club volleyball league by next year. This 
league should very closely resemble the club hockey league.  I-A
Freilander admitted that the club was at first hampered by a‘ :1 
lack of interest from the student body but he presumably felt that 
this was due toasmallamount of publicity the club received. 1' _ 
Hopefully. as interest gains. the club will join the ranks as a. 
member of the NCAA and lose its club standing. To do this the
spikers must become sponsored by the Athletic Department.
