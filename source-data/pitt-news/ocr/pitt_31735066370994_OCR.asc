Farrakhan

softens

By David Zafris
Staff Writer

Minister Louis Farrakhan spoke last
night to a sold-out Fitzgerald Field
House, and despite community tension
and threats of violence by extremist
groups, the entire event occurred
without incident. .

Farrakhan devoted much of his
speech to clarifying his alleged anti-
Semitic remarks, but his main point to
students was that knowledge is the key
to black economic development.

Farrakhan held a book up to the au-
dience and said, “See that book? It
looks like wings, and these are the only
wings that will cause you to ﬂy.
They’re the wings of knowledge, so
you go open your book.”

Speaking to a predominantly black
audience, Farrakhan was interrupted
several times by applause as he urged
the audience to advance its knowledge.

“Don’t be a quoter, be a thinker,”
he said. “And when you read what
your teacher wrote, question it. And
when it doesn’t sound right, make him
prove it. Advance yourself in
knowledge, advance your discipline,
advance your people.

stance

 America might be
getting stronger internally
when the burden of 30
million [blacks] can
shoulder their own
weight. ”

—— Louis Farrakhan

“And when you do this, use your
knowledge to lift up,” Farrakhan con-
tinued. “Never use your knowledge to
say ‘I am better than the one that does
not have it,’ ” he said.

“Take knowledge —— serve yourself,
serve others, lift yourself, lift others,
take yourself, unite with self, protect
self, determine direction for yourself,
and stand up for yourself. Be willing
to be called whatever people want to
call you as long as you know who and

‘what you are, it don’t make no dif-

ference.”

Farrakhan told black students to use
their educations to develop the black
community, and to make blacks
become more independent.

Law school, provost
seek to end conﬂict

In the aftermath of Dean Richard
Pierce’s resignation last Monday, the
Pitt law school faculty steeringAcom-
mittee, and university administration
ofﬁcials have been meeting the past few
days to quell rumors and reconcile sen-
sitive points of contention.

Professor John M. Burkoff, presi-
dent of the law faculty steering com-
mittee was optimistic: “We’ve been
having frank and candid discussions
[with the university administration].
The Provost’s office has been willing
to talk about anything and we’re put-
ting together a process to work
together.”

Pierce reportedly resigned because
the administration was not forthcom-
ing with budget allocation requests he
had made. Pierce had extensive plans
for improving the school, which he
outlined in a report to the Provost’s of-
fice upon assuming his position in
July 1984.

“We’ve talked to [Provost Benjamin
and Associate Provost Ahlbrant] about
a number of problems in ﬁnancing,”
Burkhoff said. “We’re working on
what particular problems there are and
what we can do about them,” he said,
adding that “the Provost’s office has
bent over backwards” to accommodate
the law school this past week.

The law school faculty and univer-
sity adrriinistration are not the only ones
who have shown alarm over Pierce’s
resignation. The Student Bar Associa-
tion, representing the law students at
large, sent a sharply critical letter to
Provost Benjamin, implying that the
administration’s failure to. meet the_law

   

 

  

school’s budgetary _needs led to
Pierce’s resignation. .

The letter was accompanied by 400
student signatures; thereaare a total of
700 students at Pitt’s law school.

The SBA has quelled rumors that
alumni funds were being unjustifiably
appropriated by the university ad-
ministration. “Any money donated
directly to the law school does reach
the law school,” said Bob Dapper.
SBA vice president.

But the SBA does contend that com-
pared to other schools, the law school

receives a disproportionately low-

percentage of tuition revenue, despite
the fact that tuition fees increased by
17 percent last year. A

“Some 52 percent of the revenu
generated by tuition fees is allocated to
the school,” said SBA president Ron
Carnevali. “Other schools get 100 per-
cent,” he said, pointing out that “48
percent of each law student’s tuition
subsidizes other schools.”

The apparent shortage, then, means
that these “hard” funds raised through
tuition fees do not cover administration
costs. Thus, Carnevali contends, phone
bills and faculty salaries, among other
administrative costs, must be covered
by the “soft” funds raised in other
ways, such as alumni contri_butions.

Ultimately, there is no revenue re-
maining for planned improvements:
“The money that is intended for such
things as expanding the library and
establishing endowed chairs on the
faculty is diverted to pay for ad-
ministrative costs in the law school.”

Minister Louis Farrakhan attracted a sell-out crowd to Pitt’s Fitzgerald Field House last night.

Speech receives positive response

By Michael Ashford

Assistant News Editor

In a quick survey of viewers’ reac-
tions to Minister Louis Farrakhan’s
speech last night, most responses were

. very positive.

“I think he’s an exciting and power-
ful speaker,” said Cynthia Marshall,
a graduate student in the School of
Higher Education. “Nothing he-said
shocked me terribly, and I think peo-
ple of ‘all races should take a lot of his
advice,” she added.

“I think I agree with almost all he
had to say,” said William Martin, a
professor ‘of geography at Slippery
Rock University, “and if people con-
tinue to put forth what he says, there
will be more peace and less hostility in
the world today.”

Some respondents were more wary
of Farrakhan’s message: “He adapted
his rhetoric to ﬁt the audience tonight,”
said Lisa Lavelle, CAS ’86. “He toned
it down. What he really represents is
the same as Jerry Fallwell,” she added.

In this survey, a majority of
respondents were receptive to Far-
rakhan’s message. “Reading the
media, I thought he was going to be
more radical,” said Andrew Kraemer,

 ’36, “but he did say a lot of in-

   

teresting things. It was persuasive and
it had some merit.”

Many of those questioned mentioned
what has previously been written about
Farrakhan in the media. “I think the
media has given him a bit of a bum
rap,” said Martin. “The media has not
reported accurately what he has to say,
and many of his statements were taken

“I was glad Farrakhan
had a chance to explain
what has been said about
him in the press. ”

—- Don Norrington

out of context.”

Don Norrington, a staff worker for
the Graduate School of Business, said
he “was glad Farrakhan had a chance
to explain what has been said about him
in the press.”

“All I’ve heard about him [in the
press] is negative,” said Marshall,
“and it wasn’t. It was positive.”

Others stressed Farrakhan’s em-
phasis on the need for black economic
independence. “He brought an impor-
tant message,” said, Robert Harris, a
former Black Studies department
employee, ‘ ‘to make black people stand

on theirbwn two feet, not to depend‘

 

on the white man or whoever it might
be, and that you have to do it for
yourself.”

Mark Debeary identified with Far-
rakhan’s words: “He has increased my
understanding of how a young, black
individual should think today. I’m
thinking about my future and my
business a lot.” V

David Mack, CGS ’88, said, “I

think anybody trying to get ahead to-V

day faces the problems he pointed out,
and that’s true for [all] people.’ I think
what he criticized blacks for was im-
portant, too.”

Still other respondents emphasized

Farrakhan’s words on international '

relations. “He’s an excellent orator,”
said Frank Habe, self-employed. “The
international problems facing this coun-

try could be tough in the times ahead, -

and I agreed with what he said about
the knowledge and power we have and
using it correctly,” he said.
"Relating to Israeli foreign policy,
Waleed Al-Atraqchi said Farrakhan
showed that “just to say ‘I hate Israel’
doesn’t mean ‘I hate Jews’ and that
Arabs have no voice in this country.”
Finally, Redda Al-Sadat, an Or-
thodox Muslim himself, said, “At least
for the part I saw, his racism has been
neutralized. He referred to humanity in
general instead of just blacks."

   

JgDO rally faces rainy

' By David Zafris

Staff Writer

Nearly 50 people gathered Wednes-
day night to protest Louis Farrakhan’s
proposed speech, but after listening to
Mordechai Levi, many of them found
themselves defending Farrakhan’s right
to speak.

Levy, leader of the New York—based
Jewish Defense Organization, organ-
ized the rally, but may have offended
the protesters with the slogans he was

_ shouting.

“Who do we want?” he said. “Far-
rakhan! And how do we want him?
Dead!” .

Pitt student Michael Wishnow said
to Levy,“What is this nonsense?
You're as wrong as he is.”

Other protesters questioned Levy’s
comments, including members from
the Pittsburgh chapter of Kach Inter-
national, an organization founded on
the ideology of Rabbi Meir Kahane.

“We’re not saying he should be
killed,” said Jay Greenwald, a
spokesman for Kach. “Our organiza-
tion believes in peaceful demonstra-
tion.”

“You can shrug your
shoulders and nod your
head, but that ’s what peo-
ple did about Hitler in the

’20s. ”
— Mordechai Levy

JDO leader

Levy later said that Farrakhan should
be put to “political death,” but posed
a question to the crowd. “Would you
be deeply hurt if Farrakhan slipped on
a banana peel and died? No, and
neither would I,” Levy said.

Levy couldn’t inspire the crowd to

_chant with him, and he said people

should take Farrakhan more seriously.

“You can shrug your shoulders and
nod your head, but that’s what people
did about Hitler in the ’20s,” he said.
“With a guy like him inciting a lot of
unemployed people, you got to believe
he can have people killed.”

“He openly said whites are devils
and the Jews have to be eradicated,”
Levy continued. “You don’t have to

be Jewish to hateFarrakhan. Don’t be
afraid of filth like him. There should
be 5,000 students protesting there
tomorrow night.”

Four students stood near Levy sing-
ing Jewish folk songs, and said they
don’t believe in Levy’s message of
hatred.

“The true issues are that racism and
bigotry shouldn’t exist in our society,”

said J her Cohn, a Pitt law student. He
said the song they were singing was en-
titled “The People of Israel Live,” and
that it stands for a peaceful solution to
their problems. _

People across the street from the ral-
ly were attending a concert at B’nai
B’rith Hillel, and Bertha Hoffrichter
commented about Farrakhan: “I think
he stinks,” she said. “I think he does

a disservice to his people. The students
who don’t want him shouldn’t have to
pay for it.”

Annette Teblow, a psych/business
major at Pitt, said the Student Govern-
ment Board is at fault for Farrakhan’s
coming to speak at Pitt. “The Black
Action Society proposed it [inviting
Farrakhan], but the SGB should have
opposed it.”

The Pitt News, November 15, 1985

By Mark Kenny
Staff Writer

Urging blacks to record the events
of their own lives before “somebody
else writes the history and wipes you
out,” writer Toni Cade Bambara lec-
tured at the University of Pittsburgh
Tuesday as part of the continuing
observation of Black Week.

Bambara, appearing as a guest of the
Black Action Society, alerted blacks to
the danger of leaving the job of record-
ing their history to a society which
systematically seeks to remove them

from the history books. “People get
disappeared,” Bambara said. “We lose
those models and all the things that go
with them. They’ become non-
persons.”

In addition, she warned against ac-
cepting media reports of incidents
which involve blacks. “Otherwise,
we're forced to accept the authorized
version, that highly selective version,”
she said. “A great deal of time, energy
and evil genius goes into making us not
know. A lot of what we know ain't
so.” "

She cited the May 13 bombing of the

MOVE house in Philadelphia which
took the lives of 11 people and, ques-
tioning what she called the “official
version” of the incident, asked the au-
dience, “We knew, didn’t we?”

Bambara, author and editor of
several books including “The Black
Woman” and “The Seabirds Are Still
Alive," from which she read a selec-
tion, was raised in New York and
graduated from Queens and City col-
leges. The self-professed belligerent
and hard-headed feminist currently
resides in "Philadelphia.

Throughout her lecture, Bambara
referred to black women of the past

whom she termed vital in their con-
tributions to the early black movement.
She referred to Ida B. Wells, a black
woman journalist of the early 1900s
whom she claimed was purposely left
out of the history books for 36 years.

Also included was her grandmother,
whom she claims was famous in her
community for throwing trolley car
drivers into the street when they would

tell people to move to the back.

To avoid what she called “whiting—
out,” Bambara stressed the importance
to blacks of keeping a daily journal for
the purpose of logging their personal
events, especially with regard to the ap-

pearance of Louis Farrakhan at Pitt.

“We are making history,” she said.
‘ ‘You are writing for yourself and hop-
ing — at least I’m hoping — that’s it's
going to be helpﬁil. ” She called writing
an act of discovery and said that by
writing for themselves, blacks would
also be writing for others.

She told black students in the au-
dience the strength they gain from the
event will be important to them, and

that their experiences will be a basis for.

the black students who follow them in
years to come. .

“In whose name,” she asked the au-
dience,  the 21st century be cloned.”

iAnti—Farrakhan protesters rally just before spech  

By John Zaphyr

Assistant News Editor

Although they weren’t many in
number, the people that turned up out-
side the Fitzgerald Field House to pro-
test the appearance of Rev. Louis Far-
rakhan got their message across.

‘ ‘It doesn’t matter how many people
are here,” said Jay Greenwald, a
spokesman for the Pittsburgh chapter
of Kach International, a Jewish
organization. “But Farrakhan’s
rhetoric must not go unchallenged.”

Most of the 21 protesters that braved
the rain and cold were upset about the
well-known, inﬂammatory remarks
Farrakhan made about the Jewish com-
munity, but were also angered that the
University of Pittsburgh allocated funds
to bring him to the campus.

‘ ‘We’re not just protesting Farrakhan
but we’re also protesting the universi-

V ty,” said one Pitt psychology student.

“The whole concept of bringing him
into the university with our money is
not right. I also think it was unfair of

the Black Action Society to bring him

-here.”
Greenwald echoed the thought.
“The university made a mistake in

bringing him here,” hesaid. “The-

students’ fees should not be made to
pay for his speech and the taxpayers of
this city should not be made to pay for
the security used to protect him.

“If he wanted to speak here he
should have rented out Soldiers and
Sailors Hall with his own money and
not with the students’ money.”

The protesters also were against Far-
rakhan’s remarks.

“We’ve cometonight to protest the
inﬂammatory remarks he has made

Dapper said.

The SBA and students at large fear
the consequences of Pierce’s resigna-
tion. The law school has had a grow-
ing reputation for excellence over the
past few years, ranking among the top
20 percent of law schools in the nation.
The SBA doesn’t want that progress to
be halted. “We fear Dean Pierce will
not be the last to leave, but that also
some faculty might leave,” said
Carnevali. “We are a school of young

against our part of society,” said one
Jewish protester. “It is a ludicrous
thing for him to attack a group that has
had to suffer the same inequality and
same racism that hisown part of socie-
ty has suffered.”

“We had to do something to protest , ‘

Farrakhan’s coming because there was
really nothing else we could do to voice

our opinions,” said Pitt senior Mindy -

Frohlich. “His being here puts the
Jewish community of this university in
a bad position. I’m really not against
his being here, but what he says.”
Some people, who were waiting in
line to get into the Field House while
the protesters carried on their
demonstration across the street, voiced
their displeasure at the demonstrators.

“I think it takes a lot of stupid peo-
ple with a lot of stupid minds to pro-
test someone they have never seen,”
said Abdul Muhammad. “I think they
need to see Farrakhan before they make
a judgment. I think they’re the ones be-
ing prejudiced. All we want is the 40
acres and the mule they promised when
they freed the slaves — actually you
can keep the mule and just give us the
40 acres.”

Although many of the protesters
wielded signs criticizing Farrakhan and
his ideas, there was no violence.

“This is a peaceful demonstration,”
said Greenwald. “We’re not here to in-
cite tempers or to inﬂuence others’
thinking.”

Greenwald also said that he didn’t '

agree with the radical Jewish organiza-
tions that use -violence in their
demonstrations.

“I don’t agree with the violence, but
I do believe in his facts,” he said.
“Farrakhan is a violent man with
violent'ideas. He is anti-white, anti-
Jewish and anti-American. ”

Greenwald was also disappointed in

the other Jewish organizations that did

not openly protest Farrakhan’s arrival. .

‘ ‘A lot of students would have come
out but they were afraid, and there is
nothing to be afraid of,” he said. “I’m
mad" at the Jewish organizations that
stayed in the background and didn’t

come out and educate the public about

this man.

scholars establishing themselves,” he
added, pointing out that such a faculty
is more likely to move on if oppor-
tunities and resources run short. _
After meetingrwith Provost Benjamin
yesterday, Burkhoff said, “Those

' kinds of worries are premature. Out of

what really is a sad occasion, good
things will happen because the law
school and university administration
will now establish a working
dialogue.”

All sides in the affair have expressed
their regret over Pierce’s resignation.

On Tuesday Provost Benjamin said,
“Dean Pierce is an excellent academi-
cian, has done a good.job as dean, and
the university has suffered a great
loss.”

Third—year law student Richard
Sedory contributed to this attitude. say-
ing, “It will be sad to see him go
because he has done an outstanding job
at the school.”

“Lots of promises were made by the
university administration when Pierce
took the job,” said Carnevali, “and no
actions were taken. Now it’s too late.”

“The Hillel encouraged protesting
through statements in the papers, but
they just didn’t do enough,” Green-

One protester who did do enough
was Maureita Gilmer — who stood out-
side protesting even though her son was

“My son is in there and he says you

“You brothers and you sisters that

ternally‘, when the burden of 30 million
[blacks] can shoulder their own
weight.” -

Farrakhan has been criticized in the
press because of his statements that
Judaism is a “dirty religion” and that
Hitler was a “great man,” albeit
“wickedly great.” He took time to
clarify the meaning behind these com-
ments, elaborating on why he made
them.

“There is not an intelligent, think-
ing, believing person who believes in
Almighty God, who will condemn a
revealed word that came from On
High, pure to Moses, as ‘dirty’ or ‘gut-
ter.’ When God reveals his truth he
reveals it to bring people up out of the
gutter, up out of the ﬁlth, and to purify

1 their lives and their conduct, ” he said.

He went on to explain how a religion
can be dirty. “Religion is not what you

- preach; i.t-is, what. y9u.. p,r?.9ti9e..1’....hé

 

 

said. “You dirty religion by the way
you practice religion. We disagree with
the practices of Israel. If you show me
where Israel’s practice is righteous-
ness, then I’ll change my mind.

“What I’m saying to Israel is the
Palestinians have a right to their land,”
he said. “I am saying that murder,
deceit and lying is going on to justify
something that never should have been
in the first place.”

Farrakhan explained why he said
Hitler was a great man. .

“I did say that Hitler was a great
man,” he said. “And I’ll say that to-

day. However, ‘great’ does not mean,

‘good.’ ...There was an earthquake in
Mexico.... It was great but it wasn’t
good. ‘Great’, meaning ‘huge, having
far-reaching consequences.’ Hitler was
far-reaching in his evil. His evil af-
fected the whole world. I only made an
observation. ”

Farrakhan also addressed accusations
that he mocked the Holocaust.

“You cannot take my humanity from
me by making me a mocker of the
Holocaust. No blackperson burned any
Jewish person in no oven. I don’t
believe there’s one black person in here

tonight, including myself, who could ‘
— look at a Jewish woman, or a Jewish

man, or a Jewish child being put into

an oven and laugh. I couldn’t do that,”

of the author and not of The Pitt News staff.

Summit
And Beyond

In recent years, U.S.—Soviet relations have been
characterized by marked tension and extreme
distrust. And until recently, there has been a con-
spicuous absence of any contact between high-level
American and Soviet officials and diplomats — a
particularly frightening situation in view of the an-
tagonistic relationship between the superpowers and
the danger of a lack of communication leading to
avoidable misunderstandings and accidental nuclear
war.

But of late, tentative steps have been taken in a
more positive direction. Diplomatic channels are
being repaired, creating the opportunity to put
superpower relations on more solid ground. Indeed,
the approaching summit meeting between Ronald
Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev could serve as an
excellent beginning to increase understanding be-
tween the United States and the Soviet Union.

Yet, for this opportunity to be realized, several
pitfalls must be avoided. First, U.S. ofﬁcials should
not expect rapid progress on an arms control agree-

‘ ment. The diplomatic process will require time and

great effort if it is to build trust and dispel fears.
Patience will be necessary to stave off the frustra-
tions that could damage the relationship.

Second, the American relationship with the Soviet
Union should not be founded solely on arms con-
trol. Diplomatic relations should be pursued within
a broader political context. The past record
demonstrates that when ‘arms negotiations have
ﬂoundered, the political relationship as a whole suf-
fered. This must be prevented in order to provide
stability in U.S.—Soviet relations. If the relationship
is to be firm and reliable, both sides must work not
only to improve understanding on all issues of
political and social concern but must cooperate in
seeking to resolve them as well.

In sum, keeping diplomatic channels open is im-
perative. Where communication is absent we grope
blindly in the dark. That, dear reader, is extreme-
ly dangerous.

Missed Story

On Friday, Nov. 8, Dr. Linus Paul-
ing, two-time winner of the Nobel
Prize, one for chemistry and the other
for peace, spoke at the University of
Pittsburgh in Benedum Auditorium.

It is not often that one man receives
two Nobels in his lifetime. It is less
likely that such a man should visit Pitt.

That The Pitt News failed to print a
word about Pauling’s speech in the
Nov. 11 and 13 editions is, I think, a
tragedy.

That you did not see ﬁt to share with
your readers Pauling’s thoughts on the
Strategic Defense Initiative —. that its
primary purpose is to place such a great
ﬁnancial strain on the Soviet economy
that the Soviet government will col-
lapse, and his thoughts on the prospect
of world peace-— is a disservice to the
university community. .

A Additionally, you printed “a candid
discussion” between the Washington
Editor of the Reader ’s Digest, William
Shulz and President Reagan in the Nov.
11 edition of The Pitt News. Was this
a candid and “condensed” article? Did
President Reagan get to edit his com-
ments before publication? If you had
covered Pauling’s speech you would
know why I ask those questions.

Is the community better served by
publishing syndicated reports from na-
tional services or by covering and
publishing reports on local, university-
related activities?

Yours is an honorable profession; set
your standards high.

Farrakhan Debate

I’d like to respond to a letter by a
fellow named Jon A. Hoppe. I don’t
think it necessary to bring into it my
opinions on the matters discussed in his
letter, although that too is tempting.
Rather, I'll keep my criticism conﬁned
to a purely technical point.

I’m talking about the third paragraph
in which Hoppe says that this fellow
named Lyndon Kirkland is a hypocrite
because he claims to be unbiased and
open-minded while supporting a speech
at the university by Louis Farrakhan.
I don’t think Jon realized the problem
with that statement, let alone his own
hypocrisy in making it. I’d like only to
point out that this statement is simply
incorrect and that it reﬂects twisted
definitions of bias and objectivity.
Kirkland is unbiased precisely because
he supports a speech by a highly biased
speaker. That is very clearly a fact.

Letters to the Editor

If Jon A. Hoppe. School of Law,
’87, wants to hear Tom Bradley, Bar-
bara Jordan and Carl Rowan, he should
invite them. But he cannot determine
who black people want to hear. There
are in fact four rights to be protected
here: 1) the right of Louis Farrakhan
to speak; 2) the right of those who want
to hear him speak; 3) the right of those
who want to protest his speaking; and
4) the right of those who do not want
to hear him speak. These rights are
protected by the U.S. Constitution and
not by Mr. Hoppe’s desires, biases or
morals.

I have not heard Farrakhan say most
of the things reported in several dif-
ferent ways by many newspapers,
magazines and electronic media. This
does not mean that he did not say them.
But it may mean that he did not say
them the way they are reported. I sim-
ply do not know. Unlike Mr. Hoppe,
I do not believe everything that I read,.
see on television or hear on the radio
since I know that editorial license and
biased reporting often distort the truth
in order to make a proﬁt.

Furthermore, Hoppe should question
exactly why so many black people want
to hear Farrakhan in spite of the allega-
tions of anti—Semitism so frequently
made. Surely, the masses of blacks are
not interested in his views about Jews,
when unemployment, poor education
and poverty stalk the black family so
persistently. More likely they want to
know whether or not this man can help
them survive the hostility of white
America. Those who are opposed to af-
ﬁrmative action, open admissions, in-

q creased domestic programs to fight

poverty and improved educational cur-
ricula for black Americans have
created the need for Farrakhan.

Barbara S. Sizemore,

Acting Chairman

Dept. of Black Community
Education Research and Development

There is a need for strong black
leadership here. Last week, no blacks
were elected to the city council. Mar-
tin Luther King was a great leader, by
strength of convictions, strength of
mind and courage. We need someone
to voice the anger, to speak out against
the injustice and prejudice that go on
to this day. But the [members of] Na-
tion of Islam- are kooks! His group
boycotted Martin Luther King’s “I
have a dream" address in Washington.
And believe me, the Rev. King never
got a $5 million interest-free loan from
Moammar'Qaddafy. It matters nothing
that he gets big crowds in New York
or L.A., or that he can get people to
follow him.

Haven’t you ever seen pictures of

. Hitler getting huge crowds worked up
into a frenzy of mindless hatred against
Jews and mindless love for the German

state? The neo—Nazis and the Moral
Majority get big turnouts wherever
they go. Racism, nationalism and
militarism get these religious Charlatans
the followings, and that leads to more
political weight, more power and more
money. Don’t go see him. Nothing
could say more than to let his little talk
fizzle by quietly and emptily up in the
[Fitzgerald] Field House. He’s a loser,
just like Jerry Falwell or Thomas Metz—

John G. Picone
CAS ’86

The hiring of Louis Farrakhan to
speak at this university has brought Pitt
to a new low point. That is not to say
that he has no right to speak his mind,
no matter how vile the rubbish that
comes out. However, the university has
no right taking my money and using it
to pay Mr. Farrakhan’s salary — a man
who proclaims that I, my family and

, many of my friends are innately wick-

ed and practice a gutter religion.
Claims have been made that Mr.
Farrakhan represents a positive image
for the black community. What, may
I ask, is so positive about a man who
must slander another minority just to
make his point of view heard? Hitler
used that same kind of anti-Semitic
slander in attempts to enhance the self-
image of the German people. The
resultant war and holocaust constituted
mankind’s greatest tragedy. Yet, in the
Reverend’s eye, the Fuhrer was a
“very great man.” If his view is a
positive image for the black communi-
ty, then they are surely on the road to
disaster. However, I am conﬁdent that
black Americans are wiser than that.
Claims have been made that criticism
of Farrakhan amounts to nothing more
than whites trying to put down a power-
ful black leader. I would like to know
who in the heck cared who this man
was before his slanderous remarks
became public knowledge. In fact,
almost nobody did. Thus, the notion
that he was a powerful black leader is
absurd. Furthermore, much (but cer-
tainly not all) criticism of the man has
come from Jews, yet voting records
and polls‘ clearly indicate that Jewish
Americans have been among the most
pro-civil rights of all ethnic groups in
the United States. A decent number of
Jews marched for these causes in the
’60s and continue to do so against apar-
theid. However, manylof them feel
betrayed by those who would legitimize
Farrakhan and what he represents.

For_I7:ze Dissent/ Marc Chandler
 The High—Tech Fallacy; Wrong Medicine For Ailing Economy

_ Page 5,g,2g

From the Sun Belt to the Rust Belt,
communities are embracing high-tech
industries as a panacea for many
economic woes. It is widely believed
that these new industries will replace
the now obsolete smokestack industries
as the engine of economic growth and
development. Precisely what comprises
these high-tech industries remains am-
biguous. A general survey would sug-
gest that high~tech industries are not a
homogeneous lot. Many of the so-
called high-tech industries are actual-
ly industries and parts of other in-

,;‘*_, udustries that have been around for a

decade or more. There is little reason
to believe that the high-tech industries
will escape the fate of other mature in-
dustries, including redundant invest-
ment, excess capacity and
unemployment.

Growth rates during the last decade

in industries, in which the percentage
of R&D expenditures or the number of
scientists, engineers and technical
employees is two times the national
average for all industries, did not
markedly differ from the employment
growth in overall manufacturing of 4.2
percent and unfavorably compares with
the growth in total employment of 27.6
percent.

As in the economy as a whole, com-
petition in these industries occurs by
reducing production costs rather than
prices. Consequently, assembly jobs in
high-tech industries are subject to com-
petition from low wage labor, par-
ticularly from countries such as
Malaysia, Taiwan, the Philippines and
Mexico where assembly workers earn
as little as 50 cents an hour. Intel, Na-
tional Semiconductor, Atari, Apple and

Wang Labs have already moved jobs
to the Far East. ,

The computer has become equated
with modernity and has emerged as the
very symbol of high-tech industries.
Contrary to common expectations, the
computer industry is plagued with a
litany of problems including slower
growth, layoffs and collapsing stock
prices. In 1985, U.S. customers will
pay some $44 billion for seven million
computers of all kinds. This is
equivalent to a 17 percent increase in
dollar sales and a seven percent in-
crease in unit sales over 1984. Yet after
three years of 25 percent these figures
are anemic. _

Slowing growth reﬂects ,a glut of
suppliers and products as much as
slackening demand. For example,
worldwide there are 35 manufacturers
ofﬂoppy disk drives. The capacity of

the top four alone is sufficient to more
than satisfy world demand. Similarly,
Japanese makers of low cost printers
have cut their production to offset what
they consider a surfeit of inventory in
the United States.

The ‘period between 1981 and 1984
was a sellers market. Demand appeared
insatiable. Sales of personal computers
—’most of them going to business —
quadrupled. Demand has fallen as
overall capital spending has been
reduced. Because the total computer in-
dustry output is less than two percent
of the GNP and employs less than one
percent of the work force, the slump
has been effectively concealed by ag-
gregate statistics. But the computer in-
dustry has lost more than 18,000 jobs
since employment peaked in August
1984'. Supplier industries have been hit
even harder. Sales by semiconductor

companies which supply integrated cir-
cuits to computer makers have shrunk
by an estimated 25 percent this year, .
resulting in the laying off of 10 percent‘
of their 200,000-strong U.S. work
force.

Our penchant for technological
quick-ﬁxes prevents us from address-
ing the underlying problems that arise
from the anarchistic and therefore in-
efficient marketplace. Increasing the
level, pace and dispersion of
technology is no substitute for rational,
efficient and socially responsible
economic development. It would in-
deed be a tragedy if communities
across the country attracted high-tech
industries with tax incentives and sub-
sidies only to discover that they, too,
have fallen prey to the same market-
forces responsible for the current social
and economic dislocation.

Coping With Student Apathy Through Indifferent Means 2

Student apathy. What a hideous
phrase. In recent months, it has become
a favorite part of this university’s
vocabulary — especially by those on
the Student Government Board. It’s

' been very helpful in explaining low
voter turnout or lack of enthusiasm at
school-sponsored events.

For example, why were there more
umbrellas and raincoats than there were
students at the Pitt-Syracuse “rain
game” several Saturdays ago? Surely
not because of the weather. As I recall,
it was a perfect day for a game. And
certainly the game was a feature attrac-
tion. The Panthers were coming off an
exciting 21-7 loss to superpower Navy.
And Syracuse, well, a team that wears
mosphorescent helmets and calls itself

the “Orangemen” surely speaks for
itself. So, why weren’t more students
at the football game? They must be
apathetic.

OK, granted the Pitt-Syracuse foot-
ball game wasn’t the best draw in town.
The absence of the student population

, is understandable. But what about the

elections last week? Huh? What about
that? There were only 2,321 votes cast
for the highly important ofﬁce of SGB
president. Last year, approximately
2,400 students voted. Why the sudden,
dramatic drop-off? It wasn’t because
the election lacked excitement. It had
all the makings of a big-time election.
There were allegations and-counter-
allegations. Why, there even was a

hearing involving campaign violations.
The candidate who was on trial was ac-
quitted, of course, but still —

So, where were you 100-odd
students? Yes, I’m talking to you. You
know exactly who you are. There are
ways to find out if you voted or not,
you know, so there is no use hiding.

Each person who voted received a
sticker that read, “I Voted in the SGB
Elections.” I have one taped onto my
cubicle wall and I didn’t even vote. It
would be a very simple process to go
into the dorms and ﬁnd 100 people who
don’t have stickers. So confess. You’re
as good as caught.

The question arises, then, of what to
do with these 100-odd offenders. Cer-

tainly the punishment. should be made
to ﬁt the crime. Maybe those offenders
should be made to run for office
themselves. Maybe they should be
made to spend countless pennies and
countless minutes posting and running
off posters that are going to be scrib-
bled on anyway. Maybe they should be
made to stand up before a dozen or so
people and debate the issues.

Then, when only one-tenth of the
university student population turns up
to vote in their election, maybe they
will understand. Nah, too lenient. The
punishment should be something that
hits closer to students’ hearts.

Maybe, then, they should be ordered
to throw a party. Yeah, a party. They

should have to go out and buy a half
dozen kegs, spend days preparing food
and setting up tables and watch as no
one shows up, And the ones that do
come either complain because the beer
is the wrong brand or leave early
because they think the party is boring
and a waste of time. Maybe that would
make them understand.

So, I hope I have cleared up that lit-
tle matter of student apathy. Perhaps
this column will help lessen this terri-
ble, heinous crime. Maybe some of you
apathetiacs will now decide to reform.
Nah! It probably won’t do any good.
You apathetiacs were probably so
apathetic toward this column that you
never got this far in the ﬁrst place.

‘ City

By Karen Pennewill
For The Pitt News

Last night, campus police and city
police were out in full force during the
Louis Farrakhan speech at the Fitz-
gerald Field House.

The campus police took steps to
make sure their security was visible and
effective. The Field House was cleared
of all activities at approximately 2 p.m.
yesterday. According to Walt Waters ,
assistant director of field operations for
Pitt’s public safety department, a sweep
(general search) of the Field House was
then done and most doors were locked
electronically. The doors which re-
mained unlocked were manned by
police officers to make sure security
was maintained, said Waters.

Two sweeps of the Field House were
done, one at 2 p.m. and another at 6
p.m. “There were a few offices that

 

were still working when the 2:00 sweep
was made,” said Waters . “So a quick,
double sweep was done to be on the
safe side, particularly the areas they
weren’t able to get earlier.”

The campus police used the city's
Special Operation Division (SOD) dur-
ing their sweeps. They also used the
county canine unit. The sweep involved
searching the building for any ex-
plosives or other dangerous devices
which could threaten Farrakhan’s life.

“During the speech, the university
police had a large contingent of ofﬁcers
on the inside of the Field House. The
city had a large contingent of officers
on the outside around Alequippa
Street,” said Waters . “Everyone who
came to the speech had to have tickets.
No tickets were sold at the Field
House.”

Waters added that everyone who
came into the Field House had to go
through a metal detector. There were

three metal detectors located just inside
the doors. “Everybody, and I mean
everybody,had to go through there,”
said Waters .

The campus police had hoped to
discourage anyone from bringing any
packages or briefcases to the speech.
If a person insisted on bringing in his
packages, they were searched, said
Waters .

The campus police had their normal
amount of manpower. 15 officers,

. covering their usual rounds and areas.

In addition, Waters said, there were
close to 20 campus police officers in
the Field House. The only officers not
working last night were those on vaca-
tion, Waters added. The usual number
of guards was increased, from seven
guards to 12. There were also four
detectives working, he said.

Thirty or more ofﬁcers from the city
police maintained security on the out-
side of the Field House. Waters said

Posvar seeks further improvements

By Joe Krzywiecki
Staff Writer

The University Senate, in its first
meeting of the 1985-86 activity year,
discussed ways that Pitt could improve.

A report read by President Wesley
Posvar stated that a planning process
is needed if Pitt is to maintain its com-
petitive edge with other universities in
the Pittsburgh area.

“An ongoing planning process is
unusual for a large university,” Posvar
said. “It is difficult because our prod-
uct is an intangible one.” Posvar also
said that although there is no sharp
market mechanism or bottom line that
forces decisions, having priorities can
make planning work.

Posvar’s report also stated that Pitt

achievement. “The University of Pitts-
burgh is taking a lead in enforcing
academic standards for intercollegiate
sports,” he said. “Student athletes are
now enrolled in bonaﬁde programs so
that they can graduate with real
degrees.”

With the creation of an honors col-
lege and the acquisition of the Harrnar-
ville Research Center from Chevron,
Posvar said the university can be a vital
asset to the growth of the area and an
asset to the image of western Penn-
sylvania as being" one of the most
livable areas in the United States.

Posvar also emphasized that the
university’s enrollment is up by three
percent despite a decrease in high
school graduates. And academic ex-
cellence, Posvar said, makes a good
business investment.

The report also stated that institu-
tional cooperation between Pittsburgh
schools and other colleges in the Pitts-

burgh area could be a benefit to the
university. “The quality of education
in Pittsburgh schools, I expect, will im-
prove,” said Posvar.

“I propose to reach into the life of
minority high school students,” Posvar
continued, speaking about affirmative
action. “I would like them to take the
hard math and language courses so they
can become the doctors and lawyers
and the people that they want to be.”
Posvar added that chairmen, deans and
directors of personnel “must get the
job done” if the affirmative action pro-
gram is to work.

Technology will become another ma-
jor tool for students to use at the univer-
sity, Posvar said. The completion of a
new computer system to be installed at
the Hillman Library will make the card
indexing system obsolete. Posvar said
the computing system can accom-
modate computers of all types and
modes.

that the city police force assigned of-
ﬁcers from all over the city specifical-
ly for this event.

“Security was even tighter and of-
ficers were more alert last night, ” said
Inspector William Ward of station No.
4 in Oakland. He provided as many
men as possible to the area around the
Field House. “Most of the men were

from station [No.] 1 of downtown Pitts-'

burgh,” added Ward. _

“The Black Action Society furnished
some of the ushers for the event, ” said
Waters . “There were also ushers on
the outside — hoping to form orderly
lines.” The area in which people
entered the Field House was arranged
for three lines of people to go in. “The
ushers lined the people into equal lines
and tried to get people in as quickly as
possible,” Waters said.

The University of Pittsburgh has
never had metal detectors before for a
speaker. Waters admitted that this is
the first time they had to rent metal
detectors. “We haven’t had one this
controversial,” said Waters. “We on-
ly had a few threats against him. Most
of them have come from the JDO —

New York.” Waters said that an
estimated 2-3 threats have been made
against Farrakhan.

The campus police talked to law en-

forcement agencies in New York anéfr

got some pointers from them. New
York police dealt with security in-
creases when Farrakhan spoke at
Madison Square Garden. New York
police also had to deal more intensely
with the JDO because their head-
quarters are in New York.

“The law enforcement officers there
seem to think that having a large con-
tingent of police is what kept
everything orderly,” said Waters.

Farrakhan was told by campus police
that his bodyguards would not be
allowed to have weapons in the Field‘
House. “When they were told their"
weapons would not be in there, we had
no problems from them,” said Waters .
“Also, they claim they don’t carry
weapons.”

Despite the efforts of campus police

By Michael Fay

At 23, Emilio Estevez’s career in film
is progressing at a rate that can only
be described as rapid.

As he walked into the 34th-floor suite
of the uptown Manhattan hotel where
a small group of journalists and l were
waiting, he reminded me of that guy in
everyone’s high school graduating
class who somehow manages to get
through Harvard Law School before
you can get through your junior year.
He’s very pleasant and exudes the
confidence and nervous energy of an
over-achiever. His hair is closely
cropped, there’sa small ring in his left

ear, and_he’s wearing a light brown

 

sport jacket, blue jeans and white
leather high-top basketball shoes. He
looks every bit the teen film idol.

Since his graduation from high
school in 1980, Estevez has starred in
four television dramas and seven
feature films. Although he co-starred
with his father Martin Sheen in one of
his earliest efforts — a TV drama en-
titled ‘‘In the Custody of Strangers” —
Estevez stressed that he has always
been independent. At one point, said
Estevez, agents even urged him to
take his father's stage name, but that
was out of the question. Estevez is in
this business for the long run. He
wants to be taken seriously.

That Was Then This Is Now marks

‘,4. ./2 ..

a turning point in his career. While it
is the third S.E. Hinton film adaptation
in which he has co-starred in addition
to Tex and The Outsiders, it is also his
first attempt at writing a screenplay.

Having read the’ book That Was
Then  This Is Now while shooting
Tex, he was inspired and saw it as an
opportunity to expand his horizons.
Despite his lack of experience with
screenwriting, his persistence and en-
thusiasm for the work enabled him to
option it from Hinton.

“She was a little reluctant because
of my age,” he recalled, “but I talked
with her about some of my ideas, and

.she finally just said, ‘Go with it.’ ”

He had put one screenplay together

 

before but said, ‘‘It was terrible. But at
least I knew how to put one together.
I'd been reading scripts all my life. So
for me, it was just a matter of sitting
down and doing the work.” '

Work is a thing that drives this young
actor. He shifts slowly up and back in
his chair as we talk. He talks with
relentless enthusiasm for his latest
release.

“Well, I read the book when the
market was flooded with material teen
films that were really the sexploitatjon-
type films, which portray kids as all in-
to sex, drugs and rock ‘n’roll, and I

  He ’s not Beethoven,

I am writing in response to
George Kresak’s review of Kurt
Vonnegut’s new novel, Galapa-
gos.

I have two points that I would
like to make. The first is that I
would like to thank George for
loaning his copy of the book to
me. Secondly, I would like to
disagree with George’s ex-
cessively negative critique of the
book.

Galapagos is no Cat’s Cradle
or S/aughter-House Five. it’s
probably not even the equivalent
of one of Vonnegut’s lesser
novels, such as Mother Night. it’s
no secret that Kurt Vonnegut, at
63, is not the highly original writer
that he once was. But that is not
to say that Galapagos is entirely
devoid of redeeming features, as
George’s review would lead one
to believe.

While the plot line of Galapa-
gos may not‘ be the most original,

problems and contradictions of
contemporary society and

human nature.
In Galapagos, he touches

upon such topics as scientific
and managerial irresponsibility,
greed, unearned privilege, en-
trancement with celebrity, the in-
ability to make hard decisions
and their effects: global
economic crisis, starvation, acid
rain and war, among others. All
are given the typical Vonnegut
treatment, which is to say that
they are addressed in a
humorous but tragically human
fashion. This alone makes
reading the book a worthwhile
experience, ‘and I hope that Von-
negut’s concern isn’t quite as
prehistoric as George suggests.
While Vonnegut will never
-write Beethoven’s Ninth Sym-
phony (a joke from the book, in-
cidentally), he has made many
valuable contributions to
literature and our society,
Galapagos being among them.

MAZE
By Christopher Manson
Holt, Rinehart and Winston

By Bonnie McElhinny

This is not a book review — Maze is
not a book. It is, as the first page quick-
Iy tells us, “a building in the shape of
a book.

“Each numbered page depicts a
room in the Maze. The doors in each
room lead to other rooms. For exam-
ple, the room on page one has doors
leading to rooms 20, 26, 41 and 21. To
go through door No. 20, simply turn
page 20.” V

The object is to get from room one
to room 45 by moving along the
shortest possible path, which we are
told is 16 pages. Each page has its

black-and-white drawing of a room with
several numbered doors leading out of
it. Forty-five rooms take the
readerlmaze-wanderer through dark

each of these rooms are guidelines
given to us by a cryptic, supercilious
guide who calls himself Cereberus.

Finding the 16-room path is only the ’

 
 

cellar rooms, baroque drawing rooms,
bedrooms draped in sheets, trellised

‘ courtyards, nurseries, hallways with

endless mirrors and, sometimes,
darkened rooms with no exit. Opposite

W¢\\5:\

 

first step, though. There is a riddle hid-
den in room 45, a room which has scat-
tered objects and anagrams mixed
together to form a nearly insoluble
rebus. After deciphering the riddle, one

 

need only trace one’s path back to 
well, treasure, of course. Maze is yet
another one of the flurry of books,
starting with Masquerade, which have
been published lately that offer readers
the thrill of a mystery, a challenge to
their wits, some valuable metal or gem
or, failing all else, money — Maze’s
case, $10,000, which is approximate-
ly three terms at Pitt (in-state tuition),
2,500 Capri pizzas, 200 dinners at the
Top of the Triangle," 26,666 beers at
Hemingway's during Friday Happy
Hour or almost 5,000 large containers
of O-fries.

The book/maze/building costs

$5.95. Of course, I do not have to warn «

you that it’s not easy. Anything’s a
clue, nothing and no one is trustwor-
thy, even Cereberus has been known
to get lost. And he awaits you.

O A-.Sih.0.wcase. .._Ncvember...1.5...1.9.85

By Michael Fay ‘

Mark Jennings (Emilio Estevez) and
Bryon Douglas (Craig Sheffer) have
always been the best of friends. Since
the death of Mark’s parents, he’s lived
like a brother with Bryon and his
mother (Barbara "Babcock).

After years of joyriding and
prankstering, the boys are split. You
guessed it: Bryon falls in love with
Cathy (Kim Delaney). As their romance
buds Bryon is pulled farther and farther
away from his “brother.” The plot is
cliched, yes, but it’s a classic
nonetheless, and it’s the plot of That
was Then This is Now, the fourth in
a succession of S.E. Hinton novels
adapted to the silver screen.

The screenplay, by the way, is the
rookie effort of co-star Estevez. It also

happens to be the film’s one in-
escapable flaw. Instead of developing
and narrowing in on the basic conflict
of the movie — The Mark-Bryon-Cathy

triangle — Estevez saw fit to tack on "

a myriad of minor conflicts which finally
render the plot tangled, unfocused and
unresolvable.

The film, though, is generally well
done; there are a couple of good per-
formances (Mark and Mrs. Douglas),
the script was updated, there was
some interesting camera work, and
humor was, at times, successfully in-
jected into the script. However, the
lack of development and resolution
overshadows any of these positive
points. -

What starts out as a legitimate and
compelling story grows into an in-

M minor conflicts make a minor movie“

coherent mess. Extraneous conflicts
abound. Adding to the confusion is
Bryon’s ex-girlfriend, his ex-girIfriend’s
punk-rock brother, the two boys’ men-
tor/bar-owner friend, Cathy's suicidal
little brother and illegal drugs, and I’m
sure I've forgotten a dozen others.
All this confusion would be OK if the
movie were three days long, and the

author was Leo Tolstoy. But it’s not,‘-

and he isn’t. Instead of being neatly
resolved at the end, That Was Then
has an ending that is so trite and so
flippant that I still haven't accepted it.
While Estevez may learn from That
Was Then  and go on to do great
things, the movie itself, in all its
schizophrenic glory, is bound only for
obscurity. No, I don’t even think the
kids will buy this one. .

Once Bitten, you will laugh, but soon forge

By Lori Faiella

Once Bitten is obviously missing a
few bites. The movie will draw a few
laughs, but basically it is just plain
stupid. Then again, stupidity can have
its advantages — take Jerry Lewis, for
example.

Like the Porky’s-type flicks, Once
Bitten is full of adolescents whose un-
coordinated, foolish attempts at pair-
ing up prevent them from “going all
the way.” The difference in Once Bit-
ten is that these silly, inexperienced
teen-agers are accompanied by the

‘Countess (Lauren Hutton) -- an exotic -

vampiress who searches for young,
male virgins.'She needs their young,
innocent blood in order to maintain her
youth.— she is slightly over 400 years

  
   
  
  
 
    
  
    
      

       
   

once SLICK: uncuev moms

old.

Like Love at First Bite, a hilarious
vampire movie starring George
Hamilton as the manipulative, off-the-
wall vampire, Once Bitten takes a
humorous approach to vampire lore.
Here the roles are reversed; we have
a female vampire doing the seducing.
Love at First Bite, however, had a bet-
ter storyline and ending than Once
Bitten.

In Once Bitten, Mark Kendall, while
in search of an exciting evening, gets
more then he bargained for. He and
two of his corny buddies go to wild
Hollywood to look for interesting
females. Sitting in an “anything goes”
type of club, Kendall receives a phone
call at his table (the tables were each
adorned with red, heart-shaped

telephones). The call is from a lady

who calls herself the Countess. Ken-
dall of course can’t believe that an
older, beautiful lady clad in black
wants to meet him, a high-school stu-
dent out looking for the good time he

can’t get from his girlfriend. Little does .

Kendall realize that there’s a catch. If

she can bite him three times on his in-

ner thigh, he is hers for eternity.
After their first night together (or

rather their first bite), Kendall begins
to do strange things. He acts so stupid
you almost have to laugh. His change
in behavior comes as a shock to
everyone he knows, especially his
girlfriend, who is upset by his involve-
ment with this “strange” lady. He
begins to wear nothing but black, goes
from eating well-done burgers to raw
ones, is found napping in a trunk and
even drinks blood.

The stupidity of the film really shines
at the school’s Halloween dance
where the Countess and Kendall’s
girlfriend have a dance-off to win him
over — the good, pure and innocent
battling evil. After 10 minutes of swing-
ing, twirling and (of course). shoving,
the innocent girlfriend wins. At this
point, she realizes what is happening,
and the campaign to save him from a
future as a vampire begins.

It never gets any better. Kendall’s
girlfriend is kidnapped and taken to the
Countess’ mansion in a white limo with
a license plate reading “LYF SUX.”
Kendall and his two feeble-minded
friends try to rescue her and meet up
with the Countess herself and her
harem‘ of vampires, virgins she ab-
ducted over the centuries, each wear-

ing the costume of his century. They
await Kendall’s arrival — it is time for
his third bite, and they are all there to
witness it. After a 20-minute vampire
vs. mortal chase, Kendall and his
girlfriend ruin the Countess’ plans by
“doing it” in an empty coffin, and the

_ Countess’ age catches up to her.

The movie starts out hilariously, and
even some of the silly parts are funny,
but it leaves you with the ‘‘I can’t
believe I went to see this” feeling.
Young audiences might find it enter-

. taining, which the PG rating suggests,

but for Lauren Hutton fans, it will be a

e _ severe disappointment. She plays the

part okay, but she deserves a better
role. It is an insult to her reputation and
ability. ‘

The rest of the acting is fairly good.
Jim Carrey as Mark Kendall is funny
and amusing. His girlfriend, who
demonstrates her dancing abilities, is
a little prissy and demanding but it fits
the role. Then there is the Countess’
eccentric butler played by Cleavon Lit-
tle. He is really off-the-wall, but he’s
entertaining.

_ Once Bitten is being shown as a
sneak preview at several theaters. If
you miss it, don’t worry.

By George Kresak
Have you an unconquerable desire
to pry into the personal lives of others?
Are you aroused by gossip, scandal
and intrigue? is there nothing you find
more gratifying than smearing the good
reputation of your fellow? If so, then, by

all means, read on:

According to a rotund yet unwed
mother, the Prince and Princessof
Wales were seen last Monday “living
it up” at Pittsburgh’s fashionable
nightspot the Upstage. A reliable
source reported that, after dancing

 alone for nearly 20 minutes, the

jocular, rosy-cheeked Prince officially
declared war on his youngest son.
Princess Diana, more than a little
miffed, secretly plotted her husband’s
overthrow as she forced her attentions
on a sheepish, homosexual lad of 19.

God sav Queen!

A portly elementary-school teacher
confided that Brooke Shields and John
Mellencamp have been dating on the
sly. A second source said, ‘‘I saw ‘em
just t’other day at the Tastee Freeze
in Smalltown, USA. They was sittin’ in
his Chevy, munchin’ on chili dogs and
discussin’ Byronic imagery and the
blessin’s of foreplay.” When Brooke’s
mother was informed of her daughter’s
steamy affair, she was horrified and
demanded that President Reagan im-
mediately declare full nuclear alert.

Noted hedonist Mick Jagger is said
to have sacrificed his life of sin and
self-indulgence in order to assume a
leadership role in the Moral Majority.
In an interview, a delighted Jerry
Falwell wiped the knockwurst from his
chin and said, “This is an exciting day
for my ministry. With the added

revenue that Mick’s sure to generate, .

we plan on buying the U.S. Supreme

Cu PSTAG E

ife in highfalutin ﬁshbowl

Court.” Unavailable for comment,
Mick was said to be in the midst of con-
ceiving his 35th illegitimate child.

Whew!

In her recently published book,
Priscilla Presley confesses, “l never
loved Elvis. He was vermin. He was
cruel, selfish and vulgar. With the ex-
ception of the first time we made love,
he forever denied me the pickled her-
ring I so adore.” Asked why she mar-
ried Elvis, Priscilla replied, “Jack Ken-
nedy was dead, and the weather was
promising.”

Oh!

it was reported that Chairman Lee
lacocca embarrassed the Chrysler
Corporation at a recent gala dinner
party given by notorious socialite Claus
von Bulow. Sources say that lacocca
was seen jamming three kinds of
caviar up his nostrils after which he
conceitedly lifted both hands high in

5‘ in}: iiieesgw

 

the air to be marveled at by the
assembled throng, proclaiming them,
“as shapely and elegant as a
woman’s.” The bubbly executive later
demured, saying, “l’m not feminine in
the least. I’m as macho as Ted Kop-
pel, and l’ve got the clothespins on my
nipples to prove it.”

Novelist Kurt Vonnegut was recent-
ly spotted on campus furtively mobiliz-
ing disenfranchised electrical
engineers and corpulent bank
managers. It is rumored that they are
planning a clandestine armed invasion
of the Galapagos Islands for the pur-
pose of speeding up the evolutionary
process by mating with fur seals and
sea cows.

Good luck!

None of what you have just read is

even remotely true. If it's the truth you
seek, then study philosophy — or, bet-
ter yet, buy People magazine.

By Stephen Morrison

Well, you know you're a star when
college radio DJs start in with on-the-
air character assassinations. It's good
free publicity, at any rate. Anyway,
looking over last week’s installment, I
think I was unduly harsh in some
places (you should have seen what
was edited), so this week /’ll try to make
amends by being, with one exception,
nice. Deep down, you know, I’m a nice
guy. Really.

A—ha: Train Of Thought

I What a shrewd band. For one thing,
I have never heard anyone make bet-
ter use of an ordinary two-octave voice
than their vocalist Morten Harket, and
for another, it’s astounding that they
could rehash and repackage the
dubious genre of “Eurodisco” and ac-
tually sell it. The most amazing thing
of all, though, is that it works. “Train
of Thought” is exciting, propulsive and
lovely to dance to, and it reveals a sim-
ple, natural feel for great hooks. You
can’t pronounce their names, but A-ha
have a solid musical sensibility that
comes through in any language.

(I realize I cut down “Take On Me”
two months ago, but it’s my
prerogative to be an inconsistent
hypocrite.)

B-plus
Roger Daltry: After The Fire

It comes as no surprise to learn that
“After the Fire” was written by Pete
Townshend. Nearly every aspect of the
song bears his distinctive stamp — the
lilting melody, the graceful transitions,
but most of all the inimitable lyric
zingers like l’ve got to stop thinking/
l’ve got to stop drinking/ l’ve got to stop

Daltry gives a fine performance, his
voice strong and confident. There are,
of course, no especially challenging
high notes here, but Daltry is wise not
to try for them any longer. What his
singing has lost in stunning acrobatic
virtuosity, it has gained’ in character.

This may not be the greatest thing
ever to hit the airwaves, and it may not
even be on par with The Who’s better
material, but it sure ain’t bad.

Echo and the Bunny-men: Bring On The
Dancing Horses

Don’t go to the trouble of trying to
figure out what this ditty is “about.” As
in all of this band’s songs, the lyrics
sound suspiciously like they might be
what they appear to be: incoherent
fragments of drug-induced psychedelic
“poetry.” But like I said, don’t worry
about it. Just close your eyes, kick
back and enjoy because this stuff is
gorgeous.

Evidently the band is happy with the
sound they coined on Ocean Rain
because “Horses” has the same lush,
orchestral feel as that Ip, as well as the
same sense of grandtragedy. For all
their pretension and pomposity — they
have publicly stated that they consider
themselves to be the best band in the
world — Echo and the Bunnymen re-
main a compelling musical force. (I’m
sure that they’ll love this record at
CMU, but that’s just something I’ll
have to live with.)

The Eurythmics with Aretha Franklin:
Sisters Are Doing It For Themselves

Just as anyone who criticizes Israel
for any reason is accused of anti-
Semitism, I have no doubt that I will be

called a sexist for denouncing this

song. If I were worried, however, about
what people thought of me, I would not
write this column. “Sisters” is chock-

full of good intentions but has nothing '

interesting musically (remember
“music?”) to offer, nor has it any sort
of underlying intelligence to give it
dignity. It’s just an activist rant that
could have been written in 1967. Also,
there is an undercurrent of nastiness
that suggests that the real message is
“Sisters Want to Own the World.”
Well, let them have it, I say. lsure don’t
want it.

Hector in Paris: Party on the Edge

Rock-n-roll meets R&B meets elec-
tronic quirkiness, and the end result is
a fairly charming little tune about,
presumably, mankind’s irreverent at-
titude in the face on the apocalypse.
They must have posted a sign with the
word “zippy” on the wall of the studio
and concentrated hard, because this
song embodies that word. I like the sax
riffs, too. A catchy 45 from yet another
promising local band. Info: Mom’s

Madonna: Dress You Up

Somehow, the fact that Madonna is
nothing more than a talentless bimboid
cashing in on her sex appeal
(something any enterprising young
lady can conceivably do —— it’s the
oldest profession, in fact) has never
prevented me from liking her music.

I don’t know — maybe I’m deprav-
ed enough that I actually allow myself
to be manipulated by her
Machiavellian media schemes. More
likely it’s just that she records catchy
songs. Not all of her attempts at classic
Top 10 singles pan out, but most —
such as this one — do. Hey, I don’t like
the idea any more than you, but as
long as Madonna continues to crank

‘out such irresistible little pieces of

cream pie, we’ll have to continue
taking her seriously.

It is now almost at year since Band

1985 is the “Year OfThelnternationaI”

By Matthew Yokobosky

On Nov. 8, a most befitting and
monumental celebration began. The
1985 Carnegie International opened,
heralding Andrew Carnegie’s ses-
quicentennial with works by 42 con-
temporary artists from America and
Europe, including Richard Serra,
Robert Longo, Francesco Clemente
and Sigmar Polke. In addition, for the
first time since Carnegie’s initial exhibi-

).

tion in 1896, the Carnegie Prize was ’

 awarded for works which conveyed ex-

.ce|lence in the advancement of artistic
style.

Welcomed by Serra’s weathered
steel sculpture entitled “Car-
negie”(1985), the museum members
were abuzz with compliments sur-
rounding the diversity of the show.
Aside from the usual amount of oil
paintings, mediums as diverse as
sound, crayon, LED, durotran, neon
and spruce roots were utilized to
create an atmosphere of complimen-
tary contrast. For example, works of
sound were positioned by signs of
LED, and neo-expressionistic paint-
ings were played off by cool, dreary
photo-coIIage.___ ___

Upon entering the—Sarah Scaife
gallery, the noise of Chainsaws swelled
in the room from Jonathan Borofsky’s
“Sounds of the World — Radar”
(1985). Using sound and mixed media,

as it watched a painted wall filled with
columns of audio-descriptive words.
Patrons stood and listened as the
“person” conveyed the sound of the
world, which included “mastodon in tar
pit” and “wheel of fortune.” Borofsky
seemed to capitalize on the theory that
sound never fades but continually
bounces throughout the atmosphere,
making his work a delightful diversion
from the more melodramatic pieces.
Adjacent were Jenny HoIzer’s con-
tinuing series of electronic moving
message units. While unquestionably
a controversial recognition as art,
these works are selections from her
“Truisms” (1983-84), “Survival”
(1983) and “Living” (1985) series,
which read like minimalistic poetry.
How has it become that poetry can be
recognized as visual art? 0
In the same vein, Bruce Neuman’s
spiral neon sculpture “Having
Fun/Good Life/Symptoms” (1985) was
aswirl of phrases like “back and forth,
up and down, round and round,”
which read like a 1940 cinematic

‘ dream sequence and yet reminds one

of the Smithsonian lnstitute’s interna-
tional hall of neon signs. Are Neuman
and Holzer testing the boundaries of
“What is Art?” or can it consciously be
labeled as so?

In the past century, photography
slowly gained recognition in salons,

subjects which rely on emotion for their
value. With the inclusion of Cindy
Sherman’s “artistic” photographs,
psychological art seems to be advanc-
ing into the realm of fears. Her “No.
143” depicts a man bitten by leaches
while holding the culprits, and her “No.

dripping from his mouth.

Though they are disturbing, it seems
that Joel-Peter Witkins’ photography
would have been a more riveting inclu-
sion. His “Sanitarium” (1983) and
“Collector of Fluids” (1983) which

“visualize the dark regions that exist '

in all of us” (American Photographer,
November 1985) with scenes of mock-
crucifixions and side-show oddities in
an expressionistic style, are turning the
photography world on its ear.

Other artists of interest include
Longo, Jan Dibbets and Clement.
Longo’s “Tongue on the Heart” (1984)
contains a cast plaster bust, a’ ham-
mered lead on wood hallway, a
durotan of ski goggles which intricate-
Iy combines depth and sensory per-
ception illusions to comment on the ex-
panding awareness of sight in our
society. In a more traditional manner,
Dibbet’s “San Casciano Ceiling” (trip-
tych 1982-84) uses optical illusion to
confuse spacial reality -— do the
beamed ceilings ever become stairs?

As for straight painting, CIemente’s
“My World War III’’ (1983-84) over-
whelmingly captures the association
between the children of the world and
the threat of nuclear obliteration. His
use of muted background tones and
humorously painted people and con-
tinents combine for an effective
presentation of one’s vision of war.

Also Lucien Freu-d’s “Naked
Woman on Sofa” (1984-85) and “Na-
ked Portrait ll” (1980-81) capitalize on
society's need for more pornographic
than erotic pictures of the naked body.

In a like vein, Eric Fischl’s use of a sex-
ually aroused young man in “Dog
Days” (1983) to exploit the ’80s view
of sexually promiscuous teen-agers
seems too explicit for tasteful con-
templation and more like a tour of

P/ayboy’s gallery of tasteful nudes-

Then again, it is the first era when
polite society has recognized sexually
explicit works as artistic.

Since the original Carnegie Institute
exhibition, a tradition of purchasing
works by “the Old Masters of Tomor-
row” has continued. Carnegie Institute
was the first American gallery to pur-
chase a work by James A. McNeilI
Whistler, and likewise, 1985 makes the
purchase of Richard Serra’s first ver-
tical American sculpture. In addition,
Serra was bestowed with a striking of
the Carnegie Prize for sculpture, as
was Anselm Keifer for his “Midgard-
Vitgard" (1980-85). His oil and emul-
sion on canvas of enormous propor-

tions incorporated the symbolism of a '

rattlesnake as the main focus on a
sploched gray-toned background,
comparable to his 1979-85 “Das

awards of $10,000 for their distinctive
works. ' I V

ritain’s eccentric songbird unveils a landmark

HOUNDS OF LOVE
Kate Bush

EMI America

For 30 years, rock music has been
fighting an uphill battle to be taken
seriously as an art form. The trouble
is that like literature, the vast majority
of what comes to public attention is
mere product, and any major innova-
tion is instantly trivialized by literally
thousands of opportunistic young for-
tune seekers who wind up making a
mockery of the whole medium. Thus,
when a really’ exciting breakthrough is
made, it may be years until the work’s
importance is acknowledged universal-
ly. It just takes time to sift it out from
the heap. Such was the case with the
Beatles’ Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts
Club Band (1967), Bob Dylan’s
Highway 61 Revisited (1966) and The
Clash’s London Calling (1979). Similar-
ly, it may take a long time for Hounds
of Love, Kate Bush’s self-produced
fifth Ip, to make its full impact. The best
record in at least five years, it brings
rock music to a major turning point.

Until now, “serious music” has
been at odds with technology. Even
respected music critics have viewed
the advent of synthesizers, drum
machines and electronic experimenta-
tion with suspicion, and for good
reason: Much of modern electronnic
music is dull, lifeless and cold. Witness
Kraftwerk, Gary Numan and, to a
degree, Laurie Anderson. Conversely,
the new technology has also been
employed to simply rewrite pop song
formulas, essentially using 20 years of
innovation as a slave to song struc-
tures and musical conventions that
date back to the ’60s and earlier.
Witness the Human League, Depeche
Mode and Howard Jones. Only a very
few artists, such as Pete Townshend
and Peter Gabriel, have attempted to
challenge the technology, to use it to
expand the perimeters of modern
music and keep it moving fonlvard.

Where does Kate Bush fit into all of
this? That's a good question. She pret-
ty much came out of nowhere in 1977,
discovered by Dave Gilmour of Pink
Floyd, and released a remarkable
debut, The Kick Inside. She was then
19. Her scope broadened considerably
when she began to play a synthesizer
called a Fairlight CMI. In 1982, after
having worked as a backup vocalist on
Peter Gabriel’s brilliant third lp, and
having obviously been influenced by
the experience, she released The
Dreaming, a masterpiece in its own
right. Bush blended light and dark,
mixing traditional Irish folk and other
acoustic instruments with synthetic
sounds, filling the album with harsh
contrasts held together by her soaring
vocal arrangements. Like Gabriel, she
employed tribal rhythms and
mythology in her songs, filtered
through oblique imagery and bizarre
wordla . The Dreamin remains a

7 Seconds

Better Youth Organization

A group like 7 Seconds makes you
feel proud to say you’re a part of the

ROCK

landmark in modern recording.

But with Hounds of Love, Bush takes
the process begun on The Dreaming
even further. Here, all facets of the in-
strumentation work in a symbiotic rela-
tionship with one another, producing
music that is as complete and satisfy-
ing as any ever recorded.

The album is in two parts: side one,
made up of five individual songs that
constitute Hounds of Love proper; and
side two, a seven-song suite with the

collective title The Ninth Wave.

The first side kicks off with “Running
Up That Hill,” an ethereal electro-
ballad with elusive, tantalizing lyrics:
And if I only could/ I ’d make a deal with
God/ And I’d get himto swap our
p/aces/ Be running up that road/ Be
running up that hill/ With no problems.

“Running” is followed by two
joyous, up-tempo pieces, “Hounds of
Love” and “The Big Sky,” each of
which dapples with spirituality and a
search for (and fear of) something
higher, whether ambition, love or God.
In “Hounds of Love” Bush yearns to
Take my shoes off and throw them in
the Iake/ And l’l/ be two steps on the
water. She finds a hunted fox: He let

underground scene. Their message is In

one of trust, unity and friendship of all
people (not just hardcores). This mini-
Ip is just restating the well known
message of the band; but only with a
little better production than we are
used to.

Unlike most hardcore bands,
vocalist Kevin Seconds sings on tune
"with clear, high-pitched melodies. But
don’t worry punks, the rest of the band

me take him in my hands/ His little heart
beats so fast/ And I ’m ashamed of run-
ning away/ From nothing real, I just
can ’t deal with this/ But I ’m still afraid
to be there/ Among your hounds of
love. In the latter song, it’s difficult to
say precisely to what she alludes with
her grand metaphor, but it’s ambigui-
ty makes it all the more effective: They
look down at the ground, missing/ But
I never go in now/ I’m looking at The
Big Sky/ You never understood me/

You never really tried.
At this point, the album's most strik-
ing feature is the astonishing drum
sound, a combination of acoustic
drums and Linn programming. By the
climax of “The Big Sky” the drums
have become a wall of percussion with
the force of heavenly thunder.
Things quiet down for “Mother
Stands for Comfort,” an eerie tale that
is not the tranquil lullaby that it seems,
with Bush wringing some unearthly
sounds out of her Fairlight and
Eberhard Weber’s fretless bass. The
side closes with the wrenchingly
beautiful “Cloudbusting,” featuring a
gripping string arrangement played by
The Medicci Sextet. The son o ’s va ue-

keeps up the tempo with a tickity-toc
troy thrash.

The first cut on the album, ‘‘In Your
Face,” is about people who try to be
punk by getting drunk, shaving their
heads and getting into fights on a
Saturday night. THIS ISN’T PUNKII
Punk is about using your head, being
aware and caring for one another —
not violence!

Also featured on the album is their

ly political lyrics are open to endless
interpretation.

In the song cycle The Ninth Wave,
recurring themes such as confinement
and alienation combine with water im-
agery to create a compelling trip
through a world filled with beauty and
terror. These songs demonstrate the
vivid contrasts that characterized The
Dreaming, moving from the high-tech
chaos of “Waking the Witch,” to the
whirling Celtic folk in “Jig of Life”
(making good use of her brothers Pad-

dy and John and other members of
the Irish band Planxty); to the gentle

piano/voice arrangement of “And
Dream of Sheep.” The Ninth Wave is
alternately placid (Being born again/ In-
to the sweet morning fog/ D’you know

’ what?/ I love you better now — “The

Morning Fog”) and terrifying (There’s
something moving under the ice/ Mov-
ing under the ice through water/ Trying
to get out of the cold water/ lt’s Me -
“Under |ce”). In terms of conceptualiz-
ing a theme and realizing it on vinyl,
The Ninth Wave is perhaps the most
successfully unified album side since
side two of Abbey Road.

But the most impressive aspect of
the album is the singing. While shrewd
uses of backing vocalists highlight
some of the songs (especially The
Richard Hickox Singers in “Hello
Earth”), it is Bush herself who carries
the day. Unlike on her early lps, she
no longer tries to explore the full four-
‘octave range of her voice on every
song. Instead, she entwines melody
upon melody in the foreground and in
the background, overdubbing herself
into whole choirs when necessary.
This is not to suggest that the produc-
tion reaches overkill. Most of the songs
center around a single melody, but
with an amazing range of vocal tex-
tures supporting it. Given the amount
of instruments and voices on some of
the tracks, it is astounding that the
sound remains crystal-clear, never
muddy.

Hounds of Love is a milestone
because it brings together widely
disparate musical styles, instruments
and techniques and makes them work
together with a sustained level of'quali-
ty and accessibility rarely before
achieved. Not only this, but in the pro-
cess it utilizes all of the most advanced
production capabilities to form a record
of endless depth, clarity and listenabili-
ty. it set a new standard with which all
further serious recording projects must
necessarily be judged. In her ability to
process complex technology and mu-
sical concepts with her own genius,
Kate Bush is years ahead of her time.
She is not an intellectual snob making
“difficult” music for its own sake —— far
from it. She is simply a great artist
making full use of all the resources
available to her. This is an important
record.

EATEN ALIVE
Diana Ross
RCA Records

In the last few years Diana Ross has
worked with some of the most affluent
producers in the music business (Ray
Parker Jr., Bernard Edwards, Lionel
Richie, Daryl Hall and Richard Perry —
just to name a few), but it’s not until we
actually open her latest album Eaten
Alive that we find it’s produced by
Barry Gibb. Ross, who in the past has
consistently chosen to work with a
variety of producers and songwriters,
has entrusted the Bee Gees, even
brother Andy, with writing almost all of
the material.

As a result, Eaten Alive is too easy
an album to make for a singer as
talented as Diana Ross. She glides
through this album like a Boeing 747,
barely leaving any skidmarksin the
sky, barely challenging the constant
dum-bum-bum Bee Gees’ beat. In fact,

"°~“W“§\>\ 

   

Barry Gibb’s vocal clarity as backup.

singer on the choruses of _ “Ex-
perience” and “Don’t Give Up On
Each Other” is so apparent that it’s
hard to tell these are Diana Ross
‘songs in the. first place.

But Eaten Alive is not a total disaster
— not by any means. it’s advertised as
a “major musical event” and, at times,
it is. The lively, wistful title cut has
Michael Jackson stamped all over it;
he co-wrote and co-produced, sings
backup and probably lent some for the
video idea, which is just a sequel to his
own “Thriller.” Lyrics are brave and
lascivious: You can rip my shirt/Drag
me in the dirt.

Daring, too, are the lyrics from the

  

two tracks that revive the ambitious

quality Ross boasted in the days of the
Supremes. On “Crime of Passion,”
she admits Whenever I’m with you/I
lose control and on “Chain Reaction,"
she confesses You make me tremble
when your hand goes lower. Both
songs pulsate with more post-
Supremes excitement than Diana
Ross has mustered since “So Close”
from the Silk Electric album from 1982.

But, overall, there’s too much Barry
Gibb on this album and n.ot enough
Diana Ross (Gibb had virtually the
same problem when he produced an
album for Dionne Warwick a few years
back.) This time around, Ross should
have stuck with a formula she’s used
in the past — a variety of song writers
and producers. Given the courageous
nature of the title cut, the whole album
is too sweet and sour and should have
been more of a party. If Diana Ross
had set out to make a margarita, she
should have at least been willing to

.add a little more tequila.

BELIEVE YOU ME
Blancmange
Sire

Imagine INXS with no punch. Imag-
ine Depeche Mode with no heart. Im-
agine Modern English with no pop
gloss. If you’re having difficulty conjur-
ing up ideas, Blancmange’s Believe
You Me could very well “make them
concrete for you.

So this is the story of an album about
to be trashed, right? Well, not quite.

The two-man team of keyboardist
Stephen Luscombe and drum-

mer/vocalist Neil Arthur occasionally ,

offers some engaging material. The
dramatic, gentle keyboard-layered
“Lose Your Love” opens the record
stylishly enough. And along the way,
the flute and cello-textured “Why Don’t
They Leave Things Alone?”, the
classically-flavored “Lorraine’s My
Nurse” and the drifting instrumental
“John” show some originality.

Most of the remainder of the record,
however, falls flat. Be it the percolating
electronic clicks replacing actual drum-
ming, the mechanical synthesizer riffs

dominating the arrangements or the’

blurred musical focus of many of the
tracks, Believe You Me becomes
frustrating and tiresome to listen to.s

    
   

The song “22339” shows Blanc-
mange at their most muddled. Brief
guitar snatches and tense singing of-
fer some initial interest. But the nearly
dronin mu ' and bewildering lyrics

 

   

I am a fish. tank/I am a bird cage  you
should be there that seem to describe
some inexplicable scenario sour any
high expectations. '

Luscombe and Arthur certainly
utilize a variety of instruments —‘ in-
cluding oboes, tablas and a flugelhorn
— and don’t hesitate to experiment
with their arrangements. But too often
their best musical intentions get lost in
a tangled techno-jungle and leave
Blancmange sounding drab instead of
vibrant. Consequently, Believe You Me
falls far short of its demonstrated
potential.

IAFTERBURNER
ZZ Top
Warner Bros.

With guitar solos, comical lyrics and
phlanged vocals in abundance, ZZ Top
has re-emerged with their first album
in overtwo and a half years. After-
burner differs from the band’s previous
records in places but still contains
numerous three-chord frat party dance

anthems and glossy, ideal-for-video -

pop tracks that would have sounded
just as at home on Eliminator.

Even more than on Eliminator, After-
burner features synthesizers to fill up
the mix. Sometimes such techno-
trimmings go virtually unnoticed, but
on songs like “Stages," the keyboards
break into full chords, and on the first
single, “Sleeping Bag,” brief flashes

mechanized sound reminient 0
Trevor Horn’s production tricks pop in
occasionally. Surprisingly enough, no-
one is credited with playing keyboards-
on the album.

with Z Top’s brand of blues-tinges,
basic rock, one might expect some of I
the band's material to sound similar
after 15 years. But the obvious self-
plagiarism of Afterburner is un-

necessary; the keyboard part on-

‘‘Planet Of Women” is identical to Bil-
ly Gibbons’ guitar lick in “Got Me
Under Pressure,” and “Dipping-Low
[In The Lap Of Luxury]” features the
exact same chord progression as
“Gimme All Your Lovin’.”

But despite my gripes about some

recycling of songs and the fact that

some of the record seems designed ‘

purposely for videos, (You don't sup-

  
   

ose the boys’ll take off for the “Planet
Of Women” in the outer-space version

of their trademark car featured on '
Afterburner’s cover, do you?) I'd have ,

to call Afterburner a top-notch album
of enjoyable Texas-brand pop rock.
Tracks like “Can’t Stop Rockin’,”
“Stages,” “Delirious” and “VELCRO
Fly,” with its big drum sound and
metaphorical lyrics, are all, well — fun.
The slow ballad “Rough Boy” scores,
too, with an uncharacteristic Gibbons
guitar solo and tongue-in-cheek lyrics.

lnstrumentally, ZZ Top is dead-‘on

'.throughout the album. Gibbons’

trustworthy leads’ (T here’s one or more
in every song.) wail, scream and mum-
ble as necessary, Dusty Hill's bass
lines rollick along, and Frank Beard,
whose drumming sounds more elec-
tronic than usual, implements a‘ big
back beat and steady pounding.

If you listen to Afterburner without
expecting the gritty blues of ZZ Top’s
yesteryears, chances are you’ll get
caught up in the fun,-frenzied rock-n-K
roll of 22 Top, circa 1985, and just en-
joy some hot party music. I wonder if
the same three ladies will be back in
the '33 Ford for this round of videos?

By David Zuchowski

This week, a period in which the
Pittsburgh Symphony remains dor-
mant and quiescent, is one in which
Dama Fortuna has played an in-
teresting musical scheduling prank on
the area’s audiophiies. For, whether by
quirk or by design, both the New Music
Ensemble and the Renaissance and

' Baroque Society are slated for concert

performances. The New Music Ensem-
ble is scheduled to perform on Mon-
day, Nov. 18, 1985 at the Campbell
Memorial Chapel at Chatham College
at 8 p.m. Those of you who have in-
tended on catching a PNME concert
but have put it off for one reason or
another had better catch this one as
it's the last one until March 3, 1986.

In conjunction with the Carnegie In-
ternational Art Exposition, the PNME
will feature compositions international
in scope by Po|and’s Witold
Lutoslawski (“Chain l”), Mexico’s
Carlos Chavez (“Energiia”), and
Romania's Gheorghe Costinescu
(“Jubilus”). “Jubilus” was commis-
sioned by Radio Visions and will be
sung by Ensemble soprano Lynne
Webber, a graduate of the University
of Pittsburgh’s Graduate School of
Music and a voice instructor at the
Pittsburgh School for the Creative and
Performing Arts. Ms. Webber has been
described by Donald Menahan of The
New York Times as “a soprano who

turns a work’s difficulties into fun.”'
Partly because it will also be
American Music Week, this Ensemble
will also perform conductor David
Stock’s “Parallel Worlds,” which saw
its premiere last May at the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

Last, but by no means least, will be
a premiere by Lou Coyners, chairman
of the Humanities Department of
Chatham College, entitled “Solo Sax-
ophone with Ensemble” performed by
world renowned saxophonist John
Sampen. Student tickets are available

Classical music at its chronological extremes

entrance to the Composer Reception
held immediately after the perform-
ance. For further information call
244-9996.

At the other end of the musical
chronological spectrum will be the Lon-
don Early Music Group’s stint with the
Renaissance and Baroque Society’s
concerts on Saturday, Nov. 16, 1985
at Synod Hall, 125 North Craig Street
in Oakland at 8:30 p.m.

The program is entitled “English
and Italian Music for Theatre, Court
and Opera by Henry Purcell and the
Most Fam’d Italian Masters.” Henry
Purcell is one of the great composers
of the Baroque Era and one of the
greatest of all English composers. The

concert will feature both his works and .
those of his most formative pro-'

genitors, Draghi, Matteis, Stradella,
Cavalli, Monteverdi and Melli, whose
work “Lute Solo: Capricio” dates back
to 1616, a distant work when com-
-pared to the PNME’s Coyner premiere.

The London Early Music Group will
perform this “ancient” music, headed
by James Tyler who formed the group
in 1976. The Group will play such
relatively unknown and rare in-
struments as the tenor viol, theorbo
and baroque cello. The evening’s com-
positions are the forerunners of opera,
the contata and the violin repertoire.

' Student tickets are $7. For additional

information call 682-7262.

It starts at birth. The doctor yells,
“C’mon, give a push for Uncle Joe!”
Then, a few seconds later, a new Penn

Stater is brought into the world. Sure,_

he’ll look like the rest of the babies in
the nursery, except for the blue and
white diapers.

It gets worse. The child’s parents

coax his first words with, “WE ARE 
The day the child replies, “PENN
STATE,” is a stellar one. His parents
call the admissions office out at Hap-
py Valley to reserve a place for junior
in eighteen years. ‘

As the other little boys in grammar
school collect baseball cards, the little
Paternoite is busy memorizing PSU’s‘
win/loss record from the past twenty
years. He’s happy to do it, though; I
mean, what else is there in life?

High School — remember those
years of growing pains? Always wor-
ried about your complexion, the cute
girl in history class and your first car
date — well, these problems are
secondary to the pubescent Lion. He’s
more concerned with wearing a dif-
ferent piece of PSU-wear every day of
the week and D.J. Dozier’s pulled
hamstring.

Then it happens — the most prized
day in a Stater’s life, the day he actual-
ly goes to Penn State. He’ll room with
his best friend from second grade,
they’ll pick a fraternity together, they’ll
tailgate together.  God, the American

That struck a chord in me which said,
‘This is a book which could make a dif-
ference. It’s an intelligent book, and it

Whether it is or not — and it's not
— isn’t the point. The point is that he’s
really trying.

Intelligent teen films —.films that
deal more directly with the delicate
emotional balance of America’s teen-
scape and do not just exploit the symp-
toms of serious social dilemmas — are
something, Estevez feels strongly
about. Although he calls That Was
Then his swansong to teen film, he
is glad to have been involved in films
like The Outsiders and The Breakfast
Club and considers them part of a
larger, positive trend in youth film.

‘‘I think,” said Estevez, “that many
studios do feel there’s an audience out
there for this kind of sexploitation film
— and maybe there is. lt’s like if you
feed someone junk food their whole
life. They don’t know the difference
between junk food and health food. If
you finally start feeding them health
food, it takes them a while to pick up
on it, but eventually they realize that
the health food makes them feel bet-
ter. |t’s the same with good films.”

For his part in this new trend in youth

' film, Estevez, because of an article in

a major New York magazine, was
tagged as a member of a group of
young over-achieving actors called
“The Brat Pack.” This was something
that caught the young actor off guard.

“The Brat Pack is really a laughable
thing right now,” Estevez said. “You
know, you can’t give it any credence.

You can get angry and upset, but it's ,

just a waste of energy. The writer
neglected to see that there was this
group of young men who are hard-

working individuals, who care about V’-

theircraft. He exploited a night out with

Dream lives.

l’m kind of curious, though. Where
do Penn State fans learn to, be so
damn arrogant? Do they have a class
out there for it?

A few questions I pose to you
responsible readers:

— How many places do you know
that name an entire town after a foot-
ball team?

 

l’ve been to the football games at
State College many times. They’re
really fun; that is, if you're rooting for
the sainted Lions. If you are cheering
for their opponent, you have to enter
Beaver Stadium through a special en-
trance and be quiet for the entire
game, lest you be marshmallowed by
the hospitable Staters.

the guys. It was just written from a very
bitchy point of view. I think the author’s
jealousy came out a lot in that piece
— certainly not.his intelligence.”

Did the “Brat Pack,” ironically, end
up forwarding their careers and their
projects?

 

press IS as good as good press as long
as they spell your name right. I don’t
know — it’s made me really guarded.
As far as the press goes, l’ve come in
here with a suit of armor. l’m just more
prepared now.”

With the exception of the off-beat,
cliche-packed, punker comedy Fiepo
Man in which Estevez played a hard-
core car repossessor, his career has
progressed in an extremely coherent
and steady fashion, after-school
specials to TV dramas to feature-
length youth dramas to writing
screenplays. Next, Estevez will direct
and star in one of the three original

‘ screenplays he’swritten this year. The

film but from that kind of film.

‘‘I just did an action film,” he
declared almost confessionally,

— What is the emblem on their

— Why are Penn State’s uniforms
so exciting? .
Enough of that. All I know is that
next week, our city (which happens to
be No. 1 in the country — how ‘bout
that, fellas?) will be infested with
thousands of Penn State fans scream-
ing for an undefeated season. As
we’ve been in the past, I know that
we’ll be again — classy. We won’t be
the rude fans. We won’t be the ones
who hound the refs. We won’t be the

. ones giving everybody in a Pitt sweat-

shirt ahard time. We will be the ones
who are behind our players, but not all
over the PSU players.

My column is supposed to be a style
column. Well, I just wanted to remind
everyone that Pitt fans have style and
class. I remember just one short year
ago, when the Staters were all riled up
to beat on a weak Pitt team, and that-

~ the same weak team went out and

kicked some lion tail.

Pitt has as good a team as anyone.
Yeah, we’ve had problems lately, but
this is the time to get ready for our big-
gest win of the year, and their biggest
loss of the year.

There's nothing like a quiet Penn
State fan.

style may be sent to:

— yeah, I did an action film. I played
the hero, I got the girl, and I blew
everything up."

Estevez said that he’s become
thoroughly comfortable in front of the
camera. “Whatever happens hap-
pens!” he exclaimed. ‘‘If a fly lands on

your head, what are you going to do ,

— you going to leave it there because
it's not_ in the script? No! you’re going
to get rid of it!”

But what if a fly lands on your
typewriter or your camera? What about
writing and directing? Can .a young
man without formal training and no
more than five years experience risk
his reputation at such an early stage
in his career? Will Emilio Estevez be
remembered as a solid actorlwriterl

director or as a kid with a lot of talent .

and aspiration but no patience? Can
this lad keep pace with his career?
“Yes, I think so,” he said, looking
up and tapping his feet together slow-
ly. “Ithink that I bring to each perform-
ance 23 years of my life’s experiences,
and l’m not capable of bringing 26 or
27 years into it. So every year I grow,

and every performance I grow. I learn ‘

something new. I learn something new
about myself every time. l’ve got a lot
of confidence in what I can do and
what I can’t do. A_nd every time l’m
learning what life has to offer me. To

of my life right now — it’s not like l’m
stepping over people to the top. l’m

control-oriented than power-hungry. I - "

like to control what’s going on both in
front [of] and behind the camera. I feel
for my vision to be realized, l’ve got to
take the helm.”

Estevez stops tapping his feet and
leans farther back in his chair. ‘‘I think

Heavmetal trudges on,

By Jim Urban

“The Law of Yukon that only the strong
shall thrive: That surely the weak shall
perish, and only the fit survive."

- The Law of Yukon

in music, just as in life, only the
strong survive. The “strong” of the
music world lie in the heavy metal and
hard rock categories. How many times
have we seen artists from the pop, soul
or country music categories have one
or two hits, then fizzle into the twilight?
Does anybody remember Gerry Raffer-
ty? He got lost somewhere on Baker
Street. What about Matthew Wilder?
Somebody broke his stride. How about
Dexy’s Midnight Runners? I won’t
even touch that one.

Now put your focus on the world of
heavy metal. These are the movers

, and shakers of the music business. Do

you remember Jimmy Page? How
about Paul Rodgers? These two musi-
cians anchored two popular bands in
the late ’70s, Page with Led Zeppelin
and Rodgers with Bad Company, and
now combine to anchor one of this

year’s better new bands. The Firm.~

so goes ‘the law of the Yukon’

the 20th most popular album in the na-
tion, according to Billboard magazine’s

‘ weekly rankings. Powered by local and

national hit “Tears Are Falling,” it

' looks as if Kiss’ solid but elderly foun-

dation of bassist Gene Simmons and
lead singer Paul Stanley are in for a
few more years of metal madness.
A local radio station further supports
this point that heavy metal and hard
rock are the powers behind the music
industry. This radio’ station airs a
special segment each day called
“Classic Tracks.” Now take a guess
what kind of music is played at this
time. It is always music from the late
’60s and early ’70s, and it is
predominantly hard rock. You will not
hear too much Stevie Wonder here.

It is all very easy to see. Whether
you are in a bar, in your car or at home
listening to your stereo, one is just as
likely to hear a 1972 Led Zeppelin
classic as you are a 1985 Stevie
Wonder song. The catch is that you will
most likely hear a 1972 Led Zeppelin
classic before you will ever hear an
early '70s Stevie Wonder hit. That is
just the way it is. Heavy metal and hard
rock stick around, while pop, soul and
country hits are popular for a while,
then they get tossed aside.

It takes a special quality to survive
in the music business — strength. This
is one quality that most heavy metal
and hard rock bands possess. That is
why the rockers will be around for a
while — only the strong survive.

The Pitt News, November 15, 1985

Are all Pitt sports treated equally?

By Randy Miller
Assistant Sports Editor

Pitt is known for its successful
basketball and football programs,
which annually bring in millions of
dollars to the school. Plenty of time and
money is spent ‘by the Pitt athletic
department publicizing these athletes.

Football and basketball are only two
of 15 varsity teams at Pitt, however.
And despite the fact that many of these
hard-working athletes’ feats go un-
noticed, the Pitt Sports Information
Department gives non—revenue sports
the same treatment as money—making
sports.

“We do the same for non-revenue
sports as we do for ‘football and basket-
ball. Only on a smaller scale,” said
Linda Venzon, Pitt’s assistant sports in-
formation director. “There is just as
much emphasis and enthusiasm in the
non-revenues. We call television sta-
tions to set up interviews, do press
releases and set up prepared ﬂyers.”

In addition, Sports Information
Director Jim O’Brien, with the aid of
Venzon, put together a classy “All-
Spoits Media Guide” to help the
media. The guide was awarded best in
the nation among Division I schools.

To stimulate interest, basketball
double-headers have been set up with
the women’s team playing before the
regularly scheduled men’s game. ‘

“At halftime in our game, the gym
is nearly half full,” said women’s
basketball coach Kirk Bruce. “It gives
people a chance to see us play, and it
gives us a home-court advantage.”

Still, media attention is almost
always centered on the popular football
and basketball.

By Patrick Good
Staff Writer

Now in his sixth year as head coach,
Rande Stottlemyer is expecting this
year’s wrestling team to be the best he’s
coached.

Stottlemyer should have good reason
to be optimistic for the upcoming year
as he returns every starter from last

season’s team that recorded an 8-7 dual 

meet record. Among the returning let-
termen there will be five seniors who
will provide the leadership on what is

“I understand football brings in
money,” said Keith Shuster, a pitcher
on the Pitt baseball team. “I think we
should get some recognition for play-
ing, though. That part bothers me.”

Other than not being swarmed with
reporters, Shuster or any other Pitt
athlete can’t complain. Pitt_’_§_non-

revenue athletes have access to the
finest benefits and facilities possible,
according to Dean Billick, Pitt’s
associate athletic director.

“We call them varsity sports here,”
said Billick, “and our varsity sports are
getting as much financialhelp and top

equipment we can physically afford.”

For instance, the swim team has the
privilege of using an Olympic-size
pool. The Big East Conference has
thought so highly of Trees Pool that Pitt
hosts the conference championships
each year.

Pitt coaches and administrators agree that the school does a good job of spreading
the wealth around...from gymnastics to basketball.

Stottlemyer returns strong team,
looks toward successful season

a rather young and inexperienced team.

Though the Panther grapplers have-
barely begun the season, they’ve
already suffered a loss. Sophomore
Ken Hackman has left the university in

. mid-terrn, which is a big loss when you

consider that the 190-lb. grappler
finished fourth at the Eastern Cham-
pionships and was named fourth team
freshman All-America by Amateur
Wrestling News.

Coach Stottlemyer explained the
reason for the departure of Hackman:
“Ken’s decision was purely academic.

Tomorrow night’s season-
opening exhibition game for the Pitt
men’s basketball team against the
Puerto Rico National Team is free
to the first 2,000 students who show
a validated Pitt I.D.

The game, which will begin at 8
p.m., will feature open seating for
all who attend, but only the first
2,000 students will be admitted free
of charge. All other students
wishing to enter must purchase a

for admission to game

general admission ticket. Pitt
basketball publicist Kimball Smith
indicated that a large crowd is ex-
pected, so students best get there
early.

This is the only game that
students will be admitted to with
only an I.D. Students will have to
obtain a ticket (free of charge to Pitt
students) from the William Pitt
Union ticket office for the re-
mainder of the Pitt home games on
the schedule.

is getting tough, but is it too —- ‘ ‘

He thought the university didn't offer
his desired course of study and then
found out otherwise too late.”

The Panthers are also in jeopardy of
losing their top performer to a redshirt.
Gary Bolin, a senior from Shaler High
School who last year capped off a 27-9
record with an Eastern Wrestling
League championship at 150 lbs. , may
be lost to injury.

“Gary has been suffering from a
shoulder problem,” commented Coach
Stottlemyer, “but a ﬁnal decision has
yet to be made on whether he’ll be
given the redshirt or not.”

The loss to Bolin will hurt very
much, but the Panthers do return
several other top performers. Senior
John Hnath returns from a 24—win
season and a bid to the NCAA tourna-
ment along with Bolin, after placing
third at the EWL championships.

For Stottlemyer, Hnath presents an
interesting athlete to coach. “John
Hnath is one of those guys who never
quits and battles you to the end,” he
said. “John is also one of the most
coachable members of our team.”

Another apple in the eye of Coach
Stottlemyer is Kyle Nellis, the 134-lb.
starter for the Panthers. In his senior
season, Nellis will make a run at the

schools,” said Bruce. “Our Nautilus
equipment is the same as the men’s
team, we use the same gymnasium.
Many schools use a little shabby gym
to practice in, but we use the Field
House. The girls get first-class treat-
ment, and we’re academically second
to none.”

There are priorities, Billick noted.

“None of our varsity sports are ful-
ly funded as far as scholarships go,”
Billick said. “Naturally, we’d like to

have every athlete on scholarship. The’

athletic department decides the overall
decisions on the budgets, and we do the
best we possibly can. We give each
coach a budget, and it’s up to them to
decide how to use it.”

In varsity sports, track and women’s

basketball is stressed, according to

Billick. “But we have equal expenses
and an equal budget for men’s and
women’s varsity sports, not including
football and men’s basketball.”

Thus, non—revenue teams do have
some of the same luxuries as the foot-
ball team, which includes ﬂying to
some away games.

“As a coach, you always want
more,” said Pitt track and ﬁeld coach
John Vasvary. “But we’re never going
to fill a stadium, and that’s a fact. We
still want to do as much for our athletes
as we can. We want to create publici-
ty because we work just as hard as
anyone. It hurts to have achievements
go unnoticed because I know what kind
of time they put into it.” ‘

In spite of the fact that Pitt’s non-
revenue sports will always play second
fiddle to the basketball and football
teams, everything is being done to give
them an education and a fair shot to
display their abilities as athletes.

Miller Time

Fazio ﬁnally means business this week

By Randy Miller
Assistant Sports Editor

Foge Fazio has been the Pitt head
football coach for four years. He has
earned a reputation of being one of the
nicest human beings anyone could
meet. He has earned the label of being
an outstanding recruiter and bringing
in loads of talent. '

For whatever the reason, his squads
have not reached their potential in the
past two seasons. Last year, a squad
that was ranked No. 3 in the pre-season
ﬁnished at a pitiful 3-7-1. This year,
Pitt had the talent to ﬁnish at least 8-3,
yet after 10 games they have only an
average 5-4-1 record. Only top-ranked
Penn State remains on Pitt’s schedule.

Fazio’s job is on the line and he

. knows it. Goodbye Mr. Nice Guy,

hello football coach. It may be too late,
but it seems Fazio is changing his ways
to a degree by getting tough with the
media.

It will_not salvage the season, and
may not save Fazio his job, but Pitt will
defeat top-ranked Penn State next
weekend.

The Panthers, after 10 weeks of
lackadaisical play, are eagerly awaiting
the unbeaten Nittany Lions. Sure, Pitt
is out for revenge. In 1981, Penn State
shocked the undefeated Panthers in Pitt
Stadium 48-14, eliminating the chance
of a national championship. The shoe
is on the other foot this year with the
Nittany Lions in a position to win the
national championship, which would be
their second in four years.

Sure, Fazio will have Pitt ready for
their archrivals because his team has
played its ﬁnest football against the
strongest opponents. At Ohio State, the
Panthers played their best game of the
season in a 10-7 loss against the third-
ranked Buckeyes. Likewise, Pitt looked
impressive in the 10-10 tie at West
Virginia. Only missed ﬁeld goals kept
the Panthers from winning both games.

Directly after last week’s 21-17 win
at Temple, Fazio began preparing for
their season ﬁnale by closing the Pitt
locker room. It was closed because
“we’re getting ready for Penn State,”
said Fazio.

   
   

In fact, in his post-game interview,
he appeared upset when reporters ques-
tioned the way he used halfback
Charles Gladman. “The kid is hurt,"
Fazio snapped. “His ribs are killing
him.” ‘

Fazio and his team have been the vic-
tims of severe media criticism for most
of the past two years. Whether or not
it has affected the team’s play, Fazio
has decided to close the team’s locker
room next week in preparing for Penn
State. ‘

Good move, Foge. This will keepthe

players’ minds on the game. Quarter-
back John Congemi will take the most

advantage of this move, not having to.

answer reporters’ questions con-
tinuously on Pitt’s faulty passing attack.

It seems Fazio is dead serious about
beating Penn State. My only question
to Fazio is, “Why did you wait so long
in getting tough?” Sure, his players
love him dearly, but his objective as a
football coach is to winfootball games.
The past two years he has not.

As I see it

A Page 214 

By Jim Brueckner

Rocky IV: Can it TKO one of the 10 all-time great sports ﬂicks?

In a few short weeks, “Rocky IV”
will be the No. 1 movie in America
(money-wise). This is no brash predic-
tion. We all know the drawing power
of this series. The only question is, how
many millions will it make?

Sports movies have always been
popular. They even attract the non-fan
with regularity. Everyone has their
favorites, and here’s my top 10
favorites.

1) “Requiem For A Heavyweight”
— I’m referring to the film version (not
the TV movie). Jackie Gleason as the
manager and Mickey Rooney as the
trainer turned in ﬁne performances. But
it is because of Anthony Quinn’s per-
formance in the lead role that makes
this one my favorite. In fact, I would
rate it as the best I have ever seen in
a sports movie. This is a moving story
about what happens when an athlete
reaches the end of his career and ﬁnds
that he has no money and is not
prepared to move onto another line of
work.

2) “The Winning Team” — This
baseball classic features Ronald Reagan
as one of the greatest pitchers ever,
Grover Cleveland Alexander. Alex-
ander’s life needed no “Hoolywoodiz—
ing” it was one of the most
facinating in all of sports history.
Blessed with an abundance of natural
talent, he had one weakness: alcohol.

Doris Day only adds to the excellence

of the movie as Alexander’s boyhood

sweetheart/wife.
3) “Rocky” — Although all of them

~ were impressive, the original is, so far,

the best. While it’s true that the ﬁlm
is widely known because of its stirring
musical score, the reason for the ﬁlm’s
popularity is that it is one of the most
perfectly cast movies ever. Each of the
main characters was portrayed by the
actor/actress best suited for that role.
Sylvester Stallone as Rocky and
Burgess Meredith as Mickey both
turned in Oscar—level performances.

4) “Knute Rockne All-American”
— Speaking of movies being well cast,
isn’t it amazing how much Pat O’Brien
resembled the real Rockne in this
movie? Reagan very admirably por-
trayed another great athlete in this
movie, George Gipp. But the ﬁlm was
dominated by O’Brien, a man who
starred in over 100 movies. This was
a major highlight in his illustrious
career. This movie more than aptly
shows ‘why Rockne is a legend as a
coach and as a man.

5) “The Bad News Bears” — As sil-
ly as it is, I love this movie. Actually,
this movie is not all that outrageous.
I have seen Little League teams like the
Bears. What made this a standout (and
far better than the two sequels) was the
team of Walter Matthau and Tatum
O’Neal. Both were totally believable

65

characters who made you get in-
volved” in the movie. You couldn’t
help but cheer for this rag-tag bunch
of misfits.

6) “Raging Bull” — This movie was
released in 1981 yet it was filmed in
black and white, a technique that I
loved. I thought that it somehow made
that movie more dramatic. Anyhow,
Robert DeNiro’s portrayal of Jake
LaMotta was right up there with An-
thony Quinn’s for the best ever in a
sports movie. I loved it at the end when
LaMotta turned to Sugar Ray Robin_-
son, after Robinson had just handed
LaMotta one of the worst beatings in
ring history, and said, “I never went
down, Ray. I never went down.”
Despite ﬁghting many of the all-time
greats, LaMotta never was knocked
down.

7) “The Great John L.” — This ﬁlm
told the tale of the legendary
heavyweight champion John L.
Sullivan. The story of this turn-of-the-
century brawler from Boston is very
unoriginal, but Greg»McClure made it
fascinating with his brilliant perfor-
mance. Sullivan was a rough and crude
man yet possessed a kind of class that
was all his own. He was brash and
cocky but only in regard to his vast
degree of athletic skill. Outside of the
ring, he felt himself no better than
anyone else. But he grew too accus-
tomed to fancy living, and his skills_

began to suffer. This story has been
told before, but McClure made it work
because he made you believe that he
was John L. Sullivan.

8) “Semi-Tough” — A similar ﬁlm
(“North Dallas Forty”) was preferred
by some people, but I like this one
much better. I think it’s because Burt
Reynolds seemed to be the perfect ac-
tor for playing a star running back. It
seemed as though when Dan Jenkins
wrote the novel, he pictured Burt nar-
rating it in the character of Billy Clyde.

9) “Monkey On My Back” —A
Although this movie isn’t really about
sports, it is so good that I just had to
include it. It is the story of former
welterweight champion Barney Ross’
trouble with drugs. It’s a sad story
because he is not the one who causes
the addiction. Ross was a brave man,
both in the ring and in life. He became
addicted while being treated in a
military hospital after becoming a war
hero.

10) “Slapshot” — Okay, I know.
You thought that the movie was vulgar
and violent, right? I agree. But it was
hysterical. I especially loved when the
goalie was on the talk-show and was
demonstrating all of the various
penalties on the host.

But seriously, I felt that the movie
had a lot to say about some of the fans’
view of hockey. Fortunately, I think

that has changed in the last few years.-
I think that fewer and fewer people are
watching hockey to see the ﬁghting.
Maybe this had an impact — it did with.
me. —

Excuse me if I left out any of your
favorites. But then again, I haven't seen
them all. Here’s a few that I look for-
ward to seeing in the near future: “The
Harder They Fall,” “Somebody Up
There Likes Me,” “Angels In The
Outf1eld,” “Chariots Of Fire,” and
“The Natural.”

Actually, I can’t just stop at 10
movies. I would like to add to my list
the following honorable mentions:
“The Great White Hope” tells the
story of the controversial Jack Johnson.
This one really puts you on Johnson’s
side. “Satch” is the story of the legen-
dary Satchel Page. “Bingo Long’s
Traveling All Stars and Motor Kings”
is a hilarious movie about a barnstorm—
ing black baseball team in the days of
the Negro Leagues. “Brian’s Song”
tells of the tragic story of Brian Pic-
colo and his relationship with Gale
Sayers. And of course, we must add
“Rocky II” and “Rocky III” to that
list.

Just how good will “Rocky IV” do?
We’ll see. But I’ll bet it’s a knockout!
Oh, was that bad. Stop the article! The
readers are absorbing too much
punishment! _ '

The Pittsburgh Hockey Club
demolished Slippery Rock 12-2 Sunday
on the Rockets’ home ice in Meadville.
The Panthers had little trouble rolling
over Slippery Rock although they were
forced to dodge a heavy fog which
plagued the ice for most of the game.
“You couldn’t see what was going
on,” explained right wing Roger
Oldaker.

Left wing Tim Ross proved his
worth to the Panther offense once again
by scoring four goals and two assists,
leading Pitt to its second regular season
wm.

Although the Panthers won the game
easily, there was something about the
style of play Sunday that made team
captain Jim Owens Jr. uncomfortable.
“We played really well in the first
period, but then everybody started get-
ting individualistic and going after
goals for themselves,” he explained.

Pitt faces some tough competition
this weekend in Navy, and the Panthers
will have to pool their resources if they
expect to sink the Midshipmen.
“There’s no way Timmy Ross can beat
them by himself. Everyone will have
to work together,” said Owens.

Unlike many club teams, Navy has
the opportunity to practice every day,
and they have a reputation of being

very disciplined. Although Pitt’s two- _

game bout with Navy this weekend will
be exhibition play, the Panthers will be
tested on their ability to work as a team
against some stiff competition.

“Navy is pretty rough,” said
Oldaker. “They’re not out to killyou;
they’re just out to play ,a hard game.
They’re police. They’ll knock you in-
to the boards and knock you down, but
then they’ll reach down and pick you
up. Maybe we’ll find out what we’re
made of this weekend.”

players resented his strict ways, but the
results were incredible.

“To show you how tough Jackie
was,” said former Pitt fullback Wayne
DiBartola, a four—year lettermanunder
Sherrill, “I remember being called for
il-legal motion in one game where I

didn’t do it. The films clearly showed .

I didn’t move, but Jackie said, ‘The
refs said you moved and if you ever do
it again, you’ll never play again.’ It
made me a better player.”

In DiBartola’s final three years under
Sherrill, Pitt had three consecutive
years where they finished at an.incred-

season record, a win here could give
the Panthers the conﬁdence needed to
pull off a championship season.
“We’re way above club level, and

us as long as we work hard.” S 7

This weekend the Panthers will nee
to do just that — work hard as a team.
Only then will a victory on Midship-
man ice be possible.

“Anybody can score goals,” said
Ross, “but if you set your teammates
up, an assist can give you a lot more
satisfaction.”

to finish 1'1-1 every year, but winning
just eight games in two years is uncalled
for.

Fazio knows his football and has the
qualities to be an outstanding football
coach. There is no one who can coach
defense like Fazio, yet the defense has
struggled. The offense has been nil at
times, despite having top—notch people

‘in almost every position.

My only complaint about Fazio is his
method of motivating his team. His
friendly attitude has only allowed lesser
teams to take advantage of the un-
motivated Panthers. There is no way

Pitt should be winless in consecutive
years against Navy.

Fazio has begun to change, though.
He took a page out of Sherrill’s book
in getting tough with the press.

“Sherril1 really controlled the
press,” DiBartola said. “He always
was reminding us to be careful in what
we said to the press.”

The results worked for Sherrill. And
for Fazio they will produce a victory
over Penn State, a team the Panthers
haven’t beaten in Pitt Stadium since
1965.

Good luck, Foge,

Jelic. Thus far in three seasons, Nellis
has recorded 68 career wins which
leaves him just 13 behind Jelic’s 81 vic-

One person pulling for Nellis’ record
attempt is Jelic himself. “I hope he
goes out there and breaks my record,”
he said. “Kyle is a good friend of
mine, and records like that are not go-
ing to stand forever.”

For Nellis’, his accomplishments
don’t end on the wrestling mat — they
just begin. “Kyle is the epitome of the
scholar—athlete,” said Stottlemyer.
-“He carries a 3.2 grade average in the
electrical engineering program.”

As for the team as a whole Stot-
tlemyer is quite enthusiastic. “What we
hope to accomplish is to build on last
season’s finish inthe Easterns,” he
said, “and also we’d like to have bet-
ter results in nationals from an in-
dividual standpoint.”
