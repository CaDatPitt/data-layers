Pitt prepares for swine ﬂu

Pitt works on a plan after Carnegie Mellon’s H1N1 scare, but local’ officials say not to panic

I_.iz Navratil
News Editor

Suspected cases of the swine ﬂu are
surfacing at schools like Penn State
and neighboring Carnegie Mellon,
but local health ofﬁcials say Pitt
students shouldn’t fret yet.

But that doesn’t mean Pitt isn’t
preparing for the worst.

There are 26 potential cases at '

Carnegie Mellon alone, but Guiller-
mo Cole, a spokesman for the Al-
legheny County Health Depart-
ment, said, “Right now, it doesn’t
appear that the H1N1 [more com-
monly known as swine ﬂu] willbe

more severe than a regular ﬂu.”

Cole said the symptoms for the _

swine ﬂu are virtually the same as
those for the regular seasonal ﬂu.

- They include a fever, sore, throat,

cough, headache, muscle aches,
runny nose, fatigue, weakness and,
in some severe cases, intestinal
illness.

So what separates swine ﬂu

from the seasonal ﬂu?

“Expect to see people getting it
disproportionately,” Cole said.

He said people 65 and older
tend not to be as susceptible to
the swine ﬂu as people younger
than age 30 or 40. Somewhere be-
tween 30 and 50 years ago, he said,

akland residents are
talking trash. '
“We need daily
maintenance,” Carlino
Giampolo, founder of the South
Oakland Urban Litter program,
said. “We’re talking abouta tough
consciousness that has existed
for 12 years.  You’re not going
to crack it with once—a—month,
twice-a—month or once—a-week
[trash pi-ck—ups] .” ,
Many people who live, work or
go to school in Oakland agree that
the area has a litter problem. ,
But people who are trying to
help the situation often disagree
on how long—time residents, stu-
dents and Pitt should handle the
trash that laces Oakland’s street
sidewalks and lawns. '
Kelly Wawrzeniak, a commu-

1 nity organizer for the Oakland

Planning and Development Cor-
poration and a Pitt alumna, said

' she believes Oakland has become

noticeably cleaner since she was
a freshman at Pitt in 2002, but
there’s still a lot of work ahead.
The corporation focuses on beau-
tifying Oakland so that people will
take pride in the area.

“The better the neighborhood

Tyler Hein was one of 450 young
women lined up in the Cathedral.
Like many of the others, she
didn’t know what to expect. A fresh-
man, Hein had gotten an invitation
to Lantern Night in the mail. Every-
one in her dorms asked each other

if they were going.

Hein decided to go. She joined
her fellow students for the ceremony
in the packed Heinz Chapel.

Lantern Night began in 1920 as
a ceremony celebrating the history
and legacy of women at Pitt. First-
time female students at the Univer-
sity receive lantems, which are lit
by alumni parents and mentors, and
walk in a processional from Heinz

Chapel to the Cathedral of Learn-
ing.

Now, the ceremony is an im-
portant tradition that’s growing in
popularity at the University.‘

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg,
Dean of Students Kathy Humphrey
and other administrators attended,
while women’s basketball coach Ag-
nus Berenato spoke to the students-
about the symbolism of the lanterns
and the special role of women at
Pitt. - V ‘

“As women, we have to realize the

great challenge before us,” said Ber- -

enato. “Ladies, this light comes with
responsibility and accountability.”
Berenato said she never heard of

Pittwhen she was in high school, and V

she couldn’t afford to go to college.
It was before Title IX had passed.
But she was offered a chance to play
basketball in France, and she began
to followapath to coaching and per-
sonal success.

She said came to Lantern Night
six years ago, when she ﬁrst started
coaching at Pitt. It soon became her
favorite University tradition.

Berenato encouraged women
to pursue their passions and get in—
volved at school.

“You have to make [your light]
shine,” she said. ‘

Chelsea Austen, afreshman, said
the ceremony was meaningﬁil and
made her feel better about starting
her ﬁrst week of college classes.

“It made me feel less nervous and
more content,” Austen said.

‘ For Hein, it served as a remind-
er. ? ‘

“It reminds us that it wasn’t al-
ways easy to do this,” she said. “I
feel like I should take advantage of

the opportunity.”

Pitt’s Student Government Board is
constitutionally required to meet at
least once during the sum'mer.

It met yesterday, in a public
meeting that lasted four minutes.
Theboa1dmetat1J;o1p.m. andwas_ad—
joumedat11:05.BoardPresidentKevin
Morrisonpresided, buttwo ofthe eight
board members were absent.

Despite the brevity of the meet-
ing, Morrison was not displeased.
“It’s hard to do things over the
summer,” Morrison said. ‘‘We’ll
get our work done in the fall.”
Morrisonwas similarlynotconcerned
with the fact that Nila Devanath and
AndrewFreemanmissedthe meeting.
“Board members have jobs, some are
not even back in the city, one is taking
an intensive LSAT class,” Morrison
said. “It’s notabig deal.”

Morrison said that the board is
required by its constitntzion to have a
meeting during the summer. He said
he accomplished things for the board
during the summer but that he would

wait until the next meeting to make ‘

this information public, when more
people attended.

Amongthe material covered, board
member Katlyn Jennings prepared
ﬂiers for the Student Activities Fair,

, held yesterday afternoon. The ﬂiers
contained information on politics in
Pittsburgh and housinginthe Oakland
area.Therewere no committee reports
or new business to be discussed.

One board member, Lance Bon-
ner, made a public armouncement.
“I’m really excited about what the
Student Government Board is going
to accomplish this semester,” Bonner
said. “I’m happy to be here.”

Students’ trash contributes toresidents’ exodus

land ﬁxture since 1980, submitted
a Green Up request -— a request
for help cleaning the area — to
Mayor Luke Ravenstahl so the or-
ganization would have the funds
to renovate three lots in Oakland
where people commonly toss their
trash.

The group is targeting a steep
lot at the intersection of North
Craig and Bates streets for litter,
but Wawrzeniak said she hopes
cleaning the area and planting
trees and shrubs will make people
think twice about littering. ’

A playground at the intersec-
tion of Lawn and Ophelia streets,
as well as a lot located where Bates
Street and Boulevard of the Al-
lies meet, are also priority areas,
she said.

The organization also directly
works to alleviate the litter prob-
lem. A

In 2003, OPDC started the
“Keep It Clean, Oakland!” cam-
paign, and since then, more than
12,000 volunteers have picked

up 5,500—plus bags of trash and

debris, Wawrzeniak said.

“Keep It Clean, Oakland!”
draws volunteers and support
from Oakland residents and stu-

dents, while the Adopt-A-Block .

program targets mostly stu-
dents.

There are 37 groups — most of
them fraternities, sororities and
clubs — that help pick up trash on

because students, not long—time
residents, occupy most of the

Atwood Street and Meyran Av-
enue. He said he established South
Oakland Urban Litter, two years
ago to help reinstitute decorum

“We’re all here for a short time
and deserve to live in dignity,” Gi-
ampolo said.

In 1950, 8,452 people lived in
Central Oakland, and the number

has been declining since. There
were 5,281 residents in Central
Oakland in 2000, according to
Pittsburgh’s 2000 census re-
port.

Oakland, as well, where 29.8 per-
cent of residents are 15 to 19 and
34.8 percent of the population is
20 to 24. Individuals older than
60 comprise 15.7 percent of the
population. .

Gino De Iuliis, the proprietor
of New Oakland Tailor on Meyran
Avenue, remembers what Oakland
was like in 1956 when he opened
his shop.

“It was a lot calmer and a lot
cleaner because there were 50
percent or more people from [It-
aly],” he said. “They took care of
their own properties. There were
no couches on porches.”

But as Pitt expanded, particu-
larly in the -last ﬁve to six years,
the trash problem worsened, De
Iuliis said.

Giampolo said he thinks the
University should take ﬁnancial

responsibility for property dam-

age caused by students.

actions and the consequences
of your actions,” he said. “They

Trash 4 4

munity. The University won’t deal with the
students it brought into our neighbor-
hood.” '

Though he said he won’t blame anyone
for the trash problem, Giampolo wants Pitt
and UPMC to pay for a daily maintenance
program.

SOUL asked the University for $30,000
to pay youth $10 per hour to pick up trash,
but the group was denied. According to the
SOUL website, the University has not con-
tributed any money to OPDC, the Oakland

Community Council, Peoples Oakland and

Community Human Services.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele said the
website’s statement is misleading.

“Some of these organizations have re-
fused funding from the University because
receiving such funding would reduce their
independence and could compromise their
ability to take community positions on is-
sues that may not be consistent with the
position of the University,” he said.

UPMC spokesman Frank Raczkiewicz
said UPMC has donated cleaning supplies

twice per year to OPDC for the past ﬁve V

years.

Wawrzeniak said UPMC donates gloves
and trash bags for the KICO
cleaning days.

But the organization
doesn’t receive funding from
the University, she said, add-
ing that OPDC is a grassroots
operation. Pitt and its neigh-
boring colleges will occasion-
ally donate money and sup-
plies for individual projects,
though.

OPDC arranges for an extra

 

 

The magnets also have a calendar that
highlights which days recyclables are col-
lected and what items can be recycled.

Wawrzeniak said rental property owners
have to educate their tenants about trash
collection and keeping the properties tidy.
OPDC, gives rental property owners the
magnets to distribute to tenants. A

But Giampolo said trash remains on
lawns because people lack respect, not
education.

“The trash and litter are symbblic,” Gi-

ampolo said, adding that when the Univer- S
sity acknowledges the problem and cleans‘

up the streets, the community can move on
to focus on other problems in Oakland.
Wawrzeniak applauded Ravenstahl and
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg for improv-
ing litter conditions in Oakland with their

neighborhood walk-throughs and by en- .

forcing building codes. She said it’s the
landlords’ responsibility to maintain clean
apartments that are up—to-code.

“When students rent a nice apartment,
they are going to respect it. If it lboks like a
dump, they’re going to treat it like a dump,”
she said. ' T

Ravenstahl also spent more than

seven Dumpsters in Central
and South Oakland every year
during the move-in and move—out seasons
for college students. Before the corpora-
tion started putting Dumpsters at stra-
tegic locations, many people just threw
their unwanted possessions on thestreet,
Wawrzeniak said.

“Trash would lie onthe street for weeks,”
she said. “The city couldn’t handle it.”

De Iuliis said he thinks the University
and the city should push landlords to check

” on their tenants and make sure they’re tak-
ing care of their property. He said he’s seen
a table covered in plastic cups sit on a front
lawn for days after a night of partying.

A lot of the work, Wawrzeniak added,
lies in educating students, because a lot of
them are living without parental supervi-
sion for the ﬁrst time in their lives.

At Pitt’s ﬁrst Make A Difference Day last
October, OPDC handed out “Oakland Trash
Talk”. magnets that explained when the city
collects trash in Oakland and that residents
should bring their trash out to the curb after

i 7 the night before collection day.

$250,000 for 250 trash cans placed
throughout the city so that people will be
more inclined to properly dispose of their
trash. Oakland received 13 new trash cans
— more than any other Pittsburgh neigh-
borhood, Wawrzeniak said.

Giampolo said he wants to see the resi-' V

dential streets as clean as Forbes and Fifth
avenues.

_ Property owners in the businessdistrict
on the main streets between Craft Avenue
and Bigelow Boulevard pay a yearly tax of
.0035 percent of their property assessment
value to the Oakland Business Improvement
District. This pays for a daily street clean-
ing service, graffiti removal and sidewalk
salting in the winter.

De Iuliis said he believes this service.

is very important, considering Pitt’s and
UPMC’s international visitors.

But Pitt’s Off-Campus Living website
doesn’t address issues about how to be a
respectful neighbor. The University encour-
ages green practices in other ways.

Volunteers won’t clean yards

Trash 4 6

When Pitt students organized
Pitt Make A Difference Day for
the ﬁrst time last year, 364 people
showed up for Pitt’s 14th annual
Pitt Project Oakland cleanup spon-
sored by the University’s Student
Volunteer Outreach ofﬁce.

Giampolo said he believes
these sorts of efforts are “only
half-hearted,” adding that SOUL
never disparages anyone.

But he said he doesn’t think
the efforts of OPDC, other non-
proﬁt organizations and Pitt are
enough.

Since March 13, 2007, SOUL
has been writing letters to UPMC
and Pitt administrators, the may-
or and local newspapers, accord-
ing to its website.

The organization has also pur-
chased 11 advertisements in four
newspapers: The Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette, The Pitt News, The Uni-
versity Times and The Tartan.

Wawrzeniak said she would
appreciate more support from
the University because OPDC is a
volunteer-based organization that
relies on grants and donations.

The organization works with

the University and other orga-
nizations to develop new green
projects. KICO helps to maintain a
garden on Lawn Street in Oakland
and paints walls to make them less
attractive to vandals.

Wawrzeniak said she is also
excited about incorporating re-
cycling into the program’s trash
pick-ups. Before this initiative,
volunteers would just throw bot-
tles and cans in with the nonre-
cyclable trash.

There’s only so much they can
do, she said. Legally, volunteers
cannot pick up litter in people’s
yards and rummage through bush-
es. This is why she believes that
creating a better image of Oakland
would prevent passers—by from
littering in the ﬁrst place.

Wawrzeniak remembers what
it’s like being a student away from
home for the ﬁrst time, but she
encourages the students to be
respectful of the neighborhood
and its residents.

“Oakland isn’t just a place for
[students] to hang out for four
years, destroy and leave,” she
said.

Pitt prepares for worst—ca.se H1N1 scenario

Swine ﬂu < 1

senior citizens were exposed to a
strain of the ﬂu that was similar
to H1N1 and therefore have some
resistance to it.

Younger people, he added,
“don’t have any protection 
You’ve never been exposed to any
virus like this because there hasn’t
been any virus like this.”

Jay Frerotte, Pitt’s director of
environmental health and safety,
said students should self-isolate if
they begin to have ﬂu-like symp-
toms. This means skipping class
and social events to stay either in
their dorm rooms or apartments
or heading home, if possible. Stu-
dents with ﬂu—like symptoms can
leave to get necessities, Frerotte
said.

He suggested that students call
their doctors before going in for an
appointment. Their doctors will
tell them what steps they can take
to avoid passing a potential case of
the swine ﬂu on to other people,
he said.

Both Frerotte and Cole said
that not everyone who exhibits
ﬂu-like symptoms will be tested
for swine ﬂu. They said officials

tend to test for swine ﬂu to see
if it has arrived in an area. After
health professionals know that the
swine ﬂu has entered Allegheny
County, for example, they likely
will not test every person with ﬂu-
like symptoms. They’ll simply go
ahead and treat them.

Combine that with the fact that
not everyone
who has ﬂu-like
symptoms will
see a doctor, and
it’s possible that
authorities will
never know ex-
actly how many
swine ﬂu cases
will appear in

 

  

mouths and noses if they must do
so.

Both Cole and Frerotte said they
expect a swine ﬂu vaccine to be
available by mid-October. Because
college students are among those
most vulnerable to the H1N1 virus,
they will be some of the ﬁrst people
to get the shots. Young children,

ic, should it get worse, Frerotte
said.

He said Pitt staff members rep-
resenting the provost’s and dean’s
offices, Student Health Services
and the Department of Environ-
mental Health and Safety, among

other groups, have been meeting ~

routinely to develop a broad set of
criteria that will
determine how

the University 4

would react to a

 There’s not a single  magic factor that
says if we get to Point X, we will suspend

classes.

large-scale out-
break.

“There’s not
a single ...magic .
factor that says

Jay Frerotte if we get to Point

t h e U nit e d
States.

Still, Frerotte said, “I don’t
think anyone should be panick-
ing. It’s all common sense of how
to protect yourself.”

He suggested students wash
their hands regularly and avoid
touching their mouths and noses.
Cole said people should refrain
from coughing or sneezing in pub-
lic and should be sure to cover their

pregnant women and people with
conditions that put them at high
risk, such as asthma, will also be
among the ﬁrst to receive the vac-
cine.

Preparing for the worst

The University has been work-
ing since May to develop ways to
cope with the swine ﬂu pandem-

X, we will sus-
pend classes,”
he said. ‘.‘There are a number of
considerations to be taken into‘
account.” T _
Frerotte said University admin-
istrators will evaluate the severity
of swine ﬂu symptoms, number
of cases, people’s reactions and
suggestions from local, state and
national health organizations.
He said he thought the task *

force would also make a recom-
mendation to University admin-
istrators.

Carnegie Mellon copes

Teresa Thomas, a spokes-
woman for Carnegie Mellon, said
in an e-mail that she wasn’t sure

whether the 26 students with ﬂu— F
- like symptoms had the swine ﬂu or

the seasonal ﬂu.

The students had mild to mod-
erate symptoms, she said, and a
few were expected to be discharged
from health facilities late last
week. ’

Carnegie Mellon sent an e-mail
to its faculty and staff last week
saying that students with ﬂu-like
symptoms were being isolated in
accordance with the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention
recommendations.

The school asked students with
ﬂu-like symptoms to’ stay home
and avoid contact with others.

i Staff members in the university’s

student health services, housing,
dining and student affairs ofﬁces
were taking care of sick students
living in the dorms.

Editorial

G-20: Guns and
hot tempers a  
bad combination

long with bringing an
Aesteemed collection of
world leaders, the G-20

Summit meetings consistently at-
tract large crowds of protesters.

To keep things under control, the -

Pittsburgh Police and Secret Ser-
vice have been preparing for weeks
— there will even be an inﬂux of
1,000 Pennsylvania state police
officers for added manpower. But
the city is looking toward more
than just manpower.

Under a proposed city of Pitts-
burgh ordinance, protesters would
face restrictions on carrying an
assault weapon during the G-20

protests, according to an article in '

the Pittsburgh Post—Gazette.

A clause in the ordinance says
that no one is allowed to posses a
variety of items , including 37 types
of ﬁrearms and even rotten eggs, if
it looks like they are attempting to
disturb police crowd dispersal ef-
forts. As notably demonstrated at
a recent President Obama protest
in Arizona, citizens have the right
to openly bear arms, provided the
have a permit. ‘

Legislators say this proposal
has nothing against possessing
guns. Supporters say they just hope
gun owners leave them at home.

It’s not difficult to understand
the rationale behind this proposal.
G-20 protests don’t possess an
immaculate record as far as vio-
lence. For example, 122 individuals
were arrested following clashes
with police forces at the London
G-20 meeting in April. Gun—toting
protesters could potentially wreck
lethal damage.

Any type of gun, no matter its

caliber or ﬁrepower, can obviously
be deadly in the wrong hands.

Yet, as the ordinance targets
assault weapons, there’s all the
more reason to put it into effect.
High-power semi—automatic riﬂes
— examples of automatic weapons
—— have no place at such demon-
strations. Even if self—defense is a
priority, why do protesters need
such ﬁrepower?

Of course, it’s true that the ma-
jority of gun—carrying protesters
don’t intend to use their weapons,
and many carry ﬁrearms to pro-
vide self—defense or to be used as
a mark of intimidation.

But when it comes down to it,
hot tempers and assault weapons
never seem like a very safe or sound
combination. And if protesters re-
ally want their point heard, acts
of violence will only overshadow
their message of reform.

The G-20 Summit consistently
attracts swarms of protesters, and
this tradition of sorts doesn’t ap-
pear to be going away. As long as
the protesting persists, we should
keep the potential damage to a
minimum.

Right to arms advocates believe
the G—20 protests serve as an im-
petus to tighten gun control. As

the ordinance doesn’t include an \.

expiration date, it could still be in
effect even after G-20 concludes.

Perhaps this is an example of
hasty legislation, and there’s sure
to be even more discontent from
gun rights groups. But the propo-
nents of the ordinance still uphold
auspicious reasoning.

ﬂoor and the insect residents who
aren’t paying rent to live there.

What’s even cooler is that iBurgh
will automatically link the picture
you send to a map so city workers
will know where your problems lie.
There’s no need to text message an
address with the photo.

The concept is genius, simply
genius.

Long have I believed that Pitts-
burgh’s government is far too cum-
bersome for its own good. Between
the city and Allegheny County, there
are departments upon departments
that seem to overlap one another
in what they do. Knowing who to
call and when to call can be over-
whelming.

And if there is ever a need to go
to a city council meeting, good luck.
They’re all on weekday mornings,
so priorities shift as to whether it’s
really worth it to skip class and fend
off Downtown traffic simply to tell
the council about the cop who just
blew through a stop sign.

It makes iBurgh seem like a
wonderful idea, but I question its
real—world value. When it catches
on, I imagine the city hotline might
become overwhelmed with inqui-

ries.

Will the same number of opera-
tors already responding to 311 be
burdened with even more phone
trafﬁc? I called the line to ask them
myself, and I found out they’re only
open weekdays for a little more than
eight hours per day. They’ll have
their work cut out for them to get
it all running smoothly.

There’s also reason to be con-
cerned with what’s actually handled
by the city. If I had an iPhone, I’d
take pictures of the panhandlers
who are starting to migrate into
South Oakland from Forbes Avenue
and send that to the city.

If the iBurgh system runs on a
ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-served basis, I won-
der what kind of sane person would
handle my triﬂing complaints over,
say, a water main break. There has
to be some relevant and fair way to
sort priority. I hope the city workers
will know the difference.

But then again, if I were com-
plaining about the same daring do-
nation-taker standing on the private
property in front of my apartment

Society ﬁnds problems, blames them on‘villains’

Is Alan Greenspan the devil? Clearly.

 
   

Mason Herron
Columnist

We are hesitant to admit it, but
we need our villains — our dragons
to slay, our bandits to bust, our ty-
rants to topple. This need is merely
commensurate with our desire to
become society’s shining knights.
To a certain degree, we all long to
be heroes. It’s part of our nature to
desire recognition, and for many,
that recognition must come as be-
ing the conqueror over evil.

Within our society, villains are
rarely present, but we still seek
them out, often in the form of pes-
tering neighbors or unruly fans of
opposing sports teams.

Politicians, however, know best
how to create, seek out and attempt
to destroy the demons of society.
They’ve become magniﬁcently
skilled at the art of crafting the ne-
farious beings that they can blame
for the ills of the United States.

So it is no surprise that, over
the past few years, great effort has

been exerted toward portraying
the unfortunate problems that
have plagued us as caused by greed
or malice. Take, for example, the
congressional inquiries into ris-
ing oil prices during the summer
of 2008.

Unwilling to believe that gas
prices were determined by supply
and demand in an industry where
demand is never a sure thing, nu-
merous members of Congress be-
gan blaming the “oil speculators”
who were, inexplicably, driving up
prices simply to make money.

These speculators were never
named or identiﬁed, of course.
However, based on their carica-
tures, it wouldn’t have been the
least bit surprising if, had they been
revealed, they would have been
wearing a cape, goatee, monocle
and whatever other evil apparel the
imagination can conjure.

But then, oil prices returned to
tolerable levels once the summer
ended, and the issue receded. Do
stay tuned for the sequel, which
will undoubtedly appear once oil
prices rise again.

Nonetheless, as one issue fades,
another must rise. So we turned to
the ﬁnancial crisis. Economists are
still trying to understand its causes,

— and distinguished debate in that

dismal ﬁeld continues.

However, Congress and the
White House found the cause
months ago: greed, greedy CEOs,
greedy companies and generally
slimy businesses that took advan-
tage of the non-greedy.

Some want to see these people in
jail. In the article “Hundreds should
go to jail,” Tom Gardner, ‘co-founder
and CEO of The Motley Fool, said,
“We won’t see orange jumpsuits on
the hundreds of bankers forwhom
they would ﬁt ... the banking sec-
tor has wiped out its investors, is
decimating companies that rely on
credit, and is primarily responsible
for our rising unemploymen .”

What many have been unwill-
ing or unable to understand is that
this crisis was brought on by what
Alan Greenspan characterized as
“irrational exuberance,” a collec-
tive misunderstanding of how much
houses were worth and how much

risk companies were taking.

_ To see that this was the case,
one merely has to look at how this
sort of misunderstanding occurred
on all levels. CEOs were guilty of it,
mortgage companies were guilty
of it, insurers were guilty of it, and
home buyers who bought multiple
houses on credit were guilty of it.

Sending people tojail forfailing
is hardly the right message to send
to a nation that was founded as a re-
sult of what was essentially a large
risk, and that sense of risk-taking
is what has propelled the sort of
prominence among the world that
we enjoy today.

Our country has done so well in ’

the past, has overcome numerous
obstacles and has become such a
beacon of success that it becomes
difficult to understand the heart-
beats of fallibility that we often
face.

When a problem arises that we
aren’t used to —- such as the sort
of pervas ive failure that caused the
current recession — our reﬂex is to
conclude that it wasn’t our collective
fault, but must have been the result

of the sort of evil reserved only for
comic books and the.Bible.

Turning government policy into
a constant battle between good and
evil is never a wise solution.

Much of Latin America’s 20th
century was characterized by a
tendency to constantly ﬁght eco-
nomic ‘battles against inequality,
against wealth, against markets.
The result has been an unfortunate
lack of prosperity for most of the
region and an enriching lesson that
shows the problems of economic
populism‘.

What the trial and conviction of
Bernie Madoff proved is that there
are genuine instances in which peo-
ple lack a grasp of morality and that
their pursuit of self-interest comes
atgreat cost to others. Madoff’s be-
havior destroyed wealth and trust
and is genuinely something our
government must ﬁght against.

However, we must not assume
that every banker is a potential Ma-
doff and that every problem within
our society is caused by Dr. Evil.

While it lacks the catchy name of our
local software, I’m sure all eyes will
be on us ﬁrst to see how the idea
works in practice.

If it succeeds, iBurgh will be-
come a model for iPhone software
in other metropolitan areas, bring-
ing kvetching into the 21st century.
And if it doesn’t, it will be the ﬁrst
time I’ve ever heard of a bunch of
CMU students failing at anything.
That sort of thingjust doesn’t hap-

of usual

A pen.

I believe that the biggest rea-
son why participatory government
doesn’t always work well is that it’s
just too impractical. Showing up
places, registering, waiting in lines
and needing to have some sem-
blance of sociability -— who wants
to do that?

If I call the city hotline, chances
are I’m going to have to hold back
from unleashing my frustration on

an operator who doesn’t deserve it
after waiting on hold for 15 minutes.
iBurgh bypasses traditional, old-
fashioned reckless venting.

Ideally, iBurgh will ﬁise practi-
cality with a nagging sense of Puri-
tanical tattling on local issues that
will create a more efficient public
works program.

Whether it lives up to that po-

tential has yet to be seen. Word has ~

to spread about its beneﬁts, and it

city bureaucracy

has to be implemented as a serious

tool —— not just a device to drunk S

text when boredom ensues.

It has all the makings of being
the game—changer this city needs to
bring a voice back to the people. All
it really needs now is an infrastruc-
ture to handle it and a download
from iPhone users who want the
city to be ﬁxed up. .

Will it be ashocking cinematic end to summer?

“Halloween 2” revels in dead teens, soon to be dead franchise

Courtesy Marsha LaMarc/ Dimension Films

Michael Meyers (Tyler Mane) tortures poor Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor—Compton),

Kieran Layton
A&E Editor

The only thing worse than a pointless remake O

is a pointlesssequel to a pointless remake.

And Rob Zombie has committed both of
these cinematic atrocities in the past three
years, comprising half of his full-length‘ di-
rectorial career — not such a good track
record. v .
While  might be a curse of remakes that
plagues the gothérock legend, Zombie might
also want to avoid the Halloween holiday,
because “Halloween 2” amounts to nothing
more than an uneven, poorly—paced and un-
scaryentry into not only the slasher genre,
but in the “Halloween” legacy.

Opening with a scene of young Michael
Meyers with his mother, Deborah, in the
Sanitarium from the previous movie, the ﬁlm
immediately establishes a running theme of
pop—psychology involving a white horse that
never comes to fruition throughout the run-
ning time, no matter how much of it Zombie
throws in the audience’s face.

After that, the ﬁlm picks up supposedly
where it left off in the ﬁrst ﬁlm: Laurie Strode
(Scout Taylor—Compton) is wandering the
streets of Haddonﬁeld, Ill., after “killing”
her brother Michael. Needless to say, Mi-

much to the boredom of the audience.

chael Meyers can’t be dead — who would
brutally massacre all of the less-than—one-
dimensional characters strewn throughout
the sequel? _ ‘

Without creating even the smallest
amount of tension and heading straight
for the violence in an overly long dream
sequence, the ﬁlm then ﬂashes forward a
year later, where the ever—hysterical Laurie
is still coping with the traumatic events of
the previous Halloween. Though she believes
Michael is dead — or does she?. —- we as
audience members know better and fully
understand his machetewill get a workout‘
by the end of the ﬁlm.

Also, Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) is
releasing a book on Michael Meyers timed
— surprise, surprise —— with Halloween,
and while McDowell does what he can with
the one~note character (that note being an
a**hole), there is never any motivation to
care about his turmoil other than to ponder
if he will eventually be killed off.

There are various other characters,
mostly new friends of Laurie’s, but the only
one worth noting might be Annie (Danielle
Harris) from the previous ﬁlm. In what might
be the most garish display of cinematic nepo-
tism in recent memory, Sheri Moon Zombie
— the director’s wife — is given a ludicrous
amount of screen time for a character that

A mediocre trip to “The Final Destination”

Kieran Layton
A&E Editor

Death must be getting tired, or at least
annoyed with feeling compelled to de-
vise elaborate schemes to creatively off
movie characters for the delight of the
audience.

Judging by the death scenes in the
fourth entry to the “Final Destination” se-
ries, either the Grim.Reaper or the writers
— or both —— have run out of motivation to
kill characters off creatively, consequently
leaving the new and hopefully ﬁnal ﬁlm —a
mediocre albeit bloody trip.

For those who somehow aren’t familiar
with the surprisingly successful franchise,
the “Final Destination” ﬁlms all revolve
around a group of people saved from a
horrible disaster by some teenager’s
premonition, who are then picked off by
Death because they supposedly cheated
him and “his plan.” Believe it or not, this
idea was once considered innovative and
fresh when the ﬁrst ﬁlm came out.

Over the years, however, the tone has
progressed from creepily quirky (“Final
Destination”) to overly serious and mor-
bid (“Final Destination 2”) to sadistically
campy and humorous (“Final Destination

the mall.

3”). With the newest installment, the tone
has become so marginalizedand the prem-
ise and execution so formulaic that there
is little here to keep audiences interested,
let alone scared.

Oh wait, there’s the addition of 3-D.

In an effort to gloss over the glaring
shortcomings in writing, acting and origi-
nality, the ﬁlmmakers have added the glo-
rious ability to watch blood and various

. organs pop out at you from the screen.

Unfortunately, this is only a mild diversion
before it grows tiresome and occasionally
distracting.

The story — or set—up for the death
scenes —— revolves around Nick (Bobby
Campo) rescuing his friends and other

random strangers from disaster at a NA—-

SCAR—esque stock car race. The opening
scene, which usually sets the tone for the
rest of the movie, is amusing enough, but
it doesn’t hold a candle to the openers
in the previous series entries. Expecting
something akin to the horrifying freeway
pile—up in the second ﬁlm? Though the two
movies share the same director (David R.
Ellis), the race track catastrophe pales in
comparison. .

One thing Ellis is acutely aware of is
the true drawing power of such ﬁlms: the

death scenes. He wastes little time on mi— .

Levinson: ‘Avatar Day’ a fail

A publicity stunt for James Cameron’s latest epic leaves Noah cold

Courtesy 20th Century Fox

Two military men from “Avatar” go through line after line of boring dialogue.

Noah Levinson
Contributing Editor

Am I too hard on 3-D‘? I go in to every extra-
dimensional ﬁlm with a furrowed brow. I ask
myself, “Why do we need 3-D? Are we really
that bored with cinema? Instead of paying
for expensive 3-D movie tickets, why not just
save up and go to Disney World and enjoy
it in a setting where it belongs?”

But when I hear that something will
(might?) revolutionize the entire movie
industry —— and I hear James Cameron’s
name paired with 3-D — I can’t reserve my
piqued interest.

Two Fridays ago, director James Cam-
eron and 20th Century Fox held a special
15-minute preview at select theaters of their
new ﬁlm, “Avatar,” in glorious 3-D. They
dubbed the event “Avatar Day,” a mildly
creative advertising scheme. I only wish
they had a “Doubt Day” last winter. ‘

The theater had a queue roped off for
the expected throngs of ﬁlm blog follow-
ers, the only people who really knew about
Avatar Day.

But when I got to the door, only a few
cinemaphiles accompanied me in.

After receiving what appeared to be ski
goggles for the 3-D, I had a decent idea of
what people were expecting.

Most of the audience had known about
“Avatar” practically for years and were
ready to love it like mothers love a ﬁrst—born
child. There were, however, a few cy'nics in

the back, myself included, waiting to scru-
pulously analyze every detail and pounce
upon the slightest of ﬂaws.

As the seats eventually ﬁlled with strag-
glers looking for something to do, the IMAX
projectors slid open with a crisp electronic
efficiency that only today’s digital world
could appreciate. ,

But before I go into the dirty details, let
it be known that there willbe a ‘few plot
descriptions —— not enough for a spoiler
alert, so nothing that will make you mad
at me.

‘ Scene one: A tall military man is talking
to military-like men. Some “won’t come
back alive” kind of discussion occurs. I

yawn. A man in a wheelchair — the main T

character -— tries to get to his seat.

The story is as interesting to me as .a
Braille textbook.

3-D—wise, it’s all live action, so the only
thing I notice is depth and a brighter image.
It’s going to take more than that to make me
soil my pants in amazement.

Scene two: To work on the strange
planet, the men have to put their brains
(electronically) into a clone of one of the
native creatures, the Na’vi, that they can
control.

This is what an “avatar” is in the ﬁ1m’s
universe. The paraplegic steps into the ma-
chine and his brain is transferred. He stands
up in his avatar, and the doctors tell him
to sit down. He doesn’t. Chaotic, innocent
horseplay ensues.

Everything here is just bad. The acting ,

is bad, the music is bad and the dialogue is
sh*tty. It makes me wonder how Cameron
can be in the editing room, watch this and
say, “Good job.”

But it’s only one scene, so perhaps I judge
out of context.

The only bit I’m actually excited about is
the computer—generated creatures — whop-
ping 8 or 9 feet tall, lean and completely blue
humanoid beings with long hair and tails.

Scene three: I almost soiled myself. It’s
a chase scene with bigldinosaur—looking
creatures and really big rat creatures. It’s
primal, ﬁlled with fast camera motions, a lot
of teeth and screaming. No blood, though
—— I’m still waiting on 3-D blood.

Scene four: It’s another chase scene, but

- now with wolf things in the dark. All of the

3-D is starting to give me a headache. A
native of the planet jumps out and kills the
wolf things, thereby saving the hero. Now
he follows her and probably wants to kiss
her. a l g .

This [plot isn’t original — it’s been done
a billion times. A man meets a woman of

a society he doesn’t understand. Then, he ‘

realizes that his society is cruel and heart-

less, and then he lives with the woman. Has

Cameron never seen “Pocahontas?” '
Scene 5: The hero is now a native and

is trying to control a pterodactyl creature
with his ponytail.

At this point, my 3-D headache is raging,
and I can’t take it anymore. The Na’vi stick
their ponytail into the ear of the pterodactyl
thing to control them. It’s gooey, gross and
certainly notcool in 3-D.

The sneak peek ends with a run of various
clips from the trailer, and I leave the theater
with a nasty 3-D hangover. ,

So the ﬁnal word:-The 3-D really was
underwhelming, except for one short clip‘
that showed the beauty of underwater lights
rendered in 3-D (reminiscent of the beau-
tiful “Coraline in 3-D”). But even that will
eventually lose its novel luster.

Maybe if Cameron had concentrated a

little more on plot, then I would be kinder.

But you can’t get away with some of the
lines in this movie. They’re just too cliché.
I’ll bet the movie will end with a kissand a
tree singing “Colors of the Wind.”

Then again, maybe it’s just because I
never really liked Cameron’s storytelling. In
“Titanic,’? there was deﬁnitely enough room
on the ﬂoating door for Rose andjack. And
maybe even a freaky‘ pterodactyl beast.

Cast and crew talk death

“The Final Destination” team discusses shooting a deadly ﬁlm

Courtesy New Line Cinema

Haley Webb and Nick Zano look up at something that will inevitably cause their

Kieran Layton
A&E Editor

. When an actor is shooting a movie about

death, it’s hard not to constantly imagine
different ways to die on set.

“When you’re shooting and thinking
about death every day, there’s always mouse-
trap—type things that make you think, “If
the back of the truck fell and hit that, that
would shoot up to the power line and I’d
get electrocuted and die,” actress Shantel
VanSanten said.

If what she is describing sounds suspi-
ciously like a scene in a “Final Destination”
movie, that’s because it is. Vansanten re-
cently discussed her new ﬁlm, “The Final
Destination,” which is the fourth installment
in the successful horror franchise.

“The Final Destination” is being touted
as the last entry in the series, and while
advertisements claim “Death saved the best
for last,” it is also notable that this is the ﬁrst
entry to use 3-D technology to ensure every
blood splatter, rogue tire and roaring ﬂame
is experienced by the audience. ‘

David Ellis, director of this and the sec-
ond ﬁlm, talked about the challenges that
accompany production on a 3-D ﬁlm;

demise.

T “There’s a lot more going on. There’s a lot
more involving setting up for the day to get
your shots. You have to think the cameras
are a lot heavier, so you need‘ some pretty
big guys,” Ellis said. a

He said that where a normal camera
would require anywhere from one to four
people, the cameras used for production
on this ﬁlm usually required eight to nine
people.

Also, Ellis joked that their ﬁlm was a
guinea pig for the James Cameron-created

3-D cameras used for his upcoming epic,

“Avatar.” He went on to say that using 3-D
is about more than creating cooler special
effects.

“We were one of the ﬁrst full—length live
3-D movies being made. The most exciting
things are not in—your—face stuff — if we

were doing a scene just here in this room, '

that scene would have so much more depth
than if we were doing it in 2-D. I, as an audi-
ence member, would feel like I was part of
the conversation.-

“For me, it’s all about throwing stuff in
the kidsifaces, scaring them and making
them duck and all that. The reason I took this
ﬁlm was to learn —— not only to keep working
and make some money and work with New
Line again ¥—’ but most importantly was to

understand 3-D technology,” he said.

Craig Perry, producer for all four “Final
Destination” ﬁlms, talked about taking on
the task of keeping the elaborate death scene
premise fresh, and making the ﬁnal ﬁlm
the best yet. .

“The challenge actually isn’t scope and
size — it’s accessibility. It’s trying to ﬁnd
places you and I might be on a daily basis
and then invest in something malevolent.
As we’ve gone through the movies, it’s been
getting harder and harder,” Perry said.

Audience members care more about the
anticipation of the kill than the actual kill
itself, particularly in the “Final Destination”
franchise, he said. A

Actress Haley Webb said she really enjoys
the concept of the series.

“I love the fact that [the deaths] happens
in an order —— there’s always the question of
‘Can you beat death?”’ Webb said.

“If anything, we’re reacting to this mas-
sive public interest in mortality and the de-
sire to look at and get close to witness things
that are horrible, but be safe enough that
we don’t actually have it happen to us. It’s
this weird human thing — the desire to be
a witness,” Perry said.

Bobby Campo, who plays Nick, the guy

who has the initial premonition of a race-
track disaster in the ﬁlm’s opening, also
discussed the ﬁlm series’ success.

“The appeal to it is that these are every-
day situations. It takes something that really
can happen to you, and that’s the fear that
we’re playing on. This stuff could happen to
anybody at any moment,” Campo said.

Campo and Vansanten agreed that ﬁlm-
ing such a movie can take a lot out of an actor,
both physically and mentally.

“There. was one day where we were
shooting it, and Ijust lost it. You’re in these
scenes where you think, ‘I’m never going to
understand what this feels like because it

just doesn’t happen to that many people.’
As safe as I feel with [director] David Ellis
— he was a Stuntman forever —— there’s still
a part of you that has this raw adrenaline,”
Vansanten said.

Campo said that safety, however, was
always the primary concern. The stunts in
the ﬁlm, which were done by both the ac-
tors and their stunt doubles, coupled with
the technology the ﬁlm uses, will deﬁnitely
attract a big crowd.

“You can’t just spectate in this movie ——
the technology literally draws you in t the
ﬁlm,” Campo said.

Monkey’s newest no Humbug

With a new producer, the Arctic Monkeys’ new CD soars

_ Arctic Monkeys - Humbug cover
Alison Smyth
Staff Writer

Arctic Monkeys — Humbug

Released: Aug. 25

Label: Domino Recordings . ,
Rocks Like: Traditional Arctic Monkeys
meets British Queens of the Stone Age
Grade: A-

Sometimes musical hunches prove to be
right.

After one cold listen to Arctic Monkeys’
Humbug, it becomes abundantly clear which
band was the primary inﬂuence for there-
cord.

It seems an unlikely pairing, but, like
most musical collaborations, the Arctic

    

‘Monkeys as produced byjosh Homme from

Queens of the Stone Age holds true as a
surprising delight.

The Arctic Monkeys usually represent
all that Brit—pop has to offer. That means
quirky anecdotes, peppy, upbeat rhythms
and catchy tunes. But Humbug is far from

. what you’d call perky pop. Instead, the

Queens of the Stone Age’s inﬂuences bring
the band into darker, more moody tones. _

Each track features the heavy guitar,
periodic electric solos and even the vocal
quality that Queens of the Stone Age has
so often utilized. Humbug is still leagues
away from the sometimes-screaming, re-
verberating style of Era Vulgaris. But the
stylistic lines blur on tracks like “Potion
Approaching,” wherejosh Homme actually
sings the backing vocals, or in whisper-sung
beginnings like “Dangerous Animals.”

This is Arctic Monkeys covers Queens of
the Stone Age—style. The songs are colpred by
the electric sounds from the darker side of
the rock spectrum. The Brits aren’t throwing
away their dancing shoes just yet, but they
are starting to mimic their older brother.

The moodier version of Arctic Monkeys
could scare away some of the band’s peppy
fans, but they’ll certainly be replaced by fans
of the Queens’ brand of rock.

The Arctic Monkeys’ quirk is altered,
the catchiness is veiled, but the music is no
less satisfying. '

There is no question why this album is
great. Not to quote Hannah Montana, but
really, it’s the best of both worlds.

Do those upcoming productions of The
Sleeping Beauty ballet or Stomp look entic-
ing to you, though the steep ticket prices
are making you cower behind your not—so-
full wallet? Pitt Arts and the Cheap Seats
program may be the bait to lure you out
of ﬁnancial fear.
' Cheap Seats allows students — as well
as graduate students, faculty and staff —-
to purchase tickets to shows and cultural
events at deep discounts while retaining
independence over their transportation
and dining decisions, unlike-the totally
managed experience offered by the Arts
Encounters program. Eleven arts organiza-
tions participate in the program.

To purchase tickets, students can fill
out a form at the Pitt Arts office on the
ninth floor of the William Pitt Union, buy

Attack of the Cheap Seats.

Attack of the Cheap Seats is not, as one
might initially suspect, a bad sci-ﬁ ﬁlm,
but a 10-day event during which students
can buy tickets from multiple organiza-
tions at once on a single form. The pro-
gram kicks off on Sept. 9 from noon to 2

I p.m. in the WPU assembly room. There

will be booths representing the opera,
Pittsburgh Public Theater, CLO Cabaret,

ballet, cultural trust and symphony.

Often booths bring samples of their
wares, so to speak: opera singers and ballet
dancers. Lunch will also be provided. The
Attack of the Cheap Seats program contin-
ues until Sept. 17, after which students can
continue to purchase Cheap Seats either
outside of the Pitt Arts office or online
through the Pitt Arts website, albeit for
one event at a time.

Meyersa killer bore

New “Halloween” ﬂick plagued by tragic script, bad acting

Halloween 2 4 17

is supposed to be dead.

It’s hard to pinpoint why Zombie fails
so miserably at creating characterization,
tension or even the cheap jump-out scare.
Michael supposedly has some strange psy-
chological obsession with his mother and
his “family” —— which makes for a lackluster
reveal two-thirds of the way through — but
Zombie attempts to pull this tricky slasher

maneuver off with the ﬁnesse of a dump
, truck. ’

By covering his actors and sets in shadows
and oddly ﬁltered lenses, Zombie seems to
think that he is infusing “style” into the ﬁlm,

’ but really, the ﬁlm represents the anti—stylish

slasher ﬂick. It is ugly," drab and poorly lit:
There is no suggestion in the direction that
we are supposed to be scared at any point,
just that we have to endure the brush strokes
of an artist painting with ﬁlth.

This might have been an attempt at real-

ism —- and therefore “true horror” — but .

it is mainly just boring. Don’t be misled —
this is a brutal ﬁlm, and gorehounds might
ﬁnd plenty to love with the repeat stabbings
(complete with the squishy sound effects),
but for everyone else, the blood will only
conjure up a yawn.

With so much emphasis given to Lau-

rie and her psychological trauma, Taylor-
Compton would have to turn in a startlingly
good performance to pull it off, and while
she isn’t awful, the actress spends so much
time looking hysterical that she grows into
a grating character, not one to sympathize
with. Honey, you are no Jamie Lee Curtis
— give it up.

Finally, while a horror movie script could
be allotted a fair amount of leeway as far as
logic, “Halloween 2”" seems to have given
up on the concept entirely. Throughout the
ﬁlm, Michael will just magically appear to
terrorize Laurie and her friends, but there
is nevereven a suggestion as to how he knew
where to ﬁnd her. PSP,'perhaps — Psycho
Sensory Perception?

It’s sad, especially for a devoted follower
of the horror genre, to see such a misguided
attempt at recreating one of the best fran-
chises out there. Zombie obviously has po-
tential to direct something frightening, but
‘he needs to focus on something more in line
with his style. '

And he should probably stay away from
anything holiday related. At least Black
Christmas already received its crappy re-
make.

Death holds few surprises

Death scenes in “The Final Destination” not that shocking

Final Destination 4 17

nor details, like exposition or character
development, and spends as much of the
rapid 75-minute running time on killing
the practically nameless characters off.
He even goes so far as to derive two
pieces of death fodder as nameless enti-
ties, known to other characters only by

their most telling characteristics. This

results in such memorable performances
by Justin Welborn and Krista Allen as “the
Racist Redneck” and “the Hot MILF,” re-
spectively.

When the elaborately imagined set
pieces "occur, however, the ﬁlm rises to
varying levels of mindless entertainment,
at least if that’s your thing. There is some-
thing perversely entertaining about physi-
cally dodging bits of 3-D—splattered gore
thatisplashes out at you or a rogue tire
that appears to have a hit out for your
demise.

With so much focus on these scenes,
though, all the mythology the series has
built up surrounding the specifics of how
to alter death’s plans and the ensuing
consequences goes out the window. The
main character has ridiculously silly CGI-
rendered premonition—like visions that
enable him to see bits and pieces of the

next character’s death, but the audience
will be too busy snickering to take them
seriously.

Taking a hint from the previous entry;._
the fourth ﬁlm understands that the se-
ries’ premise lends itself particularly well
to humor. While this movie elicits just as
many groans and unintentional laughs
as it does intentional ones — are they
unintentional? — it still makes a ﬁlm a lot
more fun that had it taken its ridiculous
scenarios on with a straight face.

Also, the ending, though a touch gim-
micky to presumably lengthen an already
short movie, contains a healthy amount
of meta—awareness that might fool the
unsuspecting audience member that thq,
script is smarter than it really is. Don’t
be fooled — this is no subversive com-
mentary on 3-D ﬁlmmaking or the “death
porn” genre, just a touch of tongue-in- _
cheek amusement.

Ultimately, while it is a sporadically
amusing trip, it is comforting to know that
this is the final destination of the “Final
Destination” series.

Now excuse me, I need to death-proof
my bathroom. My toothbrush is looking
awfully suspicious.

Plenty of cheap tickets through Cheap Seats

Pitt Arts’ program allows ‘students access to cheap tickets for great shows

student’s name at each venue’s Will Call
window. V

Pitt sophomore Paulina Gonzales used
the Cheap Seats program three times last
year. .

“The program was really easy to use,
very straightforward. And I love that the
tickets are waiting for you at Will Call —
it’s really convenient,” Gonzales said.

Of the more than 13,000 tickets sold
last year, Pitt Arts director Annabelle Clip-
pinger said she can count the number of
problems students have had with ticket
pick-ups on four ﬁngers.

Christy Savage,‘ a Pitt sophomore, said
that “sometimes the seats are pretty far
away, but for what you’re paying you really
can’t complain.” -

Clippinger echoed that sentiment, add-
ing that many of the smaller participat-
ing venues “don’t have a bad seat in the
house.”

The deadlines for purchasing tickets

V through Cheap Seats are usually one week

or 10 days prior to the show. Clippinger
recommends buying even sooner, if pos-
sible, because the best availability goes
to the first tickets processed.

The maximum number of tickets stu-
dents can purchase per event variesfrom

V four to eight, though some might be as

few as two.

Students can bring people unaffiliated
with the University as long as the student
buys the tickets and attends the event.

The discount students receive depends a
on the cost of the production. Someticketsa

can be discounted more than 60 percent
off the average price. Clippinger negoti-

ates with group sales representatives to
keep prices down.

“One of the things I’m very concerned
with is that the tickets stay truly cheap,”

‘ she said.

There will also be six Pitt Nights this
year, events which allow the entire Pitt
community to experience the Arts En-
counters usually reserved for the under-
graduates — albeit with a modest price tag

instead of free, including transportation,

~9

dessert reception and the opportunity
to meet the artists. Clippinger chooses
which events will be Pitt Nights based on
their popularity, a skill she’s proven as
evidenced by the five busloads full of Pit?
students, faculty and staff who attended a
symphony featuring violinist Sarah Chang
last year.

This year’s Pitt Nights‘ will kick off on
Friday, Sept. 11, with the CLO Cabaret’s
“8—Track: The Sounds of the 70s.”

A leader on defens,er read towin

A starting cornerback for three seasons, senior.
Qiélaron Berry now leads the defense

Evan Burgos
Staﬁwriter

aron Berry and DaveWannst—
edt are in this together.
Four years ago, when
Wannstedt took over the reigns as
head football coach at Pitt, Berry
was part of his ﬁrst recruiting
class.

3" Early on, they struggled.
Wannstedt’s teams couldn’t score
many points, and the defense had
to try to carry the load. Sometimes,
it was too much to bear.

But last year, with stud tail back
LeSean McCoy in the backﬁeld, the
Panthers had more opportunities
than ever to get into the end zone.
Behind McCoy’s 21 total touch-
downs and a well—balanced defense
anchored by Scott McKillop, the
Panthers went 9-3 and made their

‘lirst bowl game in the Wannstedt
era. ,

But with McCoy’s departure to
the NFL, the offense seemed erratic
through training camp. The makeup
of this year’s team might be headed
back toward that of 2007, when the
team went 5-7 and struggled to ﬁnd
consistency on offense.

And that’s where Berry steps
in.

Coming off a career year with
second team All-Big East honors,

lﬁerry is in his third full year as a
starter at cornerback. He said he
knows this year’s unit will have to
be stellar to win a lot of games with
an offense that is struggling.

But he’s prepared and eager to

ca:

take on the challenge.
“We’ve been down this road be-
fore when a couple years back the
‘ offense was struggling a little bit,”
Berry, a senior, said. “We had to
step up as a defense, so we’ve been
through this before. I feel we’re all
ready  Ifeel everybody’s going to
takeit as a chip on their shoulder.”

That is the mentality Berry will
try to impose on the defensive side
of the ball. It’s because Berry fash-
ions himselfa leader and the type of
veteran who can guide a team.

“I feel like I’m a big leader back
there, being around for four years,”
Berry said. “Starting for three and
we were all together last year, and
now we’re all back. I feel that if we’re
all on the same page and we commu-
nicate well, we can really do some
big things in the secondary. So, as
far as a leader, Ifeel like I’m going to
be a big part of our secondary back
there, as far as our communication
and lining up and all tha .”

A big part of what allows Berry
to feel poised as a leader is conﬁ-
dence.

Last season, he was second on
the team with three interceptions.
He’s viewed as a complete player,
outstanding in both pass coverage
and run support. He showed he
was a solid tackler, compiling 41
last year. He also ﬁgures to play a
role in the punt return game.

Having that type of versatility
allows Berry to be vocal in all phases
of the defense with buoyancy and
self-assurance.

“My conﬁdenceis sky—high right
now,” he said. “That’s a big thing

-With last year’s injury behind him, Gunn moves on

Alex Oltmanns
Staff Writer

When the Pitt football team
opens the season this Saturday
against Youngstown State, no
one will be happier to get back
on the field than linebacker
Adam Gunn.
The last time he suited up for
a game was last year’s season
opener against Bowling Green.
For Gunn, that game was nearly
his last in a blue-and-gold uni-
form. ’ " .
During that game, Gunn and
former Pitt linebacker Scott
McKillop collided‘ in a play dur-
ing the second half. While McKil-
lop was able to walk away from
it, the collision left Gunn out for
the rest of his senior season with
a broken neck. A
' Even though he was restricted
to the sidelines with a neck brace
for nearly the whole season, he
did not resign to the thought that
he had played in his last game.
Instead, he appealed to the NCAA

for a sixth year of eligibility.
“It was real tough. It was

‘about a four—month [appeal]

process,” Gunn said. “During
the season we were getting all
the paperwork together and
then immediately following
[the season] we started ﬁling
all the papers with a lot of dif-
ferent medical records and a lot
of letters from a lot of different
individuals.” .

The NCAA does not give out
sixth years of eligibility often
and considers many variables
when making its decision. Pitt
fans know this all too well. Last

A summer the committee denied

Mike Cook in his appeal to play

a sixth season of college basket— .

ball. A
Gunn, who graduated in April

2008 with a bachelor’s degree in A
communication and rhetoric, is ,

now a graduate student enrolled
in the School of Public and Inter-

national Affairs, ‘and he’s excited V

to play another year of collegiate
football for the Panthers.

The women’s volleyball team has started off stronger this season than last year.

Randy Lieberman
Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s volleyball team avoided the
slow, disappointing start that plagued it last
season by taking two of its ﬁrst three games of
the season. The Panthers competed at Sheraton
Riverside Cardinal Classic hosted by the Univer-
sity of Louisville on Friday and Saturday.

One of the wins was a 3-0 upset victory
over No. 18—ranked Wichita State, a team that
advanced to the second round of the NCAA
Tournament andwas coming ofl'a29—0 regular
season last year. .

“Itwas great. I thinkwe won alot this week-
end and had really good success going 2-1 this
weekend against good competition,” Pitt coach

Toby Rens said. “It’s a really good measuring"

point, and I think we learned a lot about this
team, their drive and detennination.”

If this is any indication of things to come,
it’s an encouraging sign for a team that Rens
says has a legitimate shot of reaching the NCAA
Tournament this year. .

“It just really shows the work ethic and char-
acter of this team who have been ‘really good
since the spring, and thefve picked up on where

we left offlast year,” he said. “Over the last three
weeks, I told them I’m really proud of what they
accomplished.”

The Panthers avoided last year’s disappoint-
ment, when they lost their ﬁrst two games on
the way to a 3-8 start, by winning their ﬁrst
two of the year this time around. They won
their opening match against Belmont before
upsetting Wichita State, but dropped their ﬁnal
‘game to Arizona in the tournament.

“Even though you don’t like to lose, a lot of

’" encouraging things were taken out of it,” Rens

said. “It was a great program weekend and we
played great volleyball on both sides of the net
and did an exceptional job of executing our
game plan and pushing the tempo.”

In their matchup against Wichita State,
the Panthers won their three highly contested
games against the Shockers by the scores of
25-22, 25-23 and 25-21. '

Senior Meagan Dooley led the Panthers with
16 kills and seven blocks, and senior Michelle
Rossi recorded 21 digs.Junior Imani Harper led
the Panthers with .800 hitting percentage.

Overall, Pitt out—blocked the Shockers 10-9
and held them to a .099 hitting clip.

“They’re a great program and a conference
champion and top 25 team,” Rens said. “It was

atjesse Owens Memorial Stadium.

“We played with a lot of heart. Our mental
toughness was really great today,” Pitt head
coach Sue Moy—Chin said. “I just thought our
girls played really well today collectively. We
just kept working hard knowing that our
chances would come and when they did we
took advantage of it.”

Pitt goalkeeper Morie Kephart tied a
career high with 12 saves in the game. She
made a diving save with 32 seconds left in
the game to prevent the Buckeyes ( 1-1-1) from

' tying the score.

“Morie Kephart was amazing,” Chin said.
“She kept us in the game. She put us in a

position to be ahead when we had a chance v

to ﬁnish. Our defense played really well in
front of her, too.” 4
Cuba put Pitt in front 1-0 with her ﬁrst
goal in the 56th minute of the second half.
“Her ﬁrst goal came off some good defen-
sive work,” Chin said. “She created a turnover

» and got a one vs. one with the goalkeeper. She

was really composed and dribbled around
her to put it into the open net.”

Minutes later, The Buckeyes answered A

off a Paige Maxwell header goal. But in the
79th minute, Cuba put the Panthers in the
lead for good on a goal off 21 Laura Berbert
deﬂection. Chin said Liz Carroll created the
opportunity by attacking the ball around
the outside.

Cuba, an.2009 ESPN High School All-
American, is the only player that has scored
for the Panthers this year. She netted her
ﬁrst career goal in Pitt’s season opener 1-0
victory against Buffalo last week.

ﬁculties resulted from the strong wind the
Buckeyes had at their backs during the ﬁrst
half, which the Panthers had tobattle. She
also said that Pitt had difficulty possessing
the ball, but she was pleased with the way
her team defended several strong corner
kicks from the Buckeyes.

The Panthers added eight shots and three
shots on goal in the second half, while the
Buckeyes produced 11 shots and two shots on
goal. And as of the 72nd minute, the Panthers
led Ohio State 6-5 in second—half shots and
3-1 in shots on goal. ’

“The second half we did a much better
much better job of possessing the ball,” Chin
said. “That was a little bit of the difference
for us in terms of creating chances.”

Ohio State outshot the Panthers 23-9 and
8-2 on goal for the game. i

Pitt’s KlarissaAmes and Katie Caslin each
had a shot on goal for the Panthers, and Car-
roll added three shots.

With the victory, Chin was happy with
her team’s performance on the road. She
said that although the team could continue
to improve on possession and ball handling,
the positive play outweighed the negative
in the win.

“We can always work on some things,”
Chin said,,“But the things that stood out for
me more were the things thatwe did well,
just continuing to battle hard and believing
we were going to get the win.”

The Panthers next game is at Kent State
on Friday at 4 p.m. Pitt doesn’t return home
until they take on Big East rival West Virginia
on Sept. 18.

|t’s time for the NFL and
MLB to control their rookies

Greg Trietley
Stajfwriter

I demand a raise.

Though technically a rookie
at this level, I think I proved my
journalistic skills in the chal-
lenging high school newspaper
circuit —- at least enough for you
to respect my stipulations.

I want a few million guar-
anteed, along with bonuses ifI
write anything worth publishing,
though you’ll have to speak to my
agent about that.

Really, deep down I just want
to start writing, once every oth-
er week over a predetermined
schedule with designated rest
periods.

Don’t laugh, it’s not outra-
geous. I have company.

First-year wide receiver Mi-
chael Crabtree remains a holdout
at 49ers training camp. He be-

  

 

lieves he deserves more money
than the paltry $38.25 million
fellow ﬁrst—round wide-out Dar-
rius Heyward-Bey signed for.
And three weeks ago, pitcher
Stephen Strasburg signed a con-
tract worth a guaranteed $15.1
million with the Washington Na-
tionals, the biggest deal ever for
any player right out of college.
So I have my justification.
OK, OK, I’m sorry. It is outra-
geous. It is idiotic. Rookie con-

tracts across leagues are out of
control. I‘

At first, Strasburg and his
agent, Scott Boras — engineer
of Alex Rodriguez’s famous $252
million contract —— reportedly
demanded $50 million guaran-
teed from the Nationals, accord-
ing to the Washington Post. The
entire Nationals team currently
makes just shy of $62 million.

Logically, the Nationals
should have the leverage when

is currently conduting clinical trials in h foloing area:

inking an unproven rookie. But,
no, Major League Baseball gives
Strasburg the edge.

In Strasburg’s corner: the op-
tion to return to college for his se-
nior season with San Diego State.
The Nationals have a so—called
generational talent — along with
the fanbase —— and could walk
out the door. Strasburg re-enters
the Draft next season and gets a
big-market team to pay himwhat
Washington would not.

In the Nationals’, corner: a .

compensatory Draft pick from
the MLB should they fail to sign
him. Talk about leverage.

So, Strasburg and Boras leave.

the bargaining table with mil-
lions guaranteed and stipulations
that include a Major League ros-
ter spot immediately.

At least Strasburg’s argument
had some grounds in reality.
Crabtree, meanwhile, bases his
request for $4o~plus million on

Now a senior, Berry aims

previous seasons.

with college, football. A lot of it’s mental ——
you got to know whatyou’re doing at the right
time. That’s pretty much what I do best. I play
fast because I_know what I’m doing.”

Berry has brought all that to the table
throughout training camp —— the most physi-
cal camp Wannstedt has ever run, with live
contact drills every day.

“Aaron had a great camp, he really did,”
Wannstedt said. “He’s playing within the de-
fense, he’s playing disciplined. He’s a cover
corner that we can do some things with him
to take advantage of his experience and ability.
Aaron’s had a very good training camp, and I
expect him to have a great year.”

And when asked if Berry is the leader of
the defense, the coach obliged. -

“He’s one of the leaders. I think we have
several, and he’s deﬁnitely one of them.”

With self—conﬁdence and expectations by
the coaching staff, it now becomes time for
Berry to translate it to the ﬁeld.

In a week, the Panthers will open their

season at home against Youngstown State.
The opponent doesn’t ﬁgure to be much of a
problem for Pitt, but it begins the campaign to
achieve something neither Berry nor Wannst-
edt has accomplished when coming into this
program together four years ago —— Big East
supremacy.

And that is the driving force behind the
senior defensive back's season. This time, even
if the defense is saddled with greater pressure
to carry the program, Berry is determined
on one thing.

“I’m just worried about a Big East Cham-
pionship,” Berry said. “That’s what I want to
do, being here, we were supposed to turn the
program around — Wannstedt’s ﬁrst recruit-
ing class — and I feel with a Big East Champi-
onship, that’s a good way to go ou .”

In fact, Berry is so set on the idea that he
is itching to hit the ﬁeld after a grueling and
hot training camp.

“We’re all in shape, ready to go,” Berry said.
“I can’t wait until next Saturday.”

might’ve ever heard,” he said. “Coach
Wannstedt gave me a call, and I couldn’t
have been any happier.”

After coming back from any type of
injury, an athlete. is hesitant to receive
the first hit of initial contact, but with

something so sensitive as a neck injury it

makes things a little harder.

“To be honest, I try not to think about
it,” Gunn said about his previous injury.
“The first hit was a shocker. I wasn’t sure
how it was going to feel but it felt good.
There were no problems at all, and now I’m
just moving forward 100 percent.”

A starter in 2007, Gunn ﬁnished third
on the team with 59 total tackles and es-
tablished himself as one of the team lead-
ers on defense heading into last season.
Now in his sixth year, he is the unques-
tioned veteran leader of the defense, as he
has the ability to play all three linebacker
positions. 9

With his sixth year of eligibility and
his emergence as a leader, Gunn doesn’t
expect to slow down this season.

“I feel like I’m even stronger than I was
before the injury,” he said. “Because with
the time I had off last season, as soon as I
was cleared to begin rehab I started work-
ing on every part of my body and not just
my neck. So I would say every part of my
body is stronger than it’s ever been.” .

That’s good news for a Pitt defense that
could be one of the best in the country.
With Gunn back in the lineup and several,
other starters returning, the defense will
be intimidating to opposing teams this
season. I

game last season. But the Panthers returned
junior Amy Town, Dooley and Rossi from last
year’s team. Following the tournament, Dooley
and Town were named to the All-tournament
team.

“We had great leadership from Meagan,
Rossi and Melissa [Stadelman],” Rens said.
“All three are seniors and all are captains. A lot
of the leadership was already there, and this
spring they had a chance to grow into leaders
on the court.” '

Town led the Panthers in kills against Ari-

zona with 21, and Rens said she is also an im-
portant leader of this year’s squad.

“Amy has certainly improved and I think
she’s really worked hard on her all around game
to become a better passer and defender,” Rens
said. “She will lead us» in scoring for a lot of
matches and she’s a very consistent player.”

Rens also had high praise for players step-
ping into starting roles, such as Harper and
sophomore Allyson Hodnik. Hodnik, the team’s
setter, led Pitt in assists for all three matches
and has improved from coming off the bench

this year to taking a starting role.

Returning home with a winning record is
good news for the Panther and Rens looks for-
ward to playing in front of a Fitzgerald Field
House crowd.

“I thought we represented Pitt quite well, ,
and we played with a lot of pride and passion,”
he said. “We have alot of energy and enthusiasm
and people really enjoy what they see when they
watch us play.”

Pitt plays its home opener this Wednesday
at 7 p.m. against Kent State.

franchise history before the team named
him the starter.

While Stafford and Sanchez enjoy their
wallet-busting contracts, some are lam-
basting the league trend. Colts president
Bill Polian told the Indianapolis Star that
rookie contracts are “crazy.” Last season,
seven-time Pro Bowl center Kevin Mawae
used “disheartening” to describe Matt
Ryan’S six—year, $72 million deal.

On draft day, teams look at how sign.-
able a prospect is just as they look at his
4o—time or fastball speed — Boras in base-
ball and Drew Rosenhaus in football noto-
riously drive a hard bargain. Don’t draft a
player you can’t afford, teams think.

' But to blame solely the players L5 as
misguided as some of their demands. The

current system pushes them to it, as a NFL .

contract is practically meaningless.
Franchises can terminate contracts

as easily as Brett Favre retires. Without

guaranteed money in a contract, one seri-

, ous injury or a bad season ends a player’s

financial relationship with a team. The
average NFL career is just three and a
half seasons.

While baseball and football struggle
to get a grip on first—year contracts, the
NHL, for once, has it right. The league
caps rookie deals. I A

Sidney Crosby and Alexander Ovechkin
both had base Salaries of less than $1 mil-
lion in their ﬁrst year.

The NFL should adopt a similar poli-
cy. Teams shouldn’t be handcuffed into
spendingimoney on players who haven’t
earned it. Get a rookie cap, get the player
signed, get him into camp and get him
ready to play. Then he can start to- work

toward his payday, as Crosby and Ovech— .

kin did.

Baseball is a few more Strasburg—type
deals away from needing a rookie cap as
well, but the word “cap” usually causes

heads to explode in those parts. But, at the .

least, give the Nationals some leverage.
