Posvar concerned

State Appropriation Minimal

BY BILL MOORE

Gov. Milton Shapp recom-
mended yesterday a minimal $1.5
million increase in Pitt’s state
appropriation for the 1977-78 ﬁscal
year, prompting Chancellor Wesley
Posvar to express “very deep
concern” over the University’s
ability to maintain its current
quality of eduation. .

Shapp, in his state budget
presentation, proposed an overall
appropriation of $61.9 million. Pitt
requested $69.5 million, or a $9.1
million increase over last year’s
appropriation. .

Pitt’s general’ education appro-
priation would be increased by 2.9
percent under
proposal, but student aid and the
medical school would see no
increase, and the dental medicine
clinic would suffer an approximate
15 percent decrease in state

funding. -

, At a .press conference following if

Shapp’s budget speech, Posvar
complained that the minor increase
in appropriation in fact represents a
decrease, since Pitt’s budget

» mandates a 5 percent increase to

cover inﬂation alone.

Asked if another tuition increase
was in store for Pitt students,
Posvar said it was far too early to
speculate, but expressed reluctance
to hike what already is “one of the
highest tuitions
supported institution in the United
States.”

“In Pennsylvania, there has been
prevalent a. philosophy that stu-
dents should pay a large share of the
cost of undergraduate and graduate
education,” Posvar said. “There-
fore, the slight increase in funding
for the University in the past has

been a de facto mandate by the state
to increase’ tuition. We think that
should be stopped.”

Posvar, along with some mem-
bers of the Board of Trustees
present at the press brieﬁng, said
Pitt’s current tuition - rate has
already put college costs above
what lower income students can
afford.

Posvar expressed hope the state
legislature would decide, as they
had inpast years, to grant Pitt an
appropriation higher than Shapp’s
recommendation, and called on
state residents to urge their
legislators to take such a step.

Teaching

BY KAREN KADILAK

The long-awaited teaching eval-
uation and faculty development
program was adopted by the
University Senate Council at its
monthly meeting, Monday.

The-program, which calls for the
establishment of -formal, depend-
able student evaluation of courses
and teaching methods and a
corresponding self-evaluation by
faculty members, was approved by
a 27-6 margin.

Originally, the proposal was to be

.voted on during last month's

meeting of the _Senate Council.
However, the Educational Policies
Committee, one of the three
committees studying the proposal,
did not give its- ﬁnal report on the
topic. ,
At that time, an. Educational
Policies Committee spokesman said
the establishment of two new
offices, The Ofﬁce of Evaluation of

Teaching and the Office for Faculty ‘

Development, would duplicate
existing programs.

“We don’t want to support any
plan that would call for the addition
of two new offices when we feel the
existing mechanisms are as suf-
ﬁcient,” Educational Policies Com-
mittee Chairman Jack Matthews

stated following last month's

meeting. ,
The revised report submitted to
the Senate Council by the
Educational Policies Committee‘
this month expressed a similar
concern. The report stated: ‘ “The

Equitable Continues

Langley Investigation   

BY MREA CSORBA

The ruptured Equitable Gas
line which was ordered back from
Houston for last week’s coroner’s
inquest into the two Langley
explosiori deaths, has been re-
turned to Houston and is under-
going metallurgical testing.

Testing that would have deter-
mined whether the break in the
six-foot main was caused by the
explosion, or whether it had been
there and caused gas seepage into
Langley Hall, was interruped by
County Coroner Cyril H. Wehet’s
subpoena which ordered the
shipment of the pipe back for last

“We are not at all convinced it
was a natural gas explosion. And
we are deﬁnitely not convinced our
pipes were responsible,” Raymond

of the Center for the Evaluation of
Teaching to serve all units under the
Provost and the creation of a
centralized unit for faculty develop-
ment in teaching.”

“Our disagreement with the
report was only a small, small
part,” Matthews said following
Monday's meeting. “Otherwise,
we feel the outcome of the
discussions held at the meeting and
the" report are very healthy ones,
indeed.

“We just don't support the
addition of the two new ofﬁces.”

In other Council action Chancel-
lor Wesley Posvar announced in the
Chancellor’s Report that Sister
Rosemary Donley, associate profes-
sor of General Nursing, has been
named the recipient of the Robert
Wood Johnson Fellowship.

Equitable Gas Company said. He _‘

blast.

testings, nothing will change
scientiﬁc evidence that it was a
natural gas explosion, ’ ’ Wecht said.
“And because Langley sits on an
uncompetitive area, serviced only
by Equitable Gas, the gas came
from an Equitable line.”

Testa said the metallurgical test
results will be forth-coming in a few
weeks. '

The unclaimed, empty gas line
which Equitable found running
parallel to their ruptured line
accompanied the damaged gas line
to Houston, as it had in the first
shipment.

He added that “An informal
technique” involving medical fa-
cilities, public relations and student
affairs comprise a hotline network
now in effect that will be able to
handle future emergencies.

Posvar also introduced recently
elected Student Government Board
members Bernie Payne, Ahmie
Baum, Josh Baylson, Chip Hubbard
and Joanne Levinson.

Preliminary discussions were '
held concerning the Task lon Honors
Program. It was announced By
Associate Provost David R. Powers

that the Task Force has been '
meeting on a regular basis in order
to develop a series of recommenda-
tions on the establishm_ent and-
operation of undergraduate-level
honors programs withing the
University.

Basic Liability Claims   

A total 24 personal property
claims resulting from the Langley
Hall "blast have been _ﬁled against
the University to date, according to.
Pitt’s Assistant Treasurer Ted
Corbett. ‘ ‘

Property claims for coats, eye-
glasses’ and books have been ﬁled
andare being processed by Pitt’s
three insurance companies.

Corbett said there is no deadline
for filing " claims. “We hoped,

his goals for the paper.

“I’d like to see the paper
independent of the University, like
Penn State’s Daily Collegian,” Hall

 said. “We could operate much’

i -. The editor-elect, who will assume

office March '15, advocated a
change to a metro-size paper, like
the Pittsburgh Press.

“We also should be making plans

‘ now for the paper to go daily in a few

years,” Hall said.

All three elected staffers stressed
the need for increased circulation to
attract advertising revenue and to
thicken the paper.

In the vote breakdown, business
personnel cast one full vote for
business staff candidates and

A one-quarter vote for the editorial

candidate. Editorial staffers, in

 turn, cast one full vote for the

Shapp Appropriation

Causes ‘Deep Concern’

(Continued from Page I)

Posvar pointed out that Pitt is the
largest employer in the city, with a
budget of over $180 million. He
estimated that Pitt generates an
income for the area of over one-half
billion dollars.

“The dental clinic budget was cut
from $600,000 to $500,000,” Posvar
said, “and this will mean a direct
cut in services to the public.”

“A tiny shift of funds now spent
on highways could make all the
difference between a healthy
system of higher education and an
unhealthy system,” Posvar said.
He called on the state to put a higher
priority on higher education.

Shapp proposed a $4 million
appropriation for Pitt’s medical

school, which represents no in-
crease over last year’s funding,
despite what Posvar termed “a
state of near crisis” in that school's
budget.

“We certainly can not go on

providing doctors and dentists if the

state and federal governments
aren’t willing to pay the price,”
Posvar warned.

Pitt’s dental clinic, which pro-
vides low cost dental care to many
area residents, was budgeted 15
percent less than last year in
Shapp’s presentation, far below
what Pitt requested.

The Pitt appropriation recom-
mendation was part of a $9.4 billion
state spending program proposed
by Shapp in his traditional address
to the legislature.

SGB Issues '77-Elitism

The new office regulations adopted by the Student Government Board
(SGB) do nothing but go against campaign promises of availability to
students. The rules do not give the offices a friendly aura and will not
make students feel free to drop in any time and discuss problems.

Instead, the office now has an antiseptic corporate sensation about it
that makes one feel that if he is not on oflicial business, he’d better not
loiter.

Like a hot air baloon without ballast, the new Board has yet to come
down from the thrill of winning. Under victory’s intoxicating inﬂuence,
regulations were passed to make the third ﬂoor offices more
professional.

There will be no profanity, no smoking, no sleeping and no putting
feet on furniture in the rear oﬂices. The rear oﬂices have now been
euphemized into executive offices. The common student has no access
to them without executive authorization from those with executive
priviledges. .

The rationale behind restricting smoking and feet upon furniture is
understandable. One is a health hazard and other damages items
bought with the student’s own activities fund monies.

But restricting profanity? Heavens to Betsylilnstead of trying to
provide student leadership, SGB is providing parenthood. The gears of
government do not mesh more smoothly in the absence of four-letter
words. ’

SGB’s restricting student access to the executive suite does not create
an atmosphere of professionalism. Instead it creates a sickening sweet
odor of elitism.

This elitism is a disappointing act by a group that campaigned as

- people who would bring the student back to student govermnent. The

biggest disappointment is that this stonewalling move was their first
move.

Ifthe Board expects to accomplish any of their goals they had better
return to earth soon.

A Lesson On Input;

Resident students can be reasonably satisfied with the announced
room and board increases of two and three percent respectively. The

A Resident Student Association (RSA) and the Housing Office worked
‘ hand in hand to keep costs and minimize this increase.

The two percent increase is an accomplishment in light of last year's
six percent housing increase and the 1976 inﬂation rate of approximately
six percent. The elimination of waste by both administration and RSA
kept costs from increasing at that rate.

The mutual cooperation is contrary to the way the dorm rennovation
plan was sprung on the RSA during a regular meeting. Director of
Auxilliary Services, Tom Albert and Housing Director Don Hughes
accepted budgetary input from the RSA whenever the RSA wanted to
offer it. And subsequent RSA input concerning dorm rennovations have
been considered before decisions were made.

This should be a lesson to the RSA and other student groups. Their
input will be received only if they demonstrate the ambition to offer it.

Although the intentions of the Housing Oﬂice are apparently aligned
with student interests, the RSA must keep after them in the months to
come. The Housing Ofﬁce is not obligated to keep costs down. Their
rates are competitive with off-campus rates. Hundreds of student
housing requests are turned down each year.

Housing charges have not increased at a pace equal to demand. The
 must insure that this policy continues.

Against the Death of Beauty

BY GARY GOVERT

The question, as I sat with a
book in one hand and a record in the

other, was basically this: Should I .\

read “A Child’s Christmas in
Wales” to these friends, or should I
abandon my ego to a whirling vinyl
reproduction of the author’s own
inimitable voice?

«Dylan Thomas was a verbal
virtuoso, a, master of the spoken
word. Even on this lifeless record,
his deep and salty, sea-town poet's
English rhymed without rhyming
and beautifully harmonized sound
with meaning. I had practiced, but
Thomas was the professional,

_ interpreting his own work; I was

pure amateur, picking my way
through trams and marzipan. ..

My audience, for whatever
reason, "indicated a preference for
ﬂesh and blood over electronic
proficiency, and I read the piece. It
went as well as could be expected.
More important than my elocution-
ary success or failure, though, is an
appreciation of the cultural aesthe-
tic that initially urged my giving
way to the Dylan Thomas disc.

broadest sense—has become big

Letter

R-e_novationA|tern

We are writing in response to the
proposed plan to change ’ the
‘eleven’ (i.e.: 311, 411, 511, etc.)
rooms in_ Holland Hall, that are now
triples, into quads. We feel there is
sufficient reason to leave the
‘eleven’ rooms as they are now, and
to increase the occupancy of the
‘twenty-six’ (i.e.: 326, 426, 526,
etc.) instead.

The difference in measurements
and layouts of the rooms are the
basis for our letter.

The measurement of the ‘twenty-
six’ rooms is 342.94 square feet,
including two closets; the measure-
ment of the ‘eleven’ room is 281.51
square feet, including one closet.
From these square footages, we
contend that the ‘twenty-six’ room
provides more area for four people.

The layout of the ‘twenty-six’
room supplies more individual
privacy for each occupant than the
layout of the ‘eleven’ room. The

‘eleven’ rooms are rectangular in
shape and do not provide for any
separation of living quarters; the
‘twenty-six’ rooms are irregular in
shape and offer the girls a chance,to
define their own living and study
areas. p ~. = H ~

   

entertainment technology. News-
papers and magazines are jammed
with advertisements for stereos,
radios, televisions, records and
tapes. Most of these items are
expensive, and for many we pay a
price that can’t be measured in
dollars and cents.

More and more, we take our
entertainment vicariously. Tech-
nology and our worship of
professionalism are immobilizing
us.

Sports have become less a thing
to be enjoyed actively, and more a
thing to be experienced ‘through
machines conveniently located in
houses and bars. Many of us know a
wicked electric guitar when we hear
one, but couldn’t find middle C on
a piano. .

No longer do we spend Sunday
afternoons relaxing with family and
friends—we’d rather watch - Franco
run for daylight. Communal
singing is passe, if not a bit
queer—-we can have Eric Clapton on_
the headphones.

Reading aloud, like family
sing-alongs and other traditional,
non-professional art forms, is
fading from the American scene.
Ethnic music and dancing has, in
many cases, become something
performed by an entrepreneurial
few. Pretechnological “folk art”
may soon be found only in dry and
dusty museum exhibits, ' like
dinosaur bones.

As co-presidents of Holland Hall
and as’, previous and current
occupants of the ‘eleven’ room as a
triple, we deﬁnitely feel that the
‘twenty-six’ room is much more
suitable for living arrangements as
a quad than the ‘eleven’ room_. The

The advertising media, via our

without a J antzen suit; Adidas are
the only way to run; music isn’t
music without a Marantz; amateur

The intrusions of technology and

The first constraint is money.
With a component system, the price
range is very versatile. One can
start with a simple, inexpensive
system and add on and upgrade the
equipment as ﬁnancial ‘conditions
allow. A simple system can be
purchased for about $200-$400,
depending on the complexity of the
parts. First-rate, high ﬁdelity
reproduction should fall in a price of
$500-$1000., The real connoisseur
may pay more than $1000 for a
super system.

How much are you really into
music? If you’re the type who only
listens to talk shows and buys only
recent Rudy Vallee records, you
probably won’t want to invest a lot
of dough in a good system. Don’t let
a sharp salesman tell you otherwise.

What size and type of room do
you live in? Generally, the larger
the room, the more ampliﬁcation
power you’ll need. More power is
also needed in a room with shag
carpeting, open doorways and a lot
of junk. A “live” room, such as
those in the Towers, would require
less power (unless you wanted
someone to hear your music while
driving down Fifth Avenue).

A  spirit of Pride And  
Songs for a Nation

BY PAMELA EUSI

A Tribute to Woody Guthrie
Various Artists
Warner Bl'0S., 2W 3007

“I am out to sing songs that will
prove to you that this is your world
and that if it has hit you pretty hard

/7 /3
/.



ARLO GUTHRIE
and knocked you for a dozen
loops...no matter what color, what
size you are, how you are built, I am
out to sing the songs that make you
take pride in yourself and your
work."

Woody Guthrie made the above
quote—-which has since become
part of his legacy —sometime
during his 55 years, in one of his
more talkative moods. He has

  
   

succeeded in doing what he wanted
to do. Through his music and the
poetry of his songs, Guthrie had
transformed the saga of the

, traveling loner into a legend.

His autobiography, “Bound for
Glory,’ is being made into a movie.
They're trying to Hollywood-ize
G,uthrie’s memory. Although the
big people might succeed in making
the money from the ﬁlm, the little
people will hold the memory of
Guthrie dear. He sang for them and
them alone.

After his sister died in a ﬁre, after
his mother's death in a state insane
asylum and after his father
committed suicide in the face of
bankruptcy, Guthrie was on his
own, alone and on the road at 17.

1929 marked the onset of the
Great Depression, and Guthrie
traveled the highways and byways
of America doing odd jobs and
singing wherever he went. His
songs are about his origins, the dust
bowl of Oklahoma, migrant work-
ers, the down and out, hobos, life
and hope. He picked up remnants
of the blues from blacks in his little
Okie town, and created his songs
from the rhythms and textures of
speech.

‘Guthrie fought against poverty,
bigotry and the rich man's justice.
He stood for the underdog and the

F

K

basic human spirit. His son Arlo, '

now 29, often tells the story of the
circumstances of his birth in Coney
Island. It seems that Guthrie told
the nurse in the hospital to put down
“all” on his birth certiﬁcate where
it said “religion.” The nurse
wouldn’t do that. Guthrie told them
it was either “all” or “none.”

For about 25' years Guthrie
roamed the America of the 30’s and
40’s until he was hospitalized for
Huntington’s disease, which also
killed his mother. Guthrie
remained in the hospital for roughly
20 years before he died on October
3, 1967.

Guthrie was the pioneer of the
popularization of country and
western sound, particularly for the
urban centers of the country and
especially in the Northeast.

His folksinging friends, people
like Joan Baez, Pete Seeger, Bob
Dylan and Guthrie’s son A_rlo,
wanted to pay tribute to Guthrie’s
great talent. They staged two
concerts in Carnegie Music Hall,
New York City, and in January of
1968. So as not to deprive the West
Coasters, a third concert was given
in September, 1970, at the
Hollywood Bowl, Los Angeles. This

 

two-record collection represents the
best moments of the three concerts.

“Tribute” is a gem of folk
selections all performed with
feeling and vigdr in honor of the

' pioneer Guthrie and the way he

might play these selections if he
could be there performing with his
friends.

Between the songs are moments
of narration and reﬂection—pro-
vided by Will Geer, Robert Ryan
and Peter Fonda—either about or
by Guthrie. The selection by Fonda
is risque and ﬁlled with sensuous
and honest sexual poetry.

Arlo Guthrie provides a gritty-
version of “Oklahoma Hills” in the
style of his father. Judy Collins
soulfully sings the familiar “Dusty
Old Dust (So Long, It’s Been Good
to Know Yuh). ” Bob Dylan rambles
through ‘ ‘I Ain’t Got No Home” at a
swinging pace with shouting chorus
and gutsy verses that give a
preview of his current style of
singing.

Of the collection, Tom Paxton’s
“Pastures of Plenty, ” Judy Collins’
‘ ‘Deportee’ ’ and Joan Baez’s
‘ ‘Hobo’s Lullaby” are the best cuts.
Paxton’s voice gives life and hope to

£2.

¢

the lonely people of his song:

people who “come with the dust
and (are) gone with the wind.” The
injustices of the migrant workers
are personiﬁed in the verse “All

V along your green valley I‘ will woék

till I die.”

“Deportee” is a haunting ballad
about the plight of the Mexican ﬁeld
workers imported to farm at a cheap
price, cheaper than what the fgrm
owners would have to pay the
displaced white families if they

‘I would hire them.

“Hobo’s Lullaby” is one of
Guthrie’s favorite songs written by
Goebel Reeves. Baez tenderly siﬁgs
this number about the ever-travel-
in’ hobos. The lightness and
soprano range of her voice add a
nostalgic touch to a memorable

, composition.

“A Tribute to Woody Guthgie”
concludes with perhaps his most
remembered work, “This Land is
Your Land,” performed by the
company onstage. This song, more
than any other, embodies the
Guthrie hallmarks of pride and
spirit. Perhaps we can now look tga
new generation of the embodiment
of that inspiration.

BY RON SIEGEL

-COLLEGE PARK, Md.——The
Pitt basketball team stayed even
with ACC powerhouse Maryland

' for one half lad night, but because

the Panthers did so in the second
«-half, nobody seemed to notice.

Down 43-28, and not really in the
game at half-time, the Panthers
outscored Maryland in the second
half, but nonetheless, suffered their
18th defeat in 22 starts, losing
88-75;

Junior All-American candidate
Larry Harris, single-handedly kept
the Panthers close with a stellar
38-point performance. It was the

  ebruary 1  

Maryland Mauls Panthers   7

ﬁnest output of the season for the
6-6 forward, eclipsing his 35-point
performance against Duquesne last
Saturday.

The Panthers were thwarted by
their usual problems—namely poor
shooting and rebounding—in the
first half. Leading rebounder Mike
Rice, playing with a taped left
pinkey ﬁnger because of a pulled
tendon, was held to just three
rebounds in the game. Pitt just
couldn’t stop 6-10 Maryland center
Mike Davis, who grabbed 21
rebounds, including 12 in the first
half.

The Panthers came out shooting
very coldly, and Maryland slowly

  Pitt Tankers Intercept

Vikings at the Pass

BY JIM GEFSKY

Although the Cleveland State
Vikings are not led by Fran
Tarkenton, they fared no better last
Saturday at their home pool against
the Panther tankers than Taken-
ton’s National Football Conference
gang did against the American
Football Conference in four super
bowls. Pitt won nine of 13 events
and tallied a ﬁnal score of 71-42 in
upping their record to 6-2.

The stars of the meet were Mark
Schuman and Jerry DeMuro.
Schuman set a new Pitt record when
he swam the 200-yard butterfly in
1:56.15. DeMuro was a double
winner, taking the 1,000-yard
freestyle in 9:37.61 and the
500-yard freestyle with a time of
4:57.61. Other individual winners
included Bill Wagner, who captured
the 200-yard individual medley in
2:02.15, Neal Wallace, who took the
200-yard backstroke with a time of

1 2:03.36, and Orlando Catinchi. who

won the 200-yard breast-stroke in:
2:13.61. Pitt’s 400-yard medley
squad, anchored by Dave Civis, also
took a first place in 3:35.98.

The tankers also scored big in
diving when Dave Reeder, with one
of his best performances ever, won
the one-meter diving with a score of
Tom Fatyol took the
three-meter diving with a mark of
292.25.

“It was a relaxed meet—we had
one of our best performances of the
season, and this match helped our
confidence,” said pleased Pitt head
coach Dick Bradshaw. “We’re
resting more and swimming faster
and I definitely think we’re capable
of winning the Easterns.”

The tankers’ next meet is this
Friday at Trees Pool against
Youngstown State, the last match
before the Eastems.

TANKER TIDBITS—This Friday's
meet will be held at 4 p.m. instead
of the regularly scheduled time of 7
p.m. Assistant coach Fred Lewis
will guide the team in place of
Bradshaw, who will be in Regina,
Saskatchawan, guiding the U.S.
‘team in the Canadian Cup meet

top amateur swimmers from
America, Canada, Japan, Australia
and New Zealand.

Lose at Maryland

opened up a commanding lead by
denying Pitt follow-up shots.

The 17-6 Terrapins were quite
impressed by Harris, who sunk
almost all of his 16 field goals from
long range.

“Larry Harris was unbeliev-
able,” said Maryland’s head coach
Lefty Driesell. “I was putting three
or four players on him at different
times and he was still scoring.”

Said Driesell to Harris after the
game, “Next to David Thompson,
that’s the best anyone’s done since
I’ve been here.”

Absent from the Pitt lineup was
freshman guard Sonny Lewis.

‘ ‘He was late for practice Sunday,
so I suspended him,” said Head
Coach Tim Grgurich. Lewis was
dressed for the game but did not
play.

Grgurich was pleased with some
of the things he saw. “The second
half was very encouraging,” he
said. “I was impressed with what
we did as a team, both offensively
and defensively.

“We shot too quick in the first
half," he said. “We’re not a team
that can shoot quick because we're
not that strong. We can’t get the
rebounds that way. When we move
the ball around properly, like we did
in the second half, we get into
position and get our second shot.”

Harris and Grgurich were
encouraged by the Panthers playing
even with the Terrapins in the
second half.

“It’s a real good feeling,” said
Harris. ‘‘I’m trying to drill it into
the young guys’ heads.”

As to his own performance, Harris
credited his teammates with giving
him the picks and the passes he
needed. “I’m playing good
basketball, but not my best,”" he

Pantherettes Homesick  

BY KATHY KELLY

The Pantherette basketball
team survived two scares last
weekend in back-to-back contests at
the Pitt Field House, overcoming
West Chester, 83-72, in overtime
Friday‘, then nipping Penn State,

‘ 69-68, on Saturday.

Now 14-5, the Pantherettes
embarked on a grueling ﬁve-day
roadtrip last night. _losing to
Maryland, 82-53, with Temple,
Villanova and lmmaculata to follow.

West Chester held a fopr-point

 lead with 36 seconds to go when
p‘Wanda Randolph missed a des-
" ' paration shot, but was fouled in the

process. The Pitt center made both
free throws and the Pantherettes
immediately installed their press.

, Guard Kathy Paczkowski stole the

ball and tied the score at 72 ‘apiece
with 14 seconds left,‘ but .West

Chester failed to move the ball back
up court.

In overtime, it was all Pitt as the
Pantherettes scored 11 unanswered
points and Randolph showed her
dominance by blocking all the West
Chester attempts. '

“This was our best team effort,"
said coach Pat Wallace. ‘‘It showed
the maturity of our team. Everyone
worked well and used their heads.”

Early in the game Pitt was down
by six, but picked up the pace when
the contest became a battle of-
tumovers and matching buckets. A
field goal by forward MiMi
Senkowski put the Pantherettes on
top, 36-34, at the half.

Both teams improved somewhat
in the second _ half, while Pitt
displayed its depth by some
competent play by their substitutes,
especiallypforward Robin Fry, who

displayed her rebounding skills and

tallied several jumpers. With West
Chester ahead by six with seven

minutes remaining, Kim Raymond
sand two free throws, then_Fry hit

two ﬁeld goals to tie the game at 64-

West Chester’s Rose" Serino
tallied three unanswered ﬁeld
goals, but Pitt’s Kit Loeffler and
Semkowski scored to set up the

Pantherettes’ last-minute rally to

send the game into overtime.

Saturday evening, as the prelim
to the men’s game, the Pantheret-
tes squeaked the tough Lady Lions
from Penn State with Paczkowski
leading the way with 14 points and
Randolph hitting for 12 points and
collecting 19 rebounds.

In other action, the Pantherette
JV’s defeated the West Chester
JV’s, 72-66 Friday evening, with
freshman Nancy LaBach leading the
way for Pitt.

points, with 24 coming in the second half—but the 4-18 Panthers were no
match for the Maryland Terrapins, falling 88-75, in College Park last

night.

i said. “When we start winning, I’ll

feel like I’m playing good.”

Pitt and Maryland each sank 33
ﬁeld goals during the game, but the.
Terrapins canned 22 of 31 foul
shots, while Pitt made 9 oftheir 15. '
Pitt shot 41 percent from the floor,
while Maryland connected 52
per cent of the time.

Maryland was paced by Jo Jo
Hunter’s 17 points, and had six
players in double ﬁgures. Ed
Scheuermann was the only Panther
other than Harris to score more than
ten, finishing with twelve.
Scheuermann and Wayne Williams

in the water—“No, not this year.”

The Pantherettes blasted Penn
State, 76-55, to raise their dual meet
record to 4-1. ,

Pitt’s only loss this year came at_
the hands of Princeton, a meet
Pantherette coach Kate Mathison
called the “biggest meet of the
year.” However, two weeks ago,
Penn State upset Princeton, thus
making Sunda'y’s meetthe biggest
of the year for Pitt.

“We’ve been working hard to
prepare for this one, and we’re
ready,” said Mathison before the
meet. And the Pantherettes proved
just how ready they were.

Pitt jumped on top with a 7-0 lead
after winnin g the opénin g relay with
the team of Dianne Kluglein, Sue
Guyer, Nila DeJesus and Kathy
Stetler. It was Pitt’s ﬁrst victory in
this event in four meets. '

But Penn State pulled close with a
ﬁrst and a third place ﬁnish in the
200-yard freestyle. Christy Elston
was second for‘Pitt.

Jennifer Price and Jamie Conley
widened the Pantherette’ s lead with
a one-two ﬁnish in— the 200-yard ,

.individual medley. Price was first

with a time of 2: 17.3 and Conley was
second with a time of 2:17.8.

Kluglein notched third places in
the 50-yard backstroke and the
50-yard freestyle, an event won by
Stetler. Guyer took first in the
50-yard breast-stroke with a time of
32.81,. just 0.05 _ahead' of the
second-place swimmer from Penn
State.
