Famous consumer rights ad-
vocate Ralph Nader spoke to
A a filled Templitz courtroom in
the law .school last night about
the possible future of lawyers
and the problems with present
United States laws.
’’If you think that law school

justice in America, then you're
not wasting your time,” said
Nader.

Nader, a graduate of the
Harvard Law School, lectured
on how most law schools con-
centrate on corporate law and
the tendency of lawyers to de-
fend corporations instead of
helping the consumer."

Nader stressed the impor-
tance of working for the con-
sumer. ’’If you're in a
corporate firm and you've got
a big case that you've
researched that is going to be
argued before the Circuit
Court of Appeals or. the
Supreme Court, the senior
partner's going to argue the
case, after you did all the
work,” he said. ”Then you
have to sit around and watch
him botch it up.”

Nader also challenged, the .

Federal Communications
Commission. ”Who owns the
public airwaves? We do," he
said. ”Who licenses it? The
FCC. To whom? Mostly pri-
vate corporations. For how
much? Nothing.”

Pitt-Penn State Blood Drive

Challenge kicks off this week

By Andrea Dougherty
For The Pitt News

The Central Blood Bank of Pittsburgh began its
annual Pitt/Penn State Blood Drive Challenge in
the William Pitt Union yesterday. The goal set for
this year's Challenge by Pitt is 2,000 pints.

This year's drive is different from previous Blood
Bank drives due to the participation of Pitt Greeks
and the School of Nursing, accordingto Dave Ed-
munds, field representative for the blood bank.

“This is the first time in three years that these

groups are incorporated into our challenge,” said

Edmunds. .

Everyone is-hopingthat this year, Pitt will fi/nal—t J
ly triumph over Penn State,-which has.won.the..last‘

three years. ”We are sponsoring a head to head,
campus to campus vote among the donors," said
Edmunds. The vote used to be a popular one, in-
corporating students as well as company and’cor—
poration group votes in favor of Pitt or Penn State.
When giving blood, each donor will be asked
to cast a vote in favor of their favorite school. Bri-
an Lang, a Pitt student, said, ’’I think it's great that
people will be influenced by the competition;
however, I think they should realize that it's not
the competition but their blood that matters.”
Donations will go toward supplying‘ the 31
hospitals they support. ’’It is important to the hospi-
tals, in the current shortage of blood, that.this

A challenge be successful,” according to Edmunds. A r v

VOLUME EIGHTY-TWO, ISSUE‘ THIRTY-TWO

suffers another loss

By'Joyce M. Rosenberg

AP Business Writer

NEW YORK — Stock prices
tumbled again Monday a week
after their collapse as prices
plunged in Asia and Europe and
the Dow Jones industrial average
fell about_,157‘ points, its eighth
biggest percentage loss.

The Dow closed down 156.83
points to 1,793.93, according to
a preliminary reading.

It was the first day of trading af-
ter-its biggest weekly decline in
history. The average lost nearly
300 points last week.

The Dow's drop was the se-
cond biggest in points after last
Monday's and was an _8.04 per-
cent decline. That ranked it
eighth in percentage terms, just
ahead of the 7.84 percent on July

‘a21,1933. -- -.i i

The market closed at 2 p.m.
EST, two hours ahead of normal,
to allow the market to catch_ up ,
on paperwork. It also closed ear-
ly last Friday and will again
Tuesday. -

”The psychology has gotten
horrendous,” said Jack Baker,
head of block trading for Shear-
son Lehman Brothers Inc. ”Se|l—

ping continues to come in waves.

There are no buyers.” «

Stock markets in Tokyo and
London recorded large losses to-
day before trading began in New
York’. In the often-volatile Hong
Kong market, where trading had
been suspended for the last four
business days, prices took a
record drop. ‘

”Once you had the foreign
markets falling, you knew you

_ were going to -have a dump in

New York given the fragile con-
dition,” said Larry Wachtel, a
stock analyst and first vice presi-
dent of Prudential-Bache ‘Securi-

MIAMI — A man pulled a gun
from a briefcase and opened fire
at a Merrill Lynch brokerage
office Monday, killing the office

_ manager and critically wounding
another executive before fatally
shooting himself, police said.

Witnesses said the gunman
was a Merrill Lynch customer,
and Metro Dade Police Com-
mander William Johnson said the
recent stock market turbulence
apparently was a factor.

”We believe it was, in fact,
related to losses suffered in the
market during the recent down-
turn,” Johnson said, but he added
that this had not been confirmed.

The shootings occurred at a
large Merrill Lynch office outside
a trendy suburban shopping

center, The Falls, in southwest ‘

Dade County.
A bystander who spoke to
, brokers leaving the office said he
was told by them that the gun-
man-was a customer.

”A gentleman had come into
the building with a briefcase, in-
dicating that he had a check with
him, walked into the office with
two of the brokers, opened the

   

briefcase, took out a gun and shot
two of them and himself,” said
Bruce Anderson.

Johnson said it's possible there
were no eyewitnesses to the
shooting. y

’’I think they went into an office
to talk, and I think everyone who
was in there was shot,” he said.

Rash of break-ins has
churches ’distraught’

PITTSBURGH —- A rash of
break-ins at 20 churches since
August has alarmed clerics, who
say they can ill afford burglar
alarm systems and repairs to
broken stained glass windows.

”We’re distraught," said the
Rev. Michael Sfanos, pastor of
Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox

WHEN: Tomorrow

Church, which was ransacked
and robbed of 16 chalices, a
cross and other items Oct. 16.

Break-ins were discovered Sun-
day at four churches in the city's
North Side neighborhood. Mem-
bers worshipped at all four on
Sunday.

Losses have been largely con-
fined to the theft of cash from
poor boxes and church strong

boxes, although, several
churches have been ransacked,
police said.

”We have to think about in-
stalling an expensive security sys-
tem at a time when we are not
even meeting our regular ex-
penses,” said the Rev. Daniel B.
Dixon, pastor of St. Peter, which
has been burglarized 16 times in
the last 18 months and was one
of the four churches hit over the
weekend.

Network cuts affect
'88 election coverage

RADNOR, Pa. —— Network
budget cuts and technological ad-
vances that are bringing more lo-
cal stations inta the picture are
dramatically changing the rules of
televison’s coverage for 1988
elections, a published report says.

The networks can no longer af-
ford the luxury of the exhaustive,
one—on-one coverage of candi-
dates, according to a report in the
Oct. 31 issue of TV Guide.

Traditionally, a crew composed
of a correspondent, a producer
and sound and camera crews
track each major candidate from

dawn to dusk.

At the corner of Forbes and
Bigelow, there is no four-way

23 seconds to cross Forbes.
If someone is crossing
Bigelow _(walking from the
Cathedral to the Pitt Union for
example), traffic continues
from Forbes or from either
direction on Bigelow.

Pitt employee Linda Kaplan
said of jaywalking, "It's one
of the laws on the books that
I don't worry about." And
her co-worker, Tara Slaugh-

Motorists don't take too

Forbes, heedless of the red
light which was supposed to
regulate his driving habits.

With whom are we

competing, really?

The Central Blood Bank began its annual Pitt-Penn State Blood
Drive yesterday, and it might just be a good idea to get involved.
There are a number of things at stake. ' '

First, there are the people who need the blood. We've all
heard too many times the blood we give could help someone
we love. We've heard the gripping stories of the pint of blood
that couldhave saved a life. It's easy to sloganize each other’s
needs. V

The important point is it doesn't matter who gets the blood,
it doesn't make any difference that the donor might know the

. recipient.

There will be accidents. People will need blood to survive.
That, in itself, should be sufficient motivation to give. Sadly
though, it is not. V _

The Pitt-Penn State Blood Drive, hopefully, will encourage
people to begin thinking about the need for blood, rather than
the value of being better than another school. I

The donation of blood should indeed be a competition, but
not with another group ofdonors. It should be competition with
the huge and growing demand for blood.

Whatever your motivation though, please take part in this
blood drive. And in the next. It costs nothing more than 45
minutes, and we all certainly have at least that much time to
serve so great a cause.

In a nutshell 

If there is poetry in my
book about the sea, it is not
because I deliberately put
it there, but because no
one could write truthfully
about the sea and leave out
the poetry.

mentalist, thinker)

Letters! I actually got letters!
Here they are, in the order in
which they arrived, not the ord-
er of importance.

The advertisements concerning
”Jeans Day” placed in The Pitt
News were morally deceptive.
Wednesday,‘ The Naked City
mentioned signs which read ”At—
tention!!! If you are gay, or sup-
port gay rights, wear your blue
jeans on Wednesday, Oct. 21
I saw no such signs, only articles
in The Pitt News that simply stat-
ed ”Jeans Day this Wednesday.”
many of the people who wore
jeans on Wednesday were de-

~ ceived into believing that Wed-

nesday, Oct. 21, was just a day
to celebrate jeans, when it was
actually a device to fool people
into falsely celebrating homosex-

-uality. I'm appalled by the actions

of this, so called, alliance to resort
to deception as a means to gain
support. Most, if not all, of the
people that I am affiliated with
routinely wear jeans; Wednesday
was no different- for those who
were unaware of what ”Jeans

_ Day” was all about. The Gay and

Lesbian Alliance should have
chosen a symbol, such as an arm
band, which is ordinarily not
worn without a purpose, to
represent those who support its
cause. I .

I refuse to recognize any or-
ganization that undermines the
naivete of the public. This ”sup-

port” that GALA believes to have‘

gained is purely false. How can
any organization expect to gain
support and respect without be-
ing honest with those people
from whom it seeks support and
respect? I think that an honest
event would have more effective-
Iy reached the goals of the GALA.

has gone. Jeans Day was spon-
sored by the University of Pitts-
burgh Gay and Lesbian Alliance
on Oct. 21, 1987. It was first
thought of many years ago, and
it has been an active gay event at
‘many colleges nationwide such
as Princeton, Harvard, UCLA and
Cornell. This year, Pitt and CMU
joined in with their support. It is
designed for two things. The first
is to say I'm gay and proud to
show it, or the second is to say
I support gay people. All you had
to do to" participate was wear
your jeans. Simple as that!
We, the members of Pitt GALA,
would like to thank all the gay
students, who helped make Jeans

Day ‘a success! We would also —

like to thank all the other students
on campus, who knowingly or
unknowingly showed their sup-
port for the event! A
With the success of this event
we would like to consider repeat-
ing this event next term. Watch
for the posters for details. Next
time we only ask that you wait
until after the event before you
tear the poster down for a
souvenir.

know, Kevin Garrin graduated
from Pitt last Spring. A few weeks
after that, he died in an apartment
fire. He was 23.

walked in front of the building
where Kevin Garrin died last
Spring. The house is all boarded
up now, and the air surrounding
it still smells faintly of smoke. I
stopped and just looked. ”Some-

THE PITT NEWS

By Sam Tallarico
Sports Editor

The Pitt women's tennis team
hit a few obstacles toward the
close of the season, but they were
able to regroup and end the year
‘on a high note. '

After placing ninth in the Big
East tournament at Seton Hall
University, the Lady Panthers
traveled to Clarion, where they
were shut out 9-0. Pitt turned it
around 9 in the season _finale
against Carnegie Mellon, winning
6-3.

In the Big East tournament, the
Lady Panthers came away with
only three points. Carrie deVera,
Pitt's No. 2 singles seed, won by
default when her opponent-,
Tracey Longo of Seton Hall, was

injured and unable to start the
match. Pitt was awarded’ one.
. point.for that match.

”When you have nine teams,
you will have a wrinkle in the
draw. That match was the wrin-
kle,” said head coach George
Dieffenbach. ‘ ‘

Pitt's No. 6 seed, Sandy Hunt,

~ accounted for the team's other

two points when she defeated
Lisa Robinson of Syracuse 7-6,
6-4. 9

Against a talented Clarion
team,‘the Lady Panthers lost all
matches played in straight sets.
The third doubles seed, consist-
ing of Sue Bononno and Sandy
Hunt, was not played because
Hunt injured herself during her
singles match. She was unable to

finish that singles match, thereby

forfeiting the match. 4
Against CMU, the Lady Pan-

thers were able to avenge the loss

handed to them by the Lady Tar-

tans in the first match of the year.

Tracy Feltingoff and deVera got
the match rolling with victories
over Sue Dottor 6-2, 6-2, and
Beth Cavanough _7-5, 4,-6, 6-3,
respectively.

CMU’s Andrea Benowitz and»

Amy Fibus came back with vic-
tories 'against Pitt's third- and

-fourth—see_ded players, Bonnie

Kartzman and Gwen Mclntyre
6-1, 6-2, and 6-3, 6-3.

Pitt's Sharon Jaffee defeated
Tracy Boyd 6-3, 6-3, while team-
mate Sandy Hunt disposed of
Alice Garber 6-1, 6-3..

In the doubles matches, CMU’s
Dottor and Cavanough defeated
Feltingoff and Kartzman 6-1, 7-6.
DeVera and Mclntyre rebounded
to defeat Benowitz and Garber
6-3, 7-5, while Jaffee and Jill Co-
hen defeated CMU’s Fibus and
Boyd 6-3, 6-1.

' ’’It was terrific to start off the
season losing a close match 5-4
[against CMU]. We progressed
through much of the season play-
ing strong schools,”. said
Dieffenbach.

”We wanted to do well in the
B'ig'East. We played in the Big
East championships, then we had
the match with Clarion. All the
players were up for CMU.

’’It was 4-2 after the singles
matches at CMU. When Carrie
deVera was in the middle of her

set, we were up 3-2. That was im-
portant that she won, otherwise
the score could have been differ-
ent. Sharon and Jill's doubles
match clinched it.”

Whatthat match also clinched
was the tennis team's first 10—win
season (10-6) since 1975, the first
year women played tennis at Pitt.
The 1975 recordfwas 12-5.

As for Dieffenbach, it was the
most wins for him in his career
as a women's coach at Pitt, which
dates back to 1981. His 1984

- squad was 9-5.

», For the singles players, their
season records were: Feltingoff
(8-8), deVera (10-N8), Kartzman
(8-10), Mclntyre '(9-9), Jaffee
(10-8), Hunt (13-5) and Cohen
(2-0).

’’If you look at the records, you
can see between deVera, Jaffee
and Hunt, they had 33 singles
wins. That's always important for
half of your players have a win-
ning record,” Dieffenbach said.

”Throughout the season, our
players were up and down, but
each player came through during

the season‘ at one point or‘

another. Special credit goes to de-

6- Vera, Jaffee and Hunt for their

winning record,” he added.

PANTHER NQJES: For four ‘of

the Lady Panthers, the season will '

last a little longer. Gwen Mcln-
tyre, Carrie deVera, Tracy Feltin-
goff and Sharon Jaffee will
compete in the ITCA Eastern In-
door,Championships on Nov. 6

Mark Malone is learning the
football lesson that Cliff Stoudt,

' David Woodley and Scott Camp-

bell know all too well. ltfs tough
to quarterback in the same town
where Terry Bradshaw led -the

. Pittsburgh Steelers to four Super

  

Bowl titles. ' -

Malone, in his fourth season as

the Steelers’ QB, has become the
city's most‘ disliked, discussed
and‘ cussed sports figure since
Stoudt succeeded the popular
Bradshaw in 1983. The Steelers’
‘6-1 0 and 7-9 records the last two
seasons haven't helped, nor did
Ma|one’s miniscule, NFL’-low
17.2 quarterback rating in his two
prestrike games.

That's why the chorus of boos
that echoed through Three Rivers
Stadium when Malone ran on the

field for Sunday's game against-

the Cincinnati Bengals had noth-
ing to do with Halloween.

’’It didn't make my job any eas- "

‘ier, and it didn't make the team.’s
any easier,” Malone said.

Malone hasn't silenced the fans

fused to criticize them — so.he’s

  Malonedoesn’t let fans bring him down

Malone recovered in the second 
half Sunday to rally the Steelers
to a 23-20 victory over the .‘

Bengals.

Malone, completing 18 of 3.0“ b
passes for 218 yards, tied the
score at 20-20 with _a 12—yard..
scoring pass to John Stallworth, 
then set up Gary Anderson's win- 
ning ‘field goal with a 45-yard}

completion to Stallworth.

’’It’s not easy when theworld 
is against you, and it's a. shame,“
that’s_ the way it is,” Steelers‘ '
Coach Chuck Noll said. ’’It rea|"- 
ly is. But maybe it's _a picture of 
how we're going as a society.f7
One thing is certain, though, and 
that's you're not going to be per- 

fect. No one is.” -

The booing was long and loudf"«y
every time Malone stepped on_ 
the field. Some fans ‘chanted;
”Malone Go Home,” and others ,
displayed a signthat read ”Ma- 

lone, Stay on Strike.”

_ ’’One of the guys on» the;
grounds crew told me I was go-'‘‘‘
ing to need ear plugs,” Malone -
said. ’’I knew it was going to hap-_~."‘g.

No, the strike wasn't a bad

dream, but it also isn't in illusion
that the striking NFL players have

' finally succumbed to the owners’

. , power-play tactic of repla_cement

games and have gone back to
their hut-one, hut-two jobs.

It's easy to see that nothing was
gained, and much was lost by this

exercise in futility. Thousands

and thousands of dollars worth of
players’ salaries vaporized. The

invaluable cohesiveness that
clubs need to be successful in a
p|ay—for—pay league deteriorated
with the crossing of picket lines
by veterans and rookies alike.
But, most importantly, any in-
tegrity and respect that the Na-
tional Football League Players
Association (  and the key word
here is indeed ”Association”

ion had its members negotiate in-

It must be understood that what
the players really tried to accom-
plish was within reason when
considering the nature of their oc-
cupation: lessening of injuries, a
reasonable pension, health care
and some form ofjob security. In

‘ mulative trauma and stress adds

up to a life expectancy that is be-
lieved to average 55 years, as
compared with 70 for American
men in general. This is a group
of men who work in a field in
which the high injury rate has

’ reduced the average career to 3.5

years, [men] whose counterparts
in basketball (3.8 years) and base-
ball (4.9 years) earn about twice
their average salary of $230,000
a year and several times their
pension benefits.

”And what is to become of the
players when their careers are
concluded? They join the ranks of

i the walking wounded.

_”[For the owners] it is not

difficult to replace injured play-
ers — colleges grow a whole new
crop each year at no cost to the
NFL." »
0 The players pinpointed the is-
sue of free agency as their war-
head. ”We want to play for the
team of our choice,” the players
cried. ’’People who aren't in
professional sports can work in
whatever city they want. Why
can't we? And free agency didn't
destroy baseball, like the owners
Claim!”

Not entirely true. If one
chooses to join the Army, Navy
or Marines, the general consen-
sus is that he doesn't get stationed

in sunny St. Martin strictly upon
request — he goes where the‘
commandant sendshim, even
though suggestions of preferred
locale are sometimes considered.
In the NFL, it's called the draft
and ”trade me, please.” Football
fans weren't sympathetic toward
this ’’I want to play for high-
paying Al Davis” reason for walk-
ing out, and so the replacement
games were supported more than
anyone really anticipated.

0 Gene Upshaw. The guy
comes off like the radical, my-
way-or-the-highway type. Seeing
this man spout off at management
in his outspoken, arrogant ap-
proach tends to really turn the

everyday sho_t—and—a—beer sports
fans off, especially when the
teams hit the pickets during a soft
spot called the regular season. A
more pleasant disposition on Up-
shaw’s part just might win his
cause some non—Association
support. I

0 The non-Assocation pickets.
The Wildcats and the USWA and
the UMW and the AFL—CIO — all
sorts of union factions came out
and supported the striking play-
ers’ cause at those ”scab” games
and practices. The intelligentsia,
i.e. those who saw through the
absolute inanity of any union
support (which in some light
could be interpreted as ”kissing

up to their pro football heroes”),
know quite well that the NFLPA
would probably be the second to
last group (behind the Gene Up-
shaw Fan Club) to picket along-
side a striking USWA or UMW or
International Ladies Garment
Workers Union. The real, hard-
core union attitude just wouldn't
be there for that type of gung-ho
union activism; hence, the play-

ers would read about it in the

papers.

Now the NFLPA has no choice
but to regroup while taking the
embarassment of returning to

work without a new contract. By‘

mistakes, they certainly have
learned.

Noll feels fourth quarter key to success   off

By Alan Robinson
AP Sports Writer

The Pittsburgh Steelers are 4-2
and tied for the AFC Central Di-
vision lead after winning only
one of their first six games last
season. Coach Chuck Noll says a
successful replacement team isn't

' the only reason for the big im-

provement.
Not only were the Steelers’

replacements 2-1, but their regu-
lars are, too, after returning from
the 24-day NFL strike Sunday to
beat AFC Central Division rival
Cincinnati 23-20.

Noll said Monday the victory
was significant because the Steel-
ers rallied from behind to win in
the fourth quarter, something
they never did last year during a
6-10 season.

”|t’s essential to play well in the

fourth quarter because in the NFL
that's where games are won and
lost. The good teams are the
teams that play well in the fourth
quarter,” Noll said.

Noll also was pleased the Steel-
ers’ defense continued its pre-
strike trend of creating the big
play. The defense forced two tur-
novers and scored a touchdown,
its third in three games, on Bryan
Hinkle’s interception and lateral
to Delton Hall.

The Steelers and their replace-
ments have forced 19 turnovers

' in six games, although 14-year

veteran Donnie Shell is the only
returning starter from a year ago
in the defensive secondary.
Although many of their regulars
were playing their first game in a
month Sunday, the Steelers didn't
commit a turnover.

”We’re a little more physical

STOP-STANDING IN LINES
TRY US

THE copv STOP

football team than we were last
season, especially on defense,”
Noll said. ”We’ve been a big
play defense, and that's the key
to the whole thing. We're better

' there than we were last year,

much better. Our secondary is
significantly better.”

Delton Hall, a rookie from
Clemson, and Dwayne Wood-
ruff, who missed the 1986 season
with a serious knee injury, are the
cornerbacks, and Shell and
rookie" Thomas Everett are the
safeties.

Hall, a second-round draft
choice who had anlinterception
return TD in the Steelers’ season-

opening game, has scored two
touchdowns in only three NFL
games.

”Hall is the kind of cornerback
we were looking for,” Noll said.
”He has the ability to run, cover

and hit..He’s big, strong and fast _

II

and is learning the position.

Noll, whose weekly news con-
ferences are carried live over a
Pittsburgh radio station, also de-
livered a mini-lecture to Steelers’
fans. Noll remains unhappy that
quarterback Mark Malone was
booed repeatedly — often at a
very high volume —— before
directing the Steelers’ fourth-
quarter rally.

”Our guys were talking about
it  the anger that was directed
at Mark and the way he stood in

there like a champ and took it,” ' I

Noll said. ”|t’s better than people
sitting on their hands. As far as
our players are concerned, if the
fans areinto it and going after it_,

-it excites them. But what hap-

pened here is tougher than play-
ing on the road. On the road, you
expect everybdoy to be against
us.

”But I hope the fans remember
that we’re'not just the Steelers,
we're the Pittsburgh Steelers, and

_ we'd like to keep it the Pittsburgh
Steelers. They're part of it, too.” «
