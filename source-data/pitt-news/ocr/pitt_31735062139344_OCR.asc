VALUE OF-A COLLEGE I
_ EDUCATION ESTIMATED

Q

A college ' education is worth
$25,000, accordingto statistics com-i
piled by the administration ofﬁce of
Northwestern _University and made
public today. In -seeking to prove in
dollars and cents the value of a
higher education, the university took a
census of the class of 1903, members
of. which have had ten. years_to get
“settled.” , — ' v

 

The investigation showed that for’
- the ﬁrst ﬁve years out of school the

average earning power of the grad-

_uates was $867 and for the next ﬁve‘
 years the earning capacity jumped
- to‘ $1,862. *“’ T ‘

‘ . “According to the United States cen-
sus bureau the average earning ca-
.pacity of the-salaried man in Chicago

, is. $1,202. An estimate of the‘ actual

value of acollege education was ar-
'rived at by ﬁnding the diﬁerence be-_
tween. the -earnings of the graduate
and the.report of the government

~ census and’ multiplying the sum by
" ~40, which the statistician considered a

"fair estimate. of a .man’s years of ser-

U _ ‘’ Permanent Secretary

.:__:—-

 ~. GEORGEM.-»P.B:AIRD.

In a repor_1:_ on the organization meet-
ing. of the Association of Alumni» Sec-
retaries held at*Columbus, Ohio," last
February, Professor Alexander Silver-
.man, Secretary of the Alumni Associa-
tion, and delegate to the‘ convention
mentioned recommended the appoint-
‘ment of a permanent secretary to look
after the .interests of the association, be-
‘caiise of therremarkable progress there
’ ‘reported, by permanent secretaries Shaw,
of Michigan, _Compton of Columbia,
Prescott of Louisiana, Johnston of Min-
nesota, Warwick of Ohio State and otli
ers.‘ Realizing that the Department 0
Cheiiiistry was constantly demanding
more of his time, Professor Silverman
offered to resign- from the secretaryship
as soon as the association could afford
to secure someone who could devote his
entire time and thus.better advance the
interests of’ the Alumni ~Association.
Professor Silverman has been secretary
of the General Alumni Association since
its organization in 1907, having been re-
elected annually by a practically unani-
mous vote. He has been a most im-
portant factor in the association’s‘ pro-
gress and,development, and a steady
growth was maintained under his direc-
tion. According to the constitution, he
will necessarily'remain secretary until
‘February 27, 1914, though the services
of Mr. George M. P. Baird, ’09, have
i already been secured. Mr. Baird is at
present co—operatin.g with Professor Sil-
I verman but is expected to give his. entire
A ‘time to the .association beginning Sep-
tember I, 1913. '
The Alumni are very. fortunate ‘in
their selection of Mr. Baird, whowas
"always prominent in undergraduate ac-
tivities and‘ who’ has been one of the

6

8

. hardest Woi=k-ers ,e'ver elected to the

Alumni Council. His songsters are
known to practically every Pitt man be
‘ he alumnus or student. -Mr. Baird will
be a‘ big help to both when he locates
on thecampus this fall. '
George Mahaffey Patterson ‘Baird is a
Pittsburgher. by birth. He graduated
from the ‘Avalon borough schools in 1903
and Avalon High School in I905, enter-
‘ing the University of Pittsburgh, then
old W. U. P.,- inthe fall of the same
year. In 1906 and 1909 Mr. Baird was
- a member of the Debating Team; from
I906 to I908 editor of the “Courant,” in
. ~I909 editor of _the “Owl ;” from 1907 to
1909 accredited tutor *in"Literature and
.Rhetoric’ and “Student Reader" in the
Department of English; in .1909 he de-
li»ver"ed the “Spoon Oration.” Mr.) Baird
was a member of the Philoniethe«an Lit-
erary Societyvand Classical Club, and a
charter member of the Pitt Y. M. C.{A.
‘and Science Club. During the Summer
7 Terms of 1908 and'I9o9 he was inst'ruc-
tor in English and History and in 1910
‘ «did postgraduate‘ workin both subjects.

.3
I

1

.. He has been a member of the General

‘Alumni. Association since 1909 and in
1911 wagelected to the Aliimni Council,
where he has served actively ever since.

In 1910 Mr.» Baird was Supervisor of
‘Night ‘Schools of M:cKees Rod<s bor-
ough; during 1910 and 1911 Publicity
Secretary and Director of "ithe Men’s De-
partment of the Associated Charities of
Pittsburgh; from I9II to 1913 Director
of Work for Boys at the- Irene Kauf-
mann Settlement.‘ He is a member of
the Pittsburgh Housing Conference, was’
secretary of the Social Workers,~C1ub of
Pittsburgh from 1911 to 1913, Secretary
of the Hungry Club of Pittsburgh 1910-
II and is now a member of its Execu-
tive Board.' He is also a member of the
Pittsburgh ~Single Tax Club and the
Contemporary Club.
if Mr. Baird is a, poet of enviable repu-
tation. Only recently at a banquetiin
New York City, while introducing Alfred
Noyes, the coming Poet Laureate of
England, Mr. Andrew Carnegie read Mr.
Baird’s poem, “War Flags,” as .a high
example of modern American poetry.‘
R The Alumni Association, Student Body
and University have every cause to con-
gratulate themselves for having secured
the services of so valuable a man.

 

MR. I3AIRD’S “ANNATES OF A
SONG” AND QTHER POEMS

 

‘Last Chsistmas there‘ were printed
for privateeirculation abouttwenty
{poems by Mr.’ George Biaird, under the
title “Annates of Song.’_’ The Brochure
was dedicated to Mr. J. J. O’Connor,
College, 1910, and was published only
for private circulation among the
friends of the author. Persons who
received a copy had a two-fold pleas-
ure: that of being admitted to the
intimate thoughts of .a man whom
they esteem, and that of recognizing
poettiic talent ‘and character. The
present is not a suitable‘ occasion for
a studied estimate of Mr. *~Baird’s
poetry, but is peculiarly appropriate
for a few words of friendly apprecia-

tion and of cordial_encouragement.

As is welcome in the work of a
young ,poet, the contents of this
brochure, ‘are miscellaneous.‘ A wide
range of interests is disclosed. Social
service and social -justice, political
«reform, friendship, nature,’ the Uni-
versity, religious faith, the quest of
the higher beauty-—these are the prin-
cipal themes. . This range of interests.
is of the happiest augury. Poetry
draws its life from experience, and
experience is-always in the present
tense; but on the other hand, leader-
ship and inspiration are with those
who unite many veins of thought.
Social workers who have no vision’
beyond the betterment of material
conditions‘ achieve no lasting results.
If Carlyle was right ( and he surely
was) in saying that the poet who can
only sit in a chair and compose
stan“zas is no poet, he might have
added with lequal justice that the
social philosopherwho has no touch
of the poet _is’.a melancholy spe-c-tacle.
Mr. Baird has devoted his life, since
his graduation, to the work of la
social settlement- In consequence of
such experience, idealism must either
die or ﬂourish with renewed life; she
has no choice of the dreamy irre-
sponsible existence that is possible
-in the case‘ of her academic votaries.
Mr. Baird's idealism has vigor ‘and
courage. It has taken strength from
intimate knowledge of the needs of
humanity. -

Though the contents of this publi-
cation are varied, a distinctive im-
pression is imparted‘ by poems that
arise from the social sympathies of
the author. Among the titles of this
group are some vigorous c-oniposi-
tions that call for special mention.
“Thy People Pray” expresses the need
‘of justice; “Mother Against Minotaur”
boldly applies the Greek myth to the

pliesfit with notablepartistic power
-and economy; “A Social Settlement”

o

"of the politics of this state.

Baird belongs, to’ the tradition of

“expresses the spirit of the service he

social -evil in modern times, and ap-ﬂ

.happy- future for the

.strikes accurately a. notie of com-.
, . . . H H .

radeship; ‘and “A Drifting Ship” (Penn-
sylvania) is a bitterly radical view
In the
City is a vivid representation of the
contrasts of, fortune, the material
strength and moral shames, "the glofy
and weakness of the great industrial
towns of America.

Whatever his political .or “socio-
logical convictions may be, every wise
man rejoices in ,the, application of
the spirit of poetry to politics andto
society., Both poetry and politics
have everything to gain from the ap-
plication. ‘The cure for the visionary
idealism is the practical idealism, not
thesurrender of all idealism; and the
cure for base politics and the _nar-
row politics is ennobled politics, per-
haps eyen poetized politics. Mr.

Ruskin and of William Morris, though
it would be an. injustice to assign to
him’ the special economic. creed of
either. The~spi‘rit of protest against
selﬁsh materialism we can all share,
differ as we may in its manifestations.
That spirit Mr. Baird expresses in
a poem later than the collection un-
der review, which may well be quoted

entire: . A
‘ APRAYER.’

“O give.us strength to face our day
With courage, as Thy sons of old,
To lift our voice in prophecies
Against the gods of stone and gold:
Give us to see and understand -
Theheartl of man and to fcirgivej .
Give us ‘the faith to touch Thy hand,

Teach us, O.-gentle Lord, to live. _, ..

Amen.” I

_Many Universities are already fa-
miliar ‘with Mr. Baird's ‘poems on
University subjects, and all »who do
not know them should make their
acquaintance. This collection contains
Alma Mater, writtengfor the 125th
anniversary, and a second poemvvith
the same title and the sub-title, A

latter is an epitome of one”aspect——
and that not the least noble—of the
history of the institution—the com-
paratively unrecognized ‘and unre-
warded service of“ the University
throughout a long tract of her history.
“O Thou who treadst with valiant ‘feet

The rugged road of hostileyears,
Whose lot hath been the gleaned ear

Snatched from a world. of-garnere -

Every Pitt man is a well-wisher
of George Baird. By virtue of his?
new ofﬁce Mr. Baird will be the most
active intermediary between the pres- ,
ent generation of students and teach- L
ers and the graduates of the insti-
tution. We believe" that ,his “poetry

will render -in the new ﬁeld. And
we desire that the renewed bond with
Alma Mater may inspire, .not only
activity, but poetry.

How long these hours, how weari-

’Il‘HI-S'Y1i::ARi,
Today imarkes another epoch in

the annals of “Old Uni” with the close
of this year we place page 127 in

‘the biography of a ﬂourishing insti-

tution. Ahdilike all books it is not
always a. volume of 'comics nor of
ﬁction although thereading of it
does not always flow along like a
song with ‘the beautyof plot of the
Jack London type, we ﬁnd a consola-
tion that there is logic in it all.

‘ Wherever there has been something

done whether it was _pleasant or not
there was Pitt spirit .behind_f1t all,
and that is the thing that brings ’us
through many a battle,

At the beginning ‘of the year we

. enrolled the largestenumber of stu-

dents in.‘ our history; 2700 and some
in all; a decided contrast between the
ﬁrst class consisting of three students
and even eight'years ago when the
enrollment was 812. Almost every
country on the’ globe is represented
in the University, each -taking ‘back
to his home and country the educa-
tion and culture that. old Pitt gives
to them. ' - ' — , '

Financially we have had the great-
est year -of our history. Thegifts
of the Parks~family and the Mellons
amounting to $600,000. At present a
bill in the ‘State Legislature, has
passed’ the house_and is in the hands
of'the Senate. This appropriation
Will’ be $1,000,000 or more if the bill
is not altered before it is signed by
the Governor. With such amounts
as these on hand the University is
at the close of a banner year. The
student debts amounting to about
$1,500 in all have in a great measure
been‘ liquidated or deﬁnite plans made

STYLE OF PITT WEEKLY
V ' ' TO CHANGE

Among other changes that the stu-
dents will ﬁnd upon their return. next
fall will be an alteration in the
WEEKLY. ‘It was decided atvthe last
meeting of the Board’ to increase the
size of the paper to meet the demands.-
It is the plan to print a paper of six col-
umns, each page containing about the
same space as the average city daily
newspaper. The style of paper will be
the same as that upon which all dailies
are printed. ' ' ,

 

CLASS DAY ”
Thea traditional Class Day exer ises
revived by the graduating class was a
most commendable affair and those in
charge’ deserve great credit for _their un-
tiring efforts to make it .a success, How-
ever, in one sense, and this was due to
the ‘undergraduates, it ‘was unsuccessful.
As one visitor» said, it seemed like a high
school affair in that the students did not
get into the spirit of it. There is no
doubt that this was the state" of _alfairs,
for the sacredness of the tradition was
sidetracked and the “rough stuff” sub-
stituted. ‘This does ‘not mean that all
fun should be abolished, but it means
that there should be a limit to the hi-lar—\
itv. Would it not be better to hold the
“Spoon Oration” on 'a_ separate occasion
and make it a traditional'°day_ of fun or
solemnity, but"surely not a heterogenous

 

mixture of both elements in which
neither predominates. '

one of the greatest and moﬁ “pro-
gressive universities of the country.
You are in a position therefore to

To Next Year’s Seniors

You have made a ﬁne record as
juniors. Your OWL was the best we
have ever seen; your “PROM” was a
model which other universities would
do well to follow. ‘Co‘ntinue"in the
way you have begun. "Let your senior

uates that they show more‘ Pitt spirit

To Next Year’s Juniors. /

As sophomores you\ were a dismal _.

failure. You forgot that tlfere were

freshmen around. . You forgot-‘ that’
it was your duty to see that the fresh-j

men obeyed the campus rules." You
allowed them to stray away from the
"cheering section intotthe gran stand
last fall and you permitted t em to
be absent from the baseball games
this spring. As juniors yop must re-
deem yourselves. Pitt promotes
progress.

Therefore we can have a‘

still better OWL and a ‘more en-‘A

joyable “PROM,” but you must wake
up if you wis to .keep in_ line with
the progressive spirit of Pitt.

To Next Year’s Sophomores.

You have made an enviable record
during your ﬁrst year-at Pitt. "You
got into the real spirit _-of the Uni-
versity from the*start." You organ-
ized the cadet corps, you placed men
on both the editorial and business

staffs of the.PITT WEEKLY, you '

were represented on the debating
team, the varsity football team, the
swimming team, the track team, the

baseball. team, the basket ball team, .

the band, the Musical clubs, the Cap

& Gown club, the wrestling team and 7

many othervstudent activities. Be

“ , careful next year thatyou do no; fall

into the error of this year's sopho-H

ception committee of “sophs” will "be
on hand to fwelcdme you the ﬁrst

The following statement was received

publication : '

‘,‘I understand there is some serious
dissatisfaction among the girl students
because of certain articles referring to
them in the I914-Owl. I have taken

this matter up with members of both.

societies and have tried to meet with the
girls’ executive committee to explain
that the article was not written by‘ any
member of the board,.and was stricken
from the proof because it did not ex-
press the sentiments of the class or the
board. Because its appearance was a
“printer’s error” a-nd because in the_mis-

One of the. biggest questions that had to

Naturally in presenting to your the men
worthy of note as -dope handlers, hot-air
manufacturers. ibullers, stal-lers, etc., I ﬁrst
bring to your not too kind attention our
own Prlxie Bull. Percy-Ismertz. His.spec-
ialty is conducting class meetings. There
are usually at least three persons there.
He starts off with, “The meetilng will
please come to order.” ',This nothaving
the desired effect he gets real stern and
serious and says, “This meetings gotta
come t-o order,_ that's all.” Then we all‘
get scared and comparative peace reigns.

Next comes our esteemed noise man, A.
P. Wright of the ~tennis -team. He is vice
president. Now you don't know. what the
A. .P. stands for. It means AlLWAYlS
-PUDLI-‘NG. To see him and hear him talk
you'd never suspect that he is deep enough
to be a. miner. He's over 21 too. ‘Still he

one Prof. in the entire school wh-o has been
able to get him to hand in the work as-
signed even approximatewrl on time. That
is our “Teddy Roosevelt” Williams. who
teaches Journalism. But then maybe

"J, ' H. Giesey, - the architect has

Memorial hall, the Pittsburgh Athletic
association, and "the proposed new
Masonic temple. The new building

.carries the ancient Greek linesof archi-
tecture, with an exterior of granite‘,
terra-cotta, and cream-colored brick.
The center of the building will face
Thackeray .ave., and this thorough—_
fate will. lead directly into. the main
entrance. Instead of the customary
steps, the teﬁrace will be cut away and
the,sidewal '-extended to the front‘
line of" the building, level with the
ﬂoor. W 1,’ ~’ . 
A unique feature in connection with
the plans for the new. building, and
one "that emphasizes thejirnportance
of -the school, is the fact that all ﬂoors
will be laid with a composition more
serviceable than concrete, and im-
pervious to acids. This ﬂoor com-

-uosition, was discovered and perfected
by the Industrial Research Labora-
tory of the Institute. ‘

Plans provide for a main entrance,
hall’ of classical desigig with _a wide
‘stairway’-leading to the upper ﬂoors.
The basement will house electrical

and other experimental furnaces, and,

large sqale apparatus,‘ machine shop
and boiler rooms.’ The ﬁrst ﬂoor will
contain the general oﬂices and lecture‘
hall with a seating "capacity of 400.

The upper floors will be devoted to_

laboratory and .}'e‘search work: ,
The building will... be heated by a_
‘hot water system, and the most mod-

-Charicellor“ McCormick,‘ though

hampered by lack of time, due to the
length of the exercises, was able to
condense his sermon .eifectively -into
a short‘ half hour without diminishing
in the least its vigor and persuasive-
ness. He chojse as his text Matthew
, “Render therefore» "unto

Caesar jtheiithings which are Caes'ar’s;

G'od"s.” He, said in part:
are -equally _esse'I1tvi.al_—a ¢m£in’S_. duty
to his sta-te and "to his Creator. But
‘I have taken’ the first part of *the‘text
as Ava basis fo.r this sermon on The
Nation’s' Challenge to the College
Man.’ ” i ' .
Dr. McCormick then treated’ ‘at
length the modern economic‘, social
and political problems which’ the
nation must solve, and f0}'.Wh0S€
solution she loo to -the rising gen-
eration of college men. ‘
“The qualities which are demanded
now above all others,” the said‘; “are

service for humanity, and eﬂiciency,

which is synonymous with brain-
power.” ' -  . »

At the close of the sermon the
graduating 'class arose and Dr. Mc-
Cormick iaddressed his closing re-
marks -to’ them, making _a powerful

‘appeal ‘for personal responsibility as

CIVIC CLUB Ei.EbTs‘ OFFICERS

d'iscussed——lately,' formed a, deﬁnite or-

the following students were favored with
ofﬁces: President, W; H. Allen, Econ.

. ’i5; vice president, Chas. Slavens, Econ.

’I4; secretary, John Harmon, _Econ.- ’I4;
executive committee, C. P. Powell, Econ.

Schenck, ‘Econ. ’I4. This club will make
the 18th chapter of the National Civic
Club, which has chapters in the big uni,-
versities like Pennsylvania, Columbia,
‘New York University and others.

The object ofthe club is tovtake up
civic problems, as drainage, public works,
housing, etc., and discuss means of bet-
tering the present conditions. Conven-
tions .are held every year, and students
from all the schools present the ideas
worked out in their ‘respective clubs. 

Pittsburgh is an’ ‘ideal location for

such a club as these civic problems pre-

sent themselves daily, and” afford much
opportunityfor practical study. ‘ .

‘ The Pitt Civic Club" will begin" its
meetings nextjyear, and the work will
be taken up as soon as possible. --

in cash $196.39 to ether with several
dollars in pledges. he sum would have

I , Camp To Be Established ,
I-_.;.Never ‘during, its existence has the

 University of_ﬁPittsburgh had a brighter
« outlook for developing a varsity team,

than is before it this coming season.

The) new coaching system, which
includes ,-a Head Coach (J. M. Duff
of Pi-inceton)i and an assistant coach,

-' (E. H. W.‘ “Nubs” Harlan) ‘is. to be
'a great improvement on the old crude

methlod of handling the foot ball'ma-
teria . ' ’ -
In regard to the new foot ball men

H‘ A that are l-ined up‘-to enter the Uni-
- versity, it isenoughto say that these

men have "stable foundationsion which
will stamp
their seal of ‘guarantee. Tl “

That lack ‘which has haiidicaped
“the teami in the previous years will

_ -be overcome.this_ year by the est_ab—_
‘lishment of a training camp at Wim-

--ber, Paa, which will open the first of
and ‘last all during that
month.‘ ' 7 f '

Any ‘new men entering the Uni-
versity‘ at the.~beginning of the Fall
term; who are able to show that they

' are Varsity material by getting under
' ‘the instruction of the Freshman foot

ball co_ach, will be sent to the train-
‘ ing camp. A ' A ‘
The entire list of last year’s letter
men who will be in the University
next year will be taken to the farm
and rounded intoshape. Most of the
men will be back in uniform by the
beginning of next September, and
many new men ;will be brought out
when the fall term opens. From pres-
ent estimates there will be about four
teams on the ,ﬁel"d every day in
practice. ‘ ,
_An expansive policy has been adopt-
ed at Pitt in respect to arranging
schedules, and the plan of cutting out
many of the smaller institutions here-
toforet met in athletic contests and
going after the ‘ibig fellows” will be
followed more closely than ever next
year. This is shown in the 1913 foot-
-ball card, which includes more large
games than ever before—-in fact, with

- the exception of the Ohio Northern

university‘ game,-September 27, all
are hard games. The most import-
ant are with Lafeyette, Penn State,
I W. &,J., Carlisle Indians and Bucknell,
in‘ Pittsburgh, and with Cornell uni-
versity and Annapolis, away from
home.

MARSHALL IS ELECTED ,
. *   cA1>TAiM.0T.TEAeM TEAM

Matt‘ Marshall, .ho1der'of the Uni-
versity half mile record, was elected
captain of next year’s varsity: track
team, defeating McKinney for the
honor.by one vote.‘ Marshall was
a, star in his Freshman year winning
every race he entered. However _it
is hoped’ that the new honor will
spur him on to many more notable
cinder path victories. ’ it _
~ With the exception of the splendid
victory over Lafeyette college the
season has not been very fortunate
for the wearers‘of the Blue'& Gold.
Only in this méet did the team dis-
play its ability. The defeat in the
dual meet at Washington cameas a
big surprise, as Pitt easily won the
year before. The team, man for man,
is better than before, but the compe-
tition has been stronger all around,
so Pitt may have this consolation for
its apparent failure. ‘

The,prospe::ts for next year are
very bright. ,,,Of the 13 men who hpve
been awarded. their letter this “year
all will be in school next year ex-
cept “Polly” Galvin who graduates
from the Dental school. In addition
to these, there are many others who
with a _little more practice will give
a good account of themselves, as well
as several scholastic stars whg ex-
pect to enter this fall.

The following men will have the

 

honor of wearing the track insignia:
Cap’t. Marshall, Mc_Kinney,_ Galrvin,
‘Scott, Boots,‘ Panyity, Hise, ‘Mc-

Donald, Thomas, Ziegler, Rosenthal,

FENCING CLASS DISBAND-S
FOR THE SEASON

The Freshman fencing class has dis-
wbanded for the ‘present year to make a
strong bid for the varsity team next sea-
son. Under the able coaching of Prof.
'Postgate a class, of clever fencers has
been developed which with this year’s

varsity team -insures aiwinning aggrega- &

tion to represent Pitt in the _future. Too
much’ credit can not be given Prof.
Postgate for his interest in the team and
his efforts deserve’ the support of every

loyal Pitt man. . .

“But_ch” _Ochsenhirt, ’I5, has been
chosen to pilot next season’s basket ball

team at Pitt, while C. K. Murray ’I4 will‘

be the manager. _ With every man but
Frishman of this year’s championship
team back ‘next year. and a wealth‘-of
new and promising material to glraw
from, the prospects for the most suc-
cessful team in the history of basket
ball at Pitt are extremely bright.

A new league has been formed, known
as the Intercollegiate Basket Ball League
of Pennsylvania, consisting of the ‘East-
ern, Centralo-and_ Western Divisions.
The Eastern division will contain Lehigh,
Swarthm-ore and Franklin and Marshall.
The Central division will be composed
of Bucknell, Gettysburg, Susquehanna
and Albright. V State College, Washing-
ton and Jefferson and University of
Pittsburgh will compose the Western
division. . ‘, .i ‘

The winners of’ each division will
play a series for the «championship of the
state. A tentative ‘schedule has already
been arranged, but is not yet ready for
publication. . A '

This league will undoubtedly stir up
more interest than ever in basket ball‘,
not only throughout the state but in our
own localityg, .

t 1913 BASE BALL‘ REVIEW

 

Pitt closed’ the most successful
season‘ in the history of the Uni-
versity last Saturday with the‘ de-
feat of her old rival, W. Va.
University, ‘6 to in a thirteen in-
ning game. The team can easily claim
the championship of Western Penn-
sylvania. The nearest contender
would be W. & ]., since the "series
ended in a tie, each team "taking one
game, but the defeating of Bethany
and W. Va. Wesleyan, by decisive
scores by Pi t, puts aside all of the
Red & lac s claims to the cham-
pionship, since they each defeated W._
J,._ Westminster and Allegheny
were also defeated. Although Tech
was not played, she was beaten by
W. Va. Wesleyan" ‘on her’ home
grounds, so can lay no claifn to title.

. " (Continued from Page 10) A

Penn State won a closely contested
game by-at seore of five’ to four, at
State College. The game would have
been,Pitts but for a lucky drive along
the ﬁrst base foul line‘ in the seventh,
with two on. Michigan also won
against the Pitt nine, in a game that
never lagged. ' _ ' ‘ ‘

Of» the twenty—one ’ games played,
Pitt came‘ out with eleven to ,,its
credit. » Coach ,Ed,mundson deserves
great credit for«‘the° team that was
put out in as much as he was hindered
by the eligibility rules «being strictly
enforced. Ha‘d_H,arenski, the star
pitcher not been kept off the team
onaccount of lovvxstudies, the team
would have probably won atleast 90
