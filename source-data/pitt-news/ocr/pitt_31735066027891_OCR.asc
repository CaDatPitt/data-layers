Summer shooting incident:

Community_ gives
money to vlchm

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

Kevin Cecil probably used to think one of his
biggest expenses was scrounging up beer money for
domestic night.

Or maybe buying his next 400-page textbook for
an engineering class. '

Now he has to worry about getting an elevator
built into his house, so he can get to different floors
in his electronic wheelchair.

Now he and his family have to worry about med-
ical bills that have reached gigantic proportions in
less then two months.

Cecil, 21, was shot in the back last July, paralyz-
ing him for life, and his road to recovery is slowly
underway. Eventually, Kevin would like to return to
Pitt and get his degree from the School of

Kevin’s roommate Mike Sofranco. “He’s trying as
hard as he can.” '

Financially, Pitt has just jumped into the effort.
Yesterday, the school announced it will be setting up
an educational assistance fund for Cecil. $25,000
has already been raised for the fund, according to a
Pitt press release.

“It will be used for whatever equipment is neces-
sary that will__prov,i_cle,him_ with [the means] to com-
plete his studies,’’ "said. Ken "Service, Pitt spokesman.

' There is no timetable set for when or if Cecil will
return to Pitt.

Donations of $1,000 have been received from
local businessman David Ketchum and the Central
Pennsylvania Pitt Club, a branch of Pitt’s Alumni
Association located near Cecil’s hometown of
Boiling Springs.

Pitt officials said Ketchum and the Pitt Club were
key factors behind the origin of the fund-raising
effort.

“The catalyst was Mr. Ketchum, who originally
wrote Lawrence Weber [Pitt’s vice chancellor for
institutional advancement] about giving some
money to Kevin,” said Dennis Donham, a student
activities official.

“[The fund] was prompted by David Ketchum and
the Central Pennsylvania Pitt Club,” Service said.
“They approached the university and said they

t eater auditions

By J emiifer Alpha
For The Pitt News

You’re waiting" in the quiet lobby
just outside the social room of the
Steven Foster Memorial Theatre.
The silence itself is creating a thick,
nervous tension hi the air.

As you wait for your name to be
called, you can feel the adrenaline
taking over your body. Then the set
of wooden doors open and you know
you’re next.

This was the scene last night as
students waited to perform at Pitt
Theatre’s open auditions for this sea-
son’s productions.

Seven directors watched and lis-
tened for four hours as each student
performed a two-minute monologue.
The directors sat attentively, search-
ing for the actors who would ﬁt the

roles in the two mainstage, one
workshop and ﬁve lab productions
that will be staged this season.

Experience at the audition ranged
from senior theater ans majors with
many productions behind them to
non-theater arts majors out for the
ﬁrst time.

Regardless of the level of experi-
ence, the general consensus is that
auditioning results in a case of the
nerves.

Bob Kupperman, a senior theater
major who has appeared in “The
Ghetto,” “Cardenio” and ‘‘‘Tis a Pity
She’s a Whore,” all Pitt productions,
said that auditioning never gets easi-
er.

He said monologues and auditions
are stressful because you only get a
short time to show them what you’ve
got.

Voice-activated computers help disabled students

By Kim McGuire
For The Pitt News

Rock climbing over the
years caused tendonitis in
Timothy Rosenkoetter’s arms
so severe that he had trouble
picking up a cup of coffee.

Although his condition
is slowly improving,
Rosenkoetter’s arms still
cramp up when he types, mak-
ing word processing for
the second-year philosophy
graduate student nearly impos-
sible. .

For Rosenkoetter and other
students with disabilities. dic-
tating their work to others or
paying them to type their
papers is workable, but expen-
sive and time—consuming.

Today, adaptive technology
allows him to use a voice-acti-
vated computer which materi-
alizes his verbal commands on
the screen. Over the last year,
he and other students have
been training in one of the
region’s most advanced uni-
versity-based training labs for
students with physical, visual
and learning disabilities.

The Adaptive Computing
Training Lab, located on the
fifth ﬂoor of the William Pitt
Union, specializes in comput-
ing services for students with
disabilities.

It is designed to teach stu-
dents how to use the adaptive
equipment and programs so
they can use these and similar
computers located in Pitt’s

regular computing labs.

The lab opened last year in
collaboration with the
Learning Skills Center and the
Academic Computing division
of Computing and Information
Services. .

Since 1974. LSC has provid-
ed free support services to stu-
dents who wish to improve
their reading, math and study
skills. The Adaptive Computer
Training Lab is a natural out-
growth of these services as
more students with disabilities
enter Pitt.

“It is important that Pitt has
a facility like this.” said
Rosenkoetter. “because it can
make life for a student very
difficult if they have disabili-
ties.”

The director ' of LSC,
Georgine Materniak, said indi-
vidual assistance is very
important for students like
Rosenkoetter. “We learned in
the first year that we needed to
be able to respond to the stu-
dents’ individual needs. The
nature of the disability and
their course materials and
assignments are taken into
account for each student.”

For example, Shirley
Abriola, an entering social
work graduate student, has
limited use of her hands due to
cerebral palsy. Besides a nat-
ural period of adjustment, she
said the lab has been a won-
derful experience for her.

“This adaptive lab has

With a Passport,

_' you can go p/aces

By Karen Hillgrove
For The Pitt News

Have you been meaning to get out and see Pittsburgh’s cultur-
al sights?

Maybe you just realized that your art history course requires a
few visits to exhibits, or you may just want to see what this city
has to offer.

The Passport, a one-priced ticket to several places around the
city, is now available at the Downtown Visitors Information
Center on Liberty Avenue. The Passport costs $10 for one per-
_son or $35 for four people.

The price includes three vouchers for separate admissions to
places such as The Andy Warhol Museum, the Camegie muse-
ums, The Carnegie Science Center, Photo Antiquities and the
Pepsi Plaza Ethnic Festivals at Station Square.

It also includes two vouchers for PAT buses, the T or the
inclines. The Passport is available to anyone of any age and will
be available at Pittsburgh area Thrift Drugs beginning in
October. —

Mayor Murphy started the Passport program last November.
It is designed to make Pittsburgh easily accessible to visitors.
The program is also used by locals to save a few dollars while

 

 ht uring the city.

j The Passport is issued twice a year in the fall/winter edition
_ , , j d the spring/summer edition, which includes different attrac-
' .  ’- ons such as Kennywood Park. The spring/summer edition will
’ if available in April.

 A complete list of where the Passport is honored is available

at the Downtown Visitors’ Information Center.

'. , ., Anttotal of $8.3 million was awarded to a project at Pitt that
_ irvill set new performance standards for school children in
 he subject areas of math, English, science and applied
earning. '
_  “New Standards is a comprehensive approach to one of the
I = "1 greatest challenges facing America — setting clear expecta-
tions for student performance and a fair method of measur-
'ing that performance,” said Robert B. Schwartz, program
director for education at the Pew Charitable Trusts.
.. Pew Charitable Trusts granted the money to Pitt’s
* Learning Research and Development Center to fund the
" development of a nationwide performance-based assessment
system for school children.
_ Rather than testing students, like many standardized acad-
emic assessment programs do, the New Standards Project
will examine a portfolio of individual students’ essays, lab
Investigations and class projects in order to _compare that
tudent to national standards.
“The performance standards and assessments that New
i Standards is .developing will provide a practical foundation
_. for high academic achievement in American Schools,” said
' Lauren Resnick, director of LRDC and co-director of NSP.
__ . The money was received from Pew Charitable Trusts and
-«  the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and will
. finance the project for the next three years. The project has
 been in existence for the past four years, and the money
._ if received to date from Pew Charitable Trusts is $13.1 mil-
' lion.
‘ The University of California has a similar group also
working on the NSP. The grant finances the group at Pitt and
the group inCa1ifornia.
, Resnick said the donation would finance the group’s com-
munication and travel expenses, materials and printing costs.
There are 10 people working full-time on the project at the
LRDC and the same number of people working in the
University of California office. Research is also being done

t Center on Education and the Economy. .

“There [is] huge enthusiasm for getting to the final tests
that people will be able to use,” Resnick said.
i “We are deeply grateful for these grants,” said Mark S.
Tucker, NCEE president and co-director of NSP. “They are a
major vote of confidence in our work to date.”

The New Standards Project will be in use across the nation
by this spring or next fall.

opened a lot of doors for
me.” she said. “I’m a social
work major, and the voice-
activated computer allows
me to do jobs more effi-
ciently. I’m doing it more
for myself.”

Students like Abriola and
Rosenkoetter, who have
limited use of their hands,
find working with standard
computer keyboards diffi-
cult. To compensate, the
Kurzweil VOICE Terminal
performs word processing
for them without a key-
board.

Instead of typing on a
keyboard, students wear
headsets and dictate their
papers verbally into the
computer. The computer
then displays the output on
the screen.

Abriola said it took her
two semesters before she
felt comfortable with the
new computer. “I’m a per-
son who wants to learn

. something right away. You

have to learn that it takes
time for the computer to
learn your voice.”

Rosenkoetter said the
obstacles he encounters
would have been insur-
mountable without the
voice—activated computer.

“It would be verging on
the impossible to finish this
semester with all the writ-
ing I have to do. I have over
70 pages of writing every
term.”

The lab also features a
text scanner, which scans a
textbook or other docu-
ments into text that can be
vocalized. Students can
then store the data on a
ﬂoppy disc cassette tape to
use outside the lab.
Enlarged computer screens
and calculator screens help
students with low vision to
see text and mathematical

graphs. A Braille translation

keyboard allows students to

read what is on the screen.

The Adaptive Computing
Training Lab plans to add
more programs to Pitt’s
main campus server this
fall, making many of these
services available to all the
computer labs on campus.

Training on these com-
puters provides students
with the skills they need
when they enter into the
work force. Steve Tokar,
academic and adaptive
computer specialist, said
students who take advan-
tage of the lab benefit great-
ly.
“They are more employ-
able when they graduate.
They are more indepen-
dent,” he said.

Wilma Palombo, instruc-
tional technology specialist,
stressed the importance of
student independence.

“Our goal is to enable stu-
dents to be as independent
and self-advocating as pos-
sible,” she said.

would like to get it started.”

“People can identify with someone
who has suffered a setback,” Donham
said about the concern from the Pitt

' community.

In addition to the fund at Pitt, two
other donation funds have been set up.
One was designed by neighbors and
friends of Cecil. It will also go toward
equipment and other medical needs of
Cecil.

The Pitt News has also set up a fund
for the Cecil family for outside expens-
es -not covered by insurance costs.

Cecil was walking a woman home
from a bar in South Oakland July 13
when he was shot in the back by three
individuals. The couple was outside
Webster Hall on Dithridge Street and
Fifth Avenue when they were
approached from behind. Last month
Pittsburgh City Police arrested three
suspects who were later charged with
attempted murder.

Two of the suspects are juveniles. A
second hearing is set for Sept. 18,
when a judge will decide if the
Allegheny County District Attorney’s
office can try the juveniles as adults.

°Fr0m page 1

“In two minutes you have to
present a developed character,”
Kupperman said. What helps is
being prepared.

“Have your lines down so that
you can say them in your sleep,”
he said. “Sometimes if you’re
lucky you won’t get nervous.”

Rachel Sackheim, a sopho-
more theater arts major, was one
of those out on her ﬁrst audition.

“I was nervous, but I like the
adrenaline rush,” she said.

To prepare for her two minutes
before the panel, she made sure
she knew her lines, but she also
said that you can worry too
much about being prepared.

Sackheim waited in the lobby
10 minutes before she was
called. Ten minutes gives your
mind at least ﬁve chances to run
over the lines of a two—minute
monologue. That also gives your
nerves a chance to get the best of
you.

Sackheim learned, for the next
time, to just tell herself, “If‘you
know it, you can do it.” C

Rachel Wynn, a senior the!“ 9’
arts major, said she rememl
her first audition — for the
1992 season.

“I was petriﬁed,” she saic ,,
didn’t know anyone, but now: it s
easier because everyone in there.
Iknow.”  

Still, she gets nervous at a’ di-.
tions. 
“I just want to get in there Find
get out,” she said. i ,_.

,«.

The directors know what

actors are feeling and understand

the pressure.

Heather Harrison, a thea
arts major who will be direct
“Dentity Crisis,” one of the
productions, described auditir
ing as a “painful process.”

She said she understands t
jitters of the minutes before yr
name is called, but that for h
the adrenaline rush was alwa
the best part.

When casting actors for h
shows, she looks for “energ
enthusiasm and a willingness
work.”

Personality and presence is
important as experience, s
said. If a person is right for t
part, she can work with them
their acting skills.

Tim -Golebiewski, workit
toward his M.A., is directi:
“Phaedra” this season as his tl
sis piece. He said he likes to c.-
actors with a mixture of expe
ence in his productions.

“The only way to get expe
ence is to start with somethi‘
small,” he said

Kupperman agreed even t

9 small parts count

“Getting cast in anything
ftm,” he said.

Anthony Greco, a sophomc
economics major, is happy
have gotten the experience
coming out to his ﬁrst audition.

“It’s something new for mt
he said, “something I’ve alwa
wanted to do. Whether I get c..
or not, it’s something I alwa;
wanted to do.”

For those who have caught th
eye of a director, there is mor

A GOOD WOMAN IS HARD To FIND

The Brothers McMuIIen
Written" and Directed by
Edward Burns

The Brothers McMu/len is
Edward Burns’ directorial
debut, and as such can cer-
tainly be considered a suc-
cess. Burns has crafted what I
can only assume is a personal
film about the relationship
problems of three Irish broth-
ers living on Long Island.

We meet brother Barry,
played by Burns himself, in
the first scene of the film,
which takes place right after
his father’s funeral. Barry’s
mother tells him that she is
going back to Ireland to be
with the man who she has
been in love with for the past
30 years. It seems her hus-
band was a no-good alcoholic
and an abusive scoundrel,
and the whole family is happy
enough that he is dead.

Five years later, circum-
stance has it that Barry, age
25, and his 22-year old broth-
er Patrick (Mike McGlone) find
themselves temporarily with-
out shelter. Here comes big
brother Jack (Jack Mulcahy),
a 33-year-old married man, to
the rescue. All it takes is a few
bottles of Guinness to con-
vince him to let his younger
brothers stay with him and his
wife in the house they all grew
up in “for a little while.”

Well, this is long enough for
each of the boys to have a
relationship-type crisis with a
member of the opposite sex.
Barry, an aspiring screenwriter
who sees himself as the ulti-
mate bachelor, meets a young
actress while apartment-hunt-
ing in the Village and begins
to fear that he might be falling
in love. Ho hum.

Slightly more interesting is
Jack’s sudden and unexpect-
ed affair with another woman,
shortly after his declaration
that he would never, ever do
such a thing. His guilt is

_ rivaled only by P_at'rick»’s, who

believes he is going to Hell
after his girlfriend (who he was
about to break up with any-
way) breaks up with him
because she is pregnant and
plans to have an abortion. Of
course Patrick, a devout
Catholic, has his own opinions
about that.

Burns’ no-frills camera style

is what won me over, because
I’m not really much into cute,
uplifting relationship films. This
is really the type of movie that
my mom might like, but it
might not have an elaborate
enough budget or handsome
enough leading men for her
tastes, I’m not sure.

The music in this film is

great, and well-used. The con-
trast of traditional Irish instru-
mental music with contempo-
rary street scenes of New
York City is really wonderful.

I haven’t seen any of the
huge twentysomething roman-
tic comedy-type films starring
Ethan Hawke or whoever, and
l’ve got a pretty good hunch

that I never will, but I can say,

with fair certainty that The
Brothers McMuIlen kicks their
collective pansy ass. If this is
your cup of tea, then definitely
check it out.

SI.-IIIIIEI. w|'rHou'I' A (must:  

Desperado

Written, edited and directed
by

Robert Rodriguez

Starring Antonio Banderas,
Salma Hayek and Joaquim de
Almedia

Isn’t it just like Hollywood to

V give an overrated actor with

devilish good looks a gun (or
a pair of fangs) not only to
make women swoon, but also
to please the gun-and-run
wannabe rambos? I bet pro-
ducers believe that with
Desperado they have the best
of both worlds — the ultimate
date movie.‘ One which
makes the middle-aged
women feel that they are
walking out on the arm of one
handsome bandito, and the
men, well, their six-shooters
are cooked and ready to fire.

Not just anyone handles a
gun well, and explaining to
someone how to be graceful
and a hardass with a gun is a
feat in itself. Unfortunately, in
this respect, the second time
around with a much bigger
budget, Robert Rodriguez
sells himself short. It could
have been the blow-up-doll
actors. Or maybe there was
no need for a continuation of
the low budget ($7000) El
Mariachi in the first place.

Fo_r those of you familiar
with Rodriguez’s 1992 El
Mariachi, you know how
beautiful simplicity can be.
Critics raved about his quick

camera shots, many claiming
them to be genius. Rodriguez
himself, in classic B-style
humor, shook the_compli-
ments off explaining that his
shots were so quick because
he just didn't have enough
film.

But now, give the boy a big
budget and look what he
does. He took the unfamiliar,
hard-nosed Mexican actors
and replaced them with the
glamorous, Hollywood type
with whiskers (Cheech Marin
excluded.) The mariachi that
roamed around in the 1992
version was at first only a
mariachi, a musician who was
forced to pick up a gun. Now,
Antonio Banderas stars as
the mariachi who just can't
quite get enough revenge,
and his persistence gets run
into the ground.

Rodriguez claimed that film-
makers John Woo and Sam
Raimi have greatly inspired
him. Present through
Desperado are choppy
instances of his admired
directors. He also explains
that timing, in a great action
sequence, is everything. Even
with an astronomical budget,
Rodriguez could not even
come close to capture the
precise, maniacal action that
John Woo delivers to audi-
ences. We catch glimpses of
Banderas shooting up the
slime which accumulates in
the seedy bars, usually dou-
ble-fisted (uh, who taught this
boy to fight, Chow Yun Fat)?
The most obvious copied
Woo-style is a showdown
within Cheech’s (yes, sidekick
of Chong) bar. Banderas
faces off with one of the last

 
 

    

amigos standing (and no, it’s
not Quentin Tarantino). The
two rummage around the
corpse-ridden floor searching
for one loaded gun, each time
pointing the barrel of yet
another dead thug’s gun at
one another, only to hear
clicks. This scene almost
worked, but Rodriguez did not j
successfully captured that
Woo ability of presenting silli-
ness with such a hard edge.
‘I tried to figure out why
Rodriguez chose to make/re-
make what was already a
good movie. Maybe at the
time he felt that he could have
done so much more. ‘‘If onlyl
had a few more million, I'd
make a great film, hmm..."
Guess again. ‘

T.V. Nation
Fox
Friday 8 p.m.

News shows have become
the next big thing in the tele-

vision industry. Hard-hitting

journalism, making those
poor bastards sweat under

the ticking clock of 60‘

Minutes, has been installed
as the conscience of the
viewing audience. But really,
don't these people take them-
selves a little too seriously? it
seems to have become a
mental masturbationary exer-
cise for the troubles of the
world; racism, hate and death
are compounded with angry
white men yelling at each
other. It's good to see that in
some cases, instead of
screaming back, there's a lit-
tle laughter.

T. V. Nation is a news show,
and it isn’t. Like the other
news shows, it confronts evil
corporations, hate-groups,
devious politicians (all of what
is wrong in the world, really)
and smiles back at them,
showing just how ridiculous
these views and actions are.
Michael Moore, creator, host
and madman, sends his crew
throughout the country to put
a twist on the issues that are
everywhere and, most impor-
tantly, he does it well.

Moore began his
vengeance on all that's bad
with the movie Fioger and
Me, an exposé on the
General Motors corporation
and their exit from Flint,
Mich., which caused that
city’s subsequent collapse. It
was sad and informative, but
more-over it was able to get
its point across with humor
and irony. It was what we all
seemed to know already —-
that there is the gap, both
economic and mental,
between the working-class
stiff and the white-collar man'-
agement that tells them what
to do. Yet Roger and Me (the
Roger being Roger Smith,
GM president) also showed
many for the first time the
fear that the upper class feels
and its need to isolate itself
from anything which might
blemish its perfect picture.

T. V. Nation does the same
thing, and more. Crackers the
Crime-Fighting Chicken bat-
tles the evils of corporate
crime, and although the
chicken himself never gets to
direct his views to the people
responsible for. making deci-
sions, he does get a
response (usually the push-
ing-out-of-front-doors, hand-
over-cameras, “no comment”
sort of reaction).

A recent episode, “Love
Week,” focused on the hate-

 

  5 . September? 1995

  

group phenomenon and ‘chal-
lenged its views not with rea-
son and understanding (it
seems too far-fetched to
hope for reason), but with a
group of singers Iuvvin’ it up
outside of a militia compound
and a gay men's choir out-
side of Jesse Helms’ office
and house (the Mrs. Helms
cameo was a classic). In
another spot, Yaphet Kotto,
actor, black man and African
prince, was shown to be

unable to hail a cab in New

York City as many times as a
man dressed in a bear suit.
Moore and the other
reporters of T.l/. Nation show
just how ridiculous so many
things are that we take for
granted —— decisions of politi-
cians and big business and
the opinions of many at
whom we laugh. There is a
distinct slant behind his
views, but it’s obvious and

never hidden. Yet because ”

he entertains as well as
enlightens (key phrase for the
‘90s), it never becomes
preachy. In fact, it’s almost
the anti-preach, a “shut-up” to
the world, one might say.
Cancelled by NBC after
only half a season, the show
found new life at FOX.
Although it gets rave reviews
throughout the press, it is fail-
ing again in the ratings and is

Fugazi
Red Medicine
Dischord

Almost any fan of punk rock
or hardcore would have to
admit that Fugazi is an impor-
tant band. Fronted by Ian
MacKaye, a member of semi-
nal punk band Minor Threat,
Fugazi has been making music
that is -powerful, innovative and
melodic — music that just plain
rocks — for years. The chal-
lenge for Fugazi is to keep
moving, keep current and keep
innovating.

Too many bands in today’s

musical world are selling

records by facelifting ‘70s
songs or churning out album
after album of the same stuff.
Fugazi's Red Medicine proves
that these D.C. kids (OK, so
they're starting to go bald) can
still innovate and keep their
integrity.

Red Medicine starts off with
some noise, in this case what
sounds like a garage band
j mming through a blown bass

    

amp turned to 11. Trendy “lo-fi”
crap? I think not. While Fugazi
experiments - with noise
throughout the album, it never
continues so long as to
become annoying. It just
demonstrates their ability to
make use of another musical
arrow in their quiver. “Do You
Like Me” is classic angry
Fugazi, complete with the
trademark “crew vocal” chorus-
es and political references. It's
very reminiscent of 1994's In
on the Kill Taker album, which
pulsed with anger. Songs like
“Bed for the Scraping” and
“Back to Base” pair a classic
example of MacKaye’s lyrics
with an equally classic Fugazi
riff, both hard and hummable,
then updates it with new guitar
tones and a dose of disso-
nance. lt’s inviting, sing-
alongish, enough to make me
climb walls.

Lyrically, the boys from D.C.
are right on top of it as well.
“Target” rips up your favorite
target and mine: major labels
and the bands they sign. For
them, becoming one of “a

thousand grudging young mil-
lionaires” is not worth “oi|ing
like crime.” “By You” takes
shots at the marketing of
everything, even the concept
of generations, to the world.
And best of all, they have cred-
ibility. Unlike Rage Against the
Machine, ex-straightedgers-
gone-MTV, MacKaye and
Fugazi still turn out hits on
cheap ($8 for this CD), inde-
pendent, Dischord records. No
marketing here, kids.

So Fugazi can still turn out
the kind of music I expect, with
a few new twists, you say. So
what? OK, then pay attention:
Fugazi is also reinventing itself
on Red Medicine. “Forensic

Scene” features clever rhymes.

and meters, tripping over bar
lines and creating a very mel-
low, unique flow. Add to that
the fact that legitimate,
reserved singing occurs, and
you have groundbreaking
material. lnstrumentally,
the innovation hinted at on
“Forensic Scene,” with its fla-
menco-influenced bass and
round, in-the-pocket guitar
work, continues. Slow- and
mid-tempo songs abound.
Trademark stuttering guitars
are replaced by a more sus-
tained, flowing sound. Drum
work, always clean on any
Fugazi album, features novel
off-beat fills. “Version” is an
experimental electronic piece.
Fugazi is clearly stretching
barriers and refusing to be

Ever since mid-to-late 1993
when The Notorious B.l.G.
started stirring his name in the
record industry pot, one name
kept popping up: Junior
M.A.F.l.A. When he went plat-
inum-plus with his album and
all his singles, the crew name
became more infamous.
Industry heads and patrons
alike became antsy to see
what these kids would sound
like. One question rang con-
stantly in my head: if these
kids possess the buttah flava,

 
   

w h y
didn’t Biggie let them represent
on his album? After checking
this album, now I know why.
When “PIayer’s Anthem”
was introduced to the public in
spurts, everyone went ballistic
because they thought it was an
unreleased Biggie joint. The
track was simplistic but effec-
tive. The hook was catchy &
everyone loved it. Biggie put
his thing in action like always;
Little Kim showed a little skill;
but no one had ever heard

Little Cease’s part (at the dis-_

cretion of the deejays). The
song is indeed a party classic.
Nothing much can be said for
the rest of the album  at all.
There are no phat tracks, no
rhyme skills worth mentioning;
it’s a total waste of money (on
the part of the investors and
the customers). These kids got
put on because of who they
know; definitely not on skill fac-
tor. Not even Biggie’s other
cameos (“Oh My Lord” & “Get
Money”) could save this
album. Proof is in the next sin-

You know this kid; the origi-
nal Don Dada. Check “Ghetto
Red Hot,” an underground and
party classic. Check “Dem No
Worry Me.”

Check “DoIIy My Baby,”
another underground, party
and crossover classic. Check
“Scalp Dem,” an underground
hit done with Method Man.
Now, the year is 1995, and the

kid who's “Big & Ready” is’

back in the game.

When “Girls Town” hit, it
was a disappointment, until I
heard the Erick Sermon remix.
If your biggest hits come from
the hip hop beats, why change
the flavor?

The choice joints to check

for are “Warning,” a gritty

r r

underground hip hop track with
don dada rippin’ things in half;
“Too Greedy,” a buttah classic
dancehall break with lyrics
dissin’ greedy women; and
“Forgive Me Jah,” a hip hop
dancehall mix to season the
pot.

The album is like a starter
album. His flow is on time, but
most of the music didn’t work.
In my estimation, it seems like
he didn’t pay any attention to
what was working for him. For
the most part, we can look for-
ward to the remixes that make
us bounce, but don’t be tricked
into this album.

Since no good singles have
come this week, there will be
no Starting 5 Singles this

Fugazi truly is growing -

final track on the album, “Long

and yet the band manages to
keep its distinctive, quirky pop
style moving along pretty much
the same track. Also intact is
Luna’s ability to write a very
inconsistent album, ranging
from catchy and bouncy pop to
mellow psychedelica to down-
right boring.

, Now, hey, don’t get me

wrong. all really like Luna: ~|--am

a big fan of frontman Dean
Wareham and have been so
since the Galaxie 500 days of
yore. Honest. I even have an
original promotional poster
from On Fire that I stole from a
radio station in Bloomington,
|nd., back when l was just a lit-
tle cheeba-smokin’ vinyl mon-
key talking to no one on cable
FM radio. Back when Rough
Trade records let Kramer of
Bongwater infamy (and
Shimmy Disc Records glory)
press the thickest dang vinyl
ever, and Dean, Damon and
Naiomi ruled the pre-grunge
New York folk art Neil
Young/Velvet Underground
scene as Galaxie 500. Now
that band broke some ground
and offered a viable, consider-
ably mellower alternative to the
confusion and angst of Sonic
Youth. Galaxie 500 broke up,
leading to a Damon and
Naiomi album that was pretty
weak, and now those same
two ex-Galaxieites’ participa-

5 345/441

  

iTired of
r i din g t h e
roller coaster

tion in the underground band,
Magic Hour. That leaves us
with Dean Wareham, former
Galaxie front guy gone rogue.
Confused yet? Good. Cause
here is where we get back to
Luna.

Dean left Galaxie 500 in an
effort to achieve a cleaner,
tighter pop sound that would

-» be more accessible to the gen-
eral public perhaps and defi-~ --

nite_|y to Dean’s Velvet
Underground-inspired roots.
So Luna was born, and they
hobnobbed with New York
City's gallery crowd and were
deemed good. Their first
album, Lunapark, was a nice
little collection of pop songs
that got old pretty quickly. But
the band showed promise, and
songs like “Hey Sister” demon-
strated that they had obviously
smoked a lot of dope and lis-
tened to Spacemen 3 and
early Bowie a lot. Dean also let
his offbeat, deadpan humor
shine with lines like “You can
never give the finger to the
blind/ sometimes I act so stu-
pid but you never seem to
mind/ that’s no way to be,
laughing at the deaf/ i know
that I repeat myself when l’ve
got nothing left.” Lines like that
are novel but don’t make an
album.

Luna’s real debut to a larger
market came with the release

of the Slide EP. It included the
song “Slide” from Lunapark
and an alternate version of
“Hey Sister.” Also on the EP
were a pair of covers, including
an absolutely inspired version
of Lou Reed and John Cale’s
“Ride Into the Sun.” Luna hit
upon something there that
turned out to be perhaps their
greatest asset: they were real-
ly. .go.o,d at doing Velvet
Underground stuff. B'u"t’not in a
cheesy way. In a good, sincere
and inspired way. '

Luna geared up for its sec-
ond album, Bewitched, and
caught the attention of none
other than former Velvet
Underground guitarist Sterling
Morrison. Bewitched came out
and really established Luna as
heirs to the VU throne, espe-
cially in New York and over-
seas..Heck, it even landed
them a contract with Calvin
Klein, who used two Luna
tracks as background music
for an “Obsession” commercial
or something really slutty and
perverted. That Luna were
media sluts was never really a
question, they were the grand-
children of Warhol and lived in
a land where EVERYTHING
was for sale. Sterling helped
out with some fabulous tracks,
the best of which was “Tiger
Lilly,” which reveled in its
Velvet Underground clean and

September 7 1995 9 _

spastic sound. And songs like
“Sleeping Pill” and “lnto the
Fold” delved into a territory of
mellowness where only
Spacemen 3/Spiritualized and
Mazzy Star dare to tread and
tread well. Bewitched was a
success commercially and
artistically and a coup for
Dean, who had never gotten
his proper rewards for the bril-
liance of Galaxie 500.

And so the. third album,
Penthouse hit the shelves and
l for one was dying to hear it.
And it was good, but like
Lunapark, itlacks the convic-
tion of Slide and Bewitched.
Stanley Demeski lays down
some real nice, minimal
drums. Dean and Sean Eden
pull off some very nice, clean
guitar work that ranges from
jangly pop to psychedelic
drone, watery wah work, loop-
ing backwards guitar riffs and
some well-controlled feedback .

here and there. But there are ‘*\

only two or three tracks that
stand out. Those tracks, how-
ever, are as good as anything
Luna has ever done and are
well worth the price of the
album, even if everything in
the middle is merely compe-
tent and nice. In essence:
Stick a cello in it, turn it over
and it's done. Luna is far from

a Seattle band, but the
analogy applies.

“Hedgehog” is one song
that I can't figure out. Luna
goes punk? I don’t know
but it definitely does noth-
ing for me. There are a lot
of other songs that are bet-
ter than what you here on
most radio stations but still
not up to Luna's potential.
What is up to Luna's
potential, sparked perhaps
by some great guitar from
‘70s rock icon Television's
Tom Verlaine, is the song
“23 Minutes in Brussels.”
From Justin Harwood’s
hypnotic bass to the
catchy-yet-eerie guitars to
Dean's catchy chorus
(“Say a prayer for you and
me/ say a prayer, tell me
do you miss me?”) “23
Minutes in Brussels” is
chock full 0’ jammin’ good-
ness, Velvety pop fun and
some big, sharp ol’ hooks.
If the rest of the album was
half as good as this song, it
would be at least twice as
good as it is now. And sim-
ple math tells you that this
is just a quirky, inconsis-
tent album. But Luna is a
quirky, inconsistent band. It
is part of their charm, I
suppose.

I guess I would have to
say that Penthouse was
worth the money I spent to
buy it. If you are a Luna
fan, it is certainly worth
getting. But if you are new
to Luna, I would probably
tell you to buy Bewitched
before you got this album.
You would probably enjoy
both better. And I would

recommend that anyone

buy any Galaxie 500
albums you can get your
hands on if you like mellow
psychedelica. Good luck,
though, since Ga|axie’s
label, Rough Trade, is out
of business and thus their
catalog is largely out of
print. Perhaps if Luna puts
out a really good record, -all
that old stuff will go back
intoprint. Heck, it hap-
pened to Sonic Youth, it
could happen to anyone.

Opinions

  What about education?

Today marks the third day of operation for the newly pri-
vatized Turner Elementary School in Wilkinsburg
Township. If you haven’t been following the debate over
the past few months, Turner made history on Tuesday by
becoming the first public school in the country to hire a pri-
vate company to manage the school. The privatization
occurred after two-and-a-half years of planning, and though
what is being called the Turner Initiative is not yet final, it
will undoubtedly lead to a serious look in labor, contract
and education laws. But it makes no difference whether the
laws are on the side of the teacher’s union or the school
board; the laws should be on the side of the children.

If the Turner experiment proves as successful as school

I . board members hope it will be, other schools in the

W_-ilkinsburg area are likely to follow this example. If it

 -passes the legal test when the issue goes before the state

Supreme Court on Sept. 18, schools around the country
_ might follow this path as well.

i The primary issue the Court will be asked to determine is
whether or not state laws (as they stand) allow for the
school board (as, in essence, an arm of the government) to
contract with groups like Alternative Public Schools Inc.
.(which now runs Turner). Another problem which arose
with the privatization of Turner Elementary is that some
members of the teachers’ union found themselves out of a
job, replaced with teachers hired by APSI.

The most serious question, however, which is being
neglected to a large extent, is this: what is best for the chil-
dren who go to the school? The teacher’s union is question-
ing the legality of the contract, but why is no one question-
ing the value of the education which Turner students are
receiving? People have ‘lost jobs, but what about the chil-
dren who were not getting the primary education they
would need to get a job ever? These are, by far, more seri-

 ous issues than any disagreement about statutory interpreta-

('8.

tion.

Much has been said about allowing public schools to be
privately run, but the bottom line is this: the public school
system is falling to a dismal level, and something absolutely
must be done to bring it back up. Though some private
schools are certainly no better than public ones, this is- a
legitimate alternative that needs to be explored.

Primary school is where children receive the foundation
upon which the entire rest of their education will be built.
As the saying goes, today’s children are tomorrow’s leaders.
Instead of focusing on whether the school is public or pri-
vate, we should center our concern on how much the chil-
dren are being taught. If the quality of the education chil-
dren are receiving at Turner improves, the Turner Initiative
has achieved its goal.

Mike e d n e
Sofranco s d ay,

July 12, was just a typical
summer day here in
Pittsburgh. My roommate,
Kevin Cecil, and I ended up at
Peter’s Pub with some other
friends that evening, as usual.
I felt tired and left around
midnight to get some sleep. At
6 a.m., I woke to an empty
apartment and an uneasy feel-
ing that all was not well.
Unable to fall asleep again, I
lay in bed trying in vain to
come up with a reason why
Kevin was not running around
getting ready for work. At 7
a.m., the phone rang. I was
afraid to answer it, but I
rushed to pick it up as the
voice of Kevin’s mom
emanated from the answering
machine

At 1:30 that morning, Kevin
was walking a friend home.
As they approached the
entrance to Webster Hall, one
block off campus in North
Oakland, two individuals ran
up behind them. Without a
word, without warning, these
people (the use of this word is
debatable) pulled a gun and
tried their best to execute
Kevin. A bullet hit Kevin in
the back of his neck and trav-
elled through the middle of his
spinal cord. Their objective
accomplished, the two indi-
viduals simply ran away as
Kevin fell flat on his face on
the cement sidewalk.

As you read this, Kevin is
now on his back in a rehab
center, paralyzed from the
neck down, struggling to
breathe on his own. I don’t
remember that first morning
very well, except for feeling a
curious mix of confusion,
helplessness and rage. The
next week went by in a blur. I
didn’t sleep more than a cou-

ple hours a night, and I was on
the go constantly.

I spent more hours in Presby
than anyone should ever care
to spend. At the end of that
week Kevin left for rehab
three-and-a-half hours away,
and I hit rock bottom both
physically and emotionally.
After everything that had hap-
pened, I still had 14 credits of
engineering waiting for me. A
few days later, I was as emo-
tionally high as I have ever
been as a manager for Phish
told me Trey had recorded a
song for Kevin and he needed
Kevin’s address. And then I
set the phone down and start-
ed thinking again 

I think about the last time I
saw him standing there, lean-
ing against the bar, another
face in the crowd. Kevin will
never again walk up the stairs
to our apartment. He will
never throw a frisbee or kick a
hacky sack. Kevin’s dog Zack
now needs to find someone
else to throw his ball to him.
An intramural soccer team
needs a new captain. A certain
racquet ball racquet will not
be smashed against the wall
because it doesn’t work_. A
certain smiling face will not
be seen here at Pitt for a while

If you ask Pitt’s administra-
tion about Kevin, it will reply
that this is a tragedy, and
everyone is taking it very per-
sonally. It will also tell you
that this is a safe campus, and
it is doing all it possibly can
to protect us. In my very limit-
ed dealings with the adminis-
tration, I tried to be diplomat-
ic. Now I will speak my mind.

The only reason I am a stu-
dent here is because three
years ago this school offered
me too much money even to
think about other schools. I
have never recommended Pitt

It could happen to you, too

to anyone, and I sure as hell
never will. I seek to dissuade
prospective students every
chance I get.

A safe urban campus is not
a safe campus, a minor techni-
cality not often acknowledged
by the administration. The
administration likes to quote
statistics about how we only
had “x” amount of theft, and
“y” instances of sexual
assault. What they don’t tell
you is that twice in the past
year Pitt students have been

beaten to the brink of death.‘

One “assault” occurred on a
university parking lot. The
other occurred on the steps
going up to the Towers. I per-
sonally know of three unre-
ported muggings this past
summer. A couple of years
ago, I saw a gun pulled and
pointed at someone in Zelda’s.
Everyone should realize that
it is not possible to walk safe-
ly around our neighborhood
after dark. The kind of thing
that happened to Kevin will
happen again. Anyone who is
naive enough to think that
such a crime can never be
directed toward them has it
coming. “The other guy” is a
person too. “The other guy”
could be your best friend or
your roommate. It could be
me. It could be you. Please do
what is necessary to be safe.
If you ever find yourself
walking down South Bouquet
Street toward the post office,
check the sidewalk across the
street from Joncaire Street.
There you will find, in a now-
extinct handwriting, the ini-

ttials KSC. As you look at_

those initials, you can wonder
with me about what could
have been, what should have
been, and what is

is Kevin Cecil 's roommate.

Soccer wins second in a row

By Eric Knopsnyder
For the Pitt News

The Pitt soccer team rolled to their sec-
ond straight win last night in a non-con-
ference game over visiting Slippery Rock.
The win upped their record to 2-1, all in
non-conference games, w-hile the Rockets
dropped to 1-2.

Sophomore backfielder Jason Piombino
took a pass from Knut Saeter and put it
past SRU goalkeeper Don Kauffman at
the 70:00 mark. It was the Panthers’ only
goal in a 1-0 win. Piombino’s only shot of
the night was not a blast, but it was a
crushing blow to the SRU team.

Pitt head coach Joe Luxbacher called it,
“A good combination goal on a give—and-
go. Jason caught their keeper going the
wrong way. It was a good goal, but we
should have made more of our chances up

  

 

 

front.”

Luxbacher was referring to the fact that
while the Panthers dominated the game,
recording 12 shots on goal, they came
away with only one score.

“We played real well defensively and in
the midfield,” Luxbacher said. “We had a
little trouble up front, creating the scoring
opportunities that we should have had.”

Some credit, however, must also be
given to the Slippery Rock - squad.
Goalkeeper Kauffman stopped a few good
scoring opportunities, and his team played
some strong defense in front of him.
Twice in the second half Pitt players had
the chance to. shoot on an empty net, only
to be-stopped by the SRU defense.

Neither team could get on the score-
board in the first half of play. Luxbacher
was doing all he could, as he substituted

Willard promotes assistant Jones

By Ian M. Dryburgh
For The Pitt News

The Pitt Panthers’ head bas-
ketball coach’ Ralph Willard
announced that Bobby Jones
has been promoted to associate
head coach last Wednesday.
This means he willbe second
only to Willard in running the
team.

Jones, 34, who was along-
side Willard at Western
Kentucky for two years, came
to Pitt as an assistant in the
spring of this year. Coach
Willard thinks Jones is one of
the top assistants in college
basketball.

“We feel very fortunate to
have him on our staff at the
University of Pittsburgh. We
hope this recognition serves as
a sign that Bobby is an excel-
lent candidate to run a
Division I basketball pro-
gram,” Willard said in a press
release.

Jones helped engineer Pitt’s
recruiting class this year. It is
being touted as one of the top
five in the country by many
recruiting services. Pitt’s 1995

freshman class earned him a
spot as-one of -top 10 college
basketball recruiters in the
East by Eastern Basketball. .
Jones commented, “We were
very fortunate to put together a
class that I think will turn the
program around. We’ve landed
five of the top 50 prospects in
the country. They’re not only

good athletes, they’re good
kids, a foundation for the
future.”

Originally from Macon, Ga.,
Jones attended college at
Western Kentucky, where he

was one of 29 players to reach
1,000 points in his career.

Before coaching at Western
Kentucky, Jones was an assis-
tant at Middle Tennessee for
one season in 1991.

When asked if he’d like to
become ‘a head coach some-
where, Jones replied, “I’d love
to become a head coach some-
day. But right-now I have a job
to do working with coach
Willard, learning from hands-
on experience. I’m very
patient. I’m in no hurry.”

Jones said this year the
Panthers will be able to play a
different style of basketball.

“This year we will play a
40—minutes-of—pressure, up-
tempo style game which we
were unable to do in the past,”
Jones said. “Now we have
more ﬂexibility and depth with
the young kids. We have some
very talented players who can
play two or three different
positions. Last year we were
lucky if we had seven healthy
bodies. Our success depends
upon how the new kids adjust
to the new style and level of

play.”

Dell Seagrclves is hu e
Panther tight end tips the sca es
in Pitt's Favor for Saturday
night's fight against Eastern

- .C0]umnist Both the Pitt Panthers and Eastern Michigan Eagles enter this
Matt week’s Tale of the Tape with identical 1-O records. Last week the

Panthers notched a 17-13 come-from-behind win against
Grove Washington State, while the Eagles beat Akron 49-29.

The 49 points were the most scored by an EMU team since 1971,
when the then-Hurons scored 50 in the season-opener against Oshkosh State.
Yes, Oshkosh State.

The Panthers lost starting tailback Billy West in their win on Saturday, and
EMU received equally bad news when senior free—safety Eric Thompson went
down with a broken leg.

Pitt enters the game a 20 1-2 point favorite over the Eagles. Twenty-and-one-
half points for a team that-has won nine games over the last three seasons. This
is definitely a great scheduling move. So before the spread gets any bigger, let’s
roll the tape.

Quarterback — John Ryan vs. Charlie Batch

Ryan threw for 226 yards on 28-47 passing and two scores. Wait a minute,

By Mike Kovak
Asst. Sports Editor

Sometimes things have to be pounded
into people’s heads before they realize
what is going on, especially when the sub-
ject of Pitt’s student “fans” comes into
question. -

This is the final reminder: Billy West is
out.

West will not play Saturday. West will
not play for a couple of Saturday games.
Who knows, West may not return this sea-
son at all.

All is not lost, yet. 9

As long as John Ryan and the Panther
receiving corps produce, Pitt possesses
two adequate fill-ins for the time being

- (hopefully).

The two backs likely to split West’s 25-
30 carries a game are senior Chris Patton

‘ and freshman Demetrius Harris. 4

4--“We have to fill in the gaps,” head
coach Johnny Majors said. “Of course,
Chris Patton and Demetrius Harris will
get the ball more.” . '

Patton, from Pittsburgh, has proved his
worth as a valuable and versatile role
player since he joined the Pitt squad in
1993 as a walk-on. He originally played
one season at Slippery Rock.

“He’s a gutty guy,” Majors said.

Luckily, Patton returned to playing run-
ning back during 1994 spring drills. He
had briefly moved to middle linebacker
during the 1993 season and at the begin-
ning of the 1994 spring drills.

Patton led all Panther rushers in last

spring’s Blue-Gold scrimmage, netting 64
yards on 10 carries, including a 25-yard
TD run.

Against Washington State, Patton car-
ried the ball nine times for 29 yards, with 
a long of nine yards.

The computer science major and Eagle
Scout graduated from Perry Traditional 
Academy. 2

Harris, from Brunswick, Ohio, appears 
to have a bright future at Pitt. He has been 
timed at 4.4 seconds in the 40-yard dash
and will now get the opportunity to utilize
his speed and agility. i

“I think he’s outstanding. He’s a major 
talent,” Majors said. 5

While playingfor Brunswick High 
School, Harris amassed more than 1,200
yards and tallied 17 touchdowns his senior
year. These numbers earned him the 
Northeast Ohio Player of the Year as well i

as a second-team All-State selection. 

Harris also participated in track, where he A
was named Brunswick’s Most Valuable 3.
Performer in that sport.

Majors finally saw what Harris could do
against the Cougars.

The 5-foot-10-inch, 180-pound runner
darted his way through the Cougar '
defense last Saturday for 32 yards on five
carries, with a long of 12 yards, the
longest run by any Panther back this sea-
son.

Panther fans, please do not fret, at least if
this Saturday. There is no better way to ‘
initiate two inexperienced running backs
than to throw them at the shaky talons of
the Eastern Michigan Eagles.

Pennsylvania officials

recently proposed a bill
. attempting to regulate pit
bulls. Because of the dogs’
. tendency to attack helpless
citizens, officials said that pit
bulls should be registered by
the state and owners should

 

pay a monthly fee.

If the bill is passed, then
the Big East Conference
might have to consider a way
to regulate “The Pitt Bul1s”
— the‘Panthers’ defense that
attacks anyone who moves.

“You know how a pit bull

‘attacks, when they grab you

and don’t let go, and just
being ferocious and vicious,

Zatiti Moody had one of three Panther sacks in last
Saturday’s game against the Cougars.

 

always attacking — that’s
what we try to do,” pack,
leader and linebacker Torn
Tumulty said. “We started
saying that last year, and we
kind of started living up to
it.” ‘

Although it’s only one
game, the defense definitely
did live up to its self-pro-
claimed nickname last
Saturday against Washington
State. The Bulls clamped
onto WSU from the first pos-
session and never relin-
quished their hold.

Pitt suffocated the
Cougars’ running attack,
holding them to only 14 rush-
ing yards in the ‘first half and
99 for the game. Washington
State’s air attack fared little
better — netting only 197
yards. g"

“Defensively, that was the
most important area of our
football team,” head coach
Johnny Majors said. “The
defense started off in a great
manner. That was the most
encouraging our defense has
been in three years. We are
quicker and faster getting to
the ball.” »

“I kept on saying we had
the ability to be a great
defense, and if we play
together well as 11 guys out
there, we’re going to be
good, and we did,” said
Tumulty, who led the game
with 17 tackles.

Tumulty and crew have a
less challenging task this

.with one’ patsy team, and

oddly enough, that team usu-
ally comes out of the Mid-
American Conference.

Enter Eastern Michigan —
another MAC team. Although
Pitt has never faced EMU,
the Panthers hold an 8-0 all-
time record versus MAC
teams. Put more bluntly, me‘
last three times Pitt faced, a
MAC opponent, the Panthers
have outscored them 116-29.

“They have some things
that can hurt us,” Tumulty
said. “We’re going to, try to

.,shut them out just like they
.' were Washington State. A
_team like this, you, let them

breathe a little, they’re going
to think they can play at this
level  They’re Division I-
A, right?” ”

Exactly. 

However, Eastern Michigan
is riding a five-game win
streak, dating back to last
season. EMU won its season-
opener-last week, 49-29,
against Akron. EMU’s 49
points were the most scored
since 1971.

Pitt has the task of stopping
the Eagles without its star
comerback, Denorse Mosley.
Mosley, whose total of six
interceptions was second-best
in the Big East last, season,
hurt his. ankle early in last
week’s game. Majors said his
status is day-to-day, or week-
to-week.

On the other side of the
ball, the Panthers are without

Pitt Bulls hungry to sink their teeth into Eagles‘ flesh

nite1y.' Making the situation
worse, Pitt has no notable
back to replace him.

“We have a severe depth
problem there,” Majors said.

,It’s doubtful that either of
the backups, senior Chris
Patton or freshman
Demetrius Harris, will fill
West’s void like West did
when Curtis Martin went
down with an ankle injury in
the second game last year -
against Ohio University, a
MAC team, nonetheless.

Without West, the offensive
burden will fall on senior
quarterback John Ryan and
his talented receiving corps.
Ryan sputtered early last
week, tossing three intercep-
tions, but bounced back to
orchestrate two fourth-quar-
ter touchdowns and, conse-
quently, a 17-13 Pitt win.

. “John Ryan threw a couple
interceptions that proved to
be very costly,” Majors said.
“But he has terrific tough-
ness, intelligence and knows
our offense through and
through. He doesn’t get rat-
tled. And as a result, he
helped us come back twice in
the fourth quarter.” '

And with the major offen-
sive cog on the sidelines,
“The Pitt Bulls” will have to
guard their territory a tad bit
closer. But according to
Tumulty, that shouldn’t be a
problem.

“We got to get on them
quick and shut ‘em down,”
Tumulty said.

Although Eastern Michigan
isn’t as juicy as Washington
State, it's still ﬂesh.

- Has the real Eagle landed for
EMU’s football team?

Rick Rasnick, former offensive
coordinator for the Utah Utes, takes
over a helm guided more often by a
stranger to the EMU players than a
familiar face in the past four years.

Just when the players were getting
used to former Coach Ron Cooper’s
antics, he jumped ship in the offsea-
son to Louisville. Cooper was a
yeller, a screamer and a rah-rah type
of coach built on emotion.

Here comes the contrast in
Rasnick, and with it, players, fans
and administration hope the new
head coach can add some stability to
a program that has had four head
coaches in a four-year span. ,

Trace the lineage: Jim Harkema
resigned mid-season in 1991, Jan
Quarless took over as interim,
Cooper entered and led the Eagles
to 4-7 and 5-6 in 1993 and 1994
and finally here comes Rasnick in
1995.,

Anybody need a recap?

The players say it is now more of
a players’ team heading into 1995,
but whether that translates to suc-
cess on the field is a question mark.

"‘That’s the main attitude change
that could help our team,” said
defensive tackle Kevin

Kwiatkowski, one of the four team
captains. “Coaches are important
because they organize the game, but
the players play it. Rasnick has
brought the attitude of ‘If it isn’t
broken, don’t fix it’ — the players
respect that.”

Critics of the Eagles and their five
straight losing seasons may feel oth-
erwise, but Rasnick has brought in a
vaunted offensive attack, he said,
which just may

The 5—foot—5-inch Clay, a second-
team All—MAC selection, won the
NCAA Division I-A punt return title
last year with 14 returns for 278

personnel.

Despite finishing seventh in over-
all offense, the offense has a deep
group of talented receivers and a
solid quarterback in Charlie Batch,
whom Rasnick said is a true talent.

Batch, who blistered the Toledo
Rockets for 19-of-26 for 308 yards
and three touchdowns in the final
game last season, had a superb
spring and cemented the fact EMU
won’t have a quarterback controver-
sy. Backing up Batch will be senior

The offensive line should be a

returnees. Rasnick said Stokes has
NFL potential. Junior center Matt
Gregory and junior tackle Frank
Rocca return, while Mike Lightner
and Mike Erickson hope to step in as
starters at the tackle and guard spots
respectively.

The defense for the Eagles is a bit
more suspect than the offensive side
of the ball. Five starters return,
including middle linebacker Reese
McCaskill, who has started all 33
games during his three-year career.

Butqthere’s no question the EMU
defense will be built around
Kwiatkowski, who finished fourth in
the conference in tackles-for-loss
with 13 for 59 yards.

Senior defensive end James Lowe
also returns, while sophomore Avery
Brown and junior George Douglas
look to fill in the other defensive
line spots. ’

Rasnick said depth in this area is a
serious problem.

The secondary, burned for numer-
ous big plays in 1995, should
be improved with two starters
returning in junior Rodney Nubin
and senior Eric Thompson. An
added boost will be the return of

senior cornerback Maurice Reed, «-

who started all 11 games in 1993 but
missed last season with a knee
injury.

The EMU special teams were hot
and cold last year, with the hot being
Clay’s returns and the cold being
EMU’s kicking game.

Senior Jay Gardziola will again
handle the punting duties, while the
placekicking is still up for grabs.
Junior Carson Green and freshman
Justin Ventura will battle for the
duties.

Rasnick said he is going to build
this program from the bottom -up and
take every Saturday as it comes.
“Being the best they can be” is what
Rasnick said. “It would be ridicu-
lous to say we" are going to be ll-O.
We are going to concentrate on
every Saturday and take care of
business.”

Sumner makes switch from free safety to linebacker

By Brad Isles
Sports Editor

College football teams
aren’t allowed to make

with positions.

game for the Panthers at
free safety.

backer, even though he has
never played the position
in a game that counts.

“Even when I was in high
school,I always wanted to
play linebacker,” Sumner
said. “When I got here, I
thought of playing safety
and I just stuck with it for
a while.

secondary because it was

very demanding, that’s why
I played there. Only certain
people can play there.”

In his three years, the 6-
'2, 205-pound safety proved
he was more than capable
of playing in the sec-
ondary.

In his freshman campaign
he played in all ll games,
starting the last three of
the year. and finished with
52 tackles and three inter-
ceptions. He was named to
the Football News’ third-
team freshman All-
America squad.

Sumner didn’t slow down
his sophomore year, play-
ing in 10 games, starting
eight. He finished fourth
on the team with 71 tackles
(41 solo), and had three
interceptions.

Last year he finished
third on the team with 79
total tackles, 59 of which
were solo stops. He also
scored Pitt’s first touch—
down off an interception
since 1991, with a 28-yard
scamper against Temple.

But now it’s a new year
and a new position.

Sumner said that he will
be able to do more for the
team being closer to the
ball. The new position will
allow him to make more
plays than he would have
at safety.

“I like to get more into
the game, rather than just
having to react.” Sumner
said. ‘‘I’d rather just be up
in the middle of the action.
Playing outside linebacker
allows me to do that.”

Sometimes, when moves
are made with impact play-
ers, it is done against their
will. This was not the case
with Sumner, who played
linebacker for the first time
in April during spring
drills.

“I like the way it was
handled,” he said. “Coach
[Chuck] Driesbach, the
defensive coordinator, kept
telling me that they were
looking at maybe moving
me, but they never really
forced it upon me.

“At first I was kind of
hesitant. Then, they told
me the good points and bad,
points that would occur out
of the switch. I thought
about it some more, but
ultimately it was my deci-
sion.

“It wasn’t like it was
forced upon me,” Sumner
added. “If I wanted to stay
at safety, I still could’ve
stayed there. I gave [line-
backer] a try in the spring
and really enjoyed it a lot.”

Sumner enjoyed it
enough to have a nine-
tackle, one-sack perfor-
mance in the annual Blue-
Gold scrimmage and come
out of the spring projected
as a starter.

Sumner will now play
alongside fellow “Pitt
Bulls” Tom Tumulty and
Jon McCray. But, being
thrust into the starting line-
up of perhaps one of the
best linebacking crews in
the nation is not too much
for him to handle.

“The linebackers are a
really tight group. We try
to look out for each other,”
he said. “I think that the
linebackers seem to be
tighter than most because
they have to work well
with the secondary and the
defensive line. Because
we’re in the middle, we
have to be in touch with,
them.”

Sumner made an imn._...ii'ate
impression on linebacker
coach, Bob Babich, namely
with his quickness.

“It’s a big time move,
we’re very excited about
it,” Babich said. “It gives
us a lot of speed we need
to win football games. He’s
an impact player that adds
another dimension.”

Naturally, speed is an

“Bring Your Own Rig
Nite.” Finally the Eagles
travel to Kent. This team
is so bad that Ohio made it
drop “State” from its
name.

Temple would finish 9-2
with this schedule.
Advantage: Pitt

Best Name — Zatiti
Moody vs. Justin Ventura

You all saw it coming,
so get used to it. Against
many teams Zatiti would
win, but Justin “The
Body” Ventura runs away
with this race. Before the
7 p.m. kickoff, Ventura
will request a moment of
silence from the crowd in
memory of his fallen
friend Dino Bravo.
Advantage: Eastern
Michigan

The undercard has a
great flyweight matchup:
Sadiq Durham vs. Steve
Clay. At 5-6, 150 pounds,
Durham, who was given a
scholarship last Thursday
by Majors, will tower over
Clay, 5-5 140. Gary
Coleman was suspended
from the team by Rasnick
for breaking team rules.
Note: Clay is now dating
Dana Plato.

John Jenkins ruined my
prediction last week by
stealing the spotlight from
Eric Kasperowicz. This
week will belong to
Demetrius Harris and Tom
Tumulty. Harris will score
three times and Tumulty
will have the game of his
life. Pitt 38-EMU 13.

frequently in the first half,
trying to find the combina-
tion that could convert on
the opportunities present-
ed to them. . '

When asked why he
subbed so frequently in
the first half as compared
to the second, Luxbacher
replied, “I subbed up front
[in the first half]. In the
second half we played bet-
ter, and so they stayed in.”

The Panthers kept the
Rockets off the score-
board, but their best
defense was their offense,
which limited the Rockets
to only three shots on
goal. Adam Spitzer picked
up his first shutout of the
season in relatively easy
fashion.

Coach Luxbacher said of
Spitzer, “He wasn’t tested
much, but he did what he
had to do.”

Senior Captain J.L.
Gorsin paced the Panthers
with three shots on goal,
followed by Todd Graf and
Drew Kopp, who had two
each.

The Panthers next travel
to SUNY-Buffalo on
Saturday before kicking
off their conference sched-
ule at Providence on Sept.

wideouts running down the
sidelines.

But speed is also an inte-
gral part of playing line-
backer. The faster he gets
around the offensive line-
men, the faster he gets to
the running back, or even
the quarterback.

“I like to run, even if I
don’t make the tackle,”
Sumner said. “I like being
around the play.

Linebacker allows me to"

do that, to be more of the
player that I am. I want to
try and make plays.”

Increasing his speed,
along with increasing his
strength, were two things
Sumner worked on during
the offseason.

“At first I didn’t know if
I should focus on one of
those, but I tried to split it
up,” he said.

Sumner said he feels
relaxed at the new position
and he isn’t the kind of
person to get real nervous
about things, unless he
really doesn’t know what
he is doing.

“As of right now, I’m a
little wishy-washy because
we’ve had a couple of
months off since spring,”
he said. “Everything has to
be recycled again in my
mind.”

But, after he gets the
two weeks of'fall camp
under his belt, Sumner
should be able to find his
comfort zone on the out-
side.

“Right now, one of my
things is reading if it’s a
run or pass first,” he said.
“Primarily they want me
to play the run, but be able
to help in the passing
game. That’s why they put
me there.”

It is likely that other
teams will try to go right
at Sumner knowing that he
is playing a new position.
He said he welcomes the
challenge.

“I look forward to it. I
like the fact that it’s a
challenge,” Sumner said.
“They’re challenging me
now personally, and I’d be
the first one to be ready to
go when the time comes.

“If they decide to come
my way, then so be it.”

Sumner only sees the
switch as a positive move
for the Panthers, a team he
feels will open some peo-
ple’s eyes this season.

“We have a lot of seniors
on this team that have
played a lot of games,” he
said. “I think it’s definite-
ly going to" be a good year
for Pitt football. As far as
the rebuilding situation
goes, the experience is
going to help us out, not
only with the youth, but
help us win games.”

There is no doubt that
Sumner’s “trade” to line-
backer will be a key factor
for the Panthers‘ hopes of
making it to a bowl game

Training that builds
your character,

 

confidence and decision-
making skills. Again,
words other courses sel-
dom use. But they're the
