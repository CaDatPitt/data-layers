E EIGHTY-FOUR, ISSUE TWENIIY-SDVC

By Lou Grieco

The Pitt News

Phil Hilt had just beaten his
last opponent by 65 points,
when he was strapped to the
“Wheel of Jeopardy” and spun
at33 1/3 revolutions per minute.
Ten correct identifications of
performers in music videos later,
he earned his way to New York
City, to be a contestant on MTV ’s
popular game show “Remote
Control.”

“I’ve always wanted to go to
New York,” he said. “Now I can
go, and it will all be paid for.
, This is great.”

Hilt was one of four
contestants from Pitt selected to
compete in a special version of
Remote Control, “The Out of
the Basement Tour,” which
featured appearances by hosts
Ken Ober and Colin Quinn, last
night at Carnegie Music Hall.
The show was not taped.

The contestants had to answer
television trivia questions from
categories like the Elvis
‘Network, the Flintstones,
Batman and Stud Boy. At one
point, when the category was
“How dumb can you be?, Ober
asked the question “For five

points, what kind of underwear
are you wearing today?”

One of the contestants, Rob
Grant, alias Dudley, quickly hit
his buzzer and spouted out “That
would be Rocky and Bulwinkle
Boxers I have on right now.”
Then he had to prove it by
pulling down his pants for the
audience.

“You’re a brave man, Dudley,”
Ober quipped. “Five points the

MTV's game show
makes Oakland stop

hard way, no pun intended.”
Dudley will also be sporting a

new haircut around campus,

courtesy of hostess Tracy Warbin.

Instead of a question, Ober V

offered points to the contestant
who would let Warbin, who he
said just completed “barber
school,” try out her newly
acquired skills on his or her scalp.
Dudley paid with a blonde lock
of hair off of the right side of his
head.

Another dumb question simply
asked the contestants to burp.

First to hit the buzzer and belch _

wasJames “J.D.” Davis, who later

came in second, losing in the ‘

final “Lightening Round.”

“What can I say?” Davis said
after the show. “The experience
of being here was exhilarating.
This is one night I’ll never forget.”

Ober said that the contestants
were the perfect mix. .“We had
the undisciplined Dudley, who
needs electric shock therapy. J.D.
was funny,Jen [Netzer] was sweet.

“And of course, Phil was from
another planet. New York City is
ready for Phil.”

There is not an exact date
planned for Hilt’s appearance on
the television show, though he
said that he was told the taping
may be done in January or

 There IQ hﬁ Qﬂf Plato Frxr
when it will be aired.

Colin Quinn’ the announcer’ "Dudley" (Rob Grant) gets a haircut from hostess Tracy Warbin. I

got the most applause when the
category selected was “Sing Along
With Colin.” In a monotone, tinted
with a Brooklyn accent, Quinn
went on to garble his way through
GreatWhite’s “Once Bitten, Twice
Shy” and U2’s version of “Helter
Skelter,” with the contestants
supplying the titles.

Quinn admitted that his voice
was like the sound made when
someone “stepped on T om Waits
cat.”

Hostess Warbin, a veteran of

“Club MTV,” said that she didn’t\

mind wearing her skimpy outfit,
consisting of blackleather jacket,

leather brassiere, and skin—tight
jeans.

“This is nothing,” she said. ‘‘I
usually wear rubber pants and
see—through dresses.”

“It’s kind oflike being in a Cher
video,” she said. ‘‘I like to play off
of the guys in the audience. If

Jon Anderson/The Pitt News

there aren’t many guys, I don’t
have as good of a night.”
Quinn also said that he liked
performing in front ofa bigger
crowd than in the television
studio. “We’re used to 80
people. There must have been
1500 here tonight. It’s killer.”

§ The Black Action Society

elebrated their annual cultural
day with a lecture last night about
developing a black liberated
culture.

Dr. Jawanza Kunjufu, an
education consultant from
Chicago who headlined the event,
stressed blacks to be “competent,
confident, and committed” in their
daily lives.

He also encouraged people to
pay attention to the “haves and
have—nots” of the world. “The
haves of the world have skills
but no guts, while the have—nots
have guts but no skills," he told
the crowd of about 250.

He pointed out that John
;fackson, a Chicago businessman,
is one of the 400 richest men in

the world, yet “has done nothing
to liberate his community.”

Kunjufu told the audience that
blacks should take racism as an
incentive to '

musical ‘selection from Rerna
Webb and Todd I/edbetter. Patrice
Bates, a gospel singer from Some
of God’s Children, and Andrea
Humphrey also were asked to

Outing with ROTC proves more than justmtmeuvers

nBy Karen Speece

Staff Writer

woke to the familiar sound

of my alarm clock. Saturday
morning, 5 a.m., time to get up.
After a- brief shower, I donned
several layers of clothing and
headed out to meet the cold,
dark street on my way to the

1.“-Steven Foster Memorial..

As the sun slowly began to rise
over The Carnegie Museum, I
met about 70 cold ROTC cadets,
most of them groggy, but eager
to get to West Virginia and go
rappelling. I noted that Paul
Diamond, the photographer, and
I were practically the only ones
who weren’t wearing fatigues.

Q Suddenly, the jeans and sweatshirt

I was wearing just didn’t seem to
fit the picture correctly.

After boarding the warm bus,
everyone seemed to wake up a
bit, and the bus was quite lively
with people laughing and talking.

When we arrived in West
Virginia, and neared our site,
everyone noticed an inviting;
rapidly ﬂowing river on the left
side of the bus, one that would
be perfect for white-water rafting,

‘band the natural, beauty of the

trees and forests that West Virginia
is known for.

We turned off the main road,
onto a steep, rocky path with a
beautiful‘ brook at its side. We
noticed that the brook had several
waterfalls which grew more and

. A .more lovely as the bus climbed

I‘
I

higher up the mountain.

Finally we reached our site, a
large cliff with a jagged, rocky
face. The cliff extended from a
50-foot drop to a 100-foot drop
that seemed to beckon and dare
the cadets as they got off the bus.

Lt. Col. Geoghagan briefed the
cadets on rappelling safety and
told them, “You’ll die from a 10-
foot fall, or an 80- foot fall; the
only difference is the time, so be
careful.”

Secured by two overhand knots,

. a square knot, two half hitches

and a slip hook around their
waists, the cadets put on thick
leather gloves and “steel pot”
hats to protect their hands and
head while they were going over
the cliff.

After climbing up the side of
the cliff, we were ready to go.
Some quite scared, some anxious.
All, nevertheless, were ready for
whatever awaited.

As one of the first cadets started
over the face, a member of the
Ranger Team asked her if she
was scared. She said, “No, I'm not
scared, I think its just
apprehension.” The Cadet Ranger
replied, “Okay then, get off my
cliff!” I

At the bottom of the cliff,
another cadet said, “I can call
home now and say, ‘Hey mom, I
rappelled!”?

As one of the cadets was
rappelling, a large piece of rock

came off of the face, and fell I

about three feet from the person

who was on belay below him. No
one was hurt, but I can imagine
how that could shake someone
up.

When I went to rappel, thoughts
of all the other faces I’d been
over crossed my mind. This face
was unlike any of the others. It
was a ‘bit more jagged, and
suddenly seemed more
challenging. The view over my
shoulder as I went down the face
was excellent.

At lunch time, everyone
received an MRE (Meal Ready to
Eat). There were several different

Brothers Dunlap

varieties ranging from what is
commonly known as “meat wads”
in barbecue sauce, turkey chunks
in gravy, beans in tomato sauce
with frankfurters, ham and
chicken, chicken ala king, and
about four others. i

The first thing everyone did
when they opened their MRE
was go through all of the different
little packets and see what fun
stuff they received. Everyone had
an “accessories packet” which
contained a wide variety of items
like cofee, candy, gum, sugar,
dehydrated catsup, matches and

toilet paper.

These meals were generally
okay, but I think they would
have been better if they had been
heated up. I had the turkey in
what tasted like a cornstarch slime.
I considered myself lucky as I
watched Paul eat the cold beans
in tomato sauce. The saltines were
really good, as was the dried
fruit. ,

Cadet 1st Lt. Jeff Kaminski told
me, “you just have to know how

to eat [an MREI,” as he mixed his

continued the legacy of frustrated,
metallic, beat—box guitar abuse.
The sound was anything but
psychedelic.

Rapeman has since dissolved,
but Albini is still active in his
community’s cultural atmosphere,
producing records, - eating steak
and black onions and being
annoying.

Two of his recent production

projects are quite notable and

coincidentally will be appearing
in our very own post-industrial
town. These said projects are The
Jesus Lizard and Flour.

The Jesus Lizard is made of '
singer David Yow, formerly of’

Scratch Acid; bassist David Wm.

Sims, also from Scratch Acid and.

Rapeman; and Duane Denison,

Cargo Cult’s old guitarist. Their:

noise guitar,

disturbed vocals, tinny bass and
that drum machine. The songs
are all good, a bit more arranged,
but not quite as imposing as
Albini’s legacies. A drummer, Mac
McNeilly (from 86 and Phantome
309) will be touring with them as
well as joining them for future
recordings.

That leaves us with Flour. Flour
is Pete Conway, former bassist
for Riﬂe Sport, an underrated
world-music group and Breaking
Circus, a Homestead—meets-
Touch & Go-halfway noise group.
His debut LP released last year on
Touch & G0 was recorded in
Steve Albini’s basement with all
instruments /(guitars, bass,
accordion, and drum machine)
being played by Flour. His songs
are almost meditations on pop-
song form with some healthy
doses of sandblaster guitar
barging in and out of the rough
mix.

The record has an intro and an
outro, sort of a do-it-yourself

concept record about love and ,

bloody food. The highlight would
have to be “Accordian,” a simple
tune featuring some sublime

Schmenge Brothers meets the

Beatles riffs by Pete, a former
orchestra French horn player and
polka-band accordionist Nice
stuff despite the weak beats.

Anyway, Flour is touring with a  

band, including not only a
drummer, but none other than
Steve Albini himself on bass. No
matter what you think of these
records or Albini, this show is a

must-see since that Texas meets A

Pacino and supporting cast standout in Sea of Love

Scot Ross

..r»Managing Editor

To create a quality film, it is
necessary to blend a strong and
intriguing script with an equally
able cast of characters. In “Sea of
Love,” the weak story line offers
a lopsided chariot that rolls along
until the climax, where it finally
crashes to the ground.

The shame of this is that the
film is for the most part
captivating, with impressive
performances by Al Pacino, Ellen
Barkin and John Goodman. As
well, Richard Price’s script
includes entertaining dialogue,
allowing Pacino and Goodman
to emerge as a crime—fighting
unit, complete with laughable
wit and street-wise know-how.

As police officers from
Manhattan and Queens, Pacino
and Goodman join together to
solve a string of patterned murders
which involve philandering,
personal advertising and poetry.

The opening scene typiﬁes the
humor, as well as the negligence,
of the movie. Crowds of men

, pour into a room, supposedly
attending by invitation only, a
New York Yankee autograph

.  signing session. Pacino does a

Phil Rizzuto imitation when asked
who he is. It’s funny. But then,
and similarly throughout the film,

the session turns out to be a front
for something else. This one
happens to be a swooping arrest
of these felons. And even more
contrived is the officers filling all
of the criminals’ orange juice
glasses to toast Pacino’s 20th year
on the force.

For the first of many times in
the movie, the audience is asking
questions. Why, if the police had
the addresses to the criminals’
homes, didn’t they arrest them
there, instead of putting them all
into a room with the chance of an
all—out riot? Why, because in Price
and director Harold Becker’s
world, New York City felons sit
down when police accost them.

Price also offers a bit of

foreshadowing when a man trots ’

up with his young son after the
arrest, explaining he is late. Pacino
looks at the son and quickly
finding that he is only wanted for
stealing a couple of cars, ﬂashes
his badge and says there was a
mistake. The criminal
acknowledges Pacino’s gesture,

Al is endeared to the audience
and the movie goes on. This is a
nice thing to see in cinema, but
when it is the root of a character’s
personality, as it turns out to be in
Pacino’s character when Ellen
Barkin becomes a suspect in the
case, it is unforgivable.

The real story line begins with
a man pseudo—seducing his bed
at gunpoint. The teary-eyed man
turns to his aggressor and is shot.
Phil Phillips’ “Sea of Love” is
playing in the background. Over
and over again.

The ﬁlm has a dark comic side
to it. Following the first shooting,
Pacino, bitter over the fact that
another officer from his precinct
married his ex—wife, calls his wife
in the wee hours, waking the
officer as well. Trying the first of
several reconciliations with the
man, Pacino offers his hand in
apology. The two shake over the
corpse.

Through a series of

‘investigations, Pacino and

By Dmitri Ragano
Asst. Showcase Editor

“Justice and the law may be
distant cousins,” a renegade
lawyer tells the main character of
the film “A Dry White Season,”
“but in South Africa they are not
on speaking terms.” '

The speaker of these lines is

none other than 65-year-old
Marlon Brando, a "distinguishing
strength ofthis film on apartheid.
Director Euzhan Palcy coaxed
the human rights activist and star
of “The Godfather,” “Last Tango
in Paris” and “A Streetcar Named
Desire” out of a decade-long
retirement to do this cameo for

no pay.

As a crafty barrister who knows
he can’t win his fight against the
South African government,
Brando brings zest and humor to
“A Dry White Season” and proves
his legendary genius hasn’t
deserted him (although the media
seems unable to do anything more

intelligent than comment on his
weight). '

“A Dry White Season” offers
another surprise: it’s amazing that
its director Palcy — a young
black woman from the island of
Martinique — was allowed into
the lily—white Hollywood system.
I wish “A Dry White Season” had
been less of a Hollywood ﬁlm.

Like its predecessors (“Cry
Freedom,” “A World Apart”), this
film on South Africa has a white
man in the lead role. Donald

Du Toit is in disbelief when his
gardener’s son is lashed by the

police. Later, the son is killed in ,
a protestbroken up by the police. : '~

When du Toit and his gardener
investigate, the gardener is taken
in by the government’s
treacherous Special Branch. Soon
after, du Toit learns that the
gardener has “committed suicide”
while in detention.

All of this leads du Toit to
believe that the South African

government is doing some very . 

bad things. Apparently this
revelation had eluded him his
entire life, until now. Now he’s
willing to sacrifice everything to
bring justice to his gardener’s
killer.

moving bit in which we cutback
and forth between du Toit’s cozy
household’ and a government
torture chamber. Brando’s
courtroom interlude is the best
part of the ﬁlm; it’s the only thing
that approaches inspired drama.

Thesecond half of the movie is
rather ﬂat. Once du Toit emerges
as the great white hero with a
mission, the film has all the
dramatic richness of a Hardy Boys
episode. The flaccid script moves
the narrative along like a game of
connect the dots. We keep
hearing lines, that make the
characters seem like cliches that
only exist in the heads of liberal
ﬁlmmakers. . —

Despite the hype and good

intentions behind these anti-'

apartheid films we’ve been
seeing, it’s not hard to believe

  
  

 
  
  

   

that there’s never been a really

good film on apartheid. The‘ A

makers of these ﬁlms have no
real insight into the South African
psyche and way of life (be it
black or white), so they end up

churning out characters that are E

stereotypes and scenarios that
are morality plays. No wonder
they've failed. I

How can they make good films
on .a sociew and phenomenon
that’s’ totally alien to them? (Try to

picture a Frenchman or Italian

making a ﬁlm on American race
relations with the power and
complexity of “Do the Right
Thing. ”)

Palcy’s a filmmaker with some
guts and talent; let's hope she
gets another chance. As for now,
I liked “A Dry White Season,” but
it’s nothing I haven't seen before.

Goodman discover that several

the dead all placed poems in the

series of encounters with the
women who answer the poem,
Ellen Barkin emerges and like
clockwork, everyone in the theater,
everyone in the movie and
everyone with a glimmer of
intelligence is screaming, “Yes,
yes, we have a suspect. One way
or another she is involved.”

But true to the movie, Price and
Becker don't have Pacino believe
she could be holding back. Even
when the evidence is stacked
against Barkin and Pacino ﬁnally
loses his cool, he_ yells at her in a
manner which she thinks shows

jealousy, not that this has anything I

to do with a murder investigation.

The climax is equally as jumbled,
coming out of the cheap seats in

reminiscent of “Tootsie,” except‘

it’s a Phil Phillips song and not
Stephen Bishop that's sung during

It is too bad that Pacinofs return

Pacino, see the ﬁlm. Watch him,

leave the theater, resist the
temptation to discuss . the
ridiculousness of the ending and it

Ratio on the tracks “What Is A
Linz?” and “False Prophets” to the
churning guitar and squonky sax
like Last Exit on “Mama Tengo."
The lighter side of the band comes
out on “Song,” artful pop
somewhat similar to the
Legendary Pink Dots.

In their hometown of Linz, the
trio has participated regularly in
the futuristic Ars Electronica
festival, as well as other new
music gatherings such as Festival
Nova in Zaragoza, Spain and Trans
Europe in Vienna. They have
toured Germany and their native
land.

Vocalist and keyboardist

Wolfgang Dorninger and guitarist.

Peter Androsch are also members

of the avant—garde group Josef K.
Noyce, who released a new album
on Recommended Records.
Also performing on Sunday is
local experimental group The
Year Zero, who are former and
current students from, Mount
Lebanon High School. They have
altered their tribal electronic
sound since their performance at
Sonic Turmoil, adding a
performance artist and other
surprises, and will release their
first cassette The Lim'ngMound at
the show.

Wilhelm Hartmann is excited
about the impending arrival of
Monochrome Bleu. “It’s a great
privilege for us to be able to
present artists of international

stature at the space, and also
provide a place for local
experimental musicians to try out
their ideas. The neighborhood is
very supportive of our efforts,
and the audience has been
appreciative.”

While attending the performance,
art lovers can check out the
newest exhibition at the gallery,
featuring interesting and
challenging works by Ben Carter
and Jeff Katrencik. Refreshments
will be served. T b e
sbow begins at 8p. m. and is open
to all ages. The Turmoil Room is
located at 704 S. Trenton Ave. in
Willeinsburg. and the 61A/B drops
you oﬁ’ three blocks away on
Forbes Avenue and Braddock:

televised contest against Notre

“Navy in the past has beaten
us,” Huebner stated. “They always
seem to play us tough. They’re an
outstanding team and they’re
disciplined, and I have no doubt
that this game is going to be a
dogﬁght”

For the first time this year,
Pitt must face a wishbone offense,
which basically features three
running backs in the backfield
and an option—type attack.

The closest Pitt has come to
that style ofplay came in their 50-
23 Syracuse win, as the Panthers
shut down Dick McPherson’s
option game.

“We expect that Navy is going
to be a tough ballgame,” Panther
head coach Mike Gottfried said at
his weekly press luncheon. “I
think they’re going to come in
here ready to play.

Chris Bosak
. Last Week 6-7

Season 40-25

What can I say about a 6-7
week? If you recall, I picked a lot
of upsets; yes, I did get the Tampa
Bay over Chicago pick, but the
rest of them didn’t come through.
Back to the basics this week.

Pittsburgh at Cleveland: I
have about as much faith in Todd
Blackledge quarterbacking as I
do about Aaron Jones not getting

‘in a ﬁght during this game.
' Cleveland will rebound from last

week’s loss.

Detroit at Tampa Bay: The
Bucs made me look good last
week so I’ll stick with them this
game. Besides the Lions are
simply terrible.

Green Bay at Minnesota: The
Vikings can never beat the
Packers. Last year the Packers
cost the Vikes a divisional
championship, but it won’t
happen this year; Minnesota
doesn't have an offense, but their
defense is incredible. Vikings.

Houston at Chicago: I can’t
go against the Bears two weeks
in a row, however much I would
like to.

Indianapolis at Denver: I like
the Colts, but I just don’t trust
them. Despite their impressive

win last week, they will lose this
week to the Broncos.

Kansas City at LA Raiders:
Just think, a couple of years ago,
people used to look forward to
this game. Now this matchup
rivals the Green Bay/ Detroit
games for the worst of the year.
Take the Chiefs.

Miami at Cincinnati: I don’t
know how the Dolphins keep
winning without a defense. The
Bengals are solid and will take it.

New England at Atlanta:
There is no possible way to make

a logical pick in this one. Atlanta '

is on the rise, but not there yet,
and New England is one the way

, down, but didn’t hit bottom yet.

Take the Falcons at home.
NY Jets at New Orleans: Both

Pregame, THE PITI‘ NEWS, Thurday, October 12, 1989

of these teams are on the way
down, but look for the Saints to
rise again.

Philadelphia at Phoenix:
Take the Eagles with Randall.
The Cardinals just don’t have it.
‘ San Francisco at Dallas: Last
week was my week to take the
Cowboys, probably never again.
San Fran big. A

Seattle atsan Diego: These
teams play so inconsistently from

Last Week 9-4

 

e consensus is: Cleveland over the Bubby-less Steelers

Season 39-26

What can I say? How about those
two 9-4 weeks back to back? Let's
go for a third one, 9~4 at least.

Pittsburgh at Cleveland:
Bubby may play this week, but
it's a shame he got hurt just as

things were beginning to fall into”

State. Enough said. Browns.
Detroit at Tampa Bay: Vinnie

with the Bucs against an extremely
lame Detroit squad.

Bears must be smarting badly
after losing to the Bucs. They will
take revenge this week against a
disappointing Oiler squad.

Indianapolis at Denver: This
is a tough one to call, but I say
Denver will take it against the
Colt squad.

Kansas City at LA Raiders:
After watching the biggest yawner
of a Monday night game in years,
I just can’t take Art Shell this
week. Chiefs to romp. ~

Miami at Cincinnati: Darin

parade this week in the jungle.

Newlingland atAtlanta: I dig
the Falcons. Atlanta to win big.

NY Jets at New Orleans: I
cannot pick the Jets for the same

reason I cannot pick the Raiders, q

Monday night. Saints to emerge
victorious.

Philadelphia at Phoenix: An
easyone! Philly to crush. I was
just in Philly, great cheese steaks!

San Francisco at Dallas: Oh

please! The Giants, oh sorry, that’s
my Series pick, I mean the ‘Niners
to win by exponential
proportions.

Seattle at San Diego: I like the
Chargers in this one, I don’t know
why.

Washington at’ NY Giants:
Definitely the contest of the week.
Look for the Giants to beat the

is that I think everyone should

it the proper way. I
“The concern of Bob
Valesente (Pitt’s defensive
coordinator), myself, and the
other coaches is that they had
215 rushing yards against a very
good Air Force team last week,”
Gottfried said.
Navy quarterback Alton

Grizzard will lead the wishbone '

on Saturday. Last week, he racked
up 168 yards on the ground and
threw for another 63 against Air
Force —-— enough to earn him
ECAC Division .I—A Offensive
Player of the Week honors.
Navy coaches also have not
ruled out the possibility that
backup Gary McIntosh, who
supposedly has a better arm than
Grizzard, will see some action.
Rodney Purifoy is the leading

rusher with 527 yards for the
Midshipmen. He will be joined
by James Bradley, Don Ferraro,
and Xwamie Mouitrie in the
backfield throughout the contest.

Navy’s biggest problem has
not been moving the ball, but
rather crossing the white line of
their opponent’s end zone.

“We move down the field but
when we get into the scoring
zone, we don’t punch it in,” Navy
head coach Elliot Uzelac said.

Defensively, defensive back
Bob Weissenfies leads Navy with
39 tackles, and is followed closely
by middle guard Andy Kirkland.
Linebacker Mark Ellis has led his
team in tackles against Air Force.

Overall, Navy has done a
fairly good job against the run,
holding opponents to a 59-yard
average so far
Opponents have been able to
beat them in the air, however.

Uzelac feels that his team did

this year. ’

not play well against Air Force
and is looking for a much better
effort this weekend.

“I think Air» Force did an
outstanding job of attacking our
defense. I don’t think our defense
did as well as it did in the first
three games and we got hurt at
times by the play from our
linebackers and defensive backs,”
Uzelac said.

Pitt’s offense will be led by
redshirt freshman Alex Van Pelt,
who has completed 62.6 percent
of his passes so far this season for
1,210 yards and eight
touchdowns. Van Pelt already
has two 330-plus yard passing
games this year. To put that. in
proper perspective, Dan Marino
had three during his entire Pitt
career.

Gottfried’s major headache
this week is the running back
situation. Curvin Richards (437
yards on the ground so far this
season) is still nursing a groin
injury that limited his playing
time against Temple. Adam

Walker stepped in against the
Owls and accumulated 82 yards
on 13 carries, so chances are
good that he will see extended
playing time against Navy.

The top two fullbacks, Derrick
Lewis and Ronald Redmon, may
not be able to play, leaving huge
freshman Jimmer Bundy (5’11",
240 pounds) as the possible
starter.

Gottfried grew disenchanted
with his much—publicized
platoon-defensive line system
against Temple and ‘cut the
substitutes play considerably in
that contest. However, he ‘still
feels that he has eight very capable
linemen.

“I was upset because when
we put them in there was a 10-
yard gain right away,” Gottfried
said. “I just felt that they had to
come into the game ready to
play, so we yanked them after
that,” Gottfried said.

“But we still will substitute.
We'll either do it by units like we
have been or do it by positions.”

Defensive tackle Marc Spindler
is the leading Panther tackler so
far this year with 39, while end
Keith Hamilton has 5.5 sacks.

Robert Bradley came on and
picked off two Victory Lay passes
in the Temple contest after having
a tough game against Syracuse.

Because this is the last meeting
between the two teams for a long
period of time, Huebner feels

there will be another added, ..

motivational factor besides just 8
trying to stay undefeated.

“They dropped us from their
schedule, so you always want to
go out with a win whenever you
play a team for the last time,” he
said.

Gottfried indicated that he
wanted to fine-tune his squad for

Saturday’s contest in order to be V. L

successful.

“I was not at all dissatisﬁed
with the way we played against
Temple,” Gottfried said. “But we
do need to clean up some things
in our play before the Navy game.”

Oakland to take ‘series in their second time around

By Adam Kamras
Staff Writer

It’s time once again for the fall
classic known as the World Series.
This year’s contest will be known
as “Bays Ball,” featuring the two
California coast Bay Area teams;
the Oakland Athletics and the
San Francisco Giants. It’s the first
time since 1956, when the New
York Yankees met the Brooklyn
Dodgers, that two teams from the
same metropolitan area are
meeting in the Series.

Well that’s enough talk; let’s

get on with the matchups for the
1989 World Series.

FIRST BASE: Mark McGwire
(A’s); Will Clark (Giants): There
aren’t many first baseman that
would get the nod against the
power hitting McGwire, but then
again, there aren’t many people
like Clark. Clark’s playoff
performance showed why he is
regarded as one of the best at his
position. EDGE: Giants.

SECOND BASE: Tony Phillips
(A’s); Robby Thompson (Giants):
Phillips provided some excellent
defense in the playoffs.

player who showed some power

Thompson to hit a home run in
the bottom of the ninth to see if
the announcer would yell, “The
Giants win the pennant.” SLIGHT
EDGE: Giants.

SHORT STOP: Mike Gallego,
Walt Weiss (A’s); Jose Uribe
(Giants): Gallego’s post season
defense could make him an

Lansford is one of the most
underrated hitters of the decade.
He knows how to take pitches to
let Rickey Henderson steal bases.
It is essential for his hamstring to
heal. Williams has shown that his
two month power surge was no

RBI’s. He also showed very well

is probably still seeing him steal
bases in his sleep. Mitchell had a
good playoff with two home runs.
Neither one of these players will

ever win a gold glove. Whichever ‘

the outcome. EDGE: Even.

out? I’ll give the advantage to
Oakland because_ they have two
good catchers and don't have to
throw out Rickey Henderson.
EDGE: A’s. '

‘ STARTING PIT CHING: Dave
Stewart, Mike Moore, Bob Welch,
Storm Davis (A’s); Scott Garrelts,‘
Rick Reuschel, Mike Lacoss or
Don Robinson (Giants);
Oak1and’s staff is so deep that
they’re one of the few teams that
doesn't go to a three man post-
season rotation. San Francisco,
on the other hand, will need a 1!
quick knee recovery from either
Lacoss or Robinson just to have a
third starter. BIG EDGE: A’s.

MIDDLE RELIEF: Gene Nelson,
Todd Burns, Rick Honeycutt (A’s);
Kelly Downs, Jeff ‘ Brantley
(Giants): The Giant's middle
relievers bailed their starters out
of some tough playoff situations,
but the A’s have one of the deepest
bullpens in baseball. EDGE: A’s

CLOSER: Dennis Eckersley
(A’s); Steve Bedrosian, Craig
Lefferts (Giants); “Bedrock” got
out of some tough jams, but he
also got himself into them. The
A’s probably won’t let himlskate
on thin ice like that. If it weren’t I
for a man named Gibsonﬁ,
Eckersley, they would have a ,
perfect post season record. EDGE:
A’s

BENCH/DH: L All of the
remaining players will be
relegated to pinch hitting or
DHing for the games in Oakland.
Maldonado and Oberkfell can be
tough off the bench; especially
the left handed—hitting Oberkfell
who can be called upon to face
Eckersley. Oakland has used the
DH all year and there aren’t many
bigger threats off the bench than a
Dave Parker. EDGE: A’s.

MANAGER: Tony Larussa (A’s);
Roger Craig (Giants); I’m glad the
announcers finally stopped
reminding us that Larussa went
to law schoo1.‘His team has great
talent, but he is still very good at
handling the diverse personalities
such as Canseco, R. Henderson,
and Eckersley. Craig is a master '
with his pitching staff which will
be needed. He'll also get 0
aggressive and ignore what “the
book” says to do. EDGE: Even.

CONCLUSION: It appears the .
A’s are a team on a mission. After
last year’s upset, they appear as
though nothing will stand in their
way. The big difference will be
the pitching depth of Oakland)
and the mnning of Henderson.

PREDICTION: Oakland in six.
