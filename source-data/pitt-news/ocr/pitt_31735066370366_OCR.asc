Thousands march in protest against racism

By Kathy Stahl
Staff Writer

PHILADELPHIA — Police on mounted
horses were keeping a close eye on the pro-
ceedings at the JFK Plaza in downtown Phil-
adelphia. The tension became apparent as
" and “Beat
back the racist attacks" were shouted by the
masses gathered. The streets were lined with
people holding hands and carrying signs bear-
ing messages of love and freedom.

Despite the cold temperatures, an estimated

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

10,000 people of all ages. ethnic and social
levels joined together at the JFK Plaza to par-
ticipate in a national march against racism.

“Today’s march is a strong and visible stand
against racism and police brutality,” said Ber-
ta Joubert, co-coordinator of the march. “It is
clearly a grassroots effort by community groups
in Philadelphia that has been picked up by
groups nationally."

In the past year-and—a,—half Philadelphia has
received an excessive amount of national atten-
tion due to a surge of racial and minority—related
incidents. According to Phebe Eckfeldt, media

spokeswoman for the National Mobilization
Against Racism. at one point southwest Phila-
delphia had to be declared a state of emergen-
cy because of attacks on black and interracial
families as well as confrontations between the
community and the local police. Because of
such incidents. Philadelphia has become a na-
tional focal point in the struggle against racism.

“Racism is a nationwide issue,“ said Monica
Moorehead, co—chairman of the march. “All
over the country, there has been an escalation
of racist activity which is being generated by
the Reagan administration. The economic con-

MONDAY, FEBRUARY 1 7, I986

dition of minorities has become increasingly
worse because of Reagan‘s policies. His stand
on affirmative action as well as the cuts he pro-
poses for social programs has caused a grow-
ing climate of fear."

Moorehcad said that in Philadelphia the police
are definitely a part of the problem. “They are
not here to protect the people, but rather to op-
press them," Moorehcad said. “We’ve tried
to talk to themabout certain incidents which
we view to be questionable as police brutality

but they refuse to listen."

Rallying students

express their views

PHILADELPHIA — Raising peace
signs and shouting chants, thousands of
protesters trudged through the snow
and slush of downtown Philadelphia
Saturday during the National March
Against Racism.

The event attracted an estimated
10,000 students and .former activists
from around the country, and the at-
mosphere was reminiscent of the stu-
dent unrest in the late 1960s.

Most students participating in the
march said they were concerned with
changing the U.S. policy towards the
apartheid government in South Africa.
The protesters said they could relate the
violence in South Africa to racism on
college campuses.

“God, yes, there is racism at Penn
State,” said PSU freshman Majorie
Devins. “I think the location of Penn
State is a factor. Being in central Penn-
sylvania is a problem‘ because there are
lots of people with very racist at-
titudes.” ‘

Devins was representing the Com-
mittee for Justice in South Africa, a
Penn State student group fighting for
university divestment from companies
doing business in South Africa. Thir-

teen different PSU "student organiza-
tions sent representatives to Philadel-
phia to take part in the march.

Devins said her organization is also
calling for improvements in the treat-
ment of minority students at Penn
State.‘

Jeff Grosky, a protester living in
Philadelphia, suggested racism is hard
to detect in a close but often sterile en-
vironment like college.

“You’re not going to see a lot of
overt racism because people are very
subtle about it, but it’s there,” he said.
“Students are not going to tell anybody
to their faces that they have racist feel-
ings because we are in Philadelphia,

and it’s supposed to be a great.

democratic city.”

Philadelphia was chosen as the place
to hold the march because racial prob-
lems have recently plagued the city. Ci-
ty police had been greatly criticized
since they bombed a building that con-
tained members from the black
organization MOVE, and they have
been widely accused of police brutality.

“We feel Philadelphia is the main
ﬂashpoint for such. a mobilization,”
said Monica Moorehead, co—chair-
person for the National Mobilization
Against Racism.

Man gets real valentine

Surgeons at Presbyterian-University
Hospital yesterday transplanted a
human heart into the chest of the

39-year-old Westmoreland man who

was being kept alive by the Jarvik—7
mechanical heart.

Joseph Burello, a self-employed»

medical supply businessman from New
Alexandria, Pa., was listed in critical
condition yesterday after a 7-and-one-
half hour transplant operation, accord-
ing to hospital spokesman Karen
Lewis. ~

On Feb. 2, Burello had a Jarvik—7
heart implanted as a last chance for sur-
vival until a human heart could be
located.

In July of last year, Burello
developed heart problems. He had been
diagnosed as having ischemic car-
diopyopathy, a deteriorating condition

of the heart muscle caused by harden-

 

ing of the arteries. Burello was
transported and stabilized at a hopital
near his home after suffering from car-
diac arrest in January of this year.
However, his condition began
deteriorating due to embolisms, blood
clots and pulmonary edema. He was
given only 12 to 24 hours to live, so
the decision was made to use the
Jarvik—7 heart as an interim device to
save Burello’s life.

After the implantation of the Jarvik—7
heart. doctors said, “An indeterminate
period of time is necessary for the pa-
tient to recover from the effects of
preoperative poor heart function and
the artiﬁcial heart implantation.” They
continued to say they would not pro-
ceed with a human heart transplanta-
tion until Burello was strong enough.
The average waiting time for donors
has increased from ﬁve days to two
weeks. However, Thomas Gaidosh. the
ﬁrst J arvik-7 recipient at Presby, wait-
-ed only four days for hisdonor organ.

   

Thousands protested in Philadelphia last Saturday against racism.

 

NEA: Budget cuts tohurt education

WASHINGTON — The Reagan ad-
ministration’s proposed budget cuts in
aid to education would, if adopted,
“close the book on the federal commit-
ment to education reform” triggered by
the administration’s own “Nation at
Risk” report, declares the National
Education Association.

“The administration is fond of say-
ing it seeks character, content and
choice in education,” noted NEA
President Mary Futrell, “but this new
budget has no character, little content,
and no choice.”

The administration budget proposals, X

which call for an overall cut of more
than 15 percent in education programs,
were sent to Congress for the 1987
fiscal year Feb. 5.

Futrell said the administration’s pro-
posed education cuts would “sabotage
the education renaissance" President
Reagan lauded in his Feb.4 State of the
Union address. The cuts, Futrell said,
would come at a time when schools can
least afford them.

“The proposed federal education
cuts would force states and local com-
munities to either raise taxes or cut
education programs,” added Futrell.

In the new budget, President Reagan
is asking for about $23 billion in do-
mestic program cuts that affect educa-
tion directly or indirectly _— while add-

ing about $33 billion to military

spending.

The administration suggests reduc-
ing the federal education budget to
$15.2 billion in fiscal 1987. This is
$3.2 billion less thanthe original 1986
education appropriation. In 1985, the
federal government provided $19.1
billion in aid to education.

The administration’s proposed cuts
come on top of $678 million that will
be slashed from federal education pro-
grams March 1 under the Gramm-
Rudman—Hollings budget law. The fed-
eral government’s new ﬁscal year
begins Oct. 1.

Futrell noted that the education share
of the federal budget dollar has shrunk
significantly since the Reagan admin-
istration took ofﬁce in 1981. In 1980,
for every 100 federal budget dollars
spent, $1.10 was spent on elementary
and secondary education. If the ad-
ministration’s budget proposals are
adopted, elementary and secondary
schools would get only 66 cents of
every 100 federal dollars spent — a 40
percent decline.

“Quality education — our greatest
resource and the best investment we
can make to ensure a strong economy
in the future — cannot withstand these
kinds of draconian cuts,” Futrell said.

Futrell pointed out that many states
are now suffering some of the worst
times since the Great Depression as
farm bankruptcies, falling energy
prices (which slice production taxes),

t

and factory closures threaten a decent
standard of living for millions of
Americans. 5

“All is not well out there — despite
the rosy picture the administration at-
tempts to paint of the nation’s economic
landscape,” said Futrell.

The heaviest of the federal education
cuts, Futrell added, would come in

vocational education and in ﬁnancial '

aid for college students.-

Many educational aid programs, in-
cluding general aid (impact aid) for
school districts that have a high con-

' centration of military or other‘ federal

installations, would be eliminated en-
tirely under the administration’s ' 1987
budget proposals.

Most federal education programs,
particularly those programs for elemen-
tary and secondary school children,
provide services to poor, handicapped
and minority children.

The Reagan administration budget
proposal also calls for 1986 rescissions

‘— $1 billion in cuts that will auto-

matically go into effect in 45 days if

Congress fails to act — in vocational ‘ 3

education, college student aid,
libraries, immigrant education and
many other programs.

To make matters worse, Futrell

V noted, the administration is proposing
school vouchers, tuition tax credit and ~ -

other legislation that would weaken

MANILA, Philippines — Thousands
of angry Filipinos marched in
downtown Manila yesterday in protest
of President Ferdinand Marcos’ elec-
tion victory. Police and military forces
are on a high alert in the tense capital.
Intelligence reports warn there could
be violence. Opposition leader Corazon
Aquino laid down the guidelines she
wants her supporters to follow in pro-
testing President Marcos’ election vic-
tory. She told a huge crowd of an
estimated one million people that she
wants non—violent opposition against a
government she said no longer has the
support of the people.

In an attempt to counter U.S. allega-
tions that the vote was fraudulent,
President Marcos has been accused of
trying‘ to appease the U.S. by announc-
ing the resignation of his military chief

French planes
fighting in Chad

PARIS — French defense officials said
French jets bombed a Libyan-built
airstrip in an area of northern Chad
controlled by rebels. The French
Defense Ministry in Paris said the
president of the African nation asked
for help against the Libyan backed
rebels. The airstrip was bombed early
yesterday but there were no reports on

casualties or damage. It was the first
- direct involvement of French troops in

the conﬂict since France withdrew its
troops from Chad in 1984.

Cruiser sinks

New Zealand — A Soviet cruise ship
with 740 people aboard sank during a
rainstorm off the New Zealand coast.
Officials believe all passengers made

it safely off the ship in lifeboats, but

16 passengers remain unaccounted for.

No deaths or injuries are reported. The

ship was going through the

Marlborough Sound when it hit rocks

at Cape Jackson on the northern tip of
New Zealand’s South Island, ripping

a gash in the vessel and ﬂooding the.
engine room. Most of the passengers

were Australians.

Iraq counters
Iranian gains

WASHINGTON — Iraq said it has
launched a three-pronged counterattack
to dislodge Iranian forces from Iraqi
territory, while Iran said it is “con-
solidating” its position inside southern
Iraq. The latest Iranian offensive has
resulted in the occupation of a small,
marshy wedge of Iraq’s southern ter-
ritory and the capture of a small island.
American officials and military
analysts think, however, that the pre-
sent offensi-ve is merely a feint attack
preparatory to launching a major
offensive.

The offensive has been timed with
the annual rainy season to offset Iran’s
lack of mobility. Iran apparently hoped
to bog down Iraq’s tank forces in the
marshy ground‘. The latest Iranian

thrust was an attempt to cut the
highway between Baghdad and Basra
but was turned back with heavy losses.
Iraqi warplans were able to enter bat-
tle on Sunday after the weather cleared
and carried out 170 sorties from dawn
to noon against the Iranian forces that
had crossed the Shatt al Arab water-
way. Iraq claims to have shot down two
Iranian F-4 fighter-bombers.while Iran
claims to have killed more than 2,000
Iraqi soldiers. _

The Ayatollah Khomeini has said
that he believes one more offensive will
finish the Iraqis and put an end to the
six—year war. The fighting began in
September 1980 over a border dispute.

South Africans
for equal access

South Africa —. A poll by one of
South Africa’s top newspapers (Rap-
part) shows whites are less committed
to that nation’s policy of racial separa-
tion than they were 10 years ago. Poll-
sters questioned about 200 whites last
December and more than 70 percent in-
dicated they were in favor of
desegregating theaters, moviehouses
and churches. Sixty-eight percent said
they could accept working under a boss
who was black.

proposal to convert the existing federal

Futrell. is nothing more than a ruse to
divert tax dollars from underfunded
public schools to pay for private

freezing spending for Chapter 1 at $3.2
billion for fiscal -1987.

In higher education. some $1.4 bil-
lion less in college student financial
assistance would be available ifthe ad-

cation. There are currently about 5.7
million college students receiving
grants of loans.

Cuts in higher education programs
would eliminate millions of dollars for
poor as well as middle—income students
and shut the door for most students
from low—income families to attend the
college of their choice. The cutback
proposed for the special allowance to
college loan lenders threatens the col-
lapse of the entire Guaranteed Student
Loan program. the largest of the stu-
dent aid programs. which not aids more
than three million students.

More than 800,000 of the nearly
three million students receiving Pell
Grants — 290.000 this fall alone -
would lose their eligibility for aid ifthe
administration proposals are approved

by Congress. And special remedial
programs for nearly 500.000 disadvan— .
taged students would be cut in half.

Vocational education fares equally
badly. The combination of the March
1 Gramm—Rudman—Hollings cut and the
administration's budget proposal would
slash vocational education programs by
over 50 percent. Of the $849 million
for vocational education Congress ap-

propriated in ﬁscal 1986.-$446 million - '

would be lost. .

In addition to education, the Reagan
administration has targeted billions

more dollars for cuts in domestic pro-‘ '

grams that affect the poor. Among
those programs: child nutrition. Job
Corps training'centers. summer youth
employment. Medicaid and federal
housing subsidies.

Organization brings
‘ ‘generations together”

By John Zaphyr
Assistant News Editor

State Public Welfare Secretary
Walter W. Cohen praised a growing
project statewide which. by bringing
"Generations Together," has had a
positive impact on the development and

learning of young children and on the.

quality of life of older people.
Cohen boosted a Generations

Together program in Pittsburgh last

Thursday during a visit to the Point

' - Park Children’s school at Point Park

College. During the visit, he observed
a training project for senior volunteers
working with preschool children.
Cohen announced that the Com-
monwealth will provide a $12,000
grant to Pitt’s Center for Social and Ur-
ban Research to further develop

Generations Together programs. The
state's total funding assistance from the
project at Pitt now totals $17,000. The
Research Department has participated
in Generations Together since 1978
when Pitt began the initiative.
“Generations Together creates what
its name implies, an intergenerational
program that fosters feelings of ac-
complishments and special caring be-
tween children and elderly persons,”
said Cohen. “We are able to tap the
energy and resources that belong to our
older and younger populations. Not on-
ly do the participants beneﬁt but also
the entire community. 1
“Again. Pittsburgh and Penn-
sylvania is a leader in the nation in an
innovative human service initiative,”
said Cohen. “This year’s grant will

AIDS: A Margin of

Safety

The general alarm elicited by the AIDS
epidemic has been sparked more by that which
remains unknown about the disease than that
which has been conclusively proven. Yet a re-
cent study conducted by Gerald Friedland of
New York’s Monteﬁore Medical Center should
do much to dispel some popular myths by
disclaiming the notion that the AIDS virus can

  be contracted through casual contact.

The study surveyed 101 people who live in
the same household as an AIDS victim (ex-
cluding, of course, the sexual partners of the
victims and others to be in high risk categories).
Not one of those in the survey, who routinely

shares bathrooms and kitchens and commonly

exchanges such affectionate familiarities as
kisses and hugs with those afﬂicted by the

AIDS virus, showed any signs of being infected
themselves .- This‘, then, would suggest that there

” is little‘. reason to fear that the population at large

is endangered by allowing AIDS victims to con-
tinue moving freely about.

Given the findings of this study, there can be
no justification for continuing to keep AIDS vic-
tims out of jobs, refusing them housing or keep-

. ing children so afﬂicted out of schools. Exclu-
ﬁsionary policies can no longer be advanced out
-of concern for safety.

Caution is often advisable in the face of the

t unknown. And, while there is still much to be

learned about AIDS, there is now evidence
aplenty that one can live and work with an AIDS
victim without danger of transmittal. One need

‘-no longer fear to show compassion and

understanding.

Arms Control   

This is a response to Tim van
Gelder’s article “U.S. -Nuclear Testing
And The Soviet Moratorium” pub-
lished in The Pitt News on Feb. 7,
1986. ,

Your analysis of the global political
situation leaves much to be desired and
ignores many factors which are crucial
to fully understanding present efforts
at arms control and its sincerity. Also
your opinions express a one-sided bias
which would have the Soviet Politburo
wearing ear-to-ear grins. The Soviets
would be quite pleased in knowing that
their propaganda tactics have shaped
and formed your malleable mind. Since
you have neglected the other side of the
argument I feel that it is my duty to in-

First of all, the Soviet Union would
not have agreed to halt .its nuclear
testing unless it was ahead of the United
States. Before announcing this
moratorium the Soviets had just com-

A pleted an extensive series of nuclear

tests. The United States also was plan-
ning a number of similar tests but they
have not yet been carried out. This was
the only reason that such an announce-
ment was made by- the Soviets. It is a
propaganda move which makes the
Soviet Union look like the peacemakers
while they are actually plotting to get
ahead. They receive support from the‘
uninformed who can’t fathom why the
United States would not agree to such
an agreement.

Secondly, why is the Soviet mora-
torium viewed as a “crucial opportuni-
ty?” Perhaps soviet rhetoric again?
Probably, for there have been a number
of efforts at arms control in the past.
SALT I and II were negotiated in order
to attempt to control the number of
nuclear arms and the development of
new systems. However, such peaceful
agreements have been violated by our
counterpart. Also the START talks
were initiated by the United States,
which included the “ZERO OP-
TION.“ which called for no U.S. or
Soviet missiles in Europe. The Soviets
refused and walked away from negotia-
tions. Based on this information, one
should immediately question the
sincerity of the Soviets “peaceful” in-
tentions and realize that they are in-
terested only in gaining the upper hand.

The people that you perceive as
"hawks" are only well—informed in-
dividuals who understand Soviet am-
bitions. They oppose foreign policy
moves which would make us vulnera-
ble. This does not mean that they don‘t
want peace. it only means that they

i don_:“_t wish tofrepeat’ the “mistakes of

« .

Neville Chamberlain, who through ap-
peasement helped Hitler conquer
western Europe. Instead, these so-
called hawks realize the need to main-
tain parity-with the Soviets. This has
resulted in what you call “billions that
are annually wasted on the production
of weapons of mass destruction.”
My question to you is this: How has
this money been wasted? After all, we
pay for our defense in the hope that we
will not have to use it. Spending on
nuclear arms maintains nuclear parity
between the superpowers and deters a
nuclear exchange. As long as this
spending has prevented a nuclear war
has it really been wasted? Granted, we
would all like to reduce spending
money on arms, but this must be done
in an intelligent manner which is
agreeable to both sides. Until we can
reach such an agreement though, is it
such a waste to spend money on
weapons which have kept the peace?
My suggestion to you and the rest of
the ‘liberal, democratic, idealistic
foreign policy writers at The Pitt News
is to keep up with current events in in-
ternational affairs before you blindly
write about them.

Thrift Shop Elitism

To Mary Taylor, in response to your
reply: -

I never write replies, but I couldn‘t
resist this one. First, let me say that
“Mr.” Eisenstat, among others, was
probably at the Upstage Lounge that
night you were at the Junior Prom, so
there’s no need for you to invite him
back. (Whose license got you in?)
Some of those others would like to
dance to the only good music in town
without having to put up with a crop
of thrift-shop prima donnas — with

people who must begin every sentence —

with “we" (“We at the Upstage  We

-are nobody’s entertainment  We are ' '

just as indifferent  ”); people who
must assert their self-imposed elitism
at every turn, including in a letters

' column.

As for conversation, talking to some-
one at the Upstage on a Monday is like
screaming in a mausoleum, both in the
response and in the effort it takes to get

someone to listen. And I doubt you’re "

very worried about being intellectual,
since one point seems to pass you by:
Adam's
ments" are one ofthe few attempts in
years to bring some kind of literary, ex_—
perimental” style" back to The Pitt

“rude and tasteless com-j

News.” But I guess you wouldn‘t have _

noticed that: he insultedyour ,own,_,:—

1.

Letters to the Editor——=

“private Idaho.” Then again, you
probably wouldn’t have noticed
anyway. Read some satire and the
whole thing will fall magically into
place for you. Maybe.

So much for intellectualism, Mary.
Stuff that in your “we” and dance 
er  have a stimulating conversation
with it.

Lack of Respect

Re: Adam Eisenstat’s recent
“Ramblings From The Depths,” con-
cerning the American people’s mour-
ning of the space shuttle Challenger
crew. Grow up!

So you “tasted death.” You stared
it straight in the face by attending one
autopsy, at which you arrived late.
Very ﬁtting for someone with the at-
titude toward death of a 6-year-old,
don’t you think? You reduced a think-
ing, loving human being, although
deceased, into a pile of garbage pre-
sent only for your amusement. You
cheapened the event: it wasn’t cheap
when you arrived.

Then you have the nerve to call us
“sanctimonious” for showing our
respect for seven American heroes,
pioneers who gave their lives to make
yours a little better. It may be a “no-
no” to cry over the dead in some
societies, but in those same societies it
also is abhorrent to taste their flesh or
to make fun of their once living bodies.
Yes, we “are” sorry! Not only for the
Challenger crew and their families, but
for you, too!

Someone give Jim Crary. a set of hun-
dred pound love beads so he can't sit up
to write his soft—headed, anachronistic
fodder. I mean. how‘s this for penetrating
social bambast. I mean criticism — En-
nui, boredom-and complacency are the
masks of fear in our culture, just as pride.
arrogance and anger are the masks of
criminality (Showcase, Feb. 7). Jeez.

Talk about refuse of an era.
' Thank God the ’60s are over. There’s

nothing like an atmosphere thick with
delusion and simplistic sloganeering to
choke substantial discourse and severe-
ly alienate the non-idealistic among us.
Ballpoint radicals go home. (Okay, okay,

don’t push so hard.) _ _
The key to sanity and productivity in

a world pervaded by chaos, social and
cultural desolation and all—around
ugliness is to affirm all these things and
appropriate those parts of the malaise
called reality which can beintegrated into
an original style. Whether you are a

capitalist, like Malcolm ,McLaren ("Cash

the world is a veritable cornucopia of in-
spiration and resources. In my case. for
instance. it gives me something to write
and sing about and hey, I loves to be read
and heard. -
Speaking of soft-headed fodder,
Suzette Charles, who was recently ex-

hibited at Pitt by the whitebread-bland— .

is an accredited nobody who rode on the
back of the Miss America overseers'
puritanism when they ousted the real win-
ner, Yanessa Williams, for exercising her
god-given right to bare her breasts in
public. 'Is Suzette Charles the sort of
"entertainment” the student body
demands, or is itjust what's shoved down
its collective throat by a shadowy con-
gress of string—pu|lers commited to keep-
ing Pittsburgh safe, wholesome and com-
placent? Look, there's plenty of time for

complacency after school. in the real
world, where inexorable routine and
responsibility keeps psyches tidy and
energy zapped. The conventional ‘mind
has no conception of how liberating and
stimulating the grotesque. excruciating-
ly alien and deliciously violent can be.

slugged it out among the paparazzi with
Sean and Madonna, cruised the interstate
with the Boss. roped steers with Sam and

Jessica, fellated ICBMs with Cap and

Children: Relieving Our Over—blown Anxieties

NBC hustled a child psychologist on
to the air. He said talk to the kids. USA
Today followed with a story headlined,
“Explaining disaster to kids.” It in-
cluded a survey that showed that 69
percent of us had talked with our kids.
772:: New York Times poll reported that
75 percent of us had talked to our kids
and three-fifths of the kids had been
talked to by their schools. No wonder
the Japanese are beating the pants off
of us. Our kids can’t get any work
done. _

Almost immediatelyafter the space
shuttle Challenger blew up, national
concern focused onchildren. What to
do? They hadseen it all. And if they
had not seen itlive, they had seen it
on. one of the incessant tape repeats of
the explosion; it was funeral music for

a keen eye out for the traumatic ex-
perience. The experts shouted the
alarm. Trauma was spotted advancing

A visitor from an earlier generation
would wonder why all the anxiety.
Death was once commonplace and the
kids who survived, survived. You on-

in any family to come across ancestors
who had a dozen children, of whom on-
ly maybe three reached adulthood.
Women routinely died in childbirth.

Famine struck. Storms hit. Men were
killed in war or at dangerous jobs and
influenza, when it came, emptied
cities. Death was then very much a part
of life. Still, there was poetry and
music and young men brought ﬂowers
to young women.

Why then the anxiety now? Why the
sudden concern that today’s children
will be scarred by the death of people
they don’t even know? Certainly, some
of the anxiety was purely personal and
hadlnothing to do with children. Adults
are the ones who are closer to death "-
who live with it and who wondered
what it felt like in that shuttle: Did it
hurt? Did they know? Was the entire,
doomed shuttle voyage just life in fast
forward — from something to nothing
in a ﬂash? We all thought of these
things.

But to be a parent is to know more
than anxiety. It is to know guilt. The.

_ Moorehead also said that the mayor
knows what the police are doing but that
he has chosen to take a neutral stand. “He
knows how powerful the police are and
by not doing anything he is giving the
okay to the racist groups.”

The entire march took up the chant as
one voice and the sound was overwhelm-
ing, yet the.police seemed to have no
reaction. It appeared ironic that the police
were clearing the streets for a march that
was, in part, a protest of them. Yet the ‘
entire time they were very businesslike
in mannerand did not intermingle with
the crowd. In fact, two officers who were

with their heads resting back and stared

“Racism is certainly existent in Hart-
ford, Connecticut,” said Cris Hollings,
a resident of Hartford. “The neighbor-
hoods where I live are divided on black
and white racial lines.”

Tension between blacks and whites
may decrease when they work together
for a common cause, such as students
fighting for . divestment, Hollings

“The anti—apartheid protests have -

helped to bind together blacks and
whites,” said Val Opielski, ajunior at

sion of boredom.
When questioned as to how they felt
about the march, the officers on duty said
that they were not permitted to give any
comments. A chief ofﬁcer from Civil Af-
fairs who refused to give his name said,
"Talk to the people about the march;
they’re the ones who are holding it.”
Moorehead was very pleased with the
turnout of people. There were represen-
tatives of a variety of organizations from"
all over the country. There were over 65
people present from the All People's
Congress in New York. This organi-za-
tion has affiliations all over the country
and it played an important role in mak-
inglthe march possible.

Also present was the Boston Public
Housing Tenants United organization.
President Barbara Mallon said that they

represented over 60,000 public housing
tenants. ~

“There are all races living together in
the poorer areas of Boston, ” said Mallon.
“We have to unite to get government of-
ficials to give us better housing."

A forceful organization present was the
Bill 649 Coalition group from
Philadelphia. The bill is currently going
through City Council and if passed, goals
would be set for the hiring of minorities
and women, particularly in city construc-
tion projects. This is important because
construction jobs constitute a large
percentage of the local workforce.

“We are uniting against all forms of
racism,” said Moorehead. “We want to
send bigots and those who oppress into
hiding so that they will not raise their ugly
heads again.”

is the first time 1’ve seen any kind of
activity at all.”

‘Students at Penn recently staged a
20-day sit-in at a campus building in
protest of university policy toward
South Africa, and students also took
over the president’s office. Opielski
said Penn’s board of trustees have
refused to respond.

“They’ve tried their best not to re-
spond,” she said. “They’re just avoid-
ing the issue.”

A number of protesters at the march
were from Brandeis University, and
they described their efforts to get their
university to divest. Students at
Brandeis have built a shantytown on-
campus similar to the housing in South
African black homelands.

“The shantytown is made out of gar-
bage from my attic, spare wood, card-
board, old rugs, and branches,” said
Brandice sophomore Anna Demetrak—
opoulos.

She said the shanty town was built
to bring the issue of divestment in view
to every student.

Stephen Gagliardone, a senior at the
University of Vermont, said that
students there are still fighting against
apartheid even though their school has
completely divested.

“Divestment-isn’t an end — it’s a
means,” said Gagliardone, a member
of Vermont’s student organization, the
Apartheid Negation Congress.
“Divestment raised the consciousness
of the American people.”

New helicopter helps save lives

By Michelle Zollner
Staff Writer L

A 45-minute ambulance ride may
have cost a severely ill three—year—old
his life. However. he survived —
thanks to an air transport program
used by eleven area hospitals.

Eric Kunkel complained of a sore
elbow and knee on Saturday, April 27,
1985. “He couldn‘t stay awake and he
had a fever.” Eric’s mother said.
“During his bath. I noticed spots on
his body and thought he was getting
chicken pox.”

At 4 a.m. on Sunday, April 28,
Eric’s parents were awakened by the
cries of their son as he experienced a

was diagnosed as having the contagious

“He had to be rushed to Children's
Hospital quickly, the doctors told us."

Eric was then taken to a large park-
ing lot and placed aboard a Specialized
Treatment and Transport [STAT]
helicopter. .

“It was very emotional and upsetting
because he had just turned three, and
he had never been off by himself,"
Mrs. Kunkel said. “We knew how bad
it was and we couldn’t lose our son.”
She added that “a security guard was
with us and he was even in tears.”

The helicopter transport took ap-
proximately eight minutes for the 20
mile distance. “Time—wise, it saved
Eric’s life, because we were told our
son only had 1-2 to 16 hours to live.”

The helicopter, nicknamed Angel I,
which transported Eric is not only fast

but clinically prepared. “The helicop- V

ter is an Intensive Care Unit in the air, ”
said David Franc, director of opera-
tions of the Office of Transport and
STAT program.

The helicopter has the capability to
handle such crises as trauma, cardiac
and neo—natal patients and two-patient
transport. _It always carries a medical
team “consisting of a flight nurse or
paramedic and either a resident of the
Center for Emergency Medicine or a
faculty physician,” said Franc.

The STAT program, a division of the
Center for Emergency Medicine of
Western Pennsylvania, is “an in-

tegrated ground and air system,” said
Franc. The center, an association of l 1
area hospitals, also has a Lear iet
[Angel 11] and a Critical Care Land
Transport [Angel III].

“We receive 75 to 90 requests a
month for transport,” said Franc. The
craft responds to as many calls as possi-
ble. However. if the helicopter is on
call or the weather is bad (which hap-
pens in 10 percent ofthe calls in Pitts-
burgh). an alternate STAT transport is
dispatched. The alternate vehicle dis~
patched would be staffed by the special-
ty medical crew which would normal-
ly be staffing the helicopter.

The land transport would respond to
the majority of the calls the helicopter
was unavailable for. “It provides acute
patient transport by land,” Franc said.
“Needless to say, it’s not as fast.”

The Lear jet is used for 1ong—distance
ﬂights. For instance, ajet was recent-
ly dispatched to quickly transport the
human heart of an accident victim from
Texas to Arizona resident Bernadette
Chayrez, a 40-year-old woman who
was being kept alive by the Jarvik-7
mechanical heart.

Mrs. Kunkel can testify to the value
of the program. “The helicopter saved
Eric Kunkel’s life,” she said. “Today,
you could not realize that he was so
severely ill.”

The Pitt News, February 17, 1986 '

Pirate ticket sales come to Pitt

'i_ By Teresa Varley

For The Pitt News

Sit back, take a minute and relax.
Think about summer: The warm sun
baking your skin, cool lemonade
splashing over ice cubes and the crack
of a bat as it makes Contact with a
baseball.

While it might be a little early to start
planning on getting a tan, it is certain-
ly not too early to get in gear for
baseball season. As a matter of fact,
now is the time to make your plans to
attend Pittsburgh Pirates baseball
games.

Representatives from the Pirates
organization will be at Pitt Tuesday,
Feb. 18, to participate in “The Great
Pirate Ticket Sale. ” Pitt will be one of
the 40 planned locations where the
Pirates will offer fans numerous ticket
options.

According to Steve Greenberg, Pi-
rates director of marketing, the tickets
will be sold in either Forbes Quad-
rangle or the Student Union from 8:30
am. to 7 p.m. Bill Hillgrove from
WTAE—TV will be on hand from 1 1:30
a.m. to help with the effort as will Jim
Winn, a pitcher for the Pirates.

Tickets also will be sold at the Orig-
inal, located on Forbes Ave. in Oak-
land. You can buy your tickets there
from 9 a.m. until 10 p.m. _Perry Mar-
shall of KDKA—Radio will join Winn
there in making a guest appearance.

- “We have not set a goal on how
many tickets we want to sell,” Green-
berg said. “We have never done any-
thing like this before. We just want to
sell as many tickets as we can.”

Right now, the Pirates have sold

Generations

continued from page 3

allow these friendships to ﬂourish be-
tween youth and older citizens in Penn-
sylvania communities.”

Cohen said that 15,000 children and
youth and 1,000 older persons current-

“ ly are participating in Generations

Together programs statewide. Since the
project began, ongoing intergenera-
tional activities have involved 40,000
children and youth between six weeks
and 22 years of age, and 2,000 persons
over 55 years of age.

Generations Together was created to
help ease the problems that exist be-
tween the younger and older genera-
tions. The problems of loss of role,
separations between the generations,
isolation of the elderly, limited family

support systems and competition for 7

funding are among the societal prob-
lems that may be alleviated by the
growing numbers of intergenerational
programs within the United States.

The Department’s funding enables
Pitt to train staff from child care centers
and senior citizens to develop activities
between children and senior citizens.
Project participants expect further
development during 1985-86 to include
continued support and follow-up train-
ing for those centers which have par-
ticipated in theipast; establish an ex-
change of information to share on
resources for activities between senior
citizen groups and children groups; and
expand the programs to other areas in
the state.

“Many worthwhile projects are be-
ing created to involve youth and older
people in meaningful exchanges,” said
Cohen. “For our society to continue
to grow and prosper, we need to sup-
port these relationships. The Genera-
tions Together Project has shown us
how to bring them together.

“Most of these children at Point Park
Children's School have parents who
work in downtown Pittsburgh,” said
Cohen. “So, in addition to helping
children and senior citizens, this pro-

ject also has the added benefit of ‘

assisting parents with piece of mind.
ultimately providing businesses with
more productive workers.”

275.000 tickets, without the help of a
major promotion like this. They would
like to reach a total of 600,000 tickets
sold in the preseason.

Some of the ticket options that will
be offered include the Flex Plan, which
has been their most popular one. This
entitles the fan to 1 1 ticket coupons for
the price of 10. Another option is the
Captain’s Plan in which fans can pur-
chase tickets for all of the 81 home
games at a $1 dollar discount per ticket
for some of the best seats in the
stadium. The Bucco Plan will provide
tickets to 42 games with a 50 cent dis-
count per ticket. And last but not least,
is the Weekender Plan which includes
27 games with two bonus games.

While it might have been tough to
sell tickets to Pittsburghers in the last
few years, things are looking up for
the Pirates.

The black and gold has a complete-
ly new look and it is one that should
appeal to the fans. The team is a young
one, with an average age of about 25.
The coaching staff is a new and fresh
one with Jim Leyland at the helm. The

front—office staff also has been
revamped with Malcolm Prine as the
Pirate president and Syd Thrift as
general manager.

The Pirates, who are not going to
have "a captain this year because they
want to lead by example and not by lip
service, fee] that the team’s youth will
be a help rather than a hinderance.

“We have a young staff,” Leyland
said at a Chamber of Commerce lunch-
eon held recently. “There are too many
people out there laughing at the Pitts-
burgh Pirates. We are going to do
something about that.”

Leyland, who has a one-year con-
tract with the Pirates, does have a tough
battle on his hands. But, it is one he
is willing to attack head—on.

“This is better than the toughest job
in the minor leagues,” Leyland said
jokingly. “I have to prove myself. I
want to be a part of Pittsburgh.

“I am renting right now,” said
Leyland, “but, if we win, I’m hoping
to get a long—term contract.” I

Music dept.

Beethoven
concert

By Jack Burkman
Staff Writer

Tomorow evening, in celebration of
its golden anniversary, ' Pitt’s music
department will feature a presentation
of Beethoven’s “Choral Fantasy.”

Ricardo Schultz, concert co-
ordinator, said" he feels the event is un-
questionably one of great magnitude.

“Involved are the University Choral
Society, the University Orchestra and
the Heinz Chapel Choir.” Schultz said.
“This is the first time the groups are
all coming together  we will have
about 100 voices as well as an orchestra
 bringing all 150 performers together
is quite an undertaking.”

Schultz notes, though, that this par-
ticular Beethoven piece is well-suited
for a.large group.

At the center of attention tomorrow
will be well-known concert pianist,
Leslie Amper. As Carolyn Anderson
of the music department pointed out,
“Amper is the ideal person for this par-
ticular situation.” ’

According to Schultz, “There will
also be two orchestral solos, including
a trumpet concerto and a Mozart Sym-
phony. The Mozart piece (No. 40 in
G Minor) was the theme song of the

Academy Award-winning film,
“Amadeus.”

Neither the choir or the orchestra is
comprised solely of music majors. In
fact, Schultz said he was fascinated by
the diversity of performers.

“It's quite a mixed group —— staff,
students and faculty. Many people are
involved. We have a physics professor,
undergraduate engineering students, an
English major, philosophy graduate
students, law students and others  I
think it’s really great to see an 18-year-
old engineering student playing the
violin.” I -

Perhaps more astonishing than the
wide variety of musicians is the overall
cost of the production. Because the
concert is being coordinated by the
music department, expenses are
relatively minimal, according to
Schuhz. '

“If the university were to do
something like this on the outside, it
would cost a mint  churches, for a
single production of this kind, often
have budgets of$10,000 to $15,000,”
said Schultz.

The music department notes that
general admission is $3, “but free to

anyone with a Pitt I.D.”

,Wrestlers fall

By Patrick Good
Staff Writer

For the second straight week,
another top ten wrestling power has
ﬂexed its muscles against the much
underrated Pitt wrestling team. The
ninth-ranked Bloomsburg Huskies
showed the strength of their line-up
winning seven of the ten matches en
route to a 30-12 victory over the
Panthers. ‘

The Panthers were again drained by
another road trip that took them some
five hours away from home. The host

of’this weekend’s trip didn’t exactly .

treat their guests very nice. Right from
the start, Pitt found themselves ﬁghting
for their lives in every match. The long
trip home was even longer for several

, dejected Panthers.

A set of twins, Ricky and Rocky
Bonomo, pounded Panther co—captains
John Hnath and Kyle Nellis, holding
the seniors to a combined fourpoints.
The brother combination combined to
score 34 points as they defeated Hnath
and Nellis handily, by scores of 14-2
and 17-2 respectively.

With the lopsided victories at 126
and 134 pounds coupled another vic-
tory at 1 18 pounds, the Huskies open-
ed up a 14-0 lead and never looked
back. Pitt did manage to get points
from several individuals.

Pat Santoro continued his winning
ways with a pin over Kent Lane to up
his season mark to 24-4.

The only other Panther winners were
Doug Haines at 158 pounds and Eric
Wertz. who followed Haines at 167

' pounds.

In the other seven matches, the
Bloomsburg team proved too much for
the 19th-ranked Panthers. The Huskies,
now 11-4 this season, sent the Panthers
back to the highway to return with their
second straight defeat in a week and left
an empty feeling in their hearts.

Eile Photo/TheiIi’itt News

“I wouldn’t say it was a total disap- .

97

pointment, said. coach Rande Stot-
tlemyer. “We had some guys that
wrestled well. Pat [Santoro] went out
and got a pin for us, and Doug [Haines]
is doing a great job for us. But, we
could have done a lot better.

“Johnny [Hnath] and Kyle [Nellis]
got hammered. Our two leaders took
a shellacking, and from there it was
really tough on the rest of the guys."

The biggest difference may be all the
traveling this Pitt team has had to make
in recent weeks. Pitt—hasn’t wrestled on
their own mat in nearly a month. The
trips away from home have certainly
taken their toll on the tired Panther
team. ‘Wrestling national powers like
Penn State and Bloomsburg on the
road, back to back, has not been any
fun.

“Traveling on the road has made a
difference,” said starting 118-pounder
Steve Kasza. “You could see the guys
were tired of being in the vans. It's
really been tough on us, and it’s show-
ed in our last couple of matches."

“Traveling has definitely had an ef-
fect on us,” added Stottlemyer. “I
hope it doesn’t effect the guys any
more. Hopefully, returning home can
work out for us.” '

The loss drops the worn-out Panthers
to 7-2-2 for the year. Losing to an
EWL opponent also sets the Panthers
back to fourth in the‘ league behind

The Pitt basketball team has been
playing games with my mind this
season.‘ .

The question I’ve been asking myself
is: Which is the real Pitt basketball
team? Is it the one which plays with
some of the best teams in the country
or the one which falters against the Big
East Conference’s weak sisters — Con-
necticut and Seton Hall?

Pitt has looked like a world beater
on occasion, yet other times, has
looked miserable in losses.

How can Pitt look so good against
a topnotch team like Georgetown and
then lose at home to Seton Hall (the Big
East Conference’s worst team for
years)? -

This was supposed to be the year Pi
cracked the Top 20 nationally. It is ob-
vious Pitt has the talent to finish near
the top in the conference.

Charles Smith and Curtis Aiken have
played consistent basketball throughout
the season for Pitt, establishing
themselves as two of the conference’s
best players.

But something has gone wrong along
the way to national exposure. Pitt has
only won five of its first 11 Big East
matchups. And the Panthers 14-8
overall record is not impressive when
one considers they racked up quite a

few non-conference wins over teams
that IUP could have whipped.

The Panthers will get one last chance

to show people what they are capable
of. That last chance is tonight when the
Big East Conference’s best team,
Syracuse, comes to town. . 1

It is a tough task, but Pitt must beat
Syracuse tonight. In fact, if Pitt has any

Randy Miller

aspirations of receiving a NCAA berth,
they must defeat the Orangemen.

Right now, Pitt does not deserve a
NCAA seed. They have been too in-
consistent. Last week the team looked
like a world beater against Villanova,
but then they lost at Connecticut.

Fortunately, Pitt has ﬁve games left.
If the Panthers finishqwith a flourish,
winning four of those games, they
would undoubtedly go to the N CAAS.
But they must start somewhere, tonight
is their chance.

In fact, tonight is do or die for Pitt.
The Panthers, by beating a team with
Syracuse’s credentials, could gain
enough confidence so they could go
through the rest of the season unbeaten
with the possible exception of the ﬁnal

regular season game at Georgetown. It
is not impossible, not even improbable.

It will not be easy since Syracuse has
some of the finest players in the coun-
try. However, Pitt did play well against
Syracuse earlier in the season in their
10-point loss at the Carrier Dome.

The Syracuse offense is lead by point
guard Pearl Washington. Washington
has been playing some of his best
basketball the past few weeks, and he
may finally be fulfilling-some of his
unlimited potential. Small forward

Rafeal Addison is a weapon Pitt must ,-

contend with. Addison, who was
chosen as the Big East’s pre-season
Player of the Year, has been plagued
by injuries lately; and his status is
unknown. ” .

Tonight’s matchup will be a
character test for the Panthers. Since
the game will be televised on ESPN,
Pitt will get a chance to show the coun-
try they are indeed worthy of a national
ranking despite their inconsistent play.

 

The road to the N CAAs for Pitt must , I

start somewhere. It must start tonight.

Game Notes: The Pitt athletic
department lifted the local blackout,

so the game can be seen locally on ‘-

ESPN.

short at Bloomsburg

Bloomsburg. Pitt is 2-2-1 in EWL com-
petition, while Bloomsburg moves to
3-2, just ahead of the Panthers. Mean-
while, sitting atop the league standings
are the third- and fourth-ranked teams
in the nation, Clarion and Penn State,
who-tied earlier in the season.

The Panthers now must regroup

‘from the two consecutive losses to face

their ﬁnal EWL opponent, Clarion, this
Wednesday evening at Shaler High
School. The match will mark the third
straight top ten team they must face,
and it will be the sixth team Pitt will

wrestle that’s been in the top twenty at
some point this season.‘ The match will
be another tough test for the determin-
ed Panthers as Clarion will bring a
16-0-1 record into the match.

Stottlemyer is aware of what lies
ahead for his Panthers, but the coach
remains optimistic about the team_’s
situation. The coach knows that it
won’t take much for his kids to be
ready against another goliath wrestling
power.

“[Clarion’s] not ranked third for

nothing,” said Stottlemyer. “We’re the V

Panther wrestler ke Jongel as the grip on the opposition.

only one that stands between them and
an undefeated season. Our guys know
that, and they’ll be up for the test. It
shouldn’t take much for them to get up
for a team of Clarion’s caliber.”

Klafter wins four events

‘ The ‘Pitt’ News; February I7, I986”

Gymnasts beat elements, EMU

By Julia Stitely
Staff Writer

The winning was both easy and dif-
ﬁcult for the Panther gymnasts Friday.
They beat host Eastern Michigan
University by the huge margin of
254.45 to 208.50, but poor meet con-
ditions did not help the Panther cause.

A mixup in hotel reservations and
slow traveling due to the weather got

the team to Eastern Michigan in time .

for warmups but not in time for any
pre-meet rest. The facilities and equip-
ment were not the best either. The
lighting was poor and the equipment
not up to the standard to which the Pan-
thers are accustomed.

“Their rings, for instance, are not
hung from a ring apparatus. They’re
hung from the ceiling,” Pitt head coach
Frank D’Amico said. “Imagine the
rings being hung from the ceiling sup-
ports at Trees Hall. There’s less give
and more stress on the shoulders.”

Injuries and illness also hurt the Pan-

thers. “We’re hurting to fill the lineup

because of the injury to Jim Gemelas,”
D’Amico said. All-arounder Jorge San-
chez competed while suffering from the
flu, after missing nearly a week of
practice. “The highlight of the meet
was Jorge Sanchez,” D’Amico said.
“We took each event one at a time but
he hit all the events. I was very sur-
prised and pleased. He rose to the oc-

casion. He did all his full routines.” _

Sanchez won vault with a 9.4, tied

for. second on ﬂoor exercise with a 9.1 I

and had a season best of 8.9 on parallel
bars. _ ,

Vaulting and ﬂoor exercise were the
Panthers’ strongest events. They scored
a season high of 45.7 on vault.
D’Amico was more enthusiastic about
ﬂoor exercise, however. “I think our
ﬂoor exerciseroutines are better than
anybody’s. No one’s been able to beat

  
   

us yet.”

High bar is a different story. “We‘re
desperately struggling,” D’Amico
said. “It used to be our blitzing event.
I’m shocked at our scores but I can’t
get our guys to progress any faster."

Pitt scored 38 points on high bar Fri-
day, having to count a 5.6, 6.0, and 6.1
in the total. Teams of Pitt’s caliber
usually score over 40 points as Pitt is
doing on every other event. The injury
to Gemelas has especially hurt on this
event.

“I‘m going to put pressure on a cou-
ple of guys to really work on high bar.

Mike Mealie shows his “ﬂair” on the pommel hor _ .

It's not like they’re not doing anything.
They're trying  I can’t expect the
high bar team to get 9.5’s."

The Panthers’ next meet is Saturday
against Slippery - Rock at home.
D’Amico is looking beyond that
however. “My goal is for two weeks
away. We go to Slippery Rock for the
Great Lakes Championships. I want-to
win that tournament. I want to win -it
bad. Right now, we’re one of the top
favorites but I don’t think they realize
we’re hurting.”

The Panthers are now 7-2 for the
season.

The Reds and the Blue Jays are the
teams of the present. They,‘ along with
the Pirates, are the teams with the most
hustle. Look for an October Reds—Jays
match-up that will go seven games.

    
 

  

People who say that Pete Rose can’t
produce anymore must not have seen
him last season. Either that, or they just
don’t know anything about baseball.
With a month left in the season, Pete
was third in the National League in on-
base percentage! But he proved himself
human by ﬁnally letting the pressure
of the Cobb record get to him, and he
suffered a letdown after breaking the
record. Look for Pete to hit .302 this
season and fall short of 4400 lifetime
hits.

By John Enright
Staff Writer

It has been a tough year for the Pitt
Lady Panthers basketball team. Playing
with relatively few experienced players.
Pitt has struggled through the rugged Big
East conference with a 4-10 league record
to date.

One of the bright spots on this year’s
team has been senior point guard Kim
Tirik. Tirik, a native of nearby Am-
bridge. Pa, established herself as one of

the state‘s top players her senior year at
Ambridge. Tirik garnered first team All-
State honors that year, and she is current-
ly Beaver County’s all—time women‘s
basketball leading scorer with l,756
points. Her achievements at Pitt have not
equaled her high school honors, but she
has established herself as one of the all-
time great lady Panther players.

Tirik is obviously pleased with her suc-
cess at Pitt. “I’ve enjoyed my four years
here at Pitt. 1 think all four years I’ve ac—,
complished some of the things I wanted

to," said Tirik. "I would have liked to
accomplish a lot more. but sometimes it
doesn't work the way you want it to. But.
overall I‘ve been pleased with my career
here.”

And why shouldn't she be pleased?
Currently, Tirik is the Lady Panthers‘
seventh all—time leading scorer with 823
points. She holds the Big East Freshman
record for assists in'a game with 12 in
a 1984 contest against Connecticut. Also,
Tirik is tied with former Lady Panther
great Debbie Lewis for the Pitt record for
assists in a game (16 vs. West Virginia)
and in_a season (186 in 1983-84).

Passing the ball is one of Tirik‘s main
strengths according to her head coach
Kirk Bruce. “She is a thread—in—the—
needle type of passer. She gets the ball
to the people at a point where they can
score and that tells you what kind of
passer she is.”

Bruce is also impressed with Tirik’s at-
titude. “Kim is the type of player that if
she sets her mind to do something then
she can do it,” said Bruce. “There is no
question that that’s the case. She has that
type of confidence in her ability.”

Tirik, being the competitor she is,

Third at Milrose

never seems to be satisﬁed with her per-
formance. "I could be playing a lot bet-
ter. At times I‘ve looked good, but at
times I‘ve looked awful. I have to be
more consistent if the team is going to
have any kind of success," commented
Tirik.

Tirik has started at Pitt since her
freshman season. In those days, Tirik
didn‘t need to score because Lady Pan-
thers had other prolific scorers, such as
Jennifer Bruce, Pam Miklasevich, Ellen
Gilhooley and Lisa Fubio.

But all those players are gone now, and
Bruce knew that Tirik’s scoring produc-
tion would have to improve this season.
And it has. Tirik is averaging slightly
more than 13 points a game for Pitt this
season. _

“This year she is with a lot of the
younger players. In that respect, her
game has changed. She has to do a lot
more scoring,” said Bruce. “She
understands that, so she is taking double
the amount of shots that she took over the
past years.” _

According to Bruce, the pressure to
score has improved Tirik’s game.
“Kim’s a long range shooter, but in a lot

McRae impressive

Pitt sophomore Lee McRae took
another step towards establishing
himself as one of the top sprinters in
the world this weekend. McRae fin-
ished third in the 60-yard dash in the
prestigious Millrose Games at Madison
Square Garden in New York City.

“We knew Lee belonged with the
top sprinters in the world,” head coach
John Vasvary said, “and he proved it.”

McRae recorded his impressive
finish despite running against proven
sprinters. He defeated Olympians

Harvey Glance and Calvin Smith in a A

preliminary heat and faced several
more Olympians in the final.

His next challenge will be this
weekend at the Big East Champion-
ships at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse,
N.Y. Last year, he received the Big
East Most Outstanding Performance
Indoors. ’

McRae, a native of Pembroke, N.C.,
has recorded the second fastest
55-meter/60-yard dash time this year.

T irik handles pressure in senior year

of her play this year. she‘s going inside
quite a bit. driving and things of that
nature. This had added another dimen-
sion to her offensive game." commented
Bruce.

The Lady Panthers are headed for a
losing record this season. That is
something new for Tirik, who played on
winning teams her first three years at Pitt,
Does she’ view this season as a
disappointment‘?

"If you look at our win—loss record you
would have to say ‘yes,’ but we do have
a lot of young players that are inex-
perienced,” added Tirik.

The Lady Panthers conclude the season
with three consecutive home games
before traveling to Boston for the Big
East Championship. Tirik is confident the
Lady Panthers can turn it around.

“I think we can. There have been so
many games this year where we’ve been
in it right down until the end, ” said
Tirik. “In the Big East Tournament, I
think anybody can beat anybody. I don’t
think there’s really any powerhouse this
year in the Big East.”

Tirik, a co—captain and four—year starter
and letter winner, will be sorely missed
by the Lady Panthers hoop team after her
April graduation. Although she will no
longer compete as a player, Tirik doesn't
intend to abandon basketball altogether.

“Someday I would like to get into
coaching. I don’t know what level, high
school or college, but I‘ll probably be do-
ing that in the future.”

Connecticut rules
Kelley ineligible

STORRS, Conn. (UPI) — Earl
Kelley, a senior guard and the leading
scorer for Connecticut, was declared
academically ineligible to play for the
rest of the season.

Kelley. who played in 94 games and
started 80 for the Huskies, scored

1,592 career points for a 16.9 average. (
He had been the Huskies’ leadingr

scorer each of his four varsity seasons.
This season, Kelley was leading
Connecticut in scoring (19.6 ppg),
assists, minutes, steals and free throw
percentage. He is the second leading
scorer in the Big East Conference.
The fifth leading scorer in UConn
history, Kelley led the Huskies to a
77-73 victory over Pitt last Tuesday,
scoring 30 points and dishing out nine
assists. UConn visits Pitt next Monday
night for their final Big East Con-
ference clash of the regular season.
