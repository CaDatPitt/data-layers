The Student Government Board
wants student environmental‘
groups to have the ability to come
together under one, environmen-
tally sustainable roof. '

The Board voted to advocate
the establishment of an Ofﬁce of
Sustainability, which would fall a
under Student Affairs, to the Uni-
versity. The Environmental Com-
mittee, the Green Fund Advisory
Board and SGB have been pushing
the office since 2012, and the idea

- was reintroduced by Board mem-

ber Sarah Winston last Tuesday.
The decision was supported
unanimously by the ‘Board, includ-
ing Board member Thomas Jabro,
who said that it was a mistake that
he was not originally listed as a co-
sponsor on the copy of the reso-
lution last week. He said that the
omission of his name was a typo.

graduated last spring and plarmed to
start classes at Pitt’s School of Law
this year. Between 100 and 150 peo-
ple, almost all students, attended
the service, which was held in Heinz
Memorial Chapel from 6 to 7p.m.
Both Morgan and Vega passed
away over the summer. Vega, who
was 22, passed away after a rafting

accident early lastjuly in Ohiopyle ‘

State Park. Morgan, who would have
turned 21 onjuly 14, was interning
in Spain atthe time she passed away
earlier that same month.

Taylor Staiger, a friend of Vega
who graduated from Pitt last year
and now works in Pitt’s Office of
the Provost, said she worked with
Dean of Students Kathy Humphrey
and Linda Williams-Moore, direc-
tor of the Office of Cross—Cultural
and Leadership Development, to
organize the service.

parents, Rob and Mary, made the
four—hour drive to Pittsburgh for

Staiger said that Vega planned
to become an immigration attor-
ney. She also said that, through the

Brent Hill, a friend of Vega who gradu-
ated last year, told the congregation that Vega
worked ﬁill-time last summer, but when he
took breaks at work, he would help Hill ap-
ply to graduate programs by looking at Hill’s
application essays.

“[Vega was] a perfect model of what it i

means to be truly selﬂess,” Hill said.‘
Morgan, whose family lives inwashington,
D.C.,.was majoring in political science and
economics. Since age 10, she’d dreamed of
becominga lawyer or politician. _
In addition to studying abroad in Spain,
Morgan had takenpart in the Pitt in London

program.

Jeff Whitehead, director of Pitt’s Study.

Abroad Oﬂice, said that he asked students

who knew Morgan for stories about her. Al-
though he found no shortage of stories from
those who knew her, certain characteristics
shined through all of them. ‘

“She had a great and tremendous sense
of what was right and what was fair,” White-
head said. ‘ p ’ b

He also described her as someone who l
hada“lust for life.” ’  r V

Cameron, a junior, read a poem written by
two of Morgan’s other friends. The poem in-
cludes phrases such as, “Outstanding towards
her companions” and single words, including
“supportive” and “independent.”

Cameron said that Morgan’s family chose
not to attend the service, which coincided
with afootball game in which one of Morgan’s
younger brothers was playing.

“Because that’s what Oeshae would have
wanted,” she said. °

Columnist

The workaholic mentality isn’t
sbmething‘-that Americans are
surprised to hear themselves as-
sociated with.-:v,._I,/lle work a lot. Be-
cause I’m a college student, this
workaholic mentality causes me
to go through” an entire thought
process befofe consuming my
morning cup o;f;coﬁ'ee: How much
coffee am I alliiwed to drink for
the work I havégto do before class?
Will I take  now so I’m awake
during class later? And of course: I
have to balanciéimy caffeine intake
and my anxietyilevels so I don’t get
 during discus-
sion again-  s _

- t And this is just thegpi-ocess I
go through so ‘I can educate my-
self and then become an actual
workaholic. The workaholic life-
style is starting to reach a lower
age group, and because it pushes
past the acceptable demographic,
it has thus created detrimental
consequences.

Sure, there are deﬁnitely pros
to this -for some.
As Americans, we work hard

.— make money —— play hard

—— usually spending that ‘money
— and are productive: In short,
we don’t sleep. There’s a certain
power high that comes after we
cross off the tasks on our to—do
lists. While many of us end our
days exhausted, we are ultimately
satisﬁed by the amount that we’ve
accomplished. . _ g

_ Conversely, there are down-
sides. _

For one, there’s the fact that
we’ve somehow evolved into a
culture of constantly moving in-
dividuals, hoping to push the limit
of what we can accomplish in a

OPINIONS

day. Between the amount of cof-
fee, snacks, smoke _breaks,5-hour
Energy shots and meditation ses-
sions, it’s safe to say that we’ve be-
come accustomed to doing what-
ever it takes to ﬁnish that to-do
list. It seems that we would rather
strive to become superhumans in
order to accomplish more in our
day than live and truly enjoy it. I’m
obviously not implying that we’re
killing ourselves by adopting this
workaholic nature, ‘but it seems
that having a relaxed, slow-paced
lifestyle is almost unfathomable
by the American workaholic’s
standards.

As I said earlier, this isn’t any- I

thing new for us, so I’m not advo-
cating that we change our ways
completely. Truthfully, I don’t

think we can change our worka-

holic lifestyle. There is a stigma
attached to‘ citizens of this coun-

V try who do not comply with our

notions of what it means to work
hard. But while we can’t change
this mentality, we can strive to
keep it within its designated lim-
its, which have proven to be se-
verely threatened. .

This workaholic lifestyle - is

starting to reach a lower age

group, pushingpast the acceptable
group of college students and into
the age range of high schoolers.
Last month, Linkedln, the popu-
lar professional social network-
ing site, lowered its age group to

-13-year-old in certain countries,

including the United States.‘ On
this change, Eric Heath, the leader
of LinkedIn’s Global Privacy Pro-
gram, said, “Smart, ambitious stu-
dentsyare already thinking about
their futures when they step foot
into high school — where they
want to go to college,-what they

want to study, where they want to
live and work. We want to encour-
age these students to leverage the
insights and connections of the
millions of successful profession-
als on LinkedIn, so they can make
the most informed decisions and
start their careers off right.”

Now there’s no turning back
from the workaholic lifestyle,
but when we’re willing to bring
in people as young as freshmen
high school into the professional
mindset, I think we’ve gone a bit
too far. . .

It’s one ‘thing to spend your
high school years working hard
to meet your college or postgradu-

‘ation goals. After all, for aVstag—

gering amount of students, little
hard work or scholarship poten-
tial in high school correlates to
little ﬁnancial opportunity for
college. Butattaching the title
“professional” anywhere near a
teenager is ‘a different story, and
Linkedln isn’t the ﬁrst to suggest
this. The amount of internships
that high school students under-

take — which usually entail mind- ‘

less tasks such as coffee-fetching
rather than an actual introduc-
tion to the ﬁeld —— has steadily
increased in recent years.

And we seem to forget that
adolescence is complicated? and
plagued with social anxiety. The
awkwardness and misplaced feel-
ings of adolescence reality —-— cue
my audible crying during a screen-

ing of “This Is 40” — are already a_
‘hefty enough task to take on at the

age.’ It seems a bit cruel to ﬁirther

' the fragility of this age by adding .

the pressure of owning a proﬁle
on a professional site.

Moreover, Heath’s presumption that
“_smart, ambitious students” have an idea
of where they want to end up seems a bit

  

narrow range of subjects from which stu-

levels at stake here.

‘ For a sad, but realistic majority of peo-
ple, adolescence is the last time we think
we can accomplish anything we want in
the world and that we’ll end up in exactly

that getting into Harvard Law is as easy
as Elle Woods made it look, that a certain

someone who’s incredibly nostalgic about
this optimism, I think it’s important that
we preserve it because once it’s gone, it’s

 gone for good.

While certain people obviously do end
up where they had envisioned, the truth is
that the difficulty of growing up lies in the
fact that this pursuit is going to be very
difﬁcult and often has its destination never
fully met. Why make that realization come
any sooner than it has to? ill

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

To the Editor, _

There is no doubt gun violence is a serious public—health problem impacting the health
and well—being of men, women and children living in the United States. What we know less
about is how to effectively prevent the increasing number of related deaths and injuries. For-
tunately, the recent National Institutes of Health ﬁinding announcements for research on the
health determinants and consequences of violence — and ‘particularly ﬁrearm violence — is
a critical catalyst for the development of urgently needed interventions and policy changes.

Gun violence in Allegheny County continues to persist. More than 100-homicides take
place each year, the majority of which are the result of guns, and approximately ﬁve times
as many assaults occur that do not result in death. In 2012, Pittsburgh saw approximately 14

homicides for every 10 0,000 residents. While other cities may experience higher homicide

rates, violence in Pittsburgh continues to disproportionately affect Aﬁ'ican—American men
in certain communities of the city. . -

The Community Violence Prevention Project at the Graduate School of Public Health’s
Center for Health Equity is working to create a comprehensive and enhanced understand-
ing of the reasons for homicides in Pittsburgh. Existing research has clearly shown that gun
violence is an extremely complex topic, one that is subject to a variety of inﬂuencing factors.
This points to the urgent need for efforts to address violence and homicide prevention at
multiple levels witl1in Pittsburgh communities. Through partnership and collaboration with
local organizations including adult and juvenile court, county jaﬂ, city and county social ser-
vice providers, trauma physicians, anti—gun violence advocates and community members,
the Violence Prevention Program is tackling the tough question of what needs to be done to
reduce the number of homicides and gun—related injuries in our communities. 3

MEN’S SOCCER

Panthers earn ﬁrst point in conference play

Andrew Stern
Staff I/I/riter A

The Pitt men’s soccer team played Virgin-
ia Tech to a scoreless tie Tuesday evening
at Ambrose Urbanic Field.

The match featured just ﬁve saves

from the goalies and 22 shots on goal I

through 110 minutes. The draw was the
ﬁrst point the Panthers have earned in
conference play, and it came on a night
when the team was missing key members
of its back line. i

“The back line played well tonight,
but the team asa whole played pretty
well,” head coachjoe Luxbacher said. “We
played better tonight than we have the
last few games. Tonight.the guys played
good defensive soccer and took care of

the ball. Virginia Tech is a good team, and 3

they’ve had some good results against
top teams like North Carolina. They’re
a good solid team for sure.”

In the ﬁrst half, Pitt (0-6-3, 0-5-1

ACC) and Virginia Tech (3—3—4, 1-1-4 ACC)
played evenly, with the Panthers gaining
the only two chances to score. On the best
of the two opportunities, senior forward
Chris Davis did a fantastic job of control-
ling the ball in the Hokies’ box and riﬂed a
shot toward the net, forcing Virginia Tech
goalie Kyle Renfro to make a toe save.

Following the pair of chances, the two
teams played the ‘remaining 15 minutes
of the ﬁrst half without incident.

After the halftime break, neither team
could assert itself. The Hokies had their
only real chance to score when, in the
77th minute, forward Brandon Eaton
ﬁred a dangerous shot that Pitt redshirt
junior Cory Werth was able to clear out.

Following the Virginia Tech chance
late in the second half, the Panthers
brought on freshman midﬁelder Sam
Marks, who nearly scored on multiple
occasions. « s s

“It was good to get into the game and

log my ﬁrst action of the season,” Marks
said. “I’ve been working hard to get into
a game all season, so when I ﬁnally did, I
just tried to make the best of it.”

In the overtime periods, the two teams
played on even levels, with the Panthers
having the only real chance to score. In
the ﬁrst overtime, Davis had a clear run to
the net, though the chance was thwarted
once he tripped over the ball and allowed
the Hokies to clear it.

Following Davis’ slip, neither team had
a legitimate shot to score the golden goal
of the match, and the game to ended in
a scoreless tie. - '

Wile the point may not seem like a
big deal for a team that has struggled
mightily in conference play, sophomore
midﬁelder Nick Wysong sees the result
as a possible catalyst.

“Tonight’s result is hopefully a step-
ping stone to a better result in the fu-
ture,” Wysong said. “There’s a lot that

Midfielder Dan Prete registered a shot in
Tuesday’s tie. Jeff Ahearn [ Staff Photographer

Game 5 pitc ' g matchup: a showcase of dominant hurlers

Tyler Pecyna
Assistant Sports Editor

In the ﬁrst game of the Pirates—Cardina1s Na-
tional League Division Series, pitcher Adam
Wainwright threw 33 curveballs. Wainwright
offered fewer fastballs and cutters, 32 and 16,
respectively. His stats show he has a pretty
good idea of how to use what he’s got.

And what he happens to possess in that-

arsenal is a masterﬁil curve, apitch that leaves
his_ hand mimicking a 93 mph fastball before it
descends about nine inches, comes in about 15
mph slower and leaves major leaguers looking
like Pony Leaguers.

Google search Wainwright and look at
the suggested queries. After sifting through
the general top entries, such as “Adam Wain-

wrightjenny Curry,” who is his wife; “Adam ‘

Wainwright ESPN” or “Adam Wainwright
contract,” Google offers a dirty suggestion.
“Adam Wainwright curveball GIE”

It’s such a nasty pitch that I advise not
clicking through the brief clips while at work
or school. ,

There’s a GIF of Wainwright serving the
breaking ball to Diamondbacks inﬁelder Cliff
Pennington. Pennington is batting left-hand-
ed on a3-2 pitchwith men on ﬁrst and second
with one out. The pitch leaves Wainwright’s
ﬁngertips while his hand snaps in a down-
ward motion, a split second of mechanics
that generates a tight rotation and spin on the
baseball. Pennington watches the pitch out
of the hand and must be thinking, “Fastball,
ball four, we’re in business now.”

So Pennington waits, assuming it’s ashoul—
der-high, walk-inducing offering. Of course,
then Wainwright’s curve, well, curves down
into the strike zone. Pennington’s reaction is
priceless.. He sees the umpire ring up strike
three, then rests his bat on his shoulder as
he stares dumbly toward the dugout, realiza-

tion that he fell for the deceptive pitch ﬁnally Z

dawning on him. Pennington arches his back

a bit in what appears to be a ﬁill-body wince,
extends and kicks his straightened left leg
over the plate and then takes the long ﬁrst
step of an even longer walk back to the dugout,

where he’s safe from the curveball for at least .

a couple innings. I

And now, with Wainwright starting to-
night’s’s deciding game of the National League
Division Series, the Pirates face the possibility
of their own Pennington moment — with

more weight than a bat on their shoulders —

and a much longer post—defeat trek back to
Pittsburgh.

In Game 1, the hitters had plenty of op-
portunities to practice shufflingback to the
dugout, enjoying the majestic sight of the
Gateway Arch looming over the St. Louis
skyline and trying to forget the strikeout that
just occurred. . s

The 32-year-old Wainwright struck out
nine Pirates in seven innings of dominating
work, the linchpin to a 9-1 Cardinals victory.
He threw the curveball_for 31.4 percent of his

105 pitches, generating awhiifon one-third
of those curves, accordingto Brooks Baseball
and Pitch Info. He threw it 18 times when the
batter had two strikes in the count and 27.3
percent of the time when batters had three
balls in the count. .

In case it’s not clear by now, the Pirates
need to be able to handle Wainwright and his
devastating weapon of a pitch.

Baseball Info Solutions has documented
every one of Wainwright’s pitches in the ma-

jors, and. the site says he’s thrown a curveball
24.1 percent ofthe time. Fangraphs, asite that

features a pitch-tracking tool called Pitchlbc, .

lists that he’s thrown 4,092 curveballs since
Pitchlix was created in 2007.

Against those offerings, opposing hitters
have posted an embarrassing .189 weighted
on-base average — an all-encompassing of-
fensive metric — and an anemic .164 average.
To lend some perspective, Braves pitcher Mike

Minor posted a .188 wOBAand .164 average in
70 plate appearances this season. Wainwright,

who is a solid hitting pitcher, put up a .206 j

wOBA and .211 average this year, therefore
making him more likely to get a hit against
any pitch than anyone has against his curve.
Wai'nwright’s ciirveball has turned very
good hitters into the equivalent of a pitcher
stepping into the batter’s box.
It doesn’t éxactlylookpromisingfor Pitts-

burgh.

But the series andthe season are not over
yet. Pirates fans, ﬁnd ballast in Wainwright’s
mound opponent, 23-year-old Gerrit Cole.

Colewasthe Pirates’ answerto Wainwright .

after Game 1, as the rookie right—hander
tossed six innings of two-hit, one—run baseball
en route to a7-1 Pirates win inthe second game
of the series. And while he doesn’t feature
a similarly crushing pitch like Wainwright
— yet — Cole’s arsenal inspires hope that
the Pirates can at least get themselves into a
pitching and defense duel.

relies heavily on his high-90s fastball, which
is ﬁne for now because he induces high whiff
rates..In Game 2, Cardinals hitters swung and
missed on 37.2 percent of Cole’s fastballs, and
his ancillary offerings posed nearly just as
tough a challenge for hitters to make contact.
Cole’s pedigree and performance are
uplifdng and reminiscent of another rookie
pitcher in the 2006 playoffs—Wainwright..'
This 25-year-old formerﬁrst—rounder ap-
peared only in relief for the Cardinals, but he
was nonetheless electric. He pitched 9 2/3
innings that postseason, allowing no rims
and seven hits while striking out a Whop-

ping 15 batters. He picked up four saves and
a championship ring, as he recorded the ﬁnal

out against the Tigers in Game 5 of the World .

Series.

Off to a ﬂying start in his postseason de-

but already, Cole has the chance to make a
similar impact as this talented right-hander
did in 2006. ’

The best part?

Cole is presented with this opportunity
against that same star pitcher, who happened
to perfect one of baseball’s ﬁlthiest pitches
since then: Adam Wainwright. I"
