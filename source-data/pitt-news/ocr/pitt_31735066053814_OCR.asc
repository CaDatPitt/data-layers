Student Health Services hosts CPR classes

Zachariah Blott

.- 5 » .i".»>:.

Students _can learn just about
anything at a university, and the
Student Health Service is sponsor-
ing two programs on how to save a
life.

One of the more popular pro-
grams the Student Health Service
[SHS] makes available, especially
among pharmacy and physical ther-
apy students, is CPR course C.

Dr. Shirley Haberman, health
administrator at SHS, said the pop-
ularity of the course stems from the
thoroughness of the teaching and

 

the universal applications of its
contents.

Haberman said Course C certi-
fication differs from a Course A
certification because it includes
instruction for performing CPR on

children and

infants, as well

as adults. - H
Because the it *

American Heart *‘
Association [AHA] conducts the
monthly courses, many people
other than students attend the $15
class ($20 for non-students)
because they need the AHA certifi-
cation as a prerequisite for jobs as

‘lifeguards or aerobics instructors.

“The American Heart
Association puts on the set of
classes about once a month to keep
up with the demands,” said Rob
Varga, the CPR and first aid coordi-

. nator at the

A Health Education

, Office. “By last

‘ November, they

  “ *' c  were giving the

class twice a month because there

were so many requests to take the
class.”

The class is also popular with
many of the students studying to go

Golden Key Honors Society cleans up the city

Monica Mayk

 

After a years hiatus, Pitt’s Golden
Key Society is trying to build a stronger
relationship between Pitt and its sur-
rounding community.

The academic honors society is try-
ing to improve relations in the area by
taking part in litter control projects and
marathons to raise money for the needy.

Last year at this time, Pitt Golden
Key Society President Susan Selai took
over the leadership of an inactive and
apathetic organization. This year, after
working to organize the group and get

members more involved, Selai has plans
not only to make Golden Key more
active on campus, but to gain communi-
ty visibility and positive recognition for
Pitt.

Selai said that she stepped into the
presidency last fall after the society
spent the previous year completely inac-
tive on campus. 5

“My primary focus was to develop
a foundation to help Golden Key mem-
bers become involved,” she said. “The
members are a large group of very intel-
ligent, bright, charismatic people. I
don’t feel it’s that they don’t want to be
involved, but that they need good lead-

ership.”

More than 230 Golden Key Honor
Society chapters entertain over 600,000
members made up of the top 15 percent
of juniors and seniors on university
campuses throughout the world.

Golden Key offers career assistance
to its members, as well as leadership
opportunities and scholarships. Plus,
members can contribute to nationally-
sponsored publications like their
Concepts Annual Magazine. As chapter
president, Selai undertakes the task of

organizing local chapter—sponsored

activities.

Trustees ,
approve
raises for
top officials

§<=°" Lynch

 

The Board of Trustees approved
raises for six administrators, including
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg, at their
meeting last Wednesday. '

Chancellor Nordenberg will now
receive an annual salary of $225,000
with an incentive program of $30,000
based on whether or not he reaches the
Trustees’ ﬁve resolutions for increasing
academic excellence in the University.

. “We want to focus our energies in
ways to advance the institution,” said J.
Wray Connolly, chairman of the
Compensation Committee. “This
amount [of money] is modest com-
pared to those received by others.”

The five resolutions Chancellor
Nordenberg must satisfy to receive his
$30,000 bonus include an increase in
academic standards, in-depth review
and analysis of the University’s organi-
zational structure, securing an adequate
research base, maintaining excellence
in research, and stimulating regional
economic activity and the creation of
new jobs.

The current salary for the
Chancellor is the projected amount that
previous Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor would have received if he
were still employed by the University.
The $3,500 raise will include the salary
increase , Nordenberg would have
received as permanent chancellor but
did not when he was elected June 20,
1996 as interim chancellor of the
University.

Five. other senior officials also
received a new salary and benefits
package for the 1996 and 1997 school

MOSCOW - Boris Yeltsin may be more ill
than oﬂicials are letting on. Accordingto a
former aide, he sulfers problems with his
back, hearing, and blood vessels in his brain
and has liver and kidney problems that have
been accelerated by his drinking problem.

The claims of Yeltsin’s former press sec-
retary, Pavel Voshchanov, only deepened the
intrigue Sunday surrounding the true condi-
tion of the 65-year-old Russian presidcnt’s
health.

Voshchanov’s disclosures followed sug-
gestions by the chief surgeon for Yeltsin’s
upcoming‘ heart bypass surgery that aides
covered up a Yeltsin heart attack in the clos-

The president of the American
University of Beirut, who must adminis-
ter his institution from another conti-
nent, paid a visit to Pitt this weekend.

Robert M. Haddad, a Pitt alumnus,
was appointed to his position in July of
1993, but is forbidden to relocate in
Beirut due to the U.S. State
Department’s ban on American travel to
Lebanon.

“I don’t enjoy this arrangement,”
Haddad said, “but it has been dictated to
me by the U.S. govemment.”

Despite the ban, Haddad is still
working hard to restore this prestigious
university to the stature it once held. The
visit to Pitt is part of these efforts.

“I am here to revive a dormant
alumni chapter,” he said, referring to the
over 40 American University of Beirut
[AUB] graduates living in the Pittsburgh
area.

Haddad met with these graduates at
a reception at Pitt on Sunday afternoon.
He urged them to take active roles in this
revitalization of the AUB chapter.

“We are making progress, but, like
any other university, we need the neces-
sary funds to make our goals become
reality,” he said. ‘

The university’s Beirut library and
an adjoining classroom building suf-
fered $20 million in damage during a
1991 car bomb explosion. However,
Haddad insists it was a ﬂuke attack and
that it is now relatively safe in Beirut.

“There has been virtually no vio-
lence in Lebanon since the peace accord
was reached in 1990,” he said.

Haddad says fear of violence should
not deter efforts to rehabilitate the Beirut
university.

“This university was the best invest-
ment the U.S. government ever made in
the Mid—East region,” he said. “It plays a
salient role in the lives of people in that
area.” '

Maxine Bruhns, an AUB alurrma
and director of Pitt’s Nationality Rooms,
echoed Haddad’s sentiments. She said
that many AUB alumni ﬁgure promi-
nently among Middle Eastern govem-
mental and business leaders.

“The university has become a for-
midable American academic presence in
the area,” Bruhns said.

Bruhns also played a role in
Haddad’s visit to Pitt. She, along with
other members of Pittsburgh’s Syrian
and Lebanese community, hosted a din-
ner in his honor Sunday night. The din-
ner also marked the reactivation of Pitt’s
Syria—Lebanon Room Committee.

On Monday, Haddad met with
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg and mem-

Haddad appreciates all the support
he has received in his efforts to restore
the university, but said the biggest key
for further development will be the lift-
ing of the ban against American travel to
Beirut.

“Not only does it prohibit
Americans from traveling there, but it
sends out a negative image that keeps

into the health professions. Varga
said that these classes are held each
week just for the students of phar-
macy, therapy, and other medical
fields. The turnout for these weekly
classes averages around 12 people.

Class sizes for the monthly
courses are cut off at 18 people, and
sometimes the AHA needs to turn
students away, according to Varga.

“I took the course because it was
required I recertified in Course C
CPR to be an EMT,” said
Christopher Derek, a Pitt student
who recently completed the CPR
classes. '

The cost of these programs is
generally cheaper than at other

 

' places that offer similar training.

“Fifteen dollars didn’t seem like
a lot of money compared to the $30
I usually see for training like this,”
said Derek.

Students who missed the
September course can keep their
eyes open because the October
course is coming up soon.

The American Red Cross will
also be conducting a three-hour
course on general first aid for stu-
dents and the public on Sept. 30 at
6:30 p.m.

Haberman said that this course
is a basic first aid certification
course that is useful in dealing with
adults, children, and infants.

To register for the first aid class,
students can go to the Health
Education Office on the fifth floor
of the Medical Arts Building and
present a CPR card that has been
validated within the last year. The
cost is $30 for Pitt students and $35
for non-students. ,

Anyone with questions about
either of these programs can call the
Health Education Office at 383-
1830.

For their first event this year, the Pitt
chapter will induct new members at their
annual Golden Key Society New
Member Reception to take place on
Oct. 6 at 6 p.m. in the Bellefield
Auditorium.

William Pitt Union room 504 will
house meetings at 8:30 p.m. on Sept. 24
and Oct. 1 to finalize plans for the induc-
tion ceremony. The society will run new
officer elections on Oct. 22.

 

she believes that student participation in

‘community service projects like the ones

the Golden Key sponsors, as well as the
academic recognition the society, offers
beneﬁts students, community and the
University’s reputation in the city’s eyes.

Citing a recent issue involving the
city of Pittsburgh as well as Pitt, Selai
said, “If an organization like Golden

ty I think the community would be more

receptive to issues such as the Bigelow
closing. There would be a greater appre-
ciation for what the University does.”

Even before the induction ceremo-
ny, the Golden Key Society welcomes
input from prospective members at all
meetings.

 

Existing members already conduct-
ed their first two meetings for this school
year, with 35 prospective members in
attendance, a much larger number than
previous years, according to Selai.

Although she expects at least 200
new members to be inducted at the Oct.
6 ceremony, Selai said many members
join for the career assistance opportuni-
ties and fail to get involved in the service
activities.

However, the fact that 35 new peo-
ple are already attending meetings and
helping to plan the upcoming ceremony
before becoming ofﬁcial members, it
shows increased interest over past years.

For the upcoming semesters, Selai
plans to get the society and the
University involved in a litter control * . g = .
project known as the “Pittsburgh _  i Q

 ,§I.,t..§$$§$»..m.
.w.................. m

Project,” and a Run/Walk marathon to i  ‘ ' 
beneﬁt Operation-Save-A-Life, as well '   ‘
as Project Tutor. Selai said she hopes to
form an alliance between the University
and the Pittsburgh community by mak-
ing Golden Key more visible through
these projects. _ _ 
“Golden Key can help raise the rep- ; " t - ‘W’
utation of this university within the local ’ "
community by presenting the University _ _
as caring and involved and willing to ' 1 . " g 
give something back to the community,” " ' 
Selai said. M "
Operation-Save—A-Life, which the
society will help with their spring
run/walk, is a local project created to
help local homeless with food and shel-
ter and to assist in keeping homeless
families together during shelter stays. ‘ . . 
Selai said that the society could  "  
have chosen to participate in a more
popular benefit, like one to help
Children’s Hospital, but decided on
Operation-Save—A—Life because it will
help a different aspect of the communi-

ty.

working toward her psychology degree

tries away, too,” Haddad said. “Lifting

FROM PAGE 1

the ban would be a strong symbol of

trust and show that things are OK
again.”

It would also make Haddad’s job as
university president easier. As it is, he
conducts most of his administrative
duties from a New York office via phone
and fax. Occasionally, he has met with
university constituents at remote neutral
sites in Syria and Cypress.

Haddad said that he relies on a
strong group of deans to help him design
and implement the curriculum. He said
that he would have given this group the
academic freedom they currently enjoy
even if he was present at the campus.

“I’m not about to tell someone how
to run the computer science department
when I can barely use a word processor
myself,” Haddad said.

Haddad is getting some reprieve in
his ﬁght against the ban forbidding
American travel to Beirut. He received a
two—week waiver of .the ban in
December of 1995 that allowed him to
make his first visit to the campus as
president.

He has also been able to work out a
deal with the State Department that will
allow him to travel to Beirut for a period
of ten days once every three months.
Haddad will take whatever breaks he
can, but said he still wishes for a total
removal of the ban.

“I would go and reside there as
quickly as possible ifI were permitted to
do so,” he said.

The 67-year-old Haddad says he has
no fear about living at the university.
However, he travels in a bulletproof lim-
ousine surrounded by a cavalcade of
police officers when he is permitted to
make brief visits there.

Bruhns appreciates the danger of
Haddad’s situation. “Recalling the mur-
der of past president, Malcolm Kerr,
who was shot in the stairway outside of
his office on the AUB campus in 1984,
one can begin to understand the unique
circumstances of his position,” she said.

Haddad said he puts aside personal
fears for the needs of the school. _

“I need to spend at least three years
living on the campus to accomplish the
thing I planned to get done,” Haddad
said.

In addition to changing the school’s
image and acquiring funds, he also
would like to regionalize the school’s
curriculum to better suit the students’
needs.

Prior to accepting his position as
president, Haddad was a professor of
history and religion at Smith College "in
Northampton, Mass.

He graduated from Pitt in 1952 with
a B.S. in psychology. He also has earned
a Master’s degree in Near Eastern stud-
ies from the University of Michigan, and
a PhD. in history and Middle Eastern
studies ﬁom Harvard University.

Overcoming apathy requires leadership

 

Time and again, we Pitt students are
bombarded with allegations of apaﬂiy
and indiﬁerence from those outside of
our inner circle. These allegations have
been reiterated in countless The Pitt
News articles about podunk candidates’
half-assed suggestions for student voter
registration, and the SGB’s fruitless
attempts at getting Pitt students to care
about anything. After reading many of

, these articles, I ﬁnd myself asking for

speciﬁcs. Pitt students are apathetic?
Apathetic about what? Indifferent
towards whom? To which many of my
writers usually, and appropriately, just 
shrug.

At ﬁrst, I found myself, being a Pitt
student, shrugging as well.

What is missing from our lives?
Maybe this apathy is the result of the
lackluster performance of our football
team, which seems to get beaten more
than the kid in grade school with the eye
patch. However, I think that our losing
sports record may be more of an effect
thancauseofthisgreat apathy. I

Maybe it’s something in the water,
who knows? Even then, it would only
aifect the weak and the elderly. I think
our problem goes much deeper than the
opposing team’s score in a Panther foot-
ball game or the pipes in Litchﬁeld
Towers.. Our University is lacking one
almighty element that makes any soci-
ety great:- we have no leaders.

Leaders don’t follow rules, they don’t
deal with bureaucratic mumbo jumbo.
Leaders live life like one big Mentos
commercial, forging a path through apa-
thy and indifference like some mighty
road connecting Forbes Avenue and
Fifth between the Cathedral of Leaming

V and the student union.

Where do we ﬁnd these leaders? The
media can’t do it; our job is to sit back
and watch the action like an oﬂ°—duty cop
at the “O.” We HAVE to remain indif-
ferent. What is needed is a position
steeped in tradition, firm which a male
and a female student can reign over us
— benevolent rulers of a tumultuous
kingdom. They must be tyrannical and
bloodthirsty. They must not be afraid to
clash with society and to wage wars for
our goodwill on the streets “of Oakland.
But where can we ﬁnd such a person?
WHERE?

And then, it struck me.

I was standing in the Towers’ court-
yard staring up at a ﬁeshly-posted sign
imploring me to vote for some pretty
girl as Homecoming queen. I thought,
“You know, they don’t just put up these
signs for people to draw mustaches on.
Damn it, these people mean something
to this school!” So I put away my black
magic marker and considered how the
Homecoming king and queen might
relieve us lowly Pitt students of the
indifference that devours us daily.

Don’t vote for a king because he '

knows how to superimpose a picture of
himself with Darth Vader. Don’t cast
your ballot for just a pretty face splat-
tered on the wall, like the remains of a
“Glamour Shots’_’ studio that exploded
Vote for the Homecoming queen and
king who are not afraid to be enraged,
and will stand up and inspire Pitt stu-
dents.

I want to see the Homecoming queen
splitting off chunks of Bigelow
Boulevard with a sledgeharnmer and
stacking them in front of Jim Fer1o’s
oﬂice door, blocking him inside until
our demands are met

The Homecoming king could lead a

brigade of CAS students against
Carnegie Mellon and claim their new
student union as our own. That thing is
huge! IfPitt’s going to make a land grab,
let’s go all the way.
These Homecoming Monarchs
should get into the dirty streetﬁghting
each student goes through daily on their
way to class. Let them lead a torch-
wielding mob of angry students against
the parihandlers. We don’t need them
hanging around the 7-11, begging for
pur precious beer and cigarette money.
If we need something to" make us feel
guilty, We’ll consider the factthat it takes
lVlTVtomakeus1ealizethisisanelec—
tion year.
The most important thing our king
and queen need is to become angry

reactionaries. Our Homecoming mon- ’

archs shouldn’t feel any more self-con-
scious ﬁring crates of Choice Dollar-
purehased Ramen noodles through the
windows of McCormick Hall in protest
of the new IDs than those present at the
Boston Tea Party.

Their reign doesn’t have to be com-
pletely hostile. Sit-ins at the Pitt book-
store to protest the ridiculously high
prices would be a peaceful way of ﬁght-
ing nithless oppression, and at least the
students could read the books for free
while they sat there.

The list of issues to address goes on
and on, but it’s up to our future king and
queen to be one step ahead of our time
and to lead Pitt students into a majestic
dynasty of honor and power.

We’ll ﬁnally have meaning in our
lives, and the extraordinary feeling of
honor, as we raise a glass of bacteria-
heavy water in praise of our new, pas-
sionate, king and queen.

Politicians should
know: go with
the dark horse

 

Don’tt1ust Bob Dole.

There is no way that a man who could
lead our nation can be so ignorant.-

Now, before you conservatives start
jumping on my back, I’m not talking about
political policies.

 
   

World Champion
favorites tl1e...I§IaIional..,

pesky Montreal Expos in order to reach their
ﬁrst post season since 1984. But neither the
Padres nor the Cardinals have the oifensive
punch to stack up to the Dodgers.

So while politicians are boring the
American people with talk about unemploy-
ment and cutling taxes, why not put your
money on a sure bet — the LA Dodgers.

Volleyball turns

Marc R

Jennie Driscoll earned
her third all-tournament honor
in four tries as the Pitt Volley-
ball team played to a 1-2
record in this weekend’s
American University Armand
Classic in Washington, D.C.

Pitt (6-8) swept an inex-
perienced American
University team on Friday
before falling to 13th—ranked
Wisconsin and Butler on
Saturday in what was a frus-
trating ﬁve—game loss.

Butler (11-4) crawled
through its first three games
against Pitt before putting the
match away, 9-15, 15-12, 8-
15, 15-8 and 15-8. The
Bulldogs were hitting‘ at a kill
average of .195 through three
games before pumping their
percentage up to .348 in game
four and .389 in the final stan-
za.

Pitt had played Wisconsin
about two hours before.

' “I _don’t know if fatigue
was a factor,” said Head
Coach Cindy Alvear, “but we

' had to warm up [for] an hour

and a ‘half after playing
VV1sconsin.”

Classic

Alvear said that emotions

could have been a factor in the.

match against the Bulldogs.

Amy Pickett was a
wrecking machine for Butler,
firing a team-high and touma-
ment-best 30 kills against the
Panthers. Pickett earned all-
invitational honors for the
Armand Classic.

“She was huge,” Alvear
said. ‘The games that they got
her the ball were the the ones
that hurt us.”

Freshman Paula
Zemrowski served up a team-
high 18 kills against the
Bulldogs while three others
finished in double-digits as
well.

“Paula is an athletic 6-
foot-5,” Alvear said. “She will
eventually be one of the most
formidable players in the Big
East.”

Pitt’s earlier match
against No. 13 Wisconsin was
a one-sided affair. Yet to lose
this season, the Badgers (12-
0) dismantled the Panthers
15-3, 15-10 and 15-7, with a
.371’ team kill percentage.

kills in the match.

. The Badgers held
Driscoll to nine total kills.
Zerrirowski led the Panthers
with 11 kills in the thre
games. ~

For host American

University ‘(3-9), Pitt was.

actually their toughest oppo-
nent. The Big East squad
swept the Lady Eagles 15-5,
15-3 and 16-14.

Pitt used a balanced
attack to dismantle the

Colonial Athletic Conference ,

team. Five players ﬁnished
the match with at least 5 kills
or better. Stephanie Dufresne
averaged better than 10 assists
per game against American.
The senior setter ﬁnished the
tournament with 128 assists.
Senior Jennie Driscoll led
the Panthers with 34 kills, 27
digs, two aces and a .387 kill

Adamson’s late kick lifts cross country

ff Mk 5

After last Saturday’s Spiked Shoe

Invitational cross country meet at Penn
State University, the Pitt men’s and
women’s cross country teams have a
model of improvement to look at.

Pitt senior Ed Adamson ﬁnished
second in the 5.2 mile men’s race with a

time of 26:43. Penn State’s Che.

Arosemena won the event in 26:20.

Arosemena, Adamson, and a group
of several others ran together for the first
half of the race. About midway through,
the home course advantage kicked in
and Arosemena pulled away. 0

“At about the four-mile mark, Ed
stopped racing the leader and started
thinking ‘What am I going to do with
these guys around me?”’ said Pitt Coach
Dave Sobal.

For a while, he didn’t do much. It
wasn’t until the last 300 meters that

Adamson took control. His ﬁnish, “by

  far the strongest on the team,” according

to Sobal, shaved seconds off his time
and was the factor that put him in sec-
ond place rather than a few spots down.

“Our team needs to realize that

there’s no magical thing he did,” Sobal
said. “He’s been - training consistently
for a year. His improvement is not a sur-
prise. It’s been a long time coming.”
' Adamson wasn’t the only Panther
to have a good race. Rich Walsh, Scott
Gilpen, Matt Samuel, and Scott Curry
ran most of the race near each other.
They overcame sickness, sore ham-
strings, and a fall in the first mile of the
race and ﬁnished in the top 40, within 27
seconds of each other.

Pitt’s men edged out Cortland State
and Rider for third place in the meet
with 113 points. Penn State won the
meet with 26 points.

Sobal was pleased with the aggres-
sive races run by both the men and the

r » I , '.«

women. The women, however, had less
to show for their efforts than the men.

“Our top three, along with Erin
Tulley, ran well,” Sobal said.

Pitt’s top ﬁnisher was Stephanie
Ellsworth in 18:54, good enough for
ninth place. Amy Francy came in 28th
place with a time of 19:37 and Lynda
Andros ﬁnished in 19:56, herfrst time
ever under 20 minutes. Tulley was 55th
in 21:05. Penn State swept the top three
places in the race, led by Kim
McGreevy in 17:34.

The main disappointment for Pitt
was Stacey Anderson, who was 39th in
20:08.

“Stacey just had a bad day. She felt
badly about it,” Sobal said.

Like the men, Pitt’s women’s team
was in a group of teams close together in
the middle of the pack. Unlike the men,
the women came out closer to the bot-
tom than the top.

How to achieve fitness success

Kathy Segal

 

Staying “ﬁt” isn’t about lifting record
amounts of weight. It’s about plain old living
— being able to change a tire in 99—degree
weather, or walking up and down hills to get
to class during the Blizzard of ‘96.

Aﬁinge beneﬁt of staying ﬁt is a positive
self—irnage because you look better. This car-
ries over to all aspects of life, both personal
and professional.

The human body is more complex than
any machine known on earth. It performs
best when maintained properly, on a regular
basis, over the course of a long life — not
merely a seasonal health club membership.
Fitness can’t be stored up to be used later; it
requires consistency to improve your body
from the inside out.

But at what level do you want to be ﬁt?
That’ s up to you to decide. Whatever your
goals, these training tips should help you
maximize energy,  fatigue, and cre-
ate the potential for you to realize your per-
sonal best;

- Exercise is something you do for yourself,
not to yourself.

- Results in a ﬁtness program are determined
by three things: consistency, duration, and
effort. ’

- Determine why you are exercising. Then
choose the program that will fulﬁll your
goals.

- You can’t get in shape one day a week, so
be consistent. If your body is expecting a
workout on Friday, and you are inactive until
Monday, the training effect will not be addi-
tive due to over—resting.

- The best time to exercise is whenever you
are willing and able, for 30 to 60 minutes
three to ﬁve times per week.

- If weight loss is a primary goal, 200-300
calories must be expended daily through
moderate, continuous activity, and 200-300
calories must be eliminated from the total
daily diet.

- 30 minutes of continuous cardiovascular
activity and 20 minutes of uninterrupted
strength exercise will yield excellent results.
- Your intensity must match your level of
conditioning. Never over—exercise, especially
in the ﬁrst six weeks —— the desired results
will not come any sooner.

- During your cardio workout, always take
time to elevate the heart rate and time to
lower it. The oxygen-carrying blood that has
been pumped away from the brain needs to
be re—routed back properly. You are still burn-
ing fat during this cool-down.

- Visualize yourself performing an exercise
routine before you actually do it — then do it
0 Nutrition and _exercise must go hand in
hand

- The size of your waistline is determined by
the food you eat, not how many sit-ups you
do.

-Nevereatoutofabag, abox, orajar. Take
your serving and put the container away.

- Read labels! Only go by the serving size. If
ithasmorethan3 gramsoffatper100calo-
ries, ﬁnd something else!

0 “Bulking up” doesn’t yield muscle weight.
Your size comes from your weight training,
and the number of extra calories required to
sustain the added size is subjective to the indi-
vidual.

0 Try to eat as little white ﬂour and white
sugar as possible.

- Be aware of excess starch, easily consunred
without regard to calories (crackers, pretzels,
muﬂins, croutons, etc.). Many of these items
are also high in fat.

This weekend’s Armand Classic ﬁn-
ished off a month-long run of tourna-
ments for Pitt.

“We’ll be going through a ton of indi-
vidual work and some work on basic fun-
damentals for the next few days,” Alvear
said. “We’re also going to install some
new options, including some switch-
blocking to maneuver Paula [Zernrowski]
around more.” ‘

The Panthers now have nine days olf
to prepare for their inner-city battle with
Duquesne University. Next Thursday’s

match will take place at Penn-Trafford »
9 High School in Trafford, Pa.

“It’s possible that we could win all of
the matches for the rest of the year,”
explained Alvear. “With all the experi-
ence we’ve. gained from these tourna-

“We could’ve been second, but
nobody knows it but us,” Sobal said. “Of
course, a lot of other teams are probably
thinking that.”

Pitt was sixth with 138 points, only
27 behind second-place Cortland State.
Penn State ran away with the meet with
17 points, but they were not completely
unchallenged.

' ‘”They’re a nationally ranked team,”
Sobal said. “For Stephanie to run with
their top seven shows that she can run
with the best. And I think Stacey
would’ve been up there on a normal day
too.” —

Next weekend, Pitt travels to Miami
Univerisity in Ohio, a course the teams
ran on last year.

- Keep all joints (knees, hips, ‘ankles, shoul-
ders, elbows, wrists) in alignment during
exercise.

- Get as much fresh air as possible. Nothing
replaces Mother Nature.

- Balance your routine! Guys, get into an
exercise class. Ladies, pump a little more
iron.

- Ifyou have a speciﬁc concern or health con-
dition, consult a qualiﬁed health professional
about your weight-loss goals.

- Learn to enjoy your workouts. If you
become either bored or obsessed, your body
and mind will not reap the beneﬁts of stress
reduction.
