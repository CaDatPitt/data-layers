Loss of Tobacco Ads

Cigarette Manufacturers Drop

Campaign in College Papers

By LUCY CORRENTI

American tobacco -manufacturers’ decision to withdraw
their cigarette advertisements from college student publica-
tions threatens to. “substantially decrease the frequency of
circulation and size of each issue, in addition to the quality
of the news,” according to Ralph Albright, Pitt News Busi-

Political Scientist
To -Talk of Space
At Coffee Hour

Political Scientist Vernon Van
Dyke will be guest at a Coffee

' Hour and informal discussion at

3 p.m. today in the SU Lower
Lounge.

Dr. Van Dyke will answer stu-
denet questions about his lecture,
“Why Are We in Space?,” which
was presented at noon today in
the Midday Lecture Series.

' Dr. Van Dyke is now on leave
from the University of Iowa,
where he is chariman of the Po-

sides editing the Midwest Jour-
nal of Political Science for the
past three years, he has served
as a guest speaker at the Brook-

the America! Political Science
Association.

Van Dyke has published two

books: Political Science, a Philo-
sophical Analysis, and Interna-

tional Politics. He has also writ-
ten articles for several journals.

Work  City’s Hill District

(See Pitt News Review, Page 4)

The Pitt Volunteers sent twenty
tutors to the Soho and Anna B.
Heldman House to teach young
students from grades seven to
twelve on Monday and Tuesday.
Enrolled from the ranks of Uni-
versity students, the tutors em-
barked on an eight week program
which call for four hours of their
time a week.

At the community house in the
Hill District the volunteers are co-
operating with the educational
programs of the Hill Education
Project, an autonomus organiza-
tion concerned with both educa-
tion and civil rights.

Tom Mellers, Pitt Volunteer
chairman, said, “The educational
project is the only action that the
Volunteers has planned as an or-
ganization. If the tutors wish to
participate in other non—educa-
tional movements, then they are
free to do so as individuals.”

in orientation sessions held at the
community houses. Howard, Spo-
dek, a spokesman for the Hill Ed-
ucation Project tutors, said at the
Heldman House on Monday, “The
need is ti develop a direct student-
teacher relationship, one student
to one teacher.”

The University tutors that
were at Monday's or Tuesday’s
orientation enrolled in the pro-
gram either at last Wednesday’s
SUB forum or at the—ﬁrst orien-
tation session-held on Saturday.
Mrs.- Everard Pinneo, faculty
coordinator for the Volunteers,
said that the organization still
needs tutors for this trimester
and is taking applications for

Albright said that_ “last year
Dr. Thompson wanted to get rid
of cigarette advertising because
it is unethical, but we didn’t go

along with it as we felt The Pitt 4

News should not act as a parent
to the students. We shouldn’t cen-
sor advertising because of outside
pressures just as we shouldn’t
censor editorials.”

Dr. Douglas C. Thompson, di-
rector of the Student Health Ser-
vice, said, “For some time I’ve
thoughtthat college papers should
drop cigarette ads and take a
position on smoking. The" posi-
tion that the papers take is more
important than the presence or
absence of advertisements. Stu-
dents will be subject to cigarette
advertising from other sources.”

Half of Ad Revenue

‘Albright noted that “Cigarettes
constitute 50‘per cent of all our
national advertising.‘ Eight to ten
thousand dollars might be lost in
revenue for The Pitt News. If we
cannot make up this loss in rev-
enue, I feel that a substantial de-

crease in the frequency of circu-

lation and size of each issue will

, be necessary.

“In addition, the quality of
news will be substantially af-
fected because of limited space.
Matt Swetonic and I are plan-
ning strategy to offset this

is probable deﬁcit.”

Dr. Thompson “said, “I have
sympathy for The Pitt News in

losing this revenue. It is hard for

newspapers and tobacco compa-
nies to face up to the fact that
smoking is not good.”

Students’ comments on the is-
sue varied, but most agreed with
Stuart Bernstein.

Bernstein, an LA senior, com-
mented, “I don’t know why
smokers should not be made
aware of the brands on the mar-
ket through advertising. I don’t
think the presence or absence
of cigarette advertising in stu-
dent publications will affect the
number of smokers at all.”

A compromise, Whalen

situation, ‘immediately jumped
on the band-wagon and thus we
are faced with. the current boy-
cotte of advertising. For what
better way is there to reduce
criticism than by assuming the
guise of a protector of children’s
lusgs? Of course, the Institute
was not so foolish as to label
cancer the reason for their de-
cision. That would be an admis-
sion of guilt and the result might
well be ﬁnancially disasterous.

Therefore, with a look toward
the cash register as well as at
the‘ public image, the companies
planted their collective tongues
in their cheeks and announced
that smoking is an" adult habit
and since college students are
not quite adults, they would no
longer openly encourage smok-
ing on the college level.

TV Will Do
The important thing to be re-
membered in the Institute’s

stand is that although they will
no longer openly encourage col-

lege smoking, they have no in- 4

tention of reducing their adver-
tising in other media with which
the college student comes in
constant contact. There are very
few students, even in the most
remote Mississippi theological
seminary, who do not read at
least one non—college newspaper
or magazine, or do not watch a
number of cigarette-sponsored
television programs each week.

Therefore, the companies felt
that the step taken would do
much to abate the criticism
without seriously affecting sales.
In fact, by cutting out college
advertising the companies stand
to make a tidy profit.

In all probability, should it
deﬁnitely be proven that smok-
ing does not cause cancer, then
the Institute will suddenly real-
ize that it has made a mistake
and that college students are
most certainly adults and should
be granted all the privileges
thereof, e.g. that cigarettes are
good tension relivcrs and
should be bought in astronomic-
al amounts.

'To believe that the cigarette
companies are sincere in their
efforts to keep smoking an adult
habit requires the same kind of
mind which believes that Jimmy
Hoffa is an honest man or that
prayer will cure a broken arm.

Minutes after the theater lights dimmed and
ﬁgures splashed in technicolor began to cavort
across the screen, I got that strangefeeling in the
pit of my stomach which makes you undecided
whether to laugh or cry. I felt
a sudden revulsion for the whole »
American Film Industry because if
it keeps feeding the American"
public with a recipe which has
been the old standby for the past
ﬁve years-—the eternal triangle
of man, woman and the “other”
man or woman, handsome actors
and beautiful actresses against a 
backdrop of luscious (yes, lus- ‘
cious. You are supposed to eat
it up) scenery ﬁlmed in glorious . -
technicolor, little plot, scant but elegant costumes,
a dash of acting ability, and lots of sex. «

 

The movie that I was viewing, Bye, Bye Birdie, '

is a perfect product of this recipe. I was so sicken-
ed by the antics of the rock ’n roll singer Conrad
Birdie with his sprayed-on outﬁt of gold mesh (even
Elvis wasn’t that bad), the teenage girls of Sweet
Apple High and the mayor’s wife fainting at his
feet, and Rosie’s dance on the table tops in what
could have been an Elks’ meeting because a “good
girl” couldn’t win the love of Birdie’s songwriter,
that all made me long for the good old days of
cowboy movies. It was that bad.
Foreign Movies Bei-ier .
However, I’m happy to say that I’ve found a
better solution to the problem of American movies:
the foreign movie. In the past I always shrank from
going to see these “art” ﬁlms. Perhaps I was afraid
I would be publicly condemned like Volkswagen
owners or Mrs. Kennedy, for her love of French
‘fashions. Or it might be that I felt the English
sub-titles and "the foreign “gibberish” would be
worse than the old silent ﬁlms. _

movies led me to see Sundays and Cybele, which
turned out to be French, much to my delight. I’ve
plugged at the language for four years so that
now I can distinguish the first and last words of
any sentence a Frenchman utters. However, I used
the sub-titles as a crutch until two love birds sat
in front of me, blocking off the English words

entirely. Unable to move, I was forced to atternpt~ea5‘l

to comprehend the French.

It proved to be easier than I expected because
the leading actress was twelve years old and the
male star, a former wartime pilot, was a victim of
amnesia with an aura of child-like innocence and
a vocabulary to match. The girl was not beautiful,
but as mystifying as her name. “Cybele” suggests,
An Abandoned Cybele

her father and placed in-a convent school, child- ,

ish affection for Pierre—“When I am "eighteen ‘I 3'3 I
will marry you”—‘-and her penchant for magic, she)"

was captivating.‘ _

Pierre, though 30, had a boyish look about him.
In his preoccupation with water and trees, pieces
of his shattered secret of wartime experience, he-
was searching for something. He tried to ﬁnd it
in his association with Cybele—in the ripples‘__form-
ed by tossing a pebble into the water which Cybele
called “our home”. He was a pathetic ﬁgure.

This association caused murmurs in the
audience. One woman exclaimed, “That’s too.

- Slingers

Some time ago the University played host to its-
alumni, and among other things, held a smorgas-
bord in the student cafeteria in the Student Union.
This was a ﬁne gesture on the part of the Univer-
sity‘ towards its former students '
if only it hadn't once again cast
aside the convenience of the
present day students paying as
much as $750 per trimester for
tuition alone. This is, not sur
prising, though, since the stu-
dents have already been turned
into mere IBM cards by the of-
ﬁce of, student records. But’ it
does raise some questions about
the superb service that Saga _
Food Service is ‘always bragging about.

For this glorious reunion, the cafeteria, in addi-
tion to being overcrowded, was made off-limits to

   

. all students who did not brandish the cafeteria

meal ticket. Charles F.Douglas, director of Saga
Food Service, stated, when asked, that approxi-
mately 95 students pay their way into the cafeteria
for dinner; ‘ yet on this one occasion when the
quality of the food was respectably decent, -they
were heartlessly turned away.

Of course, Mr. Douglas was ready with an ex-
planation: “They could eat in Hunt room or (Tuck
Shop.” For that matter, the students could even
shell out the alumni price of $3.75, which includ-
ed cost of numerous other ventures planned. But
then the Saga Food Service is a proﬁt making or-
ganization under the protective wings of the ad-
ministration. It realizes that anyone who can afford
to squander all that well-earned money at an in-
stitution that considers itself in the same bracket
as the Ivy League colleges of the East, can also
be made to pay extra for anything above the
quality of the usual slop being‘ dished out to the
card carrying students.

The cafeteria serves a deﬁnite purpose in ‘the

life of the college students here: it makes them

appreciate hotel food! Then, too, every now and
then Saga Food throws an extrra measure of diffi-
culty in the path of the students to give unexpected
spice to life. Last Monday, for example, the break-
last line extended from the cafeteria all the way
over to the SU desk; yet only one service counter
was being used, and if any students caught in the
sudden deluge of ignorant and innocent freshmen
had an eight o'clock class, that was just too bad-

They certainly knew how many of the‘ eager little

freshmen had been coralled by the University <

officials for this orientation session.‘They also knew
that summer registration for the University would

 be held Monday and that experienced students

after she had been given cash on the barrel or a
check for the amount. One would think that a

proﬁt making organization like Saga would jump .
. fat the opportunity to make some extra /money and

hire some extra help for this occasion. But Saga
is too‘ smart for even that. They.have a captured
clientele, and" they know it, and they exploit ‘it.
The card bearing students cannot escape the,-rush;

_if they do,’ so much the better. Saga has both its

money and the food it paid for. ‘For the rest, some
may patronize a nearby restaurant, but most like_
to remain within close proximity of the hub of
activities, and they will thus have no other choice
than to frequent one of the Saga ‘run establish-
ments sprinkled along the campus. So why employ
more people when one can manage with the present
help by overworking them?

Saga, in addition to handling the various ven-
tures in dishing outfood to the University com-5
munity, faculty and administration included, has
the monopoly on all cateringservices for any and
all affairs conducted? on the campus. In this unique
position, Saga prides itself ion providing exquisite-
ly prepared food at reasonable prices. The quality
of the food, however, is not much improved for
these banquets: the vegetables still taste like sog-
gy paper and the meat still varies in color from
grey to green. Only the prices are anyfancier!

Take away the franchise from Saga? But then
what is the guarantee that the next hash slinger
will not be even worse? Besides, this would be
hitting at the very root of the Americanway of
life—'-free enterprise and monopoly! No, the only
thing for the students to do is keep a bottle of

_ Pepto-Bismol handy; and if once in a while Saga

slips up even worse, and there is food poisoning,
there is always the handy student health service,

Disappoints

. _
Coach Lewis
By MARV ZELKOWITZ

Andy Alex, junior pitcher»
on the baseball team, was as
disappointing this season to
Coach Bobby Lewis, as Edsel
was to theiFord Motor Com-
pany.

Alex, who was a regular starter '

two years ago, pitched only ﬁve
innings this
year, and had ;
no decisions. A
“I’m ' _n o t sure 3
w h a t w a s ,
w r o n g" with E
him,” Lewis E
said. “His mind 5
wasn’t on base-

ball.” ’

A 1 e x was
Darticu- 
larly disappointing in his start
against Fort Belvoir, lasting only
two innings plus. The cluds were
‘thick around Alex’s head in that
game, _also. He stretched with no
one on base, and took a full wind-
up: with a man on ﬁrst.

Alex lost interest in baseball
that game, according to
Lewis. “He didn’t come up to
practice much after, that,” Lewis
said. “Then, when he did come
up, he was very quiet and re-
served. He didn’t joke With the
fellows very much, “either.”

Alex’s manner of dressing earn-
ed him the nickname "‘Pigpen.”

B One ballplayer said that Alex’s

dress was even detrimental to the
morale of the team. “It’s depres-
sing to see a pitcher go out to the
mound with his hat tilted to one
side and his shirt hanging outi It
takes some of my conﬁdence
away.” A

Despite his poor showing this
year, Lewis is counting on Alex to
be a starter next year. “Andy has
a lot of work to do before he be-
comes a starter again. As of now,
he’ll have to be a starter.

Of course, I’m more worried
about his grades than his base-
ball playing. His studies are more
important thangplaying ball. He’s
here to learn, not to pay base-
ball.‘-Andy won't play, no matter
how good he is, if he isn’t
eligible.” '

all but a few of the team’s 30

points in the discus, as was John-

Bailey for the 30 points accumu-
lated in the two and three mile
runs.

Bil DelVecchio was responsible
for most of the 29 points scored in
the 220-yard dash and the 22
points won in the 100-yard dash.

The team was able to score only
eight of a possible 56 points inithe

ha1f—mile and 13 out of 56 points
in the mile — two events they
have been consistently weak in.

Baseball‘ Team
Loses Two Hitters‘

Next year’s e d it i o n of the

Panther baseball team will not‘

be as successful as this one, ac-
cording to .Coach Bobby Lewis.
“You can’t lose two .400 plus hit-
ters and a pitcher like (John)
Car1isle_and be as good.

“_It’s going to be tough to ﬁnd
a replacement for (Al) Ricciuti
at shortstop. You don’t often come
up with .400 hitters.” Ricciutti,
who was the all-District II short-
stop, batted over .420 and hit four
home runs and had, 20 runs batted
in. ' .

‘Corky Cuthbert, Lewis’s other
.400 hitter, also graduates this
year. The right ﬁelder collected
29 hits in 59 at bats during the
regular season for a .477 av-
erage.

John Carlisle is the best pitcher ' ‘L
Lewis said.

I’ve ever coached,”
“He has great stuff, and a lot of
poise out there.”

Despite his losses, however,
Lewis still has three regulars re-
turning to the lineup next year,
in addition to pitchers. Fred Ma-
zurek, Paul Martha, and Brian
Fisher‘ are among the returning
regulars.

« ‘Awareness Isn’t   Enough’

policies. It is both_the student's
right and responsibility to know
the “why” behind controversial
policies.

By NANCY DELANEY

To break down not only the class system, but also the caste system in America, em-
ploy a process of vertical integration, as suggested by W. Lloyd Warren, author of Ameri-

can Life, Dream and Reality, urged Joan Robinson, Northern Students’ Movement from .

Vassar at the Student Union Forum last Wednesday.
NSM was recently instrumental in the formation of the Hill Education Project (HEP)

the Negro students to ﬁnish high6

school and be able to move into
higher economic and social
classes which are now primarily
the domain of only whites.

In conjunction with the HEP,
the newly organized “Pitt Vol-
unteers’ Association,” headed by
Thomas Mellers, will be tutoring
students in the Hill District. At

1 the Forum, the cabinet for the
association pleaded, “The young
people of this community have

' only one means of advancement

 . -—education. You have that. Give
0 some of it to them.”

“Exclusion and Discrimination”
_ Goldia Dargan, guidance spec-
ialist of the Urban League of

: Pittsburgh, speaking at the For-

um, directly attributed ’the gap
separating the Negro from the

Z ’ white citizen to “long-term eco-

, nomic deprivation” and “exclu-
sion and discrimination.”

Quoting high school dropout
rates and low income ﬁgures
of Negroes as compared to
whites, she remarked, “With
the type of situation I have
just described continuing, the
future can’t be any prettier

.than the past.”

Mrs. Katherine Pinneo, one of
four faculty members of the
eleven-member cabinet, "said “In
the light of such deprivation,
disparity, and neglect, anger and
urgency assail me.”

Time for Action

“Miss Dargan has made us

aware of the facts,” she exhort-
- ed, “but awareness isn’t enough!
Now is the time for action.”

In answer to the direct
question, “Will the Pitt Vol-
unteers be a civil rights or-
ganization?” Mrs. Pinneo sup-
ported the comment of Michael
Kalisher, that any civil rights
demonstrations would be com-
pletely voluntary.

“The association at present is
being organized to aid in educa-
tion. It will develop into what-
ever the members wish to make
of it,” Kalisher answered.

Vociferousness Urged

The members were urged,
however, to make of it a vocif-
erous agency for civil rights by
Michelle Patterson, a student at
Sarah Lawrence College and a
member of the Northern Stu-
dents‘ Movement.

“There are,” according to
Miss Patterson, “a number of
integration laws that should
be enforced—but aren’t.” She’
suggested tutor-student parties
at area swimming pools and
restaurants that practice dis-

crimination in order to test
the issue.
Another project she recom-

negroes can practice selective
patronage by doing business only
with establishments that employ
negroes.
Attempts a Change
“Perhaps the group could also
«attempt a behavior change on
the University’s administrators,”
remarked James Perrin of Har-
vard’s Phillip Brooks’ House.
“The University of Pittsburgh,”
he a d d e d condescendingly,
“could be a powerful agent for

explained by Miss Robinson,
and Mrs s Patterson, who
claimed that _only by a com-
munity project such as this can
Black Muslin movements be
avoided._ , ,
“We can’t avoid this program,”
according to Robert Woodruff of

the Pittsburgh Board of Educa-
tion"s Team Teaching Project.
‘.‘We’ve got to ﬁght this battle-
if we don’t win the battle, we
are going to lose» the war.”

Commenting on compromise,
he added, “Never, since I have
been at Pitt, have I had to say,
‘This policy is wrong —— ser-
iously wrong — but I'll have
to go along with it to keep
from upsetting the boat.” _
Questioned. about his feelings
concerning the policies of the
Dean of Students’ Ofﬁce, how-
ever, Whalen commented, “This
is a problem it is impossible to
speak frankly on. But you’ve got
toiremember,” he concluded, quot-
ing Harry Truman, “If you’re go-

prepared to take the heat.”'
