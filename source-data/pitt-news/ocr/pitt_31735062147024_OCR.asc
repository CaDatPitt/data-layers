Senior Ball Friday Night

Made ‘Summer Formal’

 

Book Merle Jacobs’ Band
To Play From 10 To 2
At Schenley Hotel

 

By Charles B. Holstein

The Senior Ball committee has
crashed through an act that should
prove a great boon to mankind this
week. The sorry chance of a few
hundred men suffering the discom-
forts of conﬁning tuxedoes and damp,
wilted, stiff shirts during these [May
days has been guarded against by a
vote of the committee to make -the
affair this Friday night “Summer
Formal.”

Announcement also comes from the
committee that,Merle Jacobs’ broad-
casting orchestra of Cleveland has
been signed to play for the four hours
of dancing at the Schenley hotel ball-
room. Jacobs is at present booked.
at the Hotel Holleiiden in Cleveland
and has played long term engage-
ments at the Lotus Gardens and
Golden Pheasant night clubs in the
Ohio city.

Tickets for the dance, ‘,‘The ‘Sea-
son's Finale,” as the committee . puts
it, will be on sale all week with mem-
bers of the committee, in 801_‘_Cath‘e-
dral of Learning, and with William
Dauffenbach ﬁll Alumni hall. In “line
with the pol'icy established by last
year’s Senior ball to put the affair in
the "low price ﬁeld,” the assessment
this year is only $3 per couple.

Miss Kathryn Keown of Pittsburgh, ‘

a‘ graduate of Perry High school with
the class of 1930, has ‘been invited by
Howard A. Kleeb, BA, chairman of
the ball, to act as Queen of the af-
fair. Any plans as to a grand march
have not as yet been disclosed. The
dance begins at 10 o’clock and will
end at 2.

Recently the committee inserted a
ballot in the News, asking students to
vote for one of three bands under con-
sideration. Kleeb has submitted a
statement to the News, explaining the
fact that Jacobs’ band, though not on
the ballot, was ﬁnally chosen. His
statement follows:

"At the time the ballot was run,
all three bands named, Freddie Mar-
tin, Little Jack Little and Isham Jones
were all available. The majority vote
of the students favored Martin, and
we immediately took steps to contract
him-through a Pittsburgh -hooker, We
considered the matter settled, but just
recently we learned that only an oral
contract had been made. When we

tried to obtain a written contract, it-

was refused us. Last minute attempts

to procure either of the other "two-

bands were unsuccessful. l't_w‘a”s then
that we discovered that Jacobs was
available, and we c‘o'n’si'dei' ‘oii_'rs'elve_s
very fortunate to s’e‘cur‘e' atthis date
a band of the "calibre of this ‘one.
Please understand that Jacobs i_s no
plug band, and _t;lio”u_’g‘li his Pittsburgh
reputation is not as great as those
of the other ‘three, he has a really
ﬁne orchestra, which has made a
great name for itself further West."

W. R. Grove Speaks

The controversy between the social
worker and the psychologist in penal
institution work was explained by W.
R. Grove, assistant psychologist of
Vvestern Pennsylvania penitentiary,
in an address before the Psychology
forum last Monday.

Mr. Grove told of the frequent over-
lapping of work and the rivalry be-
tween the psychologist and the social
worker, which results in an animosity
between, the two. Since the line of
demarcation betweenthe functions of
these workers inside the prison is
not clearly marked, there is often a
duplication of case-record work.

Supply And Demand

American college graduates who
will be unemployed this June can
take a variety of cold comfort in
their diplomas when they read the

recent ukase of the German Min-
istry of the Interior limiting the num-
ber of students who may be admitted
to German universities next fall. In
place of the 40,000 candidates who
have passed matricula.tion examina-
tions, only 15,000 are to be admitted in
the coming year. By a characteristic
touch, not‘ more than one-tenth of that
number may be women.

Further reductions are to be made
if necessary in future years. and the
supply of blighted matriculation can-
didates is to be painlessly curtailed by
reducing the number of secondary-

school pupils who will be allowed to *

ﬁnish their courses. German educa-
tional retrenchment will, however,
"select” the highest talent for inten-

sive training. The qualiﬁcations for -

this education are to be intellectual
and physical ﬁtness, character, and
“national reliability.”
not a professed Hitlerite need apply.

The Nazi attempt to ﬁt supply to ‘

demand in this ﬁeld will ‘be regarded
as ‘-‘an innovation in economic plan-
ning; yet it is a most obvious measure
in- the face of a breadless army of
graduates who are unable to earn a
living in a country overstocked with
doctors and lawyers and bond sales-
men. The oﬂicial statement points
out that all the professions are over-
crowded, and that the number of uni-
versity students has risen from 62,900
in 1911 to 123,000 in 1931. Of the sec-
ond number, 19,700 were women. The
intention ofthe German ministry, of
course, is to divert the would-be pro-
fessional men and officials into occu-
pations where there is: “more room"
for them: into industry and agricul-
ture, and perhaps into revivals of the
old, Empire colonial projects, when
and if.

' Unemployment among graduates in
the United States is not so character-
istic as in Germany, since we seem to
have avoided the deeper constrictions
of German economic life; yet the ten-
dency is to re-examine our educational
system. That examination should be
in terms of an alternative to the Nazi
regimentation of youthlout of the uni-
versity.

Others Say:

 

 

Since a car manufacturer intro-
duced no-draft ventilation a new wave
of car-buying has taken place. Every
henpecked husband in the country
‘bought one and claims that even when
his wife is talking there is no draft,
which is saying a lot for any car.

But the industry has introduced
another gadget that, from its adver-
tising, makes the self-starter look like
just another gag to save on gas. It
is a car with knees! That in itself
is an accomplishment But, as every-
one has observed, all knees are not
alike; in fact, one might go so far
as to say that some knees are better
than others. There is terriﬁc compe-
tition in the motor industry.‘ It would
not surprise us in the least to see
some company out tomorrow with this
S10gan: “Buy car with knees like
Marlene Dietrich,” and the next day
see a rival company advertise: “See
the 1934 model with the Mae West
chassis!”

How will style trends affect the mo-
tor industry? Naturaly when the long
dress that covers the knee is popu-
lar, fenders will have to come down
proportionately. If fashion demands
the briefer costume, the modern auto
will have to purr around looking like
Sally Rand without her fans.

Now that motor cars have knees.
the entire ﬁeld of automobile repair-
ing must be changed. Instead of con-
tracting old-fashioned ailments like
‘broken—axle and burnt-out spark plugs,
the gas buggy doctors will be treat-
ing their patients for water on the
knee and fallen arches. I think this
automoibile improvement thing has
gone far enough. Pretty soon the
coeds will be demanding elimination
of the clutch in the car . . . calamity.

Dean Amos Presents

Dedication Song
For Cathedral

Warm yellow glow of tall candles’
ﬂame; white arms gleaming 511-
houetted; and a pure white spot-
light outlining every feature of a pic-
ture of the Cathedral of Learning
hanging far above the heads of the
stage ﬁgures—this was the effective
background of the debut of “Fair
Tower of Pittsburgh,” the Cathedral's
own dedication song, at the Women’s
Glee club annual formal home con-
cert in Carnegie Music hall last Thurs-
day evening.

The song was presented as a sur-
prise feature. Its lyrics were written
by Dean Thyrsa W. Amos, and were
adapted to the musical score of “The
Green Cathedral,” by Carl Hahn, for
the use of which the University has
been granted permission by the John
Church Publishing company.

Georgia Orwig, prominent Pitts-
burgh pianist, and active in the glee
club and as a member of Delta Delta
Delta, social fraternity when a stu-
dent at the University in 1928-1929,
was very well received as guest pian-
ist. ' P '

William Meyers sang as guest tenor
soloist.

The glee club offered its regular
repertoire, featuring the sextette, the
quartet, a duet, and several solos.

Mrs. Robert D, Ayars, is the direc-
tor of the club; Jean Howard, Ed34,
president; and Lucille Hamilton, ac-
companist.

The word of “Fair Tower of Pittsburgh" are
as follows:

(1) Fair tower of Pittsburgh rising

From earth green as the May,
Thy stately form,

Thy comely form,

In beauty caught in clay.

In thy great halls of learning,
Graced by all nations’ arts;
By noble word,

By kindred act, -

Is good infused in hearts.

When through thy. lofty-«arches
Youth looked beyond their ken,
Here they discern,

Here all discern:

In truth betrothed to man.

( 2.)

(3)

Fair tower of Pittsburgh rising,
Lift high my soul with thee,

That the good, the true, the beautiful
May be caught alike in me

Jimmy Nelson Pinch Hitting

rhe Football Clinic

Eddie Casey, Harvard coach, and Lou Little, head football coach at C0-
lumbia, had nothing but praise for the entire Pitt coaching staff. The man-
ner in which the young coaches went to work and solved the high ‘school
coaches’ problems was amazing, and that coming from football notables ‘such
as Casey and Little is a real compliment.
L

O C O

Demonstrations
Practically everyone attending the
clinic agreed with Dr. Sutherland that
“exhibition and demonstration” is the
best method of conducting a clinic.
The speakers, Paul Jenkins, Casey,
Little, and Dr. Sutherland also had
a great deal to do with putting the
clinic across.
t- i
There was plenty of variety on the
speaking program: Jenkins dis-
cussed, “High School Problems,” in a
southern drawl; a Harvard accent
went along with Eddie Casey’s dis-
cussion of “Forward Passing;” and
Lou Little spoke like a typical ‘N’
Yawka, discussing _ “Deception.”
I 0 8
Casey used as an example to illus-
trate the value of theforward pass,
his team’s (Harvard)! 19 to 6 victory
over Yale last year. He admitted to
a greatly peeved Yale rooterthat the
Bulldogs did make more ﬁrst downs,
gain more ground, out-charge, etc.
But Casey had to remind the Yale-
man that touchdowns decided the win-

3

per and not ﬁrst downs. The Harvard .

team ‘completed three forward passes
which led to two touchdowns, which
were the margin of victory. ‘ 
o ‘t

You would have thought that the
Columbia-Stanford games was only a
few minutes old if you heard Lou Lit-
tle’s description of the scoring. play
that won the game, for Columbia,
Although Barabas, Columbia left half
scored the touchdown, Little: claims
that the part played by McDowell,
Lion left end, was an important fac-
tor in the play. McDowell paved the
way for the touchdown by giving
Barabas some perfect interference.
