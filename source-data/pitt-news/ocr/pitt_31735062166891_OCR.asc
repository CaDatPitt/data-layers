ARMANI) BELLY
Looks for Abolition Mandate

Belly Repeats
Abolition Call

“One of the real causes of
apathy is Student Government
(SG),” declared Armand Belly,
independent SG presidential can-

0 pdidate, as he reiterated his call

for the abolition of SG. He made
the remark yesterday to a late
night WP-GH audience.

“If a person really feels strong-
ly about an issue, he must now
go to an SG senator who may
then take it to a debate in the
Senate,” said Belly. “In that
case, the issue is removed from
the area of most concern. So,
nothing gets done. Under my al-
ternative, nothing would prevent
a student from going out on his
own to get support for what he
ﬁeels is irnportan ."

Belly’s alternative to SG, as
outlined in a platform released
only yesterday, would distribute
functions of SG to other organ-
izaltions. Homecoming, Winter
Weekend, -and Parents Weekend,
notes the platform, can be taken
care of by the Student Union
Board. The Student Directory,
says Belly, should be under the
Office of Student Pulbl-icaltion-s.
He calls tor selection of the Al-
locati-ons Committee by a com-
mittee composed of the chair-
men of the school cabinets and
the General Assembly.

By making the school cabinets
the primary .institutions for the
setting of educational policy,
Belly hopes “the major focus
of the leading student organiza-
tions will be upon education and
not petty politics.”

Belly explained that if elected
to oifice, he would act quickly
to implement his alternative. “I
would like to have a speedy ref-
erendum. I think the alterna-
tives are clear now."

He said he did not expect the
newlyelected Senate to refuse
to go along with his proposal.
because, “If I am elected, it
will be a mandate from the stu-
dents to get rid of SG.”

GEORGE DOPERAK
Stands Behind Platform

Doperak To File
Complaint Tonite

United Student Association
(USA) Presidential Candidate
George Dopenak conﬁrmed last
night on a WPGH interview that
he will present evidence sup-
rportting his charge yesterday
that the Student Government
Elections Committee (SGEC) “'is
not now nor ever was during
«the campaign a neutral organ-
izatvion.”

He will present this evidence
to the SGEC in a meeting of
the committee tonight. Wh-en
‘tasked to elaborate on his charge
by one of the radio listeners,
Doperak said he preferre-.d to
keep his information private un-
til the committee meets.

Speaking ﬁrst on the twolhour
program that presented each
presidential candidate separate
ly, Doperak insisted, “We want
to stand behind our platform. It
is ridiculous at this time to say
we promise an across the board
discount in the book store or an
improved in-state out - of -state
ratio, so why even include it in
the platform."

KEN SCHUELER
Says “Fortitude” Needed

Sense of Values.

Needed-Schueler

Ken Schueler, rpresidential can-
didate for the Postive Action
Team (PAT), admitted last night
that the point of his opponent
Armand Belly concerning favor-
itism in Student Government
(SG) appointments is “well
taken.” 'I‘.h~ivs, said Schueler, is
Belly’-s main point, but it does
not justify the destruction of
SG.

“SG must emphasize, as we
have said over and over, a sense
of values in the student leader-
ship,” he explained. To av-oid ap-
pointment because of political
friends-hip, Schueler said the
leaders must have a sense of
personal fortitude. He maintain-
ed, “I am coming into SG with
no cornrnittm-ent-s to anyone.”

Schueler repeated his meth-
od for dealing with the admin-
istration and admitted that, if
necessary, he would avocate stu-
dent demonstration-s. This, he
emphasized, is only the last re-
sort in a long line of bargining
steps. “We assume,” he said,
“that the administration is ra-

Secret Research, NSA
ROTC, & Vietnam War

Unlike previous Student Government (SG) elections,
this year's ballot will feature four referendum questions
calling for student opinion on the feasibility of joining
the National Student Association (NSA), the War in Viet-
nam, University involvement in secret research, and the
status of the Reserved Officers Training Corps (ROTC)

program.

The questions do not simply ask whether or not one likes the
Vietnam war. Instead they provide a wide range of alternatives.

The intent of the NSA question for instance, is to poll student
opinion regarding SG membership in NSA. NSA performs many
services to over 300 member Student Governments. They have, for
example, a Student Government Information Service which is an
information guide used to counsel a particular SG facing a. new

problem on campus.

On the other -hand, NSA has taken a. number of stands con- _

cerning national issues.

The second question on the ballot relates to the war in Viet-
nam. Here the student can advocate the invasion of North Vietnam,
the present policy, the cessation of the bombing, or the uncondi-

tional withdrawal of US troops.

The secret research question will reveal student opinion on this
«recent controversy at the University. The student who chooses to
vote can support secret research, reject secret research, or leave
secret research to the discretion of the 

MDC Offers
Last Forum

Students will have their last
chance to view the three candi-
dates for Student Government
president tonight at 8 when
Men's Dormitory Council pre-
sents a forum with the candi-
dates in the lobby of Tower A.

The election for so ornces
will be tomorrow from 9:30 am.
to 7 p.m. in the SU Ballroom,
Engineering Hall and Scaife
Hall. Students -should have both
validated current ID card and
invoice. Undergraduates may
vote for senatorial candidates
from their respective schools
and for president. Grad-usate stu-
dents rnay vote for president
and vice--president only. For fur-
ther details, see page 9.

The dilemma of secret re-
search was sparked by debate
in the University's Faculty Sen-
ate. This issue had such an im-
pact that it was covered by some
city newspapers and .by the col-
legiate press service.

The ﬁnal question points to
the University ROTC program.
‘Students can advocate the aboli-
-tion of ROTC, an elective stat-
us for ROTC, or mandatory
ROTC.

This referendum was imple-
mented this year to enable SC
to take an accurate sampling
opinion regarding areas of cam-
npus controversy. It will also
provide Student Government
with the facts and ﬁgurw neces-
sary to inform student leaders
as to the overriding sentiments
on campus. Consequently, fu-
ture leaders of Student Govern-
ment will know wfhlalt programs
can be pursued with student
support.

‘Pitt News’ Review

 

Movie Satirizes World War II

by PAUL ANDERSON

How I Won the War is the
tale of a blundering British
officer, his motley troop of
weekend warriors and how
they §‘won” World War II
for England and their
mothers. The very idea is, of
course, ridiculous and so the
movie is really a cockneyed dec-
laraition of war against the pop-
ular conception that battle is
a sharing your last cigare+tte~—
dying in your buddy’s arms lcind
of experience. ‘

War, says Richard Lester, the
director, is a bloody bad time.

No matter what the recruiting I

posters tell us there’s no glory
in today’s action army; just
pain, blood and anonymous
death. There has to be an easi-
er way to see the world.

In his movie, Lestires satir-
izes the British officer class by
turning them in-to clumsy inef-
ficient idiots. Michael Crawford
pl-ays ht. Ernest Goodbody, a
little boy prep of a commander
whose incompetence an-d “Iwiant
-to take t-hi.s opportunity” pep
talks instill fear in the hearts
of his men. He's the kind of
-guy who always picks the mo-

tional and that if we are backed
‘by enough investigation and doc-
umentation, earlier steps in bar-
-gaining would be effective.”

Schueler remarked that total
student interest isn't demanded
by SG. But he did say that some
of the investigation done by SG
would have to done outside the
executive and that more people
would have to become involved.
“N o matter how interested the

things alone,” said lSchueler.

Commenting on Belly’-s recent-
ly released plaitfoirm, échu-eler
identiﬁed two probllems with it.
He contended that I Belly had
still not answered how commit-

Doperak Asserts
Senate Stature

(Continued from Page 1)

The USA candidate also as-
serted, “I am against the po-
litical machine on campus. I
think appointments should be
made on the basis of applica-
tion and qualiﬁcation.” He did
not feel, however, that perma-
nent political parties, called for
in the USA iplatform, would act
to split Student Govermnent
(SG).

Doperak, ‘an incumbent SG «sen-
ator, maintained that the Sen-
ate should be the most power-
fllll part of SG. “Only a few sen-
ators in the last year made a
real contribution,” he said.
“What was missing was a spir-
it, and perhaps the Senate felt
overpowered by t:he executive,
which is not to say that the
executive didn’t do a good job.”
Doperak pledged to increase
Senate participation, if elected.

a heart ’o pure gold.

The ﬁlm has a sort of a mad-
cap Sgt.
tude towards war and, although
rife with slapstick, nowihere
doe-s it get to=o sticky. Orawford
gets punched in the snoot, buried
head ﬁrst in sand and dunked
in the Atlantic (usually wrhile
giving one of his training man-
ual speeches about the necessity
of having cleaned and powder-
ed feet) but it’s all in the inter-

ests of spook; just good "clean ‘

anti-war fun..

But there’s more to this ﬁllm’s
humor than the physical. A few
examples: Nazi officer, about his
genocidal tendenies, to Craw-
ford, his prisoner, “l’m blame-
less. We’re all artists here, you
know.” Sa.me officer after he
has just gotten ﬁnished extoll-
ing the German s-oldiier for his
honesty and d-isoipline in front
of Crawford and a line of them
ﬁle by carrying plunder, to the
soldiers: “You're going to have
to put all that back.” Command-
ing officer to subordinate, “Keep
-them busy so they don't have

time for dirty things” or “You’ve“

been taking too many unwound-
ed prisoners.”

All kidding aside, Lester's mo-
vie has its share of blood and
gore. Even that is showed in a.
grotesquely humoresque way. A
man lies in a ditch, his legs
bloodied stumps when his sweet-
heart mysteriously appears on
the battleﬁeld. “It hurts,” he
moans. “Run. them under the

. cold tap, luv,” she advises. A fat

British soldier is disarmed by -a
eGrman and cornered. “Ah, have
a hea ,” he pleads just before
he is bayoneted in the chest.

Lester set out to ﬁlm “‘-the

-anti-wair movie to end anti-war“

movies” and, despite the over-

statement an-dthe clutter he has

succeeded.

New Dylan AlbumCombines

Folk Style, Complex Imagery

by JOE ANDERSON

In case you haven’t heard,
Bob Dylan is back among
the living. After 18 months
of convalescence he's a bit
thinner, a year and a half
older, one beard the wiser
and 12 songs the better. John
Wesley Harding is his new al-
bum. It announces the appear-

ance of a new and different Dy-
lan.

In John Wesley Harding, Dy-
lan combines the folk music
style of his early records with
the complex imagery of Blonde
on Blonde and Highway 61.
Though Dylan’-s lyrics are us-
usally so esoteric that they make
interpretation difficult the folk
style is ﬂexible en-ough to al-
low for easy listening.

I Believe I Saw St. Augustine
and The Ballad of Frankie Lee
and Judas Priest are perhaps
the best songs of the allbum.
Augustine -traces the reappear-
ance of St. Auugustine who comes
searching for “the very souls
whom already have been sold.”

Augustine travels about entreat-
ing all to listen to his words.
He tells them there are no more
martyrs today that people can
call their own. Augustine has
returned to offer himself to the
peoplle so that they will not feel
so alone. "

But the people (Dylan among
them) rise up and kill St. Aug-
ustine. Later Dylan experiences
a terrible loneliness and hangs;
his head and cries. This is un-
doubtedly the most important
song Dylan has ever written. It
is also the first time that he
has carried a religious theme
throughout an entire piece.

The Ballad of Frankie Lee
and Judas Priest also has strong

.religivou.s overtones. Frankie «and

J u» as are two friends. One day
Frankie comes to Judas asking
for money. With-ouat hesitating
Judas takes out all his money
and places it before Frankie
telling him to take Whlalt he
needs. Then J ud-as goes off down
the road looking for eternity,
leaving Frankie alone.

But before he can choose,
Frankie is called away to res-

cue Judas who delayed on his

Way to paradise in a house of ,

p-rostitu.tion. Upon seeing the
«house, Frankie forgets about °
Judas and rushes inside tomiake
his “midnight creep.” Aﬁter 16'
days of creeping, Franlktie dies
from exhaustion in the arms of
Judas. “The moral of this song,”
sayvs Dylan. “is don’t go mis-
-taking paradise for that home

Needing big solutions. Better ideas. And that's where you
come in. Because it all adds up to a real opportunity for young
engineering graduates like yourself at Ford Motor Company.

Come to work for us and you'll be a member of a select
College Graduate Program. As a member of this program,
you won't be just another "trainee" playing around with
“make work" assignments.

You'll handle important projects that you'll frequently

follow from concept to production. Projects vital to Ford.
And you'll bear a heavy degree of responsibility for their
success. -
You may handle as many as 3 different assignments in
your first two years. Tackle diverse problems. Like ﬁguring
how high a lobe on a cam should be in order to yield a certain
compression ratio. How to stop cab vibration in semirtrailer
trucks. How to control exhaust emmission.

Soon you'll start thinking like a giant. You’ll grow bigger
because you've got more going for you.

Special programs. Diverse meaningful assignments. Full
responsibility. The opportunity to follow through. The best
facilities. The funds to do a job right. No wonder 87% of the
engineers who start with Ford are here 19 years later.

If you're an engineerwith betterideas, and you'd like
to do your engineering with the top men in the ﬁeld, see the

The Spock Case

Senators to

The charge is usually made in political campaigns that the voters
are offered alternatives that represent no real choice. This is definitely
- not applicable this year; for once, we do have a choice. Those students
casting their vote for Armand Belly will be voting in effect to abolish
Student Government (SG). There is only one real flaw - there is no
guarantee that even if elected, he can insure that SG will be abolished.

Students must remember that Belly has no commitment from
senators that it they are elected (and as he has no slate, none of them
are committe_d to him) they will support him i:n his drive to abolish SG.
Belly states that his victory will be a mandate from the students to
abolish SG and that if the senators fail to comply, he’ll hold up every-
thing until they have no recourse but to concede.
.is committed to the end to wreck the entire structure of SG and he’ll
, stop at nothing to accomplish his goal.

‘The novelty of his campaign has a definite appeal to the dissatis-
fied elements on our campus. We now ask them to think past the turm-
oil of the campaign and into the year ahead. We ask them to carefully
scrutinize Belly’s platform, which only provides for the more routine
functions of SG, such as the management of Homecoming, Parents’
Weekend, etc. We ask them if they are not voting f'or an alternative

inadequate platform that makes no provision for supporting the causes
essential to our student body —— such as rallying for a new Student
Union or a ten per cent across-the-board discount in the Book Center.

There are students who are fighting to renew SG. We’d like to
offer the names of those senatorial candidates who have indicated
during this campaign that they have a real contribution to make to
SG. They are comprised both of members of both parties and of inde-
pendents. We pay no attention to labels when examining qualifications
and urge students to do likewise.

The candidates we recommend are: Phyllis Aaron, Lenny Baxt, Jef--
frey Casher, Nelson Cohen, Harriet Eisenberg, Terry Gordon, Dave Guydian,
Roy Jacbos, Edward Levine, Joe McCormick, Jack LaPietra, Mark Roth-
stein, Suzann Slyman, Joanne Telerico, Sofia Yank, and Edward Zetick.

Sacrifice For Change

by Ivan Abrams

Next Monday, a coalition
of Pittsburgh peace groups
will sponsor a demo;nstra-
tion at the Federal Build-
ing in protest of the arrest
of Dr. Benjamin Spock,
Rev. William Sloan Coff'in,
Mitbhéli Goodman; Michael

‘ Ferber, and Marcus Raskin.

These five men, all leaders
of the anti-war movement,
are accused, by the Govern-
ment, of conspiring to vio-
late the selective service
law.

Thefive men hope that
their trials will give them
the opportunity to test the
legitimacy of the draft and
the war in the courts. How-
ever, recent Supreme Court
actions have made it seem
unlikely that the Court will
care to involve itself in an
issue so close to the hearts
of the Johnson administra-

’ tion.

Obviously the powers-
that-be hope that the arrest
of these men will mean the
end of the anti-draft move-

ment, and perhaps of the
a,nti-war movement as well.
Yet once again, as is so typ-
ical of our “leaders,” they
have misinterpreted the sig-
nificance of their action.

Rather than stifling pro-
test, the arrests will serve
as a new rallying point for
the anti-war movement. The
war has suddenly been
brought closer to home with
the arrest of the mentor of
America;n mothers. But per-
haps even more important,
the leader of the movement
is in danger and this can-

' not help but serve to unite

the many diverse factions
towards a common goal.
This sort of unification is

not without precedent.‘

When, in the first decade
of‘ this century, Big Bill
Haywood, a leading member
of‘ the International Work-
ers o-f the World was arrest-
ed on trumped-up charges

cian, members of the work-

ing class, led by Eugene
Debs, rallied to his defense.
In spite of a campaign by
the business-controlled
press, Haywood was acquit-
ted. ’

But perhaps even more
important than the unifica-
tion of the anti-war move-
ment is the fact that draft
protests will not cease, but
will grow. The arrest of
Spock, et al, has shown re-
sponsible positions in soci-
ety, are willing to forego

those positions in order to

combat an evil war and a
totalitarian law that threat-
ens the future of this coun-
try. Whether or not the five
men are convicted, their ar-
rest and sacrifice has stim-
ulated others to follow their
example.

What do those who turn
in their draft cards hope to

accomplish. First, they are .

stating decisively that they
will no longer cooperate
with a system that robs
them of their individual li-
berties. Second, by refusing
to join the armed hordes of
the United States, they are
depriving the government
of the cannon fodder neces-
sary to continue the attack
on Southeast Asia. And
third, by making themselves
subject to arrest, they are
giving the same evidence ‘as
Dr. Spock of‘ the sacrifices
necessary to end the war
and change the course of
American society.
Pittsburgh has already
held one draft—refusal cere-
mony and will hold another
on or before April 3. Wheth-
er or not an individual turns
in his draft card is a per-
sonal matter, but the ex-
ample of five men has
shown the consequences,
and the importance, of such

 

   

feel these senatorial contenders can make significant strides toward
strengthening SG. L

We also want to take this opportunity to urge students to exer-
cise their option and cast a ballot at tomorrow’s election. This election
affects us more than many may realize. As students, we have a vested
interest in the organization designed to‘ manifest our beliefs. Let us
at the very least show that we care enough to take a side.

Letters to the Editor

Junior Questions

Belly Platform

Editor, The Pitt News:

After reading Armand Belly’s
stand (The Pitt News, Jan. 16),
it becomes quite evident that
Mr. Belly is an academic de-
bator. His statements sound very
much like a ﬁrst affimnat;ive
speech debating -the topic Re-
solved: Student Government at
the University of Pittsburgh
should be abolished. Along with
these lines then, a negative ar-
gument should be put forth.

The ﬁrst area of contention
rests with his deﬁnition of terms
i.e. what should be the function
of Student Government? I think
Mr. Belly has a narrow concep-
tion of the role of the Univer-
sity. Granted its academic func-
tion is one of its main elements,
it is unfair to the University to
say this is the only or primary
function. The University offers
much more than just an aca-
demic education. It is an educa-
'tion in human and social rela-
tionship." It is in a sense a way
of life. To many this function
and value equals the importance
of -the purely academic function.
It is regrettable that time wa.s
wasted in bickering over horne-
coming and jukeboxes. It is re-
grettable, however, in the sense
of the bickering, not in the sense
of the problems themselves as
Mr. Belly implies.

Moving on, the second area
derives from the ﬁrst. What is
the problem with Student Gov-
ernment? .Mr. Belly implies that
since the academic function is
the primary issue, the Student
Government's inefficiency re-sts
with its handling “unimportant"
issues -_ problems which they
have no business handling or
problems which could be han-
dled by another organization. I
think the unimportance of such
problems is only Mr. Belly’s
evaluation and it does not rep-
resent the evaluation of the ma-
jority of the -student body.

But, how does Mr. Belly pro-
pose to remedy the problem? He
will abolish Student Government
and route its functions to other
organizations or departments. If
the problem is as serious as Mr.
Belly implies, this could prove
to be a poor solution. He is
abolishing the main coordinat-
ing organization on campus and
at the same time burden-ing
other organizations and depart-

ments whose efficiency could

also be quest~i,oned poets, the

icall change? Wil-1 other organ-
izations handle the problems any
more efficiently? 'Ilhe answers
-to these questions raise serious
doubts concerning the proposal.
Mr. Belly. is not solving ineffi-
ciency, he is merely spreading
it around by further burdening
or overburdening other organ-
izations.

,_ There is a pro-b~1>em of Srtudent
Government inefficiency, b-ut Mr.
Belly’s analysis of its cause is
faulty. The inefficiency arises
from time lost in haggling over
issues, not from the introduc-
tion of these issues.

Or perhaps, Mr. Belly is sin-
cere, however, I can’t help but
think he is once again trying
to show his superior debating
ability-—what better way to try
to prove a side which seems to
have the deck stacked againsrt it.

Its Cr1t1c1sms
Editor, The Pitt News:

The USA will have to strug-
gle to win tomo-rnowls election
because of several unfortunate
circumstances. We are caught
between a party backed by the
ﬁrm political rnachine on cam-
pu-s (the in-power ARA and the
new PAT), and a pos.i*t.ior1 so
radical that people haven’t stop-
lped to realize that it cannot pos-
sibly wo-rk. (Abolition of SC} by
the executive without senatorial
consent is impossible.) We are
also misrepresented by “the
political machine. The Pitt News.

In -its cov-enage they listed
planks unde-r the PAT platform
which were not listed under
rours, even though our platform
was released four days earlier
with these original proposals.
PAT’s platform was also cred-
ited with having foresight into
the ten per cent bookstore re-
duotion, although this was an
accomplishment of the present
SG and is now under study.

The Pitt News praised the
fact that they also want to re-
evaluate the language require-
ment. But if they had investi-
gated this first, they would have
realized that it is already under
reconsideration. Nevertheless,
the uninformed reader still be-
lieves the mighty press. Per-
haps we were too idealist-ic in
believing in a clean campus elec-
tion.

Students Safe from Prosecution

Sociologists Study Drug Users

BURLINGTON, Vt. (CPS)
—University of Vermont so-
ciologists will study a group
of 50 students who say they
have used drugs.

And Vermont and Feder-
al law enforcement officials
have agreed to allow the
students to maintain their
anonymity and not to at-
tempt to prosecute them.
Even the researchers will
not know the names of the stu-
dents involved.

It is believed to be the ﬁrst
study of its kind in the nation
and the ﬁrst in which -l1aW en-
iiorcement officers have co-oper-
at-ed.

The main purpose of the study
is to obtain information on what
kind of students use drugs. The
research team, headed by Dr.

‘Ronald Steffenhagen of the uni-

versity’s sociology department,
will administer a. standard per-
sonality test to the drug users
as well as to a control group of
50 who say they have not ‘used
drugs. ‘

-But the researchers say the

and eventually stop using drugs
altogether.

the most irnportanlt aspect of
the study is introduction of
“-group therapy sessions” for
users. They say these sessions
have been made possible through
the co-operation of the law en_-
forcem-ent officials.

AWS CORRECTION
In order to be a. candidate
for sophomore representative
for Associated Women Stu-
dents (AWS), a freshnlan
woman must have at least 24
credits and not 31 as stated

in the Ja . 15 Pitt News.

The researchers plan to use
these sessions to provide infor-
mation which vvill keep students
from moving on to other drugs, ,
get them to decrease their use

“Saturday Review” Editor Reads
At International Poetry Forum

by DIANE McDONALD

Eight thirty in the evening,
January 17, 1968. Carnegie Hall.
Stilrlness. A silence broken only
by a rust-ling of programs in
nervous hands, a muffled cough,
the ﬁnal clicking shut of an
exit door. Lights are dimmed, a
microphone stands beside a
table on the stage.

Onto the stage strides a mlan,
tall, surveying the capacity
crowd through spectacled eyes.
J-ohn Ciardi, poe-try editor of the
Saturday Review, translator, lec-
turer, teacher, begins to read.
He explains his version of Da.n-
te’s “Divine Comedy,” inserting
“translation is the art of fail-
ure.”

Shifting to his own poetry.
Ciardi compares himself to Dan-
te, noting, “There is a slight
geological difference between
mountains and molehill.” John
Ciardi, the poet, begins to read.
After the ﬁrst wave of aPP1la=USe
recedes, he smiles slightly, and
bends over the microphone to
say, “I think protocol on these
occasions is that you save up
your applause for one tremen-
dous ovation.”

“Elegy Just in Case” was writ-
ten while he was stationed in
Saipan as he watched soldiers
composing elegies for dead
friends. (“I looked around, did-
n't see anyone I’d wanted to

write mine . . . so I wrote my
own.”)

Introdulci~ng “A Soldier Comes
H-ome in a Box,” Written in
1953, he conﬁdes that the Viet-
nam war also conjures up this
image of his country as a ﬂag-
wrapped coffin. A middle-aged
man shifts his weight deeper
into his chair, a sliver-haired
woman quietly smiles and slow-
ly nods her head.

Later, he declares, “I like

birds . . . I’ve never seen a stup-

id one,” and begins. a poem of
a mockingbird, heard one morn-
ing outside his window. He lis-
tens, knowing that its song car-
ries no profound message. Yet,
he links this “nothing” song
with life, admitting to us and to
himself, that “not to listen t0
this sung nothing is to be dead.”

The saved- up “tremendous
ovation” rises and breaks over
this tall man. He smiles and
nleaves the stage. Lights ﬂash on,
people ﬁle out of the hall. Car-
negie Hall. Jan. 17, 1968, 10 p.m.

SOME WEEKEND THOUGHTS

- Newslltem: Jerry Richey loafs to a 4:23 mile in Saturday’s
track meet, but tied a school record with a rather fast 52:13.3

‘ clocking in the 1000 yard run. Richey also ran a brisk quarter-

mile for the second leg of the freshman mile relay team.

. ‘Track coach Jim Banner stressed that Richey was
working on his speed, perhaps to stre.ngthen the f1n1sh1ng

it kick he’ll need when he faces Gerry Lindgren in the Invi-.

tational Meet at Madison Square Garden February 9th.

Richey will also get another shot at Villanova’s Mar-
tin Liquori in the two mile race. Liquori bested Richey in
the final hundred yards of the IC4A cross-country cham-
-» - pionships last November.

Although Banner feels
probably the two mile, he
will concentrate in this
Olympic year on the mile.
This week Richey figures to
be pressed by Penn State’s
Mike Shurko, who was the
second best high school dis-
tance runner in Pennsyl-
vania last year. Richey’s
time this Saturday should
be considerably better than
4:23.

Ban;ner estimates that
milers will have to run at
least 3:55 outdoors to qual-
ify for the U.S. Olympic

   

- team. Despite the f'act that Richey has not come close

to that mark as yet, Banner gives him a. good shot at it on
primarily two factors. One is that Richey has never been
really pushed, outside of that debatable finish in the
ilCilA’§. Alld the other is simply Banner’s confidence in
Richey’s ability. ‘ J
“It’s really tough to run against no competition,”
Banner has frequently pointed out this season. However
from here on, Richeyshould have all the competition he
can handle and then some.

News Item: Dace Garnett wins the freshman 60 yard dash
. in 6.5 seconds despite another poor start.

Garnett came from a poor high school track program
in Buffalo where he was never properly taught how to
start from blocks. Thus he has been left behind in two
consecutive races, only to win them by sheer speed. Gar-
nett could just as well start in a miler’s position for all
the advantage he gets from the blocks.

Banner’s efforts in correcti:ng Garnett have been
hampered by Garnett’s fear of false starting, which almost
disqualified him from his win at Navy. He may be devel-
oping a tendency to be extra-careful, which would negate
his inherent talent for speed. Garnett was timed in 6.0
in practice, and that’s only one—tenth of a second from
the world record. However, he may have jumped the gun
when he did it. .

Dave Hart, who watched Saturday’s meet with sev-

, eral football recruits at his side, offered a solution for

the powerful runner who figures to push for the tailback
spot in the fall. “Just let him carry a football,” smiled

O  Hart as Garnett flashed by.

News Item: Bryant Salter high jumps 6-3-1/2, considerably
below his leap of 6-8 last week. ‘

. Salter changed his track shoes between jumps in an
effort to provide himself with a more cushioned‘ fit. How-
ever, the new shoes couldn’t compensate for the physical
disadvantages of‘ the Field House’s high jump area.

News Item: John Egli resigns as Penn State basketball coach,
effective at the end of this season.

, State’s student newspaper, The Daily Collegian, had
severely criticized Egli ever since the end of last season.
The Collegian charged that dissension existed on the team
and asked for Egli’s dismissal, despite the fact that Penn
State went to the NCAA tournament two years ago.

h After the Lions had trounced the Panther basketball
team here last rweek, Egli excused himself from group of
reporters by saying, “Let me go and console Bob,” point-
mg to Panther coach Bob Timmons. The question now is:

 with the victor gone, what will happen to the loser?

Final news item: Houston upsets UCLA, 71-69, in. the game
of the century.

Track Team Loses, 60-39;
Large Crowd Watches Meet

by DAVE TIERNAN

“Individual stars and an
overall lack of depth” was
the forecast for the varsity
track team before the season.
The npred-iction held true Statur-
day when Kent State pulled out
a 60-39 victory at the Field
House. "

The lack of «a pole vaulter an.d
a two-mile relay team put the
striders down 13-0 before the
meet began, but the score was
not a fair indication of the after-
noon’s oonmpertiition, witnessed by
-“the bviggest crowd since Arnie
Sorwell u.sed to run,” «according
to a balding usher.

Greg Ellis led off the meet
with a ﬁrst place in the shot put.
His 51’10” heave was ﬁve feet
more than the nearest Kenrt toss-
er. However, Kent did pick up
second and third place in th
event. ‘

Kent’s Pittsburgh stars, Sam
Bair and Orin Richburg, dem-

onstrated the talent they ex-

hibited last year when they had
established Field House records
in the mile and the 60-yard
events, respectively. Although
they didn’t surpass those rec-
ords‘ Saturday, the two did pick
up first place ﬁnishes.

Paul Zink ﬁnished the mile
with his best time, 4:17, but he
was nowhere near Bair who
crossed the ﬁnish line in 4:08.8,
two seconds off of his effort last-
year.

Ghet Wojeiechowski led Rich-
burg for the ﬁnst 30 yards in
the 60-yard dash, but Richburg
ﬂa-shed by to take first in 6.4
seconds. Richburg, still hamper-
ed by a fO0t'b3.!l.l injury, was
rthree-ten~th’s of a second slower
than last yea-r’s record.

“I was worried about Wojcie-
chowski,” commented Richburg
after the race. Chet was fast
getting out of the blocks, but I
passed him. With an increase in
his leg work, he could be hard
to beat.”

Dave Brinn and Tom Ohristie
ﬁnished one-two in the 60 yard
hurdles, and a tlall by Carlos
Reisen early in the race elim-
.in-ated a possible sweep in the
event; the only one in which the
team has depth. Brinn’s win-
him time was is 8.  

     
   
  
          

Roger Holly ran the 1000 in
2:13.5; Jack N-eyer led the 600
in 1213.9; and John G-unsvon set
a new varsirty mark with a leap
of 22’3/1.” in the broad jum-p.

Other point-winners were Bob
McElheny, second in the high
jump; Zink, whose ﬁne ﬁnish in
the 1000 netted a third place;
and Ken Lawton, who ﬁnished
behind Bair and Tom Dowling
in the‘ two-mile run.

Coach Jim Banner, whose nec-

uord -‘breaking freshman team.

wo-n 84-11, appeared pleased with
the varsity’s effornts. However,
he did express d'l.'Sl3.lp'p0llI'lJtll'n£'Il't

not Clll‘S-ClOS!S€vd. Banner said team
captain Paull Greig was unable

He lost ground in his leg of
the race, and Reisen and Holly
vainly tried, to regain the lost
distance, but neither could over-
take the Kent runners.

“The men put out in their

relay. “We didn’t expect Kent
to be so good, -but it does re-

ﬂecut our lack of depth.” Holly,

r~—-The True Story

What They Are
Doesn’t Matter

George Lies
Associate Sports Editor

In the midst of Pittsburgh’s gay (SIC) wild night
life come several guys who, bursting in enthusiasm and
talent, have transformed Saturday afternoons at Fitz-
gerald Field House into the place where The Action can
befound.

“Des cuys do everything,” said a Brooklynite dis-
traught because he couldn’t find a New York night club
in downtown Pittsburgh.

A visiting professor from England said dryly, “I
say . . . it is amazing what they do.”

The superlatives flow,

building a new outlook and
a new legend. The Fresh-
men Track Team. They are
great, greater than, and the
greatest. .

But because they are
freshmen, they should not
be built to the poi'nt of Un-
beatable. Coach Jim Banner
feels this way. And he’s per-
fectly correct in the as-
sumption of big-headed--
ness. He won’t use superla-
tives; even when the fresh-
men‘ team wins 84-11, and
sets two school and five
frosh records.

Yet one must realize track
is the sport of the individ-
ual, requiring strict disci-
pline, grueling physical
exercise and maturity. A
talented track performer
cannot afford to slough-off
by getting lost in a crowd.

A freshmen track star,
if one foresees, can be pub-
licized without alienating
varsity members; in con-
trast, this i's not true of football players.

_ This year’s freshmen track team keeps sportswriters
going. The team is a winner, but of course its success is
partially due to Banner.‘

Banner has planted the seeds of a forest; one that
will continue to grow in the future. Over a thousand peo-
ple, the biggest crowd in 12 years, saw the track meet
Saturday and they can attest to that.

_ Naturally, success becomes expensive. The entire
Field House is headed for renovation; instead of the pock-
marked floor boards, a new track for roughly $30,000 will
be built. The track will be made of tartan, a similar sub-
stance makes-up the tennis courts.

The new track will be banked on the curves; this
means the jumping and shot-putting areas must be relo-
cated.

But athletes like Brian Salter, Jerry Richey, Mike
Nolan, Elliott Drysdale, Mark Vornhagen, Dave Garnett,
Mike Connell, Smitty Brown, J. D. Lewis, Jeff Snyder,
Wally Swiger, and Rudy Hufnagl will make the athletic
budget read in the black for a long time. _

In the coming weeks, Banner plans to give some of
them exposure in Baltimore and Philadelphia meets.
Those meets will be the primers for the IC4A’s in New
York and the NCAA’s in Detroit, and Banner in his quiet
manner would like to shake-up a lot of people.

‘I: ‘k * ‘k ‘I:

A SIGN OF THE TIME'S—What a shock it was for
Sports Information Director Dean Billick to see so many
people at the Field House. Billick had printed only 500
programs.

Banner also must have been just as shocked. In pre-
vious seasons, the track coach had trouble getting assist-
ants to keep times and just do the little things which need
to be done during the track meet. Saturday, however, Ban-
ner had more than his share of kibitzers.

As one fellow said, “Track buffs just try to get in on
everything.

ALTHOUGH THE frosh won every running event
Saturday, many times were slow. Richey, holder of the
school mile (4 :11.1) record, was never pushed as he regis-
tered a 4:23, crossing the finish line together with Vorn-

. hagen.

However, -lichey fashioned a prediction for the up-

Five Records Broken

   

Frosh Runners Win, 84-11; 

Bryant Salter had a little difficulty and Jerry Richey
had a problem, but what Kent State’s nationally known dis-
tanceman Sam Bair said summed it perfectly.

“If Pitt’s freshmen team would have run our varsity,” re-
marked Bair, “I think they would have beaten us.”

By ﬁnishing ﬁrst in every
event but -the shot put, while
establishing ﬁve frosh records
and equaling or bettering three
schooll marks, the freshmen
track team overwhelmed the
Kent frosh, 84-11, Saturday at
the Field House.

Bryant Salter had difficulty
with the approach in the high
jump, but his 6’3'/2” leap, which
was ﬁve inches short of his rec-
ord-breaking effort last week
against Navy, was more than
enough to win.

The problem of Jerry Rticrhey,
who also set a school record
against Navy with a 41:11.1 mile,
was that he had no cormpetition

in the mile. He paced teammate

Mark Vornhlagen -to a 4:23 ef-
fort, and the two runners cross-
ed the ﬁnish line together.

But later in the meet, Salter
and Richey aimed at two other
marks. With a leap of 22’1%” in
the broad jump», Salter set his
second school record. Rlic.hey’s
time of 2:13.3 in the 1000 yard
run tied the indoor vlansity time
set last year by Frank Handel-
man.

Jeff Snyder’s -13-foot vault was
good for a ﬁrst place and -a new
frosh record in the pole vault.
Snyder had tied the old frosh
record last week with a 12’6”
jump. Mike Nolan was the other
frosh record breaker by virtue

of his 9:37 effort in the two-mile
run. Greg Rodgers and Jeff Wil-
son chased Nolan across the
tape for a frosh sweep in the
event. _

The two-mile re-lay team of
John Crozier, Vorn-hua-gen, Rudy
Yaksick, and John Aiken ran in
8:14.2 to break the old freshman
record of 8:21 set in 1963. Kent
did not enter a team in the
event.

Dvave Ga-rnertt led three frosh
f-ootball players to a sweep in
the 60 yard dash. Mike C-onnell
and J. D. Lewis followed Gar-
ne-tt’s effort of 6.5 s-eoonrds.

Elliott Drysdale and Bill Pil-
conis ﬁnished one-two in the
hurdles, as did Smitty Brown
and Wally Sweiger in the 600
yard run. Drysdale’s time was
7.9; Brown’s was 11.4.

Rounding, out the sconin-g. was
the mile relay team of Drysdale,
Richey, Rudy Hufnvagl, and
Brown with pa 3:29.7 time; Huf-
nagl, regtisuteririg a second .in the
1000, and "Bart Duvla, with a
third in the shot put. Kent
sco-red eight of 11 points in the
shot.

In reachliang the school high
jump record last week, Salter
said he was then permitted only
one jump in the broad jump
against the Plebes. He did re-
ceive the alloted number Satur-
day and produced anoth-er school

Adams Hopes For Fans
Tomorro<wAfternoonAs

Grapplers Host Cornell

by ROY JACOBS
Wrestling fans get their first chance to see new head
coach Dave Adams and his first varsity team tomorrow at
the Field House. The grapplers host Cornell in a meet-that

starts at 3 p.m.

Adams is hope-full that a substantial number of fans turn out

to -watch his squad.

“It’s good to get home,” said Adams. “I think the kids are

glad to be here. I don’t know
how much difference it will
make though.

-“A nice crowd would help our
chances,” he continued, “but it
would have to be one Willing to
support us vocally.”

Field House audiences are
known to be police and respec-
ful, but far from vocall. For in-
stance, Lehigh holds its wrest-
ling meets in the Snake Pit, a
bandibox of a place where sev-
eral thou-sand fans crowd each
other for the privilege of inti-
midating Le-h.igh’s opponenits.

“Lehigh just has overly-en-
thusiastic wrestling fans,” ana-
ilyzed Adams. “If our people
wanted to be that way, we’d
welcome it. There’s no doubt
that athletes respond to enthusi-
-asm.”

Still, Adams’ problem now is
not Lehigh. The Engineers don’t
visit the Field House until Feb.
17. Most of his answers were
directed towards Cornell.

“It's going to take a real good
effort to beat them," forecas-ted
-the coach. “We're in the match
with them. I-t’s not like Navy
and Maryland, where we weren't
even in the meet. I’d say they
are about the same as Temple.”

The wrestlers lost to Temple,
21-14, but it was the kind of
match that could have gone ei-

 mer; way.i..1;aast-yes“ wt-Ithaca 

 

Most likely, some
I 1.11

the Big Red edged the varsity
18-12.

Cornell lost four seniors from
last year’s squad, but several
outstanding sophomers have ﬁll-
ed holes at 130, 145, and the 152
pound weight classes. Especially
of note is Ben Bishop at 145.
Against Navy -this year, he pin-
ned Eastern champ Pete Van-
derlofske.

Cornell hla'S already lost to Le-
high, Navy, and last Friday to
Penn State, 30-6.

However, the varsity isn’t in
top physical shape. Bruce Un-
anugst, the top sophomore, has a
bad knee and is a questionable
starter. Dave Johnson is recov-
ering from pneumonia, Lance
Manley from the ﬂu. Ron Schu-
chert is most likely out with a
shoulder injury, and Randy
Kahler is still not at full strength
after a bout with pneumonia.

On the brighter side, Adams
felt that “Jim Rhone probably
had his best week of practice
all year.” Despite all the in-
juries and setbacks, Adams re-
mains encouraged.

“The boys are working aw-
fullly hard,” he reﬂected. “This
might be the week we could up-
set some-body. Cornell is the fav-
orirte, but we could upset them.”

m-ark. However, the high jump.
gave him trounble.

“I couldn’t get my steps down
at all,” said Salter. But he add-
ed quickly, “I»"ll get them down
for next week though.” The lo-
cation of the high jump pit at
the Field House froces Salter to
omit three walking steps before
he starts his running app-roach.

Richey had comments on his
own problem. Kent didn’-t enter
a miler.

“I hate to ‘run against the
clock,” said the freshman rec-

ord-holder. “It was nice to run
at home, and I wanted to run

well for the local fans. I couldn’t V

in the mile, so I did it in the
1000,” he added.

Richey was referring to his
record-tying 2:1.3 time in the
1000, which was well-received by
the large crowd.

Sam Bair was a part of that
crowd. Bair, who is aiming at

the Olympics, was impressed 
with Richey’s abilities.  8‘

“He (Richey) is such a strong
runner,” :s'ai~d Bair, “He doesn't.

Submerges
Swimmers

The location was differ-
ent, but the story was the
same. A lack of depth add-

ed up to another defeat for the
varsity swimming team. The vic-
tor  time was Ohio Univer-

sity by a score of 7241.

“It was the old story,” said
juni-or swrimmer Richard Nor-
ris, “They completely outman
ned us.” The swimmers present-
ed their usual squad of eight
swimmers and two divers again-st

« Ohio's 25 swimmers and six div-

ers, and onceagain the merme-n
came out on the short end of
the score.

The team had entered the
meet with new enthusiasm and
optimism because of the appear-
ance of three new swimmers
during the past week. But these
swimmers did not compete in

‘the meet and the optimism end-
’ ed as the competition began.

After the ﬁrst four events, the
swimmers trailed by 24 points

-and for all practical purposes

the meet -was lost. “I had ﬁg-
ured a bad start because of their
extreme strength in the early
events,” said coach Bill Grant,
“but I didn’t expect their num-
ber two men to be so strong as
they were. We just couldn’t

2‘ catch up after our start.”

Grant had expected some sec-
ond place ﬁnishes in the early
events, but Ohio’s strength pre-
vented anything but a nominal
third place ﬁnish. Ohio started
right olf by taking the to-p spots
in the one meter d-iving. Chris
Newell, who later captured the
three-meter diving, impressed
Grant wi-th his performances.
“He’s a very good diver,” Grant
stated, “and the difference be
tween his performance and
Dean's (Coleman) was the very

 high degree of difficulty of his

dives, especially on the low
board-

The ﬁrst second place ﬁnish
by the swimmers was recorded
by John Lane in a very close
200-yard freestyle duel with
Ohio’-s sensational Dave Solo-
mon. Lane was nipped by Solo-
morn by nine-tenths of a second.
Grant said of the race, “I truth-
fully didn’t expect to see Solo-
mon in this one, but in the 1,-
000 yard instead .John gave him
a tremendous ﬁght in what was

' the best time I had seen all sea-

son.” Both Lane and Solo-mon
came back later in the meet to

" capture victories.

 Ohio, 72-41 Navy Hands Gymnasts

 

Sixth Loss Of Season

by CHUCK DWORAK
ANNAPOLIS, MD.—The gym team had a rough day
here Saturday. Navy unleashed its full artistic power in
bombing the gymnasts, 174.45—105.90.

“We knew they had better manpower than us,” commented
coach Warren Neiger. “I was hoping Bob Dodson or Dave Shide-

mantle could pick up a couple
of firsts in s-ome of the events,
-but Navy dominated the entire
meet.”

'Dhe Midshipmen ‘scored at
least 20 points in every event
except the trampoline, where
they scored a 19.50, and five
men had single scores of at
least 9.0.

For Navy, Craig Steidle grab-
bed a ﬁrst on the high bar with
a 9.2, and Bob Mackey kept his
perfect record on the longhorse
intact with a 9.2 Steve Klotz
was second on the longhorse
with 9.0, and Wayne Errickson
was second on the sidehorse
with a 9.0.

Jay Long, a Pittsburgh na-
tive, raised cheers from the
crowd when he swung around
-the sidehorse in near-perfect
fashion for a 9.5, t-he top per-
formance of the meet.

The Middies grabbed the ﬁrst
two spots in every event except
the parallel bars where Bob Dod-
son managed -a second with an
8.65.

“We have had many better
days,” said coach Neiger. “Shide-
mantle was off, and so was Tom
Fisher.” Fisher had trouble go-
ing into his L-formation on the
still rings. This apparently up-
set him for he scored only a 2.5
on the trampoline. Fisher nor-
mally scores a 7.0 performance
on the tramp.

Shidemantle decided to take
a second try on the longhorse.
(A performer may take a sec-
ond vault if he believes his ﬁrst
one was bad, but only the sec-
ond score counts.)

On his second effort, Sihide
mantle touched the outer white
stripe on the horse with his
hand for a one-point penalty.
He had to settle for an 8.3.

Freshmen Lowell Meek and
Phil Lilly provided the gym-
nasts’ only bright moments of
the meet. Meek grabbed an un-
official second (frosh scores do
not count) on the ﬂoor exercise
with an 8.55, and Lilly, scoring
8.1 on the sidehorse, gave his
best performance of the season.

Lack of a strong varsity team
-has bothered coach Neiger. “I
only have four men on my var-
sity squad,” he said.

“I would like to form a fresh-
man team,” continued Neiger.
“I had enough good freshmen
to make up a schedule for them.
this year, but our vlarsity was
4520 depleted we were forced to
use them unofficially in our
meets. They can't get as much
experience this way.”

Litchﬁeld, Mad, Panther Triumph

Dave Montrella edged
Tom Czartoryshi in a scor-
ing duel that resulted in the
highest scoring game of the
young dorm basketball season
as .Mormtre1la’s Litchﬁeld House
niprped the House of Lords, 52-
49. Panther House romped over
Peanuts Gallery, 56-40, and Mad
House took an easy decision
over Sutherland, 46-25, in two
other “B” games played Thurs-
day.

Accurate shooting accounted
for the_101 point total in the
Litchﬁeld-Lords game. .Mon-trel-
la led all scorers with 20 points.
C2lart:oryshi’s 18-points paced the
Lords’ attack. _

Litchﬁeld evened its record at
one victory, one defeat, while
Lords’ suffered its second fail-
ure in as many outings.

Panther’s win over Peanuts
gave the losers their first taste
of defeat. The triumph placed
Panther in first place in their
league.

Guy Kedzierski’s 12-poinlt ef-
fort paced Peanuts in the losing
cause. The Panther scoring was
divided quite evenly among its
lineup.

Mad reached a ﬁrst—pllace tie
for the “B” lead (tied with Pan-
ther) after their win. A 29-point
first half assured the easy vic-
tory. Sutherla.nd"s downfall in
tlhlis game was its second loss
in two games.

Bob Brickner led all scorers

with 13 points. His teammlalte,
George Pribish, contributed nine.
The Sutherland leader, John Ko-
oanchik, came up with only five
points.

BEFORE YOU VOTE TO DESTROY
STUDENT GOVERNMENT,

A STOP

AND LOOK AT THE ALTERNATIVE

  Remember:

You will be the ones who will pay the consequences,
not a senior who won't be here next year to see his

”brilliant”~ debate case collapse in the aftermath of
reality.

Why not support and strengthen the students‘ ONLY

legitimate channel of communication for articulating

students’ needs in the vital area of education, athletics,
  and social activities.
