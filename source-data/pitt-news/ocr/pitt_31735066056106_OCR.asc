Weekend homicide, carjacking shakes Oakland streets

Byjulie Sabol
Editor in Chief

An 18-year-old male was shot
and killed early Sunday morn-
ing in front of the McDonald’s
on Forbes Avenue.

The incident, which occurred

‘at approximately 2:05 a.m. On

the 3700 block of Forbes
Avenue, is suspected to be
gang-related according to Major
Crimes Detective Dennis Logan.

“There was an argument
between two gangs of youths,

words were exchanged and
guns were fired,” Logan said.

There were about four people
on each side of the argument,
according to Logan. During the
argument, one of the people
involved pulled out an automat-
ic gun and started shooting at
the victim, according to the
Zone 6 police report.

The victim was shot in the
armand the bullet went through
his arm and into his side, strik-
ing diis heart and lung, accord-
ing to Zone 6 Lt. Micknowski.

The victim, 18-year-old male
Andre Byrd, died. -
Logan said they did not know
of any reason why the fight
occurred and said it was “just
bad blood.” The police said
they do have information that it
is a possibility that the fight
started in the Original Hot Dog
Shop, according to Logan.
According t-o the police
report,,the suspect is a 18-20
years old, 5—foot, 11-inch black
male of large build. He was last
seen wearing a red sweatshirt

with a hood and the letters
UNLV printed on it. He was
possibly wearing jeans.

Along with the shooting on
Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh
police are still investigating
Oakland’s Friday evening car-
jacking.

The carjacking occurred

shortly after 9 p.m. Friday night

on McKee Place. A man and his
family were parking their car in
f.ront of their apartment when
three males approached them
and ordered them out of the

car, according to police.
The victim hesitated at which

. point one of the males lifted his

sweatshirt and revealed an
object, according to police.
‘The victim was not sure
VVl1€[ll€I',l[ was a gun or not,
according to the report.
The men then fled in the car.
No one was hurt, police said.
The McKee Place carjacking
was the second incident of the.
day. Earlier, a woman entering a
health club in Monroeville also

Young children awareof racism, says professor

By Jack Finn

Asst. News Editor

An African folk tale tells of two boys
who wish to trick a wise man. They plan
to ask the man if a bird in their hands is
alive or dead. If he answers alive, they
will kill the bird before showing it to the
wise man, proving him wrong. If he says
dead, they will open their hands, show-
ing the wise man the bird is alive, and
still prove him wrong. When asked by
the boys if the bird is alive or dead, the
wise man answers “it’s in your hands.”

It’s in your hands was the consistent
message given at the conference on fami-
lies and racism Saturday at East Liberty

Presbyterian Church.
Pitt’s Office of Child Development and ,

the Institute for the Black Family, along

with Louise Child Care/Pittsburgh Child
Care Institute, Pitt’s School of Social
Work, Children’s Hospital, East Liberty
Family Care Center, National Conference
of Christians and Jews and East Liberty
Presbyterian Church, sponsored the
forum. ‘

Keynote speaker Deborah Johnson, a

0 University of Wisconsin professor and
author of “Coping With Racism: Strategies

of African/American Children,” told a
crowd of about 200 concerned parents,

community leaders, educators and

activists that “there is nothing more pre-
cious to us than our children.”

Johnson explained that children as
young as 5-years—o1d begin to become
aware of racial differences. “Euro-
Americans may develop this awareness

slightly later. But‘ all children becoming ,

aware that there is a difference in skin
color or hair or eyes by the age of seven,”
she said.

Combating racism was a means of_

establishing a child’s self-esteem, as well
as making them more productive citi-
zens, Johnson said.

Strategies to cope with racism included
participation by parents in their child’s
education. “Parents must intervene and
make a child more visible in school,”
Johnson said. “Parents must empower
their child with resources.”

Attending parent/teacher conferences

on a regular basis was only a beginning.-

“Parents must keep communication lines
open with the schools. You have a right
to this, and schools have a responsibili-
ty,” Johnson said. . . _

Students aim
to create EM 7
staﬂ at Pitt

By Sam Gresock
For Tbe Pitt News

Plans are currently in the works for
the establishment of a 24-hour emer-
gency medical service on the Pitt cam-
pus.

Student Government Board member
Brian Bolton has been meeting with
students Dina Scardamalia and Deena
Breecher about implementing an emer-
gency medical technician service at
Pitt. . J _
Breecher, a Pitt nursing student who
is also taking paramedic training cours-

es, said the program will provide 24-

hour immediate medical care for Pitt
students.

Breecher outlined plans for the early
stages of the programs establishment
at Friday’s SGB meeting. "During its

first semester of operation, the pi'ograin

will cover the Towers, the lSchcnley|
Quad and Amos Hall,” she said. “We
will go to Lothrop, Forbes and
Sutherland if we have to.” Additionally,
the servi’ce'will provide 20 EMTs at Pitt
Stadium during football games and
other student events.

Under the proposed program,

E Breecher said EMTS will work an eight-

hour ovemight shift from 11 13.111. to 7
a.m. and four-hour shifts throughout
the day. Student volunteers will be able
to assist EMTS but cannot_provide med-
ical care without a certified EMT pre-
sent.

“We need about 30 people,” she said.
“Eventually our goal is to have all EMTS
but right now we just don’-t have
enough people 
go someplace without an EMT

Finding competent volunteers is one
of the program’s top priorities, accord-
ing to Scardamalia. “Other than insur-

ance liability, our big problem will be »

making sure student volunteers make
commitments and show up when they
say they will,” she said.

Since Pitt does not have its own EMT
training program, paramedic training
will be done in conjunction with

Several students walk through
the revolving doors of a stone
building which a sign identiﬁes
as The Ohio State University
College of l.aw. An old man in a
brown suit walks toward the

. entrance of the building, gazes

atthe sign and walks inside.
Sounds like a typical day in

. Columbus, Ohio. What makes
this scene so unusual is that it

occurred Friday on the Forbes
Avenue side of the Cathedral of
Learning, several dozen times.
The man in the brown suit was

'_  -Peter Falk.

Crews were busy filming
Rormznzales, a Peter Yates film

'-which will be "shot almost

entirely in Pittsburgh. One

"scene was filmed Friday on the

southern _patio of the Cathedral
of Learning. Curious onlookers
gathered on the limestone stairs
and. ledges to observe this

‘ unusual flurry of activity.

Peter Falk stars as Rocky, a
Polish immigrant baker who
adopts his ‘grandson, Michael

(D. B. Sweeny), in 1962 against
the wishes if the rest of the fam-
ily. Roommates follows the
close relationship of the two
over the next 30 years.

Michael enters medical
school, and later becomes a sur-
geon at a prominent Pittsburgh
hospital. Michael appears to
haveeverything — a loving
wife, wealth and success.
Tragedy strikes, however, and
Rocky once again must step in
to pick up the pieces of
Michael’s life. 

In addition to the scene shot
on the Cathedral patio, crews
transformed Cathedral room 524
into an Ohio State University
classroom, where Rocky sits in
on a lecture on the labor move-
ment of the early 1900s'while
visiting Michael at college.

Rocky, at age 75 in this scene,
lived through the labor 1nove-
ment and finds his personal
experiences contradict the
teachings of the professor.
Rocky interrupts the professor
and presents his own story of
the movement.

Students
celebrate
diversity
this week

By Matt Groffl
Asst. News Editor

Pitt students live in an
environment where they
go to class, eat and social-
ize with people who
come from very different
backgrounds than them-
selves. Instead of regard-
ing these differences as
flaws, Pitt celebrates
diversity this week
to help students appreci-
ate each other’s back-
grounds.

“This week is a show-
case of the diversity of the
student body,” Director of
Student Activities Joe
Cavalla said. “Various

, countries, religions and

races will be represented
in the events.”

Cultural Diversity
Week, in its fifth year at
Pitt, will feature exhibits
and speakers ranging
from an Irish storyteller to
forme_r Mayor of New
York City Ed Koch.

.One of the biggest
events of the three—day
celebration is the
International Fair to be
held Tuesday afternoon

on the Bigelow Patio of

the William Pitt Union.
According to Cavalla,

displays representing 40’

groups and clubs at Pitt
will be set up to educate
students.

“Most of the groups
are ethnic related,”
Cavalla said. “However,
organizations like Study
Abroad and Semester at
Sea will also be represent-
ed.”

Sensitivity will be the
focus Wednesday evening
at a multi-media presenta-
tion aimed to heighten
awareness and dispel
stereotypes. Videos and

music will be usedto ‘

reveal how our society is

affectedby oppression‘

and bigotry.

“The truth is, we have a
very diverse student body
and many people are
basically ignorant of
other’s culture," Student
Government Board
President Jacob Brody
said. “This is an opportu-
nity people should use to
learn more about their fel

“We need to look

at each other as real peo-
ple, beyond the differ-
ences or similarities they
may have with us,”
Cavalla said.

will also be addressed by
Koch as he concludes the
week by speaking on

Parking in Oakland not always convenient

By Don Lankey

For The Pitt News

.Schenley Plaza is one of the
busiest and most recognized
off—street parking lots in
Oakland. There are other park-
ing lots like Panther Hollow,
Teris Parking or Soldiers
and Sailors Memorial, but
patrons of Schenley Plaza lot
might wait a half—hour or more
to park.

“The parking lot normally
holds 250 vehicles, but we’re
able to fit 500 with key park-
ing,” said John Fedele, supervi-
sor of the parking at the
Schenley Plaza lot.

The lot is open to the general
public 24 hours a day, seven
days a week and doesn’t have
any pennits.

It’s 50 cents if you’re parked
less than an hour, $1 for the first
hour and 50 cents for each hour
after that. A ﬂat night rate of $2
is charged ‘for those who park
after 7 p.m., regardless if you
stay until 6 a.m. the next morn-
ing. The rates go up slightly on
days of football games_.

“When the school semester
starts up we’ll fill this to capaci-
ty by 9:30 a.rn. It’ll let up
around 4 p.m., but the people

_ coming for evening classes will

line up till 6:15 or so. There are
relatively few problems, but we
try to get the people parked so
they can get to where they’re
going,” Fedele said.

Some commuters prefer to
drive around searching for a
vacant meter. Depending on the
area and street the meter is on,
the meters have time limits
ranging from an hour to eight
hours. Some people try to avoid
any expense of meters or park-
ing lots by parking in undesig-
nated spots.

The commuters who try this
approach make the decision to
break the parking code

enforced by 10 officers that

patrol Oakland streets.

“The main purpose of the
parking code and enforcement
authority is to keep a smooth
flow of traffic and cite people
who are violating the parking,”
said Jeannie Meyers, supervisor
of parking code and enforce-
ment. ‘

The ‘parking code enforce-
ment officers relieve police offi-
cers for other work and write
tickets for various violations.

Fine amounts range from $7
for vehicles parked in streets
during street cleaning to $224
for those who chance parking
in a handicap spot without a
designated license plate or plac-
ard.

Starting this fall, parking
enforcement officers will be
equipped with hand—held com-
puters to issue tickets and keep
tabs on those’ who have out-
standing violations.

A person has 10 days to pay
the fine before summons proce-
dures are started. The fine is
increased and sent to the resi-
dence by mail.

A‘ vehicle with an accumula-
tion of five or more tickets and
five or more summons has
its vehicle plate number placed
on a “scoff law” list or “boot”
list. A l

Patrollers search out the vehi-
cles on the scoff law list and
post a ﬂuorescent orange sticker

to the front windshield and
secure a steel boot to one of the
wheels of the vehicle. To have
the boot removed the owner of
the vehicle must pay all fine
amounts plus an additional $150
in cash at the city pound office,
located at Smallman Street and
AVRR [Allegheny Valley Rail
Road] in the Strip District.

If the boot is tampered with
or removed otherwise, a $500
fine is assessed and the person
could be arrested for theft of
city property. -

“If the vehicle is parked on a
busy street or the owner doesn’t

make arrangements within 72‘

hours, the vehicle is towed to
the impound,” said Sergeant
Valenta, director of the tow
pound for the city of
Pittsburgh.” g
Depending on the type of
vehicle and how it is towed,
tow fees ranging from $85 to
$115 are added, Valenta said.
Once the vehicle is towed
to the impound, a storage fee
of $9 for the first 12 hours to
three days is added to the exist-
ing tab. After three days, the

storage fee is increased to $18
per day.

“If a vehicle is towed to the
impound during a Pitt game, the
[license] plate is checked for any
prior tickets and the vehicle
won’t be released until they are
paid,” Valenta said.

Vehicles parked on Forbes
Avenue and some sections of
Fifth Avenue and Bigelow
Boulevard will automatically be
ticketed and towed during peak
traveling hours.

Street signs are posted and
marked with “No Parking”
between the hours of 7 to 9 am.
and 4 to 6 13.111. on certain street
sections, and in some instances,
on meters.

People who chance parking

in‘ these areas during peak times

might not find their car where
they left it. Instead of it being
stolen, the vehicle might be at
the city impound.

If anyone has any questions
where to park or how to avoid
parking problems in Oakland.

parking department at 624-0687 0

For The Pitt News

When Mary Anna Smith was a
real estate agent in the South
Hills, she realized the impor-
tance of networking, a concept
she brought with her when she
started taking classes at Pitt in
1991.

"I think it’s real important
to be involved, and I’ve
seen many job opportunities
come from networking," Smith
said.

But networking is just one of
the reasons that Smith landed
the position of College of
General Studies Student
Government Council president
two years after her arrival at
Pitt.

A Pittsburgh native, Smith
decided to study administration
of justice and legal studies at
Pitt after an 11-year stint in real

. estate. sales.

“I wanted to change careers
and definitely get out of sales,"
she said.

. Smith commutes to Pitt from
‘Mt. Lebanon. “As a CGS student
who comimites, it was difficult
to meet people. So I joined the
American Criminal Justice
Association and that's how it all

started," she said.

Joining the American Criminal
Justice Association created what
Smith calls a “snowballing
effect” on her campus involve-

the easier it gets,” Smith said.
With the experience and lead-
ership abilities that today’s job
market demands, Smith said

Smith also said she feels
strongly that being involved is
about much more than enhanc-

Although going to law school
part time is another option,
Smith said she is anxious to start
working and put in use every-
thing she has learned.

So far, Smith said she is very
pleased with the way the

working.

The council’s major project
this year is to revamp the image

Its first image—boosting step
was reformulating the CGS

NASA chapter brings research
and community service to Pitt

By Courtney Chisholm
For The Pitt News»

The National Aeronautics
and Space Administration at
Pitt? Yes, it’s true. Actually
there is a charter of NASA, the
Mid-Atlantic Technology
Applications Center (MTAC),
housed right here on campus
on the eighth floor of the
William Pitt Union.

“We have been here [at Pittl

for about six or seven years,”
said Lani S. Hummel, execu-
tive director of MTAC.

MTAC is one of six Regional
Technology Transfer Centers
in the United States. Its pur-
pose is to share the results of
its research programs for the
benefit of the public.

MTAC has expanded greatly
since its creation, and it now
specializes in the transfer of
technology from federal agen-
cies and a broad variety of
other domestic and interna-
tional organizations.

Because MTAC works on
a one-on-one basis with
U.S. companies, it is able to
provide them with many ser-

vices that enables them
to manage the development
and improvement of technol-
ogy. -

MTAC is here at Pitt
because the university has a
contract with ‘NASA. “We are
also one of the university pro-
grams that has a community
service aspect to it,” said
Hummel. ’

“We do a lot of service pro-
grams on behalf of Pitt, so we
are making a contribution to
the university.”

“The community service
that we provide to the outside
community enables us to be
beneficial to the inside com-

munity [at Pittl,” Hummel

said. MTAC provides
many newsletters which
inform the public of the latest
NASA discoveries and devel-
opments.

“We also incorporate stu-
dents in our programs,” said
Hummel. “Last year we used
about 25 students. Students
help with typing and answer-
ing the telephones, and these
are paid positions.”

One of the biggest projects

of MTAC is the NASA Teacher
Resource Center (TRC). The
TRC was established to help
elementary and secondary
school teachers in teaching
technical subjects to children
by using exciting NASA dis-
coveties.

“The teacher workshops
help the teachers to become
more effective by using
space—related materials to
teach math and science,” said
Hummel.

“Kids love space and you
can teach them science
and math without them realiz-
ing what you are doing for
them.”

According to a TRC
brochure, teachers involved
in the program learn to
_capture a student’s interest in
science, math and technology
at an early age through
fun and educational experi-
ences.

TRC has also used many
motivational materials to
develop space camps. These
space camps work with local

organizations throughout the

Moving students focus
of Pitt organization

By Ed Abolins ’

For The Pitt News.

The efforts of the University
of Pittsburgh's cultural diversity
campaign have recently been
enhanced by one of the school's
newest clubs — the Global
Nomads.

As the name suggests, this _

organization is composed pri-
marily of students who have
seen other parts of the world.
But ‘their experiences go
beyond a nice two—week vaca-
tion abroad. Combined, the
members’ travels could cover
several decades and span the
globe several times. _

The Global Nomads have
lived, worked and traveled all
over the world with their fami-
lies, often for years at a time.

Zoey Breslar, the club’s presi-
dent, lived in Comoros (islands
off the east coast of Africa) until
she was 10, and she has also

lived in Katmandu and Mali.
Her father works with the U.S.
State Department, an occupa-
tion in which travel is part of
the job, and ever since she was
very young, travel has been a
part of Breslar’s life.

This moving around inspired
her to start a Global Nomads
chapter here at Pitt in the spring
of 1992, but it was not certified
until the spring of 1995.

Started in Washington, D.C..
in 1985, Global Nomads was
intended to give the children of
frequently-moving families the
chance to meet and share in
each other’s experiences.

While the organization was
started as somewhat of a sup-
port group for these nomadic
students, the. Pitt chap_ter also

focuses on informality and hav- .

ing fun.

I-Iannigan, who lived in

Medicine.

Scardamalia said EMT pro-
grams are currently in effect at
Carnegie Mellon University and
Penn State University.

A paramedic service, similar
to the proposed one, was in
operation at Pitt in the late
1970s, but the organization “did
nothave much of a structure,"
she said.

Bolton, who was unable to
attend the meeting, said in his

implementing the EMT service
would be minimal after the ini-
tial set-up cost.

Although the program is still
in its earliest stages, Scardamalia
said she is very pleased with its
progress. “Everyone we’ve
talked to has approved of the
idea,” she said. “We didn’t
think we’d get this far this fast.
\Y/e thought we'd run into a lot
of brick walls, but we haven’t
hit one yet.”

Scardamalia added, “It’s the,
V greatest idea. I think it will

also help with recruitment for
some students. It will help with
a lot of things.”

SGB President Jacob Brody
also responded favorably to the
EMT project.

“I liked what they brought
up,” he said. “I’m just a little
worried about when they hit
legal counsel, but it could work
if it’s kept separate from the uni-
versity.  _

In other SGB activities, board
member Tom Grassia said 12

Council, even though SGB has
not yet begun its ad campaign.

Grassia also said he believes
last Wednesday’s SGB open
house was successful because
six people attended the event
and showed interest in SGB
activities.

“If this is an empty house,
then if we ever have a
full house we’ll have to hold
meetings at Pitt Stadium,"' he
said.

Younger children rely on their parents
to interpret significant events, such as
hatred and racism. According to Johnson,
older children depend on their personal
experiences to interpret these actions.

‘To help all children cope, Johnson
cr‘lc<)LIi‘ages parents to use their own
experiences to explain feelings, actions
and alternative actions available. She sug-
gests that parents monitor the child’s tele-

shows with them.

Johnson wasn’t encouraged by the
medias presentation of black family por-
trays. “Are you aware that while we have
shows that depict blacks in the past and
present, there are no blacks portrayed in
the future?" _Johnson said.

Huberta Jackson-Lowman, of the uni-
versity’s Institute for the Black Family,
introduced Johnson and her topieto the

“One of the least understood dynamics
operating historically, as well as contem-
porarily, in this society is racism,”
Jackson—Lowman said. “If this country
were being as viciously attacked by exter-
nal forces as we are being undermined by
the unabated persistence of racism from
within, we would have long ago mounted
our opposition and begun defending our-

selves."

Crime

Continued from page 1

_ had her car taken from her at

gunpoint.There has been a defi-
nite increase in crime in the
Oakland area, according to
Logan. “|There arel too many
guns and too many drugs," he
said. .

“Overall, this year murders
are up, and a lot of them are
younger people cornmitting
them,” Logan said.

Gang—related activity is defi-
nitely on the increase, accord-
ing to Logan.“It’s obvious,
there’s a lot of murders and a lot
of shootings,” he said.

This past July, a man was shot
in front of the Original Hot Dog
Shop in what was also thought
to be a gang—related incident.

Police said they suspected the
victim was a member of the
Bloods while the assailantwas a
member of the Crips.

But Pitt "police Sargeant
Donald Green said he is unsure
if gang activity is on the rise or
if it is simply continuing.“Last
year or the year before some of
the same stuff was happening,
so I don’t know. if it is on the
rise. [Serious crime is] all over
the city,” Green said.

Director Yates took advantage
of the Gothic stonework,
murals, stained-glass windows,
wooden seats and decorative
ceiling of room 324 to create an
elegant law school classroom
for this scene.

Film crews littered the
Cathedral patio behind the
Stephen Foster Memorial and
the third floor of the Cathedral
with electric cables, hand
trucks, spotlight, ladders ‘and

the patio. Crew members, some

wearing plastic devil horns, per-
formed their assigned tasks.
Others coordinated efforts via
cellular phones and two-way
radios.

University of Pittsburgh police

insured that onlookers main-
tained their distance from the
film crews and costly equip-
ment and did not disrupt the
filming itself.

Trailers lined the entire length
of Forbes Avenue between
Bigelow Boulevard and South
Bellefield Avenue. One provid-
ed catering services, others
housed wardrobes, dressing
rooms, shop facilities and filin-
ing equipment. Still another
functioned as an administrative
headquarters for the day’s oper-
ations. A

A curious-looking yellow
hose snaking up from a trailer
on the Bigelow Boulevard side
of the Cathedral provided air
conditioning for those filming in

ing of the two scenes, the nearly

The extras portrayed students,
carrying books or conversing as
they enter and exit the doors of
the Cathedral near the fictitious
Ohio State University sign.
Extras were also used in room
324, as students listening to the
professor’s labor movement lec-
ture.

Most of the extras secured
their roles through agents or
recommendations. Some were
contacted by the Pittsburgh Film
Office from a list of actors who
submitted resumes presenting
their acting experience.

Carla Pignoli, a theater major
at California University of
Pennsylvania, explained the
rewards of working as an extra.
“It’s a long day, but it’s worth it
to see yourself on the big
screen,” she said. “It’s fun to
meet all kinds of new people.”

Working as an extra may help
aspiring actors further their
careers. “Someone here might

end up to be something,”
Pignoli explained. Knowing that
person may turn out to be the
“big break” a young actor is
looking for.  .

Yamimg, who has worked as
a movie extra in China, finds
contrasts between American
and Chinese filmmaking. “'It’s
pretty interesting, to see how
things are done here different
from over there,” he said.

Work as a movie extra holds a
multitude of rewards for Basel
Abunab. “You get to know most
of the stars,” he said, ’’Although
[the role] is non-speaking, you
get to see yourself on the big

' screen. And you get to know

the casters, which gives you a
chance at a better part in the
future.”

Global

Continued from page 5
Germany for 11 years, the
group likes to meet in different
ethnic restaurants in the area
and “talk about cultural differ-
ences.”

“Last year» was on and off’ for
the club, Hannigan said.

The group is small but grow-
ing. With 20 current members
and 15 possible new recruits
this semester, Global Nomads is
beginning to set its sites higher
and is now looking toward the
future.

Breslar said students who
have lived abroad sometimes
develop an identity crisis, “espe-
cially Americans who have
never lived in America. Our pri-
mary goal is to be a resource on
campus [for those studentsl.”

Global Nomads also has
members from Mexico, France,
India, Spain and England, and
the club helps them with any
adjustment problems they
have.

According to Breslar, Global
Nomads wants to expand
throughout the community and
speak to elementary and middle
school students about different
cultures.

“Right now we’re small

and want to work on campus,

but we hope to expand
[throughout the community in
the futurel.”

Breslar also said Global
Nomads wants to “get in touch
with other international organi-
zations of campus,” such as the
Black Action Society and
Students Around the World to
promote cultural diversity and
awareness. »

 

 

Safety priority

Rising crime rates have been the focus of many news
articles as well as political discussions across the nation
Hi the past few years.

The question of rising crime, especially violent crime,
and what must be done about it, has played a signifi-
cant part in public debate at the University of Pittsburgh
over the past few years as well.

The concern that Pitt would someday be likened to
Temple University in Philadelphia, Pa., which has been
branded with a reputation of not being a very safe loca-
tion to choose to do your studying, has been on the
minds of some individuals involved with security here
at Pitt, as well as other members of ‘the university com-
munity. ’ n

Events such as the shooting whichoccurred‘ on
Forbes Avenue this weekend have done nothing to
allay the fears that Pitt is becoming a very dangerous"
place. 

The university must do more of what it has been
doing, wl1ich is hiring more police officers to patrol the
streets of Oakland, as well as taking other measures like
the recent implementation of a new shuttle system to
provide safe and efficient transportation around
Oakland to students, faculty and employees. t _,

By no means can the University of Pittsburgh put an
end to all crime in and around our campus.

But in order for Pitt to continue to foster an environ-
ment conducive tolearning and growing, those who
work and study here must feel safe.

Additionally, students must use the services that are
being provided for their safety.

The shuttle system, especially since we’re paying for
it, belongs to us. '

It’s not be.j.n,g, ‘_‘;tOugl1” to walk home by yourself any-
more. .It’s just being stupid. Take the shuttles to show"
the university they are, in fact, needed.

In order to apprehend alleged criminals and keep the
streets safer, the Department of Public Safety must work
very closely with the City of Pittsburgh and its police
force. '

It will have to be a concerted effort, both on the part
of Pitt and the city. This is not an easy problem to solve
and unfortunately we all realize it’s not an uncommon
one either. i

If the university doesn’t do it for the safety of its stu-
dents, then it should do it for the sake of its pocket-
book. , '

The higher the crime rate climbs and the more unsafe
Oakland becomes, the less revenue Pitt will see.

Parents will think twice about sending their children
to a university where crime and lawlessness are ram-
pant T c A

And students will think twice about going to a univer-
sity where it’s not safe to walk down the street to the
convenience store for a midnight snack because you
might get caught in the crossfire of a gang war.

U.S. needs nationalized health care

Witli 37 million uninsured people in the U.S.

-and health-care costs spiraling upward, it is time

to do something about the health-care crisis.
President Clinton’s 246-page health plan has
finally been “leaked” to the public and has many
people scratching their heads.

Businesses will buy a standard benefit package
through regional “health alliances.” The package
is designedto be as generous as those of Fortune
500 companies. While there is no maximum
level, they must meet minimum guidelines. ,

The health alliances are

workers (including the military and veterans) into
the alliances and savings from slowing increases
in Medicare costs.’

The plan comes down to is a last—ditch effort to
avoid a national health-care system. It doesn’t get
to the roots of the problems facing us. ,

Judith Lave, an administrator in Pitt’s Graduate
School of Public Health, said that the U.S. must
“decrease prices, increase efficiency, reduce the
number of services and control technology." The
current plan does not address these problems.

When people hear “national '

allowed to form their own
alliances. The alliances are sup-
posed to give their members the power of large

-t corporations to bargain with insurance compa-
nies. Employers would pay 8O percent of the

insurance premiums with employees makingup
the difference. The unemployed and small busi-
nesses would be eligible for government subsi-
dies. Medicaid would be replaced by an alliance
plan, but Medicare remains untouched.

Each alliance is supposed to evaluate insurance
packages and offer its members three that fit gov-
ernment criteria. According to Nezvsweele, this
would reduce the number of insurance compa-

, nies from 500 to ﬁve or 10 firm.

The administration’s plan uses the unproven
theory of managed competition to lower health-
care costs. The idea is that after the alliances are

» formed the doctors, hospitals and insurance com-

panies will reorganize into “provider networks”
that compete on the basis of price and value. The
insurance companies, because they have to work
within government guidelines, are supposed to
resist price increases by hospitals and doctors.

To pay for the costs the administration wants to
use hidden taxes, savings from puttingfedcral

What makes these systems work
is that the government controls
the cost of health care at the source. There are
limits on what health-care providers can charge

for their services. For example, a drug company

can"t charge 50 dollars for a bottle of pills that
costs seven dollars to make. '

Also," guidelines will protect doctors from.mal-
practice suits. Doctors can earn a good salary
while charging lower fees because they don’t
need an army of accountants. National health-
care won't eliminate but will reduce the number
of private insurers.

It’s time to controlprices at the provider’s end,
set up guidelines to protect doctors and patients
from unnecessary procedures and lawsuits and to
start relying on more general practitioners than
specialists. Then, everyone can be covered
through a few insurance companies on a “pay or
play” system. Employers can either pay 80 per-
cent of their employees’ insurance or pay a tax to
contribute to a general fund. The unemployed
and elderly will be covered by the government.

The administration's, politically correct effort
has missed the bull’s-eye, though not by much.

#11 Ohio State rings upthe Panthers to the tune of 63-28

By Ryan Buncher

Senior Staff Writer

Early in the second quarter of
Pitt’s 63-28 loss to Ohio State at
Pitt Stadium, the game was so_

coach John Cooper sent in the
second string. V

By the fourth quarter, Cooper
was even rising his reserve kick-
er.

“I think the.best thing was
that we got to play all those
young football players almost a
half," Cooper said. “I think that’s
the best thing that happened to
us." a *

Playing a struggling Panther
team was not far behind on the
list of fortuitous events. Pitt

the gamefwas “no contest.”
“'lPittl was obviously out-
manned from the get-go,”
Cooper said. i ‘
That became apparent soon
after the opening kickoff left
Panther Steve Kalimanides’s
foot. It bounced short. OSU

' ,1r.‘rc1‘a‘ 7-0 lead? " ’

“The opening kickoff set the
tone for the whole ball game,”
Cooper said. “we challenged

our kick return team {this

weckl." L
The last time Ohio State
returned a kickoff, it was Carlos
Snow against the Panthers in
1988. The Panthers came back
to blow ‘out the Buckeyes 42-10
that day, but this time Ohio

State just kept on rolling.

‘‘We' were about as inept that
day as _Iohnny’s team was
today,” Cooper said. '

Pitt"s offense responded as it

oftendid last week against
Virginia Te"ch — three plays and
punt.

A short line drive by punter
Kevin Leon set OSU up at the
Pitt 47. The Buckeyes took only
four running plays in one
minute, 14 seconds to score
again. Flanker Chris Sanders
provided the big yards with a
28-yard reverse, and Raymont

Harris capped the drive with a
four-yard scoring run around
right end.

Pitt wasted a leaping 24-yard

‘reception by Junior Green and

punted again. Harris-ripped off
a 59-yard run, putting OSU back
in Panther territory. "The
Buckeyes moved in close on the
ground and cashed in on a six-
yard pass from Bobby Hoying
to Joey Galloway for the 21-0
lead less than 11 minutes into
the contest. ~ 

"It happened so fast,” Pitt

linebacker Tom Tumulty said.
“Before you knowit, it"s 21-0.”
The next two scores were
even closer together as Pitt start-
ed turning over the ball.
Quarterback Ken Ferguson was
picked off only two plays later.

to a tie   ,
Pitt, Seton Hall

scrap in
memorable
Big East battle

By Jeff Kamis
Staff Writer

SOUTH ORANGE, NJ.
— In a rain-soaked
affair which included six
yellow cards and two
ejections, Pitt hung
tough for 12()_ minutes
and tied Seton Hall, 1-1,
last Saturday in a key
Big East game.

Pitt’s Bobby Dyer and
Seton Hall’s Gerson
Echeverry were both
given red cards halfway
through the second half
for fighting after
Echeverry tackled Dyer.
Dyer had fallen on top
of Echeverry and was
slow in getting to his
feet. Pitt rookie Mike
Dyer, Bobby’s younger
brother, jumped in the
middle before any
punches were thrown.

Both teams were thus
forced to finish the half
and the two 15-minute
overtime periods short
one player. _

The two teams were
scoreless at the end of a
physical 90 minutes of
regulation thanks "to

Volleyball stumbles, rebounds at Hofstra-

Panthers fall
to Wisconsin,
defeat Hofstra

and N. Carolina
By Ryan Buncher

Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt volleyball team con-
tinued its road show with
mixed results at the Hofstra
University/Spalding Classic this
weekend.

Wisconsin snapped the
Panthers’ win streak at five
matches Saturday afternoon.
Pitt sandwiched wins over
Hofstra and North Carolina
around the defeat, raising its
season record to 6-3, all on the
road.

 slipped in one match
[Wisconsin],” Braziel said. “NY/e
couldn’t put a finger on it. If it
was complacency, if it was
fatigue, we couldn’t emotional-
ly get up on the road again.
We just had a major letdown
against Wisconsin. Not that
they were a better team. We
definitely did not get beat.”

There was not letdown a
against a shaky Hofstra squad.
The Panthers were not gracious
guests Friday night, as they dis-
patched the host Flying
Dutchwomen of‘Hofstra in
three games.

Pitt’s attack was balanced
(three players with double fig-
ures in kills) and efficient (.436

hitting percentage and only
seven hitting errors).

The Panthers rolled to wins
of 15-5 and 15-4 in the first two
games as the Hofstra attack
struggled.

The Flying Dutchwomen

kept things close with an
improved offense (.353 per-
centage) in game three, but the
Panthers pulled out an 18-16
win.

“We played great volleyball
the first two games,” Braziel
said.

“It’s the exceptional team that
can maintain intensity in the
face of [a lesser] challenge, and
our team is not there yet.

"We had a little bit of a let-
down in the third game,"
Braziel said. "We got a little
bored, then we got a little slop-
py.”

All-Tournament selection Ann
Marie Lucanie slammed down
20 kills for a .529 percentage
and chipped in 10 digs.
Redshirt first-year player Jennie
Driscoll was even more effi-
cient, with 12 kills on only 18
attacks (61 percent).

Sara Mitchell had 11 kills (50
percent) and junior Carrie
Thornton had nine kills and a
team-high 12 digs.

Hofstra’s guests were any-
thing but kind all weekend, as
the Dutchwomen lost all three
matches and fell to 5-6 on the
season.

While Hofstra struggled, a
young Wisconsin team (7-4)

came together to win all three
of its matches this weekend.
“Their coach said he felt they
played their best match this
year [against Pittl,” Braziel said.
“He was really able to do some
of the things he wanted to do.”

The Pitt attack, that had been

so efficient as the team rolled
off five straight match victories,
fell to a .179 percentage as it
lost to the Badgers in four
games (15-8, 12-15, 15-7, 15-5).

“That was without question
our worst match of the year in
every way shape or form,”
Braziel said. “Everything was
misfiring.”

Thornton alone had nine hit‘-~

ting errors, two more than the
entire team had against Hofstra.
She also tied her season-low
with only four kills. Lucanie (19
kills) and Mikla (12 kills) pro-
vided most of the attack, but it
was not enough.

Defensive specialist Laura
Horvath continued to be a
bright spot on the back line
with 13 digs.

“Laura has always been a real
spark for us on the court,”
Braziel said.

“This weekend she was a
vacuum. She made our offense
work at times when it was
sputtering [by making a good
first passl.”

Horvath, at a position that
rarely gets recognition, joined
Lucanie on the All-Tournament
team

“She was shocked,” Braziel

Tournament MVP Laurie
Smith anchored a solid
Wisconsin defense with 16 digs
to go along with nine kills.
Brigitte Lowrey and junior out-
side hitter Joanna Grotenhuis
both registered 13 kills in the
match.

The -Panthers righted them-
selves in their final match
Saturday night, knocking off
North Carolina (5-5) in three
games.

“We made a tremendous
emotional rebound in the North
Carolina match and really
played well,” Braziel said. “That
was a real bright spot.”

After a tight first stanza (016-
14), Pitt had a little more
breathing room in games two
and three (15-10 and 15-9).

Lucanie was the only Panther
with double figures in kills
(12). She, Thornton and
Mitchell all had 10 digs.

Pitt will make its first appear-’

ance of the season at Fitzgerald
Field House as the Panthers
host the USAir Classic.

7:50 p.m. Friday match, the first
Big East match of the season.

Pitt men's
tennis team
dominates

St. Francis

By Brady Slater
For The Pitt News

The Pitt men’s tennis
team lost just 10 games
en route to a nine-match
sweep in winning its sea-
son-opening match at St.
Francis last Thursday.

Using a lineup bal-
anced with youth and
experience, the Panthers
were never threatened by
the Red Flash in winning
all six singles and three
doubles matches.

“Traditionally, ' St.
Francis doesn’t have a
strong tennis team,” said
senior Jeff Campbell.
“But, it’s a good way to
start the season, and it’ll
help the freshmen adapt
to college tennis.”

Rookie recruits Braden
Doherty, Brad Wade and
Matt Mills all started for
the Panthers in a lineup
that also included seniors
Campbell, James
Chronister and sopho-
more David Dumpel.

Doherty started the
season without surren-
dering a set in a 6-0, 6-0

Women ’5

tennis team

splits pair

By Dan Lauso
For The Pitt News

The Pitt women’s ten-I

nis team split two match-
es over the weekend
against Robert Morris
College and St. Francis
College.

The Panthers traveled
to Robert Morris for a
Saturday afternoon match
against the Colonials.

Pitt had a tough day on
Saturday against Robert
Morris being beaten nine
matches to zero.

Head coach George
Dieffenbach was expect-
ing a hard match from
Robert Morris.

Scouting the opposition
Coach Dieffenbach said
Robert Morris “is much
stronger than St. Francis.”

Pitt’s Allison Baker put
up a valiant fight, lasting
three sets‘ against the
Colonial’s Natalie Arvelo.
Baker was eventually
defeated 6-2, 4-6, 6-4.

The other Panthers lost

' in straight sets to their
Colonial opponents.

Marla Zielinski lost a
hard-fought match by the
score 6-4, 6-3.

The other women on
the team played well, but
were beaten soundly by
their Robert ‘Morris coun-
terparts.

The tough times con-
tinued for the Panthers
by dropping all three
doubles matches. Baker
and Zielinski played solid
but were eventually
defeated, 8-4.

The next two matches
were dominated by
Robert Morris. Both Pitt
teams were unable to
take a single game, los-
ing 8-0 in their respective
matches. '

The final score of the
match was not indicative
of the way the Panthers
played, according to top
seed Allison Baker.

“We played well but
we’re still a young team,”
she said. Baker wenton
to say that the match
“was a good learning
experience.

"You have to lose some
before you can win
some,” Baker said.

On Thursday, Sept. 16,

_ the women’s team trav-

eled to St. Francis and
won its first match of the
young season. The
Panthers defeated the
Red Flash by a score of
five matches to two.

Allison Baker opened
the match ‘ by defeating
her opponent soundly by
the score 6-2, 6-2. Becky
Elliott followed suit by
beating her opponent by
the same score of 6-2, 6-

Deptb decides cross country

battles; Pitt men 3 team falls to
Penn State and West I/trgtnta

Byjason Feuchtwanger
Staff Writer

Two meets into the season and the Pitt
men’s cross county team is well aware of the
importance of the fourth and fifth runners on
the team.

It also knows what it means to lose a close
race.

Last weekend the Panthers lost to West
Virginia University by three points when the
Mountaineers’ fourth and fifth runners fin-
ished ahead of Pitt’s fourth and‘ fifth runners.
On Saturday, the Panthers lostrto rival Penn
State University by four points when its ‘fourth
and fifth runners‘ beat the Panthers’ fourth
and fifth runners. '

The Panthers traveled to Penn State to corn-
pete in the Spiked Shoe Invitational. Pitt lost
to the Nittany Lions 54 to 58. Lehigh
University finished ‘third with 76 points. St.
Joseph's A University, University of
Pennsylvania and -Duquesne University fin-
ished fourth, fifth and sixth, respectively.

“I thought we ran pretty well, but we’ve got
to’ get better at the four and five spots and the
kids know that,” Pitt head coach Jim Lear
said.

Junior Frank Nesko surprised the field and
won the meet with a time of 26 minutes,
eight seconds.

“No one expected Frank to win, [the team]
knew it was possiblethat anyone of our top
three guys could have won,” Pitt runner Mike

._ Lynn said.
“We had a good solid team performance 

I’m disappointed we lost to Penn State, it
would’ve been nice to beat them.”

Mike Umbleby finished sixth with a time of
26:29, Mike Lynn finished in 12th with a time
Of 26:48.

Matt Clarkson and Brian McCollough
rounded out Pitt’s top five finishing in 26th
and 28th place respectively.

“The night before we talked about our
fourth and fifth guys finishing in the top 25 if
we wanted to win,” Lynn said.

“Personally, I’m a little disappointed in
myself, I should have been up with Frank
[Nesko] and Mike lUmblebyl.”

Pitt’s fourth and fifth runners, Matt Clarkson
and Brian McCollough, are coming off injuries
which have interfered with their perfor-
mances. A ~

“Matt is coming off a serious injury and
Brian is coming off an Achilles injury,” Lynn

said.

“It’s going to take a little while to get them
back.”

“I thought we had a good race as a team, I
just wish we would start winning some of
these close meets,” McCollough said. ‘

The Panthers travel to Bucknell next week-
end to compete in a dual meet with the
Bisons. ’

“We’re looking forward to Bucknell, they

beat us by one point last year,” Lynn said. “So

we’re going to try to avenge that loss.”

PITT NOTES: The Pitt men's and women's
cross country teams both travel to Bucknell
this weekend for a dual meet with the Bisons.

4, and 4-6-1 — Cooper’s five
years from 1992 backwards —
aren’t acceptable at football-
mad places like Ohio State, but
it’s enough to sustain things
like bowl bids, television
appearances and sold out stadi-
ums.

Big deal? You bet. A

What those‘ three things do
for the OSUS and Penn States
and Nebraskas of the world is
this: it keeps the ship afloat 
on track  heading in the right
direction (pick your analogy).

It keeps the facilities up-to-
date, the athletic department
and team properly staffed —
the opportunity for success
alive.

osu didn’t have “OSU-type”
success the past five years —
that’s a given.

But OSU_did have the proper
interest on several levels
throughout the program to
retain a piece of the high
school-talent’ pie that fills its
roster every fall.

Which kept the seats filled 
the television cameras rolling
 the team, to a lesser extent,
winning. And regardless of
some misguided tactics by Mr.

Cooper in recent years, the

Buckeye tradition lives on.

As, if you were anywhere
near Oakland on Saturday (see
scarlet-and-gray attack), you
are slightly aware of.

The 25,000 Buckeye fans.
wandering around cement city

— shouting OH-IO. Buses from
Akron to Xenia. Toddlers to
grannies. _

Interest. Support. Money.

Which brings us back to
Coach Majors and his under-
manned Panthers.

Majors has said all along that
he would do anything legal to
make Pitt a winner again. That
starts with a full-fledged effort
by everybody remotely associ-
ated with Pitt football to sup-
port the rebuilding process -
to make sure it never wanes to
the depths it currently resides.

To totally state the obvious,

rarely does a coach steal a win
from a program. Program-
strong teams are always
stronger than coach-strong
teams. _
. Majors knows the death-pas-
sion of Ohio State football will
never transcend to Oakland —
not that severe, at least. But he
would appreciate and embrace
a semblance of an opportunity
to work with the material
Cooper finds a way to screw
up every year.

“[It would be great] if I could
be here in six years and be in
the same shape [as Cooper and
Ohio Statel,” Majors said.

He can’t do it alone. He
needs butts in seats, alums at
dinners and players in blue and
gold.

The question remains: will he
ever get the chance?

a big hole for the score on
fourth-and-one.

Dietrich Jells fumbled the
ensuing kickoff. Four plays
later George had another one-
yard score and Ohio State lead
55-0.

Although the Panther shut
out the Ohio State second-
teamers the rest of the half, Pitt
continued to stumble on
offense. John Ryan replaced
Ferguson with just over three
minutes remaining. He prompt-
ly fumbled the ‘ball and recov-
ered for a four yard loss.

In addition to three
turnovers. Pitt gained only 76
yards in the half. The running
game was nonexistent with 21
yards on 18 carries. _

Ryan put on a mini-rally in
the third quarter despite the
return of the. Ohio State
starters. On the opening drive
of the quarter, Ryan hit four of

four passes for 65 yards and a.

score. The drive began and
ended with passes to Billy
Davis, the score being a 21-
yard diving grab behind two
defenders. ‘

Rookie linebacker Marcus

Buford picked off a tipped pass A

to set up anothe.r touchdown
toss by Ryan. This time he hit

_]ells on the right sideline, and

the junior speedster crossed the
entire field to find an open lane
to the end zone.

“That was against our first
defense,” Cooper said.
“Obviously, they didn’t doa

since the beginning of last sea-
son —- and Seton Hall’s John
Maffeo. Constant rain, which
became heavy at times, made
the field slippery for both
teams throughout the game.

Pitt junior Eric Prex got the
Panthers on the board in the
firstovertime as he scored
thanks to some great work by
senior Eric Duffy. Duffy beat a
few Pirate defenders down the
left side before sending the ball
towards the net. Maffeo, mak-
ing his first start since a season-
opening win at Rider, came out
to try to make a play. The ball
tipped off the goalie’s hands,
landing behind him on the feet
of a wide—open Prex, who

deposited it in the Pirate net.

The Pirates got even with a
little over eight minutes remain-
ing in the second overtime on

a goal by Seton Hall forward
Steve Whelan. Whelan took a
cross from Tom Houston about
12 yards out, trapped the ball
and scored in the lower left-
hand corner.

Seton Hall head coach
Manfred Schellscheidt said that
Pitt played a good game.

“We were quite impressed
with the way Pittsburgh played
today (Saturday),"' Schellscheidt
said “I thought that they gave
a great effort, and they
deserved to get the tie out of
here.

“I think Pittsburgh came here
ready to play and did a good
job.”

Pitt assistant coach Chris
Karwoski said that the outcome
was good for the Panthers.

“A 1-1 tie against Seton Hall -

at Seton Hall is as good as a
victory,” Karwoski said. “I think

the guys played their best over-
all and they’re ready to go on

‘with the rest of the season.”

Seton Hall came out on the
offensive, dominating play for
most of the first half, but

_ Brodows and the Pitt defense

kept the Pirates off the board.

On separate occasions,
Noethling and senior Michael
Bacasa saved goals by clearing
the ball fromdanger, deep in
the Panthers end.

The second half was more
fast-paced as both teams had
numerous opportunities, only
to be turned aside by the goal-
keepers. Pitt’s best chance
came with a little less than 20

   
  

minutes to go when Maffeo
dove on top of the ball just
before sophomore Dean
Astorino could get his shot off.
Brodows was not to be out-
done, though, as he made
some divingsaves down the
stretch to preserve the tie.

“Kirk played unbelievable ‘in
the net,” Karwoski said. “He
did all the simple things and

' came up big on the hard plays.

“They got a goal on a good
shot on a wet day and it just
slipped into the far side.”

Brodows, who hails from
nearby Summit, N._]., said that
there was not that much pres-
sure despite the fact that he
was back at home.

“I wasn’t' that nervous
because I had nothing to lose,”
Brodows said. “I was getting
my opportunity to show what I
Could do.

Pitt almost won the game late
in the second overtime when
senior John Lopus’ free kick
from about 25 yards out
banged off the post to the left
of Maffeo. '

Senior Andy T souris said that
Pitt never stopped ﬁghting.

“In a game like that, you
can’t quit,” Tsouris said. ‘‘It’s
really important that the guys
coming off the bench fresh do
the job and stick in there
tough.”

CORNER KICKS: Pitt played
its second straight overtime
game, having tied SUNY-
Buffalo 4-4 last Wednesday.
Dean Astorino and Duffy each
had a goal and an assist, and
Noethling and Jeff Porter each
had a goal.
