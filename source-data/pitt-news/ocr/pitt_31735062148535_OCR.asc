Gauss Disagrees
With, Historians
On M achine, Age

By Edgar’ Beigal"
’ “It is not the past cen‘tury lllll}
the co111i11g~ce11tury wliich will
be knownas the age of 111d-
c'l1ines,"’ Dr. Christian‘ Gauss,
A dean of the College at Princeton
university, predicted in his ad-
dress on “Creative Scholarship” be-
fore the Scholars’ Day assembly’
Monday in Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Me-
morial Hall. A
In pointing out this error of the
historians, Dr. Gauss went on to
say that mechanization and ma-

chines will continue to bemore and p

more automatic and take over every
form of repetitionallactivity—white—
collared and manual.

Imagination Needed

As a remedy for the “super-ma-
chine age,” Dr. Gauss singled out’
the need for more imagination in:
scholarship. The technologists have .
done their part in creating, but‘
“scholars in social studies and hu-
manities have been too willing to go
back to sources and to certain
trends,” he continued.

Dr. "G-auss emphasized that man’s
mastery of this over-mechanized,
over—regimentcd, over-nationalized
world depends upon his ability to

“transform and create new instru-

ments. .1 order to provide jobs for
the unemployed, something new
must follow the telephone, the ra-
dio, the motor car, he added.

Task for Sociologists

According ‘to Dr." (’}’auss,"’i.t‘”is  

to the hu.manistic and social scien-
tists to capitalize on the creations of
inventors. Then they will solve the
“prob1€1’n of making the machines
which have been the instrument of
enslaving millions the instrument of
their liberations.”

The position [of the university in
he new age will center on the re-
orientation of human activities to-
ward humanly desirable goals. “Our
colleges must become not centers of
statistical information, of compila-
tion, but centers of free creations,”
he concluded.

SF A Committee Sets
Date for University

Elections, April 12

No-Politics Covenant Will Confuse
Spring Campus Political Activities

By Lew Riley
Spring campus elections will be held on Friday, April 12, in

Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Memorial‘ha.ll,tl1e executive committee of

Student-Faculty Association announced Monday.
This is the earliest date upon which campus balloting has taken

place in the last five years.

Robert R. Corley, assistant
dean of men, comnienting upon
the early date of this year’s elec-
tions, explained Monday that be-
cause this is a presidential elec-
tion year county voting machines
could only be obtained by the Uni-
versity if the student election date
was scheduled much earlier than
usual.

Women’s Elections

Although the use of the machines
was still in doubt early this week,
Mr. Corley said: “I feel reasonably
certain that we can use them again
in spite of the presidential election
complications.” .

Petitions for the student elections,
which must bear the signatures of
25 undergraduate voters, are already
available in the office of the dean
of men. They must be ﬁled with
that office by April 1 for SFA con-
sideration, Mr. Corley said.

Balloting for offices in all wom-
en’s organizations on campus will
be held on April 10, two days be-
fore the general campus elections,
according to announcement by the
dean of women’s office. Positions
to be decided on that date include
the ofﬁces in WSGA, VVAA, and all
undergraduate classes.

A Jumbled Political Scene

Announcement of this spring’.s
election date found the campus po-
l.iti.cal picture the most jumbled in
years. The most doubtful element
involved in the confused situation
was the political sentiment of 12
women’s sororities, which last month
signed a “no-politics covenant” by
which they expressed their deter-
mination to abandon fraternity slate
voting this spring. The signiﬁcance
of that document still was very
much in doubt in campus political
circles Monday.

Helen Wilson, president of the
women’s Fraternity Presidents’
Council that authored the news-
rnaking sorority “no-politics pledge”
last month, refused to be quoted di-
rectly Monday. A

However, Miss Wilson, president
of Zeta Tau Alpha, hinted that the
no-politics movement was still very
much in the “experimental stage.”
She refused to say whether she ex-
pected the 12 cooperating houses to
stand by their “voluntary covenant”
in the heat of the approaching fra-
ternity—independent campaign.

cently conducted a series of lec-
tures at the Museum of Fine Arts in
Boston and the Togg Art museum,

State Demands Death Penalty
As McCormick Trial Begins

Although attorneys for John
Lewis McCormick yesterday named
two University officials as defense
witnesses in the highly publicized
holdup murder case, Chancellor
John G. Bowman and Dean of Men
Vincent W. Lanfear had‘ not yet
been requested last night to make
an appearance at the Cleveland
trial.

Neither Dr. Bowman nor Dr.
Lanfear had been informed of their
selection as witnesses, and as far
as they knew, were not taking the
stand, they told Pitt News reporters
late yesterday.

McCormick’s attorneys yesterday
released names of seven Pittsburgh
witnesses with -whichthey expect-
ed to prove their case based on “not
guilty by reason of insanity.” Head-
ing the last were the names of Dr.
Bowman. Dr. Lanfear and D. Ed-
win Miller, principal of Peabody
high school.

As the third day of the trial
opened this morning, the parents,
grandmother, and relatives of the
former senior in the College pre-
pared to assume part of the re-
sponsibility for McCormick’s esca-
pades, climaxed on the night of
January 8, with the fatal shooting
of Cleveland telegraph guard The-
odore Nichols.

Admitted “a fantastic case” by
McCormick’s attorneys, the defense
will attempt to show how the deser-
tion of McCormick by his parents
led up to his “temporary state of
insanity.”

The state of Ohio is demanding

the death penalty for McCormick’s
action. County Prosecutor Frank T.
Cullitan is charging him with first
degree murder. '
I The original plea ﬁled by the de-
fense was “not guilty,” but on Mon-
day the insanity implication was
presented. '

Chancellor Bowman
lireets The Alumni

Chancellor John G. Bowman helped the Gen-
ral Alumni Association of the University cele-
brate l’itt’s 1:')I3rd anniversary at their Charter Day
meeting last Friday. Keynote of his talk was the
need of cooperation between faculty, trustees, and
alumni if the University is to continue its progress.
l\Ientioning speciﬁcally the need for a $50(),O00
increase in the operating budget to take care of
the University’s most pressing requirements, Dr.
Bowman pointed to the problem of raising more
money for Pitt. It is impossible to secure money,
he implied, if there are controversies which involve
the University.

The chancellor’s request to the alumni for an
understanding, for “belief in what the University
stands for,” may mark a change in the long-stand-
ing coolness in the relations between the Univer-
sity administration and the General Alumni As-
soeiation.

In the background of this alumni-administra-
tion hostility lie three events in recent years: 1.
the 1936 ﬁght over alumni representation on the

loard of Trustees; 2. the resignation of Dr. John

L Sutherland as head football coach and the

luinni investigation of University policies; 3.

he discontinuance of the University subsidy to the
Alumni Association last year.

There has been no secret about the fact that
the leadership of the Alumni Association has been
strongly opposed to some of Chancellor Bowman ’s
policies. Thus far, this opposition has not mani-
fested itself by any open action by the alumni.

But alumni president John B. Nicklas, Jr., in
his address at the same Charter Day celebration,
pointed out three objectives for the Alumni Asso-
ciation: complete self-support, revival of the
alumni-giving plan for fund raising, and represen-
tation on the Board of Trustees.

In spite of the words of good will which crop-
ped up at the alumni Charter Day celebration, it is
doubtful if a display of mere comment can patch
up what are apparently irreconcilable differences
in opinion between the University and the General
Alumni Association.

Quotes:

“We have maintained in the state universities
and endowed colleges that it is we who have trained
the leaders of the nation. The evidence is against
us.”—Dean Christian Gauss, at Scholars’ Day As-
sembly.

“Education is the leading out of the individual
nto an eﬁicient and fully integrated personality,
it home comfortably with himself and with his
fellows, and in the world in which he lives, equip-
ped to make a living and to live a life while he
makes his living and en rapport with the ultimate
spiritual realities that lie back of the visible phe-
nomena of the university.” Boston University’s
President Daniel L. Marsh states his deﬁnition of
modern higher education.

A New Column 
By Kalwary

I Lost My Friends!

What good is a past, if not to be brought up? I
refer to the dim long-ago——about one week back-—when
I put together two and two and discovered that Olga
and Oscar were hypnotized by that mysterious creator
of nit—wits-—Love.

' ..;..\.

It was then that this reporter re-
vealed the off the beaten path meanderings of Pitt peo-
ple. It was then that this column unselﬁshly supplied
Fuck Shoppers with extra-curricular literature. (It
ias been proven by careful observation that little else
s read by the great majority of Cathedral citizens.)

As such a space-ﬁller I lost some self-respect, con-
siderable respect for others and all the frustrated souls
who made me the object of their conﬁdence. No longer
was I consulted about the advisability of wearing a
green butoimiere when escorting a blond or of shaking
hands with Susie’s father when you had an infected
palm. I just lent an ear to conversations in the places
where it did the most good. Then, again, my contem-
poraries would approach me with a smile on condes-
cension and say, “So-and—s.o, and so-and-so and I-
of course, I :don’t want my name mentio'ned—were . . .
and saw . . . and did . . .”

Betty Teal wants to know whether I lost any friends
because of Pittpourri. “Yes, thank God!”

Callow Age

Somewhere in this smoggy atmosphere of short order
culture and business administration courses, there
might be a few observing but unobserved persons who
have a personal——possibly private—picture of their
school. In fact, there might even be some unambitious
but realistic mind with a copy of the following:

Callow age; slapping the forehead as the eyes skim
fuzzy-lined over line for line for thirty-one pages;
striped jackets—seventeen inch trousers--porkpie hats;
ztriped learrling—seventeeri inch -winds——porkpie cul-
ure; lying on the grass, elbow over eyes, kept awake
mly by the prick of a grass blade in the car; “And
why haven’t you done the assignment?” “Because I
Jidn’t give (1 good damn aboutthe assignment”; blond,
round, soft faces which will become stock brokers;
dark, long, rough faces which will become shoe sales-
men; new Gothic arches, covered with porous pressed
bricks; uniformed guides pointing out students as they
mingle; faces——faces.

The Pitt News

In the Mail

Editor’s note: We have asked Theodore
Starzlynski to write this letter easplaining his po-
sition on the matter of a campaign for Finnish
relief at the University. Last week, Starzyuski
refused the chairmanship of an SFA committee
which was to be in charge of such a campaign.
Up to the present time no new chairman has been
appoirited.

The fund for which the money was to be col-
lected is the Finnish Relief Fund, Inc, directed
by ex-president Herbert Hoover. It should be
pointed out that many other college campi be-
sides this onc have had controversies over sup-
porting the drive. The student council of Leland-
Stanford which is Hoover’s alma mater, refused
to offer organized. support to the drive. The
drives on other campi have been under fire.

We present below Mr. Starzynski’s letter:

Editor, the Pitt News:

In response to your request for an exposition of my
views concerning a program for the relief of civilian
war-sufferers, I submit the following considerations.‘
These I have divided, for the sake of clarity, into three
parts.

A. Postulates

1. Contributions would be made in the name of
charity, out of a humanitarian desire to mitigate
suﬁering.

2. Funds would be distributed according to need, a
system that transcends racial, religious, and poli-
tical distinctions.

3. Relief would be administered in accord with the
strict observance of American neutrality.

4. Contributions would be solicited for those peoples
who have fallen prey to imperialistic aggression,
not as a gesture of protest, but because it is pre-
cisely among these peoples that relief is most
urgent.

B. Aim

1. Relief would be construed as comprising those ar-
ticles of food, clothing, and shelter necessary for
physical existence and medicines necessary for
the preservation of health.

2. Only those would be eligible for relief who qual-
ify under the following considerations:

a. Those who are in actual need with no hope of
securing the necessities of life except through
charity.

b. Non-aggressors, since it is to be thought that
those engaged in wars of aggression could
readily divert their energies to the care of their
indigent if they so desired.

3. Political states would be considered as homogene-
ous units, so that no relief would be extended to
indigent minorities of countries that could not
otherwise qualify for relief.

4. Relief would be ektended to all indigent minori-
ties within any country that could qualify for re-
lief.

5. At present, contributions would be solicited for
the following:

. The Chinese peoples
. The Czech peoples
. The Finnish peoples
. The Polish peoples under the domination of
the Reich, since relief agencies cannot as yet
enter those lands under the rule of the Soviet.
C. Means

1. Funds would be distributed through either the
American Friends Service Committee or through.
the American Red Cross.

2. Funds would be distributed proportionally to the
population directly affected by war within each
country speciﬁed, and relatively to the intensity
of the needs of each particular population. Dis-
tribution would, therefore, be qualitative as well
as quantitative in principle.

3. The actual apportionment of funds would be left
to the discretion of the relief agency.

4. Contributions would be solicited in a manner sim-
ilar to the Community Fund Drive. An integral
part of the program would be solicitation within
the classroom.

Better in Dark !

An interview in the McGill Daily with a Rhodes
Scholar recently returned from England and blackouts
said: “Naturally recreation is curbed . . There are
fewer dances because the blackout reigns from 4:30 in
the afternoon to 8 o’clock in the morning. But stu-
dents still have dates, although i.t is quite disconcerting
to come out into a dark street at midnight with a
sweet young thing who resides about a mile away from
the place of entertainment. Nevertheless it has its
compensations-——er—hum—it gives one scope . . .”

Hmmm. We should think so!

Gone With The Wind‘?

The Daily Texan had a story last week which said:
“ ‘Southern drawl?’——There’s no such thing.”

“Like a ‘Western drone,’ the Southern draw] is just
a vague term the layman uses to describe the effect on
his ear of a speech different from his own,” said Miss
Katherine Wheatley, associate professor of Romance
languages.

Shucks!

Dance Investigator Compilers All
The Figures, Arrives at $163.18

“Say pal, can you lend me
$163.18? I want to go to all the
dances at school this year.”

So might say an extreme social
butterﬂy at the University who
plans to take in all the formal, in-
formal, afternoon, or.other kinds of
dances during one school year.

Investigation reveals that attend-
ance at 31 dances, with the attend-
ant food, corsage and other neces-
sary expenses will add up to the
sum desired by our borrowing
friends.

A pair of investigators, operating
independently, have compiled a list
of 14 dances, the so-called “big
dances of the year,” and disclose
that $97.50 ~would A be -required to
take them all in. Added to that fig-
ure is an additional expense of $25
for fraternity men to participate in
house dances and spring formals.

Average cost of a formal dance
date is ﬁgured at $10, and the in-

formal affairs are reckoned at about
half that amount. Corsages are
listed at $2 each for the formal af-
fairs, gasoline is down for $1 per
dance, and food totals about $70.

Admission to the 31 affairs cost
$43.68, while the 14 major dances
total $22.48. The Heart Hop and
Panhellenic Ball are the only dances
which hit the men lightly, for com-
putations were based on the as-
sumption that the girl paid for her
own ticket, the escort furnishing
the rest of the evening’s expenses.

Spring Festival Week, the most
costly part of the expense sched-
ule, is listed for $20. Running a
close second is the Interfraternity
Ball, with expenses of $11 for the
-evening. Other evening dances have
costs ranging from~:‘$3.50 up. After-
noon affairs are the least’ expensive,
costing about 75 per cent per couple
for each.

Let it never be said that it doesn’t
cost money to be a college man!

Aiiiitfy Keglers
Defeat PiKA ’s
In Title M (1tClt

Campbell Leads First
Independent Bowling
Titleholding Team

Displacing the Theta Chis as
imraniural bowling champions,
the Ainity club ended the frater-
nity domination bowling by cle-
feating the Pi Kappa Alpha. roll.-
ers in the deciding match last
Sunday on the Strand Alleys, 2-1.

The Amity boys won the inde-
pendent league toga by registering
15 wins against three setbacks and
entered the ﬁnal eliminations.

To win the title, the Amity bowl-
ers were forced to defeat the Pi
Kappa Alphas twice and the Indus-
‘trials once in the double-elimina-
tion playoffs. Wednesday Amity
topped the PiKA’s, then followed
with a two out of three win over
the Industrials. The second and
decisive triumph over the frat
team came after the PiKA’s had
topped the Industrials.

The win ended the long reign of
fraternity bowlers over other in-
tramural bowling teams. The new
champs are the ﬁrst independents to
ever win the bowling title.

Bob Campbell led the Amity team
by rolling up 201 points in the de-
ciding game. Up to the ﬁnal game,
the teams were on even terms.
Holsinger and Franchini also hit the
pins hard for Amity. This pair,
with Campbell, Henning, and Ed
Murphy, had a team average of 150.

Jimmy Klingensmith bowled the
high game for the fraternity cham-
pions, although the highest average
for the Pi Kappa Alpha boys was
made by Henry “Hank” De Rocher.

The Amity club squad included
Frank Franchini, captain, Jack
Henning, who won the individual
title for the independent league with
an average of 152, Bob Campbell,
Galen Holsinger, Ed Murphy, Al
Norbut, Charles Davies, and Bob
Scott.

Swimmers Get
Ready for EIC
Championships

When Pitt’s stellar swimming
team competes in the Eastern In-
tercollegiate swimming association
championships next Friday night,
two association champions will be
in the lineup.

Al Beacon, who holds the back-
stroke record of 1:41, and Wilt Le-
derstein, 1939 victor in the 440-
yard fre style event, will be defend-
ing their crowns.

Captain Al Slobodian, who ﬁnish-
ed second to Beacon in last year’s
race, is back with the Panthers
again this year and will probably
be the stiifest. competition Beacon
will encounter.

Coach Ben Grady is expecting a
great deal from Joe Orloff, sopho-
more 50 and 100 yard free styler,
and Dick Ames and Joe Kaule
Panther divers. Other men prepar-
ing to swim for Pitt are Herb Cos-
grove and Hyman Lederstein in the
breaststroke; Al Dill in the 220 and
440 yard free style; Bob Schraeder
in the 100 yard free style; and Al
Samson in the 50-yard free style.

Likely stumbling blocks for the
Cathedral merman are Temple’s
100 yard free style swimmer, Bob
Steingas, and the Owls’ 300 yard
medley relay team, both of which
upset Panther representatives when
the two teams met.

Franklin and Marshall has Jack
Miller and Lester Kachel, two
eswimrners of better than average
ability. Little competition is ex-
pected from the Penn State entry
because of Pitt’s decisive victory
over the Lions to the tune of 52-23.

Although Pitt ﬁnished third be-
hind Franklin—Marsha1l and Rut-
gers in the last year’s meet, a vic-
tory over Franklin and Marshall
last week, has established the
Panthers as favorites in the coming
Lancaster meet.

Potts Extends

Entry Deadline

Spring Intramurals
To Begin March 20

Intramural director James Potts
has extended the entry date for the
Spring program until next Wednes-
day, March 13. At that date all en-
tries for teams participating must
be turned, in. Competition will be-
gin March 20.

Competition, as usual, will be
open to all University men, and
three leagues, Fraternity, Engineer-
ing, and Independent will decide
their respective championships.
Those three winners will meet to
determine the intramural cham-
pionship, the same procedure which
was followed in the recent Win-
ter program.

Mushball, tennis, horseshoes, and
golf are the four sports offered on
the program this spring. All of the
sports will be run off on the round
robin style of elimination and, with
the exception of mushball, each
team will be made up of two men.

Trees ﬁeld will be the scene of
the mushball games and the adjoin-

ing“ horseshoe courts will accom-
odate the horseshoe pitchers. Tennis
also takes place on the Trees courts.
The Schen-ley‘ park links will be
used by the intramural golfers.

Entry blanks are obtainable at
the intramural -ofﬁce in Trees Gym,
where the ﬁlled-out forms are to
be returned.

Splash in All-Campus Swimming

All-campus swiniming honors Will be at stake today at 4:30 in

'l‘rees (“+_vm wlien fraternities,
top honors.

Swimininoy Coach Ben Gracly directed a qualifying round for
these teams last week and as a result only the best performers will

be eligible to compete.

Fraternities provided the closest
competition as 119 men splashed
against time. Delta Tau Delta, Phi
Epsilon Pi, PiKA, and Kappa Sigma
are leading the race after their
qualifying rounds stamped them as
the favorites.

In individual fraternity honors,
Soles, Delts, proved outstanding as
he won three first places in the 60
yard medley, 40 yard breast stroke,
and in diving.

Soles Sets Mark

One of the best times set in the
fraternity clashes was the mark
made by Soles in the breast stroke.
He was pushed all the way by
Kaufman, Phi Epsilon Pi, and Auk-
erman, Kappa Sigma.

Engineering qualifying rounds did
not draw so many men as did the
fraternities or independents, but
their ﬁrst place times were, as a
whole, much better than their op-
posing leagues.

Outstanding individual honors
were garnered by Trowbridge and
Andy Mosko. These boys each won
two’ first places to mark them as
serious contenders for individual
crown in the all-campus meet.
Trowbridge won the free style and
took ﬁrst place in diving. Mosko
won the 60 yard medley and 40 yard
breast stroke.

Final Results

Independents came out in full
strength for the qualifying rounds,
but their times were slower than
the engineers or the fraternities.
They participated in all events,
which should give them a reason-
ably good chance in the ﬁnals.

F. Mosko was the sole man to win
more than one event as he placed
ﬁrst in the 60 yard medley and the
40 yard breast stroke.

Teams Listed
In New League

Competition in the all-campus
bowling tournament begins this
afternoon at the Center & Neville
alleys. Eight teams representing
fraternity, independent, and engi-
neering groups make up the
league. '

The tourney will be run off on
the double-elimination principle
with the survivors in the winners
and losers brackets meeting in the
ﬁnals. The set-up, although sim-
ilar to the intramural league, has
no connection with intramural
standings, the all-point award, or
the interfraternity cup.

The tournament, conceived by
the intramural department at the
insistence of the bowlers in the
previous intramural tournament,
will ﬁll in the gap between the
Winter and Spring programs. _

Today’s matches are all sched-
uled for the Center & Neville al-
leys; however the remainder of the
ournament’s bowling will be done

League Leaders Engage Cellar
Clubs in Polar League Games

Two important games take place
in the Freshman Polar basketball
league tonight as the two teams
deadlocked for ﬁrst place, the Cold-
spots and the Defrosters, both have
engagements.

In the ﬁrst game the Defrosters
take on the last place Penguins
while the Coldspots tackle the Seals,
who share last place with the Pen-
gums.

Fast action was the keynote last
Monday as two close games were
played. The Snowﬂakes nosed out
the Coldspots, 36-34, and the Pen-
guins downed the Polar Bears,
45-41.

Phi Kappa likes Out Three Point Win

Over Jerks in Intramura

By Alex Zelenski

Phi Kappa, undefeated champion
oi the fraternity league, moved one
notch closer to the all-intramural
crown as they punched out a thrill-
ing 33-30 victory over the Jerks,
Independent champs, on, Monday.

The victors completely outclassed
their opponents in the ﬁrst half,
leading by a score of 22-12. Dur-
ing this ﬁrst period Jack Glenn,
all-intramural forward proved his
selection Sunday by netting nine
points to pace his team.

The Jerks did not look like the
team that won the Independent
championship in this ﬁrst half; their
shots were wild and their passes in-
accurate.

As the minutes began to tick away
in the second half, Bonelli and Mal-
loy went on a spree making seven
points each to bring their team
within striking distance of the Phi
Kaps.

At this point the game started to
get rough, and only through ﬁne of-
ficiating by Frank Ohl and Red
Foley was ﬁghting kept to a min-
imum.

This unorthodox play caused both
teams to lose key men. Tom Hallor-
an and Butch Goodell of the Phi
Kaps, and Malloy of the Jerks were
banished via the personal foul route
midway in the second half.

With one minute to go, the Phi
Kaps had a one point lead, when

Tyberski made two fouls to put the
game on ice.

Phi Kappa success can be attrib-
uted mainly to its brilliant all
around play and ﬁnesse. John Ty-
berski can easily be called the for-
gotten man of the Phi Kap team as
his ﬂoormanship and ﬁght were
overlooked the entire season.

Panther Spike-Wearers Enter Central
Intercollegiates on East Lansing Track

After meeting with fair success in
the IC.AAAA indoor championships
at Madison Square Garden, the Pitt
track team makes a try for another
title this week-end in the Central

Intercollegiate conference indoor
championships at East Lansing,
Michigan.

Again the Pitt squad is not favor-
ed to win the meet, but will be a
contender with Notre Dame, Michi-
gan State and Marquette. Notre
Dame has been a perennial winner
in this event, their indoor condition
almost as good as their outdoor.

The Panthers’ chief objective will
be to keep the mile relay crown they
have held since 1933. Last year’s

CIC meet marked the initial win for
a Panther quartet that W-ent on to
break the Penn Relays record, after
the same kind of dismal indoor
showing.

In addition to the defense of the
mile relay title, Frank Ohl defends
the 440 yard dash title he won last
year. Johnny Bazyk seeks to re-
lain his Shot put crown while Allen
McKee may enter the half mile in
hopes of keeping at Pitt the toga
Johnny Woodruff won last. year.

Ohl, who tied his University.rec-
ord in the broad jump Saturday
night, will be unable to compete in
his favorite event as the CIC pro-
gram doesn’t include the distance
leap.

points, were the outstanding men
on the Jerks team.

Jack Glenn ﬁnished the game
with 14 points to again lead his Phi
Kap team.

The Jerks must now play the Oil
& Gas team and then the victor
plays the Phi Kaps for the all-in-
tramural championship.

points for the Snowﬂakes in the last
25 seconds of play to break a dead-
lock and sew up the ball games for
Artman’s team. The lead and see-
sawed back and forth in this game
with the Coldspots holding a four-
point edge at the half.

Swacus, of the Snowflakes, took
scoring honors with 14 points to his
favor while Goldsmith was close
behind with 13 markers for the
losers. Artman, with 12 points
played outstanding ball for the vic-
tors, and Stern who also garnered
12 points, showed well with the
Coldspots.

A fast six point splurge in the last
minute of play decided the second
game in favor of the Penguins over
the Polar Bears.

Lewis, Penguin forward, proved
the scoring star of the day when
he chalked up 17 markers after his
name. Frazier and Peretic also
demonstrated ﬁne form although
neither did much scoring. Silver-
man, Lohmeyer, and Leonard, with
12, 11, and seven points respective-
ly played well for the losers.

By Student Opinion Surveys

AUSTIN, TEX., March 4.——-Stu-
dent thought on the college cam-
pus, like public opinion elsewhere
over the nation, is now turning to-
wards the November elections and
the issues that are likely to be in-
volved. The collegians of the
country agree with the American
voter that the most important prob-
lem of the day is how to keep the

United States out of war. Unem-
ployment comes next.
Interviewers for the Student

Opinion Surveys, of which the Pitt
News is a member, asked students
over the nation “What do you be-
lieve is the most important prob-
lem facing the United States to-
day?” From every section, New
England to the deep South, Middle
Atlantic to the Far West, the an-
swer of the greatest number was
the same: how to stay out of war.
Many other problems were men-
tionedﬁfas follows: ‘
1. Keeping the U. S. out of
war . . . .  . . . . ..43%

5 2. Solving unemployment.17
3. Balancing the budget. 7
4. Solving labor problems 3
5. Recovery of business. . 3
6. Threats to democracy,. 2
7. Inequality of 'incomes.. 1
8. Solving youth problems 1
9. The 1940 elections. . .. 1

10.Relicf . . . . . . . . .  1/
11. Others and no opil1i0n-21

In this‘ instance, as has been the
case in many Surveys, college peo-
ple show practically the same sen-
timents that other studies of the
general electorate have pointed Out.
The question of war and ﬁnding em-
ployment for the jobless are para-
mount; in. the minds of most Amer-
icans, young and old. Business re-
covery, however, seems to be more
important to the average voter, who
placed that third in the latest sam-
pling of opinion, while the colle-
gians gave third place to the budget.

It is signiﬁcant that the college
student has consistently demon-
strated parallel feelings regarding
Europe’s troubles, for the Surveys,
using a scientiﬁc cross section that
represents thetotal U. S. enroll-
ment, has found:

1. In October most students said
we should not send troops to help
the allies, even if they were in
danger of losing to Germany.

2. At the same time, 58 per cent
opposed change of the neutrality
law, mainly because they believed
to do so might involve us.

3. In December 68 per cent be-
lieved we could stay out of the war.

Sympathy for Finland, however,
seems to be strong enough for stu-
dents to sanction loans of American
cash to that country, as the Sur-
veys indicated in January. Subse-
ousnt shifts in these sentiments fu-
ture Surveys will show.

AUSTIN, TEX., March 5.——Cur-
rent reports that swing music has
lost ﬁrst place among dancers are
substantially correct. at least among
college students. They have voted
a preference for “sweet” tunes by a
two-to-one majority in a nation-
wide poll of American campuses.

“Which do you like best, swing
music, or the so-called sweet mu-
sic?” was the question presented to
a representative sampling of colle-
gians by the Student Opinion Sur-
veys of America.

From the answers they gave, it
is evident that jitterbug music,
which took the country over last
year, is deﬁnitely out, for the time
being anyway’. Only ‘32 per cent
declared they preferred swing, while
66 per cent said “sweet’._’ music like
that of‘ the Lombardos and the
Kings was their favorite. A small
group of 2 per cent said, “Neither.”

Men and women students show
practically the same preferences,
although there are more boys’ than
co-eds who still swing. When the
ballots were tabulated by sexes.
these were the results:

Men Women

Swing . . . . . . . . . . .33% 30%
Sweet . . . . . . . . . . . .64 69

Neither . . . . . . . . . . . 3 1

Brieﬂy, here’s a story in half a
peanut shell!

All the energy the average per-
son uses in his thinking during one
day could be obtained by eating
one peanut, says Dr. E. Alfred
Wolf, associate professor of biology.
The average college student, how-
ever, uses that much energy in one
hour’s sustained mental work.

The average college student takes
rom 1,200 to 2,400 calories a day
for mere subsistence. Anything he
does-—even eating-—must be added
to this basal metabolism ﬁgure.

The average football player, for
instance, needs enough energy to
raise six gallons of water from

freezing to boiling point, Dr. Wolf
added.

You could talk for two hours on
the energy you need to eat your
food everyday. Maybe that’s the
origin of the saying, “She’d rather
talk than eat.”

Then, the student who plays
Bach on the piano adds only 40
calories to his basel mtabolism; if
he plays one of Teddy W'ilson’s
musical gyrations, his ﬁgure will be
upped to 560 calories, which is the
same number used when trotting
down to the corner pool room.

Wrestling is by far the most
strenuous sport, says Dr. Wolf. It
would take 125 hours of thinking
to use up the same energy that you
