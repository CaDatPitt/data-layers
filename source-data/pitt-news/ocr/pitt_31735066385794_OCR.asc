UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH
Condom sellers face controversy over use of Panther logo

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

Pitt ofﬁcials say that Dina Pearlman and
Emily Parker are violating licensing policy

by using the university's logo to sell “Primo I

Panther Condoms” without permission.
The two Carnegie Mellon University
seniors, who have covered the campus in
the last three weeks promoting a package
with a picture of a panther putting a
condom on its tail, said that they aren’t
even using the logo.

“We are not using the Pitt logo. We are
using the picture of a panther. It is a
panther logo, not a Pitt one. Nowhere on
the condom does it say Pitt,” said Pearlman.

“The colors on the package aren’t even
Pitt’s. Sure, they're blue and gold, but they
are nowhere near the same shade that Pitt
uses. This is ridiculous."

According to Mary Bonach, director of
book centers, the university sent a certiﬁed
letter to Primo ‘Panther Protection after
discovering that Parker and Pearlman were
selling the condoms with a panther logo.

“Anyone who wants to use the logo has
to apply for a license before using it. There
is a procedure that everyone has to follow.
We were not even aware of thexfact that
they were selling these things until
lrecentlyl,” said Bonach. “Right now we
are just waiting for them to respond to the
letter, and then we’ll take it from there.”

VOLUME EIGHTY-FOUR, ISSUE NINETY-THREE

Pitt charges 6 percent of a company’s
gross profit if it has been granted permission
to use the logo.

“This is a serious problem. When we
find out that something like this has
happened, we follow through and try to
do something about it. Not just with this
particular case but with every case,” Bonach
said.

Pearlman said that a company in Boston
which manufactures the condoms for them
is in charge of “licensing and the legal end
of it." She added that the panther logo is
not exclusive to Pitt.

“How many high schools and colleges
around use the panther? It isn't just Pitt;
that’s for sure,” Pearlman said.

 

Franklin Carter, director of Student Health
Services, said that he believes that Parker
and Pearlman have violated some other
university rules.

“It’s against university rules to be
soliciting in residence halls, and I read that
that’s what they were doing,” Carter said.
“There really is no need for this since
condoms are available on campus at the
student health center."

Parker said that she was not aware of the
policies against solicitation in the dorms.

“We didn’t find out that it was against
the rules until after we had already done‘
it. As soon as we found out, we stopped,”
she said.

Pro pool
player
performs

By Joseph Bruce
For The Pitt News

Jack White, an internationally
famous pocket-billiards trick-shot
artist, entertained onlookers with
trick shots and pointers at the
William Pitt Union Recreation
Room Monday afternoon.

“If he comes close [to beating
me], everyone who reads [the
article about me tomorrow] will
get $50,” said White, when he
played Pitt student Grant Adams
in a game of pool. After White
sank the 9-ball on his breaking
shot, the winning play in the
pool game “9—ba1l,” it was
apparent that no one would
collect on his offer.

“Jack White is the greatest. He
is fun, entertaining, and I love
him. We all look forward to seeing
him here every year,” said Dalel
Khalil, who watched the artist at
work.

Conference addresses family social problems in the '90s

By Iaurie Lehosky
Staff Writer

Of the many babies coming
into the world everyday, a
growing number are born addicts
due to use of drugs by their
mothers during pregnancy.
Affecting the most basic of family
units, addicted mothers and their
babies were one of the current
problems addressed at a
conference presented last night
by the Bachelor of Arts and Social
Work Club and the Student
Executive Council.

The “Problems Facing Families
in the ’90s" conference held in
the William Pitt Union featured
workshops on the subjects of

addicted mothers and their babies
and ritualistic crimes.

According to BASW member
Eileen Connor, all the social-work
programs helped fund the
conference in observance of
National Social Work Month. The
theme of the month is
“Strengthening Families.”

Connor said BASW wanted to
hit all audiences with the
conference starting from infants
to adolescents and then adults.

Toni Pendleton, executive
director of Womanspace East,
Inc., an area women's health
clinic, said that in the addicted
mothers and babies workshop,
there is a need for centers which
will include women and their

children.

“We need to provide programs
for children as well as the mother,”
said Pendleton.

Pendleton added, “The shelter
is the last stop for the mother.
They have multiple problems
following them including
problems of [selﬂ esteem, needing
and wanting to be loved.”

Pe ndleton feels that solving the
problem of addiction calls for
more intense therapy and
programs.

“We need a total hurnan-service
agency to take care of these
issues,” she said.

director of outpatient services at

Pitt Men's Glee Club
celebrates centennial

By Joseph Bruce
For The Pitt News

With the alumni joining in for
the final song, “Hail to Pitt,” the
University of Pittsburgh Men’s
Glee Club centennial spring
concert was ended with a
standing ovation Sunday
afternoon at the Belleﬁeld
Annex.

The alumni present ranged
from the class of 1936 to last
year’s seniors. Don Disque, class
of 1952, an alumni of the Men’s
Glee Club, said, “llt was a] very
rewarding experience for me as
an alumni; [I] hope the group
can continue to gain strength.”
The ﬁnest quality of the Men’s
Glee Club is “the camaraderie it
promotes amongst each other.
[It] goes beyond the academics
of the university,” according to
Mildred Posvar, who was named
Honorary Centennial
Chairwoman, and also one of
their largest supporters.

The Men’s Glee Club is the
oldest non—athletic student
organization on campus with
200 alumni in attendance for the

health clinic, focused on treatment

I of disease and addiction.

“In 1955 the American Medical
Association first recognized
addiction as a disease, and most
victims were men,” said Elsesser.

‘She added, “Today many
women are abusing cocaine.
Women who want treatment don't
have what they need to get it.”

Elsesser proposed the idea of a
six-month residential program for
recovering addicts to “use the
period of this time to become
chemically free.”

According to Elsesser, recent
statistics from the Drug and
Alcohol Program in Pennsylvania
show that 74 percent of men and
26 percent of women are in

concert. Its tradition extends off
campus as Mayor Sophie Masloff
proclaimed Saturday, March 17,
as the University of Pittsburgh
Men’s Glee Club Day in
Pittsburgh.

After the concert, there was a
reception in the William Pitt
Union which gave the current
members an opportunity to meet
with their predecessors. When
asked why he joined, Jonathan
Glenn said, “T 0 do what I like to
do best, sing music.” The end of
the concert did not stop the
enthusiasm of the Men’s Glee
Club, as it could be heard singing
with alumni at the reception.

On April 30, the Men’s Glee
Club will be undertaking a three—
week European tour, which has
been in the planning for two
years.

Mrs. Pos'var’s work has led to
the appearance of the Men’s
Glee Club at the New College at
Oxford. In addition, the Men’s
Glee Club audience with the
Pope has been made possible
with the help of Mrs. Posvar and
Bishop Whurle, who has been

treatment.

“These services aren’t ones
which are easily available,” she
said.

Elsesser stressed, “Addiction is
a disease, and group treatment is

a very important part of
treatment.”
When the patient is in

rehabilitation, one must learn
independent living which
includes recovery and self-
sufficiency, according to Elsesser.
“Addiction is a family disease. It
involves everyone who has a
close relationship to that person. ”

According to Elsesser, addiction '

affects about 10 percent of the
population.

condoms at $1 apiece. The initial ‘

cost to have the product made
was $500.

“Hopefully some time we will
break even. We each make a
quarter every time we sell a
condom, but money isn’t the
reason that we started. This is a
matter of safe sex and saving
people’s lives,” said Pearlman.
“Some people have suggested
that we charge $2 or $5, but I

' wouldn’t feel right about that. I

feel more like we are doing a
service.”
Pearlman pointed out several

reasons that the two sell the
condoms on the Pitt campus
rather than at their own school.

“The bottom line is that Pitt is a
lot bigger. For us to sell 1,000
condoms at CMU, we would have
to talk to about a fifth of the
students,” said Pearlman. “Pitt
seems to be a lot more relaxed.
CMU is just a much more uptight
place.”

Pearlman said that the reaction
from people whom they approach
on campus has been mixed.

“The students that we talk to
are generally very supportive. It’s

from the older people that we get
a lot of problems. In their minds
we are promoting sin, which
makes me a sinner, and we are all
going to hell,” she said. “This isn’t
a moral question; it is a question
of protecting yourself.”

Pearlman added that they have
recently approached owners of
local stores to sell the condoms.

“Going person to person on
campus just takes too much time.
So far we have gotten four
Oakland stores, one store in
Shadyside and one bar to sell
them for us,” she said.

Anew attitude for tbeBAS

Normally the Black Action Society would have held its
annual election for leadership positions yesterday. Unfor-
tunately, there were only three candidates for the two
positions. One of those candidates was forced to with-
draw after failing to meet BAS office’ requirements.

It’s a shame that more students did not run for chairper-

son or deputy chair. If there is one organization in which
apathy should not be a problem, it should be the BAS. Yet
the fact that less than a dozen people showed up for meet-
the-candidates night last week seems indicative of that
problem.

So it is to the benefit of the BAS members that their new
officers, Chair Doug Ligons and Deputy Chair Marta
Effinger, are determined to make the BAS a more visible,
decisive and inﬂuential organization. » '

The BAS has come a long way since it was founded in
1969. The ground it has gained is due to the concern of
the students and staff involved. not any concessions from
the university. While it represents the largest registered
group of black students on campus, its endeavors go
largely unnoticed by the university population. Perhaps
the hard-line stance that Ligons and Effinger intend to
draw will change that.

“Get in our way, obstruct us from doing what we think
is right, and [though] we’re not going to start breaking
rules, there's going to be controversy. Work with us, and
there will be a resolutions,” said Ligons.

A little controversy might do wonders for all parties
involved, yet Ligons’ mandates seem too strong to result
in simple controversy. Rather, it appears that individuals
or organizations will either be with or against the BAS.
That leaves no room for compromise, which is needed if
goals are to be met; j

The fact that the BAS is willing to isolate itself to. reach
its goals should prove to the university community that
there are problems in policy and communication, among

T other things. Although all student groups wish to be taken

seriously, this is more than a student group. It is a culture
striving to be recognized, a group of students attempting
to excel in the face of real and perceived racism, a
contingent yearning to learn from black professors, not
just from professors teaching black history.

These are not unacceptable propositions. Ligons and
Effinger are justified in drawing hard-line platforms, just
as outgoing chairperson Terri Tinnen was justified in
acting in a diplomatic, albeit goal-oriented manner during
her tenure. University officials, students and groups
should realize that the BAS does not want attention. It
wants action, whatever the means.

While we hope that the university community realizes
the needs of the BAS, we also hope that Ligons ‘and
Effinger drop their guard somewhat. As Ligons said, only
by working together will there’ be‘ a resolution.’ ”

Steps to alleviate incurable pain

My uncle Colin died more than
five years ago from terminal liver
cancer. When he was first diag-
nosed, it was found to be so
advanced that chemotherapy or
radiation therapy would have
been totally useless. The main
battle was to control the constant,
agonizing pain until his death,
which came four months after the
six he was given at the time of the
diagnosis.

I try sometimes to concentrate
on the person ‘my uncle was
before the cancer struck: an avid
hunter and fisherman, a talented
engineer, a dedicated family man.
But my mind always snaps back
to the image of him at half his
normal weight literally gritting
his teeth against‘ the pain that
injections could no longer dull.
He had been given Demorol at
first; then later morphine. But in
the end, even if a shot was given,
it had little effect. When Uncle
Colin finally died, my aunt
thanked God that he no longer
had to feel such agony.

America has the best hospitals
and doctors in the world, but my
uncle would have been much
better off had he been treated in
Great Britain. He would still have
passed on, but the course of his
illness would have been much
easier. This is because physicians
in England are permitted to use a
powerful, effective narcotic pain-
killer that is currently banned in
this country, even from dispen-
sion by licensed professionals.

That drug is heroin.

Heroin is 15 times stronger by
volume than morphine; the next
strongest narcotic. This means,
of course, that an injection one-
fifteenth the size has essentially
the same painkilling potential,

which is a great advantage when
there are few places left on the
patient’s body able to stand an
injection. British physicians and
nurses have also said that pa-
tients seem to be more coherent
when they are treated with her-
oin than with morphine. Despite
these beneﬁts, this drug is still
completely unavailable in this
country for such legitimate use.

Lobbyists on Capitol Hill have
tried to persuade Congress to
pass legislation allowing for her-
oin to be prescribed by doctors
under the same restrictions as
morphine and other narcotics.
Congress, though, has been slow

It is a very blind policy that
bans a drug from medical use

Strong finish leaves Lady Panthers +.500 for season

By Sean Hellman
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball
team completed its first winning
season in five years at the Big
East tournament on March 3 and
4. The Lady Panthers began the
tournament with an 84-77 upset
victory over Seton Hall before
losing 89-88 to nationally ranked
Providence in Storrs, Conn.

The Lady Panthers (15-14)
finished the season strong,
winning key games to earn sixth
place in the conference. Three of
Pitt’s losses down the stretch came
on the road against St. John’s (86-
81), in overtime against the Big
East’s top-seeded Connecticut
(82-80) and to highly ranked
Providence.

The Lady Panthers began a
youth movement this season with
four freshmen playing major roles.
Their performance in the
tournament has sent a message
that Pitt may be a contender next
year

“We knew when the season
started that we had a chance to
use at least three freshmen,” said
Pitt Coach Kirk Bruce. '

The freshmen made a strong
first impression.

Point guard Maureen
McConnell and forward Turia
Ransom were named to the Big
East a1l—rookie team.

McConnell averaged 37 minutes
and 9.4 points a game. She led
the team in assists with 139.

Ransom averaged 20.5 minutes
a game and was second on the
team in rebounds (6.7 a game)
and ﬁeld-goal percentage (.512).

“Turia gave us the spark that
we needed off the bench,” said
Bruce. “She more than lived up to
our expectations.”

Guard/forward Jill McElhinny,
along with McConnell, started
every game this season. She had
a reputation as a strong defensive
player when she was recruited,
and Coach Bruce did not hesitate
to use her against some of the top
point guards in the conference.

Lisa Fessler came off the bench
to average 6.1 points a game. She
was noted for her clutch outside
shooting.

“Lisa came off the bench and
had some big games for us,” said
Bruce.

Pitt will lose three seniors, Rita
Anderson and co—captains Lorri
Johnson and Jennifer Shingler.

“Lorri, Jen and Rita showed
leadership,"
“Sometimes we needed a push,
and they provided leadership that
can be attributed to their play on
the court."

Shingler ﬁnished her Pitt career
with 1,081 points and 393 assists.
She is sixth on the al1~time Pitt
scoring list.

Anderson teamed with Shingler
as seniors on the 1986 Altoona
Area High School girl’s team
which won the Pennsylvania state
championship and was voted USA

Moments before the final ﬂoor-
performance score for Lady
Panther Tina Taylor was posted,
the crowd in Trees Hall fell silent.
When the judges raised a score of
9.7, both the crowd and the Lady
Panthers cheered wildly.

With Taylor’s score, which tied
the record score she set a year

ago, the Lady Panthers defeated I

the 1988-89 Division—II National
Champions, the Lady Apaches of
Indiana , University of
Pennsylvania, with their highest
team total of the season last
Sunday.

Pitt scored an impressive
184.35, the third-highest school
score, while IUP scored a 183.00.

The Lady Panthers’ record moved
to 7-11.

“I was really happy,” said
Taylor. “The only thing we wanted
was to win this meet; that’s the
only thing we were going for.

“We were behind for the first
two events, so we were getting a
little nervous there for a second.
Then we came back real strong
on beam and ﬂoor, ” Taylor added.

After the First two events, the
Lady Panthers were trailing by
1.7 points.

It was during the third round,
when Pitt was performing on the
beam and IUP was performing
on the ﬂoor, that the Lady Panthers
began to implement their

comeback. After turning in strong

beam performances of 9.0 and
better, Pitt closed the gap to a
mere four-tenths of a point. .
“I couldn’t have been prouder
of them tonight,” said Pitt head
coach Debbie Yohman. “The

The Lady Panthers opened the

The Pitt squad broke both its
team’s highest ﬂoor score and the
school’s team record by turning
in strong performances to earn a

Staff Writer

During the opening of the last
home meet of E;I‘1iF. season for the
women’s gymnastics team, the
Lady Panthers’ home crowd got
its last look at seniors Hope Celani
and Shelly Sleith.

Both Celani and Sleith were
able to leave their last home meet
with smiles when the Lady
Panthers came from behind to
defeat the Lady Apaches of
Indiana University of
Pennsylvania with a score of
184.55 to 185.00.

Head coach Debbie Yohman
and assistant coach Ben Rovee
presented ﬂowers and four-year
letterman’s blankets.

Both Celani and Sleith said that
they will miss performing at Pitt.

“I always miss the home crowd,”
said Celani. “I also miss the home
order: vault, bar, beam, floor.
When we start on bars first, it’s
like we jump right into a hard
event. Bars are a hard event for
us as a team. but I’m looking
forward to our next three meets.
Hopefully we will finish really
well,’’ she said.

During the meet Celani
performed on bars and scored an
8.55 and exhibition on the vault
and ﬂoor.

During her collegiate career,
Celani’s record was vault (8.9),
bars (8.7), beam (98.7), floor (9.4)
and all-around (34.15).

Celani also earned the Eastern"

College Athletic Conference first-
team All-Conference in 1988 and
received the Lady Panthers’ most
improved gymnast award.

She was also named to the
Athletics Director’s Honor Roll
twice last season.

Sleith performed exhibition on
the beam and scored an 8.85
during last Sunday’s meet. She is
still recovering from a shoulder
injury and has been making great
progress.

“Hopefully it’s not my last beam;
hopefully I’m going to compete
some more,” said Sleith. “I’m just
working my way back in. I don’t

‘Seniors Celani and Smith say goodbye to college gymnastics

expect to get back in the all-
around. I just want to concentrate
on beam right now and maybe
vault. I have three or four more
meets, and I want to get back in
the lineup for that, not just
exhibition. 1 want to get back in
there."

Sleith has performed in the all-
around for the last four years and
said that once you get used to

working three or four events a

day, you miss not doing it.

She also said that she will miss I

the home crowd’s support during
the tail end of the season.

“There's always people you
know at home; your friends from
classes come up just to watch the
meet,” said Sleith. “When you’re
away, you barely have your family
and relatives. Sometimes if it’s far
away, they can’t come, let alone
having the crowd.”

Sleith said that she feels that
the home crowd helps the
performers carry on with their
routines.

“If you go to a place like Penn
State, anybody goes to Penn State
gymnastics meets, because that's
such a big thing up there. And
they start pounding on the
bleachers,” Sleith added.

As last Sunday’s meet was
coming to a close, the crowd
seemed to begin to cheer on the
Pitt squad. ‘

“Toward the end, we really
needed cheering up on ﬂoor,
and after we did ﬂoor, everybody
applauded the routines," said
Sleith. “I think that got the rest of
the team motivated just because
of the crowd showing an interest
in their scores.

“It helped especially at the end
of ﬂoor, because ﬂoor is always
hard to get psyched up on,” she
added.

She was the 1990 and 1988 co- §

captain and was named MVP in
the 1987-88 season. She was
named to the Athletic Director’s
Honor Roll for the 1987 spring
semester. Sleith is also the
recipient of the Myra Bachuchin
Spadafore Memorial Scholarship
for the 1989-90 academic year.
