Pharmacy phase-out
draws swift reaction

By Kathy Campbell
The Pitt News

“They say it’s either sink or swim,
but we intend to fly,“ states John
Hamilton, a third-year pharmacy
student. Hamilton was echoing the
views of most in the School of Phar-
macy after being told Thursday that
his major may soon be “phased out"
of Pitt's system.

“We plan to present the evidence
to the provost again," said Dr. Lewis
W. Dittern, dean of the School of
Pharmacy. “We’re extremely hurt
about this report." Dittern was
speaking to a roomful of news repor-
ters from area television and radio
stations on Friday afternoon. He
had met with the group in order to
inform the public ofthe school's rep-
utation and to let them know that he
was not about to give up the ﬁght.

“The phones have not stopped

ringing," according to Dr. Randy P.
Juhl, chairman of the Department
of Pharmacy Practice. “People who
are enraged by the [possible] closing
have been calling — alumni, state
legislatures and the general public
concerned with what’s been going
on.”
At the meeting, Dittern presented
a fact sheet that refuted nearly every
claim made by the task force. One
such statement concerned the fact
that in October, the School of Phar-
macy signed a formal exchange with
Nanjing College of Pharmacy in
China. This is the first such agree-
ment between a U.S. and a Chinese
school of pharmacy.

Dittern and Juhl also stated that
pharmacists are in demand, men-
tioning a national campaign created
by the National Association of
Chain Drug Stores that elicited a
response from nearly 7,000 high
school students. Presently, the
number of students enrolled in the
pharmacy program is 405 and is
expected to increase to nearly 450 by

The Pittsburgh Press article, “Pitt
Plan Includes Pharmacy School
Phase-out," drew strong responses
from concerned pharmacy students
and current Student Government
Board members at the board's
weekly meeting on Thursday.

A document that included reports
from President Wesley Posvar, Pro-
vost Roger Benjamin and Executive
Vice President Freeman was
released Thursday. It called for a
phasing out of Pitt's School of
Pharmacy. '

Sir Edmund Hillary speaks here about his historic

The pharmacy school was said to
be too costly to operate, that its
quality is below that of many other
units in the university and the level
of sponsored research is low. The
report also said the school is low in
its importance to the mission of the
university.

Jim Glass, a concerned pharmacy
student, responded vehemently to
the news, saying, “The university has
the best thing going here, and they’re
cutting it out.” He pointed to the
high quality of education the phar-
macy students receive, as evidenced
through their 100 percent placement
in the work force.

Referring to the sure placement
percentage Glass said that “no other
major or organization on campus

can do this.” He expressed a fear
certainly felt by fellow students —
that the school’s closing would hurt
their education. Glass said that
although “they more or less guaran-
tee us an education, professors who
know that they won’t have ajob in a
couple of years will leave.” This will
hurt the pharmacy students, Glass
claimed.

Karen Fisher, president of
APHA, said “the educations of stu-
dents in the whole university are
being hurt” because ofthis proposed
plan. She posed a question for the
future: “What will go next?”

Fisher also expressed a concern
that the media, including The Pitt
News, received a copy of the report

before SGB did. “I think SGB
should be made more informed
about things of this nature,” she
said.

Glass and Fisher both said that
the experience SGB has had in deal-
ing with Pitt’s administration— is
much needed. SGB president-elect
Luke Kluchko assured that the new
board will, during its orientation
session, betaling about the issue.
“The new board has until Jan. l5 to
make an official response,” he said.

Current board members Avery
Abrams and Betsy Fitzpatrick
expressed their personal concern on
the issue. Abrams said that he was
personally “disgusted with President
Posvar's report” and that the issue

next fall. Out of those students,
approximately one-half of them are
first-generation college students,
meaning that they probably come
from “modest family backrounds,”
according to Dittern.

On Thursday of last week, Presi-
dent Posvar unveiled the recommen-
dation of a task force headed by
Provost Roger Benjamin to phase
out the School of Pharmacy. The
phase-out is part of the university's
five-year plan to enhance its reputa-
tion by eliminating what it considers
to be its weaker programs. Univer-
sity officials have targeted the Grad-
uate School of International and
Public Affairs (GSPIA), the School
of Education, the School of Health
Related Professions (with the excep-
tion of the Physical Therapy and
Occupational Therapy programs)
and the branch campus in Titusville.

One of the program reductions
would be Child Care and Develop-
ment, but the head ofthat program,
Dr. Nancy Curry, said, “I don’t
think this will happen. The drop in
enrollment that they referred to is
temporary. The demand for child
development specialists will escal-
ate, as it has done in the past.”

Acccording to Curry, the need for
child care specialists is building up
because of instances such as sexual
abuse of children in daycare facili-
ties. Also, there is a growing number
of high-risk babies who may need
care for the rest of their lives. Pitt’s
program trains the graduates in not
only child care for the non-
handicapped but for the handi-
capped child as well. Temple
University is the only other school in
Pennsylvania that offers such
training.

“We strongly question this proce-
dure,“ said Curry. “They’ve pro-
duced a document that is not
data-based. The final report was a
complete surprise.“ .

“I don't think it will happen, ’’con-
cluded Candace Carlin, a junior
Child Care and Development major,
“... at least not for a while ~— I hope!"

with sea  

“must be addressed by the next
board.”

Fitzpatrick commented, “I find it
appalling, too what happens
always seems to hurt the
undergraduates.”

In regular SGB business, Presi-
dent Ken Stram reported he has
been in contact with the Internship
Office and that there are currently
more internships available than

' interested students.

Other reports were that the Fresh-
man Council is working on a new
orientation program for next year
and that the chairmanship for the
Student Relations Committee will
be open next term.

“Ladies and gentlemen, please

' join me in welcoming to Carnegie

Institute the conqueror of Sagarma-
tha, a world-renowned author and
most of all, a remarkable human
being - Sir Edmund Hillary."
Applause burst out with enthusiasm

Wednesday night as the director of

the Musuem of Natural History wel-
comed the 65-year-old New Zea-
lander from Auckland, who, in a
two-man team with Tenzing Nor-
gay, a Sherpa mountain guide, was
the first to ascend Mount Everest.

A tall, youthful-mannered man
came forward and began with an
anecdote that occurred in Australia
a few years ago. An old friend drove
Hillary to a hotel, where a young
woman behind the desk exclaimed
that she had been waiting to meet
him. “Well, I looked at my aging
companion; obviously he wasn’t
such an effect on her; it must be me,”
he remembered. “And I glowed with
manly pride. ‘I was taught about you
in history classes and I was under the
impression that you were dead,‘ she
said.” Hillary is not only very much
alive but still does a lot of mountain
hiking.

His lecture was a part of the “Man
and Ideas” lecture series, now in its
15th year. Hillary took the audience
on a breathtaking trip along the
route the British expedition had tra-

The Pitt i.Mond‘a'y, °De‘cer,n_ber 3',”I198‘4 

veled to reach Mount Everest in
1953.

From those days Hillary
remembers comraderie and team
spirit. “It was certainly teamwork
that got Tenzing and me to the top of
Mount Everest.” One morning, still
in the lower parts of the Himalayas,
Tenzing came to his rescue when he
was about to lose his life. Hillary had
jumped across a crevasse onto a
chunk ofice, “Whereupon the chunk
of ice broke off and dropped into the
crevasse with me on top of it.“ But
Sir Edmund was not really sure if he
felt appreciation for Tenzing’s sav-
ing his life. “Certainly I would be
very annoyed if he [Tenzing] hadn't
saved my life. The thing is that we
were a team, and I expected Tenzing
to carry out the right procedure, as I
would have expected myself to do if
our roles had been reversed.”

The British expedition of 1953
climbed up the glaciers, from base
camp to the next campsite and still
the next, conquering dangerous
walls and ice steps and traverses.
Hillary and Tenzing were teamed
that clear day on May 29, 1953,
when it was their turn to challenge
the world's highest peak. And
finally, there they were, or rather,
there he was — Tenzing on the roof
of the world proudly raising his ice
axe with the British flag tied to it.

But there is no picture of Sir
Edmund on the summit. “As far as I
was aware, he‘>[Tenzing] had never
taken a photograph in his life and we
agreed that the summit was not the
ideal place to give him instructions,"
Hillary said. “No expedition today

would make that sort of mistake. I
was in many ways a country boy and
not really aware of the impact that
the climb of Everest was likely to
have on the public," he added.

“[Each one of us] likes recognition

as individuals, or companies or
groups, and I've certainly been lucky
enough to have more than my
share,” Hillary said of his world-
wide fame. Yet the most treasured
one was that which occurred right
after his ascent to the roof of the
world. He spent a night at the British
Embassy in Katmandu, the capital
of Nepal, as a member of the British
expedition.’ In the morning he was
asked outside for a decoration.
From that day, Sir Edmund remem-
bered: “The whole yard was jammed
with people and motorcars. The
people were not unusupl, but the
cars in those days were because there
was no roadjoining Katmandu with
the outside world.” After many
speeches. and handshakes, Hillary
finally had time to read the inscrip-
tion on his medal: “On top it said.
‘Presented to the Conqueror of
Everest,’ and on the bottom, ‘By the
Katmandu Taxi Driver Associa-
tion.‘ ”

Since his ascent to Mount Everest
came in time for the coronation of
Elizabeth II as queen of England,
she knighted him Sir Edmund in
return for the one-of-a-kind corona-
tion gift.

As he led the audience across vil-

lages with his humorous narrative,

Sir Edmund talked about the dis-
comforts of the monsoon season in
Nepal: “People are not very enthusi-

   

 

astic about leeches. They don't do
you any particular harm. After a
while you get accustomed to remov-
ing your shoes, taking off your
socks, wringing out the blood and
putting your socks back on again."

His adventure in Nepal did not
end with his ascent to Everest; it
became life-long. Hillary became
deeply involved in the lives of the
people of Nepal. He realized that as
the new climbers swept the slopes.
following his footsteps, they
brought new culture into the iso-
lated country. He had to do some-
thing to soften the impact of outside
civilization tearing its way into the
simple lives of the Nepalese. So, in
1961, he built a first school. “I
thought that it would be the last
thing I would be doing here,” he
said, “[but] people kept coming
from village after village requesting
in their turn_ that we work with them
on building other schools.”

Also, he started promoting build-
ing of hospitals. These provide two
volunteer doctors who deal with
quite different problems; one is
goiter, frequently found there. Doc-
tors are required to have some
knowledge of dentistry as well: “We
feel that at least it enables them to
decide which tooth it is that needs

removed and, of course, which pair -

of pliers is most suitable for wrench-
ing it out." . ‘

In a newly finished hospital, .a
solar battery heats water. “Inside the
doctors’ parlor we also have a hot
shower. We believe that this is the
‘best hot shower in the whole of East
Nepal; in fact, it may well be the only

 

ghest summit

hot shower in East Nepal," Hillary"
said with pride. —

The opening ceremonies follow
each finishing ofa building. The vil-
lage elders honor Hillary each with
three glasses-full of local spirits.
“[This is] pretty fiery stuff," Hillary
admitted; “Now that I have found
that after dozen or so elders that I
am in a very jovial frame of mind,
indeed, and at this stage —— Sherpas
are no fools, you know — they often
come forward and present the peti-
tion requesting some new structure
[to be built].”

After the elders come the children,
who are to Hillary “quite delight-
ful,” and they present him with long
necklaces made of magnolia flowers.
“At the conclusion of all the children
coming forward, you really do look
a little bit on the unusual side," Hil-
lary commented on a slide showing
him and Tenzing covered up to their
eyes with chains of flowers mount-
ing up on their chests.

In reflecting on his adventurous
life, Sir Edmund said, “Of all the

things in which I’ve been involved, '

the most rewarding thing of all has
been these activities with the people
of Himalayas -4 the building of
schools and hospitals, and giving of
the opportunity for the young peo-
ple to lead a fuller and better life."

And his ascent of Mount Everest
had been only the beginning. He
challenged many mountains since,
led an expedition to the South Pole
and explored the Himalayan rivers
by jet boat. Nothing else, but a truly
remarkable human being.

Nicaragua called

‘ant-sized’ to US.

By Jill Colamarlno
The Pitt News

“Nicaragua: Two Perspectives —
Self-Determination or Foreign
Intervention,” was the topic of
Thursday's GSPIA Noon Collo-
quium held in Forbes Quadrangle.

‘ “How does a large power like the
U.S. deal with a small power like
Nicaragua when they're so close to
each other?” and “How do we find
out what’s really going on down
there?” asked Robert Norman, asso-
ciate professor, GSPIA.

Norman, who recently spent three
weeks in war areas of Nicaragua,
discussed the nature of big power /
small power relationships. He com-
pared the U.S. and Nicaragua to“an

J elephant and an ant.”

Other issues that Norman dis-
cussed included the air raid on Santa
Clara in which two Americans were
killed, the “alleged” 'arms flow
between Nicaragua and El Salvador, ‘P
the recent Nicaraguan elections,
which the U.S. called “broad and
fair,” and “official terrorism.”

Norman said there may be some
misrepresentation of I Nicaraguan
affairs by the U.S. media, “partly
because of the (Nicaraguan) Marx-
ist/ Leninist government and partly
because of the size difference.”

According to Norman, Nicaragua
is a very religious country. “The U.S.
is more afraid of a Christian revolu-
tion than a Marxist/ Leninist revolu-
tion," he said.

Also participating in the collo-
quium was history professor Harold

Sims, whose discussion concen- ’
trated on the role of the U.S.S.R. in

Nicaragua and its long-range aid
program. The Soviets, according to
Sims, are making provisions of
arms, food and oil. Sims said that
the U.S.S.R. provides most of Nica-
ragua‘s arms and more that 60 per-
cent of its oil.

How is Nicaragua paying for
those provisions?

“We don’t know,"said Sims. “The
Soviets won't say,Nicaragua won’t
say.”

According to Norman, Nicara-
gua’s yearly national income is
about $600 million — approxi-
mately Pitt's budget for two years.

Cuba, a Soviet bloc country, has
been providing Nicaragua with
teachers, doctors and military advi-
sors, said Sims. He called the
involvement of some Nicaraguan
officials in Cuban cocaine traffic a
“curious development."

“Rebels are helping finance the
revolution by selling cocaine,” Sims
said.

Sims also said that the increase in
the number and types of trips to
Soviet bloc countries by Nicaraguan
leaders was an “indication of inti-
mate ties” between the two
countries.

Following Sims’ and Norman’s
presentations, questions from the

audience led to discussions concern- .

ing leftist groups, private sector

investments and the effect of the war.

on Nicaragua’s economy.

When Sims was asked if he felt
Nicaragua was copying the Cuban
struggle, he replied, “Well, it wasn't
a Cuban-style election, it was a
multi-party election  I see it as a
Nicaraguan variant of the Cuban
revolution.”

(UPI) —— Officials of the
Duquesne Light Company
declared an unusual event Satur-
day at the company's Beaver Val-
ley power station unit number
one, located in Shippingport.

An unusual event is declared
when an abnormal occurrence is
detected in the plant. It does not
mean there is an immediate
threat to public health and
safety.

The event was declared at
12:34 p.m. when a small amount
of contaminated material was
discovered on a Duquesne Light
Company employee’s clothing as
the result of an injury in a fall
earlier Saturday. if

The employee sustained minor
injuries while performing minor
duties near the reactor contain’-
ment area. He was treated at the
scene and taken to Aliquippa
hospital for further treatment.

The unusual event was over at
1:32 p.m.

The power station has been

out of service since Oct. 11 for a"

scheduled refueling.

(UPI) — Salvadoran Presi-
dent Jose Napoleon Duarte said
he wants that country’s leftist
rebels to give him a “sign of good

1 faith” before he agrees to a.

further peace meeting. Duarte’s
comment is taken as meaning the
government wants a halt in guer-
illa activity during the holiday
period. At a news conference

Saturday, he accused the rebels ‘

of not being sincere about peace.

most popular songs, started as a

Julian Lennon when his parents
divorced in 1968. John Lennon‘s
son is now 21 and recently
released his first album. Julian
Lennon said he actually didn’t
know “Hey Jude” was written for
him until two years ago. Said
Lennon, “I was shocked, but it’s
nice to be connected to a song
that's such a classic." Lennon’s
voice and appearance are strik-
ingly similar to his late father’s,
but he said he wouldn't mind the
comparisons if they weren’t so
redundant.

(UPI) — The Soviet Union has
charged that two Russian sol-
diers in Afghanistan who
defected to Britain but later
returned to Moscow were kid-
napped, drugged and forced to
defect. A Soviet newspaper
quoted the soldiers as saying they
regard the experience as “a
nightmare.” _

(UPI) — Former president

_Jimmy Carter said he kept a

diary during his four years in the
White House, recording sensitive
details about world leaders who
passed through the Oval. Office.
Carter said he wrote in the diary
“every night" and it was about
6,000 pages long when he left
office. But he said neither the
general public not scholars will
have access to the diaryvwhen the

One of the first stops on the
itinerary was a visit to Block’s
hog, corn and soybean farm in
Illinois.

Last week, Block decided to
release 33,000 tons of ‘wheat from

The wheat is part of a four-

Sexcrime

Western Pennsylvania legislators in the House and Senate voted
last week to make it a crime for a husband to force his wife to have
sexual intercourse against her will. This crime, called spousal sexual
assault, will be punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Feminists are
likely to applaud this piece of legislation as a major step toward the
realization of women‘s rights. It may be applauded, that is, if the crime
as stated can be proven in a court of law to have been committed.

Since married couples normally maintain a rather high degree of
privacy about their sexual lives, the argument over whether sexual
assault has been committed is a one-on-one battle. The circumstances

When two adults marry, it is generally the case that they share a
sexual relationship. If a husband sexually assaults his wife, she has the
available option of divorce. Spousal sexual assault may be adequate
grounds for divorce, but to make it a crime by some vague definition,
punishable by up to I0 years in prison, simply allows a woman to share
the economic advantages of an unhappy marriage while her husband

sits in jail.

Roles of husband and wife are no longer clear. In some cases this
may be a great advance in personal growth. The demands of women
are, however, becoming confusing and at times are simply absurd.
Many married women complain when their husbands are unfaithful
and yet now want the extreme option of being able to determine when
and how often they and their husbands have sex. Ifa husband and wife
cannot solve their sexual problems out of court, they should not be

married.

This piece of legislation seems unfair to men, as it does not deﬁne
the circumstances of such a crime. If a husband forces his wife into a
sex act through beating or the use of a weapon, most of us can agree
that a crime has been committed. Since the act has not been defined as
rape, it cannot be treated as rape in court. We hope this potential piece
of law is re-examined and redefined before it is offered for abuse.

Father, Son
and Union

. A house divided cannot stand. Yet Charles Honeywell, the strate-
gist behind the Network to Save the Mon/ Ohio Valley and the
Denominational Ministry Strategy, believes that the controversial
preaching tactics of the Rev. D. _Douglas Roth are effective because of
the resultant divided congregation of the Clairton Trinity Lutheran
Church. Honeywell believes it essential to use “tactics to upset society
and polarize evil and good.” And the church's seven-member council
has the audacity to suggest that these tactics are “going strictly by

Jesus‘ teachings."

. Meanwhile, the Lutheran synod dismissed Roth as pastor, has
declared the congregation “defunct" and is disallowing the members
to elect a church council. There is something very peculiar about this
situation. We have a militant, socialist minister lashing out at corpo-

. rate survival tactics to a congregation that wants to better their
understanding of the teachings of Christ, something about peace, love

and tolerance.

Division of church and state? Freedom of assembly? What is going
on here? Certainly nothing Jesus Christ would advocate. The DMS
defines itself as a prophetic ministry devoted to “caring and meeting
needs." Honeywell was hired to help the DMS plan community
outreach programs. It has been pointed out, however, that DMS
neither feeds nor clothes the poor. None of its monies are spent on
direct assistance to the unemployed.

The Rev. Montgomery 0. Bowser, on the other hand, is currently
attempting to dissolve the violent atmosphere plaguing the church and
is encouraging members of the congregation “to go forward and live in
the love of God. Sounds like what a man of faith should be doing, '
spreading a message of peace. Unfortunately, he's been sprayed with
shaving cream, has had his car splashed with red paint and has been

’ met with pbscenities.

The Christian faith claims that we are all children of God. If God be
a wise parent, let him take an old-fashioned strap to the hides of these
unruly youngsters in order to teach them to “do unto others" and to
keep their itchy fingers folded in prayer and out of union politics.

The administration of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, like a rogue ele-
phant, is out of control, beyond
faculty influence and arrogantly
insensitive to the concerns of the
faculty, student body and staff.

Ironically, as we prepare for the
university’s bicentennial in 1986,
there is a deep and widespread lack
of respect and distrust of the Posvar
administration among alumni,
faculty, students and staff. And
there is good reason for these nega-
tive feelings. '

Firstly, without interviewing ‘a
single person for the position of Vice
Chancellor of the Health Profes-
sions, Posvar appointed an insider
for the job. The so-called search
committee provided no more than
window dressing to camouﬂage Dr.
Posvar’s hidden agenda. In view of
the ineffectiveness of the last three
deans in the medical school, all
hand-picked by Dr. Posvar, the lack
of a comprehensive and open search
for administrators in the School of
Medicine and elsewhere should
make us all apprehensive about the
wisdom and judgment of the presi-
dent of the university. '

Secondly, the disgraceful man-
handling of the GSPIA and School
of Education by Posvar and Provost
Benjamin merits attention. The pro-
vost’s unfortunate proclivity to reply
in insulting language when ques-
tioned by sincere and thoughtful stu-
dents and faculty is unbecoming. It
took the administration five years to
rub out the “ugly spot“‘cailed the
Geography department. How long
will it take them to “absorb”GSPlA
and weed out the “deadwood“ in the
School of Education?

Thirdly, President Posvar has yet
to bring the multimillion dollar
medical practice plans of the clinical
departments of the School of Medi-
cine under control and sensible
faculty governance. Nor has he an-
swered questions of the Pratt Sub-
committee of the Budget and

Policies Committee of the Faculty
Senate.

While the practice plans continue
to be largely unaccountable, Dr.
Posvar continues to give millions of
dollars from the undergraduate tui-
tion to the School of Medicine.
Would the pressure on GSPIA and
the School of Education be so great
if Posvar had brought the ﬁnances
of the prodigal clinical departments
under control? ‘ V

‘It is noteworthy that Dr. Ben,-.

 

  



made up in part by funds derived
from undergraduate tuition.
Provost Benjamin has acknowl-
edged publicly that a mechanism
must be found to make the $40 mil-
lion practice plans of the School of
Medicine accountable to the univer-
sity administration. Many thought-
ful people who care about the
University of Pittsburgh believe that
no discussion of the provost’s docu-
ment, “The University Plan I985-
l990,” should occur until the
financial hemmorhage caused by the
clinical practice plans is stemmed.
To-act on or discuss a single recom-
mendation in the provost’s docu-
ment without analyzing the

profound deficiencies in leadership _

and fiscal management that have
brought the university to this crisis
would be like rearranging deck
chairs on the Titanic.

Fourthly, the hiring practices in
the School of Medicine are an insult
to the democratic principles of open
and honest recruiting. There is evi-
dence that the vice chancellor, with-
out advertising the position, has
already selected an associate clean to
replace Dr. Robert Olson, who was
fired for challenging loose adminis-
trative practices. Dishonest hiring
practices tend‘ to become self-
perpetuating, so it should not shock
anyone to learn that department
heads are being instructed as to
whom they must hire to satisfy the
demands of an incoming associate
dean in the School of Medicine. It is
reported that this candidate will not
take up his position unless he gets his
prerequisites.

__ Fifthly, when Dr. Posvar became

measure to the intolerance and arro-
gance of Dr. Posvar and his admin-
istrators for democratic principles.
Finally, with increasing fre-
quency, the Posvar administration
resorts to ﬂagrant intimidation to
silence criticism and discourage dis-
sidents. Witness how a $2 million

nutrition grant from the Heinz"

Foundation that Dr. Olson had
earned wasxxtaken from him and
returned to the foundation. Posvar
has found an effective way to neu-

tralize dissenters among the faculty -

—_— threaten to take away their grants
so asto prevent themfrom doing
research and practicing their profes-
sion. This manipulative . behavior
has a chilling effect on the faculty; it
squelches legitimate debate and dis-
cussion about how the resources of
the university should be most wisely
and efficiently used and how
inﬂuential academic and adminis-
trative positions are to be filled.

In Nigeria’ there is an expression
“No condition is permanent!” The
present administration will surely
change one day, but in the meantime
Dr. Posvar and his appointees can
do incalculable damage to the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. The damage
will persist long after he has left his
post, unless the faculty, students,

' alumni and staff band together at

every level to bringthis administra-
tion under control. Are the members
of the Board -of Trustees aware of the
problems here; how will they face

their responsiblities?

Hi-Tech‘
Hogwash

It is with both interest and disgust

. that I read about the university’s

plans for GSPIA and the School of
Pharmacy. The interest? Any major
change in a university of this size not
only affects the students here but
students elsewhere, due to the size
and prominence of the university.
The disgust? The schools being
phased out are top-quality and
nationally known. And to where is
the money being transferred? A size-
able portion is being used to beef up
the high-tech resources of the
School of Engineering and compu-
ter science department. ’ ' '

As a computer science major, I
can appreciate the university's desire
to improve the computer science
department. But to do it at the
expense of two schools that have
given Pitt a good reputation is akin
to killing the healthy sons to save the
severely ill one. And the computer
science department is severely ill.

‘Judging from reactions of fellow

classmates, I would not be alone in
saying that buying more hardware
would not be the solution to the
department’s problems. What the
department needs are some good
teachers instead of professors
wrapped up in research. There are
some good professors in the depart-

. ment, but they are few. In fact, one

professor was let go in spite of a
petition from students in her classes

, to keep her. On the other hand, pro-

fessors who basically regurgitate the
textbook are kept on term after term
despite the complaints of "students
who are forced to teach themselves
the material or rely on the assistance
of someone who’s already “gotten
through” the class. It is this in which
the university chooses to invest?

In all the promotional material —
the chancellor’s report, the -page
about the university in the sports
programs — Pitt’s commitment to
learning is stressed again and again.
Is phasing out two entire schools
improving the quality of education
at Pitt? Fine, the computer science
department needs money, and the
university is trying to establish itself
as a computer science school. But
state-of-the-art equipment is not the
panacea for which the university
seems to be searching.

One gets the impression that Pres-
ident Posvar and company are in the
process of turning Pitt from a uni-
versity into a technical institute.
What’s next, the philosophy
department?

Hostile Library

This past week, I had the unfortu-
nateexperience of walking into Hill-
man Library to try to get some stud-
ying done. I figured that since finals
were a mere week away, this was an

,,/opportune time for me to take

advantage of a few free hours to get
prepared for exams.

Unfortunately, studying would

not be in store for me on this day in
Hillman. I found that the students
around me were doing everything
but what they should be doing.
Groups of kids were gathered at
tables gabbing away, friends were
shouting across the room to get the
attention of someone else and laugh-
ter was constantly ringing from peo-
ple’s mouths. Bags of food were
strewn across tables as well as soda
and munchies as if it were a cafete-
ria. I was befuddled. Was I in a
library? Apparently not; at least I
couldn’t classify it as such.

A library is not a place for social-
izing, nor is it a place for yelling and
screaming as if you are at a ball-
game. A library is where one goes to
study, to gather his thoughts, but
most importantly to become
enriched through books. It is a place
to learn. If you want to talk or yell at
your friends, the Student Union is
the place for you. There you can talk
all you want and as loud as you
want.

From Where I Stand  Vincent Murphy

The Ministry of Lies’ Five-Year Plan

And so, the ad ministration’s reck-
less purge continues. After the
announcement of the proposal to
dissolve GSPIA and Provost Ben-
jamin’s assurance that we had only
seen the beginnings of a bold five-
year reorganization plan, programs
assessed this year by the provost‘s
task-force waited silently for
another grim announcement. Ben-
jamin’s poor handling of an expla-
nation of the GSPIA proposal
seemed to leave enough controversy
as to the motives in the administra-
tion’s ominous “Five—year Plan.”

One could have been led to believe
that both the president and the pro-
vost would tone down any further
earth-shattering announcements
until they had successfully con-
vinced the faculty and the students,
for whom they work, that they could
give detailed, logical explanations of
the task forcels findings and the
long-term benefits of reorganizing
some of the best ‘programs in the
university. With regrettable bold-
ness, however, President Posvar,
only two weeks after the GSPIA
announcement, pointed another
accusing finger at the School of
Pharmacy. So for all of you idealists
who expected at least a month to

catch your breath (or, at least in the
near future, only a slight clamor now
and then with a few ofthe less prom-
inent programs at Pitt), you have

underestimated the omnipotence of '

our administration. They are not
afraid of controversy.

The word “purge" in reference to
the Five-year Plan has become com-
mon among students in the humani-
ties since the GSPIA proposal on
Nov. 8. Admittedly, lack of evidence

- provingany intention in the pro-

vost‘s office of effectively eliminat-
ing “unwanted“ faculty makes the
use of terminology such as “purge”
slightly extreme. A lack of evidence
and explanation to support the" task
force findings also exists, though.
Among the university communi-
ty, an» obvious’ controversy sur-
rounds the provost‘s intentions. A
specific demand for concrete argu-
ments supporting the reorganization
plan, which strikes us lowly non-
administratives as only detrimental
to the reputation of the university, is
natural. Neither the president nor
the provost must have thought so
when preparing to announce their
reorganization plans,’ however.
They obviously felt that it was just as
natural for the administration to

have no concrete excuses for their
actions. This was obvious in Provost
Benjamin’s defiantly empty talk
with GSPIA students on Nov. 10.
Was the administration surprised,
though, or even slightly threatened

"by the doubts in its credibility that

arose among students and faculty
after the GSPIA incident?
Obviously not. In fact, President
Posvar seems to feel very little need
to be concerned about any confu-
sion in the university community.
After all, Wesley Posvar is the presi-
dent of this university, and if he felt
like announcing to the university
last Thursday the need to phase out
yet another reputable program at
Pitt —— the School of Pharmacy -
we shouldnot question his motives,
right?

Taking a look at the reputation of
Pitt's School of Pharmacy, we come
across the same questions as with
GSPIA as to why it had been singled
out. Pitt's School of Pharmacy is
one of four in the state of Pennsylva-
nia and is accredited. by the Ameri-
can Council of Pharmaceutical
Education as “one of the best in the
nation.” In explaining his motives,
President Posvar gives us some of

the incomprehensibly contradictory

‘(remarks that were so common in

Roger Benjamin's dealings with
GSPIA. “We have a dozen areas of
strength? that bring us national and
world recognition,” stated Posvar
concerning programs at Pitt he
would strive to strengthen. About
the School of Pharmacy, however,
he adds, “certain question have been
raised about low productivity and
the quality of research withinthe
school." ' I

GSPIA and the School of Phar-
macy were two programs in the
“dozen areas of strength that bring
us world recognition.” They were —
until the administration effectively
destroyed their reputation with
announcements of task-force survey
results that have been called either
inaccurate or irrelevant. Sugges-
tions that the provost's intentions lie
more on the line of a vendetta
against certain faculty members
than in any real concern for the
future of the university may only be
unfounded accusations. The admin-
istration’s inability to convince us
otherwise, however, leaves the
faculty and students at Pitt little
choice but to believe the worst.

The Pitt News, Monday, December 3, I984

Reagan called as popular to youth as ‘Indiana Jones’

(USPS) — Ronald Reagan cap-
tured more than 65 percent ofthe I8-
to 24-year-old vote because he is as
popular as the hero from “Raiders of
the Lost Ark,” according to the
director of I984 Youth for
Reagan/ Bush.

“Ronald Reagan is like Indiana
Jones to these kids," Liz Pickens
said. “No problem is too big for him.
It all comes down to strong
leadership."

Pickens knows something about
leadership herself. Before heading
Youth for Reagan/Bush, the 24-
year-old Pickens managed the I982
state youth campaign for former
Texas governor Bill Clements. Last
February, Youth for Reagan/Bush
was organized under her direction
and began to coordinate what would
become a 100,000-member Republi-
can youth campaign across the

country. The primary responsibility

of these young conservative activists
was voter registration.

“Our major contribution to the
campaign was registering voters,”
Pickens said. “We registered 264,987
voters in five weeks.”

Youth for Reagan/Bush also
organized and attended political ral-
lies, worked on fundraising phone
banks and held floor demonstra-
tions at the Republican National
Convention in Dallas. Working with
a $300,000 budget, Youth for Rea-
gan/Bush printed and distributed
buttons, bumper stickers, posters
and countless pieces of campaign
literature to more than two million
individuals and 1.2 million homes.

Youth were the hidden story of
the campaign,” Pickens said. “We
were in a unique position because of
this president.”And Reagan was in a
unique position to receive the adula-
tion — and votes — of a generation
who has seemingly found a real-life
hero.

Pickens believes that Reagan
appealed to youth because of his
ability as a strong leader. “Nobody
can measure up to Ronald Reagan,”
Pickens said. “He’s probably the
strongest president we’ll see in our
lifetime.”

Another reason for Reagan’s pop-
ularity with youth is the country’s
current economic prosperity.

were humiliated internationally, and
our economic situation was bleak.
Under Reagan, there's a resurgence
in national pride. People feel good
about themselves again.”

Youth appear to be more inter-
ested in politics today than in the
past few years, according to Pickens.
“There is a different type of interest
in politics today on the part of
youth,” Pickens said. “In the past,
students were vociferous, but they
didn't vote. Reagan has really done
something to get them to the polls.”

Reagan made evident his ability
to get out the youth vote on election
night. According to a CBS exit poll,
Reagan received 64 percent of young
people’s votes. _

Pickens said she sees today’s
youth as simultaneously conserva-
tive and liberal in politics. “Youth
are libertarian in nature — fiscally
conservative, but socially liberal,"
Pickens said. “They may not agree
with Reagan’s stand on abortion,
but economically they back him.
The good outweighs the bad.

“I got so tired of hearing Ferraro
complain about youth as the ‘me
generation,’ ” Picker'i's continued.
“Today's youth are concerned with
finding a job, raising a family.
They’re not selﬁsh; they just want to
follow the American dream. They
want to be able to have the same

campaign were the unity ofthe party
and the strength and size of the
youth movement,” Pickens said.
Because of the ‘power the youth
have, she advised the GOP to utilize
the new Republican youth group.
“Somebody, maybe someone from
the Republican National Commit-
tee, has to focus on this youth,"
Pickens said. “They’re the future of
this country."

Pickens said she thinks the recent
rise in support by youth for Reagan
and other conservatives is sympto-
matic of a political realignment.
However, she said, “The real test of
the realignment will be in 1988.”
Pickens said she was optimistic that
youth will once again support the
Republicans in the next presidential
race. A

“This year we planted a seed with
Reagan so it will no longer be alien
for youth to vote Republican,”
Pickens said. “If the first time stu-
dents vote, they pull the lever
[marked] ‘Republican,’ hopefully
they’re starting a trend that will
continue.”

“Each time that they vote,"
Pickens continued, “they’ll be

Bill Kicinski played well defensively against WVU Saturday.

By Kirsten Gostony

The Pitt N¢W3 “It was an exhibition of top-

_notch wrestling, which
inspired our guys and has
challenged them to reach new
goals.”

The Panther wrestling team
returned home from the Penn State
invitational having gained knowl-
edge and experience, and brought a
total of 20 match victories and two
place winners. --

“The tournament was of top-
ﬂight performances,” said head
coach Rande Stottlemyer. “It was

and now they've seen it first-hand.”

The Panther’s received excellent
performances from team members
Kyle Nellis and Ken Hackman. Co-

really a great experience for our
guys. _ _
“The guys have been practicing
for quite some time now, and the
practicing can kind of get stale. This
tournament has opened the guys‘
eyes and made them realize how far
we have to go and that the effort and
hard work is what will get us there.”
When competing against top-
ranked opponents, the wrestlers can
only hope to learn from their expe-
rience; and learn they did. “The
benefit of the tournament is that it
exposed and confirmed the needs of
our wrestlers," said assistant coach

Pitt starts slow, but wins

By Mary Wolf
The Pitt News

The Pitt hockey team returned
home with a 5-3,win Saturday after
overcoming the Mountaineers in the
third period of play at Morgantown.

The fans at WVU were behind the
Mountaineers all the way. “The
crowd influenced their players quite
a lot and really had them going,"
said defenseman Bill Kicinski. WVU
came out ready to play hard but Pitt
started out slow. “We have a ten-
dency to play a little ﬂat and casual
on road games,” confessed center
Jim Godwin.

By the end of the first period, the
Panthers were down by one goal.
They came out skating with more
intensity in the second period,
adding two more goals and ending
the period with the score tied at
three, but the Pitt skaters didn’t
think they were playing as well as

growing pains coming into colle-
giate competition," added Spates.
“They almost have to get worse

- before they get better. They have to

drop ineffective habits and start
working on new techniques, and
whenever you try something new
you aren’t as confident about your-
self. Ken did a nicejob but still has a
lot to learn."

The »Panther’s also received fine
performances from Curt Conner,
Gary Bolin and Steve Frank. At 190
lbs., Conner finished the tourna-
ment with a record of 4-2. Bolin,
wrestling at 150 lbs., won three
matches and lost two. Frank ﬁn-
ished 2-2 at 142 lbs.

Only one of the Panther’s suffered
a disappointing injury. After having
won his first two matches, Joe Bond
was forced to withdraw because of a
rib injury.

“All in all, we sawsorne good
things,” concluded Spates. “It was
really the toughest beginning-season
tournament in the country. It was an
exhibition of top-notch wrestling,
which inspired our guys and has
challenged them to reach new
goals.”

they could. “We were mad because
we knew we could play better," said
left wing Jim Owens Jr. “We knew it
would be a big lift for our team to
pull out this game, so we came out
ﬂying in~the third period.”

Pitt was determined not to let
WVU get the best of them and they
began to take command of the game.
Jim Godwin scored the game-
winning goal from Jim Lang with
about five minutes left in the third
period. “Lang worked the puck into
the zone and passed it back to me at
the point and I slid it in past the
goalie," explained Godwin. Lang,

3 who leads the league in points, came

back to score a final insurance goal
from Roger Oldaker with about 1:15
left to play. “On that last goal Roger
made the whole play; I just slipped it
in,” said Lang.

The Panther defense kept their
composure and played a powerful
game for Pitt, holding up well under
the Mountaineer pressure. “Our
defense held us in the game when we
were struggling. Hugo and Kicinski
played really well," said Lang. Vic
Hugo received star of the game for

his outstanding defensive efforts.

Goalies Bob Matioli and Godwin
split Saturday’s game and both did
an excellent job of defending Pitt's
net. Matiolihad l0 saves for 12 shots
on goal and Godwin had ll saves
with 12 shots on goal. “Godwin
played goal like I know he can play
goal. All the shots on him were point
blank and he did a great job stop-
ping the puck," said Lang. Godwin
also received “star of the game”
along with Hugo.

Although Pitt pulled off the win
this weekend, the skaters are not
very pleased with the way they
played. “I think the team realized
right now that we played poorly at
WVU and We’re going to have to
play better if we expect to beat
Duquesne," said left wing Tom Dief-
fenbach. The Panthers will play
Duquesne next Sunday at Lakevue.

Puck Stuff: Both Pitt and WVU
were plagued with penalties Satur-
day. Pitt had 30 minutes and WVU
24’minutes in penalties.

Left wing John Murphy will play
his last game for Pitt next Sunday"
against Duquesne because he is
graduating this month.

Season spawns ill-humor

By Mark A. Slndler
The Pitt News

In terms of humor, Pitt’s football
season ran the gamut from sublime
jokes to comic fatalism, after a 3-7-1
record quickly erased 12 previous
years of glory. _

The tragedy of it all occupied
many a thought. For instance, take
— please — coach Foge Fazio. It
seems that ever since Fazio, eve-
ryone’s favorite hair salon customer,
took an assistant position here in
1977, he’s been trotting six miles a
day. That is, until a couple seasons
ago, when he cut the mileage in half.
“This is the worst shape I've been in
in my life," Fazio said last week.
“Maybe that's why we lost [the
season]."

With today‘s humor out of the
way, items of real substance take
precedence. First start with four of
Fazio’s aides getting axed. To date
Carmen Grosso (tight ends), Don
Thompson (defensive line), Kent
Schoolfield (wide receivers) and Bob
LaCivita (recruiting coordinator)
join the ranks of our nation’s

, unemployed.

Next we turn to the many ill-
conceived rearrangements brought
on when the first four games went
down the tubes. After that there
appeared the possibility of falling

victim to parity and separating
excuse from fact when discussing
injuries. Lest it be forgotten, Black
Wednesday somehow fits into this
busted scenario.

“I’m disappointed with the fact
that in the Temple game and some
other games we maybe should‘ve
just stuck with what we did; it
doesn‘t matter who the QB is," Fazio
said. “If we were going to fail, we
were going to fail that way. We
changed some things around to try
to adapt to the quarterback and that
hurt us. But after the Miami game
we just said the hell with it, we're just
going to play football, and whoever
the quarterback is is going to have to
execute what we know best."

The 27-7 loss to the Hurricanes
left Pitt at 1-6, not exactly conducive
to any quarterback’s aspirations.
Junior John Congemi assuredly
took the brunt of everything, physi-
cally and statistically. Ever since
Congemi suffered a stress fracture in
his foot on the first Wednesday of
fall camp (the same day that Bill

Fralic suffered a concussion and.

tight end Clint Wilson broke a foot
that led to his redshirt), he only man-
aged to play in three full games. His
53.4 percent passing amounted to
l,l02 yards, nine touchdowns and
seven interceptions. ,

His oft-used replacements, Chris
Jelic (47.3 percent, 480 yards, seven

   

interceptions) and John Cummings
(37.5 percent and only eight pass
chances against Temple) helped
matters none.

“Anytime
inconsistent, hurt or not in there,
Fazio said, “your team reflects his
personality. Any coach, when he
starts losing a few games, is going to
change things around. You have to
be very careful you don’t panic and
make wholesale changes. You just
can‘t do that in the middle of the
year. We tried to do subtle things
and I've talked to other coaches
about it. Then you realize, hey, let’s.
just go back to the things we’ve been
doing.”

The myriad of changes, of course,
resulted from a myriad of injuries.
Wilson, a starter, joined offensive
guards Greg Christy and Mike
Dorundo, flanker Dwayne Milloy,
end Chris Doleman, tackles Tony
Woods and Lorenzo Freeman and
fullbacks Marlon Mclntyre and
Marc Bailey as the disabled list
rolled off like toilet tissue.

Obviously most of these injuries
befell starters and were concen-
trated, rather than evenly spread
about. But are injuries part of the
game, just as gusts of wind, or are
they valid excuses?

“I don’t know how to. strike a bal-
ance,” Fazio answered. “Only thing
I know is it’s black and white.”

Fazio has been working in the
dark ever since that fourth day of
camp, most remembered‘ for Fralic’s
inexplicable distancing himself from
others after being kicked in the
helmet. ‘

“Instead of us saying the heck
with it and just proceeding and still

Women run over" by ODU

By Jim (Irban
The Pitt News

-. The Pitt women’s basketball team
brought back a third-place finish
from the Northwestern Tournament
over the weekend. Coach Judy Saur-
er’s squad bounced back from an 89-
64 loss to Old Dominion on Friday
night to defeat Utah 74-50 on Satur-
day and clinch the third-place finish.

Old Dominion, the top-ranked
team in the nation, used 29 points
from junior Dawn Cullen as it

jumped out to an early first-half lead -

and never looked back. Pitt played
even with the Lady Monarchs the
second half, but the margin was too
big to overcome. “We could have
played better than we did,” said
senior Stephanie Collins. .

Saurer, agreed. “There were some
errors made early on. The score
could have been a little closer.” Pitt

was led by Kim Gannis, who scored ,

17 points off the bench, and Jennifer
Bruce added I l points. i

The outstanding performance of
the game was turned in by Lisa
Fubio. The 5-9 junior held Old
Dominion All-America Medina
Dixon tojust 4 points. Dixon is one
of the more prolific scorers in the
college ranks. She averaged over 20
ppg last year. i

As much of a disappointment as
Friday was, Saturday salvaged the
weekend. The Lady Panthers came
together for a total team effort in
defeating Utah. Saurer started a
smaller lineup, but what she lost in
size, she gained in offense. Senior
Ellen Gilhooley replaced Jenny
Tyner in the lineup and fired in 16
points while pulling down 9
rebounds.

Jennifer Bruce led all scorers with

» 19, followed by Gilhooley, Collins

with 13 and Fubio with 10.‘ Collins
and Fubio each picked up 4 steals,
and junior guard Kim Tirik contrib-
uted 12 assists. The Panthers shot a
combined 61 percent from the field
against Utah. Saurer was happy:
“We played a lot better on
Saturday.”

T-Overs
lead “X”
over Pitt

By Mark A. Sindler

The Pitt News.

Only three opening minutes had
gone by on the board, and there was
Curtis Aiken having himself a seat
on the sidelines, unable to break a
sweat. The Panthers starting point
guard, replaced by a freshman?

As much as that did not seem
right, everything had gone wrong
Saturday night at Fitzgerald Field

House. The Panthers, in all their

haste, were suddenly mortal at 1-1
and never found patience a virtue,
dropping a 61-58 basketball game to
Xavier.

Once out of the gate, Pitt
mounted turnover after turnover
upon itself, shoveling the ball away
on its first eight possessions. In
between there, Aiken struggled with
his ballhandling, committing a
costly turnover — the Panthers
totalled 17 by intermission, 24 over-
all. In trotted sub Demetreus Gore,
and nearly four minutes after tipoff,
he became the first Panther to score.

“Wejust wanted tojump on top of
them right away,” Aiken said. “We
were just looking for our shots too
early.”

“We were just forcing everything,
were really careless with the ball and
just didn’t play good,” said Gore,
adding some more of the emphasis.

After taking in the deadbeat first
half, Coach Roy Chipman found the
resolve that,led to Pitt’s short-lived,
one-point lead (45-44) coming on
the heels of a 32-20 locker room
deficit. At the time, center Keith
Armstrong had only four points, hit-
ting later for 16 more in thejunior’s
highest scoring game as a Panther,
and had 10 rebounds.

“After halftime we needed to take
our time, look inside and get it to the
best man open all day,” Armstrong
said.

“Keith played extremely well; it
shows what kind of center he’ll be
here at Pitt,” Chipman said.

Chipman let the compliments
stand there, ready to. perform a ver-
bal autopsyion a snake-bitten. team.
The Panthers shot a very un-Big
Eastish 30 percent before-the half,
finishing with 46.9 percent from the
field. '

“First of all it was a game of two
halves. I think we were ready to play,
but we didn’t for any number of rea-
sons. I think we were too concerned
with Xavier doing too many things,
changing their defense around a lot.
Then we came out in the second half
and were concerned with what we
wanted to do. We went after them in
the second half, but it wasn’t much
of a factor.”

Although Chipman disagreed
with Aiken’s force-shooting theory

, — Pitt attempted only 20 field goals

in the first half —— nobody disputed
the temporarily sustained comeback
effort when Pitt outscored the Mus-
keteers 25-12 for its only lead.

Aiken scored eight of his 1.‘ points
in the second half, followed by fresh-
man Charles Smith’s four of his total
seven. The lead died as Xavier fresh-
man Byron Larkin dominated the
game‘s final three minutes, pumping
in eight points to seal the win. He
finished with 13 points, behind for-
ward Richard Harris with 16, and
tied with Walter McBride, who
nailed ll points after foul trouble
sidelined him in the first half.

“I don’t want to make any
excuses,” said Smith, who shot
three-of—l4. “We were trying to do
too many things at one time. We
weren’t patient. That's about it. But
I don’t want to sit here and make
excuses. It takes a man to admit his
mistakes. But it’s no big deal, I'll
bounce right back.” j_

Added Aiken, “If there were ever
such a thing as a.good loss, this is it

were waiting, really, till those guys
got better.

“You get stagnated. You just
don't operate that way. A lot of
coaches get in that rut. They get in
that thing, well, holy mackerel,
maybe we're too tough on them;
maybe we should lighten up.”

And, indeed, Fazio retreated with
his game plan. Retreated so much,

he implied, that once the Panthers
returned to campus in time for the
Sept. l opener against Brigham
Young, “We kind of lost that
reckless-type feeling.”

One 20-14 loss later, the ’84 sche-
dule took the Panthers careening on
their collision-ridden course. Open
season on the defensive secondary
promptly began. The secret was out:
Penetrate any side except corner-
back Melvin Dean’s, and long-
yardage plays and unconditional
touchdowns were guaranteed. Not
even half the schedule was filmed
before Fazio belaborcd the other-
cornerback dilemma: first Teryl
Austin gets burned, then it's John
“Ducky”-Lewis and Quintin Jones
under fire. Skin grafts, amazingly,
were never necessary.

“One, I believe our [pass] rush was
lacking early in the season," said
Fazio, trying desperately to defend
deteriorating pass coverage. “Two,
the mistake we made was trying to
move Billy Callahan to free safety,
although in the first football game I
thought he played very well. Once
we got him back to strong safety we
strengthened that position."

When your rush end, namely
Doleman, has a.mere two sacks all
year, “lacking” is putting it gener-
ously. As it was, noseguard Dennis
Atiyeh led in‘that category (eight),
ahead of guard Walter Johnson
(five) and linemen Bob Buczkowski,
Woods and Steve Apke (all with
three). I

If anything good came of three
wins in II games, several points
merit mention. A quick glance can-
not readily unmask another fresh-
man, running back tandem as
effective as tailbacks Craig “Iron-
head” Heyward and Charles Glad-
man. Heyward never started until
the East Carolina game, yet finished
atop the rushing list with 539 yards
(4.4 per carry) and four TDs. Glad-
man played second ﬁddle, getting
525 for 3.9 yards .a carry. _

A similar baptism by fire con-
sumed flanker Chuckie Scales, who
finished second in receptions behind
split end Bill Wallace with 431 yards,
though was tops with 19.6 yards per
catch. Recall that Scales last ran
consistently from tailback when his
41. yards against BYU made him
expendable.

After an effective performance
against Tulane and an even stronger
one in the 31-11 miracle at Beaver
Stadium, Congemi is healthy and
ready to give Notre Dame transfer
Joe Felitsky a spirited battle at quar-
terback. Felitsky, from day one at
fall camp, has had the pinpoint accu-
racy last seen in the Fiesta Bowl.

Successful season ends
in Nebraska for spikers

By Laurie Kubli
The Pitt News

Of the 240‘ teams playing Division,
1 women's volleyball, Pitt finished

_ on the fringe of the Top 20 after

losing to the Cornhuskers at
Nebraska Saturday 6-15, 10-15, I6-
18. Approximately 2,000 fans
watched No. 7 Nebraska put away
Pitt, whose season record came to
30-8. The Cornhuskers advance to
the final 16 to play Western Michi-
gan at Western Michigan, while Pitt
is forced to look“ ahead to next
season.

“Nebraska played a great match
and showed why they are ranked
seventh in the nation,” said Pitt
coach Shelton Collier. “But, I can
assure you that we will be back at
NCAAS next year and we'll be
ready. ’

“Many people would have picked
us to be 19-19, particularly with a
player as important as Judy Young
out for the year, but this team had
good determination and excellent
team chemistry."

It was the final match of their col-

’ legiate careers for the three seniors

on the team, who will probably
never play volleyball at the same
level as they have for the past four
years. ‘

“It's disappointing, but it was
such a great season,” said senior set-
ter Cathy Rupp. “Nebraska got off
to such a fast start that we were kind
of shell-shocked. Their crowd really
helped them out, being behind
them.”

Nebraska coach Terry Pettit said
that Rupp was by far the best server

application

in the country. The setter led the
match with 28 assists and also led in
serving with six aces. “Anybody on
our team could have served that
well, but it happened to be me,”
Rupp said.

Sue Hoover led the match in kills
with 15, followed by senior Ulana
Kohutiak's l3_. Kohutiak said that

' the .season’s success was in the team

meeting its short-term objectives.
“That’ll do it every time," she said.
“We just got up for every match."

Outside hitter and senior Pat
Belcher said that the team went out
and played well but that they could
have played better. “We’re only
human. We had prepared all season
long for the Big East but we really
hadn’t prepared for the NCAAs. We
did our best, so I don’t feel too bad
about losing."

“We achieved a lot this season,"
said Collier. “We gained a lot of
national respect. We won a lot of
prestigious tournament ‘champion-
ships, beat a lot of ranked teams,
won the Big East conference cham-
pionship, and at one time or another
five different players were selected to
all-tournament teams. Six of our
eight losses were to teams with
national rankings. <

“Our seniors played their most
productive and successful seasons of
their careers," Collier continued.
“We prepared for Nebraska — our
scouting report was extremely accu-
rate and we were strategically ready
as a result of our practice, but being
strategically ready is one thing.
Playing in front of that large a crowd
and with Nebraska playing that well,
it was just impossible to win."

Swimmers finish

By Mary Dalgle
The gig News

First-term competition came to a
close for the Lady Panther swim
team as they placed third at the Penn
State relays this past weekend.

Coach David Belowich was more
than satisfied with the team's per-
formance coming in third behind

Penn State and Virginia, which tied .

for first place. The Lady Panthers
took fourth place at the meet last
year.

“We swam extremely well for
where we are in the season," Belo-
wich said. “This is the part of the
season where we like to work on
background or enhancing strength.
We’re not as worried about speed
and technique; that comes later on in
the season."

Speed was one thing the Lady
Panthers were not lacking. Accord-
ing to Belowich, almost all the team
members swam their best times of
the season.

The performances of Tracey Pfis-
ter, Susan Hickman, Alicia Dugan
and Cindy Rose ‘in the 400-yard
freestyle relay, with a time of
3:31.62, was an example of that kind
of record-setting swimming.

“That was the fastest that I’ve seen
any relay team swim that event since
my first year of coaching here in

1981,” Belowich said. He also

pointed out that the 400 freestyle ‘

relay team had improved their time
from the morning by four seconds.

3 third

Sophomore Susan Hickman
guaranteed herself a trip to the
NCAA Championship meet in Ala-
bama this spring by making the
qualifying cut time in the 50-yard
freestyle with her time of 23.46.

Hickman, who also swam her sea- .
sonal best in the 100-yard freestyle,. —

was pleased with the meet.
“I'm happy with my performance.
Making the cuts for nationals takes

a little pressure off of me and it;'. _
serves as a motivator for the rest of '

the season," she said.

The Lady Panther divers had a
successful meet, taking first place on V
the I-meterboard and second place
on the 3-meter board. The scoring
for the divers was also done in relay
style. The scores of the two divers on
each board were combined for the
total score.

The team of Jennifer Brown and
Tricia Ney, who dove from the 3-
meter board, scored 834.65 for
second place. That also qualiﬁed
Ney for the NCAA pre-qualifying
meet at Harvard this March. _

_Ney and junior Tricia Shultz com-
bined their scores on the l-meter
board to take first place. Shultz also
made cuts for the national pre-
qualifying competition in that event.

The swim team has a month’s

break until competition will inten- V -

sify, according to Coach Belowich.
He said that more strenuous training
is needed to prepare the team for the
second half of the season. Competi-
tion for the Lady Panthers resumes
on Jan. 12, when they host Penn
State.

well as they might have, since the
Panthers lost to the Japanese
229.20-220.90.

The Panthers were not expected
to win. They were playing what was
a “Japanese All-America team."
Head coach Frank D’Amico chose
to look at the positive aspect of the
Panthers’ showing. “I‘m happy with
it [the score]; we did very well. Five

Blue-gold runners tie  

the 50-yard dash, respectively.
Overall, Coach Vasvary said that
he was pleased with the way in which
his team has progressed so far this
season. “We will be a little bit better
all around; it may not show at first
because of the strength of our con-
ference, but as we grow a little older
it will start to be noticeable," Vas-
vary said.

continued from page twelve

prepared for such a competition and
the crowd obviously appreciated
this. This was especially evident at
the close of the meet, when fans
gathered anxiously around the gym-
nasts to secure autographs and offer
congratulations. “I liked all of it,”
said one young spectator awaiting a
signature of her brochure. “I
thought the teams were really good
and exciting.”

Assistant men's coach Dave

A Smith was very pleased with his

team’s performance that evening.
“We missed a few sets that people

to good for gym men

years ago, a score of 220 would have
won nationals. They didn’t score
easily on us and we have a lot of
injuries." One of the effects of the
many injuries was that Mark Klaf-
ter, who sprained an ankle, was
unable to perform in his strongest
event, the floor exercise.

“I don’t think my injury really
hurt us tonight,” the All-America
candidate said. “The guys were
wonderful. They really did a great
job covering up for us with all the
injuries we have." Klafter also said
that in a meet against an American
school, the injury would have been
more of a blow to the team. “If it
were a closer match, we would have
had more of a problem, but the Jap-
anese are so good that it didn’t really
matter."

The Japanese are better than
good. The University All-Star team
came up with two scores of9.8 and
had only two scores all night fall
below 9.0. It was a Japanese routine
that elicited the loudest crowd
response of the night. Yuichi Nakata
stunned the crowd with a dazzling
high bar routine, finishing with a
triple spin and a perfect landing off a
double ﬂip. Nakata earned a 9.8 and
a two-minute ovation from the large
crowd.

For the Panthers, the best was
saved for last. In the ﬁnal routine of
the meet, it was Matt Peters’ turn to
electrify the crowd with a stunning
bar routine of his own. ‘That routine
was enough to give Peters a 9.8 in the
event, the highest Pitt score of the
night.

Pitt’s lone freshman, Jorge San-
chez, in the glare of the college spot-
light for the first time, performed
well. “I did better than I expected,”
he said. “It was a great competition
for everyone. The Japanese are a
great team.”

Sanchez saw action in all six
events, notching scores ranging
from a low of 8.4 in the pommel
horse to a high of 9.6 in the vault.
The former New York state cham-
pion is considered a likely All-
America candidate in the vault.

“I really have to be satisﬁed with
our team,” D’Amico added. “With
the loss of Kevin Garren and with
Mark being only so-so, I have to be

satisfied with our team and how we

pulled together.”

have been hitting all week, but we
also had a lot of surprises. Our goal
was to get a 220 and that‘s what we
got.” '

Pitt gymnast Mark Klafter had a
sprained ankle and was only able to
compete in four of his six events.
“Some of my events I had to hold
back on a little, but hopefully I'll be
healthy for next season,” said Klaf-
ter. Klafter’s injuries couldn't keep
him from feeling the excitement in
the air Friday night. The spirit ofthe
team after the meet wasn‘t reflective
of their loss. “The meet was enjoy-
able and the Japanese were a plea-
sure to compete with,” said Klafter.

After the competition when four
young girls were asked what they
enjoyed most about the meet, they
harmoniously replied, “We liked

Jorge!" When asked why they liked -

Jorge, they answered, “Because he’s
cute and a real good gymnast. We
call him Gorgeous Jorge.”

Pitt’s top freshman gymnast,
Jorge Sanchez, was pleased with his
first home performance with the
Panthers. “For three days before the
meet I was really nervous, but the
great support of the team helped me
to relax and I hit my events better
than I expected," said Sanchez. “The
competition brought the team a lot
closer and everyone was routing for
everyone else. The home" court
advantage helped a lot. The Japa-
nese teams were really talented. We
needed a boost and we got it from
the audience. It was a great expe-
rience for everyone.”

it. Kristy Pieters, with the theme
song from “Raiders Of The Lost
Ark” booming through the arena
sound system, soared through her
ﬂoor routine knowing her team was
locked in a nip-and-tuck battle with
the Japenese team and needed every
point it could muster.

Showing the grit and determina-
tion that characterized and made
Indiana Jones famous, Pieters for-

Effort not enough as Pitt falls to Japanese

her hand — a hand wrapped in ban-
dages — and went out and hit one of
the best ﬂoor routines of the night.

But the willingness to win was not
enough as the Lady Panthers gym-
nasts fell just short of the Japanese
All-Stars, l44.45-144.20. “I was very
pleased with our performance
tonight," said a beaming head coach
Donna Sanft after the Friday meet,
“We showed mental toughness
tonight; we did well at the end,
which shows our team has a lot of
guts. All of the girls did very well.”

The girl who did better than
anyone was Pitt’s Alisa Spector. She
won the overall with a score of 36.35,

edging out Japan’s Mieko Ohara,
who finished second with a score of
36.20. “It wasjust great,” said soph-
more Spector. “We pulled through
as a team. We showed we have a lot
of toughness by performing as well
as we did. It just all came together
for us tonight.” Spector hit a double
back ﬂip in her floor exercise, a
move few wo_men perform as suc-
cessfully as she. “It was just a matter
of getting my head together for that
move, and Ijust went for it.”

Of the four events the Lady
Panthers won only the uneven paral-
lel bars, but they were close in every
event. On the bars, it was Beth

Waters and Spector who led the
charge, each scoring 9.2. “I feel
really happy about it,” Waters said.
“The Japanese team made me a little
nervous, but it wasn't too bad.”

Judging from the surprising per-
formance of the team, one could not
have known that the women had
been hit with a rash of recent injuries
to key team members. “My hand
was bothering me a little bit,”admit-
ted Pieters after the meet, “but for
this meet I was able to overcome it.”
Pieters added she felt this was an
excellent beginning for the young
squad. “We had a fantastic meet; I
think we all did very well.”

 

The meet was also a beginning for
the three Pitt freshmen who saw
action. “I did better than I
expected,” said Baldwin native Kim
Calderone. “I don’t think nervous-
ness really affected me. I was ner-
vous, but I was concentrating onjust
hitting my routines so I didn't really
notice it. I didn’t think about it.”
Calderone’s high score was a 9.0 for
a crowd-pleasing routine.

It was Beth Waters, however, who
was the most successful freshman
performer of the night, finishing
second in the overall with a score of
36.25. The other freshman Pitt sent
in was Katie Monaghan, whose high
score was an 8.95 in the vault.

A chilly, drenching rain was fal-
ling Friday night as gymnastics fans,
including families, students and
aspiring young gymnasts from the
area, climbed Cardiac Hill to watch
the Pitt Gymnastic teams in action.
The crowd at Fitzgerald Field
House wasn’t the typical mixture
one would expect to find at any
other university sporting event.
Enthusiastic cheers were heard from
both sides of the floor for each

Last Thursday the University of
Pittsburgh men’s indoor track team
began their season with a develop-

tition came from within as the team
was divided into a blue squad and a
gold squad that tied at 48 points a
piece.

But as the meet’s name indicated,
it was only an exhibition of sort.
Coach Vasvary said, “Our main pur-
pose was to get our guys some expe-
rience in a meet-type situation and
to prepare for the upcoming George
Mason Invitational this weekend

(Dec.8).”

The Panthers need this experience
because their 44-member squad is
composed of 17 freshmen and I4
sophomores. Coach Vasvary said,
“Thisis part of our rebuilding pro-
cess. We want to maintain the tradi-
tion that we started two years ago.
We’ll have our ups and downs, but
we’ll have a good team because we’re
bringing in some outstanding ath-

letes.” He is bringing in some out-
standing athletes, indeed, as the list
of recruits is led by three high school
track All-Americas: Rodney Giles,
Calvin Holmes and Lee McRae.
Although the team was hit hard
by the graduation of such talented
runners as Garland Brown and
Todd‘ Colas, Coach Vasvary feels
that they left behind a good example
for the rest of the team to follow.
