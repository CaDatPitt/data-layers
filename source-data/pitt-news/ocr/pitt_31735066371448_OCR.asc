Faculty responds
to proposed cuts

By Peggy Ferri
And Donald Porter
The Pitt News

A number of Pitt faculty agree
that the university must plan forthe
future, but many have reservations
about Pitt provost Roger Benja-
min’s call; for a 25 percent budget
cut and his request that departments
evaluate and rate their priorities.

“The result of it [the planning pro-
cess] may not be perfect when it’s
done, but it’s much better thanjust
letting things happen,” said Pitt
Spanish professor Keith McDuffie.

Benjamin delivered his report on
the development of academic priori-
ties last Thursday before the Univer-
sity Senate. warning that Pitt can
only be prepared to meet future
needs if his office has a “proper
understanding of each unit’s aca-
demic priorities and plans in order
to provide the foundation for aca-
demic decision-making."

Departments are required to sub-
mit their reports to the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences dean Jerome
Rosenberg by June. An internal
FAS committee will assist Rosen-
berg in preparing the report. Two
membersfrome each area -~ humani-
ties, natural sciences and social
sciences —- will be selected, and
Rosenberg said he expects to have
the list by April I.

The reports will be evaluated
according to the following criteria:
quality, contribution to Pitt’s “mis-
sion” or degree to which the pro-
gram represents the university’s
purpose, student demand, cost-
effectiveness and rationale for the
program’s existing at Pitt.

“The goal for this office is to get a
sense of priorities and what to

emphasize...in the next several
years,“ Benjamin said in an earlier
interview. “This is not just a bunch
of budget cuts.”-

He added that the planning pro-
cess is an effort to ensure that all
departments come back with their
priorities ranked.

McDuffie said the university
planning effort begun in 1975 did
not have as much faculty involve-
ment as this one will.

“I am concerned about the bal-
ance,” he said. “The university can-
not respond to market demands.
Pitt must have a balanced program
and retain the universal aspect of
education.”

The university should not over-
emphasize computer science, he
said, calling for continued attention
to be paid to the humanities, social
sciences and natural sciences.

Pitt is not overextended yet, he
said, but it could become overex-
tended if “one does not think ahead
about where to employ resources."

Pitt professor and president of
United Faculty, Philip Wion said he
has his reservations abouthow plan-
ning could affect tenure.

If a program is changed or
phased-out, he explained, there is a
real question as to where those
tenured faculty members will go.

Benjamin proposed that tenured
professors could be moved to other
departments.

Pitt English professor James
Knapp said the planning process
calls for a lot of work to be done in a
short period of time.

Time is also a concern for Pitt
history professor Peter Karsten.

“The dean [Rosenberg] has asked
departments to evaluate themselves,
and some of the larger ones will have

Pitt researchers will begin a study
of male homosexual volunteers
today examining the risks of
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syn-
drome (AIDS), a disease most com-
mon among gay men.

The research could involve up to
l0,000 men, according to Dr. Char-
les Rinaldo, assistant professor of
clinical pathology and microbiol-
ogy. Rinaldo is the principal investi-
gator for the $4.36 million contract
between Pitt and the federal govern-

'ment to continue AIDS research.

Pitt was chosen because Pittsburgh,

l.____

‘Pitt was chosen because Pittsburgh, unlike
San Francisco and New York, has a low
incidence rate of the disease in spite of its
growing gay community.’

York, has a low incidence rate ofthe
disease in spite of its growing gay
community, he said.

The contract provides Pitt with

‘the funds to investigate the disease
over the next four years, Rinaldo
said. The contract, which took effect
on Sept. 30, I983, is scheduled to
end on Sept. 29, I987.

Rinaldo said that there are three
phases to the upcoming study. The
first part, which begins today, will be

_a study of approximately 5,000-

8,000 healthy gay men and will con-
tinue for two-and-one-half years.

The researchers will extract blood
samples from the men exclusively
for serum, and volunteers will also
be asked to fill out a short question-
naire about their lifestyles.

The second study will begin in
April and will include 2,000 healthy
male homosexuals. These men will
be given a more extensive question-
naire, as well as a physical exam to
look for the warning signs of AIDS,

Rinaldo said. The volunteers will be
asked to submit throat washings and
specimens of their urine, blood.

. stool and semen, he said. These spec-

imens will be stored in repositories,
both locally and nationally, and will
be available to AIDS researchers
around the world.

The third part of the study
involves men who already have
AIDS, Rinaldo said. The victims
will be matched according to such
factors as age and race, he said, and
a laboratory—based, case—control
study will 'be performed upon them
to determine the differences and
similarities between the groups.

There are eight known survivors
of AIDS living in Pittsburgh,
according to William Holder, an
employee at the Allegheny County

Health Department. Betty Hooper,
spokesman for the Center for Dis-
ease Control in Atlanta, said San
Francisco has 442 reported cases of
AIDS and New York City has 1,497
cases of the disease. Hooper said
that as of March I2, there were 3,694
AIDS victims in the United States.

Rinaldo said that the Pittsburgh
researchers have confirmed two
links between certain practices and
the occurrence ofAIDS: The greater
the number of sexual partners a
male homosexual has, the greater
the risk of his getting AIDS; and,
that genital-anal sex seems to pro-
duce a higher risk of acquiring
AIDS.

While the symptoms of AIDS can
be treated, the infections will recur,
said Rinaldo.

Refugees discredit elections

By Bob Steen
The Pitt News

Yesterdays election in El Salva-
dor was less than free and honest,
according to two refugees from that
country who spoke at a Pitt Interna-
tional Affiars Forum program Fri-
day afternoon.

Presidential elections were held
yesterday in El Salvador following
intensified rebel attacks and
bombings.

The married couple, who have
been living in Pittsburgh as illegal
aliens and prefer to be known only
as Manuel and Gloria, spoke to an
audience of fewer than l0 at David
Lawrence Hall. They had been trav-
elling salesmen in their home coun-
try, Gloria said.

International Affairs Forum pres-
ident Dana Reed, who introduced
the couple, explained after the talk
that the couple did not wish to have
their true names used because they
are in the U.S. illegally. They also
have nine children in El Salvador
whom they fear may be endangered
by what their parents say here
against the country’s government,
he said.

“The elections in El Salvador have

always been quite fraudulent,"

Manuel said through an interpreter.

“What would it be like," he asked,
“if everybody in the United States
was forced to vote by the Army?"

His wife Gloria explained that, in
the National Assembly elections in
1982, all voters received invisible-
ink stamps on the back of their
hands. The military could easily
check these stamps, she explaind, to
determine whether people had voted
or not.

She said that those who hadn‘t
voted were beaten and sometimes
seriously injured by government
soldiers who regarded non-voters as
leftist guerrillas. Gloria told of being
knocked down and kicked in such an
incident.

The hand stamps aren’t being
used this time, she said, but ballot
cards can be checked to see that peo-
ple have voted.

Manuel called attention to the
limited political range of the candi-
dates. “The election will not be
entirely free,” he said, “because the
only parties you can vote for are
rightist parties.”

The country’s leftist coalition, the
Democratic Revolutionary Front
and the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front (FDR-FMLN),
have been invited to field candidates
but have declined because they say
the presence of right—wing death
squads makes the risk to potential
candidates’ lives too great.

For a long time, Manuel said. civ-
ilian candidates have not been able
to get established becuse of military
intervention. He said that any such
attempt in this election would surely
have been stopped.

In his introduction, Reed sug-
gested that this would be like an elec-
tion in the United States in which
everybody to the left of and includ-
ing former Vice-President Walter
Mondale would be excluded.

Both husband and wife remained
expressionless as they made their
short statements in a grim tone of
voice.

The couple is receiving support
from the church-supported Sanctu-
ary movements, which houses Cen-
tral American refugees in churches
across the country. They are staying
at the Mennonite Church in Point
Breeze.

Reverend Harold Wenger of the
Mennonite church said the church
has provided the couple with a base-
ment room since last August.
Church funds have covered the cost
of the accomodations, while dona-
tions from other churches have

helped defray the cost of other A

necessities, he said.

“Providing hospitality to people
who have run away from their coun-
try to save their lives is viewed by us
as a Christian act of compassion,”
Wenger said.

“Footnotes
without tears"

Presidential candidate to speak

By Dan Bates
The Pitt News

Feminist leader Sonia Johnson
will be in Pittsburgh Wednesday to
take part in a campaign for the pre-
sidency of the United States. She is
not a supporter of Gary Hart or an
organizer for Walter Mondale ~-
she is a candidate.

Johnson is running as a candidate
of the Citizens Party, the party
which emerged in I980 with environ-
mentalist Barry Commoner as its
first presidential nominee.

Commoner managed to win less
than I percent of the total national
vote in that election, but the party
has survived.

“The main goal of the partyis to
offer an alternative voice in the two-
party system,” said Julie Ainslie,
Johnson's press secretary, last week.

Ainslie said the party wants to
move in a new political direction,
away from the “practical politics” of
the Democrats and Republicans.
The party, she explained, wants to

vs?

Name

focus less on political posturing and
more on the specific issues
themselves.

Johnson was approached last fall
by the Citizens Party. which was
seeking a woman as its presidential
candidate.

“To them, Sonia was an out-
spoken. articulate and outstanding
feminist leader,” Ainslie said.

Johnson is nationally known for
her vocal support of the Equal
Rights Amendment and nuclear dis-
armament. In I979, she was excom-
municated from the Mormon
Church because she supported the
ERA, an issue strongly opposed by
the Mormons, who feared the ERA
would threaten morality and family
life. She also participated in a
women’s protest at the Greenham
Cruise missile site, a NATO site in
England. She has recently returned
from a disarmament conference in
Europe.

Johnson is pushing for world
peace and an end to oppression
caused by powerful corporations,
according to Liz Hughes, the former
chairman of the Consumer Party,

which supports the Citizens Party.
As a feminist, though, Johnson
believes that the male mentality of
making war must be confronted
with feminist views of peace, accord-
ing to Hughes.

“its up to women to take the dras-
tic step toward peace. Women must
see their power and utilize it to
improve society," Hughes said.

Corporations, Hughes said,
create oppression while seeking
maximum profit, and Johnson
wants to end this through govern-
ment control. Mellon Bank, for
instance, had investments in Brazil,
where workers only received 30
cents an hour and lived in poverty.

“This is the oppression Sonia is
aiming to stop," she explained.

Hughes believes that Johnson is
running at the right time.

“People will catch on, and women
will react to it," she said.

Sonia Johnson will present her
presidential campaign address this
Wednesday at Carlow College’s
Kresge Theater in Oakland at 7:30
p.m.

weekend?), I do feel that statements
like those above should be publicly
addressed.

I am a feminist. That doesn't

wrecker or a baby-killer. lt does
mean that I desire to change an
unbalanced society, that I want to
get rid of confining stereotypes that
oppress both men and women. lt
also means that I respect my wom-
anhood and demand like respect
from others.

It doesn’t seem silly to me that “I
want my equal status guaranteed by
the Constitution." Just as the right
to vote could only be guaranteed to
women by an amending of the Con-
stitution, the inclusion of the notion
that “equality of rights underthe law
shall not be denied on account of
sex“ in the Constitution is necessary

The whole bathroom non-issue is
propaganda coming from groups
which are obviously threatened by
such notions. Various privacy acts
assure you the right to your unhin-
dered answer to the call of nature
(without anyone watching).

Believe it or not, not every woman
wants to be a mother. (Yes, contrary
to popular beliei, women do have
some control over their bodies). Of
course, motherhood is a noble pur-
suit (in fact,.my own mother chose it,
for which 1 will be eternally grate-
ful). Clearly, however. motherhood

While l had hoped that the myth
of “biology is destiny" had long been
dead, evidence of a friend’s recent
conversation with a professor here
showed me otherwise. My friend, an
honor student with a bright future
ahead of her, was advised to look
into fields that are less competitive.
less demanding, in order that she
might be able to easily re-enter the
job market after raising her children.

From Where I Stand/ Chris Bosso

Indigestion from too much commercial beef  

And now, it‘s on the cover of
Newsweek.

“Where’s the beef?”

All right, it was funny at first. In
fact, it was more than funny. It was
hysterical.

It was all a classic commercial
should be. I still giggle every time I
see that marvelous little old lady, her
face an endearing contradiction of
perpetual suffering and sudden
indignation, that eyebrow notched
skeptically at the beefless bun. You
can almost feel that contempt of
hers, the sort ofcontempt that most
of us develop toward university
bureaucrats.

And the slogan! Vaudevillians of
old ached for such punch lines, the
sort of quips that endure long after
their originators have passed on.
College kids across America have
made it part of their vocabulary, no
doubt to the mystification of their
elders.

“Where’s the beef?”

But my goodness me, it isn’t that
funny any more. Oh, I don’t mind
the torrent of T-shirts, caps, buttons
and the inevitable underwear. I
expectthat much from a society that
goes silly over pet rocks and ugly
little dolls. I do mind, however, that
this infernal slogan has become a
central part of the Democratic presi-
dential campaign. I’m not terribly
surprised, mind you, just a bit
peeved. .

Blame it all on Walter Mondale.

A‘ When last we met, Fritz was search-

ing frantically for some way to derail
Gary Hart’s ’" sudden momentum
(a.k.a. Big’Mo). Sudden_lv. during a
debate in Atlanta two weeks ago
while Hart talked enigmatically
about his vaunted “new ideas,” it
struck Walter out out of the blue.
You could almost see the lightbulb
ﬂashing above his head as he turned
to answer Hart. Grinning impishily,
the normally staid Mondale asked
simply, “Where’s the beef?

Everyone laughed. Fritz scored,
and he knew it. And being the savvy

politician he is, Fritz knew that he
had a winner on his hands, and
before long, he was beefing up and
down America’s byways about
Hart’s alleged beeflessness.

And it worked. It worked for Fritz
exactly because it worked for Wen-
dy's. Network news shows, always
eager for the quick and pithy quote,
could now sum up Mondale’s attack
on Hart in less time than it takes to
spell “relief.” And audiences loved it
because it was funny and quotable,
which only encouraged Mondale to
repeat it with nauseating regularity.

And it was effective, so effective
that Hart, seeking to regain his lost

The Lincoln-Douglass debate this
isn’t. It is nothing but the trivializa-

the sad trend toward reducing cam-
paign issues and personalities to the
status of fast food.

But let’s not be too surprised by all
this. The medium is the message,
goes the shopworn saying, and tele-
vision is the medium of politics these
days. Television dotes on the flashy,
the dramatic, the visually entertain-

times dry arguments about complex

Politicians, especially those run-
ning for president, know this. The
smarter, or shallower (I can't quite
decide), of them will package their
appeals to the voter like so much soft
drink or candy. It‘s all long on piz-
zazz and catch slogans and awfully
short on nutrition; it’s the kind of
stuff that voters can digest without
really thinking hard.

A foreign friend of mine, now an
expert on both American football
and ‘politics, remarked that the way
we choose our presidents doesn't
seem too rational, but it sure is fun
to watch. True, I suppose, but so is
“Entertainment Tonight.” And it’s
getting harder all the time to tell the
difference.

Pitt experts assess problems

Education system under fire

By Michael Selz
The Pitt News

Last April 26, the National Com-
mission on Excellence in Education
released a grim report on the state of
education in the United States.
Many of the recommended changes
would entail a signiﬁcant rethinking

. of methods used to train teachers.

Pitt's School of Education, in the
ll months since the report, has held
a number of symposia and
consciousness-raising sessions dis-
cussing the report and other educa-
tional concerns in the hope of
keeping step with the changes.

The report, entitled “A Nation at
Risk,” took a decidedly global focus.
One line reads, “Our once unchal-
lenged preeminence in commerce,
industry, science and technological

innovation is being overtaken by?

competitors throughout the world.”
In another instance, it refers to the
trend as a “unilateral educational
disarmament.”

The commission’s charter asked
that it examine the quality of teach-
ing and learning in the nation’s
school system, compare America's
school system with those of other
industrialized nations, evaluate the
evaluative methods in use (grading

and national standardized testing),

and define problems that must be
addressed to ensure the improve-
ment of education.

Some of Pitt’s leading experts in
the field of education — James
Kelly, dean of the School of Educa-
tion; Dr. Nancy Cole, the school’s
associate dean; and Dr. Lawrence
Knolle, the head of Faculty Council
and the department of curriculum
supervision — offered their views on
the report and its ramifications.

They noted that on 19
internationally-administered tests,
American students never placed first

or second and placed last in seven of
them. They observed that many
other industrialized countries
require the study of sciences for all
students after sixth grade and spend
about three times theclass time on
these subjects as do American cur-
ricula, even those that are specifi-
cally science—oriented. Also, some
other countries require 220 eight-
hour school days per year, com-
pared to America’s I80 six-hour
days.

“I have trouble dealing with inter-
national comparisons,” Cole said.
“Something in me doesn't believe
that data. The sample is what I
question.

“Ours [schools] have the full span
of ability. Other countries begin
sorting their kids early on. They can

pick the best kids for international -

testing, but we’ve got all ranges of
kids still in school in the l2th grade.
They have elitist systems. Ours is
mass education.”

Kelly agreed. “In other countries,
education is a sorting device. This is
not the purpose of education in
America.”

Knolle added, “The cultural dif-
ferences are so vast that you just
can't compare. In Korea, a monthly

Kelly denied that the report‘s glo--
bal view was anything but militaris-
tic, maintaining that according to
many economists, the war industry
contributes heavily to the nation’:;
economic health.

As to the suggestion that an edu-
cation assessment should incorpo-
rate comparisons with other
countries in a world where Korea
makes the steel for our country and
the Mon Valley has 50 percent
unemployment, Kelly had no
further comment.

to go through a painful process of
self-evaluation," he said.

Some programs might be termi-
nated, and this, he said. might “gen-
erate some heat.“ The result, he said.
will be “regrettable, but necessary.“

“I feel that using the faculty is
important for making clear deci-
sions. They are the experts and
know the programs the best,” Ben-
jamin said. The criteria, be added,
are necessary to better assess
priorities.

Benjamin said similar planning
processes have worked at other uni-
versites, including the University of
Minnesota, where Benjamin served
as an administrator from I966 to
I983.

The University of Minnesota’s
budget planning was established in
I979 and is still working, according
to the university’s vice president,
Rich Heydinger.

Heydinger said that the only
problem Minnesota had with the
planning, which Benjamin helped
arrange, involved those programs
that the faculty failed to prioritize.

‘I feel that using the
fbeuhy 3 nnporunn

decisions... they are

——Roger Benjamin

Heydinger went on to say that the
university is able to take funds from
high-priority programs and put
them into the low—priority pro-
grams. So far, the planning process
has been a success, he said.

Pitt‘s faculty task force on plan-
ning will help Benjamin develop an
overall plan for the university.
Members on the task force represent
many departments and programs
including: social work, biology,

engineering, philosophy, public and

The task force will review all
reports submitted by university
schools and departments between
July and August‘. Its recommenda-
tions will be available in September
for discussion between Benjamin
and the faculty. Final decisions will
be presented to Chancellor Wesley
Posvar in January.

Newspapers sought for recycling

GRIP, the Group for Recycling in Pennsylvania, wants your
old newspapers — and not just to catch up on some reading.
GRIP collects newspapers in order to have them recycled into
newsprint, insulation and packaging. With the use of recycling,
it is estimated that the new paper can be published with a 50
percent reduction in energy. GRIP asks everyone tojoin in the
fight to conserve energy by saving newspapers. The group picks
up the papers on the last Sunday of each month in the Forbes
Ave. Skibo parking lot on the CMU campus.

Pitt takes second in debate

The William Pitt Debating Union placed second in the Pen-
nsylvania College Debates on Energy Tournament held last
Thursday in the State House in Harrisburg, sponsored annu-
ally by the Pennsylvania Electric Association and Westing-
house Corporation.

Freshmen Nancy Walker and Michael Koranda, sophomore
Jim Haug and senior Bill Davis lost a 16-15 decision in the final
round to a team from the University of Pennsylvania. Pitt
qualified for the tournament in January by taking first place in
a regional competition against other Western Pennsylvania

colleges and universities.

Deadly Duo

Maulers downed by shooting Stars

By Charlie O'Hara
The Pitt News

When Philadelphia pulled away
from Pittsburgh’s Maulers in the
second half of their United States
Football League (USFL) game Sat-
urday at Three Rivers Stadium, it
was the Penn State alumni combina-
tion of quarterback Chuck Fusina
and wide receiver_Scott Fitzkee that
provided the Stars‘ winning edge.

The former Nittany Lions con-
nected eight times for 177 yards and
three touchdowns in their teams 25-
10 victory.

In all, Fusina completed 16 passes
of 21 attempts for 249 yards, three
touchdowns and no interceptions.

For Fusina, who hails from
McKees Rocks, it was the first time
that he had played in Pittsburgh
since 1977, when he led the Lions to
a I5-I3 win in the snow at Pitt Sta-
dium. That was when Matt Cava-
naugh was quarterback at Pitt. His
last appearance at Three Rivers Sta-
dium was against the Tony Dorsett
national champion Pitt team of
I976. Pitt won 24-7.

After his tenure under Joe
Paterno, Fusina was drafted by the
Tampa Bay Bucaneers of the NFL

and was a backup to Doug Williams
for a couple years. He then signed
with the Stars and became their star-
ter a year ago.

“It's always great to win in Pitts-
burgh," Fusina said. “There‘s a cou-
ple Penn State guys on this team,
and we really had a lot offun getting
ready for this game.

“For me, it was great to see all
those people from Sto-Rox out
there cheering for me. That was
pretty special."

Fitzkee was the Lions’ punter
along with handling the split end
position for Paternal. He was
drafted by, and for a few years
played with, the Philadelphia
Eagles. He went on to play with the
San Diego Chargers and some their
West Division championship teams
before coming to the USFL last
year.

“I have come back and played in
Pittsburgh with the Chargers since I
was at Penn State," Fitzkee said.
“It’s a lot different from playing Pitt.
We used to kill for that game. That
was a helluva lot more intense
rivalry than any in the pros.

“We still have our rivals, but this
is professional football; it’sjust a lot
different.”

With the professional stuff aside,
Fusina and Fitzkee turned in the

best performances of their careers.

“I can remember a day when I was
at Penn State when I had two touch-
downs against Syracuse, but
nothing like this.” Fitzkee said.

“When you talk about three TDs
and no interceptions and the yard-
age, I guess it was my best day as a
pro," Fusina said. “But sometimes
statistics don’t always mean that
much.”

Entering the second half of Satur-
day's contest, the Stars (4-I) held a
6-3 advantage.

Their initial third-quarter drive
was to start at the Mauler 42-yard
line. After two consecutive first
downs, the Stars were at the Mauler
I6. Fusina went to Fitzkee for six
points. The lead went to 12-3.

After holding the Maulers to one
first down, Fusina and Fitzkee set
up shop again at their own 30. On
third down and three at the 37, the
connection hit for 13 yards. Fusina
kept the drive alive with two scram-
bles that gave his team important
first downs.

The Stars forged their way to the
Maulers’ 23-yard line when Fusina
found a down-and-outing Fitzkee in
the right corner of the end zone.
Fitzkee made the six-point grab, but
whether he had two feet in or not
was certainly too close to tell.

“The ref called me in. so I was in."
Fitzkee said.

“There are a lot ofjudgment calls
in every game,” Fusina said. “I'm
from the Stars, so I thought it was a
good call. I’m sure if I were on the
Maulers, I would be talking about it
now."

The Stars led I8-3 when the Maul-
ers (I-4) made a bit of a comeback.
The Pittsburghers went 7] yards on

ll:08 mark of the fourth quarter.
Mauler quarterback Glenn Carano
hit wide receiver Jackie Flowers
from five yards out for the score.

Philadelphia went to the well one
more time, this one a 40-yard strike
from Fusina to Fitzkee. The defen-
sive secondary ofthe Maulers fouled
up in their coverage. Fitzkee was the
third receiver on the play; he ran a
fly pattern and was supposed to
decoy a defender to go down field
with him. No Mauler took the bait,
and the next thing you knew, Fitz-
kee was at the goal line waving his
arms, wide, wide open.

“When I saw him there, I couldn’t
believe it,” Fitzkee said. “I hesitated
because I had never seen anybody
that wide open.”

The Maulers actually played their
strongest game of the season.

Dethroned

Culbertson’s benching mirrors
disappointing season for Pitt

By Scott Dellett
The Pitt News

He was the leader, the heart and
soul of a squad that for much of the
season needed a swift kick in the rear
to get moving. He supplied that.

The role was not his on a silver
platter, as some may have expected.
His steady, unspectacular play was
being pushed by a hotshot freshman
with all the trimmings expected
from the point guard position. He
was unsure, uneasy. The first mis-
take being his last, his spot being a
place on the bench.

But Friday night, his role was not
of director. It was of a spectator ~
watching a lead disappear. Waiting
on the bench, the eyes pleading for a
chance to contribute. Seeing the last
seconds click off with his face buried
in the palms of his hands.

Pitt point guard Billy Culbertson

ended his collegiate career against
Notre Dame without a ﬂourish,
without grandeur, like teammate
Clyde Vaughan, who left the court
with 14 seconds remaining to a
standing ovation from the remain-
ing spectators at the Fitzgerald Field
House.

Vaughan received the attention of
the media, answered questions
about his past and future plans. Cul-
bertson was left alone, his position
similar to that of the one he had on
the bench a short time earlier, to
suffer quietly what fate had left him.

One half hour later, Culbertson
remained on the stool in the locker
room, same stance.

He was willing to speak. Talk
about the season, of a career that
had more high and low points than a
year on the New York Stock
Exchange.

are  

Culbertson refused to criticize
Panther head coach Roy Chipman
for benching him in favor of crowd-
pleasing Curtis Aiken, but he
instead spoke about a season that to
some was a success but to others,
especially himself, a huge
disappointment.

“Curtis was playing well; that’s
why he kept him in,” Culbertson
said, his head lifted from his chest,
but his mood remained constant.
“There’s nothing against him.”

The Panther coach uttered similar
sentiments. “I thought he [Aiken]
was playing well, didn’t you? I put
Billy back in because [Aiken] was
tired.”

It was a tough reality for Culbert-
son, who led the team to its quarter-
final game.

In the first round, he scored I4
points and handed out six assists in
taking control of a Pitt attack that
managed 95 points. Against Florida
State, he hit both ends ofa one-and-
one which iced a 66-63 game at
Greensboro, N.C. He hit 10 consec-
tive free throws and 29 of 32 in the
last four games.

The 6-1 guard suggested that per-
haps playing away from the Fitz-
gerald Field House was not that hor-
,rible of a fate.

“We depended on the crowd to
fire us up,” he said. “We always were
charged up and played well at the
beginning, but when we got into the
real game, it wasn’t the same. There
were too many letdowns.

“We were at home, and we
expected a pretty good game, but we
didn’t play as hard. On the road, we
depended on ourselves to get fired
up, and we played hard.”

The opening I0 minutes of the
Notre Dame game was a prime
example. Two steals by Culbertson
zupplied an additional spark, as Pitt

lead down after the television
timeout at the 12:04 mark. By the

_next timeout, the game was tied.

“I looked up at the clock, and I
thought it was wrong," Culbertson
said.

If he was shocked then, he didn’t
expect the last three minutes. Notre
Dame guard Joe Howard burned
him on the baseline for a layup.
Then, in a mixup over the press the
Panthers were in, Culbertson
watched at midcourt as his man,
Notre Dame guard Scott Hicks, was
left unattended for a layup, starting
an eight-point run in which Pitt self-
destructed.

“_I didn't feel I let down,” Culbert-
son said. “I played well, but I was
sitting for so long.”

The detonation could have been
earlier this season. With the many
problems involving lack of play

-time, a negative affect was cast on a
"squad that had been projected to be

third in the Big East Conference by
one magazine. But the Panthers
managed to overcome.

“I’m proud of the way the guys
came back over adversity; guys’
leaving, lineup changes,” Culbert-
son said. “They came together to do
their best to salvage the season.”

The same adversity‘was the factor
in the Vaughan slump in the middle
of the season, according to
Culbertson.

“Clyde is the type of guy who
doesn’t like distractions,” he said.
“He comes in to play the game.”

Notre Dame brings back

the beef in 72-64 victory

By Bryan J. Fischer
The Pitt News

The Fighting Irish of Notre
Dame, inspired by the presence and
play of sophomore center Tim
Kempton. eliminated the Pitt
Panthers from the National Invita-
tional Tournament 72-64 Friday
night at Fitzgerald Fieldhouse.

“The beef is back,” pronounced
Irish coach Digger Phelps‘, referring
tolthe crucial role played by his 6-9
pivot man. Kempton returned to the
Notre Dame lineup after missing the
final six games ofthe regular season,
and his re—entry has coincided nicely
with his team’s resurgence. This
renewed vigor carried the Irish into
the NlT’s version ofthe Final Four,
beginning tonight in Madison
Square Garden.

Pitt was propelled into a 31-28
halftime lead by spirited defensive
play that forced ll turnovers. and
the continued hot hand of George
Allen. Allen had ‘connected for 14
points by intermission, and the
Panthers looked like a good bet to
make their second tournament trip
to the Big Apple this month.

Digger Phelps had other ideas.

First, Phelps went to a triangle-
and-two defense on Allen and Clyde
Vaughan, who were responsible for
all but two of ‘Pitt's first-half field.

t goals. “They took Clyde and George
’ away from us [in the second halfj,"

said a somber Roy Chipman. Allen,
who had been spectacular at times in
the first half, scored only four more
points in the game.

Next, Phelps had 6-8 forward Jim
Dolan help point guard Joe Howard
handle Pitt’s backcourt pressure.
The result was four Notre Dame
turnovers in the second half, equal-
ing the number of turnovers the _5-9
Howard committed in I3 first-half
minutes.

Phelps‘ best idea by far, however,
was, unleashing the brawny, red-
headed Kempton for the full 20 min-
utes of the second half.

Kempton was the Irish’s main
weapon in wiping out the Panthers’
three-point halftime advantage.
Although responsible for I0 second-

half points and four rebounds,’

I(empton’s contribution was more
visible on the Panthers’ score sheet.

Center Keith Armstrong, ,who
scored I3 points in the Panthers 67-
59 win at South Bend that Kempton
sat out, scored only one point. Six-
eight forward Andre Williams was
held scoreless, and no Panther col-
lected more than five rebounds. In
all, the Irish dominated Pitt by a

’ 37-23 margin on the boards, much of

the advantage due to Kempton’s
presence beneath the basket.

In addition to Notre Dame’s dom-
inance of the boards, which kept the
Panthers away from second shot
opportunities, the Irish connected
on a red hot 65 percent from the field
in the second half. With Kempton
“eating up space,” as Chipman put
it, Notre Dame took advantage ofits
freedom around the perimeter.

Irish forward Ken Barlow, who
missed his only shot from the field in
the first half, found the range on all
four second—half attempts. Senior
captain Tom Sluby added I0 to fin-
ish with a team—high I8, and How-
ard tossed in nine second—half points
for a game total of 15.

In spite of 2l hard-fought points
from Vaughan that included break-
ing the 2000 point plateau and the
record for most points by a Pitt
senior, the Panther effort fell short.

With Armstrong and Williams all
but absent from the Panther attack
and senior Billy Culbertson strug-
gling to lead the club. Notre Dame’s
halftime adjustments left the Panth-
ers a few guns shy of making a run
with the “beefed up” Irish. Although

3, freshman Curtis Aiken performed

admirably in his 20 minutes (13 in
the second half, while Culbertson
sat), he did make two costly turn-
overs that thwarted the Panther
comeback as much as anything else.

All in all, this was a game in which
neither team had expected to bejust

season, and there was little reason to

Shirk a
winner at
regionals

By Wes Cotter
The Pitt News

The Lady Panther gymnastics
team gave it their all at the NCAA
Northeastern Regional competition
over the weekend and came away
both winners and losers.

The Panthers had their best meet
of the season and made several new
entries in the Pitt record books. It
was an outstanding effort, but Pitt
fell short of Penn State ( I 84-18 I .90).
The score automatically advances
Penn State to the national cham-
pionship.

Pitt failed to move on by the slim
margin of two-tenths of a point. The
two-tenths that Pitt needed is what
will give the University of Washing-
ton the last of the five NCAA wild-
card bids.

The weekend Pitt spent in the
Happy Valley was filled with disap-
pointment, but it was also filled with
determination and excitement.

Pitt placed second in the six team
field but won a lion’s share of the
available regional honors. All-
America Lisa Shirk topped off Pitt’s
effort by taking firsts in the uneven
parallel bars (965) and the vault
(9.65).

Penn State’s Pam Loree was the
top all-around competitor with a
37.65, but Pitt was able to place
three gymnasts in the top five all-
arounds — Shirk (37.3) was second,
Alisa Spector (36.90) was third, and
Babbie Flock (36.55) was fifth.

These three automatically became
members of the All East team by
placing in the top five.

Each year at the regional competi-
tion, the gymnasts are asked to vote
for the Senior Gymnast of the Year.
Martin was selected as this year‘s
recipient. ‘

In similar fashion, the coaches of
the Eastern region chose Pitt’s head
coach Donna Sanft as the Coach of
the Year.

In addition to winning these
awards, Pitt established several
school records Saturday night. The
most important of these being the
overall team record. Earlier this sea-
son, Pitt broke 180 for the first time,
this weekend it came close to 182.

Quite simply, it’s the best team
that Pitt has ever had.

In the process of making history
some minor school records were also
pushed aside. Flock scored a 9.5 on
the balance beam and now holds the
Pitt record. The old team total for
the floor exercise was 44.9; it’s now
45.15.

Quite a few of Pitt’s performers
had the best meets of their lives.
Sanft said, “This is the kind of team
that does good against good compe-
tition. They did what they were sup-
posed to do. I’d like to think it was
training, but it’s also the kind of peo-
ple they are."

Beefed out

Friday night.

Press Box

The Pitt men’s basketball team were denied a
second tournament trip to New York in a month
when Notre Dame topped the Panthers, 72-64

Sanft tabulated a long list of per-
sonal bests too long to mention here
but did say. “I was really pleased; we
didn’t have a bad event.”

Pitt’s vaulting scores totalled
46.25, which was built on the out-
standing efforts of Shirk (9.65),
Spector (9.4), Flock (9.25) and Mar-
tin (9.1).

Pitt performed to near-perfection
in the other events and rolled up
high scores on all four events. Sanft
said that her team had only two falls.
She explained that they were both

on the balance beam and caused lit-
tle trouble. Aside from these two
falls, Pitt hit six out of six routines
on the all other events.

Pitt came into the meet seeded
third and trailed both Penn State
and Ohio State for most ofthe meet.
But at half time with Ohio State
ahead by five-tenths, Pitt turned it
around and came rouring back on
the vault and bar exercises.

“Ohio State is a really good team.
It really boosted our team to be able
to look back and say we beat Ohio

March 26, 1984

State on a neutral floor with neutral
judges," Sanft said. “It was a good
thing we had bars last.”

Sanft used a peculiar strategy to
occupy her team during waiting
periods at regionals. She gave each
girl a coloring book and crayons.
The idea was to keep her team busy
and avoid butterﬂies, and according
to Sanft, it worked perfectly.

“When it was time for their events,
I had to tear the books out of their
hands. They all wanted to finish
their pictures.”

Karen Martin was named senior gymnast of the year at the Northeastern regional gymnastics tournament

held at Penn State.

Shirk, who was outstanding in her
events in spite of pain in her leg, said
that she was happy with the team’s
performance, “It was a nice way to
end the season.“

Despite her good performance at
regionals, there is still an outside
chance that Lisa Shirk will not qual-
ify for Nationals.

She said she is not worried and
believes that she will be selected. She
performed this weekend with
