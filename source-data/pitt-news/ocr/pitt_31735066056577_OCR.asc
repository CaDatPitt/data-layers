Stickup occurs at Craig Street News

By John Temple
Staff Writer

The stickup of Craig Street News in
South Oakland Monday afternoon
was the first of a series of four
armed robberies in the Pittsburgh
area.

Two men wearing hoods and ski
masks entered the store at 6:45 p.m.
waving handguns and yelling, “This
is a stickup!” according to store
owner Del Tarasovich.

Tarasovich was in the back of the
store, which is located near Centre
Avenuegat the time, but he came for-
ward when one of the robbers went

into another room of the store.

The robbers gained $500 from one
elderly customer, but only received
$1 from Tarasovich, who hid most of
his money before the robbers could
take it.

“One of them ran out front and
told everyone to empty their pock-
ets,” Tarasovich said. “I emptied my
pocket and threw a dollar down on
the ground.”

The men were very nervous and
ran out of the store less than a
minute after they had entered,
according to Tarasovich. Tarasovich

, ran after them and saw them leave in

a dark colored car.

The small store, located among a
small cluster of businesses, «has been
robbed seven times in the last five
years, three of the robberies occur-
ring in the last year.

“We’re wide open here. There’s no
one to protect us,” Tarasovich said.
“No cops walking a beat, nothing.”

Stores across the city have been
plagued with armed robberies this
year, and Pittsburgh City Police
announced yesterday that they

believe a gang of Homewood youths

are responsible for as many as 28

since Dec. 21. But police do not

think a gang committed last night’s

Specific units can make changes for disabled

Byjennifer N. Spagnuolo
Copy Editor ‘

The Office of Affirmative Action of the
University of Pittsburgh has announced to
all departments and schools that reason-
able accommodation requests from dis-
abled faculty and staff will first be the
responsibility of the unit involved.

William Savage, assistant to the chancel—
lor and director of Affirmative Action, said
that this is an attempt to address requests
made by individuals with disabilities for a
particular disability. Savage said that
accommodations often requested are:
improving wheelchair access in an office,
like putting the employee’s desk on risers
or redesigning the entrance of a reception
area so an employee can move around,
and placing a special device on a tele-
phone for a hearing impaired employee.

There is no office to directly address
these requests, so an employee of the uni-
versity may make a reasonable request for
an accommodation to his or her own unit.

“Some departments may not have ade-
quate resources to address the accommo-
dation needed,” Savage said.

When a particular unit cannot make the
accommodation for an employee the
request may go to a dean or department
head. If the matter still cannot be solved at
that level, it will be referred to a senior
vice chancellor or the chancellor. A request
may progress this far before any commit-
ment is made to making the change.

“I serve as the university’s 504 coordina-
tor,” Savage said, referring to the section in
the Federal Rehabilitation Act which
requires people who receive federal finan-
cial assistance to make reasonable accom-
modations for individuals with disabilities.

There are approximately 30 Pitt employ-
ees who have self—identified themselves
with a disability. “Some are visible and
some you wouldn’t necessarily know,”
Savage said.

“Disabilities run a gamut of those things
visual — like physically impaired or visual-
ly impaired — and hidden disabilities ——
cancer, epilepsy,” Savage said. “These peo-
ple have a right to make a request for a
reasonable accommodation.”

An unreasonable request is one that is
denied because a better alternative was
found to accommodate the employee or
applicant, like changing the ﬂoor the per-
son’s office is on instead of making many
alterations to the floor the person is on
currently.

The reasonableness of an accommoda-
tion request may be determined by 1) the

Five bands
to perform
at Graffiti
for Greeks

By Matt Groff
Staff Writer

If you enjoy the local
rock and roll scene,
Graffiti is the place to
be this Thursday night.

Five bands, four of
them local, are teaming
up with the Pitt Greeks
to present a benefit
concert for the Greek
Week charity,
Pennsylvania Special
Olympics.

One of Pittsburgh's
most popular bands, the
Clarks, is headlining the
event. Other performers
range from a progres-
sive rock band out of
Maryland to a band
formed by Pitt students.

“This is a great chance
for people to come to
one place to see five
good bands," Greek

Week fund-raising co—'

chairman Eric Shaivit/,
said. “On most other
nights people will go
out and spend just as
much to see only one or
two bands."

Shaivitz stressed that
even though it is spon-
sored by Greek Week,
the concert is open to
everyone.

“This is the first time
we sponsored a concert
like this," Greek Week
co-chairman Steve
Donofe said. “We're
hoping to get a big
turnout from the public
in support for these
bands, and especially
Pennsylvania Special
Olympics.“

Known for their main-
stream rock-‘n’-roll style
and original music, the
Clarks are veterans of

WPIC starts program
for depressed teens

By Katie Kaminski
Staff Writer

Each day an average of 18 American teenagers
between the ages of 15 and 19 commit suicide. For
each of these suicides, more than 500 teens attempt to
take their lives, according to Claudia Roth of Western
Psychiatric Institute and Clinic (WPIC).

Roth says the teen suicide rate has tripled over the
past three decades and now represents 12 percent of
the total mortality in this age group.

In response to this increase, WPIC, part of the
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, has initiated a
therapy program for teens, said Roth, who is the pro-
gram’s coordinator.

The Family and Individual Resources for Suicidal
Teens (FIRST) program, offers free treatment for ado-
lescents ages 13 to 18 who may be at risk for depres-
sion and suicide.

These teens may experience changes in sleep pat-
terns and appetite, decreased energy, problems in
school and persistent sadness or ir- ritability.

Treatment includes a complete psychiatric evalua-
tion upon enrollment, followed by 12 weeks of family
or individual therapy.

After evaluation, FIRST participants are assigned to

relax and listen to the vin-
tage, romantic music.

“When it comes to roman-
tic lyrics and melodies, it’s
hard to beat the 19th centu-
ry,” Jean Thomas, director of
the ensemble, said.

"Songwriters dealt exten-
sively with both the joys and
sorrows of romance. Many
of the songs on our program
are unabashedly sentimen-
tal, but that’s what
Valentine's Day is about.”

Nineteenth—century
Pittsburgh will come alive
through ballads written by
Stephen Foster, Ethelbert
Nevin and Victor Herbert.
There will also be a segment
of Scottish airs and songs
about various conveyances
linked with romance.

Dear Friends, which is cel-
ebrating its 10th anniversary,
is an ensemble that special—
izes in the pre—radio era, but

at this performance, songs
from the more recent past
will be included.

“Musical styles have
changed a lot over the past
150 years, but the basic
human emotions expressed
in the lyrics remain the
same,” Thomas said.

“What really fascinates us
is the ease with which you
can juxtapose Foster’s rnusi—
cal language with that of
Herbert, Sigmund Romberg
and later songwriters.”

Concert tickets cost $10
for adults, $7.50 for senior

Leave Chelsea alone    

Enough is enough already, it’s time to leave Chelsea
Clinton alone. Although the pressure on her is tremendous,
it is one thing to scrutinize a 13-year-old girl's school or cat
and another to make fun of her physical appearance.

Ever since President Clinton was elected to the nation's
highest office, much of the media has been harping on his
13-year-old daughter Chelsea. The frizzy hair and pimples,
the braces and the freckles have become popular subjects
with late night television hosts and political cartoonists.
Realistically, these are the things with which most 13-year-
olds have to deal; only most 13-year-olds don’t have “daddy”
running the country.

The mockery made of Chelsea Clinton has gone beyond a
blatant disregard for journalistic integrity and transcends
good humor. Even those like Arsenio Hall and Robin
Williams, who preach that we shouldn't judge people by
their appearances, have been among the first to jump on the
bandwagon and make fun of her.

Give the kid a break. It isn’t her fault she was pushed into
the national spotlight. It’s bad enough that she will have to
deal with gossip between her schoolhood peers — let alone
the fact that she will be subject to the far-from-flattering
depictions of major publications. We should be above the
petty namecalling that we so often preach against; and to do
it on national television goes too far.

We were all impressionable young 13-year-old children at
one time, and hopefully realize the tremendous social pres-
sures which exist to “fit in.” It is rather unfair to add doubt
to her own self—image,' especially when the criticism is nega-
tive. Besides, Chelsea is in her formative years, which means
she is probably drinking her milk. And we all know that
milk can do a body good.

A World legend

Throughout his life, Arthur Ashe was more than a tennis
player, much more. In 1970, Ashe began a campaign against
apartheid and broke down a color barrier in South Africa by
being the first black man to reach the finals in the South
African Open.

He topped off his tennis career in 1975 with a Wimbeldon
win. He was known for his strong serve, which won him
not only Wimbeldon, but also the United States and
Australian Opens‘.

He was one of the best tennis players in the world in his
day, but was his success as a tennis player as important as
his contributions to the ‘destruction of racial walls or his
efforts to make life easier for those afflicted with the AIDS
virus? The answer to that question is obvious.

Before he died, Ashe established a foundation to fight
AIDS, and he traveled to America's inner cities, building
tennis clinics to teach the value of discipline and sports-
manship. His contributions to society and community make
him more than the average sports figure.

He was an excellent tennis player, one of the best the
game" has seen. But foremost, he is the ideal hero, a man
who shirked the selfishness and exclusivity, commonly
associated with famous figures, for the benefit of his fellow
man.

News of his death may not have been a surprise, but much
of the country paused and reflected to mark the passing of
a man who gave his last days to the advancement of an
important cause.

I could teach that SGB a thing or two

On Monday night, the Student
Govemment Board met for about

an hour to discuss various issues. ‘

Unfortunately, the only thing
accomplished was a record-set-
ting level of boredom. This was
the first SGB meeting I ever
attended, and believe me, I didn't
expect unprecedented excite-
ment. Who would? Even so, I
was unprepared for the droll
spectacle presented by our lead-
ers.
At first, I thought, these really
are interesting topics because
they concern the students; it must
just be the fomialities that make it
tedious. Then, after they had
made it to new business, I real-
ized I was wrong. This is just
plain boring! Most importantly, it
was clear that the topics of dis-
cussion rarely, if ever, concerned
the majority of students.

The issues they did touch on
were straight out of Mad Libs.

First, Jacob Brody, SGB presi-
dent, addressed the concerns of
the Student Environmental Action
Coalition. SEAC supplied the
SGB with a packet of skewed
information about the Mt.
Graham project in Arizona. Acting
on this infomiation, Brody moved
to consider the issue and discuss
it with Chancellor O’Connor.
After the meeting, I discussed this
topic with Brody and found that
at present the SGB supports the
position held by SEAC, pending
information from the University of
Arizona and Pitt’s Astronomy
Department. If SEAC has its way,
Pitt will lose the opportunity to
participate in a benchmark astro-
nomical undertaking. One thing
is for sure, even if you don’t like
Brody, there’s no denying that he
is uncannily resilient. The abuse
heaped on him by the campus
media appears to have had little
effect on his stature. He’ll make a
fine politician someday.

Another issue was the the
need for an escort service. This
campus needs an escort service
like it needs a bigger administra-
tion. Open your eyes folks.
There’s so many Pitt busses and

shuttles buzzing around campus
that you’d be hard pressed to
walk a block without having one
of them roll by. Get a schedule
and quit complaining. This school

wastes enough money hauling‘

you around campus without hav-
ing escorts at your beck and call
night and day.

Another topic of discussion was
the need for a MAC machine in
Sutherland Hall. Sutherland
already has a cafeteria, a CIS
computer center and a whole

Chris
Diersen

basement waiting for projects
such as a convenience store. It
would be inhuman to give these
folks a MAC machine. College is
supposed to be a social experi-
ence. With an ATM and all the
other necessities of“ life,
Sutherland residents may never
see the light of day. Regardless,
Oakland's already loaded to the
gunwales with ATMs. Just hop a
shuttle!

According to SGB, a multicul-
tural center is just what our cam-
pus needs. SGB has already
established a multicultural chair.
One could have predicted this
calamity. Not that multiculturalism
(by the definition of the word) is
a bad thing. On the contrary, an
awareness of one’s ethnic back-
ground makes for a more well-
rounded individual.

Multiculturalism, though, as a
political or educational entity, is
quite dangerous. In educational
institutions, multiculturalism has a
grim history of trying to replace
the standards of literature with an
eclectic sampling of more mod-
em, sometimes esoteric, works -
all of them less than timeless.
Even more disturbing, multicul-
turalism teaches separatism. For
example, a multiculturalist tells a
young black man or woman that
his or her street jargon is as
appropriate as anyone else’s dic-
tion. While this may be true
amongst his or her peers, there is

nothing more damaging to his or
her chances of success in
America.

Telefact was mentioned (in
passing), and this is one issue
which I had hoped would be dis-
cussed in more depth. No such
luck. Telefact: There is no single
faction of this university which I
have heard more complaints
about. A common complaint goes
something like this: “I called
Telefact, and they put me on
hold (dropped the phone — no
hold button) for a century. That
wouldn't be so bad, but I could
hear them ﬁelding other calls in
the background! Oh, and it took
them a day and a half to get me
the address for David Letterman's
‘Viewer Mail.’” SGB should be
pushing for more efficiency in
this service, which coincidentally,
is run by our student monies.

Other issues included campus
lighting, racism and cultural
workshops, summer housing
problems, evil and malicious
Oakland landlords and random
phone surveys. My question:
Who Cares’

Why does the SGB ignore
issues of great importance to the
entire campus community, such
as our sad lack of computers and
miniscule weekend hours afford-
ed to people who need to use
diese computers. Computers are,
as much as I hate to say it, the
single most important tool-in
almost any successful career
today. Pitt’s computer situation is
pathetic compared to neighboring
schools, and SGB members
should be pressing for improve-
ment. Are they? No. They’re too
busy pestering O'Connor, trying
to force him to retard the growth
of our school by reneging on the
Mt. Graham project.

The SGB is there for you. Go to
the meetings and make a differ-
ence. We elected them, now we
have the responsibility of keeping
them on the straight and narrow.

Just thought I’d let you know.

Ice Cold

Pirates pound Panthers 91-73

Byjim Iakely
Managing Editor

E. RUTHERFORD, NJ. -
Among other things, New
York is famous for its some-
times violent atmosphere. Last
night in the Meadowlands, just
outside city limits, the Pitt
Panthers experienced that vio-
lence first hand.

the coach and the fans can
always count on to come
through when the chips are
down.

Pitt basketball is no
exception this season. On
the men‘s team, that clutch

On the women's team that
clutch player is lonna
Huemrich.

Hers is a storied car_eer

t h a t
h a s
proven
to be
not h —
i n g
s h o rt
of out-
stand-
ing.

The 6-foot forward from
Bethel Park, Pa., first burst
upon the Big East scene
during the 1990-'91 season,
when her efforts earned her
Big East Rookie of the Year
honors.

Huemrich continued to
excel her sophomore year,
during which she emerged
as one of the finest players
in the Big East. After captur-
ing tournament MVP honors
at two early competitions,
Huemrich went on to lead
the Panthers in scoring and
rebounding for the season.
She received further acco-
lades from the conference

in the second half that broke a
43-43 tie, and the backs of the
17th—ranked Panthers. Taking
control inside and making the
domination complete, Wright
played his best game of the
season, dropping in 16 points
and grabbing nine rebounds.

“Karnishovas played great
on both ends,” Evans said.
“He was great on the boards
[13 rebounds]. He didn’t sur-
prise me.”

Pitt hung tough with the
favored Pirates, entering the
locker room tied at 35 thanks
to the hot hand of Marion
Rhymes. The 6-4 Panther
guard came off the bench and
nailed four three—pointers en
route to collecting 14 points,
but all in the first half. \X/hen it
was clear that Karnishovas
could not be stopped, it was
just as clear that the Panthers
were going to lose this game.

“In the first half, Marlon
picked it up for us," Evans
said. “But in the second, we

had no one to pick it up.”

Seton Hall, on the other
hand, did. Pitt could not
defend the 6-8 forward from
Lithuania outside or when he
was driving the lane. To stop
Kamishovas the Panthers had
to foul him, and he made
them pay by nailing 12 of 13
free throws.

“Karnishovas was getting
points any way he wanted
them,” Evans said. “He is a
very smart player.”

After the Karnishovas point
parade, Pitt was looking at a
58-46 deficit, Chris McNeal on
the bench with four fouls and
no one stepping up to attempt
a comeback.

Point guard Jerry
McCullough began to take
matters into his own hands,
dr-ibbling quickly down the
floor and driving to the hoop
—- a technique that has
spelled success for the
Panthers in past games this

See Panthers, page 14

Pitt hoops hits wall, gets
run over by Seton Hall

By Jason Brame
Staff Writer

Pitt hit the wall —— no two
ways about it.

Tied at 35 at the break, head
coach Paul Evans took his team
into the locker room with a
small moral victory — compet-
ing in a less—than-beautiful dog-
fight with the Seton Hall Pirates
at the Meadowlands.

But the Pirates’ depth and tal-
ent emanated through a haze of
inconsistency as they stepped
past a first half filled with
empty baskets to fill up the
scorer’s sheet in a second half
runaway.

The Panthers couldn’t keep
pace.

Both teams were horrid from
the floor early, each shooting a
terrible 22 percent in the first
few minutes. But while Jerry
McCullough continued to suffer

through a slump that the
Chicago Cubs would be proud
of, Seton Hall’s Arturas
Karnishovas and Luther Wright
buried shot after shot, teaming
up to send the Panthers to their
third loss in four games.

McCullough has suffered the
past three games, watching his
shooting percentage and scor-
ing output drop into oblivion.
His floor play has not wavered,
however, as he continues to
provide steals and assists.

But the main difference last
night was that there was no one
around to pick up Ice’s slack.

Against Villanova, Andre
Alridge's Big East coming out
party, McCullough was benched
for the first-year point guard,
and despite notching 13 points,
was a non-factor.

Against St. John's Redmen
two-guard Ahmad Shareef

for her tremendous play, as *

she was named second-team
All-Big East.

This season, she was
picked for preseason first-
team All-Big East honors,
and Panther Coach Kirk
Bruce counts on her to be a
leader and a role model for
the team.

Amidst all these expecta-
tions, however, Huemrich
has managed to just play
her kind of basketball, and
she has delivered with the
big numbers.

At this point in the sea-
son, Huemrich leads the
Panthers again in scoring
and rebounding.

She has been the model of
consistency during a season
where consistency has been
a missing element for the
rest of the team.

Aside from her impressive
numbers, one of the most
valuable assets that
Huemrich brings to the
Panthers is resilience. Over
the course of previous sea-
sons, Bruce has been forced
to wrestle with nagging
injuries that have plagued
his teams.

Huemrich is a solid con-
tributor who has started
every single game that the
Panthers have played during
her career.

Still, above all, Huemrich
is the consummate team
player —— always devoted,
never satisfied.

“Coming into this season,”
Huemrich said, “I wanted to
have a better year than last
year. But I really don’t set

The NHL season is 1()
games more than halfway
done, and the Pens still ride
high above the rest of the
Patrick Division.

Although it’s late (just like
a Pitt report card), here’s
the Pens belated report card
by position.

Offense: B
Last Report: A

Without center Mario
Lemieux, the Penguins have
dipped to fifth in the scor-
ing department. Left wing
Kevin Stevens continues to
score at a high pace, while
right wing Rick Tocchet and
center Ron Francis continue
to provide competent two-
way play. Left wing Shawn
McEachern continues to play

well, though he has
dropped out of any consid-
eration for the Calder
Trophy. _

Still there have been some
disappointments among this
group of forwards. Left wing
Bob Errey, who once scored
26 goals, had only six at the
all-star break. Left wing
Troy Loney, never a huge
scoring threat, has only

Penguin grades still high despite numerous sick days

the old Swede come playoff
time.

Jim Pack and Paul Stanton
round out the regulars with
strong play. Both are plus
players and both have sur-
prisingly contributed to the
Pens’ offense (Paek has 16
points and Stanton has 15).

The problem for this unit
is the sixth blueliner. Peter
Ahola and Grant Jennings
haven’t been effective while
Brian Fogarty is once again
having drinking (and legal)
problems that have led
to his suspension by the
team.

An experienced defensive-
minded defenseman like
F.dmonton’s Craig Muni
or Toronto’s Jamie Macoun
could help.

The Penguins could
also look to minor leaguers

like Paul Laus, Greg
Andrusak, Todd Nelson or
Paul Dyck.

Who would have thought
that Ken Wregget would be
a dominant figure in goal
for the Pens. His play has
been borderline spectacular
while filling in for Tom
Barrasso. Barrasso, second
in the league in wins, is
likely to be back stopping
pucks soon. And when he
played earlier in the season,
he showed the league that
he is the game’s best goalie.

Indoor Lacrosse takes hockey off the ice

goalies.

The road production of Gigi?
Nope.

A cheap wrestling league?
Maybe.

Indoor lacrosse? Yup.

If you do not know (and
chances are you don’t), Pittsburgh
is the home of the Major Indoor
Lacrosse Leagues Bulls, a fran-

chise that currently stands at ()-3,
a distant last place, in its confer-
ence.

Indoor lacrosse is poor-man’s
hockey, a 1()<lollar excuse to go

Jason
Brame

to the Arena and see the Pens‘
banners. Billed as the fastest
game on two feet, the sport

employs teams of five players
each, racing up and down the
floor trying to put a rubber ball
(twice the size and almost as live-
ly as the Superball) into a net
about half the size of its hockey
counterpart.

If you could take hockey off
ice and make the puck bounce,
you‘d have indoor lacrosse. The
field is virtually the same as hock-
ey, and plexi-glass boards keep
shots in and beer out.

As a sport it is fun to watch.

notched 13 points in as
many minutes, and Garrick
Thomas netted a couple of
momentum-changing threes,
as they took the brunt of
the Panthers’ backcourt
offense on their shoulders.
McCullough was content in
piling up assists and strong
defensive minutes but suf-
fered in the points column.

But tonight no one was
there to spell McCullough as
he threw up miss after
painful miss. Rhymes posted
no points in the second
stanza and Thomas saw
very few opportunities to
help in the offense.

“In the first, Marlon
picked it up for us,” Evans

said. “In the second, we had
no one to pick it up.”

Ice’s team-leading 15
points are very misleading.
With the ball in his hands
for most of the second half,
his out-of-control, slashing
drives left him at the foul
line with 14 opportunities,
of which he converted on
11, to try to cut into an
obviously insurmountable
lead.

Rhymes, despite enjoying
a torrid first half in which
he single-handedly kept the
Panthers in the game, fell
asleep in the second as he
played “match this brick”

our famous sports songs: the
afore mentioned “Hey” song, “We
Will Rock You” and a song which
I have yet to identify but will not
stop bouncing around in my
head. All I could think of as these
tunes blared from a speaker 12
feet from my face was Zamphir
and his Pan Flute. ~

Secondly, the field is atrocious.
There are air pockets the size of
small horses in the Astroturf, and
the lines are painted on very
cheaply.

I know that the MILL is a very
low budget leagme, but it doesn’t
take much to invest a couple of
bucks in the vacu-seal.

 

Finally, a local deejay came
onto the field at halftime, and,
using the Buddy Ryan spin-
around—on-the—stick drill, gave
away two tickets to some func-
tion somewhere. It is expected
from an organization who is try-
ing to market itself to neophyte
fans, but it’s hard to take a
sideshow spectacle like this seri-
ously.

There are a few plusses to the
league, the biggest being that
there isn’t another one to rival it.

It has the brothers Gait, Paul
and Gary, who are the best things
to happen to lacrosse since the
Mayflower landed. The former
Syracuse stars currently reside

one-two among the scoring lead-
ers. Famous for spectacular goals,

they are their own highlight reels,"

notching goals sometimes from
behind the crease.

No one is trying to fool the
public into thinking that this is
the big sport on the horizon,
because it is not. But if you enjoy
hockey and liked indoor soccer’s
antics, the Bulls may be some-
thing that you might like to check
out.

Besides, we’ve got to fill our
time between tractor pulls some-
how, right?

many goals for myself. I
just do what I have to do
to help my team, whether
that means score more
points, grab more
rebounds or whatever.”

But by her own assess-
ment, Huemrich does not
believe that she has
always done what she
has needed to do to help
her team.

“I have been frustrated
with myself a lot,"
Huemrich said. “After
each loss, I ask myself
‘What didn’t I do?‘ But
we’re having a much
better year this year than

we did last year, and

that’s what’s most impor-.

tant.”

As she has progressed

Huemrich has assumed
the leadership role that
all great players have
placed upon their shoul-

ders. To Huemrich, lead-
ership of the Panthersis
not a one—person job.

“Coach Bruce says I
need to be a leader,”
Huemrich said. “I like
that position since I am a
very competitive person.
But I am not the only
leader. If I get down,
someone else will step up
to pick up the slack. So
the leadership is divid-
ed.”

Still, Huemrich said she
feels the weight of her
responsibility to her
team.

“I feel a lot of responsi-
bility and pressure,”
Huemrich said.
“Sometimes I try to do
too much. forcing things
that aren't there, and that
hurts the team. I think it's
all in my head. I make it

ly is. I need to reali’/.e

The Sports Writers’ meeting is Friday at 3:00 p.m. It will be held in room

that I can’t do everything.
Wlien I force things, I get
out of my game. That’s why
I will sacrifice points for
defense to help the team
win.”

Huemrich said the biggest
high of the season was
the stunning comeback
against Georgetown at
Fitzgerald Field House last
month.

“We came back from 19
points down to pull it out,”
Huemrich said. “Everybody
pulled together and made it
happen. That showed our
mental toughness and the
kind of play we are capable
of.”

It was during that victory
over the Hoyas that
Huemrich achieved her most
recent accomplishment ~-
the 1,000-point plateau.
Huemrich said that she
has other things on her
mind at this point of the
season.

“I didn’t know I was even
that close [to 1.000 pointsl,"
Huemrich said. “When they
stopped the game, I was
really surprised. I feel good
about it. No question it‘s
a great honor. I appreciate
it.

"Maybe one day I’ll look
back on it and remember it
fondly, but that is not the
most important thing to me
right now.”

Huemrich believes that
consistency will be the key
if the Panthers hope to con-
tend down the stretch for
the Big East title.

Pitt was the hottest team
in the Big East earlier
this season. The Panthers
have cooled off a great deal
since then, having dropped
four of their last five to
conference foes. Huemrich
said she is confident
that the Panthers can come
back from this current
slump.

"We got off to a great
start, and we've shown that
we can play at any level,"
Huemrich said. “Physically,
we’re as good as any team
in the Big East. But the sea-
son starts to wear on you a
bit by this time, and maybe
we've given a little mental-
ly.

"But we’re on our way
back. In practice I can see
our intensity returning. It's
just a matter of what team
shows up to play for each
game.”

I-Iuemrich said she hopes
to help her team get
back on track as the
Panthers return home to the
friendly confines of
Fitzgerald Field House to
face the Villanova Wildcats
tonight at 7:30.

season. But he was slumping
and the plan did not work.
The effort did give a glimpse
of the old McCullough — the
one that was being called the
best point guard in the con-
ference a few weeks ago.

He finished the game with
15 points, 11 from the free-
throw line, but was only two
of 13 from the floor and () for

~ seven from three-point range.

“]erry’s shooting was hor-
rendous,” Evans said. “His
shots weren’t going in, but he
does everything so well, he
still did a good job.”

making sure it stayed shut.

He battled hard with Pitt
center Eric Mobley inside and

‘won those battles almost

every time in the second half.
He racked up points inside
and displayed a new-found
touch away from the basket
to help make sure the Seton
Hall lead stayed above 10

game.

Dehere (who himself was a
less-than—impressive five of 20

' from the floor) and made none

of the four shots he put up.

Thomas also gave no aid to
the eight—leading scorer in the
Big East, hitting neither of his
two attempts during his seven
minutes on the floor.

McCullough sat for much of
the first period as Rhymes
knocked down 14 points,
including four three-pointers
and a slashing bucket.

But his lack of playing time
was a direct result of not foul
trouble, but his frigidity from
the field.

The Panther interior offense
was average at best and did
not lend much help. Power
forward Chris McNeal spent
most of the second half suck-
ing on a water bottle with four
fouls, and Antoine Jones was
virtually nonexistent.

Eric Mobley. however,
showed a versatility not seen
in several games —-— he hit a

turn—around jumper. But, other
than :1 few highlight film dunks
and a nifty look-off, foul—induc-
ing pass to Jones, the center
did not contribute that much.

It would be incorrect to say
that Pitt was confused or sur-
prised by Seton Halls defen-
sive schemes. The Panthers
found the open shots on the
perimeter, they just did not
convert.

It's that simple.

Power Play: B

Last Report: A

Without Lemieux, the
power play is just average.

Stevens and Tocchet (17
and 16 respective power
play_ goals) just aren’t
the same without the “Big
Guy” setting them up with
the man advantage.

Murphy continues to do a
good job of running the
point while Ron Francis
alternates between the left
point and center.

Still, a real pointman (like

l)etroit’s Nicklas Lidstrom or
Vancouver’s Doug Lidster)
would be beneficial with or
without Lemieux in the line-
up.

Penalty Killing: C

Last Report: C+

Once more, Lemieux’s
absence hurts the Pens here.
Lemieux is the game’s best
penalty killer and he can’t
be replaced. Still, Francis,
Stapleton and Dave Tippett
have done a respectable job
as have the defensemen.

Overall Grade: B+

Last Report: A-

The Penguins still lead the
NHL in points, but it may
just be a matter of time until
Montreal passes them by.

But still, without Lemieux,
the Pens are one of
the game’s best teams,
and they’re capable of win-
ning the Stanley Cup
without him. Hopefully,
they won’t have to find that
out.
