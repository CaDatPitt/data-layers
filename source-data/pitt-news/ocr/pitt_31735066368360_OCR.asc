Two Employees Fired

0rganizingAttempt Stirscontroversy  

a By MARK‘ A. SlNDLERi

Two "University Book Center
employees were recently fired "and
three were suspended for one day
from their jobs for what ' they
believe are their efforts to organize
a union. within the bookstore.

On Jan. 7, Chuck Delaney and‘ ~

Tim Brady were escorted out of a
back door by campus security offic-
ers and were later told that they
‘were indefinitely suspended. On
Jan. 18,‘ Pitt permanently fired
them both from the book center.

Delaney and Brady still do not
know why theyxwere fired, and uni-
versity officials either refuse to
comment or are unavailable to
release any information on the
matter.

The matter centers around a
number of bookstore employees
who want to establish their own
union within the store. A current
employee, who requested anonym-
ity, said he and six other colleagues
met around the middle of

December to organize a union-card
signing effort. '

“Around the middle of the
month, I started distributing union
cards on a Friday, and by the fol-
lowing Monday, we had 23 cards
signed and returned," he said.
That's over one-thirdlpf the staff.

“Then, one day after this, I was
given a disciplinary report by
James Crowley (a book center
supervisor) and was told I was sus-
pended for one day without pay.

' I'm also on 35-day probation now
until February 16 or 17.”

The bookstore employees, for
the last month and a half, have
been represented by Dan Kaufman,
an attorney. Representing the
employees and their attempt to be
recognized by Pitt as Local 101 of
the Retail Wholesale Department
Store Union, Kaufman has already
filed a grievance with the Pennsyl-
vania Labor Relations Board
(LRB).

“Two employees have already
filed under the university’s griev-
vance procedure," Kaufman

:

explained, “and that's about all
they can do now. If they go to court,
this would be unfeasible because

. they would have to bear the cost of
_an arbitrator and an attorney.

“They’re only making min-
imum wage, though."

Kaufman ‘was recently con-
tacted and asked to represent book-
store employees becayse ‘of what he
believes is a “deplorable package"

they are now receiving. The card

signing that took place is manda-
tory under Pennsylvania law_ for
any union establishment, after
which the LRB hold aghearing on
the matter. '

After more bureaucratic tape is
unsnarled, and if the LRB votes in
favor of the union, bargaining for
wages and benefits can then oc“cu,r.

University officials currently
refuse to commenton the suspen-
sions or terminations. Vice-
chancellor for administration Jack
-Freeman was out of town for the
weekend and unavailable for com-
ment. Book center manager Mary
Bonach and Peter Sollento refused

game against Seton Hall. Weinschenkerphoto

to answer any Pitt News
questioning. .

Joseph A. Dutton, Vice-
chancellor of business and finance,
acknowledged that “(the two
employees) are appealing this,"
but further stated that he had no
more to say.

According to Kaufman, the
employees are looking to form a
union in an attempt to better their
wages and benefits. While most
employees are represented by the
Services Employees International
Union (SEIU), the bookstore
workers are among the few that
still rec_eive -minimum wages
because of their non-representa-
tion. .

Kaufman released financial fig-
ures of SEIU employees as a refer-
ence point in comparing salaries.

“Under contract, a porter dish-
washer at the Lothrop Cafeteria ‘
receives $6.15 an hour," Kaufman
explained. “A man who works in

grounds is paid $5.97 per hour and

Job Market
Bleak for
Graduates

Job opportunities have been
on the decline since the turn of
the decade, according to Robert
Hopkins, director of the Pitt
Job Placement Center. “Things '
will probably get worse before
they get better in l983,” he said.

1, The reason for the decline is
linked. to the hard times of
American businesses. Because
of the recession, companies are
being forced to cut back on their
spendings. As a result, there is
less money available for the hir-
ing of new workers. .

Although the outlook on the
job market appears bleak for the
near future, it is certainly not
hopeless, Hopkins said. Liberal
arts graduates will probably be
affected the most by the decline.

According to Hopkins, there
is a higher demand for gradu-

A star may be born tomorrow
night at David Lawrence Audito-
rium. Yes, tomorrow at 8:00 p.m.,
the Pitt Program Council is spon-
soring the first ever Student Talent
Night.

The grand prize of the contest is
a trip to New ‘York City and a
chance to perform at “Rick New-
man’s Catch a Rising Star Club.”
The runner‘-up winner will get the
opportunity to perform next week
at Pitt, when three comedians from

.\ Catch a Rising Star Club stage a
comedy show.

1‘ The show is sponsored by Miller
Lite and the Catch a Rising Star
Club, said "en tertainment chairper-
son Tim Woolheater. “Catch a Ris-
ing Star williprovide the master of

ceremonies for the talent night,”
Woolheater said. _

Tommorow night’s emcee is a
36-year old comedienne who bills
herself as a “bag woman” or
“gypsy” comic—Adrianne Tolsch.
To1'sch’s comic mold is a cross
between the put-down artist and
the jovial masochist. Part of her
repertoire might include jokes
such as: ’

“If my hair gets any worse, I’m
going to need Moses to part it,” or,
“This is a designer outfit. Pierre
Cartoon put it together."

Woolheater emphasized that the
talent night is really not a contest,
it is more of an “open stage” or
“coffee house” type of event.

Eight acts were chosen out of the
14 that auditioned for the contest.

_Each of the acts wi1l_1ast approxi-
,mately 10 minutes, and between

acts, the emcee will stage five min-
ute stints.

Woolheater thought that, as the
first talent night, it would be a flop.
“The deadline for applications was
last Thursday, and on Wednesday,
we didn’t have one application,”
he said. “I was pretty surprised
when we received 16 applications,
all on Thursday.”

According to Woolheater, all the
acts judged at last Tuesday’s audi-
tions were all “Quality acts.” Some
of the student acts include piano
players, singers and a ventrilo-
qtgst. ‘

"‘I really didn’t want to cut any of

the acts that auditioned, they 'were_

all good. However, I had to because
there was just not enough time in
the show,” Woolheater said.

Tickets for the Student Talent _

Night are free with ID at the door.

estimates show that 90-95 per-
cent of the placement center’s
graduating engineers found’
jobs in 1982; 75-80 percent of
the graduating computer
science majors were employed;
and 40-45 percent of the liberal
arts majors found employment.

With the job opportunities
on the decline, the placement
center is becoming increasingly
valuable aid to Pitt graduates.
The centerscomputer system~
not only makes it easy to
account for job-seeking gradu-
ates, but also makes it conve-
nient for companies seeking
employees.

The placement center cannot
promise anyone a job, but it
does relieve some of the burden
by correlating companies with
jobs, contacting, them and set-
ting up interviews, Hopkins
said.

Organizing Attempt

_ continued from page one
an elevator dispatcher‘ makes $6.54

' an hour.

“A groundskeeper makes $7.57
per hour. Now don’t get me
wrong," Kaufman added, “these
are honorable positions; I’m proud

"of the fact that they have these

wages, but a majority of the staff at

the bookstore only make $3.35.
“These are probably the lowest-

paid people that sell the highest-

I priced items.”

I Some of those employees have
been with the bookstore for 15 years
on a full-time basis and work about
37 hours per week.

Delaney, in his eighth year, saw
the potential for a union as “basi-
cally trying to get some representa-
tion. Tim (Brady) and I were
singled out and were pretty popu-
lar (at the book center). Then they
laid it on us.

“It’s as if the university is fearful
of me,” Delaney said. “I didn’t
think they needed that kind of mus-
cle. I don't even know what the hell
the reason was.”

Another of the suspended
employees, Norma Dothard, has
filed a grievance with Pitt for what
she thinks is a lame‘ excuse.
Another eight-year employee,
Dothard completed her normal
work day recently, but refused to

work overtime.

“I feel something should be
done," Dothard said. “I have veri-

cose veins, and I also stand and lift ‘

a lot and then they suspend me. I
feel this is not the proper way.
They gave me no warning or any
discipline.

“I want justice done for what
they did to me. They docked my
pay, and I want it back.”

Pitt's grievance system-does" not
receive high commendations‘from

Kaufman. He it's too
exaggerated.

“The university brags about its
grievance procedure,” Kaufman
said. “But it's really nothing. It
doesn't work. I've been told that no
one at the bookstore has ever been
honored a grievance."

Delaney and Brady cannot even
receive "unemployment benefits.
The state employment office ear-
lier contacted Pitt to determine the
reason behind the terminations.
Pitt refused to release any details.

Consequently, Kaufman has
filed an unfair labor practice suit
with the LRB, but believes that it
may be weeks before the board ever
comes to a decision.

“The LRB will investigate,"
Kaufman said, “and can then put
them back to work for full back pay
if it rules favorably. Right now,
though, I do not know (the
employees’) chances." C

One of the fired employees,
Brady, believes he was “done in"_by
his supervisors.

“I feel that I went into Pitt ready
to be a productive employee and to
help out and to make suggestions
for improvement,” he said. “It’s

says

caused personal distress for me to"

be taken out (of the bookstore) by
the police.

“I just find it very odd for this to
be going on at a state university
where there areeducators and this
type of activity goes on. It’s scary."

Brady is not alone in his convic-
tions. A current employee request-
ing anonymity said, “I heard one of
the supervisors told another
employee that (he) better stop
(union organizing) because the
bookstore is under martial law.

“It’s a way of intimidating other
people. It ‘sounds like the same
thing in the ‘Norma Rae’ movie.”

New Running Club Formed '

By D.J. CASE

There is a new club on cam-
pus whose goal is to “take off
running”—running.- off that
excess baggage. ' Q

;The Pitt Running Club is
looking for. people to get
together and share some fun
and exercise. Members don’t
need any running experience,
only the desire to run, accord-
ing to club treasurer Steve
Smith. '

“Our goal is not to compete,
but to get people together and
make running more accessi-
ble—expecially for women who
are afraid to run alone," Smith
explained.

The 25-member club was
started by five friends who were
runners in high school, Smith

said. However, "because it was
founded only a week ago, most
ideas are still in the planning .
stage. ~

One idea that the club is
working on is the Sunday
morning fun run. Interested

I runners will meet at a desig-

nated location around 10:30.
“We’d like to pair people

V together and have experienced

runners take the newcomers out
and show them the different
trails,” Smith said. “The Oak-
land area is..not conducive to
running because ofthe traffic
and stop lights——and it's also
better to run with someone
rather than alone.

Most trails are in Schenley
Park, according to Smith, and
weave back and forthand can be
confusing. In order to alleviate
that confusion, the club's
fo_unders have put together a

.booklet which contains maps of
the different trails and course ,

distances, as well as various
stretching exercises. »

Another idea being tossed-

around by the members is to
hold a race based on New York
City’s Fifth Avenue Mile. It will
be called Pitt’s Fifth Avenue
Mile and will be held on a
closed off section of the avenue

this spring.

The club is also planning
and co-sponsoring ' a major
event called “The Not-So Great
Race,” 21 take off of Pittsburgh's
Great Race. The race was
started two years ago by the Res-
ident Student Association.
“The Not-So Great Race” will
have two entries—a three-mile
course and a‘ six-mile course.
The race will take place in
March and will be open to stu-
dents, faculty andstaff.

By JILL SAVITZ

For the first time in 10 years,
the Louis Falco Dance Com-
pany will bring the theatricality
and energy that is its trademark
to the stages of Pittsburgh. The
company will perform its blend
of classical ballet and modern
dance on Thursday, Jan. 27 at 8

_ p.m. in the Syria Mosque.

."g.<

In America, Falco is perhaps
best known for his choreo-

graphy of the MGM feature.

film Fame, but in Europe, the
company is widely recognized
because of television. In l98l, it
created a series of six programs
and an hour and a half special

entitled Superfalco for RAI-TV _

Channel 1, the Italian national
network.

These performances came at
a time when the company was
performing. more in Europe
and less in the U.S. The trend

toward Eufropean tours didn't
stem from the company's desire
to see theworld, though.rIt was
a necessity because of cuts in
grants from the’ National

- Endowment of the Arts, a
source of much of the group's '

funding.

“It became impossible to per-
form here," said associate direc-
tor and principal dancer Juan
Antonio in a telephone inter-
view. He said that Falco, who

I usually _ tours V with the com-

pany, is busy in Italy once
again, this time choreograph-

ring a ballet based on the life of

Leonardo Da Vinci. _ '

The company will remain in
this country to do a 10-week
tour of the U.S. and Canada,
beginning Thursday in Pitts-
burgh. It will then tour Europe
for six weeks before returning to
New York in August.

According to Antonio, there

is .quite a difference in .Euro-
pean and American audiences.

“In the States, the audiences
are more contained. They've
been exposed to this kind of
dance before,” he said. “In
Europe, they don't see this kind
of dancing. The response is
wild because it's~so different

from anything they've seen"

before." ‘ .

Although he said he enjoyed
performing for television
because of the exposure it
offered, Antonio said, “There is
nothing like live performance.

There is an energy exchange.

between the audience and the
company that is so incredible it
can't be replaced by any
camera.” '

Antonio said he is looking
forward to being on the road.
“I’ve been on the road twenty
years, and I love it," he said.
“Whoever is a natural dancer

must have a gypsy mentality.
Everyone in the companydoes;
we are all very strong, inde-
pendent individuals." ‘

Antonio and another
member of the company, Wil-
liam Gornel, occasionally cho-
reographiballets, but all _of the
works in T hursday’s perfor-
mance are Falco's. In addition
to choreographing for his com-
pany for the past l5 years, Falco
has created ballets for other
companies, including the Aus-
tralian Ballet, the Boston Ballet
and Les Ballets jazz de Mont-
real, which performed at. Pitt
last fall. -

The Louis.Falco Company is
being sponsored by the Arts
Committee of the Pitt Program
Council. According to Chair-
person‘ Jan Kibler, “We consi-
dered bringing Les Ballets Jazz
back this year because they were

' such a success last year, but we
couldn't book them, and we 4

decided it would be ‘better to
give the students more of a var-
iety anyway."

' Even though there area lot of
_dance companies in this area
which students have-the chance
to see, Kibler said, “One of our
objectives is to bring programs
to Pitt that students can't see.
This company is from New
York--they're visible. Bringing
them in gives students a chance
to see something different in
dance."

» Kibler said she thinks the
company will be well received
because of its wide appeal.
“You don't have to be an ‘expert
on dance to appreciate this
company," she said.

Tickets for the performance
are available at the ticket office
on the third floor in_ Forbes
Quad. They are free to all Pitt
students with a validated I
and $5 for all others. ‘

  Enforcing  

Compliance

Who would have suspected it—U.S. education sec-
retary Terrel Bell is a policeman at heart?

The Department of Education recently announced
a proposal that would require young men‘ seeking

l
K

federal loans for college to prove that they have reg-- '

istered for the draft. The rule is intended to increase
the rate of compliance with the registration law.

The idea of linking college aid to performance of
military service responsibilities is nothing new. A
familiar proposal surfaces from time to time that
college aid should be granted only in return for
several years of military service. Because under
current law.only registration and no actual draft is
involved, it might seem that the Education
Department plan is just a softer version of this
“exchange’ ’ idea.

The two plans, however, are different in very
important ways. An exchange policy is based on the
reasoning that young men serve their country and, in
return, receive direct government aid for their
educations. It represents a comprehensive
government plan to provide one valuable service in

- exchange for another. The Education Department’s

plan is simply a move to enforce compliance with
Selective Service laws.
There is no exchange involved in the Education

V plan. It is not clear why registering for the draftiis a

service to the country. Americans have forgotten that
registration was a response to an imminent threat to
security, perhaps because that threat no longer exists.
The right to apply for a student loan does not
compare, either, with the full grant offered by a full-
fledged exchange policy. _

Most ‘importantly, the Education plan raises
questions about the roles of the Department of
Education and the Selective Service Administration.
Is the rate of compliance with the registration law so
low that departments like Education must play a
policeman’s role? Will Education now be the office
to which to turn when other agencies need help
enforcing the law? ’

The Education Department has taken a large step
outside of the work for which it was intended into the

unrelated ‘ fields of ' law enforcement and draft.

registration. Those may, arguably, be legitimate
government jobs, but not legitimate Education jobs.

,Let’s leave policing to the police.

Their Real Motives

By PEGGY FERRI

Environmentalists, those
bothersome people concerned
with such trivialities as clean
air, safe water and huge tracks
of land, are really in a class by
themselves. I wouldn't have
been able to understand the
threat that they pose to our
society if Secretary of the Inle-
rior James Watt hadn't pointed
this out in a recent and enlight-
ening interview for Business
Week.

Iiknew all the time that per-
sons concerned about nuclear
war were nothing more than
innocents led astray by the .
KGB, or so Reagan tells us, but V
I wasn't aware of the similarity
between environmentalists and
Nazis and Bolsheviks.

Yes, they are an especially
tricky group, but not too tricky
for quick-as-a-whip Watt.
“Environmental critics are pur-

" suing the greater objective of '

the central control of society as
did the Nazis and Bolsheviks,”
according to Watt.

He was quoted as saying that
such groups were using envir-
onmental concerns as a tool to
achieve centralized planning

and control of society. And

proof? Just draw from history-
as we know,——as we_ know,
those who pay no attention to it
are doomed to repeat it, some-
thing that Watt will ensure
doesn't happen.

"“Look what happened to
Germany in » the 1930's," he
said. “The dignity of man was
subordinated, to the powers’ of
Nazism. The dignity of_man
was subordinated in Russia.

Those are the forces that this
thing can evolve into." (The
New York Times, January 21).

Like any right minded Amer-
ican, I want it known that I dis-
agree’ strongly ,with the
“bleeding hearts" who have
commented on Watt’s common
sense, or lack thereof. It is not
time.for the men in _the white
coats to take Watt away as some
people hiding out in those
nature groups have charged.
Evidence that Watt’s accusa-

‘ tions hitfthe mark is abundant‘,

and anyone who ‘reads Reader’s
Digest should know that.

He knows. that those con-
cerned about the 208,000 gal-
lons of "radioactive cooling
water dumped into the Tennes-
see River are disguising their

“greater objectives” and are'not

truly concerned. In addition, all

' the crabs that are dying for some
reason and the fact that they live_

in the water near a California
plant merits absolutely no
further investigation. Worries
that 100 sites in Missouri may
be ‘contaminated by dioxin are

easily dismissed now that we '
_ understand the real motives of

those involved.

Watt is warning America of
the tactics these extremists are
us-ing—and we would do well
to take note.

It is so evident, in fact, that

people who claim to care about -

a healthy environment with
drinkable water are agents of
the dark forces that we don’t
need James Watt to keep
reminding us. He might as well
just shut up. ‘

But they couldn't seem to find

When they were students, both of
them took out student loans from
the federal government. Both of
them managed to “forget" to pay it

That's a flagrant abuse of the

financial aid system. In an effort to

eliminate this kind of abuse, the
federal government is attempting
to corral individuals who have not

One of the government’s easier
targets is its own employees. Fed-
eral employees who have not paid
back their student loans can expect
15 percent of their paychecks to be
withheld by the government-

$68 million of student loan funds.
In all, 800,000 ex-students have

students.

In December, the government
decided. to go after the defaulters
and theU.S. Department of Educa-
tion mailed letters telling them to
work out a repayment schedule
within 60 days.

If the errant defaulters do not set
up a payment schedule, then in 60
more days they will see deductions
in their paychecks.

The state government is follow-
ing the path blazed by its big
brother.

The Pennsylvania Higher Edu-
cation Assistance Agency knows of
more than 1,100 state employees
who owe more than $2.3 million in _
student loans.

Last month, Gov. Dick Thorn-
burgh signed a law permitting the
withholding of wages from any

” state employee who has defaulted
on a loan.

With federal and state funding to
higher education growing scarce,
the money collected from the
defaulters could help students
complete their educations. A con-
tract ,is—a contract and students
should not be able to borrow
money from the government and-
then not repay it. A

“But government employees
make up only about 6 percent of
those who have not. repaid their

loans. Collecting their money
won't make a dent in the default
rate unless the government goes
after other loan deadbeats as well.

_,,Lad y Panthers Split’

In WeekendiGames

By TAMMY ANDERSON

The Lady Panther Basketball I

team lost to West Virginia Satur-
day, 84-66, then came back to defeat
Boston University yesterday, 75-74.

The Panthers have had trouble
with the Lady Mountaineers lately,
especially when the game is played
in Morgantown. Pitt guard
Rhonda Gibbs said before the
game, “Playing at West Virginia is
always tougher because they have

§_-_ the wildest fans. The game will be a

tough one. However, myself and
the team are really fired up for the

« game. We have to be.”

Pitt’s “fire” was dimmedby the
Mountaineers in what could be
called an over-powering victory.
West’ Virginia had four players
score in double figures. Only Tri-
"Captain Jennifer Bruce accom-
plished that for Pitt, scoring 14
points.

“WVU always gives us a hard

time,” said Pitt assistant coach‘

Carol Dugan. 1“They have several
big girls who can be very effective

‘x .3‘ on both offense and defense.

“However,” she added, “we did
not play up to our potential. We
tended to rush things instead of
being patient." '

With the loss behind them, the

_, Panthers took on a physical Boston

 .\-

University team yesterday. Pittgot

off to a sluggish start. The tired ~

Panthers trailed 21-l2 midway
through the first half, as Pitt’s two
leading scorers’, Pam Miklasevich
and Bruce, only scored four points
between them by this point. Then
Miklasevich found her touch and
the Panthers began closing the
gap. Scoring by Miklasevich and
freshman Kim Gannis enabled Pitt
to close to within two points of the
Terriers by halftime.

The Lady Panthers came/ out

charging in the second half behind , -

a balanced scoring attack by Mik-
lasevich, Gannis,/Bruce and sopho-
more Becky Maziarz. A full court
press and an efective fastbreak
offense enabled Pitt to score some
easy baskets and to boost itself to a
62-52 lead.

But, Pitt’s fatigue from the hectic

weekend showed itself as the Terri- -

ers brought the game to within a
few points difference on aggressive
play and key scoring by Stephanie
Rahming and—Mary O'Connor.

The intensity grew. Alternating
fouls and turnovers by both teams
resulted in a 70-70 tie with a minute
left. Two fouls by Boston enabled
Bruce and Tirik to score four
points from the foul line.

With five seconds left, Rahming
canned a shot that made the final
score 75-74. 2 V

Panthers Sink Pirates,   78-68’...

Itmay have taken four futile

 For

By TODD ERKEL

It was a relaxed and smiling
Clyde Vaughan who sat in front
of his locker Saturday night.

, Staring up at reporters, he said,
. “people out there tonight might

not realize it, but this is history
right here-—our‘ first win in the

' Big East.” .-

It didn't look historic, the
Panther’s 78-68 win over loss-
weary Seton Hall. Significant
yes, but “hardly artistic or
dramatic in the way history is
meant to be. '

Esthetics aside, the victory
may prove to be-——as some of
the Pitt players are calling
it—-the biggest game of the
season. J

What? A 10-point win over a
3-12 Seton Hall team—that
hasn’t won on the road since the
Carter Administration-—the
biggest game of the season?

This was a big win, in that the
loss to Georgetown-, for all its
valor and showering of respec-
tability, was still a loss and once
the good feeling had parted,
only that bad tasting fact
remained.

Pitt not only needed and
wanted to beat Seton Hall, they
were expected to do no less and

game on the road for two

years'—would challenge the
Panthers instead of lying down.
The Pirates actually held a brief
one point lead during the early
stages of the first half, andthe
game was tied 14-14 as late as
the 10:56 mark. I ‘

But the‘Panther defense took
control of the game. A
Culbertson steal turns into a
Vaughan basket. George Allen
steals off Kevin Boyle at half-
court and goes in for a layup.
The next time down court Chip
Watkins blocks a shot and
Vaughan hits a short jumper.

Two fourshots by Allen and a

long jump by ‘Vaughan are hit
before Pirates center Tom.
Brown cans an eight-foot»
jumper, ending the Panthers’
string at 12 unanswered points.
Two more jumpers by Vaughan

increase the lead to 30-16.

as their Panther football friends
could tell them, just knowing
that creates problems of its
\ own. ' .
This first Big East victory
then marks a giant step toward
maturity forlthe young Panthers
and leading the march aretwo
players, Billy Culbertson and
Trent Johnson, whom many,
including a candid coach Roy
Chipman, had resigned to the
back of the line.

“I know that we gave up on 8

him too soon,” Chipman said
‘of Culbertson who pumped in a
career high 21 points Saturday.
“We made the mistake of
thinking we had to play a big
guard.” *

‘As for the 6-7 Johnson, all
he’s done of late is score in
double figures in four straight
games and rebound with a
fervor that lead those leaving
the Capital Centre to ask.
“what happened’ _to what’s his
name in the gray T-shirt.”

The consensus around the
Pitt camp is that Johnson has
undergone a transformation

_ that rivals Lazarus’ climb from

the dead. While everyone else
attributes his -turnaround to
recently having been named co-

Then the 6-4 forward put _

the coup de grace on the first
half when he took a Johnson

pass and threw in an uncon-_.-

tested reverse dunk, sending the
crowd into a frenzy. Pitt left the
court with a standing ovation
and a 36-22 lead.

“We picked up our intensity
on defense, and because of that,
we were getting steals ‘and
running more,”

_R9y Chipman said.
“It was a case of both teams’ -‘

fighting to take control of the

tempo of the game and our

defense did it for us.”

“I thought Pitt played well A
defensively, but we had people ’

captain, Johnson disagrees.
V “I don’t think that’s what
changed it around,” Johnson
said. “I just said, ‘hey, we’re in
the Big East now and we’re
going to face quality teams
every night.’ ” -

Chipman called upon his only
senior to take some of the
weight off of junior Vaughans’
wide, but heavily burdened,
shoulders. Vaughan, inherently
shy, never grew accustomed to
the widely held notion that as
Clyde goes, so goes Pitt
basketball.

The plays of both Johnson
and Culbertson, along with
steady help off the bench from
freshman Joey David and Keith
Armstrong, have dispelled the
idea that this team resembles a
big star being followed around
by four valets.

“Actually, when he
(Vaughan) was out of. the
offense, we were up l8,”
Chipman said following
Saturday’s win. Pitt’s lesser-
knowns shot a healthy_55
percent from the floor in the
second half. Culbertson and
Johnson combined for 25 of the
team’s 42 points.

Undefeated Gymnasts Win Again

By CHARLIE O'HARA

In what was predicted by north-
ern Virginia papers "to be a very
close competition, the Panther
gymnasts dominated a field of five
teams at James Madison University
on their way to increasing their
record to 6-0.

Led by junior Frank Kratz, who
won the All-Around champion-
ship (52.8), the Panthers totalled
261.5 points while defeating 21st
ranked North Carolina State
(248.9), ‘William and Mary (247.4),
James Madison (243.2) and Univer-
sity of Virginia (240.1).

It was clear after the- opening

event——the rings—that the Pan-
thers were in control. They opened
a seven ‘point lead which wasnever
contested. As early as the fourth
event, there was no possibility for a_
comeback by any of the opposing
teams. 

Concerning the highly touted
Wolfpack gymnasts, Panther head
coach Frank D’Amico said, “Last
year they came to the meet with one
objective—beat Pitt. The same atti-
tude was present this year.

“They are as talented as we are.
‘but they cpntinually tried tricks
that were too difficult. It was a big
win for us and, personally, a very’
satisfying coaching victory. The
principles that we work so hard on

. _in practice made the difference."

In addition to Kratz’s fine perfor-
mance, several other Panthers con-
tributed. Senior Chris Femiani
won the side horse with a score of

’ 9. lpfreshman Mark Klafter tied for

first (8.65) in the rings and junior

Dave Smith captured second place ,
in the floor exercise (9.5) andain the f '
vault (9.45). D’Amico was very ‘

pleased with the overall perfor-
mance and believes that his team is
only a step away from the Top 20.

“We still have a wayito go, ‘but 

we are putting things together,”
D’Amico said. “We need a couple
of 270-point performances before
we will be ranked. We have beaten
two good teams over the last two
weeks in I1linoi.s«(ranked 16th) and

N .C. State (ranked 2 1 st), and we are .

developing some’ confidence.” ‘

Explorers Searchout Win Over Panthers

As the Panther swim team

«digs into the meat of its

schedule, they are finding that

‘the going is getting tougher.

Two weekends ‘ago,
Panthers narrowly edged Penn
State 63-50. Then on Saturday,

, LaSalle, a team considered a
 notch~ better than Penn State,
visited Trees pool and escaped ‘

with a 59-54 victory over Pitt.
For Coach Fred Lewis, his
first loss of the season should

‘ not have come at the hands of

the Explorers.

“We improved in almost
every event,” he said. “This
was a meet we shouldn’t have
lost.”‘ - I

A consoling factor for-Pitt
was the performances of juniors
Ed Bahan and J .D. McCrillis,
both of whom did
extraordinarily well, according

to Lewis. Bahan anchored the

final event, the 400-yard
freestyle relay, and completed a

_39.9l split time for Pitt, scoring

seven points that made the final
score closer.

Mc_Crillis was the distance
person for Lewis and prodﬁced
accordingly in the 100- and 200-

the

yard freestyle and the 400-yard
freestyle relays. McCrillis
played a big part, scoring 16 of
the Panthers’ total points.

Other Panthers finishing well
on the day were divers Mark
McCormick and John Dusch.
McCormick placed first off the
one-meter board, scoring 291.2
points. He also placed second in
the three-meter event with 163.2
points.

Dusch tied MCormick off the
same three-meter board.
However, the freshman did not

fare as well as in the one-meter -

event as he placed fifth with a
total of 219 points.

During the entire afternoon,
Lewis had to deal with constant
mental and physical" malfunc-
tions.

“We basically did not
perform up to our abilities,”

_ Lewis explained. “There were a
lot of breakdowns that added

. ,' up. Afterwards, everyone was

pretty demoralized. But, we

At least not negatively. Lewis
and his squad are preparing for
a meet against West Virginia.
The meet will be even tgggier

Gymnasts Fall In Tri- Meet 

By SARA STRICKLAND

Despite a gallant effort, the Lady
Panther gymnastics team finished
at the bottom ofa tri-meetcompeti-
tion last Friday night. The Lady
Panthers, with a team score of 161,
were out-scored by Michigan State
by nine-tenths of a point and by

‘ winner West Virginia University,
which scored a total of 167.55.

The Lady Panthers lacked depth
in their roster this’ week due to the
loss of freshman gymnasts Kristy
Pieters and _lackie‘Calderone. Piet-
ers is out with a knee injury, and
Calderone is battling a case of
tonsillitis. .

The highlight for the Lady
Panthers was the performance of
junior Karen Martin. Martin
‘placed third in the all-around with

guess that’s out of reach now,
but we're still aiming to win the

‘Big East and go on to the

NCAA s.”

Lewis believes many «of his
athletes are not yet up to par.
He is expecting better
performances from all of his
swimmers as, they start
concentrating on their
individual events, now that

ginia. Martin also took first place

' A near-flawless routine by senior
‘Babbie Flock on the balance beam
earned her a score of 8.6. She also
compiled a fine all-around score of
33.5.

Debb.ie Dabkowski showed
marked improvement this week on
the vault and unevens, scoring a
respectable 8.4 on each.

Senior captain Gretchen Speich
upped the _Lady Panthers team
total on the vault by scoring 8.45.

Although the team score
dropped seven points from last
week’s 167, Sanft believes the Lady
Panthers have improved.

passing thought.

“Everyone is_ getting polished  '

up now,” Lewis added. “It’s
just a matter of everyone’s
getting faster,” '

Referring to West Virginia as
being “better overall” than
Pitt, Lewis had better hope he
gets a sterling performance
from his team if he expects to
come out on top.

“For the third week in a row, we
have shown improvement," Sanft
said. ‘

To replace Pieters and Calde-
rone, Sanft sought out the talents
of freshman Stacy Constien and"
Diane Mauder along with junior
Eve Singer to aid the Panther
roster. .

“In order to improve our team
score, we must eliminate falls and
breaks in our routines," Sanft said.
“Our goals next week- are a clean
and perfect meet. If we hit, our
team score should improve. Also,

the addition of Pieters or Calde-,

rone in any event would also help

A16-3 decision by heavyweight
Dan Kasperkoski over Ray Porter

- gave the Panther wrestling team a

4-!“

 

24-21 come-from-behind win over
Ashland Saturday at the Fitzgerald
Field House. Pitt was forced _to
come from 9-0 and 21-15 deficits to
ea-rn the win.

Neither Kasperkoski nor Porter
could score in the first period, but
the Ashland‘ heavyweight took a 2-
0 lead on a reversal, in the second
period. Kasperkoski then scored
two escapes and two takedowns to
earn the final margin and the Pan-
ther victory. .

“We’ve got to look at not giving
up points in specific situations_,”
assistant coach Chuck Coryea said.
“It’s mental as opposed to physical
conditioning. We gave up two pins
and still won. We can do that
against Ashland and pull out a
win, but if we wrestle a tougher’

"team that doesn't ‘give up pins,

then we're hurting."

Swimmers Peach Low Point After LossTo Clarion

'Wendy Morgan. The freshman set

By SCOTT DELLETT

‘Not very long ago, the Lady
Panther swim team was considered
the best in the East. Then Prince-
ton took over the title, but Pitt
remained a close second.

Saturday, the Lady Panthers
may have reached their lowest
point of the 1982-83 dual meet sea-

' son as they lost to Clarion, a Div-

sion II swimming power, 90.5-58.5.
The I defeat marked the fifth
straightloss for "Pitt, who is still
looking for its first win of the
season. .
' “We didn't swim well," coach
David Belowich said. “We were
very inconsistent."

“I’m not displeased with the
effort o_f the team, but some times
haven't improved. The mental atti-

The Pitt News, Monday, ]anuary.24, I983 ’ I

tude may have something to do
with it." -

Even one of the Lady Panthers
top swimmers had a bit of a lapse.
Sue Heon qualified for NCAA
Nationals by winning the 1000-
yard freestyle with a time of
10:06.58. After placing second in
the next event—the 200-yard back-
stroke, I-Ieon recovered to take first
in the 500-yard freestyle with a sea-
sonal best time of 4:59.70.

“That one mental lapse cost Sue
first place,” Belowich said. _

Jan Ujevich continued her
unbeaten streak as she took first
place in the 100 and 200-yard free-
style and the 200-yard individual
medley. “I was pleased with _]an’s
nerformance," Belowich said.

Another performance that Belo-
wich was happy with was that of

a seasonal best in the 100-yard
backstroke, finishing second with a
time of l:l0.45. Morgan also set a
personal best time in the 200-yard
breast stroke (2:36.74) even though
she finished third. '

Diana Firth took a first in the
l00-yard breast stroke with a time
of 1:10.33 and a second in the 200-
yard breast stroke (2:30.59).

It's not these-performances that
disappoint Belowich, it is the "lack
of consistency of the others on the
team. Alicia Du Gan swam the 50-
and the I00-yard freestyle faster in
the Penn State meet.

Even though the difference was
in fractions of seconds—which
amounts to about a half of a
bodylength—Belowich was still
critical.

“I’m a perfectionist, and lwould
like to see improvement in every
meet," he said.

Even the divers showed inconsis-
tency. Sophomore Yvonne Johns-
ton took first place in the one-
meter diving with a score of 248.85.
In the three-meter diving event,
Johnston finished third, behind
two Clarion divers. A

“Some swimmers are on the
right track. They’re at the point I

like them to be at this point of the ,

season," Belowich said. “The rest
aren't, and I'm not pleased with
them.” .

“Some have improved their per-
formances five times over,” Belo-
wich said. “Now we need everyone
to do just that.”

Part of the problem the team is

having is due to concentration,

Whidh in turn. is’ due to the
number of inexperienced
swimmers.

:‘We need good concentration
skills to do well," Belowich said.
“lt’s justla matter of developing
these skills and allowing the
freshman-oriented team to
mature.” .

Belowich compared the Clarion
meet to last year's Tennessee meet,
which the Lady Panthers lost.

“Against Tennessee, the inten-

.«(‘;' ;,

sity level wasn't there,” Belowich.’ ’
said. After the meet came East- "-

erns, and we did very well.”

“We swam well at Penn State,
but we didn't ‘have a thing at Clar-
ion. We are a better team than what

we have shown. I have no doubt _

that we can swim fast. It's very frus-
trating," Belowich said.
