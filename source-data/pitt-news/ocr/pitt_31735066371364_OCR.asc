Comedian Steven Wright, a
man who once went to a drive-in
movie in a cab, performed before
a sold—out crowd at the William
Pitt Union Monday night.

In mesmerizing monotone,
Wright shared his many child-
hood memories with the
audience.

“I remember the first time I
went to sleep“ My mother said,
‘go to sleep.‘ I said ‘Where's that?‘

“As a baby I kept a diary. Day
one, still tired from the move.“

“I had a quicksand box in my

back yard. I was an only child --
eventually."

Wright also discussed the
highlights of his adolescent
years.

“The first time I read the dic-
tionary, I thought it was a poem
about everything," he said.

“I was in love with my oral
hygienist," he told the crowd.
“Before l had my teeth cleaned,l
would eat an entire box of Oreo
Cookies. Sometimes they would
have to cancel the rest of the
day’s appointments.”

Wright delivered these one
joke after another, barely giving
the audience time to stop laugh-
ing. Wright also discussed his
insights and problems as a con-

University groups
to lobby Congress  

By Michael Fay
The Pitt News

About 40 faculty members and
students from Pitt and four other
Pittsburgh schools left for Washing-
ton, D.C., this morning to join an
estimated 600 to 1,000 people from
other universities in a one-day lob-
bying effort designed to bring their
concerns over the nuclear arms race
to the attention of Congress.

‘‘I’m fairly pleased [with the tur-
nout],” said Pitt physicist John
Townsend, the trip organizer for
Pittsburgh, though he admitted he
was “a little disappointed with [the
lack of] faculty participation."

Rev. Bob White, a campus minis-
ter at both Pitt and Carlow and a
veteran participant in the anti-
nuclear movement, attributed the
lack of participation more to a feel-
ing ofpowerlessness among students
and the abstract nature of the issue
than to apathy.

“There‘s not as much apathy
[among students] as people think.
We're not in the middle ofa nuclear
war, and the defense industry is
behind closed doors," White said,
adding that the arms race lacks the
immediacy of Vietnam.

Another area school, Indiana
University of Pennsylvania (IUP),
has responded very strongly to the

trip, according to Townsend. The
group from IUP, which originally
planned to leave from Pittsburgh,
grew large enough to provide its-own
transportation.

Once the Pittsburgh group
reaches Washington, it will join
groups from other eastern universi-
ties located in about 70 congres-
sional districts at an hour-long
training session led by Rep. Ed Mar-
key, co-sponsor of a nuclear freeze
resolution in the House of Represen-
tatives.

The remainder of the day will be
spent by the various groups in meet-
ings with senators and representa-
tives from their respective
congressional districts. They will
also attend workshops that they
hope will help them be more effec-
tive on the local level.

The specific goals ofthe lobbying,
according to United Campuses to
Prevent Nuclear War (UCAM), the
sponsoring organization, are:

0To inform Congress of concern
about the arms race and opposition
to government policies regarding it.

0To let Congress know the effect
this issue will have in upcoming
elections.

GT0 generate publicity and
momentum for arms control efforts.

0To train university activists to
register voters and lobby local
representatives.

Genetic engineering:
who should play God?

By Jill Devine and

Jill Colamarlno
The Pitt News

A doctor and a social theorist
debated the advantages and disad-
vantages of genetic engineering
Monday with one participantcalling
such experiments “playing with
fire.”

Geneticist Dr. Zsolt Harsanyi and
social theorist Jeremy Rifkin dis-
cussed the risks and benefits
involved with genetic engineering in
the David Lawrence Auditorium
Monday night in a panel debate
entitled, “Genetic Engineering: Who
Should Play God."

Harsanyi said there are benefits to
genetic engineering and advocated
two techniques in particular: muta-
tion and recombinant DNA technol-
ogy. Mutation causes a chemical
change to take place within the gene
itself, while the recombinant DNA
method transfers certain segments
of the gene from one DNA strand to
another.

Harsanyi pointed out the past suc-
cesses of genetic engineering in
creating surpluses in crops such as

Details...page 17

com, tomatoes, and grain.

Genetic engineering, he said, was
responsible for the widespread avail-
ability of penicillin, which he claims
could have saved the lives of 20 mil-
lion people from the influenza epi-
demic in l9l8, if the present
technique had been known. It also
led to the discovery of the vaccines
for smallpox, polio, and diptheria.

The real issue, however, was
whether genetic engineering could
successfully be applied to human
beings.

Harsanyi said he favors replacing
“faulty" genes with “healthy" ones, a
technique that may be in use within
five years. He added that the “bub-
ble boy,” David, who diedjust weeks
ago, might have survived ifthis tech-
nique had been perfected with
regard to bone marrow.

Rifkin, however, said, “You can-
not talk genetic engineering unless
you're willing to discuss eugenics."

“Eugenics," he explained, “is the
philosophy of using gene manipula-
tion to create a better organism, ora
better race.“ The “whole art" of
genetic engineering is deciding what
are good or bad genes, he said.

Rifkin asked who should be

He has only entertained a few
of the colleges around the nation
such as Florida State and ()hio
State.

“College crowds are a little
more into it, but not that differ-
ent beeause most comedy shops
draw college students," he
explained.

The 28-year-old comedian
said he was influenced by many
great comedians such as Bill
Cosby. “I remember in elemen-
tary school he was the biggest
thing.”

George Carlin was another
comedian who. influenced
Wright, but not by his use ofpro—
fanity. “I thought it would be
more creative to not use them,”
Wright said. “It's easier to get a
laugh using them. Plus you can't
do it on television. I don‘t know;
Ijust figured I wouldn'tdothat,"
Wright said.

Although these comedians
inﬂuenced him into comedy,
nothing really inspired him into
using the “one-liner" joke. “It
just happened like that. That‘s
the way I wrote thejoke," Wright
said.

Carter reflects on '84 campaign

Former president Jimmy Carter said that the Democrats had
better get their act together, or they’ll face four more years of
President Reagan. Carter reﬂected on the T984 election cam-
paign yesterday. He said the Democrats must unite on issues
rather than campaign on personal charisma because Reagan’s
policies are not as popular as Reagan’s personality. Carter
gives the Democrats a good chance at beating Reagan,‘ pro-
vided they unite on the issues.

Anti-nuclear missile appeal shot

A Canadian judge rejected a last—minute appeal yesterday‘

missiles began over the Arctic wilderness. An American B-52
bomber was in the air, carrying four unarmed cruise missiles,
when the ruling was handed down in Ottawa. The demonstra-
tors said they will form a human barricade at the Canadian Air
Force Base near Edmonton, where the test is to end.

Teacher strikes reviewed

HAR RISBU RG -— Lawmakers will begin to review the right

told a special Senate committee yesterday that the strikers
create chaos and interfere with education. Among the propos-

can strike, prohibiting selective strikes and penalizing unions
that defy court orders. -

Administrators explain DEC
agreement to Senate Council "

By Diane Lefkowltz
The Pitt News

The recently announced agree-
ment between Pitt and Digital
Equipment Corp. (DEC) that will
allow the university to purchase up
to $8 million in computer hardware
was explained at Monday’s Senate
Council meeting.

“We are continuing to expand on
our ‘campus of the future’ program
with the network we built with
AT&T," said Pitt Chancellor Wes-
ley Posvar.

The terms of the agreement, the
third and largest between Pitt and
DEC, call for the university to do
computer software research in two
areas: computer-based education, in
which instructors can program a
computer to virtually teach a course
in any subject, and computer main-
tenance and monitoring.

“Computer companies are very
anxious to observe big computer
networks in actual operation to find
ways to improve the operation of

ch big networks," said Associate

Senior Vice-Chancellor for Admin-

istration David Forejt.

“Its an agreement that specifies
very attractive prices for the univer-
sity for all of Digital's equipment,"
he said.

Pitt will spend $4 million for hard-
ware, worth an estimated $8 million,
according to Jinx Walton, manager
of staff and user communications in
the University Computer Center.

Pitt has agreed to buy from DEC's
VAX equipment line, which
includes personal and so-called
super mini-computers. There are
already eight VAX systems serving
specific university departments,
including the Learning Research
and Development Center.

“VAX computers will be part of
the‘campus of the future,’ " Forejt
said. “They will be computing
resources that will be located in var-
ious places around the Oakland
campus as well as around the
regional campuses.“

The university is also looking at
DEC‘s Rainbow l00+, PRO 325 and
PRO 350 lines.

World.

.. “lt’s hard to say how many we're
going to buy because we haven’t
decided which ones we're going to
buy," Forejt said.

As part of the “campus of the
future,” Pitt recently purchased a
National Advanced Systems com-
puter, either an 8040 or 8050 Central
Processing Unit, that will be the
computing engine for the new admi-
nistrative computing systems. The
replacement system will cost
between one and two million dollars
when peripherals (such as disks,
tapes and line printers) are included.

The cost of these computers is not
part of the $20 million spent on the
AT&T transport system, according
to Ray Steele, assistant to the
provost.

“We’re trying our very best not to
waste money on this deal," Steele
said.

He said a needs assessment survey
is being conducted among faculty
and staff — and, eventually, stu-
dents — to determine who gets the
new computers. Other concerns
include which computers to buy,
and what software to purchase for
those computers.

Meese
A Mistake  

This week, President Reagan’s chief adviser, Edwin'Meese,
has been appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee for
hearings about his possible confirmation as attorney general.
The notion of Meese as attorney general, however, is the very
antithesis of justice. .

lf confirmed, as it appears he will be, Attorney General
Meese will serve notice that the Reagan administration has
turned its back on this country’s poor and needy in favor ofthe
wealthy and well-connected.

Meese has used the influence of his presen* position to return
favors to his wealthy California friends, who saved him from
becoming a member of the impoverished. a group he so vehe-
mently derides in public.

Meese was 34 payments behind on more than $450,000 of

‘ outstanding loans when his banker extended his loan and even

lent him an additional $2l,000. Then, Meese‘s friendly banker
suddenly became a member of the U.S. United Nations delega-
tion. Another official of the same bank has been appointed
head‘of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.

Meese insists that his dealing is “absolutely a business deal.”
Senator Howard Metzenbaum, a member of the Senate Judi-
ciary Committee, suggests that Meese's record is too suspicious
to'entrust him to such a vitally sensitive position as counsel to
the president, the highest legal position in the country.

More questions concerning Meese‘s appointment of friends
to sinecures surfaced this week. Certain to be discussed this
week are dealings with Meese’s tax accountant, John McKeen,
who was able to get Meese a series of loans for $60,000. After
the loans were made, McKean was named to the United States
Postal Service Board of Governors.

It is hard fo understand how someone with as many financial
problems and obligations as Meese can display such disconcern
for the poor. He is opposed to social programs such as free food
distribution, claiming that the poor use them “just because
they’re free.“’He has also opposed free legal service for the
poor

Meese denies any prior knowledge of his friends federal
appointments. However, his actions in acquiring close to $l
million in personal loans have been completely lacking in the
good judgment and ethics that are necessary to hold the office
of attorney general.

‘ Letters to the Editor

A reply to the
persecuted
Greeks

As evidenced by the three letters
to the editor in the March 5 issue, the
periodic paranoid whining of the
“persecuted“ Greeks has returned
again.

It has always amused me to see the
reactions of the brothers and sisters
whenever something “derogatory" is
said about them. The Kleenex has
been pulled from the shelves again.
If they spent as much time doing
their charity work asthey did crying,
arthritis, retardation and poverty
would be wiped from the face of the
earth, and they could then concen-
trate on brotherhood. friendship
and having a swell time.

A most entertaining letter was
Mr. Fox's. He felt insulted and
inspired enough to give us a list of
distinguished Greeks. According to
Mr. Fox,there have been I6 Con-
gressmen, five governors, three
judges and one president who have
been Greek.

Considering the thousands of

Congressmen and governors in our
nation's history, those 2| Greeks
add up to a staggering percentage.
There has also been a Greek presi-
dent, Mr. Fox boasts. William
Mckinley, certainly one of the more
illustrious presidents, was a model
Greek. Allegheny College (McKin-
ley's alma mater) students are fond
of telling the story of how Brother
McKinley was expelled for placing a
cow on the roof of one of the aca-
demic halls. I'll bet none ofthe other
39 non—Greek presidents can boast

From where I stand/ Chris Bosso

of a feat of that magnitude.

Allow me to add to,the impressive
list of Greek dignitaries. John
Ehrlichman and H.R. Haldeman,
two men who also helped shaped
American history, were also part of
the Greek system. I wonder what
percentage of the Watergate con-
spirators thegv make up‘? Using Fox's
analogy, isn't it safe to say. then. that

being Greek means that the chances ~

of going to jail or being a high-
ranking government official (or
both) are roughly equal’?

In closing, while seeking profes-
sional help at Western Psych at the
suggestion of Mr. Fox, ldiscovered
a sizable ward devoted to the treat-
ment of acute paranoia. I would
advise you and your brothers and
sisters to drop in for a quick
checkup. However, beware of cows
on the roof.

to me the statement that “Career

that career development is a promi-
nent issue in the minds of students
who come to the Counseling Center
for career planning help.

In the course of a college educa-
tion, students ideally learn to think
clearly, reason imaginatively.

Hart pounding strong, but

mo-men-tum (mo-men‘-tem) I.
the impetus of a moving object. 2.

_ strength or force that keeps growing

(a campaign that gained

momentum).

Washington Post writer David
Broder spotted the first momentum
of spring the day after Gary Hart
won the Maine Democratic presi-
dential caucus. Hart, Broder crowed
from below the masthead, has dealt
Walter Mondale “a serious and pos-
sibly fatal blow." The fact that less
than l8,000 of Maine's people voted
didn’t seem to matter.

Suddenly Hart is everywhere.
Time, Newsweek and U. S. News and
World Report all feature Hart’s
boyish face-on the front cover. “Now
he is a front-runner in the race for
the Democratic presidential nomi-

nation," USA Today breathlessly
reports, and the morning television
news shows all clamor for Hart's
presence in between the reports on
fashion and the weather. Hart is now
the political equivalent of Michael
Jackson. Hart is everywhere. Hartis
. hot.

What is going on here? Three
weeks ago, the assorted media
savants doubted whether anything
short of a plane crash could stop the
Mondale juggernaut. Columnist
George Will stuck his finger in the
air, feltonly a matter of ‘time, the
pundits agreed, before Mondale fin-
ished the prelims and got on to the
serious business of beating the Great
Communicator in the White House.

But now, momentum. George
Bush once called it “Big Mo"after he
temporarily led Reagan in 1980,
though in Bush’s case, Big Mo

quickly became Little Mo and Gary '

Hart clearly has Big Mo.

He is now compared to John
Kennedy as he pounds home his
theme of “new ideas“ and as he
derides Walter “Little Humphrey"
Mondale and Mondale’s AFL-ClO
supporters as the epitome of “old
politics.“ The implication is that old
is bad, new is good, and Hart now
represents that always strong anti-
establishment strain residing in his
party.

In truth, Hart is hard to distin-
guish on most issues from either
Mondale or McGovern, but his call
for a “fresh start“ obviously sets all
liberal hearts aflutter. ln primaries,
George Will notes, “Democrats do
the damnedest things," and usually

surprise the hell out of all of us.

Voters in those “crucial" states of
New Hampshire and Maine (i.e.,“as

the race is young

Maine goes, so goes the nation") did
just that, and who knows what the
good people in Wyoming will do
next. The fact that these states, com-
bined, account for but a few of the
3,000 Democratic presidential dele-
gates doesn't seem to matter. it ain't
numbers; it's momentum.

So now Gary Hart has momen-
tum. Walter Mondale never really
had it — his campaign always had
more of an air of the “inevitable"
than anything else — and John
Glenn's momentum petered out
about the time that “The Right
Stuff“ pulled the same act. Glenn's
momentum now resembles molasses
in wintertime; so slow that it looks
motionless. .

But beware, Mr. Hart. Momen-
tum, like Truth or Beauty, is both
fleeting and in the eye of the
beholder. Big Mo bumped into Hart

' cause

shortly after his smashing l6 percent
second-place showing (i.e., “vic-
tory") in Iowa and latched onto th '
candidate not unlike the American
electorate, and failure to match
future _“expectations" will probably
Big Mo to reconsider his
choice. And with Big Mo comes Big
Scrutiny. The Dark Horse is now a
front-runner, and the rave: of the
media will now treat Hart 2 “presi-
dential"; that is, they will d. where
no one has dug before. Just \\ ‘riat are
those “new ideas," anyway?

SGB president adapts smoothly to new post

By John Gambescia
The Pitt News

After two months as Student
Government Board president, the
personality and actions of Ken
Stram have met with a wide range of
criticism and praise, an indication
that the eye of the public has been
scrutinizing him.

Recently, the irreverent hand of
Pitt News cartoonist Mark Schneid-
millerjokingly portrayed Stram as a
world-renowned and lovable figure
~ Mickey Mouse.

The cartoon suggested a depiction
of Stram that he himself has con-
ceded to be exaggerated but not
totally off-base.

His associates, however, present a
different appraisal.

“He is probably one of the nicest
people that anyone could meet,”
said Kathy Brown, a past SGB
member and personal friend of
Stram. “He has been more than a
friend to me, and this friendliness
clearly shows through in his daily
relationships throughout the univer-
sity community.“

Stram reacted to the cartoon with
laughter, according to SGB adviser
Joyce Giangarlo.

“If he hadn't laughed, then I don't
think I would have laughed," Gian-
garlo said.

“I was concerned for him because
I didn’t want him to think that he
was being [targeted] before he had a
chance to prove who he was," she
said. “He appeared like it didn‘t even
faze him, and it even happened that
when he left a message for me that

same day, he signed it ‘Mickey
Mouse.‘ ”

Stram, a 20-year-old junior and
an active member of Theta Chi fra-
ternity, was born and raised in York,
Pa., and graduated from West York
High School in l98l. He entered Pitt
as a physical therapy student but has
since changed his major to political

‘ science.

As a sophomore, Stram was
elected to the board and concen-
trated his efforts toward assigning
and monitoring Student Senate
Committee positions.

“I wanted to get active in student
activities, so I figured that the best
way to do that would be to involve
myself in SGB,” Stram said.

Stram was fascinated by his work
and chose to run for SGB president.
When election time approached, he
decided against appointing a cam-
paign manager, confident he could
run the campaign more efficiently by
himself.

“It was interesting to see the type
of strategy Ken took during his cam-
paign,” Giangarlo said. “Instead of
going in there and throwing around
a lot of harsh words, Ken decided to
step away from that and present
himself for who he was and what he
had done and hope his strategy
would carry him, and I think it really
worked for him.“

It did.

Stram won the November election
by 77 votes and assumed the office of
president in January.

One of his goals is to bridge the
communication gap between board
members, according to Giangarlo.
She said Stram often felt unin-
formed about many things that were

Ken Stram
happening when he was on the
board.

“He now uses his past experience
as a watchful eye for this year and
goes out of his way to make sure his
board members are aware of every-
thing that is going on,” Giangarlo
said.

"His prior board experience is
what makes him a better president;
he has the history of a board
member, he has had one year's
worth of what happens administra-
tively, and he can use all ofthis to his
advantage."

Betsy Fitzpatrick, a current board
member, describes the relationship
Stram has with his board by saying,
“He has a very laid-back and relaxed
attitude with us, and I think his past
board experience has helped him
uncover and deal with problems

‘His prior board expe-
rience is what makes
him a better president;
he has the history of a
board member, he has
one years worth of
what happens adminis-
tratively, and he can
use all of this to his
advantage.’

--Joyce Giangarlo

which others might not have been
able to solve as effectively.

“He displays a leadership-type
role but, at the same time, is not
domineering at all. The board
members relate well to him,“ Fitz-
patrick said.

“We have planning sessions every
week, and he is constantly informing
us on what is going on through
memos and personal contact," she
said.

Stram recently attended a confer-
ence at Texas A&M entitled‘ “Con-
ference on Student Government
Associations.“ He said the confer-
ence was very informative but did
have its drawbacks.

“I brought back some really good
ideas that I want to try to incorpo-
rate into our SGB, but overall, I
think the conference was far too gen-

eral in the ideas presented," Stram
said.

“It was very reassuring to know
other student presidents of large stu-
dent bodies have the same problem
of motivating many students with
contrasting views,” he said.

The allocations process has been
one of the main concerns of the SGB
over the past few weeks.

Giangarlo said Stram’s instinctive
approach to the financial requests of
various student groups is “gener-
ous," and he seems to be “very sym-
pathetic" to their needs. A

“I keep telling Ken that we are ina
financial concern this year and that
he must watch how much he
approves because we only have a
certain amount of money, and once
we go over that amount, there is
none left," Giangarlo said.

Giangarlo said that Stram’s con-
tinual argument is that the program
is good or the group is good. How-
ever, she said, Stram is beginning to
address the issue of what future pres-
idents will do when the demands for
money become much higher in the
future.

One long-standing criticism of
SGB is that it fails to involve the
entire student body; often the views
of the board members do not actu-
ally reflect the views of the students.

“Getting the students involved
and informing them on what is hap-
pening seems to be what Ken is the
most concerned about,“ Brown said.

“He really cares about the univer-
sity community and has a genuine
concern about the views ofall -— not
just the board," she said. “I think
that this feeling has spread through
the board and to many of the other
student groups."

Pitt senior Eric Klopfer, who last
month won a prestigious Marshall
Scholarship as one of the nation’s
top 30 undergraduate history stu-
dents, was presented Monday with a
separate $l,000 scholarship from

. Mrs. George Zubasic ofthe Fort Pitt

Society of the Daughters of the
American Revolution.

Starting this year, the Fort Pitt
Chapter of the DAR plans to pres-
ent an annual award of $1,000 to the
most outstanding undergraduate
studying American history at Pitt.
Klopfer is the first winner.

Next month, as part ofan unusual
five-year program, Klopfer will
receive his B.A. and his M.A. in his-
tory and expects to graduate with a
3.96 grade point average. Klopfer
said the Marshall Scholarship will
enable him to study at Oxford Uni-
versity in England for two years,
with all expenses paid.

Professor Peter Karsten of Pitt's
history department said he believes
Klopfer‘s acheivements reflect very
well on the school.

“People never realize that we have
one of the best undergraduate
schools in the area available here at
Pitt."

According to Karsten, not only is
Pitt's history department among the
top third in the nation, but its chem-
istry, anthropology and psychology
departments rank even higher, and
its philosophy department is No. 2 in
the country, second only to that of
Princeton.

Klopfer said that Pitt has one of
the best history departments

“because the professors really push
and challenge you."

He said the history department
could improve itself by letting more
people know how good it really is.

Klopfer was selected for the DAR
award by his professors and said he
didn't even know about the competi-
tion until one of them told him he
had won.

television program on Monday
night.

Professor Josephine O'Brien
Schaeffer and local artist Jane
Haskell were guests on WQED-
TV‘s “Lyceum.“ Schaeffer
explored the implications of
Orwell‘s fictional totalitarian
state, where, in her words, “every
flick of your eyelash would be
recorded.“

She said readers often have
“the notion that ‘l984‘[depicts]a
totalitarian state modeled on the
Soviet Union." This is not so, she
said. explaining that the ideas in
the book derive “not from a far
left view but very much from a
far right view."

“The abuse of language is so
important in the book,"
Schaeffer noted. Orwell de-
scribes a world in which “lan-
guage is no longer a vehicle for
individual thought but has
become a thoughtless, brainless.

explained.

The station chose‘“l984" as

Seminary in East Liberty.

and workshops intended to give
both children and adults an
opportunity to discuss issues

Special Pullout Section The Pitt News, Wednesday March 7, I984 Page 13

TAKING

By Joe Zeff
The Pitt News

It’s that time ofyear in Big East basketball circles — time
to go (iardening.

The Big East Basketball Championship returns to the
Mecca of indoor sports. Madison Square Garden. tonight
for the second conseeutiye year.

“The epitome of college basketball." Panther head coach
Roy Chipman said. “No comparison to anywhere else. A
great thrill for coaches. players and fans. The atmosphere is
very exciting. and all the media attention adds to the
glamour."

Some l9.59l seats will be filled when the tournament gets
underway at 8 p.m.. when Providence (I4-I3) and Seton
Hall (8-I 9) square off. Sportswriters from all over the nation
have descended upon Manhattan to watch the big boys of
the Big East clash.

Most eyes will be directed toward (leorgetown. the clear
favorite to be wearing the Big East crown after the cham-
pionship game Saturday night. lts 26-3 record. No. 2 rank-
ing in both basketba‘-Bi-ptills and 7-0 center Fatrick Ewing
have intimidated both critics and opponents alike.

"Going into the tournament. it‘s a wide-open battle —
with the exception of (ieorgetown." said Mike Tranghese.
associate commissioner of the Big East Conference. "Other
than them. anybody can beat anyone."

The Panthers (I6-ll) are well aware of (£eorgetown’s
merits. having learned firsthand during the regular season.
The Hoyas dropped Pitt 63-52 at Fitzgerald Field House and
then rubbed it in at the Capital Centre last Wednesday 7|-52.

Pitt senior guard Billy Culbertson stresses that the past is
just that - history. ;.

‘NOTES: Wlanova started the season with a 3-7 record, showing
problems caused by the loss of John Pinone and Stewart Granger to
graduation. The Wildcats recovered with the strong play of Pressley at
forward and Dobbs at guard. -

Since losing to Georgetown on Feb. 15, Villanova has won ﬁve in a

row, including a 73-72 win over St. John's at the Palestra last Saturday.

NOTES: Boston College suffered the dishonor of losing to Seton
Hall last week but recovered Saturday to rout Connecticut 83-60 last
Saturday to tie St. John's for fourth place in the conference. Clark was
reinstated on the roster after receiving a onegame suspension. The
senior forward got into a yelling match with head coach Gary Williams
against Syracuse Feb. 22.

Primus’ insertion into the Eagles‘ lineup has given the team more
offensive punch. A better shooter than Pressley, Primus has averaged
10.6 ppg in the last six contests.

NOTES: Providence was perhaps the most disappointing team in
the second half of conference play. At one point, they were 46 in the
Big East, but the Friars lost ﬁve of their last six games. Two losses to
Connecticut have given Providence the eighth seed in the conference,
which means they play Seton Hall tonight in the preliminary round. The
winner gets the right to face Georgetown.

‘ Notes: The Orangemen have been struggling in the last six games.
Although they are 4-2 during this period, three games have gone into
overtime, and last week the Orangemeh only defeated Canisus by four
and lost to Georgetown by 17.

Despite losing three starters from last season. Syracuse has not
missed a beat, due to balanced scoring, the improvement of Hawkins
at the post and the presence of Washington at point guard.

Panthers take aim

(continued from cover)

“Everybody’s record is 0-0
starting now, and whoever can
get three wins..." Culbertson
said, jumping beyond Villanova
(l7-I0). the Panthers’ opponent
tomorrow at 3 p.m.

The cross-state rivals split the
season series this year. Senior»

Clyde Vaughan sprained his‘

ankle in the first game, which
Pitt lost by 13 points. The Panth-

vers returned the favor at Fitzge-

rald. when 6-l0 Wildcat center
Ed Pinckney goaltended George
Allen’s last-second shot for a 47-
45 Pitt win.

“I think we match up pretty
well." Chipman assessed. “The
last time we played. Clyde had a
very bad game. and we still beat
them.

The Panthers. having lost their
last four games, were tossed in a
Cuisinart at last season’s tourna-

'ment. Few fans attended the

quarterfinal game. in which St.
John‘s Billy Goodwin almost
single-handedly eliminated Pitt
64-53. .  ‘“

“Last year we had run the
gauntlet." Chipman said. “We
were down. and we were strug-
gling. lt was pretty hard to find
anything positive about that
team. but now we have a lot of
positive things to look at.”

Vaughan represents one of
those positive things. Just three
points shy of Larry Harris'carcer
scoring record of 1.914 points.
Vaughan’s success in this tourna-
ment could have a bearing on a
possible berth in the National
Invitational Tournament.

The Pitt News, Wednesday, March 7, 1984

. Television means big bucks in Big East

By Todd Erkel
The Pitt News

Televised college basketball —
once the orphan of marketable
sports entertainment -- has grown
and multiplied so quickly that some
observers are calling for a reduction
in exposure before someone gets
financially burnt.

Talk of television contract rene-
gotiation has swept through college
basketball, suggesting that the less
stable of draws may find themselves
sans a few dollars come next season.’

The Big East Conference boasts
one of the largest television pack-
ages, both in terms of total dollars
and coverage. of any conference in
the nation. The three-year package,
which includes a syndication deal
along with network and cable
appearances, has been estimated to
be worth $6 million, falling short of
only the Atlantic Coast Conference.

Big East associate commissioner
Mike Tranghese last week assured
members of the press that Pitt and
the other eight member schools
stand on solid television ground.

“From a financial point of view, it
has been excellent," Tranghese said.
“The contracts have been everything
we have hoped for."

The Big East currently has con-
tracts with Metrosports, the largest

-I.s.\\ KZW
WM

-~~nIo
TIE

Ell
M”

sports television syndicator in the
nation, and two of the major net-
works, NBC and CBS.

Tranghese said that Metrosports
pays the conference in five install-
ments, three of which have been met
already, with the fourth due shortly
and the last to be calculated after
this week's post-season tournament.

“We don't anticipate any prob-
lems,“ Tranghese said.

At Pitt, where basketball income
has never approached that of foot-
ball, officials are dancing around
actual figures, but estimate its televi-

?

lllllllll

sion income from the first year ofthe
Big East package at $750,000. Two
seasons ago, in the arid world of the
Eastern Eight, Pitt could squeeze
only $4000 out of television
contracts.

All but two of Pitt’s conference
games this season have been tele-
vised. Big East teams appear on reg-

ular Monday night and Saturday -

afternoon syndicated broadcasts. as
well as on four nationally televised
games on cable.

“Did we forecast that the televi-
sion contracts would be as good as

they were?" asked Pitt‘s athletic
director Dr. Ed Bozik. “We knew
that there would be new contracts,
but we had no idea what the magni-
tudes would be.”

In addition to the financial
bonanza, the television contracts
assure Big East teams a minimum of
20 national network appearances
each year. Exposure of that kind
extends the recruiting bounds of Big
East coaches. Television exposure
can sway a great high school player
to a school. Witness Pitt's signing of
Curtis Aiken last year.

“With the television coverage, you
can go into Buffalo and say to a
Curtis Aiken, ‘Watch us tomorrow,
we’ll be on the USA Network,"‘said
Pitt basketball sports information
director Kimball Smith.

“A kid can go to a school 200 or
300 miles away and his parents can
still see him on television,” said Bos-
ton College head coach Gary
Williams.

The exposure has also brought
attention to other Big East players.
Smith said that he receives at least
one call per week from some
secluded part of the country inquir-
ing about Clyde Vaughan.

But the flip side ofthat exposure is
the fear of oversaturating the pub-
lic’s demand for televised sports and
specifically, televised college basket-
ball. Television ratings for all sports,
includir1g_such events as the World

Series and Monday Night Football,
have dropped.

“There is so much college basket-
ball on television, there will have to
be some fallout in the next three or
four years," admitted Big East com-
missioner Dave Gavitt.

“At this point, I don't think that
[fallout] will be us. The teams that
fall out ofthe picture will be the ones
that aren‘t playing well."

Performances aside, it helps that
the Big East encompasses five of the
nation‘s top l2 television markets —
New York, Philadelphia, Washing-
ton D.C.,' Boston and Pittsburgh.

“Advertisers still want to make
money," said CBS announcer and
ex-referee Billy Packer. “There is
now so much sports television that
advertising fees will have to go
down.

“if you have all of these games —
an ACC game, a Big East game -
then one game doesn't have the

importance that an exclusive game ’

would have."

The Big East‘s television commis-
sion, made up of the league‘s top
officers and three athletic directors,
will study the conference's television
ratings in May at the league meet-
ings before deciding whether too
much of anything, including college
basketball, is not a good thing.

“I think sports in general have to
be concerned," said NBC's Len Ber-

Pitt’s James
outstanding
at Easterns

By Gabrielle Pease
The Pitt News

Freshman swimming sensation
Rick James finished his first season
at Pitt by breaking two pool records
and gaining the meet’s outstanding
swimmer award at the Eastern
Regional competition last week in
Greenville, N.C.

James established records in the
200—yard backstroke with a time of
l:52. l0 and the I00-yard backstroke
with a time of 52.15. “He swam an
extremely good meet," Coach Fred
Lewis said.

James was pleased with the
results. “The pool was slow," he
said. “I broke two pool records that
were 15 years old."

Although the team did not have
the home-meet advantage enjoyed
here last month for the Big East
Championships, the team perform-
ance was not affected by it. Rather,
Pitt obliterated the competition at
this second and final championship
meet of the season.

“The figures are there to prove it.”

“Things have gone out of sight."
Packer said. “Some teams and con-
ferences have the potential to make
mind-boggling amounts of money.
But the poor will have a tendency to
get wiped out."

“It is a concern to all ofus that you
can reach a point where the value of
the product can be diminished by
overexposure.“ Bozik said. “With
everyone and their brother putting
games on television, there is hardlya
time of the day when you can't turn

game."

. Young’s $40 million contract

catches one scribe’s attention

By Dale Moore
The Pitt News

Since writing this column last
week, a few more things have caught
my eye from the world of sport.

0For those of you out there who
thought the New Orleans Breakers
were crazy for paying Marcus

DuPree $6 million over six years,
you must still be in shock about the
signing of Steve Young by the Los
Angeles Express.

Young, a alumnus of Brigham
Young University and a direct des-
cendant of Brigham himself, yester-
day put his name on one ofthe most
expensive pieces of paper in the his-
tory of sports. When the smoke had
cleared, and the media picked their
tongues up off the floor, someone
figured up that the Express forked
out $40 million to sign someone who
has never played a down of profes-
sional football.

For those interested in the spe-
cifics, just for signing his name to the
contract, Young got $2.5 million.
That figures out to a quarter million
per letter, if he didn‘t use his middle
initial. Young gets an annual salary
of $I.5 million with $30 million in
deferred payments that run until
Young is 65. Also in the contract
were a guaranteed $400,000 in
endorsementsand a $200,000 scho-
larship to BYU in Young's name.

Also, just to show that Young is
concerned about those not as fortu-
nate, there is a clause in his contract
that for each game the Express wins,
Young will make a donation, which
will be matched by the Express, to a
local charity. I wonder if he has ever
heard of the Betterment of Dale
Moore Fund.

And to top it all off. Young gets a
$I.5 million interest-free loan.
Here‘s a guy who just got $2.5 mil-
lion more. What does he need the
loan for? He said that his car is
broken down and he wanted to take
his girlfriend out to dinner, but a
million and a half‘? Some car. Some
dinner.

0With last weeks court ruling, col-
lege football as we know it may be
doomed.

Now that underclassmen are eligi-
ble to play professional football

. before completing college, college

football is in for major problems.
The NFL can't just sit back and let
all of the prized underclassmen go
the way of Herschel Walker and
Marcus DuPree and sign with the
rival USFL. Sooner or later the
NFL will get into the act. Los
Angeles Raiders owner Al Davis will
probably be the first to test the
waters, and the race will be on.
This trend could cause major
problems in the college ranks and
much more grey hair for college
coaches. Think about it for a second.
Imagine that you are Howard
Schnellenberger, coach of the
national champion Miami Hurri-
canes. You have Bernie Kosar, a
sophomore, returning after a fresh-
man year in which he led the Hurri-
canes to a 3|-30 victory over
then-unbeaten and No. I ranked

wake up the next morning, pick up
the paper and read about how your
prize recruit and center ofyourteam
has signed with some pro team for
some incredible amount of money.
Remove all sharp objects from
reach.

This scene could be repeated all
over the country as prize underclass-
men are snatched away to the pros.
And how far will it go? Will pro
teams sign kids right out of high
school? This may sound ridiculous,
but so does paying $40 million for an
untested quarterback.

l for one am not going to miss out
on this chance ofa lifetime. I already

0The Maulers gave defending
USFL champion Michigan Panth-
ers a scare last Saturday before los-
ing 27-24. However, for the
Maulers, the story was the same as

the week before —— no offensive line.
Only one of the Maulers’ three
touchdowns was scored by the
offense and Mike Roziers was
limited to 26 yards on ll carries.

The Maulers open their home sea-
son to a full house at Three Rivers
Stadium on Sunday against the Bir-
mingham Stallions. It is debatable
whether the fans are coming to cheer
for the Maulersor boo the return of
former Steeler Cliff Stoudt, now
starting quarterback for the Stal-
lions, who are l-I in the young
season.

Unless the Maulers find some
kind ofoffensive line in the next cou-
ple days, look for Stoudt to do
something he found difficult as a
Steeler: win.

0Former Pittsburgh Pirate Willie
Stargell in his book “Willie Stargell,
An Autobiography,” tells of how
former Pirate right fielder Dave
Parker disliked the fans in Pitts-
burgh. “He played out of hate and
revenge instead of love,” said Star-
gell. Come on, Willie. Tell us some-
thing we didn‘t already know.

0The United States Basketball
Writers Association picked their
All-America basketball team, and it
is one that everyone will have to look
up to. The five selected were Michael
Jordan and Sam Perkins from
North Carolina, Wayman Tisdale
from Oklahoma, Patrick Ewing
from Georgetown and Akeem Ola-
juwon of Houston. Now my only
question is, which one of those guys
was picked to play point guard?

The Panther tennis team opens itsseason tomorrow
when they travel to Tennessee

 F I T N

 Freshmen lead Panther

netters in Tennessee tour

By Scott Dellett
The Pitt News

The weather may not indicate it,
but with temperatures bordering on
freezing, the Panther tennis team
opens its season tommorrow
afternoon.

Pitt travels to Tennessee, playing
four matches in three days, starting
at |:3() against Maryville College, a
Division II school in Knoxville.

On Friday, Pitt meets Tennessee-
Chattanooga in the start of a two-
day quad meet. On Saturday, Pitt
plays two matches with Travecehia
College at-~9 a.m. and comes back the
following afternoon to take on Mid-
dle Tennessee State at l.

Tennessee State was scheduled to
meet the Panthers but forfeited.

The four matches will be the
beginning of a 20—match season for
the Panthers, who only managed to
complete half that number in 1983.

The number of matches is neces-
sary to give the squad experience.
And Pitt needs more seasoning than
usual, given the number offreshmen
in the top six singles positions.

Dave Johnson has taken the
number one singles spot, one offour
freshmen in the starting lineup. The
others are Jack Kalla (number three
singles), Rich Monteleone (number
five singles) and Chuck l)eVera
(number six singles).

The only returning letterman
starting for Pitt is Larry Lederer at
number two singles: Paul Rodri-

‘I’m happy to have freshmen in the lineup.
They're very coachable and open to impro-

vement. ’

—Ge0rge Dieffenbach

quez, at the number four singles
position, is a transfer from Purdue.

Despite the heavy graduation
losses and transfer of last year‘s
number one player, James McDo-
nald, to Arizona State, coach
George Dieffenbach is not downcast
about his position.

‘‘I’m happy to have freshmen in
the lineup,“ he said. “They’re very
coachable and open to improve-
ment. It’s nice to bring them in
together because they stay together.
It gives the program more stability.“

For the Panthers to develop a
competitive team. especially one
with the number of players missing,
it takes some good recruiting and a
little luck. According to I)ieffen—
bach. half of the team is made up of
the recruited players, while the rest
of the squad is composed of walk-on
players.

“[Developing a team] is a com-
bnation of good fortune, the reputa-
tion for the school and effective
recruiting,“ Dieffenbach said.

Pitt placed eighth in the Big East
championship last fall, a finish that
disappointed [)ieffenbach. This is
why the Panthers are facing one of
their most challenging schedules in
the team's history.

“That‘s why we have a tough sche-
dule -— to make ourselves stronger,"
I)ieffenbach said.

The schedule and the inexperence
of the team does not sour [)ieffen-
bach’s view for the team’s success in
I984.

“I‘m expecting a winning year: a
record of |l—9 or better.“ he said.
“All four freshmen will be competi-
tive. The maturity of the freshmen

will determine the success we have
this year."
Much of I’itt‘s success will also be

determined by the weather. Last sea-

I

son, the Panthers lost five matches -- f

according to Dieffenbach. five
potential victories -- due to the incle-
ment weather.

“We hope to have a good record
and some good weather,“ I)ieffen-
bach said.

The Pitt News, Wednesday, March 7, 1984

Senior Jeff Jelic (top) is Pitt’s only representative at the NCAA championships.

By Tim Dinger
The Pitt News

If the third time is indeed the
charm, then the time has finally
come for Panther wrestler Jeff Jelic.

Jelic will be competing for his
third straight year at the NCAA
Wrestling Championships, tomor-
row through Saturday at the Mea-
dowlands Arena, New Jersey.

Twice before he missed All-
America honors by a single win.

“I feel real good about nationals
this year,” said Jelic, “and I’m look-
ing forward to it. I’ve wrestled some
of the best kids in the country during
the year, and I know exactly what I
have to do to win; be aggressive and
stay intense.”

Head coach Rande Stottlemyer is
also excited about Jelic’s prospects
at nationals.

“He’s healthy and his technique is
great,” Stottlemyer noted. “There’s
no one in the country with better
technique. It’s just a matter of put-
ting it all together.”

Jelic, now a I67-pounder,
wrestled his last two national tour-
naments at I58 lbs. Moving up in
weight class is one major reason
Jelic is optimistic going into the
tourney.

“I don’t think I should have cut to
I58 (Ibs.) last year to begin with," he
said, “but since I did, I should have
cut the weight in a better way. It
caused me to have a bad season and
it was very frustrating.”

This year at 167 lbs. I didn't have
to worry about my weight. I worked
out twice a day and as long as I
stayed from junk. I was all right. It
took a lot of the pressure away.”

The combination of less pressure
and more experience added up to a
28-2 season record for Jelic, and will
likely put him into a third- orfourth-
place seeding going into the tourna-
ment, according to Stottlemyer.

“I never really worried about
seeding, although no doubt it will be
better than last year,” said Jelic.

“Two years ago I wrestled the

Third time may be a
charm for Pitt’sJelic

eventual champion in the first
round, and last year I wrestled the
eventual runner-up in the second
round.

“I usually don't have a very good
first match. I start slow because I’m
not really warmed up enough, but
after I get the first match in, I wrestle
a lot better."

“Jelic also attributes some of his
confidence to his summer training
with world class wrestlers, compet-
ing in the National Sports Festival.

“Last year I didn’t know how I
measured up to the other guys," he
said. “Now I know what I have to
do. It’s going to be the same old
story ———- mistakes are going to lose it.

“I want to be at 100 percent in my
technique. I don’t want to be flashy,
I just want to wear down my oppo-
nent, scoring most of my points in
the third period.”

According to Stottlemyer, Jeli’
has the mental attitude that it takes
to win the championship.

“If he just goes out and wrestles
like I know he can, he could be an
All America easy,” he said. “If he
really gets into it, no doubt he could
win it.

“lt’s Jeff's last year and I know he
wants to go out in a blaze ofglory. It
would only be an appropritfte end to
a great career."

Although Stottlemyer is optimis-
tic about Jelic’s chances for a
national title, there will be at least 3|
other I67-pounders looking to go
out in a blaze of glory also.

There are between 32 and 38
wrestlers in each weight class,
depending on how many wild-cards
are chosen.

Battling with Jelic for the top spot
at 167 lbs. will be the heavy favorite,
defending champion Mike Sheets of
Oklahoma. Sheets was also named
the outstanding wrestler at the
National Tournament last year.

Another thorn in Jelic’s side will
be Lehigh’s Jim Rielly, an All-
America last year. Rielly beat Jelic
earlier this year, 6-3, in dual meet
competition.

Although Jelic has beaten him

wice so far this year, Penn State’s
Eric Brugal is always a tough match,
according to Stottlemyer.

Jelic will also be looking out for
Missouri's Sheppard Pittman. Pit-
tman beat Jelic last year in dual m€-.~
competition.

Although Pitt is not in contention
for a top I0 team ranking, five other
Eastern Wrestling League teams
enter the contest with a top 20 rank-
ing, including No. 4 Penn State.

Penn State ended its season with a
I6-2 dual meet record, and is taking
eight wrestlers to nationals, includ-
ing three All—Americas.

Leading the way for Penn State is
I26-pounder Scott Lynch, a two-
time All-America who ended his sea-
son’s record at I I-2 aftefmissing tI.e
latter part due to knee surgery.

Penn State’s winning wrestler,
with 109 career wins, Carl De-
Stefanis was upset early in last year’s
tournament, but enters this year
with a 34-I-I record, and is currently
ranked second in the nation at II8
lbs.

Two other All-Americas, I77-
pounder Bob Harr and heavyweight
Steve Sefter will also be trying for
top honors.

Heavy favorite to win the team
trophy will be the University of
Iowa, the defending champion for
the last five years. Iowa finished this
year with a I6-I dual meet record,
losing only to Oklahoma, 24-6.

Upsetting them will be an incredi-
ble task as they are taking nine out of
their ten wrestlers to nationals,
seven of whom are All-Americas.

If it could be said that there was a
standout on Iowa's team, it would
have to be I58-pounder Jim Zaleski,
a two-time national champ, cur-
rently on an 84-match win stryyk,
posting a 32-0 record so far this year.

Iowa’s success is much the work of
their head coach Dan Gable, an
Olympic Gold Medal winner, but
this year Gable took off to help
coach the U.S. Olympic Team. In his
place is interim coach J Robinson.

NCA/\’s occupies
Pitt runners’ mind

By Dale Moore
The Pitt News

lhe Pitt Panther men's track team
may have had other things on its
mind last weekend when it traveled
to Princeton. N..l., to compete in the
l(‘4A championships.

(‘oach John Vasvary admitted
that the Panthers didn’t run good
races, but it didn‘t overly concern
him.

“I he two important weekends to
us in indoor track are the Big last
championships and the NCAA
championships,“ said Vasvary. “We
would have liked to do better than
we did, but this is the weekend that
counts."

lhis weekend. seniors lodd
Colas, Roger Kingdom and (iarland
Brown travel to the ('arrier l)ome in
Syracuse to represent the Panthers
in the NCAA championships.

Last weekend, (‘olas competed in
the mile and barely missed establish-
ing a new Pitt standard. (‘olas ran
the distance in 4205.9. missing the
old record of4:()5.2 set by Jerry Rit-
chic.

Brown didn't fare much better.
running the X()()—meter in l:57.37.
two seconds slower than his fastest
time over the distance.

“l ran a dumb race last weekend."
said Brown. “But this weekend at
Syracuse. I'm going to run just like l
did at Big East lchampionshipsl.“

lf Brown comes through on his
promise, he should return to Oak-
land with All—America honors.

Last weekend didn‘t prove to be
any better for the rest of the Panth-
ers. Senior Ralph Mitton went 47
feet in the triple jump, a sub-par
effort for the senior who jumped
over 49 feet at the Big East cham-

pionships two weeks ago.

One bright spot for the l’anthet‘s
last weekend may have been the per-
formance of the all-freshman mile
relay team. lhe quartet, composed
of Jesse Mikell, Shane Saunders.
Alan laws and ‘lim Manes, con-
tinued to run well, covering the mile
in 3:202. Although the time is not
outstanding compared to relay
teams from Seton Hall or Villanoxa,
it is an impressive showing consider-
ing the fact that it is an all-freshman
squad.

(‘oach Vasvary said he would
hate liked to have seen some better
performances but that just running
last weekend was more important
than winning.

“l felt that lodd and (iarland
should get into a race." said Vas-
sary “last year. 'l odd came out flat
at nationals, and l thought that it
may have been because he hadn‘t
raced in two weeks. ll you hate too
long off, you tend to slow down and
get flat. l didn't want that to happen
this year.“

TRACK NOTES:

continued from page eighteen

“The teams were more competi-
tive,” James said. Yet, Pitt proved to
be the strongest, winning the meet
by a convincing 2l7-point advan-
tage over host East Carolina.

Pitt’s three relay teams provided
the backbone for the team's success.
The 800-yard freestyle relay team of
Ed Bahan, Don Martin, J.D.
McCrillis and Greg Murphy cap-

tured first place with a time of

6:53.43. Ed Bergan, James, Martin
and McCrillis combined for a 400-
yard medley relay victory in 3:28.80.
In the 400-yard freestyle relay,
James, Martin, McCrillis and
Murphy touched first in 3:04.89.

Sophomore Don Martin shat-
tered two pool records held by
Olympic medal winners. In the 200-
yard individual medley, Martin fin-
ished first in 1:53.77, breaking
Charlie Hickox’s mark. Hickox was
a gold medal winnerin both the 1968
and 1972 games.

Martin won the 200-yard breast-

stroke with a time of 2:06.08. He

erased Brian Job’s record. Job was a

, silver medal winner in the I968 and

1972 Olympic games.

Coach Lewis, who was honored as
the meet’s outstanding coach, was
satisfied with his team’s season.

Although no one in the entire
Eastern region qualified for the
NCAA championships, Lewis‘s top
swimmers, Bergan, James and Mar-
tin have plans for the United States
swimming nationals later this
season.

The Panther divers still have one
more shot at qualifying for the
NCAA meet, though. They join the
Lady Panthers for a pre-qualifier
meet this weekend in Annapolis.

“The nature ofthe meet is tough,”
said Coach Julian Krug. -

The divers need to place among
the top five finishers on the boards
this weekend in order to qualify for
the NCAA meet. Krug believes the
two recent successful championship
meets, which the Panthers domi-
nated, will boost the team’s
performance.

Despite an ankle injury that had
sidelined him earlier in the season,
sophomore Mark McCormick
regained his winning form last week
at the Eastern Regionals, capturing
the top spot on the one-meter board
as well as the meet’s outstanding
diver award.

“I dove consistently,” said
McCormick. In addition to some
stiff competition from his own team-
mates, McCormick faced formida-
ble challenges from the University of
Maine divers. _

Mike McCaIley repeated his
impressive Big East performance at
the Easterns by taking second place
on the three-meter board.

McCalley and McCormick will be
joined at the pre-qualifier meet by
strong Pitt finishers John Dusch and
Todd Mulzet, along with top divers
from Penn State and the University
of Maine.

Laxmen defeat I
CMU...

The Panther Lacrosse Club
met Carnegie-Mellon at Pitt Sta-
dium and emerged on top ll-8
Sunday.

The Panthers took control
early, taking a 3-0 lead before
CM U was able to score. The Tar-
tans fought back to tie the game
twice, but the Panthers held a
one-goal lead after two quarters.

The second half saw the Tar-
tans falter before a controlled
Panther attack and an impenet-
rable defense, giving Pitt the win.

Scoring for the Panthers was
dominated by the attack. Pete
Francesschiner pumped in four
goals, Mark Jennings had two
goals and two assists and Paul
VanCura had a pair ofgoals. The
midfielders provided support as
Phil Kessler and Bob Benner
each added man-up goals and
Kessler cranked in a fast break
shot.

A physical defense was able to
keep the Tartan attack at bay.
lmportantly, the Panthers
avoided costly penalties. Goalie _
Dave Peary was superb, inspir-
ing the team with his extraordi-
nary saves.

“The team needs to work on
clearing and ground balls, but,
for the first game, we looked
OK,“ he said. “It was_ an
extremely satisfying win."

Bring an organist to the Field House,

By Tom Walsh
The Pitt News

0Since the Spirit and Georgetown
have an organ played during their
games, Pitt should consider an
organ for the Fitzgerald Field
House, with Vince LaSchaad
returning to the Pittsburgh sports
scene.

0The only publicity campaign
worse than Jack Schrom’s “I Hate
Philadelphia" drive for the Pirates
home opener against the Phillies is
the John Glenn Presidential
Committee.

0This week at Madison Square
Garden, Pitt will beat Villanova
then lose to Syracuse by one point in
overtime. Pitt gets an NIT bid and
loses in the semi-finals to Weber
State.

Sunday will feature the Pittsburgh

the Reds. Keep your helmet on,
Cliff.

0Yogi Berra will lose his first 25
games, and George Steinbrenner
hires Billy Martin, who has the Yan-
kees beat the Red Sox 10-] and
Steinbrenner fires Martin for not
being offensive enough. Stein-
brenner then hires Pirate coach Joe
Lonnett as manager, the only person
controversial enough to meet
George‘s tough standards. More to
follow.

OWith or without John ‘Candela-
ria, the Pirates have the strongest
pitching staff in the entire National
League. With great pitching and
batters who hit for average and not
power, the Pirates will win the NL
East a la the I982 St. Louis
Cardinals.

0Now that the Penguins have
three first round draft picks, the only
way that the front office can mess up
the I984-85 Boys of Winter is to
draft Gordie Howe, Joe Blake and

be in charge of a Japanese minor
league team, ‘who barely misses
making the playoffs.

0Since last year’s Final Four were
all teams with red ,uniforms, this
year will be all blue with North
Carolina, Georgetown, DePaul and
Kentucky. The only sleeper with any
chance is UNLV.

0If Dave Parker sues Willie Star-
gell over Stargell‘s book, this writer
will sue the USFL’s Los Angeles
Express for not signing me for $40
million as an armchair quarterback.

Owhatever happened to Bob
Veale?

0The Pittsburgh Spirit, who will
definitely make the playoffs, will
outsell the Penguins in season ticket
sales next season. In two or three
years, the Spirit will be drawing over

Henri Richard.
