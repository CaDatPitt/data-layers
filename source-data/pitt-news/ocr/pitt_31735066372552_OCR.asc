Marchers Picketed

Over 30 members from the
' city’s various pro-choice groups
picketed Saturday’s “Greater
Pittsburgh March for Life” in
protest of the anti-abortion
J standpoint.
According to Elizabeth
Drescher, one of the protesters

graphy and Media, some 35
individuals representing such
groups as Squirrel Hill NOW,
Planned Parenthood, and New
American‘Movement, picketed
the pro-life marchers in front of
Heinz Hall—the sight of a pro-
life rally——with posters and
chants calling for a woman’s
right to make a choice and the
need to keep abortion legal.
"‘A woman has a choice to
control her own body,”

Drescher said. f‘Most women
who have thought of having an
abortion, do not entertain the

Prof Tumbles Through The Tenure Process 

By SETH LUBOVE

At the end of this term, Robert
Kauffman, an assistant professor in
the music department, will clean
out his desk in the music building.

He will leave the university after
five years of service in teaching and
in researching his specialty, ethno-
musicology. Though proud of his
accomplishments in his field, he is
bitter because of thereasons sur-
rounding his departure.

Kauffman has been given what is
euphemistically referred to as a

,2 V “notice of non-renewal.”

How your health fee is distrib-
uted, who can use the Student
Health Service and the availability
of health insurance were some of
the questions raised by three stu-
dent groups at last week’s Univer-
sity Senate Student Affairs
Committee meeting (USSAC).

The Student Health Service,
located in Brackenridge Hall, is a
university-operated outpatient
clinic available to all full-tirne stu-
dents except those in the~College of
General Studies (CGS). All stu;
dents except those in CGS pay a 1321,
health fee ‘per term that funds the
service. L ‘ -

of the SHS, said 75 percent of the

Or, in the language of anybody
who has ever been denied tenure
here at Pitt or any other institution
of higher education, Kauffman has
been fired.

After going through every possi-
ble appeals procedure available,
Kauffman, 52, thinks he is the end
product of a tenure system that
relies more heavily upon research
and publishing than on teaching
and giving attention to students.

There have always been com-
plaints such as Kauffman’s about
the tenure process, but it wasn’t
until he was denied tenure that

Kauffman recognized the validity
of those claims.

“It seems to me that scholarship
and research are playing an unusu-

~ ally heavy role here, and""1t’s a ques-

tion of whether that should be the
case. Working with students has
not been a high priority,” Kauf-
fman said. 2
Kauffman came to Pitt in 1977 as
a visiting professor from the Uni-
versity of Washington in Seattle,
where he had been an assistant pro-
fessor fornine years. In 1978 Kauf-
fman was given a three-year
appointment as an assistant profes-

   
 
 

sor in the music department.

When his three-year appoint-
ment was nearly completed, a
third-year departmental review of
Kauffman’s performance. was
initiated, the outcome of which
would play an important role in
whether to award tenure.

A ballot was held by the tenured
faculty of the music department
last February, and a recommenda-
tion was made by a 4-2 margin that
‘Kauffman be awarded tenure.
From there, Kauffman’s case was
brought before a six-person review

health fee goes to staff salaries and
fringe benefits, 20 percent for con-
tract services (for example, sending
out for clinical laboratory work or

3 X-rays) and the remaining five per-

 

cent for health education. V
Student Government Board
representative Robbieghe said he
was very concerned over the man-
agement of funds within the SHS.
He said one of his campaign
pledges was to help strengthen the
SHS because some students would

,:.1:ne rm New Messier,» Ja99art,1.!§- .‘9-82

pay the health fee and not know the
service existed.

“This total amount of student
money comes to nearly $700,000
per fiscal year," The said. “Stu-
dents can see how their activity fee
of $25 is used for instance by fund-
ing the Pitt Program Council, but
not‘ necessarily how their health
fees are used.”

The said some of the student
money in the category “fringe
benefits" went to pay SHS staff
social security taxes and health
insurance/

on

“This (the percentage of student
money spent on fringe benefits) is
approximately 23 percent of all
student health fees," he continued.
“Why not reallocate that money so
the SHS can either expand its use-
fulness or institute an emergency
facility there?" ‘

Carter confirmed that money is
being used to aid‘SHS staff in pay-
ing their taxes and insurance pre-
miums. He added, though, that
thisis not an «uncommon practice.
He said other universities use this
procedure, and it can be found

within other departments at Pitt.

The Graduate Professional Stu-
dent Association (GPSA) represen-
tative, Robert Zei, was mainly
concerned with the price and avail-
ability of insurance for graduate

D students.

Most graduate students at Pitt,
he said, have no family physician
in the area because they tend to
come from places far away. Under-
graduates, because they tend to
come from Pittsburgh and sur-
rounding areas, are more depen-

dent and thus usually do have a
personal physician, he noted.

. ‘‘I would not like to see the insur-
ance premium raise especially for
graduate students,” Zei said. “If it
must,’ though, an increase in the
premium must be accompanied by
an increase in coverage.”

‘Z81 said he was generall_y pleased
with the SHS otherwise. He was
told bv Carter that many improve?

ments were being made. _
Carter said these include a
decrease in waiting time, an
increase in nurse personnel, extra
dermatological and gynecological

hours and more preventive medi-,

cine such as the dispersment of,

, literature on how to stop smoking.

"If the center had no space lim-
itations, it _’could be even more
effective,” Zei said. “I do notthink

ment facility, because we have
them right across the street and it
would raise student health fees
drastically.” ~

A representative of another stu-
dent group, Cheryl Tomko of the

CGS council, said approximately’

100 CGS students wouldilike to
subscribe to the SHS.

Secretary of the USSAC, Dr.
Lawrence Epstein, said this “prob-
lem" started nearly six years. ago.
He said that back then CGS was

given a choice; it would be manda- .

tory for everyone in the college to

pay the health fee or no one could

get service.

“lt’s a small minority of CGS
students who are stuck,” Epstein
said. “It’s ethically wrong to deny
these students, but it’s a shame.”

The Assistant Vice Chancellor of
Student Affairs, Dennis Donham,
said this subject will be pursued in
the future, however. .

He said one of the schools insu-
rance strategists, Nancy Graham,
will be working hard toward a
solution with cooperation from
Carter and the university
community. _‘

“I understand the development
of events back then when CGS
voted no,” Donham said. “Back
then, their voice was listened to and
the university community com-
plied. Hopefully a mutually
beneficial solution will be found in.

Michael Margolis

isy DIANE SCIULLO

Some college professors do
have a sense of humor. .

Michael Margolis, associate
professor of political science at
the University of Pittsburgh.
has tacked on his office door
one of those famous postcards
of Ronald Reagan, with his
head sticking out of a jar ofjelly
beans and some of his teeth
blackened out. “Expert sees lit-
tle hope for future” is pinned
above it. ’

Margolis, a graduate ofOber-
lin College with an M.A. and
Ph.D. from the University of
Michigan, calls himself a mild
liberal Democrat “if you have to
use labels.” He said most politi-
cal scientists in the United
States tend to be liberal, while
economists tend to be
conservative.

When he’s not teaching, Mar-
golis spends his time as a
member of the committee on

A curriculum reform, as a profes-

sional consultant making pro-
jections and predicting election
outcomes for local media and
political parties, and as author
of three books (Political Strati-
fication and Democracy; Amer-
ican Government; Viable
Democracy) and numerous arti-
cles on subjects ranging from
Vietnam to lobbying.

“I’m generally happy about
the outcome of curriculum
reform,” Margolis said. “My
general view of liberal arts edu-
cation is that it should be broad-
based and students should
complete work in three major
natural
science, and social science."

Margolis said he was
unhappy about specific privi-
leges that the natural sciences
claimed and said in essence that
any department including pol-
itical science could be madejust

cifically,

reform as a whole beneficial to
everyone. 4

Another issue Margolis
researched was direct district
representation.

Last November a weird com-
bination of three yes or no ques-
tions, proposed by the city
council and Tom Flaherty spe-
asked Pittsburgh
voters to consider if they wanted

0 elections at large as done
now

0 elections by nine districts or

0 elections by a mix of seven
by district and two at large.

Margolis and Pitt graduate
student Khondaker E. Haque
undertook the project of analyz-
ing the effect of direct district
representation, as opposed to
the current at-large system, on
the city of Pittsburgh.

“I follow local politics,i’
Margolis said, “and this was a
certain issue (direct. representa-

Action) coming up. Political

scientists elsewhere across the
coun_try were studying it, mak-
ing predictions about it., ‘and we
decided to see what difference

.district representation would

have on the city of Pittsburgh.”
Margolis and‘ Haque pro-
jected, based on 1979 and 1981

election returns by school dis- .

tricts, that the nine-district
council plan would probably
differ by 4 members from its
present make-up.

Michelle Madoff, Jim O’Mal-
ley, and Robert Rode Stone, all
residents of the 5th district,
could not serve together,
according to Margolis and

«Haque. As well, Sophie Mas-

loff, a 4th district resident,
could not serve Shadyside’s
Tom Flaherty or Oakland’s
Eugene DePasquale. The
winners by district representa-

tion would be, according to
Margolis, Flaherty and Madoff.
The Northside and Southside
would also receive greater
representation.

The projections also give
some evidence that blacks
would do “numerically better"
under the by district plan.

But district representation
will stilldy plugged for. “There
are those (here),” Margolis said,
“who feel district representa-
tion is more democratic than at
large representation and it —has
been the case across the
country.”

When all the November votes
were counted, the council was
left with a contradiction. Spe-
cifically, one group claimed to
have gotten the most votes for
maintaining city-wide elec-
tions, while a second group
claimed to "have the most votes
for district representation.

The council decided that the
two majorities cancelled each
other and nullified the entire
poll, so things stay the same for
now, said Margolis.

Margolis also said the coun-
cil may not have presented the.
questions in a straightforward
manner, thus undercutting the
credibility "of city council and
sabotaging district’ repre-
sentation. . ,

Each majority, he said, may
be able to bring a law suit
against city council because the
council has no legal precedent
for nullifying the poll. Council
argues they can, by established
city ordinance, change over to
district representation.

Currently, Margolis is
researching the impact of pro-
and anti-abortion political
organizations on the’ demo-
cratic process, and writing a
book on data analysis for

advanced undergraduate stu-
dents or beginning graduate
students.

Section 438 of the General Education Provisions Act, as amended by Section 5TB of Public Law
93-568, referred to as the “Privacy Rights of Parents and Students," (more commonly called the "Buckley
Amendment") requires that Pitt give notice to parents and students of the following information.

The Buckley Amendment is designed to protect the privacy of students. ‘In order to do so, These
provisions are binding on the University: . ' P

-Individual student records include -only information -necessary and relevant to the educational
purposes of the institytion. ‘ , ‘

-_ -Student records are openfor inspection by students or parents of students under l8 years of age upon

I -Students have a right to challenge the accuracy of records. V

-The institution may not-release student records outside the institution withoutstu.dent consent, unless
one of several exceptions applies. - '

—Requests external to the institution for information regarding students should be documented, as

, Some Pitt faculty and stu-
dents who are frustrated by the
shortage, of parking space in
Oakland are going to great

./lengths to secure themselves a
spot, but their actions may cost
them $300 or 120 hours of work
in the University Parking
Office.

Forged parking permits for if

university-owned lots are circu-

' lating around Pitt according to

Jan Thomas of the Parking

Office.

Students caug-ht using the
counterfeit permits facejudicial
board proceedings, and guilty
faculty members will have to
pay‘ the Parking Office for the
period of the infringement,
Thomas said.

Campus pol/ice havecharged
about 30 people with theft of
services for using the fake per-
mits since last January, Tho-

-mas said. .
She said the counterfeit per-

g mits have been found by secur-
~ ity guards at the various Pitt

lots. The fake permits have been
both hand-drawn and machine
copied, Thomas said. »
“The officers and guards
really have to keep a close eye
out,” Thomas said. “There
have been a couple that looked

almost exactly like the
originals.”
Why does someone go

through the trouble of pain-
stakingly Copying a $25
(approximately?) parking
permit?

“Spaces are valuable,” Tho-
mas said. “We have four times
as many peopleas parking spa-
ces. A parking permit is actu-
ally a hunting license’?

Parking permits cost faculty,
staff and daytime students $25
to $30 each month, Thomas
said. College of General Studies
students pay $10 for evening
permits. /-

Daytime and ‘graduate stu-
dents can‘ apply for permits at
the Parking Office in thefirst
floor of the Forbes Quadrangle.

CGS students should apply at ’

the Cathedral. '

Pitt Prof Tum bles Through Tenure Process

continued front page one
‘committee of the dean of the

-r~»rt-Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS).
-«IE

fter reviewing Kauffman's doss-
ier, the vote to award Kauffman
was split 3-3.

From there, both rec-
ommendation‘s——the department’s
and the review committee’s— went
to FAS Dean Jerome Rosenberg for
a final decision. At that point,
Rosenberg was forced to make a
decision on the basis of non-
unanimous votes, and in April he
decided to deny Kauffman tenure.

“The dean was not given a
strong vote. I was a borderline
case,” Kauffman admitted.

 Kauffman appealed the, dean’s

decision, and an appeals panel was
formed last May. Unfortunately for
Kauffman, the appeals panel voted
in October against awarding him
tenure. As a final effort, Kauffman
asked the chancellor to appoint a
hearing board to review his appeal.

But the buck stopped there.
Chancellor Wesley Posvar, in a
Jan. 6 letter, told Kauffman “the
decisions by the department, the
review committee, the dean and the
appeals panel are those that reaso-
nable people, acting in good faith,
would have reached. The process
was fair, impartial and carefully
done.”

 “I am, therefore, declining your

request for a hearing board and
directing that the dean’s decision
be permitted to stand.”

“I don’t think there’s any more I
can do at this point,” Kauffman
admitted, adding that at his age, he
will have a tough time finding a
similar position at another
university.

In the meantime, Kauffman
remains upset with the dean’s and
the appeals committee’s decision to
deny him tenure. 1 \

“My major surprise in this
whole process and major conten-
tion is that Pitt is applying its own

V judgements of scholarship that are
contrary to judgments of experts in

0 'he field,” he said. i‘

As part of his appeal, Kauffman

 

 

 

." I) lst prize autoeraphedfootball ofthis

  

 

had asked the appeals committee to
write to nine internationally recog-
nized ethnomusicologists for their
response to Dean Rosenberg's rea-
sons for denying Kauffman tenure.
Five of the requests were answered,
all of which “enthusiastically sup-
ported my scholarship and found
the dean’s criticisms wrong or
inappropriate,” accpording to
Kauffman.

Although the responses from the

outside ethnomusicologists were
favorable. Sarah Gray Thomason
of the department of linguistics
and chairman of the appeals com-
mittee, said that the responses were
not enough to recommend recon-
sidering Kauffman for tenure.
_ In an Oct. 9 letter to Provost
Rhoten Smith, Thomason wrote:
“We do not feel . . . that these letters
are of sufficient weight to move us
to recommend a reconsideration of
Dr. Kauffman’s case, because, with
one exception, they are lacking in
specific analytic comments."

Kauffman, however, said the
committee had “ignored” the let-
ters from outside experts. A

, “They ignored all of the letters,
and I’m wondering why they sent
them out if they weren’t going to
use them for evidence,” Kauffman
said, '

From the perspective of hind-
sight, Kauffman describes the
tenure process at Pitt and other
universities as a “very unfair
process.” '

“One is judged on very subjec-
tive and nebulous criteria,” he said.

Tenure, according to FAS guide-
lines, “is awarded for demonstrated
excellence together with the prom-
iselof continued excellence in scho-
larship, in whatever form that
scholarship takes. Teaching and
research (or creative activity), the
two principal functions of the uni-
versity, are also the two principal
forms of scholarship.” ‘

Kauffman contends that
although he has had 31 articles
published but no books, much of
his time has been devoted to his

teaching, and that his teaching.‘

 

abilities weren’t sufficiently con-'
sidered by the dean.

“I have put the students’ interest
above anything else,” Kauffman
said.

Dean Rosenberg, however, con-,

tradicted Kauffman‘s "assertions
about his teaching abilities.

“Your classroom teaching has
been described as competent but
not exciting. Although you have
had graduate students elect to do
their dissertations with you, most
of them have been persons from the
Western Pennsylvania region.
This in itself is not undesirable,
except that it points out your
inability so far to attract students
from a broader region to work with
you," Rosenberg wrote in a May 4
letter. '

Kauffman contended that he did

r 1

in fact attract students from outside
the area.

Rosenberg, because the tenure
process is confidential, would not
comment directly on Kauffman's
case. Rosenberg admitted, how-
ever, that it is more difficult to
receive tenure today than it was a
few years ago duegto recent budg-
etary restraints and declining en-
rollments at the university.

“When the university was grow-
ing in the ’70s we could afford to
have somewhat lower standards”
for awarding tenure, Rosenberg
said. “It is certainly tougher to get
tenure now,”he added, emphasiz-
ing that tenure decisions are not
based upon quotas. /

“Tenure is not automatic and to
be expected. A positive case has to
be made for each individual,"

---Page 7

Rosenberg said. /’

Last year, 15 people were
awarded tenure from non-tenured
positions, while four were denied
tenure. Prior to that, in the 1979-80
school year, 13 were people
awarded tenure from non-tenure
positions while 12 were denied
tenure.

Kauffman said he realizes that
the university is under financial
stress, but that that shouldn't affect
the tenure process.

“I think that because of the inse-
curity of budgets and enrollments,
it’s not the right psychological
time to raise these issues. Although
the system is so entrenched, there
should be more concern with fair-

ness in the proceedings.” Kauf-

fman said.

  Cheer Up

He’sibeen an institution at Pitt athletic events
for nearly 10 years,‘and during that time has
survived other attempts to havehis act cancelled
at Fitzgerald Fieldhouse and Pitt Stadium. N ow,-
it looks as if the final curtain has come down on
Tiger.Paul Auslander, the unofficial Pitt cheer-
leader whose only fault seems‘ to lie in doing a
better job of inspiring Pitt sports crowds than
the real, university-sponsored cheerleaders.

Unless you’ve‘ been living in a void for the
past three or four days, youknow the fireworks
that erupted at last Thursday's Pitt-Duquesne
basketball game when Tiger Paul was banished

from the court -by Athletic Director Cas ‘P

Myslinski—apparently at the behest of Karen
Agostinella, Pitt’s cheerleading coach.

It all ended ceremoniously ‘when Tiger Paul
cast his Pitt sweater at Myslinski and »took_ his
seat in the reserved section of the bleachers. Not
known to be a  person, Tiger Paul appeared
on local radio1tal'k shows and a television news
broadcast the next day to proffer his new alle-
giance to Duquesne sports. . I

- It’s inconceivable that the Tiger: Paul inci-
dent has gained the media attention-it has, and
Tiger Paul -certainly wasted no opportunity
making the most of it as the newly-found celeb-I
rity of this past weekend’sDapper Dan festivi-
ties. ‘At first he declared his new loyalty to
Duquesne, but in a televised moment of reflec-
tion, he said he was havirig a difficult time
making a decision what to do—--seeing a chance
to milk the situation further. It’s no secret that
Tiger Paul is paid for his on-court hijinx, and
some say his real loyalty lies with whomever
puts the buck in his pocket. This apparently is

what most disturbs Agostinella—that someone

of Tiger Paul’s nature and presence would do a
far superior job of inciting a crowd than her
university-funded cheerleaders.

i To us, the whole incident is simply childish
and petty. Whether he is right or wrong, or
whether he does it only for money, there is no
doubt that Tiger Paul has what it takes to fire
up a Pitt crowd. In the long run, this is the only
true purpose of any cheerleading squad. It’s
time for everyone involved—Tiger Paul, Mys- e
linski and Agostinella—-to grow up, put aside
their differences, and work toward a common
effort. If they don’t, it will only be the spirit
cultivated at Pitt sporting events that will suffer
in the end. if

Cheer About at Pitt.Games

A Dear Edi tor:

The other evening I attended my’
first basketball game of the 1982
season. The Pitt team played well

. for a large crowd of men, women

and children, but the performance
of two other student groups, the
cheerleaders and the dance unit of
the band, left me shocked and sad-
dened as a female member of the
university community.

The function of these organiza-
tions is .to provide Pitt ‘students
with opportunities to develop and
display their talents, and at the
same time-‘to provide the student
body and the larger community
with entertainment. The routines
of these two units fall short in both
of these areas. -

The cheerleaders have generally
focused on. the gymnastic and

« dance skills of "the squad members,

and have provided the fans with an ‘
esprit de corps and some breathtak-
ing moments. While most of their

performance the other -night was
consistent with their award-
winning performances of the past,
the new routine involving punk
rock dance movements was in poor
taste. I have no objections to the
inclusion of “contemporary”
dance movements into their rou-
tines, but I do object to the por-
trayal of violence against women
in this and other contexts. In sev-
eral parts of the routine, the male
cheerleaders make slapping move-
ments at their female counterparts’
heads, which then snap back as if
hit. There are also several move-
ments representing the choking of
the female partner. I found this
routine to be completely offensive,
and it is (hopefully) irrelevant to
the function of encouraging enthu-
siasm in the crowd. .

The official sponsorship of these
movements, combined’ with the
sponsorshipcof the female dance
unit of the band makes one ques-

tion how the university views its

Do Any Copy Machines In The

Library fWork.?    

Dear Editor, I

This weekend I found myself in
need of a copy machine because I
had reading materials for a class
that I had to mimeograph.
Although copying reading can be
considered as only a minor nui-
sance on other college campuses, at
Pitt it’s a true test of wills.

A rough estimate of the number
of copying machines in Hillman
library would be, I would say,
about two to each floor, or 10. And

a rough estimate of how many of

' signs on them would be about the
same. I finally ended up having to‘

use the copying machines at the
law library, which I gained access
to only by groveling in front of the

female members. The dancing unit
of the band appears to be'concen-
trating primarily on the sexual tan-
talizing of the male fans, rather
than on the display of well devel-
oped dance skills.

I doubt if the university would be
proud of having the reputation of
having the best looking male bas-
ketball team who wear the tightest
uniforms, regardless of the attend-
ance figures such a unit might pro-
duce. I also doubt if the symbolic’
portrayal of male castration would

 



 

 

be seen as appropriate entertain-ml."

ment for a crowd of men, women

and children. It is my hope that

these groups will become more
cognizant of their responsibility to-
all of the Pitt fans, and that the

university would offer its female

students an opportunity to develop

and display talents which ‘trans-

cend gender stereotypes.

I don’tthink it’s too much to ask
for somebody to fix at least one or
two of the machines. Maybe if that
task proves too difficult, Pitt could
hire a scribe (work study, of course)
to do all the copying. That may
sound ridiculous, but at least it
would be better than what the
library offers now-nothing.

Persist: What Now?

 

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

Rebounding._It’s to basketball
what tackling is to football. Ev-
erybody takes it for granted, but it
has to be done. The Pitt Panthers
have been taking it for granted.

Actually, if you listen to Coach
Roy Chipman, he’ll tell you his
team just doesn’t have the people to
rebound effectively. There may be
some truth to this. Pitt’s biggest
man, 6-9 Steve Beatty, has been like
a pinball getting bounced around
inside. Reserve ‘freshmen center
Andre Williams has a willingness
to rebound but as yet doesn’t have
the stamina to go 40 minutes.

Roosevelt Kirby, the much-
heralded power forward, has been a
tease. He’ll show flashes of
brilliance—as in Friday night’s 72-
62 loss to Duquesne, where he
pumped in 14 points and at other
times he’s just not in the game.

The rebounding has been so
woeful that Pitt’s small forward,
Clyde Vaughan, has been the lead-
ing rebounder. At times he has
been the front line.

Still not satisfied? You want to
talk numbers? Okay, let’s talk
numbers. In the Duquesne game,
the Dukes more than doubled Pitt’s

/rebounding output. The figures
were embarrasing: 55-24, That’s
not beating your opponent on the
glass, that’s pounding them into
submission. More numbers?

Pitt is dead last in the Eastern 8
in rebounding at 33 a game. West
Virginia is first with 42-43 a game.

One of the main reasons Pitt is
, not rebounding is its defense. Whe-
reas last year’s l-3-l zone was quick
enough to jump out and harass a
ballhandler, then still come back to
rebound, this season’s version is,
comparatively speaking, goinggat a

snail’s pace.

Those wingmen aren’t Sam
Clancy and Lennie McMillian,
they’re Kirby and Vaughan. Don’t
even try to compare them in quick-
ness. it’s not close.

Pitt Swimmers Edge PS U

  By SEAN BARNES I

The Pitt Panther swim team

5 defeated Penn State 62-57 in a cliff-

hanger Saturday in the meet’s final
event, the 400-yard freestyle relay.

Pitt led 55-51 before the last
event, which left it up to Pitt’s relay
of Pete Doyle, ].D. McCrillis, Jerry
Zaleski and Ed LaNoue to decide
the meet’s outcome. Their first

place time of 3:ll.l captured the
meet’s final points and the win for
the defending Eastern Champion
Panthers.
Although many of Pitt’s

swimmers turned in their season’s

hottest times, it was a cold meet in
other ways due to heating
problerns—-the temperature on the
Penn State pool deck hoveredinthe
low 605, which prevented any qual-
ity warming-up or staying warm
once in the water.

But the need to bundle in two
sweat suits between events did noi
hamper Pitt’s always-powerful
performer, Sandy Pidgeon. Pid-
geon, last season's NCAA Eastern
Regional most outstanding
swimmer and conference record
holder in the 200—yard breast stroke
and 400-yard individual medley,
did not even swim his favorite
event(breast stroke), yet went on to‘
be the meet’s only triple winner.

Swimming 68 laps
events, Pidgeon won the 40-lap,

1000-yard freestyle, the 20-lap, 500-.

in a three’

\

yard freestyle, and the eight-lap,
200-yard individual medley.

Both his I000-and 500-yard free-

style times beat not only his current
season's best, but also his 1980-81

season’s bests. Pidgeon’s excellent
stamina is not surprising because
of his hard weight training pro-
gram and fast sprint times in last
week’s opractices, according to his
coach and teammates.

Also in superb form were Rick
Carter, LaNoue and Ed Bergan. All
three won two first places and one
second place. LaNoue, a freshman,
placed first in the 50-yard freestyle
and second in the 100-yard free-
style, while senior co-captain Car-
ter followed him in the 50-yard
freestyle to take second place and
led in the I00-yard freestyle for
first. In the 50-yard freestyle, junior
Pete Doyle took third to complete
Pitt’s sweep. j

Carter and LaNoue’s other first
place finishes both came from
relays. LaNoue anchored‘ the final
meet-deciding event, the 400-yard
freestyle relay, while Carter
anchored the meet’s opening event,
the medley relay. Both relays were

crucial Pitt wins because of the

trecent loss of Pitt’s Eastern Cham-
pion diver, Mike Minik. Minik’s
loss thus gave Penn State a much
easier time in winning the two div-
ing event and the 16 points that go
with those events.

. The .9P¢'?in.s .400-igaxd, msdlsr  

relay of Bergan, Geoff Emore,
Doug Condon and Carter powered
to a 3:32.85 finish——over three
seconds ahead of Penn State. Fresh-
man backstroker Bergan lead the
relay witha four-lap backstroke
split of 52.4, a time that would have
beaten even ex-Pitt star Stu Swan-
son, a four-year winner of the
NCAA Eastern Regional 100-yard
backstroke competition. Swanson
graduated last season.

-Bergan’s outstanding backstrok-
ing ability was again conspicuous
in the individual 200-yard back-
stroke. His time of 1:549 claimed
first place easily. Bergan’s second
place came to Pidgeon in the 200-
yard individual medley, where the
one-two finish was crucial later
when Penn State went on to domi-
nate the next two events, the one-
meter diving and 200-yard
butterfly.

Overall, it was a meet that went
as Pitt Coach Fred Lewis had pre-
dicted. “It was ameet that didn’t
allow us to make any mistakes.
Considering how bad warming up
was, out sprinters camethrough in
the events they had to. Doyle came
within three-ouarters of a second of
his Eastern Regional 50-yard free-
style time of last season. That’s
whatHI_g_like to see,” Lewis said.

Hopefully for Lewis, the
improving will continue as Pitt
heads into three consecutive road
meets.  ~.  W a

Tiger Paul Auslander has vowed not to return to cheer for the Pitt
basketball team this season after he was asked to stay off the ‘floor

during games at Pitt’s Fitzgerald Field House.

Quit. Since Tiger Has

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

For 10 years, Tiger Paul Aus-
lander, Pitt. Panther basketball’s
unofficial and, as it’s been pointed
out recently,um'nvz'ted cheerleader
had patrol‘ed the . floorboards of
Pitt’s Fitzgerald Field House incit-
ing crowds into what borders on a
frenzy.

For seven of those years, Pitt

\ cheerleading coach Karen Agosti-
nella has ‘watched and wished
Tiger Paul would stop it.

In the furor surrounding Tiger
Paul’s much-publicized vow not to
return to cheer for Pitt this season--

Auslander says he may even go to

work for crosstown rival Duquesne
(grimace) if they’ll have him--—

Pitt’s principals in the fray, Agosti— ,

nella and Athletic Director Cas
Myslinski, have been soundly cri-
ticized in the aftermath.

' In newspapers, on television and
sports talk shows and, you can be
sure, in more than a few Pitt dormi-
tory rooms, Myslinski and Agosti-
nella might have. been less
reproached had they merely admit-
ted they enjoyed kicking small
animals or disliking children.
Agostinella, beleaguered and sensi-
tive to the criticism, admits as
much with a sigh. After seven
years, she maintains she had just
cause to go to Myslinski and
request that Tiger Paul be barred
from cheering on the floor. Her
most oft-repeated reason is the boo-
ing her squads suffer through
when they venture out on the floor
to lead the cheers.

It’s grossly unfair to Pitt students
who are cheerleaders, when they
are more than capable of doing
what he’s doing, to have to endure
any more of the booing that they’ve
been asked to endure,” Agostinella
explained. “If we go out at the
same time (as Auslander) or go out
by ourselves, the crowd is waiting
for him, and they boo. When

you've been booed time and time.

again, it becomes very difficult.”
There are other reasons for Agos-
tinella’s disenchantment with
Tiger Paul, a 38-year-old High-
land Park resident. Past attempts to
work with him have failed because,
according to Agostinella, he is
undependable. And, while the Pitt
cheerleaders receive no retribution
for the time and effort they devote
to their duties, Auslander has been
getting paid to cheer this season by

some’Pitt boosters afterhe refused ;

ﬁr. ;,

to cheer for free in the Panthers’
first four home games.

. Agostinella says she’s been told
by people connected with Pitt~——
“no one in the administration”—
that Auslander has been paid in the
past by “Pitt backers" who enjoyed
having him at games. And, Agosti-
nella says, that bothers her.

“I was concerned he was getting
paid. This situation, to me, is
incomprehensible,” Agostinella
said. “He comes when he feels like
it, stays home when he feels like it.
He lias no allegiance to Pitt. He’s

, already said he’d cheer for'any-

body.” Agostinella sighs again, her
voice laced not with venom, but
rather, a weariness that results
from yet another request to recount
the same, tired refrain.

“It’s not jealousy,” shesays of

her stance against Auslander. “We '5

put too much time, too much
effort, into this to get intojealousy.
The crux of the problem has been
over the years that Pitt’s cheerlead-
ers are more than capable of lead-
ing the crowd. The team feels the
same way as I do. They felt they’d
be wasting theirtime coming to the
games if he’s going to be there.’.’

Agostinella, who monitors every
basketball game, checking her
squad’s performance, says crowd
reponse has been good when Aus-
lander doesn’t show up. And so,
Agostinellla confronted Auslander
at the recent Pitt-Rutgers game and
told him to stay off the floor. When
Tiger Paul turned to walk away,
she says she put her hand on his
shoulder to stop him and said,
“You're going to listen to me this
time.”

Tiger Paul listened, but when
the Panther team jogged out on the
court for Thursday's game against
Duquesne, he was » there on the
floor, cheering as usual.

Later in the game, following a
message from Myslinski to stay off
the floor and cheer from hisset if he
wished to cheer at all, Tiger Paul

took a seat in the reserved section ’

directly across the court from the
Pitt student bleachers and refused
to cheer again.

When Pitt rallied from a 10-
point deficit to knot the game at
55-55, a roar went up from the
standing crowd. “Tiger, Tiger,
Tiger," they chanted. And, for the
only time in 10 years that anyone
can remember, Tiger Paul just
shook his "head and sat. When he.
did stand up, it was only to hurl his

Pitt Wrestlers Crush Millersville for

A 3%

By TIM DINGER

 The Pitt Panther wrestling team
pushed its season’s record to 2-0
last Friday by downing the
Marauders of Millersville 26-9 at
the Pitt Field House:

The surprising 17-point margin
of victory was built on the strength
of outstanding performances by
the Panthers. Freshmen Rich Ess-
wein (118) and Frank Vulcano
(190) and sophomores Craig
Richey and Jeff Jelic were singled
out by Coach Rande Stottlemyer as
having the key wins.

It was Esswein that started the
ball‘ rolling when he decisioned
Marauder Rich Marshall 6-4. Ess-
weein came back after trailing 4-2 in

the first period to chalk up his‘

second win of the year.

At 126 pounds, sophomore Joe
Throckmorton kept Pitt’s momen-
tum going) by handling Scott Conn
6-3. The win pushed Throckmor-
ton’s record to 9-1 for the year. '

At 134 pounds, Panther Craig
Richey avenged last year’s 9-2 loss
to Tim Frey by winning a 3-2 deci-
sion. Richey came back in the third
period by reversing Frey to tie the

score at two. He then rode Frey the V

rest of the periodlto accumulate
1:03 advantage time, enough for
the point and the win. Richey’s
record moves to 4-2.

Marauder, Kevin Shenk cut
Pitt’s nine-point lead to six by nar-
rowly defeating 142-pound senior
Glenn Nacion 5-3. Nacion injured
his knee in’ the third period and
almost stopped the match, but
rather than give up the six point
default, he went on to finish the
match. His record falls to'7~4.

Sophomore Jeff Jelic moved his
record to 5-1 by dominating Mil-
lersvi11e’s Arlene Mummau 17-2 in
the 158-pound match. Jelic scored
two takedowns and two nearfalls in

 the first period to take an 8-1 lead.

When the match was completed,
Jelic had scored five nearfalls, two
takedowns, -and a reversal for the
superior decision. _
Freshman Doug Haines replaced

“Eric Harris at 167 pounds to battle

Mi1lersvi1le’s Mike Connor.

tough match.

Randy Marchcmade it two in a
row for the Marauders by shutting
out ’ Pitt’s Jeff Wilps 6-0 at 177
pounds. . . .

-~-At 190 pounds freshman Frank
Volcano grabbed his second colle-
giate win the same way he got the
first one——with a first-period pin.
He wasted little time in barring up

' Chip Easterday of Millersville and

pinning him at only :39 into the
period. ‘

Heavyweight Dan Kasperkoski’

was another Panther who saw his
first action of the year. Kasper-
kowski defeated Eric Meyers 6-4.
Stottlemyer was pleased with the
overall team effort of his wrestlers
but warned, “lt’s only the begin-
ning, not the end." He also said he
hoped that the win will give the
team . momentum going 3 into
tonight’s home match against
Lehigh. The match will be the
team’s‘biggest challenge of the sea-

son thus far. Lehigh comes in!

sporting the No. 3 ranking in the
East, and ranked No. 8 nationally.
In last year’s match Pitt was blown
out 41-0, and the Panthersshould
have their- hands full again
tonight. Lehigh head coach Thad
brings - four nationally
ranked wrestlers into the Pitt Field
House. ,

Despite Lehigh’s formidable cre-
dentials, Stottlemyer is optimistic
about Pitt’s chances because of
Lehigh’s recent road trip. that
could give Pitt enough of an edge
to pull an upset. During the road
trip last week,
invaded the state of Iowa to wrestle
three nationally ranked teams: No.
2 Iowa, No. 3 Iowa State and No. 13
Northern Iowa.

The Engineers start out tough at ‘

118 with sixth-ranked Bob Weaver
against Pitt’s freshman entry, Ess-
wein. Weaver was a member of the
1980 U.S. Olympic wrestling team
and won the World Cup Freestyle
Charnpionshipi in that same year.

Fifth-ranked Tom Husted will
test Pitt’s Throckmorton in a
rematch of last year’s battle at 126.
Throckmorton lost 17-6 in their
last meeting, but this year’simatch
is too close to call. Throckmorton

the Engineers J

Conn of Millersville;

goes for his 10th win of the season
against only one defeat.

Pitt’s Richey‘ will get a shot at
Lehigh senior Pete Schuyler at 134
and, at 142, Pitt’s John Settineri
steps in for the injured Nacion to
wrestle Engineer Frank Vresics.

The 150-pound match features '

Pitt’s Mike Bond against eighth-
ranked Tom Bold. ' "

At 158 pounds, Lehigh’s Roy
Lobdell faces Jelic while at 167
pounds, Pitt’s Haines (0-2) will
see action against Jeff Newman.

At 177 pounds, Wilps (3-3) will
challenge, LeHigh’s Benjy Dudek,
and Volcano (2-0) will face second-
ranked, two-time All-American
Colin Kilrain at 190.

In the heavyweight bout,. Kas-
perkoski will wrestle Pat Brown of
LeHigh.

It is an important match for the
Panthers (since it is their first test

‘against a Top 10 team this year.

Lady Panthers Fall to NC’ State

By MARIE HUFF“

The big newsiabout this week-
end’s Wolfpack Doubleheader at
North Carolina was that the Lady
Panther basketball team was not
there, at least not for the first game.
Pitt’s flight on Thursday night was
cancelled after closing of the air-
port -in Raleigh, North Carolina
and the Lady Panthers’ flight was
rescheduled to leave Pittsburgh
International Airport at 10:05 am‘.

Friday. 1‘
But the trouble didn’t stop
there...
According to Pitt Assistant

Coach Randy White,_the plane was
taxiing down the runway when
word was received that the Raleigh
airport was still not open and the
plane had to turn around and wait.
The Lady Panthers waited all day,
finally boarding 8% flight at 7145
p.m.

It does not take a mathematician
to figure out that Pitt did not make
it to their 7 p.m.-contest with North‘
Carolina. The Lady Panthers did,
however, play seventh-ranked
North Carolina State Saturday
evening, only to lose 72-63. Since it
is unknown at this time whether
the Lady Panthers will have to for-
feit the game with North‘ Carolina,

Chipman has begun to realize
this. Against Duquesne, he came
out in a tight 2-3 zone, before

‘switching to the 1-3-1. Against

Penn State he used the 2-3 again.
Unless the right chemistry’ can be
found, _the 1-3-1 might have to be
shelved temporarily.

I It would be much easier on
Chipman if the problem were one-
fold, it is not. After four straight
losses, the problems are mounting.
Besides a defense that has been
shredded by opponents’ big men

inside, and some hot outside shoot-.

Clyde Vaugharr was held in checl. by Duquesne’s box-and-one
defense Thursday.

        we ould like

The Pitt IfTews,rtMonday,6:Iannary '18, 119%; 

ing, notably by Duquesne’s Terry
Teachout and George Washing-
ton’s Wilbert Skipper, Chipman
also has to begin looking at his
offense. Or lack of it.

When Pitt was 8-2, and nobody
was complaining, the offense was
‘Clyde Vaughan in double figures
every game, Dwayne Wallace in
double figures, and then take your
pick—Kirby one game, then Gis-
sendanner, maybe Chip Watkins or
Williams. The only sure thing
about the offense was /that!

’Vaughan and Wall,lac_e would

crack double figures. In other

w

lllilllllllml

enough, V . by

.:

words, it was two-fold.

While Gissendanner started to
show sparks of bridling his
immense talent (-25 points against
Tennessee), he hasn’t been-consis-
tent enough. Or, assertive enough.
Gissendanner, at times, has looked
unstoppable. In one three-minute
burst against Rutgers he scored six
quick points and no one could stay
with him. Other times, he has been
just another player in the
background.

Meanwhile,‘ Steve Beatty has
flopped at center. In the Panth'er’s
double-overtime loss to_Penn State,
their fourth consecutive loss,’
Beatty took but two shots from the
field in the entire 50 minutes. We’re
talking Big East next year.

When your center only takes two
shots in a game, it makes an oppos-
ing defense’s job oh, so much,eas-
ier. Scouting reports start to home
in on the weakness, “Don’t worry
about their center, he won’t shoot,
concentrate on Vaughan and
Wallace.”

And that’s just what Duquesne
Coach Mike Rice did on Thursday.
By continually switching defenses,
Rice challenged Pitt with two dif-
ferent box-and-one defenses. One
of them isolated on Wallace who,
upon passing the ball away, found
it difficult to regain it. The other
put freshmen standout Darrell
Shepperd on Vaughan. Shepperd,

;a jumping jack, is quicker than

Vaughan and two inches taller.
Sheperd stuck to Vaughan and
barely, allowe him , breathing
room. *

Two—fold, remember? Take
those two out of thegame, and your
chances ‘of beating Pitt are good.

Now, we see Chipman’s head-
ache. There’s more. Wallace, has
not been playing like Dwayne Wal-
lace and you see-why four games

. have gone by without a win.

In all fairness to Wallace, he has
not reached top shape after under-
going off-season knee surgery. Out
of shape, playing 38 minutes a

game, and expected to up a lifeless .

offense-—it’s a burden_ that even
Dwayne Wallace cannot shoulder.

Chipman tried to pump some
life into his offense, ironically
slowing it down
against Penn State, a team that
often embraces the same strategy.
Coming out in a stall, Pitt worked

if for the backdoor, which is a pretty

sane move by coach who must be

 Gymnasts Fallwith A

 Help fromilnjuries

'" By BRIAN BALK

The barrage of injuries finally
caught up with the Pitt Lady
Panther gymnastics team as it suf-
fered its first'l0ss to the University
of Maryland l-32.45-123.15,
Saturday. ’

According to’ Pitt head coach
Donna Sanft, a number of factors

contributed to the loss, especially‘,

“the exceptionally low scoring” on
the floor exercise.

However, Sanft emphasized that,
“We can’t dwell on excuses, wejust
had a bad meet. We have to look
ahead toward the future with a pos-
itive outlook.” I t
“We can’t dwell on excuses, wejust
had a bad meet. We have to look
ahead toward the future with a pos-
itive outlook." ~

One bright spot for the Lady
Panthers was the performance of
sophomore Karen Martin. Martin

captured a third place in the all-

around competition. She also M
earned an 8.75 score for her uneven

bars routine and took first place in
the event.

Another performer worthy of
merit on the otherwise sullen after-
noon for the Lady Panthers was
senior Holly Martino. Martino
excelled with a first place on the
vault with a score of 8.0 and took
fifth in the all-around competi- .
tion.

  

‘ The major downfall of the Lady
Panthers was their numerous falls
onthe uneven bars and beam.

“We accounted for five falls on
both the beam and bars. It was dif-
ficult to make up for the five points
that were automatically dimin-
ished from our score,” said Sanft.

In the floor exercise the Lady
Panthers turned in their best per-
formances, but Sanft said the
judges’ scores failed to reflect the
fine execution.

“Everyone hit their routines,
from their tumbling runs to their
dance moves. I just don’t know
why our scores weren’t higher,"
Sanft said. ‘ A

Another drawback which made
the going "tough for the Lady
Panthers was their lack of depth.
With several key gymnasts out with
injuries—-including the team’s top
scorers, Lisa Shirk and Babbie

-. Flock—the team could not make

up the slack. ' V.
Junior Gretchen Spiech was

‘limited to only one event, the

uneven bars, because she was ham-
pered by two sprained ankles. “We
started out on a ;bad foot in the
uneven bars,” said Sanft.

Next Saturday the lady gymnasts
travel to Michigan to. meet last
year’s 17th-ranked team, Michigan
State. According to Sanft, Michi-
gan State always has one of the
strongest teams in the country.

Lady SwimmersBreeze Past PS U T  

V The Pitt Lady Panther swim
team, led by triple-winners
Amy Jackson and jan Ujevich,
soundly defeated Penn State 80-’
60Saturday at State College.

. Jackson powered two wins in
the l00—yard and 50-yard free-
style and the 50-yard butterfly,
while her fellow‘ ‘All-America
teammate Ujevich roared to vic-
tories in the 200-yard and -100-
yard individual medley and the

I 50-yard breaststroke.

The Lady Panthers domi-
nated the meet by capturing 12
first-place finishes in 16 events,
as first-year coach Dave Belo-
wich predicted they would.
What wasn’t so expected was

Pitt’s glut of second-and third-
place finishes as well. Going
into the meet,‘Belowich was
slightly cgncerned that Penn
State could keep the meet close
by racking tuptpoints with run-
ner-up finishes. Saturday there
was no reason for the coach's
concern.

“We totally dominated the
meet,” said Belowich, who
notched his second dual meet
win as Pitt head coach. “We
prepared very well and our
training ‘has paid off. I could
name every person on the
team——they all did a really good
job.” . -

“Penn State put out their best
team and we beat it by three
seconds,” ._BClOWlCh said. “We
showed a lot of improvement.
It’s nice to see it happening,
from a coaching standpoint.”

Belowich was generally
pleased with his team's early

condition of the team as it

the court, they took very little time
to prove that they were not affected
by the previous day’s adversity. Pitt
had powered their way to a 25-13
lead midway through the first half.
However, as the team has done in
several other key games, the Lady
Panthers ran into trouble with offi-
cials. Several Lady Panthers got in
foul trouble, and North Carolina
State got back in’ the game. At the
half, the score was knotted at 35-35.

North Carolina State held a nine
point lead with less than five min-
utes remaining in the game. The
Lady Panthers quickly sliced that
lead to three with 1:35 remaining.

I-Iowever, North Carolina State .

’ capitalized on four consecutive Pitt
turnovers to gain the victory.
“We played well until the final
"two minutes,” said White. ‘We just

times by several tenths of a second.

cation at the end, and NC State was
able to put the game away. We just
didn’t have time to recover.”

Pam Miklasevich had 21 points
to lead the Lady Panthers, and
Carol Dugan had 13. Pitt point
guard and leading scorer Debbie
Lewis suffered an injury to her left
thumb, and Gail Aughburns
played the final fifteen minutes of
the game with four personal fouls.
Both were key factors in the Lady
Panthers’ defeat. Lewis’ injury is
not expected to keep her out of
action.

Barring any further complica-

tions in travel, the Lady Panthers
will be in Bloomington Indiana on

with 31 points. '

The brisk times the Panthers
have been turning in almost trou-
tinely in the early season has Pitt
(303611 Mike Agostinella
“enthused” about his team’s

_ progress.

“It was a really good perfor-
mance for such a low—key meet. I’m
pretty excited. When you get five

ers, it’s a really strong perfor-
mance,” Agostinella said. A

Agostinella attributed the team’s

attitude. i

“Attitude is the key to this whole
business. You have to be willing to
