Await lvlillrose Battles

Cinder big wigs representing

~ every collegiate section of the na-

tion, gather tomorrow afternoon

in Madison Square Garden for the

year's toughest competitive and
most complete bit of track action,
the anxiously awaited Millrose
Games. O’

Here, East meets West in one of
the indoor season’s star-studded
affairs. With the cancellation of
the Boston Knights of Columbus
meet, this meet gains even added
prestige and the program already
scheduled is one of the best in the
35 year history of the games.

The cream of the Big Ten crop
will head the western contingent
into the Gardens to attempt to un-
dernfine the Eastern track teams.
Among them will be Notre Dame,
always a strong contender.

The “Jungle Cats will have only
four representatives in the meet
with “Hap” Stickel, “Bullet Bill”

Carter, Bob Smith, and Al Peretic ,

carrying the Blue and Gold colors
in the mile-relay. Of this quartet,

, only Stickel and Carter are veter-

an performers in this track classic,
‘While it will be the ﬁrst taste of
big time competition for Peretic
and Smith. Although handicapped
by inexperience, the Panthers stand
an even chance to come out on top
when the smoke of battle clears.
And according to the spirit that
these boys possess, there isn’t a
team in the country regardless of
its championship tag.» that will

match strides with them. “Bullets

'Tlie Women’

Half aihundred women and a man
met Tuesday nightto read the lines
of “The Women.” ‘

The women who read the lines
were students trying out for roles
in the last Pitt Players production
‘of this semester which will be pre-
sented on March 12 and 13. The
man wasiBuell Whitehill, director
of Pitt Players.

From the 53 finalists, 35 were
chosen to be “The Women.” “Cast-
ing for this play was one of the
most difficult tasks I have encoun-
tered,” said Mr. Whitehill. “With
so many capable women to choose
from and with so many different
roles to ﬁll, it was quite hard to
select an ‘ideal cast.” ..

Rehearsals began Wednesday
night and will continue daily, until
the play is produced in March,

Whitehi“ said.

lTen women were chosen to play
the leads and 25 students were cast
in‘ supporting roles.

Jeanine Stephenson, C42, is cast’
as Mary, a woman who is “too
nicely smug.” Crystal, the siren, is
played--by Jacqueline Fike, C42.
Sylvia, whose part was made fam-
ous by screen star Rosalind Rus-
sell, is portrayed by Marian Boggs,
C44. One of the less feline parts,
that of Edith, is acted by Phyllis
Cohen, C44. ‘

Jean Garland, C42, is cast as the '

child Mary. Peggy, another lady of
the circle, is Harriet Wragg, C44,
and Alma Spann, C44, is cast as
Nancy, one of the few single wom-
en in the play. Peggy Martin, C43,
plays Miriam, the chorus girl.

Defense Stamp Committee

By WILLIAM PANKUCH .

On February 18, approximately .

ﬁve months before the battleship
Iowa will be launched, the Univer-
sity Defense Stamp committee will
officially open their local drive.

A special booth will be set up
in the ground floor elevator lobby
where defense stamps and booklets
will be distributed. After handling
the sale of stamps personally for
the first two weeks, the commit-
tee will turn the booth over to oth-
er campus organizations which
have already volunteered. to‘ help
lllvthe drive.

Composing and publicizing an
attractive national plan at other
schools is one of the more import-
ant problems now receiving seri-
ous consideration from the com-
mittee, said Jack Brady, C42, pub-
licity director.

But no detailed and completely or-
ganized set-up has yet been formed

Wood Carvings Shown
In Fine Arts Gallery

German, jtalian, French and
English wood-carvings of the six-
teenth and seventeenth centuries
will be on display for two weeks
beginning today, in the Fine Arts
gallery on the seventh ﬂoor. Accom-
panying these carvings are a few
Italian and Dutch drawings of the
same period, which were contribut-
ed by Dr. George Clapp, president
of theboard of trustees.

The drawings, done by anony-
mous artists were found in an old
attic where they had been unno-
ticed for many years. The wood-
carvings were borrowed from the

to be presented as national pub-
licity. Without being able to quote
exact facts and statistics, any ad-
vertising gn a national scale would
‘necessarily be ineffective, Brady
pointed out, and the local commit-
tee could not present any plan to
other schools before Pitt’s own
drive has attained any amount of
success. ‘ 
“Althoughthe ultimate goal of
the committee is to extend the
drive to a’ national collegiate has-
is, this cannot be done until Pitt
has its own system operating effi-
ciently," concluded Brady. He fur-
ther points out that the local group
will have the task of convincing
the other schools to join the cam-
paign, and that the complete unsel-
ﬁshness of the local committee will
have to be made apparent.

A Blank forms to be ﬁlled out by
volunteers are still available in the
offices of the Dean of Men and the
Dean of Women. -Volunteers may
sign up for national publicity work,
local publicity, stamp sales, poster
design, or secretarial work.

Dr. Carlson Discusses Hospitalization,
Tliree Types Of University Students

E'ditor’s note;

Following 28 the last of on series
of articles about student hospital-
ization, on insurance for hospital
care which covers _everything from
illness to Mr rand mywries The
story today relates actual cases of
Pitt students.

By SIDNEY KLEIN A

There are three types of Pitt
students, according to Dr. H. C.
Carlson, director of the Men's Stu-
dent Health service.

The first type of student is the
one who does not have student hos-
pitalization and knows he does not
have it. There are many of this
type, reports Dr. Carlson.

“They do not realize the money
and worry that hospitalization in-
surance can save until it is too
late,” he said.

Dr. Carlson cites one case of a
boy who was approached last au-
tumn on the subject of enrolling
50!‘ hospitalization insurance. Said

Law School May 

Lower Requirements

By no ROSE

Two years of college soon may be  _
for entrance into law school if a recent recommendatlon of the P
Pennsylvania Bar association is adopted by the University

School of Law.

Under the decision of the Bar association the law school is permit-g
teded to register applicants who have completed satisfactorily not less ’

than two calendar years of study
Gilmore, dean of the School of Law
revealed today. i

The executive board of the
School of Law has not yet met to
consider whether the entrance re-
quirements of the Pitt law school
will be reduced to conform to this
act of the Pennsylvania Bar asso-
ciation, Dr. Gilmore said.

Students now in the School of
Law will be permitted to complete
three years of law study in two
years if they take advantage of
the accelerated program of study
now in effect, according to Dr. Gil-
more.

At the meeting of the Pennsyl-
vania Bar association committee of
legal ‘education and admission to
the bar, held on January 29 and
attended by Dr. Gilmore, reports
were heard on recent actions of
the state board of law examiners
designed to adjust the program of
preparation for the bar to the
needs of those candidates who are
or may be subject to service in the
armed forces.

iv The following statement was om-
thorized: 

“In recognition of the national
emergency and the effect of the

. Selective Service Act on the com-

pliance with the existing require-
ments for admission to the bar,
the board will permit the registra-
tion of applicants who have com-
pleted to the satisfaction of the
respective law schools not less than
two calendar years of study in an
approved college. ’

"The board has approved the
acceleration of the law school
course, without reduction in. the
content or lowering of attendance,
by use of summer sessions, to per-
mit the completion of the day‘
course in not less than two calen-
dar years and of the night course
in not less. than three calendar
years. V

“The board has sanctioned the
combined course of academic and
legal study to enable students by
three years of college study and
three years of law school study or
their accelerated equivalents, in the
same or different approved insti.
l7‘1t1011S. to obtain a college degree
and a law degree.

"Thgpurpose of the amendment,
ich provides for equal represen-

ternity students is to:
1) Eliminate fraternity versus
yn-fraternity political campaigns,
that the best representatives of

.gi'es’to the Pitt contribution to
defense effort. '
,‘ .  ~Give the 3,000 non-frater-
liity students an equabchance to.
ake‘ decisions on student defense
ojects and to participate in these
projects. Because these students do
not ‘belong to an organized frater-
ity is no reason why they should
not have an equal say and an
equal opportunity. A

hat this means.

The ‘music world, in the past 60
days, has been overwhelmed with
arravalanclie of war songs, writ-
ten by every other song plugger in
the nation. Among the more promi-
nent ones are: “You’re a Sap. M!‘-
i_Ja,'p,”* “Goodbye Mama (I’m Off
toi'YokohamaY’ f-‘Feed That Eagle”
andvthe most popular “Remember
Pearl Harbor.” :' '

 But the 99¢; that should‘ attain
great heights is the lovely ballad
“fDear Mom,” now being featured"
by Sammy Kaye and Kate Smith.
-“Mom” tugs at the heart. of every
. soldier and every mother.
Sweeping across the Pitt campus
tlte past two weeks has been that
‘luscious blues number “Blues .in-
tlie Night.” Among the bands that
vhave\1'eco1'ded “Blues” are Benny
Goodman, Harry James, Cab ‘Cal-
loway, and the best in our estima-
‘ ftion, namely Woody Herman. The
“better vocal arrangements include
Bing Crosby and Dinah Shore. ’Tis
said that college students can
sense a hit faster than others.
' -‘From all indications “Blues in the
Night” will be the nation’s No. 1
song very soon. . '

made "their Red Cross contribu-
tions at-‘their jobs. How could they
know this when-the current sys-
tem of representation, for example,
gives non‘-fraternity engineers one
representative ?. .

(2) The Victory dance also fail-
ed to reach its goal because tick-

_ets were ‘sold by “saddle-shoed,

elaborately-coiﬁ"ured campus big

shots” to the usual crowd of dance-

goers, rather than attempting to

reach the commuter student who

rarely attends a University dance;

and because a fraternity-dominat-

et social committee permitted other

social events to take place the same,
week-end, thereby crimping the

Victory dance.

Only when the 3,000 non-frater-
nity students have equal represen-
tation can student government
gain the complete Ebnfidence and
participation of the whole student
body——-a vital necessity if Pitt is
to do its best in helping to bring
victory to America. V

nist this week,"z's a vrepo-rte-r for
the PCW"‘Awjo'zv,” and has fre-

qtuentilp contributed to that pag-

per’s gossip colzmm. Miss Sluect
is an able young lady, fast talk-
ing, sharp as a bayonet, and quite
pretty. She is well known at PCW
and up to now has had many
fr~z'ends at Pitt. ~-
With exams over we can turn
our minds to the more serious sub-
ject of love (course offered nightly
'8—12). I could say something about
Bud Loutzenheiser but why waste
space on a dead pigeon? The past
week, must have been a red letter

week as far as “pinning” is con-

cerned. D. J. , gave PCW’s Peg
Matheny his PiKA pin, Jack Stauﬂ’
ﬁnally pinned Midge Frobuck, and
likewise Bill Heckman, Ann Delp.

With the new semester well un-
der way there are still a few’ ques-
tions hanging ﬁre: Did Dick Grif-
fith spend’ last Sunday night look-
ing for the hammock at Hooli-
gan’s? Who invented the Fixel sys-
tem of going steady? lsn’t there
someone who can get Charlie Owl
away fromthose Friday‘~nights at
home?

PCW sends orchids and old lace
to the. nice Delts we know:
Andy Patterson, (he rates pretty
high at PC) Jack Stauif, Dick Grif-
ﬁth, Jim Clawes, and Dave Naley.

Is the Bill Phi1lips——Margie Hig‘-"

gins ﬁre still kindling? Another
thing: It looks like Louella Jane
McConnaug'hy and various other
Tri-Delts are trying to get‘ A-rk
Svenson back. ’

Man of the Week: Tom Barr."
Thisis the chance that all Pitt has.

been" waiting for! At last we "can
put Tom on the receiving end of
the slams; of course, “we must do
it the nice way” (Quote Tom Bar.)
Tom's that little man you see run-
ning through the Cathedral but-
ting his nose into everyone’s busi-
ness, but we-must remember that’s
his business. He’s very conceited,
gself-centered, flippant, and hand-
some (just ask him). Give him two

or three beers and he gets very

sentimental.

He brags about dating all the

girls with a fabulous stagline, even

though.it’s usually only a one date,

affair. But all facts considened we

named him man of the week be-
cause he’s a pretty swell guy and '

deserves all he can get (we’re sure

that he ‘makes certain he gets all 

he can.) We admit he’s a swell guy
and Pittpourri wouldn’t be what it

is without him. (Ecl27tor’s note: I.

A rugged and determined bunch
of Mountaineers came to town last
Wednesday night to battle the er-
ratic Pitt Panthers, and battle they
did, for a more bruising game was
never seen in the local pavilion.
After the dust had risen from the
fracas, the West Virginia squad
showed a decided advantage of
66-47. V .

Ringling Brothers circus had
nothing on the Panther-Mountain-

eer game for there was action in
every part of the floor. One could

watch little Dick Kesling tie Eddy’

Straloski’s stadium mark by throw-
ing in shots from every angle, Doc-
tor Carlson go through his antics,
or worse still, watch the referee.

 The "game started off like any
other average collegiate tilt nat-
urally would, with one team scor-
ing, then the next. During this lull,
La.rry Paffrath, who, incidentally,
had a ﬁeld day for himself’ by
scoring 20, kept the Blue. and Gold
cagers_,in the game by,_d1'opping
through. several long shots. P 4

Pitt "held a slight 15-13 edge at
the endtof the first quarter, but the
show was just starting. Pittsburgh's

foul. The ball game continued,
then Carlson again disagreed. It
cost the Panthers another techni-
cal foul. The West Virginia.-Pitt
basketball tilt started once’-again,
and the red-headed actor.-_ also
» started. Another technical.

The Pitt team was rather thank-

' 1' ul that the half ended at that point

for their coach seemed to be run-
ning out of_-words. Pitt, despite
The Act, held a 26-25 advantage at
halftime.

Things went back to normal with
the start of the second-half, but,
unfortunately for the loyal follow-
ers of the Panther, Kesling did not.
He kept his red-hot pace by scor-
ing 8 points.

The Mountaineers showed their
true strength during this third pe-
riod for they began pulling away
from the rapidly faltering Pitt
forces. Malarkey played his usual
steady brand of ball, but the com-
bined forces of Baric, Hamilton,
and Kesling seemed a bit too much.

“Scotty"’ Hamilton, ﬁery temper-

-ed Hill Billy, thrilled the large
- crowd by his clever ball handling.

His shooting was erratic, but his
defensive work more than made up

»for his pointless evening.

V With the Blue and Gold basket-
‘eers on the short end of the 44-36
count at the start of the final quar-
vter, they got their second wind.

Another chapter in one of the craziest basketball seal}
sons, seen in this district for many years goes into the-books

tomorrow night when Pitt's disappointing Panthers travel,

down to Beaver Falls to meet a surprising Geneva squad. This

will be -the second meeting of the two schools this year, the 

Panthers having trimmed the Covies on the Stadium ﬂoor,‘

51-38, earlier this season.

y

An example of just how crazy the current cage campaign

has been is seen in the fact that Pitt beat Geneva; Geneva '

beatDuquesne; Duquesne beat West Virginia; West Virgiiiia

beat Penn State; Penn State beat
Pitt; and Geneva defeated, and then
lost to, Westminster. All of which
seems to indicate anything can and
will happen tomorrow night in
Beaver Falls.

It was against the Covenanteiis
that “Blond Bomber” Larry Puff-
rath got hot and scored 24 ‘points.
Since that game Pafi'rath has come
through with 69 points, including
last VVednesday’S\ game against
West Virginia. Thus, Paffrath now
has a total of’ 126 points for a nine
game average of 14 tallies per con-
test.

Since the first Pitt-Geneva fra-
cas, the Covies have faced the
cream of the district's basketball
crop and have surpassed the fond-
est hopes of their most enthusias-
tic followers. They set the high-
flying Duquesne Dukes back on
their heels in what was supposed
to be the upset of the season.

Just to show their triumph over
the Dukes was no ﬂuke, the Covies
trimmed the number two team of
the district, Westminster, a few

nights later. More recently the
Ransonmen threw a scare into
Westminster again, but were de-
feated in the closing minutes of
the battle. ,
In the first meeting of the Pan-
thers and Corie:-:,. Dan “‘\7ish” Vis-

ciarelli, Bob Palmer, Johnny Moyer -

and Johnny Ray’/. showed that they
were not to be taken too lightly
and no doubt will cause plenty of
trouble before the jqame is over
tomorrow nigrlit. Playiiig on their
home ﬂoor, Geneva will hold the
$.(l\'antuge that Pitt held over them
in the game played at tlic Stadium.

The Panthers will probably be

in a ﬁghting mood after ‘Nednes-’

day night’s debacle, against‘ the
Mountaineers. They have been
both a gootlteam and a bad team
thus far this season, and once
again are under the 500 medioc-
rity mark.

A win over the Covies will bring

the team back up to the .500 spot,  
and will give them another cha.n"ce_ »:?-1

to get up where they*rightful_ly
belong. ’

A9ainstNittany Lion Team Tomorrow

By PAUL cnncnnum
One meet, one markon the right
side ofvthe ledger; that’s the record
of "the Panther varsity swimming
team up to the present time..With
a good rest after that great win
over Rider College, followed up
with some still’ workouts in Trees
Pool, the squad is conﬁdent of add-
ing another win in their victory
chain at the expense of the Penn
State team this Saturday at 8
o’clock in the Pittsburgh Athletic
Association pool.
‘ The present“ season, is the sev-
enth in which. Penn State has_ had
a swimming team, this sport being
the youngest of the intercollegiate
activities on the campus. Though
it's untested as yet, this year's
team is expected, to be fairly
strong in all departments.
Lettermen returning ‘to varsity
competition for the Nittany Lions
are: Tom Reissman and Ted Taylor
in the breast stroke; Captain Elmer
VVebb and Charles McCarthy in the

back stroke; and diver Ralph Er-T

win. Don Del Manzo, star distance
man upon whom Coach Robert Gal-
braith was counting heavily ‘ for

garnering a large share of points,
did not return to school this year.

The Pitt tank specialists turned
back the State squad last year with
a score of 46-29. All statistics point
to a repeat performance, but there
is a possibility that an aroused
Lion squad will disappoint the ex-
perts by doing a complete about
face and taking the measure of the
Gold and Blue aggregation.

Gus Wilde, greatgsprint man, is
expected to keep up the high cali-
ber of work that he has cut out
for himself in the Rider meet.
Wilde has been improving steadily
and is being counted on by Coach
Ben Grady to assure the team a
majority of points in the ‘dash
.events. Wilde will also be swim-
ming in the anchorman position
when the relay team goes into ac-

,tion. ». ‘ '

Teamingup with Wilde will be
such steady performers as Cap-
tain Herb Cosgrove, Eastern In-
tercollegiate breast stroke champ;
Al Samson, Joe Orloff, Ralph Wilde,
Marty Kramer, Mat Vitaris, Joe
Kaule, Hyman Kurran, Stan Sut-
nik, Al Mason, and Herd Krongold.

CRUSTIN, Texas, Feb. 6.—Duiing
the two months that the US has
-been at war the nation's college
women have been taking twice as
much interest in helping with vol-
unteer civilian defense work as
men students. A national poll of

C . "Student Opinion Surveys of Ameri-

ea completed last week shows that

 the ratio of those engaged in this

new work is three out of ﬁve col-
ege women and less than three of
every ten men—excluding those al-
ready in the armed services.

Most of the defense work being
done by the men was reported to
.be taking defense courses, but this
number amounted to only nine per
cent of the men students inter-
viewed. Women chieﬂy have been
knitting and learning first aid. De.

fense duties of the nation’s men 7

and women students listed by per-
centages are:

lNot included in the tabulation
was the number of students in reg-
ular curricula studying courses that
are regarded as directed toward
the war eﬁort——-engineering, medi-
cine, physics and others.

The survey also revealed that
only one-fourth of the nation’s stu-
dents have ever experienced a
blackout.

Corsages Banned

By l-F Council

A resolution for the prohibition

a GE corsages at all University danc-

es was unanimously adopted by an
Interfraternity council last Tues-

 'day,« Carl Stein, C43, Pi Lambda

Phi," and vice-president of. IF an-
nounced today. _
He stated that the resolution will
be presented to the Student-Fan
lulty association at the next meet-
' ing Wednesday.
At the IF ball the no-corsage
-policy will be carried out. Stein
said, and any corsages which are

. brought’ to the ball should be re-

moved until the end of the dance.

Plans for second semester rush
week were also adopted. Rush
week_will be from February 12 to
14, according to M. W. Dietz, C43,
Bi Lambda Phi, publicity director.

first in a series. This entertainment
is under the sponsorship of WSGA
executive committee.

Dancing, cards, bingo, and games
are being planned by the commit-
tee. Punch and cookies will alsobe
served:

“In this small way, Pitt women
can do one more thing for national
defense. College women all over the
country are holding just such par-
ties ‘for the men in the service,”
said Jean Brink, C42, president of
WSGA.

Representatives of each of the

classes will receive invitations to
this initial get-together from the
executive committee, she added.

During the last war, university
women entertained soldiers station-
ed in and around Pitt.

Tomorrow night, forty Pitt wom-
en will be guests at a party» being
planned in their honor by the men
at Logan Armory. The dance will
take place at the Frick Training
school, and will feature Rodger
Martin and his orchestra. The
dance will run from 9:30 to 11:30

“The Women” is a satirical, hu-
morous play about the Park ave-
nue women of America and has
had a long Broadway run in addi-
tion to being played by many road
companies. A movie version also
has been made.

Heywood Broun assailed the play
when it first appeared, as a “crime
against the. spirit” and claimed
that it degraded the human race.
The enthusiasm with which audi-
ences took the play in its true per-
spective-that of a comedy of the
manners and affections of women
which no man really ever sees-—is
expected to be duplicated when the
show is performed here, Whitehill
stated.

As the author of the play, Claire
Booth, says, “The Women are ad-
vocates of the hackneyed, devot-

.-«,

tees of the wisecraclr, and priest- ' p 4
_esses.of the anal."  r p  l
