MAYORAL ELECTION

More
candidates
join race

Gwenn Barney
Assistant News Editor

In the aftermath of Mayor Luke Ra-
venstahl’s decision to withdraw his
election bid for the mayorship, sev-
eral potential candidates expressed
interest in entering the race.

Yesterday, City Council President
Darlene Harris said she will enter the
race and started passing around her
petition to run..To run for mayor in
Pittsburgh’s democratic primaries, an
individual must collect 250 signatures
from registered and enrolled mem-
bers of the Democratic party who are
also residents of the city by March 12.
Harris expressed conﬁdence that she
could procure the necessary signa-
tures intime. .

“I’ve worked with ﬁve mayors. I
feel conﬁdent that I would be able to
lead this city,” Harris said.

Former Pennsylvania State Au-

ditor General jack Wagner also ‘

expressed interest in running for
mayor in a statement he released on
Saturday. He, too, began collecting
signatures on a petition. Last 'I‘ues—

_ day, Wagner told the Pittsburgh -

Tribune—Review that he was con-
sidering running as an independent
in the general election, rather than
entering the primary, but his plans
might have changed.

“I am now looking at rtmning in
the primary,” he stated on Saturday.

Several other individuals are ru-
mored to have interest in running, but
no other pe1:itions are yet circulating.

City Councilman Bill Peduto and
City Controller Michael Lamb both
ﬁled their petitions and launched
their campaigns for mayor prior to
Ravenstahl’s armouncement. I

MAYORAL ELECTION T

Peduto sees opening in race after Ravenstahl’s exit

Natalie Daher
Staff Writer

When Mayor Luke Ravenstahl de-
clared he was dropping his bid for
re-election on March 1, grins,ﬁst
pumps and spirited exclamations
warmly welcomed his armouncement
in the blue-and—gold campaign ofﬁce
of City Councilman Bill Peduto as the
mayoral candidate’s ﬁeld organizers
huddled before a projection of the
press conference. T

Each glass window of Peduto’s
campaign ofﬁce —— a converted ap-
pliance store situated on the corner
ofPenn and Highland avenues in East
Liberty — is plastered with “People
for Peduto” signs and banners, visible

to passersby. The signs are meant to

Career Fair

auract attention to Peduto’s quest for
the mayor’s seat. Peduto launched

his campaign for mayor on Dec. 13,"
a move that conﬁrmed he would step '

down from his current position rep-
resenting Pitt‘sburgh’s eighth district
on city council, a position he has held
for 11 years. The eighth district in-
cludes the Oakland, Shadyside, Squir-
rel Hill, Point Breeze, Bloomﬁeld and
Friendship neighborhoods’. A few

' days after his declaration to run for

mayor, Peduto said that he was ready
to tackle the tasks of the mayorship
after serving for more thana decade
on city council. To reach this preci-

pice of city politics, Peduto has put _

together a campaign platform based
on modernizing the city.
In Pittsburgh, where a Democrat-

ic mayor has occupied ofﬁce for the .

past 80 years, the primaries on May

21 are .the major contentious battle-

for the mayoral seat. With the com-
petition slightly easedbyRavenstahl’s
withdrawal, Peduto currently faces

only City Controller Michael Lamb ,

for the coveted Democratic candi-
date position in general elections this
fall, though several other potential
candidates, including City Council
President Darlene Harris and former

Pennsylvania State Auditor General -

Jack Wagner, have expressed inter-
est in joining the race in recent days.
The road toward the mayorship

for Peduto rests on -a combination‘

of hard work contributed by a team
of supporters and an elaborate cam-
paign platform associated with his

goal of modernization.

Support system _

Earlier on the morning of Raven-
stahl’s armouncement, Allegheny
County Executive Rich Fitzgerald
and State Representative Ed Gainey,
D-Allegheny, spoke to the media on a

blustery Penn Avenue, just down the
street from Peduto’s office. Flurries
stuck to the knee-length pea coats
and pin-striped pants of media mem-
bers as they pushed for the scoop on
Ravenstahl’s recent absences.

“I think he’s in a good position,”
Fitzgerald said, regarding Peduto’s
campaign, prior even to Ravenstahl’s
announcement that he was dropping

his bid for re-election.

According to Grant Gittlen, ﬁeld and politi-
cal directorforthe Peduto campaign, Fitzgerald
is a key Peduto supporter in the race. Gittlen
said that recruiting elected officials to publicly
support his candidate will build “legitimacy”
for the campaign. For instance, Lamb was ex-
pected to hold a majority in Pittsburgh’s South
Hills neighborhoods, but Peduto has managed
to bring Council members Natalia Rudiak and
Bruce Kraus, who both represent South Hills

neighborhoods, on board with his campaign.

“In an area that’s supposed to be [Lamb’s]
base, we have mostly elected oﬂicial'support,”
Gittlen said. “When we go out to events, they’re
there withus asvalidators, and they also tell us
about events and bring on people that maybe
Bill just can’t get to.”

Behind every campaign is a core group of
tireless workers, and some Pitt students and
graduates have put their weightbehind Peduto,
who formerly served in a city council district
that includes part of the University’s upper
campus and North Oakland.

Nate Lemer,a 2012 Pitt graduate, alongside
the other Peduto campaign ﬁeld organizers,
occupies a small, trapezoidal table in Peduto’s
campaign office with a name tag Scotch-taped
to the front. Each organizer is responsible for a
number of the 88 neighborhoods in the Greater
Pittsburgh Area.

Everyone arrives on the job by 9 a.m. for
at least a 12-hour shift. In the morning, the

ers regarding new supporters or volunteers
and calls from the previous day. After that,
they begin to prepare for a day of recruiting as
they assemble walk packets containing ﬂyers

weekday, the organizers typically attend events
including committee meetings, games of bingo
or ﬁsh fries in order to spread the word about

timate level. He noted that many ofthe day-to-

day tasks that affect their daily lives fall under
the umbrella of the mayor’s responsibilities.

“This isn’t as sexy as the Obama campaign,
but it’s still relevant to them because this is
their city that they live in for four years, at the
very least,” Lerner said. “[And] many of them
stay here.” 

Campaign promises
If elected to lead the city, Peduto said he

' would handle matters differently than the cur-

rent mayor. ' _ - 5
_ In what Obama dubbed “Snowmageddon”
when the storm slammed Pittsburghin Febru-
ary 2010, a wintry mix left the roads of the
city unnavigable for days. Even though some
Pitt students rejoiced over the snow days that
succeeded Super Bowl Sunday that year, this
' monstrous storm buriedmounds of money.

beneath its mountains of ﬂurries.

Managerial tasks such as plowing the city’s
roads and maintaining the cash ﬂow of its busi-
nesses largely fall into the hands of the mayor
in the event of winter emergencies. During the
storm, however, Ravenstahl was out of ofﬁce
for the weekend skiing at Seven Springs. His

executive decision to allow the precipitation

to accumulate before sweeping the streets led

tothe temporary shutdown of businesses in -

' addition to the close of the University that year.

-_

According to Marissa Doyle, communica-
tions specialist in the mayor’s oﬁice, the city
handled the blizzard to the best of its ability.

“While the mayor was out of the office, he
was in constant contact with chiefs and direc-
tors of the city and was able to oversee and
properly address the storm,” she said.

Pittsburgh Public Works Director Rob Kac-
zorowski said the unpredictability of the storm
was treacherous, and that his crews worked
around the clock to clear the roads.

“We weren’t equipped,” he said. “There was
no plan in place at the time to handle a snow
emergency like that.” ‘

Peduto said he would have handled the
emergency differently ifhe were in office. In the
future, he plans to emphasize the use of technol-
ogy as”a way to clear the streets of Pittsburgh
when snowfall interrupts normal activity. For

example, he advocates the installation ofGPS 2
systems in plow trucks that will “create a new

sense of accountability and transparency” in

_ such protocol situations. I

MTORJAQ.

   

When I graduate from Pitt this
April, I will owe a combined total
of $53,638 in subsidized and un-
subsidized Stafford, Parent Plus
and private loans, not counting
interest.

How-much" do you owe?

Rude as it might seem, this is a
profoundly important question.
Student debt is unquestionably one
of the greatest challenges facing
our generation. As we speak, Katie
Couric’s show, “Katie,” is seeking
interviewees for a student-debt
special featuring responses to the
query: “Are school loans ruining
your life?” Scholars such as Carn-

   

jokes are dark. “Faking my own
death seems like the most reason-
able, legitimate, sane and intelli-
gent thing to do when faced with
the amount of loan debt I am cur-
rently in,” says a Facebook post by
2012 Pitt graduate Sam Keppen-
stein, who says her loan amount is

, “at least three times” the indebted-

ness rate of the $33,662 average
amount listed on Pitt’s College
Board page. She’s kidding about
faking her death, but many student
debtors are serious when we go
on to matter-of-factly discuss the
pros and cons of selling our eggs
— or, to be more politically cor-

 
  
  

almost anybody I knew, with little
to no hope of ever emerging.
Partly, it’s because talking
about student debt means talking
about class. The fact is, a student
with tens of thousands of dollars
in debt isn’t just going to be,,poorer
than her" classmate with no debt
for a good while after she gradu-
ates; she was likely poorer to start
out with. This doesn’t hold true in
all cases — some people without
means avoid loans because they
received merit—based scholarships,
and some people have parents who
could afford to pay their college
tuition but choose not to. But over-
all, the discussion about student
debt is permeated by awkward-
ness about class, from‘. the defen-
siveness of the kids with a lot of

.’ instead of feelingiguiity aboutthe debt

. we’ve accumulated in pursuit of; the v
American . Dream, we need to have .an
honest conversation about the skyrocketing

price of education  .

egie Mello n’s Jeffrey Williams_ com-
pared theexcess of student—loan
debt to colonial-era indentured
servitude,‘ where those in bondage
pledge years of their ownlabor,
handing over a signiﬁcantchunk
of their wages to their debtors
in exchange for the promise of a
brighter ﬁxture in the New World.

In the past few years, graduates
have defaulted on $67 billion worth

to get their money back, denying

transcripts to alumni in default_ ‘

andhiring professional collectors
to hound those who haven’t paid.

Chances are very good that
someone reading this is going
to end up in default themselves.

* Chances are even better that nearly

everyone readingthis has at least
one friend who recently graduated
from college and now gets upwards
of 10 calls a day from collection
agencies — even though those

_ offederal student loans, and lend- 
;{ ers are taking harsher measures

rect, “donating” them in exchange
for time—and.-trouble compensa-
tion that can rangefrom $5,000
to $10,000. '

Moreover, when we  about
student debt", we tend to be vague.
Most of us say we have “a lot of
loans,” but it’s rarely clear what
that means —— anything from
$20,000 to -$100,000 can be
someone’s idea of “a lot of loans.”

Partly, that’s because the num-
bers can be hard to keep track of
 at the ‘end of the day, most of
us are going to pay far more than
we originally borrowed because on
some payment plans, the ‘interest
on your loan can end up exceeding
the ‘principal. Before I looked up
Pitt’s statistics and surveyed my
peers, I was afraid to even think
about my student loan amount. I
was afraid I would discover it was
far, far more than is normal and
that I would ﬁnd myself drowning
in debt to an extent far greater than

loans, to the guilt of the kids who

were well-off enough to pay as they
went.

But most of all, I think, we avoid
talking numbers with regard to our
student debt because we feel guilty
and foolish. We worry that we are
the idiot kids that old people in on-
line comment sections rant about,
stupidly getﬁng degrees we can’t
-afford in subjects that won’t make
us any money because we some-
how believed that we were just too
special to go to community college
or go for an accounting degree.

But I don’t think that’s fair. I
think many of us have done exactly
what we were told we should. In
high school, I remember college
prep pamphlets saying that it was
OK to take out lots of student loans,
because people take out loans for

things like cars and homes that
don’t last as long — or contribute

as much to your life satisfaction and earn-
ing potential — as a college degree should.
And despite the pain and diﬁiculty of the
recession, a recent analysis of federal data
shows that still holds true. Bachelor’s degree
holders are still 4 percent more likely to be

employed than assOciate’s degree holders ’

and 9 percent more likely to be employed
than those with only high school diplomas,
and graduates of four—year institutions have
seen their wages drop at half the rate of
those without bachelor’s degrees.

I also question the wisdom that we should
all get high—paying dégrees to justify our

college education. First of all, not everyone
can or should be an investment banker. Most
of the people we are taught to_look up to
throughout history — with the exception
of scientists and politicians — aren’t people
who chose high—paying careers. They’re ac-
tivists and writers, peoplewho made the

world a better place and often went broke '

doing it.

We need teachers, social workers, jour-
nalists, historians and —— yes, God forbid
—— artists. College students who rack up lots
of debt pursuing “soft” liberal—arts degrees
aren’t just studying what they love — they’re
studying what they are good at. I’m not get-
ting a writing degree because I selﬁshly put

_ my own enjoyment of storytelling ahead of

the tax revenue I could have contributed
to societynif I had gone into insurance; I’m
getting a writing degree because I think the
world needs a good writer more than it needs A
a bad insurance agent — and believe me, I
would be a terrible insurance agent. 

Instead of feeling guilty about the debt
we’ve accumulated in pursuit ofthe'Ameri—
can Dream, we need to havean honest con-
versation about the skyrocketing price of
education, predatory lending and the other
issues surrounding the student—debt cri-
sis. But ﬁrst, we need to be willing to talk
numbers. ' -

These are the amounts people (all Pitt
students, unless otherwise_indicated) con-
fessed to me that they owe: $36,000 for

9

four years with a nonﬁction writing major;
$50,000 for four years of undergrad and
one year at the school of education; $48,000
for undergrad and a degree from the School
of Public Health; $66,000 for undergradu-
ate alone; $11,000 for three years of room
and board for a student with a full—tuition

scholarship; $11,000 for the first year before '

taking a break to save up; $100,000 for ﬁve
years in the engineering program; $35,000

still owed by a Penn State graduate who '

graduated twelve years ago; $53,000 for a
Pitt News columnist about to graduate into a
world where “English major” is a punch line.

Potlucks offer time for social relaxation,culina  sharing

Pat Mallee
Copy Chief

I’m sick of winter. The dreary, bleak days
of February thoroughly got on my nerves,
and with the stress of midterms wearing
me down, it’s safe to say that I will be run-
ning home for spring break at the end of
this week. _

But before 1 bolt of out Oakland and
recharge by lying next to a heater and pre-
tending I’m in Fiji for an entire week, I took
the time to get some friends together for a
potluck dinner.

For those who’ve never been to one, a
potluck is a.big dinner party at which ev-

eryone brings a large dish to share with all
those in attendance.

A potluck is a great way to catch up with
friends because it gets everyone involved to
pause their hectic lives and meet up some-
where that isn’t a nasty frat basement that
reeks of body odor and stale beer. You and
your friends get to spend quality time hang-
ing out, chatting, watching a movie — what-
ever your giddy hearts desire.

And with an assortment of delicious food
spread out for your collective enjoyment,

what more could you need to make for a i
‘ great get—together‘? .

a If I’ve got you interested in throwing
your own potluck, you’re going to need to

Foods like macaroni and cheese and fried chicken make for nood potluck dishes. MCT Campus

- Potlucks call for comfort food — simple,
delicious dishes that just plain make you feel
good while eating them. Just thinking about
these foods can make anyone hungry —
mac and cheese, fried chicken, rustic pasta
dishes and let’s not forget the cheesevcakpe
brownies you’ve been avoiding during your
winter hibernation without exercise.
Some people like togo all— out and create
detailed, themedpotlucks at which everyone
must contribute a_dish that ﬁts the theme.

Call me lazy, or call me a man who is‘

glad to have never spent time on Pinter-
est — either way I think this can be a bit
too complicated for the average friendly
gathering, though some might ﬁnd it an
interesting twist.

Also, I like to see the variety of things
that people choose to bring when uncon-
strained by a theme, as it says a lot about
their personality and their tastes in food.

For example, I love rich, ﬂavorful Italian
cooking, and so I chose to contribute my
favorite bruschetta (see last month’s col-
umn for a quick run-down on how to make
it) to my potluck. The plate was empty in
no time at all. One of my friends brought

 

spicy friedrice with peppers and corn. An-

other brought a Spanish frittata made with . ,

potatoes and onions. Everyonebrought a
different set of ﬂavors to grace the palates
of ourfriends. i " i ’ - " '

But not everyone has to contribute some— I

thing as complex as these. Ifyou’re short on
time or not the best cook, put yourself on
salad duty or offer to provide the drinks. '

If you love to bake,'take on dessert by
making your favorite cookies, brownies or
cupcakes.

Whatever you choose to make, the idea is
that if everyone splits up the task of cooking,

there is less stress on the group as a whole-

And once everyone gathers together to share
each other’s creations, the relaxation and
social interaction should relieve much of
the stress that everyone feels throughout
the school year.

- If you’re interested in throwing a potluck
but still can’t ﬁgure out what you’d like to
make, I’ve given the recipe for a cheesy veg-
etable pasta dish that my mom frequently
makes at home. And nothing says comfort
food quite like mom’s home cooking. I

“A colleague of mine from business

may gawk at the price tag — especially
students strapped for cash — Aswegen

hopes that the message behind the shoes

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Pitt loses 36th-
straight, last
Big East game

Dave Uhrmacher
Staff Wrz'ter

The streak stops here. The end of the Pitt

0 women’s basketball team’s time in the Big East

conference has brought an end to the Panthers’
36-game losing streak in regular-season confer-
ence play. _ i‘

- The school’s move to the Atlantic Coast Con-

. ference at the end of this academic year will

halt the regular—season conference record, but
the losing streak against Big East ‘opponents
marches to inﬁnity-and beyond.

On a night when Pitt (9-20, 0-16 Big East)
had three players record double ﬁgures, it was
not enough for the Panthers to overcome coach
C. Vivian Stringer’s Rutgers squad, as the Pan-_
thers lost 65-44 at the Rutgers Athletic Center

in Piscataway, NJ. The Scarlet Knights’ (16-13, _ A

7-9 Big East) victory is credited heavily to their
offensive efficiency: They managed to shoot 56.5
percent from the ﬁeld.

The loss marks the second-straight season

_ inwhich Pitt failed to record avictory in the Big

East, with its last regular-season conferencevic-

‘ tory coming all the way back on Feb. 15, 2011,
when the Panthers took down the Providence

Friars 60-57 in overtime at the Petersen Events
Center. ;
The Panthers will leave behind the historic
36-game losing streak, but the move to the ACC
will prevent Pitt from being cemented into the
Big East record books forever. Providence holds
the record for the longest conference losing

_ streak in Big East history, losing 39 in a row

from 2003-2006.
As an era came to an end, the actual gameplay

_ matched the problems that have plagued Pitt
I since the losing streak began.

Though leading scorer Brianna Kiesel re-

' corded a team-high 14 points forthe Panthers,

she shot 4-for-15 from the ﬁeld. The team made
just 16 of the 50 shots they attempted, while
players coming off the bench managed to record
just four points. Redshiitfreshman guard Loliya
Briggs and junior guard Marquel Davis were the
othertwo Panthers in double ﬁgures, with 11 and
10 points, respectively. ‘
Free-throwwoesja common themefor b0
the men’s and women’s basketball teams, were
again problematic for Pitt on Monday night The
Panthers stepped to the line 18 times against

' Rutgers but managed to convert only-I halfof
B those chances.  ‘

The winless Panthers have locked up the
lowest seed in the Big East Tournament, which
begins Friday. Pitt will begin with a matchlip
against the 10th-seeded Marquette Golden
Eagles. Tip-off is set for 6 p.m. on Friday from
the XL Center in Hartford, Conn. I i

" Nate Barnes
-Senior Staff Writer

After an impressive start to the season, the
Pitt baseball team'couldn’t ﬁnd its offensive
strength as it did in the ﬁrst two series.

The Panthers suffered three consecu-
tive losses over the weekend, ‘playing in the
Charleston Crab House Shootout in Charles-
ton, S.C. The defeats came at the hands of The
Citadel, University of North Carolina—Ashe-
ville and Virginia Commonwealth University,
dropping Pitt’s record to 5-4 so far this season.

“It was a rough weekend,” junior starter
Ethan Mildren said. “We pitched the ball fairly
well [but] pretty much shot ourselves in the
foot a couple times with walks and getting
guys off the ﬁeld. Offensively, we just couldn’t
get the bats going.”

The Citadel 8, Pitt 0 .

The Citadel, The Military College of South
Carolina, shut Pitt out on the scoreboard Fri-
day to take home an 8-0 victory. After starting
two quality games as the staff’s ace, Mildren
gave up six runs in just ﬁve innings pitched
—.each his highest and lowest output of the
season, respectively.

“I felt good, I just didn’t have my best stuff.
I got ahead of myselfa little bit with rushing,
a couple of mechanics things, and they were
hitting the ball. Mostly they wherehitting fast-
balls and balls were being left up,” Mildren
said. “We got ourselves in jams and couldn’t
get off the ﬁeld with two ou .” ' '

Pitt had close nests gainst NC-Asheviiie and

Panthers drop three games over weekend

Apart from pitching, Pitt head coach Joe
Jordano pointed out that The Citadel picked
up big hits at the right times — especially as

part of a ﬁve—run sixth inning -— and the kind A

of crucial hits Pitt never found. I

“It was a disappointing loss tonight,”Jor-
dano said in a press release. “I thought we had
some opportunities to score early and we did
not get the big hit.”

A The most glaring example of this inability
came in the top of the ﬁfth inning, when Pitt
senior Evan Oswald led off the inning with
a double and sophomore Eric Hess walked.
After a double—steal, Pitt had two runners in
scoring position with only one out but was
unable to bring anyone home. .

“The Citadel is 51 very good team and they
did a great job of getting hits in RBI situations.
Their starter pitched well and got some big
outs when he needed them,”]ordano said.

UNC-Asheville 5, Pitt4 A ,
Saturday, Pitt found itself with the best

« chance to win a game during its time in the

Palmetto State, but couldn’t ﬁnish the job
after battling back multiple times to tie the
contest against UNC-Asheville. Pitt tied the
game at 1-1, 2-2 and 4-4, with the ﬁnal tie re-
quiring the teams to play an extra inning. Pitt
sophomore Elvin Soto played a huge role in
keeping Pitt in the game with a home run in
the top of the seventh and an RBI single that
sent Steven Shelinsky Jr. home in the eighth
to cut the deﬁcit to 4-3. Evan Oswald scored

in the ninth on a wild pitch to send the game

Pitt remained scoreless in the top of the
tenth and the Bulldogs won when Toddjoyner
scored on awild pitch from the hand of Tan-
ner Wilt. In the eyes ofjordano, the Panthers
showed little ability to win Saturday with the
way they played, despite going into an extra
inning. '4 _

“Quite frankly, we did not do anything
to win this game today,” Jordano said. “We
did not follow our offensive philosophy at
all, and it hurt. We gave away an incredible
amount of at-bats and did not make in-game
adjustments.”

VCU 6, Pitt4 f .

In the ﬁnal game of Pitt’s visit to Riley Park,
home of the minor-league Charleston River-
Dogs, the Panthers lost once again, this time
to the undefeated VCU Rams (8-0). Sunday’s
matchup ended in dramatic fashion, with the
Panthers putting together a rally on the back
of a three-run home run from Shelinsky in
the ninth inning.

The rally started with a one-out walk is-
sued to right-ﬁelder Casey Roche, and Dylan
Wolsonovich followed with anotherfree pass
from VCU starter Billy Creighton. The run-
ners moved to second andthird on a wild
pitch, but Creighton recovered to record his
11th strikeout of the game. Then, Shelinsky
stepped to the plate and smashed one over
the center—ﬁeld fence.

A GRAlN (BF SAIJL

A fun, exciting solution to bring an end to flopping in basketball

Isaac Saul.
Senior Staﬂ Wrz'ter

That’s it! I’ve got it!

Call ESPN. Press pause on your TiVo.
Get David Stern on the phone. I ﬁgured
it out. V
From the shiny hardwood floors of
the NBA to the elementary school play-
grounds, I found the solution to ﬂoppers
all over the world. I

Whether it’s Manu Ginobili and Chris
Paul playing for Academy Awards or that

' . four-eyed noodle in your gym class, flop-

pers have been sucking fun from the game
forever.

So what’s the solution? The NBA has
already tried their old, tired ways.

First, they deﬁned the flop. “Any physi-
cal act that appears to have been intended
to cause the referees to call a foul on an-

other player. The primary factor in deter— '

mining whether a player committed a flop
is whether his physical reaction to contact
with another play is inconsistent with
what would reasonably be expected given
the force or direction of the contact.”
Then, they warned the league’s play-
ers that “repeat offenders” could face
ﬁnes starting at $5,000 and increasing
in $5,000 dollar increments until they

QFROM PAGE 8

“We’ve scored six runs inan inningbefore,
so anything is really possible,” Roche said.
“You’ve just gotta try to get on base and get
something going.”

The moonshot to dead center field chased
Creighton from the game, and closer Matt
Lees then took the hill for the Rams. Outﬁelder
Boo Vazquez drew a walk from Lees and Hess
then doubled into right ﬁeld. Hess’ play turned
out to be the ﬁnal one of the game, as Vazquez
was thrown out at home plate while attempt-
ing to score. _ ‘

Of all the weekend games, it seemed Jor-

’ dan_o responded most positively to Sunday’s

contest. Pitt led the Rams early Sunday, when
Stephen Vranka scored on a passed ball in the
fourth inning.

“Very tough game today,” Jordano said.
“We battled back and had the winning run at
the plate in the ninth. We have a lot of work
to do, but we played hard to the ﬁnal out.”

The Panthers should useothe three—game
loss as a learning toolafter a solid start to the
2013 season.

“[This weekend’s] a big learning point for
our team. We saw areas that we need improve-
ment on and even the things that we did [well] ,
just keep doing them and work on the things
that we've been executing,” Mildren said. “I
think everybody was kind of up high and just
thought we were going to go out there and win,
and then we didn’t stick to our approach.” I

hit $30,000. Psh. That’s like telling me
plagiarism isn’t allowed, but if I’m caught
I’ll get a warning first, then a $1 ﬁne, and
then increasing increments of dollar ﬁnes
until I’m paying $6 every time I’m caught
plagiarizing. Even if that plagiarism earns
me a Pulitzer Prize.

Do you know how much LeBronJames
— one of the NBA’s biggest floppers — will
make this season? About $17.45 million.
That’s $47,808 a day. The $5,000 ﬁne
James would get for his second offense
(they’re warning cheaters now) is .0002
percent of his salary this year. You might
as well just tell him he can’t have Vitamin
Water (his favorite drink) for a day.

As Blake Griffin put it, “you’re telling
me if it’s Game 7 of the NBA Finals and a
guy has a chance to make a play, he’s going
to be like, ‘Well do,I want this $10,000 or
do I want a championship?’ Do you know
what I mean?”

Yes Blake, I know what you mean: You’d
flop in an instant if it meant a victory. .

. So, I’m going to goout a limb here and
say r_eaching into an NBA player’s pocket
isn’t the solution.

But don’t worry, I’ve got a better idea.
Let’s toss them into a penalty box.

' Imagine this: Kevin Durant comes down
the court, crosses over one Miami Heat
defender and drives to the rack. James

SCHENLPZY PLAZA

OPA GYROS

EYMOU    

jumps in front, sets his feet and throws
his arms in the air as he ﬁails backward
and Durant blows by him without making
contact on his way to an easy bucket.
Then — that moment we all hate to
see -— the ref blows his whistle. We’re
sitting at home, watching the replay that
clearly shows LeBron’s flop. Our rage is
uncontrollable. We can’t believe‘ that id-

-iot missed the call. He must be blind. _Or

drunk. Or stupid.

But wait! This is my league, so instead
of giving the Heat possession and tak-
ing away LeBron’s appetizer that night at
Mjiami’s most expensive restaurant, the
ref strolls over to the monitors to review
the charge as if it were a buzzer-beater.

There, he sees LeBron go Daniel Day-
Lewis. He watches himself fall for the
lowly ploy. Mr. Zebra turns to the court,
blows his whistle, waves his arms in the
air and opens a 5-foot-by-5—foot plexiglass
box like they have in the NHL. The crowd

_ goes wild». It’s a 2-minute ﬂopping major

and boom: the NBA power playis born.
Now, the flop has some repercussions.
All of a sudden, the Oklahoma City,Thun—
der are playing man-up with one of the
best fast-break offenses in the world, and
the next two minutes are riddled with
alley-oops and doub1e—teams and three-
point ﬁeld goals as James’ flop turns into

' an embarrassing 10-0 two-minute run for,

the opposing team. That is justice.
Ah, just imagining the faces of Gino-
bili, Paul, Grifﬁn and Shane Battier sitting

‘behind that plexiglass box brings a smile

to my face.

Shoot, we could take it a step further:
Let’s give NBA coaches red ﬂags like they I
have in the NFL so they can actually chal-
lenge foul calls. How fun would that be?

Ginobili drives inside, throws the ball
over the backboard, tosses his body back
like he just took a punch from Mike Tyson,
letsout a Serena Wi1liams—esque scream
and entices the ref to blow his whistle.
He’s walking to the line for his free throws
when the opposing coach slides the red
ﬂag to his feet at the line. Ginobili freezes
when he sees the challenge flag. The refs
go to the monitors, “ﬂop-cam” comes on
the big board hanging over the court and hi
the whole world sees Ginobili’s flop live.
And then he has to go sit in the penalty
box.

See, Mr. Stern? This commissioner
stuff isn’t that hard. We’re talking about
professional athletes. They care about
two things: winning and their ego. How
about we start attacking those things when
we want to punishthem, instead of their
wallets, which are ﬁlled with millions. 3
