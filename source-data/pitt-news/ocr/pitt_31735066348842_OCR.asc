 Aid Bill Asks$58 Mill. for Pitt R9P- Pushes 5% C”’b”°k5
    i For Sfafe—reIafed Schools

BY GENE GRABOWSKI
A bill that would, provide Pitt
with 3558.238 million‘ in state funds
was introduced yesterday in the

Pennsylvania Senate by the appro- .

priations committee.
N It is the first piece of legislation
Tnfficially proposed for Pitt’s
budget. The bill," if passed, would
give Pitt about $4 million less than
its original request for $62 million
in state funds,‘but Russ Arnold,
head of the University’s depart-
ment of government relations, said
he expected the proposed ﬁgure.
“The amount comes as no
surprise to me,” Arnold, “though
of course we’d hoped for a higher
ﬁgure.” "
Arnold, who was in Harrisburg
when the bill was brought to the
floor, said it was impossible to

predict when the allocation would 4

be voted on.

Standards, In

BY JAN LLOYD

‘" ' ‘Landlords may be required to
maintain a minimum standard_ of
maintenance and habitability on"
their property if a bill introduced
yesterday into the Pennsylvania
State Legislature is passed. ’

The bill, sponsored by Repres-
entative James A. Romanelli and
drawn up- with the help ,of‘ the
Pennsylvania Legal Services Inc.,
will set up certain guidelines
rented properties must meet. .

 ,_ Speciﬁc requirements will be

C3‘-‘made concerning locks and security

systems, cold and hot water,-

building temperature and trash

receptacles. Any repairs necessary

on the property to make it meet

these requirements must be made
\ promptly by the landlord.

“We’re trying to create decent, I

livable housing for everyone in
Pennsylvania,” Romanelli said.

“All tenants deserve a fair deal.” ,

Representative Roman . lli point-
ed out that the idea is simply that a
landlord, ‘by putting up a residence
for rent, would be “warranting”

The faculty unionization earings continue this week, with the
debate ‘continuing the Pennsylvania State Education Association

Assistant ‘Vice Chancellor of
Planning and Budget James
Hunter said it was “anybody’s
guess” on the time or
likelihood of the bill’s passage.

“The issue involves a mixture of
the taxation question along with
appropriations,” said Hunter.
“The ﬁnal decision on the Pitt

budget-may not come for a long"

while--probably after July I.’’
Hunter explained that the
allocation of "funds to a state-
related school such as Pitt was a
“non-preferred” item. The state

the V

assembly sets non-preferred items
on its agenda aside until preferred
items such as welfare and highway
budgets are approved.

Hunter didn’t say what Pitt’s
budget planners would do if the
legislature fails to act on the

appropriations bill until after July »

1, but noted they would try to
“make things ﬁt” into the current
budget including the proposed aid
package. ‘

“Until the bill is voted on,”.
Hunter concluded, “nothing much
can be done.”. -

Resident pleas ignored

Pm Labeled Poor

BY GENE GRABOWSKI‘ ‘

Two residents of the University-' A

owned Craig-Forbes apartments
charged a Pitt adminstrator yester-
day with poor response to tenant
demands for changes in leasing
terms. ‘

Ken Sullivan and Terry Glazer,
Pitt graduate students, ‘said that
University Treasurer David Smith

has ignored the petition served on .

him last Thursday that asked that
students in the building be allowed
to sign leases that hold them liable
for apartments for less than a year.‘

Sullivan explained that all
residents of the Forbes-Craig
complex must be Pitt grad
students, but they must sign leases
lasting for at least a year. The
petition recommended this rule be
changed for students who leave Pitt

- after the end of school terms.

“Because the University oper-
ates the building as a student
service,” Sullivan said, “the rent
schedule should be based on the
school year. As it stands now,
residents must seek replacement
tenants to ﬁnish paying on their
leases. Usually,.they get stuck for
the’ rent after leaving their
apartments. ’ ’ ’

The petition, Glazer said, was
signed by 52 of the 59 residents in
Forbes-Craig. '

The University can’t afford to
allow students to sign leases for
less than a year -at a time,
according to Smith. The treasurer
agreed that the apartments were

I provided as a service to grad

students, but noted that the service
was a “self-supporting” one.

“If we allowed students to leave
the building at the end of any term
without responsibility for ﬁnding
replacements,” said Smith, “we’d
end up with a- lot of /" empty
apartments.” ¥ ' ' ‘

Smith added that the cost of
maintaining empty apartments
would probably be absorbed by Pitt
students. .

“We offer the students the same
kind of leasing arrangement as any
other companies in the area,”_ he
said, “If students want to sublet
their apartments, they can ﬁnd

someone on the waiting list to take
their place.”

Sullivan said students are aware
of their right‘to sublet, but added
that it’s often -difﬁcult to ﬁnd a
replacement during certain months
of the year.

“There’s always the risk that no

one will sublet,” said Sullivan, _

“and we’re responsible for paying
rent on an empty apartment while
searching for subletters.”
“Students must notify Pitt three
months in advance before they
leave an-apartment,” said Glazer,
“and there’s,never any guarantee
they’ll find a new apartment.”
‘Students who terminate their
leases before the one-year contract

-is'up must forfeit a security deposit

equal to one month’s rent, in

addition to payment of a $25 fee.

Agéithe only thing doctors seem

nable to cure is the cancer-like
growth of malpractice insurance
rates.

gainst law-suits skyrocket to

He said the Allegheny County

When doctors in many other
large cities, among them several in
Pennsylvania, are resorting to
slowdowns and walkouts as the
only means to combat the new
Varmint that is rapidly gnawing
away at their ﬁnances, how could
Pittsburgh be headed for anything
but a similar fate? ‘ -

The first reason--doctors in
Pittsburgh are, at the present time,
simply not being hit as hard as
those in many other cities.
Malpractice insurance, handled
mainly by the Argonaut Company
of California, is at least still
available to Pittsburgh doctors.

Even though there have been
increases in premiums locally, they
still do not compare to the
oppressive rates in cities where

- doctors have chosen to go on strike.

For example, Atwell said the
malpractice insurance premium for
himselfand his partner combined
was $6,000’ for the past twelve
months, and is expected to rise to
almost $20,000 per year in October.

“But if I were a surgeon in
Philadelphia, I could be paying
$40,000 or $50,000, especially if I
was a young guy,” Atwell pointed
out. '

 

/»‘

Therefore, even ‘though prem- 1'

iums in Pittsburgh are headed for
dangerously high increases, the
hope is that the legislators will act
quickly to change the worsening
situation in areas where doctors
have already gone on strike, and
just as quickly to avert further
walkouts.

“Other cities are going on strike
to try to get the state legislatures to
try to correct the malpractice
insurance situation,” explained
Atwell. “They are going on strike
purely for that reason.”

What measures is it hoped the
governing bodies of the states will
take to keep exorbitant malpractice

-insurance rates from forcing

doctors to stay at home?

Among the most important,
Atwell believed, was to impose a
statute of limitations for malprac-
tice suits. At the present, there
is none at all._

“I think a statute of limitations

should be set for a reasonable

time,” Atwell said. .“Ten or
twenty years afterqan incident,
people will sue, and the insurance
companies must take this into
account when establishing prem-

-iums.”

 

BF..I..., Strike n....I  

The surgeon, and associate
professor of surgery at Pitt’s
Medical School, also felt an
arbitration panel should decide
malpractice cases.

He said a board consisting of

consumers, lawyers, judges, and
unbiased physicians would be more
qualiﬁed to make the judgment
than a jury, “where emotion plays
too great a part.”

Finally, Atwell considered
“obscene” the -contingency fee
basis for which lawyers handle
malpractice cases. Since the
lawyer receives 40% of “all money
awarded to a patient in malpractice
suits, he insisted many of the cases
are “instigated by the attorneys.”

Atwell was convinced the attor-

.ney’s fee should beset at a much

lower level.

Whether or not any of these
reforms are affectuated by the state
legislature, Atwell said he would
not go on strike under any
circumstances. . .

“I am a surgeon because I enjoy
being a surgeon, and nobody in the
world is going to make me stop.”.

“Nobody,” said Atwell, includ-
ing the insurance companies.

Cheerleocling Hopefuls
To Get Second Chance q

BY SUSAN MANNELLA

; In response to controversy over

 the cheerleading tryout proced-

I’ ures, a cheerleading clinic for the

_,_k2\3 women who took part in the

‘ «/ ‘rfpgil tryouts will be held June 28

and 29, according to, cheerleading
advisor Sandra Bullman.

The dispute developed when
none of the six black ‘candidates
was selected by an all-white panel
of judges made up of Bullman and
three male coaches.

Several students later filed
complaints with Vice-Chancellor of
student Affairs Alfred Moye,
alleging the cheerleading program
was being operated like a tight
clique, with no outsiders included.
Cheerleaders denied the charges,
saying they choose squad members
only on the basis of tryout scores.

“We will work with the kids at
the clinic and then we’re going to

;.’J"§‘>gl:;.a.ve some kind of tryout,”
Bullman said. She said she would
not specify what the selection plan
will be until after it is announced at
the clinic.

The procedure will be much the
same as the ‘original tryouts,

Bullman said, although she said it,’

is possible the girls might be given

a choice about how the final
decision will be made.

In early May, Moye took the
complaints to ‘Athletic Director
Casimir Myslinski in an_ effort to
solve the problem. ’

Myslinski proposed that three
black women be added to the squad
but the cheerleaders rejected the
plan, saying only the best-per-
forming candidates should be
placed on the squad.

A second plan was suggested
that would have ‘involved two
squads composed’ of all the
candidates. They would be
assigned to cheer. games according
to their relative ability and
progress. Some of the women also
objected to this planbecause they
said it would cause, too much
competition within the squad.

Athletic department ofﬁcials said
they are confident the squad will be
ready for football season in
September, regardless of the way it
is chosen.

Letters‘ were sent to all the
cheerleading candidates June 9
informing them of the two-day
clinic, and Bullman said their
responses are just starting to come
in. “I think we will have 90 to 100
per cent for the clinic,” she said.

that premises as habitable.

If the property being rented does
not meet the established stan-
dards, the tenant may , withhold
rent‘ until repairs are made, a
measure that could not previously
be taken according to the Landlord-
Tenant Act of 1951. I

Stuart S. Sacks, an attorney for
the Pennsylvania Legal Services
Inc. said the bill was a very fair"
one. ~
“We’re not giving either land-
lords or tenants the advantage,”
Sacks said, “but we’re'trying to
protect their relationship by mak-

ing their bargaining power equal.”

Sacks also pointed out, “The
majority of landlords who act in
good faith will not be affected by

this law. Predictably, only those.

landlords who prey‘on intimidated
tenants will come under scrutiny.
It will not, however, protect tenants
who cause their own problems.”
Morton Lutzker, of the Council to
the House Committee on Business
and Commerce, sees the bill as a
way to improve city housing.
“This bill, by establishing
minimum standards of habitability
for rental properties,” . Lutzker
said, “may stop the spread of
slums in urban areas.”

~ ;.7Ihe austerity bill proposed by State Representative William Shane of
Indiana will do more harm than good for Pemisylvania higher
education. If it is enacted, state universities will be required to cut
3 ‘back their faculties and staffs by ﬁve per cent. This provision alone will
further weaken the already teetering foundations of the state’s

\ education system.

’ I First,theblanketordertocutﬁvepercentoffacultyandstaffatPitt,
?;._Penn State and Temple is given without individual consideration to
'"e_ach,school’s needs and educational responsibilities.
f 4 Second, the bill presents a dangerous threat to the three
universities’ autonomy and degree of self- governance permitted by the
 state. Though the state schools are subject to the ﬁnal decrees of the
1- commonwealth, such a direct and speciﬁc order from Harrisburg on
"how to operate during the funding crisis was never called for. State
legislators must be ever-mindful of the thin line between legislating for

education and regulating it.

A I Third and most obvious, Shane’s proposal is a step in the wrong
direction in the effort to halt the decay of education in society. By
legislating more cuts, the state is tying yet another millstone around

these schools’ necks.

_ As American culture becomes more and more concerned-with the

’ here and now and less interested in planning for the future, higher
education cannot but help lose out. There is no guarantee that colleges
 and universities, unlike secondary schools, will be able to maintain
 their standards of learning. The freedom to pick and choose a
 .Ipost-secondary institution places these schools in a constant and often
‘  wounding competition for students. A money squeeze can spell
- out probable extinction for many schools; various ones have gone this

 route already.

_ Shane’s bill and others like it are symptomatic of the disease in our -
‘that places education at the bottom of a long list of questionable

priorities." This sort of thinking is anti-intellectual in nature, and with

enough fostering will implant a technically-trained, rmnually-oriented
laborforce where there was once the world's greatest fotmtain. of

reasoned thought. ‘

  To keep things in their proper perspective, we must say that Shane’s

‘  not provide for this dramatic decay by itself. His bill will be

, only another failure by one of the state’s lawmakers to reverse the
..l,.trend of continued complacence toward higher education.

Indifference, infringement and insufficient funding. These words

-,:_ay one daybe written in history books to explain the reason why one

~ civilization’s thirst for an educated society suddenly deteriorated to a

mere‘ aftertaste.

Procession of Sacred Cows

BY GEORGE W. DULL

Unlike anything short of the
investiture of the Prince of Wales,
a State funeral, or a papal
procession into the Lateran basil-
ica, the university commencement
adequately demonstrates certain
sociological concepts, stresses and
strains, if you will, class and status,
for sure. In the processional phase
of the commencement we are made
aware of the hierarchy of the cows,
sacred and profane. And this is as
it should be. No one escapes status
although theoretically one can
escape class stratification by
moving up or down. .

The late Pitt Chancellor Edward
Litchfield, was the model of the
chief cow who enters the barn first.
Litchfield, resplendent in his
self-designed medieval attire, al-
most succeeded in impressing his
style on the University ritual so
well that, at least during his time,
one could have described Pitt ritual
as Edwardian L.

At the end of the commencement
procession shufﬂes the lowest
ranking cows. These lowly bovines
are the undergraduates wearing
the pointed sleeves of the bachelor
upon whom a degree will soon be
conferred. Most of them wear
shoes and ‘as they plod along their
feet hurt because they have
become unaccustomed to being
shod, at least properly shod, during
the years they have frisbeed and
concentrated on other important
subjects during their four yearson
campus. The status idea, at this
point in time, is simply that now; as
the moment of truth arrives, if he
or she isn't aware of the pecking
order and how little he or she really
knows then he or she should go to
his or herhome-and spend the -rest
of his or her life makingshoes or
making a home, drink beer and

. watch television.

It is strange how a bill’s affront to the future someday could play

such a tremendous role in it.

Appointeés Defense

It has recently been alleged that

_ my appointment as chairman of the

’. department of Slavic languages

, and literatures at the University of

Pittsburgh was_made in order to

""-phaseout that department. At best

1 such charges are based on ' a
‘misunderstanding of the facts.

 _ Both the appointment, and more

 important, my acceptance of the

  appointment, were founded on

obtaining University support to

strengthen ‘and expand the basic

offerings of the department, and,

in addition, to work toward the

development of a meaningful and

_ ’ exciting interdisciplinary major for

 students interested in Ethnic

_ Studies.

. I would like to take this
 opportunity to outline some of. the
 _primary objectives of the depart-
I , —ment asl see them for the next few
' years.

While the strengths of the
Russian language and literature
, program on both the undergrad-
5., V. uate and graduate levels will be
 emphasized and supported, the
rest of the undergraduate curric-
 ulum will be completely revised so
" ~ -that students may opt for one of
three possible majors. Beginning
in the fall term 1975, students may
‘choose to (I) .begin to_major in
. comparative Slavic languages and
 « literatures, (2) concentrate in the
  already existent Russian language
" V ' and literature program, or (3) opt
for an interdisciplinary major in
-ethnic studies--this will involve a
 certain set of courses in the Slavic
 department plus appropriate
course offerings in other depart-
ments, such as history, music-,
anthropology, art. political science,
etc..; and, where desirable, course
offerings at other colleges in the
Pittsburgh area.

the Slavic Peoples,” “Modern
Polish Literature,” and “Contem-
porary Serbo-Croatian Literature. ’ ’
Over the next few years, beginning
with the winter term 1976, a
number of new courses .in Slavic
literatures and cultures will be

offered. These courses shall
include: “Masterpieces in Slavic
Literatures” (intended' primarily

for beginning students, freshmen
and sophomores), “Slavic Litera-
tures and Society,” “Slavic
Literature‘ and Slavic Humor,”
“Slavic Folklore and Mythology,”
“The Slavic Novel,” and “Slavic
Cultures and Western Civiliza-
tion."

All of these courses will be
taught in English and will be open
to students of Slavic and non-Slavic
background. If and when demands
increase, literature courses may
also be taught in Slavic languages
other than Russian.

Language offerings at the
moment include Russian, Polish,
Serbo-Croatian and Slovak. If
there is enough demand,. faculty
shall be hired to_ teach additional
Slavic languages. Petitions for
such courses may be addressed to

guages and Litera ures, University

In addition to the standard
curriculum, graduate and under-
graduate students shall be strongly
encouraged to participate in
extracurricular activities centering
around the Slavic Club. These
activities will be planned so as to
provide a variety of_ opportunities
for students and members of the
Slavic communities to meet and
share ideas and experiences.

Many of the Slavic Club activities
will be open to the community at
large for just this. purpose. The

Slavic Club shall sponsor guest‘

because they tend to preserve the

tionalization of power and the
elitist control of power. Even the

Karl Marx, acutely aware of

class distinctions, worked little and i

For Watergate involvement

wrote a lot. Marx, the champion of
work and the working class, never
worked in his life except to edit‘ a
couple of newspapers, and this only
briefly, for he was always being
told by government authorities to
get his ragged ass elsewhere.
While Marx scribbled Das Kapital
in the attic his kids suffered from
malnutrition on the first floor.
Marx was a dedicated man and, as 1
we know now having been
enlightened by superdame liber-
tarians, kids are a baggage and a
pain in the ass.

No wonder Karl Marx “labored”
for the redistribution of wealth and
a classless society. So do 1. I’d like
to have a few of the Mellon-Scaife
millions so I can pay my fall tuition,
buy the required books and
maintain my humble position
among the academic bovines.

We might note that’ if Marx
hadn’t been sustained by Friedrich
Engels, we probablywould never
have heard of him‘. This is n'ot to
say Communism would never have"
evolved. The early Christian
Church was a communist society,
but not without status.

ism would have evolved and there“:

is validity in the doctrines and
dogmas Marx and Engels advo-
cated. I
The question, at least one of the
questions, is whether or not Marx
deserves the hero-status he has
been accorded. In my opinion he
does not, and for two reasons?
First, Marx, the person, was hardly
an example of endeavor for the
proletariat; second, Ithink the real
source of what we see in Marx
came from the brain of ‘Herr
Engels. The validity in Marxian
doctrine, as I see it, is the view that
capitalism is a stage in social
evolution, now waning, as social-
ism marches, forward, just as the

trees paraded northward while the 

glaciers receded, the forests to be‘
followed by the grasses.

The status quo must not be bent,
changed or destroyed by revolu-
tion, radicalism or violence.  =
Strangely, as we can observe ‘in
America’s story, status quo, like
religion, has its own built-in
self-destruct factor. And, like

lives. So, in informal America and

u on the relaxed campus of the

present, rite and ritual, pomp and
circumstance, expedite our well
being. So, beloved undergrads,-
please wear .shoes to your
commencement. Skirts, shirts and
ties are apropos, Viva la
commencement! Bravo e brava!
Just don’t rest in status quo.

Ideas &Figures Hits campus  

§

 MATTHEW KENNEDY

Ideas and Figures the student
publication of campus ﬁction, has
ﬁnally arrived at Pitt for the 1975
year.

The anthology consists of forays
into the realms of poetry, fiction,
narrative and other manifestations
ofAmerican literature.

Like all anthologies, Ideas and
Figures ’75 is an adventure. The
reader must search through the
print for those particular concepts,
blasphemies or literary rituals that
appeal to the inner sense of taste.

ome of the autho seem

 

V_ gripped by an irresistible urge to

Even the cover reﬂects . this

resembles the aftermath of .an
explosion in a ﬁlm library. It is
confusing. It defies logical
assimilation, and therefore be-
comes worthless to the witness.

that no amount of literary theory
can excuse. The metaphysics of
writing, communication of exper-
ience and fiction exist only in terms
of the audience. To reject the
witness to the art is to reject the
‘communication.

 

  
   

This sort of self-imposed aliena-
tion on the part of the witer leeches
the most important value of
literature. To affect the witness.

Many of the works in the Ideas
and Figures ’75 seem to speak from
an incredible distance, so remote
from the witness that they are lost.
They become simple typographical
arrangements, shapes of letters‘
arranged in columns. _

This may be the result of a
surrealistic attitude among some of
the authors, or the symptoms of
literary xenophobia that lead them
to deny readers entry into their
visions.

It also may be the result of an
unusual number of rumored
pseudonymns, which the reader
might hope are not a single,
proliﬁc, writer. , (Determined, of
course, to keep his soul to himself).

Particular works, however, make
this anthology worth obtaining. 7

Adrian -McCoy’s “A Persistence
of Vision” portrays a gentle slide
into madness for a young man
obsessed with getting a glimpse of ‘

' Christian’s Comet.

His gradual metamorphosis is
chilling. The growth of obsession
is believable. The fantastical
nature of this piece is delivered in
an elegant style. ‘

- “1941” by William Von Hagen
and “Smokey the Bear” are solid
ﬁction, worth the time away from .
television sets and other more
kinetic communications media-

“194l” deals with the conflict of
self, the struggle under the skin
that drives people into, heroisms
never heard of'in daily papers.

‘V‘Smokey the Bear’_’ is a conflict
in -the classic "guns-brpads-and-
booze genre, although speed has
supplanted the booze. Two
truckdrivers face a threat _from ‘
nameless and" inhuman hijackers in
a sea of trucking lingo and action
that convinces ‘the. reader it’s’
happening. ’

  Fleetwood Mac Performs:
j ‘Tweak Showing, No Punch

BY DOUG GEBHARD

I used to live in Penn Hills--a
suburb of Pittsburgh about ﬁve
"miles from here—-and I can
remember when the Bucks won the
Series in ’60 because Elroy Face
lived near where I did.

Boy...people threw all sorts of

- trash in the streets and his family

partied and we fans ﬂocked t9 his
house like flies around honey...or
the other. A

It must have been the other.

-Last week my friend Scott and I
were the second people in line for
the Fleetwood Mac show. Kids

— swarmed around the entrance for

the concert because it was open
seating...swarming and buzzing
like flies around...the other. '

Chris and .Iohn'McVie, Mick
Fleetwood, Stevie Nicks and

_ Lindsey Buckingham played for a

while and did very little that
excited me...oh, of course they got
demands for two lencores, but who
doesn't? It should be in the
contract.

They played “Station Man,”

 7 .~*‘Rattlesnake Shake,” “Believe In

 
   

Me," “Spare Me A Little,” “Oh
Well" and the ever popular “Don’t
Let Me Down Again”...they didn’t
do “Hypnotized." “Mystery to
‘ Me" or “Sentimental I.’-ady." Why

obvious. His guitar is so ﬁlling and
yet so pervasive in asingle lead
guitar format.

Bob Welch is a guitarist

synonomous with good cherry pie .

filling.

. It seems/that FM has lost the
musical tenacity they once owned.
Old FM had it with a punch and
taking it on the chin. ' I think it’s
comparable "to _BS & T: the
arrangements of ‘ Fred Lipsius
drove me w_ild. , He was a
technician and was as articulate as
hell. Old FM, despite its blues
riffs, had excellent rhythmic,
changes and when Kirwin and
Welch were together the music was
as diverse as Xavier Hollander’s
positions. . .on politics.

Lindsey Buckingham has one
good thing going for him...his
relationship with Stevie Nicks. If
he could play as ﬁne as she looks,
he would be one of the hottest acts
going. As it ‘is now, it sounds like
he listens to one country player and
repeated the licks for three years.
Give him time. If he would sit and
rehearse--the, tour was hastily put '
together--he could prove himself.

The new tunes FM did were
weak. All ended in a jam with the
same sounding changes and they
had to rely on those songs because
they couldn’t'do Welch’s pieces.
Lindsey said he didn't know them.

' It_e.was., quite   Wells ‘ g _  

unobservant, unthinking, uncoord-
inated. It amounts to an insult.

The poetry offerings, especially a
translation of Charles Baudelaire‘
by Gilbert L. K. Marhoefer, are
good reading, depending on your
mood and literary taste.

The exceptions are “Your
Love Is Like A Tadpole Cocooning
Into Butterﬂies Inside My Legs,
Alone: A Masturbatory Apology,”
which is ab wasted attempt at
unknown literary policies. It reeks
of useless anarchy and thus is
unintelligible. In fact Orkwis
seems obligated to footnote his

_ work, dangerous sign in any book,

magazine or pulp thriller. -

This is just a sampling, of
course, of the total contents. The
magazine is an over-all success,fnot
because when it succeeds it does so
as‘ simply a student effort, but
because the work is good.

Perhaps the unusual dichotomy
between the talent and craft
evidenced in pieces. and the
subterranean mindlessness of oth-
ers indicates problems with the
current concept of» Ideas"
Figures.

Certainly the ﬁctional and poetic
effort of campus students deserve
more than a one-shot publication a
year. - .

THE COSMOPOLITAN GIRL by
Rosalyn Drexler, $6.95, Evans, 192

pages.

I should have known what to
expect. One of the accolades of the
jacket of The Cosmopolitian Girl is
from Stanley Elkin, whose last book
included a novella about a ma
seduced by a bear. t

The Cosmopolitan Girl is the
story of a hip young woman and
hertalking dog. If you use your
imagination, you’ll- be able to
create a bizarre "scenario based on

that situation, but it’s unlikely to “

surpass Drexler’s--The" Cosmopol-
itan Girl is always surprising,
consistently amusing.

The Cosmopolitan Girl’s strong-
est asset is its charactters. Not

“If it wasn’t for his weird gift of

Besides her gallery of charac-

about this terriﬁc guy she’s been

Butterworth,- Pocket Books, New
York, paper, 207 pages, $1.50.

Sometime during the past two or
three years--however long it’s
been since the original M*A*S*H
book hit the stands--l must have
closed my eyes, although certainly
not while watching the M*A*S*H
TV series every week.

While I had my eyes closed,
Hooker and Butterworth tapped the
till for more M*A*S*H books,
including -Maine, -New Orleans
and -Paris (M*A*S*H Goes To --).
Unfortunately the TV-series, with
Alan Alda, MacLean Stevenson,

‘Loretta Swit. Gary Burghoff and
Larry ‘ Linville, surpasses" the book

M*A*S*H by so much that it isn’t
even a contest. (The TV series is
probably the only one--in fact, IS
the only one--from which I can
name most of the lead stars.)

If you like so-so writing, you’ll
like this book. It's pretty much all
so-so. Henry the K, the
once-and-future Secretary of State,
puts in a loosely disguised
appearance as he tries to deal with
a very complicated and highly
improbable international exercise
in diplomacy. The best character in
the book is probably Angus
MacKenzie’s Wee‘ Black Doggie,
who stands 8 feet tall, according to
eyewitness accounts.

Actually, the book isn’t really so
bad--but compared to the TV-ser-
ies, the original book or the original

. M*A*S*H movie, it leaves a lot to

be desired.

In Stained Glass

A multi-colored series of 27
stained glass windows will soon

be on display in Oakland’s Essex I A
building at the corner of Meyran I i V

and Forbes Avenues, in thepast
home of the Crab Co-op.

The windows are part of the

interior decorating going on inf . if

preparation for the Omnibus, a

shop offering anything from"

beads to ceramic mugs, greeting

cards to handcrafted jewelry, to ' 
move from across the street and -
add an air of the unique to its new .

residence.

The glass panes, created by
Marsal Stained Glass Studio’s six
craftsmen and designed by artist

Bill Klug, will provide viewers with . I
a fresh approach to graphics in»

stained glass.

Done in art deco style, the
windows will create a mural-like

effect by centering around three '
scenes and running the entire

length and width of the building.
Five bands of color will appear in
each window and will be followed
throughout the series to provide
unity to the work as a whole.

The simple shapes of the circle, .

square and triangle are the basis
for the design of the series, which
have as its focal point a window

The installation of the windows

will take place over the next _few_

‘I The Press looks for scholarly

according to director and editor
‘Frederick Hetzel. “There is a
great deal of scholarship that is
‘ aluable but is not commercially.
viable,” he said. “We have to
-appealtospecialized interests. We
publish.’ good. material that should
available but will probably not
make money.”

The Press is supported by
income from its sales, foundation
grants 1 and from the sale of
subsidiary rights (such as when a
section from 'a book published -by
the. Press is used in a book of
_es.s_ays).’ Any deficits in the budget
is paid by the University.

.-{I-Ietzel is directly responsible to
:Vice Chancellor for Public Affairs
.Bérnard‘Kobosky and the Univer-
 Senate Committee on the
University Press. The committee,
which has the ﬁnal say in all
publishing matters, is composed of
-11»'¥faculty_members, one graduate
‘-and two‘ undergraduate students,
and isgchaired by Dr. Frances L.

sciences fields. The Press
publishes four special series, all of
which have international notice:
the Pitt Latin American Series, the
Pitt Poetry Series, the Contempor-
ary Community Health Series, and
the Pittsburgh Series in Biblio-
graphy.

. The Poetry Series grew out of the
Pittsburgh-based International
Poetry Forum when its director,
Dr. Samuel Hazo, asked the Press
to operate the United States Award
poetry competition. The ‘contest is
open to American poets who have
not _ previously had a book
publishesd. The Press publishes
the winning manuscript.

Other poetry books in the series
are by authors who come to the

attention of the Press through the .

contest. “We have one of the beset
lists~of contemporary poetry in the
US,” Hetzl said.

The Press boasts an impressive
number of awards.
poetry books have won the Lamont
Poetry Prize, the Commonwealth
Prizeof the Commonwealth Insti-
tute of London, and have been
nominated four times for the
National Book Award. The Press
also has received 34 awards for
book design.

Press publications also have
been noticed in an extensive
number of reviews. Hetzl said in a

three year period 139 Press books‘

were treated in 837 reviews. More

than 400 publications, including.

the New York Times, Newsweek,
and Wall Street Journal, have
printed these .reviews. Hetzl
includes these reviews in his
annual report to the Senat
Committee._ '

  Buying  What Others Write  

“eUni’v. Press.

Individual.

Unsolicited manuscripts often
come to Hetzl’s desk, but he said,
“The best ones come through the
committee members or authors
who have beenpublished by the
Press who have friends doing
research.” Hetzl said he tries to
keep in touch with ongoing
research for possible subject
material, but relies mainly on the
information network of the com-
mittee.

In fiscal year '1973-74,. the Press
rejected 391 manuscripts. Sifting
through all those is Hetzl’s job. “I
look for literacy and an ability to
handle the English language with
clarity)’ he said. Some manu-

scripts are rejected initially be-..

cause they are trivial. “Some
manuscripts contain a ,
pretentious scholarship and undue
seriousness with a particular
subject,” he said.

Hetzl sends acceptable manu-
scrips to specialist readers and
uses their evaluations in deciding
whether }a book should be
published. Once Hetzl’s decision is

approved by the Senate Commit-'

tee, the editorial staff begins close
work with the author on majo
rewriting and copywriting. ’
Next, the designer decides .. on
,the kind of type to be used,‘ the
cover illustration, and other physi-
cal aspects of thie book. “A book is

laid out as carefully as an architect '

lays out the design of a building,”
Hetzl said, expressing an attitude
that has resulted in the Press’s
numerous design awards..

The ﬁnal stages are the initial
printing, proofing, and final
printing and binding processes.
Printers are contracted, but -all

lot of

other work is done in the offices on
North Bellefield Avenue.

Of the 25-30 books published
annually by the Press, Hetzl said
about 25% were authored by Pitt
faculty. Hetzl is interested in
regional literature but encounters

some problems with it. “We have —

an obligation to this region,” he
said. “But it’s sometimes hard to
find enough literature in this area
which is of the. type the Press
publishes.”

For the first 25 years after its
founding in 1936, the Press dealt
only with books by Western
Pennsylvania authors or with
regional subject matter. But in
"order to increase sales, the Press
found it necessary to expand their
horizons. _ _.

“The trick is to ﬁnd regional
material with importance outside

this region,” Hetzl said. One book ’
-that accomplishes this is ‘ an

illustrated catalog of the complete
paintings of Pittsburgh artist John
Kane with his autobiography “Sky
Hooks.” »
The Press also is publishing a
special bicentennial selection of
books dealing with the _ Western
Pennsylvania area. Included in the
Pittsburgh Bicentennial Books is
Pittsburgh: The Story of a City by

’ Leland D. Baldwin.

The Bicentennial Selection of the
International Poetry ‘Forum is one
that Hetzl regards as a valuable
asset. The Great American Fourth
of July Parade by Archibald
MacLeish is expected to sell quite
well.

The - sale of, selections such as
this one help to offset the‘ losses

  Keating May Share
,0fr Super Steeler Win

PITTSBURGH ‘AP--Tom Keating
,. was vacationing in Mexico last
-January when his former Pitts-

’ burgh Steeler teammates won the ,

Super Bowl, but there’s a chance
he could get a $25,000 winners’
5.7-share. ,- _ 
The possibility was raised with a
recent National Labor Relations
Board ruling involving Keating,
who watched the Super Bowl on
Spanish-language : television.

The NLRB directed the National
Football League to answer.charges '

' that Keating and three other

' players were cut or waived because '

 their leadership roles in the
 players’ strike last season. '

After the strike, Keating was
traded by the Steelers to the
Kansas City Chiefs.

“I certainly think  would have
been with the Steelers if it hadn’t
been for the strike,” Keating said
by phone from his Alameda, Calif.
home. . A

“It does seem strange that all

A the officers in the union wretraded
or waived,” he added. “I don’t
,.-.3 think it was a coincidence. In fact, I

strike ended.”

Part:

, Keating, who was vice president
of the "NFL Players’ Association’,
added that he.wasn’t optimistic of
getting a Super Bowl check.

f‘You really think I’m going to
win the way the courts work? The’
people who usually win are the one

- with the most money. I’m‘ a cynic

about all this,” he said. ‘

During the 1973 season with

Pittsburgh, Keating altern ted at.

defensive tackle with Ernie omes,
who became a fulltime starter after

Keating’s backup spot wastaken '

by rookie Charlie Davis.

The Steelers have insisted that
Keating, once an American Foot-
ball Conference All-Star’ with
Oakland, was not traded because of
his union activity.‘

However, team Vice President
Dan Rooney and Coach Noll have
declined comment while the NLRB
case is in litigation. '

N011 and his assistant coaches A

have already given depositions
regarding the Keating trade.
There’s a possibility Noll will have

O Lift Post Season Bowl Ban

SAN FRANCISCO AP-—The Big

Ten and the Paciﬁc-8 appear set to‘

lift the ban that bars their football
teams from playing in any
postseason bowl games except the
Rose Bowl. .

"is.., Under the proposal, the league

S champions would continue their

traditional rivalry in the Tourna-
ment of Roses game at Pasadena,
but others could accept bids to
other bowls.

Acceptance by the Big Ten
becamea virtual certainty -Tuesday
when _Michigan’s Athletic Board of
Control voted to accept the plan. It
was the sixth school in
10-member league to vote affirma-

. tively. A simple majority will be
needed when the school presidents
take the ofﬁcial action Aug.4.

“The Big Ten Conference is in a
process of individual ratiﬁcation by
,J”‘ai.ts members with reference to
e'\~ playing in other bowls.” Wiles
Hallock, executive. director of the
Paciﬁ_c-8 said Wednesday: “The

.favors participation in other
bowls.” I ‘ » 1

Currently , the ‘champions_ of. the

the ‘

Big Ten and the Pacific-8 meet in
the Rose Bowl gave with no other
teams from those conferences
permitted to play in other bowls.

There is no meeting set for the

‘presidents of the Paciﬁc-8 schools

until December, but Hallock
pointed out‘that ratiﬁcation could
come in one of several ways,
including a vote by mail or a
conference telephone call connect-
ing all the school leaders. '

If the restriction is lifted, Big Ten
schools are expected to be able to
consider invitations to "the other

‘major bowls such as the Cotton,

Sugar and Orange at the end of the
1975 season. ‘

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

An English writing graduate
program is slated for opening in the
fall of 1976, according to members

_ of the English faculty.

The program, touted as the only
program of its kind in the tri-state
area, will provide three concentra-
tions, fiction, non-fiction and
poetry.

A division of the existing English
Department's MA program, the
graduate writing program plans to
accomodate full-time students not
interested in teaching, full-time
students interested in_ teaching,
and part-time students established
in jobs in the city.

According to Professor Mont-
gomery Culver, chairman of the
committee that developed the
graduate writing proposal, al-
though the program is a division of
the English lit program, the
graduate writing programpwill not
affect the graduate literature

studies.

The graduate English writing
program would be staffed by the
present writing faculty plus the
novelist Mark Harris, author of the
-novel Bang the Drum Slowly, who
will join the University faculty in
September, 1975.

“Although it will place a slight
strain on the writing faculty,”
Culver said, “We can start the
program with the faculty we have
now.”

“If we could spend money to hire
more faculty, we’d like to, but if we
can’t we will bear the strain,"
Culver added.

The program was unanimously
approved by the English Depart-

ment, according to Associate’

Professor of ‘Writing, Lee Gutkind.
“It was clear to everyone that we
needed more faculty, although, we
could conceivably get underway
without adding more staff,”
Gutkind said.
