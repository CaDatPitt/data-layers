Recycling continues

By Jennifer McGinnis
Staff Writer

The second “Recycle

I Wee ” of the year is off to a

slow start, but members of
Pitt’s Recycling Coalition
remain confident that things
will pick up.

The Coalition said they
hope that more recycling
activities later this week and
increased awareness about
Recycle Week on campus will
make up for the first day’s
poor participation.

Recycling bins for glass,
aluminum, newspaper, office
paper and 0‘ plastics were
placed outside of the William
Pitt Union yesterday after-

noon, but not many recy-
clables were deposited in
them. Student Environmental
Action Coalition member
Susan Curry said the last
Recycle Week also began
slowly. “At the last one, the
bins didn’t fill up until the
end of the.week,” she said. '
Last semester's Recycle
Week had a successful end,
and SEAC said they think
that the trend will continue.
Curry estimates that 200
pounds of newspapers were
collected by the end of the
last Recycle Week. Glass fol-
lowed as the second highest

_ recycled item.

When student groups at other universities
asked Jack Daniel to speak about topics like
“the meaning of being a black man in the ‘90s”
and “Where do we go from here?,” Daniel
declined to speak about something he said
should be obvious. ‘

“African-American men in the 1990s need to
be on the Dean’s List every semester,” said the
associate provost for academic affairs last
night at the William Pitt Union. ,

Daniel encouraged the audience of about 50
to go to every class for which they register and
to reach for higher than mediocre grades.

“You needto walk the walk of a"man and not
. just talk the talk of a BET, MTV adolescent,”
Daniel said. i '

Just as an eagle locks its wings and rises
above a storm, young African Americans
should free themselves. from the grasp of
stormy circumstances by realizing that they
can accomplish anything, Daniel said.

And by learning what struggles have forged

.African-American history, young people can
get a better sense of who they are and what
they can accomplish, he said.

Instead of reciting a litany of African-
American heroes for Black History Month,
young people should remember all the labor of
the slaves in the South, the babies who burned
in southern churches, and those who gave their
last pennies to the civil rights movement:

Young people can learn how togo on by‘ask- - »
ing “what got African Americans through the
holocaust in America?” Daniel said. _

Diversity Seminar

The Diversity Working Group, in conjunction with
the Office of the Chancellor, will offer a seminar this
summer to help professors who want to make the con-
tent and method of teaching in their courses more gen-

The Chancell'or’s Diversity Working Group Faculty

May 15-26 and will include: discussion of new content
for existing courses, new material for their syllabus,
outside and local speakers and reading lists.

ing and wondering whether
all the accomplishments of
the civil rights movement
had slipped away, he said.

Today, when Daniel reads
about “young black people
killing each other day after
day after day,” he also ques-
tions and comes close to
tears.

“We as a people are hem-

_ orrhaging internally,” he

said. p

Although Daniel lifted up
some of the successes of the
civil rights movement, such
as the greater number of
African Americans receiv-
ing college degrees, he said
the internal conflicts have
escalated and need to be
addressed.

Society should explore ,

ways to “stop the bleeding,”
he said. African Americans
should focus on “common
sense” approaches, such as
excelling academically and
nurturing families.

“Quit” looking for gim-
micks, slogans and grand
master plans,” he said. “We
need to get back to basics,
to get back to common
sensefi

Families provide the
nutrients that keep society
healthy. If a‘ man and
woman raise a child togeth-
er, people would not, have to
worry so much about Newt
Gingrich and his orphanage,
Daniel said.’

But some rap artists, such
as Snoop Doggy Dogg;‘»..brag
about making "babies and
not taking responsibility for
them, he said. African-
American men need to
develop meaningful rela-
with women,
resulting in stronger fami-
lies.

Daniel said he woke up

and became aware of the C
' importance of father-son .

relationships when his
grown son showed him
poems that he had written
about-their fishing trips. His
son equated the rope that
connected father and son
when they waded into the
water with the emotional
cord that will tie them
together forever.

i

These cords can also tie
the African-American com-
munity together.

The African-American
man of the ‘90s should be
“someone who has enough
knowledge, patience, love
and understanding to pro-
vide children with the ropes
they need to survive in life,”

he said.

’ Part of that survival
should include a solid core
of values, Daniel said.
African Americans through-
out history have grounded
their beliefs in a fundamen-
tal religion, have learned
how to make a way out of
no way and have forgotten
the meaning of tired, he
said. Today, if young people
don’t hold a set of core val-
ues, anything will sway
them. '

“If you don’t have that
strong something at the core
of your being, you’ll be
blown by any wind that

comes through,” he said.

Daniel said he didn’t want
to argue religion, but that
young people should see
that every human being is
spiritual in nature._ Such a
vision would uplift the way
we treat others.

Daniel challenged the
members of the audience to
decide what will become of
them and of African
Americans as a people.
Asked to predict what will
happen to the African-
American community,
Daniel said, “what’s in store
for us is what we in this
room decide to do.”

That includes career goals
and academic achievement,
he said.

“If every African-
American man on this cam-
pus was walking through
this campus with a 4.0, 
we would be an incredible
people,” he said. “But that’s
our history.”

a.re wanting to recycle those
and there is ‘no way to do that

This Recycle Week has far

one, SEAC member Mike
Kaizar said. Along with
SEAC, the Student

involved in planning Recycle

together,” said Kaizar. “In
that way it’s already been a
great success.” _

A Recycle Week informa-
tion table will be set up in
Schenley Cafeteria today and
Tower’s Lobby this Friday.
Pamphlets, flyers and posters
explaining why students

should recycle and what can
and can’t be recycled at Pitt

are available. Approximately _

50 to 60 people stopped at the
table yesterday to ask ques-

tions about recycling on cam-_

pus, Kaizar said.

Members of Circle K and
Campus Women’s

recyclables door-to-door in
Towers A and B today and
Friday. “We really support
recycling on campus and
don’t understand why every
organization wouldn’t,” said
CWO ‘co-president Scott

help out with this and we

Dolin said.

ic behavior of women to
teaching about the behavior
of large groups of women
and minorities and their role
in history.

Some of the suggested
changes for the method of
teaching could be giving
women and minorities more
of a chance to speak in the
classroom because, she said,
“I don’t want to generalize,
but in a lot of classes the
people who speak the most
are white males that come
from certain backgrounds.”

Novy said the idea for the.’

seminar came from various
sources including other uni-
versities around the country.
“I served on the Provost
Committee on Dimension of
Gender in Undergraduate
Curriculum where we exam-
ined colleges that have had

seminars to make their cur-

riculum more diverse,” said

Novy. “The results were very
exciting.”

Schools like the University
of Maryland and the
University of Illinois had
similar seminars, and the
“New Jersey Project” includ-
ed diversifying schools in
New Jersey.

But Novy said it wasn’t
just the other universities that
helped show a need for this
type'of seminar, but also
books that have been written
about the conditions in some
classrooms. Books like
Failing At Fairness, by Myra
and David Sadker from
American University, found
that instructors tend to call
on white males more often,
and white males also tend to
speak up in the classroom
more often than other groups.

ing that the seminar will lead

The seminar is funded by
the Office of the Chancellor
and offers stipends of $1,500

The Diversity Working

Opinions
Blackheads?

The controversy never ends, and once again, when people think
about their meal plans, they are left wondering what kind of block-
head designed them.

After last semester’s block debacles including block dumping,
block parties and people being blocked from using their blocks,
changes were instituted in the whole system for this semester. Yet,
those changes don’t appear to be a snake oil solution. Now, the
Marriott corporation plans to make things easier by complicating the.
food plans as a whole. Now, instead of blocks and choice dollars,
students can either get three, ﬁve or seven meals per week. The rest
of the meals would be paid for something called “Marriott Dollars,”
which are almost, but not quite unlike choice dollars.

Under the old plans of 14- or 19—meals-a—week plans, none of this
was a consideration. For those who wanted more options, there were
choice dollars. For those who wanted to try and subsist on cafeteria
food, there were the straight meal plans. It was a simple system that
seemed to work. Now, the students are being experimented on, and
losing money in the process. Marriott says they are losing money.
Where is all the money going? _

Regardless, if things cannot be worked out with blocks and
choice dollars, then the simplest option would be to put all the
students on the choice dollars plan. Then, they would have the
freedom to purchase what they wanted and have more ﬂexibility
in where they spent them. If this is completely unfeasible,
straight blocks and choice dollars is the best option. Should
blocks prove to be completely unworkable, then let’s return to
traditional meal "plan values.

Blocklrecrcls!

On Tuesday night, basketball fans received a shock as a Rutgers
game with Massachusetts turned into a misguided protest. According
to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, approximately 150 students staged a
sit-in over allegedly racist remarks made by Rutgers President Francis
Lawrence. According to 172e.New York Times, the remark was made
duringa two-hour long faculty meeting and, in context, provoked no
immediate charges of racisrn.- What Lawrence actually said was: “the
average SAT’s for Africafi A“mericans is 750. Do we set standards in
the future so we don’t admit anybody? Or do we deal with disadvan-
taged population that doesn’t have the genetic, hereditary background

‘to have a higher average? So you’ve got to respond from a different

direction_from different‘ issues, and they’re out there.” In light of
Lawrence’-s record, the charges, based on the three words “genetic

When Lawrence arrived at Rutgers, he included in his inaugural
address was the need to increase the diversity of the Rutgers campus.
A $5 million scholarship fundraising campaign for minorities was
begun, and he appointed four blacks to top positions in his adminis-
tration. While at Tulane University, he was instrumental in increasing
their minority enrollment to the highest among private universities.

Response to George Orwell '5 pride

ile partaking in my
daily ritual of leaﬁng
through The Pitt

News, I was rudely and abrupt-
ly interrupted by Erika Kendra.

I make it a point to read the

Opinions section especially in
order to better gauge my per-
ception of the barometer of
social consciousness that the
many individuals that I share
this campus with harbor. Yet
when I read this intentionally
inﬂammatory editorial, I was

4 left with an uncannily queasy

sort of emotion. When ile fin-
ished reading it, I felt a surge of
initiative; I knew then what I
had to do. Icould not let this

‘ultra-conservative, Limbaugh-

esque opinion go unanswered.
Ms. Kendra addressed the
fact that the diversity seminars
that she was FORCED to attend
as a freshman were silly. She
even went so far as to paint a

_ picture that was analogous with

some sort of Orwellian theme.

The paranoia that accompanies

so warped ‘a view of cultural

— acceptance makesit seem as if

some sort of proverbial “Big

Brother” is brainwashing the-.

Pitt community at large. If
Kendra knew anything about
George Orwell’s literature, she
would know that he was consid-
ered to be years ahead, of his
time in what-he was writing
about. He was in no way glori-
fying some sort of communist

E state in which its members’ atti-

tudes are shaped to ﬁt a certain
set of beliefs. '

Ms. Kendra went on to say
that she is not here to be indoc-
trinated, but to get an education.
The kind of education that she
feels she is entitled to-is one
free of multiculturalist view-
points. Exactly who do you
think you will be interacting
with in and out of the work-
place at the conclusion of your
academic pursuits? It is not the
traditional minorities like
African-Americans, Latinos and
Asians that need to be reminded

to ﬁght inequality. So you see,

the process of “indoctrination”.

that you abhor is not only for
you, it is aboutyou.
Kendra mentioned’ the widely

lpublicizedjfact that the African‘

Americans here on campus are
lobbying the university to build
an African Cultural Center. It is

obvious that Ms. Kendra"-do'ese’

not realize how socially danger-
ous the attitude‘ of complacency
can be. If YOUR founding
fathers just accepted things the
way they were, there would still
be 13 colonies paying tax to
England. A
And the preposterous notion
that the building of an African
Cultural Centerwould in some
way promote self-induced seg-
regation is absurd. The African
Cultural Center would be the
embodiment of a celebration of
African cultural eachievernent —
things people need to recognize
and commit to memory.

Understand that growing up
African American in this _cour1- 

try can cause you to think ‘that
whites are the creators of every-
That goes back to what we
were “indoctrinated” with dur-
ing our schooling, for lack of a
better word. I was one of the
lucky ones, however. I was
raised believing I can d_o all
things with an extremely
Afrocentric background. Yet
there are many numbers of peo-
ple whose parents rejected that
view and refused to raise their
children Afrocentrically, which
indirectly bred an attitude of
conformity and self-hate. Some
of these African Americans

~attend__ Pitt. Would an African

Cultural Center not benefit
them as well?

Kendra went on to say that
the whole concept of diversity
is used by minorities to gain

* special privileges. It is obvious

that she, like others, carries this
feeling of guilt for what your
forefathers did to my people
hundreds of, years -later.

Accompanying that feeling of
guilt is the fear that if African
Americans ever unite and claim
the power we can wield that we
will do to your people‘ what
yours have done to us. On the
contrary, the vast majority of
African Americans inthis coun-
try are not looking for retribu-
tion. We would much rather;
know that the many contribu-
tions that we have given to this‘-
country and the_w_orld are
acknowledged. " ‘ ‘ g

Therefore, if you have" no
desire to learn of these things,
don’t elect to take any Africana
"studies classes. It’s amazing

how you, and as you claim oth-_

ers, complain about the ideolo-
gies taught, yet every semester,
without fail, these classes are
the ﬁrst to close. White students

who really have no genuine?
interest in being enlightened
take seats from those of us who;
.do..I can’t get into Africana
studies classes unless I-’~m~-rfortu-O-‘

nate enough to register on the

first ‘day of _registration, because
f,white ‘students who don’t want

to be there take .up allthe seats._
A fewyears ago a museum
was built in,Washington as a
testament to
‘Holocaust. Why is it, however,
that when African-Americans
want to throw their hands up in
a show of solidarity and anger
in memory of all that we have
endured, we are told, “Keep
quiet,” “Don't rock the boat” or
‘simply to just “Forget about it?”
Kendra must realize that I
descend from a race of people
whose spirit carmot be broken, a

people who refuse to die. It is .

because of these people that I
am able to sit here and write
this rebuttal. I ﬁnd it deplorable

that in 1995 it is necessary to - -

remind someone that we are
still here. If that doesn’t give
you a quick lesson in diversity,
nothing will. ‘

' lems? If so, then you can
Rick _ join the Republican Party
Nowlm and put together some ill-

conceived legislation that
people think they want but which will
eventually cost money, and more, in the
long run.Such describes the GOP_’s
?‘Contract VVith America,” which most of
its congressional candidates signed during
the last campaign. What’s worse, now that
Republicans control both houses of the U.

l S. Congress, they’ll try to keep that

promise within 100 days. I don’t think
they’ll get very far. Let’s look at what the
Contract calls for, according to the Wall

; Street Journal:

1) The Fiscal Responsibility Act,

I which calls for a constitutional amendment

to balance the federal budget by 2002 and
a presidential line—item veto. First of all,
forget about the ‘balanced-budget amend-
ment; it’ll be dead in the water once it gets
to the states. While most Americans say
that they want a balanced budget, two-
thirds of them would oppose it if it meant
cuts in Medicare, which takes about a third
of the budget. Moreover, the GOP is plan-
ning to put Social Security on the chopping
block — which should prove to be politi-
cally suicidal. Sen. Santorum nearly lost
his race against Harris Wofford when the
Wofford campaign insinuated that
Santorum would delay Social Security
benefits until age 70. '

As for a presidential line-item veto, the
Constitution may have something to say
about that; Congress, not the president, has
the final say on budget issues. “But the
states have it for their governors,” you
protest. Irrelevant — you’d need another
amendment altogether; no way it would
pass.

2) The Taking Back Our Streets Act.
Throw the book at ‘em, build more pris-
ons, lock ‘em up and toss the key and let
them fry if the crime is particularly horri-
ble. These things are going to cut crime?
Building more prisons will cost money,
coming either from higher taxes or cuts in
other spending, and housing one prisoner
for one year cost more than sending a child
to college. Then again, who wants to put a
prison in his or her own backyard? As for
capital punishment, we all know that only
the least politically powerful convicts will
face it. And then the GOP wants to cut
proven crime-prevention programs like
“midnight basketball.”

3) The Personal Responsibility Act.
The GOP wants to cut off welfare beneﬁts
to minors with children, the idea being that
if they don’t have a source of income, they
won’t get pregnant.They also want to take
away most beneﬁts after two years. And
then those people they just threw off the
rolls will start selling drugs in order to sur-
vive, as where most welfare recipients live
there are only minimum wage jobs_ (if any
at all). And they won’t be able to build
enough prisons to hold all the dealers. (See
no. 2.) I

4) The Family Reinforcement Act.
Here’s one I agree with, at least on the sur-
face. It deals with deadbeat parents, child
pornography and tax credits for elderly
dependents. One question remains: How
will these be paid for?

5) The American Dream Restoration
Act.Itcallsfora$500peryearperchild

tract "ON"

tax credit, “repeal of marriage-tax penalty”
and expanded individual retirement
accounts. Admittedly, the juiy’s still out on
this one. Again, how will they be financed?
Sounds like more for the rich once again.

6) The National Security Restoration
Act, which will not allow American troops
to serve under the auspices of the United
Nations. That’ll go over well with the rest
of the world, I’m sure. We haven’t been
known as “Ugly Americans” for nothing. It
also calls for increases in defense spending
——- can you say “oink”? This has nothing to
do with American security and everything
to do with keeping defense contractors
happy so that they provide jobs in certain
key Congressional districts, thus keeping
certain GOP politicians in office. 4

7) The Senior Citizens Fairness Act,
which will rais’e the Social Security earn-
ings lirnit and repeal 1993 tax increases on
higher-income recipients. An oxymoron.
Once again, “Who will pay for this?” .

8) The Job Creation and Wage
Enhancement Act. Anything but. It calls
for a halving of the capital-gains tax and
little else, and that money" will go right
back into companies’ pockets. I recently
heard radio talk show host Jim Hightower
mention that all the tax breaks given to
companies in Louisiana created exactly
one full-time job in that state. Small busi-
ness incentives? The Small Business
Administration itself is on the chopping
block. Anyway, we tend to forget that com-
panies are in business for one reason —— to
make money —— and they don’t care much
how they do it.

9) The Common Sense Legal Reform
Act. Do I hear “caveat emptor” some-
where? So we allow them to produce prod-
ucts or maintain services that they know to
be dangerous or even deadly and let them
get off with a slap on the wrist? How much
is the GOP getting under the ‘table for that
one? Sure, punitive damage awards can be
a little out of hand, but they’re so few and
far between that it’s not worth worrying
about. Anyway, corporations might consid-
er such “nuisance” suits as the cost of
doing business. Next thing you know,
they’ll be demanding tax breaks for that.

10) The Citizen Legislator Act - also
known as “term limits.” We will see Pat
Robertson endorse President Clinton

before we see those, for two reasons. One,

the public’s anger toward Congress is
directed merely to the body itself —— not
necessarily toward individual politicians.
Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.), colloquially
known as the “King of Pork,” is at least
honest about it. He has always said, “I’m
here to get whatever I can for West
Virginia.” In truth, we send people to
Congress to take from the federal till and
get something for their districts.Two, there
is yet another obstacle to term limits, -the
Constitution. Every last referendum or law
that has ever been passed on the state level
restricting the time legislators can serve has
been overturned in the courts, on the
grounds that previous service is no reason
to be ineligible. Presidents and some gov-
ernors are constitutionally limited from
serving more than one or two terms, and I
don’t think that many lawmakers would be
keen on voting themselves out of office.
What looks on the surface like an innov-
ative way of governing will inevitably lead
to the same old games that we’ve gotten
used to. I’ve heard a number of people call
this phony legislation the “Contract On
America” —- and Ican’t say I disagree.

News.

  

Or "WITH" America

" s the Greek
philosopher
eracleitussaid,

“Nothing is permanent
except change.” On
Sept. 27 of last year the
Republicans signed the

 

Colummst Contract With America
T011 hoping to change
Di ensheets America more radically

than it’s been since
FDR was in the White House. For the ﬁrst
time in modern American politics, a polit-
ical party laid out its plan for the future,

and on Nov. 8 the American people V

responded with overwhelming support.
No Republican incumbent lost, and the
Democrats lost control of Congress for
the first time in 40 years. While the
Contract has its ﬂaws and will clearly not
solve all of America’s problems, if passed
it will be the best piece of legislation to
come out of Congress in decades.

While there is no doubt that the
Contract will cost some money in the
short-term, to look at it merely in a fman—
cial sense is the type of short-sightedness
that is at the root of many of the nation’s

problems. Keeping predators off the

streets will cost money, as will ending the
welfare state. But when one looks at the
social beneﬁts that will be derived from
such public policies, they will surely ben-
eﬁt America in the long—terrn.

In almost every survey which asks
Americans what worries them the most
about our society, crime is always at the
top of the list. In the first 100 days of the
104th Congress, the Republicans will try
to lay the foundation for a fair justice sys-
tem that will empathize with the victims
and not coddle the thugs. It will allow
police to take control of the streets away
from the predators and give it back to
law-abiding citizens.

Anyone who questions just how endem-
ic crime is in America need only pick up a
newspaper or watch the news.
Throughout our nation’s cities violent
crime rates continue to rise and the num-
ber of gangs continues to grow. CBS
News has recently reported that in
Chicago the number of gang members is
equivalent to seven infantry units of the

U.S. Army. Every year the age of violent"

offenders and murderers gets younger.
The sad fact of the matter is that in many
cities of this country, people have lost the
most basic of human rights — the right to
be able to walk the streets after dark with-
out fear so as to enjoy the cultural and
social life of our urban centers. In every
industrialized nation except the United
States, downtown cities are the showcases
of their societies —— in America they are
war zones.

The second bill in the Contract is the
Taking Back Our Streets Act. Its goals are
to repeal parts of the so-called crime bill
that was passed last year by the
Democratic Congress and to require the
courts to have stronger truth—in-sentenc-
ing. In other words, if criminals do the
crime, they really do the time. Clearly
this is not happening now. Every 90 sec-
onds a violent offender is released from
prison; of these, 88 percent will commit
crimes, 33 percent will commit violent
crimes.

At present, the “justice system” is unde-
niably inadequate at keeping predators off
the streets. According to the FBI, the aver-
age time served (in years) for murder,
rape, robbery and assault are 5.5, 3.0, 2.25
and 1.25 respectively. Once these preda-
tors are released from jail, 60 percent are

rearrested within three years.

Liberal arguments that building more
jails has not decreased the crime rates are
just wrong. According to the National
Academy of Sciences, between 1976-90
increased incarceration lowered crime
rates by an estimated 10-15 percent.
When one considers the fact that 6 per-
cent of all criminals are responsible for 70
percent of ab violent crime, it is indis-
putable that keeping criminals locked up

will invariably make our society a safer I

place for all its citizens.

Another key target of the Contract is to
eliminate the cycle of poverty which has
been perpetuated by 30 years of Great
Society liberal-social welfare programs.
The Personal Responsibility Act will dis-
courage illegitimacy and teen pregnancy
by not giving welfare to girls under the
age of 18 and denying increased AFDC
money for additional children that women
have while on welfare. All welfare recipi-
ents will have all beneﬁts eliminated after
two years, meaning that they will be
forced to work like the vast majority of
Americans already do. This isn’t “mean-
spirit ” as the liberals whine that it is, it
is about making all members of society
contribute and earn their own living.

The Family Reinforcement Act is cru-
cial to the rebuilding of American society.
The family has been stretched to its limits
by an elitist Left which has tried to
degrade and warp the very social values
that founded our civilization. Under this
bill the Republicans will stress child sup-
port enforcement, strengthening the rights
of parents in their children’s education
and tougher child pornography laws.
These goals shouldn’t be seen as being
partisan in nature, they are merely what is
found in any civilized society. The plain
fact of the matter is that when one looks at
ALL countries around the world, the fam-
ily is the nucleus ofsociety. Much as they
are trying to rewrite history, the liberals
want us to believe that it is only in the
male-dominated, Eurocentric nations
where the family reigns supreme. This
couldn't be farther from the truth. One
reason for the success of the East Asian
countries is their strong family ties.
America was made strong by the same
sort of family network, and unless the cur-
rent situation changes, we’ll be brought
down by the collapse of the family. a

The American Dream Restoration Act
is of particular importance to our genera-
tion,since many people don’t believe that
we’ll be better off than our parents. In
fact, according to an ABC survey in
January, only a mere 54 percent believe
that our generation will live as well as our
parents. This ﬁgure is down from 74 per-
cent in.l986 and 66 percent in 1991. The
major goals of this bill will be to repeal

the marriage tax which costs couples .

money after getting married, and the cre-
ation of the American Dream Savings
Accounts which are meant to provide
long overdue tax relief for those in the
middle-class that want to save some of
their earnings.

Although the Contract is only a begin-
ning in an attempt to solve America’s
many social ills, its goals will beneﬁt Q
Americans. Its goals are very clearly those
of the voting public and should be imple-
mented as such. If they are, America will
be better off than it was just several
months ago and will have a blueprint for
the future.

Stupignorancy: destitute of
knowledge or education; given to
unintelligent decisions or acts;
lacking intelligence —— Francis
Lawrence.

If this name means nothing to
you, read on. If you are aware of
who he is, again, read on. Why
you ask? Vifrthin a day or two his
name will be all over the media
— radio, television, and newspa-
per, if it already isn’t.

University of Rutgers President
Francis Lawrence sparked a uni-
versity-wide protest with racially
inﬂammatory comments. The
protest took place at Tuesday
nights UMass-Rutgers basketball
game shortly after the ﬁrst half of
play ended.

In what could amass to become
as large as the “Jimmy the
Greek” episode back in the late

1980s, Lawrence stated the fol-
lowing:

“The average SAT for African-
Americans is 750. Do we set
standards in the future so that we
don’t admit anybody with the
national test? Or do we deal with
a disadvantaged population that

' doesn’t have that genetic heredi-

tary background to have a higher
average?”

Now the first thing that
Lawrence will claim is that his
words were taken out of context.
Forget it. Context or no context,
one would think that a man of his
position would be less ignorant.

As we struggle to clear the
stamp of racism from our coun-
try, leaders such as Lawrence
have only dug the hole deeper,
burying all of our heads in the
ground.

Some might say that he is a dis-
grace to white Americans, but in
fact he is a disgrace to all
Americans. The presidential
mouth of a man who was chosen
to lead a higher learning institu-
tion has disgraced mankind.

It is another scarlet letter
emblazoned on every chest and
mind of people in this country.
But what it should be is a positive
lesson to learn from.

Last night at the Field
House, the Pitt Lady Panthers
snapped their three-game los-
ingistreak by beating Big East
foe Georgetown 80-71. Pitt
raised their record to 13-8
overall and 7-6 in league play.

Head coach Kirk Bruce’s

game plan was to work the,’

Lady Hoyas inside and then
look for the perimeter shot.

‘ “We felt as though if we
went inside hard, it would
open up the perimeter and we
just needed to get our perime-
ter players going,” said Bruce.

This worked to near perfec-
tion as the Lady Panthers came
out sizzling the silk, shooting
46 percent from the field in the
first half and finishing the
game at 52 percent.

“Anytime you shoot over 50
percent you’re probably going
to win the game,” said Bruce.

Junior guard Stephanie
Petho was the beneficiary,
scoring a career-high 29
points. She also had four
rebounds and knocked down
10 of 11 from the foul line.

On the inside, it was Latia
Howard-grabbing 11 boards,
blocking one shot and scoring
seven.

The junior from Mount

but success in her diving career
here at Pitt.

“I like doing well. The diving
team has had a very successful
season,” said Lewandowski.
“Everyone is working really
hard to help the team in the Big

Lewandowski started her div-
ing career in high school after
she decided that gymnastics no
longer gave her the thrill that it
once did.

“I needed a change,” said
Lewandowski. “I got burned out
of gymnastics, and I needed
something else to do with my
time. I am not the type of per-
son that can sit around and do
nothing.”

Her diving career took off
immediately. “My gymnastics
ability definitely helped with
my diving.” _

The accolades came at an
amazing pace. In her sopho-
more year of high school,
Lewandowski won the WPIAL
Districts. The older she got, the

the game, a three, to stop the
streaking Panthers. It didn’t
last long though, as the Lady
Hoyas’ head coach Pat Knapp
was the recipient of a technical
foul. Petho knocked down the
free throws and Julie Fomadel
dropped in a layup, taking the
lead up to 27-11, Pitt’s largest
lead of the game.

Georgetown then went on a
run of their own, scoring nine
points. Ebiho
Ahonkhai made two jumpers
and two free throws, making it
27-20. After a Pitt timeout,
Erin Miller came off the bench
to knock down one of her two
three-pointers of the night and
stop the run.

The half ended on a three-
point play by Petho. She was
fouled with one second left;
the layup fell and so did the
foul shot. Pitt was ahead 42-
30.

More important than the 12 _
point lead at the half for the

Most basketball players
love to shoot the ball. You
can bet a lot of those play-
ers wouldn’t mind being
in Erin Miller’s shoes. The
5-foot-9 sophomore guard
is one of the Lady
Panthers top reserves. She
was brought to Pitt for one
reason: to score.

Miller’s offensive fire-
works attracted plenty of
attention during her senior
year at Oakland Catholic
High School where she
averaged 13 points, five
rebounds and three assists
per game. In addition, she
sank 57 three-pointers and
also blocked 45 shots.

But despite the fact that
she had a solid all—around
game, most of the schools
that recruited her seemed
to be most interested in
the three-pointers. A num-
ber of schools came call-
ing, but Miller decided
that she wanted to play in
the Big East. She nar-

Hat

Reinventing the classic.

Their name comes from a
famous Abbott and Costello
sketch that the father figure of
the group, David White, often
held up to the players
because of its structured clas-
sic'comedy principles. The
Susquehanna Hat Company
remains on the edge of the
‘Burgh comedy circuit
because at heart, they’re tra-
ditionalists. “We’re more like
vaudeville,” said White. The
Really Big Show at Luciano’s
this weekend will showcase
their special brand of comedy
blogurt.

The idea for a new improv
group had been surfacing for
a while, but the concrete was
never poured before April 28,
1994. The Susquehanna Hat
Company began as a formal-
ized spinoff of Friday Night
lmprovs. David Fielding, a Pitt
MFA and the floating green
head of Zordon on the Mighty
Morphin Power Rangers (hon-
est), returned from California
with the intention of forming
an improv group locally. He
left the nationally renowned
improv troupe L.A. Connection
and found a wealth of talent in
the.core group of FNI.

White said, ‘‘It started with
FNl workshop. The core group
of the workshops became the
Susquehanna Hat Co.”

Currentlythe troupe has 12
apostles to the god of come-
dy, but each week remains
fresh because it’s rare that all
will be present at the same
show. “|t’s very much an
ensemble production,”
explained member Michael
Hartnett. A

The show consists of zany
improvisational games and
sketches including “Tagline,”

’ “Genre Jump” and, my per-

  
  

sonal favorite,
“Three-Minute
Musical.” The latter
was descnbed by
member Amanda
Cohen as “the neu-
tron‘ bomb set ender.”
The performers
receive the name of a
musical along with
some key elements
and improvise their own timed
spin of it, usually in opera
style (straight singing). “The
challenge is to not go with
what you’ve done before,”
says Cohen.

“The shows are 60 percent
improv, but we’re trying to
branch out with sketches,”
said Hartnett. White’s

Attractions Cafe in Brentwood,
corporate Christmas parties
and Luciano’s. The group per-

the group. “4H contacted us

Stein. Cohen found the

added that the
sketches are “gener-
al plot lines, without a lot
of scripting.” Member Louis
Stein said this is done in order
to “keep things fresh."

The Hatheads -— that's what
their cult-like following is
affectionately referred to —
have followed them from their
debut at the Funny Bone East,

   
 
 

“We're confident in our flexibil-
ity,” said Stein.

This March, the
Susquehanna Hat Company
will be holding a workshop for

Hartnett said. ‘‘It

confidence builder.”

Recent discussion began .

about audition possibilities for
the group. Interested people
are invited to come to watch
rehearsals, see Friday Night
lmprovs and attend the FNl
workshops. There is a dire
need to keep fresh blood in
the group. When asked what
type of blood they’re looking
for, a plethora of suggestions
emerged from the Green
Room. .

“An open-ended sense of
humor,” suggested Stein.
“You’ve got to be funny, and
you have no idea what the set
will be like until five minutes
beforehand. You can’t turn
down a suggestion from the
audience. A non-politically
correct quality to do that.”

Cohen continued along
those lines: “A sense of humor
is just that — a sense. There
needs to be a willingness to

A let go a take a risk.”

White suggested a need for
“people who work well with us

.[thereby] adding to the group.

We're not a group of stand-up
comics.”

Hartnett agreed that the per-
son doesn’t necessarily
always have to have a one-
liner. “Someone who can cre-
ate interesting characters 
jokes come out of that.”

Steve Werber, wrestling
fanatic, will be hosting this
Saturday’s The Really Big
Show at Luciano’s beginning
at 11 p.m. The Susquehanna
Hat Company will be perform-
ing every other Saturday night
at this venue indefinitely.
Tickets are $3 at the door, or

To Live -
Written by Yu Hua and Lu Wei
Based on Hua’s novel “Lifetimes”
Directed by Zhang Yimou
Starring Ge You and Gong Li

Watching how many devastations
the Xu family faces in To Live may
cause a knot to form in your stomach.
Their lives have been turned upside
down by Mao's Great Leap Forward,
and we see the impossibilities of being
removed from its grip. (Wedding gifts
in this small village are either Mao's
written works or a large charming pic-
ture of the man himself.) Regardless of
how many times this family is pulled
apart physically, their spirits can never
be separated.

With his most recent film, director
Zhang Yimou shows exactly why he is
a two-time Academy Award nominee.
To Live follows the Xu family experi-
ences from the 19403 — when they
were distinguished, well-off individuals
——- to the later years (19503-1960s)
during the upheaval of China by
Chairman Mao's communist forces
when the family lost its high society
status and was forced to live day to
day, just getting by.

As this film opens depicting a kind of
Chinese Las Vegas of the ‘40s, there
is a feeling of darkness lingering some-
where, a smoky cast over the glam-
orous establishment. At his usual table
the classy Xu Fugui rolls the dice for
the umpteenth time, hoping to cancel
out one of his already seven or eight
full pages of debts. As thefilm pro-
gresses, there seems to be a dark
cloud hovering over the small village in
northern China. This dark cloud is the
emergence of communism.

As gambling is regular for Fugui, so

are feelings of frustration and neglect
for his beautiful, pregnant wife Jiazhen
(Gong Li) and their young daughter
Fengxia. When the soft-spoken
Jiazhen asks her husband to choose
— gambling or his family — his silence
answers her question. She says, “-All I
ask is a quiet life together.” Together
with -her family, of course.

Yimou’s camera follows Fugui’s evo-
lution as one who once had a mixed-

' up idea of what was truly important, to

someone who, because of Mao's revo-
lution, realizes that nothing is stronger
or more important than one’s family.
Being separated from his wife and chil-
dren while trying to make a living as a
puppeteer, Fugui is forced to see that
theworld created by Mao has affected
everyone.

Yimou’s intense representation of
the communist revolution is incredibly
powerful, so powerful that it bugged a

few Chinese bigwigs into not allowing A

him to make films in China with foreign
financing for two years. Yimou over-
whelms us with the massiveness of
communism. He creates disturbing
images of just how suffocating
Chairman Mao's forces are: in the
streets are hundreds of red flags, gun-
bearing soldiers and writings covering
the village walls saying, “The working
class leads us all.” The Communist
bulldozer tramples over everybody,
and Yimou shows who exactly gets
plowed.

To Live is about why it is sometimes
easier not to cause any waves on an
apparently still ocean. In other words, it
is sometimes necessary to forget the
past and learn to accommodate.
Although the fierceness of communism
is excellently displayed, the actual sort-
ing through of all the complex issues
off screen was a bit confusing for me.
The ‘movie seemed most real when
Yimou focused on the common people
and made the individuals reach out
from within the fist of communism,

AT A THEATRE NEAR YOU

Seinfeld
Thursday 9 p.m.
NBC

The Simpsons
Sunday 8 p.m.
FOX

Situation comedies are
some of the most worthless
pieces of junk on TV. But, as
somewhat of a defense,
they’re also usually the hard-
est things to create because in
real life people just aren’t that
funny. We don’t have witty
retorts to every comment, we
don’t have crazy situations

happening every week and we _

don’t have a laugh track
behind us. To make things
worse, most comedies can be
categorized into only two
basic types — the family and
the friends.

The family situation — either
the married couple or parents
and children — invariably suf-
fers from the cute disease, a
scene ending with ya puzzled
look of one cast member and
the hysteria of the others, pies
in the face, etc. (see Full
House, Family Matters,
Home Improvement). On the
other hand, the friends idea —
usually four people, three one
sex, one the other —— focuses

on unrealistic situations not
involving anything even
remotely close to real life (see
Fﬁends,EHen)

There are shows that put a
Spin on the idea, like Frasier
and The Larry Sanders
Show, but don’t hold your
breath if you think there’s a
real future in something differ-
ent (it’s the nature of TV).

For the time being, the two
shows that use the half-hour
comedy format to its best pos-
sibility are The Simpsons and
Seinfeld, two long—running
shows that focus on the
humor of real life and its vari-
ous aberrations.

The FOX network is well
known for its off-beat ideas
and left-of-center shows, but
they usually go much too far
overboard. The Simpsons,
though, are allowed to do just

’ that because not only are they

a fake TV family, but they’re a
cartoon (cartoons aren’t real,
people). The show plays off
the stereotypes of society,
white trash brought to life, and
the pop-culture crazed

America that recognizes tele-
vision and movie references
more than their own family
(“What’s your favorite Brady
Bunch episode?”).

Bart, the troubled son, found

 

  

his way onto T-shirts even as
he ridiculed those who chose
to wear them (see also

Beavis and Butthead),
Homer, the incompetent
father, is a drunk and Marge,
the co-dependent wife, has lit-
tle voice in the family save
constant nagging. Yet this
dysfunctional family is what
America is all about.

- The voice actors on the
show are top-notch, and the
animation is easily passable,
especially for TV standards.
The Simpsons spit on the
comedy family, and come out
on top every time.

After a-slow start, Seinfeld
has "become one of the high-
est rated shows on TV, and it
has done so through its gim-
mick of being about nothing
(what friends usually do). An
average show has the four
main characters, Jerry,
Kramer, George and Elaine,
stand around, make fun of
acquaintances and overreact
to common life situations.
What makes it plausible in a
comedy is that, unlike most
main characters in these
show, Jerry Seinfeld plays a
comedian, and, for the most
part, comedians are funny.‘

****Midnight film V

contains scenes of

a graphic sexual
nature.

 

February 9 1995,

The viewer never has to
question his humorous quali-
ty as one might have to with
a TV handy-man or a police
officer.

The show also regularly
pokes fun at embarrassing
and touchy subjects. One,
“The Contest,” was about
who could refrain from mas-
turbating for the longest time,
and another found Jerry and
George trying to convince
people that they weren't a.
gay couple. Jerking off and
being gay aren’t normal
ideas, but these shows were
two of the best.

The acting, except for

' Jerry, is good, if not a little

overdone, and the writers
have come up with easily rec-

A ognizable characters and
‘ bizarre situations that offset

any major problems the show
might have. This season
Seinfeld has been criticized
for not being as funny or dar-
ing as in years past, but now
halfway through its season, it
looks as if the wrongs have
been corrected.

Comedies are the tame,
non-offensive part of televi-
sion, and it's good to se_e that
there are still shows out there
that make you laugh through

the pure shock of seeing»

some things said on TV and

The Pitt News, Thursday, February 9, 1995 -  I A ' 9

   
      

Carmen thinks Antigua is like King Solomon... .David says "Huh?"

When you look at Romeo and Juliet for what it really is, you could get sick to your plete understanding of what you see, just act like you know because there’s no compar- '

stomach. I know I sure did when I read it! It is a ﬁctional, hopeless, confusing horror ison between a real man and a fake story, no disrespect to you Mr. Saliba. Honestly, this

story full of ignorance, prejudice, jealousy, violence and suicidal ten-
dencies. It’s a made-up story, so there is no truth in it. And the main
characters kill themselves and others so there is not any life in it.

Now if there is no truth, no life and no light in this play, then it is
safe to’ say that there is no LOVE in this play.

Unfortunately, I have never had the pleasure to have a long conver-
sation with Orlando [Antigua] because I honestly could not keep my

composure together for any length of time when I was ever close to ‘

him. All I could do is say “Hi” or sometimes I could not even form
words, so then I’d just wave with myhand. I wish that I was as strong
then as I am now writing this letter to The Pitt News! Until recently my
mind played tricks on me in the worst way when it came to Orlando.
One thing that I could pick up on though, just being in his presence
was lots of positive energy. It’s nothing like being caught up in a

Shakespearean tragedy, but more like being in the mix of a gospel ‘

song. Orlando is nothing like Romeo, but more like King Solomon.

' When I look at Orlando all I see is life, the truth and love, just like

Romeo and Juliet mess has brought out the Christian in me, and I.

thank God for that! Orlando, maybe one Sunday we can go to church
together. .
Love and Peace!
Carmen Harris

Ms. Harris,
Your letter was one of the nicest I have received and one full of posi-

. tive emotion, but I must say that I am dumbfounded and quite unsure

as how to answer you.

I understand completely your comparison to Romeo and Juliet, King
Solomon andlthe Bible, and though many feel Orlando is a magnifi-
cent player you have gone a bit overboard.

Maybe Orlando is full of truth, light, life and love, but I don’t see how
that relates to basketball. Honestly, I feel like a third wheel in what
seems to be a letter from you to Orlando.

I would imagine that in the near future, you will go to abasketball

King Solomon, who God richly blessed. All the believers know what I’m trying to say, game and watch King Orlando, and in many ways ﬁnd the positive nature in his game
and all the non-believers can find out by getting a Holy_Bible, and reading the Song of that you do. As for me, I will watch as you do, and until the Epiphany is before my
Songs or Solomon's song found in between Ecclesiastes and Isaiah. _ 4 eyes, I remain, as always, Doubting Thomas. b

This is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. This and all the other .
books in the Bible are a testament of real love. Please, even if you don’t have a com- — David Saliba, senior staff writer

The two teams then traded
runs. First, it was Pitt scoring
seven points in a row, making
it 51-34. Georgetown then
countered by scoring seven of
their own to make it 51-41.
The Lady Panthers knocked
down eight straight points on
hoops by Petho and Fornadel,
taking the lead to 59-43.

“Anytime you can get equal
scoring inside and outside it
helps [everybody],” said
Petho. “We got a lot of open
outside shots and tonight they
happened to be falling.”

Georgetown made another
late run, but it was not

the key as the end of the game
neared. Pitt ended the game
shooting 68 percent, knocking
down 23 of 34 attempts.

“We really had to get back
in the win column,” said
Petho. “We really needed that
for the upcoming stretch of
games we have.”

and Georgetown.
“I thought about
Georgetown, but I kind of knew

where I was going from the
beginning. I wanted to stay
close to home,” Miller said.
“Pitt was the best school around
and I don’t think -that I could
have made it far away. I’ve had
enough trouble adjusting as it
is.’’

Despite the fact that she had
been playing scholastic ball
right next door from Pitt while
at Oakland Catholic, she found
the transition from high school
to college extremely difficult.

One of the biggest adjust-
ments was her lack of minutes.
Pitt already had seniors Erin
Maloy and Jill Colabrese at
shooting guard. Miller, the
freshman, spent plenty of time
on the bench.

But for one game last year
against nationally ranked
Connecticut, she showed a
ﬂash of the offensive produc-

tion that made her so highly
recruited. In only eight minutes
of play, she lit up the Huskies
for a career-high 16 points on
five of six shooting.

Miller appeared in 22 games
and averaged 7.1 minutes per
game. She ﬁnished the season
averaging 3.1 points per con-
test.

With her offensive creden-
tials somewhat established,
other aspects of her game need-
ed to be brought to another
level.

“We brought her here to
score,” Bruce said. “She will
always be a great shooter, but
we felt at the end of last year

that she needed to work on

some other areas.”

Miller took Bruce’s advice
and spent the summer working
on her game. Improving her
quickness and defense were her
primary goals. She played in a-
women’s summer league at

hours at the gym shooting. The
results of her hard work are evi-
dent this season on the court.

Especially on the defensive
end.

“Defense is always the
toughest, thing to teach to a
young player,” Bruce said.
“Her defense has really
improved.”

Miller found that in college,
unlike high school, everyone
can score on any given night.

“In high school you knew
that each team had only one or
two players that you had to
worry about,” she said.
“Everyone can hurt you now.
You have to want to play
defense.”

But while her defense has
been solid, the offensive end
has been another story. Her
high point total this year, which
came against Seton Hall, is
only six.

“We’re all in a fog about it
right now,” Bruce said. “I don’t
think that there is anything that
we need to say. It’s just a men-
tal block.”

As far as Miller knows, noth-
ing is wrong mechanically with
her shot, despite some fatherly
advice from her dad, James.

“My parents come to all the
games,” she said. “My dad has
told me my follow-through is
crooked and that I’m not using
my legs.” -.

Miller says that she has lis-
tened to everyone’s advice and
has even tried some of their
solutions, but feels that there is
only one way to get out of her
slump.

“I’m going to have to shoot
n1ore,” she said. “I’m going to
go and shoot on Tuesdays and
Thursdays when I don’t have
class.”

“This is the worst slump I’ve
ever had and I’m going to break
out of it. They still have faith in
me,” she said.” Coach still says
that I have the green light.”

In the meantime, Miller has
been concentrating on other
things.

The Pitt News,-Thursday, February 9, 1995

Lewandowski

‘From page 8

results for Lewandowski did not
change here at Pitt. She has
qualified for the NCAA
Tournament in each of her first
two seasons, with dreams of
doing the same this season.

“I really hope that I will quali-
fy for the NCAA Tournament
again this year,” she said. “I did
really lousy my freshman year at
the NCAA Tournament. Last
year I performed a lot better.”

In the NCAA Tournament last
season _ in Indianapolis,
Lewandowski became an All-
American in all three events that
she competed in. Overall, she
finished ninth in the l-meter-
competition, l4th on the 3-meter
board and 10th in platform div-
ing.

Lewandowski’s performance-

'at the NCAAS earned her a berth ’

in the Senior Nationals. This is a
competition that is held for
America’s top 35 divers. This
includes collegiate and non-col-
legiate athletes. She made the
ﬁnals in this competition on her
favorite board —_— the 3-meter.

“Three-meter is my favorite
event,” said Lewandowski. “I
tend to train for the 3-meter
board 90 percent of the time.
The only time that I practice the
l-meter board is when I have to
in practice. I find the 1-meter
board to be less exciting than the
other events.”

Just as with any other
Division I athlete, the sport that
she plays consumes_her life
when the sport is in season. The
Pitt diving team practices every
day at 6 a.m. and also in the
afternoon. Practicing every day
along with keeping up with
school can make any person’s
life a frenzy.

“Diving consumes a lot of my
time,” said Lewandowski. “A
usual day for me is hectic. I
have to wake-up at 5:30 every
morning for practice. I then go
to classes all day. Then it is off
to practice once again. By the
time I get back it is after 7. By
the time I get done eating dinner
and studying, it is 2 in the

“Many people help me get
through the day. My roommate
and fellow swimmer Chrissy
DiLeonardo is a big help. So is
[freshman swimmer] Courtney
Sunseri. She really makes me
laugh in the pool.”

“Sunday’s personality is sort
of care-free. People carmot tell
how motivated she really is. She
has a great desire to go far in
diving,” said DiLeonardo.

By just talking to 16-year div-
ing coach Julian Krug for two
minutes about Lewandowski,
you could tell how special she
is.’ Krug E has coached

Lewandowski throughout high .

school and now in college.
“Sunday’s progress has been
consistent,” said Krug. “In most
cases, the diver will have a
plateau with their progress after
a certain period. Sunday contin-
ues to get better with time. I
have had the pleasure of work-
ing with this talent. Sunday is a
very different type of athlete.
“Before a meet she will get

nervous. In most athletes, this
will be their demise. Sunday
somehow channels this energy
and uses it positively.”

“Julian is one of the best
coaches in the nation. He really
helps me out a lot,” said
Lewandowski. “He knows me
and he knows what I ﬁnd difﬁ-
cult. I owe a lot of my credit to
him.”

“Sunday is the best diver out
of the University of Pittsburgh
since Karen LaFace,” said Krug.
“LaFace continued her diving
career after Pitt in the Olympics.
Sunday has a conceivable shot
at the Olympics also.” ’

“My diving is the strongest
that it has ever been,” said
Lewandowski. “I need to place
in the top eight in the Senior
Nationals to get on the national
team. This is the step before the
Olympics. The Olympics are a
one—shot try. If you have a bad
day on the board, your chance is
over and you have -to wait
another four years for the next
chance.”

than 150 other students descended
from the stands within minutes.

With the second half waiting to
begin, school oﬁcials tried speak-
ing with the students who were
protesting while the other part of
the sellout crowd shouted to those
on the court to get off.

Obviously the protestors knew
that by holding a demonstration
during a game against the fourth-
ranked UMass team, that national
attention would be theirs by the
time ESPN started their 11 p.m.
“SportsCenter.”

The goal was to be heard, to
confront their president, but
Lawrence was not in attendance.
The point that the students wanted

   

APTMENTS -AVAILABLE

to make is indisputable. They
have every right to protest and
their reasons were 100 percent
correct But the way they went
about it alienated their own
school, their team.

What about the fans who paid
to see these teams play? More
importantly, the fans, old and
young, who were watching their
team beat the fourth-ranked
Minutemen, what about them?

The Scarlet Knight basketball
team, waiting to take their lead
into the second half, excited at the
possibility of victory, then heart-
break The hard practices and
work of these two teams. Players
on scholarship, missing classes
and sacriﬁcing to play one anoth-
er. Some with hopes of pursuing
professional careers, and some
hoping to beat a fourth-ranked
team.

It is a snowball effect that came
straight from the mouth of
Lawrence. Hopefully, the students
of Rutgers will protest the presi-
dent’s office, blocka street on

Her rebounds, assists and
blocks this year have already
surpassed last year’s totals for
the entire season.

“She has become a very smart
player,” Bruce said.” Her scor-
ing may be a little down, but she
has improved in almost every
other area of her game.

“She’s very versatile. She’s a
good passer and she can handle
the ball real well.”

One teammate is even sur-
prised that Miller mentioned the
word “slump.”

“I don’t think that she’s in a
slump,” point guard Carol
Morton said. “She thinks that
she is. She has been doing a lot
of other things. She has shown
everyone just how talented she
really is.” ,

Miller hopes that she will

‘ break out soon and give the
slumping Lady Panthers the
shot in the arm that they need to
get back on track.

“She’s playing with a lot of
confidence,” Bruce said. “I

~ think that she is ready to come
on strong. We’re expecting her
to be a mainstay for us this year
and the next.” '

The demonstration at the game
.. was peaceful, which is a tribute to I
the students, but it may have

V proven to be better if they eventu- S in

seats .or even leaving the arena if . ,
that proved to be more effective.
What itboils down to is a dis-
grace. There really is no way to Q
’ comment on a protest that has
evolved from such a spectacle.
Because of the naive remarks of a
so—tl1ought-of leader, Lawrence
has caused a trickle-down effect
starting with a deep-rooted prob-
lem of racism. V A p
The actions of this man have
brought chaos to a campus that

Sad isn’t it?
