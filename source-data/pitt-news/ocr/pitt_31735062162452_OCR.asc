registration. It was held in the
Cathedral of Learning for the ﬁrst
time.‘The room-242 C1.——was too

2.Sensible arrangements were
not made concerning the days
for registering. Too many stu-

resulted in the second largest

The largest came in one of ‘the’

Along with this, officials said,
special groups, had to be regist-
ered the ﬁrst day. Such as the
football team, the band, the glee
club and the monitors for the
office of the Dean of Women.

3. The line for pictureswas one
of the main faults. Officials said
they “will study this situation
closely" to ﬁnd out “if pictures
are actually needed” and if so,
“why they must be taken on the

lmltingr Trimester Problems

History was made here yesterday. After 172 years the

‘ T university has switched to the trimester system of education.

It is a challenging experiment and program that Chan-

licellor Litchﬁeld has initiated. Many curious groups will
Watch the progress of the system. There are the educators

throughout the nation who are interested in seeing how

If it has a successful beginning here, the plan may be

 ‘ ,'Another curious group is the surrounding, community.

Included in this segment of the interested are many persons
fjwho are, ready to pounce on the university administration,
Xlwith strong emphasis on the chancellor, when the ﬁrst

noticeable ‘problem arises.

Perhaps the most _curious of all are the students who
are the guinea pigs in this experiment. And perhaps they

‘ ,_ are alsothe most bewildered about it all.

_ They know they had to return to‘ school. two weeks
earlier than usual; they know they will be unable to write

._.‘'their term papers during Christmas vacation; and those who
are seniors know they will graduate eight weeks earlier
»_than any previous senior class at Pitt. A ‘

_Past these points, though, no one is too certain what

‘All the pamphlets describing the system say it will,

._.;enable a student to complete his college education in a
shorter time at the same cost, obtain graduate or profes-

sional training sooner and begin his career at an earlierage.

But just exactly what will take place during the next
15 or 30 or 45 weeks, if anything different from previous
years, is unknown. ' _ A
One fact appears inevitable. Mistakes will be made.
Weﬁnd it impossible to be so optimistic about the program

to say anything different.

However, we are of the opinion that when something
does- go amiss, it must be treated correctly. Students must
not immediately become angry and harangue the admini-

, stration with violent criticism, as they have done in the past.

The administration, on the other hand, must not be
afraid to admit that something has gone wrong. They must
accept constructive criticism without themselves complain-

 ing. Then, they must correct the problem as quickly and
 as efficiently as possible.

As for us, we look forward to the coming weeks with
great interest — interest in what happens, interest in what
problems will arise and interest in how these problems
will be solved. ‘ ‘

Captain, Tom Goes West . . .

The   ‘Best’ Bo
By Murray Chass

There’s an empty oﬂice on the second ﬂoor of
the Field House these days. It’s the first time in
a decade that it is empty. '

And there’s a big empty chair? in that empty
office. The office will be ﬁlled very shortly, within
a week perhaps. But that chair .
may remain empty for a long '
time. '

Both the ofﬁce and the chair
belonged to* Tom Hamilton.
Hamilton ‘left Pitt this summer
to go to the West Coast and the p 
Far West Five. He took the posi- 
tion of executive oﬂicer of the 
conference which includes
U C L A, California, Southern
California, Washington and

’ Stanford. ' .

When Hamilton departed at the beginning of
August, he left a void here. For Captain Tom,

’ with no qualiﬁcations whatsoever, is the «best
— athletic executive in the nation. '

Reputation Known
This is not one man’s opinion alone. Wherever

one may travel, he would find the name and repu— -,_-

tation' of the captain are well known in athletic
circles. \ . C
Any follower of Pitt sports knows what Hamil-
ton did for this university in intercollegiate ath-
letics. He returned the Golden Panthers to the
national football spotlight. He displayed his ver-
satility by stepping in as interim headfootball
coach twice, and both times did a good job.

- During his ten years as athletic director, two
football teams, two basketball teams and two base-
ball teams competed: in post-season play. Four
major sports -7- wrestling, gymnastics, soccer and

squash, — were added to the varsity intercollegiate

program. _ V
The captain, however,‘ did not stop‘ at estab-

’ lishing one of the most outstandingintercollegiate
programs in the country. Much of his devotion and -

struggles lay in his work toward a topnotch physi-
cal education program for university students.
Personal Plan Defeated .

One of his more personal defeats came when
his plan for increasing the physical education re-

quirement from one to two years was rejected ,by

the faculty.» Perhaps this rejection was -as much

of a factorin hisleaving as any other differences‘

he had with the chancellor and the administration.

These Changing Times . . .

‘disciplinary lectures from him.

 

Ws Out  

Only a few weeks ago, Chancellor Litchﬁeld
announced a new program for physical education.
The new athletic director will serve as chairman
of the phys ed department. The quality of the in-
struction of the department will be increased, en-
abling students to gain more from the classes.
Physical education will be put on the same level
as intercollegiate athletics and will receive as much
emphasis. . n

V Was this not one of the goals of Captain Hamil-
ton? But this program was announced after the
man surely responsible for it ha_d departed. ‘And
he received no credit for it. ,‘ . =
While at Pitt, Hamilton stood for no wavering
from the straight path by the athletes. There are
many athletes playing now who have received
Most of them
always were the better for it. , V V
Why did Tom Hamilton leave Pitt? Only he
can furnish that story. However, there are two
apparent reasons. There were differences between
him and Chancellor Litchﬁeld that could not be re-
solved, no matter how -long ‘and how hard‘they
might have tried. Perhaps one of the participants
in this feud was not interested in --settling the

differences. I A .

Policy Views Incompatible , .

This feud was denied repeatedly by both men.

‘This is only ‘natural, however.

It appeared to be a matter of two administra-
tors, _both outstanding ’in their ﬁelds, notlbeing
able to meet on policy. — . '

One other reason forhis leaving is this.
tain Hamilton has worked diligentlyon the crea-

’- tion of a continental college football Lponference.

The schoolslwhich make up the conference he now
heads probably would be _members ‘of the new
group." ' , V

Thus, Hamilton remains in a "position where
he can work’ on the new conference. Also, and this
.may be most important, the_post he accepted on
the West Coast could be a stepping stone to the
commissionership of the forthcoming league.

Before Captain Tom departedghe sent a letter
to ‘this writer. Part of it follows:

“I hope . .

' This climb willcontinue, but that-chair may
still remain empty. ’ '

Progress, Brings Confusion  

By Deborah Willson

Things don’t seem quite thesame around here,‘

anymore. It certainly never can be saidthat noth-

ing ever happens at Pitt — ‘not with all the _new

projects and programs present and predicted by
, .

’ the university.

One of the biggest things around is the new

_ dorm program. Did you realize ,

the numberof resident students V
is more than three times that
of 1957? ..
The Schenley Quadrangle A
really is humming these days, 
what with the boys in McCor- .i

mick Hall busily assembling
binoculars, everyone shouting
from dorm to dorm and gaily
tramping through the ﬂower 
beds. 

Schenley Hall has its share I
of excitement, too. They even caught a prowler
there last week. It seems one freshman strolled
into his room and found a strange man using his
electric razor. Figuring this character for merely
another eccentric upperclassman, the poor frosh
said, “Excuse me,” and left. The police appre-
hended the intruder later.

Look Alikes . -

The girls’ dorm people have their share of
headaches, too. Girls are getting lost by t.heir
house mothers right and left —- all those buildings
look alike somehow.

One girl — a freshman naturally — lived alone
for alweek in a big apartment in Building B before
she accidentally ran into her housemother ‘at a

party. It seems someone ‘forgot to‘ tell her that her.

room assignment had been changed from Building
“B” to “A.”

And speaking of confusion, how about that cir-

cus in the Cathedral last Wednesday? But maybe
the less said the better. Students, as well as ad-
ministrators were to blame, and improvements are
sure to be made on_the system. ‘ i

 

go-wrong" until you try. At least the freshmen got

through registration on Friday without much‘ diffi-

culty. The upperclassmen are used to confusion,

but new students need to be “broken in” gradually.

Creativity Blossoms

_ Of course, we rnusn’t forget thenew publica-
tions otﬁces in Schenley Hall on the fourth ﬂoor.
Thefemale members of the staffs ‘are going wild‘
with theopportunity to do a little decorating. It
will be a miracle if all publications come outon

schedule not paint-stained, or at least with a little »

turpentinejspilled ‘ on ‘them.

As" for the biggest project of general interest, I

«the prize for that undoubtedly would go to the
-‘new bookstore. If only thelworkmen would refrain
from using those tremendous pneumatic drills or
whatever they are until at least 10 a.m., the dorm
students would be a lot happier. Oh well, that’s
the price you pay for progress. i

That bookstore will be quite the improvement,
too. Maybe some of the older students look back
with faint nostalgia on the crowded days when
they deperately tried to ge their slips of paper ‘to
the clerk first. At least you met interesting people
in those lines. Somehow that struggle for books
is part of “college life.” i "C
Books In A Basket? _ .

At any rate, the new store will be less crowded
because of the increased space and the ‘.‘supermar-
ket System” easier on the clerks. “Supermarket
system” is a bad choice of term, though-, don’t you
think? Sounds too commercial for a university
bookstore. Actually, this system is more like the
old kind ’of bookstore where you ‘could go, and
spend hours browsing around. That way you ﬁnd
books you never heard of and probably never
would have read otherwise. -

Some people have criticized-the plan of allow-
ing the bookstore to'be a “part of the..communit.y”
also. They seem to feel a university should be ex-
clusive. That seems a little exaggerated though.
"After all the university is. part of the community
andmaybe we can educatea‘ "few more people that
.way,_, , . . ‘ . - .

.Unlike previous years the uni-

versity was unable touse the Sy-

ria Mosque, which_ was rented out
to a convention. Thus, the com-

Plete registration process was con— .

ducted‘ in the Cathedral of Learn-

.» ing.

-. Progress was greatly hamper-
ed by long lines and other bot-
tlenecks. The congestion in the
registration areas, chieﬂy the
Commons-\ Room, resulted in
much confusion. Students poll-
ed were unanimous in com-
menting this was the longest
and most confusing registra-
tion they had gone through.

There.‘ were three major cate-
gories of complaints,_a11 of which

, S were both cause and effect of the

x’ n .- congestion.

Criticize Clear Cards
A‘ great- many. students criticiz-

'ed the ﬁrst step in registration——

that of picking up their small

white “clear” cards, which indi-
pp cated whether or not their rec-
ords were cleared. Because of the
long lines, it took many as much
as one hour to pick up these cards.

. Josephine King, Ed. ’60, sug-

l)!‘ gested that mailing the clear

cards would have cut down" a

great deal of the waiting time.
Liberal arts students suffered

the greatest inconvenience be-
cause of this ﬁrst phase. The
room to which they had to report
was small and had only one en-
trance. " '

l""’{;.’ Room Too Small
_-'-' Lee Noble, Arts ’60, voiced the

opinion of all the students waiting
their. turn in‘ the congested hall-
way outside 242 C1. when he sug-

'gested' that a bigger room -with

more -than one entrance would

have. faciltated the ﬂow of trafﬁc. 

'MariIy"n McAdams, Don Mc-
-Pherson’ and Bob White Vwere A
among the unfortunate liberal
arts students. who, after stand-
ing in line for one hour to get
their clear cards, were shut out
of the room just as they reached
the door because of the lunch
break. _ .

“They should -have had a second
shift take over during the lunch
hour to handle the people waiting
outside so long,” they agreed
White predicted increased con—
gestion would "result when the
left-over morning standees would

' be joined by those with alternoon
«appointments.

Commons Room Jammed

A second category of complaints
concerned the lack of enough fa-
cilities in the Commons Room for
ﬁlling out cards. At times when
the tables designated for this pro-
cess were jammed, many students
had to resort to sitting on the ‘floor
near the wrought—iron entrance

"inorder to ﬁll out their cards.

The aisles between the tables
were too narrow and created an-
other bottleneck in the Commons
Room.

The ﬁnal major complaint
-was the amount of time it took
to get cards checked. Ironically
many students complained that
the checkers were being too
eff.’.cient and too slow in per-
forming their checking duties.

This caused a great bottleneck
at that end of the room. At times
the lines of students waiting in
front of the eight checkers
stretched one-fourth the length of

for use of Syria Mosque,” one
said.’ “Also, there was a hard.
/ rain during part of registration
on Wednesday’ and having
everything held in the Cath-
edral saved students from get-
ting soaked.”
A As for,pre—registration, officials
‘said it was -“reasonably success-
ful.” V ~ ‘

“Some counselors didn’t under-
stand what they were supposed
to do,” one of them said. Maybe
they didn’t take the care they
should have’. But the students also
were at fault. Some of them didn’t
do things. they were supposed to.
Not all of them pre—registered.”

One official said pre-registra-
tion will be extended in the fu-
ture, thus eliminating the regular
registration. .

“I am willing to predict that

this past registration is the last
one at Pitt,” he said. “Pre—regis-.

tration will knock out these ‘

massive registrations.

“Perhaps I am saying this too-

soon, but I think sometime in the
near‘ future, students will be able
to go straight into classes when
they return to school without go-
ing through registration.”

A unique complaint by John
Kish, Bus. Ad. ’62, was that there
were not enough signs. He was
delayed quite a bit by not know-

.ing which room was (lcsignatecl

Bernard Kerns, Arts '60, re-
marked that pre-registration
was wasted on him. Last spring‘
he ﬁlled out his study list, ex-
plaining that he wantcsl only
evening classes. He received all
day classes.

. “Changing all my class cards
really slowed me up, not to men-
tion the long lines,” he said.

Appointments
Made to Staff .
in 3 Divisions

Three new appointments to the
university staff have been made.

Dr. Leon Reid has been named
associate professor in the school
of education. Dr. Robert W. Avery
has been appointed senior re-
search associate in the Admini-
strative Science Center
sistant professor in the depart-
ment of sociology\ and Hazel
,Marie Johnson will take the post
of reference librarian.

Dr Reid has been assistant and
coordinator of special education
at the University of Virginia since
1956. He has also held teaching
and research positions with the
Uiiiiiersity of Texas and with the
Austin, Texas, Cerebral Palsy
Center. _ ‘

Dr. Avery comes here from the
staff of the School of Industrial
Management, Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology," where he has
been engaged in research in in-
dustrial organization for research
and‘ development activities. He
also has studied career plans of

and as-

.business and enginering students.

The tax board ruled last week
that Pitt must pay about $41,000
in taxes on the ball park. ‘ _
Chancellor Litchfield’s resi-
dence at Beechwood Boulevard
was assessed at $45,000. Wild-
wood in Hampton Township
" has been assessed at $115,680.
The case of Forbes Field came
before the Board of Assessors as
a routine matter because there
was a change of ownership. Pitt
claimed the rent money from the _

He noted that the ﬁeld is leas-
ed to the Pirates ‘until 1963 and
may not be used, under any
terms ,of that lease, for any
other purpose without the Pi-. *
rates’ approval.

Forbes Field, acquired from the

   Sophomores Help Solve:

 Problems for Coaches

_ By TED COLTON ' '
There are many gaps to ﬁll "in the 1959 ‘edition of the
Panther gridders and Coach John Michelosen has just ten

more days before the opener t

0 do it.

The Panthers have been practicing in 90-degree heat for
the past two weeks at the Allequippa Street ﬁeld across

from the Field House. 9

The Blue and Gold will face
their traditionally rugged sched-
Jlewhlch opens with Marquette
on Sept. 19 at Milwaukee. Seven-
teen lettetmen will be returning
from last year’s squad which
posted a 5-4-1 record. _

Gap Left in Line -

Michelosen’s biggest problem
this year will be replacing the
stellar performers he lost from-
the middle of the line through
_::rac‘.uation.

‘Such men as All-American
John Guzik, -Don Crafton and
Ed Michaels will have tobe re-
placed by sophomores or up-
per classmen’who saw little or
no action last year.

Among the sophomores who are
expected to fill the vacancies are
Larry Vignali, Regis Coustillac
and Andy Kuzneski. Lettermen
returning at center and guard
are Serafino Fazio, Norton, Sea-
man, Henry Suffoletta and Bob
Longfellow.

Need Quarterback

Another problem the Panthers
will face this year is ﬁnding a
capable replacement for Ed Sha-
rockman who dropped out of
school last spring, leaving Ivan
Toncic as the only experienced
signal-caller. '

So far John Sakal has been
.running with the “B” unit and
looks like the man who could
spell of! Toncic. However. Pete
Prince, Ed Clark and Dave
Kraus still have a chance to
beat out Sakal.

The Panthers do, however, ap-

pear strong at tackles and in the
backﬁeld. Four lettermen are re-
turning at the tackle positions
and two at each backﬁeld position
with the exception of quarter-
back.
Many Backs Back

Although the Panthers lost such
stars as Bill Kaliden, Dick Haley
and Bob Stark from last year’s

equad they still have outstanding.

At the tackle positions co-
captains Ken Montanari and

Mills and Ernie Westwood.

men Bob Rathi and Ron Delﬁne.

Of the~coming season Michel-
osen stated, “Sophomores will
have to help out -in’the middle
of the line and our second team
quarterback must come through.
“Right now we are plagued
with minor injuries especially at
fullback, but they should be ready
to go bylthe opener.” ' ’
Whenasked how well he though
the team would do during the
season he concluded, “We’ll play

experts as a candidate for All-America-n honors at his tackle

position.

The Panthers could be ‘theinumber one team in the

“I think we should be a little better than lastcyear,” the

I boss said. “I expect us to try a’ lot of new formations this

season. I personally think we have a lot more to offer the
fans than Notre Dame, Army -and Navy. I always felt those
boys schools aren’t in the same class with usanyway.” ,

By this time you are wondering if somebody isn’t crazy.
But conﬁdence" is high on theé
Pitt campus about capturing na-
tional honors in 1959.

“Don’t underrate us,” the
coach continued. “We have more
experience, size and speed this
year. We were a little green last
year and that hurt us against
some of our opponents but I
think we still did a better job on
TV, than Army.

“I cannot understand why those

prefer to Watch Army instead of
Pitt. As I said, there are certain
things we have that Army doesn’t.

there is no doubt we are good
enough to go to a bowl. I think
we are as versatile as we were in
1955 and 1956 when we went to
two bowl games and, were good
enough to win the Lambert
Trophy one season.

“Somebody said I should worry

With practice now

By JACK SIVJITII
in full swing in preparation forthe

1959 Soccer season, Coach Leo Bemis is anticipating a good

year for his booters.

“I feel conﬁdent we will improve on last year’s record
(3-7),” Bemis said. “Our defense looks strong and our forward
line has improved enough to give us the scoring punch we

lacked last year.” G

In 1958 the Soccer team scored
only ‘15 goals in 10 games, a

good scoring squad. But with the
nucleus of _players returning, and
with help from last year’s fresh-
men team, the Panthers could
havea winning season.
The ﬁrst game ofthe season
will be with the Blue and Gold’s
perennial rival, Slippery Rock.‘
‘.._‘I don’t expect this will be an
easy season,” Bemis said. “All
the teams have improved.”
“I am asking any boy, with or

.;,.,‘.-without experience, to come out
'5"“fof the team. We have a ‘varsity,

junior varsity, and a freshmen

 ~ team. No one will be cut from the

squad and we feel that this ex-
periencepgained from team play

’ will help some boys to "become
_future varsity stars.”

Two Bowl Bids in Four Years

Usually a football coach is rated
on the number of games his
teams have won, or if he has
had a winning season. In the
case of John Michelosen he seems
to _be faring pretty well.

He has compiled a 23-17-2 re-
cord since becoming Panther
coach in 1955.

In his first year he won seven
and lost four, having decisive vic-
tories over Duke and West Vir-
ginia. This record Earned the Pan-
thers an invitation to the Sugar
Bowl where they dropped a 7-0
decision to.Georgia Tech.

The following year, 1956,
Michelosen turnev‘. in his best"
coaching effort when his Pan-
thers won seven, lost three and

‘ tied one, and went to the Gator

Bowl. But once again they came
out on the short end of the
score, 21-14, again to Georgia
Tech.

The only losing season Mich— 

elosen ‘had was in 1957 when he
won four and lost six. Last year
a 5-4-1 record, in which three
losses were by three points each,
caused him to miss another in-
vitation to a Bowl.

P   Engineering and Mines
  To Assist Chile School

The Schools of Engineering‘and Mines have received a
5 contract from the International Cooperation Administration,
' a.division of the U. S. Department of State, to assist in the

development of technological

and engineering educational

programs at two universities in Chile.
During a visit to Chile earlier this year, Dr, G. Raymond

Fitterer, dean of engineering¢

‘here, talked to many representa-
tives ot industry and education
in the South American nation to
learn ﬁrst hand needs for technic-
a.l_personnel in the Chilean in-
dustries. .
The program submitted by Dr.
Fit-terer to the ICA will include
the formation of an industr_y-edu-
cation advisory board made up of
leaders in those ﬁelds, with the
objective of determining the tech-
nological manpower needs and to
suggest procedures for establish-
ing cooperative educational pro-
grams between the Chilean uni-
versities and the industries. 1
The program also will include
the development ‘of in-plant.
/ , training courses for the develop-
ment of skilled workers as well
as cooperative undergraduate and
graduate programs in engineering.
This should lead ultimately to
the‘ development of many en-
gineering research projects
which will be of, considerable
beneﬁt to the industry in that

. country. ’

I'=/ The university will send a team
of three engineers with their fam-
ilies to Chile for a period of two
to three years. Dr. Leroy F. Stutz-
man, formerly head of the chem-
ical engineering department at

, Northwestern and director of re-

I V . search for Remington-Rand Corp.

at Minneapolis, will lead the

group. -

' The other members are Arnold

”§'L.»Wimer, formerly of H. B. May-
Vinard and C0,, Inc., and Edward
, N.'Thomas, recently employed as

, ﬁeld ‘representative, Bureau Of
Apprenticeship and Training, U.S.

H Department of Labor at Chicago.
 » ~ The two universities in Chile

’ 'gwith which the team will be

‘ State Technical University and

‘ the University of .Santa Maria.

' During the course of the con-

tract, as many as ten C,hi_le~ans, a

sors from Pitt will go to Chile as

Chile is anation of 71/2 million
people whose intellectual ‘poten-
tial is described in Dr. Fitterer’s
report as “much greater than in
many countries in the world.”

Dr. Fitterer was a United
States delegate to the ﬁrst Pan-
American Metallurgical Confer-
ence at Bogota, Columbia, in

1952, ‘and in 1956 was a dele-
-gate to the Second Conference

on Steel Making held at Sao
Paulo, Brazil.

At the time of the Bogata Con- ' '

ference he concluded an agree-
ment which is still in effect with
the University of the Andes to
bring students from that South
American school to receive their
last two years of engineering
training at Pitt. -
