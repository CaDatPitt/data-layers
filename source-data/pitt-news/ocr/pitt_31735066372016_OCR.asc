Killer tornadoes

This was the scene at the Big Beaver Shopping Plaza in Beaver County the day
after a tornado touched down. - T heitomado hit the plaza at approximately 8:20
p.m. last Friday afternoon. In the photo, members of several area ﬁre depart-

victims of the disaster. At the top left of the photo is the Beaver River, where some
debris from various buildings was strewn. Vice-president George Bush visited

Wheatland, another area hard-hit by the tornadoes, yesterday. Bush was accom-
panied by Governor Thornburgh and Federal Emergency Management Agency
head Louis Giuffrida while inspecting the most heavily damaged areas of Whea-
tland. President Reagan has declared four counties in Ohio and 12 in Pennsylva-
nia as federal disaster areas. At least 91 people were killed and thousands of
others were injured when tornadoes roared through Pennsylvania, Ohio, and

Depressiontreated as illness

in research at Wester

By Nancy Quick
Staff Writer

Depression as we currently under-
stand it is really an illness, affecting
one out of every 20 people. Accord-

ing to a National Institute of Mental.

Health survey, depressive illness is
the third most common disease in
the United States, following the
most common illness — anxiety —
and- running closely behind alcohol-
ism and drug abuse.

“Depression is a pervasive lower-

ing of mood, much more severe than A

most of us would imagine,” said Dr.
David Jarret, co-principal investiga-
tor in the Depression Prevention
Study at Western Psychiatric Insti-
tute and Clinic. “The victim feels
helpless, ahopeless, unable to see
beyond the illness.

“I treated a young 21-year-old
male," Dr. Jarret said, ~“who told me
that he could never find the words to
express the feeling of depression to
one who has never suffered from it.
Instead, he painted a picture of a
long, black tunnel. ‘You find your-
self in the middle, where all is dark-
ness,’ the patient explained. ‘You
caih’t see the light at the end, or even
the light behind you. You don't
know how on earth you are going to
get out.’ ”

Depressive illness has both psy-

c h o I o g i c a I
components. V

“Psycliologically, the patient
experiences a general lowering of
mood,”Jarret said. “One of the most
prominent features isguilt. He may
feel that he is no longer pulling his
weight in the family because of his
depressed state. Concentration
drops. Often, the patient cannot_
even concentrate on watching TV or
reading. There can be a loss of
memory. The persistence of this
symptom can be very frightening
because the patient fears that he is
really losing his mind.”

Jarret also pointed out that a
depressed person can experience
retardation. “He looks slowed-
down, and everything seems to be
moving in slow motion. He has diffi-
culty making decisions.”

According to Jarret, the most
talked-about psychological symp-
tom of depression is suicide. “Forty-
five percent of depressive illnesses
include suicide attempts. Fifteen to
25 percent of the attempts are suc-
cessful. The depressed person seems
to withdraw from the outside world,
and his irritability and introspection

and biological

I make it difficult for others to try to

help him," said Jarret.

Jarret also stressed that biological
symptoms are often complained of
before a lowering of mood occurs.
Appetite can either increase or
decrease, causing a gain or loss of

n Psych

weight. Patients sometimes expe-
rience cravings and eat a lot of junk
food. The patient either experiences
difficulty sleeping or increased
sleepiness. Either phenomenon
results in decreased energy, so that
even climbing the stairs can become
a major chore.

Depression is twice as common in
women as in men‘, and it can affect
all age groups, Jarret explained.
Sixty percent of depressive illnesses
occur a second time, and 80 percent
of those occur a third time. In cases
of regularly recurring depression,
very few residual symptoms occur
between episodes, he said.

“Seasonal Affective Disorders,
for example, occur at the same time
each year, lasting for about three
months in the fall and winter, and
resolving in the spring,” Jarret said.
“This type of disorder has always
been attributed to the holiday blahs,
but now it sen‘/,,es as evidence that
there may be different sub-types of
clinical depression.”

Two types of treatment are used
to combat depressive illness: medi-
cation to treat biological symptoms,
and psychotherapy to treat psycho-
logical symptoms.

Pharmacy clean quits,

By Kevin J.‘ Krist
Staff Writer

Due to an “apparent decrease in
commitment” to graduate study and
research, Dr. Lewis Dittert resigned
as dean of the School of Pharmacy.

The decision, according to Dit-
tert, was the result of growing dissat-
isfaction with Provost Roger Ben-
jamin’s proposal for a consolidation
of Health Sciences schools as out-

- lined in Benjamin’s controversial

Five-year Plan. The proposal origi-
nally suggested phasing out the
Pharmacy in‘ his recommendations
designed to lower university operat-
ing costs.

The leadership of the pharmacy
program now falls upon Jerry Coch-
ran, the assistant vice president of

blames 5-year plan

Health Sciences. Cochran will serve
as chairman of an executive commit-
tee composed _of present pharmacy
faculty, including Assistant Dean
David Bergman. Accoding to Coch-
ran, the non-permanent committee
will manage the operations of the
present program.

Dittert has accepted a position at
the University of Kentucky at Lex-
ington as a professor of pharmaceu-
tics and will also conduct research
there.

Dittert said he leaves with no feel-
ing of bitterness toward the present
administration, but hopes that his
resignation will make university
planners more aware of the plight of
the School of Pharmacy and help
shape future considerations in their
commitment to quality education.

Arts festival:
atradition is back

By Karen Frost
Staff Writer

The Three Rivers Arts Festival is
one of Pittsburgh’s biggest summer
events. This year, from June 7 to
June 23, more than 600,000 visitors
will view arts and crafts exhibits,
listen to music, eat different foods
and just enjoy themselves.

Putting together a festival of this
size is no simple task. Nancy Brem,
the festival’s public relations. direc-
tor, said that the planning for this
year’s festival began last summer
and will continue “up to the last
moment.” Entries for art and craft
exhibits are received in the fall. Spe-
cial exhibits, like this year’s Illumi-
nation: The Quality of Light, which
is a city-wide exhibition exploring
“light” as a legitimate means of artis-
tic expression, are scheduled two
and three years in advance.

“The response from artists is over-
whelming,” Brem said. Approxi-
mately 600 artists — 498 artists from

Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, ,

New York, Maryland and Washing-
ton, D.C., along with 55 demon-
strating artists and 52 invited artists
— will participate this year in special
exhibitions and projects.

“Unfortunately, a lot of artists
don’t realize that they must submit
their art so early, and we can’t
include them,” Brem said. “We
make "no exceptions with entry
dates."

Fund raising for the festival also .

begins early. “Fund raising is done
throughout the year,” Brem said.
“Donations from large companies,
the city, counties, as well as private
donations keep the festival run-
hing.” The festival employs three full
time staff members who do most of
the organizing; the rest are volun-
teers and student interns. “Without
them,” Brem said, “the festival could
not exist.” I

Two main stages, one in Point

— State Park and the other at Gateway

Plaza, will be set up to provide enter-
tainment. Nine major headliners
and more than 135 performances of
all styles of music. theater and dance

Royals pick Jelic
as 2nd round choice

On Monday, the Kansas City
Royals made Pitt catcher Chris
Jelic their second—round draft
choice in the regular phase ofthe
annual Major League Baseball
draft. Jelic, a 5-10, I85-pound
catcher from Mt. Lebanon came
to Pitt on a football scholarship,
but joined up with Coach Bobby
Lewis on the Panther baseball
team last spring. After a stint in
the outfield, Jelic was switched
to catcher this past spring, and
developed into one of the top
prospects in the country.

as their MVP after he batted a

Pitt aids Baylor in transplants,
sends team to help plan center

By Jon Williams
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh will
be sending an organ transplant team
to Baylor University Medical Center
in Dallas, Tex. to teach medical stu-
dents and surgeons at Baylor trans-
plant surgery techniques.

The team has already performed
four transplants under the leader-
ship of Pitt’s surgeon Dr. Goran
Klintmalm, and is proceeding to
instruct the staff at the medical cen-
ter in the ﬁeld of transplant surgery.
This instruction is being carried out
under an agreement that Klintmalm
deemed as the “only one of its kind.”

Jane Duffield, manager of the
Health Sciences News Bureau, said
the team members will continue to
be Pitt faculty members, even
though they will be permanently
assigned to Baylor University.

“The purpose of this placement is
for two reasons,” said Duffield.
“First, we believe we can perform
more operations involving trans-
plant surgery with the team at Bay-
lor. Second, we are expanding our
teaching of the transplant surgery to
Baylor to increase the number of
surgeons who can be trained in
transplant surgery."

According to Duffield, Baylor
was chosen because of its modern
medical facilities, its excellent
national reputation and the univer-
sity's proximity to the Southwest
Organ Bank in Dallas. Klintmalm
said the bank is the third largest in
the nation, and organ availability
from it would be an asset to the

. team.

In the past, Pittsburgh has been
overloaded with organs and
patients. By having the team at Bay-
lor, Klintmalm said they are hoping

~ that more patients can be served. In

cases when either center has a sur-
plus of patients or organs the school

will share cases.

Duffield said that Pitt has not yet
approved the plan. She said the uni-
versity will decide within the next
two weeks to approve the plan.

Dr. Thomas Starzl, of Pitt’s
Presbyterian-University Hospital,
who performed the first liver trans-
plant surgery in 1963, has made sev-
eral visits to Baylor setting up for the
transplant teams’ arrival. Starzl said
that his visits were made to direct
Baylor University in preparing for

the surgical training. The Post-
Gazette said rumors at Pitt were that
Starzl may be leaving Pitt for Bay-
lor. Starzl denied these rumors.

Duffield said that this will be a
joint program and that all staff
members that go to Baylor are not
leaving Pitt’s faculty.

Duffield said, “We are sending the
team to [apply] the expertise we
have [to] transplant surgery. We are
the best in the country and want to
continue that practice at Baylor."

Haig sees unfavorable outlook
in future U.S.-Soviet relations

By John Zaphyr
Staff Writer

Alexander Haig, former United
States Secretary of State, presented
a gloomy outlook for the future of
American and Soviet relations dur-
ing a World Affairs council lecture
Monday.

“Americans are going to have to
hunker down for a long, frustrating
period in the next four years,” Haig
said, addressing a cheering home
state audience at the Westin William
Penn Hotel. “If we keep balance and
consistency, though, we will be able
to pull through.” V

Haig cited several reasons for the
perceived difficulty between the two
superpowers, focusing on the incon-
gruity of U.S.-Soviet relations.

“The United States is inconsistent
in its dealing with the Soviets,” he
said. “For two years, they [the
Soviets] were treated with a hardline
approach, and then the next two
years the stance softened, became
more ﬂexible, and after that they
didn’t know what to expect.

“Also, leadership in Russia keeps
changing. It takes three or four years
to grasp the entire system, but the
recent heads of state have not had
the chance.”

Haig said he sees the disputed
“Star Wars” program as another
factor in the possible degeneration
of Soviet-Americn relations.

“The greatest threat of the Soviet
Union is ballistic weaponry,” he
said, “and a way to stop it is through
‘Star Wars,’ and it will just become
another point of disagreement.”

Former Secretary of State Alexander Haig.

'Pho}}3"'1}}"i5iin"Méiisihiih

However, he said he fully supports
the “Star Wars” program.

“We don't have the luxury to turn
over outer space to the mischievous-
ness ofthe Soviet Union,” Haig said.
“We know they are increasing their
activities and we have to react
accordingly.”

Haig also examined the situation
in Central America and the econ-
omy in the U. S.

“There has been a splitting of
focus in our policies in recent
months,” he said. “Our original
focus was to have order in Central
America —— not violent takeovers
and bloodshed.

“Today we have blurred our
vision with El Salvador and Nicara-
gua —— we don’t see the external
intervention of Cuba and the Soviet
Union as the major threat. But there
wouldn’t be concern with a Nicara-
gua that is Marxist unless Cuba and
the Soviet Union were involved.”

Haig recognized problems in the
American economy as well. He men-
tioned “supply-side mania” (exces-
sive tax reform and deregulation)
and a budget that is not ﬂexible
enough as causes for the nation’s
poor economy. But these are not the
main problems, he said.

“Contrary to belief, it is not inﬂa-
tion that causes problems but the
imbalance of foreign trade,” said
Haig. “The long-term consequences
are serious.”

While Haig spoke inside the hotel,
demonstrators picketed outside,
bearing signs protesting the treat-
ment of Greece, which Haig barely
touched on, while others brought
out different issues.

“The foreign policy of the nation

and state department is not in con- .

junction with our constitutional
amendments, and the government is
working contrary to them,” said
Gary Forest, a former Pittsburgh

mayoral candidate. “And Haig
represents those of that same
group.”

Poor working conditions cited 
as part of education problem

By Joe Krzywiecki
Staff Writer

Improving working conditions
for teachers, refocusing the Scholas-

tic Aptitude Tests and curbing the‘

present apathy of today’s students
were among the solutions suggested
to improve teaching, according to
Dr. Ernest Boyer, president of the
Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching.

“A major problem with today’s
educational system is that high
school students have become passive
and alienated from their schools and
community,” said Boyer as he
addressed about 100 people
gathered in honor of the 75th anni-
versary of Pitt’s School of Educa-
tion. “The nation is not comfortable
with its children.”

Boyer stressed that students must
learn to serve other students and
members of the community if educa-
tion is to advance, and he suggested
that students earn credit in school by
doing community work for the
elderly and other needy people.

In addressing the SATs, Boyer
said the test does not accurately
reflect what is being taught in the
nation’s schools. “The. SAT is a
strange and unusual system of meas-
uring education,” he said.

The SATs were created in I926 to
predict future scholastic success for
high school students. It has become,
according to Boyer “a tool to meas-
ure schools, not students,” as it was
originally intended.

Teachers may spend more time
preparing students for tests at the
expense of subjects and skills not
tested, Boyer said. Good scores on
the exams can justify claims by
school administrators that more
tests mean better education.

In place of SATs Boyer recom-
mends tests that would sort out
options for all students and not just
those planning to attend college. He

I a u . . . . . a I I . . . a . . . I . . . . . . .

also suggested tests that would bet-
ter correlate subjects that were actu-
ally taught so that students would
receive a broader education.

Boyer pointed out that in today’s
schools, teacher have faced deterio-
rating working conditions and little
or no support from the public. “How
can teachers be expected to teach
and police for drugs at the same
time?” said Boyer.

With increasing paperwork and
low pay, being a teacher is no longer
a priority job, Boyer said. Those
who carry on in the teaching profes-
sion face larger classes and are now
expected to provide counseling and

constant supervision ~— duties that

once belonged. to parents.

“To give teachers a raise in pay
would not make the problems in
teaching vanish," Boyer said. “The
teachers must be rewarded with
some sort of praise.”

Boyer went on to suggest that a
national scholarship for students
who wish to become teachers should
be established to attract more people

to the teaching profession. He also
said he feels that teachers must be
continually re-trained so that they
would be better able to face the
changing environments they find
themselves in.

With the increase of teaching
incentives and an attempt to
increase student enthusiasm, Boyer
noted that the present teaching
problem of not being able to reach
students could be overcome.

“After trying to teach all day and
having students leave with the same
look on their faces, it becomes very
frustrating,” said Boyer.

Boyer also noted that the educa-
tional assistance from the White
House has not been encouraging.
“The response from the White
House lacks leadership,”said Boyer.
“The only thing the president has
done is put a teacher in space.”

Boyer concluded by stressing that
the cooperation of students,
teachers and government is vital if
the nation’s educational system is to
improve in the next century.

Depression

continued from Page _0""
acute episodes of depression have
been in remission for five months.

Jarret stressed that anti-
depressant drugs are not addictive
like street drugs. “Without evidence
of depression, the drugs don’t do
much,” he said. “I had a young
patient who decided to sell his pre-
scribed drugs to his friends at
school. Needless to say, his friends
were not pleased to find out that
they had spent their money on a
drug that had no effect on them.”

Anti-depressant drugs work in the

released to allow signals to flow
from one nerve to another. “The
anti-depressant is like a key in a
lock," Jarret said. “It allows the sig-
nal to pass on.”

Anti-depressant drugs reduce the
symptoms of depression, affecting
physical symptoms first and emo-
tional symptoms later.

“The medication has some side
affects,” Jarret explained. “Patients
have complained of various combi-
nations of the following: dry mouth,

tion and blurred vision. All symp-
toms disappear after the patient has

been on medication for a short
while.”

The question still remains unre-
solved as to how long a patient
should remain on the drugs.

“Anti-depressants are adminis-
tered in increasing amounts until the
highest tolerable dosage is reached,”
Jarret explained. “It is not good to
stop taking the drug too soon
because of the chance of a relapse.
Most patients are advised to con-
tinue taking medication for three
months after their symptoms leave.

“For those who suffer from recur-
rent depression," he said, “it seems

that the longer they stay on the med-
ication, the better.”

ln addition to medication, psy-
chotherapy is used to treat the
depressed patient's emotional
symptoms.

“The combination of biological
and psychological treatments is
extremely important," Jarret said.
“In our program at WPIC, patients
are treated aggressively with medi-
cation and therapy for the first I2 to
15 weeks. Then they are gradually
reduced to a maintenance program
that continues for at least three
years.”

Fallen redemption in Texas

By Stephen Morrison
Staff Writer

“Have you ever been to
Paris?” asks Travis. lt’s the first
time that he’s spoken.

“What?” says Walt,
brother.

“Can we go‘ there now?”

“It’s a little out of the way.”

Walt doesn’t realize, of
course, that his brother is refer-
ring to Paris, Texas. Travis has
been missing for four years,
apparently having spent this
time wandering in the desert.
Now Walt has finally found him.

Thus begins Paris, Texas,
West German film director Wim
Wenders’ tale of severed ties and
identities in the American
Southwest. It took the grand
prize at the 1984 Cannes Film
Festival and for good reason: It
was the finest film of 1984. Natu-
rally, it was . ignored at the
Oscars.

his

Paris, Texas is graced by two‘

beautiful performances. Harry
Dean Stanton, a renowned char-
acter actor, is a revelation in his
first leading role. As Travis, the
battered and haunted drifter, he
is heartbreaking: His entire life
seems etched on his lined, sun-
burned face. When Walt tells
him about his son Hunter, whom
Walt has raised for four years as
his own son, the subtle emo-
tional changes that show only in
Travis’ eyes, ending in a /stream
of tears, are devastating.

No less impressive is Nastassja
Kinski as Jane, Travis’estranged
young wife. Always a remarka-
ble performer, Kinski finally has
a chance here to bring her talents‘
to a worthwhile film, after a
string of awful movies like Cat

iPe0ple and The Hotel New

Hampshire. Though her part is
limited to the final quarter ofthe
film (which runs two and one-
half hours), she leaves an impres-
sion that lingers long after the
film has ended.

The story line is slight — sur-
prisingly little actually happens,
considering the film’s length —

‘but Paris, Texas is rich in raw

narrative power. b
After cleaning Travis up, Walt
(portrayed by Dean Stockwell)
brings him home to his upper
middle-class Los Angeles resi-
dence, where Travis confronts
his son, now seven, whom he had
abandoned at three. _
Though wary at first, father
and son renew their bond. As
they grow closer, Walt and his
wife Ann worry that they may
lose Hunter, who has been like a
son to them. .One day Ann tells
Travis that Jane has been put-
ting money in a fund for the
boy’s future. Ann knows only
that Jane goes to a certain bank
in Houston on the fifth day of
each month _to deposit the
money. Travis soon resolves to
drive back to Texas to try to find
her. Hunter decides to go along.
To detail what happens next
would betray the considerable

suspense of the ensuing seg-
ments. The climactic confronta-
tion between Travis and Jane
has to be one ofthe most moving
scenes ever filmed.

Stockwell and Aurore Cle-
ment are fine as Walt and Ann,
as is Hunter Carson as Hunter,
who nearly steals the movie. His
scenes with Stanton are among
the film’s best.

Carson is the son of Kit Car-
son, who shares the film’s writ-
ing credit with Sam Shepard.
Paris, Texas has the Shepard
stamp A a hazy, almost surreal
feeling, as human relationships
are explored against the back-
drop of the desert Southwest.

At times the relentlessly slow
pace of the film is a liability ~
scenes of no obvious importance
drag on and end at seemingly
random places — but on the
whole the film’s length helps it.
The leisurely pace allows the
audience to grow to truly care
for the characters, and the
unfolding events are painstak-
ingly realistic (within Shepard’s
bound/aries) so that the viewer’s
suspension of disbelief never
falters.

One small complaint ‘can be
justifiably registered against the
acting in some of the smaller
roles. The German-accented
doctor at the beginning and the
Hispanic housekeeper, in partic-
ular, could have been eliminated
to the film’s benefit.

This brings up an interesting

subject: the abundance of for-

 

eign accents in the film. More
than half of the dialects in Paris,
Texas are not American: Aurore
Clement’s Ann (French); the
housekeeper (Spanish); the
county doctor (German); even
Nastassja Kinski's Jane (some
sort of Euro-Texan hybrid). The
overall effect of this is to aug-
ment the film’s mood of dis-
tance, separation and non-real-
ity . ' ’

In all regards, in fact, the film
mingles reality with ‘non-reality,

but one could argue that real life ,

is just such a blend. Mysteries
abound: What exactly did Travis
do for those four years? How did

 

Jane wind up where she is? Why

does Travis take everyone’s
shoes outside and polish them?

What is central to the story,
though, is resolved. While many
fringe questions are left unan-
swered, one leaves the film emo-
tionally satisfied. ‘

Paris, Texas is a rare and
remarkable film. Its perceptions
of human behavior are keen and
mature, and the acting in all of
the major roles is superb. Wen-'
ders has painted a portrait of
America that perhaps no Ameri-
can could paint. Paris, Texas is
beautiful, vast and sad. i

A lot like America.

Cleveland with palm trees is not Paradise

By Michael Selz _
Staff Writer

Stranger Than Paradise is a
minimalist exposition on min-
imal characters, with technical
valves that match. The three
larger sections, “The New
World," “One Year Later” and
“Paradise,” are broken up into
discrete shots, or vignettes, with
blackouts separating them. It’s
shot in black and white, which
accentuates the bleak graininess
of its industrial landscapes. The
oppressiveness of the film’s for-
mat and its glum, blase tone end
up being humorous and enter-
taining in a twisted, modern
way. The narrative, incidentally,
is incidental. For the record,
though, it goes as follows.

Sixteen-year-old Eva (Eszter
Balint) jets to New York from
Budapest, Hungary, to visit or

start a new life —— it’s unclear
which. Her very inhospitable
host is Willie (John Lurie), her
cousin, who inhabits a small
one-room flat on New York’s
Lower East Side. Though this is
“The New World,” the desola-
tion here is stupefying. In a re-
versal of our (and Eva’s) normal
expectations, the U.S. is not the
land of high culture and oppor-
tunity. Willie spends his time
sleeping, drinking beer, going to
the races, and eating TV dinners.

“Where does that meat come
from?” Eva asks suspiciously. “It
doesn't even look like meat."

“This is the way we eat in
America" her cousin replies. “I
gotmy meat, my potatoes, my
vegetables, an’ dessert, and I
don ’t even have to wash the
dishes."

By the time Eva leaves 10 days
later, Willie has a sort of inartic-

>639‘

dinner.

    

Eddie ets an education in Hungarian—American
living from Willie and Aunt Latte over a goulash

ulate fondness for her. His gam-
bling buddy, Eddie, likes her,
too. So a year later, when the
pair has $600, from cheating at
poker, they decide to visit her at

Willie’s Aunt Lotte’s in
Cleveland.

Lotte (Cecilia Stark) is a joy.
A big, stolid, pendulous-

breasted immigrant woman, she
is generous and demanding. She
feeds the boys but beats them at
Poker. (“I am the veener,” she
proclaims matter-of-factly.)
When they steal Eva away on the
second leg of their focused quest
— leaving Eva’s similarly listless
suitor. Lotte and a hot dog stand

JUNE 5, i985

job behind, — Lotte stands in
the snow cursing in Hungarian,
never raising her voice, never
faltering.

Good Americans go to Flor-
ida to find their dreams, and
Willie, Eddie and Eva do the
same, but the film’s photography
— the cheap motels and-the off-
season weather — makes it look
just like Cleveland or New York,
but with palm trees. What
happens here is a little interest-
ing and ironic, so I won’t ruin it
for you.

The movie shouldn’t be seen
for plot turns, though. It has a
seamy new look to it, and though
the characters and settings are
bleak and apathetic, they’re
comically so. It isn’t bland. It’s
just suffocating. And of course it
won the Camera D’Or at Cannes
in 1984. So it must be art.

The Truth: a band that knows how to Jam

By Bill ‘Ferguson
Staff Writer

THE PLAYGROUND
The Truth
IRS

It is ironic that a band with a
moniker such as The Truth’s
should be so brazenly derivative.
Which isn’t necessarily a liabil-
ity; it’s just that Playground
could have easily been The .lam’s
eighth album. In fact, vocalist
Dennis Greaves has perfected

Jam singer Paul Weller’s bari-
tone strain to the point of aston-
ishingedeja vu.

The lp opens_with the title
track — a bright, neo-soul piece
that vibrantly churns, chock—full
of exuberance. Playground
could have conceivably been the
B-side of a late Jam single -
“Beat Surrender,” perhaps.
Unfortunately, this is the
album’s peak, and most of the
remainder of the album, while
terribly promising in places, falls

short of the expectations pre-
sented by the album-opener.
By choosing such a genre -

the soulful ’60s Mod romp that
The Jam perfected on their late
albums and which Paul Weller
continues to employ with the
Style Council —— The Truth
already have quite a quandary to

combat what with such exalted

comparisons so readily availa-
ble. (Quite notably, The Jam had
a similar problem with their ten-
dency to liberate early Who

riffs.)

As The Jam managed to
escape their iconic forefathers,
The Truth occasionally rise
above the limitations of being
“copycats.”

“Exception of Love” is
bouncy soul, complete with sta-
ple falsetto back-up vocalsand
Chris Skorina’s Hammond
organ so cheesy it’s nearly edible.
“It’s a Miracle,” despite its sappy
title, is a slow, gorgeous song,
accented with sparse piano and

Greaves’ plaintive vocals a la
Paul Young.

At their worst on “Always on
My Mind,” they come off sound-
ing like the J. Geils Band doing a
pale Marvin Gaye imitation. At
their best, The Truth are a sac-
charin subsitutue for The Jam —
not a bad starting point,
actually. But if you want the real
soul truth — the truth that both
The Jam and The Truth try to
parlay into their own sound —
look no further than Motown.

Chipman adds Calipari

Spons

Bruce named head of
women's basketball team

By Michael Bertonaschi
Staff Writer

After weeks of speculation, the
University of Pittsburgh Athletic
Department officially announced
the hiring of Kirk Bruce as the head
coach of the women’s basketball
team. Former coach Judy Saurer
resigned in April, havingjust com-
pleted her fifth season as the Lady
Panthers’ head coach.

Bruce served as an assistant coach
under Saurer this past season and
was responsible for recruiting and
on-the-floor coaching. He was pre-
viously head coach at Clairton High
School where he led the boys’ team
to a I22-55 record in seven seasons.
His 1978 team won the WPIAL state
championship and four other teams
made the state tournament.

He was a standout guard for Pitt
in the early ’70s, leading the team in
scoring in 1974 with a 17-point aver-
age. His sister Jennifer became the
all-time leading scorer in basketball
history at Pitt this past season.

After a disappointing I6-l2 sea-
son last year, Bruce said that he feels
that some changes must be made.
“The basis of them will be attitude
changes,” he said. “I want to try and
instill in these players the confidence
that they can get thejob done. As far

as the X and O are concerned, I’m

sure there are going to be some‘

changes there, too.”

Over the entire season last year,
the Lady Panthers’ inconsistency
was highly noticeable. Bruce said he
feels that the inconsistent play was
due to physical and mental lapses.
He hopes to remedy the situation
using his own coaching philosophy.

“I think it boils down to the way I
would like to see these particular l2
girls play,” he said. “When they step
across those lines, they're going to
give me 100 percent, whatever that
may be. Whatever they can give, I
want it.

“The other part is that they must
be mentally prepared. I don’t want
to get in the middle of the game and
have to make a thousand adjust-
ments in order to get things done. I
want them to be prepared when they
step on the floor for whatever oppo-
nent we have that particular night.”

Last year‘s team has been deci-
mated by graduation, claiming the
top three leading scorers and
rebounders and much of the bench
strength. .

Bruce said that all 12 players must
contribute to this year's team. “I
think it’s going to have to be a con-
certed effort for everybody involved
to do the best theyncan to replace
those three players,” he said. “It
must be a team effort and not just

    

Kirk Bruce

one individual.”

Bruce said that the Lady Panthers
may rely on emotion to pull some
upsets this year. “A lot of these girls
have something to prove, that they
are a part ofthis team,” he said.
“Sometimes when you play like that,
you get performances from people
you never expect to give them.

“I think a lot of the players will be
playing inspired with a little more
pride within themselves because
they have a chance to do a little more

Pitt men’s basketball coach
Roy Chipman named 26-year-
old John Calipari to replace Jay
Eck as an assistant basketball
coach Monday. Calipari, an
assistant at Kansas University
for the past three years under
Ted Owens and then Larry
Brown, will assume his duties
this weekend. Eck resigned in
May to accept the head coaching
position at the University of
Wisconsin-Stevens Point.

A native of Coraopolis, Cali- .
pari was ecstatic as he spoke
from his office at KU on Mon-
day. “I’m moving back home,”
he said. Calipari is no stranger to
the Pitt program — he is a
former pupil of Pitt assistant
coach Joe DeGregorio, who
coached at Clarion State before
joining Pitt. Calipari was his
starting point guard during the
80-8l and 81-82 seasons as the
Eagles were NCAA tournament
participants.

How Calipari came to Pitt is
an interesting story. “I was not
looking for ajob,” he stressed. “I
just heard about the opening
near my home, so ljumped at the
chance. When I was in Pitts-
burgh for the interview, I was
still not sure whether I wanted

' the job or not, but after meeting
with Coach Chipman, I was

. time with Curtis Aiken,” Cali-

hooked. I was ina great situation
[at Kansas], but coming home
and being back with my family
— along with Pitt being in the
Big East, the best conference in
the nation, with a team on the
rise — was too much to pass up."

Calipari spoke of his duties
very frankly. “I’m here to
recruit,” he said. “That’s why I
was hired, and that’s what I'm
going to be doing."

Chipman knows he’s got a
good man. “He’s developed into
an outstanding recruiter and
teacher ofthe game while at Kan-
sas,” he said.

Pitt will remember the tough
battle Calipari and the other
Kansas coaches gave them a few
years back for the services of
guard Curtis Aiken. Aiken was a
Parade All-America from Buf-
falo, who swayed between Kan-
sas and Pitt before choosing Pitt.
Aiken will be one of the first pro-
jects for Calipari when he begins
here at Pitt, and he is looking
forward to it.

“I want to really spend some

pari said. “Coach Chipman told
me that Curtis did pretty good
last year, but we want him to
develop and play the way we
know he can.” _

Calipari will begin evaluating
prospective recruits for next year
when he arrives this weekend.
But for now, he is just concerned
with coming home. »

playing than they did last year. I
think if we play like that, we’ll win
our share of games.”

Among the players, the choice to
name Kirk Bruce as head coach has
been met with approval. “I think it's
great for the whole team,” said
sophomore forward Sally. Sheerer.
“He knows the girls, and we’re all
going to work well together.”

“I think that it was something
good that happened to the pro-
gram,” said Ellen Gilhooley. “He

relates well with the players and is
willing to listen to the players’ point
of view and work out a
compromise."

As Rollie Massimino proved, you
don’t always need the biggest,
strongest and fastest players to win.
A_positive attitude is just as impor-
tant. Said Sheerer, “I think our atti-
tudes will change for the better. The
feeling and attitude of Coach Bruce
are positive, and it will carry over to
the team.”
