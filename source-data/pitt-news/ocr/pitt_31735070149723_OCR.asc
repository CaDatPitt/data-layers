Pittsburgh City Council  
discusses campus night life

Breanna Durham
Staff Writer

A staff member from Pittsburgh City Council-
man Bruce Kraus’ office spent Homecoming
weekend at a house party in Oakland. But he
wasn’t celebrating — he was educating.

Matt Hogue walked into a party in a suit
and tie and was greeted by college students
at the door. , -

“They were like, ‘Dude, you got $5 to
cover your entry?’ And I said, ‘Dude, I’m not

b here to party. I am here to make you aware

of what’s going on,”’ hesaid.

Hogue presented a report on his interac— ‘

tions with underage students at a December
City Council meeting held to discuss student
life, nightlife and housing concerns in the
Oakland area. Pitt’s vice chancellor for gov-
ernmental relations,_ Paul Supowitz, was
also present at the meeting. He discussed
various programs and initiatives Pitt has
to help the relationship between students
and Oakland residents. _

The meeting took place in light of com-
plaints ﬁled by Oakland residents mention-
ing grievances ranging from littering to loud
and disruptive parties in the residential area
surrounding Pitt. Residents had also ar-
ranged for an oﬁiduty city oﬁicer to patrol

the neighborhood during Homecoming, but
an ofﬁcer never volunteered for the detail.

Both Hogue and Kraus said they hope to
educate students “into compliance” when
it comes to underage drinking, instead of
bringing in police. Kraus said that by edu-
cating students, he hopes their views will
change, and thus their interaction with the
environment will change’.

Hogue said that he asked at the house
party for the student hosts to show their
IDs. They were underage.

“I said, ‘You are asking for a world of
trouble,”’ he said. -

While Hogue did not arrange for police
involvement, he did report that he gave the
students a warning and explained to them
that under the social hosting law, they were
liable for all underage guests drinking al-
cohoL

He gave the students a warning to clear
the party and came back later to ensure that
they followed his instructions. Bythen, the
party had dissolved.

“I didn’t know what I’d face going into
it, but it actually turned out to be a pretty
positive event for me,” he said.

After talking with the students, Hogue
said parties stopped occurring at that lo-
cation for the rest of the year. He said he

Pitt ranked for ‘best value’

Mallory Grossman
News Editor

Even though Pitt ranked second—most—expen~
sive in the nation among public universities,
the University ranked as one of the top public
colleges in the U.S. in terms of value for both
in-state and out-of—state students.

And it ranked as the No. 1 best value
school in the state. '

The Kiplinger 100: Best Values in Pubic
Colleges, 2011-2012, to be published in Feb-
ruary 2012, lists Pitt as the nation’s 15th best
value for out-of—state students and 29th for
in-state students.

The University of North Carolina at Cha-
pel Hill tops the list at No. 1, and Penn State
comes in at 51st for in-state students and
47th for out— of-state students. The only other

universityin Pennsylvania that made the top. ’ . I
100 is West Chester University, which came‘

in at 90th for in-state student's*and 84th for
out-of—state students.

Kiplinger, a D.C.—based publisher, has put
out its Best Values in Public Colleges rank-
ings since 1998. The publication is a list of

the top 100 public four-year institutions..

It revamped its rankings thisyear to focus

more on criteria crucial to academic value, .

such as the percentage of students who re-
turn for sophomore year and the four—year
graduation rate.

According to the Kiplinger website, the

editors start with data collected from 500
public four-year schools and the list is then
narrowed to 100 schools. They base the value
of the schools based on cost and ﬁnancial

aid, student indebtedness, competitiveness,

graduation rates and academic support.

Pitt clocked in at an admittance rate of 58
percent and a 61 percent four—year gradua-
tion rate, according to the website.

The rankings put the University’s total

cost per year for in-state students at $26,672,
which goes down to $18,391 after need—based
aid is applied. The total cost per year for
out-of-state students is $36,080, and is de—
creased to $27,799 for those with need—based
aid. Penn State’s in-state cost per year is close
to Pitt’s at $26,940, but with need—based aid,

it only goes down to $20,333. The out-of—state‘

cost is higher than Pitt’s at $39,022 and goes
down to $32,415 with need—based aid.
UNC’"stota_l‘c'_ost.' per year for in-state stu-

jidents is  —-$6,548 with need—based

aid. The schobl’s out-of—state cost per year is
$37,454 and with aid it’s $26,374.
“As states cut funding for higher edu-

, cation and tuition continues to climb, the

word ‘value’ becomes more signiﬁcant than
ever,” Jane Bennett Clark, senior editor at
Kiplinger’s Personal Finance magazine, said

on the website. “This year’s top 100 public‘

schools deliver strong academics at reason-
able prices; We applaud these institutions for
tightening their belts without compromising
quality.” I '

Board members planhow
to complete term projects

Michael Ringling
Staﬁ” Writer

If the members of the new Student Gov-
ernment Board complete their initiatives,
Pitt’s club sports teams will practice on

campus, the roofs of Pitt’s buildings will

become more green and students will enjoy
easier access to the Waterfront.

Of course, this isn’t all that the newly
elected president and eight Boardmembers
hope to accomplish during their terms. But
if the hopes are to become a reality, the
Board members all agree that they must
work together.

The student body electedzjames Lan-

dreneau to serveas the 2012 Student Gov-

ernment Board president on Nov. 17. He‘

and the Board members will be inaugurated
on Thursday,]an. 5, in the Lower Lounge
of the William Pitt Union. And ‘then the
collaboration begins. '

“I want to makesure the group is a co-
hesive group,” said Landreneau, a senior
chemical engineering major. 4

The Board will spend the first weekend
of the spring semester at an off—campus
retreat, which ismeant to make sure the
Board me_mbers are “on the same page”

when it comes to completing their initia-
tives, Landreneau said. A
The Board will also choose ad hoc com-
mittees at the retreat. These committees
are added to the three standing commit-
tees — elections, judicial and allocations
— included in the SGB Constitution. In
2011, the Board chose to add committees
such as academic affairs, environmental
and governmental relations. _
- Landrenéau said that onjan‘. 9,'applica-
tions for SGB committee chairs will come

. out. He hopes to have the chairs of the

committees seated by the third week of
January.

Also during that month, Landreneau
said that he will continue to ‘work on for-

mer President Molly Stieber’s Allocations

101 program, with the change that he hopes
to shift more of the responsibility for the
program’s success to the Allocations Com-
mittee rather than the participating stu-
dent groups. A A

The Allocations 101 program informs
student groups about the allocations pro-
cess. The incoming allocations chair, Mike

Nites, will set the date, time and location '

for theseminar.

SGB halts the CoI|egiateReadershipp Program

Michael Ringling
Staﬁ” Writer

Students can expect to see empty spaces
where they once picked up their copies of
The New York Times and USA Today.

The new Student Government Board
Presidentjames Landreneau, along with an
agreement from SGB advisor Kenyon Bonner
and a unanimous vote -from the incoming
Board, has decided to halt the distribution of
the two newspapers through the Collegiate
Readership Program until locked drop boxes
are brought to campus.

Q‘

Landreneau said that he will meet with

Bonner, Pittfs director of Student Life, dur-
ing the ﬁrst week of January to discuss the
implementation of the drop boxes, but as of
now, he did not know when the boxes and
newspapers would return to campus.

The newspaper pilot program began last
spring semester. The campus—wide subscrip-
tions cost non-College of General Studies
students a yearly $30,500, which came out
of the Student Activities Fund. However, the
Board ran into difficulties in barring other
students, faculty and Pittsburgh residents
from picking up the papers.

The only thing keeping the public from
picking up the newspapers this past year was
a paper stop sign taped on all seven stands.
The papers informed passers—by that the

newspapers were for undergraduate students
only but did not specify that the newspapers
were only for non-College of General Studies
students. M

Unlimited access has been an ongoing is-
sue for the Student Government Board.

Former SGB president Molly Stieber
acknowledged the problematic part of the
program and spoke in support of installing
boxes for the newspapers.

The proposed drop boxes would limit
the papers to only the students who pay the
$80-per—semester Student Activities Fee
through an ID—swipe system. But as of now,
Landreneau said that the University does
not have approval for the drop boxes and
doesn’t know if Pitt IDs are compatible with
the drop boxes.

“The way I see it, if [the program] con-
tinues down the path as it has this year, it’s
going to be unsuccessful,” Landreneau said.
“I don’t want to waste any of the Student
Activities Fee foolishly.” ’

Incoming Board member Julie Hallinan
said that, according to a representative from
The New York Times, 99 percent of the news-
papers have been pickedup during the pilot

. year of the program. She said that she herself

picks up The New York Times multiple times
during the week.’ .

“I think it is worthwhile and deﬁnitely
something we should continue to have on
campus,” she said. But she also added, “We

don’t want to use the activities fee to fund for
something that everyone could use.”
Halim Genus, another incoming Board

member, also had concerns about continuing ‘

the Collegiate Readership Program. “Before
we go and spend this money again, we need
to talk to students,” he said. “Is [the program]
something the Student Activities Fee should
pay for?”

Genus said that the Board needs to discuss
“whether or not [newspapers are] philosophi-
cally something the Board should fund for.”

Landreneau said that the 2012 Board will
speak with other schools in Pitt, such as the
College of General Studies and the graduate
schools, and ask if they are interested in also
providing funding for the Collegiate Reader-
ship Program. I

The Board members all know each oth-
er through the campaigning process, but
many of the Board members were friends
before running for a spot on the SGB.

The new SGB president said that his
ties to Board member Gordon Louder-
back go back to Pitt’s PALS organization.

. Louderback succeeded Landreneau as the

PALS president.

Louderback said that Landreneau is
“kind of a mentor to me. Not just through
campaigning but [through] other on-cam-
pus activities.”

He said that the new SGB was already
talking about altering the room reserva-
tion system, but wanted students’ per-
spective, and research has been done on
implementing wireless Internet service
in the dorms.

Louderback also plans on establishing

' more green roofs —— roofs that have veg-

etation growing on them — on top of Pitt
buildings. He plans to meet with the 2011
Environmental Committee Chair Rebecca
Schroeder to discuss the green roofs.

Prior to his freshman year, Louderback
met fellow Board members Olivia ‘Arm-
strong and Alex Murdoch at the summer
program Pitt Odyssey. '

Murdoch, a junior, could not be reached
for further comment.

Armstrong is a junior studying exercise '

sciences, and said that she believes she
will completeher three "initiatives early
in the year.

She said that she has spoken with
administrators about shuttles and stu-
dent media, but‘
she would not say‘

on helping other Board members complete-

their projects.

“I am looking forward to working with
the Board members,” Armstrong said.
“Sometimes you need more than one Board
member to help each other out [with ini-
tiatives] .” '

Armstrong said she will work with

1 ogy Advisory Com-
mittee. Computing Services and Systems
Development (CSSD) will run the com-
mittee that will allow students to present
ideas to the department for technological
improvements on campus:

But Rothenberger said that her other
two goals will take longer to complete;
and she hopes to have Board support for
the textbook buyback initiative.

Pitt’s Assistant Di--

Board members will Work together on initiatives

“This is a huge project  I know this is
something I can’t tackle ‘on my own,” she
said. “Eight heads are better than one, so
I’m hoping we can all work together.”

Whereas Armstrong pledged to work
with Rothenberger on textbook buyback,
Board member Megan McGrath has plans
to work with Rothenberger on student
advertising.

McGrath, a junior, hopes to erect a
structure for student advertising, much
like the fence at Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity. She also plans to contact businesses

and propose sponsorship for the Water—_
front shuttle like the Target shuttle at the.

beginning of the 2611 fall‘semester.

“I’m not only excited to work on my
projects, but I want to reach out to students
and ﬁnd out what they are interested in,”
she said. '

Board" member Halim Genus, a junior

Africana studies and political science ma- ,

jor, also wants more students involved in
SGB decisions and projects. ‘
“I’d like to make [student organizations]
aware of decisions that are on the table
 I know how frustrating it can be to be
outside of the ,de_cision—making process,”
Genus said. “I plan to, in .a very informal
way, go to student organizations’ meet-

Oakland burglaries most

prevalent over winter break

Mary Mallampalli
Staﬁ" Writer

Pitt students aren’t the only ones who eagerly
await winter break.
The 17-day holiday recess gave burglars

v a prime opportunity to snatch jewelry, cash, ‘

electronics and other valuable goods from un-
attended buildings, apartments and homes in
‘Oakland and the greater Pittsburgh area. S
Between the Monday and Saturday before
Christmas, the city police received reports of 48
burglaries in Pittsburgh. From Dec, 17 through
Jan. 2, before many students arrived back on
campus, Pitt police received three reports of
burglaries. This_number does not include theft
from cars. ~
Valerie Milie, a detective for the Pitts-
.burgh Burglary Squad, said that burglary is
most prevalent in '
Oakland during the
holiday season out
of all the Pittsburgh
neighborhoods.
“Pitt students
are away for the
holidays, and a lot
of burglars know

They know these .
college kids some-
times leave a lot of

trying_ to make things comparable for their
families. And they’re not able to, so they go
out and they steal,” Richard said.

Richard also said that burglaries are more
prevalent during the holiday season because
people unknowingly advertise their new gifts
and electronics by leaving empty boxes out in
front of their homes. A

“People know that you’re buying big-tick-

eted items .‘,Don’t putboxes out in front of your .

home, like big television boxes and things like
that. You need to cut them up and store-them
for trash day,” Richard said. “People see those
things and they ﬁgure, ‘Oh, this is ripe for the

picking.’ So different homes are targeted be-

cause it’s being advertised.” , -
Each year the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police
revamps their website with safety information

for Pittsburgh residents, including tips for safe ’

holiday shopping and gift storage.

- i “This year, we’ve
put up a page on our
website called ‘Keep
yourjunkinthe Trunk,’
that teaches people
what to be aware ‘of
when they’re Christ-
mas shopping, how to
walk to their cars with

According to Pitt police’s Campus Crime 1

Report, 46 burglaries occurred on campus
and in the surrounding Oakland area in 2010-
— nearly triple the amount from 2009, when
16 burglaries were reported to the Pit police
and University officials.

In Pittsburgh, which the Economist Intel- A
ligence Unit named one of the “most—livable”
cities in the U.S., the police received reports of
a total of 2,910 burglaries in 2010.

That numb er is still signiﬁcantly lower than
those of the robberies reported inHonolulu and
Washington, D.C., which were ranked as the
second and third most-livable cities. In 2010,
5,760 and 4,231 burglaries were reported to
authorities in the cities, respectively. But these
cities are much larger than Pittsburgh. When
the amounts of crime per thousand residents
are compared, Pittsburgh has 9 crimes per
1,000 residents, while Honolulu has 6.6, ac-
cording to the FBI’s uniform crime reports.

Diane Richard, spokeswoman for the Pitts-
burgh Bureau of Police, said the number of bur-
glaries typically increases during the holiday
season for many different reasons:

“One reason is that people are out ofwork,
and this is the type of time of year when they’re

throughout the year.
They also partner with Pitt police to handle
and prevent burglaries in the Oaklandarea,
including looking after off-campus houses and
apartment buildings.

During winter break, Pitt police still patrol
the University and Oakland area_24/7. But Of-
ﬁcer Ron Bennett of the Pitt police said that
students and residents still havea'responsi—
bility as far as preventing burglaries on and
off campus. '

“Our advice to students is to secure all
of their valuables before leaving [for winter
break] ,” Bennett said. “They should make sure
all windows and doors are secured not only
during the holidays, but at all times.”

Milie said that city police and the Burglary
Squad work with pawn shops throughout Pitts-
burgh to help victims ofburglary retrieve stolen
valuables. ,

The pawn shops’ employees keep lists of
items and the people who pawn them, and
the lists are sent to the Burglary Squad. If the
detectives can match the serial numbers of
items with the victims’, they can usually track
down the burglars.

‘Milie said that the Burglary Squad can track
down many more stolen items if owners write
down the serial numbers, makes and models
of their valuables. I l

Council hopes to create partynotifcations

Council ( 2

will come back next fall to monitor student
behavior and provide information on the
repercussions of underage drinking.

“You won’t see us, but we’ll see you,” he
said. “You don’t want to lose your housing
over something stupid.” '

According to the University’s. housing
contract, Pitt can terminate student housing
contracts if it believes that a student poses
a clear and present danger to students, the
University community or the community
at large V

During the City Council meeting, Kraus

proposed setting up a network of people ’

who would notice underage parties forming

earlier in the day and who would inform the

proper ofﬁcials who would handle them.
Following the “heads up,” the students

involved would be told what the law states

and what could happen if they were to pro-
ceed with their actions.

Currently, that network does not exist,
but Kraus said that it could be something
for the future.

__.__“___.

A see you.

At the meeting, Supowitz reported on
the “Pitt Promise” that incoming freshmen
must recite. The promise obligates students
to uphold University expectations and com-
mits them to the advancement of learning
and service to society.

Supowitz said that Student Affairs also
sends letters outlining University rules and
regulations to students, but he said he be-
lieves many students see Univers_ity mail and
throw it out. He said this poses a problem
for getting University news out. A '

Pitt ofﬁcials have set up Twitter and
Facebook accounts to better reach out to
students and alert them to possible safety
concerns and educate them on destructive
and appropriate behaviors. .

In addition, Supowitz said Pitt Make a
Difference Day, a day of community service
in the fall, works to promote positive student
interaction with the city.

Kraus said that by involving themselves
in such activities, students become less likely
to be destructive to their neighborhoods.

He said that this goes along with “creating
a culture of awareness and respect.”

Kraus said students will forge more in-
timate ties to the community and think,
“I know you, and so therefore I feel some
responsibility in your well-being and in re-
specting that you have an investment here,
t'oo'.”i

But Kraus said there is currently no data
available to demonstrate whether these
various programs are improving student-
neighbor relationships.

effort, but the meetings do help.

“I think it’s productive discussion,” he
said.
’ Kraus said he hopes to involve students
in their efforts. He thinks that then a good
solution will come up. -

try assembled in Pittsburgh,” he said. I

EDITORIAL

Chryst could   
save Pitt football

A lot changed for Pitt while we
were enjoying Winter Break.

Former head football coach
Todd Graham bolted for Arizona
State University on Dec. 14 with
little notice. And eight days later,
Pitt named Paul Chryst, the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin’s offensive
coordinator, its new head football
coach.

only half of the team’s coaching
staff left, there seems to be little
hope left for the program. But
we think perhaps Chryst will be a
welcome solution to the Panthers’
woes.

Bear withus here, and consider,

the following.

First of all, Chryst is old. The
46-year-old certainly wasn’t go-
ing to get the head—coaching job at
Wisconsin any time soon, so in all
probability, he wants to settle down
and make Pitt his true home.

Two other candidates were
Florida International head coach
Mario Cristobal, 31, and interim
Ohio State head coach Luke Fickell,
28. Taking the head—coaching job
at Pitt would’ve only been a step-
ping stone for either of these young
men, who are at the beginning of
their careers. '

Second, Chryst promotes the
kind of mindset that Pitt’s program
needs right now. After all the ﬂash-
iness of Graham’s scant one-year
stay, Pitt needs someone low-key
like Chryst, who lets his players do
the talking. _\

After employing four head
coaches in just two years, Pitt
should just construct a program
in which its personnel, players,
students and fans can take pride.
No more high-octane nonsense
and championship. talk. We just
want to know our school pride is
in good hands.

With Graham long gone and

This is a program that needs to
start fresh in order to be relevant
again. And if Chryst’s track record
is any indication, he will make sure
to adapt his offense to his players
— not try to make -his pro—style
quarterback into Michael Vick.

Chryst is the reality check.we
needed.

Finally, and perhaps most obvi-
ously, he’s a players’ coach.

Zach Brown, a former Wiscon-
sin Badger, even introduced.Chryst
to the players, showing his respect
for the coach.

Compare this to Graham skulk-
ing away to Arizona, leaving the
players ﬂimsy farewell text mes-
sages in his wake, and it’s clear that
the team is much better off than it
was a month ago.

, And the Panthers aren’t shy
about it either. Team members
openly expressed their shock and

disappointment at Graham’s exit

— but they also showed their ex-
citement for Chryst’s arrival.

Wide receiver Devin Street
tweeted that he spoke with a Wis-
consin player who said Chryst is a
“cool guy” and a great coach. And
Street —— who had been burned
just days before by his former head
coach —— ﬁnished the tweet with,
“Come on hire him already.”

The fact that Pitt was able to
turn around and accept this man
with open arms is a testament to
the respect and reputation Chryst
has earned over the years.

And especially when it comes
to respect and reputation, it’s clear
we’re observing two very different
men here. We like what we have
seen so far, but Chryst is correct
when he says that his actions will
do the talking. . .

_ After all, Graham’s actions sure
did. I I '

European fin

ancial

crisis just getting into gear  

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

The eurozone has landed itself in
a monetary version of Der Ring
des Nibelungen, Richard Wagner’s
cycle of operas, and doesn’t like
it. ‘ ’

ers that be will come forth from
the Halls of Valhalla in Brussels

announcing that they’ve resolved . .

the debt crisis with a new, sure-
ﬁre plan. For a while, the markets

calm down and we get 30 minutes '

of dull recitative about the need
for austerity. Then the Investment
Valkyries realize that the latest so-
lution is far from comprehensive,
and continue selling Italian and
Spanish debt. The more the plot
develops, the more it appears to
be foreshadowing the ﬁnal defeat
of the Euro Gods, the collapse of
the Euro itself.

In all the Wagnerian drama of
the Euro_crisis, however, it’s easy to
lose track of what’s actually going

— a problem that, if left uncor- .

rected, threatens world ﬁnancial
stability.

The Greek debt crisis was.

caused largely by a bunch of inves-
tors deciding that the country, with
its high debt load and structural
problems, wasn’t .a good credit
risk. This led to a. massive bond
selloff, which caused the interest

climb to the point that it became
impossible for that government to

to a pile of debt in other countries,

tainable rates_for a long period of
time, the EU will not be able to help
them — Italy is simply too big. This
might lead Italy to either default on

its debt or leave the eurozone to ’

pay off the debt in a currency that

‘this scenario, the world’s banking

and ‘the Euro fallsapart, as other

STICKING MY NECK OUT

 

Tracey Hickey
Columnist

Watch your language.
No, not THAT language — I don’t really give
a &$@’‘% how you use that language, as long
as it’s not around kids. I’m talking about the
kind of language that co—opts other peoples’
traumatic experiences, alienates those with
mental illness and otherwise turns people
into punchlines. ’

How many times have you heard this
during ﬁnals week: “Ugh, I just got raped
by my ‘OChem test.” ‘

People who say that aren’tactually try-
ing to trivialize sexual assault. They’re not
actually trying to argue that failing; test is“

a

trauma on par withbeing sexually ass'ault‘e ,.

They’rejust using the word, which is
and attention—getting, to make their sp‘eech '

more colorful. The handful of Occupiers'
who think it’s okay to say corporations are
“raping the country” or that the one per-

cent is “raping the middle class” defend the ‘

metaphor as an apt means of illustrating an
injustice that deprives a victim of power.
But there are countless words in the
English language. You could say you were
crushed, trampled or ﬂattened by your
OChem test, and that the corporations

taxpayers bailed out are parasitizing the
middle class. The only reason» to choose
the ham—ﬁsted rape metaphor over more
appropriate phrasing is to elicit the maxi-
mum shock reaction. And since we live in
a country where a woman is sexually'as—
saulted every two minutes, according to
the U.S. Department of Justice’s National
Crime Victimization Survey, your unfet-

tered shock—rocking comes at the price of -

an overwhelming likelihood that a survivor
of sexual violence is going to overhear you,
or see your poorly-worded protest sign and
feel like complete crap. Is it worthit‘?
Rape survivors aren’t the only people

Avid triggering language to keep others

living with obsessive-compulsive disorder

speak about his experience when his friends
understand OCD as a vague descriptive term
for anyone who cares whether or not his
socks match? How does someone really
suffering from an eating disorder ﬁnd the
courage to admit it to people who deadpan,
“don’t be so anorexic” whenever someone
skips a couple of meals? This kind of careless
usage discourages people living with mental
illness, or it makes them into a punchline.
One troubling phenomenon that’s been
turned into a joke on an alarming scale is

self-injury, especially cutting. Maybe some- _

one remembers the middle and high school
days when “emo kids” were a thing and there

‘was a joke that went, “I wish my lawn was

emo so it would cut itself.”

About four percent of Americans report-
edly self-injure, according to ajournal of
Clinical Psychology study, including people
from all backgrounds, but self-injury is still
many peoples’ mean-spirited shorthandfor
teen angst or unseemly whining.

I’ve even seen people make sarcastic
slashing motions over their wrists to indi-
cate they think someone is being melodra-
matic. In fact, I’ve seen my close friends

do this in front of me at a time in my life

when they knew I was struggling with self-
injury.
Were my friends openly mocking me? N o,

comfortable

I don’t think they were. When I called them
put on their hurtful behavior, they were
mortiﬁed. They’d gotten into the habit of
using self—harm as a joke, and they failed to
break the habit when it really counted.

That, more so than all this hurtful rheto-
ric being an unimpressive shortcut to really
evocative speech, is my argument for cutting
this crap out right now.

I used to use language carelessly, and I »

stopped ﬁrst and foremost because I knew
that if I kept saying that I was sexually as-
saulted by a homework assignment, I wasn’t
going to remember to edit myself when I was
around someone I knew was a survivor of
sexual violence.

If this all sounds a little too Politically
Correct for you — if you think I’m stepping
on your free speech —- please take a moment
to think of what you’re really saying when
you-say, “I have a right to call this corporate
abuse rape if I want to” or “I have a right to
joke about being OCD if I want to.”

You’re saying to millions of trauma sur-
vivors and people who live with mental ill-
ness: “My right to toss around these words
supersedes your right to feel comfortable
and safe, and I have the rightto be disre-
spectful in order to make my point.” And I
have the right to call you hurtful and your
language disrespectful.

New Year’s resolutions should be attainable, realistic

Cathy Butchy
Contributing Editor

The phrase “time—honored tradition” applies to
New Year’s resolutions in three ways.

Firstly, the tradition of forming New Year’s
resolutions has indeed withstood the test of ﬁme.
It is therefore, by deﬁnition, atime-honored tra-
dition. Secondly, as paradox would have it, on a
yearly and consistent basis the honoring ofNew
Year’s resolutions decreases with the passage of
time. Most resolvers still have a good chance of

sticking to their goals onjan. 2. Whether their ,

commitment lasts into February — or even
through the week — is another story.

Thirdly, both “time—honored tradition” and
New Year’s resolutions are cliches — objects that
retain a symbolic meaning thanks to common
usage and habit, but that have become almost
entirely unoriginal, impersonal and empty.

Working as a copy editor for a newspaper,
I’ve been imbued with the view that cliches are
among the world’s worst evils, to be avoided
whenever possible. Yet everyjan. 1, I make a
pledge. And I believe doing so is a worthwhile
practice. '

Although present-day resolutions are more
frequently the brunt of jokes than serious un-
dertakings, diligently ‘considered New Year’s
goals are not without value. Should we choose
to use the new calendar year in its most helpﬁil

capacity —— as a means to gainperspective on
whathas come before and whatwe hope for and
anticipate in the future —- we can look at New
Year’s resolutions in a new light. This practice
that, thanks to overuse and misapplication, has
come to seem banal is actually less aclichethan
apiece of history, and one that can still be use
ful today.

New Year’s resolutions, reports Yahoo News,

have roots that extend into Roman tradition.
In the ﬁﬂth century B.C., leaders of the ancient
civilization placedjanuary at the beginning of
their calendar. They named the mo nth after the
Roman godjanus, whose ‘two heads allowed him
to look at once both backward and forward. The
image captured well the spirit of the changing
year, symbolizinganopportunity to look toward
the ﬁiture while reﬂecting on the past.
Although the Babylonians celebrated their

‘New Year in the month of Nissanu (the first day

of which, by thejulian and Gregorian calendars,
occurs in March), the very ﬁrst New Year’s reso-
lutions can most likely be credited to them. The
members of this agricultural society made it
their habit to use the New Year as a reminder
to return borrowed farming equipment. As an
online article from Australian newspaper The
Age points out, the Babylonian tradition lives
on in one of today’s most popular New Year’s
resolutions — eliminating debt.

Over the years, the tradition of performing
a simple positive task has given way to an end-

less variety of charitable promises and, even
more commonly, pledges of self—improvement.
Althoughthis means thatthe conventional pros-
pects for how best to usher in a fresh calendar

year have expanded greatly, the widening of

purpose has also had awatering—down effect on
resolutions’ effectiveness and success rates. In an
article on 43Things.com, journalist Lia Steakley
reports that a 1997 University of Washington
study found that 47 percent of the;1OO million
adult Americans who form resolutions do not
maintain their commitments any longer than
two months. In the past 10 years, she writes,
the statistic has grown to 80 percent.

Steakley e author of a self—help book on
organization and goal-accomplishment— states
that, combined with the particular difficulty of
pledges that involve behavioral changes, “the
non—speciﬁcity of most resolutions is the main
culprit behind the rising percentage of people
who fail to keep their New Year’s pledge.” In
other words, vague promises such as, “I’ll eat
healthier,” and “I’llwork onbeingless stressed,”

actually hinder well-intentioned resolvers from .

reaching their goals.

The organizers of lifestyle—improvement
company MeYou Health agree. The company
launched antiresolution.comto combat the prac-
tice of setting goals that are “unrealistic and set
people up forfailure.” Onthe interactive site, us-
ers canselectaresolution andviewtips forhow

to achieve the same end using any of a number of

small, manageable tasks; “Instead of making a
huge year-long goal,” the site claims, “we believe
in the power of small daily actions.”

But decidingto stick to basic, achievable tasks
doesn’t make forming a New Year’s resolution
obsolete. Instead, perhaps the best advice is to
combine practicality with positive opportimism
by taking advantage the new start. The mindset
of beginning fresh can help the resolutions you
choose feel more like lifestyle shifts than items
on a to—do list.

So, don’t let the clichéd nature of the mod-
ern New Year’s resolution discourage you from
choosing a goal. Speciﬁc, manageable resolu-
tions are not only millennia old, they’re also
as achievable and beneﬁcial as you choose to
make them. Although MeYou Health decries the
resolution philosophy, their site can offeragood
place to start. The company’s Daily Challenge,
which users can subscribe to from its website,
was recently featured in the Philadelphia In-
quirer as a handyway to start the new yearwith

’ a fresh step toward healthy living.

This year, my resolutionwillbe to never show
up to class without a pen or pencil. It might be
small and simple, butI knowl can stick to it, and
I expect it to add to my mental health, organiza-
tion and general quality of life enormously. See
if you can pick a challenge just as well—suited to
you. You’ll be ringing in the new year right.

Problems arise with
possible debt solutions

Kozlowski 1 12

So, how ca_n the relatively solvent Euro
countries prevent this chain of events from
occurring? Three main proposals, unfortu-
nately, are misguided: to issue bonds that are
guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the
more solvent countries like Germany to fund
countries like Italy at lower interest rates; to
set up a bailout fund that would ‘ensure that
owners of Italian debt feel conﬁdent that
they’ll be paid back; or to have the European
Central Bank print more money and use that
to buy debt off threatened countries. _

The problem with
the joint—bond approach
is that the Germans have
good reason not to like it. I
Itwouldl appear to them
that they’re sponsoring
irresponsible spending /
on the southern periph— '

 the "winter." The .
1‘ Ge‘rmans”w‘ou’ldaccept the issuing of joint

: bonds on the condition that strict new rules
are enacted that limit how much countries
I can spendand incur deﬁcits. Such a loss of
sovereignty would require a messy renego-
tiation of the EU treaty.
The problem with the bailout ﬁind is that,
in order for it to be big enough to cover Italy,
it would have to use lots of ﬁnancial leverage,
just as Lehman Brothers relied on a lot of
leverage. If that bailout fund doesn’t calm the
markets and the assets continue to sink, this
causes serious problems for the countries
that contributed money "or guarantees to
the bailout fund. A failed bailout fund would
have the potential to wreck the heretofore-
healthylGerman government ﬁnances.
I The problem with the ECB printing

money in potentially unlimited quantities
is twofold. First, it could lead to inﬂation,
which would further push Europe into eco-
nomic turmoil. Second, it could create a
moral hazard problem: Member countries
might be tempted to behave irresponsibly
once they have guarantees of inﬁnite money
from the central bank.

‘For these reasons, none of the pro-
posed schemes are likely to work, even if
they are implemented. Instead, solutions
for the eurozone contagion problem are

in the hands of the

sis, Ireland has done
a commendable job
taming investor wor-
ries. Mario Monti now
leads Italy, which has
a national-unity gov-
ernment at its helm.
Monti is ‘considered
very.capable, and the
atmosphere of crisis
and gravity might just
persuade the Italian parliament to make the
necessary reforms. Furthermore, despite

- having a high debt burden as a percentage of

GDP, Italy is in much better shape ﬁnancially
than Greece. '

A lot of conﬁdence is likely to be restored
simply because the man Monti replaced,
Silvio Berlusconi, was seen (not unfairly) as a
buffoon. Italy also has the potential for faster
growth if it can simply reform its sclerotic
business environment, and this growth will

.go a longway towards restoring investor

conﬁdence. I think that Monti will be able to
restructure ‘Italy and gradually ease it away
from crisis. If he isn’t, the Euro is doomed,
despite the best efforts of Brussels and all
the forces of Valhalla.

friendly gear —— whether that means" saving
up to shop well-known green brands like
Matt 8: Nat, Blue Canoe or Tom’s of Maine,
checking out thrift stores or swapping with
friends. Eco—conscious brands employ sus-
tainable practices and donate funds to sup-
port the less fortunate, making shelling out
the cash a bit easier. And with thrift stores
and swapping, you can save money by ﬁnd-

ing something that comes secondhand. It’ll i

also save the item_from getting tossed.

resources used to grow equivalent amounts

something for the environment, and you
save on your grocery bill.

‘Tintin’ reminiscent of childhood adventure dreams

“The Adventures of Tintin”

Directed by. Steven Spielberg

Starring Jamie Bell, Andy Serkis, Daniel
Craig

Grade: B
With danger, secrets, chases and strange lands,

Steven Spielberg’s‘adaptation of .“The Adven-
tures ofTintin” feels like a classic comic brought

to life on the screen — and with good reason. ,

The ﬁlm is based on three titles in a comic

L series created by artist Hergé (Georges Remi).

Set during the 20th century, the series revolves
around the adventures of Tintin, a_ Belgian
reporter, who; is o_f'ten_;aid,ed ‘byafox terrier

- The ﬁlm opens with Tintin (Jamie Bell) and
Snowy wandering the market, where Tintin
purchases a model of a ship called the Unicorn.
Immediately after the purchase, two men ap-
proach the reporter: One warns him about the
danger he’s in as long as he’s in possession of
this model ship. The other tries to buy the ship
from  ‘ -
. Refusing to sell it, Tintin takes themodel
home, where Snowy damages it. This reveals
a hidden scroll in its mast. While researching

Vthehistory of the ship on which the model was V
based, Tintin discovers that it sank during its T’ 9

last voyage, supposedly carrying secret cargo. ‘

Unfortunately, the model is stolen; the only
piece left behind is the one Snowy knocked
loose. As the ﬁlm progresses, it becomes in-
creasingly clear that this is the item the thieves
wanted. The message is unmistakable when the
man who warned Tintin= earlier is found shot
on his doorstep. ‘ ,

Tintin calls the police and is soon abducted
and taken aboard a ship where Captain Haddock
(Andy Serkis) is also held. In a drunken stupor,
Haddock reveals that he holds a secret about the
Unicorn passed down by his family — which
he’s forgotten. _

across the sea to strange lands and back by

Pitt’s. Alternative Break program is much more than a volunteer experience over spring break.
The program offers community based projects that include engagement with members of the
community and exposure to the problems, customs and culture of the region. Our teams are
trained by the community‘ partner to understand the specific content of their service work and
are prepared to carry out their tasks. Alternative Break creates an experience that inﬂuences
participants to reflect on the impact and meaning of their service, to transfer what they have
learned to their own communities and to start them on a course of lifelong active citizenship.

. What we do on Alternative Break?

During the week of Alternative Break, a team of Pitt students participate in a daily volunteering
service project with a local nonprofit organization or community partner. Students travel by
chartered bus, train or van to the service site. The sponsoring agency gives an orientation that
outlines the social issues and local impact in the" community. Students participate in 30 hours
of service over 4 days with community participants. The last day is set aside for sightseeing
and exploring the area. The team leader ends each day with group and individual refiection.
Aitemative Break is drug and alcohoi~free. "

Alternative Break....it’s the break that will last a lifetime!

Pitt hopes

xwisconsin
coordinator
takes over

R] Sepich & Lauren Kirschman
Sports Staff

Eight days after losing Todd Gra-
ham to Arizona State, Pitt intro-
duced Paul Chryst as its new foot-
ball head coach at its South Side
facility on Dec. 22.

Following Dave Wannstedt’s
pressured resignation, Michael
Haywood’s ﬁring after a domestic
abuse charge and Todd Graham’s
recent departure, Chryst became
the fourth Pitt football head coach
in the last 13 months.

Chryst left his alma mater -
the University of Wisconsin —— to
accept the head—coaching position
at Pitt. He had been the Badgers’

7offensive coordinator since 2005
and was considered by many to
be one of the best coordinators in
college football.

, Describing the decision to take
the head—coachingjob at Pitt as a

“no—brainer,” Chryst said it was

the history of Pitt football that at-
tracted him to the job.

“What is exciting to me about
Pitt is that there is unbelievable
tradition here,” he said. “You can
talk about Tony Dorsett, you can

$51k about Mark May, you can talk
about Dan Marino, you can talk
about the current: [Darrelle] Revis
and [Larry] Fitzgerald. There are
too many names to do it justice.”

Chryst also said that he plans

ﬁn being the Panthers head coach
for more than one season, unlike
predecessor Todd Graham.

“This is a destination job to

me,” Chryst said. “If you can’t live in _

the moment, then you’re cheating
avourself, and you’re cheating your
players. This is a pretty good gig.”
Born in Madison, Wis., Chryst
attended college in his hometown
and started at quarterback for the
Badgers.
Chryst then began his coaching
éeareer at West Virginia as a gradu-
ate assistant in 1989.
After 23 years as an assistant

different colleges, two Canadian
Football League teams and one
World League of American Foot-
ball team, Chryst will become a
head coach for the ﬁrst time in his
career at Pitt.

“I’ve had a lot of great men—
tors,” Chryst said. “I’ve been fortu-
nate, and I thank [Wisconsin head
coach] Bret [Bielema] for allowing
me to pursue this dream.” _

Since taking over the Wiscon-
sin offense in 2005, Chryst has
helped the Badgers earn back-
to-back Rose Bowl bids and has
transformed their offense into one
of the best in the country.

This season, Chryst’s offense

averaged 466.9 yards and 44.6
points per game. Quarterback Rus—
sell Wilson and running back Mon-
tee Ball both ﬁnished in the top 10
of the Heisman Trophy voting.

Wilson passed for 2,879 yards
and 31 touchdowns, while Ball
ﬁnished with more than 2,000
all-purpose yards and led the na-
tion with a remarkable 38 touch-
downs.

Chryst didn’t describe his of-
fense with words‘ like “high‘-oc-
tane” or “explosive” and said that
he prefers his team’s play to do the

' talking.

the BBVA Compass Bowl onjan. 7.

Last season, the Panthers played Ken-
tucky in the Compass Bowl without head
coach Dave Wannstedt, who resigned under
pressure. Interim head coach Phil Bennett
coached that game.

Pitt hired Wisconsin offensive coordinator
Paul Chryst as its new head coach eight days
after Graham departed for Arizona State.
To hire Chryst, Pitt went through its third
coaching search in just more than year.

After former Pitt head coach Dave
Wannstedt resigned, the Panthers hired Mi-
chael Haywood and ﬁred him shortly after
he was arrested on a felony domestic abuse
charge in South Bend, Ind.

At a court hearing on Feb. 11, Haywood
entered a court diversion program in Indi—
ana, which requires 60 hours of community
service and a psychological evaluation. If
he completes the deal, the charges will be
dismissed in one year.

In a statement, Jerome Cochran, Pitt ex-
ecutive vice chancellor and general counsel,
said Graham “has failed to comply with the

. terms of his contract.”

Pederson said he couldn’t talk speciﬁcally
about the buyout provision in Graham’s con-

, tract, but he stated that there is one and ‘We

will have to work through those details.”
Pederson said he was in Greensboro, N.C.,

Graham bolts for ASU

for a meeting with leaders of the Atlantic
Coast Conference when he received a call;
from Graham late in the day.

“He told me he and his family were dis-
cussing all day an opportunity at Arizona
State, where they had reached out to him for
a head coaching job,” Pederson said.

Pederson said he was “at a loss at why
into a year, we would be talking about an¥
other job.”

Graham asked for permission to talk to
Arizona State University, but Pederson de-
nied the request.

“Less than a year in, I think we are well
within our bounds to deny somebody per-
mission,” Pederson said.

“When I talked to Coach Graham the last
time it was 6:45 p.m., and about an hour and
a half later, I got an email indicating that
he was going to resign his position here,”
Pederson said.

;,.é.,,

Pederson said he then made numerous‘ '

phone calls the night of Dec. 13 and the
morning of Dec. 14, getting an early flight
out of Charlotte, N .C., so he could meet with
Graham to talk and “see if we [could] resolve
any issues.”

Graham sent an email out to the players,
Pederson said.

Pederson acknowledged the difficult tim-

Students shocked, angered

mg of Graham leaving as the football players
were studying forﬁnals and preparing for the
Compass Bowl game.

“They handled it like champions,” Ped-
erson said of the football players receiving
the news.

Graham has jumped from program to
program before. In 2006, Graham left Rice
University for University of Tulsa after one
year. Pederson said they talked about Gra-
ham’s move “pretty intently” when they hired
him. .

“Hesaid at the time Tulsa wasa unique
situation because he had been there before,”
Pederson said. ’

Pederson said he thought there were
“other ways to handle” telling the football
players he was resigning than sending an
email. Graham never told the football players
face—to -face about his resignation, Pederson’
said. — , »

_ “There has been a lot of people who have
invested their life in this. All those people are
impacted,” Pederson said.-

. Interim head coach Patterson spoke of
how he wants to honor his father’s recent
death bycoaching this team. He spoke to the
football players on Dec. 14.

“I told them, we are going to ﬁnish what
we started,” Patterson said.

Patterson came to Pitt this year from Tulsa
with Graham, a close friend. He said he heard
from‘Graham on Dec. 13 that the former head
coach had been contacted by Arizona State
University, and he learned Dec. 14'that Gra-
ham had resigned; _

Co—offensive coordinator Mike Norvell
followed Graham to Arizona State. _

Former Pitt tight ends coach Tony Dews,
secondary coach Tony Gibson and. co—of-
fensive coordinator Calvin Magee accepted
jobs on Rich Rodriguez’s staff at University
of Arizona about a week ago.

Pitt has ﬁve coaches remaining on its staff
for the BBVA Compass Bowl. Quarterbacks
coach Todd Dodge, defensive line coach
Paul Randolph, offensive line coach Spen-
cer Leftwich and special teams/linebackers
coach Randall McCray are all currently still
on staff. _

Patterson said he was not disappointed
by Graham’s move.

“I’m not going to sit here and ever say I am
disappointed in someone that gave me an op-
portunity in this profession to be here.”

Pitt Students React T
When Pitt students heard the news that
Graham accepted the same position he had

had at Pitt at Arizona State, most reacted
with shock. '

Anger followed shortly after.

“It’s literally dumbfounding,” Pitt senior
_].D. Schroeder wrote in a Facebook message.
“For a guy that came in and wanted to change
the program of the ﬁeld as well as on and
preached the Pitt way and talked about com-
mitment and all that, truly a snake. No matter
their performance on the ﬁeld, the players
absolutely do not deserve this.”

The Pittsburgh Post- Gazette reported that
Graham asked Pitt’s assistant athletic director
to forward the news of his decision to leave

for Arizona State in a message to the players .

that read: a _

“Please text this to players please: I have
resigned my position at Pitt in thebest inter-
est of my family to pursue the head coaching
position at Arizona State. Coaching there
has always been a dream of ours and we
have family there. The timing of the circum-

stances have prohibited me from telling you
this directly. I now am on my way to Tempe "

to continue those discussions. God Bless,
Coach Graham.”

Pitt senior Mike Tam wrote in a Facebook
message that he believes Graham should’ve
met with the players before he left.

“The fact that he didn’t call  just shows"

what a spineless coward he is,” Tam wrote.
“Granted, there’s no positive way to tell your
team that you’re bolting for ASU, but you have
to do that in person.”

Sophomore Jonathan Coltogirone said
that the Pitt football program needs to ﬁnd
stability. . ' .

“Initially, I was stunned just like everyone
else,” Coltogirone said. “It really came outgof
nowhere.” .

‘ Sophomore Neal Donnelly said it’s disap-

pointing that the team will have to go through .

the process of implementing a new coach’s
system again.

“This season was rough on the program

because “we had a new coach implementing
a new system, which gave us a disadvantage
simply from the learning curve,” he said.
?‘Now we have to go through the process all
over again.” » 1 l

Freshman Kevin Wolf hadn’t heard the
news until asked for his reaction.

“In high school, we had a football coach
that did that,” Wolf said. “He actually went
to a school in Arizona. He didn’t tell any of
his players. He just left. Yeah, that’s a skeezy
thing to do.” _

Several students said the move was most
surprising because Graham decided to leave

would leave after one season at 6-6 astounds
me.” I ' I
' Sophomore Robert Zanella agreed.

“I actually expected him to leave for a bet-

ter job, but not thissoon,” Zanella said. “I

about the importance of integrity and building
relationships with his players. ~

‘ ‘What webring is relationship,” Graham
said inseptember. “Kids know if you’re genu-
ine, they know if you care about them.”

The difference between Graham’s rhetoric
and his current actions has left some students
more disappointed thanangry. I

‘ A “He’s been preaching about doing things

the ‘Pitt way’ all season and talked about hav-
ing character,” sophomore Darrenwilliams
said. “I’m just disappointed in Todd Graham
as ap_erso_n.”

Introduction at Arizona State

Pitt fans probably felt a little bit of dejavu
after listening to Graham’s introductory press
conference at Arizona State on Dec. 14. r

In his ﬁrst press conference as a Sun Devil,
Graham used some familiar phrases, speaking
of building relationships with players, a high-
octane offense and the ‘Sun Devil way.” ,

“Players know if you’re genuine, they know
if you care them,” Graham said. “We’re going

- to treat our players-with tremendous respect

 I’m a hands—on coach. I’m about hands—on
relationships. That’s our whole deal is building
thatrelationship.’’ .

In the press conference, Graham ad-
dressed the Pitt players. He said the speed
of the circumstances didn’t allow him any
other option.

through,” Graham said.

He added that he wouldn’t have taken any
other coachingjob.

“I don’t shy away from high expectations,”
Graham said. “I know exactly what I’m inher-
iting and the expectations here.”

from his system and used several phrases
nearly identical to those he used when he

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Panthers lose three straight over winter break

Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editor

Forthe ﬁrst time in" more than a.
decade, the Pitt men’s basketball
team started the Big East Confer-

/.,,ence season with two consecutive

losses.

The Panthers, who are in the
midst of a three-game losing streak,
haven’t started conference play with
two straight losses since the 1999-
2000 season.

For more than 10 years, Pitt has
been a staple in the Top 25 and at
the top of the Big East Conference.
But the Panthers fell out of the Top
25 for the ﬁrst time in 40 weeks on
Monday and are currently at the

m— bottom of the Big East standings.

Pitt’s depleted roster doesn’t
help - the Panthers are playing

without starting point guard Travon ,

l’. oodall, who suffered an abdomi-
nal tear and groin strain earlier this
season, and freshman center Khem

Birch, who left the program after 10-

games at Pitt. .

Pitt started the season shooting
well, particularly from the outside,
but during _its three-game losing
streak the Panthers are shooting

x-K16.7 percent from beyond the arc.

Leading scorer Ashton Gibbs
—— one of the nation’s top 3-point
shooters last season —— has hit just
three shots from beyond the arc
during the losing streak.

Malcolm Gilbert quickly became a
fan favorite on Dec. 17.

The Panthers defeated South

freshman starting center Khem
Birch — a McDonald’s All—American
—— decided to leave the program.
As a result, 6-foot-11 freshman
center Gilbert played for the ﬁrst
time since seeing the ﬂoor for a min-

" "” ute against Long Beach State in Pitt’s

third game of the season.

Gilbert provided the Panthers
with depth inside in the ﬁrst half,
but he didn’t see the floor in the sec-
ond half. After entering the game to

ﬁnished the game with two points
and one rebound.
He ended the ﬁrst half with a

powerful dunk that gave the Pan-
thers a 31-26 advantage at the break
and excited the depleted Oakland
Zoo student section.-

Redshirt sophomore Talib Zanna
performed well inside in Birch’s ab-
sence, ﬁnishing with a double-dou-
ble — 12 points and 14 rebounds.

“In preseason, he was our best
big guy,” Pitt head coachJamie Dix-
on said. “He’s given us really good
minutes. I’m very comfortable with
him and what he’s doing.”

Pitt struggled for most of the
game, pulling away with a 12-3 run
in the second half to build a 46-37
lead with 11:24 remaining. "

After the Bulldogs pulled within
two points, 36—34,J0hnJohnson hit
two foul shots, and Lamar Patterson

KhalifToombs answered with a
3-pointer for South Carolina State,
but then Johnson and J._]. Moore

each scored a layup, and Zanna ,

added a tip-in to boost the score
to 48-37. '

The Panthers maintained a com-
fortable lead for the remainder of
the game. _.
' Patterson scored a career—high
16 points, grabbed six rebounds and
dished out three assists.

“I just want to be“aggressive,v

stay conﬁdent in myself. And my

Patterson said. “I just want to be

Pitt handily defeated St. Francis
University on Dec. 20.

Moore and Taylor led Pitt to the
71-47 win with 14 and 15 points, re-
spectively.

The Panthers, who entered the
game leading the nation in rebound-
ing margin (12), continued their
dominance on the glass against St.
Francis. Pitt outrebounded the Red
Flash 42-21. ‘

The Panthers jumped out to an
early 23-point lead against the Red
Flash, who entered the game shoot-
ing 48 percent from the ﬁeld. St.
Francis missed its ﬁrst eight shots
of the game, and Pitt held the Red
Flash to 35 percent shooting.

It took St. Francis more than six
minutes to score its ﬁrst points.

Pitt was able to slow the game
down and get the ball in the paint to

both Taylor and Moore. Easy layups _

and thunderous dunks by both play-

ers contributed to _the 44-16 scoring

advantage for Pitt in the paint.
with starting point guard Wood-

all still out and Gibbs having a rela-
tively quiet night with nine points,
Pitt looked once again to the con-
tributions of others.

Patterson shot 4-7 from the ﬁeld
and collected 11 points, while Tay-

Gilbert and Zanna each saw min-

Wagner head coach  Hur— *

ley told his players to make sure
their phones were charged after

the Seahawks defeated. the then-

No. 15 Pitt men’s basketball team
on Dec. 23.

He said they could expect plenty
of calls and texts after Wagner’s 59-
54 victory at the Petersen Events
Center —- the Panthers’ second loss
in the building this season.

After losing just one nonconfer—
ence game in the Petersen Events
Center before this year — to Buck-
nell in 2005 — Pitt lost two noncon-
ference games in its home building
this season. S .

‘ “Everybody wants to beat atop-
ranked team,?’ Wagner’s Kenneth’

Ortiz said. “We had our chance,
and we made the best of it. [Latif
Rivers and I] talked about thisour
whole life  about how we wanted
to do big things. Hopefully we keep

. it going.”

Wagner hadn’t beaten a ranked
opponent since 1978, and Pitt en-
tered the game 70-0 against North-
eastern Conference opponents.

Pitt junior Taylor said that both
Wagner and Long Beach State ~— the
other team to beat the Panthers at
home this season — came in and

played with more intensity than‘

their host. .

“We let them rush us on a lot of
things instead of taking our time,”
Taylor said.

Dixon called‘ the loss “disap-

“I can’t really point to a lot of

Freshman Khem Birch leaves program

Isaac Saul & Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editors

Football coach Todd Graham wasn’t the only
high-proﬁle member of Pitt’s athletics pro-
gram to depart over winter break. '

Pitt announced on Dec. 16 that freshman
men’s basketball player Khem Birch decided
to leave theprogram for personal reasons
after 10 games with the Panthers.

After Pitt’s win over_ South Carolina State
on Dec. 17, Pitt head coach Dixon said he re-
ceived‘ no indication that Birch was consider-
ing leaving the program until two days before
his departure. , . _ V j ’ V

“We had a lot of conversations all through-

was] just trying to get?a»=feel;for  

-thinking andjoking with about diﬁferent: 

things. It was really within the last two days,
no question about it. That’s when it ﬁrst came
about.” : °

Birch, a McDonald’s All—American, had
been on the rise.  .

_This season, the 6—foot—9 shot-blocking
machine averaged 15 minutes, 4.4 points, ﬁve
rebounds and 1.9 blocks per game. He ﬁnished
with a career—high 11 rebounds against Robert
Morris on Nov. 27. He was just the third fresh-
man to start for the team in Dixon’s nine years
head coach. -

Panthers need to step up. '

' If Pitt releases Birch from his scholarship,
he will be eligible to play at another school two
semesters from now.

ESPN’s Dave Telep reported onjan. 2 that
Birchfs mother, Wendy Sparks, told him that
Birch will visit Florida, New Mexico State and
University of Nevada-Las Vegas this week
and take more visits next week, possibly to
Gonzaga and Oregon State.

Dixon said that he doesn’t anticipate that
Birch will return to the Panthers.

“We’ve got a number of players here that
are excited to be here,” Dixon said. “Our suc-
cess has been based on kids who love to live in
the city of Pittsburgh. They love being here and
they love the University of Pittsburgh. That’s
where our success will continue to be.”

After the game against South Carolina
State, Redshirt sophomore Lamar Patterson
said that the Panthers are worried about their
season, not Birch’s departure. .

“I just wish“the best for him,” Patterson
said. “He was part of the team, and I guess
he’s not now. We just got to worry about us
now.” ~

Staff Writer

Though it was close at some points, the Pitt"

women’s basketball team enjoyed more suc-
cess over the winter break than the men
did.

The women Panthers won three of four
games over the holidays, improving their re-
cord to 8-6 and 0-1 Big East.

To start the break, head coach Agnus Ber-
enato’s Panthers traveled to Cancun, Mexico,
for the Caribbean Classic regular—season tour-
nament, where they faced Big Ten opposition
in the form of Indiana and Michigan State.

The Panthers got their trip off to an en-
ergetic start with a back—and-forth overtime
victory against the Hoosiers on Dec. 20.

The win was Berenato’s 150“ at the helm of

After jumping out to a 12-point ﬁrst-half

1-of-7 from the 3-point line.

He was the only Pitt player to reach double
ﬁgures. ‘

Patterson said the Panthers were impatient
and rushed their offense. '

“[Woodall] would’ve helped a lot today
with the pressure,” Patterson said. “He’s also
our leader. He calms us down out there. I think
that was the problem; we got a little ahead 0
ourselves.” ‘

Pitt went into the break trailing 29-25 and
didn’t take the lead in the second half. The
Seahawks held a 12-point advantage with 12:01
left in the game.

The Panthers trimmed the Wagner lead
to three on several occasions, including with
nine seconds left in the game, but turnovers
on key possessions kept Pitt from tying the
game or taking the lead.

Pitt 59, Notre Dame 72

The Pitt men’s basketball team’s continued
struggles led to its second consecutive loss
on Dec. 27. ' _.

The Panthers underwhelmed both offen-
sively and defensively in their 72-59 loss at
Notre Dame in the Big East opener.

The return of starting point guard Woodall,
who came off the bench, didn’t help.

Pitt gave up an early 19-12 lead in the ﬁrst I
half but still managed to go into the break

with a 26-25 advantage. _

But while the Panthers kept the score close
in the ﬁrst half, Notre Dame shot 72 percent
after the break —— including from 62.5 per-
cent from the 3-point line —— to pull away in
the second.

Notre Dame claimed the advantage for
good on an Alex Dragicevich layup with 17:03
left in the game.

The Fighting Irish hit three consecutive
3-pointers in the second half to boost their
50-42 lead to 59-44,, and the Panthers never
recovered. . ~ 

Pitt, a team traditionally known for its
defense, allowed Notre Dame open looks from
the perimeter and easy layups the paint.

Notre Dame shot 50.9 percent from the
ﬂoor and 36.8 percent from beyond the arc
while the Panthers shot 40 percent from the
ﬁeld and a dismal 7.1 percent from beyond
the arc.

Johnson made Pitt’s only 3—pointer.

i’ Three Notre Dame starters reached dou-
ble ﬁgures. Dragicevich led the Irish with 22
points while Eric Atkins andjerian Grant each
added 15 points. Jack Cooley ﬁnished with
eight points and 14 rebounds.

Pitt 63, Cincinnati 66

Pitt had two attempts to tie the game with
seconds remaining, but the_Panthers were
unable to convert a 3—pointshot and lost their
third consecutive game on Sunday night.

, The.66—63 loss to Cincinnati marked the
ﬁrst time the Panthers have lost three straight
games since the 2007-2008 season.

Cincinnati’s Jaquon Parker missed the
front end of a one-and-one with 28 seconds
left, and Pitt grabbed the rebound. But fresh-
man guard Johnson attempted to drive the
hoop and got called for the charge, turning
the ball back over to Cincinnati-

Cincinnati’s defense and pressure.

The Bearcats ﬁnished the night with 11
steals and scored 20 points off 17 Pitt turn-
overs.

Dixon said that Pitt needs more players to
create shots with penetration.

“We need to get more penetration, I think,
and get to the basket more,” Dixon said. “We’re
not getting enough of it. We don’t have enough
guys getting other guys shots with penetra-
tion. That’s something we were doing bet-
ter earlier in the year that we aren’t doing
now.”

Johnson was the only Pitt player able to
consistently drive into the lane and create
plays throughout the game. Dixon said the

' Panthers ran a play to getjohnson in the lane

on the second to last possession.

After playing off the bench against Notre
Dame, starting point guard Woodall didn’t
play against Cincinnati as he’s still recovering
from an ‘abdominal tear and groinstrain he
suffered earlier this season.

Pitt struggled defensively as well. The
Bearcats shot 48 percent in the second half,
including 50 percent from the 3-point line.

Robinson said that Pitt needed to perform
better defensively, and Gibbs added that the
Panthers have played “so—so defense” so far
this season.

“[We need to] keep practicing,” Robinson
said. “Don’t hang our heads. Move on to the
next game, and try to learn form our mistakes.
We had some good practices this week.” -

Mbodj and 6—foot—9 Yancy Gates — due to
suspensions stemming from the ﬁght against
Xavier, continued with its small, four—guard
lineup against the Panthers.

Dixon said he emphasized the importance
of getting the ball inside this week, particu—
larly with the Panthers’ shooting struggles on
the perimeter. He said the Panthers wanted
hit shots inside and out.

“We had some really good looks that we
didn’t knock down,” Dixon said. “We ran a
lot of plays for Nasir [Robinson] and Dante
[Taylor] against the zone. We got some inside
touches, but we didn’t ﬁnish as well as we
wanted to.” _

Taylor, Pitt’s starting center, ﬁnished with
two points but grabbed 11 rebounds. After
power forward Zanna suffered a blow to the
face and nose during the ﬁrst half, starting
power forward Robinson was forced to play"
at the center position. ‘

Zanna experienced concussion-like symp-
toms and didn’t return to the game.

Against the undersized Bearcats, the Pan-
thers should’ve been ‘able to take advantage
inside, something that Cincinnati coach Mick
Cronin said he anticipated. But Pitt scored
just two more points than the Bearcats in the
paint (30 to 28). I

The Panthers will look to end their three-
game losing streak at DePaul on Thursday.

“We can’t make excuses,”.Dixon said. “We ‘
have the guys to get it done.”

Entering the Women’s version of the

athree—game winning streak and as newly

crowned Caribbean Classic champions, the _

young Panthers suffered a letdown at home
against the Dukes on Dec. 28.

After a tight start, Duquesne used a 13—1_

“They came out and capitalized on the -

mistakes that we made, setting the tone for
