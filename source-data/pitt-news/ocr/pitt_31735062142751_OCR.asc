ed by the Interfraternity council

possible, so that we can promote

friendly relations among the tra-

cause for celebration since the
banquet, like the fraternities it
brings together, is returning to
the campus a..ter four years of in-
activity. - V

yet been chosen, but they will
probably be selected from the
;group,oi" University administra-
‘tive oﬂicers and faculty members
attending.’ Included in this group
are: Dr.’ Rufus H. Fitzgerald,
chancellor; Theodore W. Biddle,
dean of men; Ned Mclntosh, as-
sistant to the dean oi‘ men; Dr.
VVi1liam R. ‘Farmer. U.iiversit.y

shortages in Pittsburgh parallel» those in the rest of the -country,
_ and the Pitt man ﬁnds himself in the same dilemma that hounds
, campus men throughout the nation.

Never a c_l0thes—crazy school of the Harvard-Princeton variety,

Q the University is today, more than¢'
ever, a meeting ‘ place of moder-

ately-dressed young men. Sport

,.dant, with the tuck shop crowd

leaning toward. matched sports
clothes or dressy double breasteds,
but a highvpercentage of the stu-
wear open-necked sport
shirts, bright sweaters, loafer
jackets, or plaid shirts.

The trend seems to be toward
ease and "comfort in clothing
rather than a crusade for the
“sloppy Joe” college styles. of
the ’30’s. How much of the cur-

rent “dressing down”, is a direct
_ result of the clothing shortage re-

mains to be seen. .
Meanwhile, college magazines

when smarter clothing will be in

survey of what the best dressed
are wearing might stir the wish-1
ful imagination of those who stare

give up hope.

A moderate wardrobe of bet-
ter brands, selected with good
taste and prudent thought toward
wear. serves adequately, and
leaves a little green for living
expenses and the social side.
Starting at the bottom with;
shoes, the foundation for style

rich solid colors are best for

Styles are bolder and bolder,

principles of matching must be;

for you who prefer chapeaus, keep
in mind that crown proportions

And here, a closing reminder

to pay more for better brands.

Harvey Rosenblatt

Pre-Med has
Paper Route  

With a Chemistry book in one
hand and a bundle of Pittsburgh
Presses in the other, Harvey Ros-
enblatt, a pre-med student at Pitt,
can be seen making his daily de-
liveries in the East End district.

Newsboy Rosenblatt is working
his way through college to a medi-
cal career. “Junior,” as his friends
call him, has made a success of his
newspaper route, which consists
of between 180 to 200 deliveries
a day.

Last Tuesday evening eighteen-
year-old Harvey got nation-wide
notice as a guest of the popular
radio show ‘Vox Pop’ at Carnegie
hall in Oakland.

“I was a little nervous but I
enjoyed it,” said Harvey, concern-
ing his recent airway venture. Be-
ing quizzed by the Vox Pop
’Twins,’ Parks Johnson and War-
ren Hull was no easy task, but
R-osenblatt was rewarded for his
efforts with a Royal portable type-
writer, a grey tweed suit, and
several hard-to-get white shirts.

tain Boys” will snarl dancers in

square dance numbers such as

ety Lou.” Beside square dance

numbers there will be fox trots,

waltzes, and novelty music.

pants. The more ‘mix-up’ the
more fun we’ll have together.”

A special bus will leave the
Fifth avenue entrance to the Ca-
thedral at 7:15 p. m. for those who
will not travel by cars. Cost for
the trip is $1. John Levendos, in
charge of transportation, . said,
“Everyone going by bus will have
to. be in good voice. because we
will sing our way to South Park.”

Tickets for the affair are on
sale at the booth on the ground
ﬂoor between the hours of 11:30
and 1:30 p. m. Deadline for tick-
et sales is tomorrow, Nov. 27, 1:30

The lodge in South ' Park has
light and heat and can accommo-
date 300 people. A limited num-
ber of tickets are still available.

The dance committee stresses

 

square dance tonight.

Bedeckd in plaids and jeans, Mairy Jayne Von Strohe, Don
Steeb, Ed Zadorozny, and Mary Jane Dunsmoor, have a coke while
they iron out the ﬁnal details for the joint YM—YW old fashioned

Coeds Compete
For Sing Cup

Traditional Interclass Sing is
back again this year.

Jsing the theme, “Once Upon a
Time,” each class will try to Cop
the cup at the Y. M. <3‘; W. H. A.,
Tuesday, Dec. 3, from 11:30 a. m.
to 1:30 p. in.

Pitt women, representing their
own class, will put on skits on
some phase of the Sing’s theme.
In order to be allowed to keep
the coveted gold cup, a class must
win three times. Last year the
freshman (now sophomore) class
was victorious, but th seniors
have won twice before.

Dr. W. George Crouch is chair-
_man of Interclas. Sing this year,
and the judges will be Miss Helen
_Pool Rush, Dr. Auleene. Marley
Jamison, Dr. William Robert
Farmer, and Mr. Roger W. Rus-

" ment. Their decisions will be bas-

 

ed on the originality, enthusiasm,
attendance, and participation of
each class.

expected to be used.

Room No. 358% Is
Cathedral’s Busiest

Hidden away on a third floor
hall that is neither well lighted
nor much-frequented is the nerve
center of the University's tele-
phone system. The room number
‘is 358% and its size corresponds
to the ﬁgure. It is the little known
domain of the University tele-
phone operators. ‘

Several of the most harried in-
dividuals at Pitt are these switch-
board operators. Chief among
them is Mrs. Anne Flaherty
Laughrey, as Irish as her name
and possessor of an inherent tem-
per which she has mastered in the
process of developing “the sweet-
est telephone voice in the world.”
.Anne, as she is known to students
and faculty, began her career with
Pitt in March, 1918, and has stay-
ed with the University through
good times and poor ever since.

Work Long Hours

Assisting Anne in keeping the
chatter ﬂowing are Mrs. Irene
Zemba, Miss Cathlene Holland, a
student assistant. and Mrs. Cath-
rine Joyce, the evening operator.

The switchboard operates from
8:30 each morning until 11:00 at
night and, throughout the daylight
hours, the lines are jammed with
an unprecedented volume of calls.
Last spring a survey was conduct-
ed by the Bell Telephone com-
pany to determine the average
number of daily calls but, as yet,
the results of the tabulations have
not been made known to the Uni-
versity operators. Anne proffers

dent congress regulations.

the possibilities that the statisti-
cians left their work unﬁnished
to enter comfortable homes for
the insane or-that so many adding‘
machines were worn into scrap
that the project was abandoned as
being financially unsound.

Suﬁ’ice it to note that during
the vacation engendered by the
power strike the switchboard han-
dled a grand total of 13,057 calls,
all of them inquiries on the re-
sumption of classes —- this aside
from the regular administrative
trafﬁc that did not abate consid-
erably during the emergency shut-

down.

Through the course of her 28
years with the University, Anne
has been asked to spell words that_
would puzzle a philologist, recite
oft-hand the scores of football
games that were played at the
turn of the century, and corrobor-
ate “Information Please” when
local listeners disagree with ac-
cepted answers to questions. De-
spite the fact that the queries
serve to break the monotonous
routine, Anne and her cohorts
wish that the general public would
rid itself of the notion that a tele-
phone girl is a human reference

N arrates Lives

Of Biographers

Dr. George S. Carver, pi‘«m‘><‘;Ol‘
oi English at the Uni.ve1‘si1._v has
turned a neat trick. In \Vl‘li'l’l,.j the

~biographies of 23 great ”;~,i<~gra-

phers he has bet,-on"e a super-nar-
rator of the lives of timse who
wrote the lives of‘ others.

In a new book, "Alma; for Ob-

livion, he has depicted \.vr.€i+~:'s of"

biography during 12 cemai--‘es of
English literature. Out 0 the vast
material he had to draw on he
selected only those who hat. con-
tributed towards the Clev.:.ln_:*rnent
of biography as a literary tforin.

However, many he writes about
were not merely writers «at? vitae
and literary percursors. Same he
portrays have also created such
masterpieces as The Vicar of
Wakefield, The Compleat Arngler
and Sartor Resartus.

Sir Thomas More, for iilS‘tt~1llC(3,
was not only the author of "Utopia.
but was also the biographer of
King Richard III. Isaak Walton
of Compleat Angler fame wrote
the lives of ﬁve notable; and
Oliver Goldsmith three. Thomas
Carlyle attained stature not only
for Sartor Resartus but for his
life of John Sterling which Dr.
Carver calls “one of the most
sympathetically understanding of
biographies.”

Aims for Oblivion is on the
1946 list of the Bruce Publishing
Company, Milwaukee Its auth-
or’s approach is invigorating and
crystal clear. One of the most
formidable of today’s stylists, Dr.
Carver has long had reputa-
tion as a purist and an authority
on the essay and biography.

Sports-Minded “Clip”

Man-about-sports, .that’s “Clip” Cloughtery.

Football, basketball, baseball-—he’s had a hand in all of
them, and a mighty good hand at that. And now that he’s gradu-
ating from college, “Clipper” is looking forward to making a
career of athletics. Teachingphysical education and coaching
are the plums he’s ripening for future eating.

The stocky Pitt center amassedn
a great record at Swissvale high.
He captained both the football and
basketball teams in junior high,
and is the only athlete in the his-
tory of Swissvale that led b-oth
the gridiron and hard-court en-
tries during his senior year.

His great work was rewarded
when he was chosen on the A1-
legheny '- Kiski All — tournament
basketball team in 1937.

St. Vincent’s college was the
next stop on Clip’s sports trail. He
changed from a back to his pres-
ent position at center while play-
ing for the Bobcats. The middle
slot is his choice spot, for as Clip
says, “You’re backing up the line,
you always know what’s going
on, and you always have your _ ,
hands mn the ball.” , “ , ”

at Pitt. '

Figure-eight in continuity
sounds like a lot of Greek to the
laymen of basketball, but in re-
ality it is one of the most intri-
cate systems ever devised in the
cage sport. Basically,
tinuity is a reverse oifense. To the
spectator it looks like ﬁve men
on a merry-go-round moving like
a ﬁgure-eight.

Dr. Carlson is truly an advo-
cate of fundamentals in basket-
ball. Toward this end, he has
molded a combination of players,
using basic fundamentals, into an
effective atta ckin g maneuver
through the use of the ﬁgure eight.

The main purpose of the ebu-
tinuity is to get a man loose so
he can get an unobstructed shot

at the basket from point—b1ank

range.

“I ‘like ‘Coach Fesler’s system,”
Clip reports, “Especially his em-

blocking. The team is one of the
best I’ve ever played with; size
and inexperience are the ‘only
things that kept them do'wn.”

Pen State Tmhled p 1) Panthers

., .- ‘?.\"

O

Scoring two ‘touchdowns on passes against the best pass

defensive team in the country,

the Pitt Panthers downed the

Nittany'Lions from Penn State 14-7 at the Pitt Stadium last

Saturday. .

It was the Jungle Cat’s third Victory against ﬁve defeats

and one tie, while the Lions’
campaign. ‘

Pitt’s touchdowns came in the
second and fourth quarters, the
ﬁrst when Carl DePasqua ﬂip-
ped a 38-yard pass to Cecconi on
the 3. Abraham went plunging
over two downs later. The second
score came when DePasqua passed
into the end zone to Leo Sklad-
any. Coury added both extra
points.

State’s score came after little
Elwood Petchel took over the
heavy _duties in the fourth quarter,
and started his teammates on a
touchdown drive. In ﬁve running,
attempts he had it up to the Pan-
ther’s 12. The going got too rough

for him there, and ‘Fullback Bob
Weitzel took over and knifed over
from the one for six points. Ed
converted for the extra
point.

That was the last time for either
team to score, and Wes Fesler
walked off the ﬁeld a much hap-
pier coach-than before the game,
when his team were 7-5 under-
dogs.

Afterthoughts

The Panther gridders were ju-
bilantly received after the game.
Immediately following the ﬁnal
gun, many in the student body
rushed onto the ﬁeld and congrat-
ulated their winning squad. A
few of the Pitt players were car-
ried off the ﬁeld on the shoulders
of their teammates and friends.

Co—Captain Jack Durishan was
one of the last men oﬁ the ﬁeld.
Durishan was almost completely
surrounded with well-wishers and
friends.

The 50,000 crowd was the best
the Pittmen have played to at the
stadium this year. It was a ﬁne
tribute to a ball-club, who though
not a winner, thrilled the fans
throughout the year.
