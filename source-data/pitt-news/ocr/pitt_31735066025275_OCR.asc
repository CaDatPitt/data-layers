Philosopher
shares ideas

on Zen inWest

By Gary Knapick

Senior Staff Writer

Within all of us, meshed with the tissues
of our brains through our synapses, is a
soul that yearns to be free. Free of mental
cloudiness. Free from the bondage of
organized religion and societal training.

Truth is not found in the preachings of
other humans or in the pages of their great
holy books. Instead, the soul’s search for
the ultimate reality culminates in satori, or
enlightenment, said Zen philosopher,
lecturer and author Richard Rose.

Rose, who spoke Thursday night at
Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall, said he
believes that everyone has the capacity to
attain this state in life and, ultimately, in
death. Rose,. who is a founder of the Truth
and Transmission Foundation, discussed
his interpretation of Zen and its significance
in the west. .

“Knowing something for real is just
going for it,” Rose said. According to Rose,
he represses questioning by imposing
sanctions on those who do.

“When I first started to question my
parents about religion, I got slapped. That
was blasphemy, they’d say. It wasn’t
blasphemy. It was a child startingldown
the path to truth.

“We don’t teach our children to
question,” Rose said. “I never wanted
power, I just wanted truth. I wanted to
know, ‘Is there a God?’_, ‘Is there an

Student Government Board members
Jacob Brody and Ross Pasquale apologized
at Friday’s meeting to the board and to
students for breaking SGB policy when
they appointed former Pitt News sports
editor Rob Mazur to the Senate Budget
Policies Committee without the approval
of the board.

At Friday’s open meeting, SGB President

-Gil Golden assured students such an

incident would not happen again.

“It was an oversight. It was, in fact,
against our constitution. It was noted, and
it won’t happen again, and the situation
will be corrected shortly,” Golden said.

After giving their weekly reports, both
Brody and Pasquale addressed the issue.

“It was a simple oversight. Everything is
in The Pitt News,” Brody said, referring to
an article that appeared in The Pitt News
on March 26. In it Brody said there was a

mixup in paperwork because Golden did
not receive any notice of the action and
that simple oversights by both Pasquale
and himself had occurred because they
did not inform other board members and

V did not follow SGB procedure.

“It was a temporary thing, and I looked
upon it as saying, ‘Could you attend these
meetings in my place,’ because I could not
attend them at that time,” Brody said.

Specialized television networks
like ESPN and CourtTV represent
a challenge to a common cultural
identity, according to CBS
executive Jay Rosenstein.

Rosenstein, the vice president
of programming at CBS and a
former Pitt News sports editor,
spoke at the Student Publications
Board annual banquet Saturday
night.

He spoke about the continuing
need for broad programming,
designed to reach many people
and also the threatwhich specialty
networks pose to that need. He
said the more specialized that
programminggets, the larger the
gaps between people will
become.

“Advertisers are looking for
specific and narrow audiences,”

Rosenstein said. “We find
programming being developed
for supermarket check—out lines,
for doctors’ offices, for airline
terminals. We find that radio
formats are carefully tailored:
women 18-24 [years old], men
25-34 and so on, with all different
kinds of music, sports and talk.”

Rosenstein defined the mass
media as free, over—the—air
television, newspapers and
general circulation magazines,
and emphasized the importance
of delivering programming with
a wide focus.

“This is called, in my business,
broad—casting, to a broad
audience, not narrow-casting to
a narrow audience,” he said.
“There is a role for narrow—castin g,
there is a role for niche magazines
and newspapers, to be sure. But
we have to have, as a nation,
shared experiences.”

Rosenstein stressed the need
for communication between
people and based that interaction
on common events they
experience, like watching a
popular television show or
reading a newspaper.

“Ifwe don’t have that, we’ll be
split 50 different ways,” he said.
“Our cultures will be separated
from each other, the rich will be
separated from the poor. Religious
and ethnic groups will not have
the stability to talk to each other.”

Because of the popularity of
“narrow-casting” shows and the
current economic climate,
networks like CBS might have to
scale down the amou nt of money
which is paid out to acquire the
broadcast rights for certain
sporting events, Rosenstein said.
But he added that he did not
think that major events like the

Gree/es clean up Oa/elana’

By Heather Gahres
Staff Writer

Instead of sleeping in, about 75 Pitt Greeks spent Saturday
morning picking up garbage from the streets of Oakland as part
of Project Oakland Cleanup.
“I think overall [the project] will improve the relations
between the community and the Greeks. We would like to have
a reciprocal relationship with the community,” Panhellenic
Council External Vice President Kristy Hahanfeldt said.
To some, this community-service event was a pleasant break
from the competitiveness of Greek Week.
‘‘I like doing this stuff better than Greek Week because this
emphasizes service and not winning. Nobody does it to win. We
‘do it because it needs to be done,” Eric Hoch said. 9

' Pi Kappa Alpha had 18 members participate in the cleanup
— more than any other Greek organization. T. J. Unger of Pi
Kappa Alpha said, “Oakland is a beautiful place on the inside.
Hopefully we can uncover its beauty by picking up the trash.”

Even though picking up trash does not sound like fun, many
of the participants said they had a good time.

“Despite it being very dirty, we still had fun,” Andrew Klan
said.

This was the first time Project Oakland Cleanup took place. A

baseball playoffs, the Olympic
Games and the Super Bowl would
be available only on a pay-per-
view basis because the American
public would not allow it.

“We must never lose sight of
the value to our society of the
mass media,” Rosenstein said.
“It’s very important to preserve
the very nature of the mass
audience.”

Rosenstein said the future of

the television business is very
uncertain because of the intense
competition between pay and

" free television. Currently, several

sporting events, such as boxing
and professional wrestling, use
the pay—per-view format.

“But according to the law of
the constitution I know  it should
have been brought to the board.
Unfortunately, it slipped our

minds to do that, and we
apologize to the board for this
breach of policy,” Brody said.

Pasquale also apologized.

“I can assure you that such an
oversight will not reoccur, and I
would welcome comments from
any concerned students who had
opinions on this issue,” Pasquale
said. i

The 1992 Greek Sing winners
were Kappa Kappa Gamma and
Delta Tau Delta.

Kappa Kappa Gamma, which

C also won last year’s Greek sing,

sang songs from the musical
Nunsense, including “Turn Up
the Spotlight,” “We’re Just a
Couple of Sisters” and “Tackle
that Temptation with a Timestep. ”
The women’s costumes and
choreography made their act a
success.

“When they got to number two

and they hadn’t named our house, ’

I didn't think we placed. I was so
happy,” Susan Gruss of Kappa
Kappa Gamma said.

Delta Tau Delta won for its
tribute to Broadway. The
members sang “Give My Regards
to Broadway,” “Hey Look Me
Over” and “Step to the Rear.” The
men’s dance routine included
throwing brothers into a back
flip.

“We started practicing in mid-
January. There were a lot of good
acts. I feel we were as good as
anybody, and it’s all due to the
tutelage of Ted Schroeder and
Mike Bowers,” Donald Young of
Delta Tau Delta said. '

Pi Kappa Alpha, which was not
judged, was the only act to receive
a standing ovation. Steve Donofe,

Over 700 danceforclmrity

By Heather Gahres
stag Writer

Over 750 Greeks danced for 12 hours at Metropol last night
during the final Greek Week event. » A
Dance Marathon started at_1O a.m. and lasted until 10 p.m.
The dancers had to keep in constant motion. Each time a
contestant was caught not moving, a check was placed on their
sign. After dancers accumulated three checks, they were
disqualified from the event. ,
“IFIJI members] are just trying to have fun. We're the ones
with spirit. We’re getting things started and breaking up the
monotony,” Brett Freeman said. _
Two years ago the marathon lasted for 24 hours, but since the
Greeks moved to Metropol they have had to cut the event down

V to 12 hours.

V “Two years ago I danced in the 24-hour one. [Twelve hours]
really is not that big of deal, and they’re giving us a lot of breaks.
But I would have rather been at home sleeping this morning,”
Lori White, the Panhellenic Association president, said.

. Inter-Fraternity Council secretaryjoe Bowman had a suggestion
about the music played. “They should have played all slow
songs, so I wouldn’t have to dance so fast.”

Although many of the participants were exhausted, they kept
moving throughout the dance.

“It’s a pretty good experience because it's, for a good cause.
I’m exhausted, but I’d do it again,” Mike Bertin said.

“I think the fact that the Greeks will dance 12 hours straight I

shows the dedication [the Greeks] have for our charity,” Keith
Kolody said. ‘
“I’ve enjoyed Greek Week immensely. Greek Week is a time

for_unity and to help our fellow man, in example United ,

Cerebral Palsy. If I had to do it all over, I wouldn’t hesitate in
saying yes to it,” Fabian Ardila said. ,

Although Greek Week was fun for most participants, many
said theyare glad that it’s over.

Carol Everett spoke at Pitt last

, week to explain why she left her

job at an abortion clinic to
become a pro-life activist.

Everett said she was employed
in four abortion clinics where
she said she helped perform
over 35,000 abortions. She said
she has been on both sides of the
issue, but she “has seen the light”
and is now actively pro—life after
witnessing the “killing and
maiming of women and babies.”

Everett argued that abortion is
more detrimental to women and
society than it is helpful.

“Women need and deserve
answers,” she said. “Women will
not abort when they know it’s
real life they are killing.”

‘‘It is not debatable when life
begins. From the moment the
23-chromosome sperm and the
23-chromosome egg unite, they
form a unique human being,”
according to Everett, who said in
her clinics, fetuses were referred
to as “products of conception.”

Everett’s comments were met
with disagreement by Kathleen
Carrick, a master’s candidate in
social work at Pitt.

Carrick said in her job as a
counselor in an abortion clinic
she advises women on all of
their options, including marriage,
single-parenting and adoption
in addition to abortion.

After seeing many neglected
and abused children in her job as
a social worker, Carrick said she
has become pro—choice.

“My only fear about abortion
is that someday I’ll get blown up
at work,” Carrick said.

p Pro—lifer speaks at Pitt

Everett also discussed the
adverse mental and physical
effects that women who have
had abortions suffer.

Everett claimed that of all
women who choose abortions,
91 percent have post-abortion
syndrome. These women
experience emotional trauma that
may manifest itself in the form of
eating disorders, promiscuity or
a variety of other disorders. She
said that 75 percent of
relationships are destroyed
within 90 days after an abortion,
citing her own divorce after she
had an abortion as an
example.

“The lucky ones are the ones
who admit they’ve killed a baby.
They can grieve and heal
themselves,” Everett said.

Physical problems also occurr
as a result of an abortion, she
said.

According to Everett,
perforated uteruses occur in 1
percent of all abortions. She
added that 25 percent of all
women who have abortions
experience complications with
future pregnancies; some even
become sterile. -

Many audience members
applauded, but a few questioned
the safety of back—alley abortions
that they feel will become
common if abortion is
outlawed.z

Everett said she believes back-
alley abortions will continue if
Roe v. Wade is overturned, but
they will be safer due to the
development of safer
instruments.

Everett did not give her official

title at the clinic, nor did she list 2

specific duties.

Pitt’s Amnesty International, Amnesty
International’s Pittsburgh Group 39 and State
Representative Frank Pistella are focusing on a
common goal next week — to convince the
Pennsylvania Legislature to prohibit the death
penalty for juvenile offenders.

Amnesty International, a human rights
organization advocating freedom from
imprisonment and torture of prisoners of
conscience world—wide, opposes the death
penalty in'all cases.

Geraldine Malmberg, Amnesty Group 39’s
president said that Pennsylvania is one of six
states targeted in the campaign against the
execution of juveniles.

According to Malmberg, the U.S. is the only
industrialized western nation to still have the
death penalty. Capital punishment is no longer
used in Europe and was abolished in Great
Britain in 1965.

Malmberg added that in a recent Amnesty
report, more juvenile offenders have been
executed in the United States than any other
country except Iraq and Iran.

“The U.S. is flouting international standards by
sentencing juvenile offenders to death.
International covenants [have been] signed, but
not ratified by the U.S., [that] outlaw the execution
of juvenile offenders.”

Malmberg said,”It is considered cruel and
unusual punishment. If you make a commitment
in your mind that it’s wrong to kill, it doesn’t
matter who is killed. There have been no
statistics that prove the death penalty is a crime
deterrent. The state approves the use of violence
as an approved means of punishment. it’s really
more like revenge.” ' 5 A

According to Malmberg, there here has never
been an age limit for the de-ath penalty ‘in
Pennsylvania. However, she said that a bill
raising the execution age requirement to 18 has
been passed in the Senate and is currently being
reviewed in the House Judiciary Committee,

Pitt's AI President, Ronna Lash said, “Mentally

THE PI'I'I‘ NEWS, Monday, March 30, 1992

Groups u/or/e toﬁg/otjuz/em'le death penalty

ill, mentally retarded and people with IQ’s below
70 have been executed in Pennsylvania. That
fact doesn’t even come up in their trials.”

Lash said that next week Al is presenting a
Death Penalty Awareness Week in the William
Pitt Union. “On Friday we’re planning a write—a—

' thon to generate letters to inﬂuence Pennsylvania

legislators about this issue.”

Pistella said he is opposed to the state executing
juvenile -offenders and introduced legislation to
Congress raising the minimum age to 18 for a
defendant facing a death penalty sentence.

“We’re dealing with. children. They are not yet
developed-emotionally or mentally. I don't think
they are fully aware of the implications of their
actions at the time of the crime,” Pistella said.

As an alternative to the death penalty, Pistella

. advocates life without parole or “stacking the

sentenceby increasing the number of years that
the individual is incarcerated from society.”

Institutionalizing some structure for consistent
representation throughout the entire court pro-
cess, rather than having many different lawyers,
is another issue that Pistella said he is considering.

“It’s always possible that someone sentenced
to death is innocent. There is no way to make
restitution to a family in the case of a mistake,”
Pistella said. _

John Taylor, deputy press secretary for
Governor Casey, said that the governor has
signed death warrants for 14 people since he
took office. “All have been stayed and none of
them involved defendants under the age of 18,”
Taylor said. '

“There are 139 individuals in various state
prisons who have been sentenced by the courts
for the crime of 1st degree murder, 5 were under
the age of 18.7’

“However, in regard to juvenile offenders, the
governor has not taken a position one way or the
other,” Taylor added.

Malmberg said, “We are asking people to
write Governor Casey to express their concern
and opposition to the death penalty in
Pennsylvania especially as it applies to juveniles
under the age of 18 in the commission of a
crime." '

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, March 30, 1992

 

Rose

Continued from page 1
wears a robe.”

At the age of 12, Rose left home
to join a seminary, where he
would spend five years in a
fruitless search for truth. After
that he studied chemistry in
college —— his hopes for
enlightenment all but completely
dashed. .

“I had followed all the
prescriptions for attaining this
truth,” Rose said. He read all the
books he could get his hands on,
sought out teachers of philosophy,
became a vegetarian and even
became celibate.

Not getting any younger, Rose
decided to abandon his quest
and settle down.Soon he was
engaged to a young woman from
Seattle whom he met in Columbus.

Rose was heartbroken when,
upon paying a surprise visit to his
wife—to—be in Seattle, he found
her with a lesbian lover.
Afterward, Rose spent several days
in a motel— reading and thinking.

One morning, as he sat beside
his bed with a book, Rose felt an
incredible pain in the center of
the top of his head.

“I knew it was going to kill me,”
Rose said. As the pain subsided,
Rose felt himself swept out of his
body toward the mountains
surrounding Seattle. From there
he watched in pity as the men
and women below continued to
lead their lives in blind confusion.

“We are, for the most part,
mobile robots with built-in
reﬂexes,” Rose wrote in his book,

The Albigen Papers.

“I knew I had made it. This was
not Earth,” Rose said.

Rose has yet to return to that
elevated state of consciousness
but does travel around the country
interviewingpeople who claim
to have returned from the dead.
He believes that, by virtue of our
humanity, we will all experience
such a state after death.

“You survive death. This I
know. I went there, andl made it
back. Actually,” Rose recalls, “I
was thrown back.”

Rose now sees that his
determination to find
enlightenment is precisely what
prevented him from attaining it.
Rose related this paradox with an
anecdote from his time spent in
an orphanage.

After waking to find the ground
blanketed with fresh snow, Rose
found one of his housemates
with his nose pressed against the
window, saying, “Snow, snow,

' go away, come again some other

day.”

“Why are you saying that?”
asked the young Rose, who was
about to go outside to play in the
newly-fallen snow.

The boy turned to him and
said, “If it thinks we want it to
snow, it won’t.”

When you want to do
something, blocks are thrown in
your way, according to Rose,
who says this is a fundamental
tenet of Zen.

“Some states of mind affect
material,” Rose said.

In another story used to
illustrate this phenomenon, Rose
talked about a night many years
ago when he was playing poker
with several friends. Initially, Rose
lost several hundred dollars, but
by the end of the night, he
recovered three times the amount
he lost — by not caring.

“Before, I cared. I was tense,”
Rose said. “Now, the right cards
just turned up.

 a king comes up, you don’t
care and you don’t get greedy.
And you keep winning,” he said.

“In dice games, peoplecall out
their numbers and they don’t get
them. They felt that by screaming,
something would hear them,”
Rose said.

Rose believes that he is able to
apply this idea to other aspects of
telekinesis. ,

“I have the ability to see through
people and I can see dark spots
where there are infections,” Rose
said. This accounts for the healing
powers associated with certain
enlightened individuals,
according to Rose.

Of course the reliability of a
telekinetic examination is not
always predictable. “If it happens,
it happens. If it doesn’t, it wasn’t
the right time,” Rose said. “The
only way to prove it is to try it,
and you try it by not trying.”

Rose said that those who wish
to attain enlightenment in this life
should be patient.

“It comes slowly, not
overnight,” Rose said. “Don’t go
out hunting for it.

could win prizes. _

Children had the opportunity to throw water balloons at the
Student Government Board members, pick ducks from a duck
pond, play memory games, shoot some hoops and make crafts.

“We’ve had a booth every year and it’s just something we
always volunteer for. It’s part of our community outreach. It’s
rewarding,” said Marta Effinger, representative of the Black
Action Society.

There was also an autographing table where Pittsburgh
Steelers and Pitt Panthers signed autographs and talked with
children.

“I’m glad I came. I really enjoyed coming down, signing
autographs and just talking to the kids. It makes you realize how
fortunate you are,” Pitt basketball player Eric Mobley said.

Many volunteers said they enjoyed the experience and would
definitely be involved next year as well.

“lt’s very fulﬁlling because I don’t think the average college
student gets the opportunity to interact with this population. For
all of the problems college students have, it reminds us how
lucky we are,” SGB member Ross Pasquale, who was a clown
for the day, said.

“I love this. The whole idea of working with kids makes
everything that much more enjoyable. When you see a smile on
their face, that’s what makes your day,” clown Jeff Katchen said.

Pitt Chancellor}. Dennis O’Connor also attended the event.

“I think it’s marvelous. A lot of people putting in a lot ofeffort.

It’s what Pitt students are all about.”

Another act that received loud
cheers was Delta Sigma Phi, which
dressed up as the Muppets. The
group chose its theme while
watching The Muppet Movie.
“[The Muppet theme] is so
perfect. We just regress back to
being a kid, and it brings back
memories,” Scott McKnight said.
“We did a lot of Muppet
research, and we picked the

brothers that fit the parts,” Levi

Sexist ideology in action

‘In American society, women, as a class, are at a low
level. What is striking is that no matter how many laws are
on the books supposedly improving the status of women,
basic dignity and respect are still denied. As last week’s
rape on campus demonstrates, violence against women is
just one dimension of this basic inequality.

Psychologists study male rapists in order to understand
the alarming level of sexual violence in our society. It is
estimated that one in four women will be sexually
assaulted in her lifetime. For millions of women, rape is
a bitter reality.

Hatred of women has no one “cause.” It is produced in
various cultural contexts. Last Thursday’s Greek Sing
offered a perfect example.

Reminiscent of a fraternity show at the University
Michigan that featured whites in blackface marked as

. slaves a few years ago, Phi Kappa Theta’s skit for the

evening event clearly demonstrated hatred and prejudice
— not of African—Americans —_but of the female or the
woman.

It began with a not-too-unusual scenario. A man was

‘courting a woman. The woman was actually a male in

female drag. Her breasts were enormous as well as her
derriere. In the background, the boys sang “Fat Bottom
Girls.” Our male hero attempted to court his woman only
to discover flowers and poetry fail to elicit her affections.
However, a pizza proved successful. She attacked him
and the pizza box. After he carries his woman off stage,
a priest enters with a sign reading, “just Married.”

But marital bliss escaped our hero. A friend asked the
_male newlywed about the holy union, and the husband
responded with moans and complaints. He muttered
words to the effect: it’s terrible, we’re broke, all she does
is eat.

But our hero was not going to ruin his life. He pulled out

a Butterfinger, out jumped his wife, and he announced,
“Nobody better lay a finger on my Butterfinger,” as he shot
his piece of property. The male chorus sang “I used to love
but I had to kill her.”

But not forgetting that women are only good for sex, a
member of the boy’s club entered to read a disclaimer.
The skit was not intended to show contempt for women.
After all, he notes, we think women are soft, pretty and
wonderful, and without them sex would be no fun.

Amused, the audience roared with ‘laughter. By the
audience’s reaction, college students apparently think
that it’s funny to kill “unattractive” women or that women
are only good for sex with men. When one questions a
lack of self—esteem for women in American society, this
incident should/come to mind. _

Whether or not the cast intended the skit to be “just in
good fun” is irrelevant. In the end, it reproduces asexism.
The skit calls into question the standards of the organizing
committee. However, it may be good that this example of
misogyny has come forward. If it’s just below the surface,
itcan grow unchecked.

The United, States’ Constitution’s First Amendment
guarantees freedom of the press, of political discourse
and of the expression of dissenting views. But supporting
the skit participants’ freedom of expression does not limit

our freedom to criticize women-bashing.

Comic book character comes out

Stronger than steel, faster than a speeding bullet,
more socially conscience than Ghandi and coming
out of the comic—book—closet near you, -it’s —
Northstar.

Northstar, one of the muscle-laden Marvel Comic
superheroes, has just broken down one of the last
stereotypes about queers that still remains — that
hyper—men can’t be gay. He joins the ranks of
Hercules, Napoleon, Peter the Great and Alexander
the Great.

In a bold move that takes place in the March issue

Recently the mainstream media has started to
present queer people as they truly are. We are as
diverse as the general population. We are feminine
and butch, liberal and conservative, religious and
not religious. We come fromall racial and ethnic
groups. We, pursue all careers. .We all have goals in
life, and we want to love and get along with others.

But this is not to say that the -battle is not over. It

"started at the beginning of time and has only now

started to. pick up momentum. Northstar, other
queers and our friends must continue -to follow

through with his lead and
challenge society’s misconception
with what is normal. Lesbians
can be mothers, gay men can
play football.gAll queers can be

of their business — I am gay.”

Pretty shocking. Imagine a world if Superman,
Wonder Woman or the Incredible Hulk would
come out. For the Northstar fanatics, it was not a
question of what, but when. To the regular readers
of Alpha Flight, when the bomb was ﬁnally dropped,
it came as no shocking surprise: there have been
clues that have been strategically placed throughout
the series since the start.

But to the general population the news is being
taken as a social indicator of the times. Today gays,
lesbians and bisexuals are more visible than ever
before —-‘not only on campus, at work, at home
and in our own personal lives but on Roseanne, LA.
Law and Northern Exposure. "

Visibility increases also at the comic book counter.

The typical comic book buyer is a teenage or young '

male. This is a group which is not known for its
open-mindedness, but it is still hoped that they will
get some sort of message. Maybe they will realize
that it is all right to be queer —-that the gay, lesbian
and bisexual population is not sick, corrupt and
immoral as ignorance leads them to believe. Or
maybe they will see that not all gay men are
effeminate. Perhaps a couple of readers might even
find security in Northstar and might attribute their
personal coming out to him. g '
But whatever the case, Northstar will definitely
continue to’ fight for the good side. And he (and
others) has brought the battle to a new arena.

military’s importance. We deserve to be able to
fight along the sides of our fellow American brothers
and sisters.

Northstar and the comic-book world has started
to use their inﬂuence to educate and stop the
spread of ignorance, fear and hate. It’s time that the
religious and educational communities do the
same. So many people are touched and reached
under their jurisdiction that their support is necessary.
It is these two institutions thathave smothered our
movement and stopped our freedoms. Yet it is also
these two groups which many queers look to for
personal-support. They should get a clue from

tMarvel Comics. If a comic-book character can

come out and help than the schools and churches
can help too.

Now that Northstar has come out, we will see
what happens. Probably since it has such an
incredible effect on 10 percent of the population,
we will see more gay characters appearing in
comics, on television shows and on the big screen.

"But what is even more empowering than that is that

more people will decide to be more honest with

their sexuality. Nothing hits closer to home when ,

your best friend or brother or sister decides to come
out.
Now if only Batman and Robin would.

The Pitt lacrosse team continued with its
winning ways this past weekend, grabbing
three more wins by a combined score of
61-7 to remain atop the Allegheny Lacrosse
League, unbeaten and in control of its
third straight title.

The victories by Pitt (8-1, 7-0 league) set
the stage for a much-awaited showdown
that will determine this year’s league
championship~Tuesday night at Pitt Stadium
against the Mountaineers from West
Virginia University. The Mountaineers will
also come into the game undefeated. The
game is scheduled to start at 7’ p.m. 1

Thursday night, the Panthers opened up i

a rare home-and-home series with another
cross-town opponent, Duquesne
University, at Pitt Stadium. It was the
Dukes’ season opener, and if they expected
to be treated graciously by their hosts,

theywere in for a rude awakening. The-

Panthers rolled to another easy victory,
21-3.

Pitt opened the game uncharacteristically
strong, getting an early goal by Josh
Gochnauer at only 2:55 of the first period.
Just 3 5 seconds later Chad Lehman doubled
the Panthers’ lead with his first goal of the
game. The lead was soon increased to 5-
0, when Bob Lee netted his goal 10

seconds after Lehman’s.

Although Pitt’s talent was thoroughly
superior to Duquesne’s, the Panthers were
not able to increase their lead, thanks to a
solid effort on the part of the Dukes’
defensive unit and the stellar play of
goaltender Dean Fizzell. _

Pitt spent most of the first quarter on the
power play but could not cash in. The
poor passing and sloppy play that usually
accompanies the team at the beginning of
a game showed its face again, but, as in the
past, the Panthers’ defense held ground,
not allowing the Dukes a single shot on
goal during the period.

Any momentum Duquesne hoped to
have carried into the second period was
dashed when Gochnauer, Brian Barrett
and Luke Fox scored three unanswered
goals in the first two minutes of the new
quarter. At the 5:15 mark, Eric Kaveny
increased the lead to 7-0 with a quick shot
to the top right corner of the net.

With the game well in hand, Pitt’s offense
kept on rolling. Pete Guevara added a

natural hat trick with three straight goals,’

the last of which came at the 14:45 point
of the second on a scoop shot from in front

‘ of the net. With only 15 seconds remaining
in the half, the Dukes got caught looking

ahead to halftime. Pitt won the faceoff,
and Lee Stember buried the team's 11th
goal as time ran out to put the Panthers up

11-1.

The second half offered more of the
same play. Pitt outscored Duquesne 10-2
in the second half, en route to the victory.
Panther goals were scored by Gochnauer
(two), Stember (two), Dave Kounas, Ed
Croot, Kaveny, Harper Watters,'Lehman
and Chris Rice. High scorers for Pitt were
Gochnauer with four goals and two assists,
Stember (three goals, two assists) and
Kaveny (two goals, three assists).

“In games like these, we try not to
develop bad habits,” head coach Gary
Neft said. “We work on the things we do
in practice.”

On Saturday night, in their second
meeting, Pitt defeated the Dukes 18-1 at
_Duquesne.

Next on the menu was Juniata College,
which traveled to Pittsburgh for a Sunday
brunch meeting with the Panthers. From
the start of the game, it was painfully
obvious that Pitt was locked in a game
against another inferior opponent. Thirteen
different players scored goals to lead the
Panthers to a 22-3 victory.

Again the Panthers got out of the gate
early, running up a 10-0 lead by the end of
the first period. Goals were scored by Fox,
Rice, Craig Leslie (two), Croot," Kounas,
Barrett (two), Stember and Steve Grass.

Piic/sing success leads to win over Gannon

By Cory Walborn
Staff‘ Writer “\

Using a host of pitchers last
Thursday, the Pitt baseball team
not only shut down Gannon
University’s batters, but they shut
them out, 10-0.

"On a rain-soaked Trees Field,
the Panthers were led by their
starting ‘pitcher, junior Bill
Junker. After an inning of work,

he was followed by three other"

hurlersz junior Ralph Cerere,
senior Fred Iriti and first—year
player Carl Vollmar. These four

pitchers combined to strike out .
11 Golden Knights’. They only.

allowed four hits throughout
the shortened, seven-inning
game. Iriti led all pitchers with
his four strikeouts in his two
innings on the mound.

“Our pitching has done a good
job for us so far,” Pitt head
coach Mark Jackson said about
his team’s early pitching success.

“We still have to do a better
job of hitting the baseball
though,” Jackson said. The
Panthers had only five hits in
their 10-run rout of Gannon, not
an impressive statistic to any
coach. J ’

Offensively, Pitt got out of the
blocks early with a little help
from the Golden Knights’ starting
pitcher, junior Steve Shubert.
After a lead—off double by
Pantherju nior Al Lardo, Shubert
promptly walked the next four
batters and found his team down
4-0 by the end of the first inning.

Pitt, again aided by walks,
quickly struck in the bottom of
the third.’ Sophomore Greg
Christrnan led the inning off
with a double. After a walk and
a passed ball with runners on
second and third, designated

1 the game atseven innings instead

I gutsy performance from Pitt’s

hitter Jerry Berteotti ripped a
two—run single to give the
Panthers a 6-0 lead.

Shube rt then walked two more
batters, and after a Gannon error
and fielder’s choice, Pitt led 9-0
after three innings.

Later in the ﬁfth inning, while
the Panthers’ pitching staff was '
keeping Gannon hitters guessing,
Pitt first baseman Jason Roth
connected with a Bill Buchna
fastball that left Trees Field in a
hurry. That home run gave Pitt
the 10 runs they needed to end

of a normal nine, thanks to the
10-run rule in college baseball.
The final two innings saw a

first-year pitcher, Vollmar. He
closed out the Golden Knights, ,
allowing only one hit in two
innings of relief.

Pitt’s pitching staff looked
impressive ‘against Gannon, but
its offense seemed to linger like
the cold winds of March. “Once
we start to put our hitting and
pitching together, we will be all
right,” Roth said. “And we will
put it together,” he added.

Roth led the Panthers
offensively, going two for three
with two RBIs. DH Berteotti also
contributed with two RBIs.

The win raised the Panthers’
record to 12-4 with Big East play
approaching quickly. With that
in front of them, Jackson said he
feels his team could improve in
all areas of the game.

“You should be able to play
consistent baseball all the time,”
Jackson said about his team's
u p-and-down performance. “Our
record is good, but we still have
to play better.”

The Panthers play tomorrow
at Trees Field in a double-header

against Miami of Ohio. They
are at home again Wednesday,

THE prrr NEWS, Monday, March 30, 1992

By Stephen 1. Liss
For The Pitt News

Not many people have the
ability to prognosticate

fsuccessfully when it comes to

predicting what team is going to
place where in their respective
sport. You just have to look at
most of last year’s picks to see
that. Almost every preseason
publication had the Dodgers, Mets
and A’s winning, while Atlanta,
Minnesota and St. Louis were
expected to occupy the back of
the bus.

There are, however, several
predictions that always hold true
when it comes to picking the
American League Eastern division:
The Red Sox win in even-
numbered years, and the Indians
always finish last. So without
further adieu, here are predictions
for the 1992 season in the AL
East.

Cleveland Indians:

The 1990 American League
rookie of the year Sandy Alomar

- Jr. and 1991 rookie phenomenon

Albert Belle are two solid players
when it comes to building a
franchise. Belle batted .282 with
28 home runs and 95 RBIs in 123

' games. But he lost his cool and

was suspended for a week when
he threw a ball at a fan. Belle will
become an impact player
someday, but right now his talent
outweighs his brains. As for
Alomar, his brains outweigh his
talent. ‘The 25-year-old catcher
comes from a long line of baseball
thoroughbreds. From behind the
plate Alomar can offer a lot to the
Indians’ youthful pitching
rotation, but his rotator—cuff
surgery from a year ago has

dampened his ability to perform
with a bat. The pitching staff
includes ex-Cincinatti hurlers
Scott Scudder andJack Armstrong,
who were acquired in a trade for
Greg Swindell. But the best
offense in the league couldn’t
produce enough runs to account
for what this pitching staff will
give up. Expect Cleveland to finish
dead last and struggle to prevent
losing 100 games.

New York Yankees:

Well, the Yanks can expect
another year of George
Steinbrenner withdrawal, while
fans wonder if they’ll ever see
another winning team grace the
field of Yankee Stadium. The
free-agent acquisition of all—star
outfielder Danny. Tartabull
bolsters an already powerful
lineup of hitters, which includes
Matt Nokes, Kevin Maas, Don
Mattingly, Mel Hall and Roberto
Kelly. But, like the Indians, woeful
pitching will be their ultimate
downfall. Pascual Perez is
suspended this season for failing
another drug test. Without the
injury-plagued right-hander, the
Yankee starters have no chance
of improving on their combined
5.0_7 era from last year. But new
additions like Melido Perez,
Danny Tartabull, Mike Gallego
and Charlie Hayes just can’t
compensate for horrible pitching.
Unless they trade some dingers
for some deliverers, -the Yanks
will be clawing it out with
Cleveland for last place in the AL
East.

Baltimore Orioles:

The Orioles were last in pitching
in the AL last year, and their
hitting ranked 12th out of 14
teams. They finished the season
with a dismal 67-95 record, but

‘bullpen give

the O’s are on the rise. Oriole
Park at Camden Yards will open
this spring, and it will be the
most magnificent stadium ever
built, bar none! White Sox fans
will wince in envy when the
nation sees what a real field of
dreams looks like. It will.be hard
for the players to adjust to their
new home; they’ll need to learn
how to play the corners,/judge
the walls and get used to the
mounds. As for their talent, there’s
not much — just some inspiration
and a sell-out crowd to perform
in front of. MVP and Hall of Fame
shoe—in Cal Ripken Jr. can’t carry
the load, but if Glenn Davis shows
up this season with Storm Davis
and Rick Sutcliffe, the Orioles
can come close to .500. Ben
McDonald is a solid starter, and
Greg Olson’s 31 saves out of the
second—year
managerJohnny Oates a reliable
closer. Baltimore will be
respectable, but it’s still a few
years away from being a
contender. Baltimore will finish

fifth in the East but first in

ballparks.

Detroit Tigers:

Any team that has to rely on
Bill Gullickson, Walt Terrell and
dust—rag Frank Tanana to anchor
its pitching staff is in deep trouble.
Gullickson did finish the year
with a stellar 20-9 mark, but he’s

not Nolan Ryan. He allowed 30 .

more hits than innings pitched
while sporting an earned-run
average of 13.90. His record
indicates that the Tigers produced
runs when the soft right-hander
took the hill. They were the
exception to the rule that good
pitching is 75 percent of a winning
effort. The Tigers’ 209 home runs
were the most by any team in

both leagues, as five players dialed
“eight” 20 or more times. Detroit’s
tie for second place last year was
a mild surprise; then again, when
you’ve got Cecil Fielder in the
lineup, anything can happen. Milt
Cuyler is a stud in centerfield,
and veterans Lou Whitaker and
Alan Trammell make Detroit a
solid, defensive squad up the
middle. Detroit will finish fourth,
just ahead of Baltimore.

Milwaukee Brewers:

The story with the Brewers has
always been their inability to stay
healthy. Milwaukee finished last
season with a 40-19 run to finish
one game out of second place.
MVP for 1989 Robin Yount hurt
their chances by going on the
disabled list for 32 games. For the
past several seasons the Brewers
have been steadily improving,
and this year looks like Milwaukee
will finally get some recognition.
New manager Phil Garner has a
slew of offensive talent with
power hitter Greg Vaughn, Paul
Molitor, catcher B.J. Surhoff and
reliable Billy Spiers. The trade of
Gary Sheffield to the Padres for
Ricky Bones adds to an already
solid pitching staff led by Bill
Wegman, Chris Bosio, Jaimee
Navarro and the Brewers’
newfound closer, Doug Henry.
The Brewers have experience,
offense, pitching and a scrappy
new skipper in Garner. Not only
will they be a better than .500
team, but they’ll give the Red Sox
and Blue Jays a good run.

Toronto Blue Jays:

Baseball pundits say that this
year’s Toronto squad can’t miss.
Some preseason publications
have them in the World Series.
On paper, this team looks like it

 ed Sox to edge out Toronto tight East race

could beat the ’61 Yankees, the
’75 Reds and the ’79 Pirates. But
the game is not played on paper.
When it comes to pitching, Todd
Stottlemyre and David Wells are
the only legitimate starters. Juan
Guzman’s 10-3 record last. year
was a farce. His record in the
minor leagues was sub-.500, and
his ERA was above 4.00. Guzman
will have to prove that he can
play on the major—league level.
Jack Morris will be 37 in May. His
18-12 mark was impressive, but
it’s not likely that he'll perform
that way again. The Jays have just
one good defensive player in
Devon White. He had just one
error in 448 chances. As for the
rest of the team, it turned a season-
low 115 double plays, and its
.980 ﬁelding percentage ranked
11th in the AL. The Blue Jays will

‘win 85 games, but that will be

one or two shy of what it will take
to win the division. They’re great
on paper, slightly above average
otherwise. Give Toronto second
place; it’s just not their year.

Boston Red Sox:

Will Frank Viola make the
difference in Boston this year? No
question! The only thing that has
held the Sox back from a pennant
the last few years has been the
lack of a solid starter to
compliment Cy Young award-

winner Roger Clemens. Houston ’

transplant Danny Darwin, who
could come out of the closet to
win 15 games, and legendary

stopper Jeff Reardon make

Boston’s rotation almost elite

among AL East teams. Thi~_r,d.

baseman Carlos Quintana provide

Pens

Continued from page 7
the contest having surrendered
93 fewer goals than Pittsburgh,
but the stingy Pens played a type
of game reminiscent of, well, the
Habs.

The Pens’ penalty killing —
87.5 percent efficiency rating over
the last 40 chances — was strong
in the first period, killing off three
disadvantages including a major
stick infraction against Bob Errey.

It was Errey’s second stick-
related offense of the year and
carries an automatic one—game
suspension.

Keeping Montreal off the
scoreboard early was key to
Pittsburgh’s chances of victory.
The Habs had scored the first
goal of the game 54 times this
year and won a large percentage
of those games.

At one point, the Pens were
being out—shot 9~1, but goalie
Ken Wregget was only forced to
make two difficult saves — one
on a point—blank shot from rookie
phenom Gilbert Dionne and the
other a glove save on a blast from
Shayne Corson.

As in last year’s playoffs, the
Pens turned strong defense into

offense. Bryan Trottier turned a
giveaway by Russ Courtnall into
a shorthanded goal. He beat
Patrick Roy with a backhander
for his 11th goal of the year.

It was the Pens’ 15th
shorthanded goal of the season,
tying St. Louis and Detroit for the
league lead.

Pittsburgh was back at it less
than four minutes later when
Kevin Stevens took a cross-ice
pass from Rick T occhet, and after
a convenient bounce, skated in
and fired a low shot from between
the circles. It was his 52nd goal of
the year, leaving him three behind
Detroit's Jimmy Carson for the
most goals in a season by an
American player. Stevens already
holds the record for most points
in a season by an American player.

The intensity picked up after
Stevens’ goal, but the score
remained the same until early in
the second when the Pens

pumped two quick goals by a -

shaky Roy.
How bad was Roy? If he had
stepped in front of a bus, it would

have gone through his legs -
provided there wasn’t a bus strike.

Troy Loney deflected in his
ninth goal of the year on a
deflection of a Grant Jennings
shot, and 29 seconds later Phil
Bourque slammed home the
rebound of a Kjell Samuelsson
shot. Samuelsson had taken a
nice drop-pass banked off the
boards from rookie Shawn
McEachern.

After getting beaten by those
two sharpshooters (...NOT), Roy
pulled himself and was replaced
by Andre Racicot. He proved to
be a very rude guest. He had the
nerve to keep the home team off
the scoreboard for five full
minutes before red-hot Tocchet
bunted a puck out of midair for
his 25th goal of the season.

The Canadiens did manage to
get on the board with two carbon-

copy goals sandwiched around

Tocchet’s. Both goals came on
harmless-looking point shots that
somehow found the back of the
net. One was credited to Brian
Skrudland and the other to
Matthieu Schneider.

The two teams traded goals in
the third period. Mario Lemieux
scored his 43rd of the season

after relentless work by T occhet_
and Stevens. The assist was .

Steven’s 68th of the year,
surpassing former Canadien Mats
Naslund for the most ever in a
season by a left—winger.

NOTES- The N.H.L. Player's
strike is set for March 30 at 12:00
p.m. The players are demanding
a new "collective bargaining
agreement with the owners which
would be less restrictive in terms
of free agency and player
movement. The timing of the
strike is short of impeccable for
your local professional hockey
team. The Pens are starting to jell
as a team now that the players
from the big trade have settled
into place. They are winning at a
cool .68] clip in their last 11
games. Before Saturday's playoff-
clinching victory, the big question
was, “Will Pittsburgh make the
playoffs?” And now, with the strike
looming, the even bigger question
is, “Will Pittsburgh have a chance
to defend their Cup?”
