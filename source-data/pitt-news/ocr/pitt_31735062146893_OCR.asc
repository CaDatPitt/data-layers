WHAT -rqNicH'1"s PARADE ,ivInANs   ‘

I

_ :As a ﬁtting climax to the week of preparation bydthe student
tidy for the annual Thanksgiving Day game with_Penn State t0II1f>1".
 “ ‘afternoon, a parade w-l_1ich,‘it is‘ preVdicted,‘wiVll surpass In slzgeh
j‘ dfspiritp any previous one,'will be held this evening through the
tracts of Oakland and the downtown district. To bring about one
1.1; dred per cent attendance, those in charge of the aifalr have
red 3;’,-reward to the school havingthe best .1'E$presentat1_0Ii-. ‘V _
V Desirous that their school shall lead, the marshals. of the various.
«chools have worked hard in order tobe‘ sure that‘-eV€rY;S'C11<1ent  i
 department will be in the line of march. We know that those
-V h'ar,ge of the School of Economics section -have laid plans 1101:!
«o ly to have every student marching, but also to have their VaV1um_n1
increase their representation. Dean A. B. Wright‘ of the ‘School of
Economics has promised that the faculty of his school will march.
"Likewise, the School of Dentistgy, the College and.other:schoolsV have
repared for theevent. ' . v V j »
": The parade before the Syracuse game proved to the residents
'0 iPittsburgh.that the students of this Universityhad the “good old
.soll.ege spirit.” It caused sporting writers who formerly haddo-
«claimed Pitt spirit to change‘ their opinions in that respect. But
toni_ght’sV» parade is of much greater signiﬁcance. It will be of a
‘‘ tionalcharacter. When the students march through‘ the down-
 istreets, there will be thousands of persons there, who have come
to Pittsburgh only for the Pitt-Penn State game. Pitt graduates,
State alumni, football authorities and sporting writers from all over
li ‘ country  liefamong these thousands. Coach ‘iRobert”3Zuppke
.V-ﬂlinois, Coach William Roper of Princeton and a idozcn‘ of the
nceton varsity squad, besides hundreds of other prominent per-
o 'aVV.gcs’Vwil1 be certain to witness this parade. V _ '
This fact should be borne in mind by every student since the
 ‘tression of Pitt spirit obtained’ by these pI'0m511611t Visitors W111
ep-end. almost entirely upon the size of the parade. If they are
mpressed, they will carry back this news to their respective schools
"d.1o.ca.li~ties. " _ ’ ' .  > ‘ _ .
O-ne=‘hVundred per cent attendance and one hundred -per cent
tliusiasm. will make these visitors expect great things 01: our stu-
 body at tomorrow’s game. Let’s demonstrate true University
6 alty tovthemi, both tonight in the parade and tomorrow at the

Dr. Shailer Mattews, of Chicago,
will speak next Monday afternoon at
the regular student“ Vespers service
held at 4:30 o’clock in the-_ First Bap-
tist Church ‘on Belleﬁeld Avenue. Dr.
Matthews is one of the most promi?-V

Vnent men in the religious world. 2 His‘

commentaries on the Bible and on the
life of Christhave brought him an
international. reputation. Among his
writings may be noted, “The Social
Gospel,” ~ “The 1 Gospel and Modern
Man,” “Messianic Hope in the New
Testament,” and “T-he‘,Making' of To-
morrow.” '7. ’ ‘ e

In commenting .on the Student Ves-
pers service, Dean T.hyrs~a‘ Amos has
said. “The Student Vespers Service
seems to me to come nearest to pro-
ducing that s_a.n'rie atmosphere enjoyed
by Y-ale under _Dr. Hadley. and Dr.
Angeli or by Harvard under Dr. El-A
liott aiid Dr; Ddwell. It resembles
more than anything else the sort of
religious exercises held by institu-
tions who have Vc”afnpus life.” Every
student who has ever attended the
Vesper service has expressed a simi-
lar appreciation. «

Plll HAlllll_lSllS, FINISH  
up IN NATlllNAl RUN

Pitt ﬁnished eighth and seven-
teenth in the National A. A. U. cross-
country run held over the Schenley
Park course last Saturday. Hays was
eighth and Corbett seventeenth in a
ﬁeld of 38 starters which included
many of the best cross-country run-
ners in the country.

The New York Athletic Club by
ﬁnishing in the third, ﬁfth, ninth,
eleventh, and twelfth places, won the
team trophy with 40 points. P. A. A.
was second with 57, Carnegie Tech
third with 77, Edgar Thomson Steel
A. A. fourth with 92, and Homestead
Steel ﬁfth with 163. Pitt only had two
men entered.

Earl Johnston, the national 5-mile"
and 10-mile champion, representing
Edagr Thomson Steel, was the indi-
vidual winner. Johnston led the race
the whole way. Ritola of the,.Finnish-
American A. C. stayed with him and
ﬁnished about 75 yards behind. These
two, however, were nearly a quarter-
mile ahead of the third man, Le.slie,
of the New York A. C. Behind Les-
lie, however, the runners were all
bunched and ﬁnished on each other’s
heels. Hays ran a strong race the
whole way and kept right up with
the leaders. Corbett also ran a pretty
race and had a lot of stuff .left at
the ﬁnish. ’

The week prior Hays had defeated
a field of the best harriers in Western
Pennsylvania at Jeannette. Corbett
was seventh in this race. Both won
handsome trophies. ‘ _ _

The order in which the runners
ﬁnished and their affiliations follow:

1--Johnson, Edgar ‘Thomson; 2-
Ritola. Finnish-American; 3--Leslie,
New York; 4—Kelley, Carnegie
Tech; 5—Brennen, New. York; 6-—
Caughey, P. A. A.; 7--Weigel, P. A.
A.; 8--Hays, Pitt; 9-—Penﬁeld, New
York; 10-—Organ, P. A. A.; 11——Cor-
netta, New York; 12-—Sel1ers, New
York; 13-Young, Edgar Thomson;

NEBRASKA PAPER l’llAlSlES
SPllllTSllANSlllP or Pm

Sportsmanship means something
that is tangible and satisfying in the
Smoky City; the Pittsburgh sports-
manship is the real. article. The ﬁne
conduct of Glenn Warner, the Pitt
coach, who visited the dressing room
of the Nebraska squad, following the
Panthers’ defeat, to congratulate the
Cornhuskers and their coach, was
mentioned in the Saturday night dis-
patches wired from P.ittsburgh by
the sports -editor of The Star, but
Pitt’s tribute to the Cornhuskers was
not conﬁned to the statement by the
Panthers’ coach. Pittsburgh’s football
writers, ' without exception, heaped
praises on the Cornhuskers, giving
Coach Dawson’s men full credit for
their trouncing of a team which prior
to its overthrow by Nebraska, had
been rated as a worthy contender
for national championship honors.
Scarcely a line suggestive of excuse‘

 

-or alibi was published ‘by the Sunday

morning Pittsburgh newspapers in
their accounts of the game.

ALUMNAE nussw

On Tuesday evening, November
29th, the Alumnae will have the use
of Trees Gym and the Swimming Pool.
If you don't care to -swim, some exer-
cise on the ﬂoor will do you good.
Here is a good chance for the old
Basketball Girls to work up a team.
If basketball is too strenuous, then
join the Bathing Beau-ties who go in
for. a little snappy exercise before
they swim. You know you need exer-
cise. We are doing our best to let you
be fair to your physical self. Now do
your part! There are Pitt Girls in
every corner of this city. Be neigh-
borly and arrange to meet them near
home to come up to the Gym that
night. ' -

At an open forum meeting of the
Congress of Clubs and the Forum Club
held in the Hotel Chatham on last
Wednesday, Dorothy Paulin, our

chairman, preceded Chancellor Bow- -

man with a talk on the “(Sommunity
Chest” Plan. Dorothy would like very
much to see the plan put in effect in
Pittsburgh and vicinity. The name
explains the plan, which would re-‘
sult in co-operation among welfare
agencies. Thee fact that Dorothy -is
for it leads the rest of us to say it
is a good thing, and we hope she is
successful. Dorothy is secretary of the
Social Workers’ Club of Pittsburgh.

you that California is not the West,
but the country beyond the West!);

ment of Kauf-mann-Baer; Grace Gil-

HAT’S OUR IDEA in making CAMELS—the
Quality 1 Cigarette. ' 1 

Why, just buy Camels and look at the package! It’s
the best packing science has devised to keep cigarettes
fresh and full ﬂavored for your taste. Heavy paper out-
side-—secure foil wrapping inside’ and the revenue stamp
over the end to seal the package and keep it air—tight.

And note this! There’s nothing ﬂashy about the Camel
package.- N 0 extra wrappings that do not improve the
smoke. Not a cent of needless expense that must come
out of the quality of the tobacco. ‘

Camels wonderful and exclusive Quality wins on- merit
alone.

Because, men smoke Camels who want the taste and
fragrance of the finest tobaccos, expertly blended. Men
smoke‘ Camels for Camels smooth, refreshing mildness
and‘ their freedom from cigarettylaftertaste.

Camels are.made for men who think for themselves.
