Students prepare to go abroad

By Teresa Candori
Staff Writer

Although still a few weeks from ac-
tual departure time, last Saturday
marked the beginning of 13 intercon-
tinental sojoums for Pitt’s 1986 Sum-
mer Study Abroad Scholarship
Awardees.

V Saturday was Orientation Day for the

three graduate students and 10
undergraduates who were awarded
scholarships to study this summer in
universities all over the world.

The highlight of the day’s events was
a panel discussion with international
students studying at Pitt.

“The thing that really got them ex-
cited was politics, and the fact that
Americans don’t seem to be interested
in politics,” said Maxine Bruhns,
director of the program. “Those sorts
of insights help our students to realize
that they’d better learn something about
American politics, because they’re go-

ing to be asked about it.”

Laurie Burke, a junior psychology
major who will be studying in Germany
this summer, said that the panel discus‘-
sion was the most valuable part of the
orientation. “I learned a lot about Ger-
many that I could never have learned
from a book,” she said. Burke is the
winner of the Helen Pool Rush Award
which is presented every year to a
female undergraduate and has for the
past three years been used for study in
Germany.

Another important aspect of the
orientation session is a discussion with
last year’s scholarship recipients who
offer the perspective of American
students in a new environment.

“It’s something I wish I’d had the
first time I was abroad,” said Robert
Sette, a sophomore Spanish and French
major bound for Spain. “For example,
one panelist told of her roommate who
wore something inappropriate in the
Orthodox section of Jerusalem and
created a bit of a scene.”

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

The “something inappropriate” was
a short-sleeved blouse, and the incident
illustrated the variety of customs the
students may be called upon to deal
with. Sette is the recipient of the Na-
tionality Council Scholarship, and will
be studying linguistics and phonetics at
the University of Barcelona.

Besides givingstudents a chance to
experience a totally new culture and en-
vironment, the scholarship program
also offers the opportunity for students
to dig deeper into a culture in which
they have already had some experi-
ence. Such is the case for Julie Beley,
a sophomore anthropology major.

“I wanted to do a project in cultural

anthropology this summer, and I -
thought Thailand would be the best

place because I had been there for one
year as a high school exchange stu-
dent,” said Beley. “So, I already had
a familiarity with the country and
language.” She was awarded the Vera
Heinz Award and will be studying in
Lampang, Thailand.

More than 700 students were forced to evacuate Tower B last night after a fire in the building’s gar-
bage chute sent smoke billowing to the top floors and filling them with smoke. The cause of the fire
is unknown but is not believed to have been intentional, according to police.

Chevron turns over research facility

Chevron Corp. has formally
transferred title of the former Gulf
Research Center in Harmarville, Pa.,
to the University of Pittsburgh.

The 54-building, 85—acre facility,
one of the largest and most sophis-
ticated industrial research and develop-
ment facilities in the United States, has
been renamed the University of Pitts-
burgh Applied Research Center.

A ceremony announcing the transfer
was held at the center today. Repre-
senting Chevron was James Lee, vice
chairman of Chevron and former chair-
man of Gulf Oil Corp. Pitt President
Wesley Posvar formally accepted
Chevron’s gift of the center of behalf
of the university. State, county and
local government officials also
attended.

In addition to donating the center to
Pitt, Chevron is providing the univer-
sity with $3 million over three years
to help finance start-up operations. The
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has
also made a $1 million Department of
Commerce economic development
grant to help defray start-up costs, and
Governor Dick Thornburgh has‘ in-
cluded an additional $2 million in his
ﬁscal year ’87 budget for the same
purpose. ’

Posvar expressed the university’s
gratitude to Chevron for the gift, point-
ing out that the center will not only
beneﬁt the university but “is really a
gift to the people of Pennsylvania and
the Pittsburgh region. The center will

ultimately serve as an operational

resource to beneﬁt education, business

> and industry and the general public as

well.

“We expect the center to stimulate
the economic revitalization of the Pitts-
burgh region and become a national
asset for the advancement of American
science and technology.”

Gulf Oil Corp. previously operated
the center, which is located 14 miles
northeast of downtown Pittsburgh, for
almost 50 years. Much of the state-of-
the-art technology that Gulf pioneered
in the oil industry was developed at the
center.

U-PARC_ will now be operated by

‘Pittsburgh Applied Research Corp. , a

subsidiary of the University of Pitts-
burgh Trust, and will be used by the

WEDNESDAY, MARCH 19, 1986

As a result of a recent hazing

- report, the university administra

tion has suspended all Alpha Kappa.

Alpha sorority functions and pledge

activities pending a hearing which

has been set for tomorrow at 5:30
p.m..

The hearing date was set by the
sorority and Student Activities
Director Andrew Smith at a pre-
liminary meeting this past Monday.
' According to Smith, Monday’s
meeting was held “to insure that
they [the sorority members] under-
stand the charges against them.”
Smith would not disclose any fur-
ther details about the case.

The university began investigat-
ing the sorority after receiving a
complaint last Thursday by Fonda
Duse, a freshman from Wilkins-
burg who was pledging the sorori-
ty. Sources said Duse walked into
Smith’s office on crutches.

Duse claimed that her knee,
which has been ailing her since she
injured it in high school, was re-
injured as a result of alleged haz-
ing activities. “Now I have to start
therapy all over again,” she said.

Duse would not discuss any de-
tails about the alleged hazing, but

Hearing date set for
hazing allegations

she did say there were several
incidences. ‘

Duse also expressed her dismay
about comments made in The Pitt
News last Monday by Phyllis
Valentine, the sorority’s graduate
advisor. Valentine stated that she
thought Duse was just a “problem
person” and that the whole situa-
tion was merely a personal
problem.

“I’m not a problem person, my
boss doesn’t think I’m a problem
person, and my friends don’t think
I’m a problem person,” Duse said ~
in response to Valentine’s
statements.

Duse said that she may have been
perceived as a problem person
because she does not approve of
everything the sorority does and
what they make pledges do. She
said the sorority makes her do
things which are humiliating to her.

“If it’s going to belittle my
womanhood, then I refuse to go

along with it,”.. she. said.   

Duse said that she was reluctant
at first to report the alleged hazing
because, she really wanted to be-
come a sorority sister. “I wanted
to be a part of the sorority so bad
that I didn’t even want to tell my
mother about what happened.”

Valentine could not be reached

for comment.

Divestment rally set;
Brutus to lead protest

By Michael Ashford
Special Projects Editor

On Friday, March 21, 26 years ago,
“Sharpeville”~ became a word
synonymous with oppression and
resistance in South Africa. South
African police opened ﬁre on an un-
suspecting crowd of blacks who were
protesting the law which requires them
to carry ofﬁcial passes at all times.

The police, according to one official,
“lost their heads,’ ’ and 69 people were
shot to death, 52 of them in the back.

In memory of Sharpeville, concerned
students and city residents will march
in the call for divestment this Friday
afternoon. The march will begin at 11
a.m. in front of the Cathedral of
Learning.

Sharpeville is one of several so-
called townships in South Africa where
blacks, under the racial segregation of
apartheid, are forced to live. Some 3.5
million blacks have been coercively
removed from other areas to live in
such townships since 1960. From
there, black workers are bused back
and forth into the cities where they
work for whites.

The rally on Friday will be led by
Dennis Brutus, a native South African

and outspoken critic" of the South

African government. Brutus will
become the chairman of Pitt’s black
studies department in September of this
year.

Brutus has gained international
recognition for his poetry, which he

says is shaped by his experiences in .

South Africa. In his home country,
Brutus was twice imprisoned for his
anti-apartheid activity and shot once for
trying to escape.

“The South African prisons gave
birth to my poetry,” Brutus said earlier
this semester at Pitt. "Prison allowed
me to think about my poetry.”

Brutus will be reading, with several

other poets, tomorrow night at 8 p.m. i

in the Kurtzman Room of the William
Pitt Union in commemoration of the
Sharpeville massacre. In reference to
his future position as chairman of black
studies, Brutus said, “I am going to stir
up a whole lot of trouble when I get
here.”

The Sharpeville incident led to a
governmental ban of the African Na-
tional Congress and the Pan-Africanist
Congress, which had been working
within South Africa to organize

resistance to apartheid’s system of laws .

and constraints. The arrest of ANC
leader Nelson Mandela soon followed.

Mandela, still in prison today, has
become a symbol of black resistance
for the current government.

The government crackdown after
Sharpeville effectively squelched
signiﬁcant protest until fairly recently.
In 1976, the movement was revived by
striking black school students in the
township of Soweto. _

' Since the initial protests over ine-
qualities in education began that year,
more than 1,000 blacks have been
killed in clashes with police and in in-
temecine conﬂicts with other blacks.

MOSCOW — Officials at the U.S.
Embassy in Moscow confirmed that the
Soviet Union has officially protested
what it called a “provocative” incident
in the Black Sea separating Turkey
from the U.S.S.R. The protest said two
U.S. Navy warships traveled six miles
inside Soviet territorial waters and
stayed there for two hours.

Aquino may get
emergency powers

MANILA, Philippines -—- The
Philippine political affairs minister said
a government panel has set aside a plan
to declare a revolutionary government.
Antonio Cuenco said the panel instead
recommended convening the National
Assembly in May to enact a law grant-
ing President Corazon Aquino emer-
gency powers to bring about reforms.
Aquino today formed a seven-member
committee on human rights headed by
a respected former senator jailed in the
rule of ousted President Marcos.

NASA searches
for more wreckage

it began, secretly. The bad weather that
had hampered the operation last week
appeared to have changed to ideal as
Navy divers resumed the search for re-
mains of the crew and vital wreckage
on the ocean floor. Thus far, the
salvagers have brought up tons of
wreckage from the ship‘s main engines
and more debris from its shattered crew
cabin.

The remains of the crew, however,
are already on shore undergoing
analysis by government pathologists for
identification. NASA has said it will
not discuss the remains until all iden-
tifications are complete. Sources said
that could be a lengthy process.

Afghanistan — A United Nations
mediator said the Afghan government
has come up with a draft proposal for
withdrawing Soviet troops from
Afghanistan. He called it “a good basis
for discussions.” The mediator has
shuttled between Kabul and Islamabad,
the capital of Pakistan, for the past 12
days. He said he expects the United
Nations will announce the resumption
of peace negotiations in Geneva be-
tween Afghanistan and the Soviet
Union.

WASHINGTON — A House
Foreign Affairs subcommittee voted to
subpoena documents seized from
ousted Philippine President Ferdinand
Marcos. The documents may detail his
financial holdings. Subcommittee
Chairman Stephen Solarez said
customs officials agreed to turn over
copies of the 2,300 pages of papers
later today to his Asian and Pacific Af-
fairs subcommittee. The panel also
voted to subpoena four people, at least
two of them Americans, believed to
have negotiated the sale and purchase
for Marcos of property in New York
City.

Joint agreement
over acid rain

WASHINGTON — Canadian Presi-

dent Brian Mulroney and President‘

Reagan have reached common ground
on the thorny issue of acid rain. A
senior administration ofﬁcial refused to
give details of the pact, but the agree-
ment is scheduled to be unveiled tomor-
row as Reagan and Mulroney wind up
their talks at the White House. Other

U.S. officials said Reagan will embrace
parts of a joint U.S.-Canadian study
recommending a $5 billion program to
test ways of curbing acid rain.

Quake cause
under investigation

ATHENS, Ohio -— The earthquake
that jolted much of the Eastern United
States on J an. 31 may have been caused
by high—pressure injection wells near
the Perry Nuclear Power Plant in Ohio.
An Ohio University professor said the
quake, which registered five on the
Richter scale, was felt from Chicago
to Washington, D.C. and caused some
minor damage near the epicenter,
which was about 30 miles northeast of
Cleveland. The epicenter was about
seven miles south of hazardous waste
injection wells operated by Calhio
Company, an agricultural chemical
producer.

The Perry Nuclear Power Plant,
which received a low—power license
from the Nuclear Regulatory Commis-
sion last week, is about three miles
north of the wells. Moid Ahmad, chair-
man of Ohio University’s geology
department, said there is an active
fault, and by injecting the ﬂuid they
lubricated the fault and caused the
earthquake. He said that one of his

in 1982 and found the pressure was 300
times the normal atmospheric pressure
of 15 pounds per square inch.

university as an advanced applied
research and development center.
Henry A. LaRue. former president of
Gulf Research and Development Co.,
has been named the corporation’s
president.

U—PARC will support several types
of activities that are designed to pro-
duce income and generate new in-
dustri_es and new jobs while advancing
applications of science. These include:
incubator services and facilities to help
small start-up companies launch ad-
vanced technology ventures; corporate
research for established companies
needing additional or supplemental
research facilities; contract research in

GM signs
contract
with center

The AC Spark Plug Division of
General Motors Corp. has signed a
four—year, $13 million contract with the
University of Pittsburgh to conduct
sophisticated catalyst durability tests of
automobile and truck gasoline engines.

The testing will be done at the former
Gulf Research Center in Harmarville,
Pa., now the University of Pittsburgh
Applied Research Center. I

With the signing of the engine—testing
contract, GM becomes the largest
client at U—PARC. Eleven small start-
up ﬁrms earlier leased space and facil-
ities at the center to do research, con-
duct development and provide technical
and support services.

Under terms of the Pitt—GM contract,

the engine—testing work will be per-

formed by Pittsburgh Applied Research
Corp., a subsidiary of the University
of Pittsburgh Trust and operator of the
U—PARC facility.

GM’s AC Spark Plug Division,
which supplies more catalytic con-
verters to the automobile industry than
any other manufacturer, is having the
tests conducted in an effort to improve
the life and quality of its catalytic con-
verters. The testing project will occupy
13 of the 20 fully equipped engine test
cells Gulf installed and operated for
fuel—assessment programs over many
years.

Thirty additional test cells will be in-
stalled in a new testing building to ac-
commodate the GM program, which is
larger than the program Gulf had con-
ducted at the site.

Thirty unemployed professional and
technical people who had worked on
Gulf engine—testing programs at Har-
marville are being hired at U—PARC to
initiate the GM program.

The commitment and capabilities of
these people were a major factor in
GM’s decision to accept Pitt’s proposal
for the testing contract, according to
George White, the university’s vice
president for applied research.

“We were successful in bidding on
the contract because we were able to

, offer GM both outstanding facilities
and outstanding, experienced people to A

operate the program,” White said.
“We anticipate that additional technical
and support personnel will be hired for
the project as the testing continues.”

The testing program at U—PARC will
supplement GM programs in place at
AC Spark Plug Division world head-
quarters in Flint, Michigan. Among the
research activities to be carried out at
the center are precious metal loading
and ratio needs based on forward
engine programs, metal and ceramic
substrate analysis, catalyst poisoning
studies for both monolith and pellet
substrate converters and comparisons

of existing and proposed catalyst for— .

mations vendors

supplied by

such areas as coal, biotechnology and
pharmaceuticals funded by government
or private sources; technology transfers
between university laboratories and
regional corporations in collaboration
with the university’s Foundation for
Applied Science and Technology; and
scientific collaboration involving con-
sortia of companies with common
technological interests which would
fund research in selected areas.

Pitt’s Center ’ for Hazardous
Materials Research will be located at
U-PARC, and the university is
establishing the Metals Casting Institute
which was founded by a charter and
gift of equipment from ARCO Metals
Corporation at the site. In addition,
Pitt’s Graduate School of Public
Health, which is under contract with
the Environmental Protection Agency
to determine residential permeation of
water supply toxicants, is doing
research at the center. ~

Already a dozen companies are leas-
ing space and facilities at U—PARC to
conduct research, do product testing
and development and provide technical
and support services. The largest, the
AC Spark Plug Division of General
Motors Corporation, just signed a four-
year, $13 million contract to conduct
sophisticated catalyst durability tests of
automobile and truck gasoline engines
at the center. The testing program will
be conducted by the Pittsburgh Applied
Research Corp.

In addition to GM, 11 small start—up
firms have leased space and facilities
at U—PARC. U-PARC’s initial tenants
will employ between 50 and 60 people
at their peak this year. These same
tenants will have between 180 and 200

employees on their payrolls by 1988,
according to forecasts. Additional
employees will be hired as new client-
tenants locate at the center and the
university officials project that employ-
ment at U—PARC could in five years
reach 2,000 -— the number employed
by Gulf at the peak of the company‘s
research activities there.

Chevron, Gulf Oil’s parent, last
April stated its preliminary intention to
donate the Harmarville center to Pitt
and the university’s board of trustees
approved the concept last September.
There followed a process to analyze the
site and ensure compliance with local,
state and federal regulations. A
thorough environmental assessment of
the site was made and submitted to the
Department of Environmental
Resources for review. The DER
review has been completed and
Chevron, the university and the in-
dependent consultants engaged by them
agree that the environmental re-
quirements have been met.

It has been estimated that it would
cost more than $100 million to replace
the center -— the land, building and
facilities — at today’s prices.

U.S. Rejects
- Test BanTreaty  

Perhaps the world’s brawniest, most fearsome bullies —- the
United States and the Soviet Union -— can never fully sweep aside
their covetous competitive differences and behave as chums. But
it is certainly not unreasonable to believe that these two antagonists
can cooperate to the extent that they could together address earnest-
ly a problem that plagues modern international politics and threatens
our world with apocalyptic mayhem. Nuclear weaponry and its
proliferation, the potential for paroxysmal catastrophe of which
may from time to time intrude upon the serenity of mind of even
the most chronically apathetic of individuals, clamors for a con-
certed, united effort to disarm.

For various reasons (some more obvious _than others), the in-
terests of both the United States and the Soviet Union are served
by bringing a halt to the arms race. Because the sluggish senses
of leaders on both sides have been sufﬁciently aroused to recognize
this, nascent efforts to achieve a truce of sorts and to regulate the
development of new nuclear weaponry have been witnessed. But
obstructive dragging of the feet has been clearly evident — especial-
ly of late — particularly on the part of the Reagan administration.

Mr. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union recently proposed a measure
that would mark genuine progress toward limiting the nuclear arms
race. Mr. Reagan and his staff were invited to join the Soviets in
negotiations for a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty — an of-
fer that Mr. Reagan promptly declined — and the Soviets declared
their own unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing, promising that
they would undertake no further nuclear tests, unless the United
States were to do so ﬁrst. «

Ostensibly, Mr. Reagan objects to this proposal because he
doubts the sincerity of Mr. Gorbachev and his cohorts, claiming
that their ploy is simply propaganda designed to preserve Soviet
nuclear superiority. The utterly dubious claim of a Soviet «lead in
the arms race (the U.S.S.R. might have a quantitative lead in the
number of land-based ICBMs, but the technological/qualitative

edge clearly belongs to the United States) exposes this argument _

as demonstrably deceptive.

Mr. Reagan’s true motive for decrying the Soviet proposal is
to be discovered in the fact that continued nuclear testing will be
necessary to further progress in the highly touted Star Wars pro-
gram. Thus has Mr. Reagan’s obsessive and deluded faith in
superior military might as a keeper of the peace so clouded his
reason that he has spurned the first real opportunity for progress
in the nuclear arms talks and displayed his contempt for the peace-
making process.

The manic fear of continuously living under the proverbial

- ominous cloud of nuclear doom has apparently not impressed the

president. He falsely and dangerously perceives military build-up
as a panacea for the ills that afﬂict our nation. Unless Mr. Reagan
is soon unburdened of this mistaken notion, the little progress that
has heretofore been made to lessen the smoldering hostilities be-
tween the United States and the U.S.S.R. might abruptly and
portentously come to an end.

Racist Paranoia

I am writing in response to the
editorial “Police Harrassment” (The
Pitt News, March 10). Aisha Rice is
so paranoid about racism that she
would turn any unrelated incident into
racism or apartheid. I am employed in
Forbes Quadrangle and as a result, I
often stay there late to study. On two
occasions I have been harassed, not by
the Campus Police but by a suspicious
person. Upon reporting this to the
Campus Police, I received immediate
attention (within two or three minutes)
for which I was very relieved. I feel
much safer knowing that the Campus
Police will investigate reports of
suspicious people. That, in fact, was
what they were doing when they ques-
tioned Aisha Rice and her boyfriend,
Tita Lucas.

The Campus Police received a report

. about a suspicious person in Hillman

Library who was not “hurting” peo-
ple as Ms. Rice stated but publicly
fondling his genitals. Tita Lucas
matched the description of the mastur-
bating individual. When the Campus
Police spotted him leaving with Ms.
Rice,,they approached them. They ap-
proached Ms. Rice and Mr. Lucas not
because they were black, but because
Mr. Lucas fit the description of the
“suspicious” man. They were looking
out for the safety of Ms. Rice, and the
only reason they asked for identifica-
tion was to get an oppurtunity to be
sure Ms. Rice was leaving with Mr.
Lucas of her own free will. Noting her
name and social security number was
not a demonstration of apartheid in
America but was merely standard pro-
cedure in case the information was
needed at a later time — in the event

of a missing persons report, for ,

example.

It is ridiculous to compare the situa-
tion of the blacks in South America to
the blacks in “racist America, ” as
American blacks are by far better off.
It is even more ridiculous to bring apar-
theid into an issue that had nothing to
do with race except that the suspicious
person was described as a black man,
except of course, if one happened to
have worries about racism that ap-
proach paranoia.

Performers

I could not help but laugh at the
bleeding—heart editorial you published
about the drug problem in baseball (The
Pitt News, March 7).

You complain that Mr. Ueberroth’s
response (suspension or tines) has un-

fortunately sent a “fearful message”
to baseball’s drug addicts that will lead
to punishment and public embarass-
ment for users. Believe it or not, that
is exactly the message he wanted to
send. Drugs have no place in baseball,
and the commissioner wants the game
cleaned up.

Regarding two other points in your

editorial: ' ‘

_ 1. You state that “the curse” of drug
addiction is a disease and that drug
users are victims, not criminals. This
was a surprise to me and probably to
the officers of the Pittsburgh legal
system as well. Unless cocaine and the
other drugs used by ballplayers have
been legalized within the past half-
hour, their use is a crime punishable
by fines and prison terms!

2. As for your claim that these ‘ ‘vic-
tims’ ’ should be given every opportuni-
ty for rehabilitation, I say that they are
already getting preferential treatment.
If you or I were to be caught using
drugs at work, we would be ﬁred on
the spot; baseball players are given the
choice of a suspension or a fine that is
small when put in the context of their
salaries (ﬁning a $1-million-a-year
ballplayer $100,000 still leaves him
$900,000 to live on — hardly pauper’s
wages). If the police caught us buying
or selling drugs, we would wind up
with prison records; baseball players
get immunity from prosecution.

Instead of sending out the fearful
message you describe, society and the
baseball commissioner have sent base-
ball players a very different one: If you
use drugs, you won’t go to jail and you
won’t be banned for life from the sport.
Instead you will receive a slap on the
wrist before you go back to earning
multimillion dollar contracts.

Does this sound like harsh punish-
ment? I think not!

Engineers Shafted

The Wednesday, March 5 issue of
The Pitt News greeted us with a front-
page article highlighting the upcoming
activities of Greek Week. In last Mon-
day’s (March 10) issue, a photograph
appears on page nine showing a frater-
nity member soliciting funds from a
motorist. Two days later, the front page
featured a photo of a chariot race team
and on page three appeared a quarter-
page picture of a fraternity member
donating blood. Finally, on Friday, the
front page proffers a group of Greeks
wolﬁng down roast beef sandwiches at
Greek Gorge.

— It’s not too hard to guess that last
week was Greek Week.

Last week was another sort of week,
too. Continuing a 32-year-old tradition,

 

the students of the engineering school
sponsored Engineer’s Week: eight ma-
jor events, including a blood drive, a
parade and an outdoor competition on
the Cathedral lawn.

Where were the pictures? Where was
even a single mention of this activity
(outside of paid advertising)? A men-
tion is ﬁnally made in the Monday,
March 17 issue: a full eighth of a page
write-up on page six. The opening line
tells us (concerning E-Week): “ ...the
Pitt _campus was ﬁlled with high-
spiritedness and special events.’ ’ Gee,
sounds suspiciously like news, doesn't
it?

Greek Week is a substantive and
valuable undertaking with an excellent
goal — the raising of money for chari-
ty. The Greeks work hard and .deserve
recognition for their efforts, and, in
fact, it is hightly gratifying to see that
they received the aforementioned news
coverage.

But come on editors, the engineering
students worked hard, too. A parochial
event, you say, with limited interest?
Sorry, but there are about 1,000 more
undergraduate engineering students
than there are Pitt Greeks, including
both fraternity and sorority member-
ship. (Perhaps the percentage of Greeks
on The Pitt News staff is a bit higher
than the norm.) No human interest
angle? Wrong again: The Engineer’s
Week blood drive brought in 266 pints.
Not interesting? Honestly, what do you

think the engineering students compete ‘

with — calculators? No, they set up
decorated gaming rooms, dressed up in
costumes, danced, sang, performed
skits, ran a soapbox derby, took on an
obstacle course and battled in a tug of
war, to name a few things.

It was your loss (and that of your
readers) not to have published a pic-
ture of the parade performances — in-
cluding one act featuring over 60 peo-
ple performing a colorful choreo-
graphed dance routine to Tommy
James’s “Mony Mony.”

Congratulations to the Greeks on a
job well done.

No thanks to The Pitt News, for your
journalistic myopia.

Strategies Of Penetfation

As I wrote last week when discussing
the herd, a masturbatory culture is utterly
averse to the penetration of possibility
(sounds grand, don’t it). The more ab-
stract corollary to the herd is routine,
otherwise known as quotidian complacen-
cy. Now don’t get me wrong, I believe
in routine as much as the next over-
achiever, but when taken to extremes, as
so many people do, routine creates a stale
and jellified mind or mindset. If you
agree with this assessment and are not a
hardline Christian (or some moralistic
variation), inhibited, squeamish or a com-
munist, (their version of subversion

usually follows a strict party line) then '

I have some suggestions as to how you
can penetrate, rankle, mock and basically
pee on the hardened artery of the condi-
tioned response. Most of these sugges-
tions, several of which I have tried, are
characterized by a distinctly absurdist or
Dadaist bent (some might say nihilistic,
but I’m not one of those and would never
instruct anyone in such a stagnant, life-
denying mindset) with personal amuse-
ment as an overriding priority. Act,
gawk, harumph or just laugh, but keep

in mind that the world of the babbit, the

dogmatist, the dead—seri0us moralist or
ideologue, the 9-5 robot, etc. is fertile
ground for amusement and cheap thrills.
Here goes, hold on to your slide rules.

— Go to a film like “Rambo” or some ‘

such popular, reactionary piece of dogma
doo (“Red Dawn,” “Delta Force,” etc.)
with 10 people or so all dressed in Ram-
bo T-shirts, headbands, combat boots and
fatigues and brandish plastic machine
guns (compact Uzis are best), big rub-
ber knives and, if possible, toy model
rocket-propelled grenade launchers. Sit
separately (or together if you wish to
emulate conventional warfare) and
scream maniacally whenever Rambo or
the chosen icon scores a hit. Randomly
yell (or chant) things like “death to
gooks,” “never again, never again” or
“USA, USA, USA.” Or go to slash ﬁlms
like “Friday the 13th” in death masks
and fake blood. Squeal and scream when-
ever the blood hits the fan.

— Go to see a Top 40 hand with 5-10
people, all wearing glasses of some sort,
gone, boss shades are the best, and
whenever the guitarist takes a clone solo,

rush the stage en masse, take your glasses
off and stare wide-eyed right at his hands
as if in total, like awe of his technical
brilliance. Always scream for “Free-
bird," “Stairway to Heaven" and
whatever's No. l that day. Chances are
they’ll play it, too. »

— A variation of the above would take
place while a formula blues or r&b band
is playing (the Decade is the best and
most convenient spot for this). Every 10
seconds or so yell, “rock it, daddy.”

. “ohhhhhhhh man,” “eeeeeeowwwww”

or “play it, brother." Whenever the sax-
ophonist or harmonicist takes a solo
scream as shrilly and continuously as
possible, “blow man blow.” The blob
at the door probably won’t appreciate
your antics, but you don’t go to bars to
please the bouncers do you?

— Go to Micky Us or any other fast
food cancer haven and order hot cheese
enemas, deep fried dung and/or a- scabies
shake. If they tell you they don’t have any
of these delicacies (chances are they will
tell you such) say incredulously, “But I
just had that same meal here yesterday.’ ’

— If you find a dead animal, (big rats

are the best) pick it up with two sticks
and walk down the street (the more
crowded the better) spastically, giggling
in a like manner, point at the rat and wave
it in front of people and at cars stopped
at lights. If the police see you, hide the
rat immediately (they’ll never see it down
your pants) and if they stop you, throw
the dead beast aside and act exaggeratedly
sane - “Yes, sir officer, no, sir officer.”

— If you happen to catch an atrocious
comedian, (Grafﬁti is good for this) laugh
hysterically at the worst, silence-
provoking jokes. This is quite construc-
tive as it gives the struggling hack good
practice with hecklers.

— If a wrong number calls, say, “Yeah
he/she’s naked, bound and ready for
pleasure.” '

-— Go to parties or places like the
Upstage in outrageous digs like a psych-
edelic Good Will pimp cast-off shirt with
plaid pants tucked into cowboy boots, a
bright bandana or some equally foul, out
of place headgear, gaudy, large eyewear
and large goofy simulated earrings like
air freshener on a string or rubber models
of wrestlers. (I favor the Iron Sheik.) A

light-up beer sign necklace is ideal. Sit
in a corner, plug it in and watch them‘
watch. By dressing so outrageously you
can parody vulgarity while you set new
fashion trends. If you go back the next
week, you might see someone wearing
a replica of your outfit.

— Violently destroy all broken or
useless small appliances, preferably
against a concrete wall. Also, break
wooden furniture (chairs are best) from
people’s trash on the street. Furniture used
to reserve parking spotsin the winter is

a particularly prime target. It's great _

release and a creative use for refuse.
— Tell people things they don’t want
to hear. ,
Childish? Pointless? Foolish? Sure, but
why not? The possibilites are endless as

_ is the degree to which you can go. Look

at James I.-Iuberty who slaughtered 21
people with submachine guns at a
California McDonald’s or the young
woman who killed and maimed school
children because, as the song says, she
just 'didn’t like Mondays. Talk about
manic Mondays. Talk about a break in
the monotony. I

Not In Kansas Anymore/Kevin Bold

The Pros AndC-olns Of Ayn Rand

Recently a friend asked ‘me ifl had read
a letter to the editor about my “Why I
Like Social Darwinism” column. I said
that I hadn’t; most responses to my
writing are so illogical that reading them
could lead me toaccept the “anyone who
disagrees with me is a jerk” fallacy.
“You ought to read this one,” he said.

I’m glad I did. The writer called my
column “inspiring” and asked an honest
question: What did I like and dislike
about the philosophy of Ayn Rand? To
show my appreciation, I’ll answer it.

I became familiar with Ayn Rand’s
“objectivist” philosophy in 1983. I liked
most of it because I already held similar
notions: belief in individualism, reason,
laissez—faire capitalism and minimal

government. Ayn Rand, however, was
not the only exponent of these views. I
had already read Robert Heinlein, Milton
Friedman and F.A. Hayek. Nor was she
the best; anyone who compares “Atlas
Shrugged” with Heinlein’s “The Moon
is a Harsh Mistress” or hervessays on
government with Robert Nozick’s
“Anarchy, State and Utopia” will see
what I mean.

One of my beefs with Ayn Rand is her
contempt for most of her sources. She
owes a huge debt to American liber-
tarianism, British utilitarianism and —— of
all things! — Russian anarchism. Yet she
acknowledged debt to no one but Aristot-
le. Despite objectivism’s libertarian
roots, many objectivist publications speak

of libertarianism only in disparaging
terms.

Another is her encouragement of a cult
following. Her devotees have practical-
ly canonized her (an odd behavior for
atheists!) and many of them are ignorant
of other libertarian authors. (I know of

, a man who wrote a letter to a college

newspaper in which he used some classic
libertarian arguments to criticize the
welfare state. Some “objectivists” thanked
him for it by accusing him of plagiariz-
ing what they thought were Ayn Rand’s
unique ideas! Despite knowing the man
personally -— one of them sat next to him
in one of his classes at the time — they
made no attempt to get the whole story
before slandering him and offered no

apology when the truth came out.)
The objectivist philosophy is not, as the
letter writer stated, “based purely on
reason.” While it has some interesting v
arguments, it also misrepresents other
viewpoints and contains circular think-
ing. Objectivism is also hostile to science:
Ayn Rand couldn’t handle Heisenberg’s
indeterminacy principle or Godel’s in-
completeness theorem. (It demolished her
“logic proves logic” doctrine.) Further-
more, Ayn Rand seemed to think that
anyone who was an altruist was also a
mystic, a statist and a collectivist. This
is simply not true. Aleister Crowley,
Mikhail Bakunin and V.I. Lenin prove,
in various combinations, that a person can
subscribe to one of these philosophies

without necessarily embracing the others.

Ayn Rand has introduced libertarian
ideas to many, and for that I am grateful.
But knowing what I know about her, her
philosophy and the way her followers
behave, I cannot speak of her in the glow-
ing terms some would prefer me to use.

I refer interested readers to William F.
O’Neill’s “With Charity Towards None:
An Analysis of Ayn Rand’s Philosophy”
and Jerome Tucille’s “It Usually Begins
with Ayn Rand. ” I also recommend Lud-
wig von Mises’ “Human Action,” F.A.
Hayek’s “The Road to Serfdom” and
Robert Nozick’s “Anarchy, State and

Utopia.” These authors present liber- .

tarian ideas with greater depth and clari-

' ty than Ayn Rand ever did.

Nurse examines birth control

By Michelle Zollner
Staff Writer

Anne was 18 and Jim was 24. They
had been going out for. seven months
and saw each other every day. They
were very open and soon began talk-
ing about making love because, in their
relationship, they felt that making love
would be a natural progression. How-
ever, as with many people, Anne and
Jim had to face their own apprehen-
sions about sex and birth control.

With the increased sexual activity in
society, birth control has become an
issue increasing in importance. In a
study done on the 18- to 21-year-old
age group in 1960, approximately 50
percent of the people polled were sex-
ually active, according to Jan Devoe,
nurse educator of the Student Health
Service. The same study was conducted
in the 1970s, and was found that the
percentage had increased to 75 percent.

“When choosing a form of birth con-
trol,” said Devoe, “the first thought
should be how medically safe it is, and
then such considerations as lifestyle and
partner preference.”

Anne and Jim used the method of
withdrawal the first few months be-
cause of Anne’s religious beliefs.
However, “this method has a high
failure rate,” Devoe said, “although
withdrawal is probably used the most
in the college years.”

Anne, after realizing she was taking
a risk with the method she and Jim
were using, decided to use a safer form
of birth control. “I had to face the
realization that I had to balance my
religious beliefs with my own personal
life.” said Anne. “Although there are
several methods of birth control on the

market, the Pill, I found, was best for
me."

The most effective method of birth
control, according to Devoe, is the Pill.
“This is especially true for college
students who are healthy and non-
smokers.”

The Pill's greatest advantage is that
it is easy to use. One pill is taken daily
at the same time of the day. However,
for the first month on the Pill, Devoe
recommends that another form of birth
control also be used for protection. She
added that the main disadvantage of the
Pill is that it has been known to cause
side effects.

“After the Pill, the second safest
form of birth control is foam and a con-
dom,” said Devoe. She highly recom-
mends the use of a condom no matter
what other form of birth control is used.
“The importance of a condom in-
creases with multiple partners,” said
Devoe, “because a condom prevents
the spreading of sexual diseases.” The
disadvantages of this method are that
it is sometimes considered “messy.”
Foam can be inconvenient because it
cannot be inserted more than 30 rninues
before intercourse.

Another alternative of bith control is
the controversial IUD. “There were
two types of IUDs available,” said
Devoe. “However, the copper-7 IUD
has been removed from the market.”
Although the IUD has been associated
with infections and infertility, Devoe
said the removal of the product was due
to litigation concerns and not the un-
safeness of the product. “Because of
the high risk of students becoming in-
fertile,” said Devoe, “in the past few
years the clinic has hardly inserted
them unless they were requested.”

Many choose the diaphragm because

it has virtually no physical side—effects.
However, “the problem with this form
and others which must be inserted
directly before intercourse,” Devoe
said, “is patient responsibility. Some
women forget their diaphragm or other
form of birth control, and instead of
abstention, some tend to take
chances.”

A natural method of preventing
pregnancy besides abstention, accord-
ing to Devoe, is called Cervical Mucus
Basic Body Temperature. This method
depends on accurate records of a
woman’s daily temperature, menstrual
cycle and body changes. “Combining
all of these,” said Devoe, “a predic-
tion can be made as to a woman’s fer-
tile time. Here at Pitt, students don’t
seem to opt for this method.”

However, the Student Health Service
does offer classes where specialists
come in and teach the method. “The
effective rate has been pretty good,”
she said, “mainly because of good
follow—up care.”

The main reason pregnancies occur
when birth control is used, Devoe said,
is “patient failure rather than method
failure.” Statistics for pregnancies on
campus “are real hard to give,” she
stated, “because most students bypass
student health and go directly to an
abortion clinic.”

“However, students are taking ad-
vantage of the services offered by
Forbes Clinic,” commented Devoe,
“but not as many as could. ” The clinic
offers counseling on birth control,
medical exams and routine laboratory
tests at no charge to students enrolled
in the university who have paid their
health fee. Also, contraceptive supplies
can be purchased at reduced rates at the
Student Health Pharmacy.

New Curriculum aims at Renaissance grad

By Natasha Henderson
Staff Writer

In the last several years there has
been growing sentiment in the
faculty of the University of Pitts-
burgh in favor of a general reform
of the curriculum that would lead
to a restoration of liberal education
to a central place in the college’s
undertaking. — College of Arts and
Sciences, Committee on Curric-
ulum Reform, Report to the Facul-
ty, 1981.

Times have deﬁnitely changed.
It’s getting increasingly difficult for
college graduates to concentrate on
only one area of study. No longer
are colleges and companies looking
for the computer wiz who spends

all of his time behind the computer .

or the engineer who spends all of
his time with the mechanical pen-
cil and calculator. _

The concern of the academic
world is in response to the notion
that students are not learning the

‘ critical thinking and writing skills
L that prove to be essential to any

career.

Instead, colleges, including the
University of Pittsburgh, are mak-
ing a conscious effort at reforming
their undergraduate programs. The
intent of this reform is to broaden
the scope of human thought. More
colleges are becoming aware of this
need to adopt course requirements
designed to produce a modern ver-
sion of the Renaissance man —- a
rational, articulate graduate who
possesses not only knowledge in his
ﬁeld but of the world as well.

The aim is to produce graduates
with concentrated knowledge in
their field, plus a better understand-
ing of society, through courses in
art appreciation, logic, critical
writing and music, to name a few.

According to a survey that the
American Council on Education
released, over half of the nation’s
colleges and universities are
heeding calls for reform of their
undergraduate academic programs.
In response to this reform, 28 per-
cent of academic ofﬁcers polled
said their colleges had already
changed their academic programs
and an additional 27 percent said
they were planning to do so. The
ﬁndings were based on a nation-
wide sample of 468colleges and
universities. The survey covered

the 1984-85 academic year and had -

an 85 percent response rate.

Irwin Schulman, Dean of the

College of Arts and Sciences,

claims_Pitt recognized the need to

restructure the undergraduate pro-

gram and he took responsibility for
action into his own hands. Ap-

pointed dean in 1978, Schulman put
together a committee that worked
for two years on researching such
a reform. The proposals were in-
troduced in the fall of 1981 and
were designed to restore a liberal
education to a central place in the
College of Arts and Sciences. The
proposals were of two kinds: those
concerned with what they called
‘ ‘skills,’ ’,and those that addressed
the general education needs of the
students. The faculty passed the
legislation and the program is cur-
rently being funneled into long-
term existence. ‘ ‘After this year, all
new students will be under the new
program,” said Schulman.

‘ ‘What we are doing is similar to
what other institutions of higher
learning are doing,” he said. “We
had a lot of correspondence with
them to see how they were in-
stituting such program reforms.”
However, Schulman insisted that
Pitt was ahead of the trend. “We
couldn’t do it overnight, though.
Instead, we have tried to phase the
new program in gently.”

The program that Pitt is current- I

1y adhering to follows the changes
recommended in national reports by
the National Institute of Education.

Firstly, they are emphasizing the
freshman year through the addition
of classes designed to enhance the
students’ ability to write and think
critically. A Pitt study indicated that
nearly half its freshmen are in need
of a remedial writing course, al-
though the university draws stu-
dents with better than average col-
lege board scores.

Pitt has also established a basic
two-year liberal arts background
for all undergraduates in all areas
of academics. In this liberal arts
background, they are placing an
emphasis on increased analysis,
better communication skills and a
broader knowledge of the
humanities.

In a report that appeared in the
Chronicle of Higher Education in
1985, the National Endowment for
the Humanities suggested that for
colleges to make students more
well-versed they must place strong-
er emphasis on the humanities.
They also suggested that faculty ac-
complish this goal by giving

. 

humanities a central place in the
academic world. They further sug-
gested that schools should use
originality in humanities and that
the best faculty members should
teach core courses. Pitt is current-
ly adhering to these standards.

It is the belief of the university
that a general education in the
humanities is essential in the
development of its students. The
aim of humanities requirements is
to enrich their lives with the truth
of art, and to make them creative
participants in the civilized life of
their ancestors and contemporaries.

“I believe the students are get-
ting ‘better’ educated this way,”
said Schulman. He also believes
that Pitt currently has a more liberal
view on education than it ever had
in the past. “The ﬁinction of liberal
education is for people to get an
idea of what a great civilization we
are inheriting,” said Schulman.

Through extensive course work
in a student’s concentration of
studies and through a wide range of
choice in his electives and required
core courses, Schulman is hoping
that the reform will strike a perfect
balance between the -freedom of
choice and the theories on what
everyone should learn.

“Our new distribution of classes
is not as loose as the old distribu-

By Patrick Good

In a time when universities across
the country are in the process of
revising curriculum to promote a
more-rounded graduate, Pitt’s
Graduate School of Business is tak-
ing the lead in a national effort to ex-
tend these diversifying qualities to
shaping America’s future business
leaders. Training students to be bet-
ter managers and leaders is the new
direction that America’s graduate
business schools will take.

Traditionally, business graduate
programs have conducted an intense
curriculum of business skills from an
analytical approach. Many master’s
‘ of business administration programs
have done virtually nothing to teach
leadership skills, aside from discuss-
ing the concepts of good leadership

and proper managerial skills. The
aspect of behavioral skills of
managers has, seemingly, been lost
between the textbook pages.

There now seems to be a shift in
attention toward the behavioral
aspects of training managers to be
better leaders. H. J. Zoffer, the dean
of the University of Pittsburgh
Graduate School of Business and
president of the American Assembly
of Collegiate Schools of America,
said he certainly feels that this is the
case at Pitt.

“The corporate world has in-
creased its demand for better trained
managers,” said Zoffer. "The highly
competitive institutions of our
business world have voiced their con-
cern about the lack of trained
managers as good leaders.

“Now educators have begun to
focus on leadership skills as an area

of needed improvement. More atten-

tion is being directed at the behavioral

tion,” claimed Schulman. “Cur-
rently, we have adopted 150 or so
new W-courses designed for studies
in specific areas of learning, ’ ’ said
Schulman. This way the student can
structure his electives into a
valuable learning experience. In the
past, the electives were perceived
as being “blow-offs.”

Pitt has also developed computer
programs to more efficiently help
students keep track of exactly
where they are in the distribution
of their classes and what they will
need to take to fulﬁll all their
requirements.

“One way we keep the courses
fresh is by designated committees
established to review the courses
annually,” said Schulman. Each
committee is composed of faculty
members and two students.
Schulman encourages all students
to get involved and become an ac-
tive participant in referring to ad-
ministrators what courses should
stay and which should go. “The
student government assigns
students to these committees. I sug-
gest if you’re interested to contact
them,” said Schulman.

Regardless of the faculty and ad-
ministrators’ views on creating a
more well-rounded student, still the
question remains — How does the

I

aspect of leadership that’s necessary
to be a better leader in the business
institutions of our world.”

Pitt’s graduate business program,
headed by Zoffer, is currently in-
volved in an experimental program
funded by a Westinghouse grant
started back in 1982. The purpose of
the program is to pursue the personal
skills of its MBA students. Zoffer told
of the program’s aims and the com-
plexity of the situation this ex-
perimental project faces.

“The ‘delivery system,’ as it’s
referred to, measures a variety of new
dimensions that lead to the develop-
ment of leaders,” Zoffer said. “It’s
not so [important] how much some-
one knows, but how these managers
and leaders communicate skills to
conduct meetings, exercise authori-
ty, to solve problems and resolve con-
ﬂict, to negotiate more effectively and
to learn other various dimensions.
This program looks to expose

students to these dimensions that
make them better leaders.

“We’re not suggesting that the
capacity for leadership is easy to ad-
dress. The behavioral aspect of
teaching leadership is a complex pro-
cess. It entails so many different
variables, or modules, which we
prefer to call them."

The process of coordinating such
a program is so important to Zoffer
and Pitt that the assignment to head
the program was given to a top assis-
tant to the dean. Ray Damm, the
director of the experimental pro-
grams, has certainly done just that —
experiment. Over the past ﬁve years,
the program has changed gradually,
based on tests assessing students’
abilities as managers. In cooperation
with the Development Dimensions
International, Damm has set up an
assessment center to test andobserve
the progress of his leadership skills

student view these changes‘?

Brenda Allen, a senior physical
therapy major at Pitt, strongly
believes in the diversiﬁcation of the
reform. “Many students in profes-
sional schools will say that they
don’t need music, literature, an-
thropology or reasoning courses,”
she said. “These students will in-
deed be able to perform their jobs

without these courses. But they will I

be no more than technicians or
aides performing an act.

“As a physical therapist I am in
contact with a large number of peo-
ple. Mv well-rounded education is
put to use every day,” said Allen.
“I ﬁnd that I can converse with
everyone —— from welfare mothers
to corporate executives. The
awareness of the reality of the
world around me is augmented by_
the understanding that people are
different for good reasons, but still
fundamentally the same.’ ’

On the other hand, Stephanie
Lyle, a sophomore English writing
major, disagrees with the required
courses: “Personally I feel that
speciﬁc course requirements that
are not speciﬁed by a given depart-
ment are not a good idea. I feel that
it is the student’s and advisor’s
responsibility to determine what is
relevant curriculum for that par-
ticular student.” '

The assessment center has adopted
DDI’s Management-Interaction
Series as a framework of the pro-
gram. Subsequent tests have been
added to assess how well the students
are progressing. A workbook and ap-
plied leadership workshops provide
students with examples of real-life
situations they should learn to deal
with. Damm, who directs and teaches
the management training course, ex-
plained the program’s skills
workshop. .

" “They [students] role—play real-life
situations in controlled situations,”
said Damm. ‘ ‘They learn theories in
the classrooms, and the workshops
provide a blending of all the theories
and the leadership skills together.

‘ ‘Through the actual situations they
learn ‘improving work habits, to avoid
conﬂicts, authority delegating, to set

» goals and standards and other aspects

of leadership. They [educators] used
to teach it — now they’re [students]
living it,” said Damm.

One student who has participated
in the workshops of the Manage-
ment—Interaction Series is Scott
Muirhead. For this current graduate
student, practice will make perfect,
he hopes. Well, at least near-
perfect.

“Part of the program is practice,”
said Muirhead, who recently com-
pleted the program. “You gain con-
ﬁdence, and it makes you more com-
fortable. It’s one thing to read about
leadership training, but you get more
out of it when you actually do it in
the workshops. You get out of it ex-
actly what you put into it.”

The program, because it is still in
its experimental stages, is purely op-
tional to graduate students. No credit
is awarded, but the opportunity for
additional experience is an incentive.
In every workshop situation, each
student acts in alternate positions as
a supervisor, an employee, an
observer and as a moderator. The
workshop sessions allow the student
to receive several different views of
each trouble situation. In this in-
stance, the student gains a better
knowledge of how to handle himself
if he is ever to face a similar situation.

‘‘I’m really satisﬁed about the pro-
gram,” Muirhead later said. “The
different modules and topics ranging
from meeting leadership to
supervisor—management respon-
sibilities taught us greatly about
things normally you only read
about.”

Not only does the program teach
the various theories, but the students
learn how to apply them to speciﬁc
situations. In the eight-week—long—
program, a series of eight different
modules , from the Management—
Interaction Series are covered. One
such module for overcoming
employee resentment, according to
Muirhead, taught him and others
more than could be learned from a
textbook.

“Just in that one module,’

9

said

Muirhead. “I learned how to talk to
an unhappy employee by role—playing
both sides ofthe situation, as well as
learning from the viewpoints of an
observer and as a moderator. Having
the chance to participate in all four
situations really teaches the student
to think more clearly before taking
any action.

“From this particular session we
learned how to explain why
something didn’t work out. Most im-
portantly, we learned how to give
positive feedback. From these situa-
tions, we leam to react rationally and
to think a problem through.”

One professor, Dr. Ralph Kilmann,
has been teaching a similar type of

“The corporate world
has increased its demand
for better-trained manag-
ers. The highly competitive
institutions of our business
world have voiced their
concern about the lack of
trained managers as good

leaders. ”
H. S. Zoffer
Dean, Graduate School
of Business

leadership behavior at Pitt for 14
years, and he, too, has stressed in-
teraction to his students. In his
Organization Analysis course,
Kilmann stresses the complex prob-
lems that managers face and the ap-

proaches to solving such problems.

“I emphasize that we [educators]
must provide material that introduces
them to follow and solve complex
problems,” said Kilmann, “and not
just simple problems.

“Complex business problems have
many various aspects to them, such
as marketing, ﬁnance, accounting and
others, that all must be blended
together. I stress that they [students]

‘ get a team together that must be able

to interact. In this way, they work
together, for one goal, for better
management of conflict.”

Regular class instruction is not
overlooked, however. As Kilmann
mentioned, the new type of programs
do more than teach —— they promote
action. “This program provides dif-
ferent cases for my students to
study,” said Kilmann. “Four to six
students share the responsibility of
expressing their views and to interact
with one another to come to a
resolution.

This new type of management
training would seem to be quite ef-
fective in its approach. Yet, Pitt is
one of only six schools known to be
experimenting with such an idea for
training its students. Of almost 700
MBA programs nationally, only one,
Elvirna College in Minnesota, has a
mandatory training course as part of
its curriculum needed for graduation.
one, Elvirna College in Minnesota,
has a mandatory training course as
part of its curriculum needed for
graduation.

For the University of Pittsburgh,
a mandatory course is still in the plan-
ning stages. “We’re reﬁning the pro-
gram,” said Zoffer, “to know how
effective it can be. If we can ﬁnd a
way to include this experience in with
the other curriculum [courses] then
it will occur. For now, it’s still up in
the air.”

The program is predominantly
under Damm’s direction, and he re-
mains quite optimistic of its becom-
ing a required course of Pitt’s
graduate curriculum.

“I think it will move to a man-
datory program,” said Damm. “It’s
how that it moves to that point that’s
important. It must come to be blended
in with the current curriculum that we
follow.”

Zoffer’s school remains in a
minority of those experimenting with
such a new program. The others are
watching closely to see what happens,
and the dean of Pitt’s MBA school

readily agrees that he’s taking a

chance.

“There’s no question we’re taking
a chance,” Zoffer said. “Which sug-
gests we would rather have exper-
ienced leaders trained for manage—
ment and not just a concern for hav-
ing bright people.

“A handful of schools are in-
terested in what we do with the pro-

gram. Some of the other schools have s

remained skeptical, and still others
are watching and observing us with
a watchful eye.”

Presently, Pitt is in the forefront of

such an experimental educational pro
gram. Damm and the others closely
associated with Pitt’s voluntary
management training program do not
hesitate to commend the top-20
business school’s involvement.

“We’re making our knowledge

available to other interested schools,~’—’...

said Damm. “Everyone is looking at
[us] to see how effective this program
can be. This places Pitt at the top, as
the leader, of a new emerging train-
ing program.”

The PittNews,   

Quadriplegic student deals with daily life

By Jeanne McNutt
For The Pitt News

“That’s me and my younger sister
Pam at Camp Rosary,” Kim Cochran
gestured with her head toward a framed
montage of old photographs. The Kim
of camp days looks back with dark,
placid, obedient eyes. Frozen moments
on the paneled wall, still in time — Kim
the babysitter, Kim the Girl Scout, the
sorority president, the social worker.

Today, settled in her favorite rocker
in her tiny room, Kim speaks with

"some difﬁculty. She faces a row of
ﬂowering irnpatiens on a newly-stained
deck, one her father designed to adjoin
her room and extend her boundaries.

Her deep brown eyes demand atten-
tion, though her head gently sways to
no particular rhythm, and her
114-pound body, paralyzed from the

neck down, moves in quiet spasms. '

Kim is a 35-year-old quadriplegic,
paralyzed by rare complications that
I followed the birth of her only child,
Craig. She is also a graduate student
at Pitt, working hard to become a
rehabilitation counselor.

Amidst piles of -schoolwork and
books Kim said, “I never would have
gone to graduate school before the ac-
cident — I would have wanted to, but
wouldn’t have had the conﬁdence.uIn
a way, I’m doing more now than be-
fore.” '

Kim’s troubles began 11 years ago,
after what seemed like a routine
pregnancy and delivery. Amniotic ﬂuid
inexplicably backed up into Kim’s
lungs, starting an odd course of com-
plications. Over a period of months
Kim’s body succumbed to complete
ﬂaccidity, total paralysis and eventual-
ly, spastic contractions. It was a freak
incident, one in a million, and almost
always fatal, Kim was told. .

In strict medical terms, Kim did die
three times on the way to Presbyterian-

University Hospital, and for three
months lay comatose with collapsed
lungs, connected to a respirator and
barely connected to life.

Kim regained consciousness,
astonishing the doctors. A constant
supply of oxygen kept Kim from suf-
fering brain damage, but the prognosis
on her ravaged body was dim: Spastic
Quadriplegia (paralysis of arms and
legs with limited muscle control).

Kim was transferred to the I-larmar-
ville Rehabilitation Center, where she
learned to lift her legs high — a

‘ ‘I used to think I could talk
my way around people. It
wasn ’t until the assertiveness
training classes and a few
real incidents of insensitivity,
that I realized how much I
had to learn. ”

strength needed for the wheelchair
bound.

After two years of grueling therapy
at Harmarville, Kim returned home to
her husband in a wheelchair. In a
backlash of confused feelings, from
grief and frustration to anger and guilt,
the marriage collapsed. Separated and
severely depressed, Kim returned
home to her parents and the home
where she was reared.

The tidy brown and white, seven-
room house at 1107 Eighth Ave. in
Brackenridge, Pa., belongs to Frank
and Ruth Chesare. They’re the kind of
neighbors you’d choose if you could:
generous and trustworthy, with a deep
respect for people and things. Carefully
preserved in aluminum siding, the
home, according to Frank, is a “pre-
Sears and Roebuck prefabrication.”

One of the many small do-it-your-
selfers on a quiet street of retired
millworkers, the Chesare home
overlooks the Allegheny Ludlum Steel
works with its idle smokestacks tower-
ing high along the Allegheny River.

An errant leg kicks from beneath her
well-worn rocker, as Kim reflects on
a time when monsters ruled and devils
conjured. “I didn’t even recognize
myself then. I hated me, the world and
even Craig for a while.” Bitter rage
prevailed with the years of frustration.
She laughs now at her pathetic attempts
to “end it all” by throwing her limp
body out of bed, and again out of a
shower onto a cold wet tile floor —
with nothing gained but bruises.

“I watched television all day, every
day — for about a year and a half,"
Kim recalled. “But I knew ﬁnally that
enough was enough after I read a book
called ‘Options’ — about others severe-
ly handicapped who had done good
things with their lives.”

With hardly an inkling of her own
possibilities, Kim called her rehabilita-
tion counselor and said, “I’m ready for
‘something.’ ”

Kim entered the United Cerebral

-Palsy Independent Living Center in

Oakland as a day student. And for one
year she learned occupational skills:
typing, writing (she can write her
name, which Kim admitted only she
can read) and assertiveness training.

Role-playing typical and often
distressing situations encountered in a
world designed for the non-disabled,
Kim first tested her emotional strength
at the center. “I used to think I could
talk my way around people," she said.
“It wasn’t until the assertiveness train-
ing classes and a few real incidents of
insensitivity, that I realized how much
I had to learn.”

After one rude person told her that
he “would not move his seat for no
damned wheelchair,” Kim realized,
after the tears, she would have to de-

fend her personal territory -— and
identity.

“I don’t let waiters and waitresses
ask my family and friends, ‘What
would she like?’ ” she said, mention-
ing occasions when she had been
treated as if she couldn’t hear or speak.

Eyes ﬁery with indignation, Kim
continued her grievances. “I hate when
someone won't look at me.” The
thought of being ignored sends Kim’s
head bobbing. “It’s worse than being

stared at,” which is typical of adults,
she said, but not of children. Children,
honest and direct, will confront Kim
and often ask “What’s the matter with
you?”

“The thing is, if I can just get them
to look me in the eye, I know I can
break down their barriers ... then I just
smile and sometimes say hello,” she
said simply_.

Because of her progress that year,
the United Way and United Cerebral
Palsy asked Kim to be their volunteer
advocate, and publicly represent their
organizations. '

‘ ‘It took me a long time to feel at ease
in front of large groups -— like giving
a speech’ to a packed crowd at the
William Penn Hotel,” she said.

“I’ll never forget the time I was
rolled down to the Wheel and Axle
Division of a U.S. Steel plant to cam-
paign for the United Way. The whistle
blew to stop work, and about 200
workers took off their hard hats and
really listened to me.”

Promoting these agencies, Kim’s
public image grew as she participated
in the making of a commercial and a
short movie and appeared on talk show
programs.

Kneeling by an open dresser, at the
feet of Kim’s rocker, Ruth Chesare,
whose youthfulness belies her 56 years,
punctuated Kim’s storytelling with her
own details. Once a nurse, her account
is mixed with pragmatism and pride.

From a drawer brimming with
newsclips, awards and assorted
documentation, Ruth located and
displayed two prizes: this year’s Ben-

jamin Rush Award for Community
Service and a runner-up.trophy for
Miss Wheelchair Pennsylvania 1980.
“You know, I often forget Kim is
handicapped,” she said.

For Kim, with each new strength a
goal is measured. As a short term goal,
Kim wants better hand coordination, to
independently control her wheelchair‘.

“I need to grasp things more —— like
ﬁnger foods and door knobs,’ ’ she said,
“and start pushing buttons and open-
ing more doors by myself.”

In the long run, Kim hopes to be I

employed and live on her own.

Outside on the manicured lawn,
Frank pointed to a grassy slope where
he plans to build a walk and ramp to
streamline access from the street to
Kim’s bedroom. He pointed again to
the woods beyond, the Harrison Hills,
where during Kim’s most fragile
months, he took long walks and con-
fronted his daughter’s uncertain life.

“I can’t believe she’s come this far, ’ ’
he said, nodding his head in approval.
“She’s a survivor, a dreamer  .a
ﬁghter,” he said.

Adult day care:

New solution tackles
old problem

By Jeanne McNutt
For The Pitt News

For 15 years, Mary, 76 years old and
widowed, lived on her own. But when
her memory began to fade, and routine

activities like shopping and meeting .

friends for lunch confused and upset
her, her family realized she needed
help. ’

Her son Allen and his wife Sally
made Mary a first-ﬂoor apartment in
their Pittsburgh home — and hoped the
companionship and small chores they
could offer would support her in car-
ing for herself.

“The arrangement didn’t last long,”
said Sally. “Because we were at work
most of the day, we hadn’t noticed how
depressed and disoriented she had

. become. She missed her friends and

familiar surroundings. She didn’t trust
herself to leave the house — or know
what to do with her time inside. So she
sat alone and waited for us to return.”

When their doctor told them Mary
had not been eating and was los_ing too
much weight, it became clear to the
Smiths that Mary could no longer be
responsible for her own well-being.

The couple considered their options:
They could hire a home nurse or com-
panion, which would have been too
costly; or they could place Mary in a
nursing home, ‘ ‘which would have ter-
rified Mary — and made us all
miserable,” Sally said. Although Sal-
ly, Mary and Allen are fictitious
names, they do exist and their problem
is very real.

A geriatric social worker told the
Crafts ‘about Council Care, and for the
past six months Mary has been spend-
ing four days a week at this adult day-
care center. A special public van for
the aged picks Mary up at her door at

8 a.m. and returns her at 4 p.m. By the
end of a busy day, Mary has: com-
pleted a painting, listened to or par-
ticipated in a current events discussion,
exercised to music, contributed stitch-
ing to a community quilt and shared a
hot, nutritious noonday meal with her
friends.

“I’m convinced her depression is in
check since she started the program,”
said Sally. “We’ve seen positive
changes — and. no more periods of
withdrawal. Mary looks forward to go-
ing to the center and is more talkative
when she returns. She’s only depressed
when the center is closed for a holi-
day,” she said. “In fact, her appetite
is back -— and in the past few months,
she’s gained 10 pounds!’; I .

According to the latest U.S. Depart-
ment of Aging reports, the fastest
growing segment of the American
population is 75 years and older. Most
of these people are or will be depend-
ent upon children or a spouse. It is not
surprising, then, that adult day-care
centers, like Council Care (just two
years old and ﬁlled to capacity) are
ﬂourishing across the country.

The goals of adult day care are sim-
ple: to provide a safe, supervised pro-
gram for elderly persons who can no
longer care for themselves, but whose
health is not so impaired that they re-
quire institutional placement, and to
relieve their families of the demanding
and often stressful job of care-giving.

The average age of the adult day-care
client is 80, and the majority are
women. Most have some form of
dementia, or memory loss, including
Alzheimer’s disease, and others may
suffer from strokes, arthritis or blind-
ness. Whatever the disability, each
center prescribes an individual care
plan and assesses it regularly.

Dr. Barbara Shore, director of the

doctoral program of social work at the
University of Pittsburgh, said, “The
evidence is strong that the challenges
offered by this type of program can
help maintain an elderly person’s abili-
ty to function — and as a result, raise
his or her feelingsiof self-worth. It is
definitely one of our more wonderful
inventions S”

Adult day care began in the mid-30s
in Canada and Russia in the form of
psychiatric outpatient hospitals. The
concept spread through England, Den-
mark and other European countries
with national health-care programs. In

-1971, the White House Conference on

Aging called for the development of
“alternatives to institutional care for
the elderly.” Since then, American
communities have established 800
federally and privately funded adult
day-care centers, many in former
churches, schools and office buildings.

Clients are usually referred to day-
care programs by social service agen-
cies, home health-care associations,
hospitals and physicians. “The support
from the community is overwhelm-
ing,” said Cathy Lasansky, director of
the Lower Westchester YM-YWHA
Community Day Care Center in Mt.
Vernon, a city with an elderly popula-
tion over 13,000.

Adult day-care centers may vary in
size, client-staff ratio, fee (many ad-
just according to need, most average
$15 per day) and level of medical
supervision. Most have a nurse on
staff, a doctor on call and are afﬁliated
with a local hospital for emergency
care. ‘

One of the oldest, On-Lok Senior
Health Services, located in a former
nightclub in San Francisco’s
Chinatown, boasts a staff of 200 and
provides a full range of medical ser-
vices to 300 ‘poor elderly. Council

Care, nestled in wooded hills outside
the city, emphasizes the ‘social and
emotional needs of its 37 clients in a
new and intimate setting.

In the spacious sunny room at Coun-
cil Care, volunteers in orange aprons
quietly assist the especially frail in
games and crafts. Scrabble, bridge and
a modified Trivil Pursuit are favorites.
Most players are attentive and in-
volved. “Be careful — I’ni feeling
bright today!” said 75-year-old Edith,
having just given her third correct trivia
answer.

“We challenge strengths, not weak-
nesses,” said staff psychologist Zaga
Blockstein, “without demanding things
they can’t realistically do.”

How do newcomers adjust to the
adult day-care program?

“Marcella resisted ﬁercely at the
beginning,” said Sue. “Not knowing
the people or what she would do there
frightened her. She thought we were
trying to get rid of her.”' '

‘ ‘Most associate the day-care concept
with traditional child-care programs,
and of course they resent it, ’ ’ said Ben-
jamin Zimmer, geriatric psychiatrist at
Western Psychiatric Hospital. _‘ ‘To call
it ‘day care’ is anunfortunate choice
of wording that should be reconsid-

Th€':"*Pitt"Niews§"llrfaréli"l9,*'l986"l if

ered. ”

Most adult day-care specialists agree
it takes four to six weeks for clients to
settle into this type of program.

Counseling sessions and support
groups, provided by many centers, help
clients and families cope with the

physical and emotional challenges of

aging.

Mary Jo Kelly, director of adult day
care at Vintage, Inc., also in Pitts-
burgh, said, “Often clients just want
to vent frustrations. When a client is
losing’ grasp, we try to explain the
physical reasons — and assure them

-that while they are here — they are

safe.” _
, At support sessions, caregivers can
learn from each other solutions to prob-

lems they have in common. Upon such‘

advice, one elderly man now keeps
oven knobs in his pockets, to protect
himself and his frail and disoriented
wife while she‘ is home. .

When Clara Dorsey is home, her
82-year-old husband, James, must
dress, feed and sometimes restrain her.
In the year since Clara enterd Vintage,
her Alzheimer symptoms have ad-
vanced and have greatly diminished her
verbal and social skills.

Adult day care

continued from page 10

While Clara is at the center ﬁve days
a week, James keeps house, visits
friends and helps at his son’s music
store.

“I don’t care how much you love
them, you’d be sadly disappointed if
you tried to do it all yourself. You need
to do your thing, too,” said James.

Adult day-care specialists advise
caregivers not to wait until their burden
becomes overwhelming before seeking
support. The dangers in doing so, they
say, are: The caregiver may withdraw
attention from his or her elderly, frail
family member, or worse, become
abusive; stress and anger may cause
family relationships to deteriorate; and
ﬁnally, by the time help is sought, the
elderly family member may have be-
come too impaired for day-care super-
vision -— leaving no options except the
institution.

In economically-depressed Winne-
bago County, 111., health ofﬁcials
recently completed a study onabuse of
the elderly. As a result, ﬁve clients, in-
cluding one couple, were placed in the
safety of the Bright Side Adult Day
Care Center in downtown Rockford.
Center director Sue Crandall said,
“The extent of mistreatment is incred-
ible in some cases._ We’re ﬁnding
children preying on the Social Securi-
ty checks of their severely impaired
parents.”

"As an aging society that depends
more on the family to ﬁll in the gaps
to care for sick, elderly citizens, the
adult day-care program deserves our
full support,” said Pennsylvania
Senator John Heinz, chairman of the
Special Committee on Aging. Heinz
recently introduced a bill into Congress
to appropriate more money for com-
munity home health-care services,
which will include adult day care.

“It will take at least two years before
there is action on the bill,”said Orr,
who is lobbying in its support. “We
can’t abandon the family. We need to
aid the caregivers in whatever way we
can,” she added. -

While Medicaid and Medicare cover
non—proﬁt nursing home and other
long-term institutional care costs for the
poor elderly, neither covers adult day-
care services in most states.

“In a sense, this encourages many
families to choose the more affordable
but often less humane choice,” said

Linda Orr, vice president of the‘

Western Pennsylvania Adult Day Care
Association and director of Council
Care. Studies suggest that 30 percent
of those in nursing homes should be
receiving community services instead.

By Julie Hunt
For The Pitt News

Editor’s Note:

On March 9, Julie Hunt, the coor-
dinator of Pitt’s Campus Women’s
Organization, along with several other
Pitt students, attended the March for
Women’s lives in Washington D.C.
The march organized by the National
Organization for Women, attracted
80,000 marchers and was thought by
many leaders of the women’s move-
ment to be a sign of its rejuvenation.
The main purpose of the march was to
demonstrate to legislators that the ma-

jority of the American public is in favor —

of safe and legal birth control and abor-
tion. As NOW President Ellie Smeal
said, addressing the crowd last Sunday,
“Our message is simple. You cannot
play with women’s lives any longer;
stop playing with our lives.” The
following article is a personal account
of the march.
10:27 a.m.

As we near Washington, the excite-
ment heightens. Everyone on the bus
writes letters to our senators to be

delivered by my friend Chimene and
I, who will stay on until tomorrow to
lobby our congressmen.

Driving through Washington, .

everyone wakes and leans to the win-
dows. Today, the streets are crowded

with marchers from all over. mmw
unloading interesting signs from their
vehicles. We unloaded, put together

our signs and banners and headed over

to where all the college groups were
lining up. Everyone was lined up on

a huge, wide strip ‘of grass known as

the Mall. Each college received its own
official sign stating the name of the
university. I saw signs from all over

— from Florida State to Cornell. The
striking thing about the crowd was its
diversity. I saw banners for church
groups, atheist groups, gay and lesbian  o- 1
groups and political groups. There

were also NOW chapters from all over.
Another thing that struck me was the
large proportion of men who came out

— I’d estimate 35 percent. I suppose

they realized the impact of this issue

on everyone. As we waited for the
march to begin, enthusiasm was
sparked by a speech over the PA
system and the crowd started to chant

and sing. Many of the signs that peo-

ple had made were quite amusing and
some were very graphic. Some par-
ticular ones read, “Who Rules Your

glued to this sign.
1 p.m. B

Although the march was to begin at
noon, it took an hour for everyone
ahead of us to start marching so we
could move. The energy level was high
and the pace brisk as we moved into
the blocked-off streets, marching 12
across. The chants, songs and shouts
of mycomrades were the only thing
audible. The roads were lined with
police officers, spectators and an oc-

/gfasional pro—lifer. The few pro-lifers
-that did show up only held signs in

silence, too overwhelmed by our
numbers to risk verbal confrontation.
1:20 p.m.- '

As we walked by the White House,
I was disappointed that Reagan was not
there to witness our enthusiasm,
sincerity and numbers. Unfortunately,
he was at Camp David for the
weekend.

3:30 p.m.

The rest of the afternoon was spent
relaxing and listening to a wide spec-
trum of notorious advocates of this

issue. Politicians, NOW leaders,
singers, actresses and religious leaders
spoke —- persons like Bella Abzug and
the Rev. Faith Evans. The climax for
me as a feminist was when Gloria
Steinem addressed the crowd about the
tragedy that threatens to befall our
country. “Reagan ignores the more
than 70 percent of the people that don’t
believe that abortion should be
criminalized,” she said to a cheering
crowd.
4:45’ p.m.
The buses lined up waiting to depart
as the rally wound down. No one could
argue about the day’s success. What we
had all experienced, the impact of the
union, our idealism and the heightened
consciousness of this issue will remain
with everyone long after the superficial
memories of the March for Women’s
Lives fade. Although the majority of
Pittsburghers departed, a busload of us
remained to lobby and went to our hotel
for the night.

7:15 p.m. ,

We watch the news for a story on the
march from our hotel room. There was
an arrest, said the report, but it was not
due to the radicalism of our crowd. A

pro-lifer had apparently run through the
crowd carrying a fetus and displaying
it to the marchers. The vileness of this
barbaric, repugnant act only proceeded
to strees the disparity in mentality be-
tween our crowd and some of our
fanatical opposition. The march was
extremely well run, and nowhere had
I seen the anti-social displays that often
result when this number of people are
put together. Instead there were peo-
ple, everywhere, united for a cause.

Monday 9 a.m.

We arrived at the Folger Library, a
building beside the Capitol, dressed up
and ready to lobby. Our specific target
was the passage of the Civil Rights
Restoration Act. In 1984, the Supreme
Court tragically reversed former inter-
pretations of civil rights laws that pro-
hibited discrimination in all areas of an.
institution that receives federal funding.
Our goal was to pressure legislators
into passing the act without the rider
that would outlaw abortion. Our day of
lobbying began with a meeting of the
participants. Most of the lobbyists were
older women — NOW members and
leaders who had done all this before.

They told my friend and Ito stick with
them to see how things were done.
Basically, we were to make appoint-
ments with the representative trom our

1 district and to see our senators. We 1

were to go in groups, explain the issues
at stake and point out the urgency of
our cause. Excitedly, I set out with
some other Pittsburghers while a news
camera followed our progress.

1:15 p.m.

Relaxing in a cafeteria. I reflected on
our progress. We had resigned
ourselves to visiting representatives
since neither Heinz nor Specter were
in. Our visits seemed to make a dif-
ference; they left an impression on our
representatives about what the people
really want. Whether they agreed with
us or not, all of the people we talked
to were quite affable. Some did not
seem to grasp the impact of this legisla-
tion until we pointed out the implica-
tions of the issue. With those who were
not in Washington, we left notes and
reading material and talked to the
legislative aides.

3:30 p.m.
The highlight of the day came when
we lobbied Pittsburgh Representative

Page 13

Doug Walgren, a supporter of our
issue, with Ellie Smeal, who had once
lived in Mt. Lebanon. Cameras,
reporters and photographers followed

us into the room simply because they .

followed Ellie everywhere. They came

from newspapers such as The New York

lzmes and magazines like U.S. News

and World Report. There was even a
reporter from Italy who told us she

would get our message to the Pope. It’
was thrilling just to be in the room as

the two talked over the issues and about

the march.

4:30 p.m. ~

Finally, we returned to the bus for
the ride back to Pittsburgh, my feet
aching from the pennance of wearing
heels. The ride home seemed short
since I got to sit next to my Pitt cohort,
Chimene Brandt. We discussed our im-
pressions of the trip and she gave ‘me
her thoughts on the march. ‘ ‘I thought
the march was a great success, and a
victory for women everywhere.
Women must realize that a basic human
right, freedom of choice, could be
taken away from them and that the right
to choose is one step closer to total

equality between women and men.” .

After Karl’s release

Coachin

By Randy Miller
Assistant Sports Editor

The United Press International said

Tuesday that sources claim George.

Karl, a leading candidate for the vacant
Pitt basketball coaching position, has
been offered a ﬁve—year, $1 million
deal at the University of Pittsburgh.

Karl, however, who was fired Sun-
day as head coach of the National
Basketball Association’s Cleveland
Cavaliers, denied such an offer.

"I have not been offered the job,”
Karl. said in Tuesday’s Pittsburgh
Press. “But I would expect as part of
the procedure of the search that I might

get some contact later this week.”

Karl was fired from his post at
Cleveland last week after his name had
surfaced for weeks as being a candidate
for the Pitt job; which was left vacant
by Roy Chipman, who resigned Dec.
18. Chipman’s resignation becomes ef-
fective at the end of this season.

Cavaliers general manager Harry
Weltman said at Karl’s ﬁring that his
club needed a head coach who could
give a full commitment to the Cavs’
making the playoffs this season.

“In view of the fact that he is actively
interviewing for another position, ’ ’

World record

llVorld record holder Lee MRe

Weltman said, “we think it is in our
best interests to release him from any
further obligations to the Cavs in the
current season.

“This will permit Karl to turn his full
attentions to secure a new position.”

A Cavs spokeman said yesterday that
when Karl had asked the team’s per-
mission to talk to Pitt ofﬁcials, it was
granted.

Karl, 34, became the youngest coach
in the NBA when the Cavs hired him
at the beginningof the 1984-85 season.
After Cleveland won only two of its
ﬁrst 21 games, Karl led the Cavs into
the playoffs before bowing out against
the Eastern Division Champion Boston
Celtics.

Karl was interviewed at Pitt last
Thursday and Friday, but no universi-
ty official would comment.

“I have not heard from Pitt since last
Saturday,” Karl said. “I do not know
what is happening now. I am an-
ticipating what is going to happen from
Pitt, but I do not know what they are
going to do.”

There are rumors Pitt will offer the
position to Navy head coach Paul
Evans. Evans has expressed interest in
the Pitt job, but his Midshipmen are
currently alive and well in the Final 16
of the NCAA Tournament.

Chaz Palla/The Pitt News

It is only speculation, but Pitt will
probably await Navy’s fate before an-
nouncing a decision. ‘

Evans reportedly has been
approached by a number of other
schools about a coaching position, in-‘
cluding the University of Southern
California.

It is believed that Evans is Pitt’s No.
1 choice, but if he turns down the of-
fer, Karl would then, and only then,
be hired.

It would be a homecoming of sorts
for Karl if he is hired by Pitt. Karl is
a native of suburban Penn Hills. He left

_the area to play college ball at the

University of North Carolina, where he
won All—America honors as a senior.
He played five years of professional
ball, averaging 7.0 points per game in
three years in the defunct American

. Basketball Association before scoring

2.6 in two NBA seasons. He was
forced to retire in 1978 after suffering
knee problems.

Karl has spent his time since gather-

ing more than enough credentials for 8
him to coach at a major university.

Before becoming head coach at
Cleveland, Karl was an assistant coach
for the NBA’s San Antonio Spurs and
a head coach in the Continental Basket-
ball League.

,asvary ecstatic over

By Roy Bigler
Staff Writer

“Unbelievably happy!” That is the
way that the men’s head coach John
Vasvary described his feelings after this
past weekend’s performance by six of
his athletes at the NCAA Track and
Field Championships.

The biggest story to come out of the

meet was Lee McRae. McRae has con-
sistently shown throughout the season
that he is among the world’s best when
it comes to running the 55—meter dash.
At the championships last weekend, he
turned in deﬁnitive proof. In the ﬁnals
of the 55-meter dash he not only won,
but he set a new world record. McRae
crossed the line in 6.00 seconds, .02

seconds faster than Carl Lewis’
previous mark of 6.02 seconds. The
coaching staff was very thrilled over
the way that Lee came through in the
meet.

“I called Coach Lewis and had to
repeat myself at least ﬁve or six
times,” said an excited Vasvary.
Previously this season, McRae has
come close to a world record on many
occasions, but he never quite got there.
It is very apparent that Vasvary was
almost speechless over the setting of a
new world mark. “Lee’s breaking of
the world record is really unbelievable,
but then it isn’t because he has been
running that well all year. Now it is
almost as if to say, what are you going
to do next!”

Sports
job still up te air

Antonio Spurs.

Besides McRae, there were others
who ran at the meet. In the 55—meter
hurdles, Eric Cannon also turned in a
splendid performance. He ended up
fourth in the nation with a time of 7.29

‘j

{M

“Lee ’s breaking of the
world record ZS really
unbelieveable, but then it
isn ’t because he has been
running that well all
year.. Now it is almost as
if to say, what are you
going to do next! ”

— John Vasvary

“For Eric to come in and do what
he did as a freshman is really some-
thing,” praised Vasvary. Last week at
the IC4A meet, Cannon had stumbled
over a hurdle which prevented him
from placing in the meet, but he left
no doubts of his ability with his per-
formance after this weekend.
seconds. In itself, this may not be such
an amazing feat for a talented athlete
to accomplish, but taking into con-
sideration that Cannon is only a
freshman,_ it is quite an accomplish-
ment.

The remaining four people that at-
tended the meet comprised the two-
mile relay team. They managed to
ﬁnish fourth overall with a time of

George Karl during his playing days with the San

Pggelﬁ

 McRae’s time

/:2l.42. Even though they did not
finish ﬁrst in the race, their time beat
the previous collegiate record by three
seconds, The members of the team are
Bob Weiner, who ran a 1:53.6; Joe
Daniels, who came in with a 1250.2;
Tim Manes, who ran a 1148.7; and
Dave Moore, who ﬁnished it off with
a 1:48.2. Going into the meet, the team
had not been fully tested, and neither
had Manes, who had suffered a
sprained ankle at the beginning of the
season.

“Even though they did not win,- it
was really great for the guys on the
relay team to break the American Col-
legiate record by three seconds,”
Vasvary commented.

Overall, Pitt’s men placed ﬁfth in the
nation, and all six received All-
America honors. Out of the over 200
teams that attended the meet, this is
quite a showing for a team that had
previously been somewhat anonymous.
According to Vasvary, this is the best
that a team from Pitt has done at the
NCAA meet, and he is unsure of when
a team has even placed nearly this high
in the past.

Of the six men that attended the
meet, all will be returning next year.
The team is quite a young one and has
good things in store for it. Vasvary
feels that next year they will do even
better at the NCAAs. “All six of ‘those
guys will be returning, and there are
people who did not make it this time
that we feel can.”

Tennis team loses two out of three

By Gregg Ficery
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s tennis team is learn- ’

ing, but they are learning the hard way.
The Panthers again dropped two of
three matches this past weekend on
their trip through eastern Pennsylvania.
In a style very similar to the matches
of the previous weekend in Washing-
ton, D.C., strong competition halted
two inspired efforts and dropped the
squad’s record to 2-4.

The Panthers led off the weekend on
Friday with a 2-7 loss at the hands of
nemesis Bucknell in the Bisons’ Davis
Sports and Recreation Center. Of the
nine matches, six were decided in three
sets with only one going to Pitt by way
of No. 5 player Rich Monteleone. The
Panthers’ other point came at the No.
3 spot as Dave Johnson scored a
straight set victory.:

Johnson's play highlighted the
weekend for the Panthers as he
defeated all three of his singles
opponents.

“Bucknell has improved a lot from
last year,” said Coach George Dieffen-
bach after conﬁdently predicting a vic-
tory last week. “Theyrbrought in a few
scholarship players and their indoor
facility is a tough place to adjust to.”

Bucknell has now beaten Pitt men’s
tennis teams 31 of the last 32 years.

On Saturday, the squad needed to
regroup quickly in order to prepare for
a traditionally strong Lehigh team, over
whom a victory was deﬁnitely within
reach. However, it was not to be. With
Monteleone out of the lineup with a
sore elbow, the Panthers fell behind 4-2
after singles play with Johnson and Jeff
Dadowski scoring victories. Coach
George Dieffenbach’s crew would not
throw in the towel, though, as they
battled windy conditions to take two of
three doubles matches and just fell
short of a monumental comeback by a
4-5 margin.

“The guys gave the greatest fight
I’ve ever seen in that match,” Dieffen-
bach said. “It’s extremely hard to
sweep doubles when you’re down 4-2
to start with, and we almost pulled it

off. In fact. at one point in time, all
three teams were leading.”

By the time Sunday rolled around,
the team must have been happy to see
Big East foe/patsy Villanova stroll onto
the courts. Having placed sixth in the
Big East last fall as compared to the
Panthers’ second place ﬁnish, the
Wildcats gave the emotionally and
physically worn squad a chance to
breathe a little easier. Dieffenbach’s
players had clinched the win after
singles play by taking a 5-1 lead and
went on to a 6-3 victory.

Dieffenbach is still generally pleased
with his team’s overall effort and pro-
gress at this point in the season, despite
a seemingly disappointing start.

“We’ve been playing some very
competitive teams from some strong
tennis traditions,” Dieffenbach said.
“It’s a matter of overachieving. We
have to work hard to stay in every
match against an awful lot of talent.
We’ve shown a lot of fight, and we are
doing our best.”

To be more effective, Dieffenbach

said his players will need to develop

more consistency in both singles and
doubles.

“Last week our doubles needed
work,” Dieffenbach said. “This week
it improved, but our singles could have
been stronger. We’re going to need
consistent showings in singles and
doubles.”

The Panthers are now gearing up for
the heart of their local schedule. The
team travels to West Liberty State Col-
lege on Thursday and then will return
home to host their ﬁrst home match,
with Robert Morris College next
Wednesday.

The Sporting Life
Campanella reﬂects on racism, tribute at L.A. Coliseum

(Editor’s Note: This is the second
part of a two-part series on Roy
Campanella. )

By Bob Travers
Staff Writer

“Jackie Robinson was a tremendous
person,” Campanella told me. “He
had to be to accept the challenge Mr.
Rickey had for him. He was a terriﬁc
athlete at UCLA before he played pro-
fessional baseball, and he was a ﬁne
man off the ﬁeld as well.”

Racial hatred was always directed
more at Robinson than any other black
major leaguer. He was a symbol, but
the Deep South in the 1940s was not
the best of places for a black man to
be playing baseball. Racial attitudes in
the South had changed little in the 90
years since the Civil War, but it was
in the South that the Dodgers spent the
spring each year. '

After they left their training camp at
Vero Beach, Fla., the Dodgers barn-
stormed the South each March, play-
ing exhibitions in Alabama, Georgia,
Mississippi and Florida. And with
antebellum Dixie attitudes still ﬁrmly
entrenched, the South was a difﬁcult
place for a black player to perform.

“There was a lot of discrimination

in those days,” Campanella remem- '
bered. “We [black players] couldn‘t .

stay with the team in some hotels, we

couldn’t eat with the team in some A

restaurants, and sometimes we had to
dress in private homes because we
weren’t allowed to use the dressing
rooms. But that sort of thing was in
minor league cities, for the most part
in the Florida cities, but it did happen
in some major league cities.”

During games in those towns, black
players had to avoid not only head-high
inside fastballs from opposing pitchers,
but rocks, bottles, sticks, beer and
whatever else the crowd brought to hurl
at them. For these ﬁrst black players
who took the bulk of the abuse, revenge
was simply and unequivocably out of
the question. To avenge meant for a
black player to only strike back at
himself.

“Mr. O’Malley [Dodger owner
Walter O’Malley] called me and Jackie

’ into his ofﬁce one day and said he knew

we could play baseball, but we had to
prove that on the ﬁeld to everyone
else,” recalled Campanella. “He said
we would have to prove we could play
baseball and prove we were gentlemen
off the ﬁeld. We were watched more
closely because we stuck out more.”

Thirty years after his prime, Cam-
panella is remembered as being dif-

Roy Campanella

ferent. But it was not the color of his
skin that set him apart from most
ballplayers, it was instead his
magniﬁcence as a player that fans
remember most.

Campanella joined the Dodgers full-
time in 1948 and became Brooklyn’s
starting catcher a year later. It was a
position he would hold throughout his
baseball career, and the one he had

 even during his ﬁnal season in 1957.

In the course of those 10 years with
Brooklyn, Campanella won three Na-
tional League Most Valuable Player
Awards — one in 1951, his second in
1953 and his ﬁnal award in 1955. Of
those three seasons, it was 1953 which
was the most outstanding. In that sum-

mer Campanella set new records in two
categories — most home runs by a

catcher (41) and most RBIs for a catch-
er (l42). He hit a blistering .312 that
year.

And the Dodgers? Well, the Dodgers
won the National League pennant for
the second consecutive year, but again
in the Fall Classic they were beaten in
a seven-game series by the Yankees.

Indeed, it would be another two sum-
mers before the Dodgers would ﬁnal-
ly break the Yankee yoke on the World
Series. For in 1955, the Bums won a
World Series at last. It was Brooklyn’s
ﬁrst. Campanella hit .318 that magical
summer and belted 32 home runs.

January 1958 was a month quite
unkind to the Brooklyn Dodgers. It was
during that month Walter O’Malley an-
nounced he was moving his team to
Los Angeles. The Brooklyn Dodgers
were no more. On Jan. 26 of that year,
Roy Campanella’s car skidded on a
patch of ice on a slick Long Island road
and slammed into a telephone pole. His

baseball career ended instantly and at
the age of 36 Roy Campanella was
paralyzed from the neck down.

With the Dodgers settling into their
spacious new abode in the Los Angeles
Coliseum and the future as golden as
a Paciﬁc sunset, the team took one
night to look back and remember. On
May 7, 1959, a tribute was to be paid
Roy Campanella in the form of a
candlelight ceremony during a Dodger
game that night. It would be Cam-
panella’s ﬁrst public appearance in a
stadium since the accident.

“That night at the Coliseum is
something I’ll never forget,” Cam-
panella said. ‘ ‘They turned down all the
lights in the stadium in the ﬁfth inning.
Then everybody lit a candle or a match
or whatever they had. It was beautiful.
I will always remember that night.”

That night was more than a touching
tribute to a great man. It was an ending.
It was a beginning. For on that night,
the past, rooted deep in the asphalt of

. Brooklyn streets and the private

memories of a million baseball fans,
met the future head-on.

Ah, the future. Of days to come
ﬁlled with the promise of sweet sum-
mer nights in Chavez Ravine, Holly-
wood endings and Hollywood hopes.
That night, as always, as it should be,
the future won.

Still, they could not forget.

And as the golden lights of tribute,
like stars twinkled in the darkened
ballpark, it was time standing still. It
was a moment frozen. The faint wisp
of yesterdays remembered recaptured,
of faces again remembered. A million
memories for each light, a smile, a tear
and a word of thanks. One moment, the
past is lamented, relived and gone.

And a bequest in
your will is one of
the best. For full

Lady gymnasts reach new high

By Julia Stitely
Staff Writer

The Lady Panther gymnasts ﬁnally
put it all together Saturday afternoon
as they set a new school record of
183.8 and said goodbye to two seniors
and a head coach. Kristy Pieters and
Jackie Calderone were honored before
the competition and head coach Donna
Sanft after. Sanft, head coach for the
past 12 years, has already begun her
new job as coordinator of student af-
fairs for athletes. A tearful Pieters
representing the entire team concluded
Sanft’s last home meet by saying, “All
we want to say is goodbye, thanks and
we love you.”

Sanft surely loved them back after
their performance Saturday. From their
very first event, the Lady Panthers
looked hot. They set a new school
record of 46.15 on vault. The lowest
Pitt score on the event was a 9.0. Alisa
Spector, Trish Aser and Stephanie
Megill were the top vaulters in the
meet, scoring 9.35, 9.3 and 9.2
respectively.

The Kent State Lady Flashes and
Michigan Wolverines went nearly un-
noticed as the Lady Panthers stormed
through the rest of the competition.
Uneven bars was also a new school
record, 46.35, as Pitt registered only
one fall in nine routines. Beth Waters
had the high score of the entire meet,
9.6. to win bars. Spector was second
with a 9.3. Several Pitt gymnasts
scored personal bests. including Jackie
Calderone’s 9.1._ '

The balance beam was still not
mistake—free, but it was more so than
in recent meets. Out of eight routines.
the Lady Panthers suffered only three
falls. Aser and Kim Calderone were the
top Pitt performers as they hit routines
for 9.35 scores. Spector fell on a layout
back somersault to be Pitt’s next best
score, 8.95. Pieters allowed herself a
smile after a successful cartwheel to
back somersault but later came off the
beam after a tour jete leap.

Pieters redeemed herself and pol-
ished off her career at Trees Hall by
winning the ﬂoor exercise with her ren-
dition of “Raiders of the Lost Ark.”
Pieters beefed up her last tumbling
pass, successfully throwing a double
twisting somersault. She again hit her
piked double back somersault, a move
she has not missed in competition yet.

Right behind Pieters’ 9.35, was
teammate Aser with a 9.3 and her
always beautifully jazzy routine. Spec-

tor and Megill also hit double back
somersaults to score 9.25 and tie with '
Kent State’s Wendie Burrier for third.

Spector again won the all-around
competition. Her score of 36.85 should
keep her in contention for a berth to the
NCAA Championships. Pieters scored
36.6 to ﬁnish second. Michigan’s Heidi
Cohen was consistent throughout the
meet to score 36.3 and finish third. The
only other non-Pitt gymnast to place in
the meet was Kent State’s Alisa
Kovalick, who hit beam for a 9.45 and
a ﬁrst—place finish.

Michigan were brimming with difficul-
ty, often more so than Pitt’s, but their
routines were also riddled with falls.
Those costly falls kept their total scores
to 175.8 for Kent State and 174.6 for
Michigan. '

Sanft noted the few mistakes her
team made throughout the competition
but “I’m not complaining,” she said.
‘ ‘This was a real conﬁdence booster.’ ’
If the Lady Panthers can maintain their
momentum from Saturday, their 183.8
score may keep’ them competitive with
Penn State and Ohio State at regionals

Men’s gymnastics team crushed

By Julia Stitely
Staff Writer

Penn State showed why it is one of
the top gymnastics schools in the na-
tion Friday evening as the Nittany
Lions trounced a weakened Panther
team 274.80—253.65. Pitt competed
without injured all-arounder Jorge San-
chez. Unbelievably, Penn State was
also not at full strength Friday. Head
coach Karl Schier left part of his team
at home, saving them for next month’s
NCAA Championships. .

The loss was not unexpected for Pitt.
“We’ve never beaten them,” said Pitt
head coach Frank D’Amico. “I’m
emotionally drained. Even in the sum-
mer, I think of meeting Penn State, and
my palms start sweating.”

Penn State, ﬁelding gymnasts from
Great Britain, Denmark and Brazil,
won all six events handily. Nittany
Lions Marcelo Ribeiro and Ian Shel-
ley were the top all—around gymnasts
in the meet, scoring totals of 54.85 and
54.80 respectively. Pitt’s Mark Klafter
was right behind with a 54.45.

Klafter did manage to break the Lion

domination by taking two ﬁrst places, ~

the only Pitt gymnast to do so Friday.
He won the parallel bars outright with
a score of 9.3 and tied Lion Tony Grif-
ﬁths on the horizontal bar with a 9.4.

Floor exercise and vault were Pitt’s
best events as usual, even though all
of Penn State’s vaulters scored better
than the Panthers. Senior Matt Peters
had the top score for Pitt, a 9.1 piked
Tsukahara. Penn State’s lowest score
was a 9.15. The winner of the event,
Shelley, scored a 9.45 for a soaring
fuIl—twisting handspring done from on-
ly one arm. His teammates, Chris Laux
and Jan Olsen, were second and third
with 9.4 and 9.3.

Had Sanchez been healthy, he may
have been able to break into the top
three places on vault. He was also
missed on the ﬂoor exercise, his best
event. Pitt had their highest event total
of the meet on floor nonetheless.
Klafter scored 9.5 to ﬁnish third. Lions
Ribeiro and Mike Ambrozy scored
9.65 and 9.55 for the top two spots.
Ribeiro packed the most difficulty of
any gymnast into his routine, throwing
a full—twisting double back somersault
and a double—twisting layout somersault
and ending with a tucked double back.
If this reporter counted fast enough,
fourth—place finisher Glenn Aser of
Penn State performed the only triple»
twisting somersault of the meet.

Klafter and Ben Rovee went second

and fourth on the still rings for Pitt-

while Mike Mealie was fourth on the
pommel horse. Shelley had the highest
score of the competition on pommel
horse, a 9.8, for a nearly perfect
routine. Pitt’s lack of depth was most
evident on the pommel horse, as San-
chez could not adequately be replaced.

Depth has been a problem for Pitt on
high bar all season, and Friday was no
exception. Klafter was strong for Pitt,
but the rest of the scores trailed off
from there. Peters scored an 8.6 for a

rolms on the hih bar continued to plague the

Panthers against Penn State.

routine which included a fall on his
one-arm giant swing to Gienger somer-
sault. The other Pitt scores were in the
sevens.

Penn State also had a tough time on
high bar, although they still managed

a'44.6 total. Shelley fell on his Tkat—
Chev, a backwards ﬂight over the bar,

and Ambrozy put his hands down on
his double layout somersault dismount.

The Lions also had to count an 8.15 as
Phil Mitchell fell.

D’Amico was not displeased with his
team’s performance as they ﬁnished the
season with a l0—6 record and a top 20
national ranking. “Our score was bet-
ter than I expected,” D’Amico said.
“If somebody gets hurt, we don’t have
20 people [to replace them}. We need
to rebuild.”

Pitt said goodbye to its top two gym-
nasts, senior co-captains Matt Peters
and Mark Klafter. Both have repre-

 

ack of depth on the poel or was oe a I

sented Pitt at the NCAA Champion-

I ships in their four years here. It looks

as though Klafter will again represent
Pitt at the NCAAS next month, al-
though it is “not statistically official”
yet, according to Klafter. Peters felt he
had an outside chance of being picked
again but noted that it would be
“something extra,” not a necessary
ending to a good season.

Klafter plans to remain in gymnastics
competitively for six more months.
“This summer, I’m going for the
U.S.G.F. [United States Gymnastics
Federation] Nationals after the
NCAAs. I’d like to do some interna-
tional competing, just to enjoy gym-

nastics going out.” After that, Klafter

plans to attend medical school. Peters
will be working on his master’s degree
in business administration and hopes to
return his expertise to the Panther team
next year in the form of coaching.

Basketball recruiting year respectable

By John Enright
Staff Writer

Former head coach Roy Chipman
left Pitt amidst numerous criticisms
about his coaching ability. But no one
could doubt his ability to recruit top-
notch players. Chipman was able to
land such reputable high school stars
as Clyde Vaughan, Curtis Aiken,
Charles Smith, Demetreus Gore and
Jerome Lane.

And once again Chipman did a fine
job last fall, signing three quality
players in November. The signees in-
clude Rodney Brookin, a 6-5 small for-
ward from Steelton-Highspire High
School in Steelton, Pa. , Herb Barthol,
a 6-11 center from Normandy High
School in Parma, Ohio, and John
McNeil, a 6-3 guard from Fike High

School in Wilson. N.C.

Although many recruiting magazines
list all three players among the top 100
high school players in the nation. none
of the three are close to “Parade All-
America" status. This isn't surprising.
though, for two reasons.

The first reason is that Chipman had
a tougher time recruiting last fall
because of the talent Pitt already has,
so he could no longer offer a recruit
the opportunity to start as a freshman.
Chipman would disagree, but when
you don't have a possible starting spot
open for a frosh, it’s much more dif-
ficult to sign high school All-Americas.

Secondly, the Doug West incident
hurt Pitt's recruiting efforts tremen-
dously. West, a freshman at Villanova,
accused a Pitt alumnus of offering him
$10,000 cash to sign with the Panthers.
Consequently, the “Parade All-

Americas" Pitt was recruiting backed
off. and eventually signed with other
schools. I‘d rather not mention names.
but I can think of two “Parade All-
Americas" the Panthers probably
would have signed if West never made
his accusation.

But that’s all in the past. So let’s hope
for the best for Pitt’s three incoming
freshmen instead of worrying about
what could have been.

Brookin is the best player in the
group and will probably see some time
next season at small forward, backing
up Gore or Lane. Brookin, who led his
team to a 17-8 record this past season,
averaged 31.3 points per game on the
year. He concluded his four—year
career at Steelton as the school’s all-
time leading scorer with 2,409 points.

High School News Magazine calls
Brookin “a big-time swingman with an

effective. medium—range shot. He is a
great competitor.“

If Pitt has a weakness. it is at the
center position. I can't remember the
last time the Panthers had a legitimate
threat at that position. Next season.
6-7‘/2 Tico Cooper will be Pitt’s most
experienced returning center.

If Cooper doesn't come through,
hopefully Barthol can do an adequate
job as a freshman. Barthol's high scool
coach Rich Elderrnire is optimistic. “I
hope he can. He’s a big, strong kid,
and he has won several games for us
this season. He has been the most
valuable player in our league.” For the
season, Barthol averaged 19.8 ppg,
10.5 rebounds per game and 4.5 blocks
per game.

The third Pitt recruit, John McNeil,
is an enigma. After his junior season,
High School News listed him as the

sixth best junior player on the East ‘

Coast. but this season McNeil‘s stockﬁ
has gone down considerably. Still, he
is definitely a talented player. "Incredi-
ble athletic ability  [he] has been
described as a smaller Michael Jor-
dan." said High School News.
“Though more of a swingman now, he
could possibly become a point guard
in college.”

All in all it was a solid recruiting
class for a young team that no longer
needs starters but capable reserves.
Brookin is the most talented of the three

players, but Barthol should have th§ 0

best opportunity to start because of
Pitt’s lack of talent at the center
position.

Pitt still has three remaining scholar-
ships left, but they will be lucky to sign
even one more player if they don’t
name a new head coach soon.

I graduated from the Univ. of Pgh, and
was unemployed for over a year when
I said enough with the Pgh. job market.
Last year at age 24, I relocated to Los
Angeles on a hunch and some new job
hunting ideas. I landed a $30,000/yr
non—tech job in 2 weeks. My brother
followed and changed from social
worker to aerospace buyer in 10 weeks
with a $10,000 salary increase. The job
market is booming if you know how to
approach it. Jobs are available at all
levels. Take the steps to improve your life
