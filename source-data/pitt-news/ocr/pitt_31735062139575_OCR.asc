As a special feature W. W’. Men-
(lenhall, executive secretary of the
YMCA, has arranged for the appear-
ance of the Jubilee Singers, a negro
choral group, well-known for its in-
terpretations of folk music. This
group has appeared before at Uni-

ous members of the faculty to act as
“foster fathers” for the evening.

Druids Approve
New Constitution

Fraternity To Include 18 Members
Instead Of Present 15

Pursuing the purpose of “making
Druids really an honorary sophomore
activities fraternity,” the member-
ship of that organization met 'l‘hurs-
day night and voted a complete re-
vision of its constitution—a con-
stitution which has been revised
practically every year lately.

Changes in the quota. of men elect-
ed, changes in election procedure,
changes in the make-up of the organ-
ization itself, and revisions to pave
the way for making the new consti-
tution a permanent one were decided
upon.

The most signiﬁcant features of the
new constitution include:

1. Expanding the fraternity to 18
instead of the usual 15 members. 2.
Electing only two off-semester men
each year. 3. Demanding satisfac-
tory reasons from members for black-
balling nominees. 4. -Calling for a
two-thirds, instead of majority vote,
in electing new members. 5. Requir-
ing a three—fourths, instead of two-
thirds vote, to amend the constitution.

It has been the opinion of Druids,
according to Ernest Rose, C, presi-
dent, that many good men have been
overlooked by the organization each
year—hence the expanding‘ of mem-
bership.

For the ﬁrst time, provision has
been made for blackballs. In the
past, straight majority approval has
been sufficient to elect a man into
the fraternity. Three blackballs.
now, will be sufficient to keep a man
out, although if the full quota of men
has not been duly elected. those with
two-thirds of the members’ votes, but
with three opposing blackballs, will
be reconsidered, providing sound and
satisfactory reasons cannot be giver:
for the blackballs. ,

Cap And Gown Chorines To Swing
Into Dance Routines On February 25

 

Interest in Cap and Gown, all-men’s
campus activity, has again been re-
vived with the announcement of the
appointment of Theodore Viehman as
director of the spring show.

The marquee of the Nixon theater
will advertise “Cap and Gown, of the
University of Pittsburgh, presents” to
ﬁrst-nighters the evening of April 22.
Tentative plans have been made with
the Allegheny County Civic Club to
sponsor the opening performance.

Starting on February 25, the date
set for tryouts, undergraduates will
again slip into sweat pants and com-

, fortable shoes and kick their “dainty

ankles.”

Cap and Gown, in its 27 years of
existence, cannot boast of supplying
alluring ingenues, but many former
members have gone ahead to shine
in the national spotlight. Others are
prominent local ﬁgures.

Regis Toomey, '21, star of the shows
“M,y Diamond Girl” and “Done and
Undone,” perhaps deserves the most
acclaim. Toomey graduated from the
School of Economics (now the School
of Business Administration).

In New York he obtained a role

understudying the male lead in the
“Rose Marie” company. Following this
he took a' job with a prominent stock

company, which left for England,
where he barnstormed for four
months.

Returning to New York, Regis ap-
plied to David Belasco, famous stage
impresario, who was sufficiently in-
terested in Toomey to get him a
break in Hollywood. Lately he starred
in the recent movie hits “Twenty-
four Hours” and “Touchdown.”

Another former Cap and Gowner
worthy of mention is Woodman
Thompson, ’24, appearing in the show,
“Leave it to Marian," who is now
prominent as a scenic designer on
Broadway, _

Harry Bates, ’33, is doing free lance
work as a director in and about the
city; Dr. J. -C. MacBurney, ’27, is
prominent as a solost on a national
hook-up; Dr. Clarence W. Sober, '32.
is playing drama at the Civic theatre
in Philadelphia; Eugene Kelly, '33,
has a dancing school in Johnstown;
and William Pillich, special student
who starred in “All to the Point," in-
structs dancing classes downtown.

Prom Promises
Gorgeous Queen,
Fine Orchestra

In Addition, Lowest Price In
History Makes Traditional
Affair A Paragon

The junior women of the University
won't be represented in the front

line of the traditional grand march
at the Junior Prom Friday night. Jo-
seph L. Rodgers, BA, chairman, has
selected a senior, Marion Epping, BA,
to be queen of the annual formal
function.

Miss Epping. the only woman now

in the SEA general assembly to have
been a member of Student Council, is
also a member of Mortar Board, wo-
men’s national honorary senior activ-
ities fraternity, and a member of
Theta Phi Alpha. Rodgers is a mem-
ber of Phi Kappa, was a Druid, and
is assistant football manager and a
member of SFA.
. The grand march will begin about
11 o’clock in the main ballroom of
the VVilliam Penn hotel, where Tom-
mie Christian’s NBC broadcasting or-
chestra will play.

Sub-committee chairmen, who have
been making ﬁnal plans for the dance
under Rodgers’ supervision, include:
Charles Allcroft, C, publicity; Stew-
art McAwley, BA, decorations; Rob-
bert Mease, E, programs; and Louise
Kelly, guests.

~Christian’s orchestra, famous
through the Chicago and west coast
district, comes here from the Trianon
ballroom in the windy city. Originally
a member of the Mason-Dixon ﬁve,._a.
unit which included Ted Weems and
his brother Art, Jack Crawford
(known various places as the -Crown
Prince of Jazz), Christian is consider-
ed one of the ﬁnest saxophonists in
circulation. Blanche Rochelle and
the Three Jackets, a male trio, will
also entertain Prom patrons.

Tickets, at $3 per couple, the lowest
price in modern Prom history, will be
on sale until 5 o’clock Friday with
members of the committee, in the of-
ﬁce of the dean of men, Room 801,
Cathedral. and with VVilliam -Daufen-
bach in Alumni hall. An attendance
of about 300 couples is anticipated.-

Second Edition
Of Denial Rays

Appears Today .

The second issue of Dental Rays,
official student and alumni publica-
tion of the School of Dentistry, will
make its appearance on the campus
today.

Two articles, one by H, M. Vernon,
a Pittsburgh metallurgist, and an-
other by George Liddell, D35, are fea-
tured in this issue. Mr. Vernon in
his article, entitled, “Certain physical
tests,” discusses the speciﬁcations
that dental golds must possess. Lid-
dell’s article is on a phase of Ortho-
dontia, “Sp-ace Retainers.”

This issue also contains a message ,

on the responsibilities of dentists by
Dr. E. G. Meisel, professor of clinical
dental pathology and radiology in the
School of Dentistry and a trustee of
the American Dental Association; and
abstracts on various phases of den-
tistry by a group of prominent Pitts-
burgh dentists, Drs_ L. E. Van Kirk,
M. E_ Nicholson, and .-H. A. Anderson

In an editorial appearing in this
issue, a survey and analysis of all the
editorials appearing in the -journal of
the American Dental Association for
the last three years is made and cer-
tain recommendations are advanced
with a view to improving the national
journal.

Two regular features, the student
section and the alumni section, also
appear. ‘

Copies of this new issue will be
distributed among 3,000 students and
alumni of the School of Dentistry.

while actually in school.

Journalists Maul
Dr. Tippetts, Try
To Extract Cash

New Dean Learns Of Biographical
Incident, Repulses Old
Publicity Racket

Dean Tippetts believes that Pitts-
burgh journalism has its darker side,
to say the least.

The man who came to the School
of Business Administration from the
University of Buffalo last week is

still wondering. for instance, how a '

Pittsburgh imitator of Time maga-
zine could have gotten the exciting
1)iograpl1ica.l
about him.
The news magazine reported a cere-
mony in Dean Tippett’s life which the
dean could not remember, describing
the presentation to him of a book of

clippings by The Buffalo Times pur- ,,

porting to show a newspaper reputa-
tion for the supression of academic

freedom at the University of Pitts- '

burgh. According to the magazine,
the purpose of the book of clippings
was to induce the popular dean of
commerce to stay in Buffalo; and still
according to the magazine, Dean Tip-
pets refused to cancel his plans, after
a thorough investigation of his own.

“To my knowledge there isn’t such
a book,” Dr. Tippetts boomed. “I
never saw it (with a jovial accent on
the ‘I’) nor heard of it.”

Earlier last week the dean was the
intended object of a newspaper rack-
et that has become familiar to faculty
members here. Importuned for the
story of his life by a reporter from a
small-circulation neighborhood paper,
Dean Tippetts ﬁrst refused the offer
of a special eulogistic editorial and
then warded off demands for “some-
thing for the editor.”

“He said it was customary for
friends of the editor to contribute
$25,” the dean explained, “but he
made me successive special offers of
$20, $15, $10 and .$5. Apparently the
editor’s dignity prevented him from
accepting less than $5, even from a
special friend.”

Although Dr. Tippetts will not have
the gratiﬁcation of a. special editorial
in the neighborhood paper. he will
have the sympathy of many members
of the faculty who had the same ex-
perience on moving here, according
to Dr. Robert Hance, head of the de-
partment of zoology.

‘Dean Tippetts comes to the Univer-
sity by way of Princeton and Iowa
universities, as well as Buffalo, hav-
ing commenced his teaching career
at the New Jersey school the day
after his discharge from the army,
following 16 months overseas. He
has been voted “most popular instruc-
tor” in the schools in which he has
served.

YMCA Institute
Opens Wednesday

 

Life Perspectives To Be Theme
Of Dr. Hough’s Discussion

The three day Institute on Reli-
gion, featuring Dr. Lynn I-Iarolcl
‘I-Iough, dean of the Drew Theological
seminary, will open VVednesday at

12:30 o’clock at Heinz House.

Dr. I-Iough will attempt, through a
series of assemblies and conferences,
to present a life perspective to col-
lege students. The Institute is to be
sponsored jointly by the campus, YM
and YVVCA organizations.

Group meetings open to the cam-
pus at large will be held at Heinz
House at 12:30 o’clock and again at
3:30 o’clock on Wednesday, and again
at noon on Thursday.

A special feature of the Institute
is to be a mother-daughter tea at
Heinz House on Thursday afternoon
at 3:30 o'clock.

This tea, which will replace the
mother-daughter banquet originally
scheduled for Thursday evening, will
be the first YVV-sponsored tea to
which mothers have been invited. A
general invitation has been extended
to all undergraduate women students
and their mothers. Dr. -Hcugh will
speak to the group.

Students who participate in the Re-
ligious Institute will attend the com-
mencement exercises in Memorial hall
at 10:30 o’clock Friday morning.

New Enameling Process
Perfected At Institute

The development of a new process
for the application of porcelain enam-
els is the newest contribution of the
Mellon Institute to manufacturing ef-
ﬁciency, according to an announce-
ment today by Dr. Edward R. Weid-
lein, director.

Manufacturers of electric refrigera-
tors, washing machines, cooking
stoves, kitchen ware and similar
products, will be able to effect im-
portant economies in production, and
at the same time produce a better
product, it is claimed.

The chief advantage of the process
is that it requires only one or two
coatings and ﬁrings of enamel in place
of the two or three that are necessary
under present methods. This will
eliminate the material, fuel and the
labor costs of one ﬁring, and the
number of rejected units will be re-
duced.

The process was developed through
the joint efforts of Dr. J. E. Rosen-
berg and William J. Baldwin.

Spoon Tradition
May Be Revived
In Tap Exercises

Proportional Representation For
Women To Be Urged By
Constitutions Body

Students May Attend

Final decision on the proposed
campus newsreel theater will be
made at the monthly Student
Faculty Association meeting to-
morrow evening iii the Hotel
Schenley. The session, again open
to the general student body, will
be held in the old Faculty club rooms,
and is scheduled for 7:30 o’clock.

According to Leonard Marks, C35,
president of the SFA Executive com-
mittee, a complete report on the proj-
ect will be presented by representa-
tives of a committee which attended a
special preview downtown on Thurs-
day.

The assembly, it is said, will vote
of weekly pro-
grams, each about one hour in length,
at a nearby theater. Five showings
of travel, news and educational ﬁlms
would be held from 10:30 on Wednes-
day mornings until 3:30 o’clock. A
screening committee would select the
program. Admission will likely be
ten cents.

Spoon Tradition Continued

Beginning on activities tap day in
May, the assembly will be informed,
a. rejuvenated Senior Spoon tradition
The 64-year old
custom, which has lapsed ten times,
has been reintroduced after each pe-
riod. For the past several years, the
spoon has been annually presented
to a junior during the Spring Festival
dance. Jules Green, C35, received it
in 1934.

The spoon will now be given to
the most representative junior, se-
lected by the lilxecutive committee,
if the committee plans are approved.
The student chosen, it is explained,
will receive the highest all-University
honor open to members of his class.

Reports of the Constitutions com-
mittee, advocating proportional rep-
resentation of women, will also fea-
ture the meeting. The body has al-
ready presented its suggestions to
the Executive group of SFA; assem-
bly approval of the recommendations
is expected.

Women Represented

University women would have ten
representatives in the assembly and
two in the Executive committee un-
der the suggested rules. Student
membership in the Executive organi-
zatiou would be increased from ﬁve
to six, and the election procedure
would be clariﬁed.

Members will hear reports of the
intra-mural athletics program, the
high school interscholastics, the new
SFA-VVSGA book exchange, and the
speak:-31‘s’ extension bureau. Revision
of point—scale ratings, methods of ad-
mitting new organizations to the cam-
pus, and the soon-to-be-opened mixed
lounge will also be discussed.

 

 

Students’ Theses Appear

An early issue of “Heating, Piping,
and Air Conditioning,” the official
publication of the Society of Heat-
ing and Ventilating Engineers, will
contain two theses by students in the
department of mechanical engineer-
ing. Albert \Vahl, a graduate stu-
dent and J. E. Helquist, E35, are the
authors. Both wrote their papers un-
der F. C. Houghton, director of the
society's research laboratory.

Course in Strike

Strategy At Meeting With Miners

“What the miners need is a good
course in strike strategy,” said Ho-
mer C. W’adsworth, C35, at a panel
discussion meeting of mine owners.
townspeople, and college students in
Neffs, Ohio, last week.

Coming in answer to an operator’s
advice to the miners “to become
Americanized so that you can get old

age pensions,” the speaker’s words
aroused no small furore.
The suggestion of the course in

“strike strategy,” came during the
course of Wadsworth’s proposal for :1
program of “adult education” for the
miners. He proposed that a school be
started at which the miners would
not only learn the best methods of
collective bargaining with a view to
the betterment of their condition, but
also to study the present setup of the
American Federation of Labor and
the United Mine Workers. Courses in
home economics and kindred subjects
should also be taught, he maintained.

A mine operator, who spoke imme-
diately following Wadsworth, charged
that such a program would under-

mine the industry and would bring on
a series of strikes.

Roger Hanson, C36, reported that if
miners knew how to conduct a strike
successfully there would be less long-
drawn out, bloody strikes.

Vvadsworth and Hanson were two
of ﬁve University students who made
the trip to Neffs in order to study
mining conditions at ﬁrst hand. In
the group also were Ed Lincoln, C36;

Betty Devlin, E‘d35; and Alice Crutch-
ﬁeld, C36.
Besides the school for miners,

I-Vadsworth advocated a closer tie-up
between the cooperative store and the
union. Under the present system the
union miners have refrained from
joining the cooperative because they

could not get credit in time of streets;

Upon investigation into the books of
the cooperative it was found that a
total of $66,000 had been paid as divi-
dends during the last 20 years. “Some
way to include the union miners in

the cooperative by establishing other"

credit facilities
Wadsworth said.

To Freshmen, Sophomores

And Juniors-u

N SCARCELY MORE than a few weeks, students will vote in
campus-wide elections to name 30 upperclassmcn to seats in the

University Assembly.

The University ‘Assembly is the governing body of the whole
student association —~ called the Student.-Faculty Association —-to

which every regist.cred student belongs.

Fifteen juniors, 15 se-

niors and 10 faculty members make up the University Assembly.

Student members are elected in May for terms of one year.

Fac-

ulty members arc appointed by Chancellor Bown1a.n.

The duties of the University Assembly are not explicit, but
it seems to have legislative power over student activities, “inso-
far as such powers do not conﬂict with the authority of the faculty
as deﬁned by the Board of Trustees.”

Some of the measures the University Assembly has considered
so far this year are: appointment of dance chairmen; celebration
of football victories; revision of rules for social affairs; arrange-
ment for a series of 25-cent afternoon dances; revision of its own

by-laws; intramural basketball;
reel possibilities and the censure of one of its members.

investigation of campus news-
Other

subjects it might well discuss are student living‘ quarters, campus

We View With Alarm

(From the Daily Californian)
Through the ranks of publications men and women yesterday morning
ran a. shiver of apprehension. “The Pelican,” grand old bird of the campus
and first ranking collegiate humor publication in the United States, is to

have an “advisory” board appointed by the A.S.U.C.

each issuerof the magazine.
VVe view with alarm.

President to review

By the same token, the “.VIona1-ch of the Col-

lege Dailies” could be given an “advisory” board to peer over its editor’s

shoulder and “advise” concerning his editorial opinion.

could be appointed to “advise” the

Another ' board
managing editor as to which news

events should be printed. Even The Californian could be given a. board

to “advise” him concerning handling of satire.

‘We view with alarm.

Now we are not saying that President Alden Smith would do this.

Vvo are not saying that any A.S.U.C. President would do this.

But a pre-

cedent has been established, if this action remains effective, that would
open publications to the possibility of censorship.

Advice is good. VVe seek it daily; the editor of “The Pelican” seeks it
before each issue is published. But the editor of each publiactiou should
seek it for himself; it should not be forced on him by an A.S.U.C. Presi-

dent's “advisory” board.

It has long been the rule that the editor of each publication at the

University is solely responsible for his publication.

If his conduct is not

satisfactory, he can be removed by the Executive Committee, or censured
by the President of the University upon recommendation of the Student

Affairs Committee.

Such censure can deny him the right of participation

in student activities, or result in his suspension or expulsion from the

University.

All publications are satisﬁed with this rule.

If it could be shown that

an editor was guilty of misconduct of his publication, and that the situa-

tion warranted it, they would agree to his removal from his position.

We

believe that this ruling is sufﬁcient to handle all cases.

Therefore we oppose any “advisory” board for “The Pelican.” Surely
it can be seen that even a board so appointed as the present, without any
enforcement teeth, stands an excellent chance of developing into a deﬁnite-

ly censoring body.

Phases Of Technical Revolt In Art

 

By Herrymon Maurer

As I walked through the galleries in
;which are hung the paintings of prize
Ewinners in the Carnegie International
isince 1897, I found myself mentally
?dividing ~— should I say damning —-
jthe artists into two classes, the Mod-
lerns and the Ancients. Not that the
§Ancients are old from point of view
of time; some of them are still paint-
ing. But ﬁfteen or twenty years ago
painting took stock of itself and de-
cided to cast aside the camera and
take. up the brush.

This revolution was entirely tech-
§IJiC9.l. You will ﬁnd few paintings
in the current exhibition which trans-
mit any emotion other than admira-
tion for skill i11 managing pigment.
Art now, just as art then, announces
its contentment with itself. Now, how-
ever, it is more frankly art-for-art’s
sake, for the Ancients tried to ex-
‘cuse themselves by using man as a

esubject for still life, while the Mod-
erns paint ﬂowers and apples and
compose in their spare time speeches
on the Esthetic Emotion — speeches
which are to persuade the vast un-
lcultured public that they are wrong
sin asking for any sort of feeling in a
painting (for paintings of such a
nature are concerned with illustra-
tion) and that they should seek the
’r.rue excellences which appeal to the
Esthetic Emotion.

When Art Is Art

Strange it is that in ages when art.
fulﬁlls a social function, it is itself
a craft, while in ages when it is far
removed from life it calls itself Art.

So don’t go to the exhibition of In-
ternational winners hoping to be in-
fected by the feeling of the paintings.
for only a few artists are concerned
with emotional values. Go rather with
an interest‘ iii the history of the
change of technique, and you will
leave wondering that so great a
furore can be raised over objects of
so little value. But the exhibition is
there. Vvhether you go to damn art
for being so far removed from the
realities of existence, whether you go
with a fondness for technical history
or whether you go with feelings both
of damnation and admiration, it has
its appeal.

The older paintings are cluttered
and heavy and photographic. Back-
grounds and foregrounds are ﬁlled
with scissors or vases or tables or
pictures. Objects have been poured
in, poure-:l in so copiously that the
eye is distractecl and skips hit or
miss over the paints, ﬁnding neither
interest nor design. The style is
not solid; it is ponderous, not only
in quantity of objects but in brush-
work. Even in the better-than-most
paintings of Dauchez, the canvas is
,littered. VV'hile parts of his two
‘works, Boats and The Kelp Gath-
erers have sound design and vital
line, the concession which he makes
to the style of his times hinders'en-
joyment.

There was, however, a rebel ten-
deucy. The two paintings of Childc
Hassam, whatever may be their ab-
solute merit, in their warmth and
brilliance of color, are a relief from
the dull, dark and inexpressive enor-
mities which have been ca1led\art.

But even in those times, which we
are accustomed to consider without
hope of salvation, some effective work
was produced. Thomas Eakins painted
a portrait of a professor. He worked
with the stylistic limitations of his
time, he tried nothing new. The face,
the clothes of the professor are
painted with camera-like exactitude;
yet there is a. spirit pervading the
whole painting.‘ The professor is 
real individual, not in ‘color or com-
plexion or in appearance of gar-
ments; he is an individual with
thoughts and feelings and character.
We know him and understand him.

So it is with George Bellows’ paint-
ing, Eleanor, Jean and Anna. Here

Ancients Doomed

But the Ancients with their heavy
literalness and their atmospheres of
mist, of moonliglit, of Venice are
doomed, and today we are forced to
contend with the l\lode.rns who are
more ﬁerce enemies, since they re-
sort to words, being unable to ﬁght
with paint, to expose our ignorance.
Certainly the eye is less disturbed in
that section of the exhibit in which
are rungethe works of later artists.
Here the colors are warm, the design
simple and straightforward. Even in
purely technical exercises such as
I-Ienry Varnuin Poor’s March Sun or
Speiche1"s Girl With Green Hat. there
is color and treatment which does not
leave a negative impression. In Ca.-
re11o.’s The Studio tlierc. is an insist-
ence o11 design and grouping of 
ures. These qualities are not to be
admired of themselves. for they con-
stitute the technical basis which we
have a right to expect. Technique for
the sake of technique is neither ex-
citing nor moving.

VVhen, however, we ﬁnd a painter
who considers his art as a. vehicle
for the transmission of emotion and
paints his reactions to the world he
knows, we realize our debt to the
Modems. The debt is real. The sim-
plicity and color and design upon
which they have insisted are, when
used to no purpose, tiring; but they
afford possibilities of a more com-
plete and more uniﬁed expression. We
realize our debt when we see such
paintings as Anto-Carte’s Motherhood,
which fortunately is in the permanent
collection, and John Stuart Curi-y’s
Tornado. While the latter is more
representational than the former, the
debt for ﬂuid technique of these
painters to the Moderns is obvious.
Perhaps the union of technique and
feeling has been in neither of these
two paintings completely achieved;
but the attempt has been made, and
our enjoyment of the exhibition is
heightened because of it.

lndignation was aroused last fall by
Peter Blu1ne’s South of Scranton.
Just as much there must have been in

the 1920’s when Davies’ picture,
After Thought of Earth, took first
prize. The person who can decide

what the paiiiting means, or whether
there is a meaning, should be awarded

Banks Praises

HolIywood’s Idea
Of ‘Copperfield’

By Edwin Banks
Although the moving picture ver-
sion of Dickens’ “David Copperﬁeld"

_ _ , _ _ ?has already had its initial showing in
dlSDOS€d of with an inclusive gener-:

Pittsburgh for a. week or so past, the
ﬁlm is important enough to receive
 belated comment. It is a picture
which should be seen and talked
about.

If I remember correctly the 1'hap-
sodical praise of Harold Cohen, the
local movie critic with discriminating
taste, he described “David Copper-
ﬁeld" as the perfect motion picture.

,\Vl1lle I was not quite so enrapturcd

as Mr. Cohen, I am inclined to be-
lieve that the ﬁlm was, within its in-
evitable l.imitat.ions, as great as the
novel itself. Surely, Dickens himself.
if he were alive today, could hardly
fail to say that his cha1'acte1‘s and
his caricatures came to life just
about as he originally created them
in his amazingly fertile imagination.

In fact the movie had the same ﬁne
qualities and the same shortcomings
as the novel. David as a boy, played
magniﬁcently by that brilliant little
Britsher, Freddie Bartholomen, was
the intelligent, sensitive, pathetic
child that Dickens made him in the
story. David as a young man, played
almost as well by Frank Lawton, was
also true to book cliaracter; emotional
and somewhat feminine i11 tempera-
ment. Dickens created David in what
he considered his own image, and
this personality is real and convinc-
ing.

The other characters in the movie,
with the probable exception of Peg-
goty, were either types or caricatures.
In this respect, too, the ﬁlm was
merely being faithful to the novel. for
Dickens’ work teems with the iden-
tical types and caricatures.

That good old trouper, Lionel Bar-
rymore, made Uncle Dan seem fairly
real, and the English actor who
played the role of Steerforth, did a
splendid job of turning that rather
stagey book ﬁgure into a human be-
ing. VV. C. Field, of course, merely
had to be his side-splitting self to be
‘Micawber, and he managed to he
himself very well.

Edna May Oliver was an enjoyable,
lovable, masculine old maid as Aunt
Betsey, and Elizabeth was satisfyiiig
as the beautiful but bewildered
mother of Copperﬁeld. But Murdstone,
Uriah Heep and Mr. Dick were all
one or two trait exaggerations. True
enough, they were entertaining, Mr.
Dick and his wickedly rolling eye
especially, but they were essentially
comic strip characters; human, per-
haps for r.:-ellerdraimner audiences,
but hardly for sophisticates—such as
college students. To the credit of
the actors it niust be said that they
were all Dickens could have asked
for.

Having read the novel beforehand.
I cannot guarantee the accuracy of

this observation, but it seemed to
me that people who were already
f3llllllEli' with the book probably eu-
joycd the movie much more than
those who knew little or nothing of
the story.

The directors of the motion pic-
ture undoubtedly made a. ,".'a1ianL
effort. to reproduce the important ep-
isodes o';' the narrative. That task
was an unusuallv difficult one be-
cause the story takes up 800 or more
pages in a standard edition. As ll‘,
ran it was an exceptionally long on-“
for 21 screen production. but even so
it was forced to touch only lightly on
several signiﬁcant sceiacs in the book.
to barely suggest others, and to skip
others altogether.

Hence it was my impression that
many episodes in the picture, which
could stir up recollections in a spec-
tator vho had read the novel and so
llriﬂg him .1 wealth of signiﬁcance.
probably puzzled a lot of people and
left them with a confused idea of tho
contiu-.ii1‘._v of the plot. The latter
class must have laughed heartily at
Micawber and his elegant English and
sighed over Steerforlh‘s masculino
charm, but I doubt whether they “got
the drift" of all the action through.

Hats off to Hollywood by all means,
however. The movie industry now-
adays can certainly produce splendid
efforts when it has a. mind to. If there
is still a mess of garbage being shov-
elled out of the coast every day.
there is plenty of screen entertain-
ment of the highest order.

The scoffer who wants demonstrable
proof that the movies have markedlv
matured in the last decade or two
should see one of those ﬂashback

shorts of thrilling ﬁlms when the
screen industry was in the bud. It
seems incredible to us today that

Mary Pickford, for example, could
have been idolized as she was for
her ludicrous performances in her
little Annie Rooney days. Even the
stupidest dumbbell at a. show house
grasps the fact that the old heart
rending tragedies are really uncon-
sciously mirthful. The movies have
grown up and are growing yet.

Roderick Sinks Field

Goal In Last Minute

To Give Carlsonmen 35-34 Victory

 

By Charles A. Ruch
The great. Duquesne band wagon suflfered a breakdown Friday
night at the Stadium pavilion, causing any number of predictors,
downtown sports writ'ers, a11d unattached partisans more than a

little bewilderment.

house, many of wl1o1n found it a bother to obey tl1e

A crowd of almost ﬁve thousand jammed the

(5

No Smoking”

signs and as a result tl1o last stages of the game were played in a

setting that resembled a London fog.

\Vhen the ﬁnal gun failed to

go off to end the affair, the scoreboard¢

read 35 pointsfor the Pitt Panthers
and 34 for the Dukes..

As the game went into the ﬁnal
two minutes, the Dukes appeared to
have met successfully their 25th
straight. test and the betting boys of
Bluffite allegiance were already plan-
ning how to spend the fruits of vic-
tory. Duquesne was leading, 34-31,
and two of the Pitt regulars, Skip
Hughes and Ross Emrick, had left
the game after committing four per-
sonal fouls.

Right then and there big Pete
Noon took control of a jump ball and
smacked it down to Bill Jesko, who
was cutting under the basket. and Mr.
Jesko ‘dropped it in to make the count
34-33. That one point still looked:
like a million when the Dukes got
control of the ball with but a minute
to go. But they lost it out of bounds
and Ralph Ferguson, in for Emrick,
peered through the fog a.nd saw Ted
Roderick silently waiting under the
basket. Ferguson threw the perfect
pass, Roderick banked in the perfect
ﬁeld goal, and that was the end of
the wonderful ﬁve-hoss shay that was
Duquesne.

Dukes Put Up Real Battle

Captain Paul Birch appeared destin-
ed to drive his team throu.2‘h safely
and had they not encountered the dan-
gerous. Ferguson-to-Roderick pass the
journey might have gone off without
disaster. The Dukes were making
them good from far out all evening
and played the same classy brand
of ball which enabled them to ride
over all that has come in their path
this year. The few seconds remain-
ing in the game after Roderick’s shot
were the only tough ones for Du-
ouesne. the Bluff boys appearing to
get a little too bewildered to accom-
plish anything at the sudden turn of
affairs.

It is mighty hard to censure a ball
club which has just knocked off the
outﬁt that people were calling the
class of the country. but in all fair-
ness it may be said that the Panthers
could have spared their adherents
ouite a little wear and tear on the
heart by putting that game in the
bag more easily. The Pitts missed
more under-the-basl-zet shots than
there are pins in a new shirt. But in
every way’, such as missing but two
tries at the foul line. Dr. Car1s0n’s
boys were hitting on all cylinders.

Pitt Behind At Half

The game started off with a Du-
quesne rush that put Panther follow-
ers into submission. After Birch 11a.d
popped in a long one. the count
mounted to 5-0 before the Panthers
got started. Then the Pitts turned
on the heat and ran up 10 points.
missing only one shot at the hoop in
that time. Duquesne picked up a lit-
tle then and brought it up to 11-9
mid-way in the ﬁrst half. Cribbs
broke a. deadlock at 15-15 by looping a
sensational one-handerr from the
side but the Dukes came in strong
again to take a 20-19 lead at the half.

iNoon and Roderick put the Pan-
thers ahead at the start of the sec-
ond half and then Mr. Birch and Mr.
Serauy took charge of things and put
the Bluffmen ahead for what looked
to be for good. Vvhen lankv Ed Kweller
sunk his shot on the foul that sent Skip
Hughes from the game, Pitt had its
darkest hour, being six points behind
the driving Dukes. A basket by

Cribbs was matched by one by Birch.
Jesko got another for Pitt, Miller,
looped a foul for Du.ru1esne and Rod-l
erick set the stage for the ﬁnale by'

University Event
At Track House

Games Open To All Students;
Expect Records To Tumble
In Saturday Carnival

Faculty Events Planned

‘When the gun sounds at exactly
1:30 o'clock on Satu1'day afternoon,
it. will mark the start of the Univer-
sity’s third annual indoor track and
ﬁeld meet. And when the ﬁnal echo
of the gun’s report leaves the track
house ether, it is expected that an-
other record-making and record-
breaking event on Pitt’s track cal-
endar will have left deﬁnite imprints
in this sport's annals.

Remembering what happened in
last year’s track carnival, in which
14 new marks were set and the meet
of the previous yea.r, in which ﬁve
records were made, it is highly prob-
able that next Sat111'oay’s spectacle
will likely eclipse both former meets
in the number of new records made.

In addition to the events listed on
the entry blank for varsity and fresh-
man entrants, two outstanding spec-
ialty contests, one only tentative at
the present time, have been lined 11p
to liven up the program.

Dale Schroedel, former Panther star,
hack in ’24, will match strides with
Carl Distelhorst, former Iowa crack
quarter-miler. This duel has been
brewing for a long time and anything
may happen when the boys get go-
ing. If either, or both, of the boys
are alive at the end of their race,
they will form the major pa.rt‘of a
track outﬁt, representing the account-
ing department of the Business Ad-
ministration school -in a challenge to
all comers.

The second feature of the afternoon
is as yet problematical. The managers
of Omar C. Held, personnel assistant
to the dean of the college, and Rus-
sell Ferguson. of the history depart-
ment, are still dickering on terms for
the event. It is rumored that one of
the contestants wants to throw arub-
ber shot. It is likely that Omar C.
I-Ield, personnel assistant to the dean
of the college, will win the event just
to make it‘ tough for_1'l1e liuotypers.

All students in the University are
eligible to compete in the games. Not
only that, but they will be welcomed
with open arms by Olson and his
assistants, for the chief aim of the
meet is to interest more boys in
track.

The D1'0Ced111‘e to be followed by all
prospective entrants is simple. Fill-
ing out the blank appearing below is
the lll‘Sl‘. requisite. Upon presenting
this at the stadium the entrant will
ﬁll out an athletic information card.
He will then take this to the Student
Health Service, where Doctors Carl-
son and Kowallis will determine if
his ticker (or heart, if you prefer) is
in good enough shape for him to
walk up to the track house and still
be able to run.

The next step is to .200 up to the
track house, where uniforms will be
issued to each and every entrant. This
may he done any day this week, the
obvious truth being that the more
practices indulged in the better will
be the showing on Saturday.

Officials for the meet will b_e Uni-

Last year the meet was featured by
a. murderous assault upon the rec-
ords, no less than 14 of them being
cracked or broken when the day’s
totals were turned in. The ﬁrst year
of the meet saw ﬁve marks, three in
track and two in ﬁeld events, wiped
off the books. ‘

Coach Olson is expecting to see a

cates that he will be disappointed if
the curtain fails to go up. All Uni-

Members Meet
To Re-Evaluate
l’ W Program

A group of 30 YVVCA members met
at Heinz House last week to consider
possible changes in the program of
the University YXVCA, and to propose
amendments to the constitution of
tlie organization.

The program was discussed in re-
1a‘ion to its expediency in answering
the purpose of the organization, it
part of which is quoted: “‘vVe unite
in the desire to realize full and crea--
tive life through a growing knowl-
edge of God.”

Some members charged that the
Association program laid too much
stress upon social change, and had
made that subject its “Golden Calf.”
But still others reiterated that the
organization should not attempt to
set up any deﬁnite religious policies,
but leave that up to the individual.
Both factions agreed that there should
be a closer correlation between the
