Sweating bodies bump and grind to
loud, pulsing music, while multi colored,
roving rainbow beams speckle the dance
ﬂoor, and ﬂickering strobe lights provide a
fantasy land that promises a few hours with-
out stressful thoughts of work or school.

“We are trying to teach people that get-
ting AIDS is

cially for
young peo-

yells Joe Yen
over the loud

pouring from

sound system.

Yen is a volunteer for the Youth
Empowerment Project, a local outreach
group that trains its volunteers to educate
gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgendered, and
straight teens and young adults about AIDS.

Every Tuesday and Thursday night,
Pegasus Lounge, a club frequented by gay
and straight people alike, has youth nights
for 18—and-over adults in the normally 21-
and—over club.

On youth nights, YEP sets up a table
covered with colorful pamphlets and small
plastic bags stuffed with condoms, a sexual
lubricant, and information on the different
Pittsburgh locations that offer HIV testing.

Most of the people in the club pass by
with an inquisitive glance, but only a few
stop at the table staffed by young adults
wearing black T—shirts labeled “Ask Me.”

Yen said that a lot of the people just
pass by because they are shy or embarrassed
about taking the condom packets. He is
hoping that YEP can get permission to set
up its table at Oakland’s Club Laga, a pop-
ular hangout for the over-18 crowd.

Young people who gather at clubs, cof-
fee houses and malls everywhere have a lot
to worry about — since the escalating rate
of new AIDS cases is higher in people under
the age of 25 than over 25.

New cases of AIDS are reportedly static
in people born before 1960, while for the

When Patty Garshak left
her part-time job working with
blind students on the second
ﬂoor of the William Pitt Union
Monday, she expected the ele-
vator to arrive as usual.

But, when the doors
opened, the car was nearly a
foot higher than the hallway
ﬂoor she was standing on.

“We were afraid to step on
it [the elevator],” she said. “We
were afraid we’d get trapped.”

Although the student
union’s elevators are usually
some of the most reliable on
campus, Garshak said she
thinks they need to be ﬁxed
quickly.

“I’d hate to be a blind per-

son leaving this office, because
they’d fall right in,” she said.
This is not the only place on
campus where this is the case.
However, Jeffrey Davis, an
account executive for Schindler
Elevator Corp., which does all
of Pitt’s elevator maintenance,

said Schindler has a contract I

with Pitt to do a million dollars
of renovations to University
facilities this summer.

This project is a part of the
ongoing renovation of Pitt’s
dorms.

Lothrop’s elevators are
to be the next stage of a long
renovation plan developed and
funded by the Housing Services
department.

The project, begun five
years ago, was designed to
upgrade residence hall eleva-

Ben Colins is back and healthy after recieving a heart transplant at UPMC.

He's got heart, finally

Elalne Cllfford

Staff Wrlter

Ben Collins’ bright hazel eyes and
glowing smile are the picture of
health. It’s hard to imagine this inde-
pendent 22-year-old lying in a hospi-

tal bed struggling with a seemingly

endless wait for a donor to replace his
wom-out heart.

Yet, that’s just what he did last fall
for two stress-filled months while
waiting for his donor heart.

Last November, Collins became
the first Pitt student to receive a heart
transplant at the University of
Pittsburgh’s Medical Center.

He found out he had a bad heart
three years ago in the spring of his
sophomore year when he started expe-
riencing shortness of breath and
extreme fatigue. By February, he
decided to visit Student Health
Service thinking he had the ﬂu. He
said he was amazed at the numerous
tests ordered and began to think it
might be something worse then a cold.

“I knew something was wrong
when I could barely climb the steps to
the third ﬂoor of the Cathedral. I’d be
so out of breath, I’d have to sit down.
I thought I was just out of shape,” said
Collins with a shake of his head.

Doctors at Student Health sent '

him to Presbyterian Hospital, where
he stayed for over two and a half
months after being diagnosed with
cardiomyopathy, or a damaged heart.

Collins’ older brother was diag-
nosed with a bad heart a year earlier,
so Ben wasn’t too shocked by the ver-
dict.

Collins began wearing a defibrila-
tor, which is a small device worn on
the left side of the waist with a wire
that runs up his body and is implanted

into his heart. This defibrilator gives
an electric shock to the wearer’s heart
if the heart rate increases too much.
This shock causes the heart to return
to its normal rate. Collins said the
shock made him feel like he was being
kicked in the stomach. He said he was
shocked at least eight times while
wearing the defibrilator.

After his two-and-a-half month
stay at Presby, he started classes again
in the fall and ran into the obstacle of
finding food to fit his low-sodium diet
while living on campus.

While searching for low-sodium
food at the Towers cafeteria, Collins
quarreled with cafeteria workers when
faced with no feasible meal option. He
ended up being shocked so badly by
his defibrilator that he was put back
into the hospital.

“When I asked them [cafeteria
staff] how to find low-sodium food,
no one knew what was in the food or
even how to find out,” said Collins.

Collins said he remembers him-
self as a rambunctious, hyperactive
child and said that none of his friends
or family are surprised when he gets
frustrated and loses his patience. He
said the biggest challenge with his
heart condition was the mental adjust-
ment of having to slow down and take
it easy.

Collins discovered that wearing a
defibrilator restricted the way he lived
his life. He went from being an active
college student who went to class full
time, worked full time, and danced at
clubs on the weekends, to a student
who had very little energy, and had to

watch what he ate and how much he V

slept.
Collins was adjusting well to tak-
ing things easy, but suddenly things

COLLINS

changed while house—sitting at a
friend’s apartment at the beginning of
last summer. He experienced mind-
numbing pain in his side. It was his
appendix that needed to be taken out.
This appendectomy added too much
strain on his heart and by Sept. 4, he
was back at Presby.

Only this time he was hooked up
to a Thoratec machine, which is a
cumbersome device on wheels that
the patient has to drag everywhere he
goes.

Dr. Stephen Winowich, on'e of
Collins’ doctors who is a clinical
manager in the artificial—heart pro-
gram at Presby, described the
Thoratec machine as being about the
size of a washing machine. It has
wires that hook into the patient’s left
side through two holes in the flesh.
These wires tap into a vein leading to
the heart and help patients with con—
gestive heart failure get blood and
oxygen ﬂowing to their heart. Collins
remained on the machine for the 61
days he waited for his heart surgery.

During that time, his blood’s
oxygen levels were only half as high
as a helthy person’s.

After losing his appendix, all
Collins could do was wait and hope
for a heart. This past fall he dropped
his classes and the hospital became
his home.

While he was on the Thoratec

machine waiting for a heart, Collins
encountered a major setback: He had
two strokes. The first occurred
October 1997 and left him with no
memory of the few days prior to the
attack, a loss of feeling in his last two
fingers of his left hand and a com-
plete loss of appetite. He still hasn’t
regained feeling in his left pinky.

A couple weeks after the first
stroke, Collins had a second one that
left the right side of his face without
muscle control for almost two days
and caused him to drool uncontrol-
lably.

“I was so embarrassed when that
happened, I hated walking through
the halls and having people stare at
me and wonder what was wrong with
me,” said Collins.

Collins entered the hospital at a
weighing 135 pounds. Because of his
loss of appetite after the first stroke,
he dropped to about 112 pounds. The
doctors warned him he had to
achieve a healthy weight before he
could have surgery. For Collins, this
was an excruciatingly unpleasant
week of liquid food fed to him
through a tube placed in his nose
which ran directly into his stomach.

The doctors were so worried by
his lack of weight gain that they even
told him to order out anything he
wanted. Collins said he finally
gained back most of his weight with
a two—week gorge fest of “O” burg-
ers, Burger King and pizza.

  

A SITE FOR LESS

The news he’d been waiting for
came on Nov.l8. A doctor came in
and told him a possible heart donor
was available and that he would
undergo surgery the next morning.
His family drove out to be with him
that night and at 8 a.m. he went into
surgery. Six hours later Collins
emerged from the operating room
with a new heart.

“The hardest thing to accept is
that someone had to die to give me a
second chance at life. The generosity
of the act is unbelievable,” said
Collins. _

Collins is trying to write a letter
to thank the family in Erie whose loss
of their 20-year-old daughter gave
him a second chance at life.

“I want to meet them, but I won’t
unless they initiate a person—to—per—
son meeting. This letter I’m writing
to them is taking me a while because
I can’t find all the words I want to
say, to let them know what this meant
to me,” said Collins.

Collins now is working full time
and expects to graduate with a busi-
ness and communications degree
after he completes his last semester
of classes next fall.

But he is still in the process of
recovering, slowly regaining lost
ground. Collins has to take an end-
less parade of pills each day and is on
an even stricter diet, but says that
he’s thankful for his second chance at
life.

AIDS

last few years the 18-24 age group is
showing an increasing rate of infec-
tion, according to the National
Cancer Institute.

As of 1996, Pennsylvania ranked
eighth in total AIDS cases in the
United States, with over 17,000.

YEP’s Project Director Matthew
Moyer said when the organization
started out three years ago, it mainly
reached out to gay and straight men.
A study done around that time found
that one in 13 men in Pittsburgh
under the age of 22 was HIV positive.

Moyer said YEP expanded its

young people after two lesbian
women who were HIV positive
approached him and  L   '  
said they felt YEP ’ "
should broaden its

women. _ -
Moyer said the: 
key to stopping the
spread of HIV is
education about pre-
vention. He said that
people need to know
that the majority of

   

HIV cases result
from people having
unprotected sex.

Since HIV is caused C
by the spread of
infected body ﬂuids,
a person can get HIV
from coming into
direct ﬂuid-to-ﬂuid
contact with an infected person’s
blood, semen, vaginal ﬂuids or breast
milk.

Another reason there is a great
need for education is the rumors that
people hear and begin to believe.

therapies that help keep HIV in the

them for a cure, said Moyer.

“We are concerned when people
say they heard 'there’s a cure. I have
kids that come in here saying they
heard Magic Johnson has been
cured,” he said..

Moyer said that it’s not that these
people don’t care, but that they are
misinformed and uneducated. The
proper informational material isn’t as
available as it should be, and that’s
why youth outreach groups are
important, he said.

Moyer recently hosted a discus-
sion about increasing rates of HIV in
the 18 to 24 age group at Pittsburgh’s
Gay and Lesbian Community Center.

The center’s cramped second
ﬂoor rooms rang with exuberant
teenage greetings, playful insults and

song “Frozen” playing in the back-
ground. They were there for their
weekly community meeting.

The. main meeting room’s couch-
es, chairs and ﬂoor space soon
became packed with warm, sprawling
bodies as Sharon, the center’s direc-
tor, introduced Moyer to the group.

‘Of the dozen or so males and females

   
    

there, about «half were high school
students.

- Many of them wandered in and
out of the room during the informal
group’ discussion, and everyone intro-
duced themselves using just their
first names to preserve their confi-
dentiality.

After hearing Moyer state that
their age group was showing a trend
of increasing HIV and full—blown
AIDS infection, people said they

really hadn’t heard much about AIDS ‘

in the school system since grade
school. I
John, a gay high school student,
said the harsh reality would be driven
home more directly if the school sys-
tems brought a young HIV-positive
person to come and speak every year
at all the local high schools.
 Stephen, a white gay college
student, knows five friends
from his high school back in his
rural hometown who are HIV
positive. He said the two whose
condition upset him most are an
HIV positive boyfriend and
girlfriend that are expecting
twins.

Nicole Maeshafi, a petite, 20-
year-old lesbian Pitt student is a
volunteer of YEP, a health
chairperson at the Rainbow
Alliance, and sits on the board
of directors at the GLCC in
Squirrel Hill.

She spends most of her free
time educating young people
about being tolerant of different
lifestyles. Through Rainbow
Alliance, she helps refer young

‘adults to gay-friendly doctors, and
' helps staff the HIV-awareness tables

for YEP.

Maeshafi said that because AIDS
effects both gay and straight men and
women, more groups must be formed
to educate people of her age group
earlier on ——- so that teenagers have a
fightingchance against the disease.

tors, some of which have not been reno-
vated in 40 years.

The past three summers have wit-
nessed the modernizationof the elevators
in Towers A, B, and C. Housing Services
is only able to work on one set of elevators
per year due to summer activities requir-
ing use of the residence halls, and the
extensive preparation and cost involved.
Funding for the project comes mainly
from student housing charges paid to the
department, which does not receive
University funding. .

Packets of blueprints and specifica-
tions are prepared to be sent to outside
construction ﬁrms interested in bidding
for the job. *

“There is an extensive amount of
preparation which goes into these pro-
jects,” said Harry Burner, assistant direc-
tor of housing services. “We started the
process nine months ago for the work
we’re hoping to do this summer in
Lothrop.”

A priority list is detennined and re-
evaluated armually to determine the dorm
elevators in greatest need of the renova-
tions. Maintenance records and reported
student complaints are factors in prioritiz-
ing. the elevator maintenance.

Housing Services depends on stu-
dents to report elevator problems by ﬁlling
out maintenance request slips located at
security desks in the residence halls. These
requests are recorded in the department’s
database and forwarded to the full-time,
on-campus, ﬁve—person elevator mainte-
nance staff.

. A Facilities Management worker who
wished to remain anonymous said any
problems occurring outside of Facilities
Management regular office hours should
be reported to the Pitt Police. They will
then pass them on to Schindler.

Davis said he blames students for
many of the elevator problems. He
believes it is student misuse which causes
many of the problems, and supports the
proposal of installing “key-offs,” devices
that will only allow the elevators to be shut
off with a special key. ,

Students living in Lothrop do not feel
responsible for the elevator problems in
their dorm.

?‘The elevators will go up to the top
ﬂoor, back to the bottom, and then will go
to the ﬂoor you wanted, if you push the
button again,” said Lothrop resident Erin
Burton.

She added that it is not uncommon for
only one of the four elevators in the resi-
dence hall to _be working on weekends.

Yessenia, Khadija and Crissy, also
residents of Lothrop, who did not give
their last names, complained of having to
drag luggage down ﬂights of stairs when
the elevators stopped working at the start
of Christmas break. They also reported
having to watch their step while entering
and exiting elevators that don’t always
open level with the ﬂoor.

No one could be reached to comment
on who inspects Pitt’s elevators.

DEADLY CUSA

  

 

A cure for cold
fronts and UV rays

Pitt is still in the quiet stages of a $500 million
capital campaign. Chancellor Nordenberg, the
Department of Institutional Advancement and many
others are in the middle of securing donations and
endowments from , outside sources to increase
University revenue for the coming years. But they
have not yet made any official public announcement
about what uses the new capital will be put to.

As always, this newspaper has a suggestion:
Climate Control.

This winter was very disappointing. No heavy
snow. No sled-riding in Schenley Park. No unexpect-
ed vacation days. Winter was a real'bummer.

And spring looks like it is going to be confused,
too. The high temperature should drop to about 50
degrees just in time for an April Fools’ joke on every-
body who pulled their shorts and tank tops out of the
closet. By Friday, we could even see a light snow.

The fact that the weather is so hard to predict

makes it mandatory that, whenever nice weather
appears, Vitamin-D deprived students take advantage
of it, never knowing when Pittsburgh will offer unfet-
tered sunlight again, if ever.

You can also see the effects of a ﬁckle Pittsburgh
climate manifest themselves as a real threat to stu-
dents‘ health when you see the girls who run around
in 20-degree cold without a jacket.

So, in the name of helping students physically,

 psychologically and academically, Pitt should make it

a priority to control the Oakland climate.

A giant, transparent-plastic geodesic dome should
be well within the $500 million Pitt is planning to
obtain. And the cost of air conditioners, gas heaters,
artiﬁcial-sunlight lamps and precipitation modulators
could easily be covered by the overcharging on meal
plans.

In addition, Pitt would save money in other ways
by controlling the campus climate in different sectors
of Oakland. '

For example, by keeping it from precipitating
near the athletics facilities, Pitt could probably knock
$50 million off the price of a convocation center by
not giving it a roof.

And the football team would never have to move
practice indoors on a rainy day, decreasing the likeli-
hood that the lacrosse team will be kicked out of its
practice session. ,

And by negating the need to resurface Pitt's out-
door ﬁelds, which get ﬂooded in a minor drizzle, the
baseball and softball teams might get a chance to play
their games, too.

OPINIONS

Monday, 30 March 1998

Kevin Carey

columnlst

I don't know about you, but
when the stresses of "VV1ll school
ever end?" get into my head, I
immediately realize it's time for a
bowl of ice cream. Maybe it's just
me, but nothing gets me going like
a good mouthful of chocolate ice
cream.

Last month, with the loads of
work that precede spring break, I
had a number of these stressful
incidents take place. At one point, I
recognized the symptoms of one of
these attacks while hanging out at
my friend's dorm. I looked at her
and I said, "Sorry, honey, but I
need my ice cream. '_' Voom! Off I
went in pursuit of ice cream. (She
has been known to call me Clark
Kent over that disappearing act.)

Well it turned out that in my j_

frantic escape from the over-
whelming stresses of school, and a
really foul-smelling dorm room, I
left the building without having
signed out in the guest book. For
the sake of argument, let us just say
that, oh, 30 of these cataclysms,
leaving me helpless for ice cream,
may have occurred in the past two
months or so. (Those numbers, like
cookie dough in ice cream, are
raw.)

After leaving the dorm, I went
down Forbes, and I bought a cone
from Dave and Andy's ice cream
shop. I personally try to be loyal to
the local businessman; it is one of
those little lessons in life my dad
beat into my head. I purchased a
cone, and life was grand.

Two weeks ago, my friend
received a letter in the mail from
the Office of Residence Life, stat-
ing to the tee the number of times

The Pitt News

that I have gone out for ice cream
in the last month. Oops, what I
mean was, the number of times
that a guest was not signed out.
The letter was accompanied by the
demand to pay a $20 fine, or in my
friend's terms, almost seven packs
of cigarettes.

Then, after a week of limited
tobacco, my friend received anoth-
er letter from the Office of
Residence Life. Well, it so hap-
pened that the letter informed her

she was going to be refunded the '

$20 fine for not signing her guests
out.

It turned out that the Ofﬁce of
Residence Life had issued some
700 ﬁnes, which at $20 apiece,
makes for roughly one-half of the
chancellor's latest bonus check.
The chancellor, in keeping with the
wonderful progress that he has
achieved thus far, realized that
something was wrong with the sys-
tem and refunded the students their
money. _

Out of this recent affair, a few
questions have to be raised.

Why do you need to sign peo-
ple in and out of the guest book?
The obvious answer seems to be to
ensure the safety of both the resi-
dents and their belongings.

There are alternative answers,
however. The violation of students’
privacy allows for Pitt's upper
house to maintain its voyeuristic
side. Or, it could be that the guest
book is there solely for the amuse-
ment of the Pinkerton Security
guards and the harassment of Pitt
students.

In 1892, the
Homestead was fought. It was _a
very signiﬁcant event in the histo-
ry of Pittsburgh, and moreover in
the history of labor development in

the United States. Striking
Carnegie Steel mill workers, were
replaced by scab workers, who
were defended by armed Pinkerton
security guards. The Pinkerton
guards were met by the striking
workers, and conﬂict ensued. Ten
people were killed that day: seven
townspeople and three security
guards.

Why then does the University
fulﬁll its security needs by con-
tracting with Pinkerton Security?
The obvious answer is because it is
a huge, inexpensive security firm.
The alternative answer: The
University of Pittsburgh has a
fondness for union busters, which
Pinkerton security is infamous for
being. The University of
Pittsburgh's anti-union sentiment is
not something new (see the Pitt
maintenance workers for further
examples of University exploita-
tion).

With the above information in
mind, I think it is clear to see that
the University is not only sensitive
to local history, but that it also
understands that loyalty is a good
thing. (Fortunately, my dad was
not lying to me all these years.)

For the University to ignore
the history of southwestern
Pennsylvania is a travesty and a
sellout (par for the course at Pitt).

The University is entirely too
concerned about saving money.
Yet somehow, the chancellor was
allocated a raise that is probably
higher than at least a third of the
current University employees‘
salaries. You try and ﬁgure it out.

It's been 150 years since the
"Communist Manifesto" was first

published by Frederick Engels and

Karl Marx (no, not a Marx Brother,
but almost as funny). I'd like to point
out some interesting quirks of a sys-
tem supported by numerous people on
this campus and then shed light on
some startling similarities between
socialism and our current govern-
ment. '

While Cuba plans to celebrate the
sesquicentennial, its citizens have

been leaving in flocks at the risk of

death. While contemplating the feared
drownings of fellow baseball players
and a coach boating to the_$Dominican
Republic, Orlando Hernandez com-

mented that death was well worth ,

escaping the Castro regime. While the
majority of the population lives in
poverty and thousands have risked
everything to leave, declaring Cuban
communism a success is foolish.
However, in speaking with a num-
ber of Marx advocates, I've found that
many believe communism's many

~ failures have been due to the fact that

"nobody's done it right, yet." Okay,
let's see, in 150 years not one govern-
ment has been able to achieve success
through this system. However, a list-
ing of successful noncommunist and
nonsocialist governments would be

people, when asked what the effect of
communism implemented in the
United States would have on religion,
respond that freedom of religion will
remain intact. Again, history demon-
strates that flaw. Churches were torn
down in the Soviet Union, Stalin sent
practitioners of certain religions to
gulags in Siberia, and China forces
women to have abortions against their
will. When moving beyond utopian
theory, the terms freedom and commu-
nism (or socialism), in practical reali-
ty, are incompatible.

Another religious argument pre-
sented entices Christians with the
mention that early Christians lived in
and Jesus promoted communist liv-
ing. This is’ key: Early Christians
chose to give up their money, cloth-
ing, boats and all other possessions to
live together as a communist commu-
nity. However, with communist gov-
ernments, voluntary membership is
not an option. Communism subverts
the will of the people in favor of the
will of the governing elite.

That's another irony: Communism
promotes itself as a method of placing
power in the hands of the proletariat
(or people). In reality, communism
simply creates a new governing elite
who effectively. control and reap the

message: "Even two years after

suffered from manic depression,

Hyperbole is

I'm writing in response to James

onto the hyperboles themselves.

An alternative to hating hyper-
boles is to push them further. I
could be wrong, but I doubt that Mr.
Maude hates every form of exagger-
ation. I agree that cheap writing is
annoying, especially when it is
appreciated more than writing done
by those with integrity, but hyper-
bole is not necessarily cheap, and it
is not always used for humor.

For instance, a good hyperbole
taken to its fullest extent turns into
magical realism, which is some of
the richest and deepest literature
available. Maybe once upon a time
Gabriel Garcia Marquez said, after
having slept for a night, "I can't
remember a thing!" and it evolved
into the chronic memory loss expe-
rienced by victims of the insomnia
plague in his novel "One Hundred
Years of Solitude."

Maybe, even further back in
time, when someone wrote, "The
rain fell on the earth forty days and
forty nights," the hyperbole was at
its best, and the writer intended for
people to take it seriously.

Panthers swept in three-game set

Matt Mento
Staff Wrlter

The Rutgers Scarlet Knights, Big
East baseball postseason regulars for
over a decade, showed their strength this
weekend with a tlrree-garne sweep of
the Pitt Panthers —— the ﬁrst time a Big
East team has been swept all season.

In game one, Pitt was outlasted by a
strong pitching performance by senior
Mike Mundy, who earned a 4-1 victory.
He pitched a complete game, giving up
one run on four hits while striking out a
career-high eight batters.

Scoring began in the bottom of the
first as Rutgers left ﬁelder Adam
Neubart scored oﬁ a ﬁelder’s choice.
The Panthers retaliated quickly in the
top of the second, though, after second
baseman Charles Staﬂord doubled in
Jason Oliver.

Pitt kept the game close ——
Rutgers scored again to take a 2-1 1
—— behind a steady pitching performance
from John Schultz.

But in the bottom of the sixth, third
baseman Jake Daubert’s two-RBI single
to center broke the game open for the
Knights to conclude the game’s scoring.

    
 
 

6:: zes sted less than two innings on Sunday.

Since both of Saturday’s games were
shortened to seven innings due to the
doubleheader (a common college base-
ball practice), Pitt had only one more
chance at tying the contest. The Panthers
failed to score in the top of the seventh,

though, preserving Rutgers’
three-run victory.

After Mundy’s strong
pitching performance, the
Scarlet Knights’ bats exploded
in the second game, creating 12
runs on 16 hits and defeating
Pitt 12-2.

Pitcher Chris Gallick

ged only two and one-third

game with six rims. Neubart

ﬁeld and scored on a sacriﬁce
ﬂy by second baseman Dave

hits would follow before the

The Scarlet Knights added two more

In the third and ﬁnal game, Pitt’s

New boat highlights crew's spring season

Matt Townsend

column, page 10

Assistant Sports Editor

VV1th a sparkling new aluminum boat
-—— thanks to the Student Allocations
Committee — this spring’s Pitt men’s crew
team will have a little more levy in shirt
betting.

Yes, shirt betting — the often-prac-
ticed prerace wager between
competing boats that strips the
losingcrewofitsteamshirtsand
a little pride.

“If you lose, you shake
hands and hand over your
sweaty shirt after the race,” said
men’s team captain Chris
Holwick. “It’s pretty cool
because you hang out, get to know the
other teams and help yourwardrobe at the
same time.”

The new boat will be oared by
Holwick’s lightweight four-man squad —
the best on the team right now —— on rivers
from the Allegheny to the Potomac this
spring season. Collegiate crew is divided
into lightweight and heavyweight divi-
sions. Men must weigh in at meets under
160 pounds and women under 135 pounds
to qualify for lightweight racing. The
heavyweight division has no weight

restrictions.

“Thisisalighter,stiﬂerb0atthatwill'

make us faster in the water,” said Holwick.
“This boat has aluminum siding, which
makes it lighter. It’s exciting because we
haven’t had a new boat in a while.”
T‘lrePittarmada——boththemen’s and
women’s teams — is 12 boats strong. In
last weekend’s ﬁrst scrimmage of the year

  

at Bucknell, both teams competed.
Holwick’s four-man squad, using the new
boat, tied another Pitt squad for second in
the 2,000 meters and Pitt’s heavyweight
four-man, using another boat, placed third.

In preparation for the spring season,
both the men’s and women’s teams have
been practicing six days a week at 5:30
am. in the Allegheny River, just below the
31st Street Bridge.

“The practice makes all of us manage
our time we ,” said Holwick

Todd Ridenour is entering his third

year as Pitt’s men’s coach and has an expe-
rienced retuming team. Only three team
members graduated after last season, and
the four-man lightweight team is manned
by four seniors.

“Our strength has been the light-
weights,” said Holwick. “We’ve been row-
ing together since our freshman year.”

An average race lasts seven minutes
and 250 strokes. During the
race, the coxswain steers the
boat and the four or eight—man
team combines bursts of legs,
_ back and arm movements to

glide through the water.

 A crew member needs
strength, but big biceps don’t
always win.

“A team has to be eﬂicient with their
strokes,” said Holwick “We [lightweights]
have beat heavyweight teams because of
better technique.”

The Pitt men’s and women’s goal is to
compete well in the Dadvail Regatta in
Philadelphia Dadvail is a two-day race
with hundreds of schools competing. A
good race there qualiﬁes a boat for the
Intercollegiate Rowing Association
Regatta the ﬁrst week of June.

“Dadvail is our goal,” said Holwick
“This year we want to win.”

Pitt swimmer deals with
being an asthmatic athlete

Jay Yander

Staff Writer

The next time you think asthma is an
uncommon ailment among the population,
think again.

About one in 14 people have asthma,
ranging from the occasional attack to
severe daily attacks.

Pitt freshman swimmer Joe Stone is
one of the many who has the condition
known medically as “severe exercise and

allergy—induced asthma.”

Stone sometimes wakes in the middle
of the night unable to breathe. He is forced
to use one of his several inhalers in hopes
of opening his blocked bronchial tubes.

Most of the time this type of treatment
succeeds and Stone falls back asleep. But
every couple of months he must resort to
utilizing his nebulizer. I

‘The good days outweigh the bad by

While it’s very rare for an asthma
patient to own a nebulizer because of its
price and thephysical size (similar to that
of a television), Stone does. VV1thout one,
his visits to the hospital would be more fre-
quent.

When these bad days occur, Stone typ-
ically will do one, maybe two sessions
with the nebulizer, but when a third dose is
necessary, a hospital visit is recommended.

“I actually had to be admitted to the

hospital yesterday,” Stone said. “It got to.

be 4 a.m. and I still couldn’t breathe. So I
checked myself in [the hospital].”

In this instance, Stone completed two
nebulizer sessions with no relief to his
lungs. The next step was to take his daily
peak expiratory ﬂow, which is the mea-
surement of the exhalation of the lungs
using a peak ﬂow meter.

The normal PEF is 800, but yesterday
Stone’s PEF was about 300. He decided to

far,” Stone said.
“But when those Q
bad days occur,
I’m ready with the , '
nebulizer.” 
A nebulizer is 
a device that uses 
pressurized air to ‘

turn a liquid medication int a e mist for 0

inhalation.

The pressurized air typically comes
from a portable pump unit that consists of
a motor—driven air pump that forces air
through a tube into the nebulizer unit.

When Stone breathes the medication,
his lungs can gradually begin to operate
normally again. In addition, Stone ﬁnds the
mist, a sterile saline solution, to be sooth-
mg.

At the hospital
3 emergency room,
T Stone used a nebuliz-
“  er four more times to
. no avail. He was
g . admitted to the hospi-
s *   V ' .  ‘ * tal as an in—patient
when his lungs’ oxygen saturation fell
from 99 percent to 80 percent.

Stone was diagnosed with asthma
when he was 9 years old. His mother has a
very minor case of asthma, and uses an
inhaler at most once a year.

A child is 50 percent more likely to
experience asthma if the mother, suffers
from the disease, regardless of the asthma’s
severity. That number increases to 67 per-
cent when both parents are inﬂicted by the

 

disease.

Stone is also affected by several aller-
gens, including dust mites and pollen, but
he controls these by receiving allergy shots
every few months.

Stone has seen his asthma’s effects
lessen since receiving the allergy shots, but
his biggest relief has been swimming.

“The moist, humid air surrounding a
pool has been nothing but helpful for my
asthma,” Stone said. “Obviously, the exer-
cise irritates my lungs, but the humid air
helps a lot.”

According to Stone, there are several
steps that can be taken to help avoid asth-
ma attacks. Knowing what “triggers” you

are sensitive to is an important step in con-

trolling the attacks.

‘“l‘riggers” are airborne particles that
one breathes in. They come from a variety
of sources, indoors and out. Such triggers
are cigarette and wood smoke, dust mites,

 oe Stone says the swimming poo hlps is breathing.

molds, pollen, animal dander, cold air,
strenuous exercise, colds, the ﬂu and even
laughing.

Another precaution ‘ Stone takes to
control his asthma is to take several types
of medication every day, and “probably for
the rest of my life,” according to Stone.

“Asthma is ‘incorporated within my
life now,” Stone said. ‘There isn’t anything
that I’m not prepared for.” A n ti —
inﬂammatory drugs, such as oral steroids
called prednisone and prednisolone, are
common for asthma. cases as severe as
Stone’s.

The drugs aid in preventing attacks
before their onset by reducing the swelling
around the windpipes and decreasing the
production of mucus.

“These drugs prevent me from having
to use the nebulizer a lot,” Stone said. “It’s
much more convenient not having to rely
on the nebulizer.”

The Cleveland Indians came within
two outs of ﬁnally winning the World Series
last year, and with a few off-season transac-
tions, they probably made themselves even
better this year.

Having already given away my predic-
tion for the American League pennant win-
ner, let’s take a division—by—division look at
the AL, in predicted order of ﬁnish.

EAST

1. New York If Hideki Irabu makes
more positive headlines than negative ones,
the Yankees will have a pitching staff
almost as impressive as their batting order.
If he doesn’t, holding off Baltimore may
prove to be more of a challenge than most
observers think.

2. Baltimore. One Baltimore writer has
suggested that the Orioles’ stadium be
renamed Jurassic Park for this season.
You’ ve probably heard lots of similar jokes
about these “Old-rioles,” but most of them
can still play. The catch is that even if these
ancient guys stay healthy all season (which
isn’t likely), tl1ey’re probably looking at a
wild card at best.

3. Boston. Few teams, especially in the
AL, have such a marked drop—oiT in talent
from the top of the lineup to the bottom. But
if Mo Vaughn keeps his nose clean off the
ﬁeld, he can single—handedly win games on
the ﬁeld. The Red Sox have enough pitch-
ing to support their meager offense.

THE PITT NEWS

4. Toronto. Speaking of a meager
offense, how bad is Toronto? The Blue
Jays’ top candidate to bat is some person
named Shannon Stewart. Toronto might
have the best starting rotation north of
Atlanta, but there is an offensive “point of
no return” that pitching can’t overcome, and
the Blue Jays are past it.

5. Tampa Bay. Wade Boggs, Fred

McGriﬁ, Wﬂson Alvarez? This doesn’t

        
   

Tigers. Pitcher Justin Thompson and ﬁrst
baseman Tony Clark provide enough star
power to lead the team and to draw fans,
and the supporting cast provides enough
solid play to give the Tigers their ﬁrst win-
ning season since the Sparky Anderson era.
In this weak division, they could stay close
enough to Cleveland to make September
interesting.

better than the NL’s Diamondbacks this

compete with good teams. -

CENTRAL

1. Cleveland. This team will score
some mns, especially now that Kenny
Lofton is back to lead off. The pitchers, par-
ticularly new acquisition Dwight Gooden,
can’t possibly be as bad all season as they
have been this spring. By October, they
should be leading the Tribe back to the
World Series.

2. Detroit. No team beneﬁted more
from this year’s realignment than the

traded away everyone in the organization
who could pitch. That will catch up to the
White Sox this year.

4. Kansas City. Jay Bell is gone, leav-
ing Jose Olferman and a bunch of rookies to
man the middle inﬁeld. So while fans may
not get to see a good team, at least every
ground ball will be an adventure. Kevin
Appier won’t be a Royal ﬁve months from
now — look for any pitching—hung1y pen-
nant contender to grab him — but by that
time some of the young talent should have
matured enough to keep the team out of last
place.

5. Minnesota. The Twins want to move

Moak’s Best B1 returns: Cleveland Indians are Series bound

to North Carolina very badly. Trading pop-
ular and talented second baseman Chuck
Knoblauch is something that could only be
done by an organization that wants to be
hounded out of the Twin Cities.

WEST

1. Seattle. The Mariners traded away
J ose Cruz Jr. last year to improve a notori-
ously poor bullpen. It didn’t work. There are
enough all-stars on this team to win the divi-
sion anyway, but not enough to win a
league championship.

2. Anaheim. For a team that not long
ago had both Tony Phillips and Rickey
Henderson, the Angels have a conspicuous
hole at the top of the order. Even so, Cecil
Fielder is sure to drive in runs, and the addi-
tion of Jack McDowell gives Anaheim an
above-average pitching stalf. The Angels
are probably the ﬁfth—best team in the
league and might contend for a playoff spot.

3. Texas. Take away closer John
Wetteland, and the Rangers pretty much
have a Triple—A pitching staff. They can
score nms when Ivan Rodriguez and Juan
Gonzalez are both healthy, but that hasn’t
happened since the Nixon administration.

4. Oakland. Rickey Henderson returns
to the A’s in 1998, but he’s still the only
player on this squad you’ve ever heard of.
The pitching stalf is led by retreads Torn
Candiotti and Kenny Rogers —— they would
make nice third and fourth starters, but
when they’re the aces, it’s going to be a long
season. The bright side is the A’ s, can’t get
much worse than they were last year.

defense that immediately helps mis-
matched teammates when beaten,
which isn’t very often.

They aren’t flashy, opting for the
open—bounce pass and layup over the
no-look, behind-the-back pass to a
dunking skywalker. Their highlights
are never acrobatic, but James
Naismith would get a kick out of
them.

THE PITT NEWS

No one could have predicted
Utah’s relatively easy wins over
reigning champ Arizona and giant
North Carolina.

Even the Utes’ own coach, Rick
Majerus, admitted before the tourna-
ment that the team didn’t expect to or
even talk about reaching San
Antonio.

But its in Texas, and its next
opponent, the Kentucky Wildcats,
will fall like the Goliaths who Utah
has already set aside.

Kentucky is basically a perimeter
team with the exception of Nazy
Mohammed’s post play. Utah will
collapse on Mohammed just like it
did to UNC’s Antawn J amison,‘ forc-
ing Kentucky to shoot from the out-
side, "where it is superb —— but so
were Arizona and UNC.

Kentucky’s long bombers will hit
from the outside in the beginning of
tonight’s game, but later they will
misfire clue to an aggressive Utah
defense and fatigue from Saturday’s
grueling « overtime win against
Stanford.

. Utah will win tonight on its
rebounding and physical play, and
once again the realization will sur-
face that these 63 games are the
Greatest Show on Earth. »

Matt Townsend is the assistant sports
editor of The Pitt News.

 FROM PAGE 7

off Pitt pitcher Kevin Lazeski, who
recorded his ﬁrst loss of the season.

First baseman Pete Zoccolillo
led the Knight oﬁense with runs
scored in the ﬁrst and second frames,
and an RBI single in the third.
Pitcher Eric Rosing replaced Lazeski
late in the second to end the inning,
but Rosing would give up two rims
in the third on two hits. _

The Panther comeback began in
the sixth with an RBI single from
Oliver. Pitt shortstop Lou Melucci
took advantage of a miscue in center
field by Shawn Williams to add
another run for Pitt, who went on to
add one more run in the inning on a
ﬁelder’s choice. ,

In the eighth, the Panthers struck
again with an RBI double by Oliver,
who went on to score on a ﬁelder’s
choice. Rutgers ﬁnally closed the
door on Pitt in the ninth after second
baseman Greg Stokes’ RBI single.

With the three-game sweep, the
Panthers’ record falls to 5-10 overall
and 1-4 in the Big East.

Pittsburgh will host Duquesne

University on Tuesday, March 31 at

2 p.m. at Trees Field.

Because Pitt was on the road
back from Rutgers Sunday, the team
was unavailable for comment.
