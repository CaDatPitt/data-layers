  Chancellor

Supports
State Aid

Chancellor Edward H.
Litchﬁeld defended state aid
to higher education before a

dinner meeting of the Uni- ,

versity’s Johnstown campus

advisory board and, alumni‘

Friday. ,

‘Dr. Litchﬁeld said that Penn-
sylvania has “a real’ investment”
in public support as a result of
curtailing‘ or eliminating the pre-
sent system of state aid to higher
institutions.

“The state's founding fathers
instituted such support/’ihe said,
“because they felt that certain
private institutions were doing a
job which had public merit and
value.” As a result, the Common-
wealth receives “more value for
its taxpayers’ money_ by contrib-
uting partial support to private
institutions . . . rather than trying

to duplicate ‘the same facilities at.

public expense.”
' Costly Expenses

Duplicating the same facilities,
according to Dr. Litchﬁeld, would
be many times more costly than
the original expense of building
them. Dr. Litchﬁeld askedif the
state could afford to construct so
many facilities in so many ﬁelds.

The Chancellor added that the
private university's contribution
to the state is unique. Although
originally state-supported to aid
in educating large numbers of
state residents, the modern pri-
vate institution has other func-

. tions as well.

Dr. Litchﬁeld thinks _all these
functions are worthy of public
support. It is important for a uni-
versity to do research and serve
as a central economic resource ‘for
its region, he added. Dr. Litch-
ﬁeld wondered if a university was
any less deserving of public aid
because it concentrated its re-
sources in the preparation of per-
sons with the new professional
and technical skills so vital to the
economy.

States Recognize Need ‘

According to the Chancellor,
(Massachusetts, Texas, and Cali-
fornia have all demonstrated their
need for such institutions, and
have benefitted economically from
them.

School Not Committed to Prestige up

~ By NANCY DELANEY

The University of Pitts-
burgh is not completely com-
mitted to either humane
values, or to prestige; instead
its commitment lies some-

where between, postulated
Dr. Bernard Adams at Monday’s
SUB Coffee Hour. _ .
Dr. Adams, special ‘assistant to
the Chancellor is leaving his posi-
tion to become "Dean pf Students
at Oberlin College. -
The liberal arts experience of
the undergraduate here suffers
in spite of the great improve-
ment in the faculty, because of
the “absence of a really chal-
lenging honors program.” Ac-
cording to Dr. Adams, one in-
dication of this lack, is the spar-
city of‘ Woodrow Wilson fellows.
who come from the University.
William French, assistant to the
dean ‘of liberal arts, countered
from the audience that three of
the eleven University applicants
received Wilson awards, and this
was a very good average. Dr.
Adams que'stion_ed, however, why
there were so few students stim-

 

ulated to apply; wouldn’t more

apply if they had had experience the University is going to admit

toughest standards anywhere." If S"

Dr. Adams also noted the im- gram for them to begin in, Adams 
provement in curriculum. He suggested. ' ’

wondered however, if the strain
for breadth did not result in some
‘sacriﬁce of depth in students’
knowledge.

Despite his comment that “I’m
optimistic about the future of the
University,” Dr. Adams verbalized
the fear that the university might
“diversify so much, look so far
ahead . . . [that] emphasis will
shift from the undergraduate s_t_u-,
dent.” ,

And to Dr. Adams, a liberal arts‘
university should center around
its undergraduate program.

“There are students here as
least as good as anywhere, ac-
cording to Dr. Adams; but there
are also too many students who
who have “no business at this
or any other institution that
pretends to higher excellence.”

 Editorial: The Right Idea

Why the University had only three Woodrow Wilson scholars last
year seems the crux of—the shallowness of our Liberal Arts program.

At the SU forum on Monday, Dr. Bernard Adams listened to As-
sistant to the Dean of Liberal Arts William French explain thesmall
number of fellowships. Only 23 applied, French pointed out, and then
half ofthose withdrew. The Wilson Foundation had assured him, he con-

was quite commendable.

A young lady further noted that the University is in the most
competitive region in the country for this set of awards — the north-
east," neck and neck" with the Ivy League schools.

 Adams listened and then asked the’ logical question; Why don’t

 more students‘ apply for the grants? '

‘V ' ' The answer’ was -the premise for his Forum address: though the

"University has advanced steadily in academics since Adams came here
seven years ago, emphasis on other areas of growth have- left the un-
dergraduate Liberal Arts program bucking the " graduate schools, re-
search, and big business so that only parts of it have reached any level

 

tinued, that our percentage of winners from the number of applications '

The faculty has improved greatly, but there are sti1l“‘lemons” and

too many of the quality professors are put with graduateclasses or load-

ed up until there is little opportunity for office time with their under-
graduates. , ‘

«Student quality has similarly improved, but that element Adams
describedgas not qualiﬁed to go to a state school up the river has keyed
the undergraduate program to the median instead of the excellent. .

As for the curriculum, Adams continued, the distribution system
offers breadth instead ofidepth, and the stimulating honors programs
that give the outstanding student a- meaningful program are. depart-
mental projects rather than spread across the board.

‘There are. few applicants for Woodrow Wilson fellowships ‘be-
cause there is little direction of the undergraduate mind toward such
an endeavor. The University is proud that its graduate schools are ﬁlled
with students from without its own graduating classes; it seems -time
for a systematic effort to stimulate its undergraduates for such academic
pursuits.‘ ‘

 

of excellence.

Eisetnhower and Goldwater

Policies of Abclication

‘During the past three or four weeks former
President Eisenhower has given a singularly hide-

 ous performance ‘on the American political stage.

On the eve of the primary election in California he

(forcefully denied that his _“declaration of Republi-
can principles” constituted a repudiation of the

views of Senator Barry ﬁoldwater.
Mr. Eisenhower, however, chose to emphasize

if-his commitment to the United Nations, to the social

security program, and to _the Republican raison
d’etre, civil rights —— precisely those issues which
dramatize most vividly the enormous ideological
schism between post-war Republicanism and Gold-
water “conservatism.” —
And minutes before William Scranton’s ap-
pearance on the CBS interview, “Face the
- Nation,” in which the Pennsylvanian had planned
to deliver a ﬁrm statement condemning the Ari-
zona _Senator, Eisenhower (who on the previous

A ‘day had encouraged Governor Scranton’s active

candidacy) informed Scranton that any anti-
- Goldwater remarks would have an effect anti-
thetical to the party interest. —

On both occasions Eisenhower, once again dis-
playing ‘his mastery of the ﬁne art of indecision,
reversed his positions, the‘ results of which have
proven costly. First by denying that his “declara-
tion of principles” was meant to exclude any candi-
date (even though the Herald-Tribune, the Certi-
ﬁed Leak of Republican politics, insisted that the
Eisenhower article was clearly a slap at Gold-
water), it nonetheless had a catalytic effect in Sen-
ator Goldwater’s eleventh-hour resurgence and ul-
timate victory in California; and secondly, his aban-
donment of Scranton prevented the Governor, from
announcing his candidacy a full week earlier, a
delay which may be fatal to Governor Scranton's

' campaign.

Vacillation is hardly a novel behavior pattern,
in the political career of'Mr. Eisenhower. His
moral withdrawal during the McCarthy period,
his hesitation in enforcing civil rights, even his
semi-participation" in Richard Nixon's campaign
represent something the analysis of which is best

‘ left to the historians.

F By Al Schlosser

Incredibly enough, General Eisenhower has
chosen to remain neutral in the struggle for the Re-
publican Presidential nomination. It is his. belief
that a posture of noninvolvement assures an- open
convention and party unity. Time has already
proven him wrong, for his passivity’ has assured
neither; indeed it has hastened the ‘ascendancy of
Barry Goldwater. Noninvolvement in the present
situation is but a natural extension of Eisenhower’s
image of himself. _

How can General Eisenhower pretend that
Senator Goldwater in some Procrusteanl contor-
tion, is a Republican in the tradition of Lincoln,

Roosevelt, and himself? The differences between »

Goldw’ater’s views and the Republican platform
as articulated in 1960 are fundamental on such
questions as the federal government’s role in
civil rights and the committment of the United
States to international organizations in general
and the United Nations in particular. '

A Republican Party led by the Arizona Senator
would be reduced geographically to sectionalism
and philosophically to anti-federalism. To the dis-
gust of Lincoln, the Grand Old Party would become
a haven for racists; to the dismay of Roosevelt, it
would obstruct the government’s efforts in social
and economic reform legislation; and to the disap-
pointment of Eisenhower it would advocate a nar-
row nationalism in international affairs.

The great failure of Dwight Eisenhower in the
1950’s was his inability to translate personal popu-
larity into Republican strength; but will history
remember Eisenhower as the man who abdicated
moral and intellectual responsibility in his party’s
most dangerous hour? Noninvolvement at San
Francisco next month will secure foriDwight Eisen-
hower a, position with the weak sisters of Presi-
dential history ~— with Buchanan-, with Grant, and
with Harding.

General Eisenhower remains the only ﬁgure-who
can unite the moderate elements of the Republican
Party in its attempt, not merely to block Barry
Goldwater, but to preserve its‘ traditional prin-
ciples and policies in the face of the reactionary
challenge. . .

Instrument Society

‘To Sponsor Course

The Instrument Society of America (ISA) will sponsor
a ﬁve-day Intermediate Level Short Course on Gas Chroma-
tography. The course,. organized and directed by the An-
alysis Instrumentation Division of ISA, will be held in Pitts-

burgh, Pennsylvania, from November 30 to December 4,’

1964. Mr. T. .I. Kehoe, Director of the ISA Analysis Instru-

mentation Division, is acting as Course Director. The purpose of this
course is to provide advanced training in industrial applications of
gas chromatography for working engineers and other technical peo-
ple who have daily. responsibility for process and laboratory instru-
mentation. - ’

Each day of the course wil offer morning lectures and guided
afternoon discussion sessions. Evenings will be left open for inde-
pendent study and informal discussions.‘ All group sessions will
be held in Skibo Hall on the campus of Carnegie Institute of
Technology. Residence arrangements will be provided in the
near-by Webster Hall Hotel.  '

Each of the lecturers is a well-known authority in the field of
chromatography and either is presently engaged in Lmiversity teach-
ing or has held professorships during his career. Among those in-
vited to participate in the short course are: R. L. Pecsok, University
of California at Los Angeles; W. D. Cooke, Cornell,University; J. C.
Giddings, University of Utah; D. M. Rosie, University of Delaware; S.
R. Lipsky, Yale University; C. H. Orr, Proctor and Gamble Company;
and Stephen Dal Nogare and J. J. Kirkland, both of E. I. du Pont
de Nemours and Company.

The goals of the course cover the thedry and applications of
gas chromatography. Since the course is designed for those who
are already familiar with chromatographs, demonstrations of
actual equipment will be omitted. Each registrant for the course
will receive a bound set of the course lectures-

The Instrument Society of America, recognized as a leader in
reporting GC research, has sponsored four biannual research con-
ferences in gas chromatography during the years 1957 to 1963. Realiz-
ing that a continuing service can be rendered in the ﬁeld of chroma-
tography, ISA has developed this course for practicing chromatog-
raphers seeking additional information on applications.

Advance registrations are now being accepted. Detailed informa-
tion on course registration can be obtained by writing:

System in Use on Mesabi
Hercules Co. Develops
New Flogel Delivery

_ The Explosives and Chemical-Propulsion Department of
Hercules Powder Company has developed a new and highly
successful technique for delivering ‘ Flogel (Registered
Trademark of Hercules Powder Company), a slurry-type
blasting agent, to a site and loading the material into holes.

The new method, which has been used over the past
year on the Marquette and Mesabi Ranges, utilizes a tank truck,
capable of carrying approximately 20,000 "pounds of Flogel «in liquid
form which is taken to the blasting site and pumped through hoses
into the holes. During the pumping, an agent is added at a metered
rate to produce’ thevrequired consistency. The pumping system also
accuratelymeters out the amount of material used in each hole by
weight. A

moving the truck, as the hose has a length of 80 feet and each truck
has two hoses. Thetrucks are able to pump between 250 pounds and
500 pounds per minute under normal circumstances. P
In loading the holes, the hose with an aluminum nozzle-like
addition is lowered into" the hole and the slurry is pumped
through the hose under a steady pressure, thus achieving a uni-
form'ﬁlling of the hole to the desired height. The new method
cuts the time of loading a hole in,half and provides‘ better break-
age of rock, with subsequent savings to the mine pwners.

Hercules now has two trucks on the road making deliveries.
The trucks load with Flogel at the plant site, deliver it to the mines,
load the holes, and, if needed, go to a support truck trailer, also
loaded with Flogel, and reﬁll to complete the job.

Under the new system, Hercules is able to assure the mine cus-
tomers the high quality control, obtainable only under plant con-
trol procedure, improved consistency in hole loading compared to
former methods, time savings on actually loading the holes, and
subsequent savings on mine equipment and time due to the superior
breakage achieved by this type of shot.

This system eliminates the old method of manually lowering
blasting charges down each hole and minimizes, also, problems
formerly encountered in holes with’ water in ‘them. Flogel, having a
higher speciﬁc-gravity than-water, displaces the water upward in
the hole.‘ In cases where there is a water flow through the hole, a
long sleeve of plastic is put over the hose and lowered with it, along
with an initiating device, subsequently being ﬁlled with the Flogel
and expanding‘ to ﬁll the entire hole. A -

The new system permits the loadingof a battery of holes without-

The company , will compensate
engineering students submitting‘

new ideas for special _rules and
slide charts which the company
decides may be marketable” in
specialized areas. ‘ f 

“The purpose of the program"
is primarily to promote en-“

gineering and math study, and. 3...

atthe same time, to encourage
students to improvise with their
slide rules and to suggest chanig,-’
es or innovations,” accordingfto
John Pickett, President of the
firm. A

“There is a great need for spe-
cial application slide rules and
charts because of the highly tech-
nological aspect of nearly every
industry, large or small. We be-
lieve that college engineering stu-
dents, because of their combina-
tion of specialized study and
large interest range, can be of
great assistance in devising un-
usual computational instruments.
One of the major theories behind.
the program is that these slide
rules will enable people to accom-
plish greater computational pro--

~jects in a shorter time,” he added.

Additional information and ap-
plication forms may be obtained.
