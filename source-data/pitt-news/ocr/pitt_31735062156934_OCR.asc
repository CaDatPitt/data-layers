To soothe the savage beast, the

i p Incorrect Appeal 

‘Pitt’s proposed independent association

started off on the right foot when -they asked

Citcom’s president Ken Hall to speak here a
few weeks ‘backs. Since, they have moved def-
initely left in policy.

Hall stated that an independent organiza-
tion loses all semblance of appeal when its
prime objective is to oppose the fraternities.
He further urged that an independent group
should push more activities for the streetcar
student. He is right.

The Pitt independent group seems to disa-
gree Withithe president of the only successful
Citcom Clan on Tech ’s Campus. They disagree,
in part, with a former leader of their move-
ment here.

Since the ﬁrst organizational meeting, the
old, hard-bitten, mud throwing anti-fraternity
block has made itself more and more pr-gominent.
Under present conditions, there is little chance
that they will get‘ by the University ’s strict or-
ganizational gode because of this group.

The Pluebell-Davis-Rozanski combination
had hoped for a worthwhile group. They are

competent leaders and could make a go of it-
But, they haven ’t been able to stem the tide of
the anti-everythings.

It’s a sure bet, that unless these men are
able to move into their rightful positions as
leaders of the group and guide ittoward worth-
while aims—principally, providing the inde-
pendent student with avsocial life, a way into

\activitie.s—-the independents Won’t be able to

plant the seed, let alone, be nipped in the bud.

‘N0 Homework Please

At Pitt we have meatless Tuesdays, eggless
Thursdayswhow about a homeworkless Christ-
mas vacation. Many students are confronted
with holiday studies which dampen the holiday
spirit, before classes are actually adjourned.

This “overtime” is brought about by slow

starts at the beginning of terms, and attempts '

at covering more material (by unyielding pro-
fessors) than allotted time permits. '

The slow starts are necessary in most cases
for general familiarization, btit trying to cover

‘ texts in their entirety is useless when it comes
‘ to retaining all that information—even for a__ P

semester ’s duration.

 _'Vacation studying offers moreof a problem
to those who ﬁnd the time advantageous for
earning some expense money. And for the work-
ing student in’ general, and the working family '
man in particular, studying is practically im-
possible. Certainly they wouldn’t object to a
homeworkless holiday——_-———nor would the rest
of the ‘student body, and some professors,

Approcich to Student

 Governing Groups?

by Bill Veenis

One basic need of college campuses and
their governirg procedures in general has
loomed evidently lacking. They aren’t real.

From beginning to end, the entire pro-
cedure of college set-ups has been to sheild
the student from anything that might stem of
politics. For this reason, unless they have an
unusually well informed home life, the college
kid is nothing more than a college kid.

Why do the administrations and student
groups try to hold the hard facts of local, na-
tional and international political life from the
unprotected eyes of the student?

From the very beginning,’ college student
governments are not permitted to conduct
themselves in anything resembling our own na-
tional or state assemblies. The way they are
elected is on a “goody-good” principle instead
of a real political election.

Why not elections with all of the trim-
mings? Primaries and primary, campaigns——
then general elections with a concerted drive
by parties to elect men or women who stand

on party planks. —

As to actual powers of the student groups,
the ‘individual campus should‘ solve its prob-
lem. One thing. is certain, if a student‘ govern-
ing. body is to govern, it should have the pow-
er .to do so. That it should ‘delve into strictly
administration problems is out. of the question.
It should, however, have the right toisettlc,
without fear, ‘problems confronting the stu-
dent body. It should be able to act.

   

 Christmas Chapel Services
— Festive’ and Impressive; \

Dr. Hugh Kerr, Speaker

Heinz Chapel invites you to its special Chﬁst-
mas Service. Tomorrow at 12:40 p. m. the doors
open to perhaps the most festive and most im-
pressive of the year’s student services.

Guest speaker Dr. Hugh Thompson Kerr, for-
mer pastor of the'Shadyside Presbyterian Church,
now executive-secretary of the. Pitcairn-Crabbe
Foundation, will center his discussion around the
theme, “Carrying Religion To Victory.”

A feature of the service is the procession of
the Altar Guild. Guild -members, under the —di-
rection of Mrs. Edna T. Batz, director of the Pitt
YWCA, bearing candles and -wreaths of the season
to decorate the altar, are followed by the proces-
sion of the chapel choir.

The music for the service includes Dr. Finney’s
original composition, “One Elect. Of Stars,” the
fourth in 5 series of anthems inspired by the win-
dows of the Heinz Memorial Chapel. Based on the
theme of the “Come All Ye Faithful” window, the

icompositiorfs lyrics were written by a former choir

member,‘ Doris Jack. An Appalachian Carol, “Jesus,
The Christ Is Born” as arranged by John Jacob

‘Niles, will also be included in the program.

The Student Leader is Opal Mary Wetzel, and
Frederick W. Lotz will act as chapel organist in
the absence of Dr. Griswold.

Climaxing the service, an offering, the proceeds
of which will be given to Pitt in China, will be
taken by the ushers. ‘ ‘ ‘

Pat Eldridge Takes
Atanticlnd Honor

Take a warm day in the summer, a small boy, and a ki. 1
ten, and what do you get? Pat Eldridge, a senior in the Col
lege, combined these elements last year and gnade a story 0

   
   

them——a story which won ﬁrst honorable mention in the 1946-
1947 Atlantic magazine -contest for college students.

At ﬁrst, Pat wasn’t so enthusiastic about this as you
might expect her to be. She thought her story was way down I.

on the list. “But when I found
that it really meant second place,”
she says, “I felt much better.” ‘

Blonde, vivacious Pat, who is
one of Pitt’s chief exponents ”of
the principle of perpetual motion.
was last year a reporter on the
Pitt News. This year she is con-
ﬁning her leisure time to writing,
not stories, but “Very bad poems
and medium essays.”

Like many successful writers,
she gives much of the credit to
someone else — Mr. Edwin L.
Peterson,_ her instructor in short
story writing last year. “My story,
_‘Never Tell,’ never would have

won without Mr. Pe_tersan’s guid-
ance,” she maintains. -

This praise is not altogether
unfounded, since four other stu-
dents who wrote under Mr. Peter-
son’s direction placed their papers
among the top entries in the com-
petition.

“A Fugitive Moment,” by Lois
C. Watson; “Gift to the Madon-
na,” by Alice Slome; and “The
Chalice,” by Elisabeth Doty were
listed among the best ‘stories.
“Stone Is My Fetter,” by Har-
riett Roberts, was one of the best
poems submitted.

Alumnus Misses
Most of College

What does college mean to you? What is it going to ‘mean to. you
when you look back on it with an alumnus’ perspective? Stop and
consider for a moment, then read the article“ below. It’s something

to think ab out.

I met a man once who said:

I missed out on my college days. You see, I didn’t enter
into it quite all the way. I was afraid, I guess. I wanted to try
for a part in the school play once, but I didn’t. I intendedto.
I went up to the room the night they were reading the parts,
but I didn’t go in. There were so many there who could do it
better than I, and I turned away and went down the hall. I

wanted to try for the footba11¢

team, too, but I told myself I was
light and turned away from the
practice ﬁeld. And, it’s funny; but

do you know I can’t go to see a’

football game now, or hear one
on the radio, and I can’t go to see
a college play, because I see my-
self out on the ﬁeld or on the
stage as I might have been if I
hadn’t been afraid. And I I ﬁnd
myself -wishing I could go back
to college to live those days over
again.

I met a man oneewho said:

I missed out, on my college
days. You see, I didn’t enter into
it quite all the way. ‘Working my
way through school took all my
time, or I told myself it did. The
fellows used to go bumming
around at night and sometimes
they’d ask me along, but I never
went. I always told them I had to
study. It seemed to me a lot of
foolishness, the way they used to
hang around the college drug
store, or loiter on the library
steps, or go to snake dances or
rallies. I even missed the football
games. Froth, I called it. Wasted
time! I was in schoool to study.
And, it’s funny, but do you know
I turn . away now every time I
see a group of college men gath-
ered in a drug store or on a cor-
ner of the campus. ‘And every
time I see two old college chums
slap each other on the back and
say, ::Remember the time we
.” I gulp a little because I

o a

missed out on all that, and I find.

myself wishing I could go ’ back
to‘ biiegé to live those days..over

I met a man once "who said: V

I missed out on my college 
days; You,see, I didn’t enter 'intO.,,, i
it quite all the way. When ‘I went
there I wanted‘ to meet the one _
girl, and I wanted to fall in love.

I wanted, toﬂdream dreams with
her and make eternal pledges.
But I read a lot of ‘things about
the “romantic fallacy.” And about
the “facts” of love and marriage.
And some of the other fellows
said, “Love is only‘ sex.” They’
said, “You’ve got to behard about
these things,” and they. gritted
their teeth on the word “hard”
and went in for sex. I lg; myself
believe them and became hard. I
threw away "the dreams and the
pledges. And then one day I met
a girl. She would havegbeen the i

dream girl, but. I didn’t ‘believe in

dream girls. “Pm hard,” I said, i.
And gritted my teeth. ,“Love is,
only sex,” I said and went in for
sex. I didn’t entw into love all the
way. And aim at perfection. I
married another girl, and have at
family now. But I missed out on .
all the dreams and pledges. And,

it’s funny, but do you know that
every time the wind blows across

Steal Show

By Pat Seg'er_

It’s all over but the engraving.
A new class mark will be etched
on the women’s sing cup right
below the inscription merited last
year by the class of ’47.

Besides a win-drunk sophomore
class, the 1947 Interclass Sing
leaves in its wake a fractured cur-
tain in the YW—YMI—lA auditor-
ium, a few dozen cracked ear-
drums, and a blurred picture of a
none-too—academic Pitt of tomor-
row. -

Seam-splitting event of the
afternoon was a skit featuring the
judges. Five members of the fac-
ulty and administration took the

pins out of their hair to present 1

their version of Pitt umpteen
years hence.
Dr. Auleen Jamison was there

Russell was there in grey ﬂan-

bonnet. Eyes‘ centered on Miss
Helen Pool Rush in her slinky red,
hula tiered gown. Dr. Warren
Nystroni faded into the background
in his wrinkled grey ; suit and
Warped,-to-match-the-head hat.

In order of mention, these mem-
bers of the judging board repre-
sented respectively, the girl stu-
dent, the athlete, the dean of.
women, the male student, and the
professor of tomorrow.

winning sport, chess. ,

Crawling to the middle. of the
stage, the male student of tomor-
row stammered and recited a dit-
ty about “ . . . why’I’m no idiot;
a moron, that’s me!”

The dean of women of 1962
slunk to the front of the strange
assemblage, puﬁed strenuously on
a king-sized‘ weed. At the same
time, the dean danced and .sang
office hours
on the lawn in spring.”

The dean no sooner ﬁnished her
song when Dr. Jamison rushed

up and snatched the cigarette
from her hand. This did not dis-

courage the Miss Rush of 1721962.
She lighted another Weed and
commenced dancing with Dr. Ny-
strom. Once again, Student Jam-
ison pulled out her whip and
lashed the dean for dancing four
inches closer than Miss Post
rules.

Time came for the professor of
the future to sing his tune about

classes.” The profs -warped hat

Congress Plans
Petition Debates ‘

Is it or is it not good?

That is the question that will bepresented to the student
body for ﬁnal decision. The question: shall the membership on
Student Congress be changed from seven men and seven women

to ten men and ﬁve women?

At the last meeting of Congress a motion was passed to

have Men’s Debate Club hold
the student body, for information
about the amendment.

For two reasons this should be of
interest to all students. One, the
voting on this amendment will
take place the day after the de-
bate. If students do not know
what the issue is all about, this is
a ﬁne time to ﬁnd out. Two, this
will be the ﬁrst chance for the
student body to see Pitt’s cham-
pion debate team in action. _

, In the past most students didn’t
know what they were voting for
when they decided on an amend-
ment. By having the ‘debate Con-
gress hopes to inform the students
so that they may vote intelligent-
ly.

There will be no judges, the ﬁnal
decision will be left to the in-
dividual students. They may ques-

-tion the debaters after the debate

if they wish.

In charge of the affirmative side
will be Frank Blackstone, the neg-
ative side will be led by Dave
Rhodes.

The debate will take place in
room 324 C1 on Monday, Jan. 5,
during the ﬁfth hour.

 

Pittsburgh ranks ﬁrst in the
United States in rail tonnage. Its

ﬁve Class I railroads have carried
as high as 169,338,862 tons in a
single year, nearly seven times
greater than the Panama Canal.

der. That's exactly what it did as
the judges strolled from the stage
to take their places in the judging
sector of the auditorium. By the
time the task of judging skits was
before them, all lost dignity had
been regained. A /'

The skits themselves were ter-
riﬁc. The freshmen sounded like
40 Pennsylvanians. The sopho-
mores combined at Virginia
O’Brien-type character with Pat
Leix in an Atomizer, and there
was the Pitt of tomorrow. The
winning scheme was done in the
fashion of a radio program.

Judicious Mixture of Courses

Asked by Illinois President

A trend to less specialization in higher education, and to greater if

understanding of related subjects, is being chartedat the University
of Illinois, -according to President George D. Stoddard.

He outlined an educational pattern which would consist of a
central core of specialization, b-ut also include related studies without
a sharp dividing line between them. , '

“To crowd a curriculum with specialities is to guarantee that

other areas will be neglected; to‘?

fail to develop a single speciality
following it through to advanced
levels of understanding is to sell
the student short.”

Stating that every large uni-

versity has suffered from the fault

of too great departmental special-
ization in teaching, he said that
reports are already available here,

and discussions under ‘way to
overcome this weakness.

“There is no sharp dividing line
between specialized and related
subjects. The student should feel

equally at home in both. An en-

gineer studying English has not",

left the ﬁeld of engineering. Po-
etry is not ‘written for other poets;
it is written for everyone.”

Schenley Roorn Due to.Undergo
Creek Transformation on Interior

The Schenley room won ’1; always be a room full of nothing‘

as it is now. The lack of ‘plaster and exposed beams you saw
when you had your X-ray taken will soon be replaced by Greek
pillars and mirrored walls, because the work of dismantling,
moving, and restdring the ballroom of the Croghan-Schenley

home is now lin progress.

The ballroom and its annex, the oval room, came from Pic

nic House, which was built byﬁ

William Croghan, Jr. in the early
1800’s as a Pittsburgh home for
his daughter and her British hus-

,band, Capt. Edward Schenley. It

stood on Stanton Heights, and was
listed in the directories of 1837
as “the country estate of William
Croghan, Gentleman.”

Mary Croghan Schenley inher-
ited Picnic House at her father’s
death- in 1850, and although she
lived there only ﬁve years, it
became generally known as the
Schenley House. After 1850 the

only occupants of the old house
were the caretakers, the family
of Mary ‘Croghan’s childhood
nurse. The Schenleys made sever-
al visits but these were infrequent
and brief.

In 1945, the land on which the
house stood was sold to William
S. Miller, who -gave the University
permission to removethe struc-
tural details of the original rooms.
Funds for the project were pro-
vided by Mr. George Hubbard

Clapp, president of the Board of

Trustees of the University.

In addition to being a memo-
rial to the good taste and reﬁne-
ment of the early Pittsburghers,
these rooms have a historical and
architectural signiﬁcance. They
are among the ﬁnest examples of
the Greek Revival style in Ameri-
ca and are the most important
achievement in this style in West-
ern Pennsylvania. 

Fi,ne carving detail of the wood-
en Corinthian capitals and door-
ways, freestanding columns, _mir-
rored walls, and curved niches
and doorways will be some of the
features of the Croghan—Schenley
ballroom. In the original room the
exterior windows on one side
correspond to false windows on
the other." The false windows have
sliding sashes which conceal doors
leading to other rooms. The chan-
delier, which is also being restor-
ed, is oversize, with crystal and
bronze ﬁtting for candles.

William Croghan’is original in-
tention was that Picnic House
should'be used for entertainments
and good times. When the Crog-
han—Schenley ballroom is com-
pleted, Pitt students will see to
this. Present plans for the room
say that it will be used for small
parties and informal teas. which
are ordinarily held in the Com-
mons Rooms. ‘

Reaches Peak

WASHINGTON — College en-
rollment for the 1947-48 school
year reached the record total of
2,338,226, almost a million more
than the pre-war peak of 1940
and 260,131 more than a year ago,
the Federal Security Agency an-
nounced today.

Included are 1,122,738 veterans
of World War II, of whom 24,091
are women. Veterans comprise 48
per cent of the total enrollment.

The 1947-48 freshman crop of
592,846 represents a sharp de-
crease from last year’s record of,
696,419 beginning students.

..The ﬁgures were compiled by
the agency as a result of a survey
of 1,753 schools--every institu-
tution of higher education on rec-
ord in the country.

The returns showed that New
York had the highest student to-
tal, 280,874, followed by Califor-
nia, 178,663.;" Illinois, 163,725;
Pennsylvania, 142,280; Ohio, 142,.

WASHINGTON (UP) — The»

university students of government.

The Washington study group has
settled again in the capital for
four months of close contact with

ing the advantages of reality with
classroom theory, according to Dr.
Paul Jacobsen, head of the po-
litical science department at Col-

The group includes eight vet-
