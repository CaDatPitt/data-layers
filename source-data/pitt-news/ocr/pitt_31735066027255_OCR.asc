Sam Brunsvold, a 36-year-old campus
minister from the University of Pittsburgh,
was gunned down in a drive-by shooting on
Tuesday around 10:30 p.m.

He was shot in the head near Wellesley
Avenue, Highland Park, after he got out of
his car and began walking to his home. A
passerby saw him on the ground and called
the police. Brunsvold was taken to
University of Pittsburgh Presbyterian
Hospital where he was pronounced. dead.

“We have no suspects, no motives, no
leads, and we are conducting a thorough
investigation as we look into every lead,”
said Police Sgt. Pa11l Marraway of the East

Liberty Bureau of Investigations.

Brunsvold had left the Wrlliarn Pitt
Union, where he was leading an evangelis-
tic bible study, at 8 p.m. He was at a leader-
ship meeting at his church for the Christian
Student Fellowship until 10 p.m., according
to Kim Keller, a junior at Pitt who was
interning with Brunsvold.

“Sam left the church at 10:10 p.m. to
drop students off and then headed home.
Arormd 10:30 p.m., while his wife Sherri
was putting the kids to bed, sheheard a gun-
shot and went outside to see the commo-
tion,” Keller said

Students at the University of Pittsburgh
and Carnegie Mellon University who were
connected with the CSF had various reac-
tions whentheyheandwhathadhappened

to Brunsvold.

“My ﬁrst thought was the kids and
Sherri, how they would be affected by this;
where the ministry would be going; well-
being of household, Christian Student
Fellowship, and its direction,” said Kate
Decker, a junior at Pitt.

Students could not even concentrate on
their studies. “I went to class and couldn’t
think about anything else, so I came to the
chute ,” said Terri Cooper, a Pitt freshman.

Other students said that their faith was
helping them cope with the tragedy.

“I felt really sick and had to sit down. I
am still in shock I am relying on scripture
right now, [as it] applies to the fact that Sam
is not with us, but we can believe he is with

allegations

Ali R. Abdullah

 

From April 1986 to March 1996, 678

Pittsburgh police ofﬁoers had complaints of

brutality ﬁled against them, and of those
oﬂicers, 59 had ﬁve or more charges ﬁled
against them

Basedlon the City Cont1oller’s report,
over the last 10 years, 1,674 similar com-
plaints have been ﬁled against the police in
total.

The allegations and the acquittal of
John Vojtas in the case of the death of Jonny
Garnmage has many Pittsburgh citizens
demanding a civilian review board to hold
police accountable for their actions.

In the last four months, City
Councilman Sala Udin has sponsored seven
town hearings to debate a proposal that
would establish such a review board.

The ﬁrst debate took place June 17,
1996, at the A. Weil School. The hearing
contained 18 total speakers. Those in favor
of instituting a review board outweighed
those opposed to it 17 to 1. The following
debates also demonstrated an overwhelming
majority of people in favor of the board.

Janera Solomon, president of Pitt’s
Black Action Society, said she was in favor

University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center assimilates North Side Hospital

Merger necessary to maintain quality, says spokesperson

Matt Stock

 

The corporate juggernaut
of the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center is
continuing to create a net-
work of health care institu-
tions spanning western
Pennsylvania.

Wednesday, the UPMC
announced its plan to enter
into “formal merger discus-
sions” with Passavant
Hospital in the North Side.
For the UPMC, it is not an
altogether surprising
announcement, as the past
year has seen them form
mergers with several other
hospitals in the city and its
surrounding areas, including
South Side, Beaver, and
Braddock hospitals. The area
north of the city has been the
only region that hasn’t been
reached by their influence.

“What we’re doing is

establishing a presence in-

the North Hills,” said Jane
Duffield of the UPMC news

WEATHER

bureau. “Since it is a grow-
ing area, it is necessary for
us to make that presence
known.” A

Under the agreement,
Duffield said Passavant will
retain its entire staff and
board of trustees, but will
gain the benefit of expansion
through the UPMC’s vast
resources.

As far as the UPMC
making its presence known,
and using this presence for
leverage in future merger
negotiations, Duffield would
only say that “the UPMC
wants to build a network of
quality health care through-
out western Pennsylvania.
As you add quality institu-
tions, you can develop syn-
ergy.”

Ironically, while the
UPMC was in the process of
merging with other area hos-
pitals over the past year,
Passavant maintained its
stand as an independent hos-
pital in the midst of the
UPMC’s dealings.

However, remaining an
independent hospital was no
longer possible, according to
Passavant representative
Robyn Beckwith.

“The changing health
care environment has made
it necessary to evaluate our
future,” she said. “In today’s
heavily managed health care
market, no community hos-
pital can stand alone.”

But such competition
could mean serious trouble
for hospitals such as
Allegheny General, which
also operates in the North
Side and is Passavant’s chief
competitor.

The merger may result in
some extensive expansion at
Passavant that could make
Allegheny suffer in terms of
patient admission. Such
competition, according to
Beckwith, is not the main
point of the merger.

“The issue is whether we
can provide a high level of
service to the community,”
said Beckwith.

PITTSBURGH —— Pittsburgh—based
Westinghouse Electric Corporation is sell-
ing its Oak Ridge, Tennessee nuclear waste
processing company.

The deal with GTS Duratek
Incorporated is worth nearly $30 million.

The sale furthers Westinghouse’s intent
to get out of the environmental services
business as part of its strategy to divide into
an industrial company and broadcasting
company.

Westinghouse’s scientific ecology
group is the largest commercial radioactive
waste processor in the nation. ‘

GTS, based in Columbia, Maryland,
converts radioactive and other hazardous
waste into enVironmentally—safe forms.

PORTLAND, Tenn. —- Some enterprising
bank robbers in Tennessee used a stolen
wrecker to rip a drive—through automatic
teller machine from its foundation, getting
away with thousands of dollars stored
inside.

Police say a farmer found the wrecker
and the emptied ATM in his ﬁeld yesterday
morning, several hours after the theft.

An alarm alerted police when the ATM
was snatched from its dn've—through lane.
Officers checked the building but didn’t
realize that the cash machine had been
taken. Police say the oﬂicers followed the
proper procedure for checking the building.

The video camera stored inside the
machine managed to catch the theft up to
the point where the culprits pulled the
device out. The FBI is now going over the

Concerns about the difficulty of
acquiring Student Activities Fee fimds
have led to the creation of a resource cen-
ter to guide student groups through the
complicated allocations procedure.

Complaints about the large amount of
paperwork previously required caused the
Student Government Board allocations
chair Noelle Campagna and Terrence
Milani of the student activities oﬁice to
streamline the process and create the new
resource center to provide human guides
to assist applicants through the maze of
red tape.

“Before, if a student came up to the
[SGB] office, they would have to spend
time tracking down an allocations [com-
mittee] member to help
them,” said Campagna.
“Now, there will
always be somebody
with the
information they
need.”

Aside from pro-
viding more people to

Student Organization
Resource Center
(SORC), located on the
first floor of the
William Pitt Union, will have many other
functions.

Student groups will be able to track
the status of their budgets throughout the
semester by computer. They will also be
able to complete the certiﬁcation and the
officer registration portions of the process
from the computer.

The center will provide applicants
with several other services as well. All
basic copying for organizations will now

-be run through the SORC copier, and

groups will be able to fax and mail at a
monitored level.

Computer accounts for certiﬁed orga-
nizations are also available, allowing
members to created a web page and access
e—mail. SORC itself hopes to have a web
page that provides information about
every student group.

All of these activities were previously
scattered about several different locations,
if they existed at all. The SORC center is
expected to change that.

“SORC came about due to the avail-
ability of several components, those pri-
marily being the necessaiy ofﬁce space
and the students to staff it,” said Milani. “It
provides the Office of Student Activities
an excellent way to combine several ser-
vices in one location. This way we will be
able to create even greater opportunities
for efficiency.”

These are not the only differences in

New center eases allocations
process for student groups

the allocations process. Student organiza-
tions, with the exception of those with
governance status, will no longer have to
ﬁll out the recruitment and meeting forms.

The funding they once provided was
often used to purchase newspaper ads or
to provide food at a recruiting event. As
long as a group is certiﬁed, $325 is avail-
able to them for these purposes, the same
amount they would have received before
—— sans paperwork.

The removal of those types of forms
is expected to save both the allocations
committee and the student groups elfort
and time.

The travel forms have been redone in
a new, uncomplicated format. There is
now a separate form for ﬁeld l1‘lp funding
for expeditions that reﬂect an organiza-
tion’s interests, as well as a form for par-
ticipation in national or
regional conferences.

Groups will
now have a separate
sheet to apply for new
funding allocations for
. membership dues in
national organizations
and insurance. The old
system included no
procedures for those
needs.

“Those two
items tend to be essen-
tial for some groups to operate, as well as
communicate, on the national level.

.Without them, these organizations would

have a difficult time existing,” said
Milani.

Campagna also said she and Milani
are continuing to work on a solution to the
problem of sports club funding.

Currently, they are in the process of
receiving information from the groups as
to what their total funding needs are. Once
the research is completed, they plan to pay
for certain activities and materials that
individual members of those clubs for-
merly had to pay from their own pocket.

In an effort to further maximize the
use of their computer resources, the SGB
will attempt to place the allocations forms
online by the end of April.

Students will be able to ‘access the
forms through the SGB website. They will
still have to submit a hard copy of their
work, but should have an easier time com-
pleting the necessary paperwork from
their personal computers or a Pitt lab.

While all these reforms take place on
a procedural basis, the SGB continues to
look for ways to improve its decision-
making system as well.

“Our number one goal is to make the
process as easy and as fair as possible,”
Campagna said. “With these improve-
ments and continued research, we hope to
do just that.”

Around ie wold and back to SGB

Board member brings inlernaiionaléexperience lo Pill‘

 

Student Government Board mem-
ber David Teeters has more on his mind
than University politics.

Back this school year from study-
ing abroad, Teeters clearly remembers
his experience backpacking across 40
different countries with four Pitt pro-
fessors and 20 other Pitt students.

” Out of those 40 countries, Teeters
doesn’t know which is his favorite.

“Maybe China or Russia. The cul-
tures are sodifferent [from ours],” the
junior said.

When asked which
course he has liked the
most since coming to Pitt,
he says the study abroad
experience has been by far
the most enjoyable for
him.

“You don’t realize that
you learn,” he said. “It
was an invaluable experi-
ence.”

One such experience
that Teeters remembers
happened while in Turkey,
when he was able to wit-
ness a 5 a.m. Islamic call
to prayer.

“Most people don’t
get to see that kind of
thing,” he said.

Teeters is interested in
many things outside of
SGB and world travel. As
a neuroscience/politics
and philosophy double-
major in the University
Honors College, he has
been able to participate in
other life—enhancing activ-
ities as well.

As a new volunteer in
the operating room at
Presbyterian University Hospital,
Teeters has seen the most technical
aspects of surgery.

“It [surgery] is nothing like ‘ER.’
The doctors know what is going to hap-
pen ahead of time, so there isn’t all the
frenzy associated with an emergency
room,” he said.

Upon graduating, Teeters would
like to go into international health and
development as a career, combining
both the policy analysis and medical
aspects of his education.

This decision came to him while
studying abroad. His love of medicine
combined with his political knowledge
and background were two reasons
behind his pending career choice.

“The number of people I saw suf-
fering from basic health issues was
tremendous. They lack basic immu-
nizations,” he said.

 

“The saddest for me to see was
probably India, to see people die right
in front of you. But they don’t just die
that way. They have lived their whole
lives like that —— in filth.”

Back in America, Teeters is a
returning member of the University’s
crew team. He began rowing his fresh-
man year.

“At the first practice of my fresh-
man year, the coach said we were
going to go on a ‘ﬂat run.’ I naturally
thought ‘ﬂat’ meant ﬂat. It didn’t,” said
Teeters. Now though, Teeters really
misses those hills when he returns to
his hometown of
Cleveland, Ohio.

“Ohio and Pittsburgh
are really similar towns.
But Cleveland doesn’t
have those hills.”

Another activity
Teeters participates in here
at Pitt is teaching a reli-
gion course on Monday
evenings to sixth graders
from local public schools.

“They [the kids] call
me ‘Mr. Teeters’ and ask
me how many kids I
have,” he said, laughing.
“I even got Christmas pre-
sents this year. And I had
to schedule parent/teacher
conferences. I hated those
growing up. Now I am on
the other side,” he said.

Through teaching this
class, Teeters says that he
has gained much more
respect for teachers.

“It [the class] really
isn’t a religion course, per
se,” Teeters said. “I try to
be a role model to these
kids, more than teaching
them religion. Values are
taught less today, so these
kids need that.”

Through his travels, Teeters has
seen that other countries, whether they
be Islamic, Jewish, or Christian coun-
tries, have an important central system
of beliefs and teach those beliefs as a
way of life. “These beliefs might not
necessarily be religious, but they have
a set way of believing,” he said.

When he returned from his travels,
Teeters chose to live on-campus in the
dorms, mostly because, he says, he
couldn’t really choose off—campus
housing while he was away. I

“I’m looking forward to living off-
campus. But I like being on-campus
also. I came to college to experience it
all. I am in the middle of everything if
I live in the dorms,” he said.

At the pace Teeters is currently
moving, he should hit “the middle of
everything” pretty quickly.

Review
of such a review board because it would
give the public a stronger voice in investi-
gating oﬂicer misconduct.
“I think people are tired of not having
a say in the way police oﬂicers treat peo-
ple,” said Solomon.
The review board would act as the
official body for investigating any incidents

or allegations of police misconduct. If ir1sti- A

tuted, it would be composed of seven
Pittsburgh residents, appointed by the
mayor. Several speakers at the debates said
the members should also reﬂect the city’s
ethnic and cultural diversity.

Along with its investigations, the board
would also possess the power to subpoena
witnesses and advise police on training
procedures, as well as gain a voice in the
hiring of new oﬂicers.

But this board will not exclude input
from city police oﬂicials.

“I think the people making and enforc-
ing policies should come from within the
police department as well as from citizens
within the community,” said Solomon.

The Review Board would also moni-
tor the mayor’s appointees to ensure the
board is diverse.

But Commander William Valenta, of
the Pittsburgh Police Chiefs Bureau, said
he doesn’t believe the past record of the
city oﬂicers warrants a review board.

“I think police officers will enforce the
law the way they’re supposed to and do it
well regardless of any instituted body,” said
Valenta.

reviewed, not only locally, but also by state
and, if necessary, federal bureaus of law, he
said. According to Valenta, the Civilian
Review Board would be superﬂuous.

But supporters of the board contend
that they are not satisﬁed with those proce-
dures and want a new board that will over-
see these operations.

Valenta responded to these statements
by saying, “I think now things will change
since we have a new chief. Chief [Robert]
McNeilly is a disciplined chief and does
hold oﬂicers accountable for their actions.”

But supporters claim that a Review
Board can do more than discipline officers.
The group aspires to take part in police re-
education, training, and counseling.
VV1thout the Review Board, citizens say,
there is no middle ground between the
community and city police.

“I think our voice should be heard
when the time comes to sit down at the
table to discuss police misconduct mat-
ters,” said Tonya Payne, an administrative
assistant in Udin’s oﬂice.

Udin’s oﬁice has been the main spon-
sor of the Review Board for a little over a
year. Members of Udin’s oﬂice say they
are hoping the Review Board will be insti-
tuted as soon as possible. In the upcoming
city election, voters will be able to decide
whether the board will become a reality.

“I feel the Review Board will beneﬁt
the entire city, not any particular group,
because the abuse has crossed over all
lines: racial, sex, and gender, the young and
old,” said Payne.

Aimee McCrady, a Pitt junior.

Another student also felt disoriented by
the news.

“I was confused and very surprised and
very concerned for everybody he had an
impact on, especially the family and ki ,”
said Keith Stitely, a senior at CMU.

Keller said that this was like something
from a bad dream.

“When I first found out, I did not
believe it for a couple of hours. I sat and
wondered when I would

mare. I spent the day
walking around the
church, not believing,
thinking any moment
Sam would walk around
and come pick at me,” she
said.

Brunsvold was
employed by the Christian
Student Foundation of
Pennsylvania and was a

former chairman of the University of

Pittsburgh Association of Chaplaincies. He
started and led the Christian Student
Fellowship on the Pitt campus.

“New Hope Christian Community was
started because of the vision Sam had to
reach out to college students,” Keller said.

Brunsvold was involved as an Elder at
his non—denominational church, New Hope
Christian Community on North Dithridge
Street.

Before his death, Brunsvold started the

Christian Student Fellowship, comprised of
approximately 40 students, and the New
Hope Christian Community Church, which
is comprised of 120 young adults.

He also initiated the Schenley Project, a
tutoring program at Schenley High School.
It combines academic tutoring with a‘
Christian youth group. The youth group is
led by Keller. The students are taught about
real-life scenarios and how to deal with
them.

Brunsvold was also involved in com-
munity outreach in his
own neighborhood.

Recently, the student govem—
ment board held a town meeting in
order to give students a chance to
meet the board and speak their minds
on various campus issues .

This ﬁrst round suffered from
the standard opening night snafus. At
the same time, there were a number
of students there who did get up and
bring issues before the board. Despite
thefactthatthis was acarnpaign
pronrise fulﬁlled (kudos to Marquette
Bownran), the students did not need
to hear the stump speeches again.
The board has been elected, they
should take‘ stock of what they’ve

heard, and alter their agendas appro-
priately.

This was not people debating the

issues of national politics. When the
students ﬁnally got to speak their
minds, they were concerned about
the things that affect them immedi-
ately. Concerns about student health,
food services, and transportation all

were expressed Campus issues were

occasionally overlooked during the
campaign and are still at times.
The student participation was a

ts. at "1 59

 

   

positive thing, but is had one draw
back. Bob Harkins, director of park-
ing and transportation, did not speak

until after 10 p.m. This was because _

he was scheduled after the open
ﬂoor. Although many concerns were
expressed transportation and student

fees are major concerns to students. It
was only after the majority of the stu-

dents had left, however, that Harkins
armounced he would be asking for a
transportation fee hike of 335-6 per
term for full-time students and $2-3

enthusiasm!

for part—time students. The real news
came in after the crowd had gone

I out.

In the future, the board says that
the meetings will be thematic.
Students should hold them to that.
They also ought to ask that the board
re-schedule its meetings from
Wednesday nights at 9:30 p.m. to
make them more accessible for stu-
dents.

This is a board with much ener-

‘ gy and enthusiasm. It is up to the stu-

Ways to get along in the workplace

 

David & Joan Green really
know how to say thank you. Ready.
The owners of Prirnex, a gardening
supply store in Glenside, PA., want-
ed to express their appreciation to
their employees for the everyday
diligence and hard work they per-
form. Simple handshakes weren’t
enough. Pats on the back were

passé.NotevenaCokeandasmile~

would suﬂice.

The only logical thing to do?
How about treating every employee
and his family to an all—expenses-
paid weekend vacation at Big
Boulder & Jack Frost ski resorts,
theﬁrstweekend of 1997?Canyou
say, “WOW”?

As employees zipped up color-
ful snowsuits and fantasized about
Winter Olympic gold medals on the
beginner slopes, the Greens scored

perfecttensintlreadmirationcate-‘

800’-

Under the silver dollar sun of
Corporate America, it’s a relief to
know that, amidst big bosses and

_ constant quests for quick capital,

there are a few who recognize the
labor behind the loot.

The ernployer/employee con-
nection has been less than stellar.
There’s a never-ending mind game
being played with both sides con-
fused about the rules. Bosses are
supposed to bark out orders and
obedient workers scarnper away in
fear, right? Or employers are
required to stand back and watch
employees mingle by the water
cooler taking advantage of the
employer’s kindness, right? Wrong.

There’s nothing wrong with
letting people know who’s the head
cheese. Obviously, boundaries must
be drawn between employers and
employees to stress that work
comes ﬁrst. But somewhere along
the line, the communication is hor-

ribly distorted, leaving mixed sig-
nals.

Some employers use their
positions like drugs, getting high off
power. I must admit, there is soure-

I thing about having the power to

makeorbreakalackeyonthespot.
But resorting to Mr. Spacely
“Jetson, yoouu’rree ﬁred!” tactics is
cruel.

Employers never realize the
gold mines they possess in their
employees. More employers need
to view jobholders as assets, not
expendable. There’s more to work
than hiring and ﬁring.

However, not all employers are
ogres in disguise. Many employees
have a habit of juicing employers
for their kindness. I’ve been in
many an ofﬁce and witnessed
employees huddled in dark comers,
in “I Hate My Boss” support
groups, exchanging ﬁivolous boss
frustrations like baseball cards.

“I can ’t believe she asked me to
call this, analyze that, type this,
check that  what does she expect
me to do, work?”

Some employees automatical-
ly expect their bosses to be
ruthless, overbearing, and intimi-
dating, which means the boss’ true
colors are never noticed.

So what can be done?

The main key is respect. In the
workplace, people need to respect
each other. Employers have to
remember two important things: 1.
that they were in the same position
at one point, and 2. most jobs suck
If given the choice, most people
wouldn’t be doing the mundane
routines they perform 365 days a
year. They’d be taking the boss’
place, making his money, and dri-
ving his car.

Employers also have to learn
how to show authority without
ﬂashing it in employees’ mugs.
They know who the boss is by the

signature on the paycheck

Employees, don’t take advan-
tage of a boss who’s given you
more than enough kindness. You
didn’t have to be hired, and there’s
always someone looking to wear
thosewingtipsorsteeltoesyou
usedtoweartoworklfsonething
to throw back a few brews with
your boss after work, but propping
your feet up on his desk the next
morning and looking through his
wallet is pushing it.

Get to know each other just
enough so you feel comfortable
witlreachotlrer.'l‘lreonetfrringI
could never fathom is the boss that
doesn’t know the names of his or
her employees. When I worked at
Modell’s Sporting Goods, I waited
for the big kahuna to come and
shake my hand for selling his
sneakers and foot spray. No dice.

All that’s'required are two little
words, “Thank You.” Or how

A Who's worse off, Iron Mike or football?

 

Fine, the St. Louis Rams went out
and hired Dick Vermeil away from TV.
Bill Parcells graced the tube with his
presence before he took the New
England job. Even Bill Walsh dabbled

in NBC—land before going back to the
49ers as an incognito assistant watch-
ing from the heavens of the press box.

But the latest leap by a TV guy
back to the coaching ranks is more ludi-
crous than, let me think, allowing Terry
Bradshaw to speak about Mike
Webster’s butt during Fox’s Super
Bowl pregame monotony.

Mike Ditka was on top of the world
with the Chicago Bears in the rnid-’80s.

Thursday, January 30, ‘I997

In 10’ seasons with Da Bears he won
112 games and lost only 68.

Then alcohol and stress helped him
become the type of parasite that sports
has become so famous for in the ‘90s.
Gee, Ditka was setting the pace for
hooligans of the future when he tried to
attack a fan in Tampa Bay or how about
his sideline detonation on Jim
Harbaugh in ‘92. The faltering coach of

The Pitt News: How has your
“overall experience been here at
Pitt? '

Robyn Senior: It’s been a great
experience. I’m from Pittsburgh. I

never really expected to go here ‘

[Pitt]. I never really wanted to. At
the last minute, things fell through
with other schools and I decided
to go here and it’s been the best
experience of my life. I’m close to
home, if I ever need anything
there. I love my teammates. I love
my major [Engineering]. Overall,
I have no complaints except that
I’ve lived here my whole life.

TPN: What other schools did you

_ think about attending?

RS: I was looking at Rhode Island
for gymnastics.

TPN: When you decided to come
here, Pitt gymnastics wasn’t as
successful as it is now. Why did

_ you come?

RS: I’m not sure exactly. The rea-
son I wasn’t looking here was
because I thought I was going to
Rhode Island, so when [Pitt
Coach] Debbie [Yohman] came
in and was looking at seniors in

, my gym, I told her I was already

going somewhere [Rhode Island],
so I never really got recruited.

TPN: Due to NCAA Title IX,
men’s gymnastics was dropped.
How does this make you feel?

RS: Its easy for me to say it stunk.
I didn’t want to see them leave.
We were all pretty close in the
gym. We all worked out together
all the time. I understand Title D(.
I’m not complaining that they’re

trying to make things equal, but
when it happens to a team that
you’re that close with, all of a sud-
den you don’t want that to hap-
pen, either.

TPN: How often do you practice?

RS: The practice schedule is 2:30
to 6:30 p.m. for four days a week
and then it kind of varies, depend-
ing on the meet schedule and we
lift two days a week also. Our
whole team’s in the training room
at 1:30, so it’s really 1:30 to 6:30
p.m. plus lifting in the morning.

TPN: How have you seen the
team improve over your four
years here?

RS: It’s been a total turnaround.
The people that we started off
with, like Lori [Buck] and myself,
we’re the only two out of ﬁve
freshman that started with us. As
far as the recruits we’re getting in,
it’s just taking us to a whole new
level. The ones we have have
stayed consistent and kept
improving. We’re just getting so
much more talent coming in;
that’s what it takes. You’re going
to improve a little in college, but it
has a lot to do with who you get
from the start and we’re getting
some of the best recruits in the
country.

TPN: Do you attribute that to
Coach Yohman?

RS: Yeah. Definitely our coaches.
Debbie [Yohman] and [Assistant
Coach] Steve [Craig], both of
them. They’re great coaches any-
way. Lori and I have stayed
healthy and we’re still competing
for the team even though were

 

Robyn Senior nearly packed her bags and went to Rhode llnd.

getting all these recruits. They’ve
kept us at our level, if not better,
for the past four years.

TPN: What motivates you to get
up and practice every day?

RS: [Laughing] I have no idea. I
ask myself that every day.
Gymnastics is a sport where you
don’t see too many people that
run around like ‘I love gyrrmas-
tics,’ especially when you’re
older. All they do is complain
about it and about how bad we’re
hurting. Its kind of like an addic-
tion, though. You can’t imagine
not doing it, but whenever you’re
doing it, it’s like, oh man. The
meets are great, competition is
great, but practices are a pain in
the butt.

TPN: You are a senior. What do
you plan on doing after gradua-

ime y Pitt»

 

don?

RS: I’m not going to graduate this
year, so I’ll be in school another
year. Hopefully, I’d like to volun-
teer and help out with the team a
little bit whenI’m out of school.
I’m not thinking anything gym-
nastics coaching—wise. I’m going
to go straight into engineering and
hopefully get a job in that.
Eventually, I think I’m going to
want to come back and do some
coaching on the side, but not right
now. Not yet. ‘

TPN: Gymnastics seems to be the
only women’s sport which draws
a lot of fans. Why do you think the
men’s sports draw so many more
fans than the women’s sports?

RS: A lot of the fans that do go to
the games are men, and the foot-
ball and basketball is a big com-

  

son goes at a time. For us, it’s a
big rush of adrenaline, but for the
people watching it, unless you
enjoy the sport, it’s kind of hard to
get all fired up.

TPN: What do you think of hav-
ing some of the meets this year at
Fitzgerald Fieldhouse instead of
having them up at Trees Hall?

RS: I like it because we get pretty
packed up there [Trees Gym] and
we’re going to have to start tum-
ing people away if we keep cram-
ming in there, but I like the Trees
atmosphere because when all the
people are in there, it feels a lot
more crowded. Whenever we go
to the Fieldhouse, the same

amount of people take up only '

one set of bleachers. The gym’s a
lot bigger, but I love the
Fieldhouse. The only thing I
could say negative is that it does-
n’t feel as crowded but I don’t
have a problem with it.

TPN: Do you act any differently
than in previous years because
you are a senior veteran leader on
the team?

RS: Not really. In general, I’m still
the same person. We’re all moti-
vated. It’s not like Lori and I have
to hit everyone and say ‘come on,
get going.’ There have to be one
or two people that make sure
everyone keeps that attitude and
keeps their spirits up, so we’ve
done that more this year than last
year or the year before whenever
we were a little bit younger and
there were other older people to
keep us up. In that sense, yes, but
everyone already has great atti-
tudes and are very motivated so
it’s not much work for us to do.

People always say records
are made to be broken, and
that’s what the Panthers did
last night as they rocked Notre
Dame 88-64 at the Civic Arena
in front of 13,240 fans.

The Panthers set school and
Big East records by hitting 16
three—pointers. Pitt knocked
down 7-11 from three-point
range in the first half, and the

bombs kept falling in the sec—.

0nd half as they hit 9-11.

row. Now that we have every-
one back, we are playing
extremely well,” said Hea
Coach Ralph Willard. 1
Jason Maile led Pitt by hit-
ting five consecutive threes in
the second half to put Pitt up
74-43 with nine minutes to
play. Backcourt mates
Vonteego Cummings and Kellii
Taylor didn’t disappoint from
beyond the arc, either.
Cummings made all four of his
attempts in the first half, and
Taylor was four for six on his
way to a career—high 20 points.

shooting is great right now,”
said Cummings.

It wasn’t just the shooting
that routed Notre Dame; the
Panthers excelled in every
facet of the game.'They held
the Irish to 33 percent shooting
in the second half and just 18
percent from three-point land
for the game. Pitt’s quickness
didn’t allow the Irish to get
many open looks at the basket,
and when they did, center Mark
Blount was there. Blount had

Lacly Panthers give
game away at ’Nova

 

Pitt’s women’s basketball
team dropped to 2-8 in the Big
East with a 54-40 loss at
Villanova last night.

The Lady Panthers turned
the ball over 36 times. It’s
tough to win when you cough
up the ball that much.

The ﬁrst half proved to be
Pitt’s downfall as they com-
mitted 2l of
turnovers.

Vi1lanova’s strong defense
smothered the Lady Panthers’
offense. Pitt managed only 18
ﬁrst—half points. This is the
sixth opponent the Wildcats
have held under 50 points. In
addition, they are 9-0 in allow-
ing 60 or fewer points.

Pitt could not even man-
age one bucket in the ﬁnal
5:09 of the ﬁrst half. The fact
that Pitt shot zero percent from
the foul line did not help
either.

The Lady Panthers went
into the locker room down
only seven, but Villanova went

their 36.

on a 20-7 run after the break to
take control of the game.

Pitt made it close by going
on an 11-3 run to close out the
game, but they still lost by 14.

Latia Howard and Missy
Thompson hit for double fig-
ures in the loss. They scored
14 and 11 points, respectively.
Jenn Beisel hit for a game-
high 16 points to lead the
Wildcats.

Shanette Lee missed a
school record by one steal as
she racked up eight over the
course of the game.

The only bright spot for
the Lady Panthers was that
they controlled the glass. They
out-rebounded Villanova 46-
27, but it did not help.

Pitt also dropped to 7-14
overall. Things will be very
tough in the future as they will
be going into the Big East
Tournament with what looks
to be a sub—.'500 record.

The Lady Panthers will try
to bounce back Saturday,
when they travel to Rutgers

before returning home for two

games.

Panthers: Shooting 3s and taking names

At the beginning of the
season, many cynics
thought the Panthers would
have to rely on their inside
game most of the year.
Their perimeter shooting
was seen as questionable at

‘ best.
That theory has
changed throughout the

course of the year, and it
was crushed last night at
the Civic Arena.

Pitt made history in
their 24-point drubbing of
the visiting Irish as they
knocked down a school-
and conference—record 16
three-pointers. The
Panthers shot 69.6 percent
from beyond the are (16-
23). The previous school
record was 14 in a game.
That feat was reached three
times, most recently on
Feb. 18, 1995 against
Georgia.

The Big East record
prior to last night’s barrage
had been 15, set by both
Miami and Georgetown.
Freshman Jarrett Lockhart’s

 

triple with less, than four
minutes to play put Pitt into
the record books.

To no one’s surprise,
senior sharpshooter Jason
Maile was 
the highlight 
of the 
Panthers tar-
get practice.
After manag-
ing only two
points in _the
first half,
Maile caught
fire in the
second half,
hitting all
five of his
three-point
a t t e m p t s

   

Pitt with a game-high 20
points, made four of six
three-point attempts.

Notre Dame Head
Coach John McLeod spoke

  

within a 

four-minute  Varga got

span.  into the
Vonteego 1 mood last

   

Cummings got Pitt started
early by hitting four of four
bombs in the first half en
route to 16 points.
Cummings finished the
game with 19 and, you
guessed it, the final three
points came from beyond
the arc.

them to hit them.”

“Since the return of Blount,
Taylor and Cummings are able to
be more aggressive on defense.
They know if they
make a mistake
Blount will be
there, and he can
erase a lot of mis-

takes,” said
Willard.
Taylor and

Cummings were
terrors on the
court. When Notre
Dame missed,
they were running
the break before
the Irish could get
back, which led to
wide—open shots.
They were all

bined nine passes.

“Our young guards are really
learning how to control the game.
Their ability to hit their shots has
opened up the inside, which is

what I want,” said Willard.

With 7:15 left in the first half,
a three by Cummings sparked a
16-6 run to put Pitt up 43-29 at the

half. Starting the
second half, Pitt
ignited for a 28-12
run to go up 7I-4].
To start the run,
Taylor knocked
down a three and
then stole the
inbounds pass for
an easy 1ay—in.
Three minutes
later, Kevin
Willard inbounded
to Blount for a
nasty backboard-
jolting alley—oop
that shook the
whole arena. Then
Maile went on his

personal 15-2 run to knock the
Irish out for good.

“When we come out and play
hard like we did tonight, we win.
Right now I think we can beat any-
one in the country,” said Maile.

what was arguably the best team ever to
grace the NFL sod, the ‘85 Bears, lost
his touch and his cool and moved onto
analyze games from a safer spot. The
friendly confines of the NBS refugee
camp in New York.

Ditka was living the good life at
NBC. He had his buddies Joe Gibbs,
Ahmad Rashad, and Greg Gumbel at
his side. He had a fly leather jacket
courtesy of Brandon Tartikoff. He had
quality time to spend with Beasley
Reese.

Why then, at the age of 57, did he
decide that coaching the New Orleans
Aints was a bright career move? The
former Pitt and Dallas Cowboys prima
donna tight end has nothing to prove by
ﬂoating down the Mississippi to the
not-so-Superdome sidelines.

Aints management says that
they’re excited about the number of
fans Ditka will put in the seats in New
Orleans. Ditka says “I’m going to
climb the mountain one more time. I
might fall on my butt, but it’s going to
be done.”

This move could be hari-kari for
the big guy. Many of his peers are ques-
tioning the move as well.

Personally, if I were Iron Mike
Ditka I wouldn’t have taken the job in
New Orleans.

I wouldn’t even take that job if I
were Iron Mike Sharp.

The Aints are pitiful.

The Aints have had five winning

 

 

seasons in their 30 year existence.
Their fans are well known for wearing
paper bags to protect their anonymity.

The Aints simply ain’t good.

Ditka has been known for his fond-
ness for gambling, especially on the
Mississippi Riverboats, and even on the
links with another Chicago sports per-
sonality. Needless to say, the stakes are
probably higher than NFL sheriff Paul
Tagliabue would like to see in his town.
In fact, the governing body of the NFL
prohibits any gambling period.

Good luck to Aints GM Bill
Kuharich in trying to stop Ditka from
gambling. Maybe they can sway him
by giving him a handful of beads and a
trolley trip to Bourbon Street for a cou-
ple weeks during Mardi Gras.

Word on the street is that Iron Mike
has cleaned up his volatile act of years
past. He has gotten off the bottle and
even found some inner peace via the
Lord.

Maybe Ditka has changed for the
better. He will fill seats in New
Orleans. And he’s always good for
some controversial statements about
football and life in general.

But when your new head coach
sheds tears at the press conference to
announce his new position, I’d think
twice about what I’ve gotten into. Ditka
had even admitted that after he agreed
to the terms of the Aints job, he thought
to himself, “What am I doing?”

Parcells will have to get permission

The Big Tuna had reportedlyplanned

Well on one hand, it could
describe the WPTS Concert Bash
this Saturday, February 2nd. The
free, all-ages show kicks it live
with bands like The Johnsons,
Dielectric, The Others, and The
1985. However, if you ask these
bands how they describe their
music, they would have few
words to offer. When I asked them
what made them tick, I got a lot of
eccentric philosophies on what
has driven these bands to musical
therapy. From misunderstood
childhoods to young feminist
movements to boring hometowns,
these young bands express them-
selves through variations of

None of these groups are in
music for the money or fame.
They don’t have big labels push-

throats, yet who they are plays an
important part in their music. So
who are these people who rebel
against_ labels and stereotypes?
After spending a week exploring
these bands, I realized that the rea-

people before was because they
were the freaks my sorority sisters

so painful. Rebellion and social
disgust is the name of the game in

 

the punk geme and The 1985 does
a lot of it. Hanging out with these
guys, I found out what it means to
have an awkward painful place
inside of myself.

“1985 is a place that we all
lived through and will live through
again,” said bleached-babe gui-
taiist/vocalist Joe. “It’s the ﬂux of
trends we all live through again
and again. You never change. You
are always within yourself, so
where you are now is where you
were in 1985. It’s a constant state.
I’m not getting beat on and I don’t
hate my parents anymore, but it’s
still 1985.”

“It’s getting in touch with that awk-
ward painful place within yourself. Webster
would deﬁne pain as a warning. You know
it’s your body’s natural warning signal,” Joe
said.

“But I like pain,” I said.

“You like pain! Well, very good. We
actually go to great lengths to cause great
pain. One of 1985’s goals is to keep every-
body in touch with that To be able to
say ‘aw, this is where you were. Remember
this? This sucked!’”

One of their favorite pastimes is yelling
profanity at people to see what their
responses will be. “We want to piss people
off. I want to get in people’s face with my
music,” said Joe, the talkative one.

When asked if they considered them-
selves “indie,” I was met with a vigilant
protest at being coined with a term that
doesn’t seek to describe what a band is
about.’

Joe: “We don’t like the word
indie.We’re very against the word indie.”

John: “It doesn’t exist.”

Joe: “Indie essentially means anything
put out by a label. Which could be any-
thing.”
Jelf: “The old guys in McKeesport
singing in a choir could put something out
and be called indie.”

Joe: “We’re a punk rock band, and
that’s what it boils down to. We don’t have
mohawks or leather jackets, but we’re
punk.”

I have learned that being punk is about
keeping in touch
with one’s inner
child. A lot of
music is composed
from just playing
around with the
sound and singing
as loud as one can.
After my seven-
year-old brother,
Stephen, listened
to The l985’s band
practice, he said he
could sing in a

I had to take Stephen with me when I
went to take photos of the band. 1985 got a
kick out of playing with my little bro since
they seem to be in the business of releasing
adolescent aggression. Now I fear my
brother will turn his ﬁrst grade class into a
punk revolt.

Young bands are on the rise and The
Others are a perfect example. Lucy, Werner,
Allen, and Mike all had to ask their parents
if they could come to Pittsburgh and play.
Hailing from Washington, D.C.’s colorful
youth scene, The Others are still in high
school. I talked to Lucy over the phone
about what made her forget about football
games and pick up a guitar.

“Riot Grrrl pushed me a lot,” said 15-
year-old Lucy. “I saw other girls doing it
and I thought I could do it too.”

 

  

I 3 THE PIT NEWS Thursday, January 30, 1997

FROM PAGE 17

The Riot Gnrl scene evolved as a fem-
inist punk movement in 1989 that fought
the stereotypes of female musicians.

“I read about it in ‘zines in New York
City when I was in seventh grade.” said
Lucy.

Young bands are starting young and are
not a new thing in most big cities like D.C.
What is surprising is that The Others are
really fresh. After hearing the “Sweet
Something” track on their seven inch put
out by Duchess ('Il1scadero’s label) I was
deeply impressed with their energetic riffs
and wailing vocals.

The Others were asked to come to
Pittsburgh for WPTS’s show after they
opened for Velocity Girl in D.C. Lucy says
that she was so nervous playing for 900
people that the audience was talking to her,
trying to calm her down. Well, she couldn’t
have done too bad, because I have only
heard rave reviews about the show.

The Johnsons, on the other hand, are
secretive guys who were only available to
tell me that their music is “Rickety,” and is
catered toward insomniacs. Come to the
show to ﬁnd out if these guys will keep you
awake.

The guys from Dielectric are WPTS’s
homegrown band. Paul, Chris, Luke, and
Jason are the children of the fourth ﬂoor

William Pitt Union who refuse to be labeled"

as indie also.

Chris: “If anything, we’re a rock
band.”

Luke: “I don’t want the band to be
‘ deﬁned in any specific
category. I mean we’re
just rock’n’roll. We
play music people lis-
ten to.”

Chris: “We’re
probably inﬂuenced
V by the same inﬂuences
that Karl Hendricks
j and TransAm are into,
not necessarily inﬂu-
enced by them.”

S Karl Hendricks. And

 

is not to sound like any speciﬁc band.”

These collegiate guys are part of the

‘80s generation that listens to a menagerie

of different artists from Echo and the

Bunnymen to the Smiths. I wonder if their
music is a reﬂection of what they were like
in 1985. This might explain why they con-
sider their music to be more instnrmentally,
rather than lyrically, driven. Watching Luke
play his bass while jumping up and down

on a chair, I can see why they consider I

themselves a live band.

Paul: “I get more into playing guitar
rather than the vocals, but that could change
tomorrow. I’m a guitarist.”

Paul has also had a hand in putting

together the show on Saturday that will end ,

a 3-year drought of live University shows

The Insteps
Eleven Steps to Power
Another Planet/Stubbom Records

Black to White, Brooklyn to Long
Island, the music of Jamaica bums like a
blunt in New York City. For almost a decade
and a half, that most unholy of words —
“ska” — has been a beacon of hope in an
often overrated New York music scene.
These, however, are the nineties, and the
American melting pot has turned into a vir-
tual car alarm, a ﬂagship of the postmodern
condition, and thus, the nineties have turned
to California — for CULTURE, of all
things! '

Tragic Kingdom is the massive unit-
mover from Californian ska—inﬂuenced pop-
sters No Doubt The very title refers to
Disneyland, refers to the Blade Runner
California that is so much more than a
movie. This is from whence the term “ska”
has entered the American vocabulary, and it
doesn’t need to be so, Rude Bwoy!

Invading the airwaves with pre-apoca-
lyptic, end-of—the-millenium ska, reggae,
and rocksteady are Brooklyn’s Insteps,
who’ve ﬁred on the Babylon that is the mod-
em ska scene with a salvo of revolution
ammunition. Come, my selector, come
now! Bring down the enemy with Eleven
Steps to Power, out on Another Planet
records, with the aid of legends of roots rebel
ska, Stubbom Records. Eleven Steps to
Power contains eleven tracks of music
steeped like Tea (and no Djarling, bay—bee)
in Jamaican popular music, without stagnat-
ing in the ska period like so many bands, or
bastardizing it into “—core” or “-punk” deriv-
atives.

The record begins with the call of leg-
endary Jamaican toaster King Stitt, and
kicks into “The Dragon,” a soul/go—go
experiment that shows olf the talented musi-
cians in the Insteps, especially drummer
Eddie Campo (sometimes loaned to label-

mate posse Stubborn All-Stars) and the
saxltrumpetltrombone , horn section.
Somehow, the track even holds in check the
guest appearance by King Stitt, who’s toast-
ing one would expect to overpower the
instrumentations.

From there on out, we’re treated to the
double vocals of Noah Roy and Peter
Loshak, who seem to have blended into one
style of phrasing and breathy, low—key soul-
singing. VV1th mad lyrics concerned with the
conditions under which we live in this mod-
em age, written, like all parts of the music.
with an eye on what has come before, it is
perhaps these Siamese vocals that are the
most lacking point in the record. There may
as well be one singer. The styles are so sim-
ilar, and at times the melodies can blur
together through the tracks. Still, songs like
“The Sufferer” and “Every Slacker Is A
Star” are on a level achieved in ska by few
bands —— Insteps buddies Slackers and
Skinnerbox being among that elite.

“I will pour the gasoline/Down on the
hotter ﬁre/Witness the hour the wicked
lease/on Earth shall expire/Brimstone talkin’
prophet squawking/Fussin’, Moanin’,
Bitchin’/If you can’t stand the heat broth-
er/You best get out the kitchen.” Heavy
words, written under heavy manners. The
Insteps get points for Reggae-esque
Revelations in their revolutions, and for
mighty music grafted onto the unsuspecting
public by their organ/soulero guitar/drop
bass/drums/horns/vox lineup. If you’re
expecting to hear four guys with new distor-
tion pedals expound the virtues of skinhead
girls and cheap beer, look elsewhere; if you
want a little irie with your ska, take the Steps.

Check out the Insteps live tonight with
D.C’.s Eastern Standard Time and locals
the B-3 ’s and the Sussed at Charlies Bistro,
Forbes Ave, across ﬁvm Palumbo Center
7:30 pm, All Ages. Riddim Rielin ’!

Jack and Jill

Presented by City Theatre
Directed by Marc Masterson
Written by Jane Martin

Jack and Jill is simply one of

the best performances I have
seen in my ﬁve years of theatre-
going in Pittsburgh. Julie Fain
Lawrence (Jill) and Joseph
Adams (Jack) portray a contem-
porary romantic couple that

encounters the painful realities of

trying to combine their lives.

This isn’t a Romeo and
Juliet—type production, and this
isn’t a simple story. Adams and
Lawrence talk to the audience
during the duration of the play in
short monologues that articulate
the thoughts of each character,
adding an intimacy to the story.
The audience is able to peer into
the anatomy of an impossible
relationship. In a society stricken
with an increasing divorce rate,
making a relationship last isn’t as
easy as ﬂipping on the TV.

The troubled lives of the
characters were so exhaustively
examined in the first act that the
play could have ended there.

What makes this show extra-
ordinary are the performances by
Broadway actor Adams and
actress Lawrence, who bring a
painful realism to the story. The

sensitive scenes between the
characters ﬂow naturally, getting
personal with the audience.
Adams has played roles on pop-
ular daytime dramas like “Days
of Our Lives” and “As the World
Turns.” Lawrence did her
groundwork in drama at UCLA
and Yale.

Together, this couple shows
us the unexarnined aspects of
relationships. Walls are built and

Blonde e ea

“Symphony of Treble” b/w “Kasuality” ‘

Touch and Go

The new Blonde Redhead seven-inch
is pretty. It looks like my grandma’s liv-
ing room with the puke green couch,

golden recliner, and rust orange curtains. .

You know what I’m, talking about. If it
had those furry, round, frilly things bor-
dering the sleeve, it would make for a
ﬁne, sofa pillow. '

I have to admit, I was really worried
that songs would never be able to live up
to the brilliant quality suggested by the
packaging. Fortunately, I was wrong.

“Symphony of Treble” opens up with
just that. Meandering keyboards and
high-pitched feedback start the chaos.
Soon, the keyboard is replaced by a
whimpering trumpet backed by a tight
rhythm section that holds it all together.
Supported by calmly staggering vocals
by the guy (I’ll probably get his name
wrong because I always confuse the
vocalists. You decide: either Amedeo or
Kazu), this song can do no wrong.

The B—side is much the same but with
one advantage — super—sweet vocals by
the other singer (again, your pick). For
those of you who aren’t already aware,
the sounds emanating from her mouth are
those of an angel, albeit one in a bit of
pain. Soft, cuddly words of a six-year—old
slowly transform into sustained screeches
that could shatter windows at full force.
This sounds sexy in a way one seldom
imagines something “sexy” would sound.

The record follows the band’s second
LP La Mia Wta Wolenta on the Smells
Like Records label. It is deﬁnitely worth
having, along with their first on the same
label, if you like Sonic Youth and the
vocals described above. For those who
care, the seven—inch was produced by
Guy Picciotto from Fugazi and is the first

release for Touch and Go. If you already.

dig them, you will definitely dig this, as it

takes their sound one step further in an

undoubtedly positive direction.

Various Artists
The Rebirth of Cool Four
4th & B’way

It’s hip to like acid jazz.

At least that’s the word around town.
Just look around, and you will see “acid
jazz nights” popping up at clubs every-
where.

It’s the newest craze in music ... only
it isn’t new. Acid jazz has only come into
vogue recently with promotion by big
name labels for groups like US3, Massive
Attack, and Portishead.

Even more well known rap acts, such
as A Tribe Called Quest, the Beastie
Boys, and the Jungle Brothers, have
helped promote acid jazz by experiment-
ing with different types of beats and
styles —— melding other genres with their

 

   

 

own. In fact, these groups have all made
appearances on the Rebirth of Cool
series.

With the fourth edition of the Rebirth
of Cool series, it is clear that acid jazz has
been around for a while and even clearer
that it isn’t going anywhere.

The proof of this can be found in the
fact that even in four years, the music of
the Rebirth of Cool series has evolved.
Not to say that the other three were infe-
rior; volume four just speaks wonders
about the creativity that drives the artists
behind the acid jazz scene.

Of course, the term “acid jazz” is
much like “altemative” in that it doesn’t
really exemplify the music it names.
“Altemative” used to be just that — an
alternative to the mainstream. Now it is
mainstream. Likewise, “acid jazz” came
from the melding of acid house beats and
jazz instrumentation. Now it stands for a
perplexing mix of several different gen-
res.

Take the first track of the album,
“Underwater Love” by Smoke City. It’s
far from jazz, lying somewhere between
ambient, the “James Bond” theme, and
Portishead. It starts the album out with an
overall feeling of sensuality that inches its
way into most of the tracks.

While a more traditional hip-hop
sound seemed to rule most of Volume
three, and volume two took on a jazzy
feel, this new version takes a look at the
ambient beats. Only, this is not ambient
music — each artist puts his own twist on
the genre, giving it the exotic mix that has
become familiar to acid jazz fans.

Still, like the previous three volumes,
there are definite hits and misses, though
there are more hits than misses. “Claire,”
by iO continues the feel, providing a
groovy little tune with a pinch of ambient
noise. It is probably the best track on the
album.

The most unusual, however, is the
effort by Outside, dubbed “To Forgive
But Not To Forget.” It melds techno
house beats with a soothing violin solo.
Think of it as a Russian orchestral version
of the latest Prodigy tune.

Not to be outdone, De Lata gives an
interesting mix of Latin and techno beats
with the song “Pontelo.” Only Lewis
Taylor’s “Bittersweet” truly disappoints.
After a great start, it slowly devolves into
a sickening mix of guitar—happy riffs and
bad R&B vocals.

There is little of what you would con-
sider “jazz” on the latest Rebirth of Cool
volume. Akasha’s “Jazz Garage” proba-
bly comes the closest, yet it still uses a
ﬂute over more traditional horns.

Overall, the album still remains fair-
ly close to its roots. While it may not
sound like traditional acid jazz, it is obvi-
ous that each track shares a common base
and expands on it. It is a wonderful con-
tinuation of an excellent series —— one
that mirrors the continual growth of the

music.

The Heiress ,
Playhouse Theatre Company
directed Larry John Meyers

Henry James wrote down bits and
pieces of late-night gossip in 1879 about
love and its entanglements, and then pro-
ceeded to produce a novel out of that gossip
entitled “Washington Square.” Suffice it to
say that the novel remained in relative
obscurity until Ruth and Augustus Goetz
decided to make it into a play and call it
"Ihe Heiress.” Fortrmately for the Goetzes,
“The Heiress,” a story about midwinter love

and all that follows, successfully ran on .
Broadway and encouraged a movie version _

which won 4 Oscars in 1949. Recently,
“The Heiress” was revived on Broadway
and won a 1995 Tony Award for Best Play
and featured a wonderful Cherry Jones in
the lead role of Catherine Sloper.

. The Playhouse Theatre Company at
Point Park College is currently staging “The
Heiress” under the direction of stalwart

Point Park—er Larry John Meyers. Meyers.

was “interested in the complex relationships
that occur in the novel and how [he] could
bring that to this production.” The story
revolves around a dominating and success-
ful Dr. Austin Sloper(John Amplas) and his
beautiful but timid daughter, Catherine
S1oper(Marie Elena O’Brien). Dr. Sloper is
interminably resentful of Catherine’s birth
(which caused the death of his wife) and is
conspicuously abusive towards her. Though
she is a captivating and prepossessing
young woman, she can do nothing to please
her father. Catherine’s aunt, Lavinia
Penniman(Sheila McKem1a), steps into the
scene and tries to encourage Catherine to
break out of her shell when she meets a
charming man named Morris

iTownsend(Brett Kennedy). Catherine,

being foolish and young, is immediately
smitten by Morris. Since Catherine is an
heir to her mother’s fortune, however, Dr.
Sloper thinks that perhaps Morris is only
after Catherine’s fortune — how very excit-
ing!

The story does get a bit non—soporiﬁc
near the end of the show when the charac-
ters break out of their Victorian molds and
shapes and start doin’ the Macarena! Just
kiddin’. In all seriousness, the story does
pick up momentum and displays a rare (for
the 18005) sensitivity for women’s expecta-

tions and roles. The lead role of Catherine is
written with thoughtfulness, albeit in a
somewhat limited fashion, and the Goetzes
account for her condition and her person
without thoroughly conforming to what a
Victorian woman should be. Catherine goes
through some rather intense positive
changes. This is indicative of her strength,
something women are rarely seen as pos-
sessing in this historical period. '
— Although I previewed this show rather
excitedly, I must admit that perhaps the text
isn’t strong enough to uphold the kind of
overall intensity that I was expecting. The
intensity of performance was certainly up to
the standard that I have come to expect from
all Craft Ave.-related theatre events, but the
text itself is, for lack of a better term, stale. I
maintain that the show achieves some rather
bold statements concerning women, but the
writing itself is simply not as thoughtful as
one would expect. Catherine falls in love
with the ﬁrst man she has the gumption to
talk to, and I have a hard time believing that
a woman experiencing her turmoil is that
simple. Regardless of my feelings on the
Goetzes’ writing, I applaud the overall work
of the show. Marie O’Brien, as Catherine,
displays a rather mature presence on stage
and seems quite comfortable within her
leading status. Brett Kennedy as “loverboy”
Morris has a rather striking Alec Baldwin
quality about him, and I am almost ashamed
to say that I liked it. He created a pretty
believable kind-of-too-passionate-
boyfriend—guy character but sometimes
when he smiled he was just a bit too hand-
some. Sheila McKemra and John Amplas,
as Aunt Lavinia and Dr. Sloper, respective-
ly, were respectable; Amplas, especially,
was so “there” that he was almost scary.
Hopefully, readers won’t be swayed by
my liking the statement of the show, hating
the text, and liking the acting. Is that even
possible? At a school as dedicated to quali-
ty as Point Park, it certainly is possible to
deal with all the aforementioned crap and
still come out on top with a good show.
“The Heiress” is playing at Playhouse
Theatre of Point Park College, 222 Craft
Ave, Wed. thru Sun., at 8 p.m. along with a
Sunday matinee. Fri. and Sat. shows $18
and all others $16. Students can purchase
rush tickets ( half price ) half an hour before
showtime. Call 621-4445.

because the special effects didn’t work right
at the time. (See related story below.) The
Empire Strikes Back and Retum of the Jedi
will also be rereleased in special editions, in
February and March, respectively.

And, of course, since Lucas has a sense
of the dramatic, the special editions are being
released in 1997 to coincide with the 20th
anniversary celebration of the original release
of Star Wars —— and also to whip audiences
into a frenzy of anticipation for the upcoming
all—new Star Wars ﬁlms, which have been in
preproduction for well over a year and are
expected to hit theaters beginning in 1998.

Toward the millennium

Lucas has kept the speciﬁcs of the next
trilogy top secret, but the basics are no secret:
the new ﬁlms will chronologically precede
the original Star Wars (officially, Star Wars is
labelled as Episode Four, “A New Hope”),
and will tell the story of Luke Skywalker’s
father, Anakin. The ﬁrst movie will feature
the character of Obi—Wan Kenobi as a young
Jedi Knight, and will relate Kenobi’s first
meeting with the child, Anakin. The second
chapter will illustrate Kenobi’s training of

 

Anakin and their adventures together in the
Clone Wars. The conclusion will detail
Anakin’s fall to the forces of evil and eventu-
al transfonnation into Darth Vader.

No word on casting has come out yet,
but Lucas has tapped his Young Indiana
Jones collaborator Rick McCallum as pro-
ducer for the new series, and The Shawshank
Redemption scribe Frank Darabont as
screenwriter. Rumor has it that Lucas may
direct at least one of the ﬁlms himself; if true,
it would mark Lucas’ ﬁrst directorial venture
since the original Star Wars in 1977, the rig-
ors of which led him to abandon directing for
the less stressful position of story writer/exec-
utive producer. K

The ﬁnal question remains: can Lucas
do it again? His original vision capturedthe
imagination of the entire world; is it tempting
fate to try again? Or, worse, has the world
grown too accustomed to the cynicism of the
‘90s to appreciate Star Wars in the same way
it once did?

If history can be trusted, there’s hope.
After all, as many people read the Odyssey as
the Iliad. Apparently, not all sequels are
doomed to mediocrity.

Wars 

include:
0 Mos Eisley Spaceport. Previously, Mos
" Eisley was a shabby desert town with a few
aliens strolling the streets. Now, it really looks
like the “wretched hive of scum and villainy”
that Ben Kenobi describes, with shady—look-
ing creatures of every imaginable size and
shape packing each shot, from dinosaur-
giraffe things to storrntroopers on ferocious
“dewback” desert lizards to little hopping
scavenger vermin. Note the ludicrously cute
Imperial hover—droids — they show up again
on the Death Star.

0 Jabba the Hutt. An important scene
which was only cut because the 1977 attempt
to animate an alien J abba in post-production
didn’t work, this confrontation between Han
and Jabba serves as a crucial introduction to
the “price-on-my-head” subplot that runs
through the trilogy. And there are some nifty
side bonuses in here, too —— don’t be so dis-
tracted by Jabba that you fail to notice his
companions.

0 The space battles. Though they’re
mostly the same, there are a few spectacular-
ly executed shots slipped into the battle
sequences that, in a word, rock. The opening
Star Destroyer sequence now features an
underbelly shot of the Destroyer swallowing
the Rebel ship; the Millennium Falcon can
now be seen gracefully rising out of Mos

 

Eisley and blasting off past the Imperials; the
ﬁnal attack on the Death Star includes not
only a phenomenal close-up ﬂyby of the X-
wing squadron, but some slick smoothing out

of the rough edges in the original footage.

0 Biggs. No, we still don’t get to see
Luke’s conversation with his buddy, Biggs
Darklighter, outside the infamous Tosche
Station. But we do get to see Luke’s reunion
with Biggs in the X-wing hangar on Yavin
before the battle, and it’s a nice little scene,

also featuring Red Leader.

0 Greedo. This is the one ﬂaw in the Star
Wars Special Edition. Apparently, Lucas
decided that Han’s blasting of Greedo made
him seem just a bit too cold-blooded, so the
end of the scene has been re—edited to make it
clear that Greedo actually ﬁres ﬁrst and miss-
es before Han fries him. A travesty. Han
would never let a third-rate gunman like
Greedo get the draw on him —— and damn it,
he’s not a farmboy like Luke, he’s a pirate. If
he’s not a little cold-blooded at the beginning
of the story, it doesn’t mean as much when he

ﬁnally comes around at the end.

This one nuisance aside, the job that
Lucas and his crew have done is outstanding.
Star Wars was the act to follow for decades
after its release; now it’s ﬁnally state-of-the

art again.

Occasionally — and I mean once in a
long while — someone my own age, with
whom I happen to be talking, will sheepishly
admit that she has never seen Star Wars.

When this happens, I never know what
to say. Should I opt for politeness and act as
though this is perfectly acceptable? Should I
just nod my head and say, “Mmmm?” Or
should I follow my gut reaction and shout,
“By the beard of Beelzebub, how is that
POSSIBLE???”

After all, Stir‘ Wars isn’t just a popular
science—ﬁction movie. It’s not even just a ﬁlm
classic. It’s  well, it’s Star Wars — a mod-
em—day epic myth comparable only to
Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey, written two and
a half millemiia since. What other singular
ﬁctional creation has permeated our culture
as thoroughly as has the world of Luke
Skywalker, Darth Vader, and “the dark side of
the Force”?

Like Homer’s epic cycle, the Star Wars
trilogy has inspired hordes of artistic irnita—
tors: ﬁlmmakers trying to recreate the “block-
buster action movie” money-making phe-
nomenon, science—ﬁction writers trying to
blend outer space and fantasy kingdoms
without being corny, and enthusiastic ama-
teurs who just want to borrow their favorite

childhood characters for a while and give
them a new adventure to run around in. .

Unlike Homer, however, the man who
gave birth to Star Wars is still very much
alive. And George Lucas has decided that it’s
time to weave a few more threads through his
tapestry. Why go back and mess with a piece
of art that, in its present form, is responsible
for altering entire literary/cinematic genres, as
well as creating new ones? The answer to that
question lies in an understanding of Star
Wars’history.

The summer of 1973 saw the release of
a small—town-teenager—coming—of—age ﬁlm
called American Graﬁiti. Faced with a most-
ly unknown cast, a simple script, and a
sciulfy little nobody director — whose only
previous feature credit was an artsy science-
ﬁction piece with the less-tl1an—captivating
title of IHX-I138 — Universal Pictures saw
no reason to spend more than $1.3 million on

Graﬂizi. When the ﬁlm ended up taking in an
eventual $117 million in worldwide ticket
sales and launching the career of Richard
Dreyfus, however, people sat up and took
notice. 1
One of them was Alan Ladd, Jr., a 20th-
Century Fox executive who liked Grajﬁti so
much that he signed the director —— George
Lucas to shoot a ﬁlm for Fox, a “space
fantasy” that would evoke the feel of the
swashbuckling adventure serials of the
1940s. Lucas knew that the ﬁlm in his mir1d’s
eye couldn’t possibly be made for less than
$12 million; Fox gave him only $10 million
to do it.

When Star Wars hit the screen in 1977,
it became the top—giossing ﬁlm in movie his-
tory, as well as the greatest pop culture phe-

Tomorrow, Star Wars fans the
world over will be covering their
eyes with their hands and anxiously
peeking through their ﬁngers to dis-
cover the answer to the ne_rve-wrack-
ing question: “Is it good?” ‘

They can relax. It’s good.

For the most part, it’s exactly
the same ﬁlm we remember. Only a

been radically altered, and the

plagued by the armoyance that he had pos-

make the ﬁlm turn out quite the way he want-

Only now, twenty years later, has tech-
nology progressed to the point where Lucas
can feasibly “ﬁnish” the ﬁlm to his satisfac-
tion.

scenes and shots that Lucas had been forced
