By lOHNETTE HOWARD

NEW ORLEANS —— For those
closet dwellers and troglodytes
who missed the deluge of happy
details emanating from the New
Orleans Super Dome following the
Pitt Panthers’ heart-stopping, last-
minute Sugar Bowl triumph over

the No. 2-ranked Georgia
jﬁztlldogs-——r1ot to mention a tar-

iwnished image—we offer little help

here. u ‘

What follows is not a game story,
per se, but rather a variety of anec-
dotes, sidelights and minutiae sur-
rounding the Panther team’s vault
back into the heights of the
national rankings, a vault fromthe
nether regions of the top l0 to the
runner-up spot in the Associated
Press poll, and No. 4 rank in the
United Press International poll.

With their sights set on vindica-
tion, their hearts nd efforts steeped
in resolve, the Panthers stormed

. intothe New Orleans Super Dome

I New Year’s Day and strutted out as
‘~ e conquerors they had been 10 of
ii» times before this season.

It was a heart-warming epilogue
to a year that started clumsily in a
training camp most celebrated for
its mediocrity, and 21 happy ending
to a season that climaxed once with
a three-week repose at the No. 1
spot, then plummeted with a 48-16
loss to Penn State, and finally,»]an.
1, with seconds left in the game,
culminated in an end zone celebra-
tion that will, years fro_m now, still
dampen some eyes for what it
meant to a young team that, as
Coach Jackie Sherrill put it, “over-
came themselves."

Pitt Sugar Bowl hero John Brown admitted the game-winningiTbi pass he hauled in to

doubted he’d catch up to the ball. “What did you expect me to do,” he joked.

before a defender knocked him to
the turf in the end zone. When he
stood up, the whole Pitt team was
leaping /and lumbering toward
him. ’
“Did I think I'd catch up to the
ball? What else would I do,” Brown
said and laughed shortly after the
game ended. Although he later
admitted the pass, at first, seemed a
bit too long, all he could say in the
immediate post—game euphoria
was, “It was a beautiful pass, a typ-

ical Dan Marino pass. And I knew _

I’d catch it.”

Marino, who should perhaps be
lauded as much for his last-minute
persuasive powers as his throwing
arm, walked away with the Sugar
Bowl Classic Most Valuable Player
award after a”26 for 41 passing day,
good for 261 yards, three touch-
downs, and a place in some high-
light film, if not football history,
with Brown, who hauled in six
catches, including two TDs, in the
game.‘ A

“At first I thought I threw it too
far,” Marino said later. “They
(Georgia) brought everybody up,
but luckily our backs picked up the
blitz. They left Brown all alone on

the safety..."

The above salutation, peculiar
to the red-and-black-clad, leather-
lunged glut of Georgia fans that"
descended on New Orleans would
later become a Pitt taunt. But in the
days before the game, two other
jokes, both older, reworked ver-
sions, were being bandied around
the town to describe the voluble
Georgians: A Georgia fan comes to
town with one shirt and a $10 bill
and doesn’t change either, and his

clothes areas red as his neck. A

No, Pitt's Student Union
isn't crumbling down around
you. It's just that extensive
renovations for the former
hotel-turned-student-union
have now begun. \

Director‘ of Student Activi-
ties Andy Smith said that
floors 3 through 7 are being
cleared now by workers from
the Messaro Company, the
firm handling the construc-
tion.

Projected completion dates
for those floors are:

3-—Late May to mid-June
('82)

4—Mid-June to July
5—Mid—July to August
6-—Late July

.7—~Early September

When the upper floors are
completed, work will begin on
floors one and two, Smith
said. All renovations are
expected to be completed in
summer, 1983, although this
date could change if any con-
struction problems occur.

Work on the building “is
moving faster than we
imagined," Smith said.

‘?sPitt Gets Ready ForjCo|d
Realitygof Budget Talks;

By SETH LUBOVE

January, the National Weather

N... ‘Service would have us believe, is

iyjﬁﬁllt’ coldest month of the year in

_ Pittsburgh. Most of Pittsburgh,
that is.

February, however, is the coldest
month of the year on the campus of
the University of Pittsburgh, and
it’s not just because of the
temperature. .

It's because February is the
month in which the ‘governor
annually presents his proposed
budget"to the Pennsylvania Gen-
eral Assembly, which includes the

_ amount of state support the gover-
nor intends to_ give to Pitt and the
other state—related universities.

.»fﬁ;»AII(l if Pitt administrators and
iiiibudget planners weren't already
cold because of the weather, they’ll
most likely l)e shivering when Gov.

Dick Thornburgh presents his fis-
cal year 1983 budget to the General
Assembly Feb. 9. '

Thornburgh already took a head‘

start iII reducing state support, or
appropriations, to Pitt and most

' other state and state-related agen-

cies by approving a 1 percent
across-the-board cut on Dec. 15 in
state expenditures for the balance
of the current fiscal year.

As a result of the cut, Pitt saw its
appropriations slashed by nearly
$800,000.

“Had these cuts not been made at
this time, the state could _have‘faced
the need for more substantial cuts
next year," Tliornburgh said when
he approved the cuts.

Penn State, another state-related
university that receives state sup-
port, fared even worse, witnessing
its appropriations being slashed by
$1.3 million for the current fiscal
year. ‘

The cut in state support also
comes on the heels of recent federal
cutbacks in educational support.
Under new Reagan administration
guidelines from the Office of Man-
agement and Budget, the Depart-
ment of Education would be forced
to cut its spending in 1983 almost
50 percent, from $14.9 billion to
$7.7 billion.

Some gloomy figures from the
National Center for Education‘Sta-
tistics report federal expenditures
in 1981 for public and private col-

» leges and universities down 1.2 per-.

cent from 1975 to 14 percent, while
state support increased 1.9 percent
during the same time.

for studentgaid, said Kenneth Reeh-
er, executive director of the Penn-
sylvania Higher Education Assis-
tance Agency (PHEAA).

He cited the federal cuts and
decreasing tax revenues as contri-
buting to this dismal outlook.

Pennsylvania part-time and
graduate students seeking state
support to help pay their tuition
have an ally this year in the State
Board of Education, whichfor the
first ti-me recommended PHEAA
loans for those students.

The board’s decision to recom- 9

Inend PHEAA loans for students
not enrolled full-time in Pennsyl-
vania colleges and universities was
a result of a “changing economy”
and the trend of individuals return-
ing to school, according to Russell
Evans, executive secretary of the
board. - 3

However, Reeher was not very
enthused with_ the board's
recommendation.

-.

“We can only cover part-time
students if the law is changed,” he
said. “And if they (the General

V Assemply) change the law, then .

they ought to provide the
funding/.” "E

Despite the concessions for part-
ti'rne‘*'and graduate students, ‘the
board was not as helpful this year
in its recomme—ndation—or lack
thereof-—of specific appropria-
tions for state and state-related
institutions. 0 ‘

For the second straight year, the
board decided against the specific

« recommendations, instead recom-

mending that the governor chan-
nel increased ,. funding
PHEAA. ' .

PHEAA, is requesting $105.8
million for its fiscal year 1983

budget, an 8.7 percent increase over ,

its current budget. PHEAA's fiscal
year 1-983 budget breakdown is as
follows: $85.1 million for grants,
$16.3 million for
grants, $2.6 milliofi to match fed-
eral funding and $1.7 million

Sweet Talk

For a few moments this past New Year’s
weekend, we were able to put behind us the
thoughts of a new semester, our grades from
the semester past, tuition hikes and the
dreariness of another winter to be spent in
Oakland. For the time it took a football to
travel nearly '45 yards in the air, millions of
Pitt students, alumni and football fans
throughout the nation held their collective
breaths on this New Year’s night. And"
when it was all over, the Panthers thrilled
us with one of their greatest victories ever in
a 24-20 Sugar Bowl win over Georgia.

We closed last semester lamenting the
many crises that faced us during the last
half of 1981--including the despair which
‘followed a 48-14 loss to Penn State. At the
time, our hopes were for national redemp-
tion on New Year’s Day. Not only was our
reputation restored, but Pitt gave the foot-
ball world one of its greatest bowl games
since Notre Dame beat Alabama on a field
goal to win the Sugar Bowl on New Year’s
Eve 1973. ' "

It was a day -of redemption for Dan
Marino. He fell suspect after the Penn State
game, but came back to show the world that
Herschel Walker is not the only collegiate
underclassman who could start for any pro
team. It was a day of redemption for Bryan
Thomas, Wayne DiBartola and the rest of
the Pitt running game who chewed up the
country’s No. 2 defense and proved Pitt does
not live by the pass alone.-— ' g

It‘was a day of redemption for the young
defensive line, which, despite the machina-
tions‘ of the Georgia cheering section in the
ABC broadcast booth, manhandled the sup-
posedly greatest running back ever to put

on a pair of short pants and shoulder pads.

Above all, it was a day_of redemption for
Coach Jackie Sherrill,‘ his staff, and the
entire Pitt team, who showed it could play
with the best, and that inferences connect-
ing Pitt’s schedule with its No. 1 ranking
during the season were unfounded. It was
also a day of crow-eating for the Sugar Bowl
officials who were less than ecstatic over.
their bowl selection following Pitt’s loss to
Penn State.

There was certainly a great euphoria that
surrounded the events of New Year’s wee-
kend, and there is no better feeling with
which to start a new semester and a new
year. So it is with a hearty “Hail to Pitt” and
best hopes for 1982 that we welcome eve-
ryone back for the winter semester.

Dear Editor:

“The Impact of Reaganomics on

1981) is a typically lachrymose arti-
cle deploring the Reagan adrninis—
tration’s insensitivity to \tlne
“important part the world of tie

‘arts plays in our everyday lives.”

Since such lazy_ and subjectivejour-
nalisrn typifies most Pitt News
news articles since the election,
some/one ought to point out that

. thereare two sides to the issue.

The question is not “how
important will supporting the arts

whether those who do enjoy the
arts should have the right to

force those who do not to subsidize '

their pleasures through involun-
tary taxation. Government support
means that a person who does not
enjoy and who never goes to the

pay a portion of the ticket price for
those who do. No matter how

Pitt Needs Day Care Center

Dear Editor:

I was very interested to see the

new affirmative action giiidelines

being established at the university.
As a woman student and a mother,
I have not found the university to
be particularly encouraging as a
place to study because of their lack
of consciousness of the needs of
woman students. However; I ques-
tion how “affirmative" this action
really is. y 3
Women do face “special pres-
sures" and unusual demands, but
some of us want to be encouraged
to accept more responsibility, not
be relieved of it. Clearly, the curric-
ulum at Pitt is designed primarily
to meet the needs of younger stu-
dents who are still dependent on
their parents—who are removed
from the pressures in the “outside
world" such as money, a- place to
live, and children. If Pitt is sincere
in reaching out to a more diverse
population, it will be sincere in
providing this population services
to encourage their development.
not measures to make it easier. I for
one want to take advantage of all

possible intellectual opportunities ‘

so that I can further my academic
development. I do not want to be
relieved of responsibility because I
am a woman. Unfortunately.
because I do have children and the

university lacks adequate services’

for me, I am hindered.

government,” but.

One of the services that we need
is a drop-in day-care system for stu-
dents who are parents of young
children and need to take afternoon
or evening classes. Even if children
are at day-care all day or school, the
problem remains of what to do
with them when a required class
meets only in late afternoon or
evening. Some of us do not feel
comfortable leaving our school-
children with babysitters to watch
TV all evening or with relatives or
friends. By establishing a child-’
ren's center. a cooperative effort
could be made by the entire aca-
demic community at Pitt to serve
woman students’ needs. Certainly

-G.

exemplary the cause, this is still a
form of legal robbery.

If Mr. Stock (the conductor of the
Pittsburgh New Music Ensemble
whose utterances constitute I7
paragraphs of the 18 paragraph
article) thinks that the arts in Pitts-
burgh deserve more support, he is .
perfectly free to seek voluntary con— ’
tributions from those Pitts-

Aburghers who “prefer symphonies

to military hands.
If contributions do not reach the
levels provided by the National
Endowment of the Arts, the only‘
logical conclusion is that the NEA
has been providing a free ride for
art patrons (who are typically
wealthier and better educated than
the average) at the expense of every-
one else. By cutting the subsidies
for art lovers, the Reagan adminis-
tration helps to ensure that those
who desire such pleasures must pay
their full costs.

it could be a valuable and practical
activity for the education depart-
ment and conscientious students.

“Different” students need to be
encouraged in their rights for an
education, not have them taken
away. By not encouraging us to be
responsible for assignments we
may want to be involved in, you are
encouraging us to give up our
rights as students. I find it particu-
larly ironic when women’s studies
programs are offered in the even-
ings, for how can women study if
_there is no one to care for the
children? i

    The Inside Story  

Learning Skills Center:

.v‘-\« _. , , A

’It’s 1982 and last year’s resolu-
tions have been quietly replaced by
a new set and a strong vow to keep
each and every one.

The resolutions -to scale the
Cathedral via hiking boots and
rope and to tolerate your room-
mate’s obnoxious friends may

_never be kept, but a resolution to

improve your grades can be-with

some effort and a little help.
Regardless of whether the’ reso-

lution was made by choice or force

(your parents’ threat to cut off all '

future funds if your grades don’t
make a miraculous recovery within
the next four months), it’s not
impossible or hopeless thanks to
Pitt’s Learning Skills Center
(LSC). _ A

A component of the university’s
Counseling Service, the LSC serves
over 2,000 students a year and con-
sists of full-time staff members and

approximately 40 undergraduate’

academic/math counselors ready
to help you improve your grades
through effective study skills.
The LSC offers a wide range of
programs designed not only for
people who are having difficulty
with their studies, but also for
those who want to improve their
present study habits or ‘increase

, their abilities as learners.

Piredicated on the philosophy

that “effective study skills and pos-'

itive academic attitudes are the
most important factors in success-
ful scholarship and most valuable
in approaching new learnings,”
the LSC offers services ‘in the fol-
lowing areas: individual lab work

_ and reading diagnosis, math tutor-

ing, math study skills, and reduc-
tion of math anxiety. Special
programs for such groups as pro-

bation students and underachiev- _ ’

ers are also available.

All of these workshops are non-
credit and open to all interested
Pitt students, faculty and staff. All
programs, except speed reading
and graduate exam preparation
workshops, are free. All are held in
the LSC, located in the Student
Union Lower Lounge.

Below is a detailed look atta few
of the programs the LSC will offer
this term. For more information,
stop at the LSC office or call x5481.

Study Skills

This five-week_ series of informal
lectures on study skills could mean
the difference between an A and a
B. K.

The focus of the lectures is on
study-skills theory ‘ and why it
works. ‘

5‘One of the most prevalent prob-
lems we find is that most students
do not have a strategy for reading a
_textbook,” says Georgine Mater-
niak, LSC assistant coordinator.

I

Lower Lounge.

“Too many students depend on
repetition, thinking that if you
read a chapter over three or four
times despite a lack of concentra-
tion, the information will sink in.”

According to Maternia_k, the key
to textbook reading is developinga
strategy that first involves survey-
ing a chapter and formulating

while after learning then falls steeply (80 percent

  A way to BetterGrades  

questions about its contents, and
second, reading the chapter with
periodic stops to summerize in
your own words what points the
author is making.

“This type of strategy increases
the probability of transferring
information in your long-term
memory,” says Materniak.

Another habit that increases the
probility of transference is that of
reviewing lecture notes imme-
diately after class or within 24
hours.

"Human recall is (at) its greatest
immediately after class and it falls
rapidly after the first day,” says
Materniak.

Most study-skills workshops are
made up of 6 to 12 students, meet
once a week for a two-hour period,
and are run by peer counselors-—
undergraduates who are trained -to
te_ach study skills.

According to Materniak, a peer
counselor is not a tutor, but a facil-
itator of learning.

“A facilitator of learning is
someone who teachesanother per-
son how to become independent
and teach himself, as opposed to a
tutor who teaches a person about a
certain subject," she explains.

The success of the study skills
workshops can be gauged by the
student evaluations of study habits
that are taken after completion of
the workshop series. Of the stu-
dents surveyed, 98 percent indi-
cated that their study habit had
improved. Ninety-two percent of
the students felt more confident of
themselves as students, while 76
percent said their grades‘ had
improved. The 24 percent who
indicated no change in grades.
indicated instead that they antici-
pated an improvement in their
final grades.

Math 

Anxiety is sometimes the major V to

stumbling block for students expe
riencing trouble with math.
“Often a bad experience in math,
such as a poor high school teacher,
leads to a poor performance in col-
lege _math,” says Tom Lucidore,
the“LSC math coordinator. “Usu-
ally, it's a matter of modifying
attitudes." _ —
To help get to the cause of this
anxiety, Lucidore often uses a
unique approach. He often has stu-

dents write a “math autobio-

graphy” to uncover the underlying

causes. Many of these math autobi-

educational systems, poor. study
techniques and even the socializa-
tion of women are factors contri-
buting to math anxiety, according
to Lucidore.

The LSL. will offer a six-week
math problem-solving works.hop
designed to help develop general
analytical

I strategies.

“This workshop . offers an
approach to studying math,
(including) problem-solvingrstrab
egies as well as test-taking tech-

niques,” explains Lucidore. “It is I

also useful for math-related courses
such as physics and chemistry.”

The only tutoring services the
LSC offers is in basic math courses.

These include the algebra, trigo-’

nometry and calculus sequences.
Tutoring is o‘n an individual basis
and by appointment only.

problem-solving

 

LSC Math Coordinator
Tom ‘Lucidore

With the everiiicreasing demand
in the job market for technical
skills, the LSC math services have
become essential.

“The demand for math help has i

been steadily increasing over the
past few years," Lucidore says.
“We are at a saturation point,
where we offer as many math pro-
grams as we can and all are filled. I
think if we offered help around the
clock, the courses would still be
filled."

The LSC also provides diagnos-
tic testing for anyone who IS not

. "\
m‘‘ur'e of his math skill level or who

has been out of school for an‘
extended period of time and needs
to determine the appropriate math
course-Ito take.

Speed
Reading

Just knowing how to read is not
enough in college. Knowing how
to read effectively is essential if one
is ever to plow his way through
fine-print‘_700-page textbooks.

To aid in this reading battle, the
LSC has developed a speed-reading
program to show students how to
develop an effective reading rate.

“With this program, a student’s,

reading. speed sliouldincrease to a
level that can be sustained for a
period of time, while acliieving 75-
90 percent concentration,”
explains Jane Leavy, LSC reading
specialist. ' ‘ ~

LSC’s speed-reading program
compares with other commercial
speed-reading programs in that
both teach the same techniques.
The differences lie in the promises
and costs. I

“We do not make fantastic
claims about teaching students to

read at phenomenal speeds,’.’ Leavy ‘

says. “We do claim that you will
double'y0ur initial reading rate
eiiher with ‘increased or main-
tained comprehension. Also we
only charge 35.” ' w

Leavy points out further that
most speed-reading courses, unlike
the LSC’s, are geared toward high-
school students and fail to explain

why they work.

“Here we try to tailor the course
to the individual,” she explains.
“Comprehension is built around
recognizing an author‘s organiza-
tion of non-fiction material; that
is, looking for thought units rather
than word-by-word reading."

While there are people who feel
speed-reading is not as effective as
traditional reading methods,
Leavy says thatmany reading.spe-
cialists agree that, the [reading
methods most people are taught in
high school do not touch on the
problems of speed, time amount,
retention, analysis or organization.

Developing pacing techniques
to reinforce comprehension and
developing wider peripheral vision
in order to take in more words
helps to increase speed, according
to Leavy. Another. factor which
helps increase speed and compre-
hension involves making the stu-
dent aware of poor reading habits
so that they can be corrected.

The "speed-reading course is
limited to six students and is six
weeks in length. The $5 ‘fee-is pay-
able ai registration.

Learning
Counseling

There is nothing like learning

from someone who has _already
been through it. That is exactly

what the LSC has in mind with its
learning counseling program.

In addition to teaching appro-
priate study skills, peer counselors
help students to apply these skills
to specific course material.

Groups are formed for ‘most
large introductory classes but vary
every term depending upon the
availability _of a peer counselor
with the appropriate background.

.Many members of Pitt's, increas-

ing population of returning adult -

students are turning to the learning

counseling programs for help.

. “Many of these men and women

are in the midst of a career change
A and come here to brush up on var-

ious learning skills?’ says Luci-

dore. “It’s often reassuring to work

with a student counselor in a sim-

ilar situation and who really
I knows what it is like.”

Much emphasis is placed on how
the thinking process works in these
learning counseling groups, as
well as the other LSC programs.
The LSC staff bases their programs
and courses on information
gathered from ongoing studies and
research on the learning process.

.“It’s ironic that so much of what
we do out of human nature goes
against how the mind works,”
Materniak says. ‘

For example, many people think
that studying for eight consecutive
hours is twice as good as studying

4 for four consecutive hours.

“This is true to a certain point,
but what’s more important is the
quality of time put in,” Lucidore
says. “After a certain point in time,

 

\
the mind fails
information.”

According to both Lucidore and

to retain

Materniak, the better situation is to.

study for shorter amounts of time

more frequently and never to study

more than an hour and a half at a
given time.

“The basic principle in any
learning skills program is to
understand the mind’s saturation

point .-and‘ not to overload,"

explains Materniak. “In other
words, retention is much better
with three one-hour study periods
than one three-hour study period.”

How ’Bout Them Dawgs!

Happy Details Emyanate from Bourbn Street

continued from page one
By Friday-—New Year’s Day and

- game day—it‘ was evident Georgia

fans take their football seriously.
Their clothes are red, their cars are

, red, as are their shoes, socks, ‘hats,

jewelry, tattoos, buttons and any-
thing else they care to show you.
To them, Herschel Walker, the
sophomore sensation tailback is a
demi-god, and the good game itself
is revered with a fervor paralled
only by religion, the South, a car

, with chrome wheels and horn that

plays “Dixie,” and country—in
that order.

“Football is religion down

here,” explained one southern tele-

I vision reporter. “How well a team
does, to these people, reflects..on
_-‘their towns, the university, the

' whole state.

It’s traditionally
important here. In some places,

1 that's all there is. You bet they take

it seriously."

Very seriously, as Pitt Student
Government President-elect Todd
Deluca discovered. DeLuca and
several other members of Pitt’s

"Delta Tau Delta fraternity had

2

invested $28 in a blue-and-gold Pitt
banner.

s Later they proudly mounted the
flaglion the wrought-iron‘grillwork
of a third-floor balcony in their

hotel while an impromptu Geor- .

gia pep rally. formed on Bourbon
Street below. The crqwd began to
‘swell ‘after someone spotted televi-
sion cameras filming the proceed-
ings from the balcony below
DeLuca. I

 Suddenly, from behind him, a

middle-aged, red—clad Georgia fan, «

wearing a cowboy hat emblazoned
’wi.th a large G, halted her booze-

in I ridden march down Bourbon Street

to clamber to DeLuca’s floor, storm
the balcony along with a six-year-
old youngster, and rip the flag
from its moorings. ,
With one fell swoop, the Geor-
gia afficionado brol I the shaft over
her knee and start to rip the
banner from the rt .2 ng por-

' tion- of the stick untn sevt '1‘ peo-

, ering bystanders,

ple tried to restrain her.

“Why don’t you damn \ i\€€S
go home," she shouted, sw. ing
and clawing unsuccessful. 'l[

‘DeLuca with one bloodied I l
she had cut on the shaft.

,“We thought she was craz,
DeLuca said.

a Look out! ...Pitt‘Chancellor Wes-
leylPosvar has a gun. And he’s not
afraid to use it.

Many people visit New Orleans
during Sugar Bowl week for the
fun and excitement as well as the
annual football game that visits
this painted lady of a town-a town
where things are overdone, per-
ha.ps,.but never outdone.

Why~,,even Pitt Chancellor Wes-
ley Posvar and the boys from the
Sugar Bowl Committee, who all
cut a fine figue in their royal blue
blazers with_the proud, shimmer-
ing silver crests on the brestpocket,
were yukking it up three nights
before the game in the hospitality
room of the Hilton Hotel, Pitt’s
bowl headquarters. "

It seems the chancellor, in the
throes of frivolity, espied a squirt
gun on a table top in the hospital-

ity room and promptly loaded up .

at the faucet. After the chancellor
considered zeroing in on a few cow-
he opted for
familiarity and Pitt assistant
Coach Bob Matey, the target of the
subsequent jet stream.

The next night, Posvar returned
to the scene.
“Oh the chancellor is here,”
someone said. “Hide the squirt
egun.”

W .~ ~ ~..- ». .1

Too late. Posvar was quicker on
the draw, _repairing to sink to
reload. This time, after bout of
indecision, he sent a watery blast
\that hit home on Dean Billick, Pitt
associate athletic director for pub-
lic affairs, smoting him on the
forehead. . — '

In the New Orleans jazz halls,‘

beveled-glass-and-brass pubs and

bistros, and cobblestone Vieux

Carre streets, Pitt Panther football

teams have a reputation for party-.

ing, a legacy the Pitt 1976 national

'championship team and Sugar

Bowl predeccessors left this year's
team.  ,
How, the Southern writers
grumbled both privately and in
print, do /these Yankee hellraisers

come down,‘ booze it up and still -

outplay the Southern soda-sipping

V gridders? One reporter put the

question to Panther middle guard
LC. Pelusi at a Wednesday press

=1ference. ,

Ve’re getting a reputation for

" Pelusi said and smiled. “But

h Sherrill has told us this
, t ..-e is a reward. He lets us go out
a it: enjtiy oursleves, but we don’t
forget we're still here to win the
game.”

“I guess Dorsett proved that you
fellas could play a game even if
y'all don’t have curfews,” said the
writer. _

“Well, Coach Sherrill real_izes
we’re young, mature adults,”
Pelusi said. “And if he believes
that..." Pelusi laughed.

“Have you seen much of New
Orleans?” the reporter continued.

“Only from the street up,"
Pelusi quipped. I

#=II=l=##

In a state marred by recent racial
killings in Atlanta and high unem-
ployment, Fate smiled two years
ago on the state of Georgia. Her-
schel Walker, the Bulldogs electri-
fying 6-2 220—pound tailback. was
almost a Southern Cal Trojan. Or a
Clemson Tiger. Or, believe it or
not, a U.S. Marine. Georgia won
out in the end, on a coin toss.

When Walker was sifting
through-the mountain of college
offers his ‘senior year in high
school, he almost joined three

_ I

childhood friends who had enlisted
in the Marines.
“I considered it. I think it’s excit-
ing. It gives you something to do
every day,” Walker explained.
Walker's sister suggested he flip
a coin to determine which of his
three final choices—Georgia,
Clemson, or USC—would win.

“I don’t think she meant it, but I .

did it. I had my heart set on going
to USC, but when I got back from
my visit’, I could tell my family
didn't want me to go too far from
home. So I flipped acoin and Geor-
gia won. I still wasn't satisfied, sol
pulled names from a bag. Georgia
won again,” Walker recalled with a
grin. '

“I reckon God was trying to tell
me something. I’ve been thanking
himiever sirice.” ‘

So have Georgia fans.

=l==HI=l!##

Herschel Walk-er says football is I

not his first love. That would be
track—he is a world-class sprinter
and aspirant to the 1984
Olympics—followed by dancing,
football and writing poetry. For
such priorities, he’s been portrayed
as an enigma by some; despit such
priorities, he’s been called the grea-
test running back in the game——
college or pros.

Walker is also a 19-year-old kid
with an odd, slightly high voice
that still occasionally cracks in
mid-sentence, a trait that belies his
tremendous bulk. His build fits the
locomotive running style he exhib-
its on the field; the sculpted slabs of

‘muscles cord_his broad neck and
shoulders, flowing down into his
powerful sprinter thighs.

In a crowd of reporters he excels
as often as he does on the field,
handling questions plesantly,

calmly and adroitly, standing out’

as much for his wit as his size.

Witness:

0 What Walker will do when the
season ends:“Oh, I think. about a
lot of things-—-running track, chal-
lenging the rule (the NFL rule pro-
hibiting college football players
from turning pro before spending
four years enrolled in school),
going to Canada. Or, maybe I
might just go work at a filling

swarming Pitt defense.

0 What it would take to lure
Walker to the» pros: “If someone
offered ‘me $4 million, I’d have to
look at it...but I didn’t have much
when Igrew up and I don’t need

much now. I just want tobel

happy.” I

0 On the_- type of coverage pro-
vided by his reported $1 ‘million
insurance policy with Lloyds of
London which protects him finan-
cially from a career-ending injury:

‘.‘Well, I reckon it protects my legs. '

Iihope it protects my whole body,
sir.”

0 His attitude toward football:
I want to play and go

 

Pitt Coach Jackie Sherrill’s team had the edge in the

game plan. Using a slew of short passes on first down
, and trap and draw plays on latter downs, the Panthers ,
  kept the Daw9s,_9'.,'-P?!9t'99£l throughout. the game.

the Sugar Bowl game meant a

Said Thomas, _ before the game,
“We’re going to try to establish the

and I’ll try to gain some too. It’s an
incentive to play against him
(Walker). I’d like to prove I have
some of the same ability. It’s an
incentive to try to match him, to
outdo him.” .

Thomas, after the game, said
“Howmany yards did I get?"

“Eighty-four yards,” was the
reply.

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

The Pitt Panther basketball
team suddenly has a lock on last-
second wins. ,1

While the footI)all team got into
the heart stopping heroics in the
Sugar Bowl, it has been the hoop-
sters, and particularly sophomore
forward Clyde Vaughan, who have
won games in the very last possible
moments.

After all, Dan Marino and com-
pany did it with 35 seconds to go.
Huh, you call that heart stopping?
Try a last-second turnaround

2' jumper from 30 feet at the buzzer by

Vaughan in Pitt’s one-point win
against Tennessee a week ago yes-
terday. Now that's a finish!
While Monday’s 60-59 Pitt win
over Temple didn't have the same
last-second shot, it nevertheless

proved unnerving, especially to
Pitt Coach Roy Chipman who
couldn't bear to watch Vaughan

V , thers

sink two game-winning free
throws with on.'_/ two seconds
remaining.

Ten minutes earlier, Chipman
was turning his head——not in ner-
vousness but in disgust—as his
team was doing its best to emulate a
Marx Brothers movie.

Passes were being thrown 10 feet
over players heads, lazy bounce
passes were intercepted and the
entire Pitt team looked as if it had
fallen into a tub of liquid Sominex.

Down by 14 with 10 minutes to
go and sleepwalking for most of
the game, the Panthers appeared
dead. After all, this was Temple,
8-2, a team who had already beaten
Villanova. After all, this was the
Palestra, where Chipman had
never won. And, after all the
Panthers were down 14.

It was bound to catch up to Pitt.
While the Owls dispersed their
first-half scoring, the _Panthers got
only three players into the scoring
column. Though down by only
three at the half, 28-25, Chipman
couldn’t continue counting on
Vaughan, who had 13 first-half
points, freshman Andre Williams,
who had eight and" Dwayne Wal-
lace who scored four, to keep the
game within reach. It’s a five-man
sport, remember?

By the time it reached 47-33, bas-

il ketball was the farthest thing from
 Pitt’s mind.

Temple’-s 2-3 zone hung in close
to the ‘basket and dared the Pan-
to hit shots over it. Pitt
couldn’t, and as Vaughan rarely
saw the ball in the second half, the
zone drew in even tighter. Yes, a
comeback seemed highly unlikely.

Unlikely, that is, until Williams
came into the lineup. The skinny
6-8 center, -who has been the most
pleasant surprise of all the touted
rookies, played possessed. Scratch-
ing, clawing and outhustling a
Temple team that had dominated
the boards for most‘ of the game,
Williams began his assualt with a
scoop lay-in as he was fouled. Wil-
liams’ ‘three-paint play seemed to
shake the lethargy from the
Panthers. ,

It was then that Chipman re-
inserted guard Wallace who had
been sitting on the bench with 4
fouls, into the game.

“Heck, I am not going to lose the

game with my best player on the
bench," Chipman remarked.

Wallace came through with six

second-half points, as did Darrell
Gissendanner, who scored three
quick buckets down the stretch.
But it was Williams, with his array
of inside jumpers and tip-ins, that
brought the Panthers back.

The freshman who was to end up
with 18 points, one short of Vaugh-
an’s Pitt‘ high, also made himself
known on the defensive end with
some good boxing-out.

Williams’ good defense‘
appeared contagious as the Owls
began to turn the ball over, giving
Pitt easy fast break layups. Temple
was also generous at the foul «line,

 
 
  
  
  
 
 
  
 
 
   
   
   
  
   
  
  

\I\\I.‘.
I-\«t\I\\\

Clyde Vaughan

hitting only 19 of 30 shots. Even
with all the holiday spirit, Temple
still led by 6 with 7:07 left on the
clock. But two Wallace free throws
and a,Steve Beatty layup quickly
cut it to a two-point spread.
Temple then felt like giving Pitt

a belated Christmas present as

john Stansbury missed two consec-
utive one—and-ones. The second
one gave the Panthers the ball,
down by one at 59-58, with I2
seconds to go.

Dwayne Wallace got the ball
slapped away with 4 reconds
remaining. Pitt ball under its own
basket. Tennessee game, right?
Give it to Vaughan. He got it, went
up fora shot, got hacked. Or so it
seemed. The referee calls a one-
and-one.,_‘ ’ ’

Poor Chipman, who couldn’t
bear to look. If he had he would
«have seen Vaughan cooly sink both
attempts and Pitt have another

.routine last-second finish.

Ho-hum.

PITT NOTES: After going 2-1 in
the Far West Classic with victories
over Tennessee and Iowa State and
a loss to Oregon State, plus beating
Temple on Monday, the Panthers
are_8-2....Pitt beat Utica and Robert
Morris over the holidays....Pitt's
next home game is Saturday
against Rutgers, which has already
beaten UCLA.

The Pitt Lady Panther basket-
ball squad will open 1982 at the
Pitt Field House against the
Colonial Women of George
Washington University. Pitt will
attempt to bring some consistency
to its winning ways. Over the
Christmas holidays, the Lady
Panthers were an even 3-3. Pitt has
never lost to George Washington,
and the outcome of this game
doesn’t figure to be any different.

After eight games, the Colonial
Women are 3-5. George Washing-
ton is led by senior center Leslie
Bond, who is averaging a team-

high 6.9 points and 8.8 rebounds ‘
per game. Bond is joined by three _

other seniors to give GW first-year
coach Denise Fiore plenty of expe-
rience on her squad. .
j‘‘This is going to be a year ()f
transition for us," said Fiore. “We
have to set some winning ways and
stren g t h
experience.”
joining Bond will be senior for-
ward Trish E'gan. Egan is the all-
time leading woman scorer for
George Washington with 1,071
points. Robin Illsley is the third
Colonial woman over
checking in at 6-1. Illsley is GW’s
second leading scorer with a 9.0
point average per game.
Pitt will counter with the East’s
best one—two punch at guard: I)eb-

' bie Lewis and Carol Dugan. Lewis,

Pitt’s all-time high’ scorer, is lead-
ing the Lady Panthers with a 20
point-per-game average. Dugan is
second on the squad with an 11.1
point—per-game average. Freshman
Jennifer Bruce rounds out the list
of Lady Panthers averaging in the
double digits. Bruce averages 10.4
points per game.

Leading ‘the way under 1 the
boards for Pitt willbe senior center
Gail Aughburns. Aughburns aver-

ages 19.7 rebounds per game, lead- 9
ing the Lady Panthers in that,

department: Aughburns also gives
the Lady Panthers an inside attack
by averaging close to nine points
per game. Joining Aughburns will
be junior Pam Miklasavich, the
second leading rebounder on the
squad, who has been playing with
a broken nose. '

Following is a capsule summary
of the Lady Panther games since
our last publication: \

KENT STATE 72, PITT 67

9 _ The Lady Panthers suffered a let-
down following their upset over
17th-ranked Clemson, Kent State
ran to a 35-31 lead at halftime, only
to see the Lady Panthers claw back
to take a six-point edge. However,
the Lady Panthers couldn’t put the
game out of reach and Kent State
pulled off an upset. Lewis had a
game-high 24 points. Bruce added

cause. Augliburns and reserve for-
ward Lynn Love each had 11
rebounds for Pitt.

PlTT 94, SYRACUSE 65

The Lady Panthers roared to an
early 11-point lead over the highly-
touted Syracuse Orangewomen.
Dugan and Lewis took turns
swishing the nets, and Aughburns
converted a three-point play at the
14:05 mark in the first half to give
Pitt 21 17-3 1ead.’The Lady Panthers
continually capitalized on Syra-
cuse mistakes, and 'it quickly
became evident that the Orange-
wornen were outrnatched. Pitt held
a 21-point margin at halftime, 50-
29.

Lewis set a Pitt Fieldhouse indi-
vidual scoring record, pouring in
38 points for the Lady Panthers.
Dugan contributed L4 and fresh-
man Lori Lewman added 10 in the
win. Aughburns grabbed 11 errant

shots and -Miklasevich‘nabbed 10

for the Lady, Panthers.

worked for the Lady Panthers in
the first half as they moved to a
37-31 halftime lead.
South Carolina came out of the
locker room and connected for six
unanswered buckets to take a 113-39
lead. The Lady Panthers never

caught up. Lewis and reserve for— 9

ward Lewman had 15 po_int."s apiece

loss. A

LASALLE TOURNAMENT

Pitt opened with a 78-70 win
over Monmouth University. The
Lady Panthers held a 13-point edge
at the half, 48-35. The game was
actually w()n at the foul line, where
the Lady Panthers made good on
22 of 28 freebies. Monmouth,
although they had two more field
goals than Pitt, was only 10 of 16
from the" charity stripe. Miklase-
vich led all scorers with 21 points.
I)ugan had 15, Lewis 14, Lewman
11, and Bruce 10 in the win. Gail
Aughburns and'Pam Miklasevich

had 12 and 11 rebounds
respectively.
Pitt advanced to the second

round and faced host team LaSa1le.,
Again, the foul line played a key
role in the outcome of the game,
but this time it worked against the
Lady Panthers. The officials sent
LaSalle to the line 31 times, com-

‘ pared to only five for Pitt. LaSal1e

popped in 20 freebies to secure the

.. 58-55 win, even though the Lady

Panthers had a 27-19 edge in field
goals. Lewis and freshman reserve
Stephanie Collins each had 16
points and Dugan had 12 in the
loss. ti '

For most Pitt students, Christ-
mas break is a time to relax and
visit with friends as a few extra
pounds go on. But for the Pitt
swim team, break comes when
school starts. The Panthers have
been putting in over 800 laps per
day over the holidays with only
Christmas and New Year's Day off.

The Panthers started the Christ-
mas season on a fast note as head
coach Fred Lewis directed the
East's largest Amateur Athletic
Union (AAU) meet in December on
the l8th through the 20th. For
Lewis and his swimmers, it was a
chance to show off Pitt’s facilities
and training program to prospec-
tive college recruits, now in high
school, as well as to coaches from
all over the liast.

“The meet was tremendous,"
said Lewis. “We packed the view-
ing stands every night. I was intro-
duced to many new faces in
swimming by their coaches. Many
asked good questions and asked for
applications to Pitt._”

Pitt's athletes showed well, too.’

Sandy Pidgeon had his best 200-
yard breaststroke and 400-yard
individual medley times this sea-

son, as did Pete I)oyle in the 50-

yard freestyle.
“Pete_'s'sprinting looks the best
ever," commented Lewis.

Pitt's upcoming opponents——

break.
Lewis did a lot of serious talking

The other swimmers present
were impressed with Pitt’s fine
showing despite the team's two
workouts per da-y ‘that stressed
maximum yardage. ‘Even on the
day of the meet, Pitt held its normal»
workout. Pitt then stayed home to
practice this year over the holidays,
due to l)ad pool practicing times on
previous visits to Puerto Rico.

“It was good to not stop our
weight program here at Pitt," said
Lewis. “It would have been a good
change of atmosphere to go south,

Coach Julian Krug.

Krug and the divers also jour-
neyed to Ft. L‘auderdale’s Hall of
Fame pool, where Nationals are
held, for one day of practice. For
the divers, it was not so much
learning any new dives while away
as it was a change in atmosphere
and an opportunity for taking an
assessment of attitudes towards the
remainder of the season. They also
have just as few meets left before
Easterns as the swimm'ers do. Their
next meet is also the Penn State
contest on Jan. 16.
