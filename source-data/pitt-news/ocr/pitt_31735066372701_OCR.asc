PPC
Cuts
Prices

By DIANE SCIULLO

Graduate students can attend all
Pitt Program Council (PPC)
affairs at undergraduate prices in
_March and possibly during April,
according to James Gilliland, pro-
gram coordinator for the PPC.

The idea will be tried on an
experimental basis, Gilliland said.
The Graduate and Professional
Student Association (GSPA) will
pick up the difference between
what the graduate students will
pay at the door and what they...”
would usually pay, he said. .

A record will be kept-.of the
number of graduate students who
attend PPC events during March to
help determine if GSPA should
is continue to discount graduate
admissions on a permanent basis,

said Gilliland. .
‘ According to GSPA president
Claude Sooprayen, the graduate
students wanted to pay the same
amount for PPC events that under-
graduates do.

"We thought it was unfair," said
GSPA president Claude Soo-
prayen, “for (graduate) students to
have to pay full price for PPC
events.

Sooprayen said bargaining will

According to Dr. Lewis Solmon,
author of the recent book Under-
employed Ph. D's, an enormous
jump in business majors among
_today’s top entering freshmen is
significant because in the past, the
business major had long been
avoided by the most academically
talented undergraduates.

Comparing top l97l high school
graduates with those of l978,.Sol-
man found a l0 percent increase in
the number of students intending
to major in business. .

May this mean that students
chose a major designed to prepare
them for making the big money? Is
money the apex on the students’
list of priorities when seeking out a

Robert Hopkins said studies
were done a few years ago which

illustrated priorities of job seekers. ,

The study showed, said Hopkins,
that potential employees’ highest
priority was being able to fully
utilize their skills. Second on the
list was opportunities for.advance—
ment emanating from a particular
job. Third was money.

“Now studies being done by sur-

culty of. attracting and keeping
interested faculty teaching in, for
example, computer science because
of higher salaries outside.”

When students come to the
placement service located on the
second floor in the Student Union,
Hopkins advises them there are
many more issues than fiscal con-
siderations when seeking a job.

Some of these include, he said,
carefully surveying the work envi-
ronment and assessing the degree
to which your abilities and skills
would be utilized.

“Some other major issues one
needs ‘to scrutinize carefully are ver-
tical considerations like what kind
of people your boss(es) and subor-
dinates are. Horizontal considera-
tions also need be examined which
include who your colleagues are-
namely, realizing if you have a

atmosphere,” he said.

Hopkins said he tries to make
people look beyond the immediacy
of obtaining a job in order to make

students aware of all factors
involved, not only financial
remuneration.

“I have had people come back to
me who are making considerable
amounts of money, yet, some are
still unhappy. In fact, the majority
of our graduates will change jobs
maybe three or four times in the
next 10 years. Some of them will
thus work in fields they were not
taught in,” he said. _ ___g _j___

majors designed to give students

undergraduates are enrolled in the
College of Arts and Sciences which
does not necessarily prepare a

He said graduates of liberal arts
programs are not in as high a
demand and that “they don’t com-
mand extremely
because they haven’t been trained.”

Graduates of liberal arts are
trained instead in the academic art
of the analysis of complex issues,
performing research, and learning
how to test ideas, according to
Hopkins.

“These skills are not technical,
instead personal. Therefore,
employers must transfer these per-

of a student, then look at the pre-
dominate profiles of workers in a
particular field—he usually can
Lhen make a match.

Diane Sciullo. David Deasy
Students

Diane Sciullo, a senior English
writing major, said she thinks a
college education should “open
your mind and broaden your
understanding of the world” as
well as give students a certain
knowledge in a specialized area.

“I don't think there’s necessarily
something wrong with coming to
college to train for a certain field,
but to enter school with only that
in mind is not necessarily a good

thing," she said. “Although it's
nice to imagine myself as a writer,
it's not very realistic because of the
tightness of the job market."

Sciullo's advice to incoming
freshman is for them to take their
time in deciding a major. She
would advise students to find a
“happy medium" in relation to
doing something they like as well
as taking into consideration that
particular job market.

David Deasy. a junior, said there
are three reasons for his choice of
mechanical engineering as a
major: a guarantee of a job after
school, a high starting salary, and a
“genuine interest in the field."

“Basically, I believe a lot ofother
engineering students picked the
major for the same three reasons,
but some place priorities differ-
ently," Deasy said. “Not all engi-
neering majors plan on making a

career of engineering, instead.
many pursue management posi-
tions or other professionalized
fields such as medicine."

“Students should think of col-
lege as a means to better their edu-
cation and thereby obtain a better
job. but that may not necessarily
mean the highest paying one-
there are other factors to consider
such as job location and opportun-
ities for advancement."

Deasy’s advice to incoming

freshmen is for them to be open

minded as far as their career direc-
tion, but that “they should have
some idea of what they would like
to get involved in."

“For me, money definitely
weighed; it was definitely an
important consideration in choos-
ing engineering as a career—but I
don't think it's most important,"
he concluded.

effects of the current budget
proposal would be:

0 The Pell Grant Program
would be slashed from its cur-
rent $2.28 billion to $1.4 bil-
lion. The study estimated that
one million students would be
eliminated from the program
and those remaining would
have their maximum grant
reduced from $1,600 to SL400.

0 Supplemental Education
Opportunity Grants, National
Direct Student Loans and State
Student Incentive Grants
would be completely elimin-
ated.

Aid Cuts Protested

0 "The College Work-Study
program would be reduced
from $528 million to $400 mil-
lion and an estimated 27 per-
cent of the federally subsidized
jobs would be eliminated.

OGraduate students would be
denied access to Guaranteed
Student Loans, affecting about
600,000 graduate students. ‘

The petition campaign
against the cutbacks in student
aid is only one issue the PSN is
taking up, according to Danyi.
He listed the other issues that
the PSN organizes : the opposi-
tion to U.S. involvement in El
Salvador and Central America,

draft opposition, the dangers of
fascism and the rise of the right-
wing terror groups such as the
Klan and Nazis and the purges
of U.S. and Soviet imperalism.

The PSN also plans to have
weekly literature tables in the
student union and Towers
lobby, forums, films and var-
ious other educational
programs.

Danyi also said, “The PSN
has open membership to all
concerned students. individuals
and organizations and works in
a coalition form. These dangers
are real and we must get
organized.”

Pitt Discloses Expenses

By JEFF RUSSELL

Pitt spent $8,233.17 on lobbying
efforts during the last six months of
1981, according to figures released
by the university Feb. 11.

This amount is the value of com-
plimentary football tickets for the
1981 season that were distributed
“to members and staff of the Gen-
eral Assembly and personnel
within the Executive Depart-
ment,” a report released by the Pitt
Governmental Relations Office
said.

Pitt, which has two registered
lobbyists, ranks near the top in
reported expenses. Common
Cause, a lobbying group concerned
with protecting the rights of the
individual, spent a reported

$30,595 to rank first. Penn State
second SDOt

earned the with

 

reported expenditures of $21,903.

Surprisingly, some of the sup-
posedly more powerful ‘lobbying
groups reported no expenditures at
all. Included in this group were the
Pennsylvania State Education
Association, with 25 lobbyists, the
AFL-CIO, the Pennsylvania
Chamber of Commerce and several
insurance companies. The latter
three groups all have at least ten
registered lobbyists.

The present law concerning dis-
closure of lobbyists’ expenditures
is considered to be too weak by sev-
eral state senators and representa-
tives. The present statute requires
the disclosure of expenses in excess
of $300 each per month for meals,
entertainment, “the costs of com-
munication” with government
officials and their staff and “other

expenditures” connected with
lobbying.

Dennis McManus, one of Pitt’s
two lobbyists, said that Pitt does
entertain legislators but not in
excess of the $300 limit.

State Senators Edward Howard,
R-Bucks Co., and James Lloyd, D-
Philadelphia, are sponsoring a bill
that is much stricter than the exist-
ing law. The bill would mandate
the disclosure of a wider range of
lobbyists’ outlays including offi-
cial expenses, salaries and travel
expenses.

McManus said he believes that
the existing statute does what the
legislators intended it to do, which
is to inform them as to who is
snending how much on lobbying.

According to McManus, the new
bill’s proposal to include travel

 

      
 

 
   
 
  
  
        
       
       
     
   

 
    
   
 
 

and salary outlays would not be an
effective way to compare lobby
groups’ spending.

“All that travel expenditures
would show is that Pitt is farther
from Harrisburg than Penn State
or Temple,” he said. “Including
salary in expenditures would not
be appropriate because lobbying

constitutes only 20 to 25 percent of
what I do."

McMaI1us said his job includes
spending “a great deal of time read-
ing legislation" and informing
Pitt's administrators of the legisla-
tion’s relevance to Pitt. He also
handles an average of 500 inquiries
a year from legislators and delivers
speeches to interested groups.

on his general statement that
unions are dying.

“Liberalism in this period has
no organization, no money, no
political party and no definition,”
he said. _

“If we come down with a case of
howling heebie-jeebies anytime a
country goes red, it is too big a load
to carry," he said regarding foreign
policy.

' It would help if the nation were
more _ cold blooded and non-
hysterical about our national inter-
est, according to Hoffman.

He referred to “protectionism"
as keeping foreign goods out of the
U.S., protecting the nation from
unemployment and bankruptcy.

He said Reagan, “judging by his
actions and not his heart," is the
first racist to live in the White

“It seems the president is trying\

to roll back to the past,” he said.

Hoffman classified himself as an

"I have to believe the liberal

said, “although they take different

arly Education

I Don’t be too surprised if, this summer term, you happen
to notice more clean-shaven and younger-looking faces
than normal appearing on Pitt’s campus. They’ll all be
part of the rush by high school seniors to beat a May 1
cut-off date for Social Security benefits for full-time
students.

For that matter, don’t be too surprised if those clean-
shaven young faces start replacing some of the older,
scraggly faces on Pitt’s campus of graduate students who
had been relying upon guaranteed student loans to pay

‘ their way through post-graduate school. Those are also

targeted to get cut in President Reagan’s proposed 1983
budget.

All of the proposed and definite cuts in education at the
federal level, and small increases on the state level, are
going to result in a lot of new and fewer faces on college
campuses nationwide. And it’s not just going to be stu-
dents who will be affected—faculty and staff can also
expect to see some of their own heads roll as a direct result
of less income for their colleges and universities.

The fact remains, however, that it’s going to be the
students who will be most deeply hurt by the administra-
tion’s proposed cuts in educational support. For example,
in the last school year, 2.6 million needy students received
an average of $901 per year under the Pell Grant program,
formerly known as the Basic Educational Opportunity
Grant program. Under guidelines adopted for the current
school year, the maximum Pell Grant a student could
receive was cut from $1,750 to $1,670.

Students receiving financial support through‘: the guar-
anteed student loan program will fare substantially worse
than those receiving Pell Grants. Reagan has proposed
that need for loans would have to be proven by students of
any income level, formerly a requirement restricted to
those students who came from families with an adjusted
gross income of more than $30,000. In addition, the
administration has proposed doubling the "origination
fee,” or that fee paid on the loan as soon as it is received
from the bank.

And finally, loans to graduate and professional stu-
dents, 650,000 of which received guaranteed loans last
year, would be cut out. Don’t worry, however, as the
president has come up with his own style of “relief” for
graduate students in the form of an increase in the amount
a student can receive from the high-interest Auxilary
Loans to Assist Students program, or the parent program.

The most significant changes in educational financial
support, and those which seem to be causing the greatest
amount of anxiety -for students, are the cuts in Social
Security benefits for full-time students 18 to 21 yearsof age
who are the children of retired, disabled or deceased
workers. The changes, which were approved by Congress
last summer, will strip almost 700,000 students nation-
wide of an average of $3,000 a year in Social Security
funding used for education. And even if high school
seniors can beat the May 1 cutoff, their benefits will still be
gradually reduced —25 percentin 1982,50 percent in 1983,
75 percent in 1984 and 100 percent after April 1985.

The problems these Social Security changes are-causing
were evident at a seminar on Pitt’s campus last week for
students and parents unsure of their future in financial aid
for education. The implications of seminars such as these,
and strategies on how to beat financial aid deadlines at Pitt
and other schools are, at the very least, disturbing.

They are disturbing largely because of the attitudes

these students will have toward their selection of a college .

and their attitudes once they arrive at college. For these
students, whose educational futures will be based upon
whether or not they can scrape up enough money for the
next term and the term after that, there will be little time to
test the academic and creativer waters. The water for these
students will be about as deep as their financial support
will go; and if they sink, then they are as good as drowned.

Joseph Merante, Pitt’s director of admissions and finan-
cial aid, made a rather sobering statement about the situa-
tion last weekzwhen he said: “In many instances, we find
parents and students are making a decision based on eco-
nomics, and they are not considering academic, emo-
tional, social and career decisions.”

While it would be fair to say that many students are
happy to get admitted to college, the sad fact of the matter
is that many students in the future, particularly those
beginning with next year's freshman class, will be happy
to be able to pay for college, let alone be admitted.

An Education in FinanclalCut:i

Mobilize to

Protest Cuts in .

Loans

Dear Editor:

In its Feb. 10 edition, The Pitt
News announced the 6 percent
increase in Gov. Dick Thorn-
burgh’s proposed fiscal year 1983
appropriation for Pitt. Pitt Chan-
cellor Wesley Posvar hailed the
increase as a demonstration of the
governor’s “...appreciation that
higher education builds human
capital for the commonwealth”.

On that same day, The New
York Times carried two articles on
the effect of President Reagan’-s
New Federalism on higher educa-
tion. The 1983 proposed budget
includes the elimination of Gua-
ranteed Student Loans (G.S.L.) to
graduate and professional , stu-
dents. There are no loan sources
available to Pitt grads other than
the G.S.L. In ‘light of the facts that
graduate students are currently
ineligible for work study (with lit-
tle improvement seen for the fall)
and that the Tuition Remission
program has run dry for the first
time in several years, Pitt grad stu-
dents will need employment to
finance their degrees. This comes
at a time when Pennsylvania's offi-
cial unemployment rate is 11.3 per-
cent. Thousands who have given
upseeking employment or do not
qualify for unemployment benefits
are not counted in the official rate.
On top of this, tuition will cer-
tainly be rising in the fall.

The Times article quoted Dr. E.
J. Bloustein, president of Rutgers
as saying, “To call what is happen-
ing to student aid a calamity is an
understatement". I agree. The
G.S.L. is not a gift of money to
students. It is a loan. Without that
loan, quite a number of us are not
going to be able to afford continu-
ing our educations at Pitt. Arid
Pitt’s tuition is not unreasonable
compared to other schools. Being
self-supporting, I worked long and
hard for the chance to dy at Pitt.
It’s rather depressing to have to
drop courses I still have to pay for
in order to seek employment which
I know is not available right now.

Secretary of Education Terrel H.
Bell has called the cuts in the edu-
cation budget “...fair in coinpari-
son to the cuts in other
departments." This comes from
the man whose department has
been threatened with dismantle-
ment.

What can be done? Monday,
March l, has been designated a day
of student mobilization to protest
severe cuts in both grants and loans
for higher education. The students
of Pitt can add their collective voice
to that protest by calling or writing
representatives,- senators and the

   
 

governor. You can be part of the
human capital or you can be part of
the growing unemployment rate.

Allocate Loans
On Basis of
Need and Merit

Dear Editor:

Student loans are not a matter of
“shoulds,” but of economics. In
good times, society can contribute
more to the education of its
members. In bad times, scarce
resources translate into less for
students.

Following this rule of econom-
ics, President Reagan proposes to
do away with most of the student

loan program. But the economifw
5 rule he forgets is that not every do'l'— ’

lar buys as much as every other.

 Rather than merely hacking away
W», at the budget, Reagan should be

looking to find the best uses for
government money.
If we can’t afford to pay for every-

I one to go to college, then the time

has come to reform, not waste the
idea away. Counting returns, what
society gets from investing in the
education of a doctor, lawyer,
scientist, or professor is far more
than what went in, not to mention
higher tax revenues owing to
higher incomes.

Recently, need has been the only
basis for doling out student loans.

A better, more efficient syst 

would be to allocate these loa
according to a combination of need
and merit. If you can’t afford to
back all bets, at least back your best
bets.

  ‘Radical Chic’ Coalition

Challenges Young G.O.P.

Dear Editor:

In regards to the letters written
by the two Young Republicans
that appeared in the Feb. 5 Pitt
News, we, a coalition of the “radi-
cal chic" element that are pandered
to by this paper wish to respond.

ll‘ Republicans on this campus
wish to act in zi sophomoric way by
alluding to the U.S. Constitution
as making explicit provisions for
the forming of any political par-
ties, they may continue to do so;
but if they wish for the students of
this university to understand their
apparent wisdom, we have a
proposition.

.\s stiitleiits who l(‘ll(l to \'l(‘\\'
matter in a liberal—not radical—-
\'l(‘\\'[)()llll. we are open to your
ideas. if you can persuzule us to be
so. We don't think you can . how-
ever. In light of this, \\'t'ilSl\' you for

the chance to establish some type of I

question and answer period, to be
held before our peers at a later date
set by mutual agreement. At that
time we can deal with pertin M
issues, i.e., not clothes.

V We challenge you to defend your
positions, or to at least let them be
known. By so doing you would
gain back some of the credibility
you lost by calling The Pitt News
garbage, After all, is it not a fact
that your leters were printed? We
would think that in itself is proof
of the editors’ objectivity.

flay scon omen

It’s closing in on tournament
time and the Pitt Panther basket-
ball team is becoming a force in the
‘Eastern 8 playoffs, as they man-
‘handled a Rhode Island team
plagued by foul trouble and a lack

of "bench strength 81-67 last night

at the Pitt -Field House.

Again, senior guard Darrell Gis-
sendanner’s presence on the court
sparked the Panthers after a less-
than-exciting opening seven min-
utesvwhere Pitt held alslimi l3-10
edge. Within four minutes, Gissen-
danner scored six points, dished
out two assists, created havoc in the
Rams’ backcourt, and brought out
some life to a morgue-like crowd of
2,457 and carried the Panthers to a
30-20 lead.

Pitt starting center Trent John-

--son decided to start playing hero

for a fleeting moment, hitting a
turn-around jumper and converted
a three point play after drawing
‘Michael Whiting’s third foul, then
stole the inbounds pass and hit on a
12-foot iu'mper. _

After Clyde Vaughan hit a 17-
footer with 14:59 left in the first
half to give Pitt a 39-24 lead, it
looked like the Panthers were off to

‘another .30 point rout‘ a la St.

Bonaventure. There was one prob-
lem; the offense forgot to put the
ball in the basket.

3 The only score Pitt had in nearly
five minutes was registered when
Gissendanner put in two’ free
throws at 3:30 ‘of_the first half.

\ Clarion State posed surprisingly
little problem for the Pitt Lady
Panther gymnastics team Wednes-
day. Pitt easily defeated Clarion
ll37.85 to 131.6, as the Lady Pan-
thers displayed several excellent
individual performances as well as

capturing first places in all four-

even ts.

The momentum for the Lady'-

Panthers started rolling in the first
event, the vault, as senior Holly
Martino posted a winning score of
9.05. A

According to Pitt head coach
Donna Sanft, “Holly is one of our
most consistent vaulters because of
her very good body control."

Martino was followed by senior
teammate Regina Carson in third
place with an 8.75 score.

“Our bar team did a lot Iretrirr
than it has in past meets,” said
Sanft. Pitt scored a 1-2-3 svmepon

shooting of Whiting, Rhode Island
cut a 15 point Panther advantage
down to a slim 41-36 lead :at
halftime.

One reason for the Pitt skid was
the control of the boards by the 6-8
center Houston. After’ Roosevelt
Kirby received his second foul at
the 12:35 mark Houston started to
tear up the boards.

“While Kirbynwas on the side-

-line, Houston went crazy,” Head
coach Roy Chipman said. “No one
was stopping him.”

Maybe no on but Kirby wa_s stop-
ping Houston, but Houston ended
up stopping himself due to foul
trouble. In fact, three starters
(Houston, Whiting and Terry Pitt-
man) were in .foul difficulties for‘
most of the second half while
Houston’s replacement, Wendell
Walters, picked up four personals.

Vaughan added‘ 1'0"‘ Rhode
Island’s problems as he was able to
control the inside game in the
second half. The 6-4 sophomore
snatched ll of hiscareer-high 19
rebounds in the final stanza while
drawing enough fouls to go to the
line 15 times, making 10 free
throws en route to his game-high
24, points.

The first three minutes of the
second half told the story; the
Panthers were going to establish
control over the game. A Wallace
lav-up off a feed from Gissen-
danner, two free throws by
Vaughan and one by Gissendanner
and Pitt had a comfortable ten
point bulge.,_When Kirby scored on
a lay-up and drew Houston’s
fourth foul, it spelled doom for the
Rams, __ -

Even when Rhode Island cut the
lead to eight with two Houston lay-
ups and Pappy Owens tip-in off a
rebound, the spread offense Pitt
installed proved to be too much to
handle. After Pitt called a timeout
at the 5:18 mark, Vaughn was able
to hit three layups off the spread
and by the two minute mark Pitt
held’on a comfortable 14-point
margin, and the game became
sloppy as both teams emptied the
benches. _ .

Chipman had plenty of praise
for Vaughan, who has quickly
become one of the premier players
of the Eastern 8.

“Clyde was awesome tonight,”
Chipman said. “He played as well
as he could. The key to his success
if his confidence. He may be only
6-4 but his arms are as long as
anyone’s. He has a knack of getting

ed by the exceptional performance
of sensational sophomore Lisa
Shirk.

Shirk’s first place score of 9.4
clearly demonstrated that she is,
recapturing the high caliber form
which earned her All-America
honors last year.

Senior Roxanne Evans took
second with a score’ol‘8.75 and
junior Gretchen Spiech completed ‘
the sweep with a third-place score
of 8.6.

The balance beam was a dupli-
cate of the uneven bars, as once
again the Lady Panthers captured
all three top finishes. Carson, with
a “clean. and almost flawless” rou-
tine. according to Sanft, placed
first with one of her season’s best
scores, a 9.l5, followed by Martino
in second and Karen Martin in
third.

According to Sanft. “Karen had
probably the -cleanest routine, if it
wasn't for her one fall her store
would have been up in. the n.i.m:es.."

“It’s going to be a tough one,”

sidering only two weeks ago she
was hampered by a torn quadricep
muscle in her left leg.

The Lady Panthers‘ next meet is
next Saturday, Feb. 27, against the
West Virginia Mountaineers. The
much-improved West Virginia
team has posted a “very tough score
of H1" which will be difficult to
beat. However, with an increas-
ingly; healthier lineup and perfor-
mances such as Wednesday's, the
Lady Panthers too will not be so
easily conquered.

Gissendanner

  Sparkles

By BARRY ZASLOFF

Will someone please-explain the
difference between basketball and
track to Panther guard Darrell
Gissendanner?

Once again last night, the senior
co-captain parted from the Pitt
bench and turned a basketball
game into a track meet. He gave life
to a previously dead team, and he
kept the yawns from a sparse Pitt

de Island

Field House crowd of 2,457 to a
minimum. And in the end, he once
again ‘proved to be‘the Panther
spark-plug, running the Panthers
to a 81-67 win over. Eastern 8 foe
Rhode Island.

Following the game,
Island coach Claude English
acknowledged Gissendanner’s
speed by referring to him as “the
bullet”. He discussed the outstand-
ing play of Panther forward Clyde
Vaughan, who connected for 24
points while grabbing 19

‘rebounds, but declared Gissen-

danner the key to thegame.

“He was the differente,” said
English. “He was all over us defen-
sively. He just took us out of the
game.”

Gissendanner entered the game
after 6215 had elapsed in the first
half. The Panthers led by four, but
resembled a listless group of five
individuals playing anything but
team ball.

That changed rapidly. Midway
through the first half, the Panthers
ran to a 12-point lead. Gissen-
danner made his mark. He consis-
tently deflected passes, throwing
Rhode Island’s offense into sham-
bles. He ran by defenders with the
greatest of ease, leaving them
grasping at air. Head fakes right
and left, followed by a few steps in
either direction accounted for his
13 points and seven assists. But
p{Jint..and assist totals cannot accu-
rately describe Gissendanner’s per-
formance.

“I don’t care how many point
Darrell scores,” said Panther coach
Roy Chipman. “Hisjob is to come
into the game and stir things up.
That's exactly what he did
tonight.”

About here must be raised the
question of why Gissendanner
does not start the game? Certainly
he has the credentials to lead an
offense. He has that inate ability to
tear apart any team's game plan, as
he did to Rhode Island.

“Darrell is more valuable to us
off the bench, which makes him
appear that much quicker. When
they see a reserve guard replacing a
starter, the natural tendency is to
let up. That’s when Gissendanner
is most valuable to us.”

And that’s when the track meet,
or rather
becomes exciting.

  Men Eye
_,-‘Nationals

By MIKE ROSE

Three Pitt Panther gymnasts
will try to boost their season scor-
ing averages with an ‘eye on

Championships when the Pan-
thers meet Cortland State and State
University of New York at Farm-
ingdale Saturday.

Pitt’s Bob Besong, Dave Smith
and Frank Kratz are all within
reach of qualifying for the NCAA
National Championships for the
second consecutive year. Besong,

_"°:)gt:h0 qualified last year in the floor

7’ exercise, is a potential national
'qualifier in the high bar and floor
again, with an outside shot at qual-
ifying in the all-around, vault, and
parallel bars.

Smith is also within reach of
qualifying again in the floor exer-
cises, and Kratz has a chance to go
to nationals again in the vault, and

_ possibly the parallel bars.

/ Unlike the NCAA women's
gymnastics, the men’s division
does not determine its national
qualifiers based on a regional
pionship meet. Rather, a regional
committee extends bids to gym-
nasts based on their individual sea-

. n scoring averages. All three Pitt

%mnasts, especially Besong, rank
near the top of the East in their
respective specialties.

In tomorrow’s meet at SUNY-
Farmingdale, Pitt Coach Frank
D’Amico ex-pects little trouble

I ’ escaping with a win, even though
the Panthers enter the meet miss-

V ing two regular performers.

Brian Balk suffered severely

‘ strained ligaments in his right

3 knee while tumbling in practice
earlier this week and is expected to
be out for at least two weeks. Balk is
expected to be replaced in the floor
exercise by freshman Dave Lucas,
who has competed just once this
season.

A Pitt will aslo be without fresh-
gran John Gartside in the high bar.

qualifying for the NCAA National.

Besong hope

Gartside suffered a bone bruise on
his heel while practicing a dis-
mount from the bar when his foot
landed between two mats and
struck the hardwood floor. Gart-
side is also expected to be out of
competition for two weeks.
Fortunately for the Panthers,
neither Cortland State nor Farm-
mgdale pose a strong threat to pull
an upset. Cortland State has been
scormg an average of 240 points
this season compared to Pitt’s con-
sistent 255 and over scores. Farm-

ingdale has averaged a measly 170
points per meet this season.

Despite the disparity in ability, if
the scoring averages are any crite-
ria, Pitt Coach Frank D‘Amico still
has a small measure of uneasiness
about Cortland State.

“Cortland State will be gunning
for us because we are getting a good
reputation," D’Amico said. “Peo-
ple want to beat us because it looks
good to beat Pitt.”

Statistics, it seems, would ensure
Pitt's image will remain intact.

Lady Panthers Lose
To Georgetown

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

The Pitt Lady Panther basket-
ball team, plagued by cold shoot-
ing and costly turnovers, fell to the
Georgetown Lady Hoyas Wednes-
day, 79-67.

The loss dropped the Lady
Panthers to 14-12 this season and
further dimmed their already wan-
ing hopes for a NCAA playoff bid.

The Hoyas, who upped their
record to 9-14, finished with three
players—Erin Reid, Diane Toliver,
and K.C. Comerford—scoring in
double figures as the team recorded
its third consecutive victory. Reid
led all scorers with 17 points, Tol-
liver added. 16 points and eight
rebounds, and Comerford scored
14.

After jumping out to an early
16-12 lead in the first half, George-
town went on a tear, outscoring the
Lady Panthers 21-9.

Keying the outburst was the
Lady Hoyas’ halfcourt-trap

defense. The Hoyas pressure forced
numerous Pitt turnovers that
Georgetown converted into easy,
uncontested Iayups.

Pitt, meanwhile, was plagued by
torpid shooting in the half. Pitt
converted on only 12 of 34 field
goal trys in the half when the Lady
Panthers did manage to push the
ball upcourt. By the half, George-
town had put the game effectively
out of reach, 45-27.

The second half featured more of
the same cold shooting for Pitt,
which finished the game hitting
just 37.5 percent of its shots from
the floor. For Georgetown, it was
the team’s fifth win in the last six
games since regaining the services
of 6-3 Allison Westbrook, a fresh-
man from nearby Steel Valley High
School and Homestead, Pa.

Although the Lady Hoyas record
this year is a disappointing one,

Injured Wrestlers Ret

By TIM DINGER

The Pitt Panther wrestling
squad closes out its dual meet sea-
son this Saturday when it hosts the
Clarion State Golden Eagles. The
return of several injured Pitt start-
ers could be enough to put the
Panthers back on the winning
track after their loss last week to
Penn State.

At 118 pounds, Rich Esswein (4-
10) will tangle with tough Jamie
Kasser, while at 126 pounds, the
Panthers will put Joe Throckmor-

ton (15-6) back into action against
Eagle Kraig Nellis.

Craig Richey, at 134 pounds,
also makes his way back into the
lineup for Pitt to take on Bill
Arnold of Clarion.

The [42 pound match has yet
another Panther starter back and
ready to go as Jeff Gordon returns
to the mats to battle Clarion’s
Kenny Nellis.

At 150 pounds, injury-plagued
senior Mike Bond of Pitt will be the

urn to ‘Face Clarion State

fourth Panther seeing his first
action in recent weeks. Bond is
scheduled to meet Scott Glass of
(llarion.

At l58, the Panthers have lost
Jeff Jelic (l5-2-l) to an injury.
Replacing him is a dependable
freshman, Doug Haines, who will
take on either Todd Housel or Rob
Albert, if Albert doesn’t move up to
167 pounds to replace Eagle "Jay
Sanders. _

Lady Swimmers Have
Easterns on Their Minds

‘By scon DELLETT

The Lady Panther swim team
will be in Upstate New York tom-
morrow to go against Syracuse in
the last dual meet of the season.
This meet means more than a tune-
up to four swimmers, who still
haven’t qualified for Easterns.
Tommorrow represents the last
chance for Lady Panthers Margie
Curry, Estelle Grant, Beth Hitch-
cock and Janine Scotti to reach this
goal, and coach Dave Belowich is

“hopeful” the swimmers can

/ 681-9243

qualify.

“We are using this meet to give
the people another chance to make
Easterns,” Belowich said. “They
swam well against Tennesse but
their times just fell short.”

Belowich is going to put the
swimmers at their best events tom-
morrow, instead of flip-flopping
the lineup like he has done in the
previous meets.

“I changed the lineups around
in order to give as much flexibility
to the team as possible," Belowich
said. “We give some people a
chance to qualify in their two or

three best events. Against Syracuse,
we will have people swim at their
specialty in order to prepare them
for Eastern and Nationals.”

Although Syracuse has only ten
people on the squad, Belowich
believes they will still give the Lady
Panthers a tough meet.

“Syracuse has a good team,”
Belowich. “They are similar to
West Virginia in that they don’t
have depth, but the difference
between the two teams is that Syra-
cuse has ten pretty good swimmers.
However, they "are not a
Tennesseef’

Panther lineup this week, will have
l() wait until near match time to
find out who his opponent will be.

At I77 pounds, either Jeff Wilps
or Frank Rich of Pitt will take the

mat against Clarion’s All-America _

Charlie Heller, while at I90
pounds. Pitt's Mark Rich will see
his first action in recent matches
against seventh-ranked Mark
Downing of Clarion.

At heavyweight, Panther Dennis
Atiyeh will be pitted against Eagle
Curt Olson to close out the night's

the previous two seasons, the
record is also deceiving. George-
town beefed up its schedule this
year, last three starters to injuries,
and proceeded to lose four games
this season by three points or less.

The Lady Panthers,somewhat of
a disappointment themselves after
last year's 25-8 mark, now travel to
Ohio State for tomorrow’s game
with the Buckeyes, a team that has
flirted with a Top 20 ranking all
season.

Ohio State, 17-5, clinched an
NCAA playoff spot last weekend by
winning the 1982 Big 10 Cham-
pionship tournament. The Buck-
eyes currently own a four-game
win streak and like Georgetown,
have won five of their last six
games. Several times this season
Ohio State has been ranked 19th or
20th, although they are currently
unranked.

Leading Ohio State in scoring
and rebounding is 6-2 center Mary
Spivak. The senior is averaging
14.1 points and 8 rebounds per
game this season. Close behind is
5-11 All America forward Amy

G. Tucker, the team’s second-leading

scorer with a 13.2 average.

Pitt and Ohio State have met six
times before, with the series cur-
rently tied ‘at three wins per team.
