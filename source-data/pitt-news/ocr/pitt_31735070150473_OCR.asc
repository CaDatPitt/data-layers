Today is the deadline for students
in the Dietrich School of Arts and
Sciences to apply for April 2013
graduation.

In order to graduate, all A&S
students who plan to complete
their studies in April must turn in
an application for graduation to
the Ofﬁce of Arts and Sciences in
140 Thackeray Hall by 5 p.m. The
necessary forms can be picked up
in that same ofﬁce. Forms turned
in after today will incur a $25 late
fee.

Turning in the graduation form
is the earliest step toward gradu-
ation for seniors. The next step
for impending graduates won’t

arrive until April when “Gradu-_

ation Central,” the University’s
one—stop shop for graduation sup-
plies, opens in the William Pitt
Union several weeks prior to the
ceremony. There, students will
receive directions for the gradu-
ation ceremony, as well as be able
to purchase their caps and gowns.
Also available for purchase are
graduation announcements, class
rings and diploma frames.

The University-wide com-
mencement ceremony at the Pe-
tersen Events Center is scheduled
for April 28, 2013.

Pitt student opens hookah bar in Oakland
Student,  /mm t/ae ins and outs ofmnninga business

Pete Blais
Staﬁ'Writer

The best way to learn about
business practices is to just
open a business. At least that’s
what Pitt junior Soumar Dauod
thought when he decided to open
a hookah bar with his friend last
‘month.

So, with help from his parents
and the partnership of Califor-
nia University of Pennsylvania
graduate joud Mansour, Daoud
opened Mint Hookah Bar and
Lounge — located at 416 Semple
St. —- which held its grand open-

ing Oct. 26.

Just like the bar itself, the
owners behind it are new to the
world of business.

Mansour, 23, who earned a de-
gree in business and worked as a
BMW salesman for the past year
said he has fulfilled a life—long
dream of becoming a business
owner. A 23-year-old entrepre-
neur might seem a bit young, but
Mansour is the elder of the two
partners. Daoud, 21, is studying
Industrial Engineering.

The two met by accident at a
hookah bar at the beginning of
last fall semester. It was only af-

ter the meeting that the two dis-
covered several mutual friends
and even a family connection —
Daoud’s father knew Mansour’s
grandfather. Mansour moved to
Pittsburgh from Syria at age 8,
while Daoud migrated from Syria
to the U.S. just three years prior
to beginning school at Pitt.

The business, the young men
said, emerged from the sole fi-
nancial backing of their parents.

Up a hill and down a winding road,
tucked behind a neighborhood of
houses mere miles from Pitt’s up-
per campus, 10th-grade students
are handed copies of the PSAT at
Pittsburgh University Preparatory
School at Margaret Milliones. But
there is just one problem — the
test is foreign to them.

Pitt junior and UPrep Mil-
liones tutor Cassie Chew recalled
a time when she stood in shock
as she found herself explaining
the importance of the test to the
students’ future admittance to col-
lege, only to be met with a bleak
response, as a UPrep student
looked at the test and ironically
responded, “Let’s be real here,
nobody here is going to college,”

The Pennsylvania System of
School Assessment has released
data showing performance in the
Pittsburgh Public Schools sinking
on yearly academic benchmarks.
To combat this trend and strength-
en academic help in the classroom,
Pitt students, like Chew, are pair-
ing with after—school and school-
day programs to tutor children
and improve academic perfor-
mance.

“I think it’s really helpful to
realize how lucky [Pitt students]
are to have the opportunity to get
a college education,” Chew said.

Mayor honors
Pitt for
community
service

Mahita Gajanan
Staff Writer

Mayor Luke Ravenstahl recognized and
thanked Pitt Thursday morning for its efforts
in coordinating and participating in United
Way’s annual Day of Caring and Pitt Make a
Difference Day.

As part of a televised ceremony, in which

Ravenstahl awarded six different organiza-;

tions and individuals, Pitt administration
members and students gathered in the may-
or’s chambers to hear a proclamation.

The proclamation established Oct. 19 as
“University of Pittsburgh Day of Caring” and
Oct. 20 as “Pitt Make a Difference Day,” as
Pittsburgh saw one of the largest community
initiatives on the two consecutive days in 2012.

“Through these two days of signiﬁcant
and impactﬁil voluntary service, Pitt gives

back to the community in which its faculty,
staff and students live, learn, work and play,”
Ravenstahl said, noting that the University
recognizes the entire city of Pittsburgh as a
part of its campus.

“Who says Pitt’s only in Oakland, right?”
Ravenstahl said.

According to Ravenstahl, more than 3,300
Pitt volunteers served on 88 indoor and out-
door projects inmore than 60 communities
and neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, including
the Hill District, Oakland, Squirrel Hill and
Bloomﬁeld.

Dean Kathy Humphrey accepted the award
on behalf of the University.

“Service, research and teaching are the
tenets of higher education, and we take the
tenet of service extremely seriously,” Hum-
phrey said.

Humphrey thanked the faculty, staff and
students for their work, noting that the value
of an education is important, because students

can play a signiﬁcant role in the communities.

“We are grateful that our students are will-
ing to invest today, not just in the ﬁxture, but
today, in the lives of others,” Humphrey said.

Mary Mallampalli, chair of Pitt Make a
Difference Day, recognized the joint effort
made by the community and by Pitt.

“We reached out to the community to ﬁnd
sites,” Mallampalli said of the work sites. “We
are very grateful to the city of Pittsburgh.” I

poultry business based in Damascus, Syria,
with several other locations throughout
the country.

“I helped them. ]oud’s family, they
helped him a lot. We are all together sup-
porting them, helping them, as much as
we can. This is a family business,” Fayez
Daoud said at Mint while visiting the U.S.

Soumar elaborated, saying that wealth
is shared among family members in Syria.
“In Syria, if your dad is a millionaire, you
also own the money. Your dad and you
are the same thing. We’re one family, we
help each other a lot. Never my dad told
me, take my money. It’s take your money.”

Fayez Daoud said he’s very proud and
supportive of his son’s undertaking. Sou-
mar Daoud also acknowledges the help
he’s received.

“A big thanks to my mom and dad,”
Soumar Daoud said.

Soumar Daoud cited the turmoil in
Syria as another factor in his decision to
start the business.

“Things in Syria are really bad, and my
dad’s business is very slow. I wanted to
help my dad in any way. This is my help,
by opening a small thing I know I can run,”
Daoud said.

But starting a hookah bar is no easy, or
cheap, undertaking. After approximately
six months of planning, Daoud and Man-
sour bought the property and began in-
stallments.

Fez Grill, a restaurant specializing in
Turkish food owned by Sinan Ucargonul,
previously occupied the Semple Street
property.

' And that was just the beginning. The

two also split the costs on a company

account of about $75,000, including a
smaller loan of about $5,000 from Fayez
Daoud, which all went toward start-up
costs. I

According to Mansour, these costs
alone were huge. ‘ =

“We re-did the whole storefront to
black granite. We wanted to give it more
of a modern look. We had to get a new
sign, new TVs, smoke sensors, we had to
call Pepsi and Red Bull to make the deals
with them, we had to get the DJ booth
custom built,” he said.

Rent for one month runs at $2,200.
Utility costs are currently unknown, as the
one-month period to measure expenses
has not yet elapsed. Based on numbers
from this past weekend and this week,
Daoud expects the two will soon be ready
to pay November’s rent.

The shop owns 70 hookahs —— 20 of
which feature two hoses — and offers
several different brands of tobacco, mostly
coming from the Middle East and pur-
chased from Pittsburgh dealers. Mansour
also said he and his partner chose to pur-
chase all hookahs of the same brand.

“Khalil Mamoon is a top name brand

imported from Egypt. The smoothness
of the hookah is completely different,”
Mansour said. i

In opening a hookah bar, other con-
siderations must also be made because of
tobacco sale and usage occurring within
the store. Correct paperwork with the
city and state must be obtained before
the business can be opened.

“First, you need a lawyer to get the
proper paperwork. You need certain per-
mits to be a hookah bar, because you’re
providing tobacco,” Mansour said.

Mansour described ventilation as the
other major obstacle the owners faced
in preparing their hookah bar for open-
ing day.

“Our biggest investment were these

“smoke eaters,” he said, pointing to two
largemetal squares above his head. “We

want to make sure no one comes in here
and is exposed to a major amount of smoke.
These can each handle 1,500 square feet.
This whole place is 1,500 square feet and
we have two,” Mansour said.

The two new businessmen had to get
the word out about the new hookah bar.

Eric Huntermark, ajunior at Pitt and
employee of the nearby Campus Deli said,
“[Mansour] came over to grab a sandwich
and he said, ‘Hey, come check us out.”’

like tests, is so irrelevant when you think
about all of these people who have lost hope
for the same opportunity. It makes you real-
ize how inappropriate our attitudes are.”

State—wide test scores determining
schools’ adequate, or inadequate, yearly
progress were released by the Pennsylvania
Department of Education Friday, Sept. 21.
The tests showed 39.1 percent of school
districts statewide failed to reach bench-
marks on adequate yearly progress, includ-
ing scores on state math and reading tests,
attendance and graduation rates.

In Allegheny County, four ‘districts
missed adequate yearly progress in 2011,
but the number rose to 17 in 2012. Pitts-
burgh was included among the districts
that did not hit the benchmark.

Erika ‘Gold, director of the Pitt UPrep

Partnership — a program that began in l

2008 and pairs about 60 tutors, all current
Pitt students or recent graduates, with ei-
ther a single or group of Pittsburgh Public
School students —— said that many factors

 cause,Pittsburgh schools not to make the

grade. Financial challenges in the district
g:ausin‘g instability in schools, continual
fstafftuprnover and student transfer, differ-

’en_t.s_cho._ol cultures and poorly assigned
teachers all contribute to the lack of school

achgievement and success.

{.  Gold. said that, in the current partner-
ship,ithe‘primary focus is on Milliones, but

that tutoring support has expanded this
year to other Hill District organizations,
including the Pittsburgh Miller African-
Centered Academy. She said that most
classes throughout Milliones have tutors
in them to work with students as needed,
but that the number of students with a tu-
tor can vary each day depending on student
need — including one-on-one, small groups
or whole—class support.

In the role of tutor, Pitt students help,

create a positive learning environment for
the high school students by stressing the im-
portance of striving for a college education.

Pitt Senior Ben Siegel, who assists Gold
in operating the recruitment initiative, said
the partnership with Pitt students is some-
thing the public schools needed. Siegel cited
the inefficiencies of large and growing class
sizes, which prevent students with strong
academic needs from receiving adequate
attention. - .

Siegel said that Pitt tutors make a sub-
stantial commitment of up to 10 hours of
weekly volunteering while working closely
with what he believes to be an “absolutely
underestimated” segment of the public
school population. V

“A lot of service organizations at Pitt try
to raise the cycle of low expectations [of
public school students] because it isn’t re-
ally expected that they’ll graduate,” he said.
“It’s not surprising when they fail, because
it’s an institutionalized perception that it’s
okay when they fail. This is a dangerous
position to take,- but it’s also an easy posi-

tion to take, because, in reality, scores show
that only something like half will pass and
graduate from high school.”

To Gold, a member of the Hill District
Education Council —— a group composed
of educators, community members, com-
munity organizations, ministers and others
interested in the educational futuI;e,,0f the
Hill District — the state-set goal of 100
percent proﬁciency in student performance
in the areas of reading and math by 2014 is
unreasonable.

“The state’s goal is unrealistic, consid-
ering where we are now,” Gold said. “It is
possible if some drastic changes happen,
but we are talking about two years and ex-
traordinarily low test scores.”

As an incentive for Pittsburgh public
school students who strive for academic
success, the Pittsburgh Promise was cre-
ated, and, in 2006, Mayor Luke Ravenstahl
and then-Superintendent Mark Roosevelt
announced their goals forthe program. The
Pittsburgh Promise aims: to help students
afford college and draw residents to the city.

The Pittsburgh Promise is funded by
corporations and foundations and began
in 2008 to provide up to $40,000 per stu-
dentin scholarships. Students qualify for
the scholarship as long as they meet certain
requirements, including minimum grade-
point average, school attendance rates, resi-
dency and admission into a postsecondary
institution in Pennsylvania.

Pittsburgh Public Schools, its “bold vision
is that at least 85 percent of our students
will graduate from high school, and at least
80 percent of our graduates will pursue
and complete some form of postsecondary
education.”

According to a district report card is-
sued by the Pennsylvania Department of
Education to the Pittsburgh School District
for the 2011-2012 school year, the current
graduation rate is 68 percent.

To increase graduation rates and prepare
students to apply for the Pittsburgh Prom-
ise, Gold said Pittsburgh public schools
must continue to strive for a positive learn-
ing environment that is “conducive to un-
derstanding and learning through building
relationships and having high expectations
for all.”

“If a teacher doesn’t have a connection
with the community or with students, then
student behavior tends to follow the saying:
Students don’t care what you know until
they know that you care,” Gold said.

Gold said that student-and-teacher rela-
tionships, as well as tutor—and—student rela-
tionships, are crucial but can be negatively
affected when teachers don’t challenge their
students to rise to the occasion and suc-
ceed. This dynamic might result, she said,
when teachers are “dropped” into schools
due to school closings, consolidations and
teacher cuts.

of Mint along with fellow junior friend,
Steve Oldrati, sees potential in the busi-
ness and said it compares favorably with
other hookah-smoking experiences he and
his friend have had.

“In terms of quality, so far, so good.
It’s new, but hopefully that will continue,”

Oldrati said.

The owners chose the Oakland location
speciﬁcally to tailor their business plan to
the student population.

“Our whole goal is to give students
somewhere to come during the week
to hang out and study where it’s a quiet‘
coffee—shop type of experience, with hoo-
kah,” Mansour said. He added, “Then,
we wanted a place on the weekend where
freshmen, sophomores, juniors who are
under 21 who want to go out to a place
to dance, has a D], but they can’t go to
the bars.” _

Mint has already proved it can attract
college students to its location.

On a recent Monday evening, a dozen or
so mostly college-aged people waited out
the remnants of Hurricane Sandy, puffing
shiny hookah pipes in a colorful open room
full of round table tops and wooden chairs.
The light-green walls held two large ﬂat-
screen TVs, one on each side of the room.
A counter at the front displayed menus of
various-tobacco flavors and other refresh-
ment options. A fully equipped DJ booth
sat vacant off to the right side — instead,
light background music came from sur-
rounding speakers. The furniture looked
new, the people looked content.

Mint also offers a BYOB opticinfor cus-
tomers age 21 and older. ’ I  1

While the business life is new to the
two young entrepreneurs, a hookah bar
certainly isn’t new to Oakland.

, Ramy Andrawes, owner of Sphinx Cafe
— the only other hookah business in South
Oakland — seemed unconcerned with how
much Mint could potentially affect his
business. ‘

“I’ve beenin business for 10 years.
They’ve been in business for three days,”
Andrawes said. “A business should take
some time. Their business is too young
to judge how it’s going to be.”

Andrawes also said the two owners,
both former customers of his location,
said they have chosen a different model for
their business than what he offers. Sphinx,
he said, is much more-mellow in terms of
atmosphere, and doesn’t partake in any
weekend club affairs, whereas Mint plans
to offer a DJ for entertainment. Sphinx
instead features floor seating, tapestries
and an extensive drink menu.

“I’m not just a hookah bar; people come
for other stuff. I have drinks that no one
knows how to make on the whole east
coast,” Andrawes said. ’

An undertaking such as the one that
Daoud and Mansour have taken might
seem like a big step for a student or young
adult in their early twenties, but neither
Daoud nor his father see it that way. Fayez
Daoud sees Soumar’s business as merely
the beginning for his son.

“Right now, it’s a start, so he can learn
about a business: how to treat employees,
how to manage a place. You have to start
somewhere,” the elder Daoud said. I

working to increase teacher effectiveness
through a partnership between the teachers
union and the school district. The union and
district devised an evaluation system that
has been looked at nationally as a teaching
evaluation model._ ‘

“It takes time and years to go through
this process of determining who the effec-
tive teachers are, but a lack of achieving
[Adequate Yearly Progress] is partly because

we are still in the process of moving ineffec- —

tive teachers out of the district,” she said.
“Research shows that students who are the
most marginalized and underserved need
the most effective teachers in their classes.”

Chew said that tutoring is important for
Pitt students to develop a broader outlook
and todeepen their connection with the
community.

“If I didn’t [tutor], I would still be in that
suburban bubble that I came from,” she said.

Gold said that the hours she spent tutor-
ing -marginalized students were the best-
spent time of her week, and that University
student involvement is also applicable to
one’s future.

“I’ve done plenty of hiring, and, from

a hiring standpoint, I can tell you that it
means a lot to future employers for tutors
to have this kind of work experience,” Gold
said. “It can make the difference in getting
hired, as it says a lot about the broader ex-
periences and worldview and character of
the applicant.” .

S . Gold said that the Pitt Uprep Partnership

still has a need for tutors and that interested I
[ students are-always encouraged to contact

Anna Delaney, the UPrep tutor coordinator,
to get involved with the partnership.

Students who currently participate in
the UPrep program testify to the effect this
experience has had on their world outlook.

Siegel referenced an eye-opening experi-
ence he had during the summer discussing
humanitarian efforts and water shortages
in Africa with young students at a summer
camp. Unsure they would respond to the
issue, he was surprised when many of them
engaged in brainstorming solutions to the
problem.

“I left that experience thinking how with
it they all were as they were caring for others
in need when they had their own problems,”

he said. “There is a danger in thinking of‘

these kids as at-risk youth because, if people
label them like that, the students may begin
to settle for that label. But the thing is, they

can think, they care for others and they can 9

really impress you.” I

the pumpkins and closet the cos-
tumes. Then, Santa Claus attacks

 

us. All of November becomes an
extended Christmas Eve. We have
skipped Thanksgiving.

I’m not looking for this just
yet. I haven’t gotten my reprieve
from the semester during Pitt’s
Thanksgiving “break.” Talk to me
after that. It’s too soon for the ex-
citement.

It’s surprising. America, the na-
tion in love with eating, has forgot-
ten about the one day every year
when we forget about dieting and
totally gorge ourselves. It can’t be.

But it is. Annually, we nosedive
into the Christmas spirit and for-
get about the month of November
entirely. Sure, this is a huge capi-
talist push. Once the stores start
considering the time of year to be
“the holiday season,” our wallets
are opened, letting our dollar bills
ﬂy free and our credit cards hit the

 

 

monthly maximum.

According to Gallup polls and
comScore researchers, Americans
spent $25 billion between Black
Friday and approximately two
weeks before Christmas. With
things like “Cyber Monday” rak-
ing in online sales of more than
$1.18 billion alone, the expression
“it’s like Christmas came early”
is almost too literal for retailers.

Admittedly, even if you don’t
celebrate Christmas, the season
is still one that is associated with
happiness, giving, generosity and
love, despite the cold and dreary
days that we have here in Pitts-
burgh. A

Pitt is a happier place during
a time associated with ﬁnals and
all-nighters at Hillman Library.

LETTER To THE EDITOR

Dear Pitt News:

In your Nov. 5 editorial, The
Pitt News incorrectly stated: “As
a state—related institution, Pitt is
allowed relatively little direct over-
sight. As of now, the University 
is subject to no state audits, and
is only required by law to provide
a few top salaries and broad rev-
enue and expenditures through
IRS form 990.”

To the contrary, the University
is subject to a long list of disclosure
and audit requirements mandated
by state law which are in addition
to the disclosures required of the
University under the Right-to-
Know Act.

Beyond the discloures made
annually by the University under
Pennsylvania’s Right—to—Know Law,
other disclosures included an ex-
tensive ﬁnancial report ecompass—
ing budgeted and actual expenses
and revenue throughout the Uni-
versity. The University must also
disclose a list of all purchases of
goods and services which exceed
$1,000. These disclosure require-
ments, codiﬁed in Pennsylvania’s

. School Code, also include extensive

information on faculty and staff,
mean and median salaries, work-
load and other data.

The annual bill which autho-
rizes Pitt’s funding also provides
for yearly audits of‘ University
expenditures and costs by Penn-
sylvania’s Auditor General, and
requires the University to submit
extensive informationon faculty,
staff, undergraduate and graduate

populations, student credit hours
and much more.

This isjust a sampling of maj or
disclosure items submitted by the
University. There are many addi-
tional reporting requirements to
both Pennsylvania and the U.S. De-
partment of Education, including
crime reporting, voluminous insti-
tutional data submitted to the Inte-
grated Post—Secondary Education
Data System, annual submission
of program and operating budgets
and transfer credits, to name just
a few. In addition, the University
provides annual audited ﬁnancial
statements and other disclosures
that are independent of state or
federal mandated reporting.

Taken together, these disclo-
sures provide extensive detail on
how the University spends the
Commonwealth’s appropriation.

Unfortunately, in the discussionof -‘
the Right-to-Know Law, themedia

has continually focused solely on
the reporting obligations of state-
related universities contained
within the Right-to-Know Law. As a
cursory review reveals, in addition
to disclosures under the Right—to-
Know Law, there are extensive and
revealing mandated ﬁnancial and
other disclosures made by the Uni-
versity which provide a very ﬁill
and complete picture of how the
University spends its Common-
wealth ﬁinding.

Sincerely,

Paul A. Supowitz .

Vice Chancellor for Governmental
Relations

ECKROATE

Soon enough, there will be roaring
ﬁres in the Cathedral of Learning
Commons, Room and even more
dorm windows will be lined with
Christmas lights than what we’d
normally see any other time of
year. There are great aspects of

a this season, and nobody can deny

it.

For example, I love Christmas
music. With the local station play-
ing seasonal classics 24/7 from the
day after Thanksgiving onward,
I can surely get my ﬁx of my fa-

I vorites. Using Internet radio sta-

tions such as Pandora allows you
to pick your holiday music based
on not just your favorite song, but
even your favorite version of that
particular song. It’s as though the
season is catering to us.

I’m no grouch. I do have a heart.

But lets keep Christmas con-~

ﬁned to December. Let it cater to
us for the entirety of the month.
OK, I’ll even let it start in the last
week of November. Even with this

ed almost 10 percent of the days of
the year. I’d say that’s a fair enough
percentage, considering there are
only 12 months in a year. Allocate
your seasonal cheer equally.

The holidays give us a warm

We should
start with the
similarly warm

and fuzzy

feeling of
understanding
how fortunate ,
we are.

and fuzzy feeling, I know. It’s the
smell of those roasted nuts at the
mall kiosks that smell better than

they taste. There are the red cups A

at Starbucks, everything is pep-
permint ﬂavored and everyone

limit, the holiday festivity is grant- is sporting a lovely pea coat and

scarf. V

But the real reason why we
should slow down is because we
should start with the similarly
warm and fuzzy feeling of under-
standing how fortunate we are.

For the month of November, be
thankful for what you have. Try to
ignore the economy, unemploy-
ment and student loan concerns
for a minute. Consider what we
do have rather than what we don’t.

If you’re reading this article at 

all, you arefortunate enough to
be part of the 83.7 percent of the
literate world population. This
means that the number of illit-
erate adults in the world is more
than double the population of the
United States. It’s humbling,,isn’t
it?

The stores might be leading us
into the joy of the holidays so soon
for their own beneﬁt, but before
we enjoy the positives of the sea-

son too quickly, spend November ‘

recognizing the many beneﬁts in
your life. After just an ounce of re-
ﬂection, feel free to proceed in the
caroling and eggnog consumption.

Coming off a heartbreaking triple-overtime
loss at Notre Dame, the Pitt football team
must regroup and earn a vital road victory
if it hopes to move up the conference stand-
ings and keep its bowl hopes alive.

Searching for their second Big East win
of the season, the Panthers (4—5, 1-3 Big
East) travel to Rentschler Field in East Hart-
ford, Conn. to face the struggling UConn
Huskies (3-6, 0-4 Big East) at 8 p.m. Friday
night. The game will be televised on ESPN 2
and streamed on WatchESPN.com.

The game comes less than a week after
Pitt saw a 20-6 advantage evaporate in the
fourth quarter as the Panthers dropped a
29-26 decision to undefeated Notre Dame in
one of the most suspenseful games college
football has seen this year. '

Following the wild contest, Pitt redshirt
sophomore ‘linebacker Eric Williams knew
the Panthers needed to move on quickly,
because they still,have three crucial games
remaining, starting with Connecticut.

“The only thing we can do is pack it up
and move on to the next game and not hang
our heads,” Williams said. “We have UConn
next week and we have to start preparing
for them.”

Although his squad blew a big opportu-
nity to knock off an undefeated top—ﬁve
opponent, Pitt head coach Paul Chryst was
still proud of his team’s effort. .

“Recapping Saturday’s game, I’m awfully
proud of the guys —— players and coaches

 MEN’S BASKETBALL

Panthers begin new season with Mount St. Mary’s matchup

 

Nate Barnes
Stajj” W riter

After the most disappointing season in
recent memory, the Pitt men’s basketball
team is ready to get back on the floor and
prove that last year’s struggles were a
fluke.

Hoping to begin a new campaign on
a positive note Friday against Mount St.
Mary’s, the Panthers seek their 16th con-
secutive season—opening victory when they
host the Mountaineers at the Petersen
Events Center at 6 p.m.

The Mountaineers also want to improve
this year after ﬁnishing last season with
an overall record of 8-21 and a 6-12 mark
in the Northeast Conference. The program
from Emmitsburg, Md. has a new head

coach injamion Christian, but Mount St.
Mary’s also returns four of its top ﬁve scor-
ers from last season.

For Pitt, head coach Jamie Dixon not
only wants to win the game, but he also
wants to see continued improvement from
the Panthers.

“No one is playing really where they
want to be this time of year,” Dixon said to
the media Wednesday. “There’s certainly
room for improvement, no question.”

Although these Mountaineers-might
not pose as great of a challenge to the Pan-

thers as a more familiar form of Mountain- ‘

eer from West Virginia would, Pitt can’t
afford to play poorly if it expects to begin
the season with a victory.

Junior guard Julian Norﬂeet, who led
the Mountaineers in scoring last season at

13.7 points per game, returns this season
along with three of the team’s other top
players — senior forward Raven Barber,
sophomore forward Kelvin Parker and
junior guard Josh Castellanos.

Barber finished third on the team in
scoring at 9.2 points per game, while
Parker averaged nine points per contest.
Castellanos notched 8.1 points and a team-
high 4.6 assists per game last season.

But Mount St. Mary’s will also find itself
with a void to fill in the post, having lost
their leading rebounder from last season
— Danny Thompson, who pulled down 6.9
rebounds per game. No other player on the
Mountaineers roster grabbed more than
4.6 boards per game last season, and if
Christian’s squad hopes to keep this game
close, it will need someone who can chal-

lenge Pitt’s talented frontcourt.

Dixon acknowledged Wednesday that
freshmen Steven Adams andjames Robin-
son will start Friday, with Adams manning
the center spot for the Panthers.

“Steve needs some work defensively,

but Dante‘ [Taylor] is right there with him,” .

Dixon said. “Dante coming off the bench
is something we’re looking at.”

Complementing the depth at forward
will be redshirt junior Talib Zanna,’ who
looks much improved heading into this
season. But for the most part, expect Dixon
to use players such as ].J. Moore and Lamar
Patterson at the traditional power forward
position, while playing either Adams or ’
Taylor as the lone big man.

Panthers hope to start campaign with win over Penguins

Dave Uhrmacher
Staﬁ” Wrz'ter

Pitt fans are all too familiar with
what a Youngstown State Penguins
team can do to a team hoping to
pick up an easy win in the ﬁrst game
of the season.

A few months ago, the Penguins’
football squad came to Pittsburgh
and shocked the Panthers, silencing
a Heinz Field crowd that had been
expecting a comprehensive victory
for the home team.

Now the Pitt women’s basketball
team will hope to avoid the same
fate when it begins the regular
season on Friday morning attthe
Petersen Events Center, Tipoff is
slated for 11 a.m., as the Panthers
host students from local elementa-
ry schools for the annual Kids Day.

Pitt head coach Agnus Berenato
embarks on her 10th season as the
leader of the Panthers, needing just
seven more wins to become the pro-
gram’s all-time leader in wins.

The matchup with Youngstown
State marks the ﬁrst of six straight
non—conference home games to
start the regular season for the

Panthers. Pitt will not play a game
away from the friendly conﬁnes of

— the Pete until Dec. 1, when it visits

Lafayette.

Looking to start the season
with a win, Berenato and her staff
scheduled a full week of practice to
prepare for the Penguins. ' '

“We just have to make sure we
are working hard every posses-
sion,” Berenato said. “Their play
revolves around the perimeter, and
they like to shoot out of transition,
so we just have to keep our hands
up, grab some long rebounds and
get the ball" out in transition.”

Pitt will need to pla -well to
avoid an upset against You gstown
State. . ‘ ‘

The Penguins have improved
drastically over the past two sea-
sons under the direction of ‘head
coach Bob Boldon. The year before
Bo1don’s arrival, the team lost all 30
of its games. '

But with Boldon at the helm,
Youngstown State earned a com-
bined 16 wins in the last two sea-
sons, and the Penguins will hope to

Pitt senior point guard Tray Woodall
admitted that the guards need to feed
the ball to the Panthers’ gifted forwards
when possible. '

“Just got to make sure I’m ﬁnding those
guys in the right spots,” Woodall said.
“Deﬁnitely trying to make sure we feed
them when we’re open. Just try to make
good passes and make their game easier.”

Beside Woodall in the Pitt backcourt
will likely be Robinson, Whom Coach Dix-
on stated has earned a starting position
with his defensive ability.

“James [Robinson] could be our best
perimeter defender,” Dixon said. “He’s
strong, got good size, good quickness and
he has great lateral quickness.’

If Adams and Robinson do start for.

the Panthers Friday evening, it will mark
the first time Dixon starts two true fresh-
man in a regular—season opener and the
ﬁrst time two freshmen will start together
since the 2003-2004 season, in which Pitt
started Antonio Graves and Chris Taft in

a game against Virginia Tech.

The defense of Robinson -—— and Pitt as
a whole.—— will be put to the test by the
Mountaineers’ new style of play, which
ﬁrst—year head coach Christian has dubbed
“40 minutes of mayhem.”

“Our entire system is 40 minutes of
mayhem,” Christian said. “We want to
force offenses and defenses to earn every
inch against us.”

If the Panthers can deal with the may-
hem of the Mountaineers, it will be a good
start for a Pitt men’s basketball team re-
ceiving little recognition nationally.

But Coach Dixon has no problem with
his team flying under the radar entering
this season. He wants his team to earn
praise by performing on the court.

“We always come out with a motivation
hoping to prove we are a better team than
what people look at, and, in general, we’ve
done that,” he said. “We always believe we
can be as good a team as we want to be,
not based on predictions.” I

conﬁdence.

The Pitt defense ranks second in the
Big East in interceptions, led by redshirt
junior safety Jason Hendricks, who has
picked off four. If the Panthers can force
multiple turnovers, history shows that they
are likely to win, as Pitt boasts a 3-1 record
this season when forcing more than one
turnover.

And if the Panthers’ defense can get
the ball back, that will help the offense’s
ability to score points against the stingy
Connecticut defense.

A week after scoring 26 points on a
Notre Dame defense that previously hadn’t
allowed more than 17 in a game, Pitt quar-
terback Tino Sunseri and wide receiver
Devin Street will hope to continue their
blossoming connection in the passing
game. Thanks to his three 100-yard games
this season, Street leads the conference in
receptions and receiving yards per game
—- afeat no Pitt wideout has accomplished

“We just cannot allow them to get open looks.”

Although Youngstown State has increased
its offensive output by 16 points per game
over the last two years, the Penguins have
lacked the defensive prowess to stop teams.
The combination of a weak Youngstown State
defensive unit and strong guard play for the
Panthers should allow Pitt to light up the
scoreboard.

“Offensively, we really want to push in
transition, maybe get our guards a little more

. involved, and again get the post involved,”

since Larry Fitzgerald in 2003.

Senior Ray Graham and freshman Rush-
el Shell lead the Panthers’ rushing attack.
Graham ranks third in the conference in
yards per game and impressively ran for

172 yards last week against Notre Dame’s ‘

heralded front seven.

After tearing his ACL last year, Graham
now feels he is ﬁnally almost back to 100
percent.

“I’m feeling real good,” the senior run-
ning back said. “I think I’m improving game
by game, week by week.”

With Connecticut, Rutgers and South
Florida remaining on the schedule, Pitt
must win two of its ﬁnal three games to
become bowl-eligible and qualify for post-
season play for the ﬁfth consecutive season.

we are all ready for a fresh start after last
year,” she said. I
