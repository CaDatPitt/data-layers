THETA EDELTA PSI  RECOGNIZED BY UNI.

I The Theta Delta Psi Fraternity was
recognized by the University on Feb-
ruary 2. - Thislatest of Pitt’s campus
organizations‘ has an active member-
ship of 24, and is installed in a large
and handsome house at Amberson ave-
nue and Bayard street.

Theta Delta -Psi is the outcome of
zealous efforts putforth by a small
group of “workers who gathered to-
gether early last November under the
name of the X Y Z_ -Club. This handful
of friends, drawn together during their

ﬁrst years in school in lasting ties.
were determined to create something
new and big and strongand some-

thing that would help them to attain
certain ideals ﬁnd» aspirations that
they heldidear. :‘5‘It is to their honest
labors that the:-,University owes its
acquisition of theinew fraternity. Theta
Delia Psi was organized to bring about
a higher spirit. of comradeship among
its members, to? secure for them a
higher plane of scholarship, and to
aid them in attaining to lives of use-
fulness and respect. _ I
As yet the -organization is too young
to be able to record much of an his-
torical character. It -can only hope to
set down a few facts of enlightenment
as to its purposes and aims. The om-

University Should Have
“Law-Givers” On Faculty A

Writes Frank Ramsey, ’10

 

NUMBER TWO‘——Tl-TE ANSWER OF
RAMSEY, '10.

 

(Frank R. Ramsey, Mines, ’lO,
secretary New York Pitt Club, mem-
ber Alumni Council, year-in-and-yeah
out Pitt booster and worker.)

The University of Pittsburgh has
aspired to fulﬁll all the demands‘
made on the usual Americanuniver-A
sity and its fault, "if a fault, lies in
attempting too much, aiming too
high. The writer has made a con-
sistent effort to keep informed on
university matters and therefore pre-
sumes to reply to the questions re-
garding‘ aims by making some sug-
gestions._ . - '

Consider the university as a patient.

a symptom of a complaint which
might be termed “pernicious anaemia.‘
This seems to come from an attempt
to assimilate unhornogeneous masses
of variouslyprepared students with
faculty organs overworkedarfd under-
nourished with adequate salary, and
lacking new blood. Remedy suggested:
A careful regulation,‘of the diet,. (in-
coming students) and a, general
strengthening of the internal organi-
zation, -with appointment ofa “medicall
adviser” insthe form ofacloser alum-
ni co-opera‘tion—-a body like Hal‘-
vard’s_ Board of Overseers, to keep the
patient in health. _ A

First, among speciﬁc recommenda-
tions, the immediate raising of en-
trance requirements by insisting on
actual -. written -examinations. The
practice of recognizing secondary
school diplomas is generally bad and
should be limited.  g . — ’ , ,

Second, the tuition should be raised.
It has been ridicuouslyv low anda fur-
ther increase should be made. -The
purpose is not that education be made
imorje diﬁicult and out of the reach or
worthy but Aim-pecunious students, but

I

The present introspective tendency is

  
 
  

not, enough to exclude poorly pre-
paredstudents; equally important is
the enforcing of high standards -for
those admitted. A 60 per cent accur-
ate person in business receives scant
consideration, and the assumption that
a student of this calibre metamor-
phoses into a. 99 per cent man of af-
fairs is not to ‘be expected.

Fourth, teaching salaries must bein-
creased. However much conscien-
tious instructors are willing "to sac-
riﬁce luxuries to follow their profes-
sion, they are physically incapable of
giving their best efforts to teaching‘
while outside sources of income must

_be prosecuted. _ 1
Fifth, secure one BIG man for each

department. Some one said that
“every institution is the ‘lengthened
shadowof one man.” If department
be substituted for institution the
statement would hold for even greater
reason. A department will ‘respond
more readily to innovations. If Pitts-
burgh secures only one of the leaders
in a ﬁeld to hold a chair, the resulting
beneﬁts to the department and the
universitywill be more than gratify-

ing. To permit carying out this un-

dertaking certain least essential
courses might be eliminated. The
university has been guilty, well mean-
ingly, of trying to please and accom-
modate all who came, and this has
resulted "in dispersed effort and an ill-
advised diversion of funds never too
abundant. A few departments well
equipped and_ administered are in-
ﬁnitely superior to a department-
store theory of education.

. Sixth, we need a recognized and au-
thorized alumni bodzy, charged with
obligations to act and equipped with
power. Says Charles W. Elioton the
Harvard method: , P .

‘.‘Since 1866 the Overseers have been
elected by the alumni,’ 5 each year for
a. 6-year term. Their real" function is
to stimulate and ‘watch the President
and Fellowslpof-tithe.-E Corporation E

"TALK 0N WATER SUPPLY

Students and faculty of the School
of of" Chemist -were instructed at the
last assembly ; y a lecture delivered
by Superintendent Drake of the Pitts-
burgh ﬁltration plant, on “The City
Water Supply.” The superintendent
gave an outline of the different
methods of water puriﬁcation used by
various municipalities and told how
much progress had been made in
foreign countries and in other parts
of the United States.

Mr. Drake then gave statistics show-
ing that Pittsburgh water is in reality
about the‘ softest to be -found in any
municipal water system in the United
«States. According to Mr. Drake,
claims that the hardness of Pitts-burgh
water causes chapping are absolutely
unfounded, because the water is only
about one-third as hard during the
winter as durin-g the summer months,
when chapping is unknown.

ARE URGED TO
ATTEND S-TATE DEBATE

ALUMNI

 

Pitt and Penn State are to meet
again this week but the occasion will
not be of an athletic nature. In-
stead, the rival’ debating forces of
-the two schools will clash at the
Schenley ‘High School Auditorium
Friday evening, the subject for dis-
cussion ébeing, “Resolved, that the
United States shoul-d.— adopt a rigid
Japanese exclusion law (constitution-
ally conceded.) .
A special invitation is extended to
the alumni of Pitt to attend this de-
hate and it is hoped that‘ a. large
number of them will be out. The
men who represent Pitt on the debate
team are just as worthy of support
as the football, ‘baseball and other
athletic heroes. It takes nerve and
ﬁght to round ‘out a good debater,
just as ‘these characteristics are ne-
cessary to make a man successful on
the athletic field.‘ with solid Pitt
backing to support the Pitt debaters
against their-rivals, the chances for
success are all the brighter.

-Louis Dussere is manager of the
debate team and he has the co-oper-
ation of the Students Activities‘Com-
m-ittee of Alumni Council.

PITT-STATE DEBATE -

A Senator Hiram Johnson of California, a_nationally—
 known ﬁgure in politics and statesmanship, will be in our
5 midst‘ next Friday evening. The senator has consented to
’ act as honorary chairman at the Pitt-State debate at the

Schenley High School auditorium- Especial interest will

. be addedto the occasion because the subject to be debated

is the exclusion of the Japanese, a question that concerns

,Mr. Johnson, as representative of the people of California,

v‘ery much. ‘ I _
We are of the impression that a very pleasant and in-
structive evening can be spent at_ Schenley High ‘School
uditorium next Friday evening. Is it not possible fgo get
together a large body -of Pitt students at least once _or. an
affair of this kind? Most of us are every day missing
some of the real things of our college life. What could
have a more purely acad_emic savor than an inter—colle-
giate debate} And what would have a better effect upon
the distinguished visitor Friday night than a good att_end-
ance of students, intent upon hearing an intelligent dis-
cussionfof one of the country ’s vital problems‘? Whi.le we
are in school let us not neglect any of those things that
help to round out an education. If our lives and interests
have be_en lop-sided, let us attempt to remedy the defect
by making a new start Friday evening when a goodly pro-
portionshould surely hear the debating teams.

drew up to the visitors and the con-
test was nip and tuck up to the iﬁnal
whistle. lWith the score even Jordan
sent the sphere toward the victorious
goal as the whistle blew.

The big game of the week was the
W. & J. contest, which the Panthers
put on ice early in the game. AW. &
J. got off to a slight lead and held
their own to the end of the half. In
the second half, however, Pitt drew
ahead. In that period W. & J. failed
to score ‘from the ﬁeld. The team work
‘and general play of the Panthers was
the best seen here this -year. The foul
shooting on the part of both Carroll
and Jordan was spectacular, the for-
mer tossing 14 out of 15 and the latter
13, out of 15. Jordan was held to one
ﬁeld goal, due to the close guarding
of Kaiser- Byers and Clawson each
tossed four ﬁeld goals. Clawson out-
jumped Kemp Conn and Agave the
Panthers 3. big advantage. The victory
over W. & J. moved Pitt up, a peg in

fraternity series, thus far, was won
last Friday by the~Kappa S‘ig'S. Sigma

Three of the Kappa Sigs ran their
quarters under a minute, which is
high class time, while Sigma Chi and
Alpha Phi Alpha each had two men
in thatclass. Sheafs‘ time of :55 ﬂat

is the fastest quarter ever run on the
indoor track. Allen was less than a
second slower than ‘Shea and follow-

Hamilton, Fawcett and Rylander. The
quarters of Mandeville, Fawcett sand

Four games remain on the Panthers’

the stage this week. Tonight the

ﬁght. Their record so far this year
-has been "exceptionally good. -

Friday ‘night the return game with
W. & J. is played at Little VVashing-
ton. Pitt’s victory here last Friday
was notas easy as the‘ score would
indicate and W. & J. will put up a
lot harder battle on their own floor. A
number of Pitt students plan to fol-
low the team. Washington cars leave
Liberty and Grant every hour. It will
be-possible to return that night.
