remaining funds will be laid, before
a 'm~eevtin-g of the 'class,'itis _said.
The plan of disposing of this year’s

next year by-the senior

proﬁts follows that of last year, when ,

the funds _were also deposited with
the advisory board. In 1925, the last_
year that a junior classmade a de-
cision concerning the disposal of
proﬁts, over $300 was voted to the
Cathedral . of Learning, -a. small
amount being reserved to care for
expenses. The decisi-onwas‘ reached
in spite - of opinion favoring the
_granting'of the funds to the-prom

Disposal of proﬁts‘ realized from
the--1924 promvwas made only after
a hectic meeting of the class. Break-
ing .a. "precedent of several years’
standing in failing-to vote the p_ro-
ceeds to the prom comrnrittee, the
class"=decided«to place all money in
a memorial fund. At an earlier meet-

ing it. had been decided to donate the ’

proﬁts of the dance _,to the prom
chairman, but the decision was- over-

ruled‘. : During the second -meeting,

of— the clas-sia motion to grant "$250
to the, chairman was. killed, after

which it ‘was ‘decided to place the 2

money,» amounting to $600, in the
memori=al fund. Very‘ little ‘ discus-
sion was.aroused concerning the dis-
p,o'sal.of the proﬁts of ‘the 1923 prom,
the -entire ‘proceeds, amounting to
$217, being ‘immediately given over
to the promotion of -class activities.

Pittsburgh City Editors say » in "  2'

Education Is Asset
I STRESS BACKGROUND
‘Other things being equal a college

_ ‘man with a. “r.ose for news” makes _

a.‘ better reporter than one without
an education, in the opinion of Pitts-
burgh city adi-tors.

 "‘By all "means college, but after
graduation forget college,” is the

opinion .of D.. H. Fee, city editor of
th’e.Gazette Times. “A college edu-
cation is a.wonderful asset for it
smooths the way for a newspaper
reporter. The main requisites for a
good '.repo‘rter_ -are character, enthu-
siasm, industry, .-persistence, and
loyalty. A reporter must have a de-
sire to know-the truth, a. curiosity
as to the whyof everything. If pos-
sible,-cvery re; Jrter should get some
experience‘ on a small town paper,
for there he gets an all-around ex-
perience. He gets nearer to the
mechanical side of the paper, and
he learns accuracy. Brilliance is not
arequisit; for a good reporter but
he must have a sense of responsi-
bility,-e_n-thusia,sm,,a sense of matur-
ity,»and must not loaf.”

‘..‘It’s a -great life and a-lot of fun,

, but don’t go in the game for it is

a hard life,” was Fee’s parting ‘ad-
vice._
“A. reporter should not have a col-

I lege education,” is the decision of O.

J. Lancaster, city editor of the
Pittsburgh Sun. A college man feels
too superior to be a successful re-
porter. A newspaper office is not the
place for women, for the life is too
hard. .

. “The news instinct is the most im-
portant requisite for a reporter, for
Without that he is valueless,” he

' declared. Lancaster has had forty-

ﬁve years experience in the news-
paper game and it is his opinion that
no oneshould make it his life work,
although, he -thinks that it is good

training before entering other "fields. 

“He who gets drunk can not be a

reporter,” is theopinion of Mr. Ken-.

nedy-, city editor of the Chronicle-

Telegraph. The main requisitesfor
agood reporter are sobriety, a news ,

sense, a clean collar, the ability to
write straight English,-~ and to put
who, when, what,-where, and why

in -the lead. --If a. college man" has 
the news sense he_ is. more valuable,
“I think

than the uneducated man.
that the'Week_ly is good as college
papers go,” said Kennedy.

“The best reporter is not a college
graduate, but that doesn’t mean that
a college man can not be a good re-
porter,” says V 'lliam A. White, city
editor of the Pittsburgh Press.
“The most, important requisite for

a good reporter is a nose for news. A --

A college graduate with a nose for
news would be a ‘ etter reporter than

a‘ man without a higher education,’

for.his training gives him a back-

ground. A reporter must know the -
value of news and must be persist-

ent to. be successful. Te newspaper
game is great, and is lots of fun.
The Weekly is a very good paper,
I read it every week and enjoy it a

lot.”

‘ Numerals But Makes‘
Varsity

Although’ he never’ ‘earned his
freshman numerals, George Ko-
wallis just ended one of the..best
records ever made by arifvarsity
basketball ‘player. 4 ’

spite of his diminutive size.-=' ' — '
.Kowallis long ago discovered that
the ball. he was to‘ ‘play with was al-
9 most twice as big-as his head and
’ was a hard thing to grasp under
any condition. He was noth.in.g more
than  wee ihmite. He‘ surmounted
the difficulties "with. ‘a_1 sprightliness
th-at brought many smiles‘ to the
square ‘chins of the mill». workers
who hung out at Duquesne, where
.George was graduated from high
school in 1923;‘ ’ '
He" won his first laurelsi while-
playing - with” the-‘ Duquesne” high‘
quintet; 7\vh‘ere- he" -‘left  an: -all-time“
record of 118 fouls ‘outhof-142 tries
in one season. Although only a
“half-pint’? he also ‘played quarter-
back’ on the varsity football team.
. Before ,playing for the Dukes,
George‘ played four years asa mem-‘

ber of the Carnegie -‘library club, a‘

boy’s tea'm_ averaging thirteen‘ years”
in age, but whichlost but one game

. in two seasons. ' ' a
George had. a hard’ time making
the varsity team‘ at Pitt. « All

. ' through his freshman year he tried
' for the team but was steadfastly re-_-*
fused a; posi.ti_on- because of ='his_‘-
stature.” He is 'n.ot”a stockily-built

basketball‘ player and" ‘is modeled.
more on the Baby Peggy type. Dur-
ing theseason of 1924-25 Kowallis,
,9 with his ﬁghting persistently,_ﬁnally
 won a. berth as -forward. Sinceithenf
his name has graced 'everyi.varsit‘y_,
line~up. ’ ' — ' ‘

lead at the _end~o'f"the'-ﬁrst quarter,

ball with a spectacular game against-
State. at State college‘.  ' '

Kowullis and Wrobleski tied‘ for-"

the individual scoring honors of -the
past season with 131 points each,
but George led, ‘Stash’ from thepﬁeld

EN VIABLE PREP RECORD‘

Les Cohen, freshman football,
basketball, and track star, looms IS
the only three numeral man Pitt

played end on tho, undefeated Pitt’
freshman team, center and forward

pionship freshman basketball team,
and is likely to be a. weight man on
the track team.
_ Cohen made an enviable athletic
reputation for-himself before been-
tered Pitt. He was center on the
Uniontown basketball team of 1925
which won the championship of the
state. At the tournament. held at
State college he was chosen--tall-state
center. - ,

Uniontown entered the national

-tournamentat Chicago and survived

till the semi‘-ﬁnals when they fell be-'
fore the team which won the cham-
pionship of the country. Cohen’:
consistent playing, especially his
clever passing and‘ brainwork, was
responsible for his being picked all-
utilitynman on the 1925 All-Amen
ican basketball team. , ,

Cohen was second high scorer of
the basketball team that year, a few
points behind his ﬂashy teammate,
Hyatt. '

Besides playing end on the Union-
town football team, Cohen was cap-
tain and high scorer of the track
team, holding the Uniontown High
records in the shot-put and discus.
Lee was a consistent scorer in’ the
high hurdles, high jump and broad
Jump. He_ also engaged in swim-.
ming, holding the 40-yard swim rec-
ord at the Uniontown Y. M. C. A.

After high school Les Went" to
West Virginia university and played

ball team. He was captain and cen-
ter . of West Virginia freshman
basketball team. He managed to be
the high scorer on the basketball‘
team and was considered its best
passer and ﬂoor man. Les was also
a member of the snakes’ yearling
track team, being a consistent scorer
in the weight events. , ~

This year Uniontown’s pridercame
to Pitt along with his former team-
mate, Hyatt. Cohen played regular
end on the championship fresh‘ foot-

on the defense, Cohen was a. con-
stant menace on the offense through‘
his uncanny ability to catch forward"
pa.sses. Cohen scored a. brilliant
touchdown in the Bellefonte game by
knocking the ball out of Hood’s hands
and then scooping it up and running
for. a touchdown, one of the out-
standing plays of the freshmen sea.-

Start Survey To Interest

ing professions, in responseto re-

school of mines and engineering, in
a series of professionalstudy leaf-
lets, is attempting to bring various
aspects of the profession before high
schqol students of \-.IesternI Pennsyl-
Vaflla. The -leaflets have been
edited by F. L._ Bishop, dean of the
mines and engineering schools, and
IE. G. Hill, professor of metallurgy.

Starting" with a deﬁnition of the
profession, each leaflet dwells on
duties, professional knowledge, edu-
cation required, compensation and
other aspects. A short analysis
compiled from— records of former
graduates is set forth in each leaf-
let ‘together with a bibliography of

I“In Ia‘ series of nine booklets, such
professions’ as the mechanical, in-
dustrial, chemical, electrical, indus-
trial, civil rnd metallurgical
engineer _are discussed.‘ Special
bound copies of the nine booklets

have been" Idistribu,ted_ to school
heads, while individual copies are
available to students. In’ I many

schools, the leaflets are used in
classroom work as a basis of voca-
tional study. In nearly every case,
several demands have been made
to the department for ’ additional
booklets, it is reported. Efforts to

all Ischools, but also in homes,‘ are
being made, those in charge of cir-

Specialization CripplesI
Us lntellectual1y——Ainos

, That modern specialization makes
intellectual cripples of all of us, was
the declafation of Dean of Women,
Thyrsa W. Amos, commenting on the
results of an inquiIry conducted last
week among Pitt students to discov-
er just what students read.
inquiryindicated that students ﬁnd
little time for general reading, and
devote most of their reading to_
books that are, necessary to their
school work. ‘ ' '

ern college woman has not the nec-
essary leisure time for reading be-
cause of her highly specialized
course of study and the competition
of other interests. ‘
W. Don Harrison, dean of men,
stated that men read more for the
intellectual content and women for
thetexture of the material read. He

queiitly include in their reading the
“Saturday Evening Post,” I-Iarold
Bell ,Wright, and “The Literary Di-
gest;” but that after the student had
been at the university for time his
taste changes. , . I
Miss Allison, librarian I.- at State

..hall library, gave her opinion that

students use books that are neces-
sary toI their courses in school. “Eng-
