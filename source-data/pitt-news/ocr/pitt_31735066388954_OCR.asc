UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Reagan and Gorbachev set Moscow summit date

By Terrence Hunt
A!’ White House Correspondent

WASHINGTON — President
Reagan announced Wednesday
he would go to Moscow from
May 29 to June 2 for his fourth
summit meeting with Soviet Iead—
er Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his
first visit to a nation he once
branded an "evil empire.”

The fiveday visit will mark the
first trip to Moscow by an Ameri-
can president since Richard Nix-
on's 1974 summer meeting with
Leonid Brezhnev. Later that same
year, in November, Gerald Ford
met with Brezhnev in the Soviet
port city of Vladivostok.

The summit’s intended center-

piece was the signing of a treaty
to scrap 30 to 50 percent of the
superpowers’ long-range bom-
bers, missiles and sub-
marines. However, Reagan al-
ready has suggested an agree-
ment will not be ready, saying
time is too limited.

Asked Wednesday if a treaty
would be completed, Reagan
said, ”I have no way of answer-
ing that” and added that the two
nations were committed to the
cutback.

Visiting Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze, asked if a
treaty would be ready, replied
through a translator: ’’It is possi-
ble. This is not an easy task. This
is a very complicated task, but we

are becoming convinced that it is
doable.

”There are many difficult ques-
tions of a technical nature, most-
Iy in verification, but in principle
this can be done,” the foreign
minister said as he left the White
House following two hours of
talks and lunch with Reagan.

The summit announcement
capped three days of meetings
between Shevardnadze and
Secretary of State George P.
Shultz. After a morning round of
talks at the State Department,
Shevardnadze went to the White

House.
Within minutes of his arrival,
Shevardnadze and Reagan

stepped from the Oval Office to

the sun—spIashed Rose Garden to
disclose the long-awaited summit
dates.

”We have set the date, and
now we shall take care of good
substance, good content for the
summit,” Shevardnadze said.

White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said the presi-
dent would spend all of his time
in the Soviet capital, following
the pattern set by Gorbachev
when he remained in Washing-
ton during his December summit
with Reagan. However, first lady
Nancy Reagan is planning a day
trip to Leningrad.

Pitt students got a good dose of foreign culture yesterday
at the International Fair, held in Forbes Quad.

Pitt students see
the world at fair

By Greg Keklak

Staff Writer

The University Center for In-
ternational Studies and the
Office of International Services
held their International Fair
yesterday in Forbes Quad. The
object of the fair was to create
an interest among students in
foreign cultures and studying
abroad.

Dr. Angie Yucas, director of
the UCIS Study Abroad Office,
stated that the event was im-
portant because of the large in-
ternational presence here at
Pitt.

”Students don't have a
sense of cultures. [The fair]
presents cultures of diverse
groups and helps students
learn about going abroad,”
Yucas said.

This is the fifth year for the
fair, and according to Yucas,
there is increased interest on
the part of Americanstudents.
Foreign students’ interest in
promoting their cultures has
always been present, she
added.

’’It shows that the interna-
tional dimension is thriving,”
Yucas explained. ”Interest in

the fair is growing and not
about to dwind|e.”

loan Lucas, foreign student
advisor at the Office of Inter-
national Services, was also
very positive about the fair.

”Everyone’s enjoying it,”
Lucas said. She added that part
of the reason she felt the fair
was so enjoyable was the
diversity of entertainment
provided. Included in the en-
tertainment were Indonesian
dancers, Venezuelan drum-
mers, Indian sitar music, Syri-
an drumming and an African
drum ensemble.

The event included tables
set up by various university or-
ganizations and numerous dis-
plays ranging from slide shows
and video presentations to na-
tive clothing.

In general, everybody in-
volved at the various tables
was quite enthusiastic about
the event.

”It’s a beautiful event,” said
Aisha Titilayo of the Pan Afri-
can Association. ”People can
stop and experience other cul-
tures. I’m an American, but I
met other nationalities here 
I wouldn't have experienced

up meetings with Soviet dissi-
dents and refuseniks, as well as
arranging a presidential trip to a
performance by the Bolshoi
ballet.

Asked what the summit would
achieve if an arms agreement is
not sealed, Reagan said, ”There
are a number of other subjects
that we continue to discuss with
each other.”

Reagan, who built his political
career as an ardent anti-
communist, came into office in
1981 saying Kremlin leaders did
not hesitate to lie or cheat to
achieve theirgoals. Toughening
his line, he later called the Soviet
Union ”an evil empire.”

Over 260 Roy Rogers roast
beef sandwiches were devoured
in a matter of minutes in the 1988
Greek Week Gorge, held last
night in the Roy Rogers located
in the Cathedral of Learning.

The rules of Greek Gorge are
simple. It is a team sport, with
three people from each fraterni-
ty and two from each sorority.
The men try to eat four roast beef
sandwiches as fast as possible.
The women must eat only two.
The fraternity and sorority with
the best combined time are the
winners.

The strategies of the par-
ticipants ranged from squashing
and ripping roast beef to soaking
it in water.

ing] started for me when I was
about five years old when me and

University senate addresses plans for future campus

By Scot Ross
Staff Writer

The Senate of the University of
Pittsburgh discussed plans for the
”Campus of the Future” cam-
paign as well as programs for the
advancement of the university at
a meeting held yesterday.

”We have a theme for today.
We call it ’The Future,’ ” opened
Senate President Herbert A.
Chesler.

One of the purposes of the
Senate is to maintain open com-
munication Iines within the
university. ”As president of the
Senate, I am pleased to report that
our system of shared governance
 is working well. Relations be-
tween the faculty and administra-
tion are excellent,” he said.

He explained several initiatives
taken by the Senate since its fall
meeting. Among them are com-
puter access for faculty members,

an outreach program to students,
reviewing the university bylaws
and enhancement of the teaching
functions throughout the
university.

Currently, the Senate is urging
a letter-writing campaign to con-
gressional representatives in
reference to-early retirement lia-
bility tax—exemption.

Another action the Senate is
taking concerns making the state
government aware of the low pri-

ority it is affording higher educa-
tion. This is ”consistent with this
interest in political statement,”
Chesler said.

Senate Vice President Robert J.
Ertel spoke about other recent ac-
tions and activities of the Senate
council and committees.

The new smoking policy was
among the actions he reported
on. As well, he explained sever-
al other programs the Senate has
created. They include a fitness

schedule for faculty members,
improvement of library condi-
tions and discussion on drug test-
ing for university athletes.
University President Wesley
Posvar then reported on activities
within the office of the president.
His comments highlighted
some financial issues centering
on the university, including the

sity and money coming from the

SAPOA, Nicaragua — Negoti-
ators for the Sandinistas and Con-
tra rebels resumed their truce
talks Wednesday after exchang-
ing proposals that, for the first
time, agree on major points. The
proposals, put forth on the sec-
ond day of talks Tuesday, call for
an extended cease-fire, amnesty
and release of political prisoners.
Among obstacles still to be
worked out are how the Contras
will lay down their arms and be
granted amnesty.

The state-run ”Voice of
Nicaragua" today reported a vio-
lation of the truce agreed on dur-
ing the peace talks. The radio said
the Contras ambushed an army
truck Tuesday, killing two soldi-
ers. A Defense Ministry spokes-
man said the ministry had no
information about the report.

The Reagan administration and
House Speaker Jim Wright called

reports of progress at cease-fire
talks in Nicaragua encouraging.
Democratic leaders said agree-
ment there likely would trigger a

Minimum security jail

NEW YORK -— Ivan Boesky is

a Bureau of Prisons official said
Wednesday, one day before the

convicted stock speculator was
required to surrender.

”He’s with the U.S. marshal,”
said Angi Willis, federal inmate
locater at the bureau's offices in
Washington. Willis did not speci-
fy when Boesky was taken into
custody, but other sources said he
was in custody last week.

Boesky, a financier who or-
chestrated one of the biggest in-
sider trading scandals in history,
was sentenced to a three-year
term for securities fraud last De-
cember.

He cooperated extensively
with federal investigators in im-
plicating others in Wall Street
corruption.

U.S. District Judge Morris
Lasker had given Boesky until
Thursday to settle his affairs and
surrender, but Boesky evidently
reported early.

At the request of Boesky’s law-
yers, Lasker recommended that
Boesky do the time at the Lom-
poc prison camp, a minimum
security facility about 150 miles
northwest of Los Angeles.

In accordance with Bureau of
Prisons policy, Willis declined to

confirm Boesky’s prison assign-
ment until after his arrival.

Iran-Contra figures
blast lawsuit of them

WASHINGTON — A nearly
2-year-old lawsuit that accuses
several Iran-Contra figures of col-
laborating with Colombian drug
lords is under attack by the defen-
dants who call the complaint ”le-
gal terrorism.”

The lawsuit, filed in May 1986
several months before the Iran-
Contra affair was exposed public-
ly, named some of the people in
the private network that Lt. Col.
Oliver L. North formed to help
the Nicaraguan Contras.

The lawsuit has attracted
widespread attention, and The
Christic Institute, a liberal policy
group representing the plaintiffs,
has used it as a vehicle to raise
money.

Daniel Sheehan, the Christic
lnstitute’s chief counsel, has
traveled around the country
speaking about the suit, which
was filed by Martha Honey and

The primary reason for the
International Fair is to promote
understanding of different cul—
tures. Erica Sigmon, a senior
here and a member of Stu-
dents Around the World, saw
the event as a way to create in-
terest in study abroad
programs.

”lt’s interesting to see what
other countries are like and to
taste the food,” she said.

People attending the fair
were positive as well. Nancy
Torhee, a senior majoring in
chemistry and a native Nigeri-
an, stated that the fair present-
ed a great opportunity to see
other cultures.

”|t’s great getting to know
what other people are like,”
Torhee said. ’’It should be a
week—long festival. It's not
publicized well enough.”

The overall opinion most
people had of the Internation-
al Fair was best summed up by
Han—yeong Lee of Pitt's histo-
ry department —- ’’In a word,
fantastic.”

review trauma treatments

According to the American
Trauma Society, trauma, the med-
ical term for injury, is the third
leading cause of death among
persons of all ages. Between
140,000 and 160,000 Americans
die from trauma each year. For
youths between the ages of 13
and 34, trauma causes more
deaths than all other causes
combined.

Edward R. Marasco, clinical
program manager of Trauma
Services at Presbyterian-
University Hospital, said, ”The
forum is focusing on the continui-
ty of care — linking all phases of
trauma care from the time the ac-
cident occurs to pre-hospital care,
initial resuscitation, definitive
care on through rehabilitation.
Tying everybody together to
make sure the trauma-care chain
works along lines of the continui-
ty of care.”

Various speakers have been in-
vited to lecture on topics ranging
from the present state of trauma
care to future developments to
how trauma centers are de-
signated.

Several members of the medi-
cal community from around Pitts-
burgh will also be speaking at the
forum. They include Glenn M.
Cannon, director of public safe-
ty of the city of Pittsburgh,
Richard L. Simmons, chairperson
and chief of the Department of
Surgery at Pitt's School of Medi-
cine and Presbyterian—University
Hospital, and Andrew B. Peitz-
man, director of the Trauma Serv-
ices at Presby.

Marasco said, ”We wish to pro-
vide an opportunity for health
care professionals to get together
to discuss strategies for patients of
traumatic injuries, the latest tech-
niques and issues — also to dis-

cuss where trauma care is now
and what kinds of things will be
happening.”

According to Marasco, the ef-
fectiveness of a trauma care sys-
tem depends largely on the
performance of each team mem-
ber. For this reason, the theme of
the forum has been designated
”The Trauma Care Chain.”

Marasco said, ’’If for example
we save a person’s life but the re-
habilitation people mess up and
don't provide adequate physical
therapy, we would be saving his
life but not the quality of his life.”

The forum will be focusing on
several objectives. These include
legislative initiatives affecting the
future of trauma care, pre-hospital
trauma care, hospital resuscita-
tion of trauma patients, children
and motor vehicle accidents, pre-
hospital pediatric trauma care
and issues in pediatric trauma.

A day with a little
for us to believe in

Ah, the glorious days following the vernal equinox. The snow is
heading for parts more brisk, and the sun shines down like water on
the pavement. Spring hits the city, decked out in love and wafting
ambrosia.

For a day, Shiva dances a slow number, and Thomas forgets his
doubts. We just had St. Patrick's day, and no matter what the critics
say, the Irish don't have to worry about snakes. There are a couple
of nasty wars bubbling on Lot's back burner, but owls court in the
magician's elm grove.

New Age is getting popular; our collective unconsciousness de-
mands that we look a bit to the inside. Crystals and seances notwith-
standing, magic is coming back, dragging a little old wisdom. The
harmonics have converged, and the social dissonance of hate almost
sounds like music.

Nothing that hasn't happened before is likely to go down on a day
so gentle. There was food from the other side of the world in Forbes
Quad’s common spaces; the weather was perfect for swallowing a
bit of culture. Cold water hasn't tasted so good since August.

On Monday, the problems will be back en masse, and they will
have lost nothing of their urgency. Yesterday, Gaea was merely point-

#

ing out that there are things worth believing.

In a nutshell 

What with the Los Angeles earthquake, massive forest
fires, beach erosion, freeway shootings and ozone layer-
depletion that's giving every Malibu volleyball player
whole-body melanoma, it looks like God has finally got-
ten serious about destroying California.

Marc Duchin is

Marc Duchin’s article "Living
and dying by the roll of the dice”
made some pretty uninformed
and ridiculous statements. I grant-
ed some leeway in his assump-
tions of what further hypothetical
action would be taken by the
United State since I have come
up with some of the same ideas
myself.

Mr. Duchin’s comparison to
the United States’ policy in Cen-
tral America to a game of Risk
and beer-chugging contests is
way off mark, and the beer refer-
ences in the article are about on
par with what I have come to ex-
pect from The Pitt News. A more
accurate, although infantile com-
parison would be to the game of
Monopoly. The United States has
had its hand in the politics of
Central America for over 80 years
and will probably be there much
longer, unless the number of
U.S.-supported psuedo-fascist re-

LETTERS

gimes that have been falling in-
creases. (Duvalier in Haiti,
Marcos in the Philippines, the
former Shah of Iran and the
Somoza dynasty in to name a
few.)

The day of the U.S. troop
movements, I asked the electri-
cian who was working at my
apartment what he thought of
having an additional 3,500
American troops in Honduras.

’’well, it's all about money;
basically, if you don't play the
game, we sic the army on you.”
Enough said.

Duchin did bring up an in-
teresting point, though. A full-
scale invasion of Honduras by
Nicaragua. The Sandinista
government is having enough
trouble defending itself against

off the mar

the U.S.-supported, trained and
supplied Contra army; how could
it possibly try to dominate its
neighboring country?

Nicaragua was defending her
border against a foreign aggressor
based in Honduras. Marc missed
this point.

Also, he casually shrugged off
any opposition to a quickly rein-
stated draft. I think that Mr. Du-
chin did not do any thinking
about his article at all, since all
you have to do is look around, off
campus, to find more construc-
tive dissent in the community that
existed over 20 years.

I have to agree that most of my
fellow students here are pretty
apathetic though, and I hope that
with a little more practice, The
Pitt News will become a
newspaper devoted to energizing
students, instead of glorifying the
student consumer.

WALKING BY MOONLIGHT

Happy belated vernal equinox.
It's about 75 degrees as I write
this, so on a day like today, it's
very obvious that the sun has in-
deed crossed the equator and
ushered her warmth back to the
Northern Hemisphere -- what
took ye so long?

Since Easter’s almost here,
here's an interesting little fact.
The word ”Easter” comes from
the Anglo-Saxon goddess of the
dawn, ”Eastre.” Her symbols
were the hare, the lily and the
egg. Ever wonder where we got
the Easter Bunny, Easter Lilies or
Easter Eggs? Hmmmm.

The reason that Easter Sunday
changes dates every year harkens
back to the fourth century. Easter
occurs on the first Sunday after
the first full moon after the ver-
nal equinox. So since Sunday
was the vernal equinox, and the
next full moon is April I (Good
Friday), April 3 is Easter. Pretty
neat. The reason for that little sys-
tem is that travelers needed the
light of a full moon to speed them
on their pilgrimages. Easter Sun-
day is also the first day of Day-

light Savings Time. The origin of '

Daylight Savings is boring —— not
even remotely pagan —— so we'll

ignore it.

Last week, I made my monthly
pilgrimage to the Semple Street
laundromat. There's something
magic about that place; exactly
what it is escapes me now.
Perhaps it has something to do
with the day—glo painted
machines and walls. '

Anyhow, I had forgotten my
book and had nothing to do other
than to watch my clothes spin-
ning in the dryer. I turned around
and saw an old man trying to
read the instructions on one of
the washing machines. His face
was about an inch from what he
was trying to read. He was squint-
ing, almost as if he were in pain
and he was sounding out the
words aloud. I saw he had noth-
ing to wash.

Bluntly, he looked like hell.
"Oh, Christ, don't talk to me,” I
thought. Rude thing to think, I

know, but I was just not in the
mood to listen to a street
dere|ict's obvious psychoses.

He walked over to me. I could
see that he had no teeth. He
pulled his knit hat over his ears,
and I tried to look occupied.

"Hey whippersnapper,"
said.

Whippersnapper? Isn't that
what Granny used to say in the
old Warner Brothers cartoons?

"Hey whippersnapper," he
repeated, "have you seen the
news today?"

"About what sir?" I asked, half
expecting to hear another bone-
chilling tale of the beginning of
the apocalypse.

"Our boys marched into Hon-
duras this morning, that idiot in
the White House is at it again.”

I turned and looked at him. I
had heard the reports of the U.S.
presence in Honduras all day. But
this guy looked too far gone to
understand what was happening.

”Yes, I've heard the reports,

he

and I'm none too happy about
the whole situation,” I said.

We went into a discussion on
American foreign policy. This
man was so aware of current pol-
itical events it was amazing. I felt
bad for having cut him so short
earlier.

It turns out that he's a Pitt grad
”from a while back.” After we
had solved all the problems in La-
tin America, we started compar-
ing what it was like to be 22 in
his day, versus what it's like to be
22 in my day.

He said that when he was my
age, there was an innocence, a
naivete. It wasn't necessarily a
bad thing, though. There was
security, but it had its short-
comings.

He said that young people to-
day are so aware, so active, so
cynical. He looked upon it as an
improvement over the old days,
though.

I differed with him on that one
and tried to explain that we're as
naive as this age has always been,
only we know how to hide it. He
wouldn't hear of it, though.

He told me that he tries to keep
up with things as best he can.
”What good is an old mind?” he

said. However, the only thing he
couldn't understand about my
generation, and the generation
before me, is our obsession with
drugs. He asked me to explain it
to him.

"Do you have any experience
with those things?” he asked.

I was quite taken aback. This
guy was at least as old as my
grandmothers, and he was asking
me if I had ever done drugs.

I chickened out and steered the
conversation away from me and
tried to explain that people often
turn to drugs for relaxation, out
of a need for escape, or as a way
to rebel, to show dissapproval
with the system.

It was a great day at the Sem-
ple Street Laundromat. I learned
that things are not always as they
seem, especially in regard to peo-
ple. I've realized that countless

times before, but reminders never .

hurt anyone. I also made a friend.

Tell me not in mournful numbers
Life is but an empty dream

For the soul is dead that slumbers
And things are not as they seem.

food,” said Phi Delta Theta
brother Jerry DiBattista, last year's
champion -and men’s record
holder with a time of 50 seconds.
”Whoever ate the fastest got
more food. It was like a battle.
Then I started entering eating
contests and I haven't lost one
yet.”

This year’s first place winners
were Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity
and Delta Phi Epsilon sorority.
Each recieved $150 added to
their canning totals.

Delta Phi Epsilon was led by a
record—breaking performance by
sophomore Megan Fasy, who ate
her two sandwiches in 33
seconds.

”| smashed [the sandwiches]
up, poured a whole glass of water
on each one, crumpled up the
first one into a ball and shoved it
in my mouth and didn't chew,”
said Fasy. "I just swallowed.”

A large crowd of greeks were
on hand to watch the event.
WDVE disc-jockeys and honorary
Chairpersons Jimmy Roach and
Steve Hansen refereed.

"[The Gorge] went off pretty
well,” said co-chairman Bill Mor-
rison. ”Everything went fairly
smoothly. The place may be pret-
ty trashed now, but it was a real-
ly good time. I think it was a great
success.”

Paramedics were on hand for
the entire event. However, no
serious problems arose.

have not been blind to the needs
of retired faculty,” he said;
however, the general consensus
was that some changes need to
be made.

An update of the ”Campus of l

assistant, J. Fred Gage. They dis-

Continued from page 3

John Frazier, a spokesman
for the PUC, said that the aver-
age customer who uses 460
kilowatt hours a month will
have an increase of $2.92 in
his or her monthly bills.

Ken Shearer, another
spokesman for Duquesne
Light, said the rate increase
would not harm local business
because it will be implement-
ed in installments. Shearer said
Duquesne Light will decide in
a few days whether they will
appeal the PUC ruling to get
their full rate request.

Shearer said the rate in-
crease was needed for Du-
quesne Light to pay for the
operational costs of its two
new nuclear power plants.

Both of these plants became
operational last November. It ,;—-,
is against Pennsylvania state
law for a utility company to
charge its customers for the
construction of a nuclear plant
before it becomes operational.

Many members of city
government were opposed to
the rate increase. The city
commissioned a study thgt
was done by the Wharton
Econometric Forecasting As-
sociates. This study was sub-
mitted too late for the PUC to
consider it as evidence in the

rate hearing. “R

Councilwoman Michelle
Madoff called the rate increase
an example of Duquesne
Light's ”public—be—damned at-
titude.”

Best of the new coalesce for a fest at CMU

By Manny Theiner

Staff Writer

Carnegie Mellon University has
earned a reputation for present-
ing some of the best new music
concerts in Pittsburgh. With the
enthusiasm of ”hip" activities
programmers and the freeform ra-
dio station WRCT, devotees of al-
ternative music have been treated
to such groups as Troublefunk,
Bad Brains, Algebra Suicide and
Of A Mesh over the past three
years.

Clubs and concert promoters
would have tied themselves in
knots trying to push eclectic, yet
fresh musical styles such as Rasta-
core, Gothic, go-go and poetry
rock on an unblinking public.
Yet, mere students at CMU were
able to transform these unknown
factors into successful shows.

Nobody’s resting on his laurels
there, however. An event that in-
volved years of planning will
burst into bloom on April 9,
dwarfing all others in its magni-
tude. Such is the significance of
the Carnegie Mellon New Music

Festival, known informally as
NewFest.

Presented by student—run Quid-
nunc Productions, the festival is
the beginning of an annual event
on campus that will feature in-
novative bands from Pittsburgh
and across the nation.The concert
will take place outdoors with a
rain date set for April 10.

The featured bands this year
satisfy a broad variety of musical
tastes. As long as those who at-
tend are interested in what's new,
there should be no problem suit-
ing everyone’s fancy.

The best known local group
participating is ATS, the foursome
famed for their boisterous brand
of swamp rock. ATS have graced
practically every venue in town
and enjoy frequent play on WPTS
and WRCT.

They will no doubt play many
of their classic hits such as
”Texas” and ”Runaway Barge”
from their cassette called Hail the
Size of Golf Balls, but new
material is expected in conjunc-
tion with the imminent release of
their first 7-inch.

Graffiti’s Tri—State Rock competi-
tion and play an interesting mix
of progressive rock and jangling
guitars. The Shift is a CMU band
sending forth some rocking
rhythm and blues.

However, the real accomplish-
ment in putting together such an
event is the procurement of the
national acts. Something
miraculous was obviously per-
formed, because not one, but
three excellent bands were lined
up.

The first group is Spahn Ranch,
hailing from the U.S. automotive
capital, Detroit. Their new album
Thickly Settledis just that, a col-
lection of dense and raw in-
strumental layerings with a tribal
beat and simple, unsweetened
vocal tones.

For Against occupy the next
spot. No, their name doesn't
mean they can't make up their
minds. What For Against does
represent are waves of shimmer-
ing guitars washing over a moder-

ate dance beat, in the moody
style of Xmal Deutschland and
groups on the 4AD label.

With all.the European stylings,
it comes as a slight surprise that
For Against are from Lincoln,
Neb. Yet the coherent beauty of
their first record, Echelons,
proves that the sophisticated
foreigners can be beaten at their
own game. The music moves the
body as well as the soul.

The crowning glory of the
whole affair belongs to one of the
most important groups in alterna-
tive music today, the legendary
Los Angeles sextet known as
Savage Republic. No American
group is more talented in blend-
ing the influences of East and
West.

While still operating within the
basic setup of a rock band,
Savage Republic have stretched
far beyond the traditional bound-
aries. Two drummers plaster a
frenetic tribal beat fashioned from

oil drums and steel objects onto
droning guitar melodies in a mo-
dal scale, reminiscent of Arabic
folk music.

Sometimes they can, indeed,
get quite ”savage” about it, as on
their angry anthem, ”Real Men,"
one of the many songs from their
double concert album Live Trek
1985-1986, which occupied the
No. 1 spot on WRCT in January.

Savage Republic previously
released two LPs on their own
label, Independent Project, as
well as an album titled Trudge on
Belgium's excellent Play It Again
Sam label. They are currently
working on a new studio LP, so
some brand new material may be
featured.

Everyone is welcome to attend
NewFest, which kicks off at
11:30 a.m. and runs all after-
noon. It will be nothing less than
the rockingest day of the year. Be

.there, or give up all hope of hap-

piness.

Our lovely critic, Lola Fee, has taken another
spring break. She left mumbling something

.7. Io -
  Queen of Sorrows takes the

stage for a dazzling show

By Paul Anater
Staff Writer

Judy Collins. In another era,
she was known as the ”Queen of
Endless Sorrows.” She held court
in the folk music circles of the
_late 1960s and early 705.

On March 19, she came to
Heinz'HaIl through the Pittsburgh
Symphony's Pops series and
treated a capacity crowd to an
evening of memories and a fine
performance.

The first half of the perfor-
mance featured the Symphony's
renditions of ”Hey, Jude,” by
Lennon, the ”QuadriI|e” from
Tailleferre’s Eiffel Tower Couples,
an Irish Tune from County Derry
by Grainger and an excerpt from

Romeo and Juliet by Tchai-
kovsky.

Under the skillful direction of
Michael Lankester, the Sympho-
ny sounded as wonderful as they
usually do, rest assured. Hearing
a 64-piece orchestra perform
”Hey, Jude” made it even more
so. Lankester’s choice of music
set the tone of the evening per-
fectly -- an eclectic mix of new,
old and folk styles that typify the
music favored by Collins.

After a short intermission, the
main event strolled onto stage.
She immediately broke into
”Someday Soon,” one of her ”ol-
dies,” but very definitely a
“goody/’

From there, she sang a mix of
more of her old standbys and a
generous sprinkling of her new-

er music, including a song from
her new album, Trust Your Heart.

Her voice was strong and clear,
and the Symphony compliment-
ed her perfectly. Any fears that an
orchestra would overpower her
were dispelled as soon as she
sang the first line of "Someday
Soon.” She sang for about an
hour and a half, and the audience

loved her enough to warrant two ‘

standing ovations. The only thing
missing from her show .was
”Amazing Grace,” sorry to say.

Trust Your Heart marks Collins’
21st album, proof that folk mu-
sic is still a viable movement.

It's a long way from Max Yaz-
ger’s farm to Heinz Hall, but the
music and sentiments remain es-
sentially unchanged.

Carbon .

Larynx
SST

SST Records, in an attempt to
release open—minded instrumen-
tal music, sometimes releases al-
bums that are seemingly
overindulgent. The new release
by Carbon, Larynx, is one such
album. ‘

This six-song, 40-minute album
has a few good points, but they
are unfortunately outweighed by
the negative ones. The music,
best classified as jazz—industrial
fusion, sometimes takes the worst
examples of both as models.

The first track, only discernible
by the banding on the vinyl, since
all of the songs are untitled, is a

grinding tribal stomp with out- -

time drum fills. Sounds cool in
description, but it goes on too
long to be tasteful. Although the
end is neat enough, it sounds like
space aliens conversing, per-
formed by horns.

Track two is one of the best
tracks on the album. It has a nice
descending synth/clarinet riff
backed by what sounds like
grunts from large, w_ater—dwelling
beasts. it's definitely one of the
most interesting songs on the al-
bum due to its unique tonal qual-
ity. Track three, again, has tribal
drumming but adds ferocious vio-
lins from hell. it's an almost fun
song with a funky, possessed
string quartet playing at the
song's end for a minute.

PART II

Of the other three songs on
side two, the first and the last are
the best. The first song sounds
like it's ”sung” by pigs and small
animals. Fortunately, it has a
tasteful drum rhythm with an at-
tractive muted sax bleating
throughout. The third song is
good in its own twisted way, but
drones on a little long while not

- delivering all that it could. The

worst thing about Larynx is that
most of the songs fail to achieve
a groove that would create a
framework for the musicians to

work around.

The only information available
on Carbon is that it's Elliot
Sharp's band. Sharp has been
known to do innovative things
before and seems to be trying
something here.

But, as with any attempt at do-
ing something innovative, an ar-
tist runs the chance of going
overboard or not being under-
stood. This album of East Village
art music is difficult to appreciate,
much in the same manner that
Sun Ra and Ornette Coleman are.

 No words, but a larynx does not music make

To appreciate Carbon’s Larynx,
one must know a little about the
artist's musical ability and previ-
ous accomplishments. The
known fact that Elliot Sharp
writes out almost every note says
something of the intent involved.

Although I can appreciate Car-
bon’s efforts, I just don't think that
Elliot Sharp has quite pulled off
what he was trying to achieve.
These six songs of hellish des-
cent, clocking in at just under
seven minutes each, are not my
idea of euphoria.

Baseball team ready to turn season around

By Sharon Haney
Staff Writer

The Pitt baseball team opens its

I home season this weekend with

a three—game stand against Vil-
Ianova at Trees Field.

The Panthers, 1-5, will play a
doubleheader at noon Saturday
and a single game Sunday at
noon.

Villanova defeated Pitt, 8-4,
earlier this season in a game
played in Orlando, Fla.

Pitt centerfielder Brian Lohman
went 2 for 4, and catcher Jon
Weaver went 2 for 5. Matt Bian-
co hit a solo home run in the
ninth inning. Senior first baseman

Dave Westvvood also injured his
leg on a slide in this game.

”They are a tough team,” Loh-
man said. ”They’re young and up
and coming. We need to be on
the top of our game.”

The pitching was strong
throughout the Florida trip. Assis-
tant Coach Larry Wayman said,
”The team looked good. The
pitchers seemed more advanced
than we thought they'd be. They
kept us in all of the ball games.”

In the second game in Orlan-
do, Pitt lost to the University of
Detroit 4-3 in 11 innings.

Weaver and shortstop Mike
Claus went 2 for 3, each hitting
two doubles, and rightfielder
Chris Cioffi went 2 for 5. Pitcher

Lane needs more than

rebounds to get off
the bench in the NBA

Pitt forward Jerome Lane has
made a lot of rumblings of late
that he may decide to go hard-
ship after only three years of col-
lege basketball.

.....~...lII.l2ere are a few »reasons that

would seem to make this a wise
choice.

First of all, Lane has had a num-
ber of run—ins with Panther coach
Paul Evans. This causes unneed-

VINCE
CAREY

ed friction on the team, and Lane
could become a disruptive force
that will do nothing but drag the
team down.

Lane has been called the most
dominant rebounder in the na-
tion, and one more year won't
make much difference on that
part of his game.

Then there is Lane's own dis—
appointment. He badly wanted to
win a national championship.
This was the Panthers’ year. They
were supposed to go all the way,
but their loss to Vanderbilt last
Sunday ended that dream.

These are all good and viable
reasons, but they are outweighed
by things that show Lane is not
quite ready.

The problem is that Lane's ship
has not come in yet. He would
only drown if he tested the waters
of the NBA this time around.

Lane did have some great
games this year.

Against Florida he had 21 re-
bounds, and he scored 19 points
and 15 rebounds against St.
John's. In the first Providence
game, he pulled down 17 and
put 17 on the scoreboard.

The numbers are certainly
there. On paper, Lane would
seemingly be able to fit into the
NBA. The problem is that Lane
himself has said that he can't get
up for lesser teams.

Pro coaches, fans and owners
will never stand for this. Just as

in the college game, every NBA
game is important. All the teams
aren't great, but anybody can
beat you.

Let's take a hypothetical situa-

tion. Lane gets drafted by the Lak-

ers. They are so far ahead of
everyone else in the country at
this moment that all NBA teams
could be considered below them.

What's Lane to do now? After
he gets past the first few months,
the games will get boring. If he
decides to slack off at that time,
he will be in the public eye —
which will mean more scrutiny
then he has ever had to deal with
at Pitt.

The only thing Lane will get
into then is more trouble.

Right now, Lane is playing
power forward. In the NBA, he
would have to move to small
forward.

This move will mean that Lane
would have to take more shots.
At this point in his development,
Lane's shot can not be called dan-
gerous. In fact, it is almost laugh-
able because he is so far off for
somebody with so much natural
talent.

Although Lane can be called a
magical rebounder, he can't
make a career on grabbing
boards. He has to be able to take
the outside shot. Without it, he
will be nothing more than halfof
a Charles Barkley.

The draft may not be too kind
to Lane this year. There are a lot
of good seniors coming out — all
of whom will make better pro
players than Lane.

Teams have people like Danny
Manning, Rik Smits, Mark Bryant,
Charles Smith and Rony Seikaly
to choose from. All these players
are further advanced in basketball
and more mature than Lane.

Now, I'm not trying to cut
down Lane in any way. He is a
very good basketball player. One
more year under the tutelage of
Evans, and he could become a
great player.

Anyone can tell that Lane has

Rich Lowman went eight innings,
giving up three runs, eight hits
and striking out four.

”We played as well as I expect-
ed,” Pitt coach Bobby Lewis said.
”Our pitching was a pleasant sur-
prise even though we had some
control problems. I was a little
disappointed in our hitting. We
left too many men on base. But
we have too many good hitters,
so that should improve.”

Pitt played St. Joe's next at the
University of Central Florida. The
Panthers won, 6-3.

Second baseman T.J. O’Leary
went 4 for 4, first baseman Jeff
Hackett and Cioffi both went 2
for 4, with Cioffi getting the
game-winning RBI. Pitcher Steve

Junior Jerome Lane has been ”thinking hard" about the NBA.

only been helped by Evans. In his
freshman year, on the undis-
ciplined team of Dr. Roy Chip-
man, Lane averaged only 5.1
rebounds and 9.1 points. Not ex-
actly star material.

What will Lane do if he gets
into a situation in which a team
is not trying to rebuild and there
are four guys in front of him?

He didn't like sitting during his
Chipman year, and he won't like
it in the pros. In college, he could
complain all he wanted about
playing time. They don't take that
in the NBA. Any se|f—respecting
coach will tell him if he com-
plains he is gone. The team is
there for him; he is not there for
the team.

After one season under Evans,
Lane went up to 13.5 boards and

Hoffman went all nine innings,

giving up three runs (only one

earned) with five strikeouts.
”As a whole, we're getting the

job done defensively,” assistant.

coach Joe Risacher said. ”We
made only four errors in six
games.”

Pitt lost to Central Florida 1-O,
despite Lohman’s going 3 for 4
and Cioffi’s going 2 for 3. Pitch-
er Paul Ponzi went eight innings
and gave up one unearned run
with five strikeouts.

Assistant coach Don Nania
said, ”Our guys are not afraid to
go after the ball. They are a good,
strong group of kids.”

In their next game, Pitt lost to
Iowa State 6-4.

15.8 points. This season, Lane
slacked off a little (12.1 rebounds
and 14.2 points), but that can be
explained by the play of Smith.

Lane may make the excuse that
he and Evans don't get along as
a reason for his leaving.

This isn't a very strong argu-
ment. Many thought Isiah Tho-
mas absolutely hated Bobby
Knight, but they were able to win
a national championship
together.

Even though Lane and Evans
don't get along, the coach still
needs the player. If Lane leaves,
Pitt will be left with no leader-
ship. Brian Shorter can fill his po-
sition, but he can't fill his shoes.
Shorter will need at least one year
under a Lane to reach his
promise. Plus, Lane would have

Weaver and Denny Little hit
home runs. Pitt had some good
efforts out of the bullpen. Duke
Carpenetti gave up only one hit
in one and one-third innings and
Doug Jackson allowed no hits in
one inning.

In the final game, Pitt lost to
Central Florida 3—O.

Claus and O’Leary both went
1 for 3, while Bianco and Hack-
ett went 1 for 4. Pitcher Lowman
went eight innings and gave up
two earned runs with five
strikeouts.

Lowman said, ”We’re way
ahead of what we expected, but
it's such a difference playing en—
closed again. You lose a little
feeling and a little enthusiam.”

Morsholl Clark/The Pitt News

the satisfaction of helping another
player blossom.

Other players more refined
than Lane have passed up their fi-
nal year of eligibility only to fail
in their first year in the NBA.

Take players like Walter Berry,
the Wooden Award winner in
1986. Berry was drafted in the
first round by Portland, relegated
to their bench and eventually
traded to San Antonio. Only now,
two seasons later, is he starting to
become a good player.

The NBA can be cruel to those
who aren't ready. Lane is not
ready for the rigors of the NBA at
this time. Lane needs one more
year to work on his jump shot.
One thing is for certain: Lane
playing in the NBA next year will
be a trip down the wrong road.

‘THANKS  

 

SAMSON

 

“It was a catch '22’ situation. I was graduating and I had the
perfect job lined up. But in all the excitement, I forgot to think about
how I would get to work. I needed a reliable car to get to my job,
yet I needed work to afford a car. And because I was just starting
off, I had no credit history.  

I was pretty depressed, until I heard about SAMSON BUICK.  
They have a program that allows 4 year or graduate degree holders
the opportunity to buy or lease a NEW SAMSON BUICK six months
prior to graduation or up to one year after. My lack of credit history
wasn’t even a problem, all they needed was verifiable employment
commitment.

Thanks to SAMSON BUICK, I’m driving a new car...which, by
the way, I got for a fantastic price.”
