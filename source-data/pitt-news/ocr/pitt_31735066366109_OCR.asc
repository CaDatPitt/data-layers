,_Police Coordinate Security Efforts

Pitt BracesFor Rock Festival

By MIKE MILLER
The One World Festival of

Music, sponsored by the NAACP '

is scheduled for this Saturday
and Sunday in Pitt Stadium, de-
spite attempts of Mayor Peter
F. Flahertyto stop it.

Common Pleas Judge Charles
McCarthy ruled against an in-'
junction by the M-ayor which
attempted to cancel the festival
for lack of housing and security
arrangements.

Greg Ross, a member of the

a promotion staff for the festival,

said that the Mayor acted con-
scientiously in questioning the
security and housing arrange-
ments.

However, he added, “The May-
or brought up questions which
should have been answered be-
fore. We were a lot more pre-
pared than he knew and he gave
us a chance to explain our pre-
parations.”

Residents of the Oakland com-
munity have expressed concern
"over the festival, but according
to. Ross have taken no formal
action to stop it. He added that
festival coordinators met with
the Oakland Development Inc.,
a_ community organization, and
answered questions about secur-
ity preparations.

"The police have made . de-
finite plans,” Ross said. "They
have considered the worst possi-
ble situations and have provided
for them." he said that the com-
munity’s apprehension is the re-
sult of “a communications prob-
lem."

"I feel confident that they
will be satisfied with the pre-
cautions that have been -taken,"
he said.

Superintendent of Campus
Police Joseph Gil explained some
of the security arrangements.

"Starting at 3 a.m. Saturday
morning we will augument our
regular coverage with ten addi-

tional officers and maintain this
until 7 a.m., "Gil said. "At that
time we will increase our addi-
tional coverage to 25 officers
and maintain this until Monday
morning.”

Gil also said that there would
be "a tremendous amount of co-
operation” between. his officers
and the City Police.

He explained that the Oakland

area had been divided into three
police areas.

The first area is the inside of
the stadium. This area will be
patrolled by 160 marshalls pro-
vided by the sponsors of the con-
cert. They can be recognized by
their white T-shirts with the fes-
tival emblem. The marshalls will
be coordinated by two super-
visors, Roland Hayes of the
NAACP Criminal Justice Com-
mittee and Harvey Adams, a
former Pittsburgh Policeman
and member of the executive
board of the NAACP.

The second area consists of all
University property. This sector
will be patrolled by campus po-
licemen who will " insure the
safety and well being of Uni-

GIL: Increasing coverage

versity personnel," according to
‘Gil.

City Policemen will concen-
trate their efforts on the streets
handling parking and traffic
problems. 7

Gil said that the parking prob-
lem caused by the recent strike
may complicate the situation
somewhat.

However, he s51ii,:"l dont

forsee the kind of parking prob—.

lem that you would have if this
were going to be a Steelers vs.
Browns football game. Young
people have various ways of get-
ting around such as wakling,
hitching, bicycling or a large
number in one vehicle, which
older persons would not use.“

Dean Billick, Sports Informa-
tion Director, outlined the pre-
cautions being taken by the ath-
letic department to protect the
stadium Astro Turf from dam-
age by such things as cigarette
burns.

"The field will be covered
with two tarps," Billick explain-
ed,” We talked to the Astro Turf
people and they said that two
tarps should be sufficient. Peo-
ple attending the concert have
also been asked to bring blan-
kets."

Though the stadium is being,

used rent free, the sponsors have
taken out close to three million
dollars in insurance.

The insurance covers acci-
dents, public liability. and pro-
perty damage.

A medical station will be in
operation at Gate 3 of the sta-
dium. This station will handle
transportation to various hospi-
tals in the event of an accident
and care for any drug related
problems. A

Attendence at the festival has
been estimated at between 40.000
and 70,000 people. The NAACP
income from the festival will go
to the local chapter.

Duquesne-Pitt Press Association
Cooperates in News Sharing T

By MICHELLE PILECKI

(DPPA) —- The staffs of the
Pitt News and the Duquesne Uni-
versity Duke have begun an ex-
periment in cooperative colleg-
iate journalism in the Pittsburgh
area.

The Duquesne Pitt Press As-
sociat-ion (DPPA) became effec-
tive August 1, with the signing
of the charter by Duke editor
Jim Hosek and Pitt News editor
Mike Miller. Both editors, or
their appointed representatives.
will act as co-chairmen.

DP.PA will enable the two pub-
lications to cover newsworthy
events on both campuses, such as
student government, PIRG, con-
certs, lectures, etc. Community
events, su-ch as city meetings,
would be covered by one DPPA
reporter for both newspapers.

“DPPA will enable us to ex-
pand coverage” Miller said.

  

, university life.

 

He commented that “DPPA
should go a long way toward
solving the personel problems
that plague both papers.” Hosek
added that “it will save a lot
of work for members of both
staffs, since one representative
will be covering stories for both
schools.”

The idea for DPPA came dur-

- ing this past summer, when three

Duke staff members. including
Hosek, worked on the Pitt News.
The concept of continued co-
operation between the staffs be-
came official with the signing
of the charter.

"DPPA will be invaluable in
bettering relations between Du-
quesne and Pitt” Hosek said. He
explained that DPPA will provide
a forum for the two schools to ex-
change ideas and opinions on

  

If DPPA proves successful,
"it will be a start to get some
type of Pittsburgh inter-collegiate
press association, including all
the area schools,” Hosek said.

At the regular monthly meet-
ings, the two staffs will com-
pare analyses of the newspapers,
and discuss avenues of improve-
ment. DPPA hopes to investigate
matters of concern to students
of both universities, like housing
and commuting problems.

The two sports staffs will also.

be participate in the association.
Duke sports editor Tom Rooney
and Pitt News sports editor Vince
Di Nardo have agreed to exchange
columns dealing with the Dukes‘
and Panthersf basketball, base-
ball and club hockey.

DiNardo remarked that "it
should be interesting to sports
fans of both schools, especially
before the Steel Bowl." .

Representative Selection

Sparks Hot SG . Debate

by,JIM HOSEK

The selection. of student repre-
sentatives to the National Stud-
ent Association (NSA) Conven-
tion provoked heated debate the
July 27 Student Government (SG)
Board meeting. '

The Board "had previously de-
cided to send thnee "Board mem-
bers to the NSA convention to be
held in Washington, D.C. Tom
Bailey, Dave Bluey and Terry
Sadler, according to the ‘ap-
proved’ SG.minutes, were -to_be
representatives. «

SG president Bailey, however,
had made plans contrary to the
minutes, saying, "‘These minutes
are garbage.”

Bluey, quick to react, said,
“You signed these ‘garbage’ min-
utes.”

“Bullshit on the minutes. . .

“ they are not gospel,” retorted

Bailey.

The minutes, according to Blu-
ey, are important in. that the Ad-
ministration receives copies of
them and accepts them as being
factual.

After many proposals concern- .

ing the number of delegates to
go to the NSA conference, a fin-
al notion to send four Board
members and one Legal Aware-
ness Committee member was un-
animously approved.

An emergency request for $300
to fund the two additional dele-
gates was then sent to this.Allo-
cations Committee -for final ap-
proval. The representatives to
however, were
not mentioned.

vRealizing the need for more
order at the Board meetings,
Bailey later said, “We need a.
parliamentarian.”

A. request- to partition Room
306 Schenley Hall to house of-
fices for the Legal Awareness
Committee (LAC), Tenants Un-
ion and Medical Action Society
was‘ then discussed. The lowest
estimate of work to perform the
division of the present confer-
ence room was $4290 after a
numberof cuts in the original
plan.

LAC co-chairman Bob Ging,
said, “The way Student Govern-
ment is expanding, why not do
the job now . . . It’s the sign of
the times. Let’s do it once and do
it well and have it over with.”

“Part of the problem is that we
won't have "it by September if
it’s not done the right way now,”
said Jeff Pasek, LAC chairman.

Also to be included in the par-
titioning would be a conference
room for use by the three groups.
Bailey described this part of the
work to be “too expensive.”

A motion by Board member
Terri Weaver to send all the es-
timates of work to the Alloca-
tions Committee passed, 3-1.
This was made so that the com-
mittee would see that the original
$6000 estimate was "already cut

I by $1800.

The Board then passed budgets

-for American Institute of Aero- '

tion.

nautics ($168), Off-Campus Hous-
ing ($2799), Women's Choral
($550) and WPGH, ($18,528.16).
Budgets for Pitt Ski Club and
the Arnold Air Society were ta-

_bled and will be discussed at

tonight’s meeting.

An additional funding for
Earthright’s Association-Zero Pop-
ulation Growth (EA-ZPG) to print
its publication, Earthrights, for
the students of the University"
only,.was unanimously passed.

The budget for Student Gov-
ernment also passed, except for
the matter of the $7 fee paid by
counselors at Freshman Camp.
It was decided that the latter
would be tabled. .

Earlier in the meeting, Bailey

reported on the progress he had. 

made in getting area banks to
agree to accept accounts of new
Pitt students immediately “with-
out a waiting period.” -Students
will be informed by letter of the
service, which would help them
cash checks over $25. University

,and_ area bank policies prevent

cashing checks over that amount‘
at the present time. ’ ’

Weaver said, “I can see me‘_
students heckling ‘us for getting
the students a service they can do
themselves.” ’

Bill Lenaghan Assistant Dir-
ector of Student Affairs, however, '

defended the program since stu-_. ~
__dents sometimes must wait two

weeks to cash checks over $25

if they are unaware of Univer- A

sity policy. g

“We’re providing a real serv-_
ice to students,” said Bailey.
“Just try to go to a bank mana-
ger and try to gethim to cash

your check, and‘ then see what A

happens. ”

Bailey also suggested that the
Board work to get free days for

students for Election Day in. _

November and an Easter vaca-.'

 

Blood Donors

Needed

On July 4, a mother and :
her four-month’-old daughter
arrived at Children's Hospi-.
tal. The baby was dying. She
lasted only 16 hours before
the hospital record listed the 3
dead child, as “discharged.”
One week later, barel.y after
the funeral had ended, the
mother received a bill
$1037.30. Her insurance cov-
erecl the cost of the funeral,
but no more. Then as if that
were not enough, she receiv-
ed notice that she would '_
have to pay for or replace‘
14 pints of blood. ‘

The legal Awareness Com-
mittee asks your help for
this woman. We don't ask for
money, just that you donate

a pint of blood in. her name.‘ _j 

‘If you can help, please call
the LAC at 683-3133. We'll _
make all the arrangements.
Thanks. , ‘A -

songs are melodic, tastefully ar-

thoughts simply stated.

“Looks as though the life I

for long-time Rush fans and an

Be G/ad You're Not An
Oscar Meyer Wiener

by TOM FLAIIERTY

Chances are we will never again hear that popular advertising

jingle, “I wish I were an Oscar Mayer Wiener.-” Small wonder.

During the opening credits _of Prime Cut, playing at the Chath-'
am Cinema until August 8, the mechanized churns of a meat pack-

,ing assembly fold, spindle, and mutilate a human carcass into a

string of wieners. The meat industry will have to think hard in re- 

establishing the weiner’s favor with Prime Cut audiences.

Unfortunately director Michael Ritchie apparently gave little
thought to his dilemma-the script.

Based on Robert Di1lon’s novel, Kansas City Prime, the plot
follows Nick Devlin (Lee Marvin), a Chicago professional killer, to
the wilds of Kansas City. His objective is to regain the $500,000 that
the Mary Ann Meat Packers have duped from the Mob. Three pre-
vious money collectors have been either wiped out or ground up.

Ritchie presents Devlin and hiscoterie of straight-shooting Irish
assistants as a contemporary Robin Hood and his band of merr
men. .

Their arrival in the Kansas cattle jungle finds them pitted
against the Mary Ann company owner (Gene Hackman), who indul-
ges in drug peddling and female slave auctioneering as a side busi-
ness. '

The script calls for such absurdities as a shoot out at a country
fair (the country_ folk applaud) and an ind_iscreet slave auction, This
isn't to mention the plot deficits concerning Marvin’s past relation-
ship with Hackman’s wife Clarabelle; or that Kansas city is hardly
a Sherwood Forest devoid of any semblance of law and order. - -

Prime Cut through does possess an undisciplined energy which
keeps it moving at a fast clip. This vitality is reflected inthe film’s
fascination with machinery. A huge plow reaper_ that chases Marvin
through a field and which later devours his Cadillac and the crash-
ing of a trailor truck through a greenhouse are smart gimmicks one
might e)_r_pect in a James Bond movie. ‘ - '

Marvin and Hackman give theirusual competent ‘performances
instilling Prime Cut with an added toughness. Newcomer Sissy Spa-
cek, who bears a resemblance to Carrie Snodgrass, is intriguing as at

_ rescued slave, even’ though her role is poorly developed.

This Prime Cut is definitely not ,USDA Grade A. It falls be-
tween balogna and dog meat.
