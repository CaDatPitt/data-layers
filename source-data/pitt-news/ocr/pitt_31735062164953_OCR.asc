Engineering Students Occupy
First New Classroom Building

Formal Dedication‘

Set for Some Time

Later in the Year

The ﬁrst new classroom
building in the University’s
growing physical and educa-
tional program was put into
use when the fall semester
got underway Monday.

Connecting Thaw Hall and
the Old Mellon Institute on O’Hara
St. is the new, seven-story, $1,500,-
000 Engineering Building.

Even though the new build-
ing has not been officially
dedicated, engineering students
“moved in" Monday, said Dean
G. R. Fitterer of the Schools of
Engineering and Mines. Dedica-
tion ceremonies are being plan-
ncd for later in the year.

Enrollment Up

“This new building is a mile-
stone in the development and
growth of the Schools of Engi-
neering and Mines. It is evidence
of the expansion that has become
necessary as a result of the tre-

mendous increase in enrollments

in the Schools over the last few
years. The new building will pro-
vide us with more adequate facil-
ities to train much—needed future
engineers and to conduct vital re-
commented Dean Fit-
terer.

Despite these new facilities,
it was necessary to. establish
strict admissions quotas for the
Schools of Engineering and
Mines this fall to prevent over-
expansion. Even with the ex-
panded facilities. the Schools
were‘ forced to turn away as
many qualiﬁed applicants as it
admitted this fall.

Ground for the Engineering
Building was broken on Dec. 14,
1953. Construction, except for
minor finishing details, was com-
pleted early in the summer. Equip-
ment and furnishings were added

Fallen to Appeal:
Al Field ‘House

For Kickoff Dance

The Uni\'e1'sity social calendar
will get off to an early start Fri-
day night at the ﬁrst annual
“Kickoff Dance" to be held at Me-
morial Field llousc. And although
the Pitt football team will be at
Norman, Okla, in preparation for
the game Saturday, Pittites will
have the chance to cheer the foot-
ballers during the affair.

Art Pallen Due

Disc jockey Art Pallen of ra-
dio station WWSW will help in-
augurate the l955-56 year when
he will appear to spin records.

Sponsored by Sophomore Classes
for the student body, the dance
has as one of its purpose ‘to intro-
duce freshmen on the social
scene.

Frosh Urged to Attend

According to Amy Landy, pres-
ident of the Sophomore Bus. Ad.
class, “We hope that freshmen
will take full advantage of the
opening dance because they‘ll get
to meet classmates in an all-school
social atmosphere. It‘ll be an ex-
citing way to start things off.”

Student tickets are how being
sold for one dollar per couple at
the student desk, ground floor Cl.l

 

since Pitt’s multi-million dollar

will be formally dedicated during the coming year.

$l_.500,‘000—That’s, how much the new Engineering Building cost
the University. The first new class room building to be opened

Powerful Lines Clash 

In Battle of

Unbeaten

By STEVE BUTCHOCK
When John Michelosen’s gridders run out on Cwen Field
in Norman, Oklahoma, Saturday, to engage the powerful
Sooners, they will be up against one of the best collegiate

teams in the nation.

‘And when the opening whistle sounds, the ensuing clash A

between Oklahoma and Pitt should answer the-question of .

just how good the current Pa

nther eleven really is.

In meeting the Bud Wi1kinson¢
aggregation, the Michelosenmen
will be facing one of the soundest
elevens in collegiate circles today.‘

Use Split-T

Wilkinson is a fundamentalist,
perfectionist, and a ﬁrm believer
in the use of the split-T as an
offensive formation.

This can be attested to by the
Sooners’_ winning streak which
now stands at 20 consecutive
games, a scoring skein that
stretches through a national rec-
ord~of 96 straight contests, and
an enviable forward wall that
hasn’t permitted a score on the
ground in the last 35 quarters of
football.

Recognition should_ also be giv-
en tolthe Panther line which has
yet to yield a score via the ground
and has held its two previous op-
ponents to a mere 127 yards rush-
ing. Thus the battle between the
two undefeated elevens could con-

SC Announces

Cash Discounts

Student discount service is just
beginning to get underway again
at Pitt, according to Student Con-
gress ofﬁcers and is now available
to all students. This cut-rate serv-

venture undertaken last spring by
the student governments of the
Pittsburgh colleges — Tech, Mt.
Mercy, PCW, Duquesne, and Pitt.

At the end of last school year
21 merchants had signed contracts,
which do not expire until this
June, to give a 10 percent dis-
count to college students. Over
the summer use o.f the SDS slack-
ed, and merchants have shown
doubts.

Dave Washington, the new
chairman, said his first move in
the discount g-ame would be a
campaign to resell students.

Law Admission
Tests Given to
Schools Soon

The Law School Admission Test
required of applicants for ad-
mission to a number of leading
American law schools, will be
given at more than 100 centers
throughout the United States on
the mornings of Nov. 12, 1955, Feb.
18, Apr. 21, and Aug. 11, 1956.

During 1954/-'55 nearly 10,000 ap-
plicants took this test, and their
scores were sent to over 100 law
schools.

A candidate must make separate
application for admission to each
law school of his choice and should
inquire of each whether it wishes
him to take the Law School Ad-
mission Test and when. Since
many law schools "select their
freshman classes in the spring pre-
ceding their entrance, candidates
for admission to next year’s classes
are advised ordinarily to take
either the November or the Febru-
ary test, if possible.

The Law School Admission Test,
prepared and administered by Ed-
ucational Testing Service, features
objective questions measuring
verbal aptitudes and reasoning
ability rather than acquired in-
formation. It cannot be “crammed”
for. Sample questions and infor-
mation regarding registration’ for
and administration of the test are
given in a Bulletin of Information.
Bulletins and applications for
the test should be obtained four to
six weeks in advance of the de-
sired testing date from Law School
Admission Test, Educational Test-
ing Service, '20 Nassau“ Street,
Princeton, N.J. Completed appli-

ten days before the desired test-
ing date in order to allow ETS
time to complete the necessary
testing arrangements for each
candidate.

being ﬁnanced by the Athletic De-
partment and by members of the
Block P. This innovation at Pitt
has four purposes of operation: to
revive the spirit of big—tirne foot-

core of rooters for the cheerlead-
ers; to provide a visual colorful
spectacle to compliment guests;
and to add to the prestige and
tradition of the University.
Members must arrive at the
Stadium not later than a. half
hour before game time, in order
to get supplies, get seated, and

tomorrow, a table will be set up:

practice the stunts for the game.
Fraternity and sorority groups
which wish to sit together in the
Block P section are requested to
contact Ron Amalong or Sue Bid-
dle, giving them the number of
memberships of the respective
group.
Announce Stunts
Block P Committee has planned‘
tentatively on the following stunts
for the Nebraska game on the

Pit_t Advises ’
New Teachers

Few new teachers accept out-
of—state positions for reasons di-
rectly related to salary, according
to Warren .Shepler, director of
Teachers’ Appointment Bureau at
Pitt. A

The University encourages its
newly trained teachers to work
in the Pittsburgh area for which
its education program is design-
ed. About 85% of students placed
teach in southwestern Pennsylva-
ma.

Forty—ﬁve of the 231 graduates
m 1955 are teaching in.Pittsburgh
"proper, while only fourteen have
accepted jobs in other states.
Those fourteen did so because Qt-
family connections outside this
area.

Teachers who have had several
years experience, however, do seek
higher pay by leaving the state.‘
The average pay for beginning
teachers is $3,130 in Pittsburgh,
while those in other states receive
a starting salary of $3,422.

By Leonard Kirsch
Probably by now most people
are familiar with the “whistle
case” murder of fourteen‘ year
old Emmett Till. Till, while on
vacation in- Mississippi, .SU.-p-
posedly whistled at a, white
woman. He was later kidnapped,
beaten, shot, and thrown into a
river tied to a 150-pound cotton
gin pulley. « 
'.Till’s body was found three
days later. ' A
.Last Friday a jury in Talla-
hatchie County, Mississippi ac-
quitted the two men charged
with Till’s murder. Both men
admitted the kidnapping, but
denied that they had ‘murdered
the boy. ‘I '

When "professor Albert L.

course of the narrative without
embarrasing them.”

Many Profiied

With these words the Indiana
University professor, who had
directed Russell Ferguson’s
graduate study, expressed an
attribute which many graduate
students at the University of

Pittsburgh had already recog-
nized and from which many
more were to prolit in later
years.

For these many students, Dr.

‘in thefcounty. This is what

day for Barcelona.

I had been inquiring about a
bus trip to Barcelona all along
the coast, in vain, and had
resolved myself to taking a train.
But with all those tunnels it
would be hot and dirty by train,
and a bus ride over the Pyrenees
would be so much more romantic!

I marched. up to the waiter and
pointing to the sign queried, “en
autobus?” N e x t I sputtered
“Manana,” switching from my
best French accent to high school
Spanish. The waiter tookthe cue
and said “Habla Vd. espanol?”
“Oui, I mean, si,” I stammered.
But I couldn't.‘ They spoke so
rapidly and I hadn’t used Span-
ish for a year . . . .
A Long Pull ,

In desperation, the men called
the manager of the bus company
and with everyone in,the cafe
‘pulling for me, I started a slow,
‘tedious inquiry. I thought , and
thoughtand ﬁnally came up with,

“Departee par Barcelona manana ‘

en la matin?” “Combien?”

Then ‘with a . little French,
which I’d picked ; up, a little
Spanish which I couldn’t‘ re-
member, a little English which a‘
woman in the cafe tried to re-
call, and a little writing which
proved ineffective," I found out
what time and wherepthe bus

"left, when it arrived and what I '

was to do with my luggage and
passport. '
I remember I ended the inter-.

The verdict of acquittal was
given on the grounds that the

accepts as an un-

r be Emmett Till’s-. The jury came -

to‘ this conclusion in spite of the
fact that no other Negro boy in

Tallahatchie County had been

reported missing—-plus the fact
that Till’s mother had said that,
“Beyond all shadow of a doubt,”
it was her son’s body that had
been found.

Willing ‘lo Believe? , ,
It is hardly‘ conceivable that

‘Till’s mother had wanted to be— '

lieve that the mutilated corpse
found in the Tallahatchie river
was her. son’s.

Even before the decision was
reached, William Faulkner, a
native of Mississippi, said:

“Perhaps we will find outtnow
whether we are to survive or not.
Perhaps the purpose of this story
and tragic error committed ,in
my ‘native Mississippi by two

able way” in which Dr.‘ Ferguson
helped him to identifyproperly
the men and events of his ‘own

_ research. project, and this assist-

ance was always given without
and reﬂection on the student’s
lack-of information naivete.

Unparalleled Career .
Wi'|'li Grads

Dr. Ferguson, who joined the-
Pitt, faculty in 1925, won im-
mediate acclaim from the under-
graduates for his inspiring lec-
tures in American history, and
this success blossomed into the
direction of graduate study in
the decade of the thirties.

After directing his ﬁrst Ph.D.

aspirant in 1940, he moved
rapidly into his unparalleled
career 01' work with graduate

students. Dr. Ferguson super-
vised extensively the writing of
masters theses and doctoral dis-
seration throughout the country.
Befitting his career. The last ten
years before his untimelydeath
on Aug. 20, 1955, at the age of 57,
reprents his greatest accom-
plishment in this ﬁeld.

Sfill Gave Advice
In spite of his appointm nt--gas’

  
   

national conversation confused
but signing, “ls goot.”
Barcelonian Resolution

Well, I did get the bus. and I
got to Barcelona in time for my
summer course at the university.
But I arrived with this ﬁrm con-
viction: Everyone should know

two languages and, if possible,’

even more!
We Americans aren’t in the

same situations as the Europeans. .

Their countries are so close that
it’s a necessity for them to speak
more than one language, But
nevertheless we Americans better

get busy. When I asked European

students what they spoke they"d
rattle off, “English, French. Ger-
man.” When they asked me what
I spoke I said, “Spanish. un
poco.”

Si. Je les parle!

‘While I "was in England I
visited a unique private girls’
school w h e r e nine-year-golds
were studying French. That

wouldn’t be a bad idea for us-

World understanding would be
pushed a step forward if Ameri-
cans were able to say, “I speak
English, French, German.”
Take it from me, you feel much

closer to people when you know.
their language. Secondly, if you,

know their language you begin
to understand their culture. As
another traveller, Shirley Ritz,
said, “People’s faces just beamed
when we tried to speak even one
little word of their language.”

whether or not we deserve to
survive. Because if we in Amer-
ica have reached the point in
our desperate culture when we
must murder children, no matter
for what reason, or what color,
we don’t deserve to survive", and
probably won’t.’’
Deserving of Survival . _
One might go -along all’ the

A way_ with Faulkner if it weren’l: ~

for heroics people’ like Till’s
mother, who prove that we do

“deserve to survive.” This brave v

woman insisted that the body be
sent from Mississippi to Em-
mett’s home in Chicago‘. She kept
the casket opened so thousands
could see what race prejudice
had done to hcrrboy. She made
sure that the funeral services

-were carried by loud speakers to .

over 50,000 people. Alongside

her~~son’s casket she prayed‘:
“Lord, ybu gave your only

Son to remedy a condition. "Let

the death of my son bring _an I‘
_end to lynching!” ' '

’ permanent " head

in February,
1955, Dr. Ferguson continued to
give meticulous individual at-

tention to his graduate students. —

In.thei many hours of these
discussions, he imparted not only
a knowledge of history and its

method, but also much of him-

self. His loyalty to duty, intellec.
tual honesty, and forceful leader-'
ship tempered with sympathy
and understanding were always
present.

The fact that nearly a score of
studentswere in the process of
writing theses or dissertations
under his direction at the time of
his passing‘ is an existing monu--
ment to his success. Perhaps
more than anything else this
emphasizes the loss suffered by’
the University of Pittsburgh and
by those of us interested in the
social studies programs in our
schools of Western Pennsylvania.

Yet, we did enjoy nearly 30
years of his inspiration and
scholarship and can best reflect
it by following the words of ad-

Policy Offers Benefits

More students than ever

before have registered for the

University-sponsored accident and hospital care plan, the
Dean of Men’s otﬁce announced recently.

This year, in cooperation with the Mutual Beneﬁt Health
and Accident Association, the program has been expanded

and broader coverage is available to augment the

Student Health Services.

A Dollar a Month
Premiums are twelve dollars for
twelve months’ coverage. Protec-
tion is granted against those ex-
penses incurred through outside
care up to the aggregate limit of
$1,000 for each injury or $500 for
each illness as described in the
policy. .
Special features of the policy
are: all illness care necessitating
hospital conﬁnement or treat-
ment and the services of a
physician or surgeon during such
confinement is covered; interim
and summer vacation activities,

Here's something.
unique in education.

Near the Pratt & Whitney
Aircraft plant in East Hart-
ford, Conn., a full-fledged
graduate center was estab-
lished this fall by Renssalaer
Polytechnic Institute. Lo-
cated 115- miles from R.P.I.’s
home campus in upper New
York State, the new graduate
facilities will enable working
engineers from Pratt & Whit-
ney Aircraft and other com-
panies in the Hartford area
to continue their studies.
Without interrupting normal
employment, it will be pos-
sible for students to obtain
advanced degrees in special-
ized ﬁelds from the nation’s
oldest engineering college.
Designed to raise the level
of knowledge andto broaden
the base from which ad-
vanced research can be ap-
proached, this entire pro-

Panther Wins
Worry Oklahoma

Sports Editor

‘ Ralph Jelic.

 

/71'

With two fairly impressive wins under their belts, John
Michelosen’s gridders have become the talk of big-time foot-
ball and this Saturday ﬁnds all eyes, focused on their clash
with Oklahoma. _ . _

Fans everywhere are wondering, “Can Pitt win. Are
they that_ good. Is their line that tough.” _

The Panther win over California and their second
half play against Syracuse was good enough.to make
many fans give the Panthers a chance against Bud
Wilkinson’s Sooners. For the ﬁrst time in quite a few
years the fans are getting enthused about Pitt’s chances
of becoming one of the nations top-ranking college teams.

The “betting odds for Saturday’s game will probably
favor the Sooners by about ten to thirteen points. Naturally
Michelosen feels the bookies should tack on at least ‘another
ten points while Wilkinson is probably of the opinion that
the odds are Way out of line the other way. -

Last Saturday in their opener, Oklahoma beat North
Carolina, 13-6. This surprisingly’ close score has led many
observers to feel that maybe the Sooners aren’t so tough
this year. ‘

Thinking alongpthis line, however, is based more on
wishful thinking than anything else. A narrow winning
margin against- the‘Tarheels indicates only one thing’
as far as w_e’re concerned-f—Oklahoma was thinking about
Pitt while playing the Tarheels. Which means they’ll
really be up for the Panthers. ’

Red Grange, with whom we had the pleasure of working ‘II’
with at Syracuse, feels that the Panthers" have a good chance 

of upsetting the Sooners. He said that Oklahoma is wor-
ried about Pitt. Last Week Wilkinson told Grange, “That’s
the toughest game-on our schedule.” I

When asked after the game what he thought about Pitt"s
hesitency to pass against the Orangemen, Grange replied,
“You passed when you needed it and that’s what counts.
You’d have been foolish to show more.” ,

A chat with Michelosen showed that he felt the‘ same
wayabout the passing game. “The boys felt that they could
moge the ball on the ground so we let them go ahead,” he
sai .

All we hope is that if the Panthers get stopped on
the ground this Saturday, they can cut loose some ac-
curate passes. -

A_ further observation Grange 'made concerned the Pitt
blocking. “That blocking from those \fullbacks was what I
liked espec1ally,,"’ he commented. “That’s what makes foot-
ball. And they re what makeyour runners,” he added.

All we could think Was, “Man what blockers you
must.have had.” _ ' ' ;

,Two Starters. Surprise
For Harriers’ Opener

Two surprise starters will be in Coach Carl Olson’s start-
ing lineup Saturday when -the Blue and Gold harriers host
the Geneva Covies on the Schenley Park trail beginning at
1:30 .m.

'II‘3ime trials were held yesterday to determine the best
seven hill and dalers for the tune-up against the Covies.

Emerging from the trials with starting berths were
Perry Jones and Dan Sutter.¢ '
Neither had expected to show as
well as they did, and this sudden
turn has left two Veterans off the
starting sevem

the last several seasons and Coach
Olson has instilled a desire to win
in his boys by emphasizing the all-
important concept of putting forth
100 per cent at all times.

In meeting the Covies, the O1-
sonmen should ﬁnd little opposi-
tion and thus preserve their con-
secutive meet win streak which has
now reached 17.

Geneva and Slippery Rock, the 10-
cals will get down to serious bus-
iness and be at peak form if they
hope to subdue suchstalwarts as
the Quantico Marines, Villanova
Wildcats, and Army & Manhattan
in a tri—meet.
,When the Marines come to the
Oakland trail to challenge the
Blue and Gold, they will have one
of the world’s greatest milers in
Wes Santee. The smooth-striding
Kansas Cowboy and .O1son’s run-
ning tycoon, Sowell, should hook-
up in what is known as a real
donneybrook of a race for faithful
track enthusiasts. .
Despite the presence of Santee
in the service team’s lineup. Ol-
son still believes that the Wild-
cats will present his star-studded

ert, star letter winner of last
year’s undefeated aggregation, ap-
parently just didn’t have the_ steam
and ﬁnished a poor ninth with a
clocking of 24:44 for the scenic
4.2 mile course.

Freas fared slightly better with
a time of 24:20 but it was still not
good enough to earn him a shot
at the visiting Covies.

Jones who ﬁnished sixth and
Sutterwho ﬁnished seventh were
timed in 24:08 and 24:15 respec-
tively.

Another surprise was the ﬁne
running of junior Tom J essup. The
former Langley High School ace
covered the route in a Very good

be another eyebrow-raiser.

Other reliable veterans "who
broke the 23-minute barrier were
Jim Moore, Wendell Harford, and
Thorton Smith with clockings of

Arnie Sowell, apparently coast-
ing, blanketed the winding course
in 24:01’ to. take the ﬁfth spot in
the trials.

Thus with all this desire as
evidenced by the two newcomers
to the starting array, the powerful
Olsonmen should have no trouble
in routing the Covies Saturday and
Slippery Rock four days later.

The casual, easymanner of the
people is seen also in boy-girl
relations. “They don’t usually

casual walks or talks. Couples
don’t hold hands on the street,
either. “The Norwegians never

Zora’s goodbye to Norway was
sad, for she considered it her sec-
ond home and hopes to return
some day. Zora also visited Copen-
hagen, Denmark, where she saw
“Tivoli,” and Odence, Denmark,
where she visited the home of
Hans Christian Andersen. Other
stops on her itinerary were Stock-
holm, Sweden; Darlington, Ripon,
and London, England; Brussels
Belgium; Paris, France; and Gen-
eva, Switzerland. Zora experienc-
ed the samepeaceful, complacent
atmosphere in Geneva as in Nor-
way, and thus was certain the
mountains had something to do
with this feeling.
