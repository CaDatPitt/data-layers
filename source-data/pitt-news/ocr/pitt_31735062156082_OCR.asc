By -CLARK SUTTON

Dwight D. Eisenhower may
come to Pitt for political week,
informed Republican sources re-
vealed today.

These oﬁicials, who asked that
they remain anonymous, said
that “a visit to Pittby Eisenhow-
er has been under consideration
for some weeks.” But only re-
cently has the idea taken “con-
crete form.”

Wants To Meet Youth

The Republican presidential
candidate’s possible i visit has
- been initiated by “the general’s
desire to meet and talk with the

 

young people- of the country,”
according to these sources.

If Eisenhower does come to
Pitt, his arrival will coincide
with the beginning of political
week at Pitt, set to start Oct. 27,
a project. sponsored by the
YMCA to arouse student interest
in politics. , .

Rumored Last Week

Late last week the rumors be-
gan circulating among the stu-
dent politicos backing political
week that both Eisenhower and
Stevenson might come to the Ca-
thedral for talks. But it was only
today that responsibleoﬂicials in

 
 

,aySpeal<Here5oo

both parties would commit them-
selves.

At the present time, Steven-
son’s itinerary would prevent
him from coming to Pitt. Heis
not scheduled to arrive until 6:30

.the night he speaks at Hunt
Armory, and will leave the same
night.

Eisenhower, however, is sched-
uled to arrive Oct. 26 or. 27 for a
“motorized whistle—stop” through
the county before he speaks at

" Hunt Armory, Tuesday, Oct. 28.

Nixon Here Tonight
Senator Richard M. Nixon,

 
 

   

%
Eisenhower’s running mate, is‘

speaking tonight V _
Mosque, and Republican ofﬁcials ‘

pointed out that the Senator is‘ 

speciﬁcally trying to reach the
young people of the country, and
that “Pitt students are more than
welcome.”

.Another political highlight of
the campaign of particular ins“
terest to college students will be
Mayor David L. Lawrence’s ad-
dress tomorrow night before the
Roger Williams Fellowship at the '
First Baptist Church on Belleﬁeld
Ave. Mayor Lawrence will speak
on “Practical Political Action.”

Tax Is Problem

"A i Dean Biddle said that one rea-

son inexpensive tickets had not as
:.yet been made available to stu-
dents was because of a conflict
that would be ‘encountered with
city and federal tax laws. He said
that the student section is con-

2

a taxable. Sale of tickets of any na-
ture to it might alter that|status.

Congress members said that they
had. heard of inexpensive tickets
_being sent to Pennsylvania Col-
lege for Women.
Others Have It
A. Several members noted certain
‘ other colleges where similar pro-
positions to the one suggested here
had worked out efficiently.

Congress president Jack Bur-
Winkle referred the matter to Don
Milletary, student representative
to the Athletic Committee, to take
up the problem with members of

: that group. —

Several members expressed dis-

. . approval of any such system how-
ever, saying that there would be
too much selling of student guest
tickets and that the original pur-
pose of the program would be lost.

Freshman Men Seek
Advice On Fraternities

The eighth ﬂoor Dean of Men’s office is still milling with

anxious freshmen this week. ’

Fraternity rushees are seeing Richard Cunningham, as-
sistant to the dean of men, to select the fraternity they wish

to join. During this week, called¢

“Silence Week,” the fraternities
are not allowed to contact any of
the rushees.

The quiet of Silence Week is a
welcome relief to the harried
rushees and fraternity men, who
have undergone a hectic two weeks
ofrushing. Informal rushing took
place from Sept. 22 to 26, and was
followed by formal rushing Sept.
26 to Oct. 4.

Most of the frat ‘parties tried to
carry out a central idea, such as a
South «Sea Islands theme, or Sail-
-ors”-Dance. One fraternity held a
stag affair at Branch Rickey’s Fox
Chapel home, where baseball no-
tables like Rosey Rosewell and the
Men_ About Town quartet were
present.

By Tiin i(ovor

On page 1 of this paper there '

is a story that says, in affect, .,
that Student Congress is going
to take action on the proposal to
have guest admissions for the
football, games.

The story also says -that "Dean
of Men Theo-
dore, W. Bid-

’ dle “brought ‘

up the - point
that: the tax I
s it uation
might compli-
cate such a
p r o p osal. A
C o ngressman

A mentioned the
~ fact

that inex1:».—.ns. \' _.;.ets
were [being sent ..‘:o_PCW. A
third person put in his two bits
worth by adding that other col-‘
leges had been faced with sim-
ilarsituations and had worked
outkefﬁcient solutions.

You can read all that in the
story _but you may not get the
point; Students are interested in
this. It concerns them, they
should be. But the Dean, also
took part in theidiscussion which A
proves that he is also interested.

There are many students who
are politicians, and some poli-
ticians who are students, but
there is only, as far as I can see,
one campus politician of the cal-

iber of Joe Shuler.‘ Joe is a poli-

Shuler, you see, is an honest;

letic\Committee'. ,

One man cannot hope to suc-
ceed without the "aid and back-
ing of at least a portion, of the
student body and the continued
power of Student Congress be-
hind him. If Congress continues
to take as much interest in the

problem as they seemed to have _

expressed today, then perhaps
the proposal will not die in com-
mittee form as so many of its
predecessors have. "
If the faculty and ‘administra-
tion are genuinely concerned
with seeing that the students get
a fairshake on this deal, Pitt
may justify the fame it has re-
ceived for harmonious and equit-
able» student-faculty relations.

One Guy _With Guts,

‘One student, Jack Beegle,
who brought’ up thepmatter in
Congress, should be commended
for going before the solons and
putting the problem squarely in
their-laps‘. He had enough guts
to shove the ticklish matter into
hands of the people who are sup-
posed to represent the students. _

The project may fail. It may
succeed.»No matter what hap-

pens, the students have a right

Joe says (and any politician
will agree) that the good vote-

essential, he continues, for the

During the oiT—season, Joe de-
veloped his grip by squeezing a
rubber ball. He also has worked
out with such notables as Cyril
Wecht and Ralph Thorne. The
practice has paid off.

Ross Reese, a fellow politician,
says that Joe now has a “greatly
improved, warm, sincere vote-

This newspaper can do its ut-

is in which ring. But Joe, like
others, feels he is in line for
further advancement. He cites
several impressive reasons to
prove this. ‘

Shuler is candid enough to ad-
mit that he is “well qualiﬁed” for
bigger jobs. He knows the polit-
ical ropes, and keeps a close tab
on what is going on around the
campus.

Most people realize that a
prime requisite for the political
hopeful is that -the candidate be
a man of the people. Shuler, as
he himself jokingly points out, is
a man of the people. In the past,
he has worked as a deckhand on-
the river. This summer, ‘when the

tato plant in the Southside. Dur-
ingschol he works part-time as

defects. He is in good shape for

This Fall is Mr. Cantini’s ﬁrst

of Pitt faculty members and students who spent last sum-

“Don’t misunderstand,” added Elizabeth Pickering, one

of two student leaders who re-

Hostess Award—a trip abroad.
“I was glad to come home again,
but there’s so much more I'd
like to see and do in Europe.

Adele Marraccini, who receiv-
ed the other Nationality Room
Award, observed that college
life in Europe is quite -different
from college life here. At Oxford
there are no classes after 12:30
p.m., and _class attendance is
not compulsory.

Adele spent her birthday with
Dr. and Mrs. George B. Fowler,
in Austria. Dr. Fowler,’Fulbright

changes with the times. If art
seems confusing so are the times

The Cantini family proudly
boasts ‘of not only Virgil in the
artistic world, but also of two
other brothers who are engag-
ed in the same profession. And
they come by it quite natural-
ly, for they have all followed
in their father's footsteps.

An even though Mr. Cantini is.

interests, unlike so many profes-

this one vein. He is an avid
sports fan and recalls his days

where he earned his bachelors

His greatest appreciation £011-
cerning his new position at the
University is that he has been
given so much more freedom
here. And if past experience is
any criterion, he’ll probably de-
vote this new time to some new

them, in the form of continued
ﬁne running on the part of Billy
Reynolds and Bobby Epps, and the
success of power plays inboth
previous encounters. In fact, ob-
servers from Norman remarked
that Pitt showed . one of the
“speediest”. backﬁelds in the
Southwest. '

Lattner Irish Star
The South Bend backﬁeld has

' its brand of speed and power, too,

in the persons of Halfback Johnny
Lattner and Fullback Neil Wor-
den. Stadium fans mayremember
Worden’s utter disregard for the
Pitt defense in last year’s 33-0
thumping. Lattner is fast devel-
oping into the star of the team
with his running, kicking, and de-
fensive ‘play. A -

ﬁght School Spirit
With Cop Clubs

By BORIS ‘WEINSTEIN
Sports Editor

 

 

What is this thing called school spirit? Do‘ you gauge
it by attendanceor actions? There a few people around this
campus that aren’t exactly sure now after the post-Iowa
game excitement. ’

One group, the. Stadium cops, must have thought the
students charging toward the goal post near the Gate 3 en-
trance were rioting because they greeted the throng with
brain—beaters. Or did they club ‘ — ' ~- "
a few fans just for exercise? ‘ '

At any rate, all the over-en-
thused, win-happy kids Wanted
was a piece of wood. You know,
like a piece of birthday cake.

Apparently, the “school
spirit” that university oﬁi—
cials desire, should be ex-
hibited by the student body
with more sophistication—— Hamilton Gm-ber
maybe a good old fashioned rah, rah,‘ team, knock ’em dead
cheer. Sure, that sounds sophisticated, like a hole in the head.‘

Then again, maybe aupacked stadium would reflect a spark of

   

-school spirit.- Those shining faces with green dollar signs would

make anyone’s.spirit erupt.

Actually, the goal post incident would have gone unnoticed ex- .

cept that Athletic Director Tom Hamilton was indirectly responsible.
Before the season started the Captain lectured Jay Garber, the
human Panther, on the subject of “HoW to stimulate school spirit.”
“We have to get spirit,” Hamilton sounded. “I don’t care
how," any way you can.” So Jay, decked out in his costume went.
into action after the Iowa victory.

He cleared the band from its position against the stands and
led the charge to schoolspirit.
‘ ' Half way up the post reaching for the crossbar, the cops yanked
at his tail and hauled him down. Here he was, trying to carry out
the Captain’s orders to stimulate spirit and found himself ﬂoored.

Those cops must have thought he was a crazy cat.

Harriers Sweep Initial Meets

  

By DAVE MAZER

After romping over West-
minster and Geneva without
much effort, Carl Olson’s har-
riers will face their ﬁrst major
test this season when they engage
Ohio State Saturday at Schenléy
Park. '

“Ohio State,” according to Olson,
“considers cross country a _major
sport and annually comes up with
a strong team.” 0

However, the Blue-and-Gold
runners scored identical 15-48
wins over Westminster and Geneva
last weekend and showed that
they’ll be ready for the Buckeye
invasion.

6 Luterancik 'I‘op'Man

Captain Bernie Luterancik of
Mt. Lebanon led the harriers in

both meets_, coming home_in 23:08
against Westminster for the fastest

time recorded this year, and
23228.2 in the slower Geneva
match.

.Tying_ at 23:26 for second-place
honors Friday were Dick 'Weber

Gatti of Connellsville.

Weber ‘also ﬁnished together
with Luterancik for ﬁrst place
Saturday while Delli Gatti came
in third‘.

Team Looks Good

Dan Sommer and Ron Sallade
rounded out the ﬁrst ﬁve in both
meets while‘ Dick Bloom of West-
minster and George Jackson of
Geneva placed sixth in their races.

Don Doyle and Chick Wivel each
garnered a seventh to complete the
home team’s sweep.

Former cross-country star Ken
Mahanna vsih 0 attended th e
matches commented that “the
team looks good and with the close
grouping between the ﬁrst few
men, the squad should be pretty
hard to beat later in the season
