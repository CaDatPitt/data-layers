Criticism Of ‘News’

Evaluated at Meeting

Marty Landy Assumes Position
On Student Publications Board
‘It is the student body not the administration that should

police the judgment of the student newspaper, commented‘

Dean of Liberal Arts Albert B. Martin in review of recent
Studen«t'GoVernment criticism of The Pitt News.

Dr. Martin, speaking as a member of the Student Publi-
cations Board inpa Board meeting last Thursday, stated that

he would be opposed to any ad—¢
ministrative pressures placed
upon any student publication.

These comments ‘grew out of a
discussion in which Martin Landy,
Student Government president
and newly. appointed member of
the‘ Board, Student Government
president and newly appointed
member of the Board’, explained
SG’s position regarding its recent
attack upon The Pitt News.

Landy Explains

Landy explained that SG will
keep the heat on but in no way to
threaten the autonomy of the
paper or put any sort of pressure
on it called censorship. Anything
they do, he concluded, will be in
keeping’ with their obligation to
have a responsible and free press.

Andrew Chancellor, city edi-
tor of the ‘Post-Gazette and
member of the Board, expressed
the hope that SG would con-
tinue to keep this heat on. He
-called it a healthy situation
when a staff is ready and will-
ing to acknowledge an error
and when they can print a full-
and swift reaction.

The University is very lucky to
have this sort of controversy
going on. ‘

Chancellor added that everyone

Midday Poet Writes to Disturb

By NANCY DELANEY

His own epithet, “The fool-
ish, maybe chosen beast” was
even more beﬁitting Wednes-
day’s Midday Series lecturer,
Jack Gilbert, than “The Hot-

test Unknown Poet in Amer-i

ica”—billing the Midday Commit-
tee gave him. _

“Unknown,” he p r o b a b 1 y
shouldn't be; “chosen” he proba-
bly is. -

Not a Good Joe

Chosen to disturb. “‘A poet is
not a good—Joe,” ‘he contended.
Poetry and education are both a
disturbance of the peace. It must
destroy what you are now in order
that you become what-you can be.

He is tired of “mild poems
about nothing,” meant merely to
entertain. You should be forced
to approach a poem like Cyméle
gazing on Zeus: “.You can’t look
on that magniﬁcence without
being destroyed, even if you are
expanded.”

True poetry, according to Gil-
bert, is frighteningly dangerous.
It demands ﬁerce participation,

‘I In The Spotlight

With Stan Schweiger

The University Theatre—Pitt Players’ production of
“Iphigenia in Aulis” by Euripides will be presented November
8-12 in Stephen Foster Memorial __Hall. So much for plugs.

The basic foundation of

this column involves the im-

'portance and necessity of college theatre groups, acting
‘schools, and various community theatrical organizations. It

is their relation to the world of the?

theatre and to the growing im-
portance of theatre in our society

that these groups have gained such
great stature in recent years. The
training ground of Herman Mel-
ville was the sea; that of Samuel
Clemens, the steamboats of the
Mississippi and the emerging
western frontier. These great lit-
erary talents found new experi-
ence and meaning as they traveled
and communicated with many
people in varied environments.
Today the aspiring actor, actress,
“playwright and director are gain-
ing a training ground by partici-
pating in the activities offered

‘them by the colleges and com-

munities, The budding talents
have discovered the means to gain
their education in the theatre and

‘ today in our country

-I-raingn there are . over one
.. g t h o u s a n d collegi-
Ground ate groups and the

wonderful total of
four thousand similar groups in
the nation’s larger cities, bor-
ougs, towns, villages, etc. What
is shown from these totals is’ the

~ fact that the knowledge of the

theatre, music, the dance, and the
like has mushroomed into a sort
of cultural boom that has taken
the country by storm.

‘The old image of the actor
(starving, needing a shave and
haircut, non-conforming, brood-
ing) has been put aside and a new
one of dedication and interest has
appeared in its place. This may
be only a passing fancy on the
part of the American public, but
while it lasts everyone is taking
advantage .of the new boom. The
bankers, doctors, teachers, and
housewives of America are form-
ing theatrical groups at a faster
rate than a 'Kelso stretch drive.
All seem intent in bringing to their
community the glamour, the ex-
citement, and the meaning con-

. nected with the theater and all its

aspects. Everyone pitches in and
theatrical sets, scenery, and design
become reality. The subject mat-
ter of the presentations varies and
I have seen “The Glass Menag-
erie,” “Damn Yankees,” and “Born
Yesterday” done in succession-by
a New Jersey group. Quite a vari-
ation and one -that shows a great
desire to gain experience in all the
forms of the theatre and at the
same time to bring knowledge and
entertainment to the local gentry.

With university groups, the re-
sults have been even -more re-
mark-able. These groups are deal-

ing. with intelligent and. ‘somewhat
mature theatre-goers and they are
gaining a- great education and ex-
perience by presenting works that
offer challenges to the actor as
well as to the viewer. In resemb-
ling a reporatory company to .a
great extent colleges have not
found it too difficult to present
the most varied of works, thereby
acquiring experience in many
modes of the drama and learning
those, techniques associated with
acting style and individuality. At
the University I have been fortu-
nate to see such presentations /as
“Becket,” “All the King’s Men,”
“The Bald _Soprano,” “The Sand-
box,” “The Death
of Bessie Smith,”
“The Boyfriend,”
and “The Mikado,”
among other things.
Music, avant-garde drama, his-
torical drama, the modern drama,
.and now with “Iphigenia in
Aulis,” the classical Greek trag-
edy. There is no limit to the di-
versiﬁcation in technique and
style of the theater since its in-
ception during ancient Greek
times». These are the challenges
that are offered to all the aspirants
and to the audiences...An educa-
tion of this sort is of unquestion-
able wealth for all concerned.

We can be quite overjoyed with
the fact that the growth of interest
in the world of the theatre is add-
ing a new dimension to our so-
ciety. Students are being educated
in the art of the theatre with an
eye towards their future ‘in the
“business.” Others are -involved
with similar projects through, de-
votion to their community and be-
cause they get a certain satisfac-
tion from their endeavors. It "is
gratifying to watch this culture
boom occurring all over, the na-
tion and to know that our future
and actresses have the- chance to
learn and experience the assorted
facets‘ involved in this vocation.
At the same -time is shown a com-
mon cultural and educational tie
with the community and the the-
atre that transcends "the usual
drabnesis of life that so_many, peo-
ple complain about. A well de-
served round_of applause for uni-
versity theatricals and community
workshops. .

Pitt Players Hear Talk by Billy Foster

By DEVRA LEE DAVIS

Strippers aren’t that important.
Or so says Billy Foster a bur-
lesque comedian for 50 years,
who told the Pitt Players “back
in those days we didn’t need
them, we had talent!”

Foster began his career by
jokes from anybody.
“Any line good for a 5,000 dol-
lar pact was good enough for a
ﬁve dollar-a—nighter like me.”
He literally traveled the vaude-
_ville circit. In fact, he “walked
from town to town.”

In the twenties Foster teamed
with Harcord and headlined the

' Columbia circuit —- the Metro-

politan of burlesque. Foster remi-
nisced “circuit was big enough to
keep a performer busy for. ﬁve
years without changing his act.”
Main Complaint
Foster’s main complaint with
present day burlesque is that the
no-talent strippers h ave taken
over. “I was in it when it was
good: the comedian was the show,
then, . . . now it is just dames.”
Dr. Ralph G. Allen, assistant
professor of speech, told the
Pitt Players that “the burlesque
of Billy’s time was the actual
folk theatre of the day. When
the strippers began to take top
billing, Billy had to learn dirty
jokes to get into the business.”
It wasn't until striptease began,
that vulgarity entered burlesque.
Foster recalled several of his
old cronies some of whom are still
active comedians. “Lou Costello
was one of our best little drunks;
and the fat one, (Jackie) Glea-
son, was too. Red Skelton was
never a full—fledged comedian till
he found he could make a lot of

. money.

Red Was There
“Skelton was there, all right,
but he had brains enough to get
out of it.” '

Oldest Burlesque Comedian. Feels
‘Strippers Not That Important’

 

 

BILL KINGSLEY and Dr. Ralph
Allen listen attentively as Billy

Foster vividly described the old
burlesque circuit. “We had trained
dancers — mediums, poines, and
showgirls. At least three straight-
men use to feed the lines to me
. . . they have juveniles nowadays
too . . . they call them singers.”

“Five people get out of a taxi
and say here’s your show today.
Back then things were differ-
ent.” ’

‘ Radio Talk

After a discussion between Fos-
ter and Dr. Allen, which will be
heard on WPGH, the Pitt Players
asked Foster about tricks of the
trade. He deﬁned timing succinct-
ly: “your laughs are coming ain’t
they, that’s timing.”

Stage fright is nothing new to
Foster. “I still get worried . . .
you got to get nervous or you

don’t constitute a good person

in my opinion.”

Foster reminisces over the old
days of burlesque.

Foster offered much advice to
his theatre-oriented audience, as
well as provided them with a
personal history of a comedian.
“A comedian never starts being
a comedian till he gets all his
bumps . . . I’ll tell all.of you to

know you know then go on . . .

A sh al Is godfor yu. u hen y rell

Foster disclosed his ﬁrst en-
counter with striptease." The
manager asked him to forego
his normal concluding scene and
put two dames in his place.
When the manager told him
“not to go away” Foster replied,
“Oh, we won’t go away. We’ll
get the first seat in the paddy
wagon.”

Foster knew then that bur-
lesque comedy was on its way out.
That night he “fouled the dames
dances and pulled those
strings” and caused havoc.

Foster’s appearance was spon-
sored by the Pitt Players and
moderated by Dr. Allen. With the
aid of a Charles Merill Founda-
tion Grant, Dr. Allen is compil-
ing a non-literary history of
American drama. “If somebody
doesn’t put the burlesque scenes
in a library, they will be lost,
since ‘burlesque was not a writ-
ten art,” he said.

Editorial: In Defense  

 

wlfiglitful   Pride‘

“Evil,” “biased,” “inaccurate,” anti—Greek,” “anti—administration,”——-
these are ugly words, but they have, in certain quarters become synon-
ymous with “The.Pitt News” in recent weeks. The verbal barrage has

i . been, to say the least, full and, like a Playboy foldout, has left little to

the imagination. We have been accused of being unfair and prejudiced,

reporting, and traiterous to the community we serve.
The Pitt News is a proud organization, as any should be of itself,

‘derelict in_our duties as a newspaper, purposefully malicious in our

but we have been forced‘ to face these accusations, by virtue of their

numberand seriousness, with objectively and with an equal degree of

gravity.

The word “evil” we dismiss unequivocably. It was, we believe an ‘
unsuccessful attempt by its speaker to ﬁnd a word’ strong enough to re-
lieve a certain angry frustration. ‘It was meaningless. Biased? If we are

biased we would certainly like to know where. We have been trying an

experiment in interpretive reporting, admittedly. The New York Times,

The'Ch7-istian Science Monitor and the Washington Post write interpre-
tatively. Also admittedly, many of our reporters are -inexperienced, but_

‘if they are going to write, they_need practice. They write what they see.
There is no editorial pressure placed upon any member of our staff to
followna particular policy. Each reporter ‘writes as anjindividual; If a
writer ﬁnds that a fraternity smoker is boring and “like any other fra-
ternity smoker at the University in the past two years,” and can back
that sentiment with a random sampling of quotationssfrom the persons
involved, then there.-_is no reason why that reporter cannot report his
ﬁnding. This is not a question of black and white. It is a matter of shades
of journalistic theory. Our feeling is that a reporter must maintain a cer-
tain aloofness as an observer, but'must become personally involved to the V
extent that he can write a human, colorful story. Personalinvolvement
means the formation of opinion. We will continue to strive for that hu-
man quality with which, ideally, the reader as well as the writer can ‘

identify.

Accuracy. This, we confess, has been a sore spot. It is, however, a
sore spot with any newspaper because it is by far, the most difficult ele-
.. ment to control. The editor cannot possibly run down each fact in each

story. He must rely almost exclusively upon his own limited knowledge,

and the reporter’s say-so. And the reporter must rely upon the news
‘releases which he receives. It often happens, as some of those ._who have

castigated us for previous errors will admit, that the releases’ themselves
contain errors, or that an inexperienced reporter’ will confuse the facts.

1' It even‘ happens that an editor will sometimes make’ an error _which

would not have been made if he had been more careful. But we will

. deny vigorously and condemn as irrational~any accusations that The

Pitt News is deliberat_ely inaccurate or that we purposefully _bypass op-
portunities- to check doubtful facts. We have had, in reality, very few
errors. Those that we have had, however, have been blown tremendously

out of proportion to their importance.
‘All that has gone before has been more

in the realm of the abstract

than the empiric." The limitations of The Pitt News can be measured in
numbers — the number of reporters as compared tothe number of Uni-
versity events to‘ be covered, the numberof column inches of text as
dictated by the number of inches of advertising. Perhaps, then, the effi-
ciency with which The News has served, its purpose‘ as regards the Uni-
versity community can also be measured in nunmbers, or at least out-
liner. But what is the purpose of the. Pitt News? i

We envision ourselves as a sounding board for the entire

University

community, a community made up of some 16,000 graduate, undergrad-
uate and professional students, and 2,000 to 3,000 faculty members. Qur

Editor, The Pitt News:

To begin with, I wish to
have it clearly understood that
I am not condeniing any per-
son or organization in this let-

ter. I only wish to bring to‘

their attention the fact that
‘they are interfering with the
rights of others. I hope that
they will be able to see my
point and understand it.

‘It appears to me that non-
fraternity students are having

' their rights as students of the

University infringed" upon by
some of those who are mem-
bers of fraternities. This was
brought to my attention at the
California-Pitt I football game.
Upon’ arriving at the sta-
dium, I was amazed and some-
what disgusted to ﬁnd that a
very large portion of the stu-
dent section had bees roped
off by various fraternities in

~order to reserve seats for

themselves and their friends.
There were almost two com-

purpose is to report and evaluate,lnot chronicle or describe, events which
involve the University either directly or tangentially. We present the

varied opinions of our readers, and we present our own opinion. This is

our duty. Now let’s talk numbers.

We shall limit the survey to the first issues of The Pitt News in the '

Fall trimester, 1963, since it has been within the term of this editorial
board that all complaints seem to have been generated. _.

As this editorial is being written, the twentieth issue of The News is
being put to bed.

For the ﬁrst nineteen issues, The Pitt N ews-editorial staff consisted

of 14 reporters and editors, not including a regular sports staff of six.

In those 19 issues we have printed 178 -pages plus a 16-page Regional
Campus supplement. The number of pages is decided by a constant
formuladetermined by the business staff according’ to advertising inches.
In those 19 issues are included two pre—hom'e ‘game football issues.
VWithin the University community there are approximately 970 sepa-
rate areas of activity,Vfrom a ‘conceivable 200 of which emanate something
newsworthy every week. The proportion of space and manpower, there-
fore, to printable activity is small. I V

In theﬁrst 19 issues, however, The -Pitt News has been able to cover

.35 separate underigraduat_e student organizations in‘ addition to 18 separate
items in the ﬁrst 19 issues, of which varsity football was covered in 112,
Student Union activity in 53, Student Government "in 47, and Interfrater-
nity Council in 29 (not including Pan-hellenic Council).

Those are the bare facts. Being primarily undergraduate oriented,
The Pitt News has been able to cover every undergraduate activity and
organization, plus an added 91 University departments-. V

To carry statistics just a little farther, we have been accused of
being“anti-fraternity” and “anti-administration.” Out of the'13 editorials
printed in'thé ﬁrst 19 issues, four have taken exception with University
administrative policy, two have agreed with administration policy, and
one has been an objective evaluation of the fraternity system. Of the 33

. editoriallcolumns, three have taken exception with administrative policy,
and-two have.defended the fraternity system. There have been no “anti- ,

fraternity” columns. 

,, . It would take more than that to convince us that we have been “anti-._ V --
fraternity or administration.” Three of our editors and_ several reporters _
are G/reeks, and our constant advertisements for reporters and proof-.

readers" seems a fair indicatiorrthat we are far from being an unreach-
able “ivory tower.” . . , j —

One more.a_re‘a is" what we call special student services. It includes»
the pre-home. game free ‘football line—up, the special .16—page Regional

Campus supplement, _ and last iFriday’s special ‘campaign editor for
. Amendment 1_-A, which was printed 30,000 ‘in number, distributed .at the

football game and sent .to the parentsof -all students living in Pennsyl-

vania. V -
VWhat these ﬁgures show is ‘perhaps for our readers to decide. What

they indicate’ to us, however, is a conscious attempt to represent in print’

the activities and opinions of the University community. We have tried
to appeal to all tastes through our theater columns, book reviews, sym-
phony ‘reviews and jazz columns. ‘We have printed all opinions, as in-
dicated-by the fact that 15 of 17 lettersto the editorwe have printed
have directly criticized our own writers. When we have madean error,

our retraction has been swift. And we have devoted the greatest part of

our energies to the student. V i V — , . V .
We are,”again, a proud organization. We feel we have reason to ‘be.

Hence poets should be tyrants,

A m o n g Gilbert’s favorite
symbols are whales and ele-
phants--pbeasts of magnitude.
The unimportant things in life,
which Gilbert enumerated at the
3 p.m. coffee .~h0ur, include.
grades, prestige, money, and
clothes. You may ﬂunk out
of ‘school if you’re really inter-
ested in education.

Once you have education at all,
he added, you’ve got to keep on_

-heading _ toward magnitude, or’

you’ll never be happy. You’re no
longer innocent. It’s too late.

_ You’ve' got to have guts—but -
you’ve also got to have a mind.

Courage Everyday
“The Abnormal is not Cour-
age,” “however, he revealed ' in
verse, but rather courage is in the

everyday action, “steady and clear

-——then crescendo.” ‘

The Beats, for instance, are not’

courageous. They are not only for
kicks, and ‘fkicks” is not life.
Primitivism rips off ever larger
chunks of raw ‘material, each time
diminishing the appetite for the
next chunk, each time striving

for bigger, better kicks. Civiliza- -

tion, on the other. hand, makes
Inore andmore available. It is
only the pressure of discrimination
that -gives you the most out of art

al’ Affairs. He worked for years
with Latin Americans. in the Pan
American Union in Washington,
D.C.

In his work, Eisenhower found
that the Latins try to be individ-
ualists, not at all like the public
conceptionthat holds them to be
siesta—minded or manana—minded.

“Peoples of all classes in Latin
America have an intelligence
that is challenging, a vitality
and personality that command
affection, and a potentiality that ’
is unexcelled,” said Eisenhower
in his book. His writing is based
on the assumption that revolu-
tion is inevitable in, South‘
America and points out that the.
West must act now to determine
if the revolution will be peace-
ful and democratic or violent
and communistic. .,

When he started his study,
Eisenhower found that the voice
of revolution was lmuted, that the
Latin people ‘simply. wanted a
massive Marshall Plan for" Latin
America. ' 1

“But the mood has changed,”
he says, “the people realize that
the futility of their lives is the
result of an evil system of injus-
tice.” He ﬁnds the Latins to be
“furious” to change the future.

The Panther dressing room had com-
-pletely emptied out Saturday except for a
small knot of alumni gathered around
Fred Mazurek. Thoughall the players had
showered and gone, Mazurek was still
smeared with mud.

Everyone wanted to talk to him, es-_
pecially the alumni.
He made their big
day — Homecoming
— a memorable one.

“Jock would have

the stuff you pulled today,” Kish laughed.
Mazurek laughed too. Many players would
have been bored. Maybe Mazurek was too,
V but he didn’t show it.
He merely listened intently, not saying
much. He had said quite a bit earlier,
mostly praising his teammates ﬁne play
and belittling his own efforts. , .
_ “This wasn’t my best game,” Mazurek
said, “but it was for the team. A lot of
people got down on us after we lost to
Navy, and there were a lot of nasty things
said,‘but today we showed everyone what
a great team we have. '
“I never saw a Pitt team so ﬁred up,”
Mazurek continued. “Once J elf Ware came

That really ﬁred us up. We ‘could have ran

Syracuse coach Ben Schwartzwalder
said, “Pitt won the game by handling our
tackles in the second half.” Mazurek was
nowhere nearly as speciﬁc.

Mazurek said, “Man, we- not only
handled "their tackles, we handled their
ends, guards, centers and anyone else that
got in the road.” ‘ '

Mazurek was in prime physical condi-"

tion for Saturday’s game. “My leg was
okay today,” he said. “It bothered me quite
a bit against Navy, but, you know, I didn’t
want to say anythi_ng.” ‘

ing the Panthers to the 35-27 win. His three
backﬁeld teammates picked up only 65
yards along the’ ground during the after-
noon. ' V

The importance of Mazurek’s contribu-
tion to the Panther attack is emphasized by
his efforts on the touchdown drives. On
the Panthers ﬁrst score they moved 81
yards. Mazurek was directly responsible
for 73 of them, 35 on the ground and 38
in the air. A I .

Mazurek‘ gained all but one yard on
Pitt’s second touchdown drive passing for
16 and running for 41. On the Panthers’
"third tally, an 85_yard drive, Mazurek ran
for nine yards and passed for 9.45. On the
fourth and decisive Panther score Mazurek
contributed.47 of the 62 yards- '

As the saying goes, “Freddy was ready.”
He was responsible for one of the ﬁnest
oﬁensive performances and most exciting
games seen at the Stadium in recent years.

Orangemen, 35-27

By AL BLUMKIN

“It was the best football we've played all year,”,said
coach John, Michelosen. “They made a great comeback.”

Michelosen was referring to

the Panthers’ second_ half

play in the 35-27 victory over Syracuse Saturday at the

Stadium.

V Led by the passing and rushing of Fred Mazurek, the
Panthers rallied from a two touchdown deﬁcit, outscoring
the Orange 27-7 in the second half. The victory over Syracuse re-

kindled hopes for‘ a post-season b
their record to 5-1.

owl bid as the Panthers upped

Mazurek shook off his personal disappointment of his per-
formance against Nav‘y by piling up 255 yards in total offense. He

raced for 119 yards in 22 carries

and completed 13 of 21 passes

for_136 yards. He ran for two touchdowns, one a brilliant 41-yard
gallop, passed for another, and passed for a pair of two-point

conversions,

The coach also singled out

“It was the best game Fred has played so. far,"
Said Michelosen. , ‘ ,

Bill Bodle and Joe Kuzneski H

for praise in the exciting victory. Bodle rushed for 32 yards
and. caught four passes for 34 yards. He picked up three key
ﬁrst downs in the third touchdown drive, which put the Pan-

thers ahead 23-21 in the third

guarter. He also picked up

two ﬁrst downs in the ﬁnal drive which iced the game.
Kuzneski, who has played mostly defense, during his career

here, caught 6 passes for 70 yards

and was Mazurek’s favorite re-

ceiver throughout the day. He constantly broke loose from his de-
fenders to catch key passes. “Joe has improved greatly,” said

Michelosen. “His added maturity

In the ﬁrst half, however, the Panthers looked like the

yards out Saturday at West Chester to give the Rams a 1-0
Win over the Panther soccer team and completely cr.ush any

hopes the Panthershad of repeat-¢

the NCAA tourney.-

It was the ﬁfth shut-out the
Panthers wereinvolved in in eight
games. Their season record is..now

“Weplayed generally a good
defensive-“game,” said coach Leo
Bemis. “Tom Staab played a beau-
tifulgame (at goalie). They had
more decisive shots than we did,
but Tom kept us in the game.” In
addition, Staab also maintains his
one-goal-per—game average.

“They also played a good, tough
defensive game,” Bemis added,
“although we got through with
centers and crosses, but we didn’t
get anyone in position to his the.
ball. It was real windy and it
was difficult for both teams to
control the ball once it was in the
all‘. " ( ‘-

“Just before the goal was
scored,” Bemis went on, “one of
our fullbacksx cleared the ball

away from our goal, but none
of our men could‘ get to. it. There
were several players in front of
the goal, so Staab didn’t actual-
ly see Reynolds until he began
to hit "the ‘ball. Staab was just
able to get his ﬁnger tips on it,
but it went in. .
“The game was very tight and

“Our big problem,” he said. "‘is’

we lack a‘ center forward.” Bemis

he seems to have found himself.
He has tried some of the wings
and insides at center-forward, but

  THE PENN MUTUAL LIFE INSURANCE
    coM1=ANv

Andy Kuzneski graduated from the University of Pittsburgh ‘in 1962 as did» John Mesher in
1960. In addition to being active in campus organizations, both represented the Panthers in athle-
tics. Andy was a memberof the football squad and John of the basketball team during their
undergraduate days.

 

;

Both joined the James E. Eckenrode,,Jr., Agency in Pittsburgh immediately after graduation.
Each qualiﬁed as a" member of the Company Presidents Club after their ﬁrst year. Andy and John
are good examples of the many college men who join Penn Mutual. As such, the following inter-
view with them should be of interest to men now concerned -with choosing a career . . . a career
that can be entered immediately upon graduation. '

WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE ON A LIFEINSURANCE CAREER. ANDY?

There were, many reasons. I like the idea of unlimited opportunity for personal progress
.‘ and one that brought recognition with ac-
. and the prestige that

WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE on PENN MUTUAL AN6 ECKENRODE AGENCY. JOHN?

This_Company_, has had an outstanding record in the insurance industry for over 100 years.

It has been represented in Pittsburgh for 86 of those years. The Eckenrode Agency has come to

be known throughout the Company as “The Agency of Progress.” This success has been brought
about by the dynamic leadership of our General Agent, a thorough training program, and the warm
friendly atmosphere which has the proper combination of the .drive and enthusiasm of
youth, coupled with the wisdom and technique of years of experience.

Our agents have an excellent record of accomplishment.

For example, six of our associates are members of the Penn Mutual Million ‘Club. Manage-
ment qualities do not go unnoticed either. In the past nineteen years this Agency has produced 16
general agents, and _vice-presidents, and the first president of the Institute of Life Insurance Holgar
J. Johnson, who incidentally, is a Pitt graduate. ' 1

WHAT KIND OF TRAINING -HAVE YOU HAD. JOHN?

A'comprehensive program of classroom work and on‘-the~job experience for the ﬁrst three

years.

IN SUMMARY. ANDY. WHAT TYPE or MAN SHOULD cHoosE A CAREER
m INSURANCE? A - “

It isn’t so «much his background or education that should be considered, as it is the type
of person. He ‘should have ambition and drive, with a desire to do well on his own. If he is per-
sonable and mature, wants success and is willing to work for it, that man should certainly look
into life insurance. Long and hard. - ' V

Publications Board Weighs Criticism of ‘News’

(Continued from Page 1)

while and start making phone
calls before writing another
article.

Landy, appointed to the Board
after his own suggestion -last
week; ﬁlls out what Chairman,
Director of Student Publications
Irving N. Rothman, calls “a body
more critical of University publi-
cations than any other since it is
fully aware of the potential of the
newspaper’s_ inﬂuence.

Not to Censor‘

The committee, not of censor-
ship but of national evaluation of
all the affairs of the publications
staffs, includes people experienced
both in University affairs and in
publications. 0 t h e r members

present Thursday included »Miss_

Helen P. Rush, Dean of Students;
Mrs. Agnes Starrett, editor of the
University of_ Pittsburgh Press;
Dr. Abe Laufe, representing the
English department; and Stanley
Knoll and Stanley Stein, repre-
senting national Journalism hon-
orary Pi Delta Epsilon. .
Russell Jalbcrt’, Director of
Public Relations, and Dr. Alan
C. Rankin, assistant chancellor
of student and general affairs
were unable to attend.

In its position of evaluating the
role of publications to the Uni-
versity and making recommenda-
tions to the Director of Student
Publications, R o t h m a n feels

tions,” Landy pointed out. “I
wanted to see just how it works,
and it’s amazing how it broadens
your idea of how publications
operate.” - .
. He remarked that he hadn’t re-
alized the problem The Pitt News
has had with space since the cut
down in cigarette advertising had
necessarily reduced the ‘number
of pages this year.

“Understanding problems like
these, which an outsider couldn’t
be fully aware of, will deﬁnitely
help SG with a more rational ap-
proach toward our investigation.
Thislis one reason why I am per-

sonally working with the commit-
tee evaluating the paper to be
able to bring these things to the
students’ attention and make our
criticism more va1ed.”

  He has it at Western Electric

John La'Cost received his B.S.E.E. from the Uni-
versity of Illinois in 1962. One of the factors which
influenced him to join Western Electric was the
quick manner in which new engineers become
operational. . ’ ~

,- During the shorttime John has been with us, he
has worked in several areas which are vital to the
nation's communications complex. And with his
future development in mind, John attendedone of
our Graduate Engineer Training Centers where he
studied the front—llne Electronic Switching System.
He is currently working as a systems equipment
engineer on such projects as cross bar switching
_and line link pulsing.

John's future at Western,Electric looks promis-
ing indeed. He knows he will be working with revo-
lutionary and advanced engineering concepts like
electronic switching, thin film circuitry, computer-

controlled production lines and microwave sys-
tems. He is also aware of the continued opportunity
for advanced study through the Company-paid
Tuitlon(Refund Plan, as well as through Company
training centers. ,

How do you see yo_u_r future? If you have high
personal standardsand the qualifications we are
looking for, we should talk. Opportunities for fast-
moving careers exist now, not only for electrical,
mechanical and industrial engineers, but also for
physical science, liberal arts and business majors.
For more detailed information, get your copy of
the Western Electric Career Opportunitiesibooklet
