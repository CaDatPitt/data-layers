The sway of symphonic music, under
the superb direction of one ofthe
greatest‘ artists‘ that the Russian em-
pire has produced, Modest Altschuler,
has been more than unusually’ exem-
pliﬁed at the Exposition music hall
this week. The Russian S-yrnphony

ica, began its engagement atthe Pitts-
burgh Exposition last Monday. Out
of the ordinary for this notable or-

with it for the ﬁrsttiem of Miss l\ia.rie
Morrisey, a contralto soloist of New

to a perfect.‘ artistic resonance, w'u‘.h’
expression and quality, has held spell-
bound thousands of people. The great
and rare gift of this young artist has
.been~rendered\theL more alluring be-
cause of her ownpersonal charms and

, William C.-Coffin, '83, President of
the General Alumni Association of the
University, has severed his connec-
tion with the Jones &_Laugh1in Steel
Company to become vicepresident of
new Knox plant at Wheatland, Pa.,
Company of Pittsburgh. Mr. Coil-ln
was vice president of the Riter-Conley
Manufacturing Company from 1898 to
1908, and __since then has been
structural engineer of the Jones &

liaughlin Steel Company. His new of-
rice will include also the duties of

general sales manager and he will do-
vote his entire time to his new con-
nection.

The approaching completion of the.

new Knox plant at Wheatland, I‘a.,
was the deciding factor that brought
Mr. Coﬂin to the company. This plant
will make riveted and welded steel

plate Work, while the cpmpany’s pres-,
ent plant at Farrell, Pa., will be con-

tinued in the manufacture of the Knox
patented watercooled devices for
‘openhearth and heating furnaces. The
Knox Pressed and Welded Steel Com-

pany «li-as"equipped 38 openhearth stem-l,

Big Gathering of Athletic Not-

Gym After‘ Carlisle Game.

GLENN WARNER TO SPEAK

Secretary Robert E. Grove, '14, of
the “Varsity Letter Club,” is making
arrangements for a grand “get-to-A
gether” of that organization in the
Trees Gymnasium Saturday evening,
October 16th, after the Carlisle Indian

game. at Forbes Field. A splendid pro-
' gram will_ be arranged and it is ex-

pected that 150 or 200 letter men of
Pitt will attend.

Head Coach Glenn S. Warner, of

the football team, will be one of the
speakers, and there will be other lead-
ing lights in the athletic line of Pitt
who will have something interesting
tosay. iThe 1915 football squad will
atgnd in a body as special guests. It
w- ‘ be a good chance to meet the
boys and size them up. We vouch
for it that they are a mighty ﬁne lot.

‘It will be a very informal affair and ,

the set speech-making will be tabooed.
There will likely be several amateur
boxing and wrestling matches, some
swimming exhibitions, etc. The “cats”
won't be neglected,.either,' the aid-the-
track house culinary forces being en-
listed totake‘ care of this feature.
The “Varsity Letter Club” is a
ﬂourishing organization of over 100
members now and is growing, every
day. Many new members were se-
cured during the summer. It is ex-
pected that all these members will be

.out October 16th and that many other

letter men will «enlist. ‘All members
have been provided with the oﬂicial
pin-——a gold affair selling for $1.00. -If
members haven't been wearing the
pin regularly now‘ is the time to start.

Notices will be be sent out in the vry
near future by Secretary Grove and
members are urged to boost the “get-
‘together” to all letter men they ‘meet.

Big Hit at Last June Af-
fairs -— Alumni Banquet a
Great Success. ’

MANY “OLD BOYS” BACK

As the last issue of “The Weekly";
was published before the commence-
ment alumni doings could be chron-
icled, it A‘ is well to go back to the;
month of June and tell of some of the 
activities of the “grads” about that!
time. - ‘

The closing event —— the annual

alumni ‘banquet, held at the Hotel

Schenley commencement evening-—
was the crowning feature of a great
week. With Ambassador George W.
Guthrie,,of the class of 1866, as the
principal speaker, and the big‘ ban-
quet hall at the Schenley packed to
the very doors with an enthusiastic,
lively gathering of -“grads” and their
wives, students and other friends of
the University, there was a snap and

remember-ed by all who attended. Geo.
M. Kirk, the favorite cheer leader, was
on from Washington, D. C., to direct
the cheers, and he made good with
a vengeance. He didn't permit a lull
during the entire evening. Harry S.
Calvert, '93, proved a very efficient
toastmaster. Many members of the
senior class attended and. became mem-
bers of the Alumni Association. Pres-
ident W. C. Coflin, ’83', presided at the
chair ceremony.

.The class reunions during the week
were well attended, many having din-
ners, luncheons or banquets. Several
of the classes had, pictures taken on
the campus. Headquarters were in the
“Alumni tent" on the campus between
State and Thaw Hall. A representa-
tive of the Alumni Secretary's office
was on hand during the entire week,
and student guides were there to show
the “grads” around the campus and
through the buildings. Several hun-
dred alumni registered. Free lemon-
ade was served at the tent commence-
ment day, “Dory” Moore, the very ef-
ﬁcient "chef of the football champ, be-
ing in charge of this important fea-
ture. ' . ‘

The 1915 commencement was, it is’
hoped, the start of greater alumni ac-
tivities at that particular time of the
year. Many new-. plans‘ will be de-
vised for next, year. Readers of the
Alumni page of “The Weekly” will be
fully advised of them.-.

ALUMNUSI  

Venerable, James T. Lutton, of
Class of 1845, Passed Away
Last June After Active
Career. I "

LOYAL TO ALMA MA1TER'

James Taylor Lutton, aged 86, who
had the distinction of being the oldest
living alumnus of the University, died
June 26th at his home, 410 South At-
lantic avenue, Pittsburgh. Mr. Lutton
did not graduate‘ from our University,
but attended in the year 1845. He took
a lively interest ,in the -affairs of his
alma mater and was ever loyal to her.

At the last Charter Day banquet of
the General Alumni Association, held
at the Hotel Schenley, February 26th,
1913, Mr. Luttggi, accompanied by his
daughter, l\iiss"i*«Marcella Lutton, at-
tended as honor guests. Although it
was seen that his health was failing
rapidly ‘no one who met him there real-
ized that he would be called to the
great beyond so quickly‘.

Miss Lutton toldlhe Alumni Secre-
tary afterwards that her father's at-
tendance at the banquet and the re-
ception he received from the “Old
Grads” of Pitt was a source of great
joy to, him. One of the things that
pleased him most was his meeting
“Pa” Brashear there and talking over
old times with him. He had long
awaited this opportunity.

Mr. Lutton was a paid-up member
of the General Alumni Association and
a constant reader of the “Pitt Week-
ly.” In going through the ﬁles the
General Secretary ran across the fol-

lowing little note, dated Jany 1, 1915, .

from the venerable alumnus:

My Dear Mr. Davis: ' ‘ -
This is my 86th birthday and I am

trying to be as happy as possible. I

wish you all success in your under-

taking to get members for the Alumni

Association. -Let meknow when you

are to havethe next game with the

W. & J. and I will help you towin.

1 - Yours truly,

JAMES T. LUTTON.

Monday's football practice
scrimmage at Forbes Feld was the
first opportunity that local enthusi-
asts had to see the team under the
direction of the new coach, Glenn
Warner. After three weeks hard
practice the forty odd men who were
up at Camp Hamilton, reported at
,classes_ Monday and‘ at three-thirty
iran out on the recently vacated base-
tball field and watched by several. hun-
;.dred students and members of the

mighty .good football was seen inthe‘
half hour tussle that was staged. _.

No mantis .sur-efof his place on the
team and this was blearly seen by the

‘Way. in which the ‘two. squads went

after each other. The men were in
earnest and went to itwithj no holds

barred. One notacquaintedtrwith the

team might have ‘-thbught that they
were two rival schools playing each
other with the national championship
at stake. I

Peck playing-between Soppitt and
Sutherland looks like a_ dwarf. But
the center that opposes “Bob” this
year will have a different opinion after
the “doc” pronounces him out of dan-
ger. *

The Geneva team that played so
well against the Red and Black Satur-

day had two men who were formerly.

on Pitt teams in the past. few years.
Ward, who was :a -tetter man at the
University for three years, was on

one half, and Mccarter, who was on‘
the squadfor afew weeks ‘last year ‘

held down the other half, With Ward,

they ever had’. The’-shorwing they

Glenn Warner’s reputation for being
the silent man of football‘ -was borne
out when a representative. of THE
PITT VVEEKLY interviewed him yes-
terday. When
that the training camp haduput the
boys in ﬁne condition. Further ques-

had not seen any of them in an inter-
collegiate contest this fall, as yet. For
talkitiveness he and Bill Hinchman
would make a ﬁne’ match.

a way about ‘handling’ the men that

practically assured that if the Blue

‘the ‘Penn team will travel to Pitts-
burgh for a game next fall. The ar-

near future. Several hundred people

through the‘ agency of a shot gun and

other included the recourse of the
Pennsylvania Dutch farmers to the
country squires of the same afﬂiction.
Thereupon the apple-cooning trips

of they stay inthe camp was the corn
roast. It was on this occasion that
Coach Warner demonstrated to the“ as-

‘ semblage that he was fully‘ as~proﬁ-

_cie-nt in the diﬂicult part of roasting
corn in just the proper manner as" he
was in the formation and manipulation
of a football machine. Early in the

inga bevy of the fairer-sex to enliven
the occasion, and from that moment
to the time wlfen the last benzine
buggi roared up the hill on its home-
war 1way, “Camp Hamilton” forgot
itself in the revelryiand jollity attend-
lngthe corn roast. 1 C ' . —

When time came for the homeward
trip thereiwas not _a man in thewcamp
who was not glad to go and was yet
fully. satisﬁed with his stay’1n,- the
training quarters. Warner’s method of
giving the men such a variety of work
toward the same end kept the spirits
of ‘the men at the highest possible‘
pitch and went a great way toward
rendering the work less irksome than
the ordinary repetition that is cus-
tomary in the early training periods.
The squad came out of the early train-
ing days with minimum of injuries
so that it is “able to enter the next
period of its autumn training with a
large «number of experienced, seasoned
and conﬁdent members. *

" FIELD WORK.1-

N-otwithstanding the increased cost
oftuition in the various schools of
the University the registration is much
larger than ever before. This is due
largely to the efforts of the various
ﬁeld men, who spent the summer tell-
ing ambitious young men and women
of the advantages.offered by the Uni-

_ ensityt. Inlooking over statistics and

of the men it is very efident
that these men had a successful sum-
men. The ﬁeld men help the Univer-

of service to the youth of the coun-

"try, for they ‘are often instrumental in

assisting young people to a higher
education, who, withoutvtheir encour-
agement, would be afraid‘ to make the
venture. _ 1

‘NEW ALUMNI DIRECTORY

OUT IN *FEBRUARY."

 (Continued,—from'pa”ge 3‘)

'_ At the presenttime the foundation’
work on the Directory is about com-
pleted. Within the near‘ few Weeks.

There are only seven lines on the re-
turn postal and -the ﬁlling out ofdata
desired is not _a tedious task._ It is
hoped that at large percentage of the
former students will return the pos-
-tals. ‘ . ‘
After the postals are all in and care-
fully ch-ecked/the work of com ‘ling
the information for‘ the Director will
be completed and copy gotten into the
hands of the publisher. The Directory
will be a paper-‘bound affair. It will
be nothing elaborate from the stand-
,point of artistic printing, but it. is
he ed to have it accurate, which is the
main object. It will contain ‘three
lists of the graduates, one arranged al-
phabetically, one according to classes
and departments, and one according to
states and towns or cities. Between
6,500 and 7,000 names will be shown,
including all known former students
of? Pitt dating back over a century to
;the time of, the old Pittsburgh Acad-
emy. 1 -’ 1 _ , v

About 300 graduates of the Scio Col-
l-ege of Pharmacyswill be*incorporated*
in the list, as by official action of ‘the
Board of Trustees theyare considered
alumni of the University. The Scio
‘School of Pharmacy was consolidated
with the University. Pharmacy School
some time ago, it will be recalled. A
special letter w-as sent to these alumni
telling them of the action of the..Board
-of Trustees. " '

With such a. corrected list offormer
students the’ University and the Alum-
ni Association will have an asset, the
lackvof which has been a severe han-
dica.-pe during the .past fewyears.

In checking the names of former stu-
dents a list of perhaps ﬁve hundred
"unknown.s” has developed. These are,‘
men and women whose addresses can-.

ing methods’ used. ,We- have their
names an-dldepartment and class, but
no town or state address. A printed
list of these “unknowns” will go in the
letter, with postal card, and alumni
will greatly favor the secretary by
checking over and seeing if they can

ranged according to classes and de-
partments.

The getting out of this Alumni.Di-
rectory has involved a tremendous
amount of detail work. With the 1915-
16 Directoryas afoundation, however,
and present plans calling for its par-
tialor complete revision annually, the
work will be simpliﬁed in the future.
The Directory will be disposed of at
a reasonable .sum to the alumni. It
will be s_omethlng highly prized by all
Pitt men. .

lNSTRUCTION_S ISSUED. ‘ 1

Before the members of the 1915
graduating class "officially severed
their connection with the University
as undergraduates, Life Secretaries
were selected either by vote or ap-
pointment, for all departments. These
Life Secretaries ‘are expected to play

bers of their class alive as regards
alumni affairs, as the selections were,’
it is believed, very wise ones. Fol-
lowing is the list of secretaries:

.9 Each‘ Life Secretary was ,furnislied

-with writteninstructions covering his ;

or cherduties. For lack of space these
cannot be published with‘.th1s article.
We. hope to print .them in the next

issue, so that the 1915 men and others 1

will be entirely familiar with the sys-
tem.

The Life Secretary plan is in effect
at Yale and other institutions where
the alumni "organization is most ef-
fi.cient, and is a cog in the. general
machinery which we‘ hope to have in-
..sl.;alled shortly. which will make our
ialt mni affairs equally asstrong.

Already. the Life Secretaries are ac-
tive and through their efforts many
members of the Alumni Association
have been secured who did not attend
the June banquet. It will be their
duty to “boost? class reunions, keep
tra’“ck»of their members, furnish news
items for “The 1 Weekly" regarding
them, etc. “ , —
