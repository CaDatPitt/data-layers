.1)  Weddington

By Lou Grieco
News Editor

Even though the two women weren’t
speaking to each other, Melinda Holben,
student coordinator of the Pitt Program
Council, was still surprised to ﬁnd them
sitting together in the PPC ofﬁce. One of
the women later told her “I guess we don’t
have that much in common.”

However, Sarah Weddington, who
defended Jane Roe in the 1973 Supreme
Court case Roe vs. Wade, and Phyllis
Schlaﬂy, a conservative activist who helped
defeat the Equal Rights Amendment had
plenty to say to each other during the
PPC’s “Abortion Debate” last night.

Weddington was the first to speak at the
debate, which was divided into a 15
minute opening statement by each speaker,
a 5 minute rebuttal for both, and then a
question and answer session with the
audience. _

“I’ve come to ask for your help,”
Weddington opened. “Since Roe vs. Wade
in 1973, there are some things that have

changed, including the composition of the .

[United States] Supreme Court. Back then,
the justices voted 7-2 to guarantee the
right of privacy.

“By the time Lewis Powell left the bench

it was 4-4, and Anthony Kennedy was '

appointed. Part of the reason that the

Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services _ '
was so important this year was that it was f
the first time we knew who had five 

judges.”

Weddington also noted that three of the 2
justices that dissented in the Webster case §

lastjuly, William Brennan, Harry Blackmun

and Thurgood Marshall are over 80 years A

old, and may be retiring soon.

“At one point, I thought it would be the I
skill of a lawyer that would make the 5
difference [Witl1 the right to choose]. Today, ‘

I’d say it is the enthusiasm and political

support of people who care. I've got to ‘

give [abortion foes] credit; they have
organized and we haven’t. We have the
numbers, we need the organization.”
Schlaﬂy, who referred to Roe vs. Wade
as “the worst decision in the history of the
Supreme Court,” began by noting the
importance of the yesterday’s political
events in Harrisburg, when the State Senate

passed a bill restricting abortions. She '_ 

added that these were not extreme
measures.

“These provisions sound very reasonable I

to me,” she said. “One of them asks for a

24 hour waiting period. What could be I

more reasonable than that?

“They also ask that the father of the baby H

Annual Jazz concert  

may be Pitt's last

By Shelena Rauscher
Staff Writer

I The 19th Annual Jazz Seminar
will begin at Pitt on Nov. 1, but
this year the organization is
suffering from a severe lack of
funding.

The Pennsylvania Council of
Arts cut the funds by 31 percent,
with the budget set for $32,000.
Student Activities and Student
Government each donated
$2,000. The PCA allocated $7,000.
The rest comes from ticket sales
for the final concert on Nov. 4.

“Even if we sell out the house

up/e will still be in the red. Before,

we had $2,000 or $3,000 left for
the nextyear, “ said Nathan Davis,
director of jazz studies at Pitt. “If
we don’t make money, then the
university will be responsible for
this one time, but if it happens
twice it will be the end. The jazz
seminar must pay for itself.”
According to David Ball, music
program director of the PCA.,one
of the reasons for the cutwas that

 is music program on the PCA

. ceived a decrease in funds, so
= loss was felt throughout the
wire music department. The
fond, he said, was “the feeling

that the organization needs

-jet out and find local funds

at than have just one major

9 :..der.” He said he would “take
back to the panel [that decides

 

who gets the funding]” injanuary.

According to Davis, however,
“it’s all politics. The original
purpose was to bring the jazz

masters to the Pitt campus and 2

have them, lecture and
demonstrate for students. We’ve
succeeded and many critics have
said that the roster reads like a
Who's Who in jazz.

“We’d like to continue and I
feel it’s wrong that the PCA would
single us out and tell us what to
do. The idea of local involvement

is wrong because this is a
university that has certain rules.
Because Pitt has an annual giving
fund, the businesses will want to
be left alone.”

The jazz seminar has been an
annual event in Pittsburgh for the
past 19 years. “When I first came
here I felt there should be a way
for the people who make music
to come into the class and lecture
about it rather than having people

who studied classical lmusicl‘
* teach jazz. I wanted one day a

year to get the best possible
individuals together,” Davis said.
This year the ﬁnal concert that
will bring the “jazz masters”
together will be held on Nov. 4 at
Carnegie Music Hall. The concert
is unique to Pittsburgh because
it’s “the only time these people
play as a unit. This makes it one
of the most talked~about seminars

SGB candidates bid for election

By Kathie Roth
Staff Writer

Choosing which candidates
to vote for in the upcoming
Student Government Board
elections may be a difficult
task in light of the similarity of
the platforms presented at
Monday night’s student
organization meeting. 1

The two presidential
candidates and the 12 students
vying for board positions
presented their views to
representatives of various
student organizations. The
campaigning will continue until
the voting on Nov. 7 and 8
when the president and eight

board members will be

selected. The majority
of the night’s comments were
concerned with the topics of
student services, SGB
allocations, campus safety,
student apathy and the function

of the entire board in relation .

to the student body.
Presidential candidate Kurt
Stark proposed a system of
rating instructors which is
intended to improve
educational student. services.
He said, “I’d like to see a
professor—rating program
which will occur in the class
description guide. It could be

really helpful to freshmen and
[could help] to direct [professors]
attention to teaching.”

When questioned by a
representative of the Resident
Student Association as to how
the candidates would improve
resident life, ideas were proposed
for improving elevators, meal

programs and increasing student

involvement with RSA.

In light of the financial
difficulties involved in adding or
improving services to completed
dormitories, Patrick Abramowich,
who is running for a board
position said, “We need to focus
on the dormitories to come. Past
mistakes cannot be replicated."

These problems of funding
programs for the improvement of
the campus caused several
candidates to speak with student
group representatives concerning
the SGB Allocations Committee
process. Brian Felgoise, a former
member of the committee, said
that he feels the board “needs
wholesale changes. SGB does
not represent you well enough.”

Student safety both on and off
campus was another issue which
was broughtup quite often. Ideas
involved improving the campus
taxi and shuttle services and the
organization of a student security
system. Along these lines Felgoise
also suggested a student guardian

angel

system and Elan Salee
suggested improvement of the
Campus help line.

Salee said that he had
spoken with Director of Public
Safety Bi1l—Brennan concernin g
the assistance of the Freshman
Council in manning the
emergency help line, and
Brennan agreed with the
suggestion.

A representative of the Black
Action Society asked the
presidential candidates what
changes each would make
toward the black student body.
Stark admitted that there is a 7
big gap between the BAS and
the SGB.

However, Julie Shepard, the
other presidential candidate
said, ‘*I’m not afraid to deal
with the controversy that
comes with some of the
minority groups; it’s hard to
work with a group when
you’re not sure what kind of
feedback you’re getting from
them.”

According to Shepard,

representatives of the BAS
have not been present at the
two meetings of the newly
restarted Student,
Representative Group.

Other candidates also

be notiﬁed. Doesn’t the father
have any right at all? All you have
to do is tell the guy you're going

to kill his unborn baby.”
Schlaﬂy asserted that the
abortion industry was ﬁlled with
counselors that receive “kick

backs” for advising women to -

have abortions, and called
abortion “the largest unregulated
industry in this country.”

“The people of this country
would be shocked to learn that
98 percent of all abortions in this
country are done for non—medical
reasons.” _

Schlafly said the words of
Thomas Jefferson do not support
abortion because “the idea that
your rights as an individual comes
from our creator, and it is the job
of government” to protect this.

Weddington noted in "her
rebuttal that Jefferson owned
slaves. She also said thatStephen
Freind, . the state legis1ature’s
leading abortion opponent, is

“known all over the nation as the
man who said women who are
raped can’t get pregnant, because
they secrete some secretion.

“He, has of course, since then
apologized and said that this is
untrue.”

Weddington also said that the

legislation was designed to‘

“harass women, and make it more
difficult for them to have
abortions.”

Schlaﬂy went on to say during
her rebuttal that “Miss
Weddington attacks Pennsylvania

_ legislation on what she deduces

are lFreind’s] motives.jThe motive

is not the I issue. We are not

debating. when life begins, but
. when life ends.

“We are told that the end of
brain waves is the end of life.
Fetuses have brain waves. Why
isn’t the beginning of brain waves
the beginning of life.”

Some of the performers will be
trumpet players Donald Byrd,
Benny Bailey and Arturo
Sandoval; drummer ldris
Muhammad; keyboard player
Patrice Rushen; Abraham Laboriel
on bass; and Johnny Griffin,
Nathan Davis and Sonny Rollins
on saxophone. Each of the
performers will give afree clinic
discussing their speciality.

The performers were chosen
by ‘a committee of people

throughout the university system. _

There are three basic criteria for
their decisions: the performers
must be able to operate as a solo
act, work with the other
performers and be a “proven jazz
master” in Davis’ opinion.

The primary focus - of the
seminar is to educate ‘people
about jazz. Davis said, “Thereis

one thing that I’m concerned ,
about. The concert is so unique.

There seems to be more emphasis
on the concert. The idea was to
bring masters in touch. I would
like more emphasis on the
educational part.”

commented upon the need to

unite students not only racially
but in other matters as well. Jay
Gervasoni, campaigning for the
board, stressed the need to unite
all student groups. “The concerns
of one student are the concerns
of the whole university.”

Another major issue discussed
by the candidates was the
effectiveness and the student
awareness of the function of the
SGB. .

Andrew Lentvorski, board
candidate, said, “Student
Government Board needs the
exposure and the accountability
as well. The .SGB within the
administration itself does not have
sufficient credibility.”

Katie Malaspina, who is also
running for board, said, “I have a
desire to work for the students. I
want to work through these
problems and the red tape.”

Acquaintance wipe a common problem in society

By Sharon Romanovich
For The Pitt News

It was just a party. »They’d
partied together before. Kelsey
and her boyfriend Joe were at
Jack’s house, along with many of
their friends. Everyone was
drinking and having a good time.
Everyone trusted each other, and
no one felt uncomfortable.

As the night wore on, people
began to settle down. Joe fell
asleep, and Kelsey and a few
Others continued to drink —
except Jack; he hadn’t had a
single drink all night. Kelsey got
so drunk that she could not hold
her own head up; sojack decided
he would “take care” of her. He
took her into a bedroom, held

her head while she vomited into .

a bucket, and then proceeded to
have sex with her. ‘

“It wasn’t violent in that I had
bruises or scratches on my body.
However, I did not, could not,
give my consent to the act
perpetrated against me. It wasn’t
until two months later, while I
was in therapy, that I even
considered what happened to
me as a rape. My counselor said
to me, ‘Cut the crap, you were
raped!’ “ said Kelsey.

Kelsey is now a statistic; she
joins the countless other women

' who have been raped by someone

they know. She is a victim of
acquaintance rape.

According to Ellen Kerr,
volunteer coordinator for
Pittsburgh Action Against Rape,
acquaintance rape is highly
prevalent, especially in high
schools and on college campuses.
Of all rapes involving women 18
and under, 95 percent of the
victims knew the rapist. In cases

of rape involving adult women
over 18, 65 percent of all victims
were raped by someone they
knew.

“People of high school and
college age are more at risk
because they are looking for
companionship, dates. It’s more
prevalent in college

because there is more freedom
in people’s lives. Students have
their own places and easier access
to private spaces,” said Kerr.

In spite of the common
occurrences of acquaintance
rapes, they are still the least
reported. Legal authorities record
one out of every 10 rapes reported
as an acquaintance rape.
Pittsburgh ‘Action Against Rape
records at least seven out of 10
rapes reported to them as
acquaintance rapes.

“We don’t really know the

‘ statistics on date rape. My own

feeling is that every single woman
gets raped. at some point in her
life,” said Kerr. “That comes from
if you’ve said to someone, ‘Yes, I
want to be sexual with you’— do
you feel, in the middle of it, that
you have the right to pull out?
The right to say, ‘I don’t like this.
This isn’t what I expected.’ How
many women feel they have the
right to say or do that?

“There is so much confusion ‘

in a date rape, about whether the
woman made it happen. Even
the victims call us and say, ‘I
don’t really think I was raped, but
 .’ This comes from the blaming

of victims in general, even if it’s a
stranger—rape. Take the jury in
Florida who acquitted an accused
rapist by saying the woman asked
for it by the way she was dressed.
She was at fault. She made it
happen.

“That's ridiculous. If a woman
wants to look nice, she should
dress how she feels is right.
Theoretically, you ought to be
able to walk down the street with
nothing on and still feel safe
[from rapel.”

‘According to Kerr, society plays
a" role‘ in the hiding of an
acquaintance rape by doubting a
woman who says she has been
raped and assuming she must
have done something to provoke
the attack.

“A survey was done of high
school and college students,” she
said. “In this survey they were
asked, ‘Is it OK for a boy to hold
a girl down and force her to have
sexual intercourse if . . .?’ and there
were different situations following
this introduction. The students
were asked to answer yes or no.
Forty percent of the men and 12
percent of the women answered
‘yes, if he spends a lot of money
on her.’

“Thirty—six percent of the men
and 21 percent -of the women
answered ‘yes, if [he] is so turned
on [he] can’t stop.’ Forty percent
of the men and 20 percent of the
women answered ‘yes, if she had
intercourse before.’

“And, amazingly, 51 percent of

the men and 42 percent of the
women answered ‘yes, if she got
him sexually excited.’ Men need
to listen when their girlfriends
are saying, ‘Not now,’ or ‘No, I
don’t want to do that sexually.’
There is very little discussion
about sex when there should be
a lot.”

Along with an acquaintance
rape, there is a loss of trust, not
only toward others but loss of
trust in one’s own judgment. “The
self-blame is so intense,” said
Kerr. “lThis is because] it’s yourself
that has betrayed you because
the man has taken advantage of
a trusting situation. The victim
finds herself uncomfortable being
alone with a man.

“She is always asking, ‘How-

will I know? How can I trust my
own judgment? When will I ever
be safe again?’ There is the whole
feeling of never knowing, never
being safe. There’s lots and lots
of discomfort.” .

According to Kerr, an attempted
rape brings on the same feelings
as the actual rape. Victims have
the same feelings of inadequacy
in their judgment and the same
feelings of guilt. They blame
themselves, ‘just as women who
were actual1y_raped do.

Kerr feels that in order to lower

the risk of acquaintance rape, the
change must begin in the home
for both boys and girls.

“Boys shouldn’t be brought up
thinking they have to be in control
all of the time,” she said. “They
shouldn’t be brought up thinking
women are somehow subhuman.
Girls should be taught to stick up
for themselves. They need to be
taught to think they are important.

“Girls should be able to say
‘NO!’ and get a response. They
need to learn not to send mixed
messages. They need to make it
clear in their own minds what
they want. Girls don’t have to
settle for less. They don’t need to
be with someone who doesn’t
listen, or who crowds them.

“Different reactions work. If
you find yourself in this situation,
talk, yell, cry, try everything.

Women call and say they got out ,

of it by using these different
tactics. A woman is taught that
fighting is not proper, that it’s not
‘ladylike.’ Woman aren’t allowed
to get angry.

“They say that if you are violent,
it will escalate the violence. But
you don’t have to be nice when
someone’s threatening your life.
If all else fails, kick, punch,
scratch, do whatever it takes to
get out of there. Forget what‘ you
were taught, and fight like hell.”‘

Promises, ipromises, promises

It seems that some of the Student Government Board
candidates are under the perverse notion that they can
control what we print. ,' ,

Presidential candidate Julie Shepard has indicated in her
platform that she would “like to see an ‘SGB Corner’ in
The Pitt News thatwould not only give an update of SGB
activities, but would allow a means of holding SGB
members accountable for the promises they make.”

C} Monday night at the student organization meeting,

board candidate Robert P. Batchelor said that he wants an
SGB blotter, similar to the campus police blotter, and a
“president’s spot,” whatever that means. Incidentally,
Batchelor also said that he is running on the slate with

Julie Shepard.

Michael Cohen, another board candidate, also vowed to

' give smaller groups advertising for their meetings in The

Pitt News. “If I-were elected, I’d see that it will be done,”
he boasted. . ,

First off, we’d like to know from what authority they got
this power. As we have said repeatedly on our perspec-
tive page, we are completely independent from the
university. This includes those little wonders of Student
Government. ’ _ ‘

A Our revenues come from our advertisers, and student
groups are offered a discount rate. Unless these candi-
dates intend on using money from the student activities
fee to pay for their advertising, then these promises will
not be accomplished. I ,

It can also be noted that no one in The Pitt News office
knew anything about these “plans.” ‘

Of course, it wouldn’t be an SGB campaign ifvague
promises weren’t made without any stated plans for
execution. The standard, rnake—Oakland-safer, real-food-
in-the-cafeterias, cable-TV-hookups-in-the-dorms pledges
were all promised again this year, with no ideas on how

(ghese things would be accomplished. I I

So, the reality is that either these candidates are mislead-
ing the groups for votes by leaving out the fact that student
money must be allocated for these additions to our paper,
or the candidates are so uninformed themselves that they
have no business running for office.

We challenge this year’s candidates to let everyone in on
the secrets behind these ideas. And to _the representatives
of the student groups who suffered through over two
hours of this misinformation, we’d like to share some

“iidvice . that someone recently shared with us: Don’t
believe the hype.

PPC responds vialetter... this time  

‘In response to the recent edito-
rial concerning the students’ right
to know where their money is
going, I, as a student, whole-
heartedly agree.

And, as the Student Coordina-
tor of the Pitt Program Council, I
am more than willing to disclose

any andall information, financial -

or otherwise that students may
request concerning organizational

operations, provided that request 

is made in a timely and profes-
sional manner.

Unfortunately, for the many
students who are concerned
about how their money is being
spent, ThePitt News has failed in
their responsibility to their stu-
dent readers by not taking the
time to gather the facts needed to
make a comprehensive and in-

‘ formative story on the MTV

Remote Control show presented
by the Pitt Program Council on
Wednesday, Oct. 11.

The Pitt News staff has repeat-
edly refused to professionally
request information from the’ Pitt
Program Council; rather they have
rudely demanded on-the-spot
answers to ﬁnancial questions
that take time for us to prepare.
And as we are not interested in
divulging false information to our
fellow, students for whom we
work, we chose not to answer
such questions until such a time
that a definite ﬁgure could be
released.

The Pitt News, on the other
hand, saw it necessary to guess
the amount paid to MTV rather
than to wait until the exact dollar
amount was known to us at the
Pitt Program Council.

The Pitt Program Council is a
student-run organization com-
prised of a Student Coordinator,
11 Committee Chairpeople, 175
Committee Members, and Board
of Governors, all of whom are
Pitt students. .

We also have an advisor, T om
Misuraca, Assistant Director of
Student Activities, and a program

coordinator, Dana Keefer, both ,

of whom are full-time university
administrators. Their function in
the Pitt Program Council is, as
their titles imply, to advise the
student. ._ Executive Board in

making decisions concerning 
the student body. In addition to
advising the Executive Board, Mr.
Misuraca’s approval and signa-.
ture [are] needed to authorize
contracts and payments made by,
the university. _ ' I ‘

 

Despite the fact that the Pitt
Program Council... is a vstudent_;_
organ”i'z=at’i6r1‘ ruff "almost ‘ehtiirely
by students, The Pitt News has
chosen to wrongly ‘attack our
advisor, Mr. Misuraca, rather than

seek correct information, from I

either myself or the chairperson
of the committee ’ that pro-
grammed the event. I —

The Pitt News has consistently
estimated or guessed as to facts
and figures associated with vari-
ous Pitt Program Council events.
We can only assume that this
irresponsible journalism is a re-
sult of the writer’s inability to
acquire exact information in a
professionally acceptable man— “
ner.

We at the Pitt Program Council
realize our responsibility to the .
students of this university, and
we feel we have provided a wide
scope of entertaining, cultural
and educational programs for
them to take advantage of. But if
a student is dissatisfied with any .
aspect of the Pitt Program Coun-
cil, it is their right to come to us
with their concerns. Further, our
open door membership policy
invites all students to join any or
all of the 11 committees and take
an active role in choosing the
programs we present as well as
participating in the execution of
those programs. ’

In the future, we hope that The
Pitt Newswill take their journalis-
tic responsibility to the students
as seriously as we have taken
their interests.

THE Pl'lT NEWS, Wednesday, October 25, 1989

 

Students shouldn't miss out on the joys of disection

. The leg bone is connected to

V. the knee bone...

However, such basic inforrna-

tion as this may never have be-

come common knowledge with-

 , out the use of certain animals for
. dissection. '

V Many people” object to using
animals for scientific research,
-and it is not uncommon for high
school students to wrinkle their

noses in disgust at the mere.
thought of slicing open a frog, or i

even an earthworm. A

But without the knowledge
gained from looking at a speci-
men, as opposed to two-dimen-
sional pictures of an animal, sci-

, ence and medicine would still be
stuck in the middle ages.

Nevertheless,‘ a student in a
California high school did not
feel that she should be forced to‘
dissect an earthworm, so she
fought the system — and won.

Have you ever wished that you
were somewhere else? There are
many nights when I feel that way.
My problem is my job as photo
editor for ThePittNews. It doesn’t
sound very difficult, but I can
assure. you that it is the main
source of stress in my life.

Why do we put up with so
much stress? I must ask myself

v that every morning at about 1:30

a.m.. when the paper is finally
finished and ready to go to the
_printer. I have classesjust like
- A :__  ....  r
credits this term. I’ve got home-
work and papers to do; And yet,
I ,‘m always running around like
a chicken with its head cut off i
whenever this newspaper feels it
needs me.

I’m one of those people,‘,,y{ho
usually take their frustrations out
on other people. The problem is
that you can only yell at the
assistant news editors so many
times before "they start to get
upset. There has to be a better
way to deal with tension and a
hurried lifestyle. One obvious
solution is to simply skip class.
Obviously, this is a bad idea, but
there are times when I ﬁnd I have »

 

She believes that she could learn
just as much by studying from

pictures of earthworms — ones t

that died of natural causes, of
course. The sad part is that she
was able to convince the state of
California that students could
learn by studying photographs.
For years, high school students
have been required to do some
dissection as part of the general
curriculum. Some students enjoy

it; others ﬁnd it downright dis- A

gusting, but almost all learn
something from it. Pictures may
paint a thousand words, but dis-
section of a real earthworm is
much more informative than any
picture could hope to be.

By just studying from pictures,

a student would completely miss

internal structures that may lie
underneath other structures and
textures of organs and tissues.

. Although it may seem unimpor-

no alternative; My friends may
laugh at me for saying this, but I
really don’t like to miss any of my
classes. It’s just that there are
some days when nobody else
can do the job, and you’re the
only one around. i

I’m afraid Murphy’s Law hasn’t

‘ been very kind to me either. One ,

of these days, Im going to turn
around and choke the next per-
son that operis my darkroom door
while I’m working. Someday, our

and God have mercy on them if
I’m carrying any sharp objects in
my hand. It’s only going to take
a little push, and I’ll be over the
edge. ” ‘ ‘ ' '
It’s fascinating to see what kinds
of side elfec-ts tension: can have

friend and I broke up because we
never had time for each other,
my grades are lower than the

her to be excused from dissec-
tion because she ﬁnds it unappe-

about whether the worm died a
painful death or not.

I Although “Susie”smay not be

If you are a member of any

can probably relate to what I'm
talkinguabout. It doesn’t matter
how large your group is, there
are always three or four people
who are crazy enough to do the
majority of the work. Have you
ever talked to any student ath-
letes? Contrary to popular opin-
ion, they really do have to go

terms; They are even lucky
enough to get to put up with

US. is should not worry so much

By now, everyonefis familiar
with the dispute over the effi-
ciency of America’s educational
system. Until now, I’d ignored
the issue. Why debate an argu-
ment you can’t win? This morn-
ing I received along with my mail
some newspaper clippings from
my grandmother regarding this
problem, encouraging me to rise
above the common rubble of
stupidity currently breeding on
campuses the world over. When
the relatives get involved, it’s
time to address the issue.

There are two major problems
with the attitudes of “scholars”
and “educators.” As reported by
Donald S. Groder and George F.
Will of The Washington Post,
Lynne V. Cheney and Chester
Finn are good examples of people
who represent these problems.

’ Cheney, chairwoman of the
National Endowment for the
Humanities, wants to establish a

“core curriculum” of liberal arts
in colleges and universities na-
tionwide. Armed with the “disap-
pointing” results of the latest
Gallup Poll, she and her support-
ers insist that a broad spectrum of
knowledge is of greater value
than a single, specialized area of
expertise. ‘ «

Finn, regarded as one of the
“wisest voices concerning edu-
cation,” sums up his point in a pat
comment that may be accurate in
assessment but falls short of
accuracy in evaluation. Said Finn,
“Our educators in general are so
transﬁxed by cognitive skill that

as long as you are thinking, it I

does not matter whether you
know anything; as long as you
are reading, it does not matter
what you are reading; as long as
you areiable to analyze, it does
not matter whether you possess
knowledge worth analyzing.”

In other words, Finn believes

that possessing knowledge is

more important than being able :

to use that knowledge.

 

While both arguments have

their merits, they fail to take into

account the crucial element of
common sense. The key word
here is “common.” Something
that is common is knowable and
understandable by all.

One wise man, of a somewhat

less illustrious position, is a desk '

attendant at the University of
Pittsburgh. His description of the
role of common sense is the most
accurate. He explains that every-
one has a different amount of
aptitude in various ﬁelds of
knowledge. Likewise, something

»'I .: ‘14.»..:Z"lRC'u3ZA.NS*3.’ .;. .... _

appreciation of nature being able

“to appreciate the perfection with ‘

which an organism, even one as
simple as an earthworm, is cre-
ated.

And for those who are con-
cerned about the plight of the
fetal pigs used in more advanced
dissection, let me set your mind
at ease and assure you that they
are not brutally or needlessly
killed solely for the purpose of
dissecting them — they come
from butcher houses and would
have been disposed of if supply

‘companies did not prepare them

to be used in the classroom.
Why is it that we can roast a
pig, eat it, and not feel guilty, but
we cannot cut open a frog with-
out hearing screams of disgust
from squeamish students? At least
with the latter, we are learning
something from it —- whereas

to be some insane reason why
people put up with this crap day
in and day out. I
I [talked to a rfewof my fellow
editors who are in the same boat
I am, and Ithink I understand it
now. We actually care about this
newspaper. Believe it or not, I
take my work very seriously, and
I honestly worry about what I
put into this publication. Did you
know that Hillman Library keeps
a copy of every issue we put out?
I want some collegiate journalist
to look back at our work 20 years
from now and say, “I wish we
could be half asgood as those
guys were back in 1989. ”.That’s
the kind of motivation I feel every
time I snap the shutter of my
camera. Maybe you don’t like
our work, but I can at least say
I’ve tried my very best, and I have

something to leave for posterity. /

I imagine the student athletes
and leaders must feel the same
way. The Pitt News sometimes
prints bad editorials about vari-
ous groups, but I often have a
great deal of admiration for them.
There are many at this university
who really do give it their all --
simply because it means some-

eating a piece of meat gives us
nothing but clogged arteries.

As a biology major,.I realize
that I have a vested interest in
dissecting and all that can be
learned from it. However, I do
not feel that a passion for slimy
worms is necessaryto get some-
thing from dissecting one. Even I
do not like worms.

The bottom line isthis: each of (.5

us is forced to do things we may
not particularly like in order to
expand our knowledge. No one
is saying that students must
embrace the art of dissection with
open arms; however, it is the
only way to truly learn what the

‘insides of a worm look like -

aside from how they look

_ squished on the bottom of your C3 »

shoe.

looks good on a resume. One of
the most satisfying things in the
world to me is waking up every

morning and knowing that over ,_

Does this mean that it’s worth

Everybody has to answer that for

some extent. Maybe Pm crazy or

I really think that there’s more to

chance that I’ll be sorry for it
someday, but I doubt it. Life has
a way of throwing you just enough

about liheral studies  

known by one person can be

taught to another. Noeducator

can dispute the truth of these
common sense facts.

The problem presented in the
Gallup P011 is one of point of
view. They can be viewed pes-
simistically (67 percent of the 679
seniors that took the poll could
not place the Civil War in the
correct historical era within 50

a years) or optimistically (53 per- ,

cent could).

According to “Mr. Attendant’s” ’

theory, “the flame will burn as
long as somebody knows.” It
doesn’t matter who or how many,
just as long as someone does.
This refutes Cheney's claim. Mr.
Attendant explains that knowing
a little of everything but not
enough of anything won't help
anyone. If a bridge is to be built,
the engineer is not going to need
to know whether or not

Shakespeare wrote The Tempest.
He will be expected to be able to

design and construct a sturdyﬂ

bridge — no more, no less. Spe-
cialized study leads to better,
faster and more efﬁcient work.
Mr. Attendant is quick to point
out, however, that all the special-
ized knowledge in the world is
useless if not combined with
common sense. Knowing some-
thing doesn’t work is not the
same as knowing why it doesn’t
work. It is in the knowing why or
why not that new developments

I are made and knowledge is fur-

thered. He said, “Common sense
is the glue that puts it all to-
gether.”

So all those scholars can pack

up their Gallup Polls and get oug

QB Rice prime concern for Panthers on Saturday

By Matt Martin
Editor in Chief

Notre Dame quarterback Tony Rice could
never be accused of padding his passing

statistics. The senior Heisman T rophy

candidate has attempted only 89 passes,
completing 49 for 829 yards and two
touchdowns. Pitt’s Alex Van Pelt has
completed 11 more passes than Rice has

. attempted, resulting in 1,414 yards, 10

4,;

touchdowns and the No. 8 pass efficiency
rating in the nation.

So it will be no surprise thatvfor one
game, passing willbe a secondary concern
for Pitt’s defensive backfield.

“Our goal is to stop the run first,”'said
Pitt safety Louis Riddick, who has compiled
25 tackles and one interception. “They
have a great running game, so we've got
to force them to throw the ball. We've got

If the run fails, weight
of Irish battle willfall

to take their strength away.”
The Irish, ranked No. 1 in nearly every

poll imaginable, take 1,803 total rushing

yards and an average of 257.5 yards per
contest into their matchu p with the Panthers
at Notre Dame Stadium on Saturday. Pitt’s
10th—ranked rush defense has allowed an
average of 92 yards per game, as the
Panthers find themselves ranked seventh
in the national polls.

But stopping the Notre Dame; ground
game has been called the key to stopping
the Irish in the past. For 19 consecutive
games, opponents have attempted to shut
down the Irish rushing attack, and 19
consecutive times the Irish have come
away unscathed. If the defending national
champions have a weakness, it is certainly
not rushing, and even with an
unspectacular passing game, defenses have
their hands full at trying to keep the ball

out of their end zone.

Rice has been compared to West.

Virginia's Major Harris, another leading
Heisman contender. Both teams run an
option game; but while Harris is at his best
when under pressure, eluding tacklers
and throwing last—second completions,
the Panthers see the two as different
entities.

“The game plan is to have Tony Rice 1

keep the ball,” said sophomore linebacker
Ricardo McDonald, whose brother Devon
is a second team defensive end for the
Irish. Despite his speed, agility and’ 535
yards on the ground, the'Panthers feel
Rice is at his most vulnerable when he is
pressured. I

But even if Rice has the Pitt defense
inside his helmet all day, Pitt Coach Mike
Gottfried believes the Irish can always
find an outlet.

“The difference in their option is it’s an
options,” said Gottfried. “They run every
option conceivable to man. They run a
trap option, a veer option, every option, a
straight down the line option. They stretch
you as much as any team ,we’ve ever
played against. They stretch you with a
good solid line and a good solid fullback
inside. i ,

“Very good running backs, tailbacks.
The skill guys outside; if you do play the
option they’ll try to hit the play action
pass,” Gottfried said. '

“But Tony Rice is the guy who is just so
productive. He just wins. It's like Al Davis
said, ‘Just win,’ and he wins. He's a very,
very good footballplayer. The cuts that he
makes on grass or turf, he'll cut on a dime.
What I've seen of Tony Rice in ballgames

is he made so many people miss because

turnover margin (+,4), the Irish
don't have to count on luck to
stop opponents. I

But the Pitt Panthers have
supplied Lou Ho1tz’s team with a
gift that will be hard to refuse: a
rash of offensive injuries,
particularly to the receiving corps.

Junior flanker Hosea Heard
missed a curfew last week, and
Pitt Coach Mike Gottfried
consequently will not allow him
to travel this weekend.
Sophomore ﬂanker Chris Bouyer
will not make the trip due to an
injury. Freshman receiver Junior
Green is hindered by a shoulder
ailment. Junior tight end Lionel
Sykes will travel but _ is still
recovering from an injury. Senior
split end and leading receiver
Henry T uten has not practiced in
pads for a week, and freshman
fullback Jimmer Bundy, just four
weeks after seeing his first playing
time of the season, has been
restrained by a gimpy ankle and

may miss the game.

“We're very concerned about
that,” said Gottfried. “Junior
Green's banged up, and Chris
Bouyer may not go. That cuts us
down in‘ numbers. But Rich
Kautter’s back; so he'll probably
travel this week. He,hasn’t done

5‘ anything as far as a game situation,

but we're real thin and that

— concerns me.”

Kautter is a walk-on from
Bloornsburg University, where he
was on scholarship. The 5-foot-
10—inch, 180-pound senior ﬂanker
was impressive in spring and fall
drills before breaking a leg at

Johnstown. The Panthers can '

hope that he returns to form, but
his time is bound to_be limited.

Still, Pitt will throw four of its
top five receivers at the Irish.
Tuten has pulled in 26 receptions
for 550 yards and four
touchdowns. Senior flanker
Reggie Williams has eight
receptions for 169 yards and one
touchdown to his credit.
Freshman split end Olanda Truitt
has five receptions for 87 yards,
and sophomore split end Baron
Jackson has four receptions for
79 yards. 5

“We still have basically our top
four receivers. We have four of
our top ﬁve going, " said Gottfried.

-But that lack of depth may
showagainst the Irish secondary,
which has 15 interceptions. Pitt
quarterback -Alex Van Pelt has
thrown five interceptions in 1989.

“They're very tough and
physical,” said Jackson of the
Irish, defensive backfield

La/eers droplin NBA ’s hierarchy as '80s fade to the '90s

By Scott Campbell .
Staff Writer

Yeah, yeah, everyone knows
that the Los Angeles Lakers were
the NBA team of the 1980s.

4 Everyone knows that they have

won ﬁve NBA titles in the decade,
reached the NBA ﬁnals for eight
of the past 10 seasons, and won

, eight straight Paciﬁc Division

titles.

But these aren't the
anymore, they’re the ’90s. Kareem
Abdul-Jabaar is gone and the
Lakers showed their age last year,
failing to win 60 games for the
first time in ﬁve years. ~

However, there hasn’t been a
team to come along and dethrone
the Lakers yet, as the Detroit
Pistons have done to the Boston
Celtics in the Eastern Conference.
This could, and should, be the
season, however, that the Holy

Laker Empire ﬁnally falls.

Pacific Division

If any team’ is capable of
knocking off the Lakers, it should
be the Phoenix Suns. Phoenix
played the Lakers tough last spring

T in the Western Conference ﬁnals,

and have probably the best talent

‘in the West. Last year, guard

Kevin Johnson came out of
nowhere to prove himself as one
of the best guards in the league.
Dan Majerle, Jeff Hornacek, Tom
Chambers and Armon Gilliam fill.
out the rest of the starting lineup

'80s B

for a team that improved its win-
loss record by 27 games last year.
They obviously can’t repeat that
success, but with the addition of
ﬁrst—round pick Kenny Battle of
Illinois, the Suns have added to
their. already deep and
experienced bench, led by last
year's Sixth-Man—of-the-Year,
Eddie Johnson.

The LA Iakers won’t really
miss Kareem’s\stats. Although he
only averaged 10 points and 4.5
rebounds per ‘game last year,
they will miss his leadership and
yearn to win. With Kareem gone,
the pressure will really be put on
Magic Johnson tohold the team
together. -And then, of course,
there is Magic’s health. He was
forced to miss the NBA Finals last
year because of a prolonged
hamstring injury and
consequently, the Lakers fell
apart. If the injury lingers, it could

- be as disastrous as was Larry

Bird’s absence from the Celtics
last season. The Lakers did pick
up a bargain in the draft, however,
nabbing Vlade Divac from the

Soviet Union. Divac should be «

able to fill Kareem’s shoes as far
as stats go, but no one can replace
his heart.

The Seattle Supersonics have
as much talent as anyone, but
never seem to be able to put it
together. Dale Ellis, Xavier
McDaniel, Derrick McK_ey,-

how can this team not be great?
Easy. Chemistry. This team has
played as a bunch of players
looking out for number one and
not caring if they win or lose.
One thing that should help is
the trade of Alton Lister to Golden
State for the Warriors’ No. 1 pick
next June. That may not seem

like it would help this year, but it _

will. Lister (mainly his wife,
believe it or not) caused a lot of
internal squabbles on the team
last year. With the addition of
Dana Barros from Boston College
and Shawn Kemp from
everywhere, the Sonics can give
theirstarters a break.

Perhaps the biggest
improvement for the Portland
Trail Blazers is not the
acquisition of Buck Williams from
NewJersey, but the hiring of Rick
Adelman to replace Mike Schuler
as coach. Under Schuler last year,
the Blazers struggled to win and
blamed the coach. Schuler even
benched Clyde Drexler last year
for what essentially was because
he didn’t care for Clyde the Glide.
Portland needs a littlemore depth,
however, to seriously contend
for anything. »

Last year Chris Mullin continued

his remarkable recovery from

alcoholism and this year he could
give the Golden State Warriors
an MVP-like year. Unfortunately,
the Warriors don’t have much

else. Sure, they have lastyear’s

Rookie-of-the-Year, Mitch
Richmond, but last year was a
down year for NBA freshman.
Sarunas Marciulionis is ﬁnally here
after leading the Soviet Union to

Summer Olympics and will
provide a long range threat, but
the -Warriors need. help down

. low. They picked up Alton Lister,

but he’s Alton Lister (see above),

and they traded away Ralph

Sampson for Jim Petersen.
Things were looking up for the

; SacramentoKings this summer:
5 they picked up Pervis Ellison as

the first pick in the college draft.

 They traded for Wayman Tisdale
~ and picked up Ralph Sampson

from Golden State. That optimism
came to —a screeching halt,
however, when second-year

. player Ricky Berry killed himself

this summer. To make matters
worse, Ellison injured himself in
a pickup game and hasn’t signed
yet. The Kings also have to deal
with the fact that they haven't

won a playoff game in nine years. .

Women's C-C places 7th
inBig East champions;
coach looks to next year *

By Jim Donlon

For the Pitt News

The Pitt women’s cross
country team traveled to New
York’s Van Cortland Park to
compete in the Big East Meet
this past Saturday. The Lady

Panthers placed seventh"

overall and sophomore Stacy
Wyzykowski managed Pitt’s
best ﬁnish with a 22nd place
overall. a

The young team composed
of five freshmen and one
sophomore ran up against
some of the best competition
in the country. Villanova is

i currently the No. 1 ranked

women’s cross country team
in the country. Providence and
Georgetown are currently No.
3 and No. 10, respectively.
“We ran pretty well
considering the competition,
but you’d always like to have
done better," commented Pitt
Coach John Vasvary, “I would
liked to have seen us place
ahead of Syracuse, but we'll
take it for experience.”
Vasvary attributed some of
the lack of experience to the
loss of last year’s No.1 runner,
Kathlene Crisos. She was Pitt’s
top ﬁnisher in the Big East
meet last season. This year,
however, she was lost for the
year when she broke her foot
prior to the season.
. “We might have done a little

according

better if she was there. We
lack the experience as a team’,
and we really don’t have a
leader to tell everyone it’s no
big deal. I think we were a
little intimidated to be there. I
know we could have run better
if they weren’t apprehensive,”
said Vasvary.

Vasvary is hoping that the
‘girls will mature enough in

the next few seasons to
become solid competitors in
the Big East. Currently, Pitt

will have at least two solid J

runners next year iniCrisos
and Wyzykowski, and
to Vasvary,
depending on how the
freshmen mature, the Lady
Panthers could become a

force to be reckoned with. A

“Some things take a lot of
time, and distance running is
one of them. It takes a lot of
work, and they don’t seem to
mind putting in the time.
Having a young team is good
and bad. It's good because
they are getting experience

' and learning now, but at the

same time they don’t have
quite enough. Hopefully in
the next fewyears, this group,
along with some more recruits,
will develop into a really solid
team,” said Vasvary.

The last meet of the season
for the women’s team will be
held on Nov. 4 against Kent
State. A

NBA

Continued from page 8
“new wave” of the NBA would be
speed and outside shooting. That
may well work for the Warriors,
but the Jazz can continue on
winning in traditional style, thank
you very much. Utah probably
has more talent than anybody in
the Midwest Division led by the
Mailman Karl Malone, who
finished second in the league in
scoring at 29 points per game.
Along with Mark Eaton, Thurl
Bailey, and the NBA’s best point
guard, John Stockton, the Jazz
have enough talent to win the
Midwest again, but that’s not
saying much. They'd probably

a finish fourth in the Pacific.

Despite not having any draft
picks this year, the Houston
Rockets improved themselves
dramatically when they signed

free agent Larry Smith from

Golden State. Houston also didn’t
lose anybody, which means they
still have Akeem Olajuwon, Otis
Thorpe, and Sleepy Floyd. The
problem with Houston is their
outside shooting. Floyd led -all
Houston Rocket guards with‘ a
.443 field goal percentage. The
Rockets will probably trade for a
gunner before the start of the
season, and if they do, they’ll pull
ahead of Utah.

A couple of years ago, the
Dallas Mavericks looked like
the team of the ’90s, but last year
all their success disappeared
because of problems off and on
the court. First, Roy Tarpley was
suspended a second time for drug
abuse. Then, James Donaldson’s
right leg literally shattered in the
middle of a game..An All—Star the
year before, Donaldson’s career
may be ﬁnished. Finally, there
was the ever—malignant Mark
Aguirre, who was finally traded
near the end of the year. That
made everyone in Dallas happy,

until the player they received,
Adrian Dantley, refused to play
for the Mavs. Dallas may have a
lot of talent, but Tarpley is one
strike away from lifetime
banishment. If he is suspended,
or even if he isn’t, the Mavericks
still have a lot of internal problems
to solve first.

The San Antonio Spurs will
either be the next Clippers or the

next Suns. With David Robinson, A

Sean Elliot and Terry Cummings

0 coming in, the Spurs have enough

new talent to A) rise from the
ashes like Phoenix did last year,
or B) sink like the Clippers did.
Veteran Maurice Cheeks was
acquired to make sure that answer
isn’t B). The starters are going to
have to produce, though, because
their bench is thinner than the
hair on Cummings’ head. This is
the year that Larry Brown and
Spuits fans have been waiting
for. If they don't produce this
year, Larry will wave bye—bye
again.

All you need to know about
the Denver Nuggets is that they
are going to rely a lot more on
Jerome Lane to produce this year.
This team is in trouble. Since
Alex English and Walter Davis
won't be around forever, the

Nuggets drafted Todd Lichti, but

Last year, the Charlotte
Hornets surprised everyone by
winning 20 games and breaking
the NBA attendance record. Last
summer, the Hornets surprised
no one by taking J.R. Reid in the
first round. Despite the outcry
that they would have received,

thing Hornet fans have to look
