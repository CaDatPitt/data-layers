Dean to Retire‘

The clean of the College of
General Studies (CGS) is retir-
ing from his position on July 1,
1983.

Dean Steele Gow, who has
been CGS dean for 12 Years, has
to retire because of the manda-
tory retirement age of 65 for all
heads of “responsibility
centers.”

Gow said he is unsure of his
plans after retirement but is
either considering going back
to teaching, taking another
administrative position within
the university or taking advan-
tage of the new early retirement
incentive plan offered by Pitt.

A search committee has been
set up by the provost’s office
and will be headed by Dr.
Donald Henderson to find a
replacement for Gow.

Bond: A New Kind

Of Social Darwinism

By BARBARA EVANS

A new kind of social
Darwinism-survival of the
richest—has been forced upon
society by the Reagan Administra-
tion, Georgia Sen. Julian Bond
said last night.

In a speech sponsored by the
Black Action’ Society, —Bond said
that United States votersdid more
than just change the name of the
occupant in the White House when
they elected Reagan in 1980.

“They began the process of the
national nullification of the needs
of the needy, the fortuitous gratifi-
cation of the gross and the gree-
dy...a pious platitude and, dare I
say it, &lf—righteous swinishness,”
Bond said.

Bond said the current adminis-
tration is trying to eliminate and
alter civil rights protections. He
said that, for the first time since
Richard Nixori was president, the
actions of the justice department
are subject to both the review of the
White House and political inter-
vention from powerful politicians.

He described a case in which the
Justice Department, at the request
of Sen. Jeremiah Denton, removed
the words “white supremacy” from
a lawsuit against white supremacy
in Mobile, Ala.

Family Violence: Epidemic

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

Family violence is reaching epi-
demic proportions and many of the
victims are young children and
infants, according to the U.S. Sur-
geon General C. Everett Koop.

He said 4,000 babies under one
week of age and 14,000 others
betwen the ages of one week and
three years are murdered each year.

' Three out of four of those victims

are murdered by their parents.
Koop, "speaking at a press confer-

ence yesterday at Western Psychiat-

ric Institute and Clinic, urged

physicians to watch for signs of

family violence.

The topic of the conference was
“Violence as a Public Health Prob-
lem,” which dealt primarily with

violence within the family
structure.

The types of violence of which
Koop spoke included violence
between children, child abuse,
spouse abuse and abuse of older
people by family members——a type
of violence that has only recently
become a public issue.

Violence is one of the major
causes of death in the country, and
Koop said he suspects that there are
twice as many cases of child abuse
than those reported. ,

“(Child abuse) is a dirty little
secret people keep to themselves
and don't talk about,” he said.

Koop attributes this intrafamily
violence to three main factors: vio-
lence on television, video games
and the poor economic situation

“Americans love tragedy,” he
said. He believes that children
today are getting saturated with
violence from the media.

“Even if you said to your child,‘

9

‘Don’t watch that show, ifyoujust
watch the news, you’lf get a fair
exposure to violence,” he said.

He also believes that video games
are influential in cases of violence
within a family because they stim-
ulate a lot of tension in players
who, for the most part, are
children.

“They are into it body and soul,”
he said. “Everything is Zapping the
enemy.”

“Children get to the point
where, when they see another child

The allocations committee
believes that some departing
student government board
members want a “last fling"
and are trying to send too many
students to a university
conference.

The conflict over attendance
at the conference surfaced at an
SGB meeting last week when
the board rejected the Alloca-
tions Committee’s recommen-
dation that only five students
attend the conference, instead of
10, as the board originally
requested.

The American Association of
University Students is sponsor-
ing the conference, which will
be held Nov. 19 to Nov. 22nd in

Board Taking A Last Fling?  

Princeton, N.J. The student's
expenses would be paid for by
student activity fee revenue.
Board member Linda Haus-
man said she recommended that
10 students from various stu-
dent organizations attend the
conference because of the large
number of Pitt organizations
that she said would benefit from
it. Columbia University is hold-
ing a workshop specifically for
Pitt’s Commuter Affairs Com-
mittee, and Hausman said that
the University of Pennsylvania
will be conducting a workshop
that would benefit the board's
Academic Affairs Committee.
Allocations committee
member Cathie Marucci, speak-
ing for the committee, said that
“ten people are a lot to send,

and we think that five are all
that is necessary.” According to
Marucci, allocations recom-
mended housing students in
local dorms for the conference,
but the board wants to “put
them up in hotels."

Although Hausman is citing
the organization of an Ameri-
can Association of University
Students chapter at Pitt as a rea-
son for attending the confer-
ence, Marucci said that
Hausman, as a departing SGB
member, would have little
opportunity to do so.

According to Student
Government Board president
Todd DeLuca, the board and
Allocations Committee dis-
agreement centers around the

“To the president and the attor-
ney general, the Constitution is a
document of almost infinite elas-
ticity to be cut and snipped to fit
the fashions of the moment,” Bond
said.

The Reagan administration is
also reversing progress previously
made in economic and’ foreign
affairs, Bond said. ‘

“The administration proposes
to let the market system regulate
full and fair employment," Bond
said. “The last time the market
guaranteed full employment for
black people was 100 years ago. It
was called slavery then.”

Concerning foreign affairs,
Bond said the U.S. continues to
“mislearn” the lessons of Vietnam
and Cambodia, as demonstrated by
its involvement in El Salvador.

He added“ that the Reagan
administration, both at home and
abroad, “has surrendered the gen-
eral good to the corporate will.
They tend to radically alter the
relationship. between America and
Africa to substitute mineral rights
for human rights.”

Bond said that to bring about
changes, resources that now
remain untapped must be used. He
cited the power of the ballot box as
the most undeveloped resource, in

Artist

Concerned
About
Labeﬁng

By BARBARA EVANS

Labeling American artists as
radical, militant or extreme alien-
ates them from their audiences and
reduces exposure to their ideas,
musician Gil-Scott-Heron said last
night. . ‘

His speech was part of the Black R

Action Society's 13th Annual Black
Week. P

Heron, who is also a poet and
published author, said he's had
problems with people labeling his
music. He often finds his albums
listed under “miscellaneous" in
record stores, he said.

In addition, Heron said he is
questioned about the subject of his
songs, which deal with unfair
housing, toxic wastes, and nuclear
power.

“A lot of folks, when we first
started to do a song about the threat

‘ of nuclear power, would come up

to me and say, ‘Why are you doing
a song about that? That’s not a
Black issue.’ And I’d say, ‘you’re
right about that because nuclear
power is an equal opportunity des-
troyer. Nuclear power has proven
itself to be one of the most destruc-
tive forces on the planet,” Heron
said.

Heron explained that if people
want to bring about change, pro-
test is not necessarily’ an answer.

“There is a difference between
protesting and trying to make sug-
gestions, even if they are from a
minority’s point of view," Heron
said. He explained that protesters
are “on the outside, trying to get on
the inside of an issue.”

black America. According to Bond,
only 55 percent of eligible blacks
voted in the past elections. The per-
centage of voters in the 18-25 age
groups was even lower, he said.

“Registration and participation
in the voting process among young
black people is lower than any
other group of any democracy on
the face of the earth.”

Blacks, women and other minor-
ities “mistakenly believe them-
selves incapable of influencing
society," Bond said. He explained
that blacks have more economic

power than they believe and that
they must “break down the barri-
cades of apathy and indifference in
order to stimulate changes.
' “You have to say no to self-
imposed political impotence,”
Bond said. He noted that in 1980,
membership in the Ku Klux Klan
increased’, while membership in
groups dedicated to improving the
status of various racial and eco-
nomic groups remained constant.

“People dedicated to your death
and destruction are gaining in
power," Bond said. “Aren't you
going to do the same?”

correct policy for requesting
money.

“There are two ways that we
could have applied -for addi-
tional funding,” DeLuca said.
“SGB could have made an
emergency request for funds on
behalf of all the groups who
would send representatives to
the conference, or each group
could have requested the emer-
gency funds separately.

“We thought it would be bet-
ter to make one emergency

SGB Fling

request rather than several.
Allocations thought that it was
against policy to make one
request for so many groups.”

The l()—member delegation
the board wants to send consists
of two members of the Black
Action Society, Commuter
Affairs Committee members,
two current Student Govern-
ment board members, two
board mernbers-elect, one
member from the Inter-
Honorary council and one from
the Academic Affairs Com-
mittee.

Labeling Concern

continued from page one

Taxpayers, however, are contrib-
utors and investors in society as a
whole, he said.

“If you are an investor, you are
not outside. You are on the inside,
trying to direct what happens with
your money,” Heron said.

Heron also offered comments on
a variety of issues ranging from
education to Black history.

“We, as members of our com-
munity, should know a little better
how to encourage our teachers,”
Heron said. “We have to encourage
our children not to get discouraged
if they don’t immediately pick up
on their reading and writing jive.

“Getting together how you
listen and how you speak, these are
the most important things. You are

going to have to do that whether
you can read or write anywayf’

According to Heron, Black his-
tory has been misinterpreted
because “ours is an oral tradition.
If you only have onehistorian who
is responsible for the history, then
you get only one story about what
went down."

He also said that equality is not
achieved through writing laws.

“All men are created equal. You
don’t have to make up any more
laws to make all men equal. You
just have to live up to the one, that
was written first. It doesn’t matter
how many times you write it down,
if you're not going to live it.”

Heron was joined onstage after
the lecture by percussionist Larry
McDonald.

. they just sit back. Kids are tremen-

dous mimicks.

Supporting Koop’s view is the
fact that in 1976 there were approx-
imately 30 children who became
paraplegic. In each case, it was the
result of trying to copy motorcycle

stunts.‘ _ _
Koop said that tensions pro-

duced by the economic situation
are also responsible for violence
within the family.

“In times of economic distress,
there is a higher incidence ofichild

abuse and spouse abuse,” he said. '

While it is not possible to stop all

‘violence, Koop said each person

can learn more about certain
situations-—such as child abuse.

Family Violence: Epidemic?

Koop also believes that people in
the “caring” professions should
learn to recognize violent behavior
before it becomes manifest in overt
action.

For example, the child who tries
to commit homocide has often pre-
viously tried to [commit suicide.
Such behavior should be detected
and preventive measures should be
taken by professionals, Koop said.

The university is expected to
break ground for a new frater-
nity housing complex by
December, director of student
activities Andy Smith said yes-
terday.

Pitt's proposal to build eight
on-campus fraternity houses
received a setback at an Oct. 26
city planning commission
meeting. Commission members
decided to require written guar-
antees from Pitt that current
fraternity houses on Bayard and
Bellefield Streets would not be
re-sold to other fraternities.

Smith said the commissions

requirement was “no big deal.”

He added “We've always had an .

understanding that would be
the case. We just formalized
that.”

The construction of the fra-
ternity houses, which will be
located on University Drive C
and Allequippa Street, was
expected to start in October.
Smith said the university hoped
to break ground then, but was
prevented by weather condi-
tions. He added he expects
extensive work on the buildings
to begin before the first of next
year.

Assessing The Reactions To A Major Loss-

By MICHAEL ROKNICK

In Saturday’s football game
between Notre Dame and Pitt,
there were actually three teams
in the stadium—Notre Dame,
Pitt and the fans. Although the
latter did not play on the field,
its off-field activities served as a
foundation for the play of the
rest of the football game and
helped dictate the reaction of
the losing Pitt players.

The fact that the Panthers
lost to the Fighting Irish by a
score of 31-16 was not the direct
result of the fans, but they were
a factor . Before the first play,
the Panthers were expected to
win by at least a 10-point mar-
gin.

To say that this high expecta-
tion for a Panther win was a

direct cause of their losing
would.be unfair; it would be
equally unfair to say that the
high expectations had no effect
at all.

The pressures that plague
college football players can be
readily seen in the number of
hours that the average player
spends in training. The min-
imum time spent per player on
major college teams hovers at
about 30 hours a week. Some
players train for more than 50
hours a week. This time fac-
tor will almost certainly have
an impact. .

The lack of education among
college players has caused con-
troversy in college sports. It is
estimated that 2 percent of all
college athletes go on to the
pros. The remaining 98 percent
must try to find places in the
job market.

The alumni, students,
faculty and coaches have placed
the emphasis in sports on win-
ning. This has led to the whole-
sale hiring and firing of
coaches and abuses of recruit-
ing procedures for high school
athletes.

Fortunately, Pitt has so far
avoided these practices, but the
importance placed on winning
a national championship could
lead to such problems. It is a
fact that Pitt has probably lost
its chance for a national
championship.

In talking "to some of the fans
after the game, it was quite
apparent that most expected
the Panthers to win both the
game and the national cham-
pionship. Indeed, most sports
polls predicted the Panthers
would win the national title
before the season started.

The reaction of the students
during the game was one of dis-
belief. One student said that he
even stopped drinking to make
sure that he wasn't hallucinat-
ing. The major response was
one of despair.

“I thought they let down
after the half,” said one student.
“It seemed as if they didn’t care
what they did after Notre Dame
took the lead.”

There were others in the sta-
dium with different thoughts
about the game. One older fan
thought poor coaching was a
cause of the Panthers’ loss.

“I sat out there and almost
froze while Fazio screwed up
the whole game,” he said.

The previous decade of foot-
ball coaching at Pitt has been
calm compared to that of other
schools. Johnny» Majors was
hired to bring the Panthers out

ofa slump. In 1976, the Panth-
ers won their first national
championship since 1937.
Majors, however, decided that
he would rather coach football
in Tennessee, and Jackie Sher-
rill was hired.

Sherrill came to Pitt with the
hopes of repeating the perfor-
mance of his predecessor. He
came close, but instead, he
opted for a multi-million dol-
lar contract at -Texas A&M,
making him the highest paid
college administrator in the
country.

Defensive coordinator Sera-
fino F azio was given the nod to
coach the Panthers. The results
of his first season are,imcom-
plete, but there is already pres-
sure upon him as a result of the
loss to Notre Dame.

Annual
Circus

The annual circus has passed: another Student
Government Board (SGB) election campaign ended
last week.

This year, many voices were raised against candi-
dates’ papering the campus with posters, and one
candidate withdrew from the race amid allegations
of jeopardizing the fairness of the election. It would
be easy now, in the wake of these alleged misdeeds, to
call for more strict enforcement of the Student
Government Election Code, which regulates SGB
campaigns and elections.

The Election Code, together with policies of the
university's registrar and the Office of Residence
Life, specifies where posters and banners may and
may not be placed. More careful enforcement of
these regulations by the Student Government Elec-
tions Committee (SGEC) would reduce the number

. of posters. cluttering classrooms and hallways and
could help to makeour campus a more pleasant
place to study or to visit during campaigns.

The Election Code also governs the operation of
polling places on voting days, and more careful
adherence to these policies is needed for the elimina-
tion of improper campaigning at the polls and the
prevention of tampering with the ballots. In general,
since the code is intended to insure that elections will
be fair and democratic, we should certainly expect
that it will be enforced. Without enforcement, the
code is meaningless.

Strict adherence to the existing regulations, how-
ever, would only be a step in the right direction. The
SGEC must seriously re-evaluate the Election Code
itself. For instance, enforcement of the code as it
stands could reduce the clutter of -posters in class-
rooms but serious thought must be given to remov-
ing political posters from the classroom altogether.
The classroom, after all, is not the proper place for
the petty games of political one-up-manship that
recent campaigns seem to "have become.

Then, the SGEC should consider bringing candi-
date spending limits into line with such a new and
more appropriate posting policy. If extravagant
posting practices are curtailed, candidates would no
doubt need less money to run their campaigns. This
measure would have the added benefit of making an
SGB candidacy less expensive and—therefore—
within the reach of more students.

An appropriate Election Code would recognize
and protect the right that all of us in the university
community have to expect that campaigns will be
fair and democratic, and that their conduct will not
disrupt other important aspects of university life.
Careful enforcement is necessary to make the Elec-
tion Code a meaningful document. The Elections
Committee must make sure that it is an appropriate
one.

Waiting For A Good War

By scorr REX

I can't believe an American
adviser in El Salvador has said,
“All I want to do is win one war,
that’s all, just one, it’ll be like win-
ning the World Series for me.” I
guess I've been encircled by univer-
sity walls too long.

There was a time in my life when
I heard these typical “I can't wait
for a good war" statements daily.
After a while they seemed to lose
some effect, but not always.

I used to be in the Marines. When
Captain Court assumed command
of our company, he marched the
thousand of us about a mile away
from our barracks. With a massive
oak walking stick to swing for
emphasis, he began a lecture on the
Fall of the Roman Empire. To
make a long story short, he let it be
known that his troops would not
be unfit for battle.

“The survival of American
democracy depends on us," he
would scream, with his stick hit-
ting the ground. We thought he
was a little off-balance, although
we never questioned his authority.

“Good war” statements are
sometimes kept at just that by Con-
gress. At the Marine Corps ball in
Toronto, Italy, 1976, our captain
made a toast for the hopeful begin-

Seﬁous

Dear Editor:

While Peggy Ferri’s friends may
bemoan the fact that she’s growing
too serious and cynical for her age,
they are nonetheless overlooking
her most obvious quality: she’s an
idiot. A

It’s been a long time since I've
been exposed to such a ludicrous
piece of dribble as her column
“And Who Loses More." To hear
Peggy tell the story, America's bud-
ding young artistic community as a
whole has deserted their true call-
ings in life in pursuit of the
“Almighty Buck." Let’s face it,
Peggy, your friends chose to leave
their dream fields because they
didn't have the guts to take a risk.
Did you ever stop to think about
how seriously these people consid-
ered their chances to be in the first
place? Perhaps they knew them-
selves and their abilities too well
and knew that they couldn't cut it
in such competitive fields. If so,
so much for all of that lost poten-
tial.

Furthermore, your suggestion

that there's no money in the liberal

ning of a new war. Our captain
wanted to wage this war in Angola.
His logic? Since Cuban troops were
fighting it was all right for us to
have a little fun. I had never seen a
man so excited about the possibil-
ity of death. Me, I was 19, scared
and had no idea where Angola was.

‘The survival of
American democracy
depends on us,” he would
scream, with his stick
hitting the ground. We
thought he was a little off-
balance, although we
never questioned his
authority.’

Years later, I wonder if our cap-
tain knows anything about Gulf
Oil's subsidizing of the communist
government of Angola. More
importantly, I wonder what it was
like to be 19, scared and not having
a clue as to the location of South
Vietnam. After reading “Dis-
patches” and seeing “The Deer
Hunter,” I feel extremely lucky
that the Vietnam war ended when
it did.

College students best remember
that they will not be exempt from

the next draft. Once the United
States decides to become militarily
involved, students will not be able
to afford to protest. In the '60s, stu-
dents could protest for a few years
without worrying about being
drafted.

When the next draft begins, stu-
dents will have three basic options:
pack your trash for bootcamp,’ pack
your trash for Canada or pack your
trash for your jail cell. Being a col-
lege student will not protect you.

In 1954, the United States began
to aid the Diem regime in South
Vietnam. By 1960, we had 15,000
advisers “in-country.” By 1965, we
had begun , direct military
involvement.

Our military aid is increased to
El Salvador yearly. It is not just a
liberal cliche to say that the mis-
takes of Vietnam are once again
manifesting themselves in U.S.
policy towards El Salvador. There
are plenty of people in the defense
department who want to win just
one-war. '

College students might think’

Congress will never go along with
sending, “our boys” into combat.
We should remember that all we
need is one Gulf of Tonkin inci-
dent to justify the drafting of 19-
year-olds. If I were 19 and had no
idea of where El Salvador was, I
would start searching for a map.

Or Ludicrous?

arts careers is totally unfounded.
One need only look at the meg-
abucks they're shelling out for such
gemsas “Joanie Loves Chachi" on
TV to see that this is not true. Sure,
there's not enough money to please

 

everyone, but what field do you
know of where this is not true?
Most of all. I resent your com-
ments about all of those computer
science “lookalikes", who could be
the “innovative thinkers and crea-
tors for the next generation."

Where in the hell is it written that
artists have a monopoly on creativ-
ity and thinking? Where do you
think a scientist gets his ideas
from? From the elves?

I find it so ironical that the night
before your trash letter appeared,‘
“60 Minutes" interviewed one of
those mindless computer scientists.
How sad that all he could think up
was a device to help paraplegics
walk again. Why, if he would have
had any creativity at all, he would
have made them fly. Oh well, what
can you expect from another cog in
the old machine, eh?

Finally, I would like to point out
that the next generation of individ-
uals may be seriously deficient of
thinkers, inventors and artists as
you say. However, we can at least
be optimistic that individuals lack-
ing such qualities will not go
unemployed. They can always find
jobs at The Pitt News.

The Rising Price Of Fame

Dear Editor:

As an avid reader of Christina
Clinton and a close follower of her
ongoing tribulations, I feel com-
pelled to write to you with my com-
ments. I feel that Ms. Clinton
consistently writes articles which
display misinformation, ignorance

713"and contradictions. I tend to ques-

tion why you continue to publish
these sorts of columns in your
paper. In particular, I really ques-
tion your choice to publish her
latest article, ‘Even Fame Has its
Price’. I don’t want for this letter to
appear as another picky outlash at
Ms. Clinton and her views. Rather,
I would like to express to you my
disappointment with her overall
journalistic qualities and her abuse
of The Pitt News as an outlet for
her personal gripes.

To begin with, I would like to

‘comment on her constant mis-

reporting of facts. I’m sure almost
everyone is aware of the several
mistakes which were made in her
article on sexism. She misinter-
preted many lyrics and songs and
the readers were quick to let her
know about the mistakes. But it did
not stop there. In her ‘apology’,
and I hesitate to use that word, she
still continues to mix up the facts.
Despite the fact that many people
wrote to correct her about the
author of the song ‘Athena’, she
couldn’t get it straight. In her apol-
ogy she states, “so...Pete Townsend
writes and sings the song...”. He
wrote the song, but no one said he
sang it. Perhaps a third article on
the subject and she might be able to
get just that one small fact cor-
rected. But forgetting about that
condemned ‘sexist’ episode, Clin-
ton continues on the same track in
her S.G.B. article. It is beyond me
why she stressed the fact that there
is a draft in the U.S. I knew there
was draft registration, but I was
never aware that a draft law, had
been enacted. Perhaps because it
wasn’t.

Dear Editor:

Tom Wanko’s defeat in the
recent Student Government Board
elections was neither surprising
nor mysterious to me after I fin-
ished reading his column, “Turn-

ing Back Progress” (Pitt News,‘

Nov. 5, 1982). It is an excellent
example of the sort of conclusions
at which an individual arrives
when he cannot “detect when a
man is talking rot.”

Wanko begins by stating that
“The concept of education as the
great equalizer is being abandoned
throughout America...” If this is
true, it is because people realize
that education alone will not make
them “equal”; in theory, we are all

equal under the law, but we are ‘
‘ most certainly not equal in terms of

ability, intelligence, ambition or
creativity and sending everyone to
college, no matter how cheaply,
will not change that one bit.

People beco’rne successful
through a variety of means, with a
great idea and the determination to
see it through being a typical com-
bination. Formal educaiton has lit-
tle to _do with either of these.
Wanko continues his first para-
graph by accusing President Rea-
gan, Governor Thornburg, and
Chancellor Posvar of deliberately
enacting programs that will make
it harder for middle and lower
income students to get the educa-
tion which will supposedly substi-
tute for, rather than supplement,
the personal traits mentioned
above.

Nowhere in his column does
Wanko offer any convincing evi-
dence that a'desire “to turn the

I realize that these are small criti-
cisms, but they add to my point.

-How can readers be expected to

take these articles seriously when
she continues to report these small
erroneous facts? As a feminist, I
was insulted to have this misin-
formed reporter represent an
important feminist issue in the way
in which she did. With a reporter
like Ms. Clinton writing for femi-
nists, who needs enemies like Phyl-
lis Schlafly working against us?
Ms. Clinton seemed to turn enough
readers against the issue by simply
misreporting the facts. Ms. Clinton
believes that people were missing
the point of her article. Perhaps it
was Ms. Clinton who’s missing the

‘With a reporter like Ms.

Clinton writing for
feminists, who needs
enemies like Phyllis

Schlafly working against
us?’ ‘

- {1-
point. The misrepresentation of
any facts in a published article only
serves to take away from that arti-
cle’s credibility.

It is behind these arguments that
I criticize The Pitt News in its deci-
sion to publish these articles. I
believe also that The Pitt News is
wrong for continuing to allow Ms.
Clinton to use the paper as her per- i
sonal ‘speak-out’ column. First it
was her apology which was in all
reality a joke. There are no excuses
for the mistakeswhich were made.
The most ridiculous thing I ever
read was this journalist writing,
“yea...but...” in response to her
mistakes. Ms. Clinton destroyed
the credibility of her article when
she failed to check her facts respon-
sibly. No excuses areneeded, only a
correction.

The final straw was her latest
article, “Even Fame Has its Price.”
I always believed that the opinion
page was a responsible outlet, used
to air responsible views, by respon-

clock back on social progress” is
what motivates Reagan, Thorn-
burg, and Posvar. What they do
have is different ideas on how to
achieve progress and they have the
right to do so——something which
the Free Lunch crowd has never
understood nor respected. They

also have a responsibility to the’

taxpayers to make it harder for stu-
dents to default on their student
loans, and as a taxpayer,‘ I’m glad
they are doing this.

It is true that Reagan has
“failed” to keep PELL’s budget up
with inflation, but Wanko fails to
mention that Reagan has brought
inflation down—-a far more diffi-
cult task.

I’ll grant you that Reagan is not
the Great Messiah whom so many
think that a president should be-
what human being could be? But
have you so quickly forgotten. the
Carter disaster? If you are also a
conspiracy theory fan, read Holly
Sklar’s Trilateralism and find out
about some of your favorite
liberals!

At the risk of dignifying a
remark so ridiculous that it doesn’t
deserve an answer, not all of the
money raised in tuition hikes goes
into Wesley Posvar’s pocket.
Although it is true that tuition has
gone up nearly every year for over
oa decade, Reaganomics has been
in effect only since October of last
year, so don’t blame Reagan. Don’t
blame Thornburg, for that matter;
he's only been in office for four
years. (If you remember his prede-
cessor, Milton Shapp, or his oppo-
nent in 1978, Pete Flaherty, then
you know that Democrats are not

always such great friends of higher

. ti_on Bell,
emphasis on education for technol-

sible people. If Ms. Clinton wishes
to write an article on the,cost_s_ of
fame, then she should do it in a
responsible way. Instead, this latest
article was an abusive attempt to
air her personal gripes, boast her
popularity, and to name drop.
(“...about ten guys walked right
up...You're Chris Clinton aren’t
you?...”) To Ms. Clinton I say,
since you’re a reporter for a news-
paper and not a television news
program, there is no reason why
your dissatisfied readers would rec-
ognize you in a bar. Obviously,
you’re having problems with a few
of your own aquaintances over
issues in your articles. The opinion
pages of The Pitt News is not the
proper place to respond to these
attacks on you. As a responsible
journalist you have an obligation
not to abuse the newspaper in this
way, as well as an obligation not to
insult the readers of the paper with
your personal, and rather unim-
portant problems. And inciden-
tally Ms. Clinton, just why should
these people who bother you have
their L.C.B.s revoked? I didn't
know that you had to qualify as a
“responsible adult” to get the card.
I only thought you had to be a
twenty-one-year-old state resident.
In conclusion, I believe that Ms.
Clinton hit the nail on the head
when she stated, “...come on, I’m
not Patti Burns or Barbara Wal-
ters.” Nothing could be more true
than that. I’d say that Ms. Clinton
fashions herself more after Miss
Emily Littella, of Saturday Night
Live fame. I would hereby ask and
request that Ms. Clinton cease with
her irresponsible journalism, and
instead deliver to the readers the
type of articles which deserve to be
published in a newspaper. In clos-
ing, I would also ask for The Pitt
News to use more discretion when
publishing articles. If not, you’ll
only continue to insult your read-
ers, as well as further discredit The

Pitt News.

learning, either.) The cost of nearly
everything began rising long
before Reagan stopped making
Borax Soap commercials, and no
one person, party, or ideology
deserves the blame for the fact that
this includes running a university.

‘I’ll grant you that Reagan
is not the Great Messiah
whom so many think that j
a president should be-
what human being could
be?”

Wanko then turns to Thomas
Jefferson for an inspiring quote
concerning the relationship
between the rulers and the ruled.
It’s»a beautiful quote, and one of
my favorites, so pardon me for
repeating it: “Every government
degenerates when trusted to the
rulers of the people alone. The peo-
ple themselves, therefore, are its
only safe depositories. And to
render them safe, their minds must
be improved to a certain degree.”
In the paragraph which follows
this quote, Wanko sings some
rightly-deserved praise to our
country’s two hundred year effort
toward this end, and he is not exag-
gerating when he states that most
of our greatest advances have taken
place since World War II. But then
one reads "on and discovers that
Wanko lauds only the social side of
progress while having little inter-
est, apparently, in the technologi-
cal advances which make social
progress possible. Hence his dis-
pleasure with Secretary of Educa-

Dear Editor:

Who is Peggy Ferri and how
did she get to be so creative?

Is her tirade “And Who Loses
More” The Pitt News (Nov. 8)
the essence of her burgeoning
creativity, sprung from her sup-
supposedly superior liberal arts
education? If so, may her brand
of creativity perish. Ferri appar-
ently has never heard of scien-
tific creativity. Perhaps she
thinks scientific expression
makes one another “cog in the
machine.” For enlightenment,

An Elitist Tirade

she could befriend a few scien-
tists and engineers. Obviously
she has never done this.

I must also point out that Fer-
ri’s reference to “computer
science major look-alikes” is a
bit of hurtful slander a true
humanist would not have
inflicted. Ms. Ferri should con-
sider carefully the consequences
of elitism. She will never pro-
duce any meaningful art while
in her current condition.

Face The Facts !

Dear Editor:

In reference to Peggy Ferri’s
column on November 8, I’d like to
play the Devil's advocate. I think I
can tell you who will lose more if
everyone dropped what they were
doing to write children’s stories or
went into government work.
Society will lose.

When are the liberal arts people
going to wake up and face the fact

that progress will stagnate if engi- -

neering, science and business
majors don’t increase steadily over
the next decades. Who is going to
create new jobs (useful jobs) with-
out people to design better ways of

i producing? The fact that liberal

arts majors don’t get good jobs is
also a fallacy.

Major automobile manufactur-
ers of the world are literally on
their knees begging for design
majors from colleges and grad
schools to come make their cars
more aerodynamically sound and
aesthetic looking. To cite exam-

ogy. Bell's remarks are not, as
Wanko charges, undemocratic.
They are quite realistic. This
planet’s resources are dwindling
and the continued rise in the
world's population will only
insure increasingly fierce competi-
tion over them. Wanko does not
seem to realize that technological
advances create jobs and wealth
and that industrializaion lowers
birth rates. (If he does know this, he
does not say so in his column.) If
we are to find a practical energy
source for this industrialization

(environmentally safe and capable‘

of supporting over six billion peo-
ple), we must educate people along
the lines that Bell suggests.
Instead of realizing this, Wanko
misses the point completely and
again invokes Thomas Jefferson to
criticize someone who disagrees
with him. (Personally, I think Jef-
ferson would either be amused or
puzzled to find that a socialist
would appeal to a philosopher
who was popular with conserva-
tives and libertarians in order to
blast away at the social class of
which Jefferson was a member!)
In his next to last paragraph,
Wanko makes his most (inadver-
tantly, I’m sure) insulting state-

ment of all: “Without programs to

assure the opportunity to attend
schools, you may be the last genera-
tion with the ability t recognize the
rot that is spewing forth form the
Reagans, Thornburgs, and P05-
vars." There are plenty of ways to
finance your education without
borrowing money which the
government legally extracted from
wage earners with families to feed
and coming from a low-income or

ples, the 1982 Camaro and Firebird

Also, who is going to help our
great leaders in Washington (lib-
eral arts majors and lawyers) turn

The Inside Story :-

Authorities Say   -

Drugs Not A

Problem At Pitt

“It would be naive to say there
aren’t people using controlled sub-
stances on campus, but I do not
believe it is a large number, nor have
I seen evidence that those who do
use them cause significant problems
to those who do not,” said James
Watters, assistant directorof the
department of public safety at Pitt.

Watters is not alone in his belief
that there is not a visibly disturbing
amount of drug usage on the Pitt
campus.

In his two years of acting as a
resident assistant in the Towers,
Gregory O’Griffith reports that he
has never encountered a drug-
related problem on his floor.

“The only drug that l’ve seen has
been alcohol,” O’Griffith said. He

Jim Watters

also said alcohol has posed a larger

"problem than marijuana and hard

drugs.

Although the days of conspicuous
drug usage connected with the
atmosphere of the 19605 are over,
drug usage on college campuses
remains a subject in the public eye.
Statistics indicate, however, that
there is not a significantly wides-
pread drug problem at Pitt.

Last year, the drug-related inci-
dents in which "campus police
became involved were 52 marijuana
cases and three incidents involving
“hard” drugs (speed, downers,
cocaine, heroin, ect.).

From the beginning of 1982 to the
end of last month, there were 26
incidents involving marijuana pos-
session and eight involving hard
drugs. The campus police have

been involved in one incident con-
cerning the sale of hard drugs so far

,‘ ‘.;7,,‘’’_\ ‘f v‘.(.i_.“,

In October of 1982, the campus
police made 10 drug—related arrests.
three of which were made last week

for heroin possession. ~

. The incidents of arrests have had
a steady decrease in the past several
years, but, according to Watters,
these numbers are too small to
reflect a trend in the university.

About 80 percent of the arrests
involving drugs are people who
aren’t affiliated with the university.
They, come onto the campus
grounds, Watters said, and are
often the ones who_possess the
“hard drugs.”

The vast majority of arrests that
the campus police make involve
small quantities of drugs for per-

Houston Photo

sonal consumption—generally
marijuana and hashish.

Pennsylvania laws provide police
officers with a lot of freedom to use
their own discretion when dealing
with drug-related cases.

“To have any amount of mari-
Juana or whatever is legally against
the law,” Watters said. “But as a
practical matter, the courts cer-
tainly couldn t handle all of the small
possession cases that the officers
could bring before the court.

“Officers have a legal responsibil-
ity to seize and destroy the contra-
band, but often times, that means
that they have the user himself
dump the small quanitity right there
at the scene, or they can seize it and
we as a department get a court
order which gives us the right to
destroy the contraband,” he said.

Once, those officers would
charge somebody with small,pos-

 s€ssi9n,’.{.Watters said.‘.‘.‘T.hey’re not

there to provide other services to
the community.

“In consideration of your resour-
ces, it becomes more beneficial for
the community at large for the
officer to handle those cases right
then and there,” said Watters.

Marijuana-related incidents are
usually disposed ofat the Ptellml‘
nary hearing and handled by fines of
up to $300 and court costs.

Larger amounts of marijuana or
some other type of narcotic can be
taken as far as criminal court, but
this usually doesn’t occur; when an
arrest occurs, most cases are
handled at the magistrate’s level.

It is policy that a student arrested
by campus police must also face
proceedings by the Student Judicial
Board. ‘

‘As a practical mat-
ter, the courts cer-
tainly couldn’t
handle all of the
small possession
cases that the offi-
cers could bring
before the court.’

Tom Campbell, coordinator of
the student judicial system, finds
cases the Judicial Board handles
involving drugs are fewer than those
involving alcohol. When a case does
reach the J. Board level, however,
the first step is to send out an initial
notice requesting the student to
meet with representatives from the
board to discuss the problem.

Also, the complaining party will
issue a sanction. At this point, the
student decides whether to settle
the sanction or appear before the

board. Campbell finds that students
settle without appearing before the
board most of the time.

“Many times, students don’t want
to be designated as a user of drugs
or caught selling drugs,” he said.

“If a student was caught using
drugs, the board would probably
opt for something like a rehabilita-
tion center for them and, possibly,
expulsion from the residence halls
or even the university,” he said.

Campbell recalls a few years ago
when he was working at Pitt as an

advocate, someone was caught sell-
ing drugs and was expelled from the
university.

In the case that this situation
would reoccur, Campbell says that
“the most reasonable assumption”
is that expulsion would be the pun-
ishment again.

Not all incidents involving drugs
in the resident halls result in Judicial
Board hearings. The members of
the Office of Residence Life must go
through the proper channels before
they reach the Judicial Board stage.

“The RA. monitors the situa-
tion,” said Brenda Zagorac, assist-
ant director of the Office of Resi-
dence Life, “and if the activities
continue, they can take it to the resi-
dent director, who will review the
situation and take appropriate
action.”

“Appropriate action” varies from
case to case. Sometimes, it means
referring a student to the counsel-
ling center, while at other times, it
means going as far as pressing
charges with the Judicial Board.

“If push comes to shove,” O’Grif-
fith said, “we’ll contact outside
authorities.”

The department of public safety
on campus has an educational sec-
tion in which officers visit some local
high schools to advise younger stu-
dents about the various laws con-
cerning drugs, the types of penalties,
people can face and the detrimental
effects of drug usage in an effort to
prevent future drug problems.

'Trend In
Increased Drug

Use Slowing Down

It appears that drug use is begin-
ning to moderate due to public edu-

, cation programs about drugs.

Jean Koesel, assistant director of
the Counselling Center, explained
that she can observe first hand only
those students who come in for
counselling, and, in her experience,
the number of students seeking help
for drugs and alcohol problems is
not very high.

“Alcohol seems to be the main
problem,” she said, “and we can
work only with students that want
help. Now, this doesn’t mean that
there is or is not a problem if they
don’t know the symptoms. Students
may not be identifying themselves
with an alcohol problem.”

The hard drugs, she explained,
seem to have lost popularity due to
the drug education programs being
conducted in public schools. She
said it is difficult to see a problem
campus wide.

Bob “LaCivita of the Wellness
Resource Center echoed her opin-

‘There has been
a sharp rise in the
use of stimulants in
both recreational
and non-recrea-
tional use.’

ieas by saying that it becomes a
‘question of responsibility and irres-
ponsibility.

“We don’t tell students to
abstain,” he said. “They don’t want
to hear that, but when it starts inter-
fering with their studies, physical
health or personal relationships,
then yes, it is a problem, and they
need to seek some help.”

He went on to say that students
need to be able to discern when they
have a problem——they need to know
the symptoms.

LaCivita said people are begin-
ning to understand that addiction to
drugs or alcohol is not a rosy pic-
ture, and this understanding has led
to a demise in the use of hard drugs.
He cited the tragedy of Art Linklet-
ter, who used to host a children’s
show on CBS. His daughter com-
mitted suicide while on an LSD trip.
“And Timothy Leary’s kicks,” he
said, “provided nothing but a dead
end.”

-Jean-Koese1,l »  

ow‘ "'x:_'

  

LaCivita said a study done at the
University of Maryland from 1971-
75 showed that the use of hallucino-
gens, barbiturates and ampheta-
mines has decreased. He also said a
1977 random sample study done at
Pitt showed university students
know the effects of alcohol on their
bodies. However, he declined to

release results of the study on the .

grounds that they might be

misinterpreted.

“Pitt students are as responsible
with their alcohol as any seg.mer,i,t of
the American adult population, he
said.

Koesel said that drug awareness

is evident on campus, as shown by
the vice-chancellor’s formation of a

ob L'aCivita

‘ task force. She and LaCivita served

on the panel during the 1977 study.

Patrick O’Malley, a social psy-
chologist at the University of Michi-
gan’s Institute for Social Research,
said that, on a national level, drug
use is moderating slightly. He con-
ducted a study with two of his col-
leagues, Lloyd Johnston and Jerald

Bachman, also from the University ‘

of Michigan, using the high school
graduating class of 1981. The sam-
ple wastaken from 17,000 seniors
nationwide from 130 public and pri-
vate high schools. Results showed

«r if <1  -2 7‘lIﬁ1lsI-’r"in'phﬁtn 

that the use of illicit drugs in high
schools is also beginning to
moderate.

“This doesn’t mean that the drug
problem is far from being over in any
way, said O’Malley. “Contrary to
the moderations of most classes of
drugs, therehas been a sharp rise in
the use of stimulants—-pep pills and
diet pills. That is cause for concern.”

The study showed that cocaine
had been used by approximately 17
percent of the graduating seniors.
Cocaine usage rose sharply from
1976-1979 and is now remaining sta-
ble. Barbiturates had been used by
11 percent of students in 1981, and
LSD usage remained at 10 percent.
Among those on the decline are
PCP and tranauilizers.

“I believe these statistics do affect
college campuses though we'have
never done any specific studies for
campuses,” said O’Malley.

“We did do a follow-up paper on
the habits of students after gradua-
tion from high school, which can be
broken down into three categories:
those who stayed at home, those
who left home to get married and
those who left home and settled
among their peers.

“Those who left home and mar-
ried showed a decrease in drug
usage, those who stayed at home
were relatively unchanged and
those who left home and lived
among peers showed an increase in
their drug usage. These are primar-

-ily college students.”

O’Malley is concerned about the
rise in the use of stimulants.

“There has been a sharp rise in
the use of these stimulants in both
recreational and non-recreational
use—a person’s personal use, just
as we reported in the study.” He
said this is due mostly to promotion
and sales of two types of non-
controlled stimulant products: over-
the-counter diet pills and
“look-alikes” that contain caffeine.

At the end of the study, Johnston
said, “for more than a decade now,
American young people have had
exceptionally high rates of illicit drug
use when comparing them to pre-
vious generations and other coun-
tries. There are encouraging signs
toward moderation in use of most
drugs, but the rise in the use of stim-
ulants is troubling.”

The Campus

Drug Scene:  
Student Use

College, for many young peo-
ple, has often been a time for
experimentation. Social norms,
talents and relationships are
tested and molded for the future.

College is also the time when
experimentation with drugs is
done. Cocaine, marijuana, pills,
hallucinogens and alcohol are all
part of the college scene.

Paul, a graduate student, said
he likes the effects he can get
from drugs, expecially
hallucinogens. '

“I enjoy the feeling,” he said.
“It’s a constant expanding
experience.”

Paul said he has experimented
with a lot of drugs, but prefers

what he calls “organic” drugs—. ‘

cocaine, mushrooms and mari-
juana. He said he doesn’t take
pills such as speed becuase he
does not trust the effects they
can have on the body.

He said he likes‘ cocaine but

does not do it very often because .

of both the price and the feeling.

“Coke is just something you
get and do all at once because it
is a very pleasing drug,” said
Paul.

Barbara, another Pitt student,
said that although her boyfriend
and his friends dabble in cocaine,
speed and marijuana, she shys
away from those and only drinks
alcohol.

“I never felt like doing any-
thing else,” she said. “I used to
smoke a lot of pot when I was in
high school, but I just lost my
taste for it.”

Barbara said sometimes she
feels out of place when all her
friends are getting high and she’s
not, but she’s learned to deal
with it.

Although June said she does
take drugs, she said she takes
them mainly for recreational
purposes.

 

“I do drugs mostly for fun; I
like the highs and the lows,” she
said. “It depends on what kind of
mood you’re in, sometimes the
drug just makes it better.”

She said she likes cocaine, but
can’t afford it, so she mainly
sticks with pills. She usually
takes the “up” drugs, with an
occasional quaalude or valium.

June said she sees nothing
wrong with using drugs recrea-
tionally, although some people
don’t know when to stop.

Ken said he stays away from
drugs of all kind. He drinks beer
and other alcoholic beverages,
but that’s as far as it goes.

“l’ve smoked pot a few times,
but l’ve never tried anything
harder,” he said.

Many of his friends and
acqaintances make fun ofhim
and try to persuade him to try
other things, but Ken said he
always holds his ground.

“I don’t like drugs,” he said. “I
think they’re bad for the body
and worse for the mind.”

Most of the people inter-
viewed said they do not have a
hard time finding the drugs they
take. There's usually friends who
know somebody that can always
get them a line on where to
acquire the drugs.

“I don’t go around buying
them,” June said. “You always
know where you can find them.
A friend or a friend of a friend.”

Aside from Ken, nobody said
there is a big drug problem on
Pitt’s campus. They said ever-
yone they know experiments
with some sort of drug, but that’s
as far as it goes.

As one girl said, “I don’t know
too many junkies.”

the Big East championships.

Julie aul and the Lady Panther volleyball team travel to Provide this weekend for ~

Gene Larson ls NotResentful

By BARRY ZASLOFF

He attended Kitsap High School

 in Silverdale, Wash., where volley-.

"ball is about as foreign as suntan
lotion is in Siberia. After two years-
at Washington State University,
where the volleyball program was
at club status, he transferred to San
Bernardino Valley, a two-yearjun—
ior college and a hotbed for college
volleyball.

After his tenure there, he jour-
neyed to Pitt for his final two years
of college eligibility. Here, the
story unfolds. With a will to corri-
pete, but not enough money to
stay at Pitt, where rnen’s volleyball
scholarships are not offered, Gene
Larson played last year but
dropped out this year.

Larson was primarily used as a

"strong side hitter—a spiker. Take

1 ..

that set and smash it to the ground.

Sad thing: For all those spikes,
for all the points that he was
directly responsible for, for all the
talent he brought to Pitt, he
received nothing in return from
Pitt’s administration.

Funny thing: The thought of
this, which would make many
cringe, didn’t faze Larson in the
least. He took it as part of life.

“I came to Pitt hoping they’d
give me a scholarship alter the first
year,” Larson explains without the
slightest bitterness in his words.
“At the end of the school year, -I
realized that I wouldn’t get any
money.

“I touldn’t go into debt any
further,” he says. “But I don’t res-
ent the Pitt administration. IfIwas
meant to go back, God would have
provided me with the needs. Right

then, I knew that I wouldn’t go
back."

Pitt men’s volleyball coach Ray
Reilly isn’t that trusting. No
wonder. He has witnessed one of
Pitt’s most talented volleyball
players slip through his hands.
How does Reilly assess Larson?

“Gene Larson was one of the best
players we've ever had,” Reilly
says. “He was a hard worker with a
great attitude.”

In volleyball terms, he has it
all——defense, blocking, hitting and
passing. As for money—he had
nothing. Not a cent.

“Money was the problem,”
Reilly says. “We had nothing to
give him. The women’s program is
allotted enough to give some play-
ers full rides, but we get nothing.

By MARK A. SINDLER

There was a. group of athletes
who had one common attribute
among them. They wanted to play
volleyball. That sounded fair
enough. Nine girls who desired to
compete in the sport—but could
they?

No doubt, they all had the abil-
ity, but for most, experience was
lacking. Most -of them had not
played together. Seen as somewhat
inconsistent, without much colle-
giate experience, an assortment of
unsure volleyball players set out on
an adventure that would see them
engage in 41 sometimes trying, but
always demanding matches.

And that same group now? Well,
as they prepare for Friday's Big
East Championships at Providence
College, the Lady Panthers are
seeded no lower than No. 1,

There’s no doubt that the Lady
Panthers deserve the top seed. This
is the prize for the team’s experien-
ces these last two and a half
months. As Coach Shelton Collier
earlier admitted, “We’re shooting
for all themarbles.”

Gene Larson

The squad is ranked above seven
other schools from the conference.
If Pitt is going to face any opposi-
tion this Friday, Georgetown and
Providence are prime candidates.
“Providence is 28-15, and George-
town is 29-l l," Collier said.‘ “They
have five or six losses which could
have gone either way and given us
identical records.”

Collier is now optimistic, and
his team is prepared to play; how-
ever, he does not want to engage in
“sure-fire speculations" about the
team’s finish. He is in a position
where all his players are set to play
well, especially as there is no one
player to depend on.

“In my three years at Pitt, this
team is the one with the leasftalent.
But it seems to have a binding effect
on the team," Collier said.
“They’ll play well because there
are no superstars or All-Americas
on the team. It’s, their time in the
limelight to make the most of it.”

“The team has rallied,” Collier
said, “and everyone has played
together. That’s the key. It's an
interesting chemistry that binds

poll, following its 31-16 upset loss to Notre I)ame Saturday.

Georgia (9-0), captured the top spot in l)oth polls on the strength
of its 4-1-0 victory over Florida. Southern Methodist (9-0) moved up

to second in both polls.

With its 54-0 win over North Carolina State, Penn State moved to

Panther Booters.
Lose To IUP, 3-1

By JIM coums

It was a fitting finish to a disap-
pointing season for the Pitt
Panther soccer team. Passing errors
and mental lapses enabled Indiana
University of Pennsylvania to
emerge victorious, 3-1.

From the outset, both teams had
numerous scoring chances. Steve
McLaughlin gave IUP a 1-0 lead 10
minutes into the game. McLaugh-
lin intercepted a pass from Pitt’s
jimmy Steale, dribbled to the 18
and drilled the ball in the upper
corner of the net.

John Hagenbuch quickly tied

, the score. Hagenbuch stole the ball

from IUP goal keeper Greg Joseph
and kicked it into the open net.

the ball into the penalty box from
the sideline. After a scramble in
front of the net, Pitt’s Uzoma Chi-

out of position. An alert defense
man for IUP booted the ball away
before it crossed the goal line.

The game’s pace slowed down in
the second half. Neither team had
good chances to score. While the
midfield for IUP controlled the
game, the Panther defense
remained strong. I

With five minutes remaining,
IUP scored the insurance goal. For-
ward Gee Peckich faked out two
defenders and drilled the ball past
goalie Dave Torrence.

Despithe big plays of Irishquarterback Bl

still has a shot at a major bowl bid.

A Cloud Lined With Silver

By BRIAN BALK

Let it first be said that I am an
eternal optimist. I tend to look
on the brighter side of things——
even upsets. Last weekend’s loss
to Notre Dame is no different.
There is a bright side. though it
is easily masked by Pitt's fall
from the top.

"“ It is not very often that a
team with the fourth most diffi-
cult schedule in the land goes
undefeated. Prior statistics
show that almost all teams,
even those perched in the No. 1
seat, are bound to lose at least
once. Undefeated teams are
rare.

"‘ The Panther schedule is
never complete without the
annual interstate duel against
rival Penn State on Thanksgiv-
ing weekend. This year’s game
promises to exhibit college

football at its best because many
view the Panthers and the Lions
as being the real No. land No. 2
teams in the nation.

In last year’s game, Pitt fell
behind after taking an early 14-
0 lead. Then one mistake fol-
lowed another. The Panthers
watched their national cham-
pionship hopes become water-
logged, then finally sink after
the final gun sounded.

This year's game will differ
drastically. The Panthers will
not be seated No. 1 entering the
game. The main concern will
be to redeem the pride which
was-stolen a year ago. The
Panthers will enter the game
with revenge on their mind.

"“ Losing to the Fightinglrish
undoubtedly hurt the Panthers
in the polls, for they committed
the sin of Collegiate football:
losing in November. This
undoubtedly hindered their

51.. Kiel and the loss to Notre am Pitt

The Pitt‘News, Wednesday November 10, ‘I982 - ~

chances of receiving a major
bowl bid. But one need not
worry about watching the
Panthers tayngling in the bowl
of Peaches or Tangerines. Pitt
will receive a respectful bid.

The three ca“nference
winners-—-most likely, Georgia,
SMU and Nebraska—will auto-
matically earn Sugar, Cotton
and Orange bowl invitations.
The four top teams in the run-
ning for pairings opposite these
teams are: Penn State, LSU,
Pitt and the runner-up in the
PAC l0-either Washington or
Arizona State.

"“ Anytime the Panthers suffer
a loss, there are not usually
many highlights to dwell on.
The loss to Notre Dame, how-
ever, does not spell “washed-
up" for the Panthers. The upset
will just realign the Panther
energy from striving for an
undefeated season to shooting
for revenge against Penn State.

both younger and older players.
We started believing in one
another, and it has had a snowball
effect." '

This was not the case in August.
Upon holding the first team meet-
ing, everyone looked around at
each other with considerable doubt
in his eyes.

“I kind of expected an up and
down season," he explained. “But
I’m really impressed with our con-
sistency and winning six tourna-
ments. I did not expect that.”

Collier expects freshmen Sally
Gillespie and Carmen Tapia to be
the most consistent performers and
provide the leadership, as they have
all season long. The same can be
said of captain Julie Gaul and
senior Diane Zack, even though
they have had some “off matches,”
according to Collier.

The Lady Panthers have reached
the culmination of a full year's
work. It has taken a lot of playing

time for the Lady Panthers to.

attain the outstanding record they
have this season. The same is true
of Tennessee and Ohio State.
These victories were surprising. If
the Lady Panthers hold true to
form, there may be a few more sur-
prises this weekend.

Here_ are the other schools and
the likelihood——-or lack thereof——of
their t0DDling Pitt.

GEORGETOWN: Joe McClure
leads his Hoyas into New England
with a 29-1 1 record and no injuries.
Earlier in the year, though, he was
unsure of the team’s fate.

“The season started out badly,”

 ‘ ‘ "The Pitt" News,‘ weahesaay‘N‘overhber"10,’D1982

he admitted. “If we had played our
first matches like the last 10 or 12
lately, we would be better off now.”

McClure is counting heavily on
Nicole Gigger. He rates her as one
of the best hitters in the East and a
“mainstay in the offense."

PROVIDENCE: Perhaps the
biggest advantage Coach Dick
Bagge could take into this cham-
pionship series is the home-court
advantage. The surroundings will
be familiar to his players and the
fans should give Providence an
edge.

Providence sports a 28-15 record
and, earlier last week, won the state
championship by defeating neigh-
boring Rhode Island. Bagge is dis-
sastified with his tean1’s record,
though.

“We should be 32-11," he said.
“Due to injuries and a couple of
players dropping out, we have had
some problems.”

If Providence has a weak point,
Bagge said, it's at the second mid-
dle blocker position. His. overall
defense, however, is solid.

“My kids have played where no
ball would hit the floor," Bagge
said.

If Providence expects to face Pitt
in the finals, it should be noted that
it lost to Georgetown three times in
four meetings this season. The
road to Pitt winds through George-
town.

Two years ago—the two have
not met this year—Providence
played Pitt in AIAW competition
at Penn State, losing 15-12 and I5-
13.

VILLANOVA: The ‘Lady Wild-
cats are currently 26- l 7

SYRACUSE: Coach Mark Mas-
sey’s squad started strong but fi§i
ished weak. His I6-20 team
“faltered at mid-season, having dif-
ficulties in attitude and not play-
ing as they should have been."

Syracuse may have to rely on
serving for its primary strong com-
ponent. “We get a lot of first game
wins by serving tough,” he said.

Syracuse has played Providence
and Boston College twice each,
splitting the four matches. Syra-
cuse’s 5-3 conference record indi-
cates that it can play against some
of the stronger teams, but Massey’s
projection of finishing third inf»
field of eight teams may be asking
too much of his players.

CONNECTICUT: Consistency
has been the weak point for the
Lady'Huskies. This has led to a
16-22 match record. _

“We are not consistent overall,”
Coach Ruth Mead said. “There are
the ups and downsjust likea yo—yo.
Sometimes, we give schools like
Pitt 21 run for their money. Other
times, it seems there’s no rotation
at all."

BOSTON COLLEGE: Coach
Dawn Rice is in her second year
and recently ended theseason with
an even 9-9 mark. That is no small
feat, considering she guided a team
that in her rookie year was 4-12.
Even though two of her major star-
ters are out with leg injuries, Rice
remained confident. “We can hold
our own, just as long were not
intimidated.”

SETON HALL: In its first year
in Division I, Seton Hall’s season
average is over .500; however, it has
yet to win a conference match.
