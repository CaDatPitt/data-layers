Pitt agrees to pay
taxes on apartments

By Jennifer Calabrese

News Editor

Pitt has agreed to pay taxes on
several university—owned
buildings, including 16 apartment
houses and the space rented by
Roy Rogers restaurant in the
Cathedral of Learning.

The university’s tax-exempt
status came to issue in February
when the city challenged the tax-
exempt status of Pitt Stadium, Pitt
President Wesley Posvar’s home
in Shadyside, Roy Rogers and the
apartment buildings Pitt owns in
South Oakland.

In return for reclassifying the
apartments and Roy Rogers as
taxable, the challenges to the
president’s mansion and the
stadium were dropped. The
settlement was reached after nine

months of negotiation with three
taxing bodies —— the city, county

and will generate an estimated
$80,000 in revenue for those
taxing bodies.

City finance director Ben
Hayllar could not be reached for
comment yesterday. A statement
released by the university said
that Pitt is pleased with the
settlement.

“I am very pleased that we
have arrived at a mutually
satisfactory agreement that will
serve in the best interests of the
citizens of our region,” Posvar
said in the statement.

Harassing phone calls to students at all time high

By Renee Crespy
StajflVr1'ler

There has been an increase in the number
of harassing phone calls being reported
by students this year, according to Walt
Waters, assistant director of the department
of public safety.

“It’s hard to believe the increase in calls
so far, and we’re already ahead for this
year, but maybe the increase is due to the
fact that more people are reporting them
this year,” said Waters.

In 1987 students reported 47 harassing
phone calls; 59 were reported in 1988 and
in 1989. Since Jan. 1990, there have been
62 harassing phone calls reported already.

“Hopefully the university will get some-
thing to trace calls, but until then the best
advice we can offer students is to keep
track of the telephone calls, and we can
possibly come up with some follow—up.

The problem with tracing calls is that

[Bell of Pennsylvania] usually doesn’t
bother to put a tracer on if there have been
only a couple of prank calls. The student
usually has to receive a number of calls
before anything can be done, and if a
student does get a tracer on their phone,
they must sign a document stating that
they will prosecute,” said Waters.

The University used to have a system
where you could trace calls, but when
they bought the phone system off of Bell,
they did not keep that system because of
financial reasons.

“Anything from a crank call to sexual
remarks to threatening a person is con-
sidered harassment by communica-
tions,”said Waters.

According to Bruce Hutchison, director
of telecommunications, the university is
not aware of any other services available
in western Pennsylvania other than tracing.

“The only advice we can give at present
is for the student or group to change their

number,” Hutchison said. “We’ve found
that this method is successful. Usually if
the person is malicious and just out to
cause trouble, changing the number will
usually stop them.”

Pam Gennaula, student coordinator for
Telefact says that with the nature of their
business, they really don’t get a lot of
prank calls. “Occasionally we get people
that call and hang up, but any questions
that people ask we take seriously. A lot of
students call up and complain about the
university, but we report them to the
proper authorities.”

“I guess people would rather ask a
question than make prank calls, when
they call and ask us a goofy question we
usually try to answer it.‘We have trained
professionals here to do that,” she said.

Other groups and organizations around
campus don’t take prank phone calls as
lightly. The BIGALA group for one.

Melissa Smith, co-president of BIGALA

finds the phone calls very distressing. “We
pay our tuition bills and where is our
money going? The university should do
something about this, especially with all
the students complaining in the towers
about prank calls. I filed two police
complaints, I went to the affirmative action
office three or four times, and all anyone
told me to do was keep track of the calls,
or change our number which we can’t do
since we’re an organization.

“The only solution they offered, was to
get a caller I.D. that traces all calls made on
campus, but it cost a lot of money. I guess
before the university bought the telephone
system off of Bell, they used to have a
device that could trace calls, and I think
they should get it again.” .

“Campus police also told me not to
worry about the phone calls, because it’s
the silent people that could cause harm,
not the ones who call and harass, as if that
makes me feel better,” said Smith.

New Gree/e Oj7iC87”S will workfor expansion, education

By Karen D. Speece
Senior Staff Writer

Darin McMullen said that his goals are
to make better use of committees and
concentrate on educating new Greek
members shortly after he was elected
president of the Inter—Fraternity Council
for next year at a meeting in the William
Pitt Union on Tuesday.

“My platform is based on experience,
expansion and involvement,” McMullen
said. “There are a lot of issues we face as
an IFC. Some of the things I would like to
see are the expansion of the new
committees we created. Member education
is perhaps the most important [aspect],
because educating our members is a vital

9 part of a strong Greek system.

“For the scholarship committee, which
was also created this year, I would like to
see seminars held with the house chairmen.
I’d also like to work more with the Black
Greek Council. I think they are a vital part

of this IFC, and I support the new ideas

 

that they bring forth,” McMullen said.
Socially, McMullen will also try to
organize a casino night, which will be a
philanthropic effort and an all-Greek mixer
at Zelda’s Greenhouse. An all-Greek
council with the Panhellenic Association,
strengthening the quality and quantity of
the existing chapters on campus instead of

expanding the number of houses, and,

increasing the quality of rush are also
among his goals for the semester.

“This is your IFC. There is no reason
why you shouldn’t be involved. We should
all work together,” McMullen said.

McMullen, current Inter-Fraternity
Council external vice president and brother
of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, defeated Dave
Forti, Phi Gamma Delta for the position.

Bernie Etters, Phi Kappa Theta; Andy
Feldman, Zeta Beta Tau and Steve Hill,
Lambda Chi Alpha, competed for the
position of internal vice president. After
two rounds of voting, Andy Feldman was
elected to the position.

“I feel that as a system, it is very
important that we have some semblance
of unity. lt’s obviously very important that
each house maintain a certain amount of
its uniqueness, but the system as a whole
has to function, and it functions best if we
are all on the same page, so to speak,"
Feldman said.

Feldman will concentrate on
strengthening rush and relations with the
judicial board.

Fraternity representatives elected Scott
Segnere, president of Delta Tau Delta, for
external vice president over Rich Laughlin,
president of Kappa Sigma.

“We don’t have a very good outlook; we
need to change that,” Segnere said.

Segnere’s concerns for the term include

Neo l/ision owner bopes to Change Oct/elcmd Zoo/e

By Kathy Kmiecik
For The Pitt News

Walking into the offices of Neo
Vision at 3501 Forbes Ave., one
immediately realizes that this is
no ordinary opthamologist’s
office. The new—wave art—deco
decor, complete with tract lighting
and oversized ﬂower arrange-
ments, is a mirror reflection of its
owner, Dr. Lawrence Gipson.

Gipson, at age 39, is the head
opthamologist and owner of three
Neo Vision offices in the Pitts-
burgh area. A graduate of Pitt’s

medical school, Gipson is a
clinical instructor at the university
and currently on the staff of St.
Clair and Mon Valley hospitals.

Although he is a busy man,
Gipson said that there are reasons
he decided to go through the
hassle of opening an office in
Oakland.

Gipson believes Oakland is the
ideal place to locate his third
store. “Sometimes going against
the stream is the shortest way,”
explains Gipson.

He feels that with the diverse
population ofstudent and faculty

members here, he can’t lose. He
also sees Pitt as an u p-and-coming
area, similar to the atmosphere of
other college campuses around
the country where many fine
shops and businesses take root.
Gipson says he would like to see
Oakland become a better place.
“What you put out you will get
back,” says Gipson of his efforts
at improving Oakland’s image.
“And right now the business end
of Oakland is a mess.”

Neo Vision attempts to appeal
to all types ofpatients by offering
a wide variety of products, such

as unusual jewelry and eyeglasses
ranging from $80 to $800.
According to Gipson, "There is
no substitute for quality.” Neo
Vision also offers discounts to
students which Gipson hopes will
help curb the ever-increasing
costs of college.

When Gipson isn’t examining
patients, he enjoys a variety of
outside activities. He is a season
ticket holder for the Pittsburgh
Penguins, the opera, the
Pittsburgh Ballet and the
symphony. He also attends an
occasional Pitt football game.

Sexual harassment is a major problem in today’s world.
It is unfortunate when it begins to interfere with people’s
jobs. Finally, however, something has been done to
combat this problem in, of all places, the National Football
League.

On Sept. 17, Lisa Olson, a sports reporter for the Boston
Herald, was interviewing one of the New England Patriots
after a game, when Patriots’ tight end Zeke Mowatt
allegedly approached her and made rude comments and
physical gestures toward her. Teammates Robert Perryman
and Michael Timpson were also involved, encouraging
Mowatt.

Because of this, Mowatt was originally fined $2,000 by
the Patriots. However, many people were not satisfied.
They said that this was not enough.

Tuesday, the Patriots paid for their actions. NFL
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, after a two—month
investigation, fined Mowatt an additional $12,500 for
“both verbal and demonstrative actions.” In addition,
Perryman and Timpson each received $5,000 penalties for
encouraging Mowatt during his exhibition. ~

The team was fined $25,000 for its handling of th
situation. The Patriots were also required to pay an extra
$25,000 which will go towards educating NFL players in
how to deal with the media.

A report released by the committee said that Patriot
General Manager Patrick Sullivan “failed to probe more
deeply in his meeting with Patriots personnel because he
felt his job was ‘not to investigate but to focus on winning
games.”’ '

The report also criticized Patriots’ owner Victor Kiam,
saying that the team “reacted  too slowly and with too
little regard for the proper enforcement of league rules.”

If Patriot players are so worried about winning games,
one thing that might help them would be fan support. By
covering up a scandal, however, they could very well lose
that support. For this, they are to be punished.

This action by Tagliabue is to be commended. He did
not give the players overly-exorbitant fines, yet made
them so that they would understand the severity of their
actions. His actions toward the team, while criticizing
their poor effort, also will improve the quality of the
league’s relations with the media, as the money will go to
educating the players.

So far this season, Paul Tagliabue has had to deal with
a few incidents involving the press and NFL teams. He
fined Cincinnati Bengals’ Coach Sam Wyche $55,000 for
barring the press from the locker room after a game. With
this additional action, T agliabue has shown that he is very
capable of dealing with discrimination by the teams.

Stiffen penalties for drug pushers

The media have been dominated by the subject

of drugs. Every day somewhere in the world
someone is caught buying drugs; someone is
.caught selling drugs, and someone is caught using
drugs. “Miami Vice" might never have existed if
Don Johnson couldn’t have arrested people for
possession of illegal drugs.

The media, as well as politicians, have gotten
involved with the drug problem. Everything that is
“bad” in the United States is blamed on the infamous
“drug war.” According to the National Review,
President Bush announced in his inaugural address

The best way to deal with the drug problem is to

have harsher penalties for dealers and users. The —

only way that people in the United States are going
to see the “not-so—glamorous” side of drugs is to
show them the reality of criminal life. We as
Americans have to take a stand that will be an
example for all to follow.

We have been too soft on drug dealers and users.
The overcrowding of jails has led many judges to
send ﬁrst—time offenders away with mere probation.
How are we to send a message out to drug dealers
that we mean business, if they know that they can

that the “scourge will stop.” Bush

resigned. No one had more ideas
or enthusiasm about the solutions to the problem
than Bennett. His resignation leaves me wondering
if anyone is capable of handling the problem.

It’s about time that Americans do something. It’s
pretty disgusting that we have 13-Year—olds in our
nation who are drug addicts. It’s even worse that
some of these same kids are dealing drugs. These
kids are getting their drug supply from someone.
What’s so disheartening is that these “drug suppliers”
never seem to be punished.

Nancy Reagan decided to combat the drug
problem with her “Just say no” campaign. I agree
with Mrs. Reagan that our nation needs to be
educated about the harmful effects of drugs. I had
to sit through many high school health-education
classes listening to speeches about the ill effects of
drugs. I am all for drug education. But there comes
a point when over-education falls on deaf ears. In
my own case my friends and I ended up being
bored with drug education instead of inspired.
There is only so much you can do with education.
There comes a point in all of our lives when we
have to take our education and make an informed
decision. Some people will choose to get involved
with drugs. What should we do with these people
who choose to break the law?

possible. Drug money is keeping
these dealers out of the jails and in the streets.

Manuel Noriega is a prime example of our stupidity
with the drug problem. Noriega was once on the
CIA payroll for being a drug informant. So, what do
we do with him? We invade Panama to get this
“drug king" out. We ﬁnally have him in our
possession, and we don’t sentence him. The
American taxpayer is paying for his legal costs and
to have his case sit in the courts while our drug
problem gets worse.

The only plausible solution to the war on drugs
is a hardline approach. A jail sentence with
mandatory rehabilitation is the only way that drug
dealers will get the message that we mean business.
It’s very simple: Let’s lock up these offenders.

Our government has to take a serious stand.
Somebody has to be tough, and it might as well be
the courts. Until we start to really punish these
offenders, the problem won’t go away.

Maybe part of our drug-education classes should
include a visit to a prison. Maybe that would make
the message a lot clearer: Your involvement in
drugs will only lead you behind these iron bars.

The Civic Arena conjured up
images of a return of Gunther
Gable Williams and his three-
ring circus right from the start
Tuesday night, as ex—Penguin
Chris Joseph scored his first goal

concern to a team that has been
struggling. The Penguins have
accomplished none of the goals
that Coach Bob Johnson had set
forth this season. Defense —
nada, forget it. The Pens gave up
40 shots, and Johnson said that
Frank Pietrangelo played fine in
goal. Anytime you give up seven

in two years,

goals, you are

just49seconds not playing
into the game  well. In
against Ed— fairness to

monton. And it was on with the
show.

Phil Borque continued his ﬁne
offensive play of late by chipping
in two ﬁrst—p€tiod goals, and the
Pens held a 5-2 edge after a

g frenzied first period that saw 32

shots combined. The rest of the
way it was all Edmonton, as the
Oilers blew by the Pens’ defense.
No. 1 star Petr Klima pumped in
a goal and an assist, and captain
Mark Messier dished out four
assists to pace the Oilers, who
upped their season mark to 7-13-
2. By the way, it was the Oilers’
second road victory of the season
— the other coming at Toronto.

Last year the Pens would have
drooled to be in a shootout like
this on home ice, but this year
the Pens have tried at home by
hot~dogging in front of the
homeboys and girls. Tuesday they
got their wish, and it backﬁred
on them.

Not only was the Pens’ defense
ineffective, but forechecking did
not exist. The Oilers added more

Frank, often times he was left
alone, one-on—one as the Oilers
swooped down on a 5—on-2
break. But Pietrangelo is getting
into the habit of showing up one
game then taking the next one
off. He was only partially visible
Tuesday after a splendid
performance on Saturday. In all
honesty, Johnson should have
pulled Frankie and put in Wendell
Young. Too often Pietrangelo is
unable to rebound from a poor
start. He is not the kind of
goaltender who shuts the door
after allowing a couple of
quickies.

The question now, besides the
glaring inconsistencies on
defensive-minded hockey, is
what has become of T om Barasso
and Robbie Brown? Brown has
been mentioned in every trade
talk in the NHL the past few
seasons but has remained in
Pittsburgh. It could be Brown’s
time to fly.

Hartford GM Eddie Johnston
has wanted Brown’s services

Paul Diamond/The Pitt News

Bill Ranford started his 44th straight game in goal as he led his team to a 7-3 victory Tuesday night.

since he left the Penguin
organization a few years back.
Johnston has been known to
make trades out of desperation
in the past, and the Whalers need
more ﬁrepower since the trade
of Ray Ferraro. Look for
something to give here because
Johnson has said that he is not
pleased with Brown’s scoring

Patriots, players fined $72,500

National Football League Commissioner Paul
Ta gliabue issued fines on Tuesday as a result of the
Sept. 17 incident in the New England Patriots’
locker room involving Lisa Olson, a reporter for

the Boston Herald.

Pats’ tight end Zeke Mowatt received the greatest
fine, $12,500, while defensive back Michael
Timpson and ex-Patriot running back Robert
Perryman each were ﬁned $5,000.

The team must pay $50,000 in ﬁnes, half of

which is to be spent on better preparing players in
dealing with the media.

Phillip Heymann which said Mowatt's conduct

involved both verbal and physical abuse. It also

Patriots’ owner Victor Kiam said his team will

Mans cross Countrj/ﬁnishes season

By Sharon Kerestes
Staﬁ" Writer

The men's cross country team

" completed a successful season

last Monday at the NCAA
Championships in Knoxville,
Tenn., with a 17th-place ﬁnish,
and senior Keith Dowling came
away from it-an All—American.
Dowling finished 12th out of
181 runners and completed the
6.2—mile course in 29 minutes, 47

, seconds.

“I think I ran the best race I
possibly could have,” he said.

Also scoring points for Pitt were
Scott Humphrey (77th place),
Mike Formica (84), Jason Bodnar
(147) and Dave Hackworth (153).

“We were ranked last coming
into lnationalsl,” said Coach Jim
Lear. “But we proved to a few

"people that we were better than

they thought. ”
Dowling and Humphrey are
the team's only graduating

seniors, but Lear knows his loss is
unmeasurable when it comes to
those two. '

Humphrey has finished
consistently as Pitt’s second or
third man this year and provided
a key performance in the win
over Penn State in September.

Dowling, the team's No. 1
runner all year, was unbeaten
until the regional meet on Nov.
10.

“He was always the guy you
could count on. We knew we
had someone who could ﬁnish
high up in the standings,” said
Lear. “We may never have that
again to that extent.”

A York, Pa., native, Dowling
also made All-American honors
in track last spring in the 10,000
meters. This fall, he set out to
repeat that kind of performance
in cross country. Now, he said,
it’s time to make the next step up.
He’d like to win or at least
challenge for a national

championship in indoor or
outdoor track.

“You never really stay at one
place too long; you keep
progressing,” he said. “This has
pushed me up to the next step on
the ladder. I proved to myself
now that I can run with these
guys.”

The team as a whole certainly
knows about progressing. For
the past few years these runners
have struggled against opponents
and themselves. This season was
a culmination of their efforts and
Lear’s to put together a nationally
competitive team.

“We accomplished a lot [this
season], probably more than any
Pitt team has ever done,” Lear
said.

But, he said, there’s still more
to do in the future.

“I think we have a nucleus that
can still come back to the NCAAs
next year," he said. “I think that’s
their goal.”

production.

How about Tommy B? Since
playing poorly last week against
Philadelphia, Barasso has been
benched (not even dressed) for
the Pens’ last three outings. The
trade mill is also starting ta turn,-
as Barasso’s name is being
mentioned. Management should
make sure it likes what it has in

the nets now before trading away
the man that should be the
backbone of this hockey club.
Or else management better get
another solid goalie if some type
of a deal is worked out for Barasso.
Relying en Pietrangelo the test of
the way would be suicide. The

Pens are now 11-11-2 and falling V

These metal women aren’t
bleached blondes spilling out of
their XS (extra sleazy) leather
halter tops while screaming the
lyrics to \Y/arrant’s “Cherry Pie.”
Susan Gottfried and Mary Bielich,

2» who are at the forefront of the
hottest heavy—metal radio show,
are metal women with minds.

Disc jockeying \VPTS’s Metal
Zone and the Metal Overnight,
Gottfried says, “The reason I work
in metal is because I find it very
sensuous and very sexual.”

“I’m into metal for the pure
appreciation of the music and the
fun,” says Bielich, Gottfried’s

4 cohort.

As women working in heavy
metal, both Gottfried and Bielich
admit having to deal with some
stereotypes that often accompany
women in the music biz. Bielich,
who is in an all—women, death-
metal band, says, “I’m just as
much of a musician as [men] are,
so I avoid the skirts and push-up
bras because there is a lot of
sexism in heavy metal.”

Gottfried says, “The image
comes from the videos. I love
Motley Crue, but they have these
women running around in these
skirts that barely cover [them]. A
bikini would cover more of [them].
We see these rock stars swooning
over these women with perfect
‘bodies and this nothing clothing

on, and they think that’s the way

to get close to a rock star.”
Bielich maintains that these type
of bands, often called “glam”
bands, have, “a lot of these guys
that are geeks with long hair
abusing their reputations,” she

says, “and the girls are just looking .

“for a place to belong.” , _ __ ~ ' '    - g ‘ _ V 

Gottfried, who likes the music ’ ' A A 

of the glam bands, says, “I don’t

interests than academic by playing with
the orchestra.

Heather Harrier, a second-year law

is “a really good experience and more
simply, an opportunity to play.” As principal
cellist, she has been with the orchestra for
approximately a year and a half.

They can be non-music major students,

As the lights in Bellefield Annex Hall
slowly turned down on Wednesday
evening, Nov. 14, the sounds of the
orchestra tuning quieted to an anxious
lull. Soon thereafter, the footsteps of
conductor Kypros Markou were heard
tapping their way out to the front of the
stage. In a split second the orchestra

Tim Buckley

5 Dream Letter; Live in London,
1968

Enigma Retro/Straight

To be honest, I never even
heard of Tim Buckley until last
summer. Since then I have
become the proud owner of
several of his albums, and I think

_ that you should, too.

By way of introduction, Tim
Buckley possessed one of the
most remarkable voices ever
committed to vinyl. It spanned
several octaves and as often as
not, he used his voice as an
incredibly expressive instrument.
He would go from a soft, low
moan to a high banshee wail --
from a whisper to a scream, as
the saying goes. He was also a
gifted and versatile songwriter.
Before his untimely death in 1975,

Soundings

an ear for the finer things

 

 

he recorded nine albums, which
ranged from the folk and folk-
rock of Tim Buckleyand Goodbye
and Hello to the folk—jazz of
Happy/Sad and Blue Aﬂemoon,
to the more experimental Lorca

and Starsailor, to the funk of his
last three albums, which I have
yet to hear.

This two—cassette/CD set,
previously unreleased and newly
mastered, captures him during
his folk-jazz phase and is as good
an introduction to him as any.
Buckley’s voice and 12—string
guitar are in fine form, as well as
his backup: Lee Underwood,
author of the liner notes, on
electric guitar; David Friedman
on vibes and bassist non-pariel
Danny Thompson. Dreamletter

Hello and Happy/Sad six songs

and, at the end of “Pleasantstreet,”
the best cover of “You Keep Me
Hangin’ On" that l’ve ever heard;
of course, Vanilla Fudge doesn’t
offer much competition.
Dreamletzer is also a live album;
it hails from a time when popular
major—label artists (which Tim
Buckley was at the time) were
allowed to follow their muses
(and not a computerized audio-

visual special effects
extravaganza) in concert. On this
album the songs expand and
contract as the musician sees fit.
Even something like the lengthy
tune-up session before
“Hallucinations” becomes
something positive for the album
as Buckley jokes about it. Rather
than it becoming annoying, it
adds to the individuality of this
concert and to the intimacy and
magic of this resulting album.

wild scrotum?).

The dry text of these missives
discuss coitus as if it were an act
done by plants instead of humans,
describing it with phrases and
words like “ejaculate” for “cum,”
or “manual manipulation” in place
of “fingering.” Instead of
rejuvenating a person’s desire for
sex, these books make sex seem
as interesting as conversing with
someone speaking a dead
language.

A look at the cover of Susie
Sexperﬂs Lesbian Sex World by
Susie Bright is enough to dispel
one’s boredom. The title of the
book pops out in Crayola colors
next to a photo of Ms. “Sexpert”
in a tight leather minidress,
cowboy boots and wearing a big

grin on her face (So much for the
so-called frumpy, grumpy
lesbian.) The author has been a
columnist for On Our Backs, “a
magazine for the ‘adventurous’
lesbian”. As well, she is an
educator of safe sex for lesbians
and was once an X-rated movie
critic for Penthousemagazine, and
in case you missed it, she just
lectured at Chatham College about
a month ago.

Needless to say, the woman
knows her stuff, and she tells it in
fast and funny prose. Despite
this, she admits in her introduction
that for most of her life her
knowledge of the kinkier side of
life was, sadly, reﬂective of a
“typical little girl education about
sex.” That is:

living ll up wilh The Lounge Lizards

By Rob Penman
For Tbe Pitt News

Over the past 10 years John Lurie’s Lounge
Lizards have been out and about touring Europe
extensively and releasing over five full-length LPs.
Many are unfamiliar with the jazz squealings of
Lurie’s band; however, his film acting credits, most
notably his lead roles in Jim Jarmusch’s super-
realisms Stranger 779cm Paradise and Down By
Law, have received wider acclaim.

Lurie — the only original Lounge Lizard remaining
(even brother Evan has left for other projects) —
started his musical career playing harmonica in

.bands from his hometown of Worchester, N.Y., at

age 16. Two years later, while on a late-night, angst-
ridden walk after a week of sleepless nights worrying
about a possible Vietnam War draft notice, a man
with a wheelbarrow in tow told Lurie that he was
looking at a statue of an angel, and suddenly it
transformed into a real angel and flew away. A day
later this same shaman-priest-prophet gave Lurie a

saxophone and bicycle so that he could ride into an
uninhabited wooded area and practice. Besides the
harmonica and saxophone, Lurie is accomplished
in the electric guitar and piano, without having had
any formal training.

Categorizing John Lurie’s Lounge Lizards with a
stock label would be a mistake. From a foundation
in traditional bop to Miles Davis—lil<e contemplative
horn meanderings, to avant—dissonant—deconstucto
squank, the Lounge Lizards cover it. Moreover,
what is truly astounding is the means by which
Lurie layers the best in each genre into one piece.

Lurie admits that the Lounge Lizards’ best work
is “not on record by far. A recording studio is a very
difficult, antiseptic kind of thing. Music is not really
about these flat pieces of plastic.” Tonight the
Lounge Lizards will make their first appearance
ever in Pittsburgh. Take advantage of this rare
opportunity to not just see Lurie on screen or
merely listen to the Lounge Lizards in stereo but to
experience them live.

Blaek family struggles in ‘To Sleep With Anger’  

By Dmitri Ragano
Showcase Editor

If you’re looking for a movie
with drama—-—with human beings
instead of effects, depth instead
of flash — then you won’t find a
better bet than T 0 Sleep With
Anger.

Writer-director Charles Burnett
joins the small but outspoken
ranks of major African American
ﬁlmmakers. He is sure to be touted
as “the new Spike Lee," but that
couldn’t be farther from the truth.
Burnett has been making award-
winning, low—budget ﬁlms since
Lee was in grade school. Among

his many awards is the prestigious
“genius grant” given by the
MacArthur Foundation.
In fact, Spike would do good to
hire Burnett as a screenwriter -
he has a wonderful grasp of
characters, heritage and what
makes a drama work. To Sleep
With Anger resembles the plays
of Au gust Wilson more than Lee’s
controversy-ridden cinema.
Burnett’s interest is the black
family and how it struggles against
dark forces of the past and
present.

'Dances With Wolves’:

Hollywood ﬁnally does
Native Americans justice

By Jessica Coville
Asst. Managing Editor

From its breathtaking
panoramic scenes of the South
Dakota Black Hills to Kevin
Costner dramatically renouncing
his status of Army lieutenant,
Dances With Wolves will leave
you re—assessing your sense of
nationalism and wondering why
you never read about Indians
like this in your American history
classes.

One of the bi ggest film gambles
to come from Hollywood this
year, Dances With Wolves is a
surprising tribute to the American
Western —-—-surprising in that it
may be the first portrayal of the
plight of the Native American

S1eep——

characters in T 0 Sleepwho literally
sacrifice their own blood to hold

things together. Mary Alice as

Suzie and Sheryl Lee Ralph as
Babe Brother's wife turn in strong,
resonating performances.

As Harry, Glover is seductive
and slimy, with a million old
stories and card tricks. But despite
all his manipulative wheelings
and dealings, Glover makes him
a real man, not an evil villain in a
movie.

Burnett’s bare-bones
production gives the ﬁlm a sparse,
no-frills look which works well
for this superb, stage—like material.
This is a film to watch and a
filmmaker to watch. And if we’re
lucky, maybe Eddie Murphy will
let him direct Fences.

dialect (with English subtitles),
and the fact that the movie is
three hours long were all concerns
for Costner and the movieland
big boys. Plus its poignantly timed
release (around Thanksgiving)
made this film drive its message
home — the white settlers weren’t
the good guys.

By following Lt. Dunbar’s
(Costner’s) narrative, we can see
one man’s realization of an
indigenous culture being
methodically destroyed. After Lt.
Dunbar befriends the Sioux tribe,
he ﬁnds himself so intrigued with
their lifestyle that he literally
adopts it as his own.

To seal off his separation,
Dunbar assumes the name and
identity of “Dances With Wolves,”
which he receives after a comical
scene with Costner chasing a
wolf. From there, the film traces
Costner’s desertion of the U.S.
Army and eventual marriage in
the midst of an assault by the

American military.

There were stellar per-
formances from the cast all
around. Wind in His Hair (Rodney
Grant) and Kicking Bird (Graham
Greene) were powerful in
portraying two of the main Sioux
characters. Perhaps the most
moving experience of the entire
film is Wind in His Hair’s
declaration from a mountain top
—- it will move even the most
stoic theatergoer.

New York stage star Mary
McDonnell (Stands With A Fist)

must also be commended for her
performance as an American
woman growing up with the Sioux
tribe. Those who thought Dustin
Hoffman did a good job with
Little Big Man will be duly
impressed with McDonnell’s role.

With such films out like Rocky
Vand HomeAl0neit is comforting
to know that we still have some
consciously artistic movies to
choose from. Dances With Wolves
will stay with you long after you

A night of music
‘Over The Edge’

If you think that a concert for
“video, audio, vodka and gerbils”
is a little over the edge, you’re
probably right. But that’s the
whole point of the Pittsburgh
New Music Ensemble’s series
called Over The Edge. The
featured performers aren’t just a
tiny bit odd to the average person
(like Philip Class or Laurie
Anderson are); they literally run
rings around anything else you
could conceive of as being
“experimental” or “avant garde.”
That is, until tomorrow, when
— - — — - — n

COUPON ONLY GOOD
WITH VALID STUDENT l.D.

   
 

 
 

 
     
   
      

 

you’ll quickly become
accustomed to the unusual nature
of the three groups playing in the
second Over The Edge concert at
the Mellon Institute.

Actually, the Swedish group
Phauss isn’t going to repeat its
vodl<a—and-gerbils performance
(or its concert for electric swords
and barbed wire, for that matter),
but it will present a work called
North America - Nothing But the
Truth. The event will consist of
various location-recorded and
atmospheric sounds wrung
through a computer and
scrambled well done —— perhaps
beyond recognition. In addition,
Phauss members C.M. von
Hausswolf and Erik Pauser will
jam on stage with various found
objects and instruments (maybe
even a couple rodents).

A scant 20 minutes before,
fellow Swedes Zbigniew
Karkowski and Ulf Bilting will
take the stage to offer a different,
more academic, perspective on
technology and music: an
interactive piece for performer,
infrared gesture sensors and
computer titled For Me and My
Gods. The sensors will scan the
position and velocity of the
“dancing” performer, transmitting
the data for analysis by
Karkowski’s custom—designed
sequencing program for the
Macintosh. It all sounds very cut
and dried, until you consider the
motives behind the work of
Karkowski/Bilting — they are
interested in music as a magical
domain, in the sense that it creates
a state of mind or mode of action
in the listener. You’ll just have to
see for yourself what will result
from their techno—ritual.

As if those mind~bending
Swedish guys weren’t enoughs,
they brought along their pal
Andrew MacKenzie, the English
mastermind behind the
multimedia group Haﬂer Trio
(which also at one time included
Chris Watson of Cabaret Voltaire).
MacKenzie has been behind such
projects as the Dreammachine,
reconstructing Brion Gysin’s
concept of a rotating audio-
sculpture that produces an altered
mental state in the beholder
(audience?).MacKenzie’s live
sound experiment involves
audiotape manipulation using
several DAT decks at once to
surround the listener with an
inescapable wall of sound.

Over The Edge is an idea way
overdue in a city far behind the
times as far as the arts are
concerned, though with support
from the PNME and the Carnegie
Mellon Activities Board, the avant
garde is now worming into the
establishment here in Pittsburgh.
If someday you see Test
Department, Last Exit or
Diamanda Galas performing at
Carnegie Hall, you’ll know who
to thank for starting the ball
rolling.

Phauss, Karleowski/Bilting and
Haﬂer Trio perform Friday night
at the Mellon Institute, located at

’ Fifth and Belleﬁeld Avenues in

Oakland. The concert begins at 8
pm, and all ages are welcome.

Symphony

 

Continued from page S-2
Westrnoreland Symphony and the
Brevard Symphony in Florida, he
is much admired by the musicians
who play and study under him.

Wallace Moore, who is principal
double bass, has been performing
for two years with the orchestra.
As a member of the community,
Moore says, “This orchestra has
one of the best conductors in
Pittsburgh. Aside from being able

to play, you can learn so much
under him.”

As a sophomore and a pre-
dental major, Matthew Barrabas
has been playing trumpet for the
orchestra for two years now.
Previously performing with the
Pittsburgh Youth Symphony
Orchestra, Barrabas feels that
“Kypros Markou has a great sense
of artistry and musicianship.”

Markou feels that “the

University Symphony Orchestra
is a cultural enrichment for not
only the players but for those
who come to see us perform.”

According to Ron Quinn, a
performing bassoonist, “the
orchestra has been around since
1976. It was founded with the
Heinz Chapel Choir and choral
programs.”

The orchestra consists of
approximately 55 to 60 members

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Thursday, November 29, 1990

who perform four times a year.

Subsequently, because of its
size and diversity, one might
conclude that the members of the
orchestra might not be able to
perform well together. On the
contrary — Wednesday evening ’s
performance was absolutely
brilliant.

The concert was beautifully
opened by the symphony’s
playing of Johann Svendsen’s

“Romance in C,” with Coffman as
featured soloist. The orchestra
its
performance of Edvard Grieg’s

then ascended into
“Old Norwegian Romance.”

Finally after intermission, the

orchestra astoundingly ended _‘

with Franz Joseph Hadyn’s four- 0

part symphony “No. 101 in D.”

Even though the crowd was of

meager size, the applause was

loud and quite appreciative. It
was truly an evening of beauty

and enjoyment.

With little funding from the
school and only small gifts from
appreciative patrons,
orchestra’s publicity is almost non-

existent. This could quite possibly
be Pitt’s best—kept secret, but

hopefully not for long. If anyone

out there has the slightest interest

in enjoyment and beauty, I truly
recommend that you go to the
next concert.

The next performances will be
in late winter and early spring.

does, you need the book more
than you'll ever know). If
you use your imagination,
this book may be applicable
for persons of either gender
and orientations. You’ll learn
volumes about your own
sexuality and how to cause
your own orgasms — which
is better than just lying back
and hoping for it.

Be warned: By the time
you finish this book, you may
be left with a sense of
confusion over which gender
does what and with whom,
but it’s an awfully nice,
liberating confusion.

Metal

Continued from page 5-1
need to dress like a slut to be
sensual. Why do you need to
look like a slut when you can be
a sexy, sensuous, classy type of
woman?”

Glam bands (short for glamour)
is metal that is based on image,
whereas the thrash bands are
based more on pure sound.
“Thrash is more political. Metallica
does a song called ‘Eye of the
Beholder,’ which is all about
censorship. It’s more in touch
with the world and less concerned
with the lower abdominal area,”
said Gottfried.

Bielich thinks that thrash is “a
lot heavier, with more emphasis
on bass and drums. A lot of it is
faster. The doom and gloom is
thick and sludgy.” Bielich’s
“death” metal band is an extreme
form of thrash with morbid topics.
Generally it has heavier guitars,
bass and vocals, and most of its
material is tongue in cheek.

The metal shows that Gottfried
and Bielich do on WPTS vary
widely from other metal—format
Pittsburgh stations like WDVE.
“It’s a lot heavier and a lot less
commercial. The stuff we play
you won’t see videos for. I
concentrate more on the
underground stuff that will get
maybe 10 people into the [Electric]
Banana,” said Gottfried.

“We cover all kinds of metal —
like thrash and death metal —
that isn’t easily acceptable to the
radio public,” says Bielich.

Both women like the thrash-
and death—metal sound, but
Bielich, a music major focusing
on electric bass and jazz studies,
is “really into Steve Vai and Joe
Satriani; both are guitarists.”

Gottfried says, “At first I hated
the thrash, and now it’s grown on
me, and I love it  Metallica,
Megadeath, Anthrax — anything
that’s harder.”

Both women would like to
continue in the music business
after they graduate from Pitt. “I
want to play in a band and see
the world from a band-tour
aspect,” said Bielich. Gottfried
plans on attending graduate
school and working as a producer
eventually.

The Metal Zone can be heard
on Sundays 3 to 6 p.m., and the
Metal Overnight is 1 to 6 a.m. on
Sundays as well.

border line techno—industrial
noise, sort of a combination of
the hurdy—gurdy man and
Ministry; lots of synthesizer stuff.

His socially conscious lyrical
style has reached an an all time
nasty level. Oust check out the
tasty cover art!) Rollins hangs on
to his trademark confrontational
approach, using a combination
rap/speaking style to bellow and
bitch about our current state of

affairs. Even with all the changes
Rollins is still able to rouse fury
and raise your adrenaline level.
One interesting note is
Wartime’s cover of the Grateful
Dead tune “FranT€Iin’s Tower.” I
doubt if we’ll soon see Hank
wearing tie—dies, smoking pot
and hanging outwith the Dancing
Bears, but it makes me wonder if
he isn’t softeningjust a little as he
ages.
