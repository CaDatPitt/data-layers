‘Do Not Specialize
Too Early,’ Dean
Crawford Advises

New College Head Tells Students
To Get Broad View Of All
Fields, Then Concentrate

‘_.

The function of a College in a Uni-
versity and the position of the Col-
lege man in society were outlined by
the new dean of the College, Dr. Stan-
ton C. Crawford, formally introduced
to students of that school Wednesday
morning. .

At a special assembly in Memorial
Hall, the College Association present-
ed Dr. Crawford through Charles B.
Holstein, ’36, assembly chairman.

The American liberal arts college,
the speaker said, is different from any

other institution in the world. - It has

developed and has been expanded to
meet peculiarly American problems.

The College of Liberal Arts here,
said Dr. Crawford, is not only the
largest unit of the Universitybut also
the oldest. Founded in 1787 as'Pitts-
burgh Academy, the College will be
150 years old in 1937, and the 150th
year of classes will begin next fall.

Decrying the lack of social ease
prevalent among many technically
trained men, the speaker called for
greater variety of study in the col-
lege before specialization begins.

“Know how to think, how’ to talk,
how to be interested in and familiar
with things outside your limited spe-
cialized ﬁeld, how to tell‘ wrong from
right, pretense from sincerity, char-
latans and politicians from states-
men,” he declared. .

It is the college, he explained,
which can best inculcate such abili-
ties. By covering broad surveys of
civilization and wide sections of hu-
man knowledge, the College can show
a man what has gone before and what
to look for in the future.

The real functions of the college he
listed as: (1) to avoid early and too
narrow specialization; (2) to aid the
-student to gain, early in life, the
greatest possible use of his mental
powers; and (3) to help the student
live a broad, interesting, and enjoya-
ble life.

In college, he declared, students
come in contact with the best minds
which in turn stimulate one to greater
achievement.

In making his address,_ the dean in-
vited the 400 or more college students
to brave the inconvenience of the phy-
sical layout of his office and “come in
and get acquainted.”

News Style Show
Succeeds Again

Models Show Usual Savoir Faire;
Students Win Hosiery, Ties

Style shows come and style shows
go. The latest one came at 2:37
o’clock and went at 6:04—not exactly
as Ron prophesied in The Pitt News,
but close enough. .

There was nothing out of the ordin-
ary about its coming or going (as Ron
also foretold), except perhaps that the
raffling came off smoothly, without the
slightest tinge of collusion,

Business Manager Ellis Tumpson re-
fused to consider Gene -Burkhart’s
winning stub because Burkhart is a
member of The News staff. That was
all well and good with Burkhardt; the
ticket belonged in the ﬁrst place to
Jerry Rosenblatt, circulation manager
of this paper. Jerry picked the wrong
man, that's all.

The gift pairs of hosiery — from
Wise’s, very nice of them—went to
Virginia Childress (No. 37'7), Reva Nei-
man (411), Elizabeth Young (321), and
Helen Elinoff (324), Leonard's Men’s
Shop’s cravats were won by George
Bott (141), John Dom (113), and Wil-
li_am McLaughlin (77). In the hustle
of the drawing their school and class
weren’t discovered, but one of them
was a “ringer,” you may be sure.

As for the models—they were more
than up to expectations. Some of the
ﬁrst-time men and women were a lit-
tle nervous, but it was great fun for
the kiddies, anyhow. And so was the
ﬁrst show in the dim past. And the
ones after that. As usual, there were
more than 1,000 students present.

This show will go down in history—-
and The Pitt News ﬁle-——as continuing
the tradition.—R. S.

NorWay’s League
Delegate Speaks

Parliament President To Feature
Fourth Hour Assembly Tuesday

The Chancellor of the Uniersity, Dr.
John G. Bowman, will preside at the
special assembly called for next Tues-
day at which Norway’s chief states-
man will speak.

Mr.’ Carl Joachim -Hambro, presi-
dent of the Norwegian parliament
since 1926, and Norway's principal
delegate to the League of Nations, is
expected to discuss the workings of
the hard-pressed League from the in-
side.

The assembly will take place fourth
hour with all University classes dis-
missed at that time.

Musical interludes before and after
Mr. Hambro’s address will be furnish-
ed by 50 pieces from the University
orchestra under the direction of Mr.
Lee M. Lockhart, director of musical
activities.

Since 1919 Mr. Hambro has been a
member of his cou11try’s parliament,
and his position today as president.
ex-officio prime minister, virtually
places him second only to the King in
his nation’s aﬁairs.

No deﬁnite subject for Mr. Ham-
bro’s talk has been disclosed, but
it is thought that he will call upon his
experience in League of Nations mat-
ters for the past nine years to speak
on Europe’s—and possibly the world’s
—leading question today:_ the League
and its effectualness.

Mr. Hambro’s trip to this country,

- during which he"will' speak~at‘rou‘r-o’r-

ﬁve universities, is under the auspices
of the American-Scandinavian Founda-
tion.

Bernard C. Clausen, pastor of the
First Baptist Church. on Sunday at 8

YMCA luncheon groups and his ad-
dresses during Freshman Week.

In his sermon Dr. Clausen will point

football schedule can be compared to
the life of an individual.

“The big games in every football
schedule are the games with the most
diﬂicult opponents,” he stated to a re-
porter.. “Similarly the victories worth
living in life are those victories
which test every atom of strength and
ingenuity.” '

As part of the sermon,‘ there will“

be an informal discussion period that
will be carried on by the students and
the members of the congregation.
Immediately following this there will
be an old fashioned “sing” along with

Harvard’s 5-Foot Shelf Almost
Stopped At 4, Artist Reveals

 

By Edwin H. Beachler

After a six-year absence, HE blew
in again . . .

HE, with the gray hair, stooped
shoulders, crooked nose, protruding
upper teeth, and unpretentious brief
case, crashed the campus fraternities,
Tuesday, for a ﬁve-day stay.

HE is Prof (self-styled) Charles
Pape, the -“world’s greatest living
artist” (again the self-style), fresh

from new triumphs in the mid-west
and most recently, Western Reserve.

“Pap” opened his 41st year of cam-
paigning in September. College
campi throughout the country have
listened to the tales of this Baron
Munchausen II.

Six years ago he “took Pitt by
storm,” again in his own words, with
his old stories concerning the “world’s
greatest artist.” Tuesday, it was the
same “golden hand,” and also “golden
tongue,” operating in Pitt fraternity
houses that performed in the past half
century.

Painting more portraits than any
artist who ever lived, Pape still main-
tains that “Whistler was punk. He
couldn’t get anybody but his mother
to paint.” The Goulds and Vander-
bilts still “freeze their ears waiting
in line for a sitting.”

William Randolph Hearst, Jr._ has

borrowed a dollar from a fraternity
man to have his portrait painted by
Pape. And the kings in Buckingham

palace wait in line so long their
crowns become rusty.
Devoting his life to glorifying

American college boys and girls, this
“great man gave up opportunities to
live in ease with his millions.” Now,
he lives easily without them. In his
own words, he “specializes in painting
voung college students because they
have no character lines in their faces.”
That's why he ranks himself above
Rembrandt, who was afraid to paint
any but very old people with lots of
character.

Vvhy, “Rembrandt and Mlchaelan-
gelo aren't even in my class (no, sir).
It took them weeks to do what I can
do in 10 minutes, and mind you, for
50 cents.”

“Young Hearst's old man even bor- '

rowed a buck from a Duke one day
(note——must have been in,’31),” he
tells you. Sousa left his band stand-
ing outside a Philadelphia music-hall
in zero weather fora portrait, with
Franklin D. Roosevelt» peering over
the artist's shoulder murmuring “It’.°
worth it, it’s worth it.” ,

When the professor's father
sketched the emperor of China, the

“We’re still selling tickets, you
know,” says Edward Shepherd, ’36,
chairman, concerning the Engineer-
ing Association Dance at the Grotto

virtually ~ unapproachable, pushed
prospective patrons aside long
enough to add, “My committeemen,
William Britton, ChE36, James

sistance.

“The dance is sure to go down in
history as another great engineer-

Hop Leader Says
‘Plenty Of Room’

Twentieth Century Club Ballroom
Holds 700, Schultz Declares

D. C. Schultz, BA, endeavoring to

clear up a misunderstanding in regard .

to the size of the Twentieth Century
Club, scene of the formal Sophomore
Hop, November 8, made this state-
ment to a Pitt News reporter yester-
day.

“We have been told that the Twen-
tieth Century Club ﬂoor is too small
to hold a dance of the importance of
the Sophomore Hop. However,
through actual measurement we ﬁnd
that the ﬂoor has 4.000 feet of floor
space for dancing. This is amplepto
accommodate from 300 to 350 couples,
In fact, the largest hotel room in the
city has only 3,500 square feet of ﬂoor
space, and this hall cannot compare
in beauty and in atmosphere with the
Twentieth Century Club rooms."
Schultz is chairman of the affair.

Arrangements, according to Schultz,
call for practically the entire club be-
ing turned over to the Hop. Two
lounges, two foyers, and an entrance
hall, lined with couches and chairs
have been reserved for those choos-
ing to sit out a dance.

“There are to be no favors other
than suede-covered programs. The
programs will mark an innovation,
ﬁrst in their covers, and second in a
circular, calendar-like arrangement of
dance numbers and partners.

Archie Bleyer’s network orchestra
will furnish the music to the “Home-
coming" affair.

On To New York-And Safely

BEGINNING TODAY, the cavalcade of Pitt

football adherents. makes its way to New

York for the game with Fordham. Two weeks
ago a similar cavalcade journeyedwestward to
‘South Bend, Indiana, and some of it fell by the
wayside.

By virtue of a kindly fortune, nothing of trag-
edy with regard to University students resulted
from accidents in which they were involved while
making that trip. It can only be hazarded how
close the balance of Fate came to falling In that
direction.

To students, who are generally not accustomed
to long-distance driving, such trips become more
than a normal hazard. Driving at night over un-
familiar roads is difficult enough, but when the
driver is fatigued from the monotony of steering
the car or from lack of sleep he faces a real
problem.

It is not our intention to discourage students
from motoring to football games. The warning 1s
merely to suggest that the drivers exercise particu-
lar care in these hurried and rollicking trips.
Extra caution will be well worthwhile if no stu-
dent fails to ﬁll his accustomed place in ‘class Mon-
day because he is holding down a hospital bed 1n
Reading or somewhere.

I Editorial Of Week I

Learn To Find Yourself

From the “Oklahoma Daily”

AN’S GREATEST discovery is the ability to ﬁnd

himself. Many times the latent abilities of a per-
son are concealed in a misty haze of doubtfulness and
fear of showing what he really is.

He who does not put in use his gifts and qualities fades
and deteriorates just as unused machinery becomes ob-
solete and rusty. Man must ﬁx his mind on one ambi-
tion and focus all his mental and physical powers toward
that goal.

His conscience is his compass, and he should never
allow indecision or any obstacle to change his course.

Multitudes have let other inﬂuences interfere with
their innate aptitude, and consequently they have become
failures or are still struggling in mediocricy.

Sydney Smith, the noted philosopher, said: “Follow
the grain of your aptitude and you will succeed; do any-
thing else and you will be ten thousand times less. than
nothing.”

Though this statement contains a powerful warning, it
is unfortunate that so many disregard it. They do what
nature forbids them to—-attempting to ﬁt a square peg
into a round hole.

Today our schools and colleges offer many opportuni-
ties for self-analysis. However, one must use judgment
in choosing his vocation. What may seem pleasant and
desirable at ﬁrst may later turn out to be a chronic
drudge.

Everyone must choose for his life’s work something
that is ﬁtted for him, and he must sacriﬁce much to gain
his objective. Success is determined by one’s capacity
to find himself.

Mahoney Reports
- Enrollment Gain

In Bank Course

Approximately 100 more students
are enrolled in the American Institute
of Banking courses in the Downtown
Division of the University this year
than last, according to a report issued
by J. Lloyd Mahony, director of the
Downtown Division and The American
Institute of Banking.

The ﬁgures to date show a total of
443 Downtown students taking the
various courses offered, by the Insti-
tute in comparison with about 350
last year.

The Institute, cooperating with the
Downtown Division, sponsors courses
in banking and ﬁnancial subjects, and
other allied subjects including busi-
ness law, economics, and accounting.
The principal courses, however, are
those in banking, and investments.

The University and Institute con-
duct the courses jointly. The former
registers the students, provides the
classrooms, and furnishes some of the
instructors. The latter prescribes the
given curriculum and program, and
in general administers the courses.

The series of courses are divided
into three groups. The ﬁrst leads up
to the pre—standard certiﬁcate, the

“The Show-Off” will take to the

faculty director of Pitt Players, and
his graduate assistant, Charles Fore-

Calling For

One Gray Overcoat

Although the weather has been
reasonably warm all week, John
McClain, BA38, is still hoping
that he'll run across his overcoat
soon.

-McClain attended the “Bizad

wearing his overcoat. When he
was ready to leave, he found an
over-size coat where he had left
his.

Says McClain, “Maybe I should
see the district attorney—he was

in the Belleﬁeld Dwellings.

At this meeting the ideas and argu-
ments brought out at previous group

tion of preparing a brief for the ques-

More About This
Fellow, Mr. Pape

(Continued From Page One.)
walls of China were constructed to
give him peace and quiet for his work.
The emperor, after crawling through
600 miles of mud on his hands and
knees, was sent back by the “second-
greatest artist in history” to bring
back two more customers. You see,
a Pape never sketches less than three
portraits at one sitting . . .

This continues, ranging from the
special street car put in for his con-
venience at his studio near Cairo.
Egypt, to the construction of the Em-
pire State Building to take care of
the crowds watching him at work in
his New York studio.

“College Humor” carried a story
concerning Pape entitled “Racketeer-
ing the Undergrads” some years ago

‘to which he replied, “I am immortal.”

Pape is the only one left of a fa-
mous trio, well-known to every col-
lege campus since 1900. “What you
can’t understand, is art” he pointed
out to comments defaming his
sketches.

Mail Pouch, the second of this trio,
rests peacefully in an asylum, near
Cleveland, Ohio, Results of his carv-
ing handiwork are still preserved in
three men’s fraternities on this cam-
pus. Daddy Marx, the third man,
died three years ago in Philadelphia.
Pape’s b_irthp1ace. Marx engraved
fraternity crests on watches for the
fraternity boys.

What do other schools think of
Pape? An article in the “Michigan
Daily” headlines this artist as the
“man who helped Elliot ﬁnish his

Harvard classics when that gentleman
reached an impasse” at the fourth
foot.

The Vvisconsin “Daily Cardinal” an-
nounced that “the Wisconsin frats are
now shaking hands with ‘an immortal
genius’.” Headline: “Baron. Munch-
ausen II Visits Vvisconsin Frats.”

“Rufus Dawes, VVorld’s Fair chief,
held open the fair an extra year for
Pape’s apperance.” How has this
great man taken his fame? Well, he
modestly claims he feels no different
now than before.

Not only has he sketched more por-
traits than any artist that ever lived
(600,-000 college students by his count
or miscount) but he also claims to be
an inventor and writer. His book
“How To Conquer the World” heads
his list in importance. -'He ﬁgures that
his patented (439941) fountain paint
brush will net him a cool three mil-
lion. “Some day, maybe tomorrow.
my 50—cent sketches will range in
value from $2,000 and on up to mil-
lions, when these rich fella’s take an
interest in me.”

His autograph books, containing
signatures of his customers in col-
leges from coast to coast, carry such
famous men as Buster Crabbe, Joe E.
Brown, Ernie .Pinckert, Tay Brown,
Red Grange, Harry Wilson, and others
in fraternity houses throughout the
country.

He likes the cold weather since he
feels better and raises his price of
portraits to one dollar. People will
pay no more than 50 cents in warm
weather, he believes.

From here, the “golden hand” moves
on to eastern schools, touching Yale,
Princeton, Dartmouth, and others.

Pennsylvania, he claims, is the
richest state for his collegiate busi-
ness.

History’s Lowest
Assessment Set

For CA Formal

At the College Association assembly
Wednesday morning, Charles B. Hol-
stein, ’36, chairman, disclosed that the
price of the coming CA Thanksgiving
formal dance will be $1.

Although tickets have not as yet,
been printed and no arrangements"
have been made for the affair, the
price stands as the lowest in Univer-
sity history for any formal dance.

Paul Keiser, ’36, president, William
Hughes, '36. social chairman, and the
cabinet made the decision on the $1
rate after the success of the informal
dance earlier in the semester at the
same assessment.

In previous years, membership tick-
ets to both College Association dances
during each semester sold for $2, but
the assessment for any one dance of
the two was also $2.

Espousing the cause of inexpensive
social affairs for College students par-
ticularly, the Association expects at
least 500 or 600 couples at the coming
formal. Tentatively scheduled for the
Grotto ballroom, which accommodates
800- couples, the dance will take place
Wednesday evening, November 27,
Thanksgiving eve.

With Apologies To Runyan
Trosen Gives You Basketball

Top Hyatts, Cheek To Cheek, Smoothies, Others Mingle
In Games As Ca-rlson, Players, Reporter Have Fun

By William Trosen I
It’s Tuesday and I’m sitting here on this hard press box bench beside my
good friend Dr. Carlson and I have my peepers glued on this second day ex-
hibition of basketball as exhibited by a yelling, sweating bunch of gangling

freshie and upperclass novices.

At least, that’s what they’re billed as.

Me, I

think they’re a bit too clever with that little ball to be classed as novices.
Yesterday I get a big kick out of watching these kids open up Carlson’s
annual novice tourney. Today I get a kick, too, but the action slows up a

little now and then.

But the boys seem to -be having a
swell time, I know the doctor is, and
so am I. After all, that’s the main
slant to the idea, so should I kick?

There’s no close game today, maybe
t-liz—1't’s got something to do with it.
Even at that, the games are all hard-
fought and the boys keep playing as
if their opponents were the Dukes
from the Bluff up here to take the
city title.

The ﬁrst game on the program today
is ‘the clash between the G-Men and
the Special Agents, in which the
G-Men try to, and do, prove that
they’re the top. The score is 33-24.
It’s the G-Men’s game all the way.
Two sharpshooting snipers, Lynch
and Scocchera, who is just a little
guy, takes the sniper badge between
them, each popping ten points.

As a follow-up to this, the So and
So boys and the Scented Smoothies
get together. It’s another lop-sided
affair, 30-16, for So and So. The game
is pretty even up until the second
half when the Scented Smoothies start
to demonstrate to the Withered Won-
ders just how a team, if in the mood
to wither, should wither.

Smoothies Not So Smooth

The Smoothies work fairly smooth
until Mr. Light leaves the game in
When the Light
goes out, the Smoothies are left en-
tirely with only their Scents in the
dark. ‘Which isn’t so good.

Winters steals the show with his
point total of 12. Not far behind is
the nice playing of a boy named Tack.
Who does most of the passing for his
team like he knows how. Rivlin, too,
handles the ball cleverly for So and
So. The standout for the Smoothies
is Lindsay, who gets his team eight
little markers.

In the ﬁnale of the day comes a
game that sounds something like a
musical production between the Top
Hyatts and the Cheek to Cheek gang.
The Cheek to Cheek mob runs up a
big lead in the ﬁrst three quarters and
the Top Hyatts’ last quarter rally falls
short. Manny Hyatt, who wears the
white tie and gloves for the ’1‘op
Hyatts, grabs himself ten points but
starts making them too late. He pops
all his buckets in the second half, and
the Cheek to Cheek get dressed sing-
ing ““Isn’t This a Lovely Day.”

That winds up the afternoon as far
as the novices are concerned. They
resume the tourney and all the fun
Thursday with the big ﬁreworks set
for Friday, with the awarding of
prizes and all. There’s a Carlson hint
of ice cream treats for the players as
the Friday highlight.

I guess I’ll be there, too.

Schricker Wants
Heavyweight Men

Lack Of Boxers In Upper Weight
Divisions Hampers Team

Lost, strayed, or stolen, some 155,
165, or 175-pound boxers who should
at this minute be the exclusive prop-
erty of Coach Jack Schricker.

Vi/‘hen Pitt met Miami last year in a
boxing match, the result would not
have been a draw if there had been
some winners in the heavier classes.
The ﬁrst four men to ﬁght earned
enough points to insure a draw, but
the heavier men did not win a match.
“There has not been a consistent win-
ner in the heavier classes for a long
time,” Schricker said. ’

Coach Schricker is therefore issuing
a Call to any Ilpperclassmen who have
passed 12 credits in the preceding
semester, and who are willing and
anxious to ﬁght to see him at any time
after 3 o’clock at the YM-YWHA gym-
nasium. Schricker is also in need of
two freshman managers who have
their afternoons free.

There will be a special meeting of
all Pitt boxers training at the YM-
YVVIHA at 4 o’clock today. Every
boxer must be present.

Panther Harriers
Clash With Butler

Olsonmen Hope For First Victory
In Dual Meet Tomorrow

 

A scrappy ba.nd of Panther harriers,
led by Red Tost, will be out to sur-
prise a conﬁdent Butler team on the
Schenley Park ﬁve-mile lake course,
tomorrow at 10:30 o’clock.

Tost has been chasing the winner
across the ﬁnish line in both meets
to date, but tomorrow, he hopes to
reverse the order.

As to the team, the scores tell the
story. Notre Dame ﬁrst nicked the
crippled Olson runners, 25-30. Then
an undefeated Nittany Lion roared
into the Schenley Park den. only to
hear its growl approach a whine as
the Staters barely kept their streak
intact, 27-28. '

Tomorrow, Pitt runs to avenge these
two tough set-backs and climb into
the win column for the ﬁrst time this
season. Butler showed power in
copping three decisions in four starts.
Michigan State, the leading cross-
country school in the country accord-
ing to Olson rang up a close 22-23 vic-
tory for Butlers lone defeat.

Pitt will enter Charley Groat, U11i-
versity record-holder in the half-mile,
Alex Leggin, George Cook, Francis
Theriault, a.nd Jack Emens, in addi-
tion to Tost.

Groat, who suffered a strained kid-
ney in the meet at South Bend, will
proba.bly compete tomorrow. How-
ever, he has not traveled the full dis-
tance over the park route since the
early workouts in preparation for the
Irish meet, nearly three weeks ago.

Leggin should be in top form to-
morrow, judging from his great ra.ce
in the Penn State meet. Alex ﬁnished
third behind Tost, placing ahead of
both Book and Downey of State. A
year ago, Book tied with Harvey to
defeat the entire Pitt sextet of Na-
tional Junior Intercollegiate cross-
country champions at State College.

.G,eorge. Cook also ran ,a creditable
race against the Nittany hill-and-
dalers, and should ﬁnish high tomor-
row. Emens and Theriault are soph-
omores with good possibilities despite
their inexperience.

Jayvees Race

Immediately after the varsity meet,
Olson will depart for Bethany, West
Virginia, with his varsity “B” squad
to help open the homecoming sports
program with the Bethany College
team, at 1:30 o’clock.

The dual meet starts previous to
the kick-off of the football game, and
terminates during the ﬁrst quarter.
Vvalmsley, Steffenino, Follette, Con-
nelly, Loiicher, Powers, Nordstrom,
Montroll, and Pfaff will represent ‘the
jayvees against the Bethany varsity.

On Monday afternoon at 4 o’clock.
the freshmen tangle with the South
Hills High School runners, showing
an undefeated record in ﬁve straight
dual contests.

Final Round Near
In Tennis Tourney

N etters Swing Partners At Dance,
Not Rackets Up At Courts

The Schenley hotel dance ﬂoor
proved more attractive to University
tennis players on Wednesday than the
Trees Gymnasium tennis courts, and
as a result, only two tournament
m_atches were completed. Captain Joe
Madden defeated his teammate, Jim-
my Thompson, 8-6, 6-4, his steady
driving offsetting Thompson’s danger-
ous slices. James Kunkle, freshman,
came from behind to defeat William
Williams, senior, in a bitterly con-
tested match, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, to complete
play for the day.

Eugene Cohen wishes all players
still remaining in the tournament to
report to the courts as soon as pos-
sible today to play off their matches.
The ﬁnals will be held tomorrow
morning as the courts are to be closed
up for the season on Monday.

The following matches must be
played today. Irvin Solow and the
winner of the Rowland \Vilson-James
Kunkle match; Joe Madden and the
winner of the Roy Heckler-John Mo-
gan match; Ralph Bald and the win-
ner of the Bill l\IcKenna-John Mc-
Loughlan match.

Novice Swimming Carnival
To,Begin Next Wednesday

On Wednesday, November 6, Patrick
J. Corr, University swimming coach,
will hold the ﬁrst of a series of nov-
ice swimming meets. Although the
main purpose of these meets will be to
promote an interest in swimming
among the younger boys of Pitts-
burgh, there will also be at least one
event in which all the swimming stars
of the district will compete.

Among the events included in the
meet on Wednesday will be a 40-yard
freestyle race for boys under 16, a
20-yard freestyle race for boys under
10, diving events, and a 100-yard free-
style race for all swimmers. The
ﬁrst event will start at 7 o’clock.

;PIii Ep Fratres
Defeat Lambda
C/ii Alpha, 21-0

Striking through the air with a bril-
liant aerial attack, Phi Epsilon Pi
tossed football grenades into the
Lambda Chi Alpha camp last Tuesday
and these exploded with such violence
that Lambda Chi fell beneath a 21-0
siege. V

Unleashing a sensational series of
forward passes, the Phi Ep Wolves
amassed the biggest point total in
this year’s competition and produced
the toui-ney’s individual high scorer
in Jack Kotler, sure-handed pass re-
ceiver, who snatched three of S01
Menakei"s ﬂings to place 13 points
beside his name in the scorebook.

Menaker to Kotler accounted for
the ﬁrst. seven points when they con-
nected on both a 30-yard touchdown
pass and a 10-yard extra point play
toward the close of the ﬁrst period.

As play was resumed in the next
quarter, Phi Ep center, Irv Sobel,
broke through the Lambda Chi de-
fense and stuck his jaw in front of a
punt. Lambda Chi recovered the
bouncing pigskin, but it was behind
its own goal line and the safety
boosted the score to 9-0.

In the third quarter Kotler gathered
in another heave from Menaker and,
behind hastily formed interference,
scampered across the goal line for the
second touchdown. Scoring was
brought to an end in the same period

State Cridders
Ruled Favorites
Over F resiimen

 

Eager for the taste of victory, a de-
termined band of 26 frosli gridders
will depart for State College tomorrow
morning where they meet the Penn
State freshmen in their annual con-
test in the afternoon.

The State frosh will be slight fav-
orites in tomorrow’s encounter due
mainly to their more impressive rec-
ord. In three games this season
State has won one, lost one, and tied
one. They lost their lone game to the
varsity 20-0, beat Scranton Keystone
Junior College, 13-0, and last week
tied \Vyoming Seminary, 6-6.

The Little Panthers have found the
going plenty stiff, losing a 3-0 game
to the Tech Plebes, and last week
dropping a 12-6 encounter to Kiski.

The players who will make the trip
are as follows: Asovitch, Fleming,
Stebbins, Cambal, Hoffman, Chicker-
iieo, Daddio, Curry, Goldberg, Lezou—
sky, Dannies, Petro, Merkvosky, Met-
calf, Kegel, Berger, Mensky, Kraeliiig,
Kling, Shea, Holley, Kosinski, Elpein,
and Vvicarius. Three managers will
also accompany the team, Barr, Cup-
pelli, and Marquis.

The team will leave Pittsburgh
about 7 o’clock tomorrow morning by

bus and will return immediately fol-
lowing the game.

Probable starting lineup:

New York Rams Get Ready
For Invasion By Panthers

Sutherland Expects To Have Injured Players Available;
Records Of Both Elevens Show Only One Defeat

By Harry

Robinson

Pitt’s football spotlight shifts from local surroundings to New York where
the Panthers and the Rams of Fordham are all set to begin a pigskin rivalry
tomorrow afternoon at the Polo grounds in one of the outstanding games on

the national football calendar.

Coach Sutherland and company piled into sleepers last night and were

due to arrive in Gotham this morning.

Immediately after reaching the Big

City, the players were to be hustled to Rye, New York, where they will se-
clude themselves in the Westchester-Biltmore country club until shortly be-

fore game-time tomorrow afternoon.

As far as their records are concern-
ed, the two teams are evenly matched.
The Rams boast a record of four vic-
tories in ﬁve starts, and the Panthers
can point to the same standing in
their record book. Curiously enough
both teams were beaten by a mid-
western outﬁt. Fordham took one on
the chin from Purdue’s Boilermakers,
and the Blue and Gold eleven lost a
close encounter to the Fighting Irish
of Notre Dame.

Tomorrow's outcome may have an
important bearing in the aspirations
of both teams for Eastern football
honors this season inasmuch as the
two‘ aggregations are possible claim-
ants for the title. Pitt will be risk-
ing its long string of victories scored
over Eastern clubs in tomorrow’s
clash, not having landed on the wrong
side of the ﬁnal result with an Atlan-
tic coast team since 1928, when Car-
negie Tech turned the trick.

Baker, Pitt

Sabo at tackles; Nat Pierce and Vin-
ney Lombardi at guards; and Alex
Wojciechowicz at center. Paquin,
Sarno, Pierce, and Sabo are veterans,
Lombardi is a reserve from last year’s
outﬁt, and the other two linemen are
ﬁrst-year men.

In the backﬁeld, Captain Joe Mani-
aci at the line-plunging post heads
the list. Maniaci will get able assist-
ance from Frank Mautte, ﬂashy open-
ﬁeld threat, and sophomore Joe Woit-
kowski at halfbaclis, and the veteran
Joe Dulkie at the signal-barking post.

For the Panthers, Coach Sutherland
will probably revert back to the team
that took the ﬁeld against Notre
Dame, except at the end berths where
Walt Miller and Paul Shaw will like-

ly start. Mi1ler’s work against Penn
State boosted his stock several
notches.

The rest of the forward wall will
remain the sa.me with Matisi, Glass-

‘Check To Cheek’ Wins Out
In Campus Song Hit Survey

Everybody is taking polls these
days. The Pitt Institute of Public
Opinion, nee Beatless Reporter Num-
ber 3, conducted one in her spare
time, on what songs who was singing
around campus.

The inajority——by one vote-—goes to
“Cheek to Cheek,” as ﬁve people
named it. “The Gentleman Obviously
Doesn’t Believe in Making Love,”
came in second with four votes.

Gene Burkliart, C36, voted for “I'm
in the Mood for Love,” while Roberta
Nern, C36, said her favorite was “The
Gentleman Obviously Doesn’t Believe
in Making Love.” And Charles Roof-
ner, C38, and Sally Brunson, C38, both
Voted for “Sweet and Slow.” It
sounds as if they had got together on
it.

Rose Nugeiit. C38, and Ellis Tump-
son, BA36, both named “Smoke Gets
in Your Eyes,” as their choice, with
no consultation beforehand, while
Ruth Rosentlial, C38, and Martha
Bedswortli, C37, picked “East of the
Sun.”

Charles Byron Holstein, C36, said
his was “Love Me Forever,” but made
no further statement, and Israel Gold-
berg, C36, parodied on a song, and
hummed, ‘‘I Ain’t Got No Money.”

Irene Long, C38, known here and
there as “Shorty,” went for “Isn’t
This a Lovely Day.” Ruth Nickel,
C37, said she would choose “From. the
Top of Your Head,” and so did Anne
June Elmer, C36.

Charles A. Ruch, C36, wouldn’t talk,
but said his sister, Louise, liked
“Cheek to Cheek.” And P. Bernard
Fleming, C36, went stubborn and held
out for “Mad Dogs and Englishmen,”
because he likes Englishmen.

Lucy Conn, C38, tallied “Accent on
Youth,” as her favorite_ and Bob Saff-
ron, C38, marked one up for “Ooh-
ooh-ooh, Look VVhat the Moon Can
