iWanted to he Engineer

MadalynMurray Tells of Pitt Experience

by KATHY KRAUS

Miss Kraus recently had an
interview with Mrs. Ma<lal_z/11
Murray 0’H(Lz'r.—

A frustrated woman who

‘ wanted to be a civil‘ engineer

has instead become the most
famous and infamous athe-
ist in the U.S.

A native of Pittsburgh,
Mrs. Madalyn Murray O’Hair
dropped out of the Univers-
ity when she was not allow-
ed to take civil engineering
courses. The administration felt
it was an unwomanly profession.
“It was 1936 or 1937,” said Mrs.
O’Hair, “I don’t remember dates
well.” , _

Responsible for the 1963 Su-
preme Court ruling banning pray-
er in public schools, Mrs. O’Hair
has not been content with that
single accomplishment.

Calling herself an atheist and

separationist — seDal°3-l’«i0l1 Of

church and state-—she is continu-
-ing her tirade against the alli-
ance between the church and
state.

_A 17th generation American,
Mrs. O’Hair went to court in Bal-
timore, Md., when her son, Bill
Murray, now nearly 21, com-
-plained about being ostracized
when he refused to say prayers
at school. -

Her campaign for the preser-

vation of the First Amendment .

has endangered her and restrict-
ed her freedom. ‘

Mrs. O’Hair, who appeared on
KDKA’s “Contact,” told how.
nearly two and a half years ago,
her house in Baltimore was
broken into by 14 policemen and
she, her aged mother, and son,
Bill, were beaten up.

The irony of the whole affair,
she said, was that she was
charged with assaulting the po-
licemen. Before she could be ar-
rested, she and her family ﬂed

‘ to Hawaii.

One morning Mrs. O’Hair re-
ceived a phone call from a Ha-
waiian newspaper reporter who
informed her that she was in
“jail.” Mrs. O’Hair was unaware
of her “in absentia” trial in Bal-
timore. She was found guilty,
ﬁned $500, and sentenced to one
year in prison.

To guarantee her safety, Mrs.
O’Hair went to Mexico where she
met Richard O’Hair, an Ameri-

‘can painter to whom she is now

Iowa State
Sees Upturn
In Housing

A report by the housing sub-
committee of the Government of
the Student Body at Iowa State
University reveals that a survey
on off-campus housing had “sur-
prising results.” The committee
found that the building of new
residence halls has started to
upgrade off-campus housing.

A spokesman for the committee
said that as more residence halls
were built, the standards of off-
campus residences would be up-
graded in order to keep students
living off-campus. “There will be

1- competition,” he said, “to get

students to live in the houses.”
The survey will. help rate off-
campus houses that are listed
with the Department of Resi-
dence. Houses are listed or‘non-
listed. If the house is non-listed,_
it is placed on ﬁle in the resi-
dence offices.

married. When Maryland began
extradition proceedings against
her, she requested asylum in
Texas. Texas agreed and she and
her husband moved to their pres-
ent home in Austin.

A conﬁrmed atheist, she ad-
mits she is “in ignorance” about
the creation of the universe and
solar system. “I’m excited about
space exploration,” she comment-
ed. “We’ll have to reserve our
judgment until the action crea-
tion is discovered as a fact.”

Having no belief in any super-
natural power, Mrs. O’Hair be
lieves that most “so-called Chris-
tians” only “believe” a few times
a year when they attend church.

“Those so-called Christians” she
points out, have given her most
un-Christian treatment. She re-
calls the "days when Bill was
beaten up by classmates because
he wouldn’t pray in school. The
vice-principal was looking on but
did nothing. That night she pick-
ed up Bill and found him cov-
ered with blood from head to
toe.

This year Mrs. O’Hair has been
on 87 television and radio shows
and is currently negotiating with
the Federal Communications Com-
mission. She wants them to force
radio stations to sell her air time.
“I believe in asserting my inde-

Later in the interview, Mrs.
O’Hair stated that she is against
marijuana and LSD, claiming
that both make a person become
“internal” and looking inward to
find some kind of truth. “When
there is so much to be done in
the world,” she says, “One must
look outward——be external.”

Mrs. O’Hair is optimistic about
her causes. “Already_in my life-
time,” she remarks, “I have seen
the news media stop aligning
atheism with Communism.” She
must admit, however, that her
public image is one of a monster,
crank or fanatic.

Howard University Plans
Foreign Affairs Program

Howard University is seeking
interested and qualiﬁed students
for its career-oriented Foreign
Affairs Scholars Program. Ad-
ministered in cooperation with

_the Department of State, the

Agency for International Devel-
opment (AID), and the United
States Information Agency
(USIA), the program's purpose
is’ to ﬁnd and prepare able Negro
students and students of other
minority groups for careers in
the Foreign Service and _in the
three agencies.

Some 40 students will be se-
lected for the program during the
1966-67 academic year. Although
preference is given to juniors,
seniors may be chosen if they
have outstanding qualiﬁcations
and have demonstrated interest
in a foreign aﬁairs career.

Select_ed students are offered
paid internships in the Depart-
ment of State, AID, and USIA
during the summer of 1967 as
part of an intensive work-study
program.

During their senior year at
their respective colleges, juniors
may receive additional ﬁnancial
assistance from the program. Fel-
lowships, up to $4,000, are avail-
able to 25 students in their senior

year for one year’s graduate
study in foreign affairs at their
selected schools.

For further information, write

Develop Intermediate Degree

The University of Michi-
gan has taken the first step
toward the development of
an intermediate degree be-
tween the master’s and the
doctor's. Michigan has issued
diploma-styled Certiﬁcates to 164
graduate students as a formal
recognition of their having reach-
ed the stage of candidate en
route to the doctor of philosophy
degree.

“There is great need for this
degree,” according to Dean Steph-
en H. Spurr of the Graduate
School. “The Candidate’s Certiﬁ-
cate is proposed to give not only
recognition to the many students
who have completed all their re-
quirements for the Ph.D. (except
for the’ dissertation, but also to
meet the needs of students who
wish to become thoroughly ex-
posed to the subject matter of a
particular ﬁeld of specialization,

and yet who are not interested
in the type of detailed and ex-
tended scholarship required by
the doctoral dissertation.”

Michigan was stimulated in its
pioneering step by previous ac-
tion of graduate school deans of
the Big Ten Graduate school
deans and faculty representatives
of the Committee on Institutional
Cooperation had approved the
con-cept of an intermediate certi-
ﬁcate at a University of Chicago
meeting last spring.

At this historic meeting, chair-
ed by Dean Spurr, it was pointed
out that 1) there is merit in ree-
ognizing those people who reach

‘this stage of academic learning

by issuance of the Candidate De-
gree; 2) the issuance of such a
degree would give status and rec-
ognition to those known only by
.the derisive term-—all but disser-
tation—and at the same time, to
help preserve the standards of

the Ph.D. itself by reserving it
to those who can and who de-
sire to take the further necessary
step.

Dean Spurr said that under
consideration by the Graduate
School Executive Board is the
future conversion of the Candi-
date’s Certiﬁcate to the Candi-
date’s Degree. The Executive
Board suggested that the candi-
date’s disciplinary ﬁeld be des-
ignated on the certiﬁcate.

 Dull Season

r CRITICS HAVE called this
the dullest television season
ever. Political writers have
called this the dullest‘ guber-

 resemblance is not a coinci-
dence. ‘

I Both Ray Shafer and_Mil-

gthat the top TV ratings get-
i ters are comedies. Both cam-

_‘ sembled comedies.

. Not a good comedy, but a
"TV comedy. A classic like
f “The Beverly Hillbillies” or
f“Gilligan’s Island,” which
-walk the tightrope between
dullness and boredom.
 TELEVISION TAKES ad-
; vantage of the viewer by
playing on his ignorance. So

 Freedom of expression in student publications is as much a part of
the University as the Cathedral or Saga Food. It is something expected
by all and the roof would fall ‘in if the-administration ever attempted to
suppress free speech. It never has happened‘ and we are confident that the
{present administration has no desire to try.

, , But few people realize that our situation is slowly becoming the ex-
 _eption to ‘the rule. At the recent Associated Collegiate Press Convention
’-the subject of censorship came up. The frightening result of this discus-
 ion was that numerous college newspapers have been subject to various
;types of pressure from the administration of their schools.

 _ " The editor of the student newspaper at a small women's college in the
{Mid-West told this story. The Dean of Students was unhappy with a story
{__that was to be run concerning liquor policies at the school. The Dean un-
., Tabashedly went to the composing room and told the make—up editor to delete
I fspecific lines from the galley.

_ In another instance, the. administration of a Western university was .
engaged in a heated debate with the student government over dormitory
rules. The student newspaper strongly supported the student government’s
'f'st~and but in retaliation, the administration refused to receive reporters
‘from the paper. Their sources of news were badly stifled.

  

 

 

  Censor I

The same type of incidents were recounted ad nauseum.~In one in-
stance the administration threatened to cut off funds allotted if critical
editorials did not cease. In another case, aneditor was receiving pressure

_ from the Board of Trustees because of an anti-ROTC editorial.

 

It is difficult to make generalizations in such matters, but by and

large the newspapers rated “All American” had never encountered censor-
ship. It appears the best newspapers had been produced in a free environ-
ment without administrative controls.

While the University has left the Pitt News and. other publications

uncensored, it has provided us with professional guidance. The Director _of

Student Publications, experienced journalist, has the responsibility to re-
view the progress of the paper and point out its weaknesses and strengths.
At the same time she will never read copy before it goes into the paper,
avoiding any taint of control.

It is amazing that these other schools would not automatically follow

the course taken by our University. An administration that is so small and

petty that it fears its student newspaper has no business directing the fate
of an institution of ‘higher learning. The trend of censorship is something
that American colleges should have outgrown long ago. Those who would
practice such controls should realize that their actions reflect upon their

respect for basic American values and their internal maturity.

names are changed to pro-

In the same manner, the
two candidates have avoid-
ed the issues, and any new
and refreshing ideas, and
have turned to the same old
refrain that the voting pub-
lic tired of in the days of
James Polk and “Fifty-four-
forty or ﬁght.” ‘

They have made some of
the previous political loud-
mouths seem like shy, retir-
ing types by comparison.

surpassed all previous Uto-

something for nothing. His

wild and irrational.
But, that Was BPE (Be-

fore Primary Election) and-

has been totally forgotten by
allinvolved. The party lead-
ers now hail Shapp. His for-
mer wild, irrational program
has become their sound, pro-
gressive program.

SHAPP’S' FANTASY land
promises free higher educa-

tion, more money for the,

cities, more money for the
rural areas, more money for
the suburbs, in ‘short, more
money for everyone. All, of
course, without raising taxes.
No politician is ever going to
raise taxes before an elec-
tion. ..

To ﬁnance what Shapp has
proposed, Pennsylvania
would have to steal some-
thing small. Like Switzer-
land.

Shafer gave up trying to
outpromise Shapp long ago.
Instead he turned to another
old and well worn bit of po-
litical terpsichory, the smear.
He claims t-hat Shapp has
tried to smear him, smear
Governor Scranton, smear
Pennsylvania, and smear
everything else worth'smear-
ing.

WHETHER IT is true or
not, the fact remains that it
is an old cry, and one not
heeded by his audience.

What is most tragic about
the current campaign is the
tremendous amount of apa-
thy the candidates have man-
aged to spread in such a
short time. Current polls es-
timate that everyone from
one quarter to one-third of
the voters are undecided.

When television executives
gloat or rage over their rat-
ings, they fail to consider
the number of people they-
are not reaching, that is,
the vast potential audience
which is not watching their

program or any program be-
cause of the low quality.

The old plot and the old

ideas, topped ever so lightly
by new frills doesn’t inter-

Student Affairs  

VOMEN’S OF PITT’S fu-
ture are.‘ increasing daily.
Temple ‘University, another
“state - related” institution,
has proposed a '$100~million
building project with a $75
million state subsidy. The
project results from an ex-
panding student body lured
by ’I‘emple’s low in-state tui-
.. tion. Pitt will soon face the
same problem.

What will be the effects of
expansion on undergraduate
activities? A glary-eyed op-
timist will see no need to
worry. He feels the Univer-
sity is committed to a strong
undergraduate program and
state-relatedness will neces-
sitate no change. In ten

' years hindsight will be his

crutch.

A planner’s perspective
with a catalyzing tinge of
pessimism is more suitable.
Recent years have witnessed
the Berkley-syndrome in
higher education. Schools be-
come complex organizations
with vast expansion of phy-
sical plants. Most anticipated
the changes with planning

for new buildings, research .

work, and involvement of
graduate students.

FEW “ SCHOOLS planned
for undergraduate changes,
except providing more space.
There was student discon-
tent. Sometimes it was ex-
pressed 'in rebellious Sproul
plaza demonstrations. Other
times it took the form of fu-
tile attempts to reform
teaching practices through
student evaluations. Follow-

ing them -all came a deluge
of ex-post-factor explana-
tions and solutions.

Pitt has an opportunity to
use these materials. Student
affairs have traditionally
been low man on the totem
in this and other universities.
There is little research and
planning. Instead of an em— -
pirically-based philosophy as
a guide, situations are dealt
with by ad-hoc moral judg-
ments. Other universities
are adapting their student
affairs approach to new
needs.

Evidence proves that the
division of labor by sexual
lines is not adequate. Other
universities of comparable
size revolve around a strong
Dean of Students with a
well - trained administrative
staff. Pitt’s system needs re-
vision.

POLICY QUESTIONS are
dealt with’ by rese’arch-ori-
ented staffs. They ascertain
pertinent data, an adminis-
trative guideline is set, and
students are not left to ﬂoun-
der.

Most important in the use
organizational techniques
throughout the Student Af-
fairs Area. Pe_nn State re-
cently accentuated this need
by creating a division. of stu-
dent affairs research under

its Vice-President of Student

Affairs. The emphasis on ad-
vanced planning and research
are fruits of the otherwise
fruitless Berkley - syndrome.
Pitt must recognize the evi-
dence.

Thuss Defends
Fee Allocations

Editor, Pitt News:

As a member of the Allocations
Committee perhaps I should ig-
nore the accusations by a grad-
uate student in Monday’s Pitt
News. It is better for a commit-
tee of this type to remain above
the politics of campus life, but
in this particular case I feel a
few points need answering.

The question was asked, “Can
the committee point to any stu-
dent organization which is both
presently subsidized by an activ-
ities fee and is the focal point of
widespread graduate students par-
ticipation?” The Allocations Com-
mittee is held by its policies and
procedures to allocate funds only
to recognized student organiza-
tions. At the present time the
University does not recognize
graduate student organizations
and, therefore, any request that
have come from such groups have
to be turned down.

The University Recognitions
Committee meets in a few weeks
to discuss this question. If the
decision of the committee is to
recognize graduate organizations,
then the Allocations Committee
will review these requests from
graduate organizations regardless
of whether graduate students do
or do not pay an activities fee.

I do not feel that it is neces-
sary for me to repeat the ration-
al the committee gave for its de
cisions. The student government
meeting was open to anyone who
cared enough to give his or her
time. Each allocation was re-
viewed carefully by Student Gov-
ernment.

We are a committee to allo-
cate funds to the organizations on
campus which show a need for
such funds. We would not be do-
ing our job if we gave money to
any group that asks for it, and
we would not be doing our job if
we let Homecoming fail as it has
in the past.

If there are students, graduate
or undergraduate, on this campus
which feel that the Allocations
Committee has not been doing
its job then my suggestion to
them is to come to the Student
Government meetings in which
allocations are discussed and lis-
ten to the rational of the com-
mittee. If these students have
time to write a letter to the Pitt
News then they have time to ﬁnd
out the facts.

Student . Attacks
MDC Allocation

Editor, Pitt News:

After reading last Friday's is-
sue of the Pitt News, in which
appeared an article on the ac-
tions of the Allocations Commit-
tee, I was appalled and abashed
and feel that it deserves com-
ment. Yes dearhearts of under-
graduate fame, it is about time
to take a critical look at just
what beneﬁt is being received
from the activity fee. Well, ob-
viously, it is not going to Home-
coming because they anticipate a
sell out, which should please re-
turning alumni, and anyone else
who does not survive the riot
when the tickets go on sa1e.MDC
also received $0, which I assume
is not to be confused with noth-
ing.

They only wanted to put on a
free concert with the Lettermen.
But-alas and alack,=_‘someone did

than men, which is an interesting
point in it self, but I digress. Wm.
Pitt Debate Union received $3,-
700, which friends of the aca-
demia world I have found is for,
in part, a trip to Europe for sev-
eral of our ﬁne debaters. This
program will indeed beneﬁt the
mass student? ? ? Well, as one
can obviously see, beneﬁts for
the mass student are abounding
left and right. Indeed, it is about
time to descend from the cement
towers and start pounding on the
tin ears of our great white lead-
ers and demand a direct bene-
ﬁt and responsible action on both
parts of the organizational lead-
ers and our infamous Allocations
Committee.

Dorm Weekend

Letters to the Editor

past, with the exception of Greek
Week and Winter Weekend, the
winter trimester has often proved
socially lack-lustre and boring
for the majority of students.
Your decision assures that it will
remain that way.

Not only was your refusal a
ﬁasco, but your reasons for dis-
allowing the allocation were pure
nonsense. Wake up! Stop quib-
bling over who has the right to
plan what at this University and
exhibit the intelligence and fore-
sight to recognize a potentially
good idea on its own merits, no
matter WHO proposes it. Only
the narrowest of minds cannot
reach a suitable compromise.

Mr. Thuss of your committee
“We look very
selﬁshly to see what will bene-
ﬁt the students who pay the ac-
tivities fee.” This statement bears
the strong odor of hypocrisy in
light of your recent decision.

 Senior English Major
   Works as N.Y. Ad Man

 

by LIZ CIAVARRA

Comet really does get out
those stains, and Bruce Mar-
tin, a senior English major,
can prove it. During the past
summer he worked for MP0
Productions, a commercial
ﬁlming agency in New York.

Martin served as an assistant

_ , production manager for the ad-

vertising agency, drawing on a
previous summer's experience in
the ﬁeld. His work involved set-
ting up time schedules for com-
mercials, getting cameras, set di-
rectors, hair stylist and makeup
artists for the scenes..

MPO productions handled such
accounts as Oldsmobile, Ford
Truck and every conceivable
household cleanser.

Someone does get payed for

7 staining all those sinks for the

Comet, Brank X scenes.

.“It‘s a crazy world,” said
1 Martin as he described the little

if  -man putting various tea stains on

rows of sinks. After each sink
was sufficiently grimy, they would
then be tested to see if the prod-
uct could handle it.

And what about the woman
who takes the plate out of the

’ ‘,0 suds in another 'I‘V commercial?
', She sometimes has to practice

her act for four straight hours
in order to get the right eﬁect
for the directors.

Volkswagen was another cus-

ing a layout for Volkswagen was
quite an elaborate ordeal,” said
Martin. “One scene required to
be set on one stage which ran
about the same length as Schen-
ley Hall. Models were placed on
buckets of dry ice and smoke
machines puffed in the back-
ground.

“After all this trouble and ex-
pense,” said Martin, “the-set end-
ed up being built on overtime be.-
cause someone put things oﬁ too
long. Some set workers earned up
to $400 a day because of over-
time.

Martin said that all the people
in high positions have ulcers and
most of them also have terrible
tempers. “They say the advertis-
ing industry is a hard field,” he
continued, “but its even worse.”
Fortunately, the money and chal-
lenges are great.

Bligh Ships at Schenley

With Track, Not Bounty

By Tom Sacks
SportsiEditm-

Did you ever wonder what really happened to Captain

Bligh of the Bounty? Finding himself isolated intthe South c

Seas, Bligh somehow directed his small boat into the Gulf

of Mexico, up the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, and somehow
managed to run ashore just recently on Schenley Park in

the great city of Pittsburgh.

His long journey didn’t mellow Bligh’s stern character,
but it did teach him a little bit about human nature. Capi-
talizing on this wisdom of a century, Bligh decided that

   there just wasn’t that much future for Ship-
ping in Schenley. So he threw away his
compass, changed his name and applied for
a job as coach at the University of Pitts-
burgh.
The Athletic Department, which is, of
' course, never slow to realize a good thing
, p when it sees it, hired this man who called
‘  himself Jim Banner on the spot. His first
‘ chore was to turn a rather motley crew of
cross country runners into shape. And after only six weeks
it appears that this old man of the sea has succeeded.

Along the way there was a lot of hard work, a lot of
sweat and tears, and a few muffled complaints. But Ban-
ner appears to have emerged on top of this one. What he
has to show for it is an impressive 4-2record. The only win-
ning record among the Fall teams.

Serving under Banner is no merry trip spiced with rum.
He’s a coach who knows what it means to win and knows
what it takes to win. And a track coach’s job is a little
harder than just saying, “Run 20 miles today.”

“The thing about Banner’s.workouts,” conﬁdees Frank
Handelman, “is that he runs us in a logical pattern. Every-
thing is keyed perfectly toward the upcoming Saturday.”

Handelman is the Billy Budd of Banner’s crew. -He just
never complains. Two yveeks ago, he broke the Schenley
Course record by nearly 22-seconds. And when you’re run-
ning up and down bills, 22 seconds is alot.

“But it really didn’t take that much effort when I broke
that record,” says Handelman. “That’s how ready I was.

“Everything is better when you’re in shape. Cross coun-
try can‘ ‘be beautiful when you are. I’ve always thought that
distances were more rewarding than sprints, because when
you win you know that you’ve really worked for it.”

As far as Frank is concerned, the worst thing about
distance running is thinking about it. And this is where
Banner comes in. *

“He knows h-ow to handle us,” continues Handelman.
“He knows what to say; when to get us mad; and how to

    

  

  
   

I get us up. He’s a great psychologist.”

But Handelman has an advantage. Even though this
is Banne1"sifirst year as head coach, Handelman already
knew what to expect. He was recruited out of a high school
in Cleveland by Banner and had run under him when he was
interim coach two years ago.

,For Ken Lawton, a sophomore, everything was rather
frightening at first. As Lawton explains it, ‘he is running
12 miles a day in faster time than he used to run his eight
miles daily in high school. _

“They warned me how rough he was, but I didn’t be-
lieve them and I’ve been paying the hard way,” says Law-
ton. “It’s not that I’m afraid of Banner. I just respect him
an awful lot now. 

“When I come back from practice I’m beat. I’ve got a
midterm tomorrow. But when I come ‘back tonight, I'll just
go to sleep and wake up early tomorrow and try to study. I
need my scholarship to stay in school and it really keeps
me going.”

Handelman understands Lawton’s situation because
when he was a soph be used to argue about the work too. “I
wasn’t willing to work then either. Ken’s had a hard time
adjusting. .He’s never run this hard before, but he’s coming
around now.” _    .__ __ _  

Banner obviously has a " ‘ "  "
way of getting runners to
give everything they have
for him. Handelman has.
Frank sees the beauty of
running distances. And he
knows what it’s like to feel
satisfaction in seeing hard
work pay off. Lawton will
probably have that same
feeling very soon.

In the meantime, Ken
sums it up with, “If he
thinks we c‘an_do it, I have
confidence that we can even
.. though we’ll_ probably . set

Call them _the_ Baby Bulls, the Blond
Bombers,‘ "or even the Panthers’ answer to

Gemini. Dynamic Duo might be stretching
it a bitt too far. But color Mike Raklewicz and
Joe Jones the Panther backﬁeld anyway.

The season started with Raklewicz running as
fullback in the “I” and Dewey Chester at tailback.
Jones backed up Raklewicz as the second string
fullback. I

When Chester injured his leg, Jones was moved
into the vacated. tailback slot. And he’s been a
tailback since.

Ideally the talkback should be the team’s best
runner. Garrett Ford of West Virginia and Floyd
Little of Syracuse spark their respective balllclubs
from that position.

Ideally the fullback should be the team’s best
combination of blocker and runner. John Piscorik
and Larry Csonka can either .lead a play as block-
ers or run their own series to take some of the
pressure off their more heralded teammates.

The Panthers’ situation is unique. Raklewicz .

and Jones can do both and if it weren’t for uni-
form numbers, it would be tough to tell them
apart ' _

“We -really could switch at any time,” says
Jones, “except that I’m out of practice at fullback.”
He notes that he’s a tenth of a second slower than
Rak in ‘the 40 yard dash; Raklewicz says Jon-es
probably beats me in the 100 by a tenth of a
second. i ~ P ‘ 7
Both ballplayers stand 5-11 and ‘weigh 200-205
pounds. "Both are juniors, but Raklewicz has a
slight edge in experience. “I barely got my letter,
by .-one minute I think,” he recalls.

Now one of them can’t do anything on the foot-
ball ﬁeld without the other one involvediin the
action. “I block for Rak and he blocks for me,”
Jones explains, “Although he usually does more
to help me than I do" to help him.

“In the Army game I let him down by missing

 

 .7,“ e-.  K _  ., , .
FULLBACK MIKE RAKLEWICZ heads for the
open ﬁeld against the Cadets. Rak can either run
or block as the fullback in the Panthers’ “I” for-

mation.

time, every time I made a good run, when I looked 
to see who threw the block that sprung me, there : 
was Rak. On my -end run’ for the touchdown 
against West Virginia, Rak lead the play into the 1,
end zone. On each longkickoif return, Rak’s block g
did it.” . ‘ ( . ;. i_

Jones has made two runbacks for over 50 yards. 
In both, cases he was caught by a defender who

hadgthe angle on. him in the race to the goal line...‘ 
“I feel guilty about not going all the way,” he I,
says;-"Maybe if I had more speed . .  . . '" - _ ,

Straightaway speed is not the problem has much - _ 5
as the knack to use the speed as a halfback.__ “I 
try to run over people on kicko-ffs and end sweeps
instead of giving them a hip fake or something;
like that,” Jones berates of himself. '*  .

“Running around end ,is new to me," he adds. 
“It’s easier to run up the middle with only one
hole to hit.” Strangely Raklewicz, who’s the i’ull- 
back, prefers to run .outside. I ‘ _

The Panthers try to set up their running game 
by going up the middle, then around the ends," 
and then inside the tackles. “We’ve "evened up the» ‘if;
ball carrying,” says Rak. “At the beginning of . "‘
the year the tailback carried most of the time.
Of course, he’s the main runner in the ‘I,’ '

“But then I began to get the ball more often so
.that the defenses couldn’t key on the tailback.” ,;.l_f
The strategy worked for Rak and the Panthers. He  15
won the MVP-in the West Virginia victory. ' ‘L

i ‘ Both players have thehighest regard for each  B
other. “Rak has perfect balance,” says Jones. “He’s 5..
built to be a. rlmner.” ‘ . '

Raklewicz says that even if‘ Dewey hadn’t got-
ton hurt, “Joe would still have played at tailback-.-‘
He’s a good one.” 

Jones is also an optimist. “I'm the guy ‘.who
says the glass is half-ﬁlled, not half empty." Here’s:
an optimistic thought. In addition to those‘ other 
nicknames, wouldn't it be a nice change of pace":
to be able to call them “touchdown twins”? 4

by MIKE BROURMAN

From the corner, Lou CePane¢
booted a perfect crossing pass to-
ward the goal. Len Harmon leap-
ed, trying to head it in, but
“goalie” Sal Tavares outreached
him and batted it away. “You
butcher!” shrieked the outraged
Cepanec. “My moment of glory,
gonel” cried Harmon.

Just as baseball pitchers pride
themselves in their hitting, soc-

’ cer goalies pride themselves in

their scoring ability. Cepanec and
Harmon are no exceptions. They
have a running battle in practice,
both physical and verbal, over
their respective scoring prowess.

The battle continues into the
classroom, French IV to be speci-
ﬁc, where answering a question

counts as an all important P0int-

“I’m ahead 7-2,” gloats Harmon.
‘‘That’s only because I slept

" through three classes,” retorts

Cepanec. “And the only reason
the scores are so low is that we
have one girl in the class who’s
the original Brownie. She an-
swers everything.”

“But when we see an opening
we take it,” adds Harmon.

Their major competition, how-
ever, comes on the soccer ﬁeld.
For. Cepanec, soccer is a late
happening. He played football,
basketball, and baseball at Bell-
vue High, but never saw a soc-
cer game until coach Leo Bemis
invited him out for the team last
year, after observing him in in-

I - tramural sports.

On the other hand, Harmon
has played soccer since ninth
grade, and Bemis scouted him in

high school at Monongahela and '

convinced him to come to Pitt.
Harmon let slip the fact ‘that
he wants to become a minister,
and this was all the opening Ce-
panec needed. “He sure doesn’t
play like any minister. He’s as
mean as hell in the goal. '1‘here’s
none of that ‘Do Ilnto others’

' stuﬂ.”’

Harmon defended his play by
countering, “Although I do be-
lieve in Christian principles, I
believe you should play as hard

as you can, and if you can get

away with something, you try it.”
During this eloquent plea, Ce-
panec broke into laughter.

“I try to be nice to the guys,”
said Cepanec, “but if it’s ever

him or me, I’m going to try and
kill him. There are so many
chanches where he can really get
you.”

The conversation turned to de-

LEN HARMON
Terror of French IV

fense, and Cepanec ended it by
saying, “The biggest thing is
successful ‘defense is talk.” If
that is true, the Pitt goal should
be safe for the rest of the year.

Frosh Down
Kent Booters

The freshman soccer team re-
mained undefeated by downing
Kent State, 5-3, last Saturday, as
three of the frosh booters di-
vided all of the scoring among
them.

Center forward Bob Trexler
led the frosh with two goals and
two assists. Left wing Ramon
Kyshakevych tallied twice, and
rover Bob Quinlin added one
goal and three assists.

University Mail Service

Staff Handles 150,000 Pieces of Mail Daily

by BERNI McLEOD

Delivering more than 150,-
000 pieces of daily mail to
their rightful owners is quite
a job for the University Mail
Service. Yet, mailmen are known
to be a dedicated lot. Twenty-
two people, working in shifts
from midnight until 8 p.m. ac-
complish this every working day.

The Mail Center, once located
in the Cathedral basement is
now on Henry St., several blocks
away. Several years ago the Uni-
versity business mail, which the
Center handles exclusively, be»
came too voluminous» for the
small quarters.

All mail, intended for Univer-
sity offices, is picked up ﬁve
times daily from the Downtown
Pittsburgh Post Office, and six
shipments of out-going mail are
made. According to William L.

Hopkins, superintendent of Uni-
versity Mails, about ten per cent
of the incoming mail is improper-
ly addressed and undeliverable
without considerable searching.

Hopkins, who several years
ago was superintendent of mail-
ing requirements with the US
Post Office, came to the Universi-
ty after they asked his advice on
how to handle the ever increas-
ing mail volume. At that time he
suggested the separation of stu-
dent and business mails to pre-
vent unnecessary delays in de-
livery.

“We decided that it would be
best if the students had a dis-
tinct address and from this came
‘3955 Forbes Ave.’ You will note
that there is absolutely no men-
tion of University of Pittsburgh.
This prevents student mail from
being sent over here to Henry
St.”

IN A PUBLICITY stunt for Derby Day the sisters of Sigma. Delta
Tau converted a Quad tree into a Derby Bush.

Association of Women
Deans Attend Meeting

About 200 women deans and
counselors from colleges, univer-
sities, and high schools through-
out Pennsylvania are expected to
attend the 46th Annual Conven-
tion of the Pennsylvania Asso-
ciation of Women Deans and
Counselors. The convention will
be held tomorrow through Sat-
urday at Bedford Springs Hotel,
Bedford, Pa.

Keynote speaker for the three-
day event will be Dr. Catherine
E. Reiser, professor of history
and political science at the Uni-
versity’s Johnstown College.

Dr. Reiser will speak Friday
at 10 a.m. to the general session

on the theme “A World of Chang-
ing Values.” A

A University graduate and rec-
ognized authority on the Soviet
Union, Dr. _Reiser has traveled
extensively abroad. Earlier this
year, she was "a member of the
faculty of the Seven Seas Divi-
sion of Chapman College, serving
as a professor of world culture.

Seven Seas is literally a ﬂoat-
ing campus. The spring semester,
of which Dr. Reiser was a part,
consisted of a 110-day study of
four continents, which involved
55 days of formal classroom study
at sea and another '55 days of
tours and ﬁeld trips.

“We are attempting to give
both the University offices and
the students the best possible
mail service,” said Hopkins, “but
to do this we need cooperation.

“Recently we allowed unad-
dressed mail from approved Uni-
versity organizations to be put in
the student ,mail boxes. We
thought we were providing a

 
   

~'-.

worthwhile service. Instead, after
each day we found the letters
torn up in tiny pieces and thrown
all over the Student Mailroom
ﬂoor. This is ndarn-right rude.

“We can only help when others
help us,” he continued. “We hope
to provide the University with
ever improving mail service as
the years go by.”
