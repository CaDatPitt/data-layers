Panther Sailing Club hits Lake Arthur for its maiden voyage

Gideon Bradshaw
Stqff Wrz'ter-

Like any sailor, Vincent Mattiola,
president and self-proclaimed ad-
miral of Panther Sailing Club, enjoys
telling stories.

Once, he said, on Barnegat Bay
in Newjersey, he managed to reach
22 knots on a sailboat —— about 25
miles per hour — before he heard
rattling from different moving parts
on the boat and saw the boat’s mast
begin to bend.

“I thought this whole boat was
going to explode,” he said, as he
held the boat’s course steady in the
middle of the lake.

Mattiola related the experience
while maneuvering a 16-foot Hobie
catamaran, which he owned until
he donated it to the club at the be-
ginning of the academic year. Last
Saturday, he and 34 other members
of Panther Sailing Club, a new group
for Pitt students who enjoy sailing or
wish to learn about the sport, trav-
eled 50 miles north of the city to
Moraine State Park for their first
event.

The group met at 10 a.m. to drive
up to the park’s Lake Arthur, where
members spent the day picnicking

and trying their  at sailing be- I

fore leaving in the early evening.
Both novices and experienced sail-
ors attended.

Mattiola, a neuroscience ma-

jor in his junior year and the club’s »

founder, spent the day piloting the
catamaran —— currently the club’s
only boat — taking two club mem-
bers out onto the lake for trips that
lasted between 30 minutes and an
hour.

As soon as the cars full of eager
students arrived,_ Mattiola and sev-
eral other members pushed the boat
trailer from the parking lot where.
he stores it to the launch area on
the lake’s shore.

Mattiola and Alexa Stango, a
sophomore psychology and Span-
ish major, wasted no time taking

..the_boat’s controls, sailing it from

the unpaved launch to a section of
the shore where other club members
had claimed a picnic table.

Even after the short trip along
the shore line, Mattiola, who started
sailingwhen he was 11 years old and
competed in the North American
Hobie 16 North American Youth
Championships in 2006, was al-
ready reading conditions. With
about 15 sailboats cruising back and
forth across the lake behind him, he
pointed away from the beach.

“It’s glassy right there near the
shore, but if you look out, there’s a
line of wind,” Mattiola said, refer-

ring to apoint where disturbances in p

the water indicated stronger winds.

Meanwhile, Stango, who said
that her sailing experience totaled
about three years, enjoyed the op-

NEWS

portunity the Saturday event af-
forded her. '

“It was amazing. I haven’t sailed
in about a year,” she said. “So just
being able to again was awesome.”

Several boat owners who fre-

quent Lake Arthur’s marina, includ-
ingjoe Kirk, 61, launched their boats
in order to take club members onto
the lake and teach them the basics.

Kirk, who estimated that he
has sailed for about 40 years and
founded the Point of Pittsburgh Sail-
ing League four years ago, was very
impressed with the interest level he
saw on Saturday. He said that the
club members, many of whom had
never sailed before, picked up many

of the techniques very quickly.

Kirk believed that the interest
shown by the Panther Sailing Club
would complement his own efforts
to get funding to start an instruc-
tional program in the city through
his sailing league.

Sarah Stephenson, a sophomore
who majors in engineering science
and minors in bioengineering, made
her ﬁrst- ever sailing trips with Kirk.‘
After just one trip, Stephenson
wanted to learn more.

“I would like to be able to go out
by myselfone day,” she said.

Katie Vasinko, Stephenson’s
roommate, sat beside her on the
grass near the group’s picnic table
after their voyage. Vasinko, also
a sophomore, majors in chemical

Trustees alter mission

Mahita Gaj anan
Stqff Writer

The Investment Committee of Pitt’s
Board of Trustees approved a num-
ber of resolutions at a public meet-
ing on Monday at Posvar Hall, but it
didn’t discuss in detail Pitt’s actual
investments.

The committee serves to over-
see, guide and review the con-
solidated investment pool of Pitt’s
Endowment Fund, which grew 25
percent — from $2.03 billion to
$2.53 billion dollars — in 2011. The
Endowment is mostly dispersed in

the form of scholarships, fellow-
ships, faculty chairs, instruction
and other important University
programs. About 30 members of
the committee were in attendance
at the meeting. ’

Amy Marsh, treasurer and chief
investment ofﬁcer of the committee,
brought up the new revisions and
additions to the endowment fund.

Included in the approvals were
a revised mission statement, a
statement of governance, invest-
ment objectives, and policies for
the Endowment.

The revised mission statement

statement

says that the committee would as-
sist the chief investment officer and
treasurer in investment policies and
objectives applicable to the Endow-
ment.

The committee issued the state-
ment of governance, investment ob-
jectives, and policies to make invest-
ment goals and objectives clear and
to create a framework for monitor-
ing investment performance and
evaluating investment results.

The Board approved the new
resolutions unanimously, allowing
the Investment Committee to adopt
the new policies immediately. I

Vasinko said that Stephenson
persuaded her to come after hear-
ing about the club at this semester’s
activity fair. Vasinko was glad that
her roommate brought her along.
She noted the new vocabulary that
sailing included, especially when she
took her turn at the tiller, the handle
that controls the boat’s rudder.

“It was cool. Joe had me say,
‘ready, about,’ before we took a

turn and then, ‘helms to lee,’ dur— ,

ing a turn,” she said, referring to
the procedure for tacking. Tacking
is the sailing term for maneuver-
ing the boat in such a way that wind
comes from the boat’s front at an
angle and propels it in the direction
from which the wind is coming.
Donny Risko, 67, who made the
trip to Lake Arthur from his home in
Wexford, took groups of three stu-
dents at a time on his 18-foot Buc-
caneer, which his daughter named

- “Sushi.” . —

Risko, who completed both his
undergraduate work and his mas-
ter’s degree in engineering at Pitt,

said that he volunteered his time —

after hearing about Panther Sailing
Club’s ﬁrst event from Kirk.

“A few of us who love to sail and
who have some experience sail-
ing love to share that with young

people,” he said. ..
Mattiola considered the day a
success and was already making
plans to raise money to expand the
club’s ﬂeet. While his initial request
to the Student Government Board
for $50,000 to buy four boats was
denied, the Board granted him
$1,200 during last spring semes-
ter. The money was used to reim-
burse drivers who drove the 100-
mile round trip on Saturday, and

l he estimated that the sum would be

enough to make three "or four more
trips of the same size.

He also collected ﬁve dollars
from each attendee. The proceeds
went to purchase a portable char-
coal grill for the club.'He said that,
ideally, nobody who is interested in
sailing should have to pay to learn
to sail. However, he, has set dues
for the club at $30 in order to save
money so that the club can buy a
second boat.

“We try to keep dues minimal,
but at the same time, we’re trying -to
raise money to buy a boat,” he said.

' Even after the club’s ﬁrst event,
Mattiola ﬁrmly believed the organi-
zation was on its way to establishing
a‘ high level of interest at Pitt.

“I am so happy about how today
went,” Mattiola said shortly before
dusk, as he drove_back to Oakland.
“I’m. absolutely ecstatic.” I '

THE PROFESSIONAL PUPIL V
Financial planning combats student debt

Jonathan Fischer
Columm'st

Alex is a typical 20-year-old full—time
college student with typical full-time
college debt. The menial pay he ac-
quired during his summer job "pro-
vided a tenth of what a doctor’s pay-
checkwould amount to. A_sAlex notes
the lack of zerosin his paycheck’s
“amoun ’ secﬁon, he wonders if he
will ever be able to pay off his Mount
Vesuvius-sized debt. .
ButAlexhashope. He uses several

if money-management strategies to get

a head start on his ﬁnancial situation
while still in college. And so can you.

In the midst of distractions, rang-
ing from hours of studying during
the week to hours of partying on the
weekend, Alex has an excuse, just like
you, to avoid beginning to climb the
debt mountain. But he’s prepared
himself for life after college, none-
theless.

Use less plastic

Money is always a little tight for
Alex and swiping a credit card is a
quick way to settle a large receipt to-
tal. He uses his credit card to assist
with his books as well, adding to the
debt mountain. And he’s not alone.

With the average undergradu-

_ ate carrying $3,173 in credit card

debt, according to a 2009 national
study conducted by Sallie Mae, it’s
easy for Alex to put off climbing the

mountain of debtforanotherday. The ,

same study found that a staggering 92
percent of undergraduates use credit
cards to pay for educational expenses,
with 30 percent of that number spe-
ciﬁcally allocated to college tuition.
But Alex knows he must resist. By
getting into the habit of using cash
instead of a credit card, Alexwillvery
rarely be tempted to pay for another
large amount in a quick-ﬁx fashion.
By knowingwhat your ﬁnances are
before you spend them, you, too, can

resist the urge to keep yourselfout of
further debt. ‘

Create a cost-of-living budget .

To know his ﬁnances, Alex main-
tains a cost-of-livingbudget outlining
his monthly and yearly bills. He com-
pares monies owed to his income. A
computer software program with the
ability to edit rows and columns -—
such as Microsoft Excel — proves to
be a useﬁil tool when creating a bud-

‘ get. With this budget in place, he can

cut certain costs and allocate certain
funds for his priorities — number
one being getting his mountain of
debt paid off.
Withabetterunderstandingofhis

ﬁnances and a plan in place to pay off
his debt, Alex can allocate a certain
portion of his income to a savings
account.

Establish an emergency savings

fund

There is no greater stress than
feeling that you are balancing on a
tightrope-in which one catastrophic
ﬁnancial event could wipe your ac-
count clean. Alex takes a hard look
at his budget and manages to cut
his entertainment costs by $20 per
paycheck. Alex is paid biweekly, so
this strategy saves him $40 a month.

‘The beauty of having emergency
money on hand should be obvious,
and it only takes a little discipline to
compile some. Stick to a monetary
amount or perhaps a percentage of
every dollar of income (whether this
be from a paycheck or mowing the
lawn), and you’ll be well on your way
to establishing an emergency savings
fund and possibly even opening an-
other kind of fund as well.

Invest in a mutual fund

Investing in a company through
the stock market can be risky. It’s

usually associated with a high—risk,
high—reward gamble, win which
money invested relies on the invest-
ed-in company’s performance. Alex
has had very limited exposure to the
stock market, but he knows that a
little money now can be worth more
in the future.

A mutual fund is a group of stocks
or other types of assets that are pro-
fessionally managed. While there are
afew different types of mutual funds,
they tend to usually associate them-
selves with alower-risk, lower-reward
type of gamble. The beauty of Alex
being only 20 is that he can choose a
“low-risk” mutual fund and still have
signiﬁcant gains over the course of
a lifetime. '

Typically the longer money stays
invested, the more it grows. Many
who have been investing for some
time usually come to the same con-
clusion: “I wish I had started earlier.”

Inasimple Cerliﬁcate—of-Deposit
(CD) scenario, Alex’s initial invest-
ment of $10,000 over 10 years could
be turned into $14,800 with an an-
nual interest rate of4 percent. IfAlex
had delayed investing and started ﬁve
years later, the armual interest rate
would drop to 2 percent, leaving him
with only $11,000 in ten years.

Stickingto the plan

‘ Even when Alex is a bit tight on
cash, with ﬁmds tied up in mutual
and emergency funds, he strongly
resists the urge to borrow additional
money for everyday items such as
college tuition, a car and rent. His
cost~of—living budget is his guide and
a greatstartingpoint forAlex to truly
discover what funds he has available.

The earlier you act like Alex and
stick to a newly acquired plan to start
climbing the mountain, the faster
you, too, will be able to conquer the
large task at hand.

CONCERT REVIEW

Andrew Gretchko
Sem'0r_Staff Wrz'ter ~

As the tempo of a repeating bass
note began to quicken, a conjoined,
illuminated set of the letters ‘-‘A” and
“N” at the back of the stage turned
from cloud white to deep purple. Soon
after, the kick drum of the group’s
drummer joined the bassist’s beat.

Allowing some time for the bud-
ding song to sink in, a guitar and key-
board eventually followed the initial
sounds, and Awolnati0n’s lead singer,
Aaron Bruno, began to violently bob
his head up and down.

The sold—out crowd that packed
into the Strip District’s Altar Bar last
Thursday exploded. ~

As the skulls of the ﬁve musicians
on stage rocked back and forth with
a ﬁiry most people never unleash,
Awolnation’s widely varied set began.
It was as ifthe band was in another
zone. The band members strummed
their guitars with enough vigor to
give new meaning to the term power
chord. They crashed on the symbols
loudly enough to emit the same deci-
bel level as an entire marchingband.

IMPULSE  

Awolnation gets amped up for sold-out Pittsburgh concert

They jumped high enough in the air

to warrant spots on a 2016 Rio deja— .

neiro Olympic team. “A-wol-na-u'on”
projected through the speakers in
unison with the drums and guitars,

as an electronic voice continued the ‘

chant, which was echoed loudly by
the crowd. Showtime.

Kicking off with a track reminis-
cent of the kind ofvigor found inRage
Against the Machine’s “Freedom,”
Bruno and company put the venue’s
speakers to the test. Without allow-
ing the crowd a moment’s reprieve,

the band made a ﬂawless transition 

between the ﬁrst and second songs, as
Awolnation continued its rock mara-
thon. This wasn’t just a concert — it
was an event. The energy of the Altar
Bar’s crowd reﬂected Bruno’s screams
into the microphone.

While he may have had no trouble
diving into the shoulder-to-shoulder
crowd, the group’s frontman is far
from social. ‘

“Still today, I have this problem
saying goodbye to people,” Bruno said‘
in an attempt to describe the capital-
ized band name which he helped cre-
ate. “For me, the name is a metaphor

Aaron Buno of Awolnation brought a killer performance aﬁiltar

    

Bar in the Strip District last Thursday. Sheldon Satenstein _| Senior Staff

for the whole concept of being able
to escape in your mind by listening
to music.”

From an acronym used by the
army to describe deserting soldiers
— away without leave — to the name
of one of today’s most exciting bands,
Awolnation is as hard to ﬁgure out as
its frontman, Bruno.

“I used to go to hardcore shows,
straight-edge shows and punk rock
shows back in high school,” Bruno

said. The result of Bruno’s boyhood
inﬂuences in southern Californiais a
band that lands somewhere between
the electro-pop band ﬁm. and Slayer.

As Awolnation continued with its
set, the crowd did its best to contrib-
ute to the show. During an elongated
chorus of -the group’s hit track “Kill
Your Heroes,” Bruno initiated a call-

‘and-response pattern with the crowd,

which repeated his “nah nah nahs”
with utter enthusiasm. The metal

show the audience had attended just
minutes before had been replaced by
something more reminiscent of a Fall
Out Boy concert. V ,

“We don’t think of our shows as
one genre of music, we like all dif-
ferent types of music,” Bruno an-
nounced to the crowd between songs.
He couldn’t have been more spot-on.

By the time the band got around
to playingtheirmost successful song,
“Sail,” the_audience hadbeentreated
to pop, rock, ‘metal and electronic
music, all for the price of a single
ticket. Music that relies so heavily
on computerized sound had made
the successful transition to the stage,
as the ﬁve band members gave elec-
tronica an organic sound unlike any-
thing else.

Whatever it was, it worked, and
both the band and the crowd knew it
as they gave it their all over the course
of the hour-long set.

“We’re gonna have your ears ring-

ing for hours after the show,” Bruno '

said before taking the stage. And be-
tween the guitar-shredding solos and
metal-infused rock, the crowd wasn’t
disappointed.

Running program

Rebecca Burns
Staff W riter

With the weather cooling down and a

summer coming to an end, it’s easy
for Pittsburgh runners to lose inspi-
ration and opt for an extra hour of
sleep over a morning run.

But Pitt’s campus has many great
running spots for residents, and

whether you’re continuing a sum-

mer running regimen or attempting
to ﬁgure out the meaning of a “run-
ner’s high,” running around campus
might become a new fall favorite of
yours.

There is no doubt that running .

is good for the body. Not only does
it help to maintain a, good physique,
it also makes you feel physically bet-
ter. According to Runner’s World
magazine, running decreases the
risk of high blood pressure, aids in
digestion and helps you sleep better.
A nice jog can help decrease feelings
of stress and depression.

For those who are new to run-
ning, consider starting small. The
best way to begin a new healthy habit
is to start with attainable goals that

allow room for improvement. Ex-
pecting to run three full miles on
your ﬁrst running attempt will only
cause personal discouragement. The
truth is, a mile might even be dif-
ﬁcult at ﬁrst.

But to make the physical adjust-
ment easier for new runners, there
are some great beginner workouts.
One of the best Start-up options is
Coolrunning.com’s Couch-to-5K
running program.

The name Couch—to—5K doesn’t
necessarily imply that complete
couch potatoes qualify for this fairly
intense start—up program. But for
those who have done their fair share
of couch sitting, this program will

definitely assist you in completing‘ 

 Many people, whether they
 beginners or runners who have
taken a break for a season, use this
 to get themselves moti-
vated. «

The Couch—to—5K programhelps
both new and veteran runners get
back on track. They even offer an
app for the tech-savvy runner.
' Once you’ve found a plan, when
and where do you start‘?

Luckily, the fall is an inviting
time of year for everyone to enjoy
the nice, cool weather. It is probably
one of the best times to run outside,

_ and committed runners should take

advantage of the weather.

There are many nice areas
around Pitt’s campus and through-
out the city where you can enjoy see-
ing new views while running. I like to
keep my mind busy with new terrain
and sights of t_he‘city while on my
run. The communities of Squirrel

Hill and Shadyside, as well as Frick ’

and Schenley Parks, allow runners
to venture throughout Pittsburgh
and experience different local trails.

One website that beneﬁts new
and old runners is Mapmyrun.com,
a site that allows you to create your
own routes, calculates the distance
of those routes and keeps track of
your progress.

" There are also programs such as
the Road Runners Club of America
that have a few meet—up running
groups in the area. For those still
experimenting with different run-
ning routes, a group of fellow run-
ners might help insp°ire more in-

terest. These are great groups for

meeting new people who are also ’

runners, and can help to increase
a general sense of motivation and

encouragement.

Once you have conquered the
Couch—to—5K, and you have (hope-
fully) experienced a runner’s high,
you can choose to continue with a
steady running regimen or to in-
crease your regimen and challenge
yourself. There are plenty of running
plans online and in magazines that
are made to motivate and challenge
anylevel of runner who is hesitant
to explore new trails al_on.e.—:g

The fee1.ing'al't_er’a'ﬁ1ong.run is
unforgettable. Whether you runifor
competition or as away to exercise
outside, there are great running op-
portunities in Pittsburgh for every
interested runner. V

Check out the different neigh-

borhoods of the city with friends, ‘

experiment with different websites,
and ask other runners or walkers
what they enjoy. You may even ﬁnd

your next running buddy while in‘

the process.

W/inning streak ends for Panthers at Ball State Tournament

Torie Wytiaz _
Senior Stcyff Writer

The Pitt volleyball team used fresh-'
man Jessica Boddy’s career—best
performance to salvage one win
on its weekend trip to Indiana for
the Ball State Tournament.

After falling to Ball State and
Wyoming, the Panthers (9-4) con-
cluded the weekend by defeating
Wright State, as Boddy tallied 14

_ kills in 19 attempts. .

“I have been very pleased wit

]essica’s performance this week-
end,” head coach’Toby Rens said
of his freshman outside hitter. “Her
preparation has been superior, and
it shows in the matches.”

Ball State 3, Pitt 0

After winning seven matches in a

a row, the Panthers were swept by
the Cardinals Friday night in three

sets, with scores of 25-17, 25-14 and _

25-16.

The offense struggled in" the
match, and no Pittplayer managed
to record double-digit kills. Fresh-
man Kate Yeazel led the Panthers
with nine kills.

Defensively, Pitt libero Margy
Acton had a game-high 16 digs,

lead that they never relinquished.

Ball State kept that momentum
in the second set of the match,
never trailing en route to its 25-14
victory.

In the third and ﬁnal set of the
match, the Panthers once again
jumped out to an early lead at 3-0.
However, the Cardinals battled
back to. win the next ﬁve points
and took the lead all the way to the

_ overall match victory.

Senior middle blockerjasmine
Dittrich noted that the Panthers
were unable to recover from the

‘ runs put together by Ball State.

“In the past, we have been able
to make up for runs of points by
our opponent,” Dittrich said. “That
caught up with us in a match against
a high-quality opponent.”

 

Wyoming 3, Pitt 0

The Panthers looked to return
to their winning ways on Saturday,
but they were swept for the second
match in a row by set scores of 25-
16, 25-18 and 25-18.

Errors plagued the Panthers
against the Cowgirls, who commit-
ted 20 kill errors in comparison to
their 23 team kills. Dittrich had ﬁve
of those kills on 13 attempts.

“We made too many unforced
errors,” Rens said. “Our style of
play has been consistent, but we
were not able. to do that in this
match against an experienced Wyo-
ming team.” ’

The Cowgirls set the tone in the
ﬁrst set, leading throughout.

The same scenario played out
in the second set, in which Wyo-
ming held a 13-5 lead. The Pan-
thers fought to reduce the lead to
ﬁve points at 23-18, but two kills
sealed the victory for the Cowgirls.

In the third set, the Panthers
managed only ﬁve kills, while the
Cowgirls posted 16 in their win to
seal the match victory.

Pitts, Wright State 0

Despite an 0-2 tournament re-
cord leading into the Wright State
contest, the Panthers secured a vic-
tory in their ﬁnal match with scores
of 25-21, 25-22 and 25-16.

Boddy led the way with 14 kills,

while Dittrich contributed to the
offense with 10 kills. Acton led all
players defensively with 18 digs.
The Panthers out-performed the
Raiders in kills, digs and blocks.

The ﬁrst set saw eight ties and
four lead changes, but Pitt used a
Wright State hitting error to gain
the 13-12 lead —- an advantage that
lasted for the remainder of the set.

The Panthers trailed 12-11 in the
second set, and four ties ensued
after that point. An eventual 6-0
run gave Pitt the 22-16 lead, which
it held to win the set.

Pitt earned its only match vic-_

tory by defeating Wright State in
the third and ﬁnal set. Once again,
the Raiders kept the set close, using
a 5-0 run to bring the score to 10-9.

However, the Panthers com-
pleted the 3-0 sweep with 17 team
kills in the set.

Sophomore setter Lindsey Zitz-
ke felt that her team was able to
focus its efforts in the ﬁnal match
of the weekend.

“We knew going into this match
that we had to play our own game
on our side of the net and not worry
about what the opponent was do-
ing,” Zitzke said. “We were able to
learn from our two losses and work
on not committing errors and being
consisten .”

The Panthers return to action
Tuesday, Sept. 18, when they travel
to face crosstown rival Duquesne
at 7 p.m. I

food service, entertainment and educa-

The fair is open to any industry, but
Pitt speciﬁcally “strives to invite new
employers that are in high demand from
students; this is done through gathering
data from previous career fair surveys to
compile a list of in—demand employers
students want to see on campus,” Aman-

da Sell, the special events coordinator for
the Career Development and Placement
Assistance Office, said in an email.

Sell said students have typically been
very successful at ﬁnding employment,
be it an internship, full—time or part—time
position. More than 3,000 students at-
tended the event last year, accounting for
almost 20 percent of the undergraduate
student body. ' .

Companies that attend the fair origi-
nate from all over the Pittsburgh region
and include both local businesses as well
as larger, nationwide chains. 1

Sell encourages students to‘ regis-

“Career Fair information.” Once students
register for the fair, they will receive the
fair’s directory in their email. ' ’

“Researching companies before the
fair allows students to stand out in a
crowd and network with employers,” Sell
said. “It is always important to dress pro-
fessionally and bring copies of your re-
sumé.”

Sell also recommended that students

ginning on Sept. 17. The kickoff preview

The application process resulting from
the fair will be faster than what is typical
for a job hunt. Sell said applications will
be available on site, and many employers
will be conducting on—campus interviews
in order to select students and quickly ﬁll
open positions. ' ‘

Entrepreneurship a way

to combat unemployment

Jeff Ihaza
Staff Wrz'ter

Dismal employment ﬁgures and a slowly
growing economy make the prospect of
simply ﬁnding a job after college frightful
for many students. So creating their own
must be just as daunting.

It’s no secret that students graduating
from four—year universities are faced with
the ‘increasingly unpleasant reality that
work is scarce. But even amid this dismal
climate, some students are daring enough
to take matters into their own hands.

Pitt junior Alec Davis is working on a
company of his own called Flippo. The idea
of the company centers on a mobile app
that allows students to request tasks they
want completed by their peers while on
campus. Tasks can vary from menial jobs
such as cleaning or taking out the trash to
odd jobs such as delivering food.

The app would work like an online chore
database, where students can post tasks
they need to have done and how_ much
they’d be willing to pay to have them done.
Other classmates could look at the app and

choose which tasks they could do — and a

make some extra cash in the process.

“I thought to myself, What if there was
a way for the busy people, who didn’t have
time to grab that burrito, or the lazy peo-
ple, who didn’t feel like running back out
to pick up that binder, to get in touch with
the people who were out on campus any-
way, and might want to take advantage of
their breaks in order to make a few extra
dollars,” Davis said.

Davis, a marketing major, plans to have
an ofﬁcial launch of the app in October, but
in the meantime, he has used Facebook
and the campus community to attract buzz
for his startup.

Davis doesn’t believe his young age is a
hindrance to his success, and neither does
Lani Lazzari, creator and founder of Sim-
ple Sugars. C

Lazzari got the idea for Simple Sugars in
2005 when she was only 11 years old. She
said it used to be difﬁcult to ﬁnd lotion for
her sensitive skin. Several test runs later
and Simple Sugars was born. The compa-
ny now distributes to 10 local Giant Eagle
stores in addition to orders placed online.
Lazza_ri’s advice to young entrepreneurs is
simple: do what you love.

The old phrase, “it’s not what you know,
but who you know,” might be a piece of
advice students should take to heart.

“An academic degree qualiﬁes you for
employment, but it is oftentimes who
you know that gets your foot in the door,”
Cheryl Finlay, director of the Office of
Career Development and Placement As-
sistance, said in an email. “Your personal
and professional connections can help
get your resume into the right hands,
granting you an interview that may have
otherwise been difficult to obtain.”

Finlay and academic advisors from
various departments agree that network-
ing is an important component of find-
ing a job post—graduation, and advisors
claim that Pitt offers many opportunities
for students to schmlooze with potential
employers — at both expected and unex-
pected times. .

The opportunities to network are
nearly endless, and it’doesn’t necessar-
ily mean heading out and speaking with
random people at a job or career fair.

portunity to network,” Finlay said. “Stu-T

dents should consider those individuals
that they already know, includingfamily
and family friends. However, to expand
their network, students should attend
events and programs that provide them
with exposure to individuals within com-
panies and careers of interests.”

Finlay added that students should de-
velop an “elevator speech,” in which they
can quickly present themselves to poten-
tial employers with their “academic and
career aspirations.”

And for some students, the opportu-
nity to network coincides with receiving
real—world job experience.

Christine ‘Berliner, an academic ad-
visor in the biological sciences depart-
ment, said that students who work in re-
search labs often stay with the lab after
graduation.

“For a lot of our students, it’s hands-
on experience” Berliner said. “Usually, if
they are already in the lab, a good 20 per-
cent will stay in the lab after graduation.”

She said that students can use Future-
Links, a service offered by Pitt that dis-

advice from the CDPA staff in choosing her

“I knew I wanted to do math, but I didn’t
know what I wanted to do with it,” Baillett
said. “They kind of helped me ﬁgure out
where I was going and helped put things in‘

Since then, she has returned to. the of-

“They go through [your resume] with

Last month, the CDPA received national
recognition for their work, earning a dis-
tinction from the Princeton Review as one
of the top 20 college career services de-

At the time of the honor, Cheryl Fin-

“We pride ourselves in our accessibil- '

Pittsburgh’s economic history forged in the steel mill

Pat McAteer
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

For many years, people associated the city of
Pittsburgh with the steel industry and entre-
preneurs such as Andrew Camegie and Henry
Clay Frick.

But recently, the economy in Pittsburgh has
become more modernized, and experts say it
has allowed the economy to thrive in the 21st
century. Anne Madarasz, museum division di-
rector at the Heinz History Center in the Strip
District, said that during the 1930s and 1940s,
regional leaders accounted for the eventual
decline of the steel industry by working with
local business owners to address structural

economy issues.

‘As early as the ’30s and ’40s, you began to
see leadership in the region seeing diversiﬁca-
tion of the economy as a good thing” Madarasz
said. She also said philanthropic contributions
from benefactors like Carnegie put into place
the origin of things that eventually grew into
the economy we have today by providing an
intellectual hub in the city through numerous
museums, libraries and other academic facili-
ties.

But that doesn’t mean Pittsburgh’s status
as the “Steel City” is completely gone. Pitt
economics professor Frank Giarratani, who
specializes in steel—industry economics, said

southwestern Pennsylvania still has 15 steel
mills that employ 15,000 employees in high-
paying jobs. He added that manufacturers of
steel mill equipment still operate in the city.

But, he said, the main sources of Pitts-
burgh’s resurgence reside in Pitt’s biomedical
research and Carnegie Mellon University’s
work in the ﬁeld of engineering.

Pittsburgh’s transition to a modern econo-
my reﬂects a long history of innovation around
the conﬂuence of the three rivers. Madarasz
said that prior to the 1870s, Pittsburgh’s econ-
omy revolved around the production of glass,
iron‘ and textiles because of southwestern
Pennsylvaniafs abundance of natural resources. 4

But because of Pittsburgh’s location at the
junction of the Allegheny, Monongahela and
Ohio rivers, Madarasz said, trade dominated
the city’s economy before steel baron Andrew
Carnegie’s arrival.

“Pittsburgh’s earliest economy was largely a A

commercial economy,” Madarasz said. “It was
the gateway to the West and a major trading
center.” A

Madarasz said Pittsburgh’s reputation as
the “Steel City” began in 1872, when Carnegie
retumed from Europe after learning the Bes-
semer process of creating steel, which uses
oxidation to remove impurities from iron that
is used in the steel—rnaking process.

With a goal of creating a streamlined steel
mill operation that produces a higher—quality
metal, Madarasz said Carnegie opened the Ed-
gar S. Thompson Steel Works in North Brad-
dock — the building still stands today.

“By the 18705 and 1880s, you have a Viable
steel industry producing a large amount of
steel each day,” Madarasz said.

Giarratani called the impact of the steel
industry on southwestern Pennsylvania “enor-
mous” and said it contributed to the rise of
companies such as Westinghouse in the ﬁeld
of electronics and Heinz in the food industry.
Because of the steel industry’s lucrativeness,
Giarratani said it also attracted a large amount
of human capital to the region, contributing to
Pittsburgh’s modem—day economic success.

Madarasz said Pittsburgh’s status as an eco-

. norr1ic giant carried over until around 1910,
— whenbroadeningtechnology allowed for com-

petition within the steel industry. She added
that the decline in demand lasted until 1940,
when World War II caused a massive increase
in the value ofsteel.

“Historians argue that it’s really war that
saved the [steel] industry in Pittsburgh,”
Madarasz said.

After the war, Madarasz said, the “subur-
bar1iza11'on’? of the country, or the collective
move toward the suburbs from U.S. cities, in-
creased the demand for automobiles, which
were built with steel. But Giarratani said poor
management and labor relations within the
steel industry -led to its decline during the
1960s. _ ' r
‘‘In the 1960s, when [management and
labor relations] problems were ripe, the U.S.

» faced foreign competition for the ﬁrst time,”

Giarratani said. , ,
Giarratani also said “steel recyclers,” or
companies that purchase used cars and other

. 1 items and melt them down for their steel, pro-

vided domestic competition for an industry
already plagued by foreign competitors who
paid workers less.

Madarasz said Pittsburgh, like other cities
in the “Rust Belt” —— an area stretching from
Pittsburgh to the Midwest —— suffered during
an economic downturn in the 1990s. But be-

 _ ginning in the early 2000s, Madarasz said, the
work of regional leaders earlier in the century

came to fruition.

“There has been a concerted effort to diver-
sify [the economy] and put in place the seed of
things that grow into the economy we have to-

day,” Madarasz said. I ‘

Adventure, people, travel: These are all
reasons to study abroad.

Not enough? College credit, funding,
language skills: These add further incen-
tive for the hesitant. Now, consideration
of future interviews adds to the growing
reasons to study abroad. The experience
enhances a resumé.

For some, studying abroad turns into a
semester-length party,,but the experience
helps to develop a student’s resumé in an

ENTREPRENEUR

“You’re the only one who can truly mo-
tivate yourself,” Lazzari said. The 18-year-
old Pittsburgh native who acts as the Presi-
dent and CEO of Simple Sugars recently
graduated from high school and is taking a
year off before college to work on her busi-
ness.

As with many startups, Lazzari’s busi-
ness faced adversity, and the economic cri-
sis of 2008 proved especially challenging.

“A lot of our business was based in small
shops that would carry our product. When
the economy started declining in ’o8, those
stores started closing down,” Lazzari said.

But Simple Sugars was able ‘to survive
the recession and expand business nation-
wide. V

Lazzari’s youth acted as a help and a
hindrance through the tough economic
times. On one end, she said, businesses
were more wary of ‘taking orders from a
teenager. But the marvel of what she was

doing attracted a lot of media attention,
which meant free advertisement.

James Craft, employer relations profes— l

sor at Pitt’s Katz School of Business, said
youth is an asset in most businesses.

“If you look at the most important
companies around today, all of them were
started when their CEOs were young,”
Craft said.

Craft continued to say that many young
people can identify the needs of an emerg-
ing generation that haven’t been touched
on by the major corporations.

Craft, along with most students in this
country, acknowledge that it is rather dif-
ﬁcult to enter the labor market these days,
but for many, there’s no shortage of oppor-
tunities for those with a good idea.

E And for Davis, collegegis an ideal time
for entrepreneurs to startt-heir businesses.
E “As a student, you have essentially paid
to be surrounded by driven and inspiring

‘ people, great mentors and endless helpful

resources for four years of your life.” Davis
said. “It’s like the ultimate incubator for

a professor or a lab to find a job. But, she
added, knowing people always helps.

“It’s a combination of looking through
job openings and maybe a friend or a
roommate might know of an opening,”
she said.

Like the biological‘ science depart-
ment, the Swanson School of Engineer-
ing also offers a program that offers both
experience and networking opportuni-
ties. . ‘

Maureen Barcic, the director of co-
operative education in the Swanson
School of Engineering, said the program
currently has about 800 students who
spend a year working at various compa-
nies through various ﬁelds of engineer-
ing. ‘

During this time, students don’t go

who co-oped in the past year currently
hold jobs, according to a survey conduct-
ed by the department.

Barcic said that in addition to show-
ing a company their engineering skills,
students need to show that they have a
strong personality.

“Try to convey to employers that you
are enthusiastic, have high standards
and are willing to contribute,” Barcic
said. .

Finlay said students should also at-
tend job and career fairs, such as the
fall Career Fair on Sept. 25 and Pathway
to Professions, a networking event with
alumni, on Oct. 23. '

Finlay said that networking is impor-
tant in any profession, because it is an
“important life skill.” Furthermore, she
said that there is really no limit to the
networking possibilities.

“You can never know too many peo-
ple,” Finlay said. “Be sure to take advan-
tage of all networking opportunities, in
order to build your own personal and
professional networks.” I

 Shew said. “If you expect career services to
hot only help you but do the work for you,
then you’ll be disappointed. You only get
out of it as much as you put into it.”

CDPA’s most visible work on campus

manifests in their seasonal career fairs. On 7

Sept. 25, the office will put on its large fall
/rsareer Fair with more than 200 employ-
ers planning to attend the event. CDPA
will host a Graduate and Law School Fair
on Sept. 27 with representatives from 45
schools expected to attend. The ofﬁce also
plans another Career Fair in the spring.

events on campus,” Asher said. i

For students who prefer one-on-one as-
sistance from the office, the ﬁrst step is to
meet with a career counselor. Each career

counselor in the office specializes in work- »

ing with students from speciﬁc majors. The
career counselors often possess connec-
tions. with employers related to the ﬁeld

of study a student is undertaking, or the .

career a student is interested in pursuing.
Students can visit the CDPA office in per-

son or call to ‘make an appointment. Walk-

in appointments are also available Monday
through Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. T
Asher described the walk-in hours as
one of the career center’s most frequently
used services. ‘ 2

though. The CDPA also helps students ﬁnd
jobs to complement their class schedule
or for the summer months. Career con-

. sultants work with students on perfecting

their cover letters and resumés, and ﬁnd-
ing which job matches their_interests.

For students who don’t want to venture
outside their dorm room while working
on their job search, the CDPA offers ‘Fu-
tureLinks, an online job search website
with job listings exclusive to Pitt students.
Employment—seekers can scroll through
hundreds of jobs and upload their resume
to the website to send out to employers.
FutureLinks can be found on the sidebar of
students’ my.pitt homepages.

.Students more interested in gaining
experience than paychecks can also meet

with a career consultant to learn about in-
ternship opportunities around Pittsburgh.
This year, the office introduced a new pro-
gram guaranteeing students who complete
-it an internship. After completing a six-ses-
sion Internship Preparation Program that
involves learning the art of resumé writ-
ing and interviewing, among other skills,
students are guaranteed an internship by
CDPA. '
The ofﬁce also provides students with
networking opportunities. Two programs

services. The Panther Shadow Program

who volunteer to share knowledge of their

CDPA hosts’spot networking programs
throughout the year, as well, including din-
ners and other activities where students
can mingle with alumni.

This year, in addition to the Intern-

Internships abroad offer diverse" experiences to students

@_ Naomi Borrebach
' Opz'nz'ons Editor
I said farewell to Pittsburgh _this past June
to spend a portion of my summer in Israel.
Although lying on the beach and swim-
ming with dolphins was awesome, my
*9fnain purpose for being there was to intern
at a publishing company injerusalem.
While I had considered doing an in-
ternship in the U.S., I was interested in
the different type of experience that an
internship abroad could give me, because I

" wanted to learn more about Israeli culture.

Interning abroad can give you a chance to

learn speciﬁc skills: some other students

interning in Jerusalem were pre—veteri-
nary__ students and spent some weekends
volunteering at the zoo in Jerusalem, so
they had more experience learning about
animals that were speciﬁc to the Middle-
Eastern climate.

One of the greatest beneﬁts of hav-
ing an internship in Israel was that I was
given amuch higher degree of responsibil-
ity than I would have been given in most
comparable American internships. Most

internships for writing or humanities stu-
dents in the U.S. involve at least some de-
gree of grunt work, such as making photo
copies or answering phones. At my Israeli
publishing company, I didnot do any cleri-
cal work; I was speciﬁcally given work that
would enhance my editorial skills.

Having an internship abroad is also
helpful in gaining international connec-
tions..In the event of future travel, work or

studying abroad, it’s helpful to know peo- 4

ple and organizations in other countries. It
also looks great on your resume — Ameri-
can employers want to know that you can

interact well with people from other coun-
tries, adapt to new situations and learn
different skills.

Similar to studying abroad, it’s also in-

’ teresting to travel somewhere and not live

as a tourist. The company I interned at was
located in" a very non-touristy neighbor-
hood of Jerusalem that I had to take two
buses to get to.’It was a great cultural ex-
perience to see more of Jerusalem than I
would on a tour and to be in a place where
average Israelis worked and lived, but I
also had to contend with not always being
able to ﬁnd someone who spoke enough
English to help me with directions.

There are deﬁnitely some downsides
to doing an internship in a foreign ‘coun-
try. All of the rules of adapting to a new
country and culture apply, and you’ll have
the added "stress of working and trying to
make a good impression on your boss and
coworkers. ‘

. Figuring out ﬁnances can be one of the
biggest drawbacks of doing an internship

abroad. As in America, it’s unlikely that in- '

terns get paid — their work is considered

an educational experience. Not earning I

any money from your internship can make
a bigger ﬁnancial impact when you factor
in the costs of going abroad. And it’s also
unlikely that an American will be able to
ﬁnd a part—time job while abroad —— while
I know of Americans who work in Israel
as bartenders and waiters, doing so usu-
allyrequires living in the" country for an
extended period of time and_having ad-
vanced foreign-language skills. '

Most people who do internships

abroad do them through speciﬁc intern--

ship programs, because it is often difficult
for an American to break into the intern-
ship market in a foreign country. These
programs are often offered through study
abroad programs or through universities.
For example, Pitt offers a summer intern-
ship for credit in London. The beneﬁt of
these programs is that they typically plan
details such as housing, ﬂights and some

meals, details that can be difﬁcult to ar-

    Take advantage of quirks

when interviewing

Elizabeth Weisel
Columnist

Applying for jobs is easy. Proving you deserve
the job is challenging. Once your resumé and
references leave your hands, you have no
control over whether or not you get called
back for an interview. While there are things
you can do to increase your chances, such as
a follow—up email or phone call, you have no
real control.

' However, Once you are called for an in-
terview, control comeseback. It is up to you
to make yourself stand out from every other
applicant. There are many important aspects
of interviewing that can help you get the job,
but I’d argue that being memorable, no mat-
ter what it’s for, is the most important thing
to consider when preparing for an interview.

Though you may know every fact about
the company, or have the most intern experi-

ence or have the highest GPA and most extra- '

curriculars, chances are good that there are
other applicants with sin1ilar qualiﬁcations
as yours._ Especially when you’re in college, or

‘ recently graduated, you have not had many

opportunities to build your resumé to set
yourself apart, simply because you haven’t
had the time to take advantage of them. '
At the end of the day, the person inter-
viewingyou has probably seen at least a
handﬁil of applicants before or after you, and
so many details about so many people can

. be confusing and overwhelming for an in-

terviewer. If you make yourself memorable,
they will look past the facts listed on your
resumé and think instead about the speciﬁc
qualities you could bring to their workplace.
There are a handful ofways you can make
yourself memorable. Here are a few tips I

' have used in the past that have been proven

to make mememorable to my employer.
Wear a pop Ofcolor

Whether it’s a bright tie with your dark
suit for men or a snazzy pair of red shoes for

women, it’s relatively simple to dress up your
interview outﬁt with a pop of color. I wore
yellow shoes to an interview once, and while
my mom argued that it was unprofessional,
I ended up being hired and ﬁnding out that
my supervisor remembered my bright shoes.
A color standing out against your otherwise
toned—down outﬁt will help your interviewer
remember What you look like and, therefore,
he will be able to put a face to your resumé.
Colors such as red and yellow are particularly
vibrant, which you can complement with
your personality.

‘Enhance something already memorable

about you

I am very short —— a few inches below
ﬁve feet. When I go to interviews, instead of
wearing the highest shoes I can ﬁnd so I ap-
pear average, I always wear ﬂats. I know that
my unusual height is noticeable for everyone
I meet, and it’s not any different for an inter-
viewer. I’m already small, so I might as well
stay small and hope the interviewer will re-
member me because of it. Sounds crazy, but
according to my past employers, it works. So
ﬁnd something about yourself that makes
you immediately memorable — maybe your
hairstyle or your funky glasses or whatever it
is that physically sets you apart from others
— and play it up.

Be straight-up
Unrelated to appearance, if I learned

anything from bad interviews, it’s that in-
terviewers know when you’re lying. Maybe

Q not lying, but feeding them total bull. We’re

always instructed to sell ourselves in an in-
terview, to spin our resumés into something
tailor—made for the company that we’re in-
terviewing with. ‘But this often makes you
sound like you’re not being genuine, which is
a foundational point of attraction in any per-

« Taking a ob in a n ty: What cs should you have?

Nick Stamatakis and Rosie McKinley
Colummsts

You have been presented with a job in a
new city. You won’t know anybody there,
and the city isn’t particularly known for
being a center for 20-somethings. How
should you go about making your decision
to move there?

Rosie McKinley: Well, you wouldn’t
have to pay me much.

‘ Moving to a new city is ideal. Cities
are great because of their distinct muse-
ums, parks and quirks. And as much as I
love Pittsburgh, I’ve been here and done
that. I’ve learned about Andy Warhol and
seen the dinosaurs in Carnegie Museum
hundreds of times. I’m tired of running
the same trails in Schenley, and I’ve eaten
enough Primanti Bros. Doesn’t mean I
don’t like fries on my sandwich, but it’s
time for a new city.

I am also tired of being in a center for
20-somethings. It’s hard to meet an estab-

lished, moneymaking partner when your
social setting is.Hemingway’s or Peter’s.
And as a soon—to—be graduate, I’m more in-
terested in ﬁnding an employed silver fox
or cougar than a starving philosophy major
scraping by on half—off and PBR.

Speaking of Hemingway’s, during Blue
Moon Wednesday, I ran into Luke — last
seen in the basement of Pi Lam freshman
year. Moving to a new city and not knowing
anyone means youﬁnally get away from all
those mistakes you made in the drunken
weekend blurs of semesters past. Cheers to
anonymity! '

Mostly, I want a job in a new city be-
cause I’m tired of being a blonde commu-
nications major from outside Philly and
ready to be that exotic gal from the East
Coast who was cool enough to move here.

Nick Stamatakis: Good points, but
you’re discounting how difﬁcult it can be to

develop large social networks in new cities.

If you are in an organized intern-
ship program, a college campus or a high
school, you are constantly interacting with
many new people almost accidentally. If it
took you four years to build a support net-
work in this city, it will take you way more
than four years to build a support network
of the same size in a new city.

Doesn’t this personal cost demand
some kind of income premium? Thrust
into a new city, you’ll be faced with a situ-
ation where family and automatic relation-
ships are no longer guaranteed. Regardless
of how socially savvy you ‘may be, or how
good looking you feel, you may end up
more lonely. ’

If you are in a city strongly tilted toward
younger people, this won’t be rough for,
long. But try to think for a second about
the simple logistics of meeting people in a
city with many older workers. Are you sup-

tined for bingo nights, reading groups and
slow, small bars for social interactions‘?

RM: As with any risk, when the risk of
encountering social pressures is height-
ened, so is the reward.

When we move as a group, with orga-
nized internship programs or highly or-
ganized study abroad programs, we are
provided with a structure that allows us
to make friends easily with people in the
same program. Yet such structure inher-
ently restricts us; we won’t be forced to ex-
pand. We won’t explore as independents.
We become the people who study abroad
in Spain but don’t learn much Spanish be-
cause we’re too busy with Americans in our
program. Sticking to our own age group

“ or culture defeats the purpose of moving

Loneliness be damned, I am moving
to a new city where I can experience new
things. Even if a city isn’t famous for being
a hot spot of the young, that doesn’t mean

., it can’t be fun. Take Roanoke, Va., — which
ranks with Pittsburgh as one of the AARP’s
top “Cities to Retire to.” Roanoke is well
known for its hiking trails, independent
movie theater, low cost of living and sym-

ﬁm.

NS: I’m not saying people should stay
in Oakland when they graduate; there is
an obligation to leave your undergradu-
ate, home to avoid Ryan Lochte-style adult
adolescence. The last acceptable day to go
to P—Caf is graduation day.

But you’re romanticizing things. Cit-
ies without a large, active 20-something

V scene don’t_suddenly become deposits of

authenticity. Roanoke isn’t ﬁill of friendly
40-year-old ship builders and cowboys
waiting to tell you stories about the good
old days to slowly pull back a curtain to an
exotic, new lifestyle.

It’s easier to integrate into new lifestyles
if you have people you know or can at least
familiarize yourself with. Get dumped into
Billings, Mont., and we would “explore as

independents” far more with like-minded
people. The stylized ideal of an adventur-
ous youth slashing through a jungle to
encounter and befriend ancient wisdom
is wrong; more accurate is the vision of
two young adults snickering at the guy in
the corner explaining noodling (a popular
Oklahoma pastime where you stick your
hand into river mud hoping to catch a cat-
ﬁsh), and then maybe going to do it.

RM: Maybe you’re right. Maybe our
generation is far too separated from the
dreams of independence that conceived
this nation. Perhaps the crippling fear of
being alone means we do always need con-
stant companionship. Maybe that’s why we
ﬁnd ourselves continuously connected to
each other via social media.

But I’Ve never been that girl who needs

a friend to go to the bathroom with. I don’t
want a life partner until I’m at least 35. I’ve
never wanted my identity tied to someone
else’s.

Moving to a new city alone grants the
opportunity of complete independence.
It’s a place where no one will base his
opinion of me on who my roommates are
or who I’m in a picture with on Heming-
way’s wall. Stripped from friend groups
and comfortable relationships, a new city
is where we have identities that are solely
and completely ours. It’s been a fun four
years of giggling at the guy talking noo-
dling, but I’m ready to be deﬁned without
them. —

NS: You Win for comparing America’s
youth with the dreams of the Founding Fa-
thers. Oh, to have your rhetorical ﬂair.

ABROAD

Epitropoulos and Whitehead stress the
importance of having experience in a dif-
ferent country.

According to Epitropoulos, studying
abroad is a learning experience. '

“Most importantly, it teaches people to
be global citizens,” he said. ‘

4 This idea of being a “global citizen” is
‘why Pitt encourages studying abroad. The
‘University Center for International Stud-

Ofﬁce. It assists in developing more inter-
nationally aware students. -

the world; it’s very important in today’s
global economy,” Whitehead said. '

Besides knowledge, being a “global citi-
zen” requires the ability to live and work
abroad.

“As states become weaker, the ability
to adapt and move is more important than
ever,” Epitropoulos said. , _

Pitt makes this possible, offering stu-
dents the ability to study abroad in more
than 100 countries, either through Pan-
ther Programs or independently found
programs from which Pitt will accept cred-
its. The Panther Programs —— which Pitt
faculty have developed to work as an even
exchange with university curriculum --
have classes that affect students’ »GPAs.

The Panther Programs‘ align directly

UPMC

with courses at Pitt, but Pitt—recognized
study abroad programs have indepen-
dently structured courses that outside
organizations design and develop. Stu-
dents’ grades from these programs do not
directly affect their GPA —- unlike Panther
Programs —— but they do transfer if Pitt ad-
visers approve the courses in advance.
Bridget Kane, a junior anthropology
and environmental studies major, was

Jeffr Whitehead

part of the ﬁrst ever Pitt in Ghana this past .

spring. For her, Ghana offered a chance to
adapt to a very different culture. For those
studying in places that offer less culture
shock, the experience can be equally as
helpful. -

“The reason it’s helpful is that you have
to adapt to situations you’re not used to

i and learn to live with and be part of a dif-

ferent culture,” Kane said.

Sarah Simkin, who graduated from Pitt
last spring and is currently attending Bos-
ton University for graduate school, studied

abroad through Pitt in London. There, she ‘

was able to do an internship in public rela-
tions for the company Murad UK.

“Study abroad was amazing for a lot of '

reasons but career—wise deﬁnitely gives me
an edge having that in my resume,” Simkin
said. “It’s always a conversation point in
interviews.” , ‘ «

Kane would agree about this effect of
study abroad.

“I was in a group interview earlier to-
day, actually, where the hiring manager
went out of his way to bring up the fact that
I had studied abroad. It’s both a topic of in-

terest and a really useful tool in a number p

of situations.” E
