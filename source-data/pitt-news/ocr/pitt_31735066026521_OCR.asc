]1\/IPULSE WINS NATIONAL
AWARD

Impulse magazine, The Pitt
News’ weekly entertainment/few
tures publication, has received
national recognition as a college
newspaper “trendsetter.”

The College Newspaper
Business & Advertising Managers
organization (CNBAM) gave
Impulse the award for taking
advantage of the unﬁlled Pittsburgh
college weekend-magazine niche
and sending the publication to other
local college campuses. CNBAM
gave Impulse the 1997 Trendsetter
Award on March 28 at a national
conference in Atlanta.

“It certainly makes me feel
much less like I don’t know what
I’m doing,” said Steve Segal,
Impulse’s initial editor, about the
award.

_ Pitt News editor in chief
Anthony Breznican noticed the

need for a separate publication to-

print the scores of lifestyle features
ﬁlling the paper’s news section last
year. He realized other schools‘
would also like to read about
Pittsburgh’s hot weekend spots and
college—directed entertainment.

Breznican described his vision
to Segal, and the two collaborated
to create an Impulse prototype
which Breznican then pitched to
Pitt’s Publications Board.

When Breznican, the newspa-
per’s advisers and business manag-
er Janise Smith crunched the num-
bers, they projected that, with the
minimal revenue guaranteed by
advertising contracts, Impulse
would make $12 in its first year.

The numbers and the prototype
hooked the Pub Board.

Heather Longley, who took
over as editor of Impulse in
January, won The Pitt News’ Editor
of the Year Award for her success in
making sure it appealed to both
mainstream and alternative audi-
ences.

“I hope that as it’s passed down
from editor to editor,” said
Breznican, “it [Impulse] continues

to grow and to give in-depth cover-

age of student life.”

PHILADELPHIA, Pa.— Police have
charged an 11-year-old boy with murder.

Philadelphia Police say the boy accom-
panied another youth during the robbery and
fatal shooting of a Philadelphia man on
Tuesday night.

Police believe the 11-year-old watched
as his 17-year-old accomplice shot and
killed 27-year-old Andrew Rogers. The
older youth has not yet been charged.

Homicide inspector Jerrold says the
younger boy was not the shooter. But Kane
says, “He conspired with the 17-year-old to
rob this man. As a result of the conspiracy
and the robbery, the man was shot in the
head and di ”

It is unclear whether the pair took any-
thing from Rogers.

The D. A.’s Olﬁce has not decided
whether to charge the boy as an adult.

Kane says the younger boy was initial-
ly interviewed as a witness to the robbery ,
but that subsequent investigation turned up
inconsistencies in his story. He was brought
back in accompanied by his mother
Thursday.

The boy was charged early Friday.

Scor GAMES

oppressive rain and brisk afternoon,
fewer people than expected actually
showed up. Ford said he thinks the
organizers raised a little over $200.
“Even if it was just me and three
others out here today.” Ford said,
“that’s $32 and that buys a lot of pens.”
This is just the first fund-raising
event organized by Ford’s program,
“Solidarity Not Charity,” which he
started as a member of the Pittsburgh
Cuba Coalition to provide support for
Cuban children. -
The Cuba Coalition is an organiza-
tion dedicated to ending the U.S. trade

‘embargo and “establishing a peaceful

and respectful coexistence” with Cuba.

Ford said he thought he could get a
lot of Pitt students involved in the coali-
tion by holding the ﬁrst annual» Scottish
games, and have fun.

Ford will personally deliver the
supplies to Cuba in July.

“Solidarity Not Charity” was a line
taken from a speech by Cuban dictator
Fidel Castro, according to Ford. He also
said it’s in protest of the trade embargo.

“I’m not bringing supplies down
because I feel bad for you [Cubans],”
he said. “I’m doing it because I’m sup-
porting you [the Cuban people].’’

This can be dangerous because the
U.S. government levies stiff penalties
for- violating the trade embargo on
Cuba. This embargo bars any citizen or
company in the United States from tak-
ing goods to or from Cuba. If prosecut-
ed, Ford could receive 10 years in
prison and a $250,000 fine.

But Ford says he is not afraid.

He’s in good company because in

January, Pittsburgh ofﬁcially became a‘

sister city with Matanzas, Cuba.
Pittsburgh City Council, spearheaded
by Councilman Jim Ferlo, released a
proclamation of sisterhood in which
‘council members vowed to visit Cuban
religious, educational, medical, cultur-
al, governmental and community insti-
tutions to exchange ideas and good
will.

The International

Sister City

Initiative was founded by Dwight D.
Eisenhower to promote world peace
through face—to-face diplomacy regard-
less of official governmental policy.

THE PITT NEWS

FROM PAGE 1

Pittsburgh’s proclamation rejected
the embargo referring to it as a “relic of
the cold war.” It went on to say that the
council “urges federal elected officials
and President Clinton to move toward
normalization of relations with the peo-
ple of Cuba based on the principles of
peace, respect for international law,
friendship, sovereignty and internation-
al good will.”

Shortly thereafter, 17 Pittsburghers,
including Ferlo, traveled to Cuba to
complete the accord with Matanzas.

Ferlo said the trip was his second
and that he is planning another sister-
city trip later this year.

After the first Visit, he said, he
received a letter from the Treasury
Department asking him what he did
there and if he spent any money.

In January, just before he went for
the second time, Ferlo held a luncheon
attended by the two representatives
from the Cuban government. Later, he
said, a “higher up” person from the
State Department contacted him wanti-
ng to know why the two Cubans attend-
ed to the luncheon and what they were
doing in Pittsburgh.

“Needless to say,” Ferlo said, “I

‘ proceeded to give her a stern lecture. I

resented it.”

Ferlo said he encourages Ford’s trip
to Cuba and that by getting more and
more people to travel to Cuba,
Americans can affect the U.S. policy
toward it. He said this is going to hap-
pen “from the grass roots up.”

“I think the more people that break

the ban and do it, breaking the back-
ward policy of ‘the U.S. government,
the closer we come to having it over-
turned,” Ferlo said.

Still, Ford said he can’t be sure he
won’t be prosecuted for violating the
embargo, but said he feels that with
members of city council supporting
trade with Cuba and a good lawyer, he
should be OK. ,

“It’s not just ex-hippies and college
students involved in this,” Ford said.
“There’s many different people, they
just don’t prosecute white doctors and
lawyers yet they go after Cubans. But if
someone has access to legal help they’ll
be OK.” i

When he was 13 years old, Gordon
MacLeod, Pitt University Senate President
and professor, had an unusual illness -—-
relapsing peniculitis, a sickness that resem-
bled rheumatic fever. For years, he was in
and out of Boston’s Massachusetts General
Hospital, staying there several months at a
time.

The doctors were through his room so
much, MacLeod became fond of most of
them and spent lots of time talking to them
He grew especially close to Paul Dudley
White, his favorite doctor, who had been
President Eisenhower’s cardiologist.

‘They were wonderful,” said MacLeod.
“Just charming.”

MacLeod’s illness was so rare that doc-
tors lectured about him at the Harvard
School of Medicine. They brought the
young MacLeod into a room ﬁlled with stu-
dents and doctors to discuss his malady.

The special attention MacLeod rexeived
from the doctors inspired him to become a
doctor himself, and years later, while teach-
ing at the Harvard School of Medicine, he

' reviewed extraordinary cases in front of doc-

tors in the same room where his childhood
illness had been discussed. '

MacLeod is a professor of healtl1-ser-
vices administration in the Graduate School
of Public Health and a clinical professor of
medicine at Pitt. His students recently select-
ed him to receive the Pitt 1997-98
Excellence in Teaching Award. ,

The recipient of this armual award is
chosen for his commitment to teaching, “one
of the most important functions of the
school,” wrote Howell Hasser, president of
the Doctoral Student Organization, in the
notiﬁcation letter sent to MacLeod.

The award will be presented during
commencement at 4 p.m on Sunday.

As noted, Macl..eod began his journey
toward this award while a professor at the
Harvard’s medical school. While there,
MacLeod started down the health care road
by serving on the board that created the
Harvard Community Health Plan, a program

~ that provided a health care system to the sur-

THE PITTANEWS

Dr. Mocleocl: The man who
the road for American heolt

rounding area.

MacLeod said this proposal “was just a
gleam in their [board members’] eye at that
time.” The board established the plan after
MacLeod left to teach at Yale.

This program inspired the federal gov-
emment’s health maintenance organization
P1'081‘-am 9

At Yale, MacLeod was one of the two
people who set up the Yale Community
Health Plan, also based on the Harvard plan.

Because of MacLeod’s outstanding
organization of these programs, the federal
government invited him to create a new
national health-care plan.

A patchwork health plan existed at that
time, but it did not combine the services of

, private—practice doctors, hospitals and insur-

ance companies.

The federal government adopted
MacLeod’s proposal, and HMOS have
grown steadily in popularity ever since.

Today, 95 percent of practicing physi-
cians have at least a small contract with an
HMO. .

“It would be almost impossible for a
physician to practice today without a con-
tract with an HMO,” noted MacLeod. V

However, HMOs faced a stormy period
in the late 1980s that made them a little less
popular among physicians and patients. »

In 1988, Congress decided that in ﬁve
years it would amend a law —— set up at the
time HMOs were created —— that said insur-
ance companies must be federally qualiﬁed
to operate in the health care ﬁeld. ”

In 1993, the law was passed, and any-
one could get into the health-care business
without being federally qualiﬁed.

‘That was one of the things the govem—
ment made a mistake. on, in my opinion,”
said MacLeod

The “mistake” launched what is known
as the “managed care era,” which allowed
any managed—care unit to call itselfan HMO.
This was detrimental to health care because
the care systems became more concerned
with making moneythan managing health
care.

 

paved

CCI re

“What does someone
who runs Aetna know about
health care?” asked
MacLeod.

The problems started at
this point, said MacLeod,
and are still increasing.

These problems pres-
sured doctors to discharge
patients from hospitals earli-
er, and to not give patients
the advice to go to a special-
ist who would charge the
insurance company big
bucks, said MacLeod.

And, T from there,
MacLeod noticed the
emphasis moved toward
signing up both more
patients and more hospitals
instead of giving the patients
the care they need.

The three-legged stool
of health care — service,
teaching and research —— is
balancing almost completely
on the service leg, said
MacLeod.

“The problems that arise
will cause so many trials and
tribulations that it [rnanaged-care system]
will someday go down,” said MacLeod.

Despite these problems, MacLeod still
“strongly advocates” the HMO system and
has used his inﬂuence at Pitt to steer the
three—legged stool back to teaching and
research. He is strongly concerned by the
future of academic medical centers like
UPMC, which he said have been caught up
in the commercialism of managed care.

“Academic medical centers are not

business centers,” said MacLeod. ‘They
have a different mission.”

But managed care is harming this rnis-
sion, for three major reasons, according to
MacLeod.

First, hospital proﬁts have been adverse-
ly alfected by the rise in managed care, he
said. Ten years ago, hospitals earned 44 cents

~ out of every dollar spent
on health care. That prof-
it is now down to 39 cents
and will soon be reduced
to 32 cents, said

MacLeod.
Also, the federal

currently
Americans to
afford health care, but
many will have to go
without this care when

Monday, 20 April 1998

 

Dr. Gordon MacLeod helped develop the feclrol
government's HMO program in the W705.

the economy weakens, according to
MacLeod. ‘

For these reasons, MacLeod considers
the future of health care in America to be
“very stormy.”

“It is going to be a most trying time,” he
said.

MacLeod is the author of more than 100
publications on HlVIOs, health care centers,
academic health centers, bioethics, intema—
tional health care,‘ and reforms in health care
ﬁnancing. ‘ .

MacLeod still meets with government
ofﬁcials and has been invited to the Clinton
White House three times to give advice and
new statistics on health-care reform One of
these times, he had lunch with Hillary
Clinton.

MacLeod also is a frequent speaker for
the government’s National Health Policy
Council, which heads the U.S. health-care
reform effort, to speak about HlVlOs and
health care reform.

As a member of the Minute Men of
Pitt’s School of Medicine —' an elite group
of faculty members formed as a link
between the administration and students of
the School of Medicine -—- MacLeod is in a
position to help keep health care’s likely
stormy future from affecting the UPMC. He
addressed the group in January, outlining the
problems and encouraging other faculty
members to bring the emphasis back to
teaching and away from proﬁt making.

“If, as health and medical care profes-
sionals, we take the lead in opposing corpo-
rate proﬁts in academic medical centers, oth-
ers will follow suit,” MacLeod said in his
speech.

A resurgence of
activism and  

optimism on campus?

Who says Pitt students are apathetic?

Who says our generation just sits idly in
coffee shops and doesn't stand up for what
it believes? »

This weekend, a group of students orga-
nized a fundraiser —— a bunch of "Scottish
Games" played on the Cathedral lawn.
Though it may sound like less than a big
deal, the games were, in fact, a wonderfully
successful expression of civil disobedience.

The funds they raised, in addition to
money that will be raised in future events,
will be used to buy school supplies for
Cuban children.

And that, in point of fact, is illegal. »

Current U.S. embargo laws prohibit
U.S. citizens from providing any form of
support for the Cuban people, even in the
form of crayons and Elmer's Glue.

The students who organized this project,
however, are confident that they will be
able to get around the law and successfully
aid our underprivileged neighbors living
just 90 miles from this country.

A little civil disobedience can go a long
way. Martin Luther King Jr. could have told
you that. Gandhi could have told you that.

The fact is, our leaders don't always do
what is right (surprise), and their laws
sometimes make it hard for the people to do
what is right.

U.S. embargos against Cuba are
designed to put pressure on the Cuban gov-
ernment. Unfortunately, it is always the
people who suffer most from such sanc-
tions.

And though it might seem reasonable to
expect that laws would be aimed at encour-
aging people to go out of their way to help
their neighbors, it is an unfortunate fact that
most people are discouraged from generos-
ity and selﬂessness, knowing that you have
to be willing to suffer the consequences to
help people.

But it's reassuring to know that there are
still people out there who are willing to risk
legal prosecution, or even put their lives on
the line to do something for the greater
good of the world.

A place you can find yourself

Pitt’s biggest weakness is also its
biggest strength.

This place is so huge, so irnperson—
al, that it takes years to ﬁnd your niche.
Persistence is the only thing all success-
ful Pitt students have in common.

A lot of people graduate. That’s
nice, but it's no big deal. _

_ Finding a passion before you go is
the challenge Why wade through four
years of uncertainty?

But it’s so damn tough to become a
part of something at Pitt that most people
can’t ﬁnd something to enjoy.

If you’re lucky enough to stumble
upon it, you have to force yourself in as
the low man on the totem pole, and hope
hardworkreallydoespayoﬁintlieend.

I’ve spoken to countless administra-
torswhowanttoﬁndawaytomakethis
University more welcoming. I guess it’s
good that they keep trying, but I don’t
know if they’ll succeed

Maybe they shouldn’t succeed.

Pitt makes you tough. Pitt forces
you to become good at dealing with dif-
ﬁcult people. Pitt offers you hundreds of
wonderful options and demands a deci-
sion

Most people would falter under that
kind of pressure. Pitt manages to save
most of them anyway.

You look around, and everyone is
just a stranger with a familiar face. There
are countless student activities, but most
people come to a university like Pitt
because they don’t know what they
want. It’s hard to join when you have no
interests, and it's nearly impossible for a
mammoth institution like Pitt to guaran-
tee the happiness of its thousands of stu-
dents.

People come to the University for
direction, but if they ﬁnd it, they do so
alone.

Like a lot of people, I came to Pitt
because I had nowhere else to go. It was

the only school that accepted me, and I

spectator sport, from the reporters who
watch life happen, to the people who
read about it the next day. You’re
involved, but distant —— important and
objective at the same time.

You can’t really love a place — a
thing like Pitt, which is just buildings and
grass and strangers. You can’t love it the
way you love a person, but you can care
for it.

I came here hating this university.
But seeing it through a reporter’s eyes
and placing what I saw on the page
changed me. I realized the greatest aﬁec-
tion you can express for a heartless, cold
institution like a university is the desire
to improve it.

I found my passion. It is words, and
stories and people. .

Part of me will always belong here,
if only on the shelf in the William Pitt

kle accordingly, with age.

You have to seize the life you enjoy.
And if it seems dilﬁcult —— it is. Pitt
makes it that way. But it makes you
stronger.

I’ve seen so many friends graduate
and leave this place forever. The “real
worl ” called, and they managed to ﬁnd
a place for themselves in it. All the best
knew there was more to Pitt than just the
school.

They were lucky. I am, too.

Saturate your life with what you
love.

That’s all I really wanted to say.

A Zﬁhitore Notebook  

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences
recently released its latest in a series
of long-terrn planning reports, the
Phase V document. -

Like its predecessor,
the Phase IV report, this document
outlines the general direction that
FAS will follow in the coming years.
It also outlines some curious ideas
about how FAS should develop.

We've heard -for a long time now
that FAS will cut its tenured and
tenure-strearn faculty size to 505 peo-
ple — cuts which should be more
than achieved by the current faculty-

‘retirement incentive package. What
hasn't been very clear is how FAS
will deal with having fewer faculty to
take up the teaching load

Speculation was that the load
would be picked up in part by gradu-
ate teaching assistants and in part by
nontenure—stream teachers.

1 According to the Phase V docu-
ment, moreoftheloadwillbetaken
up by nontenure streamers than we

émight have guessed The number of
teaching assistantships is also going
to reduced, by about 10 percent.

_ Ifthe numbers from the Phase IV
document are still reliable, Pitt is not
planning to increase the number of
nontenure streamers proportionately.

Intheend,thiswil1rneanlower

how well an institution can educate its stu-

Higher faculty-to-student ratios mean
professors can spend more time with indi-
vidual students and help them to learn.

First-"class universities brag about these"  ' 

ratios in their recruiting brochures.

games to recruit prospective students.

‘ 10 rue PITT NEWS _ Monday, 20 ‘April 1998'

Bythetime youreadtl1is,mytermas
opinions editor will be over. I've learned a
lot while I was here, including wisdom I
will take with me for the rest of my life:
When media claims to be perfectly objec-
tive, don't believe them.

Editing this section and writing edito-
rialshasrequiredmetostayontopofthe
news by reading a lot of newspapers and
even watching (gasp!) TV news.

One news station I’ve become partic-
ularly armoyed by is FOX News and its
slogan: "We report. You decide."

Liars. The fact is, editing means
deciding. When we decide what stories to
run, what to include, what to cut, what to
print, and what is important enough to be
reported, we have decided what readers
will think about. A responsible editor is
one who does this while thinldng more
about what the reader ought to know than
just what makes a spectacular headline.

Unfortunately, when newspapers try
to keep pace with television and an
Internet which have no respect for verify-
ing stories, but only for ‘being the ﬁrst to
tell a story, you can guess what happens to
careful editing.

Read asmuch as you can, and take
everything at face value, nothing more,

regardless of the source.

Kris Kissel’s gotta go. Yeah, he's running
outta change. There are a lot of things, if
he could, he'd rearrange.

Michael Berquist
 Columnist

George Bernard Shaw once wrote that

the "lack of money is the root of all evil."
Perhaps never were truer words spoken.
Americans typically don't like to discuss
things like money, but today in the United
States a disturbing trend is emerging. The
richest Americans are getting richer, the
poorest Americans are getting po‘orer,_ and
the middle class is getting squeezed. Indeed,
the lack of income forworking Americans is
becoming an evil that people are more and
more willing to speak of.

There have been, in recent years, a
plethora of magazine and newspaper articles
decrying the divisions between the haves
and the have—nots, the wealthy Americans
with their stock portfolios and the hard-
working, blue—collar Americans who ﬁnd
themselves each year working harder and
harder for- less and less. One former steel-
worker complained: "Things changed. Now
you work harder for less. The working man
is getting killed out there." There is evidence
to support his observation. Since 1973, for
example, the poorest 40 percent of
Americans saw their real income decline.
Income growth among the middle class has

been practically nonexistent.

Another area of American life where
there is a widening gap between the haves
and have-nots is in the area of technology.
Often the overenthusiastic rhetoric of
technophiles, ‘whosedreams of the possibili-
ties that technology seems to offer often out-
strip its realities and limitations, makes
things like the Intemet and e-mail out to be
dramatic answers to all of the problems that
plague mankind: disease, war, poverty. The
fact is that these things will never eliminate
undesirable aspects of our society like pover-
ty and moral decay. In fact, today computers
and the Internet may be exacerbating divi-
sions within American society.

A Trme magazine article I read recently
noted: "The fact is that access to the new
technology generally breaks down along tra-
ditional class lines. Wealthy and upper-rnid—
dle—class families form the bulk of the 30

percent of American households that own

computers. Similarly, wealthier school dis-
tricts naturally tend to have equipment that is
unavailable to poorer 01168, and schools in
the more‘ aﬂluent suburbs have twice as
many computers per student as their less-
well-frmded urban counterparts." The article
went on to note an interesting trend: A work-
er who regularly uses a computer will tend to

earn 15 percent more than a worker who
does not have regular access to a computer.

The problems posed by the explosive
growth of the Internet and computer tech-
nology are thorny ones that cannot be easily
solved by the market. Telecommunications
companies, for example, typically install
newer infonrration systems in more aﬁluent
neighborhoods, forcing areas with many
urban areas with poorer people to wait for
these systems to be installed in their areas.
Seven million Americans, most in poorer
areas, have such antiquated telecommunica-
tions systems that their phones cannot even
provide basic access. Given how quickly
technology is advancing, these handicaps
often put the urban poor at a severe disad-
vantage in today's" highly competitive mar-
ketplace when they search for jobs. The
result is the establishment of what
Congressman Ed Markey has referred to as
an "information apartheid."

The govemrrrent, divided between war-
ring special-interest groups, has proven unre-
sponsive to the plight of working Americans.
Special-interest groups like the AFL-CIO
hold all of the cards. The AFL-CIO uses its
clout to kill job—creating trade agreements,
and the national Chamber of Commerce
uses its power to write protections for big

To have or to have not, that is the question

business into the tax code. Special-interest
groups are gutting the government and leav-
ing rniddle-class families out in the wind

The trend that is rapidly emerging is a
particularly disturbing one. According to one
Harvard economist, "The new inequality
threatens us with a two«tiered society, an
apartheid economy in which the successful
upper and -upper-middle class live lives fun-
damentally different from the working class
and poor." The United States may become
two Americas, separate and unequal.

The divisions that these problems
threaten to exacerbate are dangerous ones.
Organized labor, for example, has done a
masterful job of exploiting fears that blue-
collar workers have about the globalization
of the economy, in an attempt to scuttle trade
agreements. It does this even though there is
scant evidence to support its claims that for-
eigners are taking the jobs of American
workers. Feel—good solutions like protection-
ism and isolationism will threaten to become
the norm in the future unless a serious
attempt is made to address the feelings that
working Americans have.

Michael Berquist wants everyone to know he
searched long and hard for that clever
George Bernard Shaw quote.

And now, I suppose,
we turn to the reason this
institution is even here: Pitt
Football.

Know that the only
completions you are likely to
see at a Pitt football game is
that of the keg at the pre-game
tailgate parties. Several mem-
bers of our team have narrow-
- ly missed several records this
year: unfortunately, they were
criminal records. While there
are no players on our team

still working towards the rep-

Cowboys. (Go , Panthers!!!)

It’s‘the friends you make here.

The people who stood behind you
(hopefully) as you projected your last
24 hours‘ worth of meals onto the
grass behind a parked campus police
cruiser and claimed that it was a case
of stomach flu that you were suffering
from —— when it was really a case of
generic beer. It’s the pals who told‘you
that your ex was a jerk and that they
couldn’t understand how anyone
thought the dream of bungee jumping
naked into the center of the Civic
Arena during a Pens game was “symp-
tomatic of a damn nut.” They’re even
the ones who stood by you through all
of your 57 different majors and lis-
tened to your 86,234 hours of dis-
course on different career plans.

That’s gotta be worth something,
huh?

This place is big and growing big-
ger rather quickly. (I predict that in 20
years the city_ of Pittsburgh will prob-
ably cease to exist when the mayor is
busted in a student allocations -— fund
scandal.) You’re really lucky if you
find a handful of these folks, let alone
one or two, despite the size of this
institution.

What _I’m trying to say here is that
you should treat Pitt just like your
crazy Grandpa Zeke up in the attic.

Know how to deal with the nasty,
dirty diapers it whips at you. Handle
each of its tantrums with patience.
And know that it doesn’t always make
the most rational or well-reasoned
decisions.

But like it anyway.

is what it is.

It’s been fun, folks, but my job

Plethora of As not so amazing

I want to correct some errors of fact in an article and the edito-
rial on grading in the English department in the April 16 edition of
The Pitt News.

David Brumble did not say that too many students were receiv-
ing A's in the English department. The memo dealt only with lower-
division courses. He said, in fact, that the percentages of A's in

lower—division composition and literature courses were at "about the V

mean for FAS departments." V

He asked me to look into the percentages in ﬁlm and writing
courses, which seemed high to him, and I did. Here is what I
learned: '

The courses listed in the memo as "ﬁlm studies" courses are the
production courses offered at Pittsburgh Filmmakers. These are
small courses taken by advanced students and make up a small per-
centage of the total courses in ﬁlm. Most "ﬁlm studies" courses are
listed on the grade rosters as courses in "English literature." And, as
Ed Ochester told your reporter, the majority of the lower—division
creative—writing courses are limited to majors. It is generally the case
in CA8 that grades run higher in courses limited to majors.

U.S. not free of blame or fault

In theApril 15 issue of The Pitt News, Michael Berquist seems
to have found the "crusade" he was blindly groping for earlier.

However, his statistics on political killings in Colombia are
one—sided and grossly misleading. AUN report last month conclud-
ed that of the approximately 3,300 murders committed in Colombia
in only the ﬁrst nine months of 1997, the vast majority were com-
mitted by the paramilitaries, which aresupported by the U.S.-fund-
ed army and police. ,

When he writes about crime and drugs, isn't it incumbent upon
Berquist to mention the role of the U.S. government in fostering the
same? When he whines about foreign countries refusing to extradite
criminals to the United States, shouldn't he at least recommend that
the United States extradite, say, the-drug dealer and terrorist Oliver
North to Nicaragua?

And shouldn't he see the contradiction in ending a colurrm on
international crime rings with a quotation from his hero John F.
Kennedy, who is alleged to have hired mobsters to assassinate a for-
eign head of state?

Brit wins battle of the brews

As a fellow Brit with vast experience drinking, I have to con-
cur with James Maude that British beer is far superior to its
American counterpart. -

For one thing, you get to appreciate your beer in a pint glass; no
half measures, please. .

There is a fuller ﬂavor (more alcohol content), a creamy head
and if you're a student it only costs a pound a pint ($1.50).

I'll be going home soon, and one of the things that I'll be glad to
get back to is my local pub and a good pint of bitter.

Townsend talks
four years of Pitt
memories

There are points in your life that
you will never forget.

Graduating from college is one-of
them.

For most seniors, including me, it
is time to go to work for 40 years or so
until Social Security —- if there’s any
left —- kicks in or I retire a self-made
millionaire.

We all dream of being rich, meet-
ing our soulmates and raising chil-
dren.

, That’s where you want to go, but
does it seem at all possible right now?

There are so many questions to be
answered.

Where will I live?

What will I be doing?

Will I be happy?

Will my life end up as boring as
my parents’?

Will a Saturday night consist of
watching a made—for-television movie
and finishing up another John
Grisham novel?

It’s possible, because as the birth-
days add up, you become more
mature. Drinking until your sweat is
toxic is replaced by a glass of wine at
dinner (red or white depending on the
meal). And making dinner becomes
more than just throwing a Hot Pocket
in the microwave, gurgling down
some faucet water and munching on a
Hostess snack for dessert.

It all changes with time, just like it
has during my four-year stay at Pitt.

Ze1da’s is gone. (For freshmen, it
was an all-ages bar on Bouquet
Street.)

The football team won more than
four games in aseason.

And the University seems to care
a little more about its students (e.g.,
free tickets to the Liberty Bowl. Oh,
and Starbucks in the Cathedral).

All in all, the changes have been a -

step in the right direction. Pitt is a
much better school than it was four
years ago.

There’s more grass on campus.

There’s some semblance of school
spirit. .

And more students than everxar
interested in SGB -— well, just try to
forget it’s because allocation funds
were embezzled.

My memories of this place are
endless. They range from the raunchy

Hoops lands third recruit for 1998 season

Junior college point guard Jeremy Holmes joins Primus, Seabrooks

Zachariah Blott
Managing Edltor

Jeremy Holmes, a 6-foot point
guard originally from Cleveland,
signed a national letter of intent last
week to play basketball at Pitt next
year, according to Pitt Head Coach
Ralph Willard.

Willard made the announcement
Thursday evening.

Holmes is presently a sopho-
more at Neosho County Junior
College in Kansas, which went 27-5
this year, and will bring true point-
guard skills to one of the Big East’s
youngest teams.

“He does whatever the situation
calls for,” said Neosho Head Coach
Jeff Guiot of Holmes. “He doesn’t
look to score much. He’ll make
everybody on the floor better.”

This past season, Holmes aver-
aged 10.2 points and 7.5 assists per
game. Last year, he averaged 8.2
assists per game. His assist averages
were second and first, respectively,
in the Jayhawk Conference, “which
is pretty much [all junior colleges
in] Kansas,” said Guiot.

During his two years at Neosho,
Holmes set school records with 15
assists in a game, 262 in a season
and 502 in his career. In addition, he

The Pittsburgh foot-
ball careers of ex-Panther
safety John Jenkins and
quarterback Pete
Gonzalez aren’t over yet.

After this weekend’s
NFL draft concluded late
Sunday, the Pittsburgh
Steelers signed both Pitt
players to free—agent con-
tracts, making the current
roommates and former
teammates, well, current
teammates. Again.

“It’s the opportunity
we’ve been waiting for,”
Jenkins said of the sign-
ing. The Pitt senior left his
home after the draft con-
cluded, but found out
about the contract offer
from his agent via his cel-

lular phone.

Draft experts and
scouts did not project
Jenkins as a potential pick,
unlike his roommate, who
some thought could be
chosen in the later rounds.

Offensive lineman
Tony Orlandini, a project-
ed fourth-round pick
according to some ser-
vices, was not selected. At
press time, his NFL status
was still unknown.

Orlandini and
Gonzalez could not be
reached for comment.
When he was asked about
his roommate Gonzalez
not getting drafted,

Jenkins said, “I think any

of us at this time, we’re all
excited, regardless of
whether or not we got
drafted.”

Pitt demolished in Saturday doubleheader, weather ruins Sunday at Three Rivers

Kevin Ltlley 8: Matt Mento
The Pitt News

The Pitt baseball team
fell victim to a 23-run bar-
rage in a doubleheader
Saturday against the Notre
Dame Fighting Irish. The
Panthers dropped both games
-——- by 11-0 and 12-1, respec-
tively —— and hadonly one

more chance to earn a win at- j

Three Rivers Stadium before
the close of the weekend
series.

Unfortunately, rain shut‘

out the Panthers just as effec-
tively as the Irish hurlers.
The Pitt-Notre Dame game
set for 5 p.m. Sunday was
postponed early in the after-
noon and has yet to be
rescheduled.

The rainout gave Panther
hitters another day to think
about Alex Shilliday and
Brad Lidge — the two

Saturday starters that struck
out 30 Pitt hitters in 14
innings.

“The first pitcher had a
real good fastball and curve-
ball combination,” said Pitt

second baseman Harry
Ciavarella of Shilliday. The

   

junior from South Bend
allowed just one hit in his
seven innings of work -
good enough for a complete
game in the opener of a col-
lege doubleheader, which is
scheduled for only seven
innings.

Shilliday
only allowed
one walk in
the contest
and had a
no—hitter
until the
sixth inning,
when Aaron
V i c a r i
reached base
on a single
—— a bunt
single.

Vicari
would be
thrown out
at second
after Pitt catcher David
Hoopes hit into a fielder’s
choice, and the Panthers
would go quietly in the
inning.

“Their pitcher in game
one was real good.‘ I think he
was ranked 18th in the coun-

try,” Vicari said. “But he was
hittable. There was no reason
we should have only had one
hit. They were real good
offensively, but we had the
opportunities — we just
couldn’t capitalize on them.”

Notre Dame showed its
offensive power in the top of
the sixth, scoring five runs to
make the score 11-0. Pitt
starter Bob Balazentis gave
up seven of those runs — all
five in the fifth frame, plus
one in the sixth and an early
run in the third -— before
being removed for reliever
Chris Gallick.

Gallick didn’t fare much
better. He gave up a single, a
walk, and another walk —‘~
good enough to score Irish
left fielder Alec Porzel, who
had singled off Balazentis.

Geoff Moak
Staff Wrlter

Although the event took place
before Sunday’s rainstorm, it was a
very dreary Saturday at the 1998
Panther Relays, Pitt’s first home
track meet of the season. Only eight
teams and a handful of unattached
athletes competed atthe meet, and
the lack of competition showed.

The Panthers won their share of
events, often doing so quite easily.
Leading Pitt’s victory parade was
hurdler Jack Jeffreys. He made his
win in the 400-meter hurdles look
easy; his time of 54.06 seconds was
more than two seconds faster than
anyone else’s..

Still, it wasn’t a completely sat-
isfying win. I

“I just wanted to go out and try
to qualify for the IC4As [regional
championship meet]. I just missed
it,” Jeffreys said.

The qualifying time for the
IC4A meet is 53.9 seconds.

Jeffreys also won the 110—meter
hurdles in convincing fashion, by
over a second, with a time of 14.47
seconds.

“I had a similar time last week,
but I had people pushing me,”
Jeffreys said. “I ran a technically
better race today. I didn’t hit as
many hurdles as I usually do.”

Off the track, Pitt’s Ron

Losiewicz dominated the throwing

ning the last leg.

events. His throw of 13.5 meters
won the shot put by over a meter.

Losiewicz’s margin of victory
was even more impressive in_the
discus, where his throw nearly
ended up in a different area code
than everyone else’s. Losiewicz had
a throw of 50.3 meters, while the
next—best toss was a mere 42.1.

For the women, Joetta Purter
has been one of the Panthers’ most
valuable performers all season long,
and she showed why on Saturday.

Purter blew the field away in
the 400-meter hurdles, winning the
event by more than three seconds
with a time of 59.35 seconds. That

With just over 100 meters to go, she
pulled even with the Essex anchor
but was unable to keep up during
the final sprint.

Trecia Smith, as usual, was the
Panthers’ star in the field. A lack of
competition didn’t slow her down
—— her long jump of 21-3 estab-
lished a new meet record and was
nearly four feet longer than the sec-
ond-place jump.

events added to this year’s meet.

Staff Writer

The Pitt 0’ women’s softball
team ended its season on another

sour note Saturday — two
losses at Cleveland State gave
the Panthers a season record
of 0-12 in their first year of
play. ‘

The Panthers lost both
games of the doubleheader 8-
0.

In game one, Pitt pitcher

Shelby Scrabis gave up nine
hits and eight runs, in pitch-
ing a complete game. The
Panthers as a team had a total
of three errors, outpacing
their team total of hits (two).
The Vikings had no errors,
and put up nine hits to go
along with six walks given up
by Scrabis.

Game two at Cleveland
State was like déja vu for
Pittsburgh. The only differ-
ence was that in this game, the
Panthers could not conjure up

any hits. Cleveland State’s Kim
Evans won the no-hitter and
missed a perfect game by allow-
ing only one walk, which went to

Pitt pitcher Laura LeViere,
on the other hand, gave up seven
hits, six walks and eight runs.

It clearly was not a sunny

On Thursday, Pitt had a total
of two hits in the first game. St.
rancis clinched the game by the
third inning, when Autum Helsel
hit a three—run homer.
Although the first game
of the doubleheader seemed
rough for the Panthers,
pitcher LeViere provided
the bright spot, recording
12 strikeouts for the game.
I This contest was also one of
the Panthers’ only games
this season in which they
did not commit any errors.
But, in the second game
against the Red Flash, Pitt
§ did not enjoy a similar
defensive effort. Instead,
the Panthers had a total of
eight errors, allowing the
Red Flash to roll over them
with a score of 8-0 at the

The economic crisis sweeping through Asia has thrown millions out of work. In
the U.S., while the stock market sets records, 30 million Americans go hungry. How
can we ﬁght back?

This is what the summer school is about with more than 70 discussions on labor
' women’s liberation, the socialist tradition and more.

(a vagabond drinking from a puddle), to
the ridiculous (a motorcycle racing
through a house), to the frightening (see-
ing a student get smacked by a PAT bus
on Fifth Avenue).

But more than these, my memories
are of sports:

- Seeing Curtis Martin rush for over
200 yards at my first Pitt game, and then
seeing Pitt lose in the final seconds;

0 The 1995 Homecoming loss to West
Virginia, in which Pitt came back from 21
points down only to lose on a Hail Mary
touchdown on the second-to-last play of
the game;

0 Pitt basketball’s overtime loss to
top-ranked UMass two years ago — the
Field House hasn’t rocked that hard since;

0 Vonteego Cummings’ game-winning
jumper to beat Connecticut in the first
round of last year’s Big East Tournament;

- Going to last year’s Thursday night
Halloween Homecoming dressed as a mix
between a pimp and a punk rocker;

0 Then, of course, there is this year’s
Homecoming win over nationally ranked
Miami — the destruction of a goal post at
Pitt Stadium was unfathomable until that
night;

I will kick myself forever for not
going to this year’s Backyard Brawl, but I
honestly don’t think I would have been
able to restrain myself from cheering in
the press box.

And ﬁnally, my proudest moment as a
Panther was being part of the partying
and cheering on Beale Street down in

THE PITT NEWS

Memphis. The photo of what seemed like
thousands of Pitt fans chanting “Let’s go
Pitt!” and “Penn State sucks!” should be
given to the admissions office to entice
high school kids to come here.

As I leave this place, I hope it contin-
ues on its current course. If the money
from the state produces a convocation
center, a new science building and a
revamped campus, Pitt will become an
elite public institution. And with the
University’s current leadership, I can
truly see this dream becoming a reality.

Working for this paper has honestly
been a lot of fun. Even though sometimes
the nights were long and work went unno-
ticed, it was worth it. Having a voice on
this campus, even if it was a small one,
was rewarding. For those readers who
responded to my opinions — whether it
was a retorting letter, a threatening phone
call or a friendly “Good article” —— I
appreciate it. A response whether good or
bad means so much to a writer.

Now that I’m done babbling, I’d like
to thank some people. Mr. Lilley for
encouraging me to be your assistant and
teaching me a great deal. The Cup win-
ners for all the great times and being my
family when I needed one. Slost for mak-
ing me realize what I want in life. The
sports staff for making this a fun ride.
And this University for four awesome
years.

Matt Townsend is the assistant sports edi-
tor of The Pitt News and wishes every
graduate good luck on ﬁnding a good job
—— because it's damn hard.

before coaxing Notre Dame’s Jeff

Wagner to ground out and end the
inning. The Irish added one hit in
the last inning to total 14 in the
game.

In game two, the Panthers
took another offensive beating but
did manage to tally a run off the
dominating Irish pitching staff.

Notre Dame quickly took the
lead in the top of the second after
Porzel slammed a three-run
homer. First baseman Dan
Leatherman then led off the fourth
with another dinger; center fielder
Allen Greene followed his act
with a leadoff home un in the top
of the fifth. The Irish added two
more runs in the fifth inning after
an RBI double by right fielder
Jeff Kelker. Pitt’s Jory
Coughenour came in to relieve
starter Kevin Lazeski midway
through the frame, and finally
coaxed a double play to end the
inning.

However, Coughenour got his
share of Irish power in the sev-
enth, as Wagner sent a 400-plus-
foot home run over the centerfield
wall to give Notre Dame an eight-
run lead.

In the eighth inning,
Coughenour was replaced by
freshman Scott Schultz, after

yielding back—to—back doubles by
second baseman Todd Frye and
right fielder Jeff Perconte. Third
baseman Brant Ust then ripped a
two-RBI single to the outfield,
giving the Irish a 12-run lead.
Lidge, the Notre Dame
starter, was clocked at up to 93
mph and shut down the Panthers
through seven innings, giving up
only two hits before being
relieved by sophomore pitcher
Steve Szczepanski in the eighth.
The Panthers finally retaliat-
ed, with Lidge out of the game,
with some offense of their own in
the bottom half of the eighth.
Freshman right fielder Chris
Kopp singled to lead off the
inning. Catcher David Hoopes
advanced Kopp with a single of
his own. After an error by Notre
Dame’s third baseman that loaded
the bases, first baseman Jason
Oliver grounded into a double
play, scoring Kopp for Pitt’s first
run of the doubleheader.
Szczepanski escaped the
inning, and Irish reliever Scott
Cavey entered the contest in the
ninth, striking out the side to
close the door on the Panthers.
The doubleheader sweep
dropped the Panthers’ record to 8-
21-1 overall, 2-14 in the Big East.
The Panthers take this week
off due to final exams and return
to action on Tuesday, April 28 at
Youngstown State.

Choosing a place to live is difficult but very
important and deserves the investment of your
time. We suggest you compare numerous
apartments. check out the reputations of the
landlords, and talk to the existing tenants when
the landlord is not there. To start you off on
the “right” track, call our number (24 hours)
and leave your name and address ( and your
parents?) so that we may mail you detailed
information for your consideration.
