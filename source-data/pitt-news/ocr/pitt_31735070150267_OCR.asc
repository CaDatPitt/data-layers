FOOTBALL

Pitt returns
to familiar
place for

bowl game

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

For the third consecutive year, the
Pitt football team will ﬁnish its
season in Birmingham, Ala.

After beating Kentucky two
years ago and then losing to
Southern Methodist last season,
the Panthers will return to the
BBVA Compass Bowl yet again,
this time to face Ole Miss from
the Southeastern Conference at
Legion Fieldjan. 5, 2013, at 1 p.m.

The Rebels (6-6, 3-5 SEC) are
coming off an impressive 41-24
triumph over in-state rival Mis-
sissippi State in what is known as
the Egg Bowl.

Similarly, the Panthers (6-6,
3-4 Big East) won their last game
of the regular season to become
bowl eligible, defeating South
Florida 27-3 Saturday night.

Following the comprehensive
Pitt victory, rumors began circu-
lating that the Panthers would face
off against rival West Virginia in
the Pinstripe Bowl at Yankee Sta-
dium in New York City. But Sunday
afternoon, news surfaced that the
Pinstripe Bowl selection commit-
tee had instead invited Syracuse to
the bowl to face the Mountaineers.

That left Pitt with two possible
destinations: the BBVA Compass
Bowl or the Beef ‘O’ Brady’s Bowl
in St. Petersburg, Fla.

Hopes that the Panthers would
avoid a third straight trip to Bir-
mingham’s uninspiring bowl game

World AIDS Day raises awareness

Many Velez
Staff Writer

Pamela Smith stood in front of
a group of about 100 people in a
Carnegie Mellon auditorium last
Saturday night to tell her survival
story.

“I am someone that is living
with HIV. I have been living with
HIV for 24‘ years,” said Smith, clad
in a Pittsburgh Red T—shirt and
bright red boots, to her audience.
“I am putting aface on this disease.”

Smith works as an assistant li-

aison for the Girlfriends Outreach,
a health education program for the
Pittsburgh community and a sub-
set of the Pittsburgh AIDS Task
Force. Smith discovered she had
AIDS at her doctor’s office during
a full physical examination and
has been medicated for the past
18 years. The lifestyle she lived,
which she declined to comment on
further, put her at very high risk,
she said.“This disease isn’t taking
control of my life,” Smith said. “I
am controlling it.” »
Smith was chosen to speak,

along with Mayor Luke Ravenstahl
and LGBTQ counseling services
Persad Center" representative and
AIDS survivor Branden Dudek, as
part of the World AIDS Day rally
that kicked off at Carnegie Mellon
University Saturday night with an
event.

that promote awareness and pro-
vide services to those with the dis-
ease, organized the event with the

Port
Authority
extends
agreement

0 o
with Pitt
Cassidy Davis
Stqff Writer

Pitt students and employees will
still be able to take advantage of
unlimited transportation around
Pittsburgh with the tap of their
Pitt IDs.

Pitt and Port Authority reached
an agreement Friday to continue
the U-Pass program — which pro-
vides prepaid unlimited transit
rides to about 40,000 students,
faculty and staff — for another
ﬁve years.

The Port Authority’s board of
directors came to an agreement
that includes annual reimburse-
ments by the University based
on the number of Pitt-related bus
riders who choose to ride public
transportation. This new agree-
ment retroactively begins as of
July 1, 2012, and continues until
June 30, 2017, when authorities
will have to meet again and discuss
whether they want to continue the
partnership.

Over the last ﬁve years, the Uni-
versity has increased payments
toward Port Authority by more
than 50 percent and is predicted
to continue increasing those pay-
ments.

“Our collaboration with the
University of Pittsburgh as the
ﬁrst large-scale smart card part-
ner has been incredibly valuable,
and we are extremely pleased to
continue this partnership,” Steve

Pitt offers services for students
to relieve finals week stress

Kathleen Fennell
Szfqff H/rz‘ter

Whether it’s shaking it up at a Zumba class,
singing some golden oldies during karaoke
or striking a posein a yoga session, Pitt
students are sure to ﬁnd a way to deﬂect the
stress of ﬁnals week this year.

Pitt Program Council and the Stress Free
Zone have both assembled a variety of free
activities for students to rid themselves of
stress in a healthy way before and during
ﬁnals week. PPC will fund all of the activi-
ties taking place over Finals Survival Week
—— traditionally held the week before ﬁnals
week each semester — out of the budget al-
lotted to the organization from the Student
Activities Fund.

Jaimi Ross, the leisure learning director
for Pitt Program Council, emphasized the
importance of staying healthy to prepare
for ﬁnals week.

“The ﬁrst part of studying for ﬁnals is a

taking care of yourself and making sure that
you yourself are healthy, eating correctly,
sleeping correctly and working out, so that
way, your brain can actually absorb all the
information you’re cramming in during that
one week,” Ross said.

PPC will be hosting free events through-
out the week leading up to ﬁnals to help
students relax and survive their tests. In-
cluded among the events are massages tak-
ing place between 12 and 3 p.m. Monday
and art projects taking place between 1 and
3 p.m. Thursday. Both events will be held
in the William Pitt Union Assembly room.

Ross said that in the past she has seen
large turnouts for the events leading up to
ﬁnals.

“People kind of look forward to Finals
Survival Week just because they know it’s a

de—stress week before ﬁnals to kind of have
fun, win prizes and work out,” she said.

Deanna Burkett, the Outreach and Con-
sultation Coordinator forthe University of
Pittsburgh Counseling Center, which runs
the Stress Free Zone, offered some infor-
mation about the Zone’s approach to ﬁnals
week.

Burkett emphasized the importance of
seeking help to relieve stress during ﬁnals
week.

“In high—stress times it can be very dif-
ﬁcult to relax on our own,” Burkett said in
an email. “The mind gets chaotic, and even
when we try to relax, we just end up thinking
about what is stressing us out.”

The Stress Free Zone, located on the low-
er level of the Union, will offer yoga classes at
least once a day Monday through Thursday
between 2 and 3 p.m. along with meditation
classes between 7 and 8 p.m. Wednesday
and Thursday.

“If students do not feel able to take 45
minutes away from their studies, we also
have wa1k—in hours during which students
can come in and take a shorter break,” Bur-
kett said. ‘

Burkett advised students to avoid un-
healthy de—stressing methods she has wit-
nessed in the past.

“I think the most common unhealthy
coping strategy I see in students is alcohol
use. When a student has an anxious mind,
alcohol can seem like a quick ﬁx,” she said.

She then explained that alcohol can cause
problems for students, such as depressed
feelings and sluggish minds.

Burkett said the Stress Free Zone does not
traditionally witness an increase in partici-
pation during ﬁnals week, and she attributes
this to students’ lack of self—care.

“In high—stress times, self—care is often

the ﬁrst thing to be sacriﬁced,” she said. “We
are trying in the coming weeks to remind
students that we are here and ready to help.”

Some students, including senior Yami—
nah Romulus, are happy that Pitt provides
opportunities for students to relieve stress.
Romulus majors in biology and Spanish and
has ﬁve ﬁnals to worry about this semester.

“It’s deﬁnitely nice knowing we have
places to go. Finals week can be very over-
whelming, so it’s nice to know that there
are places you can go to get yourself back
together,” Romulus said.

Although Romulus hasn’t attended any
PPC Finals Survival events since her fresh-
man year, she said that she might go this
year.

“Ifl feel like I’m really too stressed out, I
might consider going,” Romulus said.

However, other students hesitate to take
time out of their-study schedule to partici-
pate in these events.

Jessie Hibel, a sophomore global manage-
ment major, said some students might not
have enough time in their day to study and

also de—stress.

“I think it’s a good idea, butI don’t know
if anyone is going to have time, realistically,”
Hibel said.

Drew Ackerman, a sophomore double
majoring in urban studies and political sci-
ence, said the circumstances would have
to be just right for her to make it to one of
the PPC events. _

“I’m sure if there was one that appealed
to me, I would go if I knew about it and had
the time. A lot of things have to line up,”
Ackerman said.

Ross also encouraged students to take
advantage of other resources on campus
such as the Counseling Center, located on
the third ﬂoor of the William Pitt Union,
and Healthy U, a division of Student Affairs
that educates students about exercise and
nutrition.

AGREEMENT

Bland, CEO of Port Authority, said in a press
release Friday.

For each ID tapped on the farebox, Pitt
owes Port Authority half of the one—zone
base fare, which is currently $2.50 per ride.
If this one-zone base fare were to increase,
the reimbursement rate would follow suit
with a maximum cap.

Full-time Pitt students currently pay $180
each year as part of the safety, security and
transportation fee, which includes the abil-
ity to ride Port Authority transportation.

Last year Panther Cards became compat-
ible with the buses’ ConnectCard system,
which allows students to tap their IDs to a
card reader on the bus instead of ﬂashing
their IDs to the drivers. The system can also
measure ridership.

Pitt is not the only university that takes
advantage of Port Authority’s U—Pass pro-
gram. Students from the three major univer-

sities surrounding Oakland comprise about
11 percent of the population of riders who
utilize Port Authority transportation. Along-
side Pitt students, Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity and Chatham University students help
make up that 11 percent, or about 600,000
trips per month.

“We’re delighted to continue our partner-
ship with the Port Authority on the prepaid
rider program that provides so many ben-
eﬁts to Pitt, to the Port Authority and to
the community,” Jerome Cochran, execu-
tive vice chancellor and general counsel at
the University of Pittsburgh, said in a press
release. “As we are proud to say, the city
is our campus, and this program provides
our students with easy and efﬁcient trans-
portation, enabling them to experience the
cultural and civic amenities of living in a
vibrant city like Pittsburgh.”

Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele said that U-
Pass has been a successful program for both

’ organizations, but Pitt is not yet speculating

whether or not it will renew the program
again in 2017 since it is so far in the future. I

student groups. More than 200 students and
community members took part Saturday.
Ravenstahl said on Saturday that four
years ago he took the “bull by the horns”
when it came to HIV and AIDS awareness in

education,” Hoffmann said.

He said students don’t take enough advan-
tage of resources outside of Oakland, and he
hopes to help students realize this through
the Pitt chapter of PATF.

“A big problem is that people think it’s
chronic and don’t take it seriously,” Hoff-
mann said. “HIV kills people daily, and if it
doesn’t kill you, your life won’t be the same.”

Following the speeches, students and

held lit candles and yelled chants, such as
“Black, White, Gay, Straight, AIDS does not
discriminate’? while walking down Forbes
Avenue.

Pitt’s Pittsbugh AIDS Task Force group
helped plan the rally and has 18 members
serving as student ambassadors. The chapter
became accredited this semester, with senior
Topher Hoffmann as president. Hoffmann

Bryan said the AIDS rate in Pittsburgh has
increased over the years.

Bryan said the best thing students can do
“is get tested and know their status.”

EDITORIAL A THE STAMATTACK

The Wﬂﬁmn Pitt Union pianos

 

Editor

Nick Stamatakis
Assistant Opinions Editor

Walking into the William Pitt
Union every day, two things are

clear. One, the giant neon “art-

work” above the food court show-
casing the Cathedral of Learning
and Pitt Panther looks super classy
in 2012.

Two, a bunch of people at Pitt
can’t play piano.

Anybody who has spent just a
few moments in the Union quickly
becomes aware of the slightly out-
of—tune piano on the Main Floor in
the Jazz Hall of Fame. While the
piano does play host to the oc-
casional Beethoven or Billy Joel,
there are just as many student
piano players with skills only just
barely eclipsing Nora, YouTube’s
piano—playing cat superstar.

Unlike cats, however, who seem
content with demurely stroking

represent everything good in the world

It’s only a slight exaggeration to say this piano couid solve all of the wor¥d’s problems. Kenny Ong |Visua|

the keys, many of the people play-
ing in the Union prefer ajackham-
mer approach to playing. This is
especially true if the pianists don’t
actually know the songs they are
playing: what better way to com-
pensate for not knowing that song
you learned in second grade than
by playing the part you do “know”
extra loud? Thirty times.

But as annoying as it can be at
times, that piano should never be
moved. That piano has a powerful
positive psychological role on this
campus. It serves a useful check
to many of the worst social ills of
modern society.

It reminds us life isn’t all about
comfort. As middle—class, college-
educated Americans, this is easy to
forget. Basic things like hot water
and electricity take most of the
bite out of life, and hordes of in-
dustrial designers fashion entire
careers out of making incremental
improvements to consumables and

technology for the sole purpose of
reducing eye strain, eliminating
confusing technical procedures
or advancing general ergonomics.

I wouldn’t give back any of
these improvements. But do we re—
ally need to steamroll everything
even just a bit annoying out of
our lives? As Princeton professor
Christy Wampole said in a recent
essay in The New York Times, our
lives of comfort may be leading
to our generation’s “rampant sar-
casm and unapologetic cultivation
of silliness,” a “mode of living” she
calls “not viable.”

Her point makes sense. Few
meaningful social movements or
innovations seem to be springing
forth from our world of #ﬁrst—
worldproblems; the Tea Party
and Occupy Wall Street move-
ments have utterly failed at doing
anything more than starting jokes

about teabagging and smelly communists.

And while bad piano playing is prob-
ably a quintessential ﬁrst—world problem,
removing it would just be another step
toward making the world a metaphorical
bouncy castle. Keeping it keeps our feet
on the ground.

Deeper than improving our campus’ tol~
erance for discomfort, though, is the piano’s
representation of our fragile society.

Much of our lives are lived in a mild form
of mutually assured destruction. Absent
certain moral reservations, given a strong
enough social shift, the strongest could

could rule.

Obviously, society keeps most of this
in check. Less dramatically and at a per-
sonal level, it also keeps us graceful around
people we really don’t like or really do like,
preventing us from following our urges to
toss insults, ﬁsts or bodies at each other.

This social capital has long been docu-
mented to have positive effects on the eco-
nomic and emotional well—being of a state.
Laws and regulations are not what keep
things moving smoothly; social stability and
order are key + just look at the differences
between Sweden and Greece. ‘ »

The William Pitt Union piano embodies
this balance. A user of a public piano must
balance the desire to play the same four

expectations of those near the piano. With-
out strict rules regarding decibels or style,
the player attempts to reach some kind of
social equilibrium.

Often this balance fails, and visitors to
the lobby lay vanquished by an atonal in-
terpretation of Sara Bareilles. But many
times, a violinist will join, and the lobby
gets treated to a calming sonata. We mo-
mentarily stop the bustle and, for a few
moments, take time to listen.

Either way, we all get to practice society

with our training wheels on. With the only ‘

downside being a few unpleasant minutes,
the upside is one step further along the path
._ to becoming civic-minded citizens who fully
embrace the richness of one another. These

not capable of solving the Israel-Palestine
conﬂict, are just as civically important as
voting or volunteering. '

In fact, the Pitt campus would be a much
better place with more pianos in building.
lobbies. Imagine Benedum Hall or David"
Lawrence Hall with a piano in the lobby.
Dozens of little experiments in socializa-

But until then, we will have to content
ourselves with the William Pitt Union piano. T

In addition to giving amateur musicians if

of-tune piano. I

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

To the Editor,

I am writing in response to the article published-Tuesday, Nov. 27, about Tucker
Max’s visit to Pitt. 1 was one of the protesters gathered in the Union and am writing
this letter because the views of the protesters, as well as students who couldn’t make
it to the protest, were inaccurately represented. We were portrayed as being upset
because Max swears and parties. That is not why we were upset. s

We protested the event because Max’s.claim to fame is his published storiestof
his sexual conquests. These stories are disrespectful toward women at their best,
and at their worst, they contain issuersrregarding consent. Max has written about
videotaping sex with a girl whofdidn’t know a video was being taken.fHe admits to
coercing girls into sexual practices with which they were uncomfortable. And not
only does he admit it, he parades it — and he has made huge sums of money from it.

the University, the Council gave the message that Max’s behaviors were OK, which

is horrifying. I urge PPC to be more mindful the next time members want to bring as

controversial speaker and to consider whether the benefits outweigh the potential
negatives. In this case, the answer for me, and for everyone else who protested the
,event,v-was,an obvious no. PPC should have seen this too.

Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences

To the Editor,

I was never more disappointed in my university than last Monday night with its
use of my tuition money or that of my classmates.

Tucker Max’s “controversy” —— which was never explained in the Tuesday article
covering the event — is more than just his love of partying. On his website, Max
admits to coercing his drunken girlfriend into anal sex, which she had been con-
tinuously denying him.

 .. That is sexual assault.

Pitt invited a speaker who admitted to sexual assault and used my tuition money?
to pay for it. This is equal to tolerating what he has done.

This is an insult to all female students. .

This University is supposed to promote a code of civility. He also strayed far
from his promised topic of following one’s dreams and even happily said that he
has “in no way recanted.”

Rachel Peters
Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences

- . To the Editor,
When Pitt Program Council paid Max Pitt students’ money to come and speak at ;i_,'-I; « .
t is f ‘Eric Baldwin’s column last Wednesday, “Israel’s actions justified in the ﬁght fof ”
"-democracy,” presents a one-sided, considerably weak argument. Although I can

understand why it is important for the U.S. to support Israel —— a strong ally sur-
rounded by some hostile neighbors — he fails to acknowledge that Israeli action
has contributed to this hostility. Furthermore, just because a country considers
itself to be a democracy does not mean that other democratic countries must give
it a carte blanche to commit human rights abuses in the name of defending itself.
One can argue that such actions undermine the principles of democracy and are

counterintuitive to spreading democracy in the region. In addition, cherry picking

quotes by radicals cannot be used as justification for Israel’s offensive position. Are
you advocating, as Gilad Sharon so crudely stated, that to defend itself, Israel must
“ﬂatten entire neighborhoods in Gaza. Flatten all of Gaza. The Americans didn’t
stop with Hiroshima — the Japanese weren’t surrendering fast enough, so they hit )
Nagasaki, too”?

Panthers recover from slow start to

The Pitt men’s basketball team
earned its 1,500th win in program
history on Saturday night.

But the victory wasn’t an easy

~ one for the Panthers.

Pitt (7-1) trailed by eight points
at halftime before rallying with an
impressive second—half perfor-
mance to defeat the visiting Detroit
Titans (2-4) by a ﬁnal score of 74-61
at the Petersen Events Center.

Pitt jumped out to an early lead
on a Steven Adams layup and a
thunderous dunk by Talib Zanna.
But the Panthers seemed to lose all

of their early momentum for the
remainder of the ﬁrst half as they
struggled to cope with Detroit’s
sagging 2-3 zone defense.

“We obviously did not play
well enough in the ﬁrst half, but
attacked the zone better in the sec-
ond half,” Pitt head coach Jamie
Dixon said after the game. “I’ve said
in the past that we are not yet good
enough against the zone. Our guys
are not comfortable in it.”

Detroit’s defense completely
stiﬂed the ball movement of the
Panthers around the arc. The team
struggled to ﬁnd an open shot,
and Pitt’s big men under the hoop
struggled to ﬁnd space.

After Adams’ opening points,
the freshman center did not score
again. Senior forward Dante Taylor
entered the game but ﬁnished with
zero points and only one rebound.

“We can deﬁnitely attack the
zone a lot better,” Pitt senior guard
Tray Woodall said.

Dixon cited several ﬁrst-half
issues that plagued the Panthers’
play: lax defense, slow-moving
players on the perimeter, a failure
to rebound adequately and Wood-
all’s three early fouls.

Dominating victory earns

Pitt another bowl berth

Pat McAteer
Assistant News Editor

In head coach Paul Chryst’s ﬁrst
season, the Pitt football team en-
dured embarrassing losses like
the one to Football Championship
Subdivision—school Youngstown
State and near misses like the
triple-overtime defeat against
national championship game
participant Notre Dame.

But despite the disappoint-
ment and drama, the Panthers
(6—6, 3-4 Big East) will play in
their ﬁfth straight bowl game —
and third straight BBVA Compass
Bowl — after a decisive 27-3 vic-
tory over a struggling South Flor-
ida, (3-9, 1-6 Big East) Saturday
night at RaymondJames Stadium
in Tampa, Fla.

Pitt senior quarterback Tino
Sunseri, who has received his
fair share of criticism through-

out his three years as a starter,
led the team yet again, passing
for 211 yards with a touchdown
and eclipsing the 3,000-yard
mark. And senior running back
Ray Graham passed the 1,000-
yard mark for the ﬁrst time in his
career, rushing for 93 yards and
two touchdowns as Pitt crushed
the Bulls to ﬁnish the regular sea-
son. It became clear early on that
South Florida was outmatched by
the battle-tested Panthers.

After an unsuccessful opening
drive by Pitt, junior safety Jason
Hendricks intercepted a pass
from South Florida quarterback
Matt Floyd and returned it to the
Bulls’ 21-yard line.

Eight plays later, Graham

punched it infrorn one yard out. .

Pitt upsets Virginia
Tech with walk-off pin

Dustin Gabler
Senior Stcyff Writer

It took two pins by Pitt’s No. 9
Zac Thomusseit in overtime of his
match to seal a come-from-behind
win for the No. 18 Pitt wrestling
team over No. 11 Virginia Tech,
18-16. The win gives the Panthers
their ﬁrst dual-match win of the
year.

In the last match of the night,
the redshirt senior heavyweight
appeared to pin Virginia Tech’s
David Marone as the ﬁrst sudden-
victory period was winding down.
After signaling the pin, the referee
discussed with the review official
whether it beat the period-ending
whistle. The fall was waved off

The Panthers (1-2) entered
Thomusseit’s match trailing 16-12,
needing a major decision (worth
four points) to earn a tie or a pin
(worth six points) for the victory.

After Thomusseit’s near pin, it ap-
peared that he would just squeak
out a win but not earn the team
win.

With time ticking down in the
ﬁrst overtime ride—out, Thomus-
seit pulled off a reversal straight
into the match-winning pin to earn
the Panthers six team points and
the stunning win, as the nearly
ﬁlled Fitzgerald Field House ex-
ploded with applause.

The exciting ending made up
for what was once again a poor
showing from the Pitt lower-
weight-class wrestlers.

At 125 pounds, redshirt fresh-
man Derrick Nelson got his ﬁrst
start of the season and his career.
His task wasn’t easy, though, as he

Pitt’s five-game winning

  streak ends at Lafayette

Pitt head coach Agnus Berenato remains one win short of tying the school record after
the Panthers’ frustrating loss. Huailei Wang | Senior Staff Photographer

Dave Uhrmacher
Staff Writer

A second-half surge by the Pitt women’s
basketball team came up just short on
Saturday as the Panthers (5-2) dropped
their first road contest of the year to the
Lafayette Leopards, 68-65.

The narrow defeat at the Kirby Sports
Center in Easton, Pa., ended Pitt’s five-
game winning streak and prevented head
coach Agnus Berenato from tying with
Kirk Bruce on the Panthers’ all—time
coaching wins list.

The Leopards’ 3-point shooting (10-
for—20) proved too much to handle for
the Panthers. After sinking six 3-pointers
in the first half, Lafayette (3-5) came out
shooting again, drilling four from beyond
the arc in the second half.

Down 36-28 at the half, the Panthers

were able to battle back throughout the T

second half. But after tying the game at 56
with six minutes to go, two late 3-pointers

by Lafayette’s Linnel Macklin sunk Pitt’s,

comeback attempt. , p

“I was really disappointed that we
were so tentative in the last couplernin-
utes,” Coach Berenato said after the game.
“We didn’t seize the moment. That’s when
youiknow you’ve grown up. We did it at
home. We just couldn’t do it on the road.”

Sophomore guard Brianna Kiesel led

the Panthers’ offensive effort with 17

points and five rebounds. She said Pitt’s
second-half effort was good,‘ but that La-
fayette just made too many shots.

“We worked hard in the second half,”
Kiesel said. “They shot the ball really
well: They really wanted to win. We just
have to look at what we could have done
differently and focus on what we‘ can do
better for Wednesday.”

Cora McManus was one of three play-
ers to score 12 points for the Panthers
on Saturday, joining teammates Ashlee
Anderson and Asia Logan. McManus be-
lieves the team needs to focus on improv-
ing its rebounding.

“We really tried to attack the inside,
and I was receiving good entry passes
from the guards, getting my shot and
finishing,” the sophomore forward said.
“But defensively, we need to box out and
make sure they only have one opportunity
to score on offense.” ' ‘

Pitt was outrebounded 39-34 by the
Leopards. ,

The Panthers will look to extend
their five—game home winning streak on
Wednesday and to grab the victory that
will push Coach Berenato into a tie atop
the wins list. Pitt hosts Loyola (Md.) at
7 p.—m. at the Petersen Events Center. I

Pitt outgained the depleted USF team in
yardage 327 to 115. The Bulls, who lost star
quarterback B.J. Daniels for three weeks
to an ankle injury he suffered while play-
ing against Connecticut, committed four
turnovers, giving the Pitt offense solid ﬁeld
position on multiple occasions during the

game.

Led by Sunseri and Graham, the Pan-
thers took advantage of South Florida’s

mistakes.

Entering the second half with a 13-0
lead, Pitt quickly shut down the Bulls’ of-
fense, ending the drive with a sack by junior
defensive tackle Aaron Donald.

Pitt sophomore receiver Ronald Jones,
who was playing in place of suspended
Panther senior Cam Saddler, returned the
ensuing punt to the Bulls’ 31-yard line, and
__‘_ Graham scored on another 1-yard rush nine

plays later to put Pitt ahead 20-0.

Pitt senior wide receiver Mike Shanahan
shined Saturday night in front of an an-
nounced crowd of 35,341, catching nine
passes for 116 yards.

For USF, the performance was one the
team will likely hope to forget.

Starting in place of Daniels, Floyd passed
for 93 yards with three_ interceptions and
just 12 completions. The Bulls’ running
game didn’t fare much better, with Deme-
tris Murray gaining only 13 yards on 12
attempts.

A strong performance by Pitt’s defense
stiﬂed USF’s offense. Donald and the rest
of the Panther front seven prevented the
Bulls from establishing any sort of sus-
tained attack.

The Bulls’ only points on the board came
from a 26-yard ﬁeld goal by kicker Mai-
kon Bonani — to which the crowd booed
— when Pitt led 27-0 with 5:08 left in the
fourth quarter.

With the loss to Pitt, South Florida ﬁn-
ished the season losing nine of its ﬁnal 10
games, and there have been suggestions
that head coach Skip Holtz won’t be return-
ing next year.

After becoming bowl eligible, the Pan-
thers will now return to the BBVA Compass

time to face Ole Miss from the Southeast-

ern Conference onjan. 5, 2013 at 1 p.m. at

a 14-3 victory, earning an important four
team points for the Hokies.

No. 7 Shelton Mack at 133 pounds wres-

Erik Spjut. Mack earned a takedown but was
unable to hold Spjut down for long. Spjut had
two escapes in the match to even the score
before the start of the third period. Mack
escaped early in the third period and held on
to the lead, despite receiving a stall warning.

The next three matches were all struggles
for the Panthers, but there was one positive:
Pitt’s wrestlers at 141, 149 and 157 pounds
all avoided giving up any bonus team points
to the Hokies.

No. 10 Zach Neibert of Virginia Tech
didn’t wrestle his best match against Pitt’s
Travis Shaffer, who led 3-2 entering the third
period. But Shaffer had a poorthird period,
allowing an escape, giving up three back
points and losing the riding-time point.
Neibert emerged as the 7-3 victor.

Pitt redshirt senior Donnie Tasser also
took on a No. 10 wrestler in the Hokies’ Nick
Brascetta. Tasser was dominated early by
Brascetta, who jumped out to a 7-1 lead in
the ﬁrst period. The next two periods were
much closer, and the score ended as a 10-3
win for Brascetta to give Virginia Tech a lead
by the same score. .

At 157 pounds, Pitt’s Troy Reaghard took
on No. 8]esse Dong. In another seven—point
victory, Dong defeated Reaghard 9-2. Win-
ning by seven points is signiﬁcant because
an eight-point win earns the victorious
wrestler four points for his team instead
of the three.

 

The match of the night and the poten-
tial swing match came at 165 pounds. It
was the night’s only matchup of two ranked
wrestlers. No. 4 Pete Yates, Virginia Tech’s
highest-ranked wrestler, faced off against
Pitt’s No. 11 Tyler Wilps.

The wrestlers were tied at two following
two Wilps escapes and one takedown for

» Yates. In the third period, Yates escaped and
secured the riding time point for a 4-2 win. -

With four matches remaining, Pitt trailed
the Hokies 16-3 and desperately needed to
begin its comeback attempt.

Nick Bonaccorsi and Austin Gabel
went to sudden victory after wrestling to
a 1-1 tie. While both wrestlers were close
to takedowns in sudden victory, neither
could ﬁnish it off. After each escaped in the
two overtime periods, they entered another
sudden victory period. Gabel was hit with
a stalling call, giving Bonaccorsi and the
Panthers the win, 3-2.

Pitt turned to No. 14 184—pounder Max,

Thomusseit to keep the momentum rolling.
With a third-period takedown, he defeated
Nick Vetterlein 3-1.

With its best wrestler taking the mat
next, Pitt looked to get a bonus point back.
No. 2 197—pounder Matt Wilps cruised
through Derrick Borlie, but he couldn’t get
anything better than an 8-2 victory, leaving
it all up to Zac Thomusseit._The Panthers
needed a major decision or pin to salvage
anything from the tight match.

The Pitt heavyweight didn’t let the team
down and came up with the big pin for the
Panthers.

Moving forward from the win, Pitt will
look to earn another home victory against
a future ACC foe next Friday night, when
it hosts Maryland at the Fitzgerald Field
House. ﬂ

got to do a better job of coaching them. That’s
,, something I’m well aware of,” Dixon said.

Pitt outrebounded Detroit by a slim mar-
gin of 31-30, while allowing the Titans to grab
10 rebounds on the offensive end.

Though Pitt generally dominates the
boards, a failure to box out and put bodies on
Titan offensive players proved problematic.

”‘ ‘ Luckily for Pitt, the team that took to the
court for the second half seemed to be a new
and improved Panthers team.

“We tried to come out with a little more
intensity on defense and be more aware of
their shooters,” Woodall said.

I

Freshman point guard James Robinson
said the team stuck to its game plan after
the ﬁrst half, but it simply executed better.

“We were able to swing the ball a little
faster and attack the gaps to get things mov-
ing,” Robinson said.

Zanna provided a spark for the Panthers
in the middle of the second half as Pitt out-
scored the Titans 45-24 in the game’s ﬁnal 20
minutes. The junior forward ﬁnished with a
team-high 16 points, shooting 10-of-11 from
the free-throw line.

Junior Lamar Patterson contributed 12
points, and Robinson scored 11. "

“It’s easy for me [to feel conﬁdent] when I
have a lot of other great players on the court.
I rely on them a lot. They keep me calm out

there,” Robinson said. “I know I have four
other guys that have my back. We tried to put
awall up and stop penetration, but obviously
they hit some tough shots.”

Detroit head coach Ray McCallum Sr.
cited Woodall, who shot 4-for-5 from behind
the 3-point line, as another difference maker
for the Panthers.

“We wanted them to make contested
3s, and they did a great job of that tonight.
Woodall’s deep-corner 3 was the end for us,”
McCallum said.

McCallum credited the “inside-outside”
attack of the Panthers, and claimed it would
“carry them to a lot of victories.” He said he
feels that Pitt is an NCAA tournament team
this year. ‘

Showing resiliency, Pitt shot 64 percent
as a team from the ﬁeld in the second half,
and turned the ball over only four times.
The team ﬁnished with 18 total assists and
11 turnovers.

“I guess it’s better to have a better second
half than ﬁrst hal ,” Dixon joked. “Why didn’t
we do that in the ﬁrst half ‘? We’re not doing
it from the beginning, and I don’t know why

that is. That’s what we need to ﬁgure out.”

Pitt will take on cross-town rival
Duquesne in the annual City Game at Consol

Energy Center on Wednesday, Dec. 5. Tip—off ,

is set for 7 p.m. _

“It’s a great atmosphere there at Con-
sol. I’m looking forward to the City Game,”
Dixon said. I

BOWL “

were then dashed when Ball State announced it
had accepted abid to the Beef ‘O’ Brady’s Bowl.
In a news release, Pitt head coach Paul Chryst
said his team is excited to battle Mississippi.
“We’ve been given a great opportunity to
play a quality program like Ole Miss,” Coach
Chryst said. “I know they ﬁnished the season
strong and looked impressive in winning the
Egg Bowl against Mississippi State. We are ap-
preciative of the City of Birmingham and the
BBVA Compass Bowl for giving us the chance

“We’ve.been given
a great opportunity to
play a quality program

like Ole Miss."
Paul Chryst

to play one more game this season.”
Assuming Chryst remains at Pitt, it will be
the ﬁrst time the Panthers play in the familiar
bowl game with a permanent head coach.
Former defensive coordinator Phil Bennett
served as interim coach in Pitt’s 27-10 victory
over Kentucky in 2011 after Dave Wannstedt
resigned as head coach, and former defensive
coordinator Keith Patterson oversaw the Pan-
thers’ lackluster performance against SMU last

V season following Todd Graharn’s departure to

Arizona State.

Despite admitting that the situation is _

strange, Pitt athletic director Steve Pederson
still expressed his excitement for the game.

“While it is unusual to play in the same bowl
three years in a row, we are excited to be facing
a traditional program like Ole Miss,” Pederson
said. “This game is held in a great football city,
and our hosts have already discussed giving our
team some different experiences on this trip.”

The game, which will be televised on ESPN,
will be the ﬁrst ever football matchup between
the Pittsburgh Panthers and the Ole Miss Reb-
els. I
