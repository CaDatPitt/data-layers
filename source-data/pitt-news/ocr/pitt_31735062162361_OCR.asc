BY RITA VITOLO
The ﬁnancial crisis threatening
the survival’ of Lawrenceville’s
Arsenal Family and Children’s
Center may be alleviated in

Harrisburg soon due to the.

co-ordinatcd efforts of local legis-
lators and citizen ‘protest sparked
by the Center’s parents’ organiza-
tion.

Arsenal’s new hope stems’ from
an April 26 meeting, summoned at
the request of Congressman
William Moorhead after‘ his April
19 visit to the facility, that brought
local legislators together to discuss
possible state funding alternatives
for the Arsenal Center.

Meeting with the parents were
State Representative Joseph
Rhodes, State Senator Stanley
Noszka, Congressman H. John
Heinz III, Senator Hugh Scott, and
the Honorable Henry Kramer,
Judge of the Commonwealth Court
in Harrisburg. Representing the
State Senate Appropriations Com-
mittee was vice-chairman Eugene

  New Clue |rJ-Wc1tergote
Found byWc1|| St., Reported

 

BY SCOTT MACLEOD
Even in the midst of a
frightening and revealing week
involving President Nixon and his
private White House conversa-
tions, yet another_ clue in the
Watergate mystery has been
uncovered by a Wall Street Journal
investigative reporter. .
The discovery, directly ties

$50,000 Howard Hughes campaign
contribution delivered to the
President’s personal friend Bebe
Rebozo in March, 1970, to the still
unexplained break-in at Demo-
cratic Headquarters in June, 1972.
The break-in later became the
motivation for the alleged Water-
gate conspiracy and coverup which
is presently under investigation by
the special prosecutor's office and

the House Judiciary Committee

studying impeachment.

According to the Wall Street
Journal report published yester-
day, the link centrally involves a
$50,000 contribution [in the form of
a campaign gift to Rebozo] possibly
in return for a favorable anti-trust
-ruling from the Justice Depart-
ment, and also the White House
discovery that Democratic Com-
mittee Chairman Larry 0’Brian
was a Hughes consultant at the
time of that ruling. Hence, the
report said, the White House
ordered the Watergate conspir-
ators into the Democrats’ head-
quarters to learn of 0’Brian’s
possible knowledge of the trans-’

action, which he could use against ,

them as. r». political.‘ .eapon- 

 

The episode allegedly began in
the ‘fall of 1969 when Howard
Hughes after two recent attempts--
one successful--to acquire beyond
anti-trust regulations new hotels on
the Las Vegas strip. It was then
Hughes decided to obtain another
hotel, The Dunes, despite the
regulations, and rather than submit
the ~“business review letter,” as
Justice Department regulations
state, Hughes, in March 1970, sent
a top‘ lawyer straight to then
Attorney General John N. Mitchell.

The lawyer was Richard Danner,
a former- FBI agent who was the
man who introduced President
Nixon to Bebe Rebozo 27 years ago.

According to Danner’s own court
deposition, during a meeting at the
Justice Department, Mitchell gave
his pledge not to interfere with the
Hughes bid for another hotel on the
Strip.

It was later in the spring of 1970
that another Hughes associate,
Robert Maheu arranged for Danner
to deliver $50,000 to Bebe Rebozo
to meet what he called, according
to the Journal’s report, “political
obligations...as a result” of the
March meetings with Mitchell.

Then an angry falling out
between Hughes and Maheu in
December 1970, the report con-
tinued, allerted White House
aides. “Whether by coincidence or
not," the Journal, said, “H.R.
Haldeman...became interested in
Democratic Chairman Larry O’Bri-
an. Mr. O'Brian was a public

“The feeling among us when we
left that meeting was that the
problem now was a matter of where
the money would come from rather
than would we get it,” Dean said.

“A favorable decision from the
group means Arsenal’s existence is
assured for the year, and‘ we have
Congressman Moorhead’s guaran-
tee we could work at future funding
through them," she said. “The
money‘ we’re asking for now would
be a stop-gap to provide for
September funding.”

Unless the Arsenal Center can
ﬁnd funds to cover a $40,000
operating deﬁcit left over from the
current ﬁscal year, the 21-year-old
program originally modelled under
the guidance of Dr. Beniamin
Spock and other child-care leaders,
will be forced to close June 30.

Word is expected from the
Harrisburg group soon, possibly
within the week, Dean speculated.
Meanwhile, Chancellor Wesley
Posvar is scheduled to present the
University's position before the
Senate Appropriations Committee

_ at the state capital later this week.

The University. has been in
constant contact with Harrisburg
concerning Arsenal, according to
the Chancellor's Assistant for
Academic Affairs David R. Powers,
and is likewise seeking monies
from both state and foundation
sources to supplant the Univer-
sity's former role in the Arsenal
Center.

Although an unofficial announce-
ment of state funding for Arsenal
was leaked at the Center last
Wednesday, no official word has
been received as yet.

“The Chancellor has made a
commitment to continue faculty
support," said Ethel M. Tittnich,

community consultant for Arsenal 9

Center Affairs, “and if the
Mother's Club can come up with
the money. the decision to close

, Arsenal‘ will reverse.”

Already Arsenal’s plans to scrap
its traditional six-week summer
session have been cancelled and
the school is going. ahead with its
summer program of preschool and
after-school services scheduled to
last from June 24 until August 2,
pushing back the projected June 30

Pitt Prosecutions Soar

Crime Increase Denied

BY BILL HADUCK

The number of students prose-
cuted by the University Judicial
systems has increased 500% from
1972-73, but does not reﬂect an
increase in the number of crimes
committed in this period,,according
to University Student. Judicial
Systems Coordinator, Alden Bo-
wen.

‘‘In no way do I feel there has
been an increasesof misconduct by
students,” Bowen said. He noted
the number of cases prosecuted in
1973-74 was 150 while the

preceding year saw only 37 cases _

come before the Campus and
Residence Hall Judicial Boards.

Bowen attributes his belief to the
success of the system he initiated
two years ago. “The success of our
first year created an awareness
among the students and residence
hall staff.” More crimes are not
being committed; more crimes are
being reported, Bowen said.

‘.‘Even so,” he continued, “l50
cases prosecuted out of the 25,000
people we have here speaks highly
for the quality of the people."

Bowen's system is comprised of
two iudicial boards--campus and
residence _hall. ‘_‘Since students
living in the residence halls have
many different conditions than
commuting or off-campus students,
they must have their own set of
regulations." The Residence Hall
Judicial Board is comprised of 10
students while the Campus Judicial
Board has 12 members.

“The students sit in judgement
of their peers and it’s a very good
experience,” Bowen said, adding,
“I’m very pleased with the 22
students that comprise the boards
in that they accepted the responsi-
bility of seeing that we have a due
process system, that it is func-

tioned fairly, and that it protects
students rights at the same time. It
protects the larger.’ university
community from improper behavior
of the few students who refused to
comply and conform with univer-
sity regulations.”

MR. BOWEN:

 

Bowen also complimen'ted the
Student Government Legal Aware-
ness Committee for their part in
defense of prosecuted students.

He said they did an “outstanding

job.” .
He said, however, the end of
last term brought with it several
vacancies on both the Tudicial
boards and the Legal Awareness
- Committee. Applications are being
taken for the boards, according to‘
Bowen,‘ but membership in the
Legal Awareness Committee is
open to anyone interested.
Bowen said Pitt is uniques in that
the ‘judicial system is entirely
‘student run.

Strike Agreement

Near After
5 Weeks

by MATTHEW KAMBIC
Although Teamsters Local 211 is
nearing agreement with the Pitts-
burgh Press Co., other newspaper
related unions with expiring
contracts threaten to lengthen the

strike which has left -Pittsburgh.

without maior papers for ﬁve
weeks.

A vote on the new contract
negotiated in Texas will reportedly
occur Thursday at a membership
meeting of Local 2l_1. . Pickets
representing _the union have
already been removed from the
Press’ downtown buildings.

‘The International Typographical’

Union Local 7 is among the unions -' 
who are up for new contracts with  9

the Press. According to radio
reports, a source at the Post
Gazette, said “They may be willing

to come back to work, they may i

not. These issues are being
discussed right now.

“We are hopeful the papers will
be published as soon as possible.
The earliest possible publication-
would be Monday, May 13. But
nothing more will be known until
Thursday.”

According to the reports, con-'
tract problems are arising over the
increase in automation and its
obvious danger to employment.
“Obviously if the perfected ma-
chinery can do the iob at less cost

and with equal or greater efﬁ-C

ciency, it is a threat to workers.
What employees are looking for, as

evidenced by similar situationsl

around the country, is a guaranteed

ﬁgure; if 500 were employed in'‘'’''

1968; they want to be sure 500 will

The reports said people there
were being maintained on the
payroll in order to have a staff
ready should the strike end.

New Clue In Watergate

(Continued from Page 1)
relations consultant to the Hughes
enterprises in 1969-70 between
stints as party chairman.”

It was then John Dean, the
special White House counsel,
learned that O’Brian had been
hired by Maheu, and that the two
were “long-time friends.” This
revelation led White House aides to
believe Maheu may have informed
O’Brian about the illegal anti trust
action and the gifts to Rebozo.

O’Brian said, according to the_

report, that he has no knowledge of
the deal. ’
“Investigators for the Senate

‘Watergate Committee now be-
lieve,” the report continues, “that '

the case supplies the missing
motive behind the 1972 burglary of
Democratic’, headquarters, which
led to most of the Mr. Nixon's
impeachment problems. They
contend--but Mr. Mitchell denies--
that the Attorney General tam-

1 pered with the Dunes’ case and

that fear of discovery of the facts
led to the Watergate ;break-in
mission.” '
According to the Senate testi-
mony of Jeb Magruder,‘ a former
Mitchell aide in the Committee to
Re-elect the President, Mr. Mit-
chell either selected or approved

the, selection of two targets for
surveillance--Democratic[Chairman
O’Brian and a newspaper publisher
Hank Greenspun. .

It appears, then, insofar as the
Senate Watergate Committee is
concerned, that the drama of the
June 17, 1972 break-in at Demo-
cratic headquarters is at the
beginning of the end. Months and
months of testimony, as researched
and poured over by the Commit-
tee's staff, as well as timely
revelations such as the White
House conversations is beginning
to tell the whole tale of Watergate.

Only a few important questions
about the break-in remain. Was
President Nixon involved in anypof
the planning for the anti-trust
settlements favorable to Howard
Hughes in return for the cash
contributions delivered to his
friends Bebe Rebozo, and the
break-in at Watergate which

‘allegedly resulted?

And how long will. it be before
the central Watergate conspirators
such as John N. Mitchell as they
begin to feel the heat
investigations, decide to plea
“bargain before it is too late. It
would be too late if the President
were impeached by the House and
convicted in the Senate.

Steel Contract Sparks
WAM Protest Rally

BY GENE GRABOWSKI

Protesting what they called one
of the-most blatant sellouts in labor
history, about 75 members of the
Workers Action Movement (WAM)
rallied in Pittsburgh on Friday as
part of a national May Day
demonstration tour across Amer-
ica.

WAM spokesman claimed that
the recently signed no-strike
contract between the steelworkers’
union and the country’s ten biggest
steel companies was negotiated
without the consent of the rank and
file steelworkers.

-The group demonstrated outside
of the Pittsburgh Hilton Hotel,
where representatives of the
country’s steelworkers’ union
stayed during contract ‘talks.

The demonstrators carried bright
red ﬂags and marched-in a tight
circle on the hotel’s plaza chanting
“Thirty hours work, forty hours
pay.”

When union representatives
came down to the plaza to watch
the demonstration, the scene was
transformed into a shouting match
between WAM members and the
representatives. '

Taunted with shouts of “Get a
job,” a WAM member told the
ofﬁcialsz “Someday the workers
will have your jobs,-and then you’ll
have to go to the coke ovens.”

Most of the onlookers inter-
viewed during the demonstration
didn't believe the group had a
legitimate reason to protest. Said
one bystander, “The steelworkers
got the best deal they’l1 ever get.”
Another added, “Who are these
people representing? Certainly not

the steelworkers. They're happy
with the agreement; you don't see
them here do you?”

Pittsburgh resident John Amor-»

elli acted as spokesman for WAM
explaining that the representatives
who meet with the big bosses of
steel companies are isolated from
the rank and file workers. “The
representatives are working for the
companies. They’ve been bought
off," he said. “We want the
workers to regain their solidarity,
but this contract takes it away.”

The contract in question is a
three-year agreement that bars
strikes by the steelworkers’ union
until 1980 in return for a
guaranteed cost of living increase
in workers’, paychecks based on the
rising consumer price index.
WAM claims the increase is not
enough because it doesn’t over-
come inﬂation, and workers are
deprived of their only real»
weapon--the right to strike.

After the demonstration at the
Hilton Hotel, the group went to the
Clairton works of the US Steel
Corporation and gathered outside
of the factory gates hoping to drum
up support among the steelworkers
themselves. «

Although the demonstration had
been advertised on ﬂyers for more

than a week in advance, most '

steelworkers avoided the group.
On Saturday, the group moved
on to Washington DC for a May

,Day rally, demanding thirty hours

work for forty hours pay, and an

end to racism in_ the nation’s

factories and schools.

Chancellor Brandt Resigns C¢,rm;CheC,|:

Amid Espionage Scandal

BONN, West Germany AP--
Willy Brandt, plagued by a series
of provincial election setbacks and
a damaging spy scandal, submitted
his resignation late Monday night
as chancellor of West Germany.

In an official announcement, the

— federal press office said Brandt

asked President Gustav . Heine-
matm in a letter to name Vice
Chancellor Walter Scheel as head
of a caretaker government until
parliament can choose a new
chancellor.

A presidentail spokesman said
Heinemann, who received Brandt’s
letter during a visit to Hamburg,
declared his acceptance of the
resignation. _

Scheel also is foreign minister‘
and leader of the -Free Democrats,
principal partner in the coalition
government with Brandt’s Social
Democrats. He called off a planned
Tuesday trip to Brussels.

Brandt’s dramatic move followed
behind-the-scenes negotiations all
day Monday among Brandt, his
coalition partners and the opposi-
tion parties, informants said.

Brandt’s popularity has begun to
wane from its high point in 1971

7 when he won the Nobel Peace Prize
. for his Ostpolitik, or efforts at

accommodation with the Com-
munist Eastern bloc.

Lately, an increasing number of
West Germans have viewed Ost-
politik with displeasure. The spy
scandal involving Guenter Guil-
laume, an aide to the chancellor,
emphasized the situation.

In recent_ months, Brandt’s
Social Democrats already had
suffered a series of state election
setbacks. In March they lost their

‘ majority in the important Hamburg

city-state legislature.

The spy case, described by an
opposition legislator as West
Germany’s worst in a long series of
post-World War II spy affairs,
broke April 24 when Guillaume was
arrested and charged with spying
for the East Germans.

Although Brandt denied before
parliament that Guillaume had
access to any state secrets, Interior
Minister Hans-Dietrick Genscher

at the time acknowledged that it

was “a case of particularly grave
and particularly dangerous es-

‘pionage. ’ ’

After Guillaume was arrested
West German newspapers carried
many stories--though not con-
firmed ofﬁcially--that Guillaume
had been’ regularly feeding infor-
mation to East Berlin and- that at
the time of his arrest he was
preparing to ﬂee the country.

Former Black Panther activist
Stokely Carmichael brought his
political ideology to Pitt Thursday,
calling for an end to black
Americanism and outlining his
plans for revolution.

Speaking to a crowd in the
Student Union Ballroom, Car-

organ, the All African Peoples

uniting all blacks everywhere and
uniting Africa as a continental
republic under “scientific social-'
ism.”

Council Without Ears

: " When the Senate Council voted overwhelmingly to end discussion of
the status of childcare programs at Pitt, the members indicated not
only their lack of concern for childcare programs, especially the
Arsenal Family and Cl1ildren’s Center, but also their unwillingness to
P be open to the questions and complaints of students.

' Student Government Board member Bruce Keeler directed the

I meniier of the cinrent Student Government Board had listed anything

onthe agenda for discussion by the members ofthe Council.

I Dr. Edward Blake of the Business School moved the discussion be
A closed to discuss the supposedly more importantsubject of faculty
- salaries, which already had been the subject of nearly two hours of the

C meeting. Blake stated it was his impression that the purpose of Senate
'5 Council meetings for students was the scheduling of meetings with Pitt

I administrators. '

The Senate Council composed of administrators, faculty, and student
representatives should focus its attention on the interest of all three
— groups, and not just the concerns of the faculty representatives.
 Additionally, Arsenal Center is not solely a concern of the students.

The Senate Council has an obligation to hear the complaints of

J students as presented by their elected representatives. Once students

are denied functional participation in the proper processes of the

'— University, they can only seek resolutions to problems outside the

mainstream of the University system, which is a potentially dangerous

proposition. _

Five and One-Half  

; The edited White House transcripts of conversations released to the
. American people and the House Judiciary Committee last week have
unmasked President Nixon not surprisingly as a cynical, scheming and
paranoid individual, whose attempt to reserve his niche in American
, history overshadowed his duty to the public. A
A After one Watergate bombshell after another, the first nearly two
years ago with the breakin at Democratic Headquarters in Washington,
it should be clear that the President was not solely responsible when he
released the transcripts for exposing the frightening realities of the
Watergate drama. Many realities are already the public’s knowledge.

John W. Dean, 3rd testiﬁed that the President was involved in the
cover-up of illegal activities. Alexander Butterﬁeld revealed the
_ existence of a system within the White House whereby private
' Presidential conversations were recorded. Then some of those tapes,
. , subpoened by Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox were not delivered and
the authority to request such material was clnillenged in the courts.
Afterrulingsinthecourtsimfavorablz“ to the administration, Cox was
1 ﬁred and the Satzurday Night l\/liass.ra:re became history.

Once the tapes were delivered it was discovered others did not exist.
Another was found to have 18‘/2 minutes missing and unaccounted for.

Seven former aides to the President, including his top associates
I-LR. Haldeman and John Erlichman, were indicted by the Watergate
grand jury for their alleged criminal behavior in the coverup. Some
Nixon representatives, such as Donald Segretti, Herbert Porter, and
Egil Krogh have pleaded guilty to Watergate crimes.

Nor was  President responsible last week for revealing his true
ambitions and personality to the people of the land.

In 1968 Richard Nixon was elected to the Presidency claiming he had
a secret plan to end the war in Vietnam. He did not release it after his
'. election, nor did he release it when the war ended in 1973.

He used the POW-MIA issue to increase his standing in the public
opinion polls and justify East Asian policy. He ordered the unmerciful
» bombing and mining of North Vietnem harbors and destroyed a nation
already ravaged by a war, which had as its only purpose at that point to
allow the disengagement of American troups in a way to bring honor to
an embattled home front.

’ Furthermore, he abandoned his own welfare legislation because a

The plight of the underpriviledged was no concern.

Labels such as “peace with honor,” southern strategy, and the silent

by hiding reality and creating a public image administration.

Hard look

 

To A ccept A New Ghallenge

BY BRUCE KEELER

College is a place that is
supposed to challenge its students
and dare young people to look at
themselves and the world around
them. It is an institution dedicated
to the betterment of both the
individual and the community.

On June 30, the University will
lessen these challenges and simul-

taneously reveal that this philo-P

sophy of education is faltering. On
that date the University will close
an educational resource it has
sponsored for over twenty years,
the Arsenal Family and Children’s
Center.

With the closing of the Arsenal
Family and Children’s Center, the
University will be abandoning one
of its most successful research and
training centers. The Arsenal
serves as both a training center for
students in fields ranging from
child development to social work,
education, an theology and as a
research gathering resource on
child development.

At the same time, the Center
provides the
community with one of Allegheny
County’s most progressive educa-
tion centers for children-an impor-
tant part of the University
philosophy of not only beneﬁting
students but beneﬁting the com-
munity around the University.

For the past three years Arsenal
has been in limbo .as its own
department in the College of Arts
and Sciences. The administration
points to this fact and to the fact
that none of the schools of the
University which use Arsenal are
willing to accept it as one of their
programs.

WPGH

Dear Editor:

I was appalled at the spread
devoted to “WPGH Plans FM
Expansion” by one Al Matecko in
your April 8 issue. I'm. willing to
hear arguments for this and
proposals for that if and only if the
proponent will give concrete facts
as support. Mr. Matecko’s
promises of benefits from an. FM
WPGH are about as concrete as

snowmen on the Fourth of July. -.

What really disappointed me was
the fact that the Pitt News gave
some status to the article by not
printing it as one of the usual
“letters to the editor.” As far as
1’m_ C0IlC.6I‘I1ed. Mr. Matecko’s
article was one of the poorest
pieces of journalism I've ever seen.
Allow me to explain.

'Lawrenceville :

Unfortunately, what the adminis
tration fails to point out is that they
refuse to’ increase the budgets of
any of the schools to cover this
program. Because of this fact,
none of the schools can afford to
take Arsenal under their wing
without cutting programs which
they already sponsor.

Arsenal Center is not the only
outstanding community service and
educational center from which the
University wants to withdraw its
support. .The four year
Citizenship Information Center is
also on its way out.

The pattern the administration
uses to give the axe to such
programs is clearly emerging.
First, the director of the program is
told that because of budget
cutbacks, outside sources of
support such as private grants will
have to be found for the program to
continue. These grants, in turn,
‘become the predominant source of
funds for the program.

When these grants to finance the

old ‘

program are found the administra-
tion cuts the University portion by
an amount equal to the grant.
When the private money l'l.lIlS out
the administration says the pro-
gram will have to be eliminated
since money for it “just isn’t in the
budget.”

These cutbacks in education by
the administration have presented
students with new challenges.
Now the challenge is to either
accept the narrowed philosophy of
the University and work within the
smaller framework of education or
to ﬁght the administration .to
continue these progressive pro-
grams which enhance academic life
and promote involvement.

The challenge now before
students is to take a hard look at
the administration’s educational
philosophy and question it. This is
one challenge the administration
hopes the students will not accept.

Student Government Board[

Mr. Matecko says that “the cost
factors might seem extravagant,”
but does he” tell us what the
estimated cost is? He then_tells us
that “the wider range is a ‘great
necessity to a university such as
Pitt,” and that “a strong signal of
several miles radius from‘ the
Cathedral will be received by a
majority of students.” Now, Al,
maybe you're unfamiliar with the
meaning of “several,” but Web-
ster defines it as more than two but
less than many. I seriously doubt
that the “majority of students” live
several miles from campus. And
seeing that they don’t, I don’t think
such a project is “‘a great
necessity.’ ’

I wonder if Mr. Matecko actually
believes that most dorm students
listen to WPGH, or will, even if it
goes FM. I am not detracting from
the students that work. at the
station; as a matter of fact, I

To The Edﬁor

commend tham for seeking training

‘expect me to listen to a newsman

the impression, that he’s on
something. Ifll keep to my WDVE
and WYDD thank you. And to
think that Mr. Matecko states that
this “helps the university create a
favorable and hopefully impressive
effect on the general population of
Pittsburgh.” ' '

I think the student populace is
being had. Student spokesmen
have been pointing the finger at the
administration too many times for
us to notice anymore that the most
vile deeds are perpetrated from the
inside.’ Right, Al?

Library

Dear Editor:

Hillman Library has a new
gimmick for making money - a
computer. Is the “infallible”
computer a friend to mankind or a
ﬁendish enemy?

It seems that Hillman Library’s
computer has taken a great dislike
to folds - in computer cards, that is.
Don’t be surprised if, when you’re
checking our books, the librarian
informs you that you have a book
which is four or more weeks
overdue. It happened to me three
times. I innocently imagined
several books lying on my shelf
gathering dust. The first time it
happened to me, I rushed back to
my room and searched for the
book, but, of course, to no avail.
Returning to the library, I asked for

Dear Editor,
We are presently witnessing the

   

demoralization of- American So-
ciety. Everywhere you look,
corruption and ﬁlth abound in
either a physical or mental state.
The elevators in the Litchﬁeld
Towers are a prime example of the
dementedness of our society.
Every day when I step into an
elevator, Ifeel as if I'm encased in
lewdness. If there isn't a poor
facsimile of a genital staring me in
the eye, then a profound slogan is.
I have occupiedsa room in Tower A
for all four _years of my under-
graduate career and have been a

captive of this incredible collection

of profanity all too long.

Those Towers residents who
have violated housing regulations
by bringing pets (primarily dogs)
have let their animals excrete feces
in the halls. In fact, I have even
seen human feces and urine lay
stagnant in the elevators. And
these are the so called “educated"
members of our society and future
“leaders."

If these people are the “educat-
ed" ones, then how do the

‘ uneducated act?

I cannot remember.

Gulag Archipelago [1918-1956], I
and II
by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn
= Russian Language Edition
YMCA-Press, Paris, 1973.
I The subtitle of the book
“Experiment in creative investiga-
tion” describes it most accurately:
»- not ﬁction, but rather a searching
 inquiry by a creative artist, indeed
‘ ya great master.

 

merely for its aesthetic values,
 although it bears all the hallmarks
‘ of Solzhenitsyn’s style: as usual,
X ‘he writes a powerful prose, alive to
I the spoken word and all his favorite
 devices are present--the play with
 f preﬁxes, archaic and vernacular
S. expressions, camp slang, the
'3. l-melodious quality of folksongs
coupled with the biting terseness of
 proverbs. One should read Gulag
I _Archipelago to glimpse the great
tragedy of Russia (otherwise known

_ "lies that still separates the East
from the West. Although “other

 do not necessarily learn from other
jg » people’s mistakes," the book
 should serve as a warning to the
West.

Gulag Archipelago, meaning the
Soviet labor camp system, is a
symbol of the vast camp network
 covering the whole country and
' especially the Far North. The
 publication at this time of the first

script and who had revealed its
whereabouts under pressure.

In Gulagx Solzhenitsyn success-
fully demolishes a few myths of
long standing. Some of the more
stubborn ones: that th '1bor camp

system was introduced only L,

)’N

. Stalin; that there was only one big

wave of arrests--in 1937-38; and
that Lenin was a humane, benign,
father-like ﬁgure. -
Solzhenitsyn is of course quite
right to point out that there were at
least three great periods of terror:
1929-30 in connection with the
forcible collectivization, the best
known one of 1937-38 and the
1944-46 mass persecution of former
POW’s and laborers, returning (or
being returned) from the West.
In order to explain the relative
anonymity of the first wave
Solzhenitsyn writes: “The majority
of persons in this torrent were plain

folks and did not write memoirs,"
while the 1937-8 period included
mostly representatives of the
intelligentsia. Solzhenitsyn also
argues cogently that the notion that
t"e 1920's were a free and liberal
 is absurd.

The author is perfectly aware of
the difficulty of the task of
determining with precision the very
beginnings of the mass persecu-
tions. He is, however, able to
quote from an article of Lenin’s
(1918), focusing on the single
common aim to “purify the Russian
land of all sorts of insects.” Under
“insects” Iienin understood not
only all the alien classes (although
he himself belonged by birth and
upbringing to one of them), but
many others, including workers
“who shun work...” In fact the
class of “insects" proved vast and
varied in Lenin's.time and later and
included a lot of intellectuals.

In this context Solzhenitsyn cites
from Lenin's -letter to Gorky
(September 15, 1919), passing
iudgement on the maiority of the
intelligentsia in the following way:
“Asia matter of fact this is not the
brain of the nation, but shit.”
More evidence: Lenin’s comments
(to the Head of the Justice
Department) on executions:
“Comrade Kurskii! In my opinion
the application ofexecutions
should be expanded..." and his
subsequent “iustiﬁcation of ter-
ror.” ’

Robert Conquest (Saturday. Re-
vie1World April 20, 1974) summed
it up well: “...So1zhenitsyn does
not put the blame solely on Stalin
and the ‘personality cult.’ He
traces the long evolution of terror,

showing that the labor-camp

. and consummate irony.

system, the frame-up trials, the
mass shootings, thesecret disap-
pearances-—all go back to early
Soviet times.".

Solzhenitsyn provides an excel-
lent psychological explanation for
the relatively weak attempts to
resist arrest, to ﬂee, to fight back,
namely--innocent people do not
resist in the hope that everything
will -be cleared up. Passive
resignation and apathy prevail,
while in the few cases of successful

~evasion the prospective victims

were able to get away with relative
ease.

In his great epic of martyrdom
Solzhenitsyn makes clear that no
nation -was overlooked, there was

no discrimination as far as»

persecution was concerned. Of
great interest is Solzhenitsyn’s
version of Stalin’s scenario for a

Jewish pogrom in connection with-

the notorious doctor plot: the
doctors were to be hanged in Red
Square; this would entice patriots
(naturally, under the guidance of
trained instructors) to a “spontan-
eous" outbreak against all Jews
and this in turn would provide
Stalin with the opportunity to play
the benefactor by exiling the Jews
to Siberia and the Far East where
the barracks were already put in
readiness for them.

The cynicism of the Red leaders
(and not only Stalin’s), the rule of
a party, consisting, of men totally
devoid of any moral scruples and
any sense of responsibility, the
most sordid schemes of the
so-called “great” leaders--all are
exposed by Solzhenitsyn with skill
1 As for
Stalin himself--the monster ap-
pears full-size as a thoroughly

unprincipled Eastern despot who

. betrayed his friends with the same

ease he ruthlessly hounded down
his “enemies.”

According to Solzhenitsyn at the
height of the mass terror cam-
paigns the numbers of prospective
victims were set by a central
planning agency and commun-
icated to the lower echelons as
target ﬁgures to be completed on
fixed dates.

After the revolution the very
concept of “guilt” was abolished
and in the beginning of the 1930's
the whole idea was declared
“rightist opportunism . ’ ’ Solzhen-
itsyn’s opinion of Communists is
rather low because of their
behavior in the 30’s: “Perhaps the
year ’37 was necessary to demon-
strate of what little value is that
whole “ideology" with which they
strutted around so cheerfully,
turning Russia upside down,
smashing her strongholds, tramp-
ling her holy of holies--that Russia
where such reprisals never threat-
ened them.” ‘

Systematically, often recon-
structing events from eyewitness
accounts, Solzhenitsyn proceeds to
analyze each of the great terror

-waves, as well as the lesser shocks

from the very beginning, from
1917-18 up to the middle ﬁfties. (It
is of course obvious that successive
parts of the books will be devoted
to more recent times). Solzhen-
itsyn also goes systematically
through all the paragraphs of the
notorious ‘ ‘counter-revolutionary’ ’
article 58 of the Penal Code,
invoked in the majority of the
“political” cases since its inception
in 1926.

his legitimate surprise that this-

- been so far successfully kept secret

by the British and American
governments, while itis virtually
impossible to keep political secrets
in the West for any length of time.
His interest in this affair was no
doubt stimulated by numerous
encounters in prison camps with
representatives of this group.
Solzhenitsyn mentions approvingly
an article by Julius Epstein’ on this
subject in the Sunday Oklahoman
[Jan. 21, 1973]; in fact he thanks
the author in the name of those who
have perished and the few
survivors.

. A good‘ example of limitless
Western gullability is the highly
instructive case of one Eric Arvid

millionaire with Socialist leanings.
He visited Moscow as the member
of a Swedish military delegation,
was given the usual. vodka-caviar»
ballerina treatment and on his
return praised Socialism and its
homeland to the skies.
This proved his undoing:

Anderson, stationed in West
Berlin, was spirited away from East

Berlin where he had a girl friend. A

In Moscow he was requested to
renounce his father and capitalism,
but refused to collaborate. After all
attempts to re-educate him (mainly
by means of supplying him with the
works of Marx-Enge1s-Lenin-Stal-
in) failed, he was sentenced to 20
years of labor camp. Here he
naturally became a staunch sup-
porter of the West and its rotten
ways. (Not a bad idea to have all

BY BRUCE IRVING

The life of Cat Stevens would
make a great movie. The
highlights of The Cat Stevens Story
would go something like this: the
young British-born son of poor
Greek immigrants finds his way
into the music industry. his
uncanny ability to write and sing

‘hit-formula songs sparks a

metereoric rise to pop stardom,
with numerous hit singles released

in England in the middle sixties.

At the peak of this career he is
stricken by a near-fatal illness
(possible polio). He emerges from
his two year fight for life with a
firm resolve to abandon the
“plastic path of pure pop" and
make music that is a true reflection
his own soul, without regard for its

acceptability in the pop scene.

Mona Bone Jakon was the first
album from the “new Cat Stevens.
The critical response to it was
luke-warm and the buying public
was practically indifferent. Ste-
vens dug in for what he thought

would be a’ long haul, recording.

and releasing Tea for the Tillerman
in mid-1970.

The album was an- immediate
the eleven songs it
contained were lyrically perceptive
and imaginative and the musical
framework he built around them
was precise and delicate. The
single “Wild World” and the
album itself were quickly certified
gold by the record industry. Much
to his surprise, Stevens had
acheived new musical success on
his own terms in only his second
attempt.

My proposed movie could

‘perhaps end on this cheerful not;

but alas, Cat Stevens remains in

real life. Having proved his ability
to please both himself and the
masses, he began to experiment
with his music, incorporating more
diverse interests and inﬂuences.

Unusual rhythms, rockier arrange-
ments and the Greek bouzoukia
helped make Teaser and the
Firecat a successful album, and the
several gems it contained (“Moon-
shadow,"“Morning has broken")
more than made up for the slight

decrease in lyrical imaginativeness w

it displayed.

 

The next two Stevens efforts,
Catch Bull at Four and Foreigner,

were characterized by further
experimentation, but were not very
satisfying albums. A new,
full-time band, more elaborate
string and horn arrangements, and
imaginative use of electronic
synthesizers brought new sounds
to these records, but Stevens
wasn’t saying much of anything
new, musically or lyrically.

He seemed to be searching for
something, some new force that
could guide his music into new
areas, but seemed frustrated in this
search. The paradoxes of pop

stardom seemed to have caught up
with him once again,

and he

 

expressed his dilemma in th

e
opening lines of “Foreigner
Suitez" “There are no words I can

use, because the meanings till left
for you to to choose..."

Buddha and the Chocolate Box,
his latest release, finds Cat
Stevens still searching, not
knowing quite what to say or how to
say it. It is his sixth album and as
such is strong in its technical
aspects; production and musician-
ship are impeccable throughout.
Synthesizers and strings are used
creatively and background vocals
are particularly delightful on
several songs.

The songs themselves are dis-
appointing, though. Melodically,
there is a strong feeling of deja vu;
Stevens frequently seems to be
imitating himself. The same
problem exists lyrically; these are
themes he has dealt with better in
the past.

He relies too heavily on cliche
statements on such subjects as

music [“...can brighten the
world”), nature [“Sun is the
reason and the world it will

bloom”] and human foibles [“Oh
don’t say those same idol lies”].
The exotic fantasy worlds, life-like
characters and vivid imagery of
past songs are for the most part
absent.

The high point of the album is the
single release “Oh Very Young,” a
lovely, melodic song with lyrics
reminiscent of “Father and Son."
It is played and sung without
gimmickry and quietly takes its
place among Stevens’ best songs,
suggesting that while he may be
drifting at the moment, his talent
has not been lost. I expect to hear a
lot of good music from Cat -Stevens.

A truck carrying dangerous
chemicals iacknifes on the highway
near a small town in Arizona. The
poisonous fumes spread all over
the town, killing all the inhabitants
except for ten people who are
mysteriously immune to the poi-
son. However, the food supply will
permit only four of them to survive.
The Studio Theatre production of
“l0”,written and directed by J. A.
Silverman forces the audience to
choose which four people will live,
creating a sticky ethical problem.
Each actor participant stands up
in front of the audience and
presents his case, explaining why
he should live and why he wants to
live. There is a brief question-and
-answer period which gives the
actors an opportunity to improvise.
Then the audience goes on its
power trip and checks off four
names on the ballot. In attempting
to solve this insoluble problem, the
audience inevitable comes up
against their own biases and
potential cruelty.
With not scenery or props and

and the validity of their arguments.

the roughness of some of the
performances can easily be traced
to a lack of experience. These
people are just starting out, and

them. At moments, they capture
essential feelings--anger, .fear--
with little artifice or self-conscious-
ness.

Some interesting things happen
during the course of the evening.
Friction arises between several of
the characters and it becomes
evident that the steelworker and
the iunkie, or the prostitute and the
housewife could never co-exist
peacefully together. Frustrations
and violent emotions are un-
leashed. Alliances form between
several people and it becomes a
microcosm of society as it is.

Creator/ Director Silverman’s
concept is an interesting one. _
“10” is moving away from
mainstream theatre into the realm
of psychodrama mixed with a
Brechtian demand_ for moral
commitment on the part of the
audience. It opens new possibili-
ties for the theatrical experience.

There were moments when the
whole thing just barely hung
together, as if it lacked a central
focus, but as a whole, it works. The
lines are intelligent, well-thought-
out and well-written. With works
like this,. the Studio Theatre is
fulﬁlling an important function. It
becomes a place where people who
might not ordinarily get a chance to
perform can gain valuable exper-

\ience and where original student-

written scripts can beproduced;

Louisville, Kentucky--If the Churchill Downs board of ofﬁcials were
disgusted with the behavior of the crowd last weekend at the 100th
running of the Kentucky Derby, they can only blame themselves for
what happened. . . .

After ax small mob descended on Cannonade after .,the ﬁnish, beer
bottles were thrown-at one horse at the paddock, several spectators
followed the horses down the stretch .and the ninth.and tenth races
were almost cancelled because the track couldn’t be cleared, only the
Down ofﬁcials are at fault for merely letting so many through the gates
in the first place. '

Over 160,000 people turned out'for the historic event, despite the
poor ﬁeld of Derbe candidates and even though the track set records in
attendance. and money bet on the race, the 100th Run For The Roses
was marred by the actions of'a few dozen nuts that found themselves
completelyovertaken by the carnival atmosphere. .

On Friday night, the town of Louisville was a temporary camp for
thousands who arrived without hotel reservations or inadequate funds
to meet the specially raised prices of even the cheapest of motels.

Over 100,000 occupied the inﬁeld area all day Saturday, drinking
breakfasts of beer and mint _iuleps and then baking themselves crimson
in the searing Kentucky sun. The infield was an ocean of bodies,
milling back and forth like penned cattle. By mid-afternoon, people
dropped like ﬂies of heat prostration, streakers climbed the inﬁeld
ﬂagpole and swung by the rope, and the police in the crowd traveled
only in large groups, passing the day be betting on the races.

When it was ﬁnally time for the Derby [4'pm Kentucky time] most of
the people in the inﬁeld were either totally inebriated and/ or laid back
from exhaustion. There were few incidents in the crowd mainly
because the’ national guard and police were smart enough to mind their
own business.

The stream of people to the inﬁeld started at eight am Saturday and
continued all afternoon. In other words, Churchill Downs put no. limits
on its inﬁeld capacity. They did not have the food and health facilities
to accomodate the number they allowed in, although most were wise
enough to bring their own food which included chests of beer and
bottles of whiskey, plainly prohibited by rules apparently not enforced.

Now I’m not blaming the infractions of the rules for what happened,
but the number of times the rules were violated. It could have
happened with a smaller crowd, but the odds of it happening would
naturally be smaller.

The Preakness and the Belmont, the other legs‘ of the Triple Crown,
run at Pimlico in Baltimore and Belmont, N.Y. respectively, have limits
on ticket sales. Churchill Downs desperately needs to draw the line on
the attendance figures on Derby Day.

The fact that it was the 100th running of the Kentucky Derby was
enough to draw the numbers despite a poor ﬁeld. Now the Derby will
enjoy increased attendance every year for the next several years
because of the record number of people who had never been to the
event before and’ will be willing to make it an annual affair.

Just think of the crowd Secretariat would have drawn last year if the
Derby wasn’t the first leg of the Triple Crown.

day’s races.

Despite Cannonade’s Derby win,
there is still some doubt as to
whether or not it was the best horse
in the ﬁeld. With a little bit of luck,
any of the other 22 entries could
have come home a winner. But all
the luck was with Cannonade and
Cordero, and at the conclusion of
the race many of the jockeys
expressed relief at just having
come back alive. 0

One horse, Flip Sal, a winner of a
division of the Wood Memorial,
was not so fortunate and may not
come back at all. The horse
suffered a double fracture of the
seismoid bone of the left front
ankle and is presently ﬁghting for
its life at the track hospital.

Cannonade will now be made
ready for the Preakness which w-ill
be held at Pimlico on May 18th.

T Becominga physician is atremendous
satisfaction.

   
 

while but that is entirely beside the
point. Philly's inability to
completely annihilate a lackluster
Ranger squad that was one of the
worst New York has produced in
the last few years was rather
blatant and will carry a bearing in
the ﬁnals.

The Rangers were kept in the
game only by the outstanding
goaltending of Eddie Giacomin,
while the defense at the New York
blue line sagged ineptly. The
Rangers looked like a conglomera-
tion of rookies, unable to headman
the puck due to poor -passing and
inadequate skating ability.

The Flyers merely played their
game, pounding the Rangers on
every possible occasion and then
watching them skate like whipped
dogs. As New York coach-general
manager Emile Francis said prior

to the sixth game of the semiﬁnal ”

series as the Rangers faced
elimination, “Its a matter of
determination. 'We’ve practicing
the fundamentals and the skating
all year long, most of our guys for
the last 10 or 12 years.”

And the determination of the
Rangers was quite apparent.

The New Yorkpositional play
was not bad at all, but it was not
the aggressive, smart type that will
win the Sanley Cup. The Rangers
were unable to adjust, unable to
roam in position with the puck.
They were slow covering up for
each other in both ends while the
Flyers were stomping all over th
rink like gangbusters. ' -

Once the Flyers threw their
attack into high gear,‘ having
sensed the Rangers were merely
standing in their skates, waiting for

were unstoppable. Backed up with
more than adequate goaltending
from Bernie Parent, who was
making saves without even know-
ing it, the Philly defense was able
to turn away a New York attack that

sporadic .bursts.

Philly did a good
intimidating New York (the Dave
Schultz-Dale Rolfe ﬁght has to be
one of the most one-sided events
I’ve ever seen) and the injuries
carried by Vic Hadﬁeld and Walt
Tkaczuk didn’t help the Rangers
much either.

You don’t intimidate the Boston
Bruins.

After a'4-0 series sweep over the
Toronto Maple Leafs, the Bruins
were upset in the ﬁrst game of the
semi-finals by the Chicago Black-
hawks, with the 46 saves of goaler
Tony Esposito stopping Boston.
The Bruins did not defeat the
Hawks in _ﬁve regular season
meetings and it looked as if their
domination of the Vezina sharing
defense was over.

Whether you're still in medical school with the
rigors of three to ﬁve years of graduate medical edu-
cation still to be faced, or are already a practicing
physician, it’s our opinion that the Air Force can
offer both professional and personal satisfaction
hard to duplicate in civilian life.

An overstatement? Not if you consider the
speciﬁcs.

Take the problem of graduate medical educa-
tion. It’s a period ofyour life the Air Force can make
considerably easier with comfortable salary and liv-
ing conditions.

Creature comforts aside, the Air Force offers
professional advantages. Besides receiving training
in your own specialty, you'd be in contact with
physicians in all of the medical specialties. You'll
function in an environment which is intellectually
stimulating and professionally challenging.

Not all physicians pursue post residency fellow-
ships. But if you are interested, the Air Force con-
ducts them both in-house and atcivilian institutions.

The physician already in practice can look for-
ward to other things. If you want training in the
practice of the medicine of the future, you'll find it
in the Air Force. For example, there’s emphasis on
group medicine and preventive medicine, and the
growing specialty of “family physician.” Whatever
your interest. there are few specialties which are not
being practiced in today’s Air Force.

The physician starting his practice in civilian

life has to take into account the cost of setting up an -

office. The physician commencing his practice in

go with it.

the Air Force does not. He ﬁnds his ofﬁceestablished
for him. Supplies and equipment readily available.
He has many options available to him when treating
patients. For example, he can consult with Air Force
specialists. He also has referral to other Air Force

facilities via aeromedical evacuation. Last, but not

least, are the satisfactions that come with having
the opportunity for regular follow-ups, and a missed
appointment rate that is practically nil.

Whether you are already a physician, or soon to
become one, you might ﬁnd it extremely interesting
to ﬁnd out what the Air Force has to offer. We think
it could be a real eye-opener. If you'll mail in the cou-
pon. we’d be happy to send you detailed information.

fourth game at home. The series
went back to Boston and the
aroused Bruins literally ‘blew the
Hawks and Tony 0 right out of the
Garden, 6-2. Esposito was
replaced in the third period of that
contest by backup goaler Mike
Veisor.

Once again the series shifted
back to Chicago but it was apparent
it didn’t matter where the Bruins
were playing. The Hawks bowe
out respectably, 4-2. '

Now the Flyers, who can boast a
pair of candidates for the Conn
Smythe Trophy (for the Playoff
MVP) in goaler Bernie Parent and
even more so center I Rick
MacLeish, have but one and only
one game to match against the
Bruins--Philly can’t play a clean
game of hockey and win. They’ll
have’ to come out rough against
Boston merely because it’s all they

goals scored, itmcannot compare to

the Bruins.5 That previous fact is a
prime example of how statistics can
be deceiving.

Boston is not the “one line and
an offensive defenseman” that
every‘ know-nothing: around thinks
they are.‘ The line of Johnny
Bucyk, Greg Sheppard and Bobby
Schmautz has come through for the
Bruins in grand fashion and Phil
Esposito, Ken Hodge and Wayne
Cashman are back at top form.

Bucyk, Sheppard or Esposito
could grab the MVP award if they
keep up their respective paces.

In goal, Gilles Gilbert has been
solid all the ‘way, playing one ‘bad
game against Chicago [the 8-6
Bruin win] and has shown he can
carry the load. Boston will need
steady performances from Dallas
Smith and Carole Vadnais at the
blue line and will get them.

The Rangers could score against
the Flyers mainly when it was the
Flyers who mademistakes in their
own end. The Bruins are -a team
that make their opponents make

mistakes. Parent is no Ken Dryden ‘

and his weakness will show with
the increased number of shots he
will face against the Bruins.

Before all of you avid Flyer fans
tear this paper up and burn it. ﬁrst
realize that I do not condemn them

‘ for the team they are. But as Philly

coach Fred Shero admits, their
style of play is largely patterned
after the most recent organization
to incorporate and emphasize a
physical type "of hockey and do it
successfully--the Boston Bruins.

The Flyers are a team that will
win the Stanley Cup in the near
future but right now lack the
finesse of a Cup champion. They
lack a few key personell and the all
around experience the Bruins have
in vital areas. Philadelphia will
naturally receive it in time.

But not in the next two weeks.

    Pitt  Hosts   

In Temtis Competitiort 

The Pitt tennis team seeks its
ﬁfth victory against two defeats
this afternoon when it hosts
California at 2 pm.

Convincing losses at the hands of
West Virginia and Penn State mar
the netters’ season, which is half
way over. .

Pitt opened the season with a 5-4
victory over Slippery Rock April 8.
The Cats won four of the six singles
matches, then the‘ number one
singles team of Joe Kantor and
Alan Levin won their doubles
match to wrap up the victory.
Kantor was the only Pitt netter to
win both matches.

West-Virginia dealt the Panthers
a crushing 8-1. defeat three days
later, with only the doubles team of
Bill Wood and Mike Hobbel
winning. -

Only a freshman, Hobbel has
impressed Pitt coach Fran Web-

ster. “He’s playing exceptionally
well for a freshman,” said
Webster. ' '

Pitt followed the WV U loss with

« a 7-2 victory over Mansﬁeld State}:
winning five singles matchies» and 

two doubles. '
The top-ranked team in the East,

Penn State, evened Pitt's record. at i.—_i'{._-._~_

2-2, whitewashing the Cats 9-()_.

“Joe Kantor and Mike Hobbel- 4 ;.'f.
gave good accounts of themselves‘ 
and singles, and really everybody 
did well in doubles," said Webster. ’_ 

The Panthers proved their city lV'lf:‘

  
  

 

dominance by dumping Carnegie ‘ 

Mellon 8-1, and Duquesne, 9-0‘ in ,

 

their most recent outings. _  
“The entire squad is coming jl’

around now," Webster said.

“We're hoping to win at least four‘  

of our remaining ﬁve .matches.”_
