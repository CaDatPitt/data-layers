Stram Wins SGB President  

Ken Stram is the unofficial
winner of the Student Govern-
ment Board presidential election
beating Lon Santis last night by a
mere 71 votes.

Stram and Santis ran neck-

and—neck all night long, but
Stram took the lead during the
tabulation of Wednesday’s Tog}!-
ers votes. Stram won with 944
votes and Santis received 873
votes. Gregory Petro, who‘led
several times during the evening,
finished third with 753 votes and
Waleed Al-Atraqchi received
158 votes.

An indication of the close race
between Stram and Santis came
during the tabulation of Thurs-
day’s Towers results — both can-

A didates received 173 votes.

Jeffrey Mallinger was the top-
vote getter for board candidates

with 1,660 votes. Betsy Fitzpa-
trick finished second with 1,446.
Mallinger and Fitzpatrick ran
first and second respectively
throughout the whole night.
Pamela Hart and Robert Kra-
mer shifted back and forth all
night for third place, but Hart
pulled ahead by seven votes over
Kramer at the end. Hart received
1,214 votes and Kramer got
1,207. The top three board posi-
tions are important because they

will be the student representa—.

. tives on the Student Senaten

The other board members are,
in order, John Geyer, a junior
English writing major, with
1,135 votes; Avery Abrams, a
sophomore political science and
speech major, with 1,026; David
Pikovsky, a junior, with 981

votes; and James Haug Jr. with
767 votes.

Stram, who is a member ofthe
current board, said he was very
happy to win the election but
could not comment until after he -
called his mother.

His victory over Santis ends- '
the tradition of Delta Tau Delta
fraternity members’ being board
presidents. The past three presi-
dents have been members ofthat
fraternity, - and Santis is a
member of that fraternity also.

The other candidates finished,
in order, Keith Jefferson with
695 votes and Roland Howze
with 606 votes.

The results are considered .. ,
unofficial until the Office of Stu— . 
dent Activities verifies each can- ' "1
didate’s financial report.

Teach-In Attracts
Overflow Audience

By PEGGY ream  
And MARTY WILLIS

Pitt faculty members organized a ‘

teach-in on U.S. military involve-
ment in Lebanon and Grenada last
Wednesday to address what they
termed a situation which has the
potential for catastrophe.

The teach-in, entitled “Crisis in
Lebanon and Grenada,” attracted
over 250 students, and many more
stood in the hallway.

Professors who spoke were Pitt
professor of Hispanic and Latin and
American studies John ‘Beverley,
Pitt Black Studies professor John
Blackett, Pitt political science pro-
fessor Dr. Richard Cottam, Pitt eco-
nomics professor John Houston,
Pitt law professor Jules Lobel, Pitt
history professor Mark McCul-
lough, Pitt sociology professor Jose
Moreno, Carlow College anthropol-
ogy professor Gloria Rudolph, Pitt
physics professor John Townsend,
Pitt history professor Joe White,
and Pitt history professor Robert
Colodny. 1 '

Blackett, a Jamaican, began the
teach-in giving his perspective on the
Reagan administration’s policy
toward Grenada.

. “The big lie to a large extent is, an
attempt by this administration to

._frighten people into accepting their

policy, a polgcy that represents direct
aggression into the internal affairs of

.a very small“ and a very insignificant

nation.” Blackett said. -“The United
States has at least 20 military install-
ations throughout the Caribbean —-
the- notion. of threat seems

far-fetched. ”
 

‘We're blundering into

_ it withoutany compre-

hension. of what we're
doing....’

——Dr. Richard Cottam

 
He explained the situation in

Grenada’s government is more com- '

plex than Americans are aware.

“I do not think, honestly, that the
American government has a chance
in hell of getting out of this morass in
which it has placed itself in the very
near future,” he concluded.

The Towers Lobby is
crowded, noisy and poorly lit.
The Cathedral is darker still and
offers little in the way of comfort.
It’s 9 p.m., and you have two

Pitt students have long com-
plained about extending library
hours to meet their study needs.

Sophomore Patty Pisula is
forced to do a good bit of home-
work in the Towers Lobby
because her roommate would
rather not sleep with the lights
on.,

Jeff Luciana expressed the
feelings of many commuters who
are left without a study place
when Hillman closes at night.

“The situation stinks,” he said.

Several candidates in this
week’s Student Government
elections included the idea of
extended hours in their plat-
forms. Current board member

"Kathy Brown said she has
spoken to students to get their
opinions on extending H-illman’s

The issue of whether the Student

annual Writers’ Conference was left
undecided for another week after the
board voted 3-3 on the matter at
yesterday's meeting. ‘

‘ The‘ Allocations Committee had
recommended to the board that a
request for $2,000 for the conference
be denied. -The tied vote sends the
request back before the board at

. next week’s meeting.-

Voting to accept the recommen-

perceived that it was a convention
...because it is open to anybody.”
“If this were a convention, they
would call it a Writers’ Convention,”
said Brown, who added that 80 per-
cent of the conference’s participants
are undergraduates.

“I think we all knowinour minds

said. “If we let this one group go,

 Teach-In Draws Overflow Crowd

ea

continued from page one

.Cottam, a noted specialist on the
Middle East, reviewed the develop-
ment of the situation in Lebanon,
describing it as a “mess.”

“They [Israel] went in with the
assumption that they could establish
a Phalangist dictatorship which
would ally with them  and as they
got deeper into the country they
began to learn a great deal more
about Lebanon,” Cottam explained.
“They had unleashed forces they
didn’t understand.” The Israelis, he
said, have asked the U.S. to take
over, and we have.

“We do with that situation
[Lebanon] what we always do,” he
said. “We simplify it into two sides, a
good side and a bad side.” The Pha-
lange, he explained, is a group that
owes its name and ideas to Franciso
Franco and the Hitler Youth — and
the U.S. supports the Phalangist
forces.

“We are fantasizing a situation
that is inﬁnitely complex into a sim-
ple East-West picture,” Cottam said.

“We’re blundering into it without
any comprehension of what we're
doing. We’re simplifying it in the

most idiotically simple Cold War‘

terms, and we're going to get our-
selves killed in the process." V

confronted as a community of scho-
lars in the 1960s. We are both the
object of government propaganda
and we are the potential victims,”
Colodny said.

“I am utterly convinced that the
operation in Lebanon and the oper-
ation in Grenada are but the first
acts of a world scenario. For what
purpose do the warships gather off
the coast of Nicaragua?

“It is not enough to listen to these
words,” he told students. “We have
to organize, to turn our insights and
our outrage into effective political

action, no matter what the risks, no .

matter what the dangers.”

Townsend said he was there
because of his concern over the pos-

I sibility of a nuclear war.

“Colleges and universities,”
Townsend said, “have a responsibil-
Ity to find imaginative and realistic
alternatives to the military solution.

“Each use of military force runs _

the risk of the final military solution,
nuclear war,” he said.

The teach-in lasted two hours and
because of its success, Pitt faculty
has suggested the possibility of
another.

- Good Show

\

I would like to say that if we wish to have an
impact on the world as individuals or as a genera-
tion or as a nation, we must understand it.‘

These words were spoken by Pitt history pro-
fessor Robert Colodny, who organized the first
teach-in at Pitt in 1965. Wednesday, Pitt saw
another teach—in — this time on the issues raised
by U.S. military involvement in Grenada and
Lebanon.

Wednesday's event, unlike its predecessor, did
not take place in the Towers basement or last
until the early hours of the morning, but its pur-
pose and intensity were the same.

Over 250 students a and faculty members
crammed themselves into a small Cathedral of
Learning classroom, spilling out into the hall.
Students came to hear professors offer their pers-
pectives and give their somber predictions.

This handful of impassioned professors recog-
nized their responsibility to their students — an
obligation which extends beyond the classroom.
Today, as in 1965, professors are concerned that
their students are facing a world out of control
and without the knowledge to understand it.

Professors who attended are to be commended
for their concern and foresight to act before the
United States blunders into another era of mil-
itary escalation and adventurism.

Colodny read from his summary of the 1965
teach-in, and the words are still uncomfortably
relevant.

“We have not gathered together to present little
bits of painfully garnered expertise to lay at the
feet of McGeorge Bundy or Lyndon Johnson
[George Schultz and Ronald Reagan]; that is not
the point of these teach-ins. What we wish to do is
convince our students that we have their future at
heart....We shall not deliver them, gagged and
bound, to any military industrial complex with-
out some protest.”

What motivated these professors to organize
this teach‘-in is of concern to all students, so that
they do not walk blindly into a situation. And the_
student has an obligation, too — to learn from
those professors who have been through this
before and to stop being a silent majority.

“There are 240 million Americans and only
100,000 elites,” Colodny said. “If we just got our

V act together, we could take them on.”

Letters To The Editor

Open Letter To SGB President

(Editors note: The following is an
open letter to Student_Government
president Mark Downs.)

Dear Mr. Downs: I

After reading Ms. Diane Lefko-
witz’s article in Ute Pitt News
entitled “SGB To Petition Against
Grenada, Lebanon Crises," on Fri-
day, Oct. 28, 1983, I found myself in
‘complete disagreement with Mr.
Jeff Delmontagne’s petition calling
for the “complete and immediate”
withdrawal of United States troops
from Lebanon and Grenada. Before
any such action is taken to adopt a
policy on this issue, I sincerely
believe that a representative survey
should be taken of the entire student
body. It is my contention that there
is not an overwhelming number of
students that would side with Mr.
Delmontagne’s opinion.

As I am sure you understand, any
decision of the board in this area
should reflect the attitude and opin-
ion of the entire student body. When
I refer to a survey, I am referring to a
truly statistical measurement of the
attitude and opinion of the student
body. It had been an unofficial pol-
icy of past administrations to circu-
late a petition to a number of one’s
friends, and that in turn becomes the
opinion of the board and the entire
student body of the University of
Pittsburgh. Please, let us learn from

our mistakes and not allow this to
happen again. '

It is my belief, as well as many
others’, that our troops should con-
tinue operations in both Grenada
and Lebanon until both countries
are stabilized. I am not naive to the
political aspects involved in the raid
on Grenada, such as taking atten-
tion away from Beirut and showing
the American people and the world
that our armed forces will be used if
necessary, are flexible and can win.

It seems to me that Grenada can
be stabilized rather quickly and our
operations — there will be limited.
Lebanon, however, is quite a differ-
ent matter. The Middle East has
been plagued with religious wars
and turmoil for ages. The current
Lebanese government has been try-
ing to gain a coalition with the many
factions within the nation. Its mil-
itary forces have also grown to a
point where they can better police
themsleves. Without the continued
support of the multinational force,
the Lebanese government would be
forced to yield to Syria, the PLO and
the U.S.S.R. Such a force so close to
Israel would greatly increase the
chances of an escalation to a world
war in the Middle East. The situa-
tion in Lebanon is of vital interest to
the United States and its allies.

The U.S. should have fortified the
point where our 230 were killed with

concrete barriers instead of just hav-
ing barbed wire, etc. I do not know
exactly why this was not done or
why there was not more security;
however, I would assume that such
an attack was not perceived.

Grenada did take some of the
attention away from Lebanon.
Lebanon’s government and armed
forces might reach a point where
they can fend for themselves. If this
should happen, then our forces
could be withdrawn and the adven-
ture would be a success. I sincerely
hope this will be the case in the
future.

In any event, the integrity of the
United States is at stake. We would
be extremely unwise to withdraw.
While I do not support a direct role
of our troops in Lebanon, I do sup-
port the role we are currently taking.
I also support actions which would

, more rapidly strengthen and unify

the Lebanese government.

I by no means claim to be any
authority in this area, but I do have
some knowledge and an opinion.
Since you are representatives of the
entire student body, I urge you to be
sure that-_you are representing the

. entire student body and not just a

small portion.

I sincerely hope that you will
undertake such a survey before you
take any official action.

Dear Editor:

I am writing in response to the
article in the Oct. 31 issue of The
Pitt News about the so-called
teach-in “explaining” the Grena-
da invasion. It appears to me that
the teach-in was nothing more
than a forum for misinformed
radicals denouncing the United
States.

To begin with, Ms. Austin says
her committee was organized
within hours after the invasion.
What gave her and her cohorts
divine knowledge about the cir-
cumstances surrounding the
invasion only hours after it
began when reporters were not
even allowed onthe island until
days later?.Austin then says that
the invasion is “another attack in '

Invasion Defended

a‘ long history of racist enslave-
ment, murder’, and genocide” by
the United States and “long live
the revolution.” If Austin is con-
cerned about genocide, she need
look no further than the hero of
revolution, the Soviet Union. It
is no secret that the Soviet Union
has starved millions of Ukrain--
ians to death in the past and is ’
today butchering thousands in
Afghanistan as well as perpetrat-
ing trained terror through its
puppets like Cuba and Bulgaria.

The most comical comment of
the article came from Professor
Richard Blackett when he said
the controversial airstrip in ques-
tion was a result of a British
study in ways to bolster tourism.

',_What a joke! I supposeit was .

. cans so quick to criticize their

Britain’s idea to utilize Cuban
construction workers and mil-
itary advisers. Ipsuppose also that
warehouses found stacked with
arms and ammunition were
going to bolster tourism as well.

I am sick and tired of hearing
naive people bad-mouth the
United States. Why are Ameri-

country and never praise it? We
live in the greatest country on the
planet, and I’m proud ofit. I sug-
.gest that if Ms. Austin and peo-
ple like her find the U.S. so
terrible, they find another place
of residence.

In Defense of Pittsburgh

By CHRISTINA CLINTON

We native Pittsburghers , have
learned since infancy how to defend
the place of our birth. From the time
we step past the Mon and go outside
of the city limits, we have to ward off
pollution jokes, Polish jokes (aren't
we all Polish?), imitations of our
accents and learn to laugh when-
ever our hometown is referred to as
“the armpit of the world."

Most ofthe country has a negative
outlook on ourtown. Things like the
movie “Flashdance," with Jennifer
Beals’ “ladylike” language, perpetu-
ate the image. Pittsburgh is known
as the shot and the beer town, the
town with the closed steel mills and
long unemployment lines — a dying
Northeastern city.

What many other Americans
don’t realize "about our city is the
good things. For example, Pitts-
burgh has the third highest concen-
tration of Fortune 500 companies in
the nation, Renaissance II will make
our city fashionable and up-to-date,
there’s more culture here than a
Steeler game and many people don’t
even drink Iron City Beer.

Which, ﬁnally, brings me to the
point of this column. After recently
visiting a friend in Norfolk, Va., I
spent a good deal of my time there
defending my city and,-more espe-
cially, my school —— Pitt.

I had lost a bet to my friend (S.W.
to insure his anonimity) a year ago
when we cast stakes on the annual
Pitt-Penn State game. For some
strange reason, those folks down in

Norfolk actually cheer for PS U;
they have T-shirts, signs and all sort
of paraphernalia honoring, that
school. »

Well, of course, S.W. picked Penn
State and I held true to my school
and picked Pitt (“a foolish bet,” he
said). Needless to say, I lost and had
to travel to Norfolk as a condition of
the bet. It took me a year to fulfill the
terms, but we Pittsburghers never go
back on our word.

During my stay in Norfolk, I was

referred to on several occasions as a -

“Pittsburgh kind of girl.” I had no
idea what this meant but just
laughed whenever it was said.

Finally, we started talking about
“Flashdance” — Pittsburgh’s claim
to fame. Somebody remarked that
the character Jenny Beals played
was also a “Pittsburgh kind of girl.”
Hmmm, I wondered, me and Jenny
Beals in the same league? Now that’s
an interesting thought’.

The more I thought about it, the

‘more I came to like the idea of being

made out of the same mold that the
character Alex was. She was tough,
independent, ambitious, beautiful
and talented. Who else but a “Pitts-
burgh kind of girl” could walk into a
strip joint, waltz past 100 leering,
lecherous men and pull her best
friend to safety?

Sure, I’ll let myself be character-
ized like that. And I can probably
swear just as well, too. Those char-
acteristics Alex portrayed would
make anyone proud if she fits the
same mold.

Actually, Alex wasn’t originally

I from Pittsburgh, but my friends in

Norfolk "don’t need to know that she
grew up closer to Happy Valley than
Pitt.

From that moment on, I wasn’t
too upset when they continued to cut
down my town. I know what it’s like
living in this city. It has its bad
points, like most places, but the
fierce pride and loyalty that is exhi-
bited by the city dwellers make up
for all the bad things about it.

Where else but in the ‘Burgh can
you find the likes of Michelle
Madoff, Lansberry, the “new”
Press, Andre Previn, the “0”and, of
course, the Panthers, Steelers,
Pirates, Penquins and Spirit.

Afterall, Norfolk couldn’t be any
better than Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh
was built on blood and guts and
steel, and the only thing Norfolk is
built on is the Navy (“squids” as they
call the sailors) and tourists from
Virginia Beach. -'

I guess my final burst of pride I

came from our sports teams and
players. If people won’t think highly
of our city because of its accomplish-
ments as a town, at least they can
learn to respect the sports teams.-

weekend while PSU lost; the Steel-
ers won and Oakland’s own Danny
Marino had a great day for Miami.
If nothing else, I could bask in the
pride of our tearris and players.

Did I feel proud to be a Pitts-
burgher? You bet I did. And being
compared to Jenny Beals wasn’t so
bad, either.

Events In Lebanon Confusing  

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

We are used to hearing about
incidents being horrors to the
Israelis, Lebanese and foreign
forces. The past two weeks have
been a horror to the American
people. For a young Jew in
America l983, they've been two
weeks of confusion and inner
conflict.

The days since the Marines
were blown up in Lebanon have
been filled with furious (and

. some familiar) phrases:

“77 Marines dead...90
dead... I40 dead...a cowardly and
despicable act... Marine
massacre...multi-national peace-
keeping force...deathtoll stands
at l40...more bodies found...par-
tial lists of the dead.”

The media asked, what were
the Marines doing in Lebanon in
the first place — acting as sitting
ducks? Is this keeping peace? _

Politicians looking toward re-
election call for a “complete and
immediate withdrawal" of_ the
troops from that region.

Jewish leaders say we must
defend the state of Israel.

And Ronald Reagan says he's
“sorry” while he sends more
troops to Lebanon next week.

I am personally at a loss over
what to think and how to feel
about the whole situation. Like
the rest of the country, I am sick-
ened by the act in Beirut, and I
wonder to what extent the Uni-
ted States should go to protect
our Middle Eastern interests.

The media “asked,
what were the
marines doing in
Lebanon in the first
place — acting as
sitting ducks?  

I cannot identify with my
grandmother, who came from
Hungary and lived during the
Holocaust period, nor can I iden-
tify with my parents’ undying
and unlimited loyalty to Israel,

so many thousands of miles
away.

I am of the generation where
peace is virtually unknown to the
Israelis, where I have not expe-
rienced anti-Semitism in any
form during my life, where get-
ting a job and getting ahead are
more important than the
abstract ideals of Zionism.

The crisis does hit home to me,
however: an old boyfriend is at
Camp Lejeune, and I wonder,
will he be among those going to
Lebanon next week?

This time, we’ll have to do it. ’
As American Jews in a time
where there is so much criticism
of _both America's and Israel’s
actions in the Middle East, we
have to rely on the same feelings
our ancestors have relied on for
hundreds. of years.

We have our classes and
grades and boyfriends and jobs;
when it comes to Marines in Bei-
rut, all we have are our feelings
that this is something right for
the Jewish people.

The feeling is all we have, but it
should be enough to carry us_
through this wave of confusion.

Picture Worth A
Thousand Words

Dear Editor: -

Your one-word assessment of '
the SGB elections was indeed
correct, “unexpected.” Perhaps
the most unexpected event of all
was the strange reaction of The
Pitt News to the typographical
error that led to the miscaption-
ing of the candidates.

As much as I hate resorting to
cliches, I'm sure you, as a jour-
nalist, are aware that a picture is
indeed worth 1,000 words. This
is especially true in elections.
Check out the campaign posters
of any major candidates for the
city elections in November. This
is probably the reason The Pitt
News prints pictures of the can-
didates — acknowledging the
power of the recognition factor.
Often we well remember the face
before the name, especially if we
have heard the person speak on
an issue.

A mistake was made, and
these things will happen. But
unlike a responsible part of the
media (which I hope you purport
to be), you chose not to ‘apolo-
gize for the error. You did print a
correction, but then went on to
fault Mr. Petro for his concern in
the matter. Surely it is an impor-
tant issue to Petro, and I do not
feel his insistence on a correction
was unfounded. _g A

If the response of Greg Petro
“exceeded reasonable limits,”
then surely your response never
met "reasonable expectations. If
an error occurred in your paper,‘
it is your responsibility. (Do you

‘ proofread the copy from the
printer?) Rather than faulting
Greg Petro, it would have been
more nobler to simply apologize
for the mistake and correct it.

Teach-In:

Dear Editor:

The Committee Against the Inva-
sion of Grenada and spokesperson
Gail Austin‘s sophomoric attempt at
“consciousness raising” (Teach-In
Explains Grenada Invasion, Oct. 31)
reminded me of a skit for the
National Lampoon: perfect carica-
tures of ’60s leftists, right down to
Ms. Austin's use of the standard
Marxist cliches and “defiant" ﬁnal
fist-raising gesture.

It is quite admirable that the idea
of the teach-in was revived at Pitt in
response to the U.S. invasion of
Grenada. Unfortunately, this poten-
tially informative and intellectually
challenging event degenerated into a
stage for these ignorant buffoons
acting out their wildest fantasies as
fire-spitting radicals. _

In attacking the U.S., the press,
Carribean nations, Reagan and
everything else but the family dog,
Ms. Austin managed to regurgitate
every Third World banality essential
to the vocabulary-of the armchair
revolutionary, with the possible
exception of “facist pig. ” Two exam-
ples of Ms. Austin’s bombast:
“...another attack in a long history
of racist enslavement, murder and
genocide" and “long live the revolu-
tion...death to U.S. imperialism.”

This type of language is every bit
as repugnant as that used ad-
nauseum by right wingers; secular
humanism, godless communism,

etc.
Ms.

Austin and her ilk are

pathetic little people trapped in the ‘ “

mire of their own empty rhetoric.
This is characteristic of most self-
styled leftists in the U.S. history i

It seems that local activists (Ms. '

policies, though their accomplish- — I 

ments to date are negligible. Never-
theless, they ‘ are committed and

sincere people who can usually '

avoid falling into the garbage heap

of political froth so attractive to Ms.

Austin. -

Of course, Ms. Austin’s ranting
and raving will have absolutely no
effect on the events in Grenada;
however, they are liable to damage

the credibility of the legitimate dis- ‘-
senters, the Molly Rushes and Liane _'

Normans. People like Ms. Austin.

good joke material for everyone

well and Ronnie Reagan.

Graduate Student

Dear Editor:

I couldn’t make up my mind
whether to answer Gail Austin first
or Kevin Bold, so I'll address both in
the same letter. First of all, to Ms.
Austin: All we know about Hudson
Austin and the Revolutionary Mil-
itary Council‘ of Grenada is that
their first act on getting into office
was to slaughter 250" people — in a
city smaller than Squirrel Hill. The
United States was right to invade,
and as far as “imperialism” goes, I
will bet 10 to one that all U.S. troops
are off the island by New Year's
Day.

To Mr. Bold: The idea that “There
is only one economic system com-
patible with freedom” and “its name
is capitalism” is incorrect. This is the
fallacy of the unnecessary either-or
choice. We need not choose between
capitalism and communism;
anarchy, feudalism, syndicalism, tri-

bal /hunter-gatherer economies and

Stalin; they have it or have had it in

a poor way to organize an‘ economy,
but the idea that it “inevitably” leads
to the Gulag is not compatible with
the evidence. Leninism is oppres-
sive; Fabian socialism is not, and

our own home-growm variety of _

century political theorist Daniel

country.

qGroups Plan Orwellian Program

Page .6

«g :By Ron SMUTNY

’ »When author George Orwell pub-
lished -his classic novel “I984” in
1949, readers weregiven a very futu-
ristic and often frightening picture
of what life might be like in a year
that appeared to be very far away.

Well, in case you haven’t noticed,
that seemingly far-away year is now
less than two months away, and
many universities and groups
around the nation are planning spe-
cial courses, workshops and semi-
nars revolving around the Orwellian
theme. “

One of the ways in which Pitt will

- be involved will be through its coop-

eration with a city-wide coordinat-
ing group that hopes to arrange
activities and programs involving
most of the major educational and
civic organizations in the area.

The group is being headed by Dr.
H. Eberhard von Waldrow, a pro-
fessor of the Old Testament at the
Pittsburgh Theological Seminary in
East Liberty. One of the events
already planned is a weekend pro-
gram to be entitled “George Orwell

our culture.
In addition to programs such as

this, the seminary will coordinate‘

and recommend various educational
programs on the theme throughout
the year, according to Philip Smith
of Pitt's English literature
department.

Smith said Pitt is looking forward
to working with this group in any
way possible, but very few speciﬁcs
are known as yet.

“They'll get in touch with us when
they're ready,” Smith, said. “We are
cooperating, so we’re standingzby,
waiting to hear.

Smith also noted that several liter-
ature courses at Pitt are expected to
add “I984” to their required reading
lists,“ including the courses on uto-
pian literature and science fiction
being taught next fall.

However, several instructors are
not waiting that long. According to

the Pitt Book Center, at least four.

literature instructors have already
ordered “I984” for winter term and
more requisitions are expected. ’

Because of the city-wide group’s
efforts, including the major festival
in March, Smith said he does not
expect Pitt to conduct any major
events.

“Since this other group is already
doing it, we feel that is the special
festival, Smith said. “If we can coor-
dinate anything with them, we'd be
happy to.”

Some other departments at Pitt,
however, do not express such inter-
est in the Orwell phenomenon.

Merle Moskowitz, a professor of p

psychology, said he knew of no pro-
grams being planned by the depart-
ment in regard to the theme.
Although Moskowitz expressed
his feeling that “I984” is an “excel-
lent novel,” he said he didn't see how
it was particularly significant in
terms of social control processes.

Receives
Grant

By LESLIE ROSS

Carnegie Library has been
awarded a federal grant to reno-
vate its’ main branch in Oakland.
The $388,430 grant is part of a $3
million appropriation. The state
received under an emergency
jobs bill that Congress approved
earlier this year.

Donald Potter, senior asso-
ciate director of Carnegie
Library, said the renovation will
provide the unemployed with
jobs. A main factor determining
the allocation was due to Penn-
sylvania’s present jobless rate.

Carnegie Library applied for
the grant in the summer and 40
other organizations. Sen. James
Romanelli announced the grant
and said, “There’s no doubt that
all the applications were deserv-
ing, but the dual purpose was to _
improve library service and '
create jobs for the unemployed.
All factors considered, I believe
our. area was in slightly greater"
need.” I
. Potter said bids will be taken '

' by various construction compan-

ies, and a decision will be made
on or before Dec. l, 1983, as to is

Ronald Ribman, author of
“Cold Storage,” which opened
last month at the Famous Rider
Theater, was very surprised to
learn that one of his plays had
ﬁnally made it to Pittsburgh. He
had every right to be.

Having received his doctorate

5,, degree in English literature at

Pitt in 1962, he has gone on to

E
graduating with if BA in business
administration. After two years
in the army, he returned to Pitt,
receiving his MA in English
literature. .

“I took a writing course at Pitt
on plays for television, and I

‘Professor Discusses  

2 Community Rights

i_, ..

By JOHN GAMBESCIA
“The National Park Services are
‘ gradually killing off many small
communities as an attempt to pre-
seve the natural wilderness,” said
Joseph L. Sax, professor of law at
the University of Michigan.

Sax spoke yesterday at a lecture
entitled “This Valley Shall Not Die:
Managing Resources as if People
Counted,” as part of the Pitt law
school’s Distinguished Mellon
Scholar Lectures.

“The rights of many communities
are often called into question when
the Park Services begin to close in
and slowly but surely wipe out all the
families,” Sax said. What is occuring
is that these communities just
happen to be within the boundaries
of newly established National Parks,
and the Park Services merely buy

the families-off until all of them are
vacated. Sax said that in the early
days of National Parks, this~prob-
lem of deporting did not exist
because the land was, for the most
part, all wilderness and not occupied
by enough families to cause any
major disturbances. However, as the
communities began to enlarge and
the National Parks slowly
expanded, this conflict of interests
surfaced very quickly.

“These families "have several
options open to them," Sax said.

“They can either totally sell out to V

the Park Service, make a deal to stay
there for only a extended period of
time or ﬁght it to the end."

Recently, the Park Services have
become more concerned with the
rights of these families, but it still

Allocations of funds has been a
problem for the Panhellenic Coun-
cil, according to Murphey, and he
wants to work with them to make
sure it doesn’t remain one for the
next Panhel leaders.

“We’ve seen some serious prob-
lems with their organization,” Mur-
phey said. “Panhel has a problem
dealing with allocations because
they aren’t familiar with the
process.”

“There were problems,” Panhel
president Lynn Weinberg said.
“When we had our transition, the
stuff from the previous board was
thrown in our laps and we had three
weeks to pull everything together.”

Murphey said Panhel’s problems
are an example of how a group can
get in trouble because of a lack of
communication between the Alloca-
tions Committee and the group.

‘Windows of Heaven’

Showcasc,- Friday, November .. I98 

Dirty Danes

By LINDA HENRY

The University of Pittsburgh
Theater Company is doing some-
thing different this year — running
two plays in alternating repertory
and in so doing, has had to operate
with various inherent risks. Pres-
ented with Good- on the Stephen Fos-
ter Mainstage as part of the Jewish
Playwriting Conference is The Win-
dows of Heaven by Shimon Wincelberg.

The play strives to be Chekhovian
in that it is more about how people
relate to one another and survive
under dire conditions than about any
actual conflict «or character change.
Extremely important in any relation-
ship play is the set — /problem
number one when running two
shows together. A set had to be
designed to facilitate both plays with

minimum change-over and a unify— ‘

ing theme. The huge Star of David
raked over the entire stage worked
perfectly for Good but not so well for
Windows.

It is impressive to look at, dark and

dreary except for spattering of bright.

Slow Dancing

By JONATHAN KUNKEL

Slow Dance on the Killing Ground, now
being performed by the -Point Park
Theatre Company, is yet another
intense confrontation drama — a
type of play that's being done by too
many theater ‘companies in Pitts-
burgh at one time. Few local theaters
now have a comedy playing. It's my
guess that the Pittsburgh theater-
goer is probably sick of leaving the
theater in a depressed and upset
mood.

Slow Dance, written by William.Han-
ley is, nonetheless, a well-written
play performed by a strong ensemble.

Set in a small shop in a warehouse]

‘ ‘factory district of Brooklyn on June 1,

1962, Slow Dance has three characters;
Glas, Randall and Rosie. All three are

making fake oriental rugs out of dis-
carded clothing from Concentration
Camp victims). Living cubicles‘ar"e"set
behind curtains for each inhabitant
between the points of the star. This
leaves a wide open playing space for
actors who are supposed to be
affected by the oppression of the cir-
cumstances of being cramped
together under horrendous "stress.
There is too much freedom of move-
ment onstage and too much access
outside with frequent use of a down-
stage right entrance; it is never clear
where the actors are coming from.
Another risk in running two shows
together is inavailability of actors.
The Pitt Theater Department is
growing in both quality and quantity,
but there are still not enough expe-
rienced students to cast two shows
together, so some of the older charac-
ters in this show were played by older
actors from Pittsburgh Community
Theaters.There was a marked differ-
ence in acting style between these
actors and the university players (all
talented M.vF.A. students). This
resulted in a disjointed ensemble
effect, with almost everyone eventu-
ally playing in their own little world,

running from something either phys-

ically or mentally. It is through this

”running” that they meet and even-
tually help each other through their
problems.

Hanley cleverly calls each one of
the three acts by a certain name. ”Pas
de Deux,” the name for the first act,
means -dance for two.

In this act, Randall runs into Glas’s

shop, obviously running away from '

something. 'From this point on, and
for the rest of the act, the two get to

A know each other by talking, arguing, ~ '
and eventually threatening each

other. This ”meeting” is verysimilar
to the way two dancers who don't
know each other dance. First they
start slowly, sometimes tripping over
each other, then as they. get’ the hang
of the dance, they begin to become

creating caricatures in a play where
character relationships are of utmost
importance.

Which brings me to the script. The
Windows of Heaven is based on a novella
by Rachmil Bryksentitled A Cat in the
Ghetfs and was originally produced

.under- the same name. It is a moving

The second act is ”Pas de Trois,’
dance for three. The third ”dancer” is
Rosie, a young girl who loses her way
to ‘her abortionist. This act is set up
similar to the first act, in that the
three characters learn more about
each other, and in turn, learn more
about themselves. A A

The third act is ”Coda,” which not

where the characters are headed.

Slow Dance is filled with rage and

anger. Many times during the play,
Hanley has the characters yelling and
screaming at each other. Hanley also
refers to the outside world as the ”kil-

ling ground,” and the dancers on this ‘
”killing ground’.’ are the characters in ‘

his play. Hismain theme is that peo-
ple made the “killing ground" what it

There are lines which, when read,‘

Somebody says "new music," and

They are all likely answers. Notice

forgotten, is America, land of the
free, home of Ronnie and Nancy and
a place where we repeatedly ignore
our own musical talents. Glance at

of Anglo bands will stare down at you
from their lofty perches. How can a

while our own Yankee bands usually

skinny, pale youngsters with funny

just plain ignorance. American new

counterpart, but it's rarely given the
chance to progress past infancy. Wit-

selves to be called something as silly
as "Boy George.” They play’Ameri-
can music; their debut LP, Violent.
Femmes, is an exposed, pulsating slice
of flesh and blood; in more concrete
terms, these guys don't know what
the word "synthesizer" even means.
Their sound is sparse and acoustic, a
ferocious blend of folk, punk, country
and whatever else they can squeeze
into the pot. It'll make you wanna
jerk, bop and scuffle, a fact that the
folks who crammed into the Decade
to see them two weeks ago can attest
to.

Listen, if you still think English
bands are where i}:'s at, then by all
means, go pick up the aforemention-
ed copy of Rolling Stone and get your-
self a Mowhawk, but, just in case you
suddenly remembered that rock—n-
roll is an American child....

Milwaukee's not exactly the rock
capital of America, not to mention
the world; nonetheless, that's where
Violent Femmes got together.
According to Gordon, the group's 20-
year—old lead singer/songwriter/guit-
arist, he first played in public with
Brian (bassist) at his high school's
National Honor Society ceremony.
He sang a song he'd been forbidden to
perform (it had a line in it that ended
with a word about the female anat-
omy; the word rhymes with "runt"),

the place erupted in chaos, and he
almost wasn't allowed to graduate.
He swears this is a true story, but
elaborates on the band's origins when

he sees the skeptical glances of the *

jaded interviewer.

"You don't believe me? It's true, I
swear. But if you want something
more...Brian was in a band with Vic-

tor, so they had a relationship going
already. But one time I invited them
down to where I was playing and they
did and that was the first time we'd all
played together,” he says in an accent
that's a hybrid of mid-western drawl
and whiny, New York City (where he
was born) paranoia.

Gordon himself seems like a char-
acter from a Woody Allen film, or
even Woody himself. On stage, sans
eyeglasses and singing in a sort of
angry-young-man stance, he's cool;
offstage, wearing glasses for his
nearsightedness and huddled in a

rumpled raincoat, he seems more like
a nerd. In contrast, Brian is the same

onstage or off. The lanky, 22-year-.

old bassist, looks like the epitome ofa
'60s flowerchild in his paisley—print
shirts and headband. Victor? Well,
Victor's 29, and as if that's any expla-
nation, he's out of his mind. He's got a
wicked sense of humor and continu-
ally dwells on the funny side of any
situation.

That these people seem more like
characters playing roles than musi-
cians could beexplained by their var-
ied theater backgrounds.

"Victor has the most theater back-
ground —— he's a professional actor
and he worked for a few years with a
company called Theatre X that won
an Obie Award in New York," Gor-
don explains. "Myself, I come from a
theater background, mostly from my
parents’ both having been involved
professionally, so I grew up in that.
And Brian's been in some movies that
a film-maker in Milwaukee makes."

Although Victor hopes to continue
being an actor as well as a member of
Violent Femmes, Gordon and Brian
claim that theater never meant much
to them and that they won't miss
acting. ,

"I think my theatrical desire gets
satisfied in doing the [concert] per-
formances, 'cos it's almost as if I
wrote the script and I act in it. We're
also all directors, and I feel that as far
as the songs go, so many of them
have different characters involved

and all, that there's some similarity S

between that and theater. But," he

emphasizes in that annoying but.

commanding whine, "I don't feeel like
I've said ‘No’ to. theater and ‘Yes’ to
music. Ifeeel there's elements of the
theater in what I do."

Could the theater training limit the
spontaneity of playing onstage?

"I suppose it could, but it doesn't,
Gordon responds quickly (and he's
usually the member to do so). "We
really orient ourselves towards being
spontaneous — we don't make a set
list, we just call out songs as we feel
them, and any song at any time could
go anywhere. They've become some-
what formulated as we play them
over‘ and over again, but there are
times when we surprise ourselves.
We don't know what's going to
happen, and the audience doesn't
know, and we start teetering on the
edge...that has to do with
excitement."

As stated before, Violent Femmes
are an American band, and naturally,
like all nice American boys, they grew
up listening to a variety of_Stateside
music. A lot of critics have pointed to
Lou Reed and Bob Dylan as having a
heavy influence on the band, but it
doesn't stop there. '

“A” "We like Lou Reed and Dylan, but

they're not overwhelming influen-
ces," Brian says, finally getting a

chance to utter a few words before -

the ever—talkative Gordon breaks in.
”Growing up, I heard a lot of coun-
try music — Hank Williams, Johnny
Cash...to this day, I still play the origi-
nal Carter Family and just love it," he
says. "Also, show music — Broadway
and all that —- and hymns, church
music (Gordon is a member of the predomi-

nantly black Mount Moriah Baptist Church,

listen to all that stuff."

Violent Femmes are well aware
that they are not the sort of fodder
that something like MTV thrives on.
They're not nearly as pretty as Duran
Duran and their hairstyles don't
imitate ski slopes like Flock of Sea-
gulls’ do. And, although their single
"Gone Daddy Gone" has been shown
on MTV, the band, as a whole, seems
to feel that making a video isn't the

Jhliving end.

”I think those bands that MTV
helps are mainly bands that can't sell
on live performance, so theyvhave to
cover up their inadequacies by mak-
ing some sort of really glamorous
video. We feel that we would succeed
whether or not we had a video. Of
course, it's helpful, but certainly not
crucial," Brian says before the usual
break in by you—know-who.

”I think if we were to be taken off
MTV and never again had anything
on MTV, well... I wouldn't stay up at
night over it," Gordon says in his
usual tone of exasperation. ”I mean, it
certainly wouldn't reeeaally bother us a
lot, although some people might say
’you fool!’ You dummy!"

However, without MTV airplay,
the band might simply be classified
under the term "new wave" because
of their name and their label (Slash
Records, known for signing under-
ground new music groups to its
label), and this bothers its members.

"We don't put out a record saying
’We only want new—wavers to listen.’
We want it to be played for everybody
and let them make their own deci-
sions about it. We refuse to put our-
selves into a category; if other people
do, that's their amusement, not
ours,” Brian says scoffingly.

But not being identified with any
one category can have its drawbacks,
too: ”I suppose, then, it might tend to
keep us smaller and be more of a dis-
advantage...unless," Gordon says
slowly as a new thought occurs to
him, ”we break through to another
level — whatever that is — and then
we become bigger than anybody else.
Maybe. I mean, something that
strikes people as being different or
hard to label —— sometimes those peo-
ple have become the biggest legends
and sensations of music.;..”

    

BRIAN RITCHIE
”Look at Elvis Presley; that has
antecedents, but it was so new that
some people didn't know what it
was," Brian interrupts (something no
one else had been able to do to Gor-
don before this moment). ”Some
thought it was a black man, some
thought it was country. They didn't
know what the fuck it was! And it
didn't hurt HIM not to be classified,
and, hopefully, it won't hurt us."
Victor, who up until this point has
been checking and re-checking his
drum kit, finally gets a chance to con-
tribute something to thisinterview:
”They tried to classify Presley -as a
Negro musician. They couldn't even
play his records up north at first. On

 

Ed Sullivan, he couldn't even dance-
_ they had to show him just from the ‘

waist up...."
Gordon: "And that's what they're

 

This is the second in o'se

' trying to do to us....”

Victor: "That's right, they just
want to show us from the waist up.’

Weeell, although Violent Femmes
don't have that problem in common
with Elvis, they do share similarities:
they both started out on small, inde-

pendent labels, they're’are both mis- g

understood because they don't fit

THE CURSE or LONO
By Hunter S. Thompson
Bantam

If by ”journalism” we mean some
sort of accurate -rendering of the
events of the day, then the members

. of what we now refer to as New Jour-
- nalism seem somewhat off-base —

traitors to what some people might
see as journalism’s classic goal. These
writers give us not our recognizable
reality but rather a bizzare trans-
formed reality-become-unreal.
Whether it be the right stuff of astro-
nauts as in Tom Wolfe or the song of
executioners as in Norman Mailer,
what the new journalists represent is
an America transformed when it is
written down — made to seem
strange in the moment of its most
ostensible normalcy. 1

Hunter Thompson (best known as
the inspiration for Duke .in the

Doonsbury comics) may be one of the E

most disturbing of such journalists,
for his look at common American
institutions or at the marginal eccen-
tricities that ‘run counter to these
institutions is a look that blurs the
boundaries of reality and’ fiction. In
his books, Thompson gives us things
we think we know about (like politi-
cians in his Fear and Loathing on the Cam-
paign Trail) or things we think we
might like to know about (like the
Hell's Angels- in his book of that
name). But these things emerge in an
alienated form from Thompson's
writings. Our familiar space
disappears. _
InThe Curse of Iona, Thompson takes
on one of the great,American dreams
— the all- aid-for trip to Hawaii e_

nor even the mildly disturbed would-
be paradise of "Hawaii Five-0" where
criminals only exist until the moment
that McGarrett announces, "Book
'em, Dano,” and restores blissful
order. Quite the contrary says,
Thompson portrays a dank, dismal,
fetid Hawaii where violence lingers
everywhere, waiting for a moment to
erupt outwards, and where the only
solace is retreat into forms of daily
insanity. In Thompson's vision, fish-
ing excursions turn into condensed
versions of an ugly sturggle with
death; the sipping of drinks at a bar
becomes a way to easily bring out all
the tensions of tourists versus year-
rounders; a drive down a Hawaii
highway takes on all the shape of a
one-way journey into hell.

fever-pitched anxiety of Thompson's
writing rises ' maniacally. (Increas-

of the most interesting bands of the late
’60s and, some people would argue,
the '70s. In fact, this book has very
little to do with the band itself.
Instead, it is a collection of,drug-
induced poetry, prose, letters and
"scripture” written by Dead fans
(OK, Dead-Heads) interspersed with
drug-induced pictures, drawings and
tapestries of the Grateful Dead and
their various symbolic logos.

In essence, this book is strictly for
rabid fans of the Grateful Dead (God
knows there are enough of them).

Book Of The Dead Heads, this work
promises a lot more than its contents
deliver. This should have been
released through the Dead’s fan club
instead of through the usual com-
mercial channels — both parties
would have been better off.

On the other hand, The Doors: The
Illustrated History, though it is similar in
concept to the Grateful Dead book, is
much better crafted and documented
than the aforementioned. While this
doesn't convey the aura of Jim Morri-
son and the Doors as well as No One

butions are the introduction and
acknowledgement). Instead, he pro-
vides a Doors scrapbook that con-.
tains a wide variety of journalistic
impressions of Jim Morrison and The
Doors. What's more is that these
impressions were formed when Mor-
rison was alive, and most of them are
free of the cloudy sentimentalism
that accompanies the majority of
post-mortem pieces on any defunct
rock band or artist.

‘ TIM PAGE’S NAM

Alfred A. ’ Knopf

"The camera became-a filter to the madness
and horror, a means of portraying it. The
only thing it couldn't stop was the stench of
death. No smell more green and putrid.
Chopper and plane crews flying bodies put
tiger balm on scarves around their faces; I
used a bar of Dial wrapped in a GI towel."

— Tim Page

Twenty years have past since its
beginnings, but the war in southeast
Asia — that void we are beginning to
remember as Vietnam — is, in many
ways, making a comeback. There
h'ave been popular songs, magazine
cover stories and a PBS series
devoted to the war. Last week, Amer-
ica welcomed some of that horror and
madness back into its living rooms
and breakfast conversations. There
will be other wars, we know that, but
after reading and looking at Tim
Page's Nam, you know there was only
one Vietnam.

"the metaphor of a journey from

changed in the years since Vietnam,
but the pictures are still the same.

Many offerings have been made in
memory of the war in Vietnam,
including the most silent — life. Tim
Page's photographs freeze a moment
of volatile history. He takes the hor-
rors and the hurrahs and dumps
them on the reader with all the
weight of a 715-lb. B52 shell’.

Page left his London home at the
age of seventeen. One day, he walked
across the border of Laos where an
HO-scale war had started. UPI sent
him to Vietnam, where the United

States was still getting familiar with

the territory. There he stayed for
most of the next five years, intent on
making a living from what he saw.
The hell-bent journalist depicted in

l the final frames of Coppola's Apoca-

lypse Now was based, in part, on Page's
experiences.

He writes little in the book, offer-
ing only small recollections of his
time there, but he does so in a style
that is sometimes as manic as its sub-
ject. His pictures show us the rest,
sometimes in the emotionless black
and whites, but more often in full-
effect Kodachrome. If nothing else,
war in that part of the world was
colorful, and Page captures
bloody reds
against the green backgrounds of

_ jungle and the U.S. military.

Two diverging emotions _are at
work here, but ultimately, there
comes a realization: the photography
is beautiful, despite the ugliness of its

. subject.

"No one was really sane, everyone
was on a point of total numb shock, of
hysteria, a madness that shrinks have
only begun to diagnose,” Page writes.

That feeling is captured in the best
photos in this book. It causes you to
just stop,’ like trying to run fast in a
slow dream. A '

While Pitt and Syracuse slugged it

X out on the football field last week,
. Notre Dame was literally slugging

away at a Southern Cal squad whose
competency emerged sounder on
paper than on Notre Dame Stadium
turf.

Pitt head coach F oge Fazio even-
tually got hold of footage detailing
that 27-6 devastation and concluded
that the Despairing Irishmen of yes-
termonth successfully underwent a
facelift.

A five-game winning streak in
hand, ND’s Fight is back. The first
four were all reeled off on the road,
the USC victory more inspirational
as Faust dressed his team in green
jerseys for the first time since former
coach Dan Devine pulled that stunt
against USC in 1977.

THE FIGHTING

 

 

“It seemsto me that now that they

have all their personnel, they’re
pretty solid,” Fazio said of tomor-
row’s opponent, the test to start at
3:45 p.m. in South Bend.

“They have confidence going for
them. After I saw them demolish
Southern Cal, the team is playing
the way Gerry wants them to.”

Gerry, of course-, is ND’s third-
year skipper, Gerry Faust. After
enduring two cancerous seasons (5-
6, 6-4-l) and starting this campaign
at 1-2, Faust demoted a pressure-
riddled quarterback, found an out-
right successful one as a replacement
and is now motoring a 6-2 team to
possibly its ‘first bowl appearance
since Georgia won l98l’s Sugar
Bowl 17-IO.

“We're a very young football team
that decided to be great and enjoy
themselves,” Faust said. “The young
people are starting to to play and
find success.”

Faust, exhibiting utmost humil-
ity, sticks to unmistakable conserva-
tism when sayihg that. The two
youngsters who have ravaged oppo-
nents with veteran consistency are
sophomore tailback Allen Pinkett

,and freshman quarterback Steve

Beuerlein.

Pinkett already has seven 100-
yard games this season and has worn
out goal lines with 12 TDs. Already
he has amassed 898 rushing yards,
getting 5.4 per carry, and is fourth in
team pass receiving. with 183 yards.

This 5-9, 184-lb. desecrator of
defensive lines packs a lot of power
for his dimensions, first making his
mark when he ran rampant over
_Pitt last year in a 31-16 ND victory.

Pitt linebacker Troy Benson‘

/

refrigerated day and does not easily
forget the l 12 rushing yards, includ-
ing a 76-yard TD roll, Pinkett piled
up.

It is Benson and his 10 cohorts
who will be singularly swallowed
away tomorrow if Pinkett’s power
pack is not unplugged.

“We have a great challenge ahead
of us,” Benson said straightfor-
wardly. “We have to stop the man
Pinkett and the whole offense
generally.” '

That, it might be added, is making

‘Faust breathe much easier these

days. The much-heralded senior
quarterback Blair Kiel approached
the season with mental images of
granite boulders strapped to his
neck. ,

Three different preseason Top 10
team rankings can do that.

After erasing Purdue in a 9-l4-166
passing performance, Kiel penciled
in three interceptions and only cor-
rectly drew 15 of3l passes in a28-23
loss to Michigan State.

‘Then came the big-time embar-
rassment before a national TV
audience on Sept. 24 in Miami. The
Hurricanes slew the Irishmen 20-
0,and in that game, Kiel threw two
more interceptions and never fin-
ished. Instead’Faust'opted for the
freshman, Beuerlein.

“Blair was putting so much pres-
sure on himself,” Faust said. “He
wanted to please everybody: the
fans, the players, people, the
coaches, himself. It was an adverse
thing for him. He wasn’t playing for
the fun of the game.

“We thought we had to take the
pressure off of him.”

Now it rests on the 6-3, 195-lb.
Fullerton, Calif., native. But if it’s
there, Beuerlein refuses to show it on
the field. In the Miami game he com-
pleted 13 passes of 23 attempted,
rang up 145 yards and pulled in
CBS’ Notre Dame Player of the
Game honors.

At his present rate, Beuerlein is
zeroing in on over 53 percent of his
attempts, passing for over 690 yards.
His imposing targets “are just that,
easy to pinpoint. Though only 5-9
and 171 lbs., junior split end Joe
Howard’s 20 receptions have been

valid for 286 yards and tight end-

Mark Bavaro’s 13 for 224 yards.

 

Notre Dame SID Photo

Notre Dame's Blair Kiel, flanked here by tullback Mark Brooks,
has been benched since throwing tlve interceptions earlier in

the season.

But the emphasis returns to ND’s
backfield. Pinkett had a career-high
132 against Colorado five weeks ago
and has taken up the slack since col-
league Greg Bell suffered another
broken ankle in the M_iami debacle.

Pinkett seems inexhaustible,
though Faust differs.

“He’s very unselfish for a player,”
Faust said, “and is playing much
entire games, but he’s not the only
player, and we want to give him a
breather now and then.”

ND calls freshman Hiawatha
Francisco Pinkett’s top aide, and he
has 189 yards at five yards per hand-
off in that capacity. Based on last
year’s performance against Pitt,
though, much will be made to halt
,Pinkett’s free roams through the
field.

“We have to stop Pinkett,” Pitt
line coach Gerry Solomon
remarked.

“He’s got quick steps, dances and
shoots through the holes u_nbelieva-

bly fast,” F azio said. “He tends to go
low, though, and makes you miss.”

“Pinkett is a super back,” defen-
sive end Al Wenglikowski similarly
disclosed. “You just can’t say
enough about him.” .

If Wenglikowski and the rest of
the line are to stop Pinkett, there is
first the priority of overcoming an
ND offensive line that stands liter-
ally as impressive as the Golden
Dome. Average dimensions amount
to 272 lbs. and a shade under 6-5 in
these mountainsides otherwise
known as tackles, guards and a
center.

Somebody inked a carbon copy of

Pitt All-Ainerica tackle Bill Fralic '

(6-5, 290) five times.
“It’s probably the biggest line we'll

‘see all season,” Wenglikowski said. I

earlier in desperate need of solidifi-
cation, now appears to have righted
itself. At season’s sta_rt, Faust lost

Midfielder Nick Wilson in
action against Akron.

By TIM DINGER

Before last Wednesday’s match
against Akron, head soccer coach
Leo Bemis received a plaque from
the university for 30 years as head of
the soccer program.

After the game he received
another gift, a 1-0 victory over l5th-
ranked Akron at Pitt Stadium.

“We played to win,” said Bemis of
final home game of his career. “We
were really up for them. They were
better skilled than us, they had some
better players, and they had a better
record, but our guys played an excel-

I lent game and they deserve to win.”

The game remained scoreless for
close to 72 minutes before Pitt’s
Dave Van Newkirk scored off an
assist from teammate Rich Godfrey.

The Zips were shut down by the
Panther defense and the outstanding
job of goalie Dave Torrence.

The Panthers set up their defense

. to allow Akron to get the ball as far

as midfield, where they would attack
hard to scramble the Akron passing
game.

Despite the Panther defense, the
Zips had numerous scoring oppor-
tunities and three appeared to have

I goals.

Once the ball was kicked between
the goalpost and the soccer net,

appearing to be a goal, but was ruled

no score.
Akron came close once more
when they hit the goalpost, but the
ball took a Pitt bounce, and again
Akron was held scoreless.
Torrence attacked the ball too
soon on one Akron drive, but came

back to make an incredible save,”

stopping the ball when it was half-
way across the goal line.

“Dave played‘a good game, with
few mistakes,” said Bemis, “he can
chalk that game up to experience."

According to Bemis, the Panthers

were just about even during the ..

whole game, both offensively and
defensively, and he points out that
Akron needed that game as much as
Pitt did.

“They .weren't —.just -playing that
game to be there,” he said, “They
were playing for a bid for Mid-East

'NCAA Qualifier._ The loss more

than likely knocks them out.”

By MIKE SULLIVAN

Last year, what many experts con-
sidered one of the best crops of
freshman running backs to come
around in a long time made a major
mark in college football. Players like
Marcus Dupree (Oklahoma), Dal-
ton Hilliard (LSU) and Bo Jackson

(Auburn) were constantly the ‘focus ‘

of attention.

But beginning on Nov. 6, 1982,.
another freshman made a major.
mark and forced the experts to begin
to think “Pink” — Pinkett, that is, as

in Notre Dame tailback Allen Pin-I _

kett. That day, Pinkett ran for’two A
fourth-quarter TD_s to lead the
Fighting Irishmen to a 31-16 upset
of then-No. 1 Pitt.

Since then, Pinkett has run his
way into the hearts of Irish fans and
onto the pages of the ND record
book. _

At 5-9, 184 lbs., Pinkett would
hardly seem to be the one to carry
the burden on his shoulders. He may
be small, but opponents have dis-
covered looks can be deceiving. Pin-
kett is one of the reasons ND is back
in the hunt for a major bowl. .

“Allen has got a lot of pride and a
big heart,” said backfield coach Mel ’
Moore. “Football is important to
him, and this team is important to
him.”

One look at Pinkett’s statistics

this year will make it obvious that he — ’

is very important to the ‘team. He has
rushed for 100 yards or more in
seven of ND’s eight games, tying an
Irish record for the most in onesea-

son. He currently stands sixth in the -

nation inrushing offense and ranks

ninth among all-purpose runners.
His 12 TDs aside, the sophomore

appears headed on a course that

b would make him the all-time leading

rusher in ND history, passing cur-
rent leader Vagas Ferguson.

As an incoming freshman,
though, it would be difficult to reach _

this point upon finding a former All- 5
America candidate (Phil Carter) and ~

a talented junior (Greg Bell) at the
head of the line.

“My idea of playing as a freshman
was playing on special teams and
getting in on blowouts,” said Pin-
kett, who was heavily recruited by

North Carolina and Ohio State. “I

just hoped that when I was a sopho- ‘

more, I could compete for a starting '

spot. I was very patient. I knew Bell
and Carter were ahead of me, so I '
didn’t expect much." 5
Well, there were not any blow-'
outs. but the iobof kick returner was

Panthers have been eying the event
since their season began, back in the
waning ‘days of summer.

Injuries and letdowns are inevita-
 ble, part of the ups and downs all
' teams experience sometimes during

the season, but the knowledge does
not lessen their impact. Setbacks,
like outcomes, cannot be accurately
predicted, are consequently feared
and are not always overcome.

Pitt has overcome and been over-
come in its trek for Eastern supre-
macy and national visiblity. With a
25-8 recore going into this weekend’s
Pitt-Converse Classic, it appears the
Lady Panthers are more often the
tramplers than the trampled. This

5-‘, weekend is one more hill to top, the
spikers’ last tournament on Pitt ter-
ritory before attacking the all-
important Big East championships,
a mere two weeks away.

Conference rival Georgetown,
whom Pitt defeated at the Big East
championship last season, as well as
earlier this season at Seton Hall, is
Pitt’s ﬁrst challenge. The Hoyas are
ranked third in the conference,

of injuries around which he has had
to rebuild his roster.

“We’ve been playing with a
reshufﬂed lineup, which I have been
testing,” Ng commented. “We will

of confidence and that a loss or even
a close victory would cast a shadow
full of doubt across that confidence.
“Our team looks at Georgetown
__as one of two or three roadblocks to

championships (others being Provi-

* dence and Villanova),” Collier
remarked. “Psychologiatlly [with-
out a decisive victory], there would
be room for considerable doubt
when we travel to the Big East
Tournament.

“Our goal is to play well and
remove some of the lingering doubt
as to who is No. I in the Big East."

Saturday morning, Pitt will host
Cincinnati. The Bearcats, coached
by Kathy Kehow, are 23-10. The
Ohio team is paced by hitter Janise
Jordan, a graduate of Farrell High
School, whom Collier believes to be
a threat to his team.

“She is a powerful hitter who can
dominate a match with her spiking,
and I’m not sure if we’ll be able to
stop her."

Collier is also worried that his
young squad may not be able to
motivate itself for all three matches
and may have a letdown in between
the rivalry with Georgetown and the
“homecoming match” against East-
ern Kentucky, which will be played
at Norwin High School Saturday
night. The Colonels were 34-15 in
winning the Ohio Valley Conference
last year.

Norwin High School is Pennsyl-
vania’s premier high school volley-
ball program, having produced eight
consecutive Class AAA state cham-

pionship teams. It isonly ﬁtting then I

that the four former Lady Knights
meeting in the Pitt-EKU match
should perform in Norwin's
gymnasium.

Geri Polvino’s Lady Colonels are
23-15 going. into ' the tournament.
EKU has two Norwin graduates, but
senior Lori Duncan was lost for the
season with a severe knee injury. The

other former Knight is junior setter
_ Charlotte Gillespie.

qualifying for the NCAA national"

At 5-1 I, Gillespie‘ is a strong net
playeras well as Kentucky’s setter.
While Gillespie, is considered the
offensive coordinator on the court
for the Colonels, her sister Sally, at
5-4, could be called the defensive
coordinator for Pitt. ‘

Pitt’s representative of the Gilles-
pie clan has been called the team's

defensive sparkplug and a leader on .

the court by Collier. .

Polvine does not think the sibling
rivalry will manifest itself on the
court.

“Both Gillespies are of the type
that when they take the court, they
concentrate on the competition,"
Polvino commented. “I think they
will focus on the match at hand.”

The younger Gillespie, a sopho-
more, does not appear bothered by
the thought of facing Charlotte
across the net and is excited about
playing at her alma mater.

“I’m psyched for it,” she said.
“There should be a pretty good
crowd there, and it will be interest-
ing to see who they vote for. I think it
will be Pitt."

Kris Wexell, also a Norwin’
alumna, is Pitt's serve,-reception spe-
cialist. The 5-5 spiker has started
every match as a freshman, and is
also excited about returning to the
Norwin court.

“I think I’ll play better because I
know a lot of people there, and it will
ﬁre me up,” Wexell explained. “The
atmosphere wil definitely help.”

Pitt will be in the heart of volley-
ball country, because Norwin is
quite possibly the area’s most
serious spiker supporters. Collier
agrees with his players’ assessment
of the EKU match.

“I expect a large, enthusiastic
crowd at Norwin,” he remarked. “I
think it’s a toss-up; the team that
plays best will win. .

“We’re really on the upswing, pre-
paring to peak for the Big Easts and

the NCAAs, and it will be extremely _
important for us to play out best

volleyball of the season at this
tournament.” I ‘

Scott - “Scooter” Dellett mean-
dered over to the nifty video display

screen and just rattled through his
picks. Usually, the Scooter adds a"

dash of analytical thinking to his
prognostication, rivaling those abili-
ties seen in NBC’s pro picker, Pete
Axthelm.

This week, though, Scooter
skimmed over the games faster than
a wind through some haunted
house.

Then ,there’s Charlie “The
Cheese" O’Hara. Cheeser didn’t
even come in yesterday. He picked
up Alex Bell's invention and phoned
in his picks. That was courteous of
you, Cheese, to take off work, and

“:7

honor the staff with your spiritual ,«;,

presence.

Off the beaten track is Mark A.
Sindler, the “Grocery Bagger” him-
self. If anybody has a cure for
glazed-over eyes that come from
staring at textbooks on into the
night, send the prescription via over-
night express.

If the cure includes the services of
afemale, the Bagger will gladly fork
over the C.O.D. charges.

Joining the staff this week is
“Guest Guru”_ Dan Donovan. Don-
ovan has been covering Penn State

for The Pittsburgh Press over the'«.‘fx

last two years. Now in his 11th year
with The Press, Dan spent his ﬁrst
five and a half years covering hockey
and covered Pirate baseball for four
a half years before picking up the
Penn State beat.

He must love it when the scores
are run up, because three of his picks
are by 30 or more. But, again, he’s in
the majors, while us minor leaguers
endure such deserving things as mid-
college crisis.

Let us pray, though, that a bowl
appearance puts our psyches to rest,
should Pitt prevail over Notre
Dame. Notice the skepticism. Mid-
life crises can do that sometimes.

dle,“ Fazio said. “This is a football
team that’s really gelled, come
together and played like Gerry
_wants them to. It makes ourjob I00

5 » times more difficult.”

“It's another game,” Benson said,
“where we have to be as defensively
prepared as possible.”

More is riding on this game than
merely sustaining composure,
though. No less than six scouts from
major and near-major bowls will be
in attendance. A loss by either 6-2
squad can easily translate into $1
million lost to a whistling wind.

Only thing is, neither coach sees it

Ti «exactly that way.

P.Q. Box 37000, Washington, D.C. 20012

“Now we have the opportunity to
play a good football team on TV,”
Fazio said of tomorrow's ‘CBS
regional telecast. “The players
should have no pressure on them.
It’s a big game; it’ll be a good game
— I look at it that way.

“Too much pressure is on the
team because if it wins it gets $1
million for a bowl. If not, a player
doesn’t want to end up being the
reason for not getting that.”

“We’re not thinking" of it, to be
perfectly honest,” Faust said of an
emerging bowl portrait. “Right now

we‘re just interested in Pitt, and not .

in bowls.

“We’ve had a. motto since the
Miami game: The Ones Add Up.
We‘re just looking at this game right
now.”

A Pitt victory will vault this pre-
season “4-7 team” into a bowl for the
ninth straight year. For now,
though, the situation at hand is
obvious.

“We have Notre Dame in front of
us,” Wenglikowski said. “We can’t
be worried about, ‘Oh, what kind of
bowl will we make it to, where and
when will it be.’ _

“Our big concern is going down to
Notre Dame and playing our kind of
ball.”

1. The “Bullpen” is:
El a good place to stay out of at a rodeo.
El a writing instrument you have to clean up

  By Israel Horovitz 

The_ Pitt _News, Friday, November 4, I983

Pinkett Colors Fighting Irish

continued from page seventeen
offered. Then, in the season’s second
game, against Purdue, Bell broke his
ankle and was sidelined for the year.
That put Pinkett at second string

‘ , behind Carter, who did not have the

size to take punishment for the
entire game.

When opportunity knocked, Pin-
kett opened the door.

“I got a lucky break and took
advantage of it,” he said. “I grew up
fast because I was thrust into the
situation. I'd like to think that I’m
still growing up."

Pinkett did not really draw atten-
tion to himself until the fourth game
of the season against Arizona, when
he scored his first ND TD on a 25-
yard run; It was the only Irish TD of
the game. When he scored the only
Irish TD in the next game against
Oregon — where Carter went down
with an injury — he got the starting
job against Navy.

One touchdown and 127 yards
later, Pinkett showed Irish fans that
he was ready.‘ The Pitt game, which
followed, showed the nation that he
was ready as he scored on runs of 76
and seven yards, piling up 112 yards
on 10 carries.

Notre Dame had a new star.

He finished the season as the ninth
best kick returner in the nation,
thanks to a 93-yard return against
Penn State. He also finished second
on the team in rushing, behind Car-
ter. Despite the return of Bell this
season, Pinkett had won himself the

starting job at tailback. He has not
looked back — except to see oppo-
nents chasing him into the endzone.

What makes Pinkett so success-
ful? There are three major reasons.
First is his teammates. He has two of
the best blocking fullbacks in the
nation in Mark Brooks and Chris
Smith. He has an enormous offen-
sive line that is getting better as the
season progresses. He also has four
excellent running backs beside him-
self in Bell, Hiawatha Francisco,
Brooks and Smith.

He is able to stay fresh by carrying
the ball anywhere from 15 to 25
times a game. So, as the opponent
gets worn down by his teammates,
Pinkett is able to stay fresh and dash
around and through the defense.

Second, there is his physical abil-
ity. Pinkett runs a 4.5 40 and is able
to bench press 375 lbs. His lack of
height is an advantage because he
can hide behind his blockers while
he picks his hole, and his low center
of gravity makes it hard for tacklers
to get a good piece of him, thus
reducing injuries. *

Finally, Pinkett is an intelligent
player.

“Allen has the knack for making
the right breaks,” Moore explained.
“He has a lot of savvy about when to
make the breaks. He also has a
knack of not taking blows, and that
has helped him stay healthy.”

“The thing that helps me is that
I’m never satisfied with what I do,”
Pinkett said. “I will be pleased by a

certain performance, but I am neveié’

really satisfied."

It is the policy of many colleges to
put the picture of a Heisman or All-
America candidate on the cover of
their press guide. Some schools even
devote a number of pages to their
stars. Pitt: did with Dan Marino,
Michigan did it with Anthony Car-
ter and Air Force did it with Marty
Louthan.

Notre Dame does not lobby for its
stars as such. Allen Pinkett’s bio-
graphy, while longer than many of
the other players’, is listed among
the “P’s."

‘As Pinkett does his own lobbying ‘
on the field, he realizes his name
could eventually arise to the top of
the list of all-time rushers (he is

. already among the Top 20). But he

knows better than to let his personal
statistics get in the way of the team’s"
progress.

“[Being the all-time rusher] is a
goal of mine,” Pinkett said, “but I’d
like to? think that my goals and my
success go along with the team’s
goals and the team’s success.”

Allen Pinkett is only a sopho-

1L.
_,' 1'

more, and it is obvious that his sucdfir

cess is important to the team’s
success. It might wear blue and gold,
or it might even wear green, but the
Notre Dame football team knows

' that Pink is what brings true success.

student newspaper, The Observer,
