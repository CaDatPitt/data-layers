Sexual assault on campuses becomes national focus

Student Government Board member Graeme :
Meyer knew something had to change after
he and a group of students were held at gun: .

point on the walkway to David Lawrence Hall
at the end of the fall 2012 semester.

During the 2013 SGB election, Meyer ran‘-_
on an initiative to improve communication  '

student becomes avictim of a violent crime
— including sexualassault. Between 2012

T and 2013, there were 17 forcible sex acts,

including rape, sodomy, sexual assault with
an object, indecent assault and non—forcible
intercourse without consent reported on

campus.‘  - 1

of recyclable paper and bottles and 41 percent
belonged as trash. '

Lincoln, a sophomore environmental
geology, urban studies and ecology major,
hoped the waste audit would engage students
and inspire awareness.

“It’s a great visual representation of the
problem.  It’s a very direct and disgusting
way to see what impact you’re having and
how bad we are at recycling,” Lincoln said.

The results from last year’s audit support
her stance.

According to Ken Arble, who participated
in the waste audit last year and is currently
co—president of Free the Planet, less than
half of the bags collected contained “true
trash,” or garbage that cannot be recycled
or composted. '

“There was a potential for 60 percent
[of the trash] to be recycled or composted,”
Arble, a senior environmental studies major,
said.

The statistic shocked Shea McMurtry, a
freshman pre—rehabilitation science major.

“It’s kind of surprising that only 40 per-
cent of it was real trash from last year,” Mc-
Murtry said.

The waste audit is the ﬁrst of four events
hosted by Free the Planet this week to kick
off Pitt’s participation in RecycleMania, a na-
tionwide tournament that evaluates schools
during an eight-week effort to monitor and
promote recycling. Schools are ranked ac-
cording to categories including recycling

rates per capita, the percentage recycled ‘

based on total amount of waste and univer-
sities that produce the least amount of waste,
in general.

According to Laura Zullo, Pitt’s senior
manager of energy initiatives in the Ofﬁce of
Facilities Management, Pitt recycled 812,280
pounds of materials last year —— accounting
for about 20 pounds per person. The Uni-
versity ranked third overall among all Big
East schools and ranked 33rd out of the 269
schools in the country that participated in
RecycleMania. ’

In the “gorilla” category, which measures
total weight of recycled materials, Pitt ranked
second in the Big East and 11th out of the 357
total schools that participated. Pitt won ﬁrst
in the Big East for amount of paper recycled

East for the amount of cardboard recycled

Zullo said the University’s custodial ser-

vices take measurements for the competition.

the William Pitt Union as well as a tour of

A number of students feel it is important
to recycle on campus. _

Sarah Stein, afreshman pre—rehabilitation
science major, said Pitt provides students
with ample opportunity to recycle.

“I just don_’t think that people take advan-
tage of it,” she said.

Other students feel the school’s recycling -

efforts could still use improvement. V

Hae Min Song, afreshman biology major,
observed that there were no recycling recep-
tacles in the quad.

“I justwish people would be more mindful
about what they throw away if there were bins

to graduate and undergraduate students.
The center is staffed by psychologists, social
workers, psychiatrists and trained graduate
students.

Meyer’s goal is to improve procedures
that help students who become victims of
a violent crime.

“[The police] informed us that the coun-
seling was there, but there was no outreach
from the office,” Meyer said. “Typically,
victims aren’t willing to seek out help, so I
thought there should be a better system for
the police to notify the consulting center.”

According to Meyer, Pitt police and offi-
cers from the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police do
not have aprocedure for alerting the Counsel-
ing Center about violent crimes that occur
off campus.

“It should just be a standard,” Meyer said.
“South Oakland is technically not University
property, but in my eyes, it is still part of the
campus.”

ASSAULT

Sergeantjoe Gannon, an officer in the Sexual

Assault and Family Unit of the Pittsburgh ,

Bureau of Police said he was not aware of
the University’s Counseling Center.

Gannon said if the Pitt police are notiﬁed
of a sexual assault, they take the report and
share it with the Pittsburgh Police Bureau.

“[Pitt police] may or may not turn
around and notify the Counseling Center.
I deal strictly with the police department,”
Gannon said. — ‘

The University and the Pitt Po1iceDe-
partment did not respond to numerous
requests for comment.

Meyer isn’t alone in his push to combat
sexual assault and violent crime on college

' campuses. In fact, the effort to bring about

better services to victims of sexual assault
is becoming a national focus. C
Nationwide ﬁght
President Barack Obama identiﬁed sex-
ual assault on college campuses as “deeply

_ troubling” and signed a memorandum on

Jan. 22 to establish the White House Task
Force to Protect Students from Sexual As-
sault. ‘ _ _ t '
According to the memorandum, col-
leges and universities that receive federal
aid must offer sexual assault services to
their students. The schools are required to
provide information about prevention and
reporting procedures, adopt and publish
grievance procedures to resolve sexual as-
sault complaints, investigate reported as-
saults and take measures to prevent futur
occurrences. ‘
“Reports show, however, that institu-
tions’ compliance with these federal laws is
uneven and, in too many cases, inadequate,”
President Obama said in the memorandum.
His memorandum highlights what ap-

- pears to be a nationwide trend on college

campuses. On the same d_ay that Obama
released the memorandum, the White House
Council on Women.and Girls released a re-
port, “Rape and Sexual Assault: A Renewed
Call to Action.”

The report analyzes data on sexual as-
sault and catalogues the Obama administra-
tion’s previous efforts while looking toward
ﬁirther action. According to the report, one
out of ﬁve undergraduate women are victims
of a completed or attempted sexual assault
when they are a student. The report also

said only 12 percent of these victims will go
on to report the assault to law enforcement.

The report states: “Schools must adopt_

better policies and practices to prevent these
crimes and to more effectively respond when
they happen — both by holding offenders
accountable and givingvictims the help they
need to physically and emotionally recover.”

M A recent case that underscores the prom-
inence of sexual assault on college campuses
hits particularly close to home.

The American Civil Liberties Union, a
nonproﬁt organization that ﬁghts to pre-

serve and defend individuals’ constitutional
rights, has ﬁled a Title IX complaint against
Carnegie Mellon University on behalf of a
female student who said her ex—girlfriend,
who was also a CMU student, repeatedly
sexually assaulted her.

Title IX is a portion of the Education
Amendments of 1972 that prohibits fed-
erally—funded educational programs from
sexual discrimination.

According to the complaint, CMU de-

termined that the assailant had violated the C

university’s sexual assault policy but only

made an effort to continue a pre-existing,
mutual no—contact order that prohibited
the two involved students from speaking
to each other. The assailant was allowed to
remain on campus.

Kenneth Walters, spokesperson for
CMU, declined to comment on the ACLU’s
complaint. .

Walters provided a statement from the
university that said it would not comment
on the matter in order to “protect the con-
ﬁdentiality of those involved.”

OPINIONS

EDITORIAL

CVS Caremark, the popular drug store
chain, has made headlines this week
for taking steps to increase the health
of its clientele. On Wednesday, CVS
announced that it would be putting a
stop to their sale of tobacco products
by Oct. 1 of this year in an effort to
focus more on promoting health to
its customers.

The second-largest drugstore
chain, with more than 7,500 drug-
stores —— two of which are rather
close to Pitt’s campus — will begin
phasing out tobacco products such as
cigarettes, cigars and chewing tobacco
in order to get back into the business
of promoting wellness.

By ending sales of tobacco, CVS is
pressuring other drug store chains
to reevaluate the products they sell,
as well. If CVS, currently one of the
largest chains in the United States, has
been able to implement such positive
measures, other drugstores should
work to further promote wellness by
discontinuing tobacco sales.

Pharmacies such as CVS, Rite Aid
and Walgreens have a duty to promote
the well-being of their customers, es-
pecially since they provide pharma-
ceutical supplies and clinical services,
and selling tobacco undermines that
aspect of the business.

“Selling tobacco is‘ very incon-
sistent with being in that business,”
Helena Foulkes, CVS’s president, said
in an interview with USA Today. “We
really thought about this decision as it
relates to the future as a health com-
pany —- it’s good for customers and
our company, in the long run.”

Foulkes told USA Today that CVS
is beginning to realign with its phar-
maceutical and clinical roots though
its network of 26,000 pharmacists

and nurse practitioners working with
people to combat high cholesterol,
diabetes and high blood pressure.

CVS becomes healthier, bans thesal

While CVS sells $1.5 billion worth of
tobacco products yearly and will lose
approximately $2 billion in sales, the
move has been lauded by President
Barack Obama, first lady Michelle
Obama and Health and Human Ser-
vices Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.

President Obama noted in a state-

macy, providing services to combat
smoking. .

“Rite Aid offers a wide range of
products, including tobacco products,
which are available for purchase in ac-
cordance with federal, state and local
laws. Additionally, Rite Aid also sells a
variety of smoking cessation products

CVS Caremark,the second-largest drugstore-pharmacy chain in the United

States, has two locations in the Oakland neighborhood. MCT Campus

ment Wednesday that, “As one of the
largest retailers and pharmacies in
America, CVS Caremark sets a power-
ful example, and today’s decision will
help advance my administration’s ef-
forts to reduce tobacco-related deaths,
cancer and heart disease, as well as
bring down health care costs.”

Rite Aid, the third-largest drug-
store chain in America — with two of
its more than 4,600 stores located in
Oakland — hasn’t made a deﬁnitive
move to ban tobacco products as of
yet. While the drugstore sells tobacco
products, they also serve as a phar-

and provides additional resources,
including our pharmacists, who are
available to counsel people trying to
stop smoking,” said Rite Aid, in a state-
ment regarding CVS’s recent move.

Walgreens, the nation’s largest drug
store chain, with more than 8,000
stores, has also yet to produce a sub-
stantial move to ban the sale of tobacco
products. '

“We have been evaluating this prod-
uct category for some time to balance
the choices our customers expect from
us with their ongoing health needs,”
a statement from ‘Walgreens said

e of tobacco products

Wednesday morning. “We will con— -

tinue to evaluate the choice of products
our customers want, while also helping
to educate them and providing smok-

ing cessation products and alterna- .

tives that help to reduce the demand
for tobacco products.” '

While CVS is the first major drug-
store chainto prohibit the sale of to-
bacco products, it certainly shouldn’t
be the last. Drugstores such as CVS

have a significant role in providing’
5 the greater community with crucial
pharmaceutical services that better
i thepublic health status of the nation.

When drugstores promote healthy
living, providing doctors and medicine

for individuals who need them,~it is ‘

troubling to think they also advertise
products that harm, rather than heal,
individuals. Of course, many other
marketplaces mimic similar practices,
but with drugstores, places generally
prescribed to rehabilitate and help
their customers in terms of overall
health, the sale of tobacco products
is somewhat Co_ntradi'ctory.
“Stopping the sale of cigarettes and
tobacco will make a significant differ-
ence in reducing the chronic illnesses

associated with tobacco use,” noted

CVS Caremark Chief Medical Officer

-Troyen Brennan in a CVS statement
‘yesterday.

CVS’ move should be applauded be-
cause it’s a move to become a provider

- for the betterment of its customers,
as opposed to -the betterment of its A

shareholders. The move to ban tobacco
products should transcend CVS and
be implemented by more drugstore
branches, namely Rite Aid and Wal-
greens.

As the top three leading drugstores,
they have a responsibility to set an ex-
ample for other pharmacies, and with
CVS leading the pack, others should
follow suit. I H

COLUMN

Digging a deeper hole: Don’t forget the unpleasant realities of the past

Natalie Russel
Columnist

My generation is blamed for the decline of
morality and the tainting of “a simpler time.”
We’ve seen the wholesome black-and-white
footage of white college students doing the

Jitterbug, read countless op—eds lamenting ~

the trend of premarital cohabitation and have
been brainwashed into believing that “Leave
It to Beaver” was, more or less, reality TV-
esque footage of a day in the life of the average
mid-20th century American family. For these
older generations, an action or image is only
immoral ifit challenges the status quo. ‘

But the baby boomers aren’t the only ones
guilty of deifying the past. Millennials also per-
petuate the stereotype with “I was born in the
wrong era,” or that ubiquitous photo shared
on virtually every social media platform:
“When did this (bikini photos of emaciated
modern celebrities like Keira Knightley and
Nicole Richie) become more attractive than
this (close-up photos of ﬁill-ﬁgured, anomaly
’50s celebrities such as Elizabeth Taylor and

blips, such as the genocide of six millionjews
and hundreds of thousands ofjapanese casu-
alty deaths from our atom bombs, but look at
this old black—and—white photo of the white
nuclear family gathered around the radio —
simpler times. Admittedly, my generation isn’t
much betteras far as war is concerned, butfor
what it’s worth, we have yet to break World War
II’s record for highest death toll. Still, the point

is that this isn’t even included i11 mainstream -

moral analyses.

What’s wrongwiththis —asidefromitbe—
ing empirically wrong — is that this mindset
reveals how we prioritize our morals in the
United States.Just take a look at movie ratings.
A ﬁlm in which a woman is brutally dismem-
bered by a chainsaw (“The Texas Chainsaw
Massacre”) is rated R, but a ﬁlm where a
woman is receiving consensual oral pleasure
(“Blue Valentine”) has to ﬁght to overturn an
NC-17 rating. How did the United States be-
come so puritanical and backwards that moral
police like the Motion Picture Association of
Americawill immediately slap awarning label
on movies’ with nudity and “sexual conten ”

when actually we’re just indifferent to it. It’s
just background noise, a useful plot device
for video games.

What lies at the heart of this willful blind-

ness and gloriﬁcation of the past is the fear of
change. And it’s this phenomenon that makes
intuitive immorality (speciﬁcally, violence)
fade into the background. We never had to
answer those moral questions because they
were never questions to begin with. War just
simply was and is. "

It’s existed since the dawning of civilization,
and it’s frequently sanctified in religious texts
(see: holywar) —— inwhich many claimto base
their moral beliefs. Unsurprisingly, these same
texts rank sexual immorality as a sin worthy
of death and damnation. Given this cultural

l context, it’s notallthat surprisingthat violence

is less alarming and less newsworthy, partly
because it’s nothing new and partly because the
United States rarely has to witness it ﬁrsthand.

But even aside from the moral complexities
of war, what we know about the wholesome-
ness of the past and the decay of the ﬁiture is an
illusion. We’re givenaﬁltered history from the
still-accessible media of the past and selective
accounts ofl1istor_y, followed by aﬁiture made

up of paranoid guesses (see: Glenn Beck’s The
Overton Window).

On a psychological level, what is it that
makes us so reﬂexively build shrines of the
past and feel indifferent or even disgusted
with the present‘? It’s a kind of generational
nostalgia— alongingfor the past notbecause
it was actually better or happier, but because
it’s been embalmed with that evasive dream
drool that only lets you see the good things.
Or maybe it’s just because retrospect is always
a more comfortable viewpoint. Or maybe it’s
some psychological coping mechanism of not
consciously acknowledging unpleasant reali-
ties of the past — like the reason you always
miss your crazy ex.

Or maybe it’s as Spike Jonze says: “The
past is a story we tell ourselves.” And maybe
disappearinginto afantasy-ﬁlled pastis akind
of cowardly escapism to avoid the very real
and complicated questions that_are actually
relevant to our lives.

The question to ask is whether or not the
fractional possibility of a utopian dreamﬁiture
is worth the discomfort of facing today. I

f‘The Lego Movie”

Directed by: Phil Lord,

Starring; Chris Pratt, Win  
‘Ferrell, Elizabeth Banks

'Grade::.-A9 2

From afar, 5‘The Lego Movie” mayrseem like a
shameless cash—in on a recognizable toybrand
in the veintof the recent G.I. Joe movies or
‘Battleship,” but upon proper examination, the
ﬁlm is far more of a nostalgia-driven comedy
enriched by razor—sharp writing, 1ight—speed
pacing and wondrous animation.

But there was little reason to worry about
5 the ﬁlm’s potentially abysmal results, con—
sidering the talent behind it. Budding writer-
_ director duo Phil Lord and Christopher Miller

1: have swiftly and faultlessly marched to the
throne of comedy kings in their short time
together and haven’t missed a single step with
3 their latest creation.

y_ Following“CloudywithaChance of Meat-

*2 balls” — arguably the ﬁinniest anirnatedﬁlm
: in recent memory — and the hilarious sur-
:? prise thatwas “21Jump Street,” directors Lord
and Miller have kept their promising streak
of success surging forward with “The Lego
Movie,” which boasts a similarly infectious
high-spiritedness and a number of self—refer-
ential jokes whizzing by so fast that multiple
viewings will be necessary to catch the movie’s
‘? more subtle gags.

,4 The unexpectedly complex story revolves
5 around the deﬁnitively normal Emmet
(Chris Pratt). His happy but empty existence
 is shaken up once he is presumed to be the
“Special,” the most important master builder
inthe Lego universe, and prophesied to over-
 throw dystopian—esque dictator Lord Business

conﬁding in us the trangressions and bitter
memories they fear have brought them where
they are today. This approach closely mirrors
everyday conversation — we rarely witness

-the pivotal points in the lives of others. In-

stead, we must reconstruct them from what
we are told, often while most of the players
involved are absent.

This exercise in reconstruction is ex-

ecuted perfectly, as the characters recount.

their intertangled tales, each one carrying a

new revelation that allows our knowledge of »

their shared morbid past to buildin painful
increments‘. _

Though none of the actors ever leave the
stage, neither do they ever truly interact --
they never touch, look at or acknowledge the
presence of the others. They are simultane-
ously isolated from all others and surrounded
by their presence — and their legacy.

Yet many of the same devices that contrib-
ute to the play’s success are also integral in its

ﬂaws. Though the tales that are recounted

are truly poignant, acting as a conﬁdant for a

single stranger’s darkest secrets — let alone
three strangers’ —— can be exhausting. As a

result, the play’s dramatic revelations feel _

more and more tiresome, which ultimately
cheapen the play’s final moments, leaving
us feeling cold. ~~ , ' f
Yet in spite of this arduous conclusion,
“Madagascar” is a success. It’s a play that
forces us to contend with how the questions
made by one’s absence can at times be more

‘A damaging than their presence. I —

Shawn Cooke
Suﬁ” Wrz'ter

Julianna Barwick specializes in a stunning
brand of simplicity. Characterized by word-

less melodies, choral looping and a penchant‘

for ethereal reverb, Barwick’ssongs layer doz-
ens of sounds and vocalpatterns into one gor-
geous landscape. Her excellent 2013 album,
“Nepenthe,” made small reﬁnements to the

. formula, resulting in her most emotional and

dreamlike work yet.

On Saturday, Barwick.returns to Pittsburgh
for a show at’ the Warhol Theater. Last week,
Barwick spoke with The Pitt News about her

. songwriting process, childhood choral inﬂu-

ence _and her desire for Drake to sample her
music. »
The Pitt News‘: I always struggle with de-
scribing your music to people who haven’t
heard itbefore. Ambient, wordless and looping
are easy adjectives to throw around. But if you
had the choice, howwould you like to describe
or categorize your music, if at all?

Julianna Barwick: It’s tough for me, too, A

and I was just talking about this with my last
interview. I still am, like, not that awesome
at categorizing or classifying the music that I
make, because I feel like it can fall into abunch
of different genres. I mean, I thinkthat it could
be _considered experimental, on alevel. Ithink

’ it could be considered classical, on a level, be-

cause there are so many choral elements to it.

. And it’s kind ofhard even for me to classify still.

I don’t see it ﬁtting into any speciﬁc genre. I’ve
been sayingthis for afewyears, and I’m still not
totally sure what genre it falls into perfectly. Do
you haveanidea‘? A

TPN: I wish I did. You mentioned the cho-
ral inﬂuence that is partially rooted in your
upbringing. Could you talk a little bit about

how your childhood church experience has -

inﬂuenced your sound today?

JB: Sure. As a congregation, there was no
church choir so to speak, but we all sang as a
giant group in these cavernous auditoriums
together, a cappella. The music I make is deﬁ-

ter stumbling upon the Piece of Resistance,
which is key to defeating Business, is assisted
by Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), a sorcerer
with knowledge of the prophecy, and the ag-
gressive Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks). Along
the way, many iconic and amusing supporting
characters make appearances —— including
Batman, Superman and Abraham Lincoln.
All are voiced by countless big-name actors
such as Will Arnett,Jonah Hill and Charlie Day.

In addition to the pleasant irritation of
guessing the many voice actors, “The Lego
Movie” is truly a visual wonderland, wholly
realized and astonishingly intricate. The ﬁlm
avoids any sense of artiﬁciality by utilizing a
disarmingly old-fashioned stop—motion style
of animation, which looks far more unique and
handcrafted than any other entirely computer-
animated ﬁlm. Sequences involving explosions
or, in the most breathtaking shots of the ﬁlm,
water, are dazzling. This ﬁlm feels alive.

Though the ﬁlm’s vibrant energy at times
does verge on the manic — the ﬁlm doesn’t
stay inone place for more  ﬁve minutes —
the sure—handed direction of Lord and Miller
thankfully breeds breathless beauty rather
than numbing overkill.

Regardless of what is printed on a box of
Legos, this movie is for everyone. The ﬁlm is so
few in ﬂaws, so free of cutesiness and weary-
ingpop-culture references and so effortlessly
delightful that it is.hard to imagine a depress-

‘ ing type of person who would be unmoved by

“Lego’s” absolute blissﬁilness.

Be warned, however: The deliriously catchy
song “Everything is Awesome” will rattle in
your brain long after you’ve left the theater.

_ This would be aggravating only if “The Lego

Movie” was anything less than awesome. ﬂ

nitely informed by the kind of music I grew
up singing and hearing, so it absolutely had
an effect on me, growing up and singing like
that. Not only just at church, butI also sang in
choirs my whole life at school.

TPN: Did you always have a desire to warp,

those sounds?

JB: Not as a kid, but since I’ve started mak-

TPN: Last year you toured extensively with
Sigur Ros. Your songs both seem to exist in
this open, widescreen space. Did touring with
them change your songwritingapproach at all?

JB: No, it didn’t change my songwriting
style, Iwould say. I’m making music for a few
different projects now and my approach is still
pretty much the same. But that was deﬁnitely
the experience of a lifetime, getting to travel

itwas deﬁnitely inspirational in several ways.

TPN: So was that the widest tour you’ve
been on?

JB: It was deﬁnitely the longest tour and
the hugest audiences, for sure. Thousands of
people every night, gigantic spaces — that was
deﬁnitely new. Deﬁnitely a mm from what I’m
used to, but it was absolutely glorious.

I MEN’s BASKETBALL

No. 25tPitt escapes Miami with a59-55 overtime 

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Pitt men’s basketballtraveled to Miami

Wednesday for a rrfatchup with one of '

the Atlantic Coast Conference’s bottom
dwellers, known for having one of the
conference’s_worst defenses. But after.
40 minutes of regulation, the Panthers
had scored just 46 points and were tied
withthe lowly Hurricanes.

In overtime, Lamar Patterson scored

_ 11 of his game-high 25 pointsto push No.

25-«Pitt (19—4,‘ 7-3 ACC) to a’59-55 victory
against Miami (11-11, 2-7 ACC). Behind
the se_nior.’s performance, while the_ game

' ’ hung in the balance, the Panthers ended

' their two.-game losing streak. ;
‘I  The first half was a‘ sloppy one for»
' the Panthers, but’ they managed to carry

- a 29-28 lead into halftime. Patterson *'

 SPORTS

connected on two 3-pointers in the ﬁ-~

nal 68 seconds of the ﬁrst half to give

his team momentum on its way to the

locker room. - V
Patterson’s connections from dis-

tance were his first ﬁeld goals of the.

game after he started 0-for-4 from the
ﬁeld. The forward from Lancaster ﬁn-
ished 6-of-14 from the ﬁeld, making four
of seven 3-pointers and nine of 12 free-
throw attempts.

Pitt struggledgto keep hold of the ball
in the ﬁrst half, turning itoverr seven
times. Miami employed a full—court press
and a zone defense in the halfcourt that
resulted in a number of Pitt errors while
the Panthers handled the ball.

. And with more than 10 minutes left

in the first half, the Hurricanes were in ‘
the bonus after Patterson was called for t r
, a foul on the perimeter. ' ‘ ‘

But Pitt made up for its miscues in the

first‘ half by. outrebounding Miami 21-14‘

and shooting 40 percent from the ﬁeld.
In the second half, the game got even
uglier. The Panthers and Hurricanes
combined to score only 35 points in the
half, shooting so bad that — after each
team shot 40 percent or better in the ﬁrst
half — the teams ﬁnished at a combined

34 percent shooting. '
- Ultimately, the Panthers were able to

avoid a bad loss by winning in an area

in which they usually lose games — the
free—throw line. _

Pitt made‘19_0f‘2’6 attempts (73.1
percent) from the charity stripe, which
included three big makes by Patterson in
the ﬁnal minute of overtime to gain ﬁnal

separation from the Hurricanes.._Oppo- *
site the Panthers, Mia-mi ﬁnished 14-of- 1 -

In a game separated by so thin 3 mar-
gin, free throws became Pitt’s edge and
Miami’s undoing —— especially at the end
of regulation, when Manu Lecomte made
1-of—2 after he was fouled on a drive to the
basket by point guard James Robinson.

Prior to_ his miss, Patterson went
1-for-2 from the line ‘about a minute
earlier, which allowed Rion Brown to
hit a 3-pointer that put Miami up 45-
44 with 26 seconds to play. Patterson
atoned for his miss with a layup on the
next possession. _

Brown ﬁnished as Miami’s leading
scorer with 21 points on 7-of-14 shoot-
ing. The senior guard did most of his
damage from beyond the arc, making
four of nine 3-pointers.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

Pitt faces No. 9 Maryland on
A the road after home loss

Dave Uhrmacher
Senior Stajf Wrz'ter

Three days after dropping a home contest
to a talented but unranked Georgia Tech
team, the road does not get any easier for
the Pitt women’s basketball team.

The Panthers travel to College Park,
Md., to take on the No. 9 Maryland Ter-
rapins on Thursdaynight at the Comcast
Center.

Pitt (10-12, 2-6 ACC) could not contain
two of the ACC’s premier scorers, Georgia
Tech senior Tyaunna Marshall and fresh-

man Kaela Davis, on Monday, as the two *

scored 23 and 16 points, respectively, en
route to a convincing 11-point victory.

In order to not suffer the same fate
against a talented Maryland (17-4, 5-3 ACC)
squad, the Panthers will have to ﬁnd away
to neutralize Maryland senior forward
Alyssa Thomas. ,

Thomas, a Harrisburg native, is a Na-
tional Player of the Year candidate and
will once again create matchup problems
for a Pitt team that has struggled against
opposing post players since 6—foot—11 cen-
ter Marvadene “Bubbles” Anderson was
injuredin late December.

The Terrapins’ two-time reigning ACC
Player of the Year is averaging 18.4 points
and 11 rebounds per game -and is coming
off a stellar performance in which she re-
corded the ﬁfth triple-double of her career
in a 15-point win over Syracuse on Sunday.

The tall task of covering Thomas will

  ae

135m gm Stfggt  Ti>:iner.co:n/ ‘
rm www.BiUsl’l'E)<<:>fiC.com

once again be up to senior forward Asia
Logan, who has shined on the offensive
end recently, posting double-ﬁgure scoring
outputs, in three straight games.

Logan, making a homecoming on
Thursday to the Baltimore, Md., area
where she grew up, has been scoring in
bunches but is still plenty responsible for
the deficiencies in the paint on defense.

Georgia Tech posted 42 points in the
paint on Monday, Duke posted 50 down

low just a week before that and Notre Dame’

posted 46 points 10 days before that. .

Plain and simple, it is a problem for
which Logan and head coach Suzie McCon-
nell—Serio both have to take responsibility.

“It has been something for us all year,
being undersized,” McConnell—Serio said

_ after the loss to Georgia Tech onMonday.
“Once we lost Bubbles, we became so small
inside. We start four guards, and we realize
that is why we need to be more efficient
on_ the offensive end, because of the size
difference on the defensive end.”

The Panthers will have to factor into
their preparations that Maryland is the
ACC’s top rebounding team, as the Ter-
rapins outrebound opponents on average
by more than 11 boards per game.

The game will be won inside, but a
Maryland team that reached the Sweet
Sixteen last season and returns four of ﬁve
starters is expected to dominate beyond
the arc, as well.

SIGNING DAY

their freshman seasons, the opportunity
may present itself for players ofjames’ and

e Jennings’ caliber to immediately carve out

roles on the ﬁeld every Saturday.
“I think Adonis is a special player and

has achance to make an impact sooner

than later,” Chryst said. “h[He] has very

good size, extremely strong, powerful, ,

and he was a part of a really good football
team.” ,

In addition tojennings, Pitt also netted
local receivers Elijah Zeise (North Allegh-
eny) andJaQuan Davidson (Elizabeth For-
ward). Wide receivers coach Bobby Engram
hopes to,see his new receivers put their
best foot forward as soon as possible.

“The one thing that the guys in the re-
ceivers room knogvxis it’s all about compe-
tition,” Engram said. “We’re a team, but
we’ve got to be the best that we can be to
make plays and help us win games.” -

Butjennings, in particular, is possibly
the player Engram and the rest of the Pitt
staff may be most excited about.

“We expect big things from Adonis com-
ing in,” Engram said. “I think he’ll comple-
ment another pretty good receiver we’ve
got in [Tyler Boyd] .” .-

Defensively, the Panthers added a num-

A ber of two-star and three—star players, in— —

cludingjalen Williams and Patrick Amara.

“With [Jalen] and Patrick, we’ve got
two rangier type of safeties,” Chryst said.
“Both can run, both have good ball skills.”

Defensive coordinator Matt House al-
ready has onehsafety he must replace this
season with the departure of Jason Hen-
dricks, while current starter Ray Vinopal
enters his senior year this fall. For Amara
and Williams, the early chance at playing
time is there for the taking. ‘

“Patrick’s a guy that’s a dynamic play-

maker,” Housevsaid. “He’s got great ball
L skills, he’s a ferocious tackler.”

According to Rivals, Chryst’s third
class ranks. in between his ‘ﬁrst and sec-
ond. The third—year head coach’s Class of
2013 ranked No. 35, while his ﬁrst ranked
No. 47 in 2012.

“We’re excited about the group because
of who they are, as much as the types of
players they are,” Chryst said. “Today’s
the day when you hope you get better as
a team.” |
