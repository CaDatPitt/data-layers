Senior Staff Writer

Growing up, Alison Babusci was
never given a Barbie by her mother.

Monday night, however, Barbie dolls
and Barbie clothes surrounded Babusci as
she presented “Deconstructing Barbie” in
the Frick Fine Arts Auditorium.

Babusci is a native Pittsburgher and
professional storyteller who first present-
ed “Deconstructing Barbie” in 1999 with
director Daniella Topol from Carnegie
Mellon University. She has since contin-
ued performing the show, while Topol has
moved to New York City.

Babusci, sporting stylish hair, make-
up and an all—black ensemble, sat bare-
foot by a clothesline of Barbie outﬁts and
began to tell the story of her life, from
childhood to the present.

“There were not a lot of things that
were forbidden [in my childhood],” she
said. .

Babusci explained that her parents
were politically active hippies of the
early 1970s, and while politics and sex
were frequently discussed at the dinner
table, Barbie dolls and Easy—Bake ovens
were not allowed.

While her friends were eating Jif and
playing with Barbie dolls, Babusci was
eating greasy peanut butter from the co-
op, she said.

  all:

She also reminisced about her first
“best friend,” Jenny, a rich, spoiled, little
girl who told Babusci that they could not
be friends anymorerwhen Jenny went off
to private school.

“I was like the dollar—store Barbie
with the messed—up hair and the knees
that don’t really bend,” Babusci said.

She continued her story, comparing
different Barbies to different things she
experienced as a young woman.

Growing Up Skipper, a doll that
sprouted breasts when her arms were
cranked and became flat-chested again‘
when they were turned in the opposite
direction, was used as an example for
Babusci’s first stepsiﬁto womanhood.

While Skipper’s chest could be
enlarged and shrunk, Babusci admitted,
“mine weren’t going’ anywhere.”

She told of the humiliation of being
the first in her class to wear a bra and
described the humiliation of shopping in

la Downtown department store’sl teen

underwear section — in front of a win-
dow looking out onto Forbes Avenue.

Her girlfriends soon followed her
lead, she said. She went on to tell about
her first kiss and wearing her first pair of
designer jeans.

“I had turned myself from schoolgirl
to teenager,” Babusci said.

When Babusci entered college at
American University, she admitted that

Barbie doesn’t always mimic life

there were “Barbies everywhere.”

When her teacher/boss tried to put
the moves on her and invited her to go
camping, Babusci felt sexually harassed
for the first time. .

Babusci decided to go to the woman
in charge of the theatre department, only
to be dismayed by the woman’s response.

“She said, ‘Well, look at‘ yourself,
Alison,” Babusci said, adding that the
teacher had commented on her bust size.

“Oh, I meant to wear the small ones
this semester,” Babusci reported replying.

Barbie doesn’t have these problems,
though, Babusci said. 4‘

“Where’s my Sexual Harassment-
Barbie?” she asked the audience.

. Babusci mentioned several other
speculative versions of Barbie before the
conclusion of her program. She talked
about Art Teacher Barbie — “never mind
she doesn’t have any underwear” — and
the controversial, pregnant Midge that,
despite coming fully accessorized with
baby gear, did not come equipped with a
father. - A

“I think it was G.I. Joe,” she said of
the unborn child’s father.

The event ended with a panel discus-
sion among Babusci and Pitt professors
Mary Duquin, Michael
Maureen Porter and Carrie Rentschler,
who’gave feedback and ‘answered ques-
tions from the audience

SODAS furthers department
goals of education, diversity

SODAS, page 1

“We want to educate the campus
about our culture and [the] lack of
diversity that there really is,” James
said, describing the goals of his organi-
zation. “We want to spread conscious-
ness of different cultures and increase
diversity on campus. We also want to
teach others about the correct history of

.. the African and African—American peo-

ple.”

‘ Those pursuing a major within the
Department of Africana Studies learn to
break past the stereotypes generally
associated with Africa, which involve
images of things such as AIDS, killer
bees and people who live in huts, James
said. The courses availablecover such
topics as theatre, music, dance, revolu-
tions, African—American movements,
Caribbean slavery and women’s contri-
butions to the Civil Rights Movement.

While these topics are diverse and
may not seem to apply to most profes-
sions, James made it clear that it is just
as easy to get into law school or med-
ical school with an Africana. Studies
degree as it is with any "other.

In fact, it is possible that graduates
with this degree will discover that they
have a slight advantage in the job mar-

ket, because many employers like to see
that their employees have knowledge of
worldly topics, James said.

SODAS hosts many special pro-
grams, including an African Drumming
workshop and an African Dance work-
shop. These programs are open to the
entire campus so that all who are inter-
ested can gain knowledge on the topics.

The group also hosts Akwaaba, a
welcoming ceremony designed for stu-
dentsand faculty interested in learning
about the mission and programs of
SODAS. The program also covers some
of the opportunities available to those
majoring in Africana Studies.

Students in the Africana Studies
department had trouble communicating
with alumni‘, as well as among.them—
selves, before SODAS was formed,

James explained.

“Students would graduate, and

that’s it,” he said. “Alumni would never

have a link to the department. Also,
there was no place for students to come
meet.” - ,

Now, around the time of ﬁnals, stu-
dents and faculty are invited to come
enjoy a study break in the department.
This allows students to chat with their
professors, as well as with other stu-
dents.

Other acts included Be Bop Cola,

to raise awareness for WPTS.
Although many of the acts were

C1ark’s Age Discrimination Countdown

10: Ralph Andrews, a 76-year-old
Californian man who produced game
shows in the 1960s and 70s, ﬁled a law-

suit against the ever-ageless Dick Clark

for alleged age discrimination after Clark
refused to give him a job based on his
age, according to Andrews’ suit.
9: Clark allegedly wrote, in a letter to
Andrews, that people their age “were
‘considered dinosaurs,” which conﬁrms
reports that Clark did emerge during the
Jurassic Period. The letter, included in the
lawsuit, also states that, “The business is
_ 8: Andrews has ﬁled a lawsuit
against Dick Clark, Dick Clark
Productions and Mosaic Media Group,
claiming-‘that Clark violated the Fair
Employment and Housing Act, which
states that it’s illegal for an employer “to
discriminate against a person  based
upon that person’s age.”
7: Not hiring every older person who
applies isn’t discrimination. Andrews

claimed that he and Clark have known

each other for 40 years, therefore making
the idea that Clark discriminated solely
based on his age unlikely.

6: Being a dinosaur doesn’t just refer.
to age; it refers to a mindset. Game shows
being marketed to young audiences need
people who know their market and, in
effect,  young.”

5: Because Clark allegedly con-
versed with Andrews for a year, off and
on, and knew him from the business, it’s

fair to assume that Clark could judge
Andrews’ mindset, and could determine
whether or not he was compatible with
his company’s agenda.

4: Clark’s frankness, in the alleged‘
letter, was admirable, as was his offer to

alert Andrews should a new project arise
that needed his “experienced hands.”
Rather than hiding behind corporate
euphemisms, he told Andrews the precise
reason that he wasn’t being hired, and
why others were. Perhaps, in this land of

‘litigation, Clark should have been more
veiled than he was in order to avoid this
lawsuit.

3: Mandatory retirement ages do
sometimes backﬁre. Dr. John Fenn was
forced to retire from Yale at 70, but after-
wards won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry
in 2002. He ultimately found fame while
working at Virginia Commonwealth
University, at age .85. Clark’s choice,
which was made with business success’,
not age, in mind may well backfire too.
But wrong decisions are not necessarily
discrimination. A ‘

2: Fenn is the exception, and not the
rule. Clark knows his business — that’s
why he’s been in it for so long. And,
while the Fair Employment and Housing
Act should be invoked in times of clear
discrimination, this isn’t one.

1: Clark was familiar with Andrews’s
work, and decided not to hire  In this
case, it’was Andrews, and not Clark, who
dropped the ball. ~ ‘

Fora Sreaoros.

      
 

The other weekend, I was out of
town, visiting some friends at their
schools in Washington, D.C., and we
decided to go shopping.

Correction: The term “shopping”
would imply that some sort of currency
was exchanged for a commercial prod-
uct. Not the case. At this point in the
year, I’m so deep in ﬁnancial debt to
my sister that I might as well promise
her my ﬁrst—born child, not
that I intend on having any
— ever.

No, during this effort to
boost our nation’s economy,
I was merely an observer,
content to absolutely torture
myself, checking out all the
cute, new spring items that
I’d- have to sell my soul or
children in order to pay for.
It wasn’t too bad. I’m not
much of a shopper — with
the exception of shoe sales.
All those black boots and
strappy sandals that I love just seemed
to scream, “Buy me!” But I was fully
aware of the depths of my ﬁscal despair
and, when I walked into Steve Madden
+ well just twist the knife, why don’t
ya? - -
I’m pleased and proud to report that
I made it through the afternoon pur-
chase-free, ‘although I couldn’t help but
notice a trend in the available clothes
from this year’s spring and summer col-
lections.

Our shopping venture led us into a
store that shall remain nameless,‘ but is
sickeningly popular. It’s notorious for
specializing in T-shirts designed to _look
“vintage” that cost the desperately
trendy teenager upwards of thirty dol-
lars. It’s the place where everyone who
enters its doors leaves looking exactly
the same as one another, and insists on
blaring its music exceedingly loudly --

at the obscenely high prices.

This all-the—rage clone factory had
just set out all its newest line of spring

check it out, I realized that my eyes had
deceived me. These weren’t undergar-

shorts I don are of the

_ mesh variety — when I’m
at the gym or my summer
job that clearly doesn’t call
for professional attire.

All of that aside, my
biggest beef with shorts is that I ﬂat-out
refuse to pay $5 less for a pair of shorts
than I would for a pair of jeans. I spend
80 percent of my waking hours wearing
jeans. I feel that I can justify dropping a
sizeable chunk of change on a quality
pair of jeans. Spending practically the
same on a garment with one—twenty-
ﬁfth the material that can only be worn
three months out of the year — forget
it, buddy.

The shorts being put on the market
this year are deﬁnitely pushing the
boundaries of bootyliciousness, which
only adds more fury to my anti-shorts
vendetta. These suckers are so minis-
cule that there is absolutely no way a
chick can walk around without half of
her ass hanging out. This may be wel-

In praise of old men: Andy Rooney just doesn’t give a damn

In the competitive world of television journalism, most
commentators take a cautious approach to expressing their

views, avoiding potentially offensive state-
ments at all costs.

This leaves a warm, fuzzy feeling m the
compassionate reaches of our collective
American soul, but it also often leads to strong
opinions being glossed over in the name of
sensitivity and political correctness.

However, there is at least one commenta-
tor unbothered by such constraints. This was
reaiﬁnned this week on CBS’s weekly news-
magazine “6O Minutes.” Andy Rooney, the
show’s curmudgeonly reporter who rarely
shies away from telling the nation exactly what
he thinks, has succeeded in offending devout
Christians across the country by referring to Rev. Pat
Robertson and “The Passion of the Christ” director Mel
Gibson as “wackos.”

Rooney, of course, has gotten in trouble for his views
many times before. In 1992, he drew the ire of American
Indian groups when he chided those protesting against ﬂre
Washington Redskins and other similarly named sports fran-
chises as “having nothing» better to do.”

Ten years later, he succeeded in enraging the nation’s
female population by voicing his disdain for women who
report from the sidelines during football telecasts.

    

Andrew J anik

Last February, he made headlines for making fun of the
way the French “lost World War II to the Germans in about
20 minutes,” and therefore had no right to
oppose President Bush’s plan to attack Iraq.

On Sunday’s show, though, Rooney had a
sarcastic message just for two particular people,
rather than a general harangue aimed at a group.
In response to Robertson’s January remark that
God had told him President Bush would be re-
elected in a “blowout,” Rooney jokingly
claimed that God had spoken to him as well.

Rooney quoted the Supreme Being as

Pat Robertson and Mel Gibson strike me as
wackos.”

It was a much-needed rebuke of
Robertson’s insanity; Gibson, whose religious zealotry does-
n’t quite rise to the level of sheer lunacy’set by Robertson
over the past several decades, was apparently thrown in just
for fun. Rooney further quoted God, adding, “They’re crazy
as bedbugs, another earthly expression. I created bedbugs. I
tell you, they’re no crazier than people.”

I’m not even sure exactly what he meant by that last part
about the bedbugs, but they still go down as some of my
favorite remarks of the year. It’s apparent from these com-
ments thatAndy Rooney just doesn’t give a damn anymore.
He’ll say anything that’s on his mind, regardless of whom it

saying, “I wish you’d tell your viewers that both »

oﬁends. .

CBS has been inundated with calls for Rooney’s
removal from the show, but I have to tell you, I thinkAndy
Rooney is my new hero. He’s 83 years old and seems to have
adopted the mentality that, since he doesn’t have much time
left, he’ (1 better just get everything off his chest —- even if that
involves simply calling speciﬁc people “wackos” during his
segment of the show. :

What’s been lost in the hubbub surrounding his remarks,
of course, is the fact that Robertson —— and, to a lesser extent,
Gibson —— really are wackos. It’s just that most people aren’t
willingtosaytl1atonnationalTV. _

The world needs more grumpy old men who go on TV
and rant about uppity women-folk, crazy guys who say God
is talking to them, and the French. I can imagine that, in his
spare time, Rooney yells at neighborhood kids to get oﬁ his
lawn, complains about how much things cost these days and
drives his large American sedan very slowly in the left lane.

The fact that CBS gives him a chance to vent his frus-
trations makes the world a more interesting and entertaining
place, even if Bible-thumpers‘,e/and angry American Indians
vociferously call for his resignation every now and then.

IfBush doesn ’t win the November election in a “blowout, ” it
seems that Pat Robertson will have put the Lord in a very
awkward position Send Andrew Janik your Rooney-esque

On the eve of her 92nd birthday,
Doug Dubois’s grandmother sits on
her back porch in a denim dress,
playfully objecting to being video-
taped. Behind her toothy smile,
she’s all wrinkled skin. Filming,

away. He gently teases her each

she replies, “That’s long hours,” in a
thick,‘Western Pennsylvania accent.
K ‘Meanwhile, on the two walls to
the left and right of the one on
which this video is being shown are
corresponding shots of the woman’s
knees in a polka—dotted dress _as she
ﬂips through a photo album on the
table in front of her. She points to
photos and says who is who and
what is what. Dubois periodically
asks her to turn the page.

with scenes where she smiles with
liveliness and converses with her
grandson, conveys the disquieting
effects that looming death has on
even our most beloved and seeming-
ly unconquerable family members.
There is a sense of cool detachment
aboutthe abstracted hospital scenes.
They seem to point to the idea of
one quietly resigning to grief and
separating oneself from the harsh-
ness of inevitability, even before the
book is closed.

Dubois frames his looping video
with two photographs. In “My
Grandmother points to her old
house,” from 1990, we barely see
the blurred side of the old woman’s
face as she extends a fleshy arm and
curled hand toward the rain-soaked
passenger window of a vehicle.
Beyond the sharp, central diagonal
of the windshield’s frame stands a
modest white house.

The ideas of “passenger” and
“old house” speak to the video
installation’s emotionally stirring
look at the digression of life’s vital-
ity, and the perseverance of memory
and love, in death. ‘

A new era of epics hit themovies thanks to “Rings”

back.

In an era of mag-lev trains and
stem cell research, there’s nothing
like three hours of pre-firearm epic
battles for a bit of eye-popping
escapism. Grand—scale “sword—and-
sandal” hero tales dazzled audi-
ences of the ‘50s and ‘60s and con-
tinue to do so today. There’s still
that jolt of excitement when
Charlton Heston places first in the
famous chariot race of “Ben-Hur”
(1959), or when Kirk Douglas leads

ia rebellion of Roman slaves in

“Spartacus” (1960).

After a grueling dry spell, epics
in all their sword—wielding glory are
returning. As computer generated
imagery pushes closer to realism,
the limitations the medium had in
its early stages are disappearing.
Ridley Scott’s “Gladiator” (2000)
reconstructed the Colosseum digi-
tally. Granted, the set didn’t fool
anyone, but it would only_be a mat-
ter of time before the computer
caught up with the human eye.

pleted, its contribution to digital

Schizophrenic

JC Chasez

Jive Records

v:?n2n2r'1/2

Recommended if you like:
Former boyband pop stars
taking risks ‘

Forget the late—‘90s teen pop back-
lash; there’s no pinning this one down.

JC Chasez’s debut solo album,
Schizophrenic, is a rowdy, raunchy col-
lection of songs that catapults the for-
mer *NSYNC singer out of any linger-
ing boy band» pop image he may have.
Instead of singing to the teenagers of
America about promises of everlasting

‘ - love, Chasez tackles one-night stands,

sex in different positions and masturba-
tion, as well as other fun and racy top-
ics. And instead of sticking to one
genre, as former fellow bandmate Justin
Timberlake did with the R&B/pop
album Justified, Chasez can hardly find
a category that will contain all of his
different songs.

Chasez takes more risks with his
solo album than Timberlake, stepping
completely out of any shadow he might
be under from his days with? *NSYNC.
He co—wrote almost all of the tracks on A
the album, and his unique style comes
through. “l0O Ways” starts with an
enthusiastic guitar riff that emphasizes
the rock/pop feel of the song. Another
rocking track, “If You Were My Gir ,”
plays with guitars and thumping drums
along with the synthesizer in the back-
ground. .

The songs on the album have been
inﬂuenced by all kinds of music.
“Shake It” samples a popular ‘70s song.
A little bit of reggae is nice to hear in
one of the more intense A tracks,
“Everything You Want.” Chasez keeps
the lyrics simple but still meaningful.
There’s a real focus on the music, in
contrast _to the over-produced songs
found on popular albums today that
keep the chorus pumping until the song
dramatically ends. Chasez slows things
down and leaves time for the instru-
ments to show off, ad-lib and frame his
voice.

The ballads on the album are a nice
complement to the high-energy tracks
without lacking in their own appeal.
They focus on more than mindless
romance; they also have themes of
heartache and longing. “Dear Goodbye” ’
is especially powerful, with its simple
melody and the focus on the words of ~
the song, “a love defeated.” “Build My
World” is a melancholy story for any-
one who might relate to the lyrics
“Someone for everyone/But no one for
me.” When the tempo slows down, the
songs are still worth listening to.

worldly feel to it, enhanced by the puls-
ing keyboards in the background as
Chasez sings about missing a lover; He
doesn’t shy away from controversial
topics such as drugs; his album has
many sexual lyrics and a few noises that
are quite common on cable channels
late at night. These frank expressions of
sexuality don’t cheapen the album.
Instead, it helps the album come across
as more honest. The references are no
worse than the typical music video on
MTV. What little shock value it con-
tains comes from Chasez’s squeaky-

clean image he maintained in *NSYNC,
and the music business is clearly over
that.

With all of this experimentation,
there are bound to be a few tracks that
do not quite work. “All Day Long I
Dream About Sex,” a song that is most-
ly a_ monotone chant that repeats the
title over and over again, is only saved
by the techno dance instrumental break
in the middle that lasts almost three
minutes. “Something Special” is over-
powered by the handclaps, and the

’ country music feel doesn’t quite fit in

with the rest of the material.
Still, the album is strong even with

these minor setbacks. It’s obvious that a
lot of work was put into the album.
Schizophrenic is a solo album that
traverses musical genres and styles, and
will appeal to a variety of audiences. JC
Chasez can thank *NSYNC for putting
him in the spotlight, but this is wholly
his album. With music different from
most out there today, Chasez forges new
ground and is well on the way to mak-
ing a name for himself as a solo artist.
If you’re looking for a strong album
with a rich variety of music by one per-
son breaking away from the pack,
Schizophrenic is it.

“Hidalgo”, goes for the gold; gets lost in uneven story-, cliche

Hidalgo

Starring Viggo Mortensen, Omar
Sharif, Zuleikha Robinson,
Louise Lombard

Directed by Joe Johnston

*£n’.‘r

Following soon after 2003’s
“Seabiscuit,” “Hidalgo” shares with the
earlier film the elements of a troubled
rider and his allegedly not—so-perfect
horse. But rather than building up to the
big race, the movie takes the duo
straight for the gold in the clutches of
the Arabian Desert.

Directed by Joe Johnston,
“Hidalgo” is based on the true story of

American courier Frank Hopkins

(Viggo Mortensen) and his mustang,
Hidalgo. Set in 1890, the pair accepts
the challenge of Sheik Riyadh (Omar
Sharif) to enter a Bedouin horse race in
Saudi Arabia. The 3,000-mile fight for
survival across the “Ocean of Fire” is
an opportunity for man and horse to
prove their strength in the centuries-old
competition.

As Hopkins races towards a hefty
prize, he struggles with his traumatic
memories of the Massacre at Wounded
Knee. Hopkins and" Hidalgo conveyed
the message ordering American soldiers
to disarm the Sioux encampment,
resulting in the slaughter of nearly 350

people. Hopkins, whose mother was
Native American, is burdened by guilt
after the tragedy and walks in limbo
between the two worlds of his parents.
Filmed partially in Morocco, the
majesty of the scenery in “Hidalgo” is
the highlight of the film. Aerial shots of
the horses charging across the golden
dunes are breathtaking and almost
enough to compensate for the quasi-
love story and handful of peculiar sub-
plots. '
Although he is told to “ignore her
presence,” Hopkins is intoxicated by

rious daughter of the sheik. But the cul-
tural and religious gap between them is
too large to bridge, and the only result
of their platonic adoration is an angry
father (amusingly) threatening Hopkins
with castration. -
While Hopkins swoons over the
sheik’s daughter, a brittle
Englishwoman competes for her mare’s
breeding rights to his purebred Arabian,

greater threat to her win, Lady

Jones”—style mini—adVentur'e. -

When Hopkins isn’t rescuing maid-
ens or wrestling with his past, the trials
throughout the race are suspenseful and
thrilling. He and Hidalgo, a horse with
a surprisingly vivid personality, ﬁnd
themselves pushed to the limit by the
scorching heat and natural obstacles of
the Arabian Desert. The special effects,
from sandstorms to mirages, S are
impressive, as are the sets comprised of
time-wom and sandblasted walls.

Even with the harsh reality of death
in the desert and murderous sabotage,
Johnston incorporates strangely imma-
ture humor into the ﬁlm. When the

‘sheik asks-his terse nephew if a horse-

shoe would stand erect in his coffee, the
man replies, “At your age, uncle, I think
it’s the only thing that might.” Erectile
dysfunction jokes have their place, but
not in the tent of a lord horriﬁed by his
daughter’s chitchatting with a man,
After a few detours, the race comes
to a (rather sudden) end, as do Hopkins’
anxieties about his cultural identiﬁca-
tion. Hopkins traveled halfway around

THE BEST PLACE FOR PITT SPORTS NEWS

 

Pitt bounces back with
a win over Providence

ALAN SMODIC
Staff Writer

In what was supposed to be
a tight game with first place in
the Big East being handed to
the winner, Pitt turned in one of

4 its best performances of the

season and showed why it is
being considered for a No. 1
seed in the NCAA tournament.
Pitt steamrolled into the
Dunkin Donuts Center in
Providence, R.I., and came out
with a dominating 88-61 victo-
ry over the Providence Friars.
The win moves the
Panthers (26-3 overall, 12-3
Big East) into a first-place tie in
the conference with
Connecticut, - and . drops
Providence (20-6, 11-4) into
third place in the Big East.

The Panthers scored more
points in the second half — 55 —

than they did in the whole over- T

time game against Syracuse on
Sunday. Carl Krauser held the
team together, While Chris Taft
and Chevon Troutman took full
advantage underneath.

“We basically told - our-
selves to come out here and
think of this game as a Big East
championship game,” Taft said.
“We wanted to beat these guys
as bad as we could.”

Pitt jumped out to an early
lead of 5-1 when Taft made a
reverse layup and Julius Page
drained a three.

The game swayed back and

over on a 35-second shot-clock
violation, without even
attempting to put up a shot.
However, Troutman managed
to steal the ball from
Providence’s Dwight
Brewington on the next posses-
sion, which lead to a Taft dunk
on the other end.

With 7227 left in the first
half, Jaron Brown picked up his
third foul, and spent the rest of
the half on the bench, but the
Friars were unable to take

advantage. Pitt shot 52 percent v

from the field in the first half to
take the 33-27 lead into half-
time. ,

After a few halftime adjust-

forth with neither team seeming ments, Pitt came out on ﬁre in
to get into any kind of rhythm. the second half. The Panthers

The Pitt women’s basketball team will have to
wait until next season to end its losing streak,
which the Panthers extended to 12 games after
their loss to Villanova last night, 56-45.

Forward Cheron Taylor came off the bench to
lead Pitt with 10 points and five rebounds, while
senior guard Stacy Moore — playing in her ﬁnal
game as a Panther —— added eight points and ﬁve
rebounds. Kelly Nash led all scorers with 14
points, including four-of-nine shooting from
behind the three-point line.

Also playing in their final games at Pitt were
forwards Sheila Stufﬂet and LaToya Kincaid.
Both playersescored four points each, and Kincaid
grabbed four rebounds for the Panthers.

Pitt ends the year with a 6-20 overall record
(2-14 Big East), while No. 23 Villanova improved
to 22-5 (12-4) and will prepare for the Big East
Tournament. .

“You know, the wins didn’t come,” head
coach Agnus Berenato said. “But I’ll be honest,
we got more wins than I thought [we’d get].”

The Panthers kept the score close throughout
most of the game, but the Wildcats pulled away
when guard Kelly Nash hit her fourth three-point-
er of the game. The shot gave Villanova a 10—poin
lead, 50—40_with 5:31 remaining. . , , . -

The Panthers found themselves in a hole early
after Villanova went on a 10-2 run, giving them an
18-8 lead. . -

Two consecutive layups got Pitt back into the
game.

The first layup came when Moore drove into
the lane and laid the ball high off the glass.
Freshman guard Brooke Hughes scored the sec-

ond, in a play similar to Moore’s. Hughes drove .

through the paint and put the ball in off the glass
to make the score 18-12.

After Villanova stretched the lead back to
eight points, sophomore forward Cheron Taylor
drove and hit a layup, while being fouled. After
Taylor converted on the three-point play, VV1ldcat
forward Jackie Adamshick scored on a layup to
give Villanova a 23-16 lead.

The Wildcats regained possession on a miss
by Pitt guard Amy Kunich, but before they could
move the ball downcourt, Hughes swept in and
stole the ball back. She tossed it to Kunich, who
quickly passed it back. Hughes stood alone in the
corner, lined up the three-point shot, and sent it
through the basket to make the score 23-19.

Hughes would later help the Panthers get
within two points when she dished the ball to for-
ward Jennifer Brown. Brown backed her way into
the paint, spun, and hit the jump shot.

Yankees still need to worry about starting rotation

 

a:  ~»

Spring training has just begun, and
already, some sports writers around the
world are handing the World Series tro-
phy directly to the New York Yankees.
With the acquisition of Alex
Rodriguez, one may consider the
Yankees heavy favorites, but the Yanks
have yet to learn one of the most basic
concepts of creating a dynasty. As the
old adage states, pitching wins champi-
onships. ‘

In its last two World Series
matchups, New York has lost to teams
with clearly superior pitching. Josh
Beckett and the Marlins proved this
last year, while Curt Schilling and
Randy Johnson ended title hopes for
the Yankees in 2001.

The Yankees, this year, have put
together a starting rotation consisting

 

of Mike Mussina, Kevin Brown, Javier
Vazquez, Jose Contreras and Jon
Lieber.

Lieber — 34 years old and in his
11th season — is the early favorite for
the ﬁfth spot in the Yankees’ rotation.
This spot has haunted the Yankees over
the past few seasons, whether you con-
sider Jeff Weaver in 2003 or the incon-
sistency of Ted Lilly and Orlando
Hernandez before him. Lieber has only
pitched two above-average seasons in
his career and sat out all of last_year to
undergo Tommy John surgery.
Historically, Major League pitchers
coming back from this surgery have
disappointing returning seasons. Kerry
Wood struggled in 2000, Matt Morris
was forced to pitch exclusively out of
the bullpen, and Kris Benson still has-
n’t fully recovered‘ from the extensive
surgery. ' ,

Contreras — 32 years old and in his
second season — was the preseason
favorite for Rookie of the Year in 2003,
but failed to even pitch in 100 innings
for the Yankees. He started off slow
and eventually got hurt, which caused
him to spend some rehabilitation time
in the minor leagues. While he did look

solid in his 71 innings, you never know
how a full season will go with a rook-
ie. Whether or not Contreras can pro-
duce a solid season is anyone’s guess.
Vazquez — 27 years ‘old and in his
seventh season — could serve to be a
better acquisition for the Yankees than
Alex Rodriguez. Vazquez’s pitch arse-
nal and stats could easily be considered
the best on the rotation. He put up mag-
nificent numbers while playing for the
Montreal Expos. With run support,
Vazquez should be much better and
win more games, but his season will
come down to how he handles the pres-
sure of playing for the Yankees and
being in the New York spotlight.
Brown — 39 years old and in his
18th season — is coming off his first
full season since 2000. He has the abil-
ity to dominate, but the question
remains as to whether or not he can
complete the season injury-free. Even
if he reaches this goal, one could also
question if the‘ 39-year-old and often

injured pitcher can handle another 200-.

inning season. The strain of a full sea-
son on his near-40-year-old, previously
impaired arm could limit his effective-
ness on the mound.

Mussina — 35 years old and in his
15th season — could easily have the
success of the whole team riding on his

shoulders. He is the only starter who.

won’t have question marks over his
head come April. Mussina is the only
one of the five starters who has pitched
at least one full season for the Yankees
and fully understands the way they go
about everyday practices in New York.

With age, injury and lack of expe-
rience in New York all working against
them, the Yankees’ pitching staff will
need to step up in the 2004'season and
exceed expectations. Mussina will
need to anchor this staff, and if an
injury arises, owner George
Steinbrenner will have to make a huge
trade’ to bring in another starter. The
Yankees will have no time to waste,
given the pitching that Theo Epstein
added to his Red Sox club this off—sea-
son. - .
Based on possible problems alone,

_I say the Yanks will lose the division to

the Red Sox this year and could say
goodbye to the playoffs as well.

- opponent to

Panthers solve mystery of two—three zone in victory

    

_ Maybe Pitt’s 49-46 overtime
loss to Syracuse at the Petersen
Events Center on Sunday was just
what Pitt needed to get back on
track. ' 4 . .

Quite honestly, Pitt had not been
playing its best basketball for a few
games before last night. And getting

pbeaten in an arena where it had

never been beaten, by a team that is
not that great, can be humbling.

The Orangemen became the first
ever defeat the
Panthers at the Pete; Pitt shot itself
in the foot by
Orangemen. It was embarrassing on
Pitt’s part because Syracuse held
the Panthers under 50 points in 45
minutes of play and beat them at
their own game. Syracuse played
tough defense and slowed down the
tempo of the game, limiting Pitt’s
touches.

Most notably, the Panthers
struggled in the past few games
when it faced teams, such as Seton
Hall, Georgetown and Syracuse,
that employed a two—three zone.
Last night, the Panthers faced the
same daunting task when it played
at Providence — another team that

‘plays a two—three zone. If Pitt lost

to Providence, it could forget about
winning the Big East Conference or
the possibility of earning a No. 1
seed in the,NCAA Tournament.
With all of this at stake, the
Panthers had to stare their Achilles

heel — the two—three zone — in the “‘

face, so to speak. But somehow the

light finally clicked on. Pitt figured .

out how to revive its inside" game
that was lacking most recently
against inferior talent such as
Syracuse center Craig (Forth. ‘
Freshman center Chris Taft and

/junior forward Chevon Troutman

exploded for the Panthers; they
were the game’s leading scorers,
with 24 and 23 points, respectively.
Taft’s 24 ‘points were a career high.

Let’s face it; Pitt is not the greatest

shooting team from the field, so it
needs to ‘be able to beat up teams in
the paint.

For some unknown reason, this
was not possible against Syracuse,
but guard Carl Krauser, who had 22
points and eight assists, stepped up
last night and found a way to get the
job done against a top-15 team on

losing . to the _'

the road. Krauser’s play was critical
intthe No. 6 Panthers’ 88-61 victory
over No. 13 Providence. '

He was key because, when two
or three defenders blanketed him,
he was able to find another Panther,
who, quite naturally, was often wide
open for an easy bucket. Troutman
helped Krauser all night by sliding
behind 4 Providence’s zone.
Krauser’s court vision was on point
last night; on several occasions, he
was able to hit Troutman in the
paint with a pass for an easy layup.

Rather than committing an
offensive foul while attempting to

create space so he could drive to the
basket, Krauser let the chips fall

5 where they may. If he drove the

paint and‘ was fouled, fine.
Otherwise, he continued to the bas-
ket or dished off to another‘Panther
for an easy layup. ’

Even freshman guard Antonio
Graves got into the act, driving the
paint and drawing several
Providence defenders. But Graves
didn’t panic. He kept his head up
and found Taft for one of his many
slam-dunks of the night.

The Panthers could have lain
down and packed it in for the sea-

son after a devastating loss on
Sunday, but once again, they
showed resiliency. Pitt came out on
the road and arguably played its
best basketball game of the season,
and definitely its best game on the
road.

This win is a clear example that
the Panthers are one of the elite
teams in college basketball. They
just needed a swift kick in the
behind in-order to go back to play-
ing like it.

Freshman Taft leads all scorers with 24 points

Men’s Basketball, page 11

took what was, to that point, their biggest lead, 39-30,
only to have it erased by a three from Providence’s
Ryan Gomes. Gomes, the Friars’ leading scorer, was
held to only 11 points, and Donnie McGrath — their
second—leading scorer — was held toizero points by
Page.

_“It just keeps happening over and over again. Page
turns in great defensive performances each game,”
head coach Jamie Dixon said. “It’s toughness, desire
and willingness to do everything for the team.”

The lead just continued to grow for the Panthers as
they turned the game into a legitimate blowout.
Providence was unable to stop Troutman and Taft
underneath, let alone Krauser on the outside.

Troutman recorded 23 points to go along with
seven rebounds and four assists and Taft added a
game—high 24 points —- a career high —-— on 10-of-11
shooting, as well as six rebounds of his own.

“Even though I had a good game, scoring-wise, I
still have to improve and get ready for the next game,”
Taft said. ‘ ~

After fouling out of the last game, Krauser looked
to take things into his own hands down the stretch and
make sure Pitt came away with the win. He scored 22
points while dishing out eight assists. More impor-
tantly for Pitt, Krauser was 13 of 15 from the free-
throw line, and the team shot 28-of-31 on the night
from the charity stripe.

“Carl made some nice passes over the top, stepped
up to make the plays and hit his free throws near the
end,” Dixon said.

Pitt will now host Villanova at the Petersen Events
Center on Saturday in the team’s regular season ﬁnale

before heading to the Big East Tournament next week.

“We’ll be watching film tonight on Villanova and
doing all we can to get ready for that matchup on
Saturday,” said Dixon. “It just starts with the seniors.
They set the tone and attitude in practice, and it just
carries over. They have done it all night long.”

again, Moore controlled the ball and drove,
spun around a defender, and hit a jumper.

However, Villanova would score again to
make the Wildcat halftime lead 29-25. .

Stufﬂet started the second half by connect-
ing on a jump shot, and again,’ Pitt had cut the
Wildcat lead to two points. ’ .

But that would be as close as Pitt would
get, as Vil1anova’s slow-moving offense went
on a run to end the game. A,

The Wildcats used an offensive scheme
Where they use as much time on the clock as
they can before attempting a shot. Since there is

. no lO—second rule for women’s ‘collegiate bas-

ketball, Villanova sometimes took more than,10
seconds to cross the center-court line.

“We didn’t care that they were passing the
ball back and forth,” Berenato said, adding that
it did not frustrate her because, if the Wildcats
were continually passing, they were not scor-
mg.

Berenato was also pleased with many of the
final stats. She felt her team did a great job in
the turnover department, giving the ball up only

12 times, and she was proud that the Panthers A

held Villanova to a low shooting percentage —
43.5 percent. ‘ ‘ . .
“I thought’ we were very disciplined
tonight,” Berenato said. “I just want to thank
our ‘seniors for making the year really a joy.”
