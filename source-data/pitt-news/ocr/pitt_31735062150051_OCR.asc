the oi'ig’-.i'ial inzinuscript of his on-
ly opera. “l\‘lanr11,” first giveii in
Dresden 38 years ago this month.
The manuscript, which contains

832 pencilled pages of a conductor’s
score, with the words handwritten in

_German, was donated through Pad-

erewski’s manager, Sylwin Strak:-:cz,'
and Theodore A. Strazynski, presi-I
dent of the Polish Falcons.
DONOR ILL

Rufus Fitzgerald, University pro-
vost, and Dr. John Weber, University
secretary accepted the manuscript
for the University. Both Paderewski
and Chancellor John G. Bowman
were unable to attend the presenta-
tion as both were ill.

The opera follows an old gypsy
theme, telling of a gypsy girl who
marries and then is deserted by her
husband after a child is born. Event-
ually the girl kills herself. It was
ﬁrst presented on May 29, 1901, in
Dresden, and shortly after in Amer-
ica. Pittsburghers saw “Manru” at
the Duquesne garden before the
Mosque was built.

I Spring "Festival. _\Vee.k will hit its stride tomorrow evening when
Ithc ycar’s fourth Pitt Players’ show, “Our Town,” opens its two-
Iniglit stand in Stephen Foster Memorial at 8:30 o’clock.

FORRIER PREMIER

A former premier of post-war "Po-
land, the composer, who would not
talk on current affairs for publica-
tion, lashed out against presen condi-
tions, writing:

“In a deplorable epoch of mater-
ialism and of gloriﬁcation of brutal
force into which lately a large part
of the so-called civilized world has
been dragged by unscrupulous lead-
ers, in an epoch which builds altars
for low instincts of domination by
force, of supporting liberty and dem-
ocracy, the only possible reaction and

Qt China Toward Ideal Country

A
V

By Betty Larson I
“China is worl~:in.g toward an Ideal]
Nation,” said Kuan Han Sun grad-
uate student from China; “and com-
pared with European countries,I
America comes nearest to being that;
Ideal Nation.” I
Kuan Han Sun is attending theI
University on a fellowship fromI
Tsung I-Iau University, though he isI
a graduate of Chekiang university,I
Hang Chow. At Chekiang univer-I
sity lVlr. Sun majored in chemistry,I
and is now specializing in glass tech- »
nology; he intends to work in that:
ﬁeld when he returns to China. 
According to Mr. Sun, Chinese;
universities, which are similar in‘
many ways to our American colleges, I
are divided into two groups—Nation-
al and Private universities. The Na- 

 

tional university is the best and least ‘

expensive, and an entrance exam is
required; the Private university ap-
peals to the richer students who go
to school for a good time rather than
an education.

“The normal expenses for each col-
lege is about two hundred and ﬁfty
Chinese dollars, or about eighty
American dollars a year and that in-
cludes eVerything—-tuition, clothes,
and board,” said Mr. Sun. .

“Most of the Chinese universities
have been moved six hundred to one

thousand miles inland, as the univer- '
sity buildings have been bombed O1‘I

are now occupied by the Japanese.”

The Chinese army is even stronger
than before, so despite the fact that
the Japanese have seized large Chi-
nese cities, China is far from de-
feated. China started to build up a
national defense ﬁve years ago and
in the last ﬁve years China has
made much progress, due to the ef-
forts of Chiang-Ka-Shek, who has so
improved himself that he has gained
the respect of even his former ene-
mies, according to Mr. Sun.

(This is the last ‘in a series of ar-
ticles on the University’s art gallery).

By John Brosky

In our previous articles on the
University ﬁne arts gallery, we have
touched upon exhibitions and various
paintings; not only the ordinary
crafts of creating pictures on an
opaque surface in fresco, oil, and
water color, but also drawings that
represented the oulines of objects.

Notice, too. that a great part of
these painting were of Western Eu-
ropean art. How many of you, when
studying European paintings, thought
of them in connection with Oriental
Art?

We must remember that the an-
cient oriental art developed certain
phases of expression of ecclesiastical
nature which inﬂuenced Western art-
ists. Therefore, to understand Euro-
pean art, we should know something
of the art of the Far East. The orient-
al mind is signiﬁcant in itself as a
sourse of study and this we find re-
flected in their art.

With this in view, the ﬁne arts de-
partment added to its gallery repre-
sentations of oriental art in various
banners and sculptures. From India,
there are bronze ﬁgures of the six-
teenth to the nineteenth century. One
of these is a Siamese Buddha stand-
ing erect in a ﬂared skirt with his
hand pointed to the sky. The base
of the statue is of wood covered with
copper.

There is also a Tibetan bronze ﬁg-
urine with red eyebrows holding a
thunderbolt in its hand. It stands on
an oval base decorated with oval de-
signs and inscriptions. Another
piece of bronze work is a Siamese

More than that, it ssﬁhould provide 21 ploa.s;:mt ‘in-

in Pitt Win, 3-0

I-litting in the clutch and ﬁelding
spectacularly behind leithancler Andy
Johnson, sophomore curveballer, the
Panther nine opened the home sea-
son Friday with a surprise 3-0 win‘
over West Virginia’s supposedly base,
hit conscious outﬁt. ‘

In sharp conrast to the ineffectual
hiiriiiig exhibited by coach Mitter-
l:ing"s pitchers on the southern trip
was the southpaw "brilliance of J ohn—
son. The Mountaineers put men on
base in all but one inning, yet John-
son managed to come out of each
hole unscatlied with the aid of three
double plays.

Only five safeties zoomed off the
bats of the visitors while the Panthers
smacked eight. Five of the Pitt
blows were bunched in the two scor-
ing iiinings, the i’:'ourth and ﬁfth.

out, Hairtman send Goelz to third
with a double, but Johnson grounded
out.

lialf of the fiiftli and after Keiper had
rolled out, Straloski scored Butch
with his third hit, a double. At this
point, Nachbar replaced Nebera. on

day.

more safeties. Enough said:

-SAM almost tumbled out of ﬁrst
place on Wednesday,  Theta Chi’s
fugitives from a football practice bat-

‘V

 
 

tied to the seventh inning before giv- 1

ing way 4;-3. ‘

Sammy slugger Labowitz came out!

g:-idders Jones and Fitchko as he_
crossed the plate in the seventh!
lyab came out of the melee with a cut
le_.s_=,', the winning run, and the rare
pleasure of seeing future All-Amer-
ican Eddie Jones sprawled in the dirt.
Paging Mr. Bowser!
MENDLOW WINS AGAIN

in Thursday’s win, SAM blasted
the oft-repeated crack, “When you-
play the Sainmies, you play Mend-l
low” with a 13-1 triumph. Delta’
Tau Delta (remember them, they
stopped I-lanclsome Bob Dannies) was
i'i'i.e victim of a 9 l.‘Lll1 inning which
proviiled the winner with a chance to
retire Lew Mencllow after the third
and finish up with Artie Hurwitz.

Phi Epsilon Pi came through withi
a couple of hairline decisions. On‘
Wednesday, the Phi Eps outslugged
Phi Kappa, 16-15. Wechsler had four
hits, while Larry P.osenson’s three
siifeties included a home run. Phi
Kap‘s Davidson and Connell account-
ed for six hits and seven runs be-

01'
tween them, one of Davidson’s swats
being a fou:'—bagger. A six run Phi
Kappa rally in the ﬁnal round fell
just short.

Thursday’s Phi Ep win was a little
saner, but no easier. The winners
scored four in the second, but had to
go an extra inning to cop the 6-5 de-
cision.

LAMH'DA CHIS WIN

Lambda Chi Alpha also scored
two victories. Tuesday, the Lambda
Chis cutswatted Theta Chi, 10-8, and
two days later they squashed Phi
Kappa, 20-7. Fumbleitis ruined the
Phi Kaps; in fact the whole box score

‘looks like a comedy of errors.

In thei" win over Theta Chi. the
Lambda Chi’s punched out eight runs
in the last two innings to turn de-
feat into victory.

Phi Gamma Delta Quick pitched
his team to an 11-0 win over Sigma
Alpha Epsilon. Only two men reach-
ed first on the Fiji twirler as he

turned in his most impressive per-.

forrnance to date.

Sp.i'ii1g Festival \Veek will have
an oiitstaiiding })l"0g'.l"2llll of ath-
letics for sp0rts—iiiiii(‘le(.l Slll(l€lllS.

Head coach Ralph Mitterling will
be showing off his diamond outﬁt at
home ‘for the last time this season
when he sends it against Penn State
tomorrow and Wednesday. The
Panthers, rested from a two-game
series with West Virginia, are ex-
pected to give the experienced Stat-
ers a stiff ﬁght and with a little pitch-
1Zii..,f::‘. could win both matches.
JAMBOREE TOMORROW’

Prior to tomorrow’s game, Director
James Potts and the Intramural De-
' partment of the University will pre-
sent an event unique at Pitt, the
Sports Jamboree. Promptly at 2:30
o'clock, after the two baseball teams
have ﬁnished batting drills, at least
a hundred boys will set up equip-
ment and take part in 13 different
sports.

Nearly all of the boys are mem-
bcrs of intrrimural championship
teams and, so far as possible, will
deinonstrate the sport in which
they are titleholders. The idea of
the Jamboree, which will last a half
hour, is to acquaint the student body
with the individual sports and with
the activities of the intramural pro-
gram.

Action will be taking
throughout the entire half hour
while an announcer describes and
comments brieﬂy on the history of
each sport. Included in the Jamboree
will be archery, badminton, tennis,
table tennis, fencing. volleyball, soc-
cer, life saving, gymnastics, squash,
horseshoes, and golf.

Fielding practice will follow the
Jamboree and the game should begin
,by 3:10. State. with ﬁve veterans in
the lineup, will start a team that has
been up and down all season but
which has shown a fair amount of
batting punch.

lPanthers Try for lniitial Home '
Win Against Ohio State Netmen

Pitt’s tennis team goes after its?

lPa11ther Golfers Play

‘first home win of the season tomor-
row when Ohio State’s netinen play
the Panthers at 2:30 on the Trees
Gym courts.

The lineup which is to meet the
boys from Columbus, Ohio, is doubt-
ful. Joe Kristufek, in spite of his
loss of form last week, is certain to
be at No. 1. Adrian Hartman will
chop them from his customary No. 2
spot, and Francis Harmuth will be at
No. 3. Filling the No. 4 position will
be Byron McLaughlin, but No. 5 and
No. 6 positions are undecided.

Bob Burns, Carl Kaufman, Ed
Goehring, and Al Barry have been
playing a series of practice matches
to determine which man will face
Ohio State.

This afternoon at 2:30 the fresh-
man netters invade Schenley Park to
engage the Carnegie Tech plebes.
The Pitt yearlings are an unknown
quantity as yet, since this afternoon’s
duel is the inaugural match of the

current season for the frosh.

T0day’s match with Tech should
give a line on what to expect from
the first-year squad. Bob -Nicksin,
Phillip Lynch, Stanley Unger, Dave.
Ganger are men who are certain to
joust for the Panthers. Changes
may be made in the lineup for the
match with Penn State’s frosh net-
ters a week from today, depending
on what the freshman do against
Tech. I

‘Story’ Editor Outlines Qualities

Necessary in Writing Profession
D

Speaking in a very informal man-
ner, Whit Burnett,'editor and found-
er of the Magazine Story, discussed
“The Self Education of a Writer” be-
fore a large audience in Stephen Fos-
ter Memorial last Friday. At ﬁrst
Mr. Burnett felt handicapped by a
tremendous pile of notes he had com-
piled on his trip from New York, but
he soon dispensed with them and
simply talked.

“A writer should see, hear, and re-
member. He should feel emotion and
have a sense of communication,” said
Mr. Burnett. He then suggested that
a writer should not dash down his
first idea, but should submit it to in-
tensive scrutiny and reﬂection.

Mr. Burnett considers the natural
equipment of a writer to consist of;
imagination, audacity. and a perse-
verance in sending his story out until
it is published. “To write well,” he?
continued, “an author should havei
personality and talent. Many writers ,
just have talent, and I’m afraid;
they’re rather dull.” '
SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE

Like many editors, Mr. Burnett
has found that most of the material
submitted to him contains a new de-
velopment in fiction, social signiﬁ-
cance. Today’s material is diﬁerent
from the passe revolt against prudery
and prohibition that raged in the
twenties. He believes that the de-
pression has brought out a feeling of
responsibility on the part of writers.
They now look at the scene with ob-
jective eyes to bring out some
.meaning.

,“The general run of college men
and women do not have the encrust-
ed sentimentality of the previous
generation,” said Mr. Burnett. “They
possess a greater degree of urbanity
and clearsightedness.” 1

He spoke at some length of his
friend, William Saroyan, today’s fair-
haired boy of letters. While working
as messenger boy for the Postal.
Telegraph, Saroyan wrote in his!
spare time, and bombarded Story!
magazine with his manuscripts until‘
they accepted over 30 of his stories.‘
FIRST TO PUBLISH

“Story was the first to publish Sar- ’
oyan, Jesse Stewart, and Eric Knight,
author of ‘The Flying Yorkshire-
man,’ proudly stated Mr. Burnett. “I
should say that 90 per cent of our

speech, Mr. Burnett went on to am-;
plify this last statement. He explain-
ed that about ten years ago, all the
literary magazines were under the
inﬂuence of H. L. Menken, in that!
they featured journalistic articles
rather. than fiction. At that time,
short story writers could not get their
material printed.

PUBLISHED IN VIENNA

Having had the same experience
Burnett decided to do something
about it. In March, 1921, he and his
wife published the first issue of Story
in Vienna. At that time it was only
a mimeographed magazine, but they
soon found themselves flooded by
material from America.

“Our purpose was to look at the
American scene through the eyes of
younger creative writers,” added Mr.
Burnett. In fact, the average age of
our contributors is under 30.” He
went on to say that the only reason
they publish the older, already suc-
cessful writers is to add prestige to
the younger ones.

When asked what qualiﬁcations
were expected by the editors of
Story, he replied, “We have no set
rules. All we ask is that it be an
honest story and have an artistic
quality that sets it apart.”

(Continued from Page One)

sordid fumes of a perverted propa-
ganda, if morally strong enough to
salvation is deem.ed to come from the
younger generations.

Paderewski was invited, in 1937, to
become a member of the University
faculty, Chancellor Bowman reveal-
ed last Thursday. In October, 1937,
Bowman wrote to the virtuoso, say-
ing “You would be a philosopher
with us . . . We should like to have
you tell us what you have tried to
do and how, out of your own expe-
rience, what it is that people need in
order to get along in a happy way
with one another and to ﬁnd life sat- ,
isfying.

“In the last ten years we have
tried to build an idea of courage and
of spirituality into our buildings. We
have tried to express by the stones
of our buildings the spirit of what
ought to be in the lives of those about
a university. We should like to have
you come llere and help us to inter- .
pret further how to live great life.”

Mr. Paderewski, then ill in Paris,
cabled his reply to Chancellor Bow-
man: “Illness made impossible offer
you my earnest thanks for charming
letter and honor of your invitation.
Same reason deprives me of great
joy of accepting your tempting prop-
osition. Idea of lecturing in your
glorious university, of getting in
touch with your faculty and Amer-
ican youth, appeals to me more than
words can describe. May I be per-
mitted express you and faculty deep-
est regrets assure you of profound
gratitude and offer vou my very high
regards.-—Paderewski.

Colleges Offer
Special Classes -
On Marital Life

CHAPEL HILL, N. C.—(ACP)———
Training of college and university
students for married life is growing
by leaps and bounds, it was disclosed
at a special University of North Car-
olina marriage institute here.

Since last year, more than 60 col-
leges have been added to the list of
214 who early established instruc-
tion in marital relations.

Speaking in favor of continued ex-
pansion in this form of education,
Dr. Ernest R. Groves, of North Car-
olina university said, “It is a dis-
grace to allow young people to go out
into the world so unprepared and
unequipped to deal with the elemen-
tary problems of human existence.”

Dr. Groves founded the ﬁrst cred- 3
it course on marriage in the country.

A committee of the conference set

up the following qualiﬁcations in the .
3 selection of marriage teachers: “Hon—
' esty of purpose, ability to handle day

by day problems with balance and
perspective; in other words, common
sense, and a depth and breadth of
understanding that inspires
dence.”

head of the sixteenth century.

Because of the diﬁiculty of enter-
ing India, art painings of Tibet have
been unknown until recent years. A
large Tibetan banner, the Pantheon
of Deities, hangs in the office of Mr.

Walter R. I-lovey, associate professor
of ﬁne arts. .
Included in the oriental art col-
lection are two funerial urns from
China given by Thyrsa Amos, Dean
of Women at the University. While
visiting China a friend of Miss Amos
obtained the urns from excavating
workmen who opened a
grave which held the urns.
An interesting erample of Chinese
pottery is a roof tile, a grotesque ﬁg-
ure which the Chinese people used to
adorn the roofs of their houses to
frighten away evil spirits or bring
good luck. The tile is Torquoise
glaze with a teak wood base.
i Arousing great interest in oriental
art was the exh:ibi<'.'ion and lecture of
D:. Eileen Macfarlane last December
when she gave impressions of India
by using religious banners from T1-
bet. The sculptures and bronze work
are of great aid to the Ceramics
1 classes.
It was a realization of this art that
prompted Dr. John G. Bowman,
Chancellor, to loan part of his re-
,markable collection of ceramics to
gthe fine arts department. The dis-
play, which is shown in the exhibi-
tion gallery on the thirtieth ﬂoor,
consists largely of oriental wares of
,the Sung and Ming periods. Partic-
 ularly ﬁne are two black glaze bowls
golf Temoku ware.
, These tea bowls of the Sung pe-
;riod later inﬂuenced the design of
 famous Japanese bowls used in their
itea ceremony. They are ﬁne exam-
ples of exquisitly fragile porcelains
of the time of Chun Ling.
