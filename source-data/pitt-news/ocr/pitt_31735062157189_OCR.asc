Second Writing
Booklet, MSS,
Ready May 13

A magazine of the best in stu-
dent creative writing, “MSS,” will
be sold May 13 and 14 to the stu-
dent body as well as to represen-
tatives of district colleges and high
schools attending the third annual
Western Pennsylvania Conference
for Writers.

Priced at 25 cents, the magazine
replaces “Student Writing,” a pub_-
lication of a similar nature which
appeared at the Conference last
spring.

Dr. Edwin L. Peterson, short
story teacher and director of the
Conference, selected the short sto-
ries, sketches, essays and poetry
which appear in the magazine
from material submitted to Pitt
creative writing teachers.

Among the short stories is
“Never Tell” which won senior
Pat Eldridge honorable mention in
the recent “Atlantic Monthly” con-
test for student writers.

In “Steve Magarac" Penn Burke
has investigated the myth of the
Paul Bunyon of the steel mills and
made the monster of the open
hearths as provocative as his
northwoods counterpart.

Veterans’ memories, a popular

feature of last year’s magazine,

ﬁnd literary expression again in
ﬁve vivid sketches including one
by John Golightly, sports editor
of the News, and another by Ber-
n'ieyFischman, former ﬁction edit-
or of the Panther. .

“Cancas Mask” by George Dix-
on is‘ a story of wartime India;
“The Lincoln Room" by Alice Fox,
an interesting variation of the tra-
ditional American success theme;
while “The Beseiged” by Terre
Rios is a tale based on the exotic
mores of West Indian islanders.

Fixepoems have also been in-
cluded in the magazine as well as
an abstruse essay, “Air Condition.-
ed Nightmare" by Harry Schwalb.
which considers the current phi-
losophical trends in metropolitan
writers.

Notice Veterans
Saturday, May 22, 1948 will

be the last day Veteran stu-

dents will be permitted to re-

quisition supplies on their

at Belleﬁeld Avenue and ending
at Ellsworth center; the evening’s
Carnival at Ellsworth Center; and

Schenley Hotel oﬁicials are
cracking down on parking in the
hotel driveways by non-patrons.
In an announcement. today they
reported that such parking is not

The action makes the hotel
driveways out of bounds to stu-
dents in the habit of parking there.
Both management and patrons
have been so annoyed in the past
that the police will be called in
whenever it can be proved that a
parked car is not the property of

which, over the course of a full
college program, could entitle the
individual to at least one and pos-
sibly two extra semesters of VA
beneﬁts.

Ricarfs oﬁice, 8001 CL. will be
open May 5, 6 and 7 for anyone
interested in postponing his leave

should see Mr. Lange and ﬁle
necessary papers in his oﬂice.

Most students already used 15
days of their accumulated leave
between the fall and spring sem-
esters. The June subsistence
checks will include payment for
the period from June 5, last day

; The deal Ricart. Pitt's VA mouthpiece, has is this: By ﬁling a
special form with his oﬂice. an'O~- 
eX_GI can gain 30 fun davS'0fxo1' the semester, to. June 20. un-

less the cancellation form is filed
next week.

Under VA policy, if a veteran
has suﬂicient time entitlement to
extend one day beyond half a
semester, he will receive full tui-
tion, book requisition and full sub-
sistence. Thus, by gaining thirty
days each year, it is conceivable
that a student could gain two ex-
tra semesters of beneﬁts.

Students planning to attend an-
other school during the summer
under GI grants must ﬁle a re-
quest for a Supplemental Certiﬁ-
cate of Eligibility in Ricart’s of-
ﬁce on May 5, 6 and 7. Any delay
in signing this request will cause
added delay in obtaining summer
subsistence at other schools.

 

 

  

z aaea—-am ‘o9‘n1dV‘&epiI.r —-sMaN J.-Lu an

S0 \Vl1at :>  
Congress electionvof a iweek ago proves

again that the ordinary ‘student is not interest-
ed in Student Governing affairs. In fact, his

lack of interest is devastating.

Many reasons have been givensince last
week in an elfort to explain the lack of re-
sponse of male voters. Amongthe-n1 were the
relocation of the voting machines on theeighth
ﬂoor; the long li.ne at voting; the presidentital
year; ad inﬁnitum. All these are interesting,
and that’s the extent of their validity.

Closer to the fact is that reason propoundedl

by Arp Chontos, our Exchange editor, “when
he wrote that the business of student govern-

ment is entirely too small to rate any deﬁnite
attention. iThere’s little place in the lives of a

scholar and a citizen to consider the importance

of recognizing the Chess Club. 'l‘here’s little‘

enough time for him to fulﬁll the other duties
of his life.
Student Government has its place, we sup-

ppose, but only in the lives of office seekers

and their friends. And, it seems, in the minds
of the Students for Wallace. To a student with

no irons in the ﬁre—-the great majority of col-
lege students here and throughout the ‘country
-—-—student government merits a disgusted “so
what.”

  P All-(Int Festival

Next week is Spring Festival Wieek. ‘Be-

4:

‘ginning Monday afternoon, and proceeding
through ﬁve full days, the Pitt social world

is treated to a full week of fun. .
Almost every year, the Pitt News goes all
out to promote Spring Festival. This year is
no exception. John McMorris and Len Matc-
nak, big shots in the Festival this year, have

i tried to“ pull one out of the hatf In fact, they

, Frank E. Davis.

have gone so far into the “good time” idea,

that their budget calls for a considerable loss.

If feature spots can be called in the Festival
calendar, one might point at therally on Mon-
day; the carnival on Tuesday and «Wednesday ;
the Band Concert, Tuesday evening; Pitt Play-

”ers,'Thursday and Saturday evenings; and the

main. Ball; of A Nations, Friday evening, at
Ches Arena. All of these, along with the rest of

the affairs, should provide a full‘ measure‘ of

enjoyment. _

The Festival is well worth the price of a
strip ticket,‘ for a’ change.‘ Considering the
“'red’-’ ledger books, the strip tickett doesn’t cov-
er the amount of entertainment provided. This
year’s Festival is tops. '

Wheel's Evoliuﬁoni‘

Big       
Wheel

Ever since the dawn of history (we accept this
statement on authority——actually no one knows
what time of day history began) wheels have ﬁg-T
ured prominently in the affairs of men.

/There have been big wheels, little wheels,
medium-sized wheels, and various and assorted
graduated sizes in between. The multiplicity
of wheels extant today notwithstanding, there
was a. time when to be a wheel was just all
that mattered in this woebegone wcrld. And the
wheel backthen was not the polished, smooth-
functioning, worldly-Wise wheel of today.
You know, what it was? A log with the edges;
knocked off.

How the edges came to be knocked off this par-
ticular log is again not certainly known. Conjec-
ture has it (he .wrote the standard college text on
the subject: “Free-wheeling and Log—rolling Down
the Ages”) that some exceptionally gifted young
cave man did the deed when roused to a frenzy
of activity. What stirred the usually . phlegmatic
refugee-from—a-hole-in-a-hill to this sudden burst
of initiative is-still a matter for conjecture (what
can you do—-—the guy’s ‘an authority on this sort
of drivel). Speculation has it that the bright lad
was wending his weary way homeward one even-
tide, pulling behind him a particularly well-en-
dowed. young cave woman when the Wench, play-
ing hard to get as, wenches are wont to do even
at the early date, began to drag‘ her feet.

Young Cro-Magnon was not a. little bit ir-
ritated at this display of untoward behavior
by his "chosen one. Grabbing the nearest. sap-
ling, he stripped it of its rough outer bark (ob-
viously, this did not take place in that area?
now referred to by the publishe_r’s guild as
. B_oston-Bless,It) , and with his crude stone knife
lopped oil’; the offending corners. l .

He then proceeded to hollow it out. Finally,
slipping a reed rope through it and tying same
around the aforementioned young cave woman’s
adequate though no doubt shapely calves he rolled
her on home. '

The practice caught on-—and has continued
right down to this highly enlightened‘ day and
age. Of course, there have been a. few minor
changes and improvements in the wheel. over
a period of time(» smething to do with carts,
wagons, and automobiles, I believe), but basi-‘

. cally a. wheel‘ is still just that—-at wheel.

Today, as in times gone by, ‘the wheel is char-
acterized essentially by the ease with-« which it

wheel-woman relationship has changed but little
from primitive days: women still go readily for a

mittee, headed by Jim Duchene.

Duchene said that his committee found the present trouble to
be due to (1) ‘people not knowing where to go for publicity (2) poor
supervision of publicity facilities, and (3) poor facilities. ‘

His committee recommended that new bulletin boards be posted
by the Student Desk and in other strategic spots. The elevators and
the Tuck Shops would also be ideal places for posters, according

to Duchene. 9

A bright new idea is td have
booklets on what is going on at
Pitt each week published for dis-
tribution each ‘Monday. It was
suggested that freshmen from ori-
entation courses interested in
journalism could do the writing
and acquire experience.

Priority for space on the bul-
letin boards is also provided for.
A Student Congress committee of
representatives from Student Art
Guild, publications and other

are to be responsible for adminis-
tering thelplan.

Brad Hunt to Style 

 

Hospitality Hop Music

Brad Hunt, with his Mega MutediMusic, will set the tempo for
the Hospitality Hop, Wednesday, May 5, from 3 to 5:30 13- m- in

Syria Mosque.

Mega Muted Music is Hunt's own style derived from Clarinets,

played into megaphones, with muted basses for mellowness. The
band began thirteen years ago with three boys of ﬁfteen and is
now one of Pittsburgh’s leading orchestras.

Hunt's slow, sweet music has furnished the background for many
high school and college dances, and at the Vogue Terrace, and Schen-

ley Hotel. .

Blending with Brad Hunt’s music will be gaily-decorated booths

set up by the 15 Pittisororities andé
the Pitt Independent" Association.

The booths, in keeping with the
Spring Festival theme of “Na-
tions,” will serve refreshments
typical of the untr which they

represent. The.waitresses at the
booths will also dress in symbolic
costumes.

Three prizes will be awarded
the most original booths by votes
submitted by those attending the
dance. Ballots are printed on the
tickets which may be purchased

from the Student Desk or mem-
bers of the ticket committee for
65 cents. If, however, tickets are
bought on a strip, one ticket will
cost 50 cents. _

Bob Silberstein, chairman of the
dance, announces that a wel:l-
known guest star will be intro-
duced during the intermission.
Other_ members of the committee

are: Joe Wolfe, business manager,

Jeanne Ann Coyle, publicity chair-
man; Rosalind Harris, ticket chair-
man; and Adelyn Letwin, decora-
tions chairman. ‘

Harvard Collects
Poetry Recordings

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (IP)
Convinced that poetry has to be
heard to be appreciated, a Harv-
ard professor has amassed an un-
uhual collection of phonograph
records.

Prof. Frederick C. Parkard, who
teaches public speaking, records
the voice of famous poets, au-
thors and actors. His collection is
housed in a special library.

The idea was born by accident
when T. S. Eliot visited Pack-
ard’s study in 1933. Packard
showed him, a new recording de-
vice and persuaded him to test it
out‘ by reading his “Hollow Men.”

The World Student Service Fund, an American agency for World‘
Student relief, was established in 1937 by the National Intercol-

Service Fund, since its purpose was raising money to aid students in

war-torn China. 9

When the second World War
broke out in Europe, the organ-

phases in the program -— aid in
food, aid in providing shelter, aid
in medical care. aid inbooks and

The WSSF is unique in that it
is a relief organization of the stu-

Awaits Wayne
Track Team

By Bob Van Atta

Offthe ﬁne form they displayed
in the recent Penn Relays, the
surprising Panther track squad
may prove a discourteous host to
Vlfayne University of Detroit to-
morrow afternoon at Pitt Stadium.
The meet starts at 1:15 p.m.

Pitt’s Herb Douglas and Wayne’s
Lorenzo» Wright are expected to
furnish most of ,the individual
thrills. Both are former All-Am—.
erican broad jumpers and highly-
rated Olympic prospects for that
event.

Pitt Surprised East

Carl O1son’s strong array of
hurdlers demonstrated top form
in winning the Penn shuttle hur-
dlers relay crown. Bill Raney, high
hurdling ace, is undefeated in dual
meet competition but is getting
strong competition fromteammate
Evan Kisick. ’ ’

Clarence Doak is one of the
leading low hurdles men, in the
Eastern section of the United
States. .

The Panthers surprised Eastern
Seaboard sports writers with their
showing in the Penn Relays. The
quarter—mile , and half—mile relay
teams ﬁnished a surprising second,

of NYU in a trial heat the shock
of the meet.

Ex-Panther Starred

Douglas ﬁnished s e c o n d to
Wright in the broad jump, and in
addition captured fourth place in
the 100-yard dash.

Former Pitt star Bill Carter,
competing with a troupe of Army
Olympic aspirants from Lackland
Army Air Base, was one of the
outstanding performers in the
Philadelphia extravaganza.

. The opening meet at the Sta-
dium ten days ago found the Pan-
ther Ithinélads recording their
highest point total in 14 years,
swamping Ohio University, 107-24.

Perhaps the secret to the three

is that the linksmen have been

limited to one ball a match. This

stirred up considerable resentment V

in Morgantown a few weeks ago.

IKA Routs Phi Eps;
Larson Gives One‘Hit

On the strength of a one-hit pitching performance by Corky Lar-
.sen, PiKA upended the Phi Eps at Ellsworth ﬁeld Monday, 4-1-
In going the distance, Larsen struck out twelve and walked only
two.
Lone man to hit safely for the losers was second’ baseman Bert
Klein. Klein dropped a texas-league single into center ﬁeld in the
fourth inning, to score Dick Seewald with the Phi Eps’ sole tally.

After scoring once in the second on Ike Icardi’s‘ home run and
again in the third on a two-base errors, the PiKA’s put the game on

ice in the sixth frame .

Icardi started things off by drawing his second base-on-balls.

Don Wilde looked at four bad¢

ones; then Sonny Manella came
through with a sharp single to
center, scoring lcardi.

On the throw to the plate, Wilde
took third and Manella second.
George Hawker, batting for How-
die Kuhns, lifted to right.

Tagging up after the catch,
Wilde streaked for home and
made it. But he slid into catcher
Jack Pincus, knogkiiig him over.

I 'Manel1a,.seei'ng Pincus on his
back and the ball rolling away,

tried for the plate. He almost scor-
ed but Bruce Gilbert, who had re-
lieved Phi Ep starting hurler Mark

’ Chernoff. backed up the play and

tagged him for the third out.
In the other fraternity contest

Independents:  

Upsurge Fails
By Lynn iMitcl1ell
An underdog Pitt Indepen-
dent team buffaloed the Mam-
mals, runners-up to PiKA in
last year ’s softball play—off, for
six innings before losing, 4-3, at
Trees Field last Thursday.

In a weird seventh frame both
teams loaded the bases after six
innings of tie ball. The Independ-

ents pushed over one run to .

break the deadlock in the upper
half, but Ted Yennello’s smash

over third in the last half sent 
over the tying _and winning run 

for the Mammals.
Yennello’s hit was disputed by

the losers, but Leo Bemis, subbing ,
as “ump,” was not one to change 
his decision. Bill O'Brien was the 
winning pitcher and Sam Velmer 
‘the loser. ‘

Higher up on the hill the Phi
Gams and DTD’s were lucky to
play. One of the local residents,

irked by the foul ball and wild ,
throw artists, threatened to call 

the cops. She was ﬁnally paciﬁed.
The Gams won the delayed tilt,
7-4. .

In a third game at Trees Kirk
Johnson threw hitless ball for six
innings to pitch the Dynamos to
their ﬁrst win, downing the Cassa-
grandes, 13-4. Bob Rapp was
slapped with the loss.

Frank Susko, formerly a. left-
ﬁelder, was brought into third
base because Dodo Canterna’s
English class will not permit him
to show up until the third or
fourth inning of home games.

Mitterling installed Jackie Sny-
der in left ﬁeld in place of Susko.

Snyder had been ﬁelding too un-

steadily at shortstop and second
base. Jack Smodic continues in
center, while Frank Couch pa-
trols right.
