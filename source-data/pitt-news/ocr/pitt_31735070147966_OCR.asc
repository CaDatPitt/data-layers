research funds

Mallory Grossman
News Editor

Heinz Endowments will no longer
fund Marcellus Shale gas drilling
research at Pitt because the school
focused too much on research and
not enough on advocacy.

The University will continue to
research the public health impact
surrounding Marcellus Shale gas
drilling, but Pitt will no longer run
programs such as FracTracker.org,
an online tool collecting data on the
drilling. .

Heinz Endowments previously
funded the FracTracker database at
Pitt with an $1,800,000 grant. The
foundation is currently seeking a new
place to run its programs.

The foundation supports projects

that aim to improve quality of life in. y

the Pittsburgh region, and focuses
on ﬁve disciplines which are rep-
resented by their grant programs:
arts and culture, children, youth and
families, education, environment and
innovation economy, according to
their web site. '

The withdrawn funding marks an
end to, one of the most proliﬁc proj-
ects for the Center for Healthy Envi-
ronments 8z‘Communities (CHEC),
part of the Graduate School of Public
Health. The center has also had two
directors in the past year, and the
position is currently vacant.

Despite withdrawal of ﬁmding for
the programs, Allison Schlesinger,
a spokeswoman for Pitt’s‘ Graduate
School of Public Health, said Pittwill
continue to do research around Mar-
cellus Shale drilling.

’ “We will continue to do that re-
search, they’re just not funding it,”
Schlesinger said.

Heinz Endowment officials were '

not immediately available for com-
ment. ‘, . , ,
Despite the removal of research
programs, Schlesinger said that
CHEC is still grateﬁil for the ﬁinding
from the endowments for its other

- programs. She said GSPH and Heinz

Endowments will “continue to work
together to ﬁnd a permanent home
for FracTracker.org and to establish
joint research priorities.”

Heinz Endowments founded
CHEC in 2004 under a grant, and
it will continue to fund multiple re-
search programs at the center on air
quality, water quality and other public
healthissues that impact southwest-
ern Pennsylvania, Schlesinger said.

Schlesinger said Heinz Endow-
ments will no longer fund Marcel-
lus Shale research programs at Pitt
because the center favors research
over advocacy.

She said Heinz Endowments of-

ﬁcials feel CHEC is not doing enough
community outreach and advocacy
based on the research.

“CHEC has become uncomfort-

able with outreac ,” Schlesinger said.
“We are a University research center,
of course we favor research. That’s
what we’re supposed to do.”

Schlesinger said that while the
school d0esn’t oppose advocacy and
outreach, its primary job is research.
She said advocacy and outreach must
be research-based.

, The same issue of research versus
advocacy caused former director of
the center, Dr. Conrad “Dan” Volz_]r.,
to resign in April. His successor and

~ former dean of GSPH, Dr.,Bernard

Goldstein, also recently resigned

Incessant rain may bring ﬂoods

Tegan Hanlon,

Assistant News Editor

Looming rain clouds gave way to
steady showers «throughout the
day Tuesday, requiring students
to evade puddles on their way to
their ﬁrst post-Lab.or Day,classes
and brings caution about ﬂooding
to the area. ’

With Tropical Storm Lee stalled
along the Appalachians in Penn-
sylvania and West Virginia and
promising only more rain through
Sunday, the National ‘Weather
Service issued-a ﬂood advisory

Tuesday morning through Friday
afternoon for the Ohio River near
Pittsburgh.‘ '
‘ Lee’s remnants will bring be-
tweenl1.4 and four inches of rain-
fall to the Pittsburgh area in the
next two days. ‘

For Pitt students, the advi-
sory means packing an umbrella
through Sunday and avoiding low
spots prone to ﬂooding.

The National Weather Service’s
web site said that the Ohio River
is expected to rise above 18,feet
Wednesday afternoon,‘ ﬂooding

the Monongahela River Parking '

Wharf downtown. ,
If rainfall is heavier than ex-

pected and the river reaches 22
feet, the ﬂooding will reach the
10th Street Bypass, according to
the National Weather Service.
PennDOT has also taken notice
of the weather pattern encompass-

ing most of Pennsylvania, urging '

motorists to use their headlights
and common sense when driving
in rain.

“Motorists should never at-
tempt to drive over ﬂooded road-

ways,” Scott Christie, PennDOT

Deputy Secretary for Highway.
Administration, said in a press
release sent out Tuesday. “Flood-

‘ waters are usually much deeper

than they appear.” 3

The Pitt News reported in April that Volz_

it came to Marcellus Shale drilling.

The former Pitt professor is an open critic

University was not allowing him to openly voice
his dissent, so he left of his own accord.

In the month prior to his resignation, Volzv

Ifyou’re awoman, there’s aboutaso percent chance
you’re protected against HPV and some types of
cancer. Ifyou’re a man, well, there’s a very small
chance you are. ‘

HPVA the human papillomavirus, is the most
common sexuallytransmitted infection. Itisknown
for its ability to cause certain cancers, most com-
monly cervical cancer, and 50 percent of sexually
active people will get it in their lives.

Fortunately, modern medicine can prevent
some ofthenastyconsequences ofHPV.According
to research conducted by the Center for Disease
Control, fewer than halfof the teenage girls in the
study had received at leasttheﬁrstoutofthre'e shots
required for the vaccination. Less than one-third
had received the full series. And rates for teenage
boys were negligible.

Given that the U.S. Department of Health and .

Human Services’ new prevention guidelines will
makeinsurance coverseveralwornenis preventative
services next year, we_ think students should take
advantages of the health options they have.

The entire series of shots costs around $400
butis coveredbysome insurance plans. Although
that is a lot of money to most students, lifetime
healthcare costs forHPVmake itthe second most
expensive S'I'I after HIV. Failing to protect our-
selves is costly bothto our health and ourwallets.
Pitt’s Student Health Service offers the vaccine
through its pharmacy for students with outside
health insurance. .

Financial help isn’t unheard of; either. Students
who are 18 years old or younger can qualify for
tree vaccinations at the Allegheny County Health
Department’s Oakland branch through the Vac-
cines for Children plan. Uninsured students might
qualifyforforthe Merckvaccine Pat1_'entAssistance

The vaccine isn’t as effective if one has already
been exposed to the virus, so it’s important to get
it as early as possible.

Pitt’s alcohol poli

Matt Schaff
Columnist

Most Pitt students would rather party than dis-
cuss the causes of the Great Recession.

Be it because of the painful delay the de-
pressed job market threatens to impose on
their career prospects or the general failure .
of D.C. politiciansto communicate economic
reality, people on campus tend to steer away
from econo-talk. Instead, they like totalkabout
alcohol. _ g n _

- Despitewhatyoumightassume,thetvvotop—
ies don’t have to be irnutually exclusive. Infact, if
you try to compare one aspect of the recession
story —— subprime lending'%1'to one currently
relevant aspect of alcohol on campus-— under-
age drinking — the similarities are striking.
What’s more, such a comparison shows how
inadequate Pitt’s alcohol amnesty policy, even
in its revised form, really is. »

It’s all about risky behavior, the environment
that fails to prevent that behavior and the safety
net that minimizes the human cost once the
gambling goes sour. These three characteristics

apply to both the stories of underage drinking ‘
on campus and pre-recession subprime lending.‘ I

Let’s delve deeper. ‘ V
In the 1980s, the Depository Institution De

regulation and Monetary Control and Garn-St.
Germain Depository Institutions acts lifted the
federally imposed caps on mortgage interest
rates and allowed individuals to ﬁnance home-
buyingwith much smaller down payments. This
builtthe environmentthatallowedlendingﬁrrns

toindulgeinariskybehavior:peddlingsubprime ‘

mortgages.

Subprime mortgages are home loans of-
fered to low- and rniddle—income buyers whose
questionable ability to pay bills would normally
disqualify them for traditional loans. Because

. of their high risk, subprime loans often come

with higher — or “adjustable” —— interest rates.
The growth in popularity of mortgage-backed
securities — bundles of these subprime and
more traditional loans that are traded in shares

— and the historically low post—9/11 interest
rates ﬁieled a surge in subprime lending —- and
with it, an explosion of housing development
and prices. ‘ . ' _ V

But when interest rates ﬁnally rose, the hous-
ingbubble burst and lower—income homeowners
could no longer reﬁnance their mortgages based

on the rising value of their houses, gathering I

waves of default and foreclosure turned once-
exaltedgmortgage-backed securities into “toxic

V waste.”Thesetoxicassetsseverelyundermined
. the balance sheets of the most elite ﬁrms on

Wall Street, a major factor leading to the crisis
of 2008. In essence, gambling gone sour helped
bring the mighty American ﬁnancial sector to
its knees. to ~,  V » .

And as everyone bfws, or laments, we tax-
payers prevented the ﬁnancial industry from
self-destructing by bailing it out and buying up
its “toxic waste.” But whatever pejorative jibe
you aim at the bailouts or the Federal Reserve’s
buy-up maneuvers, the reality is that with the
bailouts, we correctly provided ourselves with
a critical safety net — total ﬁnancial collapse

would have reaped untold, perhaps unspeak-

able human cost. . A
‘Bringing it back to alcohol ’— as if there’s

' . anything else to talk about + itfsfasciriating
how closely collegiate underage drinking fol-. H

lows this model. ,

The risky behavior this time, of course, is
consuming alcohol while under the legal age of
21. And just as was true for the lending indus-
try, the regulatory environment fails to prevent
students from deciding to gamble + and often
morethanlightly. .

Think about it: Nothing isistopping underage

y like economy

behavior cause personal medical crises, often ‘

in the form of alcohol poisoning. Akin to the
. Treasury and Federal Reserve proppingup ailing
banks to forestall economic disaster, universities
across the country have chosen to build safety
nets to minimize the human cost of drinking.
Such nets are called alcohol amnesty policies.
By. not burdening students with any worry
of criminal records, the good amnesty policies
unmask the pure, compassionate incentive of
students to help their troubled friends, and in
doing so they reduce the chance of shameful,
unnecessary sickness and death. These ,“good
policies” — those shared by CMU and Temple
University — exempt both the helper and helped
from underage citation.

Pitt’s new policy fails to exempt the helped

individual. I believe it should.
Why? Because the only two ways to minimize
the human cost of risky behavior are either pre-

vention or outcome mitigation. Whereas the fed- ’

. eral government has the power to work at both
ends — it demonstrated its preventative power
. quite nicely before the 1980s, and its mitigative
efforts are still present today — universities like
Pitt have only outcomes to play with. Pitt should
make the most of its sole feasible option. Our
University should protect both the helper and
' the helped from underage citations. ,
Whoa, wait a minute. If Pitt became _more
compassionate, wouldn’t that promote even
more risky drinking behavior in an environ-
ment that already facilitates it? Perhaps. But
what’s clearer is that with or without a safety
net, underage drinking would reign. For bet-
ter or worse, alcohol has ingrained itselfin the
average student’s conception of natural rewards.
However austere Pitt makes its policy, it can
expect students to ﬂock to alcohol hoping to
create ﬁiendships, alleviate anxiety and loosen
sexual inhibitions. ' —.
Don’t get me wrong, a Pitt community that
ﬂoats inalcohol is_notthe ideal. But olferingonly

, perﬁmctory, half—compassion doesn’t bring us

close enough to a safe community.

VOLLEYBL

Pitt wins two, loses one in Invitational

Torie Wytiaz
Staff Writer

' No. 2 Penn State dominated in
’ nearly every statistical category

as the Pitt volleyball team fell to
the four—time defending nation-
al champions on Friday night in
front of 2,000 spectators in the
Fitzgerald Field House.

With few empty seats remain-
ing in the building, the’ atmo-
sphere seemed more like a Big
East basketball game than a pre-
season volleyball match,‘ but the

' Panthers were unable to pull off
the upset and fell in three straight .

sets — 25-13, 25-12 _and 25-18.
Despite the loss, the Panthers
ﬁnished the University of Pitts-
burgh Invitational with a winning
record of 2-1 —— with victories
over New Hampshire and Miami

(Ohio) — bringing them to 6-1 —

for the year.
The Nittany Lions ﬁnished with
more kills, blocks and digs than

the Panthers on Friday. Sopho-

more middle hitter Ariel Scott led
all players with 12 kills while fel-
low sophomore and outside hitter
Deja McClendon contributed 10
with a .625‘ kill percentage.

Still, the Panthers appreciated
the atmosphere that the nation-
ally ranked Nittany Lions helped
bring to Pittsburgh.

‘.‘It is deﬁnitely exciting to wel-
come one of the best teams in the
country and see thefan support
that it draws,” senior middle hit-
ter Keisha Leggs said before the
match. “You hear so much about
a team and their rankings, but it
comes down to the play on the
court.”

Sophomore outside hitter
Monica Wignot agreed, noting
that the Pitt team welcomed the
challenge of facing a nationally
recognized opponent.

“We always say we take things
one game at a time, but when a
team like Penn State comes to
play us on our court, it deﬁnitely
is a match that we anticipate and

look forward to playing,” Wignot,

said.

The Nittany Lions improved
their record to 2-1. Penn State
opened its season with a loss to

then-unranked Oregon before
bouncing back against then-No. 2

USC. Currently, the Nittany Lions

are ranked No. 2 in the country
behind 6-0 California. .
Leggs led the Panther offense
with her 10 kills while junior Mar-
gy Acton set the tone on defense
with nine digs. I
Pitt did not manage to gain a
lead until the third set when they
jumped out to a 6-2 advantage,
which lasted until an 8-3 Penn
State run put the Nittany Lions
ahead for the remainder of the set
and secured the match victory.

Pitt fell to N o. 2 Penn State in front of 2,000 specators at Fitzgerald Field House on Friday night. Penn

State won in straight sets -- 25-13, 25-12 and 25-18.’

“Overall, the weekend was a
success,” head coach Toby Rens
said. “Of course, we would have
liked to go 3-0, but with so much
hype surrounding the Penn State

, match, Iwas glad we were able to

focus on the other matches as well
and ‘come away with wins.”
The Panthers defeated New

Hampshire 3-1’“earlie1' on Friday ,

and then swept Miami (OH) 3-0
on Saturday afternoon. A
Against New Hampshire, soph-
omore Monica Wignot and junior
Jasmine Dittrich j oined Leggs with
double-digit kills while freshman

setter Lindsey Zitzke dished out
34 sets and contributed nine digs
on defense.

The Panthers won the ﬁrst set
against New Hampshire 25-15, but
fell in a close second set with a

2‘ score of 25-23. Pitt rebounded to

take the ﬁnal two sets 25-17 and
25-11. E _
“New Hampshire was able to

i put us on our heels in the second

set and won some big points,”
Rens said. “Still, I was¥p_leased

GREGORIAN RANTS

 

‘Panthers

can claim
nine titles

Greg Trietley
Senior Staff Writer

If you think the Bowl Champion-
ship Series fails to crown a true
national champion, wait until you
hear about the olddays. Wait until
you hear about ‘Parke H. Davis.

Pitt claims nine national cham-
pionships: 1915, 19’16, 1918, 1929,
1931, 1934, 1936, 1937 and 1976,
which places the Panthers sixth
all-time. Maybe you’ve looked at
the banner at Heinz Field and
wondered what systems decided
those championships and how
official the trophies are. Well,
Pitt’s.clai_ms are _legitimate, or as
legitimate as you can be when dis-
cussing pre—war football.

Before the Bowl Champion-
ship Series, there was the Dunkel
Index, the Dickinson System and
countless other formulas. Accord-
ing to the NCAA’s record book,

A there are 37 recognized past and

current “major selectors” that
determine national champions.
Some are mathematical indexes,
some are polls and one, Parke H.
Davis, was a researcher.

In 1933, Davis studied every
college football season from 1869
to 1932 and crowned a retroac-
tive national champion for each
one. Perhaps indecisive or per-
haps- non—confrontational, he
named co-champions 28 times
and awarded no championship
four times.

‘Davis named Pitt national
champion for 1929 and co-cham-
pion for 1915 (with Cornell), 1916
(with Colgate and Army) and 1931
(with Purdue).

Additionally, Davis awarded
Pitt a share of the national cham-
pionship in 1934, the year in
which he died. N

Nearly 40 years later, Sports
Illustrated, as Pitt’s media guide
puts it,’ “rese'a1:ghed  ﬁrst and

The sports section of The Pitt News proclaims Pitt the 1976 college football champions,

but six selectors chose Southern California as national champions that year.

Trietley 4 5

only complete and wholly accurate list

ever compiled of college football’s mythi- ‘

cal national champions.” The study logged
champions named by recognized polls,
indexes and doodads. One of those recog-
nized sources was Davis’ opus.

Pitt uses the article as the basis of its

_nine championship claims; In agreement
with Sports Illustrated, the study counts ‘

Davis’ 1915, 1916, 1929,1931 and 1934
championships.

Of course, Davis didn’t have the last
word in college football in the days before
jet planes. Take a look_at the 1915 cham-
pionship, for instance. Davis had Pitt as a
co‘-champion with Cornell. But the Helms
First Interstate, Bank Athletic Foundation
(defunct since 1982), the Houlgate Sys-
tem-(defunct since 1949) and the National
Championship Foundation (defunct since
2000) all had the Big Red as the outright
champion. . ‘

The Helms First Interstate Bank Ath-
letic Foundation used a panel of experts
to vote on a national champion, while the

_ Houlgate System based its rankings on a‘

team’s win—loss record, the team’s schedule
and the win—loss record of all the team’s
opponents. The National Championship

Foundation relied on a member vote.

Cornell and Pitt both call themselves
the national champion of 1915, which
would have made Davis, champion of the
co—championship, happy. ’ ' .

Then again, the Billingsley Report,

’ which uses point accumulation for wins

and loses, is now a part of the Bowl Cham-
pionship Series formula and had Nebraska.
as the national champion that year. That
school, like the Big Red and the Panthers,
went undefeated in 1915.

The 1916 season is another demonstra-

tion in retroactive convolution. That year,
the Panthers‘ were nothing short of domi-
nant,_as evidenced by every recognized

system namingthem the outrightnational , _ ’

champion — except Davis, who split the
title between Pitt and Army.

Today, Army doesn’t claim the 1916 sea-
son as a championship, and Pitt is consid-

.ered the unanimous choice.

The Black Knights are far from theonly
program to disregard possible national
championships. Notre Dame claims 11,
but it could justify at least two more. In
1938, the_Dickinson System (defunct since

1940) gave the Fighting Irish the national '
championship, but the Associated Press

bestowed it upon Texas Christian. A similar
incongruity occurred in 1953 when three
polls, including the Associated Press, made
Maryland their national champion but 10
polls selected Notre Dame and two others
chose Oklahoma. Notre Dame ignores non-
Associated Press or Coaches Poll champi-
onships post-1936. p

I Pitt, too, received national champion-
ship recognition not currently acknowl-
edged by the school. In one instance, the
National Championship Foundation gave
the 9-0 Panthers, which outscored oppo-
nents 282-0, a share of the 1910 crown,
but they choose not to wear it today (8-0-1
Harvard gladly wears it instead).

The National Championship Founda-
tion, like Davis, formed to retroactively
award championships. Unlike Davis, it did
so in 1980 -—— 10 years after the Sports
Illustrated article came out. Therefore,
Pitt do_esn’t link to its conclusions in its
media guide. _

But Pitt football can and doestrace
non—Davis championships to 1918, 1936

Pitt, Michigan both claim 1918 championship    

g Trietley 4 8 .

and 1937 through Sports Illustrated. In
1918, Davis, possiblyedisappointed in the
level of talent in college football that year,
didn’t crown a champion. But the Helms
and the“Houlgate did, and they crowned
(‘the Panthers, which went 4-1 but defeat-
ed defending national champion Georgia
Tech, 32-0. _
Meanwhile, the Billingsley Report gave
that year’s title to Michigan, and the Wol-
verines claim the 1918 championship too.
The Panthers media guide calls its 1918

championship selection unanimous, but
that would be news to Michigan. Michigan’s
media guide recognizes Pitt and.Michi—
gan as national champions in 1918, with
the Billingsley selecting Pitt, the Houl—

‘gate selcting Michigan and the National

Championship Foundation naming'co—
champions. _

Pitt’s championships in 1936 and.1937
came in the infancy of the Associated Press’
now-prestigious poll, which eventually
shifted importance away from indexes

, 17th Annual

like the Williamson System (defunct since

' 1963) and the Litkenhous Ratings (defunct

since 1984). ‘
In 1936, Illustrated Football Annual’s

» Boand System awarded the Panthers the
__ national championship, while the Associ-

ated Press gave it to Minnesota. Pitt claims
this non-AP championship, as it is duly
noted in the Sports Illustrated article.
For 1937, the shoe is on the other foot.
Pitt earned the Associated Press’ honors,
while the Helms chose California. The

out to win the match.” . _
Wignot echoed the sentiments of her ~~

coach and recognized the progress that
the Panthers have made in the early part
of the season. V

“Winning tough matches is a huge con-
ﬁdence builder, especially for the younger

_ players,” Wignot said. “These experiences _

help the team grow together.” _
The win against New Hampshire was
followed by the loss to the Nittany Lions.
Pitt recovered from the loss to defeat Miami
(Ohio), which Leggs said showcased the
team’s mental focus. ’
“Losing hurts, but you cannot afford to
bring it into the next match,” Leggs said.
“We could look‘ back to the Penn State
match and missed opportunities, or we

. could move on mentally and take care of ‘
Miami (Ohio).”

The Panthers did recover in their ﬁnal
match of the Invitational as they defeated
the Redhawks 25-22, 25-22 and 25-18, and
had two players, Dittrich and Zitzke, named
to the All—Tournament team.

Dittrich, a middle blocker, ﬁnished with
20 kills and eight blocks on {he weekend
and led the Panthers with a .312 hitting
percentage. Zitzke turned in an impress-ive
all-around performance, recording 88 as-
sists, 22 digs, ﬁve aces and ﬁveblocks in

_ the tournament.

“I was very impressed with the play of
Jasmine and Lindsey throughout the tourna-
ment,” Rens said..“]asmine was extremely
consistent and as a captain, was a great lead-
er for us. As a freshman, Lindsey has been
very successful at.running our offense.”

.The Panthers will leave Pittsburgh for
the ﬁrst time next weekend as they travel to
compete in the University of Central Florida
Tournament. I
