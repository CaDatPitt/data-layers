HIGH 1. Q.’S JUDGE
MARKS O. K. SURVEY

Students of high intelligence
judge their marks and examination
gr es more accurately than those
of lower intelligence, reveal tests
given last year in the psychology de-
partment.

Increasing tendency among stu-
dents who make poor grades to over-
esthnate their grades is shown in
statistics from the department.
Scholars who make A and B judge
their grades quite accurately. Those
who make C and D over-rate their
grades ten per cent, while those who
make F over-estimate their grades
twenty er cent. The records show
that B is the most frequently esti-
mated grade.

Class standing has no noticeable
eifect on estimations, and there are
few or no sex diiferences in the ap-
parent estimations of grades by stu-
dents, reports show.

DR. A. E. DAY It-‘LAYSI
JUDGE BEN LINDSEY
ozv ‘PAL’ MARRIAGE

States L a W y e r Evaded
Question By Causing
Laughter

 

“Companionate marriage is not,
as Judge Ben Lindsey insists, the
state of marriage as exists now pre-
vious to the advent of children or
in the case of childless couples,”

believes Dr. Albert E. Day, pastor
of C hri s t Methodist Episcopal
Church, who spoke on “Companionate
Marriage” before Y. W. C. A. Mon-
day m Heinz House. Dr. Day fur-
ther stated that Judge Lindsey re-
fused to state the question and to
discuss the real issues, in their de-
bate Wednesday evenig. “He rather
evaded the question by producing
ribald laughter,” said Dr. Day.

_ In deﬁning compaiiionate mar-
riage as he ﬁnds it in Judge Lind-
SeY'S_ book, “The Companionate
Marriage,” Dr. Day said it is license
for two persons to unite, not for the
purpose_ of child-bearing, but for
the satisfaction of certain desires,
as long as the individuals are will-
ing that such_ relations continue
without economic_al_, legal, moral, or
personal responsibility toward each

other.
Judge_ Lindsey has combined
three issues with companionate

marriage, namely, birth control, di-
vorce, and preparation for marriage,
but these questions, as far as he is
concerned, are not a part of com-
pamonate marriage, said’ Dr. Day.
Dr. Day agreed with Judge Lindsey
011, everything that can be sanely
said on these questions. He believes
that the world is headed, toward
birth control, but that there is still,
even in the minds of the strongest
advocates of birth control, the belief
that there are grave dangers, phy.
sicians and scientists hope that some
day they will be able to offer a safe
and sane method for regulating the
size of -families, Dr. Day stated. . De-
spite the ideal of permanency of
marriage, Dr. Day a that pro-
visions must be ma e for divorce,
and above all he believes that physi-
cal and psychological preparation
for marriage is essential. But these
questions, according toDr. Day. are
not companionate marriage. '

Companionate marriage is pro-
posed to solve two questions, the
problem of sex and the problem of
married life itself. Judge Lindsey

nomic conditions have .‘l§,tI3ﬂ_Qd,

ﬁrst he believes is wrong. ' 39¢.
ond under present economi_cal con-
ditions is impossible, leaving the
third as the only escape unless com-
ganionate marriage is adopted. Dr.

ay_ stated that he realized the
young people of today are facing a
moral battle, but that Lindsey’s
proposition is not the solution. “It
is a perverted idea. It is not a so-
lution, merely a surrender, "a thing
in itself to be abhorred. The finest
lives I know are where there is
sublimation.”

Companionate marriage begins
marriage with a trial marriage psy-
chology, nor does it set the right
kind of ideal, said Dr. Day. As a
minister he has had ﬁrst-hand con-
tact with all kinds of marriage, and
he has found that marriage is suc-
cessful only when. it is proposed as
a permanent thing, when it is begun
with the purpose of giving rather
than getting, when it fosters mutual
fulﬁllment of both parties, Dr. Day
stated. It should not be based on
fading inducements and talents, but
there should be a purpose to enrich
and pour that enrichment into the
succeeding generations.

When asked whether he thought
there was as much newspaper cause
for talk as exists, Dr. Day replied
that, from personal observations,
according to authorities, and from
the data collected by the Federal
Council of Churches in connection
with this question, the situation is
not as bad as Judge Lindsey would
have the public believe. Dr. Day
believes that the majority of young
people is opposed to discarding tried
principles of marriage for this new

Pill, From 1787 to 18/9, Suﬁers A ‘
Two Fires; Changes Sites Thrice

This is the second of a. series of articles concerning the early
history of Pitt, designed to acqutaint the student body with the real
signiﬁcance of Charter Day, to be celebrated February 28, in com-
memoration of the founding of the University.

 

.For nearly a century Pitt had its
second period of existence under the
name of Western University of
Pennsylvania-—from 1819 to 1909
The first period, from 1787 to 1819.
was under the name of Pittsburgh
Academy. During this period the
University occupied three different
sites. suffered two devastating tires
and changed from an obscure school
in a frontier town to a University
of national prominence.

In 1819 the State Leirislature

- changed the name of the Pittsburgh

Academy to that of Western Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania. and granted
that “forty acres of the vacant lands
belonging to the commonwealth
bounded by or joining the outer lots
of the town of Allegheny. be and
they are hereby granted to the trus-
tees of the Western University of
Pennsylvania upon which the Uni-
versity shall be erected." The Leg-
islature seemingly did not take into
consideration that the people of Al-
legheny preferred this forty acres as
a pasture for cows rather than as
a playground for students, and after
a court ﬁght carried to the Supreme
Court, the school lost its title to the
land. The Legislature recompensed

the school for the loss by a mone-
tary grant, however.

In 1830 a new university building
was completed on the corner of
Third avenue and Cherry alley that
was the architectural showplace of
the town. Previous to this time the
University occupied the remodeled
Academy structure.

Fires Cause Setback

In the decade between 1840 and
1850 two ﬁres occurred that caused
a temporary and almost permanent
setback of the University. In the
great ﬁre of 1845 that destroyed the
major portion of Pittsburgh, the
University building was destroyed
with all its records. The following
year a new building was built on
’Diique<ne Way. near where Stanwix
street crosses it today, but it too
was burned after three years of ex-
istence. For ﬁve years then the Uni-
versity existed in name only, but in
1855 a new building was erected at
the corner of Ross and Diamond
streets. At this time, we are in-
formed in Sarah H. Killikelly’s “His-
tory of Pittsburgh” the entire in-
come of the University was from tu-

University Book Store Serves
116,000 Students in Year
and Half

- Breaking a record in a period ex-
tending over eighteen months, from
July, 1926, to January of this year,
the University book store served
more than 116,000 students, accord-
ing to H. E. Meese, manager of the
book store.

A staff of »twenty-five student
clerks made sales at the rate of one
customer every forty-ﬁve seconds.-
Over 5,000 reference books were
sold during that period, which shows
an added desire on the part of stu-
dents to learn more of a subject
than is I presented in the assigned
texts, stated Meese. On the busiest
day during this period, 2,600 stu-
dents were served.

Ten Of Number Register In

A total of 141 new freshmen have
enrolled at Pitt and Johnstown Jun-

Pitt and ten enrolling at Johnstown,
according to the latest report of the
registrar’s oﬂice. Further change in
registration change is expected since
registration is expected since regis-
tration will continue throughout the
week,-states J. G. Quick, registrar.

Of the total number-of freshmen

enrolled in campus schools, seventy-- ,
8- ﬁve have enrolled

thirty-one in the school of Business
Administration, fourteen in the
school of Engineering and Mines,-«
and eleven in the school of Educa-
tion. At Johnstown junior college,
five students have enrolled in the
college, one in the business admiri-

engineering and one in the school of
education. ' ' ‘
The graduate school and the down-
town division. have a total of "265

this number having registered in the
graduate school and 206 registering
in the downtown division. '8 ‘

cording to the :egistrar’s report. The
great. success of pre-registration in
enablin students to register with-
out going through regular routine
work makes it an ideal form of reg-
istration in the opinion. of most stu-
dents and faculty advisers, Quick
stated. ot only does it relieve stu-
dent advisors_from a great deal‘ of
work, but it is a, great time-saving
method for all those who partici-
pate. A plication of pre‘-re ‘stra-
tion to al students by next all‘ is
hoped by Quick. . .

Oil and Gas School, Oldest In . ‘ . A
Country, Gets Moscow Greetings:

Pitt's Oil and Gas School has
been recognized as the oldest uni-
versity in America having an oil and
gas department, in a letter received
recently from the Moscow Mining

Academy by Professor Roswell J chri-
son, head of the Oil and Gas School
at the University. The Russian
academy also expressed a wish to
continue exchanging publications
with the local department.

The letter, which was sent from
the Commisariat of Public Instruc-
tion at the Mining Academy of Mos-
cow, reads in part:

Professor Roswell Johnson,
Dear Sir:——-

Allow me, in the name of the Mos-
cow Mining Academy, sincerely to
greet you and, in your person, the
oldest university in America with
its Oil and Gas Department, which
is closely related to your Academy.

It is with a feeling of deep grati-
tude that the academy accepts from
you the ancient photograph of the
first well drilled for oil by Drake. '

The Moscow Mining Academy will
be glad to enter into relations With
the Pittsburgh University on ‘the
ground of mutual exchange of scien-
tiﬁc publications, issued _by both
schools, and of communications con-
cerning the latest discoveries and
works, connected with the produc-

tion of oil. _—
Founded in 1913, the Oil and Gas

School was established in conjunc-
tion with a similar department at
the University of Birmingham of
England. Pitt’s bureau is the only
one of its kind in the eastern sec-
tion of the United States.

Professor J. N. Strigeoﬂ’, member
of the faculty of the Moscow Acad-
emy, and head of the Russian pe-
troleum industry, was a recent vis-
itor to the University. Prof. Stri-
geoif made a thorough tour of the
American petroleum industry, _and
was interested in securing American
petroleum geologists to come to
Russia.

This year’s students i_n_the School
of Oil and Gas are giving special
attention to the Russian oil produc-
tion, and many of them are con-
templating accepting positions in
Russia this summer. At present
there are forty-four students in the
oil and gas school: nine freshmen.
eight sophomores, seven juniors,
seventeen seniors, and three gradu-

ates.

Graduates of Pitt's oil and 
school are at present occu  ,_
portant executive and technica 
sitions in foreign and V domestic
ﬁelds. Of these graduates, there are
three in Colombia, ﬁve in Venezuela.
one in China, two in Japan, two in
Argentina, and one in Peru. Ex-
ploration trips are made by alumni

to China, Palestine, Rumania, Bo-
livia, Canada, and Mexico. _.-/’

ROGER SERGEL

ANY a student will tell you that Roger

. Serge! is the best composition teacher he
cvpr bad. But many more will ask, now that
ho’ has loft, “Did you ever take his! Victorlan
Poetry ?" For Roger Sergel's V1ctorlan'P_oetry
is always spoken of as a spiritual experience
by those who ‘attended it. The sparse ﬁgure,
of lautsrn jaw and towering forehead, the
c ose-cm ped head and deep-set forehead, and
I vs 3.1.. the voice that “could read a Mother

 

-‘Goose rhyme and make you weep” are not

casily forgotten by those who three times a

‘week learned to know what poetry is. - ,
It was, actually, going into" another world.

The tumult of Swinburne, the singing of

Morris, the purple glamour of the poets of the »

Nineties,“ passed in swift review before us. And
once, for three weeks, we listened to Brown-»
lllg’8' ,'1‘h;e«Ring and the Book--Guido France-

tchini, Pompilia and Caponsachi spin-ning out 
their tragic lives, with Serge1’s deep V0106 mak-V '
lug it‘. all scaldingly beautiful. Another time,

"Bemember' Me When I Am Gone Away” be-
came. arr‘-unforgettable sonnet. These are just
rellldmbercd at random. There are too many
things and too many thrills -to enumerate here.

“ Ahﬁrst, we. knew only that we" were getting a

!'sa‘l; kick out of poetry. Back of it was what
Roger» Scrgel wanted us to get, an understand-
ing of poetry and the germination of a desxre
to?’ make that poetry part of ourselves. -
Pitt, they say, does not have~ma.ny traditions-
Its traditions are of the future, over on the‘lot.
But one radition will be carried. with it to

  ONCE MORE .
_ ;” NEW" semester has begun, a new series of
A classes, tests and grades. Atpresent we
’ are wondering about in a rope maze much
as a group of guinea pigs in a_.. psychology
learning‘ curve test; afewvdays and we will be
at the enigma of matchirrg“a variety of class
coupons with an incongrohs‘ and as variegated
grou of rooms; and in afewi more days we
will playing three ,deep in the book store,
wgndsring why the harassed clerks are so
' w"’o J"  E. V
, ' This is all on the outside. On the mental
dds we will be interpreting. our classes and
téschors of the past semester in relation to the
grades that we received in each particular
course; and will be receiving impressions of
our new teachers, courses and classmates.
When we view this series of disturbing ele-
‘mgnts, the idea of semesters takes on a mock
importance in our minds. We are likely to
vlew last semester as something past, a closed
tccount, and the new semester as a distinct
 rather than as a. natural continuance of
a7 rat semester, and all other past semesters.
t would be well to compare our semester idea

. of education with a bamboo pole that is marked

in growth periods by a regular series of joints.
Each section between two joints is hardly a
anitln itself, but a combinationof all the sec-
ons makes the complete pole. Correspond-
lnxly we have a series of semesters, inter-
rs ted at regular intervals by the phenomena
dtfcll bed. in the opening paragraphs. Each
nsmestcr ls to a certain extent independent, but
a combination of all of them is necessary to
in what we call education.

'I'llus,while we may be justified in think-
 we are starting on a new urfit of edu-
ca on In this second semester, we must not
ovegook the fact that it is not a divergence
{to but rather a continuance of the first se-

_ The various rites between semesters
two are undergoing now do not have in-

 the importance that we are likely
to , ’ l :1 them. They-are merely the joint

distinct thrill as the pianist

Thursday night the same thrill

maninoff returns, there ap-
pears just 1 bit more of the
showman in the musician.
Only his enormous vigor and;
intelligence saves him from
the ranks of the brilliant
mountebanks. Only Rachman-
inoﬂ could have played such a
collection of favorite wor-
horses with such, success.

’ lieve, the only pianist in Amer-

‘ been real piano music, and 1“ al-

Q C O
MENDEfLSSOHN---
MINNEAPOLIS
T times little fogs at
doubt As to whether
Beethoven was as great as
biographers and critics clalm

’s,riIa in the mind. When one

hears a long dry passage from
a violin concerto’ on bungled
phrases of a not particularly
inspired symphony paneled
out, one is likely to feel like
acclaiming Irving Berlin as the
greatest composer. But after
such a performance as the

Mendelssohn Choir and the‘

Minneapolis Symphony gave of
tlfe Ninth Symphony all doubts
are dispelled.

Year by year Ernest bunt
becomes more and more an
enormous ﬁgure in thenlusical
world. Admitting that there
are some ﬁne singers in
Plttsburgh, the credit for the
success of the Mendelssohn
Choir must be given to Mr.
Lunt. He must have spent ‘an-
told hours of labour organizing
a group of voices, for the most
part relatively untrained, into
such 0- magniﬁcent, organic
unit as Choir. Pittsburgh has
an undeniable right to brag.
Even Kurt Schindler’: widely
P1‘!-ised Schola Cantorum can-
not surpass the ﬂexibility and
artistic ﬁdelity of Mr. Lunt’s
organization. The Minneapolis
Otcheltra, too, deserves all the
Praise that we can give it. All
tilld. I think Friday .nlght’I‘
concert was the most important
event in the musical history of
Pittsburgh.

s. D. Flinn, 16, Writes

A letter comes to the Alumni Of-
lice from ‘S. D. Flinn, Col. ’16, who
managed the 1916 basketball team.
Flinn is with the Superior --Type
Company, 3940 Ravenswood avenue,
and lives in Evanston. Mrs. Flinn
was Janet MacDonald, Ed. ’18.
Anent the victory of the Pitt has-
ketball team at Northwestern, Flinn
has the following to say: “Mrs.
Flinn and myself certainly enjoyed
the game against Northwestern. It
was a wonderful exhibition after
trailing in the first half, the whirl-
wind game our team put up in the
second half was little short of amaz-
ing. A team like that reminds me of
our old 1916 bunch. Perhaps this
year’s crowd has something on us
at that. ,

‘‘It was quite good to see.

on the very elaborate alumni pro-

gram which has been undertaken
this year. ~.This program "includes
the arranging of Alumni Clubrooms,

Why? .
The necessity ‘of this campaign is
outlined in. a circular“ which is fur-
nished all the prospects. This cir-
cular points out that during the Ca-
thedral of. Learning Campaign all
alumni ‘subscribers were awarded
free membership in the Association
for a period of five ‘years. . .
This action, which did away with
the major portion of the alumni in-
come, was taken’ in the expectation
that the Stadium would have ample
income to- help ﬁnance alumni ac-
tivities and, obligations. This. expec-
tation turiied. out to be premature.
Many felt at the time that the
move was hardly a proper‘ one to
‘safeguard the _alumni activity
ﬁnances, -but everyone was so anx-
ious to- co-operate and make the
;campaign a -success that tliei-e'was
no serious objection raised. An.
emergency is now upon us, however.

Whitey Zehfuaa Proves 1
Poison to All Panther
Basketball Opponents

By Nicholas G. Troilo

They are beginning to_ call him
“poison,” and really be has more
than emulated the big and little poi-
sons of the Pirate baseball team.
When the opponents see this Paul
Zehfuss dash out on the ﬂoor, they

sort of quake in their shoes and fully
know that he will make the evening
more than interesting. .

In the strict parlance of Soho,
“Poison Paul" is nothing more than
a little runt. He only stands 5 feet
6 inches above the ground, but even
an inch counts for just so much
poison. It seems that those ﬁve and
a half feet are nothing more than so
much Indian rubber. He is here,
there and everywhere, when it cornea
to playing basketball. As I
short men are not in deman on a
basketball ﬂoor, but Zehfuss has
more than proved his worth in spite
of his miniature size.

Zehfuss hails from South Hills.
He entered Pitt last year after ﬁnish-
in a wonderful period as a basket-
baler at South Hills Hi. In high
school Zehfuss found that his best
position was at
it for three years. In his last year
at South Hills he was selected as
captain of his team and probably
contributed more than anyone else
toward his team’s wonderful success
during 1926.

he began to pave the road to basket-
ball successlby playing on the Trin.
ity Church team. This West Penn
league team has made so much his-
tory that every boy knows its where-
fores. Trinity today sings loud its
praise of this diminutive star who
helped make things look so rosy{fo_r
them. Even from way off New ork
Jack Lippert, former Trinity mentor,
is telling the cockeyed world about
his boy protege.

Last year, while Zehfuss was a
member of the Pitt yearling team,
Coach Lou McMasters showed him‘ a‘
few tricks concerning the correct
playing of the forward position.
Zehfuss, Les Cohen, Hyatt, Wundcr-
lick “made” that ﬁne team. Zehfuss
showed so much -form that it was

fore McMasters selected him out or
a field of over thirty, to be runnin
mate to “Charlie” Hyatt. “Poison’
proved a real player.

This season found Carlson more
or less bewildered as to who to se-

yatt. Cohen, who previous y was
more than assured of a forward job,
failed to measure up to expectations
and Coach Carlson fell back on “Poi-
son Paul." Ever since Carlson made

During the W. U. P. period of
Pittsburgh’s history, William Thaw,
a member of one of Pittsburgh's

the Schenley Farms district into the
educational and civic center of
Pittsburgh, W. U. P. transferred to
its present site in 1909, and like a
reigner tired with his old country

name to the University of Pitts-
