There are a good many empty school houses in the world
, ’;today. And there are certainly many young people who are
 counting the days until they go back to school instead of the
 'days before the next holiday.
 L} That is one of the results of this war. It is one thing that
 we, as students, should remember.
 ' Next Wednesday is International Students Day. -It is a
day of dedication for students'throughout the world. Novem-
 ber 17 was selected as the date for this dedication because it
Flwas on that day in 1939 that the Nazis struck at the Univer-
asity of Prague. .

 ' ' On-. direct orders from Hitler, Stormtroopers rushed into

student dormitories and homes. Many students were shot in
the raid, others. were beaten and herded into cars and buses.
Under heavy guard,.they were driven to the Ruzyn airﬁeld in
the suburbs of Prague. ’ ' ‘
 For the rest of the day, they were'tortured——-some were
st,ripped,' drenched with ﬁre hoses and forced to lie for hours
on icy ground; some were made to run the gaunlet of_a line
of‘ Nazis armed with whips. Throughout the day, the raid con-
‘; tinued and 156 student leaders were executed. About 1200.
El’-«were taken to concentration camps in Germany. Many teachers
suffered similar brutalities. .

'5  " Czechosovak universities were closed by order of the
"~Ge'stopo. Czech students who managed" to escape and make
‘ﬂ-their way to Britain through the Battle of France, sought
'"s"ome‘iway toicommemorate their friends. International Stu-
dents Day‘ was the, result. From a single meeting in London in
...the autumn of 1941, it was transformed to a ‘commemoration
:7i.»and dedication reaching New York, Chungk_ing, Delhi, Can-
 _berra, Moscow, and Jerusalem. * ‘ .
._  , This year we can celebrate this day with the knowledge

‘'?-of coming allied victory. It will be celebrated in colleges and
J-eyuniversities throughout the world with rallies and withserious
’-“ -thought of the future. Students in the United States, China,
Russia, India, students in South America, in Great Britain, in
‘Canada, ‘Australia and New Zealand will all send their mes-
sages of solidarity and hope to their brotherswho are ﬁghting
-the enemy. ' ' ., __ i ‘ ' ' f I
 ‘ In the words of the International ,Si.1.1dent’Council: “We
‘ "must so work that November 17, 1944, _will"be joyfully cele-
Eb1'ated.in the streets of Paris and Peping, of Kiev, Warsaw‘ and
Belgrade, of Brussels, Amsterdam, Athens and Prague.” .\
 Pitt will not‘ have special ceremonies next Wednesday.
Instead, a program has been planned for December 7. But we
should not set any one,day aside for; our dedication to the
._students of the world. -That should be an ever-present thought
in ‘our minds. - ~

ducted separately and. headed by_

Dents‘ contributed one hundred
-per cent to the drive, pledging $2
each, except for the ﬁfty-ﬁve stu-
dents in the sophomore class, who
gave $5 apiece. AST men and Air

tion,” both he and Mclntosh added.

Sports Editor

f In the first issue of‘ the Pitt -News, we were guilty of a
greivous error. For in commenting on the scarcity of coaches,

‘e mentioned the fact that Assistant Coach ‘_‘Doc” Hartwig
had been “called upon to do everythingbut carry the water
bucket and spray the ﬁeld.” This brought ,a hurt reproach from
Doc who wished to be credited with carrying the water bucket.

., It should be said now that Doc has not only carried the
.water.bucket but, in the three years he has_ been here, has
been the assistant tennis coach, freshman basketball coach,
Army and CA instructor, director of intramural athletics,
ootball scout, and, currently,_head professor of the football
"(lass taught the Physical Education majors.

 ‘Doc, we _might add, bears the perfectly respectable name
hr Charles Crawford Hartwig. No one seems to know
a;n;y"particular reason for his nickname aside from the fact
hat his father is a physician and that he himself, in a possible
ttempt to become legal, started out as a pre—med. Letters
jaegularly come addressed to ,“Dr., Hartwig” and students, in
earnestness, cite him as “Dr. Hartwig.” This is sometimes
 but more often it tends to be embarassingiin Dool-
l'e'”ge"vwhere doctorate degrees are taken very seriously.

:3 The vital statistics show. that-» Doc, one of footballis
, :.i:eat,guards, was born in a place called.Benwood in West (By
 "&o_‘d:il)i Virginia. He came to Pitt in 1930,.but his sophomore
'1 .2. ,ear,was spent on_ the sidelines nursing a,knee injury. This
s~‘%e1;..yeac his varsity debutjuntil 1932.-Pitt played in‘ the Rose
that year and lost to Sout_her_nVCalifornia. Doc played
he-'latter part of that game with a broken shoulder. With
 score" 35-0 and only a few minutes left to go, Stanley Olenn,
tlieg; Pitt tacklertried to ‘niake Docjldave the game.-Doc re-
iised. _‘‘I don’t want them to think-I’in a quitter,” he said.
_‘ :.P_Doc captained the 1934 Pitt team which is considered one
of "the "greatest football elevens in history.’He' also took the

‘»ll§American h_ono,rs that year. " ' ‘
,. Contrary to the general impression of football players,
‘l5;oc” was a pretty fair student. He graduated with a better
than twopoint average and was tappedyto ODK and Kappa
Kappa, honorary education fraternity.
 Strangely enough, itwas the 1937 Automobile Worker’s
strike thatpushed Doc into coaching. He was district man-

ger for General ‘Motors when the strike‘closed the plants.
While he was Waiting for them to reopen, he was offered _a 'job
coaching at Moundsville. He accepted and his team that year
 eight games, lost one and tied: one. ’
1 ” ‘The following year he "moved to Martin’s Ferry. His two
 year record_there was fourteen won, four lost, ‘and’ one tied.
 9 A‘ good ‘example of Doc's willingness to hurt himself‘
ather than do something he does not. believe is right can be
"found in one incident at Martin’s Ferry. ' 4

I ‘One of the outstanding linemen on his team kicked a third
stringer in practice. When the assistant coach protested, the
boy insulted him with a few classic comments. Doc then de-

niafnded that the boy apologize to the Coach and to the team

  

   
  

  

S  was adamant, and the player ﬁnally did apologize.
 For his greatest thrill, Doc is inclined to sélect the 1932
«§}Ioti*e Dame’ game. Pitt pulled the big upset that year, win-

 12-O. Pitt also defeated the Irish 14-0 in 1933 and 19-0 in
_}93_%, but as Doc says, “By that time, beatingthem was no_th-

  

   

~ , Doc returned to Pitt in the spring of 1941, when he
joined Charley Bowser’s coaching staff. He’ was the only mem-

"came here. ..

  Doc married former Pitt co-ed Dorothy Frazier ten
days after his graduation in 1935. They have three children,

earing the picturesque names of Barby (this is translated
int f’ Barbara), Bucky (this one is Charles Allan Hartwig) who

anthers Prepare For P

By Elaine Kahii, Sports Editor 0

But for one difference, there’
is a curious parallel between
the game "Pitt played-with Ohio
State last Saturday and the
game they played with Notre
Dame eight weeks ago. On
both occasions the score ran over
forty points. On both occasions
they were outweighed and out-
manned. But only last Saturday

could it be said that Pitt was out-
fought.

Since it was charged last week
thatthe Pitt student body did not
deserve its team, it is "only fair to
add this Week that the team that
‘carried Pitt’s name on the ﬁeld
against Ohio State did not deserve
the student body.

It was not the 46-6 score that
hurt. Admittedly, Ohio State had
a superior team and it is doubtful
whether Pitt could possibly have

sionf Pitt gave throughout the game
of -not. caring very much or trying
very hard. .
The team had been given all the
tools needed for that game, for no
team was ever better scouted than
‘was Ohio State. ‘With one excep-
tion, everyiplay the, Buckeyes ran
was one that had beencharted and
a defense set up against. And cer-
tainly, no team in recent years has
received the backing the student
‘body tendered both at therally and
at the game. * ’
Unfortunately, the charge of
innocent as Well as the guilty. For a
football team has -to be made up of
eleven men caring and working to-
gether. Two or six or even ten men
who care are not enough. You have
to have eleven in there at the same
time. i . .v .. ’
Motion pictures of the game serv-
ed only to make things look worse",
for they showed that. Pittalways
had men in position to stop the. play
7,7-except that they didn_’t. On Park’s
‘ﬁrst 68 yard touchdown run, there
were no lessithan ﬁve Pitta men who
could’ have or should have stopped

him. .

there were three men standing di-
rectly in front of Parks. Yet, -he

failed to tally. This was early in the
second quarter between touchdowns

admiring glances from his former ‘coach,

Pays Visit toF-ormercampus,‘ Coach 

Football has its Four Horsemen,
baseball, its Tinker to’ Evers to
Chance. And Pitt basketball has its
great trio of names, Charley Hy-
st, Clair Cribbs, and Don Smith.

’ The last of these, A Don Smith,
now a Lieutenant (jg) in"the Navy
DentalCorps, was in town last week
and took time off‘ to visit his for-
mer coach," Dr. H. C. Carlson.-

Dr. Carlson refusesto commit
himself on the issue of which of the
Hyatt-Cribbs-‘Smith trio was the
best, buthe admits that “Don was
one of my best boysvand certainly
the fastest dribbler I ever. saw.”

. The ‘Doctor’ saw Don play only
oncembefore he came to Pitt. That

was in an elimination game at the
Stadium between Bellevue, Don’s

school, and Uniontown. “Don was
put out of the game in the‘ ﬁrst

quarter for personals,” the Doctor
reports, “and I knew right..then
thathe was my boy.”

Don played for the Panthers from

1930.to 1933. After his graduation
from Dental School‘ in 1934,‘ ‘he con-
tinued to play basketball_ with the
Corbetts, -Republicansp McKees-
ports, -and the Pittsburgh‘7Pirates.
As a member of the Corbetts,’ only
last year‘-Don played against Dr.
,Carlson’s -“Rinky-Dinks,” and he
claims that their‘ line record was
no surprise ;to him. “They looked
pretty good to" us,” he said.

The highly, controversial “freeze”
game the Panthers played against
Penn State last year brought" only
lukewarm approval from Don. “I

‘ guess it wasone way “of stopping

them,” he said, “but personally, I
amin sympathy with the zone de-
fense, and I think thatis what I’d
use if I were coaching today.” Don
also debunked the theory that the
“freeze” game was anything new.
“We used the same thing against
West Virginia in 1929. Charley
Hyatt just held theiballfor ‘ten
minutes..Theyldidn’t have the ten-
second rule then.”

Present day basketball is getting

papers that _a boy died du_ring a
game last year, and I think the
speeded-up game had a lot to do
with it. It wears the boys out. Elim-
ination of the center jump was bad,
because that, atleast, gave the
boys a chance to rest.”

Charley Hyatt, incidentally, came

“Charley is the best there is,” Don
declared. “I was only a freshman
when Charley was a senior. We had

too fast, Don fears. “I read -in the_

in for some praise from .Don.-

to scrimmage "against him every
night." He added ruefully, “.VVe al-
ways _got beat.”y I V ’

._Don is stationed at the Bain-
bridge Naval .Training Station in
Maryland. He brought back‘ some
enth_usiastic_ reports..about ex-Pitt
footballer Bill Dutton’s playing for
the undefeated Bainbridge team‘.
Joe Maniaci, former"Chicago Bear
player, is the football "coach there,
a fact that was of interest to Pitt
Coaches Clark Shaughnessy and
Dr. Dan Fortmvann." '

.D'on reported that he had been
asked to coach the basketball team
but did not wish to do so as long as
there was a chance of playing. At
present,'however,~ he is a little wor-
ried about being over his playing
weight. f‘I’v_e gained 30 pounds in
the eight months I’ve been in the
Navy,” he confessed. . A

While he was still in school, Don
eloped with Dorothy Dovey, who
was selected the most "beautiful Pitt
girl in 1933. He kept the marriage
a secret until his ﬁnal .year. “I
don’t think Doc ever forgave me
for that,” Don insists.

Doctor Carlson, however, stated
that _Don had only one fault “He was
too unselﬁsh. I remember that once
he cost us a ball game because he
didn’t realize how good a long shot
he was and insisted on letting some-
one else shoot at I’ the basket.”

Asked if he would like to have Don
playing for his team this year, the
Doctor declared, “I’d like to have

him playing for me any year}?

 for the evening: .“/Whether the

‘i This town hall styled meeting
] ‘opened ‘ the thirteenth Pittsburgh
dseason of FPA whose purpose is
tokeep before the publicfacts on
 which to have judgments of in-
 ‘’ ternational relationships. 4 Dr.
'{_"Judd,_"for tenyears medical Con-
' gregational missionary to China
 and Mr. Thomas former Pres -

 “We’ve, got to hang together, or

and by organized security in join-
ing with our neighbors which. gives
this ‘-opportunity of formulating
policies. If we can’t run, escape or
buy the world the only alternative
is to join it. -

Thomas, opening his negation
with. the statement that a social.-
ist in Pittsburgh the week after
the election was also a missionary
said that the difference between
Judd and himself lay in the em-
phasis, “I believe in the theory
and practice of marriage but not
to a blind date.” V

He disagreed that our prosper-
ity after the war' must come from ,
foreign trade but rather should‘
come from right here in America
with the right production and a
consumption. He believes in co-
operation, but cooperation for the
good of mankind whether he be
English, Amercian, German, or
Japanese. We can’t get real world
cooperation when the provisions
are written by those major "pow-‘
ers in terms of concession to their
own interests, reiterating what
he had said last year speaking at
Carnegie Lecture Hall that Peace
through Police is impossible.

As a conclusion to his speech,
Norman Thomasstressed, “A’ suc3

‘cessful communtiy cannot be held

together by force to settle disputes
(the League of Nations), but by
forces that prevent them. The only

p_o_lice force that can be effective is

the plan of Ely Culbertson of a
quota force principal, the only log-
ical answer. Any peace will only be
secure if ‘America and her allies
recognize that there is equality of
man among man races. A nation

Hi Guys,

Well, nobody can say the E. 
M. dance wasn’t good . . . my gum-
shoe detail tells me it was the first
one that didn't go entirely in the

hole. . . . Most of the fellows had a
rip-roaring time, but one eminent
bundle of charm. really took our
boys over the coals. . . . Think of
it, meeting an old bizad ﬂame and
leaving our engineer holding his
hat after the dance. . . . You’re on
our blacklist sis . . . yessiree. . '. .

And if any of you want dates
Friday, I don’t think you’ll get
a Pitt women. . . . The Dean of
Gals sent personal invites to just
about everyone I know_ to attend.
the Army dance at the Masonic
temple. . . aw shucks . . . we’ll
let them go one night won’t we?
. . . You’re damn right we will. . . .

Say . . . I reckon you’ll all want
to buy tickets to the Turkey Trot
...w0n’tyou? ...heh..‘.heh .. .
heh. . . . Dody I-Iurrell says she will
dance _with everyone that buys a
ticket from me. «. . . Gosh, she’s
sweet. . . . Oh, incidentally, it’s at
the Wm. Penn. ~.‘ . . Pittsburgh
Room. . . . November 20. . . . The
line forms to the left of the water

I have noticed some interesting
triangles ' inlthei offing among us
. . . so‘.‘. . before any of our boys
get stung . .“. just remember this:'
It is good to be marry and wise ’

It is good to be honest and true
