The la.st.issue of your paper con-

tained the ‘report of’ the Student Ac-

tivityV Board « fer the / past  year, in.’

which the-Cap and Gown ‘received as

or the Musical Clubs; ﬁve’ times ‘as,

about eight times as\much- _as the

Student iBa,nd.  I wish to lprotetst
against thelgiving from the Student-

Activity) Fund, ofrany sum to anor-
ganization that is neither a student
activity nor an lorganizatiou that has

T the student- interests» at heart. ’ .

The club is composed of three

,classes of T’members,.tlle least import-
‘ ant ‘of_w.hich, except. from a ﬁnancial .
viewpoint,’ are the‘ students.“ At pres-
T ent practically all the ‘oflicesare ﬁlled

by other v than students.- The Uni-

‘ ‘vet-.sity authorities have little control _
 over it except in one" or two instan-T. ‘

ces. Th<eTAdviso_I"‘y Board may call

the club is on a trip. The entire con-"
stitution points toward -a_closed cor-A
~ﬁporaT.tion in ’W11lChT“ the: Alumni and
Associate members ~ predolmina.-te'., This
being the case they havelno right to .
the »SuDP0Tt bf the‘ students unless -the; 
students want to giveit to them. And’

this support should be voluntary and
not compulsory. p
The Cap and Gown. Club does not

-have the interests of-the student’ at  ’
heart_ for ‘he is ‘usually given the
worst of the ~deal.V_ VVhen the seat’

sale opened last year I was informed
that‘ the only seats left were the. last
few rows on the first ﬂoor xazid about
row fourteen in the balcony. The west
had been’ given to __the ‘elite of the
city a,1T1dTto differentfrclubs. ,This was

what I,Twho asla student had paid (my -

$3.50 in fees,-was up against.

I would like toask a fewquestions:
- If the entire student body are com-
pelled ~to
should they -not get first choice of
seats? V‘ . , V T

If the club is composed of and run
for the beneﬁt‘ of the Alumni and the

elite of the city why force the student

to pay and make it optional with the
others?  H ‘ ’ — 4

 Why shouldithis club be supported -

at the expense of Debating- and ‘Ora-
tory? Are we forgetting the true pur-

pose of the_ institution? We wonder

why m.ore‘m‘en do not go out for de-
bating. .W;hen wesee the proportional
-value that is‘ given -to each bythe Uni-
versity canfyou blame them for pre-
shun the debating hallsr? * . ..

 Why should such? student or organ-
izations as the_ Panther, the Pitt

_.ferrii1g to do the Merry Whirl. and to ‘

Players, the Student. Senalte, and the ,
Y. M, C. A., be discriminated againstt? To

Are they not of equal, if not greater‘

A -Gentlemen: A
WWhy is it that so many Seniors
leave Pitt full of disgust and regret?
I _think the principal reason is care-

’ -lessness and indifference on the part

of some of the advisers. Many ad-
visors keep. no records and ﬁll out
the students’ cards‘ without making
sure that all back work has been done.)
Theincessant changes inthe courses,
-the appalling lack of a_ schedule sys-
tem—-which often prevents one from
taking’ .the subjects he should-—the
frequency with , which. records are
lost, the jealousy between certain
schools, all contribute to make it dif-
ﬁcult for the student to »~ know when

‘To HOLD CONVENTION

The eighth annual convention of the
Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity will be
held with the Omicron chapter of the
University of Pittsburgh, on Decem-
ber 27, 28 and 29. Omicron, which
is composed of colored students en-
rolled at the University, was organ-
ized January 31, 1913. Ormicron chap-
ter sent delegates to the conventions
in Washington ‘and -Chicago during
the last two years. It is expected
that about 60’ delegates and visitors
will be in attendance, A public re-
ception will be tendered the visitors
on Monday, December 27. Cards of
admission will soon be in the mails.

On the evening of December tenth
the Delta Sigs and. their lady-frens
danced at the home of Brother George
West and Brother Charles West. The
dance was charmingly arranged and
beautifully informal. Mr. and Mrs.
.West, assisted by the hosts, received
the guests as they arrived and when
introductions and business of ﬁlling
dance cards were over, an orchestra
struck up “Ragging The Scale” and
away everybody went on
winged feet. One of the popular and
most respected features of the even-
ing was our old friend Paul Jones, but
an innovation was introduced from the
fertile brain of Brother Morgan, that
the men charge for their "partners.
Results recorded, no harm done, and
everybody happy. At twelve o’clock
supper was served and then dance
some more until one. The programs
were done in black and white, the

white Greek letters on a black back-‘

ground.

 

Congratulations are in order» to the
Delta Omicron sorority which -has se-
cured Delta. Delta Delta. Tri Delta is
one of the largest national sororities
in t=he country, and little can be said
that isnot trite of the beneﬁt to Pitt
by obtaining this chapter. They say,
the Delta Omicron sorority, though
young in years, is old in experience,
and quite capable of holding a place
among the national chapters of the
country, Every best wish is tendered
them. We are sure they will succeed.

 

Saturday afternoon at three o’clock,
in the gym, the Sophomore girls en-
tertained the Juniors. They say, it
was a very nice, informal party, at
which games were played and dancing
danced. The Freshmen have enter-
tained the Sophomores, the Sophs the
Juniors; if the Juniors entertain the

Seniors, will the Seniors entertain the A

Fresh? .

 

Unparalleled in the Annals of Pitt!
Winter wind, thou'art not so cruel
as mans ingr-atitude! And ‘of all peo-
ple to be ungrateful,’ Freshmen!
Words fail us! The incident was this:
A week ago or so the School of Child-
hood obligingly and condescendingly
arranged a party for the Freshmen
girls of the ‘school. It was a nice
party. Everyone had worked hours
and hours at details and decorations,
and delectable delicacies to delight
demur little Freshiesl The hour ar-
rived, everything was in readiness,
the hostess put little loving pats of
ﬁnishing touches to details (mention-
ed above). But what meant this de-
lay? The hour waxed late. It grows
later still. “Do the girls think this
is a dinner party?” was the (question
asked. Pretty soon, one of the scouts
on the lookout was seen waving her
hands frantically, “A guest, a guest!”
One lone Freshman was seen ap-
proaching the stately portals. She
was ushered in, she was entertained,

she was lavishly bid to eat, drink and
be merry. But where were the other
ninety and nine? That is what those
School of Childhood hostesses are
asking each other.

THE GOGGLE FAD

The first pair that horizz on our
horizon excited much sympathy. To
think that such a handsome lad should
have to wear the nasty big things!‘
The next pair we saw w.as driving a
big roadster, and we mistook them for
chauffeurs’ goggles, but as they be-

came numerous, we became curious. ’

Warum‘? What was the excuse, I
mean the reason, for wearing the
things? Ofcourse on a particularly
“no-body home” phiz, they do some;
what modify the stranger’s impres-
sion, that “no-body» ever lived there.”

Then too, they are rather becoming
to blonde men, performing about the
same service as a beauty patch, but
they make a dark man, with tall hair,
look like a cross between an emaci-
ated book-worm, and a third rate vil-
lain. Well here’s to the goggles, big
and black, and beautiful. But pour-.
quoi?

 

THE WALRUS SAID:

The time has come to pursue the
passing pence; nab the non-suspect-
ing nickel, and by all means, wise and
otherwise, form an alliance with the
elusive shekel, for Christmas is com-
ing, and she has expensive tastes.

 

Thanks, W. A. A. That Dairy Lunch
stuff sure was good; the girls . who
w re responsible for it must be special-
izing in interior decoration.

DISPUTE ABOUT FRESH MAN

We had an honest-to-goodness- class
fright in State ,on Monday morning-—
because one little Freshie insisted on
being unconventional. Him wouldn’t
wear him’[s little blue and gold
bonnet! Several husky Sophs landed
on his slender frame and one ingenu-
ous lad secured a- pair of shears from
the G-hancellor’s oﬂice. ,

The Sophs having no sense of pro-
priety knew that the marble staircase
in State Hall is not’ a shave store, so
they hastened Friend Fresh out into
the cold, cruel world and~—then noth-
ing happened for he promised to be

a good boy and buy him tomorrow one ,

OPEN MY AIIDIIIGIIT .

 
   

 

The treasured library of the late’, I
Theodore M. Barber, of the University I y 
of Pittsburgh, is slowly being arrang- I
ed for cataloging and appraisal under V

theldirection of the executors of the
estate, the Safe Deposit and
Company. I

The work is not without interest.

Now and again from the mound of
books is discovered some odd or un-
usual edition of classic literature,
some unexpected volume which re-

* vealed something of the character of

the man who acquired’ it. ~
Two weeks ago these books, cov-
ered with the dust of years, crowded

the nine rooms of the Morewood ave- is

nue house in which Prof. Barber liv-

ed the life of a recluse since his re- .

tiremenit from the university, almost
two decades ago. Few persons ever
had seen the collection.

chief interest of his later years was

centered in the increasing and cata- .

loging of his library.
Prof. Barber died in St. Francis hos-

pital_NoveInber .25. Not until near the

end did he indicate any wish ,t make
a will. Then he told friends of is de-

sire to dispose of his books and other

property. But by the time the neces-
sary preparations were made, the old
man had lapsed into a state of coma.
There was. no disposition of the prop-

erty, consisting chieﬂy of the library,“ - I
which has been valued at ﬁgures vary-”

ing from $15,000‘ to $30,000.-

Prof. Barber was buried November
27. Wagons drew up before the now
empty house in Morewood avenue
Monday morning, November 29. All
‘day men carried boxes of books from
the building. The bewildering dis-
order in which the professor had

placed his books, a disorder to which .,

only he held the combination, and
which he had protected from less
familiar and loving hands by refusing

to have the house cleaned for years, .. 

was disturbed for all time.

The books were taken to a conven-
ient place for arrangement. They were
heaped in a great pile in the middle
of the room, as if a temporary monu-
ment had‘. been raised to the old
bibliophile’s- memory. A

It is understood that several move-
ments are afoot among the friends,
colleagues and former pupils of the
late professor to purchéise the collec-
tion and establish it as a memorial.

Wayintention-a.l1y dis-courteous to the
“State Band or to your cheering sec-

apparent lack of respectlon the part
of the Pitt Band was purely uninten-

prevented by an arrangement be-

which will provide .a deﬁnite plan for
the division of time allotted the re-

For the Pitt Band, we wish to state
‘fhat they Were. uninformed concern-

the University by playing our “Alma.

noise of their own instruments when

that the friendly duel between halves
can be so directed by a. mutual agree-

Track prospects for the year were
very bright but the announcement that
the ‘Duquesne G-ardens were to ‘ ‘be

quietus on this branch of athletics for
the present. The meets which were
to be held this winter in the Garden

The extent to whiclithe track work
will be carried on this year depends
a great deal upon whether or not the
institution is admitted to the Inter-
collegiate association.

“Now, whatfis‘ a conviction?’ -Itlis‘

the belief in the possession of abso-
lute truth on any matter of knowlé
edge. A .-mean» of convictions is not
necessarily‘ a man, of scientiﬁc
thought; often -he has got ‘beyond the
pciut where -science can help him.
Thousands of splendid men and~wo-
men have sacriﬁced themselves for
their convictions  imagined they

were doing God service. “Few indeed,

have ever sacriﬁced themselves for the

truth. dﬁonvictzions are so mucheas-0

ier and cheaper than the truth; you

can manufacture them over night if

you are pressedjfor time. Youcan
take them second hand from some-
ody who has a superﬂuity. Most of

the quarrels betweenmenare d-ue to"

their convictions and not to their
zeal for the truth. If people, could
just be persuaded to make half the
sacriﬁces for the ‘truth and devo-ted
only ;a fraction of the time to its at-
tainment that theydo to defending
their convictions, how much happier

‘is. old, lZ_'I‘Ol.1‘bled—_VVVOI‘ld‘ would be.
Men are killing themselves by the

the truth is in exile. T=he§-most tra-

gic phase ofthis wonderful struggle.

is that Inenhave brought.-sthemselves
to ‘the condition where they can not
even recognize the truth: ‘

.“Our,task”heree is to supplant the

passionate -and uncritical loyalties of

thestreet by the ireasoned loyalties,

of a view of life that is based upon
the truth. To get this, of course, we
must have the ope-n-=mind,.1 -. .—
“It goes. without .saying".aI‘so, tha'.t
with open mindedness mustgo loyalty
to the truth. Here again. the ‘Great
Teacher has struck the keynote of

‘Ye shall “know the truth and the

truth shall make you free.’

that the old Greeks loved is one that

lectual ancestors. WeV must ‘agonize
together with the -great spirits of the
past that have grappled with the mys-
teriesof the universe and worked out
their own salvation with fear and
trembling. Mark Twain has ‘said some
where, ‘Be good and your "will be
lonely). I It is also true that he who
would be free "must elect to stand
alone; there is no vicarious atone-
ment in‘ the scheme of intellectual
salvation.” ‘ . . / .

In conclusion Dr. Mecklin empha-

sized the sacredness of pe.rsonality2

-and the inevitable temperamental,\'_dif-
ferences that ‘develop in our attitudes

“Dr. Webster is not .a newcomer in

ent volume is entitled a ‘History of,
the Democratic Party Organization in
the Northwest.’ Dr. -Webster has de-
voted his. ;attention'almost entirely to
the development of the political parity
machinery of the Democrats. The
study is. based almost entirely on news-
paper sources. The Party organization,
