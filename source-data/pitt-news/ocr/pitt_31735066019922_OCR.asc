VOLUME ElGHTY—TWO, ISSUE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN

By Marc Duchin
Editor in Chief

Pitt launched construction.
Monday on a $60 million bi-
omedical science tower which
is ”the centerpiece” of a new
construction complex, estimat-
ed to cost over a quarter of a
billion dollarsfaccording to
Pitt President Wesley Posvar.

The nine—|evel medical
research tower will be built
over the northern portion of
the Presbyterian-University

commencement ceremony.

Pitt constructing new

Hospital garage, located on
Darragh and Terrace Streets,
and is scheduled to be com-
pleted in 1990. The construc-
tion/renovation project will
add five buildings to Pitt's
School of Medicine and is es-
timated to cost $280 million.

”This will be a very impor-
tant part of the university and
a very important part of Pitts-
bu rgh’s corporate research es-
tablishment,” said Posvar.
”This biomedical science tow-
er will contain leading inves-

tigators in the fields for which
the medical school is already
prominent.”

According to Thomas Detre,
senior vice president for health
sciences at Pitt, the new tow-
er’s laboratories will conduct
research in pharmacology,
molecular biology, neurology,
cancer, genetics, immunology
and cardiovascular areas.

”The situation [in biomedi-
cal science] is very different
from what it was 20 years
ago,” said Detre. ”Many

things we do in the laboratory
find almost immediate appli-
cation.”

The project is also designed
to alleviate some of the park-
ing problems in Oakland. Ac-
cording to Ronald Forsythe,
project executive, two parking
garages will be constructed on
what are now tennis courts on
Robinson Street and under an
office building on Bigelow.
The garages will provide
1,600 to 1,700 parking spaces.

Posvar to head West Point inquiry committee

By Marc Duchin
Editor in Chief

Pitt President Wesley Posvar
will head a panel of outside in-
vestigators to review the honor
code system at the United States
Military Academy. Posvar said
however, that panel members
have not yet been selected.

Posvar, a 1946 West Point
graduate, said that the panel will
review West Point's honor code,
procedures, and history over the
last 20 years.

”The panel will work torwards
the future to improve procedures
that relate to the code of profes-
sional values of the whole insti-
tution,” Posvar stated.

Recently, Anthony S. Ketron, a

‘West Point cadet, was expelled

and subsequently reinstated by
the Pentagon after charges that he

lied to two instructors. Posvar
said however, that the ‘review
panel was not formed in response

to that incident. ”That was an iso-

lated case," he ‘noted. ‘
Two members of Congress and

the assistant secretary of the Army
who reinstated Ketron, reported
that his dismissal was too severe
a penalty for what appeared to be
a minor transgression.

Ketron was charged with lying
about the status of a paper re-
quired for a Rhodes scholarship
application. Two instructors said
that Ketron deceived them by tell-
ing them that the other was help-
ing him with the project. Ketron
maintained that the instructors
misunderstood and that he did
not intentionally mislead them.

In another recentcase, a West
Point cadet claimed that his
refusal to psychologically haze
incoming freshman led to his ex-
pulsion from the academy. The

cadet, a junior with a 3.59 GPA,
was described as a ”marginal
cadet” by Army officals.

”West Point has had problems
with procedures,” said Posvar.
”There’s been public apprehen-
sion about it.”

Posvar also said that West Point
has changed in some ways over
the years. ”Academically, it
[West Point] is far more sophisti-
cated,” he observed. ”To out-
siders,- it would appear‘ to change
little at all.”

According to Posvar, the panel
will interview students, faculty,
outsiders and will also review
records.

’’It will be a broad and extend-
ed review,” he said.

Woman
receives
second
liver

By Mark R. Brown

Contributing Editor

Presbyterian-University Hospi-
tal doctors performed a second
liver transplant on Pollie Smolin—
ski yesterday morning due to the
deterioration of her first trans-
planted liver.

According to hospital
spokesperson Susan Ruth, ”Po|-
lie is listed in critical condition,
which is normal following liver
transplants. There are no compli-
cations. She is doing fine, but the
first 48 hours following an oper-
ation are the most critical.”

//T

Pollie was considered
a good risk for surgery
as she was doing fine;
it was the liver which

wasn't.
— Susan Ruth

Smolinski, 26, of Hallie, Ky.,
gained local attention through the
discovery that she and her fami-
ly were living in their truck's cam-
per in a local parking lot while
awaiting her first transplant. They
were subsequently housed in
university dorm space and a lo-
cal apartment.

”What happened was that her
first liver, which she received on
May 26, was doing fine until last
Sunday. The liver began to deteri-

orate,” said Ruth. ”Her surgeon, '

Dr. Robert Gordon, elected to go
ahead with a second transplant
due to Pollie’s strong condition.
Pollie was considered a good risk
for surgery as she was doing fine;
it was the liver which wasn’t.”

Gordon's reaction after the se-
cond transplant was described as
”cautious optimism," which was
how he felt after the first trans-
plant, said Ruth.

Smolinski went into surgery at
4:30 a.m. and remained there un-
til 9:30 a.m. ”The second trans-
plant took half the time of the first
operation, as numerous surgical
steps did not need to be repeat-
ed. As a general statistic, 15 to 20
percent of liver transplants re-
quire a second liver transplant, ”
said Ruth.

Ruth said that most of Pollie’s
family had come to Pittsburgh
from Kentucky to be with her,
and that they were very relieved
at her condition.

South African commandos attack Botswanans

GABORONE, Botswana (AP) —
Security forces arrested two
white, South African soldiers af-
ter a shootout in which South
African commandos injured three
Botswanan policemen, the presi-
dent's office said yesterday.

The statement said the shooting
occurred late Monday when six
unarmed police officers were
fired «at by five South African
commandos who were planning
a raid on a target in Gaborone,
the capital.

South African commandos
have staged numerous cross-
border raids in the past on Bot-
swana and other neighboring
countries to attack suspected
hideouts and bases of the African
National Congress. The ANC is
the main guerrilla movement
fighting South 1 Africa's
government.

said.

The latest bombing was the’

fourth attack attributed to Sikh
separatists since Sunday. At least
52 people, most of them Hindus,
have died in the attacks and more
than 130 have been wounded.

The bomb was hidden inside a
plastic bag in the front part of a
motor scooter parked at the mar-
ket, Arora quoted witnesses as
saying.

Serbjeet Singh, deputy com-
missioner of Amritsar, blamed
neighboring Pakistan for the
bombing. He said he expected
more attacks in Punjab state by
”Pakistani agents.”

Psychiatric records
won't be used in trial

CARROLLTON, Ky. (AP) -
The psychiatric records of the
man charged with capital murd-
er in the May 14 bus crash near
Carrollton that killed 27 people
will remain private, under a rul-
ing by Carroll Circuit Judge
Charles Satterwhite.

Satterwhite denied a prosecu-
tion request Monday to see Larry
Mahoney’s psychiatric records,
despite a prosecutor's claim that
such information is critical to his

case.
”We're looking for anything
that might be relative to his state
of mind and intent,” prosecutor
Paul Richwalsky, an assistant at-
torney general, said in court
Monday. ’

Richwalsky suggested that Sat-
terwhite privately review the
records and decide what can and
cannot be released, but Satter-
white declined, ruling that the
psychiatric records will remain
private.

Mahoney is at the Kentucky
Correctional Psychiatric Center
near La Grange, where he is be-
ing evaluated to see if he is com-
petent for trial.

Mahoney, 35, of Worthville, is
charged with 27 counts of capi-
tal murder for the crash on Inter-
state 71. He was allegedly driving
drunk when his pickup truck,
traveling the wrong way on the
interstate, collided with a Radcliff
church bus, killing 23 teenagers
and three adults.

in a hit-and-run accident has
been hospitalized for depression,
forcing postponement of his
preliminary hearing Tuesday.

The hearing for Paul L. Patchel
was rescheduled to July 6 by Dis-

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, June 22,’ 1988

By Scot Ross

News Editor

In 1967, Presbyterian-
University Hospital surgeon
Dr. Thomas Starzl completed
the first liver transplant at the
University of Denver, Colora-
do. In 1988, his research has
given doctors the means to
offer many a second chance
on life, including graduate Jen-
nifer Hugus.

While attending a wedding
on May 28 of this year, Hugus
became violently ill; an event
she now recognizes as being
”the first sign.”

From there her condition
worsened and on Memorial
Day Hugus sought medical at-
tention in her hometown of
Greensburg.

Blood work was done;
however, the results were
delayed and for her own
benefit, Hugus checked her-
self into Westmoreland Hospi-
tal, diagnosed as having
hepatitis.

‘'1 just got sicker and more
out of it,” she said.

Her recollection of the
events preceding the opera-
tion are hazy though. ’’I real-
ly wasn't good then. I
remember things that hap-
pened when l was in the [in-
tensive care unit], and I
remember coming down here.
Little things. The tests that they
ran me through. But I don't
remember anything what-
soever about talking about a
new liver, until they told me
a couple of hours before the
operation that I needed a new
liver and that they had found
one,” she said.

Hugus’ transplant surgery
was performed on June 10 at
Presby, the emotion of the en-
tire situation registering deeply
with friends and family.

Her father John Hugus said
his reaction was one of shock.
’’It was so fast. Everything hap-
pened so fast. It was being
done as things got worse. I
think the shock still probably
hasn't set in yet.”

Pitt grad recuperates
* after liver transplant

According to Jennifer, her
doctors have stated that her
recovery is coming along very
well.

She said, though, that the
operation has not left her
without a considerable
amount ofdiscomfort. ”l have
my good days, I have my bad
days. I had a lot of bad days
when I first came out.

’’I had a lot of back pain, be-
cause of the way they lay you
on the table. You just ex-
perience some really severe
back pain that has to work its
way out. Your incision hurts
because it's healing,” she
added.

At the present time, Hugus
is going through her rejection
stage, which lasts approxi-
mately 14 days and shows
whether or not the body is ac-
cepting the organ.

’’I’m going through [the] re-
jection [period] right now, and
that is definitely an eye
opener. Because I was fine,
and then ‘boom,’ 1 was down
again,” Hugus stated. She ex-
plained that this is normal
while taking the rejection
medicine.

A native of Greensburg,
John Hugus said, ”We have
friends that are in the process
of starting a fund raiser, but
with the DeSiller’s [incident],
you have to go through the
state. That has not started.
They are going through the
process, but as far as the fund
raising, because the permit
hasn't arrived.”

”We have no idea what it's
going to cost; at this point,
we're not sure,” mother Judy
Hugus said. ”We’re not into
that yet. Eventually we will
be.”

The family expressed great
admiration towards the care
Jennifer received while in
Presby. ”They tell you things.
Sometimes you don't want to
hear them, but they tell you,”
Mrs. Hugus said.

Also, 750 parking spaces will be
available on the the edge of the
Medical School campus.

Mayor Sophie Masloff said that
the entire project's construction
will create 6,000 new construc-
tion related jobs and 1,000 new
permanent jobs.

”By having this-major medical
research center, Pittsburgh resi-
dents can rest assured that they
have the finest medical care avail- ,
able right at their doorstep,” said 1- _ . ‘
Masloff. ”No longer do Pittsbur— 
ghers have to journey to other ci-
ties if they or their loved ones
need specialized care.”

”The money [to fund the
project] comes basically from
bonds from private foundations,
from contributions, and of course
it comes from research funding
provided by the federal govern-
ment,” said Detre.

Detre also said that in the last
five years, federal support for
medical research programs at Pitt
has more than doubled, and that
the medical school has risen from
46th place to 20th place nation-
ally in attaining federal funding.

Masloff said that organizations
involved in the Partnership for
Medical Renaissance presently
contributes $1.3 billion annually
to the Pittsburgh region, and that
this figure will increase to $2.2
billion at the completion of the
project. i

Climbing course offering ‘rocky’ challenges

My mother thought I was nuts.

.My friends all thought I was

stupid. I'm still not quite sure
what I was thinking about when
I registered for Pitt's Basic Rock
Climbing class.

Yes, that's where it all began.
A simple one credit class for
which I actually paid to have the
living tar scared out of me.

The class began with what was
’’simple’’ knot craft, and height-
ened, literally, to monstrous
climbs and invigorating (maybe
even somewhat euphoric)
rappels.

Taught by Larry Westfall and
Skip "Scabass” Tipton, eight of us
traversed the Chestnut Ridge
region of the Laurel Mountains to

learn what some of us dreamed
about and what kept certain
others of us awake at night — free
bouldering, friction pit climbing,
bank and overhang rappelling.

The experience was, in a word,
challenging, like nothing I've
ever done before. Motivation,
strength and sheer will power
forced me up toward the top of
"Chickenhead” and then down
to the depths of the ravine.

HEIDI
WHITE

There was one episode in par-
ticular that I won't soon forget.
We were learning a type of des-
cent that was comparable to
something Groucho Marx would
do — basically walking feet first
off of a l50—foot ledge. Gene,
Phil, Duane, John and I had all
accomplished this twice (the
usual number for each stunt).

We all followed Larry's

number—one rule: "Never let go
of the rope with your right hand.
It's the only thing keeping you
from kissing the dirt.”

I was having a great time, so
me and my big mouth asked to
go again. After I was harnessed
in, good old Larry practically
pushed me off the top only to yell
a couple of seconds later: '’All—
right, girly  now, stop!” No
problem. I pulled my right break
arm in and came to an easy halt.

Skip bellowed up to me at 75
feet: "Heidi, do you trust me?”

At the time I didn't even know
his name, but all too quickly I
said, "Sure," without thinking.
And before I knew it, the only
rope attached to me was torn
from my right hand (My mother
always told me to never trust a
man).

Nevertheless, I slid at a decent‘

pace down the line to safely

place my feet on the ground. I ac— Q

tually thought I was going to die.
None of us had any idea that Skip
could control our speed and, for
that matter, our destiny from the
bottom. -We were told we were
completely on our own.

The class went climbing on
three seperate occasions: June
11, 12 and 18. Because I was the
only female who attended all

three sessions, I was the butt of

many chauvinistic jokes. For ex—""

ample, before we entered the
woods for the first, time Larry
loaded all the guys with packs
and helmets and 200—foot blue-
water rope. He only gave me
what looked like a drawstring
from a pair of old sweatpants. I
sarcastically thanked him for
sparing me the possibility of
breaking a fingernail, grabbed a
bag, rope and helmet, and head-
ed back the trail.

I thought of the position I was
in with six guys whom I had
never met, walking among the
trees to an unknown destination.
Almost anything could happen.
So I literally walked myself right
into an insult when I asked Skip

course. ”You don't want to
know," he replied. I never sensed
the sarcasm. Boy, did I feel like
a dizzy blond.

Yes, I felt stupid. But I don't
think I felt as stupid as Susan did
when she mistook a rol|ed—up
piece of old carpet for a coiled
snake in the crack of a rock. We
referred to this episode later as
"The rural carpet snake double
take." Needless to say, Susan
never made the last class.

I did what I had to do — fear,
or no fear, female or not —- I did
it and I enjoyed it. My muscles
are still sore and I could sure use
a back rub, but given the chance,
I'd do it all again. And again.

-.Iran-Contra trials
  widen their scope

On Monday, the federal grand jury headed by special prose-
cutor Lawrence Walsh issued an indictment against former CIA
agent Joseph F. Fernandez, charging him with knowingly mis-
leading his superiors in connection with his knowledge of an
airstrip in Costa Rica. Fernandez, who was dismissed from the
agency for similar charges, was also accused in the Tower Com-
mission Report of withholding information and obstructing a

federal inquiry.

To date, Walsh has kept a remarkably low profile, despite
the serious setbacks he has encountered. Last week, each of
the four defendants, former Lt. Col. Oliver North, Richard
Secord, Albert Hakim and Admiral John Poindexter, were grant-
ed seperate trials to ensure their Fifth Amendment rights.

For Walsh, that move means he will be unable to ”present
a clear picture of the whole operation, with all the participants
present” for the jury. In essence, the quality of Walsh's home-

work will be tested.

It is encouraging to see that a member of the intelligence com-
munity is being brought to trial for what is certainly a breach
of public trust. It indicates at least a tacit agreement on the part
of the CIA to cooperate with the Department oflustice. Which
is just what Americans would like to see more of in their govern-
ment. Cooperation, rather than covert operation.

Defense spending out of line

I find it incredible that the Pen-
tagon is building a fleet of
$15,000 fake jet fighters and
$3,500 fake tanks designed to
draw enemy fire away from the
real thing (according to an article
on May 8).

Has U.S. Air Force Intelligence
failed to inform the Pentagon of
the Soviet installation of radar
units and ABMs in multiple num-
bers in direct violation of the
ABM Treaty? [...] The treaty was
meant to enhance super-power
stability by keeping each nation
vulnerable to the attacking mis-
siles of the other. [...] But if one
side had a ballistic missile
defense and the other did not, un-
der certain circumstances the side
which was defended might
launch a first strike or use its
unilateral advantage to blackmail
the other. [...]

The Soviets may be currently

LETTERS

mass-producing ABMs; one piece
of evidence is that they have re-
cently doubled the floor space at
their Gomel plant, which
produces ABM components. [...]
It is reasonable to conclude that
the increased production capac-
ity is associated with a gradual
progressive breakout of the ABM
Treaty. [...]

There is no reason for the USSR
to increase their capabilities in
this manner unless they expect to
launch a nuclear first strike and,
therfore, must be prepared to
receive a retaliatory strike. It is es-
timated that the previously com-
pleted systems can be netted
together with the newly
produced units in a year or less.

And what do we have in place

to counter this vast array of prepa-
ration? We have little defense
against the Soviet intent because
the American government and
the American people have been
lulled to sleep by Mikhail Gor-
bachev’s promises of peace and
friendship. They have failed to
see the clear and present danger
to this country, preferring to be-
Iieve that ”all is well,’’ and that
world peace is progressing. Peace
without freedom and honor is an.
empty victory! When, in the
course of human history, has a
nation ever preserved its freedom .
without impregnable defense?

And what is the Pentagon do-
ing about all of this? It's planning
to spend millions of dollars on
decoys to protect conventional
jets and tanks.

Democracy is more_thar1a position to support

Yesterday, I attended a meeting
of a local municipal council. One
of my duties as an aspiring jour-
nalist is to inform the public of
the actions of various governing
bodies.

At first glance, this is not the
most glamorous of occupations.
I sometimes find myself confront-
ed by angry people with
problems I haven't had the time
to fully understand. It is my
responsibility, hopefully, to make
some sense of both sides of the
argument, and to present that ar-
gument to interested people who
couldn't be at the meeting.

It isn't glamorous all that often,
and to be honest, there is a small
amount of outright boredom as-
sociated with the job. There is,
however, something to be said
for gaining a bit of first hand
knowledge of this piece of polit-
ical thought called democracy,
an idea whose power has proven
itself in countless wars.

As a college student, and a rela-
tive newcomer to. the set of
problems which passes for cur-
rent politics, I have found myself
usually confronted by commen-
tary and reflection about a
problem before I have had a
chance to experience it. I have sat
in classes where the govern-
ment’s structure was discussed,

where the various powers given
to local, state and federal govern-
ments were outlined, but that sort
of knowledge is a poor cousin to
a little direct experience;

Abbie Hoffman, a well—known
activist of Chicago Seven fame,
once passed on an exceptionally
clear description of democracy
he had heard from his father.
Democracy, the elder man said,
is not a place to hang your hat,
it is not a thing to believe or to
disbelieve, to agree with or to
doubt. Democracy is a thing to
do, or not to do. It is a set of ac-
tions, a way of interacting with a
government, a process. As soon
as we forget this, Hoffman's
father warned, we slip into the
mired realm of dogma.

In these classrooms, we discuss
democracy. On the various patri-
otic holidays, we discuss our
gratitude to those who have died
ostensibly for our deomcracy.
When we take a position con-
cerning the military, we discuss
our own willingness to die for this
democracy. But, sitting in those
council meetings, watching the
faces in the audience month to
month, I see something that
speaks a little different of
democracy.

I see that people don't, for the
most part, attend their local

MATTHEW
THORNTON

government's public meetings. I
see the signs of this implied
aristocracy in the elected officials
in whom the people have left
their trust. Without constant input
from the public, the elected
members of a council begin to as-

.sume that it is they who make the

decisions, rather than the consti-
tuents. They begin to act, by

default since they have no other
guidance, as if they actually are

the governemnt. That they are the
power, and they are the hand
balancing lives.

I do not mean to say that the
officials are even partly to blame
for this. They have taken on pow-
er because there was no one else.
The people have not been
stripped of their right to speak,
they have lost it to lack of prac-
tice. A glance at even the voter
registration, the most basic
responsibility of any citizen in a
democracy, will confirm that the
people have decided on their si-
lence, it has not been forced.

In the meetings I attend, I have
begun to see the effect of a silent
majority. Decisions are made on

incomplete information. Mem-
bers of the public lose opportu-
nities to have their cases heard
because of missed deadlines.

In our classrooms, I hear of the
people, the citizens. It is their
postulated needs that serve as
justification for most legislation.
Yet, inlthese local meetings, at
this most immediate level of
government, I wonder who these
people are. I do not see them. In
a township whose population is
nearly 30,000, there are meetings
attended by less than 10 people.
To ask where the masses are
seems ludicrous. To ask about
even a representative sample
makes little sense.

The people are home, instinct

tells me. They are watching tele-
vision, eating dinner, talking to
each other, making plans. These
people, these people so god-
damned proud of their veterans,
so grateful for the blood spilled
on their behalf, are too busy,
have too many problems, to use
the service whose fees are col-
lected in flesh.

And so I wonder. I wonder
about the future of this process
we have called democracy. I
wonder about this country,
where the government of the
people is a mystery and a foreign-
er to their majority.

spective editor of The Pitt News.

This year's crop of  
NBA draft selections

unappetizing at best    

By John Enright and
Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writers

For the first time in the history
—— as in,”What years did the bu-
bonic plague ravage Europe?” -—
of the National Basketball Associ-
ation's annual draft lottery, the
team with the absolute low-
down, dirtiest, dead—skunk—in—the-
middle—of-the—road regular season
record finds itself holding the
winning ticket, and thus, the
rights to the first pick in the col-
legiate draft.

And luckily for the Los Angeles
Clippers, for if the lottery gods
(no, not Nick Perry) who shuffled
the deck had purposely dealt out
its typical bad hand, the Clips, in
terms of future all-stars, would
have found themselves with what
the other 23 selectors basically
have to fight over.

Leftovers.

”So soon?” the league
wonders. ”Why we haven't even
finished the appetizers yet, and
you're talking about what’s for
dinner tomorrow!”

Appetizer, gents, appetizer.
The singular. After Kansas for-
ward Danny Manning, whom the
Clippers gobbled up as soon as
he was served, what remains
available after the first seven
picks looks almost like what
you'd likely find on the roster of
an above—average CBA team.

Granted, more than a few of
the players taken will find full-

, time places on their respective

rosters, but that number is going

to be unusually high this year be- 7

cause of the league's expansion
draft. NBA franchises are allowed
to protect only eight players on
its rosters, and whoever remains
unprotected is fair game for the
Charlotte Hornets and the Miami
Heat, the league's two new ex-
pansion clubs, to pick up. Call it
the NBA’s rummage sale. Or a
old—fashioned house
cleaning.

But to replace the old guys you
ship out, you gotta bring new
guys in to replace them. It be-
comes a guessing game. And the
further down the list you go, the
best teams can hope for is to pull
a Dennis Rodman-type out of the
grab bag. Or maybe get really
lucky, like the New York Knicks

Despite

”Once and for All”: that's how
they are promoting the fight on
Monday night between Mike Ty-
son and Michael Spinks.

In one corner, you have a tele-
vision actress and her mother
who, at first glance, both seem to

be married to the champ. Then

there is Don King, the ever-
present promoter.

In the other corner you have
Butch Lewis, he of the tuxedo,
bow tie and suspenders with no
shirt. Good, now that we have
gotten past the hype, we can look
at the real issue, that being how
much of a mismatch this fight
really is.

Quick now, a hot dog at the

did last season, when they closed
their eyes, reached in, and came
up with Mark Jackson, the new
holder of the NBA’s rookie assist
mark.

This is how we forsee the selec-
tions in the 1988 NBA draft:

1. Los Angeles Clippers —-
Danny Manning, 6—foot-1 1, Kan-
sas. Teams have been drooling
over this guy for the last two
years. Best player available, no
question.

2. Indiana — Rik Smits, 7-4,
Marist. The Pacers can't pass up
the best center in the draft, since
they don't have one to begin
with. Steve Stipanovich, who
plays there now, is really a for-
ward in center's clothing. Back-
ups Greg Dreiling and Stuart
Gray haven't done the job.

3. Philadelphia —- Hersey
Hawkins, 6-3, Bradley. The Six-
ers plan on phasing out streaky
and oft-injured guard Andrew
Toney, so they'll need a shooter
to take scoring burden off Charles
Barkley. Hawkins can fill the
spot.

4. New Jersey — Will Perdue,
7-0, Vanderbilt. The Nets’ last
selection from the Southeast Con-
ference was Jeff Turner, a 6-9
member of the 1984 U.S. Olym-
pic team, who burst like a water
balloon in the NBA. Powerless
New Jersey hopes Perdue will
provide much-needed bulk.

5. Golden State —- Charles
Smith, 6-10, Pittsburgh. The War-
riors and head coach/GM Don
Nelson followed Smith closely all
year. Nelson told‘Pitt coach Paul
Evans that he wanted Smith. He'll
get him, too. '

6. Los Angeles Clippers (from
Sacramento) — Gary Grant, 6-3,
Michigan. With Manning, the
Clips draft is made. Now they
need a quality athlete to get him
the ball, and to provide some
scoring punch of his own. Grant
is the man.

7. Phoenix —- Rony Seikaly,
6-11, Syracuse. The Suns’ roster
has nearly been wiped out by
scandal and poor draft selections.
Looking toward the future, Phoe-
nix is hoping the inconsistent but
talented Seikaly will be the rock
on which they can build.

8. Charlotte -7- Tim Perry, 6-9,
Temple. Perry has impressed
scouts in the league's pre—draft

workouts, although he was over-
shadowed by teammates Howard
Evans and Mark Macon in col-
lege. He is a defensive expert
who will help the Hornets in the
future.

9. Miami —Rex Chapman, 6-5,
Kentucky. Surprise pick number
one. One NBA scout told The Pitt
News he thought Chapman was
the most overrated player in the
country. As far as several other
teams in the league are con-
cerned, Chapman is ready.

10. San Antonio — Chris Mor-
ris, 6-8, Auburn. Some NBA

scouts think he’ll be better than
former Tiger terror Charles Bark-
ley. That might be going a bit far,
but he should compliment David
Robinson well a few years down
the road.

11. New York — Harvey
Grant, 6-8, Oklahoma. The
Knicks desperately need scoring
help from the forward position,
since Kenny Walker has failed to
develop. Harvey is the brother of
Horace Grant, who performed
impressively for the Chicago
Bulls as a rookie last season. He
should blend in well with Mark

hype, Tyson should be t

Original (at the expense of The
Pitt News) for the person who
can tell me the names of the op-
ponents in Spinks’ four fights as
a heavyweight. You can't, can
you? That is because he has not
fought anyone of any sig-
nificance.

Spinks is 4-0 as a heavyweight,
but that includes two wins over
an old and ‘way over the hill Lar-
ry Holmes. Also on record for
Spinks was his victory against
”The Great White Dope,” Gerry
Cooney, whose only claim to
fame was being beaten up by Lar-
ry Holmes.

Spinks has also fought Steffen
Tangstad who was ranked some-

TONI
ZUCK

where around 245 when he got
into the ring, 275 when he got
out of the ring.

Spinks has an impressive
record of 31-0 with 21 knock-
outs, but the quality fights came
against light-heavyweights such
as Marvin Johnson, Eddie Musta-
fa Muhammad and Dwight Mu-
hammad Qawi.

Tyson has been in seven title
fights en route to a 34-0 record
with 30 knockouts, and of those

seven title fights only the wipeout

of Tyrell Biggs has not been.

against a world champ or
ex-champ.

Age may also be a factor in this
fight. Spinks is 31 years old‘ and
he has been fighting as a pro
since he won a gold medal at the
1976 Olympics. Tyson will be
only 22 three days after the fight.

At his young age, Tyson has not
yet reached his peak and he im-
proves every fight —- that also in-
cludes the patience department,
which’ means that Tyson will not
get worn out if he has to chase

Spinks for the first couple rounds. ,

Everywhere you look, people
are saying that Spinks is just so

Jackson and Pat Ewing.

12. Washington —- Mark
Bryant, 6-9, Seton Hall. Surprise
pick number two. The feeling
here is that monstrous Bryant is
underrated. After playing college
ball in the physical Big East, he
should easily adapt to rugged
Eastern Conference play.

13. Milwaukee — Mitch Rich-
mond, 6-5, Kansas State. The
Bucks are looking to replace the
aging Sidney Moncrief at off-
guard. Richmond, out of the
physical Big Eight, will love itin

e victor

awkward and that will give Tyson
fits, but a few years ago that was
what people were saying about
Tyson. People will also say that
Spinks has been able to pepper

his heavyweight foes with quick

shots to the head.

He won't be able to do that this
fight because he's facing some-
one who is one of the best defen-
sive fighters to come along in
years. Actually, Tyson has never
been cut as a pro.

It seems to me that everywhere
you look there is a story about
this fight.‘ Every big star wants to
be there and be seen there, but
the media blitz does not change

Draft  

Continued from page 6

the rough Central Division.

14. Phoenix (from Cleveland)
-— Jeff Grayer, 6-5, Iowa State.
Phoenix is using the same draft
philosophy as the Clippers: pick
up the big man inside, then draft
a perimeter threat. The Suns left
one-time super scorer Walter Da-
vis unprotected for the expansion
draft.

15. Seattle — Jose Vargas,
6-10, LSU. The Sonics could use
some bulk to go with all the scor-
ing machines that lurk in the Pa-
cific Northwest. His inconsistent
performances in college hides his
enormous potential.

16. Houston — Ricky Berry,
6-8, San Jose State. The Rockets
traded for point—man Eric Floyd
last season and are now in search
of a shooting guard (where Floyd
should be in the first place). Little-
known Berry is extremely versa-
tile, the type of player Houston
likes.

17. Utah —— Derrick Chievous,
6-7, Missouri. A standard
Western Conference ballplayer,
he loves to shoot, and does it
well. The Jazz need more scoring
from the perimeter.

18. Atlanta — Eric Leckner,
6-1 1, Wyoming. A good shooter,
and center Tree Rollins has seen
too many miles with the Hawks.

19. Chicago — Dean Garrett,
6-10, Indiana. The Bulls are in
desperate need of a physical
center, so they'll take their
chances. They probably won't
find one in Garrett, a first-rate
Brad Sellers—clone.

20. Dallas — Willie Anderson,

6-7, Georgia. He can play both .

backcourt positions and swing-
man. Mavs will need his flexibil-

  

ity if Aguirre and his sour attitude
are traded.

21. Portland — Rod Strickland,
6-1, DePaul. The Blazers need
backcourt help. Strickland is great
in transition, and speedwise, he
can motor with the best.

22. Cleveland (from Detroit
via Phoenix) — Jerome Lane, 6-6,
Pittsburgh. Lane is an outstanding
rebounder, and the Cavs need
help in that area if they are going
to contend with Detroit in the
Central. His shooting skills, and
possibly his attitude, are the only
drawbacks. He's a hometown
pick for Cleveland, being from
Akron.

23. Denver — Shelton Jones,
6-9, St. John's. Jones should team
up well with Nuggets point guard

Michael Adams, another Big East
alumnus. Jones loves to run the
court, and Denver will love that.

24. Boston —— Everette
Stephens, 6-2, Purdue. The Cel-
tics need backcourt help. Dennis
Johnson, whether Auerbach be-
lieves it or not, is getting old.
Stephens’ talents were dimmed
by all the big names_at Purdue
this past season.

25. Los Angeles Lakers —
Michael Anderson, 5-11, Drexel.
Magic Johnson isn't young any-
more, but he’s not ready to retire
either. Still, the Lakers aren't go-
ing to get quality back-up help
from Wes Matthews or Milt
Wagner. Unknown Anderson is
the best pure point guard in the
draft.

the fact that Spinks does not have
a legitimate claim to the
heavyweight championship. He
was stripped of his title for pull-
ing out of the HBO tournament
after Tyson burst onto the scene.

Maybe Spinks is the best fight-
er to date that Tyson has faced.
So what? That doesn't matter. He
will not be able to slow the
champ down.

Every night, Tyson goes to
sleep and dreams that he is
watching himself box. That is not
so surprising when you realize
that it is boxing that kept him out

The surprising thing is that the
result of each fight is the same ev-
ery time. Tyson loses, and that
fact alone keeps him sharp and
on edge. That is what is needed
when you are a fighter. You need
a fear of losing. And it doesn't
hurt that he likes to beat people
up, either. I

If you are betting on the fight,
take Tyson from round four to
seven by knockout. The ”Spinks
Jinx” will not land with any
authority, and this time Spinks is
fighting a heavyweight who will
fight back.

Paralympics athlete
striving for Seoul '88

Text By Matt Martin

For The Pitt News

Competing in the Olympics is
a dream for most people, a dream
that becomes reality for only a
very few. Those few dedicate
themselves to this goal and work
for years for the right and honor
to represent their country in the
greatest international assembly
the world knows.

Pittsburgh native Tom Cush is
such a person, but definitely not
just your average athlete. Cush,
26, was born with cerebral palsy
and is confined to a wheelchair.
But while a disability such as this
would hinder most people, it has
opened up new windows of op-
portunity for Cush.

For the past seven‘years, Cush,
the youngest of 12 children, has
competed in national and inter-
national competitions, winning
more than 50 medals, setting
numerous national records in
track events and twice being
named to Team USA.

But Cush, a 1983 dual gradu—
ate of Langley High School and
Pioneer Center School earned his

greatest honor last July when he
finished second in the Can Am
Pacific Games on Long Island,
New York and earned a spot on
the USA Paralympics Team.

Cush is in the class two lower-
section of the games, meaning
that he uses his feet to propel
himself. He has no control over
his arms and only limited control
of his head.

But Cush is also facing a harsh
reality. Although he is officially a
member of the team, Cush is the
first alternate on the team which
will travel to Seoul. Unless some-
thing happens to David Osborne,
the athlete who placed first in the
Can Am Games, or an opening in
another class opens up, Cush
may never see Seoul.

Osborne supposedly represents
America's best chance to bring
home gold medals in the Games.
Gene Brickley, Cush’s coach and
a Citipark Therapeutic Rehabili-
tation Department coach, thinks
differently. ’’If they want to bring
home a medal, I think Tom's the
athlete to beat.

”He’s had a change of equip-

would have beaten [Osborne],”
Brickley said.’

"In the past six months, he's
turned in phenomenal times. I'm
going to write a letter to the com-_
mittee and send in his times,”
Brickely continued.

The Games are constantly on
Cush’s mind. ”To get to Seoul, to

g'get to the Games — I'm really

working hard at it. I hired some-

with me every day,” Cush said.

But Cush faces more than just
the problem of getting to Seoul —
funding for the possible trip is
another. Each athlete on the dis-
abled team (there are three from
Pittsburgh) must raise $3,500 to
pay for expenses.

”We’re doing everything we
possibly can to raise money,”
said Pittsburgh Goal Getters pro-
gram coordinator Sandy Reed.

D. And Cush is doing everything

he can to further his cause, which
began in 1981.

”I did so well in the local
games that I qualified for the Na-

tional Rhode Island Games,"
Cush said. ’’I won two medals, a
gold and a bronze. I was very
suprised.”

But surprise has turned into
pride and diligence since that first
meet. Cush now works out five
days a week, two-and-a-half
hours a day at Mt. Lebanon High
School. The plaques, medals and
medallions that hang from his liv-
ing room walls can attest to what
this training has brought him.

”I can't help it I'm so good,”
Cush joked.

”It’s phenomenal, his attitude,
said Brickley. ”An able—bodied
person would probably slow
down if he knew he wasn't going
 but it's made him work that
much harder.”

Cush admits it is not easy at
times. ”The hardest thing about
training is sometimes the heat.
You want to keep going, but the
heat just gets to you,” Cush said.
”But it's fun trying to win. I like
to keep moving. I don't like to sit
still. I love to train for the Games.
It really keeps me going.”

Cush competes in no less than
four events, including the 100,

200, 400 and 800 meter compe-
ﬁﬁons

The competitions present Cush
with opportunities many people
will never have. He has traveled
to much of the world, including
Denmark, Edmonton and
Ontario.

Publicity runs very low for
events such as this, but that may
all change this year. “This is the
year to do that as the Olympic
Committee is behind us. It's a big
step towards recognition,” said
Reed.

Publicity may not be the most
important thing in Cush’s life,
though. He would prefer to go
about his business like any other
human being. But his disability,
or more accurately, the ignorance
of others about his disability
sometimes stands in the way.

"I have total control over my
feet," said Cush, who goes
barefoot around the house. ’’I
write and type with them.”

”And he takes his wheelchair
apart with hisfeet,” said Dorothy
Cush, Tom's mother. ”He has a
great mechanical aptitude.”

But that aptitude has only car-
ried Cush so far. ”Tom was work-
ing for a vocational rehabilitation
center for a while, but was laid
off,” said Mrs. Cush, a Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh School of Social
Work graduate.

”No one would hire me,"
Cush said.

”He’s perfectly willing to do
anything else, but they [employ-
ers] seem to be afraid that he
won't be able to do everything
with his feet.

So to occupy his free time,
Cush works on his own wheel-
chairs. Of the three he owns, Mrs.
Cush said at least one of them is

almostalways lying in pieces on“

floor of Tom's room.

Cush has other dreams besides
the Olympics. ”One job Iwould
like would be as a wheelchair
repairman, or maybe I'll try to go
to college.”

Neither is too far out of reali-
ty’s grasp. With what Cush has
achieved thus far, nothing is out
of the question.
