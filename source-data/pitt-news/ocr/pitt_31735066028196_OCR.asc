Union campaign continues

By Anthony Breznican
Staff Writer ‘

The effort to unionize has gained
momentum among Pitt’s faculty recently.

Members of United Faculty, an unoffi-
cially recognized organization of Pitt fac-
ulty members, have been campaigning
for approval to file with the Pennsylvania
Labor Board to form a contract union.

“Thirty percent [of faculty approval] is
the minimum number required by the
Pennsylvania Labor Board in order for
the group to file for an election,” said
United Faculty President Mark Ginsburg.
“We’re about at the point of being able to
ﬁle.”

However, the United Faculty plans to
hold off on ﬁling until at least 60 percent
of faculty members approve the United
Faculty as their representative for collec-

tive bargaining.

“We set, as a goal, 60 percent of the
faculty signing cards indicating that they
want to have the election,” Ginsburg said.
“We want to have a strong level of sup-
port before we move into the legal, and
other, processes involved.”

Ginsburg said he hopes to reach that
goal sometime within the academic
semester.

There have been three past campaigns
to unionize since the mid-’70s, but none
of the efforts passed the approval of the
faculty.

Several issues inﬂuenced the current
movement to unionize.

“There’s no place where faculty can sit
down with the administration as equals,”
Ginsburg said.

The unilateral decisions by the admin-

Kevin Cecil
fund grows

By Nicole Walz
Staff Writer

Pitt senior Kevin Cecil was shot and paralyzed
on July 13, 1995. He now is in a Mechanicsburg
rehabilitation center and is expected to be there
until the end of the year. Cecil also has new
expenses that his family isn’t able to handle alone.
It is expected that it will cost $400,000 each year
to maintain all of Cecil’s everyday needs.

However, since the day he was shot, a growing
number of Pitt students have come together to
work on fundraising activities for him. A six—per—
son committee, the Kevin Cecil Benefit Fund
Committee, was developed to head the projects in
the university community.

Now the Student Government Board is working
to promote various fund raising events, which
were originated by the Cecil committee. One
event occurred at Midnight Madness this past
Saturday, during which the committee collected
money from attending students. SGB president
Julie Crowell reported that this event raised $560
for Cecil.

“On Sunday, when we told him_ how much
money was raised at Midnight Madness, he got a
huge smile on his face,” said Meegan Galie, one
of the co—chairs of the Cecil committee. “Thank
you to all the students who have contributed.”

The Engineering Student Council has donated
$1,000 to the beneﬁt fund as well. While at Pitt,
Cecil majored in engineering.

“Other expenses for Kevin will be a specialized
van that will cost $50,000 plus renovations,”
Galietsaid. “His family will also need to make
renovations to their house to accommodate him.”

Cecil’s new specialized wheelchair will cost
approximately $10,000.

It’s because of the thousands of dollars needed
that the committee and SGB are calling for stu-
dents to help out. One way students can help is to
start collecting aluminum cans which will be
recycled for money. The committee will

Iranian-backed guerillos kill six Israelis

JERUSALEM —_ Iranian-
backed guerillas in southern
Lebanon are responsible for the
deaths of six Israeli soldiers and
the serious injury of another in a
bloody day of warfare that fur-
ther blocks peace in the Middle
East.

The attack was launched as an
Israeli patrol truck ran over an
explosive charge and is slated as
the deadliest explosion this year
in the border zone of southern
Lebanon occupied by Israeli
troops;

The militant Islamic group
Hezbollah, or Party of God,
claimed responsibility for the
attacks. It brought the number of
Israeli soldiers killed in the
Lebanon this year to 22, more

than the 21 soldiers killed over-
all last year. Pittsburgh Post-

Pitt looks
at dorm
proposals

By Julian Neiser
Senior Staff Writer

University officials are
currently evaluating propos-
als to construct a new dor-
mitory on Fifth Avenue.

Under the Master Space
Plan, new priority has been
placed on housing Pitt
undergrad and graduate stu-
dents. A

John DeVitto, senior
vice-chancellor for busi-
ness and finance, said
he has received four pro-
posals for a dormitory
that would be located
across the street from the
Public Health building in
the old Burger King loca-
tion.

“We are considering
the location and the several
proposals we have

received,” DeVitto said.
“We will make our decision
with the best intentions,
and hopefully it will work
out in everyone’s best inter-
ests.”

The Master Space Plan
calls for additional housing
for 2,200 students within a
10-year time frame, and 50
percent of this housing
should be completed within
five years of the plan.

According to the plan, Pitt
currently houses 4,367
undergraduate students in
four on—campus residency
complexes, and 176 gradu-
ate students in the Ruskin
Hall apartments. A

In addition, Pitt maintains
213 off-campus housing
units for graduate students
in Oakland and 144 units‘in
Shadyside.

The plan suggests a new
shift in priorities to find
more on-campus housing
for graduate students. In a
recommendation listed in
the plan, 2,500new spaces
are suggested for Pitt stu-
dents, with 450 going to
undergrads and 2,050 to
grads.

DeVitto said that there is
progress being made, but he
couldn’t speculate when
construction would occur. ‘

“We would like to do it as
soon as possible,” DeVitto
said. “But again, we have to
consider all interests to
make this a success.”

He props the bike up at an angle on the rack and spins the
raised wheel, tinkering with the chain and the spokes. He
keeps working while he talks to a man posed atop a bike and
another on foot, smiling and joking good-naturedly. When the
visitors leave, they are still laughing amiably with him as he
continues to realign the wheel.

He is Jim Brose, the bicycle repairman who has set up shop
on the corner of Forbes and Bigelow, in front of the William
Pitt Union.

“I’ve been a mechanic in bike shops for three years now,”
Brose said. “I noticed that Oakland had the largest community
of bike riders and didn’t have a bike shop. So I thought I’d
give it a try.”

He has been on that corner periodically since the semester
began. In the past, he has worked at shops in Squirrel Hill,
Shadyside and Point Breeze. Not surprisingly, most of his
customers are Pitt students, but Brose said he was surprised at
how good the response has been.

Fortunately for Brose, he was able to get a veteran’s dis-
count on the vending permit required to set up business on the
corner. "

“If I had to shell out 400 bucks, I probably wouldn’t be

3

here,” he said.

His card reads, in bright pink lettering, “Bike Doctor,” and
he can heal almost anything that doesn’t require metal-cut-
ting. He gives complete tune—ups and does part replacement,
including brakes and cables. He stresses the need to take care
of small problems right away.

Before getting into repairs, Brose was an area bicycle mes-
sengen

“After you break everything once, you learn how to fix it,”
he said. ‘‘I’ve collected all my tools slowly over the years.”

As he prepares to close shop for the day, he twists a few
bolts and folds up his repair rack. He throws parts into black
duffel bags full of plastic bags with wires and tools and takes
down the cloth sign that reads, “Bike Repair” in thin, red let-
ters. He rolls up his black material hanging tool kit and packs
everything up in the trailer attached to his bike. .

“I’m the only bicycle—mobile bike shop,” he said. “This is
the best of both worlds. I liked being a bike messenger,
because it was outside. I liked working on bikes, but it was
inside. So Ijust invented my own job.”

Starting soon, it will be a rather chilly work place for the
man in green shorts and a tie—dyed T-shirt. The sweaters and
jackets will get piled on top of each other. Before too long,
the snow will start, but Brose has a plan.

ball games.

Banks, who has a toll—free number, could
not be reached for comment. But his field is
a growing market filled with similar “gam—
bling advisers,” who place advertisements in
the Pittsburgh Post—Gazette and sometimes
in The Pitt News. The call is usually the only
thing that’s free.

Like Pittsburgh’s Steve Livingston, who
calls himself Sky.

“I will give all callers tonight’s game
absolutely free,” reads one of his recent ads.

After a series of phone calls and back-
ground checks, Sky will get on the phone

Jim and his roommate Pete had bet on
John Elway and the Broncos to beat the
Chiefs. The betting line was one point, given
to Kansas City, so all Denver had to do was
win and Jim and Pete would win over $200.

In the fourth quarter, with under two min-
utes to play, Elway led a last-minute drive,
iced off with what appeared to be a game-
winning touchdown. Only one minute and 18
seconds remained in the game.

Minutes later, a shocked Jim sat motion-
less as Joe Montana led the Chiefs down the
field for a last—second touchdown. Pete was
talking on the telephone to his bookie, and
after the touchdown, he launched the phone
across the room, smashing it off the wall.

But for Jim, getting deeper in debt, it was
another restless Monday night.

shells out $150 on “There’s always a concern that

Then, the sky’s the

Monday Night
g Football

The bookie

Mike doesn’t
consider himself a
“true” bookkeeper, or
a “bookie.” He just
does the work for the
people that have big-

—“Mike” ger connections. The
Pitt senior, 21, is
Pitt student bookie their Oakland con-

nection.

For over 20 years, ABC—TV has been tele-
casting a weekly NFL game, and as its popu-
larity has grown, so has the amount of peo-
ple that bet on it.

“It was my savior some of the time,” Jim
says about the weekly nationally televised
football game every Monday.

He was fresh off a losing weekend when
Banks told him “Dallas is a lock to beat
Detroit tonight.” The betting line was over
10 points, so the Cowboys would have to
dominate the game.

Jim, down over $150 on lost bets for the
weekend, tried to bring his debt up to even.
Instead, it was upset night as Detroit pulled
off one of the biggest surprises of the sea-
son.

During the game, Jim put off a term paper
he should have been working on. He was too
enticed by the bet, too interested in the out-
come of the game to do anything else.

Monday Night Football usually showcases
the best teams, and the contest can be harder
to pick, like last year’s Denver Bronco-
Kansas City Chief game on Oct. 17.

“Last year I had about 15 to 20 people bet-
ting through me regularly,” Mike says. “This
year I have eight regulars.” .

Overall, Mike says his bosses don’t like
dealing with students. They prefer “richer
people.” But last year enough students gam-
bled through Mike for him to make $5,000.
That’s enough money to pay for his tuition
for a semester and have enough left over for
some Pittsburgh Steeler tickets. ‘

Despite the lucrative possibilities, Mike
says he wouldn’t even “consider booking
after graduation.”

The fear of getting caught by police lurks
in the back of Mike’s mind, although not
enough to slow him down.

“There’s always a concern that you can get
caught,” he says. “You just can’t be stupid.”

have also made some faculty
strongly believe in the need for
a contract.

“The defined responsibilities
and rights of the faculty can be
spelled out in a contract recog-
nized by the state,” said
University Senate President
Keith McDufﬁe.

Some have seen the need for
empowerment as necessary
because of the purely advisory
capabilities of recognized
groups like the Faculty
Assembly and Senate.

“Nothing of what we agree to
at the university about our sta-
tus or rights as faculty under the
Senate has legal status,”
McDuffie said.

Ginsburg said he feels the
association between the faculty
and administration has affected
faculty morale. This is a time
when faculty members need to
join together, he 

“I think there are a lot of fac-
ulty who have‘ become discour-
aged and cynical about trying to
do something at the university,”
Ginsburg said. “We can’t just
crawl into our offices and

REVIEW

 

O pinions
Remember the students

You should all remember waiting anxiously the night before
first grade was supposed to start praying, “Please, God, let them
be on strike!” When the newscaster finally brought the good
news, you brought out every toy you had and threw it on the
floor in preparation for an extended summer vacation.
(Meanwhile, of course, your parents sat weeping at the prospect
of having you home for another minute.)

Last year, two decisions by the University of Pittsburgh admin-
istration proved that faculty opinion is not given the weight_it
deserves. Former chancellor Dennis O’Connor decided to move
to a one—carrier health plan after the faculty voted almost unani-
mously to keep both HealthAmerica and Blue Cross/Blue Shield
plans. Then the University Planning and Budget Committee insti-
tuted a salary freeze which affected all faculty members.

There is little doubt that the faculty deserves more attention
than the lip service they now enjoy from the administration. And

some of the faculty has taken a "step toward getting that attention.
There is presently a move to unionize the university’s faculty in

order to make the administration hear what the faculty has to say.‘ '

The message that the faculty needs to send to the administra-
tion (if they want to be taken seriously) is one of unity. If the fac-
ulty unionizes together and negotiates with the administration for
a contract, there is no way the administration can ignore what the
faculty wants or brush it off with a condescending shrug.

The problem with a unionized faculty, though, is one which
students need to concern themselves with. This is not elementary
school anymore, and though many of us experience post-summer
depression for a few days, we still pay a lot of money to be here.
It would be devastating for classes to be delayed or postponed for
any length of time. -

Even though the faculty who are supporting United Faculty
claim that they will remain committed to “avoiding strike action
until the last possible" avenue is explored and found not to wor ”
(The Pitt News, May 10, 1995), that does not preclude a strike
from happening.

This is not like high school either. We are paying for this edu-
cation, and many of us work jobs and have other commitments in
addition to our class schedules. Many of us also find jobs before
we graduate and are expected to start working right after we
graduate. But if the faculty were to strike, every one of these
plans would be thrown off course. The university is not confined
to an 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. schedule like high school was. If a strike
happened, missed classes would have to be made up somehow,
most likely by making classes longer and later.

Though we acknowledge the faculty’s right to be recognized
and heard by the administration, we challenge them to answer
this question: what level of concern will be shown by the faculty
toward students’ needs and demands? Students have even less
voice than the faculty, and someone needs to keep our interests in
mind.

something
today. I

Sean H e

delivered that
..__._._______. life-altering
news while I was waiting to
cross Forbes Avenue by
Hillman Library. There he was,
standing at the corner, handing
out pamphlets. I took one, natu-
rally, and proceeded to read it.
All I needed to see was the
word “Jesus” highlighted, and I
quickly gave it back. Then I
asked him why he feels com-
pelled to push his religion on
everybody else?

His reply: “Because Jesus
died for you, and I don’t want
to see you die.” .

Wow! Jesus did that just for
little 01’ me? That was awfully
nice of him. After I digested
what he said, I replied, “No he
didn’t. He doesn’t even know
who I am.” Needless to say, that
ﬁred up the ageless reverend.

We proceeded to argue for‘ 10
minutes about his skewed
philosophies, but that’s beside
the point.

The point is this: why does
anyone feel the need to adver-
tise religion? If I’m not mistak-
en, religion is a personal belief,
not something that’s pushed on
street corners like a drug. But in
one respect, religion is like a
drug to many people. It brain-
washes the masses, stealing
their right to think for them-
selves. Instead, they rely on an
ancientbook to do the thinking
for them.

And recently these “religion
pushers” have been signiﬁcant-
ly more prevalent at Pitt. I don’t
know if this is the recruiting
season or what, but they’re out
in droves. ‘ j

A couple weeks ago, a dozen-

Duncan

' or-so Hare Krishnas were out in

front of The Pitt Stop singing
and dancing in a circular
motion. They were also trying
to lasso any bystander walking
their way to sell them their reli-
gion. I must admit though, they
have a lot to offer. The
Krishnas offered me unlimited
free haircuts, a ﬁrst-round draft
pick and the right to publicly
humiliate myself if I just con-
vert.

That’s a pretty lucrative offer.
But why? Why do they want to
convert everybody to their reli-
gion? If their religion is so
good, why don’t they feel
secure enough to have their
beliefs and that’s it? The
Krishnas would rebut that their
religion is so good they just
want to spread it to everybody.
It sounds like they’re as inse-
cure as a pimply-faced teen.

But it’s not just the Krishnas,
it’s everybody with religious
pamphlets, books and street
preachers. They’re selling
something that’s sacred like a
cheap advertisement.

Religion is not something
that can be debated. There’s no
better belief than another.
That’s the cool aspect of reli-
gion — it’s personal.

If these people claim to wor-
ship and live by their religion,
why must they cheapen it by
prostituting it on the streets? It’s
illogical. And moreover, it’s
outright irritating.

It’s even more irritating when
these people falsely advertise
their product. Just yesterday I
fell prey to a squat little lady
who was passing out dainty yel-
low pamphlets with a picture
the late Jerry Garcia holding a
guitar. It read above him, “Who
are the Grateful Dead?” I took
it with the understanding that I
was going to learn something
about Jerry Garcia.

I was sadly mistaken. Instead
I got another religious adver-
tisement; this time it was an ad
for a church. The pamphlet
started with the premise that
“Grateful Dead” is an oxy-

moron. That is to say, no person
actually wants to die because
death will put them in a face-to-
face confrontation with “a Holy
God who will judge their sin an
internal lake of fire!” It pro-
ceeded to say that “those that
die without God’s salvation will
wish that they had surrendered
their hearts to Christ.”

This work of art concluded
like this: “Truly the only
‘Grateful Dead’ will be those
who have repented of their sins
and will spend the next life in
heaven with their Lord. Won’t
you right now bow your head
and receive the Risen Saviour
the Lord Jesus Christ?”

That wasn’t about Jerry
Garcia, or was it?

I don’t want to single any-
body out (Faith Bible Baptist
Church), but do you think the
makers of this fine piece of lit-
erature truly believed that peo-
ple will actually conform or
suddenly find their religion by
reading this? I don’t think so.
The only people who took the
pamphlet were those who want-
ed to read something about
Jerry Garcia.

They’re hoping these cheap
advertising ploys will eventual-
ly begin to erode at the mass
population. It has worked with
every other kind of advertise-
ment, why wouldn’t it work
now?

These pushers are assuming
that the general population is a
mindless, naive group that can
easily be swayed to their
beliefs.

It is our job as a responsible-

(not mindless) group to say to
these pushers, “Hey. we don’t
want your stinkin’ religion."
and shove their beautifully pho-
tocopied pamphlet in their face.
Because after all, your reli-
gion is no one else’s but yours.
And no toothless street prophet.
no squat little lady or no Hare
Krishna can refute that fact.

The largest crowd in Pitt Midnight
Madness history turned out this past
Saturday night/Sunday morning to watch
the first legal practice of the Panther men’s
and women’s basketball teams.
Celebrities, contests and prizes were the
theme of the program, which only featured
brief appearances by the squads.

The first event of the night was the
men’s slam dunk/women’s shootout com-
petition, which gave all those interested a
chance to show the Field House crowd just
why they are not on the college basketball
teams. The men’s final featured one partic-
ipant who notched no dunks the entire
night, while the victor in the women’s
competition made one shot in the 30 sec-
onds of the final round to notch the victo-

The celebrity foul shot competition was
next on the agenda, featuring the likes of
chancellor Mark Nordenberg, fan favorite
Panther Paul and Pittsburgh Steeler defen-
sive lineman Kevin Henry. Both Henry
and the chancellor won their matches
against an audience participant. Panther
Paul was narrowly defeated by a Pitt stu-
dent hailing from West Virginia, which
nearly caused a fan riot.

The scoreboard clock began its 30-
minute descent to midnight just as the Izzy
Dizzy contest began. This event, requiring
contestants to spin around a bat a dozen
times before attempting to shoot a basket-
ball, resulted in the expected slapstick. It
also provided the night with its first and
only injury, a constant in most of Pitt’s fall
sporting events, when a competitor stum-
bled out of the gate and fell face-ﬁrst onto
the hardwood ﬂoor.

At about 20 before midnight, Kevin
Henry -of the Steelers was called out again

to shoot against members of the
Lady Panther basketball team. As
expected, he lost in his two con-
tests, keeping it close in the sec-
ond with junior LaTonya Durham
before falling 15-10.

Henry also participated in the
“shooting for money” portion of
the program, where he and four
audience members attempted to
earn anywhere from $25 to $200
by sinking a range of shots. All
opted for chances at big money
from beyond the three—point arc,
and all cracked under the pres-
sure of thousands of screaming
fans and local television cover-
age. Henry’s shot, a three—pointer
that would have added $200 to
his NFL check, bounced off the "
front of the rim to the jeers of the 2
crowd. 5

Finally, the lights went down, 
and the players of both teams 
were introduced under the field 5
house spotlights. Women’s head 
coach Kirk Bruce told the packe '
house that there was “no reason ,
why you can’t come out like you 
are in full force tonight to support
our women.’’ '

Men’s coach Ralph Willard 
was introduced next, and he told ‘
the crowd, “We need to make

place in America to play college

X-country scorc

The Pitt men’s and women’s cross country teams
had some fun last Saturday at the Red Flash
Invitational at Saint Francis College, which was
Pitt’s last tune up before the Big East Conference
championships. Fun as it was, all was not play for
the Panthers. .

“It was a fun meet, but they raced,” coach Dave
Sobal said. “They ran fairly hard, and some of
them ran very well.” ~

There were few» outstanding individual perfor-
mances, but everyone ran a solid race.

“The women were true to form all the way down
the line,” Sobal said. “IfI were to single anyone
out, it would be Melanie Ishman. She loves the

' course. It was tough, but she got out and was pre-

pared. to run well, and she did.”

Ishman came in second in therace in 21:41, 41
seconds behind teammate Stacy Anderson. Pitt
placed seven runners in the top 10 in-the race,
including the top four (Anderson, Ishman, Amy
Francy and Stephanie Ellsworth). Pitt’s 16 points
won the meet by a wide margin. Second place St.
Francis had 53 points.

The men won their race in similar fashion — 15

ipoints_(the lowest possible team score) to St.

Bonaventure’s 55.

“The instructions for the top seven men were to
go out hard and run together. For our other two, just
to run as good as possible and beat the other
teams,” Sobal said.

The turning point came at about the three-mile

0. mark when Pitt’s Frank'Nesko and Dennis Kuntz,

who had been leading the race, got to the top of a

and looked back down to__ see nothing but Pitt ‘

jerseys following them. They slowed down to
regroup with their teammates and finished the race
together. A

You can’t run any closer together than Pitt’s top
four ﬁnishers. Kuntz, Nesko, Julio Ortiz and Ed
Adamson all ﬁnished with the same ofﬁcial time
— 28:29. Pitt runners also finished in places 5-8
and 12 overall.

The course presented as much of a challenge to
the Panthers as the other teams did.

‘The last kilometer was uphill, so it was a tough
ﬁnish,” Sobal said.

Last week, some of Pitt’s runners raced against
the same teams at Schenley Park. The times were
slower at St. Francis for everyone, about 1:25 slow-
er on average, according to Sobal.

Pitt gets a‘ break from racing for homecoming
weekend, then races in the Big East championships
at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx the following
weekend.

The conference provides Pitt with some of the
stiffest competition in the nation. On the women’s
side, Villanova is currently the top-ranked team in
the country, and Providence and Georgetown are
also in the top ﬁve. Notre Dame, a new addition to
the Big East this year, and Boston College are also
near the top 25.

“There are at least ﬁve strong programs in the
Big East,” Sobal said. “If the women can hold their
sixth—place finish from last year, they’ll be doing
well.”

A similar situation faces the men’s squad.
Georgetown, Notre Dame and Providence are all
ranked among the top 18 teams in the land, and
Villanova is not far behind. .

“We’re not a nationally ranked program; we’re

the next level down. We just want to stay as close

Lacrosse team splits
Cil WVU tournament

By Matt Townsend
Staff Writer

_ played

Last weekend the men’s
lacrosse team played in a
double-elimination tourna-
ment at WVU and went 2-2,
bowing out in the fourth
round to the eventual win-
ner —— The Carrol County
Lacrosse Club.

In the first game on
Saturday, Pitt came from
behind to beat Frostburg
State 7-5. In the second half
Pitt’s defense halted the
opposition, and allowed the
team to overcome a 4-2
deficit. Rob Heaps and Pat
Shea scored two goals each,
and Mike Tanniru scored,
another.

“We started off slow and
were down 4-2 at the half,
and we came out in the sec-
ond half and shut them
down,” said head coach
Gary Neff. “Our defense
extremely well
despite missing some peo-
ple.”

Down 3-2 at halftime
against Illinois, Pitt again
came back to make "it 3-3.
Illinois pushed the lead to
6-3 before Pitt mounted
another comeback to make
it 6-5, but it could get no
closer as the Illini scored in
the final seconds to make
the final 7-5. Goals were
scored by Heaps, Tanniru,
Shea and Mark Policretti.

“We played them closer
than anyone down there,”

- Neff said. “It was a 6-5

game until the closing sec-
onds, and we had some
good opportunities to score
that weren’t taken advan-

tage of.”

On a rainy, muddy
Sunday, Pitt took on the
Morgantown lacrosse club
and won 5-2. The team
again started off slow, as it
did all tournament, and was
tied at the half, 1-1. In the
second half Morgantown
went up 2-1 before Pitt
scored four unanswered
goals.

“The conditions were real-
ly bad after the rain from
the night before,” Neff said.
“We played much better in
the second half. I was
pleased with this win
because Morgantown is
made out of college players
who have a lot more experi-
ence, and we beat them.”

In their fourth game Pitt
took on The Carrol County
Lacrosse Club. Pitt fell
behind 3-2 at half and then
tied the game‘3-3 early in
the second. Carrol County

then took the lead for good’

and ended up winning a
close one, 7-6.

“We should have won this
game. We controlled the
whole game, we just
couldn’t put the ball in the
net. We had about 10 shots
on goal that didn’t go in,”
Neff said. “Our defense
played well and kept us in
this one. We are very young,
and it’s going to take time

- to get the offense to where I

want it. Overall, everyone
played well, and I was
pleased with the waywe
played at the tournament.”

This Saturday at 7 p.m.,
Pitt will take on state rival
Penn State at the Cost
Center.

Joe:  Green you’re a helluva reporter. Outstanding
question. Here’s the rest of my plan. Mr. White, paying
attention?”
« Mr. White: “Whoa! Ooh, yeah.”

Joe: “Good, I hate wrestling. I have torn down all your
practice facilities. No more practice for those little pansies
that consistently have All-Americans.”

Mr. White: “I’m about to get medieval on your ass.”
[Mr. White gets up and charges Joe. Nice Guy Eddie is
waiting with his sub-atomic bazooka gun with rapid—ﬁre
action. Mr. White is dead.]

Nice Guy Eddie: “Got him there, hey daddy?”

Joe: “It certainly makes things much easier Good work”
Mr. Green: “What about Mr. Pink and Mr. Blonde?”
Joe: “Once again, outstanding question. Alright, Mr. Pink,
as you well know, when I hired you; you were in on the
master plan. I hired you not to recruit any good players,
and to make sure that good players found a way to get

as possible,” Sobal said. “The
men would also be doing well to
maintain sixth place from last
year.”

The Big East championships
will have as many runners as
any race Pitt has been in this
year — far more than the Saint
Francis meet.

“It’s a different race, and dif-
ferent people react differently,”
Sobal said. “That’s where expe-
rience pays.”

Excitement is already building
among the Panthers.

“Everybody’s interested in
getting results from the other
schools. They’re excited,” Sobal
said. “That’s a sign of a good
team —- they’re excited and
looking ahead to the chance to
see what they can do.”

Mr. Pink: ‘Thanks big guy.”
Joe: “Now, that Temple loss was
a work of art In no time at all,
this program will be run under
the ground. Over a 100 years of
Pitt football shall soon be history,
and you can go back and retire.”
Mr. Pink: “That’s music to my
[Mr. Pink exits and boards a
plane to Florida]

Joe: “Good, now Mr. Blonde,
our situation is much more com-
plicated. I am gravely disappoint-
ed that you went out and brought
in such great recruits. You really
got this campus excited. What
the hell are ya thinking?”

Mr. Blonde: “I just want to
win.”

Joe: “No. We can’t have this.
Find a way to make all your
players ineligible this season.”
Mr. Blonde: “I will win. But,
ﬁrst, I ’m gonna shoot you in the
face.”

[Mr. Blonde points a gun at

J 0e.]

Nice Guy Eddie: “I swear,
Blonde. If you do that, I’ll shoot A
you in the face.”

[Nice Guy Eddie points a gun at
Mr. Blonde.]

Joe: “Now, can’t we all just get
along? This is not necessary.”

Tensions mount, and eventual?

ly shots are ﬁred. Everybody falls
to the ground, dead. Mr. Green
just smiles, because now he
knows that the future of Pitt ath-
letics is in his hands.

Pharmaceutical Research Services
Current Available Study Opportunities

Novum, Inc. is a research services company that conducts trials of both marketed and unmarketed medications for the pharmaceutical

‘ industry. The types of studies undertaken at Novum include both new experimental medications and generic versions of already-
marketed name-brand medications. Most studies require overnights stays in our facility in Pittsburgh. Also, taking an unmarketed
medication and having blood samples drawn is typical for most studies. A free physical examination, medical history, and laboratory
tests, including blood work, conﬁrm your eligibility for our studies.

   

Below is a summary of studies currently available at Novum. If you are a healthy male or female at least 18 years of age and interested
in further information about participation in clinical trials at Novum, please contact us at (412) 363-0400 or 1-800-756-5227.
All calls are conﬁdential and there is no obligation if you call.
