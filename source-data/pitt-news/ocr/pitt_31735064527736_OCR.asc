~ to capitol

Dr. H. Andrew Wissinger has seen
enough of Pitt Panther football. He has
withdrawn indefinitely his $2,500 annual
contribution to the Golden Panthers and
has given up his eight season tickets in
section 19, right on the 50-yard line.

Wissinger has been a Pitt Panther football
fan since his grade-school days and a
member of the Golden Panthers since the
organization’s inception in December 1970.
He has missed only about two dozen
hoﬁhe games since the late 1930s.

“I’ve seen the Pitt football program
deteriorate over the past five years, and
I’m not sure that the administration that’s
in charge of this team is paying enough

“I’ve lost interest  For many years I’ve
watched the Pitt football team through all
the bad years and the good years. This
year it dawned on me after about two or
three games that I’m not having fun
anymore, and [the reason] is not [because
Pitt’s] losing,” he added.

During his 60-plus years as a Pitt fan,
Wissinger has been a part of numerous
college-football eras, and he has been a
knowledgeable eyewitness to the peaks
and valleys Pitt football has experienced.
He has seen the John B. “Jock” Sutherland
era, when Pitt compiled a brilliant 111-20-
12 record, went undefeated four times,
was invited to the Rose Bowl four times
and was recognized five times as national

nine seasons after Sutherland, which saw
four coaching changes and an abysmal 28-
50-2 record.

After Sutherland and up until 1954, no
less than eight men were called to the
head coaching position, as the Panthers
dwelled in mediocrity. Wissinger has also
been a part of the legendaryjohn Michelson
era and the success of Johnny Majors and
Jackie Sherrill.

He’s seen some great teams and some
absolutely horrible ones step onto the
gridiron for over half a century. And after
all those years of witnessing the best and
worst Pitt football teams, why bail out
now?

“I am a consumer. I know when I’m

money away [to Pittl, I don’t expect to be
repaid dollar for dollar in any way. All I
want is to see positive things happen, and
if bad things happen, I expect somebody
to have reflected on what happened and
make sure it doesn’t happen again. I don’t
see that,” Wissinger said.

One of the main reasons for his
disappointment with the football program
is Pitt's hiring and ﬁring of coaches. Out
with Foge Fazio, in with Mike Gottfried
and his lifetime contract (which had to be
bought out) —— out with Gottfried and in
with Paul Hackett. With such changes at
the helm, players being immersed in a
single system of coaching is highly unlikely.

WASHINGTON, D.C.-—As part
of the 18—year battle to overturn
the Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court
decision, 19 Pitt students
traveled to Washington, D.C.,
to participate in the national
March For Life.

‘ Armed with “Adoption not
Abortion” and “The Natural
Choice is Life” posters, over
50,000 pro—lifers demonstrated
yesterday, protesting the 1973
decision that legalized abortion.

“Take a bold stand for life,”
Rep. Christopher Smith (R.—N.J.)
told a cheering crowd. “We need
to stir the slumber of the
apathetic.”

Stqﬂ‘ Writer

WASHINGTON, D.C. -— Pitt Students
For Life Presidentjoel Garrett was among
the pro—life demonstrators voicing their
opinions during an open forum with
Sen. Arlen Specter following yesterday’s
March For Life.

Garrett informed Specter (R.-Pa.) that
the Pitt College Republicans and Students
For Life supported Rep. Rick Santorum’s
successful November congressional
campaign.

“We need a candidate that will stand
for life all the way and never back
down,” Garrett told Specter before a
cheering crowd, “but so far your record
does not appeal to us.”

Paul Diamond/The Pitt News
The March For Life in protest to Roe Vs. Wade stopped at the Supreme Court yesterday, where protestors held signs and chanted.

“I am as committed to human life as
you are,” Specter announced amidst
booing from the audience. “My personal
position is that I am opposed to abortion,
but I do not believe the government
should regulate it.”

When a pregnant woman asked the
senator if he believed her unborn child
was a human with rights, Specter said,
“If I believe life begins with conception
is a question I’m asked every year, and
here’s the answer I’ve given repeatedly:
I do not believe that you can answer that
question as a question of fact, but that’s
a question that has to be determined by
the courts.”

Pro-life advocates left the forum
murmuring that Specter will not be re-
elected.

THE PIT!’ NEWS, Wednesday, January 23. 1991

Faculty urged to promote War discussion

By Renee Crespy

and Eric Hoch
Sta_ﬂ" Writers

The Pittsburgh Students for
Peace and Faculty for Peace sent
a letter yesterday to Pitt faculty
members, asking them to let
students lead class discussions
about the war.

The letter called for Jan. 23 to
be a “day of discussion and
reflection on these sobering

events and their effects on our
lives. ” The letter urged professors
to use their class time to encourage
students to engage in an open
discussion of their concerns.
Jill Castek, a member of
Students for Peace, formerly
Students Against the War, said
she wants students to participate
in class discussions of the war.
“We want students to initiate
the dialogue on the situation in
the Persian Gulf with the support

and help of their professors,"
said Castek. “As a goal, we hope
that at least in one of every
student’s classes, there will be a
discussion, whether it be for 20
minutes or the entire class.

“I think that the faculty should
acknowledge that [the war] is
really important, and life doesn’t
go on as usual. [I hope that this]
will get people to talk about
what they feel and get rid of
some of the apathy.”

Some teachers plan to
encourage discussion about the
war, and several have already
held such discussions.

Carlo Rovelli, a faculty member
in the physics department,
believes class discussion on the
war will help students.

“One of the main things the
university should provide is an
opportunity for students to discuss
and think about it [the war],” said

Israel suffered another missile

_attack from Iraq yesterday;

however, this one was fatal.

Five people died, and 70 were
wounded when one Scud missile
hit a residential district in Tel
Aviv.

The U.S. government recently
sent a group of Patriot missiles
and crews to man them to Israel
in an attempt to defend that
country from these Scud attacks.
Israel said that two Patriots were
ﬁred at the incoming missile, but
it Slippeél through. The Bush
administration said Monday that
the missiles were “operational.”

This attack could escalate the
possibility of retaliation by the
Israelis, something that the United
States has been trying to avoid.

These missiles are the same
models that are currently being
used to defend Saudi Arabia from
these attacks.

0 Saudi Arabia also came under
attack three times. However, all
incoming Scud missiles were
destroyed by Patriots. No injuries
caused by Scud attacks have yet
been reported in Saudi Arabia.

pre—war threat. Sources in Saudi
Arabia reported that Iraq has
destroyed a major oil well in
southern Kuwait along with major
storage tanks. There are reports
that oil wells in northern Kuwait
are also on ﬁre.

Saddam Hussein had
threatened before the war to
destroy oil wells in Kuwait if
allied forces attacked. There were
rumors that the oil wells had
been mined in preparation for an
allied attack.

-Reports out of Iraq said that
many holy sites within Iraq have
been damaged by allied bombs.
Radio Baghdad reported that both
Muslim shrines and Christian
churches have either been
destroyed or damaged in the air
raids. Iraq has vowed to retaliate
by sending out “guerrilla suicide
missions” around the world.

-The British military reported
that another plane had been shot
down over Iraq. This brings the
overall number of planes lost to

17. The Americans have so far
lost eight planes. The Pentagon
said yesterday that no American

the past 24 hours. The Iraqis are
reporting that 177 have been
shot down.

olraq broadcast two more
prisoners of war over Cable News
Network yesterday. This brings
the number of POWS shown to
seven. Iraq claims to have as
many as 20 in captivity. The
world has expressed its outrage
at the ﬂaunting of these men.
President Bush has said that their
mistreatment is a direct violation
of the Geneva Convention rules,
which state that no POWS will be
mistreated or put on public
display.

-There are reports that Saudi
troops pulled back when the first

and British forces said that Saudi
troops were in such a hurry to
leave the front lines that they left

Soldier says troops
under strict dicipline

By Debbie Lincoln
Staﬁ’ Writer

Ken Anderson, a member of the Navy Mobil_e Construction
Battalion, returned home last month after a 10-week stay in the
desert of Saudi Arabia.

A native of New Castle, Pa., the 21-year-old soldier spent the
latter third of his eight—month deployment preparing camps and
battle stations for American combat troops near jubaio, Saudi
Arabia.

Anderson said the morale of U.S. troops, some of which have
been stationed in the region for five months, is variable, with
many soldiers doubting their purpose there.

“In the beginning it was pretty bad; nobody really wanted to
be there. A lot of guys thought we were just there for oil,” he
said.

According to Anderson, officers have demanded unusually
strict discipline of the soldiers’ public appearances while
stationedin a Muslim country.

“They kept drilling it into us, the things you couldn't do to
offend the Arabs. You couldn’t show them the bottom of your
feet because it’s considered to be demeaning. A thumbs-up sign
is considered a curse,” said Anderson.

Despite these warnings, Anderson rarely came into contact
with any Saudi civilians or military personnel because he was

“I don’t actually know who
hires and fires coaches, and I
don’t really care to know. All I
know is that whoever it is, even
if it’s the Wizard of Oz, they’re
not doing very well,” Wissinger

 

‘ said. “If you have to fire people

for not being capable over and
over again, the hirer and the firer
ought to look at himself and say,
‘What am I doing? Am I making
the same mistakes over again, or
am I just no good at this? And for
the good of everybody, including
me, should I quit?’

“Coaches also leave because
they are capable, but they’re not
provided with an environment
they believe they can do their
best job in. I think [Pitt has] had
some of that also. Obviously, the
same people or person who’s
hiring and firing the coaches is
responsible [for providing the
environment]. If we have to fire
inept coaches or lose good
coaches over and over again,
there’s something wrong with
the way [Pitt] is doing things,” he
added.

When he came to that
realization, Wissinger decided that
Pitt football would have to go
along without him indefinitely.
He may get involved with the
program again at an unspecified

point in the future, but not until
he sees some improvement on
the field and a more positive
direction in administrative
decisions off the field.

“And it doesn’t matter if it’s the
athletic director or two athletic
directors or an athletic committee.
Whoever is hiring [coaches], if
they’re not capable, sooner or
later they have to come to grips
with the idea that,‘I’m not good
at this,’" he said.

Another thing Pitt isn’t too good
at, according to Wissinger, is the
way the Panthers play football.

“In the last few years, Pitt plays
football like I play golf. They
have one good play, a mediocre
play and then a penalty. 1 have
no complaint with the players,
nor the coaches,” he said.

“I’m not an [alumnus] who
expects Pitt football to go out
and be in the running for the
national championship every year
 But I’d like to go out and see
Pitt and their opponents play the
game the way it should be
played.”

Wissinger’s definition of good
football is a wel1—executed game
plan with an emphasis on
minimizing penalties, something
the Panthers did infrequently
during the 1990 season.

Pitt averaged almost seven

“For a while, I thought it was
the officials, lbutl you can’t get
bad officiating week in and week
out. They’re a different bunch of
men! The kids are confused. Every
time they turn around, they have
a new coach and a new system,
and by the time they learn it,
there’s another new coach and a
new system,” Wissinger said.

“I don’t want to spend my
Saturdays watching rebuilding for
the next 20 years. I’ll wait until it’s
built and come back."

In fact, the Pitt alumnus would
not have a problem if the Panthers
decided to drop out of Division I
football and play in some other
league, as long as Pitt would be
playing teams of its caliber.
Football glory and the national
championship are secondary
thoughts to Wissinger, but a well-
run football team is first on his

priority list.

“If we're going to schedule
Notre Dame, Miami and Okla-
homa, I don’t expect to beat 311
three of them, but I expect to be
competitive. And if we can’t be
competitive, then I see no reason
to play them,” he said.

Indeed, the Panthers lost to
those three teams by a combined
score of 128-32 this past season.
Included in that score is the 52-10
thrashing by the Sooners and the
45-0 shutout in the Orange Bowl
at the hands of the Hurricanes.

But Wissinger has no problem
with first-year head coach Paul
Hackett, stressing that Hackett
has not had the opportunity to
develop his own system yet,
something Hackett himself has
been known to say.

Concerning the alleged missing
Golden Panther funds, Wissinger
simply considers it a case of poor
management. The case has been
turned over to the Allegheny
County district attorney’s office

and is under review.

“[The Golden Panthers and the
missing money] is just poor
management. Whether it’s losing
a coach every two years for some
reason or not keeping track of
money, it’s all the same to me. It’s
just irrational to think they
wouldn’t have a system of
financial accountability that
would make stealing impossible,
Any time you have a situation
where one person has access to
the money and doesn’t have to
answer for it, there’s the potential
for theft.

“What goes through my mind
is: Is the financial organization in
place? Is there a conspiracy? Is

there more than one person that 5

walked off with the money? Is the
money really gone?

“I don’t have all that much faith
in what’s going on up there.
Maybe there isn’t any money
missing; maybe there’s three times

as much money missing.

largely restricted to his base. He
said, “I didn’t like living there
because we had no liberty. We
couldn’t even ﬂy the American
flag or leave camp. You’re like a
prisoner there; that wasthe main
morale problem.”

To adjust to the desert
temperatures, Anderson’s
battalion began to work around
5:30 a.m. and took a three-hour
lunch break to avoid the midday
sun. Despite the constant supply
of drinking water available to
stave off dehydration, Anderson
said many soldiers were affected
by the heat and took longer than
others to adapt to the 105-degree
temperatures.

According to Anderson, there
are some soldiers in Saudi Arabia
who were anxious for the war to
get under way. He said, “The
Marines want to go to war because
many of them have been over
there since August, and they were
told they weren’t leaving until
the job was over and peace was
settled.”

For the time being, Anderson
will be stationed on a naval base
in Oxmard, Calif. “I was supposed
to get out in seven months, but
with the situation in the [Persian]
Gulf, I’ll probably stay in an extra
year,” he said.

Senator Arlen Specter (R - Pa.) asserted to a Pro-life group yesterday
that he is against abortion, but that the government shouldn't be
involved in the decision making process.

taking of a human life and morally
wrong,” added Rep. Barbara
Macanovich of Nevada. “Plain
and simple, abortion is murder.”

Sen. Jesse Helms (R.-NC.) was
greeted by cheers. “If the price of
staying in the U.S. Senate was
turning my back on innocent,
helpless, unborn children,” he
said, “then the price was just too
high.” Helms told the pro—life
marchers he wouldn't com-
promise on the right-to-life issue.

Led by Nellie Gray, president
of March for Life, demonstrators
included members of Athletes for
Life, Focus on the Family,
Operation Rescue and American
Collegians for Life. On the
international level, a repre-
sentative from the pro—life
movement in Japan made a brief

V. speech.

Reagan wrote, “you are speaking
for those who are unable. You
are their voice.”

“Pro-choice is a lie. Babies never
choose to die,” chanted the
demonstrators as they marched
up Constitution Avenue to the
Supreme Court.

The marchers then met with
several members of Congress in
the House of Representatives and
Senate office buildings.

“We're all here today to speak
up for the pre—born children in
America,” said Joel Garrett,
president of Pitt Students For
Life. “1.6 million [unborn babiesl

N inety—eight percent of those are
due to convenience. We think
that we need to protect human

Rick Strom, the Pittsburgh

fiancee, Karen. “This is the first
time we’re making the trip to

to be here.”

Rovelli. “It should promote
conscious critical thinking from
the students and help them come
up with some judgments of their
own."

Carol Mc;Allister of the women’s
studies department and Thomas
Kane of the communications
department have already had
discussions in their classes about
the war.McAllister said that she

had assigned an article on Islamic
women for last Tuesday night's
class, and during that class the
students expressed an interest in
discussing the war and relating it
to the class.

“If there is strong sentiment to
discuss the war again, I will do it.
As of last week, I think it gave
people a chance to discuss and
relate it to the study ofwomen. It
got students to think through

their ideas,” she said.

After the war broke out last
Wednesday night, Kane’s students
approached him the next day in
class. They were supposed to
discuss a speech from 1877, but
they discussed President Bush’s
speech about the war instead.

“I thought the discussion was
healthy and was conducted in a
civil manner," Kane said. “For
this generation, which has never

experienced a war, I believe we
have a need to discuss and Shaffi
feelings.”

Castek said she hopes that
discussions will help both
students who support and
students who oppose the war to
express their views.

“We want this to be an open
form of discussion. It’s not to
sway {people} either way,” said
Castek.

PIT‘?

 OF PITTSBURGH

Conflicting feelings on the war in the Gulf THE prrr m

It was about 7 p.m. on Jan. 16,
and I was sitting around The Pitt
News office trying to think of an
article idea. I was toying with the
idea of a column about how the
anti-war protesters had been dis-
turbing my classes in the Cathedral
of Learning on Monday and Tues-
day. And then I heard the news.
The United States had bombed
Baghdad, and the war against Iraq
had begun.

I felt about 100 differentemotions
at once, but none of them was
particularly stronger than any of
the others. I had just said goodbye
to one of my best friends on
Tuesday night as he prepared to
ship off to the Army for basic‘
training as part of a four-year term
in the infantry. He would not see
active duty in Saudi Arabia, but the
thought of joining the Army on the
day of the start of the war was
something that we had laughed
and commented about. Little did
we know what a reality it would
be.

As the news about the war came

David W.
Matta

into the newspaper office, the staff
sprang into action. Several report-
ers and photographers were dis-
patched to do stories about the
campus and city reaction to the
events. I called my closest friends,

and they were all gathered around
television sets watching every news

broadcast from ABC to Cable News

Network. But no one said anything.

There were no positive or negative

remarks or comments about the

actions of the United States.

The most common response was,

“Wow, it is really happening.” And

this, too, was my personal reaction.

I felt sort of sick to my stomach

despite the fact that I.wholeheart-

edly support the policy of President

Bush and the nation toward Saddam

Hussein and Iraq. Thus I was also

glad that the United States had

finally done something about the
military takeover of Kuwait.

I felt the sudden need to talk to
people whom I cared about and
loved. I called my family and my
friends, and I still did not feel
satisfied. I had nothing to say to
any of them. I was searching for
something —— maybe answers to
questions and feelings that did not
exist. I guess I felt sort of alone in
the world, alone in a country where
the population had stood in dis-
agreement about the threat of war
for the past four months. Alone in
a country where just last Tuesday I
found myself sitting in a classroom
where, with the windows closed, I
could not even hear a classmate
across the room speaking because
of the chants that reverberated
throughout Oakland against the
war and the president. It was these
protests and protesters that had
annoyed me so much that I came
up to the office to write about it.
But then these things seemed pretty
insignificant in the shadow of the
first true war in my lifetime, which

began inthe last days of the Viet-
nam War.

Then came the questions that
rushed through my head in a ﬂurry.
Will there be classes tomorrow?
Will the draft be reinstated? Will I
be called to serve? Will I go ifI am
called? What will the university be
like for the next couple of months?
What will happen next?

No one likes a war. But some-
times a war is necessary to preserve
the principles on which things like
freedom are based. The world is
not a perfect place. No matter how
this war makes me or anyone else
feel, it is necessary for the common
and better good of the people of
the world. It could have been
avoided by one man, and his name
is Saddam Hussein. Now all we can
do is hope and pray for as quick an
end to the war as possible, with as
few deaths on both sides as is
possible under the circumstances.
This is what I hope and pray for.

Casey administration looking in Wrong place

Will tuition increase again? Prob-
ably, though it’s actually not a
surprise. When I came to Pitt from
out of state, I estimated that my
$10,000 tuition would increase at
least 10 percent each year.

. But now tuition could rise even A

faster, thanks to Gov. Robert Casey’s
raping of college funds, a violation
thatwill cost Pitt $5.5 million. Many

students will be forced to dig even '

deeper into their already depleted
bank accounts; yet, we can’tblame
Pitt.

Pitt, however, is not entirely
without blame. The university
spends millions of dollars each
year on services which can be
eliminated. For example, in Octo-
ber, Jack Freeman, executive vice
president under Wesley Posvar,

Lisa
Raff

left Pitt for Temple University. But
after Freeman left, Posvar decided
it would "be better to eliminate
Freeman's position altogether and
distribute his responsibilities among
other employees. If his job could
have been eliminated, why was he
kept around for 23 years, and why
was he paid as much as $100,000 a
year?

Pitt will spend more than a quarter
of a million dollars on out-of-state
recruitment, and that’s not includ-
ing the salaries of the staff members

who work in that department. Is
this money really necessary? Be-
sides, if tuition escalates, many
out-of-staters won't be able to af-
ford it anyway — kind of a double-
edged sword. .

_vNow, shouldn’t Pitt have_seen
this money problem coming a long
time ago? I wonder how many
other jobs around the offices Pitt
could downgrade without having
to raise tuition as high as expected?

For years, Newsweek and Time
have been doing stories on the
decline of education in this coun-
try, and how far behind in tech-
nology the United States is com-
pared to other countries. Why then
does higher education cost so
much? Doesn’t the government
realize that cost is a major factor for

..--u

.:F-‘.

—~ -~Iu4L'

 p.muc.5 Jufit

almost all prospective college stu-
dents? The higher tuition is raised,
the lower the enrollment in higher
institutions of learning. Then what?
Will the United States really benefit
or will it catch up to the countries
that are so far ahead of us?

OK, so Pennsylvania’s deficit is
enormous, and Casey» needs to get
money from somewhere. But why
from ‘colleges and universities
across the state? Some ideas may
look great on paper," but the dev-
astating effects these propositions
cause are never really examined by
those who initiate them. If Casey
truly cared about Pennsylvania, he’d
give back some of his salary to save
the “little” people. But he doesn’t.

Barbara Hafer, who lost the
election against Casey last year, is

paid $84,000 a year for her position
as auditor general. Last week Hafer
declined a $10,000 raise — a de-
cision that has paved the way for
many other officials. The managers
in Hafer’s office who make more
than $40,000 a year have decided
to give up a 1 1/2-percent pay raise
indeﬁnitely to help the state. Casey,
on the other hand, just accepted a
$20,000-per-year raise.

Hafer predicted this deficit, and
I’m sure she had conceived many
ways for corners to be cut across
the state without having to sacrifice
as much as Casey is. “Casey this

week ordered the firing of 2,000 -

workers, the closing of four state
hospitals and hundreds of millions
of dollars in cuts to dozens of
programs to cope with a budget
deficit that he conceded could
approach $1 billion by June 30
(The Pittsburgh Press, Jan. 10,
1991).” What else could this man
do to hurt the state? Not much,
judging from what he's already
done. Casey's re-election was a
mistake, and I hope he realizes that
now, too.

public stand for a peaceful reso-

similar President Posvar’s statement
was to yours. It somehow seems
ironic to me that the administration
of this university and its student
representatives agree so closely on

an issue that may conceivably af- ,

this campus, the similarity being:
no comment, for all intents and

President Posvar’s statement was
not so shocking, after all, when

dealing with a bureaucracy in which

one virtually has no voice, and
where human beings are not con-

~ sidered much more than nine-digit

expected. However, for the student
representatives of this university to

an outrage. I would like to remind

Herbert Hoover returns
A The editorial of Dec. 6, 1990, by
Tom Lester, “... But radicals not the
answer,” represents a mentality that
borders on Herbert Hooverism.
Calling social-justice workers like
Vince Eirene a “professional activ-
ist” is a cheap shot. As anyone
involved in activism very well
knows, social-justice activism does
not buy one a house in the suburbs
or a new car. Most social-justice
activists have a hard time even
paying the rent. Vince Eirene pays
his bills by laboring with his hands

in a painting company and a moving ’

Letters

company. This work has not earned
him the “king’s ransom,” but he is
more concerned about morals than
money, much like many in jour-
nalism!

People like Vince Eirene protest

that permanent-security troops in

PSAW missing the point

[...] I, as a libertarian, am stead-
fastly opposed to U.S. involvement
in the Middle East. Not only are
libertarians united in their opposi-
tion to U.S. intervention, however,
but also a growing number of _
conservatives, relatives of soldiers
and other “Middle America" types
are increasingly questioning the
desirability of sacriﬁcing American
lives an resources for the emir of
Kuwait or so-called “allies” abroad.

Wrestlers full to Cleveland State,

, By Bob Maselli
Sta_ﬂ"Writer

The Panther wrestling squad

’ dropped to 2-4 overall after a

tough 24-19 loss to Cleveland
State last night at Fitzgerald Field
House, and things aren’t looking

any better.

The Panthers are hampered by

_ the losses of Sean Gibbs and

Chad Pines. Both men are out
with knee injuries for at least two
more weeks. With the injuries,

 the team is looking at a lineup full

of freshmen, inexperienced

$ sophomores and a lot of moving
 around.

“We’ve been hurting a lot this

2 season with injuries. Two of them
» are starters,” said Panther Coach

v

Rande Stottlemyer. “But the 10
guys you put out there are your
team, and you’ve got to go from
there.”

The match wasn’t completely a
loss, though, with Pitt recording
four wins.

Steve Budman (142 pounds),
Scott Hovan (158), Jeff Kloiber
(190) and Perry Miller
(heavyweight) all came out with
victories. Hovan and Miller each
recorded pins. Hovan’s pin came

 with 35 seconds left in the first

period, and Miller’s pin came

 with one second left in the match.

Hovan’s pin marks his 10th in 17

matches.

“These guys are pouring their
hearts out when they wrestle,"
said Stottlemyer. “They’re as
hungry as can be. You can’t ask
for anything more from them.
Scotty [Hovan] had the eye of the
tiger within him tonight. He’s one
of the best in the nation.”

Stottlemyer was pleased with
his wrestlers, especially Budman,
who has improved in the past
week after a slow start in the
beginning of the season. But in
the same respect, Stottlemyer is
still disappointed in the wrestlers
in the lower weight classes, where
there has been trouble all season.

“Stevie’s been coming on as of
late, and he’s been our go—to
man, but he’s only one win out of
our first four men. We need help
in the other weights."

Both Budman and Kloiber
wrestled well, upping their overall
records to 7-7 and 8-5,
respectively. Both men took
control of their matches from the
start and never let their opponents
gain momentum. Budman earned
a major decision 13-3, and Kloiber
won his decision 8-5.

“We’re just one brick short of a
full load,” said Stottlemyer,
reflecting on the season thus far.
“We lose by only a few points
when we lose, and it’s tough.”

Sta_[f Writer

Men’s gymnastics coach Frank
D’Amico was a little worried going
into Sunday’s meet against
William and Mary. He knew he
had a good team, but he wasn't
quite sure it could put it all
together for its season opener.

“I would like to know that we
can go in there and win by 10
points, but I can’t say that,” he
said, expecting a showdown. “It
would be nice if I didn’t have to
worry.”

But as it turned out, he didn’t
have to worry at all.

Pitt outscored both William and
Mary and Radford in every event
and came up a big winner by
almost 15 points. When it was all
over, the damage was done: Pitt
scored 268.15 — its best mark in
eight years — to William and
Mary’s 253.3, and Radford’s 232.7.

“It’s a great feeling to score this
high this soon,” D’Amico said,
“and not to just score.that high,
but to break almost every record
in the last seven or eight years.”

But he insisted. he was still
concerned.

“I was very careful throughout
the whole meet," he said. “I kept
accurate account ofwhatWilliam
and Mary was doing all the time.”

One ofD’Amico’s chiefworries
was the floor exercise, William
and Mary’s best event. Injuries
plagued Pitt’s top competitors in
the event, and he was afraid they
couldn’t match up, score for score.
But William and Mary had injuries

a tri~meet against F&M, Rutgers
and Brown. Following that match,
the Panthers will travel to
Bloomsburg on Saturday, Feb. 2.

The next home match for Pitt
will be against Kent State on
Tuesday, Feb. 5.

Gmntic   cach's fear  allayed during W&M meet

of its own, and its supposed
advantage on the floor had no
bearing on the outcome.

Pitt began the meet on the
pommel horse, traditionally
considered the most difficult event
to start on, while William and
Mary began on the floor. But
even the unlucky draw couldn’t
keep the Panthers down. They
scored 43.85 on the pommel
horse, the highest score D’Amico
said he’s seen on that event since
he’s been coaching at Pitt.

“After we got that score, I
couldn’t care less what they did
[on the floor] because we were
well on the way,” D’Amico said.

The floor, rings and vault
followed, and Pitt fared well on
each. After four events the
Panthers led by 11. At that point
D’Amico said he knew the team
had the chance to break its all-
time best score of 272 points. But
it was not to be. The final two
events, parallel bars and high
bar, went badly.

“Each one of our guys had at
least one major break on parallel
bars,” D’Amico said. “If we
would’ve had a tight meet, we
would’ve gotten wiped out. Butl
knew we had the meet, and I
didn’t have to worry. But I also
thought ‘Geez, we could break a
score here.’ And that would’ve
been a great experience."

But despite those “major
breaks,” the team still managed
to best every season-high score
from last year, including the
overall team score. In the ﬁnal

Razorbacks rage,
but LeRon is lousy

 

Notes from the world of college
basketball 

-1 still think that Arkansas is
the most dangerous team in the
nation. Nolan Richardson has
assembled a squad which is deep,
talented and determined.
Moreover, the Razorbacks are
defensive-minded, borrowing the
Jud Heathcote theory of
basketball: Rest on offense; work
on defense.

With Lee Mayberry and the
underrated Arlyn Bowers
spearheading the “40 minutes of
hell,” Arkansas can stay with any
team in the country, including
the University of Nevada-Las
Vegas. The game between those
two teams should be a classic.

And speaking of the Runnin’
Rebels, anyone who says coaches
like Jerry Tarkanian and Jim
Boeheim of Syracuse can only
recruit and not coach is quite
misled. Tarkanian’s record proves
his coaching prowess, and if
LeRon Ellis had played like he
did at Kentucky his freshman
year, Syracuse would have been
close to a championship last year,
despite having a freshman point
guard and no consistent outside
shooter. That, my friends, is
coaching.

The obvious fact is that Ellis
and the Big East style of play
don’t mix. In the SEC, he probably
would have been a star, especially
if he had stayed at Kentucky. In
fact, Ellis would have been better
off anywhere but the Big East.

°There is absolutely too much
hand-checking in college
basketball, especially in the Big
East. I think I might actually like
players like Chris Walker of
Villanova ifthey avoided shaking
down opposing guards. Lack of
reﬂexes and footspeed don’t give
a player the right to keep his
hands on his opponent all the
time.

The worst part is that these
little games sometime lead to
pushing and shoving, making the
job of the referee much harder. If
the refs would just call the blatant
“frisking,” it would cut down on
frustration fouls like those really
vicious picks Chris Walker seems
to run into.

°Among the teams I would
like to be among the Top 10 in
coming years: Indiana. Yes, Bob
Knight will do it again soon, with
a team unlike any of his previous
three championship teams. The
foundation of Calbert Cheaney,
Chris Reynolds and even Damon
Bailey will lead the Hoosiers to
many victories.

While some people claim that
Knight is a “traditional” coach, he
always finds new ways to win
with varied players. Cheaney, for
instance, is not your typical
Indiana player, but Knight has
structured the offense around this
multi-skilled forward who is

Derek
Wﬂlis

hardly a Steve Alford imitator.
Another team is Virginia.
Already a Top-20 team, the
Cavaliers are a growing power in
the ACC, along with (brace
yourself) Wake Forest. While I’m
at it, expect DePaul and UCLA to
return to their past forms.
°Over the holiday break, I had
the chance, through the wonder
of cable television, to see Pitt
recruit Orlando Antigua in action.
Although strictly a baseline player
at 6-foot—6 and around 190
pounds, Antigua is a diamond in
the rough. He displayed excellent

leaping ability and defensive D’

intensity, perhaps ticketing him
for duty on the press Pitt now
employs.

Swimmers get tbeir feet wet in preparation for ']VOU6l i

Byjim Lakely

Staﬁ" W1-iter

Coming off a relatively easy victory over
West Virginia last weekend, men’s
swimming head coach Chuck Knoles sees
this Saturday's meet against Villanova as
basically a tuneup for the culmination of
the team’s season: the Big East
Championships.

West Virginia went up against Pitt without
some of its best swimmers because of
disciplinary suspensions. Knoles used his
advantage to test some of his swimmers in
unusual events, perhaps trying to make
up for Pitt’s weakness in the backstroke.
How well Knoles can compensate for his

team’s weaknesses against Villanova is a
good barometer to gauge how successful
the Panthers will be in their postseason,
especially in defending their Big East title.

“Villanova is stronger on backstroke,"
said Knoles, “so we have to dominate in
the other events to make up for that.” Pitt’s
disadvantage in the backstroke also makes
the crucial medley relay suspect, according
to Knoles.

The Panthers are leaving for Villanova
on Saturday morning instead of Friday
night. It will be a real challenge for the
team to endure a five-hour bus ride, then
jump into the pool and compete on a top
collegiate level. But staying focused is
essential in achieving Knoles’ ultimate

goal of qualifying for swimming’s
postseason, the NCAA Championships.

If the NCAAs represented running, then
Pitt swimmers would first have to learn to
walk. That involves swimming fast enough
to qualify for the Eastern Seaboard
Championships in Princeton, NJ. The
swimmers’ last chance to qualify for the
Ivy League—controlled meet will come in
the Big East Championships.

“The Big East Championships will be a
real barn burner with Syracuse and Pitt,”
said Knoles. “It will be real interesting to
see how our swimmers come out.”

Pitt has seven swimmers qualified for
the Easterns, and the added incentive of
defending the Big East title should bring

the best out of the Panthers. At least, that
is the plan.

The swimmers have been shaving their
bodies and tapering their training in
preparation for the meet, but the “pride
factor" also has to be weighed.

“We have been [Big East] champions for
eight years in a row, now,” Knoles said.
“No one wants to be part of the team that
broke the streak.”

PI'I'I‘ BITS: Over the weekend, junior
diver Phil Cruz and freshman diver Sean
Braud both qualified for the NCAA
Championship meet on the 3-meter board.
Cruz also made NCAA cuts on the 1-meter
board.

Bulls to battle boisterous DetroitTurbos for supremacy  

By Ethan Lott
For T be Pitt News

The Pittsburgh Bulls may still
be one of the two best teams in
the Major Indoor Lacrosse League,
as General Manager Haswell
Franklin said last week. But after
Saturday night’s 26-12 thrashing
at the hands of the Detroit Turbos,

it seems apparent which team is
the best.

The Turbos’ 26th goal, which
they scored with two seconds left
in the contest, established a new
MILL record for offensive
explosiveness.

The Bulls entered the game
with high hopes that their strategic
defensive plans would be able to

offense, led by the “twin T urbos,”
Paul and Gary Gait. Pittsburgh
succeeded for the first period,
but then the Detroit offense
kicked intohigh gear.

After the Bulls cut the Detroit
lead to a single goal at 5-4 in the
second period, the Turbos rattled
off eight of the halfs last nine
goals to lead 13-5 at halftime.

Gary Gait was named the
game's MVP as he struck for five
goals and chipped in seven assists.
Paul added another five goals
and three assists. The pair's

teamwork and efficiency were
too much for the Bulls, one of the
league’s better defensive teams
last season.

One of the Bulls’ biggest flaws
was their attempt to maintain
predetermined defensive match-
ups on the turf.. This disrupted
the ﬂow, both offensively and
defensively, and led to several
Detroit breakaway goals.

The loss dropped the Bulls to
1-1 on the season. The Turbos
improved their league-leading
record to 3-0. It also dealt the
Bulls’ playoff hopes a severe blow,

season’s end would probably not
be enough because after head-
to—head matchups the goals
scored/allowed ratio is the next
tie breaker.

Continued from page 10

meet of 1990, Pitt scored 266.75.
This Sunday in the Panthers’
season opener they beat that score
by more than one point. It was
enough to make D’Amico wonder
what's ahead for this team.

“If we get this score up there, I
don't know  I don't even want
to think about it,” he said.

Ultimately the Panthers’ goal is
to score high enough to qualify
for NCAA Regionals and then
hopefully move on to Nationals.

 

D’Amico believes the team has a ‘if

good chance to qualify. To do it,
they'll have to eliminate mistakes.
For now, the team is concentrating
on Saturday's meet at James
Madison University. Pitt will face
William and Mary again, but
despite this weekend's blowout,
D’Amico is not underestimating
his opponent.

“(William and Mary Coach Cliff

Gauthier] served notice that
they're a lot better,” D’Amico
said. “We caught them off-guard
on Sunday. Our guys might think
we can put them away again, but
things could easily go either way.
They could sneak up on us. But
if we get rid of those major breaks,
we should have no trouble,” he
said.
PITT BITS: Genaro Severino
(54.35), Jorge Gonzalez (54.25)
and Daye Bausmith (53.90) placed
first, second and third,
respectively, in the all—around 
Severino also placed first on rings
(9.5), vault (9.4) and high bar
(9.45)  Bausmith tied for first on
pommel horse (8.9) and placed
first on parallel bars (9.35) 
Gonzalez placed first on floor
(9.4) and second on high bar
(9.15)  Brock Freehling placed
second on rings (9.35), and Stuart
Yoss was third on vault (9.1).

THE PITT NEWS» Wednesday. 23, 1991
Robert Morris easy
match for ‘Lady Track’

 

By Sharon Kerestes
stag Writer

“Mission accomplished” was
about all Lady Panther indoor
track coach Steve Lewis could
say after Friday’s meet at Robert
Morris.

It was all he had to say. The
Lady Panthers let their
performances speak for
themselves.

Pitt pulled in eight first places
and three seconds against
competitors from western
Pennsylvania and West Virginia
colleges.

“I feel very good about the
performance. The kids went in
and did very well,” Lewis said.

It wasn’t the kind of
competition Pitt was used to.
The Lady Panthers have typically
faced some of the toughest track
programs in Division I. But
because the competition was
scaled down somewhat, the meet
served a variety of purposes.

For some it was a chance to
work on speed and to test
themselves in certain events. For
others it was excellent pre-
paration for the upcoming meet
at Johnson City, Tenn.

And for the younger and less
experienced competitors, whom
Lewis said are “still in the
developmental stages of their
track careers,” the meet was an

opportunity to get a better handle
on collegiate competition.

“They’re doing well, but it's
kind of hard running and learning
and competing against
accomplished juniors and
seniors,” Lewis said.

. “Sometimes you don’t get a
chance to see yourself. You don’t
get a chance to break that tape
because you’re [always]
competing on that high level."

Pitt’s ﬁrst-place ﬁnishers were
Kim Blair, SS-meter hurdles (8.3
seconds); Jen Mueller, high jump
(5 feet, 4 inches); Joanne Warner,
shotput (42 feet, 3 inches); Stacy
Wyzykowski, mile run (5214);
Cathy Chrissos, 800m (2. 17); Jenil
Santos, 500m (124.6); and Danine
Mitchell, 400m (65.0).

The 4x400 relay team of Laura
O’Donnell, Chrissos, Mitchell and
Santos also placed first with a
time of 4:15.

Second-place ﬁnishers were
O’Donnell, 800m (2.24); Carmella
Marianni, mile run (5.15); and
Jennifer Hrach, 3000m (11.07).

This weekend the Lady
Panthers face their toughest
competition yet, when they join
other eastern indoor-track powers

at Johnson City.
