_ Last Week, the 'Women’s Self—Groverning’ association did
the impossible. It vetoed tradition and acc.ep'ted a bid by pub-
licity» agents to go along with the “My Favorite Brunette,”
contest.

The move on the part of the Women’s group, and the sub-
sequent approval by Student congress, has been dubbed com-
mercialism by some quarters on campus. Whether they are right
in their opinion or not is a mattcrof conjecture. 1

The discussion centering on this particular contest to
determine “a beauty for beauty ’s sake” brings up a more far
reaching issue: “Why can"; Piitt agree with every school of
major importance and condone dance queens and alumni home-
coming queens?”

» Beauty Enough
The argument that Pitt doesn’t have the beauty to offer
can be dispelled with one short. trip? through the Tuck shop.
From our angle, Pitt Women boast enough appealing femininity
for the most critical connoisseur. When girls from the campus
a spend free time modeling for Pittsburgh stores and pa.pers—and
a‘ few go on to modeling on a nationwide scale as in the case
of former editor June ThomsoI1—-—we think Pitt women ‘have it ’.
The ‘commercial angle objection falls ﬂat when the scope of
‘contests in the school. for school affairs is scrutinized. Who can

women.” In Pitt’s colonial days, this was ‘a valid argument;
but, in this modern era, we don’t consider it undigniﬁed or
criminal for a. girl to be be.autif_u.l. ‘

The only argument that might hold Weight——and the one
that is cited continualIy——is that a beauty queen will detract
from the cherished honor of senior queen. '

Senior Queen Above Detraction

Pitt "s senior queen is not selected because of beauty. The
prime reason for her e.xistence is to express the opinion of the

a personality that attracts, and be a “do something girl” in
activities. In high school, she was called the girl most likely
to succeed.

The high ideals of the senior queen position make it im-
possible for any other type of queen-to detract‘ from it. It
would be more accurate to say‘ that the dance queens add to
- the, honor of the: senior queen. '

Pitt. students are forever -calling for, school spirit. Some-
times it comes from the News, decrying such things as the meager
participation in the recent election, and asking what is the
matter. Sometimes the complaint comes from heads of dance

  
 

  

“ more times it comes from the average Pitt student—the one
who goes‘ to school dances and sits in the Tuck shop, but who
has neither the time nor the interest to take a responsible
part in activities. This student would like to say, however, that
he ‘:likes Pitt because there’s_always somethin going on that ‘s
fun. -

Supporters Need a. Boost

This last group of students is the‘ one which will be greatly
aﬁected by any change inthe policy towards “queens” on
, campus. They are not the ones who run things, who make

     
     
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
 

joiners; they are, however, supporters, responsible. for making

“a go of plans laid down by “wheels.”
We feel a loosening up on such policies as the one just men-
tioned, and complete administrative support and encourage-
‘ieht on__any future. plans‘ of this kind, would go a. long way

Editor, Pitt News _
For years both students "and
‘faculty at Pitt have moaned, no

‘campus life, no school spirit—and

done nothing about it. College-
life at Pitt has meant football
games, a few lukewarm dances,
Tuck shop cliques, Owl pictures
of collegiate Women draped around
a ﬁre place, and a handful of
clubs and fraternities. That these
all contribute to a collegiate at-
mosphere may be very true, but
in reality Pitt campus life is
hopelessly inadequate. Ordinary
John Pitt spends his campus life
riding trolleys between school and
Aspinwall, Brentwood, Bellevue or
Squirrel Hill. Each semester he
meets: the ten or dozen people
who sit left and right of him in his
classes.’ For him, Pitt has as much
campus life as the Gulf Building.

‘Such conditions are deplorable

but need not remain so.
Urges Amity .

Last semester Dr. Parker of the
history department held his cus-
tomary “open house” for all class
members at his home. The num-
ber of us who came, the gracious
Doctor and Mrs. Parker treated
to a delicious buffet supper. We

"had the run of the house. We‘

danced, played. bridge, and, best of

all, listened to each others’ ideas

in a “bull session” that ran till
midnight. This get-together‘ rates

‘as a high  0 spot in my life at Pitt.
It would be an imposition. tow ‘
expect all instructors to go to the '_

expense and trouble Dr. Parker
puts himself to. On the other
hand, it is not too much to ask

that more instructors make some i
1e1fort—whether it be to organize

numbers and letters at the top
of a card.

Asks Action A

In a school of over 20,000, school
spirit,‘ if it is to be more than a
term, must be built out of small
units. I do not advocate an “or-
ganized program” within each
school, department, and section.

.Organization in such matters too

often kills the human touch under
a vitiating, mechanical weight.
The new school spirit should be

grass roots. The feeling of close-’

ness and undgrstanding built

within the small units of the sec-.

tions should unite naturally‘ the
members within departments and
echelons. Instructors
should not be coerced into creat-
ing a campus -life, but should act
because they want to act. In doing
so, they would ﬁnd enthusiastic
student cooperation.

Pitt has a gold mine of material
to work with in developirig a real
college a.tmosphere geared to met-

ropolitan living. It is up to the

instructors, the natural leaders by
do
something about it. -

Grants Funds
For Research

Dr. Klaus H. Hofmann, associate
research professor and Dr. A. E.
Axelrod, assistant research pro-
fessor, both of Chemistry depart-
ment, have been granted an ad-
ditional $6300 by the American
Cancer society to continue their
basic research in the ﬁght against
cancer.

Believing that “we cannot hope .

to understand cancer without a
better knowledge", of normal
growth,” Dr. Hofmann and Dr.
Axelrod, in collaboration with Dr.
S. E. Purvis, senior research fel-
low in Chemistry, are studying
the growth effects of some of the
lesser known vitamins.

Much of the research is ce te -
ed around biotin, a vitamin yv ich
greatly ‘effects, normal growth.
Since biotin ‘is also an important
constituent of ‘tumors, and since
cancer is thought to be uncontroll-
ed growth, the doctors feel that
much can be learned from a basic
research of this vitamin.

Dr. Hofmann is the first man to
synthesize oxybiotin, biotin with
its sulfur atom replaced by an
oxygen atom. He then discovered
that oxybiotin and biotin have the
same effect on growth. ‘Dr. Hof-

I mann concluded from this that

the sulfur atom in biotin has no

effect on growth. '
Dr. Hofmann came to Pitt in

1944. He received the doctor of"

‘philosophy degree in chemistry

from the Federal Institute - of
Technology, Zurich, Switzerland.

Phi Ep Title

 Hopes Erased

Practically all season long,
PiKA and the Phi Eps have been
the center of attraction in the in-
terfraternity basketball circuit,

~ but in the ﬁnal analysis it proved

to be the Delts who held the key
to the title race.

The Delts exterminated the title
hopes of the Phi*Eps -by handing
them a surprise 25-19 setback last
Thursday‘ evening at the cathe-
‘dral gym. _,

The Phi-Eps had been dead-

‘locked for ﬁrst place with the

PiKAs who, in the meantime,
were at work drubbing Alpha Phi
Delta, 41-29. The PiKAs are now
second half champions.

Earlier in the campaign, ‘ the
Delts had given‘ PiKA its only de-
feat. Thus, in beating both loop
leaders, they have labeled them-
selves as number one trouble
makers. , _ ’

The Delta Tau -Delta-Phi Ep
game was a low-scoring affair.
Bob Hughes walked off with scor-
ing honors, garnering a meager
eight points. Dick Seewald and
Bruce Gilbert of the Phi Eps were
bracketed at ﬁve markers apiece.

Daddio Signed
At Allegheny '

The district gained another sin-
gle wing adherent when Alle-
gheny college appointed William
(Bill) paddio to head football
coach. It is the ﬁrst top coaching
spot for the former Pitt end.

He coached the Pitt ends in
1939-40 and then put in two sea-
sons as a player with the Chiacgo
Cardinals of the National Foot-
ball league. Following a four-
year hitch in the Navy, Daddio
spent last season as end coach for
the Buffalo entry in the All-
American conference.

Without a doubt, Daddio ranks
as one of the greatest ends in
Panther annals. He ﬂanked the

the Sutherland Scythe when the
Panthers won 25, lost only three,
and were tied twice. '
Includedgin the string was a
21-7 victory over Washington in
the 1937 Rose Bowl game, the
Panther’s ﬁrst victory at Pasa-
dena. »
