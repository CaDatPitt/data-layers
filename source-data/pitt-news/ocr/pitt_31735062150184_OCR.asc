Emphasizing that Friday is

their Owl pictures taken, Sel-
wyn Loeb, BA41, business man-
ager of the 1941 yearbook, to-
day warned potential graduates
to. make their appointments early.

Appointments to have photo-

“The 1941 Owl will contain sev-
eral blank pages in the back-an

album section——-for photographs,
clippings and autographs,” stated
Bill Sheris, BA41, editor.

The picture layout is. tricky, too.

Featuring “you” as its, main
theme, the book is set up in such a
fashion that the large picture of the
individual senior may be seen at
the top of the page, regardless of
what section the publication is
opened to—and it’s all done with
one picture!

G-arlochi coins
Defense Group

Lorena A.‘ Garloch, head of the

U.n.iv.er.si.ty ......1J'.fbrary. .;-_.refer.en£e~.  deg... .

partme_nt_, has been appointed a
member. of. the defense committee
of the Pennsylvania, Library asso-
ciation. V

The committee proposes that the
University library aid in the nation-
al defense program through its study
and organization of all printed ma-
terial relating to national defense.

Miss -Garloch believes that be-
cause of the present crisis, an en-
tirely changed national situation
will present itself as far as library
service is concerned. Because of
this change, special books and a new
type of educational material must
be made available for library "pa-
trons.

An immediate step taken by the
defense committee is the prepara-
tion and distribution of recent au-
thoritative material on citizenship,
democracy, the American way of
living, militarism, and labor.

Mounted Plants, 
Botanical Photos
Feature Exhibit

Two botanical exhibits are; now

on View in the ﬁnevarts gallery on n

the seventh ﬂoor.
The first exhibit is a collection of

pressed and mounted botanical spec—  ‘

jmens collected by Robert Little,
’40, and represents two summers
of research. _

The exhibition includes mounted
algae, ferns, and violets, and proves
that nature is rather adept at cre-
ating designs.

The companion exhibit is a series
of woodcuts and crayon drawings of
plants executed by Boyd Hanna.
These are very petite, amusing and
unbotanical in character.

By Anita Pat Barone-
“‘There are no new startling

’ movements in the world of palettes

and brushes for the public to gape
at.” ‘

So believes Virginia Cuthbert El-
liott, wife of Phillip C. Elliott, as-
sistant professor of‘ ﬁne arts.

This nationally known‘ artist, one
of the -leading contributors to the

American Survey of Painting at Car- _

negie institute, feels that the artist
of today is settling down to more
serious. thought. ' ' ' 9
---“Th‘er'e' seems to be an awareness
in the c'on«temporary artist of what
is going on about him and an interest
in subjects with social signiﬁcance,”
Mrs. Elliott said. A document of
America today is being recorded in
oils by present—day American artists,
she explained.

“Coming Events,” her painting in
the exhibition, shows an interest in
social problems that exist in an in-
dustrial -city such as Pittsburgh.

Ofﬁcial Student Tri-Weekly Newspaper

  

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Monday, November 4, 1940

Mrs. Elliott Sees No Startling
Movements in W-’orld of Art

Subject. matter of the painting was
taken from the Hazelwood section
of the city.

Mrs. Elliott was interested in this
subject because it seemed to furnish
a. contrasting combination of the
natural and unnatural elements.

In the picture an overgrown ﬁeld
struggles for existence in an indus-
trial section. " i 

The title of the picture was taken
from the quotation “Coming events
cast their shadows before them.”
The shadow, Mrs. Elliott said, might
be the shadow of war, because of the
blazing steel m'ills'.‘ _ ‘ '

She feels that the . current ‘ex-
hibition is ‘stimulating and should
appeal especially to Pittsburghers

' who have never had a chance to see

American paintings. ’

Mrs. Elliott believes that art
should be of interest to any student,
for it stimulates creative thinking
and can be a-source of enjoyment
throughout life.

Town Meeting‘.

The "University brouglit forth from the dark-
ness this ruling: that no political candidate may

former executive connnittee of SEA in 0118 Of its
many weak moments. But the student body  a
whole was not consulted, and that particular SFA
was not elected with reference to such a possible
ruling. _

I The Pitt News, believing in real free speech,
requests that these two bodies, the University of
Pittsburgh and SEA, reconsider their questionable
ruling. And until the ruling 1s changed, we ask
that the proper authorities clarify and explain
thoroughly the temporary policy, and that they
make this teinporary policy known to the general
student ‘body. The Pitt News will cooperate to its
fullest power in helping‘ to make known the tem-
porary policy.

But. there can be no question of the importance
of making the campus free for political candidates
and political speeclles.

. The students of the University must be per-
mitted, or must den1and,‘a larger’ freedom of speech
in order that they can openly discuss those prob-
lems which, now more than ever before, have to
be solved by the youth of America.

FDR, ’illkie Have
Company Tomorrow

Tomorrow is election day and believe it or not
there are still some minority parties 011 the ballots.

But the old. deniocratic means of petition will
have to be used by many minority party members.
They were undemocratically pushed off the ballots
in some states and legally prosecuted (or do we
mean persecuted?) in others. Names of some
minority candidates will therefore have to be writ-
ten in on the ballot by the voter. For those stu-
-dents who do not wish to vote for any of the can-
didates printed on the ballot, the right to write
in a name on the ballot is guaranteed.

Of course there is the other alternative ex-
pressed well by Dan Gillmor, of Friday mag-
azine. I

‘/‘It seems to me there are only two choices
left to the voter this November. If he agrees with
the President or \Villkic, then he can take his pick.
If he does not agree with either, then he just can’t
vote. ”

The News urges everybody to vote. And if
your man isn't on the ballot, write his name in.

Incideiitally here are some of the minority party
candidates: Prohibition, Roger Babson (P), Edgar
V. Moorman (VP) ; Socialist, Norman Thomas
(P), Maynard Krucger (VP) ; Socialist Labor.
John ‘W. Aiken (P), Aaron M. Orange (VP) ; Com-
IIllJ.l'1l-‘s‘i., Earl Bl’0\-V’(l‘3l' (P), James V\’. Ford, negro,

Have you ever read Saroyan’?

My name’s Ja-ck, not Saroyan.

Saroyan, my friend, is mad, he is infantile, he is
crude. He is moreover, probably the greatest writer of
our age.

What's that you said about me?

If you will ease off some of that hyper—glandular ac-
tivity, I'll tell you about the erratic Armenian. Have
you ever had childhood yearnings, like wishing you
could fly or be invisible?

I thought you were going to tell me about Saroyan.
Isn’t he the brain who said, “When great numbers of
men are not working, unemployment results?”

That was Joe Louis. About Saroyan, though, be ex-
ploits the childish desire. He becomes enthusiastic over
the taste of California water. He rolls dice and he is
certain he will throw a seven. So he throws a seven.

Where can I ﬁnd the slug? I’ve got two bits says his
childish desires can’t beat my dice.

You have been pampered by the stark realism of the
twentieth century.

I have been beaten by stark realism, I have been
disinherited by stark realism, I have become a class
traitor through stark realism.

Does it matter if you suffer from realism when your.

wounds can be healed by the salve of romanticism?

You mean like having your tooth pulled and then
taking opium? You can see I'm not a. poet.

Obviously, my friend, quite obviously.

From what I’ve read about William Saroyan he has
no social conscience. Is this true?

You’re being unfair, getting back to the subject that
way. Anyhow, though, what do you mean by social con-
science? If it’s walking on the grass in your bare feet
and milking cows, the answer is no.

Cows are certainly social, but I mean, does be ap-

preciate the complex relationships existing between man
and men?

Not by encompassing the world within his two hands.
He does, however, sum up the world quite a bit between
a policeman, a streetwalker, a sailor, and a barber.

He sounds like a writer of the proletariat. Is this
amazing fact a fact?

Is there any such animal as the proletariat? I’ve been
looking for one for years.

The proletariat consisteth of those wage earners who
have nothing to lose but their chains. .Or am I echoing
Engels?

And the capitalist consisteth of those who have noth-
ing to lose but their chain stores. Or am I echoing
Marx?

I don't know who you're echoing, Walter Winchell,
maybe, but I do know that they’ve got plenty more to
lose. Maybe their heads. Or am I echoing Robespierre?

“Echo, echo, shining bright,
How I wonder why you write,
Is it excess of thyroidian,

Or indication of the Freudian?”

So that’s the kind of stuff Saroyan passes off?

Cleverly evading the issue, I ask you your choice for
number one on the literary hit parade.

In literary criticism, Edmund Wilson; in novel, James
Joyce; in history, John Dos Passos; in poetry, Kenneth
Patchen. Who do you see for the fourth race at
Pilmlico?

First of all, you should know that there is no such
thing as the novel, that being merely the name for any
lengthy work that cannot be otherwise classiﬁed. .In
history, I go for Will Saroyan; in literary criticism, Will
Saroyan; in poetry, Saroyan.

Who the hell's Saroyan?

He writes.

So do I.

Stanley Theater

Legs, lots of them, Ben Blue, and some more legs,
skip up and down the Stanley this week as George
White’s Scandals opens the stage show season with a
variety revue featuring a cast of forty. And it’s good.
The chorus wears clothes this year, pans the World’s
fairs for their girl shows, and appears and disappears
between a Chinese girl swing quartette, a tap-dancing
juggler, an adagio team, a quadruple-threat takeoff on
Gypsy Rose Lee, and antics of the colorful Mr. Blue.
The rubber-jointed, bored-face Ben just stumbles onto
the stage and you laugh; and you keep it up throughout
the howl show.

On the screen Edward G. Robinson puts on a nine-
teenth century Steve Wilson for you, wears a Jerry
Colonna mustache, and develops a top-notch news serv-
ice from a little homing pigeon bureau. As Julius
Reuter, Eddie doesnt growl or even scowl very much in
this picture, dedicated to “the Fourth estate
from the managing editor . . to the reporter.” It
keeps your interest all the way.

The stage attraction alone is worth the price of ad-
mission, but the movie isn’t just an also ran. To-

gether they make for a gala opening of the big show
season in Pittsburgh.——-R. A.

Professors’ Interest in Party
Wanes, Socialist Leader Says

By Sidney Grossman

There is an increasing interest in
the Socialist party on the part of
college students, but there is a de-
crease in the interest of college
professors, Norman Thomas, Social-
ist party leader, said Friday night.

“I ‘am encouraged,” he said in an
interview following a campaign ad-
dress in Carnegie Institute last Fri-
day night, “I am encouraged by
the increasing interest of college
youth in the Socialist movement. On
the other hand, though, there is a
decrease in the interest of college
professors. A good many of them
are ready to ﬁght to the last drop
of undergraduate blood.

“I did not receive any request to
speak at Pitt,” he declared when
asked if he had been invited to talk
at the proposed Pitt town meeting
forum last Friday. “However, I

Opinions

In the Papers

How serious and how immediate
is the “triple threat” to America
‘rom Rome, Berlin and Tokyo? Col-
legiate editorials are speculating
freely these tense days, and their
near—unanimity of opinion is re-
markable.

Recent decision of the three fascist
powers to collaborate more closely,
reasons the Tech, published at Mass-
achusetts Institute of Technology,
“is designed to prevent the United
States from entering the conﬂict by
threatening a war on two fronts if
we keep extending our help to
Gl""-Vi.‘ Britain.”

The Butler Collegian feels that
“this uenlucracy should continue
economic aid to Great Britain, for
only the maintenance of the British
1~°"v will enable the U. S. navy to
remain in the Paciﬁc ocean. The
t-....,« l.llJ’€'dL<;'IlS the United States
only when this nation decides to do
what Hitler and his colleagues wish
us to do——be negative, cease to
stnengtlien the British military ma-
chine, and let Japan go about her
imperialistic way, uninterrupted."

The Eastern Teachers College
(Il1.) News advises that “our best
answer to the pompous threat of the
totalitarian powers is to ignore it.
Continue to increase our aid to Eng-
land and China, who seem to be
keeping the dictators fairly busy at
the present time, and make ourselves
strong at home.”

The New Mexico Lobo likewise
calls upon America to stiﬂe its hys-
teria about the newest phase of Axis
diplomatics. The alliance, agrees
the Lobo, just “isn’t news.” These
three nations have been informally
in a state of cohesion since Germany
began its ambitious onslaughts, and
the mere addition of a theoretical
formality to a known actuality
should be no reason for additional
jitters.” '

The Michigan Daily believes that
Japan in recent days “has executed
one of the most precipitous back-
downs in diplomatic history.
Whether the Nipponese will persist
in sneak aggressions and covert
grabs under their apologetic smoke
screen remains to be seen. In any
event, prevailing ideas about the
importance of ‘face” in Oriental
psychology need revision.”

Jeffries Speaks at YW
Upperclass Luncheon

YWCA Upper Class Luncheon
club will have its weekly meeting

cording to Wilma Swank, C42, chair-

have spoken at a l.ot of colleges late-
ly—-Northwestern, the University of
Chicago, Michigan State, Wayne
University and a lot of others.”

The Socialists, he added, do not
single out youth from other groups.
“We are in favor of NYA and other
forms of aid, but we want to build
up the whole country, not just cer-
tain groups. By improving the
welfare of the people, we will aid
youth.”

In his speech in a half-empty
lecture room in the Institute, Thom-
as waded into both political par-
ties. “They remind me,” he stated,
“of Tweedledee and Tweedledum-—-
you can’t tell them apart.

“Wendell Willkie,” he said, “was
nominated by the grass root farm-
ers of New York. At the Demo-
cratic convention the voice of the
people came from the basement via
sewer inspector Kelly.”

Leonard Shatzkin, editor of the
Tech Tartan, presided at the meet-
mg.

Sidelines

Writli Bill McElwain
Sports Editor

This business of coaching from the sidelines is all very con-
fusing. It seems that Mr. Carl Siiavely, who coaches a football
team at Cornell university, has been accused of signaling plays
from the bench during a game with Ohio State university. That
the accuscrs are various persons connected with the Ohio State
team and that Cornell won the game and that the at'ore-mentioned
accusers didn’t think to say anything about Hi‘. Si1avely’s 
meanor until after Cornell had won the game is all purely coin-
cidental.

VVhetlier or not Mr. Snavely was guilty of such indiscretions
we are unable to  but the subject has brought up a number
of questions. First of all, if Mr. Snavely's signals were so obvi-
ous, why didn’t the gentlemen on the Ohio State squad see tliein,
too, and stop Cornell’s plays?

Too S portsmanlike?

Of course, it c.aii be argued that knowing what's coming and
doing something about it are two different things. However, the
Ohio State team seems to have been rather inystiﬁed by Coi-nell’s
actions most of the time; had they been so well acquainted with
the plays a.s they claim, it is doubtful whether Cornell’s magic
would have worked against them with such success. There is the
possibility that the Ohio State boys were too sportsmanlike to take
advantage of the information supplied them unintentionally; this
is, of course, just a possibility, running contrary to all the laws
of man, nature, and particularly football.

A second and perhaps more important question is whether
or not Mi-. Snavely’s purported unconventionalities are unusual in
football. The answer, we hasten to add, is no. Coaching from the
sidelines has been a highly developed art for a number of years.
Some coaches have done it with the aid of a program or a piece
of paper, those with l.arge squads send in substitute quarterbacks
every time they get brainstorins, and others have gone to the ex-
treme of using student managers.

The Managers Do It

This last method is quite interesting, and requires a large
managerial staff. It operates like this: if nianager Jones walks
up a.nd down in front of the bench, it means an end run; if inan-
ager Smith walks up and down in front‘ of the bench, it means a
reverse; if manager Finkelstein walks up and down in front of
the bench, it means a punt.

If all the managers walk up and down in front of the bench,
it means it ’s a cold day am} they are trying to keep warm.
This splendid system also has its drawbacks. The coach must

I be sure that each manager is distinctive-looking eiioug-¥h to be seen

by the players on the field. \Ve once knew a coach who tried to
signal with two student managers who were twins. After two
weeks all his quarterbacks were neurotic.

Still a third important consideration is whether a coach can
count on his team successfully running the plays he signals. There ’s
many a slip between huddle and touchdown, and all of the slips
-can’t be blamed on poor blocking or sl.ipshod running. Just this
season a coach sent in a reserve quarterback for the express pur-
pose of calling a pass play. Three running plays followed, and a
new quarterback went in without the pass having been thrown.
‘The coach no longer trusts anyone. ‘

As we said before, it ’s all very confusing.

Practice Sessions Open Today

In WAA Intramural Program

Practice periods for the tourna-
ments in the new WAA intramural
program begin today.

Two-hours practice is the only
requirement for participation. In-
structors in both sports will be in
the Cathedral gym.

The tournament itself begins No-
vember 18. Volleyball supremacy
will be decided among various class
teams, while archery contestants will
enter individually in an open tourn-
ament.

Practice periods are not tryouts,
for any girl who fulﬁlls this require-
ment will be eligible for competi-
tion.

Practices will take place at the
following hours:

Volleyball:

Monday, 4:30-5:30.
Wednesday, 3:30-4:30.

Tuesday, 1:30-2:30.
Wednesday, 12:30-1:30.
Thursday, 1:30-2:30.

Before practicing, each participant
must ﬁll out the accompanying en-
try blank stating which tournament
she wants to enter. Applications
should be submitted to the Cathe-
dral gym or to a member of the in-
tramural committee as soon as pos-
sible.

Irma Hotz, Ed41, is directing the
program. Mary Hilda Fagan, Ed41,
is in charge of volleyball, and Patsy
Deans, Ed41, heads the archery com-
petition.

Purpose of the program, accord-
ing to Adele Yorio, Ed41, WAA
president, is to give Pitt women a
chance to take part in athletic ac-
tivities during the school year.
Other sports will probably be add-

Archery: ed to the program later this year.

Rifle Team Coach

Selects Managers

Riﬂe team coach, Lt. William R.
Havlak, assistant professor of mil-
itary science and tactics, has an-
nounced as team managers for this
year, Ralph M. Hines, Ecl42; Vincent
Matera, C43; and Richard Stein,
C43.

The appointments, made last
week, will go into effect at the start
of the shooting season which will
begin the latter part of November.
Match schedules, already under way,
will be completed by Christmas.

A pre-season inventory of the
Riﬂe squad, as a whole, indicates
prospects of a fairly successful sea-
son. Many of the newcomers as well
as the veterans have had previous
experience in the precise art of
target shooting.

Tough Contests Slated
On Today’s Frat Card

Four teams face elimination from
the IF touch football race today
after being held in suspense by Fri-
day’s postponements. The Sigma
Chi’s are scheduled to tangle with
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon squad
while the Sammies will try to repeat
an earlier victory over the Pi Lamb-
da Phi lads.

The Sammies have been defeated
once this year; their nemesis being
the boys from the Pi Kappa Alpha
house w ho downed them 13 to 0. But
the Sammies have several outstand-
ing players in Artie Hurwitz, Red
Silverman, and “Big Hack” White.

Although the Pi Lambda Phi
squad couldn’t do it the ﬁrst time
they met their opponents, they baw
their hopes of a surprise victory
against the Sammies this time on
the ability of Larry Katz and Hill-
ard Kreimer.

This contest is scheduled for ﬁeld
one at 4 o’clock.

In the second contest of the day,
the SAE team will be ﬁghting to
remain in the IF competition by try-
ing to down a strong Sigma Chi
seven.

The Fijis are the only team that
has defeated the Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon squad this season. But consid-
ering the opposition they gave the
Fijis, those who should know are
giving the SAE’s a better than even
change to down the Sigma Chi’s.

Meanwhile, a glance at the record
of the Sigma Chi squad shows that

T

 

8:15

 

it has been blemished only by the
Lambda Chi .Alphri’s. So today's
game at 3 o’clock on ﬁeld one should
be quite a contest.

A third touch football game to-
day has the Golden Bears battling
the Cherokees at 5 o'clock on ﬁeld
two. Having already been defeated
by the Continuity Club, the Chero-
kees are basing their hopes of a
victory on the outstanding ability
of Paul Kurham.

Highlighting tomorrow's intramu-
ral contests will be the Phi Kappa,
Lambda Chi Alpha game. The
Lambda Chi’s are favored in this
one due to the fact that the Phi
Kappa squad has already been de-
feated by the Phi Gams.

The Phi Delt’s chances of a vic-
tory over the Delta Tau Delta seven
depends on the style of play of their
mainstay, Del Anderson.

Phi E ps Defeat
Deli Gridders
In Hard Game

In a hard fought Thursday game,
Phi Epsilon Pi defeated the Delta
Tau Delta seven, 8-2.

The Delts last charging line kept
Wally Hirsch and Alex Zelenski
from strutting their stuff, but lack
of a good passer kept the DTD’s
from the winning column.

The opening score came when
Delt captain Newbury fumbled in
the end zone, after being hit by
Deutlebaum. The Phi Eps tallied
again when Schechter intercept-ed
Lewis’ pass and ran 50 yards for the
game’s only touchdown.

The only Delt score was made
when Zelenski was tagged behind
his own goal after intercepting a
pass from Lewis.

In another match the YMCA team
defeated the Variety club in a thrill-
ing contest, 8-7.

With but 59 seconds left in
ﬁrst half, Frank Goelz threw far
down the ﬁeld to Bob Foliart for
the only Variety score. Nichols ran
around right end on a reverse from
Goelz for the conversion.

After the half-time kickoﬁ, two
points were given to the Y when
Nichol’s pass from center sailed into
the end zone.

With only four minutes left to
play, K-elly intercepted Goelz’s pass
and ran 30 yards for the winning
score.

The Golden Bear team continued
on its way to the title with an easy
victory over the Newman club, 13-0.

Bill Morton showed the way with
two passes. good for touchdowns,
one to Curtis and the other to Ar-
rington. Carter made the single
conversion on a run to the right.

The Chem Fresh lost to the
AE&ME in a fast contest, 25-0.

A sleeper pass from Trocki to
Schutte netted the first score, and
then Trocki and Schutte ran over
from the two and 20 yard lines for

ling performance against the Car-
iiegie Tech Tartans a week ago.

The Slippery Rock outfit is not to
be regarded lightly as the Rockets
have been coming up fast in recent
years. Last fall the Pitt junior var-
sity harriers downed the Teachers
17-38 on their home layout, but the
score fails to indicate the narrow
inargin in the calibre of the two
teams.

Boasting a 17-38 victory over the
Skit;-o harriers, the Rockets will at
least prevent the Blue and Gold
thinclads from running up a perfect
score. Captain Eddie Rogers will
give Zeke Sterner some competi-
tion for at least part of the chase.

Saturday, the Lions from Mt. Nit-
tany invade the Schenley park lair
of the Panthers and seek to continue
their domination over Pitt hill and
dalers. This jinx outﬁt merely has
to appear, and the Pittites respond
by folding.

Last fall the Lions lost every con-
test until their duel with Pitt, but
they trounced the Panthers. Led
this year for last time by captain
Willy Smith, coach Chick Werne-r’s
boys are favored to trip the locals.

Counted on most heavily to avenge
this long list of defeats and to end
the tragical spell of the Penn
Staters, are Sterner and co—captain
Frank McCabe. Sophomore Mark
1—\.ll.7'as has improved with each meet
and may be the difference between
victory and defeat. Junior Johnny
Brosky and sophomore Bob Davis
round out the first ﬁve now, but let-
terman Bob Graham is trying to
crash this quintet.

Opening of Italian Room
Scheduled Next Month

For Latest in Nationality Series

The Italian room, eleventh in the series of University nationality
rooms, will be opened early in December, but the ofﬁcial dedication of
the room will not take place until a later date, the SFA Italian room

Reason for the delay in the official dedication, according to the com-

mittee, is that the room will not be
entirely completed for some time.
A fresco decorating the rear wall
of -the room cannot be painted in
the very near future. Aside from
the fresco, the room will be com-

l_et,ed and available for use within
the next few weeks, committee
members said. ,

V Vhen number 158 was drawn out
of a ﬁshbowl in Washington last
week, those three digits took their
place among the long list of num-
bers which have been signiﬁcant in
the development of America, ac-
cording to Dr. Russell J. Ferguson,
associate professor of history.

l\/[any numbers have ﬂashed across
the horizon of American history,
each carrying with it a singular
meaning and connotation to the
historian.

Most people are aware of the co-
incidental relationship of the fate-
ful 158. to 258,.the first number
drawn in the draft of the first World
war. Yet, there was little said about
either of these two numbers in com-
parison to the furore number 329
created in the latter pa.rt"’6f*%‘flie last.
century‘ "Awhen‘*_—‘;l*a’mes A. Garﬁeld
was running for the presidency.

Garﬁel_df‘was accused by his op-

__ponents""of having made $329 in

‘shady’ bond dealings with the
"Credit Mobilier,” and as a result
the number 329 was chalked,
scratched, and painted on every
sidewalk, building, and fence in dis-
tricts which opposed him.

Perhaps the mos.t stirring use of
numbers ‘came in the patriotic cry
of the early 1800’s'~—-“54-40 or fight!”
This slogan .was_ used to bolster the
American, side of a boundary dis-
pute with_Er.=gland_ over the north-
western area of the United States.

In 1800, the’falteringilfederalist
party hailed 13 Pennsylvania sena-
tors as “the stalwart 13,” in recog-
nition of the efforts of the 13 men
to block the unanimous. election of
Thomas ‘Jefferson. The Federalist
used this motto to help revive their

party morale.

“Sixteen—to--one” was another
numerical milestone in American
history, used in the famous silver
campaign between Bryan and Mc-
Kinley at the turn of the century.

The “.four—fifths compromise” in
the American constitutional ques-
tion of counting slaves for propor-
tional representation in the house
of representatives is another exam-
ple of how an ordinary number
can suddenly ﬁnd itself in the na-
tional spotlight.

With the rising public conscious-
ness of the need for national de-
tense, the American battle slogan
of the late 1790’s—“Millions for de-
fense, but not one cent for tribute,”
comes to mind. _ ~ .

When the ‘gold rush came, and
thousands of Americans left the
east in a westward wave, still an-
other number leit the realm of
mathematics and entered the his-
tory books. We still, refer to the

whole group: of migrants as.“the

49ers.” _

Nuiribers have"oft'e‘n been used
in a derogatory sense to "belittle
some opponent. Adver-saries of

James Buchanan gave him the title .-

o;t' “10-cent Jimmy,” while foes of

the Supreme court have dubbed that
Woodrow ‘

body the “nine old men.”
Wilson caused quite a storm when
he protested that his peace plan was
being defeated by “11 willful sena-
tors.” A

One can hardly think of Wilson
without recalling his far-reaching
“14 points,” another ‘example of how
a‘ number becomes identiﬁed with
an historically important situation.

construction days following the Civil
