Journalism Prof
Battles Fire
In Waste-Basket

Journalism Professor Robert
X. Graham, with the aid of an
intelligent student, fought a
ﬁre in his waste basket re-
cently. 0

Two seconds after the prof
tossed a still-burning match
into the basket, - the student
informed him that a large
amount of paper there ap-
peared to be on fire.

Thinking. to smother the
ﬂames, Mr. Graham turned
the basket over, but the con-
ﬂagration would not be denied.
He pulled the basket away,

- and the student beat out the
ﬂames with a cushion which

lay conveniently on a nearby
chair.

Press Plans

Two W7orks

The University of Pittsburgh

Press today has two major works
in the planning stage. ‘

The larger is a botanical study
of western Pennsylvania and the
upper Ohio River valley. It will
be published in two folio-size vol-
umes and will sell for $50 per set.
The books will contain 200 water
color illustrations of regional ﬂora.

A biography of John McMillan,
“father of Presbyterianism,” is the
other major work now being plan-
ned.

McMillan’s position as a west-
ern Pennsylvania historical ﬁgure
is in line with the Press’ policy of
conpentrating on local history. .

Most recently published works
of the University Press are
“Longevity of Manufacturing Con-
cerns in Allegheny County,” by
Dr. William W. Frasure, associate
professor. of accounting; and “For-
eign Exchange Equilibrium,” by
Dr. John T. Walter, assistant pro-
fessor of ﬁnance.

Published May 1, these were
the ﬁrst two books in the Press’
new monograph series. '

-vLEIZER_ BALK
‘ Glutton for Punishment

l O o I

By having the Owl ready for
distribution on Tap Day two years
in a row, Leizer has restored the
Owl’s reputation, damaged badly
by six years of missed deadlines.
The year before he took over, the

 

 

lgtallced,-1 Owl on nu...

Owl, promised for May, came out
in August.

The 2,000 pictures and 416 pages
that make up the 1952 Owl will
‘offer a permanent chestful of
memories for every purchaser.
None will be crammed as full as
Leizer’s own six-pound volume.

1 Funny Animal

The Owl is a funny kind of an-
imal among Pitt activities. The
book, contrary to its name, is no
ﬂy-by-night operation.

Staff members work for a full
year, sleepy day and bright day,
without any reward except the
satisfaction of hard work, friend-
ship and loyalty.

tLeizer is not a journalism ma-

jor. He is a chemical engineering‘

student, member of the breed of
men from the upper campus who
seldom ﬁnd time to spend in ac-
tivities. ’
Works at Post Oﬁice

Yet besides, putting in as much
as forty hours a week as editor,
Leizer has paid school expenses
for the past two years by working
30 hours each week at the Pitts-
burgh post-ofﬁce. C «

He will graduate on time, a feat
for any publications editor, with
a B-minus average, just a shade
below the 1.8 QPA he wanted
badly to qualify for tapping to
Omicron Delta Kappa, which
gave him a special achievements
award earlier this spring.

Frantic ‘Two Weeks

‘ Balk says his most frantic two
weeks was the fortnight before
Saturday, Jan. 19. Working with-
out sleep to meet a 100-page dead-
line that day, he was also chair-
man of the ﬁrst High school pub-

lications Institute which broughtl

900 teen-age journalists to Pitt
that morning. .
’ Leizer also found time to con-
tribute to the Skyscraper Engi-

neer, Pitt’s technical magazine,

and he is a member of the E&M
Association and the American In-

Seniors Smoke, /

Frosli Burn

If you are a freshman coed, the
chances are you will disapprove
of smoking in classrooms according
to the results or the Associated
Collegiate Press National Student
Poll. On the other hand, if you
are a senior or a graduate student,
you will probably approve of
smoking during class sessions, or
not be affected one way or the
other; ’

The most frequently mentioned
reason for opposition to class room

‘smoking seems to be consideration

for non-smokers. Some students,
smokers themselves, seem to fear
it for safety purposes. However a
senior at Florida State University
summed up his opinion in two
words, “I smoke.”

‘ Weare afraid that the committee will not

tee andof the larger board are likely to want
‘ the new magazine to be a vehicle of their
own conservatism and exaggerated fears of

.. This timorous attitude may prevail in
spite of the fact that the committee has only
‘one clear-cut negating duty—to see to it that
 the new magazine keeps within the bounds

 grey ﬂannels, six repp ties, a broad smile, -and a_
‘crew cut that gives him a somewhat baldish ap-
pearance. Usually he is not quite sure where next
month’s dues are coming from. i
. . ,Like an increasing number of

concerned about the role of fra-

to give story and style ideas to go into a
good magazine.

A basic requisite for a high quality sheet
is the permission to handle a wide range of
subjects. Another‘ requisite is the permission
toeuse a “light touch,” which seems to be a
much-feared’ item on this campus. '

Because of innate reactionism, lack of in-.

formation, or distrust of the student capabili-
ty, some members of the committee and the

board would rather not grant these two re-
quisites to the new mag. It is that fear of ’
okaying a vigorous publication that we are»,

worried about, more than we are concerned
about not having good reading matter next
year.j P . 

=l< * *

If the committee decides to withhold these
important (and really not so dangerous) re-
quisites from the new magazine, to closely
circumscribe the subject matter and style,
they will be indulging in censorship just as
certainly as if they blue-pencilled the copy

that goes into each .edition. And, for all

their good intentions, they will have a spine-
less, innocuous, readerless magazine. Stu-
dent readers would grow surpassingly weary
of feature articles extolling the virtues of
the YWCA, the University Press, and the
Syria-Lebanon_Room. «- ‘ . _ .

When a large number of ‘students object-
ed to the Panther’s “off-color” material and
sought changes in ,policy, they did not want
or” expect the Panther’s- successor to be de-
prived of any legitimate vigor or entertain-
ment potential. The committee andthe board
will not be serving the wishes of even the

emasculated student magazine. ’

zations, unwilling to lose local chapters, will drop
the exclusion clauses. This, he continues will be
the case in his own fraternity, which in the ‘national
by-laws has an exclusion clause. V ’ P
“Fraternities,” Forst argues, “should pick whgm
they choose without interference from a national
group. If any groups continue to flagrantly dis-
criminate, the University shbuld withhold recog-

To F-orst’s and Rabinowitz’s arguments, the most
likely rebuttal will be the assertion that, with or
without the clauses‘: things will remain the same;
if the clauses are abolished, the “selection” will
go on behind the scenes. Furthermore, now is not
the time. Such action as the proposed withdrawal
of recognition, according to this / point of view,
would be not only useless but possibly harmful.

Forst’s answer is that, while little can be done
to alter informal ethnic or religious discrimination,
at least under his plan local groups would be free
to do as they please, while‘ now their hands are
often tied. “It would be a concrete step forward”
he says. i _ ~

How MC members will greet the motion is
hard to forecast. Probably action on the matter
will be postponed. For once Men’s Council has a
chance to favor something a little more signiﬁcant
than the compulsory wearing of dinks by frosh.
The fresh, as well as a good many upperclassmen,
will be watching their decision. ' '

Send My Kidito Pitt?

ED JENSEN

It is unfortunate that the ﬁnal
issue of the Panther should have
been one of the best that un-
happy crew across the hall ever
put out. If it had been as bad as
“True Concessions,” few of its
optimistic readers would have
lamented i t s
fate. But is-E
was good andj
if the New-
ma n s were
daring enough
t o s k i m
t h r onu g h
someone else’s
copy,they
must now feel
a little sheep-
i s h a b o u t
their “wow—
ser” tactics. This of-course, ap-
plies to those bastions of ‘moral-
ity, Student Congress, Men’s
Council and WSGA Senior Court,
all of whom were quick to detect
the “degrading” effect of the
Panther on our morals and our
enrollment.

 

I suppose I shall be accused of

partiality towards that last Pan-
ther because it contained. an ar-
ticle written by me. Candidly,
this does have something to do
with it, but my prejudice comes
not from a happy ego but rather
from the pleasure of seeing a
campus publication handle, a
subject calculated to arouse
something other than‘ snickers
from "the sophomores. The fea-
ture in which I collaborated with
ﬁve other seniors, posed the in-
teresting and highly pertinent
question “Would You Send Your
Children to Pitt?” The new mag-
azine’ (nameless and undeﬁned
as yet) should make a point of
running features of this nature.

For the Newmans and others
who may not have seen the -Wed-
nesday Panther, six seniors told
why they would or would not
send their, young to Pitt. I join-
ed with the three who expressed
a desire to send their children
elsewhere; all of us happy’ in the
conviction that we might some-
day have the money to afford
such a luxury. Now I should like
to elaborate on the points at
which “I could only hint in the.
Panther.

Natural, Deficiencies? ..

The size of this University, its
geographical location in the
heart of a metropolitan area and
its lack of a cohesive campus are
all part and parcel of one failing,

At Full Strength
According to Olson, the only

it’s a different situation-the team

There’s a good reason why Coach Ralph Mitter-
ling shiftedthe 21-year old junior to right ﬁeld,
and the shift has paid off in base hits.

Strategic Move

a When the season started, Mitterling wanted to
keep Nieniela in the lineup because of his hitting,
but also wanted to make a catcher of freshman
Milt Emery, a natural-looking prospect who came
up as a second-baseman. ,

As it turned out, Emery more than ﬁlled the
bill as a receiver, and the outﬁeld was strength-
ened considerably with the addition of Niemela.

Both are better off in their new capacities and, ,
along with freshman Bob Kyle, take care of the ’
power hitting on the squad. - ,

Satisﬁed in Outﬁeld . 4

“Although I feel more in the game behind th
bat,” says Niemela, “I get more rest in the out-
ﬁeld, which is a big help sometimes.”

The Fayette City six-footer is well satisﬁed with
his new _position, and is willing to stay there if it
helps the team.

Flychasing may be new to the lad, but baseball
has been his meat since he was 15 and a student
at Marion high "school. He catches for Fayette City
during the summer.

Deserves Promotion

The biggest joke of this man,
who is termed the biggest joke in
Pittsburgh, came after the Penn
State game last winter, when there
was a rumor of his resigning.
When I asked Carlson about the
Scuttlebutt, he replied, “Why
there’s nothing to it, I’m good for
another 15 years.”

My own opinion on the man
whose outlook on life is a sure
cure for worry, is that his talents
are being wasted. »

I He should ‘be promoted to an
assistant Athletic Director’s post.

terial that would enter Pitt once

Yes, Carlson, who often calls his
ball players clowns, is an ainusing
man.

 , Summer Camps Offer Students
 Chance for Fun, Worthyi Job

Wanna’ get away from home
this summer? If you’re stuck for a
place to go you might try one of
the foreign summer work camps
that have become popular since
the end of the war.

There you can have fun and
make yourselfuseful at the same
time. They are camps in which
people from all over the world
work on such worthwhile projects
as the construction, and repair of
churches, schools, and community

a centers.

Some Church-Sponsored

Some of the most popular of
these camps" are those sponsored
by ‘the Youth Department of the
World Council of. Churches.

They are called ecumenical, or
interdenominational camps, and
they have facilities located
throughout Europe, Asia, and Af-
rica. -In Germany, for instance,
the campers of this group are go-
ing to excavate the foundations
for the Gossner Mission, a home
for students and training center
for missionaries and laborers.

Cost U13 To $1000
Applicants to these camps should
speak the French or German lan-

guages for European work, and

preferably, summer work experi-

D Bias Rules

Exclusion clauses in fraternal’

and other campus groups come

under ﬁre again today. Mel Forst, ,

‘amember of Men’s Council, will
propose to the men’s governning
body that it urge the University
to withhold recognition from any
groups having the clauses.
Forst’s motion states that:
, ,“Because discriminatory prac-

tices are inconsistant with basic ~

democratic ideals, Men’s Council
of the University of Pittsburgh is
opposed to Vcla-uses of exclusion in

‘ . the constitutions and charters of

mens’_ student organization; and
recommends that the administra-
tion withdraw recognition from
any such groups that fail to re-
move the clauses.”

Forst claimed that the exclusion
clauses constituted a‘ “pressing
problem” that needs “immediate
attention.” ‘a

The president of Council, Ron

.Ecker, said the spirit of the pro-

posed recommendation should be
“an aim for future student gov-
ernipg groups” to accomplish, and
added that he believed a consensus
of Council opinion showed that
“the motion will not be passed be-
cause of the great number of pos-
sible organizations it might take
in.” .
Ecker stated that he thought it
likely the motion would in some
way be postponed for further
study on the whole situation.

The Council meeting, which is
open to all students, takes place at
3:30 p.m. in room 832 C1.

ence. Cost for a four to six weeks
stay runs from $650 to $1000.

The American Friends Commit-
tee also backs a summer work
camp project called the Interne
Program, which carries on work
similar to the ecumenical groups.
“ Yussuf Ibrahim, president of the
International Club, attended some
of these Interne camps in his na-
tive India in the summer of 1949.
He divided his twelve weeks time
between camps i.n Bombay, Poona,
and Madras.

Lots of Fun

dents and advisers doing clerical
work and manual labor, and re-
ports that it was a lot of fun.
“There was no such thing as
a strict leader in our camps,”
he says, “our advisers, all ex-
perts in their ﬁelds, took part
in all our’ activities as one of the
campers.”

One of the big jobs the campers
in Madras had was trying to break
down the caste that existed among
the natives there.

. Tried to Teach

“We tried to teach the children
that we were people from all over,
living together as friends and
without discrimination, and that
they, as townspeople, should prac-

He worked with 200 other stu-

tice the same goodwill,” he said.
Campers Pay Half
Interne campers pay half their

expenses and work out the other 1.

half. For twelve weeks the cost
comes to about $200.

Work camps provide a ﬁne op-
portunity to promote international
understanding and bring an end,
as Ibrahim says, to petty bicker-
ing and individualism. Besides
that, the group associations, the
worthy..projects, and the across-

boundary friendships all add up
to an unforgettable experience.

Extra Yearbooks
Now Available

A few copies of the 1952 Owl
are still available to students who
did not order the yearbook dur-
ing the year.

Owl business manager'Marvin
Jacobson urges all students who
have not picked up their yearbook
to do so as soon as possible so
that records may be cleared up.
The 829 C1 Owl office will be open
from 9:30 a.m. ot 4 p.m. for this
purpose.

Plant Emphasis Bad K

This preoccupation with plant
expansion and technical and
graduate education has other, not
so obvious effects. In order to
ﬁnance these necessarily expen-

_ sive programs, the University is
gradually being forced to curry _

the favor of the monied interests
in the city. In the past this
money was usually forthcoming
from private families, who gave
from a feeling of responsibility
and whose conception of educa-
tion was largely classical in na-
ture. Their money was not given
with any implied political or
sociological strings attached.
Now, nowever, much of the
money that is contributed must
come from corporation officers
whose interest in maintaining the
status quo transcends anything
Andy Carnegie ever dreamed,
mainly because they are now on
the defensive and because ev-
erything we now do of a public
nature must apparently be, in-
tegrated with private enterprise.
And we are beginning to work
with the corporations themselves,

cause the government would
