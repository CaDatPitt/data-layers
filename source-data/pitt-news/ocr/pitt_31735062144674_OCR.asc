Characterized As Tireless
This assembly follows the me-

' Y. ._W. C. A. Members of the alumni

council will attend in a body, stated
W. C. Arther, president of Alumni
Council.

»_Dr. McCormick has been charac-
terized by those who knew him as a
man of “tireless energy, kindliness,
and true courage”; a man “whose
soul passion was the upbuilding of
his University”; a man “who gave
himself tirelessly and unceasingly for
the advancement of the cause of the
public as well as higher education.”

‘ "Born in 1858 of one of the most

rominent families in the Ligonier
alley, Dr. McCormick received
muchof his primary education from
his father, thenentering Washing-
ton and Jefferson College at the age
of eighteen. He was graduated from

_tliat school with‘ highest honors at

the age of twenty-two. Three years
later he received the degree of Mas-

ter: of Arts from Washington-and
- Jefferson.

4 Turns From Law to Ministry

After his graduation from college,
Dr. McCormick wascappointed to the .‘
‘faculty of Canonsburg Academy and

later" -to -the.-facul~ty.‘of- Washington
and.Jfefl’erson as, rofessor of Greek.
In“1_882 he was a mitted to the Alle-
gheny County Bar, and practiced law
in Pittsburgh until 1887, when, feel-
ing that his life should be given to
the ministry, rather than law, he en-.
tered the Western Theological Semi-
nary at Pittsburgh.

' Graduating from - that institution

in;1890, Dr. McCormick became pas-
tor of the Central Church of the
North Side. He held that position
until 1894, when he accepted the call
of First Presbyterian Church of
Omaha.

In 1897, resigning from his posi-
tion in the Omaha church, Dr. Mc-
Cormick became president_ of Coe
College, continuing in that position

Dr. Florence Teagarden, ‘Resource F riend,’,

Is One Of Busiest Instructors On Campus

ER brisk step, her crisp way of.
H speaking, her efficiency, are

likely to frighten you, as ef-
ﬁciency often does. Yes, it may-, if
you don’t really know Dr. Florence
M. Teagarden, assistant professor of
psychology.

Those who know her intimately
are fond of teasing Dr. Teagarden
about this business-like, demeanor;
they think it is just adopted for use
on the campus.

Perhaps this is true; certainly her
apartment is not the‘ kind that gen-
erally characterizes a business
woman.
just the right shade in draperies and
the armchairs in exactly the right
position. Should you drop in during
an evening, you would be tempted to
pick up a magazine and draw up
another chair, as Miss Teagarden
sits opposite, with head phones “ on
her ears, and the Pittsburgh Sun-
Telegraph across her lap.’ Her
friends say that she buys this paper
just to read “Merely Mar y,” who
is “just the best thing t at ever
happened.”

Her home seems to be a hobby of
Dr. Teagarden’s, although she says
she enjoys riding in the country
even more. But her friends believe
that she loves children best. While
walking along the street she delights
in stopping mothers and listening to
a recital of the wonders of baby.
She even takes time to play with
the youngsters.

Perhaps this is one reason Dr.
Teagarden has so many friends; but
else wins them in other ways, too.
Oiie woman has named, her “my
friend of resource;’? and she is just
that. Anyone, students as well as
mature people, comes to her with
their problems, knowing that they
will be received with sympathy;
knowing, too, their trouble will
treated frankly and conﬁdentially.
Dr. Teagarden has a keen sense of
values; she treats each person as
an individual-—“picki'ng out the best
in a person and ignoringrthe other,”
'_ has said. It is this same
mocratic spirit Ajhlt endears her

ﬁgs: people she‘meets_
dsshé is loved for her devotion

It is apretty home with

part of each week-end with her-par-
entsin Washington.‘ _

For Dr. Teagarden is busy, as Pitt
people know. Clinic hours, classes,
activities and lectures. fill her time
to overﬂowing. She is known
throughout the state as an able psy-
chologist; and time and time a n
speaks before various ‘organizat ons.
Dr.’ Teagarden has a way of pre-
senting her lectures that is well
liked; coming straight to the point,
she states her ideas .clearly,_ be it
in class or at a meeting of nationally
known educators. _ She has the knack
of speaking convincingly that un-
consciously wins agreement. _

Her activities may be summarized
—-in alist thatsounds like a cata-
log. A graduate of Pitt with a
bachelor's and master’s degree, she
received her doctorate at Columbia.
She is a. member of Pi Lambda
Theta and Kappa Delta Pi, national
honorary educational fraternities, a
‘Fellow of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science, and
a member of the American Psycho-
logical Association, the American
Association of University Women,
and the American Association of
University Professors.

Small as the work may be in com-
parison with her national recogni-
tion, Dr. Teagarden really enjoys
giving her service on the campus.

W. S. G. A. commission meeting
couldn’t get along without her help,
it seems; and the girls appreciate
her work.

Yet, busy as she is, Dr. Tea arden ,

never ﬁnds the time too short or the
little things. Although the weather
was almost too warm last week, she
came to the W. S. G. A. conference
banquet. It made ,.us feel good to
have her tell the girls that the dinner
they had prepared and served them-

be selves was “perfect.”

it is in this light that we like to
think of her best, eager to help with
sympa y and understanding, always
ready enjoy a joke--or tell one,
too——and living the big things and
the smallest details of life. We like

Cathedral of Learning foundations , s
are being prepared for the erection, ‘ ‘i ,,;'§,3
of the first steel girders expectedto - a 
arrive on the lot next Monday‘ after" ,V
a two week’s delay in fabrication.
Workmen are cementing the few re. 
maining column. bases into position. , 
on the caissons and with the placing ' ‘
of the drillages in the wall niches for  
cross-beam anchors, steel is expected   ” 
to rise without further delay once ,
its delivery has been made. ’ ; . . .

Steel girders have already been, .
fabricated and are being stored at
the freight yard until the floor  ..
beams have been completed. Accord-,- ‘' ;
ing to Fred L. Crabtree, ﬁeld engi-A_ .’
neer for Stone and Webster, Cathe-  I
dral contractors, it is impossible to-
raise the girders until the cross ,
beams are at hand to knit the steel‘ ‘
superstructure into a self supporting ’ _
mass. . 5 

Provide for Theatre Workshops ‘ '

Tentative plans are being com-
pleted for the little theater which
will be located in the lower floors of
the new structure. It is planned to
have fully equipped workshops
where all necessary equipment for
stage productions can be completed  D
by students interested in this phase» I 
of work. Back of the stage will be
located a row of dressing rooms with
ample privacy assuredﬂfor men and o
women actors. The plans also in-
clude several large rooms which will
be equipped for scenery, 'nting
and construction as well as acilitiei
for experimental work.  

Plans Include Rehearsal Room ‘ ;

Cathedral plans also include _;a
practice room for rehearsals con-
ducted by glee clubs, bands, orches-
tras, and other organizations of this
nature. The room will be a dupli-
cate of the little theater in size and
construction and will have a stage
platform large enough for any or-
ganizations which may use it. The
floor will be of hardwood to provide
for dancing. The practice room will
be located under the commons roc_m

be two stories in height. D .2-

’ A memorial to the late Chancellor
Emeritus-‘ —S. B. McCormick was
adopted by the alumni council, ex-
eegtive body of the alumni associa-
 ’at its monthly" meeting ‘at
Faculty Club, Monday evening. The
resolution --is to be written into the
minutes of the council and read at
the University memorial service Fri-
day. A co will be sent to Mrs. Mc-
Cprinick. _ e resolution was framed
by»a‘co,inniittee consisting of Benja-
min Thaw, Col.‘-” ’78,'_,? chairman;
Joseph C. Trees, Eng.’ ’95; Charles

D. Wet-tac Law, '97‘, and Kenneth

fIj;“.‘l1l‘6$.d’i' profesiiionali background
which never lost its value. But
‘higher education was his hobby and
his forte‘, and it‘ was inevitable that
he should assume the. residency of
‘a college, and in the fu lness of time
_returi_1 to Pittsburgh to head an ob-
‘scare ‘institution whose future few
but himself could see. ;He never
sought.‘ an easy ost, and hsthrew
himself into the ormidabletask with

all the splendid virility of his prime.

“The story of his administration
has been often repeated, and long
will be. Like Augustus Caesar, and
quite as. literally, he found Rome
brick and left it marble. The ideals;
of unity for an amorphous handful
of schools and courses,‘ and of iden-
tity of the University's interests.
with those of the community is
served were never absent from his
mind and si ht. The University has
advanced noily under his successor.
Dr McCormick foresaw-‘ its progress
and applauded it with all his gener-
rus Leart. It will go on to a great-
ness ye: undreamed of. But what-
ever of high excellence it attains will
rest ultimately on the sure founda-
tions of Dr. McCormick_’.s toil.
~ .“The human qualities that lay
back of. this memorable V achievement
are not always apparent on the sur-
face, and it is to these . illars of his
character that we shal turn back
with the years, grateful that such a
man, in the providence of God, was
matched with the hour and place he
ﬁlled. Who that knew him as a
friend will ever forget his deep sin-
cerity, his intense industry. His valor
and persistence against '.in’credible
odds, his robust optimism, his con-
stant and self-giving power? «Who
does‘ not feel the warmer -at-the
thought of his l-iindliness, his de-
mocracy, his tolerance, 3 and his

enial humor? This capacity" for
riendship, this outstretched help-
ing hand will remain in our memo-
ries for life. ’ "

“The General Alumni Association
of the University of Pittsburgh,.to
which he was always amstrongg sup-
port, in paying this last tribute to’
Dr. McCormick, wishes also to ex-'
press its deep sympathy and,admira-
tion for the wife who shared so
graciously her husband's labors and
his personal inﬂuence. They have
built their enduring monument in
the lives of thousands of students
who passed through our Alma Mater
under their ministry."

' One of the most interesting per-

_Crabt1‘e.e‘, ﬁeld engineer for Stone

«He still evades questions concern-
ing his‘ escape from injury when two
sticks of dynamite. which he struck
with a pick in the bottom of a forty-
foot caisson hole failed to explode.
He tells interesting tales of the days
of work he has spent in, with, and
about, dynamite. ....In-.the. west sev-
eral year ago he helped blast twin
tunnel bores through the side of;a
mountain. The bore wasonly high
enough to allow him to stand up and
before each small blast it was neces-
sary to retreat about forty feet to
escape the fumes and debris set ﬂy-
ing with each ex losion. In spite of
the danger invo ved in such opera-
tions he has escaped injury. . Once,
while standing» near the_ entrance ~01’:
the bore, a blast went off inside and
the, force of the outrushing air was
great enough to knock over a work-

trance. Yet such- air rushings. do
not seem to affect Crabtree. Down
in the Cathedral foundations the
fumes given off with the explosions
seem nauseatin to ‘many workmen.

In - Group ' A-

Conipeting against a ﬁeld of
thirty-four high schools, Peabody
high school of Pittsburgh won ﬁrst
honors in group A of thetenth an-
nual interscholastic contest spon-
sored by the University on April 28.
Ben Avon -high school took ﬁrst
award in the group B contest, con-
sisting.of schools whose last three
grades comprise not more than 300
pupils." Results were announced Fri-
day by Dr..Davi'<i P. Harry, assist-

 

kant professor of educational admin-
“istratioii, who was

, in charge of
grading the,test and ‘tabulating the
rtsults. '. '

The "contestants 7. showed remark-
able ability‘ in answering the 631
questions on ~Engl-ish, mathematics,
natural science and social studies,
D_r. Harry states. In view of the
fact thatthe examinations this year
were made‘ much more difficult by
the addition of~a comprehensive test,

tively low. “However, the satisfac-
tory way invwhich some of the stu-
dents handled the tests is really re-
markable,” Dr. Harry declared.
. _.’I‘he establishment of the compre-
hensive test was as part of the con-
teat\‘exam_ination,’ made by Dr.. Harry,
required thorough preparation on the
part of 2 the pupil in all the .basic
code subjects of the high “school cur-
riculum. Where, in former years, the
student who specialized‘ in only one
subject could be successful in the
contest, this year‘ the academically
versatile student was favored, Dr.
Harry stated. -
The other schools in group A,
whose teams scored iabove average,
in order of - position won, are Dor-
mpnt xHi h,’ Mc_Keesport and Wil-
kinsburg, gh schools (tied for third
p{lace),‘V Homestead, Greensburg, New

until 1904. During his administration
at Coe College it grew from little
more than a hi h school into one of
the leading co eges In Iowa.
In 1904 he accepted the call to
become Chancellor of the Western
University of Pennsylvania. At that
time the University was remotely
situated, on Perrysville Avenue; its
total enrollment was $19. Immedi-
ately after coming to Pittsburgh, Dr.
McCormick set out to interest both
the public and the commonwealth in
the work of the University. He suc-
ceeded in securing an appropriation
of $175,000 for erection of a new
building. After considerable time
spent in considering sites, the pres-
ent location was chosen and construc-
tion proceeded rapidly.

Organizes Athletic Department

A number of additions to the
building, departments and faculty of
the University were effected through
the efforts of Dr. McCormick. He
instituted a summer session, and or-
ganized the athletic department.
pon the recommendation of Dr.
McCormick, Mellon Institute was es-
tablished at Pitt. Through his wide
acquaintanceships, Dr. McCormick
was able to greatly increase the
ﬁnancial resources, and to secure
recognition of the University as one
of the important institutions of the
country. .

Helps Increase Body to 6000
At the close of Dr. McCormick’s
administration in 1920, the Univer-
sity consisted of all the schools now
at Pitt and had an enrollment of
over 6,000 students and a faculty of
approximately 500.
Dr. McCormick was a life mem-
ber of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science, a mem-
ber of the American Academy of
Political and Social Science, the His-
torical, Society of Western Pennsyl-

New York, the Victoria Institute,
Sons of the American Revolution, a
director of the Carnegie Foundation
forthe Advancement of Teaching, a
director for ‘many years of the West-
ern Theological Seminary, and for a
number of years one of the electors
of the Hall of Fame of . New York
University. He was also a member
of Phi Gamma Delta andomicron
Delta Kappa fraternities.

Link Of

Speaks To Psychology
ovum

Dr.

“The application of the technique
of behaviorism has accomplished a
great deal in industry” believes Dr.
H. C. Link, psychologist of the ex-
ecutive department of Gimbel Broth-
ers, who addressed the psychology
forum on the “Practicality of Be-
haviorism” Monday afternoon in 315
Alumni Hall. Dr. Link graduated
from Yale in 1916. Since that time
he has worked in industries that
have application to phychology. At
the same time he has been on the
faculty of Columbia, Harvard and
Yale. He is now working in the ex-
ecutive office of Gimbel Brothers.

Dr. Link, although classiﬁed as a
behaviorist, a psychologist who dis- ,
counts the mind in explaining human
behavior, is not greatly interested in
the warfare going on between the
behaviorist and introspectionist or
subjective schools of psychology. His
attitude toward behaviorism is typi-
ﬁed in his statementthat “Behavior-
ism is a technique and not a philos-
ophy.” .

In the retail field, Dr. Link has
found opportunities for a very ex-
tensive application of the technique
of behaviorism. Employers have al-
ready made a great deal of prog-
ress in that ﬁeld. They have work-
ed in a scientiﬁc method, -although
little interested in theory.

The most notable advances have
been made along the line of deter-

for the second of a series of dis-

Kind Of College It Should

“A college should be an institu-

spiritual faculties largely by letting
the student employ his own efforts,”

So to. College.” '

Dean Sieg, in opening his talk,

made up‘ their mind to attend col-
lege. Before making up his mind
as to what college the student should
attend, die should determine what he
intends doing, what t e of school
he is best i‘itted«for-—-a ar e univer-
sity- or a small college, a enomina-
tional school, an independent one or
a co-educational college, he said.

fter' mak

tend, the prospective student should
send for the official college bulletins.
After carefully stud ing these, he
should be able to se act with some
degree of success the proper school
to attend.

A college should» not, Dean Sieg
asserted, stuff its students’ minds
with vast quantities of information.
" Continuing, Dean Sieg said,
“There is a big difference on the
one hand between holding the stu-
dent responsible for the ability to
repeat portions of lectures in his ex-
aminations, and on the other stimu-
lating him to form for himself,

That Examinations Were ‘a
“Good Things”

Approximately 600 seniors took
the college achievement’ tests’ given
Monday and Tuesday under the
supervision of the Carnegie Founda-
tion for the advancement of teach-
ing. Those who took the examina-
tions were excused from all classes
during the period of examination.
The same tests were given to every
college and similarlones to all*the"
secondary schools throughout Penn-
sylvania. , . p ,. 

On Monday the ﬁrst session of
examinations took up questions of a
physical, nature. Under this group
questions of natural science, toolsof’
scientific investigation, analytic

sciences, earth sciences, and the

sciences of life wereconsidered.
Social .World Considered

The second session included the A

social world. Tools of scientiﬁc in-
vestigation, taking ire six languages:
Greek, Latin, French, German, Span-

ish and Italian, as apart-‘of this V

session. _ Ancient cultures dealing
with primitive, near east, Greek,

constituted l the questions in‘ this
ﬁeld. Tuesday morning the tests con.-_,

A riod, was covered in this“ session.
The ﬁnal sessions concluded. «the: ~

questions on western,civilization.;At

Seniors Express Opinions .

It ‘was the general opinion among
the seniors that the exarnin_ations
were “fair” and a “good thing.” It
proved a. means of checkinggup“ on
oneself; as expressed by many
seniors, not in ﬁnding out howmuch‘

‘ but how little theyknow. It was a.

popular belief thatif graduation de-
pended on the outcome of theytests.
all those taking the exams would not
receive-their diplomas. ‘ .-

_On one point there was a? great-
difference of opinion. Many! felt
that the questions were highly=.p‘ra'c-.«_
tical, while just as many_held the-‘
exams to be technical. Some opined‘
that the questions ran from one ex-i
treme to the other, that is," the_'ques'-’
tions were either difficult "or-‘ex
tremely easy. . . ’ A

Some; of the seniors..believed that
although _the exams were in them-
selves f_a1r,_ it was unfair to .,hold
them this time of the year, because
of the many papers which are due
and because of the extrawork re-
quired for graduation.

dents must contribute. and the fact
that a large majority of students
disapprove of the actions of the gov-
ernment and withdraw their sup-
port. The only solution is to create
a demand for a W. S. G. A. and to
satisfy the demand. Each college
presented its ownlmethod of ﬁnan-
cing its student government but Pitt
is the only school which presented. a
complete budget plan or all commit-
tees and activities that come under
W. S. G. A. _

Faculty lectures, dormitory rules,
examinations on rules and traditions,
big and little sister weeks, co-ed
proms, senior mentors, tea dances,
and various hazing regulations, cere-
moniesare used at various schools
to help in the orientation of Fresh-
men were brought out in the group
led by Allegheny College with
Jeanne King, ’29, as group
hostess.

Most of these activities are man-

aged by the Y. W. C. A. The sug-
gestion was made that since all;
women are automatically members;
of W. S. G. A. the orientation of :
freshmen women should be under its 5:
management.

hostess conducted the discussion of

playing the best teams of the East.
Last Saturday they overwhelmed
the.-Colgate’ team by a score of 8 to

* Penn To Be Tough
The Penn team is composed of a

will not be quite as ‘great as that
of the Penn team. Fr1day"they-play‘
at‘Georgetown and Saturday they
go to Annapo is where they meet
the Middies. The Sailors are bound
to ‘give the Panthers as good oppo-
sition as they will encounter on the
trip. They are not-undefeated, hav-
ing. fallen before Princeton -,by" a
huge score early in the season, but
have been doing better lately and
will cause the Panthers a lot of
worry. The Navy has some forty odd
courts and compels every man in
the‘ school to try out for the team.-
The ﬁnal six men are selected from
the hundreds of candidates. The Mid-
dies playvtennis all ‘year around. In
the winter they play on indoor
courts. 3-N‘ayy overwhelmed the Pan-

GRIDDDRILL CLOSES

Coach Sutherland Calls:--Quits
After Seven Weeks’- * 
Hard Work '

The decision of Coach Sutherland
to. close football practice yesterday.-
came as ‘the "sun in a shower; to the
griddists who havebeenxlrilling for
the past seven weeks.~ In thisﬁtirnef
the new material. has been weeded
out and a, first team has ﬁnally been

moulded ‘into a tentative ﬁgure.

With the injury of Captain Fox
last week, Coach Sutherland has re-
vamped the line of the ‘first team,-
Bleacing Milligan at center, Fox and

molio at guards, Getto and Mont-
gomery at tackle and .Donchess and

uarino still remainin at the ‘ter-
minals. The backﬁel ‘is’ still in-
tact. Charlie Edwards -at quarter,
Parkinson at full, and Uansa and
Boone at half. This team is only
tentative and with the beginnin of

fall training, September 9, at- amp A 
Hamilton, the old line will be back 5

in position.

The reserves made up of Walen-
chas, Loehr, Lewis, Milligan, L.L:An-
derson, R. Anderson, Faw, Corsonj,
Klinger, Dovers ike, Mahronic,
Schultz, Hood, Wi llams, Helsing,
Shaw, Weinstein,-. Goldbouég, Brue-
ckcn, Glenn, Todd, Baker. émo and‘
Kelly will be a fairly substantial
group to ‘fall back on. . ' .

Dr. Sutherland. .exp_res_s.es his opin-
ion that if the first team. comes‘
through without an accident and the‘
reserves aren’t called upon too much,
Pitt may have a. fairly successful.
season. The team has shown--up-;

better than he"e‘xpected at the be‘- .

inning of ‘the spring season, but
e does not believe that he has much .
to fall back on if the ﬁrst” team
should crack. »
Captain Fox says of the team, “We
aren’t the same squad we were last
year or anything like it, but we are
a ﬁghting squad that should come
through} a.Of coursewe-«won’t have
a ‘perfect 3‘1’ec0Id,'but_ at least Pitt
wll not be ashamed of her squad.”
/Charlie Edward‘ quarter, says,
“We have come "t rough training
better than I could-ever‘ hope. On
looking forward to next season, one
of. the toughest schedules in years,
I can only hope. There is one thing
certain, tin. team will do its-best.”
Dave Stewart, varsity football
manager, says, “This year the team
may not be so good, but next year,
look out! Practically the entire
squad will be with us next year, and
tlpt means another one of the fa-
mous Sutherland “ shes. For the

Steinder and Riley ﬁnished only
inches apart in one of the most
ﬁueling ﬁnishes witnessed in tl_Ie_A
