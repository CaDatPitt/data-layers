For Cathedral

in Fraternal Week

    
   
 

   

N oving Day

In order to make room for
the 500 soldiers who will move

‘into the Cathedral of Learn-

ing on March 1, Mr. John

V Weber, University, secretary,

announced Friday that there
will be complete room changes
involving rooms on floors from

. the third to the sixteenth.

Classes are not to be changed,

he added, until given official noti-

ﬁcation. The changes will include
some classrooms on the third and
fourth ﬂoors, the Dean of Men’s
and the Dean of Women’s offices,
offices of the Pitt News, Owl, and
YMCA, and, most probably, the
biology department. The various
libraries will not be affected in
the change.

’ Offices of the Dean of Men will

be located on the thirtieth ﬂoor of

the Cathedral.

The News and Owl will share an
office on the same ﬂoor. The Dean
of iWomen’s office may be located
on the thirtieth floor or, possibly,
on the ﬁrst ﬂoor.

Plans for these changes, Mr.

‘ Weber concluded, are as yet in

an incomplete stage. The chang-
es will not be made all at once,
but gradually until March 1. No
classes are to change until offi-
cially told to do so, as the mov-
ing plan will vary according to
the schedule blocks.

The U.S. troops will be quarter-
ed and will have classes on sev-

*eral ﬂoors. These classes will be
. separate fromthose of the regular

student body.

lnitiated Friday
Brotherhood Week, which will be
observed at the University Feb-

- ruary 19 to 26, will be initiated

Friday by the weekly Heinz chapel
service, with Louise Conover, C43,

_ - acting as student leader.

Religious activities committee,
headed by Theodore W. Biddle,
dean of men, will sponsor the
events to take place during the
week. Included in the program is
.Pitt town meeting next Wed-
nesday afternoon, which will fea-
ture Rabbi Charles Lesser, Fath-
er Owen Rice, and Dr. Marshall
‘Muir.

These clergymen will speak on
the special contribution their faith
could make towards the brother-
hood of men, according to Larry

, McBride, C45, chairman.

Sunday has been designated
Student Day of Prayer. Students

-of Pitt, Tech, and Pennsylvania

College for Women are invited to
attend a. special Heinz Chapel serv-

" ._ ice, followed by an informal tea in

A the social room of the Stephen Fos-
‘K ‘ter Memorial, when members of
"  Pitt YWC.A*will act as hostesses.

Special musical «programs have

.also been planned for the daily
, Commons Room teas.

R. Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear, Dean of

‘Pitt’s School of Business Admin-

istration, states that there is a

V _ deﬁnite place for women in busi-

ness.

. “Accountants are needed ——they
can be placed,” he said. “For exam-
ple, last spring the Price Water-

. house and Company took a consid-

ferable number of women account-

 7} pants. It found them very satisfac-
, jﬁitory. Some of the women, it was
, said, have done remarkably well

and have already made a place for

_ themselves.”

“Another professional" barrier

“against women has fallen,” Dean
flganfear _contin_ued. ff_F_‘~irms were

Air Navigation
Courses Added

Teaching of navigation at the
University has been expanded to
include two special classes in prac-
tical air navigation. They are to
be given in reply to a request from
the 7 Ohio Valley Flying Clubs.
Many of the members, all of whom
are employees of the Curtiss
Wright _Corporation’s plant in
Beaver, already hold private pilots’
licenses.

Navigation courses for high
school teachers also will be added.
Because of many requests for a
repetition of similar course given
last year a beginning class will
start Saturday, February 20.

Registration for these courses
will begin this week. All members
of the teaching staff hold Civil
Aeronautics Authority licenses as
navigation instructors. A

hesitant about employing women
accountants because their work re-
quired that they be sent out of town.
Working at top speed over long
hours while taking inventories
seemed too much to ask women to
do. But with total war it is a dif-
ferent story. And now, since the
girl accountants have done so well,
it is to be expected they will con-
tinue in this work after the emer-
gency makes it no longer neces-
sary.”
There are many new courses
in Business Administration which
' will aid the war etort. These
new’ condensed courses have been
designed for men and women-in

 

Fraternity rushing “week”
starts on its three day course
tomorrow night. The official
rushing period will last from
8:30 o’clock on Wednesday
night until two hours after
midnight on Friday night.

All the fraternities are joining
together to sponsor one mixed eve-
ning affair which is scheduled for
Friday night. Individually, the fra-
ternities will hold their own
theatre parties, bowling parties,
and parents’ nights.

A time limit has been determin-
ed for each evening. It is set at
10:30 o’clock for Wednesday eve-
ning, 1:00 o’clock for Thursday,
and 2:00 for the ﬁnal evening.

Silence week will then start im-
mediately following the early Sat-
urday morning curfew. Fraternity
men will not be allowed to con-
tact any of the pledges until the
formal pledging period begins at
5:00 o’clock on Thursday, Febru-
ary 25.

Panhellenic Council at Pitt will
sponsor its annual education meet-

ing on Women’s rushing for those
who transferred here last Septem-
ber and all September freshman
Women tomorrow at 1 :30 o'clock in
the social room of Foster Memorial.

This annual meeting is designed
to acquaint women with formal
rushing, bidding, and acceptance
procedure at the University. All
girls in attendance will receive
their copies of “Who's Who in
Women’s Fraternities,” the official
Panhellenic handbook for new stu-
dents. ,

Seretta Miller, Ed44, chairman
of the freshman education com-
mittee will preside. Helen Pool
Rush, dean of women, and Alice
Conick, Panhellenic president, will
speak.

All women who wish to receive
rushing invitations must present a
copy of their blueprint of last
semester. Eligibility will be checked
by the office of dean of women.
Blueprints may be presented this
afternoon and tomorrow in 1209
Cathedral. Upper class women in-
terested in rushing may also at-
tend the meeting and present blue-
prints.

Cleven lnvites Students

To Spansh Art Display

Professor of History, Dr. N. An-
drew N. Cleven, who is also official
Pittsburgh consul for the Bolivian
Republic, invites all members of the
student body, the faculties, and the
administration who are interested
in the culture of Spanish South
America to an exhibit now showing
in the auditorium of Boggs and
Buhl Co. on the North Side.

Dr. Cleven says, “The collector,
Mrs. Ruth E. Sweeney, a connois-
seur in art, has brought together
the finest collection of its kind in
the world. There are rare, priceless
objects, illustrating the best in the
workmanship of the Inca Empire.
of the colonial period, and of the
period of independence up to the
present time. The exhibition is
most timely, and is a very laudable
gesture toward good neighborli-
ness.”

Twelve courses are on the spe-

With them are other related

Shaughnessy  
Well Received

Pitt gave its new football coach,
Clark Shaughnessy, an enthusiastic
welcome on Friday at the special
assembly in Foster Memorial. The
rally was featured by speeches by
Abe Bluestone, newly elected chair-
man of the Emergency Student
Government Committee; Chester L.
Smith, sports editor of The Pitts-
burgh Press; Vice Chancellor Ru-
fus H. Fitzgerald, and Mr. Shaugh-
nessy himself.

7 Mr. Bluestone promised the
new coach the support of the en-
tire student body, win, lose, or
draw. The students endorsed his
sentiments with loud applause
and cheers.

Chet Smith, speaking as a meni-
ber of “the downtown coaches as-
sociation,” promised Shaughnessy
the aid and cooperation of his as-
sociation anytime Shaughnessy
feels he needs any advice on how
to run his team or whom to use in
his backﬁeld, or information on the
ﬁner points of the T formation.

The students rose automatically
when the new coach got up to
speak.

Shaughnessy devoted his talk to
thanking the students for the wel-
come, giving his reason for com-
ing to Pitt, and assigning the place
of football in the present crisis.

'1'intes’ Sunday editorial. It -is not an analysis of any of these.)
In Time magazine there is a reprint cartoon

, I by" Artist “Ding.” It is in two panels. The ﬁrst

panel shows Hunter Stalin coming down the
street, with a riﬂe in one hand and in the

S other a dead rabbit representing conquered

Germany. In a doorway stand Roosevelt,

‘ ~ VWallace and Welles, dressed in chef’s aprons
 .},and saying, alternately, “Oh, goodie, we’ll

~ A make a stew,” “And we’ll invite everyone
;over,’’ and, “Then everyone “can have some

of the stew.” _»
The second panel, evidently, occurs Ten

Seconds Later. It shows Stalin still walking,
‘by now past the doorway where stands the
‘ﬂustered trio. Stalin is saying, “I like mine
_-fried.”

No treatise on international dietetics,
‘fD1ng’s” cartoon represents one of the two ex-

‘ treme viewpoints about Russia. “Ding’s” atti-

tude, like that of the German press, holds

_ ‘that Russian victory in this war means that
Bolshevism will spread over the continent,

possibly the world.
‘ The other extreme holds that Russia is
merely defending itself, that the Soviet will
have no claims to make in the writing of the
peace treaty.

Somewhere between the two extremes lies

"truth. This war is more than a war between

Fascism and Communism. At the ‘same time,
quietgJoe Stalin IS cocking more- than a casu-

'al eye at the Roosevelt-Churchill conferences.

In this country, before the war, there
ﬂourished an isolationist-minded set of peo-
ple who ﬁgured that we could stand by,

1 watch the Russians and Germans knock each

other silly, then step in over their panting
bodies and re-arrange the order of the World.

The only trouble is that the same group
still ﬂourishes. They still preach that we
should stall as long as possible, letting the
dead pile up on the banks of the Russian

rivers. They say that if the Russians win too

soon we will be forced to conform to a Rus-

I H‘ Aksian-dictated peace, and that then the ten-

tacles of collectivism will spread over Europe,
into Asia, and thence to the Americas.

On the other hand, the visionaries and
idealists of this country insist that Russia
will have no claims to make, that the Man of
Steel will be content to return to his original
borders and continue the internal growth of
his country. The idealists, while not so vi-
cious as the isolationists, are just as wrong.

Stalin will want something. He will want a
warm-water port. He may want access to an
Indian,’a Balkan or a Chinese port. At any
rate, it will be a big job to convince him that
an industria1—agricultural giant such as Rus-
sia should be land-locked during the cold
months.

As for the spread of Communism, how-
ever, in the Old World or the New, it just
won’t happen. More likely is the possibility
that England and Russia, as the two great
forces of the Old World," will approach a
level. That is, England will become more lib-
eral and Russia more conservative, until
there is no telling them apart.

Both are on the way. In the matter of re-
form, England has been about a generation
ahead of us. She had such institutions as old
age beneﬁts, unemployment compensation
and minimum-_wage laws long before our leg-
islatures ever heard of them.

Russia, on theother hand, is getting over
its ﬁrst wild ﬂing at radicalism. Worker—in-
centives have .become material and ﬁnancial,
as well as spiritual and nationalistic. The
Stakhanovites are paid on what amounts to
a piece-work basis, something that the great
bulk of American labor would never tolerate.

These are the speculations: that Russia
must be considered as a potent factorin any
plans for post-war reconstruction; that the
spread of Communism, as such, out of its
present boundaries is not likely; and that
England and Russia will some day reach a
level of liberalism.

Those are the speculations. To know what
the actual peace and reconstruction will be
like, We shall have to wait and see.

Ed. Note: This is John Sher)-
pard’s farewell column before leav-
ing for the army.

It_ seems there are two types of
girls at our University—those who
attach themselves to one frat
house, i.e., Lorna Hazelton and the
PiKA’s—-and those who play the
ﬁeld, skillfully or unskillfully, as
the case may be.

Peggy Fixel is an obvious ex-
ample of the second group. How-
ever, Gini Volkay can’t decide
which philosophy she wishes to
follow——having several times
dated Delt Bill Wiley and also
others from Carnegie Tech. Now
she suddenly ﬁnds herself not
only involved but surrounded by
Phi Gams.

Jack McCandliss gave her his
pin and his ring, Bill Yocum pre-
sented her with his suit—coat
Thursday evening when she com-
plained of being cold, and Bill
Newstetter manages to keep both
Gini and Dorty Franklin quite
busy.

He is now trying to decide
which one to concentrate on. Be-
sides this, he is still trying to
date Dotty Davidson and even
threatens to cut in on Vincent
Joyce and Sam Frazier in the
Winnie Jarvis League. It’s too
bad such a heartbreaker has to
leave for the army soon, espe-
cially since men are becoming so
scarce. .

Howard Masquelier’s troubles
with blondes seems to have been in-
herited by Bill Clemmer. Dona Kin-

Shaughnessy . . .

continued from page 1

“Pittsburgh has always been’ a '
town noted for its courage and I
strength,” he declared. “The U ni-
versity has the same character-
istics and ideals that the city
has. The pioneers who built a
city like this and a Cathedral
like this can’t lose the war.”

Shaughnessy concluded by invit-
ing all the boys to come out for
football, whether they had previous
high school experience or not. 4

After the rally the members of
the committee and speakers had
luncheon together, although it was

cut short by the fact that~the coach"

had to make a 3 o’clock plane.

dle is the common denominator,
having been the middle blonde in

each case. In Bil1’s case No. 1 blonde A

seems to be Theta Margie Linn and

No. 3 is Kay Lowery from Wilson ’

College. This latter Wilson number
is the one that Bill tried to keep a
secret and it worked out so well
that now he tries to keep all three
in the dark as long as possible. ~.

After spending most of three
semesters investigating the femi-
nine ﬁeld, Bob Verklin seems to
have arrived at a decision. It’s
quite a compliment to Nell Lauth
to have emerged victorious over
such campus beauties as June
Thompson, Betty Adams, and Jean
Goushe. ’

Incidentally the fastest mov-
ing dateline on record seems to
be Jean Goushe’s. Howard Scott
and C. J. Donahue have given
way to Rolly Merchant, Milt An-1
tonoplos, and Bob Miller.

' Pitt, it will be remembered, won
the ﬁrst ‘game, 44-38. But since
that game, Tech has come back to
defeat a previously unbeaten Alle-
gheny outﬁt, and to take over the
same Westminster that beat Pitt.
‘ last week-end.
, The Panthers, too, haven’t been.
doing too badly since the ﬁrst Tech
iencounter, but of late they haven’t
been ﬂashing anything which
Vmight be called championship form.

pl

      

They beat Penn State, and they
took two from Geneva rather hand-
ily,~‘and then blitzed Indiana State
Teachers, but after that ran into a
bit of trouble. First they lost that
ludicrous -Westminster game at
New Wilmington, and then they

traveled to West Point to eke out
a one-point victory over the Cadets.

In that game, the Panthers just
couldn’t get going, and the fact
that the Army boys played their
best game of the season didn’t help.
Expecting a comparatively easy
game, the largest advantage they
could boast at any time was ﬁve
points. A ﬁeld goal in the last
twenty-ﬁve seconds by Malarkey
ﬁnally settled the issue. 2

Going into this game, the two
teams had exactly opposite records
-—Pitt with 8 wins and two losses,
Army with 2 and eight. And for

First of all, is the WAAC really needed?

Emphatically yes.’ Already the President has authorized the

Corps to expand from 25,000 to 150,000. The Air Iﬁorces

and Signal Corps have asked for thousands of WAAC mem-

bers ‘to help with vital duties. Both Ground Forces and

Services of Supply are asking for thousands more. Members '
of the WAAC may be assigned to duty with the Army any-'

where - some are already in Africa and England.

IVhat can my college education contribute?

College training is important equipment for many WAAC
"""‘§ duties too long to list. Cryptography, drafting, meteorology,
laboratory work, Link trainer and glider instructing, for ex-
, ample. If you are a senior you may enroll at once and be
t V E, ;/ placed on inactive duty until the school yeah ends. See your

  

Can the WAAC really help win the war?

The whole idea‘ of the WAAC is to replace trained soldiers
needed at the front. If American women pitch in now to help ‘
our Army (as women in Britain, Russia and China do), we

Victory —- and peace.

WAAC fgtculty advise; for mgrg details.

But can I live comfortably on WAAC pay!’

There are few civilian jobs in which you could earn clear
income, as WAAC enrolled members do, of $50 to $138 a
month —- with all equipment from your toothbrush to cloth-
ing, food, quarters, medical and dental care provided. WAAC
oﬂicers earn from,.$l50 to $333.33 a month.

   

    

many a moment during the play,
it looked as if the Cadets were go-

ing to improve their record at the
expense of a supposedly superior

Pitt team.

Observers have noted that the
Panthers are at their best when
playing a tough foe, and really be-
gin to click when the other team
on the ﬂoor is as good as or better
than they are. But when they play
a team which truly could be called
inferior, they seem to lose their
spark.

In proof of this, they point out
the Army and Indiana games. In
the latter, the Panthers met a team

which didn’t belong on the same ~
ﬂoor with them, yet they led by -

only 7 points at the intermission.
True, they ﬁnally won the game by
some 24 points, but that was after
a last-half spurt. We are not pre-
pared to judge this observation,

Some questions and answers of interest

to every, patriotic college woman

The drilling sounds so etrenuous—!

Nonsense! The most beautiful women in America today
are the girls in khaki! Some calisthenics and drilling are
vital to general good health, discipline and tuned-up reﬂexes.
After a few weeks at Fort Des Moines, Daytona Beach or the
new Fort Oglethorpe’ training center y_ou’ll feel better than

‘ever in your life.

Maybe I wouldn’t like the work?

People are happiest doing what they do well. Every effort
-is made to place you where your service will count most
toward ﬁnal Victory. You may have some latent talent that
will ﬁll a particular need for work interesting and new to
women——such as repairing the famous secret bombsight,
rigging parachutes, operating the fascinating new electronic
devices-- or driving an Army jeep over foreign terrain.

Then I have a chance to learn something new?

Yes, indeed. And the list of WAAC duties grows constantly.

The training and experience you

get in the WAAC may

equip you for many stimulating new careers opening up

for women.

IVhat are my chances of promotion?

Excellent. The Corps is expanding rapidly and needs new
ofﬁcers, both commissioned and noncommissioned. Those
who join now have the best chances. All new olﬁcers now
come up through the ranks. If qualiﬁed, you may obtain a
commission in 12 weeks after beginning basic training.

What is the age range and other requirements?

Very simple. You may join if you are a U. S. citizen, aged
21 to 44-, inclusive, at least 5 feet tall and not over 6 feet,
in good health —- regardless of race, color or creed. But the
Army needs you now—-don’t delay. Total War won’t wait!

Linguists needed. If you speak and write Spanish,
Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, French, German
or Italian, see your local Army recruiting oﬂice now! You
are needed for interpreting, cryptography, communications.

nesday evening, February 10, at
Troy, New York on ‘Thursday
evening, February 11, and at Col-
gate University in Hamilton, New
York, on Saturday evening, Feb-
ruary 13. The entire orchestra of
90 musicians will be taken on the
trip. In view of the transportation
diﬁiculties, it will be necessary to
travel by day coach throughout the
yvhole period.

Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear,
Dean of the School of Busi-
ness Administration, has been
named director of region three
of the commission on wartime
placement of college faculties
of the Association of Ameri-

can Colleges. Region three is

comprised of Pennsylvania and
Delaware.

In-it are ﬁfty-one colleges be-
longing to the association, plus
non-member colleges which may
also participate.

Vice-chancellor Rufus H. Fitz-
gerald is one of the four mem-
bers of the commission of which
Dr. Harold W. Dodds, president
of Princeton University is chair-
man.

The commission on wartime
placement is a national organiza-
tion to assist faculty men and
women in ﬁnding new employment.
Headquarters in New York is com-
piling a country-wide roster of
teachers whose status has been
changed because of the war. Some
in non-essential ﬁelds are qualiﬁed
to teach in vital ones in which
there are shortages.
