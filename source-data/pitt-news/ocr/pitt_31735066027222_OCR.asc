Prison escapee caught

Fugitives strange behavior in Texas
bus station leads to his apprehension

 

He ran, tunnelled, drove, and even took
a bus, but in the end, Thomas Berkelbaugh
couldn’t hide.

Berkelbaugh, one of the six inmates
who escaped from the State Correctional
Institution at Pittsburgh, was caught in a
Houston, Texas, bus station, Pennsylvania
State Police sources said.

State Trooper Terry Hunt, the public
relations oﬁicer at the state police’s Findlay
barracks, said that at approximately 1:52
am. Central Trrne, security guards at the
Greyhound bus station noticed an individ-
ual “wandering and acting strange.”

That person was Berkelbaugh.

Security guards took Berkelbaugh into
custody and contacted the Harris County
Sheriﬂ°’s department. When they arrived
they escorted Berkelbaugh to Bentaub
Hospital near downtown Houston for
observation.

It was there Berkelbaugh’s dreams of
freedom were shattered.

Hospital oﬂicials contacted one of

 

 

Berkelbaugh’s family members. Once his
identity was discovered, Hanis County
sheritfs contacted the Pennsylvania State
Police.

Hunt said state police officials were en
route to Houston yesterday to begin extra-
dition procedures and take Berkelbaugh
into custody.

A car, which the six escapees stole to
make their getaway from Pittsburgh, was
found in downtown Dayton, Ohio, on
Monday.

The car bore a license plate stolen from
a car in Fairbom, Ohio, several miles east of
Dayton.

Hunt wouldn’t corntnent on any leads
the state police have on the other ﬁve indi-
viduals, but he did speculate they have split
up.

“We’re investigating all possible
avenues,” said Hunt.

But the state police are not the only
ones searching for information.

Pennsylvania Department of Corrections,

Senator discusses young Republicans,
dreams, and international law

The following is the transcript of an
interview Senior Stqﬁ" Writer Russ Krebs
had, with former Pitt graduate and US.
Senator Rick Santorum (R-Pa. ), on the way
to speak to a group of high school students.

Pitt News: Why do you feel that youth are
so important?

Santonrm: Well, for a couple of reasons.
Numberone,Ithinktheyarebyar1dlargea
disillusioned group. They see government
as not really concerned about them. We
don’t spend our money on them We don’t
spend our money on researching the future.
We don’t have programs in Washington that
look like they will be viable much past the
next generation or two, which means
they’re paying a lot of money for nothing.

At least, that’s what a lot of them believe.
They’re more pessimistic about their eco-
nornic opportunities, not just in this region,
but all over the country. One ofthe things I
wantedthemtodowasletthemknowthat
things aren’t as bad as they seem, and they
have an opportunity to atfect that through
their participation as citizens. I think that’s
an important message for them to hear.

more active in the process. Not just the
political process or what’s going on in
Washington —— although I think that’s
important, and I’m going to talk about that

Brenda Johnson greets a student entering Lothrop Hall with a smile and a warm ”he|lo.”

As Pitt students come in from the
cold, rubbing their hands together to
regain some warmth, they are greeted
with the words, “Welcome back, love. My
isn’t it cold out there today? This is good
old-fashioned Pittsburgh weather!”

Brenda Johnson, a Pitt security offi-
cer, greets students as they shuffle in and
out of Lothrop Hall. As one girl passes by
without her coat buttoned, Johnson cries
out, “Girl, you had better button that coat
or you are going to get sick. It is freezing
out there.”

Johnson is different from any securi-
ty officer that most students will ever
meet. She can just sit and read a magazine
or play a video game as students walk
past and swipe their card into the slot, but
instead she chooses to inquire into the
lives of what she calls “her residents.” As
students gather in the lobby of Lothrop to
run to their destinations, Johnson strikes
up conversations about things from herbal
tea to research papers to good cold reme-
dies.

“I love my job. I take great pride in
my work, and I take great pride in my res-
idents. They are all my children,” Johnson
says with a radiant smile and a soft chuck-
le. “Yes, it’s like a family up here.”

Johnson became a member of the

 

Pinkerton—Pitt team two years ago and has
worked at all Pitt residence halls, but her
regular post is at Lothrop.

“Lothrop is my pet,” Johnson says.
“Other officers used to tell me not to go to
Lothrop because there was just too many
kids from all over, but I love it here.”

Johnson has held various jobs
throughout her life. She has worked as a
nurse’s aide, as a dietary assistant at
Children’s Hospital, as a housekeeper,
and as an employee of the IRS. Before
coming to Pitt, she was considering a
position at the Shadyside Rehabilitation
Home, but she wanted a change from
health services and applied for a security
position.

“I thought they would never hire an
old lady like me,” Johnson says with a
knowing look. “But I told them that I
wouldn’t let them down, and I got the job
the next day.”

When asked what keeps her interest-
ed, Johnson immediately replies that it is
the students. She is always talking with
her residents, asking how things are
going, and the students seem receptive of
her concern and enthusiasm. She says she
tries to treat her residents like adults while
at the same time providing them with a lit-
tle bit of motherly love.

Students smile, and oddly enough,
listen when “Miss B,” as Johnson is affec-

tionately known, reminds them to button
their coats, put on hats, and get enough
rest. Johnson refers to her relationship
with her students as an unbreakable bond.

“We have an understanding up here,”
Johnson emphatically says. “I tell them
I’m here to protect them and help them
out as much as I can, and I ask them to
respect me, and in return I’ll respect them
for the adults that they are.”

Students seem to appreciate the
respect they are given, but many students
enjoy the constant smiles and endless
words of support g
and encourage-
ment.

“I always think
I just
always smile — it
doesn’t take much.
Smiling will take
you a long way.
Kindness and
cheerfulness are the
best things in the
world, and I try to
pass that along,”

Johnson also has had much experience in
dealing with young adults.

“I brought up four kids, three boys,
and a girl, all by myself when my hus-
band passed away,” says Johnson. “It was
hard, but I think I did a good job, and I’m
using some of my techniques and
instincts when it comes to my Lothrop
kids.”

She says she tries to inquire into the
lives of her residents and let them know
someone is interested in how they are
doing. She attempts to get to know them
well so that they have a place to turn when
problems arise. At times, she is
approached when students need to talk
with someone.

“Things we talk about sometimes get
deep and serious, and I’ll be their second
mom,” says Johnson. “I don’t care. I just
don’t want to see these kids go wrong.
Their parents have spent too much money
and put in so much effort. I know how it
is.”

Parents, at times, call Johnson to tell
her how happy they are with the job she is
doing and to commend her for all of the
extra work she does for the students.
Sometimes students go out of their way to

introduce their parents and grandparents
to Johnson, something she loves about her
job.

While Johnson continually professes
how much fun she has while working, she
becomes serious when mentioning the
responsibility that comes with being a
security officer.

“It is a big responsibility,” Johnson
says solemnly. “You have to be aware of
everything, everybody, every event, and
that is a big deal. I want to be aware and
alert at all times, and I want to make sure
that everything is
alright from the time
I start all the way
until the time I end.”

R e c e n t l y ,
Johnson was select-
ed as the Pinkerton
Regional Service
Hero for the second
quarter of 1996.
Pinkerton and Pitt
work together to
provide security at
each of the resi-
dence halls for stu-
dents’ safety and
protection. Every
 quarter, the
Pinkerton—Umversity of Pittsburgh dis-
trict designates a service hero. Pinkeiton’s
service hero program was created with the
intention of recognizing security officers
who have shown exceptional customer
service. They must also participate in the
monthly “Excellence In Service” training
program. _

Along with the Regional Service
Hero distinction, Johnson was awarded a
check for $2,500.

“I was stunned,” Johnson says. “I’ve
never won anything in my life before. It
feels good to be rewarded for doing a
good job.”

Community and family are the two
ideas Johnson constantly refers back to
and are two things she promotes and fos-
ters everyday. Students are buying into it,
as even graduated students come back to
say hello and talk to” Johnson about their
jobs, spouses, and even kids.

“I love it here,” says Johnson as she
was interrupted by a phone ring.

“Hello,” Johnson says upon answer-
ing the phone, and her eyes twinkled as
she remarked that her son was on the line.
“He called about my grandchild’s birth-
day.”

Miss B, it seems, is always on the job.

it’s politically damaging to do so.

His agenda, to me, was as anti-young

now. Do you think it’s necessary and why?

Santorum: Absolutely! You have to be sen-

nothing better than to trap an American

That’s why you have diplomatic immunity,
so there isn’t the temptation to skewer some-

President should answer
lawsuit - AFTER term

Can a president of the United States be sued in a civil

Supreme Court as they ponder the case of Clinton v.
Jones.

No, he cannot. If the presidency were to be opened to
civil lawsuits, anyone with an attorney and a gripe could
conceivably sue a sitting president. Drawing the president
away from his duties in order to answer civil charges
instead of dealing with national issues would compromise
national security. Instead of worrying about the situation
in Bosnia or the deficit, the president would need to be
concerned with the numerous subpoenas he could receive
to appear in court if he is to be the target of civil lawsuits.

A clean fridge is no reason for suicide

 

The new year is a time for
renewal; I always think. So, in this
spirit, I decided to spend mine by
cleaning and organizing my refrig-
erator. The refrigerator is a symbol
of inner and outer selves, especial-
ly during January. Well, whether
one is working upon the psychic or
corporeal refrigerator, many of the
same techniques apply.

Refrigerators are often the
repository of good intentions —
those leftovers you are going to
make into soup and the cheap but-
ter instead of the premium brand. I
even found last year’s receipt for
school books from the Pitt
Bookstore in my freezer. I am not
sure how it got there, but one thing
I am reasonably sure of is that even
with the inﬂated prices, those
books were still more of adealthan
the cheap butter, which no one in
my family (including me) actually
wants to eat

The thing to do with any clean-
ing and reorganizing task is to
remember that: a) you have never
made good soup, and b) even if you
did, you’d probably forget to come
home and eat it since on the way
home from school you pass ﬁfteen
fast food outlets, most with drive-
thrus at which the demands of your
rumbling stomach often outweigh
considerations of taste and eco-
nomics. The rumbling stomach
often has a way of overruling such
high-minded ideals as leftover soup
and bank accounts. Thus, we ﬁnd
our psychic and corporeal ideals
are, as usual, at opposite ends of the
spectrum.

Ruthlessness is required to rid
oneself of baggage; however, the
key part of the equation is that bag-

gage, like chaos, is always increas-
ing. What is a hapless human to

do? One strategy is to do nothing; ’

leave everything lying about, and
wait for Channel 11 News to come
to your house in about 20 years
with a “breaking news” story of
how you live in squalor with 19
cats, towering stacks of newspa-
pers, and empty milk cartons. Your
house is now full, and you are
reduced to camping on the porch.

The other strategy is to do
everything — cataloguing the con-
tents of one’s reﬁigerator, balanc-
ing one’s checkbook, and other
extremes of eﬂiciency. But, in fact,
like New Year’s resolutions them-
selves, what most of us do is a little
of one and a bit of the other, good
intentions and bone idleness ﬁght-
ing constantly for supremacy in our
humdrum little lives. We ﬁnd that
while the dishes may not be done
one week, the laundry is, or vice
versa.

However, I must confess that
while this is usually the case, there
are some moments when ALL is
organized and in order. This has
happened to me only once in the
past year. I was so excited that I
invited a friend over to see my
handiwork. The clean laundry was
stacked neatly in the drawers; the
carpets were swept; the books were
on the shelf. Her reaction? Sheer
terror. As she went into the kitchen
to get a beer, she exclaimed, “My
god, I can’t believe it! The dish
drainer is even hanging on a hook!”
Her eyes widened, and she gave
me a hard look. “You’re not about
to kill yourself or anything are
you?” she inquired with equal parts
of concern and irony, taking a ner-
vously large swig of beer. Her eyes
swept over the immaculate kitchen
counters; she ran her ﬁnger over

the blinds, and looked startled
when her ﬁnger remained pink and
unbesmirched by the dust of days
gone by.

I had to confess that I wasn’t
actually thinking of killing myself
when I had ﬁnally achieved my

goal of organization and cleanli- .

ness; however, it oocuned to me

that if a dreadful accident should -

befall me, it might be the ﬁrst time
in history when I wouldn’t be
embarrassed to die and have my
friends enter my abode to pack up
my meager possessions. But no, I
was planning on living in my
newly pristine house because that
was really the point of all my
efforts — to enjoy the fruits of my
labor. However, it suddenly
occurredtomethatthatwouldbe
the ultimate irony as another friend
expressed —— he no longer plays the
lottery based upon his conviction
that upon winning a million dollar
jackpot, his health would start to go
rapidly downhill.

I must be more optimistic than

I admit to myself because I still _

play the lottery; but of course, my
household aﬂ’airs have done noth-
ing but degenerate. It starts small
—— a pile of laundry here, some
dirty dishes there, a bit of Chinese
food rotting quietly in its carton in
the refrigerator. Well, I was trauma-

tized into letting standards slip.

back towards the status quo when
my girlfriend, after drinking her
beer, decided to visit the bathroom.
As she climbed the stairs, she
warned me in a voice laden with
doom, “If there is a toilet roll in the
toilet roll holder —- I’m outta here.”
There was, and she was — I give
up.

p.r. taylor is humbly camped out on
her porch as her possessions have
taken control of her house.

Looking at the facts of Clinton v. Jones, why didn’t
Paula Corbin Jones bring her lawsuit against Clinton
when he was the Governor of Arkansas and allegedly
harassed her? If Clinton did make unwanted sexual
advances in a hotel room in 1991, why did she wait until
he was president to bring about her lawsuit? This appears
rather suspect.

To open the presidency to public prosecution would
render the special status of that institution virtually use-
less. If President Clinton is allowed to be civi1ly—tried,
what will be next? Disgruntled Arkansas state employees
who have an axe to grind about a gubernatorial veto of a
raise in salary they feel they deserved in the fiscal year
1988? How much time and energy could a president focus
on the duties and responsibilities of the executive branch
if he is constantly being called into court for things he
may or may not have done before he was president?

Questions such as these new face the Supreme Court
as they weigh the arguments and issues in Clinton v.
Jones. Hopefully, they will decide in favor of the sancti-

ty of the presidency.

Women's squad
battling for BE
title yet again

__Matt Townsend

 

For the women’s swim team, a successful

season hinges on the development of its young .

talent. They are without a senior, but are 12
strong in the junior class.

“We are very young, not having any seniors.
Our junior class didn’t come in as one of the top-
recruited classes. Now they have developed into
a much stronger group, and that helps the rest of
the team,” said Head Coach Marian Cassidy-
Keen.

Juniors Leslie
Becki, Buffy Smith, and
Megan McNallen are tri-
captains this year.
Because of injuries,
Becki and Smith will
miss most of the season.
This might have left a
vacancy in team leader-
ship, but the junior class
as a whole filled the spot.

“We have such a
strong junior class this
year, and they have led as
a whole. It’s been nice to
have such strong leader-
ship from so many peo-
ple,” said Keen.

Last winter the
team went 7-4 in the dual
meet season and placed
sixth at the Big East
Championships. It was
the worst finish for Pitt
in the 14-year history of Big East swimming.
This is not simply Pitt diminishing in talent; in
fact, the team has gotten faster each of the past
three years. Big East women’s swimming has
exploded in recent years, with more schools giv-
ing support and funding. Pitt is not yet fully
funded, but Keen expects to be in two years.

“We are at a point now where our team is
markedly better than where we have been. The

As the Panthers stand at the midway point of their ‘96—
’97 season at 4-3 in the Big East Conference, they are con-
ﬁdent that they can possibly reach the level of success
achieved in the ‘95-’96 season when they ﬁnished in the Top
25 and second in the conference.

Head Coach Chuck Knoles is looking forward to the
Big East championships from February 19-22 at Rutgers
University based on some of the individuals who are per-
forming well at this point in the season. i

This is the ﬁrst time Pitt
has not hosted the champi-
onships since joining the Big
East in 1982. Some of the
leaders for this year’s squad
are blue—chip freshman Jerry
Koller in the relays; junior Eric
Stefanski in the 200 freestyle;
freshman Brian Elko in the
200 backstroke; junior
Jonathan Haggerty in the 200
and 100 ﬂy; freshman’Jeremy
VanEpps in the breaststroke;
and sophomore Brett Collins
and junior Pete Hezky in the
distance relays. i

“We got whipped by N.C.
State and are looking forward
to closing out the season on
strong and taking our young
team to the Big East
Championships with a vision
toward the future,” said
Knoles.

counting on leadership from the team’s three seniors: John
Soulakis, Mike Speerschneider, and Eric Stefanski, who is

against West Virginia on January 18 followed by away

tough thing is that our conference
has improved as well. We had a
really solid conference meet last
year with a lot of lifetime bests,
and we finished sixth. In results, it
may look like we have gotten
worse when our times are better
than last year, and that can be frus-
trating,” said Keen.

A realistic goal for this team is
a top-five finish in the Big East.
Contending with champs like
Villanova, Notre Dame, and
Miami may be too ambitious for
Pitt. Swimming is an individual
sport as well, and this year Keen is
looking for a few swimmers to
make the NCAAs. Success there
will help the team’s chances at a
top 25 ranking and some national
recognition. This will help recruit-
ing and team support. Keen sees
sophomore Samantha Chabotar
competing in the distance events,
freshman Beth Grube in the back-
stroke, and freshman Liz Perry in
butterﬂy as possible NCAA quali-
fiers.

“We want to have a strong
conference showing. But in all
honesty, for as deep as that confer-
ence is, it’s going to take a while
for us to win it. It’s not going to
happen overnight,” said Keen.

College

- New Pitt Head Coach Walt Harris
made four more appointments to his
staff this week. Former Denver Broncos
coaching assistant J .D. Brookhart, 32,
was named tight ends coach for the
Panthers. Buddy Morris, whose first
stint as Pitt’s strength and conditioning
coordinator lasted from 1980-1989, is a
co—creator of “The Pitt Iron Works”
weightroom.

“Only the people at Hallmark Cards
could put into words the way I feel right
now,” Morris said.

Larry Coyer, who served as Iowa
State’s defensive coordinator and line-
backers coach the past two years, will
take over the Panther defense.

Bob J unko, former defensive coor-

dinator at Kent, is the new defensive V‘

line coach for the Panthers. Finally, Bill
McGovern replaces Tony Pierce as the
secondary coach.

The only other vacancy on the staff
is offensive line coach. Former Pitt
assistant Joe Moore, who was most
recently with Notre Dame, is reportedly
interested in the job.

0 Delegates at the 91st NCAA
Convention voted 169-150 ‘to allow
scholarship athletes to work part—time
jobs. Also, a vote of 173-145 passed a
measure that will ease requirements on
freshman eligibility. In terms of the
freshman Proposition 16, students who
don’t qualify academically in their first
year can now get back their fourth year
of eligibility. These new regulations go
into effect August 1.

back after suffering severe personal
problems that nearly ruined her career,
lost in the first round of the Sydney
Invitational to unseeded American
Jolene Watanabe. Capriati, who com-
mitted 69 unforced errors in the match,
broke down at a press conference fol-
lowing the match and expressed her

they can chew. Massachusets governor
William Weld has put 31 Boston Creme

Thompson is betting 31 wheels of
cheese and 31 pounds of bratwurst. The

ODK SENIOR OF THE YEAR AWARD

Applications are being accepted for the Senior of the Year
Award of Gamma Circle of Omicron Delta Kappa Society. The
Award recipient will be recognized at the Honors Convocation on
Friday, February 28, 1997. Any senior graduating in 1997 is
eligible for this award. Candidates will be evaluated on the basis
of character, scholarship, leadership, and activities. Applications

shall consist of a stone in the ODK walk between Heinz Chapel
