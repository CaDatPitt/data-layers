CARLSON’S, FIVE
MEETS TARTANS
HERE I_I_)_IIIcIII

Panthers Favored To Take
Thirteenth Game In Row

After enjoying a. long rest fol-
lowing their game last week with
Notre Dame, Pitt's basketeers will
swing into action again tonight
when they encounter Carnegie Tech
at the stadium court. The Pan-
thers will be out to cop their tenth
straight game from the Tartans as
well as their twelfth this year and
their nineteenth straight.

The Panthers met the Tartan
earlier this year when they beat
gem on the Tartan’s own court 24-
The Panther subs will probably
see a great deal of action in this
game which Pitt should cop easily.
Eddie I-Iirschberg, ‘Rip Collins, _
Montgomery and Eddie Baker wil
no doubt be given plenty of action.

To Play in East

Following this game the Pan-
thers will have another idle spell,
due to ﬁnalexams. But next Fri-
day, following the completion of
the exams, the Panthers will board
a train for the East where they
will play two games, one with Syra-
cuse February 1 and one with
Fordham. February 3.

Coach Lew Andreas has another
one of his fine teams at Syracuse
this year. His boys made a west-
ern trip early this year and copped
the majority of their games.

Last year the Fordham team won
18 games out of 19 starts and were
generally regarded as the eastern

. intercollegiate champions. :

 

TANKERS TRAI
FOR N. Y. TRIP  

 

The varsity mei-men are prepar-
ing for their invasion of Army and
New‘ York University January 31.
P. J. Corr, swimming coach, is de-
pendnig on his men to make a good
showing at both of the meets, for
they are in line shape and will be
eager to push waves against both of
these strong teams.

The swimmers who will make the
trip are Captain Wooldridge, George,
Harper, Jackson, Schmeiler, Stoffan,
Swensen and Underwood. Wool-
dridge is turning in good time for
the sprints and will be able to give
the West Pointers a good exhibi-
tion of swimming as will his team-

mates.
Meet Wash-Jeﬁ

Following the return of the Corr-
men, they will engage the Wash
and Jeff team in the Keystone Ath-
letic Club pool. Saturday, February
8, at 8 p. in. Last year the Pan-
thers were able to win by a big mar-
gin, but this year the Presidents
have a strong team that will be a
good match for Pitt’s mermen.

At this meet the freshmen will
meet the Kiski Pre team. Last
year the prep schoo boys took the
measure of the yearling Panthers,
and this.year they will come here
with an even stronger team.

A large turnout is expected at
this meet as it will be the Panther’s
ﬁrst home engagement.

IRISH QUINTET
  12TH VICTIM

With the entire Pitt team dis-
playing an impressive defense and
workmgtogether as a perfect unit
to ﬂash Coach Carlson’s speedy of-
fense, the Panthers crushed Notre
Dame here last Saturday night to
tally their eighteenth straight vic-
tory, the eleventh successive bas-
ketball victory this season, and to
even up the series of four games
glayed between the two teams to

ate.

 

 

Pitt led from the start and at half-

time the score stood 20 to 9. In the
second half the visitors were held to
a measly four points, the Pitt subs
ﬁnishing the game. The final score
fguiigl Pitt 20 points to the good,
0 ‘ c

The Notre Dame basketball play-
ers expressed their thoughts after
the game in the dressing room: ‘

"Hyatt?--good boy. There's no
doubt about Hyatt. But that little
Zehfuss is every bit as fast and
sure.” ‘

“They’re the best club we’ve met-
yet, but I think they played over
their heads.”

7 “We had a bad night. On any
other night we might have taken
them over."

“When we got behind, we got
reckless and in ‘order to catch up
we tried wild long shots.”

.“We get another crack at them.
That’s one consolation.”

Up until the time the Weekly went
to press no ollicial word,-had been
received to confirm a persistent ru-
mor that is bein circulated to the
effect that Cha es W. Bowser, as-
sistant football coach at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, has signed a
contract to coach the grid squad at
Bowdoin College, one of the coun-
try's ‘oldest institutions ‘of learning‘
at Brunswick, Maine. Neither the
athletic council at -Bowdoin. or Bow-'
ser himself, who is out of town, have
veriﬁed this report. I I" ~ V

Pl LAM AWARDED
BOW“ 9"?  

The first bowling tournament ever?
played by the fraternities of the in- ,
terfraternity councilwas brought to
a close I last’ _’Thursday I when ‘Pi
Lambda Phi overwhelmed the Sigma
Alpha Mu men, 655-573,‘ 698-679‘.
The Old Gold; cup-winning Pi lamb
crew was composed of Jerry~'Rose‘n-.
berg, Sidney Rosenberg, Morton
Baker. Eddie Jacobs and Leonard
Linton.‘ The runner-up S. A. M.
lineup, Jerry Barniker, Alex BIum-
bergei-,‘P‘aul Friedman, Sid Glad-
stone and Milt Shainberg. _

In the closing games the Samrrnesl
fell below form. Samberg, a'.con--
sistent 160 bowler, came through
with a ﬂat 100 and a 140. Fried-
man and Barniker each fell below
the century‘mark in one game. Glad-
stone was in a slum , while Blam-
berger alone showe any bowling
ability. In a practice game they
rolled 790 to top their official high.
score in.the tournament,"719, rolled
in the Phi Gain game.

Linton High Scorer

On the other hand the Pi Lambs
kept their feet. on the ground and
their heads up. to make one of the
most beautiful showings of the tour-
nament. Linton rolled 168 and 166'
to lead, both teams as high scorer.
Jacobs dame through with a strike
in the seventh frame of the second
game to assure a Pi Lamb’ triumph.
Baker rolled two consistently good
games. ' The Rosenberg, brothers
both did some nice rolling in both
contests. I - .  I

The opening games of the tour-
nament were played December 11
and 12. The results of these games
left the Phi Kap-Alpha Phi, Kappa
Nu-S. A. M., Lamba Chi-Sigma Chi
and"-P-i Lamb-Phi Delt games to be
run off" on 'J’anuaryI 9. Further
elimination ‘on the ﬁfteenth cut out
two moi-egames, leaving the Phi
Gam-S. A. M. and Pi Lam-Lambda
Chi frays with the two winners com-
ing together in the ﬁnals.

A consolation tournament was
run after the ﬁrst two‘ nights for
those teams defeated in ‘the, first
round. In the second series neith-
er PhiiKap nor Kappa‘Sig showed
up, leaving Sigma.Chi ride through,
to the ﬁnals after they had topped"
Phi Ep, this year’s winner in the
horseshoe tournament. Omega Del-
ta and Delta Tau .Delta . licked
Theta Chi and S. A. E., respective-_
ly, to light it out in the semi-ﬁnals.

The Delts'n6t only came through
but took two out of three from the
Sigma Chis to gain the consolation
cup given by. the interfraternity
council, the scores, 590-526, 514-
612, 587-558. Porter, Gray Doctors,
Hilleman and Sacger rolled for the
Delts with Neil’ re lacin Porter in
the last game. . ays, alz, Ben-
der, Anderson and Johnston could
not_ stave oil’ defeat for the Sigma

Chis. I
Tourney A‘ Success .
Nat Schupper,-I member of the in-
terfraternity athletic committee, was
in charge of all the games which
were played on the Center-Neville
Bowlin Alleys. The sportsman-
ship o Pitt fraternity II men was
shown by the fact that not a sin-
gle argument was brought up.
IMr. Theodore Biddle, ‘assistant to
the dean of men, said that he be-
lieved the tournament a complete
success. “It certainly was a com-
lete success in every way. There
is no ‘doubt that it ‘will be continued
next year.” It was Mr. Biddle’s
suggestion at the beginning of the
semcéster that initiated the tourna-
inen ‘ ‘ .

Notre Dame had a real football
team, but basketball is another
thing. Your Scout predicted an
eight-point victory on the court for
the Panthers over the Irish, but we
giust have been thinking about foot-

. 1-.0?’ ~ ‘I I
The mention of football
brings to us the oft quoted
~phrase about going "out for
football and “seeing the world.”

How about going out for the

debating team and touring the

South? .

Johnny Phillips, the roommate of
a. certain column writer and a

Imighty good roommate when it

comes to furnishing Vicks salve,
will leave next Tuesday for a
pleasure trip through the South, un-
der the guise of debating. Seems

funny that these debate trips South

always come off in the midst of a
cold winter and just when final
exams are scheduled.

.

A welcome similar to the one
the Pitt football team received
upon their return from Califor- I
nia, should be accorded the
members of the‘ debating team
before they leave. All students
interested should meet with the
Campus Scout in section 18,
tier 5 of the stadium, at 6:30
o’clock, Monday . morning. To
quote Phillips, “We can't do ‘any
worse. than the football team
did out in California.”

, . ,_,_,o__.

To leave debating, which by the
way is almost as vigorous as foot-
ball when this man Phillips is in-

volved, and to return to football we

would like to make it known that
the Campus Scout is heartily
against Assistant Coach Charley
Bowser’s leaving Pitt and going to
Bowdoin College as football. coach
next fall, as rumored. Charley is

one of the cleverest, ﬁrmest and

most efficient fellows in the coach-
ing game. We still remember him
ashead coach _at Grove City, where
he engineered some clever victories
over Geneva College. If he ‘leaves

fPitt, the Panthers will be losing

much in the coaching line. ,
. I —-o-- ‘

Next Tuesday night, your
Scout plans to attend the an-
nual football banquet. providing
the comp arrives in time, and
witness the election of Josh
Williams to captain next year’s
football team. Never mind this
prediction, fellow students and
players, because last year we
ran the pictures of live fellows
whom we ﬁgured as the logical
choice and it was not until
after the election that we ran
the right fellow, Luby Diineolo.
We may be wrong, but at any
rate any of the four logical
candidates will make a real
captain. Baker, Tully and Willin-
chus are all ‘ capable’ fellqws.

_.o_... _
Guessing football captains, at its
best, is a much harder job than pre-
dicting football scores. Maybe after

I the banquet we will go back to foot-
_ ball predictions.

As the parting shot of the
week, the Scout ﬁgures the
game tonight with Carnegie
Tech as a Pitt victory by about

~ out ofjﬁve tries. '

'- Results of a tally ‘of every try

Pitt-Notre Dame -Ibasketball con-
test last Saturday evening, clearly
indicate.theI accuracy of the Panther
cagers and the‘ wobbly ‘shooting of

tives. " _ ,

Eighty-three ﬁeld attempts were
registered. during the forty minutes
of "play ‘averaging slightly" more
than two per minute. Out ‘of this
total Pitt accounted I- for thirty-
seven tries. and the Irish, forty-six.
The Panthers made fourteen of the
attempts good, while their - oppo-
nents converted only four tries into
two-point tallies. ,  ‘ .

II'I‘he total attempts. were almost
evenly _ divided between" the two
halves,‘ forty-one and forty-two.
counts being made ‘in. thefﬁrst and
second halves, I‘ ‘respectively. Pitt
scored nine ﬁeld, goals in the first
half and five in the second. Notre
Dame scored three -in the first and
a.’ measly one in-the second ha’lf.i- 1

‘ As the Pitt team scored fourteen-
out of a possible thirty-seven, the
“batting average” may» be calcu-
lated to be .378 or almost 38' per
cent. The Notre Dame team netted
four ‘successes out of forty-six’ for
an’—~ave'rage of .087, or about nine
per cent. '

Hyatt led in—number"of ﬁeld goals
-—four out of ten tries. Les Cohen
had the best average-—three goals
out of four atteinpts. Zehfuss was
next with three out of five. Arturo
scoredthree out of nine. S. Kowal-
lis scored‘ his tally in the waning
minutes of the game. Gavin, Notre
Dame, led his mates with two goals.

nounced this week that hehad en- :

tered the Millrose meet to be held’
next month in New York. Pete will

the most highly advertised. race of

the eastern indoor season. The race I
will be at 600 yards, a longer dis- '
times. than Pete has ever covered be- I.

foreina dual meet. . I .
IIf_Pete hopes to win, however, he
will need to show, a vast improve-
ment over the form he displayed
last Saturday at the Brooklyn. Col-

leges Games. In that meet, Pete?

ﬁnished a poor fourth in the 440,
won, in the ordinary time of 51 sec-
onds.I- With some real training
though, Pete should rapidly regain
his form of last year when -he ran
the 440 around 48 seconds.

‘ A Again incited to prompt ‘action
when -Pai~'k’s 7report- pointed out that
the athletic council had done-every-‘Ev
thing possible to’ discourage stu-_
dents from. attending the Pitt-Notre
Dame ‘basketball’ game, last Satur-
day, with the evident. intention of
‘selling more. ;seats-_ to .outsiders,
Council promptly referred this‘ mat-
ter to" the. investigation committee.
with explicit instructions to askan
explanation from the proper author-
ities ’for this action.‘ The explana-
tion is to state .why students" were
subjected to a cross-examination be-
fore tickets ’ were ‘issued to them;
why students-. could‘ texchange no
more than one book; and why -such
a short time for ‘exchange. of tick-
ets was 7provided.. Anatteinpt to
-prevent‘ the recurrence of such a
situation and to devise a satisfac-
tory . system of‘ ticket ‘exchange is
also to be ‘worked out by the ath-
letic department andfcouncil. '' 1 -

Park ‘was invited to attend the
remainder of council's sessions this
year in keeping with his own ‘sug-
gestion that the editor be made an
associate member? of ‘council ‘be-

current among'or'ganizations "of the
student body. - » * " ‘ I  ’

‘ .vAfter "navigating-' the: first. two
readings the prop'o,se,d constitution-
al amendmentt providing a nomina-
tion committee with power to _name4
candidates for council offices met
with unanimous defeat in its third
reading. When it was pointed out
that the committee would be com{
poseclof a majority of inexperi-
enced members elected in thespring
[council elections, that its choice
could be made on,no better grounds
than‘, nominations from the ﬂoor, the.
proposed change in the constitution
lost all supporters and fell ‘by the
wayside. * » ' d
The second amendment making
Kleeb’s committee on student loy-
alty a permanent committee of stu-
dent council, however, passed with-
out a dissenting vote.‘ - ‘ ‘
Council came prepared to listen
