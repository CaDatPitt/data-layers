HARRISBURG, Pa. -— Memorizing

talking points,,eating lunch in the

— capital and having private meet-

ings with legislators in the halls of
power. « R» ,4

On Tuesday, 150 Pitt students’
tasted the life of a lobbyist during
Pitt Day in Harrisburg.

At7a.m. students boarded charter
buses outside the William Pitt Union
to make the three-hour drive east to
the state capital. They wouldn’t return
to the University until after 9 p.m.

Pitt students, alumni and staff .

were _in Harrisburg to lobby legisla-
tors in an attempt to mitigate Gov.
Torn Corbett’s proposed 30 percent
cut to state appropriations for state-
rela'ted schools in the next ﬁscal
year. ' '

Students broke up into groups
of about ﬁve or six to be guided by
a designated group leader to state .
legislative meetings set up by Paul
Supowitz, Pitt’s vice chancellor for
governmental relations.

Junior Sarah Tamburelli said she
signed up for Pitt Day in Harrisburg‘
for the ﬁrst time this year because

"-she‘wa’nted “to preserve the Pitt ex-

perience. V
“The legislators are getting to see‘
us and feel our presence, and we’re
getting to learn from them too,” she
said. “Because of the diversity of
people you meet at Pitt, it’s not just
an education, it’s a life experience.” .
Students were encouraged to talk
to the state representatives from their
home districts.‘ «
Junior Kaitlyn Suber was disap-
pointed to ﬁnd that her home sena-
'to.r, Republican Bob Robbins of Dis-

- trict 50, which includes Crawford

and Mercer and parts of Butler and
Lawrence counties -— was not in'the
cap ital that day. _

HARRISBURG, Pa. — Pitt stu-
dents and faculty traveled to Har-

’ risburg to represent the Univer-

sity and’speak out against Gov.
Tom Corbett’s proposed budget‘
cuts Tuesday in efforts to keep
state appropriations up and tu-
ition down. _ _

But the driving force behind
the 119 percent increaselin Pitt’s
tuition between 2000 and 2010
remains a source of contention
between legislators and the
state—related universities that are
potentially facing a 30 percent 1
state funding cut if the proposed
budget goes through.

“That tuition increase. can’t
be blamed on the state,” said

“But Chancellor Mark Norden-

ment at Pitt Day in Harrisburg.

“There is an assertion made
that there is no association with

state appropriation. That is de-
monstratively untrue,’f Norden-
berg said. “Tuition increase can
be attributed almost exclusively
to state appropriations.” ‘
Nordenberg, alongpwith 150
Pitt students, alumni and facul-
ty, petitioned legislators to stop

the proposed 30 percent cut to ‘

the University’s<funding, which
would mark two back-to-back
years of cuts. Though tuition
will likely go up regardless, Pitt
students would see a smaller in-
crease with more‘ state funding.

the contributions that the state-

But the state is dealing with
a budget, and the universities

might not be the top priority for

many legislators.

“It is a budget of difficult

Sometimes one actor is all it takes to bring
attention to a cause.

At 8:30 tonight, Courtney Nassar, a gradu-
ate of Point Park University, will star in the
one-woman play “My. Name is Rachel Corrie,”
which depicts the life and death of an American
who was killed in the Gaza Strip in 2003.

The play, which has been a source of con-
troversy since it debuted in London’ in 2006,

V tells the story of the 23-year-old American

peace activist who was killed by an Israeli
bulldozer in the Gaza Strip. A
“It’s very dark. It’s very controversial. But
its also very human because it’s about this one
woman,” said Ryan Branagan, president of
Pitt’s Students forjustice in Palestine.

When Sameena Nazir was a high school senior
in Pakistan, she began to see the effects of
war in neighboring Afghanistan. The nearby
conﬂict would have a tremendous impact on
women in her home country.

One year, Nazir said, her school had music
and dancing. The next, it was all gone.

_ In college, Nazir said she could not par-
ticipate in various social activities because
of her sex. She ‘said women were constantly
under attack, but many women’s groups met
despite the risks. .

“It was horrible, but it invigorated action
for change,” Nazir said at her lecture titled “A
Day in the _Life of a Pakistani Woman” Tues-
day. I
Pitt’s Women’s Studies Program and the
Graduate School of Public and International
Affairs hosted Nazir, who is both the executive
director of the Potohar Organization for De-
velopment Advocacy and the president of the
Pakistan section of the Women’s International
League for Peace and Freedom. 1

Nazir is visiting the United States to

‘ speak before the United Nations on behalf

ofWILPF. ‘

Nazir said that she and her colleagues work
to promote peace and equality for women in
Pakistan, but she said they often encounter

"threats and harassment from the Taliban and

Pakistan’s domestic intelligence agency.

Through her. work, Nazir has lobbied for if

laws that protect women against abuse.

“In 2010 we passed a law against sexual
harassment in the working places,” Nazir said
to a room of about 15 people in Posvar Hall.
“We also passed laws against acid throwing
and child marriage.” .

Before Pakistan passed such laws, it was

legal for husbands to throw acid in the faces of -

disobedient wives. It was also legal°for young

, girls to be married off.

Nazir also mentioned that education up
to the lath grade is now a constitutional -right
for all Pakistani citizens.

She said that education is important be-
cause Pakistani women have a 27 percent lit-

eracy rate. She noted that Pakistan is mainly A

a. rural country, which contributes to illit-
eracy. “ .

Even though they have worked to create
new laws, Nazir said the human rights or-
ganizations face difﬁculty when they try to
inform women of the laws in rural areas. She
said abused women often don’t know they
can take action. .

. Nazir gave a brief summary of the history
of Pakistan, a country that was deeply affected
by warinAfghanistan. _, ' ‘ 5

Nazir said Pakistan’s progressive laws
changed drastically when the‘ Soviet Union

invaded Afghanistan in 1979, starting a war _

that would continue for a decade. . I

gomery and Chester counties and the
leading Democrat on the Education Com-
mittee, agreed with his Republican coun-
terparts that the University has an “equal
responsibility” when it comes to keeping
tuition low. _ ' _

“The funding of higher education and
keeping it within means that people, can
afford is a two—way street,” he said, re-
ferring to the University and the state.
“Someone’s going to pay, and it’s going to
be the students and their families.” v

To reduce the costs imposed on fami-

lies, Dinniman proposed that the legis-

’ lature consider closing the “Delaware

loophole,” through which companies
establish Delaware residences to avoid
Pennsylvania’s 9.99 percent corporate
income tax. .

He also proposed raising the severance
tax, a tax on non—renewable resources
such as natural gas. He was not in favor

- of an increase in income tax or imposing

new taxes. A .
"Rep. Scott Conklin, D—Centre, who is on
the appropriations and education commit-

tees, agreed with Dinniman about closing

the Delaware loophole.
He said that his first priority is restor-
ing education funding and that a failure

to do so will have repercussions for the
University.

“Pitt competes in a world market.
Pitt can compete on world market with
lower funding, but students’ tuition will
go up dramatically,” Conklin said. “Every
university needs to make a decision. Are
they willing to cut back or do they want
to compete?” -

He said that Pitt’s primary competition

comes from private institutions and that

Rep. Brad Roae, R-Crawford, said that al-

cakes and Politics, usually fea-
tures a local politician who gives

‘ Thanks to Graduate‘ and

President Nyasha Hungwe, who

reached out to the governor’s .

‘office thisyear, studentswill

. have the opportunity to gain an ‘

understanding of Corbett and
his budget cuts —which have

caused enormous concern in the ,

Pitt community. A
It’s not often that Pitt stu-
idents have the opportunity to
meet with such a pivotal ‘ﬁgure,
especially one that has made such
provocative cuts to the funding
received by Pennsylvania’s state-
related universities. ‘
Over the pasttwo years,. Cor-
bett has proposed to cut Pitt’s

year, Pitt saw a 22 percent reduc-
. tion in state funding. , ’

That slashnput the administra-
tion in a difficult position as far
as setting the University’s budget
for .this school year. Ultimately,

Pitt implemented an 8.5 percent

increase in tuition for"in—s.tate
students and a 4 percent increase
for out-of-state students.

As a result, Pitt students-aren’t
exactly on good terms with the
governor. Thankfully, on Friday,
their questions will be he_ard.

During a'question—and-an-
swer session, Corbett will answer
pre-screened questions from the

 

audience, and attendees will have
the chance to write in additional
questions during the event. ‘
More than likely, Corbett will ‘
try to justify his budget proposals

and general position that univer- »

sities in the stateddeserve cuts to

‘ their state appropriations. . 

He hasn’t yet said how cutting “
state funding will work to lower

‘tuition, which seems. to be alliuge?-’ -

void in reasonto slash ﬁinding in ‘
a politically expedient way._
Even though the questions‘
will be reviewed, thegovernor
must make clear his reasoning
for these extreme cuts, as well -
as address the criticisms of many

studentswho have been aversely I

affected by them.
‘The fact that he is taking ques-
tions is commendable, but who '_

. , careslif it doesn’t bring results? ,-

V Thankfully, it seems like the
student body is taking advan-
tage of the free event, and tick-
ets have been selling rapidly. But
to make this event a--success, we '
must makesure both to gain an if

’ ‘understanding of Corbett’s.pro'-.

The governor will also. visit
the Swanson School‘ofEngineer-* 

ping and the Center for Energy, so 2 -
Pitt’s accomplishments and con— 

tributions to research and the 10- 
cal economy will be prominent.
Corbett is the pérfecfperson

to bringto campus at this time, ,

and we applaud GPSA and the
Student Government Board for
working to make this event hap-
pen. We are in prime position to‘
demonstrate our importance to

as heck. How’s that going? Are you
having fun registering for baby gifts
and so forth?

SM: Well, yes and no. I’m trying
to think outside the box, though.
-Instead of registering for the normal
baby items, I’m thinking of regis-
tering for a margarita maker, Red
Bull 24-packs and a muzzle (for the
baby). Noise-canceling headphones
aren’t‘on the list because I already
own those. I hope I’m not forgetting
anything.

MCOA: Are you worried about
the baby growing up to "become a
bratty, bumptious Chatterbox? If our
loins weren’t as barren as the Gobi
Desert,’we’d certainly be concerned
about such an outcome.

SM: Oh no, not at all. In fact,just
the other day I found myself in the

presence of some“motor-mouth '

kid who wouldn’t shut up about his
“Tom Hanks” video game. It took

a a while, but I realized it was actu-

ally a Tony Hawk video game. There

should be a Tom Hanks video game '

though.’ - - ’

MCOA: We agree. Perhaps the
game could feature a storyline that
explains why late-‘career Tom Hanks
now looks somuch like mid-career
Jim Belushi. But back to the baby-
having. Has watching a show like
“Hoarders,” where all those wretch-

ed souls let their waste pile up in
varioustcorners of the home or even
within the toilet itself, prepared you

“ for potty training? .

‘ SM: I’m more than prepared for
people to stop telling me about their
‘ children’s adventures in potty train-
ing. I realize not having to change

poopy diapers is life—altering for’

them, but I’d really appreciate it if
they tempered their excitement over
how their kids have tempered their
excretioris. Besides, if “Hoarders”

“is any indication, there’s a strong
chance their self—sufﬁcient rugijats
are going to become dysfunction-

.al adults who rush to stock up on
diapers the minute their plumbing
breaks. ' '

MCOA: Hey, speaking of great
shows, do you remember how on
“Full House,” little Michelle Tan-
ner would say “ouse cream” instead
of “ice cream” for no reason at all?

- And the laugh track would just go on
andon and on? Wasn’t that comedy
gold? I don’t think anythingthat ever
happened in the history of the world,
except for wlienjason Biggs had to

' simulate having sex with an apple

pie, comes close to approximating

- how funny that was. No, wait, that’s

not true. There was also that scene
in “Spaceballs” where Rick Moranis,
who’s playing some kind of Darth
'Vader—type character, asks his sec-

SM: I don’t know what any of

Starbucks and announced that he
thinks a woman wearing a bra and
panties from Victoria’s Secret is like

Letters to the editor

To the Editor, «

You mentioned in the article about the Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic shooting that “no under-
graduate academic work gets done there,” which is false. Every Pitt nursing student in the undergraduate
program has a clinical rotation at Western Psych. There are junior nursing students-doing their psych rota-
tion there every semester as well as senior students that maybe completing their senior practicum there. I
personally know a few students that work there as nursing aides, and we all walk through thelobby of the

-hospitafmany times during our undergraduate years. Please don’t forget about every nursing student that

has undergraduate academic work at Western Psych. We are luckythat it was Spring Break and that the Pitt
nursing students and other students of Pitt were not involved. - ‘ ‘

‘Thanks, .
Katherine Prior 7
‘School of Nursing ' ’
_ _ To the Editor,

. Whilel commend your effort to address the recent tragedy at Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, I

am shocked at your direct implications that (in reference to WPIC) “no. undergraduate academic work gets.

done there.” As a nursing student I completed an entire semester of work there and am quite connected to" the
institution. ..Yo.ur generalizationthat undergraduate students are somehow “disconnected” from this tragedy

is completely unfounded seeing as how the entirety of the nursing school (which is certainly part of the under-
graduate populatio_'n)’spends a great deal of time there. This includes many senior stuaents who are completing
— their 270 transitions clinical houfrstthere this semester and who were actually required to work at the facility over er

the break. I understand thatthe author of this articleinay not be a member of the nursing_school and may not
understand what this means to the students who work at the facility every day, but I would greatly appreciate
some recognition that there are in fact many members of the undergraduatecommunity whose lives will never
be the same, whose safety and security in the profession they have chosen may never return to normal.

As I said before, aside from this oversight'I appreciate the general tone of your editorial and commend The

"Pitt News staff for acknowledging those who worked efficiently and productively for ensuring the safety of
‘those who were present on March¢8. ' . -

Thank you for your time,

WRESTLING

I Pitt sends six athletes to national tournaent

. By Dustin Gabler
Stajfwri ter

Freshloff its team victory at the A

Eastern Wrestling League champi-
onships, the Pitt wrestling team is
sending six athletes on to compete
at the national tournament in St.
Louis. '

Anthony Zanetta, the Panthers’
125-pound junior, took home his

third EWL title with a 3-2 victory‘

March 4 but said it’s not hard to

forget about his championship

with just one competition left. -
“It’s behind us, and we’re fully

, focused on nationals,” Zanetta

said.

Sophomore P.J. Tasser said he
has always dreamed of making
the NCAAS and has turned his full
focus toward the national tourna-
ment. Pitt’s heavyweight qualiﬁer
capped-an exciting run at the EWL
tournament to take third place and
earn the last automatic bid.

“While the EWL tournament
was a great one for us, you have
to turn the page, forget about it
and focus on the NCAAS,” Tasser
said. “It is something you prepare
for year-round and something that
I dreamed about growing up.”

Tasser faces an extra challenge
as he enters the NCAA Tournament
because he didn’t wrestle heavy-

weight at all until the EWL tour-
nament. His success at the EWLs

~ earned him a bid to the NCAAs,

and he’s using the extra time to
prepare for the bigger wrestlers.
Like the others, he’s focusing on
his own wrestling skills and not
on the bigger wrestlers that he is
sure to face. . a I

“I feel that the extra time is ‘

going to help me as I’m becoming

more comfortable wrestling guys‘

that are bigger than me,” Tasser
said. - '
Fellow sophomore Shelton
Mack, Pitt’s 133—pound wrestler,
is also making his first trip to the
national tournament. Mack en-
ters nationals after losing his title
match at the EWL championships.
He said he’s using the loss as mo-
tivation for the last tournament of
the season.’ _

“I just have to keep the same fo-
cus that I’ve been training with all
season,” Mack said. “Taking a loss
late in the season gives you more
motivation to work hard.”

Junior Matt Wilps earned the
third seed in the tournament af-
ter his dominating 5-2 lead over
the second-seeded wrestler. While
most of his teammates are trying
to forget about their conference
matches, Wilps said he is looking

to build on his solid "showing after ‘
earning Most Outstanding Wres-_

tler at the EWL championships.
Wilps added that he’s working
on his own moves and wrestling ca-
pabilities to build his conﬁdence.
“I haven’t spent much time
looking at my opponents,” Wilps
said. “It’s best to just focus on your-

, self and make sure you’re conﬁdent

in your own attacks.”

While many wrestlers can get
caught up in looking at potential
rnatchups and the brackets. Pitt’s
wrestlers are avoiding much of the
talk about their draw and focusing
on their preparation.

Senior Tyler Nauman, the
only Panther other than Wilps to
be seeded, earned the No. 6 seed.
After seeing his initial draw, he
turned his focus back to wres-
tling.

“I looked at my bracket and saw
my draw,” Nauman said. ‘_‘After
that, I haven’t looked at it much. I

-know whatl need to do, and that’s /

wrestle my match and be myself on
the mat. If I do that, I’ll be success-
ful this weekend.”

Zanetta said he doesn’t want to
plan out his potential opponents.

“I just want to take it one match
at a time and focus on the task that
presents itself at that given time,”
he said. 7

trade Center..in St. Louis. I

GREGORIAN RANTS

Patterns predict
, tournament winner

By Greg Trietley
Senior Staff Writer

Last year,‘ Connecticut men’s bas-
ketball bucked a trend. With nine
losses in the regular season, the
Huskies became the ﬁrst team in
thenew century to win the NCAA
Tournament with such a poor re-
cord.

In the 10 years before Con-

necticut’s victory in 2011, every A

champion suffered no more than
six losses en route to the title. Post-
season success “always stemmed
from regular-season dominance.
Not with the Huskies.
Still, March V

one—third of the tournament’s
teams are now out of contention.
With 44 schools still battling,

. geography leads to another round

of cuts. _Thirty-six states haven’t
produced a champion in the last 30

years. Nearly half of the competi-

tion, burdened by states winless
since the 1980s, drops out here,
including Baylor, Memphis, New
Mexico, Missouri, Wisconsin, Gon-
zaga, Ohio State and Creighton.
Some underdogs remain in the
last 23 alive for the championship.
No. 13 seed Davidson, No. 15 seed
Lehigh and No. 15 seed Loyola

~ (Md.) all have survived this far,‘

as has California of the mediocre
' Pac-12.

Madness has its
patterns, as un-
predictable as
it might seem.
- Many of the 68
teams can be
ruled out. In
fact, you can pit
history against ‘
every last one
of them until
a single team
remains — the
champion.

-A ,No. 16

defeating Syracuse? Miniscule.
The odds of the Bulldogs winning
ﬁve more games after that? Impos-
sible. Cross them and their No. 16
brethren off the list of potential
champions. We’re down to 62.
Butback to Kemba Walker and
the Huskies, who set a new stan-
dard last season. Had a more dom-
inant program won it all, history
would "nix this year’s tournament
chances of Indiana (eight losses),
Baylor (seven), Ohio State (seven)
and 26 other schools. But Connect-
icut shattered the mold, and teams

with fewer than 10 losses remain‘

in the hunt for now.
A double-digit loss total still

1. eliminates 18 programs, includ-

ing Notre Dame, Xavier, Florida,

Cincinnati and,'yes, Connecticut, .

which went 20-13 this season. Over

1986 (LSU).
And since 2000, No. 8 seeds had

made it as often as No. 4 seeds did, '

But noteam ranked a No. 12 seed
—— or worse — has ever reached
the Final Four. That eliminates all
of our remaining darlings: Cali-

State, Davidson and Loyola.
. Whereas No. 8 and No. -11 seeds
do well historically, No. 7, No. 9

and No. 10 seeds, strangely, don’t. »

These seeds have been unsuc-
cessful in reaching the Final Four

since the tournament grew to 64

teams. ~

This eliminates a single
team that made it this far: Saint
Mary’s.

We’re down to the Sweet Six-
teen. Some regions fared better

‘ MEN'S BABKETBALI-_

Pittset to face Wottor

By Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editor

Three years ago, the Pitt men’s basketball
team narrowly defeated Wofford in the
2009-2010 season opener.

The Panthers _— just beginning to ad-
just to playing without Levance Fields,
S-am Young, Dejuan Blair and Tyrell Biggs
— struggled to come away with the 63-60
victory. But Pitt eventually found its stride,
not only in°the game, but for the rest ofthe
season. The Panthers ﬁnished 25-9 and tied
for second in the Big East standings with a
13-5 record, advancing to the second round
of the NCAA Tournament.

But while several players remain from that
team, three very important members have
departed: Brad Wanamaker, Gilbert Brown

‘' and Gary McGhe'e. This year’s team never

seemed to ﬁnd its way without them.
As a result, Pitt (17-16, 5-13 Big East)

will face off against Wofford.(19-13, 12-6 V
Southern Conference) at the Petersen Events_

Center once again —— this time in the College
Basketball Invitational, a minor postseason

tournament among 16 teams that weren’t .
selected for the NCAA Tournament or the _

National Invitation Tournament.

than others. Only Syracuse and Florida State
remain in the East, while the top six seeds
survived in the Midwest.

No one style of basketball has a histori-

cal advantage in the tournament. As long
as a program executes well, _it can win the
championship, whether it relies on 3-point
shooting (Kansas in 2008) or strong re-

bounding andjnside play (North Carolina.

in 2oo9). . «

But one statistic foreshadows a tumble in
March: steals. For possibly no reason at all, a
school in the top 15 in steals per game in_the

regular season has‘ never_ won the champi-

onship that year, as far back as easy—access
Internet statistics go.‘ This correlation does
in Syracuse and Louisville. It also_doesn’t
bode well for Virginia Commonwealth, Ohio,

Marquette or Mississippi Valley State, which’

all dominate the steals category but were
eliminated in previous steps. ‘

You do have to score though. Teams out— i

side the nation’s top 65 in scoring haven’t
won the championship in recent years re-

ti

garclless of the strength of their conferences.

~ Goodbye, Michigan State (70th), San Diego

State (95th), Florida State (124th), George-
town (143rd) and Michigan (202'nd).
Teams that-ﬁnish hot receive March buzz,
but the season’s start is equally as important.
The last six champions went undefeated

against unranked opponents in the ﬁrst “

month of the season. ~

That means overall.No. 1 Kentucky, which
lost at then—unranked Indiana on Dec. 10, is
out, as are Wichita State, UNLV, Temple and .
North Carolina. Four schools remain: Duke,
Kansas, Murray State and the Hoosiers. -

Conferencetournament results will help
discover the champion in the bunch, as ﬁve
of the past six national champioris won their
conference tournament the week before
March Madness began.

The only one of the four to do so this ‘

year? The 30-1 Murray State Racers, who.

‘won the Ohio Valley tournament. If history
holds, the No. 6 seed Racers, of all teams,,
' l

will win the 2012 NCAA Tournament.

Of course, last year these patterns said °.

Duke would defeat Kansas for the champion-
ship. Neither made the Final Four, so maybe
take this with a grain of salt. I

plate and hit a ground ball to the UN LV third
baseman who threw home for the force out.
However, the catcher dropped the ball, allow-
ing Cognigni to score. I

Pitt took full advantage of the error when
senior Kristen 'Cheesebrew’s sacriﬁce fly
brought home pinch runnerjessica Rhodunda

Pitt’s offense produced the winning run in the

Sevilla to score the game-winning run.
