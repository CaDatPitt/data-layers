A fire on the roof of
Wean Hall at Carnegie
Mellon ,University’s campus
filled the sky with black
smoke that could be seen all
over Oakland during rush
hour, yesterday evening.

Several Pitt students
originally thought the
flames might have been

coming from the Carnegie
Museum.

Don Hale, vice-president
of university relations for
CMU, said that nobody was
injured and the fire was con-
tained before it could spread
to the lower parts of the
building and do real damage.

According to Hale at 8
p.m., the official cause of

 

believe that a propane tank
on the roof of the building
was blown over by the wind,
causing the cap to break off
and release the gas.

At the time, maintenance
workers were using blow
torches for routine mainte-
nance work on the roof, and
the flame from the torches
ignited the highly ﬂammable
gas.

After the fire was out,
Hale said the authorities
checked the elevators and
wiring to be sure it was safe
for people to go back into
the building.

The fire started around
5:30 p.m., and people were
allowed back in the building
by 7:00 p.m.

Wean Hall houses the

the fire was not known.

Go for the groin, says speaker on sexual assault

Nora O'Neill
Staff Writer

A panel discussion entitled
“Confronting Violence Against Women
Globally” and an information fair covering
issues concerning violence against women
were held in the Ballroom of the William
Pitt Union last night.

The presentations were sponsored by
the YWCA of Pittsburgh as part of its third
armual Week Without Violence.

Many of the panelists were victims of
sexual assault and domestic violence.

For example, Gina Antimole, a date
rape survivor, recounted her experience as
a student at the Art Institute of Pittsburgh.

“I thought that nothing could ever hap-
pen to me. My rapist was my next door
neighbor. He didn’t look like someone to
fear, but I always felt uneasy around him,”
she said. “I was very ill one week, and I
woke to ﬁnd him on top of me. I couldn’t
stop what was happening, and when he left

he acted as though he belonged in my"

room and as though I welcomed his
advances.”

She went on to explain that she was
one of the “nine out of 10 women” not to
report her rape. In fact, she didn’t tell any-
one until she discovered that she was preg-
nant.

 

“We're not going
to put up with
violence  
anymore.”

Cl

Gwen Elliott,
Pittsburgh Police
commander

    

Nora O'Neill/Staff W'riter7 '

As a result of this event, she’s now a
member of Pittsburgh Action Against
Rape, an organization whose purpose is to
help protect women from getting raped.

Commander Gwen Elliott discussed
the response of the Pittsburgh Police to
such violent acts against women.

“We’re not going to put up with vio-
lence anymore,” said Elliott. “I think we
need to educate women more on how to
protect themselves from violent crime and
inform them of their options when they are

raped or abused.”

The infomiation fair included speaker
Marco Bucklen from Pittsburgh Action
Against Rape. Bucklen focused on the
importance of self-defense.

“I can’t stress enough the importance
of training,” he said. “A lot of people know
some of the vulnerable areas of their
attackers, the eyes, groin and knees, but
they need to know how to attack them
effectively so they can get away fast. The
chances of getting away are best when you

are first attack .” -

The panel also discussed speciﬁcs 0
how college women can protect them-
selves.

Antimole addressed the importance of
women being aware of the dangers in their
environment.

“Women should use common sense,”
she said. “They should be careful not to
place themselves in situations where they
mi t be vulnerable. Don’t walk home
alone late at night, and be careful about
making yourself more susceptible to vio-
lent crime with alcohol and drugs.”

Julie Evens, another representative
from Pittsburgh Action Against Rape, had
additional suggestions for for rape protec-
tion.

“I agree that women should take pre-
cautions, but we need to hold men account-
able for their crimes,” she said. “They are
the ones committing the violence. They
need to be shown that this carmot continue.
College men should be educated as well.”

Elliott concluded the discussion by
asking the audience to take part in the ﬁght
against violence.

“We need to create a zero-tolerance
environment. Everyone should join forces
with the organizations here and make a
commitment to do something.

Every Wednesday evening at 7:30, they
sit together on the sixth ﬂoor of the Union
waiting for the Student Government Board
meeting to begin.

Around 8:00, about the time when SGB
President Justin DalMolin announces the
open-ﬂoor segment of the meeting, all eyes
turn to Joe Gielata and Damon Hudac.

“You should be treated like royalty,”
Gielata told the SGB at a meeting in
September, shortly after the board was
accused of _misusing frmds. “You should ride
ﬁrst-class on airplanes and have your own
elevator in the Union.”

A few minutes later, he stood up again,
said he had thought about what he had said,
retracted his statements, and told SGB that
they should provide details about SGB
aifairs.

Hudac and Gielata, candidates for the
upcoming SGB election, attend every SGB
meeting, cunningly making suggestions and
cracking witty comments about issues
important to them like the above example.
But board members say the pairs comments
aren't productive. ’

In fact, the members say they take
Hudac's and Gielata's contributions as sar-
castic and sometimes mocking.

"They're completely out of line," said
SGB member Christa Douaihy.

Douaihy says the problem she has with
the pair is that they are not familiar enough
with the workings of SGB to comment on
them. She called the pair "attention-gettcrs."

SGB Business Manager Brian Ricmer
a .
"I ﬁnd them amusing," said Riemcr. "1
don't think they're positively impacting any-
ﬂ1ing.|l
Gielata and Hudacsay they became
interested in student government when they
attended the ﬁrst SGB t.own—ha1l meeting of
the 96-97 school year in September 1996.

They asked satirical and sarcastic ques-
tions concerning a controversy in which the

SGB spent close to $15,000 for computers
that the Allocations Committee did not
ve.

Lately, their concerns have been about
the recent accusations that SGB misused
fimds this summer.

Although Riemcr says he feels the two
are using SGB to "practice their wit," and all
of SGB feel they are being picked on by the
pair, Hudac and Gielata say the problems
they have with the SGB are not unique to
this government board.

"I just think the system has a bit of a
kink in it, as in these problems are
inevitable," said Gielata "I don't think it's the
particular fault of this SGB or any SGB in
the past. When the system's like that, you're
bound to have little problems."

Although Hudac and Gielata have
voiced their concerns to student government
for more than a year, they say SGB is ignor-
ing them.

"I was saying things, and not only was
nothing being done about them, but I don't
think my concerns were even being listened
to," said Gielata.

The board say the pairs antics are more
detrimental than good, even though Gielata
and Hudac say their remarks are meant to
better the school.

"I don't appreciate the fact that they
mock us continuously," said Douaihy.
"They don't know what we've done."

But Gielata and Hudac believe their
comments are not mocking and will eventu-
ally beneﬁt the system.

"I think that somehow, by persevering,
by agitating every week and being in their
face they Can't be as complacent as they
would be," said Gielata. "They know I'll be
there to remind them that there are still prob-
lems going on." ,

When attending meetings and voicing
their concerns did not work, Gielata and
Hudac did not get discouraged. Instead, they
kept going to the meetings.

"I don't give up," said Hudac. "I'm opti-

Sutherland students’ $25

late fees are d

Melissa Blackwood

Staff Writer

Two Sutherland Hall students who
received refunds from the University and
were later billed for a portion of the money
have since paid their bills.

According to Kate Hodorowicz, she
and suitemate Cherise Clement each paid
the $250 bills.

Hodorowicz said that she had to pay the
bill in order to take part in equestrian club
competitions.

“We were kind of forced into it,”
Hodorowicz said

Prior to the students paying the bill, the
University removed the $25 late fee for not
paying the $250 soon enough, according to
Pitt spokesman Ken Service. .

Service said the late fees were removed
because the billing was not the students’
fault.

Harry Burner, assistant director of hous-
ing, said Sutherland Hall residents who have
accrued late fees and still owe money
because of the housing situation can talk to
him,andhewillmakesurethelatefeesare
removed.

However, the original bill still has to be

rapped by Pitt

According to Bumer, the situation arose
this summer when the University had a
record-high amount of ﬁeshmen enrolling.
One of the solutions to house the extra fresh-
men was to put an additional student . into
each suite room. That decision resulted in a
bill reﬂecting the difference in the amount of

‘money the students who were already slated

for the rooms were charged.

Later, the Housing Department decided
to put students in Sutherland living rooms
instead of in the dorm rooms themselves.
That caused another change in billing.

The students who received a refund and

then a bill for $250 of it back were charged A

because of the changes in the housing situa-
tion as it stood at the time. They received the
bills and refunds according to those changes.

The housing and billing departments
were trying to keep up-to-date with the situ-
ation as it changed They sent the refunds
when they were issued. At that time, they
thought this action would be the last move in
the process.

Later, when thebills were sent for a por-
tion of the refund money, the housing office
made the changes as it felt necessary.

rnistic that one day they will listen to me."

The boards reluctance to listen to them
not only made them try harder, it gave them
the incentive to rim for SGB.

"I don't see anything happening here
that they [SGB] actually do unless they want
to do it in the ﬁrst place," said Hudac.
"You're not going to get them to change their
minds." T

The pairs campaign platfonn, which
can be found on their web page at
www.pitt.edu/~dr’nst19, outlines changing
three things with SGB or the campus: the
relationship between SGB and _ the
Allocations Committee, public visibility, and
the need for gargoyles on the Cathedral of
Leaming.

Even though Gielata and Hudac say
gargoyles would complete the building's
gothic structure, this aim is one reason the
SGB does not take the pair seriously.

Douaihy says her concern with the gar-
goyles is that the Cathedral of Leaming is a
historical structure and that it is very hard to
convince historical societies to make renova-
tions to a historical structure.

‘ Gielata and Hudac want each graduat-
ing class to contribute a gargoyle to the struc-
tureastheclassgiftThistradition,thepair
says, would "bring classes together" and
would "complete an unfulﬁlled structure."

"It's a gothic structure, and it has no gar-
goyles," said Gielata "It's almost ridiculous."

Hudac says he doesn't think they will
have any trouble convincing people that gar-
goyles on the Cathedral is a good thing.

"We will talk to anyone we need to talk
to," said Hudac. "We're very charismatic."

Oneoftheothertvvoairnsoftheircam-
paign is to make themselves available to the
students. They say the current board has not
done anything to let students know it cares.

"I don't think they've made any sincere
effort to advertise themselves," said Gielata.
"It's like a magic trick — one year you see
them, the next year you don "

Gielata and Hudac have already made
themselves public. On Monday, the pair
climbed to the ﬁrst ﬂoor roof of the William
Pitt. Union and yelled the issues of their cam-
paign to students below. Douaihy reacted to
this by calling the police, who escorted
Hudac and Gielata off the roof.

"She helped us get more attention," said
Hudac.

The third goal of their campaign is to
reestablish accountability in SGB.

"You have to be accountable if you are
going to start taking money from the stu-
dents," said Gielata.’ I

Gielata and Hudac plan to continue
attending every SGB meeting and making
their voices heard until their requests are met
or they become part of SGB.

"They need to know that there are peo-
ple out there. watching them," said Hudac.
"They need to know that there are people
who are looking critically at what they are
doing and evaluating and actually thinking,
‘Is this really good?"'

Hudac says he thinks he and Gielata
have a good chance of winning spots on
SGB but is aware that some people don't
take them seriously.

"The main challenge will be convincing '

people they are wrong," said Hudac.

Motley Crue not at fault
for youth at concert

City officials want to press charges against the hard rock
band Motley Crue for showing a pornographic video on a
large screen at the band’s Civic Arena concert last weekend.

Oﬁicials claim there were young children at the concert
and they received many complaints from parents of those
children. _

The whole situation is absolutely preposterous. Children
shouldn’t have been present at a Motley Crue concert in the
ﬁrst place. ‘

It’s no secret that Motley Crue is not a teeny-bopper

band. This isn’t Debbie Gibson we’re talking about here. It’s ,

no Bon Jovi. It’s not even Richard Marx.

Motley Crue’s songs have lyrics like, “For all of my
friends / she goes down.” Their videos have borderline
explicit sexual content If parents were aware of this, and
they let their children go anyway, they have no place com-
plaining. .

If parents didn’t know anything about the band and let
their young children go anyway, then they are clearly irre-
sponsible, and have have absolutely no right to complain.

Parents should be taking care that their children aren’t
growing up too fast — that they have a chance to experience
what innocent youth is like.

Letting children run rampant and go to any concert they
want, without checking into the band’s background, is total-
ly irresponsible. . .

Any parents who found themselves complaining that
their children witnessed a pornographic video at a Motley
Crue concert should be ashamed for allowing it themselves.

But instead of accepting responsibility for raising their
children, some parents would rather not have to make any
personal effort, so they try to place blame on anybody else
they can.

Some poor guy working the video-control console for
the show is going to have criminal and civil charges ﬁled
against him for doing his job. It’s not his fault that children
were there, yet he and anybody else who saw the actual
videotape before it went on screen are going to have to
defend themselves against legal suits because some parents
were too immature and irresponsible to have children in the
ﬁrst place.

How to end relationships painfully

p. r. taylor

columnlst

It’s that time. About six
months after your heart leapt
with (joy?) at the sight of the
Object of Desire, it now leaps
with something else. It’s the
adrenalin rush one gets after one
realizes that one has been‘ doing
the wrong thing with the wrong
person and now wishes heartily
that one hadn’t. Because now
comes the really awkward part
— telling the ex-O of D that, in
fact, you are sorry, you made a
mistakeand please just Go Away.
You hope and pray there will be
no tearful or emotional scenes,
but usually there are.

It’s rare that two people
simultaneously decide to end a
relationship. If they did, these
problems would not exist.
Nobody likes to be dumped, but
on the other hand, being the
dumper is not a pleasant task
either. Nature has us by the short
and curlies, though. From puber-
ty onwards, we all are subject to
the temporary insanity of sexual
attraction. A basic biological
drive — and Darwin told us why.
We are fairly helpless in the face
of this urge to merge; and the
worst aspect of it is that we can-
not distinguish —— in the initial
stages of attraction — between
lust and love.

I am conﬁdent that eventual-
ly neuroscience will produce a
deﬁnitive list of brain chemicals
that mediate this overwhelming
feeling, and quite possibly there
will be a simple home cere-
brospinal-ﬂuid test one can do to
tell the difference. You know -

Pink for Lust only, Blue for Love
only, and Purple if you hit the
jackpot. Religions have come up
with multiple strategies to regu-
late sexual behavior, but reli-
gious rules are not enough of a
reinforcement for most people in
the late 20th century.

What to do when you realize
that nature has once more tricked
you into bed with a stranger who
turns out once again to be Mr. or
Ms. Wrong for you. The realiza-
tion has actually been slowly
sinking in over the past couple of
months, but, still under a hor-
monal spell, you remained hope-
ful that this was a ﬂeeting minor
problem and not a portent of
doom, so you ignored it. Like the
time he told that off-color joke in
front of your friends and you
were embanassed for him. The
way he thought a certain movie

POINT/COUNTERPOINT  
Gun controlisa waste

Government won ’t icontrol  
guns, but we can individually

Alison Novieki

columnist

Since there is an incredible
amount of corruption and dishon-
esty within the entire political
structure of this country, I don’t see
the implementation of any gun-con-
trol law that will ever satisfy the
pro-gun—control activists, such as
myself, anywhere in the near
future.

Although I believe that radical
gun control is a good idea in theo-
ry, I know that it would never hap-
pen. This country and the people
who run it have gone too far into
their own political ideologies and
obsession with money to consider
that it is dangerous and illogical to
allow people to have access to and
own a vast array of firearms that
are readily available.

~ 71 does not exist only

simple: don’t own a gun. The rea-
sons are simple: If you do own a
gun, you are putting yourself in
more danger rather than protecting
and defending yourself and your
loved ones. ‘

Why do I care?

I feel so strongly because a for-
mer boyfriend of mine was shot at
and escaped possible death by‘ a
mere four inches after having an
argument in his cousin’s home.
Although the bullet did not strike
him, his face and chest were
sprayed with shrapnel. Imagine my
feeling of hysteria on the way to the
hospital, before I knew that he was
not hit by the bullet itself.

As if that event was not enough,
during the same month, I attended
two funerals of victims of gunshots.
One was shot in the back of the
head, the other in the back.

No wonder I hate guns. I hate
them in any context. I hate them on
the streets, on the hunting field, an
most of all, in the home. '

When a gun is located in your

home, you are putting yourself and T

your loved ones or roommates in
serious danger.

Pro-gun activists argue that
handguns that are kept in the home

are used for self—protection. That
sounds like a legitimate claim, but
according to the Aug. 15, 1994
issue of U.S. News & World
Report, for every case of gun use
for self-protection, there are 43
instances where guns are used in
suicides, homicides and accidental
deaths. Also, a 6-year study on
home firearms in Seattle showed

that out of 395 deaths, ‘there were

only nine instances of self-defense
but 12 of accidental gunshot deaths,’
41 criminal homicides and 333
firearm suicides.

This means that the dangers of
owning a gun — homicides, sui-
cides, and accidental-gunshot

deaths — far outweigh the “bene-
fit” of owning a gun for self-protec-
tion.

Even if your intentions for
owning a gun are good, accidents
happen. A ~

_ Dr. Arthur Kellerma "

 

Even if you keep it locked up
where you think it won’t be found,
accidents still happen.

In the same U.S News & World
Report article, there is a story about
a 2-year-old boy who found his
father’s gun and accidentally fired
it into the back of his 14-month-old
brother. Unfortunately, accidents
like this one are frequent. Think of
how many times in the past year
you have heard on the news that a
child accidentally killed or wound-
ed another child with a gun.

It is equally disturbing to know
that not only do so many deaths
occur accidentally by guns, but that
one—third of all homicides take
place merely on impulse of anger
(Lancet Magazine, May 29, 1993).

‘Dr. Kellermann’s analysis was that

in a heated dispute, few will con-
sider the legal consequences, and
are too busy reaching for a gun.
The two men I knew are part of that
one-third of homicides. They died
because of anger.

The reasons one has for owning
a gun may be legitimate, but the
consequences are possibly fatal.

Alison‘ Novicki will never own a
handgun because she feels much
safer without one.

of the taxpayers’ money

Dan
Ertman

There is a great evil in this country,
and the evil is ﬁrearms. A large number of
our representatives in Washington have
made it their solemn duty to rid us of this
evil. They site gang violence, random
violence, and accidental violence as rea-

sons that guns should disappear. They-

also claim (very logically, I might add)
that there is absolutely no way anyone in
his or her right mind needs an AK-47 to
hunt rabbits. Elmer Fudd would probably
even agree with that.

A large number of other representa-
tives have made it their solemn duty to
ensme that the guns stay on the streets.
They hold up the Second Amendment to
the Constitution, and loudly proclaim that

it is the right of every red-blooded"

American citizen to bear whatever arms

he so chooses, whether or not the afore-

mentioned arm’ could theoretically ‘t-

erate Texas. These people make n_ '
.‘ Ilx .

‘v

    

 
 

ou can’t stop the guns  you
can’t control the black market. It’s like

trying to place a dam too far upstream.

The river just ﬂoods its way around the
blockade. The more you tighten the
clamps on the legal market for ﬁrearms,
the harder the black market ﬁghts. The
harder the black market ﬁghts, the more
you tighten the clamps, until eventually
the government is spending billions of the
taxpayers’ money, while the black market
is getting millions of the psychopaths’
money every single day. In a country that
can’t control drugs, speeding, or the
actions of Senator Robert Packwood,
why are some so vain as to believe that
we can stop the ﬂow of guns?

I know this is a rather dire and
depressing view. But somehow — after
the umpteenth report of the FBI seizing
ungodly amounts of cocaine, or marijua-
na, or crack, or ﬁrearms, and then walk-
ing around, and having someone come up
to me and say, “You wanna buy sonre
smack?” —— I’ve kind of lost hope in the
government’s stopping the black market
of anything, including guns.

As proof of how powerful a weapon
can be, and how powerless our govern-
ment is to stop them, I’ll begin wiﬂr an
outrageous example: Apache war heli-
copters. According to Harper’s Index
from earlier this year, there are currently
six fully armed Apache military heli-

copters in the hands of private citizens.

This is by no means to say that there
is a black market in these massive
machines — it would be very diﬂicult,
for instance, to ﬁt one in a duffel bag or
the trunk of a Lincoln Continental. It is,
however, to say that the government cur-
rently has absolutely no control over
these machines, or their owners.

The government isn’t even entirely
sure how these private citizens acquired
them. If one of these kind (hopefully!)
individuals were to have an exceptionally
bad day at work, he could do a lot of dam-
age before the government could step in
and take control. If we can’t control the
ﬂow or use of Apache helicopters, which

~ measure roughly seven times the volume

of my dorm room, how can we possibly
expect to stop the ﬂow of, say, 9 mm
handguns, which measure roughly the
same volumetrically as the layer of dis-
gusting, inedible mustard on top of the
bowl in the Towers Cafeteria? ..
I therefore don’t support

n’t.

      
   

   
   

get the guns illegally, which, I suppose, is
in some way showing that we do not sup-
port their actions, but we - cannot stop
them. _

Sure, some people will say, “We
should at least try! ! Doesn’t every little bit
count?”

To this I reply, “If money came to our
government in -an unlimited and inex-
haustible supply, by all means we should.
If we even had a balanced budget, by all
means take any steps necessary to get
even one more gun off the street. But
money is tight here in this country of
ours, and somehow, I’d rather see the 92-
year—old grandmother get that last needed
dose of chemotherapy from Medicaid, or
that father of three get the last unemploy-
ment check he needed to get back on
track, than see our money ﬂushed down a
bottomless pit, with little or no return and
no hope for one in the future.

So until someone comes up with an
effective plan to stop the underworld, I
say we shouldn’t waste our time or our
tax dollars trying to control what seems to
be a force of nature, and we should con-
centiate on improving what we can con-
trol instead. '

Dan Ertman would rather see our tax
dollars spent on policies that are reason-
able and on enforcing laws that are
enforceable. '

  Watch out for
Temple, Part II

Rutgers is the worst team in the
Big East this year.

The Big East is one of the worst
conferences in major college football
this year. .

9 Therefore, Rutgers is one of the
worst teams in major college football
this year.

It obviously doesn’t take a genius

, to figure that one out.

Remember, Temple used to be the
worst team in the Big East year in
and year out, and look who they have
beaten two out of the last three times.

Yes, our own Pittsburgh
Panthers.

Granted, Pittsburgh leads the all-
time Pitt—Rutgers series 12-2 and has
outscored the lowly Scarlet Knights
by a combined score of 427-205.
Still, if our recent loss to Temple
taught us anything, it is that we can-
not afford to look past the winless
warriors from New Brunswick.

The last time Walt Harris’ team
had two weeks to prepare for a con-
ference doormat, the Panthers left
Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia on
the short end of a 17-13 contest
against Temple — the sameTemple
team that has three conference wins
in its history, two of which are at the
expense of the Panthers.

This week, it’s off to New Jersey
for an even sadder situation. On its
way to an 0-7 mark, Rutgers has been
outscored 313-99 by its opponents.

Rutgers has not yet this season
surrendered fewer than 35,points in a
game. 9

Four teams ——- Virginia Tech,
Texas, West Virginia and Syracuse —-
have all tallied 48 or more points.

Pitifully for the Scarlet Knights,

35 of their 99 points came in one.

game, last week’s .37-35 loss at Army.

Rutgers Head Coach Terry Shea
has won only two games in his
tenure. A

On the other hand, Pittsburgh
Head Coach Harris has jump-started
the new-look Pittsburgh program, but
has yet to put it on a level to compete
with top-notch teams week in and
week out.

For the first time in recent mem-
ory, a Panther team has scored more
points (152) than it has given up
(150). -

Terry Murphy catches

Racking up tons of catch-

That’s ' why’ this season
which Murphy has put togeth-

part of Pitt’s surprising success.
He leads the team in touch-
downs, scoring six in six
games. That’s three times as
many as thévnext-closest
Panther (four players are tied
with two touchdowns).

“He’s just a good football
player with talent,” Head
Coach Walt Harris said. “He’s
fun to coach because he just
wants to learn and get better.”

Murphy’s success has
been somewhat of a surprise
for Pitt. Last year at this time,
he was in California hauling in

passes for West Los Angeles

Bye-week work preps Panthers for Rutgers

Shannon Heim

Staff Wrlter a

After the impressive season open-

- ing, Homecoming victories, and a

valiant attempt at State College, the
Pittsburgh Panther football team seemed
ready to tackle the toughest of adver-
saries.

That is, until the team traveled to

Temple and suffered a devastating»

defeat, then followed it up with another
losing effort against Notre 'Dame’s
Fighting Irish two weeks ago. In this
weekend’s contest against O-7 Rutgers,
the Panthers are looking to relive their
early-season successes.

Last week the Panthers had a bye
week, in Big East terms. But according
to Head Coach Walt Harris, it was an
“improvement week.” This team would
not beneﬁt from a week of rest, and
Harris was prepared to use the practice

_ time to his full advantage.

“The number-one thing that we
teach our players is how to playqhard.
We played a game two weeks ago that
did not represent us,” Harris said. “The

team sat down and watched the Notre

Dame game together — this enabled us

to ﬁgure out the missed opportunities
that occurred during that game. This
week in practice, we began to play hard
again.”

Practice was intense, especially for
freshman fullback Tony Thompson.
Thompson will start this week for the
former starting fullback, junior Chris
Schneider, who was injured during the
Fighting Irish contest. Schneider suf-
fered a high ankle sprain in that game
and is out indeﬁnitely. ,

Other Panther players that are out
due to injury include redshirt sophomore
Trey McCray, senior defensive tackle
Frank Moore and senior linebacker
Roderick Humphrey, who has yet to
play this season. McCray, benched with
a knee injury, is out for the season. Both
Moore and Humphrey also have injured
knees and the two are questionable for
this week. -

In addition to the loss of these play-
ers, the Pittsburgh team is also lacking in
depth.

Coach Harris reported that he and

his staff “keep using our players over
and over. Many of our guys will come
off of the ﬁeld for a couple of plays, but
will have to go in at another position.
This tires them out much more quickly.”

But, Hanis added, “We do have a
good attitude and leadership though,
especially from our senior players.”

The Panthers have more to look for-
ward to than attitude and leadership. The
team has also been consistent in many
areas of skill this season. Their game
strengths include pressuring the quarter-
back, fourth-down conversions, success
in the red zone, turnovers, and taking
advantage of turnovers. They rank near
the top of the conference in all of these
categories.

Pittsburgh has sacked every oppos-
ing quarterback at least once this season,

carrying a total of 15 sacks thus far. This

number has already exceeded the
Panthers’ total sacks from last year by
four. Junior linebacker Phil Clarke and
senior linebacker Ernest Coakley lead
the Panther team with four sacks each.

STARTS FRIDAY OCTOBER 24 AT THEATRES EVERYWHERE

Senior Writer, the Targum

The Rutgers Scarlet Knights
have fallen on hard times this sea-
son.

When the Knights dropped a 37-
35 decision to Army last weekend,
they tied the mark for the worst start
by any Rutgers football team. At 0-7,
only the 1901 squad has matched
that mark.

RU has not only been losing this
season, it has been losing big. Prior
to Army, the closest the Scarlet
Knights came to any team was a 35-
21 loss at the hands of Boston
College Sept. 20. RU’s defense has
allowed at least 35 points in each of
the games this year.

Despite the heart—wrenching loss
to the Cadets, Rutgers has a renewed
sense of confidence and vigor.

“I think we found a quarterback
today and for tomorrow,” Rutgers
Head Coach Terry Shea said follow-
ing the Army game.

The quarterback in question is
true freshman Mike McMahon.

McMahon, a Wexford, PA native,
made his first collegiate start against
Army and threw for 386 yards and
one touchdown. He also ran for 40
yards and a TD. McMahon’s perfor-
mance in the air was the second best
single—game performance in school
history and the best since 1988.

“I thought we opened it up
[against Army],” McMahon said. “I

felt like we were in a rhythm all
day.” .
But rather than dwell on an indi-
vidual performance, the Knights
have been concentrating this week
on getting on the winning side of the
ledger. For a defense ranked last in
the Big East in every category, it will
require a total team effort.

“What I keep stressing is if we
can be consistent and do the right
thing, we would have a good chance
of winning,” said defensive coordi-
nator Rod Sharpless.

To RU’s benefit is the style of
offense the Panthers run. The Scarlet
Knights have faced a tailback—orient—
ed squad three times this year.

While they had limited success
in those games, Sharpless feels his
defense has adjusted.

But Sharpless has his players on
alert for the rest of Pittsburgh’s
offense, not just Dwayne Schulters.

“The ironic thing about Pitt is
they pass more than everyone
thinks,” Sharpless said. “They’ve got
a quarterback who runs the offense
well and a game plan where they
pass maybe 60 percent of the time.”

As far as Shea is concerned, the
key is to stay with tackles and get off
blocks.

“At times, we’ve been strong

ference play.

Early in the year, Pittsburgh was
filled with bowl anticipation, but a
trip to Temple and a special—teams
debacle against Notre Dame helped
cure the temporary insanity.

Now Pittsburgh has to worry
about keeping its head above water
for the rest of the year.

- Rutgers should be a win.

It should be a blowout.

The Panthers need to pick up
some momentum against the Knights
as well as Boston College before they
face a wicked trio to close out the
season: Syracuse, Virginia Tech and
West Virginia.

A better than .500 team isn’t an
impossibility, but it has to start this
weekend. .

Two road wins would do wonders
for the morale of the team as well as
of the fans, who have been dealt two
consecutive blows thanks to the sur-
prising Owls and the overrated
Fighting Irish. °

FROM PAGE 10

If Pittsburgh can return home
Nov. 15 to face Syracuse at 5-3 rather
than 4-4 or, heaven forbid, 3-5, it will
make a world of difference.

Interest will return to a team that
has a bright future.

All of those people who were
forced to buy a Syracuse ticket with
the Notre Dame package may actual~
ly fill Pitt Stadium’s seats on that
blustery November afternoon.

We have to hope for the best.

A bowl bid isn’t totally out of the
question. but the Panthers will need
to play error-free football and also
get some help from other teams in the
Big East to knock off some of the
conference leaders.

Keep in mind that the fourth-
place team in the Big East with at

_least six wins is guaranteed a bowl

bid.
Stranger things have happened.

News and sees Pitt 31, Rutgers I3.

Thursday, 23 October 1997

We’ve hit a lull in the schedule.
For the past few weeks, there have been a
bunch of games matching two Top—25
teams. This week, there are just two. It’s
kind of appropriate to happen this week.
The matchups are pretty lousy nationwide,
and Pitt’s is one of the worst.

Pitt at Rutgers (+12 1/2)

How’s this for mediocrity? Pitt
has a record of 3-3, 1-1 in the Big East.
The Panthers are outscoring opponents
152-150 this season. It doesn’t get more
average than that. Average, however, is
plenty good enough to beat Rutgers into
the next county. Exactly how bad are the
Scarlet Knights? Before last week’s two-
point loss at Army, the closest Rutgers had
come to winning this season was a 36-7
loss at Navy. Maybe if the Knights played

_ against Air Force next, they’d have a

chance. Now, I know what you’re think-
ing: The last time Pitt had a week off
before playing a lousy team, the Panthers
lost to Temple. Walt Harris won’t let that
kind of performance occur again. Besides,
if you thought Temple was bad, you won’t
believe how bad Rutgers is.

Moak's Best Bet isCrimson-colored in wek of mismatches

Unlike Pitt, however, all Missouri does is
run‘ the ball on offense. Missouri doesn’t
even do that especially well, either.’ The
Tigers will do it even less well playing
against the Cowboys, who have the third-
best rushing defense in the country.
Oklahoma State 37, Missouri 6

Michigan at Michigan State (+2 1/2)

It was only a matter of time
before the Spartans were exposed. Their
early-season schedule was weaker than
Popeye before he had his spinach. Unlike
Popeye, the Spartans won’t be strong ‘til
the ﬁnish of this season. In the next three
weeks, they play Michigan, Ohio State,
and Purdue. Those games will knock the
Spartans out of the Top 25 for sure, and
none of those teams will be needing last-
second ﬁeld-goal blocks to win like
Northwestern did last week. 1

lot like a sandlot team — Timmy the quar-
terback gets the team in a huddle and says
“everyone go long.” That doesn’t usually
work in organized football, but it’s made
Kentucky fairly successful this year. The
Bulldogs are not your run—of—the-mill orga-
nized football team; they are the No. 16
team in the country, and while they-are
probably not among the nation’s truly elite
teams, they are good enough to ground
Trrn Couch and the Wildcats.

Georgia 37, Kentucky 17

Colorado at Texas (+4)

Oh, woe is the Big 12. These two
teams were supposed to be two of the con-
ference’s big-time bowl representatives.
Some people even picked Colorado to win
the national championship. At this point, it
seems like those might be the same people
who see Elvis in rural supermarkets. No,
the Buffaloes won’t be winning any cham-
pionships this season, but at least their loss-
es so far have oorrre against formidable
teams. Texas just barely beat Rice and lost
to Missouri already this year.

Colorado 24, Texas 10

Virginia Tech (+1) at West Virginia
VVrth the loss of quarterback Jim
Druckenrniller, a lot of people thought that
Virginia Tech’s offense would take a nose-
dive this year. It tums.out thatAl Clark is
an adequate replacement. Granted, all he

the way, but he’s managed to keep his team
at the top of the Big East. Until Saturday,
anyway. Oxendine is a good back, but if
this game turns into a battle of running
backs, it’s over before it begins. West

This week’s Best Bet:
Alabama at Mississippi (+1)

Flash back to one week ago
today: LSU was coming off what could
probably be called one of the biggest
games in school history, a win over top-
ranked Florida. The Tigers, justiﬁably,
spent a lot of time celebrating. It was
Mississippi’s good fortune to be next on
LSU’s schedule. Naturally, Mississippi,
despite having received a grand total of \
zero points in the week’s Top-25 voting,
won ﬂrat game. Even Rutgers might have
been able to beat LSU last week. Yet on
the “strength” of last week’s win, .
Mississippi vaulted all the way past “others
receiving votes” and into the No. 25 slot
this week. Alabama, who should be getting
really desperate for a win by now, will
bring the Rebels back down to earth.

“When I ﬁrst met Coach

Murphy explained. “I just felt at home

bid. But if that’s going to happen, the
Panthers need to win at least three of their
ﬁve remaining games.

Included in that stretch are some
very tough games, and the Panthers will
be counting on Murphy’s olfensive spark
to catapult them into the postseason.

But Pitt needs to beat Rutgers on
Saturday before it even thinks about the
rest of the season. The Panthers learned
their lesson about underestimating a less-
er opponent earlier this
year when they lost on
the road to Temple.

legitimate deep threat.

Aside from his six touchdowns, he also is
tied with Jake Hoﬁart for the team lead in
receptions (24), and leads the squad in
receiving yardage (383), yards per catch
(16.0), and receiving yards per game
(63.8).

“I believe in myself, and I work
hard,” Murphy said. “I didn’t expect the
success I’m having, but I’m not sur-
prised.”

Despite two straight losses, Pitt still
has an excellent shot at capturing a bowl

Then, late in the game,
Pitt was trailing by seven, but the Panthers
intercepted a pass and brought the ball
back deep into Temple territory.

That’s the part of the ﬁeld where
Murphy—the-touchdown-machine excels.
But he watched helplessly from the side-
lines as his teammates failed to score a
touchdown and lost the game 17-13.

Murphy’s knee is fully healed, and
facing a Rutgers team that has been
outscored 276-64 this season is a touch-
down machine’s heaven.

has also greatly helped Pittsburgh this
year. The Panthers lead the Big East in
this category, having converted 75 per-
cent of their fourth—down attempts.

The red zone this year has been vis-
ited by the Panther offense 24 times, and
Pittsburgh has scored in 19 of those

' opportunities. They have scored 15
touchdowns and four field goals when
inside the 20-yard line.

The Panthers rank 18th in the coun-
try in turnover margin with a margin of
plus-‘six. So far, they have recorded 14
turnovers: eight interceptions and ‘six
recovered fumbles. Of these turnovers,
the Panthers have converted nine into
scores: seven touchdowns and two ﬁeld
goals.

A team with this many accomplish-
ments requires a strong lineup on both
the offensive and defensive sides of the
ball.

The starting offensive lineup for
Pittsburgh will include many of the
team’s seasoned veterans. Rutgers’
defense will face senior safety Jake
Hoffart, left guard John Marzoch, quar-
terback Pete Gonzalez, and fullback
Dwayne Schulters, who have all started
every game this season.

The offense will also contain senior
left tackle Tony Orlandini, senior right
guard Reggie Thomas, junior wide
receiver Terry Murphy, redshirt sopho-
more Ethan Weidle at right tackle, and
freshman fullback Thompson, spelling

the injured Schneider.

This offense has proven very effec-
tive for the Panthers this season. In their
victory against Miami, the Pitt offense
combined for three touchdowns, all initi-
ated by Gonzalez. The senior quarter-
back rushed l2 yardsfor one score and
completed passes for the other two.

He has been less productive recently,
though, throwing just one touchdown in
each of the last two games.

The Pittsburgh starting defense is the
same lineup for the third consecutive
game. Look for senior outside lineback-
ers Coakley and Eric Kasperowicz,
strong safety Curtis McGhee and free
safety John Jenkins to once again head
the Panther Mad Dog scheme.

Also returning to the defensive start-
ing position are juniors right tackle
Kenny Pegram, right end Marlin Young,
middle linebacker Phil Clarke and cor-
nerback Tray Crayton, sophomores cor-
nerback Hank Poteat and left end Julian
Graham, and freshman J eff McCurley at
left tackle.

The Pittsburgh Panthers’ starting
lines have had two weeks to prepare for
the upcoming battle. Players on both
sides of the ball practiced hard this week
and should be strong coming in to this
game.

In 1996, the last time that these two
teams met, Pitt defeated the Scarlet
Knights by a ﬁnal score of 24-9. Overall,
in the 14 game series, Pittsburgh domi-
nated the record with 12 wins and only
two losses. The Panthers have been vic-
torious in the past seven consecutive con-
