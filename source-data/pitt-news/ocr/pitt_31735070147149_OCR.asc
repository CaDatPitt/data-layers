It’s not a dodgeball tournament
until someone strips to his under-
wear. At least that was the strategy
for Team We’re Here Because We
Hate Frats, or Frats for short.
Competing in nothing more
than compression shorts and
shirts, Frats was the team to beat
when the fourth annual Save Your
Balls Dodgeball Tournament last
night. The event was organized by
Pitt’s chapter of Colleges Against
Cancer. CAC organizes events

1 throughout the year on campus

to raise awareness .and funds for

' cancer research.

“It’s aerodynamic,” Frats
member John Bobak said of the
revealing uniform choice. “Ifyou’re
lighter, you move faster.”

1 But the clingy fabric offered
more beneﬁts than agility.

“They look intense,” said Da-
vid Linz, a member of two—time
tournament champions Team
Delta Sigma Pi. Linz said Frats,
composed of muscular ROTC stu-
dents, seemed to be the toughest
obstacle impeding Delta Sigma’s
path to the three—peat.

The event’s organizer, senior
Rachel Strittmatter, said that the
dodgeball tournament is one of
CAC’s most popular events. V

“The tournament is something
people look forward to and ask us

uring dodgeball ee

about,” Strittmatter said, adding
that one great aspect of the tourna-
ment is its ability to bring groups
from all across campus together

for a charitable cause. The night. ‘

raised $420 for the American Can-
cer Society.

This year’s tournament marked
the largest participation in its four
year, with more than 100 people
gathered in the Belleﬁeld Hall
gym 4 *

Although the Frats team
brought spandex and intimida-
tion, it wasn’t enough to nab the
gold trophy and pizza party. That
prize went to Team USA, a group of
relative strangers, who prevailed
over the 14 teams who participated
in the tournament.

The fourth annual Save Your Balls Dodgeball Tournament attracted 14 teams who competed in Belleﬁeld Hall last night.

_ “Most of us didn’t really know
each other before this month,”

Team USA member Laura Straub _

said. She said the team members
came together when they were in-
troduced by mutual friends.

After an hour of dodging, duck-
ing, dipping, diving and dodg-
ing, Team USA stood victorious.
They shared the prize of a pizza
party at center court with runner-
ups Team Sex Panthers.

There was an air of intensity in
the gym throughout the tourna-
ment. The basketball court was
packed as participants acted as
both competitors and spectators.‘

documents. A

Pitt filed the suit in 2004

‘The defendants engaged in
a joint partnership to install

A sea of students dressed in gold

von Woodall grabbed a loose ball
on the court during Wednesday’s
South Florida game.

One of the more brazen at-
tempts to distract the Pitt bas-
ketball team’s opponent .— South
Florida was this week’s victim -—

ers, students in the Oakland Zoo

gan sends Facebook messages and
distributes papers before every
game. He also exerts some form
of control over the crowd with
his whiteboard. During games, he
writes speciﬁc cheers for the fans,
who enthusiastically comply.

Hogan —— who was sitting in
the first row across from half
court —— said he goes to every
home game and makes it to as
many away games as he can.

Since its inception nearly a
decade ago, the Oakland Zoo has
doggedly bolstered fans and in-
timidated opposing teams. Only
six years after the Zoo’s birth,
Sports Illustrated crowned Pitt
as the toughest place to play in
college basketball.

Comprised of student fans who
dress up in the signature look of
the Zoo — a gold T-shirt -—~ the
Oakland Zoo is known for its
various gimmicks and ploys to
distract opposing teams.

The screams and antics of the
Zoo do more than just distract
the opponents. In a press con-
ference yesterday, guard Travon

Woodall said that the Zoo gave the -

team a boost in the South Florida
game.

“They deﬁnitely came out with
a lot of energy, and gave us _a boost
of energy when we had that little
lull in the second half, but they
deﬁnitely gave us that boost of
energy,” he said. ‘

Dr. ToddM. Kays, sports and

I performance psychologist and

president and founder of Ath-
letic Mind Institute in Ohio," said
there is deﬁnitely a home-court
advantage.

“If you hit a rough spot in the
game, you have the‘crowd’s sup-
port and you feel it puts you in a
better mental state to perform
better,” Kays said. “The crowd
can provide adrenaline and keep
players focused.”

The crowd doesn’t just encour-
age its team, it also distracts the
opponent, he added.

“The crowd can serve as a

or taunting as two teams took center stage
for ﬁve-minute dodgeball battles.

The tournament was structured in a dou-

ble-elimination format with two brackets. P

If a team lost a match, it was moved to the
losers bracket.
At the end of three rounds, the winner

' from the winners bracket, Team USA, com-

peted against the winner from the losers
bracket, the Sex‘ Panthers.

Frats blamed its loss in part on the tour-
nament rules. The rules stipulated that two
teams of six would meet on the Belleﬁeld
basketball court to throwvit out.

Members of Frats were disappointed that
teams could not throw from just behind

the center court line, like in “professional
volleyball.”
“I want it down, gritty and raw,” Bobak

‘said.

The tournament was heavy on the tes-
tosterone, with male ‘competitors far out-
numbering the women.

Amber Malloy of Team Blue Balls was a
little apprehensive when she found herself
in the line of an athletic man’s ﬁre.

“It’s intimidating playing against guys,”
she said. .

But Team USA’s Straub saw her gender
as an advantage in the matches.

“All the guys overlook the girls,” she said.
“It’s kinda like I’m a secret weapon.” I

when that happens, performance will au-
tomatically drop,” Kays said.

How large a role the Oakland Zoo played . ‘

in South Florida’s loss is indeterminable,
but the Zoo will be back with its papers and
cheers next Thursday when Pitt takes on

‘ West Virginia.
When the announcer shouts, “Panther.

fans, arrrrrrrre you ready?” Pitt fans re-
spond with a deafening combination of
yells and stomps.
Game cheers reach a high when the ac-
tual game starts. ‘
“GARRRYYYY!” students shouted as
Gary McGhee jumped in the air during the
tip-off, stretching his almost—7-foot frame
to grasp the ball before South Florida’s
forward Ron Anderson, Jr. _
“GARY HUNGRY!” screamed a couple of
students, who cupped their hands to their
faces to amplify the cheer. V
Raucous voices weren’t the only sounds

to ﬁll the Pete. Throughout the game, the
pep band entertained the Zoo with songs
like BonJovi’s “Living on a Prayer.”

Sousaphone player Tope Abegunde is _

often present for some of the biggest mo-
ments in Pitt basketball, and it didn’t take
him long to recall his favorite moment. _

“When Ronald Ramon shot that 3-point-
er against WVU, in that huge upset” the
senior said almost instantly,'remembering
the game in 2008. “I never saw the Zoo go
more crazier.”

And the cheers aren’t just beneﬁcial to
the basketball team. Kays said some of the

. psychological beneﬁts of attending games

for fans include getting a break from the
everyday grind, and spending time with

5 friends: “Sports are wonderful for people

because they allow us to be a part of some-
thing bigger, and be energized and excited
among other emotions, in the conﬁnes of
a couple hours,” Kays said. ‘

Hogan agrees. “I missed a lot of classes,
but I have no regrets,” he said. I

Wasted woes

Given the preponder-
ance of Super Bowl beer
commercials and under-
age alcohol citations that
seem to typify American
society, we like to con-

- sider ourselves among the
world’s most booze—loving
peoples. But our undaunted

' self—praise mightjust be too
wishful. According to a re-
port by the World Health
Organization, Europeans
are putting away more spir-
its than we are. The report
says that whereas Russians
consume oniaverage 12.5 li-
ters ofpure alcohol per year
and Moldovans down 18,
Americans are only manag-
ing a mere 9.4. In his State
of the Union address last
month, President Barack
Obama spoke of a “Sput-
nik moment” to describe
this moment in American
history. We agree. Not to
mention that we’re getting
used to the sound of “Bud
Light Sputnik.”

Personal space

There are some activities
that should be performed
alone. Common examples
include playing solitaire,
taking entrance exams and
standing in a voting booth.
But for someone as com-
fortable in the public eye
as a weatherman, perhaps
those propriety lines could
get hazy. According to one
story out of San Diego, it
seems like that might have
happened to one unlucky
meteorologist. The San Di-
ego Union-Tribune reports
that longtime —— though re-
cently resigned —— KUSI-
TV weatherman Joe Lizura
pleaded guilty ‘last week to

‘ “engaging in lewd conduct

in public.” The case refers
to an event in October, when
a San Diego State Universi-
ty student reportedly told
police that she saw Lizura

masturbating while looking

at her through a window.
Whatever actually hap-
pened, the weather report
that October day in Califor-
nia was cloudy with a slight
chance of showers.’

Super-‘incise’ me, exécu-
teur

The human head is a
masterpiece of evolution-
ary and physical perfec-
tion. Surely, no animal can
manipulate its face as me-
ticulously as a personcan,
but the real wonder is in
what the head houses: the
human brain, the organ
responsible for the moon
landing, the atom bomb and
the stock market. Consid-
ering the power residing
within the sapiens skull,
no wonder that, for thou-

sands of years, disgruntled '

citizens have reaped so
much pleasure out of cut-
ting their corrupted lead-
ers’ heads off. Guillotine-
like devices have separated
many unfortunate heads
in history, but it’s rare to
find a similar fate befalling
American fast-food icons.
According to AOL News,
a group of Finnish animal
rights activists with the
so-called Food Liberation
Army kidnapped and be-
headed a Ronald McDonald
sculpture, which they stole
from a McDonald’s in Hel-
sinki. We can sympathize
with the activists insofar as
recognizing Ronald’s too-
creepy—to-be-kid-friendly
smile, but seriously, why so
much hate on redheads?

Finding rich people W

you —- the key to happiness

Oliver Bateman
Columnist

 
  

On the reality show “Secret Mil-
lionaire,” the rich go undercover
in deprived neighborhoods to
locate worthy poor people upon
whom they can bestow their bless-
ings as well as. a few thousand
dollars of spending money. This
reminded us of that one ancient
myth in which an old man and
woman believe they’re letting a
beggar stay in their house, only
to discover that the guest is a god
in disguise. The more we thought
about this, the more we realized
how apt the connection was —— the
rich are like gods who walk among
us. Given that these godlike rich
form the backbone of our society,
we’ve decided to prepare a help-
ful FAQ list that will shed light on
their glamorous and mysterious
lifestyles. -
What foods do the rich eat?

The rich wouldn’t dream of
consuming potatolchips or Coke
— not even if the former are or-
ganic and the latter is made from
hand-harvested sugarcane. Sty-
rofoam cups and plastic utensils
never brush against the collagen-
injected lips of the rich. The rich
can’t believe that anyone would
condescend to purchase a $5 piz-
za. Discount coupons are never
clipped by the rich. The rich refuse
2-for-1 specials and won’t have
anything to do with Pabst Blue
Ribbon beer, even in an ironic way.
The rich feed caviar — made from
the endangered beluga sturgeon
—— to their genetically engineered
toy dogs. The rich are always going
to dinner parties and beneﬁt galas
in support of distressed places.‘
The rich wouldn’t dream of eating
shellﬁsh after Labor Day.

What kind of jobs do the rich
have?’ »

For the rich, time is money. The
rich couldn’t stop wheeling and

dealing if they tried. The rich are
going short on hog futures and
making credit-default swaps.
The rich play the market the way
the poor play the slots at casinos
owned by the rich. The rich have
enough clout to break the Chinese
yuan. The rich keep getting richer,
but that’s how it has to work when
you’ve got a son at Oxford and a
daughter at Princeton. The inter-
est you pay to your credit card
company subsidizes the hobbies
enjoyed by the rich. However, the
rich contend that the heavy taxes
they pay have stiﬂed their creativ-
ity, innovation and ability to pur-
chase luxury condominiums near
sunny beaches. The rich have cor-

ner offices in skyscrapers named ,

after their grandparents.

How should you behave around
the rich?

Anyone who has watched “Se-
cret Millionaire” knows that the

rich have warm heartsand deep

THAT'S WHAT sue SAID

 

Yinzers closer than you’d think

Caitlyn Christensen
Columnist

I can’t decide if I’m getting old or
if there is something going on in
Pittsburgh. Call it six degrees of
Kevin Bacon or Whatever. Per-
haps it’s because I came to a large
school from a small town and
expected freshman anonymity

' to continue until my graduation

day, but more and more here, I
feel like I have some connection
to pretty much everybody.

It might be classes and general
interests that keep me rotating
through the same circles. Or it
might be that I’ve never taken
time off to study abroad. I don’t
know, but the superstitious part
of me makes me inclined to think
it’s something more than hap-
penstance.

Here’s my‘best example: One
of my close friends dated a girl
last year whose, roommate — not
from my town —— was sweethearts
with a guy from my high school
class. Sure, Pitt is a big school. I
get why it’s probably not earth-
shattering,-but come on. Things
like this keep cropping up, and
they consistently throw my head
through a loop. . ‘ .

The “six degrees” phenom
enon originates from experi-
ments started by-mathematician
Manfred Kochen and political
scientist Ithiel de Sola Pool at
the University of Paris in the
1950s and continued by Stanley
Milgram at Harvard in the late
1960s. Milgram chose individu-
als in Nebraska and Kansas to
forward a chain of letters to an
individual on the other side of
the country, in Massachusetts. If
the participant did not know the
target personally, they were told

to forward the package to some-
one they thought likely to know
the target. The average chain link
was, as you might have guessed,
six people.

Ther_e were problems with the
study, suggesting that the people
weren’t necessarily connected
randomly. Participants were re-
cruited through advertisements
specifying people who considered
themselves “well-connected.”
The social network approached
homogeneity, so connections
were expected. ‘

Anyway, I think the important
thing to realize here is that, .no
matter the outcome of the experi-
ments, they came about because
people noticed that something
freaky was going on. But what
I’m noticing in Pittsburgh is even
freakier — it’s like Milgram’s six
degrees are reduced to two.

Of course, Faceb.ook makes
it easier to recognize the chain

links in _social networking, but .

some things still reverberate with
a sense of the “Twilight Zone.”
Take my friend, who moved right
before entering high school but
ended up coming to Pitt and dat-
ing a guy who went to the high
school that she would have grad-
uated from. The guy, it should be
noted, is my close friend from my
example above. I became friends
with both separately, semesters
apart, before they were dating.
They met without me introduc-
ing them.

I thought that once I turned 21,
I’d ﬁnd" out that I was wrong and
didn’t have some strange connec-
tion to everyone in Pittsburgh.
But a typical night out produces

encounters with former floor-

mates, and former co-workers’
philosophy professors.

I recognize the fact that Pitts-
burgh isn’t that big, and maybe
all of this boils down to simple
rules of proximity. Or, like Mil-
gram’s experiment suggested,
maybe I just travel in a homog-
enous crowd that occupies the
same spaces and establishes the
same kind of relationships. Like
attracts like.

But chances are, you’ve re-
alized these little Pittsburgh
connections too. Milgram’s ex-

. perimentled. to subsequent in-

vestigations and analysis. Among
them was Malcolm Gladwell’s
book, “Tipping Point,” detail-
ing how sociological changes
spread. Gladwell’s book intro-
duced the “Law of the Few,” the
theory that social change — he
calls instances of change “epi—
demics” + depends on people
with particular, rare sets of gifts V
to spread them. These people
comein three forms: connectors
(people with a knack for making a
lot of friends and acquaintances),
mavens (people in tune with new

, information) and salesmen (the

persuaders). These hubs medi-
ate the connections between
otherwise weakly connected in-

. dividuals.

Maybe I’m being romantic
here, but part of me is inclined to
think that Pittsburgh might just
be a city with a high proportion
of those gifted hubs, making it
easier to form connections here.
In the past years our little city has
seen two trips to the Super Bowl
and avG—20 conference, each in
consecutive years. It’s all theory,
and I don’t have proof, but there
might just" be something special
going on in this town.

pockets. Since they have security
guards and attack dogs to pro-
tect them, never approach the
rich from behind. The rich reside
in gated communities. The rich
aren’t used to touching callouses,
so remember to use moisturizer ‘
before shaking their hands. If the
rich seem to have thin skins, it’s

. because they’re used to command-

ing total obedience from their
subordinates. The rich in America
aren’t royalty, but they probably
wouldn’t mind if you curtsied or.
perhaps even genuﬂected when
you meet them. The rich expect
nothing but the best. , .

What do the rich do for fun?

The rich purchase and trade
sports teams.’ When the mood
strikes, the rich jet off to exotic
locales to mingle with their rich
friends. The rich don’t watch tele-
vision or read the newspapers, be-
cause they’re immune to the vicis-
situdes of life. Humor is lost on the
rich, who can never ﬁgure out why
comedians are always satirizing
them. The rich know how to sail
yachts and ride horses. They can’t
tell good things from bad because
they’ve' never experienced the bad.
The rich are just like us, except for
their special privileges and unique
opportunities.

How can you become rich?

I

This is a very good question,
but the rich have been rich for so
long that they» can’t remember
how they got rich. That hasn’t
stopped some of the rich from
writing get—rich-quick books,
though. The only people who get
rich from these books are the rich.
If you ask the rich, they’ll tell you
it takes money to make money.
One good way to make money is to
befriend one of the rich after he or
she has gone undercover to mingle
with the poor. Another way is to
invent an exciting new product
that the rich can market to people
who aren’t rich. If all else fails, the
rich are accepting applications for
nannies, butlers and maids.

As you can see, the rich are a
special class. If “Secret Million-
aire” is any indication, it might
even be possible to meet the rich._
We’ve never met them, but our
hopes remain high. We want the
rich to deem us worthy of their
priceless love.

For the dedicated, DJing is a ull

-time job

Isaac Goldszer (right), aka D] B Tips, and a colleague practice turntables. For Goldszer, being a successful D] means balancing the business and creative aspects of the profession.

Jonathan Shakesprere
For The Pitt News

Want to become the next Deadmaus?
Dream of making your own “Robot
Rock’? Although it’s not easy to be
a D] in local clubs, with the right
mindset it’s far from impossible.

Three successful Pittsburgh Djs —
' .— DJ Allbe, D] B Tips and DJ Nugget

— stressed the importance ofbeing
an avid listener before aspiring D_]s
start on their own paths. Becom-
ing a star won’t happen overnight,
they said, but with an earnest artistic
interest, the status and the lifestyle
will follow.

A smartﬁrst step is going out and
supporting local artists and actively
noticing their speciﬁc use of genre
and presentation, said Isaac Gold-
szer — who, as D] B Tips, entertains
crowds in the Rex Theater, Shadow
Lounge and other venues.

“Support what’s already going
on,” Goldszer said. “Cutups and

Keeb$ [Lazercrunk] at the Brillo-
box are bringing out a consistent
crowd every Thursday  and they’re
not going to be ignored for their ef-
forts.”

Paul Matthews, aka DJ Allbe, said
the inﬂuences of one’s environment
and how a taste in music develops
play important roles in stylistic
growth.

“A few friends shared some great
DJ mixes with me that I listened to

all the time,” Matthews said. “I was

curious about Djing and eventually
just decided to give it a try. It was so
much fun that I just started mixing
all the time, trying to put together
different styles and genres and just
experiment with it.

When DJs do attain prominence,
they must not forget their roots in
the process, Adam Kulik —— known
in Pittsburgh as D] Nugget — said.

“Every weekend I would tape the
Djs do their live mix shows on Friday

and Saturday nights, then listen to

them in my Walkman on my way to

school all week,” Kulik said.

As far as technology is con-
cerned, the higher the sound qual-
ity, the better. - »

“Get your music straight: high

quality audio — 128 kbps-320 kbps‘

—— is a must,” Goldszer said.

In the same vein, Matthews
instructed beginners to “Buy your
own music! If going the mp3 route,
always make sure it’s 320 kbps  It
will make you consciously decide
whether or not each song you buy
will be one that you could see your-
self playing for a crow .”

But Kulik also acknowledged the
diﬁiculty — despite lower prices for
the necessary software and equip-
ment — in creating a marketable
product. But whatever tools one
starts out with, Kulik said, “Take
as many gigs as possible when you

. start. It 'doesn’t matter if you just

want to be a club D]. Nothing pre-
pares you better for the club than
having real world experience play-
ing different even .”

All three Djs characterize their
encounters with venues as hit or
miss, citing the strength of their
relationships. with promoters and
establishment owners as the deﬁni-
tive factor in how and where you
perform. This calls attention to the
underlying skill any prospective DJ
must have in spades: the ability to

, market yourself and handle the busi-

ness aspect of the profession.

“Make sure you’re ready to com-
mit to this lifestyle. It’s not as glam-
orous as it may look sometimes, and
it’s not for everyone,” Matthews
said. . »

Goldszer said Djs must forge a
strong connection between the pri-
vate and public aspects of making a
mark in a growing culture. After all,
“to be a D] means youhave to be a
businessman as well.”

Ultimately, juggling work and
play deﬁnes a DJ’s lifestyle. You
must know when to listen to new
music, beatmatch orwork with your
turntables and when to ﬁnish that

 . ...s.-..<:«a:-‘.-,-~<‘:'

 

paper due the next day or work an
overtime shift.

“I work a 9-to-5 job and go to
classes at night, so some weeks I’m
lucky just to get a‘ chance to touch
my tumtables, letalone prepare to
play a gig. But I listen to music sev-
eral hours a day, and_I know what

makes me want to dance,” Matthews I

said. 4

Despite such daily constraints,
the Djs said satisfaction rests in that
one moment when the crowd cheers

’ and chants your name — that one

night when everything just seems
to click. —
“Being able to read your crowd is

V one of the most important aspects of

Djing. That combined with having a
true love for music is what sets D_]s
apart,” Kulik said.

On the attraction of this lifestyle
-— this “culture” and network of re-
lationships '—' Goldszer added: “Per—
sonal connections are the reason

This week, on the first day of my

‘how mu'ch'I’d bel.d'oing,' and I if

knew whattime I was_ supposed

came when I asked my super-

told me that jeans and sneakers

I grew up believing there
was only one way to dress for

the portrayal of office environ-

Staﬂ” Writer

More Amor

Thanks?

Rocks Like: The Ready Set, The
Maine, The Rocket Summer

Grade: C+
More Amor might mean “more
love,” but as the band’s latest
album Thanks? suggests, what
it really needs is more time to
figure itself out. 

Straight from ‘Las Vegas,
More Amor is a tiny electronic
duo. Its latest album — or Efmix—
tape,” as itlbills itself —‘ is an
attempt to lure in a wide swath
of in_die—rock fans. Unfortu-
nately, the result is a bemusing
stalemate. ,

The mixtape has potential
— or at least,‘ it had potential
before More Amor decided to
try appealing. to every musical

genre. This is, as you might have
guessed, not a very cohesive al-
bum, as it jumps quickly from
beachy pop to the darker and
more forceful “Miss Martyr”
to a basement-party themed
“Sloppy Little Kisses,” an elec-
tronic bit about fending off un-
wanted interactions with drunk
girls at parties.

In addi‘tiont‘o‘it"s disorient-
ing variety of styles, the album’
is also needlessly alarming: The
bridge of “Miss Martyr” is lit-

erally the duo yelling to a dub- ,

step loop in the background. Itlzs
clear that these two don’t have
a firm grasp on exactlywhlat
kind of band they want to be
— catering to as many fans as
possible, they merely confuse
the listener. I .
It’s best for a newcomer to“

approach this mixtape, which is

MEN’S BASKETBALL

 

Gibbs will return against St. John’s

Nate Barnes
For The_Pitt News

During Ashton Gibbs’ absence, the
Pitt men’s basketball team gravitat-
ed its focus away from the 3-point
line, making only four shots beyond
the arc in three games.

On Saturday, Gibbs, Pitt’s lead-
ing scorer and best 3-point shooter,
will return to the ﬂoor after miss-

‘rng time with a partial MCL tear in
his left knee’. The No. 4 Panthers
(24—2, 12-1 Big East) will take on St.
John’s (16-9, 8-5 Big East) in Square
Garden at noon.

“It was tough being on the
bench,” Gibbs said. “I was prob-
ably the happiest man in the world
when they gave me the OK to play.
I’m deﬁnitely happy to be back on
the court.”

Pitt guard Travon Woodall, who
started in place of Gibbs at point
guard, said it’ll help the team to
have another scorer on the ﬂoor.
He added that head coach Jamie
Dixon effectively prepared the
team to play without Gibbs and
the Panthers performed like an
experienced squad in picking up
three wins.

“[Dixon] shows us that we’re a

veteran group and prepares us well
enough to go out there and play our
game,” Woodall said. “Obviously,
_our scoring kind of went down,
but we got to step up on defense
and do a lot more of the things we
didn’t when we had Ashton in the
line-up.”

Gibbs said his return date was
the doctor’s decision and that his

dtnee is close to 100 percent recov-
ered. -

Although Gibbs will deﬁnitely
play against the Red Storm, it’s un-
known whether he’ll start or come
off the bench.

£1 Pitt is leading the conference by
two games over Notre Dame, and
a win in Madison Square Garden
could very well solidify that spot
with only four games remaining on
the schedule.

But St.]ohn’s will be no easy task,

‘as the Red Storm have proven with
wins over No. 9 Georgetown, No. 8
Notre Dame, No. 5 Duke and No. 13
Connecticut. At the same time, the

Red Storm suffered puzzling losses
to St. Bonaventure and Fordham.

“They’ve been playing good
recently,” Gibbs said. “I think the
good team is going to show up, es-
pecially because they’re playing at
home. It’s a great atmosphere.”

St. John’s is sitting at fourth in
the Big East and a win could not
only knock Pitt down a notch, but
also put the Red Storm into serious
contention for the Big East regular
season title. As Woodall knows, a

Brad Wanamaker (No. 22) helped lead the Pitt men’s basketball team
to three wins without leading scorer Ashton Gibbs.

win would also add to St. John’s
NCAA Tournament resume and the
Red Storm seniors, who have never
played in the tournament, will be
looking for a bid this year.
“[St.John’s is] playing with a lot
more sense of urgency than last
year,” he said. “They want to make
the tournament. Nobody wants to

go through college without mak- ‘

ing the tournament  I think their
coach is doing a great job of having
the seniorsstep up.”

-:.-.-.- x... .-. l,.,_...; -yh«-.. «- gr.-W ,...,.nuq.—-sg-1.,,;e,,.,,.,,..a..;.,»v~.

Pitt will utilize its talented front-
court rotation that paces one of the
nation’s top rebounding teams.
Forward Nasir Robinson posted
another big game against South
Florida Wednesday, notching a
double—double with 13 points and
10 rebounds.

- Justin Burrell and Pittsburgh‘ ’

native D.]. Kennedy, the Red
Storm’s leading rebounders, will
look to keep pace with Robinson
and 6—foot-11, 250 pound center
Gary McGhee on the boards. How-
ever, Burrell pales in comparison to
McGhee in terms of height, com-
ing in at 6—foot—8 and 240 pounds,
whereas Kennedy plays more as a
guard—forward hybrid.

Do—it—all senior guard Brad Wa-
namaker will also be a huge fac-
tor, bringing his averages of 12.6
points, ﬁve rebounds and ﬁve as-
sists per game into the contest.
After a big game against No. 10 Vil-
lanova in which he led all scorers
with 21 points, the Philly product
led the Panthers over the Bulls on
Wednesday with 13 points and ﬁve
assists. ’

The Red Storm’s leading scorer,
senior guard Dwight Hardy, aver-
ages 17.1 points a game. Defensively,
the Panthers have been able to shut
down the opposition’s star guards
to date this season, with the excep-
tion of Connecticut’s Kemba Walker
in December.

One of the biggest strengths for
the Red Storm is their experienced
roster that features 10 seniors.

“We’re deﬁnitely looking for a
tough game,” Gibbs said. “We’ve got
to come out early and jump on them,
and the rest will carry itsel .”

For the Panthers, the Garden
has turned into a home away from

. home‘ of sorts. Pitt won the 2K _
Sports Classic beneﬁting Coaches
vs. Cancer in the Garden earlier-

this season, although the arena
will certainly be rocking with the
re-energized Red Storm fan base
Sunday.

“St. John’s is playing pretty
well,” Woodall said. “They’ve had
their ups and downs. But the Gar-
den is our home also. So we just got
to keep playing well like we have
been.” d

The Pittbaseball team opens the 2011
campaign in Clearwater, Fla., on Fri-

ready thinking about returning home
on Feb. 25. -

That’s because their new stadium
at the Petersen Sports Complex will

Senior inﬁelder Philip Konieczny
is coming off a year where he almost
doubled his career batting average af-
ter hitting .322 last season, yet those
numbers _aren’t the only thing that
have him ﬁred up.

“After all the years of waiting, it
is great to ﬁnally see [the complex]

BIG EAST BREAKDOWN

Donnie Tasser
Staff Writer

 

This past week, the Pitt men’s basketball
team tightened its, grip on the Big East
regular—season title with a big road vic-

tory over No. 1.0 Villanova and a solid «

home win over South Florida. In the Vil-
lanova victory, neither team’s top 3-point
shooter played, and it showed — the two
teams combined forjust 4 of25 shooting
from beyond the arc. The game broke

the Wildcats’ 46-game win streak at the .

Pavilion, their on-campus arena.

The rest of the conference remains a

battle, however. St-._]ohn’s has won-three
in a row, including a big win again_st Con-
necticut. The Huskies rebounded from
that loss with a victory over red-hot
Georgetown, snapping the Hoyas’ eight-
game win streak, which included victories
over Villanova, Louisville and Syracuse.
Louisville was upset by Cincinnati, one
game after barely surviving against the
Orange. Syracuse beat West Virginia after
losing two straight to Georgetown and
Louisville. Meanwhile Notre Dame has
quietly put up a seven-game win Streak.
Whew.

Big games this week include UConn at
Louisville tonight; Pitt at St. John’s and
Notre Dame at West Virginia tomorrow;
Syracuse at Villanova on Monday; and the
2011 Backyard Brawl 2.0: West Virginia
at Pitt on Thursday. '

Power Rankings

1. Pittsburgh — The Panthers remain
without leading scorer and 3-point shoot-
er Ashton Gibbs, who is hobbled by a
left knee injury. They continue to show
offensive diversity, however. Brad Wana-
maker scored _21 points and Nasir Rob-
inson poured in 15 and recorded seven
rebounds in the Villanova victory. ' ‘

'2.‘Notre Dame — The Irish have pad-
ded their win streak with mostly. Big East
bottom feeders, but they do have big wins
over Pitt and Louisville in there. Ben Han-
sbrough and company will play three
more unranked teams before ﬁnishing
out the season with Villanova and UConn.
They could very easily take a 12-game win
streak into the conference tournament.

3. Connecticut — Behind leading
scorer Kemba Walker’s 31 points, the
Huskies bounced back from an ugly loss
to St. John’s to upend the Georgetown
Hoyas. The Huskies are now in a four-
way" tie for fourth in the conference and
still have Louisville and Notre Dame on
their schedule. 

21. Georgetown — The Hoyas’ win
streak has been broken, but seeing as

Pitt tops power rankings,

they only play one ranked team —- No.
20 Syracuse — over their last four games
and are in sole possession ofthird place‘
in the conference, things still look pretty
good. ' '

5. Louisville’.— The Cardinals just keep
pluggin’ away, but they cannot seem to
find a rhythm. They are 8-5 in confer-
ence play but haven’t won more than two

. consecutive conference games and were

just upset by Cincinnati. This could be a
problem come tournament time, when
stringing together victories is literally
a necessity. '

6. Villanova — The Wildcats remain in
a bit ofa funk. They lost a very physical
three-point game to Pitt — three techni-
cal fouls, 50 shots from the free throw
line and one punch thrown. But that was
sandwiched in between a loss to unranked
Rutgers and a bad, three-point victory
over lowly Seton Hall. Worse still, they
have Syracuse, Notre Dame, St.]ohn’s and
Pitt over their last ﬁve games.

7. Syracuse — The Orange are just 2-4
against ranked conference teams, and
when they lose, it takes them a while to

stop the bleeding. All six losses this sea-

son have come over an eight-game conf
ference span, with losing streaks of four
and two only separated by a two game win
streak over UConn and USF.

8. St. John’s —— The Red Storm break
into my top eight this week with their vic-
tory over UConn. They have some great
wins — Georgetown, Notre Dame, Duke
and UConn — but also some horriﬁc loss-
es: St. Bonaventure and Fordham early

' on, a loss to Cincinnati and big losses by

-alarge margin to Notre Dame, Syracuse,
Louisville and Georgetown. Their season
is like seeing a member of the opposite
sex who seems attractive, until he or she
smiles at you and you notice that he or
she doesn’t have any teeth. I
