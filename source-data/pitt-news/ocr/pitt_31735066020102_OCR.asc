Beer Wars .

Who offers the lowest prices?

By Eric S. Poole
Staff Writer
Last summer, an ad ran in The Pitt

News (June 25, 1986 issue) reading
”Zelda’s — BEER is the game 

- PRICE is the name!!”

Well, thanks to Zelda's Green-
house, the Original Hot Dog Shop
and the University Beverage Center
—- price may still be the name, but
selling beer is now a war in Oakland.

According to Moe Simon _of the
Original, the beer wars began when
the University Beverage Center
opened last summer and began to sell
warm beer at discount prices.

”We only lowered prices to com-
pete [with the University Beverage
Center and Zelda's]/’ said Simon.

Zelda's was the first to get in the
trenches at the end of June, when
they announced a new list of beer
prices.

Sixteen-ounce six-packs of Black
Label and Blatz were lowered by
$1.50 to $2.60. The price of Bud-
weiser fell to $3.60, and Baron von
Funt, a German beer cooler, was

_ priced at $2 for a four-pack.

The Original responded by lower-
ing the price for a six-pack of Bud to
$2.25. Zelda's dropped their price to
$2.75.

The Original then launched an at-
tack on their main competition, the
University Beverage Center, by an-
nouncing the sale of warm beer at
discount prices. When this venture
proved unsuccessful, the ”O” sold

‘cold beer but kept the warm beer

prices. 7

The price slashing at the ”O” in-
cluded cutting the price of a 40-
ounce bottle of Colt 45 to 90 cents
—— the same price that the Original
charges for an eight—ounce draft of
Moosehead or Molson and 10 cents

:

less than a draft of Heineken.
Needless to say, the 40-ouncers
sold out quickly.
Simon felt that part of the motive
may have been jealousy./”We sold
more beer than anyone else in the

‘city, and they [Zelda's] and, to a

lesser extent, the Original Oyster
House] just couldn't stand it.”

The big weapons in the war are
held by the University Beverage
Center and the Original. The Bev-
erage Center has an advantage
because it sells warm beer and can
undersell a place that must use elec-
tricity to cool beer. -

Both places buy beer in large quan-
tities and pay bulk rates for their beer
shipments. Both places have ex-
cellent selections, including the
Origina|’s 200-plus import cooler.

So, next time you go to buy a six-

pack, watch out for the next salvo in ’

the beer wars.

VOLUME EIGHTY-ONE, ISSUE NINETEEN

By Stefanie Frelick
Staff Writer I -

Last spring the Student Govern-
ment Board approved a resolution
urging total divestment from all South
African companies. The impact of the
resolution will be decided tomorrow
evening as Pitt's board of trustees
meets to vote on the divestment
issue.

Student governments in the past
have opposed the university's
policies of selective divestment.

”This [selective divestment] just
isn't going far enough,” said Jim
Mumma, SGB president. ”Pitt thinks
they're helping the blacks of South
Africa with this policy. But they
aren't, since we really only employ
about 1 percent of blacks there.”

Composed by Students for a Free
South Africa and presented to the
SGB for approval, the resolution
states, ”The degenerating situation in
South Africa demands immediate ac-
tion on our part  Any‘ and all
economic gains to our community at-
tained through the business activity
within the apartheid system of South
Africa are morally reprehensible and
antithetical to the enlightened ideals
guiding this institution.”

Another attempt to influence the
board's decision on divestment is the
advisory committee on investments,
a 12-member committee formed last
spring by Pitt President Wesley

». Posvar.

Mumma, who served on the com-

mittee, said he supported the com-

mittee's proposal of compromise in_

the interest of keeping the divestment
issue open. Total divestment, which
Mumma said he_strongly supports,
failed to receive a majority vote.
In anticipation of the trustees
meeting, the Pitt Divestment Coali-
tion sponsored a rally on Wednesday
to urge a vote for total divestment.

  u rgi ng trustees to A  
vote for d ivestmenti

Ellen Dorsey, head of Students for a,
Free South.Africa and co-sponsor of
the activity, expressed disappoint-
ment over attendance at the rally.‘
"You're glad that these events take
place, but I'm never satisfied with the

turnout,” she said. ’’I always want to  S i

see more people.”
Though she hopes for a vote of

total divestment, Dorsey said the vote" S

will probably be-another step along
the select divestment route. S V
”Just enough to give the board

justification for acting, when really‘ i

it's not enough,” she said.
Another participant in. Wednes-

"day's rally was Dennis Brutus,.chair-

man of the black studies department,
who pointed out that Posvar should
follow the lead of Congress on the
divestment issue. 1

Key speaker at the rally was Mweli
Mzizi, a member of the African Na-
tional Congress. He said governmen-
tal sanctions against South Africa
would not be enough. Condemning

the situation in South Africa and lift-
ing the state of emergency and

restraints on media were among his
urgings.

Brutus said he was grateful to the
people of Pittsburgh and the students

for their efforts to achieve university .'
divestment from all stocks and shares ’

from corporations and banks that do
business in South Africa.

’’It is time for Posvar to join over
100 other universities who have
elected to divest,” Brutus said.

Upon these words, students began
chanting, ”Wes|ey Posvar you can't

hide, we know you're on apartheid’s’

side.”
Supporters of total divestment are

planning not to‘ let Posvar or the. .

board of trustees hide tomorrow
evening as they plan to stage a

peaceful demonstration at the board, .

of trustees meeting.

Shortly after the announcement
of a grand jury investigation into
the Krishna community in
Moundsville, W.Va., The Pitt
News published an editorial urg-
ing the members of that commu-
nity to be open and cooperative
during the process.

The investigation is seeking
answers to allegations ofdrug traf-
ficking, child molestation and
murder within the community.

Shortly after the stories were
published, a member of the West

REYKJAVIC, Iceland — President
Reagan and.Soviet leader Gorbachev
ended summit talks in Iceland yester-
day. A dispute over ”Star Wars”
prevented important agreements on
arms control, according to Secretary

of State George Schultz.

Schultz said the Soviets wanted to
change the anti-ballistic missle trea-
ty in order to limit the space-based
missle defense system. Reagan refus-
ed to agree to the changes because
it would threaten the security of the
United States and its allies.

”We are deeply disappointed at
this outcome,” Schultz said.

Gorbachev had proposed a three-
part disarmament program that he
said would reduce strategic weapons
by 50 percent in five years. He said
his plan would have eliminated
medium-range missles in Europe and
Soviet medium-range missle
warheads in Asia.

Gorbachev said he and Reagan
deadlocked over a Soviet proposal of
a ten-year ban on testing space-based

Reagan is expected to blame the

Capitol Hill opinion is split on the

Senator Richard Lugar said the

 Hospital opens‘ breast cancer detection centers

(.21

K)!’

F5

By F. Susan Felder
For The Pitt News

Magee-Womens Hospital has
openedcenters for breast care at the
hospital and in Pleasantville because
they say early detection is the best
way to combat breast cancer.

The centers are under the direction
of Dr. Kathlene Harris, assistant pro-
fessor in the department of radiology
at the University of Pittsburgh School
of Medicine.

One of the purposes of the centers
is for the patients to feel more com-
fortable than they would at a hospital,

according to Harris. The hospital at-

mosphere tends to make people ner-
vous and afraid.
”lt’s a very unpleasant ex-

perience,” Harris said about having
the X—rays done in a hospital.

To make it more pleasant, the
centers are going to be private. Cof-
fee and tea will be served to the pa-
tients. There will be a one-on-one
relationship between the patient and
the physician.

According to guidelines estab-
lished by the American Cancer Socie-
ty, women 35 to 40 should have one
baselinefbreast X-ray, while women
40 to 49 should have an X-ray once
every one to two years. Those over

' 50 should have a breast X-ray every

yeah

Women who have a personal or
family history of breast cancer, who
have never had children or who have

had their first child after the age of

30 are at a higher risk for breast
cancer," according to the ACS. Peo-
ple who are at a higher risk for cancer
mayneed to have more tests more
frequently.

Women between the ages of 20
and 40 should have an exam by a
doctor every three years, and all
women over 20 should do a self ex-
amination every month.

The Breast Care Centers have
videotapes to show how to do a self
examination. They also have models
of breasts on which to practice giv-
ing an exam. There is no charge for
this information.

Harris said that women under 35
are too young to get a mammogram
because they don't want to radiate

younger women. Mammograms are
the best single method of detecting
breast cancer.

Ultrasound breast imaging, a
secondary diagnostic tool, is one of
the safest methods of detecting breast
abnormalities. It uses sound waves to
create an image of human breast
tissue. This method does not involve
radiation and therefore does not in-
volve risk to the patient.

Magee’s Breast Care Centers will
provide comprehensive breast
diagnosis both through mam-
mography and ultrasound breast
imaging.

Although the mammogram gives
off lower levels of radiation than a set
of dental X-rays, the breast X—rays are

not given without a doctor's prescrip-,, 0‘ ' 

tion, according to Harris.

”One out of every 11 women has
breast cancer,” Harris said. It's the
No. 1 cancer among women, with
lung cancer a close second because
of smoking. The cause of breast
cancer, however, is not known and
therefore, neither is a method of
prevention. —

Harris is training other women
radiologists to work in the centers.
She said that women feel more com-
fortable with other women.

Magee Hospital also has plans to
open another center, in Moon
Township. For more information

about Magee’s Breast Care Centers,

Hip drug wars
are overblown

I 1986 could well go down in history as the year when the national
paranoia about illegal drugs and the "war" on these drugs reached

' -their highest points.

The "drug epidemic” is the catchy topic in every newscast, and
promises of anti-drug legislation are a part of virtually every platform

in this fall's elections. Many are beginning to realize that a terrible ,
drug problem does exist in the United States. ’

But, how’ many?

The Secretary of ‘Health and Human Resources released a report
on Thursday, Oct. 9, that showed that drugvuse has not increased
in this country over the last three years. According to the HHR

'  spokesman, Charles Kline, drug use is actually going down except

for cocaine use in the 12- to 17-year-old age bracket.

That report shows that‘ the current ”war on drugs” is, for the most
part, a paranoid obsession. True, there are many drug users, but those
in the forefront of the anti-drug movement want us to believe that
nearly everyone is engaged in the use of one illegal substance or
.-another. ' I

On Wednesday, Oct. 8, the House passed a $1.8 billion anti-drug
bill that imposes the death penalty on dealers convicted on drug-

! related murders -— yet another symptom of our national paranoia.

All of this attention being given to a problem that barely exists is
almost comical. '

The U.S. government should accept the fact that it's dealing with

_ a problem that's been exaggerated by the press and the White House.
_ As long as there's a demand, there'll be a supply. Politicians should-

concentrate on diminishing the demand through education. Before
they know it, the supply will wither and disappear.

Minorities aren't
all alone in need

On Wednesday, Oct. 8, The Pitt News ran a front-page story con-
cerning the Black Action Society's call for more financial aid for black
students at Pitt. BAS Executive Assistant Donald Frazier was quoted
as saying, "It is a known fact that if you're [a] black at the University
of Pittsburgh, you have to possess exceptional athletic ability to gain
any type of attention or recognition. And those with just a‘ simple
desire to obtain a high degree of knowledge are being ignored."

Well, Mr. Frazier, welcome to reality. The problem about which
you speak is one not only confronted by blacks. All students at a
universityvﬁas large as Pitt must realize that unless they do something
exceptional, they are likely to be ignored. "

The current method of allocation of financial aid is probably the

A . most racially unbiased and equitable program at Pitt. Everyone who

applies is judged by the same single criterion — earned income. It's
that simple. Earmarking financial aid monies for the exclusive use
of minority students is wrong, prejudicial and discriminatory. Non-
minority students often come from disadvantaged backgrounds too.
Every year there are many non-minority students who are forced to
leave school for financial reasons. Why are you so silent about them?
It is a shame that something like this has to happen, but it does. No
one is guaranteed a college education. Many have to work and
sacrifice to obtain that education. The whole point of ”going away
to college” is to learn self-sufficiency and how to function in the real

' world.

The sooner students realize this, regardless of race, the better off
everyone will be.

ZBT pledge gives rebuttal  

This letter is in response to the let-
ter written by the new vice president
of Zeta Beta Tau fraternity. I am an
undergraduate alumnus of your fra-
ternity. This is a contradiction of
terms to many but not to myself and
my brothers who were ousted by our
trustees and never given an official
reason to explain our. demise. Our
brotherhood wasn't even supposed
to know about the reorganization for
the fraternity until classes were over
in April '86. We were going to be
notified by mailthat we were no
longer members of the fraternity that
we were proud to be affiliated with.
I guess since the brothers found out
that a reorganizat_ion was going to
take place, ZBT national didn't feel
obligated to send us a letter, note, or
scrap of paper to tell us why we were
given premature alumni status.

._ I personally feel that this reorgan-
ization is a cop-out for all those who
recommended it to be done. I think
that a reorganization is a drastic
means of solving the problems of a
fraternity. Why couldn't our trustees
have -held a meeting with the brothers
to try to work out our problems? is
it because they wanted to increase
the Jewish membership of the frater-
nity and the current brothers
wouldn't rush just a specific group of
people? I think that's part of the
reason. Many of the new "founding
fathers" of the fraternity are Jewish.
I hope I do not offend any of the new
members of the fraternity, I mean on-
ly to offend the trustees of ZBT and
the folks at ZBT national that acted
so rashly in this decision. We learned
that brotherhood was for life, but at
ZBT, brotherhood lasts until you
make mistakes or your trustees don't
like you. Of course, the trustees will
tell you something entirely different.
I can just imagine the; lies and
‘stretched truths they told the new
members. However, the trustees
never gave the Phi and Chi pledge
classes a chance _to solve the prob-
lems we faced. These were the last
two pledge classes before the reor-
ganization. There was great unity be-
tween these two pledge classes and
the desire for improvement. The trus-
tees never communicated with the
new members or the brotherhood as
a whole. They only spoke with the
officers of the fraternity, but most of
the communication occurred be-
tween the trustees and our only
Jewish brother. No, he wasn't the
president of the fraternity. When he
was told 'about the reorganization
plans he was also asked to make a list
of 10 brothers that would be allowed
to stay to restart the fraternity. This
plan was scrapped because 1 of its

LETTERS

discriminatory overtones. The new
plan "called for getting rid of all the
current brothers and starting over
with people that the trustees like. And
that's what they did. ‘
Furthermore, I would like to tell
Paul Abrams that he did not humil-
iate the Chi pledge class with his let-
ter. Also, those of us who lived
through this ordeal know that the
Greek advertisement that offended
you so much was not directed toward
”the entire Jewish population" as you
so narrow-mindedly believe. It was
directed to the.ZBT officials who
discriminated against new and cur-
rent members because they were not
the type of people that the officials
would have chosen. I thought frater-
nities were supposed to be student
organizations. Lastly, I would like to
ask Paul I Abrams and his new
brothers how they would feel if after
this term they were told that they
could not belong to the fraternity, or
if after they were brothers for a term
and had spent over $400 for [the]

. pledge initiation fee and brothers

dues, they were told it was all over.
No official explanation. ‘Try to im-
agine how we felt before you say that
the Chi pledge class was not Zebe
material. How can you say that they
are not Zebe material when you
weren't even there during their
pledging?

”Nobody can do everything, but
everybody can do something, and if
everybody is doing something, every-
thing will get done," (Gil Scott
Heron). Keeping the preceding state-
ment in mind, the following is
directed to the editorials of Glenn
Ponas, and the usual heartless person

' who suddenly doesn't have a name!

("Name withheld upon request” and
all others who question my motives
for calling for financial aid for minori-
ty students)

It should be known that my prior-
ities lie with God, family, friends and
my people in that order. I cannot save

the world; however, if I could I ,

would. I don't doubt for a second that
some white students have financial

aid problems, but I am only one per-‘

son. My title with the Black Action
Society is exec_utive assistant. And as

executive assistant I will carry out my
duties and follow my heart: My heart
tells me to stand up like a man and
fight for my people. So excuse me for
looking out for our best interest. We
can work together when it is in
everyone’s interest, but as people
who are basically survivors, we must
be expected to fight for our best in-
terests first, it's only human nature.
It is agreed that equality must exist
in today's society for a peaceful ex-
istence here on Earth. However, if
you had taken a look at the percen-
tage of minority students leaving the
university due to lack of sufficient
financial aid in comparison with that
of Caucasion students you would
have shut your mouth and put your
pen down! It is this type of ignorance
which causes unnecessary tension,
and this ignorance is a heavy burden
to carry!

It should be known to those who
are not familiar with the Black Action
Society's function that we exist to en-
sure that the political, culfural,
academic and social needs of minori-
ty students [are met]. I don't for a
minute believe that you would ex-
pect the NAACP to work for Cauca-
sian students while black and other
minorities suffer twice as much. It
simply is not in their self-interest. I ap-
preciate your comments and con-
cerns but the reality of the situation
causes me to fight and fight hard for
my people! Must it be insinuated that
I am a racist or a hypocrite? I too seek
justice and equality for all. For exam-
ple, for the past three years black
enrollment has dropped every year
4.3 percent. And at this university it
has been estimated that if you ran-
domly picked 100 Caucasian stu-
dents and 100 black students, in four
years 84 Caucasian students would
be wearing caps and gowns while
only 38 black students would be
wearing the same. Now maybe-I'm
crazy, but that doesn't seem like
equality to me! Peace be with you all!

Q‘-

THE.Pl'lT NEWS, Monday, October 13, I986

James Durczak, 39, is a freelance
photographer who, as an avocation,
spends a great deal of time thinking
about the criminal justice system and
what's wrong with it.

Lately Durczak has been thinking
about the much—publicized over-
crowding of America's prisons and
jails — and the fact that, even with
all those overcrowded facilities —-—
crime on the streets remains a serious
problem.

”The movies you see on TV, the
reports that are on 20/20, the things
you read in the newspaper — all of
them say what bad shape the prisons
are in,” Durczak said. ”The solutions
that are proposed are always the
same: build more prisons, tax citizens
more. Where does it end?”

Durczak has done some pondering

» on this question and has come up

with a different solution that’ is
radical, to put it mildly.

He refers to it as ”r'ehabilitation by
amputation.” Let Durczak explain it
himself:

”lnstead of letting criminals plea-
bargain, let them digit-bargain. What
l’m proposing is that criminals be

. allowed to reduce their sentences by

having their fingers cut off. For every
year they are sentenced to prison,

“This is it

Since the beginning of the term,
numerous articles, letters and ads
have appeared concerning the Zeta
Beta Tau fraternity — its closing, its
reorganization and arguments for and
against each. What I hope to do with
this piece of writing is, once and for
all, present the true facts (not my in-
terpretations or opinions, they will
come after) of the matter and finally
put an end to whatever squabbles
which have now ensued. I have a
right to do so because I am a member
of ZBT and now an alumnus of Pitt's
chapter.

First of all, the closing of the
chapter last year was not based on
one particular reason but a whole
group of them. Also, these same
reasons were not due, at least not
primarily, to the majority of last year's
brothers, but were an accumulation
of problems stemming from as far
back as the late '70s.

Lately, I have been hearing many
rumors around our campus as to
what really happened with ZBT.
Some of them have been true, while
others are so utterly ridiculous they
make me hysterical.

In 1980, 80,000 Soviet troops
marched across the. border into
Afghanistan. That was six-and-a-half

years ago; today they are still there,
but not for much longer.

When the Soviets went into
Afghanistan, they were merely going

to stay for a few months, help prop _ I

up a socialist government on their
border, put down a small unstable

coup and walk right out again with —

all just fine and dandy in their soon-
to-be communist utopia. Instead, they
stepped into a beartrap. This was not
a small uprising by a few fundamen-
talist extremists, but a full scale
revolutionary war against leaders and
a form of government the Afghans
hate.

It's been sixyears of down and dir-
ty guerrilla warfare for the Afghans.
They have sustained an estimated
250,000 casualties; there have been
whole villages relocated, burned or

destroyed. They have lost control of.

over 85 percent of the roads, ‘most of

they can get a year off by having one
joint of one finger removed.

”I’m totally serious about this. I
think it would go a long way toward
alleviating the crowded prisons. If
you went to a prisoner who had, say,
five years left to serve on his

sentence, and you told him that he ‘

could get out immediately if he
agreed to have five finger joints am-
putated, he just might say yes.

”This would be completely volun-
tary. It would cost the state nothing;
the prisoner would have to pay for
the surgery himself, and the price
would not be that much because the
amputation of a finger joint is
relatively simple surgery. And the
prisoner would sign a waiver releas-
ing the state, the physician, the gover-
nor and the scalpel company from all

' liability.

”The choice of finger joints would
be completely up to the prisoner.
Let's use that example of a five-year
sentence again. The prisoner could
have one complete finger removed,
which would count as three joints,
and then have the tips of two other
fingers removed to make it five joints.
The selecion of what joints to be am-
putated would be the decision of the

 

BOB" GEENE

prisoner and the prisoner alone.”

Now . . obviously this sounds
shocking. But one thing I have found I
about seemingly crackpot ideas over
the years is that a surprisingly large
number of people find them perfect-
ly reasonable. I could tell that Durc-
zak wasn't joking, so I asked him
how he thought the rest of the
American public would respond to
all this.

”Pretty positively, I think,” Durc-
zak said. ”|t’s a throwback to the old
days: an eye for an eye, a tooth for.
a tooth. It's biblical. You do

something to someone, you have the
option of paying by giving up part of
your body.

”We’re living in hard-line times,
with people very angry about crime.
I think it might make victims feel
good — to know that the criminal is
giving up part of himself to pay for
the crime.”

Durczak said that his plan might
help lessen crime on the streets, too.
”When criminals get out of prison,
many of them go right back to their
criminal ways," he said. ”At least this
way, every time they looked at their
hands they would be reminded of
how badly they wanted to get out of
prison once they were in.

”And another thing -— this would I

be a one-time-only option- If you're
. in prison and you choose the option

of getting out by having some finger ‘

joints amputated, if you were arrested
and convicted again you couldn't go
the amputation route again. You
would have to serve your full term.
We wouldn't want people taking ad-
vantage of the system.”

Our society is_supposed to abhor
the idea of ’’cruel and unusual
punishment.” Doesn't Durczak think
that his plan is about as cruel and

 

unusual as you can get?

”I really don’t,” he said. ”Oh, I’lm,l_.l 

sure some lawyers would run into
court saying that it was cruel and
unusual, but that's their line of work.
Remember that this would be a vol-.

untary choice on the part of the

prisoners. No one would be forcing

them to do it, or even advocating that .   3

they do it. If they thought that giving ‘

up finger joints would make their 5 I ll

lives better than sitting in prison cells,

then who are we to call it cruel and ';

unusual?”

Durczak feels that if a national"  
referendum were held on his idea,’

the results would be about 50-50.

”You’d get the bleeding hearts‘

against it,” he said. ”But you'd get

the people who are sick of crime and  5" 

sick of paying taxes to provide food
and shelter for prisoners. "

_ ”At least it's a new idea._All we

hear from legislators is the same old“ . . 
stuff: build new prisons, pay $20  7 ;:’.

million for rehabilitation programs.”

’’If we started to cut off prisoners’ .

fingers, justice would be seen as swift
and complete. The public would be
happy, the victims would be happy,

and the prisons wouldn't be so. '

crowded. Isn't that what everybody
wants?”

e last word on ZBT, hopefully  

Yes, it IS true that one of our past
presidents, one Michael G. Mavris,
embezzled a few thousand dollars
from our treasury. He is currently be-
ing sought after by our national
organization. He is living in Manhat-
tan and should face a prison sentence
or deportation back to his homeland
— Greece, No, it is not true that this
same person killed someone and we,
the other brothers, gave him our
treasury to flee the country.

Yes, it is true that our trustees, in
their own way, tried to help us get
out of the problems which they

helped cause. The two main trustees '

did try a lot of different avenues to
ease the burden. However, due to
personal preferences on the brothers’
part, they were often ignored.
Perhaps our loss, perhaps not. No, it
is not true that these same trustees or
the national organization of ZBT tried
every measure they could to save us
from everything going wrong. In
many situations beyond our (the
brothers and the two main trustees)
control, we were left floundering. A
good business move, perhaps? Pitt's’
chapter is very small compared to

the river channels, all airports, major
cities and railroads. Mujhedin sym-
pathizers have been maliciously
persecuted. They have been attacked
by gas, chemical and nerve gas
weapons.

The Mujhedin are winning. I

The Soviets have charged into a
war that has been compared to what
Vietnam was for the United States.
Since 1980, they have boosted the
numbers of men stationed in Afghan-
istan from 80,000 to over 165,000.
They have had an estimated. 70,000
casualties, over 20,000 desertions,
and it has been estimated that they
have spent over $150 billio\n on this
so-called ”police action.”

Soviet troop morale is very low.

Alcoholism among the officers is over»

75 percent; drug abuse among

enlisted is even higher. The drugs are -

supplied by Afghan dealers who use
the profits to finance the rebels. Serv-
ice in the military in the Soviet Union

is compulsory for two years after.

other schools.

Yes, it is true that the group of peo-
ple who called themselves brothers
were very diverse. We had everyone
ranging from Ronald Reagan conser-
vatives to Woodstock liberals. It is
also true that the brothers finally

, separated, and ZBT became a divid-

ed house. No, it is not true that
everyone in the house was gay and
what we would call parties were ac-
tually giant homosexual orgies. Many
females on this campus will attest to
that. It seems the gay label goes
around to a different house each year,
and it is never true. Whose turn is it
this year, Sigma Chi’s? Ridiculous.
Yes, it is true that ZBT was original-
Iy formed as a Jewish organization.
It is also true that the national
organization was not happy with the
low number of Jewish brothers we
had..No, it is not true that the house
closed due to any anti—semitic

completing formal education, so this
means that most troops are in their
late teens — younger than many peo-
ple attending Pitt.

A Soviet deserter from the 40th Red
Army in Afghanistan, Mikola Mov-
chan, said that drug use is so high
because the troops are there involun-

tarily, and they try just about anything

for an escape and a way to make the

time pass just a little bit quicker.

Mikola also said that many of the

ones who don't turn to drugs become

"twisted” and often harass and beat
new recruits or sit aroundvand brag

about things such as how many

rebels they have disemboweled.

Many desert. -Desertion is such a

problem that deserters are generally

shot on sight. ‘Mikola himself was
chased by a heavily anned Hind-D

ideologies of the brothers.

In looking at such a situation, I feel
that a solid definition must be given
to the word fraternity. The generic
answer would be a group of men
with similar interests who band
together. This is all well and good,
but in modern society, or at least
modern campus societies, it goes
deeper. ’ _

The ”fraternity” to which I refer
must be looked upon as an elitist
group. By saying this I mean that any
group which sets itself aside from
society, and this covers everything
from the Girl Scouts to Freemasonry,
should be classified as an elitist
group. Now, when such a group does
set itself separate from society, it must
be realized that the group will be
measured against society's precepts
and in turn be measured by society
itself. This is where a new term, im-
age, enters.

Image and growth go hand in
hand. With a good image, the group
will prosper. With a bad image, no
growth occurs at all.

Such was the problem with ZBT.

News of the war in the Soviet
Union is so distorted that.troops be-
ing sent to Afghanistan have absolute-
ly no idea as to the real situation.
Soviet television shows beautiful
Afhgan women throwing their arms
around their ”|iberators” while
cheering _.crowds roar in the
background. During training, recruits
are told they will be fighting
Pakistani, Chinese and American
mercenaries.

\ It is obvious that at the rate of attri-
tion, disintegration of morale and the-
severe strategic losses that the Soviets
have sustained in the last year, that
they are going to have to pull out
soon. Increased numbers, of arms
from western Europe, Pakistan, the
United’ States and hijacked Soviet
convoys have strengthened the Mu-
jhedin still further. I, personally,
would doubt that the Soviets could
hold out until 1990.

other and ZBT in general became ’

such ‘a cancer in the house that I
doubt the coming of the messiah
would have saved it. We couldn't
agree on anything, from pledges to
Greek Week, and that was the final
and overriding factor in the demise
of ZBT. ~

Now the house is reorganized with.
35 new people, and the crap is still
flying. Why?

To anyone associated with the old , I

house: Stop plotting any more
revenge strategies and face the fact.
that, for all intents and purposes, our
house is dead. Instead, revent your
energies into helping the new group
grow. You once cared about ZBT as
deeply as they do —- let them have
the fraternity we never could.

To the new brothers: You should
also stop with any rebuttal plans you

may have. Realize what you have _

now once belonged and still belongs
to 45-plus others on campus. Learn
from our mistakes and accept advice
when given. Most of us are behind

you all the way; don't shut this op- I

portunity out.
Good and Welfare.

its end  

Things are not going so well for the
Soviets on the home front either.
Despite the massive propaganda‘

campaign and outright lies of the ,

Soviet media,‘ the soldiers who have

served their tour of duty are return- I I

ing home in ever increasing numbers"
and the truth about the war is finally

getting out. This year there have been

protest marches in many major Soviet

cities against the war in Afghanistan,

some drawing crowds as high as

50,000. Imagine that! In the Soviet

Union no less! ‘ * '

I think that it is a hopefulsign in
an age of continued Soviet aggression
that an invaded nation has takena
stand never to surrender while they
still possess the means to resist. This
is proof positive that as long as peo-
ple are willing to fight for. their
freedom that Soviet imperialism is
destined to fail. .

No people who are free and are
willing to fight to preserve that
freedom can ever truly be conquered.

come, first-serve basis only because
space is limited to 90 students.

The participants in the program are
helped in four major areas:
academics, counseling, physical
fitness and cultural development.

During the summer, the students
spend their time at the University of
Pittsburgh. In the morning there are
classes, followed by counseling and
the fitness programs. The students are
often taken on field trips to various
corporations and colleges.

Jeana Kelly, a junior chemistry ma-
jor at Pitt, was an Upward Bound par-
ticipant. She said Upward Bound is
an excellent opportunity to adjust to
the atmosphere of college life.

The program's studies are stren-
uous and help students develop the
study habits and discipline that are so
important in college but so rarely
learned in high school.

The courses taught to the students
in the summer are the regular sum-

rightists would have us believe,” said
Moe'Seager, a local producer and
member of the Americans organiza-
tion. ’’It is to de-glorify and de-
romanticize killing.” _ i

The evening will consist of music,
humor, politics and film ‘presented by
several entertainers including Coun-
try Joe McDonald (of Woodstock
fame) and Dr. Clements himself.

Clements began this traveling
documentary as a result of the sweep-
ing "Rambo" phenomenon across
the country. The press reported the
U.S. interception of the Egyptian
airliner carrying terrorists as an act of
”Ramboism.” _ .3
:« In Seattle, Vietnam vets preaching
non-intervention. in ‘military affairs
were forced out of a high school by
jeering crowds chanting, “Rambo,
Rambo, Rambo.” . .

Clements said this has gone too far.

Seager said this new surge of
macho ideology is actually the pro- «

Besides the classes, tutoring is of-
fered. Students must have at least a
B in every class they take in high
school, or else they are required to
attend at'|east one tutorial session a
week. These tutorials are designed to
strengthen each student's individual
weakness.

One of the most important aspects
of Upward Bound, according to both
Kelly and Williams, is the push to get

’-‘go step—by-step with you.” Every en-
try is checked over, and every ap-

V Upward Bound also includes prep-
aration for the PSAT, SAT and the
MQST, to name a few. All of these
scores are kept on record.

After completing the program,
many of the participants, like Kelly,
are asked to return as counselors.

Kelly felt that counseling"was not

' only a rewarding experience, but it

also allowed her the opportunity to

' make a lot of friends.

Part of her duties as a counselor
were to explain what she and her
fellow students learned from their ex-
perience at Upward Bound.

She explains that many students’

would have never developed enough
motivation or self-esteem to attempt
to go to college without the program.

Williams said the success rate of

cent of the participants complete high
school, 93 percent enter some type
of post-secondary school, 48 percent
of those entering post-secondary
school complete it, and 15 percent
get a graduate or professional degree.

Williams believes that approx-
imately 95 percent of these students
would have never gone beyond high
school without the program.

Students come mainly from seven
area high schools: Schenley, Oliver,
Central Catholic, St. Paul's, Peabody,
Langley and Perry.

- The Pitt News

NEW VRINDABAN, W.Va. —

~ ”The state police took some girl 

she's 17. She's of legal age in

Missouri,” Srila Bhaktipada said as he
‘hung up the phone.

One of the devotees quickly left the
room to handle the latest in a chain
of crises Krishna leader Bhaktipada
called ”a kind of harassment from the
local government.”

The parents of a teen-age girl from

’ Missouri had calledupon the West

Virginia State Police to retrieve their
daughter from the New Vrindaban
Krishna headquarters and bring her
home.

”They came to get her, which they
are glad to do,” Bhaktipada ex-
plained. ”This kind of thing happens
all the time.”

”This kind of thing” has been

, receiving more publicity since the

murders of Steven Bryant last May
and Charles St. Denis in 1983, which
have been linked to Thomas Dresher,
a former Krishna devotee.

They are the motivation ' for a
federal grand jury investigation of
allegations of child molestation, drug

- I trafficking and murder against the

Krishnas.
’’It’s an investigatory grand jury 
' as much in the Krishnas’ best interest
as anybody’s,” said William Koli—
bash, a U.S. attorney who heads the
investigation. ’’If there's nothing go-
ing, on, let's find out.”
Bhaktipada claimed his communi-
ty was. not guilty of any wrongdoing.
_, ”I.don’t think they haveenough dirt

. ‘ to go on,” he said. ’’I don't think

they've found anything we've done
wrong.”
' . He dismissed the subject of the in-
' vestigation with, ”AII.I know is what

 

claim com

I read in the newspapers.”

Bhaktipada founded the New Vrin-
daban community 20 years ago after
seeing an advertisement in the San
Francisco Oracle for someone to
found an ashram, or teaching temple,
in West Virginia.

Bhaktipada, 59, founded the com-
munity on the instructions of his
guru, Srila Prabhupada, who
established the International Society.
for Krishna Consciousness in 1968.

”When I came here, I had seven
dollars in my pocket,” Bhaktipada
said. ”I had to live for the whole
winter on that. I bought a bag of oats,
a bag of rice and a bag of sugar.”

As more people got involved in the
sect in the late '60s, the community
grew, and construction of the present
temples began.

The central structure of the com-
munity ,is Prabhupada’s Palace of
Gold, an inlaid marble and carved
wood tribute to the Krishna spiritual
master. -

Construction of the palace, which
took three years of work by 200
devotees, was originally intended as
a residence for Prabhupada.

Prabhupada died while construc-
tion was still going on in 1977, and
Bhaktipada decreed the structure
would become a shrine to the guru,
symbolizing the followers’ devotion.

By the time the palace was com-
pleted in 1980, over $400,000 had
beenspent on materials, according
to Gadad Har, a devotee.

”The devotees were completely
unskilled when they started the
work," Bhaktipada said.

Initiates seeking spiritual enlighten-
ment make the pilgrimage to New
Vrindaban from across the country.

Many remain with the community
only for a short time; others come
with the intention of establishing per-1
manent residence.

Srila Bhaktipada, spiritual leader of the New Vri_ndaban Krishna community, says the children
of the community are fortunate to be born into the elevated life they enjoy at the Ashram.

that have come here [to live] have
left,” Bhaktipada said. '

He claimed he has no misgivings
about the people who have left the
community. The most common rea-
son for excommunication is failure to
adhere to the Krishna's basic prin-
ciples: abstinence from meat, intox-
icants, gambling or illicit sex.

‘ ”We preach, we give them many

6 chances,” Bhlaktipada said. ”If they

are stubborn and. will not correct
themselves,-we have no choice;

”They’re not ready to make the
sacrifices,” Bhaktipada said. ”Maybe
they don't likethe food.”

Apart from the daily activities of
chantingiand praying, the Krishnas
are involved in the distribution of

food to the needy families inthe area '

and in drug rehabilitation programs.
Prabhupada opened the first tern-

ple on the Lower East Side of New _

York, catering to the despondent drug
addicts in_ the area. 1

’’Most of the people in this room
were drug addicts at one time,”
Bhaktipada said.

”Most of our devotees come from
that group of people [drug culture in
New York],” he continued. ”A per-
son who becomes involved with
drugs is seeking something.”

”I was seeking, and all the answers

U

were here,” said Ajeya Das, one of
the 19-devotees in the room while
the guru was being interviewed.

Bhaktipada saidthe Krishna chant-
ing is an"’easy path to enlighten-
ment” and that the community was
founded .on the slogan, ”stay high
forever.”

"The only way to stay high forever"
is to give up drugs," Bhaktipada said.
”You can't ask a man to give up a
pleasure unless you can give him a
higher pleasure.” - -

The Krishnas believe that as-a per-
son learns to accept God, he will be

born into a higher existence until he. _
reaches‘ communion with Krishna ,

and advances into the spiritual world.

There, are about 230 children liv-
ing in the community. Most were

-1 _born within the community and have

lived there since birth.

”All of our childrenare very -for-
tunate [to be born into the communi-
ty] in one sense," Bhaktipada said.
”They never know certain aspects of
this degrading culture.”

”Maybe they [the children] were
searching in a previous life,” a
devotee offered.

Bhaktipada was quick "to agree.
”Yes, that's it,” he said. ”Of course.

The assembled group of devotees
were at the interview to hear their
spiritual leader speak.

”You gain enlightenment merely
from the sound waves of his voice,”
Gadad Har said. ”Being -in his
presence for one-eleventh of a sec-
ond gives you eternal good.”

”I'|| stay until I find a’f|aw," Ajeya
Das said. ”I don't accept blindly.”

Each morning at 4:30, there is a ser-
vice for all the devotees in the com-
munity, 1 .

They begin with approximately an
hour of_singing and dancing. After a

-spiritual sermon from Bhaktipada,

there are, Sanskrit lectures for the
children. _

The chi|d_ren live apart from their
parents in. ashrams with their
teachers. Fifteen teenage boys live

with Bhaktipada, sleeping on the .

floor while the house awaits com-
pletion.

”I work with my father; I see him
all the time,” a young devotee said.
* During the entire’ service, the
women and girls were separate from
the males, standing at their own altars
to one side of the room.

The reason for separation of the
sexes is ”for purposes of celihacy,”
the guru said. _

At the end ofmorning services, a
speaker announced that one of the
devotees, Chandra Shekhara, would
be traveling to Pittsburgh that day and
invited other devotees to join him.

”There will be a bus leaving at
10:30 for Pittsburgh,” he said. ”Sorry,
it will be a men's bus; women are
welcome to go, but they will have to
find their own transportation.”

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, October 13, 1986

By Teresa Candori
and Matthew Thornton
The Pitt News

MOUNDSVILLE, W. Va. — ’’So,

you kids are doing a story on the
Krishnas.” The-woman behind the
counter at Butch’s Corner shook her
head. I .
”WeIl, you guys are gonna need a
lot more of them before you're
through,” she said as she pointed to
a bottle of aspirin on the counter.

’’I don't know too‘ much about
them,” she said. ”They come in here
every once in a while to buy beer and
cigarettes and lottery tickets.”

Since everything we'd heard about
the Krishnas up to that point in-
dicated a philosophy forbidding
drinking, smoking and gambling, we
pondered the woman's words during
the 10-minute drive to the temple.

As we rounded a bend, the Palace
of Gold came into view — an aston-
ishing sight in the West Virginia
sunset. .

Touted as the ”Taj Mahal of the
West” in tourist brochures, the gold
leaf—encrusted, marble monument
seemed out of place among the rug-
ged hillsides. .

Floodlights shining on the gold leaf
provided the only ligh_t as we unload-
ed the car. Gadad Har, who was to
be our nearly constant companionfor
the next 12 hours, approached us as

., our photographer was setting up his‘

equipment.

Since our appointment to interview
Srila Bhaktipada was less than an
hour away, our tour of the palace was
brief. -

The tour guide showed us 32 kinds

of marble from 17 different countries
and wood carvings from ‘Bombay.
Each of the Strauss Crystal
chandeliers hanging in the palace
matched a corresponding stained-
glass window.

You need more than a degree  

We were given permission to
photograph the rooms in the palace,
a privilege not usually granted
visitors. It was, apparently, the first of
many exceptions made for us. Per-
haps the most interesting was the ac-
ceptance of a female reporter in the
men's ashram. Women are generally
restricted to designated areas in the
community. ,

When Gadad Har woke us up at 4
a.m. for the daily worship service, we
seriously wondered about the
wisdom of abstention from caffeine.
Before doing anything, we set out in
search of coffee.

We found salvation at a country
store about five miles from-the
temple. V.

”So, you kids are doing a story on
the Krishnas,” said our savior as he
made a second pot. ”Well, I know
some people you have to talk to
before you leave.”

Religious understanding and _love
of Krishna aside, we were beginning
to believe that all the chanting must
have something to do with rising
every morning at 4 a.m.

Slightly punchy from lack of sleep,
we sat on the floor of the Mounds-
ville City Hall singing ”Take Me
Home, Country Roads” as we waited
for our audience with the Marshall
County sheriff. '

”We’ve had quite a few dealings
with them [the Krishnas],” said coun-
ty sheriff Don Bordenkircher. ”We
get calls of alleged trespassing all the
time." _

Bordenkircher said the problems
are usually worked out by having the
people involved sit down and discuss
the. incident.

He said he doesn't find the
Kpishnas malicious, just strange.

’’I can't understand why we have
a community that has scurvy,
typhoid, hepatitis and rickets,”
Bordenkircher said. ”Last time we
went through something like that was

the Civil War."

Bordenkircher declined to com-
ment on the specific issues of the
grand jury investigation.

”|t’s something that should have
happened years ago,” he said. ”Let’s
put these rumors to rest one way or
the other.”

Bordenkircher regretted that he
couldn't be more open about the in-
vestigation.

”I already got a letter saying, ’you
better shut your goddamn mouth or
we're gonna sue you for slander and
libel,’ ” he said.

The letter, which Bordenkircher
keeps in a desk drawer with a hand-
ful of newspaper clippings, was from
James Lees, an attorney retained by
the Krishnas. ‘ '

”I have recently noted a series of
outrageous remarks attributed to you
in various segments of the media,”
the letter read. ’’It seems very clear
you don't know what the hell you're
talking about.”

The letter was in reference to
Bordenkircher’s statement that Arthur
Villa, a devotee, had fled to Canada
to avoid prosecution in the Charles
St. Denis murder case.

”This county is laden with rumor,
supposition and innuendo about that
community/.’ Bordenkircher said.

”So, you kids are doing a story on
the Krishnas,” said Denzil Butler,
semi-retired barber and part-time
preacher.

Butler has spent the past 15 years
researching the Krishnas and is con-
sidered something of a local author
itY- .
”l’ve been warned not to talk to
you people,” Butler said. ”There’s
fear in this community.”

Butler expressed concern that the
religious community would gain con-
trol of the entire region.

”That sign out there that says
‘You're entering Marshall County’ --
in a few years it'll read ’You’re enter-

Weisberg exhibit shows ne perspectiven lif 

By Jennifer Paro
For The Pitt News

An intriguing and thought-pro-
voking series of paintings are current-
ly being exhibited in Oakland. The
series of 11 paintings, entitled A Cir-
cle of Life, is on display in the
Hewlett Gallery, first floor of the Fine
Arts Building, Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity. And the artist, Ruth Weisberg,
is just as intriguing as her paintings.

'Viewing this collection without
knowing its title, one might have a
dark and pessimistic attitude toward
the paintings. The series depicts a
supposed representation of death
through somewhat gloomy and
shadowed figures.

But through careful viewing and in-
terpretation, the paintings, in fact, are

~- found to be very light and profound-

ly optimistic, as echoed by the title.
The optimism arises from the artist's
talent to determine and then jux-
tapose visual metaphors of lost
humans souls and those precious
memories that are, for the most part,
presently at hand.

The paintings represent the flow of

-time andmemory through the dif-

ferent stages of life. Even though the
paintings coexist, they were not in-
tended to form a progressive series.
That is, each painting stands alone.
The artist, in fact, was faced with the
realization that the series could
possibly be fragmented over time.
Therefore, each painting has a mean-
ingfully universal quality of its own,
enabling it to stand successfully
ahead of others.

-Viewing one painting separately
from the others, one sees a particular
stage of life. And for one who has
knowledge of Weisberg’s back-
ground, one would assume that each
stage is actually a representation of
the artist's life. .

_ -It is interesting to consider that
each of these paintings was con-
ceived and executed after the artist
discovered that she had cancer.
Weisberg has since recovered from
her illness, but one wonders if the
paintings are really a self-portrait of
a dying woman.

, Date:
 Time:
f Place:

Mostly, the paintings are more than
an autobiographical comment; the ef-
fort put into each painting is decided-
ly more ambitious, than a mere
attempt to recreate Weisberg’s life.

Rather, every element of the paint-:

ings is carefully thought out, and it
is clear that the artist values the
power of art to communicate her
thoughts and feelings on life-and
death through her painting.
Weisberg emphasizes that rebirth
is embedded in death and thatin the
end all of the souls congregate, in
some indeﬁnable way, and enter eter-
nity together. This is not to suggest
reincarnation; it is merely to make
death seem lessdark, less empty.
in contrast, these paintings are ac-
tually a representation of life -- a mir-
ror in which to contemplate its many
and varied reflections. The artist's
aim, then, is to deeply move the

speculate about the joys and trag-
edies of the human condition.
Perhaps, though, the most enig-
matic image is a surreal one which
appears in the painting Museum. It
illustrates the coexistence of art and
nature. Through the use of trans-

parencies, one is allowed to enter her ‘

mind and see her thoughts and emo-
tions as she progresses through life.
Weisberg’s experiences are seem-
ingly summarized throughout the
series.
This summarization is most clear-
ly seen in the paintingentitled, Pen-

functions as a keystone, an unlock-
ing element of the hard truth of the
human condition. It also unlocks the
overwhelming feeling of comfort in
art and nature.

Finally, her technique of painting
on unstretched canvas exemplifies
her longing for nostalgia. This tech-
nique provides a frozen feature to
each painting, yet it actually captures
the vitality and movement of the
figures. ’

To clarify, it is as if Weisberg has
taken a photograph and reproduced
it on canvas. There is a sense of

mobility in the figures, yet each is
frozen in time to seize the memory
of a particular moment.

Weisberg is a professor at the
University of Southern California in
the school of fine. arts. She has re-
ceived both bachelor's and master's
degrees from the University of

~ Michigan.

She is also an author of two limited
edition books which contain her
numerous original prints. Further-
more, Weisberg is contributing editor
of Artweek magazine and has'writ-
ten several other articles for

The Pitt Panther--soccer team ex-

tended its losing streakito two games

Saturday night with a 4-0 loss to the

nationally ranked Seton Hall Pirates.

”For 70 minutes our guys played

in a great game,” said Pitt coach Joe

Luxbacher. ”Seton Hall is a really

good team; we'll just have to
regroup.” '

As the game started, Pitt came out
fired up. They moved the ball well,
but just couldn't break through the
Seton Hall defense. On the other side
of the field, the Pirates managed to
work their way up to thegoal, but a
bad pass or a save by Pitt goalie Mark
Hendricks would turn them away.

The game turned strictly into a

ther defense, and 20 seconds later
Seton Hall sophomore Peter
Matischak put the ballinto the net.
The Pirates led 1-0. ’’It was my feel-
ing that the game was over after the
first goal,” said Seton Hall freshman
John Murphy.’ ”We were just too
fired up for them to come back.”
The defenses took over again as
neither offense could muster much of
an attack. Seton ‘Hall took a shot with
5:27 to go in the first half, and Hen-
dricks made a diving catch —— but he
didn't get back up. The 516fans in
attendance held their breath as the
trainers ran onto the field. The game
was delayed for five minutes, but
finally Hendricks got back onto his
feet, and he remained in the game.
Seton Hall tried to take advantage
of the fact that Hendricks was shaken
up by mounting a strong offensive at-
tack, but he stopped all of their shots.
The half ended with Seton Hall ahead

. r

Nationally ranked Seton Hall too much for Pitt soccer teamfi

The second half started as" a con-
tinuation of the first. Seton Hall had
better luck getting through the Pan-
ther defense than Pitt did getting
through the Pirate defense._ Neither
team could get much of a scoring
threat until the 13-minute mark. At
this point, Pirate Pat Hughes scored
to make it 2-0.

”After the second goal we had to
open up,” said Luxbacher. ”When
we did this, it made us vulnerable in
the back. But down two goals, you
don't have much of a choice.”

Pitt;s'ophomore Mike Grimes raced

“ through the Seton Hall defense with
11 minutes left in the game, but his
shot on goal was successfully stop-
ped by goalie Terry Higgins. -

One of the star performers for Pitt
in Saturday's victory against Notre
‘Dame was junior wide receiver
Michael Stewart, who started in place

.,,_. ' of freshman Hosea Heard, who
 , missed the team ﬂight to South Bend.

The 6-4, 201-pound Stewart has
been hampered throughout his career
by injuries. Going into Saturday's
» game, he had caught only six passes

I for 71 yards this season, but he
burned the Irish secondary on seven
grabs for 71 yards.

It was an especially impressive per-
formance considering what hap-
pened in the second quarter.

 

 

On a third and 10 play from Pitt's
18-yard line, Stewart was about to
catcha John Congemi pass when he
got his bell rung by Notre Dame
defensive backs Troy Wilson and
Steve Lawrence. Somehow he re-
turned to the game and made some
important catches for Pitt, including
a nifty 13-yard fingertip grab on a
bullet pass from Congemi.

”This is the best game I've played,”
said Stewart. ”This is the most they
have gone to me, and I was really ex-
cited about that.”

Just like everyone else on the Pitt
squad, Stewart thinks the win will do
wonders for Pitt's confidence. ”We
really needed this win. It's going to
do a great deal for everybody on the
team.”

NOTEBOOK

Stewart wasn't the only impressive
Panther receiver. Sophomore Billy
Osborn led the Pitt receivers with
eight catches for 94 yards, including
a 32-yard catch on the Panthers’
touchdown drive in the third quarter.

The pass from Congemi was a sim-
ple eight-yard sideline pattern, but
Osborn slipped a tackle and rambled

an additional 24 yards down to the.

Irish 15.

Osborn’s emergence as Pitt's top
receiver came at a critical time

because of the loss of sophomore
Reggie Williams to a broken fibula.

His play hasn't gone unnoticed by
his teammates. ”Osborn’s always do-
ing something to help us,” said
Stewart. ’’I’m glad he's on our side.”

0 Backup quarterback Joe Felitsky
transferred to Pitt two years ago from
Notre Dame, and he had one final

,.chance to play at Notre Dame

Stadium in the fourth quarter.

With four minutes left in the game,
Congemi was knocked silly and had
to leave the game for one play. Felit-
sky came in and fired a perfect pass
to Stewart, who unfortunately
dropped the ball. Felitsky’s com-
posure in a critical situation was not
lost on his coach. ”Joe did a. real
good job coming in and handling
himself like that,” said Gottfried.

Beuerlein. Both players saw action in
the first half, but neither was effec-
tive. Yet the Irish entered the locker
room at halftime with a 6-0 lead on
the strength of Carney’s leg. After
missing a first quarter attempt of 41
yards, Carney was perfect on second
quarter tries from 35 and 48 yards.

Despite being down 6-0 at the half
in front of a large, boisterous Notre
Dame crowd, Panther coach Mike
Gottfried wasn't concerned. ”I told
our kids at halftime that we were very
much in the game.”

That advice didn't appear to inspire
the Panthers as they watched Notre

' Dame take the second half kickoff

and drive down to the Pitt 20. That
is where the Panther defense came
up with their biggestplay of the day.

Under a heavy rush by Pitt
defenders Tony Woods and Anthony
Siragusa, ' Beuerlein, rolling right,
threw back to his left. Defensive end
Burt Grossman tipped the ball and
linebacker Steve Apke grabbed it out
of the air, halting the Irish drive, and,
more importantly, _giving Pitt
momentum. .

Starting on their own 17, the Pan-
thers drove 83 yards in 13 plays scor-
ing the go ahead touchdown on a
one-yard sneak by Congemi. The
drive was aided by two very key
plays: a perfectly executed third and
14 screen pass to Heyward, who
rambled 19 yards for a first down,
and a 32-yard completion to Billy
Osborn from Congemi, who avoid-
ed an all-out blitz by the Irish.

The Panthers almost put the game
away on their next drive. But on the

first play of the fourth quarter with a
fourth and goal from the Notre Dame
one, Gottfried decided to go for the
touchdown. His decision backfired as
Charles Gladman was stuffed just
short of the goal line.

Gottfried has no regrets with his
decision even though it failed to
work. ’’I thought even if we didn't
make it we could get the ball back
in good field position,” said
Gottfried.

And why Gladman over the top in-
stead of the 260-pound Heyward
through the middle? ”I just wanted
to use Charles in that situation. He's
somebody we need to work in, and
he needs to get back in our lineup.”

The Irish offense finally got rolling
and took the lead 9-7 with 4:49 left
in the game on a 20-yard field goal
by Carney, setting up the grand finale
in a well played defensive struggle.

After Pitt failed to move the ball on
Notre Dame, the Panthers punted,
giving the Irish possession at their
own 28 with three minutes to go.
Three plays failed to gain a first down
and punter Dan Sorensen lined up for
the punt. The Panther special teams
then came up with their biggest play
of the season, a blocked punt. Gott-
fried sent a 10-man rush, and junior
Matt Bradley tipped the punt, givin
Pitt the ball at the Irish 34. '

Special teams coach Chuck Klaus-
ing suggested going for the block,
and Gottfried is glad he listened to
his advice. ”Chuck told me we
should go forthe block, and I said go
ahead,” said Gottfried. ”We were
very fortunate to get it.”

Five plays later, VanHorne, who
has quickly made people forget who

Mark Brasco is, booted the game win-
ner, giving Pitt its biggest win since,
well, possibly 1983 in the same
stadium against the same team when
Pitt defeated the Irish 21-16.

That thought didn't escape Con-
gemi’s mind. ’’I love playing in this
stadium. It's the greatest place in the
world to play, and I'm 2-and~O here,”
said the fifth-year senior, who has
been nothing short of spectacular this
season. On the day, Congemi was 25
of 47 for 310 yards, including a
remarkable 15 of 21 in the second
half. ‘

The win keeps Pitt's slim bowl
hopes alive. The Panthers improved
their record to 3-2-1 and play three
of their next four games at home.

Notre Dame dropped to 1-4. A sur-
prisingly disappointing start for a Lou
Holtz coached team. Obviously,
Holtz was very upset with the out-
come of the game, especially the
blocked punt which led to the Irish
downfall. ”I was disappointed when
they blocked the punt. I don't know
why that happened," said Holtz.
”Our players’ hearts are broken, and
so is mine.” '

Meanwhile, the _win was a must for
Pitt, a team that has suffered through
many frustrating losses in the last
three seasons, including two this
year. ”I’m happy forthe kids," said
Gottfried. ”They needed to win one
in a tough, critical situation.”

Lady Panthers dominate field in 3
cross country meet at Lehigh; men
finish ninth out of 30 teams

By Greg Sysyn
Staff Writer

The Pitt men's and women's cross
country teams competed this past
Saturday against teams from all over
the East Coast in the Paul Short Invita-
tional at_ Lehigh University in
Bethlehem, Pa.

The men finished ninth out of
about 30 teams, but the women cap-
tured their division by placing five of
the top six overall runners.

Lori Wood, an all-Big East per-
former, paced the Lady Panthers by
finishing first overall with a time of
16:32. Robin Hubauer came in sec-
ond overall with a time of 17:13.
Kristin Laskowski, Gloria Azekegand
Debbie Reilly then proceeded to take
fourth through sixth places, respec-
tively, with times of 18:1 1, 18:12 and
18:16. .

Bob Weiner, an All-America per-
former inithe two-mile relay, was the
highest men's finisher for Pitt by plac-
ing 33rd overall with a time of 31 :48.

The other Panther finishers are as
follows: Paul Friedrich, a freshman
from Bethel Park, came in 39th with
a 31 :58 clip, while Waddle Freeman
placed 40th, one second behind
Friedrich. Joel Ninos, the Big East
steeplechase champion, was the
fourth Panther to cross the finish line

and 61st overall. Pat Malone finished
71st with a time of 32:50.

The next meet on the cross coun-
try schedule is the Big East Cham-
pionships in two weeks at Boston
College.

Despite the fact that the Pitt women
are coming off ofa big win at the Paul
Short invitational and the men im-
proved, the Panthers look to improve
on past showings at the champi-
onships.

The men are looking forward to the
addition of Joe Daniels and Tim
Manes, both All—Americans in the
two-mile relay, who didn't run this
past meet. Both will compete at the
championships because the Big East

”lt was a good game,” said Pitt

sophomore Sam Lanza. ”We kind of

gave up. I don't think that the final

meet is a five-mile‘ course, as op-
posed to the Paul Short Invitational,
which was a six-mile course.

The Pitt women hope to continue
their successful weekend with a solid
effort at the Big East Championships.

Another important factor in an at-
tempt for a better showing at Boston
College is the time difference be-
tween the top Panther finisher and
the fifth Panther to cross the line. If
Pitt can cut down that time, then they
might be able to give Providence,
Villanova and Georgetown some
competition in the men's division

competition in the women's division.

game it really was.”

Pitt's record is now 7-2-1. The Pan-
thers next game is Wednesday at Pitt
Stadium against Youngstown State.
Game time is 7:15.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, October I3, I986

Fortunately for Pitt, the
luck of the Irish finally
ran out on a Saturday
afternoon in Indiana

’’I knew it was going to be a long
day when the Irish Guard puked on
the 50-yard line before the game.”
— Mark Rose, senior, Notre Dame

DAVE

ZAERIS S

. SOUTH BEND, Ind. 7The luck of
the Irish turned sour. _Just when it
seemed like Pitt was going to blow
another sure win, Notre Dame's John
Carney became the goat of the
Midwest.

If Carney would have made a
38-yard field goal with 18 seconds re-
maining, Notre Dame would have
won the game — and the people of
South Bend would have felt good
about themselves again.

But Carney missed; and Notre
Dame fans grumbled.

It wasn't Carney’s fault. The Pitt

- defense went through its weekly

ritual of collapsing late in the fourth
quarter, but it kept the game in-
teresting. They left Notre Dame's
kicker with a lengthy field goal
attempt.

Carney had previously made field
goals of 35, 48 and 20 yards and
missed one from 41 yards out. He
scored all of Notre Dame's points.

The Irish didn't lose because
Carney missed the last field goal --

- they lost because Pitt beat them.

One theory about the game is that
both teams are bad, and one had to
win. It was just a matter of which
team could give the game away.

For instance, Pitt receivers dropped
at least three passes in crucial situa-
tions. And the Irish let Pitt get through
to block a punt late in the fourth
quanen *

But what won the game for Pitt is
Mike Gottfried’s run-and-shoot of-
fense. Panther receivers were open
all day, even though they had trou-
ble handling the ball.

‘The Irish offense is stuck in the days
of Knute Rockne. They played right
into the heart of the Pitt defense,
wasting first and second downs with
off-tackle runs.

Pitt's defense had a lot to do with
the victory. Granted, they let Notre
Dame drive downfield in the final
minute of play, but they didn't allow
a touchdown.

Notre Dame fans were crushed
when their kicker missed a field goal.
But they were just kidding them-
selves.‘ They must have realized they
were lucky to be in the game.

Last week they were embarrassed
by Alabama. Even though they have
one of the toughest schedules in the
NCAA, the Irish are still I-4. And that
record can only get worse.

They must face SMU, Penn State,
LSU and Southern California. Next
week they play Air Force, a team they
haven't beaten in three years. The
Irish could easily finish the season
with nine losses.

The students on the Notre Dame
campus expect too much; they are
living in the past.

It's as if a bubble encloses Notre
Dame, and inside is the typical col-
lege campus with typical college
students. .

This may seem like a gross gener-
alization, but all the students look
like Barbie and Ken. The guys all
wear bright sweaters over their well-
groomed appearance. The girls are
difficult to find, as they are greatly
outnumbered at the school. But their
appearance is different from females
at Pitt. I doubt if they would be seen
walking around in sweats, and they
certainly don't skimp on the make-
up and perfume.

The reason the campus appears so
stereotypical is because of the tradi-
tion and the ethics of Notre Dame.

No beer is sold at football games.
Kegs are prohibited on campus.

_There is one bar on campus, the

”senior bar.” No underclassmen dare
to enter the establishment, as heavy
fines are levied against offenders.

It's not that you can judge a school

by its drinkingpolicies, but students

there aren't treated‘ as responsible
adults. Grades are sent home to their
parents, and students have to call
home to find out how they fared. All
bills are automatically sent home.

The whole area around South Bend
is caught in the same mindset. They
sing God Bless America before the
games, as well as the national
anthem.

The people don't even mind if you
stand up and act as obnoxiously as
you can while rooting for Pitt. The
fans are too nice. It's not fun beating
someone when you feel sorry for
them when they lose.

Before the game, both bands were I

marched onto the field to play their
fight songs. Notre Dame indisputably
has the most inspiring fight song in
college football, but it didn't inspire

the crowd much on Saturday — be- 3

cause leading the band is a small
group of men called the Irish Guard.

Unfortunately, the Irish Guard.
didn't pay attention to the university
drinking policy, and two members
uncustomarily threw up in the mid-
dle of the field. A‘

In the great Irish tradition, the brave
students wavered but marched on.

Notre Dame should modernize its
offense, defense and drinking policy
to deal with today's society. Winning
seasons from years past won't keep
pomp and circumstance -going in-
definitely.
