Members of Oakland Develop-
ment Inc. (ODI) met with the owner
of Wohlfarth’s'Pub Wednesday to
voice fears about the bar’s current
renovation.

Wohlfarth’s owner Ernext Smal-
lis is renovating a two-story
building that occupies an entire
block between Oakland Avenue
and S. Bouquet Street. Smallis
plans to turn old Wohlfarth’s Pub
and an adjacent section of the
building, which housed a pizza
shop before it was destroyed by ﬁre
earlier this year, into a supper club.

The supper club will be named
Chances R.

Wohlfarth’s Pub, according to
some ODI members, has a
tarnished reputation in the Oakland
area.

“All we've ever had to live with
is Wohlfarth’s,” ODI member
Sandy Philips said. “It’s one thing
to say it’s gone now, but there’s a
whole bad history behind it.”

Smallis obtained a building

permit to restore the section of the
building damaged by ﬁre, but it
,was revoked when city building
inspectors learned that the wall
separating Wohlfarth’s and the
Pizza shop had been torn down.
Officials said that work exceeded
the authorization of the permit
Smallis had.

Smallis took his case to the City
Board of Adjustment, seeking a
special exception to expand Wohl-
farth’s.‘

Representatives of People Oak-
land and the South Oakland
Citizen’s Council, spurred by
rumors that Wohlfarth’s was to
become a discotheque, asked the
board to delay its decision until the
Liquor Control Board conducts a
hearing.

Chances R already possesses a

dancing and a liquor license.
Smallis has applied to the LCB for
an extension of the liquor license,
which expires in 1977.

“Nobody has a worse record

than Wohlfarth’s,” Philips said,

“and that’s why we want an LCB
hearing.”

A hearing, according to the
Liquor Control Board, has not been
scheduled.

Chances R, Smallis asserted, is
to be a seafood supper club along
the lines of Poli’s restaurant in
Squirrel Hill with a dance floor and
a bar. “It is not a discotheque,”
Smallis said. Smallis is the owner
of the Moonraker restaurant in
Monroeville, as well as of Chances
R.

ODI and other Oakland civic
associations are chieﬂy concerned
with the effect continued expansion
of Wohlfarth’s and other Oakland
bars will have on the area.

“There’s a growing problem of
congestion in Oakland’s central
business district. Along with bars
come fast food restaurants, parking
problems and the need for more
police in the area,” Jim Ferll, an
ODI and South Oakland Citizen’s
Council member said.

Carter Knocks GOP,
' Promises Bright Future

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

Democratic Presidential hopeful
Jimmy Carter criticized the past
Republican administrations and
pledged a return to strong
leadership with Democrats in the
White House during a campaign
stop in Pittsburgh Wednesday.

“There is no leadership in
Washington,” Carter told a crowd
Of Over 5.000 people in Mellon
Square, Downtown. “We have all
these problems——Watergate, un-
employment, inﬂation, the FBI and
the CIA, and nobody seems to

He promised his administration
would provide leadership in the
tradition of past Democratic presi-
dents like Franklin Roosevelt,
Harry Truman, John F. Kennedy
and Lyndon B. Johnson.

The Carter rally ropped off a

activities after only one week in the

position, citing personal reasons.

The resignation was announced
yesterday be Vice Chancellor of

Busy Health Center Seen

BY SUSAN MANNELLA

New white wallpaper to
cover the old blue interior of the
Student Health Service is the most
visible change in the health center
made over the summer. But, while
most students were away, the
health center was preparing for an
increased work load.

Two full-time physicians, instead
of the one who worked last year,
a nurse practitioner and a newly
appointed, full-time health educa-

L tor will operate the health center,

in addition to the administrators,
nurses and part-time physicians
and specialists who worked there
last year.

The new appointments were
made because the health center
expects its patient business to
double this year since the
mandatory health fee of $16 per
‘term was instituted.

Health Service Director Joanne
K. Robinson said the service
handled 11,000 visits between
September and April of the last
school year, a figure which
probably will double.

Previously, only students who
opted for a health service plan at
the center were treated there and
services were rendered to others on
a fee-for-service basis. With the
institution of the health fee,

, however, all full-time undergra-

duates automatically are eligible
for services.

The fee was instituted to bring in
funds close to $500,000 to aid the
ﬁnancially ailing service. An
additional appropriation of about
$200,000 from Pitt’s general
budget will cover operation costs.

Gerry Hyner. who previously
worked at Penn State’s health
center, will be the health educator.
His duties will include instructing
individuals and _groups in preven-

tive medicine and first aid.

Hyner already has conducted
first aid sessions for dorm resident
assistants. Both he and Robinson
said they hope students will advise

the health service of programs that-

would be of interest to them.

A consumer board, made up of
about 10 graduate and under-
graduate students, has been
formed to take suggestions and
complaints from students.

“Reaction to the health fee has
been varied,” Hyner said.

When the charge was first

introduced, Robinson said, some

students were opposed to it.

“They didn’t know what it was
for,” she said. “They thought it
was health insurance.” A separate
health insurance is available
through the Student Health Ser-
vice, but the $16 charge is for
services, not insurance.

“Our idea is to try to reach
groups of people with programs
while, at the same time, continuing
to take care of people who are ill,”
Robinson said.

The Student Health Service is
located in 205 Brackenridge Hall,
and members ‘of the consumer
board may be reached by phoning
624-5244. -'

IFC Enforces New Rush
Procedure for Parties

To help relieve fraternity-
community tension, frats will
“strongly enforce” a new policy for
rushee admittance to weekend
bashes, according to Interfraternity
Council President Jay McNamara.

Under the new system approved
by unanimous vote at Tuesday's
IFC meeting, rushees will be
required to present both Pitt
identiﬁcation and a rush pass
before they will be admitted to‘ any
party.

In the past, all rush parties
operated on an open policy,
requiring only Pitt identiﬁcation for
admittance.

Rush. passes sold for $1.50
yesterday afternoon in the Student

Union Ballroom where IFC spon-
sored its “Meet the, Fraternity”
program for rushees. They can be
purchased today from 1 to 5 p.m. in
301 Schenley Hall.

McNamara said money from the

' admittance fee will be used to hire

Pittsburgh police to patrol Bayard
Street on party nights.

“The rush procedure is being
changed to control crowding
around the houses and cooperate
with neighbors,” McNamara said.

After charges of irresponsible
behavior were leveled against six
Bayard Street frats this summer,
Vice-Chancellor for Student Affairs
Alfred Moye advised IFC to take
measures to alleviate community
tension. ‘

Fifth Ave Revamp Planned 3eC”'”Y 3Y5le”‘ W°’k5

BY BILL MOORE

More than $4 million will be

spent to reconstruct Fifth Avenue 1

through Oakland and Shadyside,
according to the 1976 six year
development program released by
the Pittsburgh city planning
department yesterday.

i The development program calls

, for an expenditure of over $251

. million over the next six years for
capital improvements.

The Fifth Avenue reconstruction
is part of $27 million earmarked for
road repair.

The planning department study
is interested primarily in the
planned development of the city
and stresses Oakland and the
Golden Triangle as two areas of
concern. A study of the conﬂict
between the ethnic community and
the various institutions centered in
Oakland is recommended in the
plans, and future guidelines for
development of the section are
called for. L
, Under transit, the plan calls for
an extension of the Fifth Avenue
bus lane from Craft to Belleﬁeld
Avenues. That bus lane currently
stops at Craft. _

Oakland is not included in the
public safety category, although it

 

is suggested that new police and
ﬁre stations be erected in other
neighborhoods.

The six year program was called
an effort “to stimulate private
investment in the city” by the
ofﬁce of Mayor Pete Flaherty. The
Mayor’s office listed the goals of

the program as improving the

existing housing in the city,
providing quality community ser-
vices, expanding job opportunities
and strengthening the city’s tax
base.

Of the $251.2 million needed for
the planned improvements, 74% is
expected to come from federal,
state and private sources, the
Mayor's office said.

The plan calls for an extensive
system of bike routes to be erected
through the city, including Shady-
side, but not Oakland, and
improvements for the Schenley

Park recreation facilities and the   r  

Carnegie Library in Oakland.

The program also calls for
further efforts to clean up
Pittsburgh’s air pollution. In
Oakland, the average concentration
of suspended particulate matter
was reported as dropping from 138
micrograms per cubic meter in
1970 to 99 micrograms in 1975. The
federal government set 75 micro-
grams as the maximum long-term
level, with measurements above
that mark considered dangerous.

The sulphur dioxide concentra-
tion reportedly dropped from .050
per parts per million in 1970 to .020
parts per million in 1975.

A series of ﬁve public meetings
are planned to discuss the plans.
In Oakland, the public meeting will
be held at the Synod Hall, 125 N.
Craig; on Wednesday, September
29, at 7 p.m.

(This Is A Paid Po$ition)

BY RICH HARRY

The book security systems
located inside entrances to four Pitt
libraries have proven successful in
reducing theft to library materials,
a Hillman Library official said
Wednesday.

Director of University Libraries
Glenora Rossell said a random
inventory two years after installa-
tion of the system showed a loss of
only one book, compared to a 10%
loss of library materials before
installation in January 1974.

“We have every reason to
believe the system is successful,”
she said. The system is in
operation in Hillman, Langley,
Bevier (Benedum) and Falk librar-
ies. .
A grant from the Hillman
Foundation provided $53,000 to
install the system in Hillman. The
other devices totaled.$15,000 each.
Rossesll called the expense “well
worth it.

“Before we put the system in
Benedum, inventories showed loss-
es at a level of $27,000,” she said.
“But they’re ﬁnishing another

inventory now and I am optimistic
that losses will be low.”

Homer Bernhardt, head librarian
for the math and engineering
libraries, said yesterday the inven-
tory showed 84 items missing from
Bevier.

Rossell explained the missing
items were not due to a malfunction
of the book security system. “A
thief is a thief, and sometimes
there is no way to stop him.”

Despite the system’s apparent

success, Rossell pointed out the
system could not detect vandalism
to materials, and admitted it was
not foolproof. “A change in
temperature and humidity may
affect the system but we check it
every day and make certain it’s
working,” she said. '

Rossell refused to reveal how the
device functioned. “It is an
electronic system that locks a gate
and trigg'ers a warning bell

. whenever a person tries _to leave

the library with improperly charged
material,” she said.

Persons triggering the alarm are
reprimanded by the desk atten-
dants, but not ﬁned, Rossell said.

“The security system is for the
beneﬁt of the patrons. It protects
the items for the users,” Rossell
said.

MILK CUTS CANCER RISK

COLD SPRING HARBOR, N.Y.
(AP)—Drinking two glasses of milk
a day apparently cuts the risk of
getting stomach cancer, at least
among Japanese, says a researcher
from Tokyo.

It is one more bit of evidence for
the influence of ordinary foods in
either reducing or increasing the
chances of developing cancers.

Japan long had a high rate of
stomach cancer. But the death rate
- from it has dropped about one-third

since 1955 after a change,
beginning in 1919, to higher
consumption of milk and milk

products, and other western-type
foods, says Dr. Takeshi Hirayama
of the National Cancer Center
Research Institute in Tokyo.

THERAPY PROGRAM FUNDED
FOR HEALTH CENTER

The Richard King Mellon Foun-
dation has awarded a $200,000
grant to the University Health
Center of Pittsburgh for the
establishment of a therapeutic
recreation program.

The therapeutic recreation pro-
gram, believed to be the first such
program in Pennsylvania, will be
part of the division of physical
medicine,‘ department of ortho-
pedics, Children’s Hospital of
Pittsburgh and the Pitt School of
Medicine.

Typical therapeutic activities for
children with more common handi-
caps include: ball games, swim-
ming, canoeing, skating, bowling,
skiing and horseback riding, all of
which can be engaged in by most of

these children with appropriate
modiﬁcations.

  Officers Are Not Guards

One of the easiest ways to get a Pitt campus police officer mad is to
refer to him as a “guard.” The word “guard” usually brings to mind
old men in uniforms who stand outside supermarkets and retrieve
shopping carts. The word “guar ” does not reﬂect the extensive
traitning each campus police officer must go through prior to being put
on uty. ‘

The word guard does not reﬂect the fact that campus police oﬁicers
are licensed by the state of Pennsylvania and have the power of arrest.

Unfortunately, much of the Pitt community, including members of
the administration, persist in looking at the campus police force as little
more than night watchmen who just happen to also work during the
daytime. Other members of the Pitt administration have a
schizophrenic attitude to the campus police: On one hand, they want a
professional police force on campus, but on the other hand, they persist
in meddling into policy affairs. While the administration should keep a
close watch over the police department to insure that they operate in a
proper fashion, they Should reﬁain from treating the police force as
their private army, subject to their whims.

When charges of racism were brought against the campus police by
members of the black community last spring, the University set up a
commission to look into the matter. The study done by the commission
neither proved not disproved the charges. Some members of the
commission felt that the power of the campus police force should be
reduced and recommended the police forces’ blue uniforms, because
they looked too much like the uniforms of the city’ s police force, be
changed.

Itishardnottogettheimpressionthatsomemembersofthe
commission wanted to forget that the campus police oﬁicers are bona
ﬁde law enforcement officials and not just amateurs playing cops and
robbers. Furthermore, reducing the power of the campus police
departments seems _a rather severe way of dealing with the problem of .
racism.’ If some police officers are guilty of racism, they should be
dealt with harshly, but the eﬁectiveness of the entire force and the
protection they give to the Pit community should not be 

What the campus police force really needs is a clear set of guidelines

about the extent of its police power and duties. Police Lieutenant
Joseph Walker said he had never head a clear-cut deﬁnition of his
powers. “I don’t think anybody knows. The question is always shied
away from.”
. ‘Many times ofﬁcers are in doubt whether to act in certain situations
or call in city police. Fortunately, they usually act but the time wasted
and self doubt involved in deciding to act can only hinder an ofﬁcer’s
performance. Surely, no one can expect campus police officers to
ignore a criminal act that occurs on or near the Pitt campus even
though the crime has nothing to do with the University.

We feel that the campus police do a good job but there’s room for
improvement. Much of the improvement, however, lies not in the
police department but in the University administration that governs it.

Pitt by 7

_ Five years ago, persons betting on the Pitt football team tried to
guess not which team would win a particular game, but which game the
Panthers would win in the course ofa season. It was not much fun. i

That, happily, is no longer the case. A more appropriate bet this
season would seem to hinge on which the Panthers will lose, this
season, if any. ' '

The Blue and Gold is ranked as high as second in national pre-season
polls, and often above annual rivals Penn State and Notre Dame. Most
forecasts pick Pitt to ﬁnish as the top team in the East, ending Penn
State’s long reign in that position.

The school’s reputation is rising, the team is on national television
and there is an excellent chance for a bowl bid. Alumni contributions
are pouring in and Pitt students have something to cheer about on
Saturday afternoons.

All this is good. And it is no coincidence the change began to take
place four years ago, since that is when Pitt hired super-recruiter
Johrmy Majors to turn the program around. Majors took one of the
worst big-time programs in the country and in a few seasons turned it
into one of the best.

Pitt fans can look forward to this season, especially, since Majors’
ﬁrst group of recruits is now ready for their ﬁnal harvest. It is not

‘ impossible that the harvest could include twelve wins and Pitt’s ﬁrst

national championship since 1937 and Marshall Goldberg.

True, some of the undesirable byproducts of the sudden turn in Pitt
football fortunes, including Majors’ recent craving for secrecy and the
headline- grabbing misadventures of some of his players, are not to be
desired or condoned.‘

But Pitt fans should not let these reversable problems stop them
from enjoying a Pit win at South Bend tomorrow. We'll be watching
and we like the Panthers by seven.

in Florida for the year, and his secretary speaks in {
tones reminiscent of Bela Lugosi. V

It is a seller’s market, thanks in part to the lack of
decent dormitory space at Pitt, and the landlords,
know it. They know can charge’ just about anything,
and eventually get it, for just about any room or
closet near the Oakland area.

The students, who, after all, have to live
somewhere, gripe and scream at the secretaries and
their friends, but the landlord never hears.

Crime must be reduced, the deterioration of
buildings must be curtailed, and some sort of major .
renewal project must be undertaken to breath fresh ‘ V
air nto the stale environment. ' ‘ @

A minor improvement has come this summer from
the University. Two of its buildings on Oakland
Avenue, the subject of much criticism for their
condition, are currently being renovated. But other
landlords have little incentive to follow suit. ‘

Two short-range projects could help, however. “
One would be for the University, by itself or in
cooperation with PAT, to provide free or inexpensive
shuttle bus service to Shadyside, Squirrel Hill and
other nearby neighborhoods. Encouraging people to
live further away from Oakland would force the
landlords who monopolize business close to Pitt to
offer something better," or cheaper.

But that, too, will cost money that the University
appearently doesn’t have.

The other short-range solution lies inthe Legal
Awareness Committee of Student Government.

There was a day when the committee, along with the 
Pitt Tenant Union, had a secret list of realtors, V’/4"‘
_ranking them as good, bad or atrocious. The ’ /

rankings were based on a survey of a large portion of
students renting in the area. i .

When a landlord was fair, he prospered. When he
wasn’t, he found himself getting fewer and fewer
phone calls each summer. Eventually a few caught
on and shaped up.

Such a massive consumer revolt takes much time
and hard work. Someone has" to survey students and ‘
compile results.

And someone has to spread the word that the list
exists, and make sure people see it before signing
something they will regret. V -

It can be done, evidenced by the fact it was done
before, but not without a bit of uncharacteristic
leadership from students and rare hard work.

If something isn’t done, the cockroaches may
eventually win.

A Why Fraternities?

Fraternities help one to become
“the uncommon man.” They are
the last stronghold of independent

living in the highly organized
university and college where one’s

life is dominated by ‘university
activities. When the Fraternity
does its job well, it cannot be

outdone by the dormitory because
of the freedom and, more impor-
tantly, the responsibility it affords.

ll this image. is fulfilled
conscientiously by its members,

the fraternity grants to its members
more than is available to the

average man. A fraternity is an
adjunct to college and university

over when the university’s role

leaves off in the classroom. It is a
laboratory for life.

The fraternity is an experience in
living together and sharing main-
tenance, self government and

personal relations in a community
that proﬁts socially and intellec-
tually. The fraternity constitutes

the polish that a man desires in his
late ‘adolescent years. It teaches

social graces, leadership, prepara-
tions for a job, the signiﬁcance of

understanding other personalities
and of being with them, and the
ability to operate a household in the
preparation for a job, the signiﬁ-

cance of understanding other
personalities and of being with

one’s own life after college. The
member contributes service and is

taught to understand a truly
professional way of life after
college.

But the one great value in
fraternity membership, in which
many critics are singularly silent, is
Brotherhood—that intangible but
very real and very precious
heritage which provides the frater-
nity man with the opportunity to
develop close companionships and
life-long friendships-—the kind that
no other association can offer.
Time cannot efface nor distance

weaken this bond that unites these
men as Brothers.

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Those of you who have been in a
sweat in recent years over the
dismantling of our Emergency
Defense System can now relax.

One look at the many new
buildings gracing the Oakland
campus should graphically illus-
trate that our men and women in
the Cathedral have not forgotten

A the awesome (even inspiring)

possibility of nuclear war.

It ought to be clear that the
Forbes Complex structures, _while
serving as splendid classrooms and
nifty meeting places also will
double as bomb shelters when that
Fatal Hour comes, when that Final
Ululation trembles in the air and
when all those retired accountants
don lead coats to become ‘the
vanguard of the radioactive bri-
gadesq

Why else the grim, white walls?
Why else those small, thick

Pitt Prepared for Nuclear War

windows? Why else the enclosed
passageways between buildings?
Whoever designed our newest
buildings at Pitt obviously spent a
lot oftime studying the Maginot
Line. —

To go with these amazing
structures, the University has
developed a plan, of course, for the
event of nuclear war. It all falls
under the school’s mission of self
perpetuation.

The plan is coordinated with the
larger federal program called
Operation Monastery, for those
white-walled fortresses of learning
that preserved Western Civilization
during the reign of roving bands of
quarrelsome Norse, in the dimmest
parts of the Dark Ages.

It should be pointed out that the
plan is a mirror image to the
Limited Nuclear War option in the
top drawers of every Washington
psychopath.

The plan provides for Three
Stages of action following the first
warnings of imminent conflict from
the Pentagon. In the first stage,
tenured faculty, upper level ad-
ministrators and Golden Panthers
will be “invited” to a “reception”
in the new Law Building.

Massive stainless steel doors will
be rolled down over the deceptively
weak-looking windows,’ effectively
isolating the Elect from the rest of
the world. Internal atmosphere in
the Forbes Complex will be
pressurized to prevent contamina-
tion.

The Second Stage alert,_about
two days before the actual conflict,
will bring the Campus Police into
the picture, who will skip the
revolvers and nightsticks and load
up with automatic weapons,
grenade -launchers and other
military goodies kept on hand now
under the’ guise of the “ROTC
program" here.

An important sidelight to the
program is the role of the Primate

Research Center, a “former” Nike

Missle Base in a nearby county now
primed with anti-missle projectiles
to provide an umbrella for the
campus.

Elected members of the Univer-
sity Health Center also will be
brought down for entrance into the
now-dealed environment, as well
as selected undergraduate and
graduate students.

The Third Stage, bringing us to
within 20 hours of the public alert,
includes a fake development
project in South Oakland. A
contract for razing Atwood and

South Bouquet Streets will be,

activated, and the indigenous
population will rise to defend their
property against University en-
croachment.

This tidy diversion will prevent
any of them from realizing exactly
what is going on in the new Forbes
Complex.

Life inside the now-revealed
bunker will be quite pleasant, with
a plenty provision of victuals from
Central Food Services, Pittsburgh
Film-Makers films and guest
lectures to while away the time.

At some point, of course, the
City will be bombed, although the
direct hits will be limited because
of quick action on the part of the
Primate Research Center in strik-
ing down anything coming too
close.

The Campus Police will keep
order within and without the
Bunkers in the years following the
devastation of the city of Pitts-
burgh.

Lab animals, used to radioactiv-
ity after generation upon genera-
tion of scientiﬁc investigation, will
be brought out of their safe-keep-
ing in the basements of Scaife Hall
to repopulate the blasted areas.

After the radiation has died to a
significantly safe level, the hosts
within the Forbes Complex will

emerge, now perhaps one of the

best organized forces in the
country.

With undergraduate and grad-
uate students in abundance as a
cheap supply of labor and with
plenty of know-how, the "University
will blossom again as a center of
education, and Western Pennsyl-
vaniaiwill see a New Order of the
ages.

Of course, surviving members of

-the state legislature will find their ,

way to the campus, pleading for
help, ‘providing one of the most
heady moments of all.

They’ll be sorry they didn’t give
us more money last year.

The Pitt Inquisition

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Going up for tenure these days is
a traumatic experience in the least.
Candidates for this august award at
the University can be found in any
one of — the ill-lit bars in the
neighborhood, muttering to them-
selves.

What they mutter of are
friendships run ashore, broken
promises, birthday. cards not sent
and a million other personal beads
on the great abacus of departmen-
tal politics.

Ideally, a young faculty member
should be a brilliant worker in
whatever slice of human knowledge
he or she has deﬁned as his or her
own.

Besides original work, the
tenured-professor-to-be must also
be a good administrator. That is,
effective and productive on the
various committees, programs and
special sessions that make up the
academic life. ’

If possible, the faculty member
should be good with students.
Firm and unyielding to tales of
unexpected pregnancies around
ﬁnals time, yet popular with
students as an “all right guy,” or a
wonderful woman.

Not unsurprising, most are
driven mad by the juggling act.

So they mutter to themselves in
the back booth of some roach-
infested dive, spilt beer gleaming
on the table around them,
brooding.

The following is a sort of case
study of’ one faculty member,
facing up to his tenure decision:

DAY ONE: With a month to go,
gnawing doubts begin to peep in
through the tranquility that once
belonged to the subject, the the

. realization that the three-year

contract is "up, and the big
decision will be made shortly.

The ‘subject begins to take

No-Doz.
DAY TWO: A ﬂash of self-asser-
tiveness. So what if they don’t give

me tenure. I'll go somewhere else
and prove my genius. Conﬁdence
returns, and the subject takes only
two No-Doz as opposed to the
regular dose of four.

DAY THREE: A glance in a I

publication in the discipline reveals
that fellow travelers cannot ﬁnd
jobs and are starving. A grim tale
of cannabalism in the family of a
faculty member at Princeton,
rejected for tenure because of the
dress habits. Self-assertiveness
steals away.

DAY FOUR: Now popping
No-Doz at regular intervals, replac-
ing brandy for water in regular
diet. The anxiety grows. Were
they talking about him at the lunch
table at the Faculty Club? Why did
everyone laugh like that? How did
their teeth get so sharp?

DAY FIVE: An old lunch buddy,
Farnsnoot, one of the department
rabble rousers stops in the
subject’s ofﬁce to suggest a noon
get-together. The subject begins
the conversation amiably enough,
but as the talk goes on,
mysteriously begins to refer to the
other as Dr. Famsnoot, and ﬁnally
pretends they are entire strangers.

DAY SIX Subject hears an old

rumor that the man who really runs
things in the department is none
other than Farnsnoot. The
subject’s stomach clenches into a
know. He nearly passes out in his
Faculty Club beer.

DAY SEVEN: The subject
now spends as much time as
possible stone drunk. Stories in the
campus newspaper about cutbacks
in faculty numbers have an
astounding effect.,on the subject, a
convulsive muscular frenzy that
ends in a high-pitched giggle.

DAY EIGHT: Brooding over the
way of life’s misfortunes in a dark
bar, that subject is approached by a
prostitute. Alarmed, the subject
senses that somehow someone is
testing him. He shrieks for help,
and is thrown out on his face. He
cannot remember the rest of the
night,-but wakes, fully clothed, and
bleeding from three small wounds
on his left shoulder.

DAY NINE: In class, the
subject’s attention begins to
wander and reaches a point where
students in the back row can yell
obscenities in the subject’s unsee-
ing face. Two sophomores tie his
shoe laces together.

DAY TEN: The subject refuses

any kind of food other than fried
chicken. .

DAY ELEVEN: Sleepless, dop-
ed, drunk and starving, the subject
is called in for the ﬁrst interview for
the tenure proceedings. Five hits
of powerful speed enable him to
carry on a conversation. After the
interview, he returns to his ofﬁce
and slumps onto the floor.

DAY TWELVE: Now unshaven
and physically broken, the subject
returns home to his apartment,
pulls, down all the blinds and crawls
into bed. He then leaves the bed
thinking that's the first place They
would look, and curls up in the back
of a closet, hoping to be mistaken
for a laundry bag.

DAY THIRTEEN: Subject in a

light coma.
DAY FOURTEEN: A ﬂash of fear
at being labelled incompetent

goads the subject back to campus
to attend to classes. Dreams, when
sleep occurs, are almost entirely
m.ade up of large, bulging rats than
dance and sing in Latin. Subject
has occasional visions, mostly of
his mother and birthplace in New
Jersey.

DAY FIFTEEN: The subject is
awarded tenure by acclamation. It
is approved by the dean. The
subject is wracked by a crying jag
after which comes the calm
serenity and cool outlook so often
noted in tenured faculty and
survivors of the Spanish Inquisi-
tion.

Nuclear
War

(Continued from Page 5)

Of course, some will scoff at this

-plan, or the existance of anything

remotely like it. But can they
explain the University’s interest in
“cancer” research, or the high-
powered experts in radiology in the
institution? Why did University
professors do a study of the effect
of a nuclear war on Pittsburgh,
using the Cathedral of Learning as
ground zero?

Does any of this explain the
numbers of former military men in
high positions at Pitt? Or the size
of the University Campus Police
Force, one of the largest in the
entire county?

And the increasing numbers of
individuals turned down for tenure,
and the hiring freeze? Is it because
the Forbes Complex has already
reached maximum capacity?

And what about that feeble cover
story for the purchase of a
“former” Nike missle installation?
Raising monkeys?

Of course, the bunker-like aspect
of the Forbes Buildings ’ could
merely be the work of poor taste on
the part of state architects.

But that’s ridiculous.

CAS Cross Registration
In Films Phased Out

BY DEANNA LOUISE

College of Arts and Sciences
(CAS) students cannot cross-
register this semester for Pitts-
burgh F ilm-Makers courses offered
by the School of General Studies
(SGS) due to inadequate funding,
according to CAS Dean Robert D.
Marshall. I

Apparently, Marshall said, funds
have not been transferred from
CAS to General Studies to pay the
approximate $100-per-student fee
charged by the Pittsburgh Film-
Makers to finance the course. _

When the ﬁlm studies program
was instituted in 1973, CAS
allocated $2,400 to send 24
students in CAS 110 Independent
Study in Film to the Film-Makers
for instruction.

After that initial funding ran out,
CAS withdrew money for the
course, so SGS resurrected a ﬁlm
studies department with all courses
taught by the Pittsburgh Film-
Makers. ‘

The $40-per-credit fee paid by
SGS students was directly transfer-
red to the Film-Makers.

CAS students pay a ﬂat tuition
rate per term. Consequently,
confusion arose when CAS stu-

.dents cross-registered for the
Film-Makers courses now offered
by SGS.

Tuition in Arts and Sciences
cannot be directly transferred to
particular courses like it can be in
SGS.

According to Marshall, money is
not being transferred from CAS to
the SGS budget. And cross-regis-
tration will be prohibited until the
ﬁnancial problem is solved.

Carter Knocks GOP,

Promises Bright Future

( Continued from Page 1)
abortion stand, but no demonstra-
tion disrupted Carter's appear-
-ance.

At the rally, Carter charged that
Republican administrations have

consistently neglected problems ‘of-

health care, transportation, pollu-
tion and education.

“The decay of our neighbor-
hoodsis due to an improperly
managed and insensitive federal
government,” he said. “If you
elect me, I guarantee I can‘help
solve your problem.”

Carter attacked the Republicans
for “backbreaking federal budget
deﬁcits and rising unemployment.
Unemployment is. three times as
high as when Kennedy was in
office,” Carter said.

Carter promised his administra-
tion would seek tax reform to make
corporations share the country’s
tax burdens.‘

“I’ve never depended on power-
ful political interests to put me in
office. I owe everything to the
people,’ Carter said before leaving
Pittsburgh.

GENERAL STUDIES PARKING

Beginning September 13, the
University parking ofﬁce will offer
night parking for students attend-
ing evening classes at the rate of
$10 per term.

To facilitate the application
process, interested students can_
apply during the School of General
Studies orientation in the Cathedral

BY TOM WASELESKI

. For Pitt’s Student Government
Board (SGB), which closed out last
April with anything but a typical
term, it will be business as usual
next Tuesday night when weekly
meetings resume.

Ushered in an election last
J anuaryriddled with improprieties,
then coming under the gun of a
new tuition hike, Board president
Barry Weisband is looking forward
to working on some less caustic
issues the second half of his term.

His priorities stack up to a
fulﬁllment of his chief campaign
pledges: total revision of the SGB
constitution, establishment of a
campus food co-op and preparation
for future tuition crises.

‘‘I’m hoping for a complete
revamping of the whole student
government structure to head off
the tendency to lose participation
from various representative
groups, ” Weisband said.

“The changes will come up for
referendum in J anuary’s election, ’ ’
he said.

tivity of the Commuter Association,
which prompted the Committee for

Once again this fall, an overﬂow
of students have applied for
dormitory housing, according to
Housing Director Don Hughes.

Just like every year in recent
memory, an increased number of

Pitt’s upperclassmen have elected‘

to live in the residence halls rather
than move off campus.

This month, 3,556 spaces are
available for students on campus,
with additional accommodations for
150 others at nearly .Webster Hall.
Hughes stressed, however, that

ters may help out,” he said.

Weisband expressed optimism

for resuming the campus food
co-op, which operated for ﬁve
weeks this summer.

“We ﬁlled 300 orders and tried

to work out the kinks with the
accounting,” he said. “Eventually
this year, we’d like ‘to expand with
canned good, records and music
paraphernalia.”

Weisband said, however, no

location or opening date for the
co-op has been set.

Weisband also expressed an
interest in making contacts in the
state legislature and University
administration who would be
helpful in a tuition hike situation.
He has contended numerous times
that the Board’s preoccupation
with last year’s election appeals
made them ill-prepared to confront
the tuition issue.

With Student Government elec-
tions and the University’s tuition
deliberations safely a term away,
the Weisband Board has an
opportunity to check out the

I eleventh-hour strategies and get

down to some conventional
bureaucracy.

Computer Center
Tackles Student

BY SHIREEN IRANI

The computer center has tackled
student abuse of computers by
forming a code of conduct to outline
the responsibilities of computer
users.

Through the University student
judicial system, the computer
center will take steps against
anyone suspected of breaking the
code, available to students in a
recently published pamphlet.

The pamphlet ‘specified the
nature of an infraction and the
resulting judicial process.

Computer tie is a scarce
resource, according to Ted Dough-
erty, manager of the computer
center.

The computer center allocates its

limited supply of computer time to .

users from departments all over
campus at $75 per unit. According
to the pamphlet, because computer

 

Abuse of System

resources are so limited, the results
of action against abusers lean range
from a disciplinary warning to
dismissal.

Everyone has a different code
number and password for logging
into the computer. According to
Dougherty, some computer users
obtain other students’ codes and
passwords and illegally use their
time.

Some students have also acquir-
ed the numbers to reach important
data stored in the computers.
Student tampering has resulted in
the erasure of several research
tapes.

Before the code was effected, the
computer center has no set policy
of action. Only the party offended
by the abuser had the power to
prosecute.

Now any code breakers will face
a judicial procedure initiated by the
computer center.

ARTS

Taylor Loses What Carly Gains

BY TOM WASELESKI

In the Pocket, James Taylor
Warner Brothers, 0698.

Well, James Taylor has ﬁnally
fallen victim to it. ‘

We’ve watched Paul McCartney
swiftly disintegrate from a major
musical force. And there are many
who will argue that Lennon's
demise came about from the same
malady.

Now sweet baby James is but a
shadow of his former poignant self,
and who" can say that it’s not the
result of just another artist’s
mellowing out, like Lennon and
McCartney, .after the first few
years of wedded, familial—shall we
dare say it-—“bliss?”

Taylor’s career hasbeen marked
by a string of beautiful, changing
albums. Beginning with the
restless country loner and spanning
the moods and miles it takes to get
to , the progressive city dweller,
Taylor was" given us a full and too
oftentruthful portrait of ourselves.

Chronologically ‘his records re-
felect the consciousness of the

youthful fans that follow him and .

his beat. In the late 60s when
students were given to wandering
with little more than the sun on
their shoulders and a straw in their
mouths, Taylor was offering “Fire
and Rain,” “County Roads,” and
‘-‘Highway Song," by now folk—rock
standards.

In a period when all things are

-taking on a mere conservative

posture, we find Taylor settling
into routine tunes about fatherhood
and marital inﬁdelity. That's

_where he left off on his previous

album Gorilla. V

What makes Taylor’s latest so
disappointing are several things.

First, hackneyed themes. Just
about everyone making a mint in
the music business has written or
sung a lament concerning the
wretched green stuff, so it’s sheer
imitation for the sake of ﬂattering
his contemporaries when Taylor
cuts a song like “Money Mach-
ine.” Then, of course, there’s
“Family Man,” the old walkin’
man credo now that he has a wife
and (so the song says) a “second
mortgage.”

Second, bland melodies. Taylor
is usually strong and fresh in
penning notes that do all those

thrilling things like send shivers
down the spine and give vent to
one’s pent up emotions. And when
he can’t be exciting, he’s at least
subtle and warmly coy. “Shower
the People," his latest single,
sounds like a reprise from
“Mexico” (the Gorilla album). “A
Junkie’s Lament,” despite the

affirmed talents of Art Garfunkel
and Carly Simon, is polluted with .a
dragging harmony of la-la-las.
Then there’s the overall lack of
good instrumental backup. Though
Taylor's using the same personnel,
he doesn’t give them much of a role

   

   

to play this time around.
And now for the good news.
Tracks 6, 10 and 12.
“Daddy’s All Gone” is‘
oozing, humid cut about the singer
who can’t go on just one more time

an-

and so stays holding the phone with
half the road show left. The guitars
are particularly good here, and
particularly simple with just Taylor
and Danny “Kootch" Kortchmar
on electrics and Clarence Mc-
Donald on a Fender Rhodes.

David Crosby and Graham Nash
sit in for a worthwhile stint on
“Nothing Like a Hundred Miles,”
a bitter version of the guy on
“Daddys All Gone.” Taylor here,
shineson his acoustic.

“Golden Moments,” the final
track, sounds like something from

the lightly melancholic album
Walking Man. Notice how the
good cuts are about the loner once
again. Taylor is at his best either
writing like one or writingabout

Another Passenger, Carly Simon
Electra Records, 7E-1064

With all herneurotic fear of
upstaging husband James’ musical
genius, Carly Simon has a helluva
lot to worry about with the release
of a long-‘playing materpiece like
Another Passenger.

James Taylor has“ been getting
consistently trivial in his pop
songs, and his latest offering, In
the Pocket, released at the same
time as Carly’s new one, makes
this fact especially evident.

His wife, painfully aware of he

 

silly neurosis, may never get over
their healthy artistic competition
until she once and for all eclipses
one of his releases with a superior
one of her own.

Whether she likes it or not, it’s
happened here.

Another Passenger is just the
type of sophisticated album we’ve
hoped would come from an artist in
the later -60s/early -70s mold, an
album full of thought, audio
expertise and over all maturi_ty.It

- stands tall with Justin Hayward

and John Lodge’s Bluejays as one
of the most ﬁnely produced records
in recent years. And like Bluejays,
Another Passenger is likely to
receive little air play, since radio
these days seems little ‘concerned
with good music.

Produced by Ted Templeman,
Carly’s latest is loaded with
delicious sounds, from the tinkling
piano in “Darkness Til Dawn,”
which sounds like wind chimes, to
the thundering drum in “It Keeps

You Runnin’,” which has a quality

not unlike Ringo banging away in
“Sgt. Pepper.”

A couple of tracks on which she
collaborates with old friend Jacob
Brackman harken back to her
earlier records. “Riverboat Gam-
bler” is a ballad like “The Carter
Family" from No Secrets, and
“Half a Chance” is a strong tune
similar to “Haven’t Got Time for
the Pain,” which the pair wrote for
the Hotcakes album.

‘ ‘Dishonest Modesty” is lyrically
attuned to "‘You’re So Vain,” but
the instrumental backup borrows
from the funkier country side, as
Paul Barrere whines away on slide
guitar. Alex Taylor's resonant
backup vocal lends itself to
barefootin’ down some backwoods
path.

 Also strong on the instrumental
side is “Cow Town,” where
Barrere again turns in some good
licks. Carly’s soaring voice on the
chorus (“...Now it’s a cow town,
it’s a cow town...”) goes great in
front of some squeaky-tight guitar
riffs and particularly hard drum-
ming. I

For those who like the sensuality
of the Playing Possum album, she
serves up “He Like To Roll,” an
ever-so-slightly Latin cut that’ll get
you doing a rumba, if not fog up

your reading glasses. 6

V She follows this with one -of the
clearest, strongest vocals she’s
ever recorded, “In Times When
My Head.” There’s little backup
so the sincerity in her voice can
shine through, and does it shine!
The best cut she saves for just

about last, and if some misfortune '

should tragically cut short Carly's

career, this would surely be her
crownin g achievement. “Libby, ’ ’
named for the friend it was written
about, contains the phrase that has
become the record’s beautifully
succinct title: “...I’m just another
passenger/Traveling on these
crazy high seas/ Very likely. be the
same/ In a Paris breeze...”
Backed by strings and wood-
winds plus her own electric piano,
she sounds fuller than ever, she
takes her time and allows the song

to take its course so that it sounds
smoothly natural. The slow,

throbbing pulse of the tune makes
it flow majestically first through
one’s ears, then to the heart where
the rest of the album has already
been waiting; —

Rainbow Raises

Embalmed Paranoia

BY M. PATRICK MONAHAN

Rainbow Rising
BIackmore’s Rainbow-Oyster,
1-1601.

Rainbow Rising, the second
album from Blackmore’s Rainbow,
is a muddled blend of British heavy
metal and that pleasant topic
known and loved by us all: 16th
century evil.

As a result of this half-baked
formula, the album teases but
never fully releases the hard rock
beast from within.

Lead guitarist Ritchie Blackmore
calist Ronnie ' he

 

foreplay) have embalmed four of
the six songs on the album with
their ridiculous versions of gothic
paranoia.

The opening cut on side one,
“Tarot Women,” starts off with an
eerie, spellbinding synthejizer
passage by keyboardist Tony Cary,
but quickly ﬁzzles when’ Dio starts
raving about a mentally castrating
old gypsy. “Run with the Wolf” is
heavy handed sludge concerning

       
   

“Stargazer" and “A Light in the
Black" are off-the-wall tales of
demons and wizards.

Rainbow violates continually on
these mindless ditties. The
instrumentation is lumbering
heavy metal: grinding guitars and
demented screams are stacked on
top of an avalanche of bass and
drums. This technique can become
annoying but seldom offensive.
It’s the lyrics which induce the
vomiting.

A typical line from “Stargazer”
—“We built a tower of stone/ With
our ﬂesh and bone/To see him
fly/But we don't know why/Now
where do we go”, and from “Run
with the Wolf,” “There’s a hole in
the sky/Something evil passing
by/Beware, beware, run with the
Wolf.” Come on fellas, who’s
fooling who?

The two saving graces on the
album are “Starstruck” and “Do
You Close Your Eyes (When Your
Making Love). Admittedly, both
are mindless in content, (“Star-
struck” concerns itself » with a
starry-eyed groupie, while the
latter is self explanatory) yet the
instrumentation borders on brilli-
ant.

On “Starstruck,” drummer Cozy
Powell's deliberate snare rolls and
cymbal crashes become the lead
instrument, while Blackmore con-
tents himself with screeching
power chords. In addition, Dio
chips in with some well-times
howls, to combine for one of the
most dynamic hard rock songs of
the year.

“Do You Close Your Eyes” is
similar in format. but the atmos-

It was back in 1973 that a new
and unique sound called reggae
(pronounced reg-gay) began creep-
ing into the American music scene.

Paul Simon was the first to
borrow the reggae sound when he
traveled to Jamaica to record
"Mother and Child Reunion,"

which instantly became a smash

hit. A rash of popular recording
artists began cashing in on’ the
surging reggae sound, including
Paul McCartney, The Rolling
Stones, Led -Zeppelin and Stevie
Wonder. When Eric Clapton
reached No. 1 with his brilliant
version of Bob Mar1ey’s “I Shot
The Sheriff,” the stage was set for
this West Indian shuffle ’n soul
called reggae.

Today, reggae has attracted a
large following and more and more
records by Jamaican groups are
released. Bob Marley and the
Wailers are still the ‘most popular
the reggae groups, but there are
several other groups worth men-
tioning: The Heptones; Burning
Spear; Toots and The Maytals and
Peter Tosh.

Friday, September 10, 1976——THE PITTNEWS-—Page 11_._

Where From, Reggae Sound?

Although reggae's following is
spreading to a wider audience,
most people are still unfamiliar
with its origins. Reggae ﬁrst
surfaced in Jamaica in the mid-’60s
and its sound was a hybrid of the
Jamaican rhythms know as “ska"
and “rock steady."

Reggae also has strong over-
tones of calypso, rhythm and blues,
gospel and jazz. The term
“reggae" comes from the song
"Do The Reggay" by Toots and
The Maytals, which was recorded
in 1968. Fred “Toots” Hibbert
wrote the song, but cannot
remember where he picked up the
word.

Each reggae group has its own
style and approach. Bob Marley
and the Wailers’ music makes a

Breezin’
George Benson
Warner Bros. BS 2919

George Benson has struck gold
with his recent release, Breezin’. A
top name in jazz for years, Benson
is considered one of the most gifted
guitarist alive. Despite this, and
like so many other talented
jazzmen, he never has achieved
much commercial success.

Things have changed for him.
breezin’ is atop-selling album, and
Benson’s name is no longer
restricted to jazz circles alone.

Ironically, this latest is not his
best. Breezin is nothing more than
classy disco music. The music on

commentary on society and calls for

. a revolution. Marley is a political
force in Jamaica and he warns his
people that they cannot trust
politicians. .

Unlike Marley's music, Toots
and The Maytals’ recordings are
mainly apolitical. Their sound is
soulful and often tells about their
struggle to make it in the recording
business. The Heptones are the top
vocal group in Jamaica and have

been labeled the “Jamaican Beach
Boys."

Another successful reggae artist
is Peter. Tosh. one of the original
Wailers. His latest album, Legalize
It. contains some of the most
tasteful reggae tunes yet.

The Reggae Sound

/Continued from Page II)

The recent success of reggae is
the result of many hardworking and
devoted musicians who have grown
up in the wretched ghettos of
Kingston, Jamaica, and have paid

more than their share of dues.
Marley. with his dreadlocks and

Jamaican accent, has become an
international star and has changed

the image of the average Jamaican
dread-in—the-street. He sums up

his feelings on the song. “Roots.

Rock. Reggae," as he sings:

“Play I on the R&B

Want all my people to see

We bubbling on the Top 100

Just like a Mighty Dread."

Bob Marley and the other
Jamaican groups have every right
to gleam with pride. Reggae has
had the most powerful impact on
popular music since the recent
disco—craze began. If the trend
continues reggae may soon become
a household term.

BY STEVE SYBERT

Johnny Majors and his Pitt
Panthers aren’t about to take Notre"
Dame lightly. No team should.
The Fighting Irish may seem like
just an average team this year, yet

they are still making everyone’s‘

Top Twenty preseason polls.
Following in the tradition of
Knjte Rockne, Frank Leahy and the
Golden Dome, the Irish are out to
improve on last season’s 8-3

record, which, by Notre Dame

standards, just doesn’t take the
grade. And the upstart Panthers,

rated as high as second in the
preseason period of fearless
picking by the writers, will meet
the Irish in their first stumbling
block in what many consider will be
the finest Pitt season ever.

L But it's not going to be easy for
the Panthers. The Irish, who hold a
29-12 edge in a series which dates
back to 1911, are nearly unbeatable
in opening day contests, having
dropped only three season starters
since the turn of the century, the
last downfall coming in 1963
against Wisconsin. - And with

.nearly 60,000 die-hard fans at
South Bend, plus thousands of

offense that will feature more passing
Panthers did last year, a point illustrated here by the

   

than the

Notre Dame fans all across the
nation watching on the tube, the
Irish will have plenty of support.

For the first time in many years,
the Irish may need it. The loss of
12 lettermen from last season,
including seven regulars, four on
offense and three on defense,
severely affected areas such as the
offensive and defensive lines. _

Yet second-year coach Dan
Devine isn’t overly concerned,
though he has been under pressure
for going “only 8-3" in 1975.-

“At this point, we’re consider-
ably better than last year,” Devine
said. “We’re probably a better

Chuck Bonasorte Back--Again

BY RON SIEGEL

As Johnny Majors begins his
fourth year of coachingpat Pitt, he is
surrounded by his own recruits,
players who have known nothing
but winning seasons. Only one
current Panther lived through the
darkness and hopelessness of Carl
Depasq_ua's dismal 1-10 -1972
season. _

That player is-Chuck Bonasorte,
nicknamed the “Kamikase Kid”

four years ago for his reckless

specialty team play. Bonasorte has
tasted victory and defeat. and has a
heavy preference for the former.

Phillies Win,
  Now Lead
Pirates By 5

PHILADELPHIA (AP)—The
slump-ridden Philadelphia Phillies,
buoyed by a one-minute standing
ovation on their return home from a
disastrous road trip, beat the
Chicago Cubs 4-2 Thursday night
with the help of a walk, ‘an error
and a passed ball in a four-run
second inning.

The Phillies, losers of 11 of their
previous 12 games, raised their
lead over idle Pittsburgh in the
National League East to five games
behind Jim Lonborg's seven-hit
pitching.

I In the past two weeks, the Pillies
had seen their 15‘/2-game lead of
Aug. 24 reduced to 4‘/2 games.

Torn ligaments forced Chuck to
take a redshirt during Majors" first
season here, and this left Bona-
sorte with a year of eligibility when
the last of Depasqua’s other

recruits were gone.

“If this team was going to be
0-5." he said from his room at
Pitt’s Johnstown training camp, “I
wouldn't be here. But we have a
shot at the national champion-

. ship." .

Told he was too small, at 170
pounds. to even play defensive
back for Depasqua, ‘he has
discovered that quickness and

- agility fit in just finejwith Majors’

plans. Although unable to crack the
defensive lineup for substantial
play. Bonasorte has become
perhaps the most valuable player
on Pitt's speeialty‘teams. This suits
the Hazelwood native just fine.

“Coach Majors loves the special
teams,” he said. “Tony Dorsett
has to run the ball, the quarter-
backs have their job, and I have
mine. My job is as important to me
as their jobs are to them.

"The public doesn't know about __
you. but that doesn't matter. If you
play on all the special teams.
you're playing a lot. and you get a
chance to make a big play."

Bonasorte did just that in Pitt's
opening-game l9-9 victory over
Cotton Bowl-bound Georgia last
season by causing a crucial fumble
which teammate Bob Jury pounced
on to set up a Panther touchdownj

He picked up his nickname
because ofhis ferocious hits, which
lrequently knocked players out of
games. Teammates were not
immune. and several were his first
victims.

Majors stresses more than raw
speed. ‘however. “He goes for
speed. quickness and technique."

said Bonasorte. “We technique
'em to death."

A Pittsburgher all his life,‘
Bonasorte has grown up with the
Pitt-Penn State rivalry. His first-
wish for the coming season is to
beat the Nittany Lions. Winning a
national championship comes se-
cond.

Bonasorte also has a score ‘of
sorts to settle with Notre Dame. In
the game two years ago at South
Bend an Irish player punched
Chuck in the head, whereupon
teammate Larry Felton came to his
rescue. Felton was attacked after
the game in the-tunnel leading to
the locker room.

“That kinda stuff has to stay on
the field," he’ said. “Dorsett’s-
been hit with cheap shots a lot. and
he never wanted to fight the kid.”

Charging down the field and
smashing into opponents is brutal,
but for Chuck Bonasorte, it's just
his’ way of contributing to a
championship football team. I

end Irish  

football team now than we were at
the end of last season.”

I But at the end of last season, the
Panthers were better than the Irish
as seen in the memorable 34-20
conquest at Pitt Stadium, where
Tony Dorsett put on one of the
greatest collegiate performances
ever in rambling for 303 yards
rushing and an additional 74 in
receptions. And for Pitt, the roles
are nearly unchanged (22 starters
returned from last season’s 8-4
squad), while Notre Dame has had
to fill in several young players in
key positions, moves which are
bound to pay off in a year or two.

Most of the nation-will be glued
to their television sets to see if
Dorsett can stage an encore. The
prime candidate for this year’s
Heisman Trophy has already
collected more yards in a career
(573) against the Irish than any
other player.

Though three members of the
Notre Dame front four will be
returning, Pitt runners won’t have
to peer up at the smiling face of
All-America tackle Steve Niehaus,
who was lost to graduation. Trying
to hold down the Pitt speedsters
will be ends Ross Browner and
Willie Fry, both juniors, while
junior Jeff Weston and sophomore

Mike Calhoun will take on inside
duties.

Starting at the outside linebacker
slots will be Steve Heimkreiter and
Doug Becker, while Bob Golic will
patrol the middle for the lineback-
ing corps, which is solid in
experience. Luther Bradley heads
the secondary, which was strength-
ened this season by the addition of
fullback Jim Browner, one of the
team’s leading ground-gainers a
year ago.

Devine maintains the situation is
bright for his defensive corps, but
can’t say the same for the offensive
line, where junior guard Ernie
Hughes is the only returning vet.
His blocking mates will be guard

ibis Time, It's  
Pitt With Stake  

BY CRIS HALL

Every Pitt-Notre Dame foot-
ball game played in the past twelve
years has affected the national
rankings. The usual reason: Aloss
to the lowly Panthers would have
knocked Notre Dame down several
notches from a Top Ten position.

This year, however,‘ it is the
Panthers who have a Top Ten
ranking to protect and, if the major
pre-season polls are a good
barometer, a national champion-
ship to strive for. 4

Notre Dame has been in the
United Press International coaches’
final Top Twenty every year since
1963, which was the last time Pitt
had defeated the Irish before last
season. Last season was the first in
time in twelve years the Irish failed
to crack the Associated Press
writers’ ﬁnal Top Twenty_following
Pitt's 34-20 victory at Pitt Stadium.

The last time Pitt was able to
reach the wire services’ final Top
Tens was in 1963, the last time
Notre Dame was shut out of both
Top Twenties. The Panthers were
ranked third by UPI and fourth by
AF after a 9-1 season.

But the tide has turned of. late,
much to the delight of Pitt
partisans, and Pitt is enjoying
pre-season rankings high among

the nation's top teams. The Blue
and Gold is ranked as high as
second in the country, and in.
almost every poll is picked to finish
higherthan either Notre Dame‘ or
Penn State, the two toughest teams
on Pitt’s 1976 schedule.

GamePlan magazine's estima-
tion of the Panthers’ strength
places Pitt in a position to which
they have been unaccustomed to
recently—second in ‘the country
(behind Michigan). jg GamePIan
picks Pitt opponents Notre Dame,
Penn State and Georgia Tech to
finish ninth, 18th and 20th
respectively.

Playboy is not as high on Johnny
Majors’ team, but it's not down on
it either. Playboy prognosticator
Anson Mount, one of the‘ first to
join the Tony Dorsett bandwagon,
rates Pitt fourth in the country.
Notre Dame and Penn State are
ninth and tenth, respectively, in
the Playboy forecast.

Both wire services place the
Panthers in the Top Twenty. UPI’s
coaches rank Pitt tenth, and AP’s
writers place the Panthers ninth.
Penn State is ranked ninth by UPI
and tenth by AP, and the Irish are
picked 11th by AP and 13th by UPI.

Street and Smith’s pre-season
picks include Notre Dame in the
No. seven slot, Pitt at No. 12 and
Penn ‘State at No. 14.

Pitt is expected to defeat Penn
State and wind up tops in the East
by GamePlan. Street and Smith’s,
Playboy, AP and the sponsors of
the Cool-Ray Cup, a recently
instituted trophy emblematic of
Eastern supremacy.

Pitt also has six members on
Cool-Ray’s all-East team, com-
posed of players from Eastern
independents. Split end Gordon
Jones, guard Tom Brzoza, Quar-
terback Bob Haygood and running
backs Tony Dorsett and Elliott
Walker are on Cool-Ray’s first
team offense and Panther Al

Romano is a member of the

ﬁrst-team defense line.

sive tackle Don Parrish and
lineback Arnie Weatherington are
given honorable mention by Cool-
ray.

Bemis ’ Boo ters
Look To Youth

BY JIM LEWIS

Pitt soccer Coach Leo Bemis has
Ponce de Leon turning in his grave.
It seems he has found what the
famous explorer searched for all his
life——the Fountain of Youth.

Last year, the Pitt soccer team
boasted a 5-7-2 record despite a
vast chunk of freshmen and
sophomores in their starting
lineup. These young players
performed quite well in the
Panthers’ up-again-down-again
season and held their opposition to
an impressive sixteen goals in
fourteen games, including four
shutouts.

This year, the Pitt starting squad
has an almost equal amount of
underclassmen as a year ago.

“I hear about them when they’re

, in high school, or discover they’re

interested in Pitt, and follow up on
them,” Bemis explained. “But I
don’t recruit them with a lot of
money. I don’t have it.”

That’s true. Pitt doesn’t dish out
hoards of money to prospective
soccer superstars, and so ends up
losing the interest of promising
Peles who are trying to decide at
which college they'd like to play.

But despite that adversity, Pitt,
with a ton of help from Bemis (now
in his 24th year as head soccer
coach), and an equal effort from his
players, turns out a very credible
soccer machine.

Take last year. The Panthers were
made up of three starting freshmen

——two backs and one lineman—but

still had satisfying moments
against Akron (0-0 tie), Davis and
Elkins (1-1 tie), and Indiana (2-0
victory).

This year, prior to Saturday
afternoon’s game with 10th-ranked
Akron in Ohio, Pitt will be starting
three freshmen—Rich Roccon and
Tom Wawrousek on the front line,
and Karl Nigh at middle lineback-
er. Along with the amazingly
young squad of seniors Kim Blasko
and Tom Murphy, junior Frank

Bucci, sophomores Craig Connolly,
Marty Moyer, Mark Nigh, Tim
Pearson and Irwin Siegel, the.
Panthers colud have the youngest
team in their NCAA Pennsylvania-
New Jersey-Delaware Division.

And if they faulter, waiting in the
wings are Fred Dohrmann, Hector
Garcia, Steve Harrison, Jerry
Tomassetti, Dan Wasson, Alfredo
Woodman, Randy Gyory and a host
of others.

A fairly—you guessed it——young
lineup.

But how good are they? Isn’t a
young team bound to make mental
mistakes and suffer a dismal
season?

“This year, our freshmen are as
good as the freshmen last year,”
claimed Bemis. “We don’t have a

player on the Notre Dame squad.

The Irish, who are starting only
three seniors, will line up with two
veterans in the backﬁeld with
quarterback Rick Slager and
halfback Mark McLane. Sopho-
more fullback Jerome Heavens,
who rushed for 756 yards as a
freshman, and Al Hunter, a junior
speedster, round out the running
game.

Also ﬁguring in the Notre Dame
offense will be end Ken McAfee,
an All-America selection last

performance of 26 cathches and
ﬁve touchdowns in 1975.

“We feel that Pitt is one of the
top five teams in the country,"
Devine said. “If we could beat
Pitt, it would give us a great
psychological lift.”

The outcome may rest on the
kicking game of the two teams,
which will be ﬁelding four of the
top booters in the country. Pitt will
be placing its hopes on the toes of
Carson Long and Larry Swider,
who boasts a 41-yard average.

“Last year he made second team
on the All Pa.-N.J.-Del. soccer
squad. In this area, Bucci is
regarded as one of the best."

But despite all these plusses,
Bemis is wary of tomorrow's battle
in the Buckeye State.

“The potential is there,” Bemis

, said. ‘It’s a matter of playing a
total game-—both offensively and
defensively. We’ll have to see.”
