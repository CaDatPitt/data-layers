Iconoclastic IvVrz'ter
Makes Little Delt Boy
Feel ‘Awful Bad’

By HERBERT RACKOFF
I’m sorry, Dan Cannon, sorry

 the devil.

Dan Cannon is the Delt,
Donora bred, who approached
me wistfully Friday afternoon.
He must be green, because he
reproached me with: “Herb, you’re
destroying all my illusions.”

But it’s all true, Dan, and that
bit about last year’s election ﬁasco
is the truest of all. As far as sell-
ing out for a dance chairmanship
is concerned, however, that's not
nearly solikely as it once was, be-
cause dance chairmanships just
'aren’t handed out like that today.

Of course there’s still plenty of
gravy to be passed around. Still,
the exec committee was sincere, I
believe, when they tried hard to
get someone else to seek the Senior
Announcements job before they
had to give it to Prexy Rose’s Dent
candidate, George Clifton. And if
top Deltman John Cheffey didn’t
have much competition in gather-
ing in the Spring Festival post,
you can’t blame the powers of
SFA for that.

There’s Still Hope, Dan

So don’t lose all your illusions,
.Dan. There’s still some place on
campus for the common man.
Seek and ye shall ﬁnd!

Nevertheless I don’t have to dig
very deeply into my memory to
discover a situation where the
gravy bowl was somewhat more of
a closed corporation. It was just
about this time two years ago. Bill
Harvey, Delt head, (the Delts cer-
tainly get the play (today, don’t
they?) was president of SFA, and
Chuck Ebert, Independent tycoon,
was on the exec committee.

With that set-up, things came
easy. Ebert wanted the Senior
Ball chairmanship, so he could get
Ginny Sepp’s picture in The News,
while Al Dixon, Big Delt on Cam-
pus, hankered after Senior An-
‘nouncements (lots of headache,
but a tidy commission). Harvey,
now, was a’ man who Wouldn’t
stand on formalities, and the deal
was consummated with grace and
dispatch.

It’s not done that way, today,
probably‘ because the faculty-ad-
ministration element has begun to
recognize that politics can, and,
unless I’m wasting my time, really
do exist.

Today ’ s Harangue

In case you haven’t drawn a
conclusion by now, Dannie, it’s
this: without the gravy, Pitt poli-
tics wouldn-’t' amount to a Tinker’s;
and without politics, _this campus
would be an awfully dull place in
the spring.

That point established, let’s get
back. toythei subject of today’s
harangue: elections and election
procedure.

Out of 60 nominees, 30 are elect-
ed, and you can only vote for six.
Thus, even a small group, through
concentrated effort, can elect a
portion of one slate, and, at the
same time, a large group of voters
must apportion their votes cor-
rectly in orderinot to waste their
ballots.

Obviously, when ﬁve slates
must, be elected, at least six or
seven sets of campaigners will be
pushing slates. That this creates
a violent campaign needs no proof.
That it puts an organized group
like the fraternities at an advan-
tage becomes apparent upon scru-
tiny, since Independent votes will
tend to ﬂood the Independent stal-
warts at the expense of the lesser
lights, while the more closely—or-
ganized Greeks can spread their
votes where they are most needed.

Current Biclzerings

Now let’s take a quick glance or
two at the battle lines as they look
this morning:

1. Les Hamburg got back from
Florida yesterday, if he didn’t
drive the way he usually does.
(This is more important than
some of you birds seem to
think.)

2. The Zeta Tau Alphas (ZTA’s
from now on) and the Tri-
Delts have swung their sym-
pathies to the Independents.

3. The engineers appear less of
an Independent hope than
ever before, since Boss Bill
McQuade is no longer with
them.

4. The catch in the Independent
plans is that everybody wants
to run with the dents, and the
non-fraternity boys must elect

- at least 2% slates to get any-
' where.

5. Ernie Rose insists on an ex-
ecutive committeeman from
Dent school, probably Frank
Widney; Al Kairys insists that
he be put on the committee;
and Bernie McKenna wants
to ‘be president. They can
only elect three, however, and
one of these must be a wom-
an. -‘We have -an answer to‘:
this enigma, but we're saving
it for our next.

News Holds
Pre-Easter

Style Show

Reich Announces
Spring Showing
Of New Fashions ,

In spring a young ma.n’s fan-
cy turns to love, and the fancy
of ‘The Pitt News turns to a
style show. Everybody already
beingyin love, Jay Reich, busi-

ness manager, of The News, has I

turned to the style show.
According to Reich, the style
show will be held two weeks from
today, the afternoon of April 11.
Balloting for models begins today,
and continues through this Wed-'
nesday. A bal-
lot box will be
placed on the
ground floor of
the Cathedral.
“The s t y l e
show was so
successful in the
f a l I , ’ ’ s a i d
Reich, “that we
decided to hold
a repeat show.
For this show
we will have
the Easter fash-
ion in men and
women’s clothes displayed by the
latest in campus beauty and man-
liness. But be sure to cast your
vote for your favorite Myrna Loy

 

Jay Reich

or Clark Gable among the stu-.

dents.”

The Pitt News Style Show is of
long tradition around these parts.
As far as is known it goes back
even further than the regime of
Ellis Tumpson. The News held
two style shows a year that were
free and always bigger than ever
before.

Athens Marble
Will Decorate

Greek Room

The Greek Ministry of Educa-
tion has appropriated 1,200 dollars
for the polishing ofuthe marble for
the Greek Room, Mrs. Ruth Craw-
ford Mitchell, adviser on nation-
ality rooms, has announced.

Mrs. Mitchell was informed of
the appropriation by Ncholas Kal-
mer, charman of the Greek Me-
morial Room committee, who
had received a cable from Greek
Minister of Education Georgako-
poulos.

The marble will be selected
from one of the ﬁnest quarries in
Greece by architect John Travlos.
It will be cut and carved in the
Workshops of one of the most ex-

perienced cutters in Athens. The‘

uncut marble will be purchased
withfunds raised in America by
the Greek Room committee.

The Greek government‘ first be-
came interested in the Greek
Room through the efforts of Mrs.
Peter Caloyer, a member of the
committee, during her stay in
Athens in 1937, Final arrange-
ments were completed by J.-K.
Steliotes, treasurer of the com-
mittee, before his death last Jan-
uary. The University was not in-
formed of the appropriation until
recently.

Arrives For Debates

Groups Discuss
Pan Americanism

At Inquiry Forum

Debaters representing the
University of Puerto Rico will
meet two University debaters
for the ﬁrst time today at In-
quiry Forum, at. 12:30 o’clock
in 129 Cathedral, for a dis-
cussion of the Pan-American pol-
icy of the United States.

A In a symposium debate in which
each speaker will present his
viewpoint on one phase of the
subject, the two Puerto Ricans
will uphold the affirmative side of
the question, “Resolved, That an
American League of Nations
should be established.”

William Stark,- C38, and Abe
Wolovitz, C40, will defend the
negative. Two of the three mem-
bers of the Puerto Rican team,
R. a f a e l Martinez-Alvarez, Jr.,
Juan Rodriguez, and Luis Borrios,
will speak. The debate is open to
all students and faculty members.

CONSIDER POLICY ’

Another debate between the
two schools will be broadcast to-
morrow evening at 10:30 o’clock
over KDKA on Dr. Bernard C.
Clausen’s “Town Meeting.” Rep-
resenting the University in a
round-table disciission on the

Pan-American subject will be Hy-‘

man Richman,,C39, and Stark.
At today’s Inquiry Forum meet-
ing, present-day Pan-American
relations and President Roose-
velt’s “good neighbor” policy will
be considered by both sides. Wolo-
vitz will open the meeting with an
explanatory speech, giving the
history of Pan-American relations

.and citing the issues to be con-

sidered. .
ARRIVED LAST MONDAY

He will be followed by the
Puerto Ricans, who will expound
the theory that a League of Na-
tions should be adopted in the
western hemisphere. The case of
the negative will then be conclud-
ed with an address by Stark.

The three veteran members of
the University of Puerto Rico’s
debating team, all students in the
College of Law, arrived in New
York last Monday for a series of
debates with nine American uni-
versities and colleges. Following
their broadcast tomorrow, they
will leave Pittsburgh for a debate
at Middlebury college. ,

Issues of today’s debate, accord-
ing to Wolovitz, include, “Does the

Tea_Proves
Popular Drink

At University

It will be “tea time” again this
afternoon in the Commons Room
of the Cathedral when Mrs. J . K.
Miller, hostess of the Commons
Room, and her assistants serve at
the third informal social hour
from 3 to 5 o’clock.

According to the amount of tea
that has been’ consumed at the
ﬁrst two affairs, the weekly social
hours are being enthusiastically
attended by many students.

Assisting Mrs. Miller this after-
noon will be Mrs. Charles Prall,
Mrs. Charles Tippetts, and Mrs. J .
Lloyd Mahoney.

Mrs. Miller suggests that any or
all students drop down to the
Commons Room for “a spot of tea

and a little chat with friends.”

German Club Will Present Play
On Sigma. Kappa. Phi Program

Hisses for the villain and cheers¢

for the heroine will make Heinz
House a noisy place Friday eve-
ning when the‘ curtain rises at 7:30
o’clock on the German Club’s mel-
lerdrammer, “The Drunkard.”

The play will be one of the fea-
tures of the annual open house
night of "Sigma Kappa Phi, honor-
ary modern languages fraternitty.

Included in the cast of the play,
which will be presented entirely in
German, are Jack Weisbrod, C39,
as the villiain who, as the old
story goes, is just about to take
over the mortgage on the old
homestead of the heroine, Ger-
trude Broido, C39, when the two-
ﬁsted, two—gun hero, Herbert
Parnes, _C39, appears on the scene

in the nick of time. Everything,

of course, turns out rosy.

Others in the cast are Lorraine
Clatty, Ed38, as the heroine’s
mother; and Herbert Koch, C39, in
the dual role as the bartender and
as Rencelaw, the villain’s friend.

Since members of the cast .were
unable to learn their parts in time,
the play will be produced as com-
ing from a radio studio so the act-
ors may read their parts. Robert
King, C38, will be the radio an-
nouncer.

For the last two years the club
has presented another well-aged
mellerdrammer, “Murder in the
Old Red Barn,” but this year‘ they
have decided to be different. May-
be the sub-title of this year's play
could be “Murder in the Old Re

Bar,” or something. —

U . 5. Navy Preparedness Plan

V

By IRVING BENNETT

Free trade and tariff barriers,
“the eroded plains of China,” and
ancient history came up for dis-
cussion Friday afternoon at the
Student-Faculty Association Fo-
um, in the course of a debate on
the subject “Does the Big Navy
Mean Peace?”

ROTC men, Al Kairys, BA38,
and Jack Withum, BA38, opposed
“noncombatants” Claience Wible,
C38, and Raymond C. Maclntyre,
C38. The speakers veered from
the question to touch on the trade
angle, dictatorships, and state-
ments made by several Chinese
emporors.

‘PEACE GUARANTEE’

Kairys, the opening affirmative
speaker, argued that “the navy is
a preventative of war; its size is
our greatest guarantee of peace.”
He insisted that the navy be large
enough to cope with possible en-
emies, but decried claims that it
was being built for aggression.
Answering a , question, Kairys
agreed that our navy must be able
to go out to ﬁght the enemy, “not
ﬁght them in our waters.”

“Who wants the big lnavy?”
asked Wible, and answered that

Landscaping Of Frick

With Oncoming Spring
Further work on the Heinz
Chapel and the completion of
the landscaping on the Belle-
ﬁeld street side of Frick Acres
are the immediate construction
projects of the University, an-

nounces Albert Klimchek, Univer-
sity architect.

Sixty—foot stained glass windows
are being installed in the chapel,
and the sub—construction for the
chancel is being built. The ramp
from the chapel to Belleﬁeld street
leading in the direction of Forbes
street has been removed, and steps
will be placed threre instead.

Six large new trees will be
placed about the Chapel. I

(Four are being placed in front,
and the remaining two -will be
planted behind the chapel.

A retaining wall will be built
behind the chapel. This wall, Mr.
Klimchek stated, will follow the
contour of the chapel. After this
wall is built, theyremainder of the
lawn on Belleﬁeld street‘ will be
sodded.

Engineers Plan
Spring Smoker

The annual Spring Smoker
sponsored by the Engineering As-
sociation will be held Wednesday
evening, April 13, according to
William R. Smith, CE39, chairman
of the smoker.

Smith urges that the various en-
gineering departments begin prac-
tice as soon as possible on the
stunts which they will perform at
the smoker. As a custom of this
annual smoker, each department
will perform a stunt. The winning
department will receive a prize.

Engineering students interested
in entering the University intra-
mural swimming meet as mem-
bers of the Engineering School
team should also see Smith as soon
as possible.

The smoker will be held in the
Cathedral, and the room number
will be announced in a later issue
of The News, Smith said.

it was desired by the navy and
the munitions industry. Quoting
several navy men, Wible claimed
their statement showed that the
President’s policy was for aggres-
sion. The speaker said that state-
ments of our continent’s invasion
are “mere propoganda.”

“Any man in the ROTC,” agreed
Withum, “knows that fear of an
attack now on our shore is ludi-
crous.” But, he said, attacks on
ships such as that belonging to the
Standard Oil company, sunk with
the Panay, are slaps at the U. S.
“We must defend our face at all
costs.”

U. S. NOT EVIPERILED
V Maclntyre claimed that Amer-
ica has nothing to fear from
Fascist encroachments on the basis
of their military strength. Dis-
cussing lines of Fascist expansion,
he said they touched America

only in the Philippines, “but Japan ,
has enough on her handsinow in

FACULTY TESTS

Previously uninvited, probably
because of a poor response to the
Wassermann test invitation last
fall, faculty members may. take
the Tuberculin test this week.

“I believe that faculty members
should encourage this campaign
against the White Plague, said’ Dr.
H. C. Carlson; director of the
mens’ health service.

“The students have certainly co-
operated in our two campaigns
this year to eradicate social dis-
ease, and while the faculty did not
support the last one, they will
probably support the Tuberculin
test project because there will un-
doubtedly be several positive re-
actions among faculty members.”

X-RAY PHOTOS ' ,

“Tuberculosis,” he continued,
“is one of our most infectious dis-
eases and the faculty members
owe it to their students to make
certain that they have not become
infected.” ‘

In addition to administering
free Tuberculin ,tests,. The Pitt
News and the health services have
arranged to make X-ray photos of
students who react positively to
the test at the amazingly low ﬁg-
ure of twodollars. Ordinarily
X-ray photos run from $10 to $15.

Tuberculin Tests--Those
Who ‘Don’t‘ Need Them’

'A.§:§’l“ week a son of one of the University
factulty iiieiiibers was in the Falk Clinic
to receive treatiiieiit for a sore throat or some
_otlier minor ailment. Approaclied by a stu-
dent who had just taken the tuberculin test,
he _vv‘asasked if he expected to take the test.

What America Needs
Is More ‘Career Diplomats’

ERHAPS if America had more career men

in its diplomatic service, it could more

easily avoid those “entangliiig alliances” we,
fear so much.

The cardinal principle" in diplomacy is to
keep your mouth shut, and if you must make
a speech, gush over such platitudes as Amer-
ica’s friendship for all peoples, the importance
of int‘eriiationa.l peace and similiar ideas.

Unfortunately, Joseph P. Kennedy, our new
ambassador to England, is not a professional

a diplomat and is taking his position too literally.

He asserted. in London the other evening,

that reports that the United States will not

ﬁght unless it is invaded are a “dangerous

’ sort of misunderstanding.”

“That kind ‘of, diplomacy is dangerous no

. matter how you look at it. . It may or may not
be a true expression of Americon opinion; in

any event, it gives the British the wrong idea.

‘Mr. Kennedyniay be" forced into justifying"

his claiiii through pressure of Britisli propa-
ganda, which is always working for a friend.
Tlieii we may see a repeat performan'ce_of
VValter Hines‘:Page,‘America’s envoy totlie,
Court of St. James before the last war. He
becameiso .pro—B__ritish that his reports home
continually insisted upon the desirablility of
American aid to England, when there was con-

siderable doubt on that point.

Starred in this picture were Miriam Hopkins and Ray Mil-

pith helmet, a jungle, or a naval
uniform, at the very least.

And the Armour star label
would extend all the way down
the cast even to the smallest bit

put on the director because there

put in some good

they are not old

The author, by the way, must
have thought he achieved a nice
little contrast by balancing the
extreme youth of these two little
girls with the age of most of his
situations. In a way he was suc-
cessful because the best thing
about the show was that you, in
the audience, didn’t have to ex-
perience even the least little wor-
ry about anything.

JUST ANOTHER COMEDY
You could just sit back and wait

 

Nick Spanos

for everything to run off smoothly’

and quietly all because you knew
that here was a story that had,
been around that could take ‘care,
of i’rse.lf,_that knew an the traps’
and pitfalls of the theatre from
long hard years of experience.
What I’m being so long winded
about is that here is another so-
phisticated coinedy, and I’m get-
iing just about fed up on sophisti-
cated comedies especially when
they’re as unfunny-as thisone.
The story starts by showing you
lVi'ir.iani as a merry little rich girl
who has been living the life of
P.eilly’s Wife while Rei1ly’s Wife is
sjmc-where else. ' ‘

MIRIAIVI FALLS HARD

Now all of a sudden this woman
of sin," with her diamonds and her
painted lips, strips. She strips oﬁ
all the false tinsel of her up till
row wasted life and determines to
dedicate herself to the cause of
recovering the children of her
poor dead sister who are being
raised in a den of iniquity by an
artist over in Greenwich village.

The artist is Ray Milland and

as you knew before the picture
opened Miriam falls for him—but
hard. And he—-well he likes her
until he finds she has a million
or two (somebody ought. to tell
these "Hollywood people a thing or
two about life). Anyway Ray has
it against all rich people because
of a friend of his who sacrificed
all his artistic ideals and still isn't
making any money.
DORSEY DEFINITELY OK

So boy hates girl; but» only on-
surface; underneath he burns with

desire for her. Its the same with
the girl only she shows it. Finally
the picture works itself up to the
inevitable jail scene. Surely you
know the jail scene by now. (If
you don’t drop up to the News
office and I’ll introduce you..After
the jail scene the picture works
itself up to a slow finish and a
fadeout of Ray wfapped around

Miss Rearick Chooses

To Study Hungarian Life

By Alice

Benovitz

“Budapest egy csoda szep varos, es szeretnek meg cgyszer
ott lenni.” In the best Hungarian of Miss Elizabeth R-earick,
head of the women’s physical education department, that means

“Budapest is a beautiful city, and I should like to

some day.”

return ‘there

In casting about for a subject for her »:loctor’s thesis, Miss

Rearick decided to study the 0115-9

toms and dances of a European
people. When asked why she hap-
pened to chose Hungary she said,
“Hungary is one of the few Euro-
pean countries in which the peo-
ple have clung to their old cus-
toms.”

USED SIGN LANGUAGE

In 1932 she set sail for Hun-
gary, her entire Hungarian vocab-
ulary consisting of only a few
words and phrases. She register-
ed at the Hungarian Royal College
of Physical Education—the only
school of its kind in the country.

For the large sum of 80 pengos
($10) she received a semester’s
tuition, board, room, laundry, and
four roommates. Miss Rearick
said, “The girls were lovely to me.

We were all very friendly, even
though our conversation consisted
of mangled Hungarian, a dash of
German, and for the greater part
--the sign language.”

STUDIED PEASANTS

Like everyone else who has vis-
ited Budapest, Miss Rearick could
not say enough about it. She re-
members the wide promenades
on both sides of the slow-moving
Danube that separate the old sec-
tion, Buda, with its palaces, from
the newer business’ section of Pest.
Every evening, the people leisure-
ly stroll along the river, stopping
to have a drink at one of the in-
numerable c‘afe-houses. -

. Miss". Rearick said- that .at.. _.the

time of her visit, there was yet no
talk of fascism. But she felt that
the university students in Hun-

gary were more interested in po-
litical affairs than American
youth. However, Miss Rearick

thinks that the students here have
now surpassed the Hungarians in
that respect.

Since she was there chieﬂy to
study the peasants, Miss Rearick
made many trips into the country.
Often in her attempt to reach an
isolated village, she had to walk
miles from the station. She said,
“My heaviest equipment was the
motion picture camera that I al-
ways had with me.”

TOOK COPIOUS NOTES

In a little mining village Miss
Rearick visited, she was amused
to see that although the women
still retained their magniﬁcently
embroidered. costumes, the men
wore modern suits. It seemed the
men couldn’t part with their high
boots, so they wore their trousers
inside the (boots.

Like the majority of people the
world over, the Hungarian peas-
ants do not care who is in power
or what alliances are made, as
long as their taxes don’t get too
high and they can keep their lit-
tleplots of land. .

For eight months, Miss Rearick
took pictures and made hundreds
of notes and observations. She ex-
pects to have the ﬁnal resultvof all

her work, the thesis on the cus-
. toms and dances of the Hungar-
ians, published in a few weeks.‘ .4

Plans To News Writer

Soprano Makes Her Home In Connecticut;
Is Probably Most Gracious Concert Star
By Austin Hay

The world’s most exquisite coloratura soprano, Lily Pons,
who gave the closing May Beegle concert at the Mosque last
week, has deﬁnitely shown that she is not dependent upon
scenic glamor of the opera and motion pictures for her success.

Her remarkable qualitieswere evidenced in a program
featuring operatic arias. ’ Frank La. Forge, the celebrated teach-

er-coniposer-pianist, provided admirable accoinpaniments.

In

one of his compositions a ﬂute ob-v*

ligato with the voice was very ef-

fective.

Her amazing ease in executing
breathless trills, staccati, and airy
cadenzas held a capacity audience
in enchantment. "The tremendous
ovations that have greeted this
singing star of fourfold fame tes-
tify to the
‘place-fisher oc-
cupies in the
heart of the
world.

In conversa-
sation at her
h 0 t el suite,
Miss Pons told
of her future
plans.

“After a six
weeks tour ap-
p e a r i n g in
such places as,
St 0 c k h 0 lm,

 

Lily Pons

Brazil and Uraguay zen I rest a
months at my ’ouse in Norwalk,

Connecticut.” The fact that she
has built in America is evidence
of what America means to her. A
quick smile, born in her brown
sparkling eyes, ﬂashed over her
face and we ‘interpreted the genu-
-inc‘ plea-sure Lily felt toward her
home.
‘I AM PETITE’

“I like to be wiz my pet dogs,
cats, and cockatoo. Zee garden. ees
my joy, too-—-I be in time to take
caregof zee crocus now in bloom.’’.

Li1y’s soft red hair, which «she

washes every morning, isworn in.

Page Boy style. Her short skirt
and coat set oﬁ her small and
graceful ﬁgure to perfection (Wt.
104). Tuckedunder. the piano

bench were her No. 2 shoes. Lily. A

describes herself-—“I am not tiny,

_ no,,no I am petite!”—as she rip-

ples up and down the G scale.
The whole world has followed
the career of Lily Pons. Born in
Cannes, France, her mother was
Italian and her father French,
and at the age of ﬁve she was
playing compositions of Chopin.
American audiences ﬁrst heard
her at the Metropolitan Opera in
1931 when she sang Lucia di Lam-
mermoor. Her entry in motion
pictures was hailed as a sensa-

‘ tional event and in “I Dream Too

Much” she endeaied herself" to
the public. -

Lily Pons is one of the few.

prima donnas who go out of their
way to meet the public. While on
concert tour she always carries
tickets to the performance in her
purse. Should an elevator boy or

anyone she meets express a wish I

to hear her concert she graciously
presents him with a ticket. Sev-

eral stories were told in which she
rewarded taxi drivers for getting
her to a concert on time.

LIKES MODERN ‘Music I

“Eet ees so wonderful to have.

so many friends, I am lucky to
have zem in evairy. city in zee
world—and they are part of me.
Life would be sad .,i,n,deed_ wizout
z_em.” -

Her fans swarm around her like
a locust scourge——no sneaking out
of stage doors or hiding in dress-
ing rooms as is the case of so
many celebrated stars. Lily is too
happy to meet her adoring public.

Her love for music ‘does not
necessarily mean only the classics:

- “I like modern music and even
swing music-—if eet ees good. Je-
rome Kern and Cole Porter write
lovely songs, but of course my
best favorite was the beloved
George Gershwin. I enjoy hear-
ing Benny Goodman very _much.”

Speaking of orchestras her ro-
mance with Andre Kostelanetz is
still on the up and up. When ques-
tioned further, her answer: “this,
ees a secret, eet ees vairee pri-
vate.”

APPROVES CATHEDRAL LAWN

Lily took great pleasure in ex-
hibiting her 22 karat diamond
which she is wearing on the third
ﬁnger of her left hand. - She also
is very proud of a, diamond stud-
ded bracelet which was given her
by movie star Jack Oakie. Around
this bracelet are thirteen charms
since 13 is her lucky number. .

While strolling along the Cathe-
dral walks on the Pitt campus
during the afternoon, Lily‘ enthu-
siastically remarked:  . » .

“Zee building ees vairee beauti-
ful and tall——and oh, zee lawn, eet
ees so green and lovelee.”

That week is still a long way

now. On Monday, April 4, Car-

ELUCIDATION: Those who
looked at the last Pitt-Duke hock-
ey score and gasped a little are
due an explanation. The point-
pouring Panther attack was due
to any number of reasons. First
of all, was the fact that the Dukes
had won the first game and Pitt
just had to win. Being a team
that wins when it has to win, the
Panthers did that. Also, a note
of appreciation should be sent to
Mr. Claire Burckey, who placed
Bob Schooley on the second team
of his all-city selection.

%==i=>?-

Schooley, who had been the out-
standing Panther on the ice dur-
ing most of the season, reached his
heights in the ﬁnal play-off game
against the Dukes. He was bound
to have one night when every-
thing went right for him and it
turned out to be that very import-
ant Tuesday.

always played a good ball game.

Johnny Urban and Dick Cassi-

respectively. It
was the out-

of these two
V that made pos-

In the two
remaining posi-
tions, Bill Ed-

George Davies

of PiKA, both members of Dr.
Zehfuss’ freshman team of last

League B’s line up looks like an
All-America football team. John-
ny Micheloson and Don Hensley of
the Kappa Sigs, John Chickerneo
and Bill Daddio of Theta Chi, and
Heinie Adams of Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon comprise the ﬁrst team.

Micheloson is a repeater from
last year at one of the forward
berts. His ac-

curate shooting
and all round
playing was re-
sponsible for
the majority of
the Kappa Sigs
victories.

At the other

forward is Bill
Daddio. Bill
played his best
game of the

 

season in the

Cassiono Theta Chl win
over K a p p a

Sigma. He is a good passer and a

fast dribbler.
ADAMS A FEEDER

Heinie Adams at center is of the
same type of ball player as Myles
Zeleznick. He consistently gave
away chances at the basket to
feed his teammates.

At the‘two guard position are
John Chickerneo and Don “Duck”
Hensley. Chick is another hold-
over from last year.
and defensive tactics stamped him
as the outstanding star of League
B. Hensley was a three star man
with his passing, shooting and de-
fensive work.

Wandering Sports Reporter Takes
2 Another Campus Poll

By BILL NIAZEFSKY
‘Every once in a while the slightly eccentric sports editor
hands out a slightly eccentric assignment to one of the slightly

eccentric sports reporters.

Sometimes the results are used for

space filler and sometimes the results are used for waste-basket

ﬁller.‘

This assignment deals with spring and how it effects the
student body. Not the routine effects that force the class-cutting

ratio up to dizzy heights, or thefé

odd—colored style patterns that
suddenly blossom forth in the Com-
Room and on the campus.
Nor does he
want any stuﬁ
about love
smitten couples
that are begin-
ning to dot the
shady nooks—
that’s to be left
to the gossip
columnists.

He wants a
nice, virile story
about baseball
or something to
that effect. He
has been read-
ing the baseball reports that have
been drifting out of the South and
West where the major league ball
clubs are swatting around the ball
and kicking the kinks out of beer-
ridden muscles. And where the
publicity agents are busy knock-
ing out stories about new Ty
Cobbs, and Babe Ruths, and Chris-
ty Mathewsons, and all that sort of
malarky.

YIIOEIS

 

Traynor

“WE’LL WIN”

Every time he picks up the pa-
per he reads about what some
baseball manager has to say about
who will win the pennant and
why. Bill Terry, Giant manager,
thinks. the Giants will win; Pie
Traynor, Pirate Manager, thinks
the Pirates will win; Charley
Grimm. manager of Chicago Cubs
thinks the Chicago Cubs will win;
Jimmie Wilson, manager of the
Phillies, thinks the Phillies will

win; Frank Frisch, manager of-the

St. Louis Cards thinks the Cards
will win.

The sports editor is beginning to
suspect some sort of bias exists
here, and besides he wants to
scoop the downtown papers and
ﬁnd out what the man on the
street (or the campus) thinks.

FOUR QUESTIONED

Four baseball fans and a girl
were questioned. The four fans
were in a corner of the Commons
Room trying to kill time with a
little penny tossing. Each of the
fans had seen about half of a lot
of games last season and were dis-
gusted with the entire Pirate situ-
ation and they meant situation,
literally. They had classes up on
the twenty-ﬁrst floor and naturally
ignored the Prof to keep an eye
peeled on Forbes Field.

But the architect or someone
had situated the baseball ﬁeld
very oddly and all they could see
was second and third base and the
outﬁel.ders. So the whole thing
was complicated and sometimes
they went home celebrating a Pi-
rate victory to discover that the
Giants had won 14-0.

ONE GIANT

But they thought that the Pi-
rates were a cinch to win the pen-
nant; and besides the interviewer
was interfering with their little
game.

The girl picked the Giants to
win because Hubbell was good for
twenty-ﬁve victories; Ott would
still mainstay the outﬁeld; Terry
had managed to bolster the inﬁeld;
and a lot more technical stuﬁ that
this reporter didn’t understand.
The girl lives in New York, so her
testimony can be discounted.

On First Team

By JIM DAILEY
Sticking our necks’ out the

hockey reporters hereby pre-
sent their all-conference hock-
ey team for you and you and
you to pick at, ‘ ' ' V
Here it comes: First tea.m+

V fense, Broido of

Duquesne leads in the selections
with four choices, while Pitt and
John Carroll, the teams who will

placed three each.

sion of the league while the west- .

ern division could only get four.
Baldwin Wallace and Fenn of the

latter division are comparative.

weak sisters, each winning only
one game apiece, and neither hav-
ing an outstanding star.

‘ The stand out man of the group
in. our opinion is Arsenault of
John Carroll. A Easily the best

oﬁensive hockey
p l a y er in the
league, he can

guarantee his
coach at least one
goal a game, and
frequently two or
three. His big as-
set is a lightning
shot which is dif-
ficult to see even
by the spectator,
much less the goalie.

Vance of Duquesne comes pret-
ty close to Arsenault in scoring
ability. His specialty is clever
maneuvering along with expert
stick-work, enabling him to get
closer to the nets than Arsenault
on most of his slnots.

FRIDAY SHIFTED

Dick Friday, normally a center,
couldn’t be kept off the ﬁrst line.
His passing and teamwork has
made the “mighty little man” of
l27Hpounds a standout all year.
All three of the goals scored in the
last play—off game were ‘the result
of his passing. 1' ‘‘

Bob Schooley is the “jack-of-
all-trades” of the aggregation"
playing both defense and wing
during the season. He is as much
at home in one as in the other so
he went to defense to make way
for Friday.

There are about four good
goalies in the league, but the
standout, on the word of Coach
lVlcSorley and most of the players
is Berkeley of Western Reserve.
Berkeley, with practically no de-
fense in front of him, h.as the best
record in the league when an av-
erage of goals made from the
number of shots taken is compiled.

ONE DEFENSE

Rog Schaeffer of Duquesne is
the only bona—ﬁde defense man to
make the ﬁrst team. Schaeifer is
the best skater and scoring threat
of all the defense men in the
league. His jaunts up the ice for
scores are almost as frequent as
a wings.

At least three of the boys on the
second team barely missed the
ﬁrst combination. Broido would
have made it had it not been for
Schooley’s shift, and there isn’t
and doubt that Jack Culver would
have commanded much more at-
tention had he some one to work
with.

the women’s health service. X-ray
ﬁlms are made at Falk Clinic by
expert stereopticians, and are read
by Dr. Harold Brown, instructor
in the School of Medicine and
stereoptician at the Tuberculosis

League hospital.

Commenting upon the ﬁnal
week tests, Dr. Jamison, director
of the women’s health service,
said yesterday: “It is our hope that
all students in the University will
take a Tuberculin test. Those
who have not already done so
should come to the men’s or wo-
men’s health service sometime be-
fore Wednesday of this week.

“This beneﬁcial test, involving
no effort on the students’ part be-
yond appearing at the services,
will certainly aid in detecting this
dread disease. For the students’
own good we advise that he or she
take a Tuberculin.”

The health services will be open
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday

only. Hours are from 9 to 4:30

o’clock.

Dr. Alexander

Advises ‘Work sq
On Hospital

Immediate construction on
the University campus of a new
municipal hospital with 250
beds was recommended by Dr.
I. Hope Alexander, city health

director, in a recent report to
City Council.

Statingthat the city was in
dire need of a new hospital for
contagious diseases, Dr. Alexander
suggested the University campus
as the location. He said Chancel-
lor John G. Bowman had offered
to give the land to the city.

Dr. Alexander quoted Dr. Bow-
man as saying: “If the hospital
should be located near the Uni-
versity it would be a great aid to
clinical instruction in medicine and
dentistry.”

The proposed municipal hospital
will be another step toward the
completion of the rapidly expand-
ing University Medical Center. At
present there are two additions to
the medical group in the process of
construction.

nental league of nations 'have a
greater chance for success than a
world league?”

Answering these questions,
Stark says, “An American League
of Nations of necessity means
American domination. Domina-
tion means the use of force. And
the use of force is inimical to the
success of such a league, which
must depend upon cooperation.”
Richman, who will speak on to-
morrow evening’s broadcast with
Stark, believes that the cultural,
geographic, economic, and politic-
al conditions in Latin America are
the same as those which lead to
the downfall of the world league.

French Unit

Presents Travelogue

Speaking of successful affairs,
we can’t fail to mention the en-
tertainment put on by the fresh-
man’s French Unit last Friday
afternoon in Heinz House. Hav-
ing invited the Acting, Public
Speaking, and Writing Units to
take a trip through France, the
little Parisians proceeded to pass
out passports to the travelers at
the French Customs Oflice in the
most novel manner.

En route t 11 r o u g h sunny
France, the Voyageurs witnessed
a puppet show of The Three
Bears (all in French), and
learned how folk, acrobatic, and
tap ‘dancing is done en francais.
Lucille Uptegraff, chairman of
Freshman Council, enjoyed her
journey as honor guest.

SAM ’s Mothers’ Club

‘Play Bridge

It sounded like a rather rough
affair at the Sammies’ house last
night when we heard that a lot of
shufﬁing, slamming, and close
dealing had occurred. Following
up our ﬁrst alarm, we discovered
nothing more harmful than a very
extra-nice card party had been
held by the Mothers’ Club, which
is presided over by president Mrs.
Sol Black.

Credit for the arrangement of
the bridge games, prizes, and the
delicious meal which came last all
goes to co-chairmen Mrs. Wintner
and Mrs. Hoffman.

No ‘Puﬂerbillies’
By Beta Sigma Omicron

Sincerest apologies go to-Beta
Sigma Omicron, the fraternity
who won the recent Panhellenic
Song contest, for an error made
at the Panhel mass meeting last
Monday.

Their winning song was writ-
ten to the tune of “Puﬂcrbillies”
instead of to “Santa Lucia” as
was sung by the Woman’s Choral
and printed -in The -News.

Thetas Dance

More pledge officer news has-
reached us by way of a reporter‘

from Kappa Alpha Theta. In hon-
or of president Mary Ruth Good-
win, secretary Margaret Gibson,

treasurer Ruth Sheppard, and all.

the other Thetas—to—be, theactives.
invited their friends to an Open:
House dance last Saturday a week.

ZTA’s Honor
Founding Of Chapter

Those little blue and white
ribbons the ZTA’s were sporting
last Friday mean that a new
chapter has been installed down
south. This seventy-third addi-
tion to the Zeta chapter roll,
called Gamma Alpha, has just
been founded at the University
of Miami, located in Miami,
Florida.

 

 

iPhi Eta Sigma

Honors T appees

Twenty-two freshmen were in--
itiated into Phi Eta Sigma, na-
tional honorary freshman scho-
lastic fraternity, at a banquet last
Thursday in the Cathedral Man-

sions. Charles Custer, C40, is
president of the group. .

The initiates comprise the
group announced at the recent

Scholars Day tapping ceremonies.
They are to hold a meeting April
5, with the actives from last year
attending.

Robert Dannies, C39, was made
a member of the group, in recog-
nition of his work in forming the
first University 'chapter.

    

 
 

. . the reason they give so many smokers
more pleasure . . .is the full ﬂavor and aroma
of mild ripe home-grown and aromatic Turk-
ish tobaccos. blended like no other cigarette.

 
   
  

 

T he Champagne cigarette paper used
in making Chesterﬁelds is pure . . . it
burns without taste or odor. . . z't’s the
best cigarette paper money can buy.
