New Blood Donor
Program Planned T
With University

Stuart J. Horner, Jr., director
of Donor Procurement of the
Central Blood Bank of Pittsburgh,
has announced that the Blood
Bank hopes to offer all persons
associated with the University a
new program whereby blood may
be donated in advance of need.

“ln‘this way,” he said. “the
University and the Blood Bank
will join in a cooperative self-
protection plan.”

Horner thanked the. student
body for their recent cooperation
in filling an inventory gap of 15
to 20 pints per day. Students be-
tween the ages of 18 and 21 who
still wish to donate blood must
have the written permission of a
parent, guardian, or wife.

After the blood has been given,
it can be donated either to donor
clubs such as the hemophelia,
lukemia or even a family donor
club: or the student can receive
payment of ten dollars for his
services. '

To eliminate unnecessary wait-
ing, students are advised to make
appointments. They can be made
either in person in the basement
of Fall: Clinic or by calling MU
2-1715.

Two Suspelldetl
For Stealing From
The Book Center

The suspension of two Univer-
sity students ended their short
reign of crime today after they
confessed to stea1ing'$l50 worth
of books and merchandise from

-the University book store last

term.

The two boys left school on the
condition that. they might be per-
mitted to return if and when they
reapply ‘for admission and are
found to have had satisfactory em-
ployment and personal records,
according to William B. Crafts,
dean of men. For that reason the
length of their suspension is not
ﬁxed.

“No legal action has been taken,
and none is contemplated,” Dr.
Crafts said. “We felt it was ex-
tremely unfortunate that. we had
to take any action at all. It was
necessary, however, in order to
maintain proper standards of con-
duct and respect for the property
of others.”

Editorial . . .

A literary Brigade

During a student’s career at a university he is con-
tinually exposed to the great works of geniuses whether in
the ﬁeld of literature, art or science. ‘Seldom, however,
does onehave access to a literary masterpiece like the one
that appeared in the Pittsburgh Press last Sunday.

What appeared to be a news story on one man’s opin-
ion about the Cuba crisis turned out to be a news story that
inferred quite strongly that the University was housing
a communist.

William Gill, Press reporter, is to be commended for
his highly skillful technique of slanting news — never has
anyone so subtly distorted-the facts. .

This vicious action has not only hurt the reputation of
one of the University’s ﬁnest history professors, Dr. Robert
G. Colodny, but it has also violated one of the basic prin-
ciples of the press —- to .present the truth to the public.

Throughout the entire article each statement made by I

Dr. Colodny is followed by some historical fact which
ostensibly was used to give the reader the true picture
which Mr. Gill believed existed.

One example that clearly shows Mr. Gill’s poor logical
analysis is one that concerned the Abraham- Lincoln Bri-
gade. This brigade was set up along language lines, not
along lines of political ideology. It was composed entirely
of Americans who fought with the Republican forces in
the Spanish Civil. War.

If Dr. Colodny sympathized with the Republican forces
at that time, he was not the only one. Earnest Hemingway,
by no means a communist, was one of its greatest sup-
porters. In fact he wrote two novels —- “For Whom the
Bells T011” and “The Fifth Column” —- which clearly reﬁect
these feelings. There were many other great Americans
who also supported this group.

But of course Mr. Gill preferred to let the public think
that Dr. Colodny was the sole American of any stature that
championed for this cause.

In the news story, after stating that Dr. Colodny fought
with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, the following appeared
in italics: The Communist-led Abraham Lincoln Brigade
still tops the Attorney Gen.eral’s list of subversive organi-
zations seeking to overthrow the United States Government
by force and violence.

Mr. Gill failed to state that Dr. Colodny stopped rela-

— tions with the organizations in 1938; Mr. Gill failed to state

that the character of the Brigade has changed from a ﬁght-

ing unit to a communist front group since that time; Mr;

Gill also failed to state that it was not classiﬁed by the
United States Government as a subversive group until the
1950’s — long after Dr. Colodny had left it. «

This example of what he left out can also be used to
show what he shrewdly included. The reason the Brigade
tops the Attorney General’s list is because the list is in
alphabetical order. and not because of its recently acquired
Communistic policies. I

Another thing Mr. Gill failed to include was that Dr.
Colodny was a staff sergeant with the S-2, an arm of the
Army’s G—2 intelligence unit during World War II. His
job demanded that he monitor Axis radio broadcasts and
advise on intelligence.matters concerning the Aleutians.
Before receiving this position he was given a strict security
clearance by the U. S. Government. And this was after he
had already fought with what Mr. Gill calls Communist
forces in Spain.

Later, he wrote “Battle of the Aleutians,” the oflicial
U. S. history of that operation, for which he was awarded
an Army commendation and medal.

Why the Pittsburgh Press, just as guilty as Mr. Gill,
would let such a derogatory article beprinted in their
paper is incomprehensible. A suggestion that might prove
worthwhile for members of the Press is to check the facts,
try to balance the news story, and to stop and think before
they brand an admirable person as something that leaves
the reader with the impression that our_ University is
harboring communists. ‘

inalt Sorority Rush    
Set for this W/eekendl

The Pan Hellenic Council will hold its ﬁnal sorority
rushing parties tomorrow through Saturday.
There will be two parties Thursday evening from 6:45

to 8:15‘ p.m. and from 3:15 to

10:00 p.m., so that more girls

can attend. Parties on Friday and Saturday will be from

7:30 to 9:30 p.m.

Each sorority will have its own?

theme for these parties. Decora-
tives and entertainment will meet
this theme, and refreshments will
be served.

Rushees may vote for the soror-
ity of their first and second choice
at the Dean of Women's otﬁce on

‘the 12th floor Cl. before 1:00 p.m.

on Monday.’ They will receive
their bids at 7:00 p.m. that eve-
ning. —

“A professional clerical worker
will match one of the girl‘s choices
with the sor-ority that has selected
her, so that none of us on the Pan
Hellenic Council will know which
was her first or second choice,”
commented B a r b a r a Goebler,
president of Pan Hel.

On Jan. 13 a Rushing Education
Program, sponsored by the Pan
Hellenic Association, gave the
girls an opportunity to learn more
about the rules for. rushing.

During a discussion period, they
learned how to accept sorority in-
vitations, whatgto wear to sorority
parties, and other matters con-
cerning rushing.

Band Director Workson Precision

Band Man O Gives
  Music, Movement

Great Importance

By JIM NELSON

“Let there be music!” com-
manded Robert “Ace” Arthur,
director of the Varsity
Marching and Concert Bands,
when he came to the Uni-
versity in 1941.

And there has been music. Music
of ﬂexible variation from rousing
Sousa marches and arrangements
of current broadway shows, of

football games to concert arrange-‘

ments of the mastehs-—all execut-
ed with the expertness of preci-
sion.
“The most important trait of a
good marching band is precision
of music and foot movements,”
Arthur said. ‘Before the band
starts practicing the music and
working out the detailed ﬁeld
‘ charts.
Step to the Music
The music is written to coincide
with the ﬁeld charts. The band
marches at a speed of 140-160
steps per nrrlnute. This is about
eight steps to every five yards
using a 22 inch step.

“Although there are standard
arrangements on the market, we
write all of our own arrange-
ments.” Arthur continued, “This
gives the band a more unique

‘" touch.”
-— “One thing I would like to make
clear,” said Arthur, “is that there
1 is more than the marching band
at Pitt. We also have a concert
band that plays good band music,
and, contrary torpopular belief,
"not all ‘long hair stuff.‘ ”
Applause Appeases
Arthur said that his most mem-
orable experience happens every
time that he hears an ovation of
applause from people who have

. listened and enjoyed the band’s
:music. “This is_ especially true

when we play at Ohio State at
Columbus,” he said.

“The main thing that keeps
the band at such a high status
is that all the members like to
do things well, and they all
have ﬁne spirit," Arthur con-
cluded. ” ‘

The concert band is currently

»preparing for a concert in Car-

negie Hall on April 7.

Two Students Suspended
  On Charges of» Stealing ,

(Cont1'.n.~u.ed from Page 1)

“The suspension, we hope, will
provide a breathing spell during
which the boys can re-evaluate
their conduct and their goals and
determine their future course of
action, including the feasibility of
return to the University. We plan
to work with both the students
and their parents toward this con-
structive end.”

The Dean of Men's Office is
hopeful that the fate of thesé
students will serve to curb the-
activities of these students who
have been attempting to make
telephone calls free of charge.

During the last week of the Fall
trimester, approximately 60 stu-
dents admitted to tampering with
public telephones in the dormi-
tories and Student Union. Al-
though the telephones are no
longer being damaged, students
have discovered new ways to de-
fraud the telephone company.

Past methods have included the
use of coat hangers and giving
others’ credit numbers. The new
technique involves a spinning pen-
ny.

Furniture Taken
In addition, many coats, two

stuffed chairs and an expensive

lamp have been removed from the
Student Union lounge in the past
year. Also during the Swedish
Graphic Art Exhibit a $100 scene
was stolen.

Commenting on this, William
H. Cooper, director of the stu-
dent union, said, “We believe
that students have too high a
respect for art exhibits-this
was probably the work of some-
one who walked in from Forbes
Street.”

“In the stealing of coats, how-
ever, students are probably1j&
volved. In general we are well
pleased with the way students
have taken care of the furniture.
It is unfortunate that one percent
must _ make it/ unpleasant for
everyone.”

“I DIDN’T WANT TO BE STOCKPILED”

‘ When Loren Gergens was working for his
B.S. degree in,Business Administration at the
-University of Denver, he had deﬁnite ideas about
the kind of job he wanted to land. He was de-
termined to proﬁt from the experience of several
of -his friends who had accepted promising jobs
only to ﬁnd themselves.in “manpower pools”-
waiting to be pulled into a responsible position.

iMightier Than the Sword

  Ethical Re}sponsibi|ity ,

By Trudy Weiss

The art of journalism has pro-
gressed through some pretty
rough stages in its 270 years of
 Possibly the roughest and
the most well known of these
stages were. the years during
which ‘yellow journalism’ lwas
commonly practiced. In these

years scandalous affairs were
', splashed over I. .I_1eWspapers, and .
affairs other than scandalous be- _

came just that after their stories
were ‘published.

People were ruined overnight
as their names were linked pub-
licly with situations which, al-
though not unfactual, were pre-
sented in such a light as to make

the participants appear guilty of

 a crime.

This practice did- serve to

“build up the popularity of the

newspapers, even though it did
so by appealing to the emotions

of readers rather than their cool, *

rational reaction.
After newspapers achieved the

power and greatness which they

still wield today, s om e fair-

.minded reporters. and editors

agreed to a set policies on which
the business of reporting would
be based.

‘The substance of reporting
turned then from bright. flashy
and biased descriptions to ob-

‘ jective accounts of what we call

news. ,‘Bias’ and ‘slanting’ were
replaced by ‘objectivity’ and
‘balancing’ in news stories.

eldeas Reduced

These terms have no great,
deep and mysterious meaning.

In fact, the first two can be

reduced to the idea of unfair-
ness and the last two to fair-
ness. Or, unethical and ethical.
In other words a story , which
appears in today’s newspapers is
written in a clear concise man-

her ‘which allows the reader to

draw his own conclusiions from
the pure facts presented ‘by the
reporter. It is not among. the
rules of the game, however; to
present the facts in a distorted

way or out of context.

For example, if a man ex-

presses his opinion that he con-...
-spiders Fidel -Castro’s revolution.

in Cuba just another case of
 reform, .the. _ newspaper

print a statement of this opinion.

But it is, on the other hand,
out of the realm of rights of the
press to link such an opinion
with a statement that the’. Chi-
nese Communist leaders were
also portrayed to the American
public as ‘agrarian reformers be-

fore China and its 600 million, ..
: people fell to the Reds i._n,_1949.

Conclusions Distorted

Such a statement following
the opinion of a private citi-
zen of the United States might
lead readers to misunderstand
the press, and to form an en-
tirely distorted conclusion on
the given matter.

Two such facts,
enough intheir own context, are

highly explosive in combination._

Two such statements, when

presented in the proper context,

are objective in themselves. But
the good trait of objectivity in
newspaper reporting also shields
the bad trait of false objectivity.

Aereporter who knows all the
facts surrounding a case, but
chooses toinclude in his story
only those which serve to cast
the story in a rosy shade, is
practicing false objectivity. The
same is true of the reporter who
asks only those questions the
answers of which lead to an in-
tended conclusion.

Statements Altered

False objectivity is V also at-
tained by rearranging true state-
ments, or by inserting equally
true but irrelevant facts.

As Voltaire once said, “I may
not agree with what you have to
say, ‘I’ll defend to the death
your right to say it.” And pre-
sent day practices in journalism
which demand that ethics be re-
spected — including the practice
of ethical objectivity - also»de-
mand that newspapers, who do
have the “right to say it,’.’ do not
abuse that right. 

It is so important that correct
conclusion be drawn frorn a news
story, that news is presented in
such a way to‘ lead not to any
conclusion but to the one right
one. That is most likely the rea-
son why a few ~men saw the
necessity for a code of ethics in
reporting. And why most news-
papers insist on. following ethical

The Crux of Idealogy

By William Bennett

William Wordsworth is supposed to have once
observed that he would be disappoint d in a young
man if he were not a radical, equally disappointed
in an old one if he were not conservative. But
in the light of such actualities as
Senator Barry Goldwater’s well-
founded remark that American
youth is turning more and more

Wordsworth’s statement must be
revised. ,
The line between conserva-
tism and radicalism is a far
thinner -one than that between

 

tual poles separating youth and
“crabbed age.” Both of these

isms are extreme idealogies, and as such appeal
to a -younger generation in hopeful search of

idealist’ generalities; older. men, often driven to
their apathy by the failure of these same» hopes,
distrust and avoid enthusiastic movements.

More often ‘than not, ideologies have their
founders in young men. Lenin began his Bolshevik
career as a teenager; the ‘entire garish" apparatus
of Nazism formed itself it in Hitler’s mind before/
he was thirty.

Looking at some more positive idealogies, we
see Christ cruciﬁed at thirty-three, or Confucius
beginning his teachings as an adolescent.

And, as on occasion here at the University re-
cently demonstrated, the- editor. of the American
conservatives’ house organ “The National Review,”
is far from being the Spanish—American War vin-
tage curmudgeon that comes to mind when the
word “conservative” is dropped in imaginative
circles. William F. Buckley iisisof much the opposite
that his enemies have ample opportunity to refer
to him as “a twisted young .m_an.”

A Lost from Reality ‘ -

And ewhat of older men..who remain integral
parts of- idealogies and ismV’s?. These are the

__crusty fanatics, the Josef=j;;»Stglins and William

Jennings Bryans, men lost from reality, -often
more pathetic than formidable: "

‘ I have labored at length to makewhat should
be an obvious historical point} I am far more con-
cerned however, with the attitude generally taken
toward this -phenomenon. Is the failure to retain
idealistic hope the fault of the older generation?
Within.the context of the ideologies high expec-
tationsfas well as popular idealism, the answer
is yes.

i i.etters to

Graduate Student S

But within the harsh context of reality as men
have known it for centuries, the ideologies. them-
selves are the ones who must bear the blame for
their followers’ defection. '

Why should this be the case?
ideologies, even those so diametrically opposed as
to be constantly at one anothers’ throats, have cer-
tain basic characteristics, among which is the fatal
ﬂaw of -assuming a non-existent uniformity in
human behavior. ‘ '
Parasites Abound .

Materialistic socialism, for example, provides a
planned utopia, but only for a society in which‘
there are no parasites. Since, unfortunately, there:
are parasitic elements in the best of men, utopia’
is doomed from its inception. E1 on so positive an

Because all

’ ideal as Christianity neglects theibasic-reality that

not 7every_ human moral -code‘ can c'or_1form with
the Ten Commandments or the Beatitudes.’

The ﬁnal results of an ideologies being insti-
tuted and obeyed to "its initial high’-minded letter:

are tragically fatal. For the code, to be effective, ,

all of the individuals under_ its jurisdiction must_
conform to it; otherwise, thepseeds of failure are
immediately planted. Elimination of nonconform-
ists becomes a necessity. ' _

In the end, the ideologies is a grisly. cartoon of
its former self. God’s Kingdom on Earth becomes
Catholic Spain or the bestial Inquisition; Russia,
where government “will wither on the vine,” has
become a grim monument to universal hierarchy.

Suicide Thwarted '

There is a way, almost as sad in the ideal sense,
in which an ideologies, once set into operation, can
prevent itself from committing, suicide. It may
compromise, often with its deadly enemies. In a
‘capitalistic United States,'for example, such basic-
ally socialistic measures as insurance, social~.se-
curity or price controls-. are adapted to prevent a
system of free enterprises from becoming an obli-
garchy of the clever rich._ .

In “Fathers and Sons,’,’ Ivan Turgenev told a
story of the failure of an ideologies; ironically, it
was one in which he himself ‘ﬁrmly believed... In
an ‘essay written to justify this self-condemnation,
Turgenev remarked that in exposing the fatal
-.weaknesses of his liberal beliefs, he had doneso
only because ‘‘life was like that.” S

No man, however old or young, should ‘sacri-
ﬁce his idealism for apathy or cynicism; but nor
should allow himself to fall into the frustrating
error of forgetting that life is “like that.” i

Deplores Conditions

Editor, The Pitt News:

As a graduate student, recent-
ly returned to the campus, 1
have seen many outstanding

changes take place at this Uni- '

versity. These administrative tri-

umphs necd no repetition here

since they are familiar to all.
However, the University could

improve conditions in certain a‘s1””“‘

pects, especially in regard to the
graduate students. Most of the

graduate students are here be-
cause we want to be, not

be-
cause our parents expect it or
because it’s the thing to do.
Many of the graduate students
are married and live on deplet-
ing savings. Many of us receive‘.
no outside help except the aid

we may receive from devoted-,_
"wives who help us in any way

they can. One big help which
the University might extend
could be the _in form of Univer-
sity housing for married stu-
dents. .
Many other outstanding uni-
versities provide such assistance.
Here, the married student‘ is
thrown on the market and must
pay rental fees farout of pro-

portion to the value exchanged.”

The landlords know the Uni-

versity offers no protection‘ and

no competition in. this ﬁeld. Our

‘undergraduate’ brethren in turn

are protected by ‘the c oak of

«wasted time and» is less effec-

tive than using the classiﬁed sec-""

tion of the newspapers.

The other area of neglect is in
the medical ﬁeld..Man_v out of

faraway from known medical

rather poor source of medical

this official attitude is not in

If illness is not a respector of

Allan C. Shane Takes the Pictures

 Green Doors Shield

School Camera Man 

By TOM BRYANT

On the ninth ﬂoor of the Cathedral, behind a series of;
green doors, is located the oﬁice of a man, unknown to most '

University students.

Surrounded by expensive equipment andpvpossessing the

skill obtained only by years

of ‘practical experience, this

man provides most of the photographs of University func-

tions, other than those appearingé

Hisnameis Allan C. Shane, the
new University photographer, re-
placing Thomas Jarret, who re-
tired last June.

Behind the Scenes

It is Shane who acts as the
“Pitt man behind the camera,”
photographing various University
affairs and personalities for the
public relations office, newspapers,
personal portraits, and an endless
array of assignments.

Shane ,received the“ post of
University photographer la s t
June, after 23 years with the

Snow defunct Pittsburgh Sun-

Telegraph. After many years

“on the street,” he revealed that

he found it somewhat diﬂicultvto

adjust to the often long hours
in the darkroom.

A former architecture student
at Carnegie Tech, he dropped out
of school during the depression.
Inspired by his life-long interest
in photography, he later enrolled
in the Winona Lake School of
Photography, a professional inst.i-
tution using Eastman Kodak and
Ansco experts on the faculty.

Employed‘ at Sun-Tele

Later he was employed as a
staff ‘photographer on the Sun-
Telegraph. It was during his ten-
ure with the Tele that he experi-
enced a never-to-be-forgotten
“close-shave.” .

While covering a steel‘ strike
-in Youngstown, Ohio in 1937, a
fellow photographer was shot to
death before his eyes by the
rioting strikers.

Chancellor Poses

Shane says that Chancellor
Litchﬁeld is a very good photo-
graphic subpect. “He is not camera
conscious and nervous when con-
fronted. by a photographer, but
appears relaxed and pays no at-
ettention to the camera.”

From his small cubicles in the
cathedral, Shane is responsible_
_for graphically illustrating the
great advances of the univer-
sity.

Chances, are the next time you
see a picture of some phase of the
cathedral in a newspaper or ma-
gazine, Alan C. Shane, the man
io‘ehin.d the green door, was re-
sponsible for pushing the czmiera’
button.

Dr.‘ F oltin to Publish Boole
In March on Franz Werfel '

Dr. Lore Foltin, assistant professor in the German De-

partment, has just completed

a book on the life of Franz

VVerfel which will be published in March.

This is not Dr. Foltin’s ﬁrst attempt at writing, she has
written two texts which are entitled, “Deutsche Welt,”
which is currently being used at the University for elemen-

tary German students, and “Auge-

Nah und Fern.” _

When asked why she Chose to
write about Franz Werfel, Dr.
Foltin said that she was inter-
ested in his life, because he was
born in Prague, Czechoslovakia
where she received her education.

To get the ‘needed information
about his life, Dr. Foltin spent a
summer at the University of Cal-
ifornia and also did research in
Europe. Dr. Foltin also stated that
she met several of Werfel’s friends
and visited with his wife in New
York.

Franz Werfel is not unknown in
this country. He is an Austrian
poet, and has written dramas,
novels and essays. Two of his

works that were translated into
English are: “Forty Days to Musa
Bagh,” and “The. Song of Berna-
dette.”

  Panthers Host Southern Foe Tonight‘

WVU Features Thorn;
Cats Face Temple Next

By JIM O’BRIEN
The Panther roundball specialists will have to shake off
the effects of the Westminster frustration in a hurry if they
expect to retain their .500 pace this season. The Mounties of

_ West Virginia, boasting a‘ -10-3 record, visit the campus to-

night. favored to retain last year’s supremacy over the‘Cats.

 

 

  
 

The Mounties subdued their hosts twice last year, 76-66,

and 89-75. Their
leader, Jerry West. has appropri-
ately takena Horace Greeley‘s ad-
vice and joined up with the Los
Angeles pro team, but, as is tradi-
tion at Morgantown, he left a suc-
cessor.

Sophomore Rod Thorn, Coach
George King’s answer to West and
“Hot Rod" Hundley, can puncture
a steel rim with his deft, ﬂying
jump shots, and his presence
should sting.

Trouble From Shuck

Another newcomer who could
give Cat center, John Fridley, ﬁts
under the boards is, 6’ 8", Dave
Shuck, who also moved up from
the undefeated (.16-0 frosh.

West Virginia’s last win was
a whopping 20-point conquest
over Syracuse, 94-74. This is the
only common foe for the "wo
arch-rivals. Coach Bob Tim-
mons’ lads bested the Orange,
79-62. That imakes tonight’s
tussle a toss-up on paper, but

comparative game scores are
irrelevant.

The Cats’ hopes lie in John
‘E‘ridley’s defensive ability. He

must stop Thorn. Big John “shut-
out” the Orangemen’s top scoring
threat, Pete Chudy, while the lat-
ter managed 27. against the

s Mounties. Fridley has also been

averaging 20 rebounds a game for
the last ﬁve games, but will have
to be in top jumping form to
maintain that pace.

_ More Nightmares

The Morgantown invaders won't
be the only nightmares to keep
Timmons awake nights this week,
for on Saturday the Panthers
travel to Philadelphia to engage
Temple.

Temple bested the Panthers last
year, 82-74, but has the speed,
shooting and above—average depth
to repeat. Center Russ Gordon,
who is only 6 feet 41/2 but ave-
raged 13 rebounds a game last
year, is back along with starting
forwards Ed Devery and Earl
Proctor.

The squad needs height, how-
ever, and therein lies the hope of
the Cats. But Philadelphia is no

22-6 inBattle of Unbeaten

Lorry Lauchle
Loses Ist Dual
M eet Match

By 'rED5,CoLTo.\'

A bewitched, bothered and
badly beaten Panther wres-
tling team saw their dreams
of revenge go down the drain
Monday afternoon at the

Field House as fourth ranked
Michigan strong-armed the Cats.
22-6.

The 130 pound bout was a dark
preview of things to come. Larry
Lauchle, who had never lost a
dual meet match before, saw his
string of 21 straight victories go
by the boards. Fritz Kellerman,
lVlichigan’s defending Big Ten
Champ, upset Lauchle 6-4.

After Lauchle's defeat a somber
doom seemed to set in on the

- Field House and the crowd of

about 500 sensed the fate that
awaited the Panthers.
Zolikoﬂ’ Wins

In the 147-pound bout Cat hopes
were revived when John Z_oli-
koff got a takedown and a near-
fall in the first period to build up
an early lead. It looked like the
Panthers could get back into the
match if Zolikoff could get a pin.
But the match ended up with
the Panther 147 pounder in trouble
instead of Michigan’s Jim Baker.
The ﬁnal score was 7-4, with Zoli-
koff getting the victory.

Zolikoff’s win set the stage for
the meets big battle. With the
score tied at six all, a victory
for either team in the 157 pound
class could turn the tables for
the winner. 6

Three All-Americans Take Bow

Three Panther A11—Ameri-
cans took their bows before
a large throng of admirers at
the Field House Saturday in
the Steeler-Pirate charity
game: Charley Hyatt, Don
Hennon and Mike Ditka.

Oldtimer Hyat, All—American in
1928-29-30, proved in the early
moments of the game that he
hadn’t lost the touch. At first he
stressed defensive play, back-
stepping cautiously down, court
the moment his Pirates surrender-
ed possession.

Then he went gung-ho in an-
swer to the pleas of the fans and
released two straight setshots, all
initiating from the knecaps. The
second cleanly swished the hoop
and Charley raced off the floor,
smiling like a schoolboy bench-
warmer. 6

Look Like Gridder

‘Don Hennon was shooting for
the Steelers and scored 7 points.

ers had trouble distinguishing him

Hyatt claimed that the change
of atmosphere hurt his perform-
ance. “I was used to playing un-
derneath the Stadium,” he smiled.
“Doc” Carlson looks in better
shape than I do.”

Hammer Controls Boards

Concerning Ditka’s board prow-
ess, Pirate captain, Dick Groat,
commented, “They would have
killed us without him. He con-

trolled both boards and we still
couldn’t put it in the basket.” De-
spite Ditka and Hyatt, the Pirates
fell to the charging Steele-rs, led
by Don “The Bomb" Hennon,
23-20.

the return of; Hyatt to his alma-
mater appeared when Boo Con-
nors, Panther equipment man,
decided to make sure the old-
time All-American wore the
same Jersey he had when he
was leading the Panthers tothe
National championship.
It happened that Hyatt wore the

same number that Hennon wore ‘

when he played. To complicate
matters even more, number ten
had been retired and there were
no available jerseys with that
number.

So Boo had to have one jersey
made special for the charity game.
But Saturday night’s Charity con-
test will be the last time any Pitt
basketballer w'e;ars number ten.

Michigan Gains Momentum
From then on Michigan gained
momentum as theyswept the 167
and 177 pound classes and won the
heavyweight match by default.
The Panthers got off on the
right foot when Dick Martin

downed Willard Root, 5-2, in the .

123 pound bout. Lauchle then
lost. Coach Rex Peery decided
to send Dave Osmun, a sopho-

more who had beaten Syra.cuse’s ‘

The Michigan matmen won
easily 7-0.

The only pin of the afternoon
came in the 167 pound class. Don
Fitzgerald floored Augie Arrigone
with 4:42 left in the bout. Fitz-
gera]d’s pin virtually clinched the
victory for Michigan. With only
two bouts remaining the Cats
needed two pins to win the match.

Jim Harrison, who also was
wrestling 20 pounds over his nor-
mal weight, was strong-armed by

Jack Barden, 5-2, in the final
match.

Mermen to Meet Maryland  

«CI

Sollinger To Face
Ostranger in Duel

Of Backstrokers

By ED HOWARD

The Panther swimming
team puts its modest one-
game winning streak on the
line this Saturday, when they
take on the Terrapins of
Maryland in a dual meet
scheduled for 8 p.m. at Maryland’s
pooh _

Maryland boasts a fine 6-2 rec-
ord and ﬁgures to be one of the
finest units the Blue and Gold will
face. One of the two losses was to
North Carolina State, the team
that beat the local mermen in
their ﬁrst meet of the season.

Panther Coach Ben Grady isn’t
taking the visitors lightly, but he
sees a lot to be proud of in his
own charges. Sophomore back-
stroker Jcrrysollinger is a deﬁn-
ite strong point. The young Pan-
ther set two individual records
against Lehigh and helped set a
third. Tony Sarsﬁeld set a new
butterﬂy mark in the same meet
and is being counted on heavily
for a win.

‘The team is coming along
nicely,” says Coach Grady.
"They've shown a lot of poten-
tial and good team balance. Our
only weak spot seems to be a
lack of depth.”

They may need that depth
agains Maryland. The Terrapins
boast both speed and depth. They
have a breaststroke ace of their

Panther Cubs strength tonight

at the Field House."

own in Bob Ostrancier, who swims
the 200 yards in 2:16, almost three
full seconds under the new Pan-
ther mark setjust last week by
Sollinger.
Dick Scharule is tops in the
breaststroke, and Julius Lupi-
can gives the visitors a strong
man in freestyle competition.
The meet ﬁgures to be one of
the closest of the season, and
Coach Grady says that the out-

.come may _hinge on the medley

relay, the last event on the card.
The Panthers should show well in
this department, where a new
record was established against Le-
high.

Mouiltaineers to Test Cat Cubs

F0111‘-Game Win Skein Tonight

West Virginia Holds Perfect, 7-0, Slate;

Panther Coach Conﬁdent of 5th Straight
West Virginia freshmen will provide a valid test of the

as the Cats attempt to stretch

their four game winning streak. Tap-off time is set for 6 p.m.

The Panther frosh appear to be in top form after de-

feating a strong Kent State team 98-88 last week. The Moun-
taineers, however, have a strongé

team again this year and will be
‘putting their 7-0 record up before
the Cats hot shooting eye.

Coach Carl Peterson had no
trouble recalling the Blue and
Gold Cager’s two losses to the
Mountaineers last year.

“We will have to be at our
best tonight,” Peterson said.
“West Virginia has a strong
team as indicated by their rec-
ord. As Ilsaid before, I do. feel
this is the best team I have had
in recent years and I know we
can beat them.”

West Virginia’s top scorer is a
guard, Mike Barger. Barger has

far, hitting 54 of 108 shots from
the field for a 50.0 percent. He
also has hit on 15 of 36 foul shots.
Mountaineer statistics cover their
first six games.
- Center Tom Lowry is the Moun-
ties scorer with an 18 point-a-
game average. Lowry is also the
teams’ leading rebounder with 147,
over 80 above his -closest com-
petitor, Bill Maphis.
Maphis has averaged 14-plus
points a game, Jaye Deitz and Bob
Camp have hit 12 points a game.
The Mountaineers have 90
points-a-game this season as com-
pared to their opponents 66 points.

Racquetmen After

Improved Rating
By ART FLEISCHNER

Ben Pope’s racquetmen will
be out to improve their num-
ber 13 national rating this
Saturday against the Army
Cadets who are rated in the
top eight. According to as-
sistant coach, Bill Summers, who
is accompanying the team to the
Point, “Army is always one of the
strongest teams in the _countiv.”

“I have been trying to impiess
conditioning on my team,” says
head Coach Pope. “The service
teams are always in top form.”
Both Pope and Summers have
worked the team hard in pie-
paration for this match.

The youthful Summers, who
went to the Military Academy
last season, says of the Cadets,
-“Army was wcll—versed in the
basic fundamentals. Each man
had the same game and the same
basic strategy.” -

The Panthers need no added
incentive for this match. Re-
membrance of last year's 9-0
defeat is adequate. Returning
lettermen Ralph Mason, Lauren
Guthrie, Bill Hinkel, and Bill
Bennett are anxious for revenge.

Coach Pope had this to say,
“There is a great difference be-
tween our first five and last four
men. We are banking on one of
the last four to win.” 6

Assistant coach“ Summers said,
“I plan to take ten men" to this
match.” “There is a chance that
we may play Stephens, Adelphi,
or Princeton, all in the New York
area.”

The match at Princeton, ten-
tatively scheduled for this Fri-
day afternoon, will show the
Panther Racquetmen last year’s
intercollegiate champion Steve
Veslage.

New York Metropolitan Intercol-
legiate Tournament over the
-«Christmas holidays. Also appear-
ing in the Tiger lineup is Ralph
Howe, last ycar’s National Junior
Champion.

The ﬁve-division IM basket-
ball is set to open play early

ber of teams and players ready

gym will be open again this
