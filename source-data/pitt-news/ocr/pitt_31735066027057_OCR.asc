Dean of busi school to retire

By Kathleen Scanlon
News Editor

Zoffer said this is a transition time for the

school and it makes sense to make a transition to

a new dean.

The man who reigned  dean of Pitt’s gradu-
ate school of business for 27 years, while its
worldwide reputation steadily climbed, has
announced that he will retire June 30, 1996.

H.J. Zoffer, 64, was named dean of the Katz
Graduate School of Business in 1968 and has the
longest tenure among all major business school

deans in the United States.

“At the earliest, it will be 28 years and that
depends on the ability of the search committee
[to find a replacement],’’ Zoffer said. “I think
that after that amount of time, one is ‘entitled to

be released from bondage.”

“This is a very crossroads period," he said.
“We’re opening up a new undergraduate college,
instituting a new curriculum.” .

Also, Zoffer said he would like to spend more
time with his grandchildren. After his retirement,
he will serve as dean emeritus to help with the
school’s fundraising efforts and will eventually

— return to teaching and research.

While Zoffer has served as dean, the school
has hit a number of milestones, including the
construction of a new building, the implementa-
tion of a new MBA curriculum and the establish-

Engineers
study
treatment
of waste

By Christopher Lawrence
For The Pitt News

For years, the saying was
fight fire with fire. Now,
thanks to a Department of
Energy contract, engineers at
the University of Pittsburgh
are rewriting the statement,
making it fight waste with
waste.

The U.S. Department of
Energy has awarded a contract
to the University of Pittsburgh
School’ of Engineering Center
for Energy Research to evalu-
ate the use of by-products from
advanced sulfur removal sys-
tems in the treatment of metal-
laden hazardous wastes.

“Much of the coal from the
western. Pennsylvania region
contains fairly high levels of
sulfur,” said Ronald Neufeld,

T professor of civil engineering

and co-principal investigator
on the project. “Electric com-
panies that burn this type of
coal will produce sulfur diox-
ide, which is in violation of
certain clean air standards.”

Electric companies can solve
this problem by adding some-
thing to the stacks to clean out
the sulfur. One way to do this
is to add lime into a scrubber.
which removes impurities
from a gas. The material in the
scrubber reacts with the sulfur
dioxide, forming calcium sul-
fite and calcium sulfate. The
process produces sludge com-
prised of ash from the scrubber
as well as excess lime. _

“It is this excess lime that
has commercial value.“
Neufeld said.

University engineers are tak-
ing a look atusing the solid
waste that contains a lot of
excess lime to convert certain

kinds of metal-laden hazardous’

waste into a non-hazardous
form. ‘

The Pitt News

The Pitt News has agreed to a one-year printing contract with
Renaissance Publications, ending a long-standing relationship
with Typecraft Press.

Renaissance won‘ the right to print The Pitt News after the
contract was bid to local vendors. The Pitt News media adviser.
Jim Tynen, said he is looking forward to working with
Renaissance.

“The bids were very carefully scrutinized by The Pitt News
professional staff, by the student executives and by the purchas-
ing department,” Tynen said. “Our consensus was that the bid by
Renaissance was too good to pass up.”

The Editor in Chief of The Pitt News, Mark Gordon, said that
switching printers had nothing to do with the controversy stirred
when Typecraft refused to print pictures that it considered
pornographic last March.

“The problems with the photos was not a significant factor,”
added Tynen.

The contract for printing The Pitt News ends every June 30
and Tynen said that bids will likely be solicited from Typecraft
again next year.

"We bid out the printing contract every year," said Tynen.
"This year Renaissance Publications put in a bid for the first
time."

Renaissance, located near Duquesne University, also prints the
Pittsburgh Renaissance News, a weekly black newspaper, and
The Greater Pittsburgh Black Business Directory & Resource

Students help improve Russian births

By Jennifer Haluska
For The Pitt News

On May 9, student volun-
teers from Pitt travelled to
Moscow as part of an effort
to help improve health condi-
tions for women and children
in Russia.

The student team assisted
Magee Womancare
International, the humanitari-
an international outreach arm
of Magee Women’s Hospital,
in the renovation of a
Western—style birthing facili-
ty. When the “birth house” is
completed, it will be the first
of its kind in the former
Soviet Union.

The new birthing house
will be located at Savior’s
Hospital of Peace and Charity

In addition to the develop-
ment of the birth house, the
partnership between Magee
and Savior’s hospital has
yielded an Education Center
which is now being replicated
in 24 cities in Russia, and a
family planning clinic.
Students found the clinic to
be an important addition to
the country, since they report
that abortions represent a pri-
mary method of birth control.

“It isn’t uncommon to have
about 400 abortions per-
formed a month,” said one
volunteer. The students said
they were pleased to learn of
funding to increase the num-
ber of clinics, now totaling
26, throughout Russia.

Students participating in
the trip included Brook Boyd,

Hospital in the geriatric and
pediatric units.

The students also faced the
challenge of adjusting to liv-
ing conditions in Russia.

“Life in Russia is much
harder than it is in the United
States,” said Salo, one of the
volunteers. “They don’t have
nearly as much as we do.”

Students said one surprising V

revelation was the hardships
that the hospitals experience
on a daily basis. According to
the volunteers, children are
fed in their cribs and receive
little personal contact. Nurses
work 24-hour shifts, and the
lack of medication and sani-
tation is staggering.

“Once they had to spray for
roaches in the babies’ nurs-
ery, and they were doing it

in Moscow. Savior’s Stephanie LeDonne, Dova while the babies were still in

allowed to open
any windows,

because they
don’t have
screens and

they have a ter-

turally sensitive
model of obstetric care.
Together, they are attempting
to bring Western technology
to Russia and adapt it to
Russian culture.

Current obstetric practice
requires women to leave their
husbands behind as they are
placed in a room with
approximately eight other
women. When it is time to
deliver, they are moved to a
room with only five other
women, still receiving no pri-
vacy and unable to have a
partner at their side. The new
birthing center will provide
more Western-style technolo-
gies, privacy and a more fam-
ily—oriented atmosphere.

Wilson, Elizabeth Weber,
Sandra Macurak, Maria
MacDonald, Stephanie Salo,
Maegon Barlow and Matthew
Brady.

During their one-month
stay, the students had a busy
schedule. In addition to their
work on the birthing center,
they volunteered their time to
teach English at both the ele-
mentary and high school lev-
elshand assisted in the care of
the individuals at Savior’s

rible mosquito problem.”

“The education and health
care is just so very different
from what we have,” said
Macurak.

Students said they gained a
better understanding of
Russian culture through the
volunteer experience.

“It was a great-experience,
and I am looking forward to
going back in the future,”
said Brady._

ment of an undergraduate busi-

Pitt Provost James Maher
credits Zoffer with much of the
business school’s success.

“A dean provides all kinds of
leadership —— recruiting faculty
and helping the existing faculty
to keep refining the curriculum,

working to keep recruitment of

students effective and work-
ing,” Maher said.

“Over the years, the school
has done well and Dean Zoffer
deserves a lot of credit for
that.”

U.S. News and World Report
recently ranked the Katz
Business School as high as
36th in the nation.

“The school is a lot higher
than it was 27 years ago when
the dean took office,” Maher
said.

The school’s inflating inter-
national reputation is shown by
the fact that one—third of its stu-
dents come from outside the
United States.

Some of the factors of the
business school’s success
include the quality of the facul-
ty, the knowledge of the corpo-
rate community about the
activities of the school and the
business community’s strong
support, Zoffer said.

As dean, Zoffer said he has
been able to provide an envi-
ronment that attracts high qual-
ity faculty and to secure a sup-

portive relationship with the

business community.

need to work together to create
the kind of environment that

This and many other chal-
lenges lie ahead for Zoffer’s
successor.

“This is a period of growth
and development for the
school,” Zoffer said. “We’re
hoping to move forward on a
new building.”

The undergraduate business
school is scheduled to open this
fall. Fundraisers need to raise
around $20 million for the
building.

“The challenges are how to

environment in a changing

cancer, vaccinations of cer-
tain peptides could possibly
stimulate the immune system
of melanoma victims to fight
the disease. «

The melanoma study will
involve 36 patients divided
into equal groups. Over six
weeks, the patients will
receive four weekly injec-
tions of various medications,
along with an immune stim-
ulant.

At the end of the sixth
week, investigators will
assess the effect of the vac-
cine by determining if
patients develop a skin reac-
tion against the cancer.

“This trial differs from the
vast majority of other vac-
cine trials for melanoma,
because we are vaccinating
individuals with part of a
specific melanoma peptide
rather than with whole
melanoma cells,” said Dr.
John Kirkwood, chief of
medical oncology at UPMC.

Kirkwood said that this
type of precision will deter-
mine which peptide best
triggers an immune response
against the disease.

At the clinical level, inves-
tigators will measure the
cancer’s response to the
treatment, and will track dis-
ease progression as well as
overall long-term survival.

“Pre-clinical data suggests
tumor-derived peptides can
be used to induce the
immune system to shrink,
and in some cases eliminate,
cancers in mice,” said Dr.
Michael Lotze, clinical co-
investigator of the study and
UPMC professor.

Currently this type of clin-
ical research is also being
conducted at the National
In-stitutes of Health in
Bethesda, Md., and in con-
junction with the Ludwig
Institute for Cancer Research
in Brussels, Belgium, and
Switzerland.

As one of 26 National
Cancer Institute-designated
comprehensive cancer cen-
ters, the UPCI specializes in
the detection, diagnosis, pre-
vention and treatment of
cancer, as well as research
such as this study.

Davis

The Pitt News, ‘Wednesday, July 5, 1995

°From page I
named after City Theatre’s previous president,
acknowledges excellence in the arts, both as an
artist and a volunteer. -

Davis came from a divided family and spent his
childhood in Kansas City, two blocks from where
the famous Charlie “Bird” Parker grew up. ~

Davis worked hard throughout his life to get to
where he is today. He’s had many non—jazz jobs,
ranging from shoveling chicken droppings to
washing dishes. He’d work the night shift, and
then get up for school at 7 a.m.

“I was also a paperboy —- which was about the
cleanest job I ever had,” said Davis, laughing.

Davis said he feels that he has led quite an inter-
esting life here in the United States and overseas.

‘But more importantly, Davis said he has n

regrets. *

Davis lived in France for a large portion of his
life. He is ﬂuent in both French and Gennan. His
wife is from Berlin. In Paris, Davis performed at
the Blue Note for five of the seven-and—a—half
years he lived there.

At the Blue Note, Davis worked closely with
jazz musician Kenny Clark. During his stay in
Paris, Davis met everyone from Elizabeth Taylor
to jazz great Miles Davis. Here in the United
States, Davis has on occasion preformed at the

’ White House for past presidents.

Yet despite all of the things Davis has accom-
plished, he still feels as though there’s a lot to be
done.

“I haven’t achieved even half of the things I
want to do in life,” said Davis. Thus, he is always
busy with a new project.

He recently released a new CD “I’m a Fool to
Want You,” on the Tomorrow International label.
Also, his book “African—American Music in
Society,” was published earlier this year by Simon
and Schuster.

Currently, he is recording a new CD and ﬁnish-
ing the final revisions on the fifth edition of his

jazz history book. Jazz legend Grover Washington —

will write the introduction to the new edition.

“But what is more important in my life than any
records that I ’ve made, any books that I’ve written,
any concerts that I’ve ever done, any great people

I’ve met is the time that I’ve spent with my two
kids,” said Davis. “Raising them was the most pre-
cious thing.”

Davis said that he would rather give up jazz than
surrender the memories he’s experienced with his
daughter, Joyce Natalie, and his son, Pierre Marc
(who also produced his fatl1er’s latest CD).

“There are certain things in life that are more
important than fame. For me, it was the love of my
kids.”

Davis instructs Jazz History, Jazz Improvisation,
Jazz Arranging and African American Music. He.
also teaches the saxophone and directs the Jazz
Ensemble among many other university activities.

Because of Davis’ busy schedule, he has turned
down many world-wide tours and concerts.
During the weekend of our interview, he was
scheduled to play in Hamburg and Berlin.

Davis takes his job at Pitt very seriously, and he
has always tried to balance school and music for
the sake of his students. ‘

“I’m not son'y I came to Pitt, and ever since I’ve
been here I’ve made a conscious effort to be here
physically.”

At many other schools, music professors may

tour for weeks at a time, only showing up for their

students’ exams.

“I am very serious about balancing being a
musician and being a scholar,” says Davis.

“When I’m teaching, I’m sincere, and I know
the importance of that to the students. And when I
play, I don’t just do it to be popular, I play because
I really believe in it.”

Davis also encourages all Pitt students to take
advantage of the cultural diversity offered by this
large university.

“The world is no longer isolated. The one thing
that students can learn the most from is meeting
other people.”

In all of Davis’ travels and experiences, he
found one common thread: all people are essen-
tially the same.

“Everybody needs love and everybody wants
respect, regardless of culture or race. And in the
end, we’re all human beings. A

“Education isn’t always in the books. Humanity
is what it’s all about.”

Don't bow to Cl bomber

Seventeen years, 16 bombs, 23 people brutally injured and
three people killed. Since 1978 the Unabomber has orches-
trated one of the most sophisticated serial crimes in history
while managing to escape detection by the authorities.’

The man responsible for this string of terror 1S virtually
undetectable. Hehas been able to cover his tracks almost
entirely; leaving few clues for the authorities to follow. His
devices are well—crafted and well-planned. This man- is what

 

   

53‘l"tL9- The W0
mos’? Daueekous

one might call a criminal mastermind.

The Unabomber’s ability to perpetrate the perfect crime,
however, is compromised by his need for attention. After
publicity was diverted from his terrorism and directed toward
the Oklahoma City bombing, the Unabomber apparently got
jealous. He lost the limelight and wants it back. And he will
do anything to get it. 4 ‘

The latest stunt of this megalomaniac is an attempt to have
his 35,000’ word manifesto printed in The New York Times,

The Washington Post or Penthouse. Criminal psychologists in

California (according to Newsweek) believe he is doing this
as an explanation for his behavior and to gain acceptance.
The Unabomber has also issued a statement that if his man-
ifesto is printed, we have his word that he will not kill any
more people. But don’t give him the humanitarian-of-the-
year award just yet. If the manifesto is printed in Penthouse
instead of one of the (in his words) “respectable” publica-
tions, he has reserved the “right” to kill one more person.

three annual follow-up statements be published.

The magnitude of what the Unabomber is asking is difficult
to understaind by simply stating the number of words he
wrote. His manifesto would be roughly the equivalent of
seven full pages of The Times or The Post, not counting the
follow-up statements. The papers would also risk the loss of
advertisers if they ran such an absurd piece of writing.

It has been argued that if the manifesto is not printed, more
people will die. This may be true, but more people may die
even if the article is printed. It is ridiculous to assume that if
either of these papers ran the Unabomber’s writing he would
keep his "promise. One only needs to think as far back as
Waco to remember that the promises of criminals are worth-
less. David Koresh was given the air-time he demanded, but
the people he promised to release died in his fire. The
Unabomber is a criiiiiﬁal’, a murderer. ‘His word is worthless-.

It is also ridiculous to consider giving in to a terrorist’s
demands. This is America, not a terrorist stronghold. No one
has the right to kill people and be rewarded with getting what
he or she wants. When was the last time you whacked your
brother or sister and had your mother ask you what you want-
ed for a reward? Giving in to the demands of terrorists sends
only one message to potential threats: We are helpless against
you.

The Post and The Times should do with the Unabomber’s
writing what he has done to so many people — burn it. It
should not be printed in full, in excerpts or even one word a

‘ day in jigsaw- puzzle form. Doing so would only validate the

Unabomber’s actions and plant the seed of suggestion in the
minds of other potentialkillers.

Columnist every citizen
Mark has the right to

Gordon pursue life, lib-
.erty and happi-

ness. Its constitution, over
200 years old, has been imi-
tated and copied by nations
across the world, only it’s
never done just as good.

When Thomas Jefferson
and his crew of patriots
defected from England in
1776, they did it to form
“government for the people,
by the people.” It was the
first form of democracy ever
in the world. .

So if America is so great,

how come so many people
have a hard time and are
uncomfortable identifying
what it means -to be an
American?
 Because America today is
imbedded in a rights revolu-
tion where multiculturalism
and political correctness take
precedence over common
sense and logic.

Multiculturalism (read:
dividing people into groups)
is slowly destroying our soci-
ety and making people ‘second
guess what it means to be
American. Multiculturalism is
succeeding in teaching our
youth how everyone in
America is different,’ which in
turn divides lines between
those groups.

The solution, the way to
destroy multiculturalism and
PC has arrived and, surpris-
ingly, it’s not that complicat-
ed. President Clinton even
managed to use it in his 1992
con (whoops, I mean run) for
office.

It’s America first, stupid.
We must to stop dividing
everyone into little groups
and factions, stop playing
tug-of-war over what lan-
guage should be spoken in a
city with predominantly
Hispanics.

We are all Americans, first

. and foremost. And when you

are a part of this country you

follow the rules like speaking

English, paying your taxes
and not setting fire to any-
thing, including a flag. (It’s
called arson.)

The first step toward beat-
ing multiculturalism is elimi-
nating those silly politically
correct titles for all the
groups they have created. No
more African-Americans,
Afro-Americans or people of
color, as Jesse Jackson once
suggested. No more Pacific-
Islander, Asian-American or
Latin-American.

It should be American-
Africans, or American-

. Hispanics or American-
Polish. Respect and remem-
ber your heritage, it’s a part
of who you are, but America
should come first, that’s also
a part of who you are.

Remember, it’s America
first.

Along with dividing our
society into racial factions,
the evils of multiculturalism
have spread, threatening the

language we speak in
America. In an effort to show
the importance of different
languages and not hurt any-
one’s feelings, multicultural-
ists have mariifested the
belief that Hispanics have the
right to speak Spanish, and be
spoken to in Spanish, whether
they are in a public airport or
a bookstore.

That absolutely defies any
reasonable logic and contin-
ues to separate our society.

Almost every country in the
world has a language, under-
stood to be the language
everyone speaks. I

If you got a job in France,
would you expect everyone
there to adopt to English, or
would you learn their lan-
guage? Obviously, you would

learn French. Also, there i

were millions of Europeans
who immigrated to America
in the early 19003, next to
none of them who spoke
English. They learned
because they wanted to be
Americans.

But multiculturalists stress
that everyone’s culture is
equally important, and the PC
police don’t want anyone’s
feelings to be hurt. The result
is a few cities across
America, such as Miami,
screaming for the right to
declare Spanish as their offi-
cial language.

America is a wonderful,
enormous place, with mil-
lions of people who come
from thousands of back-
grounds. That is something to
be cherished", the diversity we
have in this country. We can
learn and grow from these
cultures, maybe even one day

become more _tolerant of cul-

tures we don’t understand.

But we can’t accomplish
that by following the example
of multiculturalism and divid-
ing America into little
groups.

Remember, it’s America
first.

Smoke

Directed by Wayne Wang
With Harvey Keitel, William
Hurt, Forest Whitaker and
Harold Perrineau Jr.

Something like seven char-
acters in search of a director,
much of Smoke is a 90-
minute, four-chapter prelude to
the semi'short “Auggie Wren’s
Christmas Story.” But I didn’t
realize this until those final
credits rolled. The stories lead-
ing up to the final ten minutes
are engaging enough — coin-
cidence—laden, serendipitous
tales toying with the idea of
fate —— but it’s like reading imi-
tation first and then
Hemingway. Or truer to
Smoke’s form, imitation then
Jarmusch. '

With the long takes and slow
tracking shots emphasizing
story, Smoke aspires to be lit-
erary cinema. With the excep-
tion of the final ten minutes,

Wang finally tells “Auggie

Depending on your persua-
sions, Auggie Wren (Harvey
Keitel) is either a cigar store
manager or an existential pho-
tographer. His Brooklyn Cigar
Shop anchors the film’s sense
of place, as well as Auggie’s

life. Every morning at 8 a.m.

or so, Auggie stands adjacent.

to his shop and takes a photo-
graph. lt’s the same shot from
the same place everyday. His
shop, at that moment, evenly
spaced twenty-four hours
apart. Auggie’s friend Paul
Benjamin (William Hurt), a
writer who frequents the shop,
has been miserable since his
wife was killed by a stray bullet
from a shoot-out. When
Auggie shows Paul his photo-
graph book, he tells Paul to
slow down — each photograph

is different. lt’s this focus on
the ugly-beauty of urban
America, and the self-con-
scious process of observing
the mundane, that makes crit-
ics stop and drop the
Jarmusch reference.
Benjamin brings Rashid
Cole (Harold Perrineau, a
newcomer to the screen) into
the narrative when he walks in
front of a moving truck and
Cole knocks him out of the
way. A friendship ensues, and
the story follows Cole as he
seeks out his father, Cyrus
Cole (Forest Whitaker). Cyrus

is like all the men in Smoke;
he carries the burden of lost
love and a bruised past with
him. And we learn Rashid is
also running from a past, while
at the same time trying to
recover a relationship with his
father. The father/son relation-
ship is a motif played with
throughout the film. Wang
goes so far as to include
American-pie surrogate father
sequences with Paul and
Fiashid watching the Mets on a
black & white TV. Women are
relegated to the periphery of
Smoke, and this phallus-fixat-

ed film is quintessentially
about males and male bonding
(what's with all those cig-
ars??? Just kidding).

Smoke is a fine film with
plenty of New York stories to

hold your attention. Aside from .

“Auggie Wren’s Christmas
Story,” the montage sequence
from Auggie’s snapshot album
is fine moment, if paradoxically
fictitious, of verité photography
a la the Lumiere brothers.

Smoke runs daily at 12:45,
3:05, 5:20, 7.40 and 10:00 at
the Squirrel Hill Theater.

Hong Kong cinema embraces
something which American film

smooth and meaningful philoso-

intenseness comes from their per-

good storyline. I can’t even imagine

The Tragedy of Macbeth
directed by Mladen Kiselov
Three Rivers Shakespeare Festival

 

.“Double, double, toil and trouble;
fire burn, and cauldron bubble.’’ The
Three Rivers Shakespeare Festival
has brewed up a classical masterpiece
depicting a long respected tale, of
ancient Scottish conspiracy and mur-
der. .

Macbeth has been sacred in the the-
ater world for centuries and in turn has

‘ had numerous interpretations. Mladen

Kiselov, a Bulgaria-born director who
has worked in such theaters as Actors’
Theater of Louisville and Moscow Art

. Theater, brings the play to the audi-

ence using a lot of antique theater tra-

‘ ditions. There aren’t a lot of elaborated

antics that tend to confuse an audience
who isn't well exposed to
Shakespeare. The actors provide a
clear cut understanding by keeping the
set and blocking simple. Slanted at an
incline, the stage gives the appearance
of the classical theater used back when
women were not allowed on stage.
Interesting enough, the threeiinfa-
mous witches are not played by
women, but men, Martin Giles, Tom
Lee and Robert Beir. Kiselov’s three
male “sisters” provide the play with a

‘priceless comic relief which might oth-

erwise have been lost with the original

7 sinister women. Mystery and intrigue is

suspended throughout the story by
keeping portions of the backstage
wings exposed to the audience. This
way the characters waiting to come on

, T stage keep a foreboding connection
 with the scene. Cleverly enough the

three cynical witches keep a playful

 

       
  

  
 
 

eye /on the entirety of the plot, monitor-

ing the diabolical r.t=z‘ox/isions. of A/!az;:b€3t9“
and Lady Macbeth.

The periormarices of Macbeth
(Bradley Dean) and Lady Macbeth
(Kristin Sentman) reached out to their
audience with a profound depth and
intensity. The talent and insight that the
actors bring to life makes this perfor-
mance throb with theatrical vitality.
Each scene stays sensitive to each
other, never leaving the audience to
rest. Playing into the vulnerability of the
characters, the cast challenges the

play with an enchanting freshness. And _

it's evident that there is an immense
amount of professionalism at work. The
quality of each actor's performance is
sharp and polished, contributing to the
brilliance of this renowned piece of lit-
erature.

Such actors as Thom Devanthal,
John E. Reily and John C. Wanamaker
return to the festival, bringing a dynam-
ic reputation with them to contribute in
the creation of Macbeth, in light that
audiences won't get caught up in the
exalted language using the purity the

a players incorporate into the dark leg-

end. The forethought and vision is a
success in this case and is emotionally
penetrating to experience.

This unchained performance focuses
on the crucial elements of prophecy
and morality underlining the darkness
of the play. Each player and prop per-
forms in Macbeth finely tuned in order
to achieve a dynamic interpretation of a
timeless legacy. l hath not a single foul
tongue for such profound brilliance.

Macbeth will ‘run through July 15th.

The Hollow, which is located

these are some mutated hybrids

product of its environment.
They live in sewage-like condi-

Just looking at the stagnant

are absolutely no ﬁsh in there.
But at a closer glance you can
see serious movement and bub-

ﬁshed at the Hollow several

was ﬁshing for bass. Let me set
the record straight, there’s no
bass there.

Finally I gave up on bass and
bought some nightcrawlers. At
last, the secret of the Hollow
was solved. All you need to do
to catch sunfish by the second

a small hook and ﬂip it out
about three feet from the shore

Reel ‘em in and you have the
smallest, raunchiest sunﬁsh
ever caught by man. It may not
be the toughest ﬁght, or very
ghallenging, but if you like to
catch fish, then this is the way

Former linebacker relurns Io camp

//

By Brad Isles
Sports Editor

On a hot and sunny summer day, former Pitt All-
American linebacker and six—year Pittsburgh Steeler
Jeny Olsavsky strolls off the turf at Pitt Stadium.

He jokes around with a trainer, gives him‘ a little
bearhug and then sends him off on a mission — out to

his car, “the black one.”

A short time later the trainer returns, a small bag in
his hands. Olsavsky takes out his sunglasses and casual—

ing to go to

and coach" [Majors].”

He seems at case on the ﬁeld where he terrorized .
opponents for four years as an “undersized” linebacker.

Olsavsky came to Pitt from Chaney High School, in
Youngstown, Ohio, where he averaged 18 tackles a
game in his senior year. He also hadeight sacks and
forced six fumbles on his way to being named to the
All-City team and receiving the Mike DeNiro award for

being the top defensive lineman in the city.

In his freshman campaign, Olsavsky played in ﬁve

games and collected 10 tackles.

In his next three years as a starter, he became the ﬁrst
player since 1976 to record more than 100 tackles in
three straight seasons. Olsavsky collected 127 (78 unas-
sisted) in. 11 games in.1986, with a season-high 17
against Notre Dame. He continued in 1987 with 101

kind of just dead time. But, I like working with the kids.

Then in his senior campaign, he had a career-high 

129 (84 unassisted) in 11 games on his way to earning

Kodak All-American honors.

After such a successful collegiate career and a pre-
senior ranking as the 14th-best inside linebacker cour-
tesy of The Sporting News, Olsavsky’s future was
unclear. He was projected by many scouts as being too
small at 6-2, 218, to be a successful inside linebacker in

the NFL.

Sophomores ruletop four spots in NBA draft

By Matt Grove"
Staﬂ Writer

Basketball gurus were anxiously
awaiting the 1995 NBA Draft last
Wednesday in Toronto. Many had
branded this draft as one of the best in
recent memory, and they were not dis-
appointed.

Unlike last year’s draft, when
Milwaukee fell head over heels for the
Big Dog, there was no clear-cut No. 1
pick for the Golden State Warriors. But
when Commissioner David Stern made
his way to the SkyDome podium, mil-
lions watched as history was made.

Hurting for size, Golden State made
Maryland center Joe Smith the first
pick overall.

The lowly L.A. Clippers then select-
ed Alabama sophomore Antonio
McDyess second. McDyess wasn’t a
Clipper for long, as L.A. dealt him and
Randy Woods to Denverfor former
Wake Forest star Rodney Rogers and
Brent Barry (No. 15).

The Philadelphia 76ers got just what
they wanted when they‘ selected Jerry

Stackhouse third overall.

Numerous reports had Philly possi-
bly trading up to get the No. 1 ’
order to guarantee Stackhouse, b
wasn’t needed, and the Sixers have

 
 

instantly become a playoff threat with K

the addition of the former UNC
Tarheel.

Dean Smith cringed again at No. 4
pick, when the Washington Bullets
selected Rasheed Wallace. The 6-10
Wallace joins Chris Webber and Juwan
Howard on the now-awesome Bullet
frontline.

The most interesting pick came at
No. 5 when prep phenom Kevin
Garnett was thrown to the_Wolves.
This gamble will hopefully pay off for
the struggling Timberwolves, the only
expansion team that hasn’t made the

» postseason since entering the league.

“This is a tremendous step,” said
Garnett. ‘‘All I want to do is win, and
I’ll play whatever role they want me to
play there.”

Five other underclassmen were cho-
sen in the first round, setting a new
NBA record at 10.

These players are Gary Trent of Ohio
University, No. 1-1 to Milwaukee and

 
 rkansas at No. 13 to Sacramento;
’Memphis’ David Vaugh, 25th to the

then later traded to Portland; 1994
F’ _al Four MVP Corliss Williamson of

Magic’; Mario Bennett of Arizona State
at No. 27 to Phoenix; and finally,
injury‘-prone Virginia guard Cory
Alexander was the final first-round
pick, going to the Spurs.

Each year, players raise their stock
with good performances in pre-draft
camps. This year was no exception.

Oregon State guard Brent Barry
vaulted to No. 15, while UCLA center
George Zidek played his way to
Charlotte at No. 22. .

Other players who fared well were
Georgia Tech point guard Travis Best,

University of Illinois—Chicago’s.

Sherell Ford and former Iowa State
Cyclone Loren ‘Meyer. '

On the other hand, there were a few
players who maybe shouldn’t have
punched their ticket to the camps.

Tech’s James Forrest, ODU guard
Petey Sessoms and Arkansas’ hopeful
Scotty Thurman were all question

marks in camp and did not get selected.

“We’ve got some changes, but I’m excited that I’m going back to
camp again, after not being there last year,” he said. “It’s a pretty big
thing for me. .

Chad [Brown] and Levon [Kirkland] had great years [last season],
and it might be tough to get my starting job back, but I think that I can
really lend a hand on special teams. Then, if somebody gets hurt or if
they want to put me in there for a couple of plays, I think l’ll be all
right.”

Olsavsky also remembers who groomed his play for the NFL. He

And, with playing in Pittsburgh, he still ﬁnds time to make it to a few
games.

“It’s always great when I see Pitt guys on the road,” he said. “We
always keep in contact, and it’s something I look forward to.”

Who knows, this year he may be trying to get at Jim Kelly through
former Panther, and newly-signed Bills’ lineman, Ruben Brown.

As far as coach Major’s camp goes, Olsavsky helps out wherever he
can.

“I’m going to help with the linebackers,” he said. “I’m, going to try
and show them some things and that football is not all size.”

Hopefully the kids will listen, because if anybody should know
about beating the odds, it’s Olsavsky.
