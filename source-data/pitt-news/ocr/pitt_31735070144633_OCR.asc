University officials say they’re

working to ensure that Pitt students‘

don’t get cut out of an act that
provides additional ﬁnancial aid to
Pennsylvania college students.

But they won’t say exactly what
they’re doing. V

Gov.  Rendell’s Tuition Relief
Act, proposed earlier this month,

would give qualifying students up

to $7,600 to use for tuition, fees,
room and board if they attend one
of the state’s 28 community colleg-
es or state schools. The act would

exclude students who attend state- .
related schools, such as Pitt and

The Web site changed its terms

of use on Feb. 4 to add a provision‘

that gave it “an irrevocable, perpet-

The new terms of use stayed

Canada:  education system doomed

by Molly Stieber
Sta_/]"' Wrder

The US. education system will
fail, said one education specialist, if
its left solely to the government

Education is the whole commu-
nity’s responsibility, Geoffrey Canada,
president and CEO of Harlem Chil-
dren’s Zone, an organization that pro-
vides educational programs for poor
families, told a group of students and
adults gathered in the Cathedral of
Learning Thursday afternoon.

“The same geniuses that de-
stroyed the economy of this nation
are in charge of preparing this nation
for the ﬁiture,” he said. “No one is
 to save your children but you.

“We have created a system in this
country, and if we continue with this
system, we are  to destroy our
nation,” he added.

Canada said the United States is
stuck in the past It “focuses on the
wrong problems, he said A coun-
try’s strength, he added, . is not in
how many bombs it has, but in how
many people with doctorates it can
produce. '

“How come countries like In-
dia and China are preparing their

-children for global competition and

we are not?” he asked. “I have met

plans. You are the only way 
can be made.”

Having grown up in a poor sec-
tion of the South Bronx, Canada
said he could directly relate to the ef-
fects that lack of education can have
on children in a poor community.
He said he thought children 
in these communities needed some-
thing to keep them off the streets.

So, he founded the Harlem Chil-
dren’s Zone. The organization, which
works block by block to serve about
8,000, people in . central Harlem,
New York City, provides parenting

Professor: Students can't

expect privacy on   Facebook

Facebook, page 1

the story.

As Facebook users started expressing pri-
vacy concerns, groups sprung up on the site
condemning the revision and calling on the
Web site’s founder and CEO Mark Zucker-
berg to revoke the new changes.

Fewer than 24 hours after the Consurner—
ist article, Zuckerberg, in a post on Facebook,
tried to reassure users that the change was not
ill-intentioned and that people still have con-
trol over their content.

But many users weren’t satisﬁed, and they
dismissed the statement as a public relations

_ Ploy-

The temporary revision received massive
organized protest — on Facebook.

Groups like “People Against the New
Terms of Service” grew to more than 100,000
members. »

\V1th the wave of protests iising, Zuck—
erberg ﬁnally conceded. On \Wednesday, the
company withdrew the changes and re—enact—
ed the old terms of use — at least temporar-
ily —— in a move Zuckerberg called “the right
thing for now.”

“A couple of weeks ago, we revised our
terms of use hoping to  some parts for
our users,” wrote Zuckerberg in a Facebook
posting Wednesday. “Over the past couple
of days, we received a lot of questions and
comments about the changes and what they
mean for people and their information. Based
on this feedback, we have decided to return
to our previous terms of use while we resolve
the issues that people have raised.”

Consumeristcom declared the change
a temporary victory, but some remain con-
cerned about privacy issues as far as “who
owns what,” since Facebook’s terms of use,
while unchanged for now, will be revised at
some point.

Pitt law professor Michael Madison, who
specializes in Internet and copyright law, said
the notion that Facebook could do  it
wants under the Feb. 4 revision was “a bit of

an overstatement.” H
According to Madison, two  should
be noted about the now—revoked revision and
any future changes. A
“One is that Facebook may outsource
some of its tech support,” he wrote in an e-
mail. “You may take it down from Facebook,

but copies may still live on those other servers, , ,

even if they aren’t online. This part is Face-
book streamlining its business. The terms of
service change would make that OK

“Two is that the change reinforces some- 3

thing that has always been true about Face-
book and related sites: Never assume that
content that you upload is within your sole
contro .”

David Korman, an ethics professor in the

graduate schools of public and international I 1
affairs and public health, reinforced Madison’s L 

point about assumptions.

“One cannot have any reasonable expec— ; 

tation of privacy when using a‘ Facebook—like
service,” he said. “But a user probably does

not expect that what one posts can be used in , p.’

a proprietary manner by others.”

Pitt sophomore Ashley Bowen said any i if

outrage over possible changes to Facebook’s
terms of use is unnecessary.

She said she won’t remove old wall posts,
notes or pictures — not because her proﬁle
is devoid of  future employers might
deem even slightly inappropriate, but because
she  that an accurate record of her past
is important.

“That’s the historical record of my life,”
she said. “I’m in college. Can’t I go to a few
parties, realize that lifestyle isn’t for me and
not do it again?”

Bowen said that Facebook, despite it’s po-
tential piivacy ﬂaws, is still a media amalgama-
tion that “combines the best of blogging, net-
working and photo-sharing as a way to express
yourself and keep in touch with people”

“I love Facebook and would never get rid
of itj’ shesaid.

asked Canada.

“So many people will tell you the reasons

To the Editor, '

1 look forward to visiting the University of Pittsburgh next
month to speak with students about the situation in Palestine
and Israel, and in  to talk about paths to a future of
justice, equality, peace and freedom from any form of discrimi-
nation or violence for all the people .who inhabit that land

Your article on the Student Government _Board  hear-
ing for my visit quoted Becca Lehner of the group Panthers for
Israel saying about me: ‘We feel like he will notbring a message
of peace to the campus” and that on my previous visit, “We feel
that Abunimah personally affected students in a negative way.”

Another student, Aliyah Furman was concerned that I “would I

promote anti-Jewish views” and that my visit might cause “anti-
Semitism,” according to the Feb. 18 article, “SGB grants 
for pro—Palestinian speaker.” I

I am grateful SGB was not swayed by these inﬂammatory
statements I ﬁnd it deeply troubling that some zealous advo-
cates for Israel continually throw around such accusations in
wanton attempts to silence much needed critical discussion
about the situation in the Middle East; I am proud of my long

record of speaking out against all forms of racism, including
anti-Semitisrn. ‘ .

To the Editor,

The Executive Board of the College Democrats
would like to express our concern ,with Wednesdays
article titled, “Mayor discusses $250,000 trash can
bill.” This article showcased the worst kind of report-

Those who attended the event will recall that
Mayor Luke Ravenstahl spoke for an hour and a half
on a wide range of topics including infrastructure re-
pair, landlords in Oakland and the retention of young
people and businesses in the city of Pittsburgh.

The mayor spokecandidly and honestly about the
new waste receptacles in the city and disrniss_ed the
fact that his name appears on them as a non-issue.

As for the questioner’s charge of false fiscal con-
servatism, the balanced budgets of the past few years
speak for themselves. '

I close by emphasizing our displeasure not with
The Pitt News as an institution, but with the way in
which it covered this particular event

.Ian Lauer, on behalf of the College Democrats
Executive Board ' 1
President, College Democrats

To the Editor,

We are writing in response to Keith Giueglys column “Librar-
ies lose out to the Internet” in the Feb. 18 edition of The Pitt
News. .

° The mission- of the University Library System is, broadly, to

support the information needs of the students, faculty and staff of

the University
The modern library is something of a hybrid institution, yet it

fulﬁlls its traditional mission of providing information access ULS

is much more than the books it contains, for books provide only
one way of supporting Pitt’s diverse information needs

Parts of Hillman may look like a club thanks to the psychedelic

paint job, but open, collaborative workspace is a vital service for

many students who commute or are unable to study in their dorm

rooms. At the same time, those shelves full of book “fossils” are
essential to the research needs of .faculty and graduate students.
Information accessed electronically is not necessaiily free. The

0 online databases that Pitt students and faculty can access are paid

for and maintained by the library and meet stiingent quality stan-
dards. Even some free resources, notably government sites, may
require t:_he assistance of specially trained staff

Adding bass player Albritton
McClain, guitarist  Lee Hoe-

record the hits “Ah! Leah!” and “Ag-

Big East tournament

has new setup

by Randy Lieberman
Senior Staﬂ W/riter

_ Enlightenment is the word.

The Big East tournament
changed its format for 2009.
Well, now that it is getting close
to tournament time, let’s go over
what changes were made and
what they mean for some of this
year’s potential Big East tourna-
ment ﬁeld.

The conference armounced on

‘ Nov. 7, 2007, that the presidents

of the conference voted for ex-
panding the tournament ﬁeld to
16 teams to take effect starting
in 2009. That means each team
in the Big East — yes, even win-
less in-conference iDePaul — will
participate in the tournament at
Madison Square Garden in early
March. '

in '09
Before, the top 12 teams in
the ﬁnal regular-season standings
advanced to the tournament. The
new format will have the teams
seeded nine through 16 meet on
the ﬁrst day of competition. The
matchups will be No. 9 vs. No.
16, No. 10 vs. No. 15, No. 11 vs.
No. 14 and No. 12 vs. No. 13.
The winners of those four
games will meet seeds ﬁve
through eight on the second day
of play. The No. 9-16 winner will
advance to play the No. 8 seed.
The No. 10-15 winner will play
the No. 7 seed. The No. 11-14

winner faces the No. 6 seed. The

No. '12-13 winner will meet the
No. 5 seed. ,

Those four winners will ad-
vance to play the top four seeds
in the quarterﬁnal round. This
means that the top four seeds get

Lastof top four seeds  
in tourney up for grabs

Big East, page 10

a ﬁrst— and second-round bye in the tour-
nament, a valuable commodity during the
dog-days of March.

The locks for these top four spots, and
the subsequent bye to the quarterﬁnals,
looked to be Connecticut, Pitt, Louisville
and Marquette. But not so fast my friend.

The Tuesday before last, Villanova told
Marquette, “Sweet sassy molassey, you are
gonna pay a lot for this mufﬂer!” and swept
the floor with its golden wings in a 102-84
drubbing at The Pavilion.

The Wildcats took a seven-game win-
ning streak into Morgantown last Friday
and left with sore necks after watching
West Virginia’s Da’Sean Butler ‘chuck up
43 points to give the Mountaineers a 93-
72 win.

It was the second-highest individual
scoring effort in a Big East contest since
2003. Butler paced the Mountaineers’ pe-
rimeter game, going 6 for 13 from beyond
the arc. Somewhere, Kevin Pittsnogle
cracked a smile. ’

So the Wildcats are out of it, right?
Wrong. Just look at their schedule down
the stretch: at Syracuse, at DePaul, George-
town, at Notre Dame and Providence.

The Wildcats lucked out by having a
soft schedule, thanks to collapses from
Georgetown and Notre Dame. I

Now, Marquette on the other hand, its
schedule is of the sort we’re used ‘to seeing
in Big East play. The Golden Eagles ﬁnish
off the year at Georgetown, home against
Connecticut, at Louisville, at Pitt and home
against Syracuse. —

It’s a good thing for Wildcats coach Ja
Wright that his team is playing, well at the
right time. _ .

“\We’ve been playing good basketball,”

I said Wright. “We’ve been very fortunate
' to be getting great play off the bench and
- great leadership from our seniors.”

Leading the Wildcats’ push are senior
forward Dante Cunningham and junior

guard Scottie Reynolds.‘ Cunningham and

Reynolds are averaging .18 and 16 points,

respectively, in their last seven games, about

a point above their season averages. i
On to the awards:

. Big East Hammer on the Hard-
wood: _

If this award can’t go to Pitt’s DeJuan
Blair, then it has to go to,West Virginia’s
Butler. Come on, 43 points? He followed
thatup with a relatively pedestrian 19-point,
foiirl-rebound and four-assist game in a 79-
 over Notre Dame on Wednesday.

Big East Cupcake:

This is a shared award between Syracuse
forwards Arinze Onuaku and Rick Jackson.
Both disappeared beneath the towering

stature of Connecticut center Hasheem

Thabeet last Wednesday. Onuaku and Jack- '

son combined for just six points and 10 re-
bounds and allowed Thabeet to score eight
points, grab 16 rebounds and block seven
shots.

Big East Game of the
Week(s): . I

The Bulls’ Dominique Jones went coast-
to-coast and sunk a layup with 15 seconds
left to give South Florida a 57-56 lead over
Marquette Feb. 6. But the Bulls couldn’t re-
lax until two Marquette shots from under
the basket fell short, giving South Florida
the victory. The win was South Florida’s

at 1 p.m. in the Carrier Dome when Syra—. Y _
cuse hosts Villanova. But on Wednesday, I
Marquette gets a crack at the soon to be ‘'
.dethroned No. 1 Connecticut. This game 4
could go a long way in determining the ﬁ- 

nal Big East standings.

Big East Upset Special: _

Many out there are picking George-
town over Marquette. Yes, the'Hoyas are
desperate, but they’re still Georgetown. Af-
ter you watch the Golden Eagles triumph,

‘catch the Sunday game. Syracuse knows

how to bottle up dribble-driving guards,
which perfectly describes Villanova’s Scot-
tie Reynolds. Watch for the Orange to pull
the upset in this one.

iSallard's experience moves coach, teammates

S'allard’s story  the Panthers a little some-
thing extra to play for on Saturday.

“Iwouldlovetospreadtheawarenessespe-
ciallywith how that happened to my mother,” said
Sallard. l

The game takes place Saturday against Cincin-
nati, with tipoff scheduled for 2 pm

The Panthers and UPMC HealthPlan are join-
ingwith the Susan G. Komerrfor the Cure for the
second annual Pink the Petersen.

Pitt will donate $1 to the Susan G. Komen for
the Cure, a national foundation forbreast cancer
research, for every ticket sold Students can claim
their ticket online just as they would claim a men’s
basketball ticket As with all Pitt women’s basket-
ballgames, tickets are freeandareworth fourloy—

- alty points

The first 1,000 studentswillreceive a freepink
T-shirt and entry into the,Petersen Events Cen-
ter at12.-30 pm. for various activities such as face
painting and poster  Also, Oakland Zoo
manbers have the option of staying in their seats
through the Pitr men’s basketball game against
DePaul at 7 pm. ‘

Those students would have to present their
men’s and yvomenis game tickets when they arrive
for the women’s contest. ‘ ' -

“\We’re  to keep the concessions open for
[the students] and let them hang out in their seats
instead of  up outside,” said Pitt’s assistant
event presentation coordinator_Andrew Berenato
"‘We’ll probably put up the [North Carolina]-
Maryland men’s game on -the screen for them to
watch”

Fans are asked to join the Pitt players and
coaches in  pink in support of the efforts

“We’re proud the Oakland Zoois behind us,”
said Pitt senior Xenia Stewart '

No. 19-ranked Pitt (19-5, 9-3 Big East) enters
the game on a  note. The Panthers rebounded
